<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an in-studio appearance by Cheech and Chong.  The conversation covered Chong's recent release from prison, Cheech's acting alongside Tyne Daly, and anecdotes about Betty White and Cloris Leachman.  This transitioned into a discussion of bureaucratic frustrations, especially within the healthcare system, punctuated by a host's graphic anecdote about defecating on a New York City sidewalk.

A substantial portion of the show detailed Anthony Cumia's date with Taylor Vixen, Penthouse Pet of the Year.  The hosts recounted the evening in explicit detail, from dinner at a Brazilian steakhouse to drinks in the Meatpacking District, including the subsequent Twitter reaction to a photo of them.  Numerous sexually explicit jokes and comments accompanied the discussion, which continued with speculation about future encounters.  Callers contributed to this conversation, further fueling the sexually explicit jokes.  The show then delved into further explicit commentary about Vixen's physical attributes, including her feet, along with vulgar remarks regarding female appearance and body odor. The conversation shifted to show-related matters, discussing the lack of a website and the idea of creating individual and show-related apps.

Next, UFC fighter BJ Penn joined the show.  The interview covered his recent fight loss, training methods (including a demonstration of a jumping exercise), UFC weight-cutting techniques, his relationship with Dana White, and his new book.  Lighthearted banter ensued, including a playful "manly handshake" competition and a near-sparring match with a show staffer, Mars.  The conversation touched on controversial moments in Penn's career, and a caller briefly phoned in regarding a hypothetical app and commented on younger women with "daddy issues."  The hosts then engaged in character impersonations and vulgar banter before concluding the interview.  A later segment featured further discussion of Penn's career, including his multiple weight class championships, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training (and conflicts with the Gracie family), and comparisons between UFC and other martial arts cultures.  A humorous highlight involved Penn performing an arm bar on co-host Jimmy, resulting in an immediate submission.

A caller shared a viral video of his mother's reaction to his house being filled with cases of his new energy drink, "Vital Energy."  This was followed by another interview with Taylor Vincent (Taylor Vixen), who discussed her date with Anthony Cumia, including a near-arrest incident involving a public display of genitalia in the Meatpacking District and the intervention of Cumia's connections. The discussion also included tangents on NASA's space program and its funding, with caller input. The show continued with a humorous retelling of the arm bar incident between Jimmy and BJ Penn, with repeated analysis of a video of the event. A caller recounted a bad poker beat, and the hosts discussed another video showing a police incident where officers on horseback appeared to subdue a young man violently, speculating on the events leading up to the arrest.  The segment concluded with announcements of upcoming guests, including Bob Levy and Ashley Dupree, and a discussion of Dupree's Playboy spread.

The show continued with a graphic discussion of Ashley Dupree's Playboy pictorial, accompanied by crude commentary. This transitioned into a discussion of the "Milk, milk, lemonade" rhyme and then to Sam Roberts' new radio show, with playful banter about his on-air name.  This included a listener call-in segment featuring explicit and vulgar language and mentions of upcoming guests (Bob Levy, Ashley Dupree, and the Stanley Cup), which sparked further crude jokes.  A large portion focused on Opie's purchase of a spotter scope (referred to by various names), his efforts to disguise his voyeuristic intentions while buying it, and his detailed descriptions of using it to observe people across the Hudson River and in their apartments.  The conversation included further explicit jokes and anecdotes about his brother's voyeuristic tendencies. The segment concluded with mentions of videos on Opie's YouTube channel (including one with Jim Norton and BJ Penn), discussions of retail experiences, and more explicit jokes and anecdotes, along with additional listener calls.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, it's Sam. Hey, it's E-Rock from Opie and Anthony. More O&A coming up. Sam. Yeah.  Keaton Chong, we're in studio. Oh, I couldn't believe it. Comedy legends.  And the legends themselves right in front of us. Did you get a photo with them?  No, but the things they said were just out of this world. I got a photo with them.  All right with your photo, let's let the audience listen.  Jim got a photo with him. Enough with the photo.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show and safe to say that we're all very, very excited.  No offense, Mick, but these guys, you know, I grew up listening to their CDs. 
[00:00:30]  They're some of the first CDs. I mean, ahead of their time.  I'm trying to make believe I'm, you know, younger than I am.  I mean, the albums and the cassettes.  I can't imagine the big bamboo paper and a CD.  That'd be a little odd. Folded.  A little small.  Yeah, a little small, just regular size paper.  It's Cheech and Chong, everyone.  Hello.  Hey, please, sit down. 
[00:01:00]  Welcome to the show.  And I got to say, Tommy Chong did our show a few years ago, and we loved you.  We wanted to try to get you to do it on a semi-regular basis.  Yeah.  And you stop by and say hi every once in a while, but we haven't seen you since.  Well, this is semi-regular.  It was a jail.  There you are.  About that stint.  Yeah, that'll put a crimp in your social calendar.  Yeah.  How are you guys getting along?  It's everything's good?  It's back together?  You guys are happy?  He's a jerk, but it's okay.  I love him.  That must have sucked being in jail looking at the TV and there's Cheech working.  You know? 
[00:01:30]  Like, God damn it.  No, no.  One of the biggest laughs I got was when I found out Cheech was a love interest for, what was your name?  Tyne Daly.  Tyne Daly.  Oh, damn.  I still laugh at that.  When the hell is that?  Is that recent?  Must have been hilarious in jail.  Good point.  Who are you a love interest for?  Actually, he looked quite a bit like Tyne Daly.  He looked better. 
[00:02:00]  Jesus.  No, but I know Cheech has tasted in ladies, you know.  It ain't Tyne Daly.  And all of a sudden, he's a gardener and he's a love interest with Tyne Daly.  Oh, damn.  What was the name of the show?  Judgey Namy.  Judgey Namy.  Yeah, of course.  That was fun.  She was great to work with, man.  Tyne Daly?  Yeah, she was a real pro, you know.  Really, really good actor.  Could she take her teeth out?  I put it backwards.  God damn, I remember she was in like a Dirty Harry or something. 
[00:02:30]  I saw that the other day, man.  And you're like, damn, she's young and it still ain't working for me.  But she's working with all the sexy goddesses, you know.  Betty White.  Betty White.  Betty White.  Betty White was the first person I ever saw on TV when I was a kid.  She was on a local L.A. dance party thing called Make Believe Ballroom with Al Jarvis.  And she was 19 years old.  Wow.  And had the hugest rack.  Really?  Yeah, at 19.  She just graduated from Beverly Hills High. 
[00:03:00]  She was this like bubbly little Betty White.  She's a dirty woman.  She's like filthy.  She has anything about sex.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she's got a great sense of humor.  Worse than Cloris Leachman.  You guys have been watching Cloris.  Yeah, yeah.  She's crazy too, yeah.  Of course.  She's the only, you know, she's a female, but you don't want to look.  She shows you her teeth, you go, okay.  Yeah, I can put those away.  Yeah, put them away.  How old is she?  She's showing off her 82-year-old cleavage on that show.  You need to just fold them up and put them away. 
[00:03:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show, just now.  Previously on O&A.  So she goes, look, I'll give back all the money that was given to me by Social Security for my son.  Right.  And don't send me anymore.  And they went, no, it's too late.  So they cut her coverage off.  That's what bothers me right there is that there's no humanity.  No, no, it's all red tape.  It's the government and the insurance people.  They're all the same when it comes to that.  Trying to talk to one of these people, it's amazing how people have just lost their humanity.  You can't, there's no one. 
[00:04:00]  I pay my sister's health insurance and my nephew's.  You're an angel.  Yes, but I also hit her a lot.  It just pays for the cuts and bruises.  What's the problem with the computer?  You have to talk to me.  The X and Z doesn't work, so I have to copy and paste every time I use it.  Thanks for a Z.  I have to copy and paste.  Do you really?  Yes.  So, you've got to find an X somewhere.  Find my hand, copy and paste.  I've got to go to Word.  I've got to go to Word. 
[00:04:30]  Spell extra.  I spell extra wrong.  I pop it down.  I'm already at your computer.  You're an earl.  I once had it so bad, true story, I shit on a sidewalk in Manhattan.  Get the fuck in.  It was late at night.  I was trying to get home.  I knew I wasn't going to make it.  I looked around.  There was no one around.  And I swear to God, I fucking dropped chow, spread my fucking cheeks, and spread liquid 
[00:05:00]  diarrhea all over the sidewalk.  I've never admitted this before in my life.  But I swear to you, it went down.  Wow, what was this?  This was when we were off the air.  Jesus, you really took it hard.  They don't understand that they're fucking a major fucking problem for everybody around  All they do is fucking burden everybody in their lives around them.  And they want to be treated equal.  But they don't understand that everybody around them begins to hate their fucking guts.  And they isolate everybody. 
[00:05:30]  And they sit there and they feel victimized.  Why did everybody?  Yeah.  Shut up.  Shut your fucking mouth.  P.N. Anthony, live next. 
[00:06:00]  P.N. An Edwards, C.  P.N. Anthony, live next.  P.N. O'leader.  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I apologize for that little Twitter game I started around 930 at night.  Oh, shit.  What was it?  I think it almost trended. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, shit.  I think we were just short of trending last night.  I heard there were a couple of Twitter games and things going on.  I do a lot of Twitter games, almost one a day at this point.  And yesterday we were playing, what was it called officially?  What is Anthony doing?  What is Anthony doing now?  Oh, right.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Where the fuck is it?  And man, did this thing explode?  Yeah, I heard about that one.  You got a fucking beating.  Oh, right now, Anthony is was the hashtag. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So if you go to my Twitter, fuck it.  I'm promoting today.  OP radio.  And you pop in right now.  Anthony is in the search engine.  Yeah.  You'll see what everyone wrote the last eight hours.  It's it's ugly.  It's ugly.  I suggest you don't do that.  Don't do that.  No, no.  I suggest you don't do that.  It doesn't matter because I read enough tweets on my own personal Twitter because,  well, as you know, I went out last night with the lovely Taylor Vixen. 
[00:11:30]  She is Penthouse's pet of the year.  And we went out to dinner and then went out for some drinks and hung out in the wonderful  city of Manhattan, much like a romantic comedy.  And now she's dead.  Well, you can find her in a dumpster in the meat market.  Meat pack packing district.  Meat market.  Meat market.  Yeah.  Well, smooth.  See what I was thinking? 
[00:12:00]  We're just happy he's here.  I don't give a shit how smooth he is today.  Exactly.  Jesus Christ.  Slur all you want.  I don't give a fuck.  Right now, Anthony is buying an extra pregnancy test.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Right now, Anthony is thinking he should have dyed his pubes.  I don't have great pubes.  Shut up.  Right now, Anthony is balls deep in penthouse pussy.  It just goes on and on.  There's there could be a thousand of these.  I don't even know. 
[00:12:30]  I didn't count.  I got right now.  Anthony is pulling a girl from the closet for a quickie.  So, Ant, how's her turd cutter taste?  That's what I'm getting right now.  Anthony is packing sausage in the meat packing district.  Mm hmm.  Came in.  Mm hmm.  Uh.  Right now, Anthony.  I'm not even trying to pick out the better ones.  No, no.  Right now, Anthony is yelling at his whiskey dick.  Whiskey dick.  Shut up.  Oh, they fucking. 
[00:13:00]  Asshole.  They fucking killed you on Twitter, man.  There's a lot of, uh, uh, mistaken for her father tweets.  Uh, uh, grandfather here.  That's nice.  Um, and a lot of, uh, I look like a creep cause if you cut a few pictures were taken.  Uh huh.  Um, yeah.  Right now, Anthony is wondering what went wrong while choking his chicken in his hotel room.  You assholes.  Right now, Anthony is hoping there's a plunger in the hotel room.  That's a suggestion. 
[00:13:30]  You might've ate too much meat.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Uh, uh, it just goes on and on.  I mean, I mean, read them for yourself.  There's some fucking funny fucking listeners.  Yeah.  There are definitely, uh, plenty of nasty tweets, but you'll enjoy right now.  Anthony is, which we started.  We started late last night around nine, 10 o'clock.  That's late.  That's late.  As far as my standards go.  Yeah.  Trying to get up for this fucking God awful hour.  I was going to say God awful show. 
[00:14:00]  And I stopped myself cause I like the fucking radio show.  I just don't like getting up at five every fucking morning.  Socks.  Especially when you're busy or you're out, uh, until the wee little hours of the morning.  Yeah.  So how'd it go?  Are you going to walk us through this or what?  Uh, it went, uh, it went, uh, wonderfully.  Walk us through like, uh, nice.  What do I want to walk?  Well, you know, you had a day with a penthouse pet, Taylor Vixen.  She doesn't mind the publicity.  So let's fucking get into this a little bit.  As a matter of fact, she doesn't mind it. 
[00:14:30]  And she doesn't mind to the fact that on nine o'clock, I think she could be making an appearance  right here in this very studio.  Oh, nice.  Come in and, uh, she's still alive and hang out.  Yeah, exactly.  She wants to.  That's good.  She wants her family to know she's still alive.  What the fuck did you guys do last night?  Were you like, can you make sure you come in here at nine?  So I have an alibi.  There was a lot of, uh, a lot of meat eating.  Well, I know you're good.  You're jumping way ahead.  After the show yesterday, you went to your hotel.  Yeah.  And, and crashed to get ready for the big date. 
[00:15:00]  I crashed out.  Um, I watched a movie first though.  What movie?  Uh, the road, that post apocalyptic, uh, with Vigo and, uh, and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Now that I read the fucking book.  You did.  It was, uh, named one of the best books of, uh, the last 10, 20 years, something like  that.  Pretty cool.  So I read it.  The book is pretty good.  I dig any post apocalyptic movie.  Michael Williams is in that, right?  Omar?  I don't know.  The father and son.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, I didn't.  I saw that in the book, the bookstore.  I didn't read it.  Books.  What the fuck are you talking about?  I said I saw a movie.  Well, supposedly Omar's in it.  Yeah.  Michael K. Williams.  Yes.  Michael K. Williams.  Now I read the book.  The book was amazing.  The movie came out and no one.  And you probably won't like the movie because if you liked the book.  But no one watched the movie.  It didn't get much of a buzz when it came out.  Everybody was busy watching Precious and fucking.  Nah, I think it came out before Precious.  Anyway.  Cause it was on the, um, new releases kind of a thing.  So they snuck this movie by everyone.  I'm thinking cause it didn't really get a big marketing splash. 
[00:16:00]  And V goes good.  Was it good?  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I liked that.  All right.  Then, uh, crashed out for a long time.  Yeah.  I figured this was going to be, uh, one of these.  I really had to time my sleep very well.  Right.  Uh, cause I didn't want to be drowsy, uh, for the night.  So I fell asleep until probably six 30.  How can you do that?  Uh, I'm tired.  Yeah, but you can, you can turn your sleep on and off like that.  Yeah.  I don't understand.  I love it.  I was sleepy. 
[00:16:30]  There's times just like you.  I go home.  Like, all right, I got a big night.  If I could sleep three or four hours during the day or four, then I don't have to worry  about, you know, staying out a little later.  Yeah.  And then I just lay there in bed like, okay, I'm ready to sleep.  I'll sleep for six fucking hours.  No problem.  That was my night's sleep.  Okay.  I planned on having a night's sleep, uh, in the afternoon and then napping, uh, for an  hour or two before I have to come in here.  Right.  Which is exactly what I did.  Right.  Uh, woke up, uh, got ready, uh, you know, but a little you do in front of the mirror. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you have a little Frank Sinatra playing?  Oh, of course, you know, moved.  Get a little Frank brush.  You're in midtown Manhattan.  Put on a little cologne, you know what?  No.  Uh, just getting ready.  What did you wear?  He wore a tux.  Uh, no, no, I have.  Why did you wear a tux?  I figured a tux was appropriate for a night out.  For a meat packing night.  We're calling it Anthony's Meat Packing Night.  My meat packing evening. 
[00:17:30]  You started with eating lots of meat and ended in the meat packing.  I went to the meat packing.  Enough about the meat.  I love the meat.  Yeah, no, I wore very nice clothes.  Very nice button down and stuff.  No, I don't get nervous anymore.  Nerves are for rookies many years ago.  I used to get nervous when I was a kid.  I'd have anxiety attacks.  Oh, look at the nice picture right there.  That is what people are saying is the creepiest picture they ever saw in their lives. 
[00:18:00]  Why are you making a face like, get the fuck off me?  She's smiling.  Shut up.  Yes, she is.  And her hands are on mine.  Shut up.  She's trying to make her neck disappear.  Don't be an ass.  She's smiling.  She's trying to make her neck disappear.  She's having fun, and I'm not an asperatum biting her neck, which is what someone said.  You're trying to make her neck disappear.  No.  I mean, she is.  Anthony and fucking Langella.  Right.  What a creep.  You're an asshole. 
[00:18:30]  God, you're in love after five minutes.  No, we were hanging and having fun.  Why don't you play hard to get a little bit?  What?  No, look at that cocktails.  It's not bad to play hard to get.  We got cocktails.  That should be cocktails.  It's not.  I'm not being a creep.  We're having fun.  Jesus.  Did you tell the restaurant to turn down the lights so you could take a picture together?  No, it was a very dimly lit restaurant.  There's no lights on.  And it's very dimly lit.  And the iPhone, not known for its dark photography. 
[00:19:00]  New.  Blackberry, way better.  I'm telling you.  There's no flash, so what can I say?  But, no, a lot of people dubbing that the creepiest picture they've ever seen.  It's nice to see a father and daughter out for the evening as a lot of those came in.  Another one, Anthony's biting her neck to give her immortality.  Just plenty of vampire and old pictures.  It has the same vibe as fucking Eric Roberts and his girlfriend in Star 80. 
[00:19:30]  Wow!  Nice.  All right, but you're jumping ahead, so you leave the hotel.  Left the hotel.  By the way, because we've got to get some other material in.  You know the other joint we used to stay at?  Someone fucking jumped from the roof.  The Parker?  The Parker Meridian.  Really?  That's like the second one since we...  Someone jumped from the roof as the Angels were boarding their bus to go play the Yankees last night.  The Angels were staying there? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Everybody stays there.  That's a great hotel for like...  Yeah, I know.  I stayed there once when Obama was there.  If you want to see real celebrities, just hang outside the park and Rudy on any given day.  They all stay there.  Wow.  Fucking will blow up their spot a little bit today.  They never gave me the suite like they gave you the fucking suite.  Oh, they gave me the presidential suite once.  The guys...  Great.  Just knowing you're fucking laying in the bed that...  Like, you know, president's bed.  I think they bring...  I think he brings his own bed.  You think they bring...  Why would he bring his own bed?  Why would he want to sleep on bed bugs?  That would be exhausting. 
[00:20:30]  Well, he doesn't carry it.  His bed's a lot nicer than their bed.  He has to carry his own bed into every hotel.  I bet they...  Bang.  I hope, you know, it wasn't Obama's because...  And you're a goddamn racist because you stopped staying at that hotel after you found out Obama  was in the same room as you were.  That was probably the last time I stayed there when I found out Obama stayed there.  I said, I shall not patronize you.  We'll get back to your story.  But this is a huge one today.  So the Angels are in town.  They're playing the Yankees.  And they say a bunch of the guys were across the street at a coffee shop.  That would be the Starbucks that's right there.  Oh, right. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  We know this fucking area, like the back of our hand.  Yeah.  So they're in Starbucks, and one of the Angels actually sees the body hit the sidewalk.  Did that put a damper on his performance for the evening?  I know the Angels lost.  No, I bet all of a sudden the guy goes, hey, here's one more Angel getting made.  Oh, Chip.  So, yeah, someone committed suicide yesterday morning around 8 a.m.  Wow, from the roof.  That's a tall building, too.  From the fucking roof.  The guy jumped.  They got a pool up there. 
[00:21:30]  Maybe he was cleaning the gutters.  And maybe he was jumping into the pool.  Jumped.  We were just talking about how suicides seem to be on the rise a couple days ago.  People a little upset with the economy.  And an 18-year-old jumped off the GWB yesterday as well.  Guy jumped off the, uh, a little rate.  Leaving a note in his car.  A little suicide note as he left his car in the middle of the fucking bridge.  Isn't that great?  Blocking traffic.  Messing up everyone else's desk.  Asshole.  Just because you have decided that your life sucks.  Why would you make it worse for everybody else by leaving your car there?  Another guy, I know, got out of his car and jumped out of the Midtown Tunnel. 
[00:22:00]  Sprained his ankle.  Yeah.  All right.  If you're going to jump off the fucking bridge, do us all a favor.  You could easily walk to the middle of the bridge.  I'd bike across that stupid bridge a lot.  It's very easy.  It doesn't matter.  Why don't you give it a little effort?  Huh?  They'll still rope it off a crime tape and fuck the whole thing up.  Wow.  The crime's in the fucking water.  Yeah.  But, you know, they'll go where he jumped and have to rope off like 18 feet behind where  he jumped, which takes up two fucking lanes.  Just jump in the river. 
[00:22:30]  All right.  So you got the Angels looking at that fucking suicide yesterday.  And then they lost to the end.  Was it somebody that is a key player?  Yeah, Jared Weaver.  Was he a little distressed at bat?  No, he's a pitcher.  Oh, he's a pitcher.  Okay.  But he said he wouldn't talk about it.  Wow.  The article that I read said that he saw the guy splat on the ground.  Whoa, he's fucked for the season.  And then, like, the two Angels, they kind of saw the body.  He saw it hit, and then the other guy saw the body laying there. 
[00:23:00]  Two Angels, right, Travis?  Yeah.  Was it a couple?  Yeah.  Before the police got there.  Wow.  Yeah, just looking at the fucking pizza on the sidewalk.  Yeah, enough of jumping from these fucking buildings, man.  You're going to take one of us out.  That's what Jimmy was saying yesterday about crazy people and what they did.  It's just such a selfish thing to do.  Now you're fucking up other people's fucking lives because it's all about you.  Do you know some guy jumped off the Empire Staple?  There's a young guy who's going to jump off the GW.  Do they ever make it to the ground?  Don't they usually get blown into a ledge?  The Empire Staple link starts off at the top very slim, and then has big ledges that come out. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, but that'll kill you.  Oh, yeah, it'll kill you, but it's not like you're going to hit the sidewalk.  Well, that's everyone's goal, to be the first guy to hit the sidewalk.  Yeah, good luck.  I'm too busy throwing fucking pennies off the top.  I love winging pennies off of there.  I'm fucking a big fan of that.  Just hoping it goes through someone's head.  Absolutely.  Something savage.  You know, you watch Mythbusters and realize it doesn't work.  It works.  Yeah?  Yeah, it works.  People will just go like, ow.  It works.  They'll just go, ow, fuck.  I saw that Mythbuster, by the way. 
[00:24:00]  I know it doesn't work.  They say it'll go, yeah, because the rumor was it would go right through your head and  come out like your taint.  Right.  That's what they say, but apparently, no, not so much.  Here's a quote.  Thanks, Danny.  Weaver actually saw him land, Palmer said.  As a believer in Christ, you have to sit there and pray for the man.  You don't even know him, but you think about what he might have been going through, and  you're hoping that his family or whoever he has can somehow fathom what he did.  As far as myself, it was an eye-awakening scene.  Even if I had a bad day on the mound, it's nothing compared to what he just did. 
[00:24:30]  Trying to compare a bad day on the mound to jumping off of a fucking roof in Manhattan  and splatting on a sidewalk.  Relax.  Walking ten guys in one fucking game.  Yeah, yeah.  One fucking games.  Not the same thing as your family not able to identify you until the fucking dentist shows up.  I like the skipper coming out and taking your ball, and then you jump from fucking 40 stories up.  All right, anyway, so that's the old hotel.  So, all right, so you got ready for the date with Taylor Vixen, Penthouse Pet of the Year? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And then what?  Where are we?  Well, we're hanging out.  What did you pick her up?  We went.  You meet her there?  Met her at the restaurant.  Okay.  Met her at the restaurant.  What was she wearing?  A very nice little black dress number.  A hazmat suit.  Yes, I'm known as a secretor.  She's wearing a very nice black number with her breasts nice and pushed up. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, together.  She was showing off the goods, huh?  Those nice big breasts and the diamond and gold penthouse key dangling in her cleavage.  Very lovely.  And she saw me walk in.  I went up to the receptionist and whatever they're called, hostess.  And that's my reservation.  And I heard, Anthony.  And I turned around, and there she was.  Big arms opened up.  Comes for the big hug and kiss and everything. 
[00:26:00]  Like, oh.  What are you thinking, Jimmy?  Jimmy's got something.  No, no, no.  I love this one.  I love Anthony.  Because I know when Anthony's in those modes, he talks like baby boy Anthony.  He gets very sweet.  And he probably went, hi.  And was very cute.  Anthony was probably very cute last night.  How are you?  You are an asshole.  That and booze.  Well, it's because he's all sweet at first.  Like, oh, don't you look pretty?  And then he fucking fast forward, ate drinks. 
[00:26:30]  I was fucking spooked.  I was driving like motherfuckers.  Doesn't take that many drinks.  It's true.  It's like, excuse me, waiter.  That's after the first ginger ale.  When the Mexican comes with the water.  Surprise, he didn't swim over here.  Cheers.  Coincidence, the wet brag brings the water.  Wet brag?  Yeah, it's a wet brag.  Really?  That's all right. 
[00:27:00]  That's all right.  You dated a fucking pet of the year.  Whatever you say, it's fine.  So you got a big hug.  She brought a friend, right?  That was the rumor going around Twitter yesterday.  A girl did show up later on.  Was she a pig?  No, no, no.  Very, very hot.  Was she a penthouse?  Like, throwaway?  No, I don't think she was a throwaway.  I think it's like, I think she was a little nervous.  Yeah.  You know, hey, here's some fucking dopey radio asshole.  You're a selfish guy. 
[00:27:30]  I don't want him raping me.  You're a real selfish guy, man.  That's right.  You could have brought one of your friends.  Absolutely.  She's bringing a friend.  You bring a friend.  I'm not going to bring a friend.  A fucking cock blocker.  I'm not bringing a cock blocker.  You were hoping for the...  Yeah.  For the menage?  Oh, yeah.  Well, who wouldn't?  I would have just sat at the end of the table and not said anything until the friend showed up.  I would have been very quiet.  I would have said nothing on your date.  Could have helped the brother out.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not cheating if it's for the radio.  That's true.  That's right.  So how long were you together before the friend... 
[00:28:00]  Like, what happened?  You sat down and you started talking?  Yeah, sat down, started talking.  Wait, Ant, the phone call's coming in.  Are they?  Yeah.  I don't want to miss any of these fine fucking phone calls today.  Jack in South Carolina.  Jack.  Hey, did you sweet talk?  I like you with a blackjack dealer.  Pussy, please.  No, I didn't say pussy, please.  Right off the bat.  Pussy, please.  And it was a deal where she was drinking and didn't want to drive.  Wow, what's her poison?  Didn't want to drive. 
[00:28:30]  What goes with Vicodin?  No, there was a...  It was some kind of a rum thingy.  Let it be known.  I don't know what television fucking does in her...  Rum thingy.  ...in her private life.  A little joke for the radio.  What was it?  I didn't detect any drug use.  That's good.  Which was good, but it was some responsible drinking.  Vodka, you said?  No, rum.  Oh, rum, you said.  I'm sorry.  Some rum drink that was going on at the Brazilian joint, Brazilian meat joint. 
[00:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  And we had some...  Yeah, we had a lot of meat.  I told you, man.  That's a brave move.  I know that's where she wanted to go, but fucking taking a first date to a meat joint like the Brazilian place is insane.  Yeah.  Because you can't say no.  As much as you're trying to control your...  Oh, I would say no a lot.  But even when you say no a lot, you're still eating two pounds of meat by the end of your meal, right?  Until deliciousness came by, and then you've got to say yes.  Even though you were trying to be cool and not eat a lot, how much meat do you end up eating there? 
[00:29:30]  Uh, be honest.  Yeah, probably a nice plate full of meat.  Right.  And that's with you trying to say no.  Well, I was saying no to probably a good 50% of the people that came by with their meat on a steak.  Did you have the paddles?  Paddles.  The red and green paddles?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You put it up, the color, after you're done with the salad bar thingy, and you flip it, and here come the meat.  How great was the salad bar?  It was good.  You could go there just sushi.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not just salad. 
[00:30:00]  They have pretty much anything you could imagine.  Sushi appetizer?  That by the time you sit down with your salad, you don't even need the meat anymore.  No, and the guy comes over and goes, uh, now you have the salad bar, but take it easy, take it easy.  Like, oh, okay, well, this guy knows something, uh, take it easy at the salad bar.  Because then the cavalcade of meat comes.  Yep.  And, uh, wow.  Really good, though.  But it's a little stressful at first, because they give you tongs.  Mm-hmm.  And as they're slicing the meat off, you gotta grab it with the tongs.  Oh, yeah.  And hold it as it comes down on the plate and grab it. 
[00:30:30]  And I was like, all I kept thinking is I was gonna drop my meat.  Name all the meats that came by.  Oh.  If you can remember.  God, there's a big fucking, like, sirloin.  Mm-hmm.  And then there's the, um...  Sausage.  Yes.  They bring sausage.  They bring some sausage.  You gotcha sausage.  Sausage.  Put in some sugar.  A little wine.  Yeah, it was, uh, uh, that, the, um, uh, prime rib.  Yep.  On there.  And all done, like, uh, you know, well done.  Or, uh, you know, well, medium, medium rare. 
[00:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  That.  And they'd slice off the piece you want.  Just wonderful.  Yeah.  And, uh, I had to keep turning them down.  Nothing with bacon on it.  I didn't want, you know, the bacon-wrapped stuff.  I just was having, uh, a lot of the lean stuff.  A little pork loin would come by.  Oh, yeah.  How about that?  A little short rib?  Oh, yeah.  A little short rib?  Bam.  You got your short rib.  I got to, I got to, I got to brag.  You know Quinn, my brother.  Oh, yeah.  Used to work on Wall Street.  Doesn't have to anymore.  He's raising kids and, I don't know what, fucking playing golf, whatever. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  He went there with us, me and my cousins and, and Quinn Wynn and a couple uncles.  He fucking never turned his paddle red.  Are you kidding?  Now, you've sat there.  Yeah.  You realize how, how that's almost impossible, right?  You have to.  You get to a point.  He never fucking turned his paddle to red.  And ate everything.  And I made sure I did not, um, I did not keep eating to the point of, oh my God, I'm so  full.  So I turned it over. 
[00:32:00]  That's impossible.  Well before I was full.  That's really impossible.  No, because.  You go there to gorge.  You're wrong.  No.  No, not in that situation.  You see?  I didn't want to be in that situation.  You guys should have went to a little sushi joint.  Had a little sushi.  She wanted to go there.  She wanted meat.  I'm taking her for meat.  She wanted meat.  I'm slipping her some meat.  She was taking her to the Carnegie Deli.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get her some liverwurst and head cheese.  Watch her vomit.  Go Dutch. 
[00:32:30]  Fuck it.  Get a chiseler.  Chiseler.  Court complained about the price of everything.  Everything that she orders.  Asked the way to, how much is that going to run me?  She actually asked it when the check came.  Oh, you want to split that?  I'm like, no.  Okay, Ralph.  You should have taken out your reading glasses and a little calculator.  And calculate how much she owes right in front of her.  It's a tip calculator.  Right.  No.  An old fucking Jewish woman with her friends. 
[00:33:00]  Sit there.  Exactly.  12% or something.  There's nothing better than watching a bunch of old Jewish women fucking figure out how  much they owe on a lunch tab.  Oh, my God.  We had a good dinner and then decided it was time to hit the meatpacking district.  That was it for dinner?  For a little nightlife.  Well, it's dinner.  What the fuck do you want?  Are you there?  You're slicing.  You're eating meat.  We're talking.  We're getting to know each other.  I don't want to miss anything here.  Are we moving on from the meat trade? 
[00:33:30]  How long were you there for?  It was a getting to know each other thing.  Probably two and a half hours.  Oh, it's a while.  It's all about 11.  A long time.  What time did the friend show up?  There was a lot of talking.  I don't even remember.  She showed up to the restaurant.  Yeah.  I don't remember, though.  Did you have to buy her meat, too?  Oh, yeah.  I had to buy a little meat.  You had to buy her meat.  So where did the girl...  Wait.  I know what to ask.  Because they were there two and a half hours.  Did you get a little closer?  Do you mean physically or do you mean psychologically and spiritually? 
[00:34:00]  Well, whatever you want to tell us there.  Well, we got to know each other a lot better.  You know, real know each other.  She actually...  Not just, you know, what's on your penthouse thing.  We talked about black people a lot.  Does she like them or hate them?  I'm not going to say anything about that wonderful, sweet girl.  But we did talk race.  We've had a lot of bimbos in here.  And Taylor Vixen seemed like, you know, seemed a lot cooler than most. 
[00:34:30]  She seems like she could carry on a conversation.  She's a very cool girl.  And it's not one of those...  We were talking about her likes and dislikes from the penthouse page,  which are completely ridiculous and, you know, written and things like that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You figure that's all made up.  And she's from Texas, so talked about her, you know, her life in Texas and California.  Just getting to know...  It's the getting to know each other thing.  Did you figure out who touched her as a child?  I really couldn't figure that out. 
[00:35:00]  It could have been one of many people.  Really?  But I didn't really care.  I just wanted to be the last in the line so far.  Someone touched her.  I wanted to be the last horrific touching experience.  She was in full bloom by the age of eight.  Someone touched her in her family.  Jesus Christ.  No, apparently she has a good relationship with her family.  That's good.  Did you peck her on the cheek or anything at the meat joint?  No, I didn't think that would be a good move. 
[00:35:30]  Okay.  You know, I like the let's kind of really get to know and get some booze in you phase of the whole thing.  So after that, it was hitting the meatpacking district.  We went to the beer garden.  Jesus, didn't you have enough meat?  Well, there was no meat where we went.  It was the beer garden.  I would have been so embarrassed if we bumped into each other in the meatpacking district. 
[00:36:00]  If you saw me and Mike, hi.  Hi, I'm with Jimmy tonight.  Yeah, you see me and somebody 6'8 with a blonde wig scraping the inside of my beamer.  What are you doing?  Fred needed a lift home.  That is awkward.  I'll be right back, Daddy.  I have to go tuck again.  I don't know what you mean.  Yeah, what do you mean?  Madam.  Madam.  Giant shoulders.  Get out, madam.  So we're in the meatpacking district.  What street is that?  I forgot the street, but it's called the Beer Garden. 
[00:36:30]  It's a wonderful outdoor bar.  Okay.  It's a bunch of tables.  They have ping pong.  They've got everything going on there.  And it's all heated.  It's outdoor, but they've got these heaters hung up there, so the whole goddamn place is heated.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  And it's underneath that elevated train line that they made the park on top of now.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's right underneath that.  Wow.  Yeah.  So it was nice.  We hung out there.  The bartender, very nice guy, made wonderful martinis. 
[00:37:00]  Jesus.  Lemon drop martinis.  You and the two girls.  Some beers.  Yeah.  Nice.  And hung out, a little more chatting.  It got a little more, the conversation got a little more intimate and sexual in nature.  Were any guys being cock blockers or no?  No.  Some people were looking over.  Yeah.  Like, what is that creep doing with that very attractive girl kind of look?  She looked good.  But, uh, yeah, she looked really good.  Yeah, yeah.  She, uh, she did. 
[00:37:30]  She looked really good.  So, uh, you know.  She's got a very, like, pretty face and everything, you know?  You got me.  So, you know, you guys fucking peering over.  Get the fuck out of here.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Leave.  Smack you.  No, it was fine.  And, uh, you know, a lot of chatting, a lot of chit-chat going on.  And, uh, drinking.  Did you get very, uh, it just...  Yeah?  Problem?  I need Jimmy with...  I need Jimmy on this one.  Okay.  Because it reminds me of one of Jimmy's bits that makes me laugh every fucking time he 
[00:38:00]  does the bit on stage.  I'll just say this.  Did you get very possessive?  No, no, no, no.  No.  What is that?  What did you do?  I don't know.  Possessive?  Oh, if the girl's cell phone rings?  Right.  Oh, if you're on a first date and her phone rings, look at her.  You go, who the fuck is that?  You barely know it, but you say it.  That'd be funny as fuck.  Yeah, you look right at the phone.  Who the fuck is that?  Go ahead.  Pick it up.  Yeah.  Great.  Will you answer it for her?  Who is this?  She's with me now. 
[00:38:30]  She's with me now.  You've only known her an hour.  What are you doing?  So you weren't possessive when the guys were looking over?  No, no.  Why are you looking at my girlfriend?  And there was a couple of calls or texts that were going on, but I was getting them too  because people wanted to know what the fuck is going on.  And what's her name from Penthouse that brings the girls?  Lainey?  Lainey.  Yeah, I believe Lainey called at one point.  I think they were just making sure she was okay.  Oh, really?  They didn't want her murdered.  People hear stories, you know? 
[00:39:00]  Sure.  They hear stories about me and think, you know, it's going to be an awful experience or something.  But no, it was very nice.  Got a little bit more intimate, you said?  Yeah, yeah.  Just the conversation got a little more intimate.  It was very nice.  And we hung out at the bar just chit-chatting.  Found out she is coming back in June because she's leaving. 
[00:39:30]  She lives in L.A.  This is a problem.  Oh, I'll be there Sunday.  Oh, really?  Maybe I could just-  What the fuck do you-  What do you mean?  Just saying I'll be out there-  You stay away!  Maybe I can gather info and intel for you.  A little intel?  Check up on her for you.  So why don't you take a trip out to L.A. and go see her?  Before June-  Because she's Woody Allen.  I could do that. 
[00:40:00]  What kind of a boyfriend are you?  I could do that.  Boyfriend, what?  Oh, my God.  No, I could do that.  Did she even say maybe you could come and see me in L.A.?  Yeah, that's fine.  Because-  She said that?  Yes.  She meant Louisiana.  Yeah, I'm flying to L.A.  What the fuck is this?  But in June, already planning, compound.  She's coming to the compound?  Yep.  For what?  Hang out.  A little poolage.  Wow. 
[00:40:30]  Yes.  Wow.  Because who wouldn't love to see her relaxing by the pool in her bikini?  Dude, you're going to become the new Hugh Hefner, man.  It starts with one.  That's what the whole place is about.  And then you have her bring in the other ones.  That's what it's all about.  Next thing you know, you're like the penthouse Hugh Hefner.  Yes.  And you know penthouse is a little dirtier than Playboy.  That's my goal.  Right now you're Hugh Downs.  My goal is to have a skimmer that looks like it's had shaving cream squirted into it. 
[00:41:00]  And penthouse shows a little dirt in their fucking picture.  They certainly do.  They used to.  Not anymore.  They got really hardcore.  Yeah, they don't have the piss and the blowjobs.  They're trying to tone it down a little bit.  Yeah, I think they toned it down a little bit.  Wait, so what happened?  We skipped ahead.  So you're at the beer garden.  It was getting sexier.  And we're making, because I know she's got to go, you know, on Thursday, that I'm kind  of making plans for the next time.  Right.  So that's where I was going with the next time she said she insisted she take me out to 
[00:41:30]  dinner and we'll go back to the compound and hang out when she comes back.  But until then, who knows?  I might take a little trip out to the coast.  Why not, right?  Absolutely.  You know, I should go out there and just see what the fuck.  Absolutely you should.  So obviously you caught, like, a little connection with her? 
[00:42:00]  I think there was something there.  There was some fun and, you know, a little, I'm not sure, a little connection.  She's coming in a little later.  So we'll, you know, I'll, you know, I'll see what the, how the overnight ratings were.  Fuck, we should have.  Let me give the, let me get the overnight.  We should have some kind of fucking, uh, we should have questions.  Don't fuck me up.  We should have questions to see how, how well she was listening.  No.  I didn't do, here's what I do though. 
[00:42:30]  Here's what I do.  And I've learned this since I was a kid with, with girls.  You don't sit there and babble about yourself.  You talk, you have conversation, but you, you entice them to talk about themselves.  And comment on what they're saying.  Because girls will get very bored if you just sit there and talk about yourself.  If you have a common interest or a commonality in, uh, where you've lived, things like that.  Then you could throw your own shit in there.  But for the most part, don't just sit there and give these fucking diatribes about your life and fucking bullshit like that. 
[00:43:00]  Because then it bores the chick.  If you're listening to her, and what she's saying, that works a lot better.  So this is a pointer for all the guys that are going to be going out on a date with a penthouse pet of the year.  Exactly.  Any of you tin knockers out there.  That get an opportunity to date a penthouse pet of the year.  Right.  Listen to Anthony's advice.  Do you know yesterday, as a matter of fact, when we sat in this very studio yesterday for the show,  I looked out that very window and saw a guy from a company called PJ Mechanical. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, sure.  An air conditioning and heating company.  They were changing filters in here yesterday.  Don't think it went unnoticed by me.  I sat there and looked at this poor bastard with his head poked above the acoustic tile ceiling,  replacing filters in air conditioning units.  Yuck.  As I was sitting here thinking, I did that.  Mm-hmm.  And now I'm going out tonight with a penthouse pet of the year.  See, anything's possible.  It really is. 
[00:44:00]  Anything's possible.  Fairytales can come true.  It can happen to you.  I think it's really funny that you're acting like this is a story of inspiration to be lauded  as one of a tale of heartbreak and sorrow and victory.  Yes, Jimmy.  It's a tale of overcoming the obstacles.  Thank you.  Do brilliant and funny voices and be vitriolic in your humor and people will like you.  Thank you.  You're absolutely right.  Is this what she was wearing last night? 
[00:44:30]  Let me see.  Let me see that picture.  Uh, no, it was very similar, though.  And she had, like, a little thing because it was a little chilly last night.  Jesus.  So she had a little on-the-shoulder thingy going on.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, Taylor Vixen on Twitter.  Uh, yeah.  Um, so she, and we were laughing our asses off at the tweets that were coming in, by the  way.  Uh, sitting there, reading some of the tweets and just laughing and laughing about it.  It was good.  God, here's, uh, somebody here saying, gotta love Jimmy to bring Ant back to Earth. 
[00:45:00]  No, I'm happy for Anthony, man.  I would, I would never cock-block Anthony.  No, I, I never would even suggest that you would do that.  You know what would be funny, though?  Jimmy's a team player.  Like, uh, if you just brought up really serious things, like you got, like, a little too drunk.  Like, there's a story in the paper about Father Charged and infant shaking death.  And if you were just like, how the fuck does anybody shake a baby to death?  Shake a poor little thing.  Do you know what the thing was probably thinking right when it was being shookethed to death? 
[00:45:30]  Jesus.  And she's just looking like, okay, get me the fuck out of here.  So when did you guys leave the beer garden?  Uh, left the beer garden, it was probably, oh, close to 2.30.  They closed the outside beer garden, um, like at midnight, because I guess there's an ordinance  and they don't want people fucking yelling and waking people up that live 18 blocks away. 
[00:46:00]  Well, it's time for the trannies to go to bed.  Exactly.  That's basically what you're saying.  Uh, so we, we, we took it inside to the inside bar, grabbed a table and, uh, and had a few  more cocktails in there till about 2.30 in the morning.  How the fuck do you do it?  Are you, are you drunk now?  No, no.  As a matter of fact, I, uh, I was very.  But you drank from, what, seven, eight o'clock all the way to 2.30 in the morning?  No, no, uh, from nine.  I started drinking at nine until about 2.30, but I only had beer. 
[00:46:30]  I didn't drink anything.  I didn't have any shots.  If I only had beer from nine at 2.30, uh, I'd still be drunk.  Yeah.  You're not drunk?  Nah.  I've been in here.  You don't seem drunk.  I've been in here drunk from the night before and this ain't it.  Yeah, you're fine.  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  Tell us something we don't know.  Jesus.  Well, some nights.  Uh, so.  You know, I stopped, uh, unless, you know, a special occasion, but I did stop the during  the week drinking unless I was doing something like this.  This is acceptable.  If you were booting heroin, this is acceptable. 
[00:47:00]  You're out with her.  If she's like, look, I want to score a little fucking coke and heat it up and smoke it.  Even Jimmy understands this one.  No, since I've started.  Even Jimmy understands this one.  Since I've started my workout regimen.  He's not going to question you on this one.  I have stopped the during the week drinking.  Right.  Unless there's a Tuesday date with a penthouse pet of the year.  Then I'm going to, you know.  All right.  I'm not going to sit there and teetotal.  You don't have to explain to us.  So 2.30, you leave the beer garden. 
[00:47:30]  2.30.  We want to know how this whole thing ended.  Leave the beer garden.  It's back to the original restaurant where the parking garage was.  Okay.  And, um.  Where the transportation was.  Yes, the transportation.  There was the drop-off and a nice, you know, little take-it-easy.  Nice little safe home kind of thing.  A nice little take-it-easy?  Nice little.  Does that mean she got on her knees? 
[00:48:00]  What's a.  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.  It was on her knees in the street on 49th Street.  Isn't that what a take-it-easy is?  No, that's a how-do-you-do.  Oh, I'm confused.  I'm sorry.  How-do-you-do.  I thought that was.  That's what you meant by the take-it-easy.  No, it was a nice, you know, kind of a take-care, I'll see you tomorrow.  Did you desperately grope her?  Yes, I actually did desperately grope her.  Like, please don't leave.  By the parking garage.  It's like fucking Cinderella.  I wanted to drag her off. 
[00:48:30]  You know, at any moment, this dream is coming to an end, so you desperately groped her.  No, this was just.  Did you desperately grope a penthouse pet of the year?  No, this was just a, you know, a nice little step-through-the-door kind of a thing.  And how do you do?  Did you rub chest together a little bit?  There was a little bit of bodily contact.  I'll say that.  I don't want to be a kiss-and-tell graphic guy here on the radio.  No, but we'll see.  We'll see how. 
[00:49:00]  Between the lines.  We'll see what she wants to say when she comes in, because.  Did you kiss her goodnight?  Yeah.  And it was outdoors?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  So somewhere around the parking garage, a little groping happened.  Well, you want to look at security cameras from the area?  Why not?  You want to see if there's a security camera?  Hey, we know people.  Get your make-and-mike on it.  49th Street fucking parking garage.  Get your make-and-mike on it.  Did you, like, aimlessly shuffle uncomfortably towards her hotel until she indicated that 
[00:49:30]  you were not coming upstairs?  No!  Just kind of like, I'm kicking the can, walk like your little legs kicking out slowly.  That was the problem, because she had to go back to Jersey, because she's got shit to  do today, and then she's dropping in here.  But she had to go back to Jersey.  What does she have to do in Jersey?  She's a penthouse pet of the year.  I'm not going to.  She should live in the Big Apple.  Yeah, man.  There's shit happening in the Big Apple.  It's the Big Apple.  I'm not going to intrude with that kind of question or anything, but, you know, I accept  it.  It was a great, fun night, and, you know. 
[00:50:00]  So there's no reason to smell your fingers this morning?  Smells like sausage.  Have you had your first meat shit yet?  No, I haven't taken a meat shit.  Oh, my God.  Wait till that fucking decides to show its ugly head.  Yeah?  Oh!  But I was being good.  I was like, I wasn't eating, like, fucking tons of it.  I know.  I didn't want to fuck up, you know.  I had a good cholesterol count.  I didn't want to fuck it up.  Well, you know, Bill in Boston. 
[00:50:30]  Hello, Bill!  Bill, go ahead.  He's on to something here.  Go ahead, Bill.  Anthony, you're already my hero, but you've already got one Playboy chick.  Now, this is a potential penthouse chick.  We need you to get a hustler chick, and you go into the fucking Hall of Fame, my friend.  Yeah, I want a swank also.  You might.  Yeah, and a biggums.  Yeah, no, I don't want a biggums.  Yeah, we want...  No, I don't want a biggums.  And over 50, yes.  And he's already had Puerto Rican inches, right? 
[00:51:00]  We need one from the biggums magazine.  Yeah.  And the over 50.  Yeah, Bill, right on.  Well, she was in Hustler.  She was also in Hustler.  Wow.  She was a cover girl of Hustler, but I think you need separate girls from each magazine  to do the trifecta.  Can I tell you about the penthouse girl I fucked?  Honcho.  I also got a gentleman from Honcho, which is wonderful.  Uncut.  Docking.  It's wonderful.  You fucked who? 
[00:51:30]  No, I said I would tell you about the penthouse girl I fucked.  Oh, no.  There's a reason for that.  It's through happiness.  Oh, Jimmy.  It never happened.  Never happened.  Very jealous.  I fucked a girl from Highlights once.  Let's say hi to Ball Washer.  I fucked Goofus.  Gallant watched.  Gallant just wept.  I made him tongue my balls at knife point.  While Goofus sucked my asshole.  Goofus.  Goofus.  Goofus is a goer. 
[00:52:00]  Goofus will lay your head back over the bed and fuck your throat.  Of course he will.  While Gallant chides him.  Gallant makes sure he swallows every drop.  Goofus gets it all over his face.  Goofus makes a cum mess.  Ball washer.  What up?  Ball washer.  Anthony, did you get to stick it in her fart box?  No.  Unfortunately, I did not get to stick it, as you say, in her fart box.  Did you at least get to see her turd cutter?  Um, uh, well, in pictures.  Well, we've all done that. 
[00:52:30]  I know.  We've all done that.  Yeah.  But, you know, what, oh, thank you, Danny.  Did you get to see where the poo comes out?  Uh, no, not, not live.  There we go.  There's, aw, look.  You should have that picture on your iPhone while you're eating meat.  I should have, I should have went to show her a picture.  And just go.  And have that as my fucking, like, wall of paper.  You know, I like this picture of you the best.  Her asshole picture.  So, wait, what did she have on last night?  I want to see a picture of what she had on last night.  Uh, aren't there pictures, um.  Let's say hi to Sean in Georgia.  I couldn't find any. 
[00:53:00]  Let me see if I got any on my telephono.  Sean, Georgia, what's up?  Hello, Sean.  Hey, I thought you said last week that you could only drink during the week if it was sunny outside.  Now you can also drink if there's a date?  Uh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, I can drink whenever anything's going on during the week.  I think Dating Pen of the Year counts as a sunny day.  But, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  But you know what?  Um, uh, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna cut myself off, uh, when I got a date like that. 
[00:53:30]  Why would I cut myself off?  But if I'm just sitting around at home is what I'm talking about.  I can sit there like I would, run downstairs to the bar, grab a beer, and come back up and sit and just watch TV drinking beer.  So, you know, I just drink water.  That's my weekdays now at home.  What did you wear?  Just a regular, uh.  No, I had, I had nice clothes on there in my bag over there.  I had nice, um, uh, uh, kind of a design, kind of a t-shirt underneath a, um, a, uh, Armani, uh, button-down shirt. 
[00:54:00]  Cool.  And, um, some nice, um, dress jeans.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jordan Ash?  And, uh, very nice shoes also, not my normal combat boots.  Now, you know, again, I'm dressed like a militant from Cuba.  Back to the young, Fidel Castro today.  And, of course, no hat.  I had my hair nice and, um, gelled and, uh, full and follicled.  It was wonderful. 
[00:54:30]  I want to see what she had last night.  Is there a picture on her Twitter?  I'm trying, I'm trying to, uh, pop something up, but I think.  Well, we'll take a break.  We'll find the pictures and.  This is, again, very dark picture, but.  She's very cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got a very, uh, cute, very girl next door-ish look, which I like.  I don't like, I don't like that whole, um, yeah, that's very nice.  Holy mackerel.  I don't like that whole, uh, like, if you're going to be in, in penthouse, that it's a plastic 
[00:55:00]  girl.  Right.  You know, with the fake tits, the fake bleach blonde hair.  Right.  The, uh, the, uh, uh, feet that look like they've been in high heels forever, so they're  all fucked up.  All fucked up.  Right.  She has very, very cute feet, by the way.  I'm not a, I'm not a feet guy.  I'm not a feet guy either.  I've said this many times.  You notice the feet, though.  Part of the whole package.  Yeah.  It's part of the whole package.  Like, if she looks like she does and then had big talons, it's kind of a turn off.  I just think there's so many other things to look at before you look at the fucking feet. 
[00:55:30]  But, you know, you do a head to toe, and you want to make sure there isn't some big  fucking, you know, Sasquatch thing going on.  Big foot corn.  Yeah.  Something like that.  You don't want talons.  No.  Doesn't bother me.  Yeah.  Well, it wouldn't bother me.  It wouldn't be like, it's not a deal breaker.  But it's nice when you don't have to deal with that.  I wouldn't care if her feet had pictures of Magic Johnson on them.  Fucking still lick them.  It doesn't have his blood on them.  I like when a girl's feet stink a little.  Really?  Not terribly, just a little. 
[00:56:00]  And they go, like, smell them.  I don't mind a little, like, a little knowing they're a human kind of stuff going on.  Because girls just smell good, naturally.  They throw off a nice fucking pheromone.  Sometimes.  I like it.  Sometimes you get a good whiff of asshole.  And you're like, yeah, that's...  Steve Carlesi?  Congratulations.  Keeps you honest, right, Jimmy?  Keeps you honest, though.  Like, woo.  Keeps you honest?  Oh, boy.  Like, woo. 
[00:56:30]  It levels the playing field is what it does.  It levels the playing field.  It's like, wow, I thought you were so much better.  It's like, goddamn, I thought fucking girls are supposed to smell nice always.  You don't fucking get a whiff of that every once in a while.  I don't fucking wake you up.  All right, let's take a break.  Very good.  Anthony's date went well.  And Taylor Vixen will be in here in a couple hours to say hi before she heads out and back to L.A.  Back to L.A.  There she goes.  I think Jay Moore's...  Yeah?  I think Jay Moore's coming by, our old friend.  He's playing Gotham this weekend, so...  Yeah? 
[00:57:00]  I think we should sell that fucking Gotham Comedy Club out old school for Jay Moore.  Certainly.  Let's do that.  I'm looking forward to my part on Gary Unmarried, too.  What?  When?  Not happening.  I just wanted to see what that sounded like coming out.  You could probably score something there.  No, I couldn't.  With the Jay coming in.  It's network television.  It doesn't work that way.  You just say, hi, I'd like to do the show, and I'll go, I'll put you in touch with people  that won't do it.  Let's pressure him today.  He does a radio thing on the show.  I mean, we're perfect for this.  Does he?  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  I'll just do scenes.  He does radio stuff on Gary Unmarried, so we're perfect for this.  Yeah.  Bring us in to do some radio shit on Gary Unmarried.  Yeah.  Hey, BJ Penn will be here in, wow, a half hour.  So why don't we take a break so we can do a few other things?  I'm going to fucking armbar him.  Really?  Oh, are you?  Good luck with that.  I hope that works out well.  I would love to see that.  He doesn't budge an inch when you do it, and then just clobbers you over the head with  a big fist.  Drives you in the ground like a nail.  Like rock.  I'm just kidding. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, sorry.  I actually had a fantasy about you getting pummeled.  What would you use armbar?  I mean, you saw a big tent in the front of my pants.  Not be surprised.  Let's do a quick break so we can do other shit before BJ Penn gets in here.  Tom.  It's whipping my wisdom.  Wow.  Nice jugs.  Those are giant jugs.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus.  On Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus, Sirius XM. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  I like that production.  It's hard to do the fucking Whip Him Out Wednesday when you do morning radio, but we don't want  to let that thing go.  That sucks.  We give that bit to you guys.  You guys continue it out there.  We see the wow stickers.  And for the new listeners, maybe we have some new listeners.  I don't know.  Who the fuck knows?  I don't know how the satellite radio works with ratings.  I don't know how many fucking people are listening.  They say we're doing well, but who knows?  Yeah, you just got to depend on seeing the stickers out there. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  That's the only way I can gauge it.  But for the women, you see those wow stickers on the cars, yeah, that basically means that  guy wants to see some boobs.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  And how do they get their wow stickers, Danny?  That is definitely happening.  Tell them how to get them.  Yeah.  They could just send a self-addressed stamped envelope to wow stickers. 
[00:59:30]  Attention.  Opie and Anthony.  12-21.  6th Avenue.  New York, New York.  1-0-0-2-0.  36th floor.  And where is that fucking info?  If they want to find it.  Because they don't have good memories.  They're driving right now.  Like, how am I going to remember that?  Yeah.  Can we put it on the pad data today?  Or is that too many characters?  It's like too much.  Too much?  There's too many characters in this room, if you want my opinion.  Too many characters, like Mr. Ahmed.  We got wow promos running, and I'll figure out a place to put it. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, all right.  I guess we got to get a website or something.  It's been a little too long without a website.  It's a mind bugger.  It really is.  Why would we have a website?  That internet is a fad.  Believe me.  If I had one hour with you two, you both would listen.  Just.  What?  No way.  Yeah, yeah.  It's only, you know, 2010.  Why have a website?  I don't have one either. 
[01:00:30]  You have a website?  I did, but it was the company stunk that was running it, and I'm getting a new one made  by the same guy that's doing my app.  Yeah, I got a guy that wants to do an app.  We need an app.  I got a guy that's doing an app for, wants to do one for me.  Yeah?  I got a.  Well, we have to get individual apps.  We've got to get a show app.  We've got to get, I don't know.  I want an app.  I want someone to come up with a very creative app for me.  Not a basic stupid app.  I want something different. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Then we need a show app.  An app.  I want one, too.  I need an app.  Everyone needs an app these days.  Yeah, apps are taking over the world.  You don't even really need a website these days, but.  You do need it less.  I honestly.  You don't need a home base.  You know, I.  49,000 on Twitter.  It's like, I can talk to that many people immediately, or say now the number.  It's like, eh, there's other ways to communicate.  Yeah.  Yeah, I get it.  We should have the whole.  Oh, Kenny.  We should have the whole fucking bill of goods. 
[01:01:30]  Anthony, I got a guy.  Yeah?  I got a guy.  Jimmy's app could be ready within like 24 to 48 hours.  Stop it.  And he's going to Twitter immediately.  Yeah?  When it's out there.  Yeah.  Put me in contact.  And all it is, everything on my app is just a photo of me.  And it's going to be a $28 app.  $28.  And you click on it and just see a photo of you.  Yeah, but like when I smile, the tooth gleams like a star. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, it's worth every penny.  That's good.  It sure is.  I figure if I just sell one.  Maybe if I have an app that, because your app has to give something to people that they  can't get anywhere else.  That's the trick.  I have a few things in my app.  So what do you do?  You could have things that people could get other places and it's kind of consolidated  into the app.  But then also, there's got to be something there that they can't get anywhere else. 
[01:02:30]  That's right.  I do have that.  Yeah?  Oh.  Of course.  Do not tell until it comes out, right?  Oh, it'll be a big surprise.  Oh, Jimmy.  You click on it and get AIDS.  Yes.  Here's something you can't get just anywhere.  Yeah.  A communicable disease.  You click on the weenie.  All right.  Why don't we move on for now?  Fuck.  We got BJ Penn coming in here in about 15 minutes.  I hope he's not still here when your chick shows up. 
[01:03:00]  Uh-oh.  That's going to be a rough one.  Women love fighters.  And he could just do whatever he pleases.  He wouldn't have to.  He could just charm her.  You know, he's a married man, but it doesn't matter.  Oh, that's good.  Married man, are you?  Married man, are you?  He's married, so that's good.  His kid, too.  But he's a charmer?  Really?  Not just a muscle head?  I'm saying he could just charm her.  He wouldn't have to beat you up or do anything alpha male.  He could just probably charm her.  Yeah, you know, I was UFC champ and had a little rough, you know.  Well, I'd hate to have to take him down a notch. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, that's going to happen.  That's right.  He would explain fighting Machida.  You could say, do you like Popeye?  Funny people, we really do have nothing.  If they don't have a good sense of humor, we're fucking doomed.  That's why it's good when people say, women like a guy with a sense of humor.  And it usually comes up like first.  Guys are always asked, and they're like, oh, girls, I noticed, you know, the face or legs  or ass or tits or whatever.  And girls are always, I like a guy with a nice sense of humor.  That's the first half. 
[01:04:00]  You see, you're forgetting the comma.  That's, I like a guy with a nice sense of humor, but not to fuck.  Yeah.  To drive me to a real man's house.  To drive me to get a good fucking.  Yeah, I like a man to make me laugh while I'm going to get a real cock stuck in me.  We got Greg in D.C.  Greg.  Greg.  Greg.  Hi.  I was hoping that Anthony would be the one who would develop the app that would help  men over 40 detect women under 20 who have daddy issues. 
[01:04:30]  Oh.  Now that would be an app.  That is a useful app.  Yeah.  That would be a useful app.  A lot of you young guys have fucked yourselves, though.  Not you, sir, but a lot of young guys.  A lot of women don't necessarily have daddy issues, but young guys just don't make enough  money.  They don't.  Yeah, it does.  But they're just fucking, you know, they don't do the right thing.  They certainly don't.  You know what it is?  You don't need money to get a younger girl with fucking daddy issues.  Yeah, but that shows responsibility, though.  I'm saying you don't have to have daddy issues. 
[01:05:00]  A lot of guys try to be too cool for the room.  I was a magnet for fucking daddy issues.  Broads with daddy issues.  I was a magnet for that shit for many years.  What the fuck?  Then you realize, whatever.  You just don't want to act like an asshole or too cool for the fucking room.  It doesn't work.  I talk to my girl like this because she's younger.  She'll say something.  I'll go, now, is that what we talked about?  Oh, my God.  Oh, I'm sure she loves that.  Now, what did we say about that? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, you say it just like that, right?  Oh, my God.  Would she be pissed?  She'd smack you in your face.  No, but we were arguing once, and I did Edgar, who nobody on the show knows, but Edgar is  one that she, you don't understand, it's not even a joke, the hatred for Edgar.  She's like, I'm afraid I'm going to bite your face when you do Edgar.  She does not like Edgar.  No, because Edgar's selfish, and he has a little mouth, and he wants his teeth licked because  they're dry.  You want to do Edgar for us?  Jimmy makes a little asshole mouth. 
[01:06:00]  You want to do Edgar for us?  I'm tired.  Lick my teeth and dry.  His mouth gets like a little bunghole with teeth.  She fucking...  He purses his lips.  Yeah, but it's like he's very...  I'll be a fan of Edgar's.  I really think you should be.  Chip, not so much, but Edgar, I think I can handle.  Edgar hates Chip.  Give me a little more Edgar.  Edgar is convinced Chip that she's trying to poison him.  Do you understand that?  Give me a little more Edgar.  She'll say, why don't you have some of this?  And Chip gets very, why do you want me to eat that? 
[01:06:30]  Who told you to tell me that?  It's very...  It's a whole thing going on.  Edgar did?  Yeah, Edgar.  Give me a little more Edgar.  There must...  That must be some fucking household.  Do you know how many times I've heard, I just want my boyfriend?  Give me a little Edgar.  You're supposed to do your duties.  Lick my teeth.  Has she ever licked your teeth?  To shut me up, yeah, but most times she's like, I want to fucking bite you, Edgar.  She talks to him as Edgar, and he's very...  Goddamn Jimmy.  He's very self-centered. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  He walks really slow.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, goddamn.  Keep your mouth, your gutter trash.  Holy shit.  Because if she curses, I'll always tell her, you talk like a woman from lower stock.  Do you have multiple personalities?  I just gotta ask.  No.  Holy shit.  No, but she fucking hates Edgar.  Because these characters come out.  Oh, I hate.  They're very much different.  She hated Chip for a while, but then Chip grew on her. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  But Edgar...  She really hates Edgar.  It's for real.  Yeah.  Right.  Like, it's like, she's like, you don't understand.  I want to fucking...  She's like, sometimes I have to gauge how worth is the fight we're going to have if I fucking  hit you in the face.  Oh, wow.  Edgar.  Edgar's an ass.  Yeah.  Edgar Mellencamp.  I like Edgar.  Yeah.  Edgar fucking rules.  Let's go to Mike in Pittsburgh.  Mike, fuck you.  Fuck your Penguins.  Fuck Crosby.  Goddamn fucking NHL playoffs start tonight. 
[01:08:00]  Just pay attention.  You'll see what happens in the end.  I need a fucking team for the playoffs.  What do you suggest?  I can't go Penguins.  I can't do it.  Well, we'll see what happens.  I might have to go flyers for the in-laws.  Yeah, you probably go.  I might have to do flyers.  What do you got, Mike?  You're a two-city guy.  Hey, Ed, I wanted to know, how long after the kiss goodnight did you get back to the  hotel and whack your bag?  No, I did not whack my bag.  That's a good question, though. 
[01:08:30]  Last night.  Why not?  I bet he leaked enough pre-cum in his fucking pants.  I bet you his cock like a marionette working his ankle.  You think there were a lot of jizz in his underpants when he got home?  It was stringy and leaking.  Did you spill jizz when you hugged her goodnight?  It was like the alien mouth attacking Sigourney and Weaver.  Did you spill warm jizz into your underpants, Ant?  No, no.  When you embraced?  It was getting much too late to do anything but go to sleep. 
[01:09:00]  Did you pop a boner during the...  Pop a boner.  During the date.  Let me think if I popped a boner.  I was plumped for most of the evening.  Just at a nice plump phase where it would have looked impressive but not looked like  I was trying.  Right.  Yeah.  And you want that just in case anything happens spur of the moment.  Well, I have a lot more questions to ask you but fucking BJ Penn is outside our studio. 
[01:09:30]  We should get him right in.  Hey, Mikey, thanks for the phone call and whatever.  Good luck to your penguins.  What can I tell you?  My fucking team is playing goddamn golf once again.  Good luck.  We've made the playoffs, what, four times in the last 15 years?  That's terrific.  Why the fuck am I still spending money on the Islanders?  I don't know.  You want to say hi to BJ Penn or what?  I certainly do.  There he is.  What's up, brother?  How's it going, guys?  How you doing, man?  How's it going?  Great.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  You could plop down over there.  We're all big fans there, BJ Penn.  Who's got a new book out?  I tried to shake his hand like a man.  Like, I wanted to make sure I had a good grip.  Wait, what?  Like, that would make us equals.  How that work out for you?  Wait, wait, wait.  I should have just curtied in a skirt.  Who had the best handshake there, BJ Penn?  Who had the strongest?  Who had the man handshake?  I would...  I think you had the strongest handshake.  Of course.  I know I do.  I screwed up.  I went to grip, but he grabbed just my fingers and shook it.  Yeah, and I got the tip of the hand myself.  I did a little fucking lady, how do you do, handshake. 
[01:10:30]  You show him who's boss, right?  He looked like a faggot.  We saw you on Fox yesterday taking down that anchor.  We were very happy to see that.  Do you know that guy or no?  I just met him that day.  He's pretty tough, though.  Yeah, is he?  Really?  He's pretty strong.  He surprised me.  I was surprised just to see him volunteer to do that.  And he wanted more.  He didn't want to stop.  A lot of guys don't do this.  His tie was flapping around.  He's in a suit and tie, for God's sake.  Now he'll think every anchor wants that, he'll do it to Katie Couric.  That'd be nice to see. 
[01:11:00]  We're just mad because one of our guys wanted to do that.  Where's Mars?  Mars was like, look, I'll fucking do a little something with BJ Penn.  Where's Mars?  Mars has been bragging about his skills for a long time.  Mars likes to think he's a martial artist.  He's got some skills.  He trains.  Here he comes.  Yeah.  He trains in the arms of...  Mars.  Now that BJ Penn is in studio...  You got me wrong.  I said Frankie Edgar.  Now that BJ Penn is in studio, why don't you fucking...  Why don't you fucking...  Why don't you want your mouth off like you are?  Why don't you want your mouth off right to BJ Penn while he's in studio there, Mars? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, now he's got a manly handshake, right?  Mars, would you take BJ Penn on?  Take him on?  A little sparring.  And hopefully he fucking cracks your...  He's trying to think of how do I say no without actually saying...  He wants to act like he's backing off for other reasons.  Just say no.  Look at the sweat on his fucking forehead.  I take on some comparable dudes where I go.  Oh, don't even start.  How can I say...  I hope BJ Penn fucking breaks your windpipe.  I'm sure he would. 
[01:12:00]  We're Cobra Kai dojo.  No, that's Edson Carvalho.  Oh, okay.  So do you get, you know, do you get people trying you wherever you go?  Like, you know, guys that want to see you...  Because it's almost like they don't expect to win.  So if they beat you, they win.  If they lose, so what?  Maybe when I was younger, you know, but now not as much.  Everybody just kind of, you know...  Well, I'm usually at home in Hilo all the time.  So a bunch of friends or people I went to high school with.  But now that I've been doing it for so long, they're just like, that's what he does. 
[01:12:30]  They know better.  You're a small guy?  Like, you're a small guy than I thought we were?  Like, 155 now?  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm about 170 right now.  Wow.  What did you fight at?  155.  But we ended up cutting some water before the fight.  You know, just got to sweat it out.  That's a lot of fucking water to cut.  Jesus.  Yeah, it's amazing to me what these guys do in weight.  Like, you fought Machida, right?  And how old were you?  Like, 190 when you fought him?  185.  185.  And then he fought 30 pounds lower.  That's crazy.  How much can you put on in the day?  Like, when you cut weight, how much can you put on in the day? 
[01:13:00]  I probably put around anywhere from 7 to 10.  It just depends.  Everybody's different.  How do you do that?  With water?  Yeah, I just kind of put on a sweatshirt and kind of lie down by a heater or by...  Oh, I mean, cut weight.  You kind of just sweat it out.  That sounds so uncomfortable.  Is that how you lose the weight?  Yeah, that's how...  Is it hard to fight when you're dehydrated?  Yeah, you got to...  Right after that, you make the weight and then put all the electrolytes back in and get ready  because you got to get all those salts back in.  How long do you have between, like, weigh-in and the fight? 
[01:13:30]  A little over 24 hours.  Wow.  So that's why you...  Some people try to cut 20 pounds like that and you see them go back in and they're just...  They got a good one or two minutes left there.  You're killing yourself, yeah.  Yeah, he said...  Bobby said...  My friend Bobby's a big fan.  He said, Bob...  He said, Lesnar can cut that kind of weight.  Like, you know, he can go from, like, 285 down to 265 for the weigh-in and then right  back up for the fight.  Crazy, huh?  Jeez.  That's unbelievable.  That's an athlete right there, Brock Lesnar.  It makes you heavier.  It makes you, I guess, a harder guy to deal with.  But, you know, you lost the belt. 
[01:14:00]  For anyone who doesn't know, they said it's one of the biggest upsets in UFC history.  I mean, nobody expected Edgar to win that fight.  I was surprised at, like, because you're an amazing jiu-jitsu fighter and the whole fight  was pretty much standing.  Why did everyone that night seem to stand up?  Yeah, but I guess, you know what?  You get caught trying to put on a show for the fans out there.  Really?  Huh.  You know, definitely.  And I like to box, too, you know.  But, you know, things just went the way they did. 
[01:14:30]  It sucks, man.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  So what happens?  Like, did you realize at one point, because we were watching the fight and we're like,  are you going to lose this fight?  Because you couldn't really tell where it was going.  Was there a point in that fight where you were like, I think I'm going to lose the fight  or I have to do something really, really drastic here?  I never thought, I wasn't ever thinking, I think I'm going to lose the fight, but I  was thinking, man, I got to finish this guy off.  You go to the decision, you know, it's like rolling the dice and you don't want to, something 
[01:15:00]  you don't even want to play around with.  But, you know, I kept trying and, you know, I ended up getting fatigued after a while and  Frankie was still there and went to the cards.  Were you, had you trained enough for the, I mean, like, because like, Liddell got, you  know, Chuck is Chuck, so he would, you know, enjoy the life a little bit.  And then it kind of becomes harder, the more famous you get to discipline yourself and make  yourself.  Did you find that at all?  Like, you know, like you had this great life.  It's all of a sudden, it's hard to get up and go to the gym as much or?  No, no. 
[01:15:30]  I've been through that a few times throughout my career, but I trained, I prepared, I got  ready for the fight and, you know, now it's just all, what do I do?  What do I do next?  You know, now it's time to get back on the horse and do it again.  What was the first thing, like, when they said and knew, like, when that word knew came  out of Bruce Buffer's mouth, you knew he had won, what were you thinking when you realized  you've lost the belt?  Like, do you have a thought or you're none?  It was just a real irritating moment. 
[01:16:00]  It's just, I didn't want to sit there and say anything and take away anything from Frankie's  win, you know.  I just, you know, give him his shot and I'll come back another day.  When are you going to have a chance, you think, to get that back?  Well, actually, yeah, the first, yes, two days ago I was just sitting there, I was like,  you know, let's give the UFC a call, throw me in with any top contender, I want to do  this in the next six weeks.  Wow.  Get back and then the UFC called us and said, no, no, we want you to, a straight rematch, 
[01:16:30]  it was a controversial fight.  Oh, wow, okay.  We want to do a straight rematch.  What's it controversial, Jim?  I think, take a champion's belt, I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like when Forrest Griffin beat Rampage, I thought that he should not have taken the  belt because he didn't beat a champ bad enough to take his belt, I thought.  Is that what you mean?  They felt that he might have even...  Yeah, I think because we actually landed more strikes, we did more things when they went  and looked at the copy strike or whatever and they really, that's the fight they want. 
[01:17:00]  They want to put a straight back in the ring against each other.  It is hard on a decision not to go with the champ, a lot of times they do that, unless  you got the shit beat out of you, which apparently you didn't, so yeah, a nice straight rematch.  Wow, that's cool, okay.  When is that going down, BJ?  I think they want to shoot for somewhere around August.  Nice.  So I wanted to get in the ring and be a little more active, but what can I complain about?  I'm going to get the belt back.  What do you do between now and then?  If you were expecting to fight in six weeks, just any contender and stuff, what do you do 
[01:17:30]  in between now and August?  That's why I want to just start fighting as soon as possible.  I'm getting too old to keep starting over from scratch to do these training camps.  I want to just kind of get at a high level and maintain it and just start fighting.  Because I look back, I'm starting to look at it now and it's like the sparring is the  same as the fight, I might as well just do the fight.  You're getting punched in the head, you're getting the brain damaged anyway.  Yeah, you might as well make the money.  Yeah, I might as well.  So you're going to be fighting between now and August then?  Yeah, somewhere in early August. 
[01:18:00]  It doesn't worry you that maybe, God forbid, something happens, you injure yourself?  Yeah, I got over that.  But you're right, it's always there and you're only one punch away from the end every time.  Wow.  How sad were you afterwards?  Because he cried when he won the belt.  I think you said, I looked through a lot of your book, that you cried when you first won.  Do you cry when you lose the belt?  I think I would fucking have a moment where I'd drop the tear.  This time, you know, I've actually lost the belt before, so it's not the first time, but 
[01:18:30]  it's, I'm just, like I said, just really irritated.  I wasn't crying, I wasn't sad, I just knew that I could do much better than that.  Do you think what Anderson Silva did, because it was really, it was like the Gracie Hughes  fight, they both pretty much stood up the whole fight.  You guys stayed on your feet, and then, you know, Silva and Maia was really a, you know,  a weird fight.  I'm sure you've seen it since.  What did you think of that whole thing that happened between him and Damian Maia? 
[01:19:00]  You know, I didn't get to see the fight because I was in the back, just pissed off about what  happened to him, what just happened to me, but I heard the crowd, I heard the reactions  of everything going on, and I guess from what I heard, that Anderson just wasn't very motivated  to fight his opponent, and because right before his fight, Vitor Belfort, right, he was scheduled  to face Vitor Belfort, Vitor pulled out.  I heard it was a motivation factor, but on the other hand, I can see Dana being pissed, 
[01:19:30]  you know, he's trying to do the global expansion, he's trying to move to a new venue, and then  the first show he puts on looks something like this, so I think everybody wasn't happy on  all sides, I know I wasn't at the end of the day.  He seemed like he wanted to really, like, have you ever had a guy in the ring that you  wanted to, because that went, like, you know, like, sometimes guys will, for a round, you  know, beat somebody a little more than they have to before they knock him out because  they're pissed off about something, but he seemed like he really wanted to humiliate  that guy, like, there was something going on, like, he didn't want to knock him down,  at least for the first three rounds. 
[01:20:00]  Have you ever been in the ring with somebody that you wanted to really, really put it to?  You know, before the fight, maybe I really want to put it to him, but as soon as you  step in there, it's all business, and then to me, I think, you know, what can I do to  make the ref stop this thing?  You know, it just runs through my head.  So you don't think about, like, prolonging this guy's agony a little bit?  Um, no, no, I just, the faster knockout, the better, for me, personally.  It is odd that you'll fight someone six weeks after a previous fight, that's something you 
[01:20:30]  never saw in boxing.  Why is that, that MMA decides, you know, you could just fight people within weeks of your  last fight?  Well, I think it, I think it, uh, that's a good question.  I think, you know, because in boxing, the guys are almost like an entity of themselves.  You know, Mayweather and Pacquiao, that's almost like two organizations basically going up and  trying to set a deal.  You'd never see UFC be able to close a deal with another organization and have them put 
[01:21:00]  on a show together.  And that's, in a sense, what it is, you know?  But I think, I think, um, in boxing, you remember Muhammad Ali used to do the bum a month and,  and stuff like that.  Bum a month.  Yeah.  But, uh, you know, I just, towards the, now I'm starting to get a little further on in  my career.  I've been with the UFC for 10 years and I just, I just want to stay active until I can't do  this anymore.  How do you feel like, cause there was a, you know, Dana's had some strife with certain  fighters and you do at one point, you were involved in a lawsuit with UFC and then, um, 
[01:21:30]  you came back and you fight for them.  And it's like, you guys made up, I guess you said, you thank him in the book.  You thank him for, you know, for kind of a furthering, uh, mixed martial arts and what  they've done, but it wasn't a very like personal thank you.  Do you guys have a good relationship or is it strictly a business relationship with a,  you know, no, uh, we, we, uh, we have a, a great personal relationship, but it falls  apart every month.  So, uh, but it comes back.  Is he, cause we know Dana pretty well, but we never dealt with him on a business. 
[01:22:00]  Is he a tough guy to do business with?  Like he's a, he's a headstrong dude.  He's a businessman.  Yeah.  He's a, he's a real businessman.  Yeah.  You don't build what he's built, uh, without, and be like a pushover or somebody that's kind  of, right, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm sure he's, well, just say it, you know, he's a prick to  work with.  What made you want to do a book?  I mean, you always, it's like, do you always want to do a book or you just like, eh, fuck  I can make some money.  Like Jimmy said.  Yeah, exactly.  I sold my mortgage and I'm like, right, right. 
[01:22:30]  That's a hell of a question, Jimmy.  Everybody, uh, kind of, you know, talked to me about doing the book and after a while  I was like, okay, let's do it.  Let's do the book.  And, and, and now, you know, it, it's, it's cool.  It gives a little insight to the, you know, to the people, uh, who fans.  Of MMA or, or fighters trying to start out their careers about, you know, it's not just  two guys stepping in the cage.  What else goes on?  The problems with the management, you know, trying to become a free agent, trying to do  all those things.  And, and, and then I can tell my story a little, you know, a lot of people want to say who 
[01:23:00]  I am or tell people who I am and say I'm lazy or whatever, this and that.  And then just hear it from the horse's mouth, you know, you come from a pretty much like  your family was not like a lot of guys come up, uh, especially in the Brazil, a lot of  guys are really, really poor.  I mean, and, and you come from a family that's pretty good middle class, you know, uh, I thought  you were going to say up from, from, from a, from a really rich family, private airplanes.  No, no, no.  Why?  Did you have that?  I didn't read the whole book.  No, no, no.  But that's what a lot of people think, you know, but I mean, I live a good life. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  When, uh, you know, there was, if, if, uh, you had food on your table and we probably  live the same life, you know what I mean?  So, uh, what motivated you to fight?  That's to me, that to me is almost more impressive.  Like if you, if your family had money, it's like when you're poor, you're trying to get out  of a situation where you, it's like, it's either I fight my way out of this or I got  nothing.  But when a guy has money, it's like what, what, what, it's almost like harder to motivate yourself  to get punched in the face.  It's, it's, it's, I guess something I, I, I love to do.  And, and I guess it's, it's, uh, uh, uh, what do they say? 
[01:24:00]  Uh, live to fight, not fight to live, you know, I just live to do this and, and it's  exciting, man.  There's nothing, yeah, there's nothing better than, you know, I mean, I could be a tough  guy and beat up anybody on the street, but there's nothing better than going up against  somebody who's actually been training every day and looking exactly what I do wrong and  studying exactly how can I beat this guy.  And then when you go in there and beat him, it just gives you a real sense of gratification.  Did you go through a phase where you beat the shit out of people when you were growing  up?  Of course.  Oh, that's great.  Of course. 
[01:24:30]  I like that.  Of course.  Wait, what's the, go ahead, go ahead, Jimmy.  Well, I was going to ask, cause, uh, he mentioned training.  Uh, he's got one of the most amazing videos.  I'm fucking, you're the one jumping out of the pool, right, BJ?  That's right.  That's right.  Holy.  Yeah, that's sick.  You've never seen him jump out of a pool?  No.  Danny, you, could you find that?  Does he do it like I do?  One step at a time?  How many, how many feet?  Well, it wasn't, it was just three feet with the lip.  Just three feet, please.  How high the lip?  Um, probably one of the stitches.  You've never seen this?  Yeah, look at this shit.  I'm going to have to tweet this.  Try doing this. 
[01:25:00]  He jumps out of a pool.  Three feet.  It's a three foot pool.  Squats down.  Squats way down.  To his shoulders.  Holy shit.  Oh, you actually, wow.  You're not using your hands at all.  No.  Wow.  I couldn't do that out of the fucking tub.  And who are the guys in the fucking jacuzzis?  Like, just sitting there like, oh, they've seen it before, obviously.  Because I would have been like, I would have lost my mind if I saw that line.  Show off.  Yeah, you should reshoot that with a bunch of chicks in there.  It'd be much better. 
[01:25:30]  Everybody was, they're like, yeah, how tough is that?  He jumps out of the pool and sits into a jacuzzi with five guys.  Yeah.  Dude, that's, I, that's got to be almost impossible.  Have you seen other guys do that?  But, you know what, they're, it really started a trend and now they've got all these people  out here and, and they're jumping out of pools and they're doing crazy stuff.  But then you've got to remember though, it's got to be the pool with the lip because it  can say three feet and, you know, some pools are kind of equal to the water.  Right, right.  With that lip, that does make a difference.  It adds maybe four to, four to six inches probably. 
[01:26:00]  It's a different dynamic.  You're not just jumping out of water anymore.  You're jumping out of water and then you hit air, you know, and.  That's pretty awesome.  But I'm not a high jumper.  I think it's, it's more, uh, that I got, I got, uh, flexible legs.  Power.  I can't even touch the net, you know?  How tall are you?  Five, nine.  Oh, fuck, he's taller than me.  I said, I said, I said he's not a big guy.  He's fucking four inches taller than me.  That's what I was thinking.  Look who's talking.  I know.  Jimmy.  I annoyed him as soon as he, I'm a mushy twerp.  You suck.  Oh, I really should have my fucking teeth kicked in. 
[01:26:30]  I saw, I saw your training there with the, uh, the dumbbells also.  So, uh, uh, uh, what kind of, what kind of weight was on there?  No, you know, actually I don't lift weights anymore.  I got involved with, uh, with Marv Marinovich and I, I don't know if you guys know Todd Marinovich  from USC and that whole story, but his, his father is a great trainer.  I got involved with him and we're all about speed now, actually speed.  Wow.  Really?  No, uh, no weight training.  Not, not like you think.  Now we kind of, we got this machine where we put weights on and we, we throw one side  and then the weights come in the back. 
[01:27:00]  So it's just constantly throwing things off you.  Jesus Christ.  Instead of that slow, because lifting weights is too slow and, and it, it, uh, it throws  off your nervous system.  You're not as, uh, you're not, you don't have as much dexterity.  It really messes you up.  I believe he convinced me of that.  I believe that now.  And, uh, and.  Did you train with him this fight or you had for a little?  I always, I always, I always.  So it's more practical to, uh, to mixed martial arts than it is to, you know.  I think the sports in general, I, he, he said the way he figured it out is he was, he 
[01:27:30]  got to like a 1100 pound squatter.  So I don't know if he was all the way deep.  I don't know what the record is, but he got to a high level squat and then he realized,  what am I doing?  I'm on my heels.  No sport.  Are you ever on your heels?  You're always on your toes.  And from there, he kind of started basing his program off.  On what you're doing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Uh, cause I, I saw some training going on with, uh, uh, some dumbbells and, um, it  just makes me want to just call my trainer up and say, don't show up.  Yeah.  Just don't show up. 
[01:28:00]  Those.  I couldn't, those are.  I couldn't hand one of those to you with both hands.  Those look like hundreds.  No, no, no.  I don't know what they are.  I see it says 50 on, but.  Yeah, it's 50 on each one.  He's doing a little, uh, lightweight.  That's more than 50, BJ.  No, it's, it's gotta be a hundred.  It's 50 on each side.  I'm looking at this stuff now.  It's just, that's, that's, that's not the, that's not the good way.  It's not the good way to do it.  Yeah.  Wow.  How do you keep up your, it keeps up your muscle mass though, uh, doing the other kind 
[01:28:30]  of speed training.  I guess that that's all food.  Really?  That's all food on the other hand.  Yeah.  And, and yeah, we're doing a lot of strength things.  It's, I wonder if we have in any of the, the videos you want to, you want to check?  Try it.  Is it, is it hard to keep disciplined as far as eating goes?  Things like that?  Or is there something you just, you're like, God damn it.  I want that.  Yeah.  It always, it's, it's that battle, man.  That's how I started, you know, before I never used to have to cut any weight for the  lightweight division.  And then because I cut it once, I started thinking, well, I don't have to cut weight.  Let me eat everything I can. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  I got fat and I've been battling being fat for the rest of my life now.  I fucking go through periods like where I can work out for a few.  Yeah, exactly.  I should stop right there.  You're right.  I'm fucking water weight in my tits.  Shh.  Don't tell him.  We're in front of a real man today, Jimmy.  Keep that to yourself.  Who is, who is this?  Is this, uh, who are you, sir?  I'm his brother.  Oh, you are his brother.  Okay.  Obviously his brother.  Why did that?  They look, they look alike.  He'll kick your ass.  I know he will.  He looks like Steve Byrne. 
[01:29:30]  If Steve Byrne were a man.  This is the kind of stuff we do now, if you want to check it out.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Yeah.  That's the kind of workout.  Just throwing weight around is pretty much it.  Throwing weight.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  What kind of machine is that?  That's called the Bear.  Dub Bear.  Yes.  Dub Bear.  Wow.  D-A Bear.  So there's, uh.  Get off me, it's called.  Is this on your website, BJPenn.com?  That's on BJPenn.com.  So people can check it out for themselves.  Okay.  So how much weight is on there about, would you say?  Um, it's, it's, uh, I think there's not too much weight. 
[01:30:00]  I would say maybe a 35 or 45 pound plate, but it's just how fast you can move.  Yeah.  How fast you can throw.  Yeah.  So if some guy starts leaning on you, you push, now you got the muscle and technique to  just push the son of a bitch off of you.  Because, well, there's, it's a lot of leverage involved, so if you can get there and, and do  the leverage before the other guy.  Wow.  Yeah.  Never seen anything like that.  No, I haven't either.  Everyone assumes, you know, weight training.  And, uh.  I find the elliptical helps.  Do you, Jimmy?  This is.  You fairy. 
[01:30:30]  This is the kind of stuff.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Now you're upside down, uh, kicking with your legs.  Yeah.  There's like one of those exercise balls and he's on his head, on his head and neck.  That looks really, it's like he's jogging upside down but with weight on his feet.  And kicking that weight off.  That looks exhausting.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is probably a hell of a workout, though.  Yeah.  These, uh, these guys, they know, they really know what they're doing.  Yeah.  Do you want to retire at any point?  Like, uh, and then all of a sudden you're like, now I have to keep fighting because I  can't retire after losing. 
[01:31:00]  I mean, what do you want to do after this?  Because nobody wants to fight when they're 40, 45.  I mean, it's.  You're right.  You know, I've, I've, I've, I've gone through.  That, that, uh, retirement issues in my head many a times throughout the last 10 years.  Uh, but exactly like you said, how can you walk away after you can't walk away when you're  doing good and you can't walk away if you do bad, you know, you're stuck.  Well, it's gotta be hard because now the money the UFC is bringing in.  I mean, it's like, it's, it's obviously over the last 10 years, the sport is, it's gone  through the roof.  You were there during the years where it wasn't as popular.  Now it's, it's gotten to this popularity and you don't want to walk away when, you know, 
[01:31:30]  it's, it's at this point.  But how old are you BJ?  Um, I, I'm 31.  Oh, so you got a, you got a bunch of years left, man.  I want to push it.  I want to maybe go to 35 and then after that, you know, maybe go, go home and run for mayor  or something and maybe have a fight.  You know, I'm doing a bad job.  You know, let's, you know, let's, you know, uh, earnings can go to charity or something.  The mayor comes up and fights.  Yeah.  Why not?  Hey, did you get to see Abu Dhabi while you were there?  I got to see some of it. 
[01:32:00]  Some of it?  Or I figured you were there just to fight.  So it's, it's tough to get out and check it out.  We went about two weeks earlier to try to acclimate.  And, uh, it was, it was pretty cool.  You know, we went to the beaches and seen, they got some nice buildings and it is a desert  though.  Yeah.  You know, you never want to forget that.  Yeah.  It's a desert, but.  Did the heat affect everybody or no?  No, it wasn't too bad.  It was actually pretty cool.  It wasn't like, uh, really hot.  It was cool.  Nice breeze coming through.  And I got, I got a friend that lives over there.  He went to the fight.  Actually.  He, he loved it. 
[01:32:30]  He was right near the ring.  Dana White fucking hooked these guys up big time.  They work for the military.  And he goes, he goes, uh, that he's sick.  He's sick of Abu Dhabi.  Cause you just can't see women.  They're all fucking covered up.  And he's like, that's the most frustrating thing about living in Abu Dhabi.  That the women are just covered up all the fucking time.  Is there anything they told you like, Hey, don't do this.  It's against their customs or anything like that.  Did they warn you?  Well, just talking to everybody, just, it all seemed real normal and relaxed. 
[01:33:00]  But then you'd look in the newspaper and you know, like, Oh, woman going to jail for kissing somebody in public.  Man arrested for passing turnip.  That's what's confusing about there.  Cause they're trying to kind of modernize it, but they, Westernize it, but they have all these strict rules still.  And then they have alcohol, but it's connected to a hotel.  So it's kind of like, and I think if you're, I think you gotta have,  like another ID to kind of purchase alcohol.  Oh my God.  I'd have to get that.  Could he split?  Well, uh, Dana White had a hell of a time cause there are some strict rules. 
[01:33:30]  So they had ring girls too.  I was surprised about that.  They had ring girls, but they had to worry about loud music.  They had to worry about the beer intake at the venue.  It was all sorts of things going on that it got, uh, got passed.  Obviously.  God, they must've been getting rods with those ring girls.  Oh man.  Can you imagine?  Some of those guys sitting there just going, Oh yeah.  In America, that's like going to Madison Square Garden and just seeing girls fuck themselves with salami.  Right.  That's the equivalent. 
[01:34:00]  That's gotta be right, Jimmy.  Hey, but you know, it's, it's, uh, didn't they build that arena too, just for that event?  I think they built that in like three weeks.  Yeah.  That was, it was amazing.  The setup that they had, you know, it was kind of just a bunch of campers where we were  cause you just throw the fighters in the back.  Who cares about them?  You know, but the, but the setup they had in the front, that was, was unbelievable.  So I guess they'll keep fighting out.  They're not going to, they're not going to build that.  But then again, in the Middle East, they own part of it now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I heard.  Abu Dhabi government or the company that works with the government, I think picked up 10% of 
[01:34:30]  the UFC.  But aren't they more fans of like that?  I heard they have no control over.  Sorry.  I keep putting my foot where BJ's kicking his out.  I don't want it to come off as aggressive.  Where it's like, they have no say over it though.  It's like if Dana, you know, or, uh, you know, he wants to do something.  That might be.  Yeah.  I could see something like that.  I think that's why Dana was so upset about, uh, the Silva fight also turning out the way  it did.  Cause those are guys that from Abu Dhabi who'd just gotten in 10%.  And he's like, you know, you spend your money. 
[01:35:00]  And yeah, I just have to watch a fight.  That was the main event that Dana absolutely wasn't happy with.  So yeah, he was extra pissed off about that.  Well, we've got a lot of people that want to say hi to BJ Penn.  He's got a new book.  Uh, why I fight the belt is just an accessory.  Let's say hi to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  Hello.  Yeah.  Hey guys, I just want to say, I love the show.  Um, BJ, I'm a big fan of yours.  And I just want to know, do you have any plans on fighting GSP again?  Uh, you know, that was, uh, in, in my head. 
[01:35:30]  Definitely.  I, I, that's a, that's another goal that I want to accomplish.  But, uh, now that, uh, you know, this, this, uh, happened with Frankie Edgar, first things  first, I gotta, I gotta go get, I gotta go get back on top in the lightweight division  and then we'll talk story.  Yeah, I understand.  I think, I think you could beat GSP, but, um, and just one last question.  I don't mean any disrespect when I ask you this, but when you fought Jens Palver the  second time, why did you hold the choke for a few more seconds?  Were you pissed at him or something?  Yeah, maybe a little mad for what, what, what happened over the years, I guess. 
[01:36:00]  But, uh, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's a little bit, uh, it's a little bit of show to what's  going on.  What happened over the years?  Well, me and Jens Palver, just a lot of trash talk.  You know, he was, he was the first one to put me in my place.  He, he kicked my butt one night and, and ever since then it was, it was him saying, I can  beat him every time I see him.  He ain't nothing.  I'll always beat him.  He can never beat me.  And, and sometimes that stuff just grows on you.  You know, radio guys, uh, trash talk a lot, but then we don't have to fucking, you don't 
[01:36:30]  have to choke the guy out.  But we don't have to choke the guy out.  We just avoid eye contact in the hallway like a bunch of fucking girls.  Yeah, we speak a good game on, on, on the mics, but yeah.  Is that true?  And then you give a nod in the elevator.  Oh, fuck it's you.  It's all fun and games, it's all fun and games.  Wimps.  If it was MMA fighters, they'd be choking each other out in the elevators before they came  to work.  God damn.  Anthony?  Yes, Tom.  Um, just one more, one more thing before I hang up.  Can you please do your Jesse Ventura impersonation for me? 
[01:37:00]  I would really appreciate that.  What am I?  A performing seal?  Shut up, Tom.  Exactly.  Don't make me choke you out for a little longer than necessary.  Exactly.  That doesn't make us look good in front of the fighter.  Yes.  Hey, fucking A-Chimp, do that voice you do.  Okie dokie.  Really.  Tom, he'll work it in.  He'll work it in.  Yeah, don't worry.  Later on.  Keep listening.  Good tease.  I was amazed to read this, too.  Like, uh, there's a good, I just put comment on it.  There's a good part where you fought, uh, St. Pierre twice, and he's beaten you twice.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:37:30]  And, you know, he's, he's looked at kind of like the fans love him, and he's, he's seen  his royalty in UFC, but, uh, there were allegations that he had, uh, that was, I forgot about it.  That was the second one where you had commissioned to have his license to fight taken away because  you felt that he was, uh, vaseline-ed up a little bit.  And didn't you hear, like, one fighter who lost to him say, I couldn't grab his legs.  He was coated in vaseline, and you're like, that guy's like, that guy's just complaining  he lost.  Mm-hmm.  And then you dealt with it.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, what happened?  Do you think that, uh, the rules were changed after that, but what do you think was going 
[01:38:00]  on with him?  You know, that's what, uh, what everybody, the conclusion that everybody was coming up  to over the years, you know what I mean?  That, uh, that something like that was going on, and, and we actually got, got a call from,  uh, one of, the guy who wrote, he's writing the book, Dave Weintraub, he got a call  from, uh, Kenny Florian, actually, and Kenny Florian was like,  tell BJ good luck, and then to watch out, this guy's a greaser.  A greaser.  That's what we call Anthony.  But, uh, yeah, that, that, that's something, that's something that, uh, that went on at 
[01:38:30]  that time, but, but honestly, that's not, that's the furthest thing from my mind right  now after, after this, uh.  They changed the rules, though?  Yes.  As far as, uh, how much you could put on?  No vaseline in the locker room, and only, only they put the vaseline on.  The cut man is right, the only one who could have it, and aren't they, they actually work  for the UFC.  Yeah, yeah.  But that was, the book, actually, I, I didn't know that whole backstory, and it's like, you  get pretty honest in the book, which I like.  And actually, in Japan, there's no vaseline allowed, period, on your face, anywhere, because  of that problem. 
[01:39:00]  And, uh, they're, they're, uh, they're really, you know, they got different cultures, so they're,  they're a lot more strict and different rules.  Do you want another crack at him?  Yeah, definitely.  But, you know, it's, it's hard to sit there and say you want a crack at the welterweight  champ when you just lost your lightweight title.  You know what I mean?  So I gotta get back there.  Well, you're the only guy, I think, you and Couture are the only guys to have belts in  two different, uh, weight classes, right?  Yeah, so I, that's, that's, that's what would be nice, I guess, from this, you know, become  a two-time lightweight champion.  That'd be cool.  And then you want to eventually go back and, and go after him.  Yeah.  What, there's rumors now that he's gonna fight, uh, Silva. 
[01:39:30]  That was the big thing that, uh, what was, was Silva gonna come down, or was he  gonna go up?  I think, uh, I don't know what, exactly what's gonna happen, but I think it's a bad idea  if Silva goes down, you know, uh, he's the champion at 185, you know, George, uh, could  try to fight him, but either way, I can't see Silva at 170, that's gonna be tough for  him, man, and George is very, very strong at 170, you know, I, I'd like to see them both  at their best, but I know they're at different weight classes, and who knows how, how it would  end up.  Uh, Jimmy?  Yes.  Uh, Mars wants to ask his question. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, boy.  Mars, you had a question?  Yeah, Mars, uh, huge MMA fan.  Oh, boy.  I, I actually didn't have one, BJ, but I, I, I thought of one.  You got your BJJ purple belt under...  BJJ?  Yeah.  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.  Okay.  I didn't know what it was.  Purple belt under, uh...  But it was stuttering.  The Gracie, correct?  Under health Gracie.  And then, and then, uh, you received your brown belt and black belt from who?  From Andre Petteneris.  And why was that?  Why did you...  I ended up moving back to Hawaii from, uh, from California.  Yeah, but so I, I, like, about one month after I got my, uh, purple belt from health 
[01:40:30]  Gracie, I, that's the last I trained with him.  I trained with health for about a year and a half.  Okay.  No bad blood there with the Gracie's?  I mean, maybe there's some bad, uh, bad blood from health, and I know that he probably is  not, uh, is not too fond of me, but, you know, you know what?  But looking back, I, you know, he really helped me a lot.  I really don't really have anything bad to say about him.  He, he really tried his best to help me.  You know, I, I ended up moving back to Hawaii.  He's, he's, uh, I'll bend out of shape about it, but, you know, he might be pissed off and 
[01:41:00]  this and that, and I'm just like, uh, whatever.  You helped me a lot.  I got nothing bad to say.  Well, you thought, uh, it was, uh...  Thanks for bringing it up, Mark.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Anything else unpleasant?  Having a good time talking over here.  And, uh, you put a pall over the whole room.  So I'm going to get drunk and shake your pants one New Year's Eve.  Thanks.  You can throw Mars, you can throw Mars for that double glass and we'll videotape it and  make it a fucking video sensation.  Fuck Mars.  I can't win for losing around here.  Trying to keep it light and fun. 
[01:41:30]  You can't.  You can't win, Mark.  But you fought, uh, I never know how to say the, the, uh, the Gracie names.  Is it Henzo, is that you say his name?  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, you, you and Hugh, I think you beat him in a decision, right?  Uh-huh.  And you said that kind of helped a lot of the bad blood once you guys just, like, he was fighting  for his family's thing and you guys got to get on there and settled it and it kind of  helped things a little bit.  Um, maybe it kind of made things worse, actually.  Oh, did it really?  Yeah.  Well, there I go.  Just jumping right in the fucking dickhead.  Good one, Jim.  Thanks.  I got that.  Thanks.  I got it completely wrong.  You couldn't have been more wrong. 
[01:42:00]  I couldn't have been wronger if he walked in if I said, congratulations on your victory  last week.  I really am a fucking idiot.  My apologies.  Did it make it work, probably because you, uh, you won?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably if I would have, if I would have got beat up, it might have been better.  But, uh, you know, between me and Henzo, Henzo's a businessman.  He's not about that.  But it's more, I think, Hal's been out of shape.  But I'm not the only guy.  It's all of his students.  Every one of his black belts have left them.  And it's one of those things, you know, if you don't want to see anyone ever again,  tell them not to leave.  You know what I mean?  Right.  But if you say, go ahead, go, come back, show me what you've learned, you know, then 
[01:42:30]  he'd still have all his guys.  And that's just the nature of the game.  So guys get possessed.  I didn't realize guys got possessive in that world, too.  Oh, very, very possessive.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  They don't want you.  In the world of martial arts, you know?  Not as much in the UFC because, you know, it's a money thing and everybody's professionals.  In there, it's an honor.  It's a different thing.  As far as getting your belts and moving up levels.  Yeah, you're one of their soldiers is what it is.  So it's almost looked at, I guess, as disloyal.  He's a traitor. 
[01:43:00]  You're a traitor.  Jeez, wow.  Who knew that was going on?  And all the guys who are in UFC that we've talked to, we've talked to a lot of the guys.  Every one of them has been nice.  It's amazing, like, with boxing, there's a weird, and again, maybe because, I don't know,  they're making $20 million a fight, but the UFC guys are always nice.  And I do credit Dana with a lot of that because I like the fact that he keeps a lot of this  stuff public.  Like, it's not all this lawyer shit.  I'm sure that's part of it.  But when he was mad at Tito, he said he was mad at Tito.  And he's a pretty, you know, he was mad at Silva, and he goes, hey, he's running around 
[01:43:30]  like a jackass.  But at least Silva knows, hey, he's pissed off at me.  There's no, you know, there's no fucking...  He sets the tone.  And the fighters are following his lead, man.  And we...  It's good.  We met...  I met BJ once.  You don't remember.  Reed Harris introduced us.  Bob Kelly.  You know who Bob Kelly is?  Reed Harris, from WEC?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Bob Kelly's a comedian.  And he's a huge...  Use the term loosely.  Exactly, yeah.  Bob's just a fucking creep.  And he loves you.  And this is...  And what's the thing you do?  Because you're from Hawaii.  It's when you put your thumb, I believe... 
[01:44:00]  What's it called?  Little shaka.  Little shaka, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  And you do that.  And so we met at the...  I want to say it was the Lesnar fight.  It could be the Forrest Griffin fight.  And I just said, hello.  And Bobby went, hey, man.  And he did that at you.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  He did the hand...  The shaka, yeah.  The shaka.  The shaka.  And you did not give it back to him.  You walked away like he took his dick out.  I was so fucking happy.  I should have given him that fist in his face.  Do you really?  If you would have just knocked his teeth out, nobody would have faulted you.  You could do us a favor and knock out our friend Bob Kelly. 
[01:44:30]  It would make us all real happy.  Stupid Bobby.  Yeah.  Just crushing his skull, please.  I have wanted to ask a UFC guy this for a long time.  Because, I mean, a lot of guys probably think that I wrestle around too.  But I really don't.  But how do you put somebody in an arm bar?  I would like to be put in an arm bar, but not a real one.  Could you put me in one, but not a real one?  Just to show me how your position is?  No.  Make it real, Jimmy.  Come on.  I mean, I don't want it to be...  No pressure on it, yeah.  No pressure, I mean.  I want to know what that feels like.  Lock it in. 
[01:45:00]  Let's see.  A little pressure.  Let me see if I can even do it.  A little pressure.  A little pressure.  Just...  Oh, he's got his leg across me.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Across his neck.  Holy...  All right, he's tapping.  Jimmy just tapped.  Wow.  Wow.  Dude.  Dude, that is fucking horrible.  Holy...  I thought it was just going to be some fun thing where they kind of hold your arm.  What happens is, and you've all seen the arm bar, but his legs...  When I saw the sneaker coming up, I was like... 
[01:45:30]  There was a sneaker across your waist, a leg across your waist.  Holy shit.  The other leg was across pretty much your chest and neck.  Yeah.  And then your arm was between his legs, and then he pulled down on it.  He pulled back.  Had a lot of leverage on you.  But I didn't realize...  And we were sitting in the chair.  Yeah, and he's sitting in a chair, and you tapped out in a chair.  He's lounging.  He's got the remote in one hand, and me groveling in the other.  But this is what I didn't realize about that.  Besides the fact that your arm is ready to be ripped out, it puts pressure on your fucking... 
[01:46:00]  It stretches you both ways.  I didn't realize it did that.  You were being bent in half.  Horrendously.  And it's amazing.  I thought he would just stop, but he was like, he's waiting for me to tap.  I just gave a little ankle tap, like, sir.  Yeah, Jimmy tapped his ankle.  Obi got all that, by the way.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I got it.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I cannot wait until this one goes live.  I literally went, you...  Could you stop doing that?  But that makes, by the way, just feeling what that feels like, that makes watching guys get 
[01:46:30]  out of it even more impressive.  Imagine that now, with him putting real force on that.  You fucking...  What are you going to do?  Well, Dan Hardy, in the fight against, actually, St. Pierre, was literally being bent.  What would...  Why didn't he tap?  Oh, my God, right.  Yeah, his shoulder would look like it was going to...  The inside of his elbow was almost bent the other way.  Oh, yeah.  That one time that happened.  You know, some people got flexible arms and flexible joints.  That's why sometimes you got to choke them.  And then again, you know, I think Dan was like, F you. 
[01:47:00]  I'm not going to tap.  You're not going to finish me tonight.  Wow.  He'd risk just his arm pulling out of the socket.  And he even got stuck where his shoulder was in a bad spot, too.  And I think it was a very...  Dan is strong mentally.  And he was like, I'm not going to let this happen.  That was an amazing fight.  Dude, when you feel that, I can't believe that fucking...  It wasn't like...  I knew he wasn't going to hurt me for real.  But it's like, you could feel like, oh, I see where this is going.  You know what you mean?  My camera wasn't on.  Could BJ do that again? 
[01:47:30]  No, how about you get fucking Danny or somebody else to try it on me?  Oh, man, my camera wasn't working.  Please.  What was the...  Please.  What is the...  We got to get him out of here, by the way.  Oh, you got to go?  He's real late.  He's got other stuff to do.  Oh, I think we could talk to you for another half hour, BJ.  Yeah.  Are you doing more stuff at SiriusXM?  I don't know.  I don't know what they got planned.  No?  Oh, you're leaving the building?  Okay, we want to be fans and get a couple of pictures.  But BJ Penn, I've been looking at the book.  We really got to get him out of here.  It's honestly, it's great.  All the stuff I mentioned, the feud with Dane and the Gracies, all the stuff is talked about 
[01:48:00]  in here, which I like that you kept it honest.  It wasn't just for inspiration.  It was fucking honest about what happened.  It's called BJ Penn, Why I Fight.  The belt is just an accessory.  And it's great, man.  What I read of it, I really loved.  Thank you.  Thanks for coming in, man.  We're having a happy day.  Right on, BJ Penn.  I want to thank the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank all you guys, man.  BJ Penn.com, too.  Oh, thank you.  Because he's uploading videos of his appearance, the fans are saying.  So that's pretty cool.  All right, we'll continue. 
[01:48:30]  Any Tom Petty fans?  Any Tom Petty fans?  Me and Del was singing, Little Runaway.  Great tune, right?  I heard this at a Super Bowl a couple years ago.  I never heard it.  The rain was unstoppable.  I'm a big Tom Petty fan.  21 years ago.  I liked him in that Kevin Costner movie, The Postman. 
[01:49:00]  Was he in The Postman?  Yeah.  That's what ruined that movie.  It was terrible.  Tom Petty released his first solo album 21 years ago today.  It was Waterworld on dirt, by the way.  You guys hear his fucking show on SiriusXM?  No!  Is it on XM?  Is it on Sirius?  Is it on both?  I don't know.  Where does he do it from?  We were one company.  What happened?  Tom Petty does a pretty good fucking radio show playing, you know, stuff he likes and stuff.  Oh, look at somebody saying here.  It's Blake Snake saying, yeah, in 1979, Opie.  What? 
[01:49:30]  You like fucking Tom Petty?  Tom Petty is still fucking doing it.  But he got you so bad.  Did he?  Did he?  Did he?  He got you.  Oh, did he nail you?  Oh, oh.  Fucking rookie.  Oh, oh, oh.  So BJ Penn leaves the studio.  Great interview, by the way.  Loved it.  Make sure you get his new book.  Really cool guy.  I think he's going to become a friend of the show.  He was so down on that.  Very nice, dude.  And what did he tell you, E-Rock?  Oh, my God. 
[01:50:00]  So if you were listening in the video, hopefully it will be up on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio,  in about a half hour or so.  Well, shit got hairy in here.  Yeah.  It got ugly.  Jimmy decided to take an arm bar from BJ Penn.  Yeah, it got a little tense.  A couple of men decided to settle a score.  And I love how you go, I want to be in an arm bar, but not really.  How did you phrase it?  Meaning I wasn't trying to.  And I'm like, yeah, right.  Like, BJ Penn's not going to try to make it hurt a little bit because he's got a reputation.  Meaning I wanted to see what the motion of the arm.  And it's like when you do something like that with a guy like that, I want it to be clear 
[01:50:30]  that I'm not being a dick and going, come on, let me see what you got.  Right, right.  Because guys are assholes, macho.  So basically you were showing respect.  Yeah, because I want to see what it feels like, but not like, hey, let's see what you  got.  Right, right.  I just wanted to see what it felt like.  Okay.  And he showed me.  Because I'm sitting there, and when his sneakers came up, and what did he say, Yurok?  Apparently I didn't get the full arm bar.  Walking him down to another studio, and he's describing doing the arm bar on Jimmy. 
[01:51:00]  And I guess it's his brother he's talking to, and he goes, yeah, he's like, I was trying  to find his chin.  I couldn't find his chin.  I couldn't get it under his chin.  He wanted to block his foot in under your chin.  But he couldn't find Jimmy's chin.  The fact that you don't have a chin actually saved your life.  Yes.  So you shouldn't bitch about being chinless anymore.  I would be a great MMA fighter.  Because every time they would do it, I would just kind of morph and just kind of slither out  like a fucking ghost. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, that's great.  You couldn't find your chin.  That was fun.  Now it's the next one I got to get put in.  We got to get, like, the next fighter we have in here, I want to try one of the fucking,  uh, what did Lesnar lose?  The ankle, uh, the Achilles fucking.  Like an MMA cuppled.  You want to just try something.  I want to see what those things feel like.  Yeah?  Yeah?  Yes.  Dick up your ass.  Yeah.  Pretty much where they could go.  I would tap.  Absolutely.  You'd tap?  Yeah.  Tap at the tip?  Yeah.  Tap at the base of his cock?  Okay. 
[01:52:00]  See, I wouldn't mind losing a fight like that because you just tap the guy and go, I've had  enough.  Yeah.  I would hate to get knocked out the way fucking.  Big fist just plowing into your face.  Frank Mir can't stop getting beaten up.  He loves it.  Loves getting punched about the head and face, chest and neck area.  Oh, it's like he's doing penance for past sins.  Yes, Mars?  Do you have something to add?  No.  No.  Mike's on?  Yeah.  Hey, uh, Jimmy, I wouldn't take a heel hook because it's very little play and once they  put it on, it could do damage.  Well, I'll take one. 
[01:52:30]  But I'm going to tell them just to show me the position.  Right, right.  I don't want them to actually hook it.  How about, how about a choke?  God damn it.  No, a choke doesn't hurt.  A choke is scary, man.  No, but you just go to sleep.  Fuck that.  You just go to sleep.  That's what happens when you die.  No, I won't do that, but I will, I will let them show me.  Again, it's almost like show, show me the position.  Like, okay, I can't move.  And that's it.  It's time I'm going to try to get out of it.  But a heel hook, that's what, is that what tap Mir, what Mir tap left away?  I think so.  That or an ankle lock.  I'm not sure.  I don't recall.  But a heel hook is dangerous. 
[01:53:00]  But it's amazing, though, when a guy has you like that, it's like, you really are.  You're just stuck.  You're fucking stuck.  You know what you are?  You're an elk with a fat ass in the mud while lions fucking attack you.  Exactly.  You were.  You're the elk with the fucking juicy ass that the other elks would make fun of while  lions jumping on you half.  Half stuck in the mud as they're eating you.  Yes.  That sucked.  That was fucking cool, though.  That was very cool.  The video is going up, and you're going to love it, people, because I saw it live, and 
[01:53:30]  Jimmy's face is priceless.  Dude, to get put in a fucking, you know, a position by a fucking two-time champion, it's  fucking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fucked up.  Very cool, very cool.  I got something to do when I get home to my girlfriend.  Fucking arm bar that bitch.  It'll be up in, uh.  Her poor little arm would just snap off.  Yeah, stop moving.  Oh, and the problem with Edgar, his tongue doesn't bend, so that's why his tongue comes 
[01:54:00]  out.  He's like.  Ew, it's like hard and pointy, like a bird's tongue.  I can't lick my teeth.  So fucking gross, dude.  You're disgusting.  Dude, she'll actually call him by name.  She'll be like, just fucking go away, Edgar.  How do you keep that girl?  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  Makes me happy to be Edgar.  She's fucking beautiful.  You're gonna lose her, man.  I lose them all. 
[01:54:30]  Jesus Christ.  Goddamn, Jimmy.  That's funny, girl.  Yeah, it should be up in 13 minutes here.  13 minutes?  On OP Radio.  How long it takes?  YouTube channel.  What?  Yeah.  It's that it takes so long.  It's stupid.  Fucking bricks.  Fucking bricks.  I, um.  I want to bring something up.  Oh, no.  Uh, of course, it's about our great president, Barack Hussein Obama.  I'm surprised you feel that way.  Yeah.  You know what, Ant?  Yeah.  I know what you're gonna say, and, uh, I agree with you. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  I really do on this one.  There is.  I really fucking do.  A pride in this nation that we have, uh, uh, been able to hold on to for many, many years.  And it is called the space program, NASA.  Uh, we have been kicking ass in space for years with what we have done.  The technology we have been able to come up with as a country, um, out of want or need to do stuff in space. 
[01:55:30]  We figure it out.  We build it, and we did it.  And, uh, it still shows today with the International Space Station that, by the way, is international in that we paid for over 90% of it.  Wow.  As, as, uh, the United States, um, that we've ferried up most of the equipment on, uh, uh, previous shuttle flights.  Because that's all the shuttle has done, uh, the past few years is just, you know, ferry up equipment and attach it to this big space station that can be used by any, uh, country that wishes to, uh, go up there and, and do their experiments. 
[01:56:00]  And, um, we went to the moon.  We, we've just done amazing, miraculous things with the space program that has not only gotten us into space and done these amazing things, but has given us technology that we use every goddamn day.  In computers, uh, in, in just household, um, equipment, televisions, your kitchen, your cars, there isn't one thing you use on a daily basis that hasn't in some way, shape, or form come out of the space program, uh, in this day and age. 
[01:56:30]  It's, it's amazing.  Uh, different alloys that were, were needed out of necessity to, to lighten things.  We use them on cars now.  It's just, uh, astounding.  Now, under, uh, the wonderful Barack Hussein Obama, NASA's funding has been cut, um, and the shuttle program is finished. 
[01:57:00]  There are three more shuttle flights, uh, after this one.  And then the shuttles are all going to be retired.  They are an aging fleet.  How long will those three shuttles, uh, bring us to, like, a year from now?  Yeah, probably about...  Like, every four to six months?  A year, probably about a year.  Maybe a little over?  Within 2010, it'll be done.  So I'm saying, a little over a year, no more space shuttle missions, no more... 
[01:57:30]  By 2011, it's, it's done.  So then, our astronauts, what, have to go to Russia to hitch a ride?  Yeah, this is what, what, what's happening now.  To go to the space station?  In order to go to the space station that we paid for, pretty much.  That's ridiculous.  We have to now pay the Soviet Union...  It's fucking ridiculous.  It's Russian now, but, uh, you know, we have to pay the Russians to ferry us up in, into the space station,  because we don't have a spacecraft to take Americans into space anymore, because the, the programs have been cut. 
[01:58:00]  It's embarrassing, as a nation that was so proud of, uh, uh, the Apollo program, um, Apollo 13, the, uh, the, the, the ingenuity that was used to bring those astronauts back, uh, from Apollo 13.  And, um, just the shuttle programs, uh, the, the, you know, obviously the disasters happened, but what they've done over the years with the shuttle is amazing.  For how many flights they had, and to have two disasters like that, um, it's, it's really an amazing safety record, quite frankly. 
[01:58:30]  For 86 and then a couple years ago, right?  Yeah, yeah, it's, it's just...  When we're off the air.  I am embarrassed.  That's like six years ago.  I'm embarrassed for our country and our stupid fucking president that the funding has been cut to the point where we don't have a spacecraft, uh, that, that can take our astronauts up to, uh, the space, uh, station.  Can I ask you something?  I thought there was supposed to be a new fleet of, uh, shuttles.  No.  I remember reading about that about a year ago. 
[01:59:00]  They, they were funding a new spacecraft, uh, a regular type of, uh, rocket, you know, your standard capsule, uh, rocket ship, not a, uh, a glider that comes back.  The shuttle program is, is done.  Uh, they've talked about, they've talked about it, uh, getting a shuttle, um, uh, another shuttle program, but, uh, the money, too much, and they will not fund the program.  Can I ask you a question? Is, does it have anything to do with the fact Richard Branson and all of these private industries are now making them or going to be making them? 
[01:59:30]  And maybe in the next five to seven years, there's going to be a lot of, I mean, I'm asking a lot of alternate ways to get up.  Like, again, I know they can't, they can't do what the shuttle can do, but is it going to become something that's going to become obsolete as private industry makes more and more of these, uh, spacecraft?  Yeah, I, I, I think in years, many years to come, you're going to see a lot more private enterprises, uh, coming up with spacecraft to take people into space. 
[02:00:00]  Right now, isn't the time to cut the programming, though, uh, the program, though.  It's, we're not at that point yet.  I think we should all just...  There's a giant gap in, between NASA and the, uh, government-funded space program and private enterprise ferrying astronauts and whatever up to, uh, uh, the space station.  But how cool is it that we have a space station up there right now?  Yeah, great, and we've got to go to the Russians to go up to it.  Now, what happens, what happens if, if, uh, we have a falling out with the Rooshkis? 
[02:00:30]  That happens every few, few years, and they tell us to go fuck ourselves.  Now we can't even use the space station, which represents the high ground, uh, quite frankly.  Um, and they're now in charge of something we paid 90% of, so that the French and fucking Russians and Germans and whoever else want to go up there can go up there, but we can't.  Haven't we always cooperated space-wise, though?  Yeah, we've been pretty good.  Even Apollo-Soyuz during the Soviet years, we were there.  Um, but this is, this is an embarrassment for the country. 
[02:01:00]  But the space station is the coolest tree fort ever.  It really is.  Isn't it the bestest tree fort?  Yeah.  It's a tree fort, but they, but the big, but the big brother pulled the ladder up on us.  But that's all it is.  It's a tree fort.  It's the coolest tree fort.  They're not really doing anything.  They're just hanging out going, look what we could do.  It's where the lords hang out.  That's right.  The lords.  Hey, uh, we got a guy from, uh, from a little, uh, little, little, little, little, uh, I was  going to call it a company. 
[02:01:30]  A little company called NASA.  What the hell?  Yeah.  Mike in Houston.  What's up, Mikey?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Ant.  Normally, you are dead on about everything here.  You're not entirely right.  All right.  Isn't Obama cutting the funding?  Can I, if you guys got, like, 30 seconds, I can give you a little bit of background.  We'll give you, uh, we'll give you 22.  Okay, good.  After, uh, after Columbia, uh, George Bush created the vision for space exploration.  Said we're going to the moon, to Mars and beyond.  Uh, and, uh, he created a budget for what's called the constellation program. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  So the president, uh, uh, you know, he gives his budget and then Congress, Congress passes  an authorization bill saying, this is how much NASA is allowed to spend.  Mm-hmm.  Then they have to pass what's called an appropriations bill.  Right.  That's where they actually say, this is how much money we're going to give you.  You know, there was money authorized.  Congress said, you will have this many billion dollars to build these big moon rocks.  I, I, I know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that was under Bush.  Well, Congress never appropriated that money.  Constellation was never funded. 
[02:02:30]  That's why it was so far behind.  So now we've spent eight billion dollars and we have nothing.  We have what's essentially one big model rocket, the Ares 1X.  That thing that went off, uh, about, uh, about a year ago now.  Yeah.  We've had nothing else.  So, and Obama didn't cancel this.  It was underfunded under George Bush.  I, and so, so, so now what Obama's doing is essentially rearranging the funds so that  we actually might be able to do something in the future.  He can't, no, I, I know, but I know Obama canceled that program that was supposed to 
[02:03:00]  take us to the moon as a launching pad for, uh, uh, a Mars mission.  But the program of record was unsustainable.  So, uh, they had the Augustine commission and we appointed a blue panel commission.  Uh, uh, the, the same guy who ran that, uh, after the challenger accident, this guy, uh,  So how is it, okay, how is it, if Constellation was given to us today, the first thing that  we would do is cancel it because it will be too expensive. 
[02:03:30]  How is it then we were able to go to the, how is it then we were able to go to the fucking  moon in 1969 and we can't do, we can't fund it now?  They put about 1.5% of, of, of, uh, the, the, you know, of the, the national budget went  towards NASA for those 10 years.  So, so do it again.  Do you know how many jobs that makes?  Do you, 0.3%.  But do you know how many jobs that makes and how many, uh, uh, how much technology, how  much technology comes out? 
[02:04:00]  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  And how much technology comes out of it?  You know, it's, it's amazing.  Is it not worth, is it not worth it?  You're a Republican.  You're saying that, that NASA should be a jobs program.  No, I'm saying it's a program that over the years has given this nation pride and a product.  I, I totally, I'm there with you, but you have to spend the money the right way and  you have to have the right goal.  I don't like the fact that his, uh, fiscal year, uh, 2011 budget came out and there was  no plan and there were no details. 
[02:04:30]  That sucked its dick.  So what plan is there in place?  What plan is there in place?  Obama didn't cancel the shuttle, by the way.  That was...  No, no, I, I know, I know Obama didn't cancel the shuttle.  I wasn't saying Obama canceled the shuttle.  Check.  ...by $6 billion over five years.  Right.  I wasn't saying Obama canceled the shuttle.  Believe me.  I'm not saying that.  You kind of did.  No, I didn't.  You kind of did.  I said that there is nothing in place and it is so low priority to put, uh, to have  a craft that will put our men in space, our people, whatever the fuck.  I think it's obscene that we have the space shuttle, that it's hitting a bunch of great 
[02:05:00]  missions in a row and now that they're saying that we're going to cancel it, I think that  that is moronic.  Exactly.  But you have to realize it takes an army of workers to get that orbiter flying, uh, every  time.  It is not, it was supposed to, you know, it was an experimental vehicle.  It was never supposed to become operational.  We can't treat it like an operational vehicle.  Well, this takes a crap load of work every time.  What's the next step in, in, what is the next step then?  What is the plan for getting Americans back in space on American built and launched, uh, 
[02:05:30]  spacecraft?  We have no idea.  Exactly.  That's what I'm talking about.  Actually, on the 15th, uh, Obama was supposed to be having a space summit.  Oh, he's too busy fucking giving, giving our nuclear arms away.  He's going to be there for 45 minutes.  We don't know.  That's the, the, the frustrating thing is nobody knows.  Well, that's, that's what upsets me.  This is a president who isn't making this a priority.  And, and to tell you the truth, I think it's a big priority.  It's, it's, uh, like I said, it, it creates jobs. 
[02:06:00]  It creates technology, which creates more jobs.  I'm just saying it's, it's so much has come out of the space program and we are throwing  it away and relinquishing our, um, superiority to a lot of other countries, including again,  fucking China who, you know, have rockets that say, uh, place on ground life, fuse get  away and we got, they got better rockets than we do now.  At least they could put people in space.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, please.  Rockets than we do.  That is not even close. 
[02:06:30]  What they have is a rocket that is based on the Russian Soyuz technology.  So they pretty much bought all of the Russian designs and then added their own couple of  little tweaks to it.  What the Russians and Chinese have is not even close.  A big Vostok rocket.  The guys from Lockheed and the guys from Boeing, most of the rockets that launch stuff now,  it's not even close.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Mike in Houston who works for NASA.  I have a question though.  For, for Mike?  Yeah, Mike.  All right.  Oh, he's gone.  I didn't do that.  I'm sorry.  No, that's all right.  There was a, there was a, they were going to try some program because there was this 
[02:07:00]  new hotshot astronaut who was supposed to be really good.  Oh, really?  Jimmy?  Yeah.  What's his name?  Lorenzo Fuzzbutter.  No, it's not.  It is.  Fuzzbutter.  Fuzz, F-H-U-Z-Z-B-H-U-T-T-E-R.  Lorenzo Fuzzbutter.  Yeah.  And he's a hotshot astronaut.  He's a hotshot astronaut.  Kind of a loose cannon.  He does loop-de-loos.  That's, that's what makes him a hot astronaut?  Loop-de-loos? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  What are they called?  Or whatever.  Pretty much loop-de-loos.  I don't care what, what they, he calls them.  Yeah, he has Rocket Man tattooed on his bicep.  Anthony, question for you.  Yes.  You bitch and complain when Obama spends so much goddamn money and now this is saving the  United States of America a lot of money.  What's your feelings on that?  Do you think I bitch and complain when he spends money?  No.  Well, the healthcare thing.  I bitch and complain when he spends money on shit I don't think is productive for this  country.  That's, that's what I, I complain about. 
[02:08:00]  So, so, space program, very productive for this country.  Very productive for this country.  Healthcare, not so much.  Very productive for this country.  Healthcare, not so much.  Do you know?  Obama, Obamacare, not so much.  Do you know what medicines and stuff have come out of the space program?  Everything, dude, everything.  Tang.  And eye drops.  Yes, beautiful tang.  Little known fact, eye drops.  Oh, did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just saying, it's, computers, the advancement of computers because of the space program  and the military, war, just is astounding. 
[02:08:30]  So, I don't.  Is Neil Armstrong on your side?  Yes, Neil Armstrong is definitely on our side.  He's very pissed off?  It's embarrassing as the United States of America to not have a ship that could take  fucking American astronauts up into space.  Is that what Neil Armstrong is saying?  Yes.  Because I'd rather listen to what he has to say about the space program.  Yes, one small step for man.  He's a, well, he said he said for a man.  A man.  He's kind of a recluse.  He doesn't come out unless it's some major event with Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin and  him.  I'm sure Aldrin wants to punch somebody. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, you know, he does.  Slug someone in the head.  Speaking of famous space quotes, you were telling me before the show about Houston, we got a problem.  Yes, you know something?  It was, I believe, 40 years ago yesterday that Apollo 13 had their big malfunction that  you might remember from the movie Apollo 13.  Starring Tom Hanks.  Starring Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell.  And, you know, he actually said, Houston, we've had a problem.  Not we.  Not Houston, we have a problem. 
[02:09:30]  Really?  Yes, they changed it for the movie to make it sound a little more urgent.  Like, we have a problem instead of we've had a problem.  Sounds like, all right, we had this problem.  But we have a problem is, but the actual line was, we've had a problem.  The reason they changed it, and Hank said this in an interview, is because he believes  that apostrophes are for queers.  And he won't say we've ever.  All right, listen, we, uh, God damn, we, uh, no NASA, no I Dream of Jeannie.  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  See, we wouldn't have had I Dream of Jeannie.  Uh, privatize.  Are we really going to discuss space for a while?  No, I just wanted to say, I don't give a shit.  You think I care what the listeners fucking think about this?  I care.  They care.  Ah, you think I give a shit?  I am complaining because it's embarrassing.  Listen, as a proud American who watched, uh, uh, the, the first men step out onto the  moon as a little lad, I am embarrassed.  Little lad, you're in high school. 
[02:10:30]  I was running the ship.  I was at Houston Control.  She was fucking standing there with an afro.  Fucking bell bottoms.  You drove your, you drove your boys to the local movie theater to check it out.  Who are you kidding?  Listening to rock music and bad-mouthing your country, I'll bet.  No, I watched a little TV in Flushing.  Now, we got lots going on.  We got your date from last night outside the studio.  Yes.  But we want a break before we do that.  But before we even break, we want to do something else because there's so much going on today.  Remember yesterday, the energy drink video? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  We got the guy supposedly on the line to explain it.  And then we'll get Taylor in here.  Taylor Vincent.  Do we have to break?  How long have we been going?  Oh, we don't have to break.  Yeah, why don't we not break?  I'm not saying we're breaking like right this second.  But now we're not breaking.  Because we found out that Taylor only has the night.  Taylor's got to leave at nine.  Let me grab this phone call real fast.  Just because yesterday, Danny brought it to our attention, this video, where this guy  who's trying to get an energy drink going put, what, hundreds and hundreds of cases of  the energy drink in his house.  And his mom freaked out. 
[02:11:30]  Do you remember that from yesterday, everybody?  I hope you do.  I do.  Danny remembers.  And we were questioning the video.  Well, we got Mike.  Mike from New York.  Was that your video, Mike?  Yeah, it was.  How do we know?  You can check my number.  It's on our website.  Phone number.  So you're trying to get an energy drink thing happening, right?  You got a new energy drink.  We're thinking that the fucking video was set up.  What?  Was the video real or was it not real?  Oh, 100% real. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah?  Actually, I thought my dad was going to freak out.  My mom, I've never seen her freak out like that.  She lost her fucking mind, dude.  Just because you had cases of the energy drink all over the house.  Yeah, she's a psychologist.  And she's actually, she always tells us my dad is like semi-autistic.  And so we thought he was going to flip out about his hats being on the ground.  His hats being on the ground?  Look at his hats.  Looks like a bunch of people just stepped out of an elevator in the Bronx. 
[02:12:30]  Wow.  Your mom handled it really well.  My mom didn't freak out like that when she caught me blowing somebody when I was six.  It's like that.  It's been hard to keep it up.  She keeps asking me to take it down.  Really?  Yeah.  Actually, like three weeks ago, she told me I could put it up.  And then I put it up and she found out at work from a co-worker.  She didn't talk to me for two days.  Yeah, but I'm confused, man.  You're starting a new company, obviously.  You got this video of your mom freaking out.  But it's getting some attention. 
[02:13:00]  It got our attention, certainly.  And more and more people are checking out the video.  Why would she want it taken down if this is good for you and good for your business?  That's what I'm trying to explain to her.  But as you can see from the video, it's a little hard to deal with her if she's freaking out.  Yeah, apparently it's very hard to be rational.  She's screaming like she's calling 911 and she's looking at a murder scene.  Yeah, and once she was first dialing, she actually dialed me. 
[02:13:30]  And she left me a voicemail and then the phone starts beeping.  So a lot of people are commenting, oh, the phone's beeping.  It's fake or something.  But it's the other phone.  So you're here to say that this video is not fake.  Yeah.  It's what?  It's real.  Yeah, 100% real.  All right.  I'm speaking French today.  Well, there you go.  Good luck with the drink.  God bless.  Yeah, thanks, man.  Appreciate it.  What's the name of the drink?  What the hell?  We'll help you out a little bit.  Vital Energy.  And the video was Epic Nervous Breakdown Caused by Vital Energy.  All right.  Very good. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  You're saying it's real.  Are you a fan of the show or did someone tell you that we were talking about it?  Oh, no.  Someone told me, actually.  My coworker or business partner listens to you guys.  I used to listen to you a year ago when I was in Michigan, but I had to cancel my accent.  Fascinating.  Yeah.  All right.  Godspeed.  All right.  You guys really could give a shit about Mike.  Yeah, I could give a shit about him.  Why am I giving a shit about him when we have a beautiful girl out here?  All right.  My God.  Enjoy your drink.  Run fast after having some.  Hot chick in.  Good.  Hot chick in. 
[02:14:30]  Come here.  Come here.  Come here, sweetie.  I'm right here.  Sugary beverage out.  Hot chick in.  All right, Mike.  Your timing is just bad, unfortunately, because we do have Taylor Vixen.  You can sit right here.  The penthouse pet of the year.  Aw.  Hi, Taylor.  How are you?  I'm good.  Put your bag down.  Well, look at you.  Oh, Jimmy.  Shut up, Jimmy.  My name's Tim.  I'm Jim.  Oh, wait.  You guys never met.  We have not.  Don't give her a chair, you cock blocker.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's a good move, E-Rock.  Oh, there we go.  Wait, wait.  Oh, there we go.  Look at this. 
[02:15:00]  That's much better.  How have you been?  Me?  I'm good.  How's your night?  I'm really tired.  Oh, yeah?  Uh-huh.  I am.  Yeah.  I am.  Taylor, can I ask you?  Because I want to hear.  Okay.  Oh, she needs headphones.  Fuck.  Stupid places set up like shit.  I know.  How is a man supposed to have a girl on his lap?  I know.  So you went out with, you picked a great restaurant, by the way.  Yeah.  Now, when you got there and you saw Anthony and, what kind of a date is Anthony? 
[02:15:30]  Because I think he's much nicer than people think he is.  Well, first of all, I had a million texts this morning overhearing whatever y'all were  talking about.  I know.  We were just discussing the date.  We were very respectful.  We certainly were.  People like drawing their own conclusions.  Yeah, yeah.  They like to exaggerate out there.  They certainly do.  Twitter was interesting.  Why did you pick the Brazilian meat house for a date with Anthony?  Well, I'm from Texas and we love meat there. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  And I love Fogo de Chao.  What is that?  It is a Brazilian steakhouse.  There's actually not one here in the city.  We figured that out.  And I think it's better still.  It's great.  Yeah.  Have you been there?  Many times.  It's got one of the...  When Anthony told me where he was going, it's one of the cleanest ratings in New York.  It's like as far as being a hygienic place to eat.  It's phenomenal.  And they have them in Rio.  I was in Rio.  Wait, which one?  The one you guys went to.  Oh, I'm talking about it.  No, she's saying the other one's still better. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, okay.  I've not been to that one, but the other one I've been to.  I have to say it was really good.  No, it was really good.  Yeah, they just keep bringing the meat.  Yeah.  And the desserts are delicious.  They have them in Brazil.  We didn't have any dessert.  No?  We filled up so much on stupid meat.  Lots of meat.  How much meat did you have, Taylor?  I don't know.  Enough.  Good enough.  You were saying no thanks a lot, too.  We were all saying no thanks, but Anthony sure likes his meat.  Yeah.  Because he was like, yes, please.  Yes, please. 
[02:17:00]  Meat, please.  Meat, please.  Was he being sweet, Anthony?  Because I like when he's sweet, Anthony.  He likes sweet, Anthony.  I like sweet, Anthony.  He was sweet.  We had so much fun.  We did.  I think we laughed the whole time.  I know.  We really did have a good time.  Lots of stories.  Yeah, yeah.  See, we were telling a lot of nice, fun stories.  Just laughing.  Like Crazy the Gun Story.  Of course.  I loved the gun stories.  Who had the gun story?  Stories about people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  A couple of those.  I'm sure Anthony recommended a website for you.  You might want to.  He didn't.  No, see, I didn't bring up any of that.  No websites.  There's only one great website to go to, and that's Taylor's.  Yeah, it's mine.  Taylor Rickson.  So was Anthony nicer than you thought he'd be?  Tell the truth, because he's a radio shock jock, quote unquote.  Yes, and okay, he had more of a personality than I thought, but I bet you thought the same  about me.  Yes, I totally did.  You know, you get your preconceived notions that it's going to be a girl from Penthouse 
[02:18:00]  and she's just going to be, you know.  And I knew when you were in here the other day that, you know, you had a little more going  on than just that.  But then you go out and hang out and talk and you realize, yeah, girls, you know, cool.  She's got something, she's got a little brain.  She's like a real girl, you know.  It's not just a very extremely hot girl.  It was.  You had your friend come.  Was that just in case he was a creep?  Let's be honest.  He's a nice guy, but you never know, right? 
[02:18:30]  But it's like you really don't know anybody.  And honestly, I'm a big, I'm like more the merrier in general, like going out.  I love people.  I love, ooh, yeah.  That's a good thing.  I like that.  And it just brings more conversation.  It brings more getting to know other people.  She lives in Jersey.  She's from Dallas.  Cute girl.  Why not bring it?  I'm, you know, I'm pimping her out too.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  She was pimping her out.  It's nice that Selfish didn't think to bring one of his friends.  Hey, he's only working on himself, I think. 
[02:19:00]  I don't have, I don't have friends.  I would have been happy just to be, just to leave you two alone, and I would have just  talked to your attractive friend.  See, that would have been nice, see?  She would have probably been like, why?  I'm just kidding.  What are you, what are you doing?  No, she probably would have been like that, but I'm a very good conversationalist.  She's a really cool chick.  Now, you're, you're going to be going back to Los Angeles.  Yes, I leave tomorrow.  I miss home so much.  I've been here since last Wednesday.  Yeah.  I like L.A.  I do.  The weather, much better. 
[02:19:30]  We're, um, not as crowded.  Yeah.  This place is so crowded.  I noticed something.  You guys are back to small talk.  What happened?  Well, we're in a room with you fucking idiots.  They're back to small talking.  Well, what are you going to say?  They're talking about the weather.  No.  We want to know what happened last night.  Carly just texted me and said, thank you, Anthony.  You're such a sweetie for last night.  Oh, see.  I was being sweetie.  Carly, her name is?  Yes, her name's Carly.  You had to pick up her meat bill.  Everyone's meat bill.  Where does Carly live?  She lives in New Jersey?  Yes. 
[02:20:00]  What, what, what parks?  I grew up in New Jersey.  Um, am I saying this right?  Brunswick or something?  Brunswick?  Brunswick.  I grew up in North Brunswick.  She's been living there for about five years.  It's North of Brunswick.  No, no, no.  There's North Brunswick, East Brunswick, South Brunswick, and New Brunswick.  Shut up.  New Brunswick is where we're all like, live.  Now, when you're in L.A., um, let's say I had reason to go to Los Angeles.  Let's say there was a trial, something to do with Phil Spector, file trading with Gary Glitter. 
[02:20:30]  I would take you to Fogote Chow.  Would you?  Yes.  All right.  You know, if this room feels so much cleaner, it's different.  Patrice isn't here.  Oh, damn.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Like, it's so weird.  Patrice was here and just did nothing but give her a hard time trying to pull his Patrice  not interested charm on her, and it was failing miserably.  It didn't work, huh?  No, no.  You know that Patrice, like, I don't give a shit.  Fuck that bitch.  You got this and this. 
[02:21:00]  I don't like that.  That's Patrice.  And he thinks the girls are just going to claw onto him, and that's his technique.  And it didn't work.  Are you saying his reverse psychology didn't work?  Exactly.  Exactly.  That might work with his bitches.  But I love to see all the flaws he has to point out about me.  That was fun.  He's blind.  Yeah, we were right.  It was great.  I loved it.  Tell him to go fuck himself.  Everyone's got flaws.  I mean, you know, hot chicks have them.  Well, we all have them.  Believe it or not, I have a few physical flaws, too. 
[02:21:30]  They're not apparent to the eye, though.  Yeah, I can't really see any flaws.  You look perfect.  Jimmy is just a sweet, sweet boy.  Taylor, are you hungover today?  You got the big Hollywood glasses on.  Because my eyes are like a little red.  I'm just really tired.  Can we see?  Yeah, can we see your eyes red?  Can we see your beautiful eyes?  Those are good martinis.  Oh, look.  Is that?  No, not at all.  Okay.  You look, you do.  Look, she looks very, very girl next door.  Very, uh...  I know.  Very like a...  That's why I love that look.  It's really nice.  I am very girl next door.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  How did you... 
[02:22:00]  I'm sure these guys covered this, but how did you come to Pose in Penthouse?  Did you do other stuff before, or is it like...  I did, like, two other things before, but I just kind of sent my pictures in.  I got bored one day.  I know it sounds weird.  Did it...  Was a boyfriend or whatever at the time take a picture?  Because I've had girls that would let me and girls that would not let me take photos  of them.  Were you dating someone who was like, oh, you're not going to get fired up?  Well, obviously, I had to send something in, right?  So, at the time, I had someone take pictures for me, like, just raw shots, you know, to send in.  And, yeah, that person was like, you look great. 
[02:22:30]  You should do it.  Just someone I was dating.  Okay.  He's old hat now.  He's gone.  Yeah.  We're friends.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we're always friends.  I'm great with that.  I'm friends with everyone.  Yeah, what are you going to know?  I'm not psycho, so...  I want to know more about last night.  What do you want to know?  Last night.  Just because we got your side of the story.  You're a busy body.  You're a busy body.  You brought it to everyone's attention out there, so I've got to do my job.  I mean, we got Anthony's side of the date.  He really liked it. 
[02:23:00]  He really had a lot of fun, a lot of drinking, a lot of meat-eating, a lot of laughing.  What else you said?  A lot of racism.  Lots of laughing.  Basically, at one point at the end of the night, we were just laughing at all what the people  on Twitter were saying.  Yeah, there was a lot of tweeting.  About, hey, your daughter looks great.  That was a good one.  See, this is what we want to get into.  And then one of them said, Taylor, Anthony has AIDS.  That's a nice cock-blocking asshole. 
[02:23:30]  That's not what I meant.  Don't get in the back of the van with him.  I mean, it was just like...  Help me out with this couch, would you?  Well, I was telling him that before I got there, I go, my Twitter completely went the  opposite way.  Like, every tweet is about Anthony.  I'm like, these guys, these guys love Anthony.  Yes.  Because they are like, and this, and this, and this.  They live vicariously through me.  So, you know, to go out with the penthouse pet of the year.  We have some great pictures that I couldn't...  I didn't have my reader to upload last night. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  But we have some great pictures that I'm going to send.  Yeah, send me the pictures and I'll pop them up.  Because I think some faces have to be digitized out.  Yes, we got arrested.  Yeah, yeah.  It was close.  Yeah.  There was some police involved, so...  You'll see the pictures.  Leave it at that.  Oh, okay.  We'll just leave it at that.  Their faces have to be...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But Anthony got us out of it.  Thank goodness.  Yeah.  Well, you got arrested?  I'm pretty good with that.  Yeah.  I get arrested every day.  Come on.  We were...  Oh, no.  Are you a bit of a troublemaker?  When I was younger, yes. 
[02:24:30]  No?  I was really bad.  I was always in grounded.  My grounded, like, overlapped each other.  But I mean when you go out, like, when you drink a little bit, are you kind of like a  fight starter?  No.  Okay.  I'm a happy drunk.  Oh, she's all good.  Okay.  Yeah.  She gets very happy and fun.  Very happy.  And, yeah, the police got involved.  There was kind of a...  Wait, there was really a...  A public...  We...  Yes.  There was a little public display going on.  Carly didn't get arrested, so...  No, no.  Wait, what happened?  Did Carly...  Let's just say...  What can you say about this?  Did Carly... 
[02:25:00]  I can't really talk about it.  Uh, no.  We saw some pictures, though.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Do you have them?  Wait, who got arrested?  I can't show them.  We didn't get arrested.  We came close.  Wow.  We were hanging out outside.  For what reason?  Well, there was some shenanigans going on.  Yeah.  It was...  We have pictures.  Yeah.  It's kind of like, you know, the movie thing.  Wait, was there a little...  Was there a little kisser?  A little kisser?  It was just...  There was...  No.  No.  No.  Nothing like that.  It was, you know... 
[02:25:30]  No.  Donkey show.  Yeah.  What do you...  It was, you know...  You gotta give us something.  Tell her.  Give us something.  We were doing show and tell.  Were you show...  Ah.  Were you showin'?  We were doing show and tell.  Were you show in old school?  And, uh...  Anthony was running down the aisle...  The aisle.  What am I saying?  Anthony was running down the alley, flinging his dick out.  And I was like, Anthony, stop running down the alleys, flinging your dick out.  It was, you know, one of those, you show me yours, I'll show you mine.  And the cops showed up and it was, uh, kind of a... 
[02:26:00]  You know, it happens.  And, um, yeah.  Somehow I got involved.  I don't know.  Yeah, I know.  But, you know, I got a couple of connections and...  He does.  Thank goodness.  Things were settled.  That's great.  Yeah.  What are you gonna do?  I love you show me yours, I'll show you mine.  It's so much fun.  I love that.  It felt like a kindergarten.  You know.  Right.  Yeah.  That's why I got fired.  Oh, Paul.  All right.  So I didn't know that part.  Anthony, uh...  Yeah, he liked that out.  But all around, it was a great night. 
[02:26:30]  Yes!  Would you date Anthony again?  Would you go out with him for dinner again at one point?  He's a nice guy.  Maybe when I come back into town.  Yeah, I'm thinking, uh, when you come back.  He wants to get you in a bikini.  Well, who doesn't?  Oh, I'm just saying.  Oh, Google it.  I'd love to see that at the...  Yeah, I'm just Googling.  No, I would love to, uh, see her, uh, poolside.  That'd be wonderful.  Yeah, that'd be all right.  Yeah.  Anthony's house.  I'll have to drag you out to the, the, the compound mansion.  The compound just sounds scary.  Sounds like I'm going to the compound in Waco, Texas. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, I know, but it's not.  You really gotta change the name of the place, Ant.  She's right.  It's a fun compound.  It doesn't look like a compound.  It's just a...  Reminds me of that place in Waco.  Remember that?  Yes.  Well, it probably would.  No.  Yes.  It's kind of like that with more radical thinking.  You asshole.  It's actually an extraordinary gentleman's house.  You would never think that it belongs to a guy who's very naughty on the radio.  Well, he talked about his, um, the guy got really decorated.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was talking about that.  Yeah, see, um, uh, Ange came in and decorated everything because I had nothing and decorated 
[02:27:30]  the house and did a great job.  And, uh, I think you'd love it.  So next time you're in town, maybe we could have dinner and, uh, pop by there.  We'll all go for a swim.  And the pool will be heated.  I love a nice heated pool.  Mm.  So it's, uh...  Just don't go into the jacuzzi because that tends to not be heated.  Shut up.  It is too.  I know how it works now.  Jimmy was making fun of my gazpacho soup jacuzzi.  Yeah, I went in there once and it was fucking like minus eight and the pool was all hot.  My little testicle shriveled in the jacuzzi.  I was just trying to be a stud. 
[02:28:00]  It didn't work out for you?  Jacuzzis are the best.  Yeah, Anthony's place is it.  But you can go, this is the theme of Anthony's house.  You can go to Anthony's house without feeling there's going to be pressure for sex because  it's like a massive place.  Of course.  It's sprawling.  There are plenty of rooms.  Anthony's harmless.  He is, right?  That's it.  See?  I'm harmless.  Yeah.  And fun, right?  Harmless, fun, has connections to get us out of getting arrested.  Yeah.  Jesus.  See?  That's everything.  How close were you?  Like, let's just say that.  How was it?  Was it a case of it was going to happen or were you kind of close? 
[02:28:30]  We were against the car.  It was close, but Anthony's like, you know, saying all this stuff.  I said enough.  That got us out of a situation.  And I, you know, popped out a centerfold.  I did what I could do.  Yeah, yeah.  You showed who she was.  Let a boot pop out or something.  Yeah.  To distract the cops.  But who called them?  I think it was just a lapse in judgment and somebody seeing that shouldn't have been there. 
[02:29:00]  Wrong place, wrong time.  Okay.  You know.  Sure, sure.  You see that happen all the time on cops.  There's a lot of vigory going on right now.  A lot of vigory.  Vagory is understandable.  I don't even know if that's a word, but I'll use it.  Vaping it a little vague so no one gets in trouble or anything.  What part of the city this happened?  What part of the city was it?  It was meatpacking.  Oh, okay.  Meatpacking.  Meatpacking district there.  You've got to watch it down there, though, because there's a lot of stuff that goes on that's not exactly wholesome.  I thought meatpacking would be fine.  You know.  Yeah.  It's not like you're a mid-testing. 
[02:29:30]  He was trying to really meatpack.  Yeah.  Was him making the moves on you, Taylor?  I told you he's nice.  Did he attempt a couple moves?  Come on.  I'm extremely nice.  You'll never see me.  No.  Let's get into this.  I will see him again.  First date.  No, he was very sweet.  What was his move, though?  I don't know.  It was not a move.  Did he go in for a kiss?  I don't think he knows.  No.  I don't do a move.  Did he do the thing where he yawns and puts his arm around you?  That's a good one in the movie theater?  No.  He's so nice.  He took a nice picture.  Did he rub his engorged cock on your fucking leg? 
[02:30:00]  Shut up.  That's how I actually...  It made it look like it was by accident.  Does that turn you on about Anthony's cock?  Absolutely.  Oh, damn.  Did he press up against you and go, oh, sorry, I didn't really mean to do that.  Does he do that to you a lot?  Yeah, he does.  Does it to all of us?  Yeah.  We all pretend we don't like it.  Right.  I bet you have to have it.  But we do.  If we didn't like it, we didn't do it.  What was his move, though?  He had to have a little move.  His move is being nice and smooth. 
[02:30:30]  I think that's his move.  Thank you.  It really is.  If you have someone that's like, I want to fuck you, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, no.  We're not saying that it was like that, I think.  Yeah.  That's too much.  But there was something in between, I'm thinking.  His move was making sure we were taken care of, making sure that, you know, oh, the bar  closed, right?  Yes.  And they're like, we're not serving drinks out here anymore.  And Anthony's like, well, we need drinks.  So you went inside and got him and brought him outside?  Yeah.  See?  So we could still hang out outside for a little while longer. 
[02:31:00]  He made the night go.  Yeah.  You know, you never want people wanting for something.  Right.  You know, or standing around or waiting for things.  No waiting.  No waiting was involved.  Yeah.  Anthony's a good date, I would think.  Oh, thank you, Jimmy.  He's my friend.  We had a great, we basically had like a threesome date.  Yeah, it was wonderful.  We should do a double bond.  You brought another hot girl.  That was perfect.  Listen, we should do a double date.  It's about time I got involved with the situation.  Really?  You want to get involved in this, Jimmy?  I do.  You want to get involved with this double date thing? 
[02:31:30]  I do.  I'm fun on a date.  I just point out crime statistics.  Who are you going to bring, though, Jimmy?  What's that?  Who are you going to bring on the double date?  I would allow my friends to pick a friend for me.  Oh.  Well, that's nice.  Sure.  Yes.  Unless my girlfriend wanted to come.  In which case, I would bring her.  That could be an issue.  That could be nice, right?  Bringing your girlfriend on the double date?  I would, actually.  I would bring my girlfriend.  Would that make sense?  Sure.  I would.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's nice.  I would probably go for her, too.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Taylor likes girls.  Oh, you like...  Yeah.  Yeah?  She likes girls.  Yes.  You like girls.  Do you prefer them, or do you prefer them, or do you prefer them?  You know, since I work with girls a lot, I prefer guys.  Yes, but I prefer girls.  It's just like, you know, it's work more now.  Do you do video at all, like any of the soft...  Video girls.  You do soft or hardcore?  Hardcore girls.  Oh, you do?  Wow, okay.  Nice.  She's wearing a big coat today.  And it's not a big coat.  It's a nice...  It's a big coat. 
[02:32:30]  It actually feels good in here, so I can take my coat off.  Yeah, take your coat off, because Jimmy wasn't here the other day.  It was some terrific stuff going on.  I have seen your photos.  You're very lovely, if I might.  Yes.  Holy mackerel.  Yeah, see that, Jimmy?  That's very nice.  You see?  My God.  Got a nice Huawei, nice t-shirt on.  Ugh.  And people were yelling and screaming, because I put a video up, and they're saying those  are not real.  They're real.  Stop it.  They're totally fucking real.  They're totally real.  Out of your mind.  I'm holding my water bottle.  Is this a giveaway? 
[02:33:00]  If you take your jacket out, I go...  I came closer.  Yes, they're real.  And I don't know.  A lot of people, like...  You know, I show up to shoots all the time, and the photographer, like, okay, now bra.  And he's like, are your boobs real?  And I'm like, yes.  They shoot girls every day.  They do it every...  I get it pretty much every time.  They hurt your back?  Yes.  See if I sit up straight.  Wow.  Yeah.  I work for unsexyquestions.com. 
[02:33:30]  What an asshole I am.  Do they hurt your back?  Yes.  Really, dude?  What's up?  I don't really have a fucking...  She's 26, 27.  That's not a question you ask a 26-year-old with big boobs.  I know, but why would I think...  You know, that's what I think of it.  That's how fucking...  What an older man I'm becoming.  Yeah.  I see big bosoms.  That must be painful, dear.  And they're very perky.  Huh?  But they're...  I would never give them up.  Don't hurt my back forever.  You got another question for her, Jimmy?  Another unsexy question about her boobs?  Go for it.  No, he's got another one.  You got another one about her boobs.  No, that was the only one. 
[02:34:00]  That was it?  I think of one, yeah.  Okay.  I don't think...  I think of anything.  Would you like to see her in a bra?  I really like you, so I want to show you my boobs since you weren't here the other day.  Oh, wow.  I think you deserve that.  How nice would that be?  There we go.  If you would like to.  I'll pop that up.  I'll be nice, guy.  Well, I'm just going to pull my shirt up because I want to show you because you weren't here.  And I really like you.  Thank you.  Cock blocker, Jimmy.  No!  Just kidding.  Look at that.  That's stunning.  Wow.  Yeah.  I want to say heavens to murgatory. 
[02:34:30]  Do they look fake to you?  Heavens to murgatory.  No.  They don't look fake.  No.  They're real.  Yeah.  I think it's good if they look real.  They really are.  Yeah, they look completely real.  They're not looking at you anymore, though.  No, because I just.  Look at me in the eyes.  Always look at eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wax on.  Common pants.  But no, it's, you know, I feel like, you know, she wanted to.  I think that she wanted to show me.  I think she wanted to show Anthony.  No, no, no, no.  Well, I was showing them the other day, but you weren't here, and you missed out. 
[02:35:00]  You were supposed to be here, right?  I, what, did I have to shoot, or was I flying home?  I think you were flying home.  What day were you here?  It was, what is the day before yesterday?  No.  Yesterday.  Last week.  Last week.  Friday.  Yeah, it was Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Last Friday.  Where was I?  Not here, Jimmy.  I think you were filming or something.  Oh, you know why?  I shot, I had a night shoot, and then I slept that morning, because I had fucking shot until  six o'clock.  Oh.  Now, I hear we got to get you out of here, right? 
[02:35:30]  You have to leave at nine.  Well, that's what they told us.  I don't know if it's true or not.  I've got stuff to do.  I've got a good time.  I have a car, that's why.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I'm going to, I have to get ready for a convention I'm doing.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Some signings?  I, uh, it's for the Parts Authority.  I'm not sure exactly.  The Parts Authority?  No, let me look.  She just shows up.  She's just got to show up and look sexy.  I'm doing a convention for, it's not, not, um, work related.  It's like just, um, we're a bunch of guys do this convention thing, and they want pretty 
[02:36:00]  girls, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  So I meet, I do signing, stuff like that, yeah.  It's kind of like you mingle and chit-chat sometimes, right?  Yeah, which I love doing, so it's perfect.  Yeah, it's kind of like, because there's nothing worse, even though you know you're not going  to be able to sleep with the models.  It just sucks.  It's just a bunch of guys, like at a car show.  Yeah.  A bunch of fucking dopey swinging dicks.  It's nice to have some eye candy.  Absolutely, yeah.  Yeah.  That's, I, how creepy would it be if Anthony just showed up and just looked in the window  and stared the whole time. 
[02:36:30]  Hey!  Yeah.  Oh my God.  I kept knocking on the, kept knocking on the windows.  That would just be so fucking creepy.  That would be pretty creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's like, I don't have that image in my head.  Yeah.  But he's very, uh.  Anytime I look at a window, he'll be like, what the fuck is he?  But he's so sweet.  Is he there?  He's a very laid-by.  Yeah.  Notice how I want to look cool, so I put my fucking 1986 Ray-Bans out.  That's good.  Always let the chicks see your sunglasses.  And shoes.  Yeah, no, I have some fucking great Nike sneakers, but I suspect I stepped in shit, by the way, 
[02:37:00]  because something is not copacetic with these shoes, so my apologies, yeah.  There's something, something happening.  Are you reeking?  That's not the shit smell, right?  It's not shit.  Do you smell something?  No.  Okay.  You want Iraq to smell your shoes today?  I actually would, yeah.  I don't think it's shit.  They don't smell the bottom of your shoes.  Yeah.  You want to take a break?  You tell her you're hanging around, or what?  You hang for a little bit?  Uh.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Okay.  A little bit.  She's got her car, yeah.  We didn't get anything done with her.  I want to know what happened last night.  We told you everything.  There might have been some kind of arrest thing. 
[02:37:30]  Told you everything that needs to be told.  Very vague.  That's the way.  On the cops' involvement.  Don't worry.  On the date.  I just say this.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Turned into a felony.  I like, that's why I like it.  You guys had a nice date that turned into an almost felony that was drinking and fucking  eating.  Yeah.  It's always a good time eating meat, drinking, and yeah, almost a felony.  Nice.  That's a successful date.  See, the thing is, is I want to see a relationship bloom.  Not necessarily a marriage or a boyfriend-girlfriend, but just a casual dating relationship. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  It could be an occasional once a month.  I could see you occasionally hanging out.  Hanging out.  Going to, but as long as, you know, you could, I mean.  You're like matchmaker over here, aren't you?  No, but I just, you know, Anthony is, I want to see Anthony happy, and of course.  I know you probably run into a lot of creepy guys, and Anthony's a brilliant, funny guy.  Thank you, James.  It's a big, nice house.  Anthony's a blast.  And you also have really hot friends that you could introduce me to.  So let's be honest.  That's who it's about.  It's about me.  It really is about you. 
[02:38:30]  It's not about my friend or his happiness or fuck his brilliance.  It's all about your friends and how they'll be jealous that you have a guy who has a  great house.  We'll get together when you come back in June.  For sure.  I'll be back.  All right, good.  Why don't we, we'll take a break, and maybe Taylor Vixen will be here.  If not, Taylor Vixen, one word on Twitter.  Yes.  Thank you, guys.  Join her Twitter.  Yes.  Opian Anthony.  And talk about Anthony all day.  It's time for Open Day Q&A.  On a recent episode of the Opian Anthony Show, penthouse pet Taylor Vixen stopped by and 
[02:39:00]  showed the show host a picture of her asshole.  After looking at the picture, what did comedian Patrice O'Neill claim to find  in her turd cutter?  Was it A, a hemorrhoid, B, a doody, or C, some cum?  The answer in moments.  The Opian Anthony Show, 6 to 11 a.m. Eastern, on the virus. 
[02:39:30]  Sirius XM.  I'm Allie from Orlando, and I was jogging by a construction site and noticed a wow sticker  on a toolbox.  So, I showed my jugs, and they redid my entire patio in free of charge.  Thank you, Opian Anthony.  I'm Cindy from Dallas, Texas.  I noticed a wow sticker in my boss's office, so I took a chance and I flashed him.  Now, I'm the VP of marketing.  My husband is so proud.  Thank you, O&A.  I'm Margo from New Jersey.  I was driving down I-70, and I saw an Opian Anthony wow sticker. 
[02:40:00]  So, I flashed this random guy, and he followed me 65 miles to my house.  And now, we're engaged.  Thanks, O&A.  It worked for them, and it could work for you ladies.  If you see a wow sticker, take a chance and show your breasts.  We're going through the video that's up online now of Jimmy. 
[02:40:30]  Jimmy, earlier in the show, we had, um, Jesus Christ, let's go.  BJ Penn from the UFC.  And he was in here, uh, great interview, by the way. 
[02:41:00]  I had a lot of fun with him.  And Jimmy wanted him to put him in an arm bar, but not apply any real pressure to it.  Just show him the technique behind it.  And he did, and, uh, kind of pulled very minimally on Jim's arm after he locked him in.  But we're watching the video, the whole process of him locking it in, putting his ankle across your neck and chest and your waist area, and pulling your arm. 
[02:41:30]  We're watching frame by frame.  Your fucking faces are hysterical.  This is a video to watch frame by frame.  Oh, yeah.  Slow it down.  Like, every face that Jimmy's making.  Especially when he comes out of it.  Like, the second Jimmy tapped the guy's ankle, uh, BJ's ankle, uh, Jimmy just starts this face like,  Wow!  And his eyes get all big.  Oh, it's fucking classic.  Where can people see this? 
[02:42:00]  Well, I'll, uh, I'll link the video on my Twitter, OP Radio, but it's on my YouTube channel right now, OP Radio, same fucking thing.  So, uh, God damn it, Jimmy.  God bless you.  That's your new bit, by the way.  I would do that with any of them.  I would love to.  With every UFC fighter, you gotta do a little, uh, you gotta...  I won't get choked, just because we've seen that done already, and it's also, uh...  The choking's not fun.  I had that done by a wrestler.  Oh, God.  It's not fun.  I can't imagine a UFC guy doing this.  You tapped his little sock.  You tapped his sock. 
[02:42:30]  Hello, thank you.  You're ripping my arm off.  Right after I daintily tapped his sock.  Your headphones go flying.  Wow!  Oh, beautiful, Jimmy.  I'm twittering photos of my fucking awful face.  Yeah, yeah, Jimmy just took pictures of, uh, some of the still frames, and, uh,  um, god damn.  He looks...  He's making a face like he's putting a lot of pressure on you, by the way.  He wasn't.  He could have, but he was, you know, he was being gentle. 
[02:43:00]  And he did it, we talked about it earlier, from his chair.  He did that sitting in a chair.  Relaxing.  He was relaxing, and he could have ripped your arm out of its socket, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I'm just cracking up at, uh, Jim's reaction.  It was fantastic.  Ow!  He's brutal.  Brutal.  Alright.  There you go.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  What's up?  Uh, I don't know.  What the fuck's going on?  Error.  Of course.  Of course.  Fucking error.  Of course.  What's happening?  It's not working?  What the fuck?  Stupid thing.  Of course there would be an error.  Of course.  That's a great fucking photo to get signed, though.  Being armbarred like that?  Oh my god, yeah.  That's fucking true.  Error on page.  Of course.  Yeah, there...  Now, Sam... 
[02:44:00]  Your eyeballs...  His heel is in your eyeball.  Does Sam have this on video?  Sam has a good copy of this, right?  I think Sam's got it also, yeah.  Yeah.  That's fun.  Everyone...  Like, look at the people looking in the window, just laughing at you.  Stupid Bob Kelly has texted me.  Oh, he did?  What'd he say?  Ah, he's just asking how it went.  So I'm gonna send him a picture of me being fucking armbarred.  Yeah.  This is what you missed, dickhead.  Uh...  Ah, come on, you fuck.  What? 
[02:44:30]  Not working out?  Oh, fucking no, man.  Let's try to see again.  Uh...  All right, I think it's on my Twitter now, the link to the video.  She's very nice, Ant.  Nice girl.  Check it out.  Check out Norton getting armbarred.  Armbarred?  Yeah.  Getting an armbar from BJ Penn from the UFC.  I think I got, um...  Brother Joe's on the line.  A good foundation started there for the next time.  I think you do, too.  With the televixen?  Yeah.  And then, of course, in between now and then...  She does seem like...  There's the texting going on and stuff.  Yeah.  Because it's not just, you know... 
[02:45:00]  I mean, it would be...  It's one of those good, bad things when you get a girl that you could just...  Well, it's very good, especially a girl like that.  If you could just go in there and, you know, just pound right away.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  Oh, your brother's on the line.  But, uh...  Brother Joe!  Some of you got to work.  Yeah, that's worth...  That's worth waiting for.  And eating a whole fucking side of beef.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck staying away from steak when you have that waiting on the other end.  Yeah, you were taking care of your cholesterol until yesterday, huh, Ed?  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  Actually, my doctor said it was really, really good, so I think I wrecked it last night.  You fucked that up.  With the meat.  No, that was good.  I made sure I went down into the bathroom and binged with some of the bulimics down there.  I just lined up in the girls' bathroom and we all vomited.  It was wonderful.  I was actually calling in to make a comment about BJ Penn.  I'm an avid follower of UFC, as you guys know.  Yeah.  Have you guys seen the video of...  Just to give you an idea of how strong this guy is and how hard he trains, 
[02:46:00]  have you ever seen a video of him hopping out of the shallow end of the pool without using any hand?  Yeah, we watched that earlier when he was on.  To even do something like that is...  How the fuck do you do that?  It's amazing because he's only 5'9".  I say only, but I would imagine taller guys would have an easier time with that.  I mean, I can't imagine how he did that.  He's shoulder deep when he does it.  He bends his legs until his shoulders are under the water and just jumps out. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  That way, standing upright, he was almost chest deep in the water.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he's not a tall guy, but...  Yeah, Jimmy got put in an arm bar.  It was fucking hysterical.  You got to see the video.  I'm going to go check it out.  Yeah, it's really cool.  Well, then down to AC, I'm doing another tournament.  That was the worst bad beat I ever took in my life the other night, Amp.  You witnessed it.  Oh, right.  Yeah, you got fucking beat.  What happened there?  Tell everybody...  I had Ace Queen.  Ace came up.  Ended up with an all-in. 
[02:47:00]  The guy had Ace King.  It just sucked.  Yeah.  It sucked.  I got caught.  That kicker sucked.  Yeah, you ran out of that fucking place.  Oh, I not only ran out, but I kept going.  I got in my car and left.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought you were going to go back up to...  I thought Joe was going back up to the room.  He's like, yeah, I'm fucking done.  I'm going to, you know...  I go, all right.  There's room upstairs, you know, in the suite, taking a fucking nap, whatever you want to do.  He's like, yeah, cool.  And then I get a text.  Fuck this.  I'm getting the fuck out of here.  I'm driving.  Oh, God.  He got a bad beat that just fucking put him right in his vehicle. 
[02:47:30]  And where am I going now?  I'm going down to play a tournament at the Borgata.  Of course.  Maybe we'll make it back today.  All right, man.  Have fun.  All right, Joey.  I'll talk to you, man.  Brother Joe.  I didn't know Brother Joe made the big AC trip.  Yeah, he was actually playing at Harrah's with 2U.  I didn't see it because I was gambling, but when he was done, he came over to the Borgata  and hung out for some poker.  But I got beat bad in poker, too.  Oh, you did poker down there, too?  Yeah.  If I'm really getting fucked playing blackjack, I'll take a breather and go into the poker 
[02:48:00]  room and play poker because, you know, you just shell out a certain amount of money.  You're not going to lose more than you have sitting there.  You can chill a little bit.  You're not betting huge amounts.  Exactly.  You can regroup by getting into a good poker game.  You take a break.  You just play some poker.  And then you get back to the trenches of blackjack, which I did.  But, yeah, Joe showed up.  But, yeah, he got a bad beat on a guy from a guy.  The guy's just brought in something. 
[02:48:30]  I don't know what this is.  I guess I'm just going to play it.  What?  Will it make sense, Dane, just to play it?  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  So do you get, you know, do you get people trying you wherever you go?  Like, you know, you can go from, like, which is what I was surprised at.  Like, so what happens?  Like, was there a point in that fight where you were, like, had you trained enough for  the, I mean, like, did you find that at all?  Like, you know, like, what was the first thing?  Like, I think to take a champion's belt, I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like, he seemed like he wanted to really, like, have you ever had a guy in the ring that 
[02:49:00]  you wanted to?  Because that went, like, you know, like, how do you feel?  Like, because there was, you know, you come from a pretty much, like, what motivated you  to fight?  That to me is almost more impressive.  Like, did you want to retire at any point?  Like, and all of a sudden you're like, I was amazed to read this too.  Like, what is the, what, oh, you got to go?  Thanks for coming in, man.  We're happy to have you.  Oh, that was great.  Holy shit.  Crushingly good.  I meant my interviewing skills. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, of course.  That was very funny.  Who picked up on that?  Because I'm sitting here.  D-boy?  Jimmy usually.  Fucking D-boy.  I knew it.  Jimmy takes the lead on these UFC interviews, and I'm sitting here going, wow, Jimmy's  doing a really good job interviewing BJ Penn.  I didn't even pick up on the like thing.  He was doing a great job.  But fucking D-boy heard that with his D-boy senses.  He's like Spidey.  You know what?  We rarely play something, you know, twice in a row.  I got to hear that again.  But you know what?  We have to do it again. 
[02:50:00]  We have to do it again.  That is so fucking funny.  We have to do it again.  That is a great clip.  So do you get, you know, do you get people trying you wherever you go?  Like, you know, he can go from like, uh, which is what I was surprised at.  Like, so what happens?  Like, was there a point in that fight where you were like, had you trained enough for  the, I mean, like, did you find that at all?  Like, you know, like, what was the first thing?  Like, um, I think to take a champion's belt, I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like, he seemed like he wanted to really, like, have you ever had a guy in the ring  that you wanted to?  Because that went like, you know, like, how do you feel?  Like, because there was a, you know, you come from a pretty much like, what motivated you 
[02:50:30]  to fight?  Like, that's to me, that to me is almost more impressive.  Like, did you want to retire at any point?  Like, uh, and all of a sudden you're like, I was amazed to read this too.  Like, uh, what is the, uh, what are you going to go?  Thanks for coming in, man.  We're happy to have you.  That's the best part.  The ending is killer.  The best part.  It's fucking funny all the way through.  And then the ending is fucking killer.  I'm just, God damn.  Right on.  Good job, D-Boy.  The slow class for D-Boy.  D-Boy!  God damn that fucking Lionsgate hating cunt. 
[02:51:00]  And how about a hand for me for being incompetent?  Yes, absolutely, James.  That was great.  Oh my God.  God damn, that's funny.  What a boob I am.  What a fucking...  Someone said they counted 27 likes.  Oh, did I say like a lot?  Is that what that was?  Yeah, there was a lot of likes.  Are you kidding?  No, I thought it was just me babbling.  I think it beeps right after you say like in every...  No, listen.  Oh, is that...  I swear to God.  What do you think we're doing?  Dude, look.  Now we got to play it again. 
[02:51:30]  Now we have to play it again.  Here's why I didn't get it.  Because I have been...  I didn't sleep a wink last night.  I laid in bed for five hours.  I could not sleep.  And the night before, I slept for a couple hours yesterday afternoon.  But I'm going.  I'm probably four hours of sleep in like almost three days.  And I got to go shoot after this.  I'm very tired.  Yeah.  You're a sleepy boy.  I'm sleepy, Jimmy.  You did a great job.  It's taken completely out of context.  I didn't realize they were because of the word like.  I thought it was just because of my fucking meandering, boring, awful voice.  Jimmy, why don't we play it again? 
[02:52:00]  No, I'm here on the replay.  I'm on the replay, kid.  So we can totally appreciate what D-Boy did here.  Okay?  It was all about the likes.  Those motherfuckers...  And the beep is basically acknowledging every like.  So do you get people trying you wherever you go?  Like, you know, he can go from like, uh...  Which is what I was surprised at.  Like, so what happens?  Like, was there a point in that fight where you were like, had you trained enough for the...  I mean, like, because like, like, did you find that at all?  Like, you know, like, what was the first thing?  Like, um, I think to take a champion's belt, I mean, you know what I mean? 
[02:52:30]  It's like, he seemed like he wanted to really...  Like, have you ever had a guy in the ring that you wanted to...  Because that went like, you know, like...  How do you feel?  Like, because there was a...  You know, you come from a pretty much...  Like, what motivated you to fight?  That to me is almost more impressive.  Like, did you want to retire at any point?  Like, uh...  And then all of a sudden you're like...  I was amazed to read this too.  Like, uh...  What is the, uh...  Oh, you gotta go?  Thanks for coming in, man.  We're happy to have you.  Oh, you gotta go?  Thanks for coming in, man.  Have it happy.  Nick in Illinois.  Nick.  Yeah, how you doing, guys? 
[02:53:00]  I gotta tell you, man.  I'm never for you guys leaving early, but you can go home.  You don't even have to come back the rest of the week.  That is hilarious.  It's the funniest thing I have heard in a long time.  And Jimmy should play that on stage.  And he'd get the biggest laughs ever.  It is just so funny.  Isn't it?  I think it's adorable.  It's very endearing.  It was great.  It was wonderful.  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Now I'm gonna try to do my stick.  High like, Peter-like. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  What's up, Peter?  Fucking D-boy nailed it, man.  Every time Jimmy does an interview, I fucking listen to those likes.  It's fucking perfect.  Does he?  I've never noticed that you do the white thing.  We all have our crutches and things.  Yes.  Boy, do we.  I would say that those are prosthetic legs.  All right, Peter.  A lot of people loving the D-boy thing right there.  Good job, Derek.  I do say like a lot, and I fucking hate it.  You know when I noticed I say like a lot? 
[02:54:00]  When I'm writing out, like when I do stuff for Leno, I would have to submit what I was  writing, just so the standards and practices could look at it.  And I would write my jokes, and I realized I would say, and then it's like, and I would  say like a few, like, what am I doing?  I said, it's like a girl.  Would you really?  It's a weakness in speech.  I won't say it anymore.  Yeah, it's a hard, the hardest thing is to try to get rid of a crutch.  I've got a few over there.  Like, um, I just, like, um, I was like, um, I was like, um, like, um. 
[02:54:30]  Hold on.  Let me try something here.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  So do you get, uh, you know, do you get people trying you wherever you go?  Like, you know, he can go for, like, uh, we just want to surprise that, like, so what  happens, like, was there a point in that fight where you were like, had you trained enough  for the, I mean, like, because, like, like, did you find that at all?  Like, you know, like, what was the first thing, like, um, I think to take that champion's  belt, I mean, you know what I mean?  It's like, he seemed like he wanted to really, like, have you ever had a guy in the ring that  you wanted to, because that went, like, you know, like, how do you feel, like, because 
[02:55:00]  there was, uh, you know, you come from a pretty much, like, what motivated you to fight?  That, to me, that, to me, is almost more impressive, like, did you want to retire at  any point, like, uh, and then all of a sudden, you're like, I was amazed to read this, too,  like, uh, what is the, uh, what, oh, you gotta go?  Thanks for coming in, man, we're happy to have you.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  Okay, fuck it, what's next?  Oh, I truly am a fucking teenage valley girl.  Oh, shit. 
[02:55:30]  Uh, let's go to Ramone in Maryland.  Ramone.  Yes, sir.  Hello.  Hey, Ramone, what's up, buddy?  Hey, man, what's up, put me in the voice?  Hey, man, I heard my voice in the background.  Yeah, you gotta lower your, uh, radio thingy.  I think he's a first-timer, actually.  Ramone, first-timer, what do you got?  Um, I just talked to you, you just had me on hold, I guess, but, um, I just wanted to  say, man, I love y'all's show.  This is, like, my first time listening to it, and I love it.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, sir.  Look at that. 
[02:56:00]  New listener.  Thanks, Ramone.  Y'all talking about some crazy shit, man, but I love it, man.  Like, I was in here geeking, man, whoever he is that doesn't like voice, man, I'm going  to start listening to y'all's show all the time, man, because y'all is hilarious.  All right.  It's like the first 48.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Cool, man.  And keep the racism down.  Thanks.  Yeah, right?  We got one on the line.  Take care.  Keep the racism down for a little bit.  I try.  I try.  Black guys like it because they hear what whitey is really like on this show.  It's honest.  Exactly.  Thank you, Ramone.  Goddamn down there.  I'm surprised he didn't call.  Me! 
[02:56:30]  The old Ramone bit I haven't done in a long time.  Ramone.  Ramone.  I got a Steve from Yellowstone somebody.  There was a, I believe it was Marilyn, there was a new videotape out with some officers having  some fun with a gentleman.  Is that the one that he's covering up with a box and there's 50 of them running by?  No, it's a young gentleman kind of against a wall and a horse comes out, a cop on a horse 
[02:57:00]  and bumps the guy smack into the wall with the horse's chest.  And then I guess they decided that that gentleman was abusing the horse by wailing his head into  the horse's chest and then hitting the wall.  So three cops pounced on him and beat the shit out of him and arrested him.  Last month on the streets of College Park, Maryland, after the home team Terps beat Duke  in a basketball game.  22-year-old John McKenna, look at him, skipping there on the side toward a group of officers 
[02:57:30]  on horseback.  Seconds later, a swarm of cops unload on the student and now that victim is promising a  lawsuit.  But is there more to this story than meets the eye?  Let's ask our panel.  All right, can we pause that for a second?  Beat the piss out of him.  But what did the guy do?  He was taunting the horse because you can't really see it in the video.  They originally said that he was doing something, assaulting the horse or something.  And you can't see him doing that.  I think the cops just wanted to jump on a little skipping guy. 
[02:58:00]  But he might have been saying some verbal shit, right?  Maybe, but, you know, if you're saying stuff, it doesn't mean you could get the shit  bounced out of you.  They just looked like they wanted to tune someone up, have a little fun.  And again, oh, those darn cameras.  They're everywhere.  Yeah, they're everywhere.  It's insane to think that a cop in this day and age had put his job on the line and quite  possibly his freedom on the line because there's cameras everywhere.  But it's not like the old days where you could just beat the fuck out of them and walk away. 
[02:58:30]  But it's like, what was that guy doing?  Were they just, what was their explanation of what he could have been doing?  Well, without the camera there, they said he had made some kind of threatening gestures  and stuff to the horse, like Mungo.  He's going to punch the horse and knock him out.  Can we see what they say, Dan?  That's the whole thing?  Not quite.  Can we see that again, the skipping thing?  Yeah, Mr. Skippy guy.  Just skipping down the...  I actually think I saw something.  Did you?  Yeah.  Oh, you didn't see it. 
[02:59:00]  I did.  Let's take a little peek at this.  Is it on Breitbart?  Breitbart Park.  We haven't been on Breitbart in a while.  Breitbart.  We've got to do something for Breitbart soon.  A little Breitbart action.  There we go.  All right.  Kelly Court is back in session on the docket today.  One college senior versus a full squad of riot cops.  Check out the scene last month on the streets of College Park, Maryland,  after the home team Terps beat Duke in a basketball game.  22-year-old John McKenna, look at him, skipping there on the side, 
[02:59:30]  toward a group of officers on horseback.  Seconds later, a swarm of cops unload on the student,  and now that victim is promising a lawsuit.  But is there more to this story than meets the eye?  Did he punch the horse?  Jimmy, what did you say?  Did he punch the horse in the mouth?  No.  Go back a little.  I might have seen him punch the horse in the mouth when the horse got real close to him.  Unless he was trying to feed him a sugar cube.  He was either punching the horse or feeding him a little sugar cube.  To be honest with you, I don't know if he was skipping and being a dick. 
[03:00:00]  Obviously just being whatever.  But was he being a dick to the cops or because the team just won?  Or was he just being obnoxious?  He pretty much aggressively started moving toward the horses, though.  But then he stopped.  Here's what tells me.  Maybe he did some kind of like little shadow box real quickly.  He stopped.  Watch when he stops, though.  When he sees the horse coming and he steps towards the wall like, oh, fuck.  Watch.  He might have...  White.  All right, he stops because he sees the horse.  He moves. 
[03:00:30]  No, he didn't punch the horse.  No way.  No.  No.  God, I would love to know what the cops saw.  Or heard.  He backed the fuck up.  The cops...  What are they doing?  Like, they went after...  It might have been at the same time.  Like, they might have been approaching him.  Mounted officer.  Moments later, a group of officers...  All right, they're running at him.  And then strike him repeatedly after he...  I think basically...  Could have been in an area he wasn't supposed to be in. 
[03:01:00]  But I think basically the horse was moving toward him.  And I'm sure the cops were like, back up, back up.  Yeah, they have that area cordoned off.  Yeah, they don't want it.  They don't want anyone in that area.  They are tuning him the fuck up.  He's knocked out.  He's unconscious.  And they're still just pounding him.  My God, man.  Let's say hi to Dave in Maryland.  Dave.  Better Dave.  He lives down there.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, I just want to tell you.  That particular jurisdiction in Maryland, they have at least 10 lawsuits every year against  their officers for kicking the shit out of people. 
[03:01:30]  I was at a bar one night in College Park.  And they...  Well, anyways, it got out of hand.  They come in there with their nightsticks and just started beating the shit out of everybody.  Me and my brother took off out the back door.  But, I mean, this went on for like five minutes.  They were just beating the shit out of everybody with nightsticks.  Yeah.  Well, you shouldn't have been there.  Yeah, I was just drinking minding my own business.  Well, because you shouldn't have been minding your own business. 
[03:02:00]  Now, if that video is as it appears, like if there's nothing that happened that we didn't  see or, you know, if the guy didn't say I'm reaching for a pistol, how can you justify  keeping those guys hired?  They gotta be fucking...  All they do is make every time a cop makes a legitimate arrest or fucking people go to  a video like that and go, see, they're just fucking with me.  It's like every cop now has to get shit because of that.  He looks guilty of something.  Well, that's just fucking horrible, though.  All right, let's go to Mike in Indiana. 
[03:02:30]  Mike!  Mike!  Hey, guys.  Hey.  This situation you're talking about.  Yeah.  Before these guys realized that they were on video, one cop filed a false report that he's  already out of there.  He's already out.  The other ones are probably going to get suspended, and now they're talking about prosecution.  Hmm.  They fucking assaulted the guy.  The one that filed a report said that the horse did the end guy had any injuries.  It's probably getting kicked by the horse.  Right, right. 
[03:03:00]  And then it turned out on tape that he was on the ground and getting pummeled with night  sticks.  Yeah, and that one's already been suspended for a file of false report.  Damn.  Man, that's fucked up.  Later, guys.  You just can't do that in this day and age, no matter how justified it is.  But it wasn't even there.  At times.  No, I mean at times.  Yeah.  Of course, at times, you know, somebody needs a good fucking mouth wrapping.  It escalated really fast.  The guy might have been being a prick.  The guy didn't realize he was walking really close to the horses because he stopped like, 
[03:03:30]  whoa, what's this?  And then, you know, they obviously were telling him, you know, back off, back off.  And then the thing just escalated.  Apparently, if the cops were very quickly and the horses were there, that area was supposed  to be clear of people.  Obviously, they were keeping people back.  But he was doing his weird skip thing, his little dance up into that area.  And he didn't realize all of a sudden he went into this area.  It looked like he was like confused.  He was like, oh, fuck.  He might have been a dick.  I'm not saying that this is justified beating.  I'm not defending the cops.  I'm just going with what it looks like on the video. 
[03:04:00]  That's all.  Because you don't know what the cops are saying, unfortunately.  They could have just turned him around.  You don't know if the guy was yelling and screaming and being an asshole to the horses and cops.  Kenny, what do you think?  How do you scream and be an asshole to a horse?  Archer for faggot.  Yeah, you fucking...  I don't know if you're fucking...  Why the long face?  Hey, Voss!  Dude, if you're drunk...  That kind of business.  Yeah.  If you're drunk, you'll do just stupid things.  Things.  We don't know that.  What do you think?  What do you got, Kenny, on this?  It's not fair to comment.  Obviously, we haven't seen the whole video.  Exactly.  It's out of context.  But from what you see? 
[03:04:30]  That piece of shit was taunting the cops and the horses.  Yeah.  He probably got...  Oh, I don't know.  Kenny.  It's hard to say because it did look like he was being a dick, but it was the way he stopped  when the horse approached him.  It was like he wasn't being physically like he was going to do it.  He was just being a dick.  But you know what?  I think at that point, the other cops were already rushing him.  And once that trigger is pulled...  Once they're running at you...  I would explain...  That would explain the initial impact.  I would almost accept that.  They just knocked him down and cuffed him because he was being a dick. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, but they didn't know the camera was on.  It was the 40 blows after.  They didn't know the cameras were on.  That's why.  They just make cops' jobs fucking harder, though.  Because you know people are fucking gunning for cops.  You know it's this fucking politically correct society.  And it's like that just makes every cop's job harder.  It's just...  I don't know.  It does, but...  I can't explain that.  Yeah.  That's a tough one.  That's a tough one.  There are cops that deserve to be fucking fired.  They're not always right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know if you've... 
[03:05:30]  I don't know if you have the whole story.  I want to know what that...  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, I want to know what that guy was saying.  I mean, they obviously shouldn't have filed a false report.  They should have just said this guy was fucking doing this.  And we reacted like that.  And we had to control the situation because there was a lot of people down there.  So we couldn't let anyone, you know...  Yeah, shenanigans.  What happened, Jimmy?  I gotta go.  Where are you going?  Oh!  You just get up in the middle of...  Jimmy!  What's going...  What happened?  He's all right.  He's got things to do.  I gotta shoot.  He's a busy boy. 
[03:06:00]  Shoot!  Oh, shoot!  But he got up in the middle of our discussion on this.  All right.  He looked at the clock.  Teddy D ain't gonna wait for me.  No!  A Teddy D.  He's got stuff to do.  Hey, Jimmy.  All right.  Pack your bags.  Yeah.  Look at you.  I always bring a little bag with me to my trailer.  I have my pillow in it.  This is...  Do you have your pillow?  Yes.  Aw.  That's what I bring, a pillow.  A lot of down time, Jimmy?  You do a little napping in between the fucking scenes? 
[03:06:30]  Today's a pretty busy outdoor scene.  Ooh.  It's, uh...  It'll be me, the guy...  Dominic will be in it.  And I think Ted Danson's in it.  Ooh.  And Zach is in it.  And Jason Schwartzman's in it.  And fucking...  The guy who plays Jason's father, you guys would know him if you saw him.  He's been in fucking everything.  Yeah?  Yeah, I can't remember his name, but he's been in...  He's like one of those J.T. Walsh guys.  Look at you.  Yeah, so you know. 
[03:07:00]  First, you know, I fight a little bit, and then I go act.  That's what I do.  That's what you do.  Like, like, like, like.  Like, Ted.  Like, like, like, like.  What a fucking asshole I am.  Just no value as a man.  But it's sad.  We're sitting right here, and we didn't even notice.  I heard it twice and didn't notice.  I know.  I'm like, I'm like, I just said, I'm like, I'm sitting here going, wow, Jimmy's doing  a great interview.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you know.  All right, Jimmy.  Break a leg.  Not really.  I'll be here tomorrow and Friday, though, because... 
[03:07:30]  Yay!  You know.  Yay!  Well, let me, you know what?  Let me take this opportunity to tell you what's happening on tomorrow's show as Jimmy  leaves.  Oh, my goodness.  What's happening?  Is it a big...  We got Jim Norton's friend and our friend at this point, Bob Levy, coming by.  Oh, good.  Oh.  Really big shoot.  We got Ashley Dupree coming by.  Uh-huh.  Does anyone know who Ashley Dupree is?  Yes.  Yep.  Took down the governor, Elliot Spitzer.  Right.  She's coming by finally to say hi.  Ooh.  Maybe I could, uh... 
[03:08:00]  Oh, well.  You should.  That might, you know.  Like, pay?  All right.  You know what, though?  You might as well.  Yeah?  You might as well have that on your bucket list, Anthony.  Amy.  Bye, Jimmy.  Actually, Ted Danson, I don't say a word.  Actually, um...  He...  Later.  You see us both hoping, like, what, what?  He actually...  And then he walks out.  Prick.  Fucking Jimmy Rolls.  We sat up quickly, like, really?  All needy.  Does he know us?  Ashley Dupree could be part of your bucket list. 
[03:08:30]  Um...  The one that took down...  Dude.  That's solid.  All right.  Let me take a...  That's a solid one for your fucking bucket list.  I'm gonna pop her up over here and take a look, see?  She's right.  She's right.  Let me see.  Ash.  I don't know what she's promoting.  Lee.  I don't think she could promote that.  She's a whore.  Two.  Three.  What is she...  What is she promoting on the show tomorrow?  Playboy.  Images.  She's doing Playboy.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, she did a Playboy spread.  What is she showing in Playboy, Danny, you know?  My intel tells me it's boobies.  Boobies?  Just boobies. 
[03:09:00]  But I'm seeing her covered, boobies.  Because it depends.  Some of these girls get into Playboy and show nothing.  They just kind of almost show something.  You know what?  She decided she agreed to boobies.  There's something going on here.  Now I'm hearing that it's boobies and punani.  And what?  Punani.  Punani.  Punani.  There's a little manliness there.  Let me see.  I'm looking...  All right, let me pop this up.  You know, I'm glad you're saying this because I'm not a fan.  Are you a fan?  That picture's hot as shit.  The first one that came out where she's... 
[03:09:30]  Oh, we got the Playboy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  You hoarding this shit?  Let me see.  What the fuck are you doing?  All right, I'm a fan.  Okay, we're both fans now.  This is as hot as they can make her.  Wait, is these black and whites over here too?  Start from the beginning of the pictorial.  All right, let's go.  It's already...  All right, we're fans.  The page is...  Oh, my God.  All right, we're big fans.  Look at that ass.  Ashley Dupree's in the latest issue of Playboy.  That's May 2010.  The ass is very, very nice. 
[03:10:00]  Let me take a look.  Mm-hmm.  That's where the poo comes out.  Now we'll look at...  The poo comes out is nice.  We'll look at her vagina.  And she's got the solid tat about the vagina.  Well, in between the belly button and the hole.  Looking at her...  The whole body here.  That is a nice vagina that looks like it would be a nice fit on a wee-wee.  Sam, I know you don't like girls, but if you did, would this be a good one?  What would you think?  I do like girls, and she is a good one.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I got confused.  Thank you very much.  What do you think? 
[03:10:30]  What do you think of Ashley Dupree?  I guess I would.  She cleans up nice, Ant.  Yeah, I'm looking at where her poo-poo comes out.  She's not really showing where the poo comes out.  Where her cocky comes out of her poo-wee hole.  She's not showing where the poo comes out, unfortunately.  Why isn't she showing where the poo comes out?  We're retarded.  I don't know.  I want to see where the doody comes out.  I want to see the hole where the doodoo comes out.  I haven't seen this magazine yet, so...  Okay.  Can I see where she makes from?  Look where... 
[03:11:00]  See where she makes.  And we're bombed that they're not showing a little dirt.  Doody.  We like to see where the poo comes out, and we like to see just a little dirt.  A little dirt.  I want it to be able to go, press the button, pull the chain, out comes the chocolate choo-choo  train.  And is it your new favorite bit to talk about where the poo comes out?  Yes.  Because it's early as mine.  Where the doody comes out.  Maybe we can play milk, milk, lemonade, around the corner, fudges made.  That's the one I was just trying to think of.  God damn.  Milk, milk, lemonade.  That survived past our generation? 
[03:11:30]  Around the corner, fudges made.  Stick your finger in the hole, out comes a titsy roll.  Did you ever imagine that that would survive our generation?  And the young go-getters like, what are they calling you, baby face?  What was your, I don't have, what are you?  Hey, Kenny!  I think he's taking Jimmy out.  Oh, he is?  Milk, lemonade.  And how great is it that it survived our generation?  I know.  And the kids are saying the exact same fucking thing we did when we were your age.  It's passed on like a cave painting. 
[03:12:00]  It's just, it's too clever.  It can't.  It really is.  It's one for the ages.  Yeah.  Kenny.  Hey, I forgot what Sam Roberts' new nickname is now that he's the big overnight jock on  Hits 1.  You haven't even told anyone yet.  I know.  But he goes by what name on Hits 1?  Sam, no, say it.  Sam Roberts.  No, no.  No, who are you?  Come on, tell the whole backstory.  Come on.  There's no backstory.  Yeah.  No biack story.  No biack.  No biack story. 
[03:12:30]  We were discussing what my on-air name would be.  This is a conversation that I told Kenny about, which I shouldn't have because he's just decided  to make things up because of it.  No, man.  Someone on the way in today was talking about your new name.  It's not a rumor.  It was probably Club Soda Kenny.  Well, yeah.  He was the person.  You're right.  But...  Teddy, what's the name?  Come on.  Say it.  There's no name at first.  Don't get embarrassed.  Well, at first I told Kid Kelly that my middle name was Wood, as I told you guys recently.  Yes, it is Wood. 
[03:13:00]  And for a moment, he said, what about Woody Roberts?  And I informed him that...  Woody Roberts wouldn't...  That was probably not a great idea.  Woody Roberts wouldn't fly.  Yes.  Well, that's your name now.  No, no, there's a better one.  And so he said, okay, well, I like Sam Roberts.  And I said, I like that name too.  Because it's your name.  And so I'm Sam Roberts.  So you're lucky.  I had to be...  T-Bone!  I had to be Greg Opie Hughes for a while.  T-Bone.  That don't make sense.  I dropped the prime time when I'm on Hits 1. 
[03:13:30]  I see that.  Do you?  You're not prime time?  Just Sam Roberts.  No, no, there's a better name.  Sam Roberts isn't a good one.  Kenny.  Really?  No.  They wouldn't let him have prime time because it's overnights.  And it's not prime time.  Right.  Kid Kelly said, I'm on prime time on the Obi and Anthony show because the morning is the  prime time.  You should be called No One's Listening Roberts then.  Well, I don't know if that's fair.  Kenny listens.  That's nice.  Kenny listens, Roberts?  Yeah.  What?  You know how many Nickelback songs I have to sit through to hear a little baby boy talk 
[03:14:00]  for 15 seconds?  Baby boy.  Baby boy Sam Roberts.  Is that what they're calling you?  No.  This is something Kenny made up.  Kenny.  He talks so fast, his voice goes up like three octaves.  Where's an air check?  Yeah, why don't we have an air check yet?  My God, we should have an air check of your fucking drivel.  I can give you an air check.  Can we please have an air check?  No.  You know what you can learn from listening to his show?  What?  If you eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, it'll take five years off your life, but it's worth it. 
[03:14:30]  That was a break.  There's a break.  No, that was a break.  It certainly is.  What song were you talking about?  I don't remember for that one.  Breaking Entertainment.  KFC, I'm sure it was.  Oh, I don't know what that's supposed to.  If you give me five minutes, I'll give you air checks.  Yeah, let's get some air checks.  Let's take a break, and we're going to listen to baby face Sam Roberts do his first show  for Hits 1.  I guess he's doing overnights now.  Wow, is that what he's doing?  So what time does he?  3 to 6.  3 to 6 a.m.?  Yeah.  This company.  Let me tell you about this fine company. 
[03:15:00]  There's going to be two people working here doing everything.  So Sam does our show, right?  Yeah.  And then he's doing overnights for Hits 1, but it's, should we say it's voice tracked?  No, he's there live.  He's there live.  But Sam has to wait around here until 3 or 4 until they come up with the playlist for  the overnights, and then Sam can do his show for Hits 1.  Wow.  They don't make anything easy around here.  Why can't they have his songs ready for when we're done with him? 
[03:15:30]  Help a guy out.  Yeah, no kidding.  Help a half an hour.  Right.  He's got to wait around here for about four or five hours.  And then they finally go, all right, here's the songs.  And the songs are going to be the same ones they did the night before because it's, they  play 20 songs over and over again.  If you want to be a big radio star, you know, you got to get in there and, you know, you  got to get in there and, you know, battle it out.  Why don't we take a break?  Take the shit.  Why don't we take a break, Ant? 
[03:16:00]  But let's remember, tomorrow is a big day.  Oh, so you got Bob Levy, who's hilarious.  He's done some great radio for us the last few months.  You got Ashley Dupree, who's in the latest Playboy magazine.  I think we're going to get along with this, Ashley Dupree, and also, I'm excited about  this.  I don't know Anthony so much, but the Stanley Cup is coming by to say hi.  The actual Stanley Cup is coming by to say hi.  Oh, we had that happen once before over at Gay Rock.  We sure did.  Yes.  Why are you calling it Gay Rock now?  Because that's what it is now. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, you're right.  So we're going to check out the Stanley Cup tomorrow.  Maybe we can make a duty in it.  Do you think we could put our hiney on top of the Stanley Cup and make poo-poo in it?  I want to make it to the Stanley Cup.  How bad would you want to make it?  I would fucking...  I would love to make in the Stanley Cup.  Oh, that would be great.  Just a big load of poo-poo coming out of your coolie hole.  But we would show the Stanley Cup some respect. 
[03:17:00]  It would be a solid long...  We clean it out afterwards.  A nice solid one.  I can't promise that.  I can't either.  I had fucking linguine and clam sauce last night.  Oh, God.  Red or white?  Red, Kenny.  Red.  Which way?  Red.  Red.  And I bought a telescope.  Maybe I should talk about that next.  Oh, shit.  You're not stargazing, are you?  Oh, you got a telescope?  No, but I want to get one.  All right.  We'll talk about my telescope purchase next.  You know what you're doing, by the way? 
[03:17:30]  I know you.  Shut up.  You're looking at people in Jersey.  What?  It all depends on how powerful his scope is, but let me tell you something.  That fucking universe is a fascinating fucking thing.  Yeah.  We'll talk about my telescope next.  Sure it is.  All right?  Because Danny's excited.  He wants one.  And I know exactly where to go and who to see.  Really?  You're a telescope aficionado.  You got to see Myron.  Myron?  I'll explain next.  Cone?  The telescope guy?  The telescope guy, yes.  I'm going to have to start brown nose.  Could be the biggest fucking creep I've ever met. 
[03:18:00]  Well, I'll get into it next.  Telescope guys, of course they're creeps.  Biggest creep I've ever met, but I knew I was getting the telescope.  Well, that's what you want.  We'll explain that and other things.  Hi, this is Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony program.  Thursday through Saturday, April 29th to May 1st, I'll be returning to Pittsburgh at  The Improv.  You can go to theimprov.com.  I think you know that.  And also, two shows in Seattle, both on a Friday, May 28th. 
[03:18:30]  It's at the Showbox at the market.  You can just go to Ticketmastery and get tickets for there in Seattle, which is kind of north  of here.  3,000 miles west if you're driving.  Boo.  Yeah, co-fucking-kane.  Can you get the mail, honey?  Fuck you, you smelly cunt sack.  Now you're going to get a fucking boot to your clit for talking.  I think your wow stickers came to the end.  Motherfucking wow stickers?  Kick ass.  Get the fuck out of my way, you fish pussy cum dumpster. 
[03:19:00]  I wish I never fucked our baby to death so I could fuck it again in front of you.  Maybe I'll dig them up.  Little fetter.  Let's see.  Bills.  Kitty porn.  Yeah.  Wow stickers.  I'm going to see me some motherfucking tits.  Excuse me, could you please not cuss?  My kids, they're right here.  Now look what I do to your kids.  Hey kids, maybe you'll like some of my fucking shit on your faces.  Man, good thing I sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to wow stickers, care of Sirius XM Radio, 1221 6th Avenue, 36th Floor, New York, New York, 10020. 
[03:19:30]  Hey bitch, how's them teeth?  Now I'm going to put my wow sticker on my bitchin' Camaro and rape me some junior high school girls.  If you're like our friend Bill and you're a wow sticker, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to wow stickers, care of Sirius XM Radio, 1221 6th Avenue, 36th Floor, New York, New York, 10020. 
[03:20:00]  Hello.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show on the virus, Sirius XM.  COC, clean my wounds.  So, it's a quickie, whatever.  I went to B&H.  B&H, that place rules. 
[03:20:30]  There's a place in Manhattan, it's called B&H.  What is it called?  What's the whole name?  B&H.  B&H Photo.  Electronics or something?  Electronics.  Because they sell everything.  B&H Photo and Video.  Photo and Video.  And they're not advertisers, but you know what?  When you come across a company that knows what the fuck they're doing, they really should just get an acknowledgement.  My agent, our agent, gave me a nice fucking wedding gift, right?  But I didn't like it. 
[03:21:00]  I didn't like it, so I brought it back to B&H and I got like a store credit.  B&H?  And the store credit is just sitting in my desk.  Actually, it wasn't even in a desk.  It was in a box.  I'm rearranging my whole place because we got a new arrival coming within weeks at this point, right?  So, I discovered that I got the store credit.  I'm like, holy shit, it's like finding money.  And it was for a lot of money, something like $800.  That fucking Bob Eatman did the right thing.  So, I go down there and I got some wireless headphones for the girl. 
[03:21:30]  Because she likes to watch a little TV and stuff while I'm trying to sleep.  Certainly.  So, now she got her wireless headphones.  Nice little gift.  And that was to disguise the real reason why I went there.  Right.  I got her a gift so she wouldn't be so creeped out at the gift I got myself.  That you just bought something for yourself.  Which was a almost telescope, I call it.  Almost telescope.  Yeah, because a telescope is just a little...  The telescope, if you get a telescope, Anthony, you're a little too close to the heavenly bodies. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  So, there's something called like...  I don't know what the real name is, but it's like an almost telescope.  Let's just put it this way.  Almost telescope.  It's better than binoculars, but not as good as a telescope.  Is it like a spotter scope?  It's like a spotter scope.  I believe that would be the name, Anthony.  So, if you set up in the...  You know, sometimes hunters use them for spotting.  Sure.  Sure.  Things like that.  They're good for bird watching.  Okay.  If you've got a rare bird in a tree about a half mile away. 
[03:22:30]  Right.  People are calling it a field scope.  A field scope.  A creeposcope.  A creeposcope.  There's another word that's coming in.  That's very funny who said that.  Dude, I go to this B&H, right?  It's run by...  I think they're Hasidic Jews, right?  Yes.  This fucking place rules.  If you ever get your ass to Manhattan...  Yeah.  ...because the locals know already, and you're looking for stuff, you go in there.  They spend so much time with you, it's almost annoying. 
[03:23:00]  They will not just go, here you go.  Yeah.  They will look up reviews in front of you.  They'll talk you through the whole thing.  It's amazing.  And then the whole delivery system is all automated, so you'll see conveyor belts moving  on the ceiling, and your order comes down.  I don't know where they learned such efficiency like that.  Such wonderful efficiency.  Well...  Are you trying to say...  What?  I'm just saying...  What?  I'm just saying they've learned how to take stuff and really run it through and remedy 
[03:23:30]  it quicker.  They've learned...  I believe when you finally get your item, that the final solution to the problem of getting  your item...  Are you nuts?  ...has been taken care of, is all I'm trying to say.  You know how many people came up to me in that damn place and said they're big fans?  They really do.  You're not allowed to listen to electronics.  How are you big fans of ours?  Dude, I... 
[03:24:00]  Well, maybe they're allowed as long as the sun is still up.  I don't understand the rules, but they've got some crazy rules.  Let me inform you of something, if they're listening and don't like my sense of humor.  I have spent upwards of probably $60,000 to $70,000 in that store.  Wow.  Probably...  Knowing that, they would probably...  Close to $100,000.  They would probably sacrifice their own relatives knowing that you're a good customer.  I bought all of my Canon HD X-L1 cameras in there.  The reason they have the conveyor belts and all that shit above your head is to cut down 
[03:24:30]  on theft.  So you buy your thing there, but you can't just take it up to the counter.  Now it goes down into the fucking warehouse, wherever that is, and then it's delivered  to you.  It efficiently comes out.  So I knew I wanted to get a...  Someone's calling it a pedoscope.  A pedoscope?  Oh, I didn't get that one.  Fuck, look at that one.  They're calling it a raposcope, too.  Fuck, dude.  A raposcope.  I live very high up in a building here in Manhattan.  Yes.  Which means it cuts down on the light of the city, so now you got... 
[03:25:00]  You could enjoy some orbs.  Some orbs.  Now you have the darkness also of the river.  That's right.  So it's not like...  I live right on the river.  Do you say good morning and good night to the river?  Not yet.  I'm not that old yet.  No.  I just...  Make wonderful friends.  Right.  So I knew I wanted one of these things.  Yeah.  Dude, I made up...  This is what I told the guy.  Oh, no.  Me and the kids, I said.  All right.  So right away, lie. 
[03:25:30]  Well, because you walk into the telescope fucking section, and there's no one in there.  Yeah.  Except for this guy, I think his name was Myron.  You got a boner.  Myron behind the counter.  You feel like a creep.  Yeah.  Because you know what they're thinking.  Of course.  So I'm like, yeah, me and the kids, I live in this building, and we want to look across  the river, I said.  Across the river?  I'm just lying blatantly, because I feel like such a creep.  So you want to look at Jersey?  I want to look at Jersey with the kids, I said.  I don't have any kids. 
[03:26:00]  I will have one soon.  But I was making believe I had kids at that age that were into exploring.  Yeah.  That's it.  The guy behind the counter had, he had to be pushing 60, okay?  Jet black hair that was under a hat.  So I think it was a hat hairpiece with creepy glasses.  And I go, yeah, I'm looking for, I'm not looking for binoculars or telescopes, something 
[03:26:30]  in between.  Could you suggest something?  He fucking had a product in front of my eyes going, this is the one I use.  He was speaking my language, Anthony.  He goes, this is the one I use.  And then told me all the bells and whistles and what I could do with this.  Uh-huh.  In code.  He talked in code.  But knowing that he was a creep, I knew that I was buying a fine product at this B&H.  All right.  So what parts of Jersey were you looking at?  Well. 
[03:27:00]  Right across the GWB?  Well, I had to work on the focus.  So I was looking at some, you know, some other things.  All right.  Yeah, work on the focus.  I had to fine-tune the lenses and stuff.  All right.  I was looking at some cross streets and, you know, I had to focus on smaller objects to  kind of fine-tune the thing.  Yeah.  Learn how to aim it properly at your target.  Slow down.  I'll tell you which one I got.  Oh, it's there?  I think so.  Oh, my God.  Let's see. 
[03:27:30]  You ghoul.  Did you get a good one?  I got a pretty good one according to Myron.  He said it's the only one to get.  I don't remember.  Yeah, something like the.  That's pretty.  Yeah, something like that one.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  You creep.  And he got all excited when he goes, and we're going to throw in a free tripod.  Say, don't worry.  I'll make my own.  He goes, if you buy this one, I'll throw in a free tripod. 
[03:28:00]  This guy was getting off fucking selling me a creeposcope, as everyone's calling it.  What's the power on it?  Like, how many times magnification is it?  Dude, let's just put it this way.  I live on the west side of Manhattan.  I could see clear to the east side of Manhattan.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  You could count the bumps on the nipples.  Is that what you're saying?  That's beautiful.  And it's not like people leave their window shades open in these buildings in Manhattan. 
[03:28:30]  It's a very private, modest town.  There's not one fucking apartment that has a shade in Manhattan.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Do you know how often I stay in hotels that I have no idea if the windows are frosted, mirrored, or blacked out,  or just open windows, and I have the shades open, and I'm just walking with half a rod?  Like, I wake up in the middle of the night with a piss heart on, and the light's on, and I'm just walking around? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  You don't care.  You're up high.  For some reason, you wouldn't do that on the first floor.  No.  But for some reason, you get over a certain altitude, and it's okay to walk around with no clothes on and a window right there in front of you, but that you wouldn't do on the street level.  Yeah, no.  When I was looking through this thing, I was just kind of trying it out.  I counted.  Yeah.  A hundred.  Close to a hundred.  I stopped counting.  Close to a hundred creeposcopes in other apartments.  Creeposcopes.  And they could see your creeposcope now. 
[03:29:30]  Everyone has them.  Well, all right.  It's like an arms race, though.  You got one.  I got one.  Now what?  You should get one, like, fucking at one of the observatories, like one that's a giant dome that's in your fucking window.  It's electronic, has motors on it, big mirrors.  Winston has one of those.  Winston?  Yeah, he's my creepy neighbor that we crashed his karaoke New Year's Eve party a year and a half ago, and he has one of those big, huge fucks. 
[03:30:00]  It has to be a telescope.  It's this big, the lens.  How big is that?  That's fucking big.  That's like a plate.  Like a 10-inch mirror.  Almost like a plate.  12-inch mirror, something like that.  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck he's looking at.  That's pretty nice, yeah.  Maybe he is looking at the stars.  You know, that would be kind of cool.  Somebody thought it was like, oh, it was like a sniper game.  That would be kind of cool if there was a way to have a sniper game where you have a telescope with crosshairs and some kind of lazing unit on it, 
[03:30:30]  and you look for other people that have the same thing.  Yeah.  And you have to pick them off without getting picked off.  Funny you should say that because my old, well, you know Buzzy.  Buzzy's in town.  Sure.  My really good friend.  We go way back, and he's in town on business.  He works for Cox Media.  What media?  Cox.  Media.  He's coming by Friday.  He'll throw me under the bus with a story or two.  But he was over, and he said exactly that.  He's like, this is like a fucking sniper. 
[03:31:00]  Like, we're sniping.  You just kind of look and go, this person has no idea.  No fucking idea.  Not a clue.  I was looking at a cross street that, I'm telling you, was, I can't even tell you how fucking far it was.  I'm like, you're not fucking kidding.  And we're reading license plates.  And just seeing people walking around.  And we're reading license plates off cabs and shit.  No clue.  Yeah, you should see what it looks like through an ACOG.  But Danny wants a real telescope?  Oh, yeah.  I've always wanted one for a long time.  I remember being a kid, I asked my grandmother for a telescope for my birthday, and I got basically what amounted to, like, a periscope with really cheap, you know, like, binocular lenses. 
[03:31:30]  You know, I couldn't see shit.  I could barely see across the street.  Like, you got to stretch it out like a pirate's periscope?  That's right.  That's exactly right.  It sucked.  Captain Jack Sparrow's.  It fucking sucked.  A looking glass, it's called.  So, yeah, I want to get a good one.  Because, you know, I used to live in Queens, and it's all, you know, with all the light from the city, you can't see shit.  You got the Road Warriors telescope.  But now I'm further out on the island, and I was looking outside.  I'm like, shit, it's pretty goddamn clear and dark.  I want to get a goddamn telescope.  I live so high up, I see the lights of the city below me. 
[03:32:00]  Below you?  What?  Below me.  Oh.  Below me.  I thought you said something else.  And my brother, my brother Brett, I told the Brett story, right?  He gave me his binoculars when he got married.  He was bummed because he moved to a place he can't use them anymore.  These fucking high-powered binoculars were amazing.  I told you a story where he would set his alarm clock to watch the girl shower next door.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Did I tell you that story?  His old apartment.  I think when we were talking about the girl that was across from us at K-Rock that we used to watch. 
[03:32:30]  Okay.  His old place in Huntington.  You know, the owner of FH Riley's.  Of course.  It was a terrific restaurant, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  Brett lives next door to this house where, bathroom window, old school house, so it didn't have the fucking, what was it called?  The frosting of the windows or whatever.  And this girl would just, pretty hot, would get fucking naked every morning, get ready for work.  And Brett would set his alarm clock, even though he didn't have to get up, it was before the restaurant. 
[03:33:00]  And he would set up snacks on the window ledge and just eat snacks and watch this girl go through her morning routine every fucking morning.  And he said it got to a point where she definitely knew he was looking.  Yeah.  And she had no problem with it.  You could pop up videos of nudity and perversion and whatever, but there is something just so hot about the whole voyeuristic thing of watching a girl taking her clothes off with a telescope through a fucking window. 
[03:33:30]  I don't know why, but it is.  It turns a three into a fucking eight.  It's ridiculous.  Because they're nude and live and you're watching them.  But the best part of the story was he would set up fucking snacks.  Like he's at the movies.  Yeah.  Some popcorn Twizzlers.  Yeah.  I'm not getting a camera for my telescope.  A large farva.  A large farva.  I want a large farva.  A liter of cola. 
[03:34:00]  And you know what?  At this point, fucking the HD flip people should be paying me.  I was going to get another HD flip at B&H, but the guy, and this is how cool they are over there, and I'm telling you, they're not sponsors or anything.  They're just a solid business.  He goes, don't buy it.  There's a new one coming out today, and we don't have it yet.  We're going to have it later this week.  That's the slide, right?  The slide HD looks fucking phenomenal.  I'm going to pick this up, yo.  I think I'm going somewhere else today to get it because I can't go all the way down to B&H, unfortunately. 
[03:34:30]  Four hours of recording on the new slide HD.  You know what I'm going to do the second I get this new slide?  I'm going to videotape my other four flip cams.  That's a good idea.  Yes.  I'm going to set them up and videotape them all that I have just laying around.  But this one looks really, really, really cool.  It looks really good.  Yeah, it's got a bigger video screen on it.  It's touchscreen.  I mean, it looks like a girl's phone.  It flips up.  It flips up like a girl's phone.  So you can text.  Like one of those phones.  Yeah, but this thing looks fucking great. 
[03:35:00]  It really does.  I've got to get this today.  So I think that was released today or yesterday.  It's called the slide HD.  Where's it available, though?  How come they don't have it over there?  I don't even mention anybody.  Yeah?  Because, you know, the place I'm probably going to go and get it because I have no choice.  I don't like those people.  No, huh?  No, they don't give you the fucking same treatment.  Are you talking B, B?  I don't like those people.  B, B?  I'm not saying who I'm talking about because they might be sponsors. 
[03:35:30]  Are you talking greatest purchase?  I'm not saying a word.  I'm not saying a word.  Are you talking about the people at better than adequate paid for something and took it home place?  I'm not saying a word.  Yeah, I don't like going there either.  Travis wants to know if it's awesome acquisitions. 
[03:36:00]  I'm not saying a word.  Yes.  Just customer service.  Awesome acquisition.  When you ask someone to help you in a store, you don't want to hear, what?  Yeah.  It's like, relax, man.  I'm fucking buying shit here.  What's your job, really?  I think the problem is that they don't get commission at Awesome Acquisition.  I know.  I'm not even saying who it is.  They don't give a fuck whether you buy something or not.  Awesome Acquisition.  I'm really not saying who it is.  But there's two places I like right now.  The Mac Store, incredible as far as helping you out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And there's B&H, incredible as far as helping you out. 
[03:36:30]  Other places.  J&R's great, too.  You ever go down to J&R?  J&R Music World?  They're independent just like B&H.  Oh, J&R.  We used to do gigs for J&R.  Yeah.  I like J&R.  They're down near Wall Street, right?  Yeah.  They got that whole block down there.  Yeah.  Actually, they're really good, but it's just too far away.  I love to make a trip there to buy some stuff.  You know what I don't like about Awesome Acquisitions?  I didn't say who it was.  Well, I'm just saying, this is what I don't like about Awesome Acquisitions, when you have  to stand there and wait for somebody to come up to help you, and there's people milling 
[03:37:00]  about, or some idiot discussing the simplest fucking thing, and they can't figure it out  themselves, and they're wasting a salesperson's time, and you're waiting there just to say,  could you get one of these?  I did my research at home.  I'm here to make a purchase, not discuss what fucking plug is used for this fucking thing  that this old piece of shit doesn't understand.  I want a purchase.  There you go. 
[03:37:30]  I want to acquire.  Hey, I don't want to lose the sense of feedback.  Michael Spano.  Michael writes us from time to time.  He writes, from New York City, I used to live on the 45th floor of 3 Lincoln Center.  Yeah.  So that's a fine building.  Wow, this guy makes some fucking money.  He writes, I bought a telescope with a camera feed to my 62-inch TV.  I used to be able to see in any window perfectly all the way downtown, like Houston, and watch  on my TV as it scrolled around.  Wow. 
[03:38:00]  That's pretty cool.  That is far.  How far would that be from Lincoln Center, Houston Street?  Wow.  A couple miles?  That's far, yeah.  A couple miles?  He could see for miles and miles.  Miles and miles.  Danny is saying that, I won't say the name of the place, I'll just say,  PC, the guy that wanted to blow me in the tree fort, is the absolute worst.  Mac, Apple dicks.  Apple dicks sucks.  Apple dicks.  Jesus. 
[03:38:30]  They are the worst.  I used to go to Apple dicks for car stereo stuff, and I would stand there and just wait around,  and I'd be standing there for like a half hour, and I'd have to pull somebody from another  department, and they'd go, oh, it's not my department.  Well, find the fucking guy whose department it is.  Yeah, where is he?  What do you want me to do?  Where the fuck is he?  Apple dicks.  Customer service, for the most part, is non-existent.  You know what happens?  It's ridiculous.  And this is the truth.  Nobody beat the Wiz. 
[03:39:00]  Huh?  Nobody beat the Wiz.  I'm the kid, the Wiz.  Nobody beat the Wiz.  Way to go for that.  The Wiz, look at me.  That was fucking great.  Rich.  Elaine going out with the fucking Wiz guy.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, guys.  This isn't Telescope, but it's definitely a classic peep.  Back in the day when I was in middle school, we had the full-on porkies thing. 
[03:39:30]  We went to a day camp that had a sail loft for the sailboats up above the shower vents.  And when the girl counselors would come in from swim lessons, they would always totally  strip down to get all the lake shit off of them.  And we would go upstairs behind the wall in the sail loft and look down through the shower  vent.  And it was the first time I ever saw the most perfect 16-year-old breasts in my life.  It would have been heaven. 
[03:40:00]  Things were laughing at him.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  You have a fine story, but the Seinfeld clip was playing about the Wiz.  Watching the guy in the crown.  Yeah, yeah.  The Wiz guy doing his walk.  He leans back and takes his fist and kind of goes into his chest.  Oh, is that a funny fucking episode?  Right on, brother.  Right on.  God damn.  Thank you, sir.  I'm the weird.  And then there was Crazy Eddie's back in the old days.  Well, he was crazy.  Crazy Eddie. 
[03:40:30]  And then there was another place in New York.  Wasn't he insane?  He, yeah.  Well, his prices were insane.  But was he insane?  He was insane and ended up going to prison.  For something.  For all kinds of improprieties with the SEC and stock.  Disobedience.  Things like that.  Then there was this guy called Uncle Stevie.  And it had a song.  It went, Uncle Stevie loves you.  He goes, I love you.  And you can never understand the price of what he was talking about.  Because he'd blurt out the model number and the price all at the same time. 
[03:41:00]  I used to crack up at this guy because he'd go, pick up a Sony HD 3059623.  Really?  It was the price and everything.  What the fuck is that?  You pick up the Zenith HT 209562893.  And it was the serial number model of the thing and the price.  And he wouldn't say dollars or cents.  He just blurted it all out.  He had no idea what Uncle Stevie was talking about. 
[03:41:30]  So he used to say, instead of I love you, it was I fucked you.  Because Uncle Stevie fucked you every time with his stupid prices.  Nice.  Sony Trinitron 3896B25832.  I've got to find audio of that now.  I don't remember that guy.  Uncle Stevie loves you.  I don't remember him.  I love you.  Let's say hi to Brian in New York.  Brian.  What's up, Creeper?  Hey, buddy.  So there's so much light pollution.  They have to know.  Your wife must know. 
[03:42:00]  You can't see a star even out in Nashville County.  Wait, first of all, of course my wife knows.  She's in on this thing.  She's cool.  I'm not trying to make believe I'm fucking looking at stupid shit.  She's peeping.  But I got paranoid when I went into this B&H.  I'm like, I don't want them to think I'm doing what I'm obviously doing.  So I made believe I had a whole family with kids there.  Fair enough.  Hey, as long as you got it covered, bro.  And Xander's the gayest name ever.  Punching out. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, that's Steve Carlisi named his son Xander, right?  You're looking at naked girls?  No, this guy was a creep.  Yeah?  He goes, oh, let me show you the one I have.  And he's kind of giving me the wink, like, we know what's going on here.  You want the tripod?  And his fucking jet black hair under a hat.  Yeah.  I tried to get a picture of him.  I failed on that one.  Do you have the payas?  Do you have the curls?  I don't know what's going on with that.  The payas.  Because a lot of the guys had the payas, but then a bunch of them didn't. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  So I don't get it.  I don't know if it's a new thing, or are they mixing in some other fucking...  Little yarmulke, some guys.  And some of them wear the wacky hat.  The whole hat with the brim.  They might be mixing in other...  Some have the payas.  Some tuck the payas under sometimes.  They're starting to allow some outsiders in there.  Wow, really?  Oh, so they were mixing in some other Jews.  Yeah, I bought a video camera there last year, and I did not deal with a Jew.  You didn't?  No.  Well, that's stupid on your part.  That is stupid. 
[03:43:30]  No, no, no.  I'm telling you, that's stupid on your part.  Everyone there is so...  They train their people so well.  And Ope's right, they will never try and make you buy something.  No.  I was going back and forth between two cameras.  One was like $200 more, and he's like,  you really don't need to spend that extra $200.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's the best store in New York.  Obviously, you weren't dealing with...  No, obviously.  Black guy was my cashier this time around.  What?  Yeah, so they got some blacks. 
[03:44:00]  That place is like a Benetton ad.  They got blacks.  Oh, my God.  Do they have any Chinese?  I didn't see...  Any Chinese?  I didn't see the chinkies.  Working in there?  Jesus.  I didn't see none.  The Chinese?  That's where I got all of my green screen paint and stuff.  Where else are you going to buy fucking chroma key green paint?  Yeah, they're fucking...  Love that place.  They got everything.  They're fucking cool, and there's a lot of fans in that store.  I couldn't believe how many people are fans of the radio show at B&H, so I want to say  hi to them, and I didn't get a deal.  Hello! 
[03:44:30]  I didn't get a deal or nothing, because I was using stupid Bob Eatman's money.  Yeah.  That dopes money.  Jesus.  That fucking useless...  Oh, my goodness.  ...agent.  Goodness gracious.  Hi, Bob.  Bob listens to us now, so he can be informed.  Does he?  A little bit.  I don't like thinking that he's listening.  My last...  I don't like thinking anyone's listening to tell you the truth.  In his latest email, he referenced, like, a recorded bit.  He referenced, like, me on Ron and Fez.  I'm like, I haven't been on Ron and Fez in over a year.  Oh, I heard that when I was driving... 
[03:45:00]  He was listening...  By the way, that was Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  He was listening to the best of from Ron and Fez.  And I happened to be on that day.  Our show?  Yeah, I think so.  He goes, oh, you're really funny on Ron and Fez.  I'm like, Ron and Fez?  I mean, I would love to be on Ron and Fez.  It's been a while.  I heard that whole thing, too.  Okay.  And at first, I'm like, did I hang out after the show?  And then within a second, I knew it was best.  I don't think Bob knew.  I think Bob really thought that...  No, of course not.  ...I did that that day.  Yeah.  And he wanted to make it known that he's listening, I guess. 
[03:45:30]  Isn't that great when somebody says something?  Yeah, I was listening to the show today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I heard something really funny.  Oh, yeah, what?  And then they say something that didn't involve anyone from the show.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, thanks.  Great.  That's my world.  Thank you.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  That's my world.  Good times.  I heard everyone be funny except you.  Aww.  It made me sad.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Then I went home and cried.  You cried.  Tears on your pillow. 
[03:46:00]  I cried.  It was all blurry through the telescope, through my tears.  See, he finally admitted he's not funny.  I told you.  He's not funny.  Let me post.  I knew the whole fucking time.  Copy, paste, copy, paste.  I told you guys, you could see my post from 2007.  I was the first one that said it.  I was the first one to claim he wasn't funny.  After I wrote, Anthony has AIDS.  But we're really fans of the show.  Yeah, we love the show.  They just don't get it. 
[03:46:30]  They don't understand.  They think we're not fans, but we really are.  I don't like when Jimmy has an opinion.  And you've got to have a little energy, too.  Because, you know, they're a higher energy type show.  Next.  Huh?  Kenny's convinced because Sam has to talk so fast that it makes his voice higher.  I'm trying to.  You don't have to do it.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, fuck that.  You know something?  Let's do it tomorrow.  We'll figure it out tomorrow.  See if it makes your voice higher. 
[03:47:00]  See?  I got just my.  Your focus?  Yeah, my focus.  Your telescope?  Your fucking tripod?  Yeah.  You got to jerk the old tripod?  No, it is weird, though.  Legit.  What is it called?  When you get one into the Lincoln Tunnel in Jersey, I can now see what the traffic's doing.  Because I have to use the Lincoln Tunnel a lot.  On the helix?  Yeah.  That's one of many things you can do.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe.  You should call in as a fucking, one of the CBS phone force. 
[03:47:30]  I was looking at the helix from my apartment going, oh my god, man.  This is some big delays today.  And you just see the people miserable in their cars?  You actually could see their faces.  Misery.  And I'm telling you, I live so fucking far away from that.  Yeah, you're across the river.  It's across the river.  That's fucked up, man.  All right, guys.  It was a fun show today.  Certainly was.  Jimmy's fucking video is killing already.  But just in case you don't know, on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, the latest video is called 
[03:48:00]  UFC's BJ Penn Puts Jim Norton in an armbar.  And I think Anthony suggested it, or maybe Jim.  I think it was Anthony.  You've got to watch this video frame by frame.  Because the faces Jimmy makes are classic.  Before and after.  We've got to screen cap every fucking frame to see Norton's faces he makes as BJ Penn is  putting him in an armbar.  And BJ Penn, after the show, admitted that he couldn't find Jim Norton's chin.  He couldn't find his chin.  He wanted to lock it in under Jimmy's chin.  But since that chin doesn't exist.  Yeah, Jimmy was lucky. 
[03:48:30]  That's all he got to do to him.  It's going to be a defense.  So check that out on the YouTube channel there.  On the YouTube.  And also the video, worst toupee ever.  I'm very proud of that one.  That guy is a fucking mess, if you haven't seen that one yet.  And other things.  A lot of things.  Of course.  Oh, look.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock doing the head cheese day thing is up there, too.  Oh, that's a good one.  I haven't seen any of the head cheese videos yet.  It's pretty good.  Yeah.  It's pretty fucking good.  I'll see that one.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Stick around for running, fellas. </pre>
