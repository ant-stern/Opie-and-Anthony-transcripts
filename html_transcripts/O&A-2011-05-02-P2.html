<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Sam Roberts hosting the "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment.  The broadcast heavily covered the concurrent news stories of Osama Bin Laden's death, the unexpectedly successful box office run of *Fast Five*, and the Royal Wedding, noting how each event overshadowed the others in the news cycle.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to salacious and vulgar speculation about Prince Harry's rumored breakup, using explicit language.

Stone Cold Steve Austin made a brief in-studio appearance and was further featured via a clip from his show *Tough Enough*, where he humorously recounted an incident involving defecating in his wrestling gear.  Roland's work securing guests was highlighted, with amusing anecdotes about his past failures in booking various personalities.  The show also discussed Eric's embarrassing Twitter mishap, where he prematurely announced the death of Obama instead of Osama Bin Laden.  A heated debate with 9/11 truthers, stemming from a previous remote broadcast, was revisited.  A minor, comedic argument erupted over Troy Kwan's preference for a medium t-shirt over a larger size.  A caller known as "Coke Logic" contributed to the discussion.  The segment concluded by announcing upcoming guests Morgan Spurlock and Guy Fieri.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is, After Opie and Anthony Live.  Troy is running around like a madman down the hallways of this building.  I would love to know what he's doing.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Opie and Anthony scampered out of here as quickly as they possibly could,  but the rest of us are going to be stuck here for a while. 
[00:00:30]  So why not keep the channel live?  And is there any guest, to me, no.  Is there any guest better than Stone Cold Steve Austin?  Another great Stone Cold performance.  The one guy who could take the attention away from Osama Bin Laden and his death  is Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Duty! I've got duty!  The greatest new drop of all time.  I mean, that came out of nowhere, Iraq.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  We'll play it again. 
[00:01:00]  Uh, alright.  Duty!  I've got duty!  He was talking about shitting himself.  We'll get into Austin more in a little bit,  but this Osama Bin Laden being dead story,  I don't know if you've heard.  Maybe I'm breaking the news to you.  But Osama Bin Laden was killed.  Yes, folks.  Unbelievably, I know.  The news hasn't really touched on it much.  But yes, Osama Bin Laden was killed.  The real problem with this, though, and I mentioned it on Twitter. 
[00:01:30]  By the way, people were asking me while the show was going on.  Yes, the photo of myself and Matt Lauer together on the Today Show is on my Twitter,  which is not Sam.  But the problem with the Osama Bin Laden killing is that it destroyed the news story that had been built for so many weeks.  Yes, and I mean, I think that the news people thought they were going to get at least another week out of.  They'd been milking it all weekend, and now it's dead because of this. 
[00:02:00]  That, of course, is royal wedding fever.  We all had it.  We've all passed it.  It's gone.  Because now we've all got Osama Bin Laden is dead fever,  which just doesn't have the same ring to it.  But we watched on Friday the royal wedding live on the show.  Jim was talking about all the different hats that were being worn.  My favorite was when Jimmy's looking at all the people there,  and he goes, who do you think has to take the biggest shit while they're in the ceremony? 
[00:02:30]  Well, there's got to be somebody in there that needs to move their bowels.  Roland's out there.  I wish they would come in here.  He will at some point.  He's slinging guest pitches.  Yeah, that's what I want to know.  Because last time we heard from Roland, I said, how'd the pitches go?  And he said, dick in the ass.  So I'd love to know how today went.  Oh, Roland's coming in.  And Roland, how did you...  No, good for you.  He dropped my picture of Stone Cold.  Did you pitch any guests?  Yes.  How did it go?  What a glorious day today, Samuel. 
[00:03:00]  You had a good day today.  Samuel, not only did whoever, which one called it, died.  Osama Bin Laden.  That's a guy.  I know, it's just a B story at this point.  Yes.  The real story is you got some guest pitches passed.  Oh, fantastic day, Samuel.  Fantastic day.  No dicks in the ass, then.  I remember that.  Yeah, that's what it is for Roland.  A pleasant day erases the memory of a not-so-pleasant day.  But Roland, right before you came in, we were talking about how this Bin Laden being killed,  and I was down at ground zero today, so I know that everybody's talking about it. 
[00:03:30]  Do you know what's more shocking than that?  What?  Fast Five made 85 million.  That really is shocking.  I can't believe that not more people are talking about that.  E-Rock, did you see Fast Five?  No, but I was following The Rock on Twitter all weekend, as he was doing the Dana White  gimmick of hiding tickets in certain cities.  Look, The Rock knows what he's doing.  He's no slouch, and now he's in an 85 million dollar movie.  I thought that Fast Five-  500 million worldwide, apparently.  Oh my god.  I thought Fast Five was going to be like, alright, The Rock is in some real duds now.  He's just-  He was cheesy.  I saw it. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah?  Very cheesy, but people in the theater roared with his lines.  They loved The Rock.  They clapped loud.  But if The Rock had made, realized that this movie was going to make Fast Five, if he knew  that his movie was going to make 85 million dollars in the first weekend, only in the United  States, you really think he would have agreed to do Wrestlemania?  I don't think so.  I don't think he was counting on his paycheck, because right now he's looking at this contract  to see how ironclad it is.  But regardless-  Wait, wait, so you think something's going to happen now that'll take him out of next 
[00:04:30]  year's Wrestlemania since they booked it already a year in advance?  Oh, yeah, he's going to try to find some loophole, because he's an $85 million man now.  There's no way he's doing this dumb wrestling match.  They're going to have to get Stone Cold to see what he's doing.  Get him back in the gym.  Not that he wasn't in shape, because the man is a god.  The guy's huge.  I know, he's enormous.  We'll talk about him in a minute.  First, as we said, the big stories of the weekend were, number two, Osama bin Laden dies,  number one, Fast Five makes $85 million.  Both of those stories took Royal Wedding Fever out of the headlines. 
[00:05:00]  Prince William and Kate, whatever her name is, I don't even remember anymore.  It's a $2 billion wedding.  Yeah, they spent $2 billion, and they only got one weekend, because they are gone.  Out of the headlines.  But that doesn't stop us.  Jim had a history.  The Royal Wedding coverage was not the first time that Jim has discussed royalty.  Or a third big story.  Or what?  The third story.  Which is?  Serious Chanter Channels. 
[00:05:30]  Well, that's on Wednesday.  That's not over the weekend.  What are you laughing at?  God damn you, Roland.  What happened was, Jim, I was about to say Roland.  That would have been a mistake.  Jim, it was not the first time that he had touched on royalty.  He's a man of many characters, a man of many faces, many voices.  And Prince Jimmy was one of those people who came out of the body of Jim Norton.  And Prince Jimmy debuted in 2007, years, four years, before the Royal Wedding even happened. 
[00:06:00]  Was there royalty before him?  No.  So he was the first.  It's Prince Jimmy on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, the Prince Harry thing, Jimmy?  Now they're saying he was dumped over text messages from a secret admirer.  Well, that's a secret admirer.  A chick he was fucking.  Secret admirer.  You don't just get the prince's cell phone to text him.  The prince's cell phone.  It's not a secret admirer.  Some fucking chick he was deep dicking.  Some fucking whore from Spencer. 
[00:06:30]  Some Spencer chick from Wales.  Spencer.  Yes, I was fucking the Dukas of...  The Dukas.  The Dukas of York.  Fucking the Dookie.  I fucking, yeah.  That fuck, whatever they fucking are.  They're all somehow royally connected.  To incest.  Yes.  Eating the ass of a distant cousin from Windsor.  And she texted him,  Sorry I shat in your mouth, Harry.  I got nervous when the phone rang.  And his girlfriend saw it. 
[00:07:00]  Who's been shitting in your mouth, Harry?  Would that explain your rosy red cheeks?  And then he relies on the same thing he's always relied on.  No one's been shitting in my mouth.  Me mum died.  No one's been doing nothing to me.  Don't you see the news footage?  Something in the tunnel.  Yeah, where did she get the prince's text phone number? 
[00:07:30]  Me father's dating a horse now.  Me mum died.  And me father's dating a horse.  He walks out of the barn with hay in his zipper.  No one's shat in my mouth.  Who's been shitting in your mouth, Harry?  Harry?  Talk to William.  He likes the transgenders, you know.  They call him Deep Dig Willie. 
[00:08:00]  So there's more info coming out about that story.  Yeah, wow.  It's the earliest from Hampton.  She'd like to know if you want to go to the match, Harry.  I can't.  I'm blowing off me girlfriend's birthday party.  For a bachelor party where a girl's going to suck a donkey's wanker.  Wanker.  Me mum used to like that. 
[00:08:30]  She used to throw up and a crown would fall off.  Did you know me mum died?  Here, put this in your mouth, love.  Oh, look.  Short fat old job's doing another tribute to me mum.  Wake at it.  She's dead.  The car was going fast in the tunnel.  Lick me balls high.  Slide a finger into me bum.  Me mum died.  Booty hoo-hoo. 
[00:09:00]  Boom-hoo-hoo.  Flick me nipple, would you?  Just so we can come.  She was sucking unclipped cock.  Dad was embarrassed.  She had an uncut one in her mouth when she hit the wall in the tunnel.  They found four skin in her teeth.  Me mum died.  Did I mention that?  Right.  One in the dumper then. 
[00:09:30]  That's right.  Put in two fingers.  Show the prince who's boss.  Me admirer.  Do you really admire her?  My grandmother's a cunt.  She just stands there with her hands folded.  The earless of Windsor took a shit on my face.  And it left a little rosy red box.  The English just love shitting on each other's faces.  In this bit they do.  Too bad there's not a writer in there to get this one-trick pony to go somewhere else with this one. 
[00:10:00]  Hey, someone is suggesting two princes, one cup.  Dad, pal.  And then someone is calling you, uh, Red Coat Jimmy is the bestest.  Red Coat Jimmy.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  It's Monty Norton's Flying Circus.  That bird's dead.  No, it isn't.  But me mum is. 
[00:10:30]  That bird was in a car in a Paris tunnel.  Very funny.  Very good, Jimmy.  Comedy timing of, uh...  Who do you mean?  The little fat man in there?  Who is he?  That's E-Rock, uh...  Harry!  Your Highness.  Yes.  Your Highness.  Your Hainey.  Your Hainey-us.  I like watching the polo matches because the horse's cocks are so big they remind me of me father's new girlfriend. 
[00:11:00]  Good timing, Eric.  Why don't you wait till 11.15 to play this?  He just woke up, sir, from his nap.  I know he did.  His face looks like English food.  Like a fat, boiled piece of meat.  I want to eat his face and talk about me mum dying. 
[00:11:30]  He's a little rosy-cheeked himself.  He's always hot.  This poor fat kid wakes up in the middle of the night and has to cool down.  He's certainly frozen at work, though, isn't he?  Oh, he rolls his eyes.  That's his idea of exercising.  Did you know that mum had four skin and her teeth when they found her? 
[00:12:00]  They said Dota used to cum buckets.  Tea time with little Jimmy Gorton.  That wasn't a disgrace to the British royalty.  Mum was fucking an oil salesman.  After ONA.  Live.  So you see, we were on the royalty bandwagon a long time ago.  It's after Opie and Anthony live. 
[00:12:30]  Roland, what's Stone Cold doing outside?  He's just standing around.  Duty.  I've got duty.  I don't think he's doing that, Eric.  He should be in here then, right?  Yeah.  I mean, he loves it.  He knows.  Like I said, can you autograph this photo for Sam?  And he goes...  Oh, you got my picture signed.  Yeah.  He goes, wait a minute, because I know this guy.  I like this kid.  Did he really?  He did say that.  Oh, my gosh.  I interviewed him last time he was here.  But he remembered.  He knew who you were.  What a great...  Did you hear that, Eric?  Yeah, but when he showed up, too, when I shook his hand, he said, good to see you again. 
[00:13:00]  So he could have just been polite.  No, he liked the air.  He goes, can you give me water?  Yeah, that's right.  But for me, it was more like, oh, yeah, I know.  He's a professional, right?  Yeah, and Eric was going through a resume.  He goes, remember, I saw you here, and he goes, just stop it, kid.  You're embarrassing yourself.  He goes, go shit your pants.  Roland, you'll like this.  We were talking with Stone Cold about shitting his pants.  I actually have the clip.  This is actually from his show, Tough Enough.  As far as I'm concerned, he is the best reality show judge-type person on television. 
[00:13:30]  What about the guy from Dance with the Stars, Iowa?  Better than the guy from Dancing with the Stars, Roland.  Oh, okay.  Jericho's not on that show anymore, anyway.  Here is, uh...  He's not?  No.  This is from the first episode of Tough Enough.  It's Stone Cold, and he's getting ready to eliminate a girl, and he tells her that he shit his pants.  We talked about it when we interviewed him earlier, but I wanted to play the clip for all of you.  He's still outside.  I know.  Get him in here.  I am sorry for...  I should have not been pulling up my pants, and I should have stayed more committed, but I hit the ropes as hard as I could. 
[00:14:00]  You weren't committed to running the damn ropes.  I was wrestling in South Africa against Yokozuna, 700-pound savage.  He picks me up, slams me in the middle of the ring, I fucked my pants.  What do you think I did?  Kept going.  I kept going.  I fucked my pants, and I kept working a match.  What do you think about that?  How do you...  What do you think about that, Roland?  I didn't hear it, but...  I didn't hear it, but...  He shit his pants.  That's hilarious.  And then he kept going.  Would you keep going? 
[00:14:30]  I do it once a week at work.  Eric, does that inspire you?  No.  There's a lot of air freshener being used in our room.  You think Roland's really shitting himself?  He doesn't stop.  He'll lean up back, and he'll just look at me.  I go, what?  And you hear...  And then he just laughs and runs out of the room.  So that's a shart, like Stone Cold was talking about.  A little bit?  Sometimes when you change clothes at night, is there a stain in the underpants?  Well, with Tide, and the new liquid Tide, it comes right out.  Duty!  I've got duty! 
[00:15:00]  So it's not a worry anymore.  Why is Stone Cold right outside?  Do you want me to ask if he comes in for one minute?  Yeah, ask him if he wants to come in.  We didn't get to talk to him afterwards.  Just see if he's, like, between interviews, if he wants you to just hang out here.  Eric, right?  Yeah, why not?  I mean, if he's going to be in the hallway, he might as well be in here.  I could actually play the Stone Cold music for Stone Cold.  I know.  Well, Ron Bennington's not here this week.  No, they...  Oh, yeah, that's right.  They're off this week.  So, I mean, if he wants to come in, I mean, we would throw to a bit, but just in case,  how embarrassing is it going to be when he turns this down? 
[00:15:30]  I'm looking at the monitor.  I'm looking at E-Rock in the other room right now, because I don't want Stone Cold to think  I'm looking at him in, like, because if he doesn't want to come in...  Wipe the drool.  Is it obvious?  A little bit.  I'll go right here.  There it goes.  It's off.  It's off.  There's Roland.  I've seen that show over there.  Which show?  Um, I think Larry Flick.  Larry Flick.  What's he going to talk to about Larry Flick?  Oh, Roland, what are you doing with your face right now?  He's still out in the hallway, though.  I know.  I asked him.  They said we're going to leave in one minute. 
[00:16:00]  Okay, well, now Spencer's getting him.  We should have asked...  Well, you wouldn't...  Who is this person that's with him?  When he was here last time, he was very friendly.  He would have come in last time.  Well, the last time he was here was with the WWE people.  Was that when they were doing Damages, or...  I think that was the name of the movie.  Um, no.  Yeah.  Probably.  He was doing that, and then we talked to him about the Stallone movie as well.  But this time, it's the USA people from the USA Network.  Well, USA is a fantastic network, but I wish I could have gotten to talk to... 
[00:16:30]  Everybody would...  I mean, who wouldn't have wanted to...  Who is it?  Oh, Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Wow, he's here!  He's here!  Stop complaining.  I heard you on the monitors.  Oh, Stone Cold.  How are you?  Oh, I'm doing fantastic.  My asshole's clinging.  How was Opie and Anthony today, Stone Cold?  Oh, I love those guys.  I love those guys for many years, and little Jimmy, yeah.  You like little Jimmy, too?  Oh, yeah, that little fucker's funny, and...  Ah, Stone Cold, they're telling you you gotta go.  You gotta go do Larry Flick now. 
[00:17:00]  I love you, Sam.  Oh, good to see you, Stone Cold.  How do you like that?  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Roland, you're back.  Did you get that done?  Yeah, I was just talking to the publicist real quick.  Thank you so much.  Like I said, I was down at ground zero.  Of course, the big news story today is what's going on with Osama or Osama Bin Laden,  depending on which news network you watch.  Or which pandita you read.  LOL.  Yeah, what happened with the pandita today?  Tell me about this, Roland, because I was walking around, I went to the bathroom, you  were in the lobby, and you were waiting in the lobby trying to see Matthew Morrison 
[00:17:30]  from Glee.  True or false?  False.  What were you doing there?  Discussing talent.  But did you happen to see Matthew Morrison from Glee?  OMG, yes, I did.  He's the teacher on Glee, Eric.  Yeah, Roland was very excited this morning.  I saw you with your Glee DVD, so I know what you were doing.  But look, Roland, I can't blame you for it.  Well, what Eric did today is now called the Geraldo.  Yeah, tell me about this, because I was going to the bathroom, and you told me, when you  saw me, what Eric did. 
[00:18:00]  And was this at the beginning of the show?  Yes.  Okay, so it's the beginning of the show.  We're talking about Osama Bin Laden.  He was dead.  We killed him.  The United States troops killed Osama Bin Laden.  USA.  And what happens, Roland, when we're talking about it here on Opie and Anthony?  He put the president's name instead of Osama.  He put...  Obama?  Yeah.  What did you write on the pad data, Eric?  When they started discussing this, I changed the pad data to, it was supposed to be Osama 
[00:18:30]  dead.  What did you write instead?  Well, while I was typing it, they were talking about the president, and on my error, I wrote  Obama dead.  You got what I did.  And then I loaded it, and it went, and I go, oh crap, and then I went and switched it,  but then everybody, by that point, everybody had taken photos, had Twittered it, I think  Wood Floor Liquor called in to write me out, so...  So, you're telling me that, because this announcement was made at 11 o'clock last night, so people,  like, Opie was asleep when the announcement was made, he wasn't part of the Twitter party 
[00:19:00]  that the rest of us were in on, um, you're, people could have gone to sleep at like 10  o'clock, and then their alarm goes off to the Opie and Anthony show, they wake up, and  thanks to Eric...  And Harold Rivera.  And Geraldo Rivera, they think something horrible's happened to the president.  Do you feel bad?  Um, I did, yes, I, I felt really bad, I do apologize, but then when I saw every major  news network had also done the same thing at one point...  You can't make fun of them for doing it. You can't make fun of somebody if you do it. 
[00:19:30]  I wasn't trying to do what they did.  Neither were they! They weren't trying to do what they did.  It is what it is.  I mean, you know, you gotta, it's, the problem for Eric is, he's got a lot on his mind, he's  running the show, at the same time he's listening to the show, at the same time he's thinking  about cake.  It has here, true.  No, I'm not thinking about cake.  Really?  No, I was not.  What were you thinking about?  The yogurt I had.  I figured it was my, yogurt?  Yeah.  What was in the yogurt?  What was on it?  Strawberry.  Oh, there's a new yogurt place, 16 handles, delicious, I found over the weekend. 
[00:20:00]  Where?  74th Natchez Dam.  What are you talking about yogurt places for?  I ran into it, it's phenomenal.  Well, Roland, I went down to Ground Zero.  Oh, wow, that's nice.  By the way, Eric.  Yeah?  I didn't get one compliment yet on all the jokes I was doing on Twitter late last night.  I wasn't up, so I didn't say it.  Well, could you look back while I'm playing this?  I'll go back and look.  And compliment me, please, thank you.  You were at Ground Zero with Matt Lauer.  Yes, I was hanging out with Matt Lauer and talking to some people. 
[00:20:30]  And this is going to have a point, because we played it on this show, but I just wanted  to replay it for everybody.  This was the youth at the rally.  It was Taylor and Johnny.  Now, Johnny reeked of alcohol, and Taylor was very non-violent.  So the two of them, and biracial.  So the two of them together made for quite a pair.  And this is setting up for something I promise.  But this is the youth and how they're responding to Osama Bin Laden being pronounced dead at Ground  Zero.  We're down at Ground Zero with Taylor. 
[00:21:00]  Taylor, what's the haps?  My roommate burst in at like 11, said, this happened.  One of the other roommates and I went down to Times Square, found that everything was  like really joyous and, I don't know, slightly violent.  There's a little bit of harshness, and that freaked us out.  So we got some candles and sat in a circle and sang kumbaya.  That was cliche, but I don't know.  It got a group of people together.  What's the vigil for?  A couple things.  People kept telling us what it was for.  It was for the people, you know, the victims of September 11th. 
[00:21:30]  It's for the soldiers.  But more than anything, for me at least, you know.  May I interrupt?  No, more importantly, it's for all Americans.  Any single American, if they live in Los Angeles, New York, or if they live in Alabama, or Ohio,  it doesn't matter.  It's for every single one of those Americans.  And that's important to remember.  What's your name?  I'm Johnny.  And it's important to remember that I'm Johnny and I'm an American. 
[00:22:00]  Based on what Obama has done and what we learned last night, how happy are you with the job he's done?  But Obama, I am fanatic about what Obama has done.  Because the fact is, he's done everything he said he would do.  Literally everything he said he has done, and he finished it tonight.  Now, do you think that it took Obama being in office to get this done?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Because he focused on what he had to do.  George Bush decided on a war that he had. 
[00:22:30]  We went in there for nothing.  For nothing that he actually told us he was going in there for, and we all know that.  But we're happy about Obama today.  Well, I've been happy about Obama since the beginning.  And I feel like today, there's no question that he's going to be re-elected.  Well, thanks a lot, guys.  So if we can say anything about the youth that we've learned, it's that while not all of them are terribly informed,  they all have an opinion, folks. 
[00:23:00]  Everybody who's young has to be passionate about something.  And why learn about it if you could just skip that and go to the fun part, the passion of the argument?  Eric?  I'm checking out your Twitter here, Sam.  Yeah?  I'm reading your updates and your jokes from last night.  What do you think?  Good?  Bad?  Very good.  Thank you.  This one here in particular.  You hear that Donald Trump is demanding to see Obama's, Osama's death certificate.  I didn't write that.  It says right here.  Not Sam.  That was Dane Cook.  That was everybody on Twitter.  I didn't write that. 
[00:23:30]  Well, it says right here.  Not Sam.  You're reading the wrong thing.  You said it a lot of times.  I didn't write that.  Are you Carlos Messia?  I didn't write it.  Eric, you know what?  I don't know why I even wrote that.  Not Sam on Twitter.  Check it out for yourself.  All I want is some compliments, Eric.  And this is what you, you son of a bitch.  Well, you're talking about the WWE draft here.  Well, that was much earlier.  No, you know what?  You're looking at my replies, not the things I posted.  You're just a dick.  I don't want to play this game anymore. 
[00:24:00]  Eric, here's another Sam one.  Yeah, look at Donald Trump is going to demand to see his birth certificate and death certificate.  LOL.  That's lame.  What's he talking about?  Eric, what?  I don't know.  Listen, what I was trying to get to was that sometimes these young people, they have these  opinions that they feel so strongly about, but no knowledge to base it on.  Like conspiracies.  Like conspiracies, Roland.  Yes.  Troy would fit in very well with Trump Johnny.  Why isn't he in here?  He's probably easy.  He only fits in the medium t-shirts. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, that was a big ordeal today.  Club Soda Kenny was really pissed at Troy today because Club Soda Kenny was giving out anti-social  network t-shirts from the tour, and they were sized large, XL, and...  Double XL.  Double XL for Roland.  And Troy got all pissy with Kenny and said, look, I don't want a large t-shirt.  I only want a t-shirt if it's in a size medium, which Kenny took offense to.  Kenny was just standing there, like an awkwardly long pause, and he just goes, what? 
[00:25:00]  Troy, Kenny was pissed.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  Because, I mean, you were looking a gift horse in the mouth.  I said, look, I'm not going to wear this shirt.  It's a large.  First of all, you're six foot one.  What are you doing to wear?  With your six two, what are you doing to wear medium t-shirts?  Well, I like a shirt that fits.  Why do I want it to be a tent?  It's not a tent.  A six two man should be wearing a large shirt.  They make it too big in here, and it looks tenty on me.  It doesn't.  Yes, it does.  That shirt is too small for you.  Well, I'm the one that has to wear it.  Like, what do you give a shit?  Well, you shouldn't be... 
[00:25:30]  If somebody says, here, I got you this shirt.  I got it for you.  Right.  Then you're like, no, thank you.  No, I said, do you have it in a medium?  Yeah, that's fucked.  Why is that fucked?  That's a rude thing to do.  Well, I'm not going to wear it if it's a large.  But what you do is you just be polite about it.  And you say, oh, thank you for the thought.  Then it's going to go in the fucking garbage.  Wouldn't you rather be wearing the shirt?  You're not wearing anything.  You just told him, no, take it away.  It has to be a medium or nothing for Troy Kwan.  I said, do you have a medium?  I actually want to wear the shirt.  Because if he gives me just a large and I take the large, you know what I'm going to do with it?  What?  It's going to be a fucking jizz rag. 
[00:26:00]  Well, why can't you just wear the large and wear an undershirt?  Well, I'm not going to do that.  You should.  Because I want a shirt to fit.  I like my shirts to fit.  Well, I'm sorry that the free t-shirt that Club Soda Kenny got for you...  Yeah.  ...wasn't fitted specifically for you.  Wasn't customized for you.  Then I would rather him take the shirt back and sell it or do whatever he has to do with it.  He got it for you.  Okay.  Well, I wasn't going to wear it if it was a large.  He doesn't think you were being very nice about it.  Well, he wasn't.  He wasn't.  With him, you have to word everything so specifically.  And you have to worry about everything you say. 
[00:26:30]  Because if you say the wrong thing, he won't talk to you for three months.  Coke Logic.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  We don't take many phone calls, but we'll take a call from Coke Logic.  No, I had to ask the student, like, is the phone lines open during this hour?  And he's like, yeah, sure.  So, like, cool.  Add to the show.  Last night, I was hilarious as well.  I liked your idea about going back and scrolling back.  Like, seeing what, I, uh...  Anyways, I was cracking up over the fact of everyone wearing American flags as capes. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  It seems to be, like, a huge trend.  And I got mine on now.  You do?  Fantastic.  Yes.  How did you feel, Coke Logic?  Today, you were mentioned on the show, we were doing Most Annoying Sound.  You were eliminated.  Yeah, I don't know how that works out.  I, I figure I'd do a bunch of stuff for you guys, and then you just rig the contest.  Yeah, we just give you the two grand, but it didn't happen.  Just walk right out with the money.  Yeah.  Do you feel, do you feel like Troy is being ungrateful to Club Soda Kenny, not wearing, 
[00:27:30]  not, because he told him, no, if it's not a medium t-shirt, I don't want it?  I think that anything that Club Soda Kenny offers or gives or says, you go along with,  because he's the best.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  And that's Club Soda Kenny on Facebook, and Coke Logic on Twitter.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  He didn't want to say goodbye.  He just hung up.  Yeah, Troy, it was not cool.  Now, where are you at with Osama?  I don't know.  I don't even know if I want to get involved.  You're not sure about it?  No, I mean, everything, it's shady. 
[00:28:00]  That's great.  A lot of bullshit happening.  Yeah, I mean, like, all of a sudden he's buried at sea, and, you know, let's forget about it.  It's cool, you know.  Well, I mean, I don't think anybody's forgetting about it.  It's on every news channel.  Well, I mean, let's not question it.  Let's, you know, it's cool.  He's put to sea.  We have to respect his, you know, Muslim traditions, and there you go.  Oh, yeah, it's done.  It's taken care of.  I mean, they did DNA testing.  Did they?  How'd they get his DNA?  He's never been in the United States.  They had his DNA from before.  But from where? 
[00:28:30]  His family.  Oh, really?  How did his family get his DNA?  It's the same DNA if you're in the family.  Is it?  Yes.  Okay.  You're just asking questions, and then I answer, and then you say, okay.  All right, well, then you must be right.  Conspiracies.  Roland loves conspiracies.  I know.  I do.  So are you, but isn't it more than likely, like, do you think they just randomly said,  oh, let's just say he's dead?  Two years ago, he died.  You think so?  Yeah.  Based on?  Troy's findings.  Well, I mean, look, there's a lot of people that say that he died years ago. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  You know?  Probably not, though.  But who knows?  Have you seen the body?  It's at sea.  Exactly.  So how can you know?  Exactly.  So you'll never know.  You don't know.  So whatever that tells you, just believe it.  Okay.  Because that's the truth.  Well, the president told me.  Okay.  Well, why would he lie?  What would he have to gain by lying?  But why would he pick Sunday night at 11 o'clock?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why?  Everybody's asleep.  No.  Everybody's calling in.  I'm not going to take everybody's phone calls.  Coke Logic is a special person. 
[00:29:30]  I'm sorry, you guys.  I mean, we don't have a phone screener for this hour.  Listen, Troy, hopefully, Opie and Anthony will talk to you about your conspiracies.  I don't care.  Because I don't have that much time.  I have nothing to say.  I really don't.  I don't have that.  Well, you just started talking with me.  Yeah, but I have nothing else to say.  And hopefully we'll extend that further, because I don't have a lot of time to get into it.  I have nothing else.  I have nothing else to...  Who's Alan Jones?  Alan Jones.  Oh.  Alan Jones.  Who, Roland, the talent booker on Earth, is Alan Jones?  He's a good conspiracist. 
[00:30:00]  He worked for the CIA.  Listen, like Roland said, maybe Troy is with a young drunk Johnny, who I met at Ground Zero,  who's saying Obama has done it all.  Are you a fan of Obama?  Ah, whatever.  I don't care.  They're all puppets.  You got questions.  No opinions.  No, they're all puppets.  You got questions.  Well, you know who else got questions?  Your pals, the 9-11 truthers.  Now, I know you're down with those guys.  You're down to ride.  We confronted them.  It was a long time ago, and it's been a while since we played this.  We're going to have to play it abridged, because we don't have a lot of time left on the show. 
[00:30:30]  But this was from back in 2007.  Actually, you weren't working for us in 2007.  I believe one of the truthers was Troy.  I don't know which one, but I believe it was.  We were confronted.  This is when we were doing the walkover from CBS to XM, when we were on KROQ.  And while we were broadcasting live on the sidewalk, a whole group of 9-11 truthers came up to us.  Yes, Iraq?  Yeah, just so you know, where we're joining this is right where it's getting really heated, 
[00:31:00]  because this thing went on for about 27 minutes.  Yeah, we were out on the sidewalk in the middle of winter for a half hour,  all because of Troy and his gang of misguided youths confronted us  because they didn't like that we believed 9-11 was probably not an inside job.  While imagine Poe was in his office warm, drinking coffee, eating cocoa.  Getting somebody to get him breakfast or something.  Watching martial arts flicks.  This is it.  The 9-11 truthers on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:31:30]  Do you honestly, as an intelligent person,  believe that the government was brilliant enough to pull off  faking phone calls with loved ones in answering machine message forms?  All I'm trying to say is it would be a lot easier and a lot more convenient  for me to take the assumption that I have faith in my country.  No, no, no, I'm not asking you that.  There are a lot of discrepancies.  All I'm asking for is a new investigation.  Well, what I'm asking you is, that's again, talk about parroting.  There's a good word to use, parroting, because that's also parroting.  You're doing exactly what he's accused everybody else of doing. 
[00:32:00]  You're parroting.  Now, I'm asking you, forget the rhetoric.  Do you really think, as a rational person,  that they faked relationships and phone calls  and that the family members bought it?  Like, your father or somebody could be faked.  He happens to be flying that day,  and the government's going to call you as the plane is going.  Does that make any sense?  I'm not taking one stand or another.  I'm just not going to mindlessly absorb what I'm told.  But you just did, and the fact that you're saying that it could have been faked,  you're absorbing, like, somebody's idea of something that's preposterous. 
[00:32:30]  And I'm saying, as a thinking person, does that make sense to you?  Like, no one likes the official version.  We don't like to think that we really lost 3,000 people.  Yeah, got caught with our pants down.  We completely, no one likes to think that.  That version sucks.  Believe me.  That version stinks.  I would love a different version.  Unfortunately, I really believe that's kind of the version.  So I'm asking you, like, and you're saying,  well, those phone calls, instead of saying,  yeah, that makes a lot of sense,  that would be a very difficult thing to pull off, 
[00:33:00]  you go with...  I can't say that it does make sense,  because it doesn't make sense to me.  So faked phone calls to relatives?  I don't know what the answer is, but it doesn't make sense.  Well, don't you know what the answer isn't?  That it's kind of hard to pull off fake phone calls?  Yeah, you can kind of throw that one out the window as being not feasible, or...  Look, I mean, I'm not saying that the planes were faked on the plane.  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that it's not...  But I'm not saying it's impossible not to fake phone calls.  Because we obviously do have the technology to do such a thing. 
[00:33:30]  I mean, but...  Where do you get that information?  These are just questions.  But would it just be easier to block the signal?  Like, for instance, if we have the technology,  which we maybe do,  to fake these voices and interpersonal relationships,  to convince wives and husbands...  A loved one.  ...that they've spoken to their loved one in a dying moment,  don't we have the technology just to block the signal,  so you don't have to worry about that?  I mean, why would they...  I mean, again, if we're discussing this,  why would they take 40 steps  when they could take one or possibly two? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Look, all I'm saying is  they're trying to make a big event.  But, dude, stick with me.  I'm going with what you're saying.  Okay.  But just try to work with me.  You're telling me I'm not thinking things out.  I am trying to think things out.  And there are certain things  that as a thinking person  don't make sense to me.  Why wouldn't they just block  cell and all plane signals  with that technology?  If going by that,  if they possibly had that technology,  why don't I just block the signal 
[00:34:30]  and save yourself  a tremendous amount of explaining  and possible error?  Thank God they didn't block the signal  because then people couldn't call Ticketmaster  and get their tickets for New Year's Eve,  Jimmy Norton at the North Fork Theater.  Absolutely.  Well, we all know that probably sold out already.  But you understand what I'm saying?  Like, why put all of those things to chance?  Maybe to really convince the fact  that it was Islamic terrorists.  Maybe to, I mean,  to bring that point home.  I mean, if you get rid of the speculation,  okay, well, you know, 
[00:35:00]  they called and it's obviously Islamic terrorists.  And you don't think Islamic terrorists  would be so extreme and so hateful  that they would do something like this?  Sir?  There is Islamic extremists.  There is terrorists that hate this country.  But the thing is,  I want to believe the official story,  but there's so many things just wrong with it.  They just don't add up.  But your version,  there's even more wrong with it.  There's no such thing as my version.  There's a lot of things that don't add up.  Or whatever.  Let's say the opposition to the official story.  Alternative research. 
[00:35:30]  It's so out there  and complicated  and impossible to pull off  that to stick to that story is silly.  But alternative research,  you're being given...  Hold on, hold on.  Alternative research.  Alternative research,  everything you guys are saying,  we're trying to somehow rationally,  like her thing with the phone call,  or, okay,  let's walk through that a little bit.  And all you guys are doing,  well, we don't know.  It's almost like you throw out a theory  and then when somebody slowly says, 
[00:36:00]  okay, well, let's talk about that,  when it's kind of proved to be ridiculous,  you go,  all right,  well, we're not saying that that's the case.  We just don't know what the case is.  I don't think you have proved it to be ridiculous.  You didn't think my example,  hold on,  you didn't think my example  about the phone thing was pretty good?  See, this is what the problem with you guys is.  You never can see the point.  You don't think the point I made to her  about calling your relatives  and faking a voice  in a personal relationship  is a lot more complicated  than blocking a signal.  You don't think that's kind of a good point?  Come on.  Come on.  Are you really going to tell me that? 
[00:36:30]  You're supposed to be a thinking man?  Here's what's going on.  You guys are getting real nitpicky  about little details  and trying to call us out  on this and that.  When there's a bigger picture here,  and maybe there's something we can agree on,  there's been a serious lack of media integrity.  Nitpicky?  I'm talking about your points.  There's been a serious lack of media integrity  surrounding 9-11.  Do you see what I'm saying?  This is what I meant about the trial.  I'll say that there's a serious lack  of media integrity, period.  Period.  Okay, period.  Just period.  And especially concerning 9-11.  I mean,  they went on the next day  touting the government's official story. 
[00:37:00]  There was a lot of...  There was no real investigation.  There was a lot of reports  that came out prematurely.  I watched that day,  just like everyone else did.  They were talking about  how more planes were in the air,  how this is going here,  other buildings were blowing up.  They all turned out to be false  because the media likes to jump the gun  to get the scoop.  There were planes on top of the White House.  To get the scoop on everything.  There were white planes  on top of the White House.  You know something?  It's never been mentioned.  You can see that there's a clip  on YouTube about it  that was reported on CNN  a little while ago  and they have a video  of a white plane 
[00:37:30]  that they say  was a B-52 bomber  but one of those doomsday planes  that was on top of the White House  and there's no mention of that  in the 9-11 official story either.  And I don't even know  what to think about that.  I don't know what to think  about that either.  That just blows my mind.  Who knows?  There was a white plane  on top of the White House.  Was it a plane that was at altitude  that was getting ready  to be brought in?  No, it was really low.  It was just right on top  of the White House.  You can see that clip on YouTube.  9-11 white plane.  I don't think...  Obviously, I don't think  we're privy  to every security measure  that the government  brought out  after that happened. 
[00:38:00]  So perhaps it was  some type of defense  that they put up.  I have no idea.  Yeah, I have no idea.  All I'm saying is...  There should be  another investigation  because there's so many  just unanswered questions.  There's so many things  that are just so strange.  Are there?  But he accused us  of being nitpicky.  And this...  Like, when you look at...  Well, it's a bigger picture.  No.  Not with every issue  you're talking about.  A bigger picture,  a higher morality  is not what we're discussing.  We're talking about  specific things  and I'm listening  to what you guys are saying  and you're saying  I'm being nitpicky.  That was a very valid question. 
[00:38:30]  You're accusing the government  of mimicking voices  convincingly enough  to convince relatives  that they've spoken  to a loved one  in a moment of death.  And I'm saying,  wouldn't it be easier  to do this?  And you're saying  I'm being nitpicky  and that you've somehow  investigated further.  It seems to me  like you don't like  to concede a point  or you don't like  to be shown  that possibly  the way you're arguing  is not accurate.  You don't seem to like that.  You seem to...  You're so desperate  to hold on  to this thing.  I think the big point here  is that we need  a new investigation.  You guys could use  your celebrity  to call for a new investigation 
[00:39:00]  and to do some serious research  into this subject.  I've already talked to you.  You've convinced me of nothing.  You guys are cowards.  I'm sorry.  Oh, don't be so silly.  You're being a little boy.  You're cowards.  You're being a little boy.  Because you don't want  to look into this seriously.  Did mommy and daddy  not listen to you enough, son?  You're afraid for your jobs  if you start talking  about 9-11.  Oh, little boy.  Little boy.  That's not the truth.  We're afraid for our jobs  but it ain't 9-11.  Believe me.  That's not the truth.  And I think you know that.  You really think  that we're afraid?  You ridicule people of it.  I am the one,  you silly little boy 
[00:39:30]  who doesn't know,  who screamed,  let's get 9-11 people  on here.  Why are you calling me a boy?  Because you're being  a little boy.  You called me a coward.  I'll call you a little boy.  Take it,  little bearded angry man.  I get it.  You're angry, man.  I get it.  The government's bad.  I know I'm a piece of shit.  Oh, is he angry?  No, no.  Be angry, son.  Come here, son.  Be angry, little boy.  Whoa.  The angry young man  walked away.  Do you see?  Do you see?  Afraid for our jobs.  I am the one that said  when we brought 9-11 people  on at first, 
[00:40:00]  there was something  about the Pentagon video  that I didn't like.  I started talking about it  on XM and said  let's get people  and talk about it.  Right.  So that's just uninformed  and he's walking away  and I hope you have this  on film  because he was getting  his ass handed to him  in an argument.  After ONA,  live.  So that's what happens  when truthers confront you  on the streets.  Thank God  Opie, Anthony, and Jim  were prepared for it.  Specifically Jim.  Jim, when he gets  a point of view  and there are people  who contradict,  especially something  that controversial, 
[00:40:30]  that sort of divisive,  he's ready to argue  at any times.  So, yeah,  a bunch of kids  coming up to him  and talking about  the truth movement  was not the brightest  thing to do.  Especially, I mean,  can you imagine  how irritated  that kid must have been  when Jim called him  an angry little boy?  Oh, you little boy.  I mean, that is just  the most dismissive,  condescending thing  that a person could say.  Roland, we were just  looking a minute ago 
[00:41:00]  at Troy's picture  with Ian Halperin.  Yes.  I don't know what that is.  Eric must have put it up.  Whoa, what's that?  Eric's putting up  cleavage shots now.  Troy has a way  of getting people riled up.  The phones were all ringing  when Troy was in here.  People are feedbacking in.  Troy Kwan is a jackass.  They had his body,  WTF,  of course they got his DNA.  They had his sister's DNA  who died in America.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I mean, people tried 
[00:41:30]  calling in  and when they couldn't  get through  it got so pissed off  that they had to feedback.  Did Troy convince you, though?  No, no.  I was just trying to feed it  and give Troy ammunition.  You can pump him up  and he goes further.  So you can get him  to keep going.  I call that,  I do the Sam Roberts.  But not on your level,  just a little bit.  You just add fuel to the fire.  I do.  It's no big deal.  Well, Roland,  I hope you have  a continued day of success  with guest bookings.  Thank you.  Are you going to push your luck  or are you going to call it?  I'm tapping out today. 
[00:42:00]  We got Morgan Spurlock tomorrow,  correct?  Yeah, and Guy Fieri.  Big show, big show.  Morgan Spurlock  from the greatest movie  ever sold,  which looks awesome,  and Guy Fieri  from my favorite show,  Diners.  Triple D.  Triple D, whatever.  Diners, drive-ins,  and...  Minute to win it.  Dives.  Dives, that's what it is.  E-Rock, I'm sure you know.  Roland E-Rock,  thank you so much.  Ron and Fez are on vacation  this week,  but listen to their  best of anyway.  Hello, Sam Sismefees.  Freaking impression.  Man of a thousand voices.  Listen to the best of.  Oh, here's the one.  Because it's the best of. 
[00:42:30]  Liam won't come in here.  He's got no balls.  We'll see you tomorrow  with more Opie and Anthony  and then after  Opie and Anthony live.  The Opie and Anthony show  is now over.
