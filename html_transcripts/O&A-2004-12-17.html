<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with bizarre discussions about exercise equipment and the hosts’ fantastical desire to clone themselves for self-sexual gratification. This segued into a news story about cloned sheep and the implications of human cloning, interspersed with highly offensive language and a mention of a substantial FCC fine resulting from a previous stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Jim Norton arrived late, prompting discussion about the studio’s temperature issues. Club Soda Kenny, also present, teased a major announcement.  The main focus then shifted to an upcoming eggnog drinking contest, sponsored by MiFi, with detailed discussions of rules, shot sizes, and predictions of widespread vomiting.  Pat, a large man resembling Jim Norton and a veteran of past contests, entered the studio, recounting a recent arrest for driving with a suspended license.  Kenny read an email expressing his concerns about an upcoming Las Vegas tour bus trip.  Several new Club Soda Kenny theme songs were played and critiqued. A phone call from a listener, Lady Di, was met with skepticism and accusations of lying by the hosts regarding her claims of listening through another listener, Marion. The discussion circled back to the eggnog contest, including side bets and debates about deserving recipients of MiFi devices beyond the winner (mentioning regular callers Marion and Starker Patty). The segment concluded with further eggnog contest discussion and the playing of the song "Get Your Cock Out," all punctuated by offensive language, sexual innuendo, and crude jokes.

The next segment began with an angry call from Jared in Maine, complaining about difficulties in entering the eggnog contest, blaming executive producer Ben for misrepresenting email counts while praising Steve's responsiveness.  This led to a harsh critique of the hosts' former radio station, WNEW, and its post-Opie and Anthony management.  Audio clips of a heavily intoxicated Frankie Blue, a WNEW program director, were played, showcasing his on-air mistakes, including using KTU's call letters instead of WNEW’s.  The audio highlighted Frankie’s slurred speech and incoherence, along with nervous interjections from board operator Earl.  The hosts speculated on Frankie's subsequent firing, which was confirmed with a short audio clip.  A brief call from Doug, a contestant who flew from Tempe, Arizona for the contest, emphasized his commitment. This segment also included tangents on a shark attack in Australia, listener "fuck you" calls, Little Jimmy Norton's celebrity encounters (Michael Imperioli and near-encounter with Tony Sirico), and a coworker watching pornography at work. Kenny’s big announcement was postponed until after the eggnog contest.  The segment concluded with preparations for the contest.

The eggnog contest itself took center stage in the following segment.  Discussions revolved around Ellis, a contestant who had recently undergone gastric bypass surgery, raising concerns about the potential dangers of alcohol consumption following the procedure. Callers shared anecdotes and a self-proclaimed nurse contributed to the discussion (though his credibility was questioned).  Tangents included discussions of sexual harassment (with a humorous audio clip), a contentious interaction between Opie and Ben Stein, and contest rules and prizes (XM satellite radios). A humorous, nonsensical song about a Chevy and the police was also played.  The live eggnog contest commenced with ten participants, with the hosts providing running commentary on their reactions, strategies, vomiting, and eliminations, while the contest rules were refined during the competition.

The contest continued in the next segment, featuring nine or ten contestants, including Doug from Arizona, participating in multiple rounds of double eggnog shots.  Pat emerged victorious after consuming over 60 double shots before finally vomiting.  The commentary included graphic descriptions of contestants' physical reactions and the eggnog's consistency, along with audience participation via signs outside the studio window.  At least one person in the studio vomited, besides the contestants, and Pat received the MiFi.

The final segment focused on the contest’s aftermath. Jared won a MiFi after participating. Pat’s repeated vomiting was a major source of comedic commentary, with graphic details shared.  Ben's absence during the contest drew criticism. Numerous “F U” calls followed, filled with vulgar insults.  Music was played, including a Brother Joe song and a song about Jim Norton’s flatulence. Club Soda Kenny announced his appearance on HBO’s *Inside the NFL*.  The show concluded with vulgar songs, listener calls sharing their "What Did We Learn" takeaways, a musical mashup, and final sign-offs.

[00:00:00]  Older. Official rules and complete entry and price details at XMRadio.com.  Now through December 31st, 04. Void where prohibited.  I try to work out. I work out on one of those.  You ever seen those? Those little things on TV?  Not sold in stores, Jan, because it's a piece of shit.  What if it's right under the bed where it'll be forever?  A no-D track.  Where you're going with a glider and that thing that goes back and forth like that. 
[00:00:30]  I got the idea by smoking a lot of pot.  And then I slid across the minoleum floor to get some Captain Crunch.  And that's where I came up with a lazy fuck.  My aerobic system.  I meant Billy Blanks.  I meant Billy Blanks.  Come on, man. Let's go. Come on. Yeah.  Those girls. Come on. Yeah.  That guy looks like a crook. He should have crime aerobics or some shit.  Let's run from the police, everybody.  Let's run from the police. 
[00:01:00]  There you go. Run for the police.  All right. Okay. Let's walk.  Let's cause no attention. Come on. Let's walk.  Okay. Let's run for the police.  Let's climb the fence.  Let's climb the fence.  Let's grab the purse.  Let's grab the purse.  Let's stash the dope.  Let's stash the dope.  I want you to be sweating like you got mace in your face, bitch.  Come on. Let's go.  Your system. I can do it.  Speaking of animals, of course, the news, I guess, of the month or maybe even the year 
[00:01:30]  now is that sheep that they cloned.  They're cloning animals and they're talking about maybe they can clone humans, which I  think is a good idea because I would like to clone myself because I would like to have  sex with myself.  Hey, I know what I like.

By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listeners.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole? 
[00:08:00]  You're just a tool.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk Mick friend.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:08:30]  Yes, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program, the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Thank you, XM Satellite Radio.  Thank you.  If it wasn't for you, I don't know what we'd be doing.  Right?  Could be.  Who knows?  I know what you'd be doing.  You'd be telling a bunch of people over at another company, no, you're very valuable.  Mel won't fire you.  Are you sure?  I hope not, because I have a cock I want to suck in. 
[00:09:00]  Wow, you just won't let that go.  No, I won't.  No, he won't.  I didn't even see you walk into the studio.  Jim Norton, everyone.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Sliding in right under the wire.  Yeah, I went to bed at 11.30 last night, too.  11.30?  11.30?  That's early for you?  Oh, yeah.  I used to sleep during the day, but I bet at 1.00, too.  Blah.  Like a vampire.  Glad it's so warm in here.  I bundled up today.  I know.  Well, I...  Now it's blazing in here.  We might have figured out the heat thing.  Really? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, we had a little discussion after the show yesterday, and it's much better in here.  Mars helped us out, yeah.  Not if you're wearing heavy shirts and undergarments.  I see that.  Yesterday was too cold.  Today's too hot.  Now I'm blazing.  I'd rather have it too hot than too cold, though, right?  True, true, true.  All right.  Well, today's the big day.  Oh, Club Soda Kenny in the studio.  Yes, Kenny.  Can I say hello to everyone and a wonderful good morning?  Sure.  I think you just did.  Thank you.  And may I also comment, if I may, I see that little Jimmy has a Gold's Gym sweatshirt on. 
[00:10:00]  Yes, he does.  How are your workouts going?  Not bad, actually.  I lifted this and put it on.  It looks like a workout just to put that on, man.  It's the nerve of me to wear this shirt.  It's like the heaviest sweatshirt I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, well, I figured it would be freezing in the studio again, so I put this on, and  now it's hot.  It's just going to be puke.  You want it nice and warm.  Oh, that's a good point.  We should have iced the studio because of the puke.  Oh, the smell?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, today is the big day. 
[00:10:30]  We're doing the eggnog drinking contest for the MiFi, the portable satellite radio that  everyone is talking about and raving about, and stores are selling out of this damn product,  depending where you are.  Yeah, this has been on my mind all night.  Has it?  Yeah, I've been thinking, because I...  Did you see all the creeps outside waiting to get in?  I did.  How did you get in the building, Opie?  Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  Made a big scene out front.  He did?  Yeah, parked his car right in front.  Wouldn't let us leave the car until he opened the doors. 
[00:11:00]  You know, gave me the full treatment today.  Little show?  Yeah.  Little show for everybody.  It's really embarrassing, actually.  I walked in with my hood down, like, pulled way down, and the collar of my jacket pulled  way up, and no one even noticed.  It was just, like, barely a slit left from my eyes, and I made the corner real fast, and  I just hear them all talking and joking and stuff.  But they didn't know.  Well, they're ready to go.  Yeah, I know.  They're so ready to go.  We're just getting the paperwork together, and I think we're going to do this contest earlier 
[00:11:30]  than later today.  Animals.  There's a bunch of animals out there, and they all want to win the MiFi.  I saw, like, a laboratory out there earlier with people marking cups, filling them with  water and marking it.  Oh, yeah.  We're very technical today.  Yeah.  You don't want somebody getting a little more than somebody else, maybe puking a little  earlier.  Well, here's the deal.  It's the eggnog drinking contest.  The contestants, they're making their way up to the fifth floor here, and they're going 
[00:12:00]  to have to drink eggnog, a double shot eggnog, every minute.  Every minute.  That does look like a lot.  There's a whole system that is in place.  We've got the cups marked.  We're talking about who's going to be pouring the eggnog.  We've got the puke buckets all over the studio already.  Plastic is down.  The shot size is like the shot that you get at the bar from your dopey friend when you  just wanted to do a shot, and then, you know, Ben comes over with this big half a glass 
[00:12:30]  of booze, and you've got to down that, and you didn't want to.  That's kind of what the shots are like.  Double shots are a lot of liquid.  I know.  The first few are going to be no problem, but.  Oh, the first few, they're all going to be, you know, counting on getting that mi-fi.  They're going to be laughing.  But I think 30 minutes into the contest, it's going to get very interesting.  You think anyone will make an hour?  You think anyone will make 60 shots without puking?  There are 100 shots if it's a double shot.  It's like 120 shots.  Well, that's right.  Well, I meant, yeah, 60 cups, I guess. 
[00:13:00]  You're right.  That's a lot.  No way.  No one's going to make 60?  We should bet.  120 shots of eggnog.  What's the over and under?  We should just have some side bets.  I'm saying we start getting some puke action at about, I think, probably close, I would  say probably into 20, between 20, 25 shots.  That's what we should bet on.  I say you start really getting some puke action there.  You think people start puking around 20 minutes in, 20 to 25 minutes in?  Yeah.  I think they're going to make 30 minutes. 
[00:13:30]  No, I don't know.  That's a lot.  30 shots is 60 ounces.  You know, you're talking one of those big bottles of soda that you get at the store full  of eggnog.  I don't know.  Oof.  You know, half of these psychos have been up since last night drinking alcohol.  Yeah.  Yeah, they always are.  It's such a heavy, thick drink, eggnog.  I'm good for like a half a cup and I'm finished.  Eat this stuff.  That's the beauty of it.  It's like dick snot.  Thank you, Kenny. 
[00:14:00]  We have all the new Club Sort of Kenny songs we've been holding back on until Kenny arrived  at the station again.  Yeah.  He wants to plug something, though.  I have a big announcement to make exclusive for just XM high voltage listeners.  We don't like saying high voltage anymore, Kenny.  Oh, virus spreaders.  Yeah.  Well, we'll just call it Channel 202, the Opie and Anthony channel.  That's right.  That's right.  So, a huge announcement exclusive to our show on XM Satellite Radio.  You are correct, sir.  All right.  Whenever you're ready, Kenny. 
[00:14:30]  No, I'm teasing it.  You're going to tease it all morning?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're just starting to wake up now, getting into the swing of things.  You know, let's have people puking first and then I'll make my big announcement.  So, your big announcement will be the showstopper?  Yeah.  That's right.  I know how to bring the show down.  Well, we have four Club Soda Kenny songs.  I don't know which ones we've played and which ones we haven't.  I am overwhelmed at the response of my tens of fans that sent music in. 
[00:15:00]  By the way, we like all the emails you've been sending to corporate on our behalf.  Oh, I know.  It keeps them completely distracted.  Their computers must be broken.  They don't respond.  Well, Kenny's in charge of everything when Anthony and I and Jimmy Norton hit the road.  That freak is here again?  Oh, yeah.  They're already showing up with their food?  That's the same food you brought last time.  Oh, there's chicks.  I see chicks.  I see chicks. 
[00:15:30]  There's going to be a chick in the contest?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Is it necessary?  No, we know King Kong Bundy.  He shows up to everything.  Is it necessary to have them gawking through the window the whole time?  Wait, the guy was in prison?  Oh, shit.  One of our guys was in prison, Keith?  It seems that, well, the last time he was here, his van got towed, and he owed like $875.  Yeah.  And then when I just saw him right now, it seems that he didn't know his license was suspended  as well, and he spent a day and a half down in the tombs after he got arrested, and that 
[00:16:00]  would be his booking sheet.  Yeah.  It's a very similar face to Jimmy Norton's.  Yeah, this is it.  Would he be more comfortable than if we just took the eggnog and threw it on his back?  This guy looks like a 400-pound version of Jim Norton, just to give you the visual.  And last time he showed up for the Cherry Dart Contest, he decided it was okay to just  park his van right in front of the station here on 57th Street, and he got towed, right?  What's your name again, bro?  Pat. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, Pat.  What's up?  If this doesn't look like a sex crime sheet.  Yeah.  So what happened to you?  Oh, I made a left turn onto Lexington Ave, one of those through streets.  How dare you?  Left turn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cop pulled me over, and he goes, Pat, your license has been suspended, but I have a New  Jersey license, and I got no points.  He goes, no, your driving privilege in New York was suspended, and I'm going to have to  arrest you.  Oh, okay.  They take you in for a suspended license now? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, they do.  For suspended?  Mm-hmm.  They used to just, yeah, I got that taken care of.  Yeah, no, no.  Might I write you a ticket?  Nowadays.  Can they write you a ticket, or do they have the option?  No, no, they're not really supposed to.  Wow.  Sometimes you do, but got to watch that then.  Yeah, he, uh...  I used to have a suspended license all the time.  Did you enjoy your time down there?  Oh, yeah.  If I heard the words, yo, B, one more time, I was going to lose it.  Well, the tombs, it's a scary place, obviously.  We've had a bunch of our guys arrested for the voyeur bus incident.  As a matter of fact, little Jimmy Norton spent 28 hours in the tombs. 
[00:17:30]  Anything happen to you down there?  No, I made some nice friends.  I think I was going to learn how to cook, because they were asking me about tossing salad.  That old gag.  That old gag.  That old gag.  That's great.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  So what did you bring us?  Pastries from Majors and Lindhurst.  All right, pastries.  The good stuff.  And that's stuff you brought last time, didn't you?  Yeah, I heard Jimmy chewing them on air.  Yeah, he enjoyed your party mix.  Yeah, he enjoyed your party mix.  I heard me in an apple.  I wanted to stop that.  Did anybody bother you? 
[00:18:00]  No one bothered you in jail, did they?  No.  He looks like you.  You don't bother him.  No, he's a 400-pound version of you, man.  You're like the mini-me to him.  Get in my belly.  When they searched his van, they found those bloody child sneakers, like in the Star Chamber.  Oh, wow.  I wanted to have him killed.  Right on, man.  All right.  Well, thanks, Pat.  We'll get to you in a little while.  Are you an official contestant today?  Why, yes, I am.  All right.  Congratulations for getting in.  He's got to be maybe the front runner.  He's the biggest guy here.  You've got to think he's got the biggest stomach, right? 
[00:18:30]  But does he drink any whole thing?  You think you could get a gallon of eggnog down?  Easy.  Easy, he says.  Easy.  All right.  He did pretty, you came in, what, second?  Second in the Cherry Darts.  Second in the Cherry Darts.  Down here for everything.  There wasn't a second place.  No, no second place.  These guys are proud of where they place in our goofy contest.  All right.  You'll be known as second place in the Cherry Darts contest.  Cool.  Guy.  There you go.  Guy.  Runner-up guy. 
[00:19:00]  Pat, piece of shit.  Or that, too.  So, Kenny wrote an email to Washington because the idea was floating around that we were going  to take a tour bus to Vegas.  Yeah.  And I guess we're not taking the tour bus to Vegas anymore?  I would really guess we're not.  Based on the consensus of the people on this show?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  O&A should always travel by Greyhound.  Yeah.  A glorified Greyhound bus. 
[00:19:30]  Club Soda Kenny took it upon himself to be very, very bothered by the fact that we might  be taking a tour bus to Vegas.  And he wrote this email.  You want to read it on the air, Kenny?  Okay.  And I don't understand why they don't write you back.  I just don't.  People down in Washington don't understand how important you are to our radio program.  Program.  Just the highlighted stuff?  Well, you can start from the beginning if you want.  No?  Go to the highlight?  The highlight is great.  All right.  The highlighted stuff.  Okay.  Because, now, Kenny, you know, did some math in his head about how long it would take 
[00:20:00]  to get from New York to Vegas on a bus.  You did math?  Yeah.  Well, no.  I actually have a Rand McNally disto map.  Because back in the day, when I used to spend a lot of time on a tour bus, we would  have to calculate how long it is from here to there.  A disto map.  You follow?  That's what it is.  A Rand McNally disto map.  Which is the distance, yes.  Right.  Right.  Gotcha.  Right.  Right.  You follow?  Totally.  Okay.  So, here is part of my email that I sent to Corporate XM Headquarters that went unanswered. 
[00:20:30]  It is at least 2,536 miles from New York to Las Vegas.  Going 70 miles per hour, that will take 36 hours to drive there, and that is driving nonstop,  which is impossible.  Even if you had two drivers, you couldn't do that, because there are federal regulations  regarding how far and how long someone can drive commercially on the interstate. 
[00:21:00]  Minimally, you have to stop for meals and the bathroom, because in parentheses, you can't  dump out on a tour bus, in parentheses.  This is true.  This was to corporate.  The drive would take at least three days, which means hotels for two nights in different cities  along the way.  Well, they wanted us to sleep on the bus.  Yeah.  Oh, sleep six comfortably.  It sleeps six comfortably. 
[00:21:30]  Well, no, I'll tell you.  The tour buses have 12 coffin-sized bunks, and that's what it is, and there's a little  hangout room in the back of the bus and a little one in the front of the bus, you know,  and then they have the 12.  In the middle are all bunks.  Yeah.  It's a curtain, right, that hangs, like, almost like a piece of cloth that hangs in front  of your bunk.  Yeah.  You ever seen Das Boot?  Ever watched that?  It's probably similar to the submarine, World War II Nazi submarine sleeping conditions.  That's exactly it, how it is on a boat or a submarine. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Would you like me to continue reading?  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay.  It's very fascinating.  And besides that, how are you going to broadcast a radio show for four hours a day from the  road?  Is the tour bus equipped with a radio station?  You're such a dummy.  I love it.  You're big and stupid.  That's right.  All right.  It's no secret.  Do you stop and broadcast from truck stops or broadcast from different radio stations 
[00:22:30]  in different cities?  Well, that was kind of the idea, yeah.  It was.  Yeah.  We'd stop at a truck stop somewhere between here and Vegas and do a four-hour radio show.  And would a vehicle carrying the equipment be following the tour bus?  Is that what they were banking on?  Probably, yeah.  I don't know the technical details, but sure.  Yes.  So, Kenny was very concerned.  Yeah.  And then I sent a follow-up one yesterday.  Yeah?  Yeah.  About, like, you know, tour buses are for reality TV shows.  I like the way he thinks. 
[00:23:00]  Like, for road rules or something?  Yeah.  You know what it is?  It's a little wacky thing to do.  Put us out on the road.  But then Kenny's like, you don't know what kind of drivers you're going to get.  Yeah.  So then you're paranoid the whole time, you can't really sleep, so then you have to have  a guy sitting next to the driver to make sure he's not nodding off.  True.  White line fever.  Also, your funny line was about how they have to have limousines the whole time they were  in Vegas.  That cracked me up. 
[00:23:30]  Yes, that was another email I sent that went on answer.  There's been so many.  I mean, there's been quite a few sent by Kenny.  Right.  They just don't like Kenny in Washington.  I know that for a fact.  It's pretty obvious.  But they have to take you seriously because you're one of our guys.  And you take care of us when we hit the road.  I am a representative of the O&A empire.  Absolutely.  All right.  Well, as the people get their paperwork done for the eggnog drinking contest, we've got  some new Club Soda Kenny theme songs.  We're trying to find the best one.  Yes. 
[00:24:00]  Have there been any standout songs yet, Anthony?  I don't think so.  I think they all have a common thread.  Right.  And I don't think anything really stands out here.  All right.  I think this is Club Soda Kenny's theme, Raven vs. Flood.  I don't know what that means.  It's written down on the post-it here.  But let's take a quick listen.  I got a theme song.  Yo.  Yo.  He's big and he's so big.  Yeah.  He is big.  Yeah.  And he's so big.  He's big and he's so big. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  That's right.  Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny.  Yo.  Yo, dawg.  He's on the money.  That had potential.  Kind of cool.  It's just too hard to hear because the music was very loud and I don't like when Kenny's  vocals are so low.  Yeah.  No.  He should stand out.  And if we're going to play this every time you're in the studio, you know, it's a little  distorted and it's not crystal clear.  Yes.  Yeah.  But I like the effort from that guy.  I like it.  It was short.  Yeah.  Clean up your act, pal.  You might make it.  Had the big and stupid in there, which is important. 
[00:25:00]  Yes, that is important.  That's no secret.  Yeah.  All right.  The next song is from Chemistry.  You might remember Chemistry from the hit song, Get Your Cock Out.  Where is Get Your Cock Out?  Maybe we should play that first.  Get your cock out.  Get your cock out.  You think you can find it real fast, Ben?  All right.  Ben is herking and jerking through the pile.  Looking through 13 CDs accidentally.  Just knocking them over.  Donkey Sausage is here.  She is.  Looks like her anyway.  She's here.  Wow.  We got a lot of people outside the studio already. 
[00:25:30]  They're milling about.  There's a lot of girls.  How many girls are going to be in this contest?  Well, this is not a bad contest for women.  Just a little eggnog.  It's something the women like to do.  It's cute.  You think a girl has a chance at this?  Yeah, they're used to gobbling the go.  That is true.  If you wanted to keep it down, just make a fist.  Write bad words on her forehead and smack her in the mouth while she's trying to drink it.  Toilet seat over the head.  Eggnog happy.  All right.  Well, we'll play Chemistry's Club Soda Candy song. 
[00:26:00]  We're trying to find Get Your Cock Out.  But here's Chemistry from whackbag.com.  Here comes Club Soda Candy.  He's big and stupid.  Six foot five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big.  Hope you're ready.  Because here comes Club Soda Candy.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's not bad.  Very quick.  That's it.  Short and sweet.  As he's walking in the studio, you would play something like that.  Well, that's all we're looking for, right?  Nothing too crazy.  What do you guys think?  Well, next.  Not bad.  Not bad. 
[00:26:30]  That might be the best one we have so far.  I like Chemistry with a K.  Yeah, he's good.  KH.  Ooh, is that how he spells it?  Yes.  All right.  And we got the Heavy Metal Club Soda Kenny theme song.  Heavy Metal.  Let's try this one.  He's big.  He's stupid.  He's Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you.  Also, not bad. 
[00:27:00]  Not bad.  I'd say Chemistry's right now.  Wait, I want to listen to Chemistry again real fast.  That last one has like a wrestling thing.  Big and stupid.  Six foot five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big.  Hope you're ready.  Because here comes Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you.  I might like that one better.  That's cool.  Let's listen to Heavy Metal real fast again, too.  He's big.  He's stupid.  He's Club Soda Kenny. 
[00:27:30]  Thank you.  That doesn't explain it as much as Chemistry, though.  Chemistry's good.  It sounds...  It almost has like an early NWA sound to it.  Yeah.  You know, there are a couple of their songs that have that fun kind of background music  to it.  Like a bitch is a bitch.  And it describes Kenny better.  Yeah.  You know, how he skips, and he's 6'5", and he'll kill you, and he's stupid.  Good stuff.  It's all in there.  And then the final one today, Anthony, is by our own Eric.  Sex Bagel.  Stop it.  I can't slash Hawk.  What?  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  And he's very confident in his.  You're feeling confident about it.  Did we finally get your cock out?  You got it loaded right there.  Okay, you got that loaded.  We're going to go to break with that.  But here's our own Eric.  Sex Bagel.  All right.  His Club Soda Kenny theme song.  Hens love roosters, geese love ganders, everyone else loves...  Club Soda Kenny.  That's pretty good.  I didn't say it was good.  I just said it was good.  Well, that's not bad.  Not bad.  Wow.  He piled on to defend it.  Wow.  Before anyone said a peep.  We're letting it settle in. 
[00:28:30]  I know.  I was like...  Hey, I didn't say it was good.  I was letting it soak in, and then we all paused to think.  He immediately went defensive.  He got a real preemptive strike on that one.  He really did.  But it wasn't bad at all.  What was the opening part?  It was kind of a weird...  It was one of the Simpsons.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I know.  Hens love roosters, geese love ganders, everyone else loves...  Club Soda Kenny.  See, I like that.  I just didn't understand what the first part was saying.  I couldn't understand the lyrics to the first part.  It's catchy.  What are the lyrics in the first part? 
[00:29:00]  It goes, hens love roosters, geese love ganders, everyone else loves Ned Flanders, but we  just swapped it out.  Oh, okay.  He's keeping the whole bird motif going with himself.  Thumbs up or thumbs down?  Down.  I don't know.  I'm not going to totally thumbs down it because it's not bad.  I just couldn't understand the lyrics.  I really don't know much about the Simpsons.  I got to give it a plus just because it's a Simpsons reference.  That's kind of cool.  Hey, what's his name?  Club Soda Kenny in it.  A cartoon character?  No, I don't think you were saying that. 
[00:29:30]  I think I like chemistries.  Yeah.  Oh, Eric, you bummed?  No, I just got a hot deal.  Yeah, no.  Oh, Eric.  No, thanks, Eric.  Just busy, guys.  Thanks.  I'm just busy.  I'm busy.  I didn't say it was good.  It's like when you give your mom a gift for Christmas.  You probably don't like it.  I saved the receipt.  You don't have to use it.  He's kind of bummed, isn't he?  Of course he is.  Right now he's doing it.  He's walking.  If you look behind, from behind, you can see his arms doing this.  No, it's nothing.  That's your wiping motion.  Let's go to Toronto.  Rick, what's up, buddy? 
[00:30:00]  Oi!  Hey.  If I got my vote, chemistry gets it.  You like chemistries?  Yeah, bud.  All right, good.  I think we're going to go with chemistries for a while until something better comes along.  But I think chemistries is really good.  Hey, Lady Di, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  What are you doing?  How are you doing, guys?  Why are you calling so early?  I don't know.  I just felt like calling you guys.  Are you up?  You're having an eggnog contest today?  Yes, we're doing that.  Do you want to come down and say hi? 
[00:30:30]  If I can.  I really want to do it, but I can't do it.  Everybody here.  Let's get into it.  Get stupid.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Everybody.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get punched right in the face.  Hey, let's get retarded in here.  Let's get a bruise on your jaw.  Let's lie and say it was a treadmill. 
[00:31:00]  Let's wreck our livers in here.  So what's going on with you guys today?  Eggnog contest or what?  Let's get cirrhosis in here.  Eggnog contest today.  Yes, we said that already.  I know you did.  Now, are you hungry?  Of course she is.  Yeah, sure.  Are you up early because you're going to go find a job today or you're still drinking?  Well, yes and no.  Yeah, later on.  I'm going to see if I can go out there and get something going on.  You couldn't even stammer out a better lie than that. 
[00:31:30]  That was horrible.  Jim, stop it.  I'm going to see if I can later maybe possibly go up there and see if I can find a...  Have you been drinking all night again?  No, I have not.  Then why are you up at this hour?  Because I got up.  I just got up and I heard your show.  You don't have XM.  You don't have XM.  Marion called me up.  No, Marion called me up and she said, call him up and that's it.  She is such a lying sack.  You aren't listening to the show.  And Marion didn't call you?  Marion has the XM satellite radio.  And what?  She puts the receiver to the radio and you listen? 
[00:32:00]  Yes.  Sometimes she does that.  Yes.  No, she doesn't.  You're such a liar.  You said I got up and I heard the show.  No, she's not a liar.  You were implying that it was...  I'll be a liar.  Hold on, hold on.  You said you got up and heard the show.  That's a lie.  Yes, Nixon.  You lied again.  Because she calls me up and she says, Diana, listen to the show.  How is that hearing the show?  That's a joke every once in a while.  If she told you to get a job, that didn't seem to make you get a job.  So just because she says something doesn't make it sound.  And she said, get up and listen to the show, but you don't have XM satellite radio. 
[00:32:30]  So how are you listening?  Because she puts the radio up to the telephone and I could hear the show.  What a liar.  And she did that this morning?  What do you mean?  Who said that?  Opie?  Yes.  Opie.  Listen to me.  That's what she does.  Liar.  And she did it this morning?  No.  And she did that this morning?  Yeah, she just did it a little while ago.  You're lying.  And what do you hear?  You want to call the show?  All right.  You know what?  I believe Lady Di.  Oh.  Lady Di, you know, don't prove me wrong here.  Prove me right. 
[00:33:00]  What did you hear when you were listening on the phone when Marion...  I heard about the eggnog contest and I heard Clep Soda Kenny is there today.  How you doing, Clep Soda?  No, you heard that while you were on hold.  How do we start the show today?  Oh, well, that part I really don't know.  No, but she called me up and she put me, you know, so this way I could hear the show.  For five seconds, probably.  No, not for five seconds.  You're lying.  All right.  Well, um, hmm. 
[00:33:30]  Okay.  I'm not lying to you.  Why would I lie about something like that?  Are you stupid?  Why don't you come down?  Might make the guys puke faster.  Yeah, you want to come down?  I don't know.  I'm thinking about it right now.  All right.  I'm thinking about it.  We're over here in Jersey, so it's like, you know, I don't know.  Where are you going to find a job today?  Well, I'm going to go back to the old places that I looked at before.  No, you're not.  Places that she can't name. 
[00:34:00]  She's going to go pound the pavement, but she does that every time she walks anyway.  Well, I have to pound the pavement right now because my Jeep Cherokee is not working.  Anybody want to buy it?  It's not working right now.  It's a 91 Jeep Cherokee.  You're going to maybe put an application into a walk and roll, are you?  Lady Di, anything else you want to say today?  No, not really.  No.  All right, get out of here.  But good luck with your contest.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Bye, babe.  We love you. 
[00:34:30]  There she goes.  Lady Di.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye.  Of course you will.  Let's lie like a rug in here.  Let's get retarded in here.  Shut up.  I'll talk to you later.  Wait, die, die, die.  What?  Ben, so what's going on out there?  We getting all set?  Yeah, we're getting ready.  All right.  The contestants look quite scary.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  It really looks like a night in the tombs.  Up for grabs today is a MiFi, the portable satellite radio from XM Satellite.  Guys, we'll see you soon.  And do you hear anything, Anthony?  I thought I was hung up on her.  It was like a bug in my ear.  And we'll see you soon, guys.  And we got a, we should have some kind of side bet today.  Maybe give out another, do we have another MiFi to give out or is this the last one?  Oh, sure.  Why not?  Can I have a MiFi?  All right.  So, well, you know what we should do, Anthony? 
[00:35:30]  We need to have some kind of side thing going for listeners all over the country where they  could win a MiFi today.  That's good.  Where we involve the rest of the nation that can't quite be here.  Maybe we get like five guys on the phone to, I don't know, somehow bet how long the last  guy's going to last or something.  That's a good one.  Don't forget about me.  How do you want to do this?  With a gun.  We'll get five listeners.  Right. 
[00:36:00]  And they will have to pick a time.  Is that it?  Or maybe we should pick a time out of the hat.  How about pick how many, you know, cups of eggnog the last guy's going to do?  Oh, closest wins.  Right.  Price is right type thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, but none of that over crap.  None of the sexual harassment officers either.  And what if there's a tie?  How could there be a tie if they all have different numbers?  Hey, guys, could I ask you a question?  Remember, harass is one word. 
[00:36:30]  Let's say like, let's say the guy does 20 cups and one guy says it's 19 and one guy  says 21.  That would be a tie.  That would be a tie indeed.  Then the overrule is in play.  Then the guy who's under wins.  The guy that's under?  Right.  Okay.  Can I ask you a question?  So it's not a bad idea to do like that.  No.  You like that idea?  Yeah.  And if we have an extra one to give away, what are we going to do with it?  Well, because...  What about Marion and I?  Because it's not really fair because, you know, the people that come down to the contest 
[00:37:00]  are all from this area, more or less.  Did the guy come from Arizona?  I don't think so.  Oh, yeah.  What about the distance guy?  And what about the guy from Maine?  That guy's a dick.  Oh, really?  Why, Ben?  Ah, he was just being a dick.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  We should take a break and regroup here.  What happened to Lady Di?  I'm going to go get your egg whites now.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  Why don't you give a my-fi to one of the, like a regular on the show or something, no?  Well, yeah.  What about us?  We have plenty of them, so we'll just, you know, we'll give them out to anybody. 
[00:37:30]  We literally have a whole box filled with them.  Yeah.  We should take care of some of the regulars that help the radio show on a daily basis.  I was thinking of just going out on the street, too, and just, hey, you know, Merry Christmas,  kind of just anybody walking down the street.  That is a beautiful gesture.  Well, don't forget about Lady Di and Marion.  But what about, like, you know, some of the people that call the show a lot and contribute,  but we don't really, you know, give them money or anything?  This would be a nice little Christmas present.  Oh, boy.  Yes, those people should be recognized.  You're absolutely right.  Maybe, like, Marion, you know, someone like that. 
[00:38:00]  No, not me.  Marion contributes a lot to the show.  Marion is-  What about that?  What about my guys?  She does do good radio.  Marion is unbelievable, you know.  She's annoying, but she does great stuff for us.  Radio.  People like to be annoyed by what Marion has to say.  I think anybody who's given us good radio should get one.  Marion's got a nice husband.  Yeah, Marion has her act together.  She's got a job, and she calls when she can, you know.  She comes to the shows.  She comes to the shows, sits in the front row, dedicated, very dedicated to the Opie and Anthony cause.  Absolutely. 
[00:38:30]  She has pretty good comebacks.  I'm dedicated, too.  I can't think of anyone else besides Marion that would be worthy of a my-fi.  This guy, maybe, well, Kenny's not even-  Well, we kind of pay Kenny here and there, so we're looking for that person that does a lot,  but just doesn't get money or recognition.  It's our little way of saying thank you for what you have done.  Patty, maybe.  Yeah, Starker Patty's another really good one.  Patty would be good.  What about me?  So Starker Patty is good.  What about me? 
[00:39:00]  Marion's really good.  Is there anyone else?  Maybe we could put these people's names in a hat and pull a name out and give them a little early Christmas gift, Tiffany.  Well, if Dumb Frenchie had called in again, he would have been on the list.  But Frenchie's given us some good stuff.  Absolutely.  Frenchie's good.  Marion's good.  Starker Patty's good.  Is there anyone else that we want to throw in a hat?  Frenchie hasn't called in in over a month, but I still think that Frenchie should be on the list.  Yeah.  Big Kev.  Of course.  Big Kev's a good one.  We should get one for him.  You lump me in there.  So.  What about me? 
[00:39:30]  It isn't fair.  I think that pretty much covers everybody.  Kev.  Marion.  No, no, no.  What about me?  Oh, right, right, right.  Frenchie.  Uh-huh.  And what club's what does he count because he gets paid?  There's someone else I'm thinking about, but I can't remember her name.  Patty.  You put an L, and it begins with a D.  Patty.  Capital L, capital D.  Let's see.  Who else could it be?  Yeah.  Anthony, anyone else?  No one I can think of at all.  That's what we got those for.  What about Earl?  You can get a minority in there. 
[00:40:00]  That's true.  We should give one to another radio guy.  Yeah.  You see?  Another radio guy.  All right.  Well, we'll figure that part of this out as well.  Sure.  I'm sure you will.  We should take a break, Anthony.  Yep.  I'm going to have a pastry, Ope.  You're going to have a pastry?  Yeah.  What kind of food have these guys brought in today?  Ben.  A lot of Dunkin' Donuts.  A lot of donuts.  Yeah.  A lot of bad food. 
[00:40:30]  Let me get you your breakfast, please.  Kenny doesn't like when we eat things that the listeners bring.  All right, Kenny, go get us breakfast.  Make sure I have potatoes with my eggs, please.  Yes, of course.  And as we go to break, we should play Get Your Cock Out.  For the new listeners that are not going to get it, it's a whole Monster Rain thing that  happened, and Monster Rain songs, and chemistry came up with this just beauty.  You have to do your research on the program.  Yeah.  Go to, like, foundrymusic.com and get the whole history.  Or opieandanthony.com, okay?  And I wish Lady Di would call back. 
[00:41:00]  I'm on the show right now.  She doesn't care less about the show.  She hangs up.  She just says what she wants to say.  She hangs up.  It's obvious that she doesn't want to really be part of the show.  And if she was, we could probably help her out in a lot of aspects of her life.  What a dummy.  We're giving away a mind-fi.  She doesn't even want a mind-fi.  That's how little she cares about the show.  Yeah, I want Marion to call and just, like, put me on the phone so I can listen to the  show.  It's stupid.  That's not a right thing.  I don't dig that at all.  No, not at all.  Why don't we play Chemistry's Get Your Cock Out?  And we'll continue with the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  On the way, the Eggnog Drinking Contest. 
[00:41:30]  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says, get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth. 
[00:42:00]  Pull, pull.  Put your face south while we're under the house.  Jimmy, crawl under the porch.  Pull, pull.  Yeah, I said it.  Crawl under the porch.  The monster rain's coming.  The sky's gray.  My pants down.  Two kids helping each other under the damn house.  Y'all know the game.  Monster fucking rain.  It ain't a damn thing changed.  You're all under the porch.  Your friends fellate you.  Crawl under.  As two digits masturbate you.  I alleviate the stress with a cock caress.  I explode on my friend's neck with a monster mess.  Just two little toys. 
[00:42:30]  No need for vagalube.  Stuck on a little crotch with a slight lack of pubes.  We gotta keep it quiet.  Make sure mom don't find out.  I'll finish you off quick so I can pull mine out.  It's just a little pleasure with a lot of shame.  Who cares?  I gotta blame it all on the monster rain.  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says, get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth.  Put your face south while we're under the house.  Jimmy, crawl under the porch.  Yeah, I said it.  Crawl under the porch. 
[00:43:00]  The monster rain's coming.  The sky's gray.  My pants down.  Two kids helping each other under the damn house.  Jimmy Norton, get your cock out.  Jimmy Robinson, get your cock out.  Willie D'Angelo, get your cock out.  Everybody, get your cock out.  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad jokes. 
[00:43:30]  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  Because we're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love doing this radio show.  Right?  Okay, terrific.  Time to put your mouth or our balls on.  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool.  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment mostly.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  Don't listen, you twat.  Get her over the head with a shovel.  If you did that, I would make love to you right now.  Come on.  People that get their news from O&A are the same people who watched Sesame Street until  they were 12.  Yes, precisely. 
[00:44:00]  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats, because here comes a home run.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You and Anthony.

It's an Opie and Anthony Wow Sticker stop.  This Wednesday, between 6 and 7 a.m., during your morning commute,  get to Grand Central Station in New York City and pick up your Wow Stickers.  Whoa, those aren't real.  Yes, they are.  The entrance on 42nd Street near the subway and taxi stand.  I'm getting an erection as we speak. 
[00:47:00]  Once again, here is how a troop sound.  The Wow Sticker Stop, brought to you by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snow Report.  I'm Chuck Devine.  It's presented by Steamboat Colorado.  Come see why folks have coined Steamboat, the land of the free, home of the brave,  and playground of the red-blooded powder hounds.  Visit steamboat.com, where world-renowned athletes will be taking on the moguls and freestyle this weekend.  It's an event that will be televised on CBS for the day after Christmas. 
[00:47:30]  It's called Ultimate Bumps and Jumps, all happening at Steamboat.  And they also picked up brand-new snow at Vail in Colorado, 14 inches over the past week.  Park City and Utah has all seven bowls open.  In Vermont, fresh powder at Smuggler's Notch.  Here's Andy Davis.  That's a pretty good timing.  Smuggler's opens up Madonna for the first time this season,  and I was one of the first ten people to the top.  Fresh groomed corduroy on Chilcut.  Then the ski patrols started to drop the ropes.  FIS and free fall.  Two steep runs with knee-deep powder.  It was a day of powder shots and ear-to-ear grins. 
[00:48:00]  In the heart of winter, this is Andy at Smuggs.  And I'm Chuck Devine with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  It's M202, the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's very busy at the show today. 
[00:48:30]  It's the O.N.A. Virus eggnog drinking contest going down today on the O.P. and Anthony program.  Contestants are pretty much ready.  This one guy.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  He's hot under the collar.  And you, the guy from Maine, I'm a dick, in capital letters.  F-U, Ben.  He told me he couldn't hold a spot.  Ben is a fucking dick.  Wow.  Then Steve emails this AM saying they emailed me the paperwork.  Well, I didn't get it.  Fuck you, Ben, you crazy-haired dick. 
[00:49:00]  I wanted their bed.  Fucking Ben, asshole.  This guy don't like you, Ben.  I don't like him either.  Neither does Steve.  Two against one.  I see it's funny that he called you a crazy-haired dick.  Crazy-haired dick.  This guy sent me and Steve over the last couple days probably 50 emails.  Yeah, but the guy is a dedicated O.P. and Anthony fan.  He wanted to drive down from Maine to be in the eggnog drinking contest, and for some  reason we couldn't hold a spot for the guy.  I don't know why.  I'm just saying.  No, he was trying.  And then he went back and forth with Ben, you know, trying to get it done, and Ben kind 
[00:49:30]  of blew him off like, whatever, dude.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  How did it go now?  Steve and I, and he tried to play us against each other.  He'd say one thing to Steve and then a different thing to me.  All right, where's Steve?  I think you were gossiping, and it probably got away from me.  You were thinking about it.  Perhaps.  Speaking of gossiping, crazy, crazy-haired dick.  All the, all right, listen to that.  After the show, Ben was doing exactly what Jim brings on.  We were in the back just chit-chatting.  After the show yesterday.  Yeah, he was talking about BCN in Boston. 
[00:50:00]  He's like, you know, my friend will be there, and Anthony Clark would come in, and Mark  is grabbing his ass and putting his neck on his ass, going, hey, how you doing?  Hey, Mark Brant.  That is true.  A little more gossip.  Oh, man, Ben started gossiping, and Jim and I just immediately stared at each other.  Oh, we made eye contact real quick.  We made the eye contact, like, remember this for tomorrow, and I'm writing notes down  in my head.  Anthony Clark was on TV.  I was just like, oh, I remember the days he used to come in and pull his pants down for  Parenteau.  I can't say, Ben is probably like the inquirer where everybody laughs at him and says, ah, 
[00:50:30]  but he's probably accurate.  But it's all true.  Yeah, yeah.  Like 80% of the time, he's right.  Ben is the voice of Boston.  He just knows the eyes and ears of Beantown.  He absolutely, I believe everything he says about the stuff up there.  There's always funny Parenteau stories.  But that's what made me think of it, because he was on TV yesterday.  All right.  Steve, what's going on with the main guy?  Because now the main guy pretty much wants to kill Ben.  No, the reality is the guy was contacting me for about two weeks prior to this contest,  and I was all set to say, do it. 
[00:51:00]  I wasn't doing anything.  I just thought.  Oh, you didn't.  Okay, sorry.  I saw your finger on this.  I was adjusting something over here on my console.  I don't really know what he's doing.  Steve, will you just talk?  All right, fine.  Relax.  It's a radio show.  Of course.  Go ahead.  Kid was emailing for two weeks, and he wanted in on the contest.  Why are you laughing?  What's wrong with you?  Because it wasn't Anthony's hand darted over.  No, there's nothing going on there.  You are just overly paranoid about the music kicking in while you talk.  Derailed.  Nervous Nelly. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Sorry.  All right.  The kid was emailing for two weeks.  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  Are you all right?  Don't be such a hothead.  Oh, my God.  You got so into his head.  I love it.  I know what's going on.  We said we would give one spot in the contest to the person that came the furthest,  and this guy thought, being from Maine, that he would be the guy.  But there's a guy out there.  We should bring him in real fast as we're talking to Steve.  He came from Arizona to be in the eggnog drinking contest pretty far. 
[00:52:00]  And the reality was I was going to hold a spot for this kid,  and I was in the room when Master Poe sent him.  Damn it.  You really got to put your headphones on, bro.  There's no headphones left.  And Master Poe is what?  All right.  So, anyway, the kid got really pissed off, even though we sent him all the paperwork.  I don't know what his problem is.  Eh, whatever. 
[00:52:30]  Fuck him.  Wow.  Well, you know what, dude?  I've gotten 30 emails in the last week from this kid, you know, every five minutes.  Okay, so am I in?  Am I in?  I'm like, dude.  He's just a very motivated, you know, O.K.  That's fine.  But you know what?  He's hardcore.  Everything we possibly could do to get him his paperwork ahead of time and said,  here, be here.  Even if your paperwork isn't done, I know you're coming from Maine.  You'll get in.  Yeah.  And now he sent really nasty emails to Ben and I both this morning saying he feels gypped.  I don't know what to tell him.  Well, maybe that guy could call in and address what's going on here so we can get to the 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, I'd like to talk to the guy on the show.  I would, too.  On the air.  He really doesn't like that.  Get his side of the story.  Of course.  Good point, Ant.  Yeah.  This guy came from Arizona for the eggnog drinking contest.  Wow.  Hi, Doug.  How you doing?  Good.  Arizona?  Yep.  Flew, jet blew yesterday night, 11 o'clock.  Came in about 7 in the morning.  Wow.  Flying back out tomorrow.  Taking my last final.  Then coming back.  For what?  For what?  Oh, my parents live out on the island.  So I'm going to go Christmas and then go back to Arizona.  What part of Arizona?  Tempe.  So you really just flew in for this? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Got all my gas receipts, boarding passes.  What a good sport this guy is.  Believe the guy.  Wait, you got the latest feedback from the guy from Maine?  Yeah.  What's it say?  Wait, let Jimmy read it.  Let's see.  Oh, sorry.  Because you read the last one pretty well.  Oh, from Maine.  Oh, Jesus.  He really is hot into the collar.  He said the same one twice.  This is capital letters.  Fuck him, crazy-haired dick.  That means capital letters, by the way. 
[00:54:00]  I sent Ben three emails and Steve 12 over the last two weeks, exclamation point.  I have copies.  That fucking crazy-haired dick is full of shitter.  S-H-I-T-R.  You're full of shitter.  50 emails.  What the fuck is that?  Fucking crazy-haired dick.  17 total.  Not 50, Ben.  You fuck.  Wow.  17 is a lot, too, though.  17 is a lot.  That is a disagreement. 
[00:54:30]  There's a little disagreement going on.  You're in a little delay out there.  I thought Norton was yelling at someone in the hall.  That's what I thought.  Kenny, you turned the lights off.  I like that.  You're really big and stupid.  I didn't even notice.  All right.  So, Doug came from Arizona just for the eggnog drinking contest.  I don't think you're going to be one of the favorites, though, man.  You're smaller than a lot of the other contestants.  It's not the size that matters.  I don't know.  I think it's all about the size of your stomach, and I'm thinking if you're a bigger guy,  you've got a bigger stomach.  Simple as that.  I don't know. 
[00:55:00]  A lot of those guys are also a lot older than me.  I don't know if their stomachs can handle it.  Ah, a little youth thing in play here.  I like the trash talking that's starting.  Yeah?  Yeah?  You in college?  Yeah.  See, the college guys are doing nothing but getting fucked up every week, so.  True.  Possible good, strong stomach.  Yeah.  But strong back, Joe Buck.  I can handle a body of a Jaeger or two without puking, so I figure it out.  So how many of these cups do you think you could do?  Show them where the line is, because it's deceiving.  We're only filling up these cups up to the mark.  How many do you think you could do?  That's pretty much like a double shot of eggnog every minute. 
[00:55:30]  Probably about 30, because you figure nobody can do, you ever do the gallon challenge where  you drink a gallon of milk in an hour?  Yeah, we're going to do that one next.  Yeah, nobody can handle that, and that's half the time with the thicker.  So I'd say probably about 20 to 30, and I think everyone will be done.  So if I can hold out for 25 maybe, I'll walk away with a nice $300 profit, although I have  to pay for the airline tickets.  That's true.  If I walk away with the MiFi, fantastic.  You guys should bet each other out there, so you come away with something.  They're a little too chummy out there. 
[00:56:00]  They all know each other.  I'm the outsider here.  Are you the outsider?  I'm the quiet outsider, just keeping my head down, perseverance.  Coming in.  Coming in from the outside.  I have to win, though.  Swoop in, take their prize that they feel they are entitled to away.  Yep.  He's the Ricky Linderman of the contest.  Thank you, Kenny.  You're among friends, Ricky.  You're among friends, Ricky.  All right, Doug.  Slashed open a little wrist with a brother with a little bullet hole in his head.  We'll see you in a little bit, okay?  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Looking through the junk pile for that stupid carburetor. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, and then he finds it, and then Moody smacks him around, and Mike, who kind of looks  like Pat before he blew up in a food-induced depression.  Remember Mike?  Hey, is that your bike, tough guy?  And he smacks Linderman around and breaks his bike and gives it to Moody.  I love that.  And I hated...  My bike.  It's my bike.  And I hated Moody...  What was Chris Makepeace?  What was his real name?  What was his name in that?  Clifford Peach.  Wow, you're good.  And his friend with the bad sinuses.  Clifford...  Look at his friend. 
[00:57:00]  He's that.  He's awful.  Linderman scares me.  Linderman should have raped all of them in the mouth in the bathroom.  You're among friends, Ricky.  Grams with your old bag.  Exactly.  You Harry and Mort cock, please.  Anthony, before we do the eggnog drinking contest, we've got a couple things we've definitely  got to get to.  Yeah.  So you think this is funny, the Frankie Blue thing? 
[00:57:30]  I do.  I love it.  Anytime you can...  It's very voyeuristic.  Even though it's going out to a bunch of people on the radio, I think this is very voyeuristic.  It's an uncomfortable situation.  It's somebody put in a position they shouldn't have been in.  Well, I guess what happened...  Our old radio station, WNEW.  Yeah.  There's a curse with our old station ever since we left.  Absolutely.  Ever since we left, it's just been in the toilet.  They can't figure out what to do with the station.  And it's just failing miserably. 
[00:58:00]  Ratings are always in the toilet.  They have tried...  How many different formats?  They've tried three or four since we left.  Yep.  And the one that did the best was the three months that they played Christmas music last  year.  Right.  They started like at Halloween and played it through New Year.  And it did better than any format they put on there.  Well, our old company, they hired this dope John Sykes, who was supposed to help the radio  division.  And the radio division's been a disaster ever since he took the helm.  And now they're just kind of paying him, and he's in a little office, and no one bothers 
[00:58:30]  him because he's under contract.  They're going to fire him real soon.  But he had no business trying to run the radio division of Viacom.  Got to bump Joel Hollander up into that position.  He's the genius.  Joel Hollander's an amazing radio guy, and he will right the ship.  But this guy, John Sykes, which is just a waste of space.  An asshole.  A two-faced fuck.  You know, he told Anthony and I when we did the Sex with Sam thing that...  Crazy-haired dick.  ...that we were going to be okay. 
[00:59:00]  He said we were going to be okay.  And then all of a sudden, he just blew us off, never talked to us again, and then just  hid behind lawyers and his secretary and stuff.  Never could get him on the phone again.  And we find out how he didn't like the show.  Didn't like what we were doing.  That's the type of executive you want running your radio division.  A guy that doesn't have balls and will tell you to your face what's going on, you know?  Oh, didn't he think it was bad for kids, the show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, he thought he knew what he was doing, and we get fired.  And the station has been a complete disaster ever since. 
[00:59:30]  And the radio division, quite frankly, has been a complete disaster ever since.  They lost millions upon millions of dollars, and in the end, it was John Sykes' fault.  Simple as that.  Joel Hollander wasn't running the radio division back then.  He just wasn't.  And anyway, it's unheard of in radio history to have a station that has been floundering  for as long as NEW.  It just doesn't happen.  When that happens at a station, they fix it.  They fix the problem.  Right.  Especially in New York.  Right, it's the number one mark in the country.  Right.  You can't have a radio property just sitting there with one rating. 
[01:00:00]  And a history like NEW has.  Yeah.  It's in last place.  There are radio stations that don't even have a signal, a strong signal in Manhattan  that are beating our old station.  Easy listening music stations from Long Island beat it out.  Right.  It's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  We've got to rewind a second, though, because the guy from Maine is on the phone, and then  we'll continue with this story.  Jared, what's up, buddy?  Jesus Christ.  Man, what the fuck?  Hold on, Jared. 
[01:00:30]  We're going to try to get you set up here.  Let's get Steve in here, too.  Yeah, get Steve.  And Ben, why don't you grab the microphone, wherever it is?  It's hidden in his hair.  There it is.  This is Jared from Maine.  Ben, who's a hardcore Opie and Anthony fan.  He really wanted to drive from Maine just to be in the eggnog drinking contest, and he  had some kind of problem with not only Ben, but also Steve.  I didn't have a problem with Steve.  Oh, you don't have a problem with Steve?  Not at all.  All right.  He doesn't have a problem with you, Steve, so you can just hang out there.  Ben could fight his own battle.  I like his divide-and-conquer attitude.  He immediately split up Steve and Ben. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Go ahead, Ben.  He's been doing this the whole time.  All right.  So what's up, Jared?  Tell us what happened.  Well, fucking, I started emailing Steve two weeks ago before they even posted on the  web that if you live from far away, contact us, ASAP, we'll try and hold a spot for you.  Uh-huh.  So Steve was doing whatever he could for me.  Steve was great.  Yep.  Okay.  Ben says, I sent 50 emails.  Fuck him.  I didn't send 50 emails, you crazy-haired fuck. 
[01:01:30]  Cool.  I sent fucking 17 to Steve and three to you.  That's a lot of emails, huh?  Over two weeks.  But you wanted in the contest, so I understand.  All right.  Did you get answers?  Did you get answers to any of these emails?  Oh, Steve answered me every time.  Steve was great.  So, now, wait a minute.  I'm wondering why, if Steve answered you, would you keep sending so many emails?  Because I just wanted to know, you know, do I have a spot?  A lot of people are contacting you guys to do this.  And what was the answer that you got back? 
[01:02:00]  So, he just kept telling me to let me know.  Is this true, Steve?  No, I said, it's a remix.  No, in all fairness, we hadn't really worked out the logistics of how we were going to  get these people up and who we were going to pick.  So, I said, look, dude, you're coming from pretty far away, so let me know.  Just, you know, keep yourself on the radar as the contest day draws closer.  And we did, in all fairness, send out all the paperwork to Jared. 
[01:02:30]  The other day, Poe and I, and we even sent a separate email saying, look, since you're  coming from so far away, I guarantee you're going to get up here.  And I did, and I watched him, and I was in the room when Poe sent the email up.  Why he didn't get it, I don't know.  No, I didn't get it.  I believe you said it, but I didn't get it.  So, are you okay with Ben now, or no?  No, I'm not.  Ooh.  Because Ben fucking sends me an email saying, we can't hold a spot.  Ooh.  No, he just, exactly.  I said we couldn't guarantee you hold a spot because there was a guy coming from Arizona.  And Steve sent me an email right after that saying what he just said. 
[01:03:00]  But then I sent, I mean, I replied to that saying, thanks anyway, Steve, but Ben already  told me he can't hold me a spot.  Ooh.  Ah, well, all right.  Whatever.  It doesn't, you know, like.  There were so many emails, it was hard to keep tracking.  Yeah, honestly, I'm not going to, I'm, you know, look, I can't, I'm not going to.  Well, 17 is a lot.  None of these other guys said 17.  Oh, 17, 50, there's a fucking difference there.  Well, sorry, I exaggerated a little bit, but however, I mean, that's, I don't get 17 emails  from anyone.  Look, dude, the reality is Ben and I get a lot, dude, shut up, shut up, listen. 
[01:03:30]  I'm copied on all those, idiot.  If you look, me and Steve are on all of them.  That's why I keep going through, it's just ridiculous.  Ben and I CC each other on every email we get, so we try to, you know, communicate as  best as seemingly possible.  When there's hundreds of emails being sent back and forth every day, sometimes you miss  one.  You know, but dude, I kept in contact with you as best as I possibly could, and I filled  Ben in as best as I possibly could to everything.  But Jared is saying that Ben exaggerated.  You're saying that Ben.  That's what I'm saying, Ben exaggerated.  All right, so he lied, basically.  I didn't lie. 
[01:04:00]  No, no, I don't say that.  All right, so Jared, what do you want to say to Ben?  Fuck you, Ben.  Okay, thank you.  Jared, you thought you had like a spot possibly, and you were trying hard to get down here,  and you felt that Ben was not being conducive with getting you down here.  Right.  I got one email from Ben.  He can't hold you a spot.  And you're a hardcore fan.  You've been listening to us for a while, right?  I've been listening to you since day one.  There you go.  Day one of what?  The new show?  The old show?  The new show.  I never heard the old show.  Oh, wow, and you're already a hardcore fan.  That's pretty cool.  All right, I think we have to figure out something here. 
[01:04:30]  Maybe he could be in on the side bet thing.  That's a good idea.  Or my fi.  We got your phone numbers.  Ben, would that be okay if he's a part of the...  Oh, Ben doesn't want you in the contest.  Ben does not want you in this contest.  Yeah, Jared, he's shaking his head like no fucking way.  And then on the air, he says, yeah, fine.  It's amazing.  He has a problem with you.  Huh?  Who's the boss?  Ben, kind of.  He's the executive producer.  If Ben doesn't want you in the contest, I don't know what to tell you.  He trumps all of us when it comes down to the contest.  Ben, do you want him in the contest? 
[01:05:00]  Look at Ben.  Look at Ben.  What?  He doesn't want you in the contest, Jared.  It's very obvious.  I don't care.  No, I don't care.  He's shaking his head and giving the finger and stuff, and then finally gets on Mike again.  I'm so glad I'm not in this firing squad right now.  I'm a firing squad.  Well, you are on your shirt.  I don't care if you want him in the contest.  Sure, call.  Yeah, Jared, he's making the throat cut for no.  It's amazing what he's doing.  He doesn't want to look like the bad guy on the air, but he's wielding his shaky iron fist.  You do that thing with your index finger across your neck. 
[01:05:30]  He's doing that to you.  Somebody need to be thrown out?  No, no.  No, Kenny, everything's okay.  All right.  No, I was eating my breakfast, and I heard like a commotion.  A commotion.  No, everything's all right.  You can go eat your egg sandwich.  No, I'm done.  Thanks.  All right.  You've got to get your energy up, because there's a lot of freaks out here that you've got to take care of.  I see.  All right.  Any problems out there?  No.  That's why I was checking in, because, you know, if Ben says jump, I say, how high?  Oh, that's funny. 
[01:06:00]  If Ben says shit, I say, what color?  Right.  All right, Kenny.  I think we've got everything under control, all right?  Yeah.  All right.  And remember, my big announcement is coming up, folks.  That's after the eggnog drinking contest?  Yeah.  Well, once we get the party started.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  There he goes.  Stand down, Kenny.  Here comes Club Soda Candy.  He's big and stupid.  Six foot five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big. 
[01:06:30]  Hope you're ready, because here comes Club Soda Candy.  Thank you.  All right.  Jared.  Yes, sir.  You want him in, Ben?  Sure.  He can be in.  Oh.  I don't really care.  All right.  Jared.  It's not that big a deal to me.  All right.  We got your info, right?  I don't know.  I think you've got my number there.  In one of your 50 emails, did you send a contact number?  I think so.  Yeah, we've got to take care of the hardcore fans, man.  Of course.  You'll be in the side bet, okay?  Sweet.  Jared from Maine will be in on that. 
[01:07:00]  Bye, Jared.  All right.  Getting back to the Frankie Blue thing.  What happened?  They're just showing a giant shark on TV in Australia.  I guess it's one of the two that ripped a surfer in half.  I don't know why you would surf in Australia at this point.  That's where all the shark attacks are.  Some in Hawaii, but mostly in Australia.  I read that story yesterday.  It was just, oh, frightening.  This guy is on the back of a, he's on a surfboard being towed by a boat with his two buddies in the boat watching.  He falls off the surfboard, and his buddies watch as one shark, huge, you know, these Australian great whites, 
[01:07:30]  rips him in half, completely in half in one bite, ripped him in half.  And then as the other half of his body is, like, floating away, another shark comes up, grabs that half.  Holy heck.  And just, goodbye, goodbye, you're eaten, and you're gone, and the family has no recollection or any evidence you ever existed.  You're just shark crap.  His little raft is going to wash up all yellow with tooth prints in it. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  My mother's going to smack the police commissioner in the face for not closing the beaches.  I don't even like to drink water because fish fucking it.  Now, did he fall off the raft, or did he get pulled off by a shark?  They said he fell off.  You know?  That's...  Why would you surf in Australia?  It's like going... 
[01:08:30]  There's monsters in the water.  They're real, live monsters.  I'd rather go to an ATM in Harlem.  Dennis?  Yeah.  So they're looking for the shark now, I guess.  Are you going to question him?  He's a fucking shark.  Get out of his house.  Well, perhaps they could, you know, cut open his belly.  Take out the license plate and everything else.  It's not the time nor place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.  And I, for one, am not going to stand by while you cut that thing open and watch that little 
[01:09:00]  titner boy spill out all over the dock.  And then fast forward to the movie when he's got to sign the thing to close the beach.  I was here.  My son was in the water, too.  Chief, I...  I...  Just sign the...  I...  All of a sudden, he turned into Dr. Bellows.  But Jeannie would...  And then I saw...  Oh, jeez, I need a doctor.  But...  Major Nelson, and then...  But then I saw... 
[01:09:30]  She was...  And then...  Can someone explain it to Club Soda Kenny?  That's from my...  Dream of Jeannie.  My dream of Jeannie, Kenny.  You ever watch that show?  You were looking really stupid during that.  No, I was just in awe...  Oh!  ...of the talent that was exuding...  Ah!  ...from his mouth, because I'm enamored with his impressions.  The talent of watching much too much television.  No, I dream of Jeannie.  Who didn't jerk off to that show?  Jesus.  All right.  Why don't you prepare your big statement for after the eggnog drinking contest, okay? 
[01:10:00]  I got it right off the top of my head.  All right.  You might want to write it down, though.  You're kind of...  You're kind of, you know, stupid.  Yes, that's no secret, but I got this covered.  All right.  There he goes.  Club Soda Kenny.  So, getting back to the Frankie Blue thing in our old radio station that has just been  in the twilight ever since we left.  Falling apart.  Because they really thought they knew what they were doing by firing us and moving on.  Oh, yeah.  They figured they would compete with other stations that are doing very well around New  York, because, boy, there's a win situation. 
[01:10:30]  Go head-to-head against stations that are just entrenched in the market, have great ratings  doing what they're doing, because people will just change their habits like that for the  same thing they could get in the place that they've been for years and years and years.  Now, RuPaul is, what, their morning person now, weren't there?  Was RuPaul...  Person.  That's good.  Oh, whatever.  Yeah.  Morning guy.  Yeah.  It's a guy, people.  Morning parental disappointment.  When I...  It's RuPaul the drag queen does mornings over there.  Okay.  When I sit there, and you have to listen to some people go, RuPaul, she is so pretty. 
[01:11:00]  It's got a cock.  It's a guy.  Boy, you're a buzzkill.  Fine.  So then, big, smooth back.  So then the old company gets the bright idea to hire this Frankie Blue guy, because he  was really good at KTU, I guess?  What was KTU?  Kind of like a dance mix station?  Yeah, kind of like commercial dance music.  Like dance music.  So they're like, well, we'll hire the guy that made KTU great, and we'll put him on 
[01:11:30]  NEW, and he'll have the same success over here.  Right.  Well, so far, he hasn't done anything, except get drunk at Christmas gatherings.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And Earl was there, too.  Yeah, our old pal Earl was here.  Earl.  Was there, I should say.  And Earl did not give us his tape.  I want to go on the record and tell you, he did not have anything to do with the tape  we're about to play.  Right.  He didn't.  Okay?  So Frankie Blue was at the Christmas luncheon a couple days ago. 
[01:12:00]  A Christmas luncheon?  They did a Christmas luncheon, and I guess everyone got completely hammered.  I would, too, if I was working over there.  As a matter of fact, I did, many times.  Yeah, he got destroyed, everyone else.  And with the ratings that just came out, I think he had a few extra shots.  Mm-hmm.  Because he's probably thinking, well, my God, I'm a fraud at this point.  Oh, boy.  So then he goes back to the station, and he gets into some kind of argument with the DJ  that was supposed to go on the air.  Now, if he was a little tipsy at the time, I'm thinking it probably wasn't one of those  good, legitimate arguments where you have a point. 
[01:12:30]  I've been in arguments with drunk people.  They don't usually make good points during arguments.  You ever notice that?  What is that?  Why you gotta wear that fucking shirt?  Ooh, there's a good argument.  Yeah, this one will last about 18 hours straight.  Yeah.  So that's what he does.  He goes over there, gets in a little tiff.  And it's the DJ that's supposed to go on the air.  She pretty much runs out of the station crying or something.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  Oh, boy.  But something happened, and she just ran out. 
[01:13:00]  So now someone has to do the radio show.  So who do they get to do the show?  Well, Frankie Blue is the boss over there.  He decides, oh, fuck her.  I'll just do it.  He's gonna take the mic.  Oh, he's not a DJ?  He's not on air?  He's the program guy.  He's a legendary, quote, programmer here in New York.  Was he ever on the air?  You'll see how legendary he is in a minute here.  And then he goes, oh, fuck, I don't need her.  I'll just do her shift, and I'll do probably a better job.  Now, he's doing it for WNEW.  During this, he's talking about KTU, which is their arch rival in competition. 
[01:13:30]  He's just using the KTU call letters.  He makes a mistake and actually says, you know, on 1027 WKTU.  KTU.  And it's NEW.  Yeah, that's the station they're trying to beat.  Yeah.  Oops.  Oh, they must have been loving this at KTU.  I bet they play this and just laugh their balls off.  So Ben has been playing this all morning in the office, just laughing like an idiot.  Like Ben.  I think it's hilarious.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  And Earl's there.  You know, Earl jumps on the air at some point.  Earl was the producer.  Board op.  Yeah.  He's the board op guy.  The girl that does the show is supposed to do that.  And Earl hits the buttons when she goes to commercials and stuff like that.  He operates the board.  Yeah.  So he had to board op for Frankie, who's all hammered.  Right.  And who's his boss.  And who's his boss.  So Earl, I guess you hear him chime in a couple of times, I guess just out of nervousness.  And, you know, he must have been sitting there going, oh, my God.  This guy's hammered.  He can't even talk. 
[01:14:30]  He's stammering.  He's forgetting words.  He hiccups in one word, and it makes the word two words.  Yeah.  And Earl's just like, you can tell he's really nervous.  And then you've got to understand, too, this is one of those radio stations where you talk  really quickly between the music.  The music's the most important thing.  If you're talking more than 30 seconds, you're not doing your job.  He's talking for about four minutes here.  Oh, I know.  We cut it down, but we'll play about two and a half minutes of this.  But he's just babbling about nothing, saying the wrong call letters.  This is the boss of the radio station that was supposed to put WNEW back on the map. 
[01:15:00]  Here you go.  In New York radio.  The boss.  So here, you know what?  I've got to be honest.  If they got Frankie Blue drunk every day to do a radio show, the ratings would go through  the roof.  I'd listen every day.  Absolutely.  And I hate that type of music, but that's the type of thing they should do.  Just get drunks on the air.  Drunk DJs.  Drunk DJs.  Uh-huh.  I love this song.  This is the fucking boss.  I love this song.  He's fucking hammered. 
[01:15:30]  And don't think for a second that this is some kind of relaxed, laid-back delivery.  Yeah, this is not radio from the 70s.  No.  All the DJs were encouraged to talk like this.  This guy's hammered.  This is the type of station where your voice has to be way up there, like, WKTU.  Yeah, high energy.  Summer, everybody.  Don't forget RuPaul at the Barnhead.  Yeah.  High energy.  Your next chance to win $2,000, coming up with RuPaul tomorrow morning, right here.  RuPaul, let's get back to the music.  Right.  The new mix, W-N-A-W.  That's the delivery you're supposed to have. 
[01:16:00]  Right.  And he completely messes up.  You're supposed to hit the post, which is stop talking right when the vocals kick in.  Yeah.  He goes right over the line.  Oh, I know.  He stomps on it.  And he's the boss.  Uh-huh.  I love this song.  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Wow.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been, um, giving you a chance to win $50,000 
[01:16:30]  in cash.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That is snotted.  Wow.  Hey, this is Frankie Blue.  This was the guy that was supposed to get N.E.W. out of the toilet.  He's taking the record off the turntable.  You think he's going to use the turntable?  Oh, I take pleasure in this.  God.  That dumb station.  They really stink.  In the mix 1027 redo and plus win a Toyota Scion. 
[01:17:00]  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning.  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like Publishing 
[01:17:30]  Clearance.  Publishing!  What?  Publishing Clearance?  Did he try to say, like, Publishers Clearinghouse?  Yeah.  Publishing Clearance.  Publishing Clearance.  Oh, man.  Hey, I've been snotted on the air a couple of times, but never.  Your station is cursed!  The devil.  Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like Publishing Clearance.  Or whether it's a house or it's a job. 
[01:18:00]  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you.  And we're going to reward you with $50,000 and a brand new Toyota.  And I don't see how you cannot be happy about that.  This is Frankie Blows.  So make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m.  50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner. 
[01:18:30]  What?  I mean, is they're giving away 50 people going to win a grand?  Wait.  50 grand prize winner.  50 winners of the grand prize?  Or is it 50 grand prize winner?  I don't know.  Or is it a real drunk guy on the air?  And when you do one of these shows, you know, you have to speak perfectly.  Okay.  I know I speak like an idiot.  My grammar stinks.  But it doesn't really matter.  It's a talk show.  It's a dopey talk show.  And if I fuck up, you know, someone's going to jump on me and tell me so. 
[01:19:00]  But at these radio stations, everything has to be just perfect.  Right.  And you're not supposed to just babble and babble.  You've got to get back to the music.  Yeah.  As far as I'm concerned, you guys never fuck up.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  Very sweet.  Just enjoy your hustler and let us do the heavy lifting here, okay?  Isn't that funny?  That's right.  50 grand prize winner of the redo contest of the winner of the Toyota Cyan.  Come on, baby.  You know you want it. 
[01:19:30]  If you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick the winner.  I thought he was really going to go for it.  RuPaul's going to dip his fat cock in that.  He's going to put some Elmer's glue on the tip of his big fat cock.  Because that's a guy, you know.  I'm going to dip it into the winner and pick out one today for you. 
[01:20:00]  Boop, boop, doop, doop, boop, doop, doop, doop, doop.  You know, when we were in the bathroom, I was holding RuPaul's fat cock.  This is the boss.  I love this.  Winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick a winner, and we're going to find you.  Earl lost his mind right there.  And I don't care if it takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right, we have the armored truck. 
[01:20:30]  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town.  So why don't you give me a call?  This is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez.  And telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-MIX-1027.  So give me a call.  Okay, baby?  Thank you.  Oh, yeah, baby.  If you're in your car right now, chances are you're sitting in traffic. 
[01:21:00]  And then he goes back on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we got one more.  This is where he screws up the call letters.  This is really fun.  Which is just probably the biggest radio faux pas you could ever make is screwing up those  calls.  And especially when you screw them up by replacing them with the competition's call letters.  Right.  He's supposed to, for people all over the country, say WNEW.  Right.  But he says KTU, which is their arch rival.  Pick the two stations in your city that battle it out between each other. 
[01:21:30]  And picture one of the jocks being drunk and making the mistake of using the other station's  call.  So here's the boss at our old station.  I'd drink, too, if I was the boss over at that shithole.  Completely hammered.  Ratings are in the toilet.  He has to go on the air.  He thought he could handle it.  And this is some more of him doing his little show.  Mix 1027.  The new Mix 1027.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow. 
[01:22:00]  He's like all the old Foster Brooks.  I'm so excited for tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  A drunken hiccup comes out of him in mid-word.  Nice buzz, man.  Wow.  That must have been a great Christmas luncheon.  Must have been luncheon.  Wait, at what time was this going on?  I guess luncheon.  He's on the air at the 7 to 12 shift at night.  So the luncheon was probably, you know, what, noon, 1? 
[01:22:30]  Noon to 3, 4 maybe?  Love the nooners, man.  Pounding them during the nooners.  Here we go.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky and Rue coming in in the morning.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Putting a hand in the big old barrel and picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner. 
[01:23:00]  50.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo.  Oh, there it is.  Winner of the KTU Mix 102.  Oh, where the hell do I work?  Is he going to start singing Janis Joplin tunes?  Oh, my God.  This doesn't sound like just alcohol, by the way.  That's my opinion.  Dude, this sounds like you're fired.  Yeah.  This is a firing offense. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, because this is the boss.  This isn't some stupid DJ that has a coke problem that you're trying to take care of.  What?  She should be fired for walking off the shift.  What kind of the boss?  Dude, did you just...  He told her to leave or did he just leave?  It just shows you that the old place is still a fucking train wreck.  Yeah, it is.  It's a dump.  Yeah, smart move, getting rid of Opie and Anthony.  The only thing that was happening over there.  Even when you were there, it stunk, except for Ron and Fez.  Those guys did okay.  Well, us and Ron and Fez, we kept the ship going.  Yep. 
[01:24:00]  They were making a lot of money off our show and Ron and Fez.  They should have backed us.  Instead, they got this mess.  Two years later, two and a half years later, they still have nothing.  Some of the most entertaining programming I've ever heard out of that station, though.  Right here.  I would put this guy on the air every day drunk.  Every day drunk.  I would listen every freaking day.  And he's, quote, a legend in New York radio.  Wow.  A fiery wreck today on our wreck cam.  Boy, that's a bad one.  That is a bad one today.  How embarrassed do you think he is this morning if he's up yet? 
[01:24:30]  Oh, my God.  When you wake up sober and you'll hear it, you'll be like, ugh.  All hungover, shaking, feeling a little nauseous.  Your head is pounding and your phone's ringing.  Frankie.  Yeah, Frankie, pick up.  Pick up.  Yeah, I heard your air jet last night.  What, are you stupid?  You fucking drunk?  Get a call from Infinity yet?  You will. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, you will.  Take a couple of aspirin and get your ass out of bed, because I'm sure you'll be in a meeting today.  Can you say fired?  Fired.  Yeah, call up Open Anthony.  They'll give you some pointers on what to do during your time off.  You idiot.  And it's not like nobody's heard this clip.  This clip just hasn't been circulating through the radio circles all morning.  You know, it's like, dude, I emailed it to everybody this morning.  Frankie.  Frankie, it's your mom.  Hi.  How you doing?  Dr. Phil said when you give something up to replace it with something else. 
[01:25:30]  So, I was good to see you giving up the NEW call letters and replacing it with the KTU call letters, you stupid fuck.  I'm your mother, so I can say that.  Come on over.  We'll do shots.  I love you.  Isn't that great?  There's just a little more here.  I got to hear the KTU thing again.  I hear there's a third clip.  No, no.  This is it.  No, this is the...  Rumor has it there's a third clip.  Well, I think this, at this point, is when he was removed.  After this break, he was removed from the station. 
[01:26:00]  Who removed him?  The general manager.  Oh, that is not good.  The GM came in and took him off the air?  He's the Mac Daddy at every radio station.  Doesn't go much higher than the GM.  Who finished the shift?  I would assume they probably just played music on sweepers.  Probably just played music and Earl pushed the button.  That's good.  When your big boss has to come into the studio and you're supposed to be in charge of all your DJs and tell you to get the fuck off the air.  Get off.  You've had it.  You are so fired.  Go home.  Fired.  Come out like the manager going to the mound.  Just get out. 
[01:26:30]  Get out.  Do you got the KTU line in there again?  Did you rewind it a little?  I got to hear him screw up on the calls again.  Yeah.  He's supposed to say WNEW once again.  His winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest.  Oh!  And also you win a Toyota Scion.  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fuck that winner. 
[01:27:00]  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 102.7.  He's stepping all over.  He's supposed to be done by the time those lyrics kick in.  That is like the most important thing in that type of radio.  In that type of radio?  Man, you got to hit the post.  It's called hit the post.  Right, exactly.  What did he say?  We're going to fuck the winner?  That sounded like it.  Oh, is that where they thought he cursed?  Yeah.  I didn't even notice that until we just listened to it.  Toyota Scion. 
[01:27:30]  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel.  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fuck that winner.  Fuck.  What?  What was that?  I think he said fuck.  They're going to fuck that winner.  I think he was going to say fuck and was able to stop just in time.  Fuck that winner.  Fuck that winner.  That's not a word.  Hand in the barrel. 
[01:28:00]  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fuck that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 1027 Frankie Blue.  What's happening?  Tries to have the cool little thing like he's out.  Like, yeah, I meant to step all over the vocal.  Frankie Blue, what's happening, baby?  All I know is that the FCC should hear about that.  Oh.  And they're going to fuck that winner.  At least you guys never said that. 
[01:28:30]  Huh?  Right in the asshole.  Frankie Blue, baby.  Da, da, da.  They're going to stick it in the barrel.  And they're going to pull it out.  And fuck the fucking fucker.  Frankie Blue, baby.  On KTU.  W-N-E double.  W.  The O.P. and Anthony.  K-N-B-C.  Yeah.  On the rock of Boston. 
[01:29:00]  B-C-N.  Where am I?  On W-D-R-U-N-K.  Well, this story is developing, but I do believe he's fired.  Fired.  How long has he been there?  Not too long, man.  He was supposed to be the big hire that was going to turn around that crap hole.  That was it.  He was going to be the guy.  At the turnpike, that big fire.  Jersey turnpike.  You know what that's got to be doing to traffic. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We have audio.  Ridgefield.  General manager coming in to Frankie Blue.  You're fired.  Do you have the audio of Frankie Blue after he was fired?  The, um, if I may.  A little more, um.  All right, I'll.  Yeah.  You're fired.  Wow, you had to tell him twice.  And, uh, trying to console him, I guess.  It's over, Johnny.  Aw.  And then, uh, Frankie Blue.  Okay.  We got some Frankie Blue audio here.  Yeah.  Don't you do it!  Aw.  Don't you! 
[01:30:00]  Oh.  I got nowhere else to go!  Aw.  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nothing else.  Yeah!  I love when it's someone else, man.  Oh.  It's the best.  Oh, it is a treat when it's not us.  All right.  Well, we have to take a break.  These guys are getting bored.  How about this? 
[01:30:30]  I think we got, like, a couple more things to get to before the eggnog drinking contest  for the MiFi.  That's right, baby.  How about we start the contest at 8 o'clock so these guys know?  8 o'clock, we'll start the eggnog drinking contest.  8 o'clock, we're starting the contest.  So, fuck them.  So, they got a half hour if they want to, you know, maybe get coffee or something.  Yeah.  They got a half hour to get there.  Let them know, Hawk.  That's right, baby.  All right.  That's okay, baby.  Frankie Blue here, baby.  We're going to have a winner, and we're going to fuck them, and we're going to... 
[01:31:00]  I can play that all morning.  Oh, it's classic.  Ben, good call, by the way.  I wasn't sure if we should go with it.  I love it.  I wasn't sure if it was that good, but it is hilarious.  This is the Opie and Anthony show here at Sirius Satellite Radio.  That's right, baby.  Now, what would be good to play here is the Casey Kasem thing.  Hi.  Just to go into, you know...  DJ's tirades?  Yeah.  That is a good one.  You got? 
[01:31:30]  And now, a long-distance dedication.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  This one's about dogs.  Yeah, it's right in there.  We'll play this a little later.  All right, we'll play this Casey Kasem as we go to break, and the eggnog drinking contest  is 30 minutes away from right now, Anthony.  All right, baby.  All right, baby.  All right, baby.  The Countdown will begin this Sunday afternoon at 1, right here on the radio station you grew  up with, music radio 138.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, geez, well, isn't it the last hour?  We got another hour to do?  Geez, I thought we were almost finished.  Good golly, Miss Molly.  Boy, this is fucking ponderous, man.  Ponderous, fucking ponderous.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40 has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning and every Saturday morning at 2, 2.  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand, whether 
[01:32:30]  we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio.  And here's what he writes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere,  and it'll mean a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles, but he was most certainly a part of...  Let's start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please. 
[01:33:00]  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those  transitions, and then you've got to go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for, but goddamn it, if we can't come out of a slow  record, I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay.  I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking up-tempo  record every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week. 
[01:33:30]  Since the last goddamn time, I want somebody who's his fucking brain to not come out of  a goddamn record that's up-tempo, and I've got to talk about a fucking dog dying.  The very worst of the opiate Anthony F.U.  line.  I ain't giving a big F.U.  to Father Trucker out there.  He must be driving out in the middle of a piece of bubble fucks.  You drive around the city, it's New York, Connecticut, you see them girls playing with  themselves.  You see them mini skirts. 
[01:34:00]  And Norton, just to let you know, it's better when you're sitting in traffic and the cars  are going the same way.  You look back a little bit through the windshield, you can see right up the girl's skirt.  Little trick of a trade there.  So fuck you, Father Trucker.  This F.U. is for Steve, see, for putting that goddamn baby without a face video on your  website?  Oh, I can't get that damn image out of my head.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm sending a big F.U. out to Eric.  I got the perfect name for him.  Eric the Awful. 
[01:34:30]  Ray Stevens has a song about him, goes with it, perfect.  You little fag bitch.  Good job on the show the other day.  Fuck off.  Yeah, I'd like to send out a big F.U. to Swift, Snyder, and J.B. Hunt.  Stay the hell out of the hammer lane.  Thank you, cowboy.  This is a great big fuck you, you nasty old fucking lard-ass fucking rich bitch whore.  In New York with your fucking hawks.  I'll pluck a couple of diamonds off your fucking ears, put them in a slingshot, and kill them 
[01:35:00]  sorry fucking hawks.  Screw them things, bitch.  Yeah, I got a big fuck you to give out to you faggots for never playing my fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE1.  1-866-FU-LINE1.  Well, fuck you very much.  Unleash the power of XM performance in your home.

Am I the only one that didn't know how to pronounce his last name until I just heard that? 
[01:39:00]  Nope.  I always thought it was Chiannese or...  Chiannese.  Well, everyone has problems with it.  Yeah.  Where'd that come from?  He stopped by yesterday.  You guys were long gone.  He came in around 4 o'clock.  For what?  Well, yeah.  With the Broadway people?  Frank's place?  Or Broadway people?  Broadway people.  And I walked over.  I said, can we get a couple of IDs?  Broadway.  So we have a Norton ID and we have an ONA ID.  That's great.  Dude, a freaking Uncle Junior came to me and said, that's freaking crazy.  You remember the time you chased him off the plane?  Oh, we flew back from him.  We did Buffalo.  Yes.  Yeah, I got a picture with him in an airport. 
[01:39:30]  He's walking and I'm smiling with the same exact shirt that I have.  No, you went off running.  I know.  That was after you got nailed at security when we got on the plane in Buffalo.  I got Michael Imperioli.  I got Newark Airport.  So I got a couple of those guys.  How many of the Sopranos do you have pictures with?  I think just those two.  Not Tony, though?  No, no, no.  I've never seen him.  But Imperioli wanted nothing to do with me.  Right at the security line, I asked him.  Really?  I recognized him.  I'm like, holy shit.  And I'm like, hey, man, I love your work.  And I'm like, don't bother the guy in the airport.  But I had my camera.  I'm like, why did you buy this?  Of course you had your camera. 
[01:40:00]  So I walked through the security and he's still there getting his stuff.  So I'm like, hey, man, can I get a shot with you?  And he's like, ugh.  But his friend was there.  So I asked his friend to take the picture.  And the flash wasn't working.  I'm like, all right.  Oh, just all things wrong with a photo op.  I know.  So we're standing there.  And I take my sunglasses off thinking he'll do the same thing.  But he doesn't.  No.  So I look like the faggot fan.  And he looks like the cool guy, which was accurate.  And his friend is like taking the picture.  I'm like, hold it down.  And his friend's like, I got it.  So I got two shots with him.  His friend snapped at me. 
[01:40:30]  What a son of a bitch.  No, he was right.  I was being annoying.  Remember the time you met Tiger Woods?  Yeah, but I didn't get a picture with him.  Only an autograph.  I didn't do pictures back then.  I just didn't do them back then.  I only did autographs.  Kenison autographed a lot of them.  No pictures.  No pictures.  Remember the time you met 50 Cent?  Yeah, I got a picture with him, though.  He just talked about that, Kenny.  Prior autograph, no picture.  Kenny, is everything okay out there?  Yeah, I'm keeping an eye on everybody.  We're getting ready for the eggnog drinking contest.  And Kenny's very observant.  What did you just observe from the guy from Frank's place? 
[01:41:00]  He's sitting in his little cubicle watching porno on the computer.  Is he really?  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  That guy.  Somebody needs to talk to that guy.  I like that, though.  Nothing wrong with...  All of a sudden, he went up a couple of notches in Jimmy's bucket.  Nothing wrong with looking at a little porno at work.  Everyone does it, Kenny.  Yeah, but he's doing it in secret.  I wonder what else he does secretly in private.  I don't know.  That's his secret.  He's starting to grow on me.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Just another guy who works.  What else is growing on you? 
[01:41:30]  That's it.  Hey, Kenny, why don't you...  Make my big announcement?  Oh, no.  That's after the eggnog drinking contest.  Okay.  But I thought it's like prime time now.  That's the teaser, though.  All right.  All right.  Well, when are we starting at?  At 8 o'clock.  You're not paying attention.  Yeah.  I hear there's a guy that had his stomach, what, stapled or something, and he's going  to do the contest?  Oh, no.  And he had gastric bypass.  So how big...  Why is he doing the contest?  How big could his stomach possibly be?  About that big.  Size of your palm or...  Size of like a... 
[01:42:00]  Not even half of your palm.  Size of like a plum or a peach?  Yeah, like Steve C.  Smaller.  And he's going to do the eggnog drinking contest?  He's insane.  For the Wi-Fi?  Where is Steve?  Get old chestnut stomach in here.  Well, no.  Let's get the guy that's going to be in the contest.  I've got to talk to this guy.  Where is he?  He's puking.  All right, well...  Is he crazy?  It's for the Wi-Fi, Anthony.  We're going to do the eggnog drinking contest.  Double shots of eggnog.  One per minute until there's only one guy that didn't puke.  And then he'll walk away with the Wi-Fi.  Last left standing.  It's Ellis. 
[01:42:30]  Where are you from, Ellis?  Philadelphia.  I did your sticker stop.  Oh, right on, man.  Thanks for helping us out with that.  Now, you used to be a lot bigger, I would guess.  About 150 pounds bigger.  Wow.  Okay.  Got to picture that.  So you know you have no shot in this contest.  You just want to come down here and have fun and puke for us?  Sure.  I'm thinking maybe there'll be nothing in my little stomach and I'll have nothing to puke.  You're thinking it's just going to go through you.  But where is it going to end up?  Because even if you take a leak, you lose.  I could hold it pretty long.  Yeah?  What do you think, Steve C.? 
[01:43:00]  I think he's done for.  If he's trying to go do shots of eggnog after having a gastric bypass procedure.  A what?  What's a bypass?  Bypass.  Sorry.  Bypass.  Thank you, Frankie Blue.  I was just going to say that.  Frankie Blue.  Damn it.  Steve Blue.  I see that's the perfect diction on this show.  I'm here with icebergs on my shirt.  Gastric bypass, baby.  Frankie Blue.  And then we're going to f**k you. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, Steve, baby.  Your stomach just won't hold that much content.  Even after two years, it just won't.  The one thing he's also got to watch out for is what's called dumping.  And not the Ben kind of dumping.  Is too much sugar or too much dairy will cause you to sweat profusely and pass out if you have gastric bypass.  That's always good.  That is the Ben kind of dumping.  Anyway.  All right.  Thank you.  Steve is the expert on the stomach stapling.  So how many shots do you think you could do? 
[01:44:00]  Or how many cups here?  Totally nailed it.  Well, I have a minute to get him down, so I think I'll be all right.  How many do you think you could do?  We're thinking the winner's going to do, what, 30, Anthony?  40?  Yeah.  It's got to be over 30, I would think.  Yeah.  I'll do my best.  Oh, three or four.  I think it's going to be a problem for you, my friend.  But at least you're down here having a good time.  Hey, I'm glad to be here.  Ellis.  All right.  There he goes.  Ellis from PA.  Thank you, Ellis.  Ellis.  There he is.  Ellis. 
[01:44:30]  Oh.  Totally nailed.  That's Steve, too.  A lot of people saying, don't let this guy drink.  Speck and Zetak.  Ellis?  Mike from PA.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, just letting you know, man, that guy who got his stomach stapled, you can't let him  drink, man.  One of my buddies had that done.  He went to a bar.  He had a few drinks.  He damn near died.  He ended up in the hospital.  No, dude, this is eggnog.  There's no alcohol.  Yeah, there's no alcohol.  Steve drinks all the time.  He's fine.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Steve can drink five, six martinis in a clip.  Yeah, this is eggnog.  There's no booze in it.  He should be all right.  Those olives in his stomach just trying to punch their way out of that little, little  stomach.  No bigger than Connors.  I figured it was late in the show already.  And no better at holding things.  Rich from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, man, I had stomach stapled surgery three years ago, and to this day, if I even eat  a little bit too much, I puke.  Yeah.  Yeah, but...  Well, I'm glad the guy's taking one for the team. 
[01:45:30]  He'll be the first one to puke, it looks like.  Everyone's going to puke.  He'll just be first.  Okay, and we have a nurse on the line.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike the nurse.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, my name is Mike.  I'm from New Jersey.  You're a nurse?  Yeah, I'm a nurse.  No, I'm not a bagot, dude.  But you're a nurse.  Are you one of the ones that smothers the old people?  Yeah.  And has like 55 dead people on his resume?  Male nurses are the creepiest bunch of guys.  Always unkempt hair and a bad mustache and 55 murders.  Always under investigation.  Yeah, thinking they're doing a favor. 
[01:46:00]  Going for these people a favor.  How come the hospital I work at has, you know, 50 dead people that they can't account for?  Well, then they go back over their history and every hospital.  Well, they were in a hospital in Duluth and there were 40 the first week he was there.  Yeah.  We had two dead people in a year.  No, no, no, man.  That's not me.  No, huh?  No.  Yeah, I worked in a South Jersey hospital where I was a travel nurse man.  And the hospital I work at does, the technical procedure is called the Ruin Y. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, yeah?  And their stomach is literally only the size of a chocolate.  You know, I once worked in a hospital.  You did, Kenny?  Yeah, but I got fired for throwing the colostomy bags around like water balloons.  Oh, man.  You've never seen one of those clothes, have you?  Hey, give me that.  I want to throw my coffee at Kenny.  Better than a phone caller.  All right, thank you, Mike.  Thank you.  All right, man.  I'm not punching out. 
[01:47:00]  Mike, Mike, Mike.  Yo, what's up?  Oh, God, that was too easy.  Rich from Philly.  Yo, guys, what's up?  Hi, Rich.  Thanks for calling the program.  Yo, you got to let that guy drink.  Yeah, why?  Oh, it'll be a chain reaction.  You get everybody puking early.  You know, I agree with you.  Yeah, I agree.  Because that's the beauty of these puking contests.  One guy starts puking and then everyone starts puking and we start dry heaving.  It's a chain reaction.  Are we going to reek in here?  This is a little studio.  Are we going to get video of this?  We have to get video of this. 
[01:47:30]  We got the video ready to go.  Good.  Have they been eating some of the food that they brought out there also?  No, no one's eating.  They're kind of being smart.  Oh, because they really want to win the MyFind.  I know.  All right.  The stench in the studio in Boston at BCN was like for days after the clam chowder.  Oh, great.  We got to bring that content back again.  Hot, steamy clam chowder gurgling up in their stomach.  Anthony, the Frankie Blue thing reminded me of something.  A lot of Christmas parties this time of year and a lot of the companies warn their employees  about sexual harassment. 
[01:48:00]  Yes, they do.  A lot of that happens around the holidays.  As a matter of fact, I read an article recently about England.  In England, some company was putting out a whole thing on Christmas party etiquette.  What not to do.  And they had to write things down like no grabbing women's tits.  And if you have to write that down, like people are just going around, jolly good.  Hey, bird.  And then another one was no copying your posterior or genitalia on the copy machine. 
[01:48:30]  Doesn't that seem like a Christmas party thing to do, though?  Little lights passing over those small, pale English genitals.  But is anybody looking at that going, oh, we can't do that?  I thought a good uncircumcised picture of my rotten little colonizing dick.  I thought you'd like my imperialist war-making cock.  I love the British.  They've done nothing but can rule the world for the last 200 years.  Can't tell if it's an ugly English vag or their gums. 
[01:49:00]  Their scurvy gums.  Spot of tea, then.  Meh.  Meh.  Why is Kenny still in front of him, Mike?  He's waiting to do his announcement.  No, I'm just standing here.  All right.  I'm still standing.  Here, here, here.  For his big announcement.  I can't wait, quite frankly.  Is he going to just stand there looking stupid for the next hour and a half? 
[01:49:30]  That's what he does anywhere.  Yeah.  What else does he do?  Yeah.  Maybe he's uncomfortable just standing there waiting.  No.  You kind of look like a statue.  To be uncomfortable, you would have to have the capacity to think about it.  Exactly.  He could just stand there and he's like the guy from Sling Blade standing in front of the  kid's door until the fag showed up and let him in.  You just stand there.  How long have you been there?  Quite some spell.  You know?  But he doesn't care.  That's how he is. 
[01:50:00]  Kenny, would you like some French fried potatoes?  Potatoes.  I'd like one of them muffins.  All right.  Well.  Don't talk about that boy.  You dead the boy.  You shouldn't hear them things.  J.T. Walsh.  Hey.  He told me how he molested kids.  What a sicko that was in the beginning and end of the movie telling his sick stories  to the Sling Blade guy.  To Cajablaid.  Cajablaid.  Great movie.  But that's how he is. 
[01:50:30]  Just he's a little, you know.  He's just happy to be there.  But he's just making everyone uncomfortable.  He's just standing there.  I'll leave.  Staring.  Trying to take it all in.  Yeah.  Most of it's not registering.  Yeah.  And I can't comprehend it.  In one ear and out the other.  That's right, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  Why don't you go out there and make sure everyone's ready?  Because we're going to have the contestants come in in about 10 minutes.  Okay.  And we're going to get this thing going.  There he goes.  Club soda, Kenny, everyone.  Can't wait for his announcement. 
[01:51:00]  I know.  It's going to be exciting.  Sexual harassment audio, Anthony.  Yes.  So, yeah.  A lot of people have to go through this.  It's a big thing when you get a new job at a big company.  One day they set aside and you have to go and sit and listen to lectures and watch films.  And it teaches you how not to get into trouble with sexual harassment in the workplace.  Let's go to the audio.  You hear about sexual harassment on TV and it makes the headlines in newspapers. 
[01:51:30]  As an employee, what do you need to know about it?  First, sexual harassment is against the law.  And it's against your company's policy.  So, what is sexual harassment?  Linda, you are doing a fine job here.  Oh, well, thank you, Steve.  But, you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here. 
[01:52:00]  There may be physical harassment.  Wow.  You're really tense today, Nancy.  Ow!  Bill!  Sorry.  You looked really tense.  You know, I really don't like it when you do that.  Can you please stop?  I'll never stop, Nancy.  Never.  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal.  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock. 
[01:52:30]  Yes, I do.  I've got a fat cock, too.  Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.  Maybe a little oil.  Two fat cocks together.  Oil.  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.  Sexual harassment is not always about sex.  It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate. 
[01:53:00]  Man.  I could go for a power fuck right now.  Change is slow, and what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment.  Smells like vagina in here.  Excuse me?  Smells like fresh vagina in here.  Are you talking about my vagina?  Maybe.  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect. 
[01:53:30]  Treat your coworkers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.  It's your company's policy, and it's the law.  There you go.  Why are you laughing at it?  I think we taught some people something there.  Yeah, it's a public service announcement for our listeners, you know.  This tape came right from Washington from Lawyer Lady.  This is what they're playing down there in Washington at the XM Satellite Radio facility, Anthony.  Of course. 
[01:54:00]  They take sexual harassment very seriously.  Yes, they do.  You could tell just by listening to that.  A fat cock.  A fat cock.  One guy around the office has a fat cock.  I can think of someone from Sirius that can't wait to get a new job here.  All right.  Relax.  Wow.  Let it go.  So you lost $50,000.  It's no big deal.  I hear you've got a fat cock.  Jesus.  He can hold a grudge, can't he?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  And a fat cock.  All right, I think it's time for the egg not drinking contest.  Oh, yeah.  It's just about. 
[01:54:30]  Just about.  Now, we're going to have a side bet or whatever.  We're going to have some people from all over the country.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, they're going to be.  Do we have those three people already that we've got to get?  Oh, you have all five, possibly?  We might have all five.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  We have five faithful listeners from around the country.  Make sure they're from far away, man.  If they could get here.  Like, PA's not far.  Jersey's not far.  New York State can be far.  It might not be far.  Right, right, right.  Why do they have to be close?  Florida's far.  And get them all on the phone, because those guys could kind of drive here to be in the 
[01:55:00]  contest.  I want to take care of the people that are really far away, have no shot whatsoever of  coming down here to be in any of these contests.  Gotcha.  That's thoughtful.  Los Angeles is far.  Seattle's far.  What do we got, Eric?  Besides from one guy in Pennsylvania, we have Texas, Arkansas, Ohio, Illinois, and Maine.  Perfect.  How far in Pennsylvania?  It could be far.  I'm not sure.  We're going to find out right now.  It could be five, six hours.  No, we don't want to be, you know, we don't want to wreck the guy's day. 
[01:55:30]  No, he's in either.  He's in.  But for future contests, they've got to be kind of far or further than PA.  Get them on the phone, because then what we're going to do, these guys are going to  pretty much tell us how many shots they think the last guy is going to do.  Right.  The last guy?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You know what I mean?  I thought it was going to be maybe the last guy pukes.  Yeah.  So how many shots did the winner officially do without puking, right?  And then the guy that's closest without going over wins.  Got you.  How about in the event of a tie, you have one question is how many before the first guy 
[01:56:00]  pukes.  You throw in an extra question, so one's a tiebreaker in case it's a tie.  Well, there can't be a tie, though.  They can't give the same answer?  No, no.  Because if one guy says 28, that's done.  Yeah, but now what we're saying is you just said without going over.  Right.  But I thought we didn't care about the going over part unless it's a tie.  Yeah, but then that doesn't matter.  You know what I mean? 
[01:56:30]  Let's say the winner does 30 shots.  Okay, let's say.  30.  So one guy says 31, and then a guy says 29.  Right.  So now there's a tie.  So now the guy that went over is out.  Right, but let's say the guy does 30 shots.  Right.  Some guy said 31.  Right.  And the next closest said 20.  31 wins.  Now 31 wins.  Yeah, 31 wins.  So the only way we bring in the...  Anthony.  Wait, yes?  Most of our listeners are really stupid, though.  We have to spell it out for them. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm trying to...  They don't want to think too hard.  They just want to enjoy the program.  Oh, they all like Club Soda Kenny?  How about if you're over, you're over.  That's it.  Closest without going over.  Because that could get really stupid.  Not really.  We got five guys.  They're going to get pretty close.  What if they all go over?  And then what if someone says the one, you know, goes one over the next?  I hate that rule.  How about, all right, if everyone goes over, then the guy closest wins.  It's always the guy closest to the number.  Dude, I was a math genius growing up. 
[01:57:30]  Let me do this.  I say closest to the number.  I'm saying closest to the number.  Unless it's a tie, then if you're under...  Right.  The only way it could be a tie is if somebody is one above and one below the real number.  You want to do it that way?  Yes.  We got to do it that way.  And then the one below would win in the event of a tie.  That totally takes that stupid strategy out where they go one more than the last guy's  guess.  I hate that.  You want to bust into that Price is Right TV screen and just stick your fat cock in their  mouth.  Yeah.  All right.  Two fat cocks in a thin microphone. 
[01:58:00]  A little oil.  All right.  We got my fives to give away.  It's the portable XM satellite radio.  Everybody wants its portable radio this holiday season.  And Opie, so we're going to be giving a my five to one of the people in the contest and  then the other my five we're going to give to somebody on the phone.  What's wrong, Frankie Blue?  Nothing.  Yeah.  You're insane.  You're insane.  All right. 
[01:58:30]  Why don't you explain what that is?  What?  Mr. Brave Man.  That's my Ben Stein impression.  Oh, very good.  Did you say Jew down?  I got in a big battle with Ben Stein on our show.  I remember.  We had Ben Stein on hold and we were going to do an interview with him.  And he was on hold during the last commercial break that we were doing.  And I did a live read for some company.  Car Cash.  Car Cash.  And I said, it's great because you can sell your car.  You don't have people coming there trying to chew down the price that you put on your 
[01:59:00]  car.  We pop Ben Stein on and say hello.  And he goes, did you say Jew down the price?  And we thought he was joking.  So like, no, no.  And I was honest with him.  And I said, no.  I said, chew down.  He goes, well, what you meant was Jew down the price.  And that's derogatory.  And then we realized he was serious.  And I'm like, Ben, I said, chew down the price.  Yes.  But we all know what that means.  It's like, God, fuck off, man. 
[01:59:30]  What you're forgetting is that it was a tied in with a wood theme.  Like, you know, it was almost like it was a beaver car or some weird shit.  So chew down kind of fit in.  Chew down.  With the theme of whatever the company's name was.  Believe me.  If I wanted to be offensive, I would have done it.  And you were reading from it.  You were trying.  You weren't making it up.  You were reading it.  Yeah.  And he got all upset.  It's like, oh, super defensive Jew, man.  Got all pissed off.  All right.  Yeah.  And he's actually a nice guy.  I did a tough crowd with him.  Oh, stop it.  You're not going to get work from Ben Stein.  I'll never see him again.  You're not going to kiss his ass. 
[02:00:00]  He was actually very nice.  I was surprised.  Whatever.  Remove your lips from my ass.  I didn't think I would like him.  Whatever.  No, I did like him.  He's a dick.  He was nice to me.  Whatever.  Monday.  Whatever.  All right.  Anthony, so here's the deal.  You.  We got 10 contestants outside.  The one that drinks the most eggnog without puking will win the MiFi.  And then we have a side thing going on for the rest of the country.  We got, wow, these guys, their freaking guesses are way off.  You think?  If you guys are listening to me on the phone, if you want to change your guess, 
[02:00:30]  I highly recommend it.  Even that one?  Why?  The second one down?  Well, the one looks more accurate, in my opinion.  I'm not going to say which one because I've got to keep it fair for everybody.  But we're looking at the screen, and I would say, one, two, three,  four of the guys are so off, it's not even funny.  You don't even have a shot.  I think the second one down is in the ballpark.  Mm-hmm.  And the one...  We said Jared's in, by the way.  Second from the bottom.  Second from the bottom?  Yeah, he's, you know, I think that's getting close. 
[02:01:00]  All right, it'll be up to these guys.  So then we got five or six contestants from around America,  and the one that guesses how many shots the winner does without puking  will also win a MiFi, basically.  Right.  With Anthony's little, you know, rules.  Like tabulations.  Anthony will figure that out.  Okay.  So we got Aaron from Texas.  Aaron?  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  How are you?  Pretty good.  All right.  You want to win the MiFi, obviously.  And how many shots do you think the winner will do without puking?  Okay.  We're not going for the first puke, but the winner? 
[02:01:30]  The winner.  Yeah, we're not...  Okay, maybe that's where you guys were confused.  The guy, the last guy standing, how many shots will he do without puking?  Let's say 32.  All right.  Now we're, in my opinion, now we're talking.  He's saying 32 shots.  Yeah, that's what I thought you said earlier, the first one to puke.  That's why I changed it back down.  All right.  Do they have your phone numbers just in case we lose you?  Because this contest could take up to an hour.  Okay, 903?  No, no, no, no.  You don't want to give it on the air, bro.  Yeah, give it out on the air. 
[02:02:00]  I know you guys are stupid in Texas, but you don't want to do that.  All right, hold on.  Now we go to Arkansas and talk to Dave.  Dave.  Yeah.  How many shots will the winner do without puking?  37.  30 what?  37.  Oh, 37.  Okay.  All right.  And we got your phone number, too?  Yes.  All right.  Hold on.  You're going to have to fix these amounts up on the screen here, guys in the control room.  Yeah.  Oh, they're doing it now.  Thank you.  The next one is Tim from PA. 
[02:02:30]  Go ahead, Tim.  Jim, I'm sorry.  I'm changing it to 29 if it's the winner.  The last guy, right.  All right.  You think the last guy will have 29 shots of eggnog in him, and he will not puke?  He said 29, not 39.  29.  39.  29.  29.  Jim, shut up.  Not you, Jim.  The one stuffing his face with a fucking cupcake.  Look at him eat.  What is that?  And then he'll have sushi later and go, look, dude, I'm eating right.  And I had grilled vegetables and a little chicken for dinner. 
[02:03:00]  This is what your problem is right there.  I don't care.  With blue sprinkles that are all over his tongue.  Now his tongue's turning blue.  That's good.  No, that's not from the sprinkles, Anthony.  Oh.  From the hep.  Hey, Chuck.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Where are you from?  I'm from Ohio.  Ohio checking in.  Good.  Okay.  Sir.  Write that.  Chuck's from Ohio.  And Chuck, how many shots will the guy do?  I'm going to start with my original guess of 40.  All right.  You were the one we thought was the most accurate. 
[02:03:30]  You know, our opinion means nothing.  We've never really done this before.  But I'm thinking 40 shots is a pretty good guess, though.  Sure.  Yeah, I'm thinking that's a lot of eggnog.  That's about 80 ounces, anyway.  All right.  Thank you.  Chuck, stay there.  No, don't take care.  Just stay on the line.  Jim from Illinois.  Yeah.  Hey, Jim.  How are you?  All right.  Enjoying the program today?  Yes, I am.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  All right.  How many shots will the winner do without puking?  All right.  I'm changing what I told you earlier.  I'm going to go with 33.  Oh. 
[02:04:00]  Very strategic with your guess.  33 shots of eggnog without puking.  All right, Jim.  Scientific thing, you know.  And we got all your numbers, right?  Yeah.  Just in case we hang up on you or your phone goes dead or whatever.  Okay.  And finally, the guy that just absolutely hates Ben.  Jared.  How are you doing?  Now that you're officially in the contest, do you still hate Ben?  No, Ben's all right.  Oh.  That's right.  I would have liked to have been there, though.  He appreciates the messy-haired dick now. 
[02:04:30]  You know what?  Crazy-haired.  Fuck.  Crazy-haired.  Jared, we owe you one.  So you're on the VIP list.  You hear a show you want to check out, you just give us a call, and you can come down from Maine.  All right?  Nice.  All right.  So how many shots will the winner do without puking?  I'm going 35.  35.  35.  Wow.  A lot in the mid-30 range.  Okay.  35 shots of eggnog without puking.  All right, Jared.  Hold on the line, okay?  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  I guess we could start filling up the cups with eggnog. 
[02:05:00]  Ah, the festivities begin.  We will take a quick break, and the eggnog drinking contest for the MiFi, the portable  XM satellite radio, will begin in moments.  But first, it's Brother Joe.  Cool.  And a little holiday favorite.  Nice.  Hey, man, you want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man.  The police, they got my car.  What do you mean, the police got your car?  Just what I said.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  You stupid ass.  The police, they got my car.

[02:08:30]  ACC football.  ACC football.  The ACC Today.  Maryland.  Virginia.  UNC.  Duke.  MC State.  Wake Forest.  Georgia Tech.  Clemson.  FSU.  And new to the ACC.  Virginia Tech.  And Miami.  It's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  I'm Ari Mykofsky with the ACC Today.  Let's push forward a little bit to Tuesday, December the 21st.  That's the date where XM Satellite Radio will kick off our bowl coverage with the Champs Sports Bowl between Georgia Tech and Syracuse. 
[02:09:00]  You can hear that game on ACC Channel 180 at 7.30 p.m. Eastern.  We've got a chance to talk to Syracuse head coach Paul Pascalone about the game against the Wreck.  What are the keys that you expect to get a win against this Rambo Wreck squad?  Yeah, I think that one of the things is that we're going to have to be able to move the ball against an outstanding defense.  Georgia Tech's defense is rated the number 14 defense in all of Division I football.  I don't see many teams that they've played this year who have successfully run the ball or moved the ball consistently against them. 
[02:09:30]  So one of the keys to this game is going to be our ability to keep our offense on the field.  That's Syracuse head coach Paul Pascalone.  From a coach to a player's perspective, James Butler is the starting defensive back for Georgia Tech, and he talks about the keys to the game against the Orange.  The key to me, I think, is stop the run.  They're predominantly a run team, and stop their run, their option attack, and be ready for their option pass, 
[02:10:00]  because they can't allow you to sleep if you're not paying attention to it.  So just stopping those things, just going out there playing fundamental football, I think we'll turn out all right.  It's James Butler's Yellow Jackets taking on the Syracuse Orange in the Champs Sports Bowl on ACC Channel 180  on Tuesday, December the 21st at 7.30 p.m. Eastern.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.

[02:12:00]  So be it.  Hold on a look.  Bread no more.  Just a few pieces.  To prepare for more.  So be it.  Settle the score.  Touch me again with the words that you will hear evermore.  Gotta love Metallica.  Goddamn.  Never gets old, right, Anthony?  No. 
[02:12:30]  This is drive-like 90-mile-an-hour music.  Oh, yeah.  Love it.  I think it's time for the eggnog drinking contest on the Opie and Anthony program.  Steve is in place with his video camera,  filming it for opieandanthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Oh, I hate these type of things.  I kind of get giddy.  I like these things.  Look at all the eggnog is out.  Many cups lined up.  Yes, our ten contestants. 
[02:13:00]  My brother Darren's going to be one of the official pours.  Hey, now.  Mathematically, this is a little rough  because if these guys are doing shots every minute  and there's ten guys, do a little quick math.  That would be six seconds per cup.  Five seconds to pour out each cup  so that everyone's ready for the next shot.  I'm up for the challenge.  You're up for the challenge.  Yes, absolutely.  It's a challenge within a challenge, Opie.  Do we have enough eggnog opened up?  I think this is going to be just a clusterfuck. 
[02:13:30]  I mean, I have confidence in our guys, but I don't know.  I think something's going to go horribly wrong here, Anthony.  Do the animals.  I think it's probably closer to five seconds per pour  because you're going to need a little bit of time  for them to then pick it up and do the shot.  Yes.  You know, the in-between time.  This sounds like the Warren Commission, you know, with the shots.  I need to reload the cartridge before I pour again.  He can't possibly reload those cups quick enough.  You have me consorting with a real cast of beverages. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  It looks like they've got a system in place.  All right.  We'll see if it works out.  Noah's helping out.  It's his birthday today.  Oh.  Happy birthday, Noah.  Happy birthday.  Will you be banging a porn star for your birthday today?  Next month, hopefully.  Next month, hopefully.  We're getting in on the books.  She'll be back.  Did she call you or text you with a happy birthday message?  No, not yet.  She knows, though.  We talked last night, so she's good to go.  Oh, you talked last night.  Yeah, we did.  You guys really have something going.  No, not really.  I think we kindled a little something.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, you do.  You anxiously wait for a phone call.  It's kind of a relationship.  You know when you're next seeing each other. 
[02:14:30]  You call and talk to each other or text each other.  Technically, it's a relationship.  It's really low maintenance.  That's for sure.  I've got to give you that one.  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  You don't have a steady?  No.  That wouldn't last very long at this point.  No?  No.  No, because he's banging a porn star on the side.  What girlfriend's going to put up with that?  Yeah, that is kind of tough to tell your girlfriend.  A really good one.  A really good one.  There's a few of them out there that would.  Would, but.  I guess.  I don't know.  Congrats.  All right.  Thank you.  And then we've got Nathaniel.  In between doing stand-up, he's now an official pourer in the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:15:00]  Well, we all have dreams, Opie.  All right.  I guess we're ready for the contestants.  Oh, boy.  I just had a cup.  I could probably do five shots.  Really?  Really?  Is it thick and creamy and noggy?  Yeah, but it has a watery undertone to it.  It's thick with a watery undertone.  You know what?  It's like drinking a blood clot.  Listen.  Listen, you're good, but Anthony is brilliant when it comes to describing what contestants 
[02:15:30]  have to direct.  You did such a great job with the chowder eating contest.  The chowder was easy to describe.  Eggnog is a little harder, but it is, I don't know, a creamy mix.  There you go.  Just thick and creamy with a heavy flavor of vanilla.  Lukewarm.  Lukewarm.  And unfortunately, the cups are a little too tall to fill it up to the tippity top.  But it's up to the tippity top of the line.  Of the line.  Pushing a little over the line.  And you just have to swig it down. 
[02:16:00]  Perhaps it backs up a little in your esophagus where you can't get it down quite fast enough.  You've got to give it an extra swallow.  So you've got to wish you had maybe a little piece of bread to kind of tamp it down.  And then before you know it, oh, the next shot.  Ready to go.  Thick and creamy like the first.  Filled right up to the tippy top of that line.  And down she goes for another one.  Gulp.  And oh, before it even reaches your stomach. 
[02:16:30]  Before you feel that gentle caress of thick nog lining your stomach walls.  Bam, it's time for another.  And the cup is full in front of you.  And just like the first two, you belt it down.  And thick and hearty and creamy as it is.  And getting warmer and warmer.  It works its way down.  Just a little warmer than the last shot.  And you just know shot after shot after shot is going to get a little warmer and warmer and warmer. 
[02:17:00]  And the ones at the edge next to Steve's shirt are going to be bubbling.  Creeping hot, dare I say.  So good luck to all our contestants washing this mix down.  That's how you describe it, Morton.  Wonderful.  He's the pro.  It's hilarious.  All right, let's get the contestants in here.  We've stalled enough.  Bringing them in.  Ten of them, huh?  You're going to have room for all these guys?  Ten contestants.  Filthy, savage, wretched creature.  We've had to remove.  I want to let everyone know that knows the description of the studio. 
[02:17:30]  We've had to remove the lesbian couch.  That space is now replaced with lined garbage pails.  And that works, guys.  It looks like my bathroom floor.  Yeah, there's plastic on the floor.  And there's garbage pails.  There's garbage pails where the lesbian couch usually is.  And, guys, I cannot emphasize enough that those pails are there.  They are to be used just in case that creamy, thick mix of egg and nog starts working its way back up. 
[02:18:00]  You can turn around, grab a pail, and go to town.  All right, well, why don't we meet our contestants, Anthony?  Let's meet our contestants.  And don't forget we've got five other contestants from all over the country that are playing as well.  Right.  They guessed how many shots the last guy's going to do without puking.  We'll see who's right, and they will see by my five as well.  Who do we got?  How you doing, guys?  I'm Dice.  Hey, Dice.  What's up?  I brought you those shirts.  I brought some DVDs this time around. 
[02:18:30]  I just got to say, that shit dick song fucked me up.  Yeah, you like the shit dick?  I was banging a chick in the ass on Wednesday night.  I finish, and I'm humming shit dick the whole time.  It's not the best thing you want to do.  The chick I'm banging likes a shit dick.  We'll play that again for you.  Thank you.  All right, as soon as you puke, we'll play that for you.  Works for me.  Where are you from, Dice?  Long Island.  Long Island, right on.  Of course.  We met Pat.  Pat.  Hi.  From earlier.  I really should be working to pay off those tickets.  Yeah, he did our last contest. 
[02:19:00]  It cost him like $900.  Yeah.  Because he decided you could just, yeah, park your van in the middle of 57th Street in New York City.  He had a suspended license.  He got arrested for it.  He even stands like a psychopath.  With the hands straight down, not moving.  How much do you weigh, Pat?  $350.  $350.  He's got to be one of the favorites.  I'm thinking the fatter guys are the favorites.  You think?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, this would be my forte.  Forte.  All right.  Thanks.  And, Pat, where are you from again?  Munaki, New Jersey.  That's right, Munaki.  New Jersey.  And then we got Matt. 
[02:19:30]  What's up, Matt?  What's going on?  Where are you from, bro?  Jersey.  More Jersey, guys.  Jersey, just supporting the show.  Jersey represent.  Wow, big time.  Any shout-outs, anything you want to say before the contest begins?  Just if you've got a Dodge truck, like to work on it, check out RamChargerCentral.com.  It's a good message board.  Yeah, I'm plugging my website here.  What the hell, man?  Fine.  You should get at least five hits from that today.  All right.  You belong to a truck message board?  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Do you put in parentheses, sound of air horn?  That's quite exciting.  Driveshaft, LOL.  Do they have names like that?  No.  Like Hemi?  Sure.  I'm Hemi 102.  Hey, hi.  How you doing?  Hey, whatever.  It's just a place to go if you need help with your truck.  Oh, you sound a little taller in email. 
[02:20:30]  All right.  All right, let's move on to Joe.  Joe, where are you from?  From Queens.  Queens.  Representing Queens.  No, I can't compete with truck driving message boards.  So right now I'm thinking this is probably the worst idea I've done this morning.  How many shots do you think you could do?  Now that the guys are starting to look at the eggnog.  Yeah.  You know what?  You can see them.  I don't even.  It's the color.  It's this.  Oh.  I'm going to try to do 20, and then I might have to punch out.  Let's be honest with the color.  It's like old jizz yellow. 
[02:21:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a hepatitis load.  Hey, how do you feel about Pedro joining your match there in Queens?  See, I'm a Yankee fan, so you know what?  I'm glad we got Randy last night.  Did they really?  Well, they've still got to work on some deal through the Dodgers.  Eric Duncan, something like three minor leaguers.  Vasquez goes to L.A.  The fucking Yankees.  Can they stop giving up young talent for 50-year-old pitchers? 
[02:21:30]  Cocksucker Steinbrenner.  That really annoys me.  Thanks.  Young talent?  There you go, Joe.  Thank you, Joe.  Who else?  Go from Queens.  Do it again.  B.J.  We know B.J.  He's been around the block a few times.  Where are you from, B.J., again?  Oakdale.  Oakdale, Long Island representing Anthony.  Anything you want to say today, B.J.?  I want to say hi to Big Dave and Thundar out in Oakdale.  And everybody in whackbag.com.  And I'll plug Hugbox.net, you know, free girl porn site, you know. 
[02:22:00]  Hugbox.  You ever do any drinking down at the wharf down there?  Yeah.  Under the water?  Yeah, you used to go down there a lot when we had a boat.  This is a shithole.  I know.  It's a real shithole.  But it's a great place to go if you have a boat real close.  Yeah.  You do some drinking.  You go out on the boat.  You drink.  You come back.  Maybe slam some guy from Pennsylvania in the back of the head.  Come back.  Drink more.  It's a lot of fun.  Then you go on N.E.W. and do a radio show.  Good day, B.J.  Fabulous.  B.J.  All right, B.J., thank you.  Bang the girls from the college over there, do you? 
[02:22:30]  What college is there?  Dowling?  Dowling.  No, I don't talk to anybody from Dowling.  Nothing good there at Dowling?  No, there's a bunch of black people and Chinese people.  Black people and Chinese people?  Yeah, we don't, like, talk to them much.  Good boy.  If they're not stealing, they're staring blank with no expression on their face.  Gotta love Oakdale.  Thank you, B.J.  All right.  You're welcome.  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Where are you from, bud?  I'm from Connecticut.  Connecticut representing.  Yeah.  And what do you want to say today?  I don't want to say hello to the guys at opianthony.net. 
[02:23:00]  I'm on there as Grizzly.  Also, thank my sister for coming down.  Moral support today.  She's out.  I thought she was going to be in the contest.  We were hoping one of these girls were going to be in the contest today.  Well, she really doesn't like eggnog.  Who does, though?  I know.  Yeah, I do.  Oh, we were going to have a little bite-size fruitcake here.  Oh, right.  We forgot about that.  A little awful fruitcake.  I see it's Land O'Lakes eggnog.  Yeah.  The same company that makes the butter.  So it's all creamy, buttery, I'm sure, also.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm ready. 
[02:23:30]  And you guys, make sure you don't puke on us, please.  You guys all look around and see where the garbage pails are.  We should have made the meat.  Do our best.  Eggnog and some sort of meat.  Some sort of meat?  A little cube of meat.  Like pork?  Yeah.  Okay.  That wouldn't be closer.  That's for Joe Rogan giving out 50 grand.  No thanks.  All right.  Let's move on to Steve over there, who's wearing one of my brother's fine T-shirts, I noticed.  Oh.  Of course.  Turn around, man.  Last month, I got a sign on the back by the artist today.  Oh, right on.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  My brother's What's In Your Pants T-shirts. 
[02:24:00]  Fine T-shirts.  Very cool.  You're not allowed to stay from Brooklyn.  All right.  You can email Dr. Duckhasm.  Dr. Duckhasm?  Dr. D-U-K at AOL.com if you want one of these fine Opie Anthony What's In Your Pants T-shirts.  Shameless plug.  Shameless plug.  Speaking of shameless plugs, eatable.com.  Thank you, mister.  Oh, look at you, Steve.  Anything else you want to say?  Downtown, December 23rd, next Thursday.  Oh, by the way, Nathaniel will also be performing there with me.  Our intern will be doing some.  Yeah, Norton at the downtown.  Throwing the kid a bone.  Nah, he's funny. 
[02:24:30]  Who's breathing like Darth Vader?  Is that you?  Yeah, what's wrong, Steve?  Wow.  Nothing's a little hot in here.  I thought we were on the Death Star.  It's really hot in here.  It's hot so you have emphysema?  It really is hot in here, which is going to make this contest even worse.  Oh, even better.  Oh, man, the eggnog is starting to boil a little bit.  Oh, by the second, it's just getting hotter and hotter.  It's starting to get a little clumpy, I noticed, Anthony.  Oh.  All right, Ellis, we talked, he had his stomach done, so he's just not going to last.  Who is he kidding? 
[02:25:00]  I'd like to dedicate winning this my fight to my surgeon, who helped me lose 140 pounds.  All right.  There you go.  All right, there you go.  If I don't pass out first.  Okay.  And then, finally, Doug, we talked to Doug earlier, too.  He's from Arizona.  He flew in just for the contest, Anthony.  Dedication.  Anything you want to say, Doug?  Uh, go Sun Devils in the Sun Bowl.  Fuck Purdue.  Fuck Purdue.  All right.  There you go.  All right, Doug.  Fuck a chicken.  All right, I think we're ready.  Do you want to give the rules, Anthony?  They're pretty simple, I guess.  The rules are simple.  Our contestants will do one of these glasses full of creamy eggnog every minute. 
[02:25:30]  Every minute.  If you puke, out and see.  If you have to take a leak, whether it's in your pants or you actually leave and go to the bathroom,  OOT!  You're OOT!  The last guy left that has not puked or pissed himself is the winner of the MiFi.  That is how we play the game.  You all understand? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Very good.  You guys all know what cup you're going for?  I guess the cups are numbered, Dan?  Yeah, we will not be doing a Le Mans start where they run to their cups.  And you guys all know where the garbage pails are, right?  Sadly, right behind me.  Yes, please, more important than an exit in a building on fire, please take note.  Please take note of the pails.  Just pick up whichever cup you want.  You're going to have to hold it the whole time.  Wait, one question.  Do we have to kind of like slam them or can we take the whole minute to drink? 
[02:26:30]  You have a minute.  What do you want?  You will have a whole minute.  You can strategically use that minute however you want if you want to do it slow.  But then just remember, the next one's right around the corner.  Some guys that want to chug it can then use the rest of the minute to relax and maybe...  Get that down.  Guys, here's the deal, too.  We've got two sets of cups here because they're pouring as you're drinking, all right?  So just try to go for the...  Well, whatever.  Just grab one.  Can I make a holiday toast for the first shot?  Sure, Kenny.  All right, Kenny.  Good one, Kenny.  Let's everyone raise their glass to our hosts, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:27:00]  Because, and of course, little Jim, who I love dear.  Now, don't drink until you hear the bell because we want it on one of the secondhand on the 12th.  We're going to go right at the 12th, Kenny, so go.  Go with your toast.  You've got five seconds.  But without Opie and Anthony, this would not be made possible.  So here we go.  Cheers.  Cheers.  And there's the first one.  The contest has begun, Anthony.  It has begun.  Every time that secondhand sweeps to the 12th.  All right.  No, you don't have to drink it right away. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, hold your...  You should hold the glasses.  Oh, they're just going to be doing it.  Hold on.  No, no.  Yeah, but then we won't be able to keep track.  It's got to be every minute.  Hold on, hold on.  Every minute, guys.  Every minute.  Every minute.  They're already wrecking the contest.  You do one a minute.  You can't start chugging them all down.  I like that enthusiasm, though.  I like that, too.  All right.  Everyone did their first shot of eggnog, right?  What did it taste like?  And that guy...  It tasted like the squid bucket from Bob Murphy.  And that guy, fill up Steve's cup.  He screwed up.  He's officially on the clock for drinking only one eggnog. 
[02:28:00]  Right.  He decided to get cocky, Anthony, and do two right away.  Opie, if this comes down to one eggnog and he's in it, and it worked out that that extra  shot he did puts him over the top, I'm sure we'll have a disappointed lad.  All right.  The cups are all filled.  Wow.  And look how quickly this comes about.  Wow.  That is quick.  All right.  Two, one.  And here goes the second round.  Second round.  Eggnog drinking motherfuckers.  Goes down as easy as the first.  I see BJ's taking that slower drinking of the eggnog. 
[02:28:30]  Doug from Arizona is having a little problem there.  I see it in his face.  What's going on, Doug?  Strategy.  Do we have a mic over there?  I'm six.  Strategy.  Strategy.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Slow and steady wins the race.  All right.  So, Anthony, everyone finish their second?  Everyone finish their second.  John automatically grabbed his third, and he's holding it there.  Eager beaver.  Ellis, what's going on with that little stomach of yours?  No problem.  Not a problem at all.  He's got a nog mustache going on himself there. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  Looks like he just got a ride from an older gentleman.  Jesus.  All right, Anthony, we're getting close to the third round.  Everyone's got their eggnog in their hands, waiting for the start of the third round here.  Amazing how quickly that minute goes by, isn't it?  Wow.  A little too quick, right?  It's here already.  I'm thinking after five or so, you're going to start seeing a bit of a change.  There goes the third round.  People's attitudes.  I'm looking around the room.  Dice is doing okay in the corner there.  Joe is the first to finish there. 
[02:29:30]  BJ's, everyone's down.  How's everyone feeling?  Still confident?  Still confident.  Wow.  Yeah, Joe, what's going on?  It's starting to weigh Joe down a little bit.  What?  What's going on, Joe?  You don't look too good already.  Yeah, I said it's starting to weigh me down like Connor and Lacey.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Ben, anything else?  Any other observations?  All right, Anthony, the third round is done by everybody.  We're filling up the cups for the fourth round.  Is anyone starting to think, wow, I might not be able to do this after just three? 
[02:30:00]  No.  Anyone?  No?  How about you, Steve?  You're on your ninth.  I'm fine.  Good to go.  Good to go?  Good to go, Jim.  All right.  Any trash talking?  Nothing?  You guys are?  I think Dice over there is starting to puss out, man.  Oh, wow.  Puss out.  No.  I got moved over by the Birdman.  I was fine on the other side of Pat.  All right.  Here we go.  If I got a puke, I can climb over him.  Hit the bell for the fourth round.  Here we go.  This is the fourth double shot of eggnog.  It really does come around quickly.  Oh, it sure does.  All right.  Joe slammed his cup down. 
[02:30:30]  There they go.  I got a puke.  Doug from Arizona.  Pat, how are you holding up over there?  The big guy, Pat?  Tastes like pancake batter.  Tastes like pancake batter.  Warm pancake batter, Anthony.  And why would you know what pancake batter tastes like?  Ooh.  Ooh, a little trash.  I like it.  All right.  Nice punch in the stomach after a bunch of eggnog.  Let me find out what's in my pants.  A good horse foot to the stomach.  Anthony.  Another carton done.  Ellis, you were a little slow there.  You all right?  I'm just pacing myself. 
[02:31:00]  He's the guy with the small stomach.  Yeah.  He's not going to last too much longer.  I got a minute to drink this thing, you said.  Yeah, you're right.  Hold on.  We're getting ready for the fifth shot.  Wait for the bell.  Wow.  Go ahead, Raisin.  You already got four double shots in him, Anthony.  How could that little stomach hold that?  It won't.  It really won't.  Yeah.  We are coming around again.  Another minute is complete.  And there you go.  This is the fifth double shot of eggnog.  Let's look and see.  It's not going down as fast with a couple of people.  Joe's got, I don't know, your eyes are tearing a little bit or something's going on there. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got a little redder in the face, a little hotter in here.  Anyone else have something to say?  Just raise your hand and Eric will give you the mic.  Ellis is sipping it like it's a Manhattan.  Ellis has a minute.  Ellis is the one with the small stomach.  I got a minute.  I got another 30 seconds before I got to finish this one.  Yes, you do.  Then the next one will start immediately.  Anybody else?  Anyone else?  When did a small stomach become equal to you to a pussy exactly?  You were talking shit outside.  Like, oh, I can do this.  I wasn't the one out there blowing a midget to stay warm. 
[02:32:00]  Oh.  Wow.  Hey, wow.  I don't know what that means, but whatever it is.  Ellis just finished.  I'll leave it on that one.  I got nothing.  All right.  15 seconds left.  All right.  Ellis finishes up.  Five shots done already, right?  Five shots were on?  Yeah.  Somebody's got to keep tabs with us.  This is the sixth round coming up in about five seconds.  Shot number six?  I think they're going to get to the 10 easily, and then it's going to get interesting.  Anthony, yeah.  Get ready.  There we go, guys.  Sixth round has begun.  Sixth round of eggnog.  And Joe is the one who's finishing consistently first. 
[02:32:30]  Got to get him down quick and then rest for 40 seconds, I guess.  That would seem to be the good strategy.  I think the guys that are nursing it for the whole minute, a little more pressures on these  guys.  Has everyone finished?  Even Ellis slammed that one.  Okay.  Anyone feeling anything?  Just stepping up, man.  I'm feeling good, man.  I'm good.  Everyone's good so far.  It's coming out of Ellis' nose and ears now, though.  That could be a problem.  Yeah.  Ellis is leaking eggnog a little bit.  Uh-oh.  All right.  They're filling up the cups, Anthony.  The seventh round is on its way. 
[02:33:00]  Damn.  Pat, how are you?  One pussy coming.  All of a sudden, you're slamming them with the rest of us now.  Hey, what do you want me to say, man?  Ooh.  Wow.  There's a rivalry.  How about I drink yours, too?  I don't think I'm going to be able to handle it.  I don't know.  Side wager?  Dice and Ellis are going at it, Anthony.  There's a problem there between these two.  All right.  On the bell, guys.  The seventh round of eggnog will begin.  There's another minute.  Gone.  Jesus.  A minute goes quick.  I'm looking around the room.  Another round.  Pat is done.  Dice is done.  Matt's done.  Joe's done. 
[02:33:30]  BJ's done.  John's done.  Steve's done.  No, Steve's still sipping.  Okay.  Now Steve's done.  Ellis is done.  And Doug.  Doug, how are you feeling from Arizona?  Fantastic.  You?  I don't have to drink this crap.  I'm doing all right.  It's not affecting him yet.  No.  You think it's going to be a little higher than we anticipated, Opie?  I don't know.  Nah.  No.  Or you think it'll kick in?  No.  BJ's already shaking his head.  No way.  You think it's going to kick in, like, quickly, where it's going to turn around?  It's going to hit you.  Absolutely.  BJ is the smallest contestant.  I think he's in risk of getting out very early in the competition. 
[02:34:00]  Smallest contestant in this batch doesn't mean you're small either.  Believe me.  If I'm the first one out before Ellis, that really sucks.  You don't want to lose to Ellis.  I'm kind of scared.  I'm beginning to smell like a puke smell coming from this dude right here.  Remember the little chick that always wins the Nathan Hot Dog Contest?  Yeah.  That's true.  I guess.  You know.  All right.  Thank you, Club Soda Kenny.  Brilliant.  As always.  There it is.  Take him down, guys.  Here comes the eighth round, Anthony.  Eighth round.  This is eight double shots of eggnog.  Most of the guys having no problem still. 
[02:34:30]  Joe making a lot of faces, though.  Yeah, there was like a chunk of I don't know what in that one.  Well, the eggnog's getting clumpier.  It's been warming up all morning.  Yeah.  Now, eight of these two-ounce shots would make it 16 ounces.  That's right.  Anyone feeling anything they want to talk about?  Anyone?  Anyone?  You guys all good still?  There's another carton gone.  You all right?  Did anybody get the stalker patty pubes? 
[02:35:00]  No, that was a toenail.  No one's having any problems.  Joe, you look like you're having problems.  No, I'm good.  I'm good.  Maybe it's strategy.  Maybe he's playing possum, Anthony.  Playing possum.  Like poker.  That's true.  All right.  He could lay back, make people think he's injured.  Ellis, you all right?  Good, man.  With the small stomach?  Okay.  I cannot possibly see how he's doing that.  All right.  Here we go.  We're just putting around, and there it is.  And we're up to the ninth round of eggnog.  I'm trying to get a line on how they're feeling by the way they drink these down. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Steve's taking his slow approach or slower approach.  Ellis kind of having a little more trouble washing this one down?  No?  No, it's just the taste.  He's making a milk.  It's just the taste.  It's kind of snotty.  Well, maybe not the taste.  The consistency is kind of like a viscous, you know?  Yes.  Very thick.  Smooth.  Very thick and viscous.  Yeah.  Like grease and oil.  Yeah.  All right.  Ellis is the only one.  Oh, Ellis and Steve.  They're starting to slow down a little bit.  Yep.  Steve, you all right?  I'm all right.  I'm fine.  All right.  Steve finished up his ninth.  He's fine.  And the cups get refilled. 
[02:36:00]  Double shot of eggnog.  Ellis, you're done?  I'm done.  Okay.  Ellis is done, too.  These guys are all East Coast drunks.  You're not going to get anybody puking on 10.  It's going to be a little while before these guys puking.  Yeah, but it's a lot different than being out drinking some real fun booze.  This is thick, creamy, nauseating.  Heavy.  Heavy.  Did I say thick?  Yes, you did.  And creamy.  There it is.  Number 10.  Here goes number 10.  We thought we'd be seeing a reaction by 10.  Looking around the room, Anthony, Pat's done.  Dice is done.  Matt's done. 
[02:36:30]  Joe's done.  Wow.  BJ's slowing down a little bit, but he just completed.  John.  And, of course, Steve and Ellis taking their time once again.  Steve taking their time.  And Doug from Arizona having no problem so far.  Ellis is starting to swish it around in his mouth, like, hold it in his mouth a little  bit.  That's not a good sign.  I think I found my talent.  Yeah.  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  Well, there's a resume stuffer.  That's a good one.  Pat's definitely the one to beat right here.  He has the eye of the tiger.  Yeah, definitely.  He's enjoying it.  It's like the eye of the tiger and the stomach of a rhino.  Do I mention my diabetes?  I mention my diabetes. 
[02:37:00]  What an ass.  And, John, I saw you shaking your head like you were shaking off a punch after that last  cup.  I was just letting it all drip down the gullet a little bit.  You ever see a boxer get hit and he kind of goes, you know, shakes it off?  I saw him doing that.  Yeah, it's getting a little more interesting.  A little bit.  I think we're going to get to 20, no problem, and then it's going to just get any.  It won't be no problem.  We're on 10 now.  There it is.  This is the 11th round, Anthony.  That's all the eggnog we got?  John looks like Brother Joe with Down Syndrome.  Are we going to run out of eggnog? 
[02:37:30]  If we're going to run out of eggnog, someone better go get some now.  Like pronto.  That would ruin the contest.  We only have two.  Six.  We only have six.  How many have we been through?  Three gallons.  I'm not sure how many we've been through yet.  There's four.  There's four.  Where can we get eggnog?  Somebody better go right now.  Oh, my God.  Just in case.  Underestimation of the eggnog supply.  Just in case.  Perhaps.  All right, Anthony.  This is the 11th round.  How's everyone doing?  I was studying the eggnog in the cooler. 
[02:38:00]  Very good.  I like how you jumped on that, though, Opie.  You saw maybe a dilemma developing.  I saw Nathaniel to my left panicking going, we're going through this very fast.  Yeah.  I'll be bringing in a different one.  If we switch brands of eggnog, is that going to affect people?  No.  Hey.  All right.  Everyone get their 11th round down?  Steve is slowing way down, dude.  Wow, Steve.  I haven't even finished it.  Steve, you might be out.  Steve, did you finish?  Drink, drink.  No?  Is he out?  I don't know if we made that one of our rules, did we?  Well, you have a minute to drink every round. 
[02:38:30]  He's got to finish this up.  All right.  From now on, if you don't finish by the time the next round starts, you're out.  Steve barely made it.  I don't think we made that clear.  All right.  So now we're up to the 12th round, Anthony.  I know.  Steve is sounding like Frankie Blue.  No problem, baby.  And there's no alcohol in this eggnog, but it affects you the same way.  Steve, you had a problem with that last cup.  Please let us know what's going on.  I'm not drinking this one.  Eric, get over there.  Steve, get out.  Yeah.  Pay attention.  I'm all right.  You're all right?  Well, you have 25 seconds to finish that one up.  Get it down. 
[02:39:00]  Get that thick beverage down.  That thick, heavy beverage.  Uh-oh.  Now he's lying.  Uh-oh.  Has everyone else finished?  Swallow that thick beverage.  15 seconds, Steve.  Everyone else finished, right?  Filled with sugar.  You can do it.  10 seconds, Steve.  Steve.  Come on, Steve.  Five seconds, Steve.  Wash it down.  Oh, he's still in, but barely.  He's all right.  And pick up another one, Steve.  Is Ellis out?  I can't take any more down.  A small stomach Ellis is out, Anthony.  Ellis is out.  Let's say goodbye to Ellis. 
[02:39:30]  Thank you, Ellis.  Hey, he's great coming up here.  He was the long shot in this contest with his little pea stomach.  So, uh, good luck.  Our first contestant is out.  He couldn't handle any more eggnog.  Now beat it, Raisin Belly.  We're in the middle of the 13th round, Anthony.  I'm on my way, too, guys.  Huh?  What?  I'm on my way, too.  Go ahead, Steve.  Oh, come on, Steve.  Chug it.  Come on.  We've got 30 seconds left.  Come on, Steve.  Come on.  Take it like it's the load of an uncle.  Yeah, we don't want you bowing out without finishing.  You've got to at least give it a shot.  We want to see some puking, man.  He didn't get a puke.  He'll be fine.  All right, you've got 20 seconds. 
[02:40:00]  Everyone else finished their round, right?  Come on.  All right, here goes Steve.  Come on.  Take that cup of liquid snot.  Oh, Jesus.  Thick.  Come on, Steve.  Give it a shot.  Thick and creamy.  Come on, Steve.  10 seconds to get the 13th shot of eggnog down.  Uh-oh.  He's having some trouble.  Come on, Steve.  Five seconds.  Four.  Three.  Three.  Two.  He can't do it.  He's out.  He is out.  And the 14th round started.  There it is.  Anthony.  Now, Steve, you've got to spin it in a circle. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, guys, for letting me come on.  Thank you, Steve.  There he goes.  We'll see you after the contest, but we just want to clear the studio out.  Oh.  Oh, burned.  Anthony, this is for the MuFi.  Burned.  We're down to eight contestants.  We're in the 14th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  What's going on?  We lost two in a row.  What's going on?  We lost two in a row.  Everyone else, I've been concentrating on those two that have just been knocked out of the competition.  Haven't really given any attention to the other guys.  How are we feeling?  Fine.  I think so.  Good.  Everyone else is fine.  Wait, everyone drank their 14th like nothing? 
[02:41:00]  Yep.  Wow, we're just sitting here waiting for the 15th round to start.  It doesn't affect you guys?  The two guys are out now?  They don't care.  It's good.  It motivates us.  It motivates you.  It doesn't make you think, wow, a few more shots and it's going to get ugly here.  That too.  All right.  Wow, there's a cheering section outside of the window holding up signs now.  Great.  I got fans.  Big boys.  And the 15th round starts.  Go, Pat.  And then another sign, hope you puke.  That looks good.  Pat, we have seven contestants? 
[02:41:30]  I don't know.  Didn't we start with 10?  We started with nine.  Oh, we started with nine.  Okay.  I don't know, Opie.  All right.  Let's just start thinking of boss's ear.  What?  Oh, we had a spot for the guy from Maine.  All right.  This is the 15th round, Anthony.  Seems the eggnog is draining any humor that might have been in these guys.  Jesus.  Dice, how are you feeling over there?  Feeling fine.  Feeling fine.  Okay.  Pat, you all right?  Piece of cake?  I don't even notice it yet.  Uh-oh.  We'll go a couple more hours. 
[02:42:00]  A couple more hours.  All right.  Yeah, you can.  Everyone got their fifth.  B.J. is still in the contest, Ant.  B.J., yeah.  He was thought to have been one of the long shots.  But he's standing too stiff.  B.J. is not happy right now.  He's standing too relaxed.  He really wants to vomit.  I was surprised to see Steve out so early.  Yeah?  Yeah, he's a big guy.  I thought he was going to do good.  I knew that an old change purse stomach was going to have trouble, but we're up to  the 16th round of the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:42:30]  John slammed his.  Doug from Arizona slammed his.  Going around the room, everyone's still having no problem.  John, how are you feeling?  You're rubbing your belly.  You're rubbing your belly.  Just massaging it in there.  All right.  It's good.  I'm getting close, I think.  I hope not.  B.J. is getting close.  Now, what makes you think you're getting close?  I want to know what the feeling is.  I don't know.  Bloat?  Kind of, yeah.  Yeah, but the thing is, like, the other two, they just quit. 
[02:43:00]  I'm going to keep drinking until I puke my brain.  That's what we want to hear today.  Somebody just shit their pants.  I don't know if that's strategy or something, but it is horrific.  It wasn't a fart over there.  Who the F farted?  Kenny, is it you?  That was my big announcement.  All right.  Well, Anthony, it stinks in the studio.  There it goes.  There it is, guys.  Another one.  17th round in the eggnog drinking contest.  17.  And John just slamming it.  Pat slammed his. 
[02:43:30]  Doug from Arizona.  A little slow, but he got down.  A little slower than before.  And B.J. still in the competition.  Everyone done?  John?  Hooray.  Who's Joe or eggnog?  They better hurry up.  No.  How are we doing on eggnog supply?  How many left?  Three over there.  How many over there?  How many over there?  We should be all right.  For now.  Two left over here.  They're going to buy too many now.  They're going to bring back 30.  Oh, we're going to have like 800 things of eggnog over here.  Guys, any math?  How are you doing? 
[02:44:00]  It's filling up, but it's making a little more room.  Making a little more room.  Oh, my God.  I like his flaming shirt.  I like Steve.  B.J. is closing his eyes, Anthony, and concentrating.  Is it a concentrating move, or is it like I'm going to puke move?  It's a concentrating move, trying to ignore that little sharp pain in my stomach right  now.  And 18.  There we go.  It's going to be a little hard to ignore when you're drinking a little more.  Here we go.  The 18th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat's just slamming up. 
[02:44:30]  Wow.  Pat's unbeatable.  What does Dice have to say about that, though?  Dice?  I think it's me and Pat at the end.  Really?  You're having no problem?  Dice and Pat having no problem?  I'm a long-eyed alky.  What do you expect?  Matt having a little bit of a problem.  Joe just making a lot of faces.  I don't know what that means, Anthony.  But he seems to be putting it down okay.  BJ?  I got a few more rounds left in me, and if he doesn't show any cracks, it's his.  No, no.  You got it.  I mean, we need to see some puke, man.  You got to take one for the team.  BJ?  His stomach's pretty full.  Oh, you're fine, BJ. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, he's...  Sure.  Wait, did you finish your last one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And so everyone finished it.  18th round is done.  Doug, how are you feeling over there from Arizona?  I'm going until I vomit.  All right.  It's the Arizona spirit.  Who's cheating?  Who's cheating?  I was figuring it out quick.  You were what?  Grab number nine.  Fuck it.  Go with nine.  Oh, they're mixing up each other.  All right, here we go.  19th round has begun.  You could be drinking somebody else's backwash.  In the eggnog drinking contest.  Someone is...  The notes are going up on the window.  Do it for Connor, BJ. 
[02:45:30]  There's a hope you puke on the window, and big boys rule, go Pat.  I think...  BJ's ready to puke.  Eric was a little alarmed that Joe was having a problem.  Did he gag a little?  It was a little...  A little reflex.  A little...  A little trouble getting that one down, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Well, you have 30 seconds.  BJ's going to puke soon.  This may be it, this one.  Nah, you'll be fine, BJ.  Come on, BJ.  Well, he got that down, right?  BJ's face is looking a little different than earlier. 
[02:46:00]  That festive, I'm here having fun look, gone from his face.  It's been replaced by a, holy shit, I'm going to vomit look.  That determined, I will not puke.  You know that look you get when you're fucked up and you know you're going to vomit?  I'm not going to puke, man.  Not this time.  You're fine, dude.  You're fine.  I just got to get through my radio shift.  Kenny.  Baby.  And 20th round has begun in the eggnog drinking contest.  Kenny, you can let the girls and stuff in.  We have more room in the studio.  Yeah.  More eggnog, please.  Oh, wow. 
[02:46:30]  Uh-oh, BJ.  BJ, you're fine.  Take it down.  All eyes are on BJ.  Oh, his glasses are coming off.  He took his glasses off.  Uh-oh.  He doesn't want them falling in.  He doesn't want them falling in the, in the, in the, in the fell as he pukes.  Come on, BJ.  Come on, BJ.  Plenty of time, BJ.  BJ.  BJ.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Should I finish this so I can puke more?  Yeah, you can.  Go ahead, BJ. 
[02:47:00]  Sure, you got 20 seconds.  Everyone else finished the 20th round.  BJ, we're going to have to say goodbye to BJ.  Like a champ, he's finishing up the 20th.  Oh, wow.  What a fucking good sport he is.  What a good egg.  What a trooper, man.  Let's hear it for BJ.  Whackbag.com.  Whackbag.com, yes.  Our first vomit release.  That was a pretty puke.  That was a good one.  Here it is.  Uh-oh, Joe.  You drank it down, right, Joe?  You're all right.  Joe just drank it down.  He's holding the edges of the bucket and leaning over a little and bouncing. 
[02:47:30]  Was that his 20th or the 21st?  That was 20th.  Whatever we're up to.  Oh, that was fine.  Oh, so Joe still has to do the 21st.  No, no.  Joe just did the 21st.  No, that was fine.  He sucked that one right down.  Oh, okay.  You can't make him spin in a circle after every shot.  How nice of that.  Whoa.  All right.  We're down.  BJ's still puking out there.  Is he?  Oh, he's going, oh, that was cool.  Thank you, Club Soda County.  All right.  What did Jimmy Norton just do?  Did you get that on tape?  I went to look out the window, and I fucking forgot that the glass comes in. 
[02:48:00]  I just smashed my head on it.  It's double-paned with about a foot and a half in between.  And he thought it was the far window, so he went to look out it and smashed his head.  Did he puke?  Yes, he did.  Did you puke?  Yeah.  I sunk him out.  Oh, Joe is out.  Joe is out.  And we're ready to drink more.  Punch out, Margaret.  Wow.  Joe puked.  All right.  Joe puked.  The 22nd round of the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, no.  Why don't we move the contestants into the center so we know who's who now?  We got Doug from Arizona.  We got John still in the contest.  We got Matt, Dice, and Pat.  Wow.  We're down to the last five, Anthony.  We have had two puking losses.  That's a good sign for me.  This is for the MiFi, the portable XM satellite radio.  The wall.  Shane, ring us on.  Which one?  The shit dicks are behind you, Dice.  Yeah.  All right.  It's classic.  They're putting up signs as the contest continues.  Look at that smudge your head left on the window, Jim.  I know.  It's a little grease mark. 
[02:49:00]  That big spot on the window where you clocked your head.  Eric, everyone get their 20-second shot down?  Yep.  Okay.  Yep.  We're coming up on, what, 10 seconds left before the next one.  Nope.  They're all right.  Two people out by puking.  Two more out by just saying they've had it.  And we have five seconds left before the next shot, guys.  Here it comes.  And we're up to the 23rd round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Pat putting that one down like he put down his first, Opie.  My brother's very impressed with Pat. 
[02:49:30]  I'm getting a good whip for a puke in a garbage can.  How is it?  It's great.  It's beautiful.  Uh-oh.  Nice and creamy.  Doug from Arizona having a little problem.  He came a long way, Anthony.  Is this it for Doug?  Think of all the egg yolks.  We're going to have to eat oatmeal for a week to get our cholesterol back down.  Wait a month.  You're talking shit when you bring up cholesterol.  Wait, what, what, Dice?  Who brings up cholesterol when they're trying to talk shit?  That's a good point.  It's like, oh, go have a piece of bacon.  Your cholesterol will get higher today.  That was just fucking stupid. 
[02:50:00]  Doug is just sipping, Anthony.  I don't think he's going to make it.  No, he's not going to make it.  Come on, Doug.  We've got 15 seconds left, Doug.  Doug said he'll drink until he pukes.  Doug from Arizona is still in, Anthony.  What a trooper.  He's still in.  Drinking like one of those Arizona Indians.  They prefer Native Americans.  Wait, is everyone in?  Matt and I make this one.  Matt's got, no.  Matt's fine.  That's right, drink it down.  Wait, is he one behind?  No.  Oh, okay.  I thought he was behind. 
[02:50:30]  All right, so this is the 24th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  How are you feeling?  And Matt looks like he's filling up.  It's good between Doug and Matt to be out next, I think.  Doug has a full cup left.  It's been 20 seconds.  Come on, Doug.  You can do it.  To this round, he hasn't taken a sip.  There's his first sip.  Doug, you flew all the way from Arizona on JetBlue, man.  Think about the motion of that plane.  Turbulence.  30 seconds, Doug.  25 seconds, Doug.  The smell of a bad pussy.  He is trying, man. 
[02:51:00]  Watch his ear get.  A little rough.  Someone's scraping their tongue and holding it under your nose.  He's 15 seconds.  15 seconds, Anthony.  He's finding.  There's the end of the beat.  Just suck it.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that was as close as you could come to puking.  You've got five seconds, my friend.  Come on, Doug.  Five seconds.  Come on.  Slam it.  Slam it.  Slam it.  Slam it down.  You got it.  Yeah, he just made it, Anthony.  There he is.  Just made it.  And just in time to do another.  The 25th round. 
[02:51:30]  Oh!  A lot of puking.  Matt has puked.  Matt is out.  He's shaking like a dog and it's flying everywhere.  Matt is out.  Matt is out of the contest.  Just couldn't do it.  Wow.  Couldn't do it.  Let's hear it for Matt.  My suggestion for the next contest is get a wider garbage game.  Man, his puke went kind of flying all over the place.  Oh, my God.  It was like a scene out of Turner and Hooch.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  He's shaking his head and vomits flying. 
[02:52:00]  Uh-oh.  Doug's got a problem again, Anthony.  Doug's got 20 seconds left and he's got almost a full cup there.  Come on, Doug.  You flew in for a drink.  Wait.  And I'm also noticing Dice doesn't have a...  All right.  He's getting it down.  No, Dice went...  10 seconds left.  Yeah, Dice went with some strategy.  Wait until the last minute.  Oh, Doug is bowing out.  Doug, you're bowing out with that puking.  Oh, and that's it.  That's it.  We got a gag out of Doug.  Dice is having problems.  He's having problems.  Dice is having problems now.  Please.  I think Matt puking right next to Dice was a little bit of a problem for Dice. 
[02:52:30]  All right.  We got Dice, Pat, and John left in the contest.  There's only three guys left.  Dice, you got 45 seconds and a full glass.  You haven't touched it yet.  What are you thinking?  Absolutely nothing.  All right.  He's having some trouble.  No, he's fine.  He's fine.  Uh-oh.  Wait.  Is he putting it down?  Yep.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Why don't you at least hold your cup so you can finish it if you feel the urge?  Dice, you have 25 seconds left.  I don't know.  It's for the my five. 
[02:53:00]  Everyone is moving away from Dice.  Come on, Dice.  You just got to wolf it.  Here he goes.  Just shoot that down.  Dice.  It's not going to get you sick.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice.  Dice is still in, Anthony.  You finished it.  Nice.  It's Pat, Dice, and John.  You finished, John?  I haven't heard that chant for 10 years.  And big.  There's another.  Pat washing it right down.  Oh!  Was that a puke?  Oh, yes, it was. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  It was a power boot.  God damn.  Dice is out in the 27th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Dice.  Good job, though.  Wow.  Let's hear it for Dice.  I'm going to bow out gracefully.  We are extreme.com.  Very good.  There he goes.  Dice.  Made a great effort, Anthony.  It is down to John and Pat.  John and Pat have done their shots already?  They both get a garbage pail.  The first guy to puke loses, obviously, and the other guy gets the MiFi.  We're just down to these two.  The portal X on satellite radio.  This is it. 
[02:54:00]  Wow.  Here we go.  Guys, how are you both feeling?  Good enough?  Were you confident that you can win this?  I'm winning.  And Pat?  I'm fine.  Pat is fine.  That's totally fine.  That's a big fuck, man.  Pat came in second place on our last The Cherry Darts competition.  Just missed winning a MiFi.  This time, I mean, he's hell-bent.  But come back.  He is confident he's winning this.  And ding.  28th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Straight cycle arms.  Pat just knocks it right back.  John, Pat.  Very quick second.  Pat. 
[02:54:30]  More eggnog.  Yay.  We don't need that much.  That's all right.  We had to make sure.  We don't need that much, Danny.  That's funny.  Danny, we didn't need more eggnog.  John, you got it down, right?  Thank you.  All right.  They both got it down.  It's all down.  They have their next shot in their hands already.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Interesting.  How many more shots do you guys think you could do?  How many you got?  Pat's feeling no ill effects from this whatsoever.  It might be striking.  Just another day for me.  John, are you feeling any ill effects?  I'm definitely feeling it.  You're feeling it?  But I can keep going.  I think he's playing possum. 
[02:55:00]  He's hurting.  You think he's hurting a little bit?  He's hurting.  All right.  And John, where are you from again?  Connecticut.  Connecticut.  And Pat's from?  Munaki.  Munaki.  Jersey and Connecticut.  Jersey.  I got diabetes, but I got nine more toes.  Oh, wow.  That wasn't bad, though.  I like him.  He takes a lot of practice swings.  And, guys, look what time it is.  29.  This is how many shots Jim from PA, who's on the phone, thought the winner would do without  puking, by the way.  Wow.  Pat knocks it right back. 
[02:55:30]  John, a little slower drinking than Pat.  Yeah.  Not as big.  It's like a two-gulp thing.  Three, maybe.  And then Pat just knocks this back like it's nothing.  I have not yet begun to drink.  Wow.  All right.  What was that?  29.  That was 29.  That was 29.  We're coming up on our 30th shot.  That is 60 ounces of creamy, thick, viscous, land-o-lakes eggnog.  When Pat's walking down the street, people just point at him and say, there's Pat. 
[02:56:00]  The best there's ever been.  Oh, great.  All right.  We're just kind of waiting.  Pat letting off a little steam.  From Mount Vesuvius.  And John has a posture to him that looks a little uncomfortable.  Yeah, he's not moving.  As we start the 30th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  30 double shots of eggnog, Anthony.  Two gulps for Pat.  I'm in the mood for some eggnog. 
[02:56:30]  Thank you.  He just takes that other cup.  What a day to you, sir.  You know, it really makes you appreciate the athleticism of these two when you see how easily the others were knocked out.  That's the difference between the people that came and might have thought they had a chance and the true champions in eggnog drinking, Opie.  I'm really amazed that these guys are so above and beyond the guys that have been counted out.  Pat? 
[02:57:00]  And I didn't think I'd accomplish anything in life but this.  John?  All right.  Oh, man.  John, I'm rooting for you.  I'm getting there.  Don't let this big fuck beat you.  I'm not done yet.  I'm not done yet.  Not done.  Here we go, Anthony.  We're just about ready for the 31st round of the eggnog drinking contest.  You know, I like Pat, but I would like him to be the Susan Lucci of my fives, you know?  Where he's always in it but just can't seem to pull it off kind of thing. 
[02:57:30]  They both got it down pretty easily.  The Buffalo Bills of my fives.  A lot of burping going on.  Size 14.  Size 14.  Size 14.  We haven't played that in a while.  Need some help, would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Pat?  I got nothing.  It puts the eggnog in its belly.  Does this every minute.  She spilled my eggnog.  This is like the lull before the storm, Anthony.  They're just piling up, aren't they? 
[02:58:00]  Oh, it's the Autobahn in the fog.  All right.  Oh, God.  John, head tilted slightly askew.  He's bent over a little.  Is it hard for you to stand up completely straight now?  I think Pat has him psyched out.  He might.  All right.  There it is.  The 32nd round in the eggnog drinking contest.  Aaron from Texas.  This is what he thought the winner would do without puking.  By the way.  Wow. 
[02:58:30]  And right in the hand.  No problem, John?  It's getting there.  Oh, man.  It's getting there.  Percolating.  Come on, John.  It's getting there.  Hang in there, John.  Are either of you getting a nauseous feeling?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I'm just starting.  No, just starting to drink.  Right, right.  It's really a tough one.  Holy shit.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Texas real fast.  Aaron.  Yeah.  They did 32 shots, no problem. 
[02:59:00]  Yes?  Yes.  That's too many.  That's too much damn eggnog.  I know.  Well, the next guy, Jim from Illinois, can we get him on the line?  Any of these guys on the line or no?  He said that the winner would do 33 shots without puking.  It's like Steve's closet on TV.  Yeah, the big fire on the parkway.  All right, Anthony.  A little low in the action, but we're just about ready for the 33rd round of the eggnog drinking contest.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  Yummy.  That is just not even waiting. 
[02:59:30]  Pat just chugs it right.  I hate Pat.  Pat, how are you feeling?  Fine.  John?  He is built for this, John.  Yeah.  I might have to give it to him.  I don't know.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  John.  All right.  John.  No, John.  John.  John.  John.  John.  John.  Come on, John.  I finished my last one.  I could try another.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Pat has to be feeling confident.  You've got to be feeling confident, Pat.  Yes, I am.  This could be a scenario where Pat is like the Yankees and John is like the Red Sox. 
[03:00:00]  You count them out.  You think it's all over.  It looks pretty much a done deal.  Jim?  Yeah?  From Illinois.  You might be out.  They both did 33 shots.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  One more.  Come on, guys.  One more.  And here we go.  We're just about ready to start the 34th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Jared, by the way, from Maine, who hates Ben, he said the winner would do 35 shots.  He might be right on.  Maybe.  Pat, no problem once again. 
[03:00:30]  Pat, just putting it right down.  John, have it up.  Come on, John.  You have 40, 50 seconds.  You're fine.  Come on, John.  There you go.  You're fine.  There it is.  No problem, John.  John just put another one down.  It's really a little tough.  All right.  We're about to.  We're getting close to the 35th round of the eggnog drinking contest.  Jared from Maine.  What's up, Jared?  Jared, John not picking up the cup after his.  I think it's coming.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  You can do it.  Jared.  Oh, boy.  Oh! 
[03:01:00]  Hold on.  Hello.  Another volley.  Another volley of vomit.  Oh!  Another.  A third volley of vomit.  Oh, my God.  All the humanity.  Oh, my God.  Power booting.  Power booting.  Power booting.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  I am speechless.  Time for another shot.  And Pat wins and puts another one down.  More.  More.  More.  Pat. 
[03:01:30]  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  Pat.  John.  Let's hear it for John.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  And Pat's drinking another one.  Wait, how many are you up to?  Let's see how many you can do.  More.  More.  More.  How many was that?  That was two after.  Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.  This is my victory lap.  All right.  Let's just keep.  Jared, guess what?  You won the other MiFi.  We'll talk to you in a minute here.  But first, let's say hi to.  Say hi.  Let's say bye to John.  I guess.  John. 
[03:02:00]  John.  What a great effort.  Three powerful fire hose boots into that garbage pail.  It was stunning, wasn't it?  It was the first one.  Just this powerful fire hose-like nozzle spray of puke.  And then, bam, another.  And then, bam, another.  The worst part was I farted during each one.  Did you?  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Cheers, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  John.  Hopeanthony.net.  Thanks.  Hopeanthony.net.  What an effort. 
[03:02:30]  What an effort.  There he goes.  John, you represented well today, buddy.  And Pat.  Hey, John.  John.  Drinking another one.  Oh, nailed him.  Nailed him.  And there's another one with my name on it.  All right.  Now, just for the hell of it, we're going to see how many shots Pat could do here.  It's up to 38.  He might finish every single one.  39.  39.  Don't pace yourself.  Keep filling him up.  Yeah, let's just keep filling him up.  I'm a little thirsty.  Let's watch the fat guy puke.  Sorry.  I'm a little thirsty.  You've got to give him the minute, though.  You've got to give him the time, right?  Why?  Okay.  Now he's just putting him down like a madman. 
[03:03:00]  Does somebody have a blood glucose meter on him?  All right.  You can do it at your pace.  I am at my pace.  You're up to what?  40?  This is 41.  40.  He doesn't have a diabetic.  Come on now.  41.  You've got to stop.  50's a nice even number.  All right.  Let's go for 50.  We'll go for 50.  You're not really diabetic, are you?  Yeah.  Oh, God, if he loses a leg, he gets a mi-fi and a prosthetic.  We could call this the Mabel King 42.  Memorative Contest. 
[03:03:30]  There goes 42.  That was a little warm.  Uh-oh.  That's the first even hint of a complaint I've heard from Pat.  Yeah.  Could be the turning point.  I do feel my stomach going up into my ribs a little bit.  We just want to set the bar for future contests.  Yeah.  43.  Pat's the heavyweight champion.  What do you got?  This is 40 what?  43.  43 going down.  Well, you're drinking them so fast.  43 double shots of eggnog, Anthony.  Wow.  No, I know.  What are you thinking, Pat? 
[03:04:00]  It won't be accurate, but.  I'm thinking, uh, can't wait for breakfast.  All right.  Here goes 44.  44.  Yeah?  Anything?  You're looking a little different, though.  A bit peaked.  Yeah.  Well, I'm a winner now.  You won a Wi-Fi.  Yeah.  Great if he throws up on us.  Yeah.  His shorts out.  Sparks flying out of it.  Puke.  He's digging eggnog out of it.  How many is that, Eric? 
[03:04:30]  This is 45.  45 double shots of eggnog.  Scraping puke off the display.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That nice, that new smell of electronics is ruined.  You look worried.  His vile stomach.  This is 46.  46.  46.  Double shots of eggnog.  All right.  You got to get to 50.  And I can pick up your tree.  I got a nice big van.  Everything out of this guy.  47. 
[03:05:00]  47, Anthony.  47.  Oh, God.  He's done 12 since the contest ended.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Where am I at?  This is 48.  48.  48.  Two more left, and we'll just call it.  No, I think he should keep calling.  Are you kidding?  Till what?  He won't be able to go.  Till what?  It's up to.  This is 49.  Past 50.  No way.  He's got to go past 50.  Because if he pukes, then he's actually doing himself a favor.  He'll get all of it out of him. 
[03:05:30]  This is number 50.  I don't think he's going to puke.  No, he won't.  I don't think he.  It has to.  It doesn't bother him.  He's superhuman.  That's 50?  How does 50 feel?  50.  Feels like victory.  Just keep going, man.  Out of curiosity, I want to say.  51.  51.  Curiosity.  Hope he would be great in the Third Reich.  No, keep putting these spikes in his head. 
[03:06:00]  Let's see how long it takes for him to pass out.  Sew her legs together while she gives birth.  52.  52?  Pat, what do you think?  I'm slowing down.  All right.  Good.  Why?  No, you're nuts.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  He's slowing down.  No, he isn't.  He just sucked that one right down.  And I started my diet today.  Oh.  Jesus, Harry Chapin.  53. 
[03:06:30]  53.  Someone's got to figure out how many calories he's done.  Wow, yeah.  How many calories?  What did you have to do?  It goes up to eight digits.  Uh-oh.  Did you just kind of...  Yeah, he's starting to gurgle.  Well, Eric, what are we up to?  This is 54.  54.  Jesus.  He's making everyone else look like a bunch of pussies.  Oh, he laughs at them.  Pat laughs at them.  Isn't he double what some of the guys were out at?  Oh, yeah.  Way.  Pat? 
[03:07:00]  His hands are in his pockets.  He's getting uncomfortable.  Okay.  Yeah, it's uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable.  All right.  Yeah.  You want to keep going, Pat?  I'll have a couple more.  Yeah, why not?  55.  I have one for the road.  You'll probably crash soon.  I'm going to put windshield wipers on the inside of my windshield.  Spray on that button, you son of a bitch.  What is this now?  This is 55.  55.  All right.  Every line.  Kenny, what do you think?  That's good for me.  Thanks.  I'm not standing nowhere near him, because when he lets loose, it's going to go across the 
[03:07:30]  studio.  I think it could hit the back window behind Anthony.  Just think of the pressure that stomach's under.  It is.  It's like a big rubber bag, all stretched, waiting to squeeze it out.  He's going to have hypervelocity.  He's going to puke.  He's going to keep blacks out of a college in 1964.  I'm just going to roll him out to the sidewalk.  Let's turn the lights back on.  All right.  This is 56. 
[03:08:00]  I think he needs to get to 60.  56 is such a weird number.  Yeah, it is.  56.  I mean, what is that?  Pants?  Wow.  What's wrong, Pat?  You're fine.  I'm feeling a little full.  Of course you are.  A little full.  All right.  57.  Three more.  Starting to space out that garbage can.  No, you won't puke.  You have four more.  You're fine.  We're all starting to like...  I'm starting to look around where I can duck.  It'll be after 60.  What's that?  It'll be after 60.  Oh, cocky.  Oh, you think?  Oh, look at you being cocky. 
[03:08:30]  58.  Have you ever drank as much eggnog before?  Martini Steve's in the studio.  He's figuring out how many calories with his little calculator.  What's he up to now?  57.  This is 58 right here.  And they're double shots, sweetie.  Right, right.  Yeah.  So how much is one, Steve?  170.  Multiply that by 57.  Thank you, Jim.  58 now.  58 now.  Just add.  Take 57 and add whatever...  Jim, can you stop, please?  All right, Pat.  9,860 so far. 
[03:09:00]  9,000.  Just about 10,000 calories.  This is number 59.  59, Pat.  He's really slowing down.  Yeah.  The face is looking a little different.  How are you feeling?  Getting ready to go.  One more.  Oh, boy.  All right, here's 60.  That's the first one he hasn't shot.  Now it's really slow.  But he's also not doing it in a minute.  He would probably do more if he had a minute in between each one.  Yeah, maybe.  Pat, what do you think?  Ready to go. 
[03:09:30]  Pretty soon.  If you do 60, I think you could do 62.  That's a 62.  Nah, 62.  Don't make him go up at 62.  62 is fine.  Yeah, 62.  Have you ever drank it?  This is 61.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can do two more.  Yeah, two more and then.  What are you, a gay?  What are you, a girl?  Come on.  Come on, eggnog dick.  Oh, he's really slowing down.  Yeah.  That's not done.  He didn't finish it.  That's not done.  Yeah, you didn't finish that.  That's not done, kid.  What's wrong with you?  60 what?  61. 
[03:10:00]  61?  62.  Oh, 62.  Yes.  He's like William Holtz.  Oh, my God, he just slammed 62.  Well, if you do 62, I think you could do what?  63, Jim?  I can't bend over to puke.  Uh-oh.  Someone better light a fire over here.  Everyone's moving.  Someone better raise that fucking garbage can, man.  Look, dude, if you did 62, you could do 63.  I mean, come on.  It's only one more.  What do you think, Pat? 
[03:10:30]  Ugh.  There has to be a grand finale.  Almost 63.  Doubled.  Yeah, there has to be a grand finale.  Wow, you can't just walk out after 62.  It's such an odd number.  It really is.  All right, here goes Pat.  63.  Maybe he needs some encouragement, everyone, in the studio.  Let's go, Pat.  Yeah.  63.  Don't do it.  He won't puke.  He's fine.  Pat, what do you think?  He's fine.  There's no more room at the inn.  Wow.  Sold out?  Sold out? 
[03:11:00]  Ha ha ha.  All right, what are we up to here?  This is 64.  64.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What does that mean, Pat?  You can't just walk out after 63.  65.  Double shots.  It's such a good number.  You want a donut?  Oh, yeah.  This is going to be like from the Monty Pine movie.  Waffle Thin.  Waffle Thin.  Waffle Thin.  You have to write ta-ta, but the wrong ho-ho, Pat.  Well, Pat, what do you think?  I'm getting gas pains now. 
[03:11:30]  Uh-oh.  Gas pains?  Oh, please shit your pants.  All right.  64.  I mean, he's so close to 65.  65 is that number.  65 is his max.  He can't go over 65.  That's enough.  Yeah, I don't think.  I think he's a pussy.  He can't go over 65.  He certainly can.  No, he can't.  No, 65.  That's a fine number to stop at.  Oh, wow.  Hey, they're cheering outside.  They want 70.  70 is such an even number, I think.  65.  Be happy with 65.  I don't know.  They want 70 outside.  The other contestants want 70. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, that's true.  BJ puked.  He's fine.  Yeah, BJ's fine.  Look at him.  He's smiling.  What is he up to, Eric?  This is 65.  65?  Only 65.  65 double shots of eggnog.  How many calories is he up to?  Well over 10,000 now.  Yeah.  I'm thinking of the point where I have to make myself puke.  Uh-oh.  No.  Yeah, you might have to.  Yeah, you might have to.  You've got to get rid of that stuff.  11,050.  Oh, no.  He has raised his two fingers, Anthony.  Do you want to do 66? 
[03:12:30]  66.  66.  66.  What do I win?  66.  You're going to puke it out.  The respect of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're the champ.  Here you go.  66.  Dude, you're raising the bar for a future contest here.  66 down.  66.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I have to make myself.  Yeah, you might have to make myself.  Then you better go before 67.  Yeah, I say you.  It's like a valve.  It's going in, but it ain't coming out.  Pat, I say you do 70 and then you make yourself puke.  I think that's, I think everyone would like to see that, right? 
[03:13:00]  How about you done?  This is 67 right here.  67 double shots of eggnog.  Holy shit.  Only three more in there.  Only three more.  That's okay.  That was 67.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he's getting 20 pounds in front of our eyes, man.  All right, here comes 68.  68.  What are you thinking, man?  You're studying him.  I don't know what to think.  68 double shot.  You're starting to sweat. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Jesus, Eric.  Just have him puke.  Well, no, he's got to get to 70.  69.  No.  He's got to get to 70.  No.  I say stop him.  He's got to get to 70.  You should stop him.  What do you want, Pat?  You want to walk away after 68 or?  It doesn't matter.  If he pukes, it's all coming out.  69.  69 done.  70.  An even 70 shot.  That's it.  No more, dude.  No more.  Wow. 
[03:14:00]  All right.  70 double shots of eggnog from Pat.  You doubled what the other guy did.  From Winock, New Jersey.  Represent in.  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  He's in the trailer park.  What do you want to do?  I want a puke.  All right.  Then you better do that.  Why don't you lift those two fingers up?  He's lifting his two fingers up.  It's all right.  He's got to do it.  Here we go.  He's got three fingers in his mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  This is Pat from Winocky Anthony.  This is good.  Oh.  That was just a warm-up.  That's two shots.  That's a warm-up.  That was a half-gallon. 
[03:14:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, everyone listen.  Listen.  Eric's running out. He's gonna puke also  How much eggnog is coming out of this guy? Wow. I've never seen so much eggnog come. 
[03:15:00]  Get me a bucket. Thank you. I can't live any harder. There's no way more is gonna come out of this guy. Is that it, Pat? No. 
[03:15:30]  It's 12,000 calories.  Bad day to start a diet.  Maybe he can get as many puke shots. 
[03:16:00]  Well done.  Oh, you're done?  Yeah.  Pat from Monaco, New Jersey.  Thank you.  Wow, was that a marathon puke.  How do you feel, man? You alright?  I feel better now.  Of course.  Holy S, he did 70 double shots of eggnog.  He got it out, too. He got most of that out.  Oh, yeah. That was a lot.  Well, Pat.  That's pretty heavy.  That bucket's, like, swimming.  Make Eric take that out. I think Eric should have to carry that out.  Eric vomited.  Eric vomited. 
[03:16:30]  How are you, Eric?  You can't speak.  Eric, take those buckets out.  Uh-oh.  Take that bucket out.  Eric.  Smell it.  Darren, get Eric on mic. Eric, what's up?  No, no, no.  What's the matter?  I'm gonna throw up.  No, you're not. You're fine.  Smell that wonderful puke smell.  Just, Eric, be careful.  Listen to that slosh around in there, Eric.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I was laughing so hard.  I couldn't breathe. 
[03:17:00]  Hey, I'll give somebody 10 bucks to smell Pat's two fingers.  Mmm.  Alright.  High five.  Oh, Kathy.  Alright, Pat, congratulations. You won the my five.  Thank you.  Oh, it does smell it.  Now I smell it.  I smell it.  Notice Ben hasn't been around.  Of course not.  Because Ben hates this stuff.  Where is he?  He's calming his hair with a hammer.  Oh, it's puke and fucking...  Wow.  He does reek in here now.  That was 4.3 gallons at 12,000 calories. 
[03:17:30]  Nice.  You drank 4.3...  Not gallons.  4.3 gallons.  You sure?  4 ounces per cup.  Yeah.  4 ounces per cup.  70 cups.  4 ounces per cup.  Do some more math, Steve.  Okay.  I thought it was 2 ounces per cup.  No.  It should be about 2 ounces.  2 shots.  There's no way the guy did 4.3 gallons.  You know, Steve...  Even 2 gallons would be crazy.  It's 2 shots.  2 shots.  Maybe it's 2 gallons, but it's still 12,000 calories.  A little over 2 gallons of eggnog from Pat. 
[03:18:00]  Alright, Pat.  We gotta give him something extra for doing all this.  He did an extra 35 shots.  He certainly did.  I don't know what we can give him.  We'll give him a t-shirt or something.  No.  Alright.  Why don't we get everyone out of the studio.  Pat is the winner of the eggnog drinking contest.  Congratulations.  Pat, any parting words?  Pat?  Parting words?  Yeah, Pat.  What do you want to say?  I feel like the biggest loser.  Oh, jeez.  Thank you, Pat.  Thank you.  Great job, Mike.  Pete from Connecticut online. 
[03:18:30]  Yes, Pete.  Yeah, I do.  I want to mind if I get 27 awful jokes by the end of the eggnog.  27 awful Pat jokes.  Very good.  Thank you, Pete.  Pete from Connecticut.  Let's say hi to Eric in New York City.  Eric, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  Good morning there, sweet tits.  Hi there, Angel.  I have a good puke story for you.  Alright.  I'm three months into dating my girlfriend.  I don't know.  I'm trying to get laid and get invited to a wedding. 
[03:19:00]  Get really drunk.  What are you calling from?  A nuclear reactor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  We're going to hum.  We're going to cut our losses there.  Brian from Long Island.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Syndication how?  Hey.  I just wanted to say 70 shots.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Yeah, it was definitely insane.  I cannot believe the guy just did 70 double shots of eggnog.  Hey, where's Jared?  Remember Jared?  Oh, yeah.  Who hates Ben?  He ends up winning the other MiFi. 
[03:19:30]  He guessed.  He was closest to how many shots?  40, right?  I think he was right on the button.  He said 35, I think.  Yep.  35.  He did win.  He did win.  Oh, my God.  Jared, give us a call back.  You won the other MiFi today.  How can him stick his whole fist down his throat like that and just gurgling?  It's probably better for him that he puked up.  Oh, yeah.  Without a doubt.  That's why I wanted him to keep going because if that's settled in, I think he would have  major problems later today.  I was actually getting worried about him.  I'm like, dude, he's diabetic, man.  I don't want to see if he gets gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, gurgle. 
[03:20:00]  How funny it would have been if he went into diabetic shock.  Hilarious.  We could have all teabagged him while the ambulance was on his way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eric, you feeling better?  Starting to, yeah.  It really stunk though, man.  That's sloshing vomit.  Oh, my God.  Did you get a whiff of that, dude?  Dude, how hard were you laughing?  Oh, that's too goddamn funny.  It was...  How many times did he power boot?  Like 10 times?  It's gotta be 10 and it was liquid.  Did that pill get used? 
[03:20:30]  Yes.  No.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Shut up, Jimmy.  All right, Jared.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up, Jared?  I won a MiFi.  Yes, you did.  After all that, you won the other MiFi today.  Awesome.  So I guess we'll get some info from you, so stay on the line, okay?  I already got the info.  Oh, you do?  All right, congratulations.  Anything you want to say to Ben?  Ben, you're not a dick.  Ben is kind of a dick because he blew off the whole contest.  He's a computer in there.  Is that the computer?  He's probably answering your stupid emails. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, bring...  Let's get Ben in here.  Let's get Ben in here.  There's no puke in here.  He could come back into the studio.  Ben.  I made a mistake, too.  They want to talk to you.  I only sent like 11 emails to Steve.  All right.  What is he saying?  He's saying no.  He's not coming in.  He said he's doing stuff.  Yeah, Ben has a serious problem with...  Oh, that's right.  He wasn't in here the whole time.  No, he ran out as soon as the contest started.  He went to screen the call.  I think he's gotta be in here for these contests.  You know, you're the boss open.  I think that you and Ed can put your feet down. 
[03:21:30]  He should.  He should.  All right, Jared.  Congratulations.  You won the other MiFi from Maine.  I appreciate it, guys.  I look forward to coming to the show, and you rock, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  There he goes, Jared from Maine.  Are we getting rid of all these people out here?  Um...  I would say if they want to hang for the extra time, we're almost done.  Yeah.  We're probably going to want to take pictures and stuff like that, probably.  Okay.  The gurgling, splashing sounds of vomit.  What you need is a rowboat going...  A motorboat.  A rowboat.  Fucking asshole, I am. 
[03:22:00]  A rowboat.  Row, row.  Ugh.  You stink.  A rowboat.  Ah, I can't find the clip.  Shut up.  A rowboat.  You stink.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Take another Brother Joe Christmas song.  Yeah, Christmas spirit.  This is the new one. 
[03:22:30]  Well, the tip, it's a glistening.  Hey there, hands, are you listening?  I'll pretend you're a chick whacking my dick  while I'm jerking off with my left hand.  Well, my balls, I will tickle as I yank on my pickle.  It felt so good stroking my wood while I was jerking off with my left hand. 
[03:23:00]  Here's another trick.  Here's another trick that I would use, man, to make it special when I'd want to come.  I'd fall asleep while lying on my arm and whack it when my hand goes nice and numb.  Tricks.  Tricks I'd learned in my teen years got me through all those lean years.  My head was my whore but I'd pretend it was more while I was jerking off with my left hand. 
[03:23:30]  While I was jerking off with my left hand.  While I was jerking off with my left hand.  While I was jerking off with my left hand.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F U line.  I just wanna give a big fuck you to the management staff of Best Buy 169 in Knoxville.

Fuck you, Howard!  I just wanted to give a big fuck you to Miguel for calling my cell phone for no reason.  I'd like to send a big F you out to the shit thick town of Washington  to do the programming and advertising on this little motherfucker.  You know what?  It's expensive of those advertising dollars with the fucking TV people

[03:27:00]  Don't go home and try that shit either, aren't you?  You know, people should laugh if that's good for you. 
[03:27:30]  The problem is you can't go out and see a comedian every night of the week.  You people have got to learn to amuse yourselves.  And I'm going to give you a couple of tips.  Like for instance, the next time you're the lead car in a funeral procession, make a wrong turn.  Oh, what the heck, lead everybody through a car wash.  Hot wax for the bereaved.  My favorite, you can do this any time. 
[03:28:00]  The next time you're in the supermarket, put things in other people's buggy when they're not looking.  And they'll get behind them in the checkout line.  I swear you'll see them, baby, like this line.  I don't remember getting that.  Then they'll pay for it.  Or if you should ever have to fill out another job application where it says,  nearest relative, put 12 miles. 
[03:28:30]  It's everything 24-7 XM 202. The O&A virus. It's everything, all the time.  It's everything 24-7 XM 202. The O&A virus. It's everything, all the time.  The O&A virus. It's everything, all the time.  The O&A virus. It's everything, all the time.  The O&A virus. It's everything.  B.M. Anthony xm 202.  Oh, man, that was a lot of fun. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  The eggnog drinking contest was a success today. 
[03:29:30]  And the bathroom just reeks because a couple of those garbage cans are in it, a little one.  It reeks.  Didn't Ben open the window?  I closed it.  Ben is back in the studio, Anthony.  He couldn't be bothered with the contest.  He hates...  I don't like the gross stuff.  I'm not into the gross stuff.  You guys know that.  Well, no one's into it.  He reminded me how much the studio stunk during the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Remember we used to have to put the Vicks under our noses for the whole contest?  And then we had some cops come in with the stuff that they used to clean dead bodies up with in apartments that have been there for months. 
[03:30:00]  And we had to put that all over the studio.  It smelled so bad.  Yeah, but at least we had that whole area, like, outside the studio.  So you didn't actually have to smell it while you were on the air.  Yeah.  I think also some of these guys went to the bathroom and puked some more.  Oh, dude.  That bathroom is awful.  Absolutely awful.  I didn't go in.  No, I'm holding it.  The phones have exploded.  Let's go to Lauren in Florida.  Lauren, what's up?  Exploded like Pat.  Yeah.  You guys have any idea how hard it is to drive a truck when you're puking your guts out at 70 mile an hour? 
[03:30:30]  What got you?  When you could just hear Pat puking?  Yes.  That last guy, when he started puking, he said, quiet, quiet.  You put the mic down there.  I lost it.  That was, I, since the poker chip incident, I haven't laughed that hard.  I was laughing so hard, I was trying to make myself stop.  It hurts so much.  We got to get the sound of that puking.  Yeah.  Can we get that again for the show?  It sounded like stew.  Yeah.  You dump stew or soup in the toilet. 
[03:31:00]  Out of a big pot into the toilet when it goes bad.  Yeah.  Oh.  And his finger, he didn't even pull his finger out.  He had two of those fingers jammed down his throat and he just left them there waiting for the next push.  Yeah.  He was puking over them.  He went three fingers.  Matter of fact, someone from whackbag.com writes,  I learned that yesterday a hot 20-year-old had three fingers in her vag,  and today an obese man had three fingers in his throat.  That's the beauty of this show.  One day it's really hot and the other day it's just awful.  And the beautiful thing is both hands smell the same. 
[03:31:30]  Bubba.  Bubba.  What's up?  What's up?  From Oklahoma.  Oh, my God.  I was dry even.  I was watering.  I was good right up until you got everything quiet.  Yeah.  Yep.  And then Pat exploded and I was doing everything I could not to puke on my window.  I knew we had to share with you guys.  I knew that the laughter was covering up way too much good stuff.  Had to hear that gurgling, puking sound.  All right.  Eric, what got you? 
[03:32:00]  What got you?  Because Birdman got really sick.  Yeah, he turned red.  Actually, I don't even know what color you turned.  It wasn't like red.  It was, I don't know.  Probably green.  Was it a whiff of the bile and eggnog?  It was one watching it, then hearing it, and then there was a smell.  A waft.  And then I lost it.  I threw the mic to Opie's brother and I just ran.  Couldn't handle it.  Yeah, fucking wings got really sick.  He actually puked.  He certainly did.  Yeah, he definitely did.  Let's go to Sean the trucker.  What's up, Sean?  Sean, I like how when he puked, it was over a little nest of baby birds and right in their 
[03:32:30]  little mouths, and then he flew off.  Go ahead, Sean.  Man, you guys, I've been listening to you since you guys come on the XM.  I've never heard of you before, and I love your show and everything, and I've heard some  disgusting stuff, but today was the point that I couldn't take anymore.  There was three of us talking on the CB, and when you said shut up, and we could hear  that, all three of us hit the damn side of the road, and we were all eggnog. 
[03:33:00]  Only the best for our pals out there in Radio Land.  Right.  We have to share with you guys.  All right, Sean, thank you.  Let's say hi to Doughboy from Wackbag.com.  Doughboy.  What's going on, guys?  I just wanted to congratulate that Pat Schitt from Wackbag.com and Foundry Music Chat.  Oh, that's another Wackbagger that won the contest, Pat?  Yeah, that's always good.  All right, good.  Congratulations, man.  But he drank 1.1 gallons, because 128 ounces in a gallon.  He's 270.  Steve.  Yeah, he drank five gallons.  I got a couple of, what did I learn? 
[03:33:30]  Steve said 4.3 gallons.  It was a little, a fraction over one gallon.  Steve's math is so off.  And he had a calculator, that idiot.  Right, and he was using a calculator.  Yeah, get Steve in here.  Can we get that dumbbell in here?  How is he using a calculator and screwing up like that?  Go ahead.  Unbelievable.  Go ahead, Doughboy.  Okay, I got, Opie's brother was in the book's depository and couldn't possibly have  reloaded fast enough.  Yep.  Eggnog is like drinking a blood clot, and Steve's shirt causes emphysema. 
[03:34:00]  Very good.  Punching out, boys.  Steve, your math stinks.  You had a calculator.  Yeah.  And you're so far off.  Was I really?  What was your formula?  Uh, eight.  What was it?  Thank you.  Uh, what is it?  Uh, there were four ounces per serving.  Uh, there was two servings in each of those.  It was double shots.  That's two ounces.  Two ounces.  No, no, no.  I mean, I'm sorry.  Yeah, but.  Each one of these was. 
[03:34:30]  What?  Each one of these, these things they were drinking, it was four ounces.  I thought it was two ounces.  Was it?  What's a shot?  It was two ounces of liquid.  That might be a.  Yeah, you don't measure the cup that they're not drinking at the point.  No, no, no, no.  Each to the line, I thought, was four ounces.  How did you think that?  If it's a shot, double shot, right?  Was it?  I don't know.  But even if you double it, it doesn't come out to 4.3.  Yeah, you used, how'd you get to an algebraic equation?  Because I got 256 ounces at some point, and we divided that by 64.  256.  What?  256 ounces was. 
[03:35:00]  And you had a calculator.  Right.  And I divided, wait, 256 by 64, which was.  That means you did 128 cups.  Maybe Steve compensated for all the liquid that evaporated from his flaming clothing  and had to add that back in.  The guy did 140 shots is what it comes down to.  Yeah.  Right.  So what's the math on that?  140 ounces.  Yeah.  140.  Oh, okay.  I was off.  I doubled it.  I doubled it.  You quadrupled it.  You said he did over four and a half gallons.  Yeah, that's pretty much you quadrupled it. 
[03:35:30]  Because if you take one fourth of that, it's pretty much what it was.  Okay, I quadrupled it.  So what did you do with your calculator?  After you get the equation, you just went times four equals?  I think I had the wrong number to begin with, so I just, I didn't.  Well, yeah, you just said, well, they were doing eight-hound shots.  What?  Well, these guys are, we're not really starting this, but they're quick with their, what have  we learned?  Let's go right to Rick in Toronto.  Go ahead, Rick.  Hey, I learned that it's Margie, Steve, and he's big, and he's stupid. 
[03:36:00]  And another Rick from Alabama.  Go ahead, Rick.  Yeah, I learned today that Steve can't add worth a shit.  Oh, Jesus, dude.  Mike, you puked too?  Oh, Steve.  Who the fuck farted?  I didn't fucking fart.  What the?  Eric over there.  Bullshit.  You started giggling right off the bat.  You started giggling.  But Ben always giggles at everything.  No, I would blame it on Jimmy.  Why?  Because you always do it.  I did drop one. 
[03:36:30]  Hey, where's that Jimmy Gas song, by the way?  We've got to give that a shot.  It wasn't me.  Speaking of farting, Ben, could you roll that over here, please?  It wasn't me.  Speaking of farting, imaginary Bill wrote a song called Gas Mask in honor of Jim Norton  and his farting.  Gas Mask?  Who was it?  Was it you or was it Steve?  No, I'm not the one who was giggling.  I think it was Steve.  You were the one who was giggling on the little phone.  Yeah, it was Steve.  He just pointed at himself and giggled.  Don't Brenno was farting.  Hey, my Brenno is for the farts in the Boston area.  Hey. 
[03:37:00]  It's like looking into a mirror, man, these two.  It's hilarious.  They're both herking and jerking.  Making sure they don't hit each other in the head.  All right, well, let's check out the imaginary Bill song.  It was Steve.  Was it?  It did.  He blasted one and started laughing.  Then he pawned it off and everyone else.  Then it was Steve.  All right, here's imaginary Bill.  One, two, three.  Stop coughing, stupid.  With his thin little lips and his condom-shaped head. 
[03:37:30]  Jimmy Norton's ass fumes will make you dead.  You'll need a gas mask.  A CEO gas mask.  If you sit him down, he'll bend the seat. 
[03:38:00]  You can change the things that he likes to eat.  Because he'll use his face like a toilet seat. 
[03:38:30]  And a taste of this makes his ass in me.  Gas mask.  Sounds like the B-side of she blinded me with science.  It's all right.  It's not bad.  A couple of lines you can't understand, though. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  It's a little weird there, but I like the gas mask thing.  I would love to dance to that song.  Would you?  Hey, why are you talking?  We didn't play your intro music yet.  Oh, sorry.  Hold on a second.  Paul from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Hey, you know, you've got to catch Steve some slack.  How do you expect them to work that little calculator with those big, fat, one of these fingers?  That's true.  They really are big, fat, meat fingers.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Here comes Club Soda Kenny.  He's big and stupid. 
[03:39:30]  Six foot five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big.  Hope you're ready, because here comes Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you.  And in the studio, it's Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  Yes, thank you.  What did you think of the contest?  Fantastic.  That's it?  Yeah.  Oh.  How were the contestants?  Well-behaved?  Yes.  You know I'm not that very articulate, so.  Yeah.  Simple one-word answers are good enough.  Yeah, they're all lurking around. 
[03:40:00]  I'd like to lose them.  Oh, really?  No one's left?  They look harmless?  Yeah, but you're going to have to shake their stupid hands.  No, there'll be no handshaking after a puke contest.  Why not?  We do a little fist.  A little tap of the fist.  Not even a fist.  How about an elbow?  Did you see the puke running down Pat's fist?  Yeah.  That was in his mouth?  It went all the way down to his elbow.  Oh.  Well, Kenny, I think it's time for the big announcement.  And you've been teasing all morning long.  It's a big one.  It is, huh? 
[03:40:30]  Do I wait until it's finished?  Yes, Kenny, you do.  It'll take like 20 more seconds.  Club soda, Kenny, with his big announcement.  Maybe you can start.  Start.  Yeah.  Wait.  Hold on.  It's almost over, Kenny.  All right.  You're going to do it all day. 
[03:41:00]  Let's go.  Well, I did such a great job.  Hold it, hold it, hold it.  Wait.  Yeah.  He's killing me.  I did such a great job on the HBO show Inside the NFL for the Thanksgiving special.  I just taped the Christmas special that will premiere on HBO Inside the NFL Wednesday night, 
[03:41:30]  December 22nd.  Wow.  Night before I go to the downtown.  I'll say.  And what will you be doing on this show?  Well, I did a lot of stupid things.  And what do you do?  You want me to give it away?  Or make everybody wait with bated breath?  I like the anticipations.  If you give away the punchline, people... 
[03:42:00]  All right.  We'll anticipate that.  What time is it on Wednesday the 22nd?  10 p.m.  And then it replays like that whole weekend.  Are you with Florentine too?  Yes.  My good friends, Jim Florentine, Don Jameson, and Eric McMahon, three fabulous comics, got  me in a little Christmas skit with them.  Oh, wow.  Well, that is a big announcement.  Yes.  Very happy for you, Kenny.  I know everybody can get back to their busy lives now that they heard the exciting news. 
[03:42:30]  Thank you, Kenny.  Here comes Club Soda Kenny.  He's big and stupid.  Six foot five killer who skips.  And if the shoe fits, it's big.  Hope you're ready, because here comes Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you.  You're welcome, Kenny.  No, thank you.  All right.  We're going to take another break, Anthony.  And then...  Yes.  We'll come back and finish the show up with What Did We Learn?  Very educational program.  We've been featuring Brother Joe's Christmas songs.  We'll do another one here.  Okay.  Got to find it first.  From our Demented World CD that you can't find anywhere anymore. 
[03:43:00]  We like this one, though.  Take off on an old classic.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Tell us every year, you friggin' nerd.  Glad to hear about your drunken grandma.  That tanked up bitch got just what she deserved.  Well, I spent that fateful Christmas.  With the dick that wrote this song. 
[03:43:30]  Granny drank whiskey with Quaaludes.  While toking Sensamean from a bomb.  I tried to greet his evil grandma.  But she kicked me in the nuts.  She was sucking on a crack pipe.  Yelling, piss off, die, you bastard scumbag putts.  Granny got run over by a reindeer. 
[03:44:00]  Every time I hear that song, I twitch.  Don't feel bad about that psycho grandma.  Grandpa paid old Santa off to hit the bitch.  There was dinner on the table.  Granny's crawling underneath.  Grandpa thanked Rudolph while kissing Santa's ass. 
[03:44:30]  Granny got run over by a reindeer.  That's when old St. Nicky creamed her.  Grandpa thanked Rudolph while kissing Santa's ass.  Granny got run over by a reindeer.  Copping dope outside on Christmas Eve.  Good riddance to that evil demon grandma. 
[03:45:00]  As for me and grandpa, we're relieved.  Oh, Granny was a ho.  We're the toys criminal show.  It's about being able to do the show we want to do.  Prison sex.  Give it to me.  We know what guys want to hear on the radio.  Adult-oriented subject matter.  Look at those jugs.  You opio puto cine megalo queomorfo.  They will exercise restraint.  This is going to be an awful show.  Hold on tight, kids.  I'll tell you, though, it's not easy having a couple of kids living here in New York on the west side. 
[03:45:30]  That's where I live, on the west side, uptown.  A very interesting neighborhood.  I live in the only neighborhood when I plan my budget I allow for hold-up money.  Why, I should have known there was something wrong when I took the apartment.  You know, the ad in the papers said, short run to subway. 
[03:46:00]  Well, there's trouble every day in my neighborhood.  They called a guy there sweet, a nut.  He kept calling up girls, you know.  It took them six months.  They tracked them down.  Called up hundreds of girls.  But the cops were on the roof.  The cops were very nice.  The cops gave them the usual courtesy.  They allowed him one phone call.  He called up a girl.  I used to love peanut butter.  Still do.  I saw something in the store the other day that I don't understand.  That peanut butter and jelly in the same jar. 
[03:46:30]  Is there a point to that?  I mean, I'm lazy, but I want to meet the guy that needs that.  Some guy going, you know, I could go for a sandwich, but I'm not going to open two jars.  I can't be opening and closing all kinds of jars.  Cleaning who knows how many knives.  If you're that lazy, you want to put croutons in there.  Get the whole sandwich on a spoon.  You know, just scooping it out. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, scrumptious.  I think I'm going to have another one.  Oh, delectable.  As was the first.  Or if you don't want to clean the spoon, you put it on a squeeze bottle.  Mmm, lunch and no cleanup.  Can life get better?  I submit that it cannot.  Actually, have you been out for Indian food?  Oh, bring a sandwich.  Bring two.  You can sell one.  I would have paid a C-note for a nice Italian beef in that place. 
[03:47:30]  Although I guess that would have been a faux pas, wouldn't it?  Indian food is different.  You know, I had it and geez, now I know why Gandhi went on a hunger strike.  Actually, I love the movie Gandhi and I do think he was a saint of a man.  Gandhi went on a hunger strike.  Because Muslims and Hindus were fighting. 
[03:48:00]  Now, a hunger strike, not my form of civil disobedience, but I respect it.  I prefer the sin-in.  But he went on a hunger strike and he threatened to starve himself to death and he almost did.  And Muslims and Hindus did stop fighting.  Now, he did this in India where the food's not that great.  Could he have done it if he was in Italy?  It would have been harder.  He would have been like, I will fast until all Muslims and Hindus are at peace. 
[03:48:30]  And if necessary, I will starve to...  Is that a plant I am smelling?  Oh, and pasta for Joel.  Yes, I would love some.  Thank you very much.  Would you put a little parmigiano-reggiano on there?  How do you grow up normal?  Everything that happens to you is kind of weird, you know?  Right when you're born, they tie your belly button up.  That's got to be like a very bizarre first experience.  You know, you come out... 
[03:49:00]  It doesn't come out like that, I guess.  I always figured doctors have to tie that.  I always wondered if doctors ever try to break their own records like those rodeo cowboys, you know?  They can, like, pull you out and go...  Boom!  3.5 on a belly button wrap-up.  That is a new state record.  The baby's got his foot tied in there for the rest of the life.  Bouncing around.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know the story. 
[03:49:30]  It's a story, and I don't know it.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Hey, let's play What Did We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony program.  A lot of fun today, huh?  I don't know, 10 of them already.  Any final thoughts there, Jimmy?  No, I enjoyed it.  I've been puking.  It really made my week.  There's something about watching people puke that just makes me laugh hard. 
[03:50:00]  Especially projectile vomit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I really thought he was going to puke forward, though.  I thought it was going to just spray all over the studio.  I'd love to see all the consoles spray.  You know how hard it would be to get puke out of that electronic equipment in front of you?  Oh, yeah.  You know, one of the guys...  Who was it?  Matt?  Is that his name?  The one that really, like...  It was like a rocket ship exhaust.  It was amazing, the power.  Power puking.  Power booting.  For some reason, it is funny.  The guy you said looked like Turner and Hooch.  I thought got a piece on sex bagel.  Oh, and he shook his head. 
[03:50:30]  And it just went...  It was spraying everywhere.  Okay, let's go to...  Boo Boo Kitty in Louisiana.  What's up, Boo Boo Kitty?  Hey, Twinkle Cheeks.  Hi, Boo Boo.  Yeah, I just wanted to...  Love you, Boo Boo.  Yeah.  Boo Boo.  I wanted to give a big fuck to Anthony first, because he picked up his fake fucking laugh.  Oh, I'm always hearing that.  But I learned today that...  Oh, I'm always hearing that.  Hawk should be called Sweet Hawk, because he's got a pussy for his stomach.  Yeah, Hawk has a pussy stomach.  We did learn that today.  Tom in Connecticut, go ahead. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, my God.  Guys.  Tom.  Buddy.  Tommy.  You.  All right.  I bet his name isn't Tom.  Probably.  Bill in PA, what's up?  Hey, how much, guys?  Hey, Tinkle Bag.  Hi, Angel Face.  Hey, I miss you.  If you put a gallon of eggnog near an open flame, it reduces to 64 ounces.  Right.  It reduced down.  Very good.  I like that.  Todd the Trucker.  What's up, Todd?  Morning, Ope.  Morning, Ant.  Hey.  Hello.  Morning, Todd. 
[03:51:30]  Welcome to the program.  Good morning, regurgitation influencer.  Hey, I learned that Nathaniel's going to be at the downtown.  What's that, sir?  I learned that Nathaniel's going to be at the downtown December 23rd for naughty Nathaniel's Christmas.  He is, and the number for Nathaniel's tickets are 516-293-7700.  Nathaniel, the intern, at the downtown in Long Island, December 23rd.  And Jimmy will be joining us.  And if you want to learn more, if you want to learn more, you can go to www.eatabullet.com. 
[03:52:00]  That's right.  Or, if you're a female, you can go to yellowtreats.all.com.  Oh, you remember that from yesterday.  Thank you, sir.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Guys, educated.  Let's go to Bill on Long Island.  What's up, Bill?  How you doing?  Hey.  Hello, Bill.  I learned that.  Love that one.  Who's talking over me?  Ben was.  Sorry.  Bill, go ahead.  Drinking a gallon of eggnog produces four gallons of puke.  Punching out.  Yeah, that was.  Yeah. 
[03:52:30]  Oh, that doesn't even deserve the crash.  No.  Mikey Biggs from whackbag.com.  The starter not working.  Click.  Today, I learned the last time people chanted for dice was 10 years ago.  Roman War Helmet.  I learned that the eggnog challenge would never have been on at 102.7 KTU.  Fess Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Today, I learned a drunken fat man caused a 17-car pileup of comedy today.  Tom from Merrick.  I learned today that heat will make a calculator malfunction. 
[03:53:00]  Pete from whackbag.  I learned if you don't know the answer to math problems, multiply by four.  Mike from Hawaii checking in.  Very nice.  Does Steve's calculator have flames on it, too?  Did it?  No, we didn't check.  All right.  Bill from Waterford, New York.  Today, I learned that there were only nine competitors for the eggnog contest because Pat ate the 10th contestant and drank for two.  Chris from Boston.  He learned Ben is a crazy-haired dick.  Beavis from Long Island.  Today, I learned that puke garbage cans are more important than fire exits. 
[03:53:30]  Boner from Jersey says, today, I learned that Frankie Blue will be playing golf with old people next week.  Very good.  Ooh, ouch.  Are we going to go to this mashup?  How much time we got left?  Right now?  No?  Not yet.  What?  Okay.  No, there's a lot of staying in it.  All right.  Dave from Connecticut.  I learned that Connor could have drowned all over again in Pat's puke bucket.  Sorry, I couldn't read that one.  I wrecked that one.  Olderly from Canada.  I learned that you don't need to take a math test to work at XM. 
[03:54:00]  30 seconds left in the show.  What's the mashup?  It's a good one.  It's Green Day and Oasis.  Green Day, Travis, Aerosmith, and Oasis.  And Oasis?  Wow.  That sounds awful.  That is a huge mashup.  Why not?  It's no Aussie.  We'll play that as we get out of here for the weekend.  What are we going to...  We had a great week of radio.  Thanks, guys.  Spread the virus for us if you're enjoying what you're hearing.  Kenny, anything?  You've got five seconds.  Anything?  Club Soda Kenny?  Great show today, boys.  All right.  We'll leave you with this.  Thank you, guys.  We'll see you Monday.  See you Monday.  We'll see you Monday.

Mark has been my best friend for many years now, and I wrote a song.  About one.  To kind of...  That's a lot of months.  Years.  I wrote a song to kind of celebrate what I think is our greatest asset as friends,  and that's our complete and utter differences.  We're total opposites when it comes to almost everything.  Completely.  So I wrote a song, and we're going to sing it for you now.  Gay?  Not gay.  I like my toast buttered, and I'll take mine dry.

Yeah.  I want to fuck your sister.  I want to fuck her in her fucking face.  And if I could have all her fucking hair.  No, hey.  That's sticking in her eyeball.  Oh, my God.
