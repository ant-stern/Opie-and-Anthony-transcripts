<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie and Anthony discussing their show's long run and its history of controversy.  Sam was absent due to a surprise early wedding in Kentucky, and Travis was out sick with gastrointestinal issues.  The hosts then launched into a discussion about Opie's encounter with a group of women from the Red Hat Society at his brother's restaurant, F.H. Riley's.  This sparked a lengthy segment featuring caller anecdotes and Opie reading a poem believed to have inspired the society.  The conversation naturally progressed to the aging process, punctuated by jokes and observations from the hosts.

The show then shifted to the hosts' upcoming attendance at a Paul McCartney SiriusXM special.  They compared the significance of their celebrity photos (Opie's Bill Clinton photo vs. Anthony's Black Sabbath photo) and recounted a humorous story about how they managed to secure invitations after initially being left off the list.  This led to a significant portion of the show dedicated to brainstorming a contest to give away extra tickets to listeners.  This process proved challenging due to the need for SiriusXM management approval ("running it up the flagpole"), leading to much frustration and reminiscing about their less-regulated past.  The hosts bounced around numerous ideas, many wildly outrageous and involving stunts, often referencing past, unaired stunts involving bodily functions and explicit acts.  Gary, Z-Rock, and E-Rock were mentioned as key players in the approval process.  They considered a "Die Hard 3" themed entry and mocked a Chris Angel magic kit commercial.  Kurt Metzger was mentioned as an upcoming guest.  After many rejected ideas, a simpler contest was eventually settled upon. A listener's inaccurate account of an ice cream truck incident and a murder suspect was also corrected.

The next segment delved into a behind-the-scenes conflict regarding a producer's role in securing approval for creative segments, specifically one involving a wooden leg.  Kurt Metzger then joined the show as a guest, recounting his experiences filling in for Tracy Morgan, including details of Morgan's outrageous stage behavior, such as exposing his pubic hair.  The hosts and Metzger shared anecdotes about Morgan's behavior and the challenges of dealing with publicists and fame.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to mocking a poorly performed "Comfortably Numb" cover by a band called "Stink Floyd" (or similar).  This led to a discussion of other awful cover videos found on YouTube, notably "Creed Shreds."  The show returned to the frustratingly restrictive rules imposed by management on the Paul McCartney ticket contest, with speculation on the reasons behind these limitations.  More off-color jokes and further discussion of the contest concluded this segment.

The final segment continued the brainstorming of the Paul McCartney ticket giveaway, again highlighting the difficulties imposed by SiriusXM's approval process and past negative experiences with giveaways.  A caller attempted to advertise a quick cash scam, prompting a discussion on internet scams and their targets.  Kurt Metzger shared his experiences as a former Jehovah's Witness, explaining his departure from the religion.  Jackie Martling joined the show, sharing anecdotes from his career, including a humorous story about an accidental orgy with Jessica Hahn and Howard Stern (and his subsequent on-air apology to his wife), and awkward game show encounters.  The hosts and Kurt shared stories about bad relationships.  The show concluded by promoting upcoming stand-up shows for the hosts, Kurt, and Jackie, and a humorous anecdote about Jackie's unexpected kiss with Florence Henderson.

[00:04:30]  the many jokes that were made when i tweeted the picture yesterday afternoon but it was uncomfortable  to look at just old ladies in red hats old ladies in red hats and i guess this is a phenomenon that  happens across america no way it's that big i guess so and what is the do you want the real  answer i i didn't really want the real answer when i tweeted the picture i wanted goof answers well  yeah goof answers but at some point i would like to know what this is all about jimmy there's the  picture uh something communist and then some of the women because they're wearing the red hats

[00:09:00]  sorry hey guys how are you morning eric what is the what is the red hat society about  oh as far as i know you struck upon the two key factors of the red hat society yeah they're old  women and they wear red hats that's pretty much it it's a fucking social group and it's just a bunch  of friends and they get together and they go out to a restaurant and they wear a nice red hat and 
[00:09:30]  they all they all have these massive collections of creative and different and fancy red hats and  they go out is there a big like is there a big to do like trying to choose which hat i think so  what do i wear i think they hunt out their red hat so they stand out uh among the other red hat  right it's their gang colors they yeah yeah they get the red and blue hats and they go and kill each  other with fucking hat pins yeah you think uh you think they beat in each other yes oh they have 
[00:10:00]  roll by shootings in their wheelchairs they poke each other to death with hat pins eric  eric you do realize that they they look ridiculous wearing their red hats absolutely my mom's in the  in the red hat society in tucson arizona and it and it's it's it's that's all it is i'm starting to  she gets all excited we'll be you know we'll be out shopping or something she'll see a new red hat 
[00:10:30]  oh this just sounds silly i'm starting to think that it just gotta suck to get old and and there's  there's boredom that happens thanks man because yeah probably a lot of these women you know did did  the thing and had their kids and whatever and maybe a lot of their husbands are now dead their kids are  you know living their own lives gone then they join the red hat society to pass the days i guess 
[00:11:00]  i don't know what they do they get together and have lunch and look ridiculous in their red hats  enough about the hats about the hats uh there was a simpsons episode where marge wanted to join  the red hat society oh really oh fuck this is bigger than i realized rock would know about that  iraq he's a big fan of the simpsons i vaguely remember that oh thank you i do have something  on the on the red hats down south um at least that i saw in florida they would do red hats and purple 
[00:11:30]  dresses so you'd see a huge group of of just the same hat but also and these were white people  old old white ladies wearing red hats and purple dresses oh my god sounds like the outside of a  baptist church how unfuckable do you want to look i know oh uh brian in philly hey uh good morning  obi anthony what's up yeah there was a episode of the simpsons where marge was uh desperate to join  this red hat society she thought that if she could uh fit in she'd be uh part of the upper class of 
[00:12:00]  society but it ended in disappointment because when she got in it turned out they were just a bunch of  cunt oh really were they all stuck up yeah that's about it these women looked like they had a bit of  an attitude i i didn't want to i don't want to delve too much into it because my brother's joint i  didn't want to blow up his spot but trust me i wanted to to do an expose on the red hat society at  fhs today uh did you know a woman under the age of 50 may become a member but she wears a pink hat and  lavender attire to society events until she reaches her 50th birthday then uh and she will be referred to 
[00:12:30]  uh until then as a pink hatter and and that's bad pink looks better on women than red and what  is that hatters are that they're like the young and what does that mean that they have some some  juice left in their cunts yeah it hasn't been completely wiped barren i don't think they like  to put it that way but you're probably right is that in their bylaws at this point i want to say  good morning to my in-laws i listen every morning at this time they love it no they do actually what do 
[00:13:00]  you think they give the yeah a little a little moisture left do you think they got a little  moisture little moisture there might be one egg waiting to drop and there is an age limit oh there  is what's the age limit mike is that what it was talking about mike no i was reading it off of uh  i was gonna touch on the same subject oh and uh good morning jimmy oh i thought there was an age  limit as far as how old they could be oh god as old as the red hat in the coffin really and they 
[00:13:30]  each try no age limit  they try to see who can outdo each other by getting the bigger dumber hat  and get all that stupid costume jewelry on how is it that i've lived this long and i'd never heard  of the red hat society you're a guy you have no interaction with anybody yeah but we do a radio  show so we pick up we pick up on things that we would never pick up on if we didn't have a radio  show you know what i mean but this is something that it's out of the blue out of the red out of 
[00:14:00]  the red yes my mom got one all right listen oh jesus there's the purple dresses and the red hats  there's two people that or or those get everybody their drinks and food i was gonna say or are those  too naked  it's a group picture and it sure is a couple of people that don't look like they fit oh boy it  looks like uh oh whatever i'm not the racist and they give them and they give them names like that  the west like that wesley red hatters i guess uh is motorcycle gang i would love to think that 
[00:14:30]  it's some kind of sorority thing and this just evil sorority shit going on yeah you think like oh  they're hazing each other with wiffle ball bats right uh jason in new york i i just wanted to  bring this up for two minutes i swear but look at the phones it's a whole thing now fixated on that  dumb hat jason what's up what's up uh what do you call my they actually give each other little names  where uh my mother's name is hattie does everything where they you know somebody does something you 
[00:15:00]  know they get a name like queen uh what is it i think one of them is queen alcohol because they  actually all i do is go out and get drunk and your mom's name is what queen does everything  are they they all have names that start with queen yeah queen princess oh my god princess queen  oh and you know all these broads we're looking at another group picture you know they were all  pieces of asses during their time probably some of them most of them probably and this is how it 
[00:15:30]  ends up this is how it ends up that's it you're having lunch with a goofy red hat on somewhere  yep at one point a guy with a pencil mustache was getting his red wings with her and and now  it's red hats geez how disappointing hey this is a nice coincidence uh always sunny in philly uh  talked about the red hat society last night there mc yeah morning boys really yeah they uh they went to  atlantic city in the episode last night and uh it was a quick little montage and they were they were 
[00:16:00]  you know getting smashed and a quick little picture with all these old bats and red hats like that guy  said they were all wearing purple dresses my girlfriend's grandma used to be part of this  i think the only common bond is that they're old and they wear red hats that's what i'm getting at  the only common bond we don't know what else it's about do they at least raise money for a good cause  or something i don't know i don't know i think it's just the fact that they're all  fucking geriatric old women origin though i want an origin here i want something come from 
[00:16:30]  what like how did it start i don't know thank you sir uh history uh i don't know your name but it  looks like you're calling from indiana go ahead yeah it's ryan you blocked me on on twitter okay that  made me sad but i only blocked complete assholes so you must have said something i don't know what i  did to you sir but whatever it was i apologize but anyway well what's your twitter name yeah what is  your twitter name it's yeah all right so well that means that means you were hiding behind your

[00:18:00]  do when they die i don't know if it's like a thing they all do but that was the move everyone who came  up the reviewer placed their um their hat on the coffin it's very kind of unreal yes can we go to  the history there uh danny for a sec i saw that up there um that uh all right thank you thank you  brother the founder of the society's artist sue ellen cooper she's in fullerton california in 1997  cooper gave a friend a 55th birthday gift consisting of a red fedora purchased a year earlier at a thrift 
[00:18:30]  store along with a copy of jenny joseph's poem warning the opening lines of the poem read when  i am an old woman i shall wear purple with a red hat that doesn't go and doesn't suit me sounds like  a beating i'll get i'll wear purple can we get the rest of the ball under her eye we need the rest of  the poem if it's warning cooper repeated the gift on requests uh several times and eventually several of  the women bought purple outfits and held a tea party cooper never set out to ignite an 
[00:19:00]  international phenomenon however after spreading by word of mouth the society first received national  publicity in 2000 i thought this was like an ancient thing um hat let's see uh cooper then  established the hat quarters get it uh to field the hundreds of emails request request for help  starting chapters and now serves as exalted queen mother and has written two best-selling books about 
[00:19:30]  the society so it's a relatively new thing 97 uh i thought i thought this might might have gone  back to the civil war or something um oh my god no it's taken over the country it's a bunch of  stupid white old biddies who want to fit in yeah i thought they were commemorating maybe jfk  and his ride in dallas thank you another another goof answer it's what i was looking for yesterday it  looks like a hat yes it's red uh uh jimmy you're good at reading poems aren't you yes jimmy's a great

[00:33:30]  yeah a bunch of smelly old ladies yeah please diaperish i'm sure there's a bunch of people that  went to woodstock that are now wearing red red purple dresses they were in behind the  fucking trees near the the lake just fucking and blowing guys at the same time another at the red  hat society and now they're having lunch with a goofy red hat guys don't fucking want to deal with  that they don't want to fucking sit there and go oh well the wife's going to the red hat society think 
[00:34:00]  fuck that you know how we like to talk about how times i want to see as a cap and gown  does she have a black eye the one in the front a black guy no oh what is that a cataract surgery  probably it's just the way that the the shadow is on her glasses okay um you know how we talk about  how like time is a bitch remember i told you i was watching the woodstock uh now and then yeah then  and now whatever the um i guess there's a museum where the woodstock happened yeah and you know 
[00:34:30]  the famous woodstock cover oh yeah yeah where like the couple's wrapped in the blanket and she's  got oh no this is the hippie chick and the hippie guy you're thinking wow man right on you know yeah  yeah something cool about that yeah well the couple that showed up at the museum to brag that they're  the ones on the cover yeah was deeply depressing oh no and and none of us escape it i'm not trying to  say no i'm different than anyone else it was deeply depressing what she looks like now 
[00:35:00]  not that and she couldn't be chick and she just wanted to tell everyone that that's her on the  cover i remember we were at the woodstock yeah the groovy hippie glasses have been replaced by  pretty much old lady glasses thick the long blonde hair has been completely chopped off of course  because it's more women do it's easier when they get so much easier to manage there it is yeah and  the body i think she ate her former self let's just put it that way oh no wait is there i'm gonna try 
[00:35:30]  find it wait did you see that picture before you went there it looked like they reenacted the photo  well i didn't see that one i saw the actual one that danny just uh pulled up okay yeah that's the  actual that's the actual photo okay they're in a shitty stinky blanket like covered with puke and  wait you don't see that i i gotta go back i'm sorry danny the one  the one oh i'm sorry you see that that's them oh okay okay i was right that's what she looks like 
[00:36:00]  oh no that's what she looks like yikes yeah he's blowing it up that's what and they're they're wrapped  up in a blanket to reenact it and you know what i think that was a few years ago that just uh yeah the  guy lost all his groovy hippie hair all his groovy hair is gone he's it's totally white i know this  happens to all of us i know she has the bob haircut right that's the same couple why why that why are  those two so famous because they were on the cover of the woodstock album woodstock album oh is that 
[00:36:30]  like the uh the end of the festival or the middle of it it looks like the end of the festival that's  probably right in the heart of it yeah they might have been on the outskirts there yeah i don't  know you're just because that's all people in the background looks like too so yeah but that's what they  look like now you could do that uh how do you get there uh danny if they uh do a google search yes  for woodstock cover yes it'll show up in the images if you send me that there send me that picture i'll 
[00:37:00]  just tweet it no problem so oh yeah man she's probably a red hatter you think yeah that's what i'm getting  at they have to be they have to be close to 60 i would imagine right yeah man they would have to be that  woodstock is what 41 years ago already yeah so they're in their 60s authority man most overrated  event in history you think yes why would you say because i'm it was a cool music festival  but it's just it had it's become this this cultural it was a bunch of fucking people who for free got 
[00:37:30]  high and watched a show yeah who gave a shit and they're starting to overrated they're starting to  admit it was a a moment and not a movement which is key well that's the end of the whole thing  it was it started a movement it was going to start it it was the end of the whole fucking 60s really it  was the end of uh all that shit it was just a moment the end of the hippies the end of everything  the 70s were right around the fucking corner you know that hendrix only played to 40 000 people 
[00:38:00]  yeah he was considering there was about 400 000 there why because they all ran late  and he played like monday morning at 10 in the morning and like he he was supposed to close the  whole thing in front of 400 000 but by the time they got to him most of the people were gone isn't  the story that like he he wouldn't play unless he headlined yeah so by the time it was time for the  headliner it was fucking so late and good job early everybody left it's like kanye wanting to go on  his fucking uh uh uh whatever the festival is uh right which one they do bonnaroo yeah but i mean but 
[00:38:30]  then hendrix does the most amazing version of star spangled banner yeah here to this day  but he played it to nobody  yeah man wow so so what uh what time did he go on it was at night right no no i'm saying  monday morning and it was just a sea of shit mud blankets and and garbage that he played to  and a few fucking straggler hippies they did a good job with it on the history channel if you if you 
[00:39:00]  care it's called uh then and now woodstock so that was it it was like what august 69 and then a few  months later the 70s were right there and uh that was it well in the 60s fucking they tried to do a  little woodstock thing out west there with altamont and yeah that didn't go well it was a little  different than woodstock sisters brothers and sisters take care of your brothers and sisters mix on 
[00:39:30]  stage that hell's angels just fucking beating the fuck out of people stabbing people as well as they  should yes did that one guy have a knife they were actually preventing a guy from doing the guy wanted  to like fuck up mc jagger or something yeah yeah get up on stage and the guy was so they killed him  right yeah this video of it good hendrix was a major star who were in the traditional headlining position  uh playing last technically a technical and weather delays caused the festival to stretch into monday  morning the organizers had given hendrix the opportunity to go on at midnight but he opted 
[00:40:00]  to be the closer uh one benefit of the delay the morning light made for excellent filming conditions  which may uh be part of the reason this particular hendrix performance is so well known yeah because if  you watch the uh watch the movie a lot of the nighttime performances very hard to say like the who went  on at night yep um a few other like a sly sly and the family stone how's the who look at night the  who actually kicked fucking ass at woodstock from what i saw in the no but who uh wasn't there 
[00:40:30]  i want to see what their what their footage was of the who  yeah this is hendrix i mean everyone moved up to the stage so it looks a little better  i mean 40 000 is still a lot of people but look right behind there's nobody that was that was just  a sea of people yeah hendrix is i mean look look i'm headlining  that's how cool he is though or was he didn't care he was probably so  fucking heroin wow he was a small he was on the horse he was on the horse yeah yeah all right we 
[00:41:00]  should break get into some other things i've gotta eat yeah because it's uh only three hours until  a certain thing goes on sale oh that's right don't don't dilly dally on this one this thing's  gonna sell out like the first gonna go and you're gonna be out of shit ass out of luck as they say  me bird dave and uh brewer february january 15th at the borgata show number two is on sale in three

[00:43:30]  when love went blind and you would make me see  i'd stare a lifetime into your eyes  so  so  i  i  i  i  i  i 
[00:44:00]  i  i  i  Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day, I want to be saved, I remember you. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, what's the dead air all about there, E-Rock?  The let just didn't want to play it.  Here it goes.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On the virus, Sirius XM.  Paul McCartney doing a special show for Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Certainly is.  Was I supposed to hit the post there?  I don't know.  I could have very easily. 
[00:45:00]  Just got lazy.  Still talking over the lyrics.  Yeah.  When I think McCartney, though, I think other songs.  Yeah, yeah.  But I think this was played as a goof.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because we like goofing on this one.  We certainly do.  It's not one of my favorites.  It's certainly not one of yours.  No.  Jimmy despises it.  When I see Paul McCartney, I don't want him wasting valuable Paul McCartney song time playing this shit.  What are the odds that we actually get to meet a Beatle? 
[00:45:30]  Zero.  You think zero?  Zero.  You think the odds are zero that we meet a Beatle?  Zero.  We're going to the special Paul McCartney show.  Yeah, I know.  In a week or so.  You think we'll actually get to meet him?  No.  Absolutely not.  I think if I could get a picture of Paul McCartney, that would be bigger than my Bill Clinton picture.  No, it's not.  No way.  I think so.  Clinton or fucking a Beatle?  A Beatle way over a present.  I don't know.  You might be right on that one.  Way over a Beatle.  Clinton is pretty accessible for photos when he's out and about. 
[00:46:00]  Maybe, but the thing is this, Clinton, there's only, I mean, I know there's only been four  Beatles, but to me, a U.S. president is a much more important figure historically.  It's a much bigger VIP.  It has a much bigger effect historically.  Can we agree that I have the greatest celebrity photo in the room?  You don't have the one.  I love my celebrity photo more than that.  What's your biggest one?  Sabbath as a band is my favorite.  But Clinton's much bigger. 
[00:46:30]  Of course he is.  But to me, I'd rather take Sabbath as a band.  Does it bother you?  You don't have a picture with the president?  I would love one, yeah.  I really would.  I'd love to get Bush Sr. and Jr. together.  I got a picture of Bush's limo going by, and I got a picture of Obama's limo going by.  Stop trying to act like you have three presidents.  You only have one.  Just stop it.  One president and two cars.  When we were checking out Obama, you bailed too early, and then I found another way to  go see his limo, and I snapped him looking right at me through a fucking limo window.  That's good. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, music, stop right there.  Everybody gonna be alright.  Everybody gonna shh.  I'm looking forward to the concert.  Oh, you guys want to hear Roland's version of this?  It makes it much better for everybody.  Are you going in?  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got to go to that.  Everybody's gonna feel alright.  Everybody's gonna dance around tonight.  Sounds great.  Oh, that's horrible. 
[00:47:30]  Angry birds.  None of us are gonna get to meet the party, by the way.  No.  We so don't rate for a picture with Paul McCartney.  No.  But then again, here's the thing.  I'm sure there'll be a few people getting to hang out with Paul when he does the special show.  Very few, because he's the guy that everybody wants to call in favors for.  Mel wants to talk to.  I'm sure Mel's met him, but every executive wants to talk to him.  Yeah, all the brass.  I want to make it clear that I can talk about this place every day, and trust me, I try not to. 
[00:48:00]  But they didn't want to invite us to the Paul McCartney show.  I forced their hand.  You think?  Yes.  They were thinking that we would not notice.  And then all of a sudden, I kind of said, hey, what's up with that Paul McCartney show?  And then somebody actually said to me, I'll keep the names out today.  Somebody actually said to me, you guys were invited.  I go, I never got a fucking corporate.  I got a fucking corporate email that I was invited to the Paul McCartney show.  But I did.  And this person was like, really?  What?  And then on the way home that day, we got an email from Scott Greenstein inviting us to the Paul McCartney show. 
[00:48:30]  I didn't.  We obviously were.  I didn't.  And you didn't.  Then when did yours come?  I got one from one of the lower management people that said, we need your RSVP on the Paul McCartney thing.  Are you going?  I was like, this is the first email I got saying anything about it.  And I'm not going to listen to any of the guys down the hall.  They were hoping we didn't notice.  And then when we called them out on it, they're like, of course you're invited. 
[00:49:00]  It's two more seats.  I have to disagree.  I got one.  I got one the day before you said that.  They would never invite me and not you guys.  I really think that they got sent out.  No, no, no.  No way.  No.  Because you do the music show.  Yeah.  They love you.  I think they would.  I couldn't get Halford on my show yesterday.  I don't have McCartney juice.  They love you.  All I'm saying is.  But it literally went.  I think they all went out together.  No, I didn't get the invite until we bitched about it.  Maybe they resent it.  I'm not defending them.  And that bitch session, trust me, was off the air. 
[00:49:30]  I'm like, of course we weren't invited.  Why would we be invited to that?  And then, you know, as I'm walking home, the email comes in from Scott Greenstein.  Come on.  Someone.  Someone.  Yeah, that's a little.  Someone was kind of like.  Someone went like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  We got to invite these guys.  And then I had to make it clear there wouldn't be any problems with anybody.  No, there's not going to be any problems.  I want to check out Paul McCartney.  It's at the Apollo.  Yeah.  Uptown.  I'm going just to watch Ant go to the Apollo.  Uptown.  I know, right?  Do you know, I was supposed to be in L.A. that night shooting for Leno. 
[00:50:00]  No, you won't.  Not the show, but a pre-tape piece I'm doing.  And I actually asked if we could move it a day.  And Leno said yes?  Well, because the air date is not effective.  That's pretty cool.  It's just a one-day moving to shoot from Tuesday to Wednesday.  Yeah.  But I mean, come on.  It is McCartney.  You have to go.  Yeah.  That's exactly why.  And it leads to this.  How many tickets have we got?  Two pairs?  We got two pairs to see this special show that SiriusXM is doing.  But I think it's to promote the fact that they got 20 million subscribers, I guess. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah?  That's a massive show.  Yeah.  And Paul McCartney is, you know, he's all right, man.  That's kind of fucking cool to see, you know?  That's history.  You think he's going to do Uncle Albert?  Yeah.  No.  You don't know Uncle Albert?  I know Uncle Albert, but I don't think he's going to do it.  Oh, I know it.  It's a big hit.  1970, 71.  He won't do that one.  He won't do Uncle Albert?  No.  Ugh. 
[00:51:00]  You don't like this one either?  No.  I hate this part.  We're so sorry, Uncle Albert, but we haven't done a bloody thing all day.  We're so sorry.  I hate that part.  You know all this shit.  I hate it.  Why do you search out stuff you hate?  I don't know.  Why?  That's a great point.  Why the fuck do I?  Can you do that again?  It has nothing to do with the song.  We're so sorry, Uncle Albert, but we haven't done a bloody thing all day.  We're so sorry, Uncle Albert. 
[00:51:30]  What about the other part?  It's been so easy all the way.  I hate it.  I hate that part.  And what about the...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And some pumpkin pie?  Yeah, yeah.  Pie?  Pie?  Pie?  What about the pie?  Put it in the pie.  What?  How are we going to give these tickets to us?  I don't know. 
[00:52:00]  We've got to do something.  What do you want to do, Jimmy?  I don't know.  We can't just have some schlub call up and get tickets to see McCartney.  You're good at the games.  Jimmy's going to come up with a game.  We're a...  When do we have to get them out?  I thought we were going to do like 90s McCartney solo career trivia.  They have to be in studio for that?  90s McCartney solo trivia.  Yeah, because that's a fan.  That's impossible.  That's a real fan.  Yeah, we want real fans.  Do they have to be in studio?  Because they can't be at home. 
[00:52:30]  They can't be on the internet.  Well, no.  They kind of have to be on the phone because we have to give them away today.  There it is.  All day.  I hate this.  We're so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Uncle Albert.  Uncle Albert.  But the candles on the moral can be so easily gone away.  All the way.  Is that Paul McCartney doing that part?  I think so.  Oh.  Because if it wasn't, that would be a good trivia question.  Who's doing that fucking part of the song? 
[00:53:00]  We're so sorry.  What?  What?  You had something, didn't you?  I did.  And decided no?  Yeah.  Wow.  Really?  No, no.  We're so sorry, Uncle Paul.  But we haven't seen a bloody ass all day.  That's a good one.  Eleanor Rigby's an old lady.  She wears a red hat.  Uncle Paul.  No. 
[00:53:30]  We're so sorry.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  TOOTLE-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO 
[00:54:00]  You think he'll do Let It Be?  Oh, God, I hope so.  Yeah, he'll do all of his big hits, I think.  Do you think the red carpet's going to look like it?  There's probably going to be a lot.  I think Clinton's there.  Really?  You think?  Well, he's up there, right?  He's in town, but I mean, come on.  Not that Clinton would need to go there.  Clinton could have McCartney play in his office if he wanted to. 
[00:54:30]  That's pretty fucking cool, man.  Yeah, we got to give these tickets away somehow.  How are we going to do it?  I don't know, man.  I mean, they want to do solo McCartney stuff.  We don't have to.  We could do anything you guys want.  Look at people, does it include airfare? 
[00:55:00]  Does it include airfare?  Yeah.  No, it does not.  Oh, boy.  Is this a BCN situation all over again?  What can we have them do?  We gave away Super Bowl tickets, but you had to find a way to New Orleans.  Was it New Orleans, too?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  But I think most people would get on a flight for this, right?  And pay?  I would think.  We'll figure out something. 
[00:55:30]  It's still early.  If they could afford it.  We're not giving away tickets to my AC show, though.  No.  No.  No.  They're in high demand.  Come on.  Let's come up with something for the Paul McCartney tickets.  We could have a puke-eating contest.  That was enjoyable.  I don't think...  One of the greatest things we've ever done.  That was so difficult.  How about we ask, like, who was the original drummer from the Beatles?  Oh, that's a tough question.  That's a tough question. 
[00:56:00]  How about...  Because it's got to be somebody...  Let's face it.  It's got to be somebody local.  You know?  We're not going to fucking give these tickets away and have somebody fly in.  If someone wants to fly in.  If someone wants to fly in.  It'll be somebody, like, yeah, I can do it.  And they won't fucking come.  It'll be a wasted ticket.  I'm sure they'll fill the spot.  I'm sure there'll be some kind of, like, you know...  Nah, but...  Line waiting to get in.  How about something where they have to, um...  They have to...  Maybe... 
[00:56:30]  Wear a red hat?  Maybe, like, tweet a picture or something.  Ah.  Locally.  Like, that would have to do with...  Hold on.  Like, yeah?  Yeah?  Yeah?  Oh.  No, you're on to something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking, like...  I'm going to take your idea and I'm going to stamp it, I think.  And...  Let me write this down.  And run with it?  It's not a bad idea, Anthony.  Yeah, but anybody could upload anything.  No, no, no.  That's why I got... 
[00:57:00]  That's why I got an idea.  It's got to be something that proves that they are there at that minute.  Like a ransom with, like, a newspaper.  Exactly.  Some type of ransom.  Watch the Opie and Anthony chemistry, just like Glennon and McCarthy.  Let's...  McCarthy.  I said McCarthy.  I know.  Goddamn communist.  I'm going to take your idea.  Yeah.  Tweet this.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Tweet this.  This.  Okay.  This.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Hold on, hold on.  With this.  Uh-huh.  You know where I'm talking?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  But then tapping Danny's idea with...  I like this idea a lot, Ann.  Very good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I pumped it up. 
[00:58:00]  First person to do that gets a pair of tickets.  It's more of a Lennon thing, though.  Yeah, but...  It is the Beatles, I understand.  But the only question is...  But that's that...  Yeah, yeah.  What if 30 people...  It's the first person to do this one.  First one.  How will we know?  We have to choose a Twitter account.  Somebody's account.  It's got to be the first one that is...  To what?  Us?  Or to you? 
[00:58:30]  Or something like that?  I don't care.  I don't care.  Tweet it to a certain account, and then the first one that shows up as...  Oh, can you do it with...  Danny, can we do it with this?  I like all that.  Dude, I hope that people can hear the...  Shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka, shooka Sharpie.  I don't know, right?  I like Twitter better.  Okay.  It's more immediate.  It's more immediate with timestamps.  Instantaneous.  Okay.  Hold on.  Let's think.  Because that is so...  That's so Beatles. 
[00:59:00]  That's the only reason.  Or how about...  There's something silly, too.  We give...  Yeah, it should be something silly.  We got two pairs, though.  We could do one with this, and then we could do another one.  And how about this, too?  Not first one, because then there'll be somebody who rushes down there.  We give a certain time, and the person that does it closest to that time...  Because then, if it's later in the show, then there'll be a bunch of people there waiting  to snap and...  That might be a little... 
[00:59:30]  You think that's rough?  I think it gives people time to gather.  I love doing creative meetings live.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about this?  Yeah?  This...  This...  Blow off this.  Replace this with a gaping asshole.  No, I don't think that'll work.  It really doesn't serve the purpose that that does.  Or, and this is the N.E.W. Opie speaking... 
[01:00:00]  Uh-oh.  Does that mean we're going to have a lot of time off?  Yes.  Is there a cathedral?  Hey, you weren't complaining.  No.  Oh, God.  Take a picture of this on this.  How much trouble would we get in?  A lot of trouble.  I don't think we'd be going to the show ourselves.  I know, but that's okay.  Wait a minute.  That's a great idea.  The Twitter one's a good idea.  Yeah, yeah.  That...  Anyway, I think we don't have to overthink it. 
[01:00:30]  I think the first person to do this with this, that's a fine little contest.  And you get the local guy.  And then maybe we do one for everybody else.  Yeah, we could do that.  Can we do something silly, though?  They should be doing something silly, too.  Like, they should probably...  Yeah, something should be being done instead of just...  Yeah, like, just make it harder.  Because then if a guy happens to be right there...  This is hard.  Right, right, right.  But the odds of someone happening to be right there is, you know...  But you can get there quick.  This is going to be hard.  Yeah, that's the beauty of it. 
[01:01:00]  The first person that aggressively does this.  That's a big fan of our show and of Paul McCartney.  And it's going to be a photo.  Yeah, I say we go with this one and then try to get a silly one.  What do you think?  You want to use your Twitter account?  No, I don't give a shit.  I don't care either.  I think they should have something else besides the one item.  Besides just that item?  Like, they should have something...  But this is something to do. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, no, no.  They should do that.  But should have something else on?  Yeah, there should just be more to it.  The idea's not bad.  Like what?  Make it a little more difficult.  Just one step more difficult.  Like this.  Like what?  Something silly like this.  Jimmy's going to jot something down here.  Because we could come up with a whole other contest, too.  This is just one that, you know, will get a little buzz going immediately.  Something that they can't just run out and get right now.  Wait, I didn't see. 
[01:02:00]  Something like that as well as...  Something to prove that fans...  Or maybe...  Hey, look.  You want to make it fucking silly?  Because these are real McCartney tickets for the fucking show.  You can't buy these.  Yeah, this is a big-ass deal.  You know, something really stupid.  Someone will do it.  Someone will do it.  And it's funny.  And it's different.  And you want to prove you're a fan and you want to go?  Well, then you're going to act, you know...  I kind of like that.  Yeah, it's not... 
[01:02:30]  It's not...  It's stupid.  But now, what if...  What if...  Oh, okay.  Like, that's not as silly.  Right?  No, no, no.  Good point.  Good point.  Good point.  Okay.  Great, great call.  Let's keep throwing it around the room.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Let's...  Of course.  Let me see.  What?  Oh, God.  Oh, is that why Gary ran down the fucking hall?  Back to your fucking office.  But he might have proved it. 
[01:03:00]  We'll go...  We'll go...  We'll go search you out.  I was wondering why he came running down here.  He likes us.  Whatever.  I like him as a person.  That's not the point.  How about this?  Holy shit.  Is he okay with what we're talking about so far?  Yeah, I'm guessing so.  Is he right in there?  He can't say.  He's got to run it past lawyers, I'm sure.  Oh, God.  What time did they wake up?  What is it?  They haven't yet.  That's my statement. 
[01:03:30]  They haven't yet.  I am so seeing a fucking ninth caller.  I'm so seeing ninth caller.  Why don't we just do that?  Why don't we just do that?  How about...  You could have just stopped with E-Rock says he doesn't know what's going on.  E-Rock is...  You didn't have to continue.  Is he okay with what we're saying so far?  Well, he wants...  He needs to know what you want to do and has to be approved before we can do it.  Well, we're hashing.  Yeah.  We're hashing.  So then we should just do, you know, the basic version of this. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  I'm telling you right now, yes.  I say we give them...  When I want to, actually, to be honest with you, because I would do this.  That is...  I would do this.  Well, we would have done that.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  Or something similar to that.  And then the press for that would have been horrendous.  Oh, awesome.  And we would have been standing outside the Apollo-fired, waving at McCartney.  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  It would have been beautiful.  One more to add to the resume.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  I would love to...  One more chapter to the book. 
[01:04:30]  I would love to listen to the news and see people going, yeah, it's fucking darn terrible.  How about...  How about...  Well, it's 728 now.  We can think about it.  I say we pretty much do that.  Or what you're saying, but something that is a little...  That's not dangerous.  No, no.  We could...  I think we could do that.  That's fine.  Wait till you...  It's our show.  I think that...  I agree with you, but we have the right...  Wait till it goes through the filter.  Well, let's see.  The uncreative, not fun filter. 
[01:05:00]  Let's see.  Or maybe it can be something ridiculous.  Because Ant raised a good point.  What if it's...  Yeah.  Like, and that would be...  That wouldn't be as...  Although you can do that, because it is a two pair of tickets, right?  Yeah.  So if there's a couple, then we can do that.  You know? 
[01:05:30]  The guy would realize, you know, and the girl might be able to help him out with that.  Yeah, but it could easily just be a girl.  Yeah.  It could easily just be a girl.  But how about...  Well, then we have to...  Even if it is a girl.  Even if it is a girl, she's got to bring...  A guy to do that in order to get it.  If it's a guy, he could do that.  If it's a girl, she's got to bring a guy that's doing that.  Mm-hmm.  Huh? 
[01:06:00]  Huh?  Mm-hmm.  Huh?  Mm-hmm.  Huh?  Mm-hmm.  I was going to do it again, but I figured, fuck it.  This is more confusing than math.  No, I know.  We're thinking about it.  Well, I mean, the tickets...  The tickets are special.  Yeah, we don't want to just give them away first.  Yes, Joel.  Someone's got to earn them.  Yep.  Yeah.  But I earned those tickets.  Yes.  Help yourself!  To McCartney tickets.  Help yourself.  Oh, that. 
[01:06:30]  Treat yourself.  Oops.  What would management say?  How about...  Let's go over some song names.  What are some of the big Paul McCartney songs?  Because maybe that is what we...  Oh, my God.  There's, you know, Yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  That is Yesterday. 
[01:07:00]  Mm-hmm.  What's some of them other Paul McCartney songs we got there?  He's a lot.  Say, say, say.  Say, say, say, say.  That song played pretty good.  Hmm.  Ebony and Ivory.  Oh, boy.  The Fugitive just stole the tickets.  It sucks about Ebony and Ivory.  You have to bring Ebony and take a picture somewhere. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, I gotcha.  It's not a bad idea, actually.  You know what we could...  This is probably...  I'll admit ahead of time, this could be, like, morning zoo crap.  Yeah.  But in honor of Ebony and Ivory, you bring a...  Oh, God. 
[01:08:00]  And that's a very New York thing, by the way.  Is it?  Yeah, they don't really...  They don't really dig that in other cities.  Remember, no idea is a bad idea.  Interracial sex.  In a church.  Get it?  Get it?  Well, we're going to have to take a little break, because Z-Rock's going to have to run  down the hall and deal with...  Yeah.  Deal with, you know...  Wow.  Because we're not going to deal with... 
[01:08:30]  That's from Monarchy.  He's got an idea?  No, he nailed yours.  He did?  Yeah.  Fuck, I'm in good company.  I like the Pat Monarchy.  Of course he knows that.  Yeah.  Well, it ain't.  Exactly.  You have to have at least ten toes to be eligible.  This keeps it, you know, as part of his solo career.  Yes, it does.  It does.  And it's kind of goofy.  Not quite goofy enough.  All right.  I want something really...  Something that you're going to feel stupid doing... 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  ...but you're willing to do...  Right.  But it's not ridiculous to the point where you're going to...  It's like you're going to be humiliated, but something stupid that you have to go...  I normally wouldn't do this, but fuck it, it's McCartney ticket.  I changed a fucking...  A Tonight Show fucking peace shoot date to go to this show.  Yeah.  Somebody can do something silly.  How about...  Let us write this word down.  But this is where it'll get into a problem.  Yeah, that's probably...  I hate having to... 
[01:09:30]  I hate having to think like they do.  Oh, my God.  Look at him walking down the hall.  Oh, boy.  Because I'm just having my morning cup of coffee on this casual Friday.  Look at this casual Friday, sir.  Look, I'm casual.  It's Friday and I'm casual.  And I got my morning coffee and I see how he's holding the cup.  There's nothing in the cup.  Because that's how you have to walk around on a casual Friday.  Just having my morning cup of Joe with my casual fucking Friday attire.  Yes.  All right.  How about this? 
[01:10:00]  I don't know if they'll like this.  They have to blow me.  Oh, right.  Imagine if the lawyers approve that.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's fine.  That's fine.  Where...  Kevin from Connecticut says, I'll wear a Die Hard 3 sign at the Apollo.  That's a good one.  Yeah, I was going to say that.  I'll wear you, Chip.  No answer.  All right.  Well, we're going to take a short break. 
[01:10:30]  See what we're allowed to do.  Love here.  Yeah.  Love that I have to say that.  And hopefully we'll have the idea when we come back for the Paul McCartney tickets for  the big show at the Apollo.  Huge show.  It's an exclusive show.  Huge.  Huge.  Not...  You can't really get these tickets.  No.  Where are you getting them?  Where are you getting them?  You've got to win them.  Right?  Of course.  I think so, yeah.  Oh, God.  As soon as we go to break, that door opens with casual Friday Joe. 
[01:11:00]  Fun.  Hey, I don't care.  I got reads to do.  I don't even have to listen.  Can you turn the lights off so he has to talk to us in the dark?  Make believe we're gone?  No.  Just turn the lights off and hide like I used to from my landlord.  Danny, turn off the lights.  I'm serious.  Okay.  He'll talk to us while we're in the dark.  He'll be over in a Patterson's on gambling show.  All right.  We'll have the Paul McCartney contest hopefully next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus. 
[01:11:30]  Sirius XM.  All right. 
[01:12:00]  Take Paul.  Wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Well, we're trying to figure out the Paul McCartney thing.  We will.  It's got to be run up a flagpole.  I don't really know what that means.  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  I never saw a flagpole.  We never really had to run things up a flagpole.  I forgot.  It's a new environment.  It's a new age.  Got to stay positive.  So they're going to run it up a flagpole if they can find the lawyers. 
[01:12:30]  Because it's Paul McCartney.  You know, you've got to keep it classy.  You've got to keep it classy.  Lawyer.  I'm a lawyer.  Ann brought up a good point, though.  Of course.  What?  You went, remember we would just come up with something on the spot and just do it.  It wasn't even a thought to ask anybody.  Sure, that backfired in our face a few times.  I'm not talking about the time where it backfired.  There were hundreds of times.  Hundreds.  Hundreds that it didn't.  It's like we used to go like, hey, how about we get a girl down here and she puts a bottle  rocket in her vagina and shoots it off. 
[01:13:00]  We never ran that up any flagpole.  No, we didn't, sir.  Never ran that up a flagpole.  And did anyone get arrested or fired for that?  No.  No.  The building was a little mad for a day or two.  They got over it.  Yep.  The bitch is fucking shooting eggs out her vagina.  Was that run up a flagpole?  Nope.  A girl smoked out of her vagina.  Remember that?  That was fantastic.  How about the trying to get a cell phone to ring inside a vagina?  Inside a vagina.  We didn't have to run that up no flagpole.  I'm noticing a trend with all these things, though.  Vagina usually involved.  All right.  Well, we'll go with the naked bloody girl being rushed out of the building. 
[01:13:30]  That was a good one, too.  That wasn't run up no flagpole.  No.  There were no problems after that incident.  The flagpole.  What is the flagpole?  Is that corporate stuff?  Blind boxing, even.  Blind boxing wasn't run up no flagpole.  We just decided, let's do this.  There were some severe injuries, but no one was sued.  No one died.  Yeah.  It wasn't run up the flagpole.  Run up the flagpole to be greenlit.  No. 
[01:14:00]  Blue sky.  Blue sky.  Blue sky.  It's got to be blue sky.  We've got to take it to management and see if it's blue sky.  So they're going to run it up the flagpole.  Yeah.  So.  Great.  And then.  Does anything ever make it to the top of the flagpole?  I think our flag.  It gets halfway up and then just.  Our flagpole is at half mass.  It's always at half mass.  Things get run up the flagpole.  It's just that there's like 25 people shooting it with a shotgun at the same time.  It just never makes it.  It always ends up the bit dies and it's at half mass. 
[01:14:30]  We've had a lot of bits die before it made it to the top of the flagpole.  Very sad.  Trust me.  Or it comes down a different flag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, wait, this doesn't even resemble the flag we ran up in.  What is.  It's a communist flag now.  Happened.  Got to keep it fun, though.  They don't want to.  Keep it fun.  They don't want to hear us bitching.  Good clean fun.  Good clean fun.  We're just in a tough spot.  We remember when.  Yeah.  So it makes it tough to live in this new environment. 
[01:15:00]  Memories.  If the people are listening that are going to yell and scream at me today.  Yes.  I.  By the way, yelling and screaming doesn't work.  No.  No, it doesn't.  We'll figure it out.  Just brings me back to growing up in my mom's house.  We'll figure it out.  I go blank if you start yelling.  I saw a commercial for the.  No, you didn't.  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  You didn't?  What?  It was for the.  Before I got up this morning, it was for the Chris Angel magic kit. 
[01:15:30]  Did you see that one?  I have.  Oh, it's so douchey.  He used to be a friend of the show, though.  I know.  But dude.  He used to love us.  It's so incredibly douchey.  The commercial.  Be the.  My favorite part was the loser guy at the party.  They show this guy he's at a party, and he's got all his Chris Angel magic tricks, and there's  nothing but hot chicks on the couch around him, and he does a trick, and for no reason  whatsoever, one hot chick leans over and just kisses the guy. 
[01:16:00]  Really?  Like you did this magic trick, and you're supposed to be this guy that's watching this going,  so if I get the magic thing at a party, because he goes, it's a great icebreaker, and he does  a trick, and this chick leans over, this blonde, and just kisses him.  Oh, because that's what it takes?  And that's all it takes.  A little magic?  I watched it, and I was like, oh my god, this is so douchey.  And then Chris Angel is there, and he's got the box that the magic thing comes in, and  he makes it levitate into his hand.  It's like, learn levitation!  Can you do that, too? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You think you could do that, or that was part of the pitch?  No.  No, I think that was a string on the box, and he was making it look like that.  Oh, you can't really levitate things?  No.  No.  No.  No.  But I saw that, and I was like, you know, I, oh, somebody actually has it as a goof.  Did they make a good job putting their mark on this?  This looks awesome.  All right, you'll find a good part.  This looks awesome.  Yeah, guys, checking out the magic.  The Chris Angel magic set. 
[01:17:00]  It reminds me of this other magician years and years ago.  Pat from Monaki might know this.  Magic Bob?  Magic Bob.  Yeah, I know, because that's why I even brought it up, because I could totally see Magic Bob  buying this, so he could just get new tricks.  But there used to be a deck of cards, and a magician would sell it on TV, on like Channel  11 locally here in New York, and it was, he was a very cheesy fucking magician, and he 
[01:17:30]  would sell these cards, and it was so obvious, because some of the cards are just a little  smaller than the other ones.  Oh, really?  So you'd shuffle it one way?  Was it Blackstone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good, Pat from Monaki.  How does Pat know all this stuff?  I know Pat watches, he watched as much television as I did.  Okay.  And, yeah, so he knows.  And some of the cards would be short, shorter than the others, so you'd shuffle the cards,  and then when you flip them, the cards, every other card is flipping off of the bigger 
[01:18:00]  one, so it looks like they're all the same suit or the same card, and then you turn the  deck around.  That's how they do that?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a trick deck.  It's a trick deck.  It's like shit.  You know when a magician has just lost it, when they put out some of their tricks to the  public?  Yes, E-Rock.  Blackstone used to also do the ball with the cup trick, and they cut the rope to make it  longer and shorter.  Right, right.  Cutting the rope, but you knot it, and then cut it, and the knot slides off the rope.  I still don't know how they do that. 
[01:18:30]  I don't either, but it's, you know, you could buy it.  I was doing magic one time.  I had doves appearing.  How'd you do that?  I had a birdcage.  I would just pull the cover off it.  Oh, so it wasn't a trick.  It was just a birdcage with birds, and you let the birds out.  Yeah, but I was shaking up real bad first.  Oh, he's willing to get his hands dirty.  Now the prestige.  I just saw that, and I did really, it was really fun. 
[01:19:00]  If we're talking magic, can I clear something up?  Magic.  I posted a video of Fast Eddie, who Jimmy knows from the old days.  He's a magician.  And I just want to make it perfectly clear that Fast Eddie's not a pedo.  Thank you.  Oh, Jesus.  Where did that come?  Fast Eddie?  No.  We were at a party, and he likes doing magic at all these parties.  He's part of my family now.  My sister married into his family.  Oh.  And he was doing some tricks in front of a lot of young girls.  Yay.  Because it was a high school graduation party. 
[01:19:30]  I've got to explain this.  Yeah.  Because I'm getting killed.  And Fast Eddie's wearing his horrible hairpiece, and he's doing magic in front of these really  young girls.  Yeah.  And I just want to clear that up.  Sounds fun.  He's a very nice guy, and he's not a kid toucher.  I can't believe I have to actually say this.  That kind of sounds like a good time.  People were confused, because there's just nothing but very hot young girls in the video.  Were they impressed at the prestidigitation? 
[01:20:00]  They're like, how did you do that?  Anything worse?  Yeah, there was anything worse than that fucking accent.  Yeah, there was a couple of those on the Criss Angel magic kit commercial, too.  Hot girls?  Yeah, hot young girls just going, this is crazy.  Yeah.  With too much eye makeup on and shit?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's great.  The Platinum Magic Kit.  For the first time ever, learn the secrets of magic from Criss Angel. 
[01:20:30]  Wow, the box is just in mid-air.  That's some magic right there.  Oh, yeah, 250 tricks.  The Floating Bill.  Turn the sound up a little bit for a second.  He makes salt appear out of his hand, and everyone's freaked out.  They're all actors, by the way.  They're all actors.  Bad actors, of course.  You can be a mind freak, too.  These are the most amazing tricks ever.  It's the best icebreaker.  What was your call?  Look, look, watch.  The three of hearts. 
[01:21:00]  Look, watch.  You made the three of hearts appear.  I didn't do this for myself.  Oh, no one would kiss you.  Dude, if you brought your magic shit to a bar, they would laugh at you.  And the hottest blonde in the room is, like, kissing him.  Who the fuck would kiss you?  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  And they got the worst actors, huh?  Yeah, really bad.  Have the perfect icebreaker.  These tricks are awesome.  Call now to get the award-winning person to be the best.  That's teach.  He's got braces on.  These tricks are awesome.  Yeah.  I make girls disappear when I talk. 
[01:21:30]  I smile, and I make knuckles get bloodied.  Hey, man, if you were growing up, though, that'd be kind of cool.  But, I mean, the guy that obviously is in his mid-to-upper 20s in a club doing magic tricks,  that's, wow.  No, that's not going to get you girls.  Yeah, yeah.  Get the Criss Angel Platinum Magic Kit and the bonus How to Levitate DVD.  I bet she's so in the ship.  Two payments of $14.99.  Here's how to order.  I think we should buy one.  The levitate, we really should buy one. 
[01:22:00]  The levitation trick is so fucking fake.  Like, they use camera tricks with it.  There's a way you do it where you just stand on one toe, and you keep your feet together  and pull your heels off the ground.  Yeah, that's the angle.  And you're just, you're up on one toe.  It's hard to do.  That's the angle.  And, like, if you do it at the right angle, it looks good.  It looks good, yeah.  Because you put your toe in the air and your heel in the air, and then it's how it's filmed.  No, but it's also, they have special pants that literally what he does.  Seriously, you know this?  Yes, he has, his pants and shoe are attached, and what, oh, right, right, I've seen that. 
[01:22:30]  And the front leg will be lifted out of the front of the pants.  Yeah.  And he, I think, stands up like that or something, and the pants stay levitated.  I forget how he does it, but it has something to do with pulling his leg out of the front  of his pants.  Yeah.  And the shoe is attached to the pants, so it looks like he's levitating, but his leg  is actually extending the front.  He's using that leg to, oh, wow.  I've seen that one explained.  Like, David Blaine does that one really well.  Yeah.  That's the first time I saw it. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, but they use camera tricks.  They'll do that, but then they'll show his feet off the ground.  Which is a complete cutaway.  It's a cutaway.  He's just on a pull-up bar, and he's off the ground, and then they show him dropping  to the ground, another cutaway, and they have reactions of people watching.  Like, you could have people reacting to watching Two Girls, One Cup, and going like, oh, oh,  and freaking out.  And meanwhile, they're not even watching his tricks.  So it's all fucking camera shit and some, like, cheesy fucking...  Oh, you mean the reaction shots could be something else? 
[01:23:30]  Totally different.  Is this him showing how it, uh...  See, there's a platform in front of him.  All right.  So he pulls his leg out.  I mean, it's physically, I would guess, a little taxing to do this.  I'm talking to them, saying, stay right there.  I'm taking my left hand, removing the panel, and when I come back around, I just pull it  apart so it's done.  He's actually showing.  Now I'm ready.  Pull his cock out.  Pull his cock out.  Take my leg right out.  Remember, it's important to create some misdirection. 
[01:24:00]  You don't want them concentrating on your legs at this point.  You want them looking elsewhere so that you can do the dirty work.  So fart.  Probably the most difficult part.  So look at your butt cheeks.  To get your leg out and planted, and then to get your leg back in.  This is where you really need to be slick.  So when you're in this position, I usually just bring my hands forward while I come and  get everything to position.  Now his leg is out.  Now the next phase of this is just literally to balance yourself, as we discussed before, 
[01:24:30]  and just create the illusion and presentation that you're going to float.  Arch your back.  Look up in the air.  Yes.  Bring your hands up and be.  He's so magical.  And now you've got to keep your heel.  That's all it is.  That's all it is.  That looks silly.  I never saw this, to be honest with you.  Look, he's flying.  How does it look?  But he's good.  It looks right.  You can either float up to the top, or you can float back down, and you get your foot  back in.  But if you float to the top, you can float up to the top. 
[01:25:00]  Boom.  And this is the position you land.  How do you get your foot back in?  Your foot actually lands on top of the shoe.  How awkward if you can't get your foot back in?  You're just talking to people?  This is obviously the most difficult technique and effect to do, which I did on a sidewalk,  and I also did in a bar.  That looks fucking good.  That's pretty cool.  That did look pretty good.  How did they get there, Danny?  That's on YouTube.  You can just put Chris Angel Levitation.  Okay.  You can see what we just saw.  I like Chris.  People hate when we watch TV, but if you watch it yourself later, then it all makes sense. 
[01:25:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  But when I saw that, I just thought of Magic Bob is probably ordering that.  Oh, I'm sure he is.  Dude, send me one, dude.  I'm sure he is.  Bob was funny, wasn't he?  He was so matching.  Very funny.  With his stupid mask on.  And he was trying to be all flamboyant with his hands and everything.  That was very funny.  Magic Bob.  Magic Bob stunk.  I know.  The video came out shitty because Magic Bob needed all the lights out.  The lights out.  I love the fact that he made Sam take his shirt off. 
[01:26:00]  I know.  For no reason, except he loves having Sam with his shirt off.  Who doesn't?  Oh, I know.  Hey, really quick.  LeBron James made his return to Cleveland.  He certainly did.  It was unbelievable, man.  Yes.  And then he shut up the Cleveland crowd and kind of showed why he left.  Because he was the entire team.  Cleveland has a really bad basketball team.  Really bad.  He was the whole team.  He scored 38, and I don't even think he played the fourth quarter.  Did they blow him?  Oh, boy, did they. 
[01:26:30]  It was funny because I think it was on TNT.  They couldn't really acknowledge that the chant was asshole when he came out on the floor.  The entire crowd just going, asshole.  Yeah, that one.  Asshole.  That one's a fave.  I like that.  And then someone was very clever.  They started a Twitter account.  I think it was called Cav Chants or something like that.  And I think, if I read this properly, people at the game were waiting for this guy's Twitter account to tweet what the next chant was. 
[01:27:00]  So everyone knew what to start chanting.  So everyone was on the same page.  That was pretty cool.  And some of the chants were like, Akron hates you.  Akron hates you, his hometown.  Scotty Pippen.  You know, the big one they probably left out.  Oh, yeah.  Awful.  There was supposed to be a Dante, a West Chan.  I don't know if that ever happened because I gave up when they sat him in the fourth quarter.  I was done with the game.  But, yeah, he just kicked ass last night.  He scored 38 points without playing the fourth quarter.  24 points in the third.  Did they cheer him at all?  Hell, fucking no. 
[01:27:30]  No cheering.  He is so hated.  That's got to hurt on some level.  Because they explained that this guy was loved in every arena in the NBA.  And now pretty much every arena except for Miami and maybe a few places here and there just don't like the guy now.  They really feel like they did this.  Because of the way he left, right?  And all the analysts and everybody are all saying it was just the way he did it.  They understand he has every right to do it.  They all will say that.  But they think the way he did is what is the big problem here.  The side of a building has your giant picture on it and everybody in that city has seen it. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  Everyone that visited that city saw that fucking thing.  Right.  That's pretty big when you leave.  Yeah.  People are going to be a little angry.  And people were tweeting from the game and I really appreciate it.  They said the best sign or t-shirt was like father, like son.  That's brutal.  Who is his father?  He doesn't know.  As in he left and LeBron left.  Like father, like son.  And then another one that said LeBron went south and his mom is riding west. 
[01:28:30]  He had to see this shit.  And as much as he was putting on a happy face and all that, as a human, you got to think it bothers him a bit.  Oh, it's got to.  Got to.  But he shut him down, man.  In the end, he just shut him down.  The energy left the place because the Cavs were getting their ass kicked.  They played well in the first quarter.  They made it a game of the first, but then it was over after that.  Yeah, they were probably none too happy with them being beaten like that. 
[01:29:00]  They would have liked to have seen him choke or lose or be distracted, but apparently he had one of his best games.  And I chose to do that instead of see the Islanders lose another game.  Why bother?  I gave these tickets away, but the next set, sorry.  I'm only giving away every other set of tickets.  And the other one's just going to the pile?  Well, I mean, I made the video where I threw them out the window, even though people think it's fake.  Get destroyed.  Think what you want.  The next one, I think, is from the top of a building.  Fake, fake, totally fake.  Yeah.  I guess I'm printing up tickets at home, man, is what they're saying. 
[01:29:30]  Is that it?  Are you scanning them and printing and counterfeiting?  I'm printing up tickets.  That's what I'm doing.  All right.  Because it's on shitty paper.  But that's the point I'm trying to make.  They don't even give you a nice ticket.  Like other places, I've been to hockey games.  They give you the nice, big, fucking thick ticket.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah, it's like cardboard.  It's like, here's my ticket to the game.  I got a half a season.  They're embossed.  Yes.  They have gold.  They got a seal on it.  Really nice.  Holograms on them and shit.  All that shit.  Yeah.  And I got a half a season.  They mailed me my tickets. 
[01:30:00]  On toilet paper.  They're on regular, I'm going to see Molly Hatchet type tickets.  You know what I mean?  Molly Hatchet.  With the, I forgot what the logo is on the back.  I have to look again.  What, Ticketmaster or whatever logo on the back.  Just shitty.  That's it.  That's all.  Yeah.  The presentation all around just sucks.  Waste even going.  Paul McCartney, are we going to just make it simple?  I think, why not?  Go with your idea.  I think we should.  Use that with that.  Yeah.  And not overthink it at this point because we're, you know.  Yeah.  We have to give these away. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, I think we should.  So can we run that up the flagpole officially?  Get that, get that idea.  Yeah.  Ant's idea with mine, and actually Danny helped out with the twist with the, here it is.  So it would be first person here, which is obviously that, with that so we know it's  happening today.  Just that?  That's it.  First one to tweet it to one of our accounts.  We'll figure it out.  That should be incredibly easy.  Send it to yours.  Really? 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I think I'm going to follow you for that.  Look what I do now.  I don't need to.  I follow fucking Anthony.  I don't need to have, like.  Actually, I don't want it either because now it's just going to clog up my shit.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't want my shit clogged up.  I don't want my shit clogged.  I see what you're doing.  I don't want my shit clogged.  You actually weren't being nice.  You didn't want your shit clogged up.  What are you, sniffing?  Yeah.  Bad?  No, not really.  I'm not barking. 
[01:31:30]  Wow, that fucking shut down the show.  The Paul McCartney flagpole casual Friday.  It's now it's got to be.  Empty coffee cup thing.  Empty coffee cup mini meeting.  Mini meeting.  And there's so much I want to say, but I realize, A, the listeners are sick of it, and B, every  time we do it, we get yelled at.  The last thing I need is a.  But a few of the things that were said during the break, it's just.  The last thing I need is a Friday meeting.  That ain't happening.  The last thing I need is a meeting, like one of those where they go, can we just have 
[01:32:00]  a couple of minutes?  That ain't happening.  No!  Nope.  Good news, it's Hanukkah, so most of the Jews aren't even here.  Are the Jews celebrating Hanukkah?  Do they take that off?  Is there an off time?  Do they start Hanukkah in November this year?  What's wrong with these people?  Sometimes it's very early.  Sometimes it's very late.  Sometimes it's January.  How about you do it in the middle of December when everyone's in the same spirit?  I don't know what constitutes the beginning or end of Hanukkah.  I don't know what, like why does it start sometimes?  I don't know. 
[01:32:30]  Because it's a made up holiday, I think.  It's a floating holiday.  Yeah, why does it float?  You can't have a floating holiday.  Like Christmas is the 25th.  I guess there are floating holidays technically, but it's within a day.  They float this holiday within a month range.  Well, Thanksgiving is weird because it's like the last Thursday or something.  So that floats around.  That's stupid.  But Hanukkah, why isn't Hanukkah on the same day of December every year?  That's my question to Jew.  I get it? 
[01:33:00]  My question to you, but it's my question to Jew.  Feeling pretty good.  La la la la.  No.  How many candles in are we with the Hanukkah thing?  What are we?  One candle in?  One candle in.  And then at sundown, what are they, light another candle?  Well, it started, what, Wednesday?  What?  We live among the Jews.  We don't even know what they're doing.  Tonight is third candle.  Third candle at sundown?  Yeah.  They're very secretive.  We don't even know what they're doing.  They are very secretive.  You live in a neighborhood of Jews. 
[01:33:30]  I know.  Do you see candles lit?  I should look in more of the windows for menorahs, but I wing into my driveway.  I don't look at anything.  I look at my beautiful Christmas lights.  That of festoon, the front of my house.  Festoon.  Yes.  My house is festooned in festivity.  That's not on my word of the day calendar.  And I get a nice, good big load of wood during that monsoon that we had the other day.  Soaked. 
[01:34:00]  Soaked.  Fuck.  So now I had a beautiful smolder in the fireplace last night.  It was a great smolder.  And we all learned how much you like your fire and poking at it.  I love my fire and poking at it.  Couldn't poke the fire once.  Anything worse than wet wood?  It's a smolder.  There's no way to...  We're doing our wood jokes.  It's my wood jokes.  I wonder why.  Because then I heard this story on the news where a wire came down and hit some wood and  it burst into flames. 
[01:34:30]  I'm like, what the fuck, man?  Wet wood will burn when it's your fucking house.  Sure.  Your house is in the pouring rain.  Sure.  And that's burning like a motherfucker if you have a house fire.  But I put a log in there with 8,000 degrees of log starters and paper and everything else.  And it's engulfed in flames for three minutes.  And then it's smoldering.  Right.  I just get like wood.  I look at my fucking chimney and it looks like fucking Treblinka.  There's just black smoke coming out of the top.  Looks like I'm electing a pope.  Ah, I was going to go with that. 
[01:35:00]  I swear to you.  I was just waiting for you to finish.  It's horrible.  Fuck.  I wanted to say that.  The pope line.  Yeah.  I don't have many lines.  That was a good one.  I would have had that one.  It's terrible.  What about when your wood is green?  Oh, green wood sucks because that...  But it looks like it's perfect wood for a fire and all of a sudden you put it in and  it's like, oh no, this wood's green.  It doesn't work.  It's green.  The wood's got to be seasoned.  What the fuck is that?  I hate that.  I like a nice big fire.  Blackened or salt and pepper?  Ah, I like that pepper. 
[01:35:30]  I like a blackened.  Yeah?  I like my shit blackened.  I've taken to starting cooking myself.  I've been cooking a little bit.  I do.  Nice.  All I'd make, though, is a full seven-pound chicken.  It's all I ever make.  That's the best, though.  It's great.  Well, you'd cook that chicken for about, what is it, 45 minutes? 
[01:36:00]  No, that's long, right?  An hour?  An hour and a half?  It's almost, yeah, just short of two hours.  Why seven pounds, though?  Who are you feeding?  Just me for a few days.  Do you eat the legs?  Yeah.  You know, you rip the legs off.  It's all about the white breast meat.  Breast meat.  It's really nice.  I'm going to have to make one of those tonight.  Good shit.  Good shit.  Ah, that's what's with, like, winter stuff.  Winter stuff is, I've got to find things to do in the winter.  Make a stew.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Beef stew in the winter? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  With a brown broth?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Brown broth.  No fucking way.  Is this true?  Kyle in Boston.  Kyle.  Kyle.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I just saw on the news, or on my phone, I can't open the article, so I don't have any details,  but the guy that got hit by the ice cream truck in that video you interviewed is a murder  suspect right now.  We talked to that guy.  We had him on the phone.  He was cool.  Of course he's a murder suspect. 
[01:37:00]  Did you see the video?  I could tell he was a murder suspect.  Is he a murder suspect before or after he got hit by the ice cream truck?  Is it an old murder?  I think, like, very recently.  Murder is the case they gave me.  Shit.  Seriously?  Yeah.  That's just breaking?  First 48?  What is it?  Cold case files?  Wow, that's something.  Did you see my Bruins put on a clinic last night?  What was it?  8-1, I think?  8-1, baby.  I'm taking a peek at the Bruins.  They might become my team for the second half of the season. 
[01:37:30]  I'm officially picking a team for the second half of the season.  And I can't go hack.  I can't go Rangers.  I can't go Devils.  That's too local.  I think I want to pick a team out of the blue.  Yeah.  Like, maybe the Red Wings.  A team I would never follow and don't know much about.  And that'll be your team.  For the second half of the season, yes.  Oh, you're going second half season, new team.  Which is coming soon, I believe.  If that isn't the best bandwagon jumper ever.  Well, hey, man, the players do it.  We started this last year. 
[01:38:00]  Why can't fans be free agents and pick new teams?  You stick with your team.  You're fair weather fans.  The shit I'm getting from Islanders fans because I threw my tickets out the window.  Way to support the team.  I'm like, when they take it serious again, I'll support them.  You think the team isn't taking it seriously?  Hell fucking no.  The GM's got to go.  I question if the owner even knows what the fuck he's doing.  And then you've got the politicians involved that don't even give a shit that the team is still on Long Island. 
[01:38:30]  So, hell fucking no.  Don't get me started.  What's up, Jimmy?  Something's going on with you.  Nothing bad.  No, no, I'm thinking of...  Did you hear the ice cream guy is a murder suspect?  I did not, no.  Yeah, he just came back in.  That guy's up for a murder.  Trying to get the whole story.  Although, Kyle might be just...  Which ice cream guy?  That got hit by the ice cream truck?  The guy that was doing a little dance thing.  We talked to him on the air.  Yeah.  He was doing a little dance thing and he walked out and the ice cream truck hit him.  Yeah.  And didn't kill him, which is amazing.  He's a suspect in a murder?  Rumor has it right now.  We're getting initial reports. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, where...  That he was murdered or he's a suspect?  No, that he's a suspect.  Kyle, so far we can't find any info on that.  Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about?  It was like...  I got the link off the site to ABC News.  It was on their video section.  I just can't open the videos on my phone.  ABC News where?  In what city?  It was just like the main ABC News site.  Oh, really?  I got the link off a local site.  Actually, you know those LeBron shirts that you were talking about?  Going south, riding west? 
[01:39:30]  Uh-huh.  It was off the Boston Sports website.  It's a link to ABC News.  Okay.  Hey, Bruins doing well?  Yeah, but we still got...  Well, Mark Survive's coming back this week, so we just had to dump two guys to make some  cap room, but...  This is what I'm going to do.  Second half of the season.  When does the second half of the season officially start?  January?  Mid-January, maybe?  Probably January.  And I will pick a team that's...  It has to be over 500.  I have to have someone that has at least... 
[01:40:00]  That's already just...  That has to have a shot.  And I'm not going to go with a front runner.  Not going to go with an easy choice, no.  Why not?  Kind of a middle-of-the-pack team with an above 500 record.  You should just go with a front runner.  Nah, because I don't want to be that much of a...  All-in.  A bandwagon guy.  You've got to either not do it or be all-in with a front runner.  And then maybe I'll make a video dramatically removing my Islanders jersey and putting on that  jersey.  No, you throw it out the window and it gets caught on somebody's hood. 
[01:40:30]  They have a fucking three-car collision.  They careen into an abutment.  You see a little pair of shoes fly out of a car window.  The little pair of shoes.  There's nothing worse than a pair of child shoes flying out of a car window.  Patent leather buckled shoes.  You know you're in Dutch.  All right, Kyle.  Thanks for the knowledge there.  Thanks for the maybe...  Maybe news.  ...lie.  All right.  Did you run that up the flagpole?  It is in the process of being attached to the flagpole. 
[01:41:00]  It's being attached first and then somebody's got to...  I guess the running...  It might be being run right now.  I have no idea.  Yeah, it could be running up.  We'll see what happens.  You've got an eye on the hallway.  Oh, boy, do I.  This is good.  We've got overlapping fields of vision.  Yeah, you've got that hallway covered.  I've got that hallway and there.  Why do you think I...  You've got this.  Why do you think the studio is set up this way?  It's because they can't sneak up on it.  That's right.  We see them coming a mile away.  Yeah.  We've got the studio that has the 80-foot-long hallway.  So it takes it forever to come down that hall. 
[01:41:30]  And then the sneak attack you got, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I've got the sneak attack from this side.  You see them coming around that corner, don't you?  Oh, yeah.  They don't get past me.  No.  No way.  Nah.  I've got to take a leak.  Yeah, I haven't taken a piss.  I usually don't all day, but I ran out of the house this morning.  I didn't take a leak.  So I really got to go.  Howie Mandel's calling in.  Really?  Oh, and he's part of one of my favorite shows.  Which one?  No joke.  For some reason, I love...  St. Elsewhere?  Was he on St. Elsewhere?  I think he was, wasn't he? 
[01:42:00]  Was he?  I have no idea.  America's Got Talent.  I just like that show.  And he was a great replacement for the Huff.  A great replacement.  Pat from Monaki says he was on St. Elsewhere.  Really?  Yes, Pat from Monaki.  Ty Mandel, yes.  The amazing Pat from Monaki.  I didn't watch that show.  I didn't either, but I remember him from it.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, I do know that.  I guess I do know that.  Is...  What?  Kurt here?  And Kurt will be in studio next.  Where is he?  You know Kurt?  I know Kurt for years, yeah.  Okay, we'll have him in next.  Where is he, though? 
[01:42:30]  He was not in the offices.  I don't know.  I'm here.  I haven't seen him.  Oh.  You're here?  And Jackie's coming by again to say hi, so...  Yeah.  We'll be here a little later.  Cool.  Can we take leaks?  Yes.  Leaky.  And hopefully when we get back, it's been an hour now, we're trying to give away these  Paul McCartney tickets.  So hopefully we'll have an answer.  Up the flagpole.  If that doesn't go up the flagpole, then we'll just take a dumb fucking number caller.  Yes.  All right?  All right. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  A couple things.  That last listener was wrong.  Danny, you want to explain?  Long story short, that caller clicked a link from like a sports blog, and if you just would 
[01:43:30]  have read the caption, it was obviously not ice cream truck guy.  It was just some guy, and for whatever reason, whoever runs this sports blog linked to the  picture and said, check out this murder suspect who may or may not be the motherfucker above.  Oh, okay.  So it's not, it's completely unrelated.  It's two different people.  It's completely unrelated.  So thanks again, listeners.  You're O forever.  Always, always just so accurate. 
[01:44:00]  No, they're not.  I have hope in them.  Do you?  I continue to have hope.  Wow.  Lost hope.  And then the other thing, Derek came up with a great idea for the Paul McCartney tickets.  Yeah, he did.  And we definitely want to run this up the flagpole.  Let's run it up the flagpole and see if it's allowed.  We have another idea for the flagpole, Danny, if you can run down the hall or somebody else,  okay?  Does Derek want to say it himself?  I think it's brilliant.  Aw, shit.  Look what I got.  And of course, we got Pop-Tarts in there.  Oh, toasted cinnamon. 
[01:44:30]  Ooh, that's so brilliant.  God, those are so knock on the floor-able.  I know.  Hiding them over here.  Brown sugar.  Just for me.  Brown sugar.  What's the idea?  I want Derek to say it because it's his idea.  It's fucking great.  I just want to say, run it up the flagpole.  I want to, yeah, see what is said.  Why does this keep kicking me off the fucking network?  Because it doesn't like you, James.  At least there's a reason.  D-boy.  What's up, brother?  What's going on?  Well, why don't you just throw it out there?  This is not what we're doing because we have to run it up the corporate flagpole and hope 
[01:45:00]  it gets blue-skied after they bake it for a little while and maybe throw it between a  couple buckets.  Right.  I think that the first listener who brings down a wooden leg should win the second pair  of tickets.  A wooden leg!  Just like his dumb wife.  Exactly.  Yes.  Well, I have a feeling there's going to be an issue.  Do you think?  I like the idea a lot.  Let's run it up the flagpole.  Let's run it up the flagpole.  Submit it.  Are we officially running it up the flagpole? 
[01:45:30]  Offer it up.  Who goes down the hall?  Who goes down and has to submit?  Who's the guinea pig that has to deal with that shit?  Who's going to go down and hear no immediately?  Flagpole.  No, flagpole it.  Flagpole!  That's something we would have done in the past without even running up the flagpole.  And people would have laughed and laughed and then they would have got to see a terrific  show.  Right.  There's nothing wrong with that idea.  It's not outrageous.  We've done way worse.  Someone flagpole it.  Flagpole!  D-Boy, you flagpolling?  I guess I'll be flagpolling.  Wow, he's taking his own idea to flagpole it.  Who do I got to go see, Gary? 
[01:46:00]  Wait till you see how it comes down.  Where's his office at anyways?  I never go down there.  The one that they kicked Rob Cross out of.  Oh, okay.  Why did they kick Rob out of his office?  I don't know.  Because the mashup needed room.  I don't know.  They play musical chairs in the hallway all the time.  That's great.  They should just take our office.  We don't use it.  He's going to put the flagpole up and it's going to come down like the one that was at  the ground zero.  Jesus.  Jesus.  He's just all fucked up.  Hey, Kurt is outside.  Kurt Metzger. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, he is.  Bring him in, man.  Kurt's a very funny comic.  We met already.  Yeah.  We all had our dicks in our hands.  I guess we got to admit that we were bitching about management and all of a sudden Kurt goes,  this is awkward.  I just want to say hi.  I'm going to be doing your show in about a minute.  Like, oh.  We all got our dicks in our hands.  I didn't want to make it awkward later.  But Ant made it really awkward because there were four stalls.  You were on the left stall.  Yeah, I fucked it up.  You fucked it up so bad.  I fucked it up.  But then I think I fucked it up because you didn't take the far right stall.  I should have went way long. 
[01:47:00]  You went so...  There's dividers though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Unfortunately, I hate those things.  You can drill through those.  Jimmy's always putting holes in them, yeah.  Long story short, then I had a pee in between Kurt and Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you went to the far one, then I would have to pick who I wanted to pee in my buffer.  I was actually taking...  I should have went stall, though.  I was taking the option out of your hands, so you didn't have to decide, who am I going  to piss next to?  See?  I shot the hostage.  The proper non-homo move would have been to do the urinal to your right, because then 
[01:47:30]  I'm only next to one guy.  I should have went long.  I failed, and I peed in front of two guys when I could have only had to pee in front  of one guy.  And actually, the real answer is to fucking take the stall at that point and not pee in  front of any guys next to you.  True.  True.  It's a math problem every time you go into the bathroom.  You understand.  Yeah.  The hard part is I take so long to piss.  I literally...  Me and Florentine were at Ozzy on Wednesday, and there's a packed bathroom, so we're talking  and I'm standing there. 
[01:48:00]  Sorry.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I really...  I should have done that.  Hold on.  No.  What?  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Well, Derek came running back, and I thought he had good news.  Breaking news.  Derek is back.  He ran it up the flagpole.  Your idea for the Paul McCartney tickets.  Let us know what happened.  First person to come by with a wooden leg.  It's a brilliant idea.  It's a great radio idea.  They said no.  Wait, wait.  It didn't even go up the flagpole.  It didn't even go up there.  It was marched out to the flagpole, and then somebody marched it right back in.  They didn't even take it out of the case. 
[01:48:30]  They were just like, fuck it.  What's the idea?  For McCartney, the SiriusXM is putting on a...  He's got McCartney doing the Apollo.  It's like a really special show to celebrate.  20 million listeners.  Tickets are completely unavailable.  Right.  So we have a couple of tickets, two pairs or whatever, to give away.  And we're trying to think of, because we had two weeks with this, and we did nothing.  So we're trying to think of something to do last minute.  And we've come up with really not good ideas.  And Derek had an idea, which was very funny.  Yes, very funny.  But we all knew. 
[01:49:00]  We all knew.  It's a perfect idea.  But McCartney, no one can say to McCartney, yeah, hey, Paul, sit down.  Great idea.  But we know that.  He'll never know.  Thank you, Anthony.  He would never know.  We're never going to be on his radar.  We're not on Paul McCartney's fucking radar.  That's not true.  Is he going to do that awful Starbucks coffee fucking album that he had?  Ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding.  Everybody going to sing him?  Everybody going to sing him?  Yeah, we were just going to put on that.  We hate that.  I'm a huge Beatles-McCartney fan, but not so much with the mandolin thing.  Yeah, I'm not a fan of that. 
[01:49:30]  Not a fan of that.  I'm just going to scream, let it be, until he sings it.  I'm going to scream, let it be, through my cupped hands.  Fuck it.  And Aussie songs.  Now, he didn't even run it up the flagpole.  And that's why the frustration from me, that's where it all comes from.  Well, he actually met me.  He thinks it's just a crazy idea, right?  It's insane to even think that, right?  Yeah, he just walked to the door before I even got there, and was like, no.  But it's not up to him.  His job is to run shit up to the lawyers. 
[01:50:00]  We want it flagpolled.  We want it flagpolled.  We want it flagpolled.  That seat, he can't make creative decisions for his fucking show.  His job is to run it up the flagpole.  So go back down there.  Flagpole it!  And tell him to open it and say you want it, Ren.  Ah, shit, here it comes.  Is he going to come on the air?  Ah, shit, here it comes.  Run it up the flagpole.  Ah, shit, swim off.  He's still holding a call.  Someone's been exercising.  Hold on, Kenny, I asked Kenny for coffee and it hasn't come yet.  So it looks like somebody's fired.  He's still walking around. 
[01:50:30]  He's waving.  He's still walking around with his coffee.  They can't be drinking that much coffee.  No one drinks that much coffee on Casual Friday.  He came in a very weird day.  Oh, today's Casual Friday?  Yes, it is.  Yes, yes.  You've got the proper Casual Friday outfit on there.  It's where people in management pretend that they're not fucking ready to slit their own throats  under the pressure.  Flagpole.  Flagpole.  Where's he going?  Where is he?  Where is he going?  Flagpole.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  He went to make the turn to go into the little producer's studio there. 
[01:51:00]  And he stopped behind the curtain.  And he stopped.  He pulled his phone out and went straight.  So he's flagpole.  It'd be great if he was taking a cock photo behind the curtain.  His job is not to decide on our creative shit.  It's to run it up flagpoles to the lawyers.  It's flagpole.  He's the middle guy.  Old days, we wouldn't even be flagpole.  We would be doing it.  There'd be a wooden leg up here as we speak.  And no one would have noticed.  In the end, no one would have noticed.  It is a very funny idea.  It's a great idea.  And it's the spirit of our show.  If you had come to me, there would be a wooden leg in the studio as we speak. 
[01:51:30]  So, Kurt, do you fly a lot?  I'm just kidding.  Is there anything worse than those fucking radio interviews?  Kurt Metzger will be at Caroline's this weekend.  Very funny guy.  And as soon as I saw him, I'm like, oh, fuck.  I saw this guy in the last comic standing.  And he did a very good job, man.  Really good job.  Kurt's a very funny, dark stand-up.  A very fucking dark stand-up.  Yeah.  Very funny, though.  I'm actually filling in for Tracy Morgan because he had, like, Dirty Rock shit to do.  Really?  So I'm glad to do the show because I guess people didn't know.  Or some people didn't know when I just showed up to headline and not the Tracy that they paid to see. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, shit.  I mean, I'm sure they, I don't know.  I guess Caroline's more speed.  If you've got a Tracy Morgan crowd, they might throw stuff at you.  No, it's all white people that have no idea what they're going to say.  And I'm like, you know.  But they don't know what Tracy's like.  Yeah, I love what Tracy does.  But I love watching white people get disappointed when they see it's like, you know, white-ass fucking jokes.  They're just horrifying.  My favorite Tracy Morgan story, I tell it a lot, but what the fuck.  I saw my Caroline's, this was before Dirty Rock.  And half his act that night was trying to show his pubic hair to the ladies in the front row. 
[01:52:30]  Doesn't he take his, I mean, he took his dick all the way out.  He took my pubic hair.  I think since the Dirty Rock and the success in films, I don't think he pulls out his pubic hair as much.  No, not as much.  Yeah, there's a bunch of people around Tracy.  I interview him for, like, the website for Comedy Central.  Yeah.  And there's like five people standing watching the whole thing.  Making sure everything's on the up and up.  But he was the guy that pulled out his pubic hair.  I don't know.  There's all these stupid fucking publicists and shit when you get big, you gotta deal with.  In some cases, and I hate publicists, but in some cases, when they're trying to prevent 
[01:53:00]  one of the NBC stars from showing his asshole to him, like, Tracy probably needs five people.  Because he's fucking, you know, I'm gonna get you pregnant and put this dick on people.  What are you doing?  I'm gonna put my balls on your girl's shoulder.  It's like you're famous, Tracy.  On your chicken fingers.  Yeah.  When you're eating that chicken fingers, I'm gonna put my balls on them.  Watch what happens.  I'm gonna put a pubic hair on your dentist, Leary.  It's local for people that go to Caroline's.  It's a terrific drink, though.  Somebody told me some story about walking on him in Saturday Night Live. 
[01:53:30]  It was Maureen Tarrant told me, like, who was it?  Wait, maybe you shouldn't say it told me this story.  But he had Tom Hanks in a headlock.  Oh, really?  It's just something.  It was because he realized they both had the same sneakers.  And he couldn't, like...  And then he's like, that's my boy.  And they just walked in, and it was Tom Hanks laughing, and Jim Brewer cracking up,  and he just had Tom Hanks, like, well, we got the same sneakers!  He's an Oscar winner!  That makes people put an Oscar winner in a headlock.  Because they had the same sneakers. 
[01:54:00]  And only a headlock was the only way to...  And only a crazy black guy could get away with that.  Like, if I tried to put Tom Hanks in a head...  It wouldn't come off as good-natured.  It would come off as, like, really awkward and unfunny.  But Tracy, they just...  Security would wrestle you to the floor.  Yeah, I know.  Good Pop-Tart.  Kyle from Boston wants to say he's a douche.  It's okay, Kyle.  We all make mistakes.  Oh, boy.  It's fine.  What did he do?  He gave us some wrong info, which is not a good thing.  Oh, the guy's not a murder suspect?  Yeah, the not murder suspect.  Although, he probably is a murder suspect. 
[01:54:30]  Atta boy, Ant.  I'm just saying.  People call in with some dumb shit to you.  I was listening when the guy called in about Charles Manson was a secret agent.  Yeah, yeah, that guy.  Oh, I love that guy.  That was a good time.  And Patrice thought it was plausible, by the way.  That's hilarious.  Did he?  Of course.  Yeah.  They went to Charles Manson.  That's our representative in the Middle East to change hearts and minds.  Yeah.  Manson.  Patrice is a boob.  How far did you get on Last Comic? 
[01:55:00]  I didn't even make the finals.  Yeah, I know.  I went out to L.A.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  I mean, it's just like free publicity, dude.  It was totally worth doing.  But the further you go, I mean, the bigger you get, right?  Or at least more well-known.  You know what?  I get...  Because people show up to shows, and I'm a lot dirtier than...  I mean, I'm not crazy dirty, but I'm dirtier than what you did on TV.  And, you know, I don't really want a whole bunch of network.  My problem with Last Comic Standing, it's a...  The concept is really good, but like every reality show, they're casting.  Yeah, well, dude, it's intrinsically funny.  You were funnier than a bunch of the people that made the finals.  Yeah, but I didn't think I would win that. 
[01:55:30]  But they're casting.  They have to get the female comic.  They have to get the guy doing kind of Dave Cook's act.  They need a heavy set minority.  You've got to do the minority comic.  You've got to do a guy that's probably a gay comic.  Yeah, no, it's awful.  They're filling comedic roles instead of...  It's called Last Comic Standing.  Get all the guys, and whoever's the funniest should truly keep moving on.  But just having a contest, you're just fucked from the start.  It's just intrinsically a shitty...  You know what I mean?  It's a comedy contest anyway, because everybody likes different shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  True.  I always hate them, too, because you really... 
[01:56:00]  Comics are never going to agree with who wins.  Yeah.  It's like you're not going to see Dave Attell winning comedy contests.  He'll do well, but you know what I mean?  Then they're going to give it to the guy who's good-looking.  It's a casting thing, so you know what it is going in.  They've got the smart comic.  Dude, I went to a NACA thing one time, and it was like...  Somebody else's story to jerk off my head.  I don't really even ask.  It's Big J.  It's not Big J, but he went to a NACA thing.  And it was like a television...  It was about Hood.  You remember Hood, right?  Hood was a Middle Eastern guy. 
[01:56:30]  He was Iranian or whatever, but he used to go on stage with fake bombs strapped to him.  After 9-11, it was actually pretty funny.  Yeah, so this guy...  What an ass!  Yeah, dude.  This is before Insomniac, even.  So Attell goes on...  Jay looks over the shoulder of the college, because college books are dumb as shit, and  he looks at what he's writing next to the comics.  David Attell, it says, ho-hum.  And then right under that with Hood, it says, astonishing.  We must get this for next year.  Holy shit.  Really?  People are fucking stupid.  You don't put it up to them to vote for who's the best. 
[01:57:00]  Ho-hum.  Yeah.  Attell?  Ho-hum for Attell.  Maybe he's just saying one of Attell's punchlines.  Ho-hum.  Ho-hum.  Yeah, they're a repulsive knacka.  You know what I mean?  It's like...  That's...  I mean, but that's that shitty college mentality that they like.  Of course.  They like it, a lot of energy, and, you know, they're not going to love Dave.  Now they would, but they wouldn't have then.  Yeah, right.  I'm babbling.  All right, quickly.  We got some Pink Floyd fans in the room.  I like Pink Floyd a lot, but that's legendary.  We have an amazing version of Comfortably Numb that is worth playing today. 
[01:57:30]  It's amazing.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because Pink Floyd's really hard to do.  Totally.  Did you guys ever try to do Pink Floyd when you were doing the band thing?  Just a couple of acoustic songs, you know.  Smart to go acoustic.  Yeah, smart to go acoustic.  Not as complicated.  People don't expect as much.  Full band, and they nail fucking Floyd.  You want to hear it?  Of course I do.  Want to hear it?  Comfortably Numb?  Sure.  We all know that song.  Comfortably Numb, too, so it's popular.  It sounds like you're listening to Pink Floyd.  Cool.  I really can't wait to hear it. 
[01:58:00]  I just can't wait to hear it.  Hello, hello, hello.  Is there anybody in there?  Yeah, Pink Floyd.  Just not if you can hear me.  Is there anyone at home?  Come on now.  When you feel it, I can ease your faith. 
[01:58:30]  That you are your feet today.  Electricity.  Oh, God.  This is awful.  What is this?  Just the basic facts.  It's a long time.  So.  Are they doing this on purpose? 
[01:59:00]  That's not a music show.  They're just standing on a stage outdoors.  Are they purposely being banned?  Where the fuck are they?  You're only calling me.  It's fucking Doyle and his friends from Sling Blaze.  You no-tunin' son of a bitch.  You can't even hear what your band's playing.  When I was a child, I had a fever. 
[01:59:30]  This is Stink Floyd.  I wanted to say it, but it was much funnier when you said it than it would have been.  Now I've got that feeling once again.  This guy walks around with singer's confidence, too.  Yeah, he certainly does.  He's trancing the stage like a cat.  Like a cunt.  Oh, here comes a big no.  This is what I was waiting for.  Big no.  Oh, happy no. 
[02:00:00]  Happy no.  Holy shit.  What a bum.  Wow.  His hair like John Voight.  Look at the little pumpkins in the front.  John Voight.  It must have been a Halloween show in front of the music store, huh?  Yeah.  A couple shitty pumpkins in front.  I don't see anyone standing there, either.  Just two pumpkins in the audience.  They're not really drawing.  At the end of the video, there is some polite clapping when it's over.  But you could pick out each individual clapper.  So there's got to be seven people clapping. 
[02:00:30]  And it's probably like the friends or their own wife.  Fucking fat chick.  They are horrible.  And what's the title of the video?  It's like butchering.  The worst butchering.  Yeah, it's titled different things in different places.  But the worst cover of probably none ever.  Wow.  Ben Butcher's Pink Floyd.  That is horrid.  Do you know what the name of the band is?  They're fucking...  Do you think they're an actual band? 
[02:01:00]  Is that what you mean?  Wow.  Should give them the McCartney tickets.  It's still better than McCartney.  I do.  Can you stand up?  He's trying to get people to stand up.  And he waves his arm like in a get-up motion.  Yeah, yeah, like stand up.  Now that he's halfway through the song, he's feeling like good about it. 
[02:01:30]  He knows he's nailing it.  Yeah.  He's never sang this one without a fucking cue ball being thrown at him.  Yes, there is.  The fork in my ear.  I smoke me in the water.  This is terrible.  He just made a face like he acknowledged it.  Yeah, the singer's making faces like the bass player's fucking up.  It's like, oh, man, what are you doing?  You're fucking up the song. 
[02:02:00]  Meanwhile, he stinks on ice, this guy.  I was like, someone has been in advance in there a lot of time.  I love the clunker note.  There's a little kid in the corner.  There's actually people there.  The guitarist always looks at the bass player.  The bass player looks at the guitarist and they're both like, you fucked up.  It wasn't me.  A lot of people are onto this thing.  Kevin in Boston, what do you got?  Hey, you got to listen to the guitar solo, man.  It's the best part of the whole thing.  And we were talking over it?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I did.  Somebody sent me this yesterday. 
[02:02:30]  And I was watching it.  I watched the beginning.  These guys are famous now for sucking.  Yeah, they're not good.  Which is great.  This video's everywhere, Ant.  This is a big one.  Your band, you'd love to get the exposure this band's getting.  But not for this reason.  Because you stink.  The other best part is they stink so bad.  They're all singing along with the song, like mouthing the words.  Oh, God.  The drummer's just off in his own universe.  All right, Kevin, thank you.  But wouldn't you...  We got the solo.  Now that it's popular, though, this video, wouldn't you want to go see them? 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  Like, so if they play out somewhere, it's like, wait, that awful Pink Floyd band is playing?  I'm so seeing them.  Get Joe on it.  Yeah.  Get these guys a warm-up before a 2U show.  Yeah, they should be called P-U.  P-U and 2U.  All right, Kevin, we're going to listen to this solo without talking.  Oh, my God. 
[02:03:30]  He just looked to...  Did you see that look?  He looked to his guitar guy and said, do I come in now?  He's like, right here. 
[02:04:00]  And listen, when he comes in.  Go back to the part where he comes in.  It sounds like that black guy that's crying during that show.  I still love you.  He comes in sounding just like that guy.  We can mash that shit right in there.  Yeah, do a mash job.  We can easily do that.  Watch the movie.  He's trying to figure out where he comes in.  Right here?  Right here?  I love the corner of my eye. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, my God.  I love that guy just sings.  Yeah.  I love his fucking stage presence.  The drummer keeps time like a busted fan belt. 
[02:05:00]  It's fucking awful.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Those guys are...  Oh, you see his face?  He knows he sucks.  He gave a face like, ah, my throat today.  He just made me in today.  That's the face like, ah, sorry, guys. 
[02:05:30]  I'm a little cold.  Sorry, I'm not feeling it this life.  Fighting off a cold, yeah.  Fighting off a cold.  Wow, that is some really bad Pink Floyd.  Isn't that great?  What's the name of the band?  I don't know.  I'm going to have to find out.  Yeah, we got to find out.  I need to...  This is right up there with that...  Remember that other video that was out a few months ago?  I know exactly what you're talking about.  Okay.  Yeah, I think I do, anyway.  It's more of a visual, but the guys that were just playing it completely over the top.  The drummer.  Oh. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, no, I thought you were talking about something else.  I thought you were talking about the Final Countdown band.  No, I don't think I've seen that.  Final Countdown?  Yeah, it's like...  Like, as far as terrible covers go, like that Pink Floyd thing, that was like the sequel.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is this the song, the Final Countdown?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The Final Countdown?  What?  It sounds like a Casio.  And there's nobody there in front of them.  You see a lot of grass in front of the stage.  Oh, this is great.  Listen how bad that keyboard is. 
[02:06:30]  It's like the band from Welcome to the Dollhouse.  This guy almost four and a half minutes.  This is great.  Be proud of the stage, too, this guy.  Oh, just back and forth.  It's like Stephen Wright.  Looks like he's autistic.  We're living together and we're still in that world.  And maybe we'll come back.  Maybe.  We'll be just down.  He's got his hand in his pocket. 
[02:07:00]  I guess there is no one to blame.  Uh-oh.  We're living round, living round.  He's doing his own backup vocals.  They're going to practice this shit somewhere.  That's the bad note.  It's so sickly bad.  This is another country or something.  This is so good.  No echo, so he's got to do his own echo. 
[02:07:30]  Is he Asian or Mexican or something?  Yeah, this is like some kind of Eastern Bloc.  And we should be proud to be proud.  Like how he does his own backups.  What is it?  It's the final countdown.  Thank you.  It's the final countdown.  Final countdown. 
[02:08:00]  That's awesome.  That's awesome.  This guy just walks in front of the camera.  Not even a glance at the band.  There's no one there.  This is the saddest thing.  Oh, God.  Go to the end so we can see how they finish it and if there's any ovation.  They're German, dude. 
[02:08:30]  That is so good.  Look at the two guitars right next to each other.  Yeah, they're keeping time perfectly.  It just ends, huh?  Wow.  People try and turn us on to Creed Shreds.  We did that one already.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you haven't checked that out on YouTube.  It's brilliant.  Some guy overdubbed, you know, concert footage with just horrible guitar playing and stuff.  Really, the visual is fantastic.  It's more a visual thing.  It really, yeah.  For Kurt, just like 30 seconds. 
[02:09:00]  Watch.  The vocals, everything.  They just fuck it up completely.  They're the coolest Christians, those guys.  I love that.  Are they Christians?  Yeah, dude.  He was like a Christian rock band.  They're loving me. 
[02:09:30]  They're loving me.  They love you.  They take the actual video and trash it. 
[02:10:00]  I can't breathe in the last part. 
[02:10:30]  Who's the one in doing this?  Brilliant, dude.  Who made that?  That's awesome.  It's brilliant.  I did.  Jerry, you did great with that.  Dude, dude, dude. 
[02:11:00]  Dude, dude.  I can't muck in a little song.  I'm gonna scream like a little girl.  I can't believe it.  I can put subtitles in this one.  Whoever did this must have been dying laughing. 
[02:11:30]  This is a big, pink graphic that says fax in the video.  Oh, they kill them.  They sync it up perfectly.  That doesn't sound good, though, man.  Holy shit. 
[02:12:00]  I mean, Jim, wait a minute.  They had a bunch of good, like, was that a Hitler movie, Last Days, where people were  changing their thoughts?  Sure, yeah.  That's beautiful.  Goddamn.  There's a whole bunch of those Shreds videos.  Like, if you just put Shreds into YouTube, like, the first three are some Shred videos.  You've got Kid Shreds, Kings of Leon Shreds, and Santana Shreds.  But Creed is the best.  Creed, I think that we did another one.  We did their, what was the hit song we did, which was really funny.  With which one?  Last time we did this, it was a different Creed video. 
[02:12:30]  I mean, that one works.  That one's hysterical.  That one's hilarious as well.  Fuck, that is so funny.  I think there's also, like, an Ozzy and Randy Rose one.  God.  It's just funny.  You know how good Randy is, just to hear his little, like, this guy who makes these videos  just doodling on his guitar.  It's just so bad.  Completely fucking it up.  You know what the good part about it is, and you realize how they pull that off, is  they take the video, and when they focus on the guitar player, normally you hear the  entire band, but they just highlight the bad guitar playing, and when they show the singer, 
[02:13:00]  it's just, and the drummer can just be going, and the guy, he does pay attention to detail,  because he tries to, like, if you're, you know, high up on the fretboard, he tries to  make high sounds, if you're low on the fretboard, and he tries to look at the hand and actually  make the strumming pattern sort of match a little bit.  Amazingly enough, there's some talent that went into making that piece of shit.  It's like when Mark Wahlberg has to sing terribly in Boogie Nights, like, he can really sing.  Because he's a singer, right?  And when they cut to shots of the drummer, you see him, he's hitting the cymbals and the  snare at just like how he's hitting it in the video, but he's making it so terrible. 
[02:13:30]  It works so good.  Like, rimming it and fucking it up.  It's great.  Yeah, he does sound like Macho Man, Randy Savage.  Oh, a couple times when he's going, yeah!  It says he was kind of doing a Scott Stapp and just, like, abandoned it.  Yeah, he kind of gets it.  I hope this is the Ozzy one.  I'm not sure.  I mean, we don't have to play it, obviously, but there's a part where I've seen one of  these friends' videos where Ozzy just, like, starts clapping, and there's just nothing  going on except shitty guitar playing and clapping, and it's fucking terribly funny. 
[02:14:00]  It's Jakey Lee.  It's Jakey Lee.  Jake E. Lee shreds for the 
[02:14:30]  people at home. Oh, that is fucking funny.  I'm just clapping his ass off.  Horrible.  Just the guitar and clapping is brilliant.  Horrible.  Oh, man. 
[02:15:00]  You see how he's hammering on it?  Oh, yeah. He's scratching it  perfectly. It's like he's doing it.  Oh, my God. Are people, like, watching  this at home? Is this fun for people  to listen to it?  Give a shit. It's so fucking funny to me.  We're all crying. Who cares what they're doing?  I'm trying to figure out where to clap.  There you go.  I'm clapping.  That's better than the key one.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:15:30]  Holy shit.  That was funny.  That was a great one.  Ozzy clapping.  Ozzy clapping.  Someone asked if you've seen the Rolling  Stones one.  There's a million of them.  Yeah, yeah.  We could sit here all day and do this.  They're brilliant.  I was talking about the band that went  over the top of that Van Halen song  that was viral for a while.  Oh, the Van Halen one.  Yeah, yeah.  With the drummer that just completely  fucking is overplaying it.  That Ozzy clapping is...  I love the fact that the guy is clapping. 
[02:16:00]  I think this might have been the first one  I've seen it.  I think I laughed just as hard this time  as the first one.  That one's really funny.  You have to do this  and laugh your balls off.  We should have a shreds contest.  People should make their own shreds videos.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  We should just steal this guy's idea.  Totally.  That's what I just said.  We should just do this  and pretend like we did it.  Who came up with that, man?  You know, it's brilliant. 
[02:16:30]  It really is.  Hey, if we're talking about music,  can we listen to Brent Michaels  doing the National Anthem?  There was a major bust in there.  Oh, was it?  They're putting it right up there  with all the other bad renditions.  Wow, really?  Did he do a bad job?  Oh, yeah, he did.  What happened to him?  He had brain cancer or something?  Brain cancer or something.  He had something wrong with it.  Yeah, like an aneurysm or some shit  or some kind of fucking  blood vessel brain problem.  We liked Brent Michaels,  but he had a major fail with this.  You know something before you play it? 
[02:17:00]  This is from NASCAR.  That's right.  It's fucking...  It's like impossible...  It's very hard to sing.  And Brent Michaels isn't  a Star Spangled Banner singer.  Yeah.  He's a fucking...  Have a lot of music behind you.  Right, right.  Have a lot of effect on your voice.  Get your...  You know, so you could sing falsetto  and sound like you're singing high.  So, for him to do this,  I don't think I'd have taken the gig.  Yeah.  You know?  Maybe turn down...  He's a vocalist, let's call it. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, let's hear him.  Performed today by this year's  Celebrity Apprentice winner,  Poison Frontman,  Oh, I didn't know that.  Legend, and most importantly,  NASCAR mega-fan,  Brent Michaels,  and Miami's own  Nanette Molina.  What?  Oh, say,  can you see...  Oh, he starts real well.  By the dawn's early light.  Uh-oh.  What so proudly we hailed 
[02:18:00]  At the twilight's last gleaming  Whose broad stripes and bright stars  Wow, he's really off  Through the peril  He's probably got the echo  coming back at him too, right?  He's got monitors.  Through the ramparts we watched  Were so gallantly streaming  Oh, here we go.  Who the fuck is that? 
[02:18:30]  Susan Boyle.  Someone stepped on a clit.  He couldn't do the high notes  so they got another singer.  Just let her do it.  Yeah.  Wow.  She didn't nail it.  How many celebrities  have sucked at this?  That's always a thing.  Somebody bombing it  doing a national anthem.  Oh, that's cool as fuck.  F-16.  These jets will see. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  I mean, it's not good,  but it's not like crazy embarrassing.  Is it good, bad?  No, he's just off.  It's not good.  It's bad.  It's not good,  but it's not like legendary.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  It's truly terrible.  Yeah.  We should open it.  But there are some real  that were way worse than that.  If she was going to start,  if she was going to take over  the high parts,  why did he start so low?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  Yeah, because it didn't fit.  Or maybe,  because I guess maybe  he was backing off 
[02:19:30]  for her range.  I don't know.  That's kind of strange.  Here's my analysis.  It just stunk.  It really did stink.  Do you remember  when they used to advertise  where you could get an album  of the Star Spangled Banner  and all these patriotic songs?  K-Tel?  Yeah, it was like,  who would...  I mean, not another guess,  but what insane person  would get it and listen...  There were some really weird collections  that used to come out years ago  that K-Tel would do.  Yeah, K-Tel, dude.  It was Pomp and Circumstances on it.  Yeah, yeah.  If you always wanted that.  Yeah, if you need that,  like the presidential fucking... 
[02:20:00]  Sounds like the Congress  is walking in.  But how much pomp  do you need in your life?  A lot of pomp,  a lot of Circumstances.  Maybe a little bit, but...  And then remember  that other commercial  where it's like,  these classic songs,  The Polovitzian Dance No. 3  by Borodin.  You might know this as...  And he'd give you  like what you know it as.  You know,  you might know  this is the Benny Hill theme.  It is actually  Rekharkov Swar  by fucking...  He'd give you 
[02:20:30]  the classical version.  The Benny Hill theme  is really...  Has a real name?  Oh, of course it does.  It does.  It's not the Benny Hill theme.  Oh, I know that.  It's called Yakety Sax.  Yakety Sax.  Oh, of course.  Beethoven's Yakety Sax.  Yakety Sax.  What else would you call that?  Flagpole.  Flagpole.  Flagpole.  Flagpole answer?  I don't know.  We're all...  I have an answer on the first one.  He looks very, very...  Here, wait a second.  Let me put this up.  Before he walks in,  how much weight  did he fucking gain, dude? 
[02:21:00]  Look at him.  I know.  I don't know what's going on.  Come on.  What the fuck?  Hi, Eric!  What's wrong with him?  What are you saying?  Nothing.  I wasn't saying how excited  he's coming in.  Oh.  Why are you gaining so much weight?  I'm fat.  I think I'm fat.  Is it time for an Iraq weigh-in?  We can do that.  You have to be...  I did one before I left.  Yeah, but you have to be,  I think, bigger than you were.  Kurt, I think we're bothered by him.  No, I'm still at the same weight.  We're bothered by him  because he obviously  shouldn't be a fat guy.  No!  You know what?  Some guys carry their fatness fine. 
[02:21:30]  I used to be fatter,  like, in my old headshots,  they're on there.  I look like a fucking meathead  from my...  My manager still sends it around.  But what you do do,  get some of those  dangerous fat burners.  That'll take that shit right off.  Some of that dangerous shit?  Yeah.  Some fucking amphetamines?  Don't take this on the side.  I'm getting close to caring again.  Damn, Kurt.  I'm almost there.  There you go.  There's a nice Iraq fatness  on my old...  Colin had the best...  And I'm stealing this from Colin.  He had the best line about Kurt.  What did he say?  I have Serbian rape faces. 
[02:22:00]  That really is...  Wow.  That's you?  Yeah, dude.  That looks nothing like you.  Get the fuck out of here.  How much are you loose?  Not even that much, dude.  I just started exercising a little bit.  That face is fucking great.  Yeah, look at the goatee one.  Wow.  Where's the goatee?  There?  Oh, wow.  That's a goatee.  Make it look like you have a chin.  Yeah.  There?  No, this one right there.  That's not one...  Yeah, that one's not that bad.  Damn.  Yeah, there's dating a Sicilian chick  and, like,  she's like a fairy 
[02:22:30]  that everything she touched  turned to fat.  Like, my dog's fat.  I got fucking...  Kevin from Connecticut,  E-Rock weighs 15 Aussie gifts.  Oh, shit.  Oh, damn.  I think that would be 270 pounds.  Would E-Rock use...  Oh, not that much.  E-Rock fluctuates in weight  more than anybody else on staff,  I think.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I need to lose about,  I think, 40.  40?  40. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, you kind of go between  obese and morbidly obese.  Well, you're getting pretty close there, Jim.  I know.  That just took the wind out of my sails.  Not to be just a picky prick always,  but why that part of it?  Like, why is there that rule?  That goes with our theme  where everything is so complicated.  Why would that...  Why?  Do you know, E-Rock?  I know just a little bit more  it's a legal issue  and it's not negotiable.  But what is the legal issue? 
[02:23:30]  No, I want to know.  I want to know.  That's all I was told.  I want to know.  I'm going to read this.  For knowledge.  Yeah, because we're not trying  to bitch about the company,  but we just don't understand sometimes.  Can it only be mentioned once?  Yeah.  Because about a wooden leg?  Is that why?  No, not that one.  I'm still waiting for that one to come in.  We got a Twitter idea  for the Paul McCartney tickets.  It has been approved.  But, and this is what's so weird,  it can only be mentioned once.  So you can't even tell me right now  what it is?  No. 
[02:24:00]  It's like using a wish.  You can't use your wish  and then fuck up and went,  well, I wished for some shit.  I fucked it up.  And they're serious about it.  It can only be mentioned once.  Could you, I'm not trying to be a dick today.  I really, I'm not.  I want knowledge.  Could you ask him why?  Are you leaking like state secrets?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a WikiLeaks dump.  WikiLeaks.  Kurt, our theme with this show  is that radio's gotten ridiculously complicated  and it doesn't have to be.  And it even says  we cannot solicit it again  after the initial announcement.  It's okay to talk about it again 
[02:24:30]  once a winner's declared.  A winner's declared.  But why?  It can only be mentioned once.  Why only once?  Legally, I would love to know why.  I don't get one out.  Great, Daffy.  That was wonderful.  Yeah, but I can only do it once.  Because if you mention it more than once  and I'm going to guess.  Because if it's a passing mention,  then it's a spontaneous thing  as opposed to a planned contest.  And once it becomes a planned contest,  I'm just going to guess.  There has to be official rules.  This is Jim Norton guessing.  Jim Norton Esquire.  I bet you you're right, dude. 
[02:25:00]  They do that on like...  Jimmy doing well in Radio 101.  Wow.  Yes.  Which is once again why lawyers  really should all be fucking dumped into it.  If you could fill...  If you could put like AIDS in a giant jug  and put lawyers in and say,  drink your way out of it.  They're fucking...  And this is all...  Not just this...  All corporate attorneys...  I'm going with Jimmy.  Are shitheads.  I don't need the answer.  I think Jimmy nailed it.  You think that's it?  But the sad part is  the lawyers created the rules thing.  Of course they did.  We went decades doing radio contests  without having official rules. 
[02:25:30]  But for some reason  you now have to have official rules  for certain contests.  So there has to be official rules?  Dude, every contest  has to have official rules  and it has to be on your website.  So people can check out  the rules for themselves.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ, dude.  Or they could call  and get official rules  for that contest  mailed to them.  Can't we just figure...  Why?  Probably because a couple of lawsuits  a couple of scumbag people  got scumbag lawyers  and sued scumbag companies.  No.  You know what I mean?  And other scumbag lawyers 
[02:26:00]  got involved.  I'm sure it started  with terrestrial radio.  This shit didn't start satellite.  It probably started  with terrestrial.  And they're just fucking  picking up the ball  where terrestrial is.  Every kind of entertainment  you've got to have  some kind of professional cowards  to like stand away  if it's a publicist  or a lawyer.  Yeah, there's too much fun  and entertainment  going on here.  Let me step in.  All lawyer business cards  should have just pictures  of shit piled up  like a giant steaming pile  of shit with their name  next to it.  No job title.  We know what you do.  Sure. 
[02:26:30]  You know?  Oh yeah, you're a lawyer.  I see.  Why don't we...  I got an idea  because Iraq's got  a pretty good Twitter account.  It's called OA Photos.  I like it  because it's all  the old school photos  where we show you  all the stuff we used to do  so we all could go  down memory lane.  Why don't we use  his Twitter account?  We could do that.  Give me one second.  I might have an answer.  You have to get it approved?  Is this the ass fucking contest?  It goes Iraq.  It's not even...  Okay, here we are.  There we go.  There's always discussions.  I don't...  It has nothing to do with Iraq.  There's now discussions going on. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  There's a buzz in the hall.  Oh, wow.  Hi, Troy.  Hello, Roy.  The reason is  if you mention it once...  It's not snowing in here.  You really are wearing  a little fucking...  You're like Brad...  Johnny Depp doing poems, hey?  Are you trying to pick up women  at the workplace, sir?  Always.  Always in pick up women mode.  Is there anything  to look at around here?  Exactly.  You dress for the night  before Christmas.  Don't name particular people 
[02:27:30]  because then you could be  in trouble with HR.  Yeah.  That's true.  But in general,  are there a couple?  Eh.  Eh.  If you squint.  I've seen another book.  If you just squint.  That's good.  It's like the hat Brad Pitt wears  when he brings home  a new black kid.  Kirk Metzger  and Caroline's  all the way.  Damn.  That is totally it, too.  See the shitty beard  to go in?  I got a video  wearing pretty much  that same hat  from the old days  and from Real Rock TV 
[02:28:00]  so I should shut the fuck up.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Gregorio.  You got an answer?  Yes.  So if you announce it once,  that gives everybody  that's listening at that time  an opportunity  to do whatever  you need them to do.  If you say it again later,  people may just be tuning in  and they would be  at a disadvantage.  So who cares?  Who fucking cares?  Who came up with that?  How about  too fucking bad?  But who came up with that?  Lawyers.  I mean,  I don't think lawyers.  I think another guy  trying to be  doing a little too much 
[02:28:30]  with his job title.  Is this like,  because when I worked  Don Gong Show,  they had a guy  from like a government guy  making sure the rules  that were made up  were followed  because of a quiz show?  Is that like what that is?  It's all that stuff.  Contest.  Unfair advantage.  How about it?  We never have that guy  at last time standing,  by the way.  Is this part of the  everyone wins a trophy  world we live in?  Yeah.  Do you know what great,  by the way,  my goddaughter  got a report card.  Like,  I don't even know  what the hell  they put on it now,  dude.  It's like O's.  Yeah,  there's no A, 
[02:29:00]  B, C, D,  and it's like for shit  like,  I think it's a New York  thing,  though.  It's like participates  in class,  looks engaged.  There's all this shit  like self-esteem shit.  Psychobabble.  It's crazy, dude.  How old is she?  She's fucking eight.  Oh, who does she look  she's engaged to?  Engaged.  No, it's written like that.  Like some,  you know.  But see,  you take the grades  out of the equation,  then there's no pressure  to learn in school anymore.  I mean,  not that I felt that pressure  when they were using  grades,  but who gave a shit? 
[02:29:30]  A lot of people did then.  Who gives a shit?  And it turned out  I was totally right  not to give a shit.  Yeah, right.  Right.  Exactly.  Nine out of ten times,  you're absolutely right.  Do you know how we could  probably get around that rule?  If you said something like  at 9.30,  let's say,  you know,  I'm not saying this,  this isn't the contest,  so don't fucking run off.  Because we could be  in trouble for doing that.  I'm just talking.  But if you gave a time  and said that  at that certain time  you have to do this,  you could probably announce it  up until that time. 
[02:30:00]  No,  because people just tuning in  would have less time  to get to the...  I wish I knew  what this contest was.  I don't know.  Would that be?  I need to know...  I don't think it...  Is it a foot race?  Is that why you need to...  Yeah, what the fuck?  People start running around.  That's the whole object of it.  It's kind of a race to get there.  Could Troy find out  who came up with that?  I'm going to bet  it wasn't a lawyer.  No?  Yeah.  You think it's somebody  practicing law?  It's a real concern.  Guaranteed it's a lawyer.  You think it's somebody  practicing a little...  Guaranteed. 
[02:30:30]  Guaranteed.  Down the hallway law?  That fucking...  Lawyers don't care about fairness.  But they care about the...  That's why I'm saying  it's not a lawyer.  They care about  the penalties  of not practicing fairness.  They don't care about anything  other than fucking  out-legaling each other.  They're shitheads.  The penalties are what pays,  not the...  They don't care about integrity.  The fairness.  They don't give a fuck  about fairness.  If you said, look,  the first one to fuck a baby  wins a hat,  they'd be all for that  unless they could get sued.  They care about dignity.  Do you think they care 
[02:31:00]  about dignity?  God, lawyers, fuck off.  And publicists, dude,  had that part.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I used to write for  the Video Game Awards  every year on Spike.  Yeah.  And, dude, writing the shit,  the patter for the  fucking celebrities to say.  Oh, right, right.  And going to their publicists.  And they all want to be funny,  but none of them  want to fucking be funny.  Don't want to...  No, he won't say that.  Dude, the guy from...  Who was his name?  Chris Klein,  the dude from American Pie. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  He was like a nightmare  writing shit.  Really?  For this dude.  And his publicist said no to...  And the last one we had  was like...  It wasn't that good of a bit,  but it would have worked.  It was like some fake charity  and we were just going to  put shit up behind him  and all he had to do  was deliver the lines.  And it was like...  So he made up a handicap  called like 8-Bit Face  or something stupid, right?  And it was like,  oh, look, the kid has no eyes  because he's 8-Bit, right?  His publicist goes,  yeah, he doesn't want to make  fun of kids with no eyes.  I'm like, listen,  this isn't a real condition.  It's 8-Bit.  Do you not understand?  No, and then she goes,  we're afraid nobody's going to get that. 
[02:32:00]  Like, only gamers are going to get that.  I mean, it's the fucking  video game awards,  you stupid twat.  The only place where people  would get that is here.  She's fucking shit,  but you know who else is shit?  The fucking pussy boy actor  and these fucking  faggy celebrities.  And the kids have no fucking eyes.  Exactly.  Fucking throw your glasses at,  you little queer.  You got no eyes.  Fucking...  Oh, uh, yes.  So the lawyers came up with this.  Of course they did.  Of course they did.  And what if, uh,  what if there was a set time?  Well, they said that 
[02:32:30]  we could get sued  if we announce it  and then it was announced again later  and then the people  that had the disadvantage  of hearing it later  could sue  because it wasn't fair.  Yeah, Paul McCartney did it?  Because contest rules have to be...  How about this?  How about the fact that  they weren't fucking listening?  So tough shit.  That's what motivates you to listen.  What are you going to sue for, by the way?  How about can they sue for this  if you say the 10th caller? 
[02:33:00]  I was farther away from a phone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How come they can't sue for that?  That would be the same type of thing.  I have no fingers.  Exactly.  I can't punch the keys.  They're saying that it's not fair  to the people who aren't listening.  Right.  Right.  It's not fair to the people  that aren't listening.  When you try to take care of the people  that are listening.  Thanks.  That's amazing.  Great.  It's not fair to the people  who aren't listening.  You're right.  Yes.  And if they hear it again,  tough shit.  Do we have to give them away today  or can we give them away next week?  Gary's trying to get us to stay.  Yeah, but as far as I'm...  I wonder if we were supposed to 
[02:33:30]  give these away by today  at the end of show.  He'll find Gary or let us go.  I bet we could.  The 10th caller.  No, we're not doing a 10th caller.  The 10th caller will be the 10th caller.  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Yeah, I might have went too far with that.  Oh my God.  That's it.  The 10th caller is just that.  But what if I wasn't listening  when you said that?  True.  I know.  There's a problem.  That's not fair.  Maybe we should just knock  on everyone's door  and tell them we'll be doing this  to turn their radio on.  Can we just give everybody...  Can we just give all the fans 
[02:34:00]  a pair of tickets?  Can we do that?  Is there enough for everyone?  Because that way it's fair for everyone.  Everyone gets a trophy.  Everyone gets tickets.  It is lawyers being scumbags,  but it's also...  It's the public  because the public  has sued for stuff like this.  These fucking shitty  fellow citizens of ours  have sued  because they didn't think  it was fair.  Is Troy going to the big show?  I know you're a Beatles fan.  Huge, huge McCartney fan.  No, and I just want to say  that I would pretty much...  McCartney over Lennon?  Yeah, dude.  Huge McCartney fan over Lennon.  What?  Yeah.  McCartney had the best songs. 
[02:34:30]  I think.  Well, he did that  at Michael Jackson  where they fight over a chick.  Oh, that's great.  Say, say, say  what you want.  The 80s and 90s  weren't good for McCartney.  The girl's mine.  Oh, God.  You know the girl's mine.  The girl's mine.  I like girls.  The girl's mine.  Michael was convincing, right?  The doggone girl is mine.  Hey, Michael,  stay with this girl.  The doggone girl is mine.  The doggone girl is mine.  Michael was so convincing.  Not this one. 
[02:35:00]  No.  That was actually a good song.  The girl is mine.  This is good.  The propofol is mine.  We might need the video  where they talk  before the song kicks in.  Troy, why aren't you going?  Didn't everyone here get tickets?  No.  I tried to get tickets,  but I couldn't get them.  I heard there was  some kind of lottery or something.  Yeah.  Did they tell everyone  at the same time?  Yeah, right?  But I just want to put it out there.  You should sue.  I almost do anything  for those tickets.  Oh.  Suck my car.  Yeah, but I don't even know  if we're allowed  to just give you tickets  for humiliating yourself. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, I don't know either.  That would be against the rules.  Yeah.  And Kurt, this is,  like I said,  we're just,  we don't understand.  I know, the video  where they're like a traveling...  It's gotten so complicated  to do this.  Oh.  And then,  now what happens  is the show will end  and now  I'll get yelled at.  Doggone girl is...  For beating up the comedy.  Yeah, the doggone girl  is mine.  This is terrible.  This whole shite.  Ugh.  The doggone skin light  and thin nose are mine.  You fucking creep. 
[02:36:00]  So happy.  The doggone satin pillow's mine.  Fucking weirdo.  The doggone white kids  are not mine.  The elephant bones are mine.  Mine.  Yeah, the 80s and 90s  weren't good to McCartney,  but he's put out  some really good work recently.  Your catalog of music is mine.  Troy?  Yes.  If my wife can't go  to the Paul McCartney show  at the Apollo Theater,  I would love for you 
[02:36:30]  to be my guest.  Wait, wait, wait.  Do we get a pair of tickets?  Yeah.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  So if she can't make it,  I would love to bring you.  Awesome.  Thanks.  I appreciate it.  I honestly thought  that I only got one ticket.  We already have a babysitter.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's a nice suggestion.  I was just thinking of it.  I'm going to bring somebody,  but it's my own contest.  The chick with the biggest clit.  Yeah, we can have  our own contest for the tickets.  That's not fair  for small clitted women 
[02:37:00]  or women from Defer.  From the sedan.  Dude, I was with this  Gar-Fur.  Her small little spade shovel  was used to just shove  their clit out.  You like them big, right?  That's your thing.  A little gardening tool.  Oh, yeah.  A garden weasel  to her clit out.  I was with this  Puerto Rican girl  one time,  and it was a big clit,  but it looked like  a miniature dickhead  on the end of it.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want that.  Jimmy loves that.  I do.  Jimmy, the girl is mine.  Is Jackie here?  Yes.  I've been here.  Oh, shit.  I didn't see him  on the line of sight. 
[02:37:30]  Where is he,  down the hall?  If I don't see him,  I don't know he's here.  Jackie's here.  There's the house.  Sorry, Jackie.  He's been here.  Well, get him up here then.  Hey, hey, hey.  You doing it right now?  What?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Oh.  I didn't know.  Where were we with this, Troy?  Yeah, man.  I mean, I'll do anything  for tickets, so whatever.  If the opportunity comes up.  I honestly thought  I was only getting one ticket,  and I didn't even argue  the point or question it.  You just assumed, right?  Because I assumed  they just would throw me  one bone.  How do you absolutely 
[02:38:00]  know it's a pair?  I don't.  When I read that email,  it said nothing  about two tickets.  Oh, wait.  I think...  Flag, Paul.  See if we get two tickets.  No, my email said two.  It said plus one.  Did it say two tickets?  One for Opie  and one for Anthony?  Yeah.  I want to see if one...  He actually acknowledged  my wife to make me  a little more personal.  I don't believe I'm getting  two tickets.  He kind of knows me, you know.  Oh, they're talking to you.  I bet I don't get two tickets.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I bet because I'm not married  or something.  There's a rule.  The lawyer said  only married employees 
[02:38:30]  get two tickets.  No, you probably  don't get two tickets  because you're a jerk.  No, you got a pair.  We all got a pair.  Hey, do we have to do  this contest or not?  Because we only have  a half hour to do it.  I have not heard.  Should we just do this one  just in case?  Yeah, let's rock this one out.  Right?  Make it count.  Mention it once  and then for the love of Jesus,  don't say it again.  It's very complicated today.  Jackie, the joke man  modeling making his way  into the studio  as we speak.  That's Kurt Metzger  to your left.  If you don't know Kurt, 
[02:39:00]  he's playing Carolines  this weekend.  He's tall and handsome  and young.  Fuck him.  Handsome, thanks.  Hello, Mr. Norton.  Hello, guys.  Hi, buddy.  Hi.  So let's get the word out there.  We're trying to get  a contest thing going,  but it's trying to run  a contest by these  fucking managers.  Well, I have my ideas.  I heard some of your show,  so I have my ideas  for your McCartney ticket.  Oh, okay.  I think you should give  two tickets to the prettiest girl  who gives the best blowjob.  Yeah, Jimmy brought that up already,  but I don't think management  said management wants  the blowjobs. 
[02:39:30]  And then she has to try  to collect them  with a broken jaw.  I just threw that in  for my own pleasure.  Would you like to hear  my other suggestions?  Sure.  Yes, Jackie.  Whoever brings  an autographed photo  of Pete Best.  Ah, see?  That would be a good one.  How do we know  it's an actual photograph?  Autographed.  Yeah, how do we know  it's not forged?  Wait, we have another answer  because Pete Best  will probably bring it in.  I'd love to see him.  No, it's me.  He doesn't take my calls. 
[02:40:00]  We now have to go to E-Rock  because he has an answer  to one of the many questions  we have today.  E-Rock?  Oh, E-Rock?  Because I eat too much.  Welcome to the club, Jim.  I know, I know.  Oh, shit!  Oh, did he nail you?  I can't even argue.  I've been eating like a pig  and it's showing.  Oh, Jimmy.  How does that feel?  You hurt me.  All right, one out of,  what, a million.  It doesn't hurt as much  and it doesn't hurt me.  It never hurts as much  as the food tastes good.  I know.  Low literal E-Rock.  I'm just joking.  You got me, 
[02:40:30]  you should get me.  By the way,  speaking of awful bodies,  DeRosa last night.  Oh, DeRosa's body  is horrendous.  It's terrible.  Oh, dude,  that partridge body of his.  He's on stage.  Dude, he's on stage  doing a joke about,  he goes,  I'm not eating what I want,  you know,  because my metabolism,  here's the whole thing  about his metabolism's good.  It looks like he stuffed pillows  into his fucking sweater  before he went on.  Joe.  Here's the metabolism  of a fucking,  of a brick.  And he will not do  his sit-up, dude.  He'll decorate  Billy's apartment  and like cook real,  you know,  he'll do all that  swing bachelor shit, 
[02:41:00]  but he ain't doing  his sit-up.  You're missing the obvious,  he doesn't have shoulders.  Get the guy  to work his fucking  Kermit arms  to lift some.  Hey,  go ahead,  E-Rock.  E-Rock,  the answer to  one of the questions.  Okay,  so you don't have to  give the tickets away today,  but they need to have  an answer today  is what you want to do  next week  when you give it away  and it has to be approved.  It's exhausting.  I love this.  I think it's going to be  10th and 20th caller,  man.  Do I love this stuff?  Why don't we just make 
[02:41:30]  an obnoxious number?  Caller number 750.  Why don't you give the tickets  to anybody whose name is Ringo?  Yes,  with a legitimate Ringo.  It's got to be on the license.  I wonder if one exists.  See,  Jackie's thinking.  You only did like  one leg people  and shit like that?  Yeah,  we tried to get somebody  that brings in a wooden leg  that didn't even make it  down the hallway.  Jackie,  how great is that idea?  First person with a wooden leg.  That's the only idea.  That's old school,  right?  They don't understand that shit.  It's perfect kind.  Perfect for our show.  You know,  like they can't go to the bathroom 
[02:42:00]  with their leg  or some real McCartney shit.  Yeah.  Yeah,  something.  You could really get rank.  No shame.  Yeah.  So that idea was rejected  before it even got out of your mouth,  I'm sure,  right?  Yeah,  yeah,  they heard it.  Some people have no sense  You left Howard's show  at a perfect time,  my friend.  No,  I left at the worst time  because it was two months before.  I'm a big Beatle fan.  I really wanted to meet  fucking McCartney  and he came on  like a month after I left.  That's best for me.  He heard you were gone.  Yeah.  That fuck's gone. 
[02:42:30]  He's gone.  Wow,  so now we got to  come up with it  and have it approved  before we leave today.  See,  that sounds like  something I don't want to do  on a Friday.  Brainstorming the...  Yeah,  I fucking...  Now they're playing  into our weakness.  I know.  See what they're doing?  They're playing  into our weakness.  They know.  They know why I suggest...  I leave cartoon character  smoke behind me  when I leave  on a Friday.  You actually hear...  Gone.  I have the world's  worst possible suggestion,  but since we're sitting here 
[02:43:00]  and you've been...  Let it fly,  please.  You keep saying  what's another idea  to run up the flagpole?  Why don't you give the tickets  to somebody  that actually shows up  at the fucking building  with a flagpole?  Run up the flagpole.  Somebody that goes to trouble  and come to New York City  with a flagpole.  It's kind of funny, right?  It really is.  Like a full-size flagpole?  Yeah,  it's got to be  at least 20 feet.  It's got to be  at least 20 feet.  It'll call attention  to Sirius  and to the show, right?  It's got to be  a giant flagpole.  Now we can't do that  because it got mentioned once. 
[02:43:30]  Why don't you mention it  once on the air?  You can't say it twice.  They really got to cut  somebody's pulls off.  I know.  It's like Jackie's Joke  on all the time.  Hey, oh, that's a great joke.  You get a Jackie's  talking joke machine.  No, you can't do that.  You can't do that.  You know?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Because it's not fair  to the orphans in Alaska.  Blow me.  Fuck them.  Jesus Christ.  You can't just give out  shit anymore like that?  You know,  it can't be a contest.  You can only bequeath it.  You know,  it's been four years.  I still have no fucking...  I just say it.  I say, look,  you get something.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Give me your address  and go to the mailbox  and we'll see what happens.  Something might turn up there.  Some jerk has started all that.  But it's some fucking contest pig  who sued in terrestrial radio  and then satellite  is just kind of  picking up on the queue.  You know,  it's some fucking dirtbag  that's sued  and now nobody else  wants to get sued.  I'll tell you,  it sucks because  when they first started  the internet,  this guy approached me  and I had something  to do with his website  and you don't know  the power this thing's  going to have  and he says,  hey,  why don't you let me  give away a modem 
[02:44:30]  on my website  and call it a Jackie Martling giveaway.  Whatever it was,  he promised somebody  a modem  that he was going  to give him  and he reneged.  His site closed down  a week later.  The fucking guy  that he didn't give it to,  I swear to you,  I think he's still  bad-mouthing me.  Jackie didn't give me a modem.  Where's my 8-track player  and my modem?  Honest to God.  14-4 modem.  You know the thing about  if you sign autographs  for 100,000 people  and the one person 
[02:45:00]  you say,  listen,  I'm really tired,  I've got to get to the airport,  my mother's dying of cancer,  that person's going to tell  everybody for the rest of your life  what a cocksucker you are.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  You should get cancer,  you should only get cancer.  Dude, people are fucking horrible  for any free shit.  I went on a warmed up,  and I'm a terrible warm up guy  by the way,  but I warmed up,  I just got fired off marriage,  ref,  like five minutes on.  Really?  Yeah.  You didn't last the whole day?  No, dude,  not at all.  Oh, shit.  They gave me like  the dead man walking  like the whole deal.  How did you know  you were fired?  Because everybody  just got real weird  when I got off.  It wasn't that you used 
[02:45:30]  Jerry and cunt  in the same sentence.  Dude, I really...  That's a deal breaker.  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't think I sunk.  I was visibly nervous,  but I didn't think  I didn't nail it  in like four and a half minutes  or whatever it was.  And you know  when you were up there,  they were still talking.  They were all talking like,  oh, do you think...  Because he's watching it,  you know,  they're like,  it wasn't Jerry,  but it had to be, dude.  He's in control.  He's not even funny.  But they said,  I was like,  listen, I don't do warm ups.  You understand that, right?  And they're like,  yeah, we did.  They want a comic.  It was this guy,  Joey Cola,  who does do that.  He's great at that.  Yeah, he really is.  Well, they thought 
[02:46:00]  he was too warm up-y.  Too warm up-y.  Well, now he's back.  You weren't warm up-y enough.  He was too good at his job.  Yeah.  Did Joey hold him up  for more money?  I hope he did, dude.  That's really like  NBC's official.  Like, take the guy  that's good in his spot  the fuck out of there  and get a guy  no one wants  and blame him.  We don't want the guy  that's good at his job.  We want the guy  like the guy  that's good at his job.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't get the guy.  Get someone that's his type.  Jesus.  The Who Wants to Be a Millionaire  I did one time  filling in  and it's like a circular thing. 
[02:46:30]  It's daytime  that Meredith Vieira won.  These people are such animals  for a fucking t-shirt  that you'd never wear anywhere.  A Who Wants to Be a Millionaire t-shirt  and they scream  and they get pissed, dude.  Like, if I fuck up  who I'm throwing the t-shirt to.  It was for me!  There's old women  cursing me out, dude.  And Meredith Vieira  looked at me funny  and her face crinkled up like...  I had no idea  how wrinkly she was,  by the way,  until she spouted at me.  She just looked at me like,  wow, they can't hide that.  People are like that  the minute you say  to any crowd anywhere  that you have free anything 
[02:47:00]  but especially a free t-shirt  the crowd gets a life of its own  like in a ballgame  or in a cunt.  God damn, you're right.  It's a fucking t-shirt.  How many t-shirts you got?  T-shirts.  The more you throw away  the more you have.  You should just charge  for those McCartney tickets.  That's the best.  Just sell them.  That's the best.  Run out the phone.  Can we sell them?  Yeah.  And then just buy shit  for ourselves.  Fuck them.  We want to trade them  for kiddie porn.  Is that allowed?  Barter.  That's a trade. 
[02:47:30]  Remember Barter?  Your best kiddie porn.  A duffel bag of child porn  that weighs at least eight pounds.  I've got to come with a laptop  with the best scene.  You're going to hear  a hilarious scumbag thing.  Big Jay Oakerson  is a scumbag.  We were doing  those Steve-O shows  at Caroline's.  We were talking about porn.  We were talking about  Coke or something  because Steve-O,  he's sober.  I was like,  the worst thing  I ever did  when I was doing Coke a lot  was I jerked off  to horse porn.  Not like I happened upon it,  like I actively  saw it out. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, and I was like...  Who did you want to be  in the movie?  That's the...  Oh, man.  I don't know.  Excuse me.  Can I have a different seat?  Yeah, so...  But that's the reaction to that.  So Jay goes,  I look at horse porn  all the time.  What are you fucking  talking about?  And then Gino Bisconti  next to me goes,  you really watch that?  And then Jay says this  with that thing.  He goes,  you probably like  overproduced porn though,  dude.  Overproduced,  he called it.  Overproduced?  You know,  two humans.  I'm not a fan  of the overproduced shit.  Nah, I just like  a fucking...  I like a pussy  and some oats. 
[02:48:30]  Was that the first  real disgusting porn  like a million years ago?  I think it was on VHS,  the German girl  blowing the pony?  Yeah, yeah.  Wasn't that the king of war?  And that was the most...  That was the most taboo shit  you were ever going to see  back then.  My God.  Yeah.  I still don't feel right  after seeing that.  Dude, you are...  That's nothing.  No.  That's just nothing.  Jimmy, you did that  David Tell thing, right?  The porno show?  The porno showtime, yes.  But these old porn stars,  dude, did you see what  Saka...  Oh, you were in the Saka one?  I did with Saka, yeah.  Saka looks like  she has a cooking show now, dude. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, she's definitely  a little older.  She's in her 50s.  She came out with...  Me and Dave did the...  We watched her movies  and we comment on them,  kind of like  Mystery Science Theater,  and it's just me  and Attell on a couch  and then she comes out  and talks about it.  It was cool, though.  Oh, cool.  That's fun.  It was fun.  It's an original idea.  To do that with porn  is perfect for me.  Yes.  We have to take  one more break  and then we're going to  go to the end.  And my tickets go on sale.  Can I plug that?  In 27 minutes  for January 15th,  the Saturday show 
[02:49:30]  that's been added  with myself, Bill Burr,  Jim Brewer,  and Dave Attell  at the event center  at the Borgata.com.  That's a monster show.  It's going to sell out.  First one did  in less than a day  or about a day.  About 30 hours, yeah.  And this one's going to  go real fast.  I think so.  And then we got Kurt.  First time Kurt's been  on our show.  Kurt Metzger.  At Caroline's tonight.  Caroline's through  the weekend, right?  Actually, just tonight.  Oh, just tonight.  Just tonight.  I'm just filling in  for Tracy.  Okay.  I'm doing New Year's  at Caroline's  and I'm on the show  Ugly Americans  if you watch that.  I auditioned for that  and didn't get it. 
[02:50:00]  But I'm happy you did.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  And our pal Jack  of the Joke Man.  Yeah, there's way,  way too many tickets  still available  for the Mohican Sun  on Saturday night.  8 p.m.  I'll be there.  Way too many available.  Plenty of room.  Bring a fucking  picnic basket.  What's worse  than asking for counts?  I fucking hate asking.  So what's the count?  Are you talking  to your agent?  What's the count?  It's like,  oh, you never want to get it.  You don't want to get it.  Fuck yeah.  No, that's one of those  things when you call,  oh, I got a machine. 
[02:50:30]  My agent,  I had a fan.  I never listened  to dumb fans.  I was doing this gig  and they're like,  dude, it's sold out.  And I'm like, really?  And Kenny goes,  there's a problem.  The show can't get  put on sale yet  on the website.  Like, I had no tickets sold.  And this asshole fan  got my hopes up.  It's sold out, dude.  Somebody says that  when you know  there's no possible way.  Oh, well, I called up  and the phone was busy.  You know.  The worst time,  the worst thing  that ever happened  to me in my fucking life.  I went away with Rodney  to Las Vegas in 1980. 
[02:51:00]  And you know,  you think at some point  you become,  you know,  you're new in show business  when you first,  you think at some point  you become somebody  and none of that shit  matters again.  And we show up  and we take the limo  from the airport  and we walk into the Aladdin.  The first fucking thing  he did was ran  to the ticket office  and said,  how's sales?  And I'm like,  motherfucker,  it never ends.  It'll never end.  And that was the worst  thing of my life.  You realize if he's doing it,  if he's,  Jesus.  That's it.  Dude,  I just got fucking ripped off  a Mohegan song,  by the way. 
[02:51:30]  What?  Kurt, Kurt,  shut up.  That's impossible.  We'll talk about that  after this.  Good.  This is the OPNN3 show.  Full house again today.  Kurt Metzger,  first time on the show,  doing a great job.  Going to be at Caroline's  tonight in place  of Tracy Morgan.  We got Jackie  with just a few tickets  left for his big show  at Mohegan Sun.  Yeah,  I'm in place  of Tracy Morgan. 
[02:52:00]  Have you played  the casinos yet?  I've been to Foxwoods,  but I haven't been  to Mohegan Sun,  so I'm looking forward  to it.  I like that casino.  I'm not a big gambler,  but I like the vibe  up there.  It's all right.  I like any casino.  Anthony's a big fan  of casino.  I like any casino.  I like the Mohegan Sun,  but I prefer Foxwoods,  of course.  Foxwoods is your place,  right?  Because they paid me.  Dude,  these people,  I did this Mohegan Sun show,  they told me I'm  co-headlining with...  Oh, shit,  you're going to trash  him.  I'm not going to trash  it, but it's going to 
[02:52:30]  kill Jackie's show  tonight.  Oh, are they really?  No.  I do.  No.  I really,  because I really will  just shoot my mouth off  and fuck it up.  No, that'd be good,  because then I told you  one and we got a  It wasn't Mohegan Sun.  It was whoever I did  this for.  Jackie, your pal's on.  Oh, Bob of Booey's on?  Mohegan Moon.  Duck out of this  Mohegan thing I started.  Gary's promoting his  book, which is doing  very, very well.  Is it?  Yeah?  Yeah.  I read it on the  treadmill.  Did he on purpose 
[02:53:00]  get the author facial  hair going?  My God.  That's hysterical.  Look.  He's got an author  guilty.  I'm an author now.  He's got a salt and  pepper guilty.  I also do an authorize  biographies of homosexual  artists.  Let me, he's got a pipe  and elbow patches as he  goes, let me tell you the  origin of Bob of Booey.  Jackie would love  many years ago.  Did you ever think that  he would be writing a book  there, Jackie?  Yeah, you know, I don't  know.  He had to.  I guess I knew he was 
[02:53:30]  going to, you know, I'm on  the treadmill and I'm reading  about the times I broke  his balls and it's really  fun.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He had Scott the engineer  at his wedding and he  said, all right, Scott, you  could be the, you could be  the DJ at my wedding, but  don't do any of that dopey  shit that you always do.  You know, like the, the  hands up and the, and you  know, the, the different  dopey shit.  The electric slides?  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's fun.  Don't do that.  So we're at the wedding.  So I go and grab Scott and  I say, Scott, Gary had a  complete change of heart.  He wants you to do hands  up.  And all of a sudden Scott's 
[02:54:00]  all excited.  And we're at the Glen  Cove at the, the Met, you  know, that room, the Met  and the, and the DJ booth  was up on a rise.  And all of a sudden Scott's  running up to his DJ booth  with all the glasses and  everything.  And Gary's like, what's he  doing?  And all of a sudden Scott's  got everybody doing it.  Gary wanted to fucking  kill me, man.  Hands up.  Everybody.  Hands up.  Gary and Mary, that was  their fucking nightmare  that Scott would do.  Well, we'll get Scott as 
[02:54:30]  long as he doesn't do that  shit.  And I'm reading about it  in print and I'm saying,  ah, good, good, good.  That's fantastic.  Why would you do that if  he didn't want you to?  Don't get the joke guy.  It's great fun.  And Jimmy's tickets go on  sale in 12 minutes.  Yes.  For January.  I'm glad they had, we  wanted to do a late show  Sunday and they just do  Saturday, which is much  better.  It's a different night.  Wow.  I'm hearing, ah, boy Gary  had a weird mom too, huh? 
[02:55:00]  Yes.  Weird mom.  Fucking, ah.  I'm being polite, yeah.  She was crazy.  I mean, and he talks about  it in the book and he was,  ah.  I might have a little bit  of, how crazy.  I think we have something  in common.  Yeah, yeah, I think.  I think we all do.  Jimmy, Jimmy, do you have a  crazy mom?  Oh, please.  Jimmy interviewed Gary.  I did 40 minutes with him.  Yeah, he was great.  On the Raw Dog show  when I had that, yeah.  Yeah.  And, ah, yeah, he was  very open about it.  He talked about his  brother dying.  It was really, it was great.  The book is really, it's  honest.  It's not just.  He looks so distinguished  on TV now.  What the fuck?  Like, he's got the gray 
[02:55:30]  temples and the.  That's because none of us  are in the room with him.  Is that it?  He is really a gentleman  though.  Like, you know, he's an  author type gentleman.  Author.  I'm like, so what made  you want to do the book  on being Baba Boyd?  He goes, well, you know  the creative process.  No, he was.  His horrible, they're  showing his horrible  throw.  That throw is.  It's legendary.  Is that, it really is  funny.  That passed the Bobby  Thompson thing a long  time ago.  He should have sang the  national anthem on  But did he do it on  purpose?  No.  No.  You never want to 
[02:56:00]  fucking not make that  pitch.  The face gave away that  he didn't.  He turned around.  No one could feign  humiliation like that.  He was just bummed  out.  He fucked up.  Wasn't his kid  standing next to him?  You want to make that  pitch.  You want to make it  look like you're a  major league pitcher.  My girlfriend and I  watched it together.  And I was just howling.  And she goes, oh,  and then she saw the  kid.  She goes, oh, my God,  his kid must have been  so humiliated.  I would never take that.  I can't throw.  And he waited until a  day of internet and 
[02:56:30]  YouTube so that he  would instantly be in  front of every human  being on the planet.  It will never go away.  I was surprised nobody  on Stern Show teased  him about it.  Oh, God.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  It kind of went right  under the radar,  didn't it?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What is fucking better  than a good radio  beating when you fuck  up?  It's like, because  there's hours to kill.  As long as it's not  you, it's terrific.  I can't believe you're  saying that to me.  Jesus Christ.  It's great, though,  right?  What was your best 
[02:57:00]  beating on the radio  there, Jackie?  Of course, the apology.  Oh, God.  What was the apology?  The apology was great.  And the truth of it,  nobody to this, I got a  literary agent, I'm  writing my book, and I'm  most excited about getting  that fucking story out.  The night before we  were going to be, do  our big funeral for  John DeBella, we'd  become number one in  Philadelphia, and so  Howard had a suite, and  we were all in the  suite getting drunk, and  he had Jessica Hahn in  the suite next door, and  he called her up and  said, you know, she  said, Howard, do you  want me to come over?  He said, yeah, come  over and take a bath. 
[02:57:30]  So she came over and  got naked and took a  bath.  And she said, come on,  Howard, come in here  with me.  He said, I can't go in  there, my wife will  kill me.  So me and Billy and  Fred and Gary were all  sitting there.  We'd been drinking all  the way on the bus  from, you know, from  New York to Philly.  So I'm loaded as  hell.  And he says, I can't  get in there.  My wife will kill me.  He says, somebody come  with me.  And I'm like, you know  what?  I'll take a fucking  bullet for the team.  I'm going to leave on  my underwear and my  jeans.  No foul.  So we go over there,  and Howard gets down  to his underwear. 
[02:58:00]  I got on my jeans and  my underwear.  We climb in the  bathtub.  I was behind her.  He was in front of  her, probably 30  seconds.  And I might be  exaggerating.  You know what I  mean?  But the next  morning, at 6 o'clock  in the morning, Howard  let go.  He made it sound, you  know, he's genius.  He made it sound like a  full-scale fucking  orgy went on.  And I never got a  chance to say, by the  way, Jackie had his  blue jeans on.  So Nancy got a hundred  calls from everybody 
[02:58:30]  about, you know, about  this orgy we had.  I think the most  famous thing I ever  heard was, I want to  apologize to my wife.  And that's what it  was.  That line is just  ingrained in people's  heads.  She was going to kill  me.  And it wasn't her  idea.  It was my idea.  The therapist said,  I said, we're going  to Europe.  We have a week's  vacation in Europe.  Her sister's getting  married.  She said, get her on  the plane.  Please don't make a  mockery of it.  Right.  So the first thing  it was, I said,  Howard, it was so  douche chilly.  Give me the air. 
[02:59:00]  And I said, you know,  I just want to  apologize to my wife,  Nancy, you know, and  and it was really  heartfelt.  It was my idea, but  everybody for the next  20 years, what a bitch  she was to beat you  up and make you do  that.  No, but she's still  my good pal.  You know, when he  fucking years, you  took sex for that,  which is strange.  I always find that  strange when someone  could get along with  their act.  I get down.  I'm just saying, I  mean, if it works for  you, great.  We were pals before  we worked together  and then we worked  together and then we  couldn't resist fucking  each other.  So you couldn't 
[02:59:30]  resist fucking her.  She gave in.  She was drunk.  She was asleep.  As you tell that  story, Fran Tarkenton  just walked out.  That's why I snuck  out before to grab  a picture of this.  Fucking legend.  My girlfriend, my  ex-girlfriend and I  are friends too.  And I fucked a  relationship up and  we became friends  again.  And I'm glad.  Sometimes you like  the person.  I'm friends with  all of them.  You've got a lot  of history.  I used to not  with all of them.  I haven't been  with that many  girlfriends.  I'm friends with  one. 
[03:00:00]  That's it.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, friends, I  mean, I'm friendly.  I don't call them  a lot.  No, no, like friends.  Yeah.  With only one.  And that's just  because a couple  of years went by  first.  Yeah.  And then we kind  of became friends  again.  Because right  after, you don't  want to know what  the fuck they're  doing, what  they're talking to,  whatever.  But then after a  while, you could  kind of, you know,  oh, how you been,  whatever.  Yeah, I can't  believe it.  This chick threw  me.  I used to just  live off girlfriends  the whole first  eight years I  lived here.  I'm living in a 
[03:00:30]  office girl.  Every time she  got mad at me,  she would just  throw me out of  the house.  And I'd be like,  homeless.  That'll keep you  in line.  Yeah, I could've  just got my shit  together and moved  out, but I was a  dickhead.  So I stayed out.  This is like when  a telestil drank,  and I stayed out  like all night with  them.  And I get back at  like five, and this  bitch had my  Xbox.  She smashed with a  hammer.  She had my Xbox  and a hammer  laying, like,  proudly.  Like, wanted you  to know exactly  what had happened.  Oh, dude, yeah.  I mean, I didn't  like hit her, dude,  but I remember  like grabbing her  by the throat  and like...  Wow, you really  did? 
[03:01:00]  I mean, I really  didn't, like...  When I think  about it, the  amount of fights  she was getting  in, I could've  just like killed  me.  Just killed her?  I'm so lucky  that I didn't  just go overboard  and do a...  Would you get  physical?  And only if she  got physical  with me first,  because she  would do that.  She would peg me.  You have a  goon armor, girl?  Dude, she  pegged me in the  nuts with a jar of  peanut butter one  time.  I don't want to  suppress you,  but if you  had killed her,  you'd probably  be out by now  and you'd have  a book.  Do you think so?  I'm not savvy  like that.  Think media.  Think media. 
[03:01:30]  Of course.  That is bad, man.  Yeah, we got a  dog with her,  so now we're  friends and I  pick up the dog  like it's a child.  What, like  joint custody?  Yeah.  That's it.  I just got a text.  I got to do this  one.  Need some quick  cash?  You can easily  get $1,200  wired into your  bank account.  Wow.  I got a text  like that the  other day.  For info, just  reply back the  word pay.  Should I do  it?  Can I get my  phone?  I can use  $1,200.  I won't put you  on any lists 
[03:02:00]  where they'll  send more of  those to you.  I got an  email that said  we don't have  the proper  information to  wire the $4,000  into your  account.  Now, I know I  don't have $4,000  coming, but it  was asking me  about my bank  and it had a  replica of the  bank's website.  And I said,  wait a minute.  And I called  the bank and  they said, no,  they're just  trying to get  your information.  Because we're  all optimism.  All you can  think of is a  fucking monopoly.  Bank error in  your favor. 
[03:02:30]  You know what  I mean?  Thank God.  I called  and said, no,  no, don't give  them any fucking  passwords.  You can usually  tell from the  URL you don't  have the S for  secure and  usually the  URL is fucked  up.  Dude, also,  my bank will  send me, or  the phony bank  will send me  something that  looks just like  it.  And you're  supposed to put  in your  password to get  online.  And it's like,  this isn't it.  And they say  they will never  send you anything  asking for your  personal information.  No, but PayPal  did recently, so I  gave it to them.  Oh, good, good. 
[03:03:00]  You know, I  should have been  thinking, because  the email return  address was,  this is not  really your  bank at  this is not  you're really  your bank.com.  Nigerians are  great.  That's how you  know.  You get a little  like, and God  bless you,  that's how you  know immediately  I'm trying to  steal from you.  The spelling or  grammar is a  little off.  You know, you  need to be  have more money.  Do I need to  have more money?  How about when  you get an email  from a friend 
[03:03:30]  that may be an  acquaintance or  a friend that  you know that  you thought you  respected, it's  like all of a  sudden you see  a friend and  then you see  they're wearing  a cross and  like, oh, fuck  me.  Somebody sent  you an email  in capital  letters.  This is real.  I saw it on  the Today Show.  I'm like, oh,  motherfucker.  You get hacked  with a person.  Bam.  Bill Gates is  going to send  you a dollar a  day for the  rest of your  life.  This is real.  It was on  the Today Show.  It's an email  testing thing and  he's going to  send you a  thousand dollars  for a free  iPhone, an  iPad.  You are my  friend, but  now that I  realize you're  a fucking 
[03:04:00]  idiot.  I always go  to Snopes.com.  It gives you  the rumors and  bullshit.  It's happening  and copy-paste,  send it right  back to the  person and  go, here's  what you just  sent me and  here's what  really, what's  the real deal.  You're a nice  guy.  You go to all  that trouble.  I call him a  scumbag.  Do you ever go  on a 319  eater?  And they just  draw these people  out and get  them to send  pictures.  Oh, it's  fantastic.  People could  just string  them on.  Yeah, I just  need a little  more information 
[03:04:30]  about the  money you want  to send me.  Oh, yes, we  be sending you  lots of money.  And how people  fall for this  shit is amazing.  Because they  are making  money.  It's a lot of  religious people,  dude.  A lot of old  people.  Religious people.  People who believe  stuff are believers  down the line.  Oh, really?  Isn't that  preacher's wife  that shot her  husband and  they didn't  know why she  snapped?  Because she  lost their  fucking money  to some guy  that was,  God bless you,  your funds are  coming in.  They just  believe shit.  My mother's  like that.  She's still  religious.  She believes 
[03:05:00]  she was this  asshole Gary  Null or  something for  like vitamin  therapy or  some bullshit.  But every  stupid thing  you could just  believe, you  know, like  vaccination causes  autism,  everything.  Do you talk  to her?  Do you go,  there's nothing  that can be  done.  That's like  how I smoke  pot constantly.  That's her thing.  That's her pot.  My grandmother  said, Jackie,  I sent $10 to  Billy Graham and  he's going to  do a prayer  especially for  me.  And I'm like,  okay,  grandma, you  know, like,  you don't have  $10, but if  he's going to  do a prayer  especially for  you, if it  makes you feel  good. 
[03:05:30]  All of a sudden  she says,  look, look,  he's going to  do it.  And she turns  on the television,  Billy Graham is  in Yankee  Stadium.  It's packed.  And he goes,  and now here's  the prayer for  all you people  that sent  you $10.  And I'm  going,  she turns to  me, and I'm  like, you  can't refute  it because it  made her feel  good.  So what the  fuck?  Shouldn't I get  compensation for  that therapy?  And she dropped  that right on  my face.  But Kurt, you  should tell them  what you used to  do.  Kurt has a very  interesting 
[03:06:00]  backstory.  I was a witness  my whole life,  dude.  So I didn't  like.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So I was like a  minister technically  when I was like  20 and 21  before I went to  college.  Really?  So no Christmas,  no holidays.  Well, that shit,  I mean, I still  this day don't give a  shit about it.  It's really nice.  I don't give a shit  about it, but it's  just kind of  time off.  Well, I have to  do it now.  It's time off from  work.  Who am I kidding?  I don't give a  shit either.  That was the least  bad part of that.  What age did you  start, though?  From birth, dude.  I did my life.  So you didn't  know any better?  Yeah.  And then what  changed that made  you go, fuck that?  I went to college 
[03:06:30]  and started fucking  pussy.  I mean, it wasn't  like.  I don't know it.  You know.  Always.  I was so ashamed  of myself.  Yeah.  It's like what  Taurus witness  always wins out.  It's really amazing  how well that works.  Look at it.  You really got to  stay in that  environment.  Jehovah's Snatch.  Yeah.  All right, I'm in.  Oh, my God.  It's like the Amish.  When they lose  their fucking minds.  Rummestella or  something.  Yeah, rumspring.  But they give them  a rumspring.  They give them a  month or something  like that.  Yeah, but it's  not a fair.  It's like when Spock  does that amok time.  Dude, it's such a 
[03:07:00]  fake.  And loses his  fucking shit and  has to fuck  something.  Yeah, he turns  all evil.  But it's a false  choice, dude.  So you're sheltered  from everything,  like the world  they call it.  And they go,  you don't want to  be out there  where it's so  terrible.  So those Amish  kids, they go,  so you're terrible.  They've been in a  fucking farm their  whole life.  And it's scary to  go somewhere for  fucking two days.  Of course you're  going to run home.  So you run home.  Yeah, like of  course you're going  to do it.  It's not a real  fucking choice.  But at least one  thing about Jehovah's  Witnesses is they  don't get involved in  politics and they're  not after your money.  So there's two 
[03:07:30]  things that kind of  sets them apart.  When they knock on  that door, though,  motherfucker, I just  want to fucking  kill them.  Well, that's, yeah,  of course.  Well, they're only,  because it's like,  it's like almost  like a good marketing  thing, because the  people are going to  be happy you knock  on that door.  Does anyone go,  wow, thank God  you're here?  I was really  looking for this.  A lot of people  do, right?  There's people  that are sitting  there like, because  just if you hit the  odds and you're like,  oh, Lord, send me  a message, you might  get a little knock  knock if, you know,  if they cover enough  area, you know what  I mean? 
[03:08:00]  Were you a knock  knock guy?  Oh, yeah, dude,  from when I was  like six.  Oh, six?  Yeah.  Did you get used  to the rejection?  He's got inverted  nipples from people  going, get the  fuck out.  I really do have  inverted nipples,  by the way.  Now you know  why.  I never realized  why I had that.  You ever have  knocking, you ever  see like the  magazines, like the  watch out and wait,  you show up and  in the magazine, 
[03:08:30]  like the hook is  you hold up the  man, you're like,  would you like to  live in a place  like this?  And then there's  like a, you know,  like a table of  fruits and vegetables  and like they're  high-fiving a  dolphin or something  great.  And then like,  you're like, of  course I would.  It looks like  Hawaii.  And you're like,  oh, I'd love to  live there.  And then that's  how you're supposed  to shoehorn the  rest of it.  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  Wow.  I mean, they  didn't believe in  like hell, too.  I'll give them  that.  It's not like  some of these  fucking born-again  religions where  you're going to,  you know,  it's not like we  told people  they're going to  be tortured  for not being a  member.  I think as long  as you find a  priest on your  deathbed,  you're fine,  though.  There you go. 
[03:09:00]  That's what I'm  counting on.  Yeah, that's the  ultimate.  I hope he doesn't  get stuck in  traffic.  Isn't it amazing,  by the way,  how unfair that  shit works?  No kidding.  It's ridiculous.  Fucking Jeffrey  Dahmer's going to  heaven according to  his fucking  Pentecostal,  but my grandmother  is in hell right  now because she  forgot to do it  the born-again way.  Right.  But Dahmer did it,  so that's how  the rules work.  I'm not a big  fan of organized  religion.  My father was  never religious,  but he had a  minister right there  when he passed  away.  The fucking  minister was  standing on his  oxygen hose. 
[03:09:30]  I'm sorry,  I've got to get  in a few stupid  jokes.  I like that  shit.  I like that  shit.  Jimmy?  Jimmy's holding  his nose.  No, I'm not.  He hates my  jokes.  Not at all.  No, you were  like this.  No, I had my  hands cupped over  the mic.  You know what?  You all right?  Yes.  I didn't think it  had anything to do  with Jack yet.  No.  I think it had  something to do  with what you  were looking at.  I don't know if  Kurt, you know  this, but my  grandfather was  one of the  survivors of the  Titanic.  Did you know  that?  No, I didn't. 
[03:10:00]  He was in his  room fucking  an inflatable  doll.  What luck.  Wow.  What a wonderful  story for a  convention of  Jehovah's Witnesses.  That must have  been tough, though.  Were you ever jealous  as a kid, though?  The only thing that  sucked is you go to  meetings three nights  a week, then you  have these conventions  and be in Philly at  fucking Veterans  Stadium in the open  sun, and they just  go for like five  fucking hours, and  then they wanted you  to take notes. 
[03:10:30]  My mother was such  a fucking bitch about  me taking notes of  this dumb shit.  What?  Jesus is good.  You got it, Mom.  I'm on it.  Oh, my God.  Was it competitive?  Like, all the people  went door to door?  Like, how many did you  get?  How many did you get?  It just breaks down  like every other thing.  There's like a little  hierarchy within a...  So, like, the pioneers  are the ones who do  that shit all day.  Oh, that's Eddie.  He can really knock on  a door.  Yeah, so there was like  clicks of whatever.  Then there was like a  click of like cool  Jehovah's Witnesses  kids that were like  getting tattoos and  doing bad shit secretly 
[03:11:00]  that I was never cool  enough to hang out with.  You paid attention  to the rules.  You were good.  I didn't just know  I wouldn't have.  It turns out I wasn't  good like as soon as  somebody gave me the  opportunity to get the  fuck out.  Yeah, I was just  rejected.  Like, I totally would  have broken the rules  and I was just like...  But you're a big guy.  He must have scared  the shit out of people  when he knocked  in the door.  I was a pussy.  They raised you to be  a pussy, dude.  So, yeah.  You declawed like a  declawed cat at an  early age.  But you're not a pussy.  That's obvious.  So, you discover pussy,  actual pussy, and that's 
[03:11:30]  my mom was...  Well, a lot of people's  families don't talk to  them, but I mean, I was  like, basically, go fuck  yourselves if you don't  like it.  Like, I'm not...  I wanted to do stand...  I started doing stand-up  and I liked it so much  that I didn't really  give a shit.  So, but my mom came  around.  She didn't like not talk.  That would have hurt  her way worse.  Is she still doing it?  Yeah.  Yeah, she stayed there.  And your dad's not in  the picture?  My dad died.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  But that kind of ruined  him.  Like, my dad, he didn't do  what he wanted with his  life, I always felt like,  and he just, like,  drank himself to death  and he got kicked out  of the religion because  he was such an alcoholic.  Kicked out of the  religion? 
[03:12:00]  Jesus.  Yeah, you get  disfellowshipped if you're  too much of a fucking  disgrace.  Disfellowshipped?  Disfellowshipped.  Oh, disfellowshipped?  Like, shunned or...  That sounds fucked up.  He was going door-to-door  knocking and saying,  have you got any Budweiser?  That's how you  fuck Jehovah.  Fuck Jehovah, I'm  thirsty.  Oh, God damn.  I'll give you a fucking  pamphlet for a shot.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, man.  All have our crosses  to bear, don't we?  So to speak. 
[03:12:30]  So to speak.  Jimmy Howard tickets?  I don't know, but they  are on sale now.  Right now.  Right the fuck now.  Now.  Get them.  Where?  Where?  Where?  How can they get them?  The Borgata.com.  Sell, sell, sell.  Borgata.com.  Also, my Boston  Wilbur Theatre show is  on sale at noon today,  and San Francisco for  March is on sale  tomorrow morning.  Right.  Wow.  And gentlemen,  would you like to  please tell people  where you're going to be?  Caroline's on Broadway,  tonight at 8.  For Kurt Metzger.  You can see me  substitute headline if you want.  Substitute headline.  And I just wanted to  jump in here. 
[03:13:00]  Kurt, very funny guy,  and he works with the show.  We look forward to  having you back, sir.  Cool.  Thanks, buddy.  Real funny comic,  and he'll be at Caroline's  tonight in place of  Tracy Morgan.  He's doing Greg Charles  a favor, so if you're  in the area, please  stop by and check it out.  You're not going to be  disappointed.  And then Jackie's got  that sold-out show  at Mohegan Sun.  We don't even have to  promote that, right, Jackie?  Don't even have to.  What are you there?  Tonight, tomorrow, both?  No, just Saturday night  at 8 o'clock and  December 15th at  the Rainwater Grill  up in Hastings-on-Hudson.  I'm doing a benefit  for the Broadway 
[03:13:30]  Training Center,  and I have a date  with Carol Baker.  Oh, you do.  Carol Baker, like in  Marilyn Monroe  and Jane Mansfield.  She's like 80 years old now.  Oh, wow.  So you're going on a date?  Her daughter, Blanche Baker,  is an actress,  and she's a good friend of mine.  So I actually am going up  to have a date with Carol Baker.  Look at you.  She was above...  After the Cougars.  She was above Jimmy Stewart  in How the West Was Won.  Oh, wow.  Jackie, would you?  What?  Would you?  Just for the story?  Have I, you mean?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Would you?  I French kissed Florence Henderson. 
[03:14:00]  I had a hard-eyed  and the fucking midget  could have swung.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is she sexy in person?  Oh, no.  No.  The truth is,  she was 70 years old.  She was absolutely adorable  and an incredible kisser.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  It was like a college girlfriend.  How did you make out with her?  How did you do that?  I was in a movie  and we were the background of,  you know,  her grandson was doing  a racetrack deal  and I was her boyfriend  and we had to be making out.  She was licking mustard  and ketchup off my face  and we're making out  and eating hot dogs. 
[03:14:30]  We did it for, like,  you know,  five different takes  times three different camera angles  with just, you know,  making out and making out.  Venus in Vegas.  It's going to be out in DV.  It was three years ago.  It's finally going to be out.  Venus in Vegas.  It'll probably be  on Comedy Central  in the afternoon.  Just a clip of me.  And there's a rumor going on.  No, I did not finger her.  Ah, why not?  Because that is the rumor.  Because she smacked my hand away.  What are you stupid?  I saw that on TMZ.  I got to make out  with Nina Hartley,  the porn chick,  in a comedy.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:15:00]  With Brewer and Otto.  Yeah, that was good.  American dummy.  It was fun.  She was so sexy.  She grabbed my cock.  We went into the dressing room.  It was a comic strip.  And I'm like,  at the end,  Louis Black was supposed  to be her husband.  And I'm like,  I didn't want to be  a creep to a porn girl  because I'm like,  everyone probably treats  her like a fucking piece of meat.  So I'm like,  I never kissed on camera.  I'm like,  are we supposed to,  do I use tongue?  I really didn't know.  Do you really do it right?  And she goes,  come here, man.  She goes,  we're supposed to be  attracted to each other.  And we just started kissing  in the dressing room. 
[03:15:30]  She starts making out with me.  She fucking grabbed my cock.  Oh, this is no cameras going.  This is before the cameras.  She's like,  we're supposed to be  comfortable with each other.  And then when we actually  did it in the camera,  she's got a fucking,  she takes,  she's like,  come on,  you know you want to.  And she took my hand  and put it on her tip.  She was great.  She was very turned on.  That's like a sexy girl.  Yeah, yeah.  It was being really sexy girl.  I could use that later.  That's nice.  Yeah.  My wife's got an,  my wife's got an ass  in her cock.  Remember that?  And they left it in.  I guess that's it for today. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Let's figure out  this McCartney thing.  Oh, yeah.  Stick around for the  Paul McCartney tickets.  Opin entry.  The Opin entry show  on the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
