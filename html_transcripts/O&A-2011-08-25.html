<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, hosted by Anthony Cumia and Jim Norton with Opie on vacation, opened with discussions about Hurricane Irene and its potential impact, particularly on Anthony's home and its recurring basement flooding.  They found amusement in local commercials, specifically those for Gary's Gutters and a Bronx furniture store.  The show featured a roster of guests including Rich Voss, Bob Kelly, Bill Schultz, Andy Levy, Alexis Ford, and later Jerry Springer and Alison Waite.

A significant portion of the show focused on Rich Voss's recent condo fire, with Voss providing a chaotic and frequently interrupted account of the incident, punctuated by his eating an egg sandwich.  The cause remained unclear, with speculation ranging from a discarded cigarette to other possibilities.  The hosts and Voss engaged in numerous crude jokes throughout the narrative, often targeting Voss's wife and the firefighters.  This discussion intertwined with other topics, including Vossâ€™s insensitive reaction to the fire, his relationship with Bonnie, and a scam involving a gem-mining trip (later clarified as being in upstate New York, not North Carolina).  The hosts also heavily criticized Mayor Bloomberg's handling of the upcoming 10th anniversary memorial for 9/11 victims and expressed opinions on the planned mosque nearby.

The show included lengthy tangents,  a nonsensical and incomprehensible 34-second interview with Jerry Springer in studio, and crude jokes about a look-alike competition in China.  Steve Jobs' resignation from Apple and his health (mentioning his pancreatic cancer) were discussed, alongside offensive speculation about Walt Disney's alleged anti-Semitism.  The hosts also engaged in a debate about the existence of God and the Devil, employing offensive language and generalizations.  A hypothetical move by Anthony to Texas was extensively debated, with calls from Texas residents contributing to the discussion.  The hosts also mentioned the upcoming "Bobo extravaganza,"  recalling a hilarious past segment featuring Patrice O'Neal's reaction to Bobo.  A promotional contest for a "dream date" with Daniel Bobo, sponsored by Trojan condoms, was also discussed.  The conversation frequently digressed into discussions of prison etiquette.

Andy Levy's Twitter feud with Chris Brown,  a humorous exchange with Alec Baldwin about 9/11 conspiracy theories, and a contentious back-and-forth with Bobby Kelly about Red Eye's ratings were also prominent discussion points.  Playboy Playmate Alexis Ford appeared as a guest, leading to sexually explicit conversations and crude jokes about her work, body modifications, and personal life, with the hosts engaging in extensive, often crass questioning regarding her physical attributes and sexual experiences.  Numerous attempts at physical interaction between the hosts and Alexis Ford, ranging from playful to suggestive, occurred.  The recurring jokes throughout the broadcast included obsessive discussion of bodily functions, repeated insults and name-calling between the hosts, and consistent sexual innuendo and explicit language.

The after-show involved Nicole and Rich Davis, Kid Kelly, and Paul.  It began with a recounting of a conflict between Nicole and Stan, resulting in Stan's ejection from the office.  Kid Kelly's humorous, nonsensical interjections, including the cryptic phrase "FRZ," were featured.  Discussions covered Opie's vacation and the hurricane, Danny and Derek's surprising joint vacation, and a comedic roasting of Rich Voss and Bob Kelly.  The perceived inaccuracies in Eric Nagel's storytelling were a running theme, along with his disputes about his background.  Troy's largely uncelebrated birthday and Sam Roberts' interview with Mick Foley were also briefly discussed.  Finally, Playboy Playmate Alison Waite promoted a Macanudo cigar contest, including a trip to Las Vegas, and a playful negotiation for a hug between Troy and Alison ensued.  The entire after-show, like the main broadcast, was filled with profanity, insults, and personal anecdotes.  The show concluded with the usual plugs for upcoming appearances and social media accounts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control.  Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Oh, you're going to have a ball.  Yeah, you're going to have a ball.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[00:04:00]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  He's the co-host of this very program sitting here to my right, James Norton Esquire.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  It's indeed the Opie and Anthony show, and Opie's on vacation for whatever.  That's worth a vacation.  Wow. 
[00:04:30]  Holy shit.  He has a hurricane magnet in his pocket.  That fucker.  Oh, my God.  I guess that's the big story.  The big story.  Hurricane Irene.  Barreling down.  Is that one of the words they use on the news?  Barreling down, setting course for taking aim on.  There are a lot of ways the news likes to put it.  Irene ready to take the Outer Banks, I guess. 
[00:05:00]  Going through Bahamas now, causing major, as they said, major damage.  But it is the Bahamas.  They're kind of used to it, right?  Yeah, I'm sure the Atlantis is fine.  You know, all those nice resorts.  I'm sure they're fine.  But if you've ever driven from the airport in Nassau to Paradise Island, Bahamas, the Atlantis  resort, you'll see all the places that get blown away during these hurricanes.  And they're pretty much made of sheet metal, corrugated steel, and wood. 
[00:05:30]  They've never read The Three Little Pigs.  They've never read that book because they build it out of straw and wood instead of steel.  A lot of churches, they said, the roofs have blown off of houses and windows bashed apart.  How high are the winds?  I guess they're up to 1.15.  It's supposed to go to a category, what, category four? 
[00:06:00]  Is there a cat five?  Finger to God.  I tried watching some of that movie.  It's so bad.  Dude, I just couldn't get, even ironically, I couldn't get through it.  Not even ironically?  No.  I've reached the point where it's only irony, and I have to watch it.  It's so bad.  Yeah, it's that bad.  It is like heroin.  It's like, I know it's bad.  I know it's bad for me, but I just can't. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, yeah, the extremes.  They'll rue the day they come against the extreme.  Total ruage.  He did that.  Yes, he did.  Total ruage.  Yeah.  They're in their shitty vehicles, and the sponsored Storm team has their badass black SUVs, and  it's, you know, the guy from Princess Bride or something, or the other one, I don't know,  from Saw.  Total ruage.  Total ruage.  Total ruage. 
[00:07:00]  Maybe Opie's going to ride this thing out.  Ride in the storm out.  Yeah.  Here's what Opie's going to do.  He's going to ride out the basement as the fucking roof is blown off.  Yes.  It is supposed to be quite a damaging storm.  And they're saying this could be one of the worst ones that we get here in the Northeast,  I'm talking about, New York area, Connecticut, Jersey.  Can I name any other states? 
[00:07:30]  How about Massachusetts?  How about Rhode Island?  You can name that.  And then the central Atlantic states, where Opie is, that's going to take a big hit.  But they're saying this one could rival one of the storms that was, I guess, over 50 years  ago.  I can't remember the name, but it's some broads name.  And it's making a swath towards New York, and depending whether it goes east or west,  and they're saying a little more westerly track than New York City, which goes right over  my house.  So I'm making this about me. 
[00:08:00]  No, I don't care.  All I have to fucking watch out for is that basement door I have downstairs.  You know, outside my house, I have an outdoor, you know, the little stairway that goes into  a little stairwell, and then you have your utility door for your basement.  That thing is filled up like a fucking watertight door on a sinking ship.  That whole, like, place where it's against the door and leaking, like, under the door.  I'm there with a wet vac, you know, trying to get the water out. 
[00:08:30]  I've installed a pump.  Why does it leak?  Pump doesn't fucking pump it out fast enough.  It just, it fills the whole stairwell up with water.  To the point where I've seen it flooded, and thank God it's all cement over there.  It's like a utility room instead of the nicely posh carpeted area of the bathroom, of the  basement.  But it fills up, and then once the water level goes down, I've actually seen, like, tidal  marks on the door where the debris and dirt will settle in a line around where the highest 
[00:09:00]  point of the water got.  And it's been almost halfway up the door.  But it's sealed so well because it's, like, weather-stripped rubber seal because it goes  to outside that it hasn't come in very quickly.  But I'm afraid that this hurricane is really going to do some damage.  Can't you seal the outside door?  I have to in some way, shape, or form before the weekend.  I think there's a problem with my gutters, though.  I think they have to be cleaned because the water kind of pours over the edge of the gutter  like a waterfall and helps fill that area up.  And I think without that happening, I might be a little better. 
[00:09:30]  So maybe I should call Gary's Gutters.  Call Gary's Gutters.  That's the name for gutterance.  You ever seen that commercial?  It's local.  Sorry, motherfuckers that don't live around here, but that's how it works sometimes.  There's this guy, Gary's Gutters, and he does the worst possible commercials.  And one is an 80s rap kind of thing.  Here he is.  Turn.  Installs, too.  That's not all we do.  Look at that.  When your roof starts acting up, you just might need it.  Run, rush, give us a call. 
[00:10:00]  Don't wait another minute.  No.  Chimney cleaning, caps and more power washing.  Power washing.  He shakes back and forth.  Maintenance, too.  Y'all don't despair.  It's Gary's Gutters.  The name to call for gutter shields and gutter install.  It's Gary's Gutters.  The name to call for gutter shields and gutter install.  Look at him.  He's just a white guy.  All dressed up like an 80s rapper.  Yeah, he's pretty hateable, but.  He's, I hate him, but I can't stop.  Every time the commercial comes on, I gotta stop and watch it. 
[00:10:30]  But it works, too.  You remember the name.  Oh, you certainly do.  If Bill Tetley was a product, I'd be worth $300 million right now.  So why don't you get it done before the weekend?  I am.  They're coming Friday.  Not Gary.  Why not Gary?  I know.  You know what?  I'd be a little starstruck.  Yeah.  Because I would want Gary to show up himself.  Yeah.  And I know that isn't going to happen.  See if he can come in a Sir Mix-A-Lot outfit or something.  I know.  He'd probably do it.  I'd pay him extra.  There's an, oh yeah, this one, this one's not as good.  You know what, though?  You know what?  You know what?  Local commercial I'm digging now? 
[00:11:00]  We're talking corner furniture.  Oh, yeah.  See that guy?  He's got some furniture store in the middle of the Bronx, I think.  It just looks like, who the fuck would go there?  I think the looters just go there and sell their shit to this guy.  I don't know for sure.  But yeah, look at him.  He did his own commercial.  Living rooms, bed rooms, dinettes, oh yeah, come shop with us.  Be sure we're talking corner furniture.  You want the best, forget about the rest.  You're like us. 
[00:11:30]  We're sure we're talking corner furniture.  It doesn't even fit.  It's really a shame that the white guy's a better rapper who does gutters than this guy.  He goes, you got it.  We need it.  Oh, yeah.  Let's dance.  Let's dance.  We're talking corner furniture.  The second I go broke, we're going to light it on fire.  They're going to collect the insurance money.  They're talking corner furniture.  Little Jewish lightning.  I love the local commercials, man.  I can't get enough of that shit. 
[00:12:00]  They're fantastic.  What day is the strong coming?  I guess they're right in the storm.  Saturday, we're supposed to get some wind and some rain, a little bit.  And then Sunday is supposed to be the day where it can really get fucked up, depending on where it goes.  It's still down at the Bahamas.  I guess they're getting better at figuring out which way the wind's blowing and which way the jet stream's going and shit like that.  But I don't know.  It seems to me like they really don't know for sure. 
[00:12:30]  And just 100 miles one way or the other makes a huge difference with these things.  So until it gets a little closer, I think until it hits the Mid-Atlantic or doesn't, we really don't know for sure.  But we're going to catch something.  I think we're getting something.  We're getting some shitty weather.  That's pretty much it.  If I wasn't on vacation next week, I'd be very angry that my weekend was shot by this.  And speaking of shot, I have to talk with our lovely guest, Bill Schultz and Andy Levy, coming in today, coming in later. 
[00:13:00]  At 8.30, thank you.  That's right.  I wouldn't know it's not on my sheet.  Oh, shit.  I got a new sheet that I am loving.  You have a handwritten sheet.  This one is, well, they wrote in the time, but this is all I need.  Like, I don't like separate sheets for everybody where it says Rich Voss will be coming in at 7, right?  And Bob Kelly's coming in at 7.  And then there's a separate sheet that has this whole big, long thing of, like, Rich Voss.  Rich Voss is a comedian that has been on the opiate.  It's right there.  You know, we know. 
[00:13:30]  I know.  So now it's one sheet right here says Rich Voss.  And this is a big day.  This is a heavy day.  That's right.  Rich Voss, 7.  Bob Kelly, 7.  Bill Schultz and Andy Levy, 8.30.  And Alexis Ford at 9.30.  And all I got is Rich Voss tomorrow night and Saturday, Governors in Leviton.  Go to govs.com.  Bob Kelly tomorrow night, Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey.  Uncle Vinny's, comedyclub.com.  It's easy, right?  Andy Schultz and Bill Levy.  No, Bill Schultz and Andy Levy. 
[00:14:00]  And I'm supposed to say co-host of Fox News' Red Eye.  I've been told by Fox to introduce them in that way.  Which I'm not.  I'm going to introduce Andy as Twitter troublemaker, Andy Levy.  And Alexis Ford, Penthouse Magazine, alexisford.net.  That's all I need, though.  Right?  One sheet.  It's called a one sheet.  But sometimes you might want a little bit more plug information.  That should be on a separate sheet.  Yes.  A separate sheet stapled and collated. 
[00:14:30]  See, I like...  I need them collated.  I disagree.  I want more sheets.  I think Anthony's simplistic view is not working on this program.  Works with my life.  I need...  Bar, go home, sleep, wake up, drink, pass out.  Everything bad.  I want a separate sheet for each person.  And I would like it in a Trapper Keeper notebook.  A Trapper Keeper.  Can we get Jimmy a Trapper Keeper from now on?  Every day we'll fill his Trapper Keeper with whatever the show information is.  I want photos and bios and synopses. 
[00:15:00]  I want a dossier of every guest dating back to their elementary school days.  If every day Opie had a pile of papers and Anthony had a pile of papers and Jim, just  in front of his position, had the Norton Trapper Keeper updated.  The Norton Trapper Keeper opens it up, sorting through pockets.  And I have a surf that only works for me who will open it for me and peruse through it.  A surf?  Yes.  Want one of those?  Yes.  Nice.  Make sure there's fresh Velcro on it every day.  Oh.  Yeah.  You need it.  Exactly.  Well, you're walking around with a bunch of it on your head. 
[00:15:30]  That's not nice.  Yeah.  So I guess Sunday is when it's going to hit.  Point is, it won't affect us.  I'm going to see my friend Anthony this weekend.  We're going to watch a little fighting.  It won't affect that event.  We're going to watch the UFC, the brawling.  Just me and Anthony's bed.  That's right.  Under the comforter.  It is where one of the good TVs are in the bedroom, so why wouldn't we just snuggle up  and watch the fight together like that?  And do as we like to say, tug each other's kettlebells.  How uncomfortably awkward would that be? 
[00:16:00]  Trying to like, oh, wow, look at that.  Nice, nice job.  Oh, boy, he's down on the mat.  As the covers are just going, fwaka, fwaka, fwaka, fwaka.  And you'd always know who was rooting for who, but whose dick went soft during certain  points of the fight.  Oh, that's traumatizingly awful.  That's horrible.  That Mars watches.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  That Mars watches.  Ah, Mars, come over. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy's coming over.  That'll be cool.  And it's supposed to rain Saturday, but it doesn't matter.  The pool's very warm.  So, you know, I don't mind a little misting rain in a nice, warm, heated pool with my friend  James Norton and some snacks.  Oh, I talked to Voss.  I said, you know, it's not my house.  I shouldn't be inviting people to answer the house.  Oh, invite Voss.  But I said to Rich, because him and Bonnie are at the cellar.  I'm like, dude, why don't you, you know, if you're in Long Island, come by.  I mean, I would love to have, I'm sure, see you.  I certainly would.  What do you do there? 
[00:17:00]  What do you do there?  I'm like, we're just friends.  We hang out.  We perform.  What do you do?  Talk.  We just bullshit.  We sit in the jacuzzi, yap.  What?  Why would you do that?  He doesn't understand.  He doesn't understand why we would go in a pool or why we would sit in a jacuzzi and just  hang out and talk.  Yeah.  I say, I'm like, I know the flow chart, but I'm like, you absolutely were molested in  the tub or pool, you no affection idiot.  He's Jewish.  You could just say it's a schvitz or something.  Call it like a, we'll take a soak or a schvitz. 
[00:17:30]  Something like that.  He'd be like, oh, that's okay.  Then I'll do it.  He's not coming over, is he?  I don't know.  He might actually.  Is something free there?  No, but he might actually, because he might think that it will help his career somehow.  Oh, yeah.  That's not coming over my ass.  Voss is very warm.  He might think that.  Bonnie, by the way, was fucking beautiful the other night.  Really?  She looked great.  Yeah.  She is a pretty girl.  And if she gussies herself up, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, she was fantastic.  Voss way out of his league with that one.  Mentally and physically.  Yes.  In every respect, we knew it.  We knew it right from the get-go, as they say.  He's absolutely, she's a really hot, smart chick.  He's just a blithering idiot with great abs.  Adult.  I think she finds him entertaining, and not in the way he would like.  Right.  She laughs at him, and rightly so.  So do we.  They're really on together.  They're like, I don't know if she'll, they're really weird to watch, but they really have 
[00:18:30]  when they're not a good marriage.  Like, they make fun of each other.  Like, me and Mike, could you and your chick ever, like, I could never say the things to  a girl I'm dating the way he does with her.  No, not to that extent.  And it just works.  It's weird.  It's weird.  And she bashes him, and it's really, they just, they seem to have this fucking great  thing going.  I think it is good if you could, you know, goof on, on your, your chick, and she goofs  on you a little bit.  Not, maybe not to that extent.  It works with them.  Yeah.  But, uh, because the second you slip over that line and say something, the girl's just,  ooh, boy, it's over. 
[00:19:00]  I know.  Wow.  I wonder if he has.  Yeah, you think he's probably said something.  I want to ask her.  But he said shit about her pussy and fucking other guys, and so, like, how much worse can  he get?  Dude, the night of the fire, he calls me, I'm at the red-eye party.  For, uh, uh, was it for Bill Schultz?  Uh, Andy.  And, uh, yeah, Andy's birthday.  And, uh, Vos calls me, and he goes, I'm freaking out, I'm in the airport.  I think he was in Sacramento.  And he was telling me, my house burned.  You know, tonight it happened.  And he's fucking freaking out.  I bet.  And they didn't know where it started, and he goes, well, it was either in the, on the  balcony, or, uh, it could have been in Bonnie's pussy, because that's dry enough. 
[00:19:30]  And I'm like, he just, at all moments, is a funny guy.  He has to make the joke.  If anybody wants to know what a definition of a funny person is, that's what it is.  Yeah.  A guy who wants to cry, but he can't, so he just makes fun.  His wife's pussy.  I'm glad he's coming in, because we haven't talked to him about this, and, uh, we haven't  really gotten any details secondhand from anybody else, so I'm kind of curious, uh, what happened  in his little condo.  Uh, but I, I know, I know, I, I guess Travis was there once. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  You were at the condo.  And all I heard about was his giant couch.  His giant antique couch that doesn't fit the room that it was in.  Yeah.  It was a giant antique couch.  It was too big, too old.  Uh, the whole place looked like Grandma's place, I guess.  It had Grandma's house.  Antiques, but they're not, like, antiques that are cool to have.  No, it's like those paintings that you find at, like, garage sales that are in frames that  are just too big and gaudy.  Yeah, with gold leaf on them and, and shit like that. 
[00:20:30]  And, uh...  How does he decorate?  Mercifully.  Not well.  All burnt.  Oh, God.  Bonnie got just tired of looking at the fucking shit this idiot thought was fashionable.  And when a dopey husband buys shit and packs your house with it, you light a match.  Bonnie and her friends were all just lighting it and talking and she's sitting outside.  I'm trying to burn this idiot, Hendry.  Help me.  Yeah, so Voss, uh, coming out later, we'll, we'll talk to him about that.  Very curious.  What's going on? 
[00:21:00]  What are you doing?  Like, there's a, a, a storm, uh, and, and, and your place is just boarded up.  I guess there's water damage from the hoses, though.  What am I talking about?  You might get some water in there.  There's fire hoses that were squirting, uh, in there.  You don't need more, though.  How do you fix a fire?  You, there's no, you, you, you'd think you'd always go in and go,  Ugh, it just smells like fire.  I've wondered, like, when the towers got hit, if one of them had stood, like, just say that  they had, like, the, the, the, what would have had to have happened, that building wouldn't 
[00:21:30]  have survived.  They would have had to go in and literally just take it down.  Take it down, yeah.  From the middle of the building up.  They couldn't have fucking salvaged that.  Fire damage is fucking horrible, man.  Or just completely demolish it like Jesse thought it happened.  Oh, you know what?  Yeah.  Fuck, I, I guess that's what they would have had to do.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I, I, I, but we're driving in.  I can see the, the Freedom Tower now.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Driving in the, the expressway, you look over and you just see the lights, uh, the construction  lights.  And, uh, yeah, it's, it's sort of getting to the point.  I think it's, I think it's taller than anything in the area already. 
[00:22:00]  It's kind of getting there where it's poking over the tops of whatever buildings I can  see in the morning.  I drove by it last weekend and they've got all the glass getting up, like, up to, like,  the 72nd floor, I think.  Yeah, that's all, it's going to be 72 floors?  No, that's, that's all they've built so far.  Yeah.  And they put the glass up that far.  There's a 90 story fucking building going up on, on, uh, right by Carnegie Hall.  90 story, and there's going to be penthouse, 90 floors, commercial.  I'm sorry, uh, residential.  They're only two foot floors, though. 
[00:22:30]  They're two foot tall.  See, that's, they're very afraid of tall buildings.  It's actually, it sits, you're right, it sits under the Carnegie awning.  It's very, it's a lovely little place.  Yeah, it's very tiny.  Penthouse view is $1.70 a month.  But it's, uh, they, they show what the view is going to be like, and that's 90 stories.  So I know that the Freedom Tower, they didn't want to build so high because nobody put, it's  like, there's other buildings that are going up that are as high now.  But, you know, yeah, I, I mean, 10 more stories, really. 
[00:23:00]  I think they should have fucking, at least put the, if they're going to make the tower higher,  then they should have put it, uh, made it the tallest building in the country.  They're going to cheat with that spire, and, uh, they got some giant pointy thing going  on top of it to make it look taller, and technically it'll be taller, but, man.  It's not going to be like, let me see, it's 1,776 feet or some dumb shit?  Yeah.  I don't know where they got that number from.  Now dumb callers will call and go, dummy, that's from 1776, the year. 
[00:23:30]  No wonder I don't take calls.  How about 1812?  That's a good year.  That's good, too.  What, 2000, 2001.  How about the Burge?  Make it taller than the Burge.  Yeah.  Everyone's scared.  Yeah.  They were scared to, uh, build it any taller.  But it is kind of cool to actually see it going up.  I guess the, a lot of controversy with this, um, the ceremony going on, uh, for people that  are being excluded, um, some of the first responders, I guess, being excluded. 
[00:24:00]  Not allowed down there, uh, to take part in the, uh, in the festivities.  I guess if you want, you don't want to call them festivities, I guess.  Not very festive.  The, um, commemoration, the, what would you call it, Sam?  Uh, dedication?  Dedicate.  No, it's not really.  It's just a 10-year, um, memorial.  Memorial.  Memorial.  10-year, uh, event.  Memorial events.  Ceremony.  Ceremony.  That's a good one.  Party?  No.  Party?  No. 
[00:24:30]  Celebration?  No.  Yeah.  Mixer?  Um, 10-year.  Mixer.  A mixer.  They don't, they don't, yeah, they don't want to include the first responders that were  down there.  And then, uh, Bloomberg is saying no, uh, no clergy is allowed.  And every year they've done some kind of a prayer thing, uh, which, you know, I'm not  religious, but, uh, to not allow that.  And then in the same breath, uh, not the same breath, he might've breathed once or twice  in between.  But he said, uh, he brought up again the, the, the mosque going up very nearby and said, um, 
[00:25:00]  that that's a total go.  And I just can't fucking stand Bloomberg.  He stinks.  I, I really despise his, uh, he's very out of touch with what, with people who he represents  one.  And he's a fuck, he's not a bad, I'm saying he's not a terribly, he's a smart guy, but  I just, I hate his fucking arrogance for his vision of the city, regardless of how impractical  and unpleasant it is for regular people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It makes me sick. 
[00:25:30]  The mosque down there is a terrible idea.  I mean, I mean, it's a little farther away than I think it is.  I'm sure that the other people blew it into proportion, out of proportion of the way.  It's actually really floating in one of the, uh, lakes, in the footprints of the towers.  It's a floating mosque.  I'm sure he wouldn't have a problem with that.  He wouldn't.  He's so groveling.  He's a groveling, groveling guy.  Sniveling.  Sniveling mayor.  And then the people that he does have power over, which are the, uh, average Jews and  truck drivers and fucking regular people.  They're the people he bullies. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  But he can be bullied by anyone else.  He's apologetic.  I believe he is a self-hating Jew.  Of the self-hating variety.  Uh, and, and he's just, he's despicable.  And I can't wait till he's out of office.  Thank you.  When he said, when he said, uh, after that bomb went off, when he goes, if I had 25 cents  and he guessed that it could be someone, a domestic here who's against healthcare reform,  I, I just handed him to a point where it's like, A, if you, if you really think that  you're as, you're the dumbest motherfucker I've ever heard. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  You're going for the long shot with that one.  Or you're a liar.  Or you're just that out of touch that you're trying to say something that you think is  different.  Yeah.  And not stereotypical.  Because you don't want to stereotype.  You know what?  It, it absolutely could have been.  Sure.  Odds were it wasn't.  If you want to go with the odds, it was a fucking Muslim extremist trying to take out  as many people in New York City as he could.  Uh, and that's the one you, you go with, you know, they're, they're checking on terrorism. 
[00:27:00]  You don't even speculate, uh, until you get some, some accurate info.  They come around with it pretty quickly these days, but he was speculating that it was some  right wing lunatic that didn't like Obama's policies.  Really?  Really?  Dummy?  Uh, just go, just, just bug people with all your other shit.  I heard something this morning on the news and Bloomberg's name didn't come up, but,  uh, it sounded like something that was right up his alley.  They were talking about restaurants and how sometimes people sit at a table a long time 
[00:27:30]  at a restaurant.  Sure.  And, uh, uh, they, they were trying to figure out a way to free up more tables and have  some kind of time limit in restaurants where people can sit, uh, before they have to get  up and leave.  Right.  So that more people can go through the restaurants.  And I was just waiting to hear Bloomberg's name in there, uh, for, for some kind of law  where you would have to, you'd have to get up after a certain amount of time.  They'd put a parking meter next to the table. 
[00:28:00]  You get a muni meter where you got to fucking put money in and, and, and twist it and put  a ticket by your table for how long you're, you're able to sit there.  I think you're able to sit as long as you fucking want, as long as you take care of the, the  waitstaff.  Yeah.  Like if you're going to sit there through what the waitstaff could have gotten two people  on, you better tip that fucking person.  I agree.  You know, but there shouldn't be something that would get you, uh, kicked out of the  restaurant because you want to sit there with your espresso.  So my friend and I would like some coffee and cake. 
[00:28:30]  It is.  It's a weird thing because you don't want to be rushed when you're eating.  Like I don't want to be rushed, but it's also anyone who sits there for two hours babbling  during like rush hour at lunch is an asshole.  Yeah.  There's, there's a, you make it up yourself.  You let the establishment do their own shit and they do.  They send over people to go, uh, anything else for you?  They bring the check.  If you're sitting there too long, I've seen that happen.  Uh, can we get anything else for you? 
[00:29:00]  Here's the check.  You know, that means get the fuck out, but they can't, there's no way to get people out.  They're going to have to, this is one of those things.  You know how like when occasionally during drug deals, when they lose, uh, when they drop  cocaine, they lose a bag of cocaine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have people sit there for too long, shut the fuck up and deal with it.  I know it's annoying, but what are you going to do?  Legislate it?  It doesn't happen a lot.  I'm sure.  But yeah, that's something that should never, ever be legislated or have the, uh, the dopey 
[00:29:30]  fucking government get their mitts in.  Uh, oh, well, you broke the law.  Here's a fucking ticket for sitting at a table too long.  I don't know how far they want to go with that, but it just seemed ridiculous to me.  But he's very comfortable, again, making laws and handing out tickets.  He's very comfortable.  Loves it.  Yeah.  Nudging more money out of your fucking pocket.  Yeah.  Whereas, uh, there, there are some, um...  I curse to sound smarter, by the way. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, it works.  More forceful.  It works.  I love cursing.  Uh, to make a point.  Fucking point.  They, they, they want to, he wants to put more, more cameras on, uh, corners.  Right.  Because of the red light cams and things like that.  It made a fuckload of money.  The limited ones they do have out in here in New York.  And then, I read, uh, in Texas, they're just taking the fucking things down.  Because Texans and the Texas government decided, nah, you know what?  This ain't good.  We don't like this.  It doesn't work.  It's, it's, it's intrusive. 
[00:30:30]  It's not Texas.  Right.  And they, they had them, had them ripped out.  At least of one, uh, city.  And it's, uh, Houston.  Planet Houston.  And, uh, I think it's great.  It's fucking great.  I, I would, I would move to Texas if it wasn't so, uh, hot.  Texas.  No, if it wasn't so hot.  It just seems like a place I don't think I'd fit in as well as I think I would or want,  or would want to.  No.  You know?  I, I, I, maybe in the old days when I, I used to, you know, I came back from California, 
[00:31:00]  used to wear my cowboy hat and my boots.  Little Anthony the cowboy.  Riding horses.  Yeah.  If I would have stuck with that, I'd be a natural.  Yeah.  Uh, but now it just seems to me to be a little too, I love it.  I love Texans.  I love Texas.  I love the way they say, fuck you to the, uh, United States federal government.  It's wonderful.  But, uh, as, as a state to move to, I'm not sure.  It would probably have to be a gradual move.  I think you'd have to move somewhere. 
[00:31:30]  Somewhere first.  Start to get into the Texas mentality.  Yeah.  Then to Texas.  I can't, I don't think you could go from New York.  You need a stepping stone.  Because you're a New Yorker right now.  New Yorker.  Now I'm pretty much a New Yorker.  Yeah.  It's going to take a couple years to become a Texan.  You can't go from New York to Texas.  No, no, no, no.  They would love your views on guns and on conservative views and certain views you have on political  correctness.  Yeah, on taxes and things like that.  But let's be really frank here.  Yes.  You're a loud, obnoxious man.  A loud, obnoxious New Yorker.  Yes. 
[00:32:00]  They hate that.  There's no Southern charm about you whatsoever.  None whatsoever.  You're absolutely right.  I would have to kind of weed that out in my slow migration down to Texas.  Right.  Maybe stopping at, uh, maybe Tennessee.  Yeah.  How about Tennessee?  Nashville, yeah.  I stopped down at Tennessee.  I don't think your driving style would mesh well in Texas.  Are they very relaxed?  Well, I think things go a little slower in Texas.  Right.  Slow, yeah.  In the South, you're talking about an area where-  I get a pickup.  You still, you see somebody on the street and you might nod and say good morning. 
[00:32:30]  Even if it's a stranger.  That's not, that's not the place you're in.  I see that as somebody trying to rob me.  Right.  You have your hand on your gun.  I would absolutely be ready to draw on that person.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why it has to be gradual.  Maybe like you go from here to somewhere Midwest, then someplace more Southern.  Then Texas.  You don't want to move so much, though.  Well, I mean, if you want to become a Texan.  Yeah.  That's what it's going to take.  I think you'd be too extreme even for Texas. 
[00:33:00]  They'd be like, look, we like guns.  We like guns a lot down here.  You can't walk around with a .50 cal in your pocket.  It looks weird.  Too big.  A little leg rig.  Yeah, it's way down there like Han Solo's blaster on my leg.  Yeah, I could stop off at, I guess, Pennsylvania's probably first, right?  Just to slow down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Immediate decompression, Pennsylvania.  Then I'd have to go to Kentucky.  Kentucky's a good place to start. 
[00:33:30]  I was just thinking that.  And then...  Kentucky's not that friendly.  Yeah.  Would I need to then stop somewhere in between, or can I go right from Kentucky to Texas?  Maybe like a Little Rock.  No, I'm not moving to Arkansas.  You don't want to move to Arkansas?  No, I know about Little Rock.  That place is full of them.  I think you should take your...  But you also be careful, too.  You gotta watch me move in Texas because there's some fucking El Paso.  Yeah.  There's some fucking...  Right over that Mexican border, man, there is some gang violence.  Oh, well, I wouldn't live near the border, near the Mexican border. 
[00:34:00]  That's fucking a given.  You'd be a Dallas guy.  I wouldn't live in East Texas because it's too close to Louisiana, and they've had some people  that have been displaced, that maybe, you know...  I'd probably like to live closer to the New Mexican border, perhaps.  Ah.  Somewhere nice...  I don't know.  How's the panhandle?  How's the panhandle?  Where's the Texas panhandle? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, it's there.  That's that big square little thingy sticking them out of the top.  We don't know.  There's Texans laughing at us.  I like the Florida panhandle.  So maybe like Amarillo?  Amarillo.  Amarillo?  Amarillo, Texas.  Dallas, dude.  You gotta go to a city.  You can't be so isolated.  You can afford a really great place, but they have oil money in Texas, too, so...  But how about like in the suburbs of Dallas?  Yeah.  Where like the show Dallas, they had like cool places outside of Dallas, but it's close  enough where if I want to go to the city, I could go into Dallas.  Go to a cowboy game. 
[00:35:00]  It's in...  Oh.  It's in...  What is it?  It's where the improv is.  Dallas.  Not Fort Worth.  Fort Worth is right there.  Addison, Texas.  Addison?  Yeah, but I think you want like a city that's more Texas, Texas.  Not like where people go, like Lubbock.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We got Abel online, too.  Abel is from Dallas.  Oh, I'm sorry about your brother.  Hey, Abel.  I'm actually out of Dallas, man.  I'm actually out of...  I'm running around Murphy area.  And where is that as far as Dallas? 
[00:35:30]  Right there where that Dallas...  You know, the TV show filmed at Parker, right around Parker, Texas.  Right.  Parker.  Right over...  Yeah, right around that area over there.  Yeah, is that nice?  Yeah, it's pretty nice, man.  You can get some...  You know, from what you're paying over there, jeez.  Are you originally from Texas, or did you move there from somewhere else?  Yeah, I'm originally from Texas.  See?  Wow, you don't really sound like you don't have a big Texan drawl.  Oh, man, it's not like that around here anymore, though. 
[00:36:00]  No?  I mean, like Houston, Houston.  I mean, there's still, you know, guys that still farm and stuff out here, but, you know,  that's up north.  Crazy.  Out east, west, and stuff like that, where it's still a bunch of...  Out west, it's still...  It's too damn hot, man.  You get a lot of damn...  I think Houston has a lot of good comedians that come out of it, too.  It reminds me of, like, the Boston in the south.  Yeah, but that's when everyone went...  Everyone from Katrina went to Houston.  No, no, I know.  I'm just saying, they had some really cool comedy scene down there.  Oh, my God.  That house is...  Oh, my God! 
[00:36:30]  They're using guns, though.  That house...  I'm looking at a house here, sir.  Hold on.  What's the lot?  It's 1998, too.  I don't know what the whole lot is.  6,454 square feet.  It's a seven-bedroom, eight-bathroom.  Oh, that's wonderful.  $3 million.  Wow.  But you know what you get for $3 million here?  Yeah.  On how much property that is.  It's probably a lot.  Let's see.  Jesus Christ.  You want to go with 10...  At least 10 acres so you can shoot your guns out there. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I need 10 acres.  At least.  At least.  You know, he moved out here for a reason.  I want, like, 100 acres, though.  I want fucking tripwires.  Claymores.  100 acres.  You put some cattle out there, you can rot it off.  Some cattle.  Oh, as a farm.  Oh, man.  This is sounding good.  Could you own a horse in Texas if you wanted to?  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't mind a horse.  I think it's the law.  You can own a horse in New Jersey.  That was another innocent, cute Jimmy question. 
[00:37:30]  Can you own a horsey in Texas?  I want a horsey.  And Jim wants to buy a horse so he can pet it.  I would love to.  You can have a horse in any state in the Union, I believe.  I would never clean the gunk out of its cock.  I want to get a horse in Manhattan just to offend all my neighbors.  And at night, they would just hear me beating it to sit.  It would be all sad.  Oh, he's just sad.  Poor thing.  All right.  Abel, thank you.  I actually have a couple of calls now that might be pertinent to the show. 
[00:38:00]  It's amazing.  Line three, Ed from Texas.  Hey, my good Texan friend, Ed, what's up?  Hey, you need to move to East Texas.  East Texas.  We've got hills, we've got trees.  Yeah.  I'm 70 miles from Dallas, so I don't have to deal with the bullshit.  What about the shit from, like, Arkansas and Louisiana that comes over the border there?  You know what I mean?  Louisiana, that's South Texas.  That's Southeast Texas.  Okay, all right.  Hey, look, we've got to have some fun.  That's why we live close to Arkansas, so we can point and tease them, folks. 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  I like pointing and teasing.  Thank you, Ed.  Thank you, Ed.  He's the East Texas guy.  Let me see what else would be good there.  I like that people do, the speed limit is very high.  Yeah.  That's good.  And can, oh, all right, Rick, Rick from Texas.  Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Rick, what's up, man?  What's up?  Yeah, 80 miles an hour out there between El Paso and San Antonio. 
[00:39:00]  You can do 90, you don't really even fuck with you.  You can carry a loaded Barrett .50 caliber in your back seat and a loaded Desert Eagle in  your fucking front seat underneath the seat.  This just sounds like paradise to me.  It's paradise.  Wow.  I live in El Paso.  I carry a P226 .357 SIG in my truck, and I also have an AR-10 .308 that I carry in my  truck, so, yeah.  A pickup truck. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would need to buy a pickup, right?  Well, you know, a nice F-250 four-wheel drive, you know?  Yeah.  With the windows and big tires on it and fucking side-to-side exhausts, you'll have fun.  Yeah, yeah.  I could be badass down there, because I would just buy the fucking, like, white trash shit  and be, like, fucking 10 feet off the ground with a giant truck, all guns all over it.  You'll blend.  You'll love it down there, you know?  Nobody wants to, nobody's fun with you out there. 
[00:40:00]  That sounds good, man.  At all.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Yeah, that sounds good.  How many acres are you looking for?  I'm looking for, like, 100.  Oh, okay.  This is 348 acres.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Let me see.  And how much is that going for?  1.9.  Billion?  No.  348 acres?  2 million dollars?  348 acres.  You get 348 acres.  20-acre fully-stocked lake.  A 20-acre lake?  Fully-stocked is what?  Like Jack Danielson?  Yeah.  They probably put a bunch of fish in there. 
[00:40:30]  That'd be fucking...  Yeah.  Fully-stocked.  You'd get a paddle boat.  I want a paddle boat.  How big's a 20-acre lake?  Fruit.  20 acres.  Big enough for a paddle boat?  20 acres.  That's a big fucking lake.  You gotta be careful you don't swim, though, and get that fucking algae in you that eats  your brain.  Ah, you've been hearing about that?  Yes, I have.  A couple of people have died from that.  And this is the house...  There's a house on it, too?  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  I thought...  I swear I thought you just meant the land.  No.  Like 100 acres costs you about 1.9 mil. 
[00:41:00]  No, no.  What would you do with 350 acres?  I'd be scared to have that much.  Shoot!  I would run around naked, yelling, screaming, and shooting my guns in the air.  Would you have security cameras all over the place and the trees and everything?  I'd put in fake trees with security camera eyeballs in them.  Oh, I'd hire people just to walk the perimeter.  Like dress the trees like the Wizard of Oz?  Yes.  You'd have guards?  Just dress like trees.  I'd have guards walking around.  Snipers in the trees?  Oh, it'll be wonderful until, you know, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms comes wheeling up because  it's considered now a real compound.  You know what? 
[00:41:30]  You could do...  Let's just say that things don't work out here, and you could transport your studio.  You could actually do a show from there.  Oh, I absolutely could do a show from anywhere.  Imagine that much land.  There's a 20 by 50 metal building outside that houses more guests and a game room.  You can just put your studio right there.  A metal building?  How unpleasant is that?  Big shack?  You'd have to do the inside so it doesn't look metal.  What's the metal building look like? 
[00:42:00]  I bet when it hails, it's very loud there.  When they get those hailing tornadoes.  That's something else I gotta worry about.  That's probably it.  Tornado.  Who needs a building that just constantly is interfering?  No, it's metal.  Oh.  It's different.  Okay, this is the inside.  Oh, look at that.  Ping pong table.  Ping pong table.  That fucking stinks.  I'm telling you, they're making it look a lot nicer than it is.  They really are.  A big rug and a ping pong table in that shitty lake.  There's your lake.  There's that shitty lake.  Well, there's no paddle boat on it yet. 
[00:42:30]  It looks awful.  You know what would be fun to do in that lake, though?  Maybe a little jet skiing.  Yeah?  You couldn't go that far.  You can do whatever you want.  It's your lake.  It's my fucking lake.  How much freedom do you have, though?  Is it really yours?  Look at that.  That thing looks like a mud hole.  That is the dirtiest lake I've ever seen.  I'd be walking around happy for a day going, yeah, look what I own.  And then I'd be like, what am I going to do with this?  Look, that's your front door.  That's like, it looks like the OK Corral.  Yeah.  Post and rail fence.  Well, this is called Rock Falls Ranch.  Rock Falls Ranch.  But you could rename it, I'll bet. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, I would.  Yeah.  I would.  Sir, we don't have two Gs immediately to put on the sign.  Now, let me ask you, what year is this built?  What does Arbeit mean?  What does that mean?  Arbeit.  It's German.  May have been a sign over a horrible place.  I know what sign you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  You have to, if you move to Texas, try to fit in. 
[00:43:30]  And wear Marty McFly's pink cowboy shirt that he wore in Back to the Future 3.  Oh, yeah, I call myself Clint Eastwood.  Yeah, that would be good.  What kind of a name is that?  I don't think I'd fit.  See, this is, I don't think I'd fit in very well.  It's a gradual process.  You can't just move from, you know, your house in Long Island to a ranch in Texas.  You like being near the city, dude.  You're not that isolated.  I like being in a house, a nice house, but I like being near the city.  And by the city, I mean the city. 
[00:44:00]  New York.  Yeah.  What am I going to do?  The furthest I think I'd move is probably Pennsylvania.  It's cheap.  Exactly.  We would go to Pittsburgh, look at the mountains.  No, but close enough where I could still get to Manhattan, where it's not that big a pain in the ass.  But if you get deep into Pennsylvania, you might as well be in the south.  I mean, once everything kind of becomes the south.  Upstate New York kind of becomes the south.  Yeah.  But you know what?  Deep into Pennsylvania becomes the south.  For how cheap everything is, I'd be able to get a helicopter and just helicopter my ass into Manhattan. 
[00:44:30]  At least you're being practical.  Yeah.  Because that's what you want to do for an extra three acres helicopter to the city.  Fuck, so you don't have to eat at a fucking Ruby Tuesdays.  Some shitty fucking, you know, witness protection town.  But yeah, I don't know.  People say the Ponderosa.  Yeah, it would be kind of like a ranch type thing.  And I don't want a ranch.  I want a compound.  The way they sell these fucking ranches, Anthony, is the way New York hotels advertise. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  They always show you.  I was talking to a friend of mine.  And she was saying like, yeah, this hotel in Midtown.  And she was saying, I'd never heard of it.  And she was saying it's like 150 bucks.  And I'm like, that's not a good place.  That's not a good hotel in Manhattan for 150 bucks.  No.  No, no, no, no.  No.  Oh, what's this?  What did you see there?  Well, I'm just looking at United Country Bobo Realty.  It's United Country Bobo Realty.  That's where that ranch was.  Just buy a ranch.  You want to buy?  What do you want to buy? 
[00:45:30]  Could I come near there for the show?  Just interrupting everybody.  Oh, it's fucking worse.  I'm calling to buy a ranch.  Right?  Right?  Fuck you.  You tell them, you know, well, that's a little expensive.  Can we negotiate?  Fuck you.  That is buying right.  He's not going to buy it.  No, I need it, boy, because I need the commission for buying the meds tickets because I can't  go there.  I'm right, you whiny fuck.  You did I.  You did I.  Shut up, would you?  Fuck you. 
[00:46:00]  There he is.  For the show.  Oh, we might as well.  How are we doing with girls, by the way?  Not really good, Ant.  I know.  Oh, my goodness.  How are we?  I didn't mean we.  I mean, how are we doing with girls for the Bobo extravaganza date?  Last I checked, we have eight lovely women.  Do you have the plug in your email that we could just do it now?  Nope.  I would love to see some of the photographs of these women.  Maybe after we take a little break and eat, we will look at some of the girls. 
[00:46:30]  Bobo is reportedly.  We'll chop them down to size.  Very excited.  Like literally, like he gets.  Yeah.  You played on the shit hour, the hunk of steaming pile of moist, gooey shit hour.  You don't feel that way.  Which is from 10 to 11.  Well, I listen to it every day on the way home.  But it's the shit hour.  People forget that part.  I know.  I heard you reminding people yesterday. 
[00:47:00]  It's like, it's a shit hour.  And I'm listening, as you're saying, but Anthony listens.  But it was more like me trying to convince Mick Foley that you guys weren't being serious.  Please, Mick.  People do do this show.  It's a real show.  Don't go home.  Don't go home.  Yeah.  Do you know how many times I've gotten in the car on the way home and said to Kenny,  just turn this down for a minute?  And talked a little business.  And then I'm home and it hasn't been turned back up.  And it just never got turned back up.  I mean, business is business.  But I need something.  See, the thing is, I need something that angers me more than the traffic. 
[00:47:30]  And that's with the...  That's you and the show.  So I listen to it and I'm like, ah, fuck.  And then I don't really pay attention to how angry I'm getting at traffic.  Our purpose at the after show is to evoke emotions.  So whatever that is, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I did hear you saying that.  And now I got all off track because I was going to bring up a point about the Bobo.  No.  No, it's not there.  You forgot it?  It was about the contest.  It was your shit show. 
[00:48:00]  Bobo excited.  The contest.  Oh, that's right.  Thank you.  It was Patrice.  The replay of Patrice laughing his ass off at Bobo where his dick was going up and down  the up and down game.  Do you know I thought of that yesterday when Bill was in?  That's hilarious.  There's a video of that, of Patrice.  Yeah.  And it starts a little late because fucking Ope is OCD and he keeps all of his stuff stored  on the camera.  And he has like a quarter of a gig left.  Like, he literally won't.  It's like, get rid of it.  You have...  And he'll just start filming at a critical moment.  And then run out of space. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  As a gun is fired, he picks up his camera and he films.  It's like, dude, just let him run.  But anyway, he's got a bigger camera now.  But that was...  It starts.  Yeah.  Here it goes.  Yeah.  Patrice.  Patrice's laugh.  And stick's getting hard.  Healer.  Yeah, but you know what I might do to get her the next time I have to trust my team?  I might get her one of those...  You can take me to that thing.  You can say she can't come back.  We have to get her.  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He literally had to walk out of the studio. 
[00:49:30]  I get your point.  I don't know the whole time.  And then Bobo's just babbling over it.  That's like fading away.  Nah, you can bring it back down again.  Patrice literally had to leave the studio.  He couldn't breathe.  He collapsed off his seat.  He fell off his seat.  I've had a few laughs like that with him.  It's very rare you see him laugh that uncontrollably.  I've laughed like that maybe a few times.  I probably have.  We've talked about this.  I've had a few of the biggest laughs of my life with Patrice. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like that.  Yeah, hilarious.  One of them was we were laughing at this guy, Wills,  because he had deformed feet, a comedian.  And he had his feet had horrible bunions.  And he walked into the room.  And me and Patrice lived with him.  And we made eye contact.  And we just looked at Will's feet.  And we both understood that we have to attack him.  And that was one of those moments where you can't breathe from laughing.  It's rare you have them.  People say it all the time. 
[00:50:30]  But you don't have them very often.  Well, why wasn't he wearing something on his feet?  Why would he?  Because he lived there.  He had socks off.  And he tried to laugh it off.  But the laugh was like that.  But it continued for a lot longer than that.  And it was both of us.  And Will just couldn't leave the room.  He had to just stand there and smile through it.  He actually had surgery on his feet to fix it.  Oh, he did?  We scarred him for that, yeah.  Wow.  That's one of my favorite moments on the show, though, is Patrice enjoying Bobo.  You forced him into surgery.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, that's one of my favorite.  That, and we were talking about the fucking face-off. 
[00:51:00]  And I was convincing him that it was a bad movie.  But it's so funny because at one point he's laughing.  He goes, oh, my.  Oh, God, Norton, I'm sorry.  And he apologized for liking face-off.  It was really a funny moment.  He apologized.  As if he had been caught really offending me.  Yes.  So should we break?  Yeah, let's take a break.  He will eat and come back to more fun festivities. 
[00:51:30]  And I guess Rich Voss and Robert Kelly.  We're going to tug our kettlebells.  Let's tug our kettlebells right after these were.  Fuck yeah!  Sirius XM, the virus.  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America  and south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right, man.  Where are we going?  All right.  I'll tell you where we're going to go to funny land.  He's back with an all-new CD, Where Are We Going?  What a termite seat for breakfast. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, what, Billy?  Oak meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the look-alike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  Fuck the...  Oh, hey.  I hate the fucking...  Just like you do.  Where are we going?  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right, what's Mary short for?  She's got no legs. 
[00:52:30]  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman and his all-new CD,  Where Are We Going?  Available now at truck stops and cracker barrels everywhere.  And now 34 seconds with former politician, talk show host,  and solicitor of prostitution, Jerry Springer.  Let me tell you something.  Okay, here you go.  Well, I mean, I won't be...  I won't...  Oh, it...  Yeah, he's...  No, it's just...  Well, what is...  You know, you... 
[00:53:00]  I mean, you know...  Um...  No...  In the...  Uh...  Um...  Okay.  Well...  Well...  I mean, it's...  Oh...  Yeah...  We...  Um...  Yeah...  Yeah...  We...  We...  Well...  Yeah...  Well...  The...  Um...  Okay...  Uh...  Where...  Where did that come from?  That's...  That's unbelievable.  That was 34 Seconds with talk show host, Jerry Springer. 
[00:53:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, what the hell was that?  It's just skipped.  Look at you.  He rocks making digital music, Skip.  Poor kid.  Come on.  It's fucking, like, late.  I only took an hour and ten. 
[00:54:00]  I know.  That was, like, record time.  Just trying to fumble and blunder.  Let him fumble and blunder.  I have fucking windows, man.  Windows.  Yeah, me too.  I just like to have a nice dark bedroom.  Crashed on me.  Yeah.  Speaking of computers, by the way...  Fucking...  Bill Gates woke up this morning with a nice fat heart on.  Jesus.  Yeah, uh...  Well...  Apple computer.  Um...  Taking a little bit of a nosedive.  Because Steve Jobs put in his letter of resignation. 
[00:54:30]  Yes.  Who did he send it to himself?  You know what?  That isn't as dumb as it sounds from Rich.  Wait a minute.  Who does he send it?  Yeah, uh...  He gave up.  He just said, uh, fuck it.  I'm leaving.  I guess...  I guess he either wants to live a little bit of his life without having to deal with the whole Apple thing.  Um, or...  Uh, it's probably best for the company that he doesn't drop dead during a keynote address. 
[00:55:00]  So, yeah.  He'll retire.  And, uh...  I don't give him much time, though.  I don't know, because I was wondering before, Anthony, I was speculating, as two friends will do.  Yeah.  Is he gonna die really soon?  Or he cares about Apple a lot more than most CEOs do.  Yeah.  And he may know that it's gonna take a little hit, so he'll be around for a while on the board, or the chairman of the board.  People will still have Steve Jobs at Apple.  He's just...  He's...  I think he's just putting the day-to-day fucking pressure duties aside. 
[00:55:30]  So it's almost like he'll still be there, so confidence will still be there for the company.  I think he has to get to Martha's Vineyard.  Martha's Vineyard for what?  Nothing.  I just kept hearing it on the radio.  I'm tired of hearing it.  Tired of hearing it.  Oh, why?  Because the president's there?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm tired of hearing it.  Who cares?  I'm tired of hearing it.  Who cares?  Who cares?  I don't know what that meant.  At the end of the day, I was leaning into something.  You know, he has pancreatic cancer, which is...  Pancreatic.  Which is one of the worst. 
[00:56:00]  One of the worst.  One of the worst.  That's what our own Patrick Swayze died of.  All right.  That's what Bill Hicks died of.  A banana, my Patrick Swayze.  That's what Bill Hicks died of, yeah.  Bill Hicks.  I thought he had lung cancer.  No.  Pancreatic?  Yeah.  Sure.  Yes, I was...  Oh, okay.  And they...  That's a rough one.  But maybe you're right.  Ant said, all that money and you can't fucking fix it, man.  You can't fix it.  But I'm thinking, like, the average Joe, he'd have been dead already.  Maybe, yeah.  Like, I think he's getting the absolute best care he can get, and he's still dwindling 
[00:56:30]  away to nothing.  How much does he...  How old...  I'm sorry.  How old is he?  He's 22 years old.  He looks awful.  He really looks bad.  It really is.  He's done a lot, though.  That's just progeria.  Horrible.  Progeria.  Born in 1955?  Was he 56 years older than me?  No.  56 years old.  Wait, 50...  He's only 56?  Yeah.  That's what pancreatic cancer will do, as Rich says.  No, I don't mean his fucking...  He looks bad. 
[00:57:00]  I'm saying that, like, the years he had left with Steve Jobs' money.  Oh, my God.  I know, right?  God, he had another 30 years left.  That's fucking awful.  You should go see Magic Johnson's doctor.  I know, right?  I don't think that would help.  I politely avoided the fact that it was a bomb, and I just agreed...  It wasn't a bomb.  It just, you know...  Shut up.  You didn't mean it seriously.  Yeah, I did.  I'm very...  Look how I'm sitting.  I'm sitting serious.  You mean it.  Didn't Paul Ingalls die of that, too?  I don't know.  According to Dice, he was...  Asshole cancer. 
[00:57:30]  And that's what Dice would refer to him as on stage when he talked about Michael Landon.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, so I'm on the prairie with asshole cancer.  Asshole cancer.  That bit would never do well.  Me and Florentine would howl.  Asshole cancer.  Oh, that is his bit.  There's no one ever sounded dumber than Dice talking about Little House.  Yeah.  Oh, what kind of cleaning up the mule shit, and then asshole cancer comes in.  It was so fucking vicious.  Comes in and tells the girls, we don't have the money for that. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  And then she goes blind or something.  It really was just nonsense.  Of course it is.  It's Dice.  So I literally just bought Apple stock fucking 10 days ago.  Yeah, nice.  Good.  Good.  I mean, oh.  Making it about me.  Oh.  You know what?  I think in your short term, you're going to see a little dive happen.  Sure.  But it's a great company.  What the fuck are you going to do?  It's not one guy. 
[00:58:30]  It's not just that one guy.  He didn't make the whole company, Steve Jobs.  Second biggest company in the world.  Yeah?  What's the first there, Rich?  Exxon.  Exxon.  I don't think they're the second biggest in the world.  They've grown really fast.  I don't think they're the second biggest.  Go look at, what are you kidding me?  Are they really?  Look up biggest companies in the world.  They're bigger than Windows and Microsoft?  Yeah.  They took over Exxon as the most profitable company.  They're bigger than U.S. Steel.  Profitable.  Put a liver on my table, I'll know we have a deal.  God damn Apple.  I guess I'm incorrect. 
[00:59:00]  Most valuable public company.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Apple.  They're not bigger than GE, are they?  Yes, the most valuable public company would include companies that were overtaken by the government  because they couldn't make any more money.  That might be it.  That might be it.  But Steve Jobs also, the biggest single shareholder in Disney, we found out.  And that's from his Pixar days. 
[00:59:30]  When he was just, you know, fucking around, he came up with, you know, Pixar.  And no one even thinks about that part of it.  So he's got some Pixar money.  He only drew a $1 a year salary from Apple.  What movie was Pixar?  See the thing?  What movie was Pixar?  Yeah.  That was...  A dollar a year he took from Apple?  I mean, that just shows how stupid he is.  It's like, dude, you could have made more.  Watch him only be worth $1,800. 
[01:00:00]  And he just banked away that buck.  Maybe that's why he resigned.  Yeah.  He couldn't afford to be the Apple.  Someone broke.  Salary sucks.  Realizing he's an idiot.  Every Wednesday he had to go into the board and ask for money, a raise, and they would say,  no.  Oh, wait.  No.  That's you.  See?  Get it?  I had to be back.  Wap, wap, wap, wap, wap.  How would he make his money?  Just from shares?  Yeah.  He makes all of his money from Disney and Pixar.  He owns more shares of Disney than any single person. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  He's actually got Walt's frozen head right there in his apartment.  Thank you.  Well, if he had head cancer, then that would help.  That would help.  Just screw Walt's head onto there and walk around yelling anti-Semitic shit.  Oh, that Walt hated the Jews.  Oh, boy, did he?  Oh, gosh.  How bad?  I mean, I know he did, but how bad?  And what examples do you have?  Well, I think, yeah.  I'd like to hear some.  How bad of an anti-Semitic.  That's how poor Jews have to think.  How much did he hate us?  How much did he hate us? 
[01:01:00]  No, because Nixon was anti-Semitic, but he wasn't, like, full-blown.  You know, he had Kissinger as Secretary of State.  Well, Pirates of the Caribbean was originally moneylenders of Israel.  And you would sail through, and Jews would try to take your money.  It was a very fun ride, but that had to go.  Chitty, shitty Jew steel.  And people just, people didn't go for that at all.  It's a small world run by the Jews after all.  It's a big nose.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Just terrible.  The Matterhorn Jew nose. 
[01:01:30]  There's a coaster that went through the nostril.  He was very anti-Semitic.  Quit some other Disney products.  It was very, very anti-Semitic.  I don't know if originally...  Take care of Belstein.  Do you know originally they were Mickey and Minnie?  Yeah, he was not very...  He didn't like the Jews very much.  Neither Henry Ford.  Really?  Or Hitler.  Well, Hitler comes off as the... 
[01:02:00]  He was more overt about it, wasn't he?  He really wore it on his sleeve as he gave his little salute.  You saw it.  You know, sometimes you want to ask him, what did he really feel?  I mean, you know, just...  Hitler himself, like, what are you thinking?  He's like, I don't like Jews.  That's what he was thinking the whole time.  Why don't you just sit down and take a look?  Maybe you're not a good artist.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  If he would have talked up his paintings a little more,  perhaps give him that boost of confidence, 
[01:02:30]  maybe that wouldn't have happened.  Saul Saperstein should have given him better reviews  in the fucking...  In the Nazi paint review.  But isn't that weird?  Like, how many lives would have been saved  if his art was really well received  and he just became this flamboyant artist?  I mean, it's fucking...  That shows you.  If you think there's a God...  Boy, God really allowed all these fucking families  to be murdered  because this cocksucker couldn't fucking paint an apple better?  That's free will.  Manson, Charles Manson,  he just wanted to be a rock star. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  And when his music didn't take off,  he decided his music started culting...  It was terrible.  Terrible music, though.  You know what?  I don't know who penciled that whole free will thing in,  but it really takes God off the hook.  Yeah.  In a lot of circumstances.  You're like,  if there's a God,  why did this guy do this?  It's like,  hey, free will, motherfucker!  God is so cool  that he gave us all this shit.  He could perform all these miracles and stuff like that.  But he also gave us free will to do whatever we want. 
[01:03:30]  It's like,  well, maybe we don't want that shit.  Yeah.  Maybe you want a bad guy  that's going to fucking kill a bunch of people  for God to be able to go,  nope,  not going to allow that.  Free will,  fuck you.  But how many times you don't know  because God maybe  has stopped  hundreds of those people,  but one every now and then  squeezes through the cracks.  That is one slip through.  It's God.  That's not him.  It's like playing ping pong against the retard.  It ain't getting through.  One slips through.  He killed six million people. 
[01:04:00]  Now he'll squeeze through at the same time.  That's a big crack.  That's one of God's little,  oops,  it slipped through.  You can't say,  because of the bad things,  all the good things that happened,  you don't go,  that was God.  When bad things have you go,  oh,  there's no God.  You know?  Yeah.  You can't,  you can't,  you know,  you can't be focused.  It's drivel,  Rich.  And I hate to say that,  it's drivel.  Yeah,  you could just look at it as,  you don't believe in a God?  In a God?  You don't believe in it?  It's almost impossible.  Because look at your career.  You must believe in a God.  Sorry.  If there was a God, 
[01:04:30]  there would be a fucking windscreen  in between you and I and saliva.  Well,  Bobby will be here.  I go back and forth.  I want to believe,  but I find it.  I didn't talk about sex.  I find it,  I find it hard.  Yeah.  I find it almost impossible now.  I think,  I think when,  when people talk about God  and they say,  I don't believe in God,  but I believe in some deity  that made this all,  everything that surrounds us.  I don't even believe in that.  I think it's just something,  just some coincidence  of fucking chemicals 
[01:05:00]  and bullshit  that got together  and that's the only reason  we're here.  And I think once you fucking die,  you're done.  It's just blackness  and nothingness forever.  I don't know about that.  Do you believe in the devil?  No.  Because how many,  how many,  do you really think  he's going to say yes?  No,  wait a second.  I believe in the devil.  I'm talking to him too.  How many,  how many,  I'm a Christian.  How many instances  and proofs  of people being possessed  and all that crap?  There's been no instance 
[01:05:30]  of proof of possession.  You didn't see The Exorcist?  I saw it.  That was a movie, Rich.  Based on another movie.  I have seen videos,  I've heard audio tapes  of exorcisms  where the girl is possessed  and she's speaking in tongues.  It's just gibberish.  It's fucking,  it could be someone  who's just fucking insane  has a chemical imbalance  and you get these priests  that,  oh,  it's the devil is possessing. 
[01:06:00]  No,  they're not.  Why don't you believe,  there's a devil.  Why don't you believe in Zeus?  Like the way I look at it  is we look at Greek mythology  and we look at it like,  oh,  it's a fun read in school  but it's nonsense.  So why all of a sudden  do we think that Christ  is a,  it's just,  I don't want to feel that way.  I really don't.  I don't think religious people  are all assholes  but I just can't see it anymore.  I think when you put  too much detail  to religion,  it falls apart.  Like the whole  Greek mythology,  you have to believe  that there is  some guy living in the clouds  with lightning bolts 
[01:06:30]  and he throws them down.  We'll see this weekend.  And then you realize,  no,  and science comes up  with the answer  as to why we have lightning  and stuff  and it's not a guy  that's sitting in the clouds.  So when it becomes  that silly,  you need a very vague religion  for people to  have to have faith in it.  And I think,  I think the Catholic religion  is like that,  especially the one  that we live in today  where a lot of the original  laws and rules of God 
[01:07:00]  that would have gotten you killed,  the Spanish Inquisition,  things like that,  have gone to the wayside  and now it's just,  well,  if you're good  and you go to church  and you'll go to heaven.  That's pretty fucking vague.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It's hard to dispel  with science,  but then when people  get more involved  and go,  there were dinosaurs  5,000 years ago,  then their story  falls apart.  You've got to keep it  real fucking vague.  That's why they annoy me.  Religious people  have actually forced me 
[01:07:30]  away from religion  by their counter-arguments  are so nonsensical  and childish  and fucking,  they go in the face  of everything  that common sense.  It's like,  I want to believe  and I still can't buy  that dinosaurs  are running around  5,000 years ago,  you asshole.  Smoking parliaments.  That's just...  But here's the thing,  if you're putting  your stock  in these religious people,  if you believe  or disbelieve,  you can't prove  there is,  you can't... 
[01:08:00]  But they're trying...  Disprove there isn't.  Every bit of...  You know,  what?  Every bit of common sense  I have...  Yes.  Just unfortunately goes...  It's common sense,  but it's not supposed  to be figured out.  It's not supposed to be.  Here it is.  There's no answer.  It's not supposed  to be figured out.  Because it's faith-based,  there's no proof.  And there's not supposed  to be proof.  That's why it's called faith.  But what they're trying  to do now,  what they've done recently,  because science  has dispelled  so much of religion, 
[01:08:30]  that now religion  is trying to get  into the area of science  where they say,  all right,  you came up  with these dinosaur bones.  You've carbon tested  these things  and realized  that they are  millions of years old.  That predates  what our religion says  where the earth  first existed.  Now we have to say  that yes,  there was dinosaurs  because science  has proven it,  but they were around  5,000 years ago.  Ridiculous.  Okay,  but why do you have  to equate...  Speaking of dinosaurs, 
[01:09:00]  it becomes a Brontosaurus.  Bronto Kelly  is in the...  Why do you have to...  Did you hear me  running down the hallway?  Of course we did.  Without you.  You're walking  down the street.  Why do you...  Why do you...  At least they made you funny.  Shut up.  I think it's the biggest company.  Maybe it is.  Shut up.  He's doing pre...  He's doing pre-interviews.  Look at how  whipped up Vos gets  when I come in.  You fucking boring...  Why do you got to equate 
[01:09:30]  God with religion?  That's what religion  has taken...  It could just be a God  that says,  you know what,  I have nothing to do with religion.  Why do I equate God  with religion?  Some reason I equate you  with idiocy.  You don't understand  what I'm saying.  I understand what you're saying.  You have...  Because...  Because just believing  in a God  is a type of religion.  It's...  Hang on one second.  Can you give me  the granola?  I want to make Vos  feel more comfortable.  I want to eat it  out of my hand.  Fucking zoo creature. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, hold your hand.  Like you dig  your meatloaf.  Let us see.  Ah, yeah.  Ah, shit.  Oh, shit.  You can't come up  against Vos  with food jokes.  That's true.  That's because  he's working  restaurants all the time.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Jesus Christ.  The only Jew  can't make it  in show business.  Why are you attacking?  Why are you 
[01:10:30]  coming and attacking?  Why are you  coming and attacking?  How about you wipe  the fucking granola  off your lip, Rich?  Please.  It's hard to defend you.  Look like Lemmy.  He's just got  his fingers on his face.  You know that he writes his name on the front when you come in where it says you're supposed to write your name?  He just writes Voss like people know who he is.  Obviously you did.  Yeah, and I actually wrote stinks after your name.  No joke.  Go look.  That's because he was signing in. 
[01:11:00]  Please wipe your lip, Rich.  You have granola on your lip.  I can't look at it.  On your lip.  That's good.  I just wanted to address what you were saying.  If you believe in a God, that is believing.  It's faith-based, and that instantly makes it some type of religious belief.  If you have faith, your team's going to win.  Does that make you religious?  No.  If you have faith, you have faith that Chris Hansen's not going to walk in on you when you're going to leave. 
[01:11:30]  Well, I don't.  But here's what I'm saying.  You don't have to equate God with religion.  But you do.  Maybe not a religion that's popular and out, but the second you believe in a higher entity, a deity that made all this, you're delving into a new religion.  Or you're dealing into faith, and faith doesn't have to be religion.  But it does.  Where do you go from there?  What did he say?  Dealing into.  Dealing.  Dealing.  Dealing.  Delving in. 
[01:12:00]  Dealing.  Dealing.  Double town.  Yes, of course.  But where does it go from that?  Okay.  You have faith.  You have faith that there is an almighty something or other.  Where does it go from that that keeps it from not being a religion?  You have to then question what it is, where it came from, and how your life is involved and affected by this entity.  Listen, I would argue that you're too smart.  No, no.  I'm just trying to figure out what you thought. 
[01:12:30]  In the middle of that, Jimmy pulls his pants down and bare-ass farts right in Vaughn's face.  There's your God.  There's your burning bush.  There's your God.  See?  Look at your God now.  Oh, come on.  Let's ask Buddha his opinion.  Are you still two and a half days non-smoking?  Oh, very good, Bob.  We were talking about that when you were in here, and very good. 
[01:13:00]  I did it.  Woke up Tuesday.  Tuesday, coughing fit.  Oh, yeah.  I almost passed the fuck out.  Like, my lips went, you know, almost fucking just went out cold.  Coughing?  Yeah, I wake up.  The AC's on.  The fan's on.  I smoke like a pack and a half.  And I woke up in the morning.  I just couldn't breathe.  I cough and having to spit all that stuff up.  I have to cough so hard that I can't breathe.  You know what I mean?  So, I went upstairs.  I was like, dude, I'm fucking done. 
[01:13:30]  It also gets the blood pressure in your head up where you can't, where you're ready to faint, pass out.  That's what I was.  Just like, your face must turn.  Your face must turn so fucking red when you're coughing like that.  Yeah.  Because when you're vomiting in our studio, your face turns red your whole head.  You must look like Don Corleone grabbing a tomato plant every morning.  You should do the elliptical, though.  You should be sprayed with DDT by some child.  Do the elliptical. 
[01:14:00]  You're smelling it.  Fucking DDT.  You know, it was just DDT in there.  Something that made the kid fucking birth defect.  Yeah, but back then, they used to spray people down with that shit.  It didn't matter.  They used to go to a school and just have them come out and take their clothes off and hose them down with DDT.  Have a DDT snack.  Sure.  It's safe, Johnny.  I saw a video of that.  Just kids getting hosed down.  Hosed down with some kind of shit.  Yeah, guys in a hazmat suit, but the kids are just naked in their tighty weddies. 
[01:14:30]  It's okay.  Holding their little junks.  I'm sorry I'm chewing gum.  Yeah, it's all right.  If it's keeping you from smoking, where are you going to?  I just want to.  I just apologize to that fucking loser who's going to twit me later anyways.  Yeah.  Fucking stop chewing gum on the air.  Chewing gum is so real professional.  You're supposed to put it up in your lip.  I don't put the gum up in my lips.  You've been on it for five years, Rich.  How do you know?  You're addicted to it.  Obviously, you're right.  I know how it works.  No, you don't.  Yes.  You know how it works.  You can stick it up in your lip.  My teeth are real. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, okay.  Okay.  But I'm made out of old coffee cups like yours.  You couldn't have gotten that way from...  Listen to me.  No, fuck you.  Oh, no.  You bombed.  You fucking slippery-mouthed asshole.  We had the same shoes.  Then he just tried to make it in his...  Listen to me.  That's what I'm saying.  Well, I know what you're saying.  The gum, the nicotine...  Yes, sir.  You're going to fuck your stomach up.  Not that, you know, if you keep swallowing...  Another bomb. 
[01:15:30]  If you keep swallowing the nicotine...  Breathe.  I'm telling you the truth.  Where's your mustache go?  I don't trust you without a mustache.  I shave.  I keep it low now.  I keep it like the rough look.  Why?  What?  I don't like it.  I don't care.  I don't like it.  You can't get that spot underneath your nose.  The lip separator.  You know, it's not.  It's not a tough one.  Oh, isn't that ironic that he can't get rid of having a Hitler mustache?  Oh, I didn't even try.  I didn't even notice it.  I have a lot more bigger things on my mind.  I am.  Sorry about you.  And in your eyesight right now. 
[01:16:00]  You're looking at Bobby at the time.  That's why I don't want to be mean.  I don't want to go after Bobby.  You went after him the second he walked in.  Huh?  Because he snuck up on everybody.  How do I sneak up on anybody?  Why'd you just flinch?  I did flinch.  Yeah, you did.  You just went like that.  Are you all right after the fire?  You're not the same guy.  Oh, really?  What are the odds?  What are the odds?  We do have to hear about that, Rich.  The big fire at the condo.  Oh.  Really? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, because we haven't heard about it.  We haven't spoken to you about it.  Way more important things.  Before that, we talk about that.  I'm at Uncle Vinny's Friday night.  Oh, I got my plug sheet.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I think you're going to North Carolina.  You're going to block the storm.  And he's back.  He's back.  He's back.  I don't want to get on Bobby.  I want to be positive.  No, no.  It's HIV.  You don't like when Voss is positive?  I love positive Voss. 
[01:17:00]  For the fucking four and a half minutes that he is, every conversation, then he smashes  your mom.  I never say anything about your mom.  Yeah, you have.  I will.  Never in my life.  Never in my life.  Why not?  No, never once.  Go ahead.  Say something.  His mother's a nice lady, I'm sure, but her work is not very impressive.  Her mother, obviously, look what she pumped out.  There we go.  I'll leave that for the verse.  First of all, I thought you were adopted.  No, that's dumb DeRosa.  Oh, whatever.  He's the one who was left on the doorstep to Egypt. 
[01:17:30]  Fucking Arab dumb baby with big, round, goofy eyes.  Fucking black mark circles around him.  Poor Italian family in Philly that got a fucking crappy Arab baby instead of American baby.  Holy shit!  Go to the Upper West Side.  They would have took a redhead over that fucking dark circle douche.  Yes, Bob Kelly.  Tomorrow night, Uncle Vinny's Point Pleasant.  Right?  Point Pleasant Beach?  Is it tomorrow night? 
[01:18:00]  Yes, tomorrow night, Point Pleasant Beach.  Go to UncleVinny'sComedyClub.com.  I love putting in a bunch of letters when you're trying to fucking go to a website.  UncleVinny'sComedyClub.com.  I'm on Long Island.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Ooh, yes, Rich Voss.  Tomorrow night and Saturday at Governor's in Levittown.  That's right around the corner from me.  How far is that?  From me, it's probably a 10-minute ride, 10-minute drive.  Really?  Yeah.  I was telling them about how you can't comprehend why we go in the pool at Anthony's. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Why?  It's just so dumb.  Oh, I'm going to drive.  Maybe not for you because you live there.  Oh, thanks.  Because you live there.  But this fucking guy that is just so empty and he's trying to fill something, I'm going  to drive out to the island on a Friday night and go in a pool with a fucking guy I work  with every day.  Do you understand?  I've done it with him.  I've done it with him.  I know you did.  And it was fucking true.  It's one of the coolest things.  And then we go on the barbecue.  We get a bunch of fucking meat. 
[01:19:00]  We cook up shit on the barbecue.  And then we go in the jacuzzi.  Anthony and Jim try to kiss me.  He does that.  It's fun.  We try to make out with Bobby in the jacuzzi.  We had some laughs.  Do you have girls there?  No.  You have a girl.  He's a girl.  But I'd say all my friends.  I'd fucking...  She was passed out on the couch.  That's when I lift her up by the hair.  I went, you okay?  She went, ah.  Well, it's like four in the morning.  I look over at him.  He's just smile drunk.  Just smiling at everything in his shorts.  And his girl was just mumbling on his lap.  I go, dude, is she okay? 
[01:19:30]  He grabs her by the head, picks her up, looks at her, goes, she's fine.  And then drops it.  Let her head go.  It was on the couch.  It wasn't like she was on concrete.  You threw me a clip.  Through your magazine.  Here, check it out.  Play with bullets, fatso.  I can see hanging out.  I can see hanging out.  That's what we're doing.  A card game or something.  But let's go sit in a jacuzzi.  It's not just sit in a jacuzzi.  It's relaxing.  You laugh.  You talk.  You laugh.  You jump in the pool then.  So it's not just in the jacuzzi. 
[01:20:00]  It's all fucking big pools.  Fucking pools are overrated.  It's so stupid.  Why?  In the summer?  I don't want to pool.  No.  You Project Rat.  Pools are not overrated.  Overrated.  No, they're not.  We have a pool.  I had a pool.  No, you didn't have a pool.  You had a public fucking pool that the whole complex used.  No, no.  The town pool.  Oh, great.  The town pool.  That's great.  What is this?  The sandlot?  What the fuck?  A town pool.  Oh, don't try to stick up for your pool.  This is your pool.  It's a great pool. 
[01:20:30]  Pools are overrated.  Can I tell you something?  Probably pouring water out of a fucking...  All right.  Or his fucking penis pee water's coming out.  No, Jimmy actually does that live.  No, I have a nice little waterfall from the jacuzzi into the pool.  I had a good time when I came to the house for the barbecue in the day.  Yes.  That was nice.  He had some nice food and stuff.  Do you know...  I mean, I'll probably come by maybe tomorrow because I'm there, but I wouldn't go out of  my fucking way.  You know what I mean?  Like him.  You know...  Yeah, I'm glad you're going to throw us all a bone and stop by.  I go to see my friend. 
[01:21:00]  It's nice.  Just don't bring the crowd with the pitchforks and torches from governors.  I'm teasing, of course.  The crowd.  The crowd.  Voss.  Don't bring the two front tables of governors.  I happen to like going to see my friend.  It's one of the healthiest things I do.  Yeah, I'm not looking at...  I'm single now.  I'm not looking at porn or hookers.  I'm going to my friend's house and just hanging out and being normal.  It reminds him why he doesn't drink. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  It keeps him like, ah, that's why I don't drink.  His pool is like...  It's a bath.  It's cold on top.  No, it's warm on top and then it gets cold.  A little cooler at the bottom.  It's fun.  It's amazing.  You get in the jacuzzi.  We're talking.  We're laughing.  Kind of like here.  And then you jump in the pool.  You cool down.  You go into a snack.  Beverages.  You fucking snack.  Barbecues.  Pretzels and fucking...  The pantry.  There's chips and dips and fucking...  I knew he was waiting for someone to say... 
[01:22:00]  Because pretzels are...  Someone going to say it?  I don't know if it's worth a drive.  Well, you're cordially invited, Rich.  I would love to come.  Bring a bathing suit.  It's 10 minutes.  I know.  I would love to come.  I had a good time at your...  Oh, you'll like it.  Whatever party that was that you had that time.  I don't even remember.  I'm having another Labor Day party.  Labor Day...  I don't like Voss's...  It's on Sunday.  Voss's Hilton Head at a celebrity golf tournament.  I'm going to meet you.  Oh.  Yeah.  Here's the mistake.  You're like, who the fuck is this in the fucking foursome. 
[01:22:30]  I don't like Voss's little fucking non-calves.  Are you crazy?  Look at that.  Look at that.  He's got like little...  March of a rock.  Shut up.  Don't punch yourself.  Huh?  They're little non-calves.  Little babushka legs.  Yeah, they look like little elderly lady legs.  Aw.  Shut up.  But hairy.  A lot of people have their dumb fucking parties on Monday, on Labor Day.  I hate when people have parties where the next day is a work day.  It's like, when you can have it on Sunday, and everybody's off on Monday, why wouldn't you fucking do that? 
[01:23:00]  Like, people go, yeah, I'm having a party Monday.  Oh, that's great.  Then I could fucking, you know, feel like shit going into work.  Oh.  Yeah.  Be so tired, you could sleep for two days or something.  Exactly, Chip.  Fucking Chip.  Exactly.  Now, I just agree with him.  Like, yes, and then you move on.  Because I'm right.  Yeah, you're right, Chip.  So your party's on a Sunday.  Mine is Sunday.  The Labor Day party's going to be Sunday.  And Monday, you use as an alcoholic to recoup.  Right, to recoup.  But that's recouping from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  It's going to be a three-day bender. 
[01:23:30]  Just in case anybody dies.  A bender.  A three-day bender.  In case anybody dies at your party, you have that Monday to fill out the paperwork.  Well, no, to actually try to cover it up.  What's the day of the party?  What is it?  It's a Sunday.  The 30?  The one before the Monday.  That is Labor Day.  You have all fountains of young women.  Fountains?  Yeah, they look like they're fountains, but they're real women that you just put in cement.  That would be cool.  Yeah, what's it doing?  Snowing or something over there?  Case him. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, exactly, Chip.  Fucking Chip.  I can't handle Chip with the fucking non-smoking.  It makes me want to bite his cheek.  Why are you not smoking or something?  What are you not?  A chimney or something?  Wow.  Wow.  So, Rich, we do want to hear about the fire, what happened, how it started, where you stand  now as far as getting the place back.  Is it going to smell like smoke?  Oh, it's fucking horrible.  But first, it's fucking...  Hold on.  Keep laughing at it. 
[01:24:30]  Hillsboro volunteer fire department or fire department.  You're going to thank them or bitch at them?  They're fucking great.  They really are.  Why, they put out a fire?  No, no.  What are they supposed to do?  They're volunteers, you know, if you're a volunteer...  Hey, listen, how many volunteers say you know it's today?  Oh, so volunteer firemen aren't going to show up.  They love fucking fires more than the paint guys.  They set half the fucking fires.  That's what they did.  The fire...  They love fires.  They have the option of whether to go or not to go.  I know it's Friday night.  They don't.  Okay, maybe they don't have the option. 
[01:25:00]  Yes, they do.  They're volunteers.  They volunteer.  Do you think there are certain days where they all just don't show up and your house burns  down?  They're on call.  Okay, if you're a volunteer, but okay, if you're on call and there's a fire and they  go, I'm not going, you can't get fired.  You don't go, I don't go.  Yes, you can.  Yeah, you get fired.  They can tell you to leave.  And then you're not a fucking fireman anymore.  They do that because they want to be fired.  Are you that...  Are you fucking around?  They like being on the trucks.  They're not drafted. 
[01:25:30]  They go because they want to be a fireman.  It's like volunteers for the Red Cross.  So you're going to do something that you really enjoy and then fuck it up so they kick you  out.  Yeah, baby.  It's like getting kicked out of the Klan or something.  Or I should have picked another club.  Wait a minute.  It's like it's getting kicked out of something you enjoy doing.  The Kiwanis Club, right?  Yes.  They're volunteers.  They're not getting paid.  They're doing fucking...  They're putting their life on the line.  Like you should be a volunteer comic.  See, you guys team up. 
[01:26:00]  That's the problem here.  Ah, shit.  Well, anyhow, they were fucking great.  What happened?  They were great.  What did you say?  They were great.  Let's give it up for them.  They were fucking...  I'm telling you.  Were you afraid that they were actually going to point the hose across the street and hit  the fucking tree?  Yeah.  But they actually hit the fire?  These guys stink.  These guys know how to put out a fire.  Yeah.  Sure.  Okay, I'm in fucking California.  I'm in California, in Sacramento, outside.  We know where this is.  Nice enough alibi.  Outside.  Well, I'll get to that in a second. 
[01:26:30]  So, Bonnie calls.  Yeah.  She goes, I smell smoke.  So, I told her to go Google, maybe there's a big fire in Hillsboro.  You know, she smells it.  Maybe it's in the air.  There's a fire.  You know, and then I hear other people around the conference.  I don't want to interrupt, but there's going to be a lot of the interruptions during the  story.  Yeah.  Why would you tell her to Google something instead of, walk around the place and see  if something's burning?  Well, because inside our house, she said she smelled it on the outside.  Okay. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  So, I would never think our building would catch on fire.  One, because it's aluminum siding.  You know.  There's nothing under aluminum siding.  It's just aluminum siding.  When you smoke, you never, ever think it's your place.  That's true.  No, but they also make, it's like an erector set.  What?  Because that's what aluminum siding is.  It's just the aluminum with the metal inside and a couple screws and some insulation.  There's no wood, like, framing the house up. 
[01:27:30]  No.  Cement.  No, that's my sandwich, dude.  What is that, a big apple or something?  Sandwich.  Okay, so, because you never would think it's, right, you know.  So, Google something.  So, I said Google, see if there's a big fire in town, you know.  Listen, all you hear on TV, oh, look, these fires are out of, and people smell them all  over the place.  You know, you smell fires.  Yeah.  And you don't think, hey, you know, when you're driving, whatever. 
[01:28:00]  No.  So, I just said, go Google, see if there's, the way she said, I smell smoke, like, outside.  Uh-huh.  So, I go, go Google.  So, now, I guess, I can't remember if there was a call in between that, but I know the following  call, or the call I remember, maybe like an hour later, hour and a half.  Hour.  Wow.  Well, because, yeah, it was going forever before it started, supposedly, was, our place  is burning down.  That's it.  Okay.  It went from, I smell smoke to, our place is burning down. 
[01:28:30]  Our place is fucking burning down.  Now, as I'm talking, I mean, this, like, the first call, like, I smell smoke is, you  know, regular, and then this is a panic call.  Panic call.  I mean, this is fucking really panic.  So, now, I'm fucking like, okay, is she exaggerating?  You know, uh, you know, maybe they're, and she go, I go, you know, but no, this was a  panic call.  So, I go, okay.  Did you get mad at her?  Can I just ask a question?  I was having a wife myself. 
[01:29:00]  Did you get mad at her?  Like, well, fucking, what do you, did you start, like, it's her fault, even though it  wasn't her fault?  Yes, of course.  I go, what do you?  Because that's what I do all the time.  You just start yelling at her.  What do you mean this fucking shit's on fire?  How?  I didn't like it.  It's burning.  Shut up.  Try to put it out, you idiot.  That's why you need men.  Because they'd fucking, if there was a guy there.  You really do think it's the incompetent blundering of a woman.  Yes.  No matter what.  Yes.  It is.  Well, so, now I'm, I'm in fucking, in, in, uh, it's a Friday night. 
[01:29:30]  It's two Fridays ago, right?  Yeah, two Fridays.  Yeah.  I'm in a ranch show.  I got two shows.  So, I'm on the phone with Continental, packing my clothes to get a red eye.  And they got to fucking, the club is panicking because they got to refund 40 people.  That's right.  40.  I'll tell you what, I like that, I like that, I like, I like that joke better with the governors.  So, uh, well, so, I have to, now, I get a 1230 AM red eye on Friday night. 
[01:30:00]  So, there's two shows.  I call them, I say, you got to get somebody to cover this.  I got to do the first fucking show now.  And I'm on stage thinking my whole house is burning down.  And you're dealing with fucking drunken old guys.  Oh, man.  This guy, he's drunk, he's 45, 50, and he's acting like a complete ass.  And I'm going, look at you.  You're a fucking old drunk.  And you have no idea what's going on in my fucking life.  You're just a mess.  Okay.  Shouldn't you be somewhere having a pool party?  You know what I mean?  Right.  I get it. 
[01:30:30]  So, why would you get in the pool?  Why would you get all wet?  So, I get to fucking playing home.  I leave.  I'm on stage and I'm a fucking mess.  And then I go to the airport.  What other jokes did you do on stage?  What's that?  You ever do any other stuff?  I didn't do any jokes.  I don't do jokes anymore.  I do spoken word.  Wow.  That's rough.  I fucking, I don't like tired boss.  Do you want some bread to spread that sandwich on? 
[01:31:00]  Sure.  What?  You guys get a weight problem.  He doesn't have a weight problem.  Hey, fuck you, Norton.  Norton's fucking evil concern.  He's heavy, Seth.  He's a husky boy.  Okay, now here's the deal.  Ah, jeez, you spit your sandwich on my sandwich.  Now he's going to try to tell the story with a mouthful of sandwich.  Is that what put the fire out?  You talking to it?  It's volunteer.  Where are you going? 
[01:31:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  So, Bonnie, smoke smoke.  Holy shit.  Why would you, hold on.  He's got a mouthful.  You don't have to be a fucking radio expert to know that as you're telling a story about  your home burning, you shouldn't eat your egg sandwich.  Just wait until we're laughing about it.  He's never going to eat his sandwich.  He's fucking pieces of food.  Oh, my God.  He's got a hunk on mine.  What are you doing, Rich?  It's amazing how much food can just flood. 
[01:32:00]  There's some on his arm.  Look at you.  You're the worst.  Guys, guys, guys.  Covered in food.  It's on your pinky now.  He's been living in a high school fucking basketball court for the last week.  Exactly.  Hey, Katrina victim.  What happened next?  Fucking refugee.  Funny.  He's going to live in Houston in a fucking dorm.  Fucking FEMA trailer.  Swallow it, stupid. 
[01:32:30]  That's great.  Oh, I'd love you to choke it down.  Three people to wrap around him to give him the Heimlich.  It's going to be rig around the rosy Heimlich.  Oh, if he'd choke to death, nobody would try to save him.  Oh, I wouldn't be happy.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, that was almost dead right there.  Dude, thanks.  I would have died being made fun of.  That would have sucked.  Oh, Bob was really almost...  I think you're going to choke it and spit your food on Rich. 
[01:33:00]  And then I'm trying to get, you know, this story out of Rich and he's just pumping more  eggs into his face.  He's the one.  He chews gum on the air.  He fucking eats egg sandwiches in the air.  Hey, I'm a fucking volunteer.  In the middle of his own story.  Yes.  All right.  So what happened?  She smells smoke.  She smells smoke.  She smells smoke.  He's on a plane by now.  No, you're on a plane.  Unfortunately, the pilot didn't radio the same thing.  I smell smoke.  See, because that would have...  All right.  You know what? 
[01:33:30]  This is mean-spirited radio.  It really is.  I'm not doing it anymore.  It really is.  You're right.  I'm not a mean-spirited guy.  I have...  You know, I'm a new...  You're changed now, I think.  I'm changed.  I really am.  You're not changed.  You've felt adversity in your life now and loss.  And it's time now to...  Now?  Yes.  It's all he's felt.  55 years of adversity and loss.  Okay, so...  Yes.  Other people...  Everything in your life is written in the red column.  All right, go ahead.  Sorry.  Every...  Every...  Other people smell smoke smoke. 
[01:34:00]  So, supposedly...  Now she's sitting there.  There's no V in that word.  Supposedly.  What are you, Roman?  He speaks like the fucking sign in front of Carnegie Hall.  Supposedly.  Supposedly?  What is supposedly?  What the fuck is supposedly?  Supposedly.  It's supposed.  Supposedly.  Supposedly with a D.  Oh, good deal.  Technical fucking stuff.  You know what I'm trying to say.  Look, at least it's dumb. 
[01:34:30]  I'm not saying supposedly.  I'm dumb, but not that fucking dumb.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, okay.  Supposedly.  What happened?  Supposedly.  No, no.  Supposedly.  Supposedly.  Say it again.  Try it.  So, other people smell smoke.  So...  You have stuff on your lip.  Just done me.  So, stupid Bonnie.  Dumb Bonnie.  It's dumb words.  Dumb Bonnie is sitting on the bed.  With a black guy smoking.  Yeah.  Why did we still have a black guy? 
[01:35:00]  It's okay.  Because you hate that.  Because you don't want anybody fucking your wife, but you want a black guy fucking her  a little less.  Yeah, they found 19 Newports under his balcony.  Exactly.  Fucking hair gel caught on fire.  Against the couch, there's a big spot of it.  There's a size 14 sneaker.  You can put four of Voss' sneakers in.  That's very bad.  Yeah, how's that? 
[01:35:30]  All right.  So, yes, indeed.  Okay, so...  There's a crumpled fugu shirt.  She's on the bed with the kid, with the baby, with Raina.  With the kid.  Bad time for a fight.  And she's reading tarot cards.  And you would think it would be a fucking card.  Wait, wait, wait.  What is she reading?  Tarot cards.  Tarot cards.  Yeah.  What are they for?  Tarot cards?  Whatever they call it.  They call it carrot cards.  No, no.  For you.  Tara.  Tarot cards.  Tarot cards.  I don't even care anymore.  Yeah, tarot cards.  Tarot cards. 
[01:36:00]  What do they call it?  Tarot cards, right?  Yeah, it's tarot.  The credit cards.  No, Tara.  Tara.  Tara.  Whatever.  And there's not one card that says, hey, your house is burning, or fire card, or look.  So also.  So she's looking at fucking some kind of supernatural shit to determine if the house is burning.  Oh, no, no.  No, you fucking idiot.  Oh, I'm an idiot.  She was doing that just to, you know, because she does it, to see.  Okay.  Well, she called me earlier that day and said, the movie's locked.  So we were in a good mood.  Ah, right.  The movie.  Right.  It's locked. 
[01:36:30]  She called me.  Okay.  So, I guess she was doing her tarot cards, or whatever they call them.  And it's funny, because the inspector, when the investigator said to her, you know, what  we're doing, we'll get to the investigators in a second.  Oh, sure.  And she said, I was reading tarot cards, and he said, well, you're burning incense.  And she says, well, I'm not in a fucking cult, right?  Oh.  What are you, a comedian?  That's what she said.  So, next thing you know, she's in bed, and Raina sees a flame go up the fucking window.  Oh. 
[01:37:00]  And the four-year-old, you know, so.  By the way, she told you she was in bed reading tarot cards.  They were still on the fucking bed.  They had to be put there.  And what happened was, she had a friend over, and she was probably reading his future.  He's like, am I ever going to get out of the gang life?  And she's like, well, let's see.  Well.  And she thought the smoke was from his performance.  Well, she has to read cards to make ends meet.  Well, you know, to pay some of the bills while he's away.  He's saying that you're not doing well.  Yeah.  Are you the lady that reads the cards? 
[01:37:30]  That was the gist of it.  Naked?  Yeah.  And that's the cold word.  Naked?  Yeah.  I want to pay an extra 20 for naked reading.  Here's the thing.  Come on in.  Hey.  Go in your room.  Go in your room.  A pair of knee-length shorts around his ankles.  Oh, my Jesus.  My fantasy, you know, like, there was a guy there, but.  Stop eating a sandwich.  You're telling a story.  I'm holding it.  Relax.  Please let him eat it while he talks.  Just took a giant bite.  He bites his own little fingers. 
[01:38:00]  He really did.  Look at the size of that fucking punch.  What happened?  What happened?  That Mr. Ed.  Showed the house catching on fire.  Yeah.  The black guy runs out.  So the kid sees the flames outside the window.  Yeah.  Outside.  On the balcony.  So there's flames outside the house.  Mm-hmm.  And what's the next thing Bonnie does?  What do you mean? 
[01:38:30]  Like, she sees fire, so what?  She gets the baby and runs out of the fucking house.  Okay.  What do you think?  I don't know.  I don't know.  If someone said, Voss is telling a story, what's the next thing he did?  You wouldn't think ate a sandwich would be the logical answer.  I don't want it to get cold.  It's egg.  It's not tuna.  I know what it is.  And there you go.  Oh, man.  He's finishing it in three bites, by the way.  And of course he is.  The little sandwich.  Amazing.  Big giant teeth.  It's just fucking good to say. 
[01:39:00]  I know it is.  The story isn't.  How do you bore people with my house burned down story?  I know.  It's like you're the only person out of all of us that could ever tell this fucking story.  Jesus Christ.  You're talking about your house burning, and we're losing interest to want to talk about  Apple again.  All right, so let's get going.  This tarot cards.  Your wife summons Satan.  That's what happened.  She summoned the devil, and it lit the house on fire.  That's what happened.  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah.  God and devil boy. 
[01:39:30]  Well, so.  That's right.  So she runs out of the place with the kid.  She runs out of the place, so I get back the next day.  Now, if it was just outside.  Now, I might be giving people a little credit here for, you know, in the case of a  fire, I don't know what I would do.  I'd probably just leave the residence.  Oh, wait, wait.  But did she go back in to see what the fuck was burning, or?  No, it started outside on the balcony.  It didn't start inside.  It started outside.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  So you think she might.  She walked out there.  Yeah.  She walked out there.  Okay.  And couldn't see smoke. 
[01:40:00]  No one in the building could see smoke.  No one around.  But she saw flames by the window.  No, no, listen.  That's after the smoke.  That's after.  Three hours.  She smelled it in three hours early.  It was smoldering, but now the fire guys said that stuff can smolder without people seeing  smoke.  She's not the only one that smelt smoke.  There's other people that smelt.  And Bonnie doesn't believe that's what happened.  What?  I don't believe it started on Rich's patio because I'm not.  These are some CSI fucking guys that came and investigated.  But I also know common sense is Bonnie smelled it three hours before she smelled it. 
[01:40:30]  Nothing smolders for three fucking hours on a patio.  It's not like it was under a leaf bed in a closet.  Could have been in the wall.  No.  Listen.  It could have been in between the balcony's wooden slats.  Yeah.  So it could have been down in there.  It's just smoldering, but it's not smoking.  I don't know.  I'm not a fire fucking expert.  You're not?  I'm not an expert on anything, but definitely not buyers.  But if these guys, if they all say this is where it's, that's what they do. 
[01:41:00]  They go, this is where it started.  Okay.  Listen, I wish it would have started upstairs or they would have came down, you know, said  it's electrical or this or that.  But where did they say it started?  In the corner of our balcony.  And what was there that can burn?  There was a dry plant that was sitting there.  Just a plant.  Yeah.  Dried out plant that was dead.  Now, do you have people above you and below you?  Not above us.  Above us.  Above you.  Do they have balconies?  Yes.  And do they smoke?  Not the one I don't think above me does. 
[01:41:30]  Well, what do you think happened?  This is what I think happened.  It had to be an ignition source.  I think somebody walked by and flicked up a cigarette.  That's what I think.  That's a money shot.  You're right.  To flick up a cigarette into a dry plant.  The 10th floor are you on?  The 10th.  No, he's on the 30th.  Oh, shit.  I'm on the first floor, but the balcony is right above the carport.  Okay.  Okay, here's the thing.  Bonnie, you know Bonnie doesn't smoke. 
[01:42:00]  She doesn't smoke.  So, I know she doesn't have anybody over with my four-year-old sitting out there smoking.  And if she did, she wouldn't be dumb enough to have a fucking dude standing on our balcony smoking.  You know what I mean?  Huh?  None of your neighbors like you.  They're not going to tell you.  They'll all be happy for her.  It's not going to be out of the ordinary.  They'll probably see it a lot.  Yeah.  Another one of the kids' uncles stopped over. 
[01:42:30]  Anyhow, no one smokes in our house.  So, they'd probably think Bonnie is like a foster mom to big black guys.  Oh, Jesus.  Whoa, all right.  All right, whatever.  Go ahead, enjoy your yogurt.  Just because you grew up getting bounced from home to home.  Is that what you mean?  Okay.  Now he bounces everywhere.  Sorry, Bob.  I didn't mean to make any of your weight problems.  What about a balcony next to?  What about any balconies next to your balcony? 
[01:43:00]  There's a balcony right next to ours.  Right next to ours.  Do they smoke?  No.  So, no one smokes around.  He could have had a company.  Could I have a company?  No, but I don't think he did.  Could have been a cigarette.  Yeah, on a dry plant.  No, but here's the thing.  There's eight.  There's like seven other insurance companies.  You know, because everybody affected.  They all want to go after each other, insurance companies.  Yeah.  You know, nobody wants to.  You know, was there something faulty on your balcony?  Were you grilling?  No.  Were you, you know, making coffee?  They want to go after one.  Did you have a fucking, you know, hairdry? 
[01:43:30]  Whatever.  They want to go find.  They would love, the insurance companies would love to find a fault.  A fault of it.  A fault of the source.  You know, if it was us, because it's undetermined.  Will you get it out?  Jesus Christ.  If it was our negligence.  The words can come out as fast as that sandwich went in.  That's just amazing.  If it was our negligence, then the other insurance companies could sue my insurance company.  Right.  I know how insurance works.  I want to know how the fire works.  Yeah, okay.  What happened?  Is it right now?  Well, you're, I'm sorry, but will your homeowner's insurance be sued by the other insurance? 
[01:44:00]  If it was our negligence, I think so.  How about if it's not negligence?  How about if it literally is somebody, because that could have happened.  Somebody could have absolutely flicked a cigarette up.  Yeah.  People are scumbags.  You know.  What could that have been?  What could have been?  Like, say somebody did flick a cigarette up.  I mean, it's not, it's not our negligence if someone does it, if somebody, you know.  I bet you have a balcony above you.  Yeah.  They could have a company over.  We used to, when I lived at, when we lived on, over a building.  Don't act like you stood on a balcony. 
[01:44:30]  They, remember they had the balcony apartments going up?  Yeah.  I went out, we were going to buy one.  We were going to rent one.  Oh, right.  And we went out and we saw all these cigarettes.  And literally, while we were out on the balcony looking at the apartment, somebody dropped  a cigarette down on it from above.  Yeah, but the guy above me doesn't smoke.  But he could have had company over.  Could have had somebody over.  His wife also could have been fucking other people.  Yes.  Stop trying to fucking deny.  I know.  Who gives a shit?  I'm just saying it might have been that.  Might have been.  Hey, listen, fires.  Are we trying to solve the crime right now? 
[01:45:00]  Listen.  Fuck.  Investigators told me fires started.  Fires have started where birds are building nests.  We'll pick up a lit cigarette and place it into it.  Oh, but that didn't happen here.  No, I know.  But anything.  Mrs. O'Leary's cow also caused some damage.  But he wasn't on your fucking balcony.  Who?  Mrs. O'Leary's cow.  Mrs. Kelly's cow.  I'm sorry, man. 
[01:45:30]  I know what are you, moving or something?  That was a good one.  Sounds like a fun cartoon on Nickelodeon.  She does.  Mrs. Kelly's cow.  Just a cranky fucking non-smoking cow.  Hey, moo.  Go fuck yourself.  Take the bell off my neck.  You give your milk.  You walk around, you eat some hay.  You know what, dude?  One way or another.  The moo.  His worm friend fucking digs through the ground and pops up every once in a while. 
[01:46:00]  Hello.  Hello.  I believe he meant you, Jimmy.  I kind of got that when you said worm friend.  Of course.  You're a worm.  I would love to get to the bulk of the...  I'm getting to it.  Fucking testimony here.  But what do you mean the bulk?  There's no answer.  I just want to hear like...  No.  So the answer.  So here's the thing.  I want a dramatic fire story.  Something like...  Sorry.  A dramatic fire story?  Something happened.  It's burning.  She's out there holding a baby.  And she sees... 
[01:46:30]  Now there's flames.  What the fuck?  Oh, sorry.  It didn't happen that way.  Oh, what happened?  The whole house just smoldered down?  Is that what it was?  So they came, you know, and they're questioning her and stuff, and they're pretty good.  But you didn't even get to the part with the fire department.  Oh, they were great.  Like, I know they were great, but...  Only my bedroom.  Only the top.  Like, nothing really...  The bedroom, I can't explain it.  Like, half the bedroom.  Obviously.  It's not really burnt, but it's gone.  Like, all the... 
[01:47:00]  My bedroom's gone.  Like, some of it burned inside.  But they stopped it from going in and up.  If it would have got in the house and went up, forget it.  It went up the side of the building.  You know what I mean?  Into the roof.  I don't know about the other places upstairs.  So they wrecked your bedroom.  The bedroom.  And what about, like, did smoke damage to a lot of shit?  No.  That's what got us the smoke and water damage.  Except for the wall is fucking gone.  You know?  And all my clothes and furniture are upstairs.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Who was it that said Bonnie... 
[01:47:30]  Was it that Bonnie that said Bonnie wanted to get rid of all of his golf clothes?  That was Bonnie.  Oh, Bonnie said that.  Oh, Bonnie said that.  I wanted to get rid of his golf clothes.  You know, his golf clothes stink.  Bonnie and Rich came to the cell last night.  And what did she say to you?  Because someone asked me.  Oh, Bonnie.  He was cracking at me.  Bonnie made fun of his...  And Bonnie told me, just start crying.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  I would just times, not now, but for days, a couple of days after it, you'd be driving  and I'd stop and I'd just almost start crying because there's so much to deal with, with 
[01:48:00]  insurance companies, moving stuff all over, bouncing.  No, I don't need money.  Just say yes, stupid.  No, why?  What do you mean money?  Take money from this fucking little guy.  I'm not going to give you a deal.  I was going to say, Anthony, you want to help him out?  No.  Me.  That's what I said to him on the night it happened.  He called me.  I was in Utah.  Yeah.  You are Utah.  Tor?  First of all, there's no R in Utah.  Is he New Jersey in pants?  Shut up.  I got a stomach.  He calls me up.  I'm like...  In four bites, of course.  Not from the sandwiches.  The nicotine you're swallowing and those awful jokes. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, we're all bombing now.  What happens?  You know what?  I know better.  I'm not even finishing this fucking story.  What happened in Utah?  Nothing happened in Utah.  This is what happened.  Wow.  It's funny.  Two minutes now, the curtains are going to be on fire here.  So.  So, so.  Fucking.  What kind of...  Wait a minute.  It sounded like your asshole was winking.  That's like a balloon when you...  That's like a...  When you pull the fucking edges of it. 
[01:49:00]  It sounded like a mummy farted.  It's right in the ages about, right?  You're always going to get a fucking beat in today.  Inflammable.  Like, I happen to know there's no way the rest of this story is coming out.  No, it is.  And we should take a break.  No, no.  Okay.  Take a break.  We'll have all day to finish it.  Yeah.  We're fine.  We'll have all day to finish it.  But also, before I forget to...  Oh.  He's shaking his granola.  Why?  That just...  It was the same clarity that story was coming out in.  I've just contributed as much useful information to that story. 
[01:49:30]  Because there's no answer.  You think you're smarter than the fucking investigators.  No, I don't.  I just believe Bonnie, and I think that even though I know it happens and they give you  some kind...  You know, sometimes pterodactyls are hit by lightning and they burn...  I get it.  And I would believe that, but only because she was very adamant about it.  She didn't think so.  And she went out on the balcony, and other people in the buildings...  For a fire on a balcony, for her to only smell it for a few minutes, I would believe that.  No, if you smell it throughout for, you know... 
[01:50:00]  I know.  That's what you're saying.  Yeah.  But for her to smell it three hours, and other people to smell it, and no one to see it on  a fairly plain balcony, I don't buy it.  Let's have firemen call and see what they say, if that can happen.  I don't care what they say.  I've done volunteer fire fighting.  I just would never show up.  They fired me.  Don't call.  That entails me answering them.  Oh, fucking just answer phone calls.  How about we'll talk when we come back?  Oh, come on.  Yeah, we'll do that.  We're at Governors, right?  We're at Governors, man.  Yes, Governors.  Governors.  Come on.  Fill it up while I go in the pool. 
[01:50:30]  And that would be tomorrow night and Saturday at Governors, right there in Levittown.  Go to govs.com.  Yeah, go to see Rich this weekend.  He'll be staying in the parking lot all weekend in his car.  Wow.  What the fuck?  But he actually could stand in his car fucking shrink.  What does that fucking mean?  It means you've fucking got no home.  So you've got to stay at the pool.  I have no home.  I'll be standing in the parking lot.  Huh?  You want to try that one again?  Wait, you know what?  Let's let him regroup. 
[01:51:00]  And he came in on fucking fire.  Oh, well.  He did.  He came in.  And you couldn't describe it to us.  He came in like a...  I think you know what happened to your place.  Because Bob did smoke.  And now all of a sudden he quits.  Maybe someone's got guilt.  That's what happened.  Oh, shit.  Bobby was over there.  Because they get along very well.  And Bob was fucking giving her an average dicking.  Oh, shit.  And Bob was...  I could tell if Bob was there.  Because our bed is still level. 
[01:51:30]  We'll be right back after.  There's no bite marks in the stove.  After these short words.  Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire everywhere.  There's a fire in the closet.  There's a fire in the bed.  There's a fire sitting under my chair.  There's a fire in the sink.  It's so hot I'm turning pink.  Oh, doesn't anyone care?  Then he reached up with his arm.  And he pulled down the alarm. 
[01:52:00]  And he knew the engines would soon be there.  Sirius XM.  This is the virus.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. Live.  Here's the latest batch of F.E.E.R.S.  E.R.S.  Fuck you.

How about Roland comes in here to conduct business?  During the breaks, we just want to, like, break, I guess.  And Roland's always,  Here, we want to watch this. 
[01:54:30]  Here, we want this guest.  I was like, ah.  That's where he gets me in my weakest point, though.  Because then I'll be like, yeah, okay, whatever.  Because I just want to relax.  I got my feet up on the console.  I'm leaning back on my chair.  But he's smart.  Why go into a fucking room full of vultures before they ate?  He comes in after they ate.  That is true, yeah.  Why should he come in and submit himself to this fucking meanness?  Everything calms down during the break.  It calms down.  He knows after the show there's not a chance in hell of catching me. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And he's smart, you know.  I hear you.  I hear you.  What was I saying?  Oh, that was it.  Oh, no, hold on.  Oh, you got stuff to me?  No, I just wanted to.  I want to wrap up the fire.  Oh, if you can wrap it up, that's fine.  What I'm saying is I thank the Hillsborough Fire Department.  I think they did a great job.  Even the detective that smashed Bonnie.  I kind of liked him because he was a real ass.  Yeah.  This detective was an ass.  The insurance companies, well, they're kind of creepy. 
[01:55:30]  You know, but ours is good.  They got to check and make sure that they don't.  I mean, there is a part where there's shenanigans going on.  But the inspectors are so good.  Like, I was in California and I'm thinking, this is how good.  You know, when people are in jail, you know, they're in question for 17 hours.  By the way, Bobby is now on the button.  You could see them, you know, going, maybe I did do this.  I'm in California going, you know what they're doing.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, they got me.  You know, maybe.  But.  Conveniently, you're 3,000 miles away. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  You were actually doing a show while this was going on.  Great alibi, yeah.  Boo!  Whoa.  Now he's a prop act.  Can't prop you up or something.  Boring.  All right, look.  Oh, what?  So, insummation.  Here's the thing.  No, don't say insummation.  He's going to go, where's that?  Is that what my gig is? 
[01:56:30]  What I'm saying is.  Yeah.  Send me stuff.  Send.  Rich needs things.  Are you okay for money?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah, I'm okay.  I got two daughters in college.  Yeah, things are good.  I told him if he needs any socks, I have socks.  Dude, I need socks.  I'm all kidding.  I know the fire's bad, but I fucking had a hole in the heel of my sock.  Not to compare the two.  That's terrible.  Wow.  So, now, do you drive by it and cry?  I go in there every day.  I got to go get it.  I fucking, I was there yesterday because we put, you know, I had a closet full of stuff 
[01:57:00]  that wasn't.  You lived in, faggot.  That wasn't.  That wasn't.  You know, it's not.  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  Go ahead, Mitch.  Sorry.  I had a ticket to storage yesterday.  You're fucking stored.  You're going bald?  No.  What?  What an asshole.  No, I'm just kidding.  We're talking about his house, you know, just smashing him for his house and his wife  cheating on him and he fucking throws in.  You're going bald?  Because nothing could be that bad.  That's too far.  Okay.  Oh, that's, he meant that to Bobby. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, no.  Bob, that's not right.  Go ahead.  Uh, you know, ladies, ladies, ladies.  Yeah.  How would you like a dream date?  I'm available.  Dan, no, no.  It's with Daniel Bobo.

Double your ticket price.  Why, Rich?  Nothing.  Because he found some pearls around his neck, too.  Come.  I went, I went, I told you that.  Yeah.  I went in the fucking North Carolina.  I went digging for, you know, you dig for jewels to lay your eggs. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, really?  A lot of us go to the diamond just.  Fucking sea turtle.  What the fuck?  Why are you digging for jewels?  Because he's burying bones.  What?  Nothing.  Exactly.  I don't know.  He just told his joke.  I know.  I just, I don't, I don't, you were really doing this.  I think I told you that.  I went out, yeah.  Yeah, you pay, you go out in the fucking woods of North Carolina. 
[02:01:30]  Apparently you can do it in upstate New York, too.  I didn't need to fly.  Yeah.  You can go upstate New York to have it in New Hampshire.  What were you looking for?  You go out in the woods and they have these mines.  And for 50 bucks, you can get a bucket of already dug dirt.  Yeah.  And go to a sleuthing table.  Wait, you can't bring your own bucket?  You gotta pay, buy a $50 bucket?  50 bucks, you're buying a bucket of dirt for $50?  You don't think they sift through it before they give it to you, you idiot? 
[02:02:00]  Hang on, hang on.  Here's the pie.  I thought it was stew.  Here's the pie.  Oh, booyah, baes.  Fucking, you don't think they sift through that dirt before they hand it to some asshole  from New York?  There's nothing in there.  You got luggage with LaGuardia airport tags on them, you dummy.  This is the brilliance of Boss.  Boss is having a bad day.  His dumb fire story's tanking. 
[02:02:30]  Do you remember?  Yes.  He remembers something I said a couple, three weeks ago.  And he brings it up because he knows I'm a fucking needy twat.  And I just want to talk about my life.  Right?  And have people listen.  So I bring it up.  And I forget where I am.  That I'm actually feeding sharks.  Of course you are.  Well, I have a $50 bucket to do it with him.  He thought it was and he thought it was stew. 
[02:03:00]  What a dummy.  A big $50 bucket of stew.  I bought the hundred.  Wait, stop.  There's $50 buckets.  Then there's $100 buckets.  That's right, and they all have been that's got twice as much worthless dirt in it.  And then there's three buckets.  The earth is made of it, you asshole.  How much for the air?  There's a shithead.  There's $250.  There's $250 buckets.  Here's a $1,000 pile of leaves. 
[02:03:30]  Fucking cut.  $250 bucket.  Well, here's...  I got...  I got the $100 bucket.  Why don't you stand it and tell everybody you're an asshole, Plance?  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please hold, please.  So you want the $100 bucket.  So I get the $100 bucket. 
[02:04:00]  Right.  Does your wife get a bucket, too?  You get her a bucket?  You split the bucket?  Stop saying buckets, you fucking asshole.  $100 buckets.  I know.  I got a $100 bucket.  I wish you were doing a list of things so it was on...  Forget it.  I don't know where you were going.  Bucket list, yeah.  So...  You got the $100 bucket.  You got the fat kid from Nantucket.  Spend $300 on dirt in a bucket.  He said if I could find my cock, I would fuck it. 
[02:04:30]  He just spit all over.  Oh, he came up for air.  He just spit water all over.  He just came up for air.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Water went everywhere.  And it did look like a dolphin coming up.  I don't know.  A dolphin?  A dolphin? 
[02:05:00]  A dolphin?  You fucking jackass.  All right, so...  He's being eaten by the whale.  I apologize.  You put dirt.  Ah, fucking...  Well, uh...  So we get...  Wow.  Fucking Voss.  Well, hold on.  Tell us about your fucking mining experience.  I like being fucking really sidetracked your shit story.  That was fun.  I would love to know what happened with all this money in buckets of dirt.  You can either buy the bucket or you can buy a shovel in an empty bucket. 
[02:05:30]  And go out to the woods and just fucking dig.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So we decided to get a bucket to go through it to see what we're looking for.  To know what...  Because, you know, they...  It's not like...  What a...  How much are these guys laughing?  But here's the deal.  These Yankees coming down there buying dirt in a bucket.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  Thinking there's going to be gems in it.  I didn't know this, but all of a sudden you start sleuthing, all of a sudden a beautiful  purple rock and then a red rock and then this crazy fucking green rock and you... 
[02:06:00]  I mean, there's fucking stones everywhere.  These are in the buckets that they handed you.  Right?  So they're all in these buckets.  Exactly.  You sleuthing out.  They're fucking marbles, you idiot.  They're perfectly round.  They're not...  They're not...  I mean, they're fucking beautiful.  Oh my God, rocks.  And the ladies come out...  The same kind of rocks you can see in any store on fucking 44th Street, right?  Yeah.  Those type of rocks.  You're talking about gem rocks?  Nothing.  Go.  Wow.  Really?  Is that how it works?  What did you think?  If you just kept saying words, magic would show up? 
[02:06:30]  That's what he thinks all the time.  All right.  But I never bought a $50 bucket of dirt.  Should have.  You could have thrown it on the fire.  His house burnt down.  Ladies and gentlemen, of course, Andy Levy here.  Fox News' red eyes.  Andy Levy, which is how we were told we were supposed to introduce you.  Yeah.  Excellent.  By somebody over there at Fox.  Jesus, Opie, you look like shit.  You should actually sit here.  You look like Opie. 
[02:07:00]  Damn.  Poor Bobby.  Bobby told us he bought a $50 bucket of dirt.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he went down to...  Where was it?  Virginia?  North Carolina.  One of those places.  And he didn't realize that the worms are everywhere, and he wanted to go fishing.  What?  And you get to buy these buckets of dirt, and then you go through them to find gems.  And like, they wouldn't check every...  No, but here's the thing, is that they have...  All of a sudden, you look, and the lady comes around, and you're at a sleuthing table with a bunch of other... 
[02:07:30]  A sleuthing table with a bunch of other fat messes.  At least he saved on his flake, because all they did was write Goodyear on him.  I paid for that.  You pretty much spend your entire paycheck on lottery tickets, don't you?  That sounds like something.  Paycheck?  Yeah.  I don't work for Fox, asshole, or whatever.  What the fuck?  No, you had a pizza parlor this weekend.  Where do all your wages go?  I like that.  I signed this?  Can you please cash this for me? 
[02:08:00]  The $50 you make for your gigs is what I'm talking about.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Andy's playing rough ball today.  Shut up, you fucking red eyes.  Andy's used to brawling now on Twitter, so he's ready to...  Andy, can you wait an hour and do the halftime report on this show?  Oh, Jesus.  You won't be mentioning your name.  I like that his insult, he fucking delivered it like the 1940s.  Your $50 wages. 
[02:08:30]  I gotta know what the fuck with these dumb buckets.  Well, they gotta go out and dig, too.  All of a sudden, the lady goes, that's an emerald.  That's an emerald.  That's a ruby.  What is she gonna say?  No, but it is.  More worthless.  It's not that it's not.  She's pointing at that going at an emerald, and then when you leave, she's pointing at  you going, and that's a dummy.  It's not.  I gotta show you a picture of this shit.  But how is it that there'd be all these gems in one bucket? 
[02:09:00]  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because they buy them and put them in the buckets for fucking losers to come down.  And we didn't know this until the next day.  We went to another place, and this was just a redneck dude, and he goes, and he didn't  even put dirt.  Like, it was just sand.  Like, he just takes, he didn't even, he didn't even, these people, these people get the dirt 
[02:09:30]  and put it in, so you like, it looks like it was dug from the ground.  This guy just has sand, and there's just jewels sticking out of it, like these rocks,  these purple rocks.  You're like, what the fuck?  And you're just picking them out, like, this is like a child.  They've never made a diamond movie out of North Carolina, have they?  When I think fucking emeralds, I don't think Raleigh.  You should make a movie about that and call it Bloodstool.  He, he, he, it sounds terrible. 
[02:10:00]  You weren't mining for fucking your bucks, you did.  Listen to me, Ralph Crabbin.  Okay.  We're going to make a fortune, Alex.  Corey Apple?  I, but this is the thing, though, is that I did get a couple, the lady would come by and  and go, that's, like it was corn.  She'd go, she'd go, that's a ruby, that's an emerald right there, that's an emerald, 
[02:10:30]  and it looks like a rock.  Yeah.  Because they are rocks.  And then there's a thing, wait, wait, wait, there's a thing.  Did you notice that your fingers were the same color as the stones after you picked them  up?  Because there's fucking paint?  Just making sure.  Well, we got the joke.  I want to make sure I'm clarifying.  Because it's paint, and they painted it on, and that's how they, shut up.  All right.  Make sure your oxtail isn't hitting the fucking dog's tags on that.  Wait, wait, no!  You don't have the responsibility to work the machine. 
[02:11:00]  Throw in the garbage.  I've had it.  I like that you make my twink take it out, too.  You know what?  Go hide that.  We'll see if Bobby can find it.  I'm looking bad.  And, wow, Bill Schultz is here.  That's right.  Of course, Andy came ten minutes before me.  Like, the teacher's test.  Fox, red eyes, own, yes, Bill Schultz.  Because we were told to introduce you to you like that. 
[02:11:30]  Thanks, guys.  I'm looking at an introduction like that.  You've got TVs.  I've got own.  This is early for you to be up, isn't it?  It is.  I can hear your voice.  This is like, that's the same voice I used to use when I called in to work.  Yeah, I'm not feeling too good this morning.  I was walking here.  I was like, if I walk a little fast, maybe that'll wake me up.  Because I don't have time for coffee.  But no, it doesn't work.  I'm not letting him off the hook, are you?  What?  Shut up.  The test of my line isn't strong enough.  Come on.  See, it's a fishing joke. 
[02:12:00]  I mean, you got it.  I got it.  Fucking child molester.  I got it.  I hope you get caught.  Did you fly down?  Just because he went down with three barrels on him.  Did you fly down to North Carolina just to do this?  It's a fair question.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  No, you didn't.  Hang on.  I saw vacation.  Your wife went with you?  Oh, yes.  She wants to go to Hawaii?  Hang on.  You're a cartoon character.  Hang on.  This is like Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin would do this. 
[02:12:30]  Hang on, honey.  I got a plan.  Buckets of rocks.  A friend of mine actually was, there are legitimate places.  No, they're wrong.  Africa.  Africa.  Africa.  Exactly.  Okay.  In Africa.  Are there any children with their arms missing?  If there was a place where you could dig up a bucket of dirt and find all these gems,  no one would be allowed on it.  There'd be fucking mining equipment.  It is a mine. 
[02:13:00]  No, some of them are mines.  None of them are yours.  They're all other people's.  I just came into this, but all I'm thinking is Bob Kelly and blood diamonds.  That's what I've heard so far.  You're traveling.  It's illegal.  He went to Virginia or wherever the hell you are.  North Carolina.  I just always say those states.  They're all the same.  Virginia's for cold diggers.  For what?  That's like you have a speech impediment trying to say vagina.  What did you just say?  Cold diggers?  Cold diggers, yes.  Get them jackets.  All right, got it.  I really hope you choke on that muffin. 
[02:13:30]  And they gave a bucket full of dirt.  Yeah, they do, really.  I'd pay $50.  How much are you fucking eating?  You ate already.  What the fuck is this?  He's homeless.  It's a radio show.  His hotel doesn't have continental breakfast.  Really?  All right.  I'll give him that one.  This is really a mess.  So, Bobby, it didn't give you a clue?  Where are you?  That this lady running this shack who's selling dirt isn't a fucking millionaire.  Maybe that might be a clue that there's not a bunch of gems in this. 
[02:14:00]  She dressed very dirty and down.  I'm so confused.  Well, here's the thing.  Here's the thing that I'm leaving out.  At the end of the Jewel, there's two other parts of the story.  You can just buy the bucket and sleuth, and there's magic rocks.  There's magic rocks.  You learn sleuthing this thing.  It's a board game.  Apple and diamonds.  I got to fill Bill in.  He buys these buckets of dirt in this place, and you go to the sleuthing table.  I don't know what this is.  It's a fucking table with water.  It's with water, and gems are in this dirt, because this whole real estate is full of gems. 
[02:14:30]  What are you, a 49er?  You pay hundreds of dollars.  These gems are in their dirt.  He's a 349er.  Wait, did you see?  Did you see how excited he got?  This cocksucker.  Wait, wait.  She got really excited.  I can say that.  You wanted that one out in the back.  I almost turned your mic down. 
[02:15:00]  I'm having control of the mic.  It's not a good thing.  Yeah, and it's a big scam.  Oh, it doesn't sound like it.  Really?  There's nothing that sounds more legit than this.  Hang on one second.  I've got reservations to go next week.  Really, Geraldo?  It's a scam?  No shit, dummy.  You mad asshole.  Yeah, and I came back.  I'm telling you, it's a scam.  I have a bucket.  Could you bling your head over and shake your ear over it?  I need some fucking...  Get it, Rox.  Yeah.  Wow.  Was there any...  Why didn't you turn my mic off during that one? 
[02:15:30]  You did.  At least I turned some radios off.  Yeah.  Your mic is like, my name's not Mike.  Shut up, Chip.  Fucking Chip, you asshole.  Was there any Hasidics there?  I've got the where and the what, but I'm still real confused as to the why.  I am too.  What?  Like, you saw this and figured you were going to do it?  It was exciting?  Wait, hold on.  Let me answer Bill's question.  Where in North Carolina?  The what?  Ripped off why?  He's a dumb motherfucker.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  We're done here.  We're good.  See you guys.  Thanks for listening to Obi and Anthony this week.  We fucking...  Well, here's another thing.  This is another part of the fuck you.  You can either go in the woods and get a bucket for 20 bucks  and a shovel, which I did.  Anything involving a bucket, I'm in.  I went out into the woods.  This is the funniest part.  You go into the woods and you can...  There's only certain parts, because it is an emerald mine.  Yeah.  So there's only certain parts you can dig.  Sounds like a Tolkien novel. 
[02:16:30]  We enter the emerald mine after repeating two phrases to the dwarf.  So we walk out and it's all holes.  Like, it's been dug.  I mean, dug and dug.  There's no place...  It just...  So we start digging.  Five hours of digging.  I dug a hole that you could fucking fit a car in.  Okay?  Because you're supposed to...  And you lay down in it.  Ah, the fucking fat jokes.  I just...  They're just...  They're just...  Yeah.  Just right off the... 
[02:17:00]  They're right there.  It really is.  I could never in my life be not fucking gettable.  I've never in my life be not fucking weight.  I've never...  What'd you say?  Don't be...  Learn some weight.  Don't be fat.  Don't be fat.  Yes, it's easy.  Maybe dig holes every fucking day.  I would never do that to you, Kelly.  So, Bill...  That's why I love you, Bill.  I feel very sensitive for him.  That's because you're as sickly as he is on the other end.  Listen, hepatitis C. 
[02:17:30]  We can get into the tan batting thing as well.  So, you're digging and digging.  First of all, you've got fucking Levy and Bill.  And then us.  This is just not good, this show.  This show.  All I see from...  From now on, I'm team Bob.  You're getting gamed up here.  I just see evil eyes looking at me.  Everyone's just looking around.  I'm giving you love.  How can I fuck over the guy that's talking?  Levy's blue eyes of death.  I'm just waiting to fucking say something.  That's accurate. 
[02:18:00]  Ah, shit.  All right, so...  What happened?  So, you dug the big hole.  So, I dug...  Found nothing.  You find, like...  Of course.  I forget what it is.  Some white crystal.  I want everyone to sit down for that.  You found what?  Nothing?  White crystal.  White crystal.  Meth.  Now, all of a sudden, I'm interested.  Hang on, what was it?  What was it?  Dandruff.  He's about to look at his shoulder for that.  He's on that new show, Breaking Chairs.  Or performing band. 
[02:18:30]  And all I have to do is stop talking.  And it ends.  I can't.  But you can't.  You can't.  It's about you.  I know.  I know.  It's about me.  But it's all you want to stand around 10 years.  It's like Braveheart.  Say it. 
[02:19:00]  Repent.  And it all ends.  Except it's Strainheart.  It all ends.  I know.  When the boss was telling the story, why did you stop?  You can't.  You can't.  You can't.  You can't stop.  You can't, man.  It repents.  And it all ends now.  It's like fucking eating.  You just can't stop.  Now you will be punished by pain.  Yes.  Okay, here's the worst part.  Pain will be gone.  Here's the worst part.  What the fuck?  Sorry.  I'll get a phone call. 
[02:19:30]  Why is I always taking a phone call?  Come on.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, Joe from Chicago?  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh, he sounds like me.  No, I was going to say, he's leaving out the last part of the scam, which is once you  pick your fake diamonds up, he locked his all in.  Now he can't be hung up on.  You don't know how to work the phones.  Ah, look, Mars has to come over.  Good job, Bobby.  Yeah, there you go.  Jesus Christ.  The phones aren't on the sloop table. 
[02:20:00]  Come on, Sam.  Get on the fucking thing.  Sam, hang up that phone line.  Hang up the phone, you fucking twat.  What clusterfuck.  What happened?  I want to know.  This kind of language.  Here's the worst part of it.  You ready?  So they have this hut.  When you're done, they have this hut with these guys.  They have a hut?  They have these hut with these guys in it, and you bring your stones in.  And these guys, they got like these fucking...  When you went in the hut, did they call you Jabba?  That was good. 
[02:20:30]  It was just mean enough, but his nerdy fucking Star Trek reference deserves hot talking.  Star Trek wars.  No, shit.  It's a fucking dumb fucking side function.  If it was Star Trek, it would have been a Harry Mudd joke.  All the geeks are laughing their asses off.  Don't worry about it.  DeRosa's fucking...  I get it.  I get it.  He's pushing his dumb glasses back in his dark circles, he calls eyeballs.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  So you go up to this hut, and this guy's in there.  And there's a bunch of guys in there.  And a soldier comes in and chops you to pieces.  I wasn't far off with that.  And you dump your rocks out, all the rocks you get, and he tells you which ones.  This is a good one right here.  This is an amethyst.  Oh, he tells you.  So he tells you.  It gets worse.  Cubic zirconium.  This is very rare.  This is tiger eye.  Because he wouldn't keep the most valuable one for himself. 
[02:21:30]  He would just give it to you.  This is emerald.  This is ruby.  This is quartz, orange quartz, and all this crazy shit.  You found all the ones we buried for you.  Well, that's the thing, is that they put them in the buckets.  They buy them from...  Of course they do.  They buy them.  But they don't tell you that.  They buy them.  Then you find them in the sleuthing thing.  Then you bring them to this guy, and he's like, this is a good one.  You can make this into an earring.  So then you make it all like, oh, yeah, how much does that cost?  Well, it's $30 to fucking polish it down.  Then he buys them back. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  No, this is what he does.  I'll tell you what he does.  He takes the...  This is what he does.  He takes the rocks that you...  When you give them, when you say, I want this as earrings, I want that as a ring,  I want that as a necklace.  He'll throw your rocks back into the bucket, and he has them polished already.  Already tumbled and made.  Already red.  They don't do shit.  And they tell you it takes like six weeks.  Seven weeks.  This is fucking dumb.  So I did 500.  My wife's like, I like this.  I'm like, we're just fucking stupid.  $500 worth of shit.  I would admire these guys if I thought that anyone but Bob would fall for this. 
[02:22:30]  I know.  I didn't see how this is marketable.  I was in a line waiting to get my rocks evaluated.  Don't kid yourself.  That is amazing, really.  There's a bunch of people going, really?  A ruby?  But I called and canceled my whole fucking order when I found out that it's all...  You're a little hero.  The guy who went to the next day.  The guy who went to the next day, he had...  Like Ralph Nader.  But you went back to another one?  We went back to another one, but thank God.  Because this guy was like, yeah, let me...  They gave you a bucket and you were like, oh my God. 
[02:23:00]  So then we went to a legit ruby mine.  He goes, I put all these in myself.  He goes, it's supposed to be fun.  This isn't real.  He goes, do you think this rock comes from the ground here?  He goes, no.  But he did...  His land is on a mine.  He found a diamond.  He has emeralds.  There's a lot of emeralds.  It was a fucking 10-carat diamond he found on the ground.  Oh, of course he did.  But he finds all the shit.  He already did.  He also found this $5 snow globe that was from the Paleolithic era. 
[02:23:30]  No, you can't...  There is a dinosaur bone one that is...  The sad thing is I would do that.  If it was a dinosaur bone one, I would sign up for that.  You find dinosaur bones.  You find fossils.  That's great.  But they bought those two and throw them in sand.  And the bucket they give you is KFC bucket.  Because they're just...  Chicken bones.  That's not a reason.  Dinosaur bones.  Because I ate all the chicken?  Sir, this is a fully attacked T-Rex rubber from Taiwan. 
[02:24:00]  Era 1988.  Well, upstate New York, you can go and you can dig for...  Thank you for pointing out.  Exactly.  Back in that quest.  Holy shit.  It doesn't end.  This chair is...  Listen to me.  Do not step out of this.  This chair is fucking brutal.  Just leave...  Just leave it alone.  I don't like how you know how the chair feels.  Just leave it alone.  Do you know how fucking depressed that chair is?  It's used to Opie being on it.  And all of a sudden...  Well, at least... 
[02:24:30]  At least Bobby washes his pants every so often.  And there's no boogers being wiped on it.  Oh, Jesus!  Oh, now it's all over shit!  The chair is like my back hurts, but it smells better.  Rich took the gloves off.  And a baby's wearing him now.  See his tiny hands.  It's also about looking Anthony in the eyes and just slowly nodding its head like this.  So, I'm happy with this chair.  Yeah, you're in a high chair.  So, Bobby, you going back to North Carolina this weekend? 
[02:25:00]  Well, you can go upstate New York.  Oh, I forgot about that.  And you can dig for these rocks, and if you shake them, you hear it clanging inside.  There's diamonds.  That's your brain, you fucking idiot.  Diamonds?  No, seriously.  No, it's a fucking...  I know what they call these things.  Google it.  It's an egg with silly putty in it.  Is that what we're talking about?  It's rocks.  Congrats on the find.  You would like you to shake fucking...  They're called chestnuts.  Hang on, hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on, go ahead.  I'd like you to shake a box of sweating dynamite. 
[02:25:30]  Because you're diamond.  Yeah, I get that.  Sweating dynamite.  No, there's a certain mineral that does...  It's round.  It looks like a...  Science Anthony?  ...kind of nodule.  And you shake it, and there are crystals inside, but they're not fucking diamonds.  No, but you can.  You know what, they're right.  No, but you can.  They're magic.  It's a big rock, and if you shake it, you can hear smaller rocks inside.  Yes.  Inside, they're diamonds.  No, they're not diamonds. 
[02:26:00]  They shouldn't make it in front of you.  They're diamonds.  When you get to break it open and see the diamonds...  Why don't you use your teeth to break it open?  It's called a geode.  That comes from meat curtains, so it's gotta be true.  Rich, you have to take it over to the shaking table.  Yes.  And then the guy shakes it for you.  Does that cost?  Well, it's $50 to shake, and then he tells you...  Because he can tell by hearing.  He's an expert.  Oh, those are diamonds.  You can have those made into earrings. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  And then you pay $1,000, and seven weeks later, you get diamonds.  You don't have to fly, and you can drive, because it's upstate.  I wish there was a guy after Voss' show that shook his DVDs.  No, this isn't a good one.  Yeah.  And wow, that was working.  At least he didn't drag his wife there to fucking do it with him.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, at least my wife doesn't light the house on fire.  Oh, that was brutal.  Oh, that was mean. 
[02:27:00]  When they were walking me in here, I was like, so what did I miss?  Like, Rich Voss' house was on fire.  That was all they told me.  Rich house burnt down, yeah.  His house burnt down.  He's very sorry.  Yes.  Unfortunately, his notebook's for his vacation.  Unfortunately, his notebook wasn't in there.  Well, any of your fine vacations.  I've got plenty of new stuff.  And we can see it at Governor's.  What is that?  Tomorrow night and Saturday at Governor's in Levittown.  Thank you.  How many times have you seen me do stand-up?  Twice.  How many times have I killed?  Twice.  Thank you. 
[02:27:30]  I know.  It's great.  We're not saying you're not funny, stupid, but hilarious.  There you go.  Talking in drinks again.  What?  What?  I know I'm very funny.  So what are you saying?  Nothing.  Talking in what?  Nothing.  What are you talking about?  You suck.  Are you?  There's something wrong with you.  I ain't fuck.  Jesus Christ.  You need bombs and you catch him and he's like, what?  What?  Keep it moving.  Listen, stop chewing gum on the fucking air.  I'm sorry.  Chewing gum.  Just put a dick in your mouth.  He quit smoking years ago, but won't stop chewing the nicotine.  What are you, a little snitch? 
[02:28:00]  Sorry.  I want to keep people up on what's going on.  What else does he do?  Rich Boss once gave a drug dealer a blowjob to get a better deal on cocaine.  That's right.  He was a pharmacist.  Anthony would snitch on you.  If Anthony was in jail, he'd fucking be a little snitch.  He'd have all kinds of little...  He'd have all cool shit in his fucking room from his cage.  Do you think he'd have any emeralds?  I'd either have a dick in my ass on night one or I'd have swastika tattoos.  Why do they have to protect myself?  Why do you think those things are mutually exclusive? 
[02:28:30]  The tattoos would have happened before you went to jail.  Let's be honest.  I know.  You know, I like keeping them wearing the shirt covers so I can get to work.  If you go into prison, you get crosses put on your body because they won't stab you where  a cross is.  So you'd only have to get like 4,000.  I love that.  You know about prison.  That's an amazing fact.  I was reading prison stories the other night.  I caught the fat joke that didn't wash.  Believe me, if they want to cut your throat, they'll cut your throat through a cross.  Don't be naive.  Don't fucking act like you know everything.  There's fucking etiquette in prison. 
[02:29:00]  First of all, really?  The fact that you got etiquette out, I'm impressed with.  There's etiquette in prison.  I was talking to a guy.  He meant to say education, but...  Prison etiquette sounds like a Fox sitcom in the mid-80s.  Like right after Married with Children, prison etiquette.  Prison etiquette.  Out of all of us in this room, the people who would make it, it would go probably me,  Voss.  Yeah.  Probably.  That's it. 
[02:29:30]  It's over.  I need weaponry.  These three would be in the yard fucking cheerleading the basketball team.  You go.  You go.  We'd have make-sick wings on.  I'd have lipstick made out of M&M's and eye shadow as well.  Because you already know how to do it.  Listen to them.  Oh, yeah.  I used to work at Stuff Magazine.  We'd get letters from them.  They have these beautiful, ornate pictures they'd do.  And we'd be like, how do they get...  We'd go get back and forth with some of them. 
[02:30:00]  How'd you get the colors to make this beautiful picture?  Oh, we use the colors of M&M's and various candies.  Yeah, they're all like MacGyver's.  Have you heard of Fifi?  No.  You know what Fifi is?  This is a makeshift prison vagina.  And what it is, is it's the old toilet paper, cardboard holes, plastic surgical glove, and  you just put cream in there of Fifi.  Oh, man.  That is their own vagina.  Wait, hang on.  Bobby had a lame slam of me.  It wasn't actually a slam of you, insecure fucking round-eye. 
[02:30:30]  I don't like fucking Rango face.  Fucking Andy eats flies on the red axis.  No, I was going to say that.  I'm so going to steal that tonight.  You'd be the only guy.  Uncle Fester's making fun of my lungs.  Leave his surprise face alone. 
[02:31:00]  He's only kidding, Amon Gert.  Jesus Christ.  Now, what was your slam?  It wasn't a slam.  I was going to say that Andy would be the only one in the prison yard who would be mad that  he had to do this.  The other two would be like, yay.  But it was, I stopped.  Oh, right.  I got you.  It was a compliment to me.  Scrimshaw.  Well, Jim and I would be really enthusiastic cheerleaders, but Andy would still have the  dead eyes while he's cheering.  Bill would be mad at us.  I don't want to do this.  Well, I would be out of the team leader. 
[02:31:30]  That's what Bobby just said, only funny.  I didn't say it.  And then insecure Levy had to get it out of me.  Levy, I just saw a ghost.  Man.  Oh, what?  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  Let's just cloud into a wall right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Let's get caught up on our breakage.  Oh, my gosh.  And we'll be back, and I guess maybe talk about something with just an iota of substance.  Perhaps.  That's right. 
[02:32:00]  The penthouse girl we have coming in.  Yes, we have her coming in, too.  There's a penthouse girl.  The penthouse girl?  Picked a good day.  I comb my hair.  I'm so happy.  I'm going to be at Uncle Vinny's Friday night.  Who cares?  And today, true, today, Boston Wilbur Theater presale went on for my show at the Wilbur in  Boston, the code word dude at Ticketmaster for Wilbur and the chickpea.  When is the show, though?  It's in January.  It's pre-sale for today.  Today it ends.  For now for January?  What's that? 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, just pre-sale today.  Just pre-sale.  You should have a date, though.  You should get the dates.  People could know when they're fucking going.  Yeah, well, this show used to fucking have a piece of paper with all your shit.  There'd be people that did stuff.  You're supposed to know your fucking shit.  No shit.  That's my whole thing.  I got one piece of paper.  For now, Sam came in with one piece of paper.  Usually there's different, there's fucking dossiers for everyone on the show.  Not me.  I'm like, give me one piece of paper with names.  Look at this.  It's perfect.  Bob Kelly, tomorrow night, Uncle Vinny's, Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey, Uncle Vinny's

You gotta know that I'm at Governor's.  And, listen, if you ever have to choose you.  Sag.  Yeah, you'd be performing through a hole in the wall.  If you do the password for Bob's show, Digging for Gems, they'll charge you extra.  They will charge you extra.  Double the price.  You get a free bucket of dirt.  There's a two bucket minimum.

[02:34:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show  And with little Jim  Come here for a second  Can you ask him what I'm not doing?  I'm not drinking my coffee right now  I'm not drinking my coffee  Only ordered it ten minutes ago  Bill Schultz asked my coffee  I'll tell you what else you're not doing  I'm thinking of a vagina  I ordered it black  But I know there's going to be spit in it 
[02:35:00]  But I'll drink it anyway  Bill actually  Bill gets fucking chicks man  Oh it's crazy  Don't be a favor  Don't analyze my joke  I was just kidding Bill  Yeah I know  But I'm actually  It brought up the fact  And it'd come in a bucket  Don't please  Wow  No DNA please  No DNA  Wow  That was the sweaty  Sweaty  Greasy  Hand on a  Rusted brake handle  I didn't even hear what the brake entailed  I'm just enjoying my coffee  It didn't work  So I'm going to move on 
[02:35:30]  Vos did the equivalent  No  No  When it doesn't work  You don't move on  You don't move on  I'm going to show you on  Spotlight on the air  What the fucking show do you think you're doing here  Vos did the equivalent of like  A woman showing her baby  And he just dropped a brick  On the front of his face  I wanted to talk to Andy  Because Andy's been involved in  You are just a Twitter troublemaker  I am  Lately  I am  And of course  You're beating  And taking on rap stars  Which 
[02:36:00]  That's badass  Always healthy  Badass  You're  Although from the safety of my living room  Not that bad  Well true  You know  You're in a gated community  I'm sure  Although in Andy's defense  His Twitter address  Actually says Andy Levy  Instead of like  Sofa Killer 2  Like people know exactly who he is  They know who he is  Although they will say  I've never heard of you before  Right  That's always a good bash  Yeah  When people  They want to try to get at you  It's like  I don't even know who you are 
[02:36:30]  They get all mad at you  The best is  I get all these ones from like  Chris has 4 million Twitter followers  You only have 50,000  So you don't mean anything  And I look like  This person has 7 followers  Yeah  So what are you saying about yourself there?  No actually  This does speak badly of Andy  Because he looked  I hate this guy  7 followers  F you  Because I think it's  Like anytime  The dumbest thing in the world  Is sitting next to me  Vons just look both ways 
[02:37:00]  You stupid  So can he  So can he  It's called revolve  It's called breaching  The baby just had another brick land on him  To the choir or something  Right Bob?  I hate Chip  Go Chip  So you had a fight with a little brawl on Twitter with Chris Brown  With Chris Brown  Yeah  Yeah  I have no idea how that started 
[02:37:30]  It was your own smart ass remark  Is that what it was?  Yeah maybe it was  It was hilarious  You were being snarky  You were being very snarky  It definitely alluded to his punching his girlfriend in the face  Yeah  Well tell them the original line  It was about planking right?  Yeah  Yeah  Whatever  He said something like  You know  I'm not planking on a woman anymore  Unless  I'm not planking anymore  I'm not planking on a beautiful woman  Unless it's on a beautiful woman  LOL  Yeah 
[02:38:00]  Which is always my favorite thing  Don't put LOL on your own tweets  Yeah  You're not laughing at your own shit  Stop it  What's planking?  Planking is just  What they did to your teeth  Something you can't  Something you can't walk on  Just tip the tack  Two solid smashes  That was a draw  It's what Voss thinks whales eat  Planking is 
[02:38:30]  Planking is  You go down to North Carolina  And they give you a thing of wood  And you look on the wood  This is some good lumber  Yeah  It's this stupid craze  That people are doing  Where you lie down  I don't care  Like a plank  You ask  Motherfucker  I don't  You lay down  And they take a picture  Pretend you're a plank  And they take a picture  And people take pictures 
[02:39:00]  And post it online  That's it  But it's supposed to be  In a weird spot  But people are doing it  People are dying  Because they're planking on ledges  And falling off  Yeah  Seriously  So let's say  Somebody goes outside  That's called splatting  And you find a cab  Stopped at a light  And you climb up on top  And just lay there stiff  On top  And someone takes a picture  Has anybody ever planked on you?  No  No  They planked after being on him  Oh I've seen that  Okay I get it  It's fucking ridiculous  It's dumb  Any picture where they're standing  Straight like that 
[02:39:30]  White kids invented that  It had to be white kids  Norton does it on tranny dick  Wow  This fucking baby's getting killed  Wow  Wow  So Andy  That actually sucked the air  I couldn't breathe  Andy's eyes got wider  Your eyes always looked like Arnold's  When the fucking roof came off  In total recall  Alright go ahead  So Andy wrote  You misspelled punching 
[02:40:00]  Yes  Thank you for getting his back on focus  By the way  I tried  It's very hard  That was impressive  Six of us in here  So then  I guess his posse  Well so first  I got  It started getting retweeted  By some people  I've done this with Chris Brown  Before and other celebrities  And there's other people  Eli Braden  And Jenny Johnson  On Twitter  Both do this with celebrities  All the time  It's like with the Kardashians  Whatever  It's really funny  So I did it 
[02:40:30]  It got retweeted  A bunch  But then all of a sudden  I did it right before  We taped the show  At work  And then I got home  A couple hours later  And I  I used this  Twitter program  That shows you  Like when new people  Are following you  It pops up  And all of a sudden  It started going crazy  I was like  What the hell happened  So I went and looked  Norm MacDonald  Retweeted my tweet  Oh okay  And that's what made it  Take off  That's a big one  It just took off  From there  And started going nuts  And then everyone  Was retweeting it  And then Chris Brown's fans  Team Breezy  Team Breezy yo

[03:26:00]  Sirius XR  Hey, hey, hey  And now  The Opie and Anthony Show  Continues  Continues  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Wow  Oh wow  What a packed show  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  There's a  Come on in  Mashup  There's a mashup  Walking by  Don't worry  Opie's on vacay  Rich, I told this to Nicole  What happened?  Opie has said before 
[03:26:30]  He's not a big fan  Of the morning mashup  On the after show  Well, heck you Opie  He's on vacation  It's okay  And the hurricane's headed towards him  You know, he says that on the air  And then when he sees me in the holes  He's so nice  Oh, hey Nicole  Hey, so how's your dog  Oh, how's Matt  Oh, hey  He doesn't think you're a bad person  And he thinks you guys do fine on the mashup  He just doesn't like a sign  He's not a fan of you guys on the after show  Yeah  It's the Opie and Anthony crowd  He doesn't like you  Hey Opie, you can suck it  You miss it  Because Rich does Covino and Rich right after the morning mashup  Like he's got a lot of stuff going on  Whereas the morning mashup goes into their office 
[03:27:00]  The other day  You should have seen  Nicole was in a bad mood  Because she was fighting with her fiance  And I think I said three words  And all of a sudden  I start World War III  Between Stan and Nicole  What'd you say?  I don't remember this  You don't remember fighting  And kicking me out of your office  Oh, and I walked by  And she said, fuck off  And you screamed at Roland  Wait, but what was it?  What was the fight about?  Do you remember?  Or you don't even remember?  It was about  Oh, because you said  Stan does nothing for your show  For the mashup  You said Stan talks about 
[03:27:30]  That's right  You said that Stan comes in  Does the show  And then sits around  And talks to his mom  On the phone all day  He talks to his mom  And he goes on Facebook and stuff  You said Stan  From the morning mashup  From your show  Comes in  And he tells you guys  About all these ideas he has  And then after the show  He sits in the office  Doing nothing  But looking up pictures  That's 100% right  From the Philly days in 1991  That is correct  That is 100% correct  Yo, I got big dreams  I just don't want to execute them  Yeah  Yeah, dude  So you must have been instigating 
[03:28:00]  And, you know  Stirring the pot  As you do, Stan  No, but you were in a bad mood  Because you were fighting  With your fiancee, Matt Ryan  Well, you shouldn't fuck with me  When I'm in a bad mood  And then all of a sudden  I go  Oh, you see  Nicole is fighting  With her boyfriend  Instead of  And then you start  Just flipping out on Stan  And kicked me out of the office  I apologize  And this screened at me too  I might have been  You should apologize to Stan  No, he's already out of here  I don't care  I'm over it  He's gone?  Yeah, he left  Stan's going to get a finger  In his ass today  For the first time  He is  He's going to get  His prostate checked  He's very nasty 
[03:28:30]  Or that's what he tells you  He's very nervous  And nasty  All die  Are you guys in trouble?  Your boss is walking up the hall  Fuck  There's Kid Kelly  Nah, I don't care  You don't care, right?  I don't give a shit  Well, you got the backup gig, though  There's Kid  Well, because  Kid's pointing in here like  What are they doing?  Hey  Hey, it's Kid Kelly  He wants to go have breakfast  Is what it comes down to  It's time for breakfast  He's saying he's nuts  Love you, though  And, oh, by the way  Do you think this storm is for real or no?  Kid Kelly on the radio  Hello, everybody  We're on the air  Afternoons on Hits 1, 5 to 9  Thank you very much 
[03:29:00]  There he is  Kid Kelly, Afternoons, 5 to 9  I'd like to thank Steve  For making me everything I am today  Who's Steve?  Different story  If he's listening, he knows  Okay, I hope he is listening  The rest of the world is  Well, Rich, Nicole  All right, later, bud  Thank you for stopping by  Whoever has a finger in Stan's ass  Yeah, Stan's getting a finger in his ass, I heard  I don't know anything about  I don't know anything about that  Uh-huh  But is it wrong to say FRZ?  I gotta go  FRZ  I don't know what that means, either  Oh, I know what that means!  I know what that means!  I figured it out!  Kid Kelly, everybody! 
[03:29:30]  Kid Kelly makes an impact!  Roland, that had to make your day  I know what he's talking about!  Kid Kelly makes an impact!  Well  Listen, you all may not know what that means at home  He's my new God  But what I want you  It's in reference to something that's in reference  If you can figure out what that means  You're an intelligent person  Who probably knows more about Sirius XM than you should  And if you can't figure out what that means  You're in the majority  So don't worry about it 
[03:30:00]  Kid Kelly, Nicole Rich Davis from the morning mashup  Make an early impact here on the after show  Um  There's a packed show, Roland  Yeah, it was  Packing these guests in  And making phenomenal shows  I might add  Yeah, getting guests approved  I mean, do you realize  When Ant was on the air  Talking about wanting to move to Texas  That was today  That feels like two weeks ago  So much has happened since  Yeah  That was this morning  Wow  And the replay's on, of course, at 3pm  I mean, the show starts good 
[03:30:30]  It ends good  It's good in the middle  But what else could you expect from the Opie and Anthony show  What I liked  I liked the combining of comics that we've been doing all week  And I mean, I think today illustrated that perfectly  How much potential that has  Because the second hour of the show  Rich Voss is getting smashed for his inability  To make a story about his house burning down interesting  About Killian almost died  And he gets smashed  To smithereens  To smithereens  Rich Voss is getting destroyed 
[03:31:00]  We go to commercial break  We come back with Bob Kelly  Talking about digging for rocks  And Bob Kelly now  Gets destroyed  The whole thing turns around  And it's a beautiful thing  When we can get synergy like that  Paul's in here  Are you happy to be  Paul, if you don't remember  We talked to him a couple days ago  He's our former intern  Who's, since we're short-staffed this week  No Opie  Danny and Derek are on vacation  Now, Coke Logic  Coke Logic  Yes, Roland  Did you not notice?  I didn't notice  Okay, well, Coke Logic tweeted me 
[03:31:30]  And I love the little digs  That are getting in on this after show today  Little, tiny little digs  All over the place  I just read the poses  You passed to me, baby  And they're all sort of like  That's not what I meant by that  No, you can't take that personally  But that's what I live for  I said no Danny today  Everybody's happy  Coke Logic tweeted  Oh my god, Roland  You're starting to move away  From the little digs  To the giant  This is what I'm saying  Literally  Yeah, jabbing out  Good point, Paul  I kid, I kid  Because I care  Or 
[03:32:00]  Love  Are you sure?  Yes  Okay, I'll take your word for it  Coke Logic tweeted me, though  And saying  Are Danny and Derek  On vacation together?  Because we talked about  Earlier in the week  Opie and Anthony  Not taking vacations together  And that doesn't mean  That they don't  That doesn't mean  That they hate each other  It means that  They're two grown men  They don't take vacations together  They work together  They're not going to vacation together  Roland  Are Danny and Derek  Vacationing together? 
[03:32:30]  Um  I'm not sure we should say  Is it private life?  Iraq?  Are they together?  I didn't know  They were on vacation  You didn't realize either  Until Roland just told me  I didn't know  Okay, well  Then we're going to move on  From this completely  Before people  Bury themselves  Without realizing it  Because listen  Danny and Derek  May be on vacation  This week  But they're coming back  You will have to deal  Of course  But I'll say it  Because I won't have to deal with them  Yes, they're on vacation together  They are  Yes  They're probably  Roland  They're probably not listening 
[03:33:00]  To this right now  So don't worry about it  They're probably still sleeping  Since they're on the west coast  Paul  Together  Both of them are on the west coast  I said too much  Paul  Are you happy to be back  Into the swing of things  Or  Here's  Because here's  When I was an intern  It was all good  June  It was the summer, right?  So June was awesome  July was fantastic  But then it was just like  Summer vacation for school  August starts to creep around  And the dates left  On your internship 
[03:33:30]  Like the weeks that are left  Now you can start counting them  Now it's three weeks  Like that's a feasible amount of time  It's not like it's a month and a half  It's literally  This week  Then next week  Then the next one  Then this whole thing ends  And then two weeks  And then I mean  It's a horribly depressing time  For an intern  After living through  Well you didn't really  Live through that yourself  You just kind of petered out  Until they literally  Threw you out of the building  And said you can't come back  But  This is like a mini version  Of that this week  Even though  You're not an intern 
[03:34:00]  You're a  As you said  Freelance producer  For the Opie and Anthony show  Again you said that  No one else  But  You said that  Now that it's  Today's Wednesday or Thursday  Today's Thursday  Oh my god  Thanks the lord  Suits tonight on the USA Network  Thanks for the plug  I love suits  I love that show  Okay good to know  Since today's Thursday  Now we're at the  Sort of end of the week  Mark one day left  Are you feeling it?  Yeah  Like you're gonna have to  Go back to just being  A part time board op 
[03:34:30]  You're not gonna be  Part of the show anymore  Working my own gig  And yeah  What's been your favorite  Memory this week so far?  Still meeting Roland  Oh you hadn't met Roland  I totally  I keep forgetting  Also  I was snoring  When I was taking a little nap  Where?  In the office  I was tired  What time?  Wait Paul only works  During the show  Yeah  So what time was it?  I don't know  I get a little tired  Okay fair enough  It's early in the morning  What can people expect  I was snoring  And he didn't take a picture  Or tape me so  You didn't?  Actually no I did 
[03:35:00]  Oh  I absolutely did  You just didn't know  Just because nobody  Shows you the picture  Don't assume that  There was no picture taken  Well I told Travis about it  And then he said  Yeah we all have those pictures  Don't act like it's snow  I mean I've got like  Multiple videos on my phone  Of Roland sleeping  Yeah and unfortunately  It's due to my low blood sugar  It's not funny  But it's a disease  It is  Or is that something  You made up  Because last time you said  You fell asleep  Because you were praying  Well I pray  Because of my low blood sugar  I hope it heals  You just lie  You're just making jokes up  Because you're sleeping 
[03:35:30]  Well according to WebMD  Gotcha  It's a disease  Well it's important  To self diagnose  Bob Kelly's story  Did you hear it about  Digging through the dirt  In the bucket?  Like it was insane  Like I love  That he'll be a rich man  That Bobby came on here  And he acted as if  He was breaking the story  That this is a scam  Like this sounded like  When I was seven  I went to Legoland  And they let you  There's like an old western part  Of Legoland  And you can pan for gold 
[03:36:00]  And then the little scraps  Of gold you find  You give to the attendant  And they put them in a press  And then you get a gold medal out  And like when I was seven  I got it  And I said  Well this is obviously  A plastic gold medal  It didn't come from  What I just took out of that  You know  Scraping bin  And that was when I was seven  Like wouldn't you realize  Like they didn't just  Bucket up dirt  With rock  Like they  That's set up for tourists  Yeah  I was in Disney World  A couple of weeks ago  And they had the same thing 
[03:36:30]  Only with dinosaur fossils  And literally  I was wandering around the park  Kind of after hours  So all the kids  Had obviously gone home  And you'd see the guys  With buckets of fossils  Yeah  Throwing them out on the ground  And then kicking some dirt over them  And walking away  See like the kids  Would think  Oh I'm digging  But a man of Bob Kelly's age  With his life experience  Shouldn't be that  Malleable  To say  You know  Yeah this is real  You can find diamonds  In this bucket  If there any  Whatever  Eric  Did you ever 
[03:37:00]  Go to Legoland  Or Disney World  I know you're a Florida guy  A theme park guy  Florida resident  No  Rob  Rob Cross  Had to take the brunt  Of Eric  Because Eric  I was in Rob Cross' office  And I forget  Rob ended up asking him  Rob Cross is our boss  And he ended up asking him  About  Something that came up  On the show  I don't know  And Eric just went into  A tirade  Yelling about me  And accusing me  Of taking  Small kernels  What?  Of half truths 
[03:37:30]  And weaving  And developing  These massive  Stories  Full of details  That I make up  In my head  Is that true Eric?  I disagree  I don't make up  I don't make things up  Like this  He's gone  Where'd he go?  I see his hand  I think his  Oh he's got  He's got the one finger up  Oh I think he has  A muffin in his hand  Oh is he having breakfast?  If he's on the phone  He's really supposed to be  Answering the phone  On the air  I told him when  The office phone rings  Oh who's he  Maybe he's on the phone  With his dentist  Oh yeah 
[03:38:00]  Who was he  Your dentist?  Who's on the phone?  What?  Was he your dentist?  Oh no it was Norton  Oh okay  I had to take a call  But I was telling them  How you went into  A tirade in Rob Cross's office  Accusing me of making up  Stories based on  Half truths about you  Yeah you do that  All the time  Well I don't  Roland you tell me  The stories that I've told  About Eric Nagel  True or false?  It's like the stories  About me  Sometimes I want to hear  On the air  But you tell the truth  That's right  That's 100% true  It's 100% true  It's like the jewels 
[03:38:30]  That Bob was finding  You know they're right there  But then Sam puts on  The coating and the coating  And coating  And make it this big clump  That oh you found something  So you're telling me  So you're telling me  That the listeners  Believe that they have  Uncovered all these truths  About Eric Nagel  Not realizing  Who's Eric?  Prince Nagel  Sex bagel  Not realizing that  Just a few minutes ago  I put the jewels  In the bucket myself  Exactly  That these truths  Are not found  The things that I've planted  That's not Eric  That's insane  And ridiculous  Seven years 
[03:39:00]  People listening to this show  Thought I was from Florida  You're from Florida  Until we had the discussion  On the after show  That I'm not from Florida  Eric gets pissed  He is going to Florida  Yeah where are you  Vacationing next week?  In the Caribbean  But where you have to  Fly to first  I have to fly to Florida  Where are you having dinner  When you get to Florida?  What?  Where are you having dinner  When you get to Florida?  I don't know  How many days are you  Spending in Florida  Before you go to  No I'm not going  To where you think  I'm going  Where are you going?  You think I'm going  To Cracker Barrel 
[03:39:30]  Or something like that  I wasn't even going to say  Actually it is delicious  I know Cracker Barrel  Is your favorite restaurant  The Chick-fil-Dumplines  Alright where are you staying  When you're in Florida  Waiting for the ship  To go?  For the first night  I'm staying at my folks house  Okay your folks house  Your parents  Who live in  West Palm Beach  And that is in the state of  Where the fuck  Are you going with this?  What state is West Palm in?  That would be in Florida  Sam  Your hometown  Eric  Of course you're staying  At your parents house  In Florida  Eric just gets so pissed off 
[03:40:00]  Because it's like  He says  I grew up on Long Island  That's not true  That is true  He says that I make up a lie  22 years on Long Island  That's complete bullshit  No  Nobody's ever seen you  On Long Island  Nobody knows who you are  You're a ghost  People  He says that I make up  Little things  Like I make these lies up  And I just keep repeating  And repeating  And repeating  Until everyone around here  Assumes they must be trues  But why would I lie about  Eric being from Florida  I just don't understand  Because you're a dick  I'm not a dick  You're a dick 
[03:40:30]  Take that back  No  Are we going to celebrate  Troy's birthday today?  I tried to but  Where's Troy's like a fart on him?  Nobody wanted to acknowledge  His birthday today  What do you mean you tried to?  I tried to  I thought maybe we'd do  Something on air  Or  Who'd you try to do it with?  With Alexis Ford  What happened?  I was told that  She might want to  Entertain Troy  For his birthday  And nothing happened  Well who did you tell about it?  I told everybody  Well I mean  I guess there were  Seven comics in the room 
[03:41:00]  At the time  It's a little hard to  Pull anything off  But Troy there was  Some thought  Listen I did want to play  We couldn't get him a cake  So that was the next best thing  Well I mean I know  He does enjoy a lunch  Every now and then  Oh yeah  We'll take him to Wendy's  Maybe that's something  You could consider Eric  Eric's buying?  I think so  For Troy yes  Everyone else  Go fuck themselves  I'm kind of hungry  Let's get breakfast this morning  Listen  We were talking about  Bob Kelly's vacation  Real quick  And we'll get back to  Troy and all that  But I wanted to play  Bob  Oh it's Norton again  Okay now I want to know 
[03:41:30]  What Norton's calling about  Because this is the second time  Eric has had to leave the board  To take a phone call  And I would like to know  What is going on?  Did you hear Mick Foley  On the after show yesterday?  I only caught part of it  Because I was walking to my car  I was upset  I missed the second half of it  He made all kinds of  Wrestling blogs overnight  It was amazing  Seeing Mick Foley  And I'll tell you this  He opened up too to you  He did open up  He was very  Well he and I  Have a bit of a relationship now  And I will tell you this  Mick Foley  Got his start in comedy 
[03:42:00]  Through O&A  Because his first comedy gig  As he talked about yesterday  Was doing five minutes  At the Traveling Virus tour  And getting basically  Booed off stage  Which I explained to him  Yeah it happens  To the best of us  Us as if I've ever  Performed in front of that  Many people  Weren't you part of  The staff  There's a difference  Between the Hard Rock  And the PNC Bank Arts Center  Good point  But yes Paul  Mick  We got to see Mick develop  Through O&A  Meanwhile 
[03:42:30]  I feel like  When I really started developing  I mean  Now I'm a  You know  Host of the after show  Eric  That is disgusting  You think that was necessary?  This is a meeting call  Oh I see  Yeah  Roland responded  You guys hooking up?  Maybe  When I  We're both running green  I think the breakout moment  For Sam Roberts  Was when Mick Foley  Fed me steak  I feel like Mick and Sam Roberts  Are growing  On parallel levels 
[03:43:00]  I feel like we're  Kindred spirits  In that sense  Don't you think so Roland?  Yeah you're like  The Barbara Walters  Of wrestling interviews  They open up to you  That's right  They cry  They open up  That's right  I get to see  A sense of  Of their soul  You're like  Tell me what's really wrong  Let me tell you Sam  Anyway Eric  Is Norton okay?  Was that Norton again?  No not the second time  No  What was the second time?  Your dentist?  Yeah  That was for me  He dropped an eagle  Who did?  Eric  Yeah I'll get to that 
[03:43:30]  In a second  I'll fucking punch you  You can't put your chin  Up to the glass  And expect Eric  To punch through the glass  To your chin  That's not  That's not ballsy  Do you see why  Roland is my favorite  Part of the week  By the way  Roland is most people's  Favorite part of the week  Even on  I got a tweet yesterday  From I can't remember  His twitter name  Unfortunately  He said  I have become  A giant Roland fan  Because of the after show  Oh  Because it lets Roland  You know  The personality  Comes out a little more  He's hanging  And he's gonna be  Hanging with us  A little longer  We were talking about 
[03:44:00]  Bob Kelly  Panning for gems  And going through  His gem bucket  Earlier on the show today  He's a weird guy  Bob Kelly  Because he just  He goes  Full force  On these vacations  You know where I'm going  Eric  You know where I'm going  With this  No  I'm looking here  I don't have my sheet  With me  Okay well  Let's see  I'm gonna see  If while I'm saying this  You know where I'm going  And just to see  If you don't  It's not a big deal  He loves his vacations  And he goes full force  He's an addict in that way 
[03:44:30]  Jim has said it before  That he's an addict in that way  That whatever his hobby  Of the moment is  He's full force on it  And he's a sportsman  And he's done that  On vacation as well  And of course  By sportsman  I mean a fly fisherman  Bob Kelly  And he's taken Opie with him  I don't know if you knew that Paul  Yeah  Because that was after your time  And then we said  Street hotels  They stayed at a horrible hotel  By the way  Thoughts and prayers  With Opie  As he's trying to survive  The hurricane out there  He's already 
[03:45:00]  I'm praying for it not to hit  This may be the apocalypse  Because he's already  If you're following Opie's Twitter  Opie Radio  He's seeing dead horses  On the beach  Jesus  He's seeing horses  Lying dead  At the shore  Isn't this the second year  In a row by the way  That this is happening  That a hurricane  Yeah  Listen  New York's getting hit  By earthquakes  Opie's feeling earthquakes  There's a hurricane predicted  Horses dying at the beach  Opie  I'm not saying  That you carry bad karma  But this is not good 
[03:45:30]  Whatever's going on there  It's not good  And for the residents  Of the Outer Banks  I would suggest  That you evacuate immediately  Just to save everybody else  Because  Didn't he also post  That in order to remove  The horse that wasn't moving  That a tow truck  Had to drag it off the beach  Horses are giant creatures  That's why you don't see them  Washed up at the beach  Very often  I mean there are wild horses  Of course on the Outer Banks  But I mean for  A dead horse to be  At the shore of the beach  While all these families  Are coming  I like the photo  It's an insane thing  If you haven't seen the photo 
[03:46:00]  It's up on Opie Radio  On Twitter  But it's just  The horse is laying there  While other horses  Are just standing around  Just staring at it  Well the other horses  Are thinking the same thing  That us people are thinking  How the fuck did a dead horse  End up at the shore  Of the beach  Like I understand whales  Or trout  Or crabs  But there's a giant horse  On the shore  Like it'd be one thing  If there was a dead horse  Who's ever seen  A dead horse before  Horses are supposed  To kind of die  In some tucked away  Remote place  That nobody's ever seen 
[03:46:30]  You don't stumble  Upon a dead horse  Or by a shotgun  Yes  Hunted  I could understand  I don't get it  Because nobody eats horse meat  So it doesn't make any sense  To me  After the race  If they lose the race  They shoot them  If they lose  I don't think they  If they're injured  They might shoot them  But I don't think  Just losing a race  Will cause a horse  To be  In the Bikes Bunny cartoon  After every horse  They die  And that's why  They fight so hard to win  I guess  Because they know  Their life is on the line  It's not at the glue factory  Yeah  But who  Yeah they go to the glue factory  They don't end up  As a dead horse body  On the shore  There's starfish  And stuff there 
[03:47:00]  It's a giant horse  It looked like  It had come out of the water  Like it looked like  A beached whale  Did it look drowned  Like it was  In the shoreline  It was just  It was a horse's dead body  Like a beach  Lying on the beach  You should go Paul  When you get a chance  When you get in front of a computer  Go to Opie's Twitter  Opie Radio  Because you gotta see  Pictures of this horse  But Opie  He went fly fishing  With Bob Kelly  And as much  It's all I was thinking  When Bob Kelly  Was talking about  You know  Panning through the dirt 
[03:47:30]  Trying to find his gems  I just thought about  How full force he was  Behind fly fishing  Back like  Maybe  Two years ago or so  So this is just a taste  Of Bob Kelly  And his fly fishing  Troy the birthday boy  Will come up next  But Bob Kelly  And his fly fishing  Right now  On After Opie and Anthony Live  Oh I'm playing it I guess  Well who else is gonna play it  You threw a CD  Into the thing there  I thought you had something  I didn't throw any CD in there  Paul is my witness  Paul  I thought you were putting something  In the CD  No I didn't  But Eric 
[03:48:00]  I gotta hear that  You're producer extraordinaire  And I have every faith  That you do have it here  On After Opie and Anthony Live  After Opie and Anthony Live  How far is the fly fishing  From Ross  Right there  You walk in  Right there  Right there  You walk right into any river  Any river up there  You can stop  And just get  You walk into rivers like that  What  It's the clean  What are you acting like  It's not the Hudson  Cold and fucking  He doesn't like nature  I like a little nature  I don't wanna be in a river  Little nature  Why  You see wild animals  When you're fly fishing  Oh fuck dude  An otter  Came

[03:54:00]  Am I gonna know who it is  I don't know  I could even  I don't know where the dude went  Who is offering this guest up  So  Roland  I'll meet you in the hallway  And you can see if you can find her  If you want her  It's a her  Yeah  Okay  I think it's who I said  That was Rob Cross by the way  On the ones and twos  Everybody loves that melodic voice of his  FRC right  FRC indeed  Eric  Here's how you're gonna  Yeah  You're gonna have to make up that dead air to me  Sure  Here's what I need you to do  Uh huh  We'll talk about Troy in a minute 
[03:54:30]  Okay  But  We have  The after show tomorrow  Yeah  Then we're off until Labor Day  Right  Uh  Yeah we come back  I mean the day after Labor Day  I think it's the 6th  It's 6th  Well I'm gonna tell you this  You know what September 6th is  It's a very special day  The  Oh yeah  What is it Eric  It's your birthday  That's the day I was born  September 6th  You can clap Paul  You can clap  There you go  Now Eric  You can stop clapping 
[03:55:00]  Yes  Here's what I need you to do for me  Okay  Obviously we'll be here on September 6th  I feel like  The after show  Should be  A Sam Roberts birthday party that day  But  It's a little douchey  To throw your own birthday party  Now  Yes  The critics may say  It's even more douchey  To tell someone  To throw you a birthday party  Sure  I can accept that criticism  But that's where I'm going with this  But for your birthday  I'm gonna step it up  Hopefully  You are  Hey Rob  Can we expense stuff  For Sam's birthday 
[03:55:30]  On the 6th  September 6th  Sam owes me 80 bucks  You're not getting the 80 bucks  Cross  Why do you owe me 80 bucks  Because  Does someone from other staff  Oose you more money too  I had to buy  Don't you  I had to buy something  And then  Rob said  He would expense it for me  And just give me the cash  So I didn't have to stay  Without the cash  It was $80  So Rob gave me the $80 in cash  Then he gave me back the receipt  And said  Hey they won't let me expense this  Because it's in your name  So you have to expense it  And then give me the $80 back  And I told him 
[03:56:00]  These are things he needs to check  Ahead of time  Because the $80 is gone  Right  He's not getting the $80  So no he can't expense shit  For Sam's birthday  That's not fair  He's got 80 bucks  He can spend it on his own birthday  Eric talk to Gary about this  Don't talk to Rob about this  He's holding a personal vengeance  When it's supposed to be work related  Yeah this is not professional  Wait Sam  Are you Dr. Ian  Rob?  Dr. Ian-ing  Rob  Yes because we all know  What he did to Eric  No  Rob  You'll get your  Well I'll tell you what  If there's a fabulous birthday party 
[03:56:30]  Thrown for me  Then I'll consider giving you  The $80 back  But until  This is like a pyramid scheme  It's going to get sucked deeper  Down this rabbit hole  Of like doing things for you  Never get my 80 bucks  Hey real quick  The way you guys were talking about  Earlier about things  That you say about Eric  That everybody thinks is true  Like literally  Until yesterday  I thought Eric was a  Rich boat owner  From Florida  Who had stole lottery money  From you guys  Like that was his back story  And you're Eric's boss  Yeah that's what I thought  I thought I knew a lot about Eric 
[03:57:00]  And I thought that was it  Well I mean  Most of that is true  Just because he sold his boat  Doesn't mean he wasn't a boat owner  At one time  I still stand by  Granted  I wasn't there  When Eric stole the newspaper  I kind of thought Eric  Was like the thirst and howl  Of the ONA staff  Look don't get it twisted Rob  Just because some of the details  Are things I make up  For humor's sake  Doesn't mean all the details  Are wrong  Eric Nagel  Is loaded  Okay  The Nagel family  Is what it is  In Florida right now 
[03:57:30]  And the Nagel family  Does live in Florida  And Eric  I mean that's not  Insulting for me to say  Is it  You guys got  You guys got it like that  Just because  Troy  Me  Danny  You know we're speaking  Out of a place of jealousy  Out of how much  You make  You know what I mean  It's not like we're  I don't have a personal  Vendetta against you  I wish  I could have  A piece of the Nagel fortune  But that's just something  That I'm going to strive for  You know what I mean  Eric was never hungry  As a child  Well  Does he look like 
[03:58:00]  A hungry guy  There was always  Food on the table  You bet  Well not for long  There was always a feast  A smorgasbord  You got 80 bucks  Of my fortune  And I want it back  Well I want a fabulous  Birthday party  So fair is fair  You know what I mean  You give a little  You get a little  You say I'm asking  It'll happen  Fabulous birthday party  Done  Roland is the party starter  Now enough about me  Because today is somebody else  It's always about you  Well look  By the way  There was one wrestling website  That posted the Mick Foley clip  From yesterday  And Anthony  As soon as I came in 
[03:58:30]  Told me that he had seen  The link that I posted  Because I just got such a kick  The wrestling website says  Mick Foley  Who talked to Sam Roberts  On After Opie and Anthony Live  With Sam Roberts  Told Sam Roberts  That's like  I might as well have written  The article myself  There were so many  Sam Roberts mentions  It was a beautiful thing  It would have been embarrassing  To somebody who  Was a bit more humble  But not for me  Right  So Troy  Today  The reason I bring up birthdays  And what made me think  Of my birthday  Is that today is your birthday  It is  And immediately I think 
[03:59:00]  Oh it's my friend's birthday  Oh that makes me think  Of birthdays  Back to Sam Roberts  How many more days  Of your birthday  September 6th  So however many days  That is  That's exciting  Back to Troy  What are you doing  To celebrate  I'm here  Dick in the ass  That's it  Dick in the ass  Yeah I got a lot  Of work to do  Wow  Yeah  You don't seem happy  About it  Are you at the age now  Where it's starting to be like  Birthdays aren't fun anymore  Because let me tell you  I'll be 28  Approaching 30 quickly  And I feel like 
[03:59:30]  Birthdays after 30  Are kind of like  I wish these would stop happening  Yeah they're slightly depressing  I get a little depressed  Around my birthday  And I get a little depressed  Around New Years  I know a lady never tells  But do you mind telling us  34  34 years old  Yeah  Let me tell you something  But look at that  Let's just hair  You look great  Because there are guys  Around here  It gets harder and harder  Every year  Who will go nameless  Who look older than you  Look definitely  You're the worst for wear  You're taking care of yourself  Buddy  I try man  You're handsome  Wow  You're in shape  We both try  Well Roland  It's hard man  As you get older 
[04:00:00]  You know you eat a cheeseburger  And you just  You pay for it  You know  You feel it  And I know you love Wendy's  So there are no plans  For celebration  Not really  No  I'm doing  I'm working  And then I'm going down  To the Lower East Side  To do some studio stuff later  That's it  Just to hone your craft  Or what are you doing  In the  I'm actually working  On a project  With this guy  Who's  It should be  Should be pretty cool  More on the  Sort of mixtape DJ level  It's  It should be  Really interesting  It's like a  Weird live mashup  With DJ and live  Band stuff  It's a little  Weird to talk about yet 
[04:00:30]  But  You're on that  You're on that future shit  What's up Eric  No I was talking with Roland  About trying to find the guest  Yeah  I don't want to  Rub her in the bus  She's somewhere here  I don't know  She's around  If you don't need me  I'll run down the hall  Real quick to see if she's around  Yeah yeah yeah  It's hilarious  She's somewhere in the  If you want  I don't know  Look I mean  And this is what  I can't stand about  Human beings  On twitter  Not everybody  But there are a few  Who just don't get it  Like  There are people 
[04:01:00]  Who still say  Aren't you supposed  To be playing clips  If I were really  Supposed to be  Playing clips  Like if that weren't  Just a gag  Yeah  Would the program  Director of this station  Be coming in here  And saying  Hey do you want  To talk to a guest  Yeah  You know what I mean  Exactly  He when he was  When Rob Cross  Was just on the mic  He would have not been saying  This is what I think of Eric  He would have been saying  This is a clip  That you should be playing  Well you know what it is  I think sometimes  That people just believe  Whatever the hosts say  Even though they can't  Put two and two together  In their own head  Yeah  You know what I mean  Like this is what's going on 
[04:01:30]  It's just whatever was said  That is the law  I mean it's what I talk about  All the time  And Andy even brought it up  He's like  He sits there  And he says  Your show is a steaming  Pile of shit  This is what I was listening to  On it yesterday  Yeah  Like  They can't  But you know  Take into account  The ball busting  If it was really that bad  Would Ant be listening  And if Opie and Anthony  And Jim both said  We love the shit hour  It's great  Then everybody would be  Blowing up your Twitter  Great show today  That's how it works  I don't need it guys 
[04:02:00]  But you know what  The other day  This kind of blew up  In our face  Because Ant said  All you do is talk about  Wrestling on that show  And we're like  No that's not true  We talk  Do other things  And what happened yesterday  One hour of wrestling  Interview with Nick Foley  Now I'm getting text messages  From people who work  At the late show  With David Letterman  That say  Shouldn't you be playing clips  Real funny guys  I guess you guys  Are running some kind  Of comedy show over there  Well we're trying  To do our own show  So please stop interfering  After all  It's not the Stangles birthday  It's Troy's birthday  That's right  Damn it  You know  There's so 
[04:02:30]  Also  Mitch and Stangles  Bill Burr's on tonight  Bill Burr's on  The Letterman show tonight  Yeah  So everybody should tune in  Right right yeah  Yeah because Bill Burr  Was on the last two days  And he annihilated  On this show  He killed  I heard he killed  On Letterman too  And so yeah  He was excited  He came in here happy  And when a comic  Is happy about their performance  They have to have done well  Because they're not  Positive people  But Bill Burr  He'll be on  He'll be on Letterman  Tonight  Check local  It's on CBS  At 1130 I'm sure  There is  Did you get any presents  Or anything
