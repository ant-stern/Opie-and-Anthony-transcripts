<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opens with a montage highlighting its controversial nature, followed by Big A in studio, having just eaten an oyster.  The hosts boast about strong ratings from a new system while complaining about poor numbers on the older one.  A substantial portion of the show is dedicated to dissecting the surprising success of Elvis Duran's seemingly bland morning show on Z100, contrasting its pop music, fake prank calls, celebrity gossip ("The Sleaze"), and "Battle of the Babies" contest with their own edgier approach.  Callers share their confusion and opinions.  The hosts debate the authenticity of prank calls, song parodies, and the overall perceived blandness of Duran's show,  including a comedic misunderstanding about maxi-pad wings by a character named Froggy.

The conversation then shifts to the controversial Vanity Fair photo shoot of a 15-year-old Miley Cyrus, followed by a lengthy discussion about Reverend Jeremiah Wright's controversial statements and their potential impact on Barack Obama's presidential campaign.  Numerous callers offer varied opinions on Wright's actions and the media's role.  Obama's gun control policies are also debated.  This segment incorporates celebrity gossip with "Club Soda Kenny".

The release of Grand Theft Auto IV (GTA IV) is excitedly discussed.  Anthony reveals his contribution of an explicit drinking and driving jingle for a beer commercial in the game.  News clips highlighting criticism of the game's violence, particularly from a mother whose son was murdered, are played and contrasted with research suggesting young players distinguish between game violence and reality.  Laszlo, involved in GTA IV's production, calls in, providing details about the release and sales projections.  The hosts discuss the game's in-game television content, receive and discuss their copies of the game, and highlight the overwhelmingly positive reviews (mostly 10/10).  The segment also features frequent profanity and offensive language, particularly in the discussions surrounding Reverend Wright and GTA IV's content.  The show references Lazlo's attempts at beer smuggling.

Further mocking of Elvis Duran's show ensues, playing clips of its inoffensive celebrity gossip segment,  leading to more discussion about its surprisingly high ratings.  Other topics include a listener's "sex bagel" anecdote, a news story about a mentally disabled man and a police lampshade incident, and a story about a seven-year-old who stole and crashed his grandmother's SUV.  The segment uses crude language and humor to highlight the absurdity of these situations.

A significant portion focuses on a conflict between staff members Danny, Nick Carter (from 92.3 K-Rock), and a taxi driver, with audio clips and listener feedback played.  The hosts discuss Danny's anger and reactions.

The show then addresses a heated argument between unpaid staff members Tony and Pat Duffy, aspiring for paid positions.  Audio clips of their argument—filled with insults, accusations of laziness, references to defecation, and threats of physical violence—are played.  Sam (present in studio) and Than (attempting mediation) are involved. Tony threatens to quit if Duffy is hired.  Listener calls about the situation are taken before an interview with Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys.  The interview covers Yauch's documentary, the Beastie Boys' history, political activism, and his perspective on hip-hop. Opie then reacts furiously to an upcoming article calling him "Asshole of the Week," leading to further outbursts. The hosts acknowledge the intensity of the situation and promise further discussion of the Tony/Duffy conflict.

Finally, Opie angrily reacts to a Page Six article about a rumored sex tape involving his fiancée and Bam Margera.  He vehemently denies the tape's existence, blaming a disgruntled former employee, Chauncey, for spreading the false rumor.  Opie details Chauncey's alleged attempts to manipulate the situation, citing instances of the rumor being spread.  He describes a phone call where Chauncey allegedly attempted to alter a Penthouse interview about the origin of "Whip Them Out Wednesday."  Anthony offers support, and after this emotional outburst, the show moves to the "Line of the Day" segment, resuming normal banter, including attacks on Eric and Steve and thanking Lazlo for procuring GTA IV. Jim Norton also promotes a live show in Pittsburgh.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We got Big A in studio.  He's got the tongue scraper.  He just scraped down an oyster.  Iraq, get in there for a sniff of that sample.  Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you shut up?  Shut up! 
[00:01:00]  Shut up!  Shut the f*** up!  This is where entertainment is going.  Would you reenact baby diaper mustache and tippy-tombs underpants?  Sure.  Oh no, you wouldn't.  It's like the underpants were dyed brown.  Alright, open them up.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  I gotta go right to Steve on the phone here.  Hey Steve, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got?  What's Steve doing?  What's up?  What do you got for the show?  I'm not...  Alright.  Oh my god.  Yeah.  Thanks for the phone call, Steve.  Thank you.  Great first call.  Great first call.  He wanted to say that we had the most awesome show intro ever. 
[00:02:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Do we?  Really?  Well, some of the affiliates get to hear Ecstasy of Gold every morning just before we come  on the radio.  Yeah.  Stupid ratings, stupid ratings, stupid ratings, stupid ratings.  Ah.  Blech.  Something weird going on in this town.  Yeah, we're good with the newfangled rating system and then we're not good with the old  system. 
[00:02:30]  Well.  I don't know.  I just don't even get it and whatever.  We've always been about talking about what's going on in our lives and man, like late last  week, ratings came in.  That's going to be the new system that they're officially going to adopt in the fall, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't even know the month, but sometime in the fall, probably like four or five months  from now.  We did extremely well.  This radio station in New York City that is our flagship station did very, very well. 
[00:03:00]  Yep.  Everyone was very, very happy.  Yeah.  And then the old school ratings came out yesterday.  And it tells a much different story.  So what do you believe?  I tend to believe the newfangled ones.  Yeah, but no one's using the newfangled ones.  That's the problem.  It's the wave of the future.  That's the problem.  The wave of the future.  So David Hinckley reports that we took a drastic drop in the ratings. 
[00:03:30]  Ooh.  Wow.  And he has to rub it in by saying, what does he say?  This dummy.  Morning host, Opie and Anthony, who just signed a new contract, took a big drop.  But in the PPMs, we actually took a big jump up.  Yeah.  So, you know, who the hell?  What do you believe?  I don't care.  Just come in here and do this show.  Well, I care because I want to continue doing this.  For F sake.  So, I don't know. 
[00:04:00]  But I mean, you know, we have to at least throw it out there that it's a little weird  right now.  We were celebrating last week.  Today, we're feeling like crap because the ratings weren't that good.  That's how this business works.  But then if they adopt the new ratings, then we're going to be radio stars again.  But that's going to be four or five months from now.  He's just got to.  This business is just so whack, man.  You just got to deal with it.  And these dummies out there in radio land, and of course, I'm not talking the ones that  are hearing my voice right now because you've made the fine choice to listen to Opie 
[00:04:30]  and Anthony.  Anthony, they are listening to this guy, Elvis Duran, here in New York City.  He's on Z100.  He is destroying in the ratings.  Destroying.  How's that happen?  And he does nothing of significance with his radio show.  I mean, nothing.  He plays music, right?  I don't even.  He's not even on our radar.  Does he?  Iraq?  I can't even tell you.  He's not even on our radar.  It's like fluff. 
[00:05:00]  I mean, Z100 is a pop station.  He has those poppy hits.  Well, pop music right now is very, very hot.  And, you know, they explain every 10 years pop has a resurgence and becomes the thing.  And right now they're going through the thing where pop music is, is all the rage.  So I don't know if like people are tuning into Z100 in the mornings just to hear their favorite pop song because they can't possibly be tuning in to listen to this guy.  I mean, he's not controversial. 
[00:05:30]  He's not funny.  You know, apparently he's doing something.  What is he doing now?  Where's Sam?  Sam is kind of a young radio expert.  Maybe he could explain to us what this guy does in mornings.  Maybe we could adopt some of the things he's doing.  Do you know what Elvis Duran here in New York City does that he's killing so bad in the ratings?  Well, he plays a lot of great pop music.  So he does play a lot of music during the show?  A lot, yeah.  Oh, because the paper has his picture and everything. 
[00:06:00]  Like he is like the king of morning radio here in New York.  But those Z100 phone taps, I think, are what really gets the crowd moving.  What's a phone tap?  They put out these crazy prank calls that they like so much that they actually make promos out of them and air them.  First they air them on the Z Morning Zoo and then throughout the day we get highlights of today's phone taps.  But you can't, phone taps are illegal.  No, I know, they're crazy this show.  Don't the listeners understand?  They're crazy this show. 
[00:06:30]  Don't the listeners understand if you hear a brand new, because we play some of our old ones,  if you hear a brand new prank phone call on a radio show, it's staged.  It's fake.  You're not allowed to do them anymore.  Yeah.  So they're playing fake prank calls.  Do you understand?  We'd be doing the most heinous prank calls in the world.  We'd be calling up people and telling them loved ones are dead.  Well, we have in the past.  We did that one, yeah.  Yeah, we have in the past.  I was ready to say we wouldn't do that.  Well, of course we wouldn't now. 
[00:07:00]  Could you find out what else he's doing?  Because I just don't get it anymore.  I don't get it.  I mean, if it's prank phone calls, they're fake prank phone calls that these dummies are believing are real, I guess.  And the song parodies, too.  What?  They do song parodies.  Like what?  Well, they're like the Scott and Todd song parodies, only a little younger.  What?  Could you get me a Z100 song parody, please?  Yeah, we need an example of a song parody.  Look, he's getting a lot of attention here in New York today, so he got our attention. 
[00:07:30]  I swear to God, he wasn't even on our radar.  Because how do you compete against something like that?  Just playing pop tunes and fake prank phone calls.  I mean, we actually try to get something done with our show every day.  We try to make you laugh.  We try to entertain you.  We try to be a little shocking.  We try to be a little edgy.  Maybe we should just play pop songs.  That might do it.  Let's say hi to Rob. 
[00:08:00]  Rob, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Good.  All right.  This guy, Elvis Duran, man, my girl listens to him every morning.  Yeah.  And I listen to you guys.  Got the XM package.  And we get home from work.  I tell her what you guys did.  And we're cracking up.  I'm telling her stories you guys do.  And she told me what Elvis Duran did that day.  And this guy's the biggest square in radio.  Square.  That's a good one.  He's a square. 
[00:08:30]  Exactly what he is.  He's a square.  That's going to make me laugh all morning, Rob.  Elvis Duran is a huge square.  He's a square, man.  Strictly squaresville.  Can I ask all you guys something?  Let's say the radio gods came down and had a little meeting with us.  They said if you guys would turn into squares, you'll be number one in radio across the lawn.  Uh-huh.  Would you become a square? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, in a second.  No, you wouldn't.  Who wants to be known as a square?  And then they have something called celebrity sleaze.  What's that about, E-Rock?  That sounds edgy.  They have their own Access Hollywood-style reporter on their show who goes out and does celebrity interviews at hotels and conventions and all the hot spots in New York.  And she has her own little segment that she does, I think, twice in the show.  All right.  So we need someone doing celebrity gossip. 
[00:09:30]  Who on staff could do celebrity gossip?  We're going to copy his show today.  Who wants to do celebrity sleaze?  I know.  We're trashing him.  And all of a sudden, we're realizing, wow, he actually has bits that he does.  Hey, does some show prep?  No, we do the show prep.  We do all that.  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Now, did Sam get all this bottled information from Wikipedia?  Yeah, well, we do a lot of our show prep on Wikipedia.  That could be one of our problems. 
[00:10:00]  They are just a corny little show.  They're not really competition for it.  I don't think they have the same audiences that we do.  I don't think that the same guys that I see at my shows are not probably Elvis fans.  Of course not.  That's not the point I'm making.  It just shows you how sad radio is in general that that's the number one show people are listening to.  Because there's nothing he's actually doing that is important.  Elvis Duran could retire, or he could die, or he could quit, or whatever. 
[00:10:30]  And they could just get another guy.  Just call him Elvis Duran.  For the first week, people go, wait a minute.  That's not Elvis Duran.  Or, wait, what's wrong with Elvis Duran?  He sounds different.  And then within a week, people will just think it's the same dude.  Let's go to Rob in Westchester.  Rob, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hold on, hold on.  Elvis Duran is doing a bit called Battle of the Babies.  The search for America's most beautiful baby. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, God, stop it.  Voting for round three is closed.  All right, baby pig baby.  Right, baby pig baby we can do.  Is your baby ready to rumble?  Z100's looking for America's most beautiful baby.  And if your baby is up for the challenge, you could walk away with $5,000.  Wow, can we do an extra chromosome baby contest?  Yes, we can.  Biggest tongue.  America's most beautiful baby. 
[00:11:30]  God, I wonder what those promos sound like.  Let's say hi to Rob in Westchester.  Rob, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I work for Kyle Anderson and my partner.  Every freaking morning, he puts on the Z morning too.  Right.  And he forces me to listen.  They start giggling and get all funny because they say sex.  Or they talk about the stupidest baby as crap.  And my friend, my partner's sitting there laughing, laughing.  I had to actually bring in my XM satellite and put it in the truck every day so this guy 
[00:12:00]  could understand what we're doing.  It's the most obnoxious thing ever.  Is your partner sexually confused?  Probably pretty close to it.  All right, guys.  Pleasure to see you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Joe on Long Island.  So we're learning that Elvis Duran is a square.  He has a contest where he's looking for the most beautiful baby.  Yeah.  He does celebrity sleaze, which is just reading, you know, crap from gossip columns.  Yeah.  Joe, what do you got?  Yeah, I've listened to this guy a couple times only because before I got the XM, I couldn't 
[00:12:30]  get you guys on the radio out in the long island.  This guy is terrible.  Everything he says, he's like a reporter.  When he reports, he doesn't say how he feels.  He doesn't give any insight, nothing.  He just, uh, uh, today a news-like type of guy where he says nothing of the radio show  is gone.  He is.  That's what you mean.  He doesn't say anything of any importance and nothing, and all he does is play crappy  pop music all day. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  All right, well.  Yeah, they got none but idiots on the show.  It's terrible.  The show doesn't even compete.  I don't even know why.  It doesn't even constitute you guys even talking about it because they're garbage.  I know, but he's got his picture in the paper, and they're bragging about how he destroyed  an old demo, so now we're taking a look at why so many people would listen to, uh, you  know, a station like that.  That's all.  Thank you, Joe.  And I gotta tell you, because people will read into this, we're jealous that we're not 
[00:13:30]  doing better in the ratings, but I'm certainly not jealous that someone like Elvis Duran is  getting huge ratings, because I know that he's not really doing anything.  I am.  And that, uh, pretty much anyone could step in and take over his, uh, his slot and do  the exact same thing.  It, there's nothing special there whatsoever.  Uh, let's go to Charlie in Philly.  And our phones are lit every morning from all over America, so I don't get it.  What's up, Charlie?  What's up, boys?  How are ya?  Hey, it's the wave of the future, Opie. 
[00:14:00]  Everybody's in love with Romper Room Radio.  Letter of the day.  Let's pour 10,000 marbles down steps.  Woo-hoo!  Lee-lee.  Uh, you're referring to the Preston and Steve bit in Philly, where they, they thought it  would be really exciting to, I don't even remember, remember how many marbles they decided  to just roll down the, um, museum steps.  Oh, that was 10,000, I think it was crazy, though.  It was the biggest flop in radio history, but they do great in the ratings.  You're, you're right, Romper Room Radio's in. 
[00:14:30]  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Um, the problem is you're not doing traffic and weather on the 8s anymore.  Well, uh, Club Soda Kenny will be doing traffic and, uh, weather on the 8s.  Well, thank goodness for that, because that's why I bought my XM.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, bye-bye.  All right.  Uh, let's say hi to Brian in Detroit.  Brian.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, just waking up, getting ready to go.  How are you?  I'm, I'm terrific.  Thank you.  It's not just New York where these awful, awful radio shows are just, are killing. 
[00:15:00]  Here in Detroit, they've got this, uh, this awful station that plays the pop music.  They do the thing called the War of the Roses, where they, they catch the guy cheating on  the girl.  It's awful.  Oh, and it's fake.  My girlfriend cannot wait to tell me every day, did you hear that?  I was like, no, I listen to a real radio show.  Just tell her it's fake, sir.  It's fake.  Yeah, it's fake.  What, what's that show called in Detroit?  Uh, I, you know, it's on channel 955. 
[00:15:30]  It's awful.  How do you listen to terrestrial radio?  Right.  I'm going to have them in two vehicles just so I can have you guys on constantly.  That and Squiz.  All right.  That's the only thing that's played in my cars.  Thank you, sir.  The Opie and Anthony show, no squares here.  Let's go to Gene in Connecticut.  Gene.  Hey, what's going on, Opie and Anthony?  Uh, I heard, I heard, uh, uh, Elvis Duran a couple of times.  You know, the reason why I think he's getting big ratings is because he gives women a voice  on the show.  Like, he's got these women hosts, and I think it's mainly girls that listen to them. 
[00:16:00]  So we need to have a hole on the show.  Yeah.  And they've got a segment called, uh, Stupid News, where they read, like, these, uh, corny  stories about some guy robbing a store and getting caught, you know, tripping on the  way out.  Right, right.  And he ran straight into a police department.  Yeah, you know what's sad?  We get those exact same stories, but they're embarrassing to read, so we blow it off.  There was a story, uh, yesterday where they, uh, put, like, a wetsuit on a penguin so he 
[00:16:30]  could survive and start swimming again.  It's like, and I know, like, radio shows would do that whole story.  It's like, why?  It's embarrassing.  All right, guys, punch out.  Take care.  All right.  So there you go.  Uh, I mean, we could go to this all morning.  Look at this.  The phone's just completely lit.  I don't get it.  These, these morning zoos are becoming really, really popular.  They're very safe.  They play the pop songs of the day.  So when you hear the pop song, you're like, oh, I like this song.  So you keep the radio station on, you know, but you're not, you're not going to get 
[00:17:00]  any surprises or anything edgy.  Well, you're going to get, uh, prizes, but not surprises.  Yeah.  So whatever.  But there you go.  So we're, uh, a bit confused on this, on this station and on this show today, because  last week they were calling us, corporate was calling us like, oh my God, the new rating  system that's going into effect in the fall.  You guys are destroying.  And then, uh, yesterday, um, uh, no one called.  I finally had a call corporate like at seven o'clock last night.  I know the ratings come in at like, uh, nine, I think. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  So from nine to seven, I'm like, all right, what's going on?  There's a reason why they're not calling.  And then I finally got someone on the phone.  They're like, well, they, they were so bad that I figured, uh, I, I didn't need to call  you because you know, it's just ridiculous because we're, we're sort of not following,  uh, you know, these ratings as much as the new ratings that are going into effect.  So it's just a big cluster F.  What can I tell you?  Hey, uh, big news here in New York and, and everywhere else. 
[00:18:00]  This, uh, this, uh, Hannah, uh, Montana, uh, uh, uh, picture.  Yes.  Billy Ray Cyrus is a sick ass.  First of all.  Yeah.  You see some of the pictures with her.  Yeah.  That's what I'm getting at.  Like laying down with her and well, they're posing like, uh, Billy Ray Cyrus has a young  lover, you know, he's kind of holding her in his arms.  Like you would your, your chick.  And she's got her eyes kind of shut, little bedroom eyes going on and got a little tank top  on.  She's showing belly.  She's got tight jeans on and she's in her father's arms in such a way. 
[00:18:30]  It doesn't look like this is her father.  They are country.  That kind of, you know, yeah, man, you don't know what's going on there.  You know that she's worth like a billion dollars.  They're saying, or this really, or this, uh, franchise is worth a billion dollars.  I don't know how much she gets out of that.  Anyway, uh, Billy Ray Cyrus took all those pictures and then he left the photo shoot.  Of course, we're talking about the pictures that are going to be in vanity fair.  I mean, this magazine is going to sell out and, um, a 15 year old half naked.  It's amazing.  Well, this is what I'm getting at, Jimmy. 
[00:19:00]  Know what happened with the half naked picture.  Billy Ray Cyrus and I think his wife as well left the photo shoot, said, okay, the photo  shoot's over.  And they had a supervisor.  Um, um, what's her name anyway?  Uh, Miley, right?  Miley's grandma was supervising.  And some other lady were supervising the final shot.  The, the shot that is, is creating a lot of controversy was the final shot in the photo  shoot.  After Billy Ray Cyrus left, Annie Leibovitz is like, ah, let's try one more shot here and 
[00:19:30]  convinced, uh, this girl.  Well, cause daddy wasn't around to take this particular shot.  So Billy Ray Cyrus is a pretty outraged and, and, uh, really pissed.  And Disney saying, you're not going to see Miley anytime soon.  She's in hiding.  But just the fact that vanity fair is using that one on the cover.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Well, it's going to sell, right?  Look, let's buy.  I don't know if it's going to be on the cover.  It's sexualizing, uh, a 15 year old.  Maybe not.  Maybe the Kennedy thing is, but it's sexualizing a 15 year old. 
[00:20:00]  Obviously everyone who looks at that knows exactly what it is.  It's her back.  It's still, I don't think it's a big deal either, but that is what it is.  That's a big deal.  Cause she's 15.  It's the big target for some stuff.  See, it's not, but it's not, it's not, it's not the point that it's just her back.  She's posed in an extremely sexy way.  And that's what everyone has a problem with.  Disney's statement says the situation was created to deliberately manipulate a 15 year  old.  So, uh, it's getting a lot of publicity, but you know how they say, uh, you know, all publicity 
[00:20:30]  is good publicity.  Not in her case.  Cause she's so like the family oriented and Disney's camp and, and the franchise is worth  a billion dollars.  This is actually not a good thing for, for, for her and everyone else.  It's supposed to be a wholesome and a whot not.  But, uh, the newspapers and the news is, uh, pretty much just as guilty as anyone else  as they're talking about the outrage that these pictures are, uh, spurring there. 
[00:21:00]  They're showing the pictures blown up to sizes.  I've never seen them just huge.  They're finding all kinds of new ones of her with, uh, guys, her kind of pulling her shirt  down and showing the top of her bra.  You know, there's a, I don't even have to go to a website to open up the newspapers and  you'll see it.  You make a good point because if this was never in the newspapers, I would have never known  that Miley Cyrus did this photo shoot.  I wouldn't pick up vanity fair.  I, I, I don't think I've ever picked up vanity fair. 
[00:21:30]  She does, uh, come off with older than a 15.  Well, the voice, especially, yeah, the voice, especially, you know, but you make a good point  about the newspapers.  They're the ones that are actually spreading the outrageousness.  Yeah.  Everyone's outraged by, they see it in the newspaper by saying, look at how outrageous  these photos are.  It's like, yeah, but it's in your newspaper.  You're every single one of them.  You're pushing this story to the next level and making it, making it even bigger than  it is.  It's just amazing.  All right.  Just getting started. 
[00:22:00]  Our phone number 877-212-0108.  Yes, Jimmy.  When we come back, can I, I cannot believe that it almost feels like a self-destructive  thing in the black community.  The way Reverend Wright.  Oh God.  It is amazing to me.  This is the first national, viable black candidate who really could win the election.  Yeah.  And the fact that the, I just can't believe the way people are acting.  Not that you should, you should ignore life, but the fact that this guy can't just shut 
[00:22:30]  up until Barack is nominated.  Yep.  The fact that Sharpton is blasting him.  He's dancing in front of white people.  The fact the NAA, I don't, what are you doing?  He's dancing.  Like, we're trying to appease white people.  He was doing the oogly, oogly dance and stuff.  He didn't say dancing.  He said showboating or whatever.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Well, let's get into it right after the break.  It's on the front page of one of our newspapers here in New York and we got an update on that  daughter that was in the, uh, locked in the basement, uh, you know, where the father was 
[00:23:00]  raping her for 24 years and fathered seven kids, six survived.  Uh, we got more details on that six story.  He's great.  He's great.  An update on the Roger Clemens controversy.  Hey, he's a goer.  Yeah.  Oof.  Uh, GTA comes out today.  Mm-hmm.  Um, Flyers won and beat your dumb Canadians, Travis.  We got lots to do today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  What's going on with the Celtics? 
[00:23:30]  You see the big game last night, Anthony?  Huh?  Oh, my God.  I couldn't believe it.  Uh, the Celtics.  Yeah.  Um, what's going on with them?  Well, the Hawks, the stupid Hawks.  Yeah, the Hawks, uh, beat the Celtics.  Went in there.  The series is tied at 2-2.  And, uh, that series now tied at 2-2.  The Hawks.  I could, the Hawks, um.  Surprising everybody.  Surprising everybody.  During the playoffs this year.  During the playoffs this year.  Not many people given that much chance.  Not many people given that much of a chance.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:24:00]  But so far, hanging in there with the Celtics.  Hanging in there with the Celtics.  That's right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  And Pat Riley, wow, huh?  How about Pat Riley, right?  Well, why don't you tell everybody.  Pat Riley.  You know, uh, Pat Riley.  What, what, what, what can I say about him?  Well, the legend.  Yeah.  Quitting as head coach of the Miami Heat.  Quitting as head coach of the Miami Heat.  That's pretty amazing.  That's what I was going to say.  Then you got the, the stupid Rangers.  Yeah, the Rangers.  Did you expect this with the Rangers? 
[00:24:30]  Uh, yes, actually I did.  You did?  Yeah.  What did you expect?  Them to win.  Well, they're losing.  I know.  Yeah.  But I expected them to win.  Oh, I got you.  The Penguins are up, uh, two zip in that series.  Yes.  Game three tonight.  A lot of Ranger fans listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  That's all right.  Rangers, uh, they're a comeback team.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Are they?  Uh, well.  Pittsburgh's tough.  Penguins are tough.  Tough team.  Tough team.  877-212-0-8.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to talk about Reverend Wright.  But first, uh, Sam is running in this audio. 
[00:25:00]  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you.  Because we gotta, we gotta learn about, uh, the enemy.  We gotta learn about our competition.  So we got a quick hit here, right, Sam?  Yeah.  Just a quick, uh, example of what they're talking about this morning.  Okay.  Uh, here in New York City, um, well, the number one morning radio show is this Elvis Duran  and the morning zoo.  Yeah.  Uh, not only is he, uh, number one in mornings here in New York City, he's destroying in mornings.  Like, destroying.  No one's coming close.  And, uh, we learned so far that he plays a lot of pop music. 
[00:25:30]  He plays, uh, fake prank calls because you're not allowed to do prank calls on the radio  anymore.  But people are buying them like they're real prank calls.  And, uh, now what do we got?  Now, uh, some, some of the banter that they do every morning?  Yeah, well, they usually start their show by, I forgot to tell you, taking calls about  how funny they are.  And then this would be an example of how funny they are just going off the cuff and bantering,  you know, in the morning.  So, I want to hear this.  I want to hear the magic that, uh, makes them a highly rated program. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  And, and, uh, quickly, uh, somebody on instant feedback.  Remember we were talking about swimming pool?  Yeah.  That amazing movie.  Yeah.  Because the girl is young and voluptuous and sexual and nymphonic.  If that's a word.  Well, if voluptuous is, why not?  I like voluptuous.  It's part of my vocabulary.  And I, I now want to, uh, your vom-cabulary. 
[00:26:30]  Is nymphonic a word?  Nymphonic?  It is now.  I like nymphonic.  Why not?  Um.  Why not?  This guy, he doesn't, he doesn't leave his name because he's doing it from a little mobile  device there.  He says, Opie, you suck.  I rented a swimming pool last night and boy, did it suck.  I get that the girl looked hot, which is why you enjoyed it.  But the movie sucked.  We never said the movie itself was good.  Oh, you dummy.  You dummy.  Gotta listen closer.  We said the movie was great because this girl's in it. 
[00:27:00]  This girl is just naked.  Uh, I don't even know.  I mean, doesn't Mr. Skin tell you how long the girl's naked in the movie?  She's topless.  She's having sex with strangers.  She's, she's, uh, she's popping out of the pool while a guy's sitting on the edge and  then takes care of him.  Does a little service call.  You got the old broad wishing she was young and, and, and nymphotic.  Nymphotic.  That's why we, we love this movie.  Not because, uh, it was an actually, an actual good, you know, storyline. 
[00:27:30]  Storyline.  Jackass.  Thank you.  All right.  So, uh, back to Sam.  So they, they start to show by saying, you know, having callers call and say how funny  they are.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  All right.  That's nice.  All right.  And what else?  And then this I brought in, I was like, oh, well then I can't wait for them to get funny.  And they did.  Wow.  Okay.  Oh, so you got an example of them being funny.  Yeah.  They bring the funny.  Oh, big time.  By the way, a swimming pool from the year 2003, cause I think there's another version. 
[00:28:00]  And if you rent that, you're going to be very disappointed.  Briefly disappointed.  Yes.  Okay.  Uh, the, the number one morning show here in New York city did this a mere 15 minutes  ago.  I don't, I don't get it.  Uh, maybe someone will demonstrate to me, uh, on the Snoopy doll, how you use them, what  a maxi pad needs to do.  Okay.  Come on.  You know, I don't know.  I just, I just, come on.  Come on.  You hear the hole.  Does the hole always have to be the hole? 
[00:28:30]  Does she always have to be the, Oh, come on.  Oh guys.  Oh, you're so wild.  Can we get a montage of holes across America?  Holes across America.  Let's do holes across America.  A montage of what they actually add to morning radio.  They, they add what you just heard.  Oh, come on.  Guys, it's getting a little crazy.  You're talking about a maxi pad.  Now stop guys.  All they do is remind us of why we don't want to hang out with them.  Oh, every time they talk, they remind us of why we like to hang with guys more. 
[00:29:00]  Shut up.  I like to hang with girls.  Not to be funny.  I don't ever.  No one wants to, no one wants to hear, Oh guys, do you think people are driving and go,  Oh, good thing.  She's there keeping them in line.  How many jokes have you made around, around women?  They're like, Oh, that you're like, why are you?  Oh, and please don't look too deep into what we're doing today and, and, and start saying  we're jealous because we're not jealous. 
[00:29:30]  No, we're gay.  Because this is, this is the type of radio we have no desire to do.  It's just God awful.  All right.  So, uh, back to the, uh, the, the cute banter.  Yeah.  Needs to do.  Okay.  Come on.  You know, I don't know.  I, I, I just know it's this big thing and has wings or whatever.  My brother used to take them and he used to take the back off and tape them to the wall.  And he would make a design on the wall when he was a kid.  Really?  Well, how do we compete against this? 
[00:30:00]  I, um, boy, they shut us down.  One sec.  Yeah.  That's one flag of fun right there.  The funnel meter is not happy.  One sec.  Yeah.  One flag.  I wouldn't even give them one flag, but that's the lowest our fun meter goes, right?  One sec.  Yeah.  One flag.  Yeah.  So the number one, uh, morning show in New York city. 
[00:30:30]  First of all, the host is going to make believe he's never seen a maxi.  I don't know what it is.  They got wings on them.  I thought, what are these things?  And he's going to make believe he doesn't know how it's used.  Where do they even go?  What is it used for?  I have no idea.  I have no interest in that part of the women's anatomy.  And you know what?  He, he might be used.  Maybe I should shut up.  I have a great line, but I can't use it.  Can I write it down? 
[00:31:00]  Wait, hold on a minute.  What?  Hold on.  Hold on a minute.  Where did we go?  That's not the one?  Oh, here it is.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:31:30]  Because it would come out.  I get it.  That would be a tough one to get hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Well, we're back with the Opie and Anthony's show.  But I have heard that he does swing in that direction.  Well, yeah.  That's funny.  I've heard things.  Because that, oh my God, would that be messy?  Anyway, back to their, uh, their, their lovely discussion about maxi pads. 
[00:32:00]  Did you just say it flies?  It has wings?  Yeah, they had.  Froggy.  What?  It flies?  Like, you said it has wings.  Did Froggy say that?  Froggy.  Froggy.  Oh, Froggy, you're wild.  It doesn't fly.  Leave it to Froggy.  Froggy thinks maxi pads fly.  One sec.  Yeah, one flag of fun.  It's not, Froggy.  They're so, it's better held against the c***.  Froggy's not even in their studio.  He gets to hang out in Miami and they make believe he's in studio with them. 
[00:32:30]  What a f***ing ass.  Oh, Froggy.  It goes on a bloody c***.  It doesn't, uh, it doesn't fly.  It doesn't have to fly.  Yuck.  Right.  Did you just say it flies?  It has wings?  Yeah, they had.  Froggy.  What?  It flies?  Like, you said it has wings.  You know, you can tell that this Froggy probably says a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense  and they've just had it up to here.  Oh, oh, they've done with Froggy. 
[00:33:00]  Froggy's a bit edgy and uneducated.  They gotta explain a lot to them.  I like the sign.  Froggy.  Oh, Froggy.  The hole chimes in.  Well, she's there to keep it safe, you know, because without a hole in the area, guys could  get a little wild, right guys?  Yeah, it might get wild.  Think of where that conversation could have gone if she wasn't there to hold the reins  back.  You need a nice corridor completely separating you from funny.  Yes.  Nice, narrow corridor.  Where she just directs everybody.  With just a hole on both sides. 
[00:33:30]  A hole representing like a moat.  This way to the no comedy room.  Don't go over there by the funny room.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  It does well in the ratings.  Yeah.  This is killing of the ratings, so that's why we want to take a little look today.  One flag.  One flag of fun.  That's right.  Did you just say flies has wings?  Yeah, they have...  Froggy.  What?  It flies?  No, no, no.  You know, it has wings.  They have wings, wings, but not...  Froggy's being a little comedian today.  Yeah.  What are the wings for?  What are the wings for?  They tuck underneath your panties so that you, you know, you get extra protection and things 
[00:34:00]  don't go where they're not supposed to go.  It covers the sides.  Because they'll spill over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Time to change the subject.  Oh, my God.  Well, no.  You did ask, and she did give an answer.  It's a way of life.  Stop being skivats.  Exactly.  Skivats.  Skivats, guys.  It's time to change the subject.  Hey, I don't want to hear anything else about a vagina.  Right.  Perish the thought.  That icky vagina.  Yeah.  Yuck. 
[00:34:30]  Ugh.  It's got wings.  It's all froggy.  Jimmy.  That's kind of where it's got wings.  It flies?  Yes, it flies, dummy.  And it attracts flies, too.  Maybe that's what he meant.  Froggy is a douche.  Wait.  It's a pad?  People live in it?  It's got wings?  Oh, no, froggy.  Stop.  Oh, froggy.  You're getting a little crazy now, you little comedian, you. 
[00:35:00]  He's being a little comedian today.  Hi-oh.  A little comedian.  When you say comedian, you have to do a hi-oh.  Hi-oh.  I picked up on that, too.  That froggy is incorrigible.  Oh, boy.  You better watch it with froggy.  Froggy's always going to say something nuts.  Have your finger on the button.  A big F you to anyone that listens to radio.  Finding this crap entertaining.  Ugh.  I guess it does well.  It sure does.  It's got wings?  It's got wings?  That's all I want to say.  That's all I want to say.  That's all I want to say.  That's all I want to say.  Hi-oh. 
[00:35:30]  Who's driving going, oh, did you hear froggy this morning driving into work?  Did you hear froggy this morning?  Because when I was driving in, he actually asked about the pads, Kotex having wings, and  then wanted to know if it flew.  I know.  I heard it, too.  Oh, God.  Then hand each other a gun, put it in your mouth, and pull the trigger.  Wings?  Did he hear the morning zoo?  They didn't even know what maxi-pads are.  Maxi-pads.  I heard it, too. 
[00:36:00]  No, wait.  I heard it, too.  Can you believe it?  Let's talk about it by the water cooler.  All right.  I'll meet you there.  Let's go.  We'll talk about it.  Hey, you're not going to the water cooler.  I'll talk to you.  I'll be there in a second.  Get it bubbling so we know we're near the water cooler.  Bloop, bloop.  Bloop, bloop.  Hey, did you hear that, too?  Bloop, bloop.  Hey, give me your water bottle.  I'll fill it up for you.  Thanks.  Because I'm saving the environment.  So, froggy. 
[00:36:30]  Hi-yo!  How's a fly?  Hi-yo!  I'm in Florida.  I heard it, too, this morning, guys.  What are you talking about here, by the water?  Oh, the morning zoo.  I heard it.  That froggy, right?  He said it has wings.  I heard that.  And he didn't know.  He thought it was used to fly.  Oh.  Can we just hear froggy?  I can't wait to see what he says tomorrow.  Can't we just get new froggy, Jimmy?  I gotta hear wings.  You gotta get it.  Please.  Where was the wings part? 
[00:37:00]  The beginning of it?  Life?  All right, hold on.  There's a picture of it.  Is that him?  His mouth looks like he says his S is weird.  Yes.  There's a weird S mouth.  His teeth are in the shape of an S.  That's why he makes a weird S freaking sound.  Did you just say it flies has wings?  Yeah, they have.  Oh, you're right.  He does.  Oh, geez.  Flies?  Flies?  Wings?  Has wings?  What?  It flies?  No, no, no.  It has wings.  You know it has wings. 
[00:37:30]  Froggy's being a little comedian today.  What are the wings for?  What are the wings for?  It's like underneath your panties so that you get extra protection and things don't go where  they're not supposed to go.  It covers the side.  All right, how ugly is she?  Because she has kind of a nice voice, which means she's got to be really up there on the  ugly hair.  That whiny thing?  Yeah.  Oh, she's all right.  Ah, she's all right.  All right, I'll give her that much.  I'll give her the business.  You what?  Wings?  Fluxy.  Hi-oh!  Fluxy.  Hey, let's change the subject.  Don't talk about attractive girls. 
[00:38:00]  Listen, look at this dummy.  Dave in White Plains.  Dave.  Hey, at least they got a show.  You guys are publicizing their show.  We're doing your own show.  Oh, we are.  It says on the line, do your own show, please.  This is what we do.  We're doing our show.  That's right.  We're publicizing.  You guys can't even come up with anything original.  At least they got something going on.  Hey, we got you listening, you dummy.  How dumb are you that you're listening to our show and calling and saying you don't have  anything original?  You dummy.  You woke up and went out of your way. 
[00:38:30]  You dummy.  You got up and went out of your way to tune in our show, you idiot.  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  Let's talk about what?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  How stupid are you?  I told Jeremiah in the morning.  We talked about Sean Bell for an hour yesterday, you dope.  What did he want to bring up? 
[00:39:00]  He's probably, you know, somehow associated with that show.  Where are you going?  You hung up the phone.  You got to do one show.  You're publicizing him.  Froggy rules.  All I want to hear is froggy now.  That's all I want to do is just isolate froggy sound clips.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Where's the bacon?  I smell bacon, bacon, bacon.  It's got to be bacon.  Only one thing smells like bacon and that's bacon.  Bacon, bacon, bacon there.  Please, please, give me what's in the bag. 
[00:39:30]  Chewy, yummy, smoky bacon.  There you go.  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  It's bacon.  See, we do wacky bits.  What was that?  That's E-Rock.  That's E-Rock doing the begging strips commercial.  Yeah.  How old is that?  It's brand new.  We had him do it on Friday.  Because it sounded like him just yearning for some type of pork product.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Tommy in New Mexico, it looks like.  Tommy, what's up? 
[00:40:00]  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I was going in to say how great it was to have you guys in the new GTA just all over the place.  I turn on the game like two minutes into it.  I hear Fezzy on the radio and then Patrice shows up.  It's great.  Yeah, I got to say, GTA's coming out today.  They're talking about the fact that it might sell nine million copies in the first week.  Like, these videos, GTA does way better than any movie that comes out.  Yeah, they play it right.  Nine million in a week times what? 
[00:40:30]  What is it up to, like $50 a game?  Yeah.  You could get discounts here and there if you look around.  But for the most, let's say it's $50 a game times nine million.  It's got to be something like 50, 60,000 bucks.  Perhaps more than that, Ant.  Thank you.  If it's $50 a game and they sell nine million in the first week, that would be $450 million  they take in from the first week of the game.  And they're talking about selling 10 million total.  Really?  Yeah.  10 million. 
[00:41:00]  What?  Most people will buy it in the first week and then it drastically drops off.  But then over a period of time that the game is out, it should sell about 10 million copies.  Yeah, the cool part of this GTA, we're all over it.  I mean, Anthony sings a jingle for a beer commercial.  I'm a reporter.  We're all characters in this thing.  I'm a bad guy.  A lot of the comedians you know and love from the show, a lot of the staff members are in there.  You got Ron and Fez.  They're in there.  It's unbelievable how many voices you're going to recognize in GTA 4. 
[00:41:30]  Our comic friends.  The new game coming out today.  You should listen.  There's one part where the car is falling off a bridge and you'll just hear someone going,  It flies?  It has waves?  It has waves?  Oh!  Hi-yo!  Oh, guys.  Come on.  A little secret, too.  If you want us to stop talking about, or stop doing a bit, the best thing you can do is  not call the show and say, Stop talking about that bit.  What did he...  Because now all we're going to do is play their audio today. 
[00:42:00]  What did he want us to talk about?  I don't understand.  I don't know.  He's not a fan of the show.  No, I'm just...  He obviously is trying to stick up for them.  He's probably calling...  Yeah, it sounded like he wanted us to address something.  Sean Bell.  Or talk about something.  We talked about Sean Bell for an hour yesterday.  We had some good conversation about it.  Oh, was that it?  And we're going to talk about it.  And we're going to talk about...  We're going to talk about the stupid reverend.  We'll talk about Reverend Wright next.  Reverend Wright.  How's that sound?  I would like black people to call.  I want to hear opinions from black people.  I feel like black people...  I mean, this is like self-destructive almost. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  It's like, what are you doing?  Yeah.  I mean, they really should take this guy aside and say, Look, could you just put your  own agenda aside for a moment?  Got a black candidate running here.  You're tied to him.  And no matter what you think or say, it's going to go back to him.  It's going to reflect on him.  But he's making it worse.  It's almost on purpose.  And it's almost like the way Sharpton is reacting and the way the NAACP gives this guy a net.  I don't get it.  It's almost like the nomination is almost there. 
[00:43:00]  Can't you just see the bigger picture and shut your mouth?  Oh, bigger picture.  Sorry.  Oof.  Yeah.  We'll talk about it after the break.  But I can't believe...  Well, we could sneak this in.  The NAACP gives him a national stage.  Yeah.  How stupid.  Obama says Reverend Wright does not speak for his campaign.  In this clip, Reverend Wright says he's not Obama's spiritual leader, but continues to  make controversial statements.  Here is Reverend Wright.  I'm a pastor.  He's a member. 
[00:43:30]  I'm not a spiritual mentor.  Oh, really?  I'm a guru.  Wright referencing his longtime parishioner, Barack Obama.  He's making no attempt, though, to stay out of the spotlight, thus potentially making  life harder for Obama's campaign.  Here comparing U.S. troops to the Roman legions who killed Christ.  Yes, I can compare that.  We have troops stationed all over the world, just like Rome had troops stationed all over  the world, because we run the world.  Oh, boy.  Just.  He's got to relax a little bit. 
[00:44:00]  Actually, I like this, because I'm a McCain guy.  He's wrecking.  He is single-handedly going to ruin this campaign.  Yeah.  And the fact that Sharpton is saying that he just wants to perform in front of a white  people, it's amazing.  It's almost like there's this really weird undercurrent where they don't want it.  It's almost like, what, does Sharpton have a vested interest in this guy not winning?  Or does the NAACP, what is it?  Does him winning remove some of your necessity?  I don't get it.  It's very good. 
[00:44:30]  If a black president is elected, then it kind of shows like, hey, anyone could do this.  Any black man can do this.  If you follow in his footsteps, education, go into politics, assimilate to society.  Anyone could do this.  And they don't want to see that.  That makes them obsolete.  Every candidate has a bane or whatever.  I'm sure everyone's got someone.  Clintons have had them and Bush has them. 
[00:45:00]  But I'm almost like, for this guy to be on a media tear, this close to the nomination,  when Obama's, it's almost so self-destructive.  It's embarrassing.  It's extremely self-serving.  He doesn't give a crap.  He sees an opportunity to get his name out there and become bigger than he is.  He doesn't care about Obama and his campaign at this point.  Him saying he's not his spiritual advisor.  He's known him for 20 years.  He brought him to Christianity.  He actually was the guy that brought Obama over to Christianity. 
[00:45:30]  Presided over his wedding.  There were a couple of other things that he had done for him as his spiritual advisor.  And believe me, they might not be making a big deal out of this now, but forget about it.  If it came down to McCain and Obama, McCain would be using this like crazy.  Like, yeah, like crazy.  Speaking of that, Obama's trying to distance himself. 
[00:46:00]  Good luck.  Here we go.  There was Wright over the weekend talking about slain President John Kennedy.  Yes, not what your country can do for you.  Yes, rather, what you can do for your country.  How do you spell yes?  Some of the comments that Reverend Wright have made offend me.  He does not speak for me.  He does not speak for the campaign.  I am running for office.  I am open to being vice president.  He's just a showbo looking for his damn attention.  And what do black people do? 
[00:46:30]  Love him and welcome him with open arms.  Congratulations.  You're sinking the first real black candidate.  Congratulations.  Excellent job.  You know what Middle America's doing?  Oh, boy.  Excellent job.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Makes fun of the accent of the last assassinated president.  How do you spell yes?  Yeah.  Good.  Very good.  Brooke.  Wasn't JFK extremely supportive as far as black issues?  What a dope.  We've got to take a break.  We really did.  Why don't we go to the phones next, see if anybody wants to talk about this. 
[00:47:00]  877-212-088.  More froggy audio, hopefully.  Also, GTA 4, already a controversial game.  We've got the news acting like they know about gaming.  Exactly.  Shut your traps.  We've got more audio from banned cartoons.  We've got the update on the woman that was locked in the old cellar for 24 years.  We've got, you know how they do stupid news, like silly news?  Well, we've got a silly lampshade story that we didn't get to yesterday. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, it's silly, all right.  Oh, boy, is it.  We're going to do that next as well.  Opie and Anthony, lots to do today.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm coming at you, Pittsburgh, May 2nd, the Byham Theater.  You've got to go to Ticketmaster for tickets.  It'll be me, and it'll be a lot of fun.  I was made for loving you, baby.  You were made for loving me. 
[00:48:00]  And I can't get enough of you, baby.  Radio Shock Jock.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, thanks for checking us out today.  We've got the phones lit.  Maybe you can get through a little later on.  877-212-ON-A.  Talking about Reverend Wright.  Going to be talking about GTA because the news programs.  I want the boys in the office to be on high alert because, you know, you know these news programs have no clue about the gaming world.  And it's actually very humorous how they talk about these controversial games on TV. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, they know nothing about them.  Nothing.  And by the way, a lot of people saying that the price of GTA is actually about $60.  Really?  So now we've got to up that to $540 million this game could take in in the first week.  No movie comes close to that, obviously.  It's a nice piece of change.  And also, thank you to Kent, the movie guy.  He writes, GTA is the best reviewed game in years.  We noticed that, too.  It's getting perfect tens or close, like 9.8s. 
[00:49:00]  And that's unheard of, Anthony?  I don't know.  Yeah, all over.  Like, usually you'll get a few magazines that'll bash it or a few websites.  This, if you go to one of these sites that show you all the reviews, the lowest this thing got was like a 97.  But just hundreds.  Wow.  Getting hundreds across the board.  The storyline is really great, entertaining.  Yes, fan?  So, wait, they're saying it's a perfect game.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is.  So they haven't found anything wrong with it, a lot of these, you know, serious reviewers.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  That's unbelievable.  Great game.  They're saying that there are flaws, but it advances the genre so much that it doesn't matter that, like, the camera gets a little weird every now and then.  Oh, is that, like, one of the things?  Yeah, and, like, there's been a couple things, like the aim, but it's, like, so trivial.  Oh, yeah, compared to all the other Grand Theft Auto games that have come out before this one, you can't even compare it.  They improve on everything.  You can't even compare it to the last version.  It is interesting how you watch it grow so you don't really immediately notice a difference, but if you went back and played the, you know... 
[00:50:00]  An older version?  An older version.  Sure.  And you're like, oh, my God, this looks like crap.  Yeah.  The main guy never even spoke in the first one.  Yeah, yeah, right?  He just kind of walked around.  Where's our copies?  They should be coming very shortly.  Well, they better get here immediately.  I don't...  You know, because at this point, you go to these stores, and you get an empty box, and you've got to wait.  I want that immediately, because my day is going to be spent...  Drinking? 
[00:50:30]  Well, yeah.  On my couch playing this game.  Yeah, right on.  That is it.  And if there's any really good weapons in it, I'm going to go out and buy the real thing, because that's how I determine how I buy my real guns, buy my video game guns.  I know, that's a new thing you're into, which is extremely self-destructive, but...  No, it makes shopping for weapons very easy, because you get to almost give it a little test run in the game, and then you go to the gun store and go, I want that. 
[00:51:00]  Speaking of Anthony, we're all in GTA 4.  Jimmy, what's your character in GTA 4?  One guy is...  Homosexual?  No, no, no, no.  Oh.  I had no idea answer for that, so I just answered it accurately.  No, no, no, no.  I play a guy who runs porn or something like that.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, okay.  You own a porn store, or you're like a clerk at a porn store.  Yes.  I'm part of the Irish mob, but I don't speak in an Irish dialect, so...  I'm a bad guy, too.  Yeah.  I get to do a lot of screaming. 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  Way to typecast.  Yeah.  But we got Anthony.  He did the jingle for the beer commercial in GTA 4.  Oh, yeah.  He'll be hearing this one.  This is definitely a highlight that you're going to hear a lot when you play the game.  Here it is.  Anthony, everyone.  Last night, I think I ****ed the bed.  Got so drunk, I need a ****.  No beeps in the real one.  Life is just a merciful blur when you pop a piss-wasta.  Piss-wasta, don't bring it slow.  3 a.m. 
[00:52:00]  Buy some clothes.  Sleep in the bathroom on the floor.  What really matters anymore?  All the crap you do all day.  Who **** cares?  Anyway.  Piss-wasta, this is beer.  Drive drunk on the beer.  Piss-wasta, drink all day.  It helps your trouble slow away.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Piss-wasta, cheap German lager for export only. 
[00:52:30]  Very, very nice.  Okay.  The commercial itself is pretty good.  That's one of the commercials that are on the televisions because there's TVs.  Yeah.  And you can watch different news channels and stuff and television shows on the TVs.  And that's one of the TV commercials.  So along with the song, you see like a guy driving off a pier.  Oh, it's animated?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  It's an actual commercial.  That's cool.  And I play a news guy, too, that has some pretty witty, racist remarks. 
[00:53:00]  No way.  Yeah.  That's going to be a surprise.  Yeah, pretty funny.  Hey, Reverend Wright people, stay on hold.  We're going to you in just a couple minutes here.  But first, the WB-11 here in New York talking about GTA.  Coming up in the 6 o'clock hour, get ready for the latest installment of the most anticipated  game of the year, Grand Theft Auto New York City.  Find out where you get a hold of one.  Wrong.  It's not great.  She doesn't even get the name right.  It's GTA 4 yet. 
[00:53:30]  What's that?  You dumb newsreader.  It's GTA 4.  That's it.  GTA New York City.  No.  No.  It's Liberty City.  She wanted to say New Jack City.  You know that, right?  It looks like New York City.  It's a parody of New York City.  But they're not saying it's New York City.  No.  That's not in the title.  GTA 4, already a controversial game.  Dia is a Grand Theft Auto fan.  Getting away with all the things you wouldn't be able to do in real life.  Things like murder, sex with prostitutes, the driving drunk, all part of how to play 
[00:54:00]  the game in the latest edition of Grand Theft Auto.  I don't think it carries over into the real life.  As soon as I get done playing, I feel like then it's just...  Back to real life.  But critics of the game, like Dorothy Johnson from Mothers in Charge, whose son was murdered,  fears that's not the case for all young people.  Young people think this is their reality.  They don't understand that if they go out and kind of act on that, that that person doesn't  get up and walk away.  Can someone stop it?  People do know that in real life they don't get up and walk away, dummy. 
[00:54:30]  And Dorothy, sorry for your son, but why don't you do some simple math, you dummy?  Nine million people are going to pick up this game in the first week.  Right.  That means according to these idiots out there, there's going to be a give or take nine million  murders.  Nine million murders because people don't understand the difference.  There's going to be one or two isolated cases.  And when they look into the case a little further, they're going to realize this person was damaged  to begin with.  Yeah.  There's going to be nine million people run over by cars because of GTA 4 in the first 
[00:55:00]  week alone.  Do the math, you idiots.  You go on the game and you play it and you don't walk out the door thinking, well, I can  just mow people over with my car and I'll get a few stars on me.  I'll go to the paint shop, paint my car, and I'll be fine.  Sure.  There is new research, though, that suggests young players can tell the difference.  After studying 2,100 gaming young people, Larry Kuttner and his co-author wrote Grand Theft  Childhood. 
[00:55:30]  That somehow playing a violent video game will take a typical child and turn him or her into  someone who's a sociopath or who will get into trouble with the law.  There's no evidence to support that at all.  He says games help boys bond and they're actually not drawn to the violence alone.  What they found attractive was the complexity of the story and the complexity of the environment.  Very good.  Yeah, you're using your brains, you're problem solving it.  And also, because none of these people play these games, they have no idea. 
[00:56:00]  It's stress relief from the crap that's actually out in the real world.  You know what some of the worst games are on the market?  Ones that are just run and shoot, run and kill, where there's no storyline, there's no  drama to it, no peripheral fun.  And the worst games are the ones where you get a crappy gun and you just run around shooting  stuff.  Right.  It's horrid.  Because that's not what it's about.  This guy's absolutely right.  It's about a cool storyline.  It's about immersing yourself in that story. 
[00:56:30]  It's like watching a movie that you're kind of part of, that you have a say in how the  movie goes.  But you absolutely identify it as fiction.  And you know when you turn the game off, you're not walking around the house with a  gun.  Oh, wait a minute.  Well, not everyone.  Critics disagree with this new research, by the way.  Critics disagree with the research that we just heard.  Dorothy isn't buying any of it, and she wants parents to start buying a game for kids. 
[00:57:00]  We have young people who are at risk, you know, in urban America today.  Urban America.  The reality is this.  So to continue to promote these kinds of games and put them in the hands of young people,  it's deadly.  Is it?  Is it deadly?  I don't think if you're going to East New York, it's Grand Theft Auto that is causing  the violence, to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Dorothy, do you realize how many hours these people, these kids spend playing these games? 
[00:57:30]  It's a great babysitting tool.  I don't think when you get lost in Bed-Stuy and ask for directions, I don't think GTA has  much of a bearing on if you're going to get killed or not.  You know how many people would just be bored wandering the streets of, let's just say  New York, let's just say Boston, let's just say Buffalo, bored out of their minds, getting  into trouble because they don't have these violent video games?  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Give us our violent video games.  Absolutely.  They're fun, fun, fun.  All right, well.  I can't wait.  We're getting them soon, I hope.  I think 8 o'clock we get our copies, something like that.  8 o'clock?  I believe so.  I think I'm feeling a little ill today.  I don't know if I'm going to make the XM portion of the show.  I got GTA-itis.  Yes.  Kenny's coming up with celebrity gossip.  Oh, is he? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, Kenny's going to be our morning.  Can't wait.  Not right now, Kenny.  What are you doing?  Are you ready?  No.  You're ready.  News weather and gossip on the 8s.  No, we're doing that next break.  We've got to compete with these morning zoos, so you're going to be instrumental in us competing  with the morning zoos out there.  So just read your copy.  And he puts the mental in instrumental.  That's right.  That's right.  Changing gears.  We have so much going on, so we're all over the ball field today, but that's okay.  Oh, good gravy.  Reverend Wright is... 
[00:59:00]  Jimmy, once again, let's set it up here.  You think he's ruining Obama's chances of becoming the President of the United States, right?  Yeah, of course he is.  He's doing exactly...  He's self-destructing just on the NAACP.  And there's this weird vibe in the black community.  And you could tell me I'm a racist or I'm crazy, but it's not white people sinking this  one.  And it's amazing.  I watched the way at the NAACP dinner, how they all stay.  They love him.  They love Reverend Wright.  And no one is saying, hey, dummy, just shut up until this guy gets the nomination. 
[00:59:30]  There's no bigger picture at all.  Do you think black people in general are self-destructive when it comes to this?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, why would the NAACP think this is okay for Reverend Wright to be...  We watched it yesterday on CNN and all the news channels covered him live.  And how does that help Obama in the end?  I think it's because they're under this impression that he should be able to say whatever he damn  well pleases because he is a powerful, educated, black man, Reverend Wright. 
[01:00:00]  And they don't understand, like Jimmy said, the bigger picture.  Yes, he does have a right to say this, to say whatever he wants.  But he's hurting the only black candidate, the only viable black candidate that this country  has ever seen.  And it's like, of course you have the right to say, but why wouldn't you just wait?  Like, why can't anybody...  Like, at the NAACP, what, are you afraid of becoming irrelevant? 
[01:00:30]  Is that what you're afraid of?  Is there that little thing in you that's a little afraid of becoming slightly irrelevant?  Yeah.  The Democrats in general are doing a horrible job, too.  Oh, they're awful.  Because at this point, they should have, like, got together and said, look, one of you guys,  probably Hillary, you got to drop out for the sake of the party at this point.  Which is smart not to, because let's just watch the self-destructing.  Yeah.  Yes.  Now she might.  I think she knows.  Maybe that's why she refuses to go away.  Tony Jersey, what's up?  Tony. 
[01:01:00]  Tony Jersey.  Tony.  Yo.  Yes.  Let's go, Tony.  We got a very busy show.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't aware you were calling me Tony today.  Oh.  Listen, I was...  What's your...  What's my real name?  Yeah.  Anyway.  Khalid.  Okay.  So why would I call you Tony?  I don't know you.  Whatever.  That's the name you gave.  All right.  Listen, I agree with you guys that Reverend Wright is hurting the cause. 
[01:01:30]  And I was about to say, you know, we shouldn't attach Reverend Wright and Al Sharpton to a  Barack Obama.  But now, after hearing what you and Jimmy were just saying, I'm sorry, Anthony and Jimmy  were saying, I agree with you.  He is hurting the cause.  And he's just making it harder and harder for anybody to see the black man over the fact  that he's just simply Barack Obama.  This will be used as, believe me, as a huge campaign tool for McCain if Obama gets the 
[01:02:00]  nomination.  They will drag out footage of Reverend Wright with Obama, play quotes from him, have it  up on the screen.  I could see the campaign ad in my head already.  I know what it's going to look like.  Grainy black and white, slow motion to make him look more evil.  And it's just going to be Reverend Wright and Obama, arms around each other, smiling with  quotes that Reverend Wright said, being tied to Obama.  That's exactly what McCain's going to use. 
[01:02:30]  He's on a media tour.  Yeah.  Like, instead of just laying low and saying, look, this guy is going to get the nomination  for president, he's on a media tour.  Yeah.  It's, it's, he knows this is his shot at fame and fortune.  He doesn't give a crap.  You can't think, I can't imagine that he really cares about Obama.  He couldn't, he's playing it up for the cameras.  He is loving it.  Let's go to Craig in New York.  Craig.  Good morning, Nagel Dix.  How are you?  What's up, man? 
[01:03:00]  I just want to, I just want to weigh in.  I know, but it's funny.  It is funny.  I'm this so-called preacher man.  Yeah.  Uh, you know, even though he's, he's all over the map and he doesn't make much sense,  I kind of blame the media for giving this guy a platform for his rhetoric.  Yes, and, yeah.  The media.  Yeah, but you can't, you can't expect the media to do the responsible thing.  The media's going to jump on this.  Of course they are.  This is custom made for them.  It's sound bites.  It's controversial.  It's racial. 
[01:03:30]  It's made for them.  And that doesn't explain why the NAACP makes him the featured speaker or a speaker at a  dinner or why he's going on this, on, on this media blitz.  They're just dummies for, for doing that.  But this is the same media that harps you guys.  This is the same media that got I miss fired.  You're right.  Then be smart and know how it works.  The media will never do the right thing.  They stink.  And I'm surprised Sharpton hasn't chimed in that much.  Well, he has on the Sean Bell verdict because Barack called and asked to be kind of, you 
[01:04:00]  know, a call for calm or whatever and Sharpton saying, and he's performing in front of white  people.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Well, because Reverend Al ran for president and it was a joke because he's an extremist,  a separatist, a racist.  And he doesn't want to see a black leader in this country that's a true black leader.  A black guy is killed, one of the cops or two of the cops that shoots are black, but  all of a sudden, Barack is grandstanding in front of white people. 
[01:04:30]  Because he's not taking the same tact on the shooting that Sharpton took, he's grandstanding  for white people.  So with black people-  Wait, who said that today?  Sharpton.  Reverend Al.  He's grandstanding for white people.  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  Congratulations.  We got someone defending Reverend Wright.  We got Jason in Pennsylvania.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, I was just watching CNN yesterday and it just seemed like, you know, I know we  see all the snippets on YouTube and, you know, whatever, but it seemed like once he explained 
[01:05:00]  himself, you know, it made a little more sense to, you know, what he was saying.  I'm not defending all his comments, but it just seemed like he made a little more sense  yesterday once you got to hear, you know, extend a version of what he actually had to  say.  Yes, like when he said Obama is, he goes, Barack, he goes, well, he's speaking like a politician.  That's never used as a compliment.  That's saying he's being phony and backing, backing out.  The Reverend Wright is just defending himself, his own ego.  He's not looking at a bigger picture.  And he's saying that Barack is being a politician when he says that. 
[01:05:30]  He's basically saying, look, Barack knows what I'm saying, but he's being phony.  That's what Wright is saying.  And these guys just don't work together in the media.  Reverend Al Sharpton is all about himself.  Reverend Wright is all about himself.  Yep.  It's amazing that NAACP is all about their organization.  All about themselves.  They care more about the NAACP than getting Obama elected.  But bury the N-word.  That's a good thing to do.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a ceremony.  What's that?  Once again, you have the media spinning it, you know, like you see little snippets and,  you know, the media takes, you know, five seconds. 
[01:06:00]  You guys know all about it.  Yes.  Five seconds.  Well, not yesterday.  They ran Reverend Wright's speech at the NAACP in its entirety.  We were watching it over at XM.  We had to give up on it.  Every news channel had it.  MSNBC, CNN, Fox, you know, go through the channels.  It was on everywhere.  Yes.  You're right about the news snippets, but there's so much material on this guy.  You can get more than a snippet.  You can get everything you can say.  Believe me.  Right.  That's all I got.  Punch it up, boys.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:06:30]  Let's say hi to Eric in Colorado.  He's a regular to the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you, Eric?  Morning, boys.  Hey, Anthony, NRA member.  Have you got the memo from the NRA about Obama's stance on guns?  I certainly have, and I'm disgusted with Obama's gun policies.  They're awful.  He's, yes, sir?  He's calling for a complete federal ban on all concealed carry permits.  Yep. 
[01:07:00]  He's calling for a complete federal ban on all automatic weapons, a complete federal ban on the sale and transfer of semi-automatic handguns and rifles, which is pretty much everything.  That's everything.  What, are you going to go back to a musket?  That's pretty much what he wants.  Obama!  Ugh, Obama.  Get out of here.  Yeah, his gun control.  And he's trying to come across as a guy that isn't out to take away your Second Amendment right. 
[01:07:30]  Well, and if you guys need to get the story about him when he was in the Illinois Senate regarding, basically supporting home invasions.  Because he didn't want a homeowner to be able to defend himself.  Right, right.  I remember that.  Some guy had a home invasion happen to him.  Because you're not allowed to own a gun in the county he was in, he defended himself and was prosecuted for having a gun. 
[01:08:00]  And they put the screws to him.  And Obama was part of that.  But they tried to pass legislation to change that law.  Obama voted against it.  Voted against it.  It's frightening.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Eric.  We've got to go to another regular.  Malik in Asbury Park.  I'm amazed you still listen to this show, Malik.  How are you?  Yo, come on, man. 
[01:08:30]  Y'all know y'all my niggas.  Hi, Malik.  I hear you, bro.  How's that Asbury Park?  Hold on.  We need to get Asbury Park updates.  Because what a hellhole when we went down there last time.  Yeah, you know, we're still killing, still murdering, still raping.  It ain't nothing different.  You know what I'm saying?  It is what it is.  What about that boardwalk area?  Are they starting to build that up or no?  Well, the thing was, they started doing construction on it, started building up, trying to revitalize  the whole town, and all of a sudden, it's like it became a cease and desist with, you 
[01:09:00]  know, building.  So all this stuff that they started building, it's just, just shells.  They didn't finish it.  They just stopped building?  Yeah, they just stopped building.  Oh, my God.  What a nightmare this area is.  Malik, I picture you as like an Omar type of person.  Nah, come on, man.  I came on TV show.  Y'all remember me.  It was sick.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't remember you.  We don't remember half the people that do our show.  I'm sorry, Malik.  What do you got on this one?  Yeah, but listen, man.  I agree with you and what you guys are saying with ONA and Jim, what you're saying about 
[01:09:30]  as far as what Reverend Wright is saying coming out right now.  Yo, he should be real low-key about, you know, about some of the things he's saying because  Obama does have a real good chance of becoming a president.  But the stuff that he is saying, yo, you got to give it to the man.  He's dropping jewels.  Yo, first of all, white America, middle America has no idea of what the black church is about.  And he's giving insight to what a lot of black churches are about. 
[01:10:00]  It's like black America, urban America doesn't know what Roman Catholic churches are about.  You know, they go into church, they start seeing people singing, oh, they get scared.  It's like you guys don't know what it's about when you see a reverend speak with a lot of emphasis.  You know what I'm saying?  Don't stop.  Like, even though you're right, Malik, like he is, I'm not saying Wright is doing anything  wrong other than the, like, look, he's just saying what he says.  But it's like just to now go on a media tour, instead of just shutting up and looking at  the bigger picture, like imagine if Hillary's priest or whatever came out and was bad-mouthing 
[01:10:30]  Jews or saying things anti-Jewish and then went on a tour and started defending why the  Jews were a problem.  And why?  Now I have a problem.  Who do I vote for?  But you know what I mean?  Instead of just, instead of just laying low, the NAACP puts the guy on a national stage.  The guy goes on a media blitz, not caring that the bigger picture is that it's hurting  this candidate.  Because everyone loves the spotlight.  What do you think is going to be better for, you want to talk about self-esteem and 
[01:11:00]  image or whatever, kids growing up now seeing this image of Barack Obama in the White  House as a goal to aspire for, instead of just some rhetoric that you hear America talk  about, how you can do whatever you want to do?  No, I completely agree.  The time that he's coming out right now is basically self-destructive to Obama's campaign.  Very cool.  I mean, yo, just keep your mouth shut to the dudes in the presidency.  We're going to take our 40 acres and the mule when he gets in there.  Oh, boy.  This guy's doing a great job, too, huh? 
[01:11:30]  Malik rules, man.  Hey, Malik, we'll see you.  Take the 40 acres and the mule, huh?  We'll see you at the Stone Pony for the next Bruce Springsteen show.  Have a good day, all right?  Malik, everyone.  Same, Malik.  Asbury Park.  One more.  Cook in Queens.  How are you, Cook?  Cook.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  How are you?  What's up?  Listen, I want to know, how come all of a sudden now, like, Obie was right.  These are just people who are just looking for their spotlight.  Reverend Wright, everybody just sits there and just shouts rhetoric against the white  man, rhetoric against the white man, screaming, screaming, screaming. 
[01:12:00]  And nobody mentions our own problems and our own issues.  It's like, when these cats are doing this, white people get nervous, like something's  going to happen, but nothing never comes out of it.  Why are you even paying no mind?  It's not that anything bad is going to happen.  It's like, any time there's a campaign, you look for any insights into the candidate's  mindset, you know?  And when a guy is that close for 20 years, it could be an insight into his mindset.  I don't think anything bad is going to happen.  But what he's saying, he's not just saying things like America owes reparations. 
[01:12:30]  He's saying things like, in a way, the chickens come home to roost in a way America asked for  9-11.  That's what chickens come home to roost means.  You put it out there and it came back to you.  And he's saying things like, America started AIDS to hurt black people.  He's not just saying 40 acres and a mule.  He's not just saying...  But since the death of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, you had a bunch of these phony, quote,  leaders coming through, been spelling the same nonsense for years.  Why even still pay attention to it?  It's like some chick you don't even want to deal with no more. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, but...  Because in Obama, there's a viable black candidate for the presidency of the United States.  For him to be tied to a guy that is spewing this rhetoric that in the black community is  fine, but white people, especially in middle America, look at it like, oh boy, oh, they're  at it again.  But what you feel to understand is, that's a small pocket of the black community.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  The media is blowing it up out of control and out of proportion. 
[01:13:30]  I mean, it's the same way when some white man get on there and suddenly says something  racist, like when I am, the whole situation I am is, now everybody's lumping together  every single crazy, quote, white shock jock together.  You know what I'm saying?  But the difference is, though, and this is, you're right, except for the fact it's not  just an isolated guy.  It's like the NAACP is making him the featured speaker of the dinner.  And when has the NAACP really been relevant to the black community?  Honestly.  That I honestly don't know.  I mean, you haven't, and freaking, since they got rid of Cole Black. 
[01:14:00]  But they're the official representative.  When the media wants to talk to somebody, they go to the NAACP.  And they understand the impact they have.  They do understand the media impact they have.  They've been around too long to not understand.  We're talking more perception than reality here also.  You know, this can be twisted around and used against Obama, and it will be.  This guy should know this and maybe keep his mouth shut for a while.  That's all. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  All right.  All right, boys.  Thank you, Cook.  See you, man.  Bye later.  I think we all are.  Your son.  We're all looking at this campaign very differently, all three of us.  It's amazing.  In the end, I don't really give a crap who's in office, because I truly don't think anything  drastically changes.  No, I know.  That's why I said we all have a different outlook on what's going on.  I'm officially behind McCain now.  Not that there was any real doubt in it.  And believe me, it's not like I'm woo-hoo McCain.  Yeah.  But with Hillary or Obama as the other choices, I can't even go there. 
[01:15:00]  For them to make me vote Republican again, these goddamn Democrats, these stupid effing  Democrats, they force me to vote Republican when I really don't want to, because their  agenda is the same every single goddamn election.  You can't have one Democrat go in there and have ideas that don't fit the whole party line.  You can't take one from column A, one from column B. 
[01:15:30]  You've got to take their whole stupid agenda, which I can't do.  I'm sorry.  I'm all for the woman's right to have an abortion.  The Republicans, of course, they don't want that.  So I'm not a Republican party line guy.  There's a lot of instances where stuff like that comes up.  But it seems like you've got to vote for people that have to go with the party line,  100 percent.  You know, why can't you have a Democratic candidate that is pro-Second Amendment? 
[01:16:00]  Why can't you have a Republican candidate that is for a woman's right to choose?  It just it's unbelievable that we have to vote for people and take all of their crap.  You know, I'd love for a candidate to be strong enough, strong willed enough to say,  no, I know this is the party I belong to, but here's my ideology.  Here's what I believe in.  Here's what I want to get across. 
[01:16:30]  Now, those days are long gone.  Gone.  Long, long gone.  All right.  We're going to get into other things after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Shue.  We just got a report that Laszlo had the game in our hands in, what, 15, 20 minutes.  Nice.  GTA 4, our copies.  We're in the damn game.  We should have had copies waiting for us on our desks when we got here at 5 this morning.  I just want to address this guy, Evan, from Texas, because I think a lot of people are confused. 
[01:17:00]  Evan?  Yes, sir.  Hi, sir.  What is your question?  Well, actually, it's not a question, but McCain's been one of the most anti-gun Republicans there has ever been.  I mean, he's had a D rating from the NRA, so don't think that just by voting for him that you're salvaging your gun rights,  because he's definitely one to go across party lines and do that.  I mean, he's done stuff that was anti-gun show, not to mention the McCain-Feingold stuff that's pretty much 
[01:17:30]  an abridgment of the freedom of speech.  He's going to prevent organizations such as the NRA from saying what they want to say within 30 days of an election.  I just don't know.  Well, the NRA is a little fanatical as far as guns go, but, of course, they're the National Rifle Association.  The only thing that is a little iffy on McCain's side is he wants to ban cheap guns like Saturday  night specials, but he wants to prosecute criminals, not citizens, for gun ownership. 
[01:18:00]  He doesn't want to hold gun manufacturers liable for crimes.  He opposes restrictions on assault weapons and ammunition types.  Yeah, but he also tried to close the so-called gun show loopholes and basically tried to make  private person-to-person gun transactions illegal.  Oh, no, so you should be able to just deal guns whenever you want.  That is kind of a thing I could see him getting behind.  Not that I agree with it or not, but believe me, it's leaps and bounds ahead of what Hillary 
[01:18:30]  or Obama would say he voted against the Brady bill.  He always said guns, the violence is a problem, not the guns.  Punish criminals who abuse Second Amendment rights.  This guy, he's a lot more pro-Second Amendment than any other candidate out there.  Yeah, I would agree with you there.  He's probably the lesser of three evils when he wants to solve that. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  Bring back Ronald Reagan.  Thank you, Ash.  Well, Ronald Reagan banned machine guns.  I'm just saying, in general, he was an amazing president.  Amazing.  I need a machine gun.  One more call, then we're going to move on to celebrity gossip with Club Soda Kenny today.  Ebony in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, I'm just calling to say that I'm not voting for Hillary or Obama.  I'm voting for McCain, and as a black female, I think a lot of people find that pretty interesting.  Yeah, but how black are you? 
[01:19:30]  Name's Ebony.  I'm black enough.  I live in Trenton.  I think that's pretty black.  And her name's Ebony.  Why would you vote for McCain?  What gets you going that way?  Well, really, I'm a fiscal Republican.  I like what they do with my money more so than anything else.  Say, professional woman, are you, Ebony?  Yes.  On what corner?  I didn't mean like that.  What?  What happened?  I didn't mean like that.  You said professional woman. 
[01:20:00]  What am I supposed to do?  No.  With the gun thing, I have two guns in my house.  My husband takes me to the shooting range, and if someone breaks into my house, and my  husband's not there, and it's me and my kids, I'm going to shoot first, ask questions  later.  There you go.  I don't want somebody telling me that I'm going to go to jail because I shot someone  protecting my family.  Exactly.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Or try to take away the right to defend yourself like that.  My God.  What was the image when she said she goes to the gun range?  I'm thinking Afro just rocking. 
[01:20:30]  She's got her boobs up and just on display.  Like, what's her name?  That broad from all the movies.  Pam Greer.  Yeah.  I'm thinking Pam Greer.  Yeah.  At the shooting range.  Ebony is just rocking it.  Give me another target, sugar.  Sugar?  That's exactly the picture.  That's me to a T.  Yeah.  Oh, I mean, that is a turn-on for a little white boy when he was growing up.  That Pam Greer, wow. 
[01:21:00]  All right, Ebony, thanks.  All right, bye.  Another faithful listener checking in.  I recognize these people.  All right, you want to do a little celebrity gossip, Anthony?  Oh, who doesn't?  Well, the ratings came out for New York City, and your pals.  Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton, we didn't do too well.  But it's very confusing because last week, corporate was calling all of us and high-fiving.  High-five.  Oh, very nice.  They were really, really happy with us because there's a new rating system that's going to  affect in the fall, but they could already look at it, and advertisers are kind of looking 
[01:21:30]  at it as well.  They're all kind of focusing their attentions on the new way they're going to do things.  And in that world, we do very well.  Yeah.  The old world, where you have to actually write down your favorite radio show and all  that crap, we didn't do so well.  So now we're like, what the hell's going on?  Which one do you believe?  Thank God the old way is going, you know, is leaving us.  The old ways.  But the paper has a big article in the ratings here in New York, and this stupid morning 
[01:22:00]  zoo is completely killing, this Elvis Duran, completely killing, and they don't really  do much on their show that's interesting.  They don't have political discussions like we do.  They don't get edgy, or they're not funny people.  Well, they get listeners.  But they play a lot of pop songs that are very, very popular, and then they do very  safe, you know, easy radio, and that's what's killing here in New York City.  So we're taking a little piece of their show and bringing it to our show today.  Why not?  If it works. 
[01:22:30]  You know, and we found out they do a segment called Celebrity Sleaze.  Is it Iraq?  Yeah.  All right.  So we got our own version of Celebrity Sleaze today with Club Soda Kenny.  And now it's time for Celebrity Gossip.  Celebrity Gossip.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, Club Soda Kenny.  How are you today?  Good morning, all.  Oh, gosh.  It's Club Soda Kenny.  Keep your energy up because people like that in the morning.  Hi-oh! 
[01:23:00]  A lot of pressure on the clubby, but he can handle it now.  Oh, good gosh.  The clubby.  Oh, is he something?  What are you, a comedian?  Come on.  Hi-oh!  Hey, do you guys like Carmen Electra?  Hey, that Carmen Electra, huh?  Hubba hubba hubba.  I say.  Oh, I sure do like her.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, me too.  Attention, farmers.  Kenny Chesney injured his foot when it got caught between the stage and a platform at a concert the other night.  Oh, that had to hurt.  Oh, I hope he's feeling all right. 
[01:23:30]  I guess he was singing, Fall in Love.  Or maybe he might have been singing, When I Closed My Eyes.  No, you didn't, Kenny.  But he should have been singing, Never Gonna Feel Like That Again.  He's got wings.  Oh, it's the froggy.  Do you guys like Kate Hudson?  Oh, boy, do I, Kenny.  Hey, hubba hubba.  She's a looker.  She just turned 29 the other day. 
[01:24:00]  She did?  Yeah.  God, that's 14 years too old for Anthony.  I hear you.  Oh, good gosh.  Now stop it.  What do you got on Kate Hudson?  That's it.  What?  She turned 29.  It's a little birthday thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  They do celebrity birthdays, and that's all they got?  And, of course, today is a wedding anniversary for Hitler and Ava Braun.  Really?  God bless.  Do you want to say that?  Wish them, uh, well, they're dead.  Yeah.  And many more. 
[01:24:30]  Elliot Spitzer's whore, Ashley Dupree, is suing Girls Gone Wild because they re-released  a 2003 video she was in.  Oh.  Yeah, this whore says that she's not being, no, strike that.  This whore says that she is being exploited without proper compensation.  Ah, she just wants some cash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know how those debutantes operate.  Of course.  Is that a debutante?  Oh, that's funny, calling her a debutante. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, a little spin on the whole thing.  Yeah.  I got a little confused.  Oh, Kenny.  You know, Scott Weiland's going to jail because of his second DWI.  Uh-oh, it could be the Grand Theft Auto things.  But you're in the middle of your celebrity gossip.  Hold on.  Yeah, but this is important.  Hello?  Is this Carrie?  The Grand Theft Auto girl?  Are you here? 
[01:25:30]  All right, I'm doing celebrity gossip.  I'll be there in a minute.  Don't go anywhere.  All right, please.  I'm doing celebrity gossip.  Nobody believes me.  All right, bye.  All right.  That's the GTA girl?  Yeah.  All right, finish up your celebrity gossip so we can get our games.  All right, where was I?  Scott Weiland going to jail for a second DWI.  Hit it, E-Rock.  T-P-A.  Hey, what?  What are you doing?  That's a little intro for the band. 
[01:26:00]  That's a little too much production for your dumb segment.  Nice.  Yeah.  Hey, have you guys heard about Madonna's new album, Hard Candy?  No, I haven't, Kenny.  Me neither.  Hey.  Oh, gosh.  I wonder if it sucks.  You know, candy sucks.  Oh, Froggy.  Froggy.  Froggy.  You're crazy.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, Froggy, just go out and buy it.  Oh, guys.  But anyway, I got another big story.  Do you?  Do you know that Pamela Anderson has something in common with Opie and Jimmy? 
[01:26:30]  Oh.  Oh, what's that?  Hepatitis?  No.  Hey.  That's just Jimmy.  Yeah.  No, Jimmy's clean.  We're bad babysitters?  No.  No, Pam was in D.C. last week and she visited the famous exorcist stairs in Georgetown.  Oh.  We did that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And do you know that Pamela Anderson, she was Canadian, but now she's a U.S. citizen?  I did not know that, Kenny.  Didn't know that. 
[01:27:00]  See, that's a good gossip report.  Pamela Anderson?  I know.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Maybe she changed her name, too.  Who knows?  Uh-oh.  Oh, wait.  The phone's ringing again.  Who's this?  Oh, boy.  Don't leave.  Hello?  You're in the middle of your gossip.  That's Frank Arbitron.  Who's this?  Zero.  Zero point zero.  Wrong number.  Wrong number?  You're in the middle of your celebrity gossip.  I know.  I can't help it.  It's just in.  Wrong number.  All right.  Finish strong.  Finish strong.  All right.  All right.  Did you hear about the alleged Roger Clemens affair with Mandy McGreeby? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's very inappropriate, by the way.  It's not really alleged at this point, Kenny.  Talk about pitching and catching.  What?  I don't really get that.  What'd you say?  Talk about pitching and catching.  You know, because, like, he's a pitcher, and he's having an affair with her.  I think he throws fastballs. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  And that's been your gossip report with Club Soda Kenny.  Back to the funny guys.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Wow.  Kenny's working on a new segment called When Bad Things Happen to Good People.  When is that going to be on the show?  Hopefully by Friday?  Yeah.  Maybe we'll do, like, a Friday recap.  Of all the things that happen to good people?  Yeah.  It's called When Bad Things Happen to Good People.  To Good People.  With Club Soda Kenny. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  As only I can do it.  And, of course, another segment of Traffic and Weather Together on the 8th.  What?  Maybe tomorrow?  Whenever you like.  I always got Traffic and Weather.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  No, thank you.  No, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No, thank you.  Kenny, go get our effing games, will you?  All right.  Hey, where's that Reverend Al story before we take a break?  Very interesting.  This is from the paper this morning.  The Reverend Al Sharpton.  Yep.  Who, he wants to shut down New York City.  Do we know anything about that?  Still in the planning stages. 
[01:29:00]  Don't have a date when he wants to do this, but he does indeed want to shut down New York City  in protest of the Sean Bell police officer.  I'll get a lot of people on his side, I'm thinking.  Oh, of course it will.  Well, the Reverend Al Sharpton may have felt something like the stoners in the film, dude, where's my car?  When he emerged from a meeting in Queens yesterday with Republican John Conyers, who's a Democrat from Michigan,  and found his 2007 Jaguar missing. 
[01:29:30]  Turns out it had been tagged for some $900 in tickets and towed.  Good.  First of all, how's this ass driving around in a Jaguar?  Guaranteed it's not in his name.  It's probably loaned to him.  Of course.  Yeah, the last line here, it's not clear who owns the car.  Of course, it's not clear.  It is through these shyster deals that he does through his stupid action network.  Just, you know, the guy is a, I can't even say it. 
[01:30:00]  No, and it isn't even the N-word.  He's walking with the less fortunate, and he's driving around in a 2007 Jaguar.  Wearing great suits.  Just, you know, what happened to the man of the people?  Stop driving your Jag.  How great is that, though?  The car was towed.  Good.  I wonder who had that towed.  All the cops were just following him around.  Hey, a few tickets on this one.  Tagged for some $900 in tickets.  Yeah.  I'll park wherever I want.  Will ya? 
[01:30:30]  Dude, where's my car?  Good.  Let's play the Reverend Al song as we go to break.  On the way, these morning zoos do, like, stupid news and silly news.  We got a silly lampshade story that we're going to finally get to.  And some, oh, and the seven-year-old stealing grandma's SUV is getting a lot of attention today.  So, still lots of radio to do on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the Kugler's clan? 
[01:31:00]  Yelling and a-screamin' as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's sappin' off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always pickin' on me?  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry. 
[01:31:30]  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The portly little reverend with an ass just like a bus.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always pickin' on me?  Remember Bertie Getz in the Brawley case?  Turn on the TV, you would always see his face. 
[01:32:00]  He's speedin' in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  On the never-ending search for some good publicity.  Why is the white man always pickin' on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al. 
[01:32:30]  He's coming right.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge the fee.  Now, as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  He's your pal.  That's right, Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's a race, fake, white, hate, beggar, follow me.  Now, why is the white man always pickin' on me?  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al. 
[01:33:00]  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  It's a very exciting day on the Opie and Anthony show.  GTA 4 comes out today.  A lot of people have already gotten the game.  Stores have been open since midnight.  We're all in the game.  Simple as that.  We're all in the game.  And, Clubby, what?  You just kind of jumped over my whole little thing.  Well, I'm excited.  You're very excited.  What's up? 
[01:33:30]  I'm excited for you.  I have a big presentation to make, but you're doing the big buildup.  Go ahead.  Yeah, but you wrecked my buildup by going, hey!  Because you have really bad timing.  No, I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  You were saying GTA?  Before GTA, uh...  Wow, you really threw me off, man.  It's okay.  I do want to bring to everyone's attention that you're fighting the phone company, though, 
[01:34:00]  which I think is horrific.  Yeah, I don't like that business.  Kenny decided to finally get, like, a BlackBerry.  Really?  He was old school until, I think, last week, where now he could check his email on the  fly, like most human beings these days.  Right.  And, you know, Kenny does a lot for this radio show, a lot for Jimmy, when Jimmy's on tour.  And you needed a BlackBerry or an iPhone, like, years ago.  I was holding out.  You certainly were.  But you finally got one.  And why don't you tell Jimmy and Anthony why you were on the phone with the phone company? 
[01:34:30]  Just say, the phone company, for hours yesterday.  Listen to this one.  But there's some logic to what he's saying.  Well, can I say the company name?  Because it's part of the thing.  There's two company names as part of the thing.  Oh, Jesus.  You're guaranteed one's a sponsor.  That's what I'm thinking.  What is the issue?  All right.  The issue is, all right, in this new device that I have.  The BlackBerry.  When you send an email, it has an automatic signature that proclaims that this email was sent 
[01:35:00]  from BlackBerry from the certain phone company service provider by the certain brand of the  thing.  Gotcha.  Right.  Okay.  But, you know, he was telling me this this morning.  He spent hours with this issue on the phone yesterday.  I'm like, damn, Kenny's on to something.  Yeah, because first of all.  You're not a spokesperson for this phone company? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Like, that is automatically sent on every email you send.  So I'm thinking, now follow me, Anthony.  I'm following.  First of all, I don't want people to know that they can have immediate access to me because  I got one of these things now.  Too late because we're talking about it on the air, but go ahead.  Right.  Second of all, I am not paid to neither advertise nor endorse those two companies.  Uh-huh.  So I don't want it on there. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  He brings up a great point because we all pay ridiculous cell phone bills.  Yeah.  It costs me another $50 a month to get the thing.  We're all in the same boat as you, Kenny.  So you pay these ridiculous cell phone bills, and then on top of it, you're advertising for  that provider every time you send an email out.  And no way to shut that off?  No.  That's what he was trying to get done yesterday.  I was on the phone for a god-awful long time.  I'm sure that's what the other person on the side of the phone was saying.  The other person was from Idaho, and he had nothing better to do. 
[01:36:30]  If I tell you the corny joke he told me while he was trying to figure this whole thing out.  What was the joke?  What was it?  It's ridiculous.  All right?  All right.  Strap in.  How do you fit 10 cows in seven boxes, and you can't eat them or cut it up?  Wait, wait.  Ask a couple of them to share boxes?  That was my first guess, too.  But it's wrong.  10 cows.  10 cows in seven boxes? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Without cutting them up?  Or eating them.  Or eating them.  How big is each box?  It doesn't matter.  Put them all in one and have six leftover boxes.  Jimmy, you got a paper and pen in front of you?  I do.  All right.  Would you draw seven boxes?  I know.  This was supposed to be a 10-second bit.  Now we're drawing on radio?  Just real fast.  Draw.  All right.  All right.  He made you draw the seven boxes at home?  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  No, he didn't.  Yeah.  Believe me.  This guy.  All right.  So now you drew the seven boxes?  Hold on a second.  All right.  Jimmy, very annoyed, but doing what Kenny said, and he's drawing the seven boxes.  Okay.  The seven boxes are wrong.  All right.  Now spell out 10 cows in the seven boxes.  What?  T-E-N-C-O-W-S.  How about if I just spell out asshole once? 
[01:38:00]  Wait.  So what was the setup line again for that joke?  How do you fit 10 cows in seven boxes without like cutting them up or eating them or anything?  And then you draw the seven boxes and then you spell out 10 cows?  Yeah.  Why not 30 cows in two boxes?  How about 1,575 cows in 11 boxes?  This guy stinks.  Hey, he's from Idaho.  Alex in Boston has help for you.  Alex, what's up?  Hey, you should be able to log on to whoever that provider's website is into your profile 
[01:38:30]  and change the bottom.  The bottom of that eye email.  I would think.  A lot of people say it's as easy as just finding the website.  Yeah, it's very easy.  It takes about a minute.  All right.  And how many hours were you on?  I was an hour and a half with this guy last night.  And he's like researching things.  He's calling his boss.  He was calling his boss.  But you know, you bring up a great point.  You're not a spokesperson for the phone company.  You just want to send your dumb email.  Yeah.  You're already paying for their service. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Let them pay me to advertise and endorse their products.  All right.  Very good.  Because I'm Club Soda Kenny, damn it.  Did you ask about the extra charges and all the surcharge?  Did you ask about that stuff too?  No.  He's just from Idaho.  Oh, he's like a small man on the top.  Can we have our games, Kenny?  Yes.  I hold in my hands the new GTA 4.  Yes.  We have a PS3.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  We have an Xbox for Anthony. 
[01:39:30]  Oh.  And we have a PS3 for Jim.  Thank you very much.  Very nice.  There it is.  There it is.  In our hands.  Ready to go.  Oh, wow.  All right.  We will be back tomorrow with the Opie and Anthony show.  No, we should have done.  We should have set up three TVs at XM with the game and see who could play the best.  Hey, Laszlo, calling from London.  They got you all over the world, huh?  Yeah, I came over here for the midnight store launch.  Oh.  Isn't it like afternoon time now there? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, it is.  But at midnight last night, there was like a thousand people lined up outside of a game  store.  Wow.  And there's no open container law over here.  So everybody's just drinking and throwing their beers on the ground.  Of course.  Absolutely drunk.  Including Laszlo.  Including me.  Yeah, I was pretty ass-faced in line.  It was a good vibe.  You should be.  You haven't really seen sunlight in the last year or so, huh?  Yeah, exactly.  You've been working around the clock getting this game out. 
[01:40:30]  Well, the best part was we decided the game store that we went to was in like the Mastic  Beach of London.  It was like proper soccer hooligans, you know, that like sort of get rough with their women  and call them names in public.  Nice.  Soccer the hooligans.  So there's a thousand people online.  Did the game store have enough games?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I, um, I'm hearing, I'm hearing rumors that we sold anywhere from one to two mil or something  like that.  Already? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  And they're saying, uh, you guys are going to sell nine million by the end of the week?  Yeah, I don't, I hope.  Who knows?  I don't know who came up with that statistic, but, uh, that'd be quite cool.  I heard a gazillion.  Yes.  Dude, nine, if you guys sell nine million, nine million in a week, and what's the average,  uh, price for the game?  50 or $60?  About 60 bucks.  So that's $540 million.  Yeah, well, we've also been in the hole for about four years while making this thing.  And, of course, the huge stipend we paid Anthony. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, wait, that was nothing.  Yep, yep, yep.  You know.  You got a lot of guys for free.  Yeah.  I got to get paid.  I'm pretty, I'm pretty psyched, though, because when you play the game and you go to your safe  house, you can sit down and watch television, and when you watch that television, you can  see the Pisswasser commercial that Anthony did the song for.  Very, very, uh, eager to see that.  Yeah, there's two in-game TV stations, so when you, uh, when you fail a mission and  you want to just go back and drink at your safe house crib, you can literally watch hours  of TV that we produced. 
[01:42:00]  And it's, it's, and it's, it's original hours, you know what I mean?  It's not like a five-minute loop or something like that?  No, no, no, it's all original content.  There's several shows.  There's like a cartoon that we did.  There's a, we did a spoof of those, uh, Rick Burns documentaries, um, called it.  Ken Burns?  Yeah, Ken Burns.  Well, he had his brother, too, right?  His brother, all right, okay.  He did the New York one, um, and it was the same vibe, just slow pans across pictures and  ridiculous comments.  Um, because there's so much content in this game, uh, you're going to be spending a lot 
[01:42:30]  of time doing, uh, a lot of other stuff other than just cracking open heads and shooting  and, uh, being with prostitutes.  Yeah, the, the, the guy at Wired said he was trying to find the bottom of the internet,  uh, and he just couldn't because there's an in-game internet with over a hundred sites  that we wrote, and it's all spoof content.  Wow.  That's unbelievable, man.  Yeah, and I can't believe Jimmy got a PS3, is this true?  Yeah, Jimmy, yeah.  Well, I'll tell you why I did, because I, I was out looking for, I wanted a Blu-ray  player, and, um, I, I can't buy an Xbox just for video games, because I honestly don't 
[01:43:00]  know, like, I may only play this one, and I wanted the Blu-ray player badly, so I bought  the PlayStation 3, because you can upgrade that one online as far as the Blu-ray capabilities  are concerned, and, um, I figure, look, if I fall in love with this game completely,  when the new updates come out in August, I can get an Xbox.  I mean, that's a few months away.  Right.  But is there any way the updates will go on PlayStation 3?  Uh, right now, it's only slated for, uh, for Xbox, but, you know, I would, I would hope  deep down that if, if it does really well on Xbox, maybe we'll end up doing something 
[01:43:30]  on, on PS3 with the downloadable content, but we're already cranking on, on that stuff.  There's, we're not even sort of resting.  We're already in production for the first, uh, bit of downloadable content.  Thank God.  When is that going to be available?  I think towards the end of the summer.  Wow.  And, uh, what's the special edition for Xbox?  Oh, it comes with this, like, lockbox and a, and a, and a duffel bag and a, and a, like,  behind-the-scenes art book that shows a lot of the sketches and stuff for the game characters, 
[01:44:00]  as well as, uh, a soundtrack of some of the music in the game.  Um, we were going to release all the music in the game, but there's over 200 tracks that  we licensed.  So, yeah, there's a, there's a lot of music in it, and it's cool.  Iggy pops the DJ on the rock station, and Juliette Lewis is sort of this spaced out, uh, DJ  on the modern rock station, so it came out nicely.  I got to work with a Scientologist, which is always cool.  Is there a special edition for Xbox 360 that costs a lot more money on Amazon?  Eric's asking. 
[01:44:30]  Yes, there is.  There's a special edition.  They were just asking, there's a special edition for, you can get for either Xbox or PS3  that comes with that, like, that, uh, lockbox and, and all the other materials that, that  costs more money.  Did he just say that?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, thanks for paying attention, Jim.  I'm looking at you confused, like, what's the difference between the special edition and  the one we have?  Uh, what, do you want me to explain it for the third time?  Okay.  Just goodies.  You have just the game. 
[01:45:00]  We have just the game for now.  It's little goodies and doodads.  Swag.  Don't worry about it.  This will preoccupy you for a while.  Oh, but it has to do with the game.  This is all that Jimmy's been talking about all morning.  When are we getting our games?  When are we getting our games?  I'm like, Jimmy, even if we get our games, we can't play them until we go home today.  I have couples therapy today.  I can play later.  Oh, no.  That should be fun, Jimmy.  You should blow off the couples therapy to play.  Anthony, I also wanted to let you know that they had a brewery over here, Bruce and Pisswasser.  Yeah.  And, I mean, it's got the bottles.  I was drinking loads of it last night. 
[01:45:30]  They actually, they got a pallet of it, and they were shipping it to New York, and Customs  turned it back.  Really?  Yeah, because it doesn't have all the proper stupid health warnings and stuff on that.  So, it's not even good for export.  No, it's not even good for export.  So, I'm going to try to smuggle some back on the plane.  Good luck there.  Yeah, that's smart to mention on a show that broadcasts internationally.  It's beer.  It's not like I'm smuggling, like, plutonium, for God's sake.  Yeah, I understand.  It's beer. 
[01:46:00]  It's just, you know, the ingredients on the back of the bottle say, you know, it's Bavarian  urine or something like that.  When do you come back, Laz?  I'm actually going up to Scotland for the big launch party tomorrow, because that's  where all the code is done in Scotland at Rockstar North, and then I'm back on Friday,  which is good, because I've been on the road for, like, since I saw you guys.  Yeah, that's what, almost two weeks ago.  Yeah, exactly.  I've been on, like, radio stations across the country, and I've got to tell you, a lot  of them stink. 
[01:46:30]  Why do they stink?  Because everything's about giveaways and stupid names and horns that they play, and  you know.  Well, we've been saying today, you're perfect for today's show, because, uh, what's his  name?  I swear to God, I forgot his name even.  Elvis Duran here in New York, uh, ratings came out, it's the number one show in America.  What?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  God.  And they do exactly what you just said, you know, fake, fake voices, and fake, uh, prank 
[01:47:00]  calls, and celebrity gossip, and playing pop songs, and a lot of noisemakers.  That's what, that's what America wants to hear these days.  Yeah, I was on one station where everybody would text in, uh, and vote for their favorite  high school, and I was like, wow, we are really taking advantage of this medium, aren't we?  It's worse than some of the parody stations in the game.  Oh, and it's so difficult to stay on top of parodying radio when it just keeps getting  worse out there.  Yeah.  It's just like, the guy Sean that I brought with me, you know, he's never really been 
[01:47:30]  exposed to radio, and he was like, wow, Opie and Anthony was the best one that we've  done.  All the rest of these guys are annoying.  And we're pretty annoying ourselves.  Yeah, but.  I think in a good way, though.  Yeah.  In like a real way.  But your show is real in an organic way.  I mean, people would just like, get all spazzled, like, guys, you've talked for more than  two minutes, and it's like, oh, sorry.  We've got to get to the entertainment reporter, the, give away some stupid ticket.  Yeah, it's bad. 
[01:48:00]  It's bad out there, gents.  Keep up, keep up the good fight.  All right, Laszlo, we'll see you soon.  Thanks for our games.  Yeah.  Congratulations on the ratings.  I mean, they said they've never seen ratings like this for a video game before.  Yeah, we've got 10 out of 10 from almost everybody.  There's a couple of people that just wanted to stand out and act moody and gave us like,  you know, 95 out of 100.  Yeah.  But the ratings have been amazing.  What was really great last night here in the London office, people in Australia had just  gotten the game in New Zealand and places like that, and were just hopping onto the multiplayer, 
[01:48:30]  and the guys here in the Rockstar London office were schooling them.  I mean, just sniping them, tearing them to pieces.  It was pretty hysterical to watch.  These guys have been playing the game for a year, and the newbies come in, and they just  mow them down.  I would have loved to have been in the room for that.  I never even thought of that.  Yeah, you guys got all the experts that have been playing it forever.  You got the newbies just getting started with multiplayer.  Yeah.  Anthony, I can't wait to play you online in this thing, dude.  Oh, I know.  I'm going to jump on. 
[01:49:00]  I want to, you know, get used to it a little, and then I'll jump online and get my ass handed  to me.  It'll be fun.  Can I play online, too?  Oh, boy, Jimmy, you can.  Yeah.  Jimmy, I don't know.  Can Jimmy play in the same network as us?  No.  No, of course not.  He won't be in the same network, but I will have to say I'm a little bit nervous about  Jimmy playing head-to-head because when somebody comes up and knifes him, I'm afraid Jimmy will  get angry.  Yeah, yeah.  You seem like the kind of guy that would get angry at another guy playing a game and just 
[01:49:30]  like completely schooling you.  Yeah, you have to realize you're going to die a lot, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's like performing.  Laszlo, a lot of people are saying that you sound nagel-faced.  What?  Oh, oh.  A lot of people are saying you sound nagel-faced.  What is nagel-faced?  Oh, so you've been gone too long.  Oh, yeah.  It's the new way to say the crap word, the S word.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we just say nagel now.  Yeah.  Like a big steaming pile of nagel. 
[01:50:00]  Nagel, you know.  No.  I mean, I did go to bed at three in the morning drunk, but...  Oh, okay.  You're fine then now.  Yeah, sure.  A few hours, you're good to go.  Yeah.  I'm just a bit hungover and I haven't eaten.  Yeah, what the hell time is it over there?  It's 1.35.  Oh, God.  Can we do English to England time today?  Hey.  London time and we can go home now?  Breaking news, by the way.  Finally, someone got it right as far as this show goes.  Special thanks to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:50:30]  Right there.  Wow.  The first one.  Not buried in the middle of the credits like Bob Kelly did to us.  Look at that.  Yeah, Bob Kelly stinks.  Top billing.  Special thanks to the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I made a point when they were doing the credits and they were doing the special thanks to list  you guys first.  That is really cool.  That is really cool of you, Laszlo.  Thank you so much.  Sure, man.  Well, thanks for all the support, guys, and thanks for all the great stuff you did.  I can't wait to play the game and buy porn from Jim.  Yeah, I know.  I just want to go around and go to the ammunition and see who's in there. 
[01:51:00]  Smells good.  The booklet smells good.  Absolutely.  I like the smell of a new book.  Laszlo, where are you off to now?  Oh, he's sitting there right now going, why?  I gave him the free game.  You know how Kenny just did celebrity gossip, Anthony?  Yeah.  Well, this is the Z100.  See, they shouldn't have gave us the games, because now we're all distracted looking at 
[01:51:30]  him.  Jimmy's going through the book.  Eh?  And we can't even play them.  The Rockstar girl is very attractive, by the way.  I was getting vibes off her.  You were getting vibes?  You want to ask her if she has something for you?  Nah, she's busy.  She ran away.  As soon as Laszlo was gone, she was gone.  She's on the ball.  So, getting back to this Elvis Duran and Z100 here in New York.  The number one morning show in New York City.  We've been taking a close look at them today.  And I got some celebrity gossip from them. 
[01:52:00]  They mentioned their celebrity sleaze.  The friendliest gossip segment to ever be called the sleaze, according to young Sam.  Sam?  Yeah, for a segment called The Sleaze, I thought they went out of their way to avoid sleaze  at all costs.  But maybe that was just me.  Yeah.  All right.  You ready to hear this, Ant?  Please.  There it is.  Let's get into the sleaze.  Danielle!  All right.  Well, Pete Wentz, he's not depressed.  He's from Fall Out Boy.  You know that.  And supposedly, he and his girlfriend, Ashley Simpson, sorry, fiancé, are expecting a baby. 
[01:52:30]  So, Pete gets up on stage in D.C. to the crowd, getting ready to perform.  And he says, I want to thank my girlfriend's vajayjay.  Wow.  Thank you, Pete Wentz.  I don't get these people, but hey, why not?  What?  You hear that, Jimmy?  What was that?  Yeah.  Jimmy's really distracted.  Why did we head out these games right now?  I'm looking at myself in the credits.  I know, but we're doing a radio show! 
[01:53:00]  Oh, okay.  What did I miss?  Just playing this audio is going to be, who gives a crap?  No, no.  What happened?  We all have ADD.  Why did we head out the games during the show?  Why?  Just for a second.  Why?  What happened?  Well, they told that, they did that stupid celebrity gossip thing, but there was nothing  nasty about it.  You were, you were, you were, they were saying vajayjay.  Vajayjay. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  By the way, if my computer at some point doesn't stop doing this on a daily basis, every day,  it will just turn itself off automatically.  Just shut itself off, turn itself back on, and nothing works.  That's, that's part of what's been going on here.  For months!  Fix it!  That computer's a real vajayjay.  A vajayjay.  That's right.  I bring it all back.  Fix the goddamn thing.  And then Mars has to come over from XM and put in some kind of magical code, or else nothing 
[01:54:00]  loads.  Now it's not recognizing the camera or anything else, or, I don't know.  What are they missing?  Us?  I don't know.  I brought it out.  No, but I, I, I can't get any comments.  Like, half of this stuff, what do you think, I'm brilliant?  Half of this stuff comes from Steve from Bayshore.  Ah, well, and you're, you're bummed about not being able to look at the beautiful girls.  Of course.  So you're distracted with the computer, as you're, Jimmy's reading credits, why are we  even playing this audio?  Why are we even playing it now?  I heard vajayjay. 
[01:54:30]  Because then it just becomes like, you know, someone else's show.  But we'll get the gossip.  Is this the gossip now?  We'll know what the gossip is, at least.  All right, here we go.  More, uh, they call it the celebrity sleaze?  Yes, the sleaze.  All right.  Uh, let's talk about American Idol.  Last Wednesday had its lowest rated episode in five years.  Now, Idol numbers are still huge.  We know that.  It's still a great show.  But producers are throwing around ideas on how to freshen it up.  One of the ideas is instead of showing us all that audition stuff that we can't stand, 
[01:55:00]  instead opening it with the Hollywood round and then throwing in some audition footage  here and there, which actually sounds a lot better to me.  I don't know about you guys.  Guys.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I don't know about you guys.  Guys.  This is the number one morning show in New York City.  Because people are driving going, oh, they are?  That's Idol?  Well, wait, now, I happen to like the audition process.  Oh, I wonder what Bob at work is going to say when I ask him if he likes that or not. 
[01:55:30]  What I'm learning today is we need to do more Who Cares Radio.  Oh.  This is Who Cares Radio.  Why am I so low on the radio?  You're in your car and you're listening to...  Oh my God, why?  Jimmy's bummed.  He's low in the credits.  Oh my God, why did we hand out these games?  Why, why, why?  Because it's the greatest game ever and now we have them.  It was supposed to be a dramatic thing.  Here's your games, guys.  I know what we should have done. 
[01:56:00]  We should have then, everyone hand them back to Kenny.  No one would have known and then leave them in the office till later.  What?  Yeah, they'd be there still.  Of course they would.  No, they wouldn't.  They'd be stolen.  So what you're hearing basically is Who Cares Radio.  No one is in their cars going, wow, oh, really?  Oh, wow.  Wow, that's really interesting.  Oh, so...  I've got to call Susie and discuss this further.  Yes, yes.  Did you hear what they said?  What do you think about this?  That's what they do.  Idol, did you hear what they're going to do next season?  Because the ratings are...  They're going to just show clips of the auditions. 
[01:56:30]  Why is this number one?  You're kidding.  Where'd you hear that?  Why is this number one?  I heard that on Elvis Duran.  Well, I listened.  I didn't hear that part.  Oh, but I was getting gas at the time.  Yes, maybe I was out of my vehicle.  Shut up.  Where's a gunman to walk through their place of work?  Vajayjay is an Oprah thing.  Vajayjay?  Oprah said Vajayjay, you know, because she was doing some edgy talk on her TV show.  Was she?  So now all these shows have adopted Vajayjay. 
[01:57:00]  Vajayjay.  Oof.  That is a lame-ass way to say, ah, ah.  We like to call it the whale's eye.  How about the smelly donkey mouth?  The Vajayjay.  Vajayjay.  They're number one in New York City, and they use stuff like Vajayjay.  Ugh.  And finally, the last bit of their celebrity sleaze today.  Just getting ratings, though.  You gotta give them that much.  And your Jonas Brothers. 
[01:57:30]  They're so sweet.  We love them.  People Magazine reporting that...  Do they hate anybody?  No.  They love the world.  They preface everything by, oh, we love them.  We love Idol, but we might have a little info here that might get you a little mad.  No.  But let's make sure we tell everyone we love you.  Nobody wants to listen to radio of people not liking people.  Really?  And your Jonas Brothers.  They're so sweet.  We love them.  People Magazine reporting that the Jonas Brothers we know earned 12 million bucks last year. 
[01:58:00]  And they did some nice things with their money.  They bought their mommy a diamond-encrusted watch.  And they gave 10% of their income to Nick's charity, Change for the Children Foundation.  So that's so cool.  It's nice when celebrities do cool things.  Change for the Children.  Do they just get quarters and nickels?  Oh, Froggy.  Hi-oh!  This is number one in New York.  Yeah.  Celebrities doing nice things for their mommies.  That's what's getting the job done. 
[01:58:30]  It's mind-boggling.  It really is.  It's mind-boggling.  That is who gives a S.  Who gives a Nagel radio?  Who gives a Nagel?  I guess Nagel does.  Oh, Nagel does.  Boy, does he hate that.  Oh, does he hate being called crap.  It's his family name, for God's sake.  Family crest.  I think I know Iraq, too.  If a show like this calls, oh, he is gone.  Oh, yeah.  He loves radio like this.  It fits right in. 
[01:59:00]  He'll leave us like that.  This is his dream.  He's a sex bagel again.  This is his dream, to be sex bagel and be part of this nonsense.  Why did they call you a sex bagel?  Can I ask that?  That thrilling story of nothingness.  Why?  Yeah, why do they call you a sex bagel?  Microphone.  Not important.  Not important.  It is important, Iraq.  Of course it is.  Yeah, come on.  Bestow that thrilling story upon our audience, could you please?  Someone misspoke at the college. 
[01:59:30]  Cares.  Shut up.  The college station at work?  How did they mix up sex bagel with incompetent?  Uh-oh.  No, he didn't.  I'm sorry, Iraq.  It's all right.  Yeah.  What was the story?  What?  They had sex with a bagel?  Oh, that's wild.  How about sex toast?  Sex English muffin.  What about sex muffin? 
[02:00:00]  So really, how did it start?  Do you really care?  Yeah, I kind of want to know.  I forgot the original story.  Shut up.  No, we do care.  I care, though.  Yeah, for Jimmy.  He doesn't care.  All right, go ahead.  I'll leave you alone.  For Jimmy.  There was a show that was trying to do like a Love Lines ripoff, and I was working the  board there, and the ass for...  Speaking of bored.  What?  You were what?  Like a Love Lines?  There was a show at that station that was a Love Lines ripoff.  Bacon. 
[02:00:30]  Bacon.  Where's the bacon?  I smell bacon, bacon, bacon.  Gotta be bacon.  Only one thing smells like bacon, and that's bacon!  Bacon, bacon, bacon there!  Please, please, give me what's in the bag!  Chewy, yummy, smoky, bacon!  There you go.  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!  It's bacon!  What was that?  You were saying?  Sex bagels?  Yeah, what...  What happened then?  I want to know.  Yeah, so...  So it was a Love Lines show, and you were what, and then how that...  I was running the board. 
[02:01:00]  I wasn't answering any of their love advice questions.  Two facts!  All right, getting better.  So finally, I answered one, and because my last name rhymes with bagel, the guy meant  to say, all right, sex advice from the bagel, but he said, all right, advice from the sex  bagel, and people at that station thought it was really funny.  One fact!  One fact!  One fact!  One fact!  And you decided to go with it.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:01:30]  Because it rhymes with bagel?  Look, you know, my name stinks on ice, but I was like 12 when I got the name.  I didn't have a choice.  I think when you're like...  18.  18, you have a choice to say, look, I'm not going to acknowledge that you're calling  me sex bagel.  But somewhere in there, you decided, hey, this could be good for me.  Interesting story, though.  Why would they call you the bagel?  Because it rhymes with Nagel, or because you're Dully?  Hit that button, stupid. 
[02:02:00]  Heading toward the finish line.  The Opie and Anthony show.  So that country singer admitted that she had that affair with Roger Clemens.  Roger Clemens, yep.  She's not denying it.  I wonder how old she was when they banged her for the first time.  Well, that's the issue, because they met when she was 15.  When's the statute over?  And supposedly he went back to, or she went back to his hotel room the night they met, 
[02:02:30]  but Roger swears, well, I don't know who's swearing, actually.  I don't know who said what, but basically they're saying they did not have sex that night,  and that it was a bit later when she became a huge star down there in Nashville.  Why is she talking about it now, though?  What is the purpose of bringing it up now?  I think because the newspaper brought it up.  How'd they get it?  So she's, I don't know.  Well, I don't know.  I think Brian McNamee has something to do with it.  And then she's trying to get her career back going, so this doesn't hurt her in the least. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, I guess so.  There is a statute of limitations on that, right?  Yeah, he can't get...  Hopefully.  He can't get to...  He can't get in trouble for that, can he?  Well, he's more worried about his image.  I mean, I don't think he's worried about...  Steroids.  Huh?  He's got the steroids thing, and another underage girl.  Right.  Whenever a guy knows too much about underage statutes, he's a pervert.  Like, yeah, dude, they slept together.  Dude, that only counts if she's 14 in Minnesota.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  How did you know that?  I know. 
[02:03:30]  I looked it up.  Yeah, I'm telling you, dude.  If it's within six months, and she's...  Give me a state.  I'll give you the law.  Come on.  Yeah, these guys have way too much knowledge.  Same joke twice.  Yeah.  Roger Clemens also may have had a relationship with a former bartender named Angela Moyers.  The paper's reporting today as well.  Oh.  They're coming out with their Roger Clemens stories.  I don't know.  I guess...  I mean, I wonder if people feel like he lied about certain things.  They're going to kill his credibility? 
[02:04:00]  I mean...  Yeah.  That's what...  That's what people do now.  It could affect his steroid thing, because now they're looking at his credibility.  Absolutely, Jimmy.  Man who took lampshade lie detector seeks settlement.  This dummy.  This is an amazing story.  The funniest story of the day.  Of the month.  A mentally disabled man who was given a fake lie detector test is still waiting for a settlement  after six years.  Pearl Police admitted that officers... 
[02:04:30]  Check this out.  Yeah.  ...put a lampshade on Huey Granger's head in June 2002.  Yeah.  Granger had filed a police report claiming that his daughter was attacked by her boyfriend  in their Pearl home.  While at the police station, officers Keith Peterson and Jeff Tames gave him a fake lie detector test.  Granger is adamant that two former Pearl police officers should pay for his pain and humiliation.  He is asking for $2 million in a civil lawsuit against the two men.  He's a retard.  Six flags!  He's a retard and they put a lampshade over his head. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, and told him it was a lie detector.  He's got a daughter?  Yeah.  That's frightening.  It really is.  I'm asking for $2 million tax-free in my pocket and my insurance paid for the rest of my life,  Granger said Friday.  He hit me in the back of my head and messed my neck up pretty bad and put a lampshade on my head with electric wires hooked to it.  Looked better than his hairdo.  Yeah, and you know it didn't light anything up.  That dull bulb.  I couldn't even read by it. 
[02:05:30]  Actually, his lawyer stepped in because he originally sued for eight lollipops.  You dumbbell.  Hey, what a dope.  And we've had an ongoing theme on the show this morning talking about the morning zoos out there and the Elvis Duran guy is number one in New York.  And the reason he's number one in New York, he's not taking this angle on the story.  Oh, I don't think so.  If they're even reporting on this story, they're like, oh, you've got to hear what happened to this man. 
[02:06:00]  It was terrible.  We find it hilarious.  He knew it wasn't a lie detector.  He knew it was a life of the party detector.  Oh, that lampshade on the head.  Oh, what a fool.  What a fool.  Let me back up again.  He hit me in the back of my head and messed my neck up pretty bad.  Then put a lampshade on my head with electric wires hooked to it and was trying to shoot electricity to me and get me to change my story to what happened to my daughter. 
[02:06:30]  The incident was videotaped.  Oh, my God.  YouTube.  Is that anywhere?  YouTube.  What could be funnier than just seeing this lummox sit there?  The funniest part would be to look in the corner and see the shadeless lamp with the bulb. 
[02:07:00]  Just the bare bulbs knowing the shade is being used for something hilarious.  It's in the corner and then you pan to the left and Dumb Bellow is just sitting there with his stupid Siemens furniture hat.  The incident was videotaped and the city admitted the officers were wrong.  Peterson and Thames were suspended and both eventually left the department.  Granger, who is mentally disabled, filed a lawsuit for civil rights violations. 
[02:07:30]  A federal judge ruled a few years ago that the city could not be held accountable for the officers' actions because there was not a documented pattern or history of abuse.  They just figured they could get away with it.  Yeah, one-time deal.  How many retards you get in there, you can put a lampshade on.  You can't do this every other day.  It's hysterical.  You know, you save this to do it one time, one time only.  Oh.  I don't have nothing against them either, Granger said.  I just hope they'll make up their minds and get this case settled because it's been going on too long. 
[02:08:00]  Two million dollars.  They should just give them a bag of marbles and say, here's your two million.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  They go try to buy a house with it.  Waving a plastic bag of marbles at a real estate agent.  Here you go, two million dollars.  No, these are marbles, dummy.  They walk into Levitt's and he asks for the hat section.  I need earmuffs.  He's got two doilies on the side of his head.  This guy's a boob.  What kind of an idiot. 
[02:08:30]  He's awful.  His hands are chilly, so he puts slipcovers over them.  A horse's ass.  Let's be able to put a lampshade on his head and call it a lie detector.  How did you not your whole, what did you think you just had, did you, like when they did that,  did you think, oh my God, I've had lie detector tests around my house my entire life?  Everywhere.  Everywhere I go, there's lie detectors.  I've been lying my entire life.  Oh, no.  Hey, can we get a lampshade for E-Rock?  Oh. 
[02:09:00]  E-Rock, would you try it out as our stunt boy today?  What?  Why?  Why?  That's the first reasonable thing I've heard him say.  He's had enough.  Retard sex from Boston, listening on BCN.  He writes, Opie, this happened on The Wire.  Yes, I remember this episode.  The cops, Anthony, they did something similar on The Wire.  The cops put a corner boy's hands on the Xerox machine and printed out pieces of paper with true and false on them.  So they'd ask him a question, put his hands on the Xerox machine, and then true would pop out and they'd show it to the corner boy. 
[02:09:30]  And they believed it as far as the show goes.  A mentally disabled man.  Yeah.  Oh.  Adult.  A adult.  A blithering idiot.  What a fool.  Oh.  Covering up that Moe haircut.  Moe Howard haircut.  Oh.  Super lampshade.  Put the lampshade on there and just trim around the lampshade.  Instant retard haircut.  He dozes off and he's chilly laying on the floor. 
[02:10:00]  So he has to pull the sofa on top of him to keep warm.  That guy's a clod.  Oh, God.  Very nice.  They should have fingerprinted him with a toaster.  Here, put your hands in here, dummy.  We have to take a tongue print.  See that little socket over there?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Can we talk to this guy on the phone?  Oh, what guy? 
[02:10:30]  The retard?  Yeah, I would like to.  Why not?  Yeah, I'd love to.  Instead of I, a robot, he's doing a movie called I, Diet.  D-I-O-T.  No.  Wordplay.  Oh.  I don't know.  Let's go to the fun-o-meter, Jimmy.  I might be wrong here.  One sec.  Oh, damn.  That hurt.  That's not a good radio show.  Yikes.  And a radio show.  We don't have time for the seven-year-old stealing grandma's SUV. 
[02:11:00]  Another hilarious story.  Maybe we could sneak it in really fast.  What do you say?  Okay.  What do you say?  Let's go over there.  Give it a try.  Let's give it a try here.  A seven-year-old steals grandma's SUV and wrecks it.  Here's the story.  Letarian Milton is not your typical seven-year-old.  Few his age have ever driven an SUV up and down several busy streets.  It all started at his mother's townhouse.  Letarian says he took the car keys and hopped into his grandmother's Dodge Durango.  When I came through the back door, I looked on the counter. 
[02:11:30]  I took my grandma's car because I got mad at my mom, and then I suddenly had my friend  come in, and he smoked with cigarettes.  He started the vehicle, then put it into gear.  His friend smoking cigarettes.  Smoked cigarettes.  What the hell?  Well, what the hell?  Come on.  Let's be real here.  What video game did this kid?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Stealing.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  One for the good guys.  He's seven years old.  He's rocking the SUV.  His friend smoking cigarettes. 
[02:12:00]  Smoking cigarettes.  They're cruising.  These stories are always so cute.  The anchors, I was like, and he never drove one before, unless they run people over or end  up dead.  Yeah.  If they kind of just wreck a little and everyone's okay, it's a cute little story.  I wish I'd do this when I was a kid.  I didn't have the balls to do this.  I put my mom's car in reverse once in my grandmother's parking lot.  And it was a big deal, right?  And it slowly rolled down, and there was a big cement truck coming down the road. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  And my mother was like, what?  Coming to running out.  I didn't know what to do after I put it in reverse either.  I'm like, I don't know what the foot pedals do.  Didn't you feel like a NASCAR driver, though?  No, I was very scared.  I started crying, of course, because that's all I ever did as a kid.  Was just crying.  I'm rolling backwards.  Put a lampshade on my head.  Well, they say that this kid driving the SUV actually did run into a man who was standing  in the middle of the street with a red pom-pom hat claiming to be a traffic light. 
[02:13:00]  Let's learn more about Letarian Milton.  A friend come in, and he smokes with cigarettes.  He started the vehicle and put it into gear.  I yanked the thing.  And off they went, two seven-year-olds alone on the road.  Letarian drove several miles through Lake Park and Palm Beach Gardens.  We got the one call that I told you about of a driver in the vehicle who looked too short  to be able to see over the steering wheel.  Along the way, he ran over two mailboxes, hit two parked cars in a Costco parking lot, and  struck two moving cars near Walmart. 
[02:13:30]  What video game did he learn this from?  Knocking on the mailbox?  Right.  These kids were rocking.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  This rules.  A little more to the story.  I want to do it because it's fun. 
[02:14:00]  It's fun to do bad things and drive into a car.  Did you know that you could perhaps kill somebody?  Yes, but I wanted to do hoorah stuff for my friend.  I want to do what?  Hoorah stuff.  Hoorah?  I don't know, but this kid should be incarcerated immediately.  He's a lost cause.  He's just a kid.  A lost cause.  He's just a kid.  He's not being...  First of all, is it his grandmother's SUV?  He's cute.  He's a cute little kid.  He lives with his grandmother?  Is that what I'm led to believe?  But he was mad at his mom.  Of course he does.  Where's his mom?  What prison is she in? 
[02:14:30]  Or what friggin...  I think that was hood rat stuff.  Is it?  Thanks, Nick Carter.  Hood rat stuff?  Oh, okay.  Danny, are you mad that he blew up your spot?  No, that's all right.  Yeah, but...  Wait, no, hold on.  What happened?  Wait, what happened?  Nick Carr is black, so, you know, he's giving us a little knowledge from the black community.  What does hood rat mean?  Just a hood rat.  Kid in the hood.  No, he said, I want to do hood rat stuff.  I play Led Zeppelin for a living.  I don't know.  Danny.  Danny. 
[02:15:00]  Danny, come in here because we're almost done.  Did I piss him off?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I think he did.  No, I don't think so.  Are you mad, Danny?  Well, no.  I just ran in here with some info.  I didn't know Nick Carter was working for the show now.  That's all.  Oh!  Oh!  I mean, considering that, you know, I found the...  I was pushing that story for the last three days.  I'm so glad that Nick provided all that helpful information for our show today.  Oh, dang.  Nick just likes coming on to...  Nick Carter, what?  To let Boston know he's still alive.  That's all.  Whatever the hell he's on.  Yeah.  You're mad, Danny?  Wow. 
[02:15:30]  What does hood rat mean?  It just annoyed me a little bit.  It's just a...  Yeah, ghetto, like ghetto stuff.  We know.  Nick told us.  Oh.  I told that.  Come on.  What are you talking about, Danny?  Why does he know anything about it?  We got to get to the other stories so the affiliates go back to music.  Did you know that you could perhaps kill somebody?  Yes, but I wanted to do hood rat stuff for my friend.  Hooded all ended on Investment Lane and Consumer Drive.  That's where Letarian hit the curb and sideswiped the sign.  The SUV took most of the beating, snapping off one of his axles and wheels.  A grandmother's rage.  I want to whip his behind. 
[02:16:00]  That's what I want to do right now.  If I thought they wouldn't take me to jail, I'd whip his behind right now.  Don't do it.  Then don't do it.  Let him just keep doing it.  This is a criminal in the making.  He's just an adorable little boy.  Stop it.  He is not.  He's just acting out a little bit.  Acting out.  He wants to do it because it's fun.  Oh, you could have killed someone.  I don't care.  I'm doing hood rat stuff with my friend.  We all did stuff like this at seven.  No, we didn't.  Jimmy's cute.  He's just being a shit lad.  He's not as cute as a little button. 
[02:16:30]  Where's his mother?  Where's his father?  I don't know.  Where are they?  Maybe they're working hard.  Where are they?  Kids do this stuff.  Kids do the craziest things.  These are the problems that should be addressed and dealt with in this country because this is one  of the major issues that are destroying this country.  He's just a little boy.  Little boys taking little boy things?  Yeah.  No.  No.  Fast forward a few years.  Yeah.  I want to do hood rat stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's being a little boy.  Yeah, you grow out of it.  Slinging rock.  You grow out of it after a while.  No, you don't.  Yes, you do. 
[02:17:00]  That kid needs some severe discipline right now.  He's just a little boy.  That stupid grandma ain't going to frigging do.  How come when they put these kids with grandma, they grow up horribly?  No one.  Grandma can't dish out the discipline.  Just being a boy.  Even to a kid.  Just a cute little boy.  He's like smoking cigarettes.  Just being a kid.  You know.  Yeah.  Who didn't do stuff?  I mean, I didn't steal a car that anybody didn't have access to.  I probably would have.  It's just innocent stuff to get mommy's attention. 
[02:17:30]  At seven, you just stole a car.  You don't realize consequences.  You just know you're going for a ride with your friend being big boys.  Oh, Jesus.  You don't realize.  It's like he was 12 trying to run people over.  He hit a couple of mail ones.  He will be.  Let's get back to the story.  We got to get out of here.  We're kidding.  Whip is behind right now.  You don't think you should be punished for all of this?  Just a little bit no video games for the whole weekend.  And one unusual story for police.  Are you sorry?  You understand that now your grandma's going to have to pay to have those cars fixed.  Because you hit those cars.  Can my mom help her? 
[02:18:00]  The grandmother has custody of the boy.  Palm Beach Gardens police say they do plan to move forward with charges of grand theft against  the seven-year-old.  He's obviously too young to go into any type of juvenile facility.  But police say they do want to get him into the system so they can get him some type of help.  He's seven.  There you go.  Run him through.  Run him through the system.  He's just a little kid.  Run him through the system.  That's adorable.  Grandma's raising him, right?  She's doing it best she can.  How cute is that?  Can my mom help?  I'm sure mom would raise him, but she's too busy working hard. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Where's mom?  Yeah.  He's just a little boy.  Can mom help?  No, she can't.  That was a cute question.  I don't know.  That's a cute little story.  How much money can she pull in on her back?  Just a cute little story.  Real cute.  Just seven.  We're doomed as a nation.  He'll grow out of it.  Doomed as a nation, people.  Doomed.  He wasn't mean.  He was just being a little kid.  It wasn't like he did it to be malicious.  He's just.  Yes, he did.  He did it to be a hood rat.  He said, can my mom help?  How cute is that? 
[02:19:00]  It's a cute question.  All right.  That part was kind of cute.  That was very cute.  That shows you right there.  What should your punishment be?  No video games for a weekend?  Yeah.  That's a big punishment to him.  You do that for spilling something in your house.  Spilling it.  No video games.  Get in your room.  Not for stealing a car and sideswiping other cars.  That should show you that he's seven.  He doesn't.  Yeah, he's too young to know, Ant.  All right.  Okay.  Come on.  You got to give him a seven-year-old.  Can't wait until he's got a gun up your nose as you're trying to get to your car.  Well, he's nine. 
[02:19:30]  Nick Carter is next here in New York City.  Yes.  Maybe Danny can come in and do some breaks for him.  Adam 12 in Boston, right?  Who's on next in Buffalo?  I don't know.  Or Syracuse.  I don't know.  Very talented people.  Who's up next in Cleveland?  I don't know.  Very talented person.  Maybe we need some of that info.  We're off to XM.  Have a good day.  Later.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:00]  XM 202.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[02:20:30]  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Soft Show Radio Hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it ****, feel free.  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from **** to my ****.  That's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio V-Rock in the bathroom. 
[02:21:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You're a sick freak!  Can you pop this there?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst.  The worst show I've.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  So what happened on the walkover today? 
[02:21:30]  I heard that there's a slight situation with Danny.  Well, Razzle Rizzo was crossing the street.  Razzle Rizzo.  I'm walking here.  Fucking cabbie beat that.  Wow.  What?  A cabbie beat that Danny and then what happened?  Danny was on a tear.  First of all, as you recall, a few moments ago, he got a little upset at Nick Carter over  there at 92.3 K-Rock.  But I think something else is going on because I don't think Nick knew that you were running  in to give us the info. 
[02:22:00]  I don't know.  Like, how did that, how'd that develop there, Danny?  Well, I don't know.  I guess.  Only Travis is coming in with the info.  I just want to see Danny turn around mad.  I don't know.  I guess when someone's sitting in front of a live microphone, they obviously have nothing  to say.  Oh!  So, it wasn't so much that he came in.  Like, it kind of annoys me that he runs in there like, he never kind of has anything  in the first place, but whatever.  I mean, so come on.  What does he do?  He doesn't fucking have anything. 
[02:22:30]  He's a shitty music jock on a shitty radio station.  So, anyway.  And then he fucking, you know, I obviously know what's going on with the story because  I fucking, I run in there, you know, when you guys didn't know what the kid said in  the clip.  Well, to back up even further, like, Danny, during one of the breaks, we love taking you  inside this crap.  Danny, in between breaks, we check in on everybody, and Danny reminds me, hey, this is a really  good story.  You really should try to get to this.  Yeah, I've been pushing it because, you know, I thought it was good.  You know it's going to be good, and you know we're going to make something out of it.  But, anyway, okay. 
[02:23:00]  So, you were all over this.  This was your little baby.  Yeah, and that wasn't even the half of it.  What really just annoyed me was how stupid Nick Carter had to come in and then rip the microphone  out of my face.  Like, there's at least three other microphones he probably could have used to say whatever  he needed to say.  And if he got the information out before me, oh, well, you know, big deal.  But he physically ripped the microphone out from my mouth.  Disregarding you, basically, that you were sitting there.  To chime in.  And what did he add?  He was just explaining what hood rat means. 
[02:23:30]  But he didn't even say that.  No, he just said, he said, it's like, what did they say?  They said hood rat.  Oh, yeah, because we didn't even understand what the kid said at first.  Right, all right, so why would he say hood rat and then we needed the definition of hood  rat and Nick didn't have anything?  Right.  He's like an eighth Cherokee, isn't he?  He said he didn't know.  He just plays Led Zeppelin.  Right.  Which was kind of funny.  I think there's something else going on.  Why are you agitated?  Because then I heard you had an incident with the kid.  Well, then, what's going on? 
[02:24:00]  Me and Jimmy were already laughing at how angry Danny had gotten at Nick as we were doing  the walkover.  We were physically laughing.  And let it be known, Nick pulls me aside and goes, your boy's really mad at me.  It was just an annoying thing for him to do, I thought.  It was just very obnoxious on his end.  So, in the middle of us kind of laughing at Danny getting mad at Nick, I hear, hey!  And I recognize it's Danny's voice.  And I look in the middle of the block. 
[02:24:30]  Danny's in the middle of probably the main thoroughfare, aside from Broadway in Manhattan.  Middle of 57th Street.  57th Street.  Just yelling at a cab in the crosswalk.  It was a little more than hey.  Yeah.  It was more like, what, motherfucker?  What?  That was it.  What?  Because these fucking cab drivers.  It's not just the cabs either.  It's even...  The buses are way worse.  Yeah.  Way worse.  They cut right in front of you.  It works.  And make people jump back onto the curb.  It does work both ways.  And it works.  It works just like any other city in America. 
[02:25:00]  If I have the light, I could walk across the street.  You have to sit there and wait for me to cross before you could find your inn.  And I'm in the middle of the crosswalk.  And I think this taxi guy expected me to start speeding up or jog across so that he could  get to his next red light faster.  And I just wasn't fucking having it.  And he honked at me.  And it just could...  Like, it set me off to the point where I couldn't just walk and curse him out.  I had to, like...  I had to stop.  You stopped.  You went up to his window.  Made sure his window was rolled down so I could point my finger and scream in his face, 
[02:25:30]  what the fuck is your problem?  And then the argument continued down the block a little ways.  Yeah, because he wanted to try and be, like, a little bit of a wise-ass himself.  So he's kind of...  He got his passenger window rolled down.  And he's just kind of coming up on my side trying to, you know, trying to, like, give  me the come-here fingers.  And I'm like, fuck you.  I ain't getting fucking close to you.  You should have fought him, man.  Fighting cabbies is fun, actually.  And then that just got me and Jimmy, like, we're just pointing, going, look at Danny.  Look at him.  And Anthony had the perfect word.  He goes, what a grouch. 
[02:26:00]  I go, Danny's a little grouch today.  I was a grouch.  That's exactly the word.  I was giggling at that all the way up.  Grouch.  Grouch.  Grouch.  That's a funny word.  It just annoys me.  Like, what makes...  Yeah.  Like, what makes Nick Carter think he could just run in and grab the microphone out of my  face?  What makes this fucking cab driver think that he could just honk at me when I'm just civilly  trying to crawl on it?  You know something?  You don't want to be treated like a piece of nagel.  You know, you're absolutely right.  You're a person.  I felt like I was nagled upon. 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  Don't read instant feedback if you're in a bad mood today.  Why?  You just don't want to do it.  What are they saying?  Oh, nothing, really.  What?  Danny's a bitch.  Yeah, I'm used to it.  Danny's a bitch.  Do you think he's being a grouch?  I think he's being a grouch.  I think so.  Oh, you think he's going to be a grouch?  Oh, he's going to yell at him.  Oh, he's going to yell at him.  Uh, well, punch rock groin from a funny website. 
[02:27:00]  Punch rock groin?  He writes, when Danny said Nick didn't have anything, was he referring to alcohol poisoning?  And then he got a Danny role, so, so far, so good.  Yeah.  Uh, Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Who the fuck is Danny going to be talking shit about?  Nick Carter, Danny's a fucking nobody.  Yeah, you don't like me.  Yeah, I only work for one of the biggest radio shows in the country.  Thank you, sir.  I'm a nobody.  Who doesn't like Danny?  Fast Freddy doesn't like you?  I guess.  I don't know.  I think I recall seeing some negative.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's cool. 
[02:27:30]  Really?  Uh, and, well, and Fast Freddy's obsessed with you at this point.  He's like a, like a stalker, like Uma's got going on these days.  As a listener, I'd much rather hear Nick than that white douche Danny.  Well, you know what, Fast Freddy?  By all means, you could turn off XM, and you're from Jamaica Station, so you could gladly  put on K-Rock and listen to all the fucking horse shit that Nick Carter has to tell you  today.  Ooh.  Wow.  He told Fast Freddy.  There you go.  Steven S. from Bayshore, uh, I think he, he's kidding here, but he does say Danny is  the angriest of the Keebler elves. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, they like that one out there.  Thank you.  Congratulations to Nick Carter for being relevant where Danny couldn't be.  Scott Martin from Japan.  Yeah, well, Scott Martin wasn't in the fucking room.  He didn't see me standing in front of a fucking, a microphone with the pot on, and then Nick  Carter just rudely grabbing it out from my mouth.  Do we have that audio?  Because it might, it did seem kind of, I was surprised Danny got mad, but I wasn't paying  attention.  I don't think we need to read anymore.  Oh, that's great.  You've heard enough, right? 
[02:28:30]  Or, no, I like it.  All right.  Ricky M. from Massachusetts.  I think Danny has a crush on Nick.  That's why he got really upset.  Maybe we should kiss on Ron and Fez and make everything better.  Oh, that would be nice.  I think a kid writes, what does Danny do besides complain and act like he is some kind of radio  god?  Danny's an overgrown intern.  Yeah.  Oh.  Overgrown?  I'm 5'7".  Nothing overgrown about me.  All right, why don't we turn off the feedback, because now they're really just getting ugly.  Well, you know what it is, I don't get very vocal, I guess, on the air until something  really fucking pisses me off. 
[02:29:00]  No, you're just, you're a little uptight today.  Uptight?  I think so.  Really?  You're a little on edge, yeah.  Well.  A little bit, a little bit.  It's okay.  People get frustrated.  Are you upset today?  Nah, it's just, you know, the rain makes me mad.  Rain is nasty.  It's been nasty for like two days straight now.  It gets me grouchy.  It's just cold, nasty, gray, rainy fucking shit.  We have that clip, by the way, if you want to.  Oh.  Yeah.  Any clips?  Let's hear it again.  I think that was hood rat stuff. 
[02:29:30]  Is it?  Thanks, Nick Carter.  Hood rat stuff?  Oh, okay.  Danny, are you mad that he blew up your spot?  All right.  Yeah, but...  Wait, wait, no, hold on.  What happened?  Wait, what happened?  Nick Carter is black, so, you know, he's giving us a little knowledge from the black community.  What does hood rat mean?  Just a hood rat.  Kid in the hood.  No, he said, I want to do hood rat stuff.  I play Led Zeppelin for a living.  I don't know.  Danny.  Danny.  Danny, come in here, because we're almost done.  Did I piss him off?  I don't know.  I don't think so. 
[02:30:00]  I knew he did.  I don't think so.  Are you mad, Danny?  Well, no.  I just ran in here with some info.  I didn't know Nick Carter was working for the show now.  That's all.  Oh.  Oh.  Considering that, you know, I found the...  I was pushing that story for the last three days.  I'm so glad that Nick provided all that helpful information for our show today.  Oh, dang.  Nick just likes coming on to...  Nick Carter, what?  To let Boston know he's still alive.  That's all.  There you go.  Wow.  Yeah.  I love Jimmy the fucking instigator. 
[02:30:30]  That's crazy.  He knows he's mad.  He's like, no, no, what?  What?  Danny, come here.  What?  What?  I did want to hear his response to it, because I knew Danny was his job.  But you're such an instigator.  Why is Sam coming in?  Oh, I thought he had something on Danny's situation.  No?  No.  No.  Well, but the second Nick, well, he walks by the office to get to the studio, and Sam,  of course, says, so, you know, Danny's really mad at you.  No, that's not even... 
[02:31:00]  No, no.  Sam goes, Sam goes, as Nick Carter is walking by, Sam goes, hey, Nick Carter, Danny's mad  at you.  And what's this that you just gave me?  The same thing we just played?  No, no, no.  It was just an idea that we had on the...  They are just...  There's an idea?  ...biggest instigators.  What is this?  No, like, just play it.  Danny, you start talking, and then when Danny starts talking, you play that.  All right, start talking.  Okay, hi.  92.3 K-Rack, I reverse my own policy of a long-standing policy.  Once I put on shorts for the first time for the spring or the summer, that's it. 
[02:31:30]  No matter what the weather is, I wear shorts.  It was like 80 degrees the other day, and today it's this.  Man, 92.3 K-Rack.  Was that a Nick Carter break from this morning?  Oh, that's fantastic.  Just now.  Just now.  He's getting ready for summertime.  It's a perfect little talk-up to summertime.  He should be running into Elvis Duran's studio with that material.  Oh, shit.  We got to fight a-brewin'.  Who knew? 
[02:32:00]  That's good stuff.  Oh, we got to fight a-brewin'.  You know, I was going to wear my boots today, fellas, but I was like, you know what?  I didn't waterproof him yet, so I put my Adidas' on instead.  What's wrong with you?  Danny doesn't play.  He's had it.  Danny's turning into a biker is what it is.  Yeah?  No, he's got to have a bad attitude so he can bash people.  He's got people's heads in with pool cues.  I don't know.  I used to...  My skin used to be so thick and just all the layers got peeled off and now, like, the  little thing just sets me off.  Just fucking beating down. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  I can't even tell you, like, how many times I've almost taken my Xbox controller through  my television.  And over nothing.  Over a fucking game.  Over getting dealt a terrible Texas Hold'em hand.  Like,  Jack 5 again?  Fuck!  Same fucking hand!  Yeah, how many times have you yelled that at the fucking computer?  How about you shuffle this, Mr. Computer?  You can play Hold'em on those games, too?  I actually might get that for the fucking PlayStation.  Yeah, you can get all these cool, you know, downloadable arcade games. 
[02:33:00]  You can go online and play with people.  On PlayStation, too?  Yeah, PlayStation has their own kind of version of...  On Xbox, it's Xbox Live.  It's, like, subscription-based.  I think it might be free, actually, on PlayStation Network.  I wish I had a Wii.  I wish I had a Wii, but I have to cut off my dick and turn it into a vagina.  I was with you, but I ended up playing the Wii and it was kind of fun.  Oh, the Wii.  You know, you're not really doing a lot of thinking, but it's a good party game when  you're just hanging around with some people drinking some beers. 
[02:33:30]  I wouldn't be playing it every night, but as a goof every once in a while, it wasn't  bad.  It wasn't bad.  I've got to be honest.  What?  The Wii.  The bowling, the Tiger Woods, the tennis with the big-headed people is pretty fun.  The Wii's not only fun, it's fun for everybody.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  Kids and the elderly.  It's a good game to socialize with.  I heard on the fan.  Top-selling console because only the kids and the elderly are picking it up.  Wii means family, doesn't it, fam?  It sure does.  That's in the let's somewhere.  It should be O-U-I, as in Wii.  Like, are you a faggot?  Wii.  Wii.  Thank you. 
[02:34:00]  A little French joke.  Thank you very much.  Got a few people that came to check out the show, even though it's raining here in New  York.  I appreciate that.  He's dressed like the fucking jock in every 80s movie.  There's another fight of Bruin, but Pat Duffy's not here, so do we save this audio?  Do we play it?  What do we do?  That's all right, I got the info on this one.  Yeah, all right.  He's doing that bit.  Should we play the audio and then we set it up for when Pat and Tony will be here at  the same time? 
[02:34:30]  Sure.  I guess.  Yeah, Tony is out.  If the audio is...  I'd be interested to hear a little bit of that.  We got some trouble Bruin, as we like to say here.  Sam and Than...  Than and Sam.  Than and Sam.  Oh.  We're doing their radio show this past Saturday night, and there's been a fight of Bruin  between Pat Duffy and Tony.  They're two guys that have worked for free way past their internships.  Both valuable.  How long have these guys been working?  Who knows?  They get into it, I think. 
[02:35:00]  I think Tony's been here for about two years, and Pat Duffy's a year and a half.  And Pat Duffy, not one pay...  Oh, yeah.  Pat Duffy, it's easy.  The eggnog thing.  Yeah, about a year and a half ago.  Yep.  All right, and it all came to a head on the Than and Sam show this past Saturday night.  So you got Tony, says Pat Duffy's a super fan.  Pat tries to defend himself.  Here we go.  I'm not sure you...  I don't have a typed out track list like that.  I just have numbers.  I bet Nick Carter would have it.  He sure would. 
[02:35:30]  After his shorts break.  That cabbie would have it.  That cabbie.  Track one.  Here we go.  That's not one.  This is all fucked up.  Oh, my God.  Sam, is it fucking...  One is three.  One is three.  Thank you.  You just defended yourself, though.  Pat Duffy's a little bit of an attention horse.  Hold on.  Wait.  No, Pat Duffy's not attention horse.  He's just a super fan, and he loves ONA, and I don't blame him.  We all love ONA.  It's why we work on the show.  And, you know, he wants to impress him.  That's fine, you know.  But, I mean, there is a difference between a producer, somebody who can produce content and 
[02:36:00]  make the show work, and a super fan.  There is a difference.  Absolutely.  Pat.  I think that that's totally unfounded, what he just said.  I don't do...  Unfounded?  I don't...  First of all, shut up.  Let him...  You gotta let him root.  That's not an argument, Tony.  You're just telling him to shut up.  It's true.  So that was the beginning.  It gets way worse.  In this next track, you're with me, Danny.  Yes.  All right.  Tony explains why you should be hired over Duffy. 
[02:36:30]  Who do you think would be the better hire?  You or Duffy?  Bottom line.  Why would you even ask that?  I'm just...  I gotta know, because there's a lot of friendliness going on, but we have to...  Because it's been a while since somebody got hired.  It's...  Odds are, with the wait, with the merger...  Sam, I've been here since you've been a fucking intern.  Yeah.  I know.  Since you've been an intern, I've been working here.  Right.  And working side-by-side by you guys and Travis and everybody else.  Yeah.  And fucking...  I haven't heard one bad thing said about me, and I've been fucking...  That's why there's a website, Tony for Miss Congeniality. 
[02:37:00]  Because everybody loves you.  Well, whatever.  If...  I love Pat.  If Pat gets hired, it's the day I quit.  Ooh.  Put it that way.  Pat?  Okay.  What do you...  I mean, do you...  Would you quit if Tony got hired?  No.  That was the...  Wow.  They're getting into it.  Yeah, we can feel drawn.  So far, not really a fucking knockdown dragger.  Yeah, nah, nah.  But I'm sure...  The beauty is that we don't even have a job to offer either one of the guys. 
[02:37:30]  But they're already...  They're already positioning, just in case one of these guys drops off and moves on.  Right.  We already have way too many guys on staff.  Well.  Which is...  Well, not way.  Which has been acknowledged many times by Ron Bennington.  Pat explains why he would be better.  The two debate.  Here we go.  Yeah.  If I was hired, I would definitely be a lot more productive than Tony.  Because Tony keeps claiming that he's been here for two years.  I've been here for 15 months, and I feel like it's a case of quality over quantity. 
[02:38:00]  Because Tony might have been here longer, but I feel that the time I've put in here  has been much more dedicated.  You don't do shit.  You rub fucking feces all over yourself.  Bullshit, I don't do shit.  What do you mean?  You do nothing.  I do constant shit.  What else do you do?  What else have you provided besides feces rubbing on yourself?  What else have you provided?  Pat's got that great guess the sound bit.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, let's go on fucking YouTube.  Somebody get hit in the nuts, like America's Funniest Videos, and fucking play it, and it's  fantastic.  Pat effing Duffy.  Kind of like... 
[02:38:30]  Pat effing...  Wow.  Wow.  Tony is...  What's wrong with Tony?  Why is he so pissed?  I'm just kind of throwing Pat Duffy's bit to the side.  I mean, Pat Duffy's bits have gotten a lot of views on the internet.  Yeah, it's a good bit.  It continues.  Than doesn't appreciate Tony's lip.  Kind of like what you did with the taser thing, which was your big bit.  First of all, stop.  It wasn't my big bit.  I had it in my pocket.  Don't tell me to fucking stop.  I'll yell at you on this fucking show.  You don't tell me what to do.  It's fine.  Explain yourself, though.  You should align yourself with the right party. 
[02:39:00]  You're aligning yourself with the wrong party right now.  I'm aligning myself with the future.  Let's not confuse the issue.  Oh, is he the future to you?  He's got potential.  Is Pat Duffy your future?  Is that what you're saying?  No, I'm not going to ever work for Pat Duffy.  Let's not confuse the issue.  Pat Duffy just said...  I want to know if Dan thinks Pat Duffy is more important than I am to the Opie and Anthony  show.  I'm not going to answer that honestly, because then you'll leave.  Oh, wow.  Well, tell me...  So that means you think he's more...  Go ahead.  Tell me right now.  I'll fucking...  I want to know.  This is between you and Pat Duffy. 
[02:39:30]  Wait, he really thinks he's more important to the Opie and Anthony show than Pat Duffy?  Hmm.  Wow.  Hmm.  Wow.  Well, what now?  Here's...  I got to put Devils out here.  What kind of behind the scenes stuff?  Because a lot of stuff's done behind the scenes.  Like, you know, a lot of people don't see the audio being gathered, but we don't just  magically have it.  These guys get it.  So what does Tony do behind the scenes?  I thought it was magic.  I think...  No, Anthony, it's not.  You think a little fairy just points?  Well, sometimes.  Yes.  I have a hernia. 
[02:40:00]  I never will lift that many cocks in once again.  Predictable.  We haven't even talked about Steve yet.  He's got to say.  He's at a neurosurgeon.  He's at a neurosurgeon today.  He's gone until two seconds ago, and you said that.  He's at a neurosurgeon today.  He's got herniated discs all over the place.  And the doctors are very, very concerned.  Sure they are.  I'd like a little stick-to-it if mis-inplanted.  Maybe we could get Steve on the phone to talk about his herniated discs.  Yes.  No, it was a mistake.  It's herniated dicks.  I have a lot of herniated dicks. 
[02:40:30]  Sam, what's going on?  We got Sam in the studio.  Well, Tony thinks that he's done a lot of writing in the past for Steve in terms of production work.  And he started up with a couple bits.  Like, he did Deuce Joe Theater, and he did...  Which is good.  It has potential.  We've only had once.  One in two weeks.  One.  And he did a...  He says that he stays at XM while everybody else is at CBS and does work that nobody sees. 
[02:41:00]  Which, if it's true, he does a lot of work.  Well, one of these XM shows...  All right.  One of these XM shows, we'll have Tony and Duffy in at the same time.  We'll get into this.  Today, we only have Tony here.  And, you know, it should be said that both these guys worked their asses off.  But I...  And this is going to piss off Tony.  I think Pat Duffy's done way more for the Opie and Anthony show.  On-air stuff is fucking...  But I'll give Tony a chance to, you know, to debate that fact.  You know what, though?  Go to your job, whatever it may be, and tell your boss you want a paycheck for work that he won't see. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Eating puke and rubbing fucking homeless guy shit on you.  That's a tough one, man.  That's fucking on-air stuff.  That's valuable stuff.  That's valuable stuff.  On-air stuff is very hard to top.  Yep.  Absolutely.  But not to take away from Tony either, wishy-washy, Norton says.  Everyone loves me.  Because he's currently...  Getting something for me?  Yes, exactly.  What, is he getting food for yourself?  No, he's just getting that Beastie Boys video because we have Adam from the Beastie Boys.  Yeah, we got Adam coming in. 
[02:42:00]  I can never say his last name.  I can either.  Adam from the Beastie Boys in about 20 minutes.  Tony and Duffy start fighting over their hair.  Yeah.  Tony kind of just goes after people sometimes.  All right, let's listen to this.  On the Pat Duffy versus Tony issue.  Tony, I just changed the pad data.  Do you know how to do that?  Yeah, I do.  You hit fucking the thing twice, you fucking douchebag.  I learned that the first three months I was here.  Nice haircut.  Thanks.  At least mine grows.  Yeah, you get all the fucking...  Wow.  The fake faux hawk that you got. 
[02:42:30]  It's really impressive.  Looks good.  Thanks.  No, it's terrible.  Wow.  Tony's angry, man.  Just flailing.  Morale is low.  Yeah, we never guaranteed these guys jobs.  We have too many people we're paying already.  I think you have the right amount.  Technically, we probably should be firing a couple people.  Then thin it out a little bit.  Really?  Yeah, there's too much growth in here.  Who?  I don't know who.  I'm not...  Well, I do know, but...  Oh, geez.  Tony tells Pat Duffy that he gets breakfast. 
[02:43:00]  Here we go.  I'm not getting coffee for fucking anybody because I've been here that long.  You might have to come in two days a week to get coffee for people.  I've been there, done that.  It's not happening.  I'm not coming in to get coffee for anybody.  So you do less.  I don't get coffee.  You do get coffee.  You got me a fucking...  You got me like an egg sandwich two weeks ago, you fucking lying scum, man.  You're a liar.  You come in and ask me what I want for breakfast, motherfucker.  Because I'm an intern.  It's my job.  I'll ask anybody to do that.  Because I have fucking stay in this place. 
[02:43:30]  That's why.  Would you ask...  And by the way, Tuesday when I come in, I want a pork roll, egg and cheese, asshole.  I don't care if you have to go to Jersey for it because I don't make it in New York.  Go to Jersey and get me a pork roll, egg and cheese, asshole.  Speaking of Tuesday.  Oh, my God.  I like that.  You got me coffee today, you fucking scumbag.  That was so over the top and unnecessary.  He's talking about how he got him something, too.  Yeah, you did that nice thing for me, you fucking piece of shit.  You fucking scumbag.  That's great. 
[02:44:00]  Now we're rocking.  Tony threatens Pat Duffy and starts making dad jokes.  Speaking of Tuesday, Than last week told me, hey, we don't have any interns in on Tuesday.  Yeah, and I was in last Tuesday and I did shit.  Hey, shut the fuck up for a second.  Don't tell me to shut the fuck up.  I'll come in there and slap the shit out of your fucking mouth.  I dare you, guys.  I fucking dare you.  You guys, let's not get physical.  I fucking dare you.  I'll destroy you, you fucking asshole.  Who do you think you are talking to me like that?  We're not about who can beat up who.  Who do you fucking do?  Who do you think you are in there?  We're about whose dad can beat up who. 
[02:44:30]  No, we're about...  Tell your dad to keep calling the show up until you get hired.  All right, that's fucking great.  Okay, so Tony, eat my dad out of this.  All right, enough with the dad.  Hey, fuck you!  Wow, these guys.  Holy shit.  Just fighting dirty.  Neither guy has been paid ever, basically.  At this point, Tony was getting especially frustrated because I didn't put him on the  clips because we already had ten clips here, but Than started taking calls as to whether  the audience thought that Tony or Pat Dovey should be hired.  Tony doesn't come across too well. 
[02:45:00]  I mean, he's awesome, but he's really like...  At the close of the voting day, Tony unfortunately lost at ten to one.  Well, Tony's coming back in a few minutes.  Maybe we can get just a couple of calls.  Sure.  We don't want a trash package passed on here, but I would like to at least...  When are both going to be in-house again?  They should...  Well, Pat Dovey will be in on Wednesday through Friday, and so we'll get Tony to come in  one of those days.  Okay.  And Sam, why were you trying to break up a possible fight?  Yeah.  Saying there's no violence here.  Shame on you.  I think his arms were folded across his chest when he said that. 
[02:45:30]  He didn't stand up and put his arms out of being a responsible broadcaster.  You don't want the Fan and Sam franchise to be injured by such a fracas.  Yeah.  By a lot of media attention.  Of course not.  Tony says he shouldn't have been brought on earlier.  He should have been brought on earlier and says that he could have spent the time doing  his bit properly.  Yeah.  His bit was to find an online date and bring her in on the show because we established  on the previous show that he was going to start online dating, and since there's so  much time between the shows, we figured he could get a date and bring her in, but he 
[02:46:00]  didn't.  Okay.  And so he had failed his first bit, so that's when we started talking to him about the Tony  versus Pat Duffy situation.  All right.  And don't tell me to come in.  I came in and, like, fucking took the 7.30 train.  I'm here by fucking nine.  And this shit happened.  What else were you going to do from 7.30 to if you waited for a later train?  Probably get online dates.  Boom.  Right there.  For our show.  Right in your face, right?  He's blaming you.  Right in your face, Sam.  Could have brought an online date, bro. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  But you didn't.  You texted us today saying, sorry, I blew it.  Thanks for fucking texting me back, too.  Sam texted me back.  Thanks for texting me back.  What the fuck, Tony?  You were too busy to text me back, too, by the way?  Yeah, I don't know.  Believe it or not.  Yeah.  I texted you at, like, 5.  You couldn't text me back.  And say what?  You fucking suck?  Say, okay.  I gave you a heads up so you knew what to do.  Yeah.  We salvaged it.  No thanks to you.  That's what I'm supposed to say.  Thanks for making my job harder. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  He was pissing you off, too.  Yeah.  He kind of devolved into Dan versus Tony for a little while.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And then Tony asked to leave.  What's that about?  He was tired of being disrespected after the 10 phone calls.  And he thought me and Dan were throwing him under the bus.  So you beat him down pretty good.  And you get this, right?  I appreciate it.  I do appreciate you sending the text.  All right.  You know what?  Fine.  Fine.  I'm going to say fine.  Good.  That's all I'm going to say.  That's right.  Appreciate it.  Play my outro music. 
[02:47:30]  I had enough of this garbage.  Nope.  Play it.  Nope.  I don't want to ever come back.  Play it.  Tony, I don't want to see you go.  Play it.  Play me the outro.  Pat Tuffy, do not play that music.  Tuffy, you know you want to hear it.  Play it and I'll never come back.  Don't play it.  Nope.  Play it.  No.  Stop stroking your faux hawk and play it.  No.  Wait, the guy that doesn't get paid has outro music?  Well, we gave him a theme song, so he has intro and outro music.  It's an integral part of the Thin and Sam show.  Experience. 
[02:48:00]  This is it?  Yeah.  This is the outro music.  It's fantastic.  He just comes lumbering into the studio.  Too good.  And then finally, Tony says Thin and Sam should have Pat Tuffy start doing the show with them.  What's this about?  He basically said, stop having me and put Pat Tuffy in my chair.  He was very frustrated.  Okay.  Let me tell you something.  I appreciate what you've done, putting me on or whatever.  I think I'm an integral part of the show.  You're a part of the show. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Sam's integral.  I'm integral.  I think it ends there.  All right.  That's fine.  That's your opinion.  Pat, how do you think Tony's been doing on this show?  I think he fell apart in the last couple minutes.  Yeah, why don't you have Pat Tuffy on here for 15 shows, see how he does.  Have him on here.  He's the new guy.  Okay.  He's the new guy.  And then we kind of, and that was it.  Yeah.  And that's where we've left it.  Have they seen each other since? 
[02:49:00]  No.  Really?  And we had to talk down Tony for like, he made us talk to him for like an hour after  the show about being disrespected and this and that.  Oh my God.  What's wrong with him?  Where is he?  Is he here?  He'll be here.  And if he's getting to grab something from the store, he's on his way back.  What is he getting?  Something from the Beastie Boys.  Oh, that's right.  But he'll be back shortly.  Yeah.  Who knew he had such a fucking stable of kooks?  Yeah.  It's a little weird.  That's our fault.  We should have had these guys all in the air more.  They're all fucking psychos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Danny's having a meltdown. 
[02:49:30]  Fucking San and Famer just pricks.  Tony hates everything.  Who the fuck knew?  Who knew?  What a stable of fucking wackos.  The Wack Pack.  They are like everyone's got mental problems.  Oh, they're all fucking out of their minds.  Mm-hmm.  What's wrong with Tony?  I don't know.  Who knew Tony was so angry?  You get him rolling just a little bit because he's trying so hard to be friendly with everybody  and for everyone to like him.  And you can tell he's not a friendly, likable guy. 
[02:50:00]  No, he's a douchebag, which is great.  He's frustrated that he's not hired.  Yeah, in a big way.  But it's obvious that there's a log jam here.  So like when we were in his position, you got to like look around for other radio jobs.  I hate to see someone like him go, but he said he's tried.  He's most frustrated that there's a possibility that if an opening did appear, he wouldn't  get it and somebody else would because he thinks his tenure here, you know, he's been  here two and a half years, whatever.  Right.  Okay.  Well, it's an ongoing story. 
[02:50:30]  We'll get both those guys in studio in the very near future.  We got to take a quick break.  We got Adam from the Beastie Boys.  I just heard he arrived.  We'll get him on the show next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents sex advice with Jim North.  Build up that immunity.  Keep fucking them without bags.  You want to be a fucking man or you want to live in a dress the rest of your life?  How's your body ever supposed to learn what age looks like and reject it if it doesn't  see it?  Stick it in her ass without a condom and then laugh about it later.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:51:00]  We got Adam from the Beastie Boys making his way into the studio. 
[02:51:30]  Where's Adam?  What's up, Adam?  There he is.  Hey, Mip.  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  Can't complain.  Good.  What's going on?  I'm a huge Beastie Boys fan.  I just want to say right off the bat.  Huge.  And it's about time we get to talk to you, my friend.  Yeah.  You can pop your headphones on because I'm sure listeners are going to be calling and going,  you know, I'm a huge fan.  So what do you got going on these days? 
[02:52:00]  Well, I just finished this documentary on high school basketball players.  So that's why I'm up here.  I'm promoting that film.  What's that one about?  It's called Gunning For That Number One Spot.  And it follows eight of the top 24 high school basketball players in 2006 as they prepare  to step on to the Rucker Park courts for the top high school players game, right?  Yep.  Very, very personal interest.  Something you've been interested in? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  I mean, I actually didn't know too much about it going into it.  A friend of mine was organizing this All-Star game, this high school All-Star game, and he  was trying to get, he's asking me for advice on how to document it.  And I was just throwing out ideas about how to document it.  And like before, you know what?  I was doing it somehow.  All of a sudden, it's your project.  Well, you probably had the ability to bankroll it more than your friend, too.  Maybe so.  Yeah, that might be.  That might help.  You had a brilliant idea, though. 
[02:53:00]  I love this idea for the documentary where the fans sent in all the video that they took.  Yeah.  We gave out cameras at a concert.  Yeah, that was for the concert movie.  Awesome.  I fucking shot that, which I thought, yeah.  But brilliant.  That's right.  You guys can curse on the air.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Crazy.  Yeah.  All right.  Completely original idea for a documentary to have the fans do it.  And plus, it's going to get fan interest up.  And to buy it, it's just completely different than anything anybody ever has ever done. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  It's definitely an interesting process editing that thing.  I bet.  A lot of footage.  A lot of shit to sort through.  Yeah.  Did you get anybody doing the stuff we do with cameras?  There's like someone leaves a wedding camera and then you go and they take pictures of  like their balls and their asshole.  You ever do that at somebody's wedding when they leave the camera?  You run into the bathroom with your friends and take pictures of your bags?  I have not.  No, I haven't actually done that.  But a friend of mine did that.  And then you could see his, like, the bottom of his shirt and then you could...  Oh, tell who it was?  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  What a dummy.  When you guys first got together as the Beastie Boys, was that a goof?  Were you just like goofing around thinking, I'm sure you never thought it would end up the  monster it became?  Yeah.  I mean, early on, we were hanging out.  It was kind of like this small hardcore scene in Lower Manhattan and kind of like everybody  was in bands.  Everybody was probably in like five different bands and...  Mostly rock bands, though.  I mean, a bunch of white guys.  Yeah.  I'm just talking about like hardcore, like the early days of hardcore. 
[02:54:30]  And so we just, like Beastie Boys was one of those bands.  It was just kind of like formed on a whim, like, yo, we should make a band.  But it ended up lasting a long time.  Yeah.  And then kind of, you know, getting into the rap thing, though, like three white guys like  that, it wasn't really something you saw back then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't...  It was definitely a strange thing to have.  So I'm assuming it was probably kind of hard to get any kind of credibility back then 
[02:55:00]  in the rap community, especially.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  I mean, pretty early on, we started...  Russell Simmons started managing us and we started opening for like Run DMC and opening  for Curtis Blow and going on tour.  And so I think that kind of put it in a different light.  Were you well-received at the beginning?  Like when you would open for some of these name rap acts?  You know, they see...  Sometimes. 
[02:55:30]  I mean, sometimes...  ...three white guys come out and go, what the...  Like, yeah, I think when we opened for Curtis Blow in Queens at the Encore, and I think  people were definitely like, what the fuck is this?  Yeah.  It was crazy.  But I think we got a pretty good reception when we were like opening up for Run DMC and  LL and Houdini on some of the tours.  Wow.  When did you guys realize that this was going to be something that lasts?  Like, License to L was a massive, massive success.  I mean, was that when you realized, like, wow, this is going to stay around for a long 
[02:56:00]  time?  I don't know.  Not necessarily, because, I mean, that kind of had Flash in the Pan written all over it.  It was a great crossover, though, because, you know, a lot of people that were into rock  definitely into the Beastie Boys and rap, you know, so it crossed over very well.  And, you know, your videos helped, too, with MTV.  I mean, that was another thing.  They were always tongue-in-cheek and very clever and creative. 
[02:56:30]  You guys, of course, had a lot of input on those, huh?  Yeah.  And we were pretty involved in making the videos.  And that's how a lot of the way that I kind of got more into directing and got interested  in directing is from working on music videos.  Yeah, because, I mean, everyone remembers the Sabotage video is fucking hysterical.  Yeah.  Just really funny spoof on 70s action movies.  And did you direct that one? 
[02:57:00]  I did not direct that one.  Oh, you didn't direct that one.  Okay.  I was wondering.  You guys got pretty political as it went on, too.  Like, you guys, I guess, as you grew up, you started, like, looking at issues differently.  And it's like, all right, well, it's fun to kind of do this.  But, like, did you all of a sudden start saying, well, I want to address things in the world  more?  Like, what happened?  Because you guys all of a sudden started getting political.  And you were kind of tied with Mumia.  And you were tied with, like, the free Tibet movement.  And it became more than just, like, wow, these guys are kind of goofy and entertaining.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, I mean, I guess there was, I guess we started taking more of an interest in some 
[02:57:30]  of those things.  Then it just kind of, like, made its way into the music and doing events and different things  to try to support some of those causes.  Any regrets or no?  No, definitely not.  I mean, I think that's, in some ways, that's the most fulfilling stuff to do.  If you're able to sort of use that, you know, some public position or attention that you  have to try and bring some light to something that needs it, then, you know, that's great. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, I don't think you're going to catch much flack on the Tibet issue.  I mean, that's pretty straightforward.  But the free Mumia thing, did you catch a lot of flack?  Definitely, yeah.  I mean, there were a lot of cops that, like, I would have cops come up to me after that and  be like, oh, you guys hate cops.  You're like, no, we don't.  You know, I think there was a real feeling that somehow we hated cops because we were  supporting Mumia getting a fair trial.  But really, I mean, we were just supporting.  I think some people looked at it from the perspective that we were supporting a cop killer. 
[02:58:30]  But I think what we were really supporting is that everybody has the right to a fair trial.  Do you think they're going to execute him?  They're not going to execute him, but do you think he's going to get out?  Or what do you think is going to happen?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you think about the Olympics being held in China?  I think it's definitely very interesting.  I think it's, you know, I think that the Tibetan people that are demonstrating now inside Tibet  are, it's incredible how brave they are and how much they're putting themselves at risk 
[02:59:00]  by doing this.  It's not like you or me going out to a demonstration on the street here.  I mean, they risk being shot at or imprisoned or tortured.  And so it's really amazing that those people are putting themselves on the line.  And I just hope that some change comes out of this.  Yeah, it's odd to have the Olympics, you know, supposed to be this bring the world together  thing in a country that's so oppressive to its people.  Yeah, but I mean, there's a tradition of people, of countries boycotting the Olympics. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  You think the United States should or?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it's definitely a good time to bring attention to this.  I think the main thing is that China needs to open up and allow the press to go inside  Tibet and see what's going on and allow the United Nations to go inside there.  I think the idea that China has shut the media out of Tibet is really scary. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, I think it's the only way they can really keep a rain on their people and, you know,  keep them under control.  I mean, that's what they think.  They think that's the only way that they can do it.  But I think realistically, you know, if they want to participate in the Olympics, they  obviously want to participate in being citizens of the world.  And I think they need to conduct themselves in accordance with the rest of the world.  But I mean, to China's credit, at least for the first couple of days of the demonstrating, 
[03:00:30]  they didn't shoot anybody.  They didn't attack.  And so it seems like it sounds extreme.  It sounds crazy, but at least it seems like there was some room there where China was  approaching it in a more constructive way.  And hopefully it'll go back to that again, you know.  I think because they're under such scrutiny, because the Olympics are going to be there.  And I also think that they want to be part of the world, not so much in, I don't know, 
[03:01:00]  some civilized humanitarian fashion as much as in some economic fashion.  I think they enjoy the money that they're getting from the rest of the world.  But I really don't think they enjoy taking care of their people and human rights and things  like that.  It's an abomination.  I think one of the scariest parts of it is that China controls the media so much.  And so they were just running the, you know, there were some isolated incidents where Tibetans 
[03:01:30]  did attack Chinese people or burn Chinese stores inside Tibet.  But I think there were just a few incidents of it.  But the Chinese news kept running it over and over and over again in China.  And it built up a lot of animosity from young Chinese people in China towards Tibetans.  And then it's building all this racial tension.  And so I think it's definitely going on a real negative path.  And hopefully, you know, China needs to loosen up on the media front. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  You're still as physically involved with these causes as you were when you were a little younger?  I still go to demonstrations.  And yeah, I mean...  But you think it out a little more now that...  Because I know, you know, you do certain things when you're younger.  Then you get a little older and you're like,  Hey, do I really want to go to jail for this tonight?  I'm kind of busy.  I would.  I'd be willing to go to jail for it.  If it was the, you know, the right time and the right place.  If it seemed like it was really going to help the situation and what's going on over there. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  The other guys in the band back you on a lot of the stuff?  Yeah.  They go, dude, what are you doing?  Come on, we've got a gig.  No, no.  They've been really supportive.  Yeah.  Are you the most political or is it kind of like all three pretty fairly equal partners in it?  I think we're all pretty interested in political things.  I think maybe more specifically Tibet is something that I took an interest in.  But I think those guys also have similar feelings about other things in the world. 
[03:03:00]  It must have been coming up.  And of course, we all like there must have been a tremendous amount of sex and groupies.  Because you guys really were...  Do you have that question written down or is this off the top of your head?  That's off the top.  All I have is I think I sabotaged the name of the album.  I said Lice and Sale, right?  Lice and Sale.  I was right.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, you said Sabotage.  No, the song Sabotage, yeah.  All right, good.  I thought I had that right.  And I'm like, oh, that I fucked it up.  And I was kind of ignoring myself because I'm a Black Sabbath fan. 
[03:03:30]  But no, that was what I would ask.  Because you guys are kind of seen as pioneers.  I mean, you weren't just like, you know, you mentioned Curtis Blow.  You mentioned LL Cool J, who are all very good.  But to me, they don't historically stand out as pioneers the way you guys do.  So I'm saying there must have been a tremendous amount of sexual favors for them.  I'm not sure where this is going.  That's where it goes.  That's all.  That's all.  He's just giving you a little pat on the back, I think.  Okay, good. 
[03:04:00]  Actually, you know, I guess when you're in that scene, when you guys first broke, there  was probably a lot of temptation and stuff around as far as drugs and chicks and things  like that.  Was that something you guys partook in?  I mean, the way I look at it is kind of like when we were a hardcore band, I mean, I was  like a straight-edge kid.  Really?  I didn't smoke, didn't drink, you know.  And kind of like at some point, like a little bit later, like going to college, I just kind 
[03:04:30]  of started like drinking, like goofing around.  And almost like when License to Ill hit, I think it was like kind of almost like we were  making fun of like frat-type culture.  And then, you know, you get to that point where you make fun of something enough and  you just sort of like become it.  Right, right.  You know, and so I think we kind of like crossed that line.  We were kind of like imitating this idea of like, and we had some idea of like middle 
[03:05:00]  America and drinking Budweiser, you know, like, and before you knew it, that's who we  were.  That's so odd because a lot of people, especially rappers, like to say that they're rapping  about their experiences.  And with you guys, it's almost the opposite.  You know, you start goofing around and writing songs about things and you kind of turn into  it.  I think we've done that a bunch of times.  You started goofing on something and then sort of like became it.  And then, you know, you get a little older, I guess, and start taking up some causes, 
[03:05:30]  get a little serious.  Yeah.  Who knew?  Yeah.  Who knew?  I know.  It's like, God, how long can we be called the Beastie Boys?  Exactly.  There's so many, you know, I guess you didn't think you'd be around that long ago.  Yeah, no, I've been trying to switch the name up to the Disco Three.  The Disco Three.  Yeah.  You know, the Fat Boys used to be called the Disco Three, but yeah, they changed their names  to the Fat Boys.  So we were hoping we could, you know, option that.  Yeah.  Well, they really fell.  What happened to the Fat Boys?  Finally, somebody who knows, because like they were very popular for a while and then 
[03:06:00]  you just never heard from them again.  Are they dead or did they just quit the business?  Seriously, I...  Yeah, no, one of them did die.  Oh, he did die.  Okay.  Is that what stopped them or was that like long after?  I'm not sure.  I think they might have broken up before that, but actually, they were pretty nice MCs.  I mean, there were some guys that got into doing a lot of like really goofy, ridiculous  records, but actually like they're pretty nice MCs.  And Human Beatbox was pretty good too.  I mean, it's interesting. 
[03:06:30]  Dougie Fresh kind of came along though and made him look a little irrelevant.  I think that's what happened.  Well, Dougie Fresh came first.  Oh, did he?  Okay.  Yeah.  But no, I mean, those guys, they're a good example of they made some records where they  were kind of like making fun of themselves and doing some real kind of like cliche stuff.  And that's the stuff that really got publicized.  But if you, you know, they do have some good songs.  Do you like, was there anybody who gave you like, because you've had obviously a lot of  guys you worked with run DMC.  Was there anybody that kind of was shitty to you? 
[03:07:00]  I mean, there must have been somebody who resented the fact that three white guys were  coming along and getting so much airplay and so much like, you know, uh, so much attention.  So the question is who shit on the Beastie Boys?  Or who didn't want to accept you?  Yeah.  Who didn't want to accept you?  Who tried to shit on us?  Yeah.  Or yeah.  Was there anybody that just didn't seem to want to accept you?  I think there might've been a period of time, like shortly after License to Ill was, was  so successful and, and the, the breakout single from, uh, from License to Ill being Fight  for Your Right to Party. 
[03:07:30]  I think that it's almost like, like Beastie Boys were, were really accepted by, by the  black community early on.  Like songs like Hold It Now were played on, on black radio and, uh, and really accepted.  And I think with the, the extreme success of Fight for Your Right to Party, I think there  were some people that were like, you know, who, who the hell are these white boys?  What is this?  You know, which understandably was, uh, we were on some bullshit.  So understand, I know, but, uh, I think, I think most of that sort of dissipated after 
[03:08:00]  a while.  You, uh, at some point you guys decided to, um, pick up instruments too and, and actually  start playing.  Yeah.  I mean, in a way it's something that we went back to because we did start out as a  hardcore.  Yeah.  And, uh, but people didn't know that.  I don't think a lot of the majority of the people knew that and they were like, what  the fuck are they doing?  You know?  Yeah.  So then we started rhyming.  We, and Licensed to Ill was really a rap record, Paul's Boutique.  And you know what I mean?  We played some of the, some of the backing tracks on Licensed to Ill stuff and on things 
[03:08:30]  on Paul's Boutique.  But really, I think we really integrated it as part of what we were doing and playing  instrumental songs and, uh, on Check Your Head, you know, because we listened to a  lot of like jazz records and funk records in the process of, uh, of finding stuff  to sample.  And so I think with Check Your Head, we sort of got interested in playing some of that  kind of music.  Yeah.  You were going out though and touring with the instruments and playing live on stage  or?  Not during, like Licensed to Ill and Paul's Boutique.  We did a little, a bit in the studio, but, uh, but we didn't live at all. 
[03:09:00]  And with Check Your Head, when we toured for that album, we, we did break the instruments  out again.  Yeah.  That must've been, uh, something had that work out.  It was cool.  Yeah.  It was good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People, uh, like it.  Cause I know, I know it kind of got a weird reaction from people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They didn't tell me.  I remember that.  Yeah.  That seemed like a good, a good reaction to me.  Yeah.  So you guys are still doing gigs together, right?  Yeah.  Any festivals or anything?  Still doing it. 
[03:09:30]  Working on a new album or anything?  Yeah.  We're actually recording now.  Yeah.  Very cool.  And what do you think of today's music scene in general and rap, I guess, the rap scene?  Um, I mean, it's quite, it's quite different than when you guys began, obviously, but you've  been able to adapt, uh, the whole way through.  But I think there's still interesting stuff being made.  I think it's, I mean, one thing about hip hop is that it evolves so fast, much faster  than, than rock music.  I think rock music much more tends to, uh, to stagnate and do the same thing over and 
[03:10:00]  over again.  And, uh, but hip hop's not like that.  I mean, I mean, records that are a month old are old.  It's already an old record.  And, uh, you don't have that same kind of nostalgia for old hip hop in the hip hop community  as, uh, as people do with, with rock much more.  Like you don't have your, like, Led Zeppelins or Beatles or bands like that as much.  They get chewed up and spit out real fast.  Your stuff really, uh, stood the test of time though, because you can listen to some older 
[03:10:30]  Beastie Boys and it doesn't sound like listening to old hip hop.  You know, it's old hip hop, you know?  So, I mean, it really sounds dated and stuff.  Yeah, I mean, some hip hop holds up.  I still go back and listen to, to some really public enemy records.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The Nation of Millions is like one of the most powerful rap albums ever made.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's, uh, it really is cool that you guys still getting, you know, a lot of airplay  and, uh, it's still, you know, it's still relevant.  Very cool.  Who do you think is the best right now?  In hip hop? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  I love Jay-Z, man.  I still love Jay-Z records.  Yeah, he's pretty amazing.  I don't know about, I don't know.  Best is such a weird word, but I definitely, most of the time when I hear Jay-Z records,  and Nas, too.  I definitely like hearing Nas records.  Is Eminem as good as people say he is, or does he get more play because he's a white  guy?  No, he's a really strong MC.  I think he's good.  He faded fast, though, huh?  That's hip hop right there.  He faded right out of the scene.  That's what it is.  Yeah, it seems like he's kind of...  Now he's having all sorts of issues.  He's gained a lot of weight.  Eminem? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'm saying that like I can't believe he got fat.  Yeah.  Yeah, he hasn't been around in a while now, believe it or not.  I think he's working on a new record, though.  Is he?  I wouldn't be surprised if he jumps back up.  I would love to see what he comes out with next.  So getting back to the movie, gunning for that number one spot.  We really haven't discussed it, so what can you tell us about it?  Well, it's really centered around this all-star game that takes place up at the Rucker in Harlem.  And it's high school kids, like the top high school kids from around the country coming together to compete in this tournament. 
[03:12:00]  And we focus on eight of those guys.  We go and profile eight of them in their hometowns and meet their families and trainers and the people around them and their friends as they're kind of like preparing to come to the Rucker.  So you kind of get to know these different players in the world that they live in.  And I'm definitely not making this sound as interesting as the film is, but the film is good.  And interestingly enough, some of the players that we profile are people who are probably going to be NBA superstars in the near future. 
[03:12:30]  Michael Beasley is one of them.  Michael Beasley is predicted to be the number one draft pick in June.  Jared Bayless has also made himself eligible for the draft.  Kevin Love, Kyle Singler.  I think there are four of the guys who have made themselves eligible for the draft. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, that'd be interesting if you get one of the guys and they actually become a star in the NBA.  I think they probably will.  I mean, these guys are incredible players.  Yeah, documentary of a career.  Absolutely.  And I think it'll be interesting to look back at this documentary years from now and see these guys when they're still in high school.  Oh my God, he was in this movie?  And he's now an NBA superstar.  Where's the movie going to be shown?  Well, in New York, it'll be at Magic Johnson Theater uptown and it'll be on 12th Street or is it 11th Street?  Which one is it?  Like 3rd Avenue and, you know, over by the Ritz over there. 
[03:13:30]  Right, okay.  Webster Hall, whatever they call it these days.  Whatever the children are calling.  I don't know.  It'll be in different theaters around the country.  A couple phone calls before we let you go if you want to get the headphones near your ear anyway.  Ryan in Wisconsin, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I just love you, love the show.  I just wanted to ask Adam, with the heavy sampling of Led Zeppelin on License to Ill, if you've ever met any of the people involved with Led Zeppelin, like Page or Plant or anything like that. 
[03:14:00]  All right, you know, this is a good story.  I was actually backstage at Live Aid, the first big Live Aid.  And somehow I, like, snuck back there.  I, like, borrowed a pass from somebody.  And I was kind of trying to, like, hide out somewhere so that I wouldn't get thrown out for having the wrong kind of pass.  And all of a sudden, this area that I was in, like, Led Zeppelin walk in, and they're, like, hanging out, like, drinking beers in this kind of, like, outdoor area.  And then the Rolling Stones walk into the area, and they all started, like, giving each other hugs and, like, talking to each other. 
[03:14:30]  And so I was sort of, like, stunned for a minute to see all these superstars.  Just trying not to get thrown out of the area, yeah.  Just kind of hiding in some corner.  That's pretty cool.  Jeff in Arizona, what's up?  Hey, yo.  Oh, hey.  Love you, love the show.  I want to let Adam know about the Punk Rock days and how much I actually still appreciate it.  I listen to it for, well, still do.  And one of my questions is, does he still listen to Punk Rock? 
[03:15:00]  Are you still about the hardcore?  And is there a chance we can ever see a hardcore album again?  Yeah, I mean, I do still listen to hardcore, but interestingly enough, I still listen to probably, like, old hardcore from when I was, like, you know, like, 16 years old.  Can you name some?  What's that?  Can you name some?  Some of your influences there, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I still listen to that early Bad Brain stuff, like that Roar tape I listen to all the time.  The first couple Minor Threat EPs, those first two 7-inches. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, XM has a Funk is 53.  Yeah, I listen to that.  Actually, I listen to that a lot, too.  That's for good.  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah, you mean Lars, Joe, right?  Love you.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Cleveland.  Jeremy, what's up?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  I had a question for Adam.  Back then in the 90s, with the earlier lyrics of Raffi coming about, you know, rapping about big screens, 40s blunts and bitches,  is how hard was it to keep the lyrics, like, you know, kind of clean and friendly like you guys had always had them? 
[03:16:00]  I don't know that I would necessarily vouch for our lyrics being clean and friendly.  But maybe some, I don't know.  I think we just, we rhyme about whatever seems interesting to us, you know, and maybe at some point in the near future, you know, flat screens and whatever else may seem interesting.  I think it's not that interesting to me at the moment.  Let's go to Boise.  Kelly, what's up? 
[03:16:30]  Hey, love everything you guys have been doing.  My question is, who, wow, full of brain dead.  Who decided, or came up with the idea to reverse the bass line on Paul Revere?  Um, I think I did, actually.  I'm just going to blow my own horn here.  Yeah.  Because it was cool, you know, it was something different, and I used to take my tapes out, flip them around, just to hear what the bass line was. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, it's actually not a bass line, that's actually an 808, a Roland 808 drum machine, and 808s have this crazy kick drum that sustains, so the kick drum kind of goes like boom, and it holds for a long time.  And so, yeah, I just thought it would be interesting to, I had been talking about it for a while, this idea of, like, playing the 808 backwards to see what it sounded like, and one time we kind of.  It was killer. 
[03:17:30]  Ah, thanks.  Nothing more I can say.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, I think we all felt that way.  I appreciate everything you guys have done.  Actually, Run DMC, we're in the room with us, and we were making that beat, and we flipped the beat over, and I think everybody kind of, like, all looked at each other, like, oh, my God, that sounds incredible.  We actually, in those days, it was on a two-inch, and we flipped the two-inch over, played it backwards.  All right, thank you, Kelly.  Thank you.  We got to take a break, but Adam, thanks for stopping by.  It's Gunning for the number one spot.  It comes out June 27th.  Yeah.  I'm actually a Hoops fan. 
[03:18:00]  I'll definitely check this one out.  Cool, all right.  Thanks for having me on.  All right, man.  Thanks for coming.  Hi.  Adam Yonk from the Beastie Boys.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Responsible parents everywhere.  Opie and Anthony are now back on the regular airwaves.  So take your baby off that windowsill and sit him in front of the radio.  To hear the shriek of a small child, that would be wonderful.  Opie and Anthony Dash, bring in the funny.  Bring in the funny.  Bring in the funny.  Back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:18:30]  I want to thank Adam Yonk for stopping by from the Beastie Boys.  The movie's Gunning for that number one spot.  Not the most memorable of interviews, not the most memorable of interviews, and now we get to tell you why, without giving too much away.  I just before Adam, poor Adam actually, walked into the studio, it was brought to my attention that Chauncey Hayden, who's pretty much obsessed with me at this point, has another article about me that comes out, I guess, tomorrow. 
[03:19:00]  And this article is so ridiculous, I read it just before Adam walked into the studio and completely lost my shit, broke equipment in here, and then I sat down and I pretty much was trying not to bite my own face off.  And then Anthony and Jimmy, you know, I was hiding behind equipment because I didn't want Adam to feel uncomfortable, but I was completely losing my mind. 
[03:19:30]  And there's an article coming out tomorrow on Steppin' Out Magazine where I'm being called the asshole of the week by Chauncey Hayden, someone who's very, very obsessed with me.  He's a dirty journalist.  Only a week, though?  Huh?  Only a week?  He's a dirty journalist.  He's a lying journalist.  He's a dishonest journalist.  And someday he will get his because, you know, it's becoming very obvious to many people in the know that this guy is just dirty.  Simple as that. 
[03:20:00]  So, he's got an article coming out tomorrow that says Asshole of the Week, and it reads as follows.  Greg Opie Hughes of the Opie and Anthony 92.3 KROQ radio show, the lowest radio morning show in New York City.  That's the first lie right there, by the way.  If you want, you know, we'll go through some of the lies in this whole fucking thing.  The lowest rated morning show in New York City.  That's not true.  There are people much lower than our morning radio show here in New York.  He's furious at me for publishing a story about an alleged sex tape starring his fiancée, Lindsay. 
[03:20:30]  Lindsay, and he gets her name wrong, so that's the second false info.  He calls her Lindsay O'Grotton.  Who the hell is Lindsay O'Grotton?  I don't know, but I had some the other night with a steak.  It was wonderful.  So, there's more misinformation by this wonderful journalist.  Jeez.  And MTV's favorite jackass, Bam Margera.  There's only one problem.  It's not the favorite, by the way.  Huh?  Steve-O or Johnny Knoxville. 
[03:21:00]  We're probably.  Would be favorites, so there's another one.  Well, no, that's his opinion, though.  You know, you can't...  But, I mean, to get her name wrong, you can't even do the simple, you know, fact-checking.  Bam Alfredo?  There's only one problem.  Cheesy dish joke?  Thank you, Bam.  I'm a douche.  I don't give a shit, but let me at least read through this.  There's only one problem.  Dopey Opie never bothered to pick up a copy of Steppin' Out. 
[03:21:30]  I wouldn't even know where to pick up a copy of Steppin' Out magazine.  Why?  There's only one problem.  Dopey Opie never bothered to pick up a copy of Steppin' Out.  Steppin' On.  Try your feet.  To see what the story reported, or even if the story had ever been published.  It hadn't until now.  First of all, I don't know where to find Steppin' Out magazine.  I don't go out of my way to read it.  Why would I read your crap?  I think it's in those little newspaper things with all the queer papers in it. 
[03:22:00]  And where you can, like, get some filthy pussy for, like, five bucks.  Maybe.  I really wouldn't even...  I'm not even kidding.  I wouldn't even know where to find this magazine.  Like, this is what I do when I'm not doing radio.  Search out Steppin' Out magazine.  Why would I do that?  I know that you're full of lies and deceit, and you're dishonest.  Why would I read your crap?  I would have to assume that half the stuff you write in your columns are bullshit.  He's a little jealous because he doesn't get the attention he wants. 
[03:22:30]  Last one.  And this is where...  This is the only thing I'm mad at.  I mean, you could call me asshole of the week.  You could say how, like, people that used to work for the radio show hate my guts.  Whatever.  Talk...  All right.  Talk all you want about me.  I don't give a shit.  But what really is pissing me the fuck off is this.  A picture?  He says, last week, Paige, do you really want...  I'll just...  Dude, I'm just trying to fucking around.  But you know what?  Sometimes it's a real moment.  Just fucking go with the real moment. 
[03:23:00]  You're not going through this fucking bullshit.  Dude, I've been through so much fucking shit involved in this show.  Lighten up.  I'm trying to fucking keep it light.  I don't want to keep this light.  All right?  Do what you want.  There's no reason to keep this light.  Do what you want.  You know he's a fuck...  Yell at me.  Throw headphones at Jimmy.  We're the fucking assholes.  Fuck this, then.  I didn't...  First of all, I didn't throw the...  I already explained that.  I didn't throw the...  You're fucking being an asshole.  I didn't throw the headphones at fucking Jimmy.  I explained.  You're giving me a fucking dick to us because you're pissed off at this fucking dude's face. 
[03:23:30]  No, no, because you're...  And we're assholes now?  Bullshit.  Dude, you're uncomfortable in making jokes.  There's not a time for jokes.  That's all.  It's a fucking dopey show.  Well, it's not fun right now.  I throw in jokes.  It's not fun right now, Anthony.  I'm letting you get the info out.  It's not fun.  You know we've talked behind the scenes and what this has done to me and my girl.  I understand.  I've been through shit like similar shit.  I understand.  It's not fun.  But we're not the bad fucking assholes here.  All I'm asking is not to make little jokes.  I want to have a moment here. 
[03:24:00]  And when I threw the headphones...  When I read this, I wasn't throwing them at Jimmy.  And I apologized immediately.  Didn't I apologize to you immediately?  I did not throw the headphones at you.  I swear to God.  I went to hit this fucking thing and they went flying over the thing.  And immediately I said I fucking didn't throw the headphones at you.  This is a real moment that's going on.  I got a girl at home that is this close to a fucking nervous breakdown because she doesn't deserve this shit.  I understand.  Fuck, say whatever you want about me. 
[03:24:30]  I don't care.  But my chick doesn't deserve this shit.  I know.  And what happened was this is a fucking false rumor, a lie that was started a year and a half ago by someone.  We all know his name.  And fucking Chauncey was the one that fed this fucking story to page six and made them believe that this could be possibly true.  And now I'm in living fucking hell.  Everybody knows in my little circle that it's not true.  But there's a lot of people out there still wondering what the fuck is going on with this shit. 
[03:25:00]  Okay, read it and I'll shut the fuck up.  Well, no, I mean, but just don't needle me.  That's all I'm asking.  I wasn't needling you.  I was trying to add a little levity.  Dude, there's been times with you with personal stuff on the show.  I'm right there with you.  Right there.  Okay?  I'm right there.  I read you.  Believe me.  And I don't want to bring up stuff.  But all I want to say is when you go down a serious road, I'm right there with you.  I read you and go, wow, this is pretty heavy shit.  And I'm there just to kind of support and listen to what you have to say. 
[03:25:30]  And right now, I'm completely on edge.  And I apologize if, like, you're throwing in your jokes.  I just don't want to hear it right now.  Because this guy is a complete asshole.  And the more research I've done, I can't even tell you the embarrassment.  Because now I'm doing a lot of research behind the scenes.  I'm up to 20 names of people I know that this guy told this rumor to behind my back.  Just trying to get this rumor out there and trying to get as many people possible to believe this. 
[03:26:00]  Got message boards to believe it.  Where these message boards go into private areas and discuss, well, is the tape real?  Does anyone know anything on it?  Let's try to find this fucking tape.  There's no fucking tape.  But now I have to clean up this mess, no matter what it takes.  So he continues, because I'm the asshole of the week.  Last week, page six of the New York Post published an item that yours truly was planning on running a story on the alleged sex tape in an upcoming issue.  Page six was correct.  What does that mean?  Page six was correct. 
[03:26:30]  What does that mean?  However, what Opie failed to do was return my request for a comment regarding the sex tape rumor.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  No one called me.  No one called Anthony.  No one called Jim Norton.  No one called Bob Eatman, our agent.  No one called XM Satellite Radio.  They have a whole fucking media department that deals with this shit.  They have publicists and stuff.  No one called Karen Mateo, who fucking takes all this stuff for CBS corporate. 
[03:27:00]  We didn't get any fucking calls or emails.  So I don't know what the hell he's talking about.  Of course, I would have yelled and screamed and said, what are you kidding me?  This is a rumor that was started by a disgruntled employee a year and a half ago.  He says, however, what Opie failed to do was return my request for a comment regarding the sex tape rumor.  Instead, he chose to humiliate.  This is why I can't take fucking jokes today.  Instead, he chose to humiliate his fiancee by using the item as a ratings grabber and turning a small mention in page six into two days of on-air fireworks. 
[03:27:30]  A small mention in page six, I hate to tell you, for the rest of the country, that's the one page everybody reads that they're going to pick up a fucking newspaper.  It's not something that's buried near the obituaries or the wedding announcements.  It's not a small little thing.  When it's in page six and it's outlined in a big box, it's a pretty fucking big deal.  And I want to make it perfectly clear I didn't use this to try to grab ratings.  I would never do that.  Anyone who knows me knows that I wouldn't do that with my chick. 
[03:28:00]  Opie even went so far as to lie about the time.  And then he brings this fucking thing up again.  Opie even went so far to lie about the time.  He called me on the phone several hours after I interviewed both him and his partner, Anthony Cumia, for Penthouse Magazine and asked if I would change one of their answers.  The question was, who invented Whip Them Out Wednesday?  First of all, it's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Second of all, I proved my point by just reading his fucking words that come out tomorrow.  Anthony answered, we both did. 
[03:28:30]  Later that day, Opie called my office and cried how sick he was of Anthony always saying, we invented wow.  He asked that I change the answer to read.  And I quote, I invented wow years before Anthony and I met, proving what a fucking liar this motherfucker is.  Because anyone could go and do the research.  Everyone knows Anthony and I invented wow when we were at WAAF in Worcester, Massachusetts.  It's a known fact.  I didn't invent this before I met Anthony. 
[03:29:00]  Everyone knows that.  Because if I invented it before I met Anthony, I would have been using it on my radio show before I started doing radio with Anthony.  So right there, Chauncey, you proved my fucking point.  A lie right in your fucking article.  I invented wow years before Anthony and I met.  Everybody knows.  There's articles proving that we invented it up at WAAF.  We're on TV talking about it.  Which I gladly did.  Last week, Opie denied the call ever took place. 
[03:29:30]  Really?  All we need to do is read the interview, the January 2001 issue of Penthouse for confirmation.  No, I called him because I had problems with the article he initially wrote.  And this is why I've had a problem with him ever since.  There were a lot of fucking misleading info in the article he did with Anthony and I originally.  And I had a problem with that.  He had us competing against a guy here in New York that didn't even start yet when we officially did the interview.  But by the time the interview came out, months later, we were now officially competing against this guy.  Rocky Allen, I do believe, if I'm not fucking mistaken. 
[03:30:00]  But getting back to the subject at hand, the alleged sex tape.  Two weeks ago, I was contacted by a former staff member who informed me that there was a sex tape involving Opie's fiancee and Bam Margera.  And that the tape, allegedly now owned by another former staff member of the Opie and Anthony Shove, there is no fucking tape.  No one owns a fucking tape.  And he has to put that in there just to get another fucking jab in.  Was going to be sold on the internet in the coming weeks.  And that was spread by another disgruntled employee that even set up a fucking website saying this is where the tape's going to be. 
[03:30:30]  Well, guess what?  That guy has gone into hiding because he knows it's not fucking true.  Was going to be sold on the internet in the coming weeks.  I was told that Lindsay and Bam were doing the nasty on the videotape and that it made and it was made prior to Opie meeting Lindsay.  Since the page six item came out, all parties involved have denied the tape exists, which I tend to believe.  Now he believes this.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chauncey.  Thank you.  You believed the whole time that the tape didn't exist. 
[03:31:00]  But you knew you could get away with handing this story over to page six, which I tend to believe since nobody has come forward to present the tape to the media.  But the question now has to be asked, what do so many ex-staffers hate Opie so much that they feel the need to embarrass him any chance they get?  No, this all started with one fucking guy a year and a half ago.  And he got other guys that have been fired from the show to join in on it.  Of course they would.  Well, judging from the lies Opie so easily tells over his airways, from this reporter's perspective, it's easy to see why. 
[03:31:30]  And then he has my picture, you know, and he even picked the worst shot ever taken of me, whatever, and writes,  The Opie and Anthony show is now officially the lowest rated morning radio show in New York City, with a 1.7 ratings behind Fresh.  So there you go.  Just wanted to get my point out there. 
[03:32:00]  These motherfuckers.  These motherfuckers.  And everyone knows who started this.  Everyone knows.  I'm not allowed to say his name on the radio right now.  And he started a year and a half ago.  He was texting me around the clock for weeks on end, and I wouldn't budge.  The only text I ever wrote back to this guy was, get help, because I'm like, wow, you are damaged.  What the fuck is going on?  You need help.  And then finally he started, you know, he goes, Lindsay, sex tape, do I have your attention now? 
[03:32:30]  And I read this thing like, oh my God, who the fuck is ever going to believe this?  Fast forward a year and a half later, this motherfucker was able to convince people to go to page six and have them fucking print this thing.  And now I'm in hell.  Now I'm in hell.  Because of my chick, not because of me.  Say whatever the fuck you want about me.  And it's been embarrassing the last week, because I'm calling a lot of people that we know.  And everyone's coming forward.  Oh my God, he would call me up in the middle of the night and tell me about this and that. 
[03:33:00]  And he said he had stuff on me, he had stuff on Ant, he had stuff on Eric Logan.  I don't think, so far he doesn't have anything on you, Jimmy.  But the big get was this, of course, sex tape.  I'm fucking frustrated, man. 
[03:33:30]  I'm fucking frustrated.  I'm fucking frustrated.  Hello?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?
