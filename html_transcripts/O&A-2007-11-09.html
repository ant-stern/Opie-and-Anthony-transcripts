<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing their controversial on-air personas and the hypocrisy of being expected to be "nice."  They then launched into typical Friday greetings, riffing on clichés and end-of-week songs. Opie recounted attending the New York Comedy Festival, seeing Dennis Leary (performing new songs "Rehab" and "Presidential Blues"), Bob Kelly, Rich Voss (who brought his newborn backstage), and Jim Jefferies (a future guest).  They discussed Voss's comedic style and perceived paranoia. The conversation shifted to the NYC writer's strike, with Opie describing the picket line outside Time Warner, highlighting the disparity in attention given to celebrity appearances (Roseanne, Robin Williams, Dave Duchovny, Susie Essman, and Richard Belzer, who joked about needing writers for his dog) versus the writers themselves.  The impact of internet broadcasts and DVDs on writers' compensation was also discussed, alongside Opie's disdain for CNN.  The possibility of creating their own internet show was briefly considered before transitioning to "F-You Friday," where Opie targeted CNN and Jane Seymour, and Anthony targeted drivers.  A listener call followed, leading into a discussion about the upcoming "Eggnog Drinking Challenge."  Shaq's divorce and the perceived unfairness of divorce laws were debated, using Shaq's and Paul McCartney's cases as examples.  Various news items were covered: a 911 beer call, a principal caught in women's clothing, J.Lo's pregnancy announcement, and a driving instructor's "carrot story."  Listener calls interspersed discussions of reactions to the "Two Girls One Cup" video and a "Baby Bird" video contest.  Past eggnog challenge highlights, including Sergeant Magoo's vomit-and-Fruit Loops incident, were recounted as being even more repulsive than "Two Girls One Cup."  More listener calls and discussions of Bigfoot and a listener's lost-in-the-woods experience concluded this segment.

The next segment began with an update on Boston radio personalities Toucher and Rich, who were reportedly banned from drinking at events.  This led to humorous commentary on Toucher's past intoxicated appearances.  A caller recounted Bob Kelly's unfinished werewolf story from Iraq, sparking speculation about Kelly's mental state. A serious call from Tom in White Plains followed, detailing his life-threatening heart and lung condition and his contemplated suicide if it worsened.  The tone shifted to somber acknowledgment of the gravity of the situation. The conversation then veered to "Man Town," a segment from another radio show, after which Bill Burr joined the studio. Burr shared anecdotes about Mark Maron and his own stand-up, including a recent illness onstage.  The hosts, Burr, and callers debated the merits and absurdity of "Man Town." Listener calls followed, including a $1000 contest winner and discussions of fantasy football, Bruce Springsteen, *In Search Of…*, and a listener's horrifying family vacation to a cottage with a fire-related death.  Further segments covered a driving instructor convicted of sex crimes involving a carrot, multiple fatal wood chipper accidents, and China's legal battle with Vince McMahon.  The segment concluded with "F-You Friday" listener voicemails.

A subsequent segment featured a profanity-laden, rambling conversation centered on mocking the wrestling personality "China," with heavily offensive and sexually explicit language used by someone imitating Vince McMahon.  Insults targeted China's career, perceived gender, and a sex tape.  WWE anecdotes and a McMahon montage were included.  This transitioned to an outdoor segment with man-on-the-street interviews, featuring crude and offensive humor, including a woman claiming to work for David Letterman.  Bill Burr was mentioned, and Kevin Smith called in, discussing book sales, a potential Jim Norton movie role, and his podcast.  The writer's strike was discussed, with Smith offering insights.  A significant portion involved vulgar commentary on "Two Girls One Cup" and "Lemon Party," with Smith, Burr, and the hosts participating. A news segment showed a Pakistan brawl, with similarly crude commentary.  The excerpt concluded with discussion of Smith's projects and reactions to "The Kingdom."

The next segment focused on O.J. Simpson's court appearance, followed by a studio guest: a Brazilian woman and her boyfriend, Brian.  The conversation became sexually explicit, covering Brazilian fart porn and the woman's sexual history.  The hosts aggressively questioned her about the number of partners she'd had.  Kevin Smith called in. A "Strip Chicken" competition ensued between the Brazilian woman and a listener from Akron, Ohio, resulting in both women becoming topless on air.  Comments on their bodies and attire were made, along with descriptions of their boyfriends' reactions.  Technical difficulties with a PalTalk broadcast were also mentioned.  The segment concluded with banter about cars (hybrids) and the events of the show, interspersed with brief listener calls.  A near physical altercation involving a chess set was also noted.

The final segment started with a discussion about one host's new sweatshirt, followed by insults aimed at Bill Burr.  A conspiracy theory about George W. Bush and JFK Jr.'s assassination was mocked.  A video clip of a police interaction with an elderly black woman was played, with the woman's responses described as "genius."  A planned "radio war" with Than and Sam was discussed, with Than, Sam, Bronx Johnny, and Pepper Hicks in studio.  Extensive, vulgar trash-talking ensued, focusing on their respective styles and backgrounds.  A five-minute segment competition was planned.  The show ended with further banter, promotion, and a "Line of the Day" segment. Bill Burr was again a studio guest.

[00:08:00]  yesterday on on my way home thank you brothers yeah they were uh on the picket line just miserable  freezing their asses off with everybody else out there and i'm getting no attention because the  celebrities show up you know the rider strike is gonna be uh this is a biggie i was talking to  these guys it's a biggie well it's not anything they could hammer out quickly because uh the the  what they're looking for is something that's um kind of hard to figure out at a bargaining table  yeah it's not it's not this cut and dry stuff from years ago but you know hey we want more money 
[00:08:30]  uh we don't want to give you more money all right you sit at a table you hammer out a deal  uh this this is about internet broadcasts and uh dvd sales a lot of revenue streams that  have become huge since the last time these guys uh sat down and hammered out that contract in there  so but but there this is gonna be ugly this ain't going away anytime soon according to a lot of people  i was talking to yesterday down there well they keep saying like wow we're not sure how much if it's  a new technology it's just another case of uncreated people who don't want to give the people creating 
[00:09:00]  it the money they do i mean that's the way it always is but you know so you're saying that the  uh the corporate people are the creative ones yeah oh they're so good yeah and the writers should just  shut up that's right be happy you've got a job pick up your pen no that's that's rough man you  write something and then they just start selling it and not giving you anything for it yeah  but yesterday it's my stuff it's really awful yesterday they were in front of time warner i was  walking home and i walked right into it and uh so i hung out for a while and i was just observing and 
[00:09:30]  found it's so weird because you got the the writers that this really affects uh just walking  in circles for hours in the cold and then a celebrity shows up like roseanne showed up yeah  and all of a sudden the camera crews run interview roseanne she hangs out for two minutes and then  leaves and then the guys the writers who are really affected by this continue walking in circles and  circles and circles and then robin williams shows up camera crews your strikes what am i going to do 
[00:10:00]  uh i i can't do a movie because uh we need the writers and all right shut up right just say it  fast people think it's funny but i felt bad for the the real guys the guys this is affecting because  the celebrities show up get all the tension and then leave yeah you know uh dave dachovny was there  same thing suzy essman do you think these celebrities are doing this just to keep their face  in the news like during this whole thing absolutely because it's a photo op yeah with the strike  going on like their face isn't going to be around they can't do the talk shows uh they they they can't 
[00:10:30]  do their tv shows so they kind of just got to pop up and go hey i'm still here there's such  attention needy people that's what i was uh that's exactly what i was observing yeah yeah they were  waiting for the cameras they did their thing made it look good until the cameras were moving on to  something else and then they kind of just left then they leave richard belzer was there with a dog  and i i heard the hackiest thing ever ms ms belzer i have no idea if he's married or not oh richard 
[00:11:00]  belzer was uh hanging with a dog and uh the paparazzi and the press was there and all sudden  uh richard's walking around he's not really walking because the other thing to do is not walk the circle  if you know where the camera crews are on one side so yeah just hang out there and all of a sudden  they'll go hey richard can we get a few words oh yeah yeah sure like he acts like oh you know oh i  didn't expect i didn't expect this even though these people are just sitting there waiting for their turn 
[00:11:30]  to go on camera that's why they won't walk because they don't want to miss their opportunity while  they're on the other side of the uh the strike line they could run through the knocking writers  over to get in front of the camera they absolutely would by the way stop groveling  yeah so uh so uh belzer's uh there with a dog and one of the reporters yells out hey richard is the  dog on strike too and i swear to you richard goes you know the dog can't say woof without a writer 
[00:12:00]  writing it first oh the cricket got hit by a car and the reporter actually went oh  and i i tried to be heard by going yuck i did it jimmy yuck you know you might have just ruined my  weekend that is just horrid so then i'm standing there a little longer and i'm thinking about what  i just saw and i'm and then it i felt like he set that whole thing up yeah because here's the other 
[00:12:30]  thing when all these celebrities show up at something they get interviewed it's not a guarantee  that it's going to actually make your tv no now they're competing with other celebrities too  they're competing for the best uh soundbite so they all need kind of an angle and i i truly believe  with all my soul that richard belzer set that up knowing he was going to say that line because no  knowing someone was going to go wow is your dog on strike two because i noticed you're the only one  with a dog every day he goes to the pound gets a new dog at night once the interviews are done 
[00:13:00]  he slits its throat in central park and throws it in the lake it's a new dog the next day he's  trying to write something about him and a dog but he can't because there's no right it's frustrating  he kills the animal kills the dog just chokes him with a piano wire because the dog can't write it  just looks at him stupidly hungry and it wants love and he hates it bites his paws  the cnn people uh came up to me and uh you know that julie uh mose moss whatever the one that got 
[00:13:30]  us in trouble for the voyeur bus yeah yeah she jumped on the bus while it was making its way down  to the mayor's office so the so the you know the young teen girls could shower in front of the you  know the mayor's uh office there why not yeah back in the day we were really smart and uh you gotta  uh and they asked me for some comments about the writer's strike for the julie moss moses show and  i go i don't talk to cnn that's what i said that's good well that's because of the paul is on 
[00:14:00]  f those people f them hard man they did everything they could to get us fired for uh you know the  last controversy we were in apparently that's paul is on's uh motto too get f hard yeah married lady  are you married lady are you she was a naughty one that paul i'm done with jane seymour and now i go  f cnn f them i think this is a good opportunity for people um who have uh shows on youtube and uh 
[00:14:30]  break and uh myspace and things like that of course you're looking at myspace today but people are going  to be looking for some original material some good stuff to watch and the internet's there yeah so  it's uh there's there's a lot of options it's not like where your tv uh is running reruns and you're  just screwed basically what anthony is saying we're available we don't use writers listen to this crap  it's obvious we don't use writers we have a few ideas though you never know if this thing is dragged 
[00:15:00]  out i think we could get a get a little something something on tv i was ready to drag uh drag the camera  out just throw something up on one of the sites screw it yeah put the nbc logo on it  why not yeah we should do our own talk show yeah our own talk show for myspace oh see what i do for  you jimmy right myspace is in studio filming a little jimmy norton for his uh for his show tonight  right yeah what are they gonna do with this put a whole thing together on uh the internet i don't 
[00:15:30]  know they're probably setting up a humiliating section so they can put like biggest biggest flop of  year oh seven yeah i think so and all the secret stand-ups they had dane they had mencia  they're gonna have mine it's gonna have just three listeners waving their profiles and like me with  397 dvds left over no but this is the way it is this is good a lot of people don't come out on  fridays to go to shows you know i'll try to explain it away dude you're gonna have a sellout tonight 
[00:16:00]  seven o'clock carolines i keep saying sellout even though it's free because that's what i guess you  say when the place is packed you're gonna have a full house how's that i hope so for free be  embarrassing to have to bring those dvds home although if no one shows up hbo's giving them  away for free i will go and just sell them at my gig so stay home nothing more nothing sadder than  watching the comic at the end of the night with a hand truck and boxes of his cds going back to  his car trunk nothing better either yeah when it's not you it's hysterical i love standing there 
[00:16:30]  with kenny as he's yelling at people buy something uh spend money so jimmy can get a hooker and then  sometimes there's another comic there and it's just great watching them hold their cd and everyone's  just ignoring them and like kenny will yell for that you have a carnival barker yeah an oldie time  you gotta make him wear the curly handlebar mustache and the hat and the cane right this way step this  way ladies and gents uh well so here we go it's f you friday i i kicked it off i say f uh cnn

[00:26:30]  it's a picture in the paper jimmy yeah i don't know my name written somewhere i just said hey we have  another reaction to uh two girls one cup and this is going to lead to something that we're going to  ask our listeners to do to help us out okay oh don't don't get started until we tell you because  some listeners they hear uh two girls one cup and we want them to do something i see us uh getting  videos of no no them doing that of course not no you want to uh uh explain the two girls one cup 
[00:27:00]  thing oh it's wonderful it's uh two girls and uh one cup one of the girls uh fills the cup up  with um what could only be described as a thick creamy chocolate mousse and uh then the girls share  it in many different ways yeah yeah they share it during kissing um one of it uh one of uh the the 
[00:27:30]  girls uh has it in her mouth it looks like a melted milk dud and then um one girl actually vomits  into the other girl's face yeah yeah after uh eating the uh wonderful thick creamy viscous mousse  and the video is getting a lot of play on the internet if you do a if you do one of those like  google searches to see what people are searching for that uh two girls one cup come up comes up a lot  in the last few days but the newer phenomenon with this thing is not just watching it but recording 
[00:28:00]  people watching it yeah because it is so hard to sit through that uh people's reactions become  funny so people are now taping that throwing it on various sites and uh there you have it yeah the  video is just the reaction as someone's watching yeah two girls one cup you don't even see the video  two girls one cup you just see the reaction we got one from adam ferrari yesterday that was pretty  good he was horrified yeah we're trying to find that we got to get a copy of that but we also have 
[00:28:30]  three guys checking it out for the first time and this is how it went down you guys check out two  girls one cup okay yeah yeah do it go what the  that's disgusting  that's like peanut butter  no it can't be real 
[00:29:00]  no there's no wind  no there's no wind  that's not  i have a i have a feeling a lot of people are going to be doing this this weekend yeah they're 
[00:29:30]  going to be showing two girls one cup to to some people that have no clue what they're about to see  what was that music is that the music that's actually on the video i don't think so maybe  we've never really played i know you've never heard the sound or maybe and then yesterday we  had adam ferrari and who would like i said did great yesterday oh he i didn't mention adam ferrari  he was also uh part of uh leary and friends and he was awesome as well of course from rescue me  and a friend of this uh fine radio show and we showed adam uh two girls one cup this was his 
[00:30:00]  reaction oh yeah all right then we got to get adam's reaction to two girls one cup i will go to two  girls one cup adam have you ever seen this why is this every time i'm in the studio we do this which  one all right now uh get uh adam adam's reaction right all right now what am i looking at just watch  the video and let's be in a video act accordingly act accordingly it's just whatever whatever you feel  we gotta go full screen so this is two girls one cup two girls one cup with adam ferrari all right  nice nice right  nice right 
[00:30:30]  that's not real that's not real  oh that's not real look at it that is not real look wow i like the fact she's not even enjoying it  no no no no no no no that's not real he just doesn't want to believe it's real well a lot of 
[00:31:00]  people do that they go no that can't be real the phenomenon continues so one of our listeners decided  to do the exact same thing with the baby bird video which we're very proud of of course we are  that someone would come up with this idea that's our citizen cane it sure is if you haven't seen baby  bird yet uh go to go to break.com and punch in uh baby bird but what we're looking for because uh  the eggnog drinking challenge is right around the corner we want to start promoting it we need some 
[00:31:30]  viral marketing we're hoping that you guys can maybe take that video and show it to people that have  never seen it before and videotape their reaction to the baby bird video like people are doing with  two girls one cup and we want to get a few of those up on break.com and we'll promote the hell  out of your video if it's a really good one and i'm sure break will help us out at some of the other  video sites okay right and that'll help promote the eggnog drinking challenge which is coming soon  to the opian anthony show uh this one's probably not worth playing the guy kind of blew it even though  he came up with the idea you know who it was he should at least get credit because he made a 
[00:32:00]  he made a mistake he he plays the baby bird video for some people that have never seen it before  and they're reacting pretty good and uh he's laughing so hard that he can't really hear the  reaction of the people he was showing it to yeah he's got the camera probably smacked to the side of  his face right and uh he's laughing hysterical and you only pick up his audio of his cackling yeah  and uh the whole object is to get the people that haven't seen it their reaction and the baby bird  videos the great i call him the great pat from munaki pat from munaki after 72 or 73 double shots 
[00:32:30]  of eggnog uh during the eggnog drinking challenge last year uh he finally had to puke yeah and it  just kept coming and coming and coming to the point a lot of people still convinced that it's a fake  video some kind of hose attachment but no it's coming like right out of his mouth yeah you know it's  pretty obvious yeah for the people that think it's fake they're ridiculous and uh of course uh more  importantly landing it right into pat duffy's face yeah uh as pat duffy leans over a garbage pail like 
[00:33:00]  he's gonna get his hair shampooed right and uh there's pat just heaving away so we get some of  the best uh suggestions from the listeners unfortunately the execution from this guy  sucks but i think he came up with something that we really want to go with and have other people you  know videotape uh reactions to the baby bird video we'll get it up on these sites and we'll make  you a little video star okay yep 73 what is that 73 unbelievable yeah that's fun people can go 
[00:33:30]  from all over america 75 75 somebody set my tank out oh here it goes oh my god  the joker's in there 
[00:34:00]  so obviously it's a 
[00:34:30]  start joe from jersey came up with a great idea but you you know laughing kind of  messed uh messed up the whole  we get it you thought it was funny i kind of like the fact that dumb joe right  he's an idiot joe's just having so much fun his own revelry was more important 
[00:35:00]  than the production  so that's an example of what not to do but we like the idea joe good idea we like it i was watching along  uh watching the video yeah uh along with that audio of the baby bird and uh pat does this stance like  he's a superhero yeah he has his hands on his hips and he's he's lunging forward as he's uh vomiting  uh like some kind of uh superhero with puke powers look at him he's he's all like and he's proud of it 
[00:35:30]  like he's standing there ta-da pat from munaki so hopefully we'll get i'm not going anywhere with that i'm just sorry i got it looks that way  hopefully we'll get some more videos over the weekend and we'll start playing them on the air but  we'll also uh have some highlights from the egg not drinking challenge next week on the opian anthony show  especially a highlight that just didn't get the credit it deserves because uh last year was the  year of the baby bird video people forgot that sergeant magoo last year during the egg not drinking 
[00:36:00]  challenge did things that were so more horrific than what uh pat did you know what it is i don't think  it holds up on tape as well as baby bird does well because visually it's it's not as good but it was  so repulsive i don't think people ate breakfast yet so i think we could tell them real fast here  sergeant magoo was in the eggnog drinking challenge then he took one from the team and he uh made  himself puke into a beer pitcher oh and we're like what is he gonna do with that and then he broke out 
[00:36:30]  some what what was it fruit loops it was fruit loops fruit loops and then poured the eggnog vomit  onto the fruit loops and i gotta tell you it wasn't just this um like it wasn't like it came  back the way it went in it had completely curdled uh with with stomach acid i guess i don't so when  it came uh when he poured it back over the uh fruit loops it was like sour it looked like sour milk 
[00:37:00]  yeah and just stunk yeah and he spoons one luscious spoonful after another into his mouth and he would hold  a spoonful up and then it would it was coagulated yeah yeah false and that started it would make like  rubber band stringy yep and that started a chain reaction with the contestants and they started they  all started puking we almost didn't have a contest because of sergeant magoo he took out like half the  contestants yes his stomach oh my god i know isn't this just dude this is worse than the monarchy video 
[00:37:30]  yeah it is yeah but it just didn't get the the play like the baby bird and that's uh baby bird and  that same video is up on break yeah you could uh search it out but uh when he starts pouring it  over the fruit loops it's just it's just amazing this is more revolting to me than two girls one cup  yeah any of it yeah he's eating his own i'll never forget the thick stringy it's like what do you  eat magoo rubber bands and glue like he's pouring out to his roof i can't even i that i can't look at 
[00:38:00]  we got video screens all over the studio so uh that's playing in the background as we uh describe  it to everybody he's smiling he's having a ball oh yeah he's genuinely hungry well they don't call  him sergeant magoo for nothing the sergeant part makes uh makes it oh yeah he's one that uh he's a  survivor yeah you know he's out there in the uh in the desert separated from the rest of the troops  of course he's surviving and they tried to frag him well as we get close closer to the eggnog 
[00:38:30]  drinking challenge this year we'll have a lot of those video clips from last year including the one  we just described yeah uh next week on the opian anthony show something to look forward to huh  sorry pat drank mduffy's mduffy pat pat drank magoo's puke yeah oh yeah i don't remember that  because no one remembers any of the other stuff because the baby bird video what's up uh alan jersey  what's up hey what's up what's up boys hey hey i made the dumb video and i'm tackling like a jackass 
[00:39:00]  oh that's you oh it was alan from jersey okay yeah dude you're so stupid i know  but you came up with a great idea we're gonna have other people do the exact same thing it'll help  uh market the eggnog drinking challenge it's all about viral marketing man you were the uh you're  the innovator of this so uh and you did a horrible job so we're just gonna forget about you take your 
[00:39:30]  idea steal it and uh make glory out of it yeah oh i invented that all right alan thank you so much  thanks god all right uh other things going on today we got a man calling 9-1-1 for beer  we got a principal busted in women's clothing an area known for drugs and prostitution we got uh  j-lo finally announcing she's pregnant she's like six months pregnant and at the end of her  does anyone care about this j-lo thank you that's filed that that one's done we don't have to worry 
[00:40:00]  about that anymore but at the end of a concert uh she's pretty much like showing big time and she  finally announces it and then uh what else there was one real oh the carrot story of course yes the  driving instructor you want to do that after the break yeah we were going to do something after the  last break and we never got to it what was all the shack divorce thing we're all revved up well we  kind of we kind of did it though did we yeah what else can we say about it sucks it if you're a guy 
[00:40:30]  and you're going through a divorce it just sucks yeah and when you see like high profile cases like  shack and paul mccartney you realize the divorce laws have got to change it's ridiculous i'm looking  at the the court document shack's wife oh she wants access to all his you know his uh contracts with  the miami heat what she never she never played a second of nba basketball no she wants uh let's see 
[00:41:00]  she wants yeah his playing uh contracts oh if you're if if if you're thinking of getting married  these days just get a lawyer involved right from the beginning lawyers and uh love will go hand in  hand these days it's it's just uh it's just ridiculous you know i was looking at the paper  yesterday yes it said the history channel may have found bigfoot i know very excited very 
[00:41:30]  excited yeah you don't believe it didn't you see the footage no i did not did you see the footage  no i saw the old footage of the guy that fell off the horse yeah and the guy in the costume walking  yeah and he turns his head and they realized it was a fake because he had a miami dolphins hat on  that's the most ridiculous footage yeah but this isn't like uh mtv this is the history channel  aren't they supposed to be a little more highbrow with their stuff nah they used to be 
[00:42:00]  not anymore they're they're going into sensationalism there were a lot of these cable channels that  were kind of like uh they were just there for educational purposes no one really watched them  things like the history channel uh science channel um there there are a few other ones uh what what's  like myth busters on what was a and e i mean uh what discovery discovery sure uh a and e was another  one but then they realized uh hey if we put some stuff on here that uh people will like you know  maybe a little titillating in some way uh a lot of the war stuff is great people will watch and and 
[00:42:30]  they're right so now it's kind of a little more sensationalism and entertainment than it is really  learning so when they start doing bigfoot stories ah ah you don't believe in bigfoot  no well they think there's a missing link between people and apes i mean it's not crazy that they'll  find something i just don't know i don't know why they have there has to be a missing link  there's the you look at the chart it's whatever it's what it is well you know what it is because 
[00:43:00]  like you know one one moment in history now they can still see they just have they have ashtray  hands we just tracked them and killed them at will and then all of a sudden here we are  driving cars there's something that happened yeah we kind of like you know kind of adapted  took a while it wasn't like one week yeah one week there's a bunch of retarded hairy men walking  around eating mammoth meat and the next uh week they're shaking hands with a guy in a suit  have you ever walked a briefcase have you ever walked in the woods yeah it's a giant scary place 
[00:43:30]  yeah i know no i mean like really walk in the woods i mean like i was lost in the woods  no you you i was lost in the woods and there were bears you did drive by hiking i'm talking going to  like uh the pacific northwest and walk into a rainforest dude i was lost in the mountains  it was a it was a little hiking trail hiking trail gone gone wrong i it was 24 hours in freezing 
[00:44:00]  cold rain lost in the woods with no food no fire but the whole time you were like a mile away i thought i  could die you were a mile away from a road the whole time who knows where the road was i didn't  see any road well that's not going deep into the woods it took us days to walk out one day but it  you know it seemed like days and and a black bear crossed uh our trail yeah i had to sleep in a lean  two a lean two yeah that is pretty crazy for you sleeping in a lean two trying to make fire with 
[00:44:30]  rocks and a stick in the rain like an idiot no clue how to do it could have been there forever did you  really try to make a fire wouldn't you this is one of these stories that comes up from time to time  anthony was lost in the woods for about uh 24 hours me and uh my girlfriend went hiking yeah and uh we got  up the hill uh this this hill in the woods decided to uh have lunch turn around and come back and she 
[00:45:00]  goes oh i remember when i was a kid we used to come up here and we went down that way i go no but  we came up that way yeah but we go down this way i'm like i'll give it a try and within a half an hour  45 minutes i'm going uh-oh because we've it's like a video game level we dropped off some of these rocks  where i knew there was no getting back up them so you're committed now to the trail oh because  i'm gonna climb down because yeah at one point i would have just said look i don't care how long  it takes we're turning around going back and going back down the way we came but we had to climb down 
[00:45:30]  these rocks i'm rock climbing and and and walking and it started getting dark and you were pebble  climbing it would dude no this was this is like upstate new york woods everywhere but you said a hill  there's mountains upstate it was a mountain i mistook it for a hill i'm just trying to jam  when did you realize there was a problem uh about a real i realized there was a something was amiss 
[00:46:00]  uh 45 minutes into the hike back and then within an hour and a half i knew this could be big trouble  because i realized we didn't have anything when did she realize um point i tried to keep it like  you know everything's fine everything's cool until i just lost my mind at one point i'm like where the  are we oh not another hill up because you know we knew you had to go downhill everything is downhill 
[00:46:30]  when you've walked up a mountain it's all down so we walked down down down i'm like okay we're on the  right track going down and then you hit the bottom of the trail it curves and now you're going back up  but there's nowhere else to go i'm like we shouldn't be going back up again and and like i said rock  climbing that and then it started getting dark and that's when i knew there's a problem there is a big  problem because now you could break an ankle we had to stop so i saw a sign and it said it had a picture 
[00:47:00]  of a lean-to on it an arrow so there's no signs in the real woods dude it was just an archaic sign i i  was barely able to see it i'm glad lucky lucky we saw it or we'd be dead the caveman uh made this  sign back yes and the lean-to why would you be dead you would just spend the night in the woods  yeah because spent the night in the woods we were we were out of the weather in the lean-to  it was raining it was cold upstate rain see what the homeless people do in the city you can survive 
[00:47:30]  one night out in the wilderness they got food on them they got newspapers to shove in their clothes  weren't wearing warm clothes it was hot during the day and then at night it got a cold and and rainy  it got cold and rainy and and we had no water so as we're walking we had to drink the water that was  dripping off the trees why not you didn't have to drink water are you i was you can go 24 hours  without drinking water and then no no no no no and then after walking all that way in the cold rain 
[00:48:00]  yeah and then sleeping in the cold in the lean-to i woke up and my my legs and ankles refused to work  they were because they just tightened up from all the walking in the cold rain and then just stopping  and sleeping to sleep there was no sleep i was gazing off into the haze of the rain in the woods just  waiting for a monster to come out you scared oh was i scared i am a baby i was petrified at monsters in  the woods it was it was it was frightening i couldn't sleep i kept we we had one light jacket 
[00:48:30]  that was like over one of my shoulders and one of her shoulders and i'm peering out like over the  jacket looking into the mist of the woods just waiting to see  i didn't know what was out there monsters what's the lean-to it's like a um is it like a bathroom 
[00:49:00]  and a bed and a no the lean-to is uh what kind of monster you think was going to come out a bear i  thought a bear was going to come out at least it's uh like a real monster you weren't no they  were real monsters you weren't thinking werewolves or no i thought werewolf i thought um uh crazed  murderer i thought they could be crazed murderer why he couldn't see either but for some reason they  can why would a crazed murderer be out in the woods i know wouldn't he be killing someplace where there's  people i don't know but they always find like stupid people that are in the lean-to maybe the guy 
[00:49:30]  was staking out the lean-to that's in the movies don't matter sometimes it happens yeah he could have  built the lean-to for dummies yeah that got lost and then he can hacks them up it's a portable lean-to  sign and lean-to he probably just brings them around and murder people like wily coyote he unfolds it  puts it back in this pickup truck and goes to the next location yes it could have happened i was  looking waiting and every time you hear like a  in the woods that's bigfoot no it was it was crazed killer or a bear or some type of monster 
[00:50:00]  oh i didn't think bigfoot all the foot's too or just the forest ranger walking around making sure  everyone put their fires out no we were way far away from a ranger station yeah i guess you were  it was very frightening yeah and after that i went home and ordered my satellite phone  oh you did yes so if i'm ever in a situation again where i'm going to be going somewhere  uh that is out of cell phone range i always take my satellite phone you can get anywhere 
[00:50:30]  anywhere i was in the middle of the ocean on a uh on a cruise ship has a reception very good  yeah uh spectro from uh michigan writes a lean-to is where crybabies sleep  all right listen we can continue with this after the break we're late can we talk more about bigfoot  we come back absolutely this is what we're gonna do jimmy this is uh uh a radio tease for everybody  they think they found uh bigfoot or evidence of bigfoot and we'll tell you what the evidence  is after the break how's that all right and more of uh anthony getting lost in

[00:52:00]  lie and it's new show monster quest what's monster quest about that's when uh you and a friend  go on a quest together and um you take each other and um give each other pleasure under a porch  monster quest just as long as it's a quest linger longer you're questing for something that looks  like a thumb that's right kind of like picture a thumb with like a freshen up gun type of feeling  you know what's uh know what's dumb about this monster quest show the name sounds great monster 
[00:52:30]  quest then you think okay they're gonna do with the big they're gonna do their bigfoot show  and then they're gonna do the lockness lockness monster and then the yeti okay yeti that's even  falling off but that's kind of bigfoot yeah that's just snowy bigfoot snowy bigfoot and then  then they start getting into the crazy thing like the phoenix uh the uh giant tortoise the jersey 
[00:53:00]  devil yeah yeah one of those and then they're gonna run out ideas quickly uh well anyway you had a  group they went into the woods to see if bigfoot was living in ontario canada oh by the way hold on  man i gotta uh give uh greg from ohio some knowledge go ahead greg hey hope what's going on  bud hey man hey uh since when did the rainforest end up in the pacific northwest do you honestly  think there's only one rainforest yeah where is the rainforest well uh tropical climates maybe 
[00:53:30]  uh you might want to google the hoe rainforest when did when was the last time it snowed in the  rainforest look up the hoe rainforest outside of seattle washington my friend smarty pants  i hiked around in the hoe rainforest there you go h-o that's what i get for going to school in ohio 
[00:54:00]  all right it's in olympic national uh park it is truly a rainforest that's the rainforest with the  nappy canopy yes you guys rock man punch now all right good afternoon to cleveland by the way i'm uh  i'm sorry i said that i apologize for saying it's just very mossy and then you realize that your life  doesn't mean crap in the end it's one of those forests you walk around you see trees that are  growing out of other trees that fell down so the tree fell down uh a mere 400 years ago and now there's 
[00:54:30]  another tree that's growing in the middle of this tree that's at least two to 300 years old  and and you walk around going oh my god my life doesn't mean nothing it's gonna be over in a  blink of an eye you're a mayfly compared to those things that's why i hate walking around nature  went to the grand canyon boy this must have taken a lot of years to make it's too big it's too big i  know i'm doing too much for my mind to wrap around yeah i know i'm doing a brian reagan but yeah your 
[00:55:00]  mind starts going oh no yeah it's no one's ever gonna remember me that little river down there  right you look at it it's like oh that that made all this yeah that probably took some time  yeah then then you walk around a museum or something they have like a like a like a big  freaking cut out of a tree and then they start showing you the history oh the rings yeah yeah the  historical events jesus born right it's like oh really and it's not even near the middle of the 
[00:55:30]  tree oh jesus born is like close to the bark on the on the edge of the thing yeah this is when the  sun exploded oh my god you gotta go way back to the beginning of the life of a tree i can't handle  that stuff that is creepy anyway uh so they went to try to see if this monster this bigfoot was in  ontario and it had a bunch of scientists and they were videotaping and they had an audio crew at a  cabin in the utterly they write the utterly remote uh snell grove lake wherever that is uh pulling dna 
[00:56:00]  samples from the trap and exploring the uh the the forest so they had bear traps all over the place  right the show has caused a stir among enthusiasts because it has gotten so close to proving the  sasquatch monster may in fact exist the show uh made contact they're saying with the thing on its  last night of filming a stone was thrown at a stone was thrown at about 2 a.m yeah so i guess a stone 
[00:56:30]  was thrown at the cabin they were staying at uh the stone hit like a bullet it was thrown with amazing  accuracy so the crew threw a stone back into the woods and in a matter of minutes a second  stone was launched at them by a crew member who realized this whole thing was a bus and they had  to have something exactly that was a boom mic operator they're like where's fred he must be in  the bathroom but the monster is throwing rocks throwing rocks and the rocks stop and fred shows 
[00:57:00]  back up what i missed yeah exactly with a pocket full of rocks how great would it be they captured the  sasquatch and then just put a chain around his neck and throw him in the river and drown him  with with no scientific exploration just no evidence taking no nothing they just drown it  they drown it and just punch it and take it for being so elusive and they bury it in a shallow grave  jimmy you're wrong you've kept us you wrecked it for me why you think that that was what it was 
[00:57:30]  even though i'm a bit older now i still want to believe in bigfoot just like i did when i was a  12 year old kid watching these shows with leroy uh what's his name leroy uh oh my god leonard  nemoid leonard nemoid yeah leonard nemoid in search of he was right if it was leroy mr spock  would have installed differently right  wow i hope my spirit got that that was terrific jeez they don't have their camera 
[00:58:00]  sorry that's all right oh well uh this guy was scared i felt the adrenaline when we threw that  rock into the woods and then it got sent back my heart raced then they say blood tissue and hair  discovered later on a bear trap outside the cabin was tested the hair did not match any known north  american bear or animal and test showed an uncanny similarity to human dna with one exception the  irregular dna matched that of a primate wow that's frightening and they also found the the big 
[00:58:30]  thing though which they don't write here because they didn't have enough space was that they were uh  somebody wrote the yeti is a douche on the cabin and they think it was him because there's a rivalry  but he spelled douche wrong as a lot of times primates will do they spell it with nine o's  a little carried away yeah they just they love they love that sound douche  larry maryland what's up hey how you doing hey um got on google earth if you go around you see  like little dots everywhere like little yellow dots a little color dots and if you click on them 
[00:59:00]  it gives you information and i was clicking on some local where i live and they uh take you to a site  where all these people have reported different uh sasquatch or bigfoot sightings and they give you  their like real stories about what they found and everything if you get bored he tells the story  and it's like that if you get bored yeah you know it's something to do when you're sitting around  at work well the only problem is when these guys come out like ope's talking about the stuff leonard  nimoy used to do like that that guy admitted that would they so many of them admit hoaxes now 
[00:59:30]  like on their deathbeds like the guy um the surgeon's photo was the famous loch ness monster yeah  um and he admitted it was a hoax it wasn't it was a simple little stupid thing stupid deathbed  confessions i should have died in a fire yeah so we can enjoy it yeah we can enjoy it during our  lifetime and did bigfoot the guy say that was a hoax too like uh with the he was wearing a bigfoot  outfit i don't know what happened with the bigfoot robert johnson's name yes somebody came out and  said that that was a hoax really yeah really the guy that got thrown off his horse but kept the 
[01:00:00]  camera going and they show the rest of the footage like after the monster runs away when he when he  comes back in and then he gets in his car and drives away in the bigfoot outfit and there are still  people who believe well because he had a birthday party to go to yes you know there's the footage  look at that stupid bigfoot uh let's see i remember the analysis that went down like they said if you  look at the stride you'll notice it's a longer gate than of that of a human like those old shows used  to try to really sway your opinion of the whole thing and search up was the worst leonard nimoy 
[01:00:30]  extraterrestrials ufos psychic phenomena his voice used to scare the crap  out of me though yeah as a kid funny intro to that show yeah it's really good sure it's there  yeah it'll bring back memories for some people are you uh yes jimmy uh josh and philly what's up  yeah what's going on guys better jesh hey what's that game when you were lost in the woods were you  how could you be afraid i mean didn't you have your rapier with you i had not a weapon i didn't have 
[01:01:00]  my rapier but i and then i tried to pick up try to pick up a stick big stick when i saw the bear  so i could poke the bear's face if he tried to eat me and um i pick up a stick and it broke as i  picked it up it was one of those like the rotting limbs yeah because it was just there it's been  raining and it's been rotting in the woods for over a hundred years yeah and you finally picked  it up i fell apart in front of your eyes fell apart i i had nothing i'm just staring at a bear  just going if this thing turns around and sees me and attacks me there's nothing i could do about it 
[01:01:30]  nothing hey also i say uh forgiveness for dog when he falls in a bucket of aids  i love my linger longers out there  this experience i ever had was being lost in the woods it was i was eight years old with the girl  scouts they're gonna take us camping and then you circle and you circle and we're leaving 
[01:02:00]  like little marks on rocks and then you hit the same rock where'd you go carol heckscher park  out there on long island to get lost in heckscher park blue bay out on long island you're right  of course i know where she gets lost wait where'd she get lost blue bay blue bay  blue blue eight years old okay you're a kid you think there'd be some supervision but no it is  scary because you turn around everything looks the same you don't know where you are  oh my god you've dredged up some memories yeah you know what there's not much that scares me in my 
[01:02:30]  life there are two things though anthony brought this up recently on the show one is uh i have done  some hiking uh in my day and when you're like on a hiking trail and you look into the woods and you  know that the woods just go on for miles and even though it's like a bright sunny day up above it is  already dark at one in the afternoon that that creeps me the f out i can't handle that yeah and i want to  be one with nature man and the other thing is if you've ever done any hold on carol if you've ever 
[01:03:00]  done any scuba diving or snorkeling like anthony brought up and you kind of you look down into the  kind of oh you look to the let's call it the abyss whatever you just look and you realize like  that you know land is is spain basically that's the next there's nothing but water and monsters  between you and spain and it gets dark really quickly and you have no clue what's going to come out of  that darkness that that freaks me the f out it's frightening even when i like recently i went on 
[01:03:30]  vacation and i turks and caicos and i was doing some snorkeling off the beach no big deal right  just having some fun and even just turning and looking outwards scared the crap out of me even  though i knew i was only what yeah 40 50 feet from shore yep that just that darkness huh i would  never go snorkeling because you can't breathe down there okay darkness get a hold of yourself  carol i love carol love a god you're panicking  we love carol we want more women calling this dumb show uh jesse what's up 
[01:04:00]  hey what's up boys i was wondering uh and when you were lost in the woods was one of the monsters  you were afraid of a mexican in the bushes  guys mark in boston what's up  hey guys what's up hey listening on bcn of course comics come home this weekend jimmy's gonna be a part of  that there you go and i also say go pets go what do you say to that go pets go all right mark what's  up yeah yesterday when you guys were talking about um toucher and rich yeah on them alcohol  all that yeah yeah they're not doing any drinking at any events anymore because of that 
[01:04:30]  why they should drink more at events that's great wait we need a toucher and rich uh update we're  fascinated by these guys they're the kings of afternoons on bcn and all of boston and uh we uh did a  little uh event with them a couple weeks ago the halloween party and man was toucher hammered  gone he had like a belushi thing going on so what they're not allowed to drink anymore  no they're just not drinking because um management saying that bcn's um like they're 
[01:05:00]  not alcoholics and that they want to keep their uh reputation of not drinking why what's with this  reputation crap exactly this is radio let toucher and rich drink yeah their livers fall out just  looking at him i could see he was like mickey rork and barfly just sitting across from him he was  unshaven he had only slippers in the afternoon why would you want to change that they do a good show  don't mess with the chemistry yeah stop uh the chemistry literally the alcohol mixing with the 
[01:05:30]  blood yeah they're trying to make this into like a legitimate business this is radio leave him alone  radio guys are just let toucher drink if toucher wants to drink he should be allowed to drink  leave him alone douche all right mark thanks for the toucher and rich update today  thanks have a good one guys say hi to adam 12 too for us okay we'll do that all right uh let's say 
[01:06:00]  uh hi to paul in new york paul what's up linger longer he just he just wanted to say that that's  all said on the line and i just want to hit him uh dave in kansas city how are you buddy good morning  guys good morning didn't bob kelly claim that he saw a werewolf when he was in iraq yeah he did  uh yeah that whole world that werewolf story yeah he never finished the whole story i think  somebody cut him off or something but he started to tell it when you guys were on the other side 
[01:06:30]  one morning i don't i don't have heard i think he tried every time he tries to tell it i can't get  through it he uh he is convinced i remember this uh when he went over to iraq to to perform for the  troops and they were like kind of wandering around one of the compounds or something like that  and he swears he saw a werewolf yeah right on uh maybe we could get him on the line to retell that  story today all right i just can't hear bob thinking he saw where i just can't do it every  time he's tried to dude and i'm over there and the tents are going and i see this i know just shut 
[01:07:00]  up you didn't see a werewolf that was a that was a woman who lived there get on your hands and knees  like a dog that's it crawl around like a dog that's right bob would say to a werewolf of course he would  and then we i think i heard him telling that story once and we were saying like the zoos had let  animals out and there were creatures out there that you don't even know about in the deserts of  the middle east yeah and he's he's an authority i saw a werewolf no you didn't you saw a big dog 
[01:07:30]  yeah it's just dummy it's something you didn't see walking around the streets of new york city  so he's fascinated by it he's probably in a sugar coma because they have all that candy there the  soldiers eat so he probably was just shoving like you know hershey's kisses into his fat face  before in the morning getting onto a blackhawk they probably had to fly him and colin on  separate blackhawks weight restrictions we can only lift one tank at a time  is tom alive friday  kind of stuck with this bit from white plains it's tom what's up tom

[01:16:30]  comedy store i was just like i was going to kill myself just going through that divorce yeah and  just was not not leaving any detail out oh yeah talking about suicide it was great he's a great  comic man he's going through some crap man oh boy i saw him i hope he goes on second i don't want to  follow him i saw him at comics here in new york and comics is spelled with an x and he went on a  whole rant because uh the crowd wasn't at where it should have been for a comedian like mark maron 
[01:17:00]  completely honest that place should have been just sold out right and he was so frustrated because  he's going through the divorce his life sucks and he's on stage and he can see he's just seething  but still giving just a great performance and then he turns and sees comics spelled with an x and just  goes yeah comics with an x that's great you go on a radio show for three or four hours promoting  uh the website comics.com and it's spelled with an x no wonder no one's here he's just losing his  mind like why couldn't you just spell comics like everyone else spells comics now you have to be 
[01:17:30]  clever with an x wow he was great though i love the guy i saw uh the amazing bill burr yeah down at  governor's uh the other night right behind the bally's yes right behind the bally and uh i it was  so goddamn funny bill oh just non-stop from the beginning to the end laugh your ass off a lot of  new stuff just really funny dude the crowd was how you get how you bash the yankees in new york like 
[01:18:00]  that and just you know what and get away with and and and pump the socks and make sarcastic remarks  but then people just he doesn't lose the audience at all it's great it's great and and that that that  bitch that perked up and said something you buried just buried her in in like three sentences she was  done really good you know what's funny funny about that whole set was i ate a big italian meal 
[01:18:30]  before i got on stage and then i took an airborne trying to make sure i didn't get sick and then  something a risk for a mile because my throat was messed up and i don't know what it did but a half  hour into my set i didn't think i was gonna make it you were sweating yeah and i couldn't tell it was  my sweater of because the fact that i was trying to hold it in dude i'm telling you oh and i had i had  three waves of it oh when i was sitting there like am i gonna have to get off stage am i really gonna  have to get off stage and how do you do that i gotta go uh people i gotta dude if you weren't 
[01:19:00]  there i might ask the host to come back it was that bad and then finally uh i don't know i pushed  through the last and i was able to get through it and uh ran off stage put it that way oh wow hey  speaking of uh making fun of the yankees dennis leary did just that at the beacon theater last night  and just got huge huge reaction but booze i would suppose no it's hilarious after yankees and then  he's like how do you let joe torrey go to la the guy sat and gave you four world series he sat so 
[01:19:30]  long he got ass cancer for you guys and you allow him to leave new york that's pretty good oh he was  killing with his red sox stuff he came out like red sox won the world series he's like f you just went  right after the crowd it's hilarious these people respect the honesty right yeah i mean we're being  hurt in boston and we make no secret that we like the new york teams you know it's just cute though  people think it's cute like that red sox won a couple that's nice yeah that's the way it is 
[01:20:00]  for new yorkers like oh that's sweet okay good i thought they were the posts of being the biggest  babies about that whole patriots scandal like they have a little asterisk yeah where it says  patriots cheated yeah yeah like like every week it's like it's just we uh grow up already  they're all cheating thank you we support the whole patriots thing on this show we're like  are you kidding me they i blame uh mangini there for blowing everyone's uh you know cover they were  all doing it and mangini was a sore loser well i i got some doing something like the colts they got 
[01:20:30]  they they got accused of they were pumping in crowd noise right we went over that the other day  yeah it was cbs though it was cbs the cd skipped in the truck the nets got caught doing that years  ago what do you mean because they they have like nine people in the crowd and i was with somebody  and he goes dude i'm telling you there's not that many people here because you'd be there  and the nets would do something great and you just hear wow and you're looking around and there's  sort of like 40 people sort of lazily clapping and you feel like you're in like a sold-out coliseum 
[01:21:00]  make it sound more exciting yeah make it more sellable yeah let's go to boston people seem like  they like this i better go uh john what's up true hey uh yeah you guys are talking about man  town and uh it just reminds me of like the roman empire and now everyone used to just get all naked  and just jump on top of each other yeah well man the roman empire definition the war helmets they  men i don't understand why you would want to just like brag that you just want to hang out with men 
[01:21:30]  i don't get that there's really no uh there's no upside so it's so cliche guy thing it's it's it's  phony it's uh obviously you're not too happy about your situation if you guys you you want to get away  from your wife but you're not going to go with like three other 40 year olds and build a fort  well that's pretty much what you did yeah you just built a better fort than you could when you were a  kid i understand going to the sports bar for a couple hours but when you actually dedicate 
[01:22:00]  a part of your house where she's not allowed so the men can come over and be men stay out  that's always like there's no tampons down here won't need any that's ready up top come on high  five right guys i i really like sports until i go to a sports bar and i realize the demographic that  i'm in yeah these fat losers playing fantasy football oh hey did you see that one yeah he's on my  fantasy team so really what else is part of your fantasy what's wrong with fantasy football did you  actually get laid once once or twice a year i uh i'm with bill on this one don't get the fantasy 
[01:22:30]  football thing it is one of the gayest things ever and you go over with all your friends and you sit  there and you have a draft they get all excited yeah i don't get it you don't get it just don't get  there are a lot of things that you know people don't get uh video games i love some people uh uh get on  me about some of my video game choices fine fantasy football something i don't get you know  what i don't get bruce springsteen don't get him don't get it 
[01:23:00]  born to run boring song stinks all of his songs never gave me the chills you're not i never was  like oh you're not a fan of bruce juice that's great bruce juice 59 minute stories in between  every song yeah oh anthony used to do that yeah we'd have to talk like the everyman you know  and we were down in jersey and that's when you know you know we were growing up and and young 
[01:23:30]  in jersey when people were trying to make a difference and well if i mean and me and rosie  we're gonna be big stars and oh wow wow wow what there's always a factory in the sky of course  right yeah well he works hard all day at the factory then we'd go to the boardwalk in asbury park  wendy and there's no responsibility put on the person who smoked weed instead of studying in high 
[01:24:00]  school and that's how you ended at the factory somehow it's the boss's fault yeah the boss man  don't understand really he doesn't want to acknowledge that as soon as he got enough money  he made sure he found a really nice part of jersey to live in of course that f the mills in the  factories and stupid wendy done i'm done with wendy done with the crappy part yet  you know you could book giant stadium from here until 2011 he'd sell out every single night 
[01:24:30]  with his stories uh oh uh uh just to complete this we were talking about this earlier and we found it  here it is this series presents information based in part on theory and conjecture the producer's  purpose is to suggest some possible explanation but not necessarily the only ones to the mysteries we  have an example that was a disclaimer totally we have no idea what we're talking about a complete  disclaimer this is pure fantasy we made this crap up we're gonna take a shot that's what we're gonna do 
[01:25:00]  and uh our shot might miss and probably will settle in for an hour that was in search of but it didn't  do that that whole line you did no because i do remember leonard nimoy doing the opening where he  talked about will investigate psychic phenomenon phenomenon they never got ufos huh you got  nothing accomplished on the search no never you you left that show the same as when you went in  what are there or aren't there well first of all the cameras were as big as buick so it's hard to 
[01:25:30]  like haul that into the woods to try to get a picture of bigfoot right perhaps plus what a great  gig for leonard nimoy like he didn't have to search for anything he would just go down to do the  voiceover yeah oh yeah drive down from his spock oh of course playing mr spock and then he'd go  into a studio record some stuff not even look at what he's uh doing voiceover for what are we  looking at this week platypuses all right all right give me the copy the duck-billed platypus  god's mystery or alien is that good good take okay go on to the next one what are we doing 
[01:26:00]  what what we point out what we point out bill it was like in search of bigfoot in search of  locked his monster in search of yeti which was when you call it the uh this snowy bigfoot and  then after that it's like uh this week in big drop off in search of the dodo bird is it really  extinct in search of lost civilizations that was another one that was another one you know they'd  go to mayans and aztecs and and then they'd do the alien tie-in look at the uh etchings on this  pyramid this could be an ancient astronaut yeah or a guy holding a pot yeah it's pretty much no that 
[01:26:30]  could be the steering wheel oh is that it oh the in search of the abominable snowman what a turd  i gotta admit when i was a kid i liked the show granted i was like yeah i know every kid liked it  to believe right and then you would get scared at night even though you lived in a suburb scared  and you lived on a cul-de-sac and you were worried about bigfoot and all these creatures coming up to 
[01:27:00]  your window the footage is over the camera's always shaking they never quite get it that's like there's a  thing on youtube is some guy allegedly getting eaten by lions oh yeah and the funny thing the  lion just comes up and just sort of pushes them down and my favorite part is when the person holding  the camera goes for the reaction shots of the kids in the car like anybody would move that camera  someone's getting eaten by a lion i'd be so like you know frozen in that moment i would be like let's  try to get a couple of a couple of you know in case i want to go to commercial a couple of cutaways 
[01:27:30]  i'll pan over to the five-year-old crying action shots yeah he's producing them yeah just because  you gotta edit something out we got something to fill  in search see this proves my point now we're looking for youtube uh in search of uh we found  in search of the elephant man oh but he was a real guy with bumps who's the elephant man it's a real  disease yeah the elephant man was uh the guy what guy the guy from the movie  john merrick yeah that's it john merrick well they're just he was real you don't got to go in 
[01:28:00]  search of him but that's not he's dead that's just a guy with a lot of weird bumps on his body  why the elephant man yeah he had the mumps yeah that's all so that's in search of hey let's go to  mike in boston listening on bcn of the mumps mikey what's up what's going on guys hey hey jimmy big  fan then thank you yeah listen the premise behind behind mantown uh i have this job uh lasted a week 
[01:28:30]  where i had to sit in an office and listen to uh mantown uh the premise is that all men are in  mantown until you do something stupid and uh the guys there they deem you not worthy of mantown and you  get kicked right out how do you get kicked out of mantown liking girls by admitting yeah you like  girls i like girls i like girls well then you're out of man this is the stupidest radio thing ever  and we've heard some doozies all the years bad bad bits their whole show is uh is revolves around 
[01:29:00]  this dumb mantown idea so how do you get kicked out uh mike did they give any examples oh well the  one i remember the most was uh half off they used to you know he was pretty much a king of mantown  because you know he was on baywatch with all these girls and you know well what kind of you know  job is that and who's lucky enough to do that and then after that video of him comes out of him  drunk on the floor you know with a with a ham sandwich or whatever it was and his daughter taping 
[01:29:30]  him that's what got him kicked out of mantown that should have got him elected the head of mantown  drunken slob whose own kid is just so awful she's filming him embarrassing him that's what makes  you a great man you know it's funny they also had when i was uh at this job for a week listening to  this nonsense i uh but there was somebody who was calling up consistently yelling fracas oh really  and they had no fracas and uh about a day later they said it's just something from uh oh and a 
[01:30:00]  there you go well the norton fans are tearing up mantown oh good i hope they continue tearing it up  with uh norton references thank you sir let's go to philly say hi to mike mike what's up hey guys what's  going on hey hey hey you're forgetting about spontaneous human combustion oh that was my favorite  in search of spontaneous human combustion i'd go to bed at night scared to death i was i was 
[01:30:30]  going to explode wasn't that like a scary thing because it could just happen you'd just be laying  there and and you catch on fire spontaneously you just catch on fire remember they would show the  couch and stuff and it would be burned uh beyond recognition but the rest of the house wouldn't be  touched because yeah because the fire burned in such a way it's burns really hot because of the fat in  your body and oh man that was one of my favorite you're bringing a great memory up there mike wait  was that was that nonsense it never happened i don't know what they there's all kinds of rumor and and 
[01:31:00]  and speculation they can't be but how do you just burst into flames because if your body temperature goes  up like five six degrees i mean you're gonna die after a while right when it gets up to about 100 405 you  do yeah but you don't you don't you don't get hot enough to burst into flames it's a chemical reaction  like the the certain chemicals in your body mix that aren't supposed to mix like you have potassium  in there and uh water if you mix potassium and water together you're gonna get like a huge hot flame 
[01:31:30]  will you yeah but if i have a banana and then drink of fiji water well there are other things in it  that prevent the molecules from reacting with each other flames keep it from reacting with each other  but if if they're alone and they can react with each other then you're gonna burst into flames but you  know there there there are precautions in there that keep that from happening but i don't know  one other one too yeah you burst into flames you go on a cruise i think about it i don't go i've  never been on a boat because of the bermuda triangle oh yeah oh that was a huge one because that tied in 
[01:32:00]  ufos and missing uh people underwater civilization yes everything atlantis atlantis and is atlantis the  bermuda triangle and they had the divers and you see like uh like a path yeah oh water could this have  been an ancient highway right where the atlanteans used to uh travel but no it's not  it's coral it's coral fish all right it's nothing it sucks when you got a badge in search of like the 
[01:32:30]  great ones are ufos and bigfoot when they put like a search of the shadow people you're like  yeah no i don't even care about these things i've never heard of them before they don't exist i'm nine  i know that haunted houses was scary though i was a kid in search of haunted houses yeah and then  they'd show like ghosts and stuff let's go to kevin in pennsylvania kevin yeah i think the uh  spontaneous combustion thing they said that was probably due to somebody falling asleep with a  cigarette on their chest oh yeah yeah then this busters did that or somebody was trying to do 
[01:33:00]  that again kind of brings back uh the memory of uh a little family vacation uh yes love that story  my uh my sister inherited some money from like some like distant uncle and my dad uh turned it  into the family vacation instead of going to disney we went way up into the mountains of new york where  this guy used to live and he uh he had a bunch of uh cottages that he rented out and my dad made it  sound like we were like gonna rock and roll and we would have the run of the place and we show up 
[01:33:30]  because i guess my sister this guy died and my sister had to go up there to sign some paperwork and get  some money whatever so we decided that we're going to stay on this guy's property we get there  and the grass was uh easily two to three feet high the pool wasn't used for at least a decade  the cottages no one has slept in them for for many many years and my dad still was trying to sell like  how cool is this you guys all get your own cottage and the algae right and the cottages were right up  against the woods that was obviously scary with monsters and all that because we were like 10 or 11 
[01:34:00]  and there were huge mosquitoes in each cottage and you could smell the sheets and the pillows and  stuff they haven't been washed in years that musky you know smell but my dad nothing fazed him so he  he said yeah you guys will all get your own cottage and then because i was the oldest even though i was  11 he decided i was old enough to see uh how this guy died so i go into the main house and we go into  the bedroom and there's plywood everywhere this is horrible i'll never forget this my dad horrified me 
[01:34:30]  this plywood everywhere where walls used to be and the ceiling used to be and uh the only hint that  this was a bedroom was uh where the mattress used to be the rug was still intact for the most part  the guy fell asleep in his bed with a freaking cigarette and burned himself alive oh my god  we're up here taking care of business and it was supposed to be this big great happy family vacation 
[01:35:00]  they did to a point where they had the plywood up where the walls used to be  but we had to go through the house and police tape still laying on the floor yeah we had to go  through his crap but my dad that the key to the story he sold it like this was going to be our  great summer vacation in the mountains crystal lake yeah camp crystal lake and you saw like the  burn marks where oh boy did i he had been dead oh it was uh it was a fine fire and then i had to come  back out and report it to my brothers and sister what i saw on there the horrific sight i saw and 
[01:35:30]  then we were scared s-less let him go out and tell the story to the others yeah and then my mom finally  stepped up and said we're not staying here and we've you know we got like a bed and breakfast or  something down the road oh you didn't stay f no we were scared out of our freaking minds you want  to talk about monsters that guy must have passed out drunk oh yeah the second your chest started  catching on fire wouldn't you wake up yeah just sort of you know pat it might have been the uh the what  is it called the gangrene or whatever his leg was rotting for some reason oh i don't know what that 
[01:36:00]  was about so maybe he started burning and he couldn't get out of his own bed that must have smelled good  burning gangrene but the whole lead up it was like it was like chevy chase and in vacation like  my dad was selling this as this great you know you're picturing your own campsite your own cottage  a pool the mountains well what's he gonna say it was horrific kids you'll gather together i want  to tell you why we're going up on this mission i felt like we were walking through a haunted house 
[01:36:30]  a haunted house you're disappointed when you saw the cottages oh well like you wouldn't believe  was the family oh yeah sucks oh yeah no one was psyched no one maybe one of my brothers could call  no one and add to the story dad fill the energy in the car just oh yeah drop it oh yeah yeah because  we were poor so my dad uh you know saw this as an opportunity to give us a great vacation it sucked  walking through that house that you're seeing dead guy stuff everywhere this vacation's gonna be great  is that where he died god that must have sucked for him though huh that must have sucked for him 
[01:37:00]  when he went there and he had to amp up something and he just so clearly knew sucked yeah it was it was  it was awful i think we were supposed to spend like a whole week there and we we did like a day  and then drove the 12 hours back home oh wow it was it was one of the most horrific things growing up  we have great vacation so we gotta take a break uh i don't know why that came up but it did 
[01:37:30]  hey uh carrot joke we gotta talk about the uh driving instructor after the break we this is  the story of the day this guy's great we'll get into that next and of course uh the principal  busted in women's clothing unbelievable and then we got the man calling 9-1-1 for beer we still got  lots of show to do with bill burr who's gonna be where again uh vegas comedy festival next weekend  saturday night uh 17th very good and jimmy's uh doing caroline's and i i don't think we have to  promote that i think it's gonna be like uh full house jimmy well let's just hope it's a sensation

[01:39:30]  got like a big big branch let it go and then you put and he kind of gets don't wear loose clothing  you think he just forgot to let go you know what happened he didn't button his flannel that's what  happened shirt tail was hanging out those things he gets caught on it has to be the red and black one  and you have to have that hat with the built-in earmuffs on it well this is the beauty police called the  residential area at the 4 p.m found the landscape worker's body inside the wood chipper it isn't clear  if the victim was a man or a woman wow whoa i bet you he was doing some flying kicks into the 
[01:40:00]  branches to push them into the wood chipper oh he went in groin first so they can't identify it  i don't know it all looks like hamburger meat wow yeah brings you back to fargo doesn't it yeah  the wood chipper scene in fargo is is shoving the foot that bothers you it makes me laugh so freaking  hard to see the blood mist flying out on the on the nice snow and and you see the leg sticking out  he's trying to get the leg in the damn thing but do you know how far you have to go to a wood chipper 
[01:40:30]  for them not to be able to identify your face or genitals oh you're done it probably it probably  pulled his whole body in and out just spit it out yeah one minute you're a person the next minute  you're just liquid and and some meat i would think your head would be enough to block it up  no you don't see those things i probably really gotta work are you still are you still alive on  some molecular level as as like there's just like molecule the mist yeah when do you still 
[01:41:00]  live for a second it's a little spiritual up i don't know if the electric charges that make up  your thoughts and memories kind of go out there and when do you when do you think when do you think  you stop feeling it when do you think you start you probably start feeling it like mid-calf that's  like how quick the first right you're like ah and then by the time it gets to like your thigh you're  just gone yeah oh i think up to the waist because you're looking you just you're unless you went head  first it's probably better head first how do you think he was diving head first then say i like your 
[01:41:30]  idea he's trying to kick kick it in and it just sucked him in by the leg and he got it maybe by one leg  and then he does a split and his other leg bends up and cracks so he can get sucked in the rest of  the way you know i actually remember a long time ago i was clearing land one of the worst jobs i've  ever had in my life and i'm that was my big just terrifying when that thing would turn on and like  you basically you're supposed to come up and i made sure i wouldn't have that many branches because 
[01:42:00]  yeah and you're supposed literally as you throw it then you're supposed to kind of peel off  yeah i mean almost like a fighter pilot just sort of peel off in a bomb yeah because that thing will  come hit you in the head he probably went in head first i bet the branches came in whacked him in the  back of his head cut the front part of his beard if there's any god he went in head first is there  a way they can fix it where that doesn't happen there's probably safeties but yeah you would think  they would have machines i don't know hey uh you want to do the carrot this guy rules this guy rules 
[01:42:30]  we got to be careful we're allowed to read the story and then we got to be careful from there  carrot joke sex attacker guilty a driving instructor who who hit a carrot in his trousers  and pretended it was his can we say that oh okay and pretended it was his erect penis has been  convicted of four sex attacks on his pupils wow uh steven cooney 51 grow three woman learner three  learner drivers in a series of attacks uh back in 2002 a jury found him guilty of two uh indecent 
[01:43:00]  assaults and two sexual assaults he told the court the carrot incident was a practical joke of course  it was stop the court heard how cooney put the 12 inch carrot down his trouser this guy really went  broke didn't he he didn't get one of those little yummy like shaved carrots no a little for the 12 inch  carrot organic food one the big yeah he left the green stuff on it he put the 12 inch carrot down 
[01:43:30]  his trousers and told a pupil in her 40s that a perfectly executed maneuver was so good that it had  given him an erection you know what if he hadn't groped other people that's actually really funny  kind of a funny gag like hey look at what your three-point turn did that's great he's probably the  most boring guy ever and then he just he he bought a book on comedy be wacky be spontaneous one day he  figures he's just gonna go for broke make people laugh that was boring job they've already done the 
[01:44:00]  lampshade thing that's hack let me see what i can do with a carrot why would you go with a cucumber  yeah carrot kind of you know goes to off to a point there yeah i'll tell you why because he  always wanted to say to a girl go ahead go ahead do it it's good for your eyesight oh i don't know  i don't like vitamins he then took her hand and made her touch the vegetable before showing her the  carrot ah see that's the problem unprofessional and stupid you want that girl's a whore well he denied 
[01:44:30]  he denied placing her hand on his groin but he admitted hiding the vegetable in his pocket he admitted  to the jury that it was unprofessional and i said it was a practical joke just stupid but there was  another pupil who he offered to waive the uh 80 pound this is in england oh yeah see uh if he if  she just pulled over and uh had sex with him and she said i said uh no thank you she politely declined  how how awkward was the rest of that driving oh by the way could you uh pleasure me uh you know 
[01:45:00]  what no no no okay uh make a right up here 10 o'clock two o'clock whore i love her quote though  i just said no thank you steve and he regularly i know i didn't mean you he regularly groped her  during lessons between august 2005 and february hang on let me check wow wait september october  november december january that's six months of groping while she was driving how bad of a learner is  god almighty just park between the cones you prostitute 
[01:45:30]  plus he was able to get her hand onto the carrot yeah exactly she didn't fight it  yeah i'm blaming the victim on this one for six months come on when police arrested him they also  found naked photos in the glove box so there you go wow the carrot story is terrific today couldn't  hide anything that's wonderful hey we got andrew um uh wisconsin andrew what's up hey guys uh i live  here in southeastern wisconsin we had a guy that uh was trying to push push the uh branches through 
[01:46:00]  wood chipper got his foot caught and uh took about eight seconds for him to get stuck through he was  he was hanging on to the outside and screaming and and it took him about eight seconds there was  nothing left but bone chips and blood but he was hanging on screaming what his feet were in there  yeah and there were people across the yard and he was hanging on to the little  gauge you know that's supposed to prevent you from being stupid and putting your foot in there  yeah and it uh sucked him all the way through so hanging on until like your body just comes up  you lost too much blood your energy is you're just like i can't all right god yeah and they 
[01:46:30]  couldn't even show it on the news because the whole uh the whole yard was just red so what about  what about the big red button you could press that shuts the machine off yeah he was he was  actually pushing it and and they were having trouble with it or something so they disabled it  oh okay there you go real smart disable it wonderful bad luck how many people a year get  sucked through these things it's 30 once in like the last 10 years i think it's probably more than 
[01:47:00]  sharks yeah more than sharks sure three a year yeah it's not it's not common that's like oh my god  this machine is eating me yeah i'm being eaten by a machine it's like a robot is destroying me  the terminator and you never think when you're on your way to work i will be looking out of this wood  chip yelling at some guy and he won't he won't know what's going on he'll actually wave at me  from his yard or i get sucked in it reminds me of jaws when that guy was sliding down the boat 
[01:47:30]  oh yeah quinn of course yeah getting eaten let's go to nicole in pennsylvania nicole what's up  hi how are you good good i wanted to talk to you gentlemen about spontaneous human combustion  oh all right psychic phenomenal college and everyone has an internal thermometer inside their  bodies and in order to keep that going the mitochondria inside of you bump into each other  and cause friction now sometimes the mitochondria acts up a little bit and that would cause a fever 
[01:48:00]  and or spontaneous human combustion you know a fever and combustion that's uh quite the  quite the gap in temperature there well that's why it's spontaneous i suppose all right give me  the uh the news story on the the last guy that this happened to yeah let's do a little google search  today i i uh there is a book your your call is spontaneous human boredom there's an actual book 
[01:48:30]  on this though well there is it's a book on i guess there was only like 13 people ever known to  have this happen to them but it still they still don't can't explain it it never happened yeah all  right and and what's the name of the book uh nicole it's called good for you you know like  it's happened 13 times they can't explain it yet she can't  she calls up with stupid knowledge 
[01:49:00]  swinging this stupid knowledge stupid knowledge got away that hey uh football picks and you did  last week you want to do you do it again for us yeah here's how i uh do my football picks a lot of  people study them and let me get the big plug in football picks sponsored by dish network time to  get more tv from your tv sign up for dish network today uh a lot of people study the teams they you  know handicap them they teach the statistics players blah blah blah blah blah uh i've come up with a kind 
[01:49:30]  of a different way but very controversial it seems a lot of people call up and don't agree with the way  i pick these but uh here's the way i pick i take the name of the teams and i decide which thing that  they're named after can defeat the other thing they're named after and whoever can do it wins  that's how i do it so you pick the colts but a lot of people no we picked uh we'll pick the pats 
[01:50:00]  yeah patriots they got guns they can absolutely you're talking just straight up i didn't know  weapons were allowed well see this is where the controversy right away see the talking last week's  game and there's already controversy patriots i i they they rode horses you know they they kind of  were able to break them and yeah they really come on but what about when the colt gets on its hind legs  and just hits you with its hooves very rare knocks i think patriot hat right off your head i think more  patriots killed more horses uh than horses killed patriots probably raped them and and horses won twice 
[01:50:30]  they won in horse gag and that video from seattle yeah that's pretty much it yeah the horses are down  eight million four hundred and eight thousand to two so if it's like you know the colorado prissies  against the uh oklahoma uh phillies let's say something like that i would give it to the team  named after the horse all right thank you don't look at me like no no no i'm not because it was it was  we kind of tag teamed that one yeah we both fell into a ditch hold on you got the well you got the 
[01:51:00]  you got the cowboys and the giants cowboys and the giants now you you come on the cowboys are going  around they got ropes and six shooters but a giant you just got to step on them it's a giant  cowboys ain't beating a giant you need to fight them with like planes how did they come up with new  york giants anyways i don't know because the city's so big i guess the city of new jersey so you're  saying the ego of a new yorker is bigger than the ego no i take it quite literally it's not really the 
[01:51:30]  state it's not the city that they're from it's just what it is it's a cowboy against a giant are  you going giants yeah i would say giants what about the cowboys with the genocide that doesn't count for  anything if if indians were giants we'd all be screwed think gulliver's travel the what a bunch of  them i'm just saying you get a bunch of giants and a bunch of cowboys i'm tired done the cowboys are 
[01:52:00]  done they're getting stepped on so that's what i'm saying giants probably in the nra they got all  these psycho guns they don't have six shooters the giant goes it's nothing they got those guns with  the shotgun a gatling gun yeah the gatling with the shotgun shells bill just go with it this was  supposed to take five minutes oh giant so i'm picking the giants couple comments and then we'll  move on uh same thing i just gotta note bill we have seven games to pick yeah bill all right enough 
[01:52:30]  with the giants cowboys bill quite frankly we don't give a we don't give a crap we're just getting a  nice plug-in for dish network we're fine advertisers of this i've been too funny up to this point i saw a  little hole maybe i can get a couple of t he's in there t he all right how about the jaguars and  the titans now titans are big same thing you're looking at the same thing jaguars uh sharp teeth  sharp claws and stuff but it's a titan pick them up jaguars are cars no they're jaguars they're they're 
[01:53:00]  animals vicious cats yeah they're almost extinct a titan yeah your theory stink a titan can pick  him up by the tail whip him around throw him all right titan he's huge titans over the titans over  the jaguars yeah but a giant can't beat a cowboy no titans over the cowboy giant terrible they're huge  monstrous creatures what is a titan and a giant i wouldn't know what i'd pick if those two were  playing holy jesus yeah then you would have to really figure that out uh broncos and the chiefs  broncos and the chiefs two dates in one night on a wacky sitcom 
[01:53:30]  broncos and the chiefs i gave this one a little bit of thought and uh you gotta go with the  engines they were always breaking the broncos they they they dominated horses they rode a bareback  dominated horses so the chiefs over the broncos wow going for all the home teams what i i i'm not  i don't even i'm not looking all right redskins over the eagles redskins over the eagles first of  all this game won't happen the indians have too much respect for the uh birds of the birds of 
[01:54:00]  prey here in this country so this game will be canceled of prey this game will be canceled  flying high the ravens uh and uh the bangles wait what'd you say no no they will not play  the indians have too much respect for the bird football pool you dick oh i gotta pick something  yes okay i will say then that the redskins would uh dominate over the eagles if they wanted to  maybe they'll just capture them and pet them and then let them go again they use them as an ally 
[01:54:30]  no they if they'll kill them and they'll use every part of the eagle right every part of it  they don't waste out of its tendons of course redskins over the eagles all right bengals and the  ravens come on stop bengals the big tiger yeah the raven signals the devil damien but look does it  say devil signaling raven the baltimore devil signaling ravens mine are realistic i'm with bill  on this one yours are just silly and take your money out pure fantasy take your money out and 
[01:55:00]  how's the bengal uh gonna like uh like fight in the air uh he doesn't have to he's very stealthy  waits for the raven to land and then pounces why would the raven ever land raven lands it's not  gonna like the tiger's gonna sit the raven is a bird coat and the bird's gonna come and drop one  right on his head no i say the bengal 17 to 10 come to spread i'm saying bengals over ravens all  right how about the vikings and the packers dude you gotta give it to the vikings a bunch of meat 
[01:55:30]  packers get attacked by vikings who's winning although they do have that modern meat grinding  machinery that they could probably fool stupid vikings into putting their hands and saying that  there's some kind of magic in there i like how you think packer fans are too fat you just tip them  over they just roll down hill yeah so but packers they're they're meat packers that's why they got  the name packers so i'm thinking vikings are stupid so they could they can tell them there's some kind  of you know this is the way to um your holy land or something brett farve is having a great year 
[01:56:00]  all right what do you say i'm saying that the packers fool the vikings ah no he just went against  his whole theory because you know brett farve's having a great year no i didn't that's what you  did no no that theory stinks uh i'm not buying packers would have to use their meat packing  machinery as weapons oh against the vikings bunch of dummies dressed like paulie from the original  rocky the vikings would kill him smash his death i don't sweat you and they just cut his throat  also yeah they got those weird things too the maces it's amazing yeah also it's uh in green bay 
[01:56:30]  vikings can't bring their ships this is a mess hammers they're gonna be looking like they got  like battle hammers they're gonna trash them what about their let me think on this one two seconds  while we look at the detroit lions and the cardinals helmets too with the with the horns and stuff  matter cows have horns look at what the packers do to them all right well you'll get back to that  game let me think about that lions and cardinals same thing as the tigers uh i mean the bangles 
[01:57:00]  and the ravens the uh lions beat the cardinals every time yeah all right so now it's the vikings  and packers uh and one postponed game one yes one game that will never happen i'm gonna have to say  i'm gonna have to stick with the packers beating the vikings based on meat packing machinery uh totally  chewing up the vikings or they don't understand the concept they don't understand the concept of  machinery or they don't understand murder and rape or based on the fact that brett farm is having a 
[01:57:30]  great year i'm not basing this on anything but the name all right he really is doing that because  he's trying to make this stupid theory work by coming up i tricked them i mean packers you know  you were saying vikings all the way because i was i wasn't thinking uh broadly enough  so you'd rather fight a guy rather than some guy who has a 20 pound hammer he's about to smash  over you'd rather fight that that guy than some guy making a corned beef sandwich i have an  understanding of meat packing machinery i would never put my hand in there but one smart meat packer 
[01:58:00]  and all the vikings are reaching in for doubloons for gold and into a chopped meat machine they're not  they rape and pillage every fat girl in wisconsin is gonna be face down she's head i'm gonna be five  minutes after one i'm gonna be cursing you all weekend long i'm gonna be cursing you on sunday  you're gonna get a lot of emails from me pal that's a tough one i'm gonna say it's gonna be  close all right that's what i'll say very close game close to call yeah take the over all right  listen football picks sponsored by dish network it's time to get more tv from your tv sign up for

[02:00:30]  the next 15 minutes you got uh you got uh china in the news you got uh not the uh country huh  the uh hermaphrodite the thing yes she's been on our show whatever it is she was very sweet though  she was nice i feel bad that jay leno face yeah huh said with the jay leno face yeah they were  showing some like old footage of her and she had like the man jaw that she had reworked but china uh 
[02:01:00]  i guess the reason we're doing this because she's going after angry vince mcmahon  uh china like got kicked out of wrestling sam knows all this and she had to change her name  because like vince owns you so she had to start calling herself china doll china doll and then she  went to court yesterday and she got her name china back so now she's kind of flaunting it in vince  mcmahon's face like you don't control me anymore she's uh just about challenging him yeah well we got 
[02:01:30]  some audio uh china legally changes their name to china this is just big news i guess in the celebrity  world uh no we are here today because i got my identity back i won my name in court  from joan marie lauer legally to china and that's with a y  oh is that why we're here today i know he how empty did that parking lot sound  we are here today there's like a seagull in the background was she expecting this big ovation after 
[02:02:00]  that uh my name back china with a y yeah yeah finally a weight has been lifted off my chest a real  victory for everyone involved do the china line again please uh i finally got my name back china  with a y  that's why we're all here today 
[02:02:30]  are we really here today for this  this was an issue because out of spite i believe vince mcmahon has made my life  a living hell for the last eight years and this paper right here is a fight  for any wrestler for any person for any entity that vince mcmahon has tried to hurt for any  demographic i can pull in here anymore for all the lives that i think that he's basically destroyed 
[02:03:00]  because he there's no reason for him to put pressure to hurt people's lives except out of spite  because he's an you know egomaniac and he's a jerk well uh vince mcmahon is a genius he's a  billionaire of course he is he he makes these people bigger than life like china and then he  owns the name yeah so if you're so talented then you know you go off and do something else  she uh she was pretty big though when she was on there of course gotta say of course you know she 
[02:03:30]  kind of made the name something by doing what she did but uh yeah you sign away your life vince uh  he's done it to a lot of wrestlers if you if you come into the wwe and you don't have a name  yet and they give you like an identity and a name they own that  any more china oh sam's got something to add to this of course what do you got sam  no i'm just gonna say that's exactly it that i mean china was a character name 
[02:04:00]  so she's changing her name  oh i gotcha  way to reiterate i know i don't know why i didn't  why are we here today for the show  on behalf of everybody you've tried to steal their idea this is a this is great she calls out uh vince  mcmahon yeah now she's calling out vince and you'll realize why we uh play these clips calling you out  on behalf of everybody you've tried to steal their identity from steal their living from on behalf of all of those people i would like to go back to wrestling and kick your ass for one day do i want to go back to get abused by you and get punched in the head every day and have people not stand up for me besides the fans no that's a garbage truck go back for one 
[02:04:30]  yeah empty in the dumpster in the background she actually has step out of the way so that the dump truck can get through  the guy in the back 
[02:05:00]  this is just like uh when britney spears does something huh  dude and he's not stealing her identity that would be if he went out and got credit cards made and heard  yeah that's what i did i want to charge this and charge it on china's car  that's right china i'm buying stuff on your identity  your identity  whore with a big  i've seen the movie  your is the size of my 
[02:05:30]  you know what i'm talking about china  i'll accept any challenge  any challenge you want bring it on  bring it on you have a half man  come on i saw the sex tape  you really know how to  uh  don't you  bring it bring it  let me hear a challenge  with the garbage truck  let me play that for you with travis in kansas he writes this just in robin williams is legally changing his name to morphe 
[02:06:00]  it is the same thing basically  all right here we backed it up so you can hear the garbage truck because it's you know  good observation  used by you and get punched in the head every day and have people not stand up for me besides the fans  would i like to go back for one day  representing myself and all of these people to kick your ass and your ass only because you're the boss right vince 
[02:06:30]  then i'd love to do it  you know my number  you know where i live obviously  you know my name  bring it vince  you bring it  i would love nothing more than to kick your ass  oh wow  this is why you can tell  why she's not in in there  like that's what wrestlers are supposed to be good at  hyping the fight  and it's like when the rock does it it's great  yeah  or did it back in the day  she's  rock was amazing  she stinks  and i'm gonna kick your ass

[02:25:00]  yeah  and the backs were to the building  it would have got ugly  they knew it was time to make the move  and leave  or something bad was going to happen  not to criticize your interviewing skills  but there was really no segue from  oh you're from minnesota  to dude what the fuck happened  without any eyebrows  might have been a problem  well not only did she take her eyebrows out  and pencil in new ones  but she made it look like  she was surprised all the time  oh did yeah  the up and to the side  that's what women do  at some point in their life  they decide that they have to  take their eyebrows 
[02:25:30]  pluck every one of them out  and just pencil them in  it's awful  yeah i don't get that  yeah that thing  i think they get sick of getting ready  and what they try to do  is they try to take shortcuts  when they get older  and they you know  they get that little  the little lesbian  pompadour  that they'll get  the lesbian pompadour  yeah  the uh  lesbian stray cat  remember  yeah  they get that  that's the first thing  and then they always  they're just like  the husband always hates it 
[02:26:00]  and they're always psyched  oh my god i love it  it's so easy  just a little bit of moose  and the guy's like  yeah it's great  now i feel like  my friend steve  we have a whole  thank you  we have a whole bit on this  where you know  you get married  and the woman is very soft  and the long hair  and the makeup  and she's spending hours  just to go out to dinner  and then time goes by  and all of a sudden  yeah you're eventually  sleeping with your friend steve  no there's no reason  it's whatever's easier  but all of a sudden  like that nice long hair  that you like  that gets cut short  because it's  like you said  easy  yep  and more manageable 
[02:26:30]  and she doesn't have time  she's happy with her new body  and then you're fucked  right  it's over  and she's looking more and more  like a man every day  yeah  and then you're stuck with them  because you don't want to lose  half your shit  to a fucking  dyke haired  fatso  hey we gotta say hi to  Kevin Smith  big star  and a great friend  of the Opie and Anthony show  Kevin how are you buddy  good morning folks  how are you  I heard you were calling today  and I was psyched  yeah here I am  but unfortunately  you're in for a letdown 
[02:27:00]  I got nothing to talk about  no you always have  something to talk about  my friend  no nothing this time  no actually today  I have absolutely  nothing to talk about  I'm a blank slate  how did the book do man  how was your book  last time we saw you  just going on sale  we debuted at number 32  on the New York Times  best seller list  soft cover  which sounds bad  but was actually great  that's really good  awesome  I never thought it would chart man  I mean it's something  you could have read for free  on the net for years  and we're starting to play 
[02:27:30]  some of your old podcasts  on this channel  yeah you guys  it was last week  I guess  the podcast went up  so how to do  I think it did well  I mean there was some  nice feedback on it  right on  yeah absolutely  gonna keep doing it  we would love to  sweet I'm getting rich  so this is  this is Jim Norton  there was some  there was some talks  about a possible movie  opportunity  oh yeah remember that Kevin  what's up what what  I was saying  there was some talks  about a possible  movie opportunity  yes  I like that 
[02:28:00]  yes  oh wait no no  I mean like  where you were making one  and maybe you thought of me  yes  for a part  of course  you're in sir  we start shooting in January  oh good  alright Jim  you got a part  I wouldn't forget Jim  but Kevin I haven't gotten  my script yet  Jim is the little one right  yeah  Jim I know when I come  on the show  I always plug your stuff  but did you just put out  a new DVD  well it's actually  HBO put it out  it's my  the HBO special 
[02:28:30]  is now being sold  on DVD  right on  how's it doing  I don't know  I think they're happy  I mean  they call a lot  and they just talk about it  they go please plug it  so apparently  it's doing really well  I mean  they're giving it away  for free tonight  at Caroline's  which is always the sign  that your DVD  is selling like hotcakes  when they're like  look  it's actually going to be  cheaper to give these away  than send them back  to the warehouse  unsold  I think it's doing okay  actually  they have a good  marketing department  so yeah  so you guys are going to  keep running this podcast  on Saturday nights 
[02:29:00]  yeah absolutely  because we're hoping  for the big call  from Kevin Smith  we're all secretly  hoping that you're  seeing something in us  you know that right  yes  dude that's why I'm here  I'm sure we're not  telling you anything  you don't know already  I'm sure your own  friends and family  do it to you  they do  we're constantly  auditioning for you  we're always acting  in front of Kevin  like whenever he walks in  I kind of like lean  on one elbow  and I look dramatically  I'm like good point  Kevin  I walk into that room  I feel like Alan  fucking Aldis  yeah  bunch of Lucy  Ricardos in this room 
[02:29:30]  now Lucy  Kevin Smith  is coming to the studio  I don't want you  auditioning  when are you coming  back in  how come you're not in  I'm on the west coast  sir  kind of difficult  to make it  oh you're a sleepy boy  I head to Pittsburgh  this week  for  we're scouting  some more  and we're kind of  in the throes  of pre-production  right now  so at least I'm  closer  I'll at least  be in the same  time zone  what do you think  about this writer's  strike  how long  me I'm hoping  it's done by Christmas 
[02:30:00]  not like it  it doesn't look like it  man  I've been watching  a lot of video clips  on the web  the writer's guild  has it's own  like YouTube channel  so you can watch  a bunch of writers  out on the picket lines  and being joined  by actors  and what not  it's kind of inspiring  though it hasn't  inspired me  to get out on the line  because apparently  it requires  a bunch of walking  yeah  for some reason  I mean  look I love  the writer's guild  and I'm a writer  and part of the guild  and go union  and all that shit  but I haven't worked out 
[02:30:30]  in three years  I'm not going to start  now for this  well you're kind of  at the point though  where you can stand there  like everybody else does  the celebrities  that show up  just stand there  if they have a  standing section  I'm there  oh man  I saw the standing  section yesterday  Kevin here in New York  it was  where are they  picketing in New York  it was in front of  Time Warner  well Time Warner  yesterday  and they had the  standing section  which had Robin Williams  Richard Belzer  who else  Roseanne  Tim Robbins 
[02:31:00]  Tim Robbins  they were in the  standing section  waiting to be interviewed  see if you got those  massive celebrities  out there  you don't need  a fucking silent  Bob showing up  no  yes  no it's good PR  if you got Robin Williams  standing out there  striking  that's more  attention grabbing  than like  hey wouldn't that dude  didn't fucking die hard  for three minutes  not to lap your ass  but I think more people  would be coming up to you  yeah  you're a bit more  intelligent than most  of the people  we just named  I think most of the  people that come up  to me  just mistake me 
[02:31:30]  for somebody  they went to high  school  it's really interesting  watching celebrities  though  they're always looking  for their opportunity  because like  the writers  were doing the lap  and walking  the picket line  and these guys  were just hanging  around making believe  they had something  to do  but what they really  were doing  was making sure  they stayed close  to the cameras  waiting for them  to go  hey hey  what you do  is you show up  with free food  like donuts  or like pizza  smiling waving  that's the thing  that keeps me  from going man  is like  you don't want 
[02:32:00]  people to think  you're going  for the wrong reason  for me  it's enough  to stop writing  and striking  I think if I'm  if I show  I don't know  I look at it  from the perspective  of like  the people I know  who are not  in the movie business  who are just like  I don't understand  why famous people  are going  aren't they rich  and I'm like  ugh  that's the thing  you don't want  people taking it  wrong man  you should show up  with a bucket  of cold water  and throw it  on them  and start yelling  back to work  back to work  I'm a strike buster 
[02:32:30]  get back to work  it's 20 degrees out  come down  with that piece  of 2x4  I'd be an old time  strike  it'd be kind of  interesting  to like  try to cross  the picket line  and get punched  in the face  by Tina Fey  break up a strike  like Lee J Cobb  and fucking  on the waterfront  when it broke  him down  Ellen DeGeneres  is a strike buster  is she  she's still  doing that show  she decided  to go back  to work  and in honor  of the writer  she's not  going to do  a monologue  so what she  maintains  is aside  from the monologue 
[02:33:00]  that show  is not written  whatsoever  no she  it's all  personality  right  it's all her  she's very talented  it's all about her  she's just going  to dance a lot  longer  she said  that a lot  of people  made their  vacation plans  to see her  show and all  and you know  don't want to  disappoint them  you can't let  down the common  man  can't let  down the fat  the fat mom  from kansas  yeah it's more  important that  some fucking  twat from the  midwest  is more important  than writers  getting their  fucking  what they're  due for the  next 10 years  all I know  is going to  prolong us  getting back 
[02:33:30]  to lost  which kind  of irritates  me  oh see  another lost  fan  that's me  too  I'm like  I know  they got  a few  made  but  I gotta  find out  what happened  so I  could have  no clue  what's  happening  and I  don't know  if this  is wrong  to admit  but I  missed  an episode  of 30 Rock  and I was  just watching  it online  this morning  I think  that's part  of the problem  as well  because they  do run ads  during this  thing  I'm watching  the 30 Rock  episode  and there's  like three  ads for Dove  Soap  so obviously  they know  how to  monetize  this shit  and that's  the writer's  the writer's  beef  is just  like  hey man  network TV 
[02:34:00]  has stopped  doing the  traditional  rerun  like you  won't see  during  Heroes  initial run  last year  they never  reran  that show  but you  can go  to like  a website  to the  NBC website  or you  can go  to iTunes  at the  time  because NBC  doesn't deal  with iTunes  anymore  and download  the episode  and buy  it  so they  found  crafty ways  to like  jip writers  out of their  residuals  and that's  the shitty  holy shit  I just  realized  there's no  reruns  anymore  it was  very like  there was  no announcement  there was  no like  guess what  we're getting  rid of reruns  it was just  all quiet 
[02:34:30]  and insidious  because they  found a way  to revenue  streams  with it  yeah  they just  put it  up online  do they  pay actors  on those  things on  the internet  that's an  excellent  question  and I  guess that's  why SAG  is showing  a lot of  solidarity  with the  writers  guilt  strike  because  as go  the writers  so goes  SAG  to some  degree  and they've  got their  contracts  up I  think in  the summer  or something  but yeah  that's a  if those  guys get  a hit  off  it  I guess  not  and do  you know  what the  writers  are striking  for  I mean  aside from  some of 
[02:35:00]  the more  obvious  things  like the  home video  issue  this DVD  thing  like there's  4%  I don't even  know if it's  4%  essentially  on every  dollar  that they  make off  of a DVD  I think  writers get  2.5 cents  and that  has been  the same  for 20  years  I mean  because it  goes back  to VHS  how much  do they want  they're looking  for just  double that  sir  yeah  5%  I mean  maybe  8 or  something  but what  it is  whatever  it is  it is  such  it's 
[02:35:30]  pennies  man  wasn't that a  screw up  a residual  check that is  less than  a fucking  postage  sam  wasn't that a  screw up  on the  unions part  back 20  years ago  and they  kind of  looked at it  and said  ah this  won't really  when the  video market  was growing  the writers  guild  made a  concession  because it  was a  new  media  and they  were like  look  we'll  take a  small  percentage  as opposed  to asking  for a larger  cut  because it's  just like  if you buy  a book  right  every time  you buy  a book  every time  you buy  a copy  of harry potter  every time  a copy  of harry potter  sells  JK Rowling  gets a taste  every time  an album  sells 
[02:36:00]  either  as a CD  or prior  to that  records  and even  now  with digital  downloads  the artists  get a taste  but with  writers on TV  it's  basically  it's the  one airing  now  it used to  be  once it  aired  and then  when it  went into  reruns  and then  when it  went into  syndication  but they've  kind of  insidiously  gotten rid  of the  rerun  so  and a lot  of these  cats  man  it's like  you know  a lot  of people  think  Hollywood  people make  so much  money  people at  work in TV  make so much  money  and there  are some  people that  absolutely do 
[02:36:30]  but there  are some  cats like  a struggling  writer who  has to live  off one episode  that they got  their name on  you know  for like the  rest of their  lives  and it's not  just like the  pennies that  come in  it's also  you know  your pension  and your  medical  which in this  country is  very  I sound like  I'm a  writers guild  advocate  I know  this is an  informed  motherfucker  I like  getting the  knowledge  I should  pick up a  picket sign  and get my  fat ass out  there  but I'm  going to  Pittsburgh  yeah you're  busy  you can walk 
[02:37:00]  the line in  Pittsburgh  I'm sure  there's some  local network  affiliate there  that can stand  in front of  and piss on  the front door  you're scouting  for  Jack and  Mary make  a porno  sir  which we  fully cast  up and we  make our  announcement  a week from  today actually  a week from  today on  who the  cast is  who Zach  and Mary  are  who's going  to play  them  anyone we  know  yes  absolutely  how about  you make  the announcement  on our show 
[02:37:30]  we could use  a little buzz  on the internet  I'll do it  simultaneously  Friday morning  I'll call you  guys up  at the same  time  at the same  exact time  the newspaper  hits a stand  I'll be like  hey  big names  though huh  yeah  we got  real  we're blessed  this time  around  has every  part been  cast  Kev  not every  part  I ain't  lying dude  there's definitely  a part for you  it ain't huge  but you know  it'll be key  and it'll  cater directly  to your talents  oh great 
[02:38:00]  she's gonna have you  in a tranny  somewhere  like apologizing  to a police  hall  I thought it  was a girl  I just like  big clitorises  there's a scene  where a somewhat  slight dude  has a tranny  brick right in  his mouth  do you consider  me  hopefully  he doesn't  think I'm  slight  I get to  play the  tranny  that would  be kind  of nice  the  hey man  after I was  on  remember when I  was on the show  last time  what was it  two girls  one cup  oh yeah  that thing  has like  exploded  now  people keep  telling me  links to it 
[02:38:30]  and I'm like  hey man  did you hear  the ONA show  and they're like  no somebody  sent me this  link  I think you  guys may have  unearthed that  I really did  too man  yeah that was  like  because now  we're doing  reactions  right  I've seen that  where people  are just like  oh  yeah it's  hysterical to  watch people  watching that  it's that  it's that  awful  that people  just watching  it is funny  to watch  it's pretty  horrible  but  the first  person that  sent me that  link  I immediately  got email  give credit  to ONA  they found  it  Kevin can you 
[02:39:00]  humor us  because we  got Bill  Byrne in  the studio  very funny  guy and he's  never seen  two girls  one cup  and this is  what's going  on on the  internet  so people  are now  filming  people watching  the video  not the video  anymore  with all the  programming  the first run  programming  the written  programming  that's now  missing on the  network  just run  this  yeah  that would  have been  fantastic  the ultimate  reality show  all you need  to do is  feed someone  Bill you've  never seen  two girls

[02:40:00]  two girls  in one cup  two girls  one cup  it's kind of  like  two and a half  men  yeah  kind of  in a cup  or two guys  a girl  in a pizza  parlor  it's in that  two tradition  you know what  I did an episode  of that  pizza place  right  yeah  did you  I had five  lines  five words  what'd you say  this show  fucking  all right  Kevin  we're ready  for two girls  one cup  here's Bill  Burr's reaction  I'm Bill Burr  now Bill  just watch

[02:41:30]  Bill  I wonder when  they script this  if he goes  all right but  first you kiss  with the shit  in the mouth  and then you  vomit the shit  into her mouth  no no no no  don't vomit the  shit first  you're going to  kill the  baby bird  they stole it  they stole it  oh my god  they stole our  baby bird  that is so  just heinous  wait is there  any sound in that  there should be  it's silent  do they talk  some old lady  plays the piano  like a silent film  there is some  kind of music to it  there's no talking  I'm not sure  our Brazilian girl 
[02:42:00]  from yesterday  was here  I would love to  have her tell us  what they say  because I never  know what they're  saying in that  filthy scat porn  oh my god  I love when my  smoothie comes  right after this  video  yeah here's the  music I guess  that plays  it's just some  nice piano Kevin  in the background  as this horrific  thing is happening  yeah that is nice  alright that's it  it's the appropriate  music  how do they find  two girls  and one cup  no  the girl's reason  that they have  a cup shortage  in fucking  no girl 
[02:42:30]  girls that hot  that would actually  you know  they're poor  yeah  they need money  to tie it back  into the writer's  strike  if they don't  end the strike soon  writers will be  forced into those  situations  yes two writers  one cup  you'll see like  Greg Daniels  and Damon Lindelof  from Lost  to do one cup  they'll lick shit  out of Ellen's  content  no one makes  that video  it's just simply  the name of the  video  because it's  horrific videos  all over the  internet  but two girls  one cup  just is 
[02:43:00]  a perfect name  sounds like a  karate movie  yeah  crashing dragon  flying cup  show him  show him  poo button  poo button  adorable  yeah we haven't  done poo button  in a while  although poo button  is a come down  after two girls  one cup  why don't we  just pop up  Lemon Party  and discuss that  Kevin you gotta  help us discuss  Lemon Party  wait Kevin you  got a computer  nearby  I do  I want you to  play along at  home  you gotta pop up  lemonparty.org 
[02:43:30]  hold on one second  and we wanna get  your opinion on  this picture  cause we're trying  to figure out  who the gayest  guy is  alright what's it  called  lemonparty.org  the trick is  you gotta look  l-e-m-o-n  yeah lemon  why do you guys  watch this shit  why would you  do that  why would you  want that  in your fucking  heart  what you gotta  figure with this  one is if you  had to be  somebody  I'm not  watching  it's a picture  I just have  a page holder  is it  lemonparty.org  is that it  last time I looked  at one of your 
[02:44:00]  videos like this  some guy's foot  all the way up  to somebody's ass  wait we're trying  to get Kevin  on board here  wait l-e-m-o-n-p-a-r-t-y  dot com  dot org  it must be an  organization  but now the trick  is if you had  to be someone  in this picture  who would you  be  okay  it's loading  alright once again  it's three very  old guys  naked  one guy's  blind  I'd be the  Asian  which Asian  with a Don  Ho face  oh you think  that guy's Asian  I thought that 
[02:44:30]  too  now why  cause he's like  touching the  guy's chest  that's pretty  right the other  guy's got a  dick in his  mouth  and the other  guy is  getting fucking  manhandled by  two guys  so I would  go for  you go for  the guy  on top  he seems  like he  can make  the easiest  escape  we have  Arnold Palmer  we call him  Arnold Palmer  the guy laying  down is Ed  Koch  getting the  blowjob  the other guy's  Thurston Howell  or he could  say we have  really queer  who's the guy  blowing  lucky devil 
[02:45:00]  and Mr.  Affectionist  you got the  picture there  no  all I have  is audio  of you guys  from an earlier  show  that's weird  Mr.  Affectionist  has the  exact same  did they put  our audio  up on  Lemon Party  I'm trying  to get there  but it won't  load up  that's a good  point by Bill  Mr.  Affectionist  has a red  face and a  red cock  it was like  he just  that was a  really creepy  tanning job  do I have to  click the  register button  he went in  with the  scuba suit 
[02:45:30]  he left the  fly down  you don't  want to  register to  anything  don't make  me register  no don't  do www  just do  lemonparty.org  yeah let's  try that  that's nowhere  nearly as  horrific  oh I've seen  this picture  but we  discuss this  now every  day  if you have  to be  somebody  in this  picture  who would  you be  Mr.  Affectionist  tell Kevin  the participants  obviously Kevin  you see Arnold  Palmer  sucking dick  right  Ed Koch 
[02:46:00]  is laying  down  and then  he's getting  his dick  sucked  as he  deep kisses  the  looks like  Mr.  Miyagi  yeah Mr.  Miyagi  actually you know  what  wax on  wax on  yes  as far as  identity  purposes  you want to  be Ed Koch  because you  can't quite  tell what he  looks like  he can play  it off like  but if you  had to be  one of those  guys  which one  would you  choose  Kevin  I'm  kind of  well my  nature tells  me to be  the giver  because I'm  a giver  by nature  but I think 
[02:46:30]  you know  for the  purposes of  the radio  show I'll  have to  say that  I'll be  Ed Koch  the taker  the receiver  of the gift  I think  he's actually  dead  and the one  guy is a  mortician  and he's  like look  they're  coxed there  hard for a  few hours  so he sucks  it while his  friend came over  and just kissed  the body  and they're laughing  while they do  this  necrophiliac  porn man  older  senior citizen  necrophiliac  porn  nice  and the guy  right now  is blowing  and he's  trying to  sneak the  watch off  the body  that's why  his hand  is on the  guy's  fucking  outer thigh  he wants 
[02:47:00]  to steal  that smart  watch  I gotta say  though  this kind  of makes  me happy  because apparently  even in old age  people are still  just dogs  just horny  fucking dogs  still shaming  their father  even in their  old age  look at the  horror that  happens to the  human body  just ravaged  oh  yeah  but apparently  it could still  work  I love old  dog dick  though  Mr. Affection  it's fucking  red awful  sore dick  yeah the  dude that's  getting blown  seems to  have no  balls  yeah what  the hell  happened there 
[02:47:30]  they're probably  hangers  they're eunuch  oh he's  sitting on  him  maybe he  tucked him  back because  he's trying  to trick  him into  thinking he's  a girl  oh that is  funny he does  have no  balls good  point it's  just hair  all over  are you guys  going to  analyze this  thing like  we have  been over  and over  I don't know  why we have  to go over  this every day  it's just like  the Kennedy  assassination  right there  the guy  getting blown  his black  dog  driver  the driver  shot him  in the dick  I got a  problem with  the deep 
[02:48:00]  kissing  maybe it's  the early  morning hour  for me  because it's  not even  7 o'clock  here but  I find this  oddly arousing  I like to  think of my  grandfather like  this  that's sweet  I love Arnold  Palmer man  he's great  which one is  he the guy  with the cock  in his mouth  yeah  get a picture  of Arnold  Palmer and  that's him  right there  I just love  the stiff  posture on the  guy laying  there getting  blown  he has no  personality at all  he's just laying  there like go  ahead suck the  big boy  and the other  guy is just  letting kiss him  because he's too  tired to fight 
[02:48:30]  him off  he's normally  not even  affectionate  he probably  just likes to  get sucked  and ignore you  but  we have a bleachers  full of  hot chicks too  a live audience  and  we're discussing  I'm sorry  old men  blowing each  other  the Brazilian  girl with her  boyfriend is here  we have two  girls from  Ohio  we have a  man with  fucking 1970  mutton shops  and he's got a  couple of hot  girls next to  him  we have a  fucking good  crew out there  today  why don't you  guys just reenact  the picture with  some of the  audience members  alright

[02:49:30]  no more phone  calls  it's very  interesting times  for us  and that's our  take on the  whole thing  that's our  comment  that's amazing  man because I  didn't think that  was going to  happen  yeah well  who saw that  coming  when did you  find out  late last night  that's why I'm  a little tired  you know  it kept me up  all night  and I didn't  sleep at all  dude if I knew  that I never  would have moved  to LA  what fucking  dope I am  what are you  going to do  let's get back  to our interview  with Kevin Smith  he's on the line  live from LA  Kevin  wait I missed  the merger thing  what'd you hear  got a little

[02:51:00]  there's a  the police presence  looks like  something out of  Conquest of the  Planet of the  Earth  there are just  so many police  around  and of course  I don't use that  in any racial  sense of the term  there are so  many police  around  it's a total  police state  you're safe  safe as  someone's got  trouble for that  right  for the people  out of the area  you gotta  explain this  Newark is a  shithole  but it's  coming back  Newark's coming  back in such  a big way  man the arena  changed everything  now it's just  it's a joy  to drive around  and dude  you can walk 
[02:51:30]  around in it  coming back  to what  it's coming  back  I don't ever  remember people  like Sinatra  singing about  Newark  Newark  Newark  good point  Bill  I guess  yeah you're  right  we're gonna  revitalize  Trenton  we're gonna  revitalize  something  that was  always a  shithole  but it's  not to the  point where  I'm ready  to like  take a look  yet Kevin  oh it's  when are the  Islanders  playing there  I don't know 
[02:52:00]  I gotta look  at the schedule  you're gonna go  actually I'd  probably go  to check out  all you need  to do now  to revitalize  an area  you need a  new sporting  complex  and like a  cheesecake  factory  and then  enough fat  white people  will come  floating in  and they'll  consider it  revitalized  it's a pretty  stellar place  man  it looks  fantastic  lots of  places to  eat  well that's  important  yeah of course  if you're going to  a hockey game  all you want to  do is eat  there's oxygen  you can breathe 
[02:52:30]  there  it reminds me  of going to  see the Yankees  why  well they  figure  it's in a  horrific area  and they figured  that out though  they built  like 20 foot  fences and  everything  so you park  your car  like is my  car gonna be  safe here  and then there's  police all around  and then you  like follow the  maze of fences  to the stadium  yep  it's a week  from today  dude  Islanders  at the  Devils  Friday  November 16th  alright now I  need tickets  I don't have  tickets for  Devil games  Devil's games  don't you have 
[02:53:00]  connections with  the Islanders  probably  just call them  up and ask  to be seated  but I made fun  of Al Arbor  night so maybe  I don't anymore  yeah  is Mike Milbury  still over with  the Islanders  nah they got  rid of him  you gotta learn  to play the  game sir  you're burning  bridges  yeah don't be  not where free  tickets are concerned  well Jimmy  started and then  I couldn't  agree more  Jimmy wow  I don't even  know who  these people are  that was nice  remember the  Al Arbor bit  we did  oh that's  faggot  the legendary  Islanders coach  they bring him  back because 
[02:53:30]  they figured out  that he was one  game away from  1500 games  coach so as a  gesture he was  in the you know  hanging with the  players and doing  absolutely nothing  it was I don't know  he suggested a  couple things and  they just said  shut the fuck up  and sit down  shut the fuck up  we'll get you  your win and you  can go home  shut up we gave  you a corsage  we just stand  there  because you  watch shit  dick  see Kevin I  can't help it  we get dragged  in  hey man let me 
[02:54:00]  ask you guys a  question completely  off topic  you guys are all  my spaced out but  have you Facebooked  yet  no not really  nah I haven't  done the Facebook  what's the difference  pretty genius dude  I joined on  Monday  yeah  and then on  Wednesday I had  5000 friends which  apparently is the  max you can't have  more than 5000  why would anyone  want to waste  their time on  fucking face  cock  because then they  opened up a  secondary like you  can open up a  secondary page where  you can go beyond  the 5000 but  it's generally just  for you know  friends and 
[02:54:30]  and people you  communicate with  why do they limit  it to 5000 people  because I don't  think it was  it was conceived  as like not so  much the anti  myspace but just  an alternative to  myspace where it  wasn't just  approve everyone  you know but  that's the way I  want to bet  I hear from  other people that  have told me it's  just full of  pedophiles  is it  wow great acting  Kevin  that's what I've  heard  now I'm alarmed 
[02:55:00]  because I put up  pictures of my  kid  oh Jesus  and pictures of me  as a kid  see you know  what's going on  today in our  studio  we have the  fine people from  myspace in here  videotaping  Jimmy  videotaping the  whole crew  really  myspace  I got 165  thousand  myspace fans  do you really  I got 57  thousand  I'm sorry  friends  165 thousand  I fucking  stalled at  less than 60  what a piece of  shit I am  I always feel  good about that  until I realize 
[02:55:30]  Dane Cook has  like 2 million  oh Dane Cook  has fucking  half of Asia  and the old  Soviet Union  all wrapped up  you can't judge  by Dane Cook  he's actually  doing a gig  on a fucking  island  they're flying  people in  200,000  dude you know  what's funny  about that  like I was  on the road  down to DC  I'm trying  to fill a  goddamn  improv  and they're  bringing up  you know  Dane's playing  where the  fucking  Washington Wizards  play  it's like  great dude  I'm sure  he's beaming  it from  the space  shuttle  can you  help me  fill a  funny bone  god bless  him but  I'm trying  to make  some money  here 
[02:56:00]  I don't  know  the guy  wow  look at  them just  beating  this woman  well they're  very good  in Pakistan  at political  discourse  we're just  watching this  Pakistan  footage  they're having  a bit  of a problem  over there  in Pakistan  yes  and people  just seem  to be beating  people in  the streets  and the  news just  loves showing  it  like we  don't show  us really  beating  our own  people in  the streets  on the  news  and if we  do it's  followed by  a court  case and  a riot 
[02:56:30]  yeah  here though  we just  we love  watching people  in far away  lands  fucking each  other up  well there's  two women  just  they're  apparently  fighting over  whose  cunt  smells  the worst  and they  declared it  a draw  because  they released  gulls  and six  landed on  each  woman's  crotch  that's how  they test  over there  whose cunt  smells the  most  like a  fucking  dumpster  the cadaver  pussy contest  it's like  American Idol  here  a bunch of  mustachioed  savages  holy shit  Jimmy  fucking just 
[02:57:00]  belting each  other  look at her  getting  pummeled  up  and they  keep  they're  playing it  over and  over again  she took  some good  ones  they're  pulling her  hair out  everyone's  getting involved  what did she  do aside  from just  be a woman  I don't know  she had  the audacity  to have a  vagina  it's all  women fighting  there's no  guys hitting  them  the guys  are hitting  women are  hitting her  oh there  are other  women hitting  one woman  it's all  women  there's two  sides in this  whole thing  over there  and they seem  to not agree  to my conclusion  from watching 
[02:57:30]  the video  look at those  awful police  uniforms  they have  it's like  they bought  them at a  Halloween  costume shop  this isn't  quite  Pakistan  related  but I  finally saw  The Kingdom  last night  did anyone  see The Kingdom  no  the movie  that was just  out  I didn't  get my  screener copy  oh it's  good  damn it  I never  go to the  movies anymore  who's in  that one  30 days  of night  no  is that  any good  yeah that  one's good  it had a  good concept 
[02:58:00]  I like the  idea of  like you know  vampires and  Alaska  where you  know they  got like  all that  time where  there's  zero sun  wow  it was alright  I saw  vampires just  go there  Kingdom was  fucking  spellbinding  really  such an  insanely  well made  movie  that dude  Peter Berg  he used to be  an actor  now he's a  director more  he directed  the Friday  Night Lights  the movie  and he's also  kind of behind  the show a little  bit but I mean  the movie he  made that dude's  a fucking good  filmmaker man  yeah  what's that  what's the  what's that movie  about though  the basic gist 
[02:58:30]  of it  yeah  it's set in  Saudi Arabia  where apparently  you know  since the 50s  America has  had a  base slash  town  where it looks  like a little  version of  America  in the middle  of Saudi Arabia  it's protected  it's got walls  and what not  and then there's  a terrorist attack  in the middle  of it  and the FBI  have to fight  their way in  to solve the  crime  because there's  all sorts of  laws that  prohibit them  from putting  foot on  Saudi soil  so it's  Jamie Foxx  Jen Garner  Jason Bateman 
[02:59:00]  and Chris  Cooper  have to go  in and figure  out who  was responsible  for the  terrorist attack  but the  first fucking  five minutes  of that movie  will ensure  that you  never leave  this country  ever again  really  okay  it's really  what I mean  I hate to say  because I'm sure  Saudi Arabia  has its charms  but good lord  you watch movies  like that  and you're just  like alright  so that's the  movie version  which probably  isn't nearly as  intense as the  real life version  I'm happy to  stay in my home  yeah  well 
[02:59:30]  brutal  what's the  worst that  happens here  you're a college  kid and Kevin  Smith yells at  you  or somebody  turns you on  to two girls  one cup  yeah  OJ is  in court  today huh  yeah it's so  cool to see him  back in court  he looks the  same only his  head's fatter  he can't be  sweating this  if you beat a  double murder  rap  yeah he's  looking at  this like  come on  it's memorabilia  stuff  who cares  he knows  he stole  the suit  you guys see  that email  that's going 
[03:00:00]  around like  the picture  of OJ Simpson  age 6  and it takes  place at  it's just  one photo  it's an image  of a kid's  birthday party  and a little  white girl  blowing out  the can of  the cake  and there's  a little  black kid  next to her  all right  there  I think we  should go to  our audience  why are we  wasting our  audience  well yeah  we got a  Brazilian girl  in here today  Kevin  she almost 
[03:00:30]  showed her  hiney yesterday  and now  today she's  here with her  boyfriend  so I think  there's a  connection there  yes  he wants her  to show her  he's going to  supervise  yes  is she truly  from Brazil  yes  she's Brazilian  do you know  anything about  Brazilian fart porn  um  hmm  Brazilian fart porn  I'm sorry  I couldn't hear that  do you know  anything about  Brazilian  come in  come in  it's really good  to have her  with no headphones  in a soundproof room  I know  and talk to her  give her a mic  I've been sitting on her  for the last 10 minutes 
[03:01:00]  I was wondering  why she wouldn't respond  do you know anything  about Brazilian fart porn  um I think so  yeah totally  you do  it's pretty popular  it's popular  over here it's pretty popular  so I hear about it a lot  yeah  um yeah  why did you bring  your boyfriend today  uh he actually  is the one that put me  onto the show  so  oh really  okay then we gotta  like him  yeah  unfortunately we gotta  like him  and you know  he's great though  is he great  yeah  is he though really  yeah totally  what does he do  for you  what is the criteria  for Greg  what does he do 
[03:01:30]  for you  um he's just  he's just my best  friend and  aww  he's a good person  very sweet  aww  that best friendness  goes a long way  yeah  yeah  yeah  how's the sex life  oh it's awesome  oh really  very good  he's a quiet guy  he's probably packing  a fucking big hog  he's probably really  angry when he fucks  he probably doesn't talk  and all he just grunts  give his name out  give his name out  what do you want to  give his first name out  uh his name's Brian  Brian  it's Brian huh  so that when they break up  he's got a better shot  at hooking up again  oh man 
[03:02:00]  hey I like that  I don't know  how old are you  22  you're 22  and how old is he  23  23  yeah  has she ever been  to Carnival  uh no  I haven't either  so  how long have you been  going out  uh a year  a year  and uh  first boyfriend  no  okay  sorry dude  I'm not gonna  you know  we won't have a  fucking clerk scene  over here  where you tell him  how many dicks  that's the story

[03:04:00]  this bashful ass  safe to say  though eight or nine  is a little low  it could be a couple more  it could be a couple more  15  was it a little hazy  like maybe you had  a few  drinking a few  or something  maybe  that's usually  what happens  early on  like that  more so  earlier  in your sexual activity  or later  later  later  so you kind of  caught on  and  went on a rampage  did you ever  give it up  because you were  bored  yeah  wow

[04:11:00]  right  I know  Pepper Hicks has experience  he's good at making  intro songs  you make those intro songs  I have a good taste in music  not just obsessive Rob's  so you have a good taste in music  we do a talk show  we have a good taste in humor  and that's why tomorrow  you'll get more laughs  more quality programming  and more professionalism  more rich boy bullshit  you guys  these guys seem a little more  shock oriented  with the bestiality thing  well that's  that's the crutch  is that just the crutch  what's interesting  to our drunken 
[04:11:30]  trucker listeners  sounds like Sam's been  reading some old  Opie and Anthony articles  what the fuck  we won't  we can't really talk  iPhones and fucking  stock markets  from 12 to 3  if you know what I mean  you ain't gonna have  a fucking PBS conversation  on all shit like that  not from 12 to 3  it's gonna be  about the streets  and just shit that goes on  and hanging out  I think it's a competition  to see who can say  fuck the most  throwing down  the dirty gauntlet  I wanted to say 
[04:12:00]  well we're on XM  might as well  just make sure you  listen to our friends  Ron and Fez  from 12 to 3 today  did you guys remember  to do that  oh no  alright  that's the biggest  hit right there  because Ronnie's  gonna pick up on that  he's gonna go  my boys are out there  and they don't even  mention the show  the other guys  the rich pieces of shit  they had to mention  the Ron and Fez show  you have some points  off for that  my friend  what are the Ron and Fez  are they hot  I don't even feel  we have to mention them  but yeah  they are from 12 to 3  why not  good try  at an excuse  or cover up  because Ronnie's 
[04:12:30]  gonna chew your ass apart  are you saying  it's just a matter of time  before you guys  replace Ron and Fez  I think that's what I heard  no not at all  we'll take out that  Sam first  and then work your way  toward Ron and Fez  no not Ron and Fez  just the industry  and drama  I think Ronnie's  gonna be playing  this tape back  and hear it  a little differently  yeah exactly  but why high society  why is it called  high society  just cause we scumbags  that like to get high  so we figured  oh it's that type of high  yeah  it's like  a word play  I thought it was like  the old porno magazine  we're not boy scouts  like that  isn't there a magazine 
[04:13:00]  oh no affiliation  to the porn magazine  is that a little catchphrase  we're not boy scouts  no  that'd be good  put that in a promo  yeah  like a t-shirt  so like I was saying  before  quickly  how do you determine  who is the victor  nobody's thought  that far in advance  ah good  it's all happening  very soon  what tomorrow night  oh yeah  and no one knows  and that's the reason  we decided to jump  on this bit  at 11.20  on Friday  I've been awkwardly 
[04:13:30]  trying to bring it up  to all  without sounding like  I'm off of an ass  for about two weeks  oh that was just great  fucking great man  wonderful  are you topless over there  no  what happened to you  being topless  I ruined it an hour ago  yeah I did  is that what you want  no he wants you topless  no we're gonna give you  a couch though  uh Bronx Johnny  make sure Ranafez knows  uh know  that she came from Akron  drove all night  she got naked for us 
[04:14:00]  she's going to see  Jimmy tonight  at Caroline's  free show  7 o'clock  thanks to MySpace  and free drinks  so she needs to take a nap  so let her sleep  during the show today  cool beans though  alright  so how are we gonna  determine the winner  of uh this uh  program  just listen  it's gonna be very obvious  who wins  Dan and Sam  will win  how about  like we always do  let me  let me maybe uh  do a little work today  no  use my brain  how about  so you both have  three hours  yes  yeah  so why don't you like  um  bring in your best segment 
[04:14:30]  from the show  and we'll have a little uh  competition that way  you got three hours  to come up with  something good  alright that's cool  perfect  and then next week  we get a segment  from you  a segment from you  and we can do it  or Ron and Fez can do it  whoever  and then we'll uh  have some kind of  voting going on  that sounds perfect  awesome  right  sure  yeah  cause it's too much  pressure to entertain  for three hours  we hope to entertain  I don't know  40 minutes is good for us  the rest of this shit  is filler  let's be honest  so it takes a little  pressure off 
[04:15:00]  you got three hours  to come up with  one good segment  how long should  the segment be  how long is a good  segment from  from high society  just  you guys go long  we're kids  four or five minutes  four or five minutes  is that fair  four or five minutes  you want to go long  form  yeah  you gotta go long  it's gotta be  you guys will know  the first time  you guys do a good  segment  you'll realize  you have to  give it some time  you'll feel in your bones  very exciting  or we can just have  you call in again  and just say how  you're first now 
[04:15:30]  and comparing the shit  to our first one  well I needed to give  you guys a boost  of something  you needed some kind  of something  to your first show  so I called in  and gave you something  this is the most  boring shit talking  I've ever heard  in my life  it's alright  it's just not  going anywhere  you guys  speak up in minute  20 Bill  when the fuck  were you 20 minutes  ago  I thought it was  gonna get heated  it looked like  it was gonna get heated  yeah it was  for a little while  he was saying  some crazy shit  and I was just  getting  you guys  battling with segments  oh we got a pillow  for Akron girl  go ahead  there's your 
[04:16:00]  see she is tired  she got right up  just trying to  stir it up then  that's all  you guys are doing  great man  I'm just trying  to fucking  throw a little  gas on the fire  that's all  hold on a second  where's your sister  gonna sleep  she got to sleep  in the car  so she's alright  kinda  she's cool  I'm gonna drive  all night  alright  you go take a nap  with my robe  there you go  I think you should  be naked  because it gets  a little hot  in here  what  what happened  nothing 
[04:16:30]  it's great  whatever  alright  no that's okay  oh  bright lights  yeah the lights  are a little much  right down on her  face as it's on a  pillow  why don't we  turn that light  off  she looks like  she's on display  right  this could be  our art project  let's call some  museums in New York  nothing  so five minutes  sure  sounds good  well you both  have to agree  can you do  something cool  we agree  do you wanna do  yeah  yeah five minutes  is easy  we'd do any  amount of time  one segment 
[04:17:00]  five minutes  and that's what  it's judged on  that's a little  light  listen to our  feedback  you're gonna have  listen to our  feedback too  cause you're gonna  have some  crossover listeners  are they gonna  vote on like  party lines though  oh I don't know  that wouldn't be fair  I don't know  I think people  have better judgment  I don't think  people will be that  loyal I think  their better judgment  will come into play  just faith in  people's nature  we really wanna have  like  oh I don't know  boo  alright this is 
[04:17:30]  very exciting  the set up was  terrific  I thought so  yeah  thank you  well it's been  going on for so  long  anything else  you guys want  to bring to the  table  I think it's  been amped up  I got first  are you really  pissed or is that  I am a little  pissed  I'm fucking  pissed now  are you  yes  cause he didn't  do well on  Opie and Anthony  I'd be pissed  no cause I missed  I missed the fucking  Ron and Fez plug  that's what I'm  pissed about  when did you start  working for Ron and Fez  nine months ago  oh shit  I'm gonna start 
[04:18:00]  paying attention  I know  like who the fuck  is that guy  what have you done  on Ron and Fez  that we would  know  I do the  openers  and I cut up  a bunch of  the best of  I took out  all the  WNW stuff  after the two  years  since Earl  couldn't do it  Sam why don't you  tell them what  you've done  for the  opening  athlete show  in the last  year  have you seen  any of those  videos  that have been  YouTube hits  or on the  big screen  you hold the  camera  and edited  and directed  I don't know  have you heard  Mick Foley feeds  Sam's steak  that was me  the underoos 
[04:18:30]  were on  and they were  snug  my bad  over your  pants  oh yeah  that was a big  hit though  when Mick Foley  fed him  it was a huge  hit  did you hear  those dog  the bounty hunter  things that got  the huge laugh  the other day  that was me  the beep game  was me too  yeah  Sam throwing down  Bronx Johnny  what have you done  for  do the porn review  the sex travel  games  gotta tell you  I'm a big fan  of the porn review  that's gonna be  a tough one  to get over  whatever he asks  to me  I do  that is a good 
[04:19:00]  feature  I gotta give him  that  how he just  bangs the rods  and stuff  one trick pony  compared to  old shaky cam  over here  I noticed that  too sometimes  very fucking shaky  image stabilization  on that camera  I'm trying to jump  from minute to minute  I'm also producing  a radio show  Star Wars Poe  is a little shaky  is that the one  you're getting at  there's not that  much space there  he's coming at me  with a stick  maybe we should 
[04:19:30]  invest in a tripod  I just pissed off  Poe that day too  I didn't know  he was gonna try  and Thad  he's got the  mother thing  some of your  resume please  for everybody  besides holding  a break sign  I remember being  creative on this  show once  that's why I love  Thad  I said in an  article  dry sarcasm  for real  bombs and flubs  I pioneered  the sitcom  mockery  is another  one of my 
[04:20:00]  bits  how's mother  how's mother  I'm constantly  feeding everybody  really awesome lines  he named the  baby bird  yep  yeah  did you really  yeah that was me  it's true  wow  see you got  quit the resume  there  and you leave me  post-its  yes  little reminders  of things to get  to  the brain is not  as well as it  used to be  that's another one  of my uncreative  tasks  that I have  thanks so  I wanted to end  with something  a little better  but that's  yeah that's  another thing I do 
[04:20:30]  and you make sure  I have a sharpie  every morning  alright stop  stop helping  stop helping  stop helping  and uh  it's been rumored  I keep this place  from falling apart  what are you saying  that Steve doesn't  do his job  I don't know  I just thought  that was funny  why is Danny in there  Danny?  he was coming up  with this  I'm just in here  because I have  this really awesome  shit video  I want to show  everybody  oh alright  when do we see that  we all have our roles

[04:25:00]  you need to win  this season  in fantasy football  trash talk  with confidence  and take home  the glory  BodogFantasy.net  Pat's go undefeated  Bill  uh  no  you see who  they have left  though  yeah I know  but not much  of anyone left  someone always ends  up tripping up  they'll rest Brady  at the very end  because undefeated  is nice  but he'll have  some kind of  a small injury  and they won't  want to hurt him  for the playoffs  you can't throw  the whole fucking  playoffs thing  away for a  possible 17-0  they guarantee  they'll sit  who's the backup  quarterback  and I would say 
[04:25:30]  I don't even know  going undefeated  in the regular  season  way more important  than winning  the Super Bowl  wow  that's a bold  statement  because in the end  people go  holy shit  the year the  Pats went  undefeated  they'll keep  saying that  over and over  again  they will  but you know  who won the  Super Bowl  two years ago  quick  Steelers  fuck  hell damn  well Bill's a  fucking machine  though  you can't  no one else  would have  answered that  in this room  though  I said Steelers  shut up  oh my god  that's so funny  Bill like  just blurted it  right up  I said that 
[04:26:00]  when  before he asked  the question  today we were  talking about that  and I was like  fucking Steelers  obviously  oh that's funny  no I'd rather  win the championships  I'll tell you  playing the Colts  again it scares me  man  those guys  were fucking great  Colts should have  won that fucking game  I mean you can't  say  I mean yeah  their defense  well this is  going to be  inside and boring  but their  defense is  ridiculous  no their defense  is insane  that running back  Brady couldn't  figure it out man  and then they  fell apart there  at the end of the  game but  no I thought it  was more like  their offense 
[04:26:30]  no it wasn't  you know what  happened was  right in the beginning  we got sacked  and it took us  to the third  quarter to get  our offense  kind of going  but I'm not  worried about  the offense  our defense  was looking  slow  but you can  see Brady  on the sidelines  like how the  fuck can I  he was like  how do I  figure this  shit out today  he's not  worried about that  he's Tom Brady  he's banging  supermodels  he's got a  baby's mama  out there  he doesn't  give a fuck  of course he is  good point  what do I know  I don't know  shit  I stink  oh come on  don't be fresh  I'm showing some  intelligence  once again 
[04:27:00]  I'm sorry  I think you made  a good point  there  I thought you  brought up  some stuff  let's grab our  phones  you said the  word offense  grabbing my  phone and going  home  here's a runner  up line of the  day  well it was a  chemical stress  test  the nuclear  one  and a pet  scanner  I'd imagine  your stress  test would be  you just  playing with a  butterfly  very good  all right  another runner  up line of  the day  how great 
[04:27:30]  would it be  if they  captured the  sasquatch  and then just  put a chain  around his  neck and  throw him in  the river  and drown  him  with no  scientific  exploration  just no  evidence taken  no nothing  they just  drown it  they drown  it and just  punch it  and kick it  for being so  elusive  well fuck  I'm an animal  bully  I'm tired  of it  you really  are  you're picking  on the  little defenseless  creatures  a point coming  up through  instant feedback  a lot of  people saying  that it would 
[04:28:00]  be cooler  to be undefeated  because they've  already won  their Super  Bowls  yeah but to  go undefeated  the only way  to go undefeated  you gotta win  the Super  Bowl  regular season  that's all  they always  think  you know  what it  sounds great  but a few  years ago  the Mariners  were undefeated  the playoffs  which I mean  is not as good  but they won  like fuck  it wait  four three  seven in a row  or whatever  and then they  got fucked  they lost  and no one  remembers  they had 116  games they won  during the season  no one remembers  they lost the  playoffs  I wonder why  sports talk  doesn't do a  segment on that  it would be 
[04:28:30]  interesting to see  what hardcore  fans think about  that undefeated  season or Super  Bowl what's more  important in the  long run  in the long run  we're talking  like you know  fast forward  10 years  Super Bowl  Super Bowl you  think  even if it's  a team that  wins it a lot  though  you can't never  win it enough  times  who's the  backup quarterback  for the Pats  this guy named  Phillip  I have no idea  I don't know who  he is  could he actually  do something if  Brady gets hurt  well he came and  he threw an  interception for a  fucking touchdown  and then they  brought Brady back 
[04:29:00]  in  then they start  interviewing Bill  Belichick the  Dick Cheney of  head football coaches  he has the best  press conferences  ever  the more people  hate the Patriots  the better it is to  be a fan of them  it's fucking awesome  more people starting  to like the Patriots  around America  I'm a new fan  yeah  fair weather fan  Bodogfancy.net  here's the final  runner up line of  the day  we decide to wait  until it turns  cold to do the  walkover  that's how smart  we are 
[04:29:30]  Anthony has those  red long johns  with the trapdoor  shitter in the  back  holy shit I won  no that was a  runner up  your first runner  up  thought I finally  won  alright Bodogfancy.net  thank you  here is your  line of the day  here comes  the line of the day  the line of the day  the line of the day  the line of the day  Leroy 
[04:30:00]  oh my god  Leonard Nimoy  Leonard Nimoy  yeah  Leonard Nimoy  in search of  he used to go  right  if it was Leroy  Mr. Spock  Hoffman is confused  isn't an undefeated  season and winning  the Super Bowl  one in the same  no  yeah it is  it's considered 
[04:30:30]  like  you're saying  undefeated  in the regular season  alright  but when people say  they're gonna go  undefeated  run the table  I think  you gotta win  the Super Bowl  because  if you go 16-0  and then you lose  the first round  who cares  but they'll say  wow the Pats  were undefeated  in the regular season  who gives a shit  right  seriously  can we do a quick  what  I just wanted to  give quick plugs  for Than  and Sam  tomorrow night  9 o'clock p.m.  and Bill  Bill's in Vegas
