<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a staff member, "Spaz," who expressed his unusual desire for a closer friendship with Opie outside of work.  Spaz recounted calling Opie at home, feeling excluded from Opie's relationships with other staff.  The ensuing conversation, filled with humorous banter, explored the complexities of male friendships and the awkwardness of Spaz's request.  Suggestions ranged from Spaz mowing Opie's lawn to sharing beers. Spaz also revealed he was writing a book.  Comedian Brian Regan was a guest in-studio during this segment, sharing anecdotes about bombing on stage, his large family, and their frugal upbringing.  Listener calls, discussions about replacing damaged studio carpet, and the disastrous stand-up performance of comedian Billy Staples were also woven into this part of the show.  The segment concluded with the reading of a birthday card Spaz had given Opie.

The focus then shifted heavily to Billy Staples’ disastrous Red Bank performance.  The hosts played an audio recording of his set, highlighting the intense heckling and boos from the audience.  Ron from Ron and Fez joined the conversation, expressing concern for Staples, whose substance abuse issues and personal struggles (divorce and living with his mother) were discussed.  Staples’ set, featuring jokes about Red Bank and a poorly received "tampon" joke, was dissected.  The hosts debated whether the poor reception stemmed from Staples' performance or a hostile crowd.  Brian Regan later called in, offering his perspective and agreeing the crowd was exceptionally difficult, though not entirely exonerating Staples. This segment also featured tangents about peanut butter and jelly sandwich news segments, a comparison between Brian Regan and O.J. Simpson's public images, discussions about reality TV shows like "Real World," and the in-studio presence of Mario Cantone and Eddie from Big Brother. Mario Cantone performed impressions of Bette Davis and Liza Minnelli, sharing anecdotes about their lives and personalities.  The segment ended with continued concern over Staples' well-being.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to an in-studio conversation with Mario Cantone.  The discussion ranged from cleanliness and a vulgar invitation from Mario to his experiences on a children's television show he described as an "accident" and "abortion." He discussed infomercials featuring Richard Simmons and Ron Popeil,  and responded to numerous caller questions, including those about his sexuality and future projects.  The conversation touched on his Italian funeral routine, personal experiences with death, chick flicks (including his opinion on *Bridges of Madison County*), and various celebrities like Judy Garland, Ethel Merman, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the struggles of former child stars like Little Johnny Whitaker.  A prolonged, bizarre exchange with recurring caller "Limo Anthony," filled with insults, culminated in a bet involving darts being thrown at Limo Anthony's bare back (with spine protection) in exchange for advertising his business.  The hosts and callers suggested elaborate ways to make the dart-throwing event more humorous. The segment concluded with preparations for the dart-throwing and the arrival of additional guests, Mitch from *Survivor* and Stephen Lynch.

The final segment covered Mike DiNicola's radio experiences, particularly a negative one in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Mitch from *Survivor* (described as a 7-foot tall white guy and former Harlem Globetrotter hopeful) and Anthony from Top Notch Limousines ("douche dyke") were in-studio.  A highly antagonistic interaction with Limo Anthony ensued, focusing on criticisms of his website. This escalated into the aforementioned dart-throwing game, where Opie and others threw darts at Anthony's back, resulting in bleeding and much ribbing.  Anthony received advertising plugs for Top Notch Limousines as a result.  Further banter and discussion about the incident concluded the segment, with Stephen Lynch’s upcoming musical performance mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut the F up!  Wow.  Shut the F up!  Ouch.  Shut the F up!  Ouch.  It's the One Show.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Yeah, Superfly singing along.  I am Superfly, man. 
[00:00:30]  What's lagging it?  What up, brother man?  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  I just walked into the studio.  Yeah.  What is this one all about?  Hold on, hold on.  I'm just a flaming fag.  Ah.  One of those.  Rick always likes pulling the clips of us saying we're fags.  Sort of justifies him being, I guess. 
[00:01:00]  Sean Law.  All right, so I just walked into the studio and Anthony was laughing his ass off with him.  How damn.  What the hell did I miss?  Well, I'll tell you something.  We didn't have our own spaz here for what, two days?  Was it two days?  We were spaz-less and the phones suffered.  And I think everybody was in sort of a weird mood.  Yeah.  It's like when you have to take your beagle to the vet and he's got to stay over.  You go home and there's just something missing. 
[00:01:30]  Something missing.  There's no one crapping on the floor or eating the furniture or, you know, you don't got to feed it.  And it's a pain in the ass of walking and the fleas.  But something's missing in that house, isn't it?  You feel a little empty.  Yeah.  An empty feeling comes upon you.  Yeah.  And then we realized it was spaz.  Spaz is the catalyst of this radio show.  Not two seconds after I walk into this studio, me and Ben are just laughing our balls off at spaz telling us about his couple of days off. 
[00:02:00]  All right.  Can I back up before you tell that story?  Yeah.  So everyone knows by now I'm in a lot of pain.  Yes.  I have a really bad back and I was home last night.  Phone rings and it's spaz.  He calls you at home?  He just calls me at home.  I don't think he would ever call me at home.  And he calls me at home and I'm like, why are you calling me at home?  And he goes, well, I noticed you have a relationship with everyone else on the show.  So I figured I'd call and see what's going on.  That's great.  And I'm just on the couch in pain, you know. 
[00:02:30]  That is fun.  Oh, effing great.  And he goes, I don't want you guys to think I'm really stupid.  But I am.  You know, that spaz we can review, you don't really think I'm stupid, do you?  No.  No, not at all.  No, not until he started talking about his little...  All right, wait, wait.  Get spaz in here.  This is just classic.  You got to hear from his own head.  Spaz.  Hey, spaz, welcome back to the fold. 
[00:03:00]  Lift up that mic.  Thank you.  Is it true you're now calling me at home because you want to have a relationship with me?  Not in a sexual...  Relation.  Not in a sexual sense, but you feel like I have relationships with everyone else that  works on the show.  Hey!  And you kind of felt a little left out.  So you decided, you know, maybe to break the ice, you'd call me at home, right?  I just thought I'd get a little closer to the show.  And spaz, why didn't you give me a call?  Yeah, right.  I don't have your number.  Everyone knows just to leave you alone. 
[00:03:30]  Just leave me alone.  I'm best just left alone.  I show up for the show, do the show, then leave me alone again.  Like in spaz's head, he debates, hmm, should I call up at home?  But when it comes in, it's like, no, he just knows I just will not call him at home ever.  Yeah.  Spaz, you want a little relationship with the show?  What are you doing this weekend?  What am I doing this weekend?  Any plans Saturday?  I'm working...  Any plans maybe Sunday?  No, not at all.  How would you like to mow my lawn? 
[00:04:00]  Huh?  But spaz, you think I have relationships with everyone else on the show?  And you just feel like we haven't been connected lately, or...?  I just want, like, an outside relationship.  Like, just maybe hang out maybe once.  Maybe once.  Hang out?  No, just so you can get to know me outside of work mode.  You mean, like, hang out, have a few beers?  Yeah.  Maybe talk about the colored?  Plip.  I think he's talking more like going to Chuck E. Cheese and going into the ball cage. 
[00:04:30]  No.  I mean, like, he's 23 now.  He's 23.  I think you can handle the ball cage at Chuck E. Cheese.  Now, um...  It's bad.  What would you like to do outside the station?  None of us have lives outside this radio show.  We're boring.  No, just, like, hang out, have a couple of beers, kick back, shoot the breeze.  You know, just talk.  You know, just...  Just talk about things.  What's going on in each other's lives.  Just connect.  God, me and Ovi don't even do that.  We used to do that, but now it's like, huh, hi. 
[00:05:00]  We used to do that.  I don't even live near you anymore.  Well, that's the big problem with that, but I...  So we'd go out and we'd drink beers and...  Yeah.  I wanted to have lunch last weekend, but you were busy.  Yeah.  Oh, that old guy.  I was busy.  Well, I spend most of the week these days in the city, and he wanted me to come all the  way back in the city on a Saturday to have lunch with him.  I'm like, Spaz.  On a Saturday?  Yeah, it's not going to work.  Wow, that's like a day off and everything. 
[00:05:30]  Maybe after the show, start off with a couple of beers at a bar somewhere or something.  Right.  Yeah.  Spaz, give us, like, a scenario.  So you call me up and say, hey, Ope, let's go get some beers.  Yeah, let's go hang out.  Wherever you go to get beers, I would come down.  Hello, Ope?  Yeah.  Greg, if I may call you.  Hi, this is Spaz.  Hi, Kevin.  Oh, okay, Kevin.  Kevin, yeah.  Listen, I'm not doing anything this weekend. 
[00:06:00]  I'm wondering if you want to meet me in Philly for a cheese steak.  Yeah, I'm going to be here anyway.  So, all right, and then what happens?  Like, no, we just talk to see.  You get to know me outside of the show.  You get to know a little bit more about who I am.  Can I mow your lawn?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  All right, I guess we could do that.  Can I tape the whole thing for the radio? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I just thought it would be better if we knew each other a little bit more.  Well, that's probably worse.  Spaz, you best left on the working relationship.  You don't want to get in my pants, do you?  No.  Let's just get it out on the table.  Get to know me.  I need some hot man bread.  That's what girls say, get to know you better.  Guys just, like, hang out.  No, I just want to hang out.  It's not like a big planned thing.  You're just like, hey, what are you doing, man?  Guys just hang out.  If they don't, like, you know, say, I want to get to know you better, you just kind of hang out and then, I don't know. 
[00:07:00]  Get to know how you start off your career, a little bit more.  I think we went through that on the air, didn't we?  Yeah, but it's different off the air.  Yeah, it's not as personal, is it?  Yeah.  Forty hours a week isn't enough?  No, but I mean, outside, it should just kick back.  I spend more time with you than the girl I'm living with.  Than Sandy.  Yeah, but I think you should know me outside of the show.  Really?  And I should know you outside of the show.  Is there something to know?  No, but I mean, wouldn't you want to know who you're working with? 
[00:07:30]  I work at Dell Laboratories.  I'm actually a rocket scientist.  There's something you should know about me.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Matt wants to know if you're gay.  Matt.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Dude, is he gay? 
[00:08:00]  He sounds like my crying girlfriend.  He's unbelievable.  I want to hang out with you.  I want to hang out with you.  What's wrong with you, Spad?  Yeah, guys just, like, all of a sudden, it just happens.  They hang out.  Yeah.  They don't make plans or anything.  Yeah, man.  You finish work, and you say, oh, you want to go grab a beer?  And you go grab a beer.  You don't make plans.  Like, girls make plans.  Yeah, girl chicks make plans.  Right.  Chicks make plans in advance and all that.  Guys, it just happens.  You see out at the bar, oh, Opie, I have to go to the bathroom.  You want to come with me? 
[00:08:30]  Look, all right, Spads, this is how it works, okay?  All right.  I'm staying in the city tonight.  Yes.  We're thinking of maybe just going to get some food after work.  Is that okay?  You want to join us?  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  There you go.  That's what you do.  Okay.  You don't go like, hey, what are you doing Saturday?  You know.  I just like to know what I'm doing.  What are you going to be wearing?  I mean.  I just like to know what I'm doing.  All right.  Well, so would we.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:09:00]  Lucky.  Reggie, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  There's an ulterior motive here.  The ulterior motive is he used to be able to say he just worked with you guys and hook up.  Now he wants to say, oh, I'm personal friends with the opster.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, he's a friend of ours.  I know, but he's using you guys.  No, it's not so much.  The funny thing is, it's, you know, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:09:30]  Exactly.  But obviously Spaz is, I don't know, drawn more to Opie, feeling that he should have this  relationship with Opie.  You're like the third wheel now.  I feel withdrawn from you.  And listen.  Wait, wait, wait.  I've got to let you go, Reggie.  It's getting better in here.  Wait, wait, wait.  One minute.  Wow.  He's very sentimental.  He should be right in Hallmark.  Yeah, okay.  Thank you, Reggie.  You feel what toward Anthony?  Withdrawn.  He feels withdrawn towards me.  I feel like this is blockade because I remember there was one time Anthony was saying on the 
[00:10:00]  air that the only people he talks to were you and then sometimes Reggie can talk just  about the show.  He talks to no one else.  So I figured that he doesn't want to take any calls from anybody else.  So I feel like he's putting that blockade around him towards everybody else.  Okay.  Finally, Spaz is right.  And just doesn't talk to anyone, though.  But believe me, I would love to call him just, you know.  Sorry.  It's just that we only know each other, like, in work mode as co-workers. 
[00:10:30]  I would like to know each other as friends, too.  You know, outside social.  Maybe you could, I don't know, hook me up in one of those hotel rooms you get.  Yeah, we've got to get back into that.  Oh, this is too funny.  So, Spaz, okay, look, we probably are going to get a bite to eat after work.  You can join us.  Okay.  That's how it works.  I'd love to.  You would love to.  I'd love to.  Just don't sit next to me.  Can I come in your book, Spaz?  Sit, like, on the other side of the table. 
[00:11:00]  But how am I supposed to talk to you?  Why do you want to talk to me, man?  Oh, my God.  Even when we go out, we go out all the time after the show and we don't talk.  We just sit there and eat our food and get drunk.  I always end up talking to Earl, but that's no fun.  Get the hint.  You goof on stuff, that's all.  We have, like, a kiddie table when we go out.  It's pretty funny.  We have, like, not saying the main guys, but, like, Rick, Ben, Psycho Mark, me, Ant when  he goes out with us.  And then we have, like, a kiddie table that has, like, Stinky, Black Earl, and Spaz. 
[00:11:30]  The kiddie table.  They're always trying to get into the conversation and just not paying attention.  But they're at the other table and they try to get involved.  It's just not working.  It's like a short bus.  I want to break that barrier.  You want to break that barrier.  Have you been going to, like, counseling or something?  No.  I just feel like we should know each other.  Oh, there's the barrier.  Broke right through it.  Spaz and I are, like, pretty good friends. 
[00:12:00]  We've been hanging for seven years.  We don't need to get to know each other that well.  Yeah, we know each other.  We know each other.  You just, when you hang out with guys, you just know them.  Yeah, but I feel that I, well, I want to work with you guys for a long time, so I feel  like I should get to know you as best as I can.  I love the revelations that come out.  All right.  So, it is so cool.  Well, let's start with a little dinner tonight, okay?  That'll be great.  Okay.  Now it's going to be awkward.  After the show, it's going to, yeah, it's totally, like, awkward now. 
[00:12:30]  Now, Opie's going to be totally paranoid to be left alone.  What's that?  You know why?  I'll tell you something.  Because it started out hanging out, people going out.  You know what this is turning into?  A friggin' date.  It's a date now.  It's turning into a date.  Even though there's, you know, because I don't feel like abusing you.  I know there's nothing gay about this, but now you put me in an awkward situation where  I'm going to feel like, oh, God, now I've got to sit next to him.  Now you've got to talk to him.  We're going to walk in the restaurant.  Now I'm going to have to purposely make sure you sit close to me so I can, like, you know, 
[00:13:00]  make believe I care about what you have to say.  Hey, hey, whoa.  We should be asking you, how's your family?  How's the mood going?  How's my family?  I don't even know.  How is Sandy doing today?  How is Erica doing today?  We should be asking these questions.  We should be asking these questions.  No one cares.  We don't care.  Be quiet, sir.  All right, so now we've got the awkwardness of after the show, we're going to dinner, 
[00:13:30]  and I'll make sure you sit close enough so where I can ask you a couple awkward questions.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Huh?  I know you're not going to touch me, but it's not even that.  He's got to tell me I'm not going to touch you.  Help me.  No, just so you, like, you get to look for this out.  And for the love of God, come out with us tonight.  Okay, terrific.  It'll give us a whole show tomorrow.  This is great.  This is just some great, great, funny stuff.  I'm not gay. 
[00:14:00]  We're not saying you're gay.  Hey!  You're giving us an opportunity to, you know, abuse you and say you're gay for the next half hour,  but it's even weirder the other way.  That you care that much.  I care about you guys as friends.  No one cares about me that much.  I care about you guys as friends and as co-workers, but I only know you as co-workers.  I want to know you guys as friends.  Spaz, you know how you make the line between co-worker and friend?  And this is an honest way to assess it.  Seriously.  If this job ended tomorrow, after like a week of calling and talking to each other about, 
[00:14:30]  oh my God, I can't believe we all got the boot, would we ever hang out again?  Now, you've got to seriously assess this.  Me and Ope, I could honestly see, yes, hanging out.  We'd have to look for a new job.  Yeah.  So, that.  I would hang out with Rick because I'm going out with his sister.  Right.  That's pretty much the only reason there.  Ben, Psycho Mark.  Okay.  So, you know, it would be nice to think that we would actually keep in touch, 
[00:15:00]  but in time, you know how radio is and stuff.  Once you lose, like the people at AAF up in Boston, we don't speak to one of those people.  Go back to my gang at BAB.  Yeah.  We were real tight and I don't see any of them anymore.  So, there's a workplace camaraderie that goes on, but as far as the really getting into  the personal life, you know, my friend, let's say, Joe Curry or Adam Ferrara, they don't  work here with us, but we have a very good friendship that goes over the years.  No matter what happens at my work, I'm still friends with them.  See, I don't know if that's going on yet. 
[00:15:30]  I'm not saying it might not, but the way to make dates like this isn't the way to really  get it going.  Hey!  You know.  If the show broke up tomorrow, I would see Opie.  Ant?  I would see Ant and I would see Rick.  Rick wouldn't see Ant much.  Probably not, unless, of course, we all got another gig together.  And I would definitely not see Ben, Psycho Mark, or you again.  Probably not.  Would you ever talk to me?  Yeah.  It'd be like the phone calls about, oh, my God, you know, how's it going?  You know, got any leads on a job or something like that?  If I saw you in the park, drunk on a park bench, I might say, hey, what's up? 
[00:16:00]  We'd run away.  You know.  I'd talk to you if I bumped into you, but the reality is I probably wouldn't hang out  with you anymore.  Yeah.  It's like a, you know, working relationship where you're very good friends at work.  But that's pretty much, I mean, nothing against you as a person, but that's just how it goes.  There have been some very good people and very good friends at the workplace that we just  don't talk to anyone.  That's the nature of the beast.  We worked in Boston for three years, and we had some pretty close relationships with people 
[00:16:30]  at the station and outside the station.  I hang out with one of them.  That's it.  Yeah.  Not even a phone call?  No.  Every once in a while?  No.  Call me.  You want me to call you?  Call me.  Yeah, but it would be nice because I keep calling you, and I don't, I get one or two calls.  Oh, my God, dude, it sounds like a chick.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I call you.  Dude, are you stalking him?  No.  It's just that I'm trying to get to know him.  Oh.  Oh, me, I'm getting a little jealous of Spock. 
[00:17:00]  Why do I have all the psychopaths after me?  I'm not a psycho.  Why doesn't Anthony have the psychopaths?  I call him if they give me his number.  He's got to do that to mine.  He's an incredibly talented individual.  Latch on to him.  Why doesn't he latch on to me?  I'm not latching on.  It's just that I want to, I feel like I don't know you.  Oh, my God.  I feel like I don't know you.  These are words that come out of a girl's mouth when she's pissed off about how the relationship's gone.  There are people in my family that don't know me. 
[00:17:30]  My girlfriend doesn't know me.  I come home and stare at a TV.  She wants to talk to me.  I swear to God, he has a vagina.  It is so funny.  It's the way a girl talks when the relationship isn't going well.  I don't know you.  I want to get to know what it is.  Why don't you open up to me?  Why don't you call me back?  Are you working on an unauthorized bio or something?  No.  You're working on a book on the Opie and Anthony show?  No, not about the Opie and Anthony show.  You need some background? 
[00:18:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  You're writing on a...  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop, stop.  Did you hear what you just said?  You're working on a book?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Does it have something to do with Ant and I?  No, but it's based on characters in my life.  Holy mother of pearls.  Oh, they're in his head.  Spaz, thank God you're back.  Yeah.  Thank God.  We missed you.  We missed you.  Big homo.  All right.  You're turning into something that is not.  I am not homo.  I'm not...  Spaz, I'm not even going to work that angle. 
[00:18:30]  No.  There's so many other ones.  I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.  It's just...  It's a little weird, though.  I understand that.  Guys just don't get to know other guys, really.  They just have this...  Yeah, you hang out.  This unspoken thing when you hang out with guys.  You nod.  Oh, wow.  That was a great play on the TV.  Give me another beer.  It's not like guys...  Look at the boobs on that girl.  That's guy stuff.  You're thinking of the guys that are like the guys in chick flicks, you know?  That hang out with their friends and discuss things in depth. 
[00:19:00]  Cry on each other's shoulders.  Do you want to like, you know, start calling me on a nightly basis and start gossiping  about everyone and...  No, I don't want to bother you that way.  I mean, like maybe...  Bother you other way.  No, once a week would be nice.  I can't talk to you once a week.  A weekly phone call.  Or once every other week.  Dude, dude, do I call you at home once a week?  Maybe.  Maybe on a Sunday I'll be like, hey, how was your weekend or something, you know?  The most I hear from Ann is maybe once every two weeks.  That's because he withdraws from so many people.  I withdraw myself from people. 
[00:19:30]  Now he's a psychologist.  So the reason is I have my friends.  That's it.  I'm done.  I'm done making them.  The reason is because after, you know, spending a week trying to put on a talk show like we  do, you know, the last thing I want to see is you guys.  Talk and...  Yeah, but you only have seen me for a year and like two or three months.  You've known Anthony for six years, so you've gotten to know Anthony a little bit better  than me.  I want you to know me, too.  I want you to know me. 
[00:20:00]  But, Spaz, I'm going out with Anthony.  I can't...  I don't...  Like, doesn't it sound like he's trying to be like my new girlfriend?  Yes.  I have a girlfriend already, Spaz.  I'm not trying to be anything.  I just want us to be tighter friends.  If it doesn't work out...  It's tighter.  If it doesn't work out with Anthony, I'll consider it.  I mean, what do you want me to say?  He probably sits home.  I can just picture it.  The Opie and Spaz show.  We don't need Anthony. 
[00:20:30]  We don't need him.  If only Opie could see my hidden talent, and Anthony would just disassociate himself  with everybody to the point where Opie gets fed up and he leaves, and then Opie would  say, Spaz, here is this phone call.  Hello, Spaz.  It's Opie.  Anthony left.  And I want you to come on board, and I want to call it the Opie and Spaz...  Wait, no, no.  The Spaz and Opie show. 
[00:21:00]  That's what I want.  He needs me.  Now, Spaz, this is it.  When Ant and I go our separate ways, that's it.  I'm done.  I don't know.  No more radio shows.  Can I use you for reference?  Yeah, you can do that.  There you go.  That's why I'm playing the stock market like a crazy man, just in case.  I'm not saying cut Anthony off altogether.  So he can continue his friendship with Anthony, but you want to be in his life, too. 
[00:21:30]  This is classic.  We have another stalker working five feet from me.  I'm not stalking you.  It's just...  Stinky just came in the studio.  Stinky, call me.  Spaz, were you stalking this radio show before we hired you?  I actually...  I only tuned it in the day before my interview.  Okay, terrific.  Yeah.  Hey!  Woo!  Hey!  Woo!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[00:22:00]  There's some great instant feedback coming in.  Mike from Queens.  Heyo, can me and my girl double date with you and Spaz?  Mark from Jersey.  I think Spaz wants to hang with you guys so that you will stop making fun of him.  I think he thinks that if he becomes your friend, you will find it harder to make fun of him.  Maybe that's it.  No.  You only know me as Spaz.  You don't know me as Kevin.  Okay, Spaz.  So we're going to start with a little dinner tonight, right? 
[00:22:30]  Dinner will be great.  Okay.  You guys want your own table?  Someone better bring the DAT recorder tonight.  We're going to get a table and I'm recording my conversation with you.  I have to.  Sounds going to be awkward.  Oh, Rick, you can't sit there.  Spaz has to sit there.  I know.  I don't want to sit next to you.  I want to sit across so we can play footsie.  Spaz sounds like Carl from Caddyshack.  Yo, just hang out.  You know. 
[00:23:00]  Cannonball.  Cannonball.  Got that going for you.  All right.  People checking in.  Oh, no.  It's the new sensitive Spaz.  Was I okay on the phone last night when you called?  Yeah, it was okay.  It was okay.  What did you expect?  I told you I was in pain.  I shared.  I told you how much pain I was in with my back, right?  There was one part of the conversation which I didn't, I thought was a little bit, you  know, eh, eh.  Oh, no.  And what part was that? 
[00:23:30]  Like the part when I said that I'm not really that dumb.  Um, and then, and then I, you said, okay.  And I thought like you were just passing it off as a meaningless comment.  But meanwhile, it, it, it was not a meaningless comment.  All right.  I, you did say, you just wanted to tell me that you weren't as dumb as everyone thinks.  Yes.  Okay.  But, you know, you just, I thought you just passed it off and it kind of got me, you  know, a little, you know, a little upset, maybe thinking a little.  And so I thought I'd approach you with it today. 
[00:24:00]  Is this like another April Fool's joke?  Yeah, right?  It's gotta be.  You know, it's tough because I love you so much and you don't, you don't love me.  All right.  Uh, Opie.  Yeah.  Uh, this fax just came in from my friend Joe Curry.  Yes.  Plankfoot.  Yeah.  Uh, Ant, let's meet for some wine and cheese.  I think we're drifting apart.  But, so I think, thank you, foot.  I, I think, uh.  Spaz is opening up a whole new realm of sensitivity with friends.  Know how many guys are shaking their heads out there?  When you want to be friends with guys, it just happens.  You don't make plans. 
[00:24:30]  You don't have to get too deep.  You don't call them at home, really.  Unless you say, hey, uh, hey, Opie, Bill's having a cake party Saturday.  Uh, you don't, you want to go.  Great.  You would never go to a cake party with me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Do you have any other friends besides us?  Yes, I do.  And what's his name?  All right, listen.  All right, Spaz, we'll try to be friends.  Okay.  It'll start tonight at dinner.  That'll be cool.  All right. 
[00:25:00]  We won't put you on the, uh, at the kiddie table.  You'll sit at the big boys' table, all right?  Cool.  Tom from Long Island.  Hey, Opie, bring a rubber.  And then Eric from Jersey is, is, uh, quoting me.  It says, Spaz, it's not you, it's me.  Oh, Cranky S from Midtown writes, hey, Opie, will you call me tonight?  I'd ask him, but I feel withdrawn from him.  Yeah.  Everybody's withdrawn. 
[00:25:30]  Are you my pal?  Well, we also have to talk to him about, uh, why we brought him in in the first place.  Obviously, the conversations go awry when he comes in here.  Yeah.  But, uh, he had, his birthday was, uh, when, Monday?  Yesterday.  Yesterday was my birthday.  Spaz, now, if you're calling me at home on your birthday, why wouldn't you share that  with me?  I slipped my mind.  You're going to send me a card?  My birthday's coming up.  I have my birthday's coming up.  I've been written down.  I just don't have your ages. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, you don't want to know our ages.  What, do you want a card with the age on it?  Like, uh, you know, you, today, you're five.  You know one of those?  I keep track of people's ages.  Why?  I don't think they, why?  I like to know how old people are.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I like to say young, because nobody's on the list.  Hallmark, Hallmark doesn't, Hallmark doesn't make cards for our ages.  Yeah.  I think they stop at 13.  At 13.  And, and that's not anything that, like, anyone really asks or needs to know on a card.  You just send a, if you feel like sending a birthday card, like if we knew it was your 
[00:26:30]  birthday, I wouldn't be like, so you're 23.  Like, a little handwritten, hey, 23, you know?  I mean, you just send, happy birthday, Kevin, you know?  I say happy, then the age, birthday, and then I do, like, a little thing.  Like my nana.  That's what my nana would do.  What do you mean you do a little thing?  You're 12 today.  Well, next year, you're a teenager.  What do you mean you do a little thing with the age?  I play on the age, and it depends on the age.  I play, like, a little, like, try to make a little joke, try to, like, he's got jokes. 
[00:27:00]  It's a little joke.  I just try to do something, you know, to make the card live.  I think you watch Martha Stewart before you get here, don't you?  No, I don't.  Try to do something with the card.  Maybe a little play on the age.  Yeah, happy birthday, F-face.  Spaz said earlier that he's working on a book.  Spaz's book title, Men Are From Mars and I Am From Venus.  Let me tell you guys something, man.  You know, this radio show doesn't need writers like all the other top radio shows in this town. 
[00:27:30]  No.  Because we have our listeners.  You guys come up with better stuff than anybody that we would hire to write this crap.  So now, yeah, we were going to talk about his birthday and what he did on his birthday.  The Stone Sea from Jersey.  Hey-o, try a Let's Be Friends Vermont teddy bear.  Another one from the listeners.  You guys are the best.  Or give a bear cast a call and get Anthony the withdrawn bear.  Are you my pal? 
[00:28:00]  How would you like to move my lawn?  Huh?  Okay, terrific.  Hey!  Whoa!  All right, listen.  Come in.  We'll start with tonight.  Someone bring the tape recorder because I'm recording my conversation with Spaz.  Yeah.  You're not going to feel awkward if we have a dad player running.  The tape rolling.  No, but just open.  Talk.  Talk to me.  Open up.  Talk to me.  You never talk to me. 
[00:28:30]  Wait, no.  Oh, no.  Chara.  No.  Chara is in the studio.  I want to defend Spaz.  You want to defend Spaz?  Because he gave me a birthday card last week.  All right, last week was your birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  How old were you or you don't want to tell anyone?  23.  23, okay.  So he has something cute to say about 23?  Yeah, he was very nice.  He got me a nice Christmas card also.  He really knows how to write cards.  He's so nice.  Read the card.  You can read it.  All right.  Can't wait for Spaz's greeting card. 
[00:29:00]  Happy birthday.  Why'd you write question marks after happy?  Because that means my age.  Wait, keep reading.  Yeah, okay.  I have no clue how young you are, but you look 18.  Well, there you go.  Thank you.  I hope that you get all that you wish for on your birthday because you deserve it.  You are a fellow Aries and a friend.  Ooh, very into the astrology thing.  I hope that we will remain friends for more birthdays to come.  Stay wonderful and happy birthday, Kevin. 
[00:29:30]  Wow, handwritten.  That's nice.  Now you, my pal.  Well, no, that is very nice.  Spaz, you're into the signs, right?  Yes, I am.  I'm a Gemini.  Yes, your birthday is in May.  I forgot which day.  I know what day is.  May 23rd.  We make a great couple.  I don't believe in astrology, but I am, what they say about Gemini, about being like a 
[00:30:00]  psychopath and split personality and edgy and all that, that's all me.  I'm a true Aries, too.  Great.  All right, listen.  Are you compatible?  I'm going to try and ram you into, you know.  All right, Ant.  Yeah.  We do have to take a quick break, but.  Yeah, we got to talk about his birthday.  He went out, stayed at a hotel.  He stayed in the city.  You know how sometimes you decide to stay in the city, and he grabbed a hotel here in  the city.  You never guess which one.  All right.  I mean. 
[00:30:30]  It is a good story, because I walked into the studio, like I said, about 40 minutes ago  this started, and these guys were laughing their balls off.  We just went off on a tangent here, but we have to get to the reason why we have Spaz in  the studio.  Yeah.  He spent his birthday in the city, and spent a bloody fortune.  I guess we could say that.  Right?  Yeah.  All right, we'll have the story next.  Stay there.  Thanks.  You're checking out the lame version of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027. 
[00:31:00]  Outside of New York City.  877.  Nah, that's another number.  866.  How's that one?  Okay, 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  We're still waiting for the Billy Staples tape.  People think we're going to make it the 520 bit.  No.  No, no.  Believe me.  We need it now.  Rick, we go, Rick, how much longer?  He goes, we're almost there.  What does that mean?  Almost there.  That doesn't help us.  We need it now.  I was under the impression we'd come in, and the show would write itself today. 
[00:31:30]  Brian Regan's here.  Hey, is Brian here?  He sure is.  Oh, no.  Hey, has he been briefed?  I was reading the paper, and...  Oh, okay.  Get him in here.  Oh, okay, okay.  We could use him right away.  I can't even...  Oh, okay.  Hey, Brian.  Brian, how are you?  How you doing, Brian?  What's going on, Brian?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What's up?  Just hanging out. 
[00:32:00]  Hanging out.  No problem.  That's okay.  I'm just running at full speed.  I'm just hanging out, man.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, you can take a seat there.  At least you were brave enough to come in today.  Hey, man.  It's my pleasure.  Anthony Michael Hall decided there's better places to be today.  No, no.  I want to be here.  I want to be here where the action is, where the craziness comes from.  Anthony Michael Hall got that stomach wink-wink flow all the time.  Some kind of stomach thing.  He probably realized the network his show is on and threw up. 
[00:32:30]  That's the sci-fi channel.  I was kind of digging the show.  The Dead Zone, it's like Anthony Michael Hall plays Christopher Walken's part, and they  made it into a series.  And it's pretty good.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted to just joke on it and goof on it, but I watched it, and it was pretty good.  And now I hate saying that because for some reason he's not here today.  I just wish he would have came up with a better excuse.  Belly ache.  I got a tummy ache.  The one I used to use in school. 
[00:33:00]  I used to use that one all the time.  I got a stomach ache.  You know what I told the gym teacher once?  Because I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to have these.  You ever get stomach pains because of gas?  Oh, yeah.  And my mother said, oh.  A little gas pocket.  My mother would be like, oh, you're cramping up.  You're cramping up because of that.  I went to the gym teacher and said, I can't participate today.  I have cramps.  And he looked at me. 
[00:33:30]  He started laughing.  He goes, why?  I said, I have cramps.  He goes, you can't have cramps.  He goes, only girls have cramps.  And I'm feeling this pain from the gas.  I go, no, I have cramps.  I was having my period.  And I didn't even know it.  It was all right in the cotton pony.  I used to get like this sharp, intense pain in the right side of my rib cage.  It lasted for about, I mean, it was over a three-year period.  Like every two or three months, it would just. 
[00:34:00]  It would just come out and it would kill.  I would literally like fall on the floor.  Wasn't that running pain that you'd get?  It was worse than that.  It was just like the sharpest pain I had ever experienced.  It was just like, ah.  And I would like fall on the floor.  And my parents would go, well, it's growing pains.  Don't worry about it.  I mean, how vague of a diagnosis is growing pains?  I can't even stand up.  Don't worry about it.  It's growing pains.  You're growing.  That's what happens when you grow.  You get pains. 
[00:34:30]  Ah!  Oh, I recognize that hideous scream.  Those are growing pain screams.  Your rib is growing into your lung right now at an accelerated rate.  Oh, my gosh.  You're bleeding from the mouth.  It's growing pain.  I never got it, you know, officially diagnosed.  And then they went, you know, they only lasted like three years.  I only had to endure it for over like a two or three-year period.  Three years?  And you never went to the doctor?  No.  Because it was just growing pain.  Well, it was like every three or four months.  It was just, I'd just be sitting there eating fish sticks or something. 
[00:35:00]  And then, you know, and then it would just kill me.  And it would last about a minute.  And then it would go away for another three months.  How many kids did your parents have?  A lot.  Eight.  Eight.  Okay.  That explains it.  Yeah.  You can't be taking every one of these kids to the doctor with every pain.  So it's like, let Brian roll around in agony on the floor.  And we'll just tell him it's growing pain.  I got dinner to make for the other seven.  Yeah.  If we lose one, I'll barely even notice.  Get out of the kitchen with your growing pains. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I'm trying to work here.  I'm trying to make fish sticks.  It's like an army mess line.  Get out of the way.  You had to eat the fish sticks, too, huh?  Yeah.  Friday.  Friday was fish sticks?  No.  Families with a lot of kids, fish sticks.  What about margarine and sugar sandwiches?  Oh, I had that, too.  Yeah.  We've talked about that on the show.  Margarine and sugar sandwiches.  We were doing that, though.  Really?  I was so poor.  Let me tell you a little bit about how poor I was.  My grandma convinced us that that's a nutritious lunch. 
[00:36:00]  Not even butter.  Margarine.  Margarine.  She would lay out the Wonder Breads and then lop it with the margarine and then pour the  sugar on each individual sandwich.  Man.  That was lunch.  Man, that's nice.  That is a true story, yes.  Because you were poor.  Let's go to Kim.  Kim has a question for Brian Regan.  Yes, Kim?  Hi, Ryan.  Hi, Kim.  I saw you at Bananas a couple weeks ago.  Okay.  And Saturday morning, I opened up my cabinet and decided to make Pop-Tart.  No, no, no.  Oh, jeez.  Now, I found out my brand new toaster oven has a Pop-Tart setting. 
[00:36:30]  Are you serious?  I swear to God, it's a Toastmaster and it has a Pop-Tart setting.  It says Pop-Tart on it?  It says Pop-Tart in that little red funky Pop-Tart logo.  Or does it say Toaster Pastry?  Yeah, right.  Because, you know, they've got to use the generic term unless it's used by it.  Some companies are in cahoots, though, you know?  Absolutely.  It's like they'll have the Pop-Tart setting on it or a washing machine that'll say, put  Tide here.  And they're like, they're in cahoots with each other. 
[00:37:00]  But if it just says detergent or toaster pastry, that's a whole other animal.  You wonder, like, if they had this big giant meeting, you know, with the Pop-Tart CEOs  and the toaster oven head honchos, hey, how about we work together and instead of going  with the generic toaster pastry term, we write Pop-Tarts on there, we corner the market,  we start making millions.  And you could put on the instructions, put into Proctor Silex toaster oven. 
[00:37:30]  We rule the toaster pastry and toaster oven world.  That's right.  Yeah, because they've got to get it on the other end.  Take, Brian.  Yeah, that's right.  I don't know anything about business.  Why are they going to put the Pop-Tart button on there if they're not getting a little kickback  from the Pop-Tart people?  That's not a quid pro quo.  Right.  That's just quid.  Or something.  Hey, Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, dumb.  Hey, dumber.  Hey, what's up?  Thank you.  How you doing, little Jimmy?  Hello, sir. 
[00:38:00]  Brian, I was wondering if you like the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Yeah.  Yes, I...  We're heading down this road already?  You can see this happens a little bit later.  Later.  You know, you're doing a little bit of conversation.  Don't mess it around here, guys.  I get right into it.  The listeners know we're struggling today.  Sit right there.  Like, we can't wait for Opie and Anthony to get to this.  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm going to be talking about all the controversial stuff.  Yeah.  I'm coming after peanut butter and jelly.  I'm coming after Pop-Tarts.  I'm coming after T-shirts.  Did anyone ever tell you you shouldn't talk about peanut butter and jelly because you 
[00:38:30]  might get in trouble if you do?  Perhaps you should steer away and move on to something else.  No one ever comes to side stage as you're doing it and makes that slashing of the throat  with their finger motion.  This could be a problem.  This could be a problem if this conversation continues kind of thing.  Imagine like some...  You've never been on the phone with lawyers talking about peanut butter and jelly and  how we should not discuss it because they're still making the sandwich? 
[00:39:00]  Okay.  Noted.  Avoid topic.  Noted.  Because I know when we talk about peanut butter and jelly, we go into those peanut butter  and jelly meetings and it gets really ugly.  And they're not pretty.  And we had a whole show planned around talking about peanut butter and jelly.  And you know something?  At the last minute, they said, we can't talk about peanut butter and jelly.  The whole thing?  The whole topic was out the window? 
[00:39:30]  Out the window.  We can't even talk about how maybe if they were doing a news special on peanut butter and  jelly, how they presented peanut butter and jelly.  It is such an off-limits topic.  PB&Js.  So now we've got to sit and wonder.  Hey, you know what I was wondering about that topic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes they put peanut butter and jelly in the same jar.  Have you noticed that?  Yeah.  That is like...  That's nuts. 
[00:40:00]  Really.  And I don't know if I'm going into like some territory where your lawyers are going to  have to get in here or not.  But is there a point to that?  I mean, I'm lazy, but I want to meet the guy who needs that.  You know, I could go for a sandwich, but I'm not going to open two jars.  I can't be opening and closing all kinds of jars, cleaning, who knows how many knives.  You know, if you're that hungry, just, you know, or lazy, put some croutons in there. 
[00:40:30]  You get the whole sandwich on one spoon.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  I'm going to have a second one.  Oh, scrumptious!  That's what's the first!  Or sometimes you might want to...  You don't want to clean the spoon, so you put it all in a squeeze bottle.  Munch and no clean-up!  Can life get better?  I submit that it cannot.  Come after me, lawyers! 
[00:41:00]  You're on the edge.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Hey, Dan, what's up today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm going to be taking a car trip with my family pretty soon.  I was wondering, Brian, do you have any stories about that?  Yeah, as a matter of fact...  You do?  Yeah, my family, we got together, and my parents gave us some peanut butter and jelly in the  same jar in the back of the car.  No, no, no.  That never happened.  No, no, no.  Well, we'll get into that in a moment.  Of course.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:41:30]  Right now, we have to get Pete Johnson, our engineer, because my mic just fell.  I hope this isn't a sign.  It just might be.  Yeah.  Oh, that's broken.  It was written.  Oh, Rick, you can't fix it.  Your people just use duct tape.  I've seen your cars.  I broke it.  You broke it.  Oh, that fitting is broke.  That little piece.  I'll say.  Oh, this mic is effed.  Well, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  I'll leave it hanging there for a moment. 
[00:42:00]  We have the Billy Staples audio.  It's ready to go.  It's right to my left.  We're going to play it next, okay?  And Brian Regan's going to help us out with that.  You have it?  Yeah, finally.  Oh, great, because Brian Regan, obviously, a very popular stand-up comic.  And I want to ask you, have you ever bombed?  Yes.  You have?  Yes.  I bombed.  It was the second show Friday in 1987.  It was horrible.  You remember it.  You've never bombed, have you?  What are we talking about?  I bombed last night.  What are you talking about? 
[00:42:30]  No way.  You bomb all the time.  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, is that relative, though?  You're like, yeah, I bombed.  Like there was one person in the back that was just kind of...  No.  They weren't crying with laughter.  I mean, you get to where you can kind of fake it, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  But you know.  You know in your heart you're bombing, you know?  Really?  You know, but usually like in a comedy club environment, it's pretty cool.  But every once in a while, you'll get in a situation where...  I can't see you bombing.  Ah, well...  I can't see...  Hey, I'm bombing! 
[00:43:00]  Hey, I'm bombing!  That happens sometimes, man.  No?  It's horrible.  Oh, Pete Johnson.  You know, I'll tell you, I was doing a corporate show, and I literally...  I'm Pete.  Brian Regan's talking.  That's all right.  I was doing a corporate show, and I literally heard...  I did a joke.  It got no laughs, and it was in the Pacific Northwest.  It was like off an island off of Seattle.  Joke got nothing.  I literally heard crickets outside.  Like...  Oh, out of the woods.  And I just started laughing, you know, because I was like, oh, man, you know, I've heard about hearing crickets. 
[00:43:30]  I've never actually, actually heard the crickets.  And then the audience laughed, because they could hear the crickets, too, and they sort of were on my side for, like, the next few moments.  Until the next joke.  Where'd you get a corporate gig at Microsoft?  That's pretty nice.  Yeah, that was...  It was Microsoft?  Yeah.  Some division of Microsoft or some damn thing.  That's all that's going on out there.  Where...  Why else are they...  What corporate...  What other corporation?  Hey, we're Beavers, and we love Brian Regan out on this little island off in the Pacific Northwest. 
[00:44:00]  It's Microsoft or Beavers.  I don't keep it vague.  It's Arbor.  I don't know why I don't want to say the company name.  I don't want to say it, but it's on a small island.  It's Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies.  It has a volcano.  I don't want to say Seattle in the Pacific Northwest.  Pacific Northwest.  A small island in the Pacific Northwest.  I'm plotting with maps.  I got charts over here to try to figure out where Brian was.  Where in the world is Brian Regan? 
[00:44:30]  All right.  And when we get back, we got the Billy Staples audio.  Finally.  Billy bombed really bad, and we'll get Brian's opinion on the whole thing.  I'm sure he did good, man.  He was warming up.  I'm sure he did fine.  Even you cannot talk this thing nice.  Brian, it's been a soap opera for the last two weeks.  The guy has not come back to work since.  He has left the state.  He's left the state.  He's left the signal.  He's embarrassed to come back to the station.  He has left the broadcast area of this station, so he won't inadvertently hear people making 
[00:45:00]  fun of him.  Maybe he's in the Pacific Northwest.  Some small island.  Maybe he's doing gigs.  Some island doing gigs.  Picture Brian swimming up in a scuba suit.  Da-na-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-na-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  It's the only way to get there.  Cue.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Brian Regan in studio.  Oh, yeah.  Very funny guy.  We love Brian Regan. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  He has decided to stay, Anthony.  That's very nice of him.  Hey, man.  Mighty white of him.  My pleasure.  Sorry, O.P.  I was distracted reading.  Just reading things that are being printed out from various newspapers.  Did you see Pete Johnson come running in like an indie pit man and fix my mic?  Yes.  That guy is a professional, and we're all going to miss him when he retires in 11 months or  whatever the hell it is.  Ten and a half months. 
[00:46:00]  Ten and a half months.  He's counting the days now.  He's counting the days.  He just 40, how many years?  44, he said.  44 years of working at this station, and it just being the smoothest sailing ever.  All he had to hear was, hey, my microphone's a little tinny.  Okay, Scott, so I'll fix it.  Nothing like that.  Now there's staining of carpets by couples.  He replaced the carpet yesterday.  He replaced the square of carpet.  He should have had to do that. 
[00:46:30]  That we had.  I know.  Why did he have to do it?  He just decided he didn't want to look at it anymore.  You notice the brand new carpet in here, Brian?  Yeah, it's very nice.  Nice, isn't it?  It is very nice.  Is there one tile of carpet that's a little cleaner than the rest?  No, he replaced the whole thing.  Oh, he did?  He took the one out and put the whole new one down.  It's kind of hard to just cut a square out.  Well, these are indeed two foot by two foot squares.  Oh, they are.  Wow.  Because underneath this is some hatch door system that is akin to the old Ronan Martin laughing. 
[00:47:00]  The hatches that Goldie Hawn would pop up out of and tell a joke.  Look, there's hatches where you can get down there and get the wires that are running all of you.  This is a floating studio.  Yeah.  To christen the new rug, Brian.  Sure.  You get a new rug, you've got to do something like that.  And you have to look at it and enjoy it.  There was stuff that remained after they left, let's just say.  Yeah.  Someone dropped a cornflake on the rug.  Yeah, we taped off the area.  And then somebody put a couple of napkins over the fence. 
[00:47:30]  And it sat there for a day and a half until Pete Johnson, sick of looking at it, put a new piece of carpeting down.  He is quite a professional, but he's never had to deal with stuff that he has to deal with with this show.  Correct.  Good for him.  All right, finally, Anthony, the Billy Staples audio that everyone's been waiting for.  Once again, Jim Norton invited Billy Staples to warm him up, what, two weeks ago at Red Bank? 
[00:48:00]  Wasn't it at Billy's prompting, though?  Didn't Billy say?  Not begging, but he brought it up first.  Yeah, kind of like joking, because Ron and Fred are going to help promo the gig.  So he's like, hey, maybe you can put me on it.  I'm like, yeah, you know what?  Yeah, okay.  Cool.  And so I was happy to have him.  With that smile all the time?  Yeah, maybe you can put me on.  All right.  Okay.  And he hasn't been seen since.  Yeah.  He finally called Ron and Fez last night.  Oh, he wasn't a happy Billy.  Yeah, hi, how you doing?  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  It was, well, I don't know what to do.  I'm very depressed.  I bombed.  I had a horrible time.  And as my life, he goes, he goes, Ron, my life isn't falling apart.  My life fell apart.  And he goes, the only thing I have left is this dream of being on the stage and being  a comic.  And I've been doing stand-up for nine years, and I cannot now get back on the stage.  He goes, how do you recover from something like this? 
[00:49:00]  Just get back on.  I know.  He was crying.  It was disgusting.  I mean, I understand he's hurt, but you've got to go back on.  Like a horse.  And just going, oh, stop it already.  Stop your whining.  Exactly, like a horse.  If you follow the horse, you run after the horse, you punch it, and you get back on.  Right.  Right.  Or if a horse gags you, you've got to just spit it out and keep going.  If a horse or a mule kicks you in the face, you kick it back.  Right.  Here was Ron's reaction, though, to Billy crying last night. 
[00:49:30]  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  He smacked him in the face.  It was great.  But I've got to say, it's not Billy's fault.  Tom left.  He thinks they all booed because of his act.  He never got a chance, Brian, to do his act.  It was that, the crowd was that hostile.  Maybe it sounded like boo, but it was Billy Staples.  Oh, no.  Billy Staples.  There was an a-hole chant.  Oh.  There was a, how do you?  No, no, no. 
[00:50:00]  That's Staples.  Staples.  See?  You've got to look at it like riding a bike.  You know, if a girl gets off, you smell the seat while she runs into the store.  There, see?  You've got to apply a philosophy like that.  I don't think there's a positive spin on get off the stage, you fat.  It's really not.  Now, we've got the audio.  Billy comes in crystal clear.  You can't really hear the crowd.  Well, we boosted it a little bit, right, Rick?  We did so much.  We were hard at work.  We double layered it.  We tried to boost the crowd and bring up Billy and kind of match it as best we could. 
[00:50:30]  There's going to be a bit of a hiss, but that's just the, that's just the hiss from the VCR.  I hate the hiss.  I hate the hiss.  God forbid that when they record it and you're paying to have it recorded from the actual venue  that it should sound properly.  Who would want the audience mic for a live recording?  And part of the problem, too, is that when he starts screaming into the mic, it freaks the mic out  Regardless if you could hear the crowd or not, the most important thing, listen to the desperation in his voice.  Listen to how distracted he is and how he cannot even get words out because he is so preoccupied with the crowd heckling him. 
[00:51:00]  Well, but first, on the phone, we've got Ron from Ron and Feds.  Ron.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Ron.  Ron.  Ron.  Yeah.  You'll still hang out with us, right?  Kind of.  Kind of.  Ken and I are both waiting to see what the lawyers say.  Right.  And then we'll have an opinion.  Very good.  Very good strategy.  We're using that one.  You know, I said to Ken and Jeremy, geez, what do you think of this? 
[00:51:30]  Well, that's it, huh?  Maybe it's time for Ron and Feds to be on three shifts a day.  Just turned into the Ron and Feds station at this point.  I'm like, hey, I noticed those replays are trending up.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's great.  Ron, we finally got the audio.  Billy Staples, of course, we're going to leave it for you guys tonight.  I don't even know if it should be played.  Why?  You know what kind of shape he's in.  He's suicidal. 
[00:52:00]  Let me tell you something.  I listened to your show when you talked to Billy on the phone.  I wanted to reach through and smack him.  I wanted to smack him in the face.  He was just the most whining.  Yeah, he's pathetic.  He really is.  When he said, my life isn't falling apart, my life fell apart.  Hey, look at that.  They're talking about peanut butter and jelly on Channel 2.  Oh, where is that?  Oh, look at that.  Hold on there, Ron.  Now there's...  Why are the Rockettes there? 
[00:52:30]  Well, it's a coming attraction.  Oh, it's what they call a teaser.  They're teasing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich story on Channel 2, right?  Sorry, Ron.  Yeah.  Hey, if you missed that one, another one's coming on in five.  They've been on all day.  A lot of interest in peanut butter and jelly.  Yeah, it really is.  Talk about going the other extreme.  So you bring me in to do some Pop-Tart jokes.  Right, sure, you bring Regan in, it's like the sunlight after a bad storm. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  Regan is like when O.J. was hanging around with Rosie Greer the next day.  Yeah.  And everybody's like, hey, Rosie Greer's great.  So therefore, by association...  Yeah, Brian's such a nice guy.  I never even heard him use a curse word on stage.  No, he doesn't.  That's right.  He's a good boy.  Ron, at one point today, it was only raining over this building. 
[00:53:30]  No joke.  That was a little odd.  A little strange.  Ah, you never know.  All right, so why don't we get to the audio of Billy Staples, okay?  You know, but also let people know that don't know Billy, he's already been through five rehabs.  Yeah, you got a little more of a background on what his destroyed life is a little more about.  He's been through five rehabs, and when we were talking to him last night, he's slurring.  So, the newest chip is out the window, I'm sure.  Oh, and you asked him if he was doing any drinking, you promised you won't drink, and he said, I can't promise anything. 
[00:54:00]  What does it matter?  What does it matter?  What does it matter?  He had that whole attitude of just, oh, me, poor me, I'm just going to cash it in.  And, you know, here's the thing, too.  His second marriage broke up, so he moved home with his mom, and he's 44 years old, and he's sleeping in the same room as he did in high school.  So, he's waking up in a single bed now, and he's looking up at these old, faded, Harry Bradshaw and Peter Frampton posters that he had there in the 70s. 
[00:54:30]  This should have been part of his intro.  Yeah, I see.  This would have set the plate nice for him.  You know, he's a lovable guy, but, you know, they're not called lovable clubs.  They're really not.  You know, you have to have comedy.  He's got to realize he has a good gig with your show, and he's being way too hard on himself.  Sure, he's the phone guy.  He's doing great. 
[00:55:00]  It's an entry-level position.  He's at midlife.  Dude, are you just hoping that he kills himself on your show live?  This is before the tape, please.  That's harsh.  But, I mean, so he's going through a lot.  Yeah.  And I love how everyone is saying, now, when you listen to this tape, everyone says,  oh, you know something?  You could be the funniest comic in the world and come out there, and they would have booed anyway.  And everyone goes, yeah, yeah.  But he's not. 
[00:55:30]  He's not the funniest comic, no.  No.  I mean, you know.  I don't know.  I've never seen what he does.  I can't say he is or is.  I honestly don't know.  Where were you?  Where were you when these hijinks and shenanigans were going on?  I was watching it from the back.  What were you saying?  What were you and Voss saying to each other?  Come on.  Are you laughing?  How do you laugh?  And I like Billy.  When you're watching one of your friends take it in the face, you have to enjoy it.  You think I'm rooting for other comics?  I want them all to go down in flames.  Yeah, that's true.  You know what he would do.  You like to watch other comics, Bob, because it makes you feel better about yourself. 
[00:56:00]  Even you, Brian Regan?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Wow.  It's the most controversial thing I've ever heard you say.  Well, Brian's going to be commenting about Billy Staples here.  Let me rethink this.  Let me take this back.  All right, Brian, you want to stay on the phone for the...  Oh, man.  All right, let's start today.  All right.  It's a pleasure bringing up our next act.  You're going to love this guy.  He's a good friend of mine. 
[00:56:30]  He's been on Comedy Central.  He's been on MTV.  He's a regular Rod and Fez.  Billy Staples, a big hit.  What the f*** we expected, Fabio?  All right, so he starts out...  Now, they seem to be applauding, though, when he came out.  I heard, like, applause, and then I heard a slow turn to boo. 
[00:57:00]  There's a little low boo rumbling.  Yeah, a little low boo, but there was, like, yay.  I think William didn't take charge immediately.  You can't...  I told you that Bill Maher story in Phoenix.  Open for dice.  You can't sometimes stand there and just go, all right.  If you hear them applauding, then this low murmur of booze, you've got to get right to the mic and start rapping.  This is not the L.A. Improv on a Saturday evening. 
[00:57:30]  I mean, these are a bunch of drunken pigs.  You know, I'm not on the road anymore.  Is the Fabio stuff still current for us?  I've been opening with it, but I get to it quicker.  Yeah.  The Fabio.  That might have been a problem right off the bat.  What are you expecting, Rock Hudson?  I mean, I look like Frankie Lyman.  But, you know, it's not a bad joke.  It just didn't fly.  Yeah.  He attacked right away, though.  Yeah.  He attacked the crowd right away. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, implying they were expecting something.  All right, back to the tape.  Jesus Christ, that's why I'm at f***ing radio.  Uh-oh.  Oh, the f***ing dog yelling at me.  I'm sure how f***ing good you look over there.  I think he got a good applause there.  It seemed like he struck back at one of the hecklers.  Unfortunately, there were about 499 more.  And you shouldn't agree with them.  You know, what the heck? 
[00:58:30]  What do you think I'm in radio for?  Of course, look at me.  You can trip, you can rip yourself, but you've got to pow!  You smack the guy in the face and then trash yourself.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't give in.  Like, you know, I'm not knocking him.  He hasn't been on stage much because he's doing radio.  Like, boo.  Because they were yelling.  What you couldn't hear was, you fat F.  He was wearing the big orange shirt, so people were yelling, you look like an effing pumpkin.  And they were really being brutal.  So then he did a little of that self-deprecating humor.  Well, what does Brian think so far?  You know, he got heckled. 
[00:59:00]  He came back.  You know, he's trying to get control.  Well, you know, he's doing his thing.  Right?  You are good.  They send you to the Middle East.  Hey, why don't you Jews get along with the Palestinians?  Actually, we should send them down the hall.  Palestinian even starts with pal.  So why don't you just be their pal?  And Israel starts with is.  Pal is.  We could is be pal.  Is be our pal.  All right.  Back to Billy.  There it is. 
[00:59:30]  Wow.  You're right there.  Hey, you guys got paintball guns.  Thank you.  Then I'm staying up here.  Hey, guys, welcome.  Come on, seriously.  Welcome to Red Bank.  A town that's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons on the shore.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.  It sounded like they were starting to laugh and then you guys cut it.  That was a laugh.  I like the local stuff. 
[01:00:00]  He's doing a lot of local stuff.  Yeah.  He's relating.  Some local color.  He, uh, I like, that was the first of the seriously.  That was the first of the seriously.  When he says seriously, he's pleading, oh, please let me just start my act.  All kidding aside, guys.  Yeah, all kidding.  All right.  I know you're heckling and yelling and we've been having a good time.  Yeah.  But now we got to get down to brass tacks.  I'm down with that jockey.  Settle down.  Settle down.  Let's go back. 
[01:00:30]  Brian thinks he might have got a laugh.  Well, it sounded like they were starting to laugh at the Joker.  All right.  Hey, guys, welcome.  Come on.  Seriously, welcome to Red Bank, a town that's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons  on the shore.  A little bit.  And a huge, huge sock.  Now, here we go.  But that's one guy yelling that while the rest is laughing.  I'm going to hear two laughs and one really loud, you suck.  I'm going to be brutally honest right here now.  I'm going to be brutally honest.  Here's what happened.  He says that people were yelling right when he came out. 
[01:01:00]  He's right.  They were.  That was his chance right there.  You heard when he goes, welcome to Red Bank.  Seriously, welcome to Red Bank.  There was not a peep.  There wasn't a peep.  That was his shot now to win the audience over with a huge opener.  It absolutely was.  If we could again.  Okay.  Perhaps.  All right.  They shut up for him when he said seriously.  Maybe the choice of tampon didn't work out for him.  Yeah, maybe not.  Maybe tampon him might have helped a little bit.  I think Brian enjoys a bloody tampon joker once in a while, right? 
[01:01:30]  You never know.  Everyone has their different style.  Yeah.  He's got a style.  You pull that out in the third set, right?  Yeah, that's late night stuff.  Yeah.  That's right.  Bill's his material.  All right.  You want to hear this again?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Hey, guys.  Welcome.  Come on.  Seriously.  Welcome to Red Bank.  A town that's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons on the shore.  It's got a laugh, too.  It's got a laugh.  That's what I'm saying.  It's my laugh.  That's a lot of heckling.  All right. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  We heard you, you stupid f***.  Not really.  That actually got a nice laugh.  There was one really loud heckler, but you got to smash that guy really hard.  That's the thing.  He's got enough of a base where if he can shut the one guy down.  Right.  He had it right there.  That was his moment.  He got a little bit of a laugh.  He should have smacked the guy in the face and then, boom, right again with some strong stuff.  I think he was thinking more of a shotgun blast at the audience than that laser comeback line. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, he's got it.  He was going to take everybody down.  A shotgun blast.  It's kind of hard to get them all back if you shut them all down.  But a guy like that, man, you got to hit him.  He's like, hey, why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?  Hey, yeah, you.  That's the crowd laughing.  A lot of people checking in that were there, Anthony, saying that the tape is not doing the performance justice.  Everyone is saying people were screaming and yelling and heckling the whole time that you could barely even hear him.  Well, the fact that Marlee Maitland did the audio on this, I would like to smash this company. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, the crowd wasn't mic'd, obviously.  Why would you have a live performance?  Who needs the crowd?  So just keep that in mind.  I mean, they were just riding him really hard.  It's a lot louder than it sounds in this tape.  So when it's silent, there were people screaming.  Yeah.  Imagine what it sounded like in his head.  All the demons screaming at him.  Booze, pills, and the audience.  He's adding to the chorus.  In his defense, he had that stomach stapling thing, and it didn't take. 
[01:03:30]  I mean, that's rough to deal with.  They don't take or not take?  Well, he's gained weight since his stomach has been stapled.  He's popped a few staples.  How do you break that to a patient?  The stapling didn't take.  Sorry, your stapling didn't quite take.  These might just be growing pains.  That's a callback.  Yeah, go on, yeah.  Billy just didn't hit them hard enough, man.  Maybe they made the staples out of pure butter.  Is that it?  That ties in with the Fabio. 
[01:04:00]  I can't believe it's not butter.  This is the kind of stuff he needs.  If a guy heckles you like that, you've got to say to the crowd,  hey, wouldn't you like him to shut the heck up?  You know, I'll clap and get on your side.  Back to the tape.  All right.  Some of you made me say to yourselves,  why the f*** you got a name like Staples?  Because I had that staples surgery, right?  The stomach stapling?  Doing a great job, huh?  You guys are so f***ing kind. 
[01:04:30]  Come on.  Shut the f*** up and let me do it to you.  Oh, that's right.  Even Brian.  Even Brian.  That's what got Brian.  That's really right.  That's a hard moment.  That's a hard moment there.  That's a hard moment.  Let me do the act.  Oh, my God.  That was so bad.  You know the feeling, but that's the worst thing you could say.  They're not going to just sit there and go,  oh, he makes a good point.  Okay.  That's the Jake LaMotta moment.  Don't bother me, pal. 
[01:05:00]  I'm trying to do my routine.  Don't bother me, pal.  It's more like he thought he was going to be the prom queen  and the blood started pouring down.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  You see Brian's face?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Brian was pained to listen to that.  Brian made the same face I saw Ken Stevens make eight times today  at different phone calls.  Okay.  Let's hear more of the Billy Staples.  Hey, boss ain't coming back, you b***h. 
[01:05:30]  He's already halfway on the b***h turnpike getting out of here.  All right, listen up.  Seriously, listen to me for a second.  What do you guys?  You guys listen to ONA, of course.  When I was on ONA, I had a colonoscopy done on the air. 
[01:06:00]  Any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  Any of you guys had a colonoscopy?  How about can any of you guys spell it?  This is not men that you're talking to.  They're retard, drunken lunatics.  Brian, not smart to ask the audience questions?  No.  Not in that particular situation.  Not when they're that hostile.  Yeah.  And the question that he asked,  hey, anyone colonoscopy?  Seriously, guys, 17% across the board, tax or what? 
[01:06:30]  All right, well, this is great.  He takes out the Q&A now.  We get rid of the Q&A.  This is helpful.  This is working out.  It really is.  That was another very uncomfortable moment.  This just in.  Looks like Channel 5 also likes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Oh, boy.  They are covering it.  All right.  Back to that line, Anthony.  Well, you guys, you guys listen to ONA, of course.  When I was on ONA, I had a colonoscopy done on the air. 
[01:07:00]  Any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Yelling and screaming, whip him out.  And being kind of a large man, he decided to lift his shirt up.  He lifted his shirt.  His man boobs.  And he got a good reaction.  That's not a ovation.  See?  See?  Full score. 
[01:07:30]  Hey, I'll wait all night for you guys.  Get out.  Oh, go ahead.  And then, seriously, any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He went back.  Follow-up.  He went back.  He went back to the colonoscopy.  He's on it.  He got a little off track with the whip him out.  And then, wham, back to the colonoscopy.  Back to the killer stuff.  Sure.  Back to the killer stuff. 
[01:08:00]  This is his stuff.  He's got gold.  He's got a piece of gold to bring out there for him.  I can't wait now to hear the punchline.  Oh, no.  Let's give a little listen.  And you guys, oh, I'm the only one who fell for this.  He fell for it.  He fell for it.  You were diagnosed.  He fell for it.  You're eating whole hams for 40 years.  You didn't fall for something.  He's confused.  It wasn't like a sleight of hand card trick. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, I fell for the colonoscopy.  Oh, I thought that was the queen.  He was making balloon animals.  And before I knew it, he had a camera on my keister.  Maybe he better edit this out of his tape.  Yeah.  That's the only one that is full.  Oh, man.  All right.  Fell for this.  Let me tell you, a colonoscopy is a big pain in the ass.  That was the kicker on that one?  The punchline. 
[01:09:00]  The colonoscopy is a big pain.  What's that, Brian?  Brian?  It sounds like he's a funny guy.  He's got some good stuff.  You know, but it doesn't matter.  If you start off on the wrong foot and the crowd ain't like, and that's it.  You're dead.  You're dead in the water.  And that's the situation he was in.  And, you know, I feel for him.  You can hear the hecklers organizing that.  It's more like wrestling hecklers.  Right.  They're working as a group.  Right. 
[01:09:30]  Like at the conventions, you know, the delegates do.  Coming on his weight.  It's like the Iron Sheik has shown up.  And he's burning an American flag.  I think there's a pain in the ass line.  It's not a bad, like, aside, like, thing to say.  A throwaway, right?  Yeah, a little throwaway line.  Yeah.  You don't hit that hard.  But you can't say, like, it's hard to set that up and then go, no, no, no.  I've had the colonoscopy, and let me tell you.  Put on your laughing hats.  Like, you don't say the serious.  Seriously. 
[01:10:00]  It was a pain in the ass.  Get ready, Alex.  Here it comes.  Send it up a little too much.  I wouldn't send a night out on a dog like this.  Not on a dog, Alex.  Leave it there.  The cat will get it.  You have no sense of humor.  Well, Billy Staples.  There he is.  All right.  Well, I'll tell you.  Hold on.  Let me tell you.  The worst part is the preparation.  Oh, my God.  Shut up. 
[01:10:30]  Good.  You got it.  It's good.  It's like he's drowning.  It's like he's drowning.  Now it's just pandemonium.  F*** you all.  And right here, he should say, seriously, anyone ever have a colonoscopy?  Yeah.  Right there.  He's missing his mark again.  That's where it just rose up 20 notches and became that full group, became one entity, 
[01:11:00]  just boom.  It literally sounds like the ump just threw Bobby Valentine out of the gate.  And Shay is going crazy.  That's where you've got to look at the crowd and go, hey, my wife likes me.  Ron and Fez likes me.  Go on.  Pick on me if it makes you feel better.  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  Oh, man.  His wife doesn't like him, though.  Yeah.  That's part of the sad part.  That's the sad part, right? 
[01:11:30]  Once again, got to say, everyone's checking in saying the tape doesn't do it justice.  The boos were just deafening.  You could tell.  The crowd was not mic'd, unfortunately.  You could tell at that part it was probably deafening because he can't even talk.  He's got the mic and he's just going, I just, I just, but the, yeah.  He told us last night he was in shock.  He was in shock at that point?  He was in shock.  It was so bad.  Yeah, it certainly sounded like it.  A little more.  Do we have more?  Yeah, there is a really bad a-hole chant coming up. 
[01:12:00]  I don't know how much they're going to let us play, but just in case they dump out, I  just want to let you know.  It went on forever.  Did it?  All right.  You guys going to shut the f*** up for two seconds or what?  Yeah, ask him a question.  Then it better be a two-second joke.  Let me share some with you guys.  Can I at least share something with you?  They go, no.  Good tactic.  Good tactic.  Now it's not me telling jokes.  We're all sharing.  We're going to, I'm going to give you something.  We're in this together, gang. 
[01:12:30]  We're sharing.  Can I share something with you guys?  We're all of the same ilk.  All right.  Can I share now?  This crowd was on.  They didn't miss a beat.  They're like, no.  Another question.  Yeah.  You can't keep asking them.  He's questioning them.  Because that implies that you need them for something.  You just got to smash them.  Are you guys going to let me do this?  No.  No.  No.  That's our answer.  You asked.  You want to hear it?  No.  Does a rapist say, could you please undo the belt?  No.  No.  Just undoes it.  Do it.  Just do it.  Jump in. 
[01:13:00]  Hey, let me share something with you guys.  Can I at least share something with you?  I just joined the 12-step recovery program.  I'm recovering anorexic.  You guys ain't going to laugh at the f***ing thing I say, are you?  That's the big...  No.  They are one.  They are of one single mind.  You never want the crowd to become one.  They have united.  At the beginning, it was all different heckles.  He got this crowd to the point where they were one mind. 
[01:13:30]  He's the white substitute teacher in Harlem right now.  Yeah, it was...  That was a little painful, that joke, too.  A little painful.  You got to whack the crowd hard, man.  Like, if they're giving you stuff like that, you got to go, hey, I'm working.  Do I bother you when you're working by going to McDonald's and knocking the mop out of your hand?  Oh, yeah.  See?  Everyone's elbowing each other.  That's the one.  Hey, now...  Hey, you know you're doing good when they start elbowing each other. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, I'm with you.  Oh, he's good.  Well, he makes up for the fact that he has no timing and no material by acting pathetic and desperate.  You got to beg him.  Begging that he shares.  Can I share something?  Let me share.  Like he said it once and then realized, oh, that's a good word to turn the crowd around.  Sharing.  Sharing is caring.  I know Brian is panicking a little bit.  We got to get him out of here.  And he feels a little longer.  Oh, no.  I got to get to Medford.  No, I know.  You got a really long ride.  That'll take a while. 
[01:14:30]  Friday in the LA, it's fine.  In the summer, when everyone's going out to the hampshire?  Seriously, could you guys get out of the way?  This is the best time to do it, right?  I hope you have a 30 on a Friday.  I hope you have a helicopter.  You're not going to let me get through this traffic.  All right, why don't we say goodbye to Brian?  All right.  Is there still some more time on this tape?  Billy, if you're out there, hang in there, man.  I know it was a rough show.  We all have them.  You know, the crowd didn't go your way. 
[01:15:00]  But, you know, you're all right.  And I hope to see you soon.  Get back on that horse.  Oh, that'll turn him around.  I'm trying, man.  Coming from a guy that I couldn't even imagine getting heckled at all ever on stage, Brian  Rake.  You should have seen me in the Pacific Northwest.  Oh, on that small island off the coast in the Pacific Northwest?  Somewhere?  He's the most universal comic I've ever seen.  I've seen, like, black guys and bikers. 
[01:15:30]  Everybody laughs.  Whether it's some small out-of-the-way island in the Pacific Northwest or maybe somewhere  near Tahiti.  Doesn't matter.  It's universal, Brian Ragan.  Love having you, Brian.  Thanks, man.  Thank you so much.  We really needed somebody in here today.  Hey, no problem.  I hope everything works out, you know.  And, Brian, I hope you can come back with me and Fez get the drive-time show.  Ron.  I love you, man.  I miss you.  Yeah, me too, buddy.  All right.  Ron.  See you soon.  Ron.  I love you like a brother, right? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  But you saw what happened to the last two guys that said that, right?  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  I know.  Hey, I figured the four of us are leaving.  Yeah, we just had to.  Don't know how I feel.  They'll throw all our asses out of here.  Who are we kidding?  Well, let's get the super agent on the phone.  What are we going to do?  That's right.  Thank you, Brian.  Thanks.  Let's get back to the Billy Staples tape.  Will Billy be joining you on stage at the Westbury?  You know what, dude?  I'm not kidding.  If Billy wanted to go on, I'm not messing with him.  I don't do that to other comics.  Dude, he's more than welcome to work with me. 
[01:16:30]  I like the guy.  Yeah.  I think he's a lot funnier than people gave him credit for.  He'd have to be.  He's more than welcome to do that, and I'm not even being polite.  Wow, I wonder if he would.  You think he would take that, Ron?  I don't think that he even wants oxygen anymore.  Let him come out.  It's a gig, man, and he'll have to go on stage a few more times.  He is a funny guy.  It's just that he hadn't been on enough right before that.  Somehow that happens.  Well, let's get back to the tape.  We've got about two more minutes left in this thing.  All right.  Rich Voss comes back out, and then Voss encourages the crowd to get Staples back. 
[01:17:00]  It's getting one more shot.  It gets a little crazy still here.  Billy Staples at Red Bank.  Thank you.  You guys ain't going to laugh at the f***ing thing I say, are you?  I could be the funniest mother f***er in the world when you guys ain't going to laugh, are you?  You're not.  You guys really suck.  What's that? 
[01:17:30]  This is so f***ing blows.  You guys are horrible.  You guys are absolutely f***ing horrible.  You guys want Voss back?  Fine.  You'll get f***ing Voss back.  F*** you.  And that is where he storms off the stage.  And he says that like he's punishing the audience. 
[01:18:00]  Fine.  You're right, Voss.  Fine.  You can't fire me.  I quit.  Right.  Yeah.  That's the mentality he had at that point.  He must have been just completely in shock.  Didn't know what to do.  There was no way he could have jumped back in.  So he just said, screw it.  I'm off.  Dude, in moments like that, it's tempting.  You're just trying to have that moment of clarity alone in your head where you can all make sense of it and then get to what you do.  But when you're sick, that's why you're asking questions.  We all do that as comedians.  It's a stall tactic.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  What do you do for a living?  And they tell you, oh, you do that as you're repeating it.  You're thinking.  It's all trying to get your head together.  And all right, now I can straighten this out.  And he just couldn't because there was too many and they were yelling and he was a little bit, you know, taken back by it.  But you don't ask them to repeat the hateful things.  No, that is something that is.  Get off.  What?  What?  Get off.  I thought that's what you said, but I wanted to clarify.  I didn't want to misquote you, sir.  When he, you hear the certain single guys, single people, not the whole group, yelling out these heckles.  When he said, I could be the funniest guy and you still wouldn't laugh. 
[01:19:00]  Someone just yelled, you're not.  And you're not.  He was giving them every opportunity to hammer him.  Yeah, like, yeah, I bet if I suck, you'd all yell, you suck.  Yeah, you do.  You suck.  That's what they were yelling.  Did we blow off the a-hole chant?  Uh, no.  Part two?  Okay.  Oh, that's in when he returns to the stage.  So now Voss comes back to the stage, it looks like, here.  Part of a riot. 
[01:19:30]  They're all applauding now because Billy has finally decided to leave the stage.  That's what you're hearing here.  And then, you know, Voss is making his way back.  I think Voss is looking behind him because he's never heard applause walking out before.  Wow.  Billy Staples.  You wouldn't think you'd be so happy to see Rich Voss again that quick, huh?  This just turned from the Red Bank Theater to the white Apollo. 
[01:20:00]  Now, he's getting some good luck.  That's funny.  That's funny.  Sure.  The Apollo.  Sure.  It's like fun with Mussolini in World War II.  Of course they're going to love it.  Yeah.  Anybody could have come up there.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Billy, you don't want to just try a few more?  F*** it.  Now, Voss is an ass right here. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  He loved it a little too much.  He was enjoying it.  He thought, I want more.  Bring him back out.  And he talks him back out on stage.  Making him believe he cares.  He wanted to see Billy eat it just a little more.  Do two more.  F*** them.  He's going to do two.  All right.  So now, here comes Billy.  Billy decides to come back onto the stage.  I've just been told they've got to do another 20 minutes. 
[01:21:00]  Look how quickly.  Let me ask the ladies a question here tonight.  Ladies, I want to ask you a question.  And I want you to answer it as honestly and quickly as you can.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Does size matter?  Holy s***.  We got a lot of sluts here tonight.  See, it took a little long.  What's that mean? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  What's that mean?  18 seconds or 20 seconds.  When you go back out like that.  The audience is as rotten as they can be.  Want to have a good time.  They would have.  But you just got to hit them, man.  You can't pause.  He stopped.  He's ladies.  Another question for the audience.  Are you ready to laugh?  Another question.  I mean, when you have your second shot like that and walk out, now you've had time to reflect.  You take your atomic bomb out there. 
[01:22:00]  You take the biggest weapon in your arsenal and hit him right between the eyes.  Yep.  Not another question for the audience.  And then they call all the women sluts.  Right.  And now he's alienated.  I really didn't hear too many women's voices during those heckles.  But now he's brought them on board.  I do the tape.  Hey, anybody doesn't think size matter?  Girls, where are you?  You guys don't get it. 
[01:22:30]  You guys just don't get it.  I'm talking size.  You guys ain't giving me a chance, are you?  F*** you, man.  So what?  No f***ing tomatoes?  No nothing.  Where are you, pussies?  Holy shit.  What?  Thank you.  Thank you so much. 
[01:23:00]  You've been so kind.  And there he goes.  And that's when he walked off for the second time.  Now that A-hole chant, I don't know if they let it through.  Maybe they let some of it through.  That went on for a really long time.  We had to cut that down a little bit there.  And then he was just standing there as they were chanting.  And then he said, F*** you.  I think he gave the crowd the finger and all that, too, as he was walking off.  Yeah, something like that.  But there's still a little more on there.  You hear an exchange between him and Rich.  Okay.  Oh.  I didn't know these animals were going to do this. 
[01:23:30]  Billy Staples walking off like a pumpkin.  Billy Staples.  He's a good friend.  And you know what?  That's going to be a long drive home to Long Island.  Ah, boss.  Boss really is a mean spirit.  Yeah, a creep.  Did you hear him, though?  He thought no one was listening, you know?  What did he say?  Because he kind of pulled the mic aside.  And he goes, I don't know these animals were going to do this.  He didn't pull the mic aside.  He's too stupid to understand.  He's like, well, I want it to be a secret, so it will be. 
[01:24:00]  Boss would cover his eyes with his little midget Jewish hands and go, no one can see me.  Rich, you're a dummy.  Rich, you're an animal.  Do those thoughts cohabit, you mooks?  And, Norton, you really want him to go back up again.  You know what?  I don't do that to mess with people.  I like Billy, man.  If he wants to work Long Island with me, he's welcome to.  I don't even want him to own cable anymore.  I don't want him to even see comedy.  I'm concerned about him.  Yeah, that was... 
[01:24:30]  That's the stop.  What Billy's got to realize is that's the fear.  People's greatest fear in life is public speaking.  And almost 99.99% of the public could never take what he took and then get back up again.  That's what's going to make you different.  You're a comic, man.  You took it in the face.  Be a trooper.  Get back up.  That's it.  Get back up.  Never let them beat you.  Ever.  You know, he sounded like a broken, defeated man on your show last night, Ron.  Yeah, it was awful.  Yeah, it was.  It was depressing to listen to.  I was like a...  I so wanted to call up and just say, Patton should slap your fat face. 
[01:25:00]  Well, I think a lot of that is just the pills.  You think it's the pills?  It's the pills, but probably...  Where do they wear off?  And he just feels the full burn.  And what's he doing in Pennsylvania?  Yellow belly.  It's as far as he could drive.  Is that it?  Yeah, I mean, you have to...  You know, he rented a car that he hasn't returned, but you still have to buy gas.  So he got as far as Amish country, and he's just sitting there with a brown paper bag drinking out of it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Taking the last of his pills.  All right, Ronnie, thank you so much.  All right, see you guys in a little bit.  We're going to leave this tape for you, because I'm sure you'll have a lot more to add to this  when you're hanging with Fezzy later tonight here in New York.  We're going to dupe it and sell copies.  There you go.  Hey, see you guys.  You're the best.  Thank you.  Bye, Ron.  All right, my friend.  All right.  There he goes, Ron from Ron and Fez.  Ron.  On right after us here in New York City.  There you go.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, hold on to your seats, kids. 
[01:26:00]  A lot of people were checking in going, guys, you sound a little mellow so far in the show today.  And I had to tell everyone, you know, we're saving our energy because Mario Cantone's going  to be in here in a few minutes.  We're going to be in here in a few minutes.  We're going to be in here in a few minutes.  And we've got to be on his level.  That's right.  This is a mad man.  So we all just did crystal meth so we could get on the same level. 
[01:26:30]  And here he is.  You guys, I have appeared.  I have appeared out of nowhere.  It's crank, Opie.  Crank.  Crank.  Yeah.  Crank.  That's the street name for it.  Is it really crank?  Yeah, they call it crank.  Crank.  Crystal meth.  I believe in crystal meth because I believe in me.  I believe in crank.  All right, so we've got Eddie from Big Brother in the studio and Mario Cantone.  Eddie, my big brother's here.  Eddie, you're my big brother.  Eddie.  The big brother.  He's the biggest brother. 
[01:27:00]  Can I just say, like, I never watched Big Brother, Eddie.  I'm sorry to say.  Oh, my God.  But you know what?  Can't you fake it at least?  Oh, you are marvelous.  You're indicated, though.  You're playing results.  You're playing the end of the scene.  There's no playing the end of the scene in reality television.  No.  I can't do the reality television.  You don't like the reality, huh?  I'm going to tell you something.  And, you know, at least the Ling on the View is always talking about,  A temptation.  I can't stop watching.  I don't care if they're together for nine years and some big, hot, 
[01:27:30]  breasted woman comes with some guy with a huge thing,  and they just slam each other and plow each other on the beach.  I don't care.  Because you know why?  It's not the theater.  It's not theater.  It's not real.  It's nothing.  I can't watch it.  I'll tell you what.  You know what?  The real world I watch for, like, you know what I discovered the real world?  On a marathon.  I was, like, real world junkie after about five episodes.  I had to go to a meeting.  I was like, okay, just one more.  Just one more.  That's what you do.  Right, one more.  It's a marathon.  It's like, okay, next Miami and now Seattle. 
[01:28:00]  Did you see what they did, too, with the marathon?  They cut out the intros at the beginning.  So it was, like, one huge episode.  So you didn't even have an opportunity to leave.  You had no idea when the one episode ended and the next one began.  It's horrifying.  I'm like, just one more.  I was ten episodes in before I realized.  I had a problem.  Yes, I had a real world problem.  I'm a real world a harlot.  We were big fans of Puck.  The San Francisco real world to this day is the best one ever.  Yeah, that is the best one because he was the most, uh.  He was.  He was a prick.  Oh, he was an ass. 
[01:28:30]  I hated him.  And, you know, he thought he was going to be a big star.  Ha, ha, where is he now?  In a gutter.  He's in a gutter somewhere with some ripple shoved up his arms.  Blowing snot rockets.  He was so like, oh, I'm going to appear.  It's my ass, man.  He's ridiculous.  I'm going to appear, dude.  Ass doesn't exist.  Oh, man.  So what?  He's a fight.  Come on.  Let's go.  Let's ride this bike.  Hey.  He's an ass.  I cannot live in this environment.  Puck.  Oh, you do.  I cannot live in this environment. 
[01:29:00]  This is not a healthy environment.  Okay.  That's really quite irritating.  That's.  And then remember that one where he goes, Puck, I saw you.  You put your finger in the peanut butter.  First, you'll pick your scars.  You'll pick your scars, then you'll put your finger in the peanut butter.  Yeah.  See?  And the good die young, and Puck wanders the country.  Puck pedals on.  Yeah, just pedals on.  He pedals his speedo 10 speed.  Remember when he told that chick, hey, Chubbs. 
[01:29:30]  Called her Chubbs.  Chubbs.  And she's like, what?  He goes, oh, come on.  We all see it.  The guy was classless.  But he made it interesting to watch.  He did make it interesting to watch.  Well, that's the whole.  That's what makes it interesting is when there's controversy and conflict.  So what's your problem with reality shows?  Well, I just don't.  I don't.  You don't like the Survivor?  I don't want to get into them because I know if I do, I'll be.  I'll just.  I'll watch them, and I don't want to do that.  I can't commit to things, you know?  You can only watch so much.  Commit to a TV show. 
[01:30:00]  You can't even do that.  Oh, no.  It's South Park Soprano, Sex of the City.  I'm done.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  You do the Sex of the City, huh?  I'm going to be on Sex of the City.  Are you?  Oh, look at this.  I was on it once last year, and it created quite a little buzz, and I'm doing four more  episodes this year.  Now, look at you.  I'm a good reoccurring.  I'm a reoccurring character named Anthony Mandela.  What was your part?  Anthony Maratino.  I was Kristen Davis' wedding consultant, and I'm a designer, and she becomes friendly  with me this season.  It's a very funny part.  I'm a designer on it, basically. 
[01:30:30]  It's a good part.  I had a good time.  I like the show.  And Michael Patrick King is the reason why I did it, because he put me on the damn  thing.  Because I'll tell you something.  I can't get a sitcom to save my wicked ass.  I can't.  I can't.  People go, you can make it funny.  I can't make funny that's not funny.  I can't.  I'm the worst audition in the world.  I go in, I'm like, I can't do sitcom.  I can't do sitcom.  You get like a script, and you try to run through it.  Oh, if you.  Wait, hold on one second.  Wait, you're joking.  Wait, hold on.  Okay, I'm done. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, my God.  But I've got to tell you, that's a good throw-off, isn't it?  Very good, yes.  Because every time people throw up in movies, they cough before.  I have never coughed before I throw up, or coughed during the throw-off.  You know how people call it, they're like, like Jill Kleberg in The Unmarried Woman.  She throws up on the street after Michael Murphy divorces her, and she's coughing, and  then green comes out of her mouth. 
[01:31:30]  You don't cough before you throw up.  It's impossible.  It's a bad acting choice, and people do it all the time, and they should stop it.  So you just go, bleh, bleh.  It's a projectile vomit.  It's like bleh.  You feel it from the gut.  I don't mean to sound like Stella Adler, but you have to feel it from the gut.  It's got to come up.  I'm Uta Haagen-Dazs.  I know what I'm talking about.  Ed!  Very good.  So we learned how to puke.  So anyway, I'm going to be on Second City, so I'm very excited.  I finally am a reader.  And you don't like the sitcoms. 
[01:32:00]  I do like the sitcoms.  You read the script, and then it's like, ah.  I'm a bad practitioner.  I'm a real bad.  Even when someone sees me and goes, oh my God, he was great on stage, come in, da-da-da-da,  I get in there.  Get all nervous.  I don't get nervous.  I swear to God.  It's almost like, I just, then they're like, you go in and they're like, they don't want you  to be, they're like, okay, this character, we're having you in, but we don't want you,  we don't want it being outrageous or crazy or flamboyant.  I'm like, then what am I doing here?  Do you want me to take it down a little bit for reality, reality? 
[01:32:30]  It's reality.  It's revolving.  It's revolving.  You know?  You crack us the F up, man.  I love you guys.  You crack us the F up.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You just crack us the F up.  I love you guys.  Hey, I know you like the theater, so I'm going to admit something.  I went and saw Cabaret.  You saw Cabaret?  I'm sitting alone in your womb.  I'm here on music.  Play.  I have a great line of an Ellie story. 
[01:33:00]  It's so special to be here, fellas.  I'm so happy.  I can't hold my coffee.  It's falling.  It's dripping.  Can I get, I want some Coca-Cola with chocolate syrup and a jelly donut.  Can you get that for me?  Could somebody?  Okay, here's what happened.  This is the funniest story in the world.  So you saw Cabaret.  Let's start with that.  First of all, my very good friend Fred Ebb wrote that show in John Kander.  It wasn't that bad.  It's a great show.  Look at me.  I'm not really a theater type of guy, but I went and it was all right. 
[01:33:30]  Matt McGrath, you saw him do the emcee.  He was brilliant.  He was really good.  He was a good friend.  He was really good.  He was so brilliant.  I got to go see it again.  But did you ever see the movie?  No.  Oh, the movie's brilliant.  And it's not a musical where they like break out into song.  All the musical performances.  All the music.  I just burped right on the camera.  Cough.  It doesn't say burp.  It says cough.  I didn't press it.  So all the musical performances come out of like just the performance in the cabaret.  I'll tell you something.  It's a great, great movie.  Bob Fosse.  See, it was brilliant. 
[01:34:00]  And Miss Minnelli, I didn't think I was going to get the Oscar that year.  I thought I was going to get it for sterile cuckoo.  And then I didn't think I was going to get it for cabaret.  And I just, they made me very happy.  Can I get some cuckoo cullers and chocolate shabby and a jelly donut?  Wasn't Desi Arnest Jr. in the sterile cuckoo?  Wasn't he in the...  I don't know.  It was actually Wendell.  No, it was Wendell something.  What about tell me that you love me, Julie Moon, when she had the acid I poured on her 
[01:34:30]  face with her scars.  And Otto, come on, you're the doctor.  Liza, cut your stupid dog.  Do you have a Liza story?  Okay, here's my Liza story.  I do.  It's very funny.  Well, you know, because I know her.  And like, well, the first time I met her, I was in Fred Ebbs' kitchen and he made me  do her for her.  So I put her over the table and I did her.  Say, bitch, come here.  Sing maybe this time while I do it.  But, um, so, I did this, I did this, um, my lawyer had a 50th anniversary birthday party 
[01:35:00]  for himself and he produced this big show for me and everybody sang on it, like all  these cabaret people and Broadway people did it.  So Liza Minnelli was in the audience and I got up and I did 10 minutes and it was a great  night.  But in the middle of it I went, I said, you know, Liza Minnelli's here tonight and everybody's  like, oh, she's here, yeah, you know.  And I was like, glad you're out and about, you're doing well.  I said, but I'm going to do you anyway.  And she goes, please be kind, from the dark you hear, please be kind.  I was like, okay, I'm, please, please be kind.  I was like, okay, I'll be kind. 
[01:35:30]  So then I just did it, forgetting the words to every song she ever knew.  Oh, God.  But she loves that.  She thinks it's funny.  And then I do her in the vagina monologues.  Oh.  Thank God monologues came in after.  I was like, oh, you were shaking like that.  She gabbered while I bowed it.  She seems a little strange, though, in real life.  She's having a tough time.  But you know what?  She's doing okay right now.  I don't even mean now.  I mean, like, she's always seemed a little.  Well, you know, her mother was Judy Garland. 
[01:36:00]  Well, she's not upset, I guess.  Who was the greatest, probably one of the greatest entertainers in the world.  But, you know, she's, you know, when you live with that, you, and Lorna going off about it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, she's Miss Twelve Step now.  Any good Liza lines from Arthur?  Oh, God, you know that I haven't seen that movie in so long.  Really?  I saw it once after my mother died, and I was miserable.  So I was like, this isn't funny.  But nothing was funny.  Everybody's dying.  Oh, I did. 
[01:36:30]  I was like, I saw it once after my mother died, and I just didn't get it.  And I never saw it again.  But you know what?  That drunk thing, I can't.  Yes.  And Liza, well, I should say.  Well, when they got to the second one, it was like, it wasn't funny anymore.  Was she in it?  It's like, Arthur, you have a problem.  Was she in it?  Yeah.  Yeah, the second one, very long.  Like, the first one was kind of, you know, funny, because he's just, you know, one small  through the park, bitch.  I mean, you know, it was kind of funny.  The second one, all right, he's still drunk.  Jeez.  Arthur, check yourself in somewhere.  It's not funny anymore.  Did it end with a 12-step meeting, or what? 
[01:37:00]  It should have.  It should have.  Oh, God.  I don't think anyone made it to the end of that movie.  No.  I don't think I saw it, the whole thing.  Al, what's up?  Hey, guys, how are you?  Hey.  Hey.  I'm Matt.  What?  I'm saying hi to Mario.  Hi, Al, how you doing?  Hi, good, Mario.  Today's my birthday.  Happy birthday.  Are you on a cell phone?  Yes, could you just take your balls out for everything dedicated to me for my birthday?  Oh, you want me to sing what?  I know.  Take your balls out.  Oh, sure I will.  This is for you, for your birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Get your balls out, slap your ass up, slap your scrotum, it's today, though it may not 
[01:37:30]  be anyone's birthday, and it's not in the 4th of July.  I can't believe you will ask, I love to change the Jerry Herman lyric.  That's a fun thing to do.  That's a sweeper for our show, you know.  We play it together.  Oh, we play that all the time.  It's hilarious.  Hilarious.  You children are marvelous.  You're marvelous.  Miss Betsy Davis has had several strokes, and my mouth is not nowhere to be found. 
[01:38:00]  I can't find my mouth.  Have you ever seen her at the end of her life?  She was like, oh, yes, where's my mouth?  It was on the left side.  I don't know where it is.  Is it on the floor?  Did you ever see her on Johnny Carson?  Yeah.  Did we talk about this last time?  I don't think so.  I remember seeing that, though.  I have with our tape.  She was like, she went off about something.  Johnny trying to be very respectful.  Very respectful.  He was the first time.  The second time, I think he was a little... 
[01:38:30]  He had it.  All right, then.  You got some, like, weird hat on now.  You need to go home.  Yeah.  But she would go off.  The second time, she was a little, like, more contained.  I mean, the first time, she, like, went off about Faye Dunaway, which was, like, awesome,  about...  Miss Dunaway is totally and utterly unprofessional, Miss Faye Dunaway.  That bitch kept thousands of extras waiting.  We did the disappearance of Amy Simple McPherson.  She played the evangelist.  I was her mother. 
[01:39:00]  She really was the mother, but I was her mother.  She kept thousands of extras waiting.  There they were with their box lunches sitting in their laps.  And she finally...  I have to sing, I've written a letter to get daddy.  Three times to entertain these bastards with their box lunches.  Then Miss Dunaway graces us with her presence.  I turned and said, Miss Dunaway, did you get your eyeliner on right yet?  No, what?  She's a bitch.  Joan Crawford is another bitch. 
[01:39:30]  She went off about Crawford.  She said, her breasts were a different size every day during Baby Jane.  It was like bumping into the Hollywood Hills.  God damn, that sounds just...  I love doing her after the stroke.  The post-stroke.  It's the best time.  Why not?  You've got to do them like at the end.  Right.  Because what's the point?  Julie.  Hi.  I love you guys.  And Mario, you are hilarious.  Thank you, Julie.  Could you please, please, please do Joan Crawford at Mommy Dearest? 
[01:40:00]  Oh.  What's...  You had me driving off the road the last time you did that.  Please.  What's your name?  Julie.  Julie, darling.  Did you clean your room today?  What's in your hair, Julie?  Is it setting solution?  You're mocking me.  What did I tell you?  Get out of that bed.  Get out of that bed.  Scrum it.  Do you call this clean?  Do you?  Mrs. Jenkins said it was clean.  But do you think it's clean?  Thank you so much. 
[01:40:30]  You've made my day.  You're welcome.  Just call me the video jukebox.  Come on up my ass and I'll do what you want.  Get your balls out.  I wish there was cameras here because I'm making fun things with these covers.  I see that.  Hey, Tom, what's going on?  All right.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  I used to be a homophobe, but I love this guy.  You see?  I change everybody.  He's a riot.  Come see me at Caroline.  How about some Richard Simmons?  Today we're going to sweat to the oldies and stretch to the classics. 
[01:41:00]  Let me tell you something right now.  I used to do him on Seen by Belly and I would make him like every villain.  This is the kid show that I had.  I used to make him every villain in the world.  I used to make him kidnap like Betty Croft.  It was like Misery instead of kidnapping the writing.  He kidnapped Betty Croft.  And he was like, if you say nutmeg, I'll hobble you.  Richard Simmons.  Well, what happened to him?  Oh, make a wish.  It's the dream wish show.  I'm going to make your wish come true.  What's my wish?  What's your wish?  We all have wishes.  My wish is that it was canceled. 
[01:41:30]  That's my wish.  I do have to stop whenever the infomercials are on.  Because when he gets the fat women and they start crying and he's handing them that plastic  thing where you slide the little windows over and when all the windows are closed, you're  done.  It's stealing you.  No, this was something else.  It's different than the cars.  It's the same concept.  You just packaged it different.  In this little wallet thing, you open up.  It's plastic.  Oh, yeah.  It's got the windows in it.  Right.  And you slide it over.  Depending on meat, okay, you had five portions of this. 
[01:42:00]  And then when all your windows are closed, you're done eating for the day.  Yeah.  And then you're starving.  Yeah.  Then you eat the plastic cake.  Exactly.  Then you eat the little slides.  But then he baits the women into crying.  Of course he does.  He's the famous baker of weight loss.  It's ridiculous.  How was it when you were fat?  And then they got to go into it and they start crying.  And they cry.  I would be glued at night.  Like three in the morning.  Yeah.  And be like, oh my God, they're crying.  And my husband left me.  I can't turn away from some of those infomercials.  Anything Ron Popeil? 
[01:42:30]  Well, I got to see how the hell he's drying this beef jerky all by himself in the house.  Well, he's drying his beef jerky all by himself in the house.  Like a fisherman?  And then stick it through a pasta maker.  There you go.  John, what's up?  Hey, Mario.  I got a quick question for you.  Okay, John.  Go ahead.  Where do we stand in the closet?  I mean, how far out are we?  Are you really asking me that?  I'm very out.  Okay.  I just wanted to know.  And the other question I have for you is that.  Get your balls out?  But I transcend, baby. 
[01:43:00]  I hear you.  The other question I have for you is that when can we expect another kids show starting new?  You will never, ever see it again.  And I'm going to tell you something right now.  Thank God.  As much as I enjoyed it, it was an accident, an abortion, and the children were merely props to me.  I mean, you know, I had a good time.  But it was, look, I had a lot of, it was a lot of creative leeway.  I, we got away with a lot of stuff, but, um, you know.  Do you ever think people would still remember it, though? 
[01:43:30]  People remember it.  Well, when you were doing it, did you think, like, years later, people would still go,  No.  No.  Steampi Ballinger.  That's how, in fact, people either, like, thought it was horrifying or they loved it.  It was no way.  I had a little of both.  Yeah, well, let's do it.  There were times I would tune in and be completely horrified of what was going on.  Oh, sure.  And again, couldn't tune away.  Made an impression, you know.  It stayed, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I just got an email yesterday from  some guy named Dean Jones in Rockaway, New Jersey, and he was, it was such a nice thing  about his being a single father, and he had a very dark period in his life, and his kids  used to watch it.  It was, you know, sometimes you get, you know, I still get letters, and people stop you all 
[01:44:00]  the time, but.  Because I'd always go, they, they're allowing this man around young children?  And the kids were like.  He's insane.  He had no idea what I was doing.  They were just drooling, and they had the Hanna-Barbera straight smile across their face.  You know what I mean?  It was like, oh, they had no idea what I was doing.  But.  And there you are, you know, being creative, coming up with things.  Where did you have meetings with your production people, or to get these things together?  And, and then when did it hit you that I'm doing this in front of drooling children  that don't even get the references? 
[01:44:30]  Well, I had to slide down this pole every day and do an opening monologue, and the kids  were like, they had no idea.  Well, I was like, trying to be like, you know, Johnny Carson.  It was ridiculous.  A monologue to a bunch of kids.  A monologue to a bunch of kids.  And my producer was like, yeah, do a monologue.  I was like, are you out of your mind?  It's bad enough that I.  You're like, tough room.  I used to scare, I, it was, I scared them.  I scared the children.  And the adults loved it.  The adults will still stop me on the street.  And the children are like, I don't remember him.  They blocked me out.  That's right. 
[01:45:00]  Jeff, what's up?  How you doing, Marty?  You're so funny.  I'm ready to drive off the road to Northern State Parkway here.  Jeff, I love hearing that.  That's awesome.  I was kind of wondering if you could do an Ethel Merman.  No, you know what?  I don't do Ethel Merman.  Kevin Meaney does Ethel Merman.  Yeah.  But, but, but I, I, I, she, she, you know what?  I got to tell you a secret.  I never liked Ethel Merman.  That's a horrible thing to say for someone that's in the theater.  I never liked her.  And the reason why, and she was supposed to be incredible on stage.  But, you know, years ago, they didn't have microphones.  You weren't miked in a musical. 
[01:45:30]  So you had to send your voice to the back of the house.  And she was like, you know, come on, love.  Come on, love.  Come on, love.  Come on, love.  Come on, man.  Come on, man.  Oh, God.  You guys are great.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  Get your balls out.  Speaking of that song, Mike has a quick story.  Mike, what's up?  Yo, man.  Hey.  You're part of the reason my girlfriend broke up with me, man.  Why?  Because when I hear something funny, I start saying it all the time.  I'm walking around the house.  Get your balls out. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Oh, and then you, too.  I'm like, eh, eh, eh, ooh, eh.  Around the house all the time.  It does stick in your head.  Yeah.  You're walking around the house.  Get your balls out.  It's like, what am I saying?  What the hell am I saying?  We should take a break.  Peace out.  Peace out, yo.  Peace out.  Hey.  Yo, peace out.  You're sticking around for a little while, right?  I've got to be here, yeah.  I'm not going anywhere.  More with Mario.  Stay there.  The guy never rests.  I can't say anything.  It's Eddie from Big Brother.  Yo.  Mario Cantone.  Please, Mr. Mackey. 
[01:46:30]  Please don't make me down that old kid's wire.  Please, Mr. Mackey.  You guys, seriously?  My ass is so wet right now.  Because I'm, like, in these rubber pants.  Because, like, I pooped my hair.  Dance, dance, dance.  I love that dance, dance, dance.  Rock on!  Yeah!  Clack, clack.  Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack. 
[01:47:00]  Head banger!  Oh, the rock and the road, you know?  Anthony wants to talk about Judy Garland.  I got a thing today.  I got this from you.  You just handed me this.  It says, please let Mario talk about the Judy Garland movie of the week.  I don't know if anybody saw it, but I'll tell you something.  It was pretty, you guys could, you watched it for a minute, you were like, I can't take it.  When I was flipping around, I was like, oof.  Well, it's...  Can't lie to you, man.  All right, I know you can't lie to me.  It's a little rough.  Look, I accept you.  You accept me.  Okay, that's fair. 
[01:47:30]  I'm like, you know, Susan Powder.  Fat, you're fat.  Fat times fat equals fat.  Fat divided by fat is fat.  Your ass is fat.  Fat.  I remember her.  I remember her.  Susan Powder.  Susan Powder.  And she would actually sell...  Yeah, she was the girl with the crew cut.  Yeah.  And she would actually sell breathing.  Oh.  You need to breathe.  Yeah, that's right.  And I'm sitting there going, she's telling people they need to breathe.  Yeah, no crap, Sherlock. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, she's breathing.  Don't even get me started.  I'm living upstairs with my ex-husband.  That's healthy.  And then she always had the picture of her sprawled out big and fat.  Yeah.  And look at me in my sweats with my crack in my ass.  Yeah.  Pulled up and rolled up.  So, yeah, let me just say that the movie was brilliant.  The ratings were through the roof, ladies and gentlemen.  Tammy Blanchett, who played Judy Garland when she was young, was unbelievable.  She was unreal. 
[01:48:30]  And then Judy Davis played her when she was old.  They switched them too soon.  The girl, the younger one should have played her a little longer.  Because, you know, but when Judy got older, Judy Davis was genius.  It was pretty great.  But when Judy got, because when she came on, when Judy Davis came on, her voice was so low right away.  She was like, uh-uh, really?  And then she got older and then it worked.  But at the beginning it was like, she's already drinking too much.  See, I had a problem with the Mommy Dearest thing when they switched the kid.  Yeah, well, because. 
[01:49:00]  It's a little stark.  It is a little stark.  And then the girl they got to play, the older daughter, oh my God, was she horrible.  She had her brain stalled by a pod.  Oh my God, was she horrible.  It was horrifying.  The kid was great.  The kid was great.  Yeah.  When the kid's crying, she just looks up and goes, Jesus Christ.  That was great.  And she goes, I'm not going to play with you anymore.  Ever.  Don't you take that tone with me, Missy.  And then they switched to the older one.  She's like, why?  What was her opening scene there?  She's like, you ask me. 
[01:49:30]  It was like the most boring.  It was a monologue.  Understand.  I understand.  It was a monologue she was doing.  Understand.  Boarding school.  Understand.  You have no personality.  So anyway, great movie.  And if it's repeated, get it or buy it or see it.  It's pretty.  It's great.  Now, some of the Judy Garland things from the end of her career, when she was on the  talk shows or just giving a speech.  Be careful.  You don't make them cry.  She's a big Judy Garland fan.  I love Judy Garland.  She's one of the...  Hey, let me tell you something.  Frank Sinatra loved Judy Garland. 
[01:50:00]  And Tony Bennett loves Judy Garland.  And, you know, they're not taking it up the...  But, you know, my ass hurts.  So, I mean, you know, if you see some of her...  You know what you've got to do?  I'll tell you, see her CBS stuff is on DVD and on video.  And I'll tell you, when you see her perform live, she was insane.  She was a monster.  Her voice was bigger.  She was emotional.  I just like the drunk interviews. 
[01:50:30]  You like it when she's like, oh, my.  You're so marvelous.  You're marvelous.  You sing your thrilling.  You're just...  Uh-oh.  Really?  I'm not.  You're...  That's what I kind of like.  I love her too.  That's how I do her at the end too.  Always at the end.  You're marvelous.  I'd like to sing a song if I can remember.  What are we doing now?  All liquored up.  You're going to love it.  You know what, though?  Alan King told me she only drank white wine.  Oh, really?  But she loved her pills. 
[01:51:00]  I just, I, I, you know, I, you know, Louis B. Mayer gave them to me and I, I was off and running.  You're marvelous.  You boys are marvelous.  I'd like to sing a song.  A dedicated ad.  I just want to go off.  All right, Dominic, what's going on?  Get your balls down.  My neighbors are going to arrest me.  Hey, Mario, your Italian funeral was a classic.  I love you.  Oh, God.  You know, it kills my voice, which I, why I don't do it too much anymore. 
[01:51:30]  But it's, it's, it's, you know, it's real, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know, yeah.  The, the, the first funeral I ever had was, was my cousin Tommy.  He was killed.  He was 36 years old, shot.  32, actually.  36, 32.  I don't know.  He was f***ing old.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, the sponsors.  He was, yeah.  I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry.  We got plenty of delay.  We could jump out of that stuff.  Thank you.  Um, I just said the F-Wake on TV, you guys.  I mean, there you go. 
[01:52:00]  I'm on duty today.  I don't know where I am.  This is television.  I don't know where I am on the radio.  I said, I put that bottle down.  So, um, yeah, and I, the, the, the first one was my cousin Tommy.  And I, I had no idea.  And, you know, they opened the casket.  And the denial.  I mean, they come in.  They're like, ah, he's dead.  It should have been me.  And then they're like, and then they're like, it was cheese.  He ate too much cheese.  Like five bullet holes in his head.  It was too much cheese. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, they were insane.  Those, those were scary.  They were scary.  But, uh, then, you know, they came two a year after that.  So that was good.  Oh.  Oh, two a year.  And then you got a, yeah, they're very uncomfortable.  Oh, they were uncomfortable.  People freaking out.  And you're just walking around like, oh, okay, what do I do?  Uh, well, my mother died.  And I was like, let's do this with some dignity, please.  Let's not, like, drag her out of the casket and throw it all.  Oh, God.  Let's do it with dignity.  And we did.  We actually did.  Because there are people that walk up there.  Oh, yeah.  And they just start going, blah.  And they're grabbing at the body.  And they're shaking it. 
[01:53:00]  See, my immediate family was very, very good.  They were very, they were, I have to say, I have a great family.  And my cousins, however, I love them.  But they will be the first to drag you out of the coffin and try to get you to walk and  put strings on you and make a marionette out of you so they can live with you again.  Oh, my God.  Or maybe kidnap you, bury you at the pet cemetery and hope for life.  Maybe some green muck-looking life.  Was he involved in any activities?  My cousin Tommy, oh, yeah.  He was, he was.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Hey, Tommy. 
[01:53:30]  Tommy, yeah.  Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy was, he was a lunatic.  I mean, he had a big house and pool and da-da-da and he was a lunatic.  He was a control freak.  And he was so against drugs when he was younger.  I mean, if, you know, if his sister smoked a joint, he was like, you cannot be doing  that.  What happened was he got involved with cocaine.  He started selling it first and then he started doing it and then that was the end.  Don't get high on your own supply.  No, that's what happened.  Thank you, Scarfish.  I like that, huh?  Yeah.  It's Al Pacino. 
[01:54:00]  He's a marvelous actor, Al Pacino.  John.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  I was listening at Italian funeral.  I was just that one.  And the people are there going, oh, doesn't he look beautiful?  Of course.  Did he look good, though?  He looks good, though.  He looks dead.  He looks dead.  They never look good.  How do you look beautiful when you're dead?  I don't like looking.  It's part of the denial.  I don't like looking.  I can't.  It's horrible.  I like looking when they're alive and then when they're dead and they get the open casket  thing.  I walk by and I'm looking at the ground.  I walk.  I make it look like, you know, I'm paying my respects. 
[01:54:30]  But I never look.  No, you know what?  God forbid they move.  I'll tell you, when it's someone close, you go, I think I saw her move.  It's really weird.  It's really weird.  It's because the ant is pulling on his feet.  Get out.  Help!  It's Pinocchio, man.  Well, I'll tell you, the reason why they say they look good, though, also, is because  they have to, it's part of them living with them still.  Look, it's a hard thing to deal with, but...  I don't know.  It's not fun when the death comes. 
[01:55:00]  Hey, Frank, what's going on?  Hey, I just want to say, I love you, Mario.  I think you're the funniest.  Thank you, Frank.  Did you see a play this season called Christmas with the Crawfords?  No, I did not see it.  Oh, it was hilarious.  I've heard it was very hilarious.  Joey Arias.  Really?  Yeah, everybody was in drag, and Joey Arias gets up there and hits, like, this guy who's  dressed like Christina and goes, come on, why can't you clean up these dishes?  Get you clean!  It's so funny.  I wish I had seen it.  I didn't see it.  I was doing a play at the time, too. 
[01:55:30]  The Crumple Zone?  I was doing the Crunky.  Yeah, the Crumple Zone.  I saw that, too.  That was great.  You came to see it?  Yeah, I still have your, I still have a copy of HX with you on the cover.  Ah, my big mouth up with, like, a stupid ass?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a lovely picture.  Please rip it up.  We are so out of this conversation.  No, it's a block.  We might as well be in another country.  I did an off-road play called The Crumple Zone that got really great reviews this past  year, and I did six months with it, and it was, um, and we got a love letter in the  New York Times from Bruce Weber, and that's what you wait for is a great love letter.  Man, I just started my little theater career by going to Cabaret. 
[01:56:00]  I didn't know it goes so deep.  I want to meet your girlfriend.  I want to meet your girlfriend because I'm going to be like, take him to the theater.  Take him, make him watch the Judy Garden special with Frank Dean.  Make him, make him.  Tom, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Man, I forgot about the aunt that takes pictures of a dead body.  Oh, no.  Oh, you know what?  That happened at my cousin's funeral.  Get out.  Get out of my grandfather.  Not good.  What are you going to look through the boat?  Look, and there he is when he was dead.  I mean, what do you, you know, what do you say? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, man.  What about that Dana Plato's funeral?  The boyfriend or whatever it was brought a video camera and videotaped it just so he  could sell it later.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Isn't that great?  Oh, and you know, we love those solid relationships.  You know, get your drugs out.  All right, chick flicks.  All right, what?  Yeah.  So you hate it, chick flicks.  No, no, no.  Rick saw it.  You saw it.  Object.  It's really good.  It was a good movie.  It's a great movie, you know.  It wasn't as much of a chick flick as everybody thought it was going to be. 
[01:57:00]  Anthony and I, we see maybe that preview and we just go, no, I don't.  Yeah, I really won't be interested.  See the chocolate.  And then we ask Rick, we go, okay, Rick, defend yourself.  You said it's a good movie.  What was it about?  And he goes, oh, it's a girl and she makes these chocolates.  And we were just like, ah, you're really doing a great job, Rick.  Great job.  No, wait, listen to him explain what chocolate was.  What?  And we told him.  I tried to sum it up in one sentence to make it quick.  It's about a woman that comes to this very morbid, depressed town and makes a difference 
[01:57:30]  with her chocolate.  Okay, see?  Hey, lick my chocolate breast, you guys.  Come here, lick my chocolate breast.  I'll make a difference in this depressing turn.  Come here and lick my chocolate libya.  I'll make them as a chocolate.  You might catch them, you're sweet and keen.  That's what it was about.  Yeah, but see, it sounds like a chick flick.  So why should we run to the theater with that?  Besides that, what else was a chick flick that you got? 
[01:58:00]  Okay.  The biggie is, Opie went to see the biggie chick flick in the movie theater.  This was the last chick flick I went to see.  It would be Bridges of Madison County.  Oh, my.  The Bridges of Madison County.  Hey, when you cross them, they will sing to you.  There may be troubled waters below them, but above there's the moon.  Bam, bam, bam.  I made that up. 
[01:58:30]  I didn't think there was a Bridges song.  No, there wasn't.  I make up theme songs to shows that don't have anything.  I was in a movie theater with a bunch of other couples, and every guy was like this, with  their arms folded, pissed off that they were there.  I know.  Well, you know, I have to tell you one thing.  I love Meryl Streep.  She's one of my favorites on the whole world.  She was pretty great.  She really was.  She's a good actress.  The problem is when she was looking from the window at Clint Eastwood bathing.  Yeah, when he's out by the pump and his shirt is off.  I've seen it once.  I didn't go back and see it again.  I think she's great, but you know what?  I'm not a big Clint Eastwood fan, so I thought he was going to whip out a gun and kill her anyway. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, well, I was hoping, I mean, anything, anything, anything.  She is the goddess of the fan.  I understand.  She is the goddess.  You cannot kill Meryl Streep, but I thought the combination was a little strange.  And then him, like, okay, I even watched it.  It took me three times.  I swear to God, I fell asleep every time, and then I'd have to pick up when the HBO showed  it the next time.  But I'm watching, and there's Clint Eastwood driving out to the bridges of Madison County  to take pictures because he's a photographer, and it was like done in real time. 
[01:59:30]  He's setting up the chute.  He's driving.  He's looking at the bridge.  He's taking the pictures.  Did I put my film in your refrigerator?  Is that sexual?  And that was it.  I mean, I was really trying to...  Well, I give you credit.  You tried.  It's not a great movie, believe me.  I don't think it's a great movie, and it's a retarded book.  Everybody read it.  It was the worst book in the world.  Reading.  Not everyone read that.  No, well, I did.  Okay, what's the current...  Reading, Paul.  What are the current chick flicks?  No, all right, anything. 
[02:00:00]  That was it.  Over the past five years, with Richard Gere in it.  You know what?  Can't.  Can't do...  What the hell was autumn friggin'...  And she dies in the end.  Goddamn death movie.  Yeah, it's a die.  That was the last chick flick I saw.  What about What Women Want?  I won't go see that.  I don't care.  No, I'll be sure.  I saw What Women Want.  How was it?  It was all right.  It was a good comedy.  Oh, I don't think it was a chick flick.  No, okay.  Well, all right.  But the title is chickish flickish.  Yeah.  Kind of.  Yeah.  Sort of like Natsuki.  It's no... 
[02:00:30]  That was chick flick.  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  It's no...  I mean, chick flick.  It's like Fried Green Tomatoes.  Those are the movies.  Oh, yeah.  You know...  Well...  Steel Magnolias.  Steel Magnolias.  Steel Magnolias, right.  Steel Magnolias is actually very good.  Very good movie.  Really busting apart those stereotypes.  Very good movie.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Explain to us why Steel Magnolias is a good movie.  Because...  I want to understand, Mario.  As ridiculous as Sally Field is, and as much as she pisses me off on Inside the Actors  Studio with James Lipton, she's like, when I do an emotional scene, I take imaginary 
[02:01:00]  razor blades and cut myself up inside.  Get out of your mind!  This is why these Strasburg actors are all crazy, because they have to live it.  Stella Adler said, do it and move on!  And don't take it home with you, Sally!  Did you take your nun hat home with you and fly around your friggin' house?  She was great at the Convin Santanko.  She was.  I love that.  Oh, she was awesome with the way she...  And Sister Patrille, the mother...  Sister Patrille.  Sister Patrille, I heard you were flying around the Belfry today. 
[02:01:30]  Please, sit there.  Yeah, the gust of wind would go, and she'd be up by the blue belt.  And that compulsive gambler that you're hanging with.  Carlos.  Carlos Santango.  I can't...  First of all, anyway, Sally Field gives a great performance in that movie, and Julia  Roberts is one of my favorites.  I think...  Do you like her?  Oh, I love her!  She's awesome!  I think she's beautiful and talented.  We're disagreeing with her.  But you know what?  We're still friends.  Right.  And that's appropriate that we can disagree and agree at the same time. 
[02:02:00]  But look, there's a lot of chick flicks that I don't like either, but there's a lot of  guy flicks.  Like, I cannot do the Schwarzenegger thing.  I don't care about...  No.  I don't care about...  And you don't...  Fucking Nazis.  I just swore again.  He's a big Nazi.  Because I don't care about his effing Nazi ass.  I said it twice today.  I'm so sorry.  I apologize to all of you.  Now we're having fun.  Now we're having fun.  I apologize to Jarrett Hall and contact and... 
[02:02:30]  I'm the party pooper.  Now you were saying during commercials that you son of a bitch.  Oh, Arnold, get back at you.  That was him.  That was pretty clean, Arnold.  You don't...  You don't like the little kid from Sixth Sense.  First of all, don't nominate him for an Academy Award.  I thought he should have won it.  He was great, but don't torture the kid he lost.  He was devastated.  Then, on the Golden Globes, he was ridiculous.  He was like, I just want to say to Billy Elliot that good job.  You're paying it forward now, aren't you?  Oh, God. 
[02:03:00]  He was like, Stepford Child Star.  It's very scary.  It is creepy.  It's slick.  It is.  You know, the Child Star.  There was a great documentary on Child Stars on A&E that I watched.  It was very interesting.  You know, they were all Patty Duke and everybody was crying.  Well, the Paul Piedis and Support Group.  You know about the Paul Piedis?  Right, right.  Which, you know...  Oh, there's a story in...  Is it the Enquirer?  I was just reading the office.  Little Johnny Whitaker.  Remember Little Johnny Whitaker?  Tom Sawyer?  Family affair?  I love you.  Of course.  Little Johnny Whitaker.  He's bloated and retaining now, but I still like him. 
[02:03:30]  What happened?  He's busted in a porno theater in one of the little rooms.  Whacking it.  Whacking it.  Was he?  Yeah.  Okay, here it is.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Buffy!  Jody!  Mr. Frank!  Johnny Whitaker made a great movie called...  It was a musical version of Tom Sawyer that was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  Do you remember the Christmas special where he played the kid who died and went to heaven?  Yes, I do.  Because it fell off the cliff.  It was The Littlest Thing.  The Littlest Angels.  The Littlest Angels.  I sure do. 
[02:04:00]  Little Johnny Whitaker.  Now he's spanking it in a goddamn peep shop.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a problem.  He said he beat the crack cocaine, which he was doing for quite a while.  Now he just beats himself.  Is that why?  And then he beats himself.  They all do crack cocaine.  They love the crack cocaine, but he said he can't get off of the kinky sex.  He's into bondage, sadomasochist.  Little Johnny Whitaker.  Well, you know...  The Littlest Angel.  Remember that?  I thought that was the most morbid special.  Even as a kid, he's reaching for a butterfly or something on Christmas, I think it was, and he falls off a cliff. 
[02:04:30]  There he is.  There's his picture.  Little Johnny Whitaker.  Oh, he looks...  No, he looks like Grandpa Walton.  He got really old.  What happened?  I've beaten crack cocaine, but I'm hooked on kinky sex.  Well...  He loves it.  That's okay.  He says he has sex now with a bunch of strangers over the internet.  How can you type with one hand?  Imagine...  I don't get it.  I don't get what the...  Imagine you're hooked up with somebody, and you're like, hey, you're little Johnny Whitaker.  What a surprise. 
[02:05:00]  He's had many families.  One writing in.  Mario was on TV showing the world his apartment.  Asked him about his little weed smoking room.  Ah, sweet!  It's my Instagram room!  Yeah, I have a little loft.  I have two floors, and then in between I have this loft area where I have kind of a little guest room.  There you go.  And I don't have a box.  Look, let me tell you something.  You smoke pot in your living room, okay?  I don't need a room.  Excuse me, hold on. 
[02:05:30]  Look, it's Jill Clayberg throwing up.  She's coughing.  You don't cough when you throw up, Jill.  Cut!  You didn't get the Oscar.  It's called a callback in the business.  That's right.  That was a good one.  Yeah, I did, but I had a little room.  But I don't smoke my pot.  Get your pot out!  I'm going to Amsterdam again, the end of April, speaking of...  Really?  You bet you sweet.  Hey, what would carbon sound like smoking pot?  People...  You guys, I am so relaxed right now. 
[02:06:00]  Can I get a cookie, please, ma'am?  Ma'am, can I get a cookie?  I want a scooter.  Ma'am, can I get a cookie, please, ma'am?  Oh, sweet.  Everything looks so carnival.  Look, you guys.  Costa Rican prostitutes. 
[02:06:30]  I'm so happy.  I feel like I'm floating.  That's an episode.  That is an episode.  Oh, yeah.  We rarely clap for a guest.  Okay.  We got to take a quick break.  Mario's got to go.  I got to go.  Oh, you got to leave.  I got to take off.  I got to make dinner day, but I'm coming back.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I hate myself.  I'm so bad.  I had a great time. 
[02:07:00]  Definitely.  You guys are really...  Anytime, man.  I'm a blast.  Good night.  You guys are great.  Got a really good instant feedback here from Vinny from Rosedale, who helps with the show  every day.  Hey, guys, I have a new nickname for your stalkers.  Why are you looking at me?  Because you look right at me all the time.  You don't want me to come in here anymore.  I won't come in here. 
[02:07:30]  Man, we're freaking out.  We live in...  We didn't invite you.  Oh, leave him alone.  He's a celebrity.  He's hanging out with the Sopranos cast tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  You're at the Rock and Roll Cafe, wherever you are, on Monday.  Let's back up.  You said...  We didn't even invite you.  You just showed up.  You act like we invite you, and then we're...  No, you didn't invite me.  Rick needed cars, so I came by.  Is that okay with you?  One more plug, right?  That's all I need?  1-800-GO-VITAL?  Yeah, why don't you go home now?  Oh, now you owe us another car, because that's four plugs. 
[02:08:00]  He acts like we invited him, and then we're treating him like crap.  No, you just showed up.  And then you're surprised when we trashed you.  I'm not allowed anymore.  I used to be.  Anyway, Anthony, Vinny from Rosedale.  Yes.  Hey, guys, I have a new nickname for your stalkers, and he lists all the stalkers.  Mm-hmm.  Stalker Patty, Lady Di, Marion, and Limo Anthony.  Vinny.  You have made the stalker category.  Come to the road show tomorrow night.  Shut up.  Come say hello to me.  The new nickname for...  Come say hello to me.  For our stalkers, Anthony. 
[02:08:30]  You ready for this one?  Yeah.  How about the retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley?  That could work.  Oh, my God.  The disgusting retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley.  I'm in.  Angels, I have a mission for you.  Discuss Opie and Anthony at all costs, all the time, forever, forever, ever.  Anthony.  Hey, guys, what's happening? 
[02:09:00]  That Anthony from Vinyl, he don't need you guys no more.  You know, he's a big shot.  He's going on other shows on WNEW, plugging his show.  What other show you go on?  The sports guys called me the other morning.  That's okay.  They called me, brother.  They called me.  I didn't call them.  Did I say...  Well, now, you know, now you don't need them anymore.  That's not true.  You know, you're a big tough guy.  You're getting loud with them.  That's all right.  Opie's letting you...  You know, he's giving you enough room to hang yourself.  What's your name?  Doesn't matter if you want my name.  You can come see me at the road show tomorrow night, too. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Come see me.  Do you want to beat people up?  Because we'll make that happen on the stage.  We'll have a punching booth.  All right.  People can just come in and punch you.  You don't have a bad ankle.  I'll try my best.  No.  You want people just to come on stage and beat you up?  No.  Listen, because you know what?  I won't come there by myself.  I'll come there with, like, 40 people I know, and we'll all pummel you together.  There you go.  Bring it on.  We need, like...  Can we, like...  I don't know.  We need to do something with him.  I tell you, hang out with...  Can we shoot paintballs at you on stage?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, you can shoot paintballs at me.  I need a paintball company. 
[02:10:00]  Well, wait a minute.  Well, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You said yes.  But I...  Am I protected at all?  Like, you guys...  Wait.  You get goggles and a cup.  That's it.  You're so cocky.  We're going to shoot the paintballs at you.  Shoot paintballs at me.  Shoot paintballs at me.  And he has no blow.  Dude, he doesn't.  You have no idea.  How far away?  No, I don't.  Actually, I've never been shot.  It doesn't matter.  We could shoot you at 200 yards.  You'd still hurt.  Still going to hurt?  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  It'll hurt a lot.  You, um...  Do you want...  Well, you know, you're the one that...  It's up to you guys.  You don't like me in here anymore.  If I get a free pass from now on and come in here whenever I want... 
[02:10:30]  We didn't invite you.  You'll be very injured.  My last gun did 125 feet per second.  It hurts.  It hurts, man.  Did you see Jackass?  No.  Did you see what his legs looked like?  No.  It raised welts the size of half dollars, and they were black.  Forget about it.  I don't feel like getting maimed.  If you're going to go far enough, I'll...  You got to know what you're getting into.  Oh, you're a pussy.  I knew it.  Only in the butt.  In the ass?  Yeah.  You act all brave on the radio.  You're a pussy.  I'll take it.  We'll do it. 
[02:11:00]  How many shots?  How many shots?  20.  Absolutely not.  You're an ass.  How about a game of asses up at the Rojo?  He goes how many shots?  You know what?  One shot would do it.  So then you know what?  He would cry like a little girl.  You know what?  I bet you I won't.  John, what's up?  Yeah, this guy...  The other day, I was looking to the sports guy.  I thought to him every day.  And he's on there.  And they had some guy who was coming in who was going to be all drunk and hammered.  Madden.  Because he hadn't drunk for God knows how long.  But he was there.  And he said, oh, you know what?  I'll do you guys a favor. 
[02:11:30]  I'll drive this guy home.  I'll give him my limo.  And he was plugging his company out the ass.  I'm allowed.  They called me.  You got a problem with that?  No, they didn't call you.  You were there.  How do you know they didn't call me?  6.30 in the morning, they woke me up out of sleep.  All right, scum?  Whatever, man.  You're a sea dump truck.  All right, scum.  All of a sudden, he turned into T.J. Hooker.  I know.  Look how brave you are.  Okay, scum.  No, but he doesn't know the facts.  You're busted, scum.  They woke me up at 6.30 in the morning.  I don't care if they're on a show.  You don't have fun with them. 
[02:12:00]  You're busted, scum.  They put on a good show.  I don't care.  You know what?  So what are you trying to say?  You don't want me here to go with them?  You don't add anything to our show.  Hold on.  Maybe they'll have better luck.  Dan from Hoboken.  Of course, Rick wants to do asses up.  God damn, Dan.  Let me get Psycho Mark on the air.  Psycho Mark.  Have you talked to your doctor about Stacker 2?  Hey, there it is.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Dude, I got my paintball gun.  I'm going to freeze some paintballs, 
[02:12:30]  and I'll have that thing shooting around 300 feet per second.  He ain't doing it.  It'll leave wealth on his back like grapefruit, you know?  I got my paintball gun.  Jack, Jack, Jack.  He's backing out now.  Five shots.  I'll give you five shots.  You are such a wimp.  Why don't you stand like a man and take 20 shots right in the sack?  You know what?  Okay.  I'll take shots.  He said he'll take five shots.  Five shots will do the trick.  Yeah, but from how far away?  I know you'll be point blank. 
[02:13:00]  You'll put it on my skin and shoot me.  Not only that, Mark has, like, the top-of-the-line paintball gun.  Yeah.  This thing is, like...  You have never been hit...  Five shots, I'll do it.  Have you ever been hit by a paintball gun?  No, I have not.  I'll do it.  You're so stupid.  See, this guy, Dan from Jersey, is a genius.  He actually has a solution.  Why not kill two birds with one stone?  Put the hair paint in the paintball guns and shoot Limo Anthony in the head.  So it'll stick.  All right, guys.  We'll see you later.  All right.  People coming up with ideas for you.  And we want to do one of these ideas tomorrow night. 
[02:13:30]  Doug from Springfield.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey.  Hey, Doug.  Perfect thing for Limo Anthony.  Yeah.  Human dartboard.  No.  Oh, come on.  But you can round off the edge of the darts a little bit.  Can't throw some darts at you?  All right.  Those big lawn darts.  How's that?  Hold on.  We'll make a deal.  What's a kill?  Doug, you're on to something.  I'm going to hang up on you because we need to do some wheeling and dealing.  Okay.  Bye.  I wasn't even coming tomorrow night.  Listen.  I wasn't.  Listen.  Go ahead.  You need plugs for your stupid business, right?  Yeah.  That is floundering.  It's not floundering. 
[02:14:00]  It's doing very well.  It's the only reason you're here and the only reason you're starting to call the sports guys.  Let's be honest.  Okay.  You're wrong.  If you become a human dartboard.  Go ahead.  We could negotiate here.  Okay.  Plugs for darts.  Plugs for darts.  Right, Ant?  What are we going to do, though?  Actually throw darts into them?  Yeah.  We'll protect your spine.  Oh, thanks.  I've seen this done before.  Yeah.  But it's done by those guys that put the block heads, that put the nails in their nose,  and put the vice grips on their nipples and whatnot. 
[02:14:30]  You really want to hurt me?  No.  I want to see you, you know.  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry?  I just want to see you jump around in pain for a little bit.  I'll do the paintballs.  I'll do the paintballs.  I don't think they're going to allow that, though, obviously.  Yeah.  Darts, though.  Very easy.  We can do it here.  Now.  How about you take one from a potato gun?  That could kill them.  A potato gun. 
[02:15:00]  So, I think it's just going to be nice to me.  It just goes over the edge.  I'll take the darts.  You'll take the darts?  I'll take one dart.  How could you take a dart?  I'll put it.  Do I get to protect myself in all my vital areas?  Ben, you want to be loved.  Vital areas.  You want to be loved so bad.  I actually didn't mean to lie.  Shut up, Ben.  He wants to be loved so bad.  I'm surprised he'll come in here with a bandage and an eye patch.  You'll take darts?  I'm not even allowed in here.  My girlfriend.  Never mind.  Your girlfriend won't allow you in here?  Why?  She thinks you're over the edge. 
[02:15:30]  Oh.  Hey, we got some darts right now.  Well, when she becomes of age, she'll understand what the show's all about.  She's 24.  Here, I got darts right now.  We don't have to wait for the road show.  All right.  Let me see one of those.  Oh, my God.  For each dart that hits your back, we'll plug your web.  Absolutely not.  Why?  One plug?  That's nothing.  No.  There's four darts.  Ant gets two, I get two.  Give me one of those.  Let me see how the tips are.  They're not even that sharp, man.  Look.  What's that?  Feel. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, that's nothing.  These things are worn down.  And you said you had a hairy back.  You got enough protection.  You barely get a quarter inch in you.  Here's the deal.  Go ahead.  Here's the deal.  For each dart we throw, we plug your company.  Okay?  If we get one to stick, which is possible, and a stick is like it sticks and then falls  out, five plugs.  Five plugs for your company.  Get out of here.  Look at what you're aiming at.  What do you think?  Why?  Let's do it.  We'll do it?  Yeah.  Let me go get...  All right.  Someone's got to...  Honestly, someone's got... 
[02:16:30]  Whoa!  I aim for the wood.  I hit the wood.  Don't throw in the door back.  Did you see?  Look at the mark on the wood.  I know you do.  I aim for that, my friend.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Because this guy needs plugs bad.  I don't need plugs.  Fine.  Listen.  Listen.  No.  Rick, you got to listen.  We need to figure out how to protect the spine.  That is really crucial.  Spine.  Gee, thanks.  Just the spine.  These aren't even going to go in.  They're too blunt.  You got any hammerheads?  Mine, yeah.  Of course.  Mine's going in.  Yours is going in. 
[02:17:00]  Find something to protect his spine.  We'll take a break, and you're going to take darts to the back, right?  Next.  I'll take darts to the back.  All right.  What?  If it hits a rib, he could get quite an infection in the bone.  Who cares?  It's him.  Well, I know.  That is not nice.  Why?  Why?  What have I ever done to you?  Trust me.  I will take great pleasure in this.  Wow.  I could get his pinky.  God damn it, he's tall.  I could hit his pinky from here.  Mitch from Survivor's here.  He's got to be 7'4".  Oh, my God.  He's...  Wow. 
[02:17:30]  Is he going to throw one at me, too?  We forgot to tell everyone.  Mitch from Survivor.  Yes.  Australian Outback is here.  And Stephen Lynch is here.  He just showed up.  Ah.  And we're throwing darts at you next.  Finally, we've got a show.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, you probably shouldn't go for his back.  You might hurt something.  But the place you could go for is throw him right at his ass.  Why not his back?  I'm a little worried about the back, too.  Yeah, you got it.  What if we kill him?  Just if we paralyze him and he's still rolling in in a wheelchair going,  Hey, no, I don't take it personally, guys. 
[02:18:00]  You know, it's cool.  I still like you.  You need anything?  All right, Keith.  Let's see if he's up for that.  See you, sir.  All right.  Listen.  On a respirator.  We're going to have to throw him at your ass like Game of Ass is up.  I'm not happy about it, and I'm sure you're not.  But it's safer that way.  Shoot for Cork.  Who's going to shoot for Cork?  You're going to have to pull your pants down.  No, no, no, no.  Absolutely not.  You got to.  No.  Like, we're going to enjoy that.  Hold on.  I'm having a hard time just listening to Opie Escalimo Anthony just pull his pants down. 
[02:18:30]  It's got.  No.  The darts will go right through the pants.  They'll go right through my skin.  You're going to be covered up.  Get a grip.  It's either this cloth or none at all.  No.  The back.  If we're doing the back, then you got to take your shirt off.  I know I'm not happy with this, but we're not throwing it through a suit.  No, no.  Not a jacket.  What's wrong with the shirt?  No.  I'll take the shirt off.  I got a T-shirt.  It's got to be the back.  Just bare back?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  No.  All right.  No plugs. 
[02:19:00]  I don't get plugs anyway.  You'll never get another plug.  Never get a plug.  It's not like it's armor.  Because now you're backing out.  Everyone was counting on, you know, hearing you get darts to the back.  And now you're, like, you know, fooling around with the rules of the game.  And help me out here.  Come on, Ant.  What, bare back?  Yeah, it has to be bare back.  What's the difference between bare back and a shirt?  You have the record for the most wine bottles.  You think it'll hurt more?  I don't think it's going to effing matter.  Tell you the truth.  Once it goes through the shirt, which it will, it's the same thing. 
[02:19:30]  It's not like it's armor.  You're going to hurt me.  You just got to throw it harder.  Make sure it goes through.  Because Steve's trying to get video for the website.  It'll just be a...  I don't want that on the website.  Whatever.  No plugs ever.  Ever.  Ever.  We'll even change the codes.  We usually change the codes when we, like, fire someone.  We'll just change them.  So this is it.  Either I walk out and never be with you guys again,  or I have to get darts thrown on my bare back.  Yeah.  Darts on the bare back.  T-shirt.  This guy's saying that he threw darts at his friend and punctured his kidney. 
[02:20:00]  You got two.  That rocks.  This is just...  Rocks.  It does rock.  This is just reminiscent of Eddie Haskell and Lumpy.  I swear to God.  Come on, B.  Lumpy is Eddie Haskell.  What kind of...  And poor Anthony is Lumpy.  What kind of...  What kind of...  To use the term from yesterday, Anthony, what kind of underpants do you have?  Boxers?  No.  I'm disturbed.  Pains.  See, I don't want to see that either.  I don't want you to see it.  If you had the boxers, it was doable, right? 
[02:20:30]  Garrett?  Right.  Stinky.  Oh, my God.  Trying to call you by your real name.  It's a little weird.  I know.  All right, Anthony.  I'm just saying, whatever he wants to do, shirt or no shirt, I mean...  Shirt's got to be off.  Because we've got to make sure we're not hitting your spine or anything crazy.  Oh, for that reason?  Well, that's good then.  Okay, yeah.  So that way we can pick our target.  No, because I want to see him topless.  No, I just thought because you wanted it to hurt more.  But I'm just thinking it'll hurt the same.  Once it goes through the shirt, it's over.  And it'll just be funny to see his stupid hairy back. 
[02:21:00]  And you don't want to ruin your shirt.  Exactly.  There's so many laughs involved with this.  No, I mean, it's just to regret on you for two and a half years to get me back.  I'm going to enjoy this.  I know you will.  And we're going to do it next.  So get ready.  Do we have the spine protector?  So now we're going just back?  Oh, he's taking the shirt off.  No, don't take the shirt off until we're ready.  What kind of spine protector is that?  Dude, you're giving us a lot of credit.  That thing's just as thick as his spine. 
[02:21:30]  Wait a minute.  Any deviation either way.  And he's still apt.  You know what?  Five plugs is not enough.  I want unlimited plugs whenever I can.  Like Louis Black.  No.  Come on.  I've done a lot.  It's not like you got arrested.  We're just going to throw a dart at you.  You know, come close.  Louis Black was in a jail cell for 28 hours or whatever it was.  You know that.  But you did it.  Almost.  All right.  See, you've got to understand.  You don't do this.  No plugs ever.  You do this.  You get lots of plugs today. 
[02:22:00]  And then you'll be known as the dart guy.  What about plugs in the future?  Possibly.  Always have my mic on at all times?  Annoying laugh, dart guy.  No, we cannot agree to having your mic on at all times.  It has to be a mic on at all times.  Oh, yeah.  Because you always shut it off.  No, you're playing with the rules.  We're on.  All right.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on. 
[02:22:30]  This show is turning out to be better than yesterday.  Remember what that guy said earlier?  He said we should go home because we're not going to beat yesterday's show.  We took on the challenge, and it's shaping up to be a good one today.  Is that your dart-throwing music?  Yeah.  Good.  I love the crows.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Wait.  I want to say something to you.  I want to say something to you.  We'll get to you in a second.  See what I'm saying, Mitch? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand that.  Constant attention is needed.  How long would he have lasted on the island?  Oh, man.  Hard to say.  A day.  Maybe a day.  No.  If he was the one that fell in the fire, they'd have left him in there.  That's it.  Ouch.  More hated than the hell.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  He could have turned into Lord of the Flies.  He could have heated the whole camp with that blubber.  Sorry, sushi boy. 
[02:23:30]  Whatever.  Whatever.  Imagine him running after the pig instead of Mike to feed everyone on the island.  He would have gone hungry.  Catch you.  Oh, man.  All right.  As you can hear, Anthony is sharpening.  Wait a minute.  Sharpening the darts.  Anthony's been sharpening the darts for, I don't know, since we started commercials.  Let me feel it.  Let me feel.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that's a dart. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  Here.  Give him to Stank so he could sterilize him.  These things had been blunted for a while.  Wait.  I'll get to you in a second.  I'm going around the room.  You're last.  Stephen Lynch is in the studio, Anthony.  Need a limo?  Say.  Oh, God.  Wait a minute.  Hey.  I could capitalize on this.  You have to put a tarp in the back seat so the blood spurring from your orifices doesn't fit all over me.  Oh, here's a, we got some tape of the limo pulling up to pick up Stephen. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  That doesn't sound like a limo, but what the hell?  Maybe it is.  Also, Mike DiNicola in the studio.  We haven't seen him in a while.  Very nice to meet you.  Where have you been, man?  I was on the road.  On the road?  I was doing all the horrible radio spots.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Green Bay?  Yeah.  Murphy.  Murphy in the morning.  Is that where they just go, you know, they say, hey, Mike DiNicola's in the studio, and then they want you to be funny for ten straight minutes, 
[02:25:00]  and then they have to cut you off because they have a weather break?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  It was the really angry guy who's been there for 40 years, and he's got the two sidekicks that hate him.  Let's go to the weather.  It's going to be cold.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So what do you think about the pack?  Oh, they look good.  They look good.  Yeah, they sure do.  They sure do.  I've been a cheesehead for years.  But you're being too genial.  They're really angry at each other. 
[02:25:30]  You walk into the studio, and it feels like you're in trouble.  Like, why does everybody hate each other?  Oh, really?  Like, Mommy and Daddy have been fighting?  Yeah.  Because they've been stuck in Green Bay for 40 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the two sidekicks were young, and they were cool.  But the Murphy guy was just this evil, hateful guy.  That's always the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he was like, so, why don't you just be funny?  Do you think you can handle that?  And I'm like, I don't need this at 6.30 in the morning.  So what did you say?  Yeah.  How much do you make?  And what does your wife look like?  Right?  Yeah.  I bet. 
[02:26:00]  That's always a good one.  That's a good comeback.  That shuts right up my C. Nicola.  We learned that today.  Also in studio, Mitch from Survivor.  Hey.  The 7-foot white guy.  Right.  Right, right.  Great way to describe.  Well, you know, an ex-Harlem Globetrotter hopeful.  Yeah.  Yeah, we learned that about him so far.  That's a good way to intro him.  Yeah.  Also, annoying laugh, Anthony, from Top Notch Limousines. 
[02:26:30]  Need a town call, Mitch?  I may.  I may.  I'll have to get your card.  Oh, once you got the card, you're done.  It's a tracking device.  He actually put an electronic tracking device in his cards when he gives them out.  I know where you are.  If you take him up on his offer, just, like, make sure he picks you up about a block or two  from your house.  Okay.  That is so wrong.  Anthony on the phone, what's up?  Hey, Limo Anthony, you douche dyke.  I got a question for you.  Thank you, sir.  You want to have an update?  Your website still says Open Anthony FM Talks. 
[02:27:00]  I know, I know.  It's okay.  FM Talks?  He's been there for two years.  I've been working with him for two and a half years.  I don't have time.  That means I'm busy.  Oh, yeah.  What did you make your website on?  MyFirstAOLWebpage.com?  You told me.  Microsoft.  Hey, that's good.  Get up in the aisle.  Bleacher creatures, baby.  All right, cool.  Look at everything he's got on his website for Top Notch Limo.  A home about us, special events, vehicles, reservations, rates, references, corporate accounts,  email us, and links.  Serious emails only, people. 
[02:27:30]  So, here it is.  Top Notch Limo.  You know what?  Don't do that, because they're going to just bang it out now.  Imagine yourself and your guests being whisked away for an elegant evening in a prestigious  limousine.  Well, then call someone else other than Top Notch Limo.  On your way to your special occasion.  We cater to your special day at Top Notch Limousine.

Well-groomed, you're losing your hair. 
[02:28:00]  You got back hair.  I'm not the driver!  And big sweat stains on your arms.  What are you doing?  Giving out Yankee Crankies in the back of that thing?  I'm not the driver!  You're a jerk.  Top Notch can and will fulfill any of your transportation needs.  Let us take you into the new millennium in the style you deserve.  Top Notch limousine is the official transportation company of the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, it is?  Oh, really?  Oh, it's not that.  It's not.  It's not.  No, it's not.  Okay.  Are these retroactive plugs right here?  Coming soon.  Top Notch Calendar Girls and Top Notch Sports Picks for your entertainment pleasure. 
[02:29:00]  That's about a year ago.  That was a year ago.  That's what we do in a calendar contest.  Yeah, all right.  You know what?  Are the darts ready?  Because I can't wait anymore.  Top Notch Limo.  We have tires.  Bill, what's up?  What's going on, man?  It's just like, oh, my God.  Bill.  Yo.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Hey.  What are you guys doing?

[02:30:00]  No talking to the driver.  And you got porno links on there.  No.  Well, Hot Show.  The link is on there.  It's supposed to be gone.  By the way, Stephen Lynch will be playing some new songs for us on the show today after  we get done with you.  Done with me?  Are we ready?  Where's the darts?  Where's Stinky?  Stinky.  Who's got the poison tip darts?  Well, that's a good question.  This is sick.  I'm begging you to turn his mic on.  Isn't this wrong? 
[02:30:30]  What was it?  I'm begging you to turn his mic on.  I know it.  And I said, get off the site.  That's what I said.  Your mic's on.  No, it's not.  Get off the site.  Let me tell you, you can't even get to Top Notch Limousine right now.  TopNotchLimo.com.  It's getting pounded.  It's getting pounded.  Hey, Stink.  Grab his mic for a minute.  What do we do to sterilize?  You threw a pen at me, Anthony.  Good job.  I got two effing darts.  I'm going to hurl at your back.  The pen really hurt.  Ooh.  Go.  We burned them with a Bic lighter and then rubbed them down with alcohol. 
[02:31:00]  Steril.  Thank you, Doctor.  Steril.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  I think we're ready.  Yes.  I imagine everyone understands what's going on here.  Annoying Laugh Anthony will be removing that sweat-stained shirt of his.  He'll be facing a wall and we're throwing darts at his butt.  You are just a cruel human being.  I know and I love it.  You are just the worst.  You just gave me a great compliment.  Thank you.  I know that.  You know it, too.  And you love to see other people.  All right.  So Randy's telling me to double in, double out, but I think I'm just going to shoot for cork. 
[02:31:30]  Shoot for cork.  Hit me with your best shot.  All right.  Listen.  So here's the deal.  For every dart that hits you in the...  How many darts are we allowed to throw at you?  Four.  Just four?  That's it?  Yes.  You sure?  Yes.  Okay.  For every dart that hits your back, you get a plug.  No.  And whatever...  No.  No.  And anything that sticks, I get ten plugs.  Sticks?  No, five.  You can't change the rules now.  I heard five.  You're a talking hand now, right?  I heard five.  Now we're talking hands.  What are you doing?  Go home. 
[02:32:00]  It's hurt.  All right.  Turn the stinky cam around.  Where's Anthony going to stand?  He's going to stand over there.  So I want our listeners to be able to see this.  Stand against the wall.  Where are you going to be standing, Anthony?  Are we micing him?  Turn your...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I think it's time to get up.  All right.  Well, let him stand there.  And then, Rick, adjust the camera quickly so I can take a look and make sure it's okay.  I'm good.  I used to be on a league, man.  Hey, hey, hey.  Of course, it was after like 12 beers before the first game started.  I don't know how I played sober.  All right.  Take your shirt off. 
[02:32:30]  No.  Stand just like this.  No.  No.  We got to make sure we don't hit the spine.  That's the only reason.  Look at you.  God.  Look at you.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Make sure you mic him because the noise, that's going to come out of him.  These are really sharp now.  I love it.  All right.  Are we ready?  Who's going to?  Wait, wait, wait.  Me and you got to get odds or evens for who takes the first shot.  One, two, three.  My bad.  Oh, you bastard.  All right.  Hank goes first. 
[02:33:00]  You're going to throw from there?  Yeah.  This is like a pretty legit distance.  All right.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  Come around.  We should give the visual.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's give the visual here.  The tool is against the wall.  The tool?  I'm going to be a tool.  You know, I would avoid turning around like that all the time.  Yeah, I know.  He keeps winging his head around.  Hey, to make sure you don't get that I mentioned.  My eye!  Okay, his spine is covered. 
[02:33:30]  But is it really covered?  I'm seeing like a little out of that left side.  I could probably take out his foot.  Yeah, there is.  I think I see the nerve that goes to his foot.  Anthony, vertebraes 7 and 12 are exposed.  Okay, Anthony gets...  Stop moving.  Turn around and ask you back.  Okay, and I'm going to get a double lumbar for out.  No, don't bend down. 
[02:34:00]  That's good.  Maybe we can arc it in.  Anthony, move closer.  No, this is how far a regulation dartboard is.  All right, go ahead.  And...  Remember, if it doesn't hit your back, you don't get the plug.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Is he bleeding?  Oh, there's a hole in his t-shirt.  Come on, man!  All right.  That was a great shot, man.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:30]  I put that right in the shoulder blade.  All right, wait.  Right in the effing shoulder blade.  All right, three to go.  This should be good.  Opie's pitching.  Opie!  Wait, he gets a plug for that.  I forgot where I work the pain.  Vital transportation, 1-800-GO-VITAL.  God, you are a puss, right?  You're taking the mic.  All right, Opie.  Opie's pitching from the Little League mound, so this one's going to hurt a lot more.  Yeah, Opie is really close.  Oh, God.  No, because I know what he's saying.  No, don't turn around like that, Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  You've got to put an eye out.  Don't stop it.  I'm very injured.  Oh, move your head.  Rick's pretty close, too.  Opie!  Wait, I want to go for this.  No!  Don't, don't.  All right.  That's a tough shot, though.  It's a little low.  You suck.  Oh, he nailed him in the love handle.  Man, he nailed me right in the love handle, man.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I know. 
[02:35:30]  This is the most fun you can ever have.  You see that dart bounce off that light handle?  I get a plug, right?  Yeah, you get a plug.  It didn't even stick in.  Top-notch limousines.  It's 516-756-1663.  Oh, look at you.  Radio voice.  Shut up.  Make it stick.  Make it stick.  Come on.  $10 if it sticks.  No!  No!  Firehook!  Come on, Ed.  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:36:00]  Oh!  It's caught!  It's caught!  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're fine.  Ask the room officially for that one.  Wow.  No.  No.  It caught, but it didn't stick.  We have blood.  We have blood.  We've got blood.  You got one more.  You got one more.  That's tough.  You got blood.  You got blood.  Wait, wait, wait.  You get five plugs.  Oh, good.  What do you want to do?  You want to do them all in a box?  You want to spread them out?  He's bleeding.  I'm bleeding. 
[02:36:30]  I got to beat this shirt tonight.  Come on.  Yeah, there's a little.  Oh, my God.  He's bleeding.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  You can take a break.  You need to take a breather?  We got one more.  It's going to tattoo.  Oh, my God.  What a little tissue on.  Did you see it hang there for a couple of seconds before it fell out?  Briefly, it caught.  All right.  Oh, man.  He's worried about his T-shirt.  He has a little blood, and he needs it.  So get him in the same spot.  He needs the shirt tonight. 
[02:37:00]  It's already wrecked there.  What should I do, Sensei?  All right.  Leave my fat rolls alone.  How's the anticipation, Ant?  Not knowing when it's actually coming.  It's the worst in the world, I'm telling you right now.  Isn't that terrible?  Opie.  No.  Come on, Opie.  That's some really skillful shots here.  Opie, you can get...  Oh, look.  Do not look.  Come on.  Just wait.  Come on.  No.  Shut up.  Listen, Rick, shut up.  You'd make a great terrorist, Rick.  Shut up.  You will talk.  Shut up.  You don't know when it's coming.  Three, two, one. 
[02:37:30]  No.  Like when you go to throw the stick for the dog and he goes to chase it, even though you  didn't throw it.  I didn't throw it yet.  I have a...  What?  Go.  Can I get a request?  Yeah.  Can I get a regular character for the show?  What a tool.  What a tool.  All right, Rick.  Definitely on three this time, all right?  Count it down.  Count it down.  Three, two, one. 
[02:38:00]  Oh!  Oh!  No!  No!  Oh, man!  You winged that.  No way!  Did he get the same shot?  He drew blood.  I didn't draw blood and it didn't stick.  I didn't wing it.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Come here.  Come here.  Hold on.  You can slide all those mics over now.  Holy Jesus.  What happened?  Where'd he go?  Hold on.  Get him back in here. 
[02:38:30]  What did he get all mad at?  Get back in here.  He's coming back in here.  You drew blood.  I drew blood and he threw it really hard and it was two of us.  You threw it at the same time.  I didn't throw five of them at you.  Anthony, I swear to you, I did not throw another dart.  I threw two darts.  Who threw the other dart?  I don't know.  Someone else in the room.  Mitch.  It wasn't me.  Mitch.  He's blaming Mitch from Survivor Window.  I wanted to throw one.  I didn't get to.  Let me see.  Pull the shirt down so we can see the. 
[02:39:00]  No.  No, I'm serious.  Let me see.  It's a hole.  Let's see the actual wound.  Yeah, we got to see the actual wound.  I don't want to take my back.  Well, just pull the shirt up or something.  Let the prisoner go, Rick.  He is sweating.  There's beads of sweat.  You're free.  You're free.  You're probably sitting there while the phone's darts.  Two years went to hatred on me.  All right.  So how many plugs?  How many plugs?  I get ten plugs, and I'll pick and choose when I want to use them.  Oh.  Wait.  There was not ten.  Ten?  You got it.  There's no way.  Five.  Five for Anthony's stick in one. 
[02:39:30]  How many plugs have you done already?  Two.  Two.  So five plus the one I did, six.  And we'll give you an extra one for that other person that threw it at your butt.  So seven plugs.  Okay.  There you go.  Well done.  I, for one, am very impressed.  We will play those plugs on the Sunday night show.  Let's look at the back.  Wait.  We got to see the back.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Let's see a good shot of that back.  No.  Turn around.  I want to.  Turn around.  I got to see it.  I got to see it.  Not done.  How did it get through that?  Wait.  Let me see.  Let me see. 
[02:40:00]  Let me see.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That was a nice one.  Ah.  Ah.  And then Rick rips more hair out of his back with some duct tape.  Insult to injury.  The one I threw up?  Yeah.  Did you see the way it hung?  Yeah.  For a little bit and kind of went, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then fell out?  Did you see the mark?  Yeah.  That was a good one.  Look at how happy you are.  Did you see the mark?  It left a good one.  You just got two of them.  I will think about this for the next two months.  When I'm feeling down, I'm just going to start laughing like a little school. 
[02:40:30]  Isn't that great?  Something to just perk you up.  Yep.  Start a lead.  Bravo, Anthony.  So, Mitch, Survivor, who's a...  No.  We got Mitch from Survivor.  We got Steven Lynch.  Adelphi University.  Go Panthers.  Basketball.  There's one of my plugs.  Six left.  You're using that as one of your...  Yeah, it's my...  Oh, my God.  My alma mater.  Prista.  Hi.  I just have to say something. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  When I first started listening to the O&A show, I said, oh, you know, maybe they're a little  too sexist.  But now I have to say, all men and women on the Opie and Anthony show are created equal.  No, no, I think I got to change that.  I think the guys are treated worse than the girls lately.  Without a doubt.  Anthony, now, it's a good thing you didn't ruin that shirt.  Well, it might.  Where'd you get that?  This I got at, um...  I don't know.  Where?  It's Joseph Aboud.  Oh.  Five left. 
[02:41:30]  TJ, what's up?  This should be the only way people get plugs out now.  You got to get well with thoughts.  I agree.  That was kind of sick.  I agree.  All right, guys.  You got to see the blood on his T-shirt.  It sounded pretty painful out here.  You might want to, yeah, plug up the hole or something.  Yeah, put something over that.  Hey, Uncle John wants to know something.  Uncle John.  Yeah, I saw that.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, little Anthony.  I just got a question.  Hi, Uncle John.  How are you?  Shut up.  Pretty good, thanks.  One quick question for you. 
[02:42:00]  If I offer you a dozen plugs, will you take a lethal injection?  I'll do it.  All right, bro.  See you, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Brendan.  Brendan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You know in Full Metal Jacket, when they start whipping private piles with the bars of soap?  Yep.  Little Anthony, you know that these guys are not your friends, right?  I'm realizing that more and more by the day.  You know, it's funny.  They'll call me when I need something, but when I walk in here, they hate my guts. 
[02:42:30]  You're going to be tonight laying in bed, and you're going to start to cry.  Without a doubt.  I'm crying already.  You make me sad, bro.  I make myself sad sometimes.  Oh, God.  That's good.  Thank you.  All right.  Ant's been good, though.  You want anything?  You okay?  Yeah, I'm all right, Ant.  Nice to take him.  Now you'll finally talk to me after two years.  No, I just want to know, because you're very entertaining.  I want to know if you need anything to cover up your cut with that you got on your back,  or anything to eat.  I'm all right.  Something to drink.  I'm okay.  What are you getting at?  What are you getting at? 
[02:43:00]  I'm just trying to be nice to him.  Okay.  That's all.  You want a beer?  Yeah, I do want a beer.  What beer has we got?  What do you want, Ant?  I want a bud.  No, no.  The boy left.  I didn't say it.  I didn't say it.  It's close enough, man.  People all know what a bud means.  The boy plugs left.  The best part was just listening to you roping it in.  Knowing exactly what was going to happen.  Dude, it's a deal with the devil.  Greg, what's up?  You never get the wishes that are entitled to.  That you're entitled to. 
[02:43:30]  We're co-Satans.  Greg.  Hey, Greg?  Yeah.  What's up?  Man, what's the matter with that guy?  I don't know.  That guy is dumber than a bag of hammers.  Oh, Anthony, man, you've got to get your head examined.  Anthony's dart did stick to the back of a drawing laugh, Anthony.  I laid that in.  You know what that shot was?  When I'm trying to double out and I'm shooting the bottom of the board, I need a six, and  I was shooting for the three, so you try to lob it in.  That was it.  And it was a perfect, like, it had enough arc to it that it stuck in at a little bit 
[02:44:00]  of an angle and then ripped some flesh out as it tips back down.  I was very happy with that shot.  I was smiling when you were doing it.  I certainly was, but not as hard as I hope you was.  You really enjoyed it.  I love that stuff.  Especially with me.  God, I love that.  All right, good job.  Yeah, bravo.  You can pull the plugs to other times, right?  Anytime you're on, you can plug.  Right.  You've got four plugs left, and you use them wisely. 
[02:44:30]  You didn't read the contract.  There's a time limit, you know.  Thanks. </pre>
