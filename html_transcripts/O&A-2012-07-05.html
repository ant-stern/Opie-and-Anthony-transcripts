<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a heated discussion surrounding Chevy Chase's unprofessional conduct on the set of *Community*.  The hosts dissected leaked voicemails containing Chase's expletive-laden tirades against creator Dan Harmon, incorporating commentary from *Community* cast members Gillian Jacobs and Joel McHale, the latter providing numerous anecdotes about Chase's difficult personality and their shared, albeit unwitting, obsession with *Karate Dog*.  The segment also touched upon Chris Humphries' divorce demands from Kim Kardashian, requiring a public admission that their marriage was a publicity stunt.  This was followed by an in-studio appearance by Jeff Goldblum, described as "an odd dude," where they discussed his career and acting techniques.

The show then transitioned to a movie-actor association game, featuring a long list of actors including Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy, Gary Oldman, and many more,  which sparked anecdotal discussions about encounters with some of these celebrities.  This led to a segment dedicated to a tell-all book about Mimi Beardsley's alleged 18-month affair with John F. Kennedy, with the hosts reading graphic excerpts and using highly offensive language to describe the encounters and Beardsley herself.  They extensively speculated about JFK's personality and sexual behavior.  

The show then revisited the tumultuous in-studio appearance of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, highlighting the aggressive interference of his publicist, who vehemently controlled the conversation, focusing solely on promoting Abdul-Jabbar's book and his connection to Hillary Clinton.  This segment also included commentary on the publicist's subsequent banning from the building after similar incidents.  Kevin Smith was noted as being present during the interview.  The hosts then inexplicably shifted to Opie's peculiar habit of using his sock to clean up urine droplets from the toilet seat, prompting a lengthy and absurd discussion involving callers and co-hosts.  This bizarre interlude was briefly interrupted by a positive in-studio interview with Nicholas Cage, who discussed attending the opera, his feelings about being parodied on SNL, and his new movie *Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance*.  Cage also touched upon his environmental concerns and views on cloning.  He recounted a humorous anecdote about meeting religious leaders while in costume in London and shared that he doesn't watch his own movies.  The segment concluded with a "worst of 2012" segment featuring Uncle Paul,  whose inflammatory comments included highly inappropriate jokes about child molestation and the Jerry Sandusky trial, along with a phone call from author Bill Mushi, frequently interrupted by Uncle Paul.  This was followed by a recording of Rich Voss attempting a Neil Young song.

A subsequent segment featured Ice-T, promoting "The Art of Rap," marred by Opie repeatedly calling him "Ice Cube."  This was followed by a "worst of 2012" segment documenting the destruction of Sam's 12-inch television after losing a bet with Opie regarding Opie's attendance at a movie premiere.  The segment detailed the television's destruction by Iraq using a sledgehammer, along with extensive commentary on safety precautions and Sam's subsequent purchase of a 22-inch replacement from Walmart. A voicemail from Jim Norton featuring highly offensive language was also played during the broadcast.  Finally, the show repeatedly mentioned upcoming appearances by Nicolas Cage and Ice-T, among others.

[00:01:30]  Sam's TV gets destroyed  And more  But we'll start off with Chevy Chase  It's been a weird year for Chevy Chase  It's been a weird year for the show community on NBC  I'm a big fan of that  I hope you are as well  But Chevy Chase has been notoriously known  For not being the most pleasant person to work with  Or just a nice person in general  I don't know the guy personally  Maybe he is  But everybody who's worked with him  Seems to think this guy is a dick  We talked to Gillian Jacobs  Almost got that wrong  And Joel McHale from Community 
[00:02:00]  They're both from Community there  Talk about Chevy Chase  Plus a voicemail got leaked  By the creator of the show  Let's explore this right now  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012  So far  So how are things with  I'm just going to say with Chevy  Chevy's fine  Is he?  This is like the longest gig he's ever had  I think, right?  Yeah, it was only on SNL for a year  This is three years now  Wow  We're just waiting for one of them to tell the truth  To crack  And actually explain  Didn't someone tell us the truth once? 
[00:02:30]  Maybe  Yeah  We might have heard some things  Was it on the air or off?  It was unfortunately off  Oh, damn  We're waiting for the  Unfortunately off  One of these people will crack  Someone's going to crack  They're going to crack  One of these days  Thank you so much  But it won't be on this show  We're going to make headlines  It'll be like right after they leave this show  They'll go somewhere else  When you know the show's going away  Then we'll get you people back  Looking at illegal stuff on Chevy's computer  Yeah  All the good stuff will come out  He doesn't know how to use a computer  I bet  I had to reset his Apple ID password for him once  Really?  Yeah 
[00:03:00]  Was it scumbag?  No  I'm teasing of course  Gentleman  He does have a reputation  I'm just saying  I'm not sure if it's true or not  I don't know the man  We almost met him once  We were in makeup together  That's right  He refused to acknowledge us  Yeah  Even after we said hi  Even after we said hi  Well he's hard of hearing  Is that what was going on?  Yeah  I saw him at Book of Mormon  I sat right behind him 
[00:03:30]  Oh yeah?  He enjoyed it very much  Was he hooking and hollering at it?  Yeah  It's supposed to be a great show  I haven't seen it  Was it?  I don't go for the salty language  But aside from that  You're telling it sensibility  Yeah you can go for that  I thought they could have  Taken the high road  Did Chevy have a personality transplant?  I know  It's a good joke  Teasing of course  I love Chevy  I met him once  He was pleasant  Was he?  Alright there you go  That sounds good 
[00:04:00]  What a rousing endorsement that is  He was pleasant  But we only spoke for a second  Nana's pleasant too  I don't want to be in a room with her  Exactly  Handed me a sugar cookie  We only met for a second  And I annoyed him to take a photo  He's a legend you know  Yes he is  Meeting him is like  Fletch come on  Like meeting  Fletch lives  Cops and Roberson's  Cops and Roberson's  Has Joel told you  That's third on your list?  Well that's the one Joel brings up daily  Of course he does  That's great  That's why we love Joel  Has Joel ever told you about Karate Dog?  No  Our obsession with Karate Dog? 
[00:04:30]  No  Alright so  He is the voice  Chevy Chase is the voice of Karate Dog  Well of course  I know  In the movie Karate Dog  That's what you guys should Google  That's amazing  Can we Google Karate Dog?  Yeah  Please  You have to  You're at the computer  No I'm just kidding  Wow  You're a big star  Don't do it  Jumping robot  So it is  Karate Dog  It's a movie that stars Simon Rex  Look at you doing all the work  I'm doing all the work here  Can you book my flight?  John Voight 
[00:05:00]  Karate Dog  John Voight's in it?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And Chevy is the voice of Karate Dog  And Joel discovered it one day on  In Pablo Francisco  Yeah  Showtime  And so Joel started buying every DVD that was under $5 on eBay of Karate Dog  And by the end of the season he had 50 copies of it in his trailer  And the last day of shooting he presented Chevy with 50  With all of the copies  Yeah  I'm sure Chevy took the joke well and laughed  He did 
[00:05:30]  Oh wait  He started hiding them on the set  So there was one scene where we all had to get up to a lectern  And he put a copy of Karate Dog  And it took Chevy like 15 minutes to notice it  We thought that he was taking it really well  But then we realized he just hadn't seen it  And then when he finally found it  He was like  You prick  And like flung it at Joel  But he  He is hard to work with  He take much delight in Karate Dog  It's our favorite thing  Let's try to hear Chevy as Karate Dog  Seeing eye cat  Or watch cat  No  Oh yeah 
[00:06:00]  Looks good  Wanna come back to my place  That's Chevy  Right there  If you were high you would never stop laughing  Yeah  No  He's a party animal  Oh shit he's got a band  Oh neat  They're playing instruments  Ah this is bullshit  Animals don't do this  Oh mineral chip  Hey you playing poker or what  Alright enough  Ah  The guy got pissed on  It's great  John Voight is in this  John Voight  They're both karate masters  Is that when I have Midnight Cow Dog  Where the dog gets blown by some kid 
[00:06:30]  In fucking Times Square  Please don't beat me up  And that's a good one  Yeah  Robbie May and Ben Bailey  Jamie Presley  Simon Rex  John Voight  And the voice of Chevy Chase  That's Karate Dog  This is only age worst of 2012  So far  On the Opie and Anthony channel  We got the Chevy Chase call  Oh I want to hear that  Oh they had the call they released  Oh yeah  We got the call  And  It's good  We were just 
[00:07:00]  Talking to  Gillian Jacobs the other day  Saying come on  Tell us  He's an asshole  Right  We all know he's an asshole  Yeah  We've been told he's an asshole  Everyone knows he's an asshole  He's never not been an asshole  Me and Ant  We're in the makeup room  The same time as this  Fucking jizz bag  And  He wouldn't fucking talk to us  After we try to introduce ourselves  He's an asshole  You don't think this is a work  No  So  What's the story  I guess he walked off  The set  Last day of  Shooting Community  This past season  Yeah 
[00:07:30]  So apparently they were filming the finale  And he walked off the set  Some people say it's because  He didn't think the episode was funny  And he said it's because  They didn't have a script  And so he was tired of it  And so he walked off  Then  Dan Harmon  Who's the show creator  Right  At the wrap party  That Chevy Chase  And his family were at  Had a toast  They said  Fuck you Chevy  And tried to get everybody  To chant  Fuck you Chevy  While Chevy was in the room  While Chevy  With his wife  Yeah  Right  And so then Chevy  Left an expletive laden 
[00:08:00]  Voicemail for Dan Harmon  Which Dan Harmon  Then shared  With everybody  One of those people  Was recording it  Oh  Oh very cool  So  I hear it's hard to hear though  Unfortunately huh  It's a little hard to hear  But you can make it out  You can make out some of the shit  Alright here's  Chevy Chase  Ladies and gentlemen  Chevy Chase  Are you ready  Take your ass  Get here  Ladies and gentlemen  That's on the phone  Dan Harmon  That's Dan Harmon  Being an asshole to Chevy  Like ladies and gentlemen  Chevy Chase 
[00:08:30]  Cause he knew he was revving up  No he's saying  Ladies and gentlemen  Chevy Chase  And then he played the voicemail  Oh  Got it  Got it  It's theater for you  Alright  Ladies and gentlemen  Chevy Chase  If you're ready  Take your medicine  Get here  Get your medicine  You fat fuck  You can get a subscription  You can't win  So I don't even know  What the fuck would go on  At the week  During the week  Second of all  Your god damn bad writing  Shit  Sicko  Fuck  Abomination 
[00:09:00]  And your writing  Is getting worse and worse  So I sat back on  I don't care  They're all laughing  Why are they laughing  They don't laugh at you  Something's suspicious  About this  Yes  He's roasting him back  Or something  There's something weird  Something's suspicious  I thought he was playing it  In front of a bunch of people  And they're laughing  Yeah  Who are the bunch of people though  Probably co-workers  Because they all know  Chevy's an asshole  That's what I'm getting from it  Oh  Okay  Like they're not taking him seriously  It's like listen to this  Fucking dick  Oh okay  Yeah I think that's what it is 
[00:09:30]  Because he said in the past  That he has problems with the show  He doesn't like  Oh okay  Dan Harmon  He's a dude  Why does he like community  He doesn't like  Critically acclaimed  Wouldn't most actors want that  He said he doesn't like  On a resume  He doesn't think it's a funny show  And he doesn't think  His character's funny  He said  Why is he doing it  Like they'll ask him  To hack you  Like you know  Are you like your character  And he goes  No I'm funny  He's funny  When  When was Chevy  Fucking funny  Oh god 
[00:10:00]  I can't talk to like that  By anybody  Certainly not  In front of my wife  And daughter  You god damn asshole  Alcohol  And fat shit  There don't have to be  About 57  If you're lucky  The way you eat  And I'm gonna say to you  Except  You can suck my cock  And clear  I hope you can play that  For everybody around you  Who agrees with you  That I should say  Fuck you  And in front of all  Of those people  To me and my family  Wow 
[00:10:30]  Hmm  Wow  Yeah  I mean  I don't think it works  No no no  You're right  I for a second  Thought it was  Because they were laughing  Yeah I know  It sounds like it's nice  But it's almost like Chevy  Don't you know  Everyone who's ever worked  At you says  That you're a douchebag  Yeah  Everyone  Yeah  He says he doesn't like sitcoms  But why are you doing one  Just keep doing movies  It's the calm part of it  He's got a problem with  Yeah  Jeez  He's terrible  Is this gonna be  The last season of Community  Well I mean  I would think  That they would want to go on  As long as possible  They're not planning on ending it now 
[00:11:00]  But like season four I guess  Is when you get into syndication  So they're excited about  Gotcha  This one  But  Well they thought that this  One that just happened  Could be the last one  After they went on hiatus  But  I don't know if season four  I don't think it's officially  Been announced yet  But  Everybody's hoping that it happens  They haven't been picked up  But it's the second highest rated  Sitcom  Yeah  Behind the office  So  After they came back  They started  Murdering  Comparatively  Nice  Good for them  I like a lot of those people  It's a good show too  It's really funny 
[00:11:30]  I love Joel McHale  We go way back with Joel  Joel  Not so much with Chevy  No  I would have had a great line  If I was there too  What would you have said  Hey I wish he was  He'd tell you how he really feels  Yeah  That's a good one  That is a good one  What  Probably better that you weren't there  A place where I want bananas  That makes sense  Sam  Chris Humphreys  Yeah  That's where the whole  Looking like a dummy in a hot tub  Started  With Chris Humphreys  I thought it was with Diddy  I don't know if it was Diddy 
[00:12:00]  I thought  We were talking about Chris Humphreys  But Diddy was in the hot tub  In Biggie's video  Just looking like a dummy in a hot tub  That's true too  Yeah  But we did refer to Chris Humphreys  As the big dummy in a hot tub  He's also a dummy in a hot tub  But you know what  He's fighting back  You know he's got that  Kim Kardashian divorce thing happening  And he refuses to sign the papers  Until she admits it's fake right  Yep  Seven million fucking dollars  They're willing to pay Chris Humphreys  And they have called him  Kind of a gold digger  And he's like  I ain't signing shit  Until this broad in her family 
[00:12:30]  Admits this whole thing  Was a fake fucking wedding  Wait they'll pay him  To sign  Does he  Does he admit the whole thing was fake  Or he thought it was real  And he's realizing that he was set up  I believe his claim is that  It was  They set it up  Without telling him  Without telling him  And he thought it was real  Yeah  And he's a fucking idiot  So that's a possibility  So wait a minute  Did fucking  What's the seven million dollar thing  They're saying if you  They're trying to settle  And say here  Here's your seven million  Sign the fucking divorce paper  And go away  And don't talk about it anymore  Right  It's like fuck you 
[00:13:00]  Cause he  Cause you know  He's the laughing stock of the NBA  They fucking  Chan and make fun of him all the time  This is genuinely embarrassing  For the Kardashians too  To have this continue to be dragged on  Yeah  He looked like an idiot  Through this whole fucking thing  And they like  So he's fighting back  Saying fuck you  They like to somewhat  Control their press  Whether it's positive or negative  Just to kind of you know  He's refusing to divorce Kim  Unless she gives him  A public apology  And admits the entire wedding  Was staged by her and her family  There you go  They've offered him seven million  To shut up and go away  But he won't take it 
[00:13:30]  Nope  Go away  Chris wants Kim to admit  To fraud  To admit the whole thing  Was staged for publicity  To make a public apology  To him  Because he really wanted  A marriage  So he believed it was real  He was very much in love  And now he's starting to think  Holy fuck  These assholes set me up  Very much in love  Very much in love  Comes off like such a dolt  On that show  He's a moron  But they really fucking  If that's true  Then they really fucked him over  Then they did fuck him over  And the Kardashians  The team Kim  They call it  They're attacking Humphreys 
[00:14:00]  They're trying to spin  Kim as the victim  But Chris isn't going to stand for it  Good for him man  How much is his contract for  In the NBA  He might not need seven million  He might get more out of this  No one would  No one would say no  To seven million dollars  That's true  What the fuck you make  You kidding me  Gotta grieve at you  Gotta grieve at you  On that one  If he's not letting it go  For seven million  That's fucking  He's making a few million a year easy  He is right  Oh yeah  So  Just for putting a ball in a hoop  What about that  I hear ya 
[00:14:30]  What's his contract  Um  What  What's his  What is he  Oh uh  Three point two million  What's that that much  I mean it's a lot  But I mean  He could use seven though  Fuck yeah  The character Chevy plays  Is exactly like he is  On the voicemail  Maybe they're trying  Maybe they're trying  To get a little buzz out there  Maybe not  Should we be suspicious  Or not on that one  No that's  I mean  Travis  The voicemail is not like  Chevy's character at all  Alright  He doesn't walk around  Calling people  No no I'm not suspicious at all  And there's another  Drunk cocksuckers  There's another update 
[00:15:00]  On Deadline's website  That says that a lot of people  That were at the cast party  Agree with Chevy's  Side of the story  That they were having a  Quote non-script day  When he walked off  So Chevy seems to be  Telling the truth there  If you're to believe  Other people  Still comes off as a prick  Oh yeah  Absolutely  But I don't think  This is a work at all  Yeah  Oh no I think you're right  It's fine with us for a sec  Plus it's I mean  It's not like  It's just like a nice guy  Who's historically  Gotten a great reputation  Coming out  And looking like an asshole now  Right  We all knew  He was an asshole before 
[00:15:30]  Nothing worse than a  Fake  Call or whatever  Because you know  Nobody wants to hear  A work like that  It's just fucking stupid  This is Opie Anthony's  Worst of 2012  So far  What's up with Chevy man  There's another voicemail  Here we go  Come on  Come on  Let's make some  I don't know  Some press today  Killian was here  I am beautiful  And talented  And lovely  She is such a  Friggin pisser man  She's a lot of fun  And we were talking 
[00:16:00]  To her about it  And was she  I don't know  She didn't say anything  Right  Officially  Everyone always  Her body language  Everyone always makes a face  Like  That guy  So alright  Look  I'll phrase it in a way  That's it  Alright  Joel  We know  Chevy's the biggest prick  You've ever worked with  Who's the second  Oh  My word  I'm gonna go with Kelly  No  Kelly 
[00:16:30]  Yeah that ripper  It almost feels like  He's trying to sabotage the show  Why would you want to do that  The one they  I don't know  One of those things  I got on a plane yesterday  And when I came off  They're like  So how about that voicemail  Have we heard it  One plane ride  And then there's another voicemail  Another voicemail  I haven't heard it  I literally heard it  You haven't heard it yet  I haven't heard it  I haven't heard it  I read a transcript of it  Why don't we hear it  I get the transcripts  From all the shows  Yeah you gotta get the transcripts  Oh great  Joel's like  Oh great  Let's hear it 
[00:17:00]  We might stop it a few times  I gotta work with this guy  I'm just glad to see a CD  That's  I know right  That's kind of dumb  Digital  Hi Dan  It's Chevy  Oh boy  Who's he talking to  Dan  First of all  It's just  Hi Dan  It's Chevy  And Joel just goes  Oh boy  I have a feeling  Joel might have had a few  Of these calls  Oh god  I know  Hi Joel  It's Chevy  Chevy and I do text each other  But the only thing  Chevy and I text each other  Onion headlines  That's his  Oh yeah 
[00:17:30]  That's his thing  That's our relationship  Very funny  Who's Dan again  Dan Harmon  Dan Harmon is the creator  Of the show  The creator  Okay  The creator  Chevy  Chevy Chase  I've looked at now  Three shows in a row  That's last week  And a couple this week  I've watched more than that  But the point  I want to make is this  There's a disconnect  Somewhere  Either between  Either between  The 
[00:18:00]  The sigh  What is actually shot  And  The  The  The humor  On  The set  When we shoot it  And  The final product  The editing  I don't know who's doing the editing  And making the choices  That count the most  Now hold on for a second  He  He pretty much described  The entire show  Like it's like  There seems to be a disconnect  Between  Everything 
[00:18:30]  The acting  The  The mood in the studio  The  The  The recording of it  The editing  Drops  I don't like the way  The credits roll at the end  But I'll tell you  This is getting  Dan Harmon leaked the first one  He played it  And it got leaked  And he felt bad about it  He apologized for playing that message  But this is another one to him  And this is a much better quality one  Yeah  I don't know what their relationship is  But it just sounds like  He's had enough  Of hearing from this guy  And we're just speculating here  We are just speculating 
[00:19:00]  I'm not speculating  And you're not speculating  We're speculating with you in the room  You're like a litmus paper  Thank you  We have to talk  But we can look at it  And know exactly what's going on  It also means I'm thin  That's true too  Thank you  He's moving a lot in his chair  You notice that  He's a litmus paper  Joel is fidgeting about  What was Gillian doing?  She was  She put her head down  She'd look up  And look  Out of the corner of the eye  Look up and smile a little  It was way cuter than what I'm doing  Oh adorable  Well you're pretty cute too  Thank you  But she also  I think I saw her mouth 
[00:19:30]  Fuck that Chevy  Wow  I'm teasing of course  We don't know for sure  You can't blow up your own show  I understand that  So get to work with this person  It's a real thing  But he's being very  He's kind of  This is public stuff now  And it's getting to a point  Where it looks like  He's the problem  It's hurting  The perception of the show  And it's a good show  But at least we are picked up  For a fourth season  Oh you are?  Yes  No we're not  Oh Jesus  I'm joking  I think it will be though  I hope so  But I'm saying  That's why I said 
[00:20:00]  It almost seems sabotaging  This helps  This helps  He wants to stop Joel  Chevy didn't release this stuff  No I don't  Okay  No no  I don't know how Chevy could have  He didn't release this stuff  But it just seems like  He's a very difficult guy  But if you ask Chevy to  Like we'll release a voicemail  It would be impossible  For him to figure it out  So  I'd be like  Take that off the phone  So  I want to hear that  What?  Yeah  But I will say this  The other part of the disconnect 
[00:20:30]  Is that  Obviously  You don't get my humor at all  That's true  Or what it is I do  That's funny  That actually makes people laugh  I do agree with that  You've got two choices  What is he doing?  Is that Dan Harmon?  Is that Dan talking over it?  That's Dan talking over  That's Dan talking over  Wow  Well it's  Yeah  That's true  Wow that's brutal  I guess it's not technically a voicemail  Wow  No  He's fucking commenting on it  Wow  Or maybe Dan's voicemail is set up  That just  It'll agree with what you're saying 
[00:21:00]  Yeah I agree with that  That would be great  Randomly  This is a discussion  A lot of people  No no this is a voicemail  Oh he's as high as Chevy  I think he's just fucking  Giving his comments over the voicemail  As he's recording it  I think  He's talking  Yeah  Wow  I do agree with that  You've got two choices  One is storyline  The other is  You know  Like everybody gives a  About the  Story  When they don't even know  Who the characters are  Or  There's make people laugh  Now you know what I do 
[00:21:30]  And I don't appreciate  You know  Like a great joke  Like  The cast being ripped off  You know  And pointing out  All the funny things  That are on  In my cast  That I've tried  To scratch  And it's just  It's just cut out  There's just one line  About some kind of  A thing I eat  That was in my cast  When you had  Big laughs  That's just physical  I'm just talking about  Laughing  Again 
[00:22:00]  Tonight  I'm looking at  Two  I'm doing  In that  Place  On a wheelchair  It's cut  Down  Down  Down  Down  So that what  So that people  Can follow the  Storyline  Between Joel  And Gillian  And love affairs  And kissing  Come on man  You're missing  The point  I mean  I really 
[00:22:30]  This is not  My kind of comedy  I thought you hired me  For what I can do  That's funny  You gotta give me  Some range  And then you don't  Have some  Editor with no  Sense of humor  No sense  No sense of me  Cutting things down  To the point where  I just look like  I don't like it  And you know  I should have had this  Talk to you  Face to face  But I didn't want to  Because I really like you  I think your writing 
[00:23:00]  Is great  I think everything  You do is great  But the problem  Really is Dan  You're not there  When we shoot  And you're not there  When they edit  So you don't even  Know what you have  You don't even know  What it is  I'm f***ing doing  And if you want me  On this f***ing show again  I got news for you  I don't want it  It's just a  F***ing mediocre sitcom  Wow  I want people to laugh  And this isn't funny  And it ain't funny to me 
[00:23:30]  Because I'm 67 years old  And I've been doing this  A long time  Every year of it  And I've been making  A lot of people laugh  A lot better than this  Joel  Good times  Joel comment  Everything's comfortable  All the time  Good times  That is a little  A little  Well here's the  Good news  Yes sir  That was apparently  From what I read  Was over a year old  Really  So  Oh is that a year old  That's the other thing  It's a year old 
[00:24:00]  See we didn't know that  And he's  So he came back  So it all worked out  So it all worked out  Everything is good now  That's very good  No that was the other thing  Because it said in the article  At least I think it was  The Huffington Post article  It's like this is from  Over a year ago  Or a year ago  Because he said he's 67  He's almost 69 now  Oh man  Wow  So  Well did they  The plot thickens  Whoever  Do you think they  Do you think they  Gave him what he wanted  More of the funny  Yeah 
[00:24:30]  Well more importantly  Why are these voicemails  Coming out now  Right  That's what  That's  Confuses me  Who has them  And why do they  They feel like they need  To release this now  Somebody's trying to  Sabotage something  Or get him  Why would the creator  Do that  If they're trying  To get picked up  For a fourth season  I don't know  I mean I don't know  It's his voicemail  So it starts with him  Yeah  But I don't know  Where  You know  In a year's time  What happens to those things  Right  Yeah  But you know  What's great  Is that it's great  To talk about  It's fun 
[00:25:00]  Right  It's fun  It's so uncomfortable  It's good times  What's the good times  It's buzz  What was the first  It's like being on the Kardashians  No matter what  It's all good press  What was the first sign  That there was something  I'm not saying you have trouble with them  What was the first sign  That there was  There was tension  Because you see tension sometimes  What was the first sign  What was the first sign  That there was going to be  Some kind of a tension  Was it an argument  With a writer  Or was it  I think  Like the second day of work  Chevy strangled an extra  No  No 
[00:25:30]  Boy  You know  I swear to you  When I say this  That the cast  Does get along  Well  And Chevy  Is very  He can be very warm  On set  But you know  Just like everyone  Can get into bad moods  And  Like Jim  When you walked in  You literally slapped me in the face  But I don't mind being  But honestly  We all get pissy here  We do  It's part of  It's part of a working relationship  People tend to hear when we are  Because they can hear us  Yeah  In a live moment  So they kind of know  Like he's feeling shitty 
[00:26:00]  Or and is whatever  But on sitcoms  It happens too  And it's just  With this now  It's become a public  Right  Now everyone  Yeah  And it looks divisive  Because they're not  Taping that stuff usually  Right  No  And it's like  You know  It's Chevy  Being Chevy  And  The reputation  Is terrible for him  And it's like  You don't want to believe it  Like  Not you  But I mean  Like myself  It's like  Alright  Everybody says  He's a hard guy  To work with  And he's a funny dude  But he's difficult to work with  And nobody likes him  And then he's like  He's on this show  With a much younger cast  It's almost like  A more relevant thing  Than he's done in a long time 
[00:26:30]  Yeah  And he's just  Motherfucking everybody  And it's like  Do you not see  That you're the common denominator  In every situation you're in  It's you  Look  Anyway  Just like Kevin  What's great about  These Cure songs  That's  You want to go with  Just like Kevin  That was the one  I was trying to come up with  Just like Kevin  Yes  That's what I was trying  That's what I want to say  What the set is like  Oh  Oh yeah  See if you played this song  Underneath the voicemail  Underneath the voicemail  It would sound much better  Yeah  Go ahead  Play a little bit  Of the voicemail  Well  I guess I can do that  Oh you put it away  Wow  I did put it away 
[00:27:00]  See this is how you work  Oh god bless you  Here start this over  Because this is a long intro  Yeah  So it'll work  But this intro really  Like you know  Oh the intro  Makes it exciting  I hated it  See  Um  Chevy  Chevy Chase  This sounds like  The beginning of a great  80's movie  Yeah  I've watched it now  Three shows in a row  I feel like we're about to  Hit a dance  Wait was that other  Was that other voicemail  That went public recent  I've watched more  That one was recent  Oh that's why  Okay that's why 
[00:27:30]  He released the other one  He's probably tired of getting these  I would listen to this song  Yeah  You know something  I gotta be honest with you  If a cast gets taken off  Of your leg  And a bunch of stuff falls out  That you've been scratching  Your leg with  Yeah  That's pretty fucking funny  And that would  That happened  Yeah  We showed that  When it opened up  He had like nine  Pepperoni sticks  And everything  He had shoved in there  To scratch  Yeah to scratch  Yeah he had hangers  So I agree with that  That's kind of funny  Plastic knives  Yeah and that all happened  Did it make the final cut  It did make 
[00:28:00]  That made the final cut  There's uh  You know because  The  Well he was wearing  A body cast in that  And we thought  That he had stolen a pen  So we sawed it off  And sawed his cast off  And when he took it off  We were all  Almost vomited  From the smell  That was all in the script  So that all went well  I thought that was  A good episode  Actually it was  It was the bottle episode  Which  We were just looking  For a pen  And um  Does it bother you  To hear him mention  Your name like that  Because he's not  Motherfucked  He's not saying  You're not funny 
[00:28:30]  No it's Jimmy Chay  Saying my name  Excites me  But is it annoying  No one sees that  Like in the context  Of how come you're  Showing this  And not my thing  Well I disagree  With him about story  I think it's important  To  You have to tell the story  And tell great jokes  At the same time  To forward it along  But that's kind of  Like a weird  Like well darn it  These stories  No uh  But uh  But yeah  No I  That doesn't bother me  Opi and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  So far  Continues right now 
[00:29:00]  Yeah  Now  Now  Worst of 2012  So far  For the Opi and Anthony show  My name is E-Rock  Still to come  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  Was in studio  But there was a bit of a  Problem with his publicist  We'll get into that  A little bit later  Opi is disgusting  You'll find out  What that's all about  Nicholas Cage is in studio  Which is a real treat  We find out what's  Going on with Uncle Paul  In the Sandusky trial  Rich Voss sings  Opi has a bit of a  Issue  Problem  He fucks up something  With iced tea

Anthony channel  Very cold 
[00:30:00]  Thank you  I love you guys  We spoke to you  On the phone  Oh Jim Norton  Yes  I know Jim Norton  Oh my goodness  Crazy about Jim Norton  Thank you  You know Jim Norton  Isn't he great  He's great  You guys are great  We love Jimmy  Thank you sir  We talked to you  Once on the phone  I know  Yeah on the phone  It was nice to see you  I know  How was I  What was I  On the phone  We spoke about a few things  I guess  We just laughed a lot  Yeah we had a lot of  We talked about  Well first and foremost  Of course  The vigilante  Death Wish  Right 
[00:30:30]  Of course  One of your  Very early roles  Yeah it's still  It's still my favorite thing  Not that I don't love  Your other work  But that's still  The greatest line  I think ever uttered  It has  It has absolutely  Made it to the machine  Here  Goddamn rich cunt  Oh you got headphones there  But he doesn't want  To mess up his hair  I know that  You know that  That sounds great  Here it is  Here it is  Goddamn rich cunt  I kill rich cunt  Jeez  That's very strong  That's some strong language  Can you play that  On the radio 
[00:31:00]  Well it's satellite  So we can  A lot of latitude  I see  Look at that  Oh now I'm on  FM radio  A lot of  Yeah a lot of latitude  You know  I see  Okay  But that  That was such a  A fun role  I think  I mean you looked like  You were having a great time there  A little  Little hijinks and shenanigans  In the apartment  A little  Goddamn rich cunt  It was brutal  Yeah you really knew that thing  You really remember that thing  Oh god yeah  Yeah of course  Yeah I was thrilled to do it  It was the first thing  I ever auditioned for 
[00:31:30]  It was kind of a miraculous story  Really  I loved it  Yeah  You know I was a kid  I'd just come out of the  Neighborhood playhouse  Studying with Sandy Meisner  And you know  And a bunch of  Three guys at a time  Went into this room  And we improvised  Little you know  This little rape  And murder scene  And they picked me up  So let me ask you a question  About Meisner too  Like what's the difference  Between that  And say like  What Brando took  Method acting  What's the technique difference  That's a very interesting question  Oh you know 
[00:32:00]  They all came  Out of the group theater  Strasburg  And Stella Adler  And Meisner  And then they differed  In a little bit of their  This is inside baseball stuff  In their technique  You know  So they differed  But they all came out  Of that in the 30s  If you know  The group theater  There's a wonderful book  Called The Fervent Years  That's all about that  Stanislavski was doing  What he was doing  In Moscow around that time 
[00:32:30]  And they changed  American acting  In the 30s  And it's too boring  To go into the details  Of how Strasburg  And Meisner  Kind of parted  Theoretical ways  But you know  Basically all those  Modern actors  Are trying to  We're trying to do something  A little different  Than what had been done before  Whereby they make it  A more authentic  Lived out  Actor experienced story  So you really feel  Like you're not just  Being presented 
[00:33:00]  With an actor  But you know  When Brando first  Walked on stage  People said  Geez is that a stagehand  Who has just wandered  On the stage  It was a little more  True to life  You know  That kind of thing  That amazes me  That there's  It's so much work  And studying  To just look natural  We were talking about it  Jim was talking about  Seeing you  In your play  Seminar  Yes very good  And just saying  Last night  You did  You saw it last night  Yeah it was great  Thank you for coming  Yeah  How great and natural it was  Is what Jimmy was saying 
[00:33:30]  Your acting is  Yeah  Fantastic  It was amazing  When you  Because I watch  Because I panic  When I have to act  And I just kind of  Stand all stiff and shit  When I watch somebody  Who's so good  I watch your hand motions  And it's very natural  The way you gesticulate  And talk  And I'm like  That's just how he is  Probably off  You don't feel like  You're watching somebody  Act  You just feel like  You're watching a guy  Talk to four different  People on stage  It's really interesting to watch  Very sweet  Thank you very much  And it was funny  And it's funny isn't it  Yeah  It's at the Golden Theatre  It's 90 minutes  It's a lot of laughs 
[00:34:00]  People are naked  There's some girls  Who are naked sometimes  There's sex going on  And I love the play  Teresa Rebeck wrote it  A brilliantly talented  Smart  Funny author  And Sam Gold  Who if people don't know  Is a hot and spectacular  Young director  He's done a few things  On right now  He was great to work with  And then that cast  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention  Heddy Ann Park  And Jerry O'Connell  Whom you know  And Justin Long  And Zoe Lister Jones  They're fantastic 
[00:34:30]  Jimmy said Justin Long  Was great  Yeah and I didn't know  And so was Jerry  I didn't know the women's names  But I will say  The best nipple  I've probably ever seen  Mine?  Well yeah  That kind of went without saying  I mean  After yours  Oh you're talking about  Well that's high praise indeed  What made it the best nipple though?  It was just thick  And I noticed it from the third row  I hit Bob Kelly  I'm like that's the best  Fucking nipple I've ever seen  Did it take you out of the play  For a second?  Dude I couldn't stop looking at her  It was just so sexy  When she just  Did you have the slow fade 
[00:35:00]  Into the  Oh sorry Jeff  This is how you  We hope not to  Diminish or vulgarize  What you do  But Heddy Ann Park  Is a master artist herself  That's sexy  Yes she is sexy  Do you do a lot of theater  Over the years?  Have you done a lot of theater?  You know I started doing theater  Even before Death Wish  Right around that time  I had done  Two Gents  This musical  Of Two Gentlemen of Verona  At the St. James Theater  With Raul Julia  And then El Grande  At a Coca-Cola  This funny show  And da da da da  And then through the years  Some other things 
[00:35:30]  A few other Broadway shows  So you're a song and dance man too?  Well I wouldn't say that  Really  I love music  Music is part of my life  Though I play piano  I have a jazz band  In Los Angeles  Called the Mildred Schnitzer Orchestra  And when I'm there  And I'm not working  We play out and about  And I play with really great musicians  If you're out there  You should come to see where we are  It's fun  Who's in the band with you  At one point?  I just read something  Somebody said they were  Peter Weller  Originally kind of started it  You know  We were in a movie together  You know  Buckaroo Bonsai  We met 
[00:36:00]  And we started to play it  But there are a lot of  But he's since  Married as a kid recently  And has gone off  But the core group  Keeps changing a little bit  But I play with great musicians  Anthony Wilson has played  With us recently  He's a premier guitar player  Right now  Brilliant musician  Plays with Diana Krull  Right now  And some other guys  Who are just great  You know what you're great at too  And I like watching you talk  You're great at doing  There's a couple of amazing  Monologues you have  And I've never seen anybody 
[00:36:30]  So good at just taking words  And making them his  It's like watching you talk  Right now  Is exactly like  Watching you talk  When you act  It's fucking  Depressing  It's so good  It's depressing  And I'm watching for it  You're depressing Jimmy  No but I mean that  In a good way  It's like  It's effortless  It's effortless  It's effortless  These weird pacing moments  And not delivering  Like you know  I just go  Line line line  Period  Line line line  Period  Watching the way  Your cadence 
[00:37:00]  And your pacing  Is fucking great man  Thank you so so much  You know I'm a humble  Student at it  I'm trying to get better  At it  But it fascinates me  It always has  I teach myself  Out in California  Whenever I'm not working  For the last 20-30 years  And I'm a kind of  Craft geek  You know  I love to figure out  How to  It seems simple  And it's  You know  It may on a certain level  It might be simple  You know  We're talking  We show up  We can do things  It seems like it's talking  But really  When you see people  Do it on a high level 
[00:37:30]  Not necessarily myself  But it's what  Excites me  And what I might  What I love to strive for  Is  It's  It's  It can be  A refined  Beautiful  Thing  I've seen acting  That has changed  My life  And had teachers  That have changed  My life  Certainly  This play is about  A teacher  I play a teacher  In it  And there are  People who want  To be creative artists  In this case  Writers  Two guys and two girls  And that's what  It's all about  It's about the serious  Business of training  People for something serious 
[00:38:00]  Especially in the creative arts  But anything  I suppose if you're a soldier  Or if you're a  An athlete  As we know  You know  If you want to be  On the highest level  It's a very elite group  That gets winnowed down  And the first qualification  I think  Before we know  Even if you're  Especially gifted  And talented  Which you'll finally  Have to be  Is if you've got  The entry level  Qualification of commitment  And you're wildly  Passionately  Enthusiastic  And for some crazy reason 
[00:38:30]  And it's irrational  You're in love with it  Like  And you can't live without it  You want it so badly  I remember my father  Saying you can taste  That's the only reason  You should act  He knew about that  He told me that  And he said  If you find something  You love to do  That's what to do  And somehow  I was gifted with that  Early on  Not with talent or anything  But with this idea  With this singular  And passionate idea  When I was a kid  It came upon me  I don't know  I was watching  I don't know how  They took us to see  Children's Theater 
[00:39:00]  Or whatever  But I got this idea  And by the time  I was in high school  I'd taken a course or two  In the summer  I would  It became kind of a secret  For me  And every morning  When I took a shower  The steam would appear  On the door  And while I was in there  I'd write  Please God  Let me be an actor  And then before I left  I would erase it  I was absolutely obsessed with it  And that's basically  What I as the character  And the teacher  In this show  Am trying to find out  And let them find out 
[00:39:30]  About themselves  If that's what they're made of  I keep saying  At the end  The last line of the play  Is do you want to be a writer  Or not  And it's what I  That's basically my theme  As I continue  I'm a very tough teacher  And I beat them up  Spoiler alert  Did he just give away the play?  No he doesn't  Well not really  It's the fun is getting there  You know  And I'm a terrible teacher  And it's very painful for them  And they misconstrue it  And they go  Is this guy awful?  Is he a villain?  Is he trying to just beat us down?  Or what?  But in fact  I'm tearing off band-aids 
[00:40:00]  Ego band-aids  And all kind of things  In order to get to that  Basic question  And get them  Ignited into a commitment  You said something in there  Yeah  Whose performance blew you away?  You said some  Through the years?  Yes  One maybe we would know  Because I would assume  You probably see a lot of stuff we  Oh you know  Yeah yeah  Well you know  Maybe one  Me well  You know when I was a kid  Like I said  I saw children's theater  And just the guy playing  You know  Beauty and the Beast  I was like  What is he doing?  What's he doing?  Backstage and stuff  But once I got 
[00:40:30]  A little familiar with it  Oh jeez  I was thinking last night  Again about  Brando  Now that we mentioned  Him  You know  On the waterfront  You know  A lot of people  Will tell you  They became actors  Because that  That's not true with me  But you know  Once you know about it  And once you see him do it  It's endlessly fascinating  To me  It was such a change  Between the acting  That had gone on  And was accepted  As acting before  And then after that  Much more real  Afterwards  And before 
[00:41:00]  It was this kind of  Over the top  Theater kind of  Acting  Yes  Mostly  You know  Talented people  Would emerge here and there  But he was distinct  And it was a landmark  And when he started  To do what he did  And it was because  Because of a change in time  And sensibility  And you know  Modern art was happening  And the other arts  Things were progressing  And therapy  And we understood more  About the psychology  Of the individual  And were more  Deeply interested in that  And all manner of things  So  But it changed  It changed 
[00:41:30]  Yeah  Isn't that fascinating  But I liked early on  Peter Sellers  I was thinking about  Peter Sellers  Oh yeah  Don't you love him  He was great in being there  I mean he had some  Phenomenal stuff  What a great movie  How about Lolita  I love him in Lolita  Oh yeah  Yeah  You know what I love him  And do you know  I'll bet you know this movie  After the Fox  I was talking about it  Last night  No  It's Vittorio De Sica  Directed  And it's Neil Simon's  First screenplay  Oh wow  He's in it  It's from a  Kitch period in the 60s  Burt Bacharach  Does the music  He sings  With the Hollies 
[00:42:00]  In fact  For those trivia experts  The theme song  After the Fox  The Fox is me  Ba da da da da  But it's hilarious  I saw it when I was a kid  With my sister in Pittsburgh  At the Leona Theater  And but I see it  And my dresser  At the show says  I remember that movie  I was 8 years old  When I first saw it  And I haven't found that  Since in my adult life  I had a copy of it  And I gave it to him  Last night  I love that  You're absolutely  A student of acting  And because there  Are some actors 
[00:42:30]  That are just like  Well I go up there  And I just you know  Make believe for a while  But you you know  Obviously take it  Very seriously  And still have fun with it  Do you like  Do you like a role  Like you're doing now  In the show  Or one of those  Blockbuster  Kind of Independence Day  Roles  That you know  Obviously storyline  And character development  Isn't as important  But it's a blockbuster  Yeah well it's nice  To be in something  That everybody sees  And is excited about  It's finally 
[00:43:00]  It comes up in the show  I say you know  You can be a brilliant writer  But if you're doing it  And you're a  If you don't  If you keep it in your drawer  And nobody sees it  You know  That's not the point  What we're doing here really  And you may consider yourself  Brilliant  And oh it's just for me  But no no no  Let's disabuse ourselves  Of that idea  Especially if it's brilliant  Let people see it  So it's nice and gratifying  To be in a popular thing  You know  And in fact  Those particular shows  Spielberg  He's  Yes there may have been  Dinosaurs in it  But the parts that I was in 
[00:43:30]  He was very attentive to  He's brilliant  And refined  And character oriented  And actor savvy  And actor passionate  And so it was creative  And but you know  You put a little mosaic piece  Here and there  One day after another  And it's creative  And fun in a different way  This I find  This particular show  A real  First class conditioning  Exercise for myself  And workout  There's a great  I'm sorry  There's a great  There's a great monologue  Where you kind of  Deconstruct 
[00:44:00]  Justin Long's character  And you kind of  Paint what it is  That he's doing  And it was really  Fucking well written  And it said so much  About like you just said  People that just want  To keep it for themselves  Instead of exposing  It was really  Really well written  And well performed  Thank you  I love that  It's been fun  To work on that  Like a little  You know  Sculptor  Sculpting project  You keep kind of  Detailing and finding  Out more about it  Because it's brilliant  Writing because  It's kind of ambiguous  It could mean a lot  Of different things 
[00:44:30]  But yes  It's an interesting  Moment in the  Show  An event  You know  He's like  There's this  Justin Long  Plays a brilliant  Writer  That I recognize  But I also recognize  The young me  In him  Me  The character  Is  I've sabotaged  Myself  With some  Personal  Problems  And ego  And narcissism  And you know  Unsociability  And this old  Antiquated idea  That if you're  Brilliant  You have the  Right and even  Obligation to be 
[00:45:00]  Screwy  And you can't  Put you can't  Have time for  Put up with  Regular people  And da da da da  And J.D. Salinger  Is our hero  And you have to  Disappear somehow  I say no  No no  Man  You're really  Off base  There  And in fact  You've got these  Ideas  I tell him  Because I'll paint  You a picture  Of what's going  To happen  He has just  Blown this  Opportunity  I've just  Given him  Not to give him  Anything away  But I've just  You know  Finally he's 
[00:45:30]  Showed me his  Work  He's been hiding  All this time  In class  He shows me  His work  I say this is  Absolutely brilliant  I recognize it  Immediately  And I say  I want to see  Everything you've  Ever written  We're going to  I'm going to  Work on this  He says no  You're terrible  You're a terrible  Teacher  You've taken  Too many drugs  You're abusing us  This guy is horrible  I'm not  And so he  Not only am I  And then he says  This thing to me  Which was the crux  Of my undoing  Career wise  In fact  Went for the jugular  He hits below the belt  And I'm very hurt  I'm very sensitive 
[00:46:00]  Myself  And so I  With a fierce  Truth assault  I attack back  On him  But show him  What this kind  Of personal quirk  And self destructiveness  Will lead to  In his life  Because I know  All too well  And then I say  And because you  Just did it here  This was the main thing  I offered you  The biggest opportunity  That you're ever  Going to have  And you have  Blown it  So wake up pal  This is great  It's like seeing  Part of the play  I know  It's so intense  Yeah 
[00:46:30]  It's like  I'm fixated  I know  What's the first thing  You do when you see a script  I always ask great actors  When you get a script  What do you do  Like okay  I'm going to play Leonard  What do you do from there  How do you  Do you memorize the lines first  Or do you think about the guy  I have no formula  You know  After all this time  Of being able to tell people  What to do  And there's some  Meat and potatoes things  You can follow  But finally  It's a creative  You know  It's a little project  An endeavor  And I myself  Have no formula  Each one 
[00:47:00]  You suggest something different  You know  And  You know  You read it  And yeah  Things will start to occur to you  Oh I know about this  I know about this guy  Here's a doorway  I can go through  I'm interested in this part of it  This aspect of the character  How to make this funny  Why this  Why he's doing that  How this is like my life  How I understand that  How this is like somebody else I know  Da da da da  And then  Yes  I start  I learn it early on too 
[00:47:30]  I like to know the words  I know there are actors who  And there are techniques  Where you can go  Oh you know  I'm not gonna  I'm not gonna learn the words too early  And that  There's something in that  But it's also  An excuse for laziness too  And there are pitfalls in learning it  You don't want to become mechanical  You want to be flexible  You want to get with the other actors  And then adjust to them  And adjust to the ideas of the director  But you can avoid those somehow too 
[00:48:00]  And I find  From the day I get the part  There are things that I can do  That take up my whole day  You have quite a unique way of speaking  And body language  And over the years  People have imitated you  Do you have a sense of humor about yourself  Have you seen these  And enjoyed them  I'm always  Yeah  It's always funny  Yeah  I like them all  Yeah  Who do you know  Do you know  Anybody here  Eli Gold's a friend of mine  Eli Gold's fantastic  He's been very sweet to me  I love his impersonation 
[00:48:30]  It's very good  Does it  Does it  Is it odd to look at someone's interpretation of you  And go  Do I do that  Yes  It is  It is  You don't do it  You don't do it  I don't do impressions  No  I'm a sucker for impressions  I like any impressions  I like all impressionists  I don't do it  You know  I do one of mediocrity  You're fantastic  Kevin Spacey  I did a play with him recently  In London  And he's a master impersonator  He does the only William Hurt  That I've ever seen  Oh wow 
[00:49:00]  Really  Oh it kills me  It cracks me up  I love his William Hurt  It's fantastic  Who else is  What's his name  The actor from Usual Suspects  Well I know  Kevin Pollack  Kevin Pollack  Kevin Pollack  Duke Covney  Duke Covney  Oh my god  Duke Covney was doing  On SNL  Right  That was a famous one  I think he did it here  When he was in here  With us too  He did  Yeah  I think so  Really  Was he good  Yeah it was pretty god damn good  He's pretty good  I love what Elon does  And I think it's the only time  I'll think of the impression  When I'm listening to you  Because you'll go  But  But 
[00:49:30]  And Elon does this great  I know  And it's a brilliant thing  For him to have caught  Like that's what impressionists do  They catch something  That somebody does  That you just wouldn't think of  When you're doing the impression  And that's what made it  So unique and great  Yeah  Yeah  It's fun to watch  I know  I love it  It's like Christopher Walken  There's very few actors  Who are so interesting  That anything they do  You just want to hear  Their interpretation of it  Like literally  I want to hear  How Jeff Goldblum  Is going to do this  Or do that  And there's very few guys  Nicholson's one of those guys 
[00:50:00]  That's interesting enough  Walk in yourself  There's very few  You're so sweet  I love Chris Walken  Chris Walken and I  Have been in  Here's a trivia question  Four movies together  We've never had a scene together  We've come to know  I love to hang around him  He's  I get a big kick out of him  But  We've been in four movies  Think of even one movie  That you were in  That he was in  I'm not going to cheat  I love the trivia  He was not in the deer  You were not in the deer  I was not in the deer  No  King of New York  I was not in  King of New York 
[00:50:30]  That was a guess  But a question  I see I kind of  I tried to get an extra guess  Really?  Oh shit  I'd say the judges say  That's a guess  You've used up one guess  Yes  That's a tough one  Were they earlier films  From films we should know  Years ago?  Yes  Walken was not in  Independence Day  He was not in  Jurassic Park  That's right  He was not in  The Fly  He was not in  Death Wish  Yeah  I'm trying to think about it  Now that I've said it  I know it's four  I'm trying to remember  The four myself  Now you're trying to remember  Which ones they were  Yeah  I'll go over your bio 
[00:51:00]  Don't Google it  Don't Google it  We had Donald Sutherland  Here the other day  Oh I've done two  I've done two movies with him  Invasion of the Body Snatcher  That's correct  Fantastic  That movie  Thank you so much  Still holds up  Yeah  It still holds up  It's a great  Well it was  Well yeah  Thank you so much  I agree  Not because of me  But I like  Phil Kaufman  The director  Is spectacular  And Donald Sutherland  Leonard Nimoy  Yeah  Leonard Nimoy  Was in that  I like playing  The movie game  You know it goes  Actor movie  Actor movie  You know it's like  The Kevin Bacon game  You don't have to

[00:57:30]  I have an awful photo  With Jeff Goldblum  Oh my god  Look at that  And look at  Well this is not  One of my better moments  Of course  I have my hair  Is like Ernie Kovacs  In that  Very good  But you  You look  Look at you  Look at the fat face  Creep I am  No  You look very handsome  I look like  One of the things  That hatched  In Jurassic Park  Look at that  Whoa  Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12 
[00:58:00]  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  13  13  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  13  13  13  was a former intern for John F. Kennedy  and she put out 
[00:58:30]  a tell-all book saying that she lost her virginity  to the president and then  just having an ongoing affair with him  some of the people that worked for him  maybe his brothers  we get into detail here about her memoirs  and what not plus it leads to Drew Boogie's  famous remix of the Mimi Beardsley  song Oh Mimi Beardsley  following just after this  listen won't you  this is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012  so far  so what's going on with this JFK thing  I missed this one over the weekend 
[00:59:00]  when did this come out?  we have to  I have to read this book  it's probably the only thing that's good in the book  the excerpts were really good  very sexy  a lot of these people that have one moment in time  and they have like 200 pages  of filler in their book  she had a lot more than one moment  she took a lot of fucking presidential loads  oh this wasn't a one time thing?  fuck dude I'm so out of this  no  what's going on?  she was an intern  at the White House 
[00:59:30]  18 month affair  with Jack Kennedy  yeah  she was an intern at the White House?  yeah  so Clinton wasn't the first huh?  mm-mm  he made fucking  holy shit  JFK did it right  four days into her internship  that is great  she was invited by an aide  to go to the mid  for a midday swim  in the White House pool  that sounds nice  yeah midday swim  four days into it  you're all green  and ready to go  yep  where the handsome  45 year old president  swam daily  to ease chronic back pain 
[01:00:00]  JFK slid into the pool  and floated up to her  it's a Mimi isn't it?  he asked  yes sir  she said  and uh  you're in the press office  this summer right?  he does these impersonations  I swear  you would think  it was the real people  yes sir  I am  she said  that's what her voice  probably sounds like  oh god  lightning had struck  later that day  Mimi was invited  by Dave Powers  the president's first friend  and later  the long time curator 
[01:00:30]  of the Kennedy Library  in Boston  to an after work party  when she arrived  at the White House residence  Powers and two other  young female staffers  were waiting  Powers poured  and frequently  refilled her glass  with daiquiris  until the commander-in-chief arrived  get her  lickered up  yeah  nice  just so people know  they describe her  as a slender  golden-haired  19-year-old  yes  she's hot  they got pictures of her up  and uh  you can tell  even though it's like  the early 60s 
[01:01:00]  she's very hot  and and  because of her  finishing school  she was all polished  and blue blood  blue blood  she had blue blood  connections so  so JFK rolls up  the president  invited her  for a personal tour  she got up  expecting the rest  of the group  to follow  they know better  they didn't  he took her  to Mrs. Kennedy's room  which this by the way  this is a president  who has shit down  oh yeah  I noticed he was  moving closer and closer  I could feel his breath  on my neck  he put his hand 
[01:01:30]  on my shoulder  the next thing she knew  he was standing above her  looking directly into her eyes  and guiding her  to the edge of the bed  by the way  four days into her internship  four days  the day he met her  and we're not allowed  to have it turns  while we finally are  yeah  what the fuck  well he didn't  kick her in the cunt  slowly he unbuttoned  the top of my shirt dress  and touched my breasts  yes  then he reached up  between my legs  and started to pull off  my underwear  I finished unbuttoning 
[01:02:00]  my shirt dress  and let it fall  off my shoulders  oh man  Kennedy pulled his pants down  with his shirt still on  hovered above her  on the bed  he smelled of his cologne  47-11  he paused  when he noticed  she was resisting  holy fuck  she resisted a little bit  huh  well you know  little pre-game jitters  yeah  haven't you done this before  he asked  no she said  are you okay 
[01:02:30]  he asked  yes she said  so he kept going  this time a little more gently  ah what a guy  after he finished  he hitched up his pants  and smiled at me  and pointed at the bathroom  takes her cherry  then he hitches his pants up  and points to the toilet  points to the fucking bathroom  yeah she was a virgin  um  she said when she was done  she was in shock  he on the other hand  was matter of fact  and acted as if he had  just occurred  it was the most natural thing  in the world  was to him  would you like something to eat 
[01:03:00]  he asked  the kitchen's right there  no thank you  no thank you Mr. President  he called a car  to pick her up  and take her home  on the ride home  it kept echoing  in my head  I'm not a virgin anymore  holy fuck  yeah how about  you're not a virgin anymore  and Jack Kennedy  took your fucking virginity  the next week  she was again  invited to go swimming  he barely acknowledged  my arrival  betraying no hint  of what had happened  between us 
[01:03:30]  just a few days before  I couldn't bring myself  to look him in the eye  she writes  later he led her  into a different bedroom  this was the beginning  of our affair  their sex was varied  and fun  he could be seductive  and playful at times  and sometimes acted  like he had all the time  in the world  other times  he was in no mood  to linger  he just needed to cum  they spent an inordinate  amount of times  taking baths  because  and he changed his shirt  six times a day  because he hated  feeling sweaty or grimy  I think he probably  had a B.O. problem 
[01:04:00]  sweaty Boston drunk  just sweating out  the fucking whiskey  but what it was  he was probably  fucking so many  different girls  and he didn't want  the stink of some  other chick's twat on him  and you know  that big hairy  early 60's bush  they didn't even  touch it as far as  any kind of manicuring  how did you have  time for politics  hell of fuck  well he promised  he would call later  under the pseudonym  Michael Carter  Michael Carter  and then he played  a recording of  Nat King Call's  Autumn Leaves  he made her concentrate 
[01:04:30]  on the lyrics  even JF Case  listen to the words  this is the part  that I think  is pertinent  to our situation  when Nat says  I'm fucking  you'll keep your mouth  shut  or I'll have you  killed like Marilyn  listen to the lyrics  Marilyn Monroe  was so killed  so killed by the  Kennedys  it all makes sense  really  she wanted a yap  as a parting gift  she gave him  a copy of the record 
[01:05:00]  and trimmed the cover  and chlamydia  yes  wait you didn't  in a paternity suit  you didn't say  the words  from Autumn Leaves  but I miss  he made her  concentrate on the lyrics  but I miss you  most of all  my darling  when autumn leaves  start to fall  you're not singing  it like Nat King Cole  but I miss you  most of all  me darling  when autumn leaves  start to fall  I mean you can see  how a white girl  can fall for him  in person  as a parting gift  she gave him  a copy of the record  and trimmed the cover  with leaves 
[01:05:30]  she had collected  apparently  she was a retard girl  yeah really  collecting leaves  on the White House lawn  what else did she give him  a macaroni  glued to a paper plate  he made her  fucking stalker patty  he made her  decoupage  yeah decoupage  no she made him  yeah  oh she made him  this is beautiful  throw this in the trash  you're trying to make me cry  he told her  I'm not trying to make you cry  Mr. President  she said  I'm trying to make you  remember me  within a week  of her return to collage  she got a call from 
[01:06:00]  wink  Michael Carter  Michael Carter here  he asked dozens of questions  what courses were you taking  do you like your teachers  are you fucking any negroes  were the girls interesting  do you have any friends  who will eat my ass  what did she have for dinner  he then invited her  to the Washington  to Washington  when Jackie  was away  yes my wife's in Greece  meeting a shipping 
[01:06:30]  guru  magnate  who shall be fucking  after my brains  are scattered all over  Dealey Plaza  my wife's making plans  for the future  a car service  would pick her up  and drive her to the airport  where a paid ticket to DC  would be waiting for her  nice  yes  I have a lot of miles  on Continental  upon arrival  a chauffeur  holding a sign up  for Michael Carter  would take her  to the White House 
[01:07:00]  on one visit  he was in the middle  of the most defining  moment of his presidency  the Cuban Missile Crisis  although historians  have dissected  Kennedy's actions  none were privy  to what he confided  to Mimi  oh shit  he said  I'd rather my children  red than dead  he told her  oh wow  it was a chilling insight  when the president  wasn't keeping the world  from descending into war  there was plenty  of wild partying  one instance  was a raucous  Hollywood bash 
[01:07:30]  at Bing Crosby's ranch  oh buh buh buh  they just knocked  around women together  yeah  ah you mind  if I punch you  in the face  yes  hey Bing  could you bring  your children in here  I'd like to knock  them around a little  I lost the money  on the Sox game  my fat friend  won't even watch  the Patriots play  he broke his knee man  I was sitting next to him  in the  I was sitting next to him  in the living room  when a handful  of yellow capsules  most likely 
[01:08:00]  amyl nitrate  commonly known  as poppers  was offered up  by one of the guests  the president  asked me  if I wanted  to try the drug  which stimulated  the heart  but also purportedly  enhanced sex  I said no  but he just went ahead  and popped the capsule  and held it under my nose  he didn't try it himself  Kennedy had her  doing poppers  poppers  it wasn't her first glimpse  of Kennedy's dark side  oh  he had been guilty  of an even more callous  and unforgivable episode  at the White House 
[01:08:30]  during a noon swim  so amazing  Dave Powers  had rolled up his pants  to cool his feet  in the water  the president swam over  and whispered in my ear  Mr. Powers  looks a little tense  would you take care of it  oh my god  this guy is great  it was a dare  this guy  you mean JFK  JFK  what a good friend  holy fuck  you know  it was a dare  my friend  my friend wants to charge me  to have his wife  look at my script  look what JFK was doing 
[01:09:00]  it was a dare  it was a dare  but I knew exactly  what he meant  that was a challenge  to give Dave Powers  oral sex  I didn't think  the president  thought I'd do it  but I'm ashamed  to say that I did  yeah you sucked that dick  the president  silently watched  wow what the fuck  Alfred then  Mimi Beardsley  Mimi Beardsley  Beardsley  said that later  the president  apologized to them both  ah  ha  Mimi Beardsley  she could suck

[01:10:30]  yes  sounds like a  Harry Potter character  you remember  Bessie Hairlip  she sucks dick  even better  than Bessie Hairlip  oh  Diana Prolapse  was a good  blowjob giver  but Mimi Beardsley  really knows  how to pull  the cum  out of your balls  Dave  trust old  Mike Carter here  holy fuck  she'll have  your cum  splattered  all over  for years

[01:13:30]  I guarantee you  there's some in her  book  one of her just  sucking fucking  Kennedy's dick  hopefully yeah  I wonder how big  his dick was  I hope she says  he probably had  a massive hug  he was Irish  he probably had  five and a half  six  you think  yeah  pretend it's a lot  bigger  make a lot of  noise when I  stick it in  I have to  shower again  I have armpit  odor  and I'm all hot  because I wear  a back brace  and that makes  me grimy  yeah he did  wear that brace  yes he did  that's why  he couldn't  slump down  when he got  shot  when he was  shot 
[01:14:00]  when you see  Kennedy  he grabs his  throat  and he kind  there's a very  weird motion  he makes  in the limo  where he kind  of ducks  it almost looks  like he's  leaning on a  fence  he had a  back brace  and he couldn't  just collapse  oh he could  have fucking  laid down  in the seat  or something  maybe he wouldn't  have gotten  that shot  wouldn't have  come  yeah some  people say  that fucked  him up  oh man  obviously a  different time  I was shooting  Mimi in the  head  all the shit  was going on  and no one  was talking  yep  nobody  Oswald did  to me exactly  what I did  to Mimi  except I did 
[01:14:30]  more damage  I blew a wig  right off  oh Mimi  Beardsdale  Miss Beardsley  I love to  fuck a face  that's named  after a man's  facial hair  it's like  reminds me  of Dan  Haggerty  my wife's  got a big  Greek shipping  magnate  cock  buried in  her throat  right now  I bet  fucking  Onassis  loved ass  play  of course  he did  and his  cock was 
[01:15:00]  probably  big headed  and fat  oh god damn  yeah  like a diner  cook  I heard  that Aristotle's  cock was like  nine by six  and it like  would really  tip left  and he would  look at her  and go  what's that  remind you of  do they explain  why she kept  the story secret  for so many  fucking years  I think it's  just because  she's a good  girl  I live with  that story  wasn't a TMZ  wasn't a TMZ  country 
[01:15:30]  we didn't  well there has  been for a while  now though  you would assume  this would have  came out  before  maybe she  didn't want  the hubby  to know  she was fucking  this is almost  50 years ago  when they were  still dating  and getting ready  to be married  remember I told  you that you  were my first  to her husband  oh god that's  right she probably  was a virgin  and told the guy  yeah well I haven't  done that I'm  waiting for marriage  and there's  fucking Jack  just pounding  her fresh pussy  you always wonder  why her fucking  she had like a  fucking lipstick  was smeared  her breath smelled  like what was it  4711  whatever apple 
[01:16:00]  cologne  what kind of  what is that  like high karate  yeah it hasn't  been around since  yeah it's probably  smells like money  Kennedy might have  got himself killed  because he was  fooling around  with the wrong broad  oh man  what the fuck  I bet his bed  I bet his bed  looked like the  fucking seat  in the limo  fucking that cherry  that's why they  cleaned it up so  quickly they were  just so used to  Kennedy making a  mess back there  they took him  to the hospital  didn't even know  what was wrong  yeah what's the  matter  blood in the seat  yeah it happens  all the time  exactly fucks a  lot of virgins  back there  do we need to 
[01:16:30]  clean our hiney  yeah usually they  are wiping shit  and intern tears  off that seat  Mimi Beardsley  worst name ever  get me a woman  with a horrible  name  blow my friend  Dave in the pool  his feet are  being cooled off  he's just  dipping his  tootsies in the  pool  if you thought  Anthony  Cormier was a  piece of shit  as a host  I'll have you  suck my friend's  car  at least he'll 
[01:17:00]  just get drunk  and repeat  himself  I'm having a  Super Bowl  party  we're gonna  karaoke  well you're  gonna karaoke  I'm gonna have  Mimi Beardsley  eating Robert's  asshole upstairs  hey I'd like you  to jerk my  brother off in the  kitchen of the  ambassador hotel  would you do  that for me  just jerk him  off into it  you're gonna love 
[01:17:30]  Mimi Bobby  you're gonna love  her  oh my god  she better have  been hot with  that name  yeah it's just  terrible  getting her  through any  doors  just don't  repeat any of  the jokes I've  been telling you  Mimi he's  partial to the  Negroes  well fuck I  think we just  took on book  radio  I'll bet you  that they  fucked girls  together  Bobby and  Jack  wow  that would be  a biggie 
[01:18:00]  me and Florentine  I pulled trains  with Voss  you'd hope that  Jack and Bobby  Kennedy pulled  trains together  now you know  why Marilyn Monroe  died  she couldn't keep  her fucking  mouth shut  like the rest  of them  jibber jabbering  about fucking  the Kennedys  she was probably  the one that  said I'm coming  forward with this  shit  and she's one  that supposedly  had sex with  both of them  maybe not at the  same time  but she was  fucking mobbing  and fucking  JFK  it's absolutely  true  oh god  DiMaggio's  just all pissed  off about it  yeah  I bet you 
[01:18:30]  he'd punch her  that's why he  abused her  he'd fucking  knock her teeth  out every time  they fucking  showed a clip  of Kennedy  13 days of the  missile crisis  every time he  was up there  they breathe  the same air  Marilyn gonna  shine her  she's cringing  that the state  of the union  is coming on  she just knows  it's like a  sound thrashing  with a Louisville  slugger  Camelot was  bullshit  yeah  old jolting 
[01:19:00]  Joe DiMaggio  just pounding  her in the face  anything that  reminded him  of the fact  that she one  time kissed  him after coming  from JFK's  library  he just aimed  for that mole  on her face  that's why  he drank coffee  because he wanted  the taste of  Jack's cum  and he wanted  to have coffee  breath  because that  long way to go  well it's good  though  shit  they all knew  how to keep  secrets back then  yeah  well if they  didn't they  ended up  in the hotel  well the press  was better  though too  drug overdose 
[01:19:30]  huh  because none  of that stuff  really is news  who gives a fuck  if an intern  sucks his dick  well one guy  from the press  you would think  would have said  something  it's amazing  they all kept  quiet like  you just didn't  do it back  then man  we can't even  comprehend that  with the world  we live in now  wow  very good Jimmy  that's a hell  of a story  I want to read  the book  we gotta interview  her man  I mean that's  that'd be cool  yeah can we get her  we'd love to talk  to her  Jack's cock size  you think she'd  talk about that  no she wouldn't  she's an older lady  but I got  she's blue blood  I'd squeeze in  the question  somehow  somehow 
[01:20:00]  yeah just word it  in a way  where maybe she  you know  hey did it hurt  yeah  how long after  like let me  I don't know  how I say this  respectfully  how long after  his head came off  did your vagina  finally get wet again  like every time  you were touched  after that  like whenever  your husband  would rub your clit  would you just  think of that  shot ringing out  behind the  Stemmons freeway sign  do you imagine  she's fucking a guy  for 18 months  man  the best looking  most powerful guy 
[01:20:30]  on the planet  yeah  and then just to see  a murdered light  although they didn't  see it for 5 years  the American public  didn't see the  secruder tape  until probably 68  when she was 19  she wasn't telling  all her friends  yeah  you gotta think  she was yakking  I guarantee you  there's one or two  she told  and no one  believed her probably  or they just knew  better than  they kept their mouth  shut  and once he got  shot  you just  who's that  Marilyn Monroe  and Reagan  that's Reagan  oh does Reagan  fuck you too  oh man  yeah  Marilyn  pull down  those panties  why else 
[01:21:00]  would she be there  if you think about it  the fucking  starts in 5 minutes  yes  and I pulled up  my balls  and they brushed  the face of Marilyn  see everything  he did later  he just said  earlier to Marilyn  wish I could do Reagan  yes  that was a perfect Reagan  people are like  you're not gonna  address Jimmy's  awful Boston accent  are you kidding me  it's a great Boston accent  it sounds just like him  close your eyes  you'd think it was him  fucking perfect  yeah  Shaw 
[01:21:30]  Shaw  what was wrong  with that accent  that's gotta be the best  of what's in the book  though  I can't imagine  there's anything else  in the book  I could read  any details about that  I wanna read  I would like to hear  about the Beardsley childhood  what it was like  growing up in the Beardsley house  yeah  what was it like  you think it starts  with all that bullshit  oh of course  I was young  born to the Beardsley family  her path to the White House  yes  how she got there  Snoresville  her dumb fucking  boyfriend Tony  that cuck  presidential cuck 
[01:22:00]  you know she used that  in an argument  we were talking about it  behind the scenes  well I fucked the president  they probably had  some kind of heated argument  and she fucking  broke that doozy out  yeah  broke that one out  god damn  Jack Kennedy  the more I hear about him  the more I just love him  oh what a great guy  better red than dead  yeah  he's ready to give up  if he's getting that done  without showing any nerves  you gotta think  he was knocking them back  left and right  and he's president 
[01:22:30]  during a pretty tumultuous  time in history  and he's there  just knocking them  knocking them down  setting them up  and knocking them down  which proves the time  wasn't that tumultuous  is what I'm thinking  ah the commies  who gives a shit  bring me a virgin  he had all that shit  under control  in the end  yeah  no I bet you  knew exactly  what the fuck  he was doing  it was probably  tumultuous  because of what  he was doing  they're like  Mr. President  we've been telling you  for two weeks  about these fucking  Russian ships  in the ocean  well how close  are they to Cuba  oh no I forgot about that 
[01:23:00]  Mimi Beardsley  had two fingers  in my asshole  she said there was  fecal matter  in her fingernails  oh you did mention that  I forgot about it  it's Irish now  it's Irish  I love it  wait how close  are the boats to Cuba  oh fuck  my dick smells like  Mimi Beardsley  if you launch  an attack at us  I will aim  directly at Russia  alright thank you  goodnight  is Mimi in the car  I'd like my asshole  licked  you think he'd just 
[01:23:30]  let it get closer  and closer  he forgot about it  he didn't know  I think I got a little  more time here  yeah  get it in one more time  yeah  that's why he didn't  fucking put  that's why there was  no fucking bubble top  in Dallas  I want to text Mimi  and I can't text it  with the bubble tops  I get no service  in Dallas  I want to send  a mimeograph  to Mimi  while I'm driving  a mimeograph  a mimeograph  to Mimi Beardsley  are you sure  he didn't say  better dead than red  a lot of people  are saying that 
[01:24:00]  yes  that's why  there was a  chilling insight  yeah  because it was  alright  because publicly  he was saying  he was just bluffing  like  I'd rather see  them red than dead  if the Rooshkis  knew that he wasn't  going to  really do this whole  you know  mutual destruction  thing  Mimi  yeah  their children  breathe the same  air as our children  which smells  a lot of times  like my cologne  mixed with semen  and virgin blood  on the sheets  a little speck  of copper  with cum 
[01:24:30]  all over it  that's what it  smells like  Russian children  will breathe that in  ich bin ein  stinky dick  I believe in this  decad  we will go to the moon  and I will be blown  by Mimi Beardsley  and do those other things  we'll either go to the moon  or I'll put my penis  in some nice  arse cheeks  while a girl is mooning  in the pool  could you finger Dave

[01:30:00]  oh Mimi Beardsley  oh Mimi Beardsley  oh Mimi Beardsley  this  Opie and Anthony's 
[01:30:30]  worst of 2012  so far  worst of 2012  so far  Opie and Anthony  show  my name is  E-Rock  still to come  Nicolas Cage  will be in studio  Ice-T will be in studio  Rich Voss is going  to attempt to sing  we check out  what Uncle Paul's  doing with the  Sandusky trial  he's really distraught  Sam lost a bet  something's going to  happen  but for right now  in this segment  we just had legendary  basketball player  and actor  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  he was just on the  show promoting  his new book  and we thought  everything went great  but there was some  stuff behind the 
[01:31:00]  scenes during the  interview that was  making it very  uncomfortable for the  staff  Kareem's publicist  was not liking  the fact that we  were not just  talking about the  book only  we were talking  about him as a  person  getting to know  him  talking about his  infamous basketball  career  but she just  wanted to talk  about the book  and was getting  really upset  that's not what  we were doing  so she wanted  to redirect  the conversation  that the hosts  were having  we weren't going  to allow it  we discussed  everything right  here  and Kevin Smith  is also there  chiming in 
[01:31:30]  and here it is  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2012  so far  we got Kevin Smith  in studio  got a dummy  on Twitter  or a dummy  on incident  and feedback  he writes  he goes  Kevin Smith  for what  20 minutes  now  Kareem in studio  I mean come  on dude  I know you  don't care  anymore  but this is  crazy  I was just  getting into  Kevin Smith  he hasn't been  on in a long  time  what an asshole  what an idiot  that's right  here  Kevin's mic  has to be  on there  what an idiot  can I join 
[01:32:00]  of course  Kevin came in  at 8  and we had  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  at 830  so you gotta  stop everything  to talk to  Kareem for a while  and then you  know we're  gonna go back  to Kevin  for the legend  you know what I'm  saying  that man's a  living legend  and we were just  talking about  on the break  this is a dude  who when you  watch him  he has the  quiet grace  of one of the  lucky few  whose dream  came true  beyond measure  and then he  eventually had to  put it down  and start a  whole new life  you know you  always look at  people like  oh they wanted  to do this  and they got it  but then  they say that 
[01:32:30]  athletes and  beautiful women  die two deaths  you know  sooner or later  that thing that  fuels you  you gotta give up  so it's amazing  to watch a dude  sit there with  quiet statesman  like grace  know that he  achieved his dream  and eventually  had to put it  on a shelf  his amazing  career  ended at 42  yeah  that is so  fucking young  you start realizing  when you get a  little older  and when he  talked about  he was playing  that's why  I was asking  what grade  did you start  playing  he's fourth  grade  fourth grade  and like  who knows  when the  dreams of  playing pro  starts  by ninth grade 
[01:33:00]  I read a lot  on Lou Alcindor  when he was  Lou Alcindor  back then  that's what I  wanted to ask  too when I was  a kid I had  these little  like I don't  know what it  was called  it was this  like I think  Kenner or  Hasbro made it  or Mattel  it looked like  a walkie-talkie  it was brown  and it had a  back pocket  and you put  these little  records into it  and the records  had pictures on  them and there  was one for  Bobby Orr  and there was  one for a  basketball player  named Lou Alcindor  and you'd put  these in  and they would  play and you  would listen  kind of like a  CNC to a  pre-recorded 
[01:33:30]  sports story  of like a  minute long  that was like  Lou Alcindor  and they gave  you a complete  biography  and it would  end with  Lou Alcindor  and you would  hear the crowd  go wow  I totally  on a little  record  do you have  a bare  recollection  of that toy  I haven't  thought about  that forever  but yes  now I need  to know the  name of that  I had that  a primitive  iPod  that only did  sports  one minute  sports segments  but that was  I mean you  step aside  for living  legend like  that  that dude's  like Stan Lee  like one of  these people  it's just like  he's been here 
[01:34:00]  how old you say  he was  he's 64  okay 64  he's seen a lot  of history  and he's been  living history  he stands there  before he was  living history  by the time  he was in  9th grade  they pretty much  knew he was  going to be  a pro basketball  player for real  that's  they knew that  early  with him  so  oh yeah  and then at 42  you have to say  goodbye  and then figure out  the rest of your life  this is my one  observation  from being in the room  with him  yeah  he does not  he's over  hearing how tall  he is  I know  oh you can pick  that up in a second  he never wants 
[01:34:30]  to hear somebody  be like  what's the weather  like  or Jesus  you're tall  or what the  man  he's just like  I'm 64  I've been hearing this  since I was 9  stop it  yeah  yeah  I'm tall  you gotta think  if he's 64  he's lost a couple inches  he almost hit the ceiling  in here  not only does he not look  like he didn't lose  we said it in front of him  he fucking looks  ageless  that is true  he's surreal looking  in person  like when he comes in  you feel like  there's a man being  carried in on something  like he's that large 
[01:35:00]  I said it looked like  the guy from  the Close Encounter  ship  the last guy  that comes out  bang  I was going for  the quiet grace  of Chewy  he had a real  Chewy-like  statesmanship  was it  Pat from Monaki  was it the Gaff  or the GAF  Viewmaster  it wasn't  I remember the Gaff  or the GAF  Viewmaster  but that was more  of a visual  oriented toy  that you looked into  some of the GAFs  could project  this was strictly  I believe it's Mattel  hard plastic  brown  and like dark 
[01:35:30]  orange in color  it had a speaker  in the front  I forget what  the design was  it had this  push button thing  on the side  that was half  a white disc  of some sort  you would push it in  and that would play  the record inside  and it was just  the one I had  just sports stories  someone's saying  sports talk by tops  but  that's not it  yeah alright  well  I think we gotta go back  to the Kareem thing  go ahead  it's interesting  go ahead  Kenny ran in here  without bashing anybody  Kenny ran in here  and said that Kareem  was getting a talking to  and then we all 
[01:36:00]  looked down the hall  and he was  he was getting a talking  to right down the hall  that was a lambasting  from what I saw  I guess it's a PR person  I'm thinking publicist  the way these dudes  reacted  apparently  he would like  the color went out  of Opie's face  he was just like  Kareem's getting yelled at  it was fucked up  he was standing in the hall  no one yells at Kareem  and there was yelling  going on  and then I realized  wait he can take care  of himself  he doesn't need my shit  but here's some  Kenny take care of himself  he's a gentle soul  that's the thing  when you talk to him  he's kind of like  I don't want to  fuck us  you know 
[01:36:30]  you could see him  taking it  rather than being like  shut up  is that her right there  no  that's Roland  he must like him  I think she built him  for a while  so she must do  Kenny said something  Roland said something  what was she dressing him down about  Roland told me  you need to get Spencer  on the air  supposedly she was banned  from this building  she's like a problem  where's Kenny  and where's Roland  she was very  I think she was annoyed  at the line of questions  which she doesn't understand  and this is just  but I think as a publicist  she should shout out 
[01:37:00]  we're talking to Kareem  about the sky hook  and he was great  the sky hook  and martial arts  and all this stuff  which P.S.  when that happened  he lit up  he was happy to talk about it  you could sit there  and listen to him  and he was very eloquent  on everything  but when he talked about  the sky hook  there was a certain energy  that hadn't been present  in the entire interview  because he's like  oh great  yeah  like I like talking  about this  passion  what PR people  don't understand  is you know  of course we're going  to get to the new project  but if you just talk  about the new project  the whole time  you're going to lose listeners  so what you try to do 
[01:37:30]  is we have to make it  interesting for our audience  we don't want to lose them  and then that means  you're going to  have more people  listening about the book  and also  logically it makes sense  right  you can't just talk  about the book  for 20 minutes  it's a kid's book  now are there plenty  of parents out there  that would buy it  honestly yeah  but we're also marketing  this to people  who are like me  I'm not a parent  but you know what  I would absolutely  go and buy this  to have Kareem sign it  I bought books  I wasn't going to read  Henry Winkler  the first time I met  Henry Winkler  I bought his book  just so he would sign it 
[01:38:00]  it's a kid's book  a lot of people do that  because they like the artist  or they like the person  so it's like  we're also interviewing you  for his fans  who will go out  and buy the fucking book  of course  and somebody's sitting there  listening to that  Skyhook story  is just like  oh my god  I remember like  if you're old enough  and you've got some kids  you're going  I remember watching him do that  I like listening to him  talk about that  you're more inclined  to jump onto Amazon  and buy the buff course  publicists never quite understand  they don't  this is something  I've always believed in  you come in  the less you talk about  what you're quote unquote 
[01:38:30]  there to promote  the better it is for it  all you have to do  your only job  is to go in there  and be interesting  because if you're interesting  then they'll start  looking you up  and whatnot  but when you go in  pushing something  down their throats  people are immediately  like I'm being sold  I watched the interview  you guys did  with Paris Hilton  he was a delight  oh my god  it was painful  and it's just like  in this transaction  nobody wins  you guys won  because it's a good video  but nobody  she don't win  nobody's going to  buy that book  when she sits there  her reality show  and it got knocked 
[01:39:00]  off the air  it was a reality show  did you get to the part  of Daryl Hammond's book  about Paris Hilton  where she was the biggest  twat who hosted SNL  she was the biggest  twat that ever hosted SNL  didn't want to meet  with the writers  like these Emmy  award winning writers  I guess the process  with SNL  you're the host  you come in  and now you go  from office to office  and they got these ideas  and they have won  all sorts of awards  they're trying to make  you look good  and she was  Daryl Hammond overheard her  saying how many more  of these do I have to do  she really is the vapid cunt  that you think she's going to be  I hate to say that  I wish she wasn't 
[01:39:30]  I watched every minute  of that video  because you were  fucking trying dude  it was valiant  how much you were  putting into it  because it would have been  so easy within the first minute  to just be like  fuck this  and start cutting and running  we were trying to be  on her best behavior  because she's an easy target  like it doesn't take much  to berate Paris Hilton  so I'm like  fuck it  let's give her a real interview  be nice to her  try to say  don't be what she expects  she walked into the room  and she expected  a bunch of dudes  she sucked  she sucked 
[01:40:00]  she sucked  she gave nothing  let's get back to the current day  did you have a thought  I'm sorry  Kareem on the other hand  gave something  in regards to the doc  it was interesting  in regards to the book  but no doubt  when he started talking about  the skyhook  he lit up  he lit up  but you also notice  he doesn't like talking about his height  except  look  he wasn't a tough man to read  by the stretch of the imagination  stay away from the height  let's talk about it  it's hard not to say something  Kenny what happened 
[01:40:30]  don't hold back  what did you hear  right after the interview  nothing  I was just taken back  the way that lady  like took Kareem aside  and was like  she was yelling at him  right  yelling at him  scolding him  you don't talk about the skyhook  you don't talk about fourth grade  all you talk about is the book  that's what we're here to promote  is the book  I think that's bad advice  that's very bad  terrible advice  that's worse advice than  yes Adolf  you have a good idea  to go into Germany  and it's cold out  I meant to say  fucking Russia  god damn history jokes  I always blow them 
[01:41:00]  but it was the way  she was saying it  she was yelling at him  Eric's got a better story  than me  Eric what happened  I'm sorry  I was just watching him  and see if he was getting  yelled at again  as he came out of  Shave 45  where are they now  they're in the hallway  right here next to us  I just want to look at it  what's she doing  she's on the phone  and she's looking over  the legal agreement  what  that's smart  before they sign it  she wants to make sure  she should be very happy though  because his segment  turned into almost a double segment 
[01:41:30]  he's not even here  and he's got some ink  what a class act  an unbelievable class act  he was great  he didn't mind talking  about any of that stuff  Eric you have a story though  what did she do to you  she was in there with you  yeah  and she was bitching  and complaining  the second she walked in here  you were only three minutes  into the interview  and she was saying  they're past seven minutes already  we've got to wrap this up  and to the credit  of the blonde publicist  that was here  who was trying to control  the brunette publicist  she was saying  they just started talking  we've got time  don't worry about it 
[01:42:00]  and then when  again you brought up  him in junior high  the skyhook  all this stuff  that wasn't book centric  she kept going  why are they talking about this  why is he talking about that  and then she started saying  I need to speak to every host  from the next interviews  that we do  to let them know  what they can and can't talk  oh yeah  hosts love that  by the way  please get her in here  oh dude  hosts love that  with respect for him  I won't yell at her  because for whatever reason  he has her  and she didn't yell at us 
[01:42:30]  well  he didn't look happy  after the dress down  yeah I mean whatever  if that's how she wants  to conduct business  fine  but in my perspective  you let him go in  and talk to what makes him happiest  and that'll sell whatever  you're trying to sell  he probably doesn't understand  she just gave us a lot  he doesn't understand  probably how  what a bad job  she's doing for him  in that way  Roland's handling  he wants a pit bull too  maybe  somebody would go in  and be like  get me in and out  Roland what do you  what do you know  about this lady  um  she's intense  oh Jesus 
[01:43:00]  really  what's going on  she's the worst  oh that was such  a great interview  in there  such difference  she just said that  get her in here  what on the other interview  please get her  at one point  it's not like we mentioned  AIDS and the Man of Johnson  no we gave a better interview  wait wait wait  I don't know what Sway  she walked out of the Sway interview  saying like  that was so much better  why  because was it all about the book  what  no  probably not  it's probably because  it was a black host  interviewing him about black  um  but again  it was short  it was very short 
[01:43:30]  but that's a publicist  giving terrible advice  because again  if you don't understand  that we have a really large audience  and our audience  would like to hear from Kareem  and sure  we mentioned the book  he also wanted  that other thing plugged  and I was happy to plug that  and I actually saw it  yeah  I want a copy of that  anyone have a copy of that  um  do you have a copy of that  I might sell my copy  sure  worst publicist ever  yeah  yeah she's rough  because that's  her only client's Kareem  and what  she got banned  from the building  last time  or something  you're telling me  yeah they threw her out  they threw her out 
[01:44:00]  for what  she barged in  yeah she was getting ready  to start coming in here  if anything has questions  oh I wish she came in  she would have barged in  god I wish she came in  I felt bad  because I just let her in there  with Eric  so she could torture Eric  I had to scream  and get Roland in here  to run interference  on this lady  because she was leaning  over the board here  and you know  when we have to wrap up  the publicist said  we have five minutes  whatever  I tell you guys  in your headphones  hey we have five minutes  or he has to go  so you know  she kept saying  well why aren't they wrapping up  Jimmy would ask another question  and she'd start losing her shit 
[01:44:30]  and then Jimmy would  keep talking again  they're not plugging the book  why does he keep going on  about this  I think this is around the time  when you started asking about  talking about the skyhook  and she goes  you need to tell them  so I'm pretending  I'm hitting the buttons  that I'm telling you guys  in the headphones  and I kept telling her  I'm like  I don't know what you want me to do  I told them  they know  and she's sitting there  and she goes  well what are we going to do  the hosts aren't listening to you  and I said  there's nothing we can do  she wants to  barge in here  she goes  well how do we go in there  and stop this 
[01:45:00]  I go  we don't  what are we doing  beating him up  that's where you failed  you should have let her  come in man  you know that would be good  no my picture wouldn't have  got signed  at that point you go  look I can't stop him  you better get in there  this was too big a guest  for you guys  we got what we needed  if it was somebody  of lesser status  next time let him come in  but this was too big  and I wasn't going to  let her in  let her come in  but do you see  Paris Hilton's publicist  was also awful  like she didn't realize  that like  we were really nice to Paris 
[01:45:30]  we had a good time  with Kareem  we tried  we  and it's like  it's amazing  how what  pegs publicist  in general  as a rule can be  like your job  is not  to be the  jealous  center of attention  your job  is to represent  your client  and guide your client  in a smart way  to promote their product  and to promote them  it's not to be  the spoiled star yourself  because you're not  the interesting one  right  which again  to the flip side  a lot of people 
[01:46:00]  stand behind their people  they want pit bulls  so they can be like  you beat a bad guy  I don't want to beat a bad guy  and you sit there  shrug like  I would love to stay  yell like hey man  I'm on a tight schedule  I understand that  but getting yelled at  in the hallway  that one I've never seen  in a million years  but a pit bull  who gives bad advice  that's the problem  well Kareem will figure  that shit out  he's smart enough  to figure it out  in the end  is Spencer around  for his story?  he had to get another guess  okay  and I love Twitter  Queen Elizabeth on Twitter  who  you know 
[01:46:30]  I've seen her tweets  and I like her  just the cluelessness  of this tweet  I got blocked  by Paris Hilton  because I wished  her uncle  Nikki Hilton  was alive  and would kick out  her uterus  and then the hashtag  is sensitive content  like she doesn't understand  why Paris Hilton  would block her for that  why would I get blocked  now Roland  yes  this publicist  did she  inform Sway  what he can and cannot  talk about  because I heard  when she  got Kareem out of here 
[01:47:00]  she was going to tell  all the rest of the hosts  that are doing interviews  what they can and can't  talk about  oh she was in there  blabbering  she was  oh yeah yeah  I'd love to hear  and she goes  don't make sure  to promote the book  and don't forget  that he's with  Hillary Clinton  don't forget  that  and he's like  yeah  yeah we got all that out  you dumb fuck  of course we did  it was the stupidest stuff  that she was getting mad at  you talking about him  in junior high  this was nothing offensive  or detract from the interview  and that's what she started  screaming  it's all interesting  stuff we asked  you're talking about 
[01:47:30]  a guy that in ninth grade  they pretty much knew  was going to be in the NBA  and that you weren't  plugging enough  the blonde publicist  kept saying  Jimmy just did the plug  you're yelling  and not even listening  to what's going on  and Jimmy will plug  and she said  Jim will plug it again  at the end of the interview  which you did  I know how to plug  and I know the value of plug  and I was happy to do it  but it doesn't serve him  or the audience well  to every two seconds go  so you're a basketball  oh the book  oh the book  nobody wants to just hear  that's kind of hard  about  you know what I mean 
[01:48:00]  you got to mix it up  with a real interview  yeah of course  the blonde said  they have to work it in  they have to humanize  the interview  yeah exactly  because we're not doing  a five minute TV spot  get them on QVC  if you want that shit  radio is different  than television  getting to the soul  of a person  is going to sell  far more of whatever  that person wants to sell  absolutely  they're just sitting there  empty formalism  saying I have a book  I have this video  these are where you can  get them and what not  you got to get to know  somebody a little bit  especially in this  try before you buy 
[01:48:30]  a culture man  like most people are like  I want to be a little  invested in this guy  before I put my hard  earned money up  not everyone has a lot  of spending cash right now  so hearing about his life  going to the place of  like let's talk about  something that is you  and only you  a signature  that has lasted  in sport long  after you've been there  is the smart  fucking play  anybody that doesn't see  that not good  at their fucking job  I think she knows  who she's handling  thanks Kevin  it's like fucked up  but he's completely right  yeah of course  that is exactly what it is  you got some  Spencer's there 
[01:49:00]  so I was asking  Sam to grab Spencer  because I saw you  get all excited  Spencer  Spencer  they can't hear us out there  thanks for the call there sir  let's get Tony in Cleveland  hey  how's it going this morning guys  hey  what do you got  I don't want to lose Spencer  I saw a  oh you want to come on the air  no I'm getting the story  oh alright  alright sorry  go ahead Tony  hey I saw a documentary  years ago  about the whole UCLA run  and wooden and all that  and they talked about 
[01:49:30]  Kareem  when he was  first got to UCLA  he drew some fire  from the press  because he made  some comments  about you know  the 68 Olympics  with a black fist in the air  and with all the stuff  that was going on  with the Vietnam War  and it was barely anything  he said  he just you know  they asked him  he basically said  that he you know  he thought those guys  were right for putting  their fists in the air  and all this  and then next thing you know  it got blown in  that he's a you know  a black panther  and all this  so John Wooden  pulled him aside  and said look  you are such a  there's such a huge 
[01:50:00]  spotlight on you  everything you say  is going to be twisted  so ever since then  he's kind of shied away  from the press  and everybody labeled him  as you know  being an asshole  and all this  well after he retired  they come to him  and you know  that's when you know  the whole pot thing  was going on  and the MPA  and they brought it up  to him  and he said  well you know  I smoked pot  what's the big deal  yeah I gotta tell you  we all heard those stories  over the years  we got  we were lucky enough  to talk to him  for what  maybe a half hour  I saw a really nice  sweet guy  right Jimmy 
[01:50:30]  yeah he was very pleasant  like I was expecting  a guy that would be  a little you know  fucking intimidating  abrasive  yeah besides his height  just an intimidating  individual  he wasn't that at all  I wanted to tell him  that I do the skyhook  a lot but without the ball  I just walk around  making the skyhook motion  Sam you got the story  from Spencer  yeah  we're going back  to Kareem's publicist  who pretty much  gave him a talking to  after our interview  was yelling at him  which by the way  most people thought  it was a really good interview  so  what's up  what are you gonna do 
[01:51:00]  last time he was here  he was doing Mad Dog  and she didn't know  who Mad Dog was  and they were talking  about the Lakers  and stuff  obviously on Mad Dog  Sports  and I guess he was  promoting another book  or something  I'm not sure  maybe the documentary  when it came out  he was promoting  the documentary  on the Rens  my teeth are clenched  and she started  freaking out at Spencer  saying I'm gonna go in  there and stop this  they're talking about  basketball  they're not talking  about the movie  he's not just  plugging the movie  he's talking about  we're not here  talking about the Lakers  and Spencer has to go 
[01:51:30]  no no no  you can't go in  just let this one go  and the other ones  will be blah blah blah  and she goes  alright  and then  they went to do  Covino and Rich next  and two minutes  into the interview  when they talked  about the Lakers  instead of just  plug plug plug plug  she said  I'm going in there  this time  and Spencer had to  stand in front of the door  and say you're gonna have  to physically remove me  wow  he then had to get  call his boss  and call the head  of security  and say we need to  throw this lady  out of the building  wow  he said it was 
[01:52:00]  the most difficult  afternoon of his  professional life  he said this  this booking  and Spencer said  she's banned  from the building  and this  this morning  when this booking  was made  Spencer said  yes  you know  of course we'll take Kareem  but she can't come  with him  absolutely not  and so  at 6am  they say  she's gonna come  with him  she'll be on her  best behavior  and Spencer says  absolutely not  she can't come  in the building  and they said  well we're gonna  cancel him  from O&A 
[01:52:30]  and from Sway  if she can't  come in the building  oh boy  so that's why  that's the only reason  she was up here  wow  because he would've  let him cancel  yeah because he didn't  want to lose  no that was cool  that was very cool  and for Sway  but again  that's  that's her  so I'm here  to protect you  but how embarrassing  for him  that his publicist  is doing him  a disservice  he's done  Mad Dog's show  and she doesn't want him  to talk about sports  yeah  she's horrible  I would love to  write him an email  if I can get Kareem's email 
[01:53:00]  I don't know how to get it  but  you can go hit him  on Twitter  hit him on Twitter  that's true  now  what can you say  in 140 characters  do it in 10  but do 10 tweets  that's 1400  there you go  and then it'll be noticed  and it'll get to his attention  if you go bang bang bang  you got enough followers  they'll retweet it to him  yeah but I don't want them  saying she's a conger  I really feel bad  no but just they'll retweet you  they'll retweet what you write  that this great  great  fucking  he's an ambassador  a cultural ambassador  and he's got that lady  yelling at him  and he has to stand there  and be chewed out 
[01:53:30]  for talking about  what made  look  people didn't care  about his karate movies  they wanted to see him  play basketball  and now he's  a celebrity  because of it  yeah  unbelievable  yeah  this is  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2012  so far  so far  um  so far  yes  worst of 2012  so far  Opie and Anthony  radio program  my name is Iraq  I am hosting this thing  and there's nothing  you can do about that 
[01:54:00]  still to come  Nicholas Cage  Ice-T  Rich Voss  he's not our guest  he's just singing  for some reason  Uncle Paul  uh  we check out  Sam's television  which he lost a bet  and he wound up  losing the TV  and more  but for now  right now  in this segment  I said now twice  forgive me  I just labeled it  Opie is disgusting  he reveals to us  that he cleans  piss off the toilet  or maybe the floor  with his socks  and then walks around  with those same socks 
[01:54:30]  sits on his couch  goes to sleep  wearing them  everyone here  is just horrified  by it  here it is  Opie  and his piss socks  this is O&A's  worst of 2012  so far  on the Opie and Anthony channel  oh god  when I read that  I'm just like  what  read it  I told you in person  well  reading it  is a different thing  because then you see  other people's reactions  wait what  you were howling  you were laughing  so far  after yesterday's show 
[01:55:00]  after the Donald  Sutherland interview  we were all feeling  good and all  and I got in the  elevator by myself  I lost you guys  and I decided  wow man  that went so well  and then I decided  to go for a pick  oh boy  a deep pick  I was in the elevator  it's a long ride  down in the lobby  decided to go for  a nice pick  yeah  thinking about  the Donald  Sutherland interview  does that give you  physical pleasure  is that how you  reward yourself 
[01:55:30]  for a good interview  with a good nose picking  you dig in your nose  after a successful interview  I'm just trying to  rip up the story  no I do not do that  actually  I found my finger  in my nose  let's just put it that way  and then all of a sudden  I feel the elevator  was it just in the  beginning of the nose  oh no I was digging man  you were way up there  oh yeah yeah  there was some  coverage in there  I had to remove  and all of a sudden  I feel the elevator  kind of  kind of slowing down  which should have been  a clue that  it's stopping on  another floor  and I'm in the elevator 
[01:56:00]  by myself  doors open  I swear to you  I'm fucking deep  in my right nostril  and the doors open  and probably the hottest  girl that works in this  building is waiting  to get on the elevator  I wrote in my tweet  a supermodel  she was pretty much  she was close to a supermodel  I thought it was Fez  see I'm kidding  no  and she stares at me  in complete  great and utter  disgust  I was mortified  of course  she gets on the elevator  then I'm thinking  do I go for a joke 
[01:56:30]  do I try to fucking  get myself out of this shit  there's no joking  your way out of that  no why  because she immediately  turned around  didn't want anything  to do with me  and my fucking nose picking  and just stared  at the elevator door  about a foot away  from the door  should have wiped it  on her back  yeah  yeesh  and then it was  the longest ride  down in the fucking  lobby  yeah  oh it was horrendous  I felt like a  fucking idiot  what an idiot 
[01:57:00]  I'm a fucking idiot  you want to put a burger  in my mouth  yeah  I'm an idiot  do you want to eat mine  but yeah  that happened yesterday  yeah  that was a real moment  that's humiliating  I have to  humiliating  absolutely  I have to address  another tweet  of yours  what did I do  what did I do  you have to be honest  do you do this  what happened  you said  retweet  if you also  oh yeah yeah yeah  go ahead  if you also 
[01:57:30]  I did well with that tweet  clean the piss  off of the toilet seat  with your socked foot  yeah  no  I don't  yeah  now please elaborate  on this  because  no one I know  does this  you're lying  no  you're lying  this was something  I'm not talking  that you presented  like oh everyone  does this  and I was like  I know no one  I wanted to know  and a lot of people  said hell fucking  no fucking way  dude I'm not talking  if you just spray 
[01:58:00]  the entire scene  and it's a complete mess  because I don't know  what the fuck happens  you know  a little  a little  couple drops  yeah  there's toilet paper  right there  I don't feel like  bending down  I got  I got herniated discs  I use toilet paper  never my sock  sometimes I'll reach up  but then you're walking  around with piss foot  no because it's not  like soaked  it doesn't matter  even a little trace  it's a couple drops  so I'll lift up my foot  and just do a quick  little uh  never  wipe  never  not every fucking time  no never actually 
[01:58:30]  never  not every time  but you're walking  on like your floors  and your rug  or something  I guarantee  if I took off my sock  you wouldn't even know  I did it  I'm not sopping up  like gallons of piss  it's a couple  little drops  that hit the seat  or something  do you hit the floor  when you piss  like do you look  in front  like I always look  in front of the seat  I guess I spray  and there's always  something on the floor  oh god no  what's going on  I always hit the floor too  why  I don't know  that's why you gotta  just lay it  right in the toilet  like a pipe 
[01:59:00]  yeah mine's big enough  yes of course it is  I'm being called  a fucking animal  what is called  a deep poo  a fucking animal  I'm being called  a fucking animal now  when I read that  I'm like  I don't know  one person  I knew you  that does that  I knew you didn't do it  cause you're really  strange with fucking  bodily fluids  I do  I do use  sometimes it's quick and easy  I do use toilet paper  what if it's not a fresh sock  what if it's a sock  you've been hanging with  all day anyway  your chick has to  fucking do the laundry  she's gotta pick up  a piss sock  well that's point opie then 
[01:59:30]  that's  that makes me want to do it  thank you  you want to go to the phones  alright  I got my people  you got your people  I got my people  my people are different  than your people  this guy says he uses  the knee of his jeans  oh god damn no  I'm telling you  come on  logically the toilet paper's there  but sometimes  you're already up high  so you just take your foot  and you don't want to  leave anything on the seat  for anybody else  up high  it's right there  it's barely  it's probably 
[02:00:00]  right even with your hand  and then you gotta bend down  maybe a foot  I got lower back problems  at times bro  too much  too much sometimes  I do what my sock  and my barefoot  this guy's saying  oh god  do you want these guys  or do you want me  just to read what they're saying  oh my dear sweet lord  here's a guy totally  oh my chick caught me  sock wiping the toilet  rim just the other day  and shit a brick  this is the first time  you're hearing of this  by the way  first time  and I swear to you  first time I've ever  heard of this  ever  they're calling me archaic  it's never occurred to me 
[02:00:30]  archaic  I've done everything  with piss you can do  right  literally everything  frozen it  Scott in Quagertown  wait  Jimmy lets girls shit  on his chest  allegedly  I don't know  and is afraid  of a little piss  on his sock  that's the beauty  of me  all right good  hence the irony  of my life  we got all the info  I would just think  that's the first time  you heard of that  and what if you do it  more than once  in a day  then it's  no no  then you're getting  a lot of piss  on the sock  I'm not  no I'm not  no  no  every once in a while 
[02:01:00]  is what I'm saying  and that's for real  I've never heard of it  and yes sometimes  I will use the toilet paper  but sometimes  I'm just up there  there's a little  drop or two  and I go  yeah  if I can just  take my sock foot  and just fuck  usually my right  by the way  if you need to know  sometimes if I notice  that's why all my  socks  have a hole  in them  yeah  if I notice the seat  because  the seat goes up  so the rim  not even the seat  if I notice the rim  is getting a little  you know  dirty  like dried up 
[02:01:30]  little blotches  there  and whatnot  well if you don't  use your foot  and you don't wipe it off  sometimes you come back  and take another piss  and the rim itself  but that's more disgusting  that you don't wipe it off  at all  no no it's not  because then you  I've never had dried piss  on my home seat  you kind of spray a little bit  on it to loosen it up  and then you take the toilet paper  and wipe it off  using it like an ammonia  kind of cleaner  I use toilet paper  to wipe it off  look they're across the board  but I do have  I use the knee of my jeans  we said that  knee of the jeans  I use my sock 
[02:02:00]  if I do it on the floor  what  I do it with my sock  and my bare foot  Opie's the man  yeah  I am the man  this is craziness  thank you friend DC  that is fucking disgusting  I do it all the time  so far  one out of ten  is saying  it's disgusting  and then I got nine guys  that are saying  they do it too  yeah  I'm not talking like  you don't have to be  I don't even  you don't have to talk  any more than a couple of drops  I just think it's  the nose thing  that's bad  put a little 
[02:02:30]  sock foot on the toilet seat  every once in a while  stop doing gross things  with your extremities  it's not going to hurt anybody  take better care  of your toes and fingers  snot on the fingers  piss on the feet  exactly  I use shimp  I use boxers and socks  oh my god  you gotta hear from these people  let's go to Mike in Hoboken  I'm just amazed  you've never heard of this before  never  never even a fucking glimmer  that that might be going on  you never even thought about it  never thought about it  for a second  wow that's weird I think 
[02:03:00]  it's probably weird  I do it  but it's weird  that you've never even  heard of this before  never  I don't know anybody  that's done this  yellow  Mike  yes  I'm with Opie  now we're not talking  huge puddles of piss  on the seat  we're talking little  tiny droplets  and if my back hurts  I just dip my knee  under the seat  and swipe it clean  fellas  yes  god  I don't know  that's where you lose me  I don't think  no I know  I wouldn't use my jeans  you wear dirty sweats 
[02:03:30]  who are you kidding  no I do smell the seat  of my fucking jeans  to see if I can get  another day out of them  oh my god  that was going to be  the next tweet by the way  of my new  do they really stink  what  the jeans will smell  if you wear them  a few days in a row  and I do a lot  of walking around  I'm sitting in the seat  for five hours  sure it could stink  you're in dirty cabs  of course  how many days  do you wear your jeans  I'll wear them  four days in a row  it will never smell  the acid in my jeans  never stinks  one day  you're a one day  one day  what's wrong with you  and it goes in the 
[02:04:00]  fucking laundry  why  because  you could easily  get two days  but why  if I don't have to  true  like I could put it in  now why  because the second day  my jeans feel a lot better  they feel a little stiff  the first day  they loosen up  a little bit  and they just  feel better  no  I just  I don't know  one day  I take them off  one day  I think that's weird  no because  I can  because like  you know  Ange comes over

[02:14:30]  now  when  you  used  to  grab  something  to  read  though  and  you  to  the  toilet  of  course  sometimes  it  was  a  tampon  box  because  you  got  to  read  when  you  dump  it  it's  just  some  kind  of  pavlovian  thing  that you  need  to do  to get  the  shit  moving  and  I  would  just  grab  anything  and  sometimes  it  was  a  tampon  box  and  I  would  be  like  oh  look at  that  the  applicator  now  use  that  and  the  toxic  shock  fucking  warning  and  everything  now  though  you  go  in  and

[02:17:00]  to  anything  that comes  out of  the human  body  and  my  own  also  um  what's  the worst  one for  you  the worst  one  the one  that gives  me the  most  heebie  jeebies  believe it  on your  own  body  yeah  yeah  because  other shit  will always  drive you  annoys me  the most  also  is snot  i  have such  an aversion  to mucus  and boogers  and any  snotty thing  when i blow my  nose it's a  fucking procedure  that i have to be  in front of a  mirror when i do 
[02:17:30]  it and make  sure every bit  i take the  tissue when i'm  done blowing  my nose  and and  and wad it up  and put it in  there and twist  it around and  make sure  everything's got  to be out  of there  why is it  and i can't  look at it  i pull it out  i feel one  coming out  and i'm like  i won't look  i'll kind of  look in the  mirror so it's  at a distance  make sure i  have it  and i'll  quickly fold  the tissue  over and  crumble it  and put it  in the garbage  i can't  look it's  not it  makes me  it's disgusting  you're missing  the little  joys in life  you know that  no that ain't  a joy  sometimes you  look at that  fucking toilet 
[02:18:00]  paper that  tissue and  you get very  impressed by  what what  what you're  capable of  doing i  cannot deal  with snot  do you  eat a booger  and get a  on the top  of your teeth  don't  he knows  i have  you gotta  stop this  sometimes i have to  floss my teeth  after eight boogers  i can't even  imagine eating one  i've got them on  the top of the  teeth never in  between them but  literally although  they'll stick to your  teeth i've got a  booger  sometimes they'll  stick to the  teeth and then  you gotta take  your nail and  you gotta kind of  scrape your own  booger off your 
[02:18:30]  front teeth  no what what  what are you  doing i don't  want to listen  i'm gonna  you're ear  muffing  you're ear  muffing  that is so  disgusting uh  i i know  snot to me is  i'm completely  um disgusted by  it uh and then  i guess in second  place uh coming in  a close second  would be shit  um shit second  to snot  yeah because you  don't really have  to shit is  disgusting i  just assumed that  would be everyone's  number one no  because you're not 
[02:19:00]  handling shit you're  not really seeing  other people's  shit you're not  you know other  people will pick  their nose or  blow their nose and  show you the  fucking thing i  don't see other  people's shit  really unless you  walk in a stall  and it's there and  that's disgusting  you ever have a  finger pop through  the toilet paper  during what wiping  yeah uh no no  probably years ago  when i was a kid  maybe but now i  make sure i i  wad the paper up in  a certain fashion  where uh there's  no accidents can  happen really no  accidents can happen  what's this about  jimmy i just  don't want shit on  my finger what a

[02:20:00]  and then what four  is pee and then  four would be piss  and then five would  be your cum i don't  have a great aversion  to piss believe it or  not i just think it's  odd to put it on your  sock and then walk  around your house with  it because of the  smell alone i would  think now i know  you're saying it's  just a drop or two  and it's it doesn't  affect anything yeah  but in my own mind  i would love to pump  this up and say i'm  soaking up like a lot  of urine with my sock  but that's not the  case here sir well in  my own mind i just  can't get past the  point of it being on  the bottom of my sock  and then walking 
[02:20:30]  around the house or  or getting up on the  couch and your foot  being on the couch  where you at with  earwax earwax is  fucking disgusting do  you check it out after  you wipe your ears uh  yeah yeah i i make  sure you know i know  but i mean do you  look at the q-tip and  go wow or wow look at  no no no i got  today again i will  just you never go  look what i got today  i'll look to make sure  i got some these are  the joys of life when  it's clean but i'll  throw it away pretty  quickly i won't ponder  it you won't yeah and  go wow yeah and by

[02:28:00]  of movies i'm not going to list them  all uh just go to imdb and you can  see but he's in studio he's been  up i think he was up all night he  went to an opera that was like six  hours long the guy's insane uh but  we had a good time he was really  cool and here it is this is opie  anthony's worst of 2012 so far  nicholas cage how are you how you  doing man take a seat make yourself  at home there you go talking about  the grammys yeah we were just kind of  yapping about any of it so yeah i'm 
[02:28:30]  the last guy to ask no just say you're  a great guy uh likes music though  right sure yeah rock right you're a  kind of a rock guy pretty eclectic  yeah we're actually gone so pull the  mic up a little bit we're on right now  yeah we just do that we just like pop  right on nice to know yeah yeah what do  you know what do you mean by eclectic  what do you like what i mean i like a  little bit of everything actually jazz  predominantly classical uh but i love  uh 50s 60s 70s rock yeah the stuff you 
[02:29:00]  heard on the radio a million times or  no no i i tend to uh i'll look around  i'll go into itunes and find things and  then they have that beautiful thing  called genius and then they give me  recommendations right right i just  found a band called kasabian which i  like out of england and then also i'm a  big fan of um filter they really did  some amazing stuff absolutely you keep 
[02:29:30]  tabs on still what's going on in music  these days or you kind of fall off a  little bit you know i went to the met  just the other day and i sat through six  hours of uh got to damarung  partner opera by myself and it was  interesting because i'm walking through  the lobby and this woman looks at me and  goes well what's a hollywood thing like  you doing at the met and i went wow  that's not very nice yeah is that  supposed to be a compliment no i said  can't can an actor uh enjoy a bit of 
[02:30:00]  opera and she's like well you're the  only one and i said well i'm the first  there's a first time for everything and  then she said well you must be from  europe what the hell is wow this is  sort of like uh you're segregating me  from hollywood well i guess the uh you  know the the perception is that uh you  know you're much too hollywood people  much too shallow to enjoy something  like that yes yeah i can't do opera  you can't do it you have to you can't  do i understand i'll go classical i'll 
[02:30:30]  do a few different genres but opera is  rough for me you have to really hang it  with it until it once you got to spend  like a couple hours with it and then you  get into it but i understand it is hard  to to get i went i went once and uh they  actually have like the subtitles in  front of you on the seat if you need to  understand the story it's like yeah  because i don't know italian it's no you  know it really helps because then you  can understand the show yeah and that's  what helps you get into it okay yeah  because i don't know what the heck's  going on man it seems like one long 
[02:31:00]  drawn-out song with a viking hat it's  yeah but if you look at it carefully i  mean it's amazing how much has been  influenced by it like john williams right  uh... okay and uh... it the lord of the  rings all of it comes out of those  vagner operas yeah it's the source so if  you go into it knowing that you know  you're going into like the cell  you know the route it is when you watch  it especially at the met they put on  amazing shows there the stage sets are 
[02:31:30]  us that that thing that's on the stage  which is like a series of miniature monoliths  for yes i'll see if i had twenty five  million dollars amazing they had to  spend another sixteen million because  it was too heavy for the stage to  reinforce the stage as i guess opera  really doing this well yeah yeah  right now the record is a yeah  and things are on elevators and they're  going up and down and moving it's  astounding what's going on and i really  was extraordinary but yeah no that's  what i mean by eclectic i and i and i do 
[02:32:00]  like rock music very much so rocks gone  away  yeah it's hard to find any good new  right  well you too just is is enormously  confident always you know yeah yeah  i've always loved uh oh yeah that's  for sure stay uh really quick about  opera when do you know when you've seen  a bad opera  uh when when you're just completely  bored out of your mind yeah yeah it's  just sitting there don't care about yeah  yeah the show but i i i love the the 
[02:32:30]  orchestral music as well so i'm very  familiar with it so i it's very hard for  me to be bored with the wagner opera  fair enough  uh it is it is interesting how music  like that uh especially when you want  to show that and it builds could just  give you goosebumps like that i was  crying  really by myself i'm probably the only  guy that listens to opera and actually  starts crying  but when siegfried dies he's the most tragic  character in the history of anything  spoiler you know and they and then and  then the the effects where his blood goes  into the water and it's all on the stage 
[02:33:00]  and then the music i know it so it's i got  very emotional but uh which i was trying to  quickly like like dry my eyes so no one  could see me crying  was the stuffy old broad giving you crap  about that too  a hollywood man like you weeping at an  opera  yeah all by myself and from there i went  on saturday night live  right right  maybe it was tears of fear that i had to  go live in in like twenty minutes  what an interesting evening you had 
[02:33:30]  that's a great night  i don't know who goes from six hours  uh... vodner right into snl but you  actually have to sit there for six hours  six hours  wow  wow  yeah i found it uh... empowering it was  it was a it was an amazing experience  as long as i've sat for anything maybe  three  imagine having to  you know  yeah  had snl tree  great  yeah  great  yeah  they've done some uh... they've done  some parodies of you on that on that  show before hilarious you know  oh yeah  yeah  you've been parodied a lot uh... 
[02:34:00]  by people and stuff how do you feel  about that do you like it  i have to go with the adage that any  form of imitation is flattery  yeah  otherwise i'm i'm i'm going to be in  hell  so i'm gonna go with that  everybody uh... that does an imitation of you always does the over the top right nick cage kind of uh... character that you've portrayed in a few movies um... i find him very very funny and kind of you know  well the thing is that samberg has made it his own he has a very abstract impression of me  right 
[02:34:30]  just let him do it you know it's it's not exactly me but it's it's wonderful in its own right so  yeah  yeah sometimes it doesn't have to be an accurate portrayal but there's a piece of it that is  he is kind of accurate and it it it it makes the whole thing work  i think so  yeah  yeah  so uh...  a new movie  ghost rider spirit of vengeance  yeah spirit of vengeance  uh... now that  you're you've been a part of a couple of uh... like franchises  haven't you  uh... this is the second one the other one is uh... national treasure 
[02:35:00]  national treasure which uh... all of them do very well man  they're cool movies i like that whole uh... puzzle kind of a thing  yeah uh and uh yeah but what i like about spirit of vengeance is just how pop art the movie is  it really does feel like you're reading a comic book yeah there's a there's a uh a quality to it  that it's just a little bit abstract a little bit artificial and then real but it mixes it all up  and and it's pretty gutsy for a studio to make a movie that's this psychedelic yeah it is cool 
[02:35:30]  you're doing something with a comic book uh a character because you can kind of go off a  reality and people won't go like oh yeah that can't happen it's like hey it's a comic book yeah  exactly look my face is on fire right you know and that provides a context where i can go as abstract  as i want go as outside the box as i want when i'm acting if i want to get really big it's fine  because look my head's on fire and people say well i don't understand the ghost rider exactly you're 
[02:36:00]  not supposed to understand that he's a bad dream do you understand your bad dreams you know um yeah  do you ride i do ride and i love riding motorcycles to me are the most uh uh symbiotic relationship you  can have with a machine when you get on a bike you are one with it and the yamaha who i do not have a  contract with i am not a sponsor i think is the best motorcycle in the world because i can go 140 miles 
[02:36:30]  an hour and do it safely and tell it to stop and it will stop safely 140 miles an hour yeah i'm more  a car guy like i like fast cars because i think there's this false perception that you're a little  safer with that metal around you than you are on a bike but i don't think that's that's entirely true  this is just something about a bike that scares the crap out of me well you you are safer with all  that metal around you oh okay and of course you're going fast but the formula one guys know that the 
[02:37:00]  the racing motorcyclists they're they're it they're yeah they're really the superstars of racing it is  ballsy man when you watch those guys lay it down and put their knee dragging pavement like that i love  that and the guy that i was working with in ghost rider rick english i have to give him some props  because he uh the man is an acrobat on a motorcycle he's doing front endo wheelies spinning circles and  back it's just mystical how he does it i don't know how do you start to do that yeah i never understood 
[02:37:30]  that yeah when you see this crazy trick you go okay how did you start and how do you do that for the  first time right and even skaters too how do they go up the ramp and then do a flip in the air and land  right now not break their neck yeah you know it didn't you know it didn't work out well the first  time yeah and eventually you got to go okay i'm going to try this officially for the first time yeah  and it's going to go either way right yeah that's balls it sure is yeah are you a car guy also you like 
[02:38:00]  um i used to be i i used to be um during the gun in 60 seconds once you get into motorcycles it's very  hard to go back to cars because it nothing really compares to that feeling plus you can you can beat the  traffic don't you know find it annoying when you see the guy on the bike he's just going right down  the highway and everyone else is i always fear for their lives that somebody is going to open a car  door yeah is either going to change lanes or try to you know move in there nothing but respect for  those guys they're never in traffic i don't have to worry about traffic i drive in a i drive in that 
[02:38:30]  monster you know escalade and people don't see me uh they're not seeing motorcycles is is just  yeah yeah it's a comfortable car i just like the size of something so when i'm driving i you know  especially in new york city you got it's a battle with the calves and everything it's very difficult  to drive in this city i drive a dodge ram truck oh okay and what's amazing about that car  is it's really uh great for the environment because it's a diesel engine oh okay and and actually 
[02:39:00]  some of these uh hybrid cars with electric batteries are not so good with the environment  because you have to rebuild the battery eventually is going to die out then you have to make another  one which is not great for the environment yeah batteries are very toxic and very hard to kind of  get rid of they cost a lot of money and use energy when you try to actually recycle them so a diesel truck  is actually probably better in my opinion are you much of an environmentalist and stuff do you uh i care  yeah i do care i don't want to see the you know the tigers go extinct or the rhino the black rhino is now 
[02:39:30]  extinct i mean it's crazy i don't like that either but is it really like car exhaust that's doing that  or is it people just chopping down there's that and there's also cause deforestation and stuff like  that yeah yeah i i like that stuff but i'm i'm also from the school of thought that uh we're kind of on  this planet and uh you know just like everything else we have a cause and effect and and uh you know 
[02:40:00]  for our creature comforts it's gonna cost something well that's that's true but you can do it in a way  that's prudent yeah you know just be a little bit somewhere in between would be considerate  well i understand uh believe me i'm not just rhino was beautiful yeah why don't you want that around  it's gone it's gone now scientists will bring it back when your kid says daddy i love the black  rhino i love rhinoceros i'd like to go see one you say it doesn't exist anymore but it did just three  years ago oh man yeah we lost it three years ago no we lost it i think this year it was we couldn't 
[02:40:30]  say the remaining few it was declared officially extinct this year wow you think scientists will  be able to bring that stuff back eventually probably but i i don't that's that's another  slippery slope you know and all that i don't know what that would lead to in terms of diseases  and things they have like they're now breeding fish tomato hybrids because there's something in  the fish that preserves the tomato so they're mixing the two what what can that cause oh that  doesn't sound good at all sound tasty and there are people that believe that they were there there 
[02:41:00]  and i don't know this i mean i don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist but but there are people  that do believe they're they're actually clone humans in full living it's i would assume i would  i would assume scientists all over the world that have been working on this somebody's gonna you  know not be as ethical as as the rest or what are their rights that's where what could shakespeare do  with that right and the donor what do they yeah does he have any say over his clone does the clone 
[02:41:30]  have any say over his life yeah his life and how do you and how do you turn it into an opera  yeah exactly that's next nick just sitting there crying over some poor clone yeah a clone happen  you never know man yeah i have rights i'm not just a clone that would be uh very odd to think that  you could clone your own being perhaps without a mind yeah and and just harvest uh various organs that 
[02:42:00]  you need yeah well i think all this cloning where the talk is because just the other night on snl  sandberg said i was his clone so that whole thing started and got me thinking again about cloning i  didn't see your uh your appearance it was a surprise on us yeah yeah they like to keep it a surprise but  yeah they come out and everybody goes whoo i love that yo yeah it's you i want to see ghost rider man i can't wait 
[02:42:30]  it's fun yeah in theaters friday nick that's right it's in theaters on friday yes spirit of vengeance  and who's in this with you by the way the magnificent idris elba yes who's got this wonderful larger than  life presence yeah uh johnny whitworth this this guy is full of surprises there's nobody else quite like  him karen heinz plays satan who you might have seen in the rome series and the other number of wonderful  uh british productions great actor violante uh placido uh is the the lady in the movie effortless 
[02:43:00]  charming actress i mean great cast and what's the gist of uh this uh i'm i'm working with the church  this time believe it or not i have to go and find the devil's son and bring him to a monastery in  turkey and have him exercised and that idea actually came to me because when i was promoting  the first movie i was in england and i was dressed as ghostwriter i used to like to wear the leather  jacket the leather pants and the biker boots and on my lunch break on a lark i went to westminster 
[02:43:30]  abbey not knowing that i was walking into an environmental summit between the archbishop  of canterbury and the pope of the greek orthodox church that's kind of i was sitting in the back  and then a bishop from colorado looked at me and went oh i didn't know it was you if i had known  it was you i would have invited you to sit with me let me introduce you so there i was shaking hands  with the archbishop of canterbury and the pope of the greek orthodox church dressed like ghostwriter  and then the bishop from colorado leans over and he whispers in my ear oh and by the way 
[02:44:00]  i can be naughty too whoa what does that mean i was like okay what do i do with that i've got it  let's have ghostwriter working with the church wow inspired like that in in a second and then  that's how spirit of vengeance happened wow you you got some experiences i've had some experiences  i like that i'm lucky yeah right yeah that's uh you always been adventurous i try to be i mean i i see  life is a gift and that to just sit there on the couch and watch tv is probably the biggest sin 
[02:44:30]  and that you're watching your movies yeah well that i don't do but but you need to you need to take  this time this gift of time that we have and do something with it and experience it just stop  playing around doing nothing yeah i like doing stuff i just i could do it tomorrow well no i'm kidding  of course tomorrow comes very quickly i know and many tomorrows stack up very quickly it's starting to go by  way too fast you said something there you don't watch your own movies no even even just once just 
[02:45:00]  watch it once and then move on and that's it yeah and if it's yeah if there is a time where you're  kind of sitting down and the tv's on and you see shut it off wow do you realize your movies are very  you can watch them many times well that's not very watchable well thank you yeah and the reasoning  is that i want to move on i don't want to dwell on the past it's kind of like what we were just  talking about okay what's next and also i don't want my family to see me i don't want my six-year-old 
[02:45:30]  to see me and be confused by that oh really try to keep it as normal as i can it's interesting  being somebody like me yeah i'd be bragging all over the place hey i just realized thanks to our  listeners uh uh that's uh stringer bell in this movie from uh the wire yeah oh yeah holy shit  yeah idris elba right idris elba yeah yeah i didn't know his uh his real name lambert makes an  appearance christopher lambert remember from uh yeah yeah yeah christopher highlander right 
[02:46:00]  highlander yeah uh the movie um uh wicker man yeah uh i liked that movie and then the end was like  holy jesus it was uh did you have any any reservations about an ending of a movie like  that like um no i think neil abute uh is famously known for having a kind of um twisted ironic sense  of humor wow and uh yeah i don't know if you saw his movie in the company of men and i knew working 
[02:46:30]  with him that we could go to some places that would really kind of push it a little bit now when you go  running around in a bear suit um you know knocking out a village of women who are blowing like viking  horns um you know it's uh somewhat absurd right and um so the the flavor of that movie was a mix of  being ridiculous and also scary the the worst thing about it was the fact that right up until the end 
[02:47:00]  there was this weird hope that you were gonna somehow get out of that bad situation  and not be horribly burned to death yeah and uh then when it happens you're just kind of like no  this is this is a bummer right it's it's probably if you see the original it's it's probably the  ultimate bummer of any movie of all time yeah the way that movie ends is profound the way you feel  and it goes on for weeks i couldn't shake it for yeah it's one of those that like it just kind of 
[02:47:30]  leaves you with this awful feeling it's uh the original it's the original yeah yeah yeah  i know yours too was like just kind of what oh god this it's a horrible way to die and well  originally when i did the wicker man i i wanted to play the cop with like a handlebar mustache and  really have one one these like macho guys who's just completely absurd but the producers wouldn't let  me do it i think people might have understood a little more like the bloggers and the youtube 
[02:48:00]  folks that we were kind of in on the joke if i didn't have the handlebar mustache but they they  said look we paid this amount for you to be in the movie you you will not be wearing a mustache  it's your mistake if they don't get it  oh god i would love to see it with a handlebar that would have been you know yeah that might  have helped me it's like the guy with the handlebar mustache come on so it's a goof also uh uh kick-ass  yeah uh i love kick-ass oh absolutely such a fun uh and edgy movie uh being a father did you have 
[02:48:30]  any reservations about uh the girl uh the young girl using that language no no because i knew that movie  was totally ironic and that it was a it was a farce in many ways um and chloe moretz is just uh  extraordinary in that film oh she was adorable and just hysterical to yeah there's something about  when somebody that uh innocent looking is saying and doing horrific things i know that becomes funny 
[02:49:00]  it becomes you laugh at it well i think i think all humor comes from surprise comes from a level of  shock on some that's why we have things like schadenfreude where people laugh when somebody  falls down um which is a kind of a perverse statement about society in itself sure but but  there it there it is it exists and i think when people see things that just are not right it makes 
[02:49:30]  them laugh i don't like the way people try to uh try to hide that and try to uh make it like we're uh  we're better than that right i think it's just a basic human nature to find humor in that uh i don't  think it means that we all want somebody to get hurt or something but there's something just inherently  funny about somebody else's misfortune well it's a coping skill probably on some level like even in  spirit of vengeance john blaze is much more sarcastic in this movie he's much edgy or he's much more 
[02:50:00]  cynical and i always thought of him as sort of like some of the cops or paramedics that i've met  who developed this incredibly dark sense of humor right to cope with the horrors that they've seen  and i mean they they say some things that you just would not believe that could come out of their  mouth oh yeah yeah you know but they do it because if they don't they can't really handle it right  yeah that's uh way to put it yeah that's quite true uh what did you have to go through as far as 
[02:50:30]  uh makeup and special effects on that to have your head this burning the the cgi is minimal in the  movie uh they dial all that in uh later like clearly it's a flaming skull yeah but in order to believe i  was the character on some level and not feel completely absurd i would uh paint my face to have like skull  makeup so i'd use black and white paint i would black out my eyes so you would see no white no  people with black contact lenses and i would i would walk on the set looking like that and i wouldn't 
[02:51:00]  say a word to anybody so it was just very uncomfortable for everybody and that made it so  it was like i didn't have to act because i could see the fear in their eyes and then it was like oxygen  to a forest fire where i just believed that was the spirit of vengeance that's something i think  people have uh learned over the years with cgi and stuff and i know uh peter jackson used it with uh  with the golem character he actually had uh i can't remember his name offhand but the actor 
[02:51:30]  uh walking around like that and i think it does help when there's something uh cgi to have yeah that  other fact some someone you could act with and it also helps the other actors yeah because it gives  them uh a chance to react honestly you know yeah um so that's what that process was like looking uh  looking forward to it when does that come out friday uh friday yeah this friday in theater spirit of  vengeance i want to ask him about the civil war thing people are saying you might be a vampire right 
[02:52:00]  right i read this and i'm like what i mean it's a long stretch of course but it's basically gone  viral i guess uh someone found a picture of an old civil war guy that looks just like nicholas cage  but i say politely that i think it's a slowed version of me oh is it i think so i've only heard  about this i gotta see the picture really fast come on oh my god it's you twisted though yeah it's  twisted yeah you look uh that's fucked up yeah um wow yeah but what's funny about that is like people 
[02:52:30]  don't want to let it go like i went on letterman and said i am not a vampire i don't drink blood  but the very fact that i said i'm not a vampire is creating some sort of viral thing like well  clearly he would say he's not a vampire so he could defend his position as a vampire only a vampire  would say he's not a vampire if i didn't know any better i would assume that was some role you did  that that's kind of creepy how much you look like him well i mean it's twisted version yes of course 
[02:53:00]  like his little makeup uh yeah he yeah he looks like he's had some type of accident  yeah i don't uh i don't see that so what is it with this guy is from the civil war is that what  they say yeah saying yeah so there's a chance that i have a relative from the south the deep south  imagine maybe you're just related to that guy i i mean that's just one of your ancestors been one  of my ancestors yeah oh man that's pretty funny though yeah they will not let it go i don't know  how you go from that to vampire but yeah yeah i like to know who was just browsing pictures of 
[02:53:30]  civil war people and went holy shit it's nick cage what's funny about that picture is the guy was  trying to sell it for actually a million dollars on ebay come on and i don't know if he what he did  with it but now it's getting all this attention maybe maybe he'll actually get it maybe he'll hit  his mark i don't know sam i'll retweet that you know you know he wants you sign him that thing  well that's pretty yeah what the hell that's a good story yeah it gives me something to talk  about right he's like he's at it he's like no he's talking about spirit of vengeance for god's sake 
[02:54:00]  are you trying to say you have enough to talk about you don't need to be discussing whether  you're whether or not you're a vampire maybe yeah it was it was it was on it was in an email i got  last night and i'm like what yeah really does this even have to be addressed yeah it's everywhere  what is it now we're living in like vampire culture right yeah twilight people are really  hot about vampires yeah vampires seem to be the thing vampires and zombies but they're like sexy 
[02:54:30]  vampires or something i don't know although dracula was kind of a sexy kind of a you know the guy but  i i i'm not the true story about about dracula uh and and or actually bram stoker's reason for  dracula would actually make a great movie because it actually emanated from rhode island  really far from here back during uh i don't know how many it was like over a hundred years ago  when there was like a very puritanical culture like around the time of the salem witch trials 
[02:55:00]  and this guy actually had to he was told that his his deceased daughter was haunting uh the family  and he was told by uh like a priest that you have to go into the tomb and open it and put a stake  through the heart and that will stop it and that story went viral in those days by whatever means  and it actually got to bram stoker and then he connected that to dracula or vlad tepez in romania  put the two together but it actually is an american invention wow i did not know that 
[02:55:30]  it would be a good movie yeah just take through my boy the church comes up with some weird things  to do every so often don't they they sure do yeah put a stake in them and uh everything will be cool  yeah that'll work opie anthony's worst of 2012 so far continues right now right now worst of 2012 so  far like the production said my name is eroc how are you hope you're enjoying this if not i don't know 
[02:56:00]  what to tell you still to come hope he does something that iced tea is just not happy with  sam loses a bet rich voss yay but right now in this segment uncle paul we're going to take a look  at uncle paul um this is three i didn't know how to put this together so we're going to do it in  three separate segments uh in here first one being uncle paul does not like it when people attack  guys who we think he's being just good-natured around children when it turns out they're really  pedophiles so uh he gets all upset especially with the sandusky trial going on he thinks that 
[02:56:30]  sandusky was falsely accused and all those kids were liars here's part one of uncle paul  opie anthony's worst of 2012 so far father who killed a man trying to sexually assault his daughter  oh yeah good for that fucking father man four-year-old daughter right there was a guest in his house i  guess now the story says trying to molest you're saying it was oh well from what i read it seemed  like he was you know completely in well whatever completely in on the station if you know what i 
[02:57:00]  mean so the father killed the guy good for him god i hope he doesn't do jail time i do texas father  has not been arrested has not been arrested and is unlikely to face charges and they're saying i don't  think it was his intent for the man to die oh really yeah he might have punched so many falls  really hits his head no i think uh when a father sees his four-year-old being molested the intent is  to kill the guy i'm sure every time i'm sure in the um police report it says well obviously he didn't 
[02:57:30]  mean to kill him and uh the man's grandfather also said his son was sorry and the killing was an  accident there you go the killing wasn't an accident off the hook good for the father good for him  he should go to jail oh jesus that's unnecessary he should have talked it over what did she say  what was her partner you don't just go beating people up they may have been in a relationship 
[02:58:00]  like romeo and julia romeo and julia maybe they were gonna elope or something you don't go beating  people up for being in love that father needs to go to jail and be punished so you're saying the  father deserves to be punished yeah he interfered with that relationship what if it wasn't a  relationship sure it was they was getting to know each other this makes it much better yeah oh how are you 
[02:58:30]  my darling she was four hello uncle paul she was four sure that's what i'm saying she's ready to  travel travel you're gonna elope like romeo and julia of course it's a beautiful love story and then  the father comes in and starts yelling oh what are you doing paul get that out of there between the 
[02:59:00]  crib bars she's going she's going she's going at it she's going at it like like a gerbil going after  a little water bottle oh come on jesus wow yeah everybody's gotta yell at you no reason for that 
[02:59:30]  why don't you just talk things over hey what are you doing do you both is everybody okay with this  sure sure tell the father to get out of here go in there and watch the tv we're making love oh god  oh my god uncle paul that uh is despicable it's not despicable and then my friend jerry's in trouble

[03:03:30]  goes in there and well case closed i love it  fuck yeah we should have more of that john in north carolina john  hey john what do you see  y'all gotta hunt out this video back in the 80s a news crew captured a guy on a phone  uh and his son's molester was extradited into an airport  oh yeah turned right around and  yeah i think most people have seen this video but it's a classic 
[03:04:00]  but the father was on a payphone making believe uh he was just kind of a guy in this  it just happened to be a guy in the area but he was the father  wearing a little hat  of the kid that was molested and they were bringing the molester through and he fucking  took care of business whatever happened that guy we always had around one shot  justifiable homicide  right the guy's head he was acquitted  yeah and he shouldn't have been my friend was a karate teacher you'd get in there and  everybody would take off our clothes and he'd go hey yeah 
[03:04:30]  hey yeah and you'd roll around doing judo judo how do you know all these people  they're friends of mine yeah he was my karate friend  hey yeah hey yeah let me show you the crane oh oh yeah sure yes sensei give sensei paul a kiss  that's not right protect the guy hey yeah this is ona's worst of 2012 so far on the opian anthony channel 
[03:05:00]  we're in uh uncle paul territory this is now the after opian anthony show program after opian anthony live  hosted by primetime sam roberts and we're discussing earlier that day the segment you just heard about  uncle paul saying some stuff that was beyond creepy it was disturbing and funny at the same time and we  felt ashamed for laughing at it or maybe we didn't i don't i don't remember but uh uncle paul calls in  to set the record straight about what he was talking about and how dare we attack him here he is 
[03:05:30]  uncle paul on after opian anthony live for the worst of 2012 so far for the opian anthony show  just in case you didn't know what you were listening to hit the bit this is ona's worst of 2012  so far on the opian anthony channel i learned that if you're going to molest a baby you need to make  sure that your penis fits through the crib bars yeah that's right uncle paul and what was just so  disturbing about uncle paul today is that he did the voice of the person yelling at him and you 
[03:06:00]  could hear someone saying paul get your dick out between the crib bars so gross i'm so happy that  having a child hasn't diminished my love for uncle paul yeah you still enjoy it that's a star i was  commenting in the back that it's like uh you know no one's gonna sit here and realistically think  that molesting a baby is a good time no it's a bad thing if you have the kind of humor where you  listen to a joke like that and you can't laugh hysterically i just don't want you in my life i  just don't need to know you i also loved that the characters started morphing into his real life when 
[03:06:30]  jim saw coco jones who i guess is like a disney channel star who's the daughter of a football player  um named mike jones and she was with her father jim thought they must be boyfriend girlfriend and he  was talking about how beautiful uh she was and how much he wanted to kiss her we looked her up on  wikipedia she's fourteen years old she is fourteen years old uh jim apologized immediately for his 
[03:07:00]  um discretions uh rich in buffalo yeah you guys just touched on something that i always think  about it that anybody's rich in buffalo i can laugh hysterically at uh uncle paul and then i stop and  think about it and go wait a minute this is like awful you know and you know what a fucking asshole this  guy is i know well but what's funny i think what makes it acceptable is that jim will if we're talking  about a child molestation story jim will morph in and out so one moment you'll have norton who's 
[03:07:30]  appalled by this person who molested a kid and then the next moment he's morphed into uncle paul who's  relating to this guy and then the next moment he's back to norton being appalled so it's like okay i got  the guy who's appalled so i don't know it's okay to laugh at this at this character and plus he takes  it out to such an extreme level i think and that's where well yeah i think i think when uncle paul  turned the corner is when he started mentioning his penis and dropping all subtleties from his act 
[03:08:00]  thank you it used to be all just implied molestation now it's just like yeah what i do is i have the  little baby touch my penis yeah i remember like a couple of years ago it was like oh sure i used to take  a carrier when you were a kid now it's like oh you used to put your little lips on my balls yeah yeah  it's like what you can't say that uncle paul hargus is on the phone i don't like the fact you are  misrepresenting me i'm not misrepresenting you uncle paul trump bottom danny over there saying i said this 
[03:08:30]  and that i didn't say none of those things you've gone on the air and you specifically mentioned baby  hands on your penis there's a nun there's a nun this is the best part about this there's a nun who's  looking into the studio right now there's three old women and one of them is a nun and we're talking  about uncle paul molesting babies yeah she's probably a big tall tale meanwhile she's spanking everybody  with a ruler nobody's checking to see if she's damping her you know what well either way it's a terrible 
[03:09:00]  thing to do why don't you shut up no one of your business why don't you shut up you make a lot of  people uncomfortable you're a little potty man and your father used to call me over and say sam's  misbehaving can you straighten them out so you're get right in there in your little hulkamaniac outfit  no uncle paul my father never punished me through molestation yeah did he say paul why don't you give  sam the world's greatest treat and then you'd be rolling around on your belly for three days sam 
[03:09:30]  you obviously don't remember when paul took you on that wrestling outing when you went to see the  big show yeah we'd only have one chair and sam would have to bounce in my lap up down up down yay the  hulkaman yay the hulkaman you can come home and reenact some of the wrestling matches that you've seen  yeah here comes king kong grady yay everybody's wrestling don't i don't like you slandering me i'll  sue you if you keep saying i had baby hands all over my penis i didn't say nothing about little soft 
[03:10:00]  cuddly baby hands on my penis company like expert i heard company like expert first of all you you  called a four-year-old a lady today i didn't say nothing about none of them little rattle shaking  hands expertly moving back and forth over my genitals i didn't say that you're putting words in 
[03:10:30]  my mouth didn't i hear something about about your penis going through crib bars i was trying to hang  something on the mobile and i had my shorts and it fell through it ain't my fault that kid saw it  i don't look a candy factory or whatever it was she thought such he said the the kid was going  for it like a hamster to a water bottle yeah paul i didn't know what to do i gotta go i'm in the  car goodbye uncle paul oh that's just disgusting this is opian anthony's worst of 2012 so far 
[03:11:00]  we're still doing uncle paul stuff here now you just heard uncle paul say some  really horrific things some of you laughed some of you were horrified some of you didn't know what  to make of it well uncle paul is still going he's really hot on this subject as we talk to author  bill mushy who put out a book about the sandusky trial and everything that was going on here and  uncle paul has to call in and chime in and say sandusky is falsely accused these children are liars 
[03:11:30]  and people don't know what they're talking about when it comes to hanging out with small children it's  disturbing it's funny you'll need a shower afterwards i can't believe i just said that  look here it is this is opian anthony's worst of 2012 so far hello mr mushy yeah i'm sorry i had the  wrong number oh jesus so um you wrote a book and it's a very very timely book um and what what is the 
[03:12:00]  title it's called game over jerry sandusky penn state in the culture of silence it's a long title  yes game over game over man so um we've all been following the trial and uh as close i guess the  defense begins today right yes it does they're supposed to rest as soon as the court starts today  now uh from what i see uh this is looking pretty bad for old jerry old jerry and now the defense is 
[03:12:30]  going to come out and try to discredit uh a lot of these witnesses that came up and said that they  were uh uh victims of jerry and his uh his lust for children uh what do you think uh about that  strategy and jerry trying to use that i don't think it's going to have any effect whatsoever well i've  covered uh probably 250 criminal trials in my life and uh in cases where there's accusations from  one person or another especially in sex abuse cases the time to do it is in cross-examination 
[03:13:00]  when the witness is testifying last week the witnesses all testified and i from my perspective  the defense did not really get into their shorts at all oh i think you're being a little uh uh yeah  you gotta get enough shorts or something yeah yeah wow uh so but don't they have the right to recall  them no not really uh there's got to be extraordinary circumstances in order to get them back in there  uh for the efficiency of the court and for a variety of other reasons but uh uh uh i you know 
[03:13:30]  normally uh every case i've ever covered me and they like go at them uh right uh in their face right  away and that just did not happen in this one in fact uh joe amandola the lawyer for sandusky  yeah stood on the courthouse steps on december 6th when they waived a preliminary hearing  and sat there and uh rambled on for for over an hour to the media uh talking about how they were  going to torture this mike mcquery the assistant coach right turno the whole nine yards yeah and 
[03:14:00]  frankly uh i watched mcquery twice on the stand and he uh he was very emphatic and the more they tried  to get at him the more emphatic he became uh yeah independent witness yeah uh i think uh it's a  double-edged sword there though because you really don't want to try to victimize the victim up there  on the stand especially when they had just gotten done talking about their horrid experience with this  gentleman and then uh the gentleman's lawyer gets up there and just starts trying to rip him apart 
[03:14:30]  uh it it looks like he's beating beating up on them uh to the jury yeah i mean that's a that's a  very slippery slope man and the bottom line is is that if you don't discredit the witnesses what do you  have yeah well you have what you have which is a guy that was in the shower with uh children uh and  very inappropriately yeah i mean uh you know uh the way that this uh thing has unfolded um it's bizarre 
[03:15:00]  in that mr sandusky has admitted uh not only in an interview with bob costas but with the new york  times that he routinely took showers with young kids yes unbelievable uh actually i want to i want to  let some of the listeners in on this uh conversation uh great book of course jerry sandusky penn state and  the culture of silence and bookstores now uh at uh amazon now actually uh you get on amazon right  of course yeah yeah bill uh how do you pronounce that last name mushy bill mushy all right uh let's go to 
[03:15:30]  i guess uh paul hargus is on uh on the phone uh hello paul hi you're on with the bill hi thank you  mr richardson for taking my call how are you good uh yeah i've been following  yeah chase and uh i think it's a whole lot to do about nothing to be honest with you i think it's a  witch hunt to go after mr sandusky mr sandusky yeah i think that this whole thing is just a witch hunt 
[03:16:00]  they're going after this guy bill have you heard anybody actually say anything like this and defend  uh sandusky uh yeah i've heard uh that sandusky made a big witch's brew and was uh trying to feed  it to all the young boys oh i mean that's ridiculous no because i i used to coach at a school and you have 
[03:16:30]  interactions with the students and everybody starts saying something but it ain't nothing but in a  sense and frolicking now you are so mr hargus you're so what you're saying is that uh you were in a  similar situation i was teaching and you know you can't start judging a bunch of books by their covers  think that you can't interact with the students after gym class if you take a shower or something  well uh you have a different set of uh uh codes in life than i do uh but uh the bottom line is 
[03:17:00]  is there's uh eight kids have testified there's another 16 there's another seven that have been  identified so uh you know uh that's going to be the decision for a jury to make as to whether or not  the kids have orchestrated a cover-up which is what's in the hall of fame numbers what was that paul  he has hall of fame numbers this guy i don't think that he did nothing wrong i think that they're 
[03:17:30]  just taking a whole bunch and making a big to do about nothing well i'm sure if you talk to the  victims uh it's not nothing there paul mr peters why did you write a book about this saying all the  it's mushy or mushy i'm sorry why'd you write a book about this like the guy did something wrong  there's no evidence well read the book and make your own decision yeah i just think that everybody's  jumping on this guy because he was more popular with the kids and that makes everybody jealous oh paul 
[03:18:00]  because if you're a good coach and they all like you everybody wants to badmouth you  oh don't get angry jesus uh bill bill uh how do you think how do you see this ending uh what do you  think uh happens to uh jerry sandusky are you asking me i don't know i think he's gonna get off  we're having it up we're having troubles with the phones this morning and it's very difficult to hang  up uh and paul i want it i want to talk to mr shepherd you don't even know his name uh so how do you see 
[03:18:30]  this ending uh with uh jerry sandusky well probably well uh the the uh jury's going to get the case  probably later this week uh yeah and basically uh there should be a uh uh there's 50 there's 52  charges against a guy uh yeah i've seen many many uh trials in my life and me too just try to talk 
[03:19:00]  over and i apologize i'm trying to hang up on it but the thing is uh not cooperating but uh i think  that the trial is going to end this week sometime uh there's a very little chance of a uh uh major  defense normally that's done on the uh on the prosecution side where they cross people so uh  you know uh do you think that the defense has a chance that they call a bunch of professional  witnesses too but if they say maybe they need to call some psychologists or something they're going 
[03:19:30]  to do that i'm saying and i have to testify about the lying that these kids are doing i'm sure you  could testify about that uh but uh the you know uh you don't know all right paul hold on let bill talk  uh what about sentencing uh what what can jerry face he can well it all depends on what they finally 
[03:20:00]  convict him out hold on bill what could it what kind of uh sentence can this guy get well uh any  conviction on any of the of the major offenses in the 52 charges would probably effectively be a life  sentence for 68 years old and uh 57 could you like uh be quiet you're being very rude paul i'm trying  to talk to you shut up if we could get shut up i'm trying to ask questions about the sandusky case 
[03:20:30]  we don't even know what you're talking about um i do and this man's being maybe we could pot him down  or something anything just to get him off the phone jesus christ i apologize bill this wasn't even  supposed to happen but he's so annoying um so he could get uh he could do some pretty hard hard  he's gonna yeah sure at his age uh you know any sentence he gets is effectively a life sentence 
[03:21:00]  right right yeah he's no kid that's for sure uh and and is this going to be a real prison or you  think it's one of these white collar places oh yeah real one uh i mean uh the pennsylvania system does  not have any uh really uh really soft prisons they're they're all uh uh medium security or above  so he would uh he would he would be in a uh secure facility do you see uh all right paul paul do you 
[03:21:30]  see do you see uh anybody else um being responsible for this uh a lot of a lot of blame has been passed  around a bunch of lying kids i think one of the things that uh that is very disconcerting about  this whole thing if the charges are true and that is that uh dating back to before 1998 a large number  of people in the penn state community had knowledge of the allegations against sandusky and almost none of 
[03:22:00]  them came forward right yeah and uh that's the most disconcerting when you put the timeline about  what these kids say how responsible how responsible legally do you think these people are going to be  that uh kept their mouths shut well not at all i don't think they should be i don't think they  could i think this whole thing's a big witch hunt christ could you find unbelievable or what i'm sorry  he really is and i gotta be honest about you no i don't know why they're doing this whole witch hunt 
[03:22:30]  you're right though they should be forced to not do this again i'm sorry jesus christ uh the um  yeah the responsibility i some of these people seem to be uh culpable i mean look at the the president  i guess of the university itself president obama they they didn't uh he didn't go as far as i think he  should have gone well um there's specific evidence that the president of the university had knowledge  of an event that occurred in 1998. uh and then uh in 2002 a second event uh became public a 98 event 
[03:23:00]  turned out to be a no investigate the investigation turned nothing up uh and then in 2002 there's another  one where this mike mcquery saw uh he's a rat it's a cover shut up it's a cover-up it's i i i really  see this as being a hundred percent uh a cover-up uh to try to protect the school's name and the  the football program well uh that word has been used repeatedly by the attorney general's office 
[03:23:30]  throughout this whole process what the army got to do with this what the general but uh it has gone  all the way up into the president's office there's two top officials under indictment right now for  perjury and false uh failing to report uh sexual abuse of children you know they're going to trial  soon uh and uh from what has turned up in this sandusky trial looks like the investigation is going 
[03:24:00]  to uh grow rather than repeat and then when you look on the other side of it uh there are going to be  civil lawsuits going on for the next 10 years probably i don't doubt it man gonna sue all these  kids right because they were telling all these lies and they're spreading this man's name through  the dirt they're probably going to sue them they're not lying then you think what you think everybody's  lying then yeah yeah yeah they all uh cooked it up and then waited years and years to go by until all 
[03:24:30]  this happened that's exactly oh stop it that's just stop it they're all telling the people you're  ridiculous uh we got bill uh mushy on on the phone he's got a great new book out jerry sandusky penn  state and the culture of silence it's in bookstores and uh on amazon right now uh this is uh people are  so fascinated by this what makes people so compelled uh to want to know all the dirty details of uh stuff 
[03:25:00]  like this i don't know they just want to know everybody's nosy they want it's really that was  an astute comment uh the uh uh uh basically this story is like one of shakespearean proportions you  guys situations where uh you know like joe paterno no one has risen to such heights to fall to such  depths so quickly yeah uh you know the uh university the pristine university never been under investigation 
[03:25:30]  by the ncaa before and now all of a sudden this uh unbelievable scandal engulfs it and it goes  back to the whole idea that it's a closed society up there in what they used to call happy valley and  and it's really uh a situation where they've tried to keep everything hidden they went all the way to  the state supreme court to keep paterno's uh uh uh salary right it's hidden you know and and they just  didn't think the outside would would you let me talk for a minute sure sure i didn't shut up can you 
[03:26:00]  shut up for like i'm trying to ask a question about joe paterno's salary and you're yelling at me i  got a bad phone connection and diet not bad enough why don't you like hang it up and then you won't  have a bad phone connection yeah because i came here to show if i hang up and we got a line i had to call  in and i'm i'm an expert in this area no you're not yeah sounds it sounds it you're being very rude  sir i'm trying to be courteous i well you're being more rude than anybody i've talked to in 
[03:26:30]  recent months that's not true and he probably talks to a lot of people just right uh no i mean you  know the game over the book uh it's a very good description of what happened up there before this  event how it went on for 15 years uh uh and now uh that it's going to trial a lot of it here we are  i'm back come on paul god man i'm sorry my phone's crapping out i'm all over the place trying to hear 
[03:27:00]  so and and the culture of silence the name of the book in itself means that there has been  uh a cover-up going on uh do you just mean penn state or is it really um all of these schools  and sports programs and uh these little almost like fraternities well it's like it's a cautionary  tale that's for sure because uh penn state is not the only university that sits out in the middle of  nowhere uh it runs itself and uh it generates a huge amount of money penn state's football program 
[03:27:30]  brings 54 million in profit in a year wow and uh it's a it's a situation where they were protecting  the brand and you can go all over the united states uh and find other places that would probably would  want to protect the brand because there are huge amounts of you know if this guy would let me talk  i would finish my answers once jesus think about the syracuse thing huh how about that whole mess up  there and whatnot what's the whole syracuse university you know even if you have a legitimate 
[03:28:00]  question he's not going to want to answer you because you keep interrupting the guy when he's  talking i got a bad connection that's a very legitimate point how they've seen what's going  on over at penn state and these kids are getting paid millions of dollars and now they're saying that  they're not true that's not true what everybody's making millions of dollars and they up at syracuse they  want to make money so they say that the guy did a whole bunch of stuff up there too i didn't think so  well uh i realize you've done a tremendous amount of research on that so uh in the 150 people we 
[03:28:30]  interviewed during the course of this wow yeah uh the uh a lot of people the uh bottom line is that uh  uh it's a tale that people should read to make sure that they understand the ramifications of not  being doing the right thing right tell the truth  well uh it sounds like a fascinating book of a story that is fascinating i mean people really are 
[03:29:00]  all over this and uh you've kind of put it together for everybody uh bill uh mushy yep mushy jerry  sandusky penn state and the culture of silence and bookstores right now and uh on amazon check  it out and also you're uh at b mushy on twitter what do you think is going to happen with this trial  how much trouble are they going to get into for for for perjury well perjury is a statute if the 
[03:29:30]  government can prove it they would file it because they filed two perjury charges in this case already  so which one of the kids are in trouble for perjury none of them are well who's in perjuring all  what's happening over there actually nobody really uh uh proved any perjury during their  testimony that i saw yeah well who's perjuring stuff  paul enough this makes great radio though well yeah certainly great with uh well you know i appreciate 
[03:30:00]  you calling michelle it's good to hear you yeah uh yeah absolutely bill uh thanks so much for for  calling in i apologize i like to listen not you i apologize for uh mr um just remember the name is  game over yes game over jerry sandusky penn state and culture silence and we'll see what happens right  oh all right uh paul and bill thank you so much bill uh good luck with the book thank you man 
[03:30:30]  all right take it easy man all right that's uh bill mushy yes paul holy shit god  he was getting so annoyed when you're just going huh yeah sure in the background he was so annoyed with  you if you just shut up and let me let me talk was it really seemed distracting it was so uncomfortable

[03:40:30]  what's the 2012 so far for the opian anthony show my name is you rock in this segment here our old  friend ice tea uh he wasn't really booked for the show we just saw him hanging out in the hallway  he was doing other interviews that day but he showed up really early he was checking his twitter  and everything and we went to the bathroom we're like there's ice tea what's ice tea doing here and  jimmy went out to talk to him brought him on the show he's promoting a brand new movie called the art  of rap if it's in a theater near you or a city near you or whatever you should definitely go and 
[03:41:00]  see it it's a really good movie and he's also at final level on twitter so reach out to him he loves  talking to people on twitter and he's a really cool guy anyway so he comes in he's promoting this  movie here and what happens when opie's trying to be cool and goes hey ice tea's here but it sounds  nothing like that or my horrible impression it's actually worse than that here it is this is opian  anthony's worst of 2012 so far if you like me you will not replay the ice cube ice tea thing just 
[03:41:30]  want to say you know what i may have to reestablish our relationship today then because some things  are simply more important you made me feel that's what i learned wait hold on just yeah all i ask is  you you make the people realize that i came back strong for that faux pas listen i came back strong  the last hour of the show you performed very strongly i didn't say anything to mickey ward you didn't say  anything you didn't say one word to him i don't think so no yes you did you brought up the brian 
[03:42:00]  gumbel thing which was different that was a little something that was a little opie spice added to the  interview but what you did do there was most who's all that talking out there huh who's all those  people talking you're that's the ball sack kid you're not invited it's a nice little fun gathering  well i can't go could you at least invite me and i'll say dandy's invited you're not invited  having fun out here see if you guys i heard somebody say adam waltz so i think i know what  they're talking about i can't wait to hear it again he's anthony that was anthony i heard anthony's 
[03:42:30]  voice these fuckers are talking about i mean i'm not even there well guess what guess who's one of  them i heard anthony's voice that proves he was in here i heard your voice you said i can't wait for  you to hear it again about me i'm not even not even there all right look i'll say something yes  since i just walked into the studio since you started the show for the first time first time  i want to hear ice cube well i'll tell you what find yourself a pair of headphones oh i can't do 
[03:43:00]  this because we're having an ice cube party i'm sure we'll listen tomorrow morning good i'm sure we  will too but before we listen tomorrow morning we'll listen this morning i've wanted to hear this  since you said it as as ice tea i gotta get shoes for a wedding come on as ice tea walked in the  studio yes opi greeted him in his inimitable opi fashion with a high and hearty rock if you have  it for us ice is outside he wants to stop him but do we have time or we have flip it ice cube 
[03:43:30]  how does it feel i know how it feels how does it feel but no one picked up on is how i made a ghetto  too i went ice cube ice cube almost like an ice cube but that makes it worse like i was going ghetto  but you put something into it like you were so confident that this was a person named ice cube  coming in oh really you're going to explain that to me like i don't know that and didn't say it's  going to explain to me what happened because i didn't realize that i gave it my all because i really 
[03:44:00]  thought that's definitely ice cube no i know it was i just said oh ice tea is making his way in here  and you go ice cube but do we really listen to each other no no that's how does it feel how does  it feel when it happens i might have to hear it one more time though one more time he's outside he  wants to stop it but do we have time or we have flip it wait wait wait wait can you pause this hold  on oh he paused it right a second after come on but can we point out over excited jimmy too yeah but 
[03:44:30]  over excited jimmy was saying the correct name yeah he was getting into that address address address  that that that that cadence i don't know if you're gonna make that hold up in this clip fair enough  ice is outside he wants to stop him but do we have time or we have flip it  ice cube i mean ice cube holy shit i'll tell you what you're so confident yeah ice cube yeah how does it  feel feels good man it doesn't feel good i've been there it feels horrible iraq do you have maybe another 
[03:45:00]  example of somebody doing something similar yeah see i know how bad it feels yes there he is  okay it's jimmy yeah i can hear his voice adam walsh how did i say hi john how are you oh my god i'm  an idiot and we had the same john how are you john john john john john john john john john john john  did the correction and just like opie did i immediately was like oh no i knew i knew it  all the time i knew i knew you were dead decapitated son why can't we focus on jimmy's uh he's a little 
[03:45:30]  excited there because he always gets excited it's not every day that i don't know we have time do we  have time ice tea outside the studio do we have that just bring him in time it's not every every day  that you have a rapper come in and you call them the name of a completely different right yeah that was  because we saw whatever i'll just go and look at my bank account i'll be fine yeah see i can't do  that i just had to go home and be humiliated and think to myself i really am never gonna make it as  a broadcaster you know you're forcing me to buy shoes for this wedding yeah what do you mean these

[03:53:30]  that's amazing there's excitable jimmy that is my massive mistake and then disappointed yeah  yeah excitable jimmy is followed by opie's blunder is followed by disgusted jimmy yeah no disappointed  was more i would say excitable jimmy uh blithering opie disappointed jimmy i love the  the big one i see that time 
[03:54:00]  this is open anthony's worst of 2012 so far worst of 2012 so far for the opie and anthony radio show  my name is iraq we're down to the last segment for today and then that's it and you'll be sad but your  life will go on and we'll be back live um sometime in the near future probably monday  anyway uh in this segment here sam tends to feel a bit sure of himself cocky if you will 
[03:54:30]  very confident overconfident maybe to a fault something came up about opie being at uh the die  hard for screening and he says man i you know i should have gone to that that would have been cool  and sam swears up and down that he was there hope says no he wasn't so we pull the tape and what  happens sam was wrong so what was on the line sam's television and now sam has to pay up after losing  this bet where i get to destroy sam's tv hope you all enjoy it opie and anthony's worst of 2012 
[03:55:00]  so sam you lost a bet yeah on friday you insisted that i went to die harder no live free or die  hard see i don't even know the name of the movie yeah everyone insisted i went oh my god i know i  didn't go well sam so definitely thought you went yeah so we bet tvs i wanted to go for the living room  tv but sam agreed to the bedroom tvs my bedroom tv versus his i felt like that was a good bet because  it's not a good bet my my bedroom tv is 52 inches yours is 12 inches that's why it's a good bet for me 
[03:55:30]  oh yeah fair enough that is a good bet for you but mine's got a built-in vcr yours doesn't have any  way to play home movies on it right built in then iraq stepped up to the plate and proved that i was  the one that uh was right i did not go to the premiere hence you lost your bedroom tv yes and  you brought it in right yeah you want me to go get it yes okay that would be like i still think he was  hoping he would lose it and and force him into getting yeah i thought that too 12 inch a 12 inch cathode 
[03:56:00]  gray fucking quasar television for your bedroom well what we learned on friday though is he's really  attached to this thing for whatever weird reason he's a weirdo what do we make break it oh it's all  set oh okay iraq he is okay iraq is very prepared to the r what hurts more sam doing it or you're not  doing it like i'm wondering okay iraq because iraq has a lot of anger built up anytime iraq can uh get 
[03:56:30]  one over on sam um yeah sam doesn't like it right but uh you know i've asked iraq a few times this  morning uh off mike i'm like are you ready to do this you're not gonna you're not all right i'll ask  him live you're ready to do this right i'm ready you're not gonna whip out oh my god he brought in  a sledgehammer oh god i'm so ready did you buy a brand new sledgehammer for this yes i did i brought  safety goggles for everybody wow there you go oh is it hold on look at stupid sam mr kumian look 
[03:57:00]  how heavy this 12 inch tv is aunt cool look down the hall look at this oh god yeah he's having a hard  time wow sledgehammers are great and here's sam entering the studio with the very heavy  12 inch that thing weighs a ton doesn't it yeah tv vcr combo quasar quasar from what year uh  probably the late 90s late 90s how handy is this during contract negotiations no shit nice 
[03:57:30]  goggles for everybody what will the um what will the phosphor do to us what what's phosphor there's  phosphor inside the i don't know what the phosphor is for i never use phosphor that's what illuminates  when it is hit with the electron beams well it's it's turned off though so we should be good  it's not plugged in it's not plugged in so we should be good there was a tape in the vcr i had  to take out what was the tape i don't know it was some old lacrosse tape that i never remember 
[03:58:00]  having but the tape was all stuck in there oh maybe it wasn't maybe you taped over it and there was a  little sex film what do you mean an old lacrosse tape it said lacrosse on the label who watches  lacrosse tapes i have no idea it's lacrosse exactly weirdo i have no idea what you worried at well  doing a little research now okay anyone know anything about what is it phosphor phosphorous let's say 
[03:58:30]  yeah cathode ray might be dangerous maybe we just don't even do it yours let's say  um how dangerous  hmm okay when when was that unplugged it was unplugged on saturday oh why does that matter  mm-hmm it does like i didn't watch television they have capacitors inside them yeah to store up  the energy uh they don't necessarily just um you know you could still get a high voltage shock 
[03:59:00]  from an unplugged television how long after it's unplugged yeah that varies jim  that varies ah let's see electronic fluorescence is unplugged saturday morning  well you should be okay i brought it in saturday afternoon we're fine we're overthinking this  danger well i like to weigh all danger my right or wrong get your goggles on jimmy 
[03:59:30]  i don't need goggles from way over here you should get it yeah what do you think glass  can't reach over there oh well thank you oh really  all right give me my goggles who's running goggles you did eric yeah you rock and a sledgehammer what a  good guy yes he is thanks z how do you open this you brought you bought did you buy the sledgehammer  yeah oh my god and bought all these brand new goggles yeah but you also gotta remember he's got  it like that he's got the cash you had some pocket money laying around yeah it's not the same as it is 
[04:00:00]  on other people so uh even though i won the bet i chose eric to break the tv because i know eric's got  some stored up venom i don't know why i'm gonna put on my safety goggles  my body rock safety goggles first safety goggles hold on safety goggles what about paul  paul what about goggles for you yay ah paul laughs at goggles  a goggles a paisano oh boy great so 
[04:00:30]  you think you're gonna be a chicken is correct wow these are the most uncomfortable goggles ever  i know what are you doing welding or something they cut in the edges are like razor blades i know  you should shave with them that's all i had at that time wow these are okay fucking mexicans  these goggles are hurting my face they really do hurt right oh you're like sharp over here suck  oh where'd you get these pointy goggles at ted's ted's goggles yes yes the goggle 
[04:01:00]  leporium i've cut out the eye hole gregory to help with vision but that defeats the purpose yes it  certainly does anthony i'm being sued i want to i want to go to that mike what mike is that yeah that  one down there no i want that one yeah the boss talking to that one hello okay move it over to paul  oh these are hurting my face yeah you gotta take a napkin i'm gonna have the glass napkin and fold  it up and put it um under the nose part they look like douchebags i'd rather look like a douchebag 
[04:01:30]  than fucking have the thing cutting me yeah well for a second you were doing both hold on oh that's  better that's better fold it nice eric just bought the sledgehammer so he could go home and play triple  h later no he wants to use it at dinner oh god help tenderize meat why why is the tv facing that  way exactly you non-fucking tv directional glass would shoot out this way that's good you want to 
[04:02:00]  shoot it at us why don't you just fucking turn the other way that's what i did that's what he's doing  huge hungry hippo see that's well okay anyway uh so you got a sledgehammer yeah that's good sister  sledgehammer well eric smashed the tv i'm giving him the honor today okay no you gotta you gotta  smash into the glass what's going on am i right or wrong is he doing it wrong wait what does he  want to do he wants to smash it facing the other way well because i don't want the glass shooting 
[04:02:30]  towards you if i turn it around put it on its back if you know if you i'll tell you what if you turn  in the glass toward you and then do like a golf shot boom right into it that'd be nice yeah and you're  not going to get as much of the why don't we just give it to somebody who could use it why don't you  just take it into the next room shut up sam take it to the next room and break it then tell us about  it okay this now these things are vacuum sealed are they so you could get an implosion kind of a  thing going on this is a bad idea i think it'll be okay though a vacuum seal i think uh oh my god

[04:03:30]  a 12 inch quasar tv in their bedroom that's true you have a dumb television there it's stupid it's very  smart it really has you have no business even having that dumb the amount of things you've that  was and there's a lot of usage left in that a lot of i mean i could watch i could use that i can use  that tv for years hey can we put the tv up on a chair no a little elevation really yeah why not  why i don't know if you need anything else laying around it's on the ground it's way too far on the  ground what for what safe on the ground because he's gonna hit it with a yeah the chairs spin yeah i think 
[04:04:00]  this is better on the ground it keeps the glass from flying even further just bend down low and you  can get the same camera angle yeah you'll be fine you just uh kind of hit it like a golf swing all  right erock don't do it if it doesn't break erock watch it sam you gotta watch it it's golf like a golf  swing like this oh man oh man yeah that was a good one now it's broken it certainly is broken wow looks 
[04:04:30]  like you stepped on it erock stepped on it though oh wow erock oh you think it could be repaired no one more  shot here goes erock don't do it oh man man there's a lot more usage of that there's a lot more  episodes to be watched what a waste see a tv come apart like that and look at all the parts they're all

[04:07:00]  how much you spend 199 199 200 was the limit and what type of tv did you get can we guess well first  what about store brand inches yeah i'm gonna guess okay it's definitely under 32 jesus christ you went to  best buy incorrect you went to radio shack incorrect yeah you went to uh two guys incorrect um you 
[04:07:30]  found a coupon didn't you no pc richards no it's a big chain store though no it's not we just named  them all you didn't you just named best buy best buy no it's a best buy you went to um like what like  a sears no close uh jc penny no come on uh walmart yes you went to walmart to get a television well they  do have a good tv i know okay super saver so you go to walmart i'll take the soup  well it gets me every time you went to walmart yes and uh you picked up a sony no all right let's 
[04:08:00]  go down a couple of notches you you got a phillips no a quasar i wish no i would have replaced a quasar  with a quasar but they didn't have one yeah did you get a symphonic no it was uh westinghouse  insignia tetley sharp vizio vizio what the fuck is vizio i don't know but dr robin vizio oh 
[04:08:30]  uh zazio did you get a zazio uh yeah i got a vizio a vizio yeah from who relatives  a vizio you hear the big fucking yes i hear some garbage going into it's not garbage it's  garbage going into garbage immerse yourself into a vizio discover the stunning brightness  yeah and flicker-free quality of vizio why did you pick the vizio cheap it was inexpensive cheap  so you got the vizio yeah at walmart yeah and what size is your television well can we guess oh i'm 
[04:09:00]  going 24 inches okay anthony i'm gonna say for a vizio at walmart 200 bucks it's gotta be a 32 32  which was honestly i'll bet okay 54 inches oh no is how big both my tvs are this is 22  32 and 22 is 54 you got a 22 inch vizio why do you do this why didn't you get the 32 because 
[04:09:30]  it was probably 10 bucks more because his ocd said that you can only spend up 200 how much would  yeah i wasn't going over 200 but how much would the 32 cost 249 oh all right 250 oh my god for 50 lousy  bucks you could have got five percent more you could have got 10 more inches yeah walmart they had  that the 32 video for 249 what's wrong with you 22 inch socks oh no it doesn't see look it's much 
[04:10:00]  bigger than the quasar was it's still sitting on the tupperware look at it looks like a monitor  i have a bigger monitor in the compound fucking uh studio as as a monitor bigger than 22 inches yes  it's like 30 fucking inch is just thrilled with the 22 inch now oh she's just went from 12 to 22  that's a that's a huge difference why didn't you get a hamster it's not even doubled and can you wall  mount it i don't know you probably could theoretically what are you because it's a bedroom tv it doesn't 
[04:10:30]  need to bring it in you're smashing it that's getting smashed no i paid 200 for it i'm not bringing  anything i will give you 200 bucks so we can smash to your new tv well it's 214 with tax fine i'll give  you 215 i'll sell it to you for 250. no 215 you bring it in we smash that and then you do the right  thing the proper thing you get a 32 inch yeah no i'll i'll let you start over i'll let you smash it  for the price of a 32 inch nope can it no that's not yeah that's an old one jimmy you're right 22 inches 
[04:11:00]  is good it's flat screen it's hd although the cable box not hd so we're not looking at hd stuff yet  right now it's just coaxial but you didn't get the vcr with this  no i got a couple vcrs though so that's okay you're gonna hook up a vcr to this well there's  a dvd vcr hooked up to it now what dvd recorder vcr sam why in case i need to transfer vhs to dvd  people start with that people start with 32 inches they start there i think there was a 17 inch and i 
[04:11:30]  said no i'll go for the 22 was just with you and you bought this uh-huh what'd she say she said how  much do you want to spend and i said i said i don't want to spend more than 200 she said okay  she's like all right cheapo yeah real chiseling but now she how big is 22 inches i don't even know  there was a 17 inch but i didn't buy it i bought the 22 how big is 22 inch though  yeah i can like double the monitor size right here that's it right yeah it looks big is that 22 inches 
[04:12:00]  no that no 22 inches bigger than this monitor that's 17 17 so a little bigger than that see  you're showing her though that this is gonna be the rest of her life skimping and chiseling tell  you just getting slightly less than she really wants or expects no according to uh michael uh walmart  has a scepter i guess it's called sept sept i don't know 32 inches for 209 dollars no vizio i didn't  see it there for 209 you could have got a 32 inch no i made the right choice 22 inches you could wall 
[04:12:30]  mount it with a thumbtack yeah it's a photo brian stone you'll put a little string on the back and  just hang it up like a picture frame oh my god this guy's saying his daughter has a 17 inch laptop  monitor well that's why i didn't get the 17 inch i got the 22 are you doing this for good radio  no you're just so frustrating you finally had the chance to do the right thing but i didn't get  the 17 inch i didn't get the cheapest one the 17 inch that's what i said get the 32 no one even  looks you you go all right where's the you see the wall of tvs like okay 32 okay here's 32 now let me 
[04:13:00]  see how big i can get here i'm always trying to get like the biggest right the biggest tv but we all  started 32 oh man that's 60 would look good but i can't afford that all right i'm gonna move back  down this way a little bit i went to the tv wall walked all the way to the right and then started  making my way and then ended all the way to the left no no the right was the cheapest  so i'm just saying how many tvs were smaller than the one you bought just 17 inch and that was  it right yeah just the second one in there might have been a 21 inch from a different brand oh some 
[04:13:30]  people are saying when you uh to go to turn the tv off do you just hold it over your head and shake  it that's an extra sketch you're thinking of poor sam is a victim that's from growing up  with seeing chiseling and skimping yeah it's terrible but i got the tv it's 22 inches it's flat  screen it's hot it's 1080p wow so is my phone oh hey um are you happy with it sam or you don't care 
[04:14:00]  i mean it's cool to see i mean it looks very big in the bedroom because i'm used to looking at 12  inch on a quasar yeah right so it looks big from what we're used to do you like the um the extended uh  ratio there the yeah that's nice to have but at the same time the picture's not as good as it should  be because they're just using the coaxial because i gotta clear off the dvr before i can replace  the cable box and how old's your cable box you don't have an hdmi out no does that have an hdmi in 
[04:14:30]  the vas visio yeah yeah it's got two hdmi ins okay so your your cable box doesn't have an hdmi it's not  an hd cable box oh my god well how long have you had it uh i brought it from the old apartment so a  couple years but oh did did you buy this just to piss off the listeners because they're calling  you brilliant no i didn't buy it they're like holy shit he's brilliant he bought the 22 inch just to  piss everyone off like the prestige i just live the the act but if you would have yeah if you would  have bought a 32 inch we all would have went all right oh that's fair enough well i'm not gonna 
[04:15:00]  have we wouldn't even thought twice we're like all right i would have went bigger but 32 inch okay  fine but i'm not gonna have a tv in the living room and the bedroom that's the same size  the bedroom tv is small living room is too small i want you because the bedroom tv should be smaller  because it's like it's just a bedroom tv no it shouldn't it should be bigger because if i had  a 32 inch in the bedroom then i would then you should have a bigger tv in the living room it is  odd that somebody who grew up kind of spoiled is not doesn't spoil yeah i don't know where this is 
[04:15:30]  it's a really weird uh thing all right that's it for the worst of 2012 so far 2012 so far 2012 so far  12 so far 12 so far 12 so far 12 so far 12 so far well so far </pre>
