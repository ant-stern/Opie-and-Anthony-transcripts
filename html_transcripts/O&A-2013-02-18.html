<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a “Worst Of” segment featuring unaired audio from their WAAF days.  This documented their “War Against WABU-TV,” a publicity stunt involving a purported hot air blimp dropping paint-filled bras (“bra bombs”) on the television station.  Jim Norton was in studio, providing sarcastic commentary on the exaggerated audio of the hosts, who recounted the event in military fatigues, encountering helicopters, and the resulting chaos.  The segment included listener calls reacting to the absurd stunt, interspersed with Van Halen music.  The hosts' self-deprecating humor was prevalent throughout.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of the "bra bomb" prank, including an accidental hit on a mailman (and possibly a milkman). This led to a count of offensive terms used in a previous segment.  A significant portion detailed a Sirius XM app malfunction causing a time warp or audio loop, creating multiple, slightly degraded versions of the show, similar to the movie *Multiplicity*.  Listener calls and emails addressed the app issue.  This was followed by a movie review of *The Adjustment Bureau*, criticizing Matt Damon's acting, and a comparison to Ben Affleck.

A lengthy, offensive bit followed, centered on a fictional NRA-themed restaurant, featuring increasingly tasteless menu item suggestions from the hosts and callers. This was followed by a segment with comedian Robert Kelly, detailing his encounters with trees in New York City that smelled like semen ("jizz trees"), involving graphic descriptions of bodily fluids and sexual acts. The hosts further discussed farts and other bodily functions.

Next, a segment with Bobby Kelly featured explicit anecdotes about his experiences in New York City peep shows before Giuliani's crackdown.  This involved graphic descriptions of sexual acts with sex workers, using extremely offensive language.  Listener calls shared similar explicit stories. A hungover Jim Jeffries then joined, resulting in a bizarre, improvised "hoka hoka" dance attempt with Justine Jolie, further escalating into discussions of various bodily odors and vulgar jokes. A dentist called in to correct Kelly's dental terminology.  The hosts concluded this section by commenting on Jeffries’s appearance and their lack of show preparation.

The broadcast continued with a highly sexually charged and vulgar conversation between the hosts, interspersed with promotional plugs for Justine Jolie's play and AdultFriendFinder. They mocked an interview with Celine Dion on Larry King Live, using offensive language, followed by a crude "Diary of an Unborn Fetus" bit. The show ended with "scary news teasers," short, comedic news reports playing on common fears.  Maury Povich was mentioned as a scheduled guest, but didn't appear in this excerpt.

Finally, a segment focused on humorous discussions of news teases and the competitive escalation of weather radar technology among news stations.  The hosts ridiculed hyperbolic claims, with callers from Orlando and other locations contributing to the discussion of increasingly absurd weather radar names (including "Viper radar" and "Doppler Infinity +1").  Absurd news teases (plague-carrying mice, concentrating sex offenders) were debated, and the hosts promoted their "Assault on the Media" contest.  The show ended with further jokes related to the news teases and media absurdity.

[00:33:00]  this is us in a van going to the ihop which was close to the tv station just to check out to see if  they were going to believe what we were doing oh is that it i believe your servicemen do they feed you  free at the ihop i mean you come in you're just on your way to battle you think a couple pancakes for  the boys i mean some good old guys like you without a catchphrase in full uniform which in  their case was with the nozzle hanging off their heads all right you ready it's time to get the uh 
[00:33:30]  oh this is not good when do you drop uh the bras from bobby  see it doesn't even work goofing on anybody else now you guys are free you have a pass yes we do  have a pass so this is brother this is the official uh deployment of operation bra bomb  i think you're in an unmarked van too yeah we said that oh yeah unmarked like there's no marking  like what other marks would there be guys on way to bra bomb 
[00:34:00]  i remember when the recruiters came to my school to get me to enlist into this war yeah it was for the  civil war okay that's funny ready and then they'll be free and running through the streets  and then we're going to get into a uh air blimp and uh 
[00:34:30]  pause this i see a little flaw here you're sure you're not going to a tie-dye festival  a little question here the vans are marked undisclosed location so you can get into a blimp 
[00:35:00]  i'm not even thinking about the logistics of this whole thing that you're pointing out i'm just  thinking of the awfulness of it but you're pointing out some very valid things here you know how hard  it is to hide a blimp in worcester and you hear opie stutter through it but just end with bro  i i there's one thing ope did there too which i love it was to explain why they were doing it like  it was kind of like coming back like uh you know to avenge our tv yes yeah he had to uh  wow spoon spoon feed the audience it's called spoon feeding yes jimmy let's say how to karen a jersey 
[00:35:30]  carrot let's go to john staten island john instead of an unmarked van you just should have had a van  with a giant douche on the side  oh my god  you know what it is you got to go on mark this way the competition doesn't know you're coming  undisclosed location so the cops won't be waiting of course that's right just back that blimp into 
[00:36:00]  the walmart with all the other blimps it's a dirigible you act like it's a vw van  a hot air blimp and uh we're gonna fly over abu and bomb them with uh bras and water balloons well  we're calling them uh bra bomb basically they're water balloons with uh bras attached to them i now  that they're on to this we're probably gonna have to get through their air defenses we'll be checking 
[00:36:30]  in in a few minutes here in the meantime we might as well play the latest from van halen  we weren't even good enough yet to just do our talk show we weren't allowed to just talk  but you have to pepper in music you're not good enough to do a talk show yet this is really early  on you're going to bomb a tv studio which is probably illegal but first let's get to oh  you eight one two yeah and don't forget the gallagher concert 12 years ago just want to say that 12 
[00:37:00]  years ago yes latest from van halen off the greatest hit cd that's coming out this song features david lee  raw  oh my god anthony's getting excited give me your beer man we're cranking up van halen in the car here  i uh well why couldn't the blimp have the same fate as the hindenburg 
[00:37:30]  a lot a lot of comments coming in uh air defenses against a blimp uh a bunch of interns on the roof with  fans uh let's go to nigel in kentucky nigel this is terrible yes yes about the aircraft you were  using to bomb uh their tv station it wasn't the enola gay it was just okay let's say hi to brandon 
[00:38:00]  brandon what's up hey boys hey i i think this needs to be the next coke logic animation  oh my god yeah it would make a good one yeah it sure would i know what part he could use too we got  um audio from us in the sky which is uh once we hit the uh the sky and the uh blimp uh you won't  believe the action how did you make the wind effect oh you wait till you hear the sound effects well it's  we had a lot to work with in the production room well this is all right we're getting there i think we 
[00:38:30]  could squeeze one more minute in and then when we get back from break it's us actually in the air  bombing the you don't use a stop right there tv station  let's go to caesar in staten island caesar yeah i'm just wondering if the uh the title of this little  war episode was called we were morons oh no there goes another bit that's starting a band of brother 
[00:39:00]  mans  uh well here we go sophie and anthony we are at our destination oh man this thing is unreal look at  this thing it's a blimp but it's it's tiny i feel like i'm there don't you i'm painting a picture  this thing's unreal look at this thing it's a blimp it's but it's tiny tiny 
[00:39:30]  blimp but tiny oh um black hawk down syndrome people are coming in with movies  oh boy a crock of shit now  saving private douche  full metal oh we're gonna need some lope wisers during the break oh  only thing that's gonna save us 
[00:40:00]  bye well uh i can't well you see in the blimp now i gotta hear more of this  i feel like i'm in the car with you sounds amazing it's tiny i'm not getting in this it's crazy it's  got one of those propane things to get us up in the air and a couple engines to get us uh moving forward  but hey is that they better have gas in it i'm not going to be drifting all over boston  did you hear that guy just beep at us  it's pretty funny actually okay we are about ready to uh start our retaliations against wabu we're 
[00:40:30]  climbing into the craft dude hold the phone for a second i got to get this uh box of bra  bombs into the craft loaded up this is the dumbest thing i've ever been part of man  say that again i'm actually a little scared and we look stupid if we die i'm in a stupid flight  suit like uh like tom cruise warren in top gun i'm gonna look like an idiot oh boy no after  no after top gun tom cruise could hold his head up high i'm not gonna look like an idiot you really  got boozed on that last line i really did i lost myself i'm not gonna do this i'm not gonna die with 
[00:41:00]  this suit on shut up i like the fact that as you're broadcasting you're like you're like here hold  this i have to load these bras and like this why not just doing the song you want to have guys with  you or pre-load it illogical you ask yeah we gotta explain it yeah like it's a movie or something  where's the guy that actually filled the balloon up for you they did just there was just a balloon  waiting for you in a field and there's also these awful you know how bad it is to do like these these  remotes you guys had perfect quality while yes we did here hold this it sounds just like it did 
[00:41:30]  10 seconds ago in the band while not even in the blimp it sounds amazing i don't never cuts out  i don't remember this i remember doing that i would try to blank it out too oh i was thinking  that yesterday i don't remember doing this i don't remember like recording it i have no idea what what's  going to happen next like i feel like i'm hearing this for the first time it's so weird it's like when  you get molested you just buried it let's go to steve you're on the op and anthony show steve 
[00:42:00]  yeah this sounds like mission unlistenable  gone i'm gonna look like an idiot well i have to explain the craft again it's a jensen as-111  it's uh like you said it's controlled by propane but it's got two briggs and stratton 10 horse engines  so we could put around the skies in it the guy al gave me this uh a crash course and i i hate you 
[00:42:30]  using the word crash but a crash car is on how to fly and you're gonna be the navigator and  bombardier this is gonna be fun actually getting in your car to drive home i would look up in the sky  because we should be getting at we should be getting over wabu within 20 25 minutes from right 
[00:43:00]  now and we will drop these bra bombs on top of wabu like it or not and they can't go for the transmitter  go for the transmitter wow like it or not that's tough talk i'm surprised you weren't dropping job  applications  this guy john from virginia general hack arthur  wait there was one light oh yeah metal jack offs 
[00:43:30]  oh boy  go for the transmitter and they can't stop us they want to censor us well they're gonna have to deal  with a little retaliation all right all right bro we should rock on with the tunes we're jumping in  the crap and god speed next time you talk to us we will be in the air  hopefully he'll be off the air  okay terrific 
[00:44:00]  you need to play terrible i'm sorry you need to play all those together  well unfortunately we got to do other things today so we  try to find your dignity i want to listen from 1996 yeah yeah 12 years ago yeah dude yeah yeah brother 
[00:44:30]  bro brother man yeah don't be a mother hugger hey fella guy fella guy when we get back  hey dude sister we got uh oh and a airborne yeah it's uncomfortable for anyone to listen to this  it's what eroc wrote and what was the rest of this what what was the rest of it not uncomfortable  right it's been it's been no the the next clip is is the reason you're listening today it is  anthony will walk out of the studio but i don't know he will hide he will he will have to leave 
[00:45:00]  dude the bottom line is this i mean we all get pushed around in life you guys weren't going to take it  you are an ass man i can't take you sitting here if i had access to a little blimp jensen was  how you bet on you i'm so glad you only takes one sense to listen to you guys if i had to taste  this i smell it i would throw up right now imagine if we really did this there would be just a janitor 
[00:45:30]  on the roof just annoyed just sweeping up bras like what what did this do yeah  gave me something to do for an hour oh we're the worst  well let's say hi to eric in new jersey eric  hey what is this uh uh pearl horrible  let's go to chris in houston uh chris what's up boy hey

[00:47:00]  it's funny instead of platoon how about buffoon um and this guy uh you should call it bridge over  river queer ram bro that was another one i got uh chris from pennsylvania boar of the world  um my favorite here is from spike w new hampshire full metal hack bit  uh i got the the longest show the yawn patrol uh how about butch and jersey butch 
[00:47:30]  it's oh and a double feature board on the fourth of july  followed by bridge over the river  mm-hmm bridge over the river why  why ah kelly's zeros  an officer and a brother man 
[00:48:00]  casualties of boar  operation shock and awful tony j from connecticut  uh well james uh g dump out if you have to north carolina this sounds like fags of our fathers  ah very good so uh you wanna you wanna set the stage here jimmy um yeah it's uh there was  apparently a tv show open ended 96 it was it was critically acclaimed it was a big fan following 
[00:48:30]  and uh they censored it i found the tapes i'll i'll bring the first uh episode in tomorrow and we'll  put it up on the fine website that is named after the show that we cannot promote promote  and it was w uh what was it abu or abu right uh they took the show off the air and they were about  to rue that decision opian anthony got a uh a blimp and we're going to drop 
[00:49:00]  paint filled bra bombs on the station bra bombs yeah that's uh what we were armed with well because  we were uh collecting bras i remember this part we were collecting bras for a while sure and we  were going to like hang the bras in protest across the uh charles river but the station thought that  would not be a good idea we would get in uh real trouble so then we had to go into sure into the land  of violations we had to go into the land of a of uh of fantasy 
[00:49:30]  and um the whole thing is this and i just found this out yeah because you hear and they're like  broadcasting from the van and then ops loading things into the blimp and ants got like they get  the military clothes and all of a sudden like we're on break and they're like you know we were in studio  the whole time like get out of here you were not in studio the whole time yeah hard to believe  you're outdoors hard to believe this um is really uncomfortable strap in it oh god i don't think  i could um well don't forget they were in full full regalia absolutely we are very regalia military 
[00:50:00]  hot air balloon as we pick up the show from 12 years ago 12 years ago 12 years ago 1996 which  which isn't that long ago we are in the air i think we're on the air bro it's open anthony we  are heading for our aerial assault we're about 600 feet off the ground over the charles river heading  out of boston heading toward our target don't look at me like that jimmy people are looking up and 
[00:50:30]  waving at us man this thing is unreal we're in a hot they're waving goodbye yeah off the boston airwaves  i don't think i don't think he goes to waving with one finger  oh and those things that were were they were the ratings  i hate the look jimmy's giving me oh it's great it's this awful like pitied look blimp sounds 
[00:51:00]  wait till you hear the helicopters jimmy oh no i love how their voice is getting louder because  they have to talk over the engines of course it's crazy yeah yeah uh and on the phone yes  hey we lost you oh come on man we're in all right uh jeff jersey what's up what's up brother  chester's liver i'm sorry from here to obscurity  uh what do you got jeff the uh next video to go viral two guys all crap 
[00:51:30]  all right let's uh man this thing is unreal we're in a hot air blimp this thing is really small  i just read what john from virginia plot tools  and we're in the  the tuskegee brother men 
[00:52:00]  this is so  this is so embarrassing  let's say hi to danny of brooklyn danny  hey what's going on the good the bad the stupid he's going back a little ways  unreal we're in a hot air blimp this thing is really small and we're on a bombing mission man  we're gonna bomb abu you gotta love that man 
[00:52:30]  oh my god they didn't well you yelled what was that it must have been a good idea  nobody recognizes  that's being logical i told you stop your bombing mission started when you wrote this bit  that's when it started this is when we used to write  what's happening 
[00:53:00]  oh  don't get crazy brother man this is so hard to listen to  i can't stop in the middle now i'm cursing i'm sorry  what's happening  well we don't know what just happened it must have been a good idea  ready yeah what was that  what the heck is that  oh my god what was that are you all right bro yeah that was a traffic copter i guess they're  doing the traffic report wait can i ask the question you you start off by going uh what the 
[00:53:30]  heck is that and then all of a sudden you guys get like whoa what is that like how did you not  recognize a helicopter that was dropping panties i don't understand how a helicopter a traffic copter  came by yeah and you like you saw it and then it moved and then all of a sudden you didn't recognize  how did you not recognize it was a helicopter i should have jimmy i i i really should have 
[00:54:00]  recognized that this was a propane pallet propeller jensen a helicopter briggs and stratton engine and  well wow i uh what is that obscure thing that flew by us i have never seen one of these before  i gotta hear the bump again can we please hear that because i let you go what the heck is that  oh my god what was that are you all right bro yeah that was a traffic copter i guess they're 
[00:54:30]  doing the traffic report because uh yeah is that what you guess they're doing  we have actually just hold on not only here he goes we're never gonna get through  not only did anthony not recognize a helicopter he almost got hurt thank god you're okay  but oh not only knew exactly what it was he knew what they were there for 
[00:55:00]  it's a traffic copter it's the uh the news is five and uh  i don't understand how you knew exactly what a helicopter  steve pike from boston red yawn yeah casualties of this bit  we are very close to the mass pike we have actually just passed over the bu bridge and i can  see the mass pike and actually traffic is really really bad today it looks like all the cars are  stopping and looking up in the air wait now now you're doing the traffic traffic report 
[00:55:30]  on the way to an attack a big mission you decide to do traffic and also they the people are waving  at them and they can see traffic is stopped and yet the helicopter five feet away from the blimp  nobody seems to know nothing what is that mysterious whirly bird is it a pterodactyl no anthony it's a  helicopter doing a traffic report sponsored by why are you doing this to me but what happened to 
[00:56:00]  traffic was stopped everybody's looking up they're probably like is this crap actually coming through  my radio but they were they were they were in full regular regular regalia you know so the helicopter  you couldn't see them opie your catchphrase should be sorry  it's like hat break ridge oh you got me laughing so hard i just drooled to myself  and looking up in the air for some reason man  give us another blast 
[00:56:30]  the red baron is strafing us apparently  hold on that's tough war talk  that's very genuine very authentic war talk  that's what clint eastwood said in all his movies  could you not listen to this i like the fact that as it's coming we hear the helicopter and then  they go whoa you scared the traffic copter was going to shoot you guys down is that what you're 
[00:57:00]  worried about yeah i thought there might be an accident never that's from munaki pilot's a bromba deer  oh man that copter was so huge dude it just blew us off course give us another shot of  me all right oh my god all right i got i got you gotta take a breath 
[00:57:30]  just drop the bras on fenway park hope he needs a standing eight count wow and like i admitted  earlier i don't mind being uncomfortable i love making other people uncomfortable my girl was trying  to understand that whole thing yesterday because she said she turned the show off yesterday when we  started playing this crap i i enjoy it but everyone's wild i i take a jab right to the forehead and uh  i'm feeling a little woozy well dude that the hell because i know what's coming next because  you know we're off course jimmy so you know we got to get back on course sure you do i mean when 
[00:58:00]  that when that when that giant helicopter blew the blimp off course i mean  of course you got to get back on course meanwhile so i could accomplish your mission right jimmy yeah  oh yeah you have to and now all of a sudden you don't know what it is but anthony recognizes  it was a trooper helicopter yes it was a state um trooper yeah uh a helicopter wow you ready  who buzzed you as well as the traffic copter everybody's so aggressive with you guys  how big was this copter that blew you off course shut up i mean the jet stream apparently

[01:19:00]  will be back live tomorrow um somewhere around 6 a.m good luck we're doing listener requests  worst ofs and uh going back to facebook here a guy named derek call that's an interesting last name  uh derek wanted to hear the time that ona were stuck in a time warp with the delay what this was  is uh we were we had so many problems with the serious xm app back in the day i think they got  most of the bugs out of it now with the on-demand service and everything but this is before on-demand  this was just when you were going to stream the show and apparently either it wasn't streaming the 
[01:19:30]  right portion of the show or maybe it was streaming ron and fez or maybe it was so far in a loop that  you just couldn't figure out what the hell was going on so we decided to pop up the app and take  a listen and heard everything that we just talked about stream right back to us over the air and then  that got streamed back to us and it was just an ongoing loop i'm gonna stop talking now it's the  worst of the open anthony show can you go back to the uh we're making progress list yes we got a new  one to add today solutions by the way i'm going with solutions solutions i don't want to be always 
[01:20:00]  uh the negative nancy so i want solutions on top of the bitchin and i we're giving out a lot of  solutions today so just a list of solutions or a list of things that are being sent upstairs  no i've heard that we're making progress on this one making progress on and it's coming in  a shitload that once again ladies and gentlemen don't say the online feeds out the online feed  is down well that's things that are being worked on it's all right i gotta say except xm amp load 
[01:20:30]  online feed for the iphone is down and only on the virus only on the virus it happens to iphone feed is  down every hey when the fuck are you guys gonna fix the online feeds should i continue this fucking  whoever does the internet for the online feed here whatever whoever does this stinks should be  at their job and should be fired yeah it is happening too much to people who are paying for the  fucking service and only our show so obviously there's some kind of agenda there or uh or they 
[01:21:00]  just really stink at what they do they must either on purpose or you stink well they tell me it's like  isolated or something i don't know how is it isolated only to this channel though i i don't get it how  does it happen that it doesn't happen as much as uh people are saying right they're just saying that  for no reason all at the same time i don't know all at the same time yeah that's great when you all  of a sudden the twitter blows up with people just going online feeds out online feeds out when you  like them to like that part of the service like as a satellite wouldn't you want that to work so 
[01:21:30]  they can enjoy the satellite radio features even when they're not in their car yes it's happening on  different phones and a guy vince who's definitely reliable vince from bayonne i know a lot of these  guys are assholes but yeah that queer is reliable vince is very reliable he says uh oh fuck it's  coming in so much i just lost his uh i could hear the feed on oh i could hear the feed on my pc  i'm checking no i know what is that station what feed is now online feed is working here okay i want  to apologize to your ipod there it is it's working okay is that from yesterday can we just say apple 
[01:22:00]  infused horse semen you just were talking about it wow how much of a delay is this the drop of a horse  cock wow wow i need to get my uh yeah i want to listen to hear how we did i want to listen to the  show horse come for this show i can't get interns i'm gonna get a horse cup can we just get a horse  come and look at it just to look this is old fuck we're funny how about you open the violence 
[01:22:30]  entertaining this is like a best of i just want horse come in a beaker today so badly i just want  a beaker filled right to the tippy top with horse come why would you say that context yes that could  be i hope we mark that oh you smell that so wait oh god your lower your lower jaw like we're making  them listen to the same yeah i'm getting like chills like like that raw animal cum smell i'll bet 
[01:23:00]  you it like the cream rises to the top too it probably separates wait a minute that's a hell of a delay  huh anthony yeah this was an hour and a half ago wouldn't this be be like looking in a mirror though  if he kept the phone up wouldn't it just continue now yeah yeah yeah then it would right it would  loop it would loop around i mean i have to do it for like 10 minutes wait what would happen it would  go back to that yeah this would be on that this would be on there and that's slightly worse quality 
[01:23:30]  each time it went around because you know analog yeah playing it yeah because then we would be  listening to the feed and then what happens after that i'm trying to figure this out in my head you  know what i'm trying to say oh if he put it there he could hold it there all day and it would just  keep going but we stopped doing a show yeah but the sound is going into the mic from that so it  would just keep going right because it's from the mic it's not like yeah the memory of uh when i talk  about the best shows we've ever done but when would it end that's what i'm trying to say 
[01:24:00]  10 o'clock how long is that delay it's pretty long why is it so long that's how it is online oh you'd  hear it over and over and over so it would become this just massive are you sure yeah but why so  long with the landline the computer now we're listening to it on the app we hold the app up to  the microphone because at some point it would kick in and he's still playing it i'm really confused 
[01:24:30]  it would just have to work this out in my head you would just keep hearing it what though what  would we be hearing if we stopped talking is what i'm saying if we stopped talking right now what  would happen to this show it and prove  it's like a row row row your boat thing see i go row row row your boat gently down the stream and then  you go row row row and i keep going row row row your boat and then he goes in and it would just keep  doing that yeah but i i would probably jump in with merrily merrily merrily merrily you would do 
[01:25:00]  a merrily merrily merrily merrily yeah really life is but a dream here go back up to the love seeing  that into a vagina good one yeah so obviously we can't do that on satellite radio right oh the delay is  so long i can't even think about it it's so disgusting  we did this 10 minutes ago  the same day that we did baby bird was the same  yeah i think we did the bowl of puked up fruit loops yeah oh man was that pushed aside 
[01:25:30]  oh yeah it doesn't work we're very conversational i like this yeah i haven't heard our show in a  long time it'd be easier for uh us to call the show and then hold it up because then delay is shorter  and we can see what would happen all right we should take a break i guess yeah oh what is this  what's this why are they giving us this wrong are we getting any one of these people are we  getting matt damon thanks are we getting uh emily blunt we got matt damon yeah how about emily to  the point blunt how about emily tells it like it is let me ask how about emily uh joint in philly 
[01:26:00]  all right i uh this is born identity i saw this already is it is it good  it thanks to joe roland yeah oh boy is it good roland fantastic yeah yeah it's what am i getting  elijah woodshot i saw it the adjustment bureau see there's some kind of weird behind the scenes  organization that keeps everyone in line almost like a matrixy thing and uh and uh matt damon uh wants to 
[01:26:30]  be with emily blunt but the the architects of this thing right say that they're not supposed to be  together and then the whole movie is them trying to be together and him trying to find out what  these people are and oh man it's action and intrigue i bet there's some kind of a very  clever message about our government in there yeah yes not of course no the thought the thought  control by people on matt damon's side of the spectrum you'll know nothing about the thought 
[01:27:00]  policing done by them no you'll have to watch it jim am i wrong maybe i hope i am actually  but i'll bet there's a message in there a message yeah movie without good did matt damon sit somebody  down and say look i want to be completely boring what do i do he's a good actor naturally i think 
[01:27:30]  he's a very good actor but yeah he's all right i i like his work i mean i think he's a little  overrated maybe but i do enjoy watching him on film but he's become so predictably agenda driven  it's annoying what happened to ben affleck where has he been the town he directed the town yeah yeah  that was you know that's yesterday's news well how long ago was the town the town was an amazing  two years i like the town i loved it now what political office rolling really how about he 
[01:28:00]  just continues making movies that's what he does yeah what are you doing what are you doing  where are we on the online online it should be fine are we now listening i'm sorry sorry are we now  listening to ourselves on the online feed yet almost all right yeah you're ready  they just really stink at what they do they must be on purpose because you guys are talking about  the feed right now so you're about to play the wow yeah i don't get it how does it happen  now we're gonna see what happens remember this i think you're just gonna hear it what are we 
[01:28:30]  gonna hear though now i don't know all at the same time yeah that's great when you all of a sudden  the twitter it blows up with people just going you remember saying that i remember saying that  barely as if it was i barely remember that's just on the edge of my short-term memory yeah  it's happening on different phones and a guy vince who's definitely reliable  vince was reliable remember saying that watch watch it moves too fast  this is very reliable he says watch uh feedback oh fuck it's coming in so much 
[01:29:00]  see i'm like kreskin damn that was good you hear the feed on my pc  uh all right you're saying that's the gay  it's cosmo the gay uh music  i want to apologize to your ipod  there it is it's working  is that from yesterday can we just listen  we can hear us and us talking 
[01:29:30]  there's a lot of voices going on  is there three versions of us now  at one time three versions one more mediocre than the other  a lot of us wait we got current  past and  right now  amazing  we have right now  we can just walk out of here and let that play might as well  they'll never know  they'll never notice the redundancy is what we do every day 
[01:30:00]  of course come for  quickly imagine sucks horse come farts repeat  how does anybody know which version is the current us anymore  so long now yeah it's now yeah yeah this is the real  isn't this the plot of multiplicity  yes  anthony yeah  oh what  yeah  no that's my old  i was talking to the old  you  that's the old  yeah yeah yeah 
[01:30:30]  you're asking again  now we're asking what would happen  but we're living through what would happen right now  it would go back to  you already said this  and then you hear us in the background also  that slightly worse quality each time it went around  how did you know that i knew that see  but how does it end  it never does it just keeps piling up on top  when it comes around again we'll hear this very thing that i'm saying right now  you hear this yeah  but the quality isn't going to be as good because listen listen 
[01:31:00]  but hi hi how you doing see the quality  it isn't what it was right first said it  fudge  all right let's listen for a second  memory of uh  when i talk about the best shows we've ever done but when would it end  that's what i'm trying to say  how long is our delay  is this now  no this is then what are we listening to  we're listening to three versions of the show  no but right now i mean what's happening now  this this is the past  yeah that's the past what's the past where is the present we're listening to it on the app we hold 
[01:31:30]  the app up but but if i say this and listen to it later this is the future at some point  but then that's the past it would kick in and he's still playing it  i'm really confused it's amazing we think we have this amazing loop and people just looking  at it like you guys stink  if we stop talking is what i'm saying  yabba dabba do  right now what would happen to this show it in true that's right pat  i remember when jimmy said that it was funny then it's funny now it's gonna be funny again 
[01:32:00]  but did he say that a long time ago or a little while ago a while ago  world no no that wasn't the long time ago it was the medium time there's two versions ago  yeah two versions ago yes by the time they hear this again then it's the older version  this is getting weird yeah  why would i sing that  i don't know  i'm eating 
[01:32:30]  wait what what are we doing now  where it's come  the same day that we did baby bird was the same  yeah we did the bowl of puta fruit loops  yeah oh man was that pushed aside  oh yeah that doesn't work we're very conversational i like this  yeah oh my god this is weird i meant when you said that  to call the show and then hold it up  i just want it to sound like like grand central station  yeah the door shut but the door didn't shut 
[01:33:00]  i know that's creepy  oh that is creepy  what's this why are they giving us how much how much longer before it goes back to the beginning  again are we getting uh okay is that what's going to happen  roland's bringing in the dvds now but he already did that i got the dvd in front of me  but i can't hear the original anymore really  well this is born identity i saw this already what what original  i had turned off the yeah thanks to joe rogan  yes is it good roland wait  because we're about to start the loop again we're thanking joe rogan for the blu-ray that 
[01:33:30]  roland brought in no no that was for baby bird  baby bird and then yeah yeah  weird behind the scenes organization  that keeps everyone in line almost like a matrixy thing i remember saying this  yep me too and uh matt damon are we getting close to the beginning again yeah we're about  to start the loop again are we all right let's listen to the loop again  no way i don't want to  supposed to be together and then we'll finally  move on trying to be together and him trying to find out what these people  because remember you talked about the movie and then you said where are you in the stream 
[01:34:00]  and i said almost there i never said that  clever someone added that in in there oh my god one of me said that  the thought the thought control by people on matt damon's side of the spectrum  remember this i do unfortunately vividly  right at least we know the online stream is working  yeah  they'll think it's working like over and over again 
[01:34:30]  they'll think there's a problem with it  just blame it on eric okay eric played uh the replay over the replay right  what do i do  i could eat and it doesn't matter now because i'm talking  it's like five minutes of content stretched out to 20.  that's what we try to do here  but i do enjoy watching him on film but he's become so  yeah predictably  agenda-driven you're right jim i don't remember jimmy saying this so this is 
[01:35:00]  i don't i miss this this is new to you yeah yeah that was you know that's yesterday's news  well how long ago was the town the town was an amazing two years  like the town i love the town you know we're talking about uh  what  really how about he just continues making movies that's what he does  yeah what are you doing oh are we coming around  where are we on the online online  i'm sorry sorry are we now listening to ourselves on the online feed yet  all right yeah you're ready  what the fuck is they just really stink at what they do 
[01:35:30]  on purpose oh god talking about the feed right now so you're about to play the wow yeah  we're about to go four levels deep wow really levels deep this is like some inception  shit we shouldn't be going this deep we shouldn't no we got to go this dangerous  that's great when you all of a sudden the twitter blows up with people just going  oh you can start hearing the quality difference i said that  that's just on the edge of my short-term memory 
[01:36:00]  oh my god  how did you know that  i just said it oh my god there's the cosmo station again  hey what is that station that you have on  which is now all right  why 
[01:36:30]  we're done talking about tracy morgan we're done what happened  okay there's the four  oh  oh  I want to listen to three versions of us now.  One more mediocre than the other.  There's a lot of us.  We got current, mask, and...  Mastic Weep calling this Deja Boo. 
[01:37:00]  We have to talk over this to add the floor.  Yeah, we do.  That's true.  I want to hear what it sounds like so far, though.  How does anybody know which version is the current us anymore?  That's what I hear in my head all day.  Yes! 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, yeah, this is the real one.  No, this is the real one.  No, now is real.  Which one's real?  Now is.  Then was.  No, that's my old son.  I was talking to the old EQ.  Oh, my gosh.  Are we going to get paid for today?  We shouldn't.  I don't think we should.  Maybe you get paid quadruple.  That's a good idea.  Yeah, man.  I got four versions of myself out there now.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  That's four days of work.  I knew that, see?  But how does it end?  Then we would be listening every time.  It just keeps piling up on top.  When it comes around again, we'll hear this very thing.  You were right!  You hear this?  Yeah.  But the quality isn't going to be as good.  Because listen, listen.  Hi, hi, how you doing?  See, the quality isn't what it was when I first said it.  Not like this quality right now, which is good.  But it's not anymore.  No, now it won't be.  Right.  This could be the most annoying thing we've ever done on the air. 
[01:38:30]  Maybe.  Ever.  All right.  Fine.  It was a curiosity.  That's weird.  It was a curiosity.  You hear how it sounded?  Thank you, Sam.  I guess the online feed's working.  Definitely.  You sure?  Oh, yeah, you're sure.  You can hear it.  This is the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.

In 2006, we begged investors to get out of the housing market before it plunged.  We were among the first to predict the recession of 2007.  We predicted the stock market crash of 2008.  And finally, we turned bullish on stocks in 2009 and rode the Dow from 6,440 to 13,437 in September of 2012, a gain of over 100%.

[01:43:00]  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony, Sirius XM.  Worst of Opie and Anthony, my name is E-Rock, E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  And we're off for President's Day, so we're doing worst of listener request time.  If you went to our Facebook and posted, like I told you to, to know clearly and precisely what you wanted to hear,  I went through and perhaps I picked it.  Let's see what we got here.  Alex Lucero, hopefully that's right.  If not, I apologize. 
[01:43:30]  He wanted to hear the old bit of Charlton Heston and the NRA-themed restaurant.  We can do that for you.  Here it is.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Dre from the city.  Did you guys watch the NRA meeting last weekend?  Charlton Heston spoke, and it was like a scene from Planet of the Apes.  He was holding a big rifle and yelling.  You know something, I am a very strong advocate to the right to bear arms.  I really am.  I'm serious.  But that Charlton Heston is an effing lunatic. 
[01:44:00]  He's out of his mind.  That guy is crazy.  Looking more and more like an ape every day, too.  Oh, yeah.  He's starting to look exactly like Dr. Zayas.  He's getting the big protruding jaw.  Dr. Zayas, help me.  Zira.  Zira, Cornelius, help me.  There.  We got him.  He looks just like him.  Damn you.  He did that famous line.  They get up my gun when they pry my cold, dead fingers from around us. 
[01:44:30]  Damn you all to hell.  And he had the rifle up in the air.  He was holding it like Moses held the staff.  Yeah.  And he's like holding it.  Damn you.  I was expecting him to fire a few rounds off into the ceiling.  Damn you all to hell.  Anti-gun people.  F off.  I'll treat you like I treated those gorillas on Planet of the Apes with my gun. 
[01:45:00]  Remember that?  I shot him all, bastards.  Then I fooled Dr. Zayas to come around the corner and I put the gun to his head.  That red monkey ass of his.  I believe it is the right of every American to have a Vulcan cannon in his car if he wants one.  Damn you.  And what's the problem?  Why? 
[01:45:30]  Why a problem with the theme restaurant in Times Square?  Oh.  We want an NRA theme restaurant along with Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock and the Sports Cafe.  Hey.  Mr. Heston, that's a little wacky.  Why damn you?  NRA theme restaurant in Times Square.  Why?  What's the difference?  It's a hobby.  A sport like everyone else.  Why can you have goddamn hippie communist clothes hanging up in the Hard Rock? 
[01:46:00]  But you can't have good old American guns in a restaurant.  That's what a restaurant needs.  Come on.  We could serve the children little, like, sundaes after they eat.  Ice cream sundaes with, like, magnum rounds decorating.  That'd be cute.  You'd take them home.  Little guns hanging up all over the place.  They're out of their mind, though.  An NRA theme restaurant.  Because we were at the All-Star Cafe. 
[01:46:30]  Yes.  And we ordered the Shaq Attack turkey sandwich.  Shaq Attack turkey sandwich.  Or whatever it was.  Why have that when you can have Ruby Ridge ribs?  Come on, damn you.  How about the Columbine cobbler salad?  Yes.  It's on the menu.  Or if you're watching the game.  Yeah.  What would be better than sitting down with some wacky Waco wings?  Hot wings!  Come on, damn you.  Mr. Heston, don't forget about the Luima lasagna. 
[01:47:00]  Yes!  That'd be great.  All the waitstaff will have guns.  So if anyone tries to walk out on the check, we shoot them!  Could you imagine that?  The Kent State College crunchy chicken fingers.  That's just a few things on the menu.  Damn you!  I'll treat you like that red-ass, mandrel monkey-ass, gorilla-ass that was trying to get me on Planet of the Apes. 
[01:47:30]  Can I say yes one more time?  Charlton Heston.  Yes.  Will you be like a hostess at the restaurant?  I'll be the hostess.  I'll be the hostess.  Yeah?  And fully armed.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  When you order a steak, you go in the back and shoot it yourself! 
[01:48:00]  Come on!  I'll give you a 30-odd six and you'll just pluck it off!  Pass that dumb cow over the head!  We'll hold his feet.  We'll head him and heel him with the rope.  You take out the 357 right between the horns!  And then, oh, it's so tender and juicy that way.  Would you like it well done or rare so it's red like Zira's monkey-ass? 
[01:48:30]  Some days I'll be dressed in a loincloth.  Oh, yuck.  Some days in a loincloth.  Some days in my outfit I had in the Omega Man.  Remember that movie?  Sure do.  What did I have in the Omega Man?  Guns and plenty of them to shoot the dead!  What happens if we're overrun with the living dead and we don't have guns to defend ourselves?  What happens if we don't have guns in this country and all of a sudden guerrillas take over?  Would you like to be like those mindless people held in cages being dissected? 
[01:49:00]  Or would you like to be like Chuck Heston when I see the Statue of Liberty and I fight back with my gun?  Damn you!  You blew it up!  Remember?  Every Chuck Heston movie you see, where I have a gun, I come out on top!  Although I died in Planet of the Apes, I died in the Omega Man.  I died in Soylent Green. 
[01:49:30]  Wait a minute.  Hold it.  That didn't work out too well.  I didn't have a gun in Ten Commandments and I lived.  I didn't have a gun in Ben Hearn.  I made it through that.  I died in the Omega Man.  Goddamn guns are screwing me up!  I die in all my gun movies!  Anthony or Mr. Heston, whoever you are right now.  Damn you.  More and more suggestions for the NRA-themed restaurant menu coming in.  Yes.  Let's not forget the Son of Sam soup and sandwich special.  Yes, that's a good one. 
[01:50:00]  The .44 caliber killer.  David from Ridgewood, New Jersey.  Columbine Calamari on the appetizers.  Columbine Calamari!  Let's not forget Watts Wings.  What about the Jack Ruby Red Wine?  Yes.  You drink that with the Cheese Harvey Oswald.  It's the burger.  Cheese Harvey Oswald!  It's a play on the name, you doffy bastard!  Well, they have a breakfast special too, Anthony.  The Lee Harvey Omelette. 
[01:50:30]  Lee Harvey Omelette.  For breakfast.  Look at the way we break the eggs.  Back and to the left.  Back and to the left!  And then a little, a little, uh, little, uh, what's her name, uh, Kennedy?  Uh, Jackie O.  Jackie O.  Tries to get the shell from the back of the, the trunk of the car and put it back on the egg.  It's so cute.  Boy, I went a long way for that dopey joke.  Bloodstained tablecloths on every table.  Uh, Moses from Egypt checking in. 
[01:51:00]  I'd like to order the 9mm chicken bullets with barbecue sauce up, please.  Yes.  All tender.  Uh, Jim, you're next.  Hey, Jim here.  Yeah, what's up, Bill?  Hello, Jim.  How about the John Wilkes Booth bacon cheeseburger?  That's a good one.  All right.  A big stack of curly fries.  It'll be good food.  Good food and firearms.  That's what we need in Times Square.  Uh, Mr. Heston, don't forget.  I'm shooting anymore.  Don't forget about the Diablo poppers. 
[01:51:30]  Get 41 per order.  Damn you.  The Sirhan Sirhanwich.  Come on.  It's a good one.  The JFK Open Face Sandwich.  What's wrong with that?  Holy cow.  Why?  Why are people so averse to guns?  Guns with your meal. 
[01:52:00]  A little happy meal for children with a little 22 Saturday night special.  Could run around and have fun shooting each other.  How about the Sirhan Slurpee?  Yes.  For dessert.  The Grassy Nose Salad Bar.  The Grassy Nose Salad Bar.  All part of the NRA-themed restaurant, right?  The Klebold Casserole. 
[01:52:30]  What's the matter?  Endless possibilities.  Damn you.  Son of sandwich.  Son of ham sandwich.  If the wages is late with your order, not only is it free, but you shoot the bitch.  Nova.  I taught you to smile.  Dr. Ziss. 
[01:53:00]  The Jeffrey...  Oh, God.  You guys are sick, man.  Let me get Brad to say it.  It's his line.  Brad, what's up?  Brad.  I got a name, uh, the Jeffrey Dahmer sampler.  Oh, God.  You can have a cold right out of the fridge.  Well, he didn't use guns, but that's close enough.  Damn you all to hell.  That's sick.  See what I did with that gorilla beneath the Planet of the Apes?  Yeah.  I shot them all.  Yes, you did.  Guns.  We need more guns in our restaurant.  Damn you. 
[01:53:30]  We're going to have a special lunch, uh, special for postal employees.  Yeah?  That come in.  Yeah, they bring their own guns.  Blow off some steam and some heads.  Bring in a gun, get a free, uh, appetizer?  Oh, man.  A David Koresh Kanish for our Hebrew friends.  Salad with Smith and Wesson oil and vinegar. 
[01:54:00]  Damn you.  Yes.  How about Fred Mandel ass?  How about...  I want my burger raw like, like Zira's ass when I pounded it when Cornelius was away.  He never found out.  How about the Leon...  I love monkey ass.  How about the Leon Klinghoffer cocktail?  Two shots and a splash.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, you could try the Eric Harris hot potato.  Ooh.  Colin Ferguson curly fries.  Colin Ferguson.  It's cute.  We'll have a little electric train set that'll bring it out for you.  To the sound of gunfire.  Gunfire.  And the kids could play in the electric chair?  Yes.  That's right.  Damn you.  You ever pound monkey ass, Opie? 
[01:55:00]  It's almost as good as shooting guns.  Anthony, let's not forget the Dwyer Bud draft.  Yes.  Very good.  That's Chris on line, too.  Thank you, Chris.  You sick F.  The Columbine sloppy Joe, Anthony.  Oh, God damn.  Check, please.  This bit's done.  Oh.

I assume we'll all be drinking Colt 45s.  Damn you.  The restaurant's slogan could be eat hot lead.  And instead of a drive-thru, they have a drive-by.  They're Amy Fisher and chips. 
[01:56:00]  That's great for you English blokes that are too faggy to have guns in your country.  Stupid bobbies with their sticks.  One gun and they take over the whole country.  Mr. Heston Berger from New Rochelle.  Yes.  The University of Texas Clock Tower Tea.  That's a good one.  The Martin Luther King Size Sandwich.  What's wrong with that? 
[01:56:30]  Hey, Mike.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I got two things.  Yeah.  I like to sit in my favorite John Wilkes booth and have my Brady vegetables.  The James Brady mixed vegetables.  Very good.  Yeah, there'll be a booth called the John Wilkes booth.  John Lennon Lemon Chicken.  What's wrong with that?  I did yourself.

The Gimme Your Wallet waffle fries and this is a robbery roast beef.

[02:01:00]  Oh, wow.  I thought we were bad.  Our listeners are 10 times worse than we are.  The Cobain head of lettuce.  Oh.  All right.  I can't imagine there's more out there.  No, I think we covered every major shooting in the past 50 years or so.  We go back to practically 200.  Yes, I forgot about that.  The Pope John Paul Poppers. 
[02:01:30]  Now, you know, you guys, come on.  Now do people forget he was shot.  Shot.  The Pope.  Parker from the city.  The Columbine Cacciatore.  The Manson Manicotti.  You kill him, we grill him.  I think we're done.  Can you say overkill?  Yeah, we kill everything for that.  We don't kill him.  Zodiac killer birthday cake. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  He died of breast cancer.  Why are you even bringing that up?  Linda McCartney.  You're insane.  It's not funny.  Puffy's rust.  It's made with rust meat.  All right.  Well, thank you for your contributions, you sick.  Aaron Burritos.

[02:03:00]  Sharon Tater tots.  God damn.  Larry Flynn fries.  Yeah, Larry Flynn was shot.  All right.  That's why we call it the People's Radio Show.  You guys are crazy.  Martin Luther King crap.  Flex. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, these people are out there.  No, Noreen Shatner floats.  She drowned you a-hole.  She certainly didn't float.  God, we came up with seven in the back room. 
[02:04:00]  We've had about a hundred on the radio.  Fatty Hurst, Liverwurst.  You're killing me.  Damn them all the hell.  Right.  All right.  I think we need to take a break, Anthony.  Please.  Because I'm not stopping.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole.  You guys suck.  Serious accent. 
[02:04:30]  Worst of Opie and Anthony, my name is E-Rock.  I am E-Rock Radio on Twitter, if you care to follow.  The show is off today.  It's Worst of Time, President's Day.  And we were not coming in because we were down in Atlantic City and having a good time  with Jim Norton, David Tell, Artie Lang, Amy Schumer, and other people.  We'll get to that on Tuesday when we return.  But for now, we're doing Worst of Lister Requests.  And if you went to our Facebook, you posted some shit.  Maybe we picked it.  Let's see.  This one is Sam Russo.  He wanted to hear the time.  We had Robert Kelly on. 
[02:05:00]  He was talking about the cum trees.  There were these trees in New York City that blossom in the early spring that Bobby says  smells like jizz and makes him cough and gag and he can't breathe.  So by knowing that and him telling us that, what did we do?  We hit it in the microphone.  I think there's video up on Opie Radio on YouTube.  I think he has video of this event up there.  So anyway, here it is.  Bob Kelly and the cum trees, jizz trees, whatever you want to call it right now.  It's the Worst of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:05:30]  Got a pretty good show going on today.  Bobby and Robert Kelly is going to join the festivities right now.  Where's Bobby?  Bring Bobby in.  Bring in Bob.  Bob Kelly running down the hall.  Look at this.  Bobby hasn't been on in a while.  I know.  He's been away in Los Angeles.  He's been a while since we've seen Bobby.  Bobby!  What are you doing in L.A.?  Where have you been?  Hi.  Hi, sweetie.  What's up?  What are you doing in L.A.?  Fucking dumb chair.  It's not you.  Why is it so high? 
[02:06:00]  Bobby's having trouble with the chair.  Fuck it, I'll stand.  Dude, yes, I'm...  You know what?  I am an L.A. guy kind of now.  Why?  I don't know what happened.  I quit smoking.  I woke up every day, ran up a canyon.  You run up canyons?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  It's just fucking trees. 
[02:06:30]  Please.  It's just fucking jizz trees in New York.  Why?  It's just fucking jizz trees in New York, you cunts.  You smell them?  You're fucking Jack in New York, Anthony.  Welcome home, Bobby.  Welcome home, Bobby.  I hate the fucking smell.  I think I was molested.  I think I was molested or something.  Please take this off. 
[02:07:00]  All right, we put the new one on.  Holy shit.  Is that funny?  Get her in.  Just go ahead.  Bobby, what is this all about?  Yeah, I don't understand what this is about.  What is this all about?  What are you talking about?  Cum trees in New York.  Dude, there's jizz trees in New York City.  What does that mean?  They do smell like cum.  They smell like fuck.  Smell that, dude.  Have you smelled them?  I smell that.  Smell it, Bobby.  It smells like a fucking someone. 
[02:07:30]  Like nine guys just dank on your cheek.  I can't fucking take it.  The whole neighborhood.  It stinks.  It smells like fucking jizz all the time.  Oh, God.  It smells.  You know when you.  Look, I fucking smell.  You know, you jerk off.  You get a little on your hand.  Yeah.  You get on your cheek.  Talk to the mic.  It smells like it.  It does.  I smelled it.  It was okay.  I mean, it was strong, but it wasn't that bad.  You're not a magician. 
[02:08:00]  I fucking dickhead.  I've seen him.  All right, Chris Sander.  Oops, sorry.  It's fucking terrible, dude.  I can't take it.  Yeah, you don't like that.  I don't like what?  Jizzy smell.  No.  No, I don't.  Do you?  I'm sorry.  No.  Am I stepping over a fucking Italian boundary?  Fucking disrespect my family.  Jizz is part of our lives.  This is what your fucking face would smell like if Anthony jizzed on it.  This is how much jizz comes out of his huge dick. 
[02:08:30]  So what?  Because the trees are blossoming.  They smell like cum.  Oh, the fucking microphone smells like cum.  And the microphone smells like a cum.  Dude.  You know what?  We all took a whiff.  Steve at the bar is a friend of mine.  Gets me my cum for free.  He gave me HIV.  HIV.  HIV. 
[02:09:00]  He bombs with his jokes.  He'll treat your cock like a smoke.  And stick it where food ought to be.  Bobby, we all took a whiff and it's a really, really bad smell.  Dude, I actually, I, I, this, this fucking, I was walking around all weekend smelling jizz.  And I'm just, I'm like, wondering why the fuck am I smelling that?  I started getting mad at my wife.  Oh, no.  I'm not kidding, dude.  I was walking around and I'm smelling it. 
[02:09:30]  She's like, do you smell it?  She's like, no.  And then I'm like, is this bitch, is this fuck, I, I, come here.  I was like, good old, let me smell your fucking face and chest and hands.  Like, are you fucking, did you do something?  How'd you finally find out what it was?  Dude, I, it had to be the fucking jizz trees, these white trees in New York City.  I grabbed, um, fuck, one of the leaves off it.  Well, it's not even leaves yet.  They're just blossoming.  So it's like the blossoming of the leaves is giving off this really bad smell. 
[02:10:00]  Do we know the actual name of the tree that, that, that you're calling the jizz tree?  Jizz tree.  I got a photo of it.  If you want to fucking give Danny some help.  We actually watched it on your YouTube, your, uh, video.  That's exactly, I think, I don't know, does, look, I know that it's pollen because I put  the thing to my nose and it was like a fucking jizzed all over my face because the pollen  was all over my face.  Ah.  I don't, does tree fuck, does tree fucking jizz smell like human jizz?  Can I ask you a question?  Yes, sir.  What smells worse?  Can I, can I do this?  What smells worse, that or my belly button? 
[02:10:30]  Your belly, your belly.  Can you smell, take a whiff of my belly button?  Dude, I don't have to, you could fucking.  I showered this morning.  You could put this jizz on a dead guy's belly button and then shit on it.  Well.  And I would say you.  Take a whiff of Jimmy's belly button and tell us which is worse.  You know what it smells like.  There's actually nothing there.  Oh, bro.  I showered like an asshole.  Yeah.  I do shower.  Listen, fucking magician boy.  I know your tricks.  The fucking asshole's still trying to do the fucking, uh.  I showered.  Small ball, little ball trick to me.  I get it. 
[02:11:00]  Fair enough.  Hang in there, Bobby.  Hang in there.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby, come on.  Hang in there.  And he's holding the jizz tree thing.  Come on, Bobby.  I haven't read his head yet.  This fucking jizz thing is terrible. 
[02:11:30]  You can't take jizz in massive amounts.  Well, you don't sound like a fun guy.  I can't.  What'd you say?  You don't sound like a very fun guy.  Can we take jizz?  Can you take jizz?  It's too much jizz, dude.  Can you take a full whiff of the jizz tree?  I just did.  It's fucking.  No, don't we have another bag of it somewhere?  Someone went out.  It does smell like cum, dude.  I mean, it really does.  Danny, you're a fucking mad smoker.  Like dirty, though.  It's dirty.  It smells a heck of a lot.  No, Bobby, we all smell this.  You fucking don't.  Why am I discovering this?  Hold on.  We're not happy with the smell, but you take it to a whole new level.  It's a horrible smell. 
[02:12:00]  But why?  But it makes you fucking puke.  Why am I discovering this?  Why hasn't this been discovered?  It's fucking 2010.  We have iPads and shit.  The jizz tree should have been fucking discovered in like the 1800s.  It's the jizz tree.  Yeah, like every 48 years, the jizz tree comes back and fucking blossoms and everybody smells  like fucking loads in Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen.  They're saying it's the flowering dogwood.  Someone else is saying it's the Bradford.  I think that's how you say it, too. 
[02:12:30]  Bradford pear?  There's probably a bunch of names.  Like chicken cacciatore is also fucking Hunter's chicken.  You know what I mean?  There's a bunch of names.  It is.  Derek mentioned dogwood.  Dogwood?  It does look like.  I mean, the flowers do look very similar.  It looks like it's the dogwood tree and they're blooming and it's giving off this horrendous  smell.  I don't know why I can't take this much load.  Oh, really?  You don't know?  You don't know why?  It brings you back to another time.  Snip that.  Yep.  It brings you back to when you were younger and you were trying to do something innocent  and an older man was coming into his own hand and feeding it to you like a little, 
[02:13:00]  like a zoo animal.  You're going to tell the story, be specific, in the closet.  When you buy the fucking grain out of the machine.  And he even knew not to curl his fingers in so you wouldn't bite his fingers like a  fucking horse eating an apple.  Loud hand.  I think Jimmy's on to something there, Bobby.  I think so.  Yeah, well, we got you.  It actually came up.  Sperm tree?  Spunk tree?  Yeah, well, according to the Urban Dictionary, there's a sperm tree, which is saying the 
[02:13:30]  same thing.  It smells like sperm.  It's the ornamental pear tree.  So let me pop that into some...  Spunk tree?  Sperm tree?  Look at that shit.  You see?  People thought of this before.  You're on to something, Bobby.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, that's it.  That's the fucking...  That's the jizz tree.  The ornamental pear tree.  That's the jizz tree of fucking New York City right there.  That's the culprit.  That's why all gay guys are walking around singing and smiling every afternoon.  Backing into trees.  That's why they all... 
[02:14:00]  I love the spring.  Of course you do.  So we figured out what the jizz tree is?  Yes.  Judging from the images and the Urban Dictionary, the jizz tree is indeed the ornamental pear  tree, everybody.  Ornamental pear tree.  A.K.A.  We got to the bottom of it, Bobby.  It's jizz tree.  Mystery has been solved.  Oh, fuck.  You really have a hard time with that.  It definitely loses its fucking potency after you cut it off the tree.  Or it dries up on your stomach. 
[02:14:30]  Just like regular jizz.  Yeah.  Yeah, when you peel it off an hour later, it doesn't have the same potency.  It's not as good when you have fruit roll up it off your belly and eat it.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  It tastes like grilled cheese.  It's not as good when you let the hot water hit it and it turns to fucking egg in the shower.  Yeah.  Fucking rubber cement on your stomach.  Who cares?  What are you doing?  I get really bad gas.  Do you?  Yeah, I get bad because I'm drinking the protein shakes at night.  Oh, they kill you, right?  Why are you picking your ass now, though, after you farted? 
[02:15:00]  Because my underwear was, like, fucked up and it was, like, caught in my asshole.  Oh, okay.  So I had to let it out.  That's a good one.  That's a pretty good one.  He's throwing it around now.  That's a pretty good one.  Danny?  I'm not getting any.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Go ahead, Rookie.  We deal with Jimmy's every day.  What do you got?  Jimmy's is a fucking Cyclone B.  After smelling Jim's last, what was that, Thursday, that was?  It was.  Was it bad?  Oh, my God.  Worst ever from Jimmy in all the years I've known him.  Yeah.  Worst fart ever was last Thursday.  My farts were putrid. 
[02:15:30]  It's not like somebody was burning Al Sharpton.  This is exactly what.  And then in the parking garage before I left, as I was getting in the driver's side door.  He sucked your cock?  Yeah.  He sucked my cock.  It was fantastic.  I shut my door as I got in and looked over, and his ass was in my passenger door farting.  So I had to drive with that fucking smell in my car.  It was great.  I dropped a fucking nice gasser in his truck and closed the door.  It fucking hung me like a ghost.  Yeah.  It was terrible.  Dude, this is exactly what a fucking gay porn set smells like. 
[02:16:00]  The gist tree.  Just the fucking, that clean, kind of clean, dirty smell.  It smells exactly like the peepoos.  Yeah.  It's exactly like peepoos.  It's just like old, dirty.  Just old, old jism in the air.  I know.  Oh, there's old jizz in the air.  That smell makes me want to pick my chewing gum up off the floor.  Oh, my God.  You're disgusting.  Did you ever step in somebody's jizz?  Dude, I fucking moonwalk through it.  I fucking peepoos. 
[02:16:30]  Fucking gimme.  Oh, I don't care, man.  Peepoos don't bother me at all, man.  I haven't been in a while.  You laugh at peepoos?  I do.  I really do.  I'd fucking take flip-flops into a peepoos.  I've never been in a peepoos.  Wow.  I've never been in one.  Like, I've been in one of the booths that play, like, the movies.  Yeah, that's what I've been to.  I've never seen it live.  I've never been, like, a live girl peepoos.  Oh, I'm talking about the movie booths.  Oh, and peepoos.  Okay, I've been in those.  No, we were in with my brother. 
[02:17:00]  Were the girls in the middle?  You told me about that.  I wasn't in there, though.  Yeah, back in the day.  That was way back in the day.  Oh, wait a minute.  We were in?  Looking across?  Yeah.  Yeah, we all had our own window, and we were looking across at each other.  That was the old school, man.  We could see each other.  When it was like a genie's bottle.  That's terrible.  And they had the chicks inside.  Oh, she was awful, right.  And my brother grabbed...  Who was licking her box?  Not one of us.  There's somebody licking box, like...  Who the fuck would do that?  Dude, I licked asshole for $3.  You would lick a box out of the...  Wow.  I licked a Filipino's asshole for $3.  You're crazy. 
[02:17:30]  Dude, no.  It was pretty good.  That was his name, Phil Apino.  He's an Italian guy.  He's an old boxer.  Big fucking hairy.  Bob thought he said Phil Esposito, and he'd have a great ranger story.  No, I remember one girl, because they could climb over the thing to get...  Hey, Bobby, come here.  Hey.  You're back again.  Lick my fucking ass.  Dude, go ahead.  Put the ones away.  I don't fucking...  We're friends.  Guy, lick that ass.  I remember the girl could escape by climbing out of the octagon.  It was kind of like an octagon, and everyone had their own little area with a tiny little 
[02:18:00]  square window.  You could stick your head through.  And my brother grabbed his hand...  Reached his arm through and grabbed the woman's leg.  She was not happy with that.  No.  It was a great one on 54th.  Me and Valsh used to go to it.  It was on 54th, right off of Broadway.  You do Caroline's and go...  It makes it sound like going to a Broadway show.  Well, it was better than that.  Me and Valsh just goes fabulous.  Fine.  You see cats.  I'll eat a girl's ass.  I literally did.  Five bucks I didn't ask for.  It was...  And then Giuliani came in, and that's where a lot of that stopped.  Because when Dinkins was mayor, it was great. 
[02:18:30]  But when Giuliani came in, all that closed down.  The old Laugh Factory used to be one of the best ones, because it had downstairs, it had  all the booths and the movies.  Upstairs, it had two different types of windows.  The ones with the glass with the phone, which you would take out a dildo and rub it out for  it.  Prison visit.  It was a real good one, though.  The thing was up the whole time, though.  It was a little more expensive.  Then they had the windows.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You had to pick up the phone, though?  Yeah, you had to put that fucking...  Smell someone else's bad breath?  That's like a theme of the show today.  That'd be the jizz fucking phone. 
[02:19:00]  You had to pick up the jizz phone and talk to the jizz lady?  Yeah, I had to talk to her, yeah.  Before you licked her asshole, you fucking sick fuck.  Dude, I fucking licked her ass.  I ate her asshole.  I stuck it in.  Like, I hardened my tongue.  But why would you do that?  You know what I mean?  I made my tongue into a little baby dick.  Why would you do that, Bobby?  And you don't care about the diseases or anything?  That makes me fucking paranoid as hell.  Put diseases aside.  That just fucking...  Diseases aside.  No, no, I'm saying...  What disease can you get from a girl's asshole? 
[02:19:30]  I don't fucking want to know.  You can't get hepatitis from a girl's asshole.  It's like she's not clean.  Yeah, she is.  She had baby wipes.  No, stop it.  She baby wiped her ass in between licks?  There's a box of baby wipes in the middle of the fucking room,  and that's all they do is...  Did you force a baby wipe before you got in there?  No.  She's...  No.  They fucking...  Oh, you want to smell like a mushroom.  I understand.  Yeah.  I mean, sure.  But yeah, she's working all day.  She's probably a dick in her ass.  I was a pig trying to get truffles.  Other guys... 
[02:20:00]  Other guys fucking licking her ass.  Baby wipe takes that right out.  Oh, does it?  Yeah, it takes it right out.  Yeah.  Yeah, it takes that fucking rotten tooth smell out from that guy,  that English teacher that was in before you.  Oh, Blair, let me lick your ass.  Bring your ass over here.  Yeah.  He's got a pipe.  One of Mike Schmidt's mustache hairs in her asshole.  I used to look...  Oh, man.  Those are the best ones, though.  You can stick your fucking head in and touch.  Those are the best.  I remember when we first got here, me, Burr, Patrice, Dane, 
[02:20:30]  and three other guys all came to New York,  went to one of those,  and we all got in the booth at the same time,  and it just, our heads popped out.  So it was just our heads, like, dude, what's up?  What's up?  Just looking at each other.  There should have been a guillotine above it.  How much better comedy would be.  But that's what we did.  That's what we did, man.  We all had our heads popping out into the octagon  as she was trying to, like, dance sexy,  and we were just fucking around with her.  Patrice ran out of cash,  so he fucking popped into mine. 
[02:21:00]  He was like, yo, Bobby, Bobby.  Yo, tell her to come over here.  He had me head like this fucking girl walk up.  He was honing in on your action.  It was my head, like, hey, excuse me, can you hear me?  And just his eyes in the background of those little rooms.  Looked like the opening from Scooby-Doo.  Bob's farting.  What do you want me to do, rookie?  Get out of the way?  I was like, farting right on Jim.  Let me say hi to an Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Ant. 
[02:21:30]  I went to one of those deep boots,  and we were drunk at the time.  The girl wanted more money,  and I was flat out of cash.  And she's like, come on, more money, more money.  I'm like, ah, fuck you, you skank.  She goes, what did you call me?  Good one.  Next thing I know, she turns around.  She's got a lighter and a bottle of hairspray,  and she goes, I will light you on fire.  Oh, that's good.  And what did you say, faggot?  Yeah.  I waited until the door shut,  then I ran out of here and was cursing her out,  and then the Indian gentleman from around the booth 
[02:22:00]  came out and threw us out.  Wow.  That's an incredible story.  Yeah, what would it be better if she fucking...  Sex, danger, it had everything.  Yes, an Indian man.  What story is it made better by an Indian man doing something?  Every story needs an Indian man, as far as I'm concerned.  We should add one.  Hold on.  You know, Leo's right here.  Leo in Cleveland.  Seamless.  Bobby, you can put your tongue on a dirty Filipino's asshole,  but you almost puke when you smell a pear tree.  No, it's a fucking jizz tree, and it smells like jizz. 
[02:22:30]  He makes a point, because it's not actually jizz,  but you can lick a fucking Filipino's asshole.  Yeah, it smells like a fucking dirty Filipino's asshole.  Yeah, it didn't smell, though.  Asshole doesn't smell.  Yes, it does sometimes.  Sometimes.  I don't mind it.  It doesn't smell.  I want to know it's an asshole.  Can we rub this all over your body?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  So I don't want to smell like jizz.  I'm going to the fucking 48th Street gym.  It's all fucking gay guys.  Oh, God damn.  Just walk in and be attacked.  You'll smell like jizz afterwards.  I'll be catnip.  I'll be like, exactly.  I was going to say, walking like potpourri. 
[02:23:00]  I'll be attacked and dragged into a sauna.  They're all going to be clawing Bob's back, trying to climb up him.  Like fucking vampires.  Let's say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Uh-oh.  Yes, it's the most wonderful time of the year.  The trees are booming.  The fragrance is blooming.  It's fun to be queer.  It's the most wonderful time of the year. 
[02:23:30]  Wow.  Thank you, Steve.  That was awesome.  I love it.  I've seen Steve call in every so often.  I like when Steve calls in.  Good evening.  That song was so good.  I like it.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Jimmy James.  Morning, boys.  Jesus.  Just wondering if you wanted a horrific walking through jizz story.  Sure.  Why not?  All right.  Well, I inspect fire sprinkler systems for a living.  And I was up at a fraternity house at a prestigious college in New Hampshire.  And I happened to be inspecting the rooms. 
[02:24:00]  Found a garden tool closet with the back cut out.  So I wandered in through, and I walk into this probably six-by-four room.  All that's in it is a little table with a TV-DVD combo, a pile of pornos, used toilet paper, stacked about knee-deep.  So it was like wading through a bog of jizz.  And the TV screen on this thing basically looked like somebody had a lit candle and was just shaking it at the TV for hours on end. 
[02:24:30]  It was the worst experience of my life, and apparently not as good a story as I thought.  Another fascinating story.  All right, brother.  It wasn't that bad a story, bro.  Let me say hi to Anthony in Mount Sinai.  Bobby, dude, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Filipina's asshole?  A one, two, or three?  And then he bites the roid.  Three.  There you go.  That's funny.  It's a nice mouthful of blood. 
[02:25:00]  Like a piece of freshen up.  Blood and a varicose vein is in between my teeth like dental floss.  You ever chew a roid?  It's terrible for bubble blowing.  Blubble blowing.  Yes, for blubble blowing.  It's kind of like bubble blowing, but it's not funny.  I don't like the video.  I mean, the video ones are real frustrating because you've got to put the money in and then just sit there and hit up, down, up, up, up, down, A, B, C, D, and just keep rolling through.  There's computers now.  Why do you fucking got to go to a booth to watch a movie? 
[02:25:30]  There's something fun about it.  There's something dirtier about it, dude.  Yeah, you're sneaking in.  Not even sneaking, just walking right in, right to the back.  Yeah.  Yeah, looking for shiny stuff on the floor, on the seat.  Do I stand up?  Do I try to sit down?  Do I kneel?  Do I lay in the fetal position and weep?  Do I tap the walls and hope a little hole falls out?  Like, go to Dr. Jekyll's restaurant.  What is this?  Bobby, do one more before we go to break.  What is that? 
[02:26:00]  That's the jizz tree in the bag.  In the bag.  This one, the white bag.  It's desensitized.  Yeah, Bob is...  Oh, really?  No, no, no.  Let's do one more.  Your receptors get deadened.  They do.  That's filled with more jizz tree stuff.  Is that true?  Yeah, they do.  So if you smell cum all the time?  If you're just smelling something all the time, then you stop smelling it because your receptors  get used to it.  One more time, Bobby.  Put your head right in there and smell the jizz tree.  I don't like...  Hang on one second.  I don't like the tricks that you fucking assholes are trying to pull on me. 
[02:26:30]  Trixie Hobbit.  Yeah, you use receptors.  What do you fuck?  They do.  Both of you and you fucking tricks.  People work in the sewer.  I...  Shut up.  I mean, people work in the sewer and they actually...  Down in the sewer.  I know that's going to smell like jizz, you dickwads.  I'm going to do it.  You don't have to trick me.  One more time.  Hang on one second.  Give it a good one.  Give it a good whiff.  I'm dropping it on like a feed bag.  Yeah.  Good whiff.  Go, Bobby.  Smell the jizz tree one more time.  See?  You haven't gotten used to it.  No, I think it's died.  Yeah?  It's not as bad. 
[02:27:00]  It smells a little...  You're used to it.  Your jizz tree hits dying.  I don't think you can have it.  You've got to take it out, dude.  All he did...  Bob's got a little tent in his pants now.  I'm getting a little carried away.  I'm starting to eat it.  Yeah, you really are.  I'm just starting to eat it and rub it on my ass all.  I'm just wearing it in his hair like Jenny Gump.  You know what you've got to do?  I want to rub it on every cup of my own.  You've got to...  Rub it in your hands like rosin.  Crush it up like Jim Cook.  Like rosin.  No, rub it in your hands like rosin.  Like Jim Cook does with hops.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know how he takes the hops and then smells them? 
[02:27:30]  Rub it in your hands.  I think I'm used to it.  He's used to it, dude.  I think I'm used to it.  Yeah.  I think I'm used to it.  Yeah, we helped you.  I real come.  You helped me what?  Become a fucking faggot?  Now everybody...  A homo.  Let's bukkake, Jimmy.  You helped me become...  Why me?  All right.  Why am I then?  My fantasy just came out.  Sorry.  Why is he the lucky boy?  Yeah.  Not my birthday.  Why does he get all the fucking...  What do you think I brought this up for, asshole?  I had a plan in mind.  I mean, he just ruined it.  How funny was it when Forrest got married and Jenny had the flowers in her hair?  And then two weeks later, he was talking to her under a tree like a fucking shepherd. 
[02:28:00]  He buries her in the yard instead of springing for a fucking...  Instead of springing for a nice grave.  Ah, Jenny.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Forrest is so strange.  She was such a fucking...  What an asshole.  Fucked him his whole fucking retard life.  Yeah.  And then right when he got Apple stock, she came back in and swooped in and died with AIDS.  He sits on his dick with AIDS.  Yeah.  What a trooper.  Fucking bitch.  And take this little mongoloid with you.  Yeah.  This fucking twat.  I hated her.  Here's something to take care of forever. 
[02:28:30]  Fucking cunt.  Exactly.  No more fucking...  No Joan Baez songs for me.  I got the fucking hibs, silly.  You and your fucking no-leg lieutenant friend and his fucking war bride.  I enjoyed my life to the fullest.  Now I'm going to pull the cord, die, and take this shit dick with you.  Exactly.  So take your giant, delicious retard cock and keep running, broke legs.  Fucking giant, delicious comes in two seconds cock.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, he couldn't hold it in.  Of course he touched his dick and he... 
[02:29:00]  That ruins your roommate's robe.  That's because he was looking at her roommate.  Let's go to Jennifer in Chicago.  Big Bobby Kelly fan.  Jenny.  What's up, Jennifer?  Hi, Bobby.  Hi, Mama.  Hi, how are you?  Good, sweetie.  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  You smoking a pack a day, honey?  No, I'm fighting a little bit of a cold.  Oh, really?  Are you?  It's the spring and you got a cold.  That's fucking odd.  Go ahead.  I'm a big fan of Bobby Kelly.  Yes, I want to be both deep into my episode of Boy's Eyes. 
[02:29:30]  Yes!  Could you repeat that?  We didn't hear it.  I don't know what that was.  He sounded...  At the beginning of that call, he sounded like the older version of the mom from Back  to the Future.  Yeah.  That was an incredible play in this.  That's funny.  She really did just did an old person voice.  There was no acting.  Nothing.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  So, Bobby, what are you promoting? 
[02:30:00]  Des Moines.  Yeah.  Wow.  West Des Moines?  I don't know where the fuck I am, dude.  Funny Bone in West Des Moines, Iowa.  Yeah.  Oh, somebody wants to go there and get married, doesn't he?  Yeah.  I'm going to Cleveland.  To...  And then...  But the big show that I have is Boston coming up in July.  The Wilbur.  I got one show that I want to fill out.  All right.  That's cool.  When is that?  Yeah.  When is that?  It's in July.  In July?  Let's go to my website, robertkellylive.com, and my dates are up there.  Yeah, let's do that.  My Twitter, my Facebook, everything.  Dude, you killed in Atlantic City.  I know we'll get back to beating you up, but...  That was a fun show.  That was a great show. 
[02:30:30]  You and Patrice, man.  Wow.  That was a good show.  Solid show.  I was fucking losing my mind, because that's the week I quit smoking cigarettes, too.  You wanted to fucking strangle somebody.  Are you smoking?  No, I'm done.  It's been a month and two weeks.  Fucking good.  Not as bad?  No, now it's great.  Because you met me for a little dinner, or stopped by to say hi, and you were in...  He was insane.  He looked like he was going to kill somebody.  It was...  Because I fucked up.  I quit smoking, and the first week I'm in Atlantic City, and then the next week I'm  in Vegas.  And when you go to...  Oh, yeah.  When you smoke, when you smoke, those are places you smoke. 
[02:31:00]  Yep.  You sit, and you have a butt, and you fucking...  And I was sitting there just fucking shaking.  And the smoke was in the air everywhere.  I felt like I wanted to smoke.  There was so much smoke going on.  You were smoking if you go in those places.  Yeah, basically, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Those Asians light up every two fucking seconds.  And I...  Hey, hit me!  Hit me!  I'm gonna, you fuck!  I also realized that your wife's a...  Skinny little fingers.  Your wife's a sick fuck.  Cigarettes.  Why?  Because you're trying to quit smoking, and she's right next to you smoking.  She's done now, too.  Yeah, but you didn't stop... 
[02:31:30]  You should have quit at the same time is what I'm getting at.  She had a date.  She did the whole fucking read about it.  This is what you're supposed to do.  She picked a date, and I'm quitting Monday.  I just woke up one day and said, fuck it.  Yeah.  And just quit, and just stopped, and got a couple pieces of gum, and started chewing  it, and that was it.  And then...  Chew it for fucking 15 years like Voss.  No, not that.  I fucking did that for a couple days and stopped, because I didn't want to fucking be addicted  to it.  So you're on no patch, nothing?  Nothing.  I'm done.  And the urge isn't bad?  No, I don't have an urge.  Talk to your friend Voss. 
[02:32:00]  How many years has he been chewing the gum at this point?  He's just awful.  We lost track.  It's fucking...  It's gotta be three, four years.  That gum's terrible, too.  You just can't stop fucking chewing that gum.  It's bad, dude.  Fuck that.  I didn't want to be addicted to that shit.  Just talking with it in his mouth.  It's like flying out.  Yeah.  Plus, it's expensive.  The fucking gum's really expensive to buy that shit all the time.  Why don't you just buy regular gum?  Because now it's just a gum habit.  That's what I did.  I switched it over to regular...  I just had regular gum that looked like that, and I just started chewing that instead  of the fucking stuff.  But...  Dude, I can...  This is weird. 
[02:32:30]  You can smell...  This is probably why the jizz tree is fucking with me, because I can be in the elevator  now and smell somebody's rotten tooth.  Like...  Like...  Like...  Halitosis.  The smell's gotten very good.  That's the worst smell ever.  It's the...  It's like metallic-y.  It's disgusting.  Oh.  I was on a plane coming back from L.A. a few weeks ago, and the guy next to me, his  breath was rancid, and he was in the seat next to me, and I could smell his fetid breath.  Fetid.  And I wanted to fucking elbow him in the mouth.  When I used to work with the retards, my boss, her mother worked on Saturdays and Sundays 
[02:33:00]  in the morning, downstairs, and her teeth were fucking, like, props.  They were just jagged fucking props.  They just came in at 19 different directions.  They were brown, wooden fucking teeth.  Oh, shit.  Looked like frosted mini-weights.  And she...  Her...  You would...  They would...  All around the house would be spray and napkins near every phone, because she would use the 
[02:33:30]  phone, and the fucking stank...  Wow.  And everybody had to, like, spray and...  I would throw up.  You know me.  I'd puke.  I'd go to answer the phone.  Hey.  Fucking puke.  What would you do if she had, like, just sucked on your nose for a minute, and her breath  dried on your nose?  Dude, I'm just...  Dude, I'm glad she was only, like, fucking 4'2", so I didn't have to be, like, when she  talked to me.  Yeah, mouthed her nose.  Fucking disgusting teeth.  Did she know her breath was terrible?  No.  She have to.  Well, you know what?  I had fucked up teeth.  The plaque.  You know the plaque?  When I smoked and drank, and I didn't have dental, like, around 10 years ago... 
[02:34:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Dude, I got fucking halitosis.  And somebody told me about it.  Like, dude, your breath stinks.  And I went to the dentist, and it was plaque.  When you smoke and drink, plaque, the white shit, that's the shit that stinks.  It's...  I don't know what the fuck it is.  It's bacteria, but it forms into, like, a tooth.  I was flossing.  I went to floss, and it fucking a piece...  It looked like a chunk of tooth came out.  It was plaque.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:34:30]  So now...  You ever smell your dental floss?  I go to the dentist.  Why wouldn't you?  Four times...  Every four months, I go to the dentist now for a cleaning.  Yeah, I don't fuck around anymore.  Now that I have dental.  I went many years without it, too.  Look at that shit.  I don't fuck around.  Yeah, you got some of mine, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ugh, plaque is the worst.  Plaque?  Ugh.  You ever smell your own breath on a coffee cup in the morning?  Not a coffee cup, but a water bottle in the morning.  Sometimes it's like, what the fuck?  I brushed and did everything, but...  Are you drinking coffee?  That's never a good thing. 
[02:35:00]  No.  I used to date a girl, a breath smelled like mustard all the time.  I fucking hate it.  I love mustard on a sandwich, but not on the fucking...  But not on breath.  You wake up, it just smells like deli mustard.  And I'll teach you to fuck girls who work at the carnival.  She worked at Nathan's stand.  You know, when you was a little boy, you used to love that flower rubbed on your chest.  Ah, fuck.  I'd tickle your nose with it.  You know, if your mouth smelled like pussy, you would think it was bad breath. 
[02:35:30]  But then if you go down on a girl, you don't care at all.  You love it.  Pussies are fucking trowsious.  Some pussy is fucking nasty.  What's wrong with you?  Well, some is, but...  It doesn't smell good.  It doesn't fucking smell good.  There's no...  You get over the smell, and you get used to the smell because it's pussy, and you have  to go down there and man up.  No, no, no.  It gets you all fucking, like, worked up.  It gets turned on.  It's not a fucking aphrodisiac, man.  It's not fucking dog juice.  I love it.  Most pussy smells like a homeless guy's burping in your face.  Yeah.  It's fucking terrible. 
[02:36:00]  You ever open two pussy lips and just take a whiff?  Yeah, you get a lick.  Homeless guy without teeth, right?  You have to lick the stink off it sometimes.  I don't mind it.  I'll actually just smell it.  I'll actually have a pussy on my face.  And again, not, like, a really filthy pussy, but a little dirty pussy, like, after a good  sweaty.  I'll just sniff it and smell the...  I'm not even kidding.  Smell it and smell the ass while I get my dicks up.  I love it.  Do you ever open up a pussy and it sounds like you're opening up like a grilled cheese sandwich?  Yes.  Oh, my God. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  That's awful.  That's when there's a yeast infection.  It's all the white stuff, right?  Yeah, she looks like she has manic depressive mouth in her pussy.  It's like, what are you eating?  Fucking...  Are you eating Haldol?  She's got fucking...  Yeah, she's got the white stuff in the corner of her pussy.  Yeah, it's sickening.  What are you, bipolar?  You fucking idiot.  Just run a fucking marathon without any water?  What's worse than someone on fucking meds, the fucking spittle in the corner of their  mouth.  It's like you want to wipe it off and make them smell it.  Clean your mouth.  Put a handshake. 
[02:37:00]  Who farted now?  Oh, no.  He's showing us horrible pictures.  Not that it matters, but a lot of dentists are pissed off.  It's tartar, not plaque that you're talking about.  Oh, dentists listen to the show?  I'm surprised myself.  Oh, wait.  Hang on a second.  What is it?  What is it?  It's fucking Zell calling in.  It's tartar.  Tartar.  Tartar built up.  Well, plaque.  What is plaque, then?  Well, let's...  I mean, fucking...  We're talking about pussies, but all right.  Anthony, Mount Sinai, you're a dentist?  Yes, I am, gentlemen.  All right.  Let's go.  All right.  You ready?  When you have the dirty plaque that Bobby's not cleaning off his teeth... 
[02:37:30]  No, I wasn't.  I am now, you fucking jackass.  Listen, doctor.  Doctor.  Sorry, doctor.  I was listening, Bobby.  Ooh.  Don't get a tone.  Before, when you were a dirty bird and weren't cleaning it off, what happens is the ions  in your saliva cause the plaque to harden and become what's called calculus, or the layman's  turn is tartar.  Gotcha.  What is plaque?  Placke is the bacteria that form, that are eating the food that you're not cleaning off 
[02:38:00]  your teeth properly.  What is...  So what is a big causer of tartar?  Causer?  Yes, a big causer of tartar.  A big causer of tartar?  Besides drinking when pregnant.  Yeah.  What causer weight would you take to get here?  Calculus.  Wow.  Yeah, it's a big hunk of tartar.  It's like, it's like, uh, chipping barnacles off the boat.  Yeah.  Are you, if you, if you pulled a big thick piece of tartar off someone's teeth and you, 
[02:38:30]  and somebody held it in their hands, would you be able to smell it?  Yeah, you could probably smell it.  It doesn't smell that bad.  The plaque is worse, but the tartar is pretty disgusting.  What, yeah, what, what, what, a lot of you guys end up killing yourselves, right?  There's a high suicide, no, I'm serious, there's a high suicide rate among dentists,  and I think it's because they can't deal with the smells after a while.  Now, that's kind of an old wives' tale.  We're number two behind, uh, policemen, actually.  Well, that's not an old wives' tale, then.  A lot of you fuckers are killing themselves. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, cops, at least, you know, they drink and they're constantly stressed.  What is it with dentists?  Thank you for calling us a bunch of fuckers now, Ope.  What is it with dentists?  I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm teasing, it's fine, I love you guys, I've been listening forever.  Now I feel bad about myself.  It's because no one likes the dentist.  They don't feel liked.  I'm driving to work right now in a car, I might just crash it into a fucking telephone pole.  Atta boy.  Did you ever finger fuck a girl that was out there on nitrous?  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  No nitrous in the office.  Did you ever think about it? 
[02:39:30]  Nope.  Yeah, you thought about it.  Yeah, that's right.  I hear you guys talk about it all the time, and it's just, it is creepy.  That happens a lot in Jersey, I don't know why.  It's Jersey.  All right, Anthony, the dentist, thank you.  Later.  All right, there you go.  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Ope and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Worst of Ope and Anthony, my name is E-Rock.  Hi, how are you?  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  The show is off today.  In case you didn't know from the previous hours, if you're just tuning in, we'll be back tomorrow. 
[02:40:00]  It's President's Day, so of course we're going to take the time off.  We'll get it any way that we can.  We're doing listener requests.  Worst of, if you post it on our Facebook page, perhaps I picked your bit.  If I haven't, maybe this is you.  And if not, maybe you can try again next time.  This one is Michael Biggins.  So, Michael Biggins, this is your request.  Everyone else, you're shit out of luck.  Maybe next time.  He requested the time.  Jim Jeffries was on after St. Patrick's Day, and he was hung over and drunk. 
[02:40:30]  Look, this bit, yeah, so Jim came in.  It was, I'm going to say maybe, I don't have the date.  I think it's like 2011, 2010, 2011, somewhere in that ballpark.  He came in.  It was right the day after St. Patrick's Day.  He was up all night.  He was drunk, maybe tripping a little bit.  Who knows what he was doing?  He's a big star now, by the way.  I'm going to throw in a plug for his show.  Legit on FX.  If you haven't watched it, it's very good.  You should go definitely watch it.  Anyway, he was in, and this was also the day we had Justine Jolie in, and he tried to ask her out.  And things didn't go too well. 
[02:41:00]  So here it is, Jim Jeffries, and that's all you need to know.  This is the worst of all the other, serious XM.  Jim, she wants you to get up so she can do the hoka.  I'll do it.  What are you doing?  Yeah, do the hoka hoka dance.  Jim Jeffries will be doing the hoka hoka dance with Justine Jolie.  This might work out well for anyone.  Oh, yeah, no, it's not.  You're kind of not coordinated.  It's pretty rancid.  You can get it through denim.  I don't know if I want to do it now.  I'm a little scared.  Do the hoka hoka. 
[02:41:30]  Hoka hoka.  Let's hoka hoka.  Come on.  You're scared.  Let's see the hoka hoka dance.  Let's do the hoka hoka.  No, you got one more scene, Reg.  You're not done.  You got one more line at the hoka hoka dance.  So you're actually going to do it with me here?  No, I won't do it.  I'm just kidding.  She's got to learn it.  I will be.  He's got to learn it.  All right, I'll do it.  I'll do it.  All right, here you go.  We need more room, so you've got to scooch over.  As long as he gets on the internet, because I know how much I enjoy being appalling.  This is the end part of the dance, where he's actually supposed to be grinding on me? 
[02:42:00]  No, the end part is me spurting over your leg.  Really?  I was like, wow, you did have a shit ton to drink last night.  Fuck.  Fuck.  I stink, don't I?  Holy fuck.  Wow.  My snot is like a rock of fucking coke.  I'm not doing the hoka hoka with him anymore.  Holy shit.  What's him out of here?  A little bit of booze?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:42:30]  I've drunken too much.  You do porn.  Whose parents are more fucking disappointed?  Not mine.  All right, come on, hoka hoka dance.  I already did, man.  I humped up on you.  That's part of the dance.  Don't lick me, you'll get drunk.  Oh, yeah, I will.  How the fuck did you drink last night?  Vodka?  Alcohol.  Obviously, alcohol.  The dreams of young children.  It was St. Paddy's Day. 
[02:43:00]  All right, do the hoka hoka dance.  Come on.  She's unbuttoning her shirt.  I know, because he's supposed to be humping back, and he's not.  You can touch those nipples all you want, but they're just dead bits of skin.  I know.  I don't really need that.  That is...  See, I'm trying to do the hoka hoka, guys, but he's...  All I am is cock, testicles, and anus.  The rest of it is a dead zone.  Really?  Grind back on her a little bit.  Grind back.  She wants her to do the hoka hoka.  I don't even know...  I love it.  He's like, oh...  Do the hoka hoka, you fool. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  Do you want a hoka hoka?  Yes.  Hoka hoka.  You hoka hoka.  You hoka hoka.  I don't know how to do it.  What, you think?  I'm fucking adept to these things?  Do the hoka hoka with Justine Jolie.  You stick your big cock in, you pull your big cock out.  You put your big cock in, and you shake it all about.  Yeah.  You do the hoka hoka.  You put your warts in.  You turn around.  Then you don't give her her phone number.  I'm so sad to want your phone number. 
[02:44:00]  Come on.  There's a lot of sexual tension between me and you.  I think you like me.  You're very cute.  I am cute, aren't I?  You are really fucked up right now.  Would you like to go on a date with me?  Me and you.  Come on.  Oh, man.  I have very small fists.  No, you don't.  Put your hand up to mine.  Because my hand's perfect.  Ooh, actually, he does have pretty decent hands for fisting.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  I actually...  Look.  They only overlap my...  And my hands are perfect for fisting.  I assume I could lose a watch in you.  Not that I haven't done it a ton or anything. 
[02:44:30]  What?  Nothing.  When was the last time you watched that motherfucker?  I watched it today.  I hope by not peeing on it.  No.  This is just awkward radio now.  Are you going to go out with me or not?  No more hopping?  All right.  If you think you're too good for me.  I didn't say I was too good for you.  I just said I didn't want to go out with you.  He has a gazebo.  I thought you have a really nice apartment.  I have a studio flat, which has a pungent smell that I can't find. 
[02:45:00]  Really?  But I'm going to endeavor to find that.  I wish you luck.  And then you'll get quite the raping.  I'm just entertaining Anthony now.  That's fucking hysterical.  Yeah, right on.  You are un-fucking-believable.  I'm so fucking wasted now.  You stood up.  I don't even know I'm stood up.  You're like, oh. 
[02:45:30]  Erick brought it for you, not me.  I love you.  Mommy just brought you some juice.  He's doing the hoka-hoka with the fucking bottle now.  Yeah, now he's more interested in the booze.  I love you.  I love you too, Mommy.  And I mean that.  I love you.  I've never been in love before.  How come?  Well, my mother never held me.  Aw.  No, she held me.  Just, I didn't like her.  It's just getting awkward.  Don't touch me. 
[02:46:00]  Don't touch me?  Why don't you want to be touched?  I know.  I'm trying to tickle him to make him laugh now.  He's cock, balls, anus, and all the rest is just a dead cell.  See, this is my theory.  I don't like kissing girls, right?  I used to like kissing girls when I was like 14 or 15, but then after I got my dick sucked,  I was over kissing.  I look at kissing like, why would I ride in the swings when I've already been to Disneyland?  Okay.  That makes perfect sense.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  It's just that there's no...  I don't have my cock sucked. 
[02:46:30]  Kissing is down a dead zone for me.  There's no thrill.  What happened?  That's really unfortunate, because that's one of the main things that I really enjoy about a man.  This is how we can change each other.  Being able to make out.  Yeah.  What?  We can change each other.  I don't even know what to fucking say to that at all.  He's like leaving.  We can make each other more respectable.  That's your fucking problem, Miss.  More respectable as he takes another step.  I'm telling you, you can't be happy with your life, and look at me.  You think this is what I fucking thought would happen? 
[02:47:00]  Oh, no.  I can tell you're not so happy.  I'm just saying.  What are you doing, my life?  Oh, look at the...  I'm off the television!  You should have sex with me.  I'm off the TV.  Really?  Not really.  Once.  I was on the TV once.  Did you sit on top of it?  How were you on the TV?  Oh, damn.  Now it's just gotten awkward.  I'm going to go back to my chair.  I've got my beer now. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, you're good now.  I've been a little bit rapey.  Rapey?  It just makes...  Any time you get up and you're slightly more creepy than Rich Voss, you know you've gone  too far.  It's so funny, man.  I had my moments, but if it's edited together badly, I look like a hack.  Who's editing this?  You're funny.  Yeah, it's going to go.  That would imply effort post-show. 
[02:48:00]  And you guys don't do any effort?  No.  No.  No, no.  Zero effort in this.  You guys didn't finish the...  I'm not...  We already shot the load of that.  That fucking...  We already got the last piece.  I'll do the dance.  All right.  Oh, you want to do the...  The hoka-hoka?  Are you kidding?  Of course I would.  Okay.  Do the hoka-hoka, man.  We've got to move all of this stuff.  I tried doing it.  I'm going to go pig.  I got a weird smell on my jeans.  No, it's coming out your mouth, darling.  It ain't coming from your jeans.  Oh, shit.  I love...  I'm glad that I got to do the scene with you.  No, that was just because I jizzed down my jeans. 
[02:48:30]  I think we made a good...  I'm glad I got to do the scene with you.  Oh.  Anthony, have I been funny?  No, you're going to do it with me, right?  Jim Jeffries.  I've been so waste.  Have I been disgraced or have I actually been funny?  No.  Absolutely funny as a motherfucker.  Funny.  A great appearance.  So, we're going to do this?  You can't hold that while doing this.  I'll put it down.  I will try my best.  I do not know how to dance, but I will definitely attempt it.  Okay.  All right.  Danny's going to do the hoka-hoka.  The hoka-hoka.  Would you move, Sam?  Yes, absolutely.  Move to the other side.  Jesus. 
[02:49:00]  Can you get that black pussy hair out of my face?  Do you think she'll actually go out with me if I ask her afterwards?  No.  No, I don't need that.  Not a shot.  Neither of us have anything.  I'm still going to do it, though, right?  I'm still going to have to try.  What's the worst that can happen?  You are where you are now, right?  Right.  And what do I have to do?  It's a numbers game.  What do I have to do?  Yeah, you ask enough penthouse pits.  You'll find the one with completely no self-esteem. 
[02:49:30]  All right.  There we go.  Oh, the leg wrapped around, Danny.  Wow.  And Danny's grinding a little.  Okay.  I keep doing the whole whatever it is, the move.  Does he grab, when you do that, does he grab your ass?  I think.  Oh, wow.  I'm treating this like a strip club rules where if I touch, I get my arms broken.  Ah, not in Montreal.  No, you grab her.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, you can grab.  Yeah.  I guess it wasn't.  All right, now she's moving around. 
[02:50:00]  You know what I like about it?  Both of you can do this into your righties.  Oh, she bent Danny over.  Oh, this is where Nora wants to go.  I don't think I would mind it this much if it was her.  And then this would be the final pose before I would push you down to the floor and we'd  get ready for the banquet scene.  Oh, it's a big fucking banquet scene.  Sweet, nourishing banquet, so much food, breasted women, trophies, rape. 
[02:50:30]  Nice legs on there, right, Danny?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Aw.  Danny got a kiss.  A grandma kiss.  Danny's got a grandma kiss.  Yeah.  Look at Danny's coming in as a favorite here.  All of a sudden, who would have known?  I have an Xbox and a PlayStation.  PlayStation 1, 2, and 3.  Just trying to rattle off everything.  Who would have known that girls like it when you're nice to them? 
[02:51:00]  For what, PlayStation?  Yeah.  I play Xbox way more than PlayStation.  Oh, yeah?  I play PlayStation more.  I like the graphics better.  Fuck that.  Well, it's debatable.  It's definitely debatable.  Why don't we debate it?  I like the sports games.  You don't have to choose between any of us.  You can have all of us.  I have.  Did I miss the dance?  We'll make it look like one of those.  Yeah, you missed the dance.  We'll make it look like a jar that you drip the candle wax on in camp.  Those things are awesome.  Do you remember?  Was the dance good? 
[02:51:30]  Yes.  Danny enjoyed the dance.  Let me tell you what I have.  Now, mind, there are 27 of us on stage at any given moment.  So, at any given moment, I'm either with a dude, with a chick, or in between.  That looks like a lot of fun.  Tuesday.  I get it.  So, you're going to come to the show tonight, I take it.  Jockey the squirrel.  I will come at the show, yes.  I will tell the girls to stay away from you.  The first three rows might get wet.  I'm like SeaWorld.  Well, actually, I was going to say, coming to our show is like SeaWorld. 
[02:52:00]  So, you hope you don't have a ponytail.  I have, this is my qualifications, I have an ex-wife, a wife, three daughters.  Seven dentists.  My wife, she's okay.  She was real.  Do you have a photo?  No.  Damn it.  Yeah, I do somewhere.  He's a dentist slash contractor.  Holy fuck.  A pulse drum.  See, Rich, you missed that.  I heard.  You did?  Okay, I wasn't sure.  I want to make sure you heard.  I've been nothing but nice and trying to get him late. 
[02:52:30]  I'm a good friend of yours.  I want to make sure you hear this stuff.  I would only tease you.  It's because I love him.  And that's not true.  All right, hold on.  Rich in Cleveland wants to comment on Voss's acting skills here.  This is very good.  Rich in Cleveland, yes.  And I can see it now.  Rich Voss in West Side Story.  La Bia.  I just met a girl.  La Bia.  La Bia.  And suddenly that name will never be the same to me. 
[02:53:00]  See, he knows the words.  He could have been an opera singer, but he blew out his voice.  Do you know that that song was the lyrics were written by Stephen Sondheim, and it was  the most time that any one lyric had been put into a song, the word Maria, over and over.  Leonard Bernstein didn't want that, but fuck Leonard Bernstein.  I'm like, I love Sondheim.  What's your favorite Sondheim musical?  Let's see.  Let's see how gay we are.  Really?  Yeah, I know everything.  I've only seen one Sondheim, and it's the amalgamation of four different fairy tales. 
[02:53:30]  Tales all into one.  I've forgotten the name of it.  Company of Follies.  Annie.  Annie.  Into the Woods?  Yeah, Into the Woods.  Into the Woods.  Into the Woods is my favorite.  I was like, what the fuck is it?  Don't get lost.  Next episode of Forensic Files.  Like, don't pick up any wooden nickels in the woods.  This is definitely an episode of Cold Case.  Yeah, Cold Case.  Why do they always meet in the basement?  Ten years later.  Yeah.  They don't have an office.  Detective pulls out a box of fucking shit from DNA. 
[02:54:00]  Yes.  And they didn't realize that the murderer left his driver's license at the scene.  These fucking idiot cops.  Are you going to close out with that one?  I'm entitled to one bomb a show.  It's called showing up.  Be more funny.  I'll take my one bomb.  Yeah.  You're just, you're one bomb, that's it?  That's all I had so far.  I'm due for another one.  They all want to fuck you.  I just want to hit you in the stomach.  Punch me in the baby maker. 
[02:54:30]  Fucking boss.  Matt Marseille said that to me.  Why, Rich?  It's just sitting there all open.  That's awfully mean, Rich.  What do you mean by that?  I don't know.  She looks very delicate.  I really think I can take her.  You went to musicals?  I just want to talk musicals with you.  I don't want to hit you.  Ask her a question, Jim Jeffery.  You can ask me a question.  Either way, talk about musicals.  What do you got?  What's your favorite musical?  Sound of Music, Julie Andrews.  Okay, that's not the name of the musical. 
[02:55:00]  That's the person who starred in the musical.  I know, but it's my favorite musical.  It's a good musical, isn't it?  What I like about it is all the Nazis.  I like the nuns.  People don't know there's Nazis in that.  Lots of Nazis.  That's a good musical.  The other day, I was on a flight from Newark to Frankfurt  to get to Glasgow for the Glasgow Festival,  and I sat next to this woman  who was an 80-year-old, 90-year-old German woman,  and she was so moody,  and all I could think was, 
[02:55:30]  I bet you she grassed up a few Jews in a day.  I probably did.  Yeah, like her dad was running a shop,  like going, oh, nothing's wrong,  and she's got to check behind the bookshelf.  She just looked moody.  You didn't ask?  No, it's a delicate subject to broach.  Not on radio, though.  Yeah, did you grass up a lot of Jews, darling?  Are you going to have the chicken or the beef?  So what did you have, the chicken or the beef? 
[02:56:00]  I had the lasagna, actually.  Oh, nice.  I remember, I had the fish.  Tuna?  I'm serious, me and you should go out.  Me and you would get along very well.  I'm a lot nicer off the radio.  Are you now?  Oh, so much nicer.  You really just are going for it, aren't you?  I think you'd enjoy going out with me.  I'm a very nice guy.  I can say no in several languages.  And I can say rape in one.  Ah, nice. 
[02:56:30]  Shut down like crazy today.  When you're stepping over his naked body,  who would you fuck out of these guys?  You said I was cute before.  I think I was cute, right?  No, you are cute,  and you're a very fun person.  I would love to get to know you as a friend,  but I don't really have...  Why am I not sexually attractive?  Do we need a mirror?  That should be the first thing you say every morning.  I don't think I have enough time to explain.  Is it the drug sweats? 
[02:57:00]  No, it's the boo sweats.  That's good.  As long as the boo sweats is killing out the drug sweats.  There's no...  You can get high by licking my cheek.  There's no one in this room that you would fuck.  Gotta be honest.  I don't always stink.  No one in this room?  Well, you guys are all taken,  and you don't have open relationships.  Unless your wife calls me and says,  Hey, I want to sleep with you.  Believe me, 
[02:57:30]  it costs me tons of money to not have a fucking wife.  The nearest thing I've got is Anthony.  Either way, like I said,  if I get a call from your significant other,  whoever that may be,  and she says it's okay  that you two have discussed it  and you have, you know,  an open relationship,  then it's on.  But otherwise, no,  you guys are off limits.  His girlfriend's not allowed to use the phone  without permission.  Nice.  I didn't think so.  Do you let her at home?  Huh?  Do you let her use it at home?  Did you just say I'm rubbing your glue?  I'm implying that I'm fucking your daughter. 
[02:58:00]  My daughter would have to be man in her pussy to fuck you.  I like how you dance around the subject.  Okay, which one?  The 17 or the 19-year-old?  No, no one.  No two.  I'm going to say the one that hasn't been born yet.  I guarantee if I was single and we met,  we'd go out.  Because I could tell.  I could tell.  I guarantee that she had a certain element of taste.  And I'm funny.  No, if you weren't seeing somebody,  I'm telling you,  because I used to bang girls like you all the time 
[02:58:30]  and never call.  I'm telling you.  Right on.  You know.  I would be more likely to leave your bed long  before you'd kick me out.  Huh?  And you wouldn't make it to my bed  after I shot in the car,  you'd get out.  Okay.  What I'm saying,  believe you me,  I'd open your car doors  when we're going around a turn.  Listen to me.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you,  because I know my confidence  and I know my rap.  I would close a deal with you.  I know it.  I might not fuck you,  but we'd go out.  Okay, fair enough.  I'm not confident,  but I am single.  That's awesome.  I don't think I'll close it, 
[02:59:00]  but I will sit in your garden.  I have a garden.  I have a stoop.  No, that's English for a backyard.  Yeah, I'll sit in your yard  for a long time.  I know that's awesome.  Yeah.  Hey, you'll learn to love me.  Over time, you will love me.  Yee!  What, am I going to learn to love you?  Like an old pair of shoes?  But he's probably right.  You get to know him a little bit.  Does it just feed you occasionally, 
[02:59:30]  pet your head,  you're good to go?  No, more like a hostage.  More like a McKinsey Phillips.  Oh, will you clean my floors?  Are you saying she'll love you  or develop Stockholm Syndrome?  Yeah.  I think I'm more likely  to develop Stockholm Syndrome.  I think our relationship  would be Stockholm Syndrome.  You know Morgan Murphy?  Yes, I know Morgan Murphy.  You know what she said  about McKinsey Phillips  when her father was talking?  We're talking into microphones.  We say it on mic, you idiot.  It's the best line on the planet.  Morgan Murphy said 
[03:00:00]  about McKinsey Phillips,  see, ladies,  you can wear them down  if you try hard enough.  Who's McKinsey Phillips?  She's an actress  on One Day's Time.  She's made accusations  that she had sex  with her father.  Morgan Murphy's joke was  McKinsey Phillips  had sex with her father  when she was 19.  See, ladies,  you can wear them down.  That was the way.  But the boss  just fucking bumbled through  and she said  that if you're good  and you get good grades.  Yeah, where are you?  I don't get it.  Have another sip there. 
[03:00:30]  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Fucking hell, man.  You get drunk.  I've been on this show  20 times.  This is the only time  I've been wasted.  Of course.  And it's like  you're playing it against me.  Never.  No, not at all.  Uh-oh, the victim.  They have to.  We should date.  No, we should not.  You're going out  with somebody?  Yes.  You have a boyfriend?  Yes, I do.  Oh, really?  I also have a girlfriend.  And what does your boyfriend do?  He's a singer, dancer, actor.  Gay.  Gay.  Unemployed.  That's gay, right?  Would you like to watch your boyfriend 
[03:01:00]  give head to another guy?  I mean, you're...  Whoa.  Would you like to see that?  Oh, yeah.  I'd like to be involved.  I would love to see my boyfriend  give head to another guy.  Because you're so...  You're bisexual, obviously.  But you wouldn't like to watch  your boyfriend?  No.  Why not?  Because that's not his thing.  He's straight.  Yeah, yeah.  He says he's straight.  No, it would not.  Because he's straight.  I fingered a gun in the asshole.  He fucking loved it.  What part of straight  are you not understanding?  That's disgusting. 
[03:01:30]  Think about it.  You're straight, too.  You want to fuck a girl.  You don't want to suck a dick.  Oh, well, guess again.  Yeah.  Oh, my bad.  What you just said,  Rich actually yells at himself  in the mirror.  You don't want to suck a dick.  Or do you?  My bad.  That's his man drop.  Holy shit.  No, I'm just saying  as a fantasy.  I'm just asking about  a woman's fantasy.  No, not even as a fantasy.  Guys always go,  I want to see two girls  get an eye.  Well, of course,  because it's sexy.  I also have a girlfriend.  I'd rather have a threesome  that involves a guy 
[03:02:00]  and a girl  because I like seeing  the cock going into her mouth  as I'm fucking her.  I've had threesomes  with two girls.  I prefer it  if there's another guy.  I just like seeing a girl  being degraded,  you know,  fucking pounded to shit.  Oh, degraded.  Oh, oh,  he stopped himself  before he said it.  I said degraded,  you slut.  No.  Jesus.  She's on Broadway  or in the Lower East Side.  That was a joke.  That was just for joke purposes.  I'm sure you're not. 
[03:02:30]  That was a joke.  Come on.  That's a little joke.  That was funny.  I've got a little accent.  Ooh.  And warts on your cock  and you wonder  why you can't have a date.  What have I done?  What's going to happen?  Hey, Jim,  show her the woman  you just banged recently.  Where's the picture?  We need two pages.  Yeah,  put those two pages  back together.  Which one?  Blonde or Bride?  That's his story.  She's good looking.  It'd be really sad for you  because it'd take her home. 
[03:03:00]  Who, her?  Mm-hmm.  If you needed a fucking mattress.  That means you'll get warts as well.  No, she's...  Oh, Jesus.  Yes.  See, the problem with this picture,  there's no newspaper  to see the date.  If you want to touch damaged goods,  go for your fucking life.  Oh, you were talking about yourself?  No, it was just too...  It was just too mean and real  and coming from a real place  and coming from a place of anger  and not fun.  Oh, look at Travis's baby.  I'm very nice. 
[03:03:30]  I'm sorry.  See that?  You don't want to do...  Oh, God, Rich,  just stop with the fucking...  I'm trying to show my baby's side.  Babies are cute  when they belong to other people.  Right.  Or if you smash their head  into a rock.  You know what?  I agree with that.  That's wonderful.  You don't want to do that.  Look, you got nice ribs  showing and everything, right?  She's super sexy.  Isn't that good?  Justine is super sexy.  Guys always go for ribs.  That's a big thing for us.  To get that figure,  how many laxatives a day 
[03:04:00]  do you guys do?  Just as many as you do.  No, I'm just saying,  are you eating disorders  or do you work out?  I work out.  How many teas?  Religiously, actually.  Because the worst is when...  That's why I called him lazy earlier.  The worst is when a bulimic  is blowing you,  you've got to time it perfect.  Why?  Well, you either come  or pick chunks out of your lap.  How much regret does it take  to have a body like that?  Take a look.  None.  It takes being a fat kid like you.  Oh!  See you two and a half. 
[03:04:30]  They're like...  I would have a comeback then,  but I just feel sad.  Well...  Drink the pain.  Fuck, man.  There really is none.  Drink the pain.  Listen to Mr. 24 fucking years over here.  Drink the pain.  All the insults.  Me and Rich Vosch's pounded fists.  I know.  Life looks better  through the bottom of a beer bottle,  doesn't it?  Anthony, I feel like  you're the only person on my team.  I am.  I'm singing.  I'm stating fact. 
[03:05:00]  Life does look better  through the bottom of a beer bottle.  It just does.  It's all magnified.  Oh, fuck.  Kind of hazy.  I'm being funny.  If you put it up next to  some girl's vagina,  that's really pretty.  It'd be awesome.  Then the beer can stay  on the night table  until I'm done.  Oh, fair enough.  Yeah.  You get to...  I mean,  deep face and pussy.  I mean, you're deep in it.  I just had Kimberly Kane yesterday  fucking just put her legs  so hard around the back of my head  that she literally smashed  my entire face 
[03:05:30]  into a pussy and ass.  I had a kebab yesterday.  It was great.  It was amazing.  Do you eat female ass, too?  Yeah.  You eat ass, female ass?  I'd toss a guy's salad  if it did something for him.  Really?  How do you make...  Rich, how do you make  these things sound so unsexy?  I know.  Literally, do you scrimshaw  as the same sexual fucking tension  as what you're asking?  Do you eat female ass?  I feel like I'm being questioned  by Walter Cronkite.  It's creepy.  It really is terrible.  I'm just wondering.  I've seen what... 
[03:06:00]  Senate hearings.  No, it really is fucking horrible.  Wait, what Senate hearings?  That's the sexual fucking nature  of his questions.  Asking your questions.  What do we got, two minutes?  Two minutes?  We got to plug everything.  Can you take clothes off now  because we've got two minutes.  I just want to see you naked.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize  they were supposed to get naked.  Yeah, please.  If you could.  Justine's play is Caligula  and it starts...  LaMama.org.  How do you spell it?  L-A-M-A-M-A?  That's correct.  And then don't forget  adultfriendfindernetworks.com 
[03:06:30]  and justinejolie.com.  Look at those nice little breasts.  They're like raisins.  I want to put cornflakes on your chest.  Stop ruining it for me, boss.  I'm like, why are they so mean?  Cornflakes?  Those are great.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing fishnet stockings  and I think it's actually caught a fish.  34C?  Do you pluck your hairs off your nipples  before the show?  That's really awesome.  No, I'm not like you, sweetie.  What the fuck?  I don't need to go get, like,  you know, waxed and stuffed man-o-lantern.  I'm only kidding.  You look good.  You look good.  I have so much thrush, 
[03:07:00]  it's unbelievable.  You might have the nicest ass I've seen.  Did I sponsor you as a kid?  No.  Wow.  But it's a good thing  I could take that dick  out of your ass earlier.  Oh, aha.  Dick in the ass.  Yeah.  I mean, you love dick so much.  No, I just...  I don't love it.  Didn't you just say  that you would love to suck cock?  Who wouldn't?  No, I don't want Rich Vos  sucking my cock.  No.  How am I going to get...  That I would love to see.  I'm going to rust that stomach  out of my head.  It's not the homosexuality,  it's just your fucking chompers.  That's my team. 
[03:07:30]  That's all friendfindernetworks.com.  lamama.org.  All right, everyone's got to get  the plugs in.  All right, why don't we  get the fuck out of here?  She's cute, a nice girl.  She's not cute, she's fantastic.  She's all right.  I mean, what the fuck?  Well, he's already got somebody else.  It doesn't matter.  I would eat your poo.  That's a good thing, Jim.  Hold on.  I'll make sure to save  a freshie for you.  It's not a good thing for you.  Wait, let me be sexy.  No, but it would be hilarious  to fucking watch.  I'm going to dig it out  with a knife.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, Jesus, what's that smell?  This is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show  on SiriusXM.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  My name is E-Rock,  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  The show will be back tomorrow  because we are off today  in observance of President's Day.  And we just wanted  to take the day off.  So we'll be back tomorrow.  We're doing listener requests,  worst of.  We're going back  to Facebook here  and finding what you wanted  to hear.  This is Joe Bradley.  He wants to hear the time  Celine Dion was on Larry King.  This is one of the first times  that we really got 
[03:08:30]  into Larry King  and the silliness  and just buffoonery  that Larry King  used to just ask people  as far as their questions.  This was around the time  Hurricane Katrina happened  and Celine was all upset  about people looting  and robbing  and all that stuff going on.  So here it is.  Celine Dion on Larry King  on Opie and Anthony  right now.  This is the worst  of the Opie and Anthony show  on Sirius XM.  You just reminded me  of something.  We didn't play the audio  of Celine Dion  on Larry King.  No, we didn't.  This was priceless.  She was very upset. 
[03:09:00]  Let's, we all understand  that it was a disaster  down there.  Mm-hmm.  But how could you not laugh  when Celine Dion  just breaks into song  on Larry King?  Because that's going  to help the victims.  That's what they need.  A song from Celine.  Ew, she sang?  Oh, my God.  This is really creepy.  It's deeply disturbing.  Yeah.  I understand everyone.  Even, even we have been affected  and we're trying to do our part  but God damn, man.  Some of these people  have got to relax.  Like Ben brought in  the picture of Sean Penn 
[03:09:30]  walking around New Orleans  with a shotgun.  A shotgun.  Here it is right here.  He's walking around  with a shotgun, I guess,  to protect himself  as he goes on  his rescue missions.  I don't know.  There's a lot of stories  about the shotgun.  Supposedly, he found it  laying around  and picked it up.  Oh, please.  Others say that  he brought it himself.  I was handing this  to the police.  Right.  Shithead, you got caught.  It's okay for you  to have a gun for protection  but nobody else, right?  Yeah.  His little scheme backfired. 
[03:10:00]  You know, this guy  brought his own photographer  down there  as he's rescuing people.  That's just,  that's just no good.  I thought he was  an asshole for many years  but it turns out  he really is  kind of just a weirdo.  Like, he's one of those  real weird guys.  Be more like your brother.  He's fat and jolly  and makes fun movies.  Looks like an alcoholic.  What a mess he is.  That's how I'm going to say  that word for now on.  Alcoholic. 
[03:10:30]  Alcoholic.  Maybe I'll get him on the show.  We have the same manager.  I'll talk to my manager.  Stop it.  And I have talked  to Chris Penn in the past.  I've never met him.  Oh, we did.  We did many years ago.  No, in person too.  I got a picture  with Chris Penn.  I want one.  I should bring in  all my old celebrity photos.  They're kind of funny.  Throw them up  on the website there.  All right, here we go.  Celine Dion.  We got to play this  a little bit here.  Celine.  A little bit.  Celine Dion and Larry King  last week.  I have to say, Larry,  that I'm as devastated 
[03:11:00]  as the rest of the world.  Devastated?  If I may,  I was watching you behind  with the,  there's a television right now.  I'm watching  and I'm especially waiting  like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  Yeah, through your  little pigeon neck.  She sounds like  Christopher Walken.  Oh, I can barely swallow it.  I can barely swallow it.  She's in one of those  ridiculous suites  in Las Vegas.  From my huge 
[03:11:30]  38-inch plasma television.  Right.  I could not  take the pain  and anguish  of those people  as I looked down  on Las Vegas  from my penthouse suite.  Why couldn't you  swallow the coffee?  Was her husband  using her mouth  to practice rolling Dyson?  Well, we've heard  he's got a problem.  What can I tell you?  We all have problems.  And I'm especially waiting  like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it. 
[03:12:00]  I come here  at Caesars Palace  every night  to perform.  I barely can sing.  Yeah, well.  But for respect  for the people who come,  I am still singing.  When I come home at night,  my son is waiting for me.  I watch television.  Yes, we gave a million dollars.  But what we expect,  what I want to look  like the rest of the world,  I open the television.  There's speed.  How do you open a television? 
[03:12:30]  I open the television.  Opie, I don't think  we should make fun of this.  She's still saying  while those people suffered,  she's brave.  She is brave.  She's a brave girl.  We gave a million dollar.  I have a coffee.  We, I don't know  what plural is.  Yeah.  How about buying an S,  you foreign whore?  I watch television.  Yes, we gave a million dollar.  But what we expect, 
[03:13:00]  what I want to look  like the rest of the world,  I open the television.  See, it was a dollar  and she just wrote  million on it.  Million dollar?  It was a million dollar.  And I open the television  and I see wires and tubes.  And I don't know  what year it is  because there's never tubes  in TVs anymore,  you idiot.  I open television.  What?  But what we expect,  what I want to look  like the rest of the world,  I open the television.  There's people still there  waiting to be rescued. 
[03:13:30]  And for me,  it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say  I'm being rude,  but I don't want to hear  those reasons.  You know,  some people...  They should fly her over,  fly her over  like the flooded areas  in a helicopter  and lower her down  and then she could sing  the Titanic song.  Wouldn't that be great?  As they're hanging  on to their roofs?  Hold on, Tyrone.  Tyrone, don't let go.  Don't ever let go, Tyrone. 
[03:14:00]  If only there was room enough  for you on that door  that your girlfriend  is on right now.  It could be a huge cavernous door  and there still wouldn't be room.  Have you seen the women down there?  Big fat asses.  You are a survivor.  Many people perished  under the brown sewage  of New Orleans.  Much like they did  that fateful night  in April of 19... 
[03:14:30]  18?  12?  14?  1912.  It was 12.  Shut up.  All right, sorry.  Much like they perished  in the icy waters  of the North Atlantic  on that fateful  maiden voyage  of the Titanic.  But some of them  were survivors.  And Larry, I watch. 
[03:15:00]  I watch and personally  I don't care.  But I cry.  I cry because my husband  is 90 fucking years old.  I cry when I think  he touched me  when I was 14.  and forced me  to marry him.  That is why  I weep today.  You think I really care 
[03:15:30]  about the shwoogies,  Larry?  How many bodies  lie there beneath  that mucky, brown,  stinky mess?  I say pee you, Larry.  Never let go.  And some of them  cling to their rooftops  like many clung  to life jackets  and pieces of wood  on that fateful night  on the Titanic. 
[03:16:00]  They are truly,  truly  Negroes.  They are so poor  and so black.  All right,  back to the audio.  All right,  back to the audio.  Jesus.  That was fantastic.  Stop it.  Back to Celine.  More crying, Celine.  And for me,  it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say  I'm being rude,  but I don't want to hear 
[03:16:30]  those reasons.  You know,  some people are stealing  and they're making  a big deal out of it.  Oh,  they're stealing 20 pair  of jeans  or they're stealing  television sets.  Who cares?  They're not going to go  too far with it.  Maybe those people  are so poor,  some of the people  who do that,  they're so poor,  they've never touched  anything in their lives.  Let them touch  those things for once.  Invite them into your house.  Let them touch.  You'll also have never  touched a seat  at your show  at Caesars,  you fucking overpriced  Canadian hosebag.  But you never touched 
[03:17:00]  an orchestra seat there,  did they?  Oh my God.  Let them touch stuff.  Let them just touch it.  That's the biggest  cock tease ever.  Here,  feel this plasma TV  that you'll never have.  How racist she is.  Holy shit.  Just touch it.  Just touch it  because that'll make  you feel better.  Unfortunately,  they were touching guns  at Walmarts  and touching the triggers.  Stop it.  I was inspired  when they taught  Coco to sign.  She did not say 
[03:17:30]  let the people touch.  Just touch it.  Just touch it.  Oh my goodness.  The people who do that,  they're so poor,  they've never touched  anything in their lives.  Let them touch  those things for once.  The main thing right now,  it's not the people  who are stealing.  It's the people  who are left there  and they're watching  helicopters flying  over their heads  and they're praying.  How come it's so easy  to send planes 
[03:18:00]  in a Naga country  to kill everyone  in a second  to destroy lives?  We need to serve  our country.  And for me  to serve our country  is to be there right now  to rescue the rest  of the people.  We need the cash,  we need the blood,  we need the support.  Right now,  we need the prayers.  Jesus,  where's Larry  through that whole  Jesus,  I was nodding off.  She has the foreign  policy inside  of a six-year-old.  How do we send bombs  to block the world  and the universe? 
[03:18:30]  In seconds.  In seconds.  Everything.  I can't get over  the fact  let them touch things.  Just touch it.  Much like  the poor passengers  that were stuck  in steerage  on the Titanic,  we should just  pull gates shut  and lock them  to drown  in their basements.  Look, Tyrone,  you'll never have an iPod,  but hey,  feel free to touch it.  I want to touch it.  Right.  Oh.  Oh, is that the best?  What a mess she is.  She continued 
[03:19:00]  on Larry King  last week.  It is,  you know,  when I was hearing  a couple of days ago  that these things  are not reachable,  it's too full of water,  maybe I'm too much like  I'm not thinking  with my head.  I'm talking  with my heart.  Nobody can open  any roofs.  The helicopter's  flying in.  Take two people  at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls.  Take a kayak?  A kayak.  Oh, she's an outdoorsy one.  Or take a limo  like I do 
[03:19:30]  to go to my shows.  Why can't they  take the flying  Steve car  and please  pick up these people.  Take a kayak.  Oh,  it is so easy  if Steve  would just,  there he is now,  just fly by Steve,  land and pick  these people up  in your flying  hybrid car.  The helicopter's  flying in.  Take two people  at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls. 
[03:20:00]  What?  There's  You can't take  a kayak  through walls.  Take a kayak  through those walls?  What does she say?  She watches  Gilligan's Island  too much.  You think that's  how they get around?  A kayak.  Jesus,  this isn't  I Dream of Jeannie.  Is Jim leaving  a permanent thing?  No.  Oh,  stop it.  Stop it.  He's still a big part  of the show  and he'll be  coming back and forth  and doing this  and doing that.  Don't you worry. 
[03:20:30]  There's  kids being raped  at night.  We hear gunshots.  Big guns.  What's that?  Those people are playing.  They're walking.  They're like this.  Hello?  Do you see us?  We're still alive.  But we're dying.  It's terrible.  I do not want to  talk to you about money.  What?  Holy crap.  Will you just  shut up and sing  your stupid song?  She lost her  fucking mind  and it's fantastic.  They can't  see them at night 
[03:21:00]  because they're dark  until they smile.  We see teeth.  We think they're  floating dentures  but there are people  attached to those.  Oh,  is she an ass?  Oh,  I thought somebody  dropped a big package  of ping pong balls  and I was looking  but it was humans  looking up at me.  I thought it was  ping pong balls  and chiclets  but it wasn't Larry.  it was people. 
[03:21:30]  Wow.  Wow,  wow,  wow.  Let's say  hi to Carl  in New Jersey.  Carl?  Hey,  she sounds like  Mr. Wet.  Do you remember  Mr. Wet?  Mr. Wet.  Yeah,  there was two  radio DJs  that had a show  back in the day.  I forget their names.  It was a big fat guy.  Hugh and Anthony  referenced them  all the time  once in a while  back in the day.  And she was like,  Mr. Wet,  I'm from the sewer.  I live under the ground.  Hey,  Mr. Wet.  never,  ever,  ever.  This guy  is amazing. 
[03:22:00]  Man,  I could have  saved,  I'm sorry,  Carl,  I really don't know  what you're talking  about.  All right,  let's continue.  Why are you taking  the birthday cake out?  Huh?  Oh,  okay.  All right,  more of Celine Dion  and Larry King.  Of course,  please.  I want this burnt  so I could listen  to it on the way home.  Of course.  We're going to have  Maury Povich in studio  in a few minutes as well,  so stay there.  Maury.  But first,  more Celine Dion.  This is too good.  Maury's going to have  to wait a few minutes. 
[03:22:30]  We've been doing  the show now  for two and a half hours.  We've been asking  a lot of people  how they can help,  how you can help.  A lot of people  all over the world  want to help.  You gave a million dollars.  You're going to help  a lot of people  live and survive.  You should take  great pride in that.  One,  that you've attained  the ability  to be able to do that,  to be able to give  a million dollars.  You should take pride  in that.  I understand it's very important  because eventually  we will need that money.  Of course.  But it's just very frustrating  that Franco 
[03:23:00]  and Conscious West  and me owe  one million dollars.  If this is one thing,  in three months,  in six months,  they will need that money.  Right now,  they're praying for water.  So we need to send them  the water.  They don't care  about my check.  No, they do.  It's just frustrating  because on our part  of the world,  we're trying our death  and we're expecting  those people.  Oh, she don't shut up.  I'm sorry.  And I'm sending  Welch's grape juice  and garlic. 
[03:23:30]  Old,  doddering old buffoon.  Yeah,  you know,  I love Larry King's style  where he pretty much  doesn't do anything  on his show  and lets the people talk  but sometimes,  as a host,  you gotta jump in there  a little bit.  My God,  is she upset?  Shut up.  All right,  here is the clip  of clips.  I know you gotta  go on soon  but we couldn't  spend any time  with you  without asking you,  do you have any  kind of thing  you would like to sing  that fits this moment?  He's got a song 
[03:24:00]  for everything.  Thanks, Larry.  He's got a song  for everything.  Is there any song  in your...  Even if you did  a little of it,  I don't want to...  Well,  the only song  that comes to my mind  right now  is definitely  a prayer.  What's going on  in Larry King's mind?  Do you think  he knows she's just  a lunatic  at this point  and is exploiting that?  Yeah.  Or is he dead serious  about having Celine Dion 
[03:24:30]  sing a song  for everybody?  I think he's just  trying to get  as much out of her  as he can  and at this point  having her do a song  is the icing.  You think so?  Is he being that calculating  or is he just  an out-of-touch ass?  That's what I'm wondering,  you know.  Sing a song.  The Motley Crue.  Because she's not  in the right frame of mind  to actually sing a song.  Let's see how this  plays out.  is definitely a prayer.  It's definitely a prayer.  I did sing that song  a few weeks,  a few years back 
[03:25:00]  with Andrea Bocelli.  Oh, yes.  And I cannot think,  I cannot think about a song  about a prayer.  I will do my very best  and  I'll do my best.  Generals  gather in their masses.

[03:28:30]  Wow  Wow  Wow  Wow  Wow  Wow  You're listening to the worst  The worst of the Opie and Anthony show  Right here  On Sirius XM  Worst of Opie and Anthony  My name is E-Rock  E-Rock Radio on Twitter  Follow me  Damn it  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony  Taking your listener requests  Since the show is off today  And I had no other idea  Of what to theme this damn thing with  Because they like themes around here  So we're going with listener requests here  If you went on our Facebook  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony  You can request shit  This one is Michelle Barton 
[03:29:00]  She requests  Diary of an unborn fetus  This is from I think 2005  This is an oldie  From the beginning of our satellite tenure  Where we found some audio of this guy  I guess you could call him a Christian  Performer  Christian comedian maybe  Used to do this voice  Of a character named Little Marky  And Marky would sing a song  About why his mom  Had to kill him  Surprise  He was aborted  I just spoiled everything 
[03:29:30]  But you know what  The bit is like 8 years old  Who gives a shit  You're listening to the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  On Sirius XM  October 2nd  Today my life began  My parents do not know it yet  I am as small as the pollen of a flower  But it is I already  I will be a boy  I will have blonde hair and blue eyes  Nearly everything is settled already 
[03:30:00]  October 19th  I have grown a little  But I am still too small  To do anything by myself  My mother does everything for me  Although she still does not know  That she is killing me under her heart  But I am a real person  Just as a crumb of bread  Is still real bread  My mother exists  And I do too  October 23rd  My mouth is just now beginning to open  Just think  In a year or so  I'll be laughing 
[03:30:30]  Or later I'll start to talk  My first word will be  Mama  October 23rd  Today my heart began to beat  It will beat softly  For the rest of my life  Never stopping  After many years  It will tire  And stop  And I shall die  November 2nd  Yeah  This is bullshit  First of all  There's no way to get a tape recorder in there  And second of all  How come he was talking  And then he says  My mouth is now opening 
[03:31:00]  This is crap  This is not real  I don't think this is a real recording  Of a fetus  It's called  The Diary of an Unborn Fetus  Oh  Dude a kid can't  There's no way for a kid to write  Got no pen in there  Come on  Today I saw a big hog  Come poke me in the head  Mommy's still having sex  This slut  I hear the sound of a vacuum cleaner  Mommy must be cleaning the rug  Wait a minute  It's headed this away  Oh no 
[03:31:30]  My little arm got sucked out  Jim Abbott  Here I come  My god man  Trying to share with everybody  Today I'm going on a ride  Suddenly the nourishment has stopped from mama  What looks like 
[03:32:00]  A fist came through the womb  Kind of like Freddy did in that original nightmare on Elm Street  When his face comes through the wall  Just he five knuckles  Can I continue  I am growing continually  My arms and legs are taking shape  But I must wait a long time  Before this tiny moon  To raise me to my mother's arms 
[03:32:30]  November 12th  Tiny fingers are beginning to form on my hands  How small they are  One day I'll stroke my mother's hair  And tell her how nice she is  November 20th  Only today the doctor told my mother that I'm living here under her heart  How happy she must be  Are you happy mother?  November 25th  Today mommy got told I'm a mongoloid  Mother was happy  But father kicked her down the stairs 
[03:33:00]  And said let's make sure this is mine you pig  And mother's parents are not happy  Because mother is white  But I am half black and half white  Mother's father in Do the Right Thing beat her  And threw her out of the house  For sleeping with Flipper  Are you insane? 
[03:33:30]  Mommy took thalidomide  I have arms like a seal  I'm in the womb only  And already I have thoughts of other men  I'm daddy's disappointment  I'm a woman trapped in a man's body  Who's still in a woman's body  Because I haven't been born yet  To humiliate my family 
[03:34:00]  With my transgendered nonsense  In 18 years  I'll be performing sex on someone  Who thinks I'm a girl  My mouth opened today  And in a few years  A luscious hog  Will slip between the lips  And my little fingers  Will clutch money  That's handed to me  And I'll leap out of the Saturn  Can I continue?  I'm sorry  Brought something to the program today  It's nice 
[03:34:30]  I like it  And you make a mockery of it  December 25th  Today is Thanksgiving  My mother and father  Are probably thinking about a name for me  And they don't even know  That I am a little boy  So they are probably calling me Barbara  But I want to be called Andy  December 24th  Funny every time 
[03:35:00]  I am growing so big  December 10th  My hair is growing  It is as bright and shiny as the sun  I wonder what kind of hair my mother has  December 13th  My eyes are almost fully developed  Although the lids are still shut  When mother brings me into the world  It will be full of sunshine  And overflowing with flowers  Unless my eyes don't work 
[03:35:30]  And I'm black  Then Jamie Foxx will play me  And annoy the whole country  Oh my god  March 2nd  Someone left me in Don Geronimo's driveway  That fat fuck backed over me  Oh my god 
[03:36:00]  Someday I will grow to be big and strong  And go swimming in Tommy Lee's pool  He'll be too busy giving hepatitis  To a supermodel to rescue me  Have the flu do you  Fucker  You weren't too sick to let a baby drown  Can I continue 
[03:36:30]  Yes  I don't know why the baby sounds like an old lady  When I do it  Let me tell you sonny  Really fast  Go to Chip  Hey Chip  Yes  What's up Chip  Not too much  Long time listener  First time caller  Who gives a shit  And I was just wondering  If this was more lost tapes  From Demented World  Are you trying to say  That I'm playing the part of the baby  You sounded a lot like yesterday  You motherfucker 
[03:37:00]  Soon I'm gonna be born  And live the rest of my life  In Ben's pants  I have never seen a flower you know  But more than anything  I want to see my mommy  How do you look mommy?  December 24th  I wonder if my mother hears the delicate beat of my heart  Some children are born with sickly hearts  And then the gentle fingers of the doctor 
[03:37:30]  Perform miracles to make them healthy  But my heart is healthy  It beats so evenly  Tup Tup  Tup Tup  You shall have a healthy son mother  And then one day I'll be born  And mama will bathe me and my four brothers  And drown all of us  I better get used to this water I'm in  I love my mommy 
[03:38:00]  Someday she's gonna get rich  By taking money from an androgynous pale hetophile  To poke me in my little pooper  I want to know what mama looks like  And have my little fingers crossed  That she doesn't drive an SUV  Someday she'll lovingly strap me in a car seat  And back us down a boat ramp  And then wave at me  And blame it on a jiggaboo  And all of this hard work will be for naught 
[03:38:30]  I'll wind up in Andrew Gore's living room in a jar  And I'll have to look at that freak  For the rest of my existence  That germaphobe who takes two hours to leave the house  December 28th  Today  My mother killed me 
[03:39:00]  That's terrific  That's terrific  Who the hell saw that coming?  And mother only killed me  Because I sound like Bobby  When Howie Mandel does him  Good 
[03:39:30]  Who the hell saw that coming?  Oh  Wow  Mother killed me  Now I will never cry on a plane  Or in a movie theater  And annoy everyone  You shall have a healthy son, mother  December 28th  Today  My mother killed me  Is that how it ends?  Oh, I know the point of this  Why  No, there's a song? 
[03:40:00]  Yeah  There's a Why Did My Mommy Kill Me song?  Yes  Too bad Mother didn't kill me  Before I thought of the lyrics  To this awful song  I gotta hear him say  My mommy killed me  Oh, you know?  I don't know where that was  Right behind it  No  Oh my god  Hopi  Going into the song is great  Oh boy  I went too far  Hopi  Oh boy  Alright  But my heart is healthy  Yeah  It beats so evenly  Tup, tup  Tup, tup 
[03:40:30]  You shall have a healthy son, mother  December 28th  Today  My mother killed me  Wow

[03:42:30]  Yeah  Alright, here's the song  End scene  Oh, God  Alright  Poor little guy  Here is the song  Why did you kill me? 
[03:43:00]  Why did you kill me?  When God made me special for you  I really wanted to see you  Stop whining  Stop whining  I'm per-  My little arms around you 
[03:43:30]  Shut up  Why did you kill me?  Mommy  Who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy?  Who is your daddy?  You really killed  For me  Stop whining  Stop whining  Stop whining  You're like this  I'm wondering  What I would have grown up to be  It's not a tumor 
[03:44:00]  It's not a tumor  I'll never know  Cause mommy  You killed me  Shut up  Quiet  Stop it  Stop whining  Yes, Eric  Did he say  My little arms are all goo?  I don't know  I'll have to listen 
[03:44:30]  Couldn't have said that  I'll have to listen on the replay  I don't know  What a number  Why did my mommy kill me?  Who saw that coming?  Wow  Except for us  How big is this girl's cunt  That a whole band can get in there  And play for this kid?  She had a box like the Titanic  Kids being sucked out  And the band plays on  You put your right arm in  And the vacuum sucks it out  Wow 
[03:45:00]  Thought he was going to be carried out  In his little take the baby home clothes  And you know  He's just in a plastic biohazard bag  He's laying next to a Reuben  Behind a building  Newspapers thrown on him  Little rats eating his fingers  Why did my mommy kill me?

Shit  600 million?  I hope not  I don't even have that on hand  I'm not liquid  Doug Forrester wants you 
[03:47:00]  To buy the stadium  I'm already broke  From that chemical spill earlier  My checks aren't long enough  How do you write that in?  You've got to spell really small  How do you add all those zeros?  Oh, that's great  Okay, I'll foot it  But can you not cash the check  Till next Wednesday?  I've got to make a deposit  What do you think  When you hear that on TV?  Are you thinking  It might cost me 10 bucks?  10 bucks maybe  At most 
[03:47:30]  100 dollars maybe  At most  At most  I'm not paying for anything  Till the Jets get a quarterback  And then they'll be able to  Make money off the stadium  Which will add to the economy  Which they never  They never put it that way  That stadium they wanted to build  Here in Manhattan  It would have been a nightmare  For commuters  And everything like that  But they wanted to  Build a stadium for the Jets  Here in Manhattan  It was a huge issue  In New York City  And the mayor wanted it done  Everyone  But the people that came out  Against it  They're like  You know how much 
[03:48:00]  This is going to cost?  This is money  That could be better spent  On education  And this that  Do you know how much money  In jobs  That would have created  Just to build the fucking thing?  It wasn't the cost  That I was against  It was the freaking traffic  Right  They were going to park in Jersey  And bring people over on boats  Yeah  They were going to have  A separate ferry  Like that  Just to bring people over  And there's a monster  Out there isn't there?

[04:02:30]  What is the cure  Who gets it  They're trying to  I don't know  Who gets it  I believe  Same people  That get the  The Hunter virus  Out there in Arizona  Like some Indians  They get it  But people  People do get it  Every year  People get the plague  But the way  They make it sound  They want it to sound  They want to conjure up  An image  That you're going to  Have to lower  The drawbridge  And send someone out  For some medicine  And hope they make it back  And the barbarians  Don't cut them down 
[04:03:00]  And root  They've got to put  Leeches on you  Yeah leeches  You'll be in the  You'll be in the bed  With the family all around  With that bowl of water  That they keep  Sitting there  Ringing out the  Ringing out the  Blood water  Put the leeches on you  The FDA actually  Just re-approved leeches  They're starting to  They're starting to use it  During surgery  For people  Getting hands  Reattached  It helps circulate  The blood  If you're going  To that doctor  We've got some leeches  I won't go to the  Leech doctor  We're going to back up

[04:05:00]  Is there a tasty  Harmful neurotoxin  That they had to go  Right for the deadly one  I'm starting to think  I should have paid more attention  I want the sour cream  And neurotoxin chips  Sour cream  And neurotoxin  Alright  Why don't we  Go on to the next  News tease here  Yes  Coming up next tonight  It's a secret  That some schools  Don't want you to know about  How safe is the college  That your kids are going to  College  College  How safe  It's a secret  Leave these parents alone  They're already bummed  That their kids are out of the house  Oh no

I don't know if anyone's  Noticed this  It's a little subtle  It's with the weather  A few years back  All of them were  Crowing about their  Doppler radar  Doppler's very big  On the news  Tells you what  Direction the  Wind's going  Rain  The weather  Doppler  Doppler  Doppler's all you heard about  Then they figured 
[04:08:30]  They had to put a number  After it  To make their Doppler  Because then all the  Station that Doppler  To make theirs better  Than the other guys  Yeah Doppler 4  So now Channel 4  Had the Doppler 4  And then they went  To 4,000  The Doppler 4,000  Then Channel 7  Said Doppler 7,000  Now the 7,000  Is 3,000  Better than the 4,000  So Channel 4  So now  I turned on CBS  The other day  I'm not kidding you  I thought it was a joke  They went to the  Doppler 2,000 
[04:09:00]  Dude  CBS weather  I started laughing  I'm like  They win  No one's gonna go  7,000,000  They have to go  7,000,000  They got so pissed off  That they just said  Make it  2,000,000  Doppler  Infinity  We win  They'll show like  A crazed supercomputer  With like the smoke  Coming out the top  Like the man in the cave  In the Twilight Zone episode  You can beat  Doppler Infinity though  How?  Doppler Infinity  Plus one 
[04:09:30]  Plus one  No backs  I was cracking up  They did not get the Doppler 2,000  CBS  Is now using  The Doppler 2,000  It was the Doppler  2,000  They still can't tell us  When it's gonna rain  No  It's the same  Believe me  It's the same Doppler  It's the same Doppler  It was when it was  The Doppler 2000  It's the same shit  Some fat engineer  In some stupid  Tiny little office  That I hear  Fred Doppler  Here's your machine  To hopefully get  The weather right  I don't know 
[04:10:00]  If this shit's gonna work  But give it a try  Give it a fancy name  Marketing  And we're all set to go  Doppler  Ah  Alright  We can't end  The News T segment  Without playing  Our favorite one of all time  Favorite one ever  And we got new listeners  Every day  So we gotta play it again  This is our favorite  Did any of the ones today  Beat the one  That we're about to play  I like the mice  The plague  Plague carrying  The plague's good  The lead is good  They were all very good  Which was the best one  You can tell a lot of time  Went by between us  Doing this bit  The plague was the best one  I like the plague  There's a lot of mystery  And the morgue
