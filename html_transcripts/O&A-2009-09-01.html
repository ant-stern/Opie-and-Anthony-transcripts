<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of the devastating Southern California wildfires, described as looking like a nuclear explosion.  The hosts contrasted the perceived nonchalance of some Californians with San Franciscans' reaction to earthquakes, sharing a humorous anecdote about earthquake sex.  They then speculated on potential disasters in New York City, criticizing the perceived incompetence of the city's government in handling emergencies.

A caller, "Race Kid," detailed horrific unsanitary conditions at a U.S. Open concession stand, lacking soap, paper towels, and reusing utensils.  This sparked a discussion about the general lack of hygiene in street food vendors, with graphic descriptions of hot dog and donut vendor practices.  Calls from Carl in California described the fire's impact,  while another listener discussed firefighting efforts.  A humorous anecdote about unharmed scuba divers found in a burnt forest was shared, followed by speculation about Serena Williams' physique and gender. A caller from Greece related a fabricated story about water-collecting planes accidentally scooping up swimmers.  The hosts introduced "axilism" (armpit sex) as the word of the day. Further calls highlighted unsanitary conditions in New York pizza places, including claims of sweat in dough and reused, dropped food.  A Los Angeles caller downplayed the fire's danger, while another suggested a conspiracy theory linking the fires to mortgage defaults.  The flammability of imported Australian trees was discussed, and a Rochester caller debunked the water-plane/scuba diver myth citing Mythbusters.  Dr. Steve briefly joined to discuss flu mortality rates, comparing them to the 1918 pandemic, leading to a debate about the impending swine flu season.  The show concluded with discussions of John Sterling's Yankee win celebration and A-Rod's weekly day off.

The next segment opened with a call from Nicole criticizing the show's lack of promotion.  This transitioned into discussions about Patrick Kennedy's embarrassing moment at Ted Kennedy's funeral, Boston Mayor Menino's upcoming debate (predicted to be a "train wreck"), and Elliot Spitzer's potential political comeback, drawing parallels to Ted Kennedy.  Crude jokes about Spitzer's prostitution scandal and the double standard between politicians and radio personalities were made.  Calls from Abe (mentioning a PSA with Mayor Menino and David Ortiz), Charlie (comparing Patrick Kennedy to a "Malcolm in the Middle" character), and Sean (commenting on Boston women's accents) followed.  Chris Brown's Larry King interview, where he claimed amnesia regarding assaulting Rihanna, prompted cynical commentary on celebrity behavior and justice.

A significant portion featured a pep talk from producer Sam, addressing the hosts' work ethic, rushed departures, listener interactions, and avoidance of management.  Sam highlighted the challenges of show preparation and the hosts' nonchalant attitude towards deadlines.  Sam's upcoming participation in "Fur Fright 09" led to humorous pressure to wear a costume, with suggestions ranging from a wolf to a prolapsed squirrel, and jokes about Sam's potential suicide methods.  Listener calls offered increasingly absurd and sexually explicit costume suggestions. The segment concluded with discussions of the Jay-Z/Rush Limbaugh feud and mispronunciations in hip-hop, incorporating vulgar and offensive language.

The following segment began with the hosts' observation that security system commercials always depict white perpetrators, prompting frustration and calls for diverse casting.  This extended to a critique of a survival show depicting plane hijackers as exclusively white Americans, speculating on the reasons behind this casting choice.  The conversation then shifted to the KFC Double Down sandwich.  A segment with producer Sam Roberts featured a humorous critique of Steve C.'s frayed denim vest, leading to a discussion on questionable fashion choices.  Guest Bobby Kelly joined, detailing a fly fishing trip, including techniques, equipment, and a near-drowning experience. The discussion touched on the ethics of hunting and fishing. Kelly also recounted problems with his damaged Vespa scooter and his interactions with the dealer.

The next segment focused on anecdotes of accidental damage, particularly involving vehicles and bicycles. Opie described hitting a motorcycle and leaving the scene, justifying it as a "human being" act. He also recounted running over a bike chained to a street sign. Anthony shared a story of his wife damaging a BMW.  Listeners shared their own hit-and-run stories.  A significant portion discussed Opie and Anthony's upcoming fly-fishing trip, devolving into a comedic exchange about attire, focusing on waders and mesh underwear.  Guest Bob Kelly, in studio, discussed his comedy tour with Dane Cook, including a show in Atlantic City, and his high electric bill due to his heated saltwater pool. The segment concluded with further fly-fishing trip discussion, a tangent about Gary Moody (repeatedly caught peering into outhouses), and a humorous news report about a bee-stinging reporter.

The final segment opened with a nonsensical exchange about a house fire, transitioning into a discussion of a disabled veteran's murder investigation in Oceanside (initially misidentified).  The hosts discussed the case of "Bobby the ghoul," whose backyard yielded a bone fragment, leading to suspicions of multiple prostitute killings. They detailed a prior case of a woman chained in Bobby's backyard in 2006, highlighting police inaction. This led to a discussion of true crime cases and their psychological effects, including Stockholm Syndrome (initially misidentified as Helsinki Syndrome), Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and the difficulty of keeping a captive.

The conversation then shifted to "Hoarders," with graphic descriptions of filth and unsanitary conditions, including feces, rotting food, and excessive Diet Coke. A firefighter called in, recounting a fire in a hoarder's house.  The hosts discussed the difference between hoarders and slobs. The caller mentioned a coworker who vomited into two-liter bottles.  A trucker shared a story about finding 17 gallons of urine in a semi-truck.  Further discussion revolved around "The Colony," focusing on its unrealistic portrayals.  A caller recounted a similar story about a classmate hiding vomit in two-liter bottles. The show ended with plugs for Robert Kelly's comedy shows, discussions of "True Blood," "Weeds," "Ghost Adventures," "Pawn Stars," "Antique Roadshow," other true crime shows, "Operation Repo" (dismissed as fake), "Deconstructed," "Deadliest Catch" (compared to "Swords"), and a final caller's story about Larry Allen allegedly using a Mercedes as a "spitter car."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  It's on the road.  It's on the road.  There it is.  Look, it just hit the pavement.  Hopefully we're not moving toward those fires.  Oh!  Fail!  They're calling the fires in L.A. an angry fire.  Grrr.  It's angry.  Grrr.  Oh, no stopping me.  That's the headline.  I'm mad.  Fire is angry.  Grrr.  Grrr. 
[00:00:30]  That's pretty fucked up out there, huh?  Yeah, Southern California is just burning again.  On fire.  But they said this one, what, grew in size twice the size yesterday alone.  Yeah.  Weather conditions are not good for the firefighters.  For the next few days.  No humidity.  High heat.  And a little breezy.  And stuff that should have burned years and years ago.  But because we're humans, we try to avoid nature from doing its thing. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Burning off.  And now nature's going, oh, yeah?  Now watch what I do.  I'm going to burn it all.  This fire's got a lot of fuel.  Yeah.  The smoke clouds from this fire are just amazing.  They look like a nuclear explosion.  They do, right?  They do.  They look like a big mushroom clouds with L.A. in the foreground.  There's a big mushroom cloud in the background.  It kind of does look like the apocalypse.  Unbelievable.  Or like a volcano.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A volcano. 
[00:01:30]  After like a mountain collapses.  That's part of being in California.  You've got the earthquakes and the big fires.  Well, the earthquakes.  That's pretty much that.  I was talking to people in San Francisco about earthquakes.  They're like, eh.  They're like when their dick is in someone's ass and the earth shakes.  Gives them a little extra leg.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't have to move as much.  They said it's no big deal.  Everyone else talks about it.  The place shakes, and if it shakes a little too long, you start thinking, maybe I should  get out of my house.  And then the shaking stops, and within seconds, business is back to normal. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Are those the people that were pancaked underneath that double-decker fucking highway, though?  Yeah, but that's one every 20 years or so.  You know, there's always that chance, though.  True.  It's like there's always that chance.  What do we have here, really, in New York City?  Terrorist attacks.  Very big.  That's a biggie.  Here in New York, of course.  That's a big fear factor thing that New Yorkers have.  And the blind governor.  The blind governor. 
[00:02:30]  That could cause some major problems for a lot of people.  Yeah.  Very irresponsible.  Bloomberg shutting down all the roads.  No, we don't like the occasional hurricane that makes it up to our area, but really, by that  time, it's shit.  The waters are too cold.  Yeah.  It slows down drastically.  It does.  It's just like, ah, I can't quite make it there.  They try to make it sound like, you know, New York lies on a fault line.  There's been some tremors. 
[00:03:00]  Just don't try to make it sound like it's going to be this giant San Francisco earthquake.  And then another thing they try to get us with is tornadoes.  Yeah.  National Weather Service is going to go into Jersey and check that out and see if a twister  did touch down.  Well, if they got to send somebody to see if a twister touched down, I want to see the  people in Oklahoma look and go, yeah.  Why don't you tell us about when a twister touches down?  You watch Discovery, it's going to be a flood. 
[00:03:30]  We're going to wake up one day and there's going to be 20 feet of water all around us  and we're not going to be able to get into our cars anymore or the subways.  Tsunami.  It's going to happen overnight.  Overnight.  It'll just, the water level will rise up and you'll see cabs sinking to the bottom of  the ocean.  And that'll be it.  Be on the roads.  Those fires out there.  And I was lucky enough to be in L.A., what, over the weekend and people just going about  their business and ignoring the fact that there's this massive smoke cloud in the distance 
[00:04:00]  and that the fire is creeping slowly but surely toward where they live.  Until it gets to you, who cares, right?  I think they're saying it's 12 miles from downtown L.A.  12 miles, that's far.  I mean, there's a lot of stuff that has to happen for it to actually hit downtown L.A.  I mean, that's obviously not going to happen.  But they're just going about their business with this just huge, ominous, nuclear explosion  type looking cloud in the distance. 
[00:04:30]  It's just amazing.  Yeah, they're working that thing.  They said it's just spreading in all directions.  It's out of control.  They don't know what the fuck to do with this one.  It might take out a lot of, what, towers out there?  A lot of TV and radio towers?  Yeah, Mount Wilson, apparently.  That's where all their towers are, radio and TV towers.  Well, it'll make an improvement in the radio world.  Yes.  Just get rid of all those crappy fucking radio stations.  The more fucking broadcast radio towers that burn, the better. 
[00:05:00]  The better for satellite radio, that's for sure.  Boy, they're not going to be able to get their twofers out.  Uh-oh.  Radio stations in L.A. won't be doing twofers.  And the TV stations, it's nothing to worry about either because most people have cable  or satellite, and that wouldn't be affected.  Well, they got the fire communications towers up there and all that.  Oh, really?  Well, like the rescue.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you need, fire communications?  Like, here's a fire.  Put it out. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, just...  Put some water on it.  Just put on your fire suit and follow the flames.  Put it out.  Get the plane to drop some water that looks like a little spit on a friggin' inferno.  So, it's like taking a water gun to a foundry.  Yeah.  A foundry, yeah.  That's like...  You see those planes and go, I understand they've been using them for years, and it  does do something, but every time I look at it, it goes, I look like...  It doesn't look like it's really doing anything.  Fuck the planes.  Did you see the new helicopters they're using?  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Where the whole, like, backside of it just opens up?  Yeah.  I haven't seen that before, I don't think.  This is the first fire I've seen that.  Then they've got, like, a huge DC-10 that holds just tons of water.  How much water?  The bottom opens up.  In a DC-10, you think?  Oh, my God.  I can't even remember how much water...  No, that's not even the helicopter I saw.  There's a new helicopter.  It's like...  It looks pretty much like a rectangle in the air, and the whole back of it just, like,  opens up.  Yeah, there's...  I saw that one with the DC-10.  It's just hysterical. 
[00:06:30]  And with the DC-10, what do they do?  Put just a couple gallons of fuel in it, and then the rest of it is water?  Is water.  Yeah, they must do that.  Because you can't fill up the plane with fuel and water at the same time.  Look at that thing.  Wow!  That's huge.  No shit!  And they put, like, flame retardant shit in there, and...  How many...  Or is it called flame mentally challenged now?  I'm not sure what the politically correct way to say it is.  Wow, how many scuba divers is that picking up?  Oh, but you know how many scuba divers you're finding just burnt up? 
[00:07:00]  Or actually not burnt, just perfectly fine in the middle of a burnt forest.  You don't know the story?  Of course.  Of course.  We're not burnt.  It's like, wow, we found scuba divers, and they weren't even touched by the flames.  Let me say hi to Carl in California.  Hey, you got a fire out here, Carl.  I hope Sam is proud with this.  I hope...  Hold on one second.  I just want to say I hope Sam is proud with the energy we're showing so early in the morning.  After his pep talk.  Yeah, he gave us a pep talk before the show today. 
[00:07:30]  Shut up.  Carl, what's going on?  Well, I could see flames before, but I just got smoke now, so I got nothing.  I'm just on the 63-wire, trying to tell you how the hills are burning.  Am I not understanding?  I thought it was English, but it just sounded like a bunch of words put together.  Yeah.  What?  No, it's Kiwi.  Oh, Kiwi. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And what's the point of your phone call?  Well, when I called earlier on, when I first got on the line, I could see flames on the  hills and that, but now I'm a little further around, and all I can see is just smoke.  Yeah, well...  But it's only a half, three in the morning, I still pitch black.  Oh, so you...  I had nothing.  All right, thank you.  It's very early.  He's probably drunk.  Oh, yeah.  It's early.  It's like 320 in California, so...  Yeah.  Anyway, so you got the fires, and they're calling it an angry fire.  Oh, angry.  Ooh. 
[00:08:30]  And we got this guy who's been on hold for over a half hour.  We've only been on the air five, ten minutes.  Wow.  Race Kid, what do you got?  Why are you on hold?  Well, I work for the concession food stand in the U.S. Open.  Oh.  And I want to just tell every listener, because I care about people, I know there's a lot  of New Yorkers out there, if you guys come to the U.S. Open, do not eat at any of the  food stands.  Eat something before you come, eat something after you get out. 
[00:09:00]  Now, why is that, sir?  Why is that?  The sanitation levels are awful.  I'm telling you, I've worked in food business my whole life, and I've never seen it as bad  as this.  What is wrong with...  Yeah, what's going on that's bad?  Give us some examples.  Are rats just bathing in the clam chowder?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Well, where can I start?  I work in a burger stand myself, and that's where I'm going to leave it, because I don't  want to get fired, because this is the only job I can get for the last eight months. 
[00:09:30]  That's noble.  Yeah, that's real smart.  That's real smart.  You want to make sure you still have a job, as you call a national radio show, to tell  everyone that the sanitation conditions are horrible at the U.S. Open.  Isn't it sanitary?  I'm doing this as a service advisory, an anonymous service advisory to your listeners.  I mean, to start with, we don't have paper towels anywhere to wipe our hands with when  we're done washing them. 
[00:10:00]  We didn't have any soap to clean any of the utensils with.  I mean, and this is just the tiniest tip of the iceberg.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Let's take this one step at a time.  What utensils, like what you're cooking with?  Absolutely.  Oh, okay.  We're cooking with what we're storing food in, hot dogs, hamburgers, and whatever other  station, you know, serves like the sausages and whatnot.  I mean, we didn't have a knife to open up the hamburger packets, so we were using, you 
[00:10:30]  know, the same spatula and tongs, you know, the hard edge on that, that you would use to  pick up fries and, you know, serve like a patty on.  Wow.  I mean, it's bad, and I mean, I'm not going to get into the politics of how this is being  run, but I really would not recommend any listener to eat at the U.S. Open.  I mean, I know it sounds like a philanderous thing, but it's, you know, it's honesty.  It just sounds like, you know, what you're saying. 
[00:11:00]  All right, Race Kid.  Take care, boys.  Don't grab one of them burgers.  You know what the fucked up thing is?  First of all, we have no idea.  Yeah, of course.  All right.  That's what Race Kid is saying today.  But let me also just say, it doesn't matter where you go.  I believe that's the way it is everywhere.  If you're going to San Gennaro or another one of these festivals or street fairs or any 
[00:11:30]  of these temporary kind of things like the U.S. Open and things that happen, events, you're  probably getting some of the worst sanitary conditions ever in what you're eating.  But that's the way it is.  You like your hot dog?  What do you think?  You buy a hot dog off the street here in New York?  Oh, my God.  You think that's sanitary?  Those friggin' savages are horrible.  They pick their nose, rub their pits, and then get your dog and throw it in a bun for  you.  You know, my favorite is those stupid fucking carts. 
[00:12:00]  Now, by the way, when I see them being towed across the bridge when I'm going home, I want  to smash them off the bridge.  Do you think those things, they really clean them up before they lay the bagels and donuts  out on those shelves after they've just driven about 20 miles with the things and got asbestos  brake dust all over it?  Puddles of street gack is splashing up into these things.  You think Hassan is there rubbing it down for your sanitary purpose? 
[00:12:30]  And don't forget the spit of the commuter.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, the commuter's behind these guys as they're going slow.  So you open up your window and yeah, yeah.  Huck and a loogie.  Huck and a loogie.  Right into their wares.  Everything.  They're on the street.  The friggin', the steam that comes out of the sewers.  All that shit settles somewhere.  Sure.  And it settles on those shelves where those little donuts are.  Let me tell you this.  I go to the U.S. Open one day every year.  I don't know if I'm going to make it this year. 
[00:13:00]  But the food is just terrific.  Is it?  For real.  See?  They have food from pretty much from around the world.  It's like going to Epcot.  You walk up to the vending area.  You don't know what flavor you want.  Do I go Italian, Mexican, Americana?  I think I'll have some sausage and peppers.  No, they're way past that.  Are they really?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Good stuff?  High class stuff?  High class, really good stuff.  This guy's just talking about burgers and hot dogs. 
[00:13:30]  I understand.  That's why I don't know.  I don't know.  That's what Race Kid is saying.  We don't need any problems from the U.S. Open.  We don't need any problems from the tennis center.  Showing it now on TV there.  Who was that monster hitting the ball back and forth?  Oh, my God.  Which one was that?  There is a picture of...  She's a monster.  Wendy Williams is a monster, and one of the Williams sisters is a monster.  Yeah.  That's a monster.  You know how they're talking about that African sprinter?  Yeah.  They're not sure if she's a man or a woman. 
[00:14:00]  Yep.  Have they ever tested that monster?  There it is.  That is Serena Williams.  She is on page three of the post today.  Yeah.  She's lifting her leg up, and I am seeing a leg there that just is...  I don't know how to describe it.  It's a man's leg.  It is a large man's leg.  I understand the women are getting nice and toned these days, but that's...  No, that... 
[00:14:30]  That's a man's leg.  That's a man's leg.  Has she been testing?  That'd be insulting, huh?  We should test her.  And there's Maria Sharapova.  Yeah.  She's looking all cute.  Oh, yeah.  And Roger Federer.  Let's go to John in Whitestone.  John.  Hey, Jay.  Good evening.  Good evening, John.  How are you?  I spent my summers growing up in Greece.  What part of Greece? 
[00:15:00]  What part?  What part?  Akata.  Oh, I don't know where that is.  That's all right.  Excellent.  A lot of ass sex?  A lot of tons of ass sex.  Ah, I know Greece has that rep.  Yeah.  So, since it's much like California, it's a dry tinderbox.  It fires all the time.  They'd have these airplanes that would dip into the ocean and very close to shore.  Or maybe a mile out to shore.  And every so often, they'd pick up an errant swimmer and just drop them on a fire.  And we'd see it here the next day. 
[00:15:30]  It was great.  I don't believe that has ever happened, by the way.  I do not.  I don't believe there's one case.  I bet that has never, ever happened, ever.  Because, first of all, an errant swimmer a mile offshore, that is pretty rare in itself.  And I'm sure they clear the path and make sure everything is good before a plane dips in there and picks up some water.  I would bet that it's never happened.  And to pick him up.  Right.  Backwards.  And also the part of Greece where I was. 
[00:16:00]  Never, ever, ever has happened.  What the fuck?  I don't think our listeners are getting oxygen today.  Are they all calling from L.A. in the mountains?  Yeah, it's very smoky.  Right.  They have wet rags over their faces.  I gotta get back to my ass sex.  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Thank you, John.  No one has ever been picked up.  I would bet that has never happened.  I defy you to show me one legitimate news story of a swimmer, a scuba diver, anybody being picked up by a plane gathering water to dump on a fire. 
[00:16:30]  Today's word, by the way, is axilism.  I applaud Brandon from Colorado.  I love the word axilism.  I don't love doing that.  I don't do that.  He writes, they do axilism with the hot dogs.  Axilism, for you people that don't know, is the act of having sex with an armpit.  With an armpit.  So I guess they take the hot dog and scrape him under there. 
[00:17:00]  The word of the day, axilism.  Let's see.  All right.  Let's say hi to Corey in Brooklyn.  Corey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  It's early, but, you know, Sam gave us a pep talk, so we're rocking.  It was good.  Thank God.  Let me tell you, fellas, I'm a cop over in Brooklyn, and I used to be in what they call a peddler squad,  and we used to take those filthy carts off of a street over here. 
[00:17:30]  And we used to have to clean them up before we brought them into custody.  You don't want to know the horror show of disease that we used to have to beg when we would clean those things up.  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  That's exactly what I was talking about.  Here in New York, every corner pretty much has one of these stupid fucking carts that people sell breakfast shit in and then lunch.  And they're filth ridden.  You know what, though?  The best hot dog you'll ever eat. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  You try to get a hot dog that tastes just as good as one of those vendor hot dogs.  You try it at a ballpark.  Try it at a restaurant.  Try it at Nathan's.  Yeah.  I don't know what the fuck they're doing, but those are the best hot dogs on earth.  Piss in the water.  It's sick.  I mean, even we had a building next to the precinct that in the morning you'd come in early because they'd store the carts next to the precinct.  Yeah.  And the garage door would just be up, you know, a quarter of an inch.  And the battalion of rats running back and forth because they knew those hot dog carts were in there was, it was like, it was disgusting. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And you go in and tell the guy, listen, clean the carts up and get the rats.  Because you'd go to a parking car to go to work in the morning and you'd be afraid your ankles would be missing because you'd get out of the car and you'd be swarmed by rats.  Because they're going after these hot dog carts.  And then roaches.  And it's, yeah, the hot dog ones, the donut ones.  Well, there you go, Ant.  That's what we got in New York.  They got the earthquakes and the fires.  We got fucking rats.  We got rats. 
[00:19:00]  They said there's more rats than people in Manhattan.  Oh, hell yeah.  Those donut carts, let me tell you, that's not lump sugar on those donuts.  I can tell you that.  That's what they call sweet lava.  All right.  But look, you guys, I'm punching out.  I appreciate you taking my call.  Thanks, I love the show.  Right on.  Thank you, Corey.  You know what I love on a cold winter day when the vendor who's selling whatever he's selling, his nose is dripping, just dripping mucus. 
[00:19:30]  What do you think he's doing?  Do you think he's wiping his nose and all the sanitary conditions are all in place and he's maybe using some Purell?  He is fucking just blowing snot rockets or the back of his hand or picking and wiping and then grabbing your food.  Donut?  You want a donut?  And you're getting some snot donut.  And you're getting some tasty food, though, my friend.  Oh, fantastic.  I used to work at a pizzeria back in the day. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  You know, those guys, they don't really wear gloves or anything.  No.  It gets pretty hot in a pizzeria.  Oh.  And I used to just sit there sometimes and watch as sweat would just drip off of the pizza maker's head into the dough as he just kneaded it.  Oh, God damn.  Of course.  Yeah.  And you know that's going to happen.  You sweat like a pig.  Yeah.  Oh.  And so not only is the sweat dripping off, like, the forehead and hair, but also, you know, you do wipe your brow at some point. 
[00:20:30]  So it's on your hands.  And you're continuing to make pizzas all day.  You're kneading the dough.  You're not excusing yourself to go wash your hands or anything.  Yeah.  We all know that stuff is happening.  You just try to ignore it.  You definitely just ignore it.  You just try to ignore it.  Yeah.  You know, people, you know, they don't even try to keep it clean.  No.  Because they just assume, everyone assumes their gunk is okay.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like, this is fine.  Like, I could pick my own nose and eat it right in front of everyone. 
[00:21:00]  No problem.  Ow.  But if I, like, had to eat Anthony's snot, I would fucking pass out from horror.  No offense, my friend.  You would have to go through a tissue, a battery of tissues, because I don't even look at my  own snot.  But that's what I'm saying, though.  Everyone's gunk, though.  You don't care about your own gunk.  It's when it's someone else's goopy shit.  That's when it becomes disturbing.  God.  Let's go back to L.A.  We're going to focus on L.A. today, because L.A. is burning. 
[00:21:30]  You've got an angry fire out there.  It's angry.  Oh, it's angry.  Jim, what do you got?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Good evening.  All right.  How far from the fire are you, Jim?  I could, where I work, I could look up Laurel Canyon Boulevard or up Victory Avenue, and  I can see smoke plumes in the distance.  There's actual smoke just burning, just fires everywhere.  And I just wanted to call and say, stop.  You guys have an international radio show. 
[00:22:00]  Let everybody know.  Stop calling me.  I don't, I'm not going to get caught on fire.  Are you okay?  I've been so worried.  I saw it on the news.  Are you all right?  Tell my mother to stop calling.  I live on concrete.  It's not going to catch fire.  It's not going to catch fire.  It's concrete.  It's fine.  Yeah, people are kind of picturing, like, people are picturing downtown L.A. just in flames.  It's just going to burst into flames. 
[00:22:30]  It happens every year.  It really does, yeah.  It's okay.  It just bursts into flames, and it's all in the mountains, and we live in the city.  So it's fine.  It's okay.  This one seems pretty fucking out of control, though.  I know, Jim, you yourself will be fine.  We're going to lose a lot of houses out there.  Houses, schmouses.  Yeah.  You want to live on the side of a mountain covered in brush?  Then brush fires will take down your house.  But if you live in an apartment in the middle of the city, everything's fine. 
[00:23:00]  There's no reason to be worried.  You see those people?  I can't believe it.  We've lost everything.  Yeah, well, look at where you built it.  Yeah, you wanted the nice view.  What do you want from me?  It's clear to me that Arnold Schwarzenegger does not care about white people.  I think that's what's going on.  Really?  He just doesn't care.  He thinks white people should be wiped out.  Because he's letting their houses burn to the ground.  It's an emergency.  Yeah, I heard him yesterday on the news.  Well, it's a real crisis.  You really thought Arnold Schwarzenegger knew what to do in a real crisis? 
[00:23:30]  I know.  You think he's that super action hero.  He has no idea.  Come on.  He doesn't know.  I thought he was going to get into a helicopter and bring your boy with him.  Get to the chopper.  How great would that be?  Aye.  Dylan.  Jesse Ventura.  Yeah, we'll put the fires out.  It's thermite paint.  Thermite paint.  Let's start the L.A. fires.  I know it was thermite paint.  Look at the paper trail.  Shut up.  We're on fire with thermite paint. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  But Jim, how many people have called you just because you live in the L.A. area?  My mother called me.  My brother called me.  My aunt called me.  I've had three calls.  And they're like, are you okay?  And I'm like, yeah, it's a little smoky out.  It's fine.  That used to happen when I lived in Capistrano and the river would kind of start overflowing  and shit.  I thought you were going to say the river would catch fire.  I'm like, God damn.  Yeah, the river would catch fire.  It was lava.  A river of lava would come through.  You know, you get the floods.  You get the floods? 
[00:24:30]  You get the floods.  You get those flash floods?  Is that a real thing?  Yeah, you get flash floods there.  No warning?  All of a sudden you're like, what the fuck?  It's not like a tidal wave, but all of a sudden the river will just start really rising  and moving faster really quickly.  So you get swept right off your feet.  You could be in two feet of water in some of those flood control canals out there.  It'll wipe you right on your ass.  You're just done.  And you're going down.  There's no getting out of it.  And then it just gets steeper and deeper and you're fucked. 
[00:25:00]  Wow.  You wash out to fucking Dana Point.  Yeah, sounds fun, man.  Have fun.  All right, Jim.  Hope you're okay.  Wake up, people.  Water down your apartment building so it doesn't burn.  I've been outside with the garden hose.  We love that visual, though.  The one guy that goes, I ain't leaving, and he's on his roof with his hose.  With a garden hose.  Hosing down his terracotta fucking shingled rooftop.  Unbelievable.  I like this Jim guy. 
[00:25:30]  Jim, call back any time.  He doesn't care.  We like talking to you.  There goes Jim.  Let's say hi.  I don't know where to go.  Damn, let's go to DJ in Georgia.  DJ.  Good evening.  Hey, you can ask Jim Jeffries about this.  I think one of the reasons why all those fires in L.A. last so long is because the rich people  import Australian trees that have flammable tar and sap inside of them.  Oh, yeah?  It's impossible to get those things out, man. 
[00:26:00]  How are you?  All right.  Let's go to Rochester, the home of Brother Weez.  It's Corey.  Corey, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, they had a myth buster about whether or not they could pick up one of those plants  and pick up a scuba diver in the ocean and drop him onto a fire.  Yeah.  They said it was bullshit.  They said that even if it was possible, you'd never find a body because they drop it in the  highest part of the fire.  It'd be incinerated and it'd be covered with ashes.  You'd never find it.  Plus, I mean, most scuba divers aren't near the surface. 
[00:26:30]  So, I mean, that makes the odds ridiculous, too.  You have to get a scuba diver that's just happening to start his dive or end his dive.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And aren't there, like, grates on the front of those things that the intakes?  Well, even a beginner dive, you're down 30 feet.  Yeah.  So, I mean, and Danny, you watch Mythbusters.  They did that one?  Yeah, I think it was a while ago.  So, they did do an episode where they tried to suck up a scuba diver, and it says here 
[00:27:00]  that it was busted.  The type of pumps used in firefighting helicopters cannot continue running once in the air.  As soon as the pump is shut off, any caught diver would simply drop back into the water.  The pumps also do not have enough suction to suck in a person in the first place.  Oh.  There you go.  Done and done.  Thank you, Corey.  Yeah, no problem.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Andy in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Good.  And then we got a lot of phone calls.  There's a conspiracy theory on the houses burning down. 
[00:27:30]  I think the banks have started the fire, so the only way they're going to get paid back  from all the default mortgages.  Ah.  That's a good one.  Really?  I doubt it.  California doesn't need any more problems, that's for sure.  And it's not like this hasn't happened before.  I mean, this happens all the time.  Yeah.  Uh, and now we got a ton of people calling from, uh, pizza places.  From pizza places and stuff.  Thanks, Danny.  Sweaty pizza.  Let me say hi to Matt in New York. 
[00:28:00]  Matt.  Hey, guys.  Uh, my problem is the people who pretend that, uh, washing their hands and using bare hands  and preparing your food is such a travesty when germs wash right off.  Instead, they wear a glove that traps everything, make my sandwich, take my dirty money that,  uh, you know, could have been on the floor, and then make the next guy's sandwich with  Yeah, I've seen that one.  They grab your hepatitis dollars, and then, uh, use the same, yeah, use the same fucking 
[00:28:30]  plastic glove to, to start making your sandwich.  Oh, what do you want from them?  New gloves every single time?  Yes.  That's not gonna happen.  New gloves every time.  All right, sir.  I'll bear a hand with a faucet's fine.  Right on.  Yeah, there you go.  All right, let's go to Todd.  Back in Rochester we go.  Todd.  Good evening.  Hey, Todd.  Hey, boys, not only the sweat and stuff, but I've mopped up some of the worst floors  I've ever seen in his pizza joints, and when we used to drop fried food on the floor, 
[00:29:00]  and it's like wings and crap and mozzarella sticks, I'll just throw it back in the fryer  for a second, and then we'll put it right back on the plate.  That'll disinfect it.  That was disgusting.  Yeah, but MythBusters should do that one.  I mean, if food falls on the floor, I know, what is it called?  The five-second rule?  That's bullshit.  I know that.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they did that.  But what I'm saying is if you work at a restaurant and, like, a mozzarella stick hits the floor,  now you throw it on the fryer or in the fryer, I imagine that burns everything. 
[00:29:30]  That would probably kill, you know.  That could be harmful to you, right?  Yeah, but, you know.  I would have to think so.  I mean, it's the hair and all that other shit.  You can still get a deep-fried pube in there.  Who the fuck wants that?  Thank you, sir.  John in Pittsburgh.  John.  Hey.  Yeah, there's a pizza place here.  The guy that used to run it, I believe, died already.  But he, which is a good sign, too, right?  But he wouldn't, his pizza, his hands would be covered in fucking flour. 
[00:30:00]  He'd go into the bathroom, do whatever he's doing, come back on hands, still covered in flour.  Oh.  And turn to the pizzas, some of the best shit around.  Except for the tip of his pointer finger and thumb.  Yeah.  That had no flour on it.  Do you want more of these?  He had flour, flour dick.  Let's say hi to Jimmy James in New Hampshire.  Jimmy James.  Hey, Mort, boys.  Hello, Jimmy. 
[00:30:30]  On the tree issue out in California, what it is is they're eucalyptus trees.  And what happened was during the housing boom, the pompous jackass residents didn't like how the trees looked.  So they shipped them in from Australia, and they are full of eucalyptus oil, which is used in lanterns.  So basically, every one of those trees is a giant wick.  Yeah, a lot of eucalyptus trees out there.  And those things will burn, huh?  Yeah, the oil.  Oh, yeah, they don't go out until they're gone. 
[00:31:00]  Wow.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  Yeah, I think this is...  All right, I'm going to hang up and listen to myself on the radio.  Oh.  Wow, that's an oldie.  What does this guy want?  Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Little Bill.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, one time I went to the fair down there at Jacksonville Stadium, and I got one of those sausage and pepper dogs, and about five minutes after I ate it, I started percolating.  And I said, oh, no.  So I went to the shithouse, and there was a long line there.  And by the time I finally just broke the line, I shit my pants. 
[00:31:30]  I had to leave my underwear in the stall.  Well, I rode with my friend and his wife, and I'm riding in the back of his car back home.  We had to go about 100 miles back home, and I could just smell the shit.  I know they had to smelt it.  Wow.  It was rotten.  Oh, man.  You got a good one, huh?  Yeah.  And there was a guy and his kid waiting to use the stall when I left, and when I was walking out, I heard the kid go, hey.  You shit your pants after a pepper and onion.  I left my shorts in there. 
[00:32:00]  Those things are evil, though, man.  Sausage, peppers, and onions.  Oh, yeah.  A little lime sauce.  But from a vendor.  God damn.  No, there's not too much goodness in there.  Thank you, Bill.  Say hi, boys.  All right.  We're all over the place.  Niagara Falls.  God, we could use Niagara Falls in L.A.  Mike, what do you got?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Mike.  Hey, they used to work at a mall in a little food court area.  A guy I worked with used to wash all the pots and pans in the back. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And they used to piss in the manager's coffee cup every night.  And every morning, that dude would come in and get a cup and just sit there and suck  on that thing.  And everybody just cringe looking at him.  World's wildest videos.  Employees gone wild.  Yeah.  Yeah, we haven't had one of those in a while.  No, we got pisses in the coffee pot.  Well, I like when they're bathing in the sinks.  Yeah.  That stuff is great.  All right. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Let's go to Ian in Orlando.  Ian.  Hey, what's up, you guys?  Hey.  You know what's even gross?  These places supposedly have gone green and no longer offer lids or straws, but still  get free refills and just scoop right with the cup.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  Same cup.  Scoop the ice.  I see it all the time.  I was fudging out there.  Yeah, because your lips have been on the rim of the cup.  And you're getting that ice.  Speaking of germs, the swine flu, that's going to take out a lot of people this coming fall 
[00:33:30]  and winter.  You think?  Oh, yeah.  People are speculating.  They're basically saying the regular flu takes out a lot of people, and the swine flu will  take out about twice as many.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  The numbers are going to be a bit up.  But one school, where is it, on Long Island?  Yeah.  They have a no-touching policy this coming year.  Oh.  They don't want the students touching each other.  Good luck there.  And they're hoping that will prevent the swine flu from spreading. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  So, they're saying 90,000 people across the country could die from the swine flu this season.  And how many die from the flu flu?  I honestly heard close to 40.  Yeah.  I don't know if that's true, though.  Maybe Dr. Steve or somebody else can help us out with that number.  So, because when you hear 90,000, you're like, holy shit.  A lot of people.  But the regular flu takes out a lot of people every year.  Yeah, mostly people with those pre-existing conditions. 
[00:34:30]  So.  Respiratory problems.  Yeah, but this school, hands off.  They don't want you touching each other.  Yeah, they said they know they can't enforce it.  Yeah, Glen Cove.  Community, yeah, okay.  Their school system.  They said they can't really enforce it.  Of course not.  But it's just kind of a way to raise awareness, they said.  And there's no real punishment.  They're just going to tell the kids, like, hey, you know, don't do that.  Just walk around fucking.  Just bend some girl over the lockers. 
[00:35:00]  And go to town.  Yeah, go to town and see what the teach says.  We got Bill in Brooklyn continuing with the unsanitary conditions out there.  Bill.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hello, Bill.  I'm a cop in Manhattan.  And there's a great stuff higher on 6th Avenue and 8th Street.  And a guy got stabbed in there.  And he got stabbed in the leg like a main artery.  And the blood was clotty and chunky and on the floor. 
[00:35:30]  And they took this guy out.  So they let the people in and they start serving the people.  So me and this other guy, we go, why don't you guys clean up before you let people in?  So they're like, oh, very sorry, very sorry.  And they go get a hose, start spraying the blood.  The mist is going all over the hot dogs.  And you hear it going on the grill going.  There's a little drop to hit on the grill.  Everybody used to eat at this place.  But after that, no more. 
[00:36:00]  Well, thanks for that.  Luncheon out.  Thank you, Bill.  Unbelievable.  Oh, come on.  I just read that.  You read that one.  Shane in Tennessee.  Shane.  Good evening.  Hey, Shane.  I used to hang out in this pizzeria joint up in Jersey.  And I swear to you, these two Irish bastards used to fuck the pizza dough before putting it in the oven.  Come on now.  I swear.  I watched them do it. 
[00:36:30]  You would watch them fucking pizza dough.  Why would you even watch that?  I'm calling shenanigans.  I swear to you, I didn't watch them do it all the time.  The guys pulled it out, said, watch this.  They fucked the dough.  And then continued to make pizza.  I kind of believe it, actually.  I have to call shenanigans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Oh.  How many people die from the flu every year across America? 
[00:37:00]  You're asking me statistics?  It's a flu.  That's an easy one.  Several.  Several.  Several.  Well, they're saying 90,000 people could die across America from the swine flu this season.  All right.  Well, let's go back to the worst flu pandemic that we know of, which was 1918.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  There were 1.5 billion people in the world back then. 
[00:37:30]  Looks like someone's computer just fired up.  Oh.  Mr. Google's on the phone.  This is what I've got in my head, but the next statistic, I've got to wait until Windows  boots.  But there was 1.5 billion people in the world back then, and a third of them got the flu.  And of those third of them, 10% of them died.  So you're talking 50 million people died.  Yeah, but that was, you know, them.  Okay.  That's right.  That's when you had rats for pets.  Yeah.  They didn't have, you know, they didn't even have the good newspapers back then to tell them 
[00:38:00]  that it was coming.  You know, that was part of it.  And so we didn't have the communication we have now.  They didn't have antiviral medications.  They didn't even have ventilators, you know.  Yeah.  So a lot of that probably wouldn't happen now.  We wouldn't see this decimation of, what is that, a third of a, or a tenth of a third  of the, what, shit, a third of the. 
[00:38:30]  You got the flu?  Looks like someone just woke up.  I mean, it was a big deal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we wouldn't see that this time.  But nobody, the thing that kills me about this whole sort of semi-panic that Fox News  and some of the other media outlets have done, because I watch them and they go, and they've  got this serious look on their face.  So, you know, the pandemic's coming back, and it could be like 1918, because this happened 
[00:39:00]  once before.  And, you know, that was one epidemic that we know about over hundreds of thousands of years.  But this, no one can predict what's going to happen with this.  This could be the worst.  This could be Captain Trips, or it could just be a bust, just like it was last time.  I mean, I feel very, it's very tragic for the people who died.  But this was a very mild case of injury the first time around. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, and they're trying to say that, well, you know, it could get crazy, so.  It could.  There's no question about it.  But there's nothing that we know of that's saying that it will.  You know, that's the thing.  No one can predict right now if this thing is going to turn bad.  But the only reason that it's in the news is because the CDC is trying to plan for the 
[00:40:00]  worst, which they, by God, should.  Yeah, what about vaccine?  Yeah, vaccine.  They're making them.  We won't have enough vaccine to vaccinate everybody.  But what about the important people like radio personalities and doctors?  That's right.  Well, health care providers.  Yeah, you're like first on the list.  We'll be first on the list because we're the ones that can spread it to everybody.  And then, what, kids and women and children first kind of a thing? 
[00:40:30]  God, men get fucked all the time on this.  Jesus Christ.  Give me the shot.  Give me the shot.  We won't have enough for everybody, but we may not need enough for everybody.  It's just like when you've got a forest fire, you don't have to mow down the whole forest  to put a stop to it.  What you do need to do, though, is cut a swath through the forest and do, you know, a fire break.  And if we can get enough people vaccinated so that we're not just spreading it exponentially 
[00:41:00]  through the population, you know, it would be enough.  That's called herd immunity.  And we just need to vaccinate enough people.  Right.  Talk to Steve.  Let me ask you something.  How long have you been awake?  Shut up.  Shut up.  No, yeah, you guys woke me up.  Yeah.  I'll admit it.  That's what time I usually get up.  Sleep would be great. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Sleep is wonderful.  No, you did fine for being woken up.  Dreaming and next thing you know you're on with, I don't know, a million people.  That's got to be a weird thing.  It is.  Hey, the labels came for the new wine.  Oh, God.  I can't wait.  I can't wait.  It's going to have a spot in my wine closet.  Yes.  Is it made out of swine flu, your wine?  Yeah, put some of the vaccine in there.  Sweaty rags from swine flu victims. 
[00:42:00]  What's the secret ingredient?  It's cyst juice.  Yeah, that's what it was, right?  That's our favorite, right.  Cyst juice.  Oh, boy.  You asshole.  Oh, yeah.  All right, Steve.  Thank you for your knowledge.  Okay.  Thank you, Dr. Sir.  Go back to bed.  Yeah, I think be concerned, but don't be panicking yet.  That's the whole thing with this.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you, doctor.  There he goes.  Dr. Steve's going back to bed. 
[00:42:30]  Like I said, don't be concerned yet.  Like, well, we might.  There's going to be problems with it.  That's for sure.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Break.  Break.  We got a Jay-Z versus Rush Limbaugh thing happening.  Who knew that hip-hop battle was going to hit the airwaves?  We got Chris Brown on Larry King.  What?  That should be good.  I wonder what inane questions he asks.  We did the school in Long Island fighting the swine flu by saying no touching, so we don't  need to really listen to a news story about that. 
[00:43:00]  I could not get the image of John Sterling shaking the Yankees win thing out of my head all night.  It just had me laughing that he looks like an utter and complete retard when he does this.  He looks ridiculous.  It's better than just watch it without the audio. 
[00:43:30]  He's such an ass.  If you want one with the audio, I can get it.  I thought he pounded his chest.  If you're here in New York and you know John Sterling does the Yankee calls on CBS.  Worst home run calls ever.  And I thought at the end when the Yankees win, he goes, the Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  I thought he did a little King Kong thing on his chest.  Apparently, he has an epileptic seizure, and that's what makes him go, oh, he shakes his 
[00:44:00]  fist.  What an ass.  And I guess that gets that, uh, going, uh, hey, your boy, Andy Pettit got fucked last  night.  Speaking of the Yankees out of a, uh, a perfect game, perfect game in the seventh inning.  And then, uh, and who, who, who took the night off every once in a while?  You know, the boys get a night off.  Was it a ride or Derek Jeter?  That was a red.  Uh, it was A-Rod.  A-Rod had a night off and his replacement.  An error.  I don't even know his name.  Gary Harrison Jr.  Thank you.  Yeah.  He, uh, he made a little oopsie. 
[00:44:30]  A little oops.  And Andy Pettit was like, oh, what the fuck?  That's all right.  Lost a perfect game in the.  Next perfect game.  A lot of people have had him in history.  What?  Like 18, I think?  Yeah.  18 in the history of baseball?  I'm sure next time A-Rod won't need a night off.  Yeah.  What the fuck is it with A-Rod?  Taking a night off.  What?  He gets a day off every week.  What?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  What is he, Howard?  I, uh, I'm very, very tired, uh, knocking home runs out of you.  Yeah, they think it makes him play better if he takes a day off every week. 
[00:45:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's all right.  That's great.  Okay.  Yeah, well, it made him play better.  Yeah.  This is great.  What an asshole.  Does he really get a day off?  I swear to God.  How does he swing?  How does a baseball player swing that?  Because in the beginning of the year, he wasn't, like, he wasn't performing well, so they said,  well, maybe he needs a day off here and there.  He is doing well.  Well, yeah, because aside from playing, he's psychologically just fucked up.  Yeah.  Like, he's, he's a weird dude, so he lets slumps get to him a lot more than other players? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  So they started giving him a day off, and then now it's an official thing.  Mm-hmm.  It's in his contract?  Like, he gets...  Yeah, it's not in his contract, but it's just, Gerardi gives him a day off.  Is it working out to be one a week?  Yeah.  No, it's, it's literally one day a week.  Let's see what happens in postseason.  Yeah, I'm sure he'll be fine.  Let's see if...  Yeah, I'm sure he'll be just like he always has.  All right.  Does he, um, I like how he spits his gun out and then smacks it with his hand at the 
[00:46:00]  end of the game.  Isn't that the coolest thing?  Ugh.  Big A-Rod fan, are you?  Oh.  Enjoy.  All right, we'll take our first break.  We've got lots to do today.  Opie and Anthony, and I think Bob Kelly's stopping in to say hi to him.  Bobby.  He'll be here in about an hour.  Bobby.  And Steve is wearing a fringed denim vest today.  No, he's not.  We'll get to that a little later.  Yeah.  Don't say yes.  The boys are very confused by Steve's fringed denim vest. 
[00:46:30]  Steve is very confused.  With no sleeves, by the way.  Why would there be sleeves?  That would be a little too hetero.  Hence, vest.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, watching CNN.  They're doing, you know, their coverage on the fires in L.A.  Yeah.  And they got a guy on the scene?  Yeah.  There's not a hint of a fire in the shot.  Why bother doing a live shot if you can't see the smoke or flames in the background? 
[00:47:00]  You've got to have the drama.  The drama's got to be behind you.  And their big graphic, fires surge towards L.A.  Yeah, it's going to take out some homes.  That's what fires do.  Yeah.  Is that what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know.  I'm reading the phones.  What happened?  Oh, you want this?  What is that?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  It's Nicole in Boston.  Borforston.  Borforston. 
[00:47:30]  Borforston.  Yes.  Nicole.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  Now that Boston doesn't have a rock station, what is everyone listening to up there?  Well, hopefully this fucking economy will turn around.  We can afford to listen to L.A. in the morning.  But it's pretty much shit.  You get to listen to Tudger and Rich talk about bullshit sports that the news talk about.  So you can't really get away from listening to the same thing all morning long.  Did they make them just do like a bunch of sports?  Yeah, I feel bad for those guys. 
[00:48:00]  I'm sure they have to go heavy on sports.  And, you know, they're better than that.  It's kind of unfortunate because they really were talented.  They were great in the afternoon.  And like you guys have mentioned before, there's tons of colleges around here.  So it was fairly retarded to get rid of that.  And now they have like that, you know, that station where it's like a Mike FM.  And then it's just like an iPod playing all day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  I mean, that's the brilliance of whatever.  Don't get me started.  Regular radio. 
[00:48:30]  I know.  Regular radio blew it a long time ago.  A long time ago.  And now their answer is to turn all their radio stations into jukeboxes or sports talk.  They think they can compete with.  If we were like in the middle of nowhere fucking Idaho, that would be one thing.  But in Boston, you would probably have a pretty good market.  You would think.  So it would be worth it here to keep BCN going.  But they know best.  Yeah, they sure do.  Hey, we're happy because it's just turning more people on to satellite radio. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, absolutely.  I've heard from a lot of old BCN listeners this was the thing.  They're like, all right, now I had to go out and get the satellite to listen to you guys.  For whatever reason before that, they were still kind of, you know, they were missing us and getting a peek here and there.  But now they're all in.  I really want to know how regular radio thinks they are competing against your own music that you can get from different services like, you know, Rhapsody or Pandora. 
[00:49:30]  Like, how do they think they can compete against your own iPod or your iPhone, which is an iPod at this point?  Like, why are they then playing these jukebox-type jockless shows on these stations when I could do it without the commercials?  Right.  Well, now it's very important to have personality radio.  But they never got that.  Nope.  Well, that's the thing.  In the morning, it was just a lot. 
[00:50:00]  It's a lot more interesting to get your news in the car because you're not, with traffic the way it is in Boston,  you're not fucking around in the morning watching the news before you go to work.  No.  You're not getting in the car and going.  So it just doesn't make sense on here.  It's just sports radio, if you give a shit or you get to listen to fucking Journey on Mike FM.  Ooh.  Look, I enjoy my sports, but I've never been a fan of sports radio.  It gets too ridiculous.  Yeah.  What they talk about. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, and you talk about shit that you don't care about.  Like, if they're talking about it while you're watching the game, that's one thing.  But I'm not visualizing in my head Tom Brady going back in the pocket.  Who gives a shit?  The game was three days ago.  And then they do imaginary trading and whatnot.  You think this guy would be a perfect fit for this team?  Well, you know, we've got to talk about who he's able to work with.  Shut up.  And it's always a trade that will never happen. 
[00:51:00]  And, oh, my God, it's just psychobabble.  Mike and the Mad Dog here in New York, when they were doing their thing, I enjoyed them  because they got away from sports and started talking about other things as well.  But when you get into such deep detail about a sports team, you'd just lose me.  Yeah.  You'd have to be like Bobo is about the Mets in order to listen to sports radio all the time.  Isn't that the truth?  Why are you calling, Nicole?  I see something about satellite that is bothering you.  I'm actually just calling because, first of all, Howard sucks, which we all know, 
[00:51:30]  so there's no point going down that path.  Hey, we're one big happy family now.  We're not allowed to comment on that.  Are you crazy?  You shut your yap there, young lady.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You can hit the dump button.  Al, we've got to get him back.  So I'm just calling because I'm listening to satellite, as I do every morning,  and they're promoting some doctor channel you can listen to,  but the ad tells you to turn to channel 114 right now. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, so it's kind of weird that it's not like today at 3, the doctor channel, 114.  They're actually promoting on your show to go to another station immediately.  Oh, that's wonderful.  At that moment, you should turn off the Opie and Anthony show and go to another channel.  Right, right.  Yeah, we've got our problems, too.  You know, we know that.  Yeah.  The thing is, you know, there may be a lot of people out there that think like, 
[00:52:30]  oh, O and A, it's fried jokes and hookah jokes and whatever.  And there's definitely a good share of them, and it's pretty funny,  but you guys are really intelligent.  You have a lot of interesting things to say.  There are tons of times when I'm listening to the show, I'll go home, talk to my husband,  hey, they brought something up that's interesting.  So it's a shame that you guys are kind of, you get pigeonholed into that toilet humor thing.  And I feel like maybe if they promoted you a little bit better, 
[00:53:00]  I wouldn't have to do it when I go to fucking cookouts in the summer.  Wow.  Come on.  It's embarrassing.  They don't realize.  You really need to listen.  Yeah, they don't realize what they got.  I'll be honest with you.  They really don't.  They don't understand what we could do for this company if they did the right thing,  if they held up their end of the bargain.  If you started promoting a way that we could get to the people that could actually make a difference,  I'm sure that they would get a lot of information from the listeners that they would be happy to hear, 
[00:53:30]  and it would probably help them to realize that they sort of have what they need right now.  You guys are on top of it.  And, you know, you're talking about topical things.  You both have great points of view.  Jimmy is fantastic.  And if they promoted you guys the way that you should, you'd be blowing Hallie out of the water.  Once we put her in charge.  Wow, Nicole, I could listen to you all morning.  Thank you.  Well, I hope you guys have a great day. 
[00:54:00]  You sound nice and fresh after your two-week vacation,  and I look forward to laughing my ass off today.  Hey, did you watch Patrick Kennedy at Ted Kennedy's funeral?  Oh, geez, that was kind of embarrassing.  Talking about his hazma.  Yeah, not only is that embarrassing,  but now they're talking about having Dukakis take Kennedy's feet in the interim.  What is that about?  Bringing him back up?  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  Back up from the minors?  Oh, you are kidding.  Okay, good.  That is right in line with making us seem more intelligent, 
[00:54:30]  the way that Boston seems when you listen to our mayor.  Boston.  Well, I hear he's going to be doing a debate on TV tomorrow night.  I can't wait to get that audio for the show.  Oh, yeah.  I watch the news every night, and whenever he's on,  I'm like, oh, this will be on O&A tomorrow, another fucking train wreck.  Yeah, we've got to get more Mayor Menino audio.  The debate is going to be great because they can't hide him.  He's got to be out there, you know, debating.  Yeah.  So it's going to be amazing stuff tomorrow night in Boston. 
[00:55:00]  That's going to be must-see TV.  I look forward to him speaking words that he really intends on saying three minutes later,  but he's getting so confused that he's just saying it all at once.  Yeah.  I cannot wait to hear this.  Oh, it's going to be great.  And speaking of the caucus, we got your beat on that one.  Elliot Spitzer is going to go back into politics.  That's what they're saying.  And you know what?  He's going to go back.  They're saying he's thinking about it.  No, he will go back into politics, and he's going to get something pretty impressive.  You watch.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Hell fucking yeah.  I don't know.  Look at Ted Kennedy.  He basically killed the woman, and it didn't slow him down.  That was the good old days.  I knew Elliot Spitzer.  You know, you sit out a year, a little more than a year, and then, yeah, he'll be back  in the game.  Yeah.  Who knew that when you killed a woman, all you had to do was come out and say, I'm  sorry, I'm an alcoholic.  And they're like, hello, right?  And then you keep your job for your entire life.  Right.  And us radio guys, we make one dumb Asian accent as we're trying to entertain people, and 
[00:56:00]  we're fired.  Yeah.  Yeah, that makes sense.  It's interesting what they think is the driving force in the world.  Like, you guys make an Asian joke, and fucking get the United Nations online.  This is a true problem.  Yeah.  But then we have friggin' politicians getting $4,000 hookers, and it's not a big deal.  Let's get them back in office.  Yeah, Elliot Spitzer will be back in some kind of office.  That'd be fun to see.  I guarantee it.  You want to make a little bet in it?  No, no.  I believe it.  It's definitely going to happen. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Thank you, Nicole.  It's been a pleasure.  All right.  Have a good day.  Let's talk to you soon.  All right.  Nicole, spreading the word up there in Boston for us.  Let's say hi to Abe in Cape Cod.  Abe.  Hey, how's it going, Tom?  Abe.  What's up, Abe?  Hey, I'll tell you what.  You were just talking about Menino.  He actually has a PSA with David Ortiz about playing safe in Boston this summer.  Oh, really?  Boston.  If you check it out on YouTube, it should be there. 
[00:57:00]  It's David Ortiz and Menino just going back and forth for 30 seconds, and you can't understand  the damn words.  Oh, my God.  We've got to hear that.  Either of them.  Yeah.  We've got to hear that one.  But the debate tomorrow night, Thursday's show should be really good.  I want to hear that.  Yeah.  We're going to have some great new Mayor Menino audio.  Thank you, Abe.  Yep.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Charlie.  Charlie.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Missed a little Jimmy.  Yeah.  He'll be back Monday, I believe.  Uh, yesterday with Ted Kennedy's kid talking about his asthma and stuff like that, you 
[00:57:30]  guys kept wondering who he sounded like.  Malcolm in the middle.  Remember his black friend?  Oh, yeah, in the wheelchair.  Yeah, he had a little of that.  He was always gasping.  There was also a young Harry Carey in the whole thing that came out after the bit yesterday.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Charlie.  And finally, Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey, Opie.  Hey, buddy.  I'd like to tell you, what did you learn and go with, no woman from Boston will ever have 
[00:58:00]  a sexy accent.  That was, when we moved to Boston to do radio, that was the one thing that was just really  tough to get used to.  Yeah.  These really hot women and their bizarre accents.  Goodness gracious.  And we're from Long Island.  Long Island has a horrendous accent, but the Boston one, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Is that a bad one?  All right.  I don't know where that one came from.  Hmm?  You trace that through history. 
[00:58:30]  Why did, why did they sound like that?  I don't know.  Jesus.  You want Chris Brown and Larry King?  Please.  We don't have, you know, it's, it's whatever.  Chris Brown, of course, with the Rihanna thing.  Yeah.  He, uh, finally was on Larry King.  Are they done?  Oh, yeah.  Like, they're done?  Oh, yeah.  I thought maybe they had hooked back up or something.  No, the law is watching, uh, Chris Brown now.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, yeah.  He says he doesn't even remember beating her or something?  All Rihanna has to do is go, you know, come on over. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  Uh, and then, you know, she could really screw him over.  Yeah.  Because even if they want to get back together, there's, there's laws in place, you know,  restraining orders.  Restraining orders?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  For years.  Years to come.  Chris Brown and Larry King last night.  When you hear about all the things that the police and the reports say you did, how do  you react to that?  I don't, I got to just look at it and like, wow, like, I'm in shock because, first of all,  that's not who I am as a person and that's not who I pride myself on being. 
[00:59:30]  So, I just, when I look at, like, the police reports or I hear about the police reports,  I don't know, I don't know what, what to think.  I just don't know what to think.  It's just like, wow.  You remember doing it?  No.  Don't remember doing it?  I don't, I don't, it's like, it's crazy to me.  I'm like, wow.  He's a liar.  Shut up.  He doesn't remember doing it.  He's trying to save his career there.  Yeah, you know something?  You remember.  You remember when you're smashing your chick in the face. 
[01:00:00]  I think that would kind of stand out unless you did it so often that, let me think, who  is that?  Stop it.  Of course.  And he sounded like he was really confident in his lie.  Yeah.  I would say it's crazy.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm not.  And we got Jay-Z.  Jay-Z and Rush Limbaugh have a little beef, according to Sam, Sam Roberts.  I had no idea this was going on.  I guess. 
[01:00:30]  Who's mad at who?  Who started it?  I guess Jay-Z went after Rush a little bit.  Here comes Sam.  Is this an East Coast, West Coast thing?  Let's say, Sam?  Yeah?  East Coast, West Coast, this whole.  How's the show so far?  You gave us a pep talk right before the show today.  Yeah.  You guys have been doing really good today.  The energy's way up.  Thank you.  And the audience is loving this.  Thank you.  Wow.  Thank you.  Great, Sam.  Thanks.  What did you hear us saying right before the show that disturbed you to the point you had  to give us a pep talk? 
[01:01:00]  Well, the problem was it was 6.02 a.m. and you both said, man, I can't wait until 10.30.  Yes.  I do recall us saying that.  When you hadn't even started the show, and you said, man, I can't wait until 10.30 so  we can get the expletive out of here.  I think it's, you know, well, the vacation schedule, Sam, has been very difficult to recuperate  from.  We're still trying to get back into the rhythm of this. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, I know.  I've still got a little jet lag.  I'm not trying to discredit any of that, but I just think that the best way to go into  a show is to go in with a different type of energy.  You know what I mean?  You heard us right out of the box, though, man.  We did well.  Oh, you did really well.  Yeah.  But we actually said that.  What else did we say?  You said, and then you said, you know, that you should still be on vacation.  Right.  And then what did Obi say maybe about starting the show?  Oh, right.  Of course. 
[01:02:00]  You said that you said, first of all, you both pointed out that I was trying to give  you a pep talk when it was already 6.02, which would be two minutes after the quote-unquote  start time of the show.  You then said, as I was talking, you know, my plan is to get us to the point where we  can start at 6.20 and then end at 10.30.  Right.  Well, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  And then as, I guess, time would go on, you'd do less and less and just have me and E-Rock  introing bits for the first hour.  That's how it goes.  Exactly.  Next thing you know, Opie and Anthony are actually Sam and E-Rock.  No one knows the difference.  At least till just, you know, a couple of weeks after vacations.  Right.  Because this vacation thing, like I was saying before, I got home probably around noon yesterday  and I slept until 5.30 in the afternoon. 
[01:03:00]  So then I get up, I watch TV, I do things, and then I realize it's 2.30 in the morning,  I'm still awake.  See, maybe you should work on changing your sleep schedule and go to sleep and stay up  all day and then go to sleep around 5.30 p.m. and that way you can come to the show with  that rested energy.  See, you know what the problem is there though, Sam?  Having a life.  Okay.  See, I usually, if I don't sleep, I can go out, I can do things, I can have a life, but 
[01:03:30]  I'm so completely exhausted that I would be like that interview on Larry King.  I'd be like, I don't remember, I don't know what happened, I think I beat her, wow.  I wouldn't remember.  But now, I sleep, and now I can wake up and kind of have a nightlife where I just, I pretty  much sleep after work, and then I nap before work.  Yeah.  It's pretty much what it's turned out to be.  That makes sense.  But it leaves me really sleepy when I wake up.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I think, maybe start thinking, I don't have a nightlife, but you know what 
[01:04:00]  my life is?  The show.  Oh, really?  That's what I do.  Remember being that old?  Yeah, fast forward 15 years, and you'll be sitting just like we are, stare at these tired,  miserable faces.  This will happen to you too.  Remember being a fresh-faced youngster like that, Opie?  Oh, it was cute.  Oh, coming in and going, you know, radio, it's just my life.  I, you know.  Enjoy your passion.  Yeah.  And your motivation, Sam, because this world will get you too. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  I just feel like if maybe we as a show put out more positive energy, that's what will  come back to us.  Oh, really?  You know what I mean?  You know what happens?  The more positive energy and goodness for the show and dedication you put out, the more  shit management will pile on top of you.  Is that what they're doing?  Yeah.  Sam, let me go back in time.  We, uh, we used to do a little show for a little station called W.A.A.M.  Oh.  We would get off the air at 7, and then the show prepping for the next show would start 
[01:05:00]  immediately.  Wow.  At 7.01.  Anthony was known to still be at the station around 10 o'clock at night.  10 o'clock.  Recording spots.  Three hours after the show ended.  Now.  Recording commercial spots.  That's right.  For the station, because you know what I did?  What?  I didn't just voice these things.  I produced.  I had to pretty much write them.  They gave me an idea.  They gave me an idea of what they wanted for a commercial and said, here, Anthony, go  to town.  I'd been in radio a whopping, oh, six months. 
[01:05:30]  And, uh, they wanted me to do voices.  And then I was tracking, like, doing eight-track recordings with tape.  Yeah.  One track at a time, my friend.  Tape.  I would have to put the, use the four-track and bounce that to the eight-track.  It was an abomination.  The creativity was off.  Oh, my God.  And 10 o'clock, I would be going, well, it's 10 o'clock at night.  I'd been there for, like, longer than a real job. 
[01:06:00]  Well, you certainly would get there before the show, too.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  That's long gone.  How long?  Like 20 minutes?  I would get there.  20 minutes?  Oh, my God.  That would be late, my friend.  The show started.  Hours before the show.  If the show started at 3, you'd damn well know we were in there by 1.30.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Prepping, recording bits.  Sam, fast forward 15 years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What time do we show up and what time do we leave now?  Oh, well, I mean, you guys will kind of get the rundown on what's going on around quarter to six on a good day, you know. 
[01:06:30]  Sometimes we're running a little late.  You'll get in, you know, five to six, say.  But, you know, we prepare the show.  I mean, look, I prepare the one sheet every day.  That's actually.  What?  That's like me, Danny, and Travis.  Oh, really?  To do that stuff.  What, you just hand this to us?  Yeah, kind of like that.  I just want to, in our defense here, we are like off-duty cops. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Never really off-duty.  That's what I think, because you know what?  I'm show prepping when I'm home just watching television.  Because I'll do, I'll give you guys some audio or something or some prep, and I'll think to myself, I wonder what these guys are going to do with this today.  And that's your magic.  That's our magic.  Do you actually see us throwing your work in the garbage?  Yeah, I do.  Well, yeah, I see it in the can.  Yeah.  Because you guys leave so quickly, I don't get to see anything. 
[01:07:30]  And what time do we leave, Sam?  All right.  Let's say the show ended right now.  Okay, so what time is it?  It's about 7.30?  Yeah.  So if the show ended at 7.30 on the dot, you guys would be down in the lobby.  We're on the 36th floor, so you guys would be down in the lobby by 7, 31, and 30 seconds.  There's actually been times when people from down the hall, management, have come in to talk to you about the show, and they'll come in and see an empty studio and look at me and be like, no way, where did they go? 
[01:08:00]  I didn't even know the show was over.  They're gone.  I noticed.  I'm glad you brought this up, Sam, because there's a new thing that happens.  I saw it happen yesterday, and I saw it just before vacation.  When we say, like, all right, we're out of here, Ron and Fezz are next or whatnot, I actually see, most of the hardcore listeners know we have this very long hallway that we can see all the way to the other side of the building. 
[01:08:30]  As soon as we say, all right, we'll see you guys tomorrow, I actually see a sea of people running toward the studio, hoping they could get here before we make the left turn toward the elevator bank.  It's like a race.  It's a well-known fact around here that if you want to speak to Opie and Anthony, you must be outside the studio door before the show ends.  If you're there one minute after the show ends, you will not see the stars.  I will admit to doing this. 
[01:09:00]  I have finished the last break of the show as I'm packing my bag of relief.  It has been on my chair.  I am packing it and speaking into the microphone.  Our favorite move is to make believe we're going to be back after the break.  That really confuses the management around here.  That's always happening.  They come in here.  There they go.  They come in here, and they're like, wait, is the show done?  And those guys leave?  It is the constant battle to try not to speak to management. 
[01:09:30]  That's what we think of you assholes down the hall.  Deal with it.  Yes, Dan.  But that's not fair, because then we have to deal with that.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, that's what you guys do.  Some people say...  That's your magic.  Some people say, but all the promotion, like the sales promotions and stuff, Opie and Anthony  must go to sales meetings, not realizing that Opie and Anthony are represented by Sam and  Danny at sales meetings.  Yes.  You are our representative.  Well, you sort of know how we think, so that's good enough. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  You go in our stead.  We have staff meetings that don't include Opie nor Anthony.  Yes.  Exactly.  Yes.  But after 15 years, don't you think we deserve this?  I think you deserve it.  His emails and to Twitters sometimes makes things a little more...  By the way, good news for you.  I don't know.  What?  Tomorrow, I'm bringing in razor blades, pills, and a noose.  Tomorrow's the day.  I don't need any of those three things. 
[01:10:30]  All you have to do is choose which way you want to kill yourself on the air live.  Or figure out a way to use them all three at the same time.  Oh, wow.  Well, you could use them all three at the same time, definitely.  See, if I brought in a gun, that's highly illegal.  But if I happen to have some pills, if I happen to have like a noose, it doesn't look like a noose.  It's just a piece of rope.  Because that's a hate crime.  And then we also have some razor blades, I think.  Well, I don't know.  Razor blades are dangerous.  Again, this is...  I'm hoping you go with the razor blades.  Why? 
[01:11:00]  Because you bleed out and we'll get a lot of air.  It's very graphic.  A lot of air time with you, Sam, before you pass out.  I'm not going to commit suicide.  I'm going for the big sleep.  I'm not killing myself.  The big sleep?  You're going for the big sleep for us, aren't you?  I have no reason to commit suicide.  I mean, things are going all right.  How's the costume for the costume for Fur Fright?  I almost forgot.  We got an update on Sam's costume.  Yes.  Yes.  What do you mean Danny has a costume?  I have an update.  I was contacted by a boy who is going to be attending Fur Fright 09. 
[01:11:30]  He has an extra costume for Sam.  Did you say costume?  Oh, I'm sorry.  He has an extra costume for Sam.  I'm not wearing a used furry costume.  And he has no problem lending it to you, buddy.  No, there's...  I bet it smells great.  Better dry clean the jizz out of it.  I think it's of a wolf, so you get to be a scary wolf.  Ooh.  I don't...  With the genitals cut out.  Remember.  Remember.  And your hiney hole.  And your hiney hole.  For easy access.  The costume isn't even in...  Costume.  Costume. 
[01:12:00]  ...development.  I haven't given it one bit of thought.  No?  Because it's just not anything that occurs to me naturally.  You said you would do this.  We have to get into their world.  You're like a...  You said I would do this.  You're a reporter.  A representative.  You're like Mike Wallace.  I am a reporter.  You're going to knock on some doors.  And let them knock on yours.  You're a representative of the Opie and Anthony show.  Have some pride.  I have to wear the uniform, I guess.  Yeah.  So wear the uniform.  I hope the listeners are keeping track, but I do believe we're 45 days away from Fur Fright  09. 
[01:12:30]  I mean, maybe we kind of...  45 days.  And it's in Connecticut.  It's perfect.  Come on.  It's local.  You've got to go.  Yeah.  One of those two-week vacations again.  Maybe we forget about some...  Nope.  No vacation for a while.  Yeah.  I'm game for that.  If you get swinging, it's good.  Come on.  Are we happy about the show?  We're happy we get to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Of course.  Okay.  I look forward to it every morning when that alarm goes off.  Good.  I just bolt up out of bed and go, yay! 
[01:13:00]  You get to jump up and say, today I get to be Anthony Cumia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what I say every morning?  I wake up and go, showtime.  Yes.  Great.  Yeah.  It's showtime.  That's how we pull this off.  Because the show starts like the second my eyes open.  Exactly.  I'll look at something and just go, that'd be funny for the show.  You know, whatever it is.  Well, that's what makes you guys special.  Sometimes you see things and think of it in a different, funny way than other people. 
[01:13:30]  Thank God we have eight TVs, because I didn't even know what was going on in the news today.  I woke up.  I went, oh, the fire is angry in L.A.  I could do a couple minutes on that.  Lots of papers and CDs.  Oh, really?  News articles sent overnight.  Wow.  Wow.  I mean, we tried.  I did kind of get out of the habit of looking at the news during vacation.  Vacation really fucks with the show.  I used to be a paper guy, no matter where I was on vacation.  I honestly, I think I read maybe one paper over the break. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  The placemat, right?  The placemat in the restaurant.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Yeah.  So thanks for the pep talk today.  Yeah, it helped.  I think it really helped.  I'm glad.  As long as it helps you guys and helps the show.  Maybe we can start recording the pep talk for everyone, because it was terrific this morning.  I mean, if that's what people want.  Yeah, you know, so then it was very good this morning.  I like, though, that it was very spontaneous.  You go and listen to the first few minutes of the show.  You can't tell that we're miserable. 
[01:14:30]  Well, I would hope you're not miserable.  That's the ultimate goal.  I talked to Anthony twice during break.  One was to say, hey, how's it going?  A little, hey, how's your vacation?  And then what was the last one?  What was the last text I sent you?  I might even still have it.  I think it was about, let me.  I honestly might have it.  It's worth reading for everybody today.  Was it business oriented?  Hell fucking no. 
[01:15:00]  Well, you guys were, you deserve a vacation.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Kind of just decompress from anything work related.  Yeah, let me see what I can find.  Yeah.  Even though you had Bobo at your house.  Yeah.  Naked.  Thanks, Keith, the cop.  Jesus.  Let me see.  All right.  Oh, shoot.  I erased it, I think.  Oh.  Do you still have it on yours?  No.  No.  Hmm.  Let me see.  Do you remember what it was?  It was basically bummed out, I was bummed out that vacation was just about over. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I do remember the, and I said something like, only two days before we have to deal with those  assholes again.  Yeah.  What did you mean?  Not odd.  Like management and stuff.  Yeah, sure.  Whoever wants to throw themselves into the asshole ring.  Keep myself outside.  No.  Just staring over at that dolt with the glasses 10 feet away from the computer monitor.  I don't even know what he's doing.  It's Clemson to Kenny.  Clemson to Kenny. 
[01:16:00]  He is sitting at that computer.  His face, I swear, is four feet away from the screen.  Look at how short the chair is.  His arm is reaching up.  He's reaching up.  He's got his glasses on, and he's just staring at the monitor like someone who doesn't know  what they're looking at.  Yeah.  It's like new technology to you.  Why do you sit so far from the monitor?  I'm reading English.  But I understand.  What are you looking at on the computer right now?  Wow. 
[01:16:30]  What are you looking at?  Four feet away.  Yeah.  What are you looking at?  I was reading an email.  Oh, okay.  Very important.  Business related?  Personal.  What are you doing?  You're hooking up?  No, no.  I'm a happily married man for over 25 years.  Sorry.  Yeah.  I'm sorry about that.  You hook up all you want.  Oh, no, no.  No.  What?  Use like the internet to hook up?  That's crazy, Kenny.  Wow, that's weird.  What's wrong with you?  Who does that in the future? 
[01:17:00]  No, you're a single guy.  You should enjoy your life.  Yeah.  Kenny, what time do we leave?  Leave after the show, you mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Give a normal day.  The show's over.  Let's say it.  All right.  It's right here.  All right.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Let the listeners know what happens.  You're in the elevator within nine seconds of ending the show.  Is it true people chase us down the hall because they need answers?  Yeah, well, we're running away from them. 
[01:17:30]  Sometimes management will squeeze into the elevator and take the elevator right down to the lobby because they need to talk to us.  And just to make sure that there's no leeway time, not only does that pack up during the last couple minutes of the show,  but before the show ends, one book neck strap is on the shoulder.  Yes, yes.  I'm actually ready to leave the door.  I've gotten this phone call in my vehicle.  Uh, Anthony?  Yeah, what's up? 
[01:18:00]  Where are you?  Oh, I'm on 49th.  You know, I'm just, yeah, I'm headed.  You know, we had a meeting today.  Uh, we came down like right after the show ended.  Right after.  Oh, see, that's the problem.  Yeah, I had to get, I really had to get out of there.  I saw four suits running through the studio yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Did you see that?  And you would think that would, that would be a sign to us that, oh, wait, maybe they need to talk.  Maybe something's up.  Yeah, we got to talk.  Yeah, but that just meant let's get out of here faster. 
[01:18:30]  Out.  You guys can't be faulted because you're better at time management than them.  That's true.  If you listen to the show and it sounds like Opie and Anthony start talking very fast at the end of the show,  it's because there's management at the end of the hallway.  I've gotten downstairs faster than Hans Gruber got downstairs at Nakatomi.  It's just time to leave.  Yeah, there you go.  I think we're going to start doing our last break from our cell phones. 
[01:19:00]  Why don't we just do that?  Yeah.  You're going to go to your car and you're going to tell people that you can't be interrupted while the show is on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then the last break, you're already going to be out of the building.  Out of the building.  Okay.  So that we know, literally, unless you're here, well, you can't be bothered before the show because you're getting in the zone.  No, no.  I love.  There's not much time.  No time at all.  Zero.  I love the listeners that are still holding out hope that we're going to go to 11 again.  11?  What are you, nuts?  Shit, that's OT. 
[01:19:30]  You did a long show yesterday.  We sure did.  Yeah, we did.  That was our first day back from vacation.  Yeah, that was a mistake.  That was a mistake.  We didn't want to set a precedent.  Right.  Yeah.  So today, we can make up for it, right?  Well, yeah.  They all like a little time, so don't expect us past 10, 15 today.  It's like balancing a checkbook.  Yeah, you know, Sam.  You make deposits, you make withdrawals.  Yesterday, we deposited some time.  That's right.  Now we get it back.  Now we can withdraw a little.  I thought it was just like, bonus time meant like it was a bonus, not like we're going to 
[01:20:00]  take this away from you tomorrow.  You know when that stopped?  When we stopped getting bonuses.  That's right.  For things like Christmas.  Yeah, they don't believe in bonuses.  No.  Actually, I don't know.  Incentives.  Maybe giving you a little more money year after year.  Yeah, things like that.  Strong argument.  Yeah, same salary for three straight years.  If that makes sense, that's going to motivate us.  Yep.  How do you know we're even live right now, Sam?  Well, I mean. 
[01:20:30]  How do you know we're not home sleeping?  That is true.  As the people listen to this.  We could be home.  And this is all just acting.  Yeah.  We could have recorded this yesterday.  That's right.  But it would have required you to be here after the show.  Would it have?  Really?  Unless.  Who has recording equipment at home?  That's true.  See?  I know someone.  Could have done that.  Well, we're hoping that Ted Kennedy is going to pull out of this one, but we're not really  sure.  Well, no.  Huh?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  It's not looking good for Ted Kennedy.  Yeah.  And I want Tiger Woods to win the Barclays this Sunday.  Oh, yeah?  The Barclays?  The Barclays?  This Sunday?  That would mean that Ted Kennedy is already dead.  Leave it to Kenny.  The Barclays.  The Barclays.  Yeah, you know that golf tournament in Jersey City?  Right.  Yes.  Yeah, it's going to be a big one.  That's a fine golf course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  A lot of people really do want to know, Sam, what your costume is. 
[01:21:30]  Well, I don't have a plan.  I don't.  Let's say hi to John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey.  Yeah.  How are you guys doing today?  Hey.  What's up, John?  I know how Sam would have been upset if he would have missed, you know, being able to  wear a costume to his little convention there.  I wouldn't have been upset at all.  I don't want to go.  You should.  You have to go.  You got to do your what's the haps.  Yeah.  As you're being pounded in the ass by the law.  No.  I'm not like someone in a costume.  The back of that costume is getting cut out. 
[01:22:00]  I mean, the most I'll do is maybe go interview people, but there won't be any gay sex.  Your bunghole, your bare bung is going to be exposed.  No, it's not.  Yes.  It'll be reinforced.  Hey, has Sam given any thought to how he's going to kill himself for the show yet?  No.  Well, tomorrow I'm bringing in razor blades, a rope to make a noose, and some pills.  Come up with some kind of Rube Goldberg thing that makes it happen all at once. 
[01:22:30]  Like you knock over some dominoes, and the next thing you're dead.  Yeah.  No, I don't have any reason to kill myself.  We do.  Why?  I mean, well, that wouldn't be fun if you have a reason.  So you just want to just for an exciting...  You're doing it for the show, yeah.  Give you a pep talk.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I guess depending on the pep talk, but I really don't see myself doing that.  I don't understand why you wouldn't just run really fast toward one of these windows.  Because then I'd break the window and fall out and die.  That would be cool.  Yeah, just give us a warning so we get some mics near the window. 
[01:23:00]  It's probably going to be a long time coming.  I just don't see myself killing myself, committing suicide anytime soon.  Never know.  People suggesting you go as Goldust to...  In sixth...  Or to Furry Fright.  Oh, I'm going to have to bring in some pictures.  Furry Fright 09.  In sixth or seventh grade, I don't remember which one, I dressed up as Goldust.  Just...  Get out.  Full outfit.  Just...  Just...  Full outfit.  My mom made it.  Because I was a big Goldust fan. 
[01:23:30]  Your mom made it?  I had a robe, too.  I had a full body suit and gold face paint and a wig, and I spray painted boots gold.  And I wore that outfit to Maston Square Garden in 1996.  True story.  And what did people do?  Were you beaten to a pulp?  No, I was working with my dad, and they asked if, you know, if his daughter wanted anything  to drink, or if his daughter was going to...  Because they...  Oh, really?  And I was his son.  I was a boy then.  Did they think he was the Iron Sheik with his mustache? 
[01:24:00]  Did they ask your dad about time travel?  A curly mustache.  He does have a curly mustache.  Does he still have it after all this abuse we give him?  Of course he does.  He loves it.  He takes pride in it.  Yeah.  A little wax.  He's still...  Every morning?  He doesn't really need to wax it at this point in his life, because there's been so many  years of waxing.  It's trained.  Yeah.  Sam, we got one of your fans on the line.  Very, very good news.  Oh, it's actually Coke Logic.  Coke Logic.  A fan of Sam. 
[01:24:30]  Yes.  Good evening.  Hey, Coke.  Yes, I am a fan of Sam, but I think we could do two words with one stone.  Oh, two words with one stone.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You still there?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, that's rough.  Hell yeah.  You had a chance to step back on the gas there.  He goes, he was really hoping that there would just be a dial tone at that point.  Yes, we're still here at Coke Logic.  I was really hoping you guys cut me off to spare me there. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I think Sam should be fucked to death.  What?  For the show.  Fucked to death.  At Furry Fright 09.  In his costume.  I couldn't have less interest in that, in doing that.  I couldn't want to do that any less.  But he's a fan of yours.  I mean...  No, I mean...  Bob in D.C.  Bob.  Okay, so this is going to require a contribution from both O and A.  Okay.  Anthony will bring in the firearm.  And Opie, you need to bring in the assisted handgun suicide device from that movie Shooter 
[01:25:30]  with Mark Wahlberg.  Sure, right.  And we strap up Sam into it, and that way he can't back out at the last minute.  This sounds like murder, though.  This sounds like forcing me to commit suicide.  It is a little bit of murder.  No, it's assisted suicide.  It's assisted suicide, Sam.  Homicide.  Assisted suicide is not, like, legal or anything like that.  In Oregon, it is.  We're not in Oregon.  Well, for the sake of argument.  Okay, for the sake of argument.  You know what would be great... 
[01:26:00]  The first take of the show, Sam, it's going to improve morale.  It's going to improve morale.  You know what, he's right.  You're all about improving morale.  Why don't you take the first step?  I mean...  Yeah.  Lead by example, Sam.  I don't know what that'll do for my morale.  It's a problem.  You know what I say we do?  We'll make it about you.  We get you a one-way flight to L.A.  Okay.  And you just slowly start walking toward the fires.  Oh, yeah.  Dramatically.  I mean, I'll go to L.A.  Dramatically.  Burn yourself alive. 
[01:26:30]  It can't hurt.  And make sure the reporters know you're doing it for the O and A show.  And then just dramatically start walking toward the fires.  Like, just wear an open Anthony shirt.  And God damn, when that big, huge Afro of yours...  Oh, man.  When that thing catches, you're done.  That catches fire.  I don't see myself doing that either, really.  But it's great.  It's a big news story.  Everyone is focused on the fires.  God, that would help.  Fires.  Your suicide.  With an O and A mention.  I feel like we run the risk of some reporters taking a negative spin on it.  It's the only thing.  Hmm. 
[01:27:00]  Not really.  Like, shock jocks can be produced.  We've learned over the years, any publicity is good publicity.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, you guys are the pros.  Oof.  Are there any of the new interns that are standing out?  I know we have a couple new interns.  Well, we've only met one new intern so far.  He's only started.  We interviewed a bunch, so they'll be starting.  Okay.  Do they know how much of an asshole you are yet?  None of the interns think I'm an asshole.  They think I'm a teacher, mentor, maybe role model. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Some idol or deity, but no asshole.  So, is the new one good?  Well, he was good in the sense that he was making fun of Swivel Hips Evan yesterday.  Oh, okay.  He had the sense to not take any of Evan's advice.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Very good.  Very wise.  I mean, that's potential.  That's a lot of potential.  And that would be a Graham?  Graham, yeah.  Or as Kenny so cleverly started calling him, Graham Crackers. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, no.  That's hysterical.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I saw him walking around with a giant name tag.  Front end back.  Now it isn't even a name tag anymore.  They are full sheets of paper that they just write in Black Magic Marker their name and put  it on the front end back.  We should force the interns to dress in furry costumes for their entire interview.  Internship.  I support that.  With the buttocks cut out.  That I'll support.  Yeah.  There's just something about their ass being cut out that really makes it. 
[01:28:30]  With their genitals hanging out.  Let's say hi to John in North Carolina.  John?  Hey, Jim.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I think Sam should be dressed up as an orangutan with a big red ass.  Well, you know what?  You can...  That's not a bad idea, Sam.  Before you get into the costume with the ass cut out, the orangutan costume, drag your  ass all over the rough carpet so it gets very red and tender.  I can...  And then when you put it on, it'll look like a mandrill ass, like a real baboon ass. 
[01:29:00]  What about just a suit with like a fake...  Nah.  You can see the fake...  The fake ass.  That's been done a million times.  That'll be good.  Like, you should be prolapsed, too, where your asshole is falling out.  Right.  I don't know.  It just seems...  What about this?  Constipate yourself in force.  What about this one, Sam?  We line up people that have the swine flu and they cough in your face.  No, it's a terrible one.  I'll definitely get swine flu.  Wow.  Yeah.  But then we see how healthy you really are. 
[01:29:30]  Well, I mean, I'm pretty healthy, but once I get the swine flu, I'll be, you know, remarkably  less healthy.  That's something we could do in a press release.  I understand that.  We're doing a medical study.  The ONA show is doing some kind of study.  See how contagious it is.  Yeah.  And people are actually coughing in Sam's face that have the swine flu.  But the problem is, you guys are not medical doctors.  You're, you know, radio professionals.  Yeah, we got Dr. Steve when he's awake.  If you get it.  Yeah, but he's drunk all the time.  If you get it, you got it.  If you don't get it, that's all we need to know.  That's a big deal.  We need to be doctors for that? 
[01:30:00]  It doesn't seem healthy.  It's the only thing.  I have health concerns.  Well, we got more people calling about your costume.  Costume.  Luke in Wisconsin.  Luke?  Hey, how you doing, gentlemen?  All right.  I think the most appropriate costume for him is, considering he's me getting cum shots  and gang bangs, he should be a porcupine so he can be porked from behind.  I don't quite get it.  And I'll tell you this.  Watch the spin on it.  I will wear a porcupine outfit, and that way I'll keep everybody off because they'll get 
[01:30:30]  stabbed with my quills if they come near me.  Oh.  How do you like that?  Oh, so you want to give.  No, I'm not going.  Oh, that's a good idea.  We got another suggestion.  John in Mobile, Alabama.  John?  Hey, you need to fly him out to Seattle.  Let him find that horse that did that other guy.  Okay.  Put on his furry outfit.  Go to town.  And get...  Great radio.  Wow.  Dude, that's a hell of a way to go out.  It is.  I mean, yes, it is a memorable way to go out, and I will fly to Seattle for this show. 
[01:31:00]  Will you please be fucked to death by a big, huge horse for the show?  That's where I'll draw the line.  No, I will not be fucked to death by a horse.  What's the problem with that bit?  Well, number one, it includes bestiality, which I'm not supportive of, and number two,  the payoff and end result would be my death, which I can also not get behind whatsoever.  So we're not into this show anymore.  Yeah, what the fuck?  He used to do anything.  Jake in Jersey.  Jake.  Hey, you know, I don't want to see anything happen to Sam because he's a lovely little fella. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you.  I think that he should take one for the team and do Bukkake furry fright.  Well, see, that would be...  Would you do a Bukkake video?  No, I would not do a Bukkake video because that would...  You'd look like a Rastafarian when you're done.  Twist it all up.  Probably.  I mean, it would get stuck in my hair and things.  It would be mentally scarring.  Yeah.  And it would not be a sexual turn-on at all.  How do you know that?  Yeah, how do you know that, Sam?  It is an assumption.  I will admit that it is an assumption. 
[01:32:00]  You've kissed men.  I have kissed four men.  I think it's fair to say that it's not gay if you're in a furry costume.  And you can't use that one out of context because it's true.  Well, that's...  Yeah.  Four men.  I'm going to punch it out.  Four, yeah.  Four.  That's pretty impressive, Sam.  I think.  Four men.  Or maybe three, but four times...  You are quite a fruit.  No, no, no.  That was all for, you know, theatrical reasons.  One used to do things for the show.  I mean, I'll still do things, just not... 
[01:32:30]  Are you going to Furry Fright or not?  I mean, you know, you're the boss here.  Yeah, well, we just need a costume.  Costume.  Well, I don't have a costume, obviously, because I'm not...  That's not my sexual proclivity.  I'm not a...  Stop using big words.  There's a guy who's going to Fur Fright 2009.  Yeah, but I don't want to use that guy's old furry costume, because he probably had intercourse  with it on.  He has a costume for you.  But all the dirty parts, you'll be cutting out anyway.  No, right?  I don't want to...  Like, it's probably got jizz on the ass, and maybe on the front, but we're going to cut 
[01:33:00]  out the cock, so you'll have a little cock hole, and we're going to cut out your  coulee hole, so your coulee sticks out.  He's got to let his ball bag hang, too, though.  Yeah, out of a different hole than the penis.  Very close together, but just one cock hole, and then pull your ball through the bottom  another hole.  You know that, uh, we've all seen the squirrel with the big ball bag?  Yeah.  Let's get you a...  Stryker's saying it, too.  Go with that.  Let's get you a squirrel costume.  Mm-hmm.  And then pull your balls through the bottom. 
[01:33:30]  See, I don't want to...  Oh, that's great.  I don't want to sound like a diva, but it's still bad, because I don't want a costume that  is in the private parts is dirty or cut out.  So if the private parts are missing or dirty...  No, no, oh, look at that.  Look, look, that's how you're feeling.  No, look at that as a squirrel.  We got the picture of the squirrel with the ball bag.  And you can just spray paint your ball bag in a ray like that.  Yeah.  I can respect and understand the humor value, but it's just not something that I think 
[01:34:00]  I'd be comfortable with.  Okay.  Because, you know, my testicles would be in plain sight.  It would be a good costume.  It would be a good costume.  Costume.  Costume.  Where does he learn?  Where did he...  I speak properly.  No, you really don't.  You're not supposed to speak properly like that.  That's how you speak costume.  I know your dad's from the 1800s.  No, he's not from the 1800s.  He should have taught you how to speak like they did back then.  He's not from the 1800s.  You sound like a Civil War letter. 
[01:34:30]  What do you got on Jay-Z and Rush Limbaugh?  There's a big beef there, Sam.  I think, to me, it's serious hip-hop beef going on between Rush, Limbaugh, and Jay-Z.  Wow, yo.  Yeah, exactly.  Because Jay-Z mentioned Rush in a song.  Now, sometimes when a rapper mentions you in a song, you don't even respond because you  don't want to dignify it.  You don't want to get involved in this beef.  Right.  Why should I be pumping him up?  However, Rush responded, which means the beef is on.  Oh, shit.  Did he respond in rap?  No, he responded in his radio show.  Oh, really?  Well, we got the Jay-Z... 
[01:35:00]  Just a clip of it.  Yeah, from the song where he mentions Rush Limbaugh.  Chris, we off that.  Tim's, we off that.  Brim's, we off that.  Yeah, we off that.  Is he still on that?  Are we still making money?  Because we're still on that.  This ain't black versus white, my nigga.  We off that.  Please tell Bill O'Reilly to fall back.  Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls.  It's 2010 or 1864.  Yeah, we come so raw, so I drive around town.  Hard top and it's all.  And my tribe back a lot with my high brow.  And my high yellow brow. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  I really don't know what is going on.  He said Rush Limbaugh is on his balls?  Yes.  On Jay-Z's balls.  Yeah, he said it's not a black and white thing.  This is 2009, not 1864.  And then again, it got to the whole point of how, you know, he has to have the car and everything.  You gotta drive around a hard time.  Like every rap artist has to have what car they drive, where they live, how much money they're making.  But he's setting new trends.  Swinging dope and shit.  That song is called Off That.  He's saying, Tim's, we're off that. 
[01:36:00]  What?  But what?  So, is Jay-Z, just to go serious for a second here, Jay-Z is assuming that Rush Limbaugh doesn't like Obama because he's black?  Yes.  And if you don't like Obama, you are racist.  I would assume that Jay-Z believes that.  But Jay-Z seems to be a little smarter than that there, Sam.  Jay-Z's highly intelligent.  Why is he playing that game?  I would figure some other rappers would probably play that game.  Yeah.  Some of the down and dirty guys.  But Jay-Z, he's pretty mainstream. 
[01:36:30]  I think Jay-Z firmly believes that Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh are probably racist people.  They don't like Obama, so they have to be racist, right?  I think he thought they were both racist before, but he thinks the reason they don't like Obama is because Obama is black and they are racist.  I think this is, you know.  So Rush Limbaugh responded to Jay-Z.  Yes, he did.  I don't even know how you respond to that because I don't really know what the translation is there.  He said it was on his balls.  On his balls. 
[01:37:00]  Yes, precisely.  All right.  I guess he's responding to that.  All right.  As far as I know, I have never been mentioned in a rap song by anybody.  Yes, it means I've made it.  I'm now in a rap tune by the famous rapper Jay-Z.  Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls.  Tell Bill O'Reilly to fall back.  I would remind the rapper Jay-Z, Mr. Z, it is President Obama who wants mandate circumcision. 
[01:37:30]  We had that yesterday, and that means if anybody, if we need to save our penises from anybody, it's Obama.  I did not know I was on anybody's balls either.  I'm happy to know that they think I am, though.  But I didn't actually know that I was.  That's all he has on it?  Rush Limbaugh sucks.  He really sucks.  That's it.  When he's not talking politics.  I was hoping he would delve a little more into how he isn't on his balls. 
[01:38:00]  On his balls.  Young Hove is a victor in that one.  What?  What?  Young Hove.  Jay-Z.  That's one of his nicknames.  Is what?  Young Hove.  Because his name's Hove of the God.  Jay-Hove.  You know.  Like Jehovah, but with a J.  Jay-Hove.  Holy shit.  God MC.  No.  Young Hove in the house.  I didn't know that.  So necessary.  Totally don't even need to know that. 
[01:38:30]  You didn't.  No.  No.  And you don't want to know.  Because Rush is on his ball.  Yes.  Well, that's ridiculous.  Yeah.  But I guess the ball's back in...  Jay-Z's a court now.  Young Hove's a court.  Now he's got his fun.  Dan has a problem with you, Anthony.  What?  I'm sure you would like to respond to this.  Dan in Jersey.  Dan?  Hey, Anthony.  You find it annoying when people talk about their house and their cars and their money? 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Hmm.  Okay.  Oh, I got it.  Oh, I got it.  In a rap song.  You know what, though?  See, it's interesting to talk about how, you know, you worked for it.  Well, not this fake gangster slinging dope and driving around in the same fucking cars with  the same stupid fucking bitches and hoes and smacking them bitches up and hanging with  your homies slinging dope. 
[01:39:30]  And fuck, that is the most cliche bullshit that's out there as far as hip-hop goes.  I've had it with that.  All right, we get it.  Do you enjoy it?  You drive a nice car.  You got your fucking jewelry.  Your jewelry.  I wear good jewelry.  Fuck you.  It's jewelry.  Would you fucking say it?  And if I got to hear Magic Johnson say goals, like go.  What?  That fucking commercial that Magic Johnson is doing.  I don't know that one. 
[01:40:00]  He goes, he goes, we all have goes.  And if you want to achieve your go, there's an L in that word.  It's goal.  Say goals.  Fuck.  The language is being changed, my friend.  There's laziness in the tongue.  It's tongue lazy.  How do you say it?  Goal.  You have to take the tongue and put it behind your upper teeth and get goal.  It's easy to just go, go.  That's the white man's way to say it. 
[01:40:30]  Go.  Well, fuck that.  That's the white man's way.  It's called English.  It's called the fucking Queen's, King's English.  One of the two fuckers.  How do you say it?  I got two for you.  All right.  We're going to do a little thing here.  I'm going to spell a word and you pronounce it.  All righty.  And then Sam will pronounce the same word.  Mm-hmm.  How do you say that word?  Air.  Er.  Er.  Or the other one is a-er. 
[01:41:00]  A-er.  A-er.  A-er.  All right.  I got another one.  I had to get my her did.  And I'm spelling another word?  I got my her done.  How do you say this word, Anthony?  Her.  No.  Her.  Here.  All right.  Here.  Sam?  Her.  Her.  Right there.  Right there.  See, but these are Southern.  This is Southern hip-hop.  Well, that is Southern hip-hop, but-  Very big right now, though.  You know what?  This is also Southern hip-hop.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken. 
[01:41:30]  Southern fried chicken.  Finger let's get fried chicken.  Fried that chicken.  Fried that chicken.  Fried that chicken.  Woo-hoo!  Yeah, what's going on?  Why are they mispronouncing everything now there, Sam?  It's just cultural.  It's just a cultural difference.  There's something about L's.  I think it's because it's the white man's language, and they don't want to speak the  white man way.  No, there's something about the L.  They know that the L is there.  That is not cultural.  It transcends culture. 
[01:42:00]  When Magic Johnson says go, I want to fucking throw something through my TV.  We all have goes.  It'll help you achieve your go.  Go?  That's G-O.  That means to go.  Sometimes somebody will change their dialect so they sound a little different, and people  will think they sound cool, so they'll start kind of saying the word like that.  And just like that, culture changes the English language.  It's an amazing thing. 
[01:42:30]  Really?  That's the power of the people, though.  All right, Sam.  Blue Blazer?  What about him?  When you kill yourself?  No.  See?  That's distasteful.  Yeah, but that accomplishes our goal, which is...  Our go.  Our go.  What's your goal?  For you to kill yourself for the good of the show.  And you're a wrestling fan.  It's perfect.  I'm a wrestling fan, but I don't like the idea.  I don't like your go. 
[01:43:00]  You don't like his go?  No.  I think our goes are getting mixed up.  All right.  The whole idea that Magic Johnson once had a talk show is the funniest thing ever, because  he is a man who really cannot speak well.  No.  He can't.  He's incapable.  He would fuck words up so badly.  You'll go.  It was a great show.  I got to hear that commercial, though.  Yeah, I know.  I wish I remembered what it was for, but I'm so... 
[01:43:30]  That commercial annoys me, and the burglar alarm commercial annoys me.  The one that used to be Brinks Home Security.  Oh, yeah.  And now they change their name to something else.  And it's always the families in the house, and they lock the door and set the alarm, and  crazy, evil white guy kicks the door in.  And it's different scenarios.  One, they're out back playing, and the mother and daughter come in to have some lunch, and  crazy white guy kicks the door in. 
[01:44:00]  And then one is a woman who, I guess, just broke up with her boyfriend and is kissing  or saying goodbye to a date on the front stoop, and the boyfriend's been stalking her.  She sets the alarm.  He kicks the door in.  Crazy white guy.  Then another one, the parents go out, leave the daughter home.  She's like, don't worry, don't worry.  Sets the alarm, and crazy white guy kicks the fucking door in again.  Maybe they live in predominantly white neighborhoods.  One, give me one fucking black criminal on those goddamn burglar alarm commercials. 
[01:44:30]  It's all I'm asking for.  They're just trying to change the way we view it.  Oh, stop it.  Another show that's coming out, looks good, is that survival show that this guy's going  to teach you how to survive everything.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nuclear holocaust.  Oh, that looks really good.  That looks good, but let me tell you something that pissed me off.  Oh, boy.  The one about the plane, where hijackers take the plane over.  They start yelling and screaming, and then he's in the seat and goes, I'll tell you how  to get through this. 
[01:45:00]  Right, right.  Just listen to me.  It's fucking Chet Wilson and his band of hijackers.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's Peter Smith and his band of fucking horrible hijackers.  They're all white, American-looking, just regular waspy guys hijacking the plane.  Could you at least have thrown some Arabs on the fucking plane and made it more realistic?  Well, they don't want to piss off those people.  Well, you know something? 
[01:45:30]  That's who did it.  But the funny thing about that, as they don't want to piss off those people, they piss off  white people.  Whitey is getting really fucking pissed these days.  How does that make sense?  Because that's why they're doing that.  Yeah.  You don't want to piss off this group of people, but fuck, Whitey could handle it.  So we'll put Whitey in these horrendous roles.  Let me explain to you something.  Whitey is getting really pissed these days.  I read a lot.  I read a lot of communication between Whitey. 
[01:46:00]  Whitey's not happy.  There's actually a black guy out there right now.  Can't remember the name.  He's on YouTube.  You seen that clip?  Well, that guy is just ranting and raving about Obama.  He calls Obama the long-legged mac daddy or something.  And he says he better watch what he's doing because white people are getting mad and they're  ready to rise up.  We'll find that clip at some point. 
[01:46:30]  But yeah, Whitey, I think, is getting more mad.  But why is it all right to protect this group and don't piss them off, but put Whitey in that  role?  I know.  I don't get it.  D.B. Cooper was white.  Huh?  D.B. Cooper was white.  He just jumped out of a bag.  He didn't hijack the damn thing, really.  He didn't, like, put...  Yeah, he just kind of...  He needed some money.  You know.  He was after the Benjamins, yo.  See?  White guys and black guys want those Benjis.  I like how far you have to go back.  D.B. Cooper. 
[01:47:00]  D.B. Cooper.  Wow, you got us there.  Orville and Wilbur were white, too.  And right.  Jesus.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Yes, I got a Sammage.  Once again, we didn't get anything done with Sam.  He's not going to kill himself, and he's not going to furry fright.  He's going to furry fright.  We went through the Jay-Z stuff.  We did some talk about the commercials.  Yeah, that was amazing, Sam.  Plus, we got the energy up.  Oh, shit.  The way he says that.  You are going to make a great... 
[01:47:30]  You're going to make great middle management someday.  That's not bad.  It's horrible.  What?  Look around.  Oh, you're hard.  Look at those guys.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  You want to be part of that crowd?  Really?  Like, bossing me around.  No power, and they report to people.  Wow, that's exciting.  How will this help the company?  It's a good question.  Yeah.  All right, Sam.  Get lost.  Okay, bye.  Scram.  Quick break. 
[01:48:00]  Robert Kelly's going to join the show in about 15, 20 minutes.  Whooppy.  And we'll get into some other things.  Right.  I want to know what this KFC Double Down thing is all about.  I think Danny knows, right?  Double Down.  Was that your thing?  The KFC?  What was that?  Sam?  Sorry.  Jesus Christ.  Look at what you're talking about.  Chicken.  Of course it's going to be Sam.  For Christ's sake.  Sam, what's going to do?  Who's going to hand you a story about chicken?  Fuck.  We want to eat, Sam.  You think I'm going to hand you a story about fried chicken?  Hell fucking no.  It's a good story.  Everybody want to piece of my chicken? 
[01:48:30]  Southern fried chicken.  King the chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Fried chicken.  Oh, that peaches.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  It's all in good.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  Eat that watermelon.  It's all in good.  What is the Double Down KFC thing?  Is this a quickie, Sam?  Yeah, it's quick.  What is it?  It's like the greatest sandwich ever invented.  Instead of a bun, they use two fried chicken fillets. 
[01:49:00]  Stop it.  And then what's in the middle?  The bun?  Cheese, bacon, and secret sauce cheese.  That's right.  Are you serious?  That's fantastic.  What is the life expectancy?  I think it's right now, KFC only has it in a couple states.  They're testing it.  I wonder what states.  It's actually Rhode Island.  Okay.  But then it's also like Omaha and Nebraska.  So what is the point?  That is odd.  What do you mean?  What's the point?  Well, it's not healthier. 
[01:49:30]  No, it's more delicious.  It's more delicious?  Yes.  Would you eat that?  Hell yeah, I would eat that.  Do you know that...  What?  Wow, really?  Yeah.  No, nothing, nothing.  Nothing?  Okay.  You know that restaurant we went to eat at just before break?  Wow.  In Times Square?  That was a long time ago.  Oh, yeah.  With the comics and Robert Eatman?  Yes.  You know they have on the menu there a deep fried grilled cheese sandwich? 
[01:50:00]  Oh, shit.  Why would you do that?  How amazing does that sound?  Wow.  Deep fried grilled cheese sandwich.  I would eat that.  All right.  So it's called the Double Down, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's check this out.  Are you counting carbs?  Yes.  Maybe you've even given up eating bread.  Well, let's face it.  This sandwich still isn't for you.  Feast your eyes on the KFC Double Down Sandwich.  Oh, that looks low and fat.  Where bread isn't necessary because the rolls have been replaced by fried chicken. 
[01:50:30]  Yes, the sandwich consists of two fried chicken fillets with a filling of bacon, cheese, and kernel sauce.  Now, this mysterious sandwich seems to exist only in Rhode Island and Nebraska for now, apparently.  And it's being test marketed.  And you can't find it listed on KFC's website either.  But we did call a KFC restaurant in Nebraska today because we're on this story.  And they told us that they are, in fact, selling this sandwich.  The best thing since sliced bread. 
[01:51:00]  Well, maybe.  You get it, right?  Because it doesn't have bread.  No bread.  Just breading.  Great.  L.A.'s burning.  And they're doing a story on a dumb sandwich.  You're going to get some kernel sauce in your face at the Furry Fright Fuck Convention?  No.  I'm not going to get any kernel sauce.  You're going to get kernel sauce on your hiney hole?  No.  You can just make believe it's tartar sauce.  Yeah.  I don't like sauces.  No?  No.  But you like kids.  Especially not in my coolie.  In your coolie hole. 
[01:51:30]  We're going to break now.  Yeah.  This is exhausting.  This Sam guy is exhausting.  Oh, you're still here.  Yeah, I'm still standing in earshot.  All right.  Let's see.  What's this? 
[01:52:00]  Really?  All right.  We all noticed when we got in this morning that Steve, lovely Steve, is wearing a denim vest that's kind of frayed.  Is that the proper word?  Frayed on the edges? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  It's got the frayed fringe.  Yeah.  And I don't think that look was ever in style.  No.  I know a lot of styles are coming back, but I don't know if that one ever was in style.  Really?  Really?  I don't even think Dice would wear that.  He's the only person that could get away with it.  And, um, the guys all noticed that Steve looks ridiculous.  And Danny has found a picture of that exact vest on a...  Oh, shit.  On a black... 
[01:53:00]  On a black...  A giant...  Has to be gay gentleman.  Gay bodybuilding black gentleman.  Wow.  Yeah.  So Sam went backstage to try to get to the bottom of Steve's...  Oh, his vest.  Denim vest.  Hey.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  Opie and Anthony executive producer and gay fashion icon Steve C made another splash recently 
[01:53:30]  showing up to work in a homoerotic denim biker vest with cut-off sleeves.  We talked to Sirius S.M.'s best-dressed employee Steve C about the uncomfortable choice.  Steve.  Yes, Sam.  In the past, you've made some questionable fashion choices that have been pointed out to you.  Some.  What are you wearing today?  It is a denim sleeveless vest, I guess, or shirt?  I would say vest.  Okay.  Well, shirt. 
[01:54:00]  It is a shirt at one...  It was a shirt at one point.  Now it's a vest.  Well, I don't think it was.  These fringes look man-made.  Yeah, they are.  They are.  I purchased it with no sleeves.  Now, what made you decide to wear a denim vest to work today?  Well, it was clean and...  But you could have just worn a shirt you chose to accessorize with a vest.  I did.  Now, is it your intention to look more like a motorcycle man in that jacket or in that vest?  No.  Is it your intention to look more attractive to the gay porn community in that vest? 
[01:54:30]  No.  But is it an added benefit of the vest?  It could...  I don't know if it's a fringe benefit, so to speak, as...  No pun intended.  Yeah, puns suck.  What is that vest?  Yeah, I know.  With so much to like about it, we polled the Opie and Anthony Show staff to find out what  their favorite part of the Steve C. vest was.  What's your favorite part of Steve's vest?  I don't know if he purposely did that to the sleeves, but it's very fitting. 
[01:55:00]  The fringes, you mean?  Yes, the fringes.  Lawrence, what's your favorite part about Steve's vest?  I'd say the cool patch that's over his heart, the Laconia patch.  You like that Laconia patch?  I like that a lot.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Yeah.  You sound like you're not being sarcastic.  No, no, no.  I actually like patches like that and that one over his heart.  It's pretty cool.  Hey, Travis, what's your favorite part about Steve's vest?  The color.  Sky blue.  You can't go wrong.  The lightest shade of denim without being white. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, you don't want denim too dark.  You always want it light.  Whether it's the fringes, the color, or the giant eagle on the back, one thing's for sure.  Steve C. looks like a horse's ass.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  During the break, Steve walked in with the vest.  Yes.  And Sam was still in here because we did a little segment with Sam.  And Sam goes, ooh, watch out, tough guy in the room.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:56:00]  Tough guy.  Hey, tough guy.  I don't know.  What do you want?  What do you want to do with the vest?  It just looks horrendous.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  It's just another part of Steve's wardrobe that over the years has shocked and amazed us.  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  Let me get a look at it.  I didn't really get a look at it.  E-Rock, what do you think of Steve's vest?  I'm so gay.  Look at what you're wearing.  What the fuck is that? 
[01:56:30]  This is my new UFC hoodie.  It's a little loud.  What's wrong, Danny?  You know what?  You had Steve in a corner.  And you probably had him.  Steve was the fucking fashion victim today.  Right, right.  Dude, I had a bullseye on me.  You had him so bad.  And you're walking in.  Describe this UFC vest.  It looks like Spider-Man.  No, it doesn't.  What it is is it is bright, bright, bright fucking red. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  It has a print all over the whole thing of a chain link fence.  Like the cage.  Like the cage.  And then UFC written all over the place.  All over it.  Yeah.  It is loud.  It's hip-hop-ish.  It's also new.  They just sent it to us yesterday.  Oh.  And by us?  No.  Yeah, there's a big box of UFC stuff.  There's a big box of stuff for everybody.  And that's the one you picked out?  Did you watch the UFC?  Yes, I started not too long ago. 
[01:57:30]  Who fought at UFC 102?  Nice.  Randy Cotar, but he lost.  I didn't get to see the whole fight because my flight got in around 9.  So I didn't get to see everything.  What's wrong?  Yeah, it just looked this.  What, do you want that?  The really good ones were taken by Mars, so.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Mars got some good ones.  I just don't understand, like, the.  There are some people that probably shouldn't be wearing, like, UFC gear.  Put it that way.  Oh, I.  I'm just saying. 
[01:58:00]  I got you.  People tend to look a little ridiculous when they start wearing UFC stuff.  Like, here it is.  Here it is.  Danny is wearing an Eraserhead shirt.  Danny is a horror movie buff.  It completely fits Danny to wear that.  I am a maniac, lunatic gun nut.  So I tend to dress like an army man.  Like a young Fidel Castro.  Right.  Nobody really thinks twice about it because I really am a psychopath.  We're used to the new look.  Yes.  Steve, even wearing that wacky, goofy vest, comes off as a gay gentleman. 
[01:58:30]  Of course.  And the vest just reinforces that.  Right.  You.  Try something new.  With the UFC thing.  You really like that UFC hoodie?  No.  The one I really like, Mars took from me.  So this was the only other one.  Yeah, but Mars is a guy who should be wearing UFC stuff.  Right, right.  So who gives a shit?  No, I'm just saying.  It's not very fitting.  Bobby Kelly has entered the studio.  We're talking about Steve's, yeah, denim vest. 
[01:59:00]  Steve's gay vest.  And then E-Rock comes in to bash it.  And look what E-Rock is.  But look at him.  Fucking idiot.  God damn it.  You look like a fucking mascot for the UFC.  Who looks worse?  Who really is?  Just Steve.  Who looks worse?  Steve fucking.  Come on.  He's wearing a dungaree.  Get off me.  Dungaree.  What?  Dungarees.  Looks like Christy McNichols and fucking. 
[01:59:30]  Christy McNichols.  Fucking.  I mean, fucking.  Where did you get off me?  What's on the back of that?  Let me see.  Oh, no.  The bottom.  Come.  Okay.  I'm wondering.  What is that?  It's a two-year-old Laconia ripped sleeve shirt.  Ah.  Yeah, but why is it shredded so puffy and big?  I got it for $5 in Northeast Pennsylvania.  You could buy a thong for two. 
[02:00:00]  Would you wear it?  Yeah, go ahead, Danny.  All of Steve's fashion faux pas are never his fault.  Right, yeah.  It's just like, oh, it was five bucks on my chum bought it.  Yeah, he just stumbles across this.  How is that evading responsibility?  That's complete.  That's not an evasion of responsibility.  I said I bought it.  I never accidentally wore a horror movie t-shirt to work.  I never said, well, it was $2 at the Salvation Army.  I got it for five bucks.  But be proud of it.  If you're wearing it, just be like, yeah, man.  It's awesome.  I fucking dig it a whole bunch.  I do.  Believe me.  I bought this for $5 this weekend when I was in Plymouth, Pennsylvania. 
[02:00:30]  You said it's about two years ago.  No.  I said it's a two-year-old.  Oh.  I got it for $5 when I was at Kielbasi Fest this weekend.  Kielbasi Fest.  You should never be going to Kielbasi Fest.  You went to Kielbasi Fest?  Kielbasi Fest is an annual event.  Did you have your hiney hole cut out of your pants?  No, not that kind of Kielbasi.  It's an actual real Kielbasi that the Polish folk in Plymouth, Pennsylvania, it's a street  fair.  They line up and they all have traditional Polish cuisine. 
[02:01:00]  You look like a lesbian.  So Steve on vacation went to a sausage fest.  Yes.  You went to a sausage party.  He went alone, too.  Oh, shit.  And he traveled to one.  I mean, they do those festivals every weekend around here.  You can find one of those fucking things.  You can go to Greenpoint.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes, E-Rock.  He also told us in the office that he has the official Kielbasi Fest t-shirt that he'll  be debuting tomorrow.  It's big and orange. 
[02:01:30]  Big and orange.  Really.  You know what the problem is?  Is that you have too much dungaree on.  Dungaree.  It's just too much.  You got to wear a fucking jumpsuit.  It's too much.  You have a shirt and it's a different color.  That's light denim on top and down here is like a darker denim.  And didn't you see that same look on, what's his name, the American Idol guy that came  out of the closet?  Lambert?  Adam Lambert.  Adam Lambert. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  There's a picture of Adam Lambert wearing something very similar to what you're wearing  today.  He's trendy.  Less clothing.  And he's out of the closet as well.  And you're wearing your culottes again.  No, these are different.  These are just different.  These are capris.  No, these aren't the capris.  They're not quite the capris.  They're not quite the capris.  They're a little bit higher than the capris.  Barely.  Those are...  No, these aren't capris.  They're almost capris.  He walked in with capris.  I'd love to defend him because I like Steve a lot.  And his hair is fucking weird too. 
[02:02:30]  What are you doing with the hair?  This is what it does naturally.  He's growing his hair out.  I'm growing my hair out and it curls naturally.  But it's like one of the golden girls.  It's like...  It's fucking...  I'll be honest with you.  I've been trying the nioxin for a while to see if I can get rid of this fucking bald...  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  It just makes you pee yellow.  It makes you cum yellow too.  I swear to God.  Why?  You tried all that shit?  Yeah, I tried all that shit and I fucking...  I blew a load and yellow nuggets came out.  Ew.  Yeah.  Really? 
[02:03:00]  Right, yeah.  That doesn't seem healthy.  No, it doesn't.  But now look at me.  It didn't work.  I'm not wearing fucking dungaree fucking outfits.  All right.  Well, E-Rock, thanks.  You almost had Steve.  Yeah, E-Rock...  One day you'll figure this whole thing out.  E-Rock...  Jesus.  That'll never happen.  We finally gave E-Rock the spot to be like a hero.  Come in, beat the shit out of Steve.  And he walks in like that.  It's like, hey, E-Rock, what do you think of Steve's best?  Like we're trying to make him part of the team.  Yeah, yeah.  And for once he's on our side and he walks in with that ridiculous UFC hoodie on. 
[02:03:30]  That thing looked silly.  But that is made for like hip-hop UFC type fans.  You know what I mean?  You should...  Like they're smart with their marketing.  They know it runs the gamut.  So it's like, all right, that would be more someone that's kind of in the hip-hop world that also likes UFC.  They would wear that.  You should really kind of have a build if you're going to wear that.  Just a little bit.  It's just like to be able to fight a little.  If you're going to wear like a Gold's Gym t-shirt, you should probably try to be a little in shape. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  You ever make fun of people that are walking down the street?  Big fat guy with Gold's Gym.  It's all the time, actually.  The worst is the biker guys.  The guys who ride the bikes but actually get the Lance Armstrong outfit, too.  The tight, even the little clicky shoes.  Click-clicks.  They have those on.  Those guys.  And the hat.  Those guys piss me off.  What are they doing, man?  What the fuck are you doing?  There's no way to hide your cock in that.  They have like a little cushion on their asshole for the seat.  That's all that it is. 
[02:04:30]  It's like a cushioned aspirin that they just sit on in a fucking little seat.  Yeah.  Okay.  What's up, Bobby?  What's up, fella?  This is the weirdest.  Hell of a way to get you in studio.  Yeah.  A second day back from vacation, so we're trying to get back into the rhythm.  I know.  I kept up with you guys on Twitter.  Two fucking weeks off.  You were just...  I didn't Twitter much.  What they call the staycation.  Yeah, you didn't do shit.  Why would I?  If you had a palace, I'd stay home.  I hung out.  That's what I did.  It's good. 
[02:05:00]  I missed you at the party, by the way.  Why didn't you go to the big party that Ant had?  I was excited.  The first invite I ever got, and I was up in New Hampshire.  I was being a fucking man-man up in New Hampshire, fly fishing.  What?  Like Brad Pitt in a river with waders.  Oh, really?  I caught a trout.  Wait, did you?  You tried fly fishing?  Try it?  What are you talking about?  I am a fly...  I'm an angler, dude.  There's a fucking direct word.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You've been doing this your whole life?  No, I did it for a week.  I'm a fucking addict.  Why?  I don't get it.  I like fishing. 
[02:05:30]  I fish my whole life.  Right.  I've been a worm to barber guy.  You know, you fucking put a fat, huge American night crawler, not those Canadian fucking AIDS  night crawlers they have.  Don't...  If you ever fuck up and buy one of them, you go to the store, you buy the night crawlers  up in New Hampshire, you can just go in next to the deli meats, there's a fucking  bucket of worms, just dirt on them.  Fishing rocks.  Oh, dude.  The fly fishing, though, I don't get.  Fly fishing is so much better.  Why?  Dude, I made my own fly.  Yeah, who gives a shit? 
[02:06:00]  I made it with my dog's hair.  I cut a little of his hair off.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  Where'd you read this?  Online?  What?  What do you mean?  How to make it.  Did you read that?  No, my...  Cut off a little of your dog's ears is a trick.  I got five, you know, I got five uncles.  You know, the manly Irish Catholic Boston uncles.  That explains a lot.  And...  I know, right?  How many touched you out of the five?  I wish one of them did.  I could explain everything.  I just feel like he fucking blew me when I was nine.  There's something about them and flies, too.  Nice dog.  Completely different. 
[02:06:30]  But I was up there with...  They got this house up in a...  It's sick.  It's sick, insane house.  In the middle of the friggin' woods.  I like New Hampshire.  Dirt road.  Oh, it's awesome.  New Hampshire's all right.  And I went up there and he took me out fly fishing.  Look at that fucking thing.  Look at that fish.  Wow.  Look at that.  Huh?  What is that?  A trout you said?  That's a big goddamn fish.  Well, it's not really that big.  I just didn't put anything next to it.  Yeah, there's no real...  Oh, wait a minute.  I think you guys see your hand poking out of the top.  Oh, it's a guppy.  That's a minnow.  It's just a close-up of a guppy.  Something.  You can see on the next page.  There you go. 
[02:07:00]  Look at you, you asshole.  What?  It's small?  Yeah, it's not all that big.  How small was it?  It was around seven inches.  That thing is like the size of his fucking...  The cork handle on it.  But look how pretty it is.  Look how pretty it is.  Look how pretty it is.  The first picture makes it look like it's overfoot.  It looks huge.  Yeah, it looks huge.  That's fucking huge.  That's how he photographs his cocks.  Of course you do.  Give him nothing to fucking...  Give him a scale.  Oh, you have a video cam...  Don't put a dime next to your dick and take a picture of it.  You have a video cam with a chick you get.  I actually stretch my balls. 
[02:07:30]  I sit on my own nuts.  And I just hold the bottom of the shaft of my cock  so it looks like there's another fucking seven inches  and the top of your helmet fills up with blood  so it gets a little fatter.  You never, ever fucking...  There's a way to, you know...  You've never done that.  Take a cock pick, I guess.  I want to know more about this fly fishing, though,  because I think it's a waste of time.  Are you letting your mind...  Somebody else called us recently and said,  until you try it.  It's fucking insane.  You get right in the... 
[02:08:00]  You don't stand on the edge  and wait for a bobber to bounce up and down  for frigging six hours.  That's fucking stupid.  I worm fish my whole life.  I used to fish in puddles  with like a curtain rod hook and meatloaf  when I was fucking in first grade.  Get a nice lure.  Yeah, a lure.  And just throw it in there.  A lure is a...  You throw it in and reel it back.  Throw it in and reel it.  It's boring.  And you do a little yanking  to really do damage to the fish.  Dude, a fly fishing.  You go in the water.  You put waders on.  You walk in the fucking stream. 
[02:08:30]  That's how...  Okay.  And then you cast it  and you get a cat...  There's no weights.  There he is right there.  Look at him.  Gorgeous.  I don't want to get in there with him.  That's me.  That's not you.  That's me.  Wait, we can go to your Twitter  and see this video?  Look at that.  I'm a fucking angler.  Wait.  I'm a goddamn angler.  Wait, start it over.  I want to hear Bobby  talking about fly fishing.  What river is this?  Ellis.  Ellis River in New Hampshire.  Jackson.  What?  Jackson, New Hampshire. 
[02:09:00]  Jackson, New Hampshire.  Whatever.  My fucking uncle.  Now you know why I'm so fucked up.  Oh, good.  I'm just fly fishing.  That's right.  Bob Kelly.  Nature.  Fly fishing.  I'm about to catch a 22-inch.  What's a trout?  Penis.  What?  Nothing.  Trout.  I'm about to catch a trout.  Yeah, baby.  All right.  Hit the button.  All right.  Hit the button.  Jesus.  You got waders on.  Oh, yeah.  And the whole get-up.  You got like a vest on  and the hat. 
[02:09:30]  You're all in.  You got the outfit.  You got the shoes.  You got the fly fishing outfit.  The shoes have like a thick felt bottom  so you can walk on the rocks.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  You walk right in.  You walk right in the room.  But the thing is is that, you know,  you still fall.  I almost fucking killed myself.  Did, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  But rocks aren't even.  Explain to me.  Like someone tiled it.  There was one rock.  Literally, it was a huge,  the size of the studio rock  that kind of just went right into the river.  So I'm standing on it  and I wanted to get down  right to the river's edge  so I thought I'd just sit on my ass 
[02:10:00]  and slide down  because it was really slippery.  Oh, boy.  But those waders, dude,  I literally was holding on.  I just started sliding  like a water slide  because the waders are rubber  and I'm a fucking moron.  You're not.  What are you thinking?  I'm digging my fingernails  into the rock.  My uncle's up in the car  making a fucking phone call.  I'm all by myself  in a river  sliding into rapids.  You're to drown.  Yeah, that would have been great.  It would have been done.  It would have been done.  But it would have been a great story.  Jesus. 
[02:10:30]  Dude, fly fishing is the best.  You sit there.  You let the fly come down.  You got to find out  what they eaten  and shit like that.  Like you got to get the bugs around  and pick one up  and then match it.  It's called matching the hatch.  Matching the hatch.  Say that.  Just say matching the hatch.  No, I don't want to say it.  Matching the hatch.  The hatch.  The hatch.  It's the hatch.  After you match the hatch,  what happens?  You match the hatch.  You go to your fly box.  You get whatever they're eating.  You throw it on.  You got to tie a blood knot  to get the lines together.  Then you got to tie 
[02:11:00]  a perfection knot  to the frigging fly.  And yep,  I got the iPhone  fucking fly fishing knot app.  Did you know they have it?  Oh, really?  Really?  I didn't doubt they did.  I knew you would have  some type of app.  Oh, I'm on the river with this.  Look.  Look, they get the fly fishing app  right here.  You go back in.  You can tie a knot.  You can tie a blood knot.  Look at that.  Fishing knots right there.  Unbelievable.  But then what?  There's a technique for this  that's a little weird, right?  Yeah, you got to...  Cast out.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, you got to cast. 
[02:11:30]  You got to...  Whatever.  No, you got to do this.  You got to whip it back.  10-2, 10-2.  And it goes out  like Brad Pitt  on a river runs through.  He did the old  rainbow flying technique  that's very hard to do.  I wouldn't be able to do that.  I'd have to be an angler  in Missoula, Montana.  You got to kind of keep going  and get it further away?  Is that like whipping  that fucking fly out there?  Yeah, you got to go back,  stop, forward, stop.  You can't bend your wrist  because there's no weight on it 
[02:12:00]  so you're using the actual line  to get the fly  way the fuck out there.  And then what?  You got to pull line out  because it's not going  to come off the reel.  You want to get it upriver,  let the fly land  because the line,  there's like seven feet  of thin, thin line  with the fly  and you let it land on top  like a real bug  and then it floats down.  And then a fucking trout  comes up and grabs it  and then you pull  and then you reel it in.  Reel in that monster  fucking fish 
[02:12:30]  you reeled in there.  That's seven inches.  That's fucking  little,  you fucking bag the sardine.  This is the fucking thing though  is these guys  have like different size rods  so like my uncle  has a zero weight.  Nice talking to you.  Especially in this fucking studio.  I know.  You'd be catching  fucking tuna  with your cock.  But yeah,  I just fucking got into it.  I'm a nature man.  So now what?  Are you going to go back there  and do it again? 
[02:13:00]  Dude,  I went to Delhi, New York  to do a college  on Saturday  and I hired the opener  to drive me up  and I made him stop  in Roscoe, New York  and fucking,  he sat in the car  this little fucking  Guatemalan, Puerto Rican.  Fucking fly fish.  Dude,  I was out in the river  walking up and down  with the other old people.  He was in the car  sleeping  like my bitch.  Are you serious?  Oh,  yeah,  fuck,  absolutely.  I'm in the river.  I was there all day.  I made him drive me up there 
[02:13:30]  at like 11 in the morning.  We were up there all,  the show wasn't until 11 at night.  Wow.  I'm in the river all day.  What'd you do,  the college up there in Delhi?  I did the Delhi call.  Oh my God,  how fucking crazy is that?  That's a crazy college.  Sick shit up there.  Yeah,  I do it once a year.  Marty who runs it,  it's fucking,  they had a stabbing last year.  Yeah.  Yeah,  one of the fucking students  just stabbed the other guy  at a basketball game.  Yeah,  it's fucking,  it's ghetto.  I was trying to tell the other kid,  there was another opener  on the show  and he was like,  oh,  it should be fun.  I'm like,  have you been here?  I'm like,  it's kind of ghetto.  You don't realize it's ghetto 
[02:14:00]  when you're driving to get there  and you have to go through  a town called Bovina.  Is there really a town called Bovina?  Of course there is.  Why wouldn't there be  an Andes?  Yeah,  it's kind of creepy  up in that giant man.  Yeah,  but I stopped and fly fished  all day up there.  I'm going back up.  Want to go?  Maybe.  Why would anyone  want to go to fly fish?  As much as I make fun,  maybe.  Listen,  why would anybody  want to fucking own  95 guns  in a house  in Long Island?  I bet I'd get more fish  than you with my guns.  Would you shoot, 
[02:14:30]  would you go hunting?  I can blast them.  I don't like killing things.  I don't like killing  things either,  man.  I mean,  let me,  let me,  you feel sorry  for the fish?  I let them go.  You don't take them.  You don't take,  I'm an angler.  You don't take them.  Listen to him,  I'm an angler.  What are you going to do  with a seven inch fish?  You put them back.  Even if it's,  even if it's a whopper.  What if you caught  a monster,  dude?  I'm putting it back.  What am I going to do?  First of all,  you catch a monster,  if you take it back,  anytime,  like even lobster,  when you get the big  fucking lobster,  the meat always sucks  and there's always  like dead babies inside. 
[02:15:00]  You hold it up,  take a picture  and then let it go.  You take a picture,  you fwop it back in.  Yeah.  You got to let it go  in a certain way  it will die.  Oh yeah,  you got to kind of  get the water  going back through  his gills.  You got to wet your hands  before you can touch  the fish.  So, you know,  you're spit on your  fucking my fucking  dead babies  on the fucking fish  from jerking off  the night before.  Yeah,  I couldn't,  I couldn't go hunting.  I was watching that.  The,  uh,  was it the outdoor  channel they have now?  Wow.  You are fucking deep.  Those guys,  I can't fucking,  I could,  I can't, 
[02:15:30]  I don't know how  they kill a fucking,  like a,  what was it,  white tip,  uh,  white,  what was it?  Oh yeah,  like a white tail,  uh,  white tail.  Yeah,  yeah,  they just,  well they blow their  fucking,  you know,  heart out or their  necks or their brains.  I mean,  I don't give a fuck  about,  like,  elk.  Fuck elk.  Yeah.  Fuck fucking elk  and moose,  stupid mossy,  fucking antlers.  I just feel weird  after you kill something  and it's like still  all warm and shit  and you're like,  yeah.  But these guys,  you never see a deer,  they're so cute,  they're like looking up, 
[02:16:00]  they get the cute  little eyes  and then these guys  blow them fucking away.  And then drag the corpse  out of the woods  all day long.  Yeah,  it's fucking weird.  I gotta be creepy  for the hunters.  And it,  and it doesn't die  right away.  No,  I understand they dig it.  They run for like,  yeah,  50 more yards,  like nothing happened.  I've gutted,  uh,  uh,  like rabbits  and felt shit  still moving  while you gutting them  and that is like  the creepiest  goddamn thing.  That's gotta be.  You cut them open  and you pull their guts out 
[02:16:30]  and you feel like  the heart is still  kind of going  and muscles are twitching.  You're looking at  its little face.  It's little dead  rabbit face.  like,  uh,  yeah,  I just don't like  Let me,  uh,  let me get Royal Humpy  into the,  uh,  conversation.  Royal RH.  Hey guys,  what's going on?  What do you got,  Royal?  Um,  fly fishing is as close  to God as you will  ever get,  Hopi.  Why is that?  All right.  Calm down.  It's a insane amount  of skill.  I have,  Bobby's lucky  because Northeastern 
[02:17:00]  You've never fucked?  Yeah,  really.  That seems to be  a little closer to God  than fucking,  if you almost  get her pregnant.  That's the only way  you get close to God  fucking please  don't let it die.  It takes an insane  amount of skill.  Yeah.  To get fish  on a fly rod.  Anytime any of you  want to come out  to Wyoming  and try it,  open invitation.  The day I trudge  to Wyoming  to fly fish, 
[02:17:30]  fucking shoot.  When I go fishing  though,  you want to feel  some heaviness.  No,  you don't.  You want to  cast that motherfucker  out there  and reel it in.  Dude,  you fucking  stretch that line out  and you're whipping it  and you're looking  at this big,  huge line  whipping back  and you get that curl  and you want to  get it like way across  and the only way  you're going to get that  is if you get that cat  and you flip it,  snap it,  and it goes way across,  lands perfectly  on the water  where you wanted it  and you present the fly  like a real  fucking dead insect. 
[02:18:00]  You know what?  Let me tell you,  Opie made a great point.  I like going out  on a charter boat  way the fuck out  off Montauk.  I want a hook  that looks like  a grappling hook  connected to a fucking  weight that looks  like an anchor  and it goes  could splash  straight the fuck  down to the bottom.  You ever go  straight down  giant.  You ever go  flounder fishing  where you don't even  have to cast  and just drop  that motherfucker?  I want the hook  that was in the back  of Carbone's neck  in fucking Goodfellas.  I want something heavy. 
[02:18:30]  Opie's right.  Something heavy.  Heavy.  You ever go snagging?  What's snagging?  Like you see the blues  running right off the shore.  A lot of times  it's the bunker  which is what  the bait fish?  Yeah.  And you throw  that heavy lure in  with a lot of  fucking gnarly hooks  and you just have  to yank.  Just yank  and you're yanking.  You'll fucking  hook him in the side  or something about it.  Yeah, you'll hook him  in the side.  It's like, ow!  Right.  The mouth is open.  And then they give you  a fight, my friend.  That reel bends 
[02:19:00]  like you got  a hundred pound fish  on the line.  Dude, listen.  It's just you  in a fucking river.  Yeah, but you don't  hear any noise.  You hear the babbling brook.  You don't even hear  the noise of the sinker  hitting the water.  Can I use a sinker  if I fly fish?  You can.  Some do?  That's cheating though?  No.  Some, you gotta get  the big fish  on the bottom.  It's probably a BB.  Yeah, it is.  No, it is.  They tie a pellet.  A fucking 177 pellet  on the end of the hole.  Zeek!  Zeek!  They call it a nymph. 
[02:19:30]  A nymph.  You gotta match the hatch.  Have you ever  ripped the jaw  right out of the fish's  mouth?  No.  Set that hook.  Trying to get your hook back?  Set that hook  like a man, motherfucker.  The two fish that I dig,  the first two fish  that I caught  were...  They'll help you.  No, I hooked them  in the nose  on the outside.  Like, they went to bite it,  spit it out.  Oh, they were sniffing?  And I fucking just  snagged them in the nose.  Oh, shit.  I didn't even catch them  in the mouth.  In the mouth.  Dude, as soon as they  take the fly,  they spit it right out,  though. 
[02:20:00]  You have like a  balilla second.  They know that it ain't  a real fucking bug?  To pull up.  To yank?  Wow.  As soon as they grab it,  they grab it and spit it  right back out,  because they know  it's not real.  They went...  So you got like...  Bullshit!  Yeah, exactly.  They go...  Fuck it.  That's dog hair.  That's it.  It's like Steve  at a fucking glory hole.  I shouldn't do this.  I gotta go.  MJ, I'm getting married.  Babies.  I gotta go.  One more time.  No, I can't do it.  But it tastes so good.  I gotta go.  Then before you know it,  it's been there long enough  for a big shot of AIDS gum. 
[02:20:30]  And you're done for.  All right.  Royal Humpy,  I'm listening.  I'm not sure if I'm in yet  with this fly fishing, but...  Well, you said you wanted  to feel weight  at the end of the line, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  When we catch these  eight-pound rainbows,  cutthroats,  and brown trout  out in Wyoming,  it's a feeling like no weather.  There's plenty of weight  on the other end of the line.  And when you're fly fishing,  you get to feel  every little movement  the fish makes.  Yeah.  Depending on the rod,  like I was saying,  my uncle has a zero-weight rod, 
[02:21:00]  a little tiny fish  feels like a fucking...  What is a zero-weight?  ...a shark.  It's the weight.  I have a five-weight,  so it's a little bigger.  I could go and fish bass  and shit like that  if I wanted to.  But a zero-weight,  when you're fishing  like a little stream,  you cast it out.  You catch a little fish  because the rod's so small  and the line is so thin,  it feels like you get  a fucking jaws  on the end of it.  But, yeah.  But, dude,  you can literally,  if you're not a fly fish,  you know how you drive up  and you see a little river  going under a highway?  Just pull over 
[02:21:30]  and fucking go catch a fish.  You can't do that  with a bobber.  You got one of these rods  in your Vespa?  Oh, my Vespa  got hit by a con.  No way.  I can't.  Oh, no.  The white unicorn?  The white unicorn  got the fucking...  Thank you, Roy.  What happened?  Yeah, I came out...  So, you know,  I took it in...  I was...  Wait, it was parked, right?  I was selling it.  I was fucking selling it.  What?  You just got it.  What's wrong with you, Bobby?  I mean, make a decision  and stick with it.  You are a maniac.  Just stick with your decision. 
[02:22:00]  I'm a fucking addict  and it has nothing  to do with that.  But someone backed into it, right?  I just had a dad  for, like, more than five years  when I was growing up.  You're selling your Vespa.  You just bought it.  You wanted everyone  to get a Vespa.  I know.  Let me explain.  What about us going for a ride?  I was bringing it today.  I swear to God,  I was getting on it today  to come down here  and I had the helmet  and everything,  a little half shell for you.  I was going to put you  right on the back.  You'd hold my waist.  Yeah, okay.  That's going to happen.  Seriously,  and the best way  is if you put both of your fingers  into my belly button, 
[02:22:30]  your index fingers,  that actually is the best way  to hold on.  You won't fall off.  Sure, sure.  Plus, it tickles the tip  of my cock  for some reason  when you do that.  So what happened  to the Vespa?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Well, first of all,  the other night,  I bought it for my chick.  She wanted one mainly  and I was like,  fuck it, I'll use it too  because she wanted  to buzz around to work  and stuff.  Shut the fuck up.  No, seriously.  You were all about this thing.  No, I'm for it.  So at least admit,  you know what,  I thought it would be cool.  I just, yeah, absolutely.  I thought it would be cool.  I get it.  I'd buzz back to the shows  at night.  She'd take it to work 
[02:23:00]  in the day,  fucking whatever.  So I got her,  but I went in  and I got the 300.  All right,  most people in the city  have the 150.  I got sold on the 300  because I'm a fucking easy mark.  You know,  oh, you can take it  on the highway, can you?  I'm not going to take it  on the highway.  No, you can't.  I can do 90.  You're not doing 90  on a fucking Vespa.  No.  A fucking truck wind  hits you.  You start wobbling.  You're between a fucking Vespa  and a fucking Toyota.  You're going down.  But they sold me.  We could take it. 
[02:23:30]  We could go to fucking P.F. Chang's  in Jersey,  which we like to do,  but we,  so they sold me on that shit  and then it was a 2010  for $300 more.  You know,  it was 300 bucks more  for the 250 to the 300.  So,  and then he gave me a deal.  The guy at Johnny Bruno,  who's fucking really good guy.  Give me,  no,  he gave me a good deal.  The guy before him,  he saved me like 500 bucks.  The guy before  just bought the same bike.  He was walking out  touting fucking this much money  and then I was like,  I fucking saved this much,  asshole.  But,  she got on it to drive it 
[02:24:00]  and she can't fuck,  it's too heavy.  It's too fucking heavy.  There's such a difference  between a 150 and a 300.  She can't fucking,  her feet,  her tippy toes,  the seat's high,  it's a higher bike.  So,  she can't,  like,  I took her to drive it  and it's too powerful.  Like,  you know off,  you know when you get in a,  it's like a car.  Some cars,  you know,  it takes,  you can get up to 95  but it takes a half hour.  Yeah.  That's almost better  for a chick  to learn how to drive a scooter.  This one,  you know,  gets up real quick.  You know, 
[02:24:30]  you gun it a little bit,  you're fucking flying.  So,  she actually fell on the bike  the other night.  We were on some side street  and it fell over on her  and she hurt her knee  and I'm fucking  down on 26th Street  with a bunch of homeless people,  my chick crying,  a fucking vesper on her fucking shin.  You need the homeless guys  to help you get it off your chick.  Dude,  it was fucking,  and I'm just like,  I'm a mess.  So,  I went back the next day,  yesterday,  I was like,  dude,  how much,  I want to trade this in  and get the 150 for her  because I'm leaving.  I'm going on the road again.  Dane Cook tour,  it's 30, 
[02:25:00]  yeah,  I'm leaving next week.  Whoa,  whoa,  whoa,  really?  Yeah,  the second half,  another 30 something shows.  Across America?  Yeah,  we're going to Alaska,  bringing my fly fishing,  going up there to catch some cutthroat.  Jesus Christ,  listening.  I'm going to go catch a whale  and I'm just going to throw it in the ocean  and see what happens.  Dude,  that's awesome.  Honolulu,  fuck yeah.  Congrats,  but anyway,  so,  danecook.com for tickets,  ticket master.  There you go.  Anyways,  yeah,  so I brought it back to the guy  and I was,  I'm going to return it.  So we went through all these fucking options.  It actually, 
[02:25:30]  it would be cheaper for me  to buy a brand new bike,  have two bikes,  and then just sell the one I have.  Right.  Because you lose,  I don't know how this fucking works.  Yeah,  yeah,  well.  50%,  you lose,  I just bought it.  There's 100 miles on it,  not even,  okay?  Not a scratch on the fucking thing.  I added probably $1,000 of extra chrome  and fucking a new horn  that sounds like a fucking semi truck.  And they'll just give you fucking half.  Half.  Yeah,  half. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah,  they say as soon as you drive a new vehicle off the lot,  it drops immediately.  Fucking how?  Well,  it's just how it is.  What the fuck did I do?  How?  It's the same thing.  Just how it is.  I don't know.  You go on Craigslist  and the fucking guys are buying the same fucking thing  for the,  for six,  you know,  $7,000,  $6,000,  but you bring it back to the dealer.  You know,  were you going to buy it back for half?  Anyways,  he's a good guy though,  but,  so I was going to fucking,  this is what I was going to do.  I brought it back last night.  First of all,  he gave me a different seat to try.  It's,  it's the fucking,  it's a, 
[02:26:30]  it's tan ostrich.  What?  It looks like a black guy's shoe.  It's a lower seat so she can sit on it.  He said,  just try this for the night.  I'm like,  it's fucking tan ostrich.  Look like a fucking pimp shoe.  It's a white Vespa with a tan ostrich seat.  That's got a lot of fly,  yo.  I parked it up in front of the gym last night  in some fucking Puerto Rican.  Yo,  where'd you get that,  man?  I was like,  I liked it.  Fucking steal it.  Now,  where did it get hit though?  Right.  He put the seat on. 
[02:27:00]  I have this lock.  It goes right on the disc brake,  but if you touch the bike,  an alarm goes off.  Beep,  beep,  like in a car alarm.  You touch the fucking thing.  You sit on it.  You move the handlebars.  This thing fucking goes off.  It's loud as shit.  How do you turn it off though?  Every 15 seconds,  it shuts itself off.  Okay.  So,  and then it resets itself.  And if someone touches it again,  blah,  blah,  blah.  All right.  That's a good alarm.  It's fucking best thing ever.  Right?  So I did,  I was inside the seat.  So he put this new seat on.  It's jammed.  I can't,  I can't open the seat to put the alarm on.  First night, 
[02:27:30]  I've not put the alarm on.  Okay.  First night,  I've always put that fucking thing on.  Yeah.  And now it's jammed.  So I can't put it on.  So I walk out to come.  I was going to hop on it,  you know,  fucking come down here and fucking pick up my baby girl after the show.  I got to go to therapy after.  So right near your house,  I can drop you off up there.  That's exciting.  Stick your fucking index fingers in my belly button.  Hold on tight.  Maybe arrive,  but not that.  Just one.  No.  You can just,  how about you pinch my nipples back?  Do I have to lean forward?  No,  you have to hold on.  You have to lean with me. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  I don't want you fucking bobbling.  I had Joe DeRosa on it yesterday.  And his fucking,  and he was holding you.  He has nothing aerodynamic on his body.  It's,  it's,  he's just,  it's like a fucking,  just a hunk of ham on the back of a fucking bike.  He wasn't leaning or anything.  Dude,  he has no shoulders.  He's got some weird neck where all the meat on his shoulders were supposed to go.  Went to his neck,  his fat head.  He never fully developed in the womb.  He's flat.  He's just,  he's like a,  he's like a fucking meat sale. 
[02:28:30]  So,  he needed to be,  you know,  cooking a little longer.  Oh my God,  it was fucking awful.  It came out a little too early.  It was just awful.  Wait,  so he was holding on to you,  Bobby?  Yeah,  he actually,  he was uncomfortable too,  right at red light.  So guys actually have to put their arms around you?  He actually picked my shirt up at the red light and put his hands on bare skin.  What the fuck?  It's a creepy feeling.  Can't they have handles or something on the side where you just kind of hold on?  Some of them do.  I have,  yeah,  you can hold on,  but I took Colin home.  Colin's a fucking lunatic. 
[02:29:00]  I drove him home from the cellar on the fucking thing.  Are you shitting me?  He's covering my eyes.  We're doing,  we're doing 50 up 6th Ave.  He starts covering my eyes.  And then he starts head-butting me with his helmet because we can't get hurt.  So we're at a red light,  smashing each other's heads.  I'm,  I'm smashing him.  He's smashing me.  And he's just going fucking,  fucking,  fucking,  it doesn't even hurt.  Then he grabbed the steering wheel.  He grabbed one side of the,  steering wheel.  I mean,  well, 
[02:29:30]  handlebars.  What are you going to do?  I'm not a fuck.  Steering wheel.  You better sell this fucking thing.  Oh,  this one comes with the steering wheel.  Yeah,  right.  So how did it get hit?  Yeah,  I want to know how it got hit.  Explain that.  I come out this morning and it was just lying there like a fat chick at a,  the day after a good party.  I was on its side.  Oh no.  On its side.  Because you know what?  Us car drivers.  Fucking.  We don't notice the motorcycles and the Vespas parked behind us.  And you just back out of your spot and you're knocking this shit over all the time.  Gotta have the rear can.  I parked in front of a car right at the, 
[02:30:00]  uh,  no parking zone.  So I was the last,  you can't,  you couldn't park in front of me.  Somebody pulled in and just smashed into it.  Because you don't see those things.  I'm telling you,  that's a major problem here in New York.  You see them almost,  almost every day.  You see one that's damaged.  How many Vespas have you smashed into?  Me personally?  Yes.  I,  I smashed a motorcycle once to be honest with you.  You did?  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  Did you leave?  Yes.  You just left?  Yes.  Did it tip over?  No.  So you just smashed it?  Did you damage it? 
[02:30:30]  Yes.  And you left?  Yes.  Why wouldn't you fucking,  you got insurance?  Because I'm a human being.  That's what,  that's what happens.  What the fuck does that mean?  We leave the scene.  No.  You want me to make believe I didn't?  You have insurance.  Good for me.  And then it goes up.  I don't need the,  I don't,  I don't need the problem.  Because I'm a human being,  you leave the scene.  You just,  you want to go to the phones?  Nine out of 10 people would,  would say they leave the scene.  If no one's around.  Yeah.  Well,  no,  I backed into the guy,  I did a little damage.  I'm like,  oh,  motherfucker.  I had somewhere to go.  I don't remember anymore. 
[02:31:00]  And I,  I took off.  Yeah,  I did.  I agree with you.  I was at the cell the other night  and I'm trying to get up,  you know,  in the front of the cellar.  I was trying to put the bike up on the curb  instead of parking it on the street.  And there was a 10 speed attached to the,  uh,  fucking street sign.  So,  but the,  if you're down,  down in the village,  the curbs are,  uh,  the,  the corners are steel.  Yeah.  It's made out of fucking steel.  So I tried to hop up on the thing  and my,  the back tire just skidded on the steel.  Oh,  and I'm,  and I panicked and gunned it 
[02:31:30]  and ran over this guy's 10 speed.  I just,  but it was chained to the pole.  So I just smashed it  and I gunned it.  I don't know why that is.  That's like a fucking,  if you panic on a bike for some reason,  you just fucking gun it.  Thinking you just plow,  I don't know,  plow through it and get out of there.  Dude,  all's I heard from the people.  What,  what are you doing?  Like,  it looks like I meant to do it.  Yeah.  Like I just like,  fuck this.  So I did leave.  I want to know what type of damage  was sustained on your scooter. 
[02:32:00]  The,  the front fender,  the actual,  uh,  the corn of the unicorn,  you might say.  Yeah.  The,  uh,  the horn.  Yeah.  The front fender was cracked  and knocked off.  So someone hit that  and blue paint,  blue paint.  I wish I was monk.  I'd fucking just solve this.  I just,  and you thought that someone  should leave a little note.  We,  we just don't.  You didn't let a fucking note.  You got insurance.  I got insurance.  You fucking savage.  You just fucked up someone's bike  after you gave me a,  uh,  uh,  a talking to.  It's a 10 speed. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Good for,  I bet you that 10 speed  would probably cost more  than the dumb bike I hit.  You don't think he's going to go  fucking steal another one  to deliver some fucking Chinese food?  Exactly.  Let me say hi to Justin  in Oklahoma.  Justin.  Good evening.  Hey Justin.  Hey.  Hey,  my wife and I just brought  a brand new,  uh,  09 Dodge Vendor,  bright red.  And,  uh,  we're at the mall  and she lets the door go  and it just smashes  into a black BMW  and puts the red  and a dent  right in the side of it.  And I said,  shut that fucking door 
[02:33:00]  and let's go.  I fucking hate that  more than I would  if you were rolling  and hit something.  You know what it is?  If you're rolling,  and something happens,  there's a lot of things  that could go on.  Distractions,  you don't see a motorcycle,  uh,  you,  you,  you misjudge  turning in somewhere,  whatever.  That fucking door,  and I gotta tell you,  it's usually women,  I'm sorry,  they fling that fucking door open  with complete disregard  to what's next to them,  how long the door is, 
[02:33:30]  how much room they got,  and pow,  right into the fucking  side of your,  your car.  And,  and meanwhile,  you know,  they could be driving  a piece of shit  and you have,  uh,  a nice vehicle  and now you got a,  a big ding in your door.  Happens all the time.  I hate that.  That's why when I get a new car,  I take a hammer to the hood  immediately,  get the first ding out of the way.  Crazy.  Makes your life a lot easier,  I'm telling you.  A little nuts.  You hit,  well,  maybe not the hood.  Maybe not the hood.  Yeah,  you put the first mark in it.  For real.  You smash your own car? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah,  you put the first ding in  and then you don't have to worry as much.  You should see Kenny.  Kenny drives me home every day,  he examines his car with,  with a,  with a magnifying glass,  basically.  He's obsessed with keeping that,  that brand new car,  his ding free.  It's impossible if you live in the city.  Wow,  he's gonna get nailed one day  and be really pissed off.  He's already got nailed a few times.  Oh,  did he?  Yeah,  his car was outside during a hailstorm  a month after he got his car.  It looks like a golf ball.  For real,  it's all marked up where they have to fix it. 
[02:34:30]  Oh.  For real.  He's got a little like,  I think it's like weird,  like,  almost pink marks.  All the spots that need to be fixed.  That need to be fixed.  From the hailstorm hitting it.  Poor little feller.  Yep.  Here's another guy.  Let's go to Charlie in Staten Island.  Charlie.  Good morning.  Hey.  On my first accident,  I backed up into the elderly couple  that lived on the block  and I took off.  And then I got about two minutes away  and I realized  my best friend lives there.  I'm on the block five times a day. 
[02:35:00]  So I drove back,  told him that I forgot my license,  went home to get it.  Were they in a car  or just hit elderly people?  Your first reaction is to run.  It really is.  It's not the right thing,  I guess,  but...  Hey,  Anthony.  Who needs to hassle?  What?  The fly fishermen  are like the sailboaters  of the boating world.  Oh,  I hear you.  Yep.  You want a fucking motor?  Yes,  I want a motor.  Yeah,  exactly. 
[02:35:30]  You guys are the sailboaters.  Yeah,  we're fucking sophisticated.  Yeah,  fucking sophistication.  Bang chicks on the fucking top  with champagne  and grapes  and cheese.  fly fishermen  are not known  for their sexual prowess.  Don't give me that shit.  Don't make it sound like  having waders on  and fingers that smell like trout  is going to get you  fucking broads.  Same thing that happens  at your fucking house  on weekends.  Come on.  I'm true.  I don't know.  Maybe if you take me fly fishing.  I guess I'm not getting  the best of the ride,  but maybe we'll do some fly fishing. 
[02:36:00]  I will take you fly fishing  in two weeks.  How far do I have to go?  Hour and a half.  I can handle that.  Hour and a half.  Hour and a half.  I'm not wearing the outfit  like I see in your dumb video.  You got to.  You got to.  Listen to me.  No outfit.  Listen to me.  Take pictures.  No outfit.  Listen to me.  I'll roll up my stupid jeans  and I'll walk in the dump stream  and I'll catch a trout.  You get waist high waders then.  You throw them right over your jeans.  Yeah.  Yeah, waist high.  Why?  It just feels good  sloshing around.  You got to be in the water, dude.  I'm going to be in the water.  Because you get a cast 
[02:36:30]  and the thing goes  you can't be on the tree line  and you're stuck in a fucking tree.  No, if you wear shorts  I'm not good.  It's gayer than waders.  Is it?  What are you going to wear?  Fucking workout shorts?  Like Reebok tight  to your crotch shorts?  A little denim vest.  With a mesh ball sack holder?  Wow, you're taking it  a little too far.  I mean, I just got a pair  of nice shorts I like.  All of a sudden  your balls are hanging out  in mesh.  In mesh.  What the fuck, Bobby?  Well, that's a hell  of an imagination  that you just reached for.  Catch a trout with your ass. 
[02:37:00]  Well, that's not based  on anything you've seen  in the past.  Did you see Opie  ripping down his shorts  downstream  letting trout fucking  go right into his mesh  little net?  Got a nice little  pair of shorts  that I want to wear.  Listen.  No mesh for my balls.  You gotta go in the water.  You have to.  That's the whole part of it.  I'll roll up my fucking jeans.  How cold is the water?  It's not fucking 1920s.  You go in the,  you get waders.  You can go in.  I'm not buying an outfit  to go fly fishing once.  You don't have to buy the outfit. 
[02:37:30]  You can rent the outfit.  Ah, rent one.  Rent.  That should smell good.  Well, rent, it's,  well, you know,  put it on,  what are you,  fuck, what's wrong with you?  Are you obsessed?  It's going to stink anyway.  I'm boxing at the gym  and I finally had to  buy my own gloves  because I was putting on  the gloves that they  provide at the gym.  Oh, dear God.  Yeah.  We should bring those in  to have you smell.  Ugh.  Dear fucking God.  Is it bad?  Holy shit.  Is it bad?  After you wash  and scrub your hands,  you can still smell  someone else's sweat.  Is that what I'm supposed to wear? 
[02:38:00]  That's what you're going to wear.  That's the fly fishing outfit?  That's an oldie time bathing suit  where the guy is wearing the stripes  and his junk is hanging down.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll put you in that.  That'll be good.  Yeah.  That's more,  that's so offensive  because  That really is.  You can see  you can see his cock and balls  but back then it was like  oh, don't show too much skin.  Yeah, don't wear shorts  because you don't want  to expose your top.  Right.  Meanwhile, the guy's cock  is fucking sticking out.  Did you see the outline  of the helmet?  They didn't figure out 
[02:38:30]  how to give you  a little space down below.  Alright, so where do we fly fish?  We're going to  we'll go up to  Roscoe, New York  right off  17, old 17.  I don't know Roscoe  from my days  you know, going back  to western New York.  That was a stopover.  Roscoe's Diner.  Well, exactly.  You're right.  How far is the fly fishing  from Roscoe's Diner?  Right there.  You walk in.  Right there?  Right there.  You walk right into any river.  Any river up there  you can stop  and just get  You're walking into  rivers like that.  What?  It's the clean  what are you acting like? 
[02:39:00]  It's not the Hudson.  Cold and fucking  He doesn't like nature.  I like a little nature.  I don't want to be in a river.  Little nature.  Why?  You see wild animals  when you're fly fishing?  Oh fuck dude  an otter  came  I scared  Listen to me  I was on the rock  I looked over  I saw this huge  little  You should just go back  to doing drugs  and banging  whatever the fuck  I know right?

[03:00:30]  Oh, fucking blood  Very  Very difficult  When the temperature's going down  To, you know  The lower 50s  To keep the pool up  In the 90 degree mark  Tell Bobby what your electric bill was  The pool in the 90 degrees  Yeah  He keeps it, I think  93, you said?  Everyone makes fun of me  Until they come over the house  And jump in that fucking pool  90 degrees?

[03:01:30]  You don't have to keep adding in stupid chlorine  I had no fucking idea  Things like that  I think it makes it impossible  To actually over  If you want to quote unquote chlorinate  So you don't get any of that smell  It's not, you know, irritating in any way  The smell doesn't turn your hair green  It doesn't fucking bleach out your clothes or anything  Does it feel like just more refreshing too?  It's nice, yeah  You know when you get out of a chlorine pool  And you're all dusty  Yeah, yeah  The big tablets you put in the skimmer  Kaplonk  Now you can't go in for five hours  I've just shocked it

Danny all of a sudden  Is putting a thumb up  So I assume it's Danny  Took scissors  And cut his underwear off  And then he went to the pool naked  Was it like a groundbreaking ceremony?  At that point there were  A couple of girls there  There were a few girls there  And Bobo was making them  You know, a little uncomfortable  With his stupid half a rod  Oh, I heard about that  I heard it's crazy

It's fake  It's fake  Repos of cars 
[03:42:00]  It's all the staged  Fucking repossession  Of your car show  It's so fucked up  How television  You know  There's nothing to wonder anymore  How it's made  You know how  I know how fucking  Peaches  Get to a fucking  Destination now  You know what's  Fucked up though?  No  Just last night  Yes sir  Right before I fell asleep  I was pondering  How the fuck  Does a sewing machine work?  I swear to god  You can find out  I was like  I know  And I was too tired  And I was like  Just on the brink of sleep  Or I would have looked it up  But 
[03:42:30]  And it was late and shit  But how does the needle  Go in through the top  And I know there's the bobbin  On the bottom  But you can't just have a needle  Pushing thread through  There's gotta be something  That holds the loop of thread  From pulling out  On the bottom  And that's where the bobbin thread  Comes from  But like  How does it go through  That fucking  And then back through  And back  I have no fucking idea  There's a show called  Deconstructed  It's pretty cool  It's annoying me  It's like how it's made in reverse  Yeah  But  But I think they actually 
[03:43:00]  Had a sewing machine  Or I vaguely remember  Something about a sewing machine  I'd love to pull it up for you  But my computer has frozen  For the same thing  You don't know how things  Are made though Bobby  You've seen all the shows  But as soon as you  As soon as you  Stopped watching  You forgot already  That's what sucks about me and you  I can't retain shit  But there are people  Who do retain shit  Like fucking  Yeah  Fucking scientist  Fucking wizard  Once I know it  I know it  When you get into one of those  How it's made marathons  You're done for the day  Yeah  It's fucking fascinating  It's the dumbest shit ever  But it's insane 
[03:43:30]  It really is  The shit that  There's nothing left  There's nothing to wonder about on TV  You get depressed  When all of a sudden  They go to a Matlock  You know  Rerun  Because they ran out of shows  It's like shit man  I know I hate that  That's so frustrating  There's one channel  One more  One more  Fuck  It does cold case files  And then all of a sudden  It turns into CSI  Yeah some gypsum  It's like well Frank  This looks like a case of  Do you  Who did who  Yeah  What's the best show on TV right now 
[03:44:00]  Oh it's fucking dude  What new episodes  You don't understand  There's different shows though  I mean you're talking TV shows  Are you talking the A&E type show  Just a show you can't miss  Every week  True Blood  Yeah a lot of people talk about True Blood  I fucking love that show  I heard Weeds isn't as good  I can't get into Weeds anymore  I heard there's a little drop off with the Weeds  Yeah True Blood's great  And then you got  You know what I love  Fucking Ghost Adventures  Gotta go with Lost  Have you seen that  But it's not on yet 
[03:44:30]  No  Ghost Adventures  You know all the shows  Where the people  They have these fucking groups of people  Like Paranormal State  It's that fucking kid from Penn State  And a bunch of other students  Fat chicks with zits  And stupid cowboy hats  Going to places  The actual Ghost Adventures  Is  Three guys  One guy's jacked  He's fucking jacked  The other guy  Is a fucking chunky  Fucking camera guy  That's scared shit of everything  And this other guy  And they go in 
[03:45:00]  They get locked into a fucking scary place  They lock them in  They have cameras  That's it  With night vision  No lights  And that's it  And there's no crew  All the other shows have crews behind them  You know  He kind of takes you out of it  When you know there's a camera guy  And a sound guy  They don't do that shit  It's just them  With three cameras  Night vision  They get locked in  But this guy Zack  Is like a fucking  He's like a lunatic  So he taunts the ghosts  Like all the other shows  He's like  You want to come out  Come out  Attack me  Fuck let's go 
[03:45:30]  And then the ghosts  Attack him  Supposedly  Do you believe in it?  I believe in ghosts  Abso-fucking-lutely  I think I might believe in ghosts  Of course you do  No  Yes you do  I'm not really sure  You don't believe in ghosts  Because you can't shoot them  You don't believe in ghosts  But would you hang out  In one of these weird  Fucking ghosty places  In the middle of the night  With no fucking lights  I'm not saying  It's not scary  That would scare the shit out of me  I'm not saying it's not scary  But why would it be scary?  They say the comedy store in LA  I mean you go down that basement  I think it's the basement  They're like  Not many  There's not many brave guys  That deal with that well 
[03:46:00]  I heard about that  It just feels scary as shit  It's scary  But here's the problem  With the ghost that shows  And I can't stand  The trailers for them  Or the you know  Previews or whatever  They always show like  They're walking around  With the night vision  And their eyes are glowing  And they go  I saw something  What was that?  Oh!  And then you watch the show  And the guy going  Oh!  Is like  Oh!  Why didn't you bring  The flashlight?  Right, right, right  Like they cut it in though  To make it look  Like it's exciting  They gotta make good TV 
[03:46:30]  And how many more shows  Can you get  Where there's manly men  Beating each other up  And pissed at each other  On the job  Now they got the  Fucking oil rig one  Where  Everyone seems to be  Getting hurt  You gotta give it a chance  Everyone's getting hurt  Because no one's  Fucking doing anything  But fighting  They're just always fighting  Yeah, but they get  They get killed  On that fucking job  Because they're always  Fucking fighting  With each other  It's not like that  Stupid axe men  Where a fucking timber  And they  But that's another one  Where they go  The tree's coming down 
[03:47:00]  Whoa!  Whoa!  Give me the axe!  You see that new one  It's like deadly as catch  But instead of crab fishing  It's sword fishing  And it's just called swords  It's the same show  It's the same show  Same show  That's fucking  Same show  Those boats are small  And they're in the fucking  That's from  The Perfect Storm  That's those guys  That's exactly  The Andrea Gale  Those are the same people  How do you remember that?  Well, not the same people  They're dead  My brother  I read the book  And saw the movie  And I couldn't tell you  The name of the fucking boat  He's fucking out of his mind  That's serious  He really is  We should just call him  Google Ant
