<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a nonsensical segment before transitioning to Anthony's online poker struggles and upcoming World Poker Tour Invitational in Los Angeles.  They brainstormed a gimmick for the tournament, and received advice from a caller, Chex, a 27-year-old professional online poker player, recommending tournament play over cash games and specific online platforms.  Opie then complained about his intern, Jimmy, and launched into a graphic description of his bowel problems.

The show then featured a sexually suggestive phone call with Canadian truck drivers Larry and Jolie, involving vulgar language, a description of a tongue vibrator, and a “Guess What’s in My Pants” game while Jolie was reportedly naked.  Her husband unexpectedly called in, creating a tense but humorous exchange.  The Christo art installation in Central Park was discussed, with Big Kev, a regular caller, contributing his perspective.  Drew Boogie, a DJ, provided live scratching throughout.  A Valentine's Day ad for Vermont Teddy Bears was also aired.

This was followed by a segment featuring in-studio guests Drew Boogie, Keith (a police officer), and Martini Steve.  The discussion centered on Keith's experience being mistaken for a sex worker while on duty, followed by an exploration of the demise of Panzerfaust Records, a white supremacist record label, due to a co-founder's Hispanic heritage.  Several offensive Panzerfaust songs were played.  Callers David (from Dallas) and Joe (from Boston) added to the discussion, with Joe reporting an “O&A Shit Dick” sign at the Patriots' Super Bowl parade, leading to another offensive Panzerfaust song.  A heated exchange with frequent caller Lady Di, focusing on her unemployment, dominated a significant portion of the show, punctuated by calls from listeners offering jobs she hadn’t pursued.  Marion also called in for her birthday, leading to a discussion about her sex life.  The segment concluded with discussions about Jay Moore's on-air profanity during a Super Bowl event, Jason Giambi's steroid confession, and Jose Canseco's book.

A subsequent segment focused on Giambi's steroid scandal and the excessive security at the XM radio studios, particularly Joey Paisano's 40-minute security check-in.  The hosts criticized the stringent security measures, including the collection of social security numbers, and argued with studio security personnel (“Master Poe”) on air. The segment included audio clips of Giambi, Earl Weaver, and Corey Feldman, as well as a musical parody.  Joey Paisano and Drew Boogie were in studio.  Humorous and often offensive commentary on the Christo art installation continued.

Another chaotic segment opened with Opie and Anthony discussing their perceived lack of safety walking to work.  This transitioned into another Vermont Teddy Bears ad,  Drew Boogie promoting his comedy shows, and Martini Steve’s behind-the-scenes radio promo blunder that sounded like he was assaulting his mother, followed by a call from his mother suggesting Jim Norton's comedy show.  A “Milk Diva” promo showcasing Opie's milk obsession was introduced.  A trucker, Dwayne, called in discussing negative racial stereotypes, broadening the discussion to societal impacts of stereotypes.  Clips of on-air television mishaps, including a news anchor struggling with Melania Trump's name and a tense pre-broadcast exchange between news anchors, were played. A worker from Christo's "The Gates" installation called in, and a caller shared a wormhole theory and recounted her Navy experience.  Crude humor and profanity were prevalent.

A female caller's military service and subsequent McDonald's employment became the focus of relentless mocking and vulgar insults from the hosts. The conversation jumped between unrelated topics: Michael Jackson, Corey Feldman, Kim Jong-il, Prince Charles, Giambi's steroid use, the Pope's health, Hamas attacks, and the sinking of the Achille Lauro (with the Leon Klinghoffer comment).  Drew Boogie was present as the DJ.  A “What Did We Learn?” segment followed, featuring callers sharing absurd observations and plugs for various businesses and individuals, including Jim Norton and Joey Paisano.  The show ended with Drew Boogie's outro.

[00:04:30]  How did you see that jerk?  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it. Crawl around like a dog.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared. 
[00:05:00]  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  Where is that private pile?  Sorry, jelly's on it, sir.  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  You're a phony.  Hey, hey, this guy's a great big phony. 
[00:05:30]  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony.  Uh-oh.  Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.  Put a sock in the boy, or else you'll be out of here like shit through a goose.  Good morning and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[00:06:00]  Morning.  We call it a virus, the O.N.A. virus, spreading across America.  Good morning, Mr. Breakfast.  How's everyone today?  Ah, a little more awake?  Little.  I'm a little beat.  Playing online poker last night.  I dropped 300 bucks.  300 bucks.  See, it's slowly but surely becoming a problem with you.  Yeah, could be.  Just like I told you.  Could be.  Could be.  You were just fooling around, toying with it a little bit. 
[00:06:30]  But you're...  I'm starting to notice some things, Anthony.  I gotta practice.  Right after the show, you jumped right back on, and you're starting to play more and more  and more and more and more.  I'm practicing.  How many hours are you practicing a day?  How many...  Am I awake?  Really?  That I'm not doing this program.  And I do have a computer here, but I've chosen so far not to play during the show.  And we greatly appreciate that, Anthony.  We don't want you to go back to your old ways.  When I was stopped trading.  Yeah, yeah.  Your day trading during the radio show is just legendary. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Made a lot of money back then.  Yeah, that's right.  You are practicing.  You're doing the World Poker Tour Invitational on February 23rd and 24th in La La Land.  That's right.  Going to Los Angeles.  You know, I'm going to be playing with the pros and some celebrities that are pretty good  at playing poker.  So, yeah, I've been brushing up, but I don't know what happened.  I fell apart last night.  I fell apart.  I dropped 300 bucks in a matter of, like, no time at all.  And I'd been doing very well, you know, building up the bankroll. 
[00:07:30]  What do you mean by building up the bankroll?  I started out, I just deposited, like, 200 bucks in my account.  Yeah.  And I brought it up to 600.  And then last night, just lost half of it.  300 bucks, right down to toity.  The flushes were coming out like crazy, and not for me either.  Like, I'd have a good hand, you know.  Have a set.  And all of a sudden, bam, there's that flush.  And you can't always be afraid to bet against the flush, you know.  You see three suited cards laying out there, and you're like, all right, someone might 
[00:08:00]  have it, but Jesus Christ, every other hand, boom, boom, nailed.  And I'm betting big, you know.  That's because they're using cheat codes.  No.  I don't trust that online video poker thing, man.  I just don't trust it.  It's reputable.  Are they reputable?  I know why you're losing so much you don't have your gimmick yet.  I need my gimmick.  I think I'm just going to be a loud guy, because that's what I am at home. 
[00:08:30]  Can I maybe bring a mouse with me, so that when something bad happens, I can just go,  Son of a bitch!  And slam it down on the desk, on the table, like I do at home.  Can I just take my mouse?  I think I'm on my fifth mouse.  When I see those cards turn over, and I realize I've just been screwed again, that mouse gets  slammed down.  Son of a bitch!  You could just be asshole guy.  I don't know.  We're trying to find a gimmick for Anthony when he does the poker thing out there in L.A. 
[00:09:00]  Let's say how to Chex.  Yeah, what's up?  That's really your name, Chex?  Well, it's my nickname.  Right on.  What's up, Chex?  I kind of play online poker for a living.  I thought Ant might, could use a little advice, you know.  For a living, huh?  Yeah.  You don't do anything else?  This pays your rent?  Pretty much, yeah.  Wow.  How old are you?  I'm 27.  27, and you figured out that you could do this for a living?  Yeah, well, I mean, I've been playing poker since I was a little kid. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Well, how much are you bringing in a year?  I made a little over $60,000 last year.  Wow.  Just online, playing poker.  Well, I mean, I play at Foxwoods sometimes.  Yeah.  Some of these guys do actually make a living off of it.  Do you have better luck at Foxwoods or online?  I do okay at Foxwoods, but I play a lot more online.  Could you hold on a minute?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:10:00]  Speaking of gambling, this intern's gambling with his life, handing Jimmy that.  What is this?  What is it?  I never have ice, ever, medium iced latte with fat-free milk.  Please throw it at him.  Oh, Jesus.  I saw him outside.  What time did I get here?  Like 5.30 or so.  So, see, 40 minutes, 45 minutes ago.  Yeah.  At 5.25 on the way out.  He's like, hey, what do you want?  I'm like, I'll medium iced latte.  And you haven't gone for 45 minutes, and you come back with this. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, hold on.  Please dump it over his head in front of everybody and make him feel silly.  I just want a medium iced latte with fat.  All you want, Jimmy.  Get that for yourself, and it's on me.  It's all for me.  No problem.  What?  Want me to just correct that?  Just go down there and get it on me?  It's no problem.  You want me to correct that?  No, no, no.  I'll just drink something I don't want.  Of course I want you to correct it.  Of course that coffee should be corrected. 
[00:11:00]  Perhaps a bit more.  But did you hear him?  It's going to be on him.  Oh, thank you.  Appreciate that.  Dude, the guy makes no money.  He's just an intern.  Very nice of him.  He tried to give me an iced coffee.  Like $2.30.  Like, not even.  Like, $2.  All right.  You don't need it to the send.  Relax.  $2.30 is close enough.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Medium iced latte with fat-free milk.  Please.  The love of God, please. 
[00:11:30]  Write it down.  Oh, my goodness.  Write it down.  All right.  Listen, we're...  And two Splendors.  I've never had one of these in my life.  No.  It's the sugar substitute.  Why are you throwing anything?  Why would Jimmy eat sugar substitute?  It's awful.  I know.  My face uses a toilet.  All of a sudden, no, no.  Sugar's a no-no in my diet.  And there it goes.  There it is.  In Jimmy's garbage pail.  Thank God that garbage pail is close to Jimmy.  Because your order is constantly getting screwed.  Dude, I'm the easiest.  I eat the same thing every day.  I understand. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  Listen.  So, Chex.  Yeah.  I don't know if you answered the question.  Do you have better luck at Foxborough?  Foxborough.  Fox...  Foxwoods.  Sorry.  Foxborough.  All right.  Relax, Ben.  Ben put his hand up in the air and went, whoo, when you said Foxborough.  What a complete tool.  Foxwoods or online?  I probably do better per hour at Foxwoods, but I play a lot more online, so.  I didn't know you could make money doing this, Anthony.  Some people do.  Some people, these professionals, especially the ones you see on TV, on the poker tournaments 
[00:12:30]  and stuff, that's all they do.  They play poker.  And it supports their life.  And pretty good living from a lot of the behind-the-scenes stuff they've shown to these  people at home and with their families.  They're doing fine.  You have any advice for Anthony?  Well, yeah.  First of all, are you playing the cash games, Ant?  Yes, sir.  Yeah, I see.  You need to play the tournaments.  You do a lot better at the tournaments.  That's what I hear.  Yeah, if you're going to do the practice, they have the sit-and-go tables. 
[00:13:00]  You play those.  Those are pretty good practice for the tourneys.  For the tournaments, yeah?  Yeah.  I'll try.  I was thinking about that, but a lot of them start up.  Up at, what, like 8 o'clock or something, and I'm ready to go to bed.  Well, no.  What they have, you go to the first, you play on party poker?  Uh-oh.  It sounds like you play on the kids.  Uh-oh.  You sit at the kids' table.  Here it comes.  That's exactly where you play.  Yes, sir.  Why?  Where do you play? 
[00:13:30]  I would recommend a few other sites.  Party poker is just kind of, I mean, I don't really want to bash them over the air,  but it's not really the best environment to learn in.  Probably a lot of rookies.  Well, I'm not learning.  It's not like I'm, you know, I'm a rookie here, and I've been playing for, you know,  over a year, but, you know, so it's not like I just stepped into it.  Well, I mean, the games of party poker don't really represent what you're going to find  at a regular tournament.  That I've noticed.  There's a lot of jerk-offs in there that really don't play very well. 
[00:14:00]  You've got to sit there with them.  Yeah, you've got to try PokerStars.  They're a lot better.  Oh, I'll try that.  Why not deposit more money in another poker account?  Jesus.  All right.  Well, what you do, see, you play the sit-and-go tables, and it's just, it's an open table with,  like, a nine-seeded table, and as soon as, you know, nine guys sit down, they start another  one, and you just play, you know, almost like a satellite.  All right.  All right.  Thanks for the advice, Chex. 
[00:14:30]  No problem.  All right.  I can give Ben my name off, you know, off the air at the end if you want to look for  me on that site.  I'd help you out in person there.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  There goes Chex.  Let's go to the gym real fast.  This poker thing's just taking over the world, man.  Oh, yeah.  This article's getting written about parents very nervous about their high school kids and  their junior high kids, because now that's all they're doing.  They're just sleeping over friends' houses and just playing poker all weekend long.  Online gambling used to be for the, you know, very sleazy crowd. 
[00:15:00]  It was something not everybody really did.  You weren't sure how reputable it was or getting your money into the account or out of it or  something like that.  But nowadays, man, yeah, everyone's doing it.  A lot of people that probably shouldn't be doing it, like you said, people in school,  underage.  It's, you know, you log right on, and there you are.  You're playing cards for money.  Jim, what's going on, buddy?  Hello.  Hey, Jim, let's go.  Hey, I want to tell them, you really are, you really need to play with people. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, no, I know that.  Because you don't learn the game.  Well, you learn the game.  You don't learn the mannerisms of people.  You can watch it all day on TV, but you can't, you know, you can't, you got to learn the  mannerisms of people to be, you know, it's going to be in a tournament or whatever.  Right, there's a whole other part of the game, and that's dealing with the actual people  around the table.  Yeah, I know that.  All right.  Well, you know, the fact is, it's going to get knocked out very early. 
[00:16:00]  I'm expecting a trouncing, but what the hell?  We're going out to L.A. so Anthony can lose, you know, pretty much right off the bat, and  then we're going to have a nice vacation.  There you go, and then we're going to hang out in Los Angeles for a while.  Sure, why not?  All right, well, we've got lots to do on the program today.  I woke up at 2 this morning, Anthony.  2?  I was telling you this story on the way in.  It's pretty gross, isn't it?  Yeah, a little disgusting.  Well, as you know, I'm having problems dumping. 
[00:16:30]  I used to be the most regular guy on earth.  I used to be the three-dump kid.  When I was waking up like a normal human being, I would wake up, dump three times within 15  minutes, done for the day.  What?  Thanks for coming.  It's as simple as that.  Now I'll go two, two and a half days without dumping.  That's a problem.  And then my headache, I get a headache because you've got the toxins in you.  It's just a nightmare.  Have you gotten the pipe yet?  Maybe you've got some blockage.  You think I've got some big blockage in there? 
[00:17:00]  Maybe you need the pipe.  Yeah, I know I'm going to go see my doctor, but...  Uh-oh, then he'll definitely...  Well...  Oh, dude.  We all have to face the pipe someday.  Get colonics, man.  They work.  I've done them.  When they put the water in, they shoot it up, it clears you right out.  You know something?  It's so different when he talks about it.  Yeah, I know.  When Jimmy talks about stuff like this, it just comes off as some sexual thing that goes  there, pays the doctor.  He's probably jacking it as he's getting the colonics.  It's a total medical environment. 
[00:17:30]  There's nothing sexual about it.  And when the doc starts, Jimmy just starts scrapping.  Could you yell at me while you do it?  Excuse me, sir?  Just holler at me a little.  No, man.  It's good.  It'll help you.  I'm telling you.  No, I've really got to figure this out.  Because my latest strategy backfired horribly.  Backfired?  What, do you keep sparing yourself?  No, I just...  I decided to try a laxative, an oral laxative. 
[00:18:00]  People get addicted to those.  Why would you ever get addicted to the laxative thing?  Because the more you use it, the more you need it.  And you won't be able to dump without taking it.  No, this is a...  I tried it and that's it.  That's it?  So, they said, you know, I don't know, take the laxative like 10 hours before you want  to dump.  So, I was trying to figure out...  10 hours?  Something like that.  Because it was like a minor laxative.  Do we ever have 10 hours in a day?  Well, so I took it around 6 o'clock last night. 
[00:18:30]  I think, you know, around 4 when I wake up, I'm ready to rock and roll.  Wow, that's risky, man.  You've got business to tend to.  You've got a show to come to.  Trust me, it's very risky because I'm sitting here right now percolating.  My stomach is like an old creaky door.  You'll lay there.  Those awful creaking noises.  So, if I have to run out of the studio, you know why. 
[00:19:00]  But, I mean, if you want to hear something really gross, I got the grossest thing, man.  I'm laying in bed and I just told you, I woke up at 2 o'clock.  Know why I woke up at 2 o'clock?  I was farting so bad and it stunk so bad.  Woke you up out of a sound sleep.  It smelled like ammonia.  And rotting peanuts.  Oh, God.  Tripped down the old Jersey turnpike.  Even Jimmy's giving the ugh.  The only time I know you're so backed up, there are probably like 4-week-old logs in there 
[00:19:30]  just festering and rotting.  Dude, because all of a sudden I wake up from a sound sleep.  It's 2 o'clock in the morning and, you know, you wake up going,  wow, it just woke me up.  And you're all, like, dazed and confused.  I'm thinking, was it the homeless guy?  I'm listening.  No homeless guy.  Is it the garbage trucks?  Wow, it's actually very quiet.  Is it the neighbors upstairs?  No, they're fast asleep.  And then it finally hits me.  I'm like, holy moly.  It was awful.  It woke me up from a sound sleep. 
[00:20:00]  They were so bad.  Absolutely so bad.  And then I woke up at 4 and just the floodgates opened.  The gas chamber.  Get a colonic and I'll help you.  All right, I'm going to try that next.  I'll try everything.  It's an 8-step treatment.  You have to go like 8 times.  I am.  I'm not doing 8 steps.  No, it gets in.  They clean out.  Like, the water goes in.  They have all these weird things you take.  But it's great.  It's really helpful.  8 steps.  Wait, you've got to go back 8 times?  Yeah.  I mean, if you don't have to.  I only went for 3. 
[00:20:30]  But it helped me dump more normal and better after.  I'm telling you.  Not to be.  I'm not trying to be nasty.  But it used to be a mess.  But after a while, all of a sudden, it helps you.  And you start.  You become more regular.  And it's just better for you.  I'm disgusted.  I know you are.  No, but it's better for your system.  It cleans out the system.  It cleans out the bad blood.  You need it over 10 years.  Let's say hi to Larry and Jolie.  Larry!  Larry!  Oh, yeah.  We're here.  Larry and your wife, girlfriend, Jolie?  No, I'm just a fellow truck driver. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, we've got two truck drivers from Canada on the line.  What's going on?  It's good, though.  Hey.  What's going on, eh?  We're just partying.  It's only 3 o'clock where we are.  So, it's not time for bed yet.  Oh, you're on the dark side of Canada.  Yeah, we're on the west coast.  Not that we're from here, but that's where we are.  I forget that Canada goes all the way across America.  Yeah, it does.  To me, Canada is like the area between Toronto and Montreal.  That's all I know. 
[00:21:30]  Really?  There's a whole big land out here that you don't even know about.  Out here.  Oh, my good God.  How do you guys get the XM?  It's illegal in Canada, no?  No, it's not.  Oh, no, no.  We've got a U.S. address.  It's not illegal up here.  I just tell them where I want to fucking put it, and that's it.  Really?  Hey, listen.  Yeah.  Yep.  We have them in our trucking camera, too.  Hey.  Trust me.  You guys are the greatest.  Yeah, you rock.  Hey, thank you, eh?  Oh, fuck me, anytime, eh? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's worth the extra $1.95 a month.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck at least.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I tell you, this girl who's with me, she's the best little bitch I've ever been with.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was going to tell you about the tongue vibrator.  Do you know about that?  Oh, no.  Why don't you tell us about it, eh?  Well, it's shaped like a bullet.  It's shaped like a bullet, is it?  And it's got little elastics that you put around your tongue.  Yeah.  And you turn it on, and it sounds like one fucking angry bee. 
[00:22:30]  Holy fuck, does it hurt?  It doesn't hurt.  It's pleasurable, but when you got it on your tongue, don't let your teeth flex it or your  eyes vibrate.  50 miles an hour?  Yeah.  That hurts.  It's a little redundant.  It's quite the toy.  Yeah, sounds like it.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We got them in Canada.  Do you have them in the States?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Are you sure?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, how come you never heard of it before then?  Well, I did hear of it.  Oh, you did? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, it's like an angry bee, eh?  It's an angry bee.  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like.  Yeah.  Like, you're not coming at me with that, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then once it starts happening, it's pretty good.  Yeah.  Actually very good.  Yeah.  Angry bee.  Yeah.  I don't think you guys have it.  Yeah, we got that.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, you got behind the times.  We got all kinds of dildos.  Oh, you got behind the times.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, it's Valentine's Day on Monday, eh?  Eh?  Yeah, what are you doing for Valentine's Day?  Yeah, I was in your truck, and I don't even know what they are yet. 
[00:23:30]  You got that up there, too, the Valentine's Day, eh?  I didn't think they celebrated that up there, eh?  I know you got Box Day.  No, he bought them today.  Yeah.  What?  I was there with a boyfriend.  That'd be my husband.  Hey, happy Valentine's Day to my moose.  He's a good friend of mine.  He goes, let's go do those little dicky things.  Little dicky things?  What are little dicky things?  Oh, trust me, you're going to find out.  Uh-huh.  There you go.  You got little dicky things down there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who the fuck are you? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we just wanted to call you and tell you how much we like your program.  Oh, you're the greatest guy.  We listen to you from Toronto to Vancouver every other day.  Yeah.  Every day.  Every day.  Yep.  Hey, do you guys bang or anything, or are you just friends?  Me and Larry?  Yeah.  We're just friends.  No.  We're the best friends.  All right.  We're good friends.  We don't bang.  All right.  I got a banger.  She's gorgeous, but she's a good friend.  I got my own banger.  I don't need Larry.  No.  All right.  Who's your husband?  Your husband, Rick?  And Larry's got his own banger. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, I got my gorgeous wife.  We just party together.  Yeah.  All right.  We can stay up the longest.  What's the drug of choice?  Today?  Yeah.  That'd be kokanee.  Do you know what kokanee is?  What's kokanee?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Trust me, I got it right.  It's that 5% beer.  It sucks.  No, it does not.  Oh, I believe it.  Our drug of choice tonight is beer.  Beer?  Beer.  Right on.  Yeah, when I lived in Buffalo, man, you guys got the best beer. 
[00:25:00]  Are you in Buffalo?  Yeah, there's a lot more alcohol in the Canadian beer, eh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not in Buffalo, though, are you?  Huh?  You're not in Buffalo, though.  No.  I was drinking Molson Ice.  Where the fuck are you?  I got hammered, eh?  No, I've been...  Oh, he's hammered.  I just scratched the border from Buffalo.  Oh, we're there now.  We broadcast from Buffalo.  Yeah, we're right at Niagara Falls.  Yeah.  We're looking for some of the bats.  I fell over the fucking falls one night. 
[00:25:30]  You fell over the falls one night?  I don't know about it.  I really did.  Huh?  He was drunk.  He forgot his barrel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It still had some beer in it, so he didn't want to get in.  I grew up doing that fucking shitty.  Wow, you guys are good enough to do a radio show, I think.  Hey, I haven't heard the trucker horn.  Oh, you want the trucker horn?  No.  But you usually don't let truckers talk that long.  Can you do me a favor?  Yes, truly.  Yeah, ask me to do what's in your pants. 
[00:26:00]  I'll play...  In your pants?  Play Guess What's in My Pants?  Yeah.  She wants to know what's in her pants.  I say a big hairy muskrat, eh?  What is it?  She hasn't got a fucking loop.  I know what's there.  Yeah, what's in your...  Do you really think so?  Yeah, I know what's there.  A Mountie.  Trust me, I don't think so.  What's in your pants?  What's in my pants?  Yeah.  Hallelujah.  Do you want to play?  One of my choices, a little Hitler?  Well, you want to actually play?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Is Larry allowed to watch?  I'm here, but I'll turn my back. 
[00:26:30]  All right, Larry, turn your back.  All right.  Be a nice gentleman for Jolie.  But we got one problem we got here.  What's that?  Yeah.  We got to dedicate this to Mark.  Yeah.  Who's Mark?  Mark, yeah.  Mark is the main man.  Oh, Mark is the one that she bangs?  Yeah.  Oh, Mark is her...  Yeah, it's the one I bang.  Yeah.  That's right.  She bangs him all the time.  Daily.  Inside, outside.  It's like some wacky Canadian morning show.  A corn burger? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  I think it's the only thing that I can have for free.  Yeah.  Everything else in life costs.  Yeah.  Bangin' doesn't cost.  Bangin'.  And I just took a drink.  Unless you're Jim Norton.  Straightened and just fucking trusting my tongue like you wouldn't believe.  All right.  Do we want to play what's in Jolie's Jolie?  I know what's in Jolie's pants.  I know what's in Jolie's pants.  No, you do not.  You want to play this, Ant?  The Canadian version?  Yeah, sure.  Why not, hey?  Okay.  What are my choices?  Well, we got to make it Canadian friendly, so let's think about this a little bit here. 
[00:27:30]  Any thoughts, guys?  What do we got to do with the Canadian accent?  I would say first is Big Beaver Pelt.  All right.  That's the first one, eh?  No, I don't got no Beaver Pelt.  Well, now you're giving us away the answer, eh?  No.  Yeah, eh?  You're, you're...  Okay, what's the next choice?  Jolie, do you know how the game's played?  No.  Yeah.  They're stupid in Canada.  You're not supposed to say what you...  Oh, sorry.  Okay, give me the choices.  The Beaver Pelt?  You blew it.  You blew it.  No, try again. 
[00:28:00]  Trust me.  I know how it's played, but we got to discuss it with her.  Oh, my God.  You drunken Canadians.  Should we go with this?  Drunken Canadians.  They're upsetting me with the...  It's cold up here.  She's ruining the game.  Okay, I fucked the game?  Okay, big, big, big Beaver Pelt.  The way you want, all right?  Barry's going to shut up and I'm going to listen.  All right, we're ready to go here.  Okay.  Listen to Anthony.  I don't have any more.  I'm hoping somebody else can help me with some Canadian stuff.  There's the Big Beaver Pelt. 
[00:28:30]  We're going to crank up the volume here.  And then what would be like good for a mohawk?  Eric's got something?  He's writing.  He's writing.  What, hawk?  It's like a mute.  Three feathers.  Yeah.  It's like a mute.  Hey, Bull Radley, what's your suggestion?  Backyard bacon for the...  Canadian bacon strip.  Canadian bacon strip.  Yeah.  That's not a bad idea.  That's good.  Canadian bacon?  Yeah, yeah.  I've been there for years.  That's like a...  No, the strip, though, not the round one.  Canadian bacon, what else? 
[00:29:00]  And then now we're looking for a Hitler mustache type thing.  Do you want the original fucking lay-me-down-its-fucking-air?  What could that be?  A Hitler mustache.  They're not talking to me anymore.  They haven't given me...  Oh, my God.  I want to nuke the whole nation.  You want to what?  I would love to send nuclear weapons up there just so you two shut up for a second.  What?  They're not bothering anyone.  Oh, yes, they are.  No one in Canada ever bothers anyone.  No nuke?  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  They're nuke?  They're funny people up there.  All right, why don't we...  They're no nuke, so they're nork.  Jolie.  They're like you and the nork.  Jolie.  Jolie.  What's the rest of my choices?  Well, we're going to just play the song and start the game.  Are you naked yet?  Yeah.  Oh, look.  She's been laying her naked for two hours, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And how hot is she?  What does she look like?  Blonde?  No, she's brunette.  Brunette?  She's gorgeous.  I would tell my wife about her, but I'm scared of what she'd do to me. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Oh, really?  You really like Jolie, right?  So, she's a pretty girl.  Very pretty girl.  And she's completely naked right now?  Yeah.  Yeah, she is.  All right, let's play the Canadian version.  Come on, let's play the game.  But she's willing to...  All right, we got the theme song ready to go.  It's the Canadian version of Guess What's in My Pants.  No, Dirk doesn't have it?  I got to tear my face, right?  It's time to play, eh?  Look the other way.  It's time to play, eh?  It's time to play, hey? 
[00:30:30]  Guess What's in My Pants, eh?  All right, Hitler Mustache.  Let's go to the other way.  Where's the song?  White folks from onanet.net have Hitler Mustache.  The sideways hockey puck.  Oh, very nice.  Kind of a sideways hockey puck.  All right.  Oh, my God.  They're battling, so let's play the theme song and play the Canadian version of Guess What's  in My Pants.  Shut up, eh?  Good talk over the hall, thanks for the way.  Well, what about...  Eh? 
[00:31:00]  Eh?  Oh, really?  It's time to play, hey?  Guess What's in My Pants.  Place the receiver.  Yeah.  Come on, you're beaver.  Yeah, yeah.  It's time to play, hey?  Guess What's in My Pants.  Canadian version, eh?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right, Jolie.  Jolie?  Hi, here.  All right, you're naked and ready to go?  Yep.  The last one would be the Zambonied.  Oh, very nice. 
[00:31:30]  Nice, completely.  Our listeners are awake.  We certainly aren't.  Hey, that was mine.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I occasionally think up a good one.  Okay.  Jolie.  Yeah?  Listen to Anthony now, okay?  Okay.  Okay, what we need you to do, Jolie, hey, is to take your phone and rub it up and down,  up and dune on your patch.  Okay.  All right?  Soaring down a sequoia?  What the hell was that? 
[00:32:00]  Speaker phone.  Speaker phone.  I took the whole phone and did it.  That ain't working.  You better fucking do it right.  That ain't working.  Look, Jolie.  Take...  You better fucking do something right.  Take the phone and rub it up and down on your area there.  Do you know what they're doing?  Do you know what they're doing? 
[00:32:30]  These tools.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Now rub it side to side.  All right.  Now rub it in a circular motion.  Did you hear that moose call?  Hey, Larry, what the hell's going on over there? 
[00:33:00]  What is she rubbing that phone on?  I'm a fucking helmet driver.  Trust me.  My face is going up.  No, no, no.  You wouldn't believe it.  How the fuck do you know my name?  That is the biggest waste of real estate.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, she's been doing everything you wanted.  Yeah.  She is not rubbing that phone on her area there.  Oh, you want to believe it?  It sounds like she's rubbing it on a totem pole. 
[00:33:30]  Wait, so what is she doing?  She's picking up the big phone and just rubbing the whole thing.  She put her pants down to her fucking ankles, and she just did exactly what she wanted.  All right.  Tell her to rub it again up and down.  But you know the worst of this?  This call?  She's going to get scared, because she's going to hit me if I don't fucking tell her exactly  what's going on.  Oh, my God.  Drunk.  She's gorgeous.  And now she's taking another phone call.  No, no.  Done.  All right.  She's got rosy red ruby lips. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  Larry, shut up.  Larry.  Larry, shut up a second.  Jolie.  Jolie, rub the phone up and down on your area.  On whose area?  Hers?  That is no way.  That sounds like sawing wood.  She's doing it.  I'm sitting here watching.  She's a good-looking girl.  And trust me, I'm telling you, she's fucking doing it.  Who wants to shoot Larry in the head with a high-powered rifle?  Who wants to shoot? 
[00:34:30]  The hands are flying up over here.  I want to kill Larry.  I like Larry.  I kind of like Larry.  Larry's a cool dude.  He's like a Canadian Tommy Chong.  Hey.  Hey, where's the weed, eh?  Where's the weed?  We don't have any.  We don't have any.  All right, are we going to try to finish this game or what?  Yeah, come on.  How about we do the circular motion?  Circular motion.  Rub it in circles on your... 
[00:35:00]  Oh, don't you do that to me.  Sorry.  No.  No nipples.  That is not...  Wait, what...  Larry, what is she doing to you?  Well, she's playing games, eh?  In what way?  Well, she was taking a phone and all of a sudden you stuck her nipple against my shoulder.  Oh, she rubbed her nipple up against your shoulder?  Yeah.  I think you guys are going to have sex later today, huh?  No, we're not.  No, we're not.  Your husband is coming here.  Oh, Parker, Harvey.  Oh, Parker.  There's Mark.  I'm in trouble. 
[00:35:30]  Larry, how are you?  Oh, shit.  I'm in trouble.  We just got busted.  Can you protect me?  Is that me?  Hey, Anthony, can you protect Larry?  Oh, shit.  This one guy's big.  He's a fucking big monster.  I hope he kills you, Larry.  Oh, he's going to be laughing.  God damn.  Why are you lucky?  Shit.  Why didn't you fucking tell me how big he was?  What the fuck? 
[00:36:00]  Holy fuck.  What, is Joey naked?  No.  It's not that this guy's going to fucking kill me.  Oh, yeah, I'm naked.  And my husband, you know, they don't need to be laughing.  He's like an SNL kid.  I know.  That's okay.  He just went outside to listen on the XM.  He did.  This guy's good.  He doesn't mind that I'm laying here naked on the desk.  Yeah, but that's not the problem.  The problem is, he's going to be there. 
[00:36:30]  He's going to fucking beat the shit out of me.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Sorry for your luck.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking right.  Kick my ass right out the fucking door, right?  Are they doing shtick?  Oh, man.  It's just awful.  It's an awful shtick now it's turned into?  They're not doing shtick.  Trust me.  I like you guys.  I listen to you all the time.  They're not doing shtick.  I know what happened here.  Jolie's husband was listening in the truck and decided he has to come in and see what the  hell's going on.  All right.  Are we done with these two?  Of course we are.  I know what you've got down there. 
[00:37:00]  A big hockey mullet.  All right.  I'm going to finish playing the game.  All right.  One more rub.  Oh, ladies.  Side to side.  Side to side.  Side to side?  Yeah.  Knock it off.  You're wrecking the game forever.  Goddamn Canadians.  I hate Canada.  I hate you.  Oh, you can't.  No, you should come up and party with us.  Oh, my God.  The best party you've ever had.  Why don't we sooner go to North Korea? 
[00:37:30]  North Korea.  And get your ass shot off.  All right.  Why don't we all guess here?  Anthony, to you.  I will say the Canadian bacon strip.  Jimmy?  I'm going to guess.  It's been zambonied.  Zambonied?  A lot?  I'll do sideways.  I never heard that one.  I'll do sideways hockey puck.  All right.  Jolie, what do you have in your pants? 
[00:38:00]  What do I have in my pants?  Yeah.  Baby clean.  Ah, the zambonied.  Yeah.  Very good.  Jimmy wins.  But really, there are no winners here after this phone call.  Are there?  Is there one of you guys winning or what?  Shut up, Larry.  Larry, you guys call back.  You guys call back.  Can you get a horn dog one?  You guys call back in a little bit, then give us an update on your drunkenness, okay?  Our neighbors to the north.  We've been drunk for all fucking night.  That's all.  Wow, really?  Greetings from Canada. 
[00:38:30]  And thanks for playing Guess What's in My Pants.  We'll show you how.  Freedom.  Times have changed.  Our kids are getting worse.  They won't obey their parents.  They just want to fart and curse.  Should we blame the government?  Or blame society?  Or should we blame the images on TV?  No!  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  We've all their beady little eyes.  The clapping heads are full of lies.  Blame Canada! 
[00:39:00]  Blame Canada!  We need to form a full assault.  You can't be a fool.  Don't blame me for my son Stan.  He saw the darn cartoon and now he's off to join the clan.  And my boy Eric once had my picture on his shelf.  But now when I see him it tells me to fuck myself.  Well, blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  It seems that everything's gone wrong since Canada came along.  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  They're not even a real country anyway. 
[00:39:30]  My son could have been a doctor or a lawyer, Richard Drew.  He said he burned him like a piggy on a barbecue.  Should we blame the matches?  Should we blame the fire?  Or the doctors who were allowed to expire?  Heck no!  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  With all the hockey hummer balloon.  And that bitch at Murray too.  Blame Canada!  Shame on Canada!  Oh, this is a moment when I got the trash.  We're trash, the laughter and buttons.  We're so happy and duds.  We must win and we're hard to fight.  We both, the body thinks the plane is done.  No! 
[00:40:00]  I just love a drive in the country.  Laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low.  Don't you think, Ramone?  Ramone!  Ramone, call 9-1-1. 
[00:40:30]  M-2-0-2.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:41:00]  We're doing something a little different today in studio.  We have our buddy, our pal, Drew Boogie that does all the Opie and Anthony remixes.  Actually scratching live.  He's right next to Anthony.  He's right next to Anthony.  He's right next to Anthony.  He's right next to Anthony.  He's right next to Anthony.  He's right next to Anthony.  He's right next to Anthony.  Not too shabby.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  He's right next to Anthony. 
[00:41:30]  Very good.  Thank you, Drew Boogie.  We'll hear more from him.  He's going to work in some of the O&A material as well as he's scratching here and there.  Very cool.  In and out of breaks.  We're watching TV here because the gates are going up in Central Park, Anthony.  The gates are going up.  Very important stuff.  The gates.  Christo, the artist.  Christo.  He's just one name, huh?  Yeah.  Christo and his wife.  Crisco.  Crisco.  What?  It's not Crisco? 
[00:42:00]  I think it's Crisco.  I thought it was like the oil.  Crisco.  They once wrapped a building in Germany.  A bridge.  And then they, I don't know, then they did something, I think, in San Francisco where  someone died because an umbrella fell over and killed somebody.  Yeah.  They did a bunch of umbrellas or something.  Yeah, I don't know, but the gates are going up in Central Park.  Him and his wife, this freak of a woman with really bright red hair, even though she's  like 80 years old.  Yeah, it's orange.  Like Ronald McDonald color.  Exactly.  That's exactly what it is.  So it's Christo and his wife. 
[00:42:30]  They're taking over Central Park for the next week or so, and it's the gates.  I don't understand.  You know what?  Everyone's interpretation of art is different, obviously, but I don't get why this is art.  It looks like something, if it's something that Anthony and I could have done, I don't  think it's art.  Anything.  That's my definition.  If I could do it or Anthony could do it, it's not art.  You want to explain this?  It's like orange gates.  It's a bunch of orange gates.  What they are is, it's not even a gate, it's a structure.  It's like a doorway. 
[00:43:00]  It's like a large doorway.  And they're straddling the paths through Central Park for how many miles?  Twenty-three miles.  Twenty-three miles of this.  And then what they're doing is draping some kind of gold rag over these things.  So you'll walk through this flowing gold material that's going to be on these metal doorways  or something that are being put up all through the park.  And they're putting them up. 
[00:43:30]  He's an artist.  This is like an art thing.  But like you said, anyone with enough money to buy the materials can do this.  It's not one of those things like, you know, get a canvas and paint the Mona Lisa.  Not anyone can do this.  Oh, no?  How do you go to New York City, like the mayor's office, and say, hey, I got an idea.  I'm going to take over Central Park.  That's his talent.  Huh?  That's his talent, being able to talk people into doing these things.  I guess they're expecting like 90,000 visitors to Central Park that would normally not go there 
[00:44:00]  to check this out.  And there's going to be little stands where you can buy T-shirts and stuff.  If they really want to put a gate up, they should put it at the northern end of the park  so no one above 110th Street can come in and attack joggers.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Bravo.  Well, our own Big Kev is part of the project, Anthony, because they need all these helpers.  I hear they need like 1,000 or 2,000 helpers to get these stupid doorways up and to drop  the drapes down when they're ready, I guess, which will be later today or tomorrow, right? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  So our own Big Kev, who hangs out here from time to time, you've seen him at a bunch of  our events.  Sorry, I was just picturing Jimmy's Gate and some Hollywood guy right in front of it going,  get a picture of him with a girl.  So Big Kev was on the news yesterday.  Stop, you're scaring him.  Old Charles Grodin with a big foot in his face. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, Beretta.  So Big Kev was on the news yesterday.  Yes, Big Kev apparently part of this whole thing.  Let's hear what Big Kev had to say last night.  The installation began in spring-like weather earlier this week, and we found among the workers  morale was high.  I'm honored and thrilled to be able to work on one of his pieces that's so close to my  home, and I'm excited.  I'm just, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.  Fag! 
[00:45:30]  What a cliche-slinging ass Kev is.  I'm thrilled, I'm excited, I'm ecstatic.  So close to home.  You know what the best part of that call is, or the best part of the sound clip is, is the  fact that he's like, I'm so excited about this.  Like, play it.  Listen to his voice.  He doesn't sound, maybe he's tired from helping out, you know, maybe from moving these things  around.  Yeah, because all the helpers have to do the heavy lifting, as Christo and his wife just 
[00:46:00]  walk around and admire it.  Look through the gates as they go up, and other people are actually doing the hard work.  Christo, you want to help us with this?  Yeah, Christo, grab my wrench.  Please.  And Kev doesn't sound as excited as he should be sounding.  Shouldn't the artist have to do the actual artwork?  Yeah.  It's like, alright, take that paintbrush, now make a face.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to get an artist, and I'm just going to say,  alright, paint a face there, put some hair there, a body there, and then I'll go, look, 
[00:46:30]  look what I did.  Big Kev has more to do with this art project than Christo.  Yeah.  That awful wife, how do you look, she looks like a John Wayne Gacy painting, why is she  involved in anything?  Alright, let's listen to Kev again.  The installation began in spring-like weather earlier this week, and we found among the workers,  morale was high.  I'm honored and thrilled to be able to work on one of his pieces that's so close to my  home, and I'm excited. 
[00:47:00]  I'm just, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.  And I'm excited, I'm always thrilled, thrilled here to us.  Big Kev is on the phone here.  Big Kev.  Kev.  Good morning.  What is wrong with you?  Well, you sound excited again.  Are you thrilled and excited to be on the show?  I'm excited to be on the show this morning.  Dude, you're not that excited, are you?  To be on the show?  No, I mean to be part of the art project. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I am, actually.  This is what Kev does, of course he's excited.  Why are you excited?  It looks stupid.  Well, it's not done yet, number one.  You know, it hasn't been unfurled yet.  That's going to happen on Saturday morning.  Saturday morning.  Yeah.  Are they going to all happen at once?  No, it's actually going to start at about 8, and by 11 o'clock they'll all be open.  Mm-hmm.  So are these things actually going to be completely covered?  Like, will you get wet if it rains, or no? 
[00:48:00]  No, they're just like little stupid, I don't know, orange flags that drape down.  It's actually a curtain.  It's the width.  A curtain.  Yeah, it's like a curtain.  It's the width of the gate, and it falls, and it hangs down.  I can reach it if I reach up high.  It's actually going to be very high over your head.  It doesn't go all the way to the ground.  All right, listen, listen.  Oh, oh.  Listen, listen, listen, listen.  We have to fix the phones.  It's been happening for two or three days that...  Go ahead, Kevin. 
[00:48:30]  Sorry.  No, you had nothing to do with it.  Oh.  We want everyone to hear you perfectly, but the phones are a little weird.  It's like we're deep-sea diving or something.  Sounds like when R2-D2 gets hit and falls down.  Yeah.  It makes that sound.  But why, I mean...  There are 7,500 of them.  Mm-hmm.  I was on a crew of nine, and we put up 110 in three days.  Ooh. 
[00:49:00]  And what did that entail, putting them up?  The bases are about 300 pounds apiece on each side.  They were already laid out.  And my crew came in and put on a leveling plate onto the base, attached that,  and then we assembled the gate, and then lifted the gate into place and secured it.  What is the gate made out of?  Wood.  It's made out of, like, a vinyl material. 
[00:49:30]  A space-age polymer.  Yes.  Really?  It's plastic?  With aluminum jointing at the top and at the base.  Extrusions.  That's what it's made out of.  Wonderful.  Yeah, very exciting.  Very exciting.  It's 23 miles long, right?  It's 23 miles, yeah.  It's throughout the entire park.  And how much did this project cost?  23 million dollars. 
[00:50:00]  23 million dollars.  And who footed that bill?  The artist.  Christo.  Christo.  Christo actually did that?  He paid for that himself?  Not only did he pay the entire bill, he's cutting a check to the park for 3 million dollars  for the use of the space.  What?  And all the proceeds from all the merchandising goes to two different charities.  How does Christo have so much money?  Because he's a world-famous artist.  Yeah, but if his art costs him so much money, how does he make money? 
[00:50:30]  Because there are collectors throughout the world who pay top dollar for his sketch work  leading up to a project like this.  All right, now I got a question.  Okay.  What now happens to, how many gates are there?  7,500.  7,500 gates.  What happens to these gates at the end of this thing?  Every bit of it gets recycled.  What do you mean?  Recycled. 
[00:51:00]  He won't sell them?  No.  I can picture one gate at a time being sold to go somewhere.  Nope.  Make a little money back now, huh?  Nope.  Every bit of it gets recycled.  Just ground up?  Yeah.  Into plastic and turned into something else?  And Kevin, why do you think this is art?  Why do I think it's art?  Yeah.  Because it's someone's expression.  What is he trying to express?  So if I stand in front of it and look at it and just throw up, is that also art? 
[00:51:30]  I mean, if that's your response to it, Jimmy, you have at least an emotional response to it.  You have an emotional response to it.  I know what you're saying, but what is he trying to express, though?  Yeah.  He's not trying to express anything.  You know, it's something that you have to actually see it as a whole thing.  So, in other words, if you were to see it, if you were to pass through it, if you, you know, after Saturday, if you happen to be near the park, take a walk through it.  You know, it's a gray, dismal February in New York. 
[00:52:00]  And here's this bright thing that's going to blow in the wind, and it's going to pick up the sunlight.  It's a very nice aesthetic.  He's selling it.  All right.  Well, he's doing a good job selling it.  I live close to the park, so I'll check it out, and I'll have a review on Monday.  I'll go, I'll go, too.  All right.  Just uncultured asses.  Yeah, but there's also a certain thing you have to question sometimes.  Some things are passed over as art that aren't, but I can kind of see Kev's point. 
[00:52:30]  All right, Kev.  I'm honored and thrilled and excited that you called.  A Picasso living in our lifetime.  A Picasso stinks.  Yeah, slow down.  Yeah, slow down.  I understood Picasso.  I didn't.  He was awful.  No, he wasn't.  I liked his blue period myself.  I didn't.  Norman Rockwell, that's an artist.  You look at it and go, there's an older gentleman, and there's a little runaway.  That's art.  And they're having a soda pop.  They're having a soda.  Exactly.  A little tussleable kid coming in for a soda.  There's the older gentleman promising a little red fire engine. 
[00:53:00]  To the youngster.  You know that doctor's going to hit him with a cold stethoscope, and he's going to go,  ooh.  Yeah.  All right.  The doctor has a long neck, but.  Hey, Big Kev.  Yeah.  Didn't one of his art projects cause someone to die?  The umbrellas in California.  Somebody climbed up on one.  Or it might have been Japan.  Japan.  Somebody climbed on one, and it unbalanced it.  It blew over, and there were some injuries involved.  Yes.  But someone died?  Yeah, I believe so. 
[00:53:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  There was some injuries involved, but those beaches will stay open.  I don't want to open that shark and have that Crisco fag fall out all over the desk.  Crisco, whatever his name is.  Crisco.  Who cares?  Instant feedback's coming in.  Yeah.  How many are calling Big Kev a fag?  That's all I need to know.  A couple of them.  That's okay.  Sex Hoagie, of course, from Whack Bag is saying, congrats, Big Kev. 
[00:54:00]  He worked his ass off putting up decorative cloth that will become a homeless man's blanket  in a matter of hours.  It can't.  It can't be detached from the gate, number one.  It can't?  It couldn't reach it.  Really?  They had, when they were testing the gates out before they installed them, they had mountain  climbers climbing up on the gates to test their sturdiness and the cloth's sturdiness.  Really?  This is, it's not like a piece of cotton hanging down. 
[00:54:30]  It's like a reinforced nylon curtain, a lot like climbing rope, like mountain climbing  rope in like a curtain form.  There's no way.  So we can't start the domino effect, we can't knock down one gate and hope for the best?  Nope.  Now that would be art.  That would certainly be art.  Just tip it over.  All right.  Go ahead and try.  Hey.  Ooh, the challenge has been put in.  All right.  Kev almost said, I dare you.  Yeah, thank you, Big Kev.  Kev, thank you.  It's not possible. 
[00:55:00]  I'm thrilled, ecstatic, and excited that you have called in.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you, Kev.  All right.  Bye, Kev.  Bye.  There he goes, our resident nerd, Big Kev.  It's true.

[00:57:00]  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  Cancel all appointments.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath. 
[00:57:30]  And begin.  Fix it, fix it.  Guess who's back?  I'm over here now.  Back again.  Nice head, dick.  Back.  Bag it.  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  Back again.  I don't believe it.  Don't mind.  You're so stupid.  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Back again.  Guess who's back? 
[00:58:00]  Tell my friend.  Guess who's back?  Hey.  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Turn it off?  Guess who's back?  Guess who's back?  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What?  What's all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little way.  Because it feels so comfy without me.  I'm saying this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little way. 
[00:58:30]  Because it feels so empty without me.  Okay, caught.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  4XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:59:00]  Pretty cool to check out, huh?  We got Drew Boogie live in the studio today, mixing and spinning and scratching, itching,  I don't know, whatever the hell he does, but he's cool as hell. 
[00:59:30]  I love the sound.  It's pretty cool.  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Also want to say hi to Keith the cop.  Keith.  Keith's in studio today.  Good morning, gentlemen.  And he had something unusual happen to him on the way to work today or on the way to the  show today.  Good morning.  Well, I figured since I was coming in and I haven't been in a while, I would pass downtown  and look for our pal Tippi Tom.  Now imagine that.  We might have had Tippi Tom on the show today, but since he's a true homeless guy, he's kind 
[01:00:00]  of hard to find because he doesn't have a home.  You can't just pull up and bring him in.  But, boy, that would have been fun today, huh?  Friday with old golden buns here in the studio.  But you kind of know some of the areas.  Who's he hangs out in, right?  He's a territorial sort of guy.  He hangs out down in the meat market sort of area.  I hang out in the meat market. 
[01:00:30]  We've got to get him back on.  Golden buns.  Golden buns.  Ugh.  So, actually, Ben did see him up in Penn Station not too long ago.  So, I guess he migrates north for the cold weather to hang out in Penn Station.  Brilliant.  How come he doesn't go down, like, underground where all those mole people go?  I don't think the homeless are really into the mole people.  That's actually like a whole separate society.  Oh, okay.  That's the same thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Homeless or just homeless, walking around the streets.  How do you become a mole person?  Someone says, come on down, check it out.  Fall in a manhole. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  So, you were looking for Tibby Tom this morning.  Yeah.  So, I was driving up and down the meat market.  And, well, I guess I kind of forgot that when you're driving up and down the meat market  eight to ten times back and forth, that you bring some attention to yourself.  Now, you should know this more than anybody.  I should know this.  And, you know, but I'm on a mission.  I'm looking for Tibby Tom.  And I wasn't thinking much. 
[01:01:30]  And I have to commend my fellow brothers in blue who this morning were driving around in  an unmarked vehicle.  And I figured they were, I'm driving and all of a sudden I hear a little whoop, whoop.  And I see the little teardrop in the dashboard of the car.  And I figure, oh, they're going to a call.  Let me pull over to the side and let them go by.  And, well, I was the call this morning.  They weren't trying to get around you. 
[01:02:00]  They're pulling you over.  So, cops pulling over a cop.  And, basically, I pulled over and they pulled over.  I mean, I go, what the hell?  And I go, oh.  They think you're picking up a tranny.  Because, you know, when you are driving around down there and you're driving kind of slow  and I'm looking along the building line, you know, there are these trannies and they see you.  And they wave and stuff, you know, like they think you're cruising.  Right.  And, obviously, so did the NYPD.  You were driving slow, kind of looking out your window, looking for Tibby Tom. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  And, so I pulled over and they got out of the car and come up to the window.  And, of course, they have the same smart-ass sort of comment like I would have.  And they go, looking for a date?  And I'm like, you offering handsome?  You know, and it was slightly embarrassing at that point just, you know, because they think I'm looking for a date.  Yeah, for that split second. 
[01:03:00]  And even, you know, I pulled my ID out and I said, no, I'm not looking for a date.  And, you know, they go, oh.  And, you know, I don't think they believed me right away until I did mention my.  Oh, now we got a brother here who's looking for a tranny.  They're like, oh, look at this cock-sucking face.  So, it turned out, you know, I mentioned my affiliation with the show.  I said, you know, I happen to work with the opening of this show and I'm looking for it.  And they did know the show.  And, oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  And they said, you know, I really didn't fit the description.  They said most of the time around that time they get meaty-titted white guys driving a Saturn with jersey plates.  That's usually the type of people that are stopping at that point in time in the morning.  I don't have jersey plates.  But Tippy Tom, that's a good one.  I have to remember that.  I thought this was Tippy Tom.  You think they were buying it?  Yeah, I think when I met.  They weren't buying it until I did mention. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  And they knew Tippy Tom from the old days.  But there was nothing they could do to you, right?  No, no.  Just harass you a little bit?  That's pretty much what they were.  You know, you can get guys for cruising, but you'd have to.  I love when the cops know the show, man.  That is the best.  I got pulled over once going down the Bell Parkway.  I was flying.  And the cops call that area the killing fields.  You know, you see people pulled over there all the time.  And they got pulled over.  And it was highway patrol, you know.  So he's got his glasses and his leathers on and everything like that. 
[01:04:30]  And he comes over.  Just badass.  You know, license, registration, insurance.  Just right by the book and everything.  Goes back to the car.  I didn't tell him anything.  You know, I wasn't even going to try to get out of it.  But apparently when he called my name over, somebody had told him, oh, that's Anthony from  the Opie and Anthony show.  So I see him get out of the car.  I look in my rearview mirror.  And he's got this big smile on his face as he's walking over.  His attitude, he might as well have been a different person. 
[01:05:00]  You know, when they come up to the window and they're all badass and stuff, you're like  intimidated, kind of, you know, I'll be polite, nice, try to get out of this unscathed.  And then he comes up just like, hey, dude, what's up?  Love the show.  Skated another one.  That's awesome.  Love when they like the show.  Hate when it's somebody that you know is out of the demo.  You know, when I get pulled over and I see a black woman walk up to the door, I don't  even mention it.  Have you ever heard of Opie and... 
[01:05:30]  No, just give me the ticket, please.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go back to the phone and say hi to David in Dallas.  David, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Morning.  Morning.  Reading the paper yesterday, and our friends at Panzerfaust Records have a little problem.  Evidently, one of the co-founders of that organization may be partly of Hispanic descent, and it's  created so much controversy with the outfit, I think they've ceased operations, I just thought 
[01:06:00]  you guys might want to know.  So, also, as to your little GI problem, don't worry.  I think some of that comes with age.  You might want to get a gastro doctor to take a little look, but you're going to be fine.  It's one of those things that...  All right, David.  Thank you.  Jesus.  I love it. 
[01:06:30]  News on white supremacists and a little medical advice.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, that's the show.  My trucker told me that if you start worrying about it, it actually makes it worse.  So, I just thought I would pass that along for a further discussion.  David, what are you hauling today?  I have a load of limestone dust.  Limestone?  What?  Yes.  Lime or lamb?  Lime.  Limestone.  Lamb?  Limestone.  Oh, limestone. 
[01:07:00]  Like you put in the Corona lamb.  Oh, lime.  Limestone.  Limestone, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, David.  Thank you.  All right.  Watch it out.  Where's Martini Steve?  He knows the details of this story.  We might have to play the Hulk music because we had these guys who were the owner of the  company on the show.  Panzerfaust.  And it turns out one of the founders of the record label is a Mexican.  This might not be pure.  Might not be of pure Aryan blood.  He's got a little Mexican in him, I think. 
[01:07:30]  Somebody's, was it mother or grandmother?  Yeah, Steve knows the...  Steve's coming in with the details.  As he walks into the...  Oh, here he is right now.  Martini Steve, everyone.  It's Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, man.  So, what's the deal with this thing?  Panzerfaust.  I guess Byron, the guy that we talked to, he found out that his partner's mother was  Mexican.  How dare he?  Yeah, exactly.  How dare he?  And considering that the label is completely Aryan in nature, he doesn't want anything to 
[01:08:00]  do with the guy.  So, he called it quits, got out of the label, and now I guess he's suing for...  How do you say suing?  I don't...  That's the part I don't get.  I don't understand what he's suing for.  Suing because he had the wrong blood.  Maybe he's suing for...  Poor guy had to grow up with that humiliation.  Now you're going to rub it in in court?  I guess he's...  You know, I guess they formed a partnership based on the fact that they were both...  No, I was just kidding.  Of pure blood.  I know.  I know.  I'm just...  Exactly.  So hard to be an Aryan white supremacist racist these days. 
[01:08:30]  It really is.  It's really hard because you just don't know if you're a pure blood anymore.  You know how he found out?  I did hear this.  It was that Dennis Hopper told him in a trailer while he was trying to get information.  So he found out who his great-great-great-grandmother fucked.  And they were Mexicans.  That's...  You're a great-great-great...  Fuck the Mexican.  Yeah.  Had a Mexican kid. 
[01:09:00]  Oh!  Oh!  I love this guy.  You're an enchilada.  Oh!  So they're out of business.  They're out of business.  At least for now.  I mean, Byron, I...  Just after speaking with Byron, I can't imagine he'd be out of it for too long.  He just speaks with such fervor and passion about what he does.  I can't imagine.  Yeah.  He loves being a white supremacist.  He loves the whole thing.  So I can't imagine him being out of the game.  I just think that label in that incarnation is...  Do you know how long they had been working together? 
[01:09:30]  No.  No.  I don't think it was...  I think it was a couple years, but I don't...  How long could you keep that from your business part?  I don't know.  Just look at his face.  It was round.  A round face gives away if you're Mexican?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  How did he find out about the other guy's mother?  Did he, like, open a hotel door when someone was knocking and go,  Oh, you.  No.  Eskeeping.  Well, I got a little taste of Penzer Faust's music. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, which...  Oh, yeah.  Which lovely...  We haven't played this one in a while.  ...happy, loving song are we playing today?  Just a little taste of what they put out to the masses.  We hit the song?  Oh.  Oh.  Freddy was a boy made a big noise rollin' in the sheets  Sodomizing some guy one day got cover on his face  Big disgrace  Shakin' his ass all over the place 
[01:10:30]  Aids will, Aids will kill you  Sing  Aids will, Aids will kill you  Aids will, Aids will kill you  Aids will, Aids will kill you  Aids will, Aids will kill you 
[01:11:00]  Aids will, Aids will kill you  Aids will, Aids will kill you  That cute diddy  Right there  That's nice  One of the many songs they had out there  What about Shit Dick?  Well, I was gonna...  I'm leading up to that, Jimmy  Oh, okay  I'm leading up to that  This situation is like that  Remember the episode of Oz  When the white supremacist, one of them, needed a gum transplant  And the dentist in the prison thought it would be funny to use a black guy as a donor, as a gum donor 
[01:11:30]  For this white supremacist, and gave him black guy's gums, and then let the word out that that's what happened  And the white supremacist just, like, beat him up  And then, of course, it's Oz, so they had to, you know, rail him in the ass in some back room somewhere  But it's kind of like that, you know  They're all buddy-buddy, and then they find out they got some impurities, and, oh, it's all over  All right, here's another ditty that these guys had out there 
[01:12:00]  A towel is not a hat  Oh, I remember this one  Remember this one?  I'm talking about a hat  Go to the store 
[01:12:30]  Disapprove  Another sticky age rep  Worse than a Jew  Ever heard of a stult  You smell like fuckin' shit  With that towel on your head  You make me fuckin' sick  Go to the hot  Go to the hot  Go to the hot  Go to the hot 
[01:13:00]  Go to the hot  Go to the hot  Go to the hot  Just a towel head  Let him opportunity  Get the work, keep some  Brings his old family  Gonna rip you off  Better kill your chain  Drag on your head  Drop the greasy maze  Go to the hot  I love that part of the song right there 
[01:13:30]  Great  There you go, a towel's not a hat  Incidentally, I think that as white supremacists go, I don't know if they really think that Arabs are worse than Jews. I think they're on the sides of the Arabs because they hate Jews so much.  Huh. I don't know. They sound pretty hateful. They sound pretty hateful for everybody though.  But because the Arabs oppose Jews and attack Jews, I think Jews are number one on their hate list.  Yeah.  So they're on the side of like the Palestinians and, you know. 
[01:14:00]  I think Jews are the worst.  Or homosexuals.  And then homosexuals.  Oh, I see that. Okay.  And then blacks.  And then Mexicans.  And then, you know, I guess Asians.  Well, we're trying to get Byron on the phone.  He'll give us the...  The top ten he hates.  Yeah.  They're not very...  They're not very...  Inclusive.  This is like when the Beatles broke up, you know.  You're hearing the music and knowing that, you know...  They're no longer.  Yeah.  And then we got this email that ties into the last song that we've been playing on our program. 
[01:14:30]  I guess this guy wrote you, Jimmy.  I wrote Jimmy.  Oh.  About the Pats rolling rally yesterday.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I guess after the Super Bowl, they do their parade, obviously.  And there was a lot of TV cameras and stuff up there in Boston.  And at the Pats rolling rally yesterday, some girl flashed her boobs live on TV.  And then I saw a sign that said, O&A Shit Dick.  Really?  Yeah, we got a lot of these emails that came in.  So I guess someone got a shit dick sign on Boston TV during their Super Bowl celebration, Anthony. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  During the parade.  It was live on about four stations here in Boston.  Wow.  Absolutely hysterical.  You can ask Jimmy.  I left him a message on his cell.  I'm Joe from Boston.  So, yeah, that really did happen.  And that brings us to the final song that we were playing from these guys, Anthony.  Yes.  We hate all shit dick. 
[01:15:30]  Andy Warhol.  Shit dick.  Mick Jagger.  Shit dick.  Michael Jackson.  Shit dick.  Jeffrey Dahmer.  Cannibal.  Shit dick.  We ain't shit dick. 
[01:16:00]  But slamming shit dick.  Boy George.  Shit dick.  Freddie Mercury.  Shit dick.  David Bowie.  Shit dick.  Rob.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  DUNIS.  PREE.  CHICK DAAAAAAY. 
[01:16:30]  Shit dick.  Rock Hudson.  Shit dick.  Nibirachi.  Shit dick.  Jim neighbor.  Shit dick.  ALFORD.  ENGLAND.  FREDDIE KROEGAR.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  HALFORD.  Oh, my God.  Truman Capote, shit dick.  Richard Simmons, shit dick. 
[01:17:00]  Jimmy Norton, shit dick.  No.  Richard Gere, fuck, turbulent shit dick.  We ain't the funky shit dick.  The funky shit dick.  You're sick, sick, sick.  There you have it, Anthony.  There you have it.  So Panzerfaust is no longer in business.  No.  I'm sure we'll get Byron on the phone to tell us exactly what happened, 
[01:17:30]  give us some more details about the breakup with his Mexican partner.  Oh, that must have just enraged him.  Because he had a good thing going.  You know, he was on CNN.  I mean, he was getting a lot of media coverage,  and then it comes out that his partner is Mexican.  I wonder what tipped him off,  the fact that he'd only buttoned the top button of his shirts.  Hey, Holmes.  I know, Byron, the blacks are moving in.  Too on, too on.  Let's say hi to Lady Di. 
[01:18:00]  Lady Di, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  How you doing, shit dick?  What's up, Lady Di?  No, no, no.  There's no shit dick over here.  Oh, shut up.  Listen, I called to tell you that today's married birthday.  Hey, how's the job going?  Well, the jobs, they're just still going on.  Oh, yeah?  It's still going on.  You went to school to learn how to get a job?  Well, actually, what they do is they tell you where to go to get a job.  Right, right.  And you went to this place?  Well, the position was filled already. 
[01:18:30]  What position was it?  I don't know, something with a warehouse.  Warehouse work.  Really?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You went to this place?  No, I called them up, and they told me the position has been filled, because I just wanted  to get directions on how to get there.  You're doing a great job finding a job.  Well, you are such a liar.  I want to get this straightened out, because you're lying again.  No, I'm not.  There is this school.  You said you were going to school to find out how to get a job.  No, right. 
[01:19:00]  You go to school to get a job.  And did you go to the school?  They make you do a resume.  Did you go to the school?  That is a school.  Did you go to it?  Yes.  And what happened?  And they told me where to go.  You know, there was an opening in Springfield, New Jersey.  There was an opening over there.  And before I even went, I called them up, and they said, the position has been filled.  Yeah.  So you went to school to make one phone call?  I said I had to go over there.  Yeah.  To make one phone call, she went to school.  Well, no, that was the only place that they had so far. 
[01:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  Except for places where, you know, you have to be a driver, you need a CDO.  No, it's great.  The phones have been, I'm not going to lie to you, a little light.  Yeah.  A little light.  Lady Di comes on, and look at the phones.  They just exploded.  Oh, what happened now?  I can't stand her.  Lady Di, what do you know about Panzerfaust?  Excuse me?  What do you know about Panzerfaust?  What's that?  You were on hold during the whole break.  Don't you even listen?  Yeah, well, I heard the whole show.  All right.  We were just talking about Panzerfaust.  What are they? 
[01:20:00]  Panzerfaust?  I was only on hold from 6.30 on.  We just talked about it 10 minutes ago.  We just talked about it before we took your phone call.  What is Panzerfaust about?  Panzerfaust?  I don't know.  You know you're an unemployed lump.  This is why she doesn't have a job.  She's unemployable.  And you don't know how to listen.  I'm not working right now.  She's an unfit mother.  All right.  You've been listening since 6.30.  What about the great Christo?  Who is the great Christo?  Yeah, I heard about that.  I heard about that.  Central Park, you know, they put up all the decorations. 
[01:20:30]  Then Big Kev was on the phone.  I heard about that.  What are the decorations about?  Ah, I really think we need to start.  I really think we have to dumb down this show because we try really hard.  And then we could give, you know, we give a little pop quiz to someone like that.  Don't use her as a litmus test.  And I realize that there's a lot of dummies out there.  We don't need to try as hard on this program.  So what is the art project in Central Park?  Ah, by Christo.  Explain it. 
[01:21:00]  Well, something to do with lights and everything like that.  You know, when you walk through it.  There is a light involved in the whole project.  Ladies and gentlemen, she's been listening to the entire program.  And this is what she's got.  You are a blithering idiot.  But I'm doing other things as well.  You know, around the house and everything.  And I'm listening to it.  All right.  So it's lights and what else?  Lights and decorations.  And Big Kev called up and he said something about it.  He put up a few things over there.  What did he put up?  So I might even go over there and visit one day, you know, before it goes down. 
[01:21:30]  I don't know if it's going to go down.  But, you know, when?  Because you've got plenty of free time instead of going looking for a job.  You're going to look at non-existent lights in Central Park.  No, no, no.  I've been looking for a job.  I've been looking in the paper and I have been looking.  By the way.  There's no doubt about that.  By the way, we have Julie back on the line.  She offered you a job, but you never called her.  Oh, boy.  Hey, there you go.  Offered a job, never called.  Well.  Hold on, stupid.  It depends on where the job is.  You didn't even call her to find out where the job is, you twat. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Well, look.  I've got to get her phone number again.  Julie.  Yeah.  Hi, Julie.  I remember you.  You called up.  You were...  See, this is why...  Because I get a lot of hate email because I go after Lady Di.  She's a waste of space.  No, I'm not.  Good people are dying every day and this fat slob of nothing continues to live.  Be nice.  Diane, you're never going to get a job.  Why?  You know why?  Because you're sitting at home.  You're not sending out your resume.  Jobs are being filled all day long. 
[01:22:30]  Well, I have been sending out my resume.  Diane, do you know how many jobs come across my desk that I need to fill with people who  are unemployed, who are willing to work?  How long have you been unemployed?  I've been unemployed since May.  Since May.  Why aren't you working for a temporary company like I offered you to come in and make $10  an hour?  At least nine months, right?  At that time, she could add another kid she can't care for.  And I think...  What?  So why didn't you call...  Why didn't you call...  Come on, let me stop that.  Hey, Diane, why didn't you call her?  You knew you could have called her. 
[01:23:00]  Why didn't you call her?  Well, you know what?  You know what?  I have to get her phone number again, and I will call her.  No, why didn't you the first time?  Right.  I don't...  What's the problem?  Are you waiting for your welfare to run out?  No.  Why didn't you call her?  Why?  Why didn't you call me?  There's a hundred other temporary companies out there.  I have been bringing applications.  It's just that I have to be kind of like local.  When does your welfare run out, Lady Di?  Because I don't have a vehicle right now.  When does your welfare run out?  When does it run out?  Yeah.  I don't know.  In about a few months, I guess.  About a few months, I guess.  You know what's really annoying about your living, guys? 
[01:23:30]  Is that I listen to you saying you need to dumb up the show because you've got really  stupid people listening.  Yeah.  You don't.  You have idiots like Diane who come in and waste the whole show's time because nobody  wants to hear it anymore.  There you go.  Thank you, Julie.  You're welcome.  Don't try helping her anymore.  I don't want anyone helping this lady.  You know, how am I going to get there?  Let's go to your partner in crime, Marion.  Marion, happy birthday.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Jim.  Hey, thank you.  Hi, Marion.  Happy birthday.  Thanks.  How old are you?  41.  Oh, 41.  41 years old.  Today. 
[01:24:00]  And I'm doing good.  Hey, listen.  Diane is going to school with the job training program.  Yeah.  Because I had to go to it a couple years back.  Oh, we have a quote from her teacher.  Tract, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son.  And they do have job listings at this place.  I'm trying to explain that to them.  But if you can't get, listen to me, guys.  If you can't get transportation to get to this place, then they wait a week and they try to find you something else.  Everybody. 
[01:24:30]  Everybody.  Let's get into it.  Get stobie.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Everybody.  Everybody.  Ha.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Ha.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Ha.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Yeah.  Let's get retarded in here.  Don't fuck with me. 
[01:25:00]  Don't fuck with me.  Yeah.  Drew Boogie adding a little bit to that.  Very nice.  Hey, that's a cool song.  I like that.  Very nice.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever, dude.  Hey, you still have Diana on the phone.  Yeah.  I'm still here.  Diana, where do...  This lady, Julia, that wanted to give you a job.  Where is she from?  No, no, but I can't travel far.  And she should know that.  Where is she from now?  Where did she want to give you a job at?  Well, I don't know.  Well, you never told me about this lady.  That's what I'm asking.  No, no, no.  She, you know, she called up a while ago, right? 
[01:25:30]  And I think I tried to get her phone number.  I don't even think I got her phone number.  Well, get her phone number, but it's local.  No.  We can take a bus.  No.  Go for it.  No.  I told Julie never to call again as far as the Lady Di situation goes.  Because she doesn't drive, guys.  Look, she has to go locally because she's got a bus.  Wait, Mary, hold on a minute.  I can't have, you know, a job that's far away, and you know that.  No, she's got to take a bus.  Everywhere she goes, she's got a bus that'll walk it now.  Hey, Mary, we finally found out the story of the father of Lady Di's son. 
[01:26:00]  No.  Yeah, we finally found that out.  Listen, guys, what did you find out?  Because Patty didn't know anything.  Because Patty didn't know Vinny.  We found out that he stepped in front of a choo-choo train.  Yeah, but listen, that was years ago, okay?  And people have problems.  So what happens if people have problems?  They get sick, and what happens?  They get sick, and they jump in front of choo-choo trains.  Let me tell you one thing.  Patty can open up her big friggin' mouth, okay?  What?  Patty should not open up her mouth. 
[01:26:30]  Well, Patty was telling everybody who would listen.  Well, Patty shouldn't say nothing, because Patty's wife wasn't all fun and cherries, either.  Yeah, but Patty was just kind of goofing on the whole thing.  Yeah, Patty thought it was very funny.  There's nothing funny about it.  Not against Patty, guys.  Listen, not against Patty, because I think she's a cool person, and I like her.  But you know what?  Her life isn't, you know, a fun game.  She's got her life together.  Huh?  I can't believe I'm sticking up for Stalker Patty, but she's got her life together.  Yeah, now she does, yeah.  We're happy for her.  But, look, Diane was doing good.  And so what?  You lose a job years ago, a couple years ago, you fall back, you get up, and you get started 
[01:27:00]  again.  Well, exactly.  Pick yourself up by your bootstraps.  And that's what she's trying to do.  Pick yourself up by your horseshoes.  Job training program.  All right, listen.  She really is.  All right, hold on a minute.  I'm going to get a job.  Hold on.  I'm telling you right now.  Someone wants to say hi to her.  You've been saying that for months.  We've been doing this show for four months.  I've been looking for a job, and, you know, somehow, some way, they just, you know, they  don't...  You're coming up on a year.  You're coming up on a year of unemployment. 
[01:27:30]  No, it's not coming up on a year.  I'm sick of paying for you to live, you fat pig.  It is a year.  It is a year.  What kind of an ass doesn't work for nine or 26 months?  Well, you know, it happens.  Hey, unemployed asshole, I live in New Jersey, and I pay for your beer.  Mel won't let me work.  You drunk.  Well, what would you like me to do?  A stupid drunk.  I can't really...  Hey, shut up.  A stupid drunk.  I pay for your beer money.  Get a fucking job.  Who's that?  You know what you should do?  Oh, it's Frenchy's brother again.  You know what you should do, stupid? 
[01:28:00]  You should work as a waitress in the stress factory, because this weekend, Jimmy Norton will  be playing 11th and the 12th, today and tomorrow.  And you can reach the box office at 888-541-HA-HA.  So you know what you should do?  Put on your drunk laughing hat and laugh yourself into a fucking drunken tizzy.  Now, shut up.  Norton, when are the showtimes?  Because I'm going.  I think it's 8 and 10.30, but it's in the Eatontown one, not the New Brunswick one.  Eatontown, New Jersey.  I know. 
[01:28:30]  I'm going to the late show, bro.  I'm going to support Jimmy Norton tonight.  Oh, cool.  I hope you'll be there tonight.  I'm going to go see you tomorrow night, so that should be a good show.  You've got to come up and say hello, man.  You've got to come up and say hello.  I absolutely will.  I will see you tomorrow night.  And a drunken jerk-off.  I hate your guts.  Henri, Henri.  Thanks, Henri.  He left.  He's great.  I want him to call her the C-word today.  We don't break out the C-word often, but man, I want you to hear it today.  Hello, cow.  Maren, we're still on the air.  Hey, I'm going to Atlantic City later on, guys.  I wish we'd have to win some money. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, for your birthday?  Yeah, me and my husband are going this afternoon.  How come you're not bringing Di with you?  Why don't you bring your friend?  Me and my husband are going.  It's my birthday, so we're going down until tomorrow morning.  Oh, any hanky-panky going to take place in that room?  Oh, wow.  All right, there you go.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon knot?  Hey.  They've been doing it for years.  Oh, the balloon knot?  Wait, you have balloon knot sex?  I don't care.  Marion, you have balloon knot sex?  I know. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  We've been having sex for years.  Come on.  No, no, but you give up the old back door.  Well, Marion's couple don't have sex.  Come on.  Do you do the old dirt road?  I'm not saying what I do.  The old dirt road, huh?  Do you talk dirty to him?  I'm not saying.  Are you vocal?  That's not a dirt.  I'm not saying anything.  You must give the sloppiest BJs with that voice.  She's probably talked through the whole thing.  No, they're not sloppy.  They're not sloppy.  Believe me.  Whoa.  Wow, Marion's a horny one. 
[01:30:00]  She's risky.  She's a firecracker.  Marion's 41 and looking for some action tonight from her husband, Joe.  Hey, maybe.  You never know.  I'll never tell.  Joe's going to give it to you tonight, huh, Marion?  Well, I hope.  A little gambling.  What do you play down there in the casino?  Slots.  Sure, slots.  Slots.  And then he'll nail your slot when you get back to the room.  We'll go to a hockey game down there, too, because there's no hockey here, so we'll go  into a game.  But you guys are pretty stupid.  I would think you would just play black or red. 
[01:30:30]  He likes the wheels.  Yeah?  And I like the slot machines.  You go to a hockey game?  Yeah, there's minor league hockey down in Aces, so we'll go into a game tonight for a couple  hours.  Oh, that's a hell of a birthday present.  Joe is bringing you to Atlantic City to go to a minor league hockey game for your birthday.  What are the things she's going to do?  About everything.  What's that, Di?  I'm going to be up all night tonight, so I'm going to gamble the whole time I'm there.  Di, what'd you say?  I don't gamble the whole time I'm there.  That's how you lose your money.  That's one of the things that she will do when she's in Atlantic City, but that's not 
[01:31:00]  the only thing she's going to do.  When I went in November, I came home with $300.  Di, what else is she going to do?  What?  What else is she going to do?  Well, she's going to be going to go to casinos and stuff like that.  So what's going on, Marion?  What are you going to do tonight?  Not much.  Not much.  How's everything going to be, guys?  Di, what do you think she's going to do there?  Hey, how is Mardi Gras?  I was pretty good.  What do you do in Atlantic City?  Hello?  What do you do in Atlantic City?  Marion?  Walk around.  Lady Di needs a job.  Lady Di, so what about this job of yours?  She's not going to gamble very much.  Lady Di, what about this job of yours? 
[01:31:30]  What job of mine?  So what are you going to do?  I'm training program.  Marion, what time are you going down?  I'm going down about one.  Lady Di, so are you going to look for a job today?  Probably, yeah.  There's a holiday today.  What do you have to...  No, no, no.  You look in the paper.  Marion, places are closed today.  It's a holiday.  That's why I'm off to work.  Right.  Every day is a holiday for her.  Yeah, please.  Then you circle the ads, and then you call them up.  All right, hold on.  Every day is a holiday for Lady Di.  Oh, come on.  No, no, no.  All right, hold on a minute.  Oh, no.  I've been going to the school.  Andre, let it fly, brother. 
[01:32:00]  Make it creative, please.  Hello, guys.  I forgot to say before, eatabullet.com.  So, anyway, are you going to play the warning, or should I just do what I got to do?  I don't know.  We warned, but make it creative.  Lady Di?  Yes?  Andre has something to say to you.  Sure, go ahead.  Diane, are you there?  I'm right here.  I just want to tell you something, okay?  No, you...  Okay, go ahead.  Okay.  Your young son, the one that they took away from you because you're an unfit mother and 
[01:32:30]  he'll never be back...  What are you talking about?  Thank God every day that he does not live with a drunken conter like you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Oh, my God.  No.  Let me turn away from me.  I said, no.  Yes.  No one of this Andre guy.  Where the hell did you get him?  He's not Frenchy.  Where did you get him from?  He's trying to imitate Frenchy.  He's good.  All right, listen.  He's not good.  He's Frenchy's brother.  Listen, Marion, happy birthday to you.  Thank you.  Happy birthday.  Say, hey, Lady Di, what did your husband do for your birthday? 
[01:33:00]  Step in front of a train?  No.  No.  He wasn't married to him.  Oh.  Oh.  Marion.  That was a birthday gift to himself.  Hey.  Marion, happy birthday.  Nothing like that.  Thank you.  Have fun in Vegas.  Say hi to Joe for all of us, okay?  Okay.  And you got the music, cute Anthony?  I hope to see you guys in a couple weeks.  Marion, we look forward to your visits.  Come by and say hi soon, okay?  I'm going to try to maybe...  I'll be by, too.  Uh, no, don't bother, Lady Di.  Marion, we'd love to see you, though, okay? 
[01:33:30]  Thank you.  I want to come up to you whenever I get a chance.  Anytime, Marion.  All right.  And me, too.  Bye, girls.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Hit it, Drew.  Bye, guys. 
[01:34:00]  Okay.  Okay.  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into, uh...  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup. 
[01:34:30]  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages...  Savages.  ...that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Wow.  That's really nice.  What's going against the wall?  Come on.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton. 
[01:35:00]  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  In Amity.  XM 202.  Now describe to me what marcelous fossils look like.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha. 
[01:35:30]  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Drew Boogie spinning for us today.  Live in studio.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  I forgot about that.  We gotta get them back in to do movie lines again.  Oh. 
[01:36:00]  They were doing a whole scene from Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction.  God damn.  That was funny.  Mossless Wasseless.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  That big mouth trying to wrap that fat tongue around those words.  Now describe to me what Mossless Wasseless looks like.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha. 
[01:36:30]  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Lady Di's a waste, but Marion, man, she makes me laugh hard.  She's got to come back in to do the movie lines.  We'll match her up with somebody.  Some people are suggesting jobs for Lady Di and taking a couple of them and putting them together.  We should have her hand out XM little flyers in Times Square with one of those sandwich boards around her fat neck.  And say, look, if you don't have a job, we'll give her minimum wage to stand out there in the cold for a few hours 
[01:37:00]  and hand these things out with a big sandwich board.  That's not a bad idea.  When it gets warmer, here's a better idea.  You have her in a bikini.  Hand the Iopia Anthony Snickers.  We'll give her an extra $100 if she walks around in a bikini.  Just warmer.  More of our money to degrade people with.  How fun is that?  Why don't we do that?  Yeah, do it.  She needs money.  Anthony, our old pal Jay Moore was cursing like a drunken sailor on TV during the Super Bowl. 
[01:37:30]  Really?  We got the audio.  Yeah, he's on live TV in Florida.  How come I didn't hear about this?  In Jacksonville.  Did they get fined or something?  I think it's getting to the point.  So many people are starting to curse on radio and on TV.  I think the FCC is, believe it or not, just going, ah!  Do you think the FCC is making announcements like, we figured, fuck it.  Yeah, right.  Oh, they did, okay.  At first, I think they were concerned, but now it's, I mean, it seems like every week  there's another person cursing on TV or cursing on the radio, and it's just a curse word. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  It's very hard for them to fined for one curse, is what I hear also.  They've tried, you know, and they're trying to, but they don't usually fined anybody for a curse.  A lot of people on radio slip.  Opie slipped once in Boston.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah.  It's the F word.  Oh, yeah.  Did the FCC get a complaint?  No, no.  But even if they do, if it's not done in a way that, you know, you're presenting it like to be shocking, 
[01:38:30]  or, uh, they usually don't find.  Like if it just slips.  Mistake.  What are you going to do?  Well, then, uh, they replayed it while we were in New Orleans with my whole story about Starfucker by the  Rolling Stones.  Right, right.  You know, the F word went on the air.  God, I, uh, somebody figured it out like 70 times.  Yep.  Because I was, uh, too busy talking to a Buffalo Betty, and I turned down the monitor in the  studio while this song was playing.  I had no idea it was a curse song.  Ha, ha.  Uh, well, anyway, here's Jay Moore cursing on live TV in Florida. 
[01:39:00]  Well, our friends over there, they partner with the NFL alumni on the, uh, Super Bowl charity  golf classic, where the players get to dress casual and have fun, and the fans stand around  and look for autographs, and they go home with bruises.  You guys don't, uh, I like golf.  It's the only sport I could actually, you know, beat Dan Marino in.  What?  How come every time anyone has their name mentioned, you guys run for the hills?  Oh, my God.  He told a joke with Dan.  Oh, oh.  You know how Dan likes his juice, how he gets. 
[01:39:30]  Who gives a shit?  I made a Dan Marino joke.  Screw Marino.  He's a first ballot Hall of Famer.  You think he gives a shit about my golf joke?  You sissies.  Okay.  All right.  We, uh, we have no control over what's said there, so our apologies for what is there.  That's when you need the old seven-second delay, Alan, to, uh, to make sure you don't get those  things.  The old delay button.  So, uh, again, our apologies there that that has occurred, but that is, uh, an event in  which, uh, most things do happen, apparently. 
[01:40:00]  That's right.  Well, we do have plenty of Super Bowl parties going on all over the place in First Coast News.  There you have it.  Uh, but we do.  Let's get out of this as quickly as possible.  Uh, we apologize that you had to hear the word shit.  That's the best.  Oh, god damn, I said it.  Fuck.  Oh, shit.  Oh, son.  That's the best part of these anchors.  They, they don't know how to improvise, so when something goes horribly wrong like that,  they are like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Oh, please don't fire me.  I didn't do it.  I had nothing to do with it.  Oh, yeah, because, you know, they, they're, they're afraid now that they'll just clean 
[01:40:30]  house.  Anyone that was on camera, even around the curse, fired.  Get them out.  What did Jay expect?  He said, I like golf.  It's the only sport I can beat Marino in.  What did he expect?  A laugh break?  He was, yeah.  Awful one.  I think he was expecting a laugh break.  You can hear in his voice, he, uh, he was eating it, and he was starting to feel uncomfortable,  and I think when that happens, you start, uh, thinking.  You panic a little.  The curse has come out.  Yeah, you panic a little bit, and then you start using different language.  Yeah, because, yeah, it's just, as a comic, you're natural.  I'm just thinking, like, just to, oh, go, oh. 
[01:41:00]  Kind of lapse into it.  Yeah.  Eating it.  Oh, that's such an awful way to put it.  He's up there eating it.  He wasn't getting huge laughs.  I mean, he is a funny guy, but the, I mean, you know, tell it like you hear it, though.  He wasn't killing there.  And you could hear in his voice, he was getting a little, uh, a little, uh, nerves by that.  You can just talk sometimes.  If you're bombing on a show like that or whatever, you just, just talk, answer a question.  Who cares?  Just answer it legit.  What was he doing up there?  I mean, what was the context of that show?  I don't know.  Because apparently some news had gone live to that event. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know.  Was it just some kind of...  Maybe it was their, it might have been their, you know, their local pregame or something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, if Jay, you know, decided to be our friend again.  Ah, and call in.  Can't wait for that moment where he decides he's going to be our friend again, and then maybe  we could ask him these questions.  Ask him all the questions we've had for him.  Looks like Jay got a little too big since we got fired.  Oh, you think that's it?  You've only been on for four months.  I mean...  Dude, whatever.  I know he listens to replays. 
[01:42:00]  Jay, whatever.  If you want to call, call.  If you don't, then fine.  Stop this teasing where you have your buddies call Ben, and oh, he might be calling Friday.  Oh, we can't wait.  Today might be the day that you call us, Jay.  Who cares?  I don't care.  You either call or you don't.  It's been a soap opera with Ben and Jay's posse.  You know, he might call.  Oh, well, he overslept.  Well, he was going to call Monday, but he had to go to San Diego. 
[01:42:30]  There's always an excuse.  It's like, dude, you know what?  Don't even bother.  Who cares?  Maybe it's like Lewis.  Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.  No, it's not, because it's been a thing that's been going back and forth.  Ben will tell you.  What happened?  Lewis's scumbag publicist wouldn't pass on the news?  Well, that was legit, yeah.  I don't know.  I'm sure it was.  Yeah, yeah.  It didn't seem like Lewis Black to not be a part of the show or call or anything.  Lewis actually put it in perspective.  He was like...  He goes, who am I that I'm not going on other people's shows? 
[01:43:00]  And it's like, true.  It's like, why would Lewis do that?  He's not that kind of guy.  The publicists just didn't tell him, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Publicists, and I'm making this for the record, a blanket statement.  You are worthless, and you do what you do because you couldn't cut the mustard on the entertainment side.  Yeah.  That's exactly why you do what you do.  So you have to shuttle around talented people and speak for them because no one will speak for you because you don't have talent.  I hate publicists.  They are lying, spinning sacks of shit.  Wow. 
[01:43:30]  Overprotective.  Do you have one?  No.  No.  For what?  You will never have one?  For what?  Hey, here's Jim Norton.  Check him out.  And I go to some soundbite.  Check him out.  I'm bombing doing a Marino joke.  The other big news here in New York City is Jason Giambi, who said absolutely nothing.  There was this huge...  Everyone was waiting.  There was this huge press conference at Yankee Stadium, Giambi.  He admitted, I guess, in testimony or whatever, the investigation that he... 
[01:44:00]  Grand jury testimony.  That he used steroids.  So this was his first press conference since that info came out.  So everyone was expecting him to talk about it a little bit.  To fess up and say, yeah, I did these steroids.  I'm not on them anymore.  You know, I'm going to work through this.  I'm going to go through this thing.  Keep our chin off.  And apparently he didn't.  He was very evasive, blamed a lot on pending litigation, and didn't really even fess up.  Never used the word steroids. 
[01:44:30]  Then why did he even have a press conference?  Because he's really hated in New York now.  And I think he figured a little FaceTime will help him out.  The best is him getting out of his SUV in front of the press conference and having to smile and sign every autograph and take every picture with the fans.  Because he just knows the second he walks out into the stadium, he's just going to be pelted and booed.  So now he's trying to make up for it by being so nice to every single fan. 
[01:45:00]  And you know he's just pulling up to that thing, sees the fans out there, and just goes, oh, I got to smile and wave and sign and take pictures with these mutants.  You wait, Dutl.  He starts like, if his first couple of bats he strikes out, grounds out, or pops up, oh, is he going to hear it?  Oh, yeah.  If he's hitting the ball hard, people will be like, all right, well, whatever, he's still a good player.  But if he starts, like, fouling out weekly, oh, he is finished.  He's not even going to hit 12 homers this year. 
[01:45:30]  Dude, I never wanted him.  Go back on the, I never wanted, I wanted Nick Johnson.  He's retarded looking with high socks.  High on base percentage.  Young kid, that's who I wanted.  And someone's going to take out Jose Canseco.  This guy is just.  Hey, Jose, keep your mouth shut.  A babbling idiot.  Yeah.  He's got a book out that no one's happy about.  He's going to go on the talk show circuit and basically, you know.  He's naming names.  Oh, he's naming names.  He said that he once did steroids in a bathroom with Mark McGuire and Jason Giambi.  Yeah, yeah.  I read that over the weekend. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  And he's like, everyone knew.  And then he's like, then he's saying, like, when, he played for Texas, right?  I believe so.  I was reading over the weekend, I think, he played for the Rangers, and that's when George  Bush had, you know, some say in the Rangers' own part of the team or most of the team,  whatever his ownership was, I forget.  And basically, Jose Canseco goes, oh, yeah, the president knew that the guys on the Rangers  were doing steroids.  Really?  So then they had to get a comment from George Bush and, you know, basically saying, you 
[01:46:30]  know, I've always been against steroids.  What else is he going to say?  The government's going to take you out, Jose.  Are you insane?  Assassinated.  Did you hear that Canseco blew the, like, apparently this guy's mother from Panzerfaust  was doing steroids?  He was the one that blew that up.  So here's Jason Giambi from the press conference yesterday.  The reason I'm here today is, you know, because I'm a man and, you know, I've made mistakes  and, you know, I'm here to, you know, sit in front of you guys and tell you that, but 
[01:47:00]  I'm sorry and, you know, I'm going to work as hard as I can to be back to the player that  I am.  You know, I've been working my butt off this offseason, doing two workouts a day in the  mornings.  I've been running, hitting and throwing.  You know, I wish I would have done a lot of things differently.  I really do.  And as I look back and all I can say is I'm sorry.  He's so wrong.  I wish I did things differently.  And then when he says, I really do, that means he doesn't really do. 
[01:47:30]  That means I really don't, but I'm saying I really do.  Because I got caught.  I want you to think I really do.  Yeah, I got caught.  Yeah.  As soon as you start with that other stuff, like I really do, that means you're not sincere  whatsoever.  Can I tell you one thing?  Big Kev sounded more sincere on television this morning.  Talking about the drapes?  Yes.  I'm excited about the drapes.  Those saggity display in Central Park.  It'd be more masculine if they just hung cocks from the trees in Central Park.  I thought that's what they were doing.  Yeah, weren't they?  I thought they were hanging colored and lit up cocks all around the park. 
[01:48:00]  And you have to put your hand behind your back and rollerblade while they bounce off  your face and chin for 23 miles?  Ugh, Christo, I hope he dies in a boating accident.  Faggot with an awful fucking rooster wife.  I hope he gets choked by one of those drapes.  It's a windy day and he's walking, checking it out, and he gets tangled in one.  Yeah, his wife makes me nauseous.  Stay on the top of a barn, you cryptic whore.  What do you think of the gates, honey? 
[01:48:30]  Oh, awful.  Awful cockhead.  The best is that the park is just filled with nerds helping to put up this display.  Big Kevin is diction.  I'm excited.  After Big Kevin's appearance on TV, I don't think he could ever be on our show again, man.  Too geeky.  Too geeky for us. 
[01:49:00]  Too geeky?  No, we love it.  How many people are going to rollerblade and maybe injure themselves hitting one of these  things?  Not enough.  People rollerblade on those paths, right?  Yeah, no.  I guarantee, because it's New York, it's New York City, I will guarantee you some lawsuit  will be brought against the city because of this artwork.  Or someone's going to rollerblade into it, hit it, someone's going to say that it gave a criminal  some coverage, which then resulted in them being injured or raped or something. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, there'll be graffiti on them.  Well, that's why it's made out of that space-age polymer.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  It wipes right off.  I'm sure there's a multi-million dollar cleaning crew that's got to go through every day.  And then the NYPD, we know the NYPD.  There's hundreds of these guys that have to go guard the gates now.  Yeah, a little overtime for them.  Cost the city some cake right there.  Yeah, enjoy.  Enjoy the artwork.  All right, let's go to another clip from Giambi.  Well, I can tell you that, you know, like any situation when the San Francisco Chronicle article came out, 
[01:50:00]  we certainly looked at it to see what it meant to us and what the situation meant.  But, you know, we have not taken any action off of that.  They basically want to get rid of him, but he has a guaranteed contract.  That's what that's saying.  You know something?  It's a little hard for these teams to start throwing these guys off also. 
[01:50:30]  And that is because they all knew what the hell was going on.  It's very hard for them to then toss these guys because you get a guy a little disgruntled that he's thrown off the team.  I'm sure he'll go run off and say, you know, get me a press conference because I'm going to expose all these sons of bitches,  knew everything that was going on.  I got names, dates, places.  Because, you know, they're all in the same boat here.  The owners, the players, everyone knew what was going on. 
[01:51:00]  You've got to be stupid not to think Mark McGuire wasn't taking something.  Giambi, you looked at him.  Stop it.  You see pictures of Mark McGuire now?  Yeah.  Completely different person.  Of course.  How about Vaughn?  Oh, well, he's not working out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  But didn't he get tested all last year and still hit a lot of home runs?  Was he tested last year?  Like all last year?  Why was he being tested when there was no steroid testing?  No, no.  I'm saying, wasn't there something like all this past season?  He obviously couldn't have been taking them for some reason. 
[01:51:30]  I don't know.  For some reason, I thought he was under the microscope all last season and still hit a lot.  Yeah, I don't know.  Somebody might know more than that.  There wasn't any testing, though.  Yeah, Lady Di knows more than you about that.  Jesus.  Well, she's a Beatles expert.  Didn't he do something last year when he was maybe heading home?  Something with lights in the park.  Well, I actually asked Lady Di one time which one of the Beatles got shot in front of the  Dakota and she got on the second guess.  Oh, okay.  How about that?  So, I mean, if that's not expertise.  Did you see Paul McCartney at the Super Bowl? 
[01:52:00]  Didn't Ringo look fat?  You think Brian?  Number.  Samoan?  No?  Nothing?  You think Brian Cashman wants to pay Jason Giambi all that money?  How much is his contract?  It's ridiculous.  This guy's going to hit 12, 11 homers next year.  Tops.  Yeah.  If Cashman could, he would have got rid of him.  And his stupid contract.  But he can't.  Well, now they're going to have to look for it.  For the reasons Anthony was saying.  Yeah, forget it.  All of them knew what was going on.  They all knew.  It was great for the game.  It was great for their teams. 
[01:52:30]  And now they're going to have to do something about it.  All right.  And now here's Joe Torre.  It's going to be something that's going to be tough for him.  Because, you know, I think we're all sensitive to criticism.  But he understands that's what's going to be out there.  Yeah.  Joe Torre talking about the fans.  You know the chant's going to be steroids.  Oh, that's a good one.  Unless he starts hitting home runs.  If he comes out and starts hitting home runs.  That'll shut them right up.  He's not going to be hitting home runs. 
[01:53:00]  I'm just saying that Michael Jackson can walk out to the plate with a kid dangling off his mule.  And if he hits it out of the park, he's a hero.  He's got to get used to a completely different body, you know, than he's used to.  And then the pressure that everyone is going to place on him.  You'll get it.  This guy, he's going to be the biggest choke next year for the Yankees.  I think so, too.  Let's see.  Next year.  Hell, it's right around the corner now.  Has he ever won a big game, though?  Like, every year he's been great.  But, I mean, has he ever really done anything in the playoffs?  I've never been impressed with you.  No. 
[01:53:30]  No.  All right.  I heard he pulls trains with his wife.  I heard they go to some strip club and pick up chicks.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I really respect that.  Yeah, how about that?  How about that?  And this segs perfectly into Valentine's Day.  Ooh.  And you can't bang, you know, another chick with your wife.  Well, we got something that...  Bring a bear into the bed.  Ooh, the steroid bear.  It's just as good.  No, we can't make up bears.  Oh, no bear names?  Don't make up bears.  They don't like that.  Okay.  It's against the rules.  Yes. 
[01:54:00]  Valentine's Day is Monday, people.  And you don't want to spend your weekend in the mall.  Oh, the mall.  Got three words for you.  Vermont Teddy Bear.

In honor of our little baseball talk, we're going to play the Earl Weaver clip.  Earl Weaver.  Hotty mouth Earl Weaver.  And then Drew Boogie.  He's spinning live in studio here.  He'll do a little something after the Earl Weaver.  And then we'll be back, okay?  Right.  Now, the manager's corner.  With the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager, the Oil's Earl Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's six best. 
[01:55:30]  Your area Oldsmobile dealers.  Anderson Olds.  Schaefer & Storminger Olds.  Lee Oldsmobile.  Metro Olds.  City Olds.  And Stuberger Olds.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl.  That certainly is an answer from Frederick Merrill.  Wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis, getting picked off, trying to steal, 
[01:56:00]  getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark, and you  can't make any goddamn mistakes.  Well, certainly, this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C. wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated  hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy watching 
[01:56:30]  a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and break  one open in their fucking mind.  So if this cocksucker'd mind his own business, and let me manage the fucking team, we'd be  a lot better off.  Well, certainly, you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball,  Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lane's coming from, rather  than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from. 
[01:57:00]  If she'd get her ass out of the fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn  street, she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go fuck yourself, and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball  Fucking Network. 
[01:57:30]  Like this.  Like this.  Like this.  Well, you know, I've heard a lot of radio over the years. 
[01:58:00]  This is probably the worst.  Way back in the middle 60s, there was a small station outside of Moline, Illinois.  I believe it was WRCW.  I'm not sure of the call letters.  1590 Day Timer.  Signed off at Sunrise.  Sunset, rather.  They were pretty bad. 
[01:58:30]  They were pretty, pretty darn bad.  But this is probably worse.  Oh!  Agapame to Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM202.  Stay out of the bushes. 
[01:59:00]  Cancel all appointments.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Drew Boogie spinning live in the studio.  Something a little different today.  Go F. Yourself. 
[01:59:30]  Go F. Yourself.  Man, we got a great opportunity for Assault on the Media today.  Yeah.  All the morning shows are in Central Park, and they just keep panning the gates.  The gates.  By the artist Christo.  We got to send someone.  I know.  I mean, Katie Couric is out there, and the dude from Good Morning America.  Where's Danny?  I don't know where Danny is today.  Danny's answering the phones.  Danny's the guy.  Danny. 
[02:00:00]  So, Anthony, what's going on with Corey Feldman?  Well, I guess he's now saying that maybe something inappropriate did happen with Michael Jackson.  Now, for years, for years, people have been asking for Corey Feldman.  Got to say hi to Joey.  Look at that.  I didn't even see.  Joey.  Joey Paisano.  Good, good.  From Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  How you been?  Been good, been good.  Go down there and ask for a free glass of wine, and you'll get it, right? 
[02:00:30]  Yes, you will.  That's right.  Food's awesome.  I was there for the first time in a while, about a month ago.  I had a great time.  So, ONA sent you.  You get a glass of wine on the house.  Yes, you do.  You still do.  Still.  To this day.  You don't have to buy dinner.  Just get wine and walk back out.  Oh, yeah.  Good luck to you.  You do know it's in Little Italy's restaurant, right?  Right.  Are you insane?  We'll get you at the corner. 
[02:01:00]  And Joey's Eagles lost in the Super Bowl there.  Yes.  Big Eagles fan.  It was very funny because everyone knows that Joey, he's from New York.  Yep.  Born and bred, but decides he likes the Eagles.  I still don't get that one, but major Eagles fan, and they finally make it into the Super  Bowl there.  And shut up, Ben.  Oh, Ben, just cackling.  Dynasty.  Dynasty.  Maybe if you guys had Tom Brady.  Tom Brady.  He can do anything. 
[02:01:30]  So, it was funny because we all called Joey.  Yeah.  Wishing him luck because his team was in the Super Bowl.  How many phone calls did you get?  Seriously.  I got phone calls from people I didn't even remember that called me up.  Yeah.  Hey.  Because everyone, you know.  He's finally in the Super Bowl.  Everyone knows.  Joey, Eagles.  Simple as that.  How many calls did you get after the Eagles lost the Super Bowl?  I haven't spoken to anyone since the Super Bowl.  Everyone is scared to call Joey.  All my phones were broken.  No one has called.  Joey actually had to go to a phone booth to see how the game turned out. 
[02:02:00]  And he got, no, no, it's over.  They're gone.  They're gone.  What, the Eagles?  Sorry, there was nothing we could do about it.  They're gone.  Smashing the receiver on the phone.  That's a shame.  McNabb stunk.  I was rooting for Philly, too, man.  He was bad that day.  He was.  He was.  He looks like Mumia Abu-Jamal, and he throws just as well.  It sucks. 
[02:02:30]  Maybe next year, right?  It's been 24 years.  I can wait another year.  Yeah, another year.  What's another year?  Come on.  Joey's like, there she is, Katie Couric.  Perfect opportunity for herself in the media.  There it is.  Imagine Hawk running out behind her like that.  That's right.  Doing zigzagging between the poles like a little obstacle course.  That would be very, very funny.  All right.  Well, Joey's here, hanging with us.  We're talking about Corey Feldman.  So, I guess he's been subpoenaed or something by the grand jury here? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Or the actual, what is it?  Are we past the grand jury now?  Yeah, yeah.  So, he's going to testify in the Michael Jackson case?  Yep.  And for years, he was saying nothing happened.  He had had his relationship with Michael Jackson when he was a little kid.  Been to Neverland.  Hung out.  Michael Jackson took him all over the place.  They used to dress alike.  He'd put the little hat and the glove on, and they'd dance together, and everything was  fine and dandy.  But now, now he's saying, hmm, now that I think about it, inappropriate behavior is inappropriate 
[02:03:30]  behavior.  I think you remember it.  I think you remember certain things.  If it's just Michael Jackson taking you around Neverland, putting you on rides and things,  that's one thing.  But anything other than that, like maybe magazines.  You either sat on a dick or you didn't.  There you go.  It's pretty easy to figure out.  Did you sit on a dick? 
[02:04:00]  11, 12 years later, he's now thinking, well, you know what?  No, I'm thinking that there were some suspicious things that were going on.  Yeah.  He just wants a little FaceTime.  And he's getting it as we speak.  ABC News.  You know?  I mean, this guy is attention starved.  He did the surreal life thing, and then faded back into obscurity.  Yep.  Wow, they're showing some more of Christo's projects.  Oh, there's the big umbrella that killed people.  Those are the umbrellas that killed some person. 
[02:04:30]  And here we get these stupid gates in Central Park.  Anyway.  Ah!  Oh, they just showed his wife.  She's just awful.  Look at that hair color.  It is a, that's a shade of red.  I don't even know what it is.  Now you understand why he's just traveling the world, you know, setting up big, huge umbrellas  and wrapping buildings.  He doesn't want to go to bed with this chick.  He just wants to see something that's more of a spectacle than that awful thing he's married to.  Oh, my God.  She is atrocious. 
[02:05:00]  Look at that shot.  Oh, God.  You got the, the Christo and the gates.  Why aren't we there?  Why aren't we there?  I'm just making a mockery of the whole thing.  Mocking everything.  We need to mock, mock, mock, mock, mock.  That scene needs a shit dick sign.  Donkey sausage sign.  Right.  Oh, donkey sausage sign.  Well, hurry up.  They're off the air at 9.  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Let's go.  Let's go, guys.  Let's go.  They'll be going there all day.  Donkey sausage sign, Eric. 
[02:05:30]  Anthony, they're deploying.  They're deploying.  They're deploying.  Yeah, because at least you can't get in trouble for that.  Or a little Connor.  No, get the donkey sausage.  Do donkey sausage and do one of those wows that we have in the office, right?  We got them.  All right.  All set.  Hawk is on his way.  All right.  We're deploying.  Deploying.  Anyone else want to deploy?  They're in Central Park right now.  Take this, Eric.  A lot of news crews in Central Park going live.  He nailed you.  Oh, my God.  Now I've got to sit here and wait as Eric writes another note instead of jumping on 
[02:06:00]  Mike real fast.  What are you writing down?  Just get on the mic, Eric.  You can talk.  Nothing for him.  Ooh.  All right.  I'm sorry, then.  Nothing for you, Opie.  All right.  Corey Feldman.  Yeah.  So now he's getting FaceTime and he doesn't really have anything, really.  He has no real details.  No.  Just stupid crap.  Things that might have been inappropriate.  And things that I think were inappropriate.  I think so.  If you're Michael Jackson and your whole game here is the fact that you're just helping  children. 
[02:06:30]  You know, you love children so much that you're helping them out.  You know, he takes terminally ill kids and brings them to Neverland.  And if they're just riding on rides and everything, that's fine.  But anything more than that and anything remotely sexual is inappropriate.  Let's go to the Corey Feldman audio.  More of our exclusive Corey Feldman police tapes.  Yeah.  Do the 1993 reporting suggest cops were on a witch hunt to trap Michael Jackson since  his first case?  Jake Lillett Mitchell says the tapes could show the King of Pop is the victim of a hidden 
[02:07:00]  agenda.  Is your belief in him and your love for him getting in the way of you telling us anything?  Everything I've told you is true and there's, I mean, nothing happened.  Corey Feldman in 1993 grilled by Santa Barbara Sheriff Sergeant Deborah Linden and a detective  about the actor's close friendship with Michael Jackson.  Sometimes the two had even dressed alike, but on the date obtained exclusively by CJ, Corey 
[02:07:30]  insists over and over the friendship was totally innocent, while the cops repeatedly expressed  suspicion for more than an hour.  I'm so concerned that if something happened, you're not going to tell us because it would  be so hard to tell us or if you tried to something happened.  No.  They want to hear what they want to hear, not what the witness wants to say.  Noted, Beverly Hills criminal defense attorney Jay Jaffe says the actor, who gained fame in  Stand By Me and The Goonies, certainly sounds believable on the tape. 
[02:08:00]  You don't know how many times I have racked my brain and gone, is there something I'm forgetting?  Is there something, you know, that I'm thinking, you know, didn't happen, but it really did?  If I could find something, I would love to be able to tell you, but nothing else.  Jaffe says while the investigators on the tape did not break the law, Jackson's defense team  could use the cops' repeated, aggressive questioning of the actor to bolster their claim  that D.A. Tom Sneddon's long been on a witch hunt.  I think that the defense would try to show that the investigators in this case are in fact not 
[02:08:30]  objective in their fact-finding process.  What they have is an agenda, and they're looking for something against Michael Jackson,  even in the face of a claim that nothing really existed.  Sergeant Linden, who does most of the questioning, is reportedly the same investigator who wrote  the 1993 affidavit to get court approval to photograph Michael Jackson's private parts  and experience he calls.  A dehumanizing and humiliating examination by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff. 
[02:09:00]  The big question?  Will Jackson's team now try to use Corey's 93 interview in the current case?  Everybody's happy.  Now in his mid-30s, Corey recently starred on The Surreal Life and is now a family man  with a wife and young child.  Corey's reps confirm he has been subvened by authorities to testify in Jackson's current  molestation case.  Reports are Corey may now say there were things in their relationship that were inappropriate 
[02:09:30]  and wrong.  But if the judge allows Corey to take the stand, he may also allow in his 93 interview.  The defense could introduce the tape to impeach Corey Feldman when he said nothing ever happened  and he said that repeatedly.  Reports are Corey will not accuse Jackson of molestation.  One anonymous source says Corey will claim Jackson showed him adult materials, including a Playboy  magazine.  Corey's reps say he's under the gag order and can't comment. 
[02:10:00]  All right, well, Anthony, no wonder why Celebrity Justice is shown in the middle of the night.  CJ, Opie.  It's called CJ.  No surprise that this piece of crap TV show is on at 4 a.m. in New York City.  I know.  I wake up in the middle of the night and there it is.  It's on.  What the hell did they just say?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  And it was all.  You need all the music going. 
[02:10:30]  Corey Feldman.  We caught up with Corey.  That woman.  I can't stand that woman on that show with her affected voice.  What a waste of time.  What is he going to say?  Is her voice affected?  Yeah, just a tad.  I like her.  I didn't even notice her.  Oh, I can't stand her.  Bing, bing, bing.  Corey Feldman isn't going to say, hey, it was me, you lost kid.  What?  Oh, she is the worst. 
[02:11:00]  How many syllables are there in say?  In scum eye.  New interesting twist in the Michael Jackson way on K-I-I-S.  What?  What are you saying?  They distract you with all the zings and zangs that they say nothing.  And then you're like, what did you just say?  I said absolutely nothing. 
[02:11:30]  I'm snorting like Dee Dee now.  And I'm 1993.  Yuck.  Just bear with me for one second, because now I've got to hear her voice.  I'm going to play the whole thing again, obviously.  Oh, it's so affected in Hollywood.  It just has Hollywood.  Let me just hear her again.  Blonde, screwed away into this job voice.  More of our exclusive Corey Feldman police tapes.  Do the 1993 recording suggest cops were on a witch hunt to trap Michael Jackson since his first case? 
[02:12:00]  Dave Willis Mitchell says, the tapes could show the king of pop is the victim of a hidden agenda.  Slaves could show Michael Jackson, the king of pop.  Yeah.  That awful, bimbo, Hollywood voice.  Well, they said absolutely nothing in that piece, Anthony.  I've watched Celebrity Justice a couple of times, hoping to see something.  You know, you're like, all right, this seems like an interesting little show, you know. 
[02:12:30]  There's a little insight on some of the stuff celebrities go through with court and stuff.  Nothing.  Every show is like that.  They get to nothing.  They finish it off.  There's Jerry Seinfeld getting another parking ticket.  Wow.  Oof.  Real Celebrity Justice there.  Yeah.  Here's some...  Jerry Seinfeld in his pure show getting another tia kia.  Yeah.  Smack her in the head.  He could afford those tickets.  He parks wherever the hell he wants.  I'm going to park in the middle of the street. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  He don't care.  I don't care.  They make it sound like he got caught again.  No, he knows what he's doing.  He knows it like he cares.  What a surprise.  I was in a parking space.  He's got at least $100 million in his savings account.  Guess what?  He's parking wherever the hell he wants.  No.  I can't afford it.  I wouldn't worry about it.  You know who can't afford it is the mom from...  Oh, the poor mother from...  Jerry's mom.  Jerry's mom from Seinfeld is what?  Broke?  Bankrupt?  Seinfeld's TV mom files for bankruptcy. 
[02:13:30]  Liz Sheridan is broke.  Jerry's TV mom.  75-year-old.  She's 75.  Veteran entertainer was Jerry's mom, Helen, on Seinfeld from 1990 through 98.  Eight years on, like, the number one show ever.  She was also on ALF.  She was on ALF?  And ALF was a huge hit for, I think, NBC back in the 80s.  In the 80s.  So during the 80s and 90s, this woman had a successful career on two of the most popular  shows ever. 
[02:14:00]  She had two...  Yeah.  And now she's broke.  She's filed for bankruptcy to get creditors off her back and begin anew.  She's a very proud, responsible woman, says somebody.  But she found herself drowning in credit card bills.  The actress owed 15 creditors, ranging from American Express to Victoria's Secret.  Ugh.  More than $90,000.  Secret.  Isn't Jerry a spokesman for Amex?  Yep.  Can he get her off the hook?  Let my mom go! 
[02:14:30]  She's broke!  Sadly, among her personal property as a debtor, she has a list of her working Seinfeld scripts  totaling $1,000, rights to a book.  So I guess, being bankrupt, she's got to sell off a lot of this stuff.  Who gets her Victoria's Secret wear?  Oh, wow.  She has estimated assets at $50,000 and debt close to $100,000.  How are you on Seinfeld for eight years and you have $50,000 in the bank? 
[02:15:00]  I mean, Opie will tell you.  $50,000 is nothing.  Yes.  He'll tell you again and again.  I do believe, Anthony, it's a mere bag of shells.  Oh, a drop in the bucket.  Easy come, easy go.  Easy go.  I spent $1,000 to get the clicking out of the phone.  Clicking out of the phone!  Oh, yeah, wow.  So, yeah, Seinfeld's TV mom broke.  You know those Victoria's Secret panties are awful, too? 
[02:15:30]  The white ones.  Remember, you ever see old window shades?  How they get yellow and, like, that's probably what their awful underwear looks like.  It broke old crow.  Manage your money, buddy.  You're 75 already, for Christ's sake.  She wants to start anew.  Start anew.  Yeah, 75.  Good luck.  All right, well, back to Corey Feldman.  And so, the paper has a lot more info than that stupid celebrity justice show.  Seinfeld's mom broke.  CJ catches up with her. 
[02:16:00]  We caught up with her in Victoria's Secret, buying crotchless panties for her great pants.  What did you do, dumping your pants?  I got so excited doing the sound effects, I just nailed my shin really effing bad.  That'll hurt.  Looked like the turtle poked his head out a little.  Fuck.  We're in the middle of a really funny bit, too.  With the jings and zoos.  You all right? 
[02:16:30]  That would really hurt.  You want your shin rubbed?  No, no, no, no.  All right.  Oh, man, that hurt.  Okay.  Yeah, according to the New York Post, Anthony, former child star Corey Feldman said Michael  Jackson once gave him a crash course in sex ed.  This is what you're going to find out on 2020 when Corey Feldman speaks.  In 2020.  And I'm sure they'll have that reflective shot of Corey just looking into the distance.  Well, now that I think of it, we were looking through Playboy magazines together. 
[02:17:00]  They'll do the VO, as they say in the business, and there will be Corey Feldman just looking  off, reflecting.  Soft piano music, maybe?  Many years ago, he spent time with Michael Jackson.  He tells us now about that.  That horrific day.  When he dressed up like Michael Jackson and danced.  And then had a kaleidoscope-colored cock stuck in his face.  All right, here's the deal. 
[02:17:30]  So, when he was a young teen, Feldman stopped by Jackson's apartment where the King of Pop  showed him a book of pictures of grown men and women naked.  The King of Pop-a-boner.  A picture of grown men and women naked.  The book was about VD.  What?  The book was about venereal diseases and sex.  Oh, so he was teaching the church.  He sat down and he explained it to me.  He showed me some different pictures and discussed what those meant, Feldman said.  I was kind of grossed out by it. 
[02:18:00]  I didn't think of it as a big deal at the time.  This is a pussy pustule from chlamydia.  You can get that from doing this to your tiny little buttock.  What an animal.  Oh, turn the page and here's just the basic syphilis.  This will give you a little sores on your pee-pee.  Let me check yours for sores. 
[02:18:30]  My fingers aren't very sensitive, but my mouth is...  All right.  We're giving you more info than celebrity justice.  Did he put his pee-pee in his mouth?  Feldman, now 33, said it took years for him to conclude Jackson was behaving improperly. 
[02:19:00]  Improperly, sorry, around a teen.  In light of recent evidence, I have to say that if my son was 14 years old and went to a man's apartment  and I knew that they were sitting talking about this, I would probably beat his ass, he said.  Yeah.  Yeah, that'll teach him.  Yeah.  Beat his ass.  Ow, it already hurts, Pop.  Are you about an age 14?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  And then he ends with, Feldman said Jackson never molested him. 
[02:19:30]  Can I help me get this PlayStation in the bag?  It puts the doll in the basket.  If there's this one, it's told.  All right, we'll play it.  You want to hear, are you a size 14?  I love, are you about a size 14?  Because he goes, would you?  Would you?  Would you?  But I know what I really want to hear.  What's our favorite?  Yeah, the other one.  With death and lotion in the basket?  Play him, Paul. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, why not?  What about if I could smell her sea?  Nah, the other ones are better.  Yeah.  Yeah, those two are the hits on that.  Well, let's just, I want to hear, are you a size 14?  Are you about a size 14?  And then we'll, and then we'll, and then we'll go to the hit.  Oh, Pete.  And then we'll do a little Jew Boogie, and then we'll do a little this, and then we'll do  that, and then we'll get out of here for the weekend.  We have to, um, choo!  Superficial people, I don't think looks matter.  Some folks weigh a hundred pounds, but I want someone fatter. 
[02:20:30]  I want a girl who'll fit me to a tee.  A woman who'll look good on me.  Say, say.  Are you about a size 14?  Are you about a size 14?  You better get kicked, because you've got a lion trick, so I put my arm inside a sling.  I've got her in my sights, she's appropriately fat. 
[02:21:00]  I'll wait for her to notice me, I hope she fed her gut.  She's perfect, yes, but the only thing will need you to be seen.  Is she about a size 14?  She'll see me with this couch, and I'll get her in the van.  I'll punch her in the face, and drive away, and that's the plan.  I'll cut off all her skin, and wear it like a dress.  I'll dump her in the ocean, let the cops clean up the mess.  Are you about a size 14?  Are you about a size 14?  If you want to find the one, you need a girl who weighs a ton. 
[02:21:30]  And she's also gotta be naive.  I'll keep her in a well, they'll never ever find her.  I'll tuck my dick between my legs, you'll think it's a vagina.  Yeah, I'll look just like a girl, by golly, I'll have fun.  But for now, be quiet, she can make a sample, sir, she calls me.  Can I give you a high and without?  You look a little handicapped.  She's coming back.  She's coming back.  She's coming back.  I'll ask her to get in.  I'll cut her tag, and if she fits a cut off all your skin. 
[02:22:00]  Are you about a size 14?  Are you about a size 14?  My hobbies include sewing.  If you like me, let's get going.  And I'll put you in a hole where you can scream.  But I'll bet you she's a size 14.  What, what, what, what?  I'm looking for a size 14.  For a what?  She broke this on herself because she offered me her help.  And she's an idiot for trusting me.  Are you about a size 14?  His life was worth the wait. 
[02:22:30]  He's got her in his truck.  She took the bait, and now she's out of luck.  Man, do they do a great job on that.  The music's amazing.  It's a total takeoff on a Broadway show.  Yes, the Kaplan Brothers, Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  I think we have info on this CD on opiananthony.com.  Or foundymusic.com.  But this is our favorite as we go to break.  Put the fucking motion in the basket.  In the basket.  You might hear Drew Boogie freestyle a little bit over this track, okay? 
[02:23:00]  We'll be back.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  Or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same. 
[02:23:30]  It helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them it instead of by their names.  Mr. B, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  Most of you, so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying now, you big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket. 
[02:24:00]  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining, so.  Write down before I jam a bop.  Write down your fucking throat.  Mr. Please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway, but failed. 
[02:24:30]  Precious?  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door. 
[02:25:00]  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell bad girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you if you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you if you lay a fucking Aside. 
[02:25:30]  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you if you lay a fucking peace before I was on that.  Come on!  Don't be hot or ice.  You don't know what pain is.  You don't know what pain is, but I 항 them from saying the trap.  You don't know what pain is.  Learn to play poker with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:26:00]  No.  Oh, God.  You spilled my chip.  I'm sorry, sir.  Opie.  I'll bring you a little...  Now clean it up. 
[02:26:30]  That's right.  Be a poker player, just like your father.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Are you happy now, Opie?  Are you happy?  Sam to Hotel.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  It has to stop.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:27:00]  Drew Boogie in studio today, helping us out.  Spinning and scratching and itching.  See the good stuff.  Doing a real good job.  Joey Paisano, a friend of the show, a personal friend, has a great restaurant in Little Italy.  Paisano's of Mulberry Street.  In the heart of Little Italy, Anthony.  Right.  You go there and say, hey, Opie and Anthony sent me. 
[02:27:30]  I don't care.  He's not advertising anymore.  Just go down there and say, hey, Opie and Anthony sent me and Joey will give you a free  glass of wine, okay?  That's right.  Like the old days, Joey.  Like the old days, right?  And I just found out that Joey's been here since like 6 o'clock.  He wanted to check out the show today and he only gets to check out half the show because  he was being interrogated for the last 40 minutes.  Unbelievable how long that took.  Joey, you're not lying?  40 minutes?  Oh, hold on.  Yeah.  Opie!  Well, no.  We got...  Drew Boogie's got to fade out so then I can turn on Joey's mic. 
[02:28:00]  This is so stupid, but that's how it works today.  All right.  Now we got Joey.  40 minutes to get through security?  Yeah.  I didn't know it was like an airport.  You didn't tell me to come two hours before the show to get in.  Please show up.  Yeah.  Check with your local carriers.  Mr. Paisano, I'm sorry to ask you this, but you're going to have to bend over, spread  your cheeks.  Yeah.  Why?  Does Master Poe realize that Joey's a friend of ours?  I'm not sure.  Did you have to show ID?  I had to show ID, take pictures. 
[02:28:30]  Take pictures.  I don't understand the picture thing.  Stand up, sit down.  How many things to sign?  How much to sign?  You know, I actually didn't...  I don't think I signed anything, but...  40 minutes to just take pictures?  Come on.  What happens?  Because now we got a friend that went through the process.  So you show up like, hey, I'm here to see Opie and Anthony.  I'm here to see Opie and Anthony.  What happens?  It's like, why?  It's like, well, because they asked me to stop up.  Who asked you to stop up?  I'm like, Opie.  So there's a whole, like, interrogation.  Whole interrogation. 
[02:29:00]  You know, all those karate moves that he does is cute and all, but does he realize what  a gun can do?  Oh, boy.  What an idiot.  Uh-oh.  So, and then what?  And then he takes your picture?  Then he takes my picture, takes your ID.  What is the picture for?  What, to know where I live, where I work, what I do.  All my phone numbers, email addresses, how old is my mom?  It was kind of a little weird.  He asked your email address?  He said, for what?  Why are these questions being asked? 
[02:29:30]  I want to know why.  Are you on a mailing list for XM?  There's no reason to have email addresses.  Why?  It's a little weird because he usually spends that much time with the really hot chicks.  Not with the dudes and not with the fat chicks.  The fat chick could walk right in here and get on the air within 30 seconds.  Yeah, with a machete.  If you're a hot chick, then you have to spend a long time in Master Poe's little booth as  he takes your picture and tries to see if he could, you know, bang you.  I don't think people need to put through this.  Ben, what's going on with this? 
[02:30:00]  Seriously.  What is this?  Does Poe know that Joey's a really good friend of ours?  For one of our meetings in Washington, everyone has to go through this process.  It takes a long time.  What?  Why?  Whose idea?  Talk to the lawyers.  Why do they want?  It doesn't matter if it's Opie's brother, if it's your brother.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  My brother will not be going through that.  Trust me.  He might pay a hundred bucks when he goes out, but he's not going to be photographed.  My brother will not be going through that. 
[02:30:30]  Anthony's brother will not be going through that.  Well, they've actually already been here.  Our friends will not be going through that.  Only the first time they have to do it?  Well, he's been here before, but they, since we went, since one of our last trips to Washington,  all the paperwork had changed.  No, our friends and family are not going to be treated like criminals, okay?  Neither should guess.  How about this?  You sign something and you're in.  That's it.  Because once again, it's a false sense of security.  A bunch of lawyers who have nothing else to do, get together, they put their greedy,  stupid faces together, and this is what they come up with. 
[02:31:00]  Forty minutes of bullshit.  I don't understand why we need to take pictures of the guests that come up here.  Poe can explain it, because he knows why.  Can we see what I meant to explain?  Yes.  Maybe they just told him that's what he has to do.  Mr. Poe, you've insulted my friend Joey here.  Do you know that?  I'm not even kidding.  Joey has been disrespected.  Joey, I know he's your friend.  Pull down your pants.  What are you doing?  Ooh, I like that ultra right there.  That's the attitude.  Why are they pulled up so high? 
[02:31:30]  I'm wearing them.  Unfortunately, the new process is to take care of all paperwork.  Everyone that comes in, I can't do it.  He said it took 40 minutes.  Well, what happens, something happened with my computer.  I had to reboot a couple of times.  What kind of paperwork is it?  What do they actually do?  It's just basic paperwork.  You have two forms, the kind that we had ever since we started.  Unfortunately, Joe came here for the first time a long time ago, and we had a hard copy. 
[02:32:00]  So this is a computerized copy.  The next time he comes in, it's only going to take him maybe five minutes.  It shouldn't even take that.  It should take one minute.  Hey, how are you?  It's Joey.  Why next time is there anything?  What is there next time?  Every time someone arrives, they have to do the paperwork.  They have to sign the paperwork.  This is the new protocol as per conversation that we had three weeks ago.  Oh, I'm not saying you came up with it.  I'm saying it's ridiculous.  Whose idea was it?  What lawyer in Washington has to have somebody... 
[02:32:30]  Like, did Flavor Flav have to fill anything out before he went on the air?  Well, Flavor Flav, unfortunately, was rushed in here, and I have to get all the information from his publicist.  But the lawyers, the lawyers would have actually had him go into that office at quarter to ten and fill out fucking paperwork.  This is a stupid radio show.  This is a NASA.  What about the pictures?  Why are people's pictures being taken?  Pictures?  You need a picture ID.  Yeah, but why are people's pictures being taken? 
[02:33:00]  Because the picture will go on their paperwork.  See?  So any time that you look at the paperwork, you actually have a picture that goes with the paperwork.  Eventually, there's going to be so much red tape and paperwork that we're not even going to be able to do a show anymore.  How about a retina scan?  Washington lawyers, how about a nice retina scan when you walk in?  What's the reason for all this?  Um, besides, uh, their picture, you also have their license.  I know, you disrespected Joe a little bit. 
[02:33:30]  A little bit, a little bit, a little bit.  A little bit.  Joe, no disrespect intended.  I knew you were a friend, but it had to be done.  That's all right, Paul.  You did okay.  It's all right.  It's not.  Now get your fucking shine box.  Wait, they, there's a picture and his license?  That's good, Anthony.  It's like a double ID thing?  His picture has to be taken and the license is photocopy?  Did you yell at me, Anthony?  What's that?  Photocop, wait.  His license and his photo.  I don't understand why there has to be eight, how many photos of Joey do we need? 
[02:34:00]  How many pictures are on there?  Six M's.  No, I think you're hot, but I mean, it's just, I only need one.  It's like the license.  That's all you need.  Paul's giving out wallet-sized portraits.  Yeah, hey, wait, could you smile by the flag and tilt your head?  This is not a wedding.  I know, I know Joey's wanted for something, but let's all calm down here.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, he's not used to taking one from the front without another from the side.  All right.  And can you put a ruler behind him? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, you did good.  You filled out your paperwork like a man.  You didn't give anybody up.  Here is your photo ID, which is nice and clear, and I take the picture myself personally.  This is your ID from your New York driver's license, and sometimes the picture is not that clear.  Right.  So I need to have both of them.  So the license is clear enough for a cop to pull you over, but not clear enough for the lawyers in Washington.  Right, for this.  A cop physically takes it out and looks at it, whereas this goes through a computer and then goes through a printer. 
[02:35:00]  Do you know you're a computer?  That's what they use when they photograph from the air when we're in a war.  They will photograph from the air, and they filter it through a computer, so it's good enough for that, but you can't get a license into a computer, so the fucking XM lawyers are happy.  Right.  How about this?  Get us a better photocopier.  There's less security at the airports.  Is the picture...  Is Joey flying anywhere that we don't know about?  Did you confiscate scissors from him out of a duffel bag when he walked in?  The picture that you take besides the license picture, because the license picture doesn't come out clear enough, right? 
[02:35:30]  Correct.  Clear enough for what?  That we might mistake someone else for Joey as we're looking at license pictures on Xerox?  Can I see it?  Nope.  That's Joey.  Why would we ever look at those pictures?  I know.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  The photos, they go into one folder in my computer, in my hard drive, and then the ID, the IDs go into another folder.  What the hell is going on?  I don't understand.  Because they have nothing else to do in Washington, Anthony. 
[02:36:00]  That's why.  I'm not going to give away the answers.  Let's just say birth name, title, maiden name, legal name, also known as...  They have an AKA on this list.  Mailing address, city-state zip, picture ID number one, picture ID number two,  driver's license number.  Who gives a shit what his driver's license number is?  Date of birth and age, because you can't have one. 
[02:36:30]  You have to have both.  Social security.  Why do we need a social security number?  It's none of our fucking business.  There is no reason whatsoever to put a social security number.  Alias, if any.  Alias, if any.  Joey Salmonella Paisano.  Time in, time out.  Witness.  Witness.  And it actually says Master Poe as the witness.  I'm the one who witnessed him fucking... 
[02:37:00]  You need a witness for the...  That is ridiculous.  Website.  Website.  Website.  Home phone number.  Work phone number.  Mobile number.  Expiration date.  And please sign.  This is fucking ludicrous.  Website.  Eatabullet.com.  What are you supposed to do?  Gives a shit.  Stress factory tonight.  Why don't you just put down for phone number 888-541-HA-HA. 
[02:37:30]  That is revolting.  Why is a social security number, which is your key to your life here in the United States of America,  why is that needed here?  Could someone from Washington call us and explain this?  Because this is really weird.  Get Elo on the phone immediately.  He actually called me back yesterday, and I forgot to call him back.  Did he?  I just missed each other.  Oops.  If they call and they tell me to take out all this, I will.  However, when I first started, we had how many pages? 
[02:38:00]  Nine?  I understand.  Nine pages.  I consolidated nine into two.  You're just brilliant.  Nine into two.  Well, it's just that it takes so long.  No, no, wait, wait, wait, no.  Because then if I had nine, that means you would have, Joey, we would have been out there  for two hours.  But no, we were out there for only 40 minutes because my computer kept on going.  Look at that stack of papers.  It's big as your fucking head.  I understand you're doing your job, but you got to call Washington and say the guys just  don't get this.  And maybe you could get an explanation and Monday or Tuesday you could come in and explain 
[02:38:30]  it to us.  We need an explanation because it's ridiculous.  You're still here.  I thought I told you to go fill out your paperwork.  Bang, boom.  The information that's on this paperwork was also on the other paperwork.  And I knew Joey was a friend.  I knew Joey was a friend.  Did you send him through the metal detector?  No, no.  I took care of him.  I let him sit down.  I let him relax and listen to the show.  No, he didn't go through the metal detector?  No.  Good move.  Wow.  The social security number thing is weird. 
[02:39:00]  That's only needed if you're looking up people's finances.  I checked to see if there was any bulges on the side.  No, there wasn't.  Can I ask why there's one line for alias and one line for also known as?  What is the difference between also known as and alias?  That's the same thing.  The redundancy of the legal system comes out in little moments like that.  You know what is really amazing?  Our guests, people that come in here, have to fill that out.  I work for XM.  I didn't fill out anything nearly as in-depth as that is to come in here. 
[02:39:30]  They pay me.  I come in here every day.  They don't know any aliases I have.  They don't know.  Cell phone numbers.  They don't know.  I didn't fill out a form like that to work here.  Yeah.  I never saw any paperwork that said, Benny the Bulge sparked.  It's just another false sense of security is all it is.  Master Poe, do you understand how many guns are in this building right now? 
[02:40:00]  Do you want to guess?  How many guns?  How many guns in the building?  We'll find out later on CJ.  Many people come to radio stations armed and dangerous.  But we'll talk with Master Poe on CJ, oh boy.  Let's just put it this way. 
[02:40:30]  There's more than one.  That's good.  That means we're safe.  There's more than one in this building right now, okay?  That's wonderful.  A little bit.  I would put the number at about three today.  Okay.  All right.  Now, Keith just walks in.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  Well, he's a police officer.  Keith is a police officer.  Keith is a friend of yours.  I've got to say, when Joey handed me his gun, it kind of turned me on.  You ever make Karen fill out paperwork again, and I'll kill you. 
[02:41:00]  Master Poe is making people fill out paperwork up there.  I want everyone to know.  Master Poe makes people fill out paperwork up there.  Oh, Carrion.  Carrion.  I should be carrying AIDS and drinking it.  No improv skills, fat kid and zilch. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, Randy from New York City, listen to this one.  Randy, go ahead, buddy.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, when Barry Williams shows up, does he have to put his alias down as Johnny Bravo?  Yo, later, punch it out.  Might have to do that.  Let me tell you something, too.  Randy had a perfect phone call for the show today.  Yeah.  Got his thing done, and he's out.  Bam.  Perfect example of what we want from you guys.  George, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Morning.  Hello, my Jelly Roll baby.  Hi, how are you?  I got on a plane yesterday in 20 minutes. 
[02:42:00]  What?  Yeah, he got on a plane in 20 minutes.  Yeah.  From curb to plane, 20 minutes.  I got from curb to plane in 20 minutes.  I went through security, had two carry-on bags.  They took my shoes off.  I got on the plane and went home.  You guys are awful.  I'm punching out.  Bye, fella.  All right.  And one more from Kansas.  Nick, go ahead.  Hey, what the fuck is being done with all that information that Master Poe has taken?  And who sees it?  Who has access to it?  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  Jesus Christ.  That's it.  Your whole fucking life is right there on that fucking piece of paper.  You know something?  Talk about identity theft.  Everything that is on that paper is more than all you need to steal someone's identity, credit card fraud,  and just completely screw up someone's financial life for years and years to come based on just what is there.  There's everything you need there.  Yeah.  There's pictures.  There's license, social security, aliases, names, phone numbers, addresses, everything you need. 
[02:43:00]  I cannot believe it.  Master Poe, just find out what they're doing with all this.  I'm not even kidding.  It's just ridiculous.  Maiden name.  Is there any?  I can see name, phone number, do you consent to be on the radio, and license.  That's what you use as a security code when you call your bank.  Things like that.  Mother's maiden name.  Things like that.  It's absolutely ridiculous. 
[02:43:30]  Unbelievable that that is even asked for and that people give it.  Especially when you have a license.  If they don't like the way the license is, how about a better scanner?  How about that?  Instead of wasting time taking a picture, there's two photos of him at the top.  I don't know if this is true, but I've got to go to Jim in Oklahoma.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  No, no, that's fine.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, I go in and out of nuclear power plants with a truck, and I get in there in about five minutes.  Five minutes when he's delivering to nuclear power plants. 
[02:44:00]  He is in the facility with a truck in five minutes.  But people have to spend up to 40 minutes to get on this dopey radio show.  Well, if you had to go through this security, you'd never make it, because when you accidentally  listed your website as I have a bomb in the trunk dot com, they would stop you.  All right, let's say hi to Larry on Long Island.  Larry, what's up?  Oh, and hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Big Nuts Norton, what's your story?  Larry, you're going to find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry. 
[02:44:30]  Hey, son, I got a question for Joey from Paisanos.  Yeah.  Do you really think that three onions is necessary for the sauce?  You don't need three onions.  All right, well, that's great.  Oh, my God.  Put in your sugar or a little wine.  Some sausage.  You know what?  One other thing we just got to mention here, this whole false sense of security, because 
[02:45:00]  I don't know, they got bulletproof glass and Kevlar.  Oh, it's crazy.  Same nuts.  We have an assigned assassin that's kind of like our protector, but Anthony and I walk  here at a certain time with the dregs of society on the sidewalk.  Yeah, I know.  I'm tripping over homeless people.  Black Escalade's just driving up and down 57th Street.  You never know what's going to pop out of that at any given time. 
[02:45:30]  But thank God through 15 locked doors, I'm safe.  Once I get through the 15 locked doors alone, but then I'm in here, I'm safe.  You got delivery trucks parked right in front of the building with suspicious characters.  Yeah, who cares, right?  Guys in cabs that have never picked up a passenger.  Oh.  But we're safe out there, Anthony, as we come to work.  I was walking today.  Hey, I see two dogs.  One's looking one way, one's looking the other. 
[02:46:00]  I saw Anthony today.  It's pitch dark out there, and it goes, hey, and I jump like 10 feet.  I go, hey, oh, ah!  But as soon as we get in the building, we're nice and secure, Anthony.  Yeah.  That's great.  Unbelievable.  All right, well, Valentine's Day is Monday.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you read this as the celebrity justice girl?  And I'll do the...  If anyone wants to join in, they're more than welcome. 
[02:46:30]  Um, CJ, Valentine's Day is Monday.  The last thing you want to do is spend the weekend in a mall, right?  I got three words for you.  View me on to your Yeti, Pierre.  Call one of their beer counselors at 1-800-829-B-E-A-R.  1-800-829-B-E-A-R.  And they'll help you choose the perfect beer.  They'll deliver it right on Valentine's Day.  With free chocolate and a gift card in their famous box. 
[02:47:00]  Even better, send a beer to her at the office.  When it arrives, she'll be completely surprised.  And her co-workers will think you're the greatest guy.  It's a sure thing.  Ask about the love bandit.  The lover boy bear with the tattoo and the Romeo bear.  Or the gangster of love.  Vermont Teddy Bear, the only bear handmade in America and guaranteed for life.  Best of all, she'll think of you every time she hugs her little bear.  So make this Valentine's Day special with a gift she'll really love. 
[02:47:30]  And always remember, 1-800-829-B-E-A-R.  Or shop online at vermontteddybear.com.  Do whatever.  Yeah, send the creative alternative to flowers.  Valentine's Day delivery is guaranteed.  1-800-829-B-E-A-R.  Tell them all the way in the way.  All right.  Unbelievable.  A little tease here.  When we come back, a brand new Diva promo from our team.  There was the coffee Diva. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  There was the bagel Diva.  Yep.  There was the potato Diva.  On the way, after the break.  Yeah.  Milk Diva.  And tomorrow we'll have sandwiches.  But first, Drew Boogie will take us a break.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  All right, New Jersey. 
[02:48:30]  Fasten your seatbelts and put on your laughing hats.  I'll be performing at the new Stress Factory on Route 35, February 11 and 12 only.  Only.  The box office is 888-541-HA-HA.  That's 888-541-HA. 
[02:49:00]  This Friday, Saturday, Eatontown, New Jersey.  Put on your laughing hats.  Laughing hats.  Laughing hats.  Laughing hats.  Laughing hats.  Wonderful.  Fantastic.  Son of a bitch.  Goddamn plug-in.  Son of a bitch.  1-2-3-4. 
[02:49:30]  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  Look at me freestyling with Drew, Anthony.  Come on.  1-2-3-4.  Oh, ah.  Oh, ah.  Oh, ah. 
[02:50:00]  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  1-2-3-4.  Welcome to the OP and...  Hello?  Hi, Ma.  Ma, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Welcome to the OP...  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back. 
[02:50:30]  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the OP and Anthony Show.  Oof.  Finally.  XM-202.  The OP and Anthony Show.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Terrific.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Terrific.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  OK.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  OK.  Terrific.  OK.  OK.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  OK, TERRIFIC.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, we're terrific. 
[02:51:30]  Okay, terrific.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program.  Drew Boogie spinning in studio today.  Okay.  Definitely a cool feel today.  No ant.  Hell yeah.  Martini Steve in studio.  A lot of people on instant feedback asking for ATM and pin numbers for the show.  Oh, Vanilla Thunder from Philly says, I'm a retired investor on a pension, and I wish 
[02:52:00]  to get in to see O.N.A. in the twilight of my life.  All right, we'll take one more phone call about that.  I think it's Army, the trucker.  Army, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning there, sweet cheeks.  Hi, Army.  Thanks for calling the program.  Why, thank you.  So I was just going to make a comparison that it sounded like you're ready to get on O.N.A.'s  show.  It's kind of like trying to get on Get Smart. 
[02:52:30]  It's going to go through all the doors.  We get into the phone booth and it drops us down.  I'll talk to you later.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  And then you walk through 15 different doors.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  It is.  It's like Get Smart.  But we have some kind of protective shield around us when we're walking the streets to get here.  The Cone of Silence.  We've got the Cone of Silence as we walk the block or two to the actual broadcast center.  Priorities.  That's brilliant.  Stunning here.  More stunning. 
[02:53:00]  Absolutely brilliant.  All right.  We've got Martini Steve in studio.  It's Martini Steve.  Mm-hmm.  Steve?  Yeah.  We talked about Ramone last week.  Yes, we did.  Your imaginary friend.  Mm-hmm.  Ramone.  We just noticed something else about your production.  What about it?  It seems like you have a mommy issue.  Oh, that one promo?  Yeah.  Oh, that was a one-time incident where I was actually at NEW cutting some other piece of 
[02:53:30]  production and the phone kept ringing and it was her asking me all these questions.  And when you're trying to do anything around a mic and trying to get something done and  a phone keeps ringing, it is the most irritating goddamn thing ever.  But I noticed this one doesn't make much sense.  Yeah, it's not accurate.  What?  A little odd.  A little odd.  Well, let's give it a listen.  Yeah, let's listen to this again.  We'll point out where it's at.  Odd.  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Hi, Ma. 
[02:54:00]  Ma, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Welcome to the Opie...  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Finally.  All right, you see, it sounds like you're beating up your mom at the end of the promo.  No, it's like I'm beating up a phone.  We thought it might be you beating up the mom.  No, no, no, no.  It had a fleshy sound to the punch. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I know.  I was trying to mask it, but it was supposed to be throwing a phone around, but the only  impact-y sounds I had at the time were punch hits, so I had to...  Yeah, because it comes off like you're punching your mom who was on the phone, and why would  she be there if she's calling?  But how logistically could I punch my mom if she was calling on the phone?  That's why it sounded weird like that.  Well, here's my question, too.  If that's the case, you're throwing the phone around, why is it still ringing clearly while  you're punching it?  Oh, there you go.  Phones don't ring clearly when they're knocked off the hook.  You're absolutely right, and it's something I should revisit.  If I could figure out the sound a phone makes as it's sort of half-ringing, half-being thrown 
[02:55:00]  in the air and bashed about...  Why isn't Ramon taking the call?  Ah, Ramon didn't exist at that point.  No.  And also, the phones these days don't ring like that.  Yeah, that phone in the old studio actually did ring like that.  Was it an old-style phone?  It was.  It was one of those old phones with an old ringer, so I could hear it while I had cans  on.  That was...  All right.  And that was the reason I used that ring.  Thank you for clearing that up, Steve.  You're welcome.  It was bothering me.  Yeah, we love to go behind the scenes of your production. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's very fascinating.  It's like a DVD.  You get it, but you also get the extras here with Steve.  We invite him in to do a little commentary on his...  Scene-by-scene commentary.  Actually, do we have it again?  Oh, gee.  Play it, and Steve, comment over it.  Yeah, let's do that.  Like a DVD commentary.  If Derek can play it a little lower.  Let us know what was happening, what was going on, maybe a little technical thing.  Just like a DVD.  And if you need Derek to stop, just raise your hand or something.  All right, here we go.  Once again, it's Steve's promo with his mom harassing him. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, music starts.  Welcome to the OP and...  Hello.  Hi, Mom.  Pick up the phone.  You're all right.  Say hi to your mom.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Hold on.  You're welcome.  All right, so the first call comes in.  First call comes in.  You're not that irritated because, you know, it's your mom.  Maybe you haven't talked to her in a while.  You know, you've got to take a call from your mom.  You know, all right.  She breaks in.  She cuts into a recording session.  It happens.  It's not that big of a deal.  Can I go back to the menu?  Exactly.  I think I really just want to watch the feature, now that I think of it. 
[02:56:30]  I hope there's not a stupid Easter egg in this one.  Oh, there's plenty.  I want to hear it in another language.  Too bad Henri can't help us.  Now, I want to know a little bit about that sound.  How is that?  It's the intro to the actual song that's being used in the promo.  Oh, it is.  See, that's the tidbits I get the extras for.  Because we're revving up for the OP and Anthony show?  You're revving up.  It's actually the beginning of a Jeff Beck song.  Oh, see?  No, I didn't know this.  And now that you're listening to the behind-the-scenes DVD portion of the promo, 
[02:57:00]  now we know that that is actually a song.  What Jeff Beck song?  It is called...  I don't remember.  It's called...  I like that.  This is like a little documentary at the end of the DVD.  Yeah.  Maybe the making of...  The extras that you get at the end of the DVD.  Yes.  The making of woman-beating promo number 528.  I have not made a misogynistic promo in months.  All right.  So...  Have you now?  All right.  Let's go back.  Get to the rest of it now.  Steve, comment.  Hello. 
[02:57:30]  Hi, Mom.  Mom working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Perfect.  Who's doing the mom voice?  That was...  That was me.  Just, you know...  You are doing all the voices on this.  Even the mom.  And did you muffle your voice?  Had to.  Had to muffle it in the hands and do like a high pitch and pitch it up afterwards.  Because my voice is not that.  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  You go like...  Wow, we're getting some live...  Exactly.  Steve doing the voice.  Exactly.  So you EQ it and filter it.  That's kind of cool.  Like the Family Guy DVD behind the scenes. 
[02:58:00]  You get to see the real people doing the voices.  And you see the sketches of the cartoon characters.  They're not in cartoon, you know...  Yeah.  You get to see real life.  That's what it is.  We're seeing Steve actually do it.  Very interesting.  Exactly.  So, you know, again, you start up with the revving music and it gets right back into it.  Did you have the inspiration for the mom?  The inspiration for the mom was...  Yeah, maybe the teacher from Peanuts or something.  Yeah, it was along those lines because you try to think of an off-camera voice.  Yeah, okay.  Now I understand what you're meaning.  Yeah, you think of an off-camera voice that's going to be easily identifiable as something  squawking in the background. 
[02:58:30]  All right.  Like, you know...  And now it looks like you're getting more madder at your mom here.  Uh, yeah.  Why did I buy this box set?  Oh, Jesus.  This one sucks.  This is...  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How bad did you want to call her the C word there?  Oh, you don't do that.  Never. 
[02:59:00]  No.  Never.  You can smash phones, but you don't use that word against your mom.  Yeah.  You never do that.  Not in a promo.  You think of any other alternative.  Yes, Jim.  So you beat this amazing phone that comes off the hook when you answer it, but yet when  you beat it, it stays on the hook and reigns.  Remarkably enough, the phone stayed...  The phone kept ringing just to emphasize the irritation factor.  Because how else?  You know, what other phone...  Unless I actually wanted to destroy a phone, which I really didn't feel like paying for  at that point.  Do you get the point across that you're destroying a phone other than, you know, manipulating  the audio of a phone ringing?  Yeah.  You make a thud sound, and then the ring stops abruptly. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, but then it just sounds like you're beating, you know, wood or, not wood, plastic.  You're beating a phone.  That's what phones are made of.  Plastic.  Yeah, but how do you replicate that without actually destroying a phone is my point.  Opinions expressed in this commentary are not necessarily those of the Opie and Anthony  show.  No phones were injured in the making of this documentary.  Sorry.  Exactly.  So I didn't actually destroy a phone.  I had to fabricate the destruction of a phone.  Wow.  And that's where the punch sound effects, you know, often you use...  Was there green screen photography used and CGI special effects? 
[03:00:00]  We were thinking of going that route, but it was a little too costly, so we had to, you  know, go a little, you know...  Just go with...  Yeah.  Andy, is this possible?  Well, it looks like Steve's mom is calling the program.  Oh!  Danny, yeah, thank you.  Let's go to Steve's mom.  Steve's mom!  Yes, this is Stephen's mother.  Yeah, right.  Stephen?  Yes, mom.  Will you play along, Steve?  You know, you're a good boy, and I did not raise you to be like this. 
[03:00:30]  You have a lot of aggression, you know, with beating up on the phone and beating up on Ramon,  and, you know, Dr. Phil says, you know, when you take something away, you should replace  it with something, and I was just thinking, you know, there's a funny man named Jim Norton,  and he's going to be playing at a comedy club up there in New Jersey, and I just thought  that maybe you could replace some of this aggression with going to see Jim Norton.  That's a fine idea.  Where's Jim playing? 
[03:01:00]  He's going to be at the Stress Factory, which is located inside the Sheraton in Eatontown,  New Jersey, tonight and tomorrow night.  Hey, Ms. C., do you have the phone number handy?  I didn't think so.  Log on to www.eatabullet.com.  You can find out information that way, sweetie.  Thank you, Steve's mom.  Thanks a lot, Ms. C.  888-541-HA-HA-HA.  Stupid bitch, have the plug ready next time you call. 
[03:01:30]  Thanks, Mom.  Jim didn't mean it.  Anthony, speaking of Steve's production.  Well, that was great, and the insight that he gave us behind the scenes there.  I almost felt like I was there as he was making it.  Sure, definitely.  Fascinating.  Yeah.  Speaking of his production, he's got a new D.Va promo for us.  New D.Va?  We love the D.Va promo.  Wow, we've all gotten nailed with a D.Va promo.  Who's a...  I noticed, who was Coffee D.Va?  That was Norton.  I was Coffee D.Va.  Who was Bagel D.Va? 
[03:02:00]  I was Bagel D.Va.  Okay, I was Potato D.Va.  Potato.  And now I'm going to be Milk D.Va, too.  Ah, true.  Absolutely.  I remember your tirade on the milk.  Sure.  And Steve came up with this.  Steve S.O.S.  I need milk immediately.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show, Milk D.Va.  Milk D.Va.  World Tour.  World Tour.  Featuring all your favorite Milk D.Va hits.  Live.  Live.  In concert.  My blood sugar level is dropping as I speak. 
[03:02:30]  Featuring the classic, There's a Deli Downstairs.  There's a deli right downstairs, is there not?  Oh, the app gets milk from Dwayne Reed.  You could forget the number one smash hit.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  A special guest, the Milk D.Va.  I walk in the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  And for the first time in over a decade, you don't bring me milk anymore.  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around. 
[03:03:00]  So I'm like, uh, I will pass out.  You sound like a madman.  I know I'm whining.  The Milk D.Va.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie wants milk.  He only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing how desperate I am right now?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  That was great.  Now, the music was a little loud at the beginning of that. 
[03:03:30]  Was it?  Yeah, I'm going to have to do that differently.  You're going to have to remix that a little bit.  Yeah, I can do that.  But very funny, very accurate.  He was a lunatic that day.  Yeah, that, you know, when he goes into those tirades, I just, you know, it spawns inspiration.  Yes.  And you have to, I don't know if I can beat that one, but I can try.  You know what sucks?  You know, we have that one.  And now I know, like a month later, I'm going to have to get it again with all the extras.  You know?  Because that's what they do.  They pump out a promo.  You hear it.  You get used to it. 
[03:04:00]  And you have it.  And then they put out the one where Steve tells how he did it.  And I wind up having to get two of them.  It's a two-month anniversary edition.  Yeah.  The platinum edition.  All of them.  I love it.  Director's cut.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they do.  Director's cut.  Maybe some added things that were cut out in the mix.  30 minutes of footage that sucked.  So you didn't, you know, and that's why they left it out of the original.  Oh, the version where the music's so loud, you miss the whole beginning of it.  Yeah.  I hate those.  I think we just heard that one.  I'd love to be a fly on the wall in his studio, or more accurately, a worm in the bottle. 
[03:04:30]  No, they just picked up.  Oh, Lady Di stepping all over your snowmage.  Of course you do it.  Of course you're used to it.  Fat hoops.  Because we're on the air.  No, we're not.  Yes, we are.  So, yeah, we're going to be going down to Jersey.  Hopefully, we'll be coming this weekend.  And it'll be good to, you know, have you guys come down.  They're coming all over my house.  Tomorrow.  Hey, stop.  Thank God Lady Di and Marion are not on the show anymore.  I got Marion on the other line, too.  Just put them on.  Make sure they're on hold if they're going to call.  They're talking about it, I think. 
[03:05:00]  They know they're...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Opie.  They're calling in right now?  Yes.  I'm right here.  Danny, don't put them on the air, all right?  Yeah, keep them on hold.  Keep them on hold.  I'm right here.  All right, we've got to see if we can get this assault on the media done.  Yeah, we're still waiting to see if that's going to happen.  And all the morning shows are in Central Park for the gates by the artist Christo.  They told...  We want some of our signs to be held up front of the cameras.  Diane, they told Danny, don't put you on the radio.  We're on the radio.  Diane, we're not on the radio.  We're on the radio.  No, we're not.  Yes, we are.  We're not.  Yes, we are.  No, we're not.  Hey, Opie. 
[03:05:30]  Hey, guys.  Now they're playing the silent game.  You're going over to see the gates in Central Park?  They're not...  We're not on the radio.  Yes, they are on the radio.  And you're on the radio, too.  We are not.  Yes, we are.  We are not.  What are you, nuts?  Yes, we are on the radio.  Are you drinking this morning or what?  Marion!  What?  We're on the radio.  Yeah, on the radio.  We're not.  Yes, we are.  Yeah, right.  I have the three-way calling.  We're on the radio.  That doesn't mean that we're on the radio because you've got a three-way call. 
[03:06:00]  We are on the radio.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  I wanted to let you know something.  But I guess you're not listening to us because you're playing the silent game.  Okay?  We'll talk to you later.  We are on the radio.  I know we're...  I know we are.  But you are...  Is it possible for you to shut the fuck up for ten seconds?  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole. 
[03:06:30]  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  You're all right to take me...  Shut up!  Will you?  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut, shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  Shut up! You shut up! You shut up! You shut up! You shut up! Shut up!  Shut the fuck up! You shut up! Shut up! 
[03:07:00]  Now describe to me what Marcellus Wossilus looks like.  Marcellus Wossilus.  You're a Marcellus Wossilus.  All right, well, Anthony.  God damn, are they annoying as hell.  You just spent 20 minutes arguing if they're on the radio or not.  They're on the radio, no we're not. Yes we are, no we're not. Yes we are, no we're not. 
[03:07:30]  Yes we are, no we're not. Shut up!  Anthony, in the office before the show today, you were talking about this Golden Gate Bridge thing.  A documentary?  Yes. Is this really true?  Yeah, yeah. Some guy is, the Golden Gate Bridge authority, I guess, is all pissed off  in trying to keep this documentary filmmaker from making a film  because they say he based his filming on a lie. 
[03:08:00]  He said he wanted to film the Golden Gate Bridge time-lapse, set up cameras, and just let him run for quite a while, for like a few months, so he could show the bridge in the changing seasons.  Sounds nice, doesn't it?  Sure.  Sounds like a real boring-ass documentary, doesn't it?  With the fog coming down.  Yeah, because they get the fog that lays in there, the changing vegetation.  Maybe some different shadows, the sun going down, maybe a cloudy day.  The tides, things like that.  The fast motion traffic going over the bridge with the lights and everything like that. 
[03:08:30]  So they set up these cameras, and that's what he said, which would have made a really dull documentary.  Imagine sitting through that crap.  But the guy had a different idea.  What he caught in the time that he had the cameras rolling was about 19 people jumping to their deaths.  In how long a period of time?  Off the bridge.  It wasn't very long.  It was a few months.  Wow.  People jump off the bridge all the time.  I guess he knew about this.  Figured he'd focus the cameras on there and do a documentary.  What he was really doing is a documentary about people killing themselves on the bridge. 
[03:09:00]  And he would film these people, find out who they were, and then go to their families, friends, and talk about why the person killed themselves and stuff.  And there you have the culmination of the story is the guy killing himself.  Yeah, there's a major problem with that bridge.  I was reading something about it.  I mean, it's like, I don't know, two a month or something like that, killing themselves.  And they're afraid that, the bridge authority is afraid that by showing something like this, it's just going to draw a lot more people to the bridge to kill themselves. 
[03:09:30]  Which, you know, it's kind of one of those ways, often yourself, where you're kind of not affecting any innocent bystanders, which is cool.  Yeah, no one cares.  The police who are trained in that have to fish you out of the water.  But you're not landing on a sidewalk in front of somebody or a train conductor.  You're not inconveniencing traffic.  You're not, you know, blowing your head off and leaving yourself there for someone to find by surprise.  Greedy, selfish suicide people.  So, they're a little upset with that.  But, man, that sounds like a documentary I would go see. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  Watch people jump off the bridge.  But, yeah, clever guy.  All right, let's say hi to Dwayne.  Hey, Dwayne, what's up?  What's up?  What are you doing, Dwayne?  Dwayne.  I'm a true driver.  I'm out here on Long Island.  Hi, hi, hi.  What up, Dwayne?  Oh, what's up?  Slappin' in.  I, uh, I'm a new listener to the show.  I love it, though, man, the way I always mess with people and stuff.  So, but, uh, the thing I wanted to say. 
[03:10:30]  Drew, you speak black?  Help us out here.  No, I'm sorry.  Yes, sir.  Start over.  Oh.  No, the thing I wanted to say, I was listening to the show the other night.  We all were talking about down there, Monograw, watching the black kids, you know, some of  the little local hoods mess with people.  Right.  I grew up in Mississippi, man, and, uh, and you know what I did, man?  Um, I always, you know, I experienced racism a lot as a kid, but there were times, man, where 
[03:11:00]  I see people doing stuff like that.  You know, it gives, it makes the black people who are out here trying to do something for  themselves, it just pisses you off.  And well it should.  And well it should.  Did you have friends that do that, sir?  Yeah, I do.  What did you tell, what did you say to them?  I don't, man, I want y'all to just quit.  God damn it, stop.  Sometimes when you see them do stuff like this, you definitely want to take a shotgun and just 
[03:11:30]  blow them all the way, man.  You know, I hate to feel like this, because no one remembers the black people who are  trying to do something, they always remember the ones who are always screwing up.  Remember the bad stuff, exactly.  And, uh.  And I'm sorry to hear, uh, Dwayne, that you were, uh, kicked out of Panzerfaust.  No.  No?  No.  Well, I thought that's what he was calling for.  I'm sorry, Dwayne.  I was in Mexicans.  I, I, I messed up who you are.  Well, you can play a Panzerfaust soccer, Dwayne, if you really want to. 
[03:12:00]  No.  Dwayne's making a very good point.  I might find a nice selection for Dwayne if you really want to.  It'll ruin it for, for any group of people.  Yeah.  It, it ruins it, uh, if, if there's a small group that, that screw up all the time.  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  It's never, people already remember the screwed up, messed up things you did.  They never remember the, the nice things you did.  Well, the best anyone can do is limit the bad stuff and, uh, you know, do more of the good 
[03:12:30]  stuff.  There you go.  All right.  All right, Dwayne.  All right, punching out.  Thanks, Dwayne.  All right.  All right.  On line, uh, five.  Punching, punching out a white guy in the head at Mardi Gras.  Well, it's like whatever, it's not, it's not that anything, anytime people in your, your  racial or ethnic group do something wrong, it's a reflection.  But you'd like, you know, black guys see that they're like, oh, now they're going to think  all black people do that.  When you see, like, skinhead violence, you're like, oh, great, now black's going to stare  at me in the mall.  You know what I mean?  Well, you know, you with your, your shaved head, Jimmy. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And my big boots and my, you know, my anti-Jew attitude.  But I'm just saying that.  There is a stigma, though, on that, too.  And not so much, Jimmy.  Jimmy's too cute and cuddly to be a skinhead.  But there are these big guys that shave their heads, walk around, and, and they have this  stigma on them that, you know, they're going to start, you know, smashing queers in the  face with their, uh, with their boots.  And, uh, you know, that's something they have to deal with.  I have this weird aggression I get from black crowds sometimes.  I have a crew cut. 
[03:13:30]  They don't think I'm a skinhead.  They don't, I don't come off like that.  But there's something about me that they, I just feel that vibe.  Really?  Yeah.  Um, my sexual stuff kills.  But any of the other stuff, maybe it's the attitude or it's the way I deliver things.  I just remind them of this annoying, angry white guy that they hate.  I don't know what it is, but I get this really weird vibe where it's just this, I can't  do it on the radio, but this.  That, that, uh, that exasperated, irritated stare.  That's the look Patrice gives you every time he looks at you.  That's because I remind him of food.  He wants to sink his teeth out of me. 
[03:14:00]  He just goes.  That's, that's, that's Patrice's, I'm trying to look like I'm making it up as I go along  face that, that, that, that, that size squint where he kind of mushes his fat face.  I love that guy.  Yeah, he's a very, very funny guy.  Holy jeez, look who's in here.  It's a celebrity.  We saw you on TV.  Nice smock, leather face. 
[03:14:30]  It's big.  You're wearing a, you're wearing a Texas Chainsaw Massacre smock there.  That's right.  After you're done working for homosexual artists, you can hack up their awful redheaded wives.  Can you, hey, can you tell that bitch to take off her Lucille ball wig the next time she's  on television, a Mrs. Carmichael?  Oh, Viv, aren't the gates beautiful?  Another Philip Morris, please. 
[03:15:00]  This art is called the phlegm.  Ricky, give me another Philip Morris.  I can't get all of it.  Look at, look at that smile.  You get to keep that?  I do.  That's like a collector's item now.  I suppose, yeah.  And it's been on television.  It has.  It's got a little pocket in the front to hold your AZT in.  Did you get to meet the couple?  You met Christo?  I had lunch with them yesterday.  You had lunch with Christo?  How many people are working on this project? 
[03:15:30]  600.  600.  How many people had lunch with Christo yesterday?  Nine.  You are a networking mother effer.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  How did you swing that?  You're telling me to get William Shatner to help put up the...  That's it.  And other great celebrities.  Bolting this piece of crap together.  Perhaps if I jump through the gate, I'll go back in time and be able to save the Enterprise.  You lunched with him?  Yes.  And are you a lead man on one of these crews?  I'm not, actually. 
[03:16:00]  You're not?  No.  How did you swing lunch with the great Christo?  Right place, right time.  Know what to say.  Jesus Christo.  We have room at our table, Christo.  I hear...  He eats with the crew.  One thing I hear, though, is Poe is there and he ran out on the check.  Is that the...  No?  No?  Well, he's actually going to be standing at the front of the gates making people fill out  40 minutes of paperwork.  That's true.  Before they walk through and enjoy the colors.  Before they walk through each gate.  That's why they're only expecting 90,000 instead of a million. 
[03:16:30]  My goodness.  So, you got a little name tag there with your picture on it.  Everybody.  And a number.  Can you get Christo on our show?  I could try.  Where is he from?  Bulgaria.  Bulgaria.  The country of who cares?  He's speaking?  They've been in the United States for 40 years.  That is his wife, right?  41 years.  Yeah.  41 years they've lived in Manhattan for 41 years, but they do work all over the world.  And he was thrown out of Panzerfaust.  I don't believe he was a member of that.  No, that was the Mexican.  Bulgarian? 
[03:17:00]  No, it was Mexican.  Yeah, it was the Mexican.  Yeah, with the round face.  So, he's lived in America, though?  Yeah.  Wow, I thought he was, like, some foreigner.  They both consider themselves American artists who were born in other countries because they  came here and they reside here now.  But their work is, they do work all over the world.  Does it bother him that his wife looks like one of those little pencil things you put in  your hand and rub your hands together and the hair kind of flops against his wife?  I don't think it bothers him.  Did you ever ask him, hey, Christo, how do you fuck that Sesame Street character that 
[03:17:30]  you married back in 1956?  She was, if you can see some of the old pictures, she was quite the looker in the day.  Really?  Yeah, she was attractive.  Yeah, before electricity.  You're all right, honey.  They're just getting old now, you know.  Old people.  Yeah.  That hair color, though.  Wow.  How does that look live?  It's much brighter live.  Brighter and vibrant like the cascading material over the gates, right? 
[03:18:00]  It's much brighter than that.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's a little disturbing.  That is something.  Could you tell her for me that her haircut would look perfect if she were in the backseat  of a limo in Dealey Plaza with her head back into the left?  Exactly.  Sure.  I'll pass that message along.  Oh.  Great.  You were good on TV today.  Thank you.  You were very excited.  It was 7 in the morning.  It's so exciting, you were.  Actually, it was 7.30 in the morning, and we had already been working an hour and a half.  Do we have the clip?  It's pretty quick.  I want to just hear how excited Kev sounds. 
[03:18:30]  I threw that one away.  It was so awful.  Why?  This is like...  I'm very excited to be here and be a part of this.  It's a dream come true.  It's a Guinness book where most cliches actually fit into one small...  So close to home.  It's a childhood dream.  A dream come true.  It wouldn't miss it for the world.  It's true.  Two gates in the bush are worth one in the hand.  You know, I'll cross that gate when I come to it, and here it is.  Can't judge a part of it.  The installation began in spring-like weather earlier this week, and we found among the workers, morale was high. 
[03:19:00]  I'm honored and thrilled to be able to work on one of his pieces that's so close to my home, and I'm excited.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm excited to be able to work on one of his artworks.  It wasn't exciting you enough.  Maybe if it was Stone Phillips. 
[03:19:30]  I did talk to John Wooten from ABC, though.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, he was very nice.  But you've always wanted to work on his piece, basically.  On one of his artworks, yes.  I like how it said Big Kev on there.  I did say that, yeah.  And then a crazy last name.  That's my crazy last name.  Oh, my God.  You see the spell?  I didn't even know what it's spelled.  What is your last name?  Nine random letters.  Yeah.  All right.  Mike's keeping it on the QT.  No, not that one. 
[03:20:00]  Not that one.  Wow.  I saved myself.  I so saved myself.  It's so dangerous to point at a hot chick on TV.  I so saved myself.  When the picture changes as I turned around and it was a man-ass or something.  There's legislation going on in Virginia.  We haven't gotten to this story yet.  They want to make it illegal to have your pants too low.  Yeah.  Something like that.  They really have run out of things to do in Washington.  That's a bit much.  So, I guess they were showing some footage of people that keep their pants too low. 
[03:20:30]  And the first one was the nice tee back with the low-riding jeans.  Sticking out the top of the girl's pants.  The low-riding jeans.  So, while you guys are talking, I went, ugh.  And everyone turned their head just when I said that to show some wigger with his stupid  boxers, you know, completely out of his pants.  Yeah, pulled down.  And his jeans down on his knees, basically.  But before we turned back, they went right back to the girl with the thong.  Thank God.  So, for like a split second.  Thank God.  I actually looked up and just saw that faggot newsman who stalked his ex on methamphetamines.  Oh, yeah.  That creep. 
[03:21:00]  Well, why don't you do it?  I love that clip.  You do it, Billy.  Why don't you do it?  Oh, yeah.  That was them.  Come on, Billy.  Don't interrupt me if you're not the anchor.  Guy was pissed.  If you're not excited and thrilled and honored, don't interrupt me.  You want to play that real fast?  Joey, we lucked out.  One morning, we're just taping Channel 7.  And the guy that Jimmy's talking about, he couldn't pronounce Donald Trump's wife there.  I think he said, can't.  I don't know what he said.  Yeah, very good. 
[03:21:30]  The weather guy just, as you could tell, is just a wise-ass.  Thought it was the funniest thing.  And then they just started going at it live on TV.  Listen to this.  Have you seen this?  This is a big dress.  It's something old, something new, and something that costs about 100 grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress made for a supermodel.  Melania Nels, the former or the future.  Why don't you go over that name again, Steve?  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over it? 
[03:22:00]  What did you do it?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  I'm going to park down over there during the video.  Go ahead, do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor, then don't interrupt me.  I would just do it.  I wanted to know what you said.  No, if you're not the anchor, then don't.  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed by John Galliano for Christian New York.  And the bride plans another dress of hero-winning design after the couple's first dance wedding is set for Saturday.  Why don't you give it a shot there, Bill?  Hey, I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing the audience. 
[03:22:30]  I heard, no.  And I'm just saying, my bad, my bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I'm not looking for an apology, Steve.  I'm just saying, would you like to take another shot?  No, I wouldn't.  I don't know.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read that stuff.  It is so cold outside.  It is cold outside.  It's cold in here, too.  You can take a shot at the weather if you want to.  I don't know.  I'm talking about it.  I'm good with that.  Hey, dude.  I get paid either way.  Oh, you, you, you, you, you.  It's so cold in the weather to start today. 
[03:23:00]  And it will be a day where it will be a cold day.  How great is that?  That was real anger.  That was on live?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were sitting in the office watching one morning.  And thank God we were taping.  Because we just turn our heads.  When that happens on this show, it's just, you know, everyone piles on.  Uh-huh.  You know, he can't take a little ribbon.  He actually said the name right.  He actually said it right.  He actually did say it.  Yeah, it wasn't a bad job.  He got it right.  You could tell, though.  He was just like, oh, God. 
[03:23:30]  Why don't you do it there, Billy?  Yeah.  Why don't you do it there, Billy?  Wow.  He's pissed.  That was great.  What a baby.  The guy ribs him a little, and then he just can't let it go.  We've got to play the KABC one now, too.  Yeah, that's a good one.  This is like 10 years old, we found out.  But there was an anchor team in L.A.  This is right before they go on the air.  I guess they hated each other.  The mics were on as they're just getting ready to start the news.  And I think what goes on, in between the 6 o'clock and 11 o'clock news, the female anchor goes home.  And rumor has it, according to this guy, because he brings it up, that she drinks in between the newscasts. 
[03:24:00]  And then her attitude and her personality and her demeanor changes when she comes back for the 11 o'clock news.  So they were having some kind of tiff, and he just went at it with this girl.  Listen to this.  First segment.  It's done that way all the time.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better talk about it.  You hear me complaining about it?  Then we better talk about it.  Tonight I'm complaining, because tonight I said hate.  Then we better talk about it, because I think you've got a problem.  I think we've got a problem.  All right?  If that's what you think, then we'll talk about it after the show, and we'll talk about it with Roger Bell. 
[03:24:30]  Because I'm not going to sit here night after night and put up with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  Night after night?  Well, it looks to me like that's the way it's going to go, Ann.  I'll take the ante up a little higher than that, even.  You're not only wrong, you're way out of line.  Let me tell you something.  You started it, pal.  If you want Harold Green, you might get him.  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Oh, is it really?  Good old Harold Green.  Okay.  Okay.  You want to start dealing with shit? 
[03:25:00]  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get it.  You know, you go home and have a couple of shooters, and I don't know what the fuck happens,  but when you come back, you're not the same lady.  That's not true.  Some nights it is, Ann.  When news happens, you see it happen on Channel 7.  The number one station for news and information in Southern California.  Now, Paul Moyer, Ann Martin, Johnny Mountainweather, and Todd Donahoe Sports. 
[03:25:30]  This is Eyewitness News tonight.  Three men dead tonight in an execution-style murder in Los Angeles.  Christmas as usual.  Nothing happened.  Hose it down and move on.  Hose down the anchor desk.  We're ready to broadcast.  When you go home, you have a couple of shooters, and you're not the same person when you get  back here.  Unbelievable.  Wow, that's great.

[03:28:00]  And he'll sing you a soft lullaby, and he'll sing you a soft lullaby, and he'll sing you a soft lullaby.  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus.  I think that's why your mommy left us.  It's pretty. 
[03:28:30]  Hush, little girl.  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke.  Daddy just wants to forget.  Tonight.  Soon, it will all be like it was before. 
[03:29:00]  Any minute, she will walk through that front door.  But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer.  Then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear.  Daddy has sores on his genitals, oozing with pus.  I think that's why your mommy left us. 
[03:29:30]  Please don't cry.  I swear I'll try.  To be here by your side.  Right after daddy gets home from the bar.  Visits his bookie and steals a new car. 
[03:30:00]  He'll drive to the strip club.  And if daddy plays his cards right.  He'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  La-dee-dai.  La-dee-dai-dai-dee-dai-dee-dai.  La-dee-dai.  La-dee-dai-dee-dai-dee-dai-dee-dai.  La-dee-dai-dee-dee-dee-dee.  La-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  La-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee- 
[03:30:30]  Very good. 
[03:31:00]  Drew Boogie in studio today.  Take it in my mouth.  How many truckers you think turned off the program today?  You think?  Nah.  You never know.  They're digging it.  All right, let's go right to the phone and say hi to Scott and PA.  Scott, what's up? 
[03:31:30]  What's up, man?  Hey, Anthony?  Yes, sir?  I just want to say there's something about your fucking laugh that just makes me fall out every time.  Ooh!  Every time.  Like that thing with Pat, when you guys play the puke?  Yeah.  I don't.  I was losing my mind.  I was losing my mind when he was doing that.  I don't know why a fat guy throwing up is hysterically funny.  There it is.  You know why? 
[03:32:00]  Because his laugh is very genuine.  You know, Anthony doesn't laugh at a lot of things, but when he does, you just know you're cracking him up big time.  Yeah, that would be it.  By the way, dude, I definitely know why you enjoy ants' laugh so much.  Don't even go there.  Why?  I just think it's contagious.  That's all there is to it.  All right.  You keep telling yourself that.  Whatever helps you, put your head on the pillow and doze off at night, sir. 
[03:32:30]  If it's because ants' laugh is contagious, I think that you picture his jiggly big Italian cock in his pants while he's laughing.  Jesus.  You had to go there?  Wow.  I'm speculating.  Damn.  Good show.  Have a good show tomorrow.  Not you.  All right.  Thank you, fella.  Here's something to help you bust a nut.  There you go.  Let's go to Pat from Munachai. 
[03:33:00]  Munachai?  Munachai.  Where's Munachai?  Hey, Pat, what's up?  Hey.  I'm going to be making an appearance tonight.  Oh, yeah?  At the Stress Factory in my favorite town, Eatontown.  Oh.  Keep in mind, there'll be a toad drink minimum.  At the more information, you can call 888-541.  Ow. 
[03:33:30]  Why is...  Oh, my neck brace.  Oh.  Is this thing on?  Why is Eatontown your favorite town?  Because I'll be Eaton there.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know the faces are being made.  Do you realize every time you tell a joke, you should do it out of the bay of the Enola gay?  Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son. 
[03:34:00]  And bald and diabetic, also.  Hello!  Exactly!  Hey, are you coming tonight, Pat?  Why, yes, I am.  What show?  8 o'clock.  All right.  And there's going to be a sticker stop there, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah, he's going to take his old toes and try to sticker them back on his foot.  I'm diabetic.  What's that, Pat?  I couldn't hear it over the car crash.  Don't sugarcoat your criticism. 
[03:34:30]  I'm diabetic, you know.  Oof.  Oh, wow.  That was awful.  Hopefully, I'll learn how it's done when I go to see Jimmy Norton at the Stress Factory in Eatontown.  Thanks, Pat.  All right, thanks.  See you, man.  Good luck.  All right, thanks.  Pat.  Yes.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[03:35:00]  Oh!  He knew he was had.  He was completely had.  On the line, some lady that has an interesting theory about wormholes.  Really?  Yes.  Hello?  Hi.  Oh.  It's me again.  Okay.  Listen, I wanted to let you know something.  Yes?  I don't know if this would help.  Maybe it would.  Are you going to admit that you're a fat drunk?  No.  Okay.  It ain't even that.  But I used to be in the military.  I was in the service at one time.  My head is swimming with possibilities. 
[03:35:30]  I was in the Navy.  Yeah.  The Iowa.  Were you a bomb called a hard-on buster?  No, I was not a bomb called a hard-on buster.  No, Jim.  I was not.  But I used to be in the service.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, we're going to analyze what Jimmy just said.  What did he mean by that?  A bomb?  No, I don't know what he meant by that.  You could be the stupidest person in the world.  No, I'm not the stupidest person in the world.  But I used to be in the service.  I wanted to let you know that. 
[03:36:00]  What branch?  Navy.  U.S. Navy.  What did you do?  Until some Jap sub slammed two torpedoes into her side.  What happened?  Did your back hurt from having planes take off on it?  No.  I knew you were going to say something more like that.  I know you did because you're brilliant.  What did you do in the Navy?  I was a cook in the service.  I was a cook and I used to serve the, you know, the service people in the service. 
[03:36:30]  That's what I did.  Could you say service again, stupid?  Service people in the service.  Service.  What rank did you attain?  E1.  I didn't stay there very long.  Is E1 good?  E1?  E1 is okay.  Isn't that the worst you could do?  That's actually, as a civilian, I actually have more authority in the Navy than an E1 does.  E1.  All right.  You're not even a seaman at that point.  You just clear stuff.  E1 must stand for eating.  She was number one at eating.  I was never on a boat. 
[03:37:00]  I was never on a ship or anything like that.  It would capsize if you went to the rail.  No.  But I figured that would help out a little bit.  She was never on a ship, but they hung her over the side so when it bumped the dock, it  wouldn't scratch it.  Where is the school doing stuff?  The last time she was on a ship, she tripped on it, and that was in 1912.  No.  The ship was not Titanic.  No.  It was not that.  Obviously.  No, no, no.  No.  I was never enlisted on a ship.  I was enlisted on base. 
[03:37:30]  Enlisted on base?  She doesn't even use the proper terminology.  Do you know, this is how uninteresting you are.  If you were on the 91st floor of the towers and you managed to escape, nobody would want  to hear your story.  You're a horribly boring person.  Awful.  I am not a horribly boring person.  I'm just telling you where I was.  How did your military career end?  Well, it ended after two years of being in the service.  And I have an honorable discharge.  An honorable, but you didn't do the full term, did you? 
[03:38:00]  I believe that was close to being the full term.  Why did you get out?  What were the circumstances of your discharge?  Well, I got out because it was not for me, exactly, back then.  It was not for me.  So what did you do after the Navy?  Well, then I went to work again.  Doing what?  Oh, boy.  Maybe I shouldn't even say this.  McDonald's?  So, you blew off the...  No, no, no, no, wait a minute.  I was living at home back then. 
[03:38:30]  You blew off the military career for McDonald's?  Mary was the corporate now.  Yeah, because the Navy wasn't for her.  Yeah.  But McDonald's, that's it.  You're brilliant.  I went to another job, and I went to another job, and I went to another job.  Why didn't you just stay in the Navy, you twat?  I should have.  Hey, who said that?  Opie?  He said it.  We all thought it and nodded.  No, no, no, no, no, no, listen to me, listen to me.  You blew off the Navy for McDonald's, that's brilliant.  And second of all, it was not exactly for me.  Well, listen, are you depressed because you were convicted of aiding terrorism as a lawyer 
[03:39:00]  today?  What?  Oh, wow, that's a good one.  Excuse me?  Of course she's.  What are you talking about?  Excuse me?  We're not even going to explain.  No, I just wanted to let you know that I wasn't just a lawyer.  What's your thoughts on Michael Jackson?  And then they helped me out.  What's your thoughts on Michael Jackson?  One of my thoughts on Michael Jackson?  Yes.  I have no, right now I have no clue, because I don't know who to believe.  Him?  Not just right now.  Or what's going on with him?  Him or what's going on with him?  Oh, wow.  Him or what is going on with him, with the kids? 
[03:39:30]  I have no idea.  All right, what do you think of Corey Feldman?  He does every day, and you know what?  We're doing a quick, shut up, we're doing a quick news roundup here.  What do you think of Corey Feldman and his latest allegation?  Who's Corey Feldman?  Exactly.  What do you think of Kim Jong-il?  Who?  She just knows nothing.  Go back to Michael Jackson.  Have you been listening to the show today?  Yes, I have.  What do you think about Prince Charles getting remarried?  I don't approve of that, but if that's what they want to do. 
[03:40:00]  All right, what about Jason Giambi and the steroid thing?  The Jason Giambi steroid thing?  Well, I'll tell you what, there's going to be a lot more things coming out in the future  about baseball players.  Like what?  Yeah, like what?  The steroids and stuff like that.  There's going to be a lot more.  Like what?  There's going to be a lot more about the steroid thing.  Like, example.  An example?  The muscular built guys and everything like that?  There's going to be a lot more coming out with that.  If you say a lot more one more time, I'm going to open your fat stomach and watch a license 
[03:40:30]  plate fall out.  Be specific.  You Kintner boy eating drunken monstrosity.  He just said, I don't have a license plate in my stomach.  Do you know what reference he was referring to there?  Me.  No.  The Pope leaves the hospital.  What do you think?  Well, I think he's going to be okay.  Seinfeld's mom, broke or rich?  Well, she's going to be okay.  How do you feel about the Hamas attack now in Israel the last couple of days? 
[03:41:00]  I love hummus.  Wait a minute.  What?  The Hamas attack recently because Abbas and Sharon shook hands and they're working out a  peace deal.  How do you feel about the Hamas attack?  Is that going to hurt things at all?  Hamas attack?  Yes.  It's kind of like a Big Mac attack, fatso.  Well, she could relate to this a little bit because when she was stationed in Yemen,  a small boat pulled up next to her and blew a hole in her side when she was in the Navy. 
[03:41:30]  That's how she got out.  Hey, were you depressed when they pushed Leon Klinghoffer off your shoulder?  I was in San Diego for a little bit and then I got out.  And I was living in...  Wait, you were in San Diego in the Navy and that wasn't good enough for you?  So you came home to work at a McDonald's in Jersey somewhere?  Well, for a little bit.  And then after that I got a regular job.  And after that I just kept on going on from job to job.  Drew Boogie in studio.  Hit us up with something.  We're going to play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:42:00]  Let's go to Pinchy.  Pinchy, what's up, buddy?  Hey guys, how are you?  Pretty good.  Hey.  Hey, boo-boo.  Hi, Pinchy.  Hey.  Hey, today I learned from Opie that Mexicans have round faces.  Very good.  Oh.  Very good.  Thank you.  Let's go to Keith.  Hey, Keith, what did you learn on the program today?  I learned that if I come to the XM Studios...  And by the way, hi, boys.  Hi, Cucumber Stick.  Hi, Angel Eyes.  If I come on the show, I've got to give my information.  My information is going to be listed as Jim Norton, my address, Stress Factory on Route 35. 
[03:42:30]  That's in Eatontown, New Jersey.  That would be my address.  But I only live there February 11th and 12th.  My phone number is 888-541-HA-HA.  My website, if I would have one to list, would be eatabullet.com.  I have an alias, which is Jim Norton.  I'm the best comedian on the planet.  I'm also known as Jim Norton, and I have a CD, which is Yellow Discipline.  And I have an email, which is yellowtreat at AOL.com.  Watch it out, boys.  Feel free to call anytime, sir.  You're what we call a good egg.  All right, let's go to Steve in Jersey. 
[03:43:00]  Steve?  Hey, boys.  I learned that a lady's eye should buckle down and pick herself up by her horseshoes.  And an E1 is not even semen, just clear stuff.  Day to night.  Very good.  Ben's raw ass checking in.  What did you learn, Ben?  Hey, Drew Boogie rocks, if I want to say that.  Nice, yeah.  And I also learned that the vendors in Central Park are going to be selling java logs and  cheese and crackers.  All right, let's relax.  Very nice.  Dope boy.  I learned that Drew Boogie is the best in-house guest. 
[03:43:30]  We need him back more often.  Yep.  Yeah, we'll have him back again.  I think it worked very well today.  Later, boys.  All right.  Let's go to whoever this is.  What did you learn on the program?  Yo, guys.  What's up?  What's up, Buckbunker?  Hey, hey.  Yo, guys, I learned that passing monarchy has to be upgraded from a car crash to a train  crash.  We call that a rich loss.  Oh.  Jeremy from Jersey.  Hey, boys.  I learned that if you cut Lady Di open, that little Kittner boy spills that all over the 
[03:44:00]  dock.  Very nice.  Let's say hi to Porky.  Hey, Porky.  Hey, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned Lady Di got discharged for swallowing femen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to thank Joey Paisano for stopping by and saying hi.  Thanks, Joey.  Paisano's up Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Go there.  Say Opie and Anthony sent you, and Joey will throw you a glass of wine. 
[03:44:30]  Great food down there in Little Italy.  Norton, we'll see you tonight.  Don't worry.  You don't need a plug in.  For $7,000.  You don't need to plug anything.  And Drew Boogie wants you to take us out.  Drew Boogie, thank you so much for being the in-house DJ today.  Keith the Cop, what?  What?  The virus coming to Mafia Life.  Mafia Life.com.  Oh.  That was officially the worst plug I've ever heard.  Horrible plug.  The worst plug ever.  All right.  It's going to work.  No confidence in it.  All right.  Let's let Drew Boogie take us out here. 
[03:45:00]  Thank you.  We'll see you Monday.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Program complete. </pre>
