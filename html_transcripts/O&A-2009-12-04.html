<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in sexually explicit jokes before launching into a furious rant about their perceived mistreatment by SiriusXM.  They voiced complaints about being overlooked for promotions in favor of Howard Stern and Rosie O'Donnell, the rejection of their pay-per-view idea featuring old video content (which they had to repurchase themselves), and their dissatisfaction with their agent.  A major point of contention was their refusal to participate in what they considered "shitty bar gigs," contrasting their current status with their past experiences. They also criticized SiriusXM's marketing and PR department for failing to effectively promote their viral videos, specifically a Jesse Ventura and Jim Norton confrontation video that garnered hundreds of thousands of views.  They boasted about their own superior self-promotion skills.  Jim Norton was frequently mentioned, particularly in relation to the Ventura video.  The hosts also heavily promoted their upcoming "Homeless Shopping Spree" event, launching a new Twitter account (@OAHSS) for it. A phone call with Keith, responsible for recruiting participants, revealed difficulties in finding homeless people willing to participate.

The show then reacted to Bill O'Reilly airing a shortened, unattributed version of the Ventura/Norton video.  This led into a lengthy, vulgar commentary on Steven Seagal's show, "Lawman," filled with jokes about Seagal's appearance and persona.  The discussion included a bizarre anecdote about a Catholic priest praising Seagal's charitable work in Thailand, and listener calls contributed further details and opinions.

A substantial portion focused on Tiger Woods' car accident and the ensuing media coverage, with the hosts and a caller rating various sexually suggestive and offensive newspaper jokes about the incident.  They also expressed dislike for the media's portrayal of Woods.  The show also offered a generally positive (but slightly critical) review of Jesse Ventura's "Conspiracy Show." A caller's insulting tweet about one of the hosts was read and met with a dismissive, vulgar response.

In-studio guests included Rich Voss and two homeless men participating in the "Homeless Shopping Spree," DJ and Tim ("Liquor Man").  The hosts made numerous offensive comments about the homeless men's appearances.  A lengthy discussion ensued about a picture of an obese man on an airplane, with the hosts criticizing his size and expressing safety concerns.  The show briefly touched upon the Islanders and Jets sports teams.  Numerous obscene "fuck you" messages from listener voicemails were played.  A segment debated the pronunciation of names, including Jesse Ventura's, and harshly criticized a voiceover actress referred to as "Sexy Patty."

A significant portion featured a conversation with DJ and Tim. The hosts delved into their lives on the streets, discussing living situations, panhandling, alcohol consumption (especially Liquor Man's heavy vodka intake), family relationships, and past experiences, including time in Rikers Island.  Liquor Man revealed he had children and grandchildren, including a son in the Army, whom he hadn't told about his homelessness.  Tim, who is a beatboxer, performed briefly.  The conversation also touched upon Michael Jackson's alleged child molestation and various NYC locations.

Following this, Rich Voss joined the show.  The conversation shifted to Voss's upcoming performance, then veered into discussions about Dr. Drew's reality shows, Voss's personal life and struggles, punctuated by caller interruptions and tangents. The segment concluded with continued promotion of the "homeless shopping spree" and Rich Voss's comedy shows, including mentions of posting photos and videos of the homeless men on social media.

A later segment largely focused on Rich Vos's personal life, particularly his relationship with his wife, Bonnie.  Vos recounted a Thanksgiving dinner where his father disliked Bonnie's gravy, giving her a bouillon cube as a gift. He discussed a recent argument with Bonnie about work-life balance, accusations of selfishness, and a recent sexual encounter.  He also recounted career ups and downs and a past sexual fantasy.  The segment included a bit involving intern Jonathan, who was unintentionally featured in a Ventura interview video and subsequently mocked online. A backstage interview with Jonathan was played. The segment also included plugs for Rich Vos's stand-up performances and the Bella Donna's Winter Wonderland raffle, discussion of Jim Norton's Ventura interview, clips from news coverage of the event, and a bizarre segment involving E-Rock smelling Rich Vos' ear and Jim Norton's belly button to determine which smelled worse.  The broadcast consistently featured coarse language, offensive jokes, and insensitive comments throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, deviant.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete bullshit.  This show is never short of characters.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Coo-coo, coo-coo, coo-coo.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus, and I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi.  Good morning.  Hi.  That's right.  Another live show from the boys.  I say...  That's what we do.  T-G-I-F, Opie.  That's what I say.  T-G-I-F.  I say fuck Friday and the asshole.  I don't disagree.  Eh?  I say G-A-I-D-S. 
[00:01:30]  G-A-I-D-S.  Thank God it's...  No, no.  It's just get AIDS.  Oh.  Just get AIDS!  Ah!  Ah!  That's your rally cry.  Like William Wallace and Freedom?  Yes!  Get AIDS!  They disembowel me.  Oh!  Oh!  What? 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony.  The workhorses of satellite radio.  Oh!  Hi!  Dude, those lasers could be the most annoying thing ever.  Oh, we got another one.  Oh!  Opie and Anthony.  The workhorses of satellite radio.  I like that one.  I want to call us something else of satellite radio. 
[00:02:30]  The fucking...  Yeah.  The soccer ball.  The fucking bitches.  The...  The fucking...  The pieces of shit.  What?  The...  Oh, the...  The...  Oh, yeah.  The...  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  Yeah, the...  Mm-mm.  Of satellite radio.  Yeah.  Because we get...  Because we get treated very well here.  Yeah.  I love coming in, and in such a limited time... 
[00:03:00]  We love you.  Between the time I get here and the time we're on the air, it's just chock full of shit.  It's chock full of just information that is nothing but shit.  That has happened either overnight or within the week or shit I didn't hear about or new  stuff or whatever.  I'm just baffled in general.  I'm boggled.  Yesterday, there were people upset with us because we're...  We don't want to do a bar gig. 
[00:03:30]  We don't want to do a bar gig.  I'm like, does Howard Stern do bar gigs?  Uh, no.  Okay.  There you go.  No, no.  Believe it or not, we feel like we're on the same level as Howard Stern.  This might be outrageous to you, but that's how we think, that's how we always have thought,  and we'll continue to think like.  Look, we certainly don't make the cash that he does, and as far as the way the company  sees us, that's never going to happen, and I understand that. 
[00:04:00]  Whatever.  Whatever.  I've accepted it.  But the thing is, without even bringing that name up at the end of the call, without even  bringing it up, it's like, we've been doing radio, quality radio, for many years in many  fucking places, and we've always delivered and done our job, and we're still doing it.  Can I break that down?  You and I got together 15 years ago.  We had to take two and a half years off, so that brings us down to 12 and a half years 
[00:04:30]  of quality radio.  Then we had to take about three months off after we got fired from Boston, so that pushes  it to about 12 years of quality.  And then, out of the 12 years, we probably had a shitty year.  That still is about 11 great years of radio.  You know what it is?  Yeah, yeah.  Let me correct your math there.  Out of the 12 years, how many were shitty?  I will admit to one shitty year of radio.  There you go, message boards. 
[00:05:00]  Run with that.  How many years do you think was shitty radio?  Copy, paste, copy, paste.  Same 10 people gonna read my response.  Go fuck yourselves.  What I don't understand, though.  We don't need you when you know that.  Is unlike somebody that's voice tracking down the hallway or something, we're past the point  of standing at a bar and introing a band or standing at a bar to shake some hands. 
[00:05:30]  We will absolutely go and do an event that is relative to our program, our show.  That's fine.  The philosophy changed years ago, and Eric Logan was the one that did it.  He said, when you guys go out in public, it should be bigger than life.  He said, your days of doing the shitty bar gigs, the shitty sales gigs are long over.  Based on sales.  And he says, as a company, this is when it was just XM. 
[00:06:00]  As a company, we should understand that.  And if we're gonna get you guys out there, it's gotta be huge.  And with that said, we can make huge money off sponsorships that way.  Yeah.  But you guys should not be doing any of these shitty gigs anymore.  So when the guy yesterday...  Whatever.  The guy.  We'll call him the guy.  The guy pizza guy.  He suggested basically a glorified bar gig.  I'm like, I was polite.  I'm like, no.  But if you're making it to some kind of big event, then we'll listen. 
[00:06:30]  We're saying if there's some way we can figure it out where it's good, it relates to the show,  it doesn't look like the square peg in the round hole kind of thing that we're doing, then fine.  But my fucking days of getting on a stage and introing a fucking band thing.  Hi.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're from Sirius Satellite Radio, Channel 202.  Let's bring out...  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Get fucking out of here.  Exactly.  Get out of here.  Not doing that anymore.  And if you sit there and go, oh, prima donnas. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  You're right.  We're fucking prima donnas.  We've earned...  Nuts.  We've earned being prima donnas to that extent.  No, it's not even that.  I'm saying it.  It's not even that.  We want to be doing big, over-the-top events.  You know, that's what we're about now.  I'm putting it in language they understand.  Because they will only look at us being prima donnas.  Prima donnas is on the other side of...  I'll never identify that.  I'm just saying...  On the other side of the floor, that's a prima donna who doesn't do anything.  We're still willing to do things. 
[00:07:30]  They have to just be bigger than life.  So I kind of explained this to the guy nicely.  No, I understand.  And whatever.  It's not about him.  But I was explaining it to him nicely.  And then I'm watching him down the hall just losing his mind.  He can't understand why we're not doing this.  I'm like, you don't get it.  We're not doing that.  We're just not doing that.  We'll do another animation festival.  But I heard there was problems with that.  How about an animation festival?  How about a fucking comedy tour thing?  All those things we used to do.  Well, the comedy tour... 
[00:08:00]  Oh, of course.  We need some...  Well, no.  The comedy tour...  They want a lot of involvement in that now.  For what?  I don't know.  For what?  I don't know.  It's not their gig.  It's our event.  It's our event.  It made so much news and got so many fucking fans there and everything.  It was great.  And why?  Why aren't we doing that?  I don't know.  Why aren't we doing fucking...  And then I woke up to an email from our dumb agent.  And he is dumb. 
[00:08:30]  He completely...  I'm fucking losing my mind with him, too.  I'm on a war path today.  Is it a video of him playing his coronet?  He really is the worst.  I wish he was playing it, but it was accidentally a shotgun.  Toodley!  By Note 3, his brains roll over the stupid garage wall.  That shitty instrument.  The French horn.  Oh, that's what it is.  The French horn.  Stupid French horn.  I'll give you a Greek horn, you motherfucker.  Bend over.  Exactly. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, it's a fucking semi-rig.  Man!  You're fucking plowing to him.  He wrote me and said that the company has rejected  our idea of doing a pay-per-view with our old videos.  And, you know, our agent wants us to sit down with you-know-who.  And I'm like, no, I'm not sitting down with that guy.  That's your job.  You sit down with him.  What was the...  Why would they reject making money on the old material?  I have no fucking idea what...  Jeez, after all... 
[00:09:30]  I don't know why they would reject the pay-per-view.  It's crazy.  Because it, once again, gets the name out for the company.  It gets our brand name out there.  And, yeah, it brings in money.  I don't even know why they rejected it.  After all the fucking hassle we went through to get...  To buy our material back from some guy who fucking held it hostage.  That still works for us.  Executive producer.  And that's why I don't talk to you anymore, Steve.  And all that.  And now we can't fucking use it to...  We bought it back. 
[00:10:00]  We bought our own shit back.  Yeah.  And we can't use...  You know, I'm disgusted with just about everybody at this point.  Are you disgusted with me?  I am disgusted...  No.  But that's coming very quickly.  I hope not.  It's coming very quickly.  If the Caroline's gig sucks, I will be disgusted with you.  By Monday, Anthony will hate me.  Mediocrity personified.  You are a genius.  Shut it.  Yeah, we had to buy our own fucking videos back from one of our guys.  And that's why I don't talk to you anymore, Steve.  What? 
[00:10:30]  Completely ridiculous.  And now we can't use it to do the pay-per-view?  Trust me, we'll have a professional relationship.  But, you know, the days of a little chit-chat is long gone.  That was a shit move on your part.  And fucking this company not going with the pay-per-view.  I don't understand that.  So, Bob, you sit down and talk to those guys.  And knock some sense into it.  Yeah, I'm not sitting down with any of these people.  And this will be the last one.  And then we will move on and do another quality show.  Because that's what we do on a daily basis. 
[00:11:00]  Just like this.  The company also promised us a week where the entire Sirius platform could hear this show.  Because when they did it for Howard, I lost my fucking mind that they were doing that and not doing anything for us.  And we had to promote it on our channel, even though, you know, for some reason, our names cannot appear on Howard's channel.  Which, that makes sense from a company standpoint.  But I sat down with Scott.  I go, this is ridiculous.  We could use some free exposure ourselves. 
[00:11:30]  And it's a very easy thing to do.  He goes, well, we're going to try it with Howard.  Then I think we're going to do it with football.  And then by the end of the year, we'll do it with you guys.  Well, the end of the year is here.  And no one is talking to me about that.  So, I just want to bring it out there that I don't forget.  And I'm keeping track.  So, stop lying to our faces.  If you're going to do it, you do it.  But don't make believe you're going to do it.  We've been around this business, you know, a long time.  We know when people are feeding us bullshit. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, and then you end up with the beginning of a show like this.  Well, it's everything.  I know.  Everything's up.  And then we got a video out there.  This Jesse Ventura video and Jimmy, the big, huge confrontation video.  Now, one of these motherfuckers even acknowledges that we just got international coverage for SiriusXM and ourselves.  Not one of these motherfuckers.  Not one fucking guy.  Has any of our chicks been on the news saving a puppy or a kitten? 
[00:12:30]  No?  No.  Well, okay.  Then we saw.  I could get my chick to love animals, I guess.  That'll make some news.  All right.  Maybe I could try to do that.  Do that.  My girl loves animals.  You may have seen a horse gag.  But this is a good girl.  But this video is everywhere.  It's not slowing down.  It's the second most watched video on all of YouTube right now.  God damn.  Get out of here.  Yeah, it is.  What's it, Jimmy?  It's 320,000 views right now. 
[00:13:00]  Wow.  320,000 fucking views.  And Orbitcast.  That's 100,000 more than.  I checked yesterday.  There was like 200 and something.  Dude, Orbitcast.com did a whole article on how we know how to fucking push our shit out there and market ourselves with viral marketing.  Where we take pieces of our show and we make sure we get it out there.  We get it out there.  I don't even know who the PR person is here anymore.  I just don't know who it is.  Is it Mars?  The PR person.  Sorry, I thought you meant it. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know.  I've seen a few N's.  Yes.  A few of them.  Well, tell him I spilled cereal all over the rug.  Get the PR in here.  This rug needs a cleaning.  I don't want anyone confused.  When you see Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton videos out there, it's us pushing it like a motherfucker because we're smart motherfuckers.  These guys that work in the marketing and PR department aren't smart people.  They don't even realize that, wow, Jesse Ventura walking out and almost punching one of the hosts in the face. 
[00:14:00]  They don't even realize that that could be really good past the satellite radio world.  We do all that.  So Orbicast did a whole thing acknowledging that we're really good at marketing ourselves and getting shit out there.  Good for Orbicast.  And then they're like, you know, just to put it in perspective, on the SiriusXM site, their best video did 100, and I think they said 170,000 views, but it's been up there for eight months.  This Jesse Ventura, Jim Norton confrontation video, in one day has done 200 at the time. 
[00:14:30]  It has done 226,000.  Frequent guest, Jimmy Norton.  I've never seen a company who likes publicity for free.  Understandable.  You know how to get publicity for free.  I've never seen anybody handle two videos that were already done.  And when you do it, when you share an Osborne with Jesse Ventura, you're not thinking that.  You're really not.  But it's like they're there, and they have company branding, and I've never seen two things handled that poorly. 
[00:15:00]  You know what they'll do?  Or not, or that completely ignored.  Mark my word, not only will they continue to handle the video portion of this show poorly, they will sit down with us.  I bet you sooner than later and say, we don't want you filming anymore.  I will bet you money on that.  Oh, don't give them ideas.  I will bet you money.  Jesus.  Don't give them ideas.  Yeah.  Like, they need more ideas.  Give them ideas.  That don't work.  They couldn't be...  That's a good idea.  We'll have to stop filming.  They couldn't be that.  They couldn't be that. 
[00:15:30]  Please, before you even finish that statement, think back at everything they've done.  They really are that.  Yes, exactly.  Wow.  Exactly.  You know.  But if you're a famous person, man, they'll fucking bend over backwards for you.  It's the cut off your nose to spite your face.  That's the mistake we made.  It's really weird.  We should have tried to become famous somewhere else before we did radio, and then we would  have been treated really, really nice.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I mean, they've cried poverty with us for over a year. 
[00:16:00]  We're trying to get guys raises, and honestly, not to cry poverty, but our situation sucks  too.  It really does compare to everybody else, and we've brought that to their attention, and  oh, the economy, people losing jobs, blah, blah, blah.  And they're like, all right, so you kind of suck it up, and then you have to listen to  them signing Rosie for a ridiculous number, and then fucking building a studio in her  house.  Yeah.  They don't take care of the people they already have here that are doing the right thing. 
[00:16:30]  I built a studio in my house, and I got in trouble for it.  Yeah.  Which was another thing that added to our show that they don't understand.  Exactly.  They don't understand.  It's bizarro world radio.  We love you, Jim.  Pay it out.  No.  That is literally like a guy you're in a cell with, putting you on your stomach, and deep  dicking you, and going, I know this hurts me more than it hurts you.  No, it doesn't. 
[00:17:00]  No, it doesn't.  Silly.  It's just unbelievable.  You cry poverty, and then they sign that crazy Rosie O'Donnell deal, and build her a  studio.  How about you take some of that fucking money and take care of the guys that you know are  doing the job?  I'm privy to some numbers, and they're very fucking impressive.  They're very fucking impressive.  Oh, God.  Oh, hi, everybody.  Welcome.  Opie and Anthony show.  You know what we'll do?  What?  We'll learn from our past mistakes. 
[00:17:30]  This would usually be a two-hour bitch fest.  Let's take a break.  Yeah.  Come out of the break, fucking rockin', and we'll just go into our show.  You know what?  You know what calmed me down?  What?  Just now, just thinking about it.  What?  The idea that Steven Seagal is on television.  Did you see it?  Oh, did I ever.  All right, let's do it after the break.  I didn't see Lawman.  Oh, dude.  Let's do it after the break.  I got to calm down.  Please.  Because I want to know all about Steven Seagal. 
[00:18:00]  And can we also discuss, when we come back, the show that Jesse plugged?  I don't think we've talked about that yet.  Really?  Yes, the conspiracy show.  You saw that?  I saw probably the last 20 minutes I was working, and I came back in the last 20 minutes.  Oh, and a big fuck you.  This will be the last fuck you.  It is a fuck you Friday.  F.U. Friday, right?  Yeah, I think so.  My last fuck you goes out to Bill O'Reilly.  That cunt.  What happened?  I heard he played our video.  Yeah, but he didn't comment about it because he hates us.  He didn't fucking mention our names because he hates us. 
[00:18:30]  And then he cut the video right when it was getting good.  Oh, he just wanted the shock value of Jesse cursing or something, right?  Well, I got it.  Was that it?  You want to wait for it after the break?  You want to?  What did he play?  I heard he played it.  Post break.  We come back with a brand new show.  All right.  Post break, O'Reilly played the video that we pushed out there, not SiriusXM.  What happened?  And they stopped it right as Jesse patted Jim on the back and gave him a look like, you 
[00:19:00]  know, a way to serve your country or whatever.  And that was it.  The really good stuff, they did not play.  But that's the no spin zone for you.  But what was the push of him playing it?  I didn't see it.  I was doing Caroline.  I don't even know.  He just played it.  I guess it was, yeah, here's a former senator, governor, governor, excuse me, using foul language,  perhaps.  I don't know.  And then he had one of his dumb little snide remarks at the end of it. 
[00:19:30]  You'll see.  Okay.  You know, it's good exposure, trust me.  No spin zone.  But when you call yourself the no spin zone.  Not good exposure if he doesn't mention the names.  Well, no.  Jesse.  No, the Opie and Anthony show was prominently displayed.  Oh, the logo is there on the end?  Well, it was part of all the other messy shit that goes on.  Was there another logo on there?  Was it on there?  No.  Where's the cog?  Where's the flaming cog? 
[00:20:00]  I don't know what a flaming cog is.  It's a gear.  I don't know.  Fucking.  Where's the flaming cock?  Oops, cog.  Shit.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  I'm just disgusted.  That's a cog, Jimmy.  Jimmy, where have you been?  Look at the cog.  That's the flaming cog.  You know, his logo that was all over our videos.  What Danny just put up, I know that show.  It's terrible.  Yes.  Not that, but what you wrote. 
[00:20:30]  It's like cog.  You know, because he decided that he needed to brand himself a head of the Opie and Anthony show.  And he wonders why I don't talk to him anymore.  Done.  Done!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, we're starting here.  We're going to make believe that first half hour didn't work.  Yeah, that's it.  Now we're starting the show over again, I guess. 
[00:21:00]  You better keep that in the replay.  I'm proud of that first half hour.  Get rid of the rage.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton's playing Caroline's.  How did it go last night, Jimmy?  It was good.  And I hear the counts for tonight, tomorrow are very good.  So I have to give away tickets.  I'll do it at one point.  Just call up if you want tickets to a show.  Say for Sunday night, I have two pairs.  Right.  For Sunday night.  Okay.  Sunday.  Yeah.  And the magic word is testes.  Testes.  I like that.  Hey, homeless shopping spree is less than two weeks away.  I was under the impression, because I'm stupid. 
[00:21:30]  No, you're not.  And then we had three weeks when we said December 17th.  I mean, what is going on, man?  It's almost Christmas?  I know.  And then someone said, no, it's two weeks.  So we got less than two weeks now.  Two weeks from yesterday.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree at a mall somewhere in Jersey.  Less than an hour's drive from Manhattan.  Way less than an hour.  So we're hoping people take the day off and join us at the mall as the homeless do their shopping thing.  We haven't done one of these in three years.  And last night, we set up a Twitter account. 
[00:22:00]  But we're going to try something different.  Another brilliant idea on our part and not the company's part.  New show.  Huh?  We started a new show.  New show?  See, we started a new show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was just a little, you know.  A little reverting back.  A little punch as we're leaving the cage.  But the Twitter account is OAHSS.  So it's a Twitter account for the homeless shopping spree.  Right now, it just tells you the date of the homeless shopping spree. 
[00:22:30]  But what we're going to do is we're going to start posting pictures and videos of past homeless shopping sprees.  We're going to do that immediately.  And then the day of the event and everything leading up to it, I think we might have a homeless guy coming in today.  As we take pictures of the homeless guy today, possibly, we'll pop it right up there.  So you can follow what's going on with the homeless shopping spree by going to OAHSS.  And I'm so excited about this last night.  And I tweeted to everybody.  And I fucked up the tweet.  And I sent everyone to some Oregon hospital. 
[00:23:00]  I had a massive fail yesterday.  And then my tweet was retweeted by hundreds of people last night.  It was a massive fail.  Wait, what was the thing you tried to tweet?  I don't even want to say because it'll fuck it up again.  But instead of OAHSS, I...  Oh, God, no.  You could probably figure it out.  There was an extra H in there.  And then I'm like, wow, everyone's retweeting it.  No, they were fucking attacking me. 
[00:23:30]  They're like, why are you sending us to the Oregon hospital?  So then I had to tweet it again.  So it's O-A-H-S-S.  So join that Twitter account if you want to follow the happenings as far as the homeless shopping spree goes,  which is less than two weeks away.  It's Tippi Tom's pictures on there as a little memorial.  Well, yes, the Tippi Tom Memorial homeless shopping spree.  Speaking of which, we've got Keith, the cop, on the line here.  Hey, Keith.  Good morning. 
[00:24:00]  Hey, buddy.  Hey, sir.  Well, what's good is that the reliability factor hasn't changed  because I had half a dozen guys, of course, that were coming today.  And when you get to the corner, well, they're not there.  Of course not.  They're homeless.  Looking for the homeless as we speak.  Well, Steve, Keith, did you call their representatives?  Because perhaps there was a contractual issue and they refused to be on the corner.  Yeah.  Well, I've got to tell you something.  Oddly enough, homeless people this year have cell phones. 
[00:24:30]  And I did call one guy and he's, you know, I think that I'm starting from scratch here,  being that we, you know, most of our guys are dead.  Yeah.  And they're under the impression, I'm sure, that this is one of those things, again,  that they're going to get arrested.  Because one guy was so gung-ho.  And then I talked to him about 15 minutes ago.  I'm like, his name was Whitey.  And he looked like he had Down syndrome.  And he's got the monster.  And he was perfect.  And I'm like, Whitey, you know, are you showing up? 
[00:25:00]  And, you know, he's like, no, I'm going to go to detox instead.  He'd rather go to detox.  But I have his cell phone number, so we'll give him a call when I get in.  Maybe once he hears that he's on the radio.  He thinks it's like one of those television stings where you win a television,  you walk in and they arrest you.  Right, right, right.  So, I mean, you know, feeling me taking a two-hour nap,  but you want to get a little sleep and think that these guys are going to show up.  So I'm out combing the streets looking for them, 
[00:25:30]  and I shall be up shortly with our first contestants.  All right.  Very good.  Keith the cop is looking for the new crop of homeless guys for the homeless shopping spree.  Thanks, Keith.  All right.  See you a little bit.  All right.  Hopefully we'll have some homeless people up here today.  Yeah, he's right.  Half our guys are dead.  But the last one we did, we kind of had, you know, brand-new homeless guys,  and some say it was the best one yet.  And that one didn't have Tippi Tom as one of the guys. 
[00:26:00]  Yay!  This one won't either.  No.  No.  No.  It won't.  Poor Tippi.  Tippi's under that big porch in the sky.  Yeah.  So we got the Bill O'Reilly thing.  So the O'Reilly factor plays the ONA clip of Jim Norton and Jesse Ventura going at it.  Does it have the context in which he played the clip on there?  Yeah, I think so.  The setup and what he did with the clip.  Could he good?  Back in the book segment tonight.  Reality check where we span the globe to correct the record.  Check one.  Recently, Jesse Ventura has become a conspiracy kind of guy. 
[00:26:30]  Among other things, he believes 9-11 was an inside job  and that the government doesn't care about the military.  You said we send our guys off to war without giving a ****.  And I'm telling you, that's not true.  Yes, it is.  I agree with you.  When did you go to war?  I've never been in the military.  Where did you go, sir?  You don't know.  But I say pull them out of everything.  Because I've never been in the military, when we are attacked by, I feel, a nation, we should not...  It should be proven first.  I feel we proved it.  You feel we didn't.  You also feel that **** Bush was behind 9-11. 
[00:27:00]  So we're always going to disagree.  Hey, don't put **** words in my mouth.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Jess.  Governor.  You always just sulk and walk away.  Why?  You put words in my mouth.  Hey, there's a **** guy here telling me I got a schedule.  **** language.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bye, tough guy.  Bye, tough guy.  You sound like reasonable people, right?  That's all he did with it.  They sound like reasonable people?  Wait a minute.  That's all.  That's all. 
[00:27:30]  That's all he did.  That was sarcastic.  Of course.  And what does he mean they sound like reasonable people?  Why?  Because it's a heated discussion with real words that people use thrown in when they are angry  or having a heated discussion?  He's a phony crock of ****.  O'Reilly's probably got a worse mouth on him than anybody.  He's a smug asshole.  And I honestly would like to see the face.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  But let me tell you a couple things because he, once again, Bill O'Reilly calls his show  the No Spins Zone.  First of all, he took our video and he edited it. 
[00:28:00]  So it looks like, you heard it, that Jesse walked out right after that exchange about  the war.  When the actual video says, 20 minutes later, this is what happened.  Jesse didn't walk out because of that exchange that he had with Jimmy right there.  And then, of course, doesn't play the whole tape where it really got interesting.  When Jimmy was defending himself.  You see what O'Reilly's doing these days, too?  Like, they'll have a Muslim that did something on and obviously, you're like, oh my God, O'Reilly's 
[00:28:30]  got to just go after this guy.  Sure.  And then O'Reilly agrees with them.  Uh-huh.  And you know, in his heart of hearts, he's like, I hate this person.  I want to jump down their throat.  But in order to look like he's the No Spins Zone guy, he agrees with him.  Yeah.  And it's so obvious that he doesn't, which is spinning it.  Of course it is.  He's spinning and spinning.  His whole show is him spinning shit. 
[00:29:00]  Jimmy playing right field was a No Spins Zone compared to O'Reilly.  And then some of the clips.  Then we got another one here from Fox 9 in Minnesota discussing Jesse walking out.  Of course, you know, where Jesse was the governor.  Jesse Ventura, this morning I saw this, the Opie and Anthony radio show posted a video  of former Governor Jesse Ventura on their show walking out.  I showed you the video.  This is part of Canada, right?  Minnesota? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I believe it is.  It is, right?  It's part of Canada.  Yes, it's Cananida.  I freaking lived in Buffalo.  And when you lived in Buffalo, people sounded like they were from America.  But some of these other states, like Minnesota, that's a Canadian accent.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Absolutely.  Jesse Ventura, this morning I saw this, the Opie and Anthony radio show posted a video  of former Governor Jesse Ventura on their show walking out.  I showed you the video.  You're looking at it now. 
[00:30:00]  We can't let you listen to the audio because it's rather profane.  Rather profane.  What did you think?  He walks out after one of the comedians on the show bothers him, offends him.  Well, he's easily offended.  He's got, he's about as tough as a baby's bottom.  He's got, he's about as thin skinned as a, his onion is tougher than this guy is.  And his TV show, just the clips that I've seen on television, suggested he's peeking  into windows and peering and trying to get information. 
[00:30:30]  Now, if media were acting like that, he'd be calling us media jackals.  And also, I noticed in the commercials for this, he's wearing a sensible haircut.  He's not wearing this ridiculous, I don't know what to call those.  Okay.  That's a non-issue.  Yeah, that was a, as much as, even though the media is siding with us in a weird way,  they're still asses.  At least they mentioned the Opie and Anthem in the M&E show.  How hard is Opie and Anthony?  It's very difficult for some people.  Even Lennon messes it up.  There's something about saying it's the Opie and Opie and.  Opie and.  You almost get ahead of yourself. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, you do get ahead of yourself.  Opie and.  Opie and.  There's vowels and N's in weird places.  Yeah, yeah.  TMZ called the show Opie and Andy.  I had a fucking.  That's a good one.  We had to fucking write them and say, wake the fuck up.  I like that one.  It's Opie and Anthony, you idiots.  Yeah, let's, you know, call it the Gilligan and Skipper show, too.  Stop like that.  Stop.  Yes, I would like the Gilligan and Skipper show.  I wouldn't be the little bust.  Just fucking homoerotic drivel.  Yeah, no, let's stay.  We've been good lately.  The homo stuff is, you know.  Let's bring it back.  No, we've been good lately.  Let's keep it where it's been. 
[00:31:30]  I miss it the last few months.  Keep it where it's been in the bathrooms during commercials.  That's right.  We've been doing it with our drills and our knee pads.  Fruits.  I was bringing up earlier, I had a smile on my face through all the adversity that we  were going through because, Opie, Steven Seagal.  His show started last night?  Has a TV show.  Yeah.  And before his TV show, I watched an entire biography. 
[00:32:00]  You know the show Biography?  Sure.  Done on Steven Seagal.  That had to be a snooze fest.  First, I got to say, this guy is master Poe that got recognized.  I swear to you.  Same guy.  It is.  It might be a little too inside, but I like that.  But it is hysterical.  This guy.  Did you ever get into Steven Seagal?  No.  I was never a fan of Steven Seagal.  Well, name one movie that I was... 
[00:32:30]  All right.  You know what wasn't a bad movie was that one where he was the cook on the ship.  Under Siege.  Under Siege.  Oh, Under Siege.  Yeah.  You know what?  Under Siege was a pretty good one.  You're right.  Had a budget.  You're right.  Had some stars in it.  It was kind of cool and shit like that.  You're right.  That was a good one.  Um, Judah Freelander was on the biography show.  Why?  He is a motherfucking Steven Seagal fan.  Yeah, he loves him.  Dude, he knew everything about him. 
[00:33:00]  Judah Freelander loves him.  Yes, I was laughing my ass off because it's like, Judah, just talking about it like, like,  and the direct-to-video movies, I watched them whenever I could see one, a movie on.  I mean, this guy's a genius.  Was he kind of...  No, he was...  Was he faking it?  Deadly serious.  Really?  His love of Steven Seagal.  But I think he knows Seagal's things.  He has to know his things.  Yeah, it was...  You could tell he knows, but it's like, it's like, uh, you know, the movie Roadhouse. 
[00:33:30]  Stinks on ice, but you would watch it.  Sure.  You know, just for the goof factor, Steven Seagal, it's the same thing.  And they went through, uh, they were showing pictures of him when he was a kid, and, and,  uh, when he first got into his martial arts, and, uh, and then they were  then he apparently, 20 years ago, uh, was a deputy sheriff.  They, uh, kind of, uh, he was teaching, he was teaching this, uh, uh, place down in, 
[00:34:00]  in Louisiana, one of their, one of their parishes or something, teaching them martial arts to  help them out there in the field.  Sure, sure, sure.  And the, uh, the head muckety-muck down there said, hey, you know, why don't you join?  You know, you're a good guy, a big guy, you know what you're doing.  So, uh, he joined, and he was deputy sheriff for 20 years.  So we fast forward, and we get the TV show.  So now after all this shit with, uh, you know, his movies going kind of down the crapper  and everything, uh, he decides this is going to be a reality show.  So, uh, I was watching it, and, uh, the pomposity of Steven Seagal is, is unsurpassed. 
[00:34:30]  He's, he's, uh, he's talking to, uh, the room full of officers.  We should have clips of this.  Yeah, we could get clips.  This show will be on.  All right.  Believe me.  The boys down the hall, if you get a couple clips of the show.  It debuted last night?  Or the night before.  Whatever it was.  I saw it last night.  All right.  And, uh, he is talking to the guys saying, you know, hey, hey, look, don't look at me  like I'm a big movie star. 
[00:35:00]  Look at me like I'm one, someone who can save your life.  He's not a big movie star.  The best part was like, some of the cops are looking like, don't look at you like you're  a big movie star.  I didn't for a second.  He might have been a big movie star for two years.  Yeah, yeah.  For a couple of years.  A couple of years, maybe.  He had some hit movies, you know, he was competing with, I think, Van Damme there for a while.  I don't think anyone would confuse him for a big movie star in the year 2009.  He's a very iconic figure. 
[00:35:30]  He's a weird, uh, but he's not a relevant movie star at all.  But no one says movie star, by the way.  It's not 1955.  Movie star.  Movie star.  Exactly.  Don't look at me like I'm the star of stage and screen.  And in the biography, they do cover, um, uh, some sides, uh, that I think would surprise  you up.  Uh, you know, there's a musical side to Steven Seagal.  He put out an album.  No, he didn't.  Where is it?  Yes.  Where he wrote the song.  Get me a song.  He plays guitar.  It's called me. 
[00:36:00]  It's called Steven Seagal songs from the crystal cave.  That's photoshopped.  He didn't release a photo of himself dramatically staring over the neck of a guitar.  Yes, he is holding the guitar, and he is dramatically staring over the neck of the guitar as he's,  as he's holding a chord.  And, um, it is.  Get me a song.  God awful.  We got one?  No, we could not possibly have some Steven Seagal. 
[00:36:30]  Funny, they didn't have certain Beatles songs off the first album, but they have this.  Yeah, really.  Let's take a listen.  Now, some black guy's, uh, singing for a little bit, but then Steven Seagal comes in.  And if this is that song, I don't know.  Or maybe he starts right off with it.  All different genres, he said, were included.  None are good.  They told him, don't mix up the genres.  And he said, I'm doing what I want, because I'm Steven Seagal.  Movie star.  Is that him?  Yeah.  He said all the right words that I needed to say. 
[00:37:00]  That's got a Chris Christopherson quality.  It's not.  You know what?  I want to beat it up, but he can't.  That's a dude of Freelander's set.  I wouldn't.  Freelander's set, the same thing.  I wouldn't be downloading this anytime soon, but we've heard movie stars singing a lot worse than this.  He said he was hoping it was worse than it was.  Yeah, I can't beat this up.  But it's just, see, there's a musical side.  That you don't know about. 
[00:37:30]  This is fucking terrible.  It's not.  It's fucking toneless.  It's milk toast.  It's not even, it's in the category of just there.  It is.  It's just there.  It's laying there.  It's just laying there.  Yeah.  It's laying there.  And a lot of vocals over him and stuff.  And then there was a part where they were talking about how he's very charitable.  He tries to keep, to maintain this tough guy attitude, Opie.  Let me tell you, he's doing charity work with small children in Thailand, where they show... 
[00:38:00]  Fucking Steven Seagal found a loophole.  God bless you, brother.  He'll kick your ass you mentioned that because...  I just said a loophole.  They showed him going to this orphanage in Thailand where these children have been abused in many, many different ways.  Right.  And one person who was very happy because Steven Seagal did fund a lot of this and make it possible in Thailand to bring these children together into one spot. 
[00:38:30]  And a person that was very happy for the contribution was the Catholic priest that ran the place.  I was horrified when I saw this guy pop his fucking head into the scene.  It's like Voss running a casino.  Dude, when I saw that, I was like...  A Catholic priest?  Oh my God, yes.  There's a priest just talking.  He could not talk any better about Jesus. 
[00:39:00]  He was talking about Steven Seagal like he was Jesus.  Delivering fucking...  It's like cheeseburgers to Steve C.  It would be like Keith the Cobb instead of gathering homeless guys today.  Yes.  Gathering up high school girls and dropping them off at your compound for the weekend.  At my house.  Exactly.  Correctamundo.  Give myself a bell.  Thank you.  Exactly.  I got to watch this thing now.  I had no desire to watch the biography of Steven Seagal, but now I have to watch. 
[00:39:30]  I couldn't get enough of Steven Seagal.  And then last night, watching his crime fighting...  Terrific, right?  They show him sitting in the passenger seat.  Guy's driving, another guy's driving.  Is he recognizable as Steven Seagal?  Oh, yeah.  Because some of these guys, you know...  No, he's Steven Seagal.  He's got the perpetual fucking...  The eyebrows going down like he's mad all the time.  Yeah.  He's got the ponytail.  Yeah.  And he's in full regalia, you know, because he's a deputy sheriff.  And he drives around with this guy, and he was talking about how he has a sixth sense. 
[00:40:00]  Yes.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's Steven Seagal.  And he drives around and goes, I look at things.  They have like a voiceover.  He goes, I look at things.  I look at hands.  I look at faces.  What's his sixth sense?  You learn over...  He knows if he's driving by a couple of people.  Is it sixth sense that he detects...  Oh, fuck.  Oh, oh, oh, B.  Where's Tiger Woods' mom? 
[00:40:30]  All right.  What happened?  That is Tiger Woods' mom.  We'll get into that a little later.  I was going to say it detects douche chills.  It would have kind of worked, but I stammered through it.  He said he could detect, like, people, their mannerisms, facial expressions.  When he drives past and sees two people on a corner, he knows if there's shenanigans going on.  Yeah.  You know.  He drives around at night, right?  Maybe.  So if you're driving around at night and you see people just hanging out on a corner, most times they're up to no good. 
[00:41:00]  I think that might be him talking about how he's a movie star.  Could you back that up a little bit, and let's get Steven Seagal talking.  He's addressing the rest of the guy in Jefferson.  What is it?  Jefferson Parish or something like that?  Yeah.  Sheriff's Office.  He's addressing some of them.  Back at the training academy, there's some of them teaching some of the new recruits.  Hopefully, some of the things I'll teach them to keep them safe and save their lives.  Some of you know me.  Some of you don't. 
[00:41:30]  I've been doing martial arts for over 40 years.  So you can look at me at a movie star.  Say, hey, man, Steven Seagal here.  He's a movie star.  Or you can wipe that out of your head and say, Steven Seagal can save my life.  Because that's why I'm here.  Weapons retention.  Oh, my God.  I've got to watch this show.  He's an ass.  Not one recruit looked at him like, no.  No.  No.  Sorry.  We weren't thinking that at all there, Steven.  It is the best show on television right now.  I am giving it best show on television. 
[00:42:00]  James R. in Jersey, he gives us a clip.  He says, starting at 326, he says he has superpowers.  Did he talk about his superpowers?  I think that's part of his superpowers, where he talks about how he can just fucking look at people, dude, and he knows.  Okay.  So it's superpowers.  He knows.  Not a success.  I have those same superpowers.  I could look at people and know if they're committing crimes or innocent or guilty.  Dude, I've been talking about my superpowers on the air for years.  I have those same superpowers. 
[00:42:30]  Don't bullshit me, Steven Seagal.  I know what you're using.  Damn, I've got to start DVRing this show.  Lawman.  Oh, Steven Seagal, lawman.  And his biography with Judah talking about it.  I would love to talk to Judah a little bit about that.  Well, now we have something to talk to Judah about.  I know.  We love Judah.  It's fantastic.  He's becoming a big star with that 30 Rock.  Big star.  And they had another guy.  It slips my mind who he was.  But another big Steven Seagal fan.  And they know the movies. 
[00:43:00]  They know Judah's going off about parts of the movies.  Co-stars.  How he was acting.  Do you know Steven Seagal's original sensei?  Was a little angry with Steven Seagal.  Because he was using the type of martial arts that he used at the beginning.  Was accurate.  And then toward the end of his big movie career, he started bastardizing that technique a little.  And the sensei was a little worried that people would look and go, that's not really Aga Maka Tusha. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, he was freestyling?  Meanwhile, no one knows.  He was freestyling for the movie.  Freestyling a little bit.  No one would know what type of martial arts he was fucking using when he's chopping someone's hand off with a machete.  Unbelievable.  It's fantastic.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Let me say hi to Sean in Georgia.  A lot of people saw the law man last night.  Law man.  Sean, what do you got?  At one point, they're chasing a guy.  And they lose a fellow officer on radio contact. 
[00:44:00]  And Steven Seagal goes, oh, God, we've watched Johnny on radio.  We need to find him quick.  In which he proceeds to walk briskly looking for him.  Walk briskly.  Steven Seagal is really fat.  He's really not in shape is what it is.  Incredibly fat.  He should use some of those karate moves to keep the food out of his mouth.  Whipping away.  He should be whipping away the buffet. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, my God.  What is that?  It's the Master Poe Star Wars Kid video on YouTube.  It's one of our favorites.  I have got to put that in Adobe After Effects and put a lightsaber effect on it.  Oh, people have done that, yes.  Yeah.  That is the Master Poe.  He's in the hallway with a sword, waving it around.  And it is nothing but fantastic.  You know, I do miss Master Poe.  If you're out there, I say hi to Master Poe today.  I say us.  I miss Poe as well.  There he is with the lightsaber.  Somebody actually did.  Oh, by the way, as the guy down the hall is all pissed at me right now, look at this. 
[00:45:00]  Foundrymusic.com.  This was not brought to you by foundrymusic.com.  Oh, it says this was not brought to you by foundrymusic.com.  What is that about?  Maybe one of the fans did it as a goof.  Maybe.  No, it's got the logo on it.  Where was the O.P. & Anthony logo on that?  Why have one?  Why the f...  Because it's Master Poe.  Why would it...  That might...  You should find out.  Maybe he didn't do that.  I don't want to talk to him.  I'll have a professional relationship.  I'll say yes, no, thank you, and that's it.  I don't know what that is. 
[00:45:30]  But Steven Seagal, very out of shape.  And that took advantage of us.  Another one.  Fucked!  Sorry.  No, no.  Steven Seagal.  Steven Seagal, very out of shape.  So, yeah, he walks briskly when he tries to apprehend somebody.  A brisk walk is what Steven Seagal...  Does he have to, like, keep wiping his brow?  He's sweating all the time.  Is he really?  That brow that's just, like, always...  You know he has swamp ass as he's...  Oh, God, sitting in that fucking patrol car all night long. 
[00:46:00]  Walking.  Oh, but it's great.  His...  He is so pompous.  And then he talks about his martial arts and how it's affected him.  He's a Buddhist.  Yes, he is.  And so he's constantly putting his hands together and meditating a little bit.  Yes, he is.  During, you know...  For the people that don't know Master Poe that well, you do a YouTube search and just  put in Master Poe.  Oh, dude.  You'll have some enjoyment today.  There is so much...  So much Master Poe video. 
[00:46:30]  Master Poe's body rock.  Master Poe body rock.  It is...  It is fabulous.  I fucking love this guy.  Is that at a mall or something?  My favorite is when he was dancing on Bourbon Street as we're trying to do a broadcast.  Oh, yeah.  And we got lunatics that are throwing beads at us.  And the whole reason he was there was to protect us.  And he's too busy dancing with all the broads on Bourbon Street.  What happened?  Not that I don't...  I understand, obviously.  But Jesus, Master Poe.  It's fantastic. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  So, Lawman.  Lawman.  Yeah.  Check it out.  If you don't get douche chills in the first five minutes, I'll change the channel.  Does he talk black when he's in front of black people?  Is someone going to say?  It seemed like he was a little bit there.  Steven Seagal saved my life.  Saved my life.  Oh, we got a deputy in...  A deputy in New Orleans.  Oh, yeah?  Brad.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Brad.  Fuck those saints, by the way.  Fuck them.  Hey, sorry, man. 
[00:47:30]  I'm at work right now.  Look here.  Let me tell you something.  Whatever.  That motherfucker Steven Seagal is bullshit.  Yeah.  Got out.  It's an honorary deputy that he is.  He's not a commission deputy.  That motherfucker got there from the sheriff in a parade 20 years ago.  So he's an honorary...  Now, how can he carry a weapon and whatnot?  Because they gave him a...  In the state of Louisiana, if you get a commission from a sheriff, they allow you to carry a gun 
[00:48:00]  if you take the qualification test.  Uh-huh.  He's a lawman!  He went and took the test, and it took him three times to get the damn qualification.  Really?  Damn.  So now, what do you guys...  Have you seen the show?  We were laughing at him.  Come on.  It's Steven Seagal lawman.  Sir, I don't like the fact that you're bad-mouthing this lawman.  Exactly.  He's a lawman.  Hey, that piece of shit in Jefferson Parish. 
[00:48:30]  All he did was...  He does all this shit about...  He is deputy in Jefferson Parish.  The deputies of Jefferson Parish are laughing at his ass.  If you notice, he didn't even ride at all.  It was a marked unit.  He was riding around in a rake.  A rake deputy.  That's a deputy who don't even see the sunlight most of the time.  They always get the damn office.  Really?  Let me tell you.  He dead in the mother's...  And then he did that shit in the summertime.  He couldn't even do it in the last couple of weeks. 
[00:49:00]  Because that area he's at has been demolished and torn down.  God damn it.  I tell you...  I got...  I got something else I want to say right now.  What?  I always knew Notorious B.I.G. was still living.  Oh, man.  And he is in New Orleans.  And he's working as a deputy.  Yeah, yo.  Biggie Smalls is alive and well in New Orleans.  Man, why don't y'all come down here to New Orleans for more?  And we get a couple of girls who get naked.  Especially them girls in the Catholic school. 
[00:49:30]  They were the like you, Ann.  We did go to New Orleans.  And we watched a crowd of black kids just punching white people in the street.  It was fantastic.  Look, you know...  You know, Brad, I like to have a little bit of an open mind when it comes to that type of thing that Ann talks about.  But I have to back them up on this one.  We were on a balcony.  And these...  And these youths were just punching white people in the face.  As they walked by.  Over and over again.  They'd squeeze the...  The guy's...  The guy's... 
[00:50:00]  Chick's tit.  And then when the guy turned around and said something...  Cold cocked.  Bam!  Right in the fucking face.  There was no lawman to protect them.  Where was lawman?  And then Jimmy and I...  The lawman was probably playing for his uniform, which you guys should have been...  Who's with me with the Warriors B.I.G. thing with this guy?  Yeah, it's a little bit.  Holy shit.  They wound up getting the group after a while.  What you guys need to do is, when you come down to New Orleans this time, go in the Bourbon Street,  and go on the first quarter and enjoy yourself. 
[00:50:30]  And then when the parade starts, get your asses up on the balcony and stay on the balcony.  That's exactly what we did, dude.  It was great.  We had a good time.  We did.  Yeah, we did two or three of those.  We had a great time.  Went to the strip clubs, man.  Got handies, whatever.  New jobs.  And all the good deeds.  Before the parade, you catch the girls going up and down the street.  Get to see more tickets and a mammogram.  Nice.  Did a mammogram.  I hear you.  By the way... 
[00:51:00]  How does he not get a car crash for that one?  I know.  It's because we're scared of the black man.  Yeah, okay, Jimmy.  That's all right.  That's all right, mister.  All right, Brad.  Thank you.  Good call, brother.  All right.  Go ahead.  Continue looting stores.  Oh, come on.  That's not true.  Deputies.  That's what I'm talking about.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  That was a police juggle.  Yeah.  All right.  Good point.  Good point.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Brad.  Take it easy, Brad.  Uh, my son is, uh...  Can you play...  Can I have my TV back, Brad?  He, uh...  That's fine.  Because no... 
[00:51:30]  Uh, Zumba.  All right.  One more, and then we got to move on.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Lance in Louisiana.  Lance.  Good morning.  Bye-bye.  Hey.  Hey, Lance.  How classic was when he had those circle sunglasses on, teaching those guys how to shoot  or whatever, defend themselves.  He looked like Prince.  Yeah.  And also, he called...  This one guy had problems putting the handcuffs on.  Yeah.  And he called him.  He said, how does that feel, brother? 
[00:52:00]  Brother?  Brother?  The guy kicked the wind out, and then they pulled out the tazer gun immediately and tased  him.  It was probably the best TV I've ever seen.  It was, uh, yeah, it really is entertaining to watch, uh, uh, a C-list actor, uh, try to  be a lawman like that.  It's, it's, it's hysterical.  I have a question for Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Ooh.  Jimmy, I mean, how great was it that you stood up to this big mongole, uh, Jeffy Venture?  On the video, why was his head shaking so much? 
[00:52:30]  Did he have Tourette's?  I don't think he has Tourette's.  He, uh, it was just an argument.  I mean, it was like, I don't even look at, like, standing up like we were in an alley  ready to fist fight.  What happened was, I could, I could jump in here for a second.  Every time Jesse got upset or frustrated because he couldn't express himself, that's when the  head started moving.  He shakes, though, in every, uh, interview.  I think he's got something.  But he rocks a little more when he's, when he's, when he's frustrated.  He's a bobblehead person.  He, he, he, he, we love you guys in Louisiana, but New Orleans, that's a pissing. 
[00:53:00]  Thanks, man.  Have a good day, guys.  Hey, wait, do you think your Saints are going undefeated?  I need to know.  I think he hung up.  Fuck.  You see the Jet game last night?  Mm-hmm.  I took, I took, I took, I took, they do.  I heard the sliding class didn't go very well.  Well, they won.  For Sanchez, huh?  Yeah, they won.  It's the Bills, Jets, their season, holding on by a thread, basically.  Yeah.  And Sanchez, yeah, he had sliding lessons with Joe Girardi, and, uh, well, he, he hurt his  knee, sort of sliding last night, so. 
[00:53:30]  Sort of.  Sliding head first or something.  Yeah, it was a weird little fucking thing that went down and he's got a sprain or something.  He'll be all right.  He'll probably play in there next game.  You think?  He's all right?  He's all right.  He'll be fine.  I was more into my Islanders last night.  I'd rather watch hockey than football at this point.  Hockey.  As far as my team goes.  Yeah, fucking Molson had a hat trick last night.  Oh, yeah?  Tell me about this Molson guy on the Islanders.  Molson.  My favorite hat trick was in an, I sat in an elevator, a gentleman with an older woman. 
[00:54:00]  It was called the Remove It Ta-Da.  Yep.  Hey, uh, speaking of Jesse, you saw the Jesse show?  The Conspiracy Show, Jimmy, you were saying?  Conspiracy.  Mind Control.  I only saw the last 20 minutes of it, but, uh, it wasn't bad.  You liked it?  Yeah, I mean, you know, it'd be fun to dump on it, but, uh, you know, it was pretty good.  I think it was overly dramatic.  A little bit, but.  You get, and you got some, um, assisted reality as far as the, uh, some of the shots went. 
[00:54:30]  You know, they kind of made it, tried to make it look a little more ominous through the video.  Well, the musical.  It really was, and the music and everything, so, but, you know, everyone's doing that.  And he's like, hey, they put the, the, the music up to my neck, and I knew I was listening  to the Goo Goo Dolls.  Right.  But it was still, uh, it was pretty good.  All right.  I get angry.  When I'm denied, I get angry.  Shut it.  Annoying.  He said that, because, you know, they wouldn't let him in or some shit. 
[00:55:00]  Somebody tweeted the funniest thing about, about the, I want me to just reread this.  Somebody's fucking tweet about it.  It was not very complimentary.  Tweet.  About the show.  No, no, no, about me.  It was funny.  I don't see how anybody could knock me.  Well, you're going to get, you're going to get some haters through that video, Jimmy.  I don't even think this guy is a.  Fuck him.  Fuck him in the ass.  It's good exposure all the way around.  Fuck the haters, man.  What did he say?  Jesse walked out because he was frustrated.  To Jesse, you were a woman too small to, uh, punch and too mouthy to outtalk. 
[00:55:30]  Which, you know, was pretty funny.  You know, the guy said too, I edited it because he wrote, you were a woman too small to get  punched.  Sir, please.  Please.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll do a little Tiger Woods action.  There's a couple things.  What's happening with him?  I don't know.  Something about our problem.  Well, the best part is this.  What happened?  That's his mother.  That's his mom.  We learned, uh, last night.  What happened?  Tiger's mom was in the house the whole time, ran down the street to see what happened.  What happened?  And one of the papers in New York, uh, uh, has all the Tiger Woods, uh, jokes in it. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, really?  So, Jimmy, I mean, you're a comedian.  I want to see if you, if you enjoy the Tiger Woods jokes.  Put your own comedic, uh, timing and spin on it.  And thank you, by the way, the Daily News for fixing that quote.  They did that today.  They did?  Yes, they did.  So, thank you.  Funny.  Um.  I'm surprised they did it.  Yeah.  What, uh, what papers did not look at on the break?  I don't know.  They're all the same to me, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  They're all, you know, worthless.  Oh, my God.  Don't talk about the, uh.  Papers are worth.  No, no, no, no.  Newspapers.  Oh, shit. 
[00:56:30]  Wow.  I was just ready to say, oh, good.  Thank you for bailing me out of that one.  Papers are worthless.  Papers.  Dude, by the time I read the newspaper in the morning, for real.  Yeah.  They're so fucking far behind.  You know everything already.  They're so far behind.  Yeah.  It's like the old days with, uh, with, uh, the news.  You know, you used to get clips from, like, Vietnam.  When I was a kid growing up, remember, like, you get clips from Vietnam the next day.  You don't remember that as a child? 
[00:57:00]  I do.  I was a small child.  I was very, uh, involved in politics as a child.  Oh, we fucking missed our bit.  I was a little kid.  I swear.  We were doing our, we were doing our Walter Cronkite bit.  We missed out on that.  Bom, bom, bom.  No, well, Bill O'Reilly, this fucking, blech.  Uh, he, he, he, he has so much Bill O'Reilly, Bill O'Reilly merchandise.  Merch.  That he wants his viewers to, to buy.  Yeah, it's a lot of merchandise on his, uh, website.  It's completely out of hand, and then if you're, like, a, a premium member of his fucking 
[00:57:30]  lick my ass club.  Yeah.  You get other stuff or something.  Yeah, you gotta be a premium member.  And I go to Anthony, I'm like, can you imagine Walter Cronkite after giving us the hard news  all of a sudden, you know, hawking some fucking Walter Cronkite merchandise?  Go to WalterCronkite.com.  Send away from my Walter Cronkite glasses.  During sad times, you could take them down halfway and dab your eyes.  That'd be great.  What the fuck happened to the news?  Walter Cronkite. 
[00:58:00]  Because they, they, they present it like it's the news.  Yes.  I hope most people understand.  It's just, it's entertainment like this show is.  Send now for the War is Unwinnable t-shirt.  Right.  Yeah.  Papers are for old people.  Timic, uh, says from Oshkosh.  Old people?  Oh, that sounds very ageist to me.  Yes, yes.  I don't know where's time to read like the Sunday New York Times.  It's people that want to know the news.  It weighs 10 pounds. 
[00:58:30]  They sit and go, what happened?  And then they get, here's a newspaper, you'll beg.  All right, we'll get into the Tiger Woods updates.  Uh, we got Rich Voss coming by.  We got, uh, Bobo coming by, but I don't think he'll make the show.  He's here every Friday and some days we, we have him in, other days we don't.  And, uh, hopefully some, um, homeless people for the homeless shopping spree, which is less  than two weeks away.  Two weeks from yesterday, December 17th, it goes down.  We want a lot of people to join us as, uh, these guys shop in a mall just outside of New  York City, somewhere in Jersey. 
[00:59:00]  We'll, we'll announce the mall sooner than later, but, uh, you can follow what's going  on with the homeless shopping spree on Twitter.  Go to O-A-H-S-S.  That's a Twitter account.  Have we had any bums in, uh, the studio?  No.  Aside from, you know, our executive producer.  I'm talking about, like, uh, homeless people.  No, even that's a problem around here.  Yeah, with security.  They have to go up the freight elevator.  It's a whole thing.  I actually like that, dude.  I'm just talking because...  They should be putting the freight elevator.  It is funny.  They have to be putting the freight elevator.  Like freight. 
[00:59:30]  Ha ha ha.  You're not a person.  Exactly.  Hey, baggage, get in there.  And right up there with the fucking, with the box of carbuncles.  Come on.  I don't know what a carbuncle is.  Carbuncle.  What's a carbuncle?  I don't know.  I just love the word.  We got a box of carbuncles and two homeless people.  Could you Google carbuncle?  Carbuncle.  I think it's a...  Like, isn't it a wound or something?  Yeah, it's like a boil or something terrible.  Oh, I was perfectly right then. 
[01:00:00]  Carbuncle.  There you go.  It's an infection that people get from, like, certain things.  Oh, God damn it.  I'm going to eat.  Please take that off the screen.  Oh, my God.  But I'm just talking about, like, the limited space we have in here, it's going to stink  up real fast.  So?  Real fast.  No, I'm just saying, I'm going to eat.  We're all right.  I'm going to eat very quickly.  We can handle that.  No, we can't.  I hate the homeless and their stench.  Do you don't like being around them?  I hate being around the homeless.  They're despicable, awful, smelly people. 
[01:00:30]  And I don't like them.  All right.  We're going to break.  I'm going to eat.  Tiger Woods is unhappy with one of his body parts.  We'll explain that.  Really?  They're killing all this shit.  They're killing this guy.  Holy shit.  Fucking media is despicable.  They really are reprehensible.  They are killing this guy.  Reprehensible.  Ah, fuck him.  Fuck him in the ass.  Tiger?  Yeah.  Love to.  Yeah.  Not even a gaith.  They just had respect. 
[01:01:00]  God damn, you're good.  Blurk him, blurk him.  Blurk.  Are you looking for the perfect holiday gifts for your family?  On the first day of Christmas, someone said to me, I'd like this for my tree.  Come on down to the Ted Sheckler Happy Holiday Mega Fantastic Christmas Trinkets Emporium.  It's fantasia for holiday fun.  If Ted Sheckler doesn't stock it, he'll find you a suitable substitute.  I don't have any pear trees.  I had a bush.  And if Ted Sheckler doesn't know what you're talking about, he'll make his best guess at what your family member might enjoy. 
[01:01:30]  I don't know what a turtle love is.  It sounds like a cross-reading.  From the obscure.  I got Minutemains a-milking.  That's milk in a Minutemain container.  To the traditional gold ring.  I do have that.  Well, almost.  Well, actually, they're not gold.  They're black cock rings that I've spray-painted in gold.  The Ted Sheckler Happy Holiday Mega Fantastic Christmas Trinkets Emporium carries lots of things.  I have that.  You can get whatever you need.  Opie and Anthony, Friday. 
[01:02:00]  Yes.  I like to say, thank God it's Friday.  Yeah.  Rich Voss is going to be in studio in another 15 or 20 minutes.  And I'm hearing that there's homeless guys here.  Oh, really?  They're here?  Yeah.  It's a process to get them upstairs.  But that is happening as we speak.  We should have them in here in a few minutes.  Homeless shopping spree.  What?  Two weeks away.  Less than two weeks in. 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  And we're going to blow this one out.  I'm telling you.  Yeah?  We'll show this company what this show is all about because for some reason they don't really  understand that yet.  I want to see a shitload of people there.  Yeah.  And people with loads of shit in their pants.  Of course.  Would be the...  And once again, I want to remind you to follow what's going on with the homeless shopping spree.  We set up a Twitter account, O-A-H-S-S.  And, you know, when we interview these homeless people today, we'll take some video, we'll take  some pictures, and it'll be right up on that Twitter account for you. 
[01:03:00]  We'll get to meet some new homeless people.  This is exciting.  The new crop of homeless people.  Yeah, the new crop.  I mean, we obviously grew very attached to some of the old homeless, but I think meeting  some new homeless will be exciting.  Yeah, it's going to be all right.  It's like replacing Darren on Bewitched.  You know, we had our Tippy Tom.  He was the big star.  Everybody loved him.  You can't replace Tippy Tom.  But you know something? 
[01:03:30]  Everyone thought Dick York could not be replaced either, and then they brought in Dick Sargent.  You liked the new Darren Stevens?  I hated him.  So what are you talking about?  The fucking show kept going.  That's a good point.  Kept going.  Good point.  They knew.  Whoa, whoa.  Ah, we're dating ourselves, but as a kid, did you even know they switched out to Darren's?  I didn't.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I didn't.  I was dumb.  But it was a weird knowing.  Like you knew, but you didn't know why or that it mattered.  Really?  It was just like, oh, what are they doing here?  I didn't even notice. 
[01:04:00]  I didn't even notice.  Apparently, Dick fucking York's lungs were like rolling paper at that point.  He couldn't even breathe.  Yeah.  And they had to bring in the new Darren.  Right.  This fucking fat slob that was on the plane.  We tweeted that picture yesterday.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everyone is talking about the fat slob on the plane.  I mean, you just should not be this big.  Who is the guy?  And how embarrassed is he that he's the fat slob on the plane?  The picture's in the paper again today.  And the guy, he's in half his seat, and his entire left cheek is in the aisle of this particular plane. 
[01:04:30]  And now the article today is, should this man be able to fly on a plane?  No.  No.  Well, if you can buy two seats.  But sometimes, and it looks like that's the type of plane that doesn't have that middle part that comes up.  I mean, you buy two seats, so what do you do?  You sit in.  Well, no, you've got to figure out the airlines that have that thing where you could lift up the middle bar and sit in two seats. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, well, that's discrimination.  What, the planes?  Then it's like handicapped ramps.  You've got to make the planes and equip them with an armrest in the middle that can lift up so some fat ass can use both seats.  Honestly, it's not even the fat guy's problem.  This is what should happen.  If you have to sit next to a fat guy like this, where now you're kind of not in your seat properly, because you're kind of moving to the right, because part of his body's in your seat, then the airline should give you a major discount on your seat. 
[01:05:30]  You won't get that.  Of course not.  It never works in the favor of the customer.  They moved the other guy to a later flight, the skinnier guy.  Something.  Yeah.  And again.  They did move him to another flight.  That is.  But this fat guy is sitting next to somebody.  No, no, I know.  But they might have, before they took off, moved him.  That is a ridiculous safety hazard, by the way.  I said it yesterday.  They would crucify you if you had a carry-on bag next to your seat.  Right. 
[01:06:00]  Because it would take up the aisle.  What they did, I believe, was they.  He actually had his.  This is what they did with this guy.  Was they moved the guy next to him to a later flight, and they put the fat fuck in the middle seat and gave him the seatbelt extension.  How did they put him in the middle seat?  Well, here's the problem with the fat guy.  You know, if there's an issue with this plane, everybody's fucked.  How are you getting around this guy?  Yeah, that's another thing.  He was in the middle seat.  He wasn't hanging.  The plane did not take off, apparently.  No, I mean, like, what happens?  It couldn't take off.  What would happen in a case of an emergency where he now is in the aisle, not moving very briskly, and you're behind him? 
[01:06:30]  I wouldn't fucking do it.  This guy has to be, like, the furthest away from an exit.  He has to be the last guy out of the plane.  No, because if the plane will be doing a wheelie the whole time.  Wheelie?  Take that, slob.  We love Jim.  You're mad today, aren't you?  I can tell.  It's in the air today.  Not even mad.  It's just frustrating. 
[01:07:00]  Just disgusted.  It's just fucking frustrating, man.  Anyway, Tiger Woods.  Ah, yeah.  Jimmy, there's some great Tiger Woods jokes in the paper today.  Where are they?  I didn't see them in one of the papers.  I bet they're golf-related.  No.  Well, let's go through these jokes.  There's five of them.  One, two, three, four, six of them.  And let's rate the joke.  I don't know where they are.  Let's rate the joke.  Page six in that horse shit of a paper.  No, I haven't forgot.  All right, we got the... 
[01:07:30]  Okay.  Yeah, we'll get them in.  They look too normal.  They really do.  They look like radio guys we used to work with.  I don't know.  That's Keith.  Hello, sir.  Here are the jokes.  What do Tiger Woods and Baby Seals have in common?  Um, um, they both enjoy laying in the snow outdoors.  That's not it.  Uh, what, what is it?  Both are clubbed by Scandinavians. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, okay.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  It's a baby seal joke.  Scandinavian, baby seal clubbing joke.  Do you give that one a passing grade, Jimmy?  Yeah.  As a comedian?  All right.  Our tits are giant today.  What is she wearing?  That...  Jill's tits are huge today.  Wow, she's not holding back today.  I think she's...  What's going on?  She's jealous because we've been paying attention to the other girl.  Because we've been, uh, the fucking...  And I told Anthony during the break, because now people are tweeting me and saying,  what's the big deal with this weather girl? 
[01:08:30]  I'll tell you what happened with the weather girl.  We started noticing how big and juicy her tits are.  We're calling them big and heavies, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The last two days, after all the attention we gave this brood, she is strapping those  puppies down big time.  Yeah, what the fuck?  She's wearing black, which is not flattering if you have a shape to your body.  Mm-hmm.  And they're pushed way down.  One guy goes, she doesn't even have big, big boobies.  You think they told her to strap those fuckers down?  They probably don't want her to be known just as a sex symbol. 
[01:09:00]  She probably takes her weather thing real seriously.  Oh, does she?  Is she a meteorologist?  Shut up, please.  Any fucking sixth grader can figure out the weather online these days.  Of course.  All right, back to the Tiger Woods jokes.  Apparently, the police asked Tiger's wife how many times she hit him.  She said, I don't know exactly, but put me down for a five.  Ah!  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Boo!  That's funny.  See, because people cheat at golf.  Yeah, they go, ah, put me down for a five. 
[01:09:30]  That's good.  I'm liking it.  Rich Voss had a fine Tiger Woods joke.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, he probably had the best joke.  Where is it?  Nah.  Uh, where is it?  Did you hear the one?  Actually, Rich Voss is here.  We'll have him tell his Tiger Woods joke in a second or two here.  Oh, good.  It's probably the best one I've heard.  Right from the horse's ass.  Here's the next one.  What's the difference between a Cadillac and a golf ball? 
[01:10:00]  Um, uh, the Cadillac is much larger and heavier.  Oh, literal joke, Jim.  Fucking hate you today.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm helping with the jokes.  He's very good.  The answer, Tiger could drive a golf ball 400 yards.  You know, people put some thought to these.  That's kind of...  These are the best jokes.  I thought mine was better.  No, yours made, like, sense. 
[01:10:30]  This one...  It wasn't humorous.  It was.  It was.  This one is a big-time stretch.  The next one is,  we now see that Tiger drives very well on the fairway,  but doesn't fare very well on the driveway.  A clever use of words.  I...  Not funny, but...  Hmm.  That's not the way to...  They should have said,  Tiger sure can hit the ball far,  but far is not how good he drives his truck.  These are all good jokes, folks. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, thank you, Squarehead.  Squarehead.  Voss tweeted that Tiger should have used a driver.  Ah, that's a good one.  I got one that I haven't heard or read in the paper yet.  What would you call Tiger Woods if he was an astronaut?  Oh, shit.  What are all Ellen's friends saying?  We told you not to marry a tiger.  Oh, shit.  We're now calling him Cheetah Woods? 
[01:11:30]  It's like another cat.  Oh, cheetah.  Because he's cheating.  Oh, cheetah Woods.  I get it.  That one's all over the place, too.  What do the Ryder Cup and Tiger's House have in common?  Um, this is an inside golf joke, big time.  Oh, really?  This is inside.  The Ryder Cup and the Tiger's Household,  they're both places where Tiger gets beat by Europeans.  Oh, okay. 
[01:12:00]  Because the Ryder Cup is the Americans versus the Europeans.  Anything on there about Velcro on the ceiling?  Oh, shit.  No?  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  An empty boat.  Aye, nigh.  An empty boat.  How about 12 if you slice them thin enough?  Night.  The warden.  And stick him to the window. 
[01:12:30]  Will the defendant please rise?  Sir.  Sir.  Oh, wow.  And finally, how do you say Tiger's wife's name?  To keep the pigeons from shitting on their lips.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  We're getting a few other punchlines here.  Fertilizer.  And something about, oh, stop. 
[01:13:00]  I can't say that.  That's the whole joke, dummy.  Oh, this is good.  Guys.  Inflate.  Inflate to 10 pounds.  All right.  Jesus.  I always liked that one.  Nothing like that.  All right.  Let me go to Jared in Louisiana.  He's got one.  Jared.  Hey, boys.  Hey, man. 
[01:13:30]  Come on.  Why Tiger hit a fire hydrant and a tree?  Wait, say that again.  Why?  Because he couldn't choose between an iron or a wood.  Oh, see, because fire hydrants are made of iron and trees are made of wood.  Oh, because weapon of iron and wood.  He tried to hit Charlene, sir.  Very clever.  They keep their knuckles scraping when they walk. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  Jesus.  They were bowling balls.  Wow.  Guilty.  All right.  Turn off the answer of feedback.  A black eye, a fat lip, and a job?  That's Kevin from Connecticut.  Yeah, of course. 
[01:14:30]  That's nacho cheese?  Eric C. from Boston Rice.  It's like Jeopardy for blank jokes.  God damn.  Do you want the last Tiger joke?  Yes.  Today, Ping Golf announced it's signing Elan.  Is that his wife's name?  Or Elan or Elan?  I don't know.  It's not Elan.  She has some kind of fancy pronunciation to this thing.  Elan to a multi-million dollar naming and fortune deal.  Your bicycle? 
[01:15:00]  For its new line of women's fairway woods.  Their new slogan, Elan Woods, clubs you can beat Tiger with.  Ah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  The cops.  Well, yeah.  That one I think we did already, though.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Dave.  Dave.  What's up, Dave?  Hey.  No tires.  Don't sing when you put chains on them.  All right. 
[01:15:30]  Jesus.  All right.  You know.  And, of course, this is the thing that gets the phones just aligned.  Oh, I know.  Believe me, we've seen this happen before.  We're trying to talk about health care or taxes.  Oh, forget about it.  This is what gets the phones going.  Why do we bother?  That was always a good one, though.  That was a gem.  I believe one of the boys was from Arkansas.  I believe tires don't. 
[01:16:00]  Water was deep.  Notice that the water is cold.  Get it.  I believe one of the boys was from Arkansas.  Get it?  Got it.  Make me some biscuits.  I'm a homicidal maniac from the nervous hospital.  Nervous hospital.  Nervous hospital.  That's an understatement, isn't it?  Yeah.  You're a little nervous.  Oh, wait.  You hacked your mom and...  And Jesse.  Poor old Jesse Dixon.  Fucking his mom.  Jesse.  She didn't mind what Jesse was doing to her. 
[01:16:30]  You want to listen, Tiger?  Yeah, please.  Alon is reportedly...  I don't know how they get all this info, by the way.  If Tyree's a very private person and not talking to anybody and he hasn't left his house in days,  how are they getting all this info that the media is talking about today?  People are tattletales.  Which one is that?  A Christmas tree has colored balls. 
[01:17:00]  It's Brian in Virginia.  He was going to take a little too far.  All you need is the last part.  That's the whole thing.  It's the...  Puzzle.  Ah, shit.  You motherfuckers.  I can't... 
[01:17:30]  Antique farm equipment.  I just got to stop laughing now.  Oh.  Funny shit.  A start?  All right.  Yeah, it's so far.  Jesus.  Peels the banana before he eats it.  Pizza can feed a family of four.  To keep them from jumping on the bed.  Take your foot off his head.  Did we do that one?  Let's get them all out of the way. 
[01:18:00]  Let's get them all out of the way.  God.  Aspirin works.  Janitor in a drum.  Because no one likes Mondays.  All right.  All right.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  That's funny. 
[01:18:30]  Branch manager.  You know, Rick.  Yeah, that was always a good one.  That was always a good one.  Yeah, that's a classic.  I think I heard that one before.  Mm-hmm.  Mm.  Elin.  Squarehead.  All right.  Elin.  That's how you pronounce her name.  Elin is reportedly being offered.  How do they know this shit?  A resigning bonus of $5 million to stay married.  That makes a healthy marriage when you have to do a resigning bonus.  Yeah, you're having contract negotiations for your marriage. 
[01:19:00]  How do they know this?  I have no idea, but it's all over the place.  A resigning bonus of $5 million to stay married to Tiger, about half of what A-Rod got when  he snapped, when he re-upped with the Yankees.  She'll get $80 million to hang with him another seven years.  So now their marriage is just a contract.  Yeah, now it's, they're negotiating for time?  Yeah, that's healthy.  Like, all right, I'll stay with you seven years, but you have to pay me this much, or  I leave right now for $5 million? 
[01:19:30]  That's some shallow thinking on her part, if she's thinking of doing this, by the way.  To me, that's prostitution.  How about get the fuck?  It's pathetic.  It's absolute prostitution.  It's fucking pathetic.  You're signing a deal, you're willing to be a high-powered date for fucking a few years,  that's prostitution.  It's pathetic, it really is.  Arm candy.  Tiger's boyhood pal, Byron Bell, this is the latest facts coming out today.  Bought a plane ticket for this busty Rachel, how do you say her last name?  It was just a whore. 
[01:20:00]  Let's call her Rachel the Whore.  Just a whore.  Bought a plane ticket for Rachel the Whore to go to Australia last month to secretly spend  time with Woods.  That's from TMZ.  The plumped-lipped Rachel the Whore also boasted about meeting up with Tiger at the bachelor  pad of Yankee Captain Dirk Jeter.  So they met at Dirk Jeter's pad.  That's coming out today.  Wow.  A friend of another alleged tiger birdie, Kalika, told the Post that while Kalika wasn't the 
[01:20:30]  hottest girl in Vegas, she did pretty well for herself.  Reached by phone last night, this Kalika broad or whatever, declined a comment.  The ex-boyfriend of another purported Woods girlfriend, Jamie Grubbs, who's the worst by  the way.  It's a nice name.  Yeah, sexy.  Uh, said Tiger once promised to leave his wife for her.  Jane Gum.  Jamie Mealworm.  Grub.  G-R-U-B-B. 
[01:21:00]  If you have two B's at the end of the end, that's terrible.  Grub.  Jamie Aphid.  Jamie Grubbs.  Jamie Grubbs is very delusional.  Tiger wasn't leaving his wife for a whore, you stupid whore.  How about Jamie Ciccata?  Jamie Bull Weevil.  I love the Bull Weevil.  It was the last time anyone had a Bull Weevil problem.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  Um, we learned that, uh, the What Happened clip. 
[01:21:30]  Well, what What Happened clip?  Well, this one.  What Happened?  That's Tiger's mom.  She was in the house the whole fucking time and all this was going down and ran out of  the house to see what the fuck happened, obviously.  Uh, after the wreck, neighbors found Woods out cold and snoring on the street.  Snoring?  And, uh, they didn't smell any alcohol.  And then finally, yeah, golfer, we talked about this yesterday, golfer Jesper Parnovic. 
[01:22:00]  He used to be a pretty good golfer.  I haven't heard his name in the golf world lately, myself.  He introduced Tiger to, uh, his wife there and told the Swedish newspaper, uh, I have lost  all respect for him, primarily as a man and a father.  It doesn't even feel like it matters what he has done on the golf course.  My respect for him as a person is gone.  Who cares what that cock blocker thinks?  Gone.  Let me hear the clip again.  What happened?  That's the same thing her father said when she brought her date home. 
[01:22:30]  What happened?  Oh, geez.  That's your Tiger update.  Yeah.  Uh, I've learned nothing.  I was just laughing at horrific jokes.  Oh, of course.  The entire time.  Skid marks in front of a dog.  Thank you, P-dog.  Yes, we know. 
[01:23:00]  So, blind people can hate, oh, okay, yeah.  Yeah, okay, we got it.  We got homeless guys to talk about and talk to, and we got Rich Voss here, so how about  we take a break, get Rich in here, and we'll get the homeless guys in here, and we'll start  this homeless shopping spree.  Get the excitement going for the homeless shopping spree.  Nice.  Yay.  On Twitter, O-A-H-S-S to follow us as far as the homeless shopping spree goes.  We'll continue in just a sec.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.

Yes, I'd like to give a great big giant fuck you to one of my co-workers, the big-headed  monster, but for some reason it takes some fucking pleasure in knocking me down.

I'm going to give a big fuck you to Danny from the ONA staff for the, uh, wow sticker  flaming retarded bus fire promo.  I can't stop saying, the lights are burning me!  Thanks, Danny.

Call the O.P. and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Friday.  There you are.  Love the Friday.  Rich Voss in studio.  Uh, this weekend, Overlook Lodge, Route 9 West, Bear Mountain, New York. 
[01:25:30]  That's where Rich is gonna be, right?  Visit bearmountain.com.  You should really go see Rich Voss if you're in the area.  Steve Voss came last week.  What?  Excuse me.  That's good for him.  I'm just saying, I have proof of how funny I was.  Oh yeah?  Cut me off.  Wow.  No, your mic was very low, or you're talking very low.  I wasn't ready to...  Well, we all turned into Lou Ferrigno.  Yeah, I know.  What are you doing?  Uh, Rich came in studio and was discussing the Jesse Ventura video with, uh, old Jimmy 
[01:26:00]  Norton, trying to get the, you know, inside scoop.  And, uh, I wrote it down, Ant.  Yeah.  Because it wasn't on the air, unfortunately.  How do you say Jesse's last name?  Ventura.  Oh, he does...  All right, thank you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he...  Yeah, he pronounces it, uh, Van-Tura.  Van-Tura.  Yeah.  I'm not a big fan of him, so...  New from General Motors, the Van-Tura.  We're back!  Van-Tura.  First of all, if I went to somebody, hey, did you see the conflict between, uh, Norton 
[01:26:30]  and Van-Tura?  They would know exactly what I'm talking about.  They would just stop and go, you didn't say it correctly.  So what if you said he liked President Obumo, they'd know who you meant, too.  And it's still think you're an idiot.  In Africa, that's what they call him, Obuma.  Van-Tura.  Van-Tura.  So, yeah.  It was very exciting in here, Rich.  Yeah, I saw some of it online.  Yeah, so it's Van-Tura Boulevard?  If you have, if you have an accent, you don't know how...  An accent? 
[01:27:00]  There's not an accent called Idiot.  Things don't come out completely the same all the time.  All right, listen.  Yes, you and Down Syndrome babies did.  We could enjoy, uh, Rich Voss's stupidity for...  Love, Rich.  ...for a while, but one of the homeless guys was just kind of wandering around.  I don't know where he's going.  That's what you're used to.  They're calling Rich...  Yeah.  They're calling Rich Van Bora.  He just started his appearance.  First of all.  Of course.  Yeah.  Oh, don't even get started.  First of all.  First of all is never a second of all.  Suicide.  That was a bit I did. 
[01:27:30]  I know.  I remember.  You like your suicide bit?  Yeah, you were in the great suicide story that's going on.  Yeah, we got two episodes, right?  Oh, that's fantastic.  You know something?  I have to throw my headphones away at Patty's voice.  Sexy Patty?  I cannot say...  Not a fan of Sexy Patty?  Oh, suicide!  It is repulsive on a level I can't even convey.  It's kind of sexy.  Yes, Daniel?  Not only is her delivery just atrocious, but she has no idea about, like, punctuation and grammar, 
[01:28:00]  and, like, she just enunciates, like, the wrong word.  Like, she'll just enunciate a word in the middle of a sentence for no reason.  I think at this point it's mine and Travis's favorite part where she just goes,  Now!  Do you want to hear it?  It's right in the middle of a sentence.  She completely doesn't start the sentence on the right word.  I have it queued up if you want me.  Oh, yeah.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it.  Sexy Patty.  Oh, my sweet suicide.  Now, with you out of the way, this city will finally be the best. 
[01:28:30]  It should be Now with you out of the way.  Now with you out of the way.  Now!  Now with you out of the way.  Now!  Ugh.  She is...  Sexy Patty.  Putrid.  Sexy Patty.  Did you like your part in the suicide thing?  Well, here's the thing with those things.  You know, I'm coming out of the studio last time I was here when I killed,  and what's his name?  She says, can you come in and read this real quick?  You know, there's no direction or anything.  It just says, read it.  So you don't know what character, you know, like when I read, 
[01:29:00]  what's his name from Bronx Tale?  Yeah, what's his name?  Louis Fiends.  What's his first name?  I'm helping you.  Nope.  Tell me his first name and I'll know his last name.  Nope.  He has a C.  Oh, yeah.  With a C?  His first name.  Oh, Chaz Palomari.  So, wait, you did not just say Chaz Palomari.  So, what's his name?  Chaz Palomari. 
[01:29:30]  You don't really think that, do you?  Palomari, Palomari.  Oh, Palomari.  I'm a Palomari.  I'm having some Palomari.  Fred Palomari.  Like that day, you guys.  No, I'm not done with this.  You throw the script.  Yeah, shut up, Rich.  He just plows through.  Please.  Say his name again.  You have bastardized another fucking name.  Did you put Vantor on the list?  On the door?  Yeah.  Can you put these next six on the list?  Yeah.  What's his name again?  Chaz Palomari.  I said Chaz Palomari.  All right.  What's his name? 
[01:30:00]  Palomari or Palomari or Palomaro.  He's already there.  Did he say it the same way last time?  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  It's already up there.  All right.  Wow.  You know, he just mispronounced it.  I don't even know how to say it now.  You just fucking...  Palman Terry.  You just fucking...  Oh, right.  Okay, right, right.  Palman Terry.  You left the N out.  No, but I got all fucked up because of...  And the T.  Oh.  That's a difficult name.  Try it now.  Chaz Palomari.  Palman Terry.  Now!  Look, I didn't come in here to go over names. 
[01:30:30]  I mean, you know?  Oh, suicide.  But, like, you go in there and they say,  read this.  You don't have direction.  You don't even know what he's doing with it.  He says, read the lines,  just like you do when I did Bronx Tale.  Woo-hoo.  Yeah, but...  So you're making excuses?  We thought you were making excuses.  Oh, no, no.  I thought your performance was good.  Yeah, I thought it was great.  I got a callback.  What do you think?  A callback?  What do you think?  When we do fucking, like, voices for GTA  and shit like that,  that we know the whole storyline?  For who?  Given a sheet?  Grand Theft Auto.  But first of all, 
[01:31:00]  you don't care.  You're given a sheet?  Why is there never a second of all?  I care very much about my voice work.  You do?  Yes.  Commercials?  No, not...  Well, oh, yes, my live reads are second to none.  But Grand Theft Auto, when I...  When you do those, yeah, you've got to put a voice on it and everything.  Oh, you've been on Grand Theft Auto?  Yeah.  On the games?  We all have.  Yes, we all have.  We as in I'm not.  Yes.  I have.  Who does that?  Who makes those?  Like, I mean, how do you...  Well, uh... 
[01:31:30]  Oh, I see.  Because you're on there and then you plug it and shit.  I see.  What?  It's fucking barter.  No, no, it's not barter at all.  It's Laszlo.  Did you get paid for it?  No.  Didn't it?  I did.  I didn't.  I got a game.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm in this game.  Yeah, we're just helping out a little bit.  We're not supposed to talk about it, so I won't say it, but...  Oh, I've got to do my part for that game.  You do?  How come they didn't invite me to do one?  Thanks, Lasz, for a big, fat nothing.  Aw, Jimmy should get a part.  I can do voices.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, get out of that car, yo.  That's perfect.  That would actually work.  That would be awesome.  Can you imagine running into Uncle Paul?  Oh, yeah.  Get out of that car.  Hey.  They should have, like, Ted Sheckler's something important, car emporium.  Get out of here.  I'll site you for candy.  He could be the new gun shop guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Ted Sheckler's fucking gun emporium.  They should put that in there.  You just go in and go, oh, could I get, you know...  Yeah, I'd like to try out one of these pistols. 
[01:32:30]  Stupid Ted.  You get to shoot him.  Ouch, you're hurting me.  I guess.  I'm voiceover in that cartoon movie with the big rooster and the little bird.  I go, get him, chopper.  I'm in that one.  You know what I'm talking about with the cartoon?  You're yelling something at your teeth?  My dentist, I talked to him yesterday, he wants to know if you guys need any work.  Talk to him.  What'd you say?  Why are you in hiding?  Where are you? 
[01:33:00]  Why have you left the country?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  They came out looking good.  These are temporary.  Wait, what does your dentist want?  If you guys need any work.  We all have dentists.  Exactly.  No, I don't.  Temporary?  Top New York dentist?  Why?  What's the difference?  He's not a top New York dentist.  I got a guy that cleans the shit out.  Oh, wow.  You need to be a top dentist to get the shit out from, you know, between my teeth?  Anyone can do that.  You ever pick the plaque from the back and you get, like, chips of, like, something? 
[01:33:30]  Chips?  Casino chips?  Hold on.  Let me get rid of my gum.  That will help a little bit.  Let's get the homeless guys in here.  You're ready to put it in Jimmy's yogurt.  I wouldn't do that.  Yes, you would.  No, I wouldn't.  Let's get the homeless guys in here.  Yeah, I got to do my voiceover for the fucking house.  Wow, that looks pretty cool.  If I'm going to be a yelling guy again, I have no desire to be in it.  Really?  Yeah.  It just gives me yelling guy parts.  That's how much I suck.  Let's get the homeless.  You could be yelling guy.  Huh?  One at a time and together.  I don't know.  I'd bring them both in. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, bring them both in.  Pop them on the couch.  We got our first two homeless guys for the homeless shopping spree going down in two weeks.  Less than two weeks.  Twitter account.  O-A-H-S-S.  Sign up for that one because that will give you all the updates and the pictures we take  today will be up there so you can check it out.  Sir?  All right, so excuse me, bro.  I got a broken foot.  Oh, shit.  You got a broken foot?  Yeah.  What's your...  I don't know about forklift.  Don't you have a doctor?  By a what?  I need a forklift.  A forklift?  Yeah, the guy was drunk. 
[01:34:30]  Driving a forklift drunk and he ran over your foot?  Yep.  God damn, that sucks.  Yo, I'm telling you, it hurts so bad.  I even went to the hospital, right?  Yeah?  They give me morphine.  Oh, shit.  Hey, don't do that.  Why?  You know why?  After you take morphine.  Yeah.  Good morning.  After you take morphine.  Yeah.  You can't take up.  What's a forklift doing under a bridge?  Oh, you can say take a shit.  You can't take a shit?  Yeah.  After you take morphine.  Barely after you take morphine. 
[01:35:00]  I tried that.  It blocks you up, right?  Huh?  It blocks you up so you can't shit.  Right.  Yeah, well, at least your parents stay clean for a couple days.  Yeah, I got hospital pads on here.  I tried, yo.  You know, look.  You knew.  I just wanted to say, hey, to my mother and my father, because I love my dad.  My dad's name is Richard W. Bowles.  He owns Dozier Cranes.  And here I am out here on the street, panhandling. 
[01:35:30]  We're trying to line.  Panhandling.  Where are you from, sir?  Yeah.  Connecticut.  Excuse me, sir.  No, where are you from?  Are you from New York?  Are you from?  No, I'm from Savannah, Georgia, sir.  Oh, Georgia.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I love it down there.  How'd you end up up here panhandling, as you say?  I was running from child support.  Oh, running from child support?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  How many kids do you end up having down there?  I got four, and I only owe 12,000.  And my daddy just bought my mama a new car. 
[01:36:00]  Uh-huh.  I mean, my sister a new car.  Oh, yeah.  I know I got the money home.  Uh-huh.  That's pretty heavy.  Oh, oh, oh.  Who me?  I ain't done yet.  Oh.  Sorry, President Obama.  We're talking kids soon.  It's my turn.  Here.  Look.  Yeah.  It's black or old.  I've been through hell and back.  Yeah.  I've seen crazy stuff happen.  No shit, huh?  I've watched people's faces get smashed on the pavement. 
[01:36:30]  I've stole money off the counter on the bar.  Oh, shit.  Well, I did that, too.  And, um...  Gotta make a living, right?  Hey.  Oh, fuck.  And you couldn't see a forklift coming at you?  Hey, look.  I was handing the man $2 to help him buy a beer.  All right?  And next thing I know, I had you money.  He's drunk driving the forklift.  It's black.  What was he doing? 
[01:37:00]  Like, what was he doing on a forklift?  He was working, obviously.  He was drunk on a forklift.  And he sleeps behind boxes.  And I ain't much on that no more.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, yeah...  Damn.  So, what were you doing there by the forklift?  Handing him $2 to get him a beer.  To get him a beer?  Why were you giving him money?  Well, because he's poor.  He don't make much money.  But he's got to make more than... 
[01:37:30]  Are you employed?  I'm unemployed right now, but I do HVAC work.  Oh, right.  I was a tin knocker myself.  Yo.  A tin knocker, son, I can tin knock at the H...  It don't matter what it is.  Yes.  Any kind of air conditioner I fix.  That's exactly what I was, my friend.  I was up in these fucking tiles,  putting in registers and flex pipe  and fucking hard pipe and scrim and returns  and putting fucking curbs up on the roof, 
[01:38:00]  cutting shit with sawzalls and dropping units on the...  Fuck yeah.  Come on.  I can take a torch.  I can take a torch.  I can take a torch.  See?  Put that line set on there.  And beautiful.  Right?  And weld.  I welded a great dang trailers for like seven years,  but they shut down now.  Oh, damn.  We felt a hard time.  Out of the two tin knockers,  how does the bigger alcoholic become the radio star?  Really?  Oh, oh.  I'm not only an alcoholic.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  I'm not a drug addict.  There you go.  See?  I don't smoke pot no more.  I quit.  So what are you into?  A little drinking?  Because you mix alcohol with pot,  what you get?  Fuck.  The guy next to you?  Candy man, according to Danny.  I get to Wallace, though.  Yeah.  You get to Wallace, though.  I ain't done yet.  I ain't done yet.  I ain't done yet.  I know.  I can't wait.  Listen, listen.  Yeah.  My daddy has got the finest Silverado in the world. 
[01:39:00]  Silverado.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  I'm talking about a pretty one.  Yo, it ain't got but 40,000 miles on it.  And it's a, what is it?  It's a 1998.  98?  Yeah.  All right.  He don't drive far anymore.  He retired at 62.  Uh-huh.  And why don't you have the type of relationship  where instead of panhandling,  you can go there and go,  hey, you know,  help a brother out over here. 
[01:39:30]  What happened?  Because I was scared of child sports,  so I ran.  Yeah.  My daddy said,  here, here's $1,000.  Take it and go.  Don't you miss your kids?  Yeah, I do.  How old are they?  You can't work something out.  My oldest one's 17.  And yo, last time I seen him,  he stole my money.  Oh, shit.  Apple don't fall apart from the tree.  That's some cold shit.  And I was trying to help him out.  Yeah?  Damn.

They didn't hear you.  I didn't have a question.  They didn't hear you.  Have you ever had to trade sex for money?  Like up in the Port Authority.

I got a nice car, everything, but I ain't got a license.  I got to pay $2,000 to get my license back.  And you got to pay $12,000 for the child support, so you can't go back there.  What made you pick New York? 
[02:01:30]  New York seems, you know.  Yeah, why not Georgia in the cold?  It's winter up here.  Why would you come where it's cold instead of staying there and going south where it's warm?  That's what my daddy told me.  Don't leave, son.  And he cried when I left.  Oh, shit.  And he cried when you got home, too.  Nah, he cried when I left, bro.  But why did you come?  Why didn't you go south?  I hurt my feelings, man.  The worst thing I ever did was leave.  So you should have stayed then.  Would you...  You know?  No?  Extradite your death.  I would like for that, man. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, they'd extradite you?  Too much rain.  But, yo, my dad's going to pay my way out.  Don't worry.  Yeah?  Are you the youngest?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's why.  My sister's, uh...

And plus, she does this little bullshit job cooking breakfast at some little joint.  I don't even know what the hell.  She ain't making shit.  My daddy generally takes care of him. 
[02:02:30]  Hell, they borrowed my daddy's lawnmowers and one of my lawnmowers to cut their grass.  Oh, shit.  And my daddy don't like our boyfriend at all.  He done told me one time he'd beat his butt.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  He isn't, um...  I never went to go there.  He don't treat my sister very well.  No?  Nah.  Is he, um...  Abusive?  Yeah.  What's he do?  He hit her.  Oh, what's he do for a living?  My daddy went over there and grabbed that man. 
[02:03:00]  I swear, my dad's a big old boy, too.  Yeah.  He's bigger than him.  Bigger than Keith the cop?  Wow.  That's crazy.  That's only 88% of the population.  That's huge.  That's crazy.  He's a mechanic.  Keith.  Keith.  He went over there and straightened him out, though.  Yeah.  My sister's still witty, man.  I don't know why.  Did you get in any fights at Rikers Island?  Yeah, I've been in a couple of them.  Yeah?  You knock them out.  Look at those hands.  You probably knocked the fuck around.  They do have some meaty hands that look like they've been...  Look at those fucking like mallets. 
[02:03:30]  ...been in a few fights.  Yeah.  Have been in a few fights.  I ain't gonna lie to you about it.  Man, I don't used to go into them, okay?  But when I was living in California...  Yeah?  I used to have...  I used to live in Cali.  And I did the Hollywood and Vine.  Oh, that's where famous people are, like Brian Parker.  Yeah, well, you know, it had its own one-room apartments, right?  So I lived out there, you know, but they're wild.  Yeah.  You think they're, you know, it's like, oh, Hollywood, you know... 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  You know, Hollywood is beautiful, but it isn't...  Oh, there's a seedy underside to Hollywood.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Oh, that's some crazy shit going on in Hollywood.  Man, I gotta go.  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  What's the matter, Licker?  I'm ready to go, man.  What happened?  What's the matter, Licker?  You okay?  No, I'm ready to go.  What happened?  Tell us what happened.  Did we do anything?  No.  It ain't us?  What happened?  I didn't drink.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  You getting the shakes a little bit? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, I hear you.  So am I.  Where are you going to get your liquor today?  I bought over there on...  Wow.  Behind Brown Park, right there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What, you going to get a pint?  Yep.  Get yourself a pint?  Wow.  Got any cash?  Yo, like they say, you got no one to hold them.  No one to fold them.  Well, there you go.  We met our first two homeless guys, man.  Liquor man.  I've been doing this a long time. 
[02:05:00]  And DJ.  Keep out on drinking.  I'll be like my Uncle Bernie, man.  I got stripper money here.  What the fuck is going on?  I see that.  That's when I went to...  I did.  I went to a strip club and fucking...  There you go.  I ended up with a bunch of dollars.  Christmas just came early.  Hey, guys, you're going to join us for the homeless shopping spree.  Tim.  Yeah.  Liquor man.  You're going to be joining us for the homeless shopping spree?  Yes, sir.  I am.  You keep in touch with Keith the Cop because it's a great day for you guys.  All right.  You'll get a lot of stuff.  It's in a couple weeks.  The fans just buy you stuff.  It's real.  You go to a mall and the fans give you money and buy you shit. 
[02:05:30]  It's real.  It's real.  Where's that?  Tina.  You don't remember Tina, man.  Keith will take care of it.  I remember Tina.  Tina got run over.  Yeah.  Get hit by the bus.  We heard about it.  We heard about that shit.  All right.  Liquor man is shaking like a motherfucker.  We got to get him out of here, man.  Yeah.  Give him a...  Thank you.  I mean...  I got a shit with a lot of singles.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Buy yourself some booze.  Have fun with that.  Oh, man.  Liquor man is happy now.  Liquor man.  Real happy.  We got more of that if you come back for the homeless shopping. 
[02:06:00]  That's great.  When is that?  When is that going to be?  What day is that?  It's the 17th of December.  Where are you going to meet me at?  About two weeks.  You don't have support authority today.  We'll keep in touch before then.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to have a card.  It's a fun day.  A card?  Keith has one, yes.  You know, because me...  No, I don't know.  All right, DJ.  Any final words before we get you out of here?  Earl.  Earl's still going.  I got a final word right here.  All right.  Thank you, gentlemen.  No problem, Licka.  And God bless everybody here and the cross on this man's neck. 
[02:06:30]  Ah.  Because we're all going to heaven.  Yep.  Even though we sin and everybody sins, even this man sins.  It's like a Southern preacher.  He tries not to preach it as a sin.  Well, look, it's the way life is.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You give, you receive, you receive, you receive, you give.  I give most of mine away.  I get liquor.  First thing I know is somebody walks up to me and says, hey, man, give me a swallow. 
[02:07:00]  Hey, man, go ahead and get you one.  Oh, yeah?  They drink all my shit.  I'm looking there going, man, what the hell you just do that for?  And then I'm thinking.  A nip slip?  But you know what, man?  The worst thing about it all is, uh, Keith.  What is that, my friend?  Shit, that's smooth as shit.  You should remember when?  Sorry.  I was just looking at my list.  Where at?  What time?  In the afternoon.  What time?  I'm going to come get you at noon.  All right.  At noon?  Why don't we get back here?  Yeah, I got to take a piss.  Yeah, we got to take leaks.  All right, guys.  We'll see you again soon. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Give me a link to that.  All right.  DJ wants to say something.  DJ wants to say something.  What do you want to say, DJ?  Oh, yeah.  Check it, check it.  Come on, let me help, help me out.  Put your money in your wallet, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Put your money away.  Someone's going to fucking...  Say what you want to say, DJ.  Yeah, DJ.  What do you want to say?  What do you want to say?  It was really an inspirational day.  Yeah?  Very.  Thank you, man.  You know...  And liquor, man, you have a good day.  There you go, liquor, man.  Take care of yourself, bro.  All right, liquor, man.  All right.  Okay.  All right, and of course, DJ... 
[02:08:00]  Welcome down to the boss's office.  It was a very inspirational day.  Inspirational day.  It was.  Well, wait until the homeless shopping spree, because you're going to get more money, and  a bunch of fans of the show, they're going to buy you good winter clothes and shit like  that, so it's much nicer to be on the street.  And...  The streets are cold.  Oh, hell yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Say hi to Michelle.  And, like, you know, like...  Listen, it's real.  It's like...  It's real.  It's like an Obama-Bill Cosby thing. 
[02:08:30]  All right, enough.  Beat it.  Jesus.  What do you want from us?  No, I...  All right.  That's all right.  All right.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  DJ, thank you, DJ.  We'll see you again soon.  Put your money away.  Someone's going to fucking...  Roll you for your money.  Yeah, they're going to fucking take your shit.  I got it.  Some new stuff.  Yeah.  And he has a whole pile of stuff.  I know.  I got a bag of stuff.  That's his goods.  What's in your bag of stuff?  Clothes and shit?  What's in there? 
[02:09:00]  Mark Felix the Cat.  You know what I'm saying?  That's his magic bag, right?  Oh, you got a magic cat.  I'm going to make it into an airplane.  Oh, shit.  Thank you.  And, oh, this is just things I think sell at the supermarket.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, DJ.  All right.  I thought it was your blanket.  Well, thank you for sharing.  No, that was my...  Thank you for sharing, sir.  Go ahead and create a date.  Take it easy.  All right.  Great day.  We'll see you soon.  We'll see you soon.  Love you all along.  Take care. 
[02:09:30]  We'll see you for the homeless shopping spree.  Bye, DJ.  December 17.  Barack DJ.  Take care.  Happy holiday.  Anthony, we posted a couple pictures of these guys on the Twitter account, OAHSS.  So follow us if you're into the homeless shopping spree.  Follow us on Twitter as far as the homeless shopping spree goes, OAHSS.  And Sam took some video.  That'll be up a little later tonight.  All right.  They were good contestants, I think.  If that's an indication of some of the crop out there.  We're going to do just fine.  We're going to have a great homeless shopping spree. 
[02:10:00]  It's not that bad.  No, no.  Honestly, I was eating yogurt while they were in here.  I didn't care.  Yeah, maybe that's why you didn't really...  There is a very rank...  Dude, after Tippi Tom and his rotting leg...  Well, that's just it.  It's like, you know...  Nothing bad.  Obviously, if you go see fucking Led Zeppelin, another band isn't going to seem quite up  to par.  I don't understand that comparison.  All right.  Tippi Tom was the Led Zeppelin of homeless.  The Led Zeppelin of homeless.  But you don't like Led Zeppelin. 
[02:10:30]  Well, I'm just saying.  In general.  I absolutely know how big Led Zeppelin was.  Okay.  No, you know what?  Tippi Tom was huge.  These guys are going to be just fine.  Of course.  I like these guys.  I like...  The fact that DJ just kept talking over...  Liquor Man.  And Liquor Man wouldn't stop talking.  The problem is that they're all going to start going through DTs without liquor.  This whole thing of...  Yeah, but this whole thing of...  You know...  Yeah, we know how to.  We'll figure it out.  Oh, why?  You think that'll be a problem?  Listen, it's so weird. 
[02:11:00]  Last night I watched...  Days of Wine and Roses.  Yeah.  You ever see that?  We watched...  Yeah, it's because you were in high school and they released it.  I watched that.  Full-blown alcoholism.  And you just enabled him and gave him money to get more alcohol.  So what?  What else is he going to do?  He's going to get it anyway?  Is he going to get anyone with that?  You don't practice tough love on a guy who you don't know and it's this cold out and  he's...  Let him do what he wants.  If he's hungry, he'll probably get food and booze.  The homeless shopping spree guys, you want them to come back too.  So you don't get 20 bucks.  I'm a fan of keeping these guys calm.  Because if he doesn't get his alcohol, guess what? 
[02:11:30]  Someone gets hit with a brick day.  Because he doesn't get the DTs.  Let him.  Right.  Someone gets hit with a brick.  Yes.  Exactly.  The stories are in the paper all the time.  Let him drink.  That's because they didn't get their drink.  He'll be all happy.  Look at Obama on TV now.  See?  I didn't see Obama.  Come on, dude.  That was definitely an Obama thing on it.  It was the shape of the head and the ears.  It wasn't so much the middle face.  The hair a little bit.  Yeah, the middle face wasn't there.  But there's just something.  Well, some pictures are up on that Twitter account.  O-A-H-S-S.  We want to push that.  Retweet that shit.  That's how you can follow the homeless shopping spree this year. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  We're going to continue with Rich Voss in just a bit.  Stay there.  Rich Voss in studio today.  He's playing the Overlook Lodge, Route 9 West, Bear Mountain, New York.  Visit bearmountain.com.  You're doing the Overlook?  Oh, how great is that?  The Overbite or the Overlook?  Hey, I have a...  What?  The Overlook Lodge.  I hope when you walk in and you're looking for the audience, you're like, 
[02:12:30]  Is anybody here?  Is anybody here?  And a guy in a burgundy jacket puts an axe in your chest.  What?  Is that from a movie?  Oh, my God.  No, it's not.  I'm just creating something odd as I go along.  Is it shining or something?  Yeah, it's a Jim Norton original.  Why?  Because at the part where the hallway started lighting on fire, that's when I lost it.  It never happened in the movie.  What?  Yeah, when she saw the fucking long hallway catching on fire, Shelly Duvall or whatever. 
[02:13:00]  No, it wasn't fire.  Or whatever, yeah.  It was blood coming out of the elevator.  Blood, blood, blood.  Are you scared?  Blood, fire, he says.  He just says blood, fire.  You're shining as hard.  Close enough.  It's a scary movie?  It's a horrifying movie.  I don't like those kind of movies anyhow.  Well, I have a question real quick.  Yeah, Rich.  Being this is my third year.  Your son.  Being this is my third year doing this.  Oh, it's right.  It's empty.  Do you think maybe I can get a gift card myself to get some stuff there?  Maybe?  A little gift card for Richie? 
[02:13:30]  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  Why not?  They're free, aren't they?  Jew, are you, Mr. Voss?  Married man, are you?  You took your false teeth and chopped your wife up in little bits.  I don't recollect that at all.  That's so funny.  It's just a guy in his mask is blowing somebody in a pig mask.  I play The Overlook. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, fuck.  There you go, right?  What's that?  This is your entrance music.  It's the music you can't hear.  This is the famous music from The Shining.  You should come on to this because it's The Overlook.  Yeah.  Don't you have a Tiger Woods joke?  Come and play with us.  I had a couple.  Well, the day, the next morning, it was relevant then when he hit the tree.  What did he say?  I said, the good news is he didn't go OB. 
[02:14:30]  He didn't go out of bounds.  That was the good news when he hit the tree.  But he did go out of bounds because he hit a tree.  He bounced back in.  Oh, he bounced back in.  Did he bounce back in?  Yes.  That's like an inside golf joke.  I'd love to trash it, but I don't quite get it.  I don't know golf.  I'm sorry.  Whenever he was getting blown, right before his balls hit her chin, he would yell four.  That's a joke I get in despise.  Be more funny.  That joke was terrible.  I know.  I just thought of it in the dressing room.  In the dressing room. 
[02:15:00]  Steve's office.  Exactly.  In the green room.  What do you want to talk about today, Rich?  I don't know.  It's your show.  What do you got?  What's going on?  Now, this is...  You know, because we have these guys in here that are...  Well, one was definitely a full-blown alcoholic.  And I can't come up with a conclusion or a definite opinion, but we were watching Dr.  Drew's sex addiction house the other night, and he has the alcohol one.  And I can't decide if he's doing good or exploiting. 
[02:15:30]  Exploiting.  I think both.  He's completely exploiting.  He's exploiting.  Yeah.  Completely exploiting.  Why is he doing it with nobodies?  He's doing it with celebrities.  Yeah.  That's right.  Why is it on TV?  Dr. Drew is full of bunk.  And when one of these people have a real issue on the show, he can't wait to get the cameras  in their face.  He's completely exploiting.  Ratings, money first, and maybe helping a little bit.  That's right.  A little bit in the end.  A little bit.  Cookies and hats second. 
[02:16:00]  All my questions answered, and that's what I want to talk about.  I'm out.  That was it?  No, I mean, I have really nothing.  Well, what do you think?  I kind of think it's exploitation.  Of course.  I mean, they couldn't get real celebrities for the sex house, because no real celebrities  are going to go into that.  You know, I mean, it's easy to admit you're an alcoholic, but it's not easy to admit that  you're a sex addict.  You're the moron, Mr. Voss.  You've always been the moron.  What's that from?  Exactly.  What's that from? 
[02:16:30]  Are you kidding me?  It's his high school graduation picture, 1921.  I don't want to break the news to you, but I quit high school.  I'm going to help you out.  Your jokes are no good here, Mr. Voss.  Oh.  The theme of this segment is The Shining.  Hair of the buck-toothed rabbit that bit me, Lloyd. 
[02:17:00]  See?  It's The Shining.  I'm going to watch it now, so I can...  I like you, Lloyd.  You're the best damn dentist from here to Portland, Oregon.  Yeah.  You got to watch it.  I can't wait.  It's Kubrick.  I don't like scary movies. 
[02:17:30]  Well, it's a classic.  It's more like a slasher movie.  Yeah, it's more than a scary movie.  It's very suspenseful and scary.  Yeah.  It's a classic.  I watched Days of Wine and Roses last night.  You go, I wouldn't watch that.  Stop saying the name of that movie.  I go, that's a classic.  Why would I watch that, though?  It's not a classic.  What is it about?  Your life.  Wine.  Well, I mean, she wasn't 17, but still.  Oh.  But it is...  You would love the movie.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'll watch it, and then if I don't love it, it's going to be a problem. 
[02:18:00]  Why would you love the movie?  Then we'll have a problem that I've invested time.  I don't like that.  When somebody recommends a movie, and you watch it, and you go,  that guy just wasted a couple hours of my life.  I just ordered three drug and alcohol movies.  That one, I never saw The Lost Weekend, and The Man with the Golden Arm.  Jim Abbott.  Lost Weekend.  Is that good?  That's an old one.  That's another old one.  All teeth and no play.  Makes rich a dull boy. 
[02:18:30]  But my teeth aren't even big anymore.  Oh, they certainly are.  No.  If they were green, they'd be a great hedge base.  And giant.  Are you getting any of these?  Or to chase a boy through your teeth with an axe.  Rich, you're getting any of these?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Tony's a little boy who drowns in my mouth. 
[02:19:00]  So, Bonnie, when you hear this noise,  it means I'm writing a joke.  You'll never hear it.  Oh, my God.  That was a good one. 
[02:19:30]  Bonnie.  What's the matter, Rich?  I got nothing.  You don't know the movie.  I don't know the movie.  But it is.  That's something everybody has seen that.  That's right.  No.  Yes.  Did it win an Oscar?  Was it nominated?  No, it's a horror film.  Kubrick, it's a beautifully shot movie.  One of the best horror films ever.  Yeah.  What's the matter with you? 
[02:20:00]  All right.  I was going to watch it, but I'm not supposed to.  See?  That's great.  I'm not supposed to.  I'm not supposed to.  Rich, what was the last good movie you saw?  Last night I saw Days of Wine and Roses.  No.  Like a current movie. 
[02:20:30]  Good one?  Yeah.  We rented one, rented or in a theater?  I mean, we rented one the other night.  It was pretty good.  The Miden, something with a fucking, they didn't, what the fuck are you laughing at?  It was with William Macy.  Ah, yeah.  Christopher Walken and Morgan Freeman.  The Miden heist or something?  Or fucking the Miden heist?  I don't know what it is, but I know it's not the Miden heist.  The Miden heist.  The Miden heist, yes. 
[02:21:00]  Well, heist is definitely in it.  I've never heard of this movie.  Yeah, it didn't come anywhere.  But I know it's not called the Miden heist.  The Miden heist.  The Miden heist.  Here's Tommy.  The Miden heist.  Hold on.  Chris, Pocono.  Chris, Pocono, let's go.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  All teeth and no funny make Voss a dumb boy. 
[02:21:30]  Well, we already kind of covered that, but I didn't say unfunny.  I do.  But here's the thing.  Here's Tommy.  Jim in Virginia.  Jim.  Hey, Voss, do you clean your teeth with a snowcat?  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  The snowcat.  He has no idea.  This is why this is great.  Jeremy in Missouri.  Go ahead, Jeremy.  No cat.  Hey, if somebody doesn't end up getting Vonnie away from Voss, she's going to end up looking  like the little old lady in the tub. 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  Oh.  I'll punch it out.  Oh, well.  All right.  You tried.  Let's go to Chris in Little Rock.  Chris?  All right.  Chris.  Just listen to the show.  He's having a good time listening to the show.  He wanted to say, Red Dumb, Red Dumb.  Oh, that's a good one.  Red Dumb.  Red Dumb.  Jeremy, New York.  Do you like toothpaste, Doc? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, that's great.  Let's go to Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  K-I-K-E 12.  The K-I-K-E.  And he's gone.  Mongo, best caller of the day.  I'm calling it right now.  Tweak that shit, Mongo.  Best caller of the day right now.  Oh, shit.  That is good.  All right.  That's fucking funny. 
[02:23:00]  Uh-huh.  Very creative.  This is all from the movie.  Yeah.  The Shining.  The Shining.  Exactly.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, yeah.  You leave off like that.  I mean, that's brilliant.  God damn K-I-K-E 12. 
[02:23:30]  Fuck.  We might have another one coming in.  Oh.  Man.  Let's say hi to Scott in D.C.  Scott.  Good evening.  What's happening?  Hey, Scott.  Perhaps Bonnie should be called a stress.  He did it in lost fashion.  Oh, God.  Chris in Orlando.  Chris.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Chris.  So when do you think we should take him to the dentist? 
[02:24:00]  Let's go to Eric.  Eric.  Bonnie, give me the toothbrush.  The toothbrush.  Okay.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, right on.  Mm-hmm.  Bonnie, give me the toothbrush.  Let's say hi to Gooch.  Gooch.  He was a very stupid boy.  He should have been aborted.  These fuckers just hang up right away. 
[02:24:30]  They know how to do a call.  What else is going on, Rich?  Is he all right?  I got nothing going on.  Should have been aborted.  A retard.  A retarded comic.  Oh, Dan's got one. 
[02:25:00]  Dan?  Yo, guys.  Dang.  How you doing?  Hey, my favorite scene from the movie was when boss's drool filled up the hallways in the hotel.  The old lady comes out of his mouth.  You've got to see this movie, Rich. 
[02:25:30]  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Let's go to Sonny Ferelli.  Sonny.  Ah, yes.  Your Jew money's no good here.  It's not Jew money.  What the fuck?  Hey, you see, it's, uh, you can rent it. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Get it from Netflix or something.  Greg?  Hey, come floss with us, Rich.  Holy shit.  Sometimes me and my grandmother would have entire conversations without ever using our brains. 
[02:26:30]  Wyland.  I don't want to hurt you.  I don't want to hurt you.  I just want to bore you fucking brains.  Let's say hi to Rich.  Rich on the phone.  What do you got, Rich?  Hey, maybe boss saw the shitting.  The shitting. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, this is a good one.  Chris, what do you got, buddy?  Chris.  All his teeth got to shine.  Fuck, man.  All right, Rich, seriously, what else is up?  What?  How do you not see that movie?  What do you got going on?  What do I got going on?  What do you want to talk about?  I got nothing.  I got nothing.  The news?  Anything in the news?  The holidays?  What do you got?  What do you got?  I'm going to L.A. next week. 
[02:27:30]  I'm looking for this post.  I got nothing.  You got nothing?  No.  I got nothing.  You like toothpaste?  I got nothing.  Steve Ravish.  Yeah, this is Dick Halloran.  I got to get back to the overbite.  Ah, shit. 
[02:28:00]  Uh-huh.  Ah, shit.  Come on.  Oh, Steve.  Very funny.  I can't believe Rich hasn't seen it.  I know.  Come on.  Let's say hi to Johnny.  Johnny!  He's being helped by a dentist.  What?  What?  I don't think you got that one.  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Good effort, I guess.  Yeah.  Okay, let's say hi to Bob.  Bob!  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, Bob.  You're mistaken, sir.  I've always been the comic here.  Well, almost went through that.  Yeah, boy.  Well, the wheels are falling off now.  The wheels are falling.  I love that saying.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  All right. 
[02:29:00]  Well, we got a woman finding the Virgin Mary in a pancake.  These stories are terrific.  My daughters didn't like my teeth.  Took a book of matches and tried to burn them down.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, well, we're moving on.  Yeah.  My daughters didn't like my teeth. 
[02:29:30]  No, I'm just waiting for them to screen the phone calls.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what it is.  I keep asking Rich why he hasn't seen the movie.  Yeah.  Well, let me...  Okay.  I wish I had something to add.  Let's say hi to Chris.  Chris?  Hey, this guy wanted me to watch this hotel and kill my family, and now I'm goshing him. 
[02:30:00]  That's all right.  All right.  Virgin Mary in a pancake.  An Arizona woman says she's feeling a little closer to God as Christmas approaches.  Bianca Lopez says she was making breakfast for her family when she spotted this silhouette in one of her pancakes.  After taking a closer look, she was certain it was an image of the Virgin Mary.  She says for her, the Virgin...  My favorite part is when Rich chews through the door and says, here's Chewy.  Good job, Brian. 
[02:30:30]  We got canned fruits and vegetables, canned fish and meat, trees, drywall, electrical wiring.  Cigars and scotch.  Oh, boy.  CS, what do you got, buddy?  Eight months, seven days and two weeks of sobriety without a drop or drink in my body.  That's a horrible harm it has done me. 
[02:31:00]  I wouldn't touch one tooth in his head.  Red gums, red gums.  Jesus.  Set.  Good job, set.  Per, the Virgin Mary pancake carries a special message. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, does it?  I think it's like God's way of telling us not to forget about him and that he's always there.  Watching over us and taking care of us.  Lopez says she plans to hold on to the heavenly breakfast for as long as she can.  He's terrible, this guy.  Yeah, really.  Breakfast is more.  Is that supposed to be the Virgin Mary in a pancake, really?  Looks like a cum stain.  The fuck is that?  Looks like an Ed Hardy shirt.  That's even better. 
[02:32:00]  There you go.  There you go.  That's very funny.  Yeah.  These motherfuckers.  Rich, what else you got?  Oh.  Yeah, Rich.  You had time to think.  What do you want to talk about today?  What do I want to talk about?  Yeah.  Uh.  I need to get in touch with Carol Burnett.  All right.  Please elaborate.  Why?  For the documentary.  Oh.  Cool. 
[02:32:30]  And Christopher Hitchens.  If you listen.  Hitchens.  I said it good.  I didn't slob on it.  You really didn't care about it?  Yes.  All right.  What does that mean?  Yeah.  You can't even get me Dick Barnett.  He was a Knick player that used to shoot lefty and kick his foot back from the foul line.  No one knows him.  I do.  Unfortunately.  I wish I didn't.  He had the weirdest fucking jump shot.  His fucking heels would hit his butt every time he shot a jump shot.  I'm still running through the shiny in my head. 
[02:33:00]  I know.  It's just all I can think about.  It's all I can think about.  Well, let's go to Larry King.  Larry!  Yes, Rich Voss.  Is it true your favorite food is corn on the cob?  Larry King poppin'.  Man.  You gotta do the right.  That's electrical.  What does that gotta do with...  I don't know.  I mean, if you're doing Larry King, you gotta try the accent, please.  Larry, between you and me, we got a serious problem with the people taking care of this 
[02:33:30]  place.  They turned out to be complete unfunny assholes.  Can't fucking stop.  I can't believe you.  I haven't seen that, really.  Yes, you can.  You're stalling.  Fantastic movies.  Yeah, what else do you got, Rich?  Well, I don't like you planting the seed that I'm unfunny because that's quite... 
[02:34:00]  No, never, never, never.  You know what happens?  This direction.  You disprove that every time you hit the stage.  Every time.  And the last ten times in here, except for today.  I've seen Rich Voss on stage and...  You're so insecure.  It's hysterical.  I can't talk to be as insecure as you.  I'm fucking losing it.  Why are you losing it?  You're a funny fucking guy.  We like beating you up.  That's all.  And I love seeing your stand-up.  Everybody does. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, I know.  Like, I...  Why are you losing it, Rich?  Let's talk.  What's going on with you?  Uh, just, you know, it's been a tough couple weeks.  Why?  Oh, shit.  What's going on?  Sit back.  What's going on in Rich Voss's world?  I think I'm...  My, uh, engine.  I blew a rod.  Your engine?  Are you being literal or figuratively?  I quit drugs.  He doesn't know what figurative means.  He's never figurative. 
[02:35:00]  He doesn't understand what metaphors are.  Are you kidding me?  But, Rich, why don't you just do what everyone else does that has a little money and buy a new car?  Yeah.  And you don't have to worry about this shit for a while.  One that you don't get off Amazon.  Yeah, you're a fucking moron.  That's your first problem.  I think...  No.  You blew a rod, so that means your car is fucked.  Is a rod your old drug dealer?  He means I blew a rod.  Really?  It's called TMZ.  Jesus.  It's been exclusive.  No, things are all right. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, what's going on, Rich?  You're right there.  I get a little depressed this time of the year.  Why is that?  The holidays?  Yeah, not the holidays.  It gets cold out.  I sit around.  Well, it sucks, but...  Rich, darker, earlier, right?  Hold on, though.  I can relate to this shit.  I'm better, though.  Because you had shitty fucking Christmases growing up, didn't you, Rich?  We didn't have them.  I'm a Jew.  So every...  Oh.  Oh, God, for a second.  I was going to go with...  All that happened. 
[02:36:00]  I thought you were proving my point by going, yeah, we didn't have them.  Well, here's the thing.  You had shitty Hanukkahs growing up.  Yeah.  Our holidays were horrible.  Now, when this season comes around, it makes you a little fucking nutty inside, right?  Well, not only that, our family, out of my whole family, was like the poor family, and  you know, they looked down on us.  So whenever we get together with relatives, it was like, you know, you walk in with the  single mother who they all kind of picked on.  You know what I mean?  Your own relatives picked on your mom?  Well, they were kind of, you know.  Why? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's healthy.  Because, you know, she didn't have as good of a life as my relatives.  The fault of hers?  And she had, you know, three fucked up kids.  Oh.  It was the fault of his.  So holiday season, I'm not really...  For the kids, you know.  You step up for the kids.  Yeah.  Hasn't that made it better that, like, you know, you're married, you got kids and stuff  like that, and hasn't it made this time of year better?  Because, you know, you're around Thanksgiving and the holidays, I'll just say. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, we go to my father's house.  Fucking Bonnie makes a nice turkey, makes stuffing and gravy, and we take it into my father, and  as we're leaving, my father gives Bonnie a recipe for gravy and a fucking bullion cube.  Oh, shit.  He says, here, take this.  Obviously, he didn't like her fucking gravy.  Apparently.  Yeah.  You know, but what do you say to an 82-year-old man?  And, you know, be fucking happy that we brought a fucking turkey to your house, okay, with  all my kids, you know. 
[02:37:30]  I had, you know, the baby there just went all over the place, and my two teenagers had  hated being there, you know, and we're fucking lugging the turkey, and then, you know, the  holiday, you know...  But it bums you out?  No.  You know, it's a fucking...  When you're a Jew, you don't feel...  You know, when you...  It's like sharks in the jets.  When you're a Jew.  When you're a Jew.  Holidays are overrated.  I'm a big fan of January 2nd.  You just...  You go all over the fucking place, you know, it's like, hey, it's, you know, it's definitely 
[02:38:00]  like...  No, it's...  It sucks.  Your son is attempting to bring a blithering idiot into this situation.  I don't mind the holidays for my kids.  I love getting my kids stuff, you know.  You and Bonnie are right?  Oh, yeah.  We had sex last night.  We had a big fight last...  The other day.  Why'd you fight?  What was the fight about?  Fuck, uh...  We're all depressed you didn't bring her today, by the way. 
[02:38:30]  Was she mad that you told the kids the story of the Donald party?  We like when Bonnie's here.  We...  What was the fight about?  What the fuck do we have?  It was a big one.  I'm like our pilot.  He saw it on the TV.  What the fuck?  She asked me to do something with the baby.  And I was working.  And she thinks...  She goes, your stuff is more important than mine.  I go, no.  She doesn't get that it's, you know, the whole... 
[02:39:00]  You know, the whole fucking motor makes the car work.  You know what I mean?  Oh, he's using figurative...  No, he actually means the whole motor.  Oh, he means the whole motor.  Because he was actually standing in front of a car when he said it.  When you pull three things out of the engine of the motor,  and then jiggle them in your palm,  your wife can't get back down the mountain.  Why don't you drive the car?  We had a blow-up fight.  Go check it out.  We had a blow-up fight, you know. 
[02:39:30]  And what I'm thinking, you know...  And then you're thinking, well, what the fuck?  How do...  Did she think you chewed through Danny's sweater?  Jesus.  You had the movement of Dean Martin.  That's funny.  See, Rich?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, if you're fucking 50 years old.  52.  So, what?  You had a fight.  Wow, who's blasting off some... 
[02:40:00]  Anus.  I mean...  I mean, I gotta block my nose now.  I don't smell anything.  This is so bad.  You don't smell anything.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Wow, that's really bad.  Yeah.  So, you had the big blow-out.  Yeah, we had a big blow-out the other day.  Yeah.  And did we find out what that was about?  No.  I'm trying to think.  He said something about...  Oh, God.  That you're selfish.  Yeah.  Because you are.  No, I'm not.  I've seen you two together.  You're very selfish.  No, I'm not.  You don't know what I add. 
[02:40:30]  You know, I got a fucking collapsing career.  I got a fucking worry about that.  I got a fucking...  All right?  I just fucking...  I had...  You're doing the whole much shopping spree.  Your career's on the up.  Three years ago, four years ago, I had fucking Oscars, TV shows, Tough Crowd, Last Comic,  fucking all over the place.  You guys had some fucking heat.  You know, everything.  The Oscar gift bag, $100,000.  We're getting our heat back.  We're getting our heat back.  You know more than anyone, careers have ups and downs.  That's true.  You have your peaks and your values.  You just hope that, you know, there's a constant in there somewhere. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  And that's it.  You know how it is with careers?  Your career has peaks and craters.  Peaks and chasms.  Peaks and bottomless pits.  Yes.  And black holes.  But we do look forward to your down.  Mulhills and craters.  You're on.  We look forward to your down.  To my down?  Yes.  Why do you look forward to that?  It'll just be fun to watch.  Speed bumps and chasms.  Well, I'm on my way back up. 
[02:41:30]  I'm on my way back up.  Are you?  Well, you got the L.A. trip, Rich.  Really?  What's going on in L.A.?  I'd be better off going to Louisiana.  What the fuck?  We're going to interview a couple people.  L.A., see?  Yeah, you got the documentary.  It could be a big thing for you guys.  I think it's going to be big.  The documentary is something big.  Yeah, it is.  You know.  So how was the sex last night?  That was good.  She feels looser.  Really?  Really, does she?  What kind of a, what, sex regular?  Yeah, I think I even kissed her.  Uh, did you, uh, doggie or regular? 
[02:42:00]  Just regular.  How long did you fuck for?  Until I came.  How long was that?  What?  Uh, we beat the commercial.  Do you talk dirty to each other?  No, but I love that.  I love, oh God, I love just hearing, just tell me stories of fucking the past, man.  Tell me, you know, the professor story.  Oh, are you crazy?  You like when she tells you.  I don't need to know that shit.  Oh, I just.  Old fuck stories.  I like you.  I love old fuck stories. 
[02:42:30]  Like, uh, and then, uh, I didn't know what was happening.  The white people with the white people.  She picked me up to change me.  She came up with a new word, uh, molest, molestorable, molestable, molestorable.  That's when you're so cute as a kid.  Oh, you're molestorable.  Molestorable.  That's a good word.  Last night was, you know, but yeah, stories are fucking great.  What are you kidding me?  Like, you know, oh, and you just, you're fucking and you're dreaming, you know. 
[02:43:00]  Are you thinking of like some other guy fucking her like that?  Oh God, I can't do that because then I'd come too quick.  Are you crazy?  I understand that though.  It's hard to sexualize people you love sometimes.  So it's like, it's a way of sexualizing.  Or even your wife.  It's hard to, go ahead.  I didn't mean.  That's right.  It's hard to sexualize people you love.  So it's a way of kind of pornographing somebody you really like. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, it's hot.  I remember, uh.  You don't care about the person I can see.  This was when I first, when I first met Bonnie, when we first started dating.  We were working in Pittsburgh.  Another club won't use me.  And we're working in Pittsburgh.  They won't use you?  I'm listening.  I have to blow my nose.  So we, uh, we were after the show hanging out.  We went across the street to get something to eat at this bar.  And there was this couple there that saw our show.  Right?  And the guy wanted us to go back to his place. 
[02:44:00]  And, and I was just dating her and switch up.  You know, she wouldn't have anything to do with it.  And that was about five years ago.  That fantasy has still been in my fucking head for five years.  I could still see his face and her face.  The other lady's face.  Wow.  And, and just fucking, oh.  Oh.  Just, you know.  Yeah.  Just fucking.  Just to see that black face on top of your.  Oh, are you kidding me?  We're in.  That's terrible.  It's not terrible.  In Pittsburgh, there's probably some guy with a Dave, fucking, a bad Dave Wanstatt mustache 
[02:44:30]  and a mullet.  Some guy that looks like Joe Dirt.  That's kind of a look I'm cultivating these days.  I really need a haircut.  Oh, it was fucking John Cazale and the deer hunter.  Please.  Cultivating?  You fucking got a lock on it.  This is terrible, I know.  I better just take a scissor and cut it off of the bag.  So you guys are back, though.  You had sex last night.  Things are good, Rich.  Oh, yeah, though.  They're up and down, you know. 
[02:45:00]  But it's just sex is.  Uh, fucking, uh.  I'm not talking about your neck.  No one heard it.  Everyone heard it.  Wait.  Close the floor.  They're just a couple.  What happened?  I've already contacted a divorce lawyer.  That's when you, when you get in a fight and you hear that one.  Really?  That's when you, that's when you start going.  Did she really say that at some point?  Yeah.  I've already contacted a divorce lawyer. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, but I think she just said that.  To hurt you.  I don't know.  I have to encourage him.  Then you're thinking about.  I don't know.  Well, if I take what money I have left out and put it somewhere.  Oh, you started thinking about finances and ditching some of them.  Can you say that I gambled it all away?  Uh, hmm.  You, you'd have to.  You, you've got to ditch your money well before a divorce is even, like, in the, you've got  to have a whole separate thing that's completely away from everything.  Yeah, start burying money now.  So before your divorce, what do you do? 
[02:46:00]  You've got to start, you've got to start, you've got to start ditching money when you're  happily married.  Guys, guys, if you're listening out there.  Because the second shit starts going down, there is an accounting of every fucking penny  you have, everything you own, everything.  Every penny per second per second.  But isn't the true stuff you had before you got married is yours?  No.  Oh, yeah.  The second you get married, the second you get married, it becomes a marital property.  It's both of yours.  Doesn't matter who the fuck brought it.  Doesn't matter.  Unless it's in, written in a prenup, everything is each of yours. 
[02:46:30]  And that all has to be doled out and fucking divvied up and everything.  Money, furniture, animals, whatever.  Golf clubs.  Golf clubs.  Everything.  She owes half your golf clubs.  Doesn't matter.  She owns half of everything you own right now.  I can send you back that shitty driver.  Yeah, when can I get that back?  You're going to have it back.  I don't see it around.  Because it's in two pieces.  You still don't believe me, but.  Well, then if it's in two pieces, then you've got to give me the $1,200 I paid for it. 
[02:47:00]  $1,200.  I'm fucking fixing that thing.  Jesus.  I just opt to price a little.  Why don't we go to break with a little backstage piece.  If you've seen the Jim Norton, Jesse Ventura Convertation video,  there was a guy named Jonathan is his name in the background the entire time creeping everybody out.  A lot of comments on him looking like a fat McLovin and whatnot.  Yeah.  If you've read the comments of the video.  Well, Sam went backstage to talk to intern Jonathan and why he was so happy to watch the confrontation go down. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  The Opie and Anthony Show made news when they put out the video of Jesse Ventura walking off the show.  But the real story behind the story was the Opie and Anthony Show's useless intern, Jonathan,  lingering in the frame of the video and distracting the viewers.  We first spoke to one of intern Jonathan's biggest critics, Club Soda Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny, did you see the Jesse Ventura video? 
[02:48:00]  Yes, sir.  Did you see our intern Jonathan inserting himself into the background?  That kid's a fucking hump.  Why do you say that?  Because that's what I said.  He's a fucking hump.  Do you think he added anything to the video?  Ugliness.  He's an attention-seeking hump.  Do you think that he put himself deliberately in the video?  That kid couldn't make a pimple on my ass. 
[02:48:30]  Thank you, Kenny.  We next found intern Jonathan and approached him with some of the questions that YouTube users left under the video after watching it.  Intern Jonathan, you made quite a splash with your appearance on the Jesse Ventura YouTube video recently.  How are you dealing with your new level of fame?  I'm trying to handle it with honor.  I mean, it's an honor to be on an Opie and Anthony video.  Well, I mean, the fans did notice. 
[02:49:00]  How do you respond to some of the criticisms and questions that the fans on YouTube have for you?  For instance, Follow Me Around says,  I can't take my eyes off of Fat McLovin laughing outside the studio.  At least they didn't mention the Batman hoodie.  Well, that's good that you mentioned that because WallAdam1 asks,  Who was the dummy in the Batman sweatshirt that kept showing his stupid face to the camera? 
[02:49:30]  I honestly wasn't even paying attention to the camera.  I just wanted to make it.  But to answer WallAdam's question, the dummy with the stupid face was you.  Oh, that was me.  That was 100% me.  How do you respond to Slate of Mike's question,  Who's the mongloid tarred in the Batman sweater?  That's me.  How about Gelhead's question,  By the way, who's the Fat McLovin in the background?  They really got this Fat McLovin thing going.  What to answer the question.  That would be me, intern Jonathan. 
[02:50:00]  How about the question Freakman here asks,  What's with the douche in the Batman hoodie?  I wish Jesse would punch him in his stupid AIDS infested face.  That would be, I don't know how to answer that.  I would say it's me, but that doesn't answer his question.  What's with you?  No, what's, well yeah, what's with you?  I was just excited to be there.  Do you think you'll be more conscious of the camera lens next time?  Every time from now on.  And the Batman hoodie?  Never again.  Well, Jonathan, I hope you've learned your lesson. 
[02:50:30]  Maybe intern Jonathan will stay so far away from the camera lens  that he doesn't come into the studio at all.  He'll probably get more done for the show that way.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts,  and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  Rich Voss' studio.  Let's all go see Rich Voss,  especially if you're in the area. 
[02:51:00]  If you can take a plane, Rich would really appreciate that,  but it's the Overlook Lodge, Route 9 West,  Bear Mountain, New York.  The website is visitbearmountain.com.  www.visitbearmountain.com.  All right, for Rich Voss, or richvoss.com.  It's far, Bear Mountain, it's like 40 minutes?  About an hour, maybe.  At the most, it's not that far.  It's an easy ride.  I really need about 400 people.  Huh?  You need 400?  We'll get you 400.  Give me that Carol lens. 
[02:51:30]  I want to plug something I forgot to plug,  because you mentioned Bella yesterday, Bella Donna.  Go to, I don't know where,  there's some Winter Wonderland thing on Saturday.  They're raffling off a date with her.  You can win a date with her,  and I don't know what that would entail.  I know what I would hope it would entail,  but just go to her Twitter,  enter Bella Donna, and find out.  She didn't ask me to plug it.  I just saw it, and I'm like,  I would like to win a date with her.  Who's Bella Donna?  Nobody heard that.  You're much the biggest porn star.  She is?  She's right up there.  Yeah, she's very, very cute. 
[02:52:00]  She's dirty.  Would you like to have sex with a porn star?  Wouldn't you be intimidated?  I've already fucked one.  Get out of here.  I mean, a girl.  Wouldn't you be intimidated?  Oh, wouldn't I?  You wouldn't?  You have fucked a porn star?  No.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fuck fucked a porn star.  Did she come?  No.  Did you try to make her come?  I was fucking, I was in.  No.  I just tried not to make her laugh.  I was like, well, just do your act. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, boss.  I was in Amsterdam.  What did we do to you today that you're doing that?  I was in Amsterdam, and I was in a fucking, I'm with this hooker.  And, and like, she was so fucking hot.  I go in there, she cleans my balls, cleans my dick off, which didn't take long.  And I'm fucking her.  That made you come, right?  Oh, it could have.  But I'm fucking her.  And I swear to God, I'm going, and she's going, oh, oh.  She's really getting into it.  And I'm going, I'm going to make a fucking, a prostitute come.  You know, I'm like, that's almost impossible. 
[02:53:00]  Then I turn her around, and I'm fucking her from behind, and she's like really going nuts.  I'm going, this is the fucking greatest fuck I've ever had.  And then I'm going, she's going to come.  And within one second, she says, your time's almost up.  Right?  Oh, you thought you were fucking, she was digging you and everything.  She's a good actress.  Oh, fuck.  I'm digging this fucking Italian murderer chick.  What?  This Amanda Knox.  You think she did it?  She's yelling in trouble.  I don't give a shit. 
[02:53:30]  I would fucking, I'd be plowing that.  She's been in jail for two years.  Oh, she's guilty as sin, this one.  How long has she been in jail?  Two years.  Two years?  Over there in Italy.  And they're still trying to figure out what's going on with her?  Fuck yeah, she's a pretty brutal murderer.  What'd she do?  Fucking, what, she stabbed with some guy or some shit?  No, some other.  I don't even know the story.  Every time I see it, I'm just like, wow, that's a hot murderer.  It's a sex story.  Her and her boyfriend and another guy and a girl.  Yeah, it was like some kind of fucking jealousy thing going on.  I don't know if she did it. 
[02:54:00]  I don't know.  I think she's guilty.  It's hotter.  Look at her.  She kind of looks cute.  She's perfect for you.  I don't like her.  Perfect.  Fucking young murderer.  Ew.  They suck, Rich.  What was Rich looking at?  Some fucking Wendy Williams.  Oh, God.  Oh, Fox News broad.  She was cute.  She was all right.  There was also that other murdering mother.  What was that mother that murdered that fucking girl?  I think she had Anthony in her name or something. 
[02:54:30]  Was it her last name?  Oh, Kylie.  Oh, yeah.  Kylie?  I don't know.  Michelle Anthony or...  I don't know who it was.  Yeah, she was a hot, sicko murderer, too, kind of.  He just liked her because she didn't want kids around.  Exactly.  Good way to get rid of him.  Well, Rich had something.  Rich.  I forgot it.  Go ahead.  No, you were talking about hot girls.  You know, what the fuck?  When you're married...  I mean, your wife is beautiful.  Oh, God, why did I not fucking bring in your fucking thank you cards? 
[02:55:00]  Well, you couldn't even take the time to sign your fucking name.  You're not that important.  We were lucky to get them out of time.  I thought I was getting coupons from...  It's a thank you card for coming to my wedding.  You're supposed to at least put the name to you.  Yeah, but we panicked.  You're supposed to have them out before your year anniversary.  So, the day before our year anniversary, we FedExed them all out.  How long would it take to put on their opium hostage?  I had a whole pile.  Huh?  I had a whole fucking pile.  He just sent out cards.  It's like... 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, it was a nice picture.  It was the most imp...  Oh, really?  Like, we're going to hang them?  Who gives a fuck that's a picture?  I just want to acknowledge that you came to my wedding.  Nobody gives a fuck about pictures from your wedding.  All they want to hear is, thank you for getting me this.  Okay?  A little personal.  We didn't keep track of all the gifts that we got, so it puts us in a weird situation.  Well, we had a list.  My first wife and I, we kept a list.  Winner, loser, winner, loser.  We were too excited to be getting all this stuff, and we just went through it all without  writing shit down.  You did it like a Jew.  No, I... 
[02:56:00]  So...  We made the list.  Yeah, we made...  Yeah, you're...  Yeah, I'm not good at making lists.  Some people got out.  Yeah.  Some gifts we kept.  Some went to a camp.  Some guys.  I was so fucking impersonal.  I got this card.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  I'll take you to dinner or something.  Lighten up.  What do you mean, lighten up?  Rich takes...  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Rich takes weddings very seriously because of what happened to him.  Thank you, Carson, for coming to her birthday party.  I don't send them. 
[02:56:30]  Somebody else does.  Thank you for showing up to her graduation.  Keith and Ange would send them out.  I don't have to do anything.  Yeah, but you sign them.  Don't you sign them?  No, no.  Keith has a stamp and just...  He stamps everything.  Like Caligula.  Yeah, that's it.  Name the people of Rome.  All right.  I'm just wondering.  You know, I thought maybe...  We did what we could.  We did write in some of the cards, by the way.  I swear to God.  Jesus.  Not yours.  What do you know about him? 
[02:57:00]  Club Soda Kenny got a little note in his.  I didn't even get a card.  You should have.  Dear Big Oaf.  Dear Dumbbell.  Jimmy, you should have got a card.  Are you kidding?  I don't think I got one.  Why?  You probably thought it was junk mail.  It's all right.  No, I would have fucking...  Mope and Lindsay.  I would have known.  You should have got it around Thanksgiving.  Hmm.  No.  Unless I didn't open it yet.  Maybe I got...  Somehow I technically didn't get you to open.  Yours had a little note, too.  Ooh.  Sorry, Rich.  Maybe I should have gave you a note.  Yeah, man. 
[02:57:30]  No, I don't even care about the note.  Just...  I wasn't sure if you were at the wedding.  I just...  If you want to know the truth.  Yeah, I was.  I got to have some of your free candy that you gave to people.  That was the best money I've ever had.  The best candy table, right?  Yeah.  Little baby Jimmy running up to the candy and just shoving it in a huge bag.  You should...  I was fucking elbowing kids out of the way.  You knocked them out of the way.  Yeah, I saw that.  It was on video.  There was no guy handing it through a car window?  What do you mean?  Yeah, what's that?  I know what you mean.  The candy.  I got it.  I know you did. 
[02:58:00]  See, everyone else is saying they just gang emailed...  One guy goes, fuck that.  I gang emailed mine.  My thank yous.  Really?  Ticky Punchcock.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We're just...  I mean, we're old-fashioned and have class, you know.  We just said thank you to people.  You have class?  Yeah.  Holding a grudge because we didn't go to the wedding.  Not at all.  I just thought it was funny.  I didn't know it was a wedding.  I don't know how many times I have to tell you.  What?  Yours.  No, no, yours.  That sermon thing.  I'm not talking about mine.  I'm talking about yours.  Opie.  You only got four letters to sign. 
[02:58:30]  No.  Oh, you wanted me to just sign it that way?  As long as you sign it so we knew that you looked at...  That you know, oh, this one's going to this person.  Ask him for an autograph.  I fucking licked the envelope.  So you got a little DNA there.  Enjoy it.  Enjoy my DNA.  You fuck?  I hate you.  You hate me?  Oh, God.  Hush now, Rich.  Embarrassing yourself.  Hush now.  All right.  What else do we got going on?  The homeless shopping spree.  We had two homeless guys in today.  Very good.  Yes.  Stars in the making. 
[02:59:00]  We'll do the headlines here.  Twitter account OAHSS if you want to follow the homeless shopping spree with us this year.  But it goes down December 17th.  And we're looking for a big crowd.  We want to show off a little bit to this new company, Sirius XM.  So hopefully we'll get a big crowd when the homeless go shopping on the 17th.  Yeah.  A mall outside of New York City in Jersey.  An easy ride from Manhattan.  What?  The last one was great, man.  You were at 2006?  I was at the last...  That's the last one, believe it or not.  Three years ago.  At Short Hills.  Oh, that was the first one. 
[02:59:30]  They were...  Huh?  I think that was the first one.  Oh, no.  Then we went back to Short Hills, right?  I was there and then we did one in Long Island.  How many did we do all together?  Three or four?  Did we do one in Long Island?  Yeah, Roosevelt.  Yeah, Roosevelt Field.  But Short Hills was the best because those upper-end stores were locking doors and stuff.  Yeah, they were angry.  You know, and it was just regular, you know, black people going to the store, but they were  locking them, thinking they were with us.  Jesus.  Jesus, Rich.  What are you talking about?  Boss is funny, man. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  You are funny, Rich.  He's just a jerk.  You have a lot of tradition.  It's weird.  What's that?  I didn't think you had so much tradition in you.  He doesn't.  Yes, I do.  He wants thank you cards done right.  Yeah, we do that.  We did everything within a year, and we did them right away.  You know, we do things the way you're supposed to.  You actually brought a gift to the wedding, which was nice.  A nice gift.  Yeah, very nice.  Fucking.  What was it?  I'm sure when it hit the bottom of your garbage bin, it made a look. 
[03:00:30]  I'll be completely honest with you.  Where'd you get me, and I'll tell you where it is.  Let's play that.  They were extremely expensive candle holders, I think.  If I can remember back that far.  I think they were very.  Candle holders?  They were beautiful.  Yeah.  Who got married?  Fucking Dracula?  Oh, my.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  You could have gave them to somebody.  I gave them to my cousin.  He got married.  Oh, damn.  You gave our present? 
[03:01:00]  You regifted our present?  Yeah.  What was he going to do with candle holders?  Oh, I don't know.  Candles on them.  Murder somebody.  They usually use.  Yeah.  Candle murder.  And a Colonel monster.  He had the old school fucking candle holders, where you have to find the long candles.  This is a ghoul.  No, they wouldn't.  Listen.  No one's fucking.  Fucking candelabra.  Who wants that?  Yeah.  Candles are now big and big.  Who got married?  The Phantom?  It was a menorah, probably. 
[03:01:30]  It's a candle holder.  It's a morana.  My cousin sent me a really nice thank you for those candle holders.  What'd you do?  You probably gave my golf club away, too, to your foot.  No, I still got that, but it is in two pieces.  That's no joke.  CNN just popped up the Jesse Ventura freaking Jim Norton clip.  It's a front page on Breitbart TV.  Oh, Breitbart.  Comedian Jim Norton talks about confrontation with Jesse Ventura.  What's the CNN logo?  Let's see.  Where's it from?  I think that was just an ad. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, no.  You know, look at it.  Why is there a CNN logo?  Oh, that's probably when I talk to Joy Behar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do they show the Joy from last night?  Oh, it talks about the episode, right.  I taped this last night, but I did panel, and I did a one-on-one segment with her.  How was Joy?  She was great.  Oh, she goes, I heard you guys talk about me on the show sometimes.  Are you nice?  I'm like, yeah, because she's a comic, so we usually defend Joy.  I love her.  She always defends comedians. 
[03:02:30]  She's a comic.  Then when you expect her to say the right thing on The View, she doesn't, so I get confused  by her, to be completely honest with you.  I'm looking for, here he is, storming off.  You are a hairdo.  You're bigger than me and stronger than me.  So what?  I don't give a s***.  You're going to beat me up?  Go ahead.  I'm not going to fight a guy like you.  That means nothing to me.  Well, that was a smackdown between comedian Jim Norton and former Minnesota governor and  wrestler, on my head, Jesse Ventura, that happened during an interview on the O.P. 
[03:03:00]  and Anthony show.  Come with me now to talk about that and a few other things.  It's very funny and apparently very brave comedian Jim Norton.  Hi.  Hi, Jim.  So what happened between the two of you?  I thought you were lovers.  Well, that was, well, no, no.  We met in a rest area once.  No, that was actually the end of a one-hour interview on O.P. and Anthony.  It was the third time we had Jesse on.  It wasn't like I just attacked Jesse Ventura.  He's a tough guy to kind of go back and forth with because he's a dominant alpha male.  Yes, he is. 
[03:03:30]  If you disagree, hey, it's like, I don't know about that.  What would you want your government to do?  Like, he's a very, very overpowering guy.  Yeah, he's in your face.  So when you start jumping in aggressively, it becomes aggressive.  So the interview went, the first time we interviewed him at KROQ a few years ago, he got so mad at me.  He was sitting there and he just pushed the microphone away from himself.  And he goes, all right, fine, you talk.  I'll just sit here.  You did him very well.  He does talk like that.  Thank you.  That was exactly what he, he rocks a lot, too.  It's really frightening.  But were you afraid he was going to hit you?  Yesterday, I was because it got so heated at the very end. 
[03:04:00]  He got up and the reason I insulted him like that was because, you know, he had cursed at me.  I had cursed at him.  And then he patted me.  He goes, all right, well, thanks for your patriotism.  And he patted me.  And when he touched me, it's like that raises it because I'm not going to get up and touch him back.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not stupid.  I mean, I'm going to put it off on a microphone, but I'm not going to challenge an ex-wrestler.  He would have punted me through the wall.  Exactly.  Well, he's a lot older than you, though.  You might have been able to take him.  He's an older gentleman.  Hopefully, he'd have a Viagra heart attack, but there's nothing else I can do to kick him back. 
[03:04:30]  So I just insulted him.  But people made more out of it.  It was like, look, we're both guys.  We had a fight.  He's a combative guy.  I'm a combative guy.  I'm glad he didn't punch me in the face.  Boy, that is something.  But he did get uncomfortable.  I'm not that brave where I would have met him in an alley to fist fight him, but I really did think that he was going to strike me.  But it was really kind of interesting television I just watched.  So you're going to put it in your stand-up act?  You're going to do anything with it?  Yeah, people will probably shout it out because the fans tend to yell out stuff that's happened on the radio show.  So, yeah, I mean, I'll talk about it if people want me to.  But I'm not even going to trash him.  I still like him. 
[03:05:00]  Okay.  There you go.  Fucking A.  Good little job there.  Holy shit.  CNN.  CNN Headline News with Joy Behar.  When does that run?  Tonight?  Or did that run last night?  Did it run last night?  Oh, it ran already?  It was supposed to run tonight.  Oh, maybe.  But she might have run it last night because if they have it on B.I.Bart.TV, maybe it ran last night.  Because Levy texted me.  Crazy fucking Levy.  Who is unraveling mentally for the last decade. 
[03:05:30]  Bob is insane.  But he texted me.  He goes, great job.  I wasn't sure if he saw the O'Reilly clip.  So I'm thinking he saw the Joy clip.  Yeah, that's solid right there.  Yeah, she was great.  It's been all over the place, man.  Jesus.  Right.  That got on O'Reilly?  They did.  He didn't mention it.  He's not really great at plugging my name, but he did show the clip.  Uh-huh.  And then, yeah, it's been all over the place.  I need something like that to boost my career.  I've got to be in the studio when there's controversy like that just to get my faith.  It's a good thing you had the camera running.  You know what I mean?  It's one of those things. 
[03:06:00]  The camera should run throughout the entire interview regardless of who it is or what's happening.  Yeah, we'd never know.  From now on, that has to be a rule.  We thought there might be a confrontation or a problem, and then that passed us by,  so then we just all put our cameras down, and then fucking we turned that camera on  literally 20 seconds before the confrontation.  We just locked out.  Sam's camera work with the Zoom.  The Zoom was...  That was key, when he Zoomed up on Jesse's face, and Jesse's just staring like a fucking  caveman at you. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  Well, you know what?  There's men of similar ilk.  Yeah?  What?  You know, tough guys.  We look at each other.  Oh, sure.  I love these guys that post, and I don't care about the haters, I'm bothered, but it's  like when I hear stuff like, dude, I wish, you know, you should have got his ass kicked  for y'all and a guy that size.  Really?  Yeah, why?  It's almost like, really?  Yeah, why?  But for arguing with a bigger guy, you fucking pussy, shut up.  Bigger guy, always right.  Ugh.  That sounds correct.  Norton smashed the one. 
[03:07:00]  I listened to when you said stuff about World War II, there was no internet and all that  stuff when he brought up Hitler.  Oh, just the availability of the immediacy of information?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just...  I was fucking...  I was very impressed.  It was like, think how efficient they could have been with an internet.  What's that?  Think how efficient they could have been with the internet.  The Nazis.  Oh, hold on.  I'm talking.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  You actually did the Hitler salute.  What's wrong with you, Rich?  You're a horrible Jew.  Wow.  You are the worst Jew ever.  I was telling you, I was going like that for a second.  I was telling you, you know...  Really? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, were you?  Read the hand face.  Use the proper arm if you're going to do that.  Maybe I'm a gay Nazi.  Jesus.  You do it with the left arm, you're a gay Nazi?  Come on.  That's why you got to go see Rich.  I mean, you're going to get some quality stuff from him.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Rich Voss, Overlook Lodge, Route 9 West, Bear Mountain, New York.  RichVoss.com, Rich Voss on Twitter.  Are you doing De Niro?  Now, I'm doing Jesse.  Look at the Jesse look. 
[03:08:00]  That's the guy that wanted fucking to hit somebody.  He was biting his lip right there.  He's going like, yeah, yeah.  Look how he looks at Jimmy.  That look he gave him was, I would love to punch your face in.  That is, I really would love to punch your face in.  How was he elected?  When he was elected, he had the shaved head and the mustache, and he sounded semi-reasonable.  Now, he just riff-raff-haired him.  And just like a lunatic. 
[03:08:30]  And by the way, I think most of them aren't listeners.  Like, whenever I get emails or MySpaces from guys who are veterans, and like, oh, actually, most military guys sided with me.  Honestly, 85% to 90% of all emails I've gotten that were military, completely.  But the ones that didn't, and quote, I'm in the military.  Fuck you.  I'm very pro-military.  I'm a civilian.  I went to Iraq for free and put myself in a war zone to entertain troops. 
[03:09:00]  I love the fucking military.  But don't tell me I can't argue with a guy who was in the military.  Yeah, what?  You're not allowed.  Dude, it was so funny.  I saw one link that said, liberal comic Jim Norton.  I'm like, oh, boy.  What?  Wow, do you have it wrong.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that picture of him there.  See?  That's what he looked like when he was in office.  He looks like a normal guy.  He's not a dumb guy.  He's just nutty.  He's kooky.  He's a kook.  All right. 
[03:09:30]  Jimmy, have fun at Caroline's.  Oh, yeah.  Tickets for tonight.  If you call up after we're off the air, two pairs for each show tonight only.  All right.  If you want to come, it would be great to have you.  Well, it's been a hell of a week, guys.  Thanks for the support.  Really, hasn't it?  Yes.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Bye.  Who knows what will happen next week.  Yeah, if I don't show up, if I'm fired here, listeners, thank you.  Oh, God.  Oh.  I'm available.  You could say that any night of the week.  New Year's Eve. 
[03:10:00]  Well, check out a short list.  What's that?  You're third on the short list.  I'm not third.  You're third.  If I'm not fucking certain, the only person I can see are two people that should be in front of me.  Yeah, so that means you're third.  And Billy won't do it.  You're third.  And Patrice won't get up that early.  You're third.  I wouldn't even try that.  I wouldn't want to be the fourth guy.  You're third.  Who would be?  On the short list.  Fucking been killing lately here.  Paul Macerio, number one. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Mike Dina Cole, the number one.  Mike Dina Cole.  Wow.  Who's clawing his way to becoming an unknown.  And the sleepwalking guy is third.  Oh, my goodness.  And Paul Bond's guitar is fourth.  Jesus.  Wow, that's way inside, but really good.  I hope the old listeners enjoy that one.  How many of you hasn't smelled in a week?  Okay, then you've got to get my ear.  No.  Yes, I'll do your belly button, you'll do my ear.  Yeah, that's fair.  Danny will do your ear.  Hold on.  I've done it already.  No, you know what?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:11:00]  Get E-Rock.  Not the right one, not the left one.  Get E-Rock.  The right one.  The right one.  The right one.  The right one.  This is how we end a week of fine radio.  He smells Jimmy's belly button and smells Rich Voss' ear.  Before it goes away.  Do you know what it smells like?  No, no, no, no, no.  Get the mic.  Hold on, hold on.  I've got to.  Hold on.  Before the juiciness goes.  Ew.  All right, I'm back.  Ew, the juiciness.  Hold on.  Hold on, I'm going over there.  Let me know which is worth.  Worth?  Worth.  You tell us the keys quickly. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Which is worth?  Here we go.  All right, wait, wait.  Here we go.  Let me set this up.  I hope he's up.  E-Rock is going to smell Jim Norton's belly button and Rich Voss' ear to see which one smells  is worse.  Here's Jimmy and the belly button.  Wait, let him clear out.  What does it smell like?  E-Rock?  Oh, it's B.O. and cum again.  Again.  He's like, oh, it's B.O. and cum again.  All right, I have to decide what is worse than Rich Voss and what he has going on behind  in his ear.  Oh, Voss has a big hunk. 
[03:12:00]  I can tell.  Oh, Voss has a kind of cyst.  Oh, put him right down on the floor.  It's putting E-Rock right down on the floor.  Oh, the winner.  The winner.  Voss, Gax, get the fuck away from me.  Get away.  Hey, Keith, you want to take some?  Yeah, I take a little Voss' ear. 
[03:12:30]  No.  He won't.  No.  Do a little more just to make sure.  I think I'm losing it.  Wait, get one of the interns in here.  One more.  One more.  Get a new guy.  Get a new guy.  All right, new guy.  Quick while it's still juicy.  Rich is gagging.  Graham.  Graham wants to be here.  Graham, get up and smell it.  Really.  Nah, I'm out.  Just take his ear.  Come on.  Just smell this.  Oh, my God.  It's like old fucking cheese.  Like old fucking cheese. 
[03:13:00]  I don't even have a fan anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  It wore off.  Do it to the Rocky game.  No, I don't have any.  Oh, you do have more, you think.  Oh, fuck it.  Oh, he's smearing some kind of shit on the table.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Just the worst personal life.  Watch it.  Thank you.  The reaction of the audience.  The overlook.  Let me rock smell it again. 
[03:13:30]  It's gone.  Shut up.  Let me rock.  Think more.  I can't create fucking.  You can say stop right there.  What?  Stop right there.  Stop right there.  Stop right there.  Give me some more.  I don't have any more.  See, make, let him be.  Show us your cock.  What?  Jesus Christ.  Show us your cock.  Get some more.  You might have some more.  All right, can we go home now?  Yeah.  There's nothing there.  Try it again, you're on. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, now that's.  You're kind of rumbling.  All right.  Is it bad, you're on?  He wants cheesecake now.  Was it worse than his?  Oh, it was much worse.  You're disgusting.  There you go.  All right.  Hit the spots.  We're out of here. </pre>
