<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, starting with Opie's lavish experience at Dominique Ansel Bakery, where he received numerous complimentary pastries from the owner himself despite already purchasing items.  The hosts then dissected the excessive sweetness of the treats.  The conversation shifted to a video of a physical altercation between a New York Jets fan (with a prior manslaughter conviction) and a Patriots fan at a game, leading to a debate on the appropriateness of the punch and the subsequent legal ramifications, including the Jets fan's stadium ban.

Next, the show delved into the antics of a Twitter user claiming to be "Lady Di," highlighting her struggles with the platform and the hosts' humorous reactions, along with discussions of a parody Mike Francesa Twitter account and Francesa's furious response, including threats to expose the account's creators.  The hosts also mentioned upcoming events and the start of the World Series.

A phone interview with Mike Francesa followed, where the hosts teased him about on-air incidents (a Diet Coke spill, allegedly CGI, and ice cream consumption). Francesa vehemently denied the spill and angrily addressed the fake Twitter account, boasting about his career and connections. He then abruptly ended the call.  The hosts speculated about their workplace being sold due to renovations.  Listener calls ensued, including a dubious tale about a landlord masturbating his dog, and a soldier's account of witnessing bestiality in Iraq.  A significant portion focused on a listener's aggressive cat, Bear, its behavior post-neutering, and the owner's girlfriend's bizarre claim of using her nose to stimulate the cat. A cat behaviorist was interviewed by phone, offering advice and a later follow-up showing improvement.

The show then discussed a listener's aggressive cat in more detail with a remote cat behaviorist, including graphic descriptions of the cat's actions and the owner's attempts to manage them. The behaviorist provided advice. The discussion then veered to a listener's story about Godzilla roars in a commercial, leading to a discussion about Godzilla films, Blue Oyster Cult, a caller falsely claiming his son's band surpassed Blue Oyster Cult in accolades, and a false claim about serial killer Joel Rifkin allegedly being a guitarist for the band.  Poker and a listener's engagement announcement (dismissed by the hosts) concluded this segment.  The segment was peppered with crude and offensive language.

A substantial portion focused on the New York City mayoral race between Bill de Blasio and Joe Lhota, with the hosts offering vulgar and sexually explicit commentary, criticizing de Blasio's use of his children in campaign ads and Lhota's stance on stop-and-frisk.  They also touched on Weird Al Yankovic's birthday, a caller's band, a Boston mayor's gaffe, Shepard Smith's alleged behavior (as reported by Gawker), their dislike of Billy Crystal, a missed 30 for 30 documentary, Prep Burger bits (including Obama and Travolta impressions), and bits from a Canadian radio station featuring a dog named Stanley.

The show continued with mocking a poorly executed radio bit with a dog translator and transitioned to poorly executed PSAs, particularly one about inconsiderate parking.  They criticized radio stations relying on celebrity endorsements to compensate for weak personalities, using Z100 and 92.3 Now as examples.  A "Jacktober" segment played snippets of poorly conceived rally songs for the St. Louis Cardinals and Red Sox.  A commercial for Russell Peters' Netflix special was aired, and the hosts briefly mentioned “homeless mustard” before moving to a lengthy discussion with DJ Who Kid about the 30 for 30 documentary on John Spano and various other fraudulent schemes. This led to a humorous segment about Who Kid's attempts to invite Fez from the Ron and Fez show to a nightclub, resulting in a playful, argumentative exchange. A commercial for Artie Lange's book was also aired.

The broadcast concluded with a discussion of a feud with "Ron and Fez,"  mentioning a "Sicilian thing," and a challenge to respond to Opie's comments.  DJ Hook's presence in the studio was noted, along with promotion of the show's Facebook page and air times.  The hosts then signed off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Thank you.  How can I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  It's not fun.  That's it.  Just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sitting around.  Let's do it.  It's going down.  Jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM  satellite radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  I want dick crisis.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it? 
[00:01:00]  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Hello.  Hello.  Brain is over, kind of hard.  Hello.  Kind of hard.  Hello.  Hello.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Happy Havda.  Ho-ho.  Happy Havda.  Ho-ho.  Yeah.  Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.  Morning, everyone.  Hi, everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  Everybody.  I was thinking of Norton yesterday.  The Norton bombsite? 
[00:02:00]  World War II joke.  Very nice.  Not the joke part.  I went down to the home of the Cronut yesterday.  Oh.  And I was thinking the whole time, what would Jimmy do?  Because you're trying to eat right as well.  It's hard, man.  I fucking failed miserably yesterday.  The Obster failed miserably.  I went to my favorite sushi joint in all of New York City, Yasuda.  I highly recommend anyone who likes sushi, go down to Yasuda. 
[00:02:30]  Thanks to Anthony Bourdain.  Hey.  It's his recommendation, not mine.  I'm just passing along.  What the fuck do I know?  I'm not a foodie.  I just asked the guy one day, where's the best sushi?  And he told me.  And I've been there fucking four or five times now.  And now I can't eat sushi anywhere else.  He ruined it for you.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Damn.  You notice all the shitty sushi out there after you go to a real joint.  Yeah.  So we eat all nice.  And then I set up a roll. 
[00:03:00]  And I'm like, I want to go to the home of the Cronut.  For a little dessert.  Wow.  It was my wife's birthday yesterday.  That's a bold move.  That's like getting a fucking table at Dorsia.  At this point.  Very nice.  Oh, you eat in that?  I thought that bakery was just takeout.  Can you sit there and eat?  Well, that's why I asked Rollin.  Maybe I shouldn't be telling you this, Jimmy.  Because I'm sure you'll be bringing a young lady down there in the near future.  Or a reasonable spot.  That's a nice spot.  That's a family thereof.  Assembly not required. 
[00:03:30]  A girl with a peck up.  Right, Chimpa?  Fuck.  I didn't miss that.  So Rollin sets it up.  I go, Rollin.  And I swear.  I go, Rollin.  I don't need anything special.  I just want the guy to know I'm coming.  Because I know the joint is hot.  Right.  And it's my wife's birthday.  And I decide that's where we're going to go for a little dessert.  I just want a seat.  Right.  So if the guy could just make sure there's some. 
[00:04:00]  I didn't even ask for a good seat.  Just make sure.  Get a seat.  If we show up.  Because we're going way out of our way.  That I could at least sit.  And have a little fucking dessert.  And then just be treated like a regular Joe.  I swear.  Exactly.  That's key to the story.  So we show up.  It's on Spring Street, by the way.  Because people were asking.  189 Spring Street.  It's Dominic Ansell's bakery.  The home of the Cronut.  Of course, the Cronuts are sold out.  Like really early in the morning.  But he has so much other shit there. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  That who gives a fuck about the Cronut after a while.  But everyone comes in all day long.  Going, well, can I get a Cronut?  And they have to say over and over again.  No, they sell out.  It's the iPhone.  Right.  But the guy.  He's smart, though.  He could so make more Cronuts.  Of course he can.  I've been in his joint now.  He's got a lot of people working there.  It's the hype.  And there's a whole basement area.  Really?  I don't know what the fuck goes on in the basement.  But he's down there like a mad scientist.  Cronuts, they're made of people.  What's going on down there?  Soylent green shit. 
[00:05:00]  Something's going on.  Yeah.  I have no doubt in my mind.  The guy could easily make way more Cronuts.  And every single one would taste really, really good.  But he's smart.  Because now he's known as the place where the Cronuts sell out really fast.  So get there early.  Limited edition.  And he gets to have that line every morning.  Uh-huh.  So we show up.  Hype.  We order a few things and a couple coffee drinks.  And there's a nice outdoor garden area.  Ooh.  So we pay.  I need to let people know we paid. 
[00:05:30]  And we got like four things.  Two little things each.  I saw the pictures.  No.  That's not what I bought.  Oh.  That's the key to the story.  Oh, no.  So then Dominic pops his head up.  I go, hey, Dominic.  You know, Opie.  He goes, yeah, Roland told me you were coming.  Like, this guy is like known around the world now.  And, you know, he knows Roland.  I don't know.  The dommer.  Always with the donuts.  The dommer.  So then he goes, are you guys sitting out back?  I'm like, yeah. 
[00:06:00]  He goes, I'm going to like bring out some things.  I'm like, no, we ordered.  I go, we ordered.  We paid.  We're good.  He goes, what did you order?  And I told him.  He goes, ah, nah, nah, nah.  I want to give you some other stuff to try.  So then he comes out with a whole fucking tray of shit that I guess you saw on my Instagram.  Yeah, yeah.  That just looked like, oh, my God.  How do you eat that?  Look at all that.  That's not even the stuff we ordered.  Looks very sweet.  That's not even the stuff we ordered.  It's not like a restaurant where he can bring out like food food, regular food. 
[00:06:30]  You can't eat that much sweet shit.  There's one, two, three, four, wait.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  That's seven desserts.  And we ordered four ourselves.  There were 11 desserts on the table.  So that's when I was thinking to myself, what would Jimmy do?  You wouldn't be able to fucking control yourself, right?  But then you can't insult him by leaving it on the table.  That's...  But he did say, look, I understand.  I just gave you a shitload of desserts.  So, you know, get a box on your way out and take some of this home. 
[00:07:00]  Just take a bite of each one to see what they taste like.  Take a bite?  Right to my thighs.  You see the windmill-y shit thing?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't mean to use shit because everything was amazing.  That's some kind of sweet potato dessert.  That was ridiculous.  That sounds insane.  And then you see the little caramelly thing?  Yeah, what is that?  To the left?  That's an apple.  Get the fuck out of here.  Dude, with some kind of, like, really nice, like, jelly, gelatin thing glazed over the  whole top of it.  It looks goddamned good. 
[00:07:30]  What's that behind the apple thing?  Like, on the other plate?  Which one?  On the left?  Behind it.  On the left?  Yeah.  All the way to the left?  On that plate up above the apple thing.  Well, let me go around the horn there.  So then you got the plum slash berry tart thing.  That was ridiculous.  Then you go all the way to the left?  That's a s'mores.  Oh, really?  The old chocolate marshmallow gray ham cracker?  Here's his twist.  Inside?  Uh-oh.  Fucking ice cream.  Oh, that makes it perfect. 
[00:08:00]  Not melty ice cream, either.  Damn.  Fucking perfect cold ice cream in the middle of that marshmallow mess.  Who thought that would be good?  And then the thing, it's not presented right.  It's on its head like a dud.  Uh-huh.  Like a dunderhead.  That's called the DWA.  He says that's his favorite at the place.  And it's a caramelized croissant.  Oh, fuck.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:08:30]  And then those are some kind of buttery cookie things in the background.  And then we ordered a couple things that aren't in the picture.  You can't fucking eat.  Your fucking pancreas would come out of your asshole.  Dude, I'm still...  That's crazy.  Look, I'm still shaking from the sugar because I haven't eaten that much sugar in months.  Wow.  What would you have done, Jim?  I'll tell you exactly.  I went to a place for Roland.  It was an Italian place.  And it was really good.  I ate chicken parm.  And I was going to have a little bit of dessert.  But I'm like, maybe I'm going to have some fruit. 
[00:09:00]  The guy...  Have the veal.  It's the best in the city.  Yeah, I was hoping to get shot in the throat while enjoying my appetizer.  And then they brought out a dessert.  Because I guess...  Roland made the reservation for me.  Right.  And they came out and they brought me a place on Mulberry Street.  And they brought me a dessert.  And it was a few things.  Just like that.  Mixed.  And fucking really good.  So what I did was I had a couple of bites.  And the person I was with didn't really eat sweets.  She just was not a sweet eater.  So I had maybe two or three little things. 
[00:09:30]  And then I said, fuck it.  I brought the rest in for the crew here.  I'm like, I can't waste it.  So I had it boxed up.  And I said, you know...  Yeah, we can take it home with you.  I gave it to the guy.  I rubbed my cock on it.  And I gave it to the guy.  We destroyed that.  Destroyed it.  We took maybe half of it home.  But we tried everything.  It was ridiculous.  And this isn't plug-ola.  Because you get the Twitter assholes.  He's not paying me money.  He doesn't need us to even talk about it. 
[00:10:00]  But it's my experience.  I went there.  And you can see why he was voted like the fourth best pastry chef in the world or something.  This stuff is ridiculous.  Well, it's just a number at that point, I think, right?  I don't eat below the top three.  But I mean, for you, it's true.  You're going to slum it.  That looks really fucking tasty, I got to say.  See, my whole thing is if I avoid sugar, I'm good.  But you put it in front of me like that.  There's no fucking way I'm going to say no.  You can't say no to that.  That's a drug right there. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's like a pile of Coke if you're fucking back in the 80s in a Coke head.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you try to avoid the Coke.  But if all of a sudden you're at a party and it's laying on a fucking table in a pile,  at that point, you're fucked.  You're doing it.  And the owner comes out.  But then again, you went to the Coke store.  Yeah, I went to the dealer.  I'll just have some chopped up flour.  But then he brought out a fucking mirror with the good stuff on it.  That's true.  That is true.  It's hard.  That's just something we were talking about last night.  And somebody said sugar is harder to fucking not do than drugs. 
[00:11:00]  It's hard to not eat fucking sugar, man.  It's amazing.  Love sugar.  You just feel your fists start clenching when you have too much sugar.  It is tasty.  It was 11.30.  I'm wide awake just going, fuck, when is this sugar like in a drop?  What time did you eat it?  Early, like five.  You know, fucking Rob Bartlett, when he was over at my house for that party during the  summer, he brought Cokes, bottles of Coke that were, I guess, made in Mexico or something.  And it's got sugar in it. 
[00:11:30]  It's not that fucking corn syrup, whatever, high fructose corn syrup or anything.  It's just sugar.  Right.  It's made with real sugar.  Fucking, you could tell the difference.  Is it good?  Yeah.  And it's so ultra carbonated, it feels like your throat's going to just burn out of your  fucking neck when you drink it.  It's so goddamn good.  It's so much better.  So why don't they have that in America?  You know, it's, I guess, cheaper to get a big tanker truck full of that corn syrup shit  than it is to use cane sugar.  I'm going to be somewhere today where there's going to be some, probably some sweets. 
[00:12:00]  I brought, I'm such an old lady, I brought in my fucking bag one of those Quest bars.  Because it's like, you know, they're, they have like one gram of sugar.  They're not bad.  But I'm like, I got to eat something.  I can't watch everybody eating fucking donuts and cookies on a set.  Oh my God.  Right.  So I'll just sneak off and chew this in the fucking bathroom and not tell anyone.  Act like I'm a tough guy eating cookies.  Thanks to the listener that sent in the classic crumb coffee cake that me and Anthony talk  about a lot.  Classic crumb coffee cake.  It doesn't roll off the tongue right. 
[00:12:30]  You picked the wrong day to mail this in.  After yesterday, that does not even look even close to appealing.  No.  Look at that.  It's just sitting there on the counter.  You had good cocaine last night and somebody mailed you a glad baggie full of crank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  It's nice of you to do.  But it's Dreester 21 on Twitter.  It looks like.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  Yeah.  Thanks.  We're not going to eat.  You know what?  Maybe, maybe Iraq will have some.  I don't know.  Oh my God.  He doesn't like sweets. 
[00:13:00]  Dominic Ansel is his name.  The creator of the cronut.  And he's got a good joint over there.  I don't think he's getting the, well, the place did very well while I was there.  So what am I going to say?  I don't think he's doing himself justice.  Because I think everyone thinks all he's doing is doing cronuts over there.  And no, man.  This other shit is just as, just as fucking good.  So.  I had a nice little hattie you do this morning.  Very quickly.  What happened?  My tunnel guy.  Yeah.  He's back on you?  Well, I was pulling up to the, to the gates over there at the Midtown Tunnel when I'm coming in. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  And, uh, I see him kind of look and he steps out into the lane and I stop and he comes to the side and I roll the window down and he just looks over at my Reggie and my fucking inspection, which is all nice and up to date.  And, uh, he goes, have a nice day.  I was like, thank you, sir.  Oh.  And then we just, I just drove off.  But he's still, he will not leave this alone.  They gotta let it go.  They got you. 
[00:14:00]  He's fucking, it's, it's fucking.  You got your shots in.  He got a little shot back.  Right, right.  It's before 6 a.m.  We'll just relax.  What's the matter with you?  Seriously?  Seriously.  They know when you're coming.  Oh, yeah, they know.  That guy loves just.  They're just so obsessed that they're just looking at license plates.  He's just gonna check my fucking, uh, well, the front of the escalator is pretty obvious, you know?  Right.  And, um, you know, you come through and he's just, he'll be there.  Dick.  Just fucking with me.  But I almost understand that cop's point of view. 
[00:14:30]  Oh.  Let's just, let's say you worked in a job, or let's just say where we are right now.  Uh-huh.  We knew a Twitter hater was gonna walk by the same time every day.  Exactly.  And you have a bucket of shit and you're allowed to throw some on him.  Right.  You have to every day.  That's it.  Just throw a little shit on him.  Well, just think about it.  If you're, you know, if you're, you wanted to be a cop your whole life.  And, and somehow you, you don't get on the NYPD.  And you're, uh, you're a tunnel cop.  You're, you're a bridge and tunnel cop.  Half the time, you're, not even half the time, one percent of the time you're doing what you 
[00:15:00]  wanted to do, enforcing the law.  Right.  The other times, you're pretty much like a grocery store, uh, cashier.  Right.  You're just taking people's money and, uh, you know, letting them through a toll booth.  You gotta let it go.  You gotta be a little, you gotta be a little angry at that.  You gotta let it go.  You gotta be a little angry that you're not a real policeman, that you're, you're taking  real cops.  Don't stand there and make change for people.  You know, they don't. 
[00:15:30]  They enforce the law.  They're, they're in the face of danger all the time.  It's not pretty much sucking in exhaust fumes and, uh, trying to break that 50.  With that said.  Yeah.  The guy obviously was looking for something wrong with your vehicle.  Oh yeah.  What if he decided to go old school and just like kick out a headlight or something in  front of you?  What would you have thought?  I'd have to laugh.  Would you laugh?  I'd have to chuckle.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good move.  A good one.  An old Southern sheriff fucking move from the 50s.  Good one.  Although poor, he watched Porky's. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  So, yeah.  What are you going to do?  Hey, was, um, Obama in town yesterday?  I was trying to drive my vehicle all over Manhattan and there was those fucking, um, those helicopters  in the air.  Yeah.  Those big impressive ones.  I don't know the fucking name of them.  Like the big double rotor.  The big, huge fucking thing over the East River.  What was that about?  Either Blackhawks or the fucking Chinook.  A Chinook.  Traffic was horrible.  Yeah?  Uh, was it over the Hudson? 
[00:16:30]  No, the East River.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, uh, I would get ready for some, um, 911 calls after 7 o'clock today because, uh, apparently  they're doing some thing.  They had this jet blue plane and it's painted red, like, uh, for a fire department, um, promotional  thing, I guess.  And they're going to be flying it at 2,000 feet over the Hudson River between the Verrazano  and, um, George Washington Bridge between 7 and 7.30 this morning.  Why?  Uh, promotional thing and photo op or something. 
[00:17:00]  So they, I guess they tweeted something yesterday.  It's the, there's the plane.  It's just going to fly from where to where?  It's going to fly between the, uh, Verrazano Bridge and the George Washington Bridge.  Fuck!  Uh.  Why not south of the GWB?  I would get a nice shower there.  Yeah, well.  No, it is south of the GWB.  It's between the Verrazano and, uh, GWB.  So it's going to be, um, between Brooklyn and, uh, and up in Manhattan.  Oh, Verrazano.  Yeah, not the Tappan Z.  I was thinking Tappan Z.  Okay.  Oh, fuck.  That's going to fly right by my window.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's high?  At 2,000 feet, which if you think about it. 
[00:17:30]  That's nothing.  It's probably the Trade Center height with the antenna was about two grand.  Yeah.  No, that's nothing.  So, uh, and, and you can never get the word out to everybody.  So there's going to be people.  There's a low flying plane!  There's a plane!  Oh, with the, with the antenna?  No, the Trade Center was probably 1,100 or 1,200 feet with the antenna.  I thought it was, uh, 1,600 or, uh, 1,300 and then another 600 with the antenna?  No, because right now the tallest building in North America is the tower, and that's 1776. 
[00:18:00]  1776, okay.  And that's a, that's a, it might have been, maybe, maybe it was 1,400 feet.  You might be closer.  What the fuck?  Well, we got a, internet's.  What was it?  Hmm.  110 stories.  Oh.  That's about 1,100 feet.  Ah.  So maybe 1,400 feet.  1,400.  With the, uh, tower.  I'm going to go higher than 1,400.  It might be like, right.  Yeah, it was, uh, 1727.  Oh, wow.  1727.  That's pretty fucking close to 2,000.  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:18:30]  And, and for people to see planes around New York City that low, it gets them very riled up.  When, uh, I guess the, I guess the Air Force One, a couple of years back, was doing a photo op,  and they were flying around, uh, the Statue of Liberty and Empire State.  How much did that cost us, by the way?  A boatload, I'm sure.  A boatload.  Remember that shit?  Yeah.  And people were freaking out.  And that was Air Force One.  Right.  That was a big red plane is going to be fucking.  They were doing something impressive.  Flying around.  Bank turns and shit.  Oh, yeah, it looked awesome, but there's never a way to get the word out to everybody. 
[00:19:00]  So people will, uh, there's a lot of people with apartments, uh, facing the, uh, Hudson  that are going to be like, oh, what the fuck is going on?  Right.  You see him flying, and it's like, oh, he's going to crash into something.  That's the only reason it could be that loud.  So, if you see it, take some pictures.  That'd be good.  Could be, uh, fucking cool.  Cool.  Everybody thinks I'm crazy, by the way.  About what?  I knew that.  This fucking, this guy is defending himself.  Oh. 
[00:19:30]  The chick is pretty hot, huh?  Oh, she hot.  What was your angle?  What was your angle on it?  We barely touched on it.  No, but, uh, we punched her.  It's tough to hit abroad.  It is, but.  Because a few people attacked me on Twitter, like, you know, you've got to understand the  situation.  You don't understand the situation.  It's just tough to hit abroad.  It is.  But they were, I think they punched him first.  He claimed self-defense.  But how about a, I mean, I could see if he pushed back.  Right.  Because she gave him a pretty good shove.  It was pretty impressive.  But I don't know.  You go to the punch, though.  Do you go to the punch? 
[00:20:00]  Well, other stuff led up to that, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're saying that she was charged.  Yeah.  How about a pushback?  If that would have been.  You think he should have hit her?  I don't know, but she got charged.  With what you know, I mean.  Yeah.  Now I do.  Because, obviously, if she was charged with something, they're looking to lock this  guy up.  That punch wasn't necessary, dude.  I can't.  I think they can't see as how that fucking punch that he gave.  He's a big guy.  And the father's even coming to his defense saying self-defense.  But if you look at the tape, yeah.  She's a girl.  It's like saying, look, if a fucking eight-year-old throws a punch at you, then you're justified 
[00:20:30]  to round off and fucking punch him right in the face.  You've got to take the threat as what it is.  If it's another guy, abso-fucking-lutely.  Even if another guy hits you or pushes you less than she did, you punch him in the face.  You've got to look and go, all right, it's a girl.  Yeah, it's technically self-defense.  A human being pushed me.  I should be able, as a human being, to get her back.  But it's a chick, dude.  What the fuck?  She was pretty aggressive.  As an asshole.  I think he could have handled it by giving her a push back. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  I would see that.  And what is she being charged with?  I think it's an embarrassment for the team, so they're making sure everyone is charged  with something.  Simple assault.  They want to feel like they've got their stadium under control.  It's simple assault and that, what is it when you make a fucking scene in public?  Yeah, it's a public deuce.  But it should encourage this guy's two friends were injured by the group, by the Patriots fans,  and as a result had to be hospitalized.  There was something else that happened.  We just don't know what it was.  Yeah, it was probably a huge brawl as they were making their way out of the place. 
[00:21:30]  That's why people started filming, obviously.  Disorderly conduct.  That's it.  Thank you.  But I was out of the loop yesterday.  I did see a headline that the guy killed somebody.  Yeah, back when he was 17.  Why is he walking around?  He was 17 at the time.  Did he do time?  Yeah, three years for manslaughter, I guess.  He stabbed another kid?  He stabbed some guy, yeah.  And he claimed self-defense then.  I guess his story was good.  Wow.  I don't know.  He said it was some white supremacist guy. 
[00:22:00]  Really?  And he stabbed him.  Yeah, his stories are all shaky.  His mother and father come right to his defense.  He's a good boy.  He's a typical Long Island douchebag.  There must have been witnesses that backed him up, though.  There's no way with a videotape that looks as terrible as this looks that they charge  her unless she really was fucking aggressive.  But he's got at least six or seven inches on her.  I can't see punching her.  He should have just put his hand on top of her head and let her swing at him and laughed  at her as she's trying to punch him.  That's always funny to do, right? 
[00:22:30]  Because it was an impressive punch.  Oh, yeah.  And she took it pretty well, too.  Also, banned from the stadium.  Nah, it's easy, though.  Banned from the stadium.  But it's not easy.  How do they figure that shit out?  He has the Jetsmobile.  Because they're never going to let the Jetsmobile back in the parking lot.  He's got a Jetsmobile?  Dude, please.  What?  He has...  I see that he's got a picture with Rex Ryan, so he's like...  He could possibly be the uber-fan white trash of Long Island.  Look at this thing.  Dude, he's got the Jetsmobile. 
[00:23:00]  I swear to you, I've seen that in the parking lot.  I've seen that.  Okay.  If you have the Jetsmobile and you're banned from the stadium, you're heartbroken.  Well, you kind of downplay it a little bit.  How do you drive that into the stadium?  You're like, lad, just get a Civic with a little Jets bumper sticker.  This guy's all about his giant tailgate parties.  I don't believe you could actually get banned.  I would love to take some phone calls.  I bet this guy can.  How?  How are they going to enforce it? 
[00:23:30]  If they know where your seat is, where they put your picture up, especially when you're in the parking lot.  Yeah, but you know all that, too.  So if you're still a huge fan, you go, all right, I got to change my fucking seats.  I got to, like, maybe grow a goatee or a beer.  But he's all about driving the Jetsmobile there.  If they see him in the parking lot.  All right, he's going to have to give up on the Jetsmobile.  No, that's the whole thing with him.  But he has to give up on that.  Tailgating with the Jetsmobile.  He can still watch Geno Smith and the boys.  The biggest fucking fan ever.  Look, he's got to give up the Jetsmobile.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  But maybe he could still get in there. 
[00:24:00]  His lawyer is actually trying to fight his banning so he can go to games.  That's probably hurting him a lot.  Fuck the assault.  He doesn't even care about the assault charge.  He doesn't want to be banned from the stadium.  I just want to know.  How do they enforce a banning?  I think it's almost impossible when 70,000, 80,000 people are showing up for a game.  I tend to agree with you.  If you want to get in, you've got your cool friends.  Like, okay, look, I'm banned, so let's all be cool.  But yeah, he can't ride his Jetsmobile anymore. 
[00:24:30]  And he's a season ticket holder, so he's going to lose those season tickets.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Season ticket holder.  I bet also if you're caught on the property, you get a trespassing charge thrown at you, too.  I'm not sure if he gets caught.  I don't know.  Weekend in jail, maybe?  With his previous record of fucking murder and assault.  Nah, he's probably passed all that, no?  I don't know.  I think murder always stays on your record.  It's not like a ticket.  Yeah.  Yeah, 18 months and your murder charge comes off your record.  I think he's getting sponished. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  You could take an online murder course to have the charge reduced to running through a stop sign.  She's pretty hot, by the way.  The one that took the punch.  Yeah.  She has a very punchable forehead.  Oh, wow.  She does have a big kind of forehead.  And she's banned from all NFL games.  Damn!  Yeah, her and her two other friends, they have to complete an online course.  Online.  What?  I don't know if it's the online courses.  I did one for my tickets to get my points reduced by four. 
[00:25:30]  It was retarded.  Literally retarded.  A retard could have done it.  And did.  Yes.  Step lively, Anthony.  Right into this.  Yeah.  If they want to get back into a game, they have to go to NFL obedience school.  Oh, God.  Come on.  Oh, that's funny.  Yes.  But that's what I don't understand.  There's no way.  No way!  Unless she fucked up that she gets any penalty.  She must have been awful. 
[00:26:00]  Could have been her pal, too, right?  Wasn't there a guy friend of hers there?  There was a girlfriend and a guy friend.  The guy friend might have been really fucking nasty and abusive and physical.  She might have just been verbal until she went up.  But who knows?  She looks like one of those.  She'd probably get a couple of drinks in her from fucking Boston.  Yeah.  Hot blonde chick.  She's used to yelling and screaming at whoever she wants.  Right.  And maybe she pushed this guy's mother or did something.  Fuck you, you cocksucker!  Yeah.  They got more than he got as far as...  I mean, they can't go to any NFL games. 
[00:26:30]  So they were obviously the problem, but the punch thing is a little rough.  I gotta say.  Yeah, the puncher guy has to complete a four-hour online class on how to behave.  He could have kept...  And then he has to write a handwritten letter of apology and request permission.  By the way, that's why the NFL, with this whole Redskins thing...  I know it's a different situation, but that's how they react to shit.  Yeah.  They're fucking PC babies.  You support the Redskins, right?  That's cool.  I do support the Redskins.  I mean, as a team...  No name change, right?  I don't want them to be penalized for not doing it. 
[00:27:00]  I don't want them to get in trouble.  I don't want people to boycott them.  You just think it would be the right thing to do for them to do?  And it's rare I feel that way about stuff like this, but yes, I do.  I like the onion.  Yeah.  The onion...  But exactly.  ...had a little bit of trouble there, but it's ridiculous.  They call the owner a kike.  The kike owner refuses to change...  The kike owner refuses to change Redskins' name.  They call him a hook-nosed Jew.  Oh, but the article is classic onion.  And the people that are upset about it just...  It obviously went right over their heads.  Exactly.  I love it.  That's what the onion does.  I love what the onion does. 
[00:27:30]  It's pure satire with no apologies, although they did apologize once.  And it's making a great point.  Yeah.  They apologized for calling that nine-year-old actress a cunt.  It's just hilarious.  Well, they are making the same point I made in the tweet two weeks ago.  But, you know...  Exactly.  It's still nice to see.  The guy got out of murder because his father's a police officer?  Do we know that?  Well, I don't know if you can get out of murder if your father's a cop, but perhaps that's  why he got three years.  Yeah, he pled down to a much lesser charge.  And people think it's because his dad's a sergeant. 
[00:28:00]  The point is, I think if you get banned from a stadium, you can get in.  I really do.  Yeah, I agree.  They don't have face recognition.  They don't ask for IDs.  How many times have you gone into a stadium and all they do is scan your ticket and you walk  in?  Yeah, as long as you're not stupid enough to go sit in your regular seat because they  might check for a little while.  He's not going to have those.  They can put his picture up by every ticket taker.  But they don't do that.  They're scanning 80,000 people into the game.  Yeah, but there's not many that are 6'8 and there's videos of them punching someone.  Somebody might spot him.  You wear sunglasses and a hat. 
[00:28:30]  He wouldn't do that.  I'm not saying go to the next home game.  I'm saying you give it a little time and then, you know.  But a picture is better than like...  I've never seen a picture.  You've got to think people are already banned from MetLife and I don't see pictures laying  around.  If you go into like bodegas and see people hang up people's bounce checks so you can't  actually do a transaction in that store anymore.  And that's not even a picture.  It's just a check.  But aren't those people moving around?  That's store policy.  But that's a dumb store policy too because who's dumb enough to go to the same place 
[00:29:00]  twice with the scam?  It's probably very convenient.  Nah, come on.  That good stuff there.  They're not dumb.  They move that shit around.  Yeah, but if it's in your neighborhood.  They fuck up this store owner and then they move on to somebody else across town.  What?  I said if it's in your neighborhood though.  You want to go to that store.  Right, it's right in your neighborhood.  Nah, you've got to give up on the bodega.  All your friends go there.  You've got to give up on the Jetsmobile.  You've got to give up on...  Oh, is this a thing?  Well, could be.  Little, little Yeri Seinfeld.  Now I'm answering you like it's a real thing. 
[00:29:30]  It was a clown check, wasn't it?  Yeah.  My least favorite part of this new bit is that I have to keep a straight face.  Well, did you hear what happened with the...  I'm just having a conversation with a goofball at this point.  With a fictional fucking setting.  A goofball.  With a fucking...  I'm answering them like it's a normal conversation.  Are you getting them with a poppy story the other day?  Oh, poppy.  That one killed me.  I was so mad at that one.  Well, the guy from the fucking who went to jail, this, whatever he is, for manslaughter, 
[00:30:00]  I guess.  Yeah.  There was...  Him and his friends had a masturbation contest.  And he threw a dollar in when he finally jacked his car.  How shoehorned in.  A goofball.  Beretta.  We should continue with sports.  World Series starts tonight.  Boston starts at Fenway. 
[00:30:30]  And it's, what, fourth time?  Or third time Sox are in it in, what, a decade?  Something like that.  Nine years.  That's pretty impressive after their long, dry spell.  And to the Twitter people, when there's something big that happens and you're not the...  And you don't, like, tweet it within five to ten minutes, trust us.  We know about it.  Trust us.  Holy mackerel.  That's all I want to say today.  Trust us.  We know about it. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  So no one sent this to you?  I mean, I like the people that are on it quick, because then, no, I didn't know about it.  And then I'm, like, aware of something, and then I go there and check it out for myself.  But if it's four or five hours after the big thing happened, trust me, we know.  And how many people are going to send you the same thing today?  Oh, I already got a few this morning.  We're talking about the Mayor Menino thing, obviously.  I got so many links to the Mayor Menino clip that...  What else did you get yesterday?  Anything else fun? 
[00:31:30]  Maybe a little Mike Francesa.  Got some Mike Francesa.  No, I didn't get that one.  Oh, I got that one.  I was trying to help.  Oh, no, no, I didn't get it.  No, I didn't get it.  And I'm looking like, really?  Of course you did.  Yes.  The best thing that happened on Twitter yesterday, by far, is the fact that...  And maybe it's too inside, because...  I don't know.  I mean, not everyone knows Lady Di, but Lady Di has joined Twitter.  Oh!  It is the greatest thing.  What a magic moment that was. 
[00:32:00]  It is the greatest thing ever.  Did you read, like, her first tweets, where she was just saying hi to you, to nobody?  She doesn't know that you have to put the at and then the name.  So she thought just by going, just, hi, Opie, that Opie would see it.  It's the greatest thing ever.  She's going to drive everyone insane.  I encourage you to follow her, so she'll drive you insane.  Because she can't help herself.  She has a shitty Twitter name.  It's terrible.  It's a terrible name.  Like, most people try to come up with some little, like, little twist on their name. 
[00:32:30]  It's, uh, yeah, a nickname or something.  What's her?  What's hers?  It's Diana or Banny 777.  Colin is all over this.  Oh, I know.  He's asking her for a follow back.  Colin, because she was like, hi, Colin.  Again, just writing his name.  Hi, Colin.  Read all 28 tweets.  All right.  Oh, my God, she's got 28 now.  Yeah.  The first one tweeted out to the entire Twitter world.  To everyone on Twitter.  No at mention.  None. 
[00:33:00]  No hashtag either.  No hashtag, no at mention.  Is this Opie from the radio show?  She thought.  So she thinks Twitter is me, I guess.  She thought you'd get it.  Right.  Put it out.  But I did get it for some reason.  I know.  Because then you get the people, and I thank them, because they're early in on this shit.  They sent that to me.  It's classic.  Did you check this out yet?  Then she tweets out, with no at mention, no hashtags.  Hi, Opie.  It's Lady Di.  Now, you should have seen this. 
[00:33:30]  Now there's two of them.  Well, you know.  The third one, no hashtag, no at mention.  Hi, Colin.  It's me, Lady Di.  I finally found one of you guys.  What?  What does she mean by found one of you guys?  It's not.  And then she just tweets a picture with no.  Oh, my God.  It's just a link to a Twitter picture, and it's the worst picture I've ever seen of her.  Baby's comment.  What did you write about her picture?  I said, it looks like William Churchill's passport photo. 
[00:34:00]  But you hit her with a better one.  Fucking Anthony hit her with, you look like you washed your face with hornets.  She's all puffy.  It's all bloated and swollen.  Winston Churchill.  What did I put?  William.  Did I put William?  You said William.  Oh, I hope I fucking throw Winston.  That's Winston's brother.  It's close enough.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Yeah, Bill Churchill.  He's a good guy.  And the easy one, she officially looks like Throw Mama from the Train.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's unbelievable. 
[00:34:30]  It's uncanny at this point.  Someone posted a picture of the Throw Mama from the Train lady.  It looked better than Lady Di's picture.  Really?  And I'm not kidding.  Wow.  Yes.  What else?  The next tweet is just a retweet, I guess, of your response.  But there's no at mention on it.  It just says, yes, exclamation, exclamation, exclamation.  I was so excited.  Oh, my God.  But she's such a dope.  I quoted her, and then I wrote, me, yes.  Yeah.  People still have a problem with her, right?  Me, but whatever.  She just retweeted, just says yes.  Well, that was my excitement, knowing that she was on Twitter, because I know this is 
[00:35:00]  going to be great fodder.  And then she just retweeted, Opie Radio, as an at mention, with no text behind it.  Right.  Then she, as an at mention to Opie Radio, wrote, hi, Opie and Anthony and Jim.  Uh-huh.  Then she wrote, as an at mention to Opie Radio, this is Lady Di and Marion.  And Marion.  But Marion doesn't want anything to do with her Twitter account, I bet.  And then, as an at mention to Opie Radio, just trying to figure this Twitter out.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's got to get smoke pouring out of her dumb ears. 
[00:35:30]  She can't figure it out.  No, she can't.  It's Twitter.  Talking to one of the fans about figuring out Twitter.  My favorite part, the meeting, the great meeting between two mental icons.  Bobo and Lady Di had an exchange on Twitter.  Oh, really?  She didn't tweet out to the world, no at mention.  She just wrote, no tall boys tonight.  Oh, beers. 
[00:36:00]  I guess she's drinking, yeah.  Yeah, okay, sure.  She meant basketball players.  A lot of tweets to Colin, a lot of tweets to Opie.  Yep.  And then the Bobo conversation begins.  Bobo gives her a little Twitter advice.  Really?  What does he say?  Yes.  He wrote, hey, newbie, N-E-W-B-E, welcome to Twitter, T-W-I-T-E-R.  Uh-huh.  Twitter.  It's Bobo, still not too late to get out, T-O instead of T-O-O. 
[00:36:30]  Twitter can, the letter B, brutal.  Twitter can be brutal.  That's right.  He knows.  So what's she write?  Uh, she looks like.  At first she wrote nothing.  Yeah, she didn't, well, no, she did not respond to that one.  Unless this is.  No, that's the response right there.  Oh, she, she responded by just at mentioning him.  And then she wrote, hi, how are you?  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Hi, how are you?  It's like, Anthony, how are you tonight?  The, hi, how are you?  The, uh, Mike Buschetti special.  Oh, jeez, Mike.  Mike.  Thank you for, thanks for the follow back.  It was my pleasure.  My pleasure.  How are you?  And how are you?  How are you?  Mike, we love you.  Oh, my God.  Put his two fingers up.  Oh, yeah.  Can we get him back immediately?  He's classic.  Well, he Facebook messaged me again this morning.  All right.  Figure out when it makes sense. 
[00:37:30]  Sure, next week.  Just book him.  And then she started tweeting to Anthony.  Yeah, which I didn't answer.  Hi, Anthony.  How are you tonight?  And then she tweeted again to Anthony.  Marion and I are going to the Dyson Jim Norton show in November.  Oh, well.  Yes.  Oh, that means she's not going to be able to come to your party.  That is the night of my party.  When?  Oh, November 1st.  Oh, no.  I'll go after.  It's the same.  Yeah, exactly.  Can you bring Diane Marion?  Of course.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Got room in your car for them? 
[00:38:00]  That'd be good.  That's cool.  Imagine that car, right?  You really should drive them out there.  I have a horse trailer.  Yeah.  She's getting a lot of fucking.  She doesn't need enough room for the ass.  She's getting a lot of follows.  Oh, yeah.  She deserves them.  She is.  Yeah.  She's up to like 500.  She's almost 600.  Oh, fuck.  Wow.  We just gave her 200.  It was like 400 when we started talking about her.  Follow her.  She'll drive you insane.  Oh, yeah.  Like she does us.  Again, if you can figure out how to spell it, it's Diana or Banny 777. 
[00:38:30]  Right.  They're figuring it out, I guess.  Calling after what the sevens were.  Oh, yeah.  He goes, what's that?  You're 21?  Your age?  Me too.  He's just.  Yeah.  His awful tweets.  Yeah.  I love what he really gets excited about.  He loves Lady Di and Marion.  Out of everything that goes on around this.  Did you see who's calling his show Unconstitutional The Touche?  The Touche.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, yeah, doing my show The Touche.  Dude, that's so douchey.  It's fucking, it's enraging.  I love him. 
[00:39:00]  Do you know what it is?  That's holpster territory.  Oh, The Touche.  His tweet to Lady Di was actually, I'm, because she wrote, you know, she's talking about Twitter.  And he wrote to her, I'm in.  Please follow me back if you have mine to.  Thanks, doll.  Oh, she's going to be all, oh, Colin's nice.  I'm not getting any sarcasm whatsoever.  So anyway, that happened on Twitter and also everyone sending us the Mayor Menino clip,  which is just another classic. 
[00:39:30]  The good Mayor Menino.  Was there anything else with the press conference or just this is the highlight?  That was it.  He's got a good, he's got a good Mayor Menino Boston accent thing going on in that clip, too.  Here it is.  The never die Red Sox for playing the third World Series.  The last nine years.  Yes.  Waddley hooten hard to bring back.  Waddley hooten hard.  Waddley hooten hard. 
[00:40:00]  Waddley hooten hard.  We're going to miss him.  Waddley hooten hard.  He doesn't have much time left.  Nope.  I mean on this planet.  Oh, man.  It's not looking good.  Going to be rooting hard, I believe.  Going to be rooting hard.  Waddley hooten hard.  Nine years.  Waddley hooten hard to bring back.  Waddley hooten hard.  Waddley hooten hard.  I think it's Waddley hooten hard.  It's Waddley hooten hard.  Yeah.  Oh, that doesn't know.  Waddley hooten hard.  I'm so glad we're bringing that back.  The last nine years. 
[00:40:30]  It is.  Waddley hooten hard to bring back.  The World Series Cup to Boston like we did in 2004 and 2007.  World Series Cup.  Yeah, the World Series Cup.  That's it.  Makes that clip.  He's going to take Big Papi's Cup and just put it over his nose and wear it like a Japanese  guy who's scared of SARS.  Well, like a fucking horse in a feed bag.  He's going to eat potato salad out of it.  Big Papi's athletic supporter.  Waddley hooten hard.  Waddley hooten hard. 
[00:41:00]  He might as well have said, huddley hooten hard.  I'm quite sure he did.  Yes.  Oh, what a tool.  A giant fucking tongue.  Very good.  And then we got Mike Francesa.  Yes.  Another guy we're loving lately.  Mike, every day now, I'm seeing clips of Mike Francesa online taking a call that he's  a little angry about, a prank call, wondering why the people would spend so much time on 
[00:41:30]  hold to say something so incredibly stupid.  I think it's been a thing, obviously, for a while, but I think the Mike Francesa thing  is really starting to ramp up.  Yeah, it's taking off.  It's starting to ramp up.  People are apparently aware now that he's on television.  He will take calls, and he gets a little miffed.  And other places enjoy it just as much as they do.  So that just makes more people want to get in on it.  And he's such a curmudgeon that he's pushing it himself. 
[00:42:00]  Now, I like this whole thing that he's doing with Twitter, and I guess it was in the paper.  I like this.  I agree with him because there are so many tools on Twitter.  Well, Mike Francesa is not on Twitter, but there is an account that says, does it say  fake, or is it just saying?  It says it's a parody account.  Yeah, it's a parody account.  But the Daily News, I guess, you know, because the guy does a very good job with that Twitter  account, that the Daily News actually puts the tweets in the paper.  I mean, how do they quote him the name, like the full name? 
[00:42:30]  It's Mike Francesa.  It's not even his real name.  Did it say a parody account?  No, but he spelled it Mike Francesa because that's how Mike Francesa would say it.  That's right.  But here's the problem.  The actual account that you see when you're tweeting just says Mike Francesa NY.  That's the problem.  So most people wouldn't know it's a parody account if you've just seen it on your timeline.  And then the Daily News puts it in the paper, and they know it's a parody account, but they  just write at Mike Francesa NY is where this tweet came from. 
[00:43:00]  So you just assume, oh, Mike Francesa said this.  Everything is spelled in Mike Francesa speak.  Yeah, I think, once again, Mike completely missed the point here.  The Daily News loves to rag on him as much as me.  Oh, yeah, of course.  And I don't think they've ever tried to...  They don't think this is him.  No, they just...  No, I understand that.  But they're pushing it forward like they know some people are going to believe that it might  be him is what I'm trying to say here.  They've never once said, look, this is a fake account. 
[00:43:30]  No, I think they have.  You sure?  Yeah.  Find that for me, please.  Because I actually see these tweets in the paper all the time.  And, you know, they kind of put them out there as like, yeah, he could have said this.  Like this.  Because they don't like him.  I think they're just fucking with him.  Yeah, they don't like the guy.  Like everybody else is.  Very subtle, like everyone else.  I mean, if you do a little research on your own, sure, you would absolutely know it's a  parody account.  But they're pushing it like, yeah, it's a parody account, but we're not really going  to tell you that.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  The Daily News is quoting the fake Twitter account in the story about Mike Francesa being  mad about the fake Twitter account.  They got an exclusive interview.  Exclusive.  So Mike Francesa, who's not on Twitter, he went off yesterday with a little rant about  this fake Twitter account.  Yeah.  So, you know, the Daily News, which is at times been at odds for me because especially during  this, I've been attacking that A-Rod coverage, which has been incredibly one-sided, but if  the Daily News is going to start taking quotes of different personalities and then using fake 
[00:44:30]  Twitter quotes with my name on it, first of all, folks, I told you before, I don't have  a Twitter account, but they allow fake ones.  But there's one that has my name on it, which the Daily News purports like they put them next  to real quotes and act like it's a real quote for me.  So if it's one that it...  That's what I'm trying to say.  That's exactly right, what he does right there.  Oh, yeah.  They're fucking there.  So you're exactly right.  But the paper knows what they're doing.  So the problem is in the Twitter account, which is mentioned to be a parody, the problem 
[00:45:00]  is the newspaper doing it in a kind of a sneaky, we can get away with it way where  we make it look real.  Exactly.  So the problem is the paper, not the fake Twitter account.  Exactly.  Because they know what they're doing.  And even if they said once that it's a fake Twitter account, that's probably all they felt  like they needed to do, and then they'd do it another, you know, couple dozen times,  whatever, but without saying it's a fake Twitter account.  Yeah.  So.  Real quotes and act like it's a real quote for me.  So if it's one that is either offensive or makes me look bad and stuff like that, they 
[00:45:30]  don't care.  They say, hey, that's your quote.  So what I'm going to do the next time there's one I don't like.  I'm going to tell you the names and the professions of the guys who run that Twitter account.  Oh boy.  So I've won them once.  Okay.  Next time there's one I don't like.  I know.  So he's got some info on those guys where he feels like he could hurt their careers or  something.  Because why else?  I mean, if it's, I mean, if it's a plumber or a construction worker or whatever, who 
[00:46:00]  cares?  But it seems like the guys that are running that account really don't want their names  out there for any reason.  Or he's bluffing.  Yeah.  Or maybe he thinks that they don't want their names out, but they could care less.  Right.  Or, you know, he might see it as them fucking with his business.  So he's just going to give out their business.  So maybe.  And then everyone's going to be like, oh, you're awesome.  Yeah.  I think a lot of people are going to say you're awesome.  Let me buy your stuff.  And so many more people are now following this fake fucking Mike Francesa account.  What are you doing, Mike?  Next time there's one I don't like. 
[00:46:30]  I know the guys' names.  I know what they do.  So I will tell you about the guys.  Okay.  Who do it.  Now, they do it, they say, as fans.  But you know what?  They also do it sometimes to make me look bad.  Oh, really?  Sometimes?  Next time I will tell you who they are and what they do.  Which, for some reason, they don't want anyone to know.  But they're just regular guys, working guys.  But they feel that it would hurt their professions.  Well, next time they annoy me, I will tell you their names and where they work.  I promise you.  All right. 
[00:47:00]  I can't wait.  Yeah, so if they're regular guys, they don't give a fuck.  They'll be fine.  You see fucking some princess that mentioned my name and company.  Yeah, I don't think they're being like over-the-top crazy racist or whatever.  Some of those things might get you in trouble with your boss.  How did he get their names, though?  I mean, he may know someone there, but...  I don't know.  I'm sure...  I don't know.  I don't know if I believe him.  I'm sure someone ratted the fake account out.  Sometimes there's a post that leads you to the next clue, a Facebook thing. 
[00:47:30]  You know, it's kind of amazing how you can track who's doing what.  Because they just use a fake...  Because no one's going to attack their real name.  Oh, you know how you can on the phone if you have multiple accounts under one app?  Like, I mistakenly tweet.  I have allegedly Chip and Edgar are not real people.  Right.  And I have three under one, and I tweeted something as Chip, but I realized I did it under my Jim Norton account.  Oh, no.  And now that I have a Chip account, I was humiliated. 
[00:48:00]  I was humiliated that I did that.  You asshole.  Yeah, I was like, sis, sis, sis.  I was like, whoa.  That's hilarious.  People that don't know that there even is a Chip, and they'll be like, what is Jimmy doing?  It's not funny.  It's terrible.  You saw this guy once on TV?  It was okay, but this is awful.  Oh, that joke's terrible.  Did you get all hot?  The next day was a video.  It was a fucking Vine video.  It was a Chip with the penis hat.  You don't want that under your Jim Norton account? 
[00:48:30]  Did you see the hat?  It's fucking terrible.  Why, people would just appreciate that you're doing a character?  Dude, it looks...  It's so fucking embarrassing.  I say you own it.  We got Mike Francesa.  Oh, good.  Mike, thank God.  So let's get to the bottom of this.  Hey, Mike.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  A hardly hootin' horror, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning to you, sir.  Before you get into the latest controversy, which is going after the fake Twitter account  yesterday on your show, we have to also talk to you about your Diet Coke.  The Diet Coke incident, I don't know what you're talking about, okay? 
[00:49:00]  Nowadays, it's CGI, okay?  They can make anything happen.  CGI.  You think that's somebody's free to do that?  It looked pretty real when we were watching it on TV.  Oh, but listen, they can recreate dinosaurs, okay?  I want to recreate dinosaurs.  Good point.  They want to make a Coke spill on a desk, okay?  They want to make a Coke spill on a desk.  They're going to make a Coke spill on a desk.  Why can't you fess up to the fact that it actually happened?  Can we move on?  Is this what you want to talk about?  Give me some of the sports, okay? 
[00:49:30]  All right.  I got another one.  All right.  I got another one for you, Mike.  Go ahead.  How much ice cream do you eat?  We saw you trying to cover up your ice cream because you realized it was on camera.  Throw up the blockade with a piece of paper.  With a piece of paper.  You were trying to cover up your little treat.  Do you have a little ice cream treat every afternoon?  I will confess to my ice cream addiction.  I usually have a little midget nigga.  His name is Gunga Dean.  Jesus Christ.  I never remember saying that. 
[00:50:00]  I actually have his approach shaved in an ice cream bowl.  And he comes in there and breaks it.  I think his scoop he walks out of.  Wow.  Oh, all right.  Because we thought there might have been a little table underneath the console or a  little refrigerator for your ice cream.  And people also need to know what kind of ice cream does Mike Francesa like?  What kind of flavor does Mike Francesa not like?  You'll love them all, huh?  I love them all.  Okay.  31 flavors.  I stand at the counter and ask with 32 and 33.  He is an ice cream lover. 
[00:50:30]  And now yesterday you're going after the fake Twitter account.  Yeah, the fake Twitter account, it's cute.  Listen, listen.  Okay.  I've been on your show for about two years now.  Okay.  And aside from my Super Bowl bomb, okay, that I took some time off, okay, that I still haven't  fully recovered over.  I was the originator of the Mike Francesa parodies, okay, I don't want to hear it, okay, on national  radio, okay, I'm the biggest act, okay, and the fact that I have spawned all these children 
[00:51:00]  is flattering, okay, it's flattering, okay, it's funny.  But what they don't understand, okay, that I've been in the biggest city in New York, okay,  25 years, okay, I've been here longer than Jesus, been here longer than Willisbury, been  here longer than Ewing, been here longer than anybody else in the car.  Okay, I've been here for a while, okay, the connection that you make, okay, is a very  powerful position, okay, Super Bowl champion, but I've met Mayors, governors, okay, governor  of politics, big politicians, okay, Osama bin Laden, okay, Saddam Hussein, Ted Kaczynski, 
[00:51:30]  who do you think brought all these people out?  What, the FBI?  The FBI, okay, fine, that's why you read the papers, the FBI, okay, because if you read  the papers, they're also giving you a closer walk, okay, so the next time I see one of  these closer walk, I'm calling my people, okay?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy, that's more threats.  That's a threat from you, Mikey.  Don't step on me, we're all the other, okay? 
[00:52:00]  By the way, you did a great job with that 1776 Mike Francesa thing, aren't we?  Uh-oh.  Listen, yeah, the young man did a good job there, okay?  But I did, unfortunately, the impression sounds not like me.  I don't know, to be honest, look, it sounds like me, it sounds like me, okay, that's your opinion.  Oh, so that wasn't you.  I did something, it was great, okay, but it was a good job with me.  I've never seen it, okay, I've heard about it, I've never seen it, okay, I'm on a computer,  okay, which in front of me on TV is a problem. 
[00:52:30]  He's talking down to you, doesn't he?  Yeah, I love it.  All right, Mike, anything else?  You good or what?  There's only one, yes, there is only one real Twitter account, it is atracistofrancester,  or atracistofrancester.  Atracistfrancester.  Daily News should quote that one a little more.  Right?  Yeah, no kidding.  Oh, boy.  That's right.  You got a World Series prediction?  Boston.  I got to go Boston, okay, even though we may not have a cup, okay? 
[00:53:00]  We'll bring a World Series cup, I mean, gee whiz, get a clue, okay?  Gee whiz.  Okay, well, I mean, between the Celtics and the Bruins and the classical World Series wins  by the Red Sox over the last decade, okay, I think you know about it, you got to know  the trophies, okay, but if you're going to say a World Series cup, that's your prerogative,  okay?  You can play a World Series cup.  All these little fucking words.  Amazing.  That's great.  Thank you, Mike Princess.  Hey, Mike, what are you having, Diet Coke or something? 
[00:53:30]  That's a good one, Chip.  He hung up on you.  Oh, boy.  For real.  Oh, he's gone.  For real.  At Racist Francesa, if you want to follow that guy, he's amazing.  I would love to be in the room when Mike Francesa finds out what clip from that day's show is  becoming an internet thing.  Right, a sensation.  He can't be happy that everybody's playing that clip about him being mad at Twitter.  And that every second he's on camera is just a potential YouTube clip.  But he's...  Like, he doesn't know when it's going to be, what he's going to do.  He's not even aware.  He doesn't go to YouTube. 
[00:54:00]  He doesn't go to YouTube.  He's not aware.  He doesn't give a fuck, for the most part.  Well, he gave a fuck when he went to cover his goddamn ice cream.  He gave a fuck when he spilt his Diet Coke.  Oh, boy.  Was that a great foaming Diet Coke spill?  He thought he saved it.  And then it just erupts like a volcano.  One of those Mexican ones that Bartlett brought.  Yes.  The fucking foam.  Highly carbonated.  Foam.  Love it.  All right.  We break here, right?  Mm-hmm.  We got lots to do today.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:54:30]  Okay.  Maybe Jocktober today?  Yeah.  We didn't have it yesterday.  We need a little Jocktober.  A little Jocktober.  We skipped it.  Oh.  That was pretty smart, I think.  Yeah.  Maybe we should talk about the Apple announcement.  Is it a good one for you boys?  I don't know if it matters.  No.  Stock is, serious stock is fucking, whatever they're doing down the hall.  Oh, my God.  Applause, applause.  I know what they're doing.  Fucking.  Yeah, what do you think all this shit's out there?  Hey, understandable.  But as a stockholder, I want to say, I and the rest of the board are happy. 
[00:55:00]  You're happy.  Let me tell you what's going on.  Fuck yeah.  Let me make this official.  New chairs, new rug, stock going up.  This place is being fucking sold.  Damn.  You think so?  And I think people already know that, and that's why the stock is squeezing.  That's just my opinion on the whole thing.  I have no idea.  I haven't heard anything.  That's in your humble opinion, as they say.  Because it's weird when you start, like, getting new carpets and new chairs.  You're gussying it up.  You're putting a fucking paint job on.  You're waxing up the old car. 
[00:55:30]  That's when you sell your car.  Right.  You fucking get that turtle wax out for the first time.  Right.  Make it look a little nicer than it, you know.  Shine it up real nice.  Right.  Yeah.  Something's going on.  And what's all that equipment now?  That looks like they're cleaning up.  Like, that looks like shit that's been in a closet somewhere.  Storage.  Why would you do that?  It's old junk.  Why would you do that?  You got to throw it out, so when you open that closet door, you go, look at the, here's  some closet space.  Here's the glove compartment.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look how nice it is in here.  Look. 
[00:56:00]  Beautiful.  Look at all the trunk space.  All that's in here now is a spare tire, a jack, and some jumper cables.  There's been stuff rotating in that hallway for a month.  Yeah.  Boards, equipment, all that shit.  Roland.  They're cleaning up some, you know, and the company obviously is doing very well, so.  You know how the fucking new rugs smell this place is going to have?  I love a new carpet.  I used to get down and smell carpet like a dog.  New carpet smell fucking rules.  And he'd drag his ass on it.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Because, like, you know, subscribers don't get to see the new carpets.  That's true.  No.  And they've made it pretty clear they don't really care about most of the employees here,  so why would you give them nice new carpets?  Because they will understand by the pep in our step that we have the new carpet walk.  That's true.  Every morning when we sign on, happy.  Oh, this is nice.  There's people around here that haven't had raises in years, but you're going to give them  a brand new carpet?  Last week they came in out of nowhere and just took all our phones and put in brand new 
[00:57:00]  phones and the computers, too.  They switched all the computers out and everyone's got new computers.  I think it is.  Maybe that's just, someone said it's just one of those planned maintenance things that  they do every X amount of years.  Oh, sure it is.  Maybe they're trying to turn this place into a media destination.  Look, I've been doing radio since I was 18.  I've never seen a new carpet.  Oh, once.  Any W, sorry.  But that's because we destroyed the other one with cum stains and urine stains.  We christened that new carpet with a couple fucking on it. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, and Pete was not happy.  Pete Jensen.  But that was the only carpet I ever saw and it was a little carpet for one studio because  we really did ruin the other one with like the 55-gallon drum challenge and everything  else.  They had no choice.  They had to replace it because the smell was so bad.  Yeah.  That's why.  I remember them saying they found like dead cockroaches and chum in the fake floorboards.  Oh, the chum was the worst because that went between all the cracks and just starts stinking.  Yeah.  On the girls, too. 
[00:58:00]  Kind of like a pesky clam that you find in your teeth a week later.  In between your teeth.  God.  That's what happened with the NAW studio.  All that shit was fucking rotting in these little crevices.  But besides that, I've never seen new carpet at a radio station.  They're cleaning up.  Wax it up.  Wax it up.  Very, very suspicious.  Wax it up, put the sign on it, and put it out by the curb.  See what they're doing in the lobby?  What?  They're moving the staircase, right?  I think they scrapped that. 
[00:58:30]  Did they scrap that?  Why?  I think it might be too expensive.  Oh, yeah.  They want to like turn the staircase around.  So more people could watch the events in the room.  Yeah, the staircase is a little intrusive.  Supposedly it was going to be like hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Get a ladder.  Put a fucking ladder there.  Rope ladder.  That'd be fun.  Yeah, exactly.  Stand under it.  Girls in skirts.  Yeah, look at their assholes.  They've outlined the area in tape.  I guess they're putting bleachers and other stuff into the lobby.  They're basically doing what we did at XM. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  It's probably our bleachers.  Oh, man.  We had that.  Remember that?  Whatever.  They don't want to hear it again today.  I want some of that shit.  Everyone's feeling a little peaked about now about them. 
[00:59:30]  I'm just paranoid.  I'm not feeling it yet.  But if you're starting with that gulping shit.  Yeah.  Last night, I started like doing that where you feel like you have something in your throat  that you got to swallow, like a little mucus or something, and you can't swallow it.  And you know that's like, and then my voice has been a little gravelly today.  And Jimmy's feeling it a little.  And I know fucking typhoid Travis is coming in after poor little O'Reilly and his wife 
[01:00:00]  is now sick.  So he's probably a carrier of the whole thing.  So I think we're all getting sick.  So, oh, yeah.  The old, last night when I started gulping, I'm like, oh, my God, I got to get some of  that fucking shit in me.  So here it is.  Let's get some of that shit for everybody.  A little Coley's party.  They used to have Coldy's gum.  I loved Coldy's gum.  I like Chewley's.  Because it went right into your throat, and I loved it.  Isn't the jury still out on Coldy's?  Coldy, I think it is. 
[01:00:30]  Absolutely not.  I don't care what the jury says.  I feel better when I take it.  I just want to say, is the jury still out?  I hate that.  Hey, if I don't get sick, then the jury's not out.  You believe in it.  You believe in the Coldy's.  I've been saying it for years.  And what it does is it doesn't totally make you not get a cold, but it knocks it down,  according to Florentine, who turned me on to it years ago, by about 30%.  About 30% less.  30%.  What's the problem?  How do you come up with that number?  I don't know.  It increases your odds of not getting sick.  Yeah.  That's what it does.  All right. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  But yeah, it does knock it down.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Applebee.  That says a way about him.  Yeah.  His podcast, by the way, is bashing the, I guess he says something about new names.  It's about the Redskins.  Oh, okay.  The name change.  So I've not heard it, but I imagine it's very funny.  I hear it's very funny.  What about our podcast?  I heard the Louis C.K. one did very, very well. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, people.  Oh, yeah.  And you can still get that, of course, if you subscribe to the Opie and Anthony podcast.  And then I think this week we're putting the whole E-Rock saga to bed, putting that  up on the podcast.  Yep.  It's on there, too.  Oh, E.  It's a long version this week.  E-Rock.  Aaron, once in a while, we give you a long version.  This week's a long version, the whole E-Rock saga, where I accidentally fucking put his  number out on the air, and then, oh boy, did the fun ensue after that.  Will the number be left in during the podcast?  I'm hoping.  It's only right, I think. 
[01:02:00]  I don't think anyone has it yet, right?  I think the nugget is going to be his new phone number.  Oh, wow.  Would that be good?  All right.  So make sure you listen all the way to the end.  Would that be good?  Fuck yeah.  I feel a little insulted.  Do you have E-Rock's new number?  Well, I was about to say that.  What happened was, I mean, only days after I gave out his old number on the air, I get  this text from this number.  Oh.  And you know how he's vague to begin with.  Very vague.  So he's vague, and then, of course, I don't have his new number yet, so, of course, I'm 
[01:02:30]  going to go, who the fuck is this?  True.  He writes, hey, it's me.  Yeah.  I'm like, me who?  And then he finally told him, just let me pump it up a little bit.  That was a little pump up.  Pump it up.  We are in the entertainment business.  You've got to pump it up a little bit.  Yeah.  Eric, shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right.  Now you're challenging me, so let me see.  Now I'll go with complete honesty here.  Let me see. 
[01:03:00]  But anyway, I'm thinking to myself, how stupid is this guy that he's giving me his new number  so soon?  Right.  Let's see.  Eric Nagel.  Okay.  He wrote, before you leave, your Jack is in the studio.  So I wrote, who's this?  And he wrote, E-Rock.  So that was it.  But I got his new numbers, because you just asked.  Jimmy, do you have E-Rocks?  Did he text you?  Yeah, that bitch-ass motherfucker texted me. 
[01:03:30]  He did?  Yeah.  You?  Oh, yeah, I have it.  Yeah, I've had it for a little while.  Travis must have it.  Surely.  Sam?  Sam.  Sal?  Sale?  I would think Sal has it.  Does Sale have it?  The text I got, by the way, was, Jim, it's Eric.  I'm giving all of my friends my new number.  Okay.  But he knows you don't like him.  I don't want to bother you.  There's the, see, I should have E-Rock's number.  Why don't you?  There have been instances where I've been driving home. 
[01:04:00]  What's that?  I'm sorry, Ant.  This is the first text I got.  Because, you know, Johnny from the Jerky Boys.  Johnny!  Hey!  I had Twitter.  Love you, miss you, brother.  He Twittered me and thanked me and thanked us, actually, for, you know, for pointing out  that Todd from Scott and Todd was fucking ripping off his fucking guy.  The concept.  So, and I guess Johnny has been aware of this for a long time.  Yes.  But has never been able to really voice it, and we were able to voice it for him.  Yes.  Thus, then, why he's thanking us.  So, I responded to him on Twitter.  So, I get a text from this number. 
[01:04:30]  If you talk to John Brennan from Jerky Boys, maybe have him come in Friday during Scott  and Todd Jocktober.  So, I respond, who is this?  Right.  He writes, E-Rock.  Sorry, this is my new number.  Oh.  Okay.  So, we got it.  Now, why doesn't Anthony have your number?  There have been instances where I've had to call various guys from the show for information.  It's something, you know, or I left something here. 
[01:05:00]  It's something.  And I've texted E-Rock, and, you know, I'm having a big Halloween party.  I would have liked to have, you know, maybe text you.  Oh, you wouldn't have been invited.  He's invited.  Everybody's invited.  Thank you.  Everyone's invited.  Nice.  To my Halloween party.  Unfortunately, it's the same day as Jimmy's Dice Show, but you could go to the Dice Show  and then come by after.  Yeah.  I'll go there.  I'll be over there by 1030.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, November 1st, Friday, November 1st, E-Rock, of course. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, didn't you want to give Ant your phone, your new phone number so he can text you like  usual for his parties?  Oh, boy.  Like usual.  I get it.  Why doesn't Anthony have your number, E-Rock?  E-Rock, why?  You must have made a conscious decision not to give it to me.  Because I'm the only one you didn't give it to.  No, because...  But he's not officially giving it out, though.  No, because...  Hold on.  That's the other side of this, which is a little creepy.  He's not officially giving it to anybody.  He's waiting for a reason where he needs to get a hold of you, and then, of course, you  see the number, and you go, who is this, like I did and Jimmy did. 
[01:06:00]  Then he goes, it's E-Rock.  Instead of just saying, hey, it's E-Rock, here's my new number, he's waiting for the opportunity  where he actually has to tell you something.  Oh.  No, I'm not that smart.  Oh.  It was...  I forget I have the new number, so when I text people, and they write back...  How do you forget you have a new number?  Because I didn't send it to everybody.  But you can't forget you have a new number.  It was...  It was...  It was catastrophic.  Stop it, let me finish explaining, and then you can jump all over me for this. 
[01:06:30]  Whoa.  But this tact of yours never works, because you just show how stupid you are.  Yeah.  If you really want to get into it.  Yeah.  Because my point, and it needs to be said, is your old number, what happened to it was  so catastrophic.  How do you forget you have a new number?  That's my question.  Because when I wrote Jimmy, and when I wrote you, I hadn't given it to you yet.  So when I wrote everything out, and then you write back, who's this?  I go, fuck, I forgot to tell them my new number.  So then I go, A, it's E-Roc.  Say, thank you.  Thank you for doing exactly what I thought you would do. 
[01:07:00]  E-Roc likes a little mystery.  Right.  He does like mystery.  Who is this?  How do you forget?  I mean...  He has tears of when he's going to inform certain groups of people on his phone number.  T-I-E-R-S.  Did he just write you?  Yes.  I think he did.  What did he say?  Fuck you, Guinea.  That's how you're watching the news.  That's a good callback right there, E-Roc.  Let me see.  Contact.  Good stuff.  And I will make a new phone contact for E to the R. 
[01:07:30]  Nice.  All right.  Contact.  You finally got it.  I got it.  Create new contact.  E-Roc.  There we go.  Well, I'm glad we could put that behind us.  Done.  I'm glad we did, too. 
[01:08:00]  Here it is.  I want Troy Kwan to know, the man that shall not be mentioned, that there's a party.  He'll probably be, you know, busy, though.  DJing or something.  He'll probably be like that.  Yeah.  My Halloween costume is boss.  Is it?  Boss.  I'm trying to find one for little Beavis.  No.  You're not going to be one of those guys, are you?  Yes, you should.  Put a little ribbon in his hair.  No, you can't.  No.  Put him in a little costume. 
[01:08:30]  He'll be adorable.  No?  Same thing as my dinosaur.  Everyone laughs, and they all want to take pictures with it.  I was just making fun of those people on tour the other day.  Yeah, I know.  But, I mean, I'm not going to dress him up.  But if you do, because I think you are, just flip it.  Make it something like, okay.  Hitler.  Hitler.  Yeah, something like that.  He dressed up like his owner.  You should go into a pet store and say, do you have any little Nazi cat costumes?  Little Nazi costumes?  I'm looking for his little armbands. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  He's very small, so he needs a tight, small armband.  I hate cat people.  Do you?  I like people that have cats.  Yeah, I don't like cat people.  I hate cat people.  Yeah.  There's a cat person that works for Channel 7 News here in New York.  Oh.  Her name is Amy Freeze, and she's supposed to do the weather.  Uh-huh.  But on the weekends, I'm up early.  She's the weekend gal.  What's her name?  Amy Freeze.  And she does the weather?  Of course.  But she swears it's her real name. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  I, this is what I mean by hating cat people.  She does the weather on the weekends, and she dedicates, like, Saturdays to cats.  Catterday.  You've heard it.  No, no, no, not Catterday.  I've heard it online.  They have Catterday.  And then Sundays is Super Dog Sunday.  And all the bit is, you send in dumb pictures of your stupid cat, and you hope that she  shows it on her break.  Oh.  That's what I mean by hating cat people. 
[01:10:00]  That's going way too fucking far.  And then she showed Halloween costumes, like, this past weekend.  It drove me nuts.  I'm seeing this is her Facebook.  There's a lot of pictures.  There you go.  She's...  A lot of pictures.  I hate people that are obsessed to that point.  You could have a cat, treat it well, and be a good person, but...  I've got to be honest, my Instagram, at this point, is full of little Beavis pictures.  Aww.  Because, you know, he's at that little, still, you know, in between kitten cat phase.  He's at the awkward growing stage. 
[01:10:30]  So, you know, and I've got a nice camera and stuff, so I snap off quite a few pictures  of the little guy.  Aww.  He is getting quite beastly in his old age, though.  He's old age.  He's, um, wow.  Yeah.  He's getting very strong, and, uh, he's very wild.  When he jumps now, and jumps into you, it, it, it hurts.  Really?  And he, and he jumps with his mouth open.  So it's not even the bite.  He will lunge and put all his weight behind his lower teeth, and hit you with him like 
[01:11:00]  a saber-toothed tiger.  Are, are you starting to think that you've got a tiger instead of a, a cat?  I think there's a little more Asian leopard in him than, uh, previously anticipated.  Really?  He's a maniac.  You're, you're in deep trouble, you're a cat.  He's fucking crazy.  Look, yeah, he's standing up on the table.  You only have a couple weeks left before he's not a cute kitten anymore.  He, well.  He's growing fast, right?  He's adorable.  It's weird.  Nobody warned you that this would happen.  No, it, it's, he, but he's, he's very cute. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, no, I read a lot about the Bengal breed, and that they're, uh, kind of wild and, uh,  stuff.  I don't care, though.  He, he, he knocked over the Halloween decorations onto the floor, and, uh, just started, um, eating  one of the giant Halloween rats that I have, the mechanical rats.  Actually eating it.  Yeah, he's eating its tail.  And, um, yeah, he, he definitely goes a little crazy. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, here's that plane.  It's already starting?  Flying, uh, this was moments ago, I guess.  The FDNY jet over New York City.  Jet Blue flying FDNY jet, uh, moments ago.  Yeah, there it is.  That's, uh, that's, uh, reminiscent of, uh, Air Force One.  Sure.  And that.  Just like you said would happen.  I bet, uh.  It's the red plane in the sky that people are going to freak out about.  You, you'll see.  There will be.  There will be 9-1-1 calls that will, I'm sure will be playing by tomorrow. 
[01:12:30]  Hello.  Damn.  That's the one, right, Ann?  That's the one.  Look at that juice.  A little chocolate.  My brother-in-law has called it juice.  Juice?  They go to the black mall to check out the juice.  I probably shouldn't blow up their spot.  It's funny.  They're like, hey, you want to go check out some juice?  That's one of the things I do when I go to Philly.  Juice.  They call it juice, yes.  Yes.  So, uh, all right, well.  Yeah, well, you know.  I guess you're, are you becoming a cat? 
[01:13:00]  No, no, no.  I'm not a cat person, because my whole life doesn't revolve around cats.  No, you're a person with a cat, and you appreciate it, and you're nice to the cat.  He's a lot of fun to play with.  It's the obsessed cat people.  There's something fucking wrong with them.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Some people make their whole lives about their cat and other people's cats and the dogs and  fucking animals, and you could always tell, because wherever they go, their clothes are  just packed with hair.  Look at that nice close-up of his little tiger face. 
[01:13:30]  But, like, the dog people?  Yeah.  When you, when you see the crazy dog people, the one thing I think is, oh, they're having  sex with the dog, because they love it.  Oh, man.  They're so, because they're so into it.  So into it.  All right, if you're into something that much, you're having sex with it.  So loving with your doggy.  Yes, that's the, that's the, that's what I think.  Yeah.  You know, you could be a very good pet owner.  Don't confuse this.  You could be a very good pet owner, but it's those over-the-top obsessed people. 
[01:14:00]  I'm like, nah, man, there's something going on.  A little too much.  There's something fucked up with that person.  I think they're having sex with their pet.  A little too much.  Having sex with the dog.  A little peanut butter.  Yeah, I think they're going to Sam's Club for the big fucking peanut butter.  Mm-hmm.  Jug.  Jug of peanut butter.  Ah.  Yeah, so.  That doesn't look like just a regular cat.  There, there looks like there's something else going on in that cat.  Yeah, there's, there's something else.  Those ears, there's something going on with those ears, man.  Ears are very, um. 
[01:14:30]  Are you suspicious for real?  Jeff, and he's like, no, I, I just know he's got a lot of, uh, Jeff Leopard in him.  That Asian leopard.  How, are those evil?  Uh, well, I'm sure they're a little more.  No, if you get a pure, a pure bread.  Oh, man, it'll probably rip your fucking arm off.  So you're hoping that the, the percentage is down in this one.  Yeah, I don't, I don't know, though.  He's pretty wild.  He's good, though.  He loves water.  Just jumps in the fucking sink.  I'm brushing my teeth.  He gets under the water.  You squirt him with the water gun, you know?  It's like, like, hey, no, no. 
[01:15:00]  And you squirt him.  He backs off for a second.  Like, licks the water for two seconds.  And then jumps back at you.  Like, just fucking, doesn't care.  Perfect.  Discipline won't work, then.  No.  No discipline works.  And if I just yell, like, no.  And you, you, you know, you put your hand up and just go, no.  The ears go back.  Does this slow roll of the head thing.  And it just jumps at you.  Like, ah!  Do you see that evil in his eyes?  Yes.  Look deep in his eyes.  You'll see it.  There's this demonic.  You'll see it.  Plunging the teeth into the neck of a zebra look. 
[01:15:30]  His pupils expand so it's his entire eyeball.  Black, lifeless eyes, like a doll's eyes.  Does he listen to your commands?  Not a one.  None.  You need to train it a little bit.  I don't know what to do.  I'm at a loss with training this cat.  You might have to get one of those whisperers.  I need a cat whisperer.  Get a whisperer.  Those weirdos.  What do you need to do?  I will show you how you keep the cat from climbing your leg. 
[01:16:00]  No.  Oh, cat daddy.  Is he the guy?  Oh, yeah.  You got to get the cat daddy.  What?  You know what my mother used to do with a kitty?  What did your mutter used to do?  My mother, if the cat was acting all rambunctious, she'd go chipper, and she'd put the cat in  a milk bucket, and she'd spin it around in circles, and the cat would get dizzy.  Oh, that's mean.  No, but then the cat would be all wobbly.  We'd laugh.  Lamar would laugh.  This looks like the worst book ever written.  Roland was pitching this guy in the beginning of the summer.  Well, he's Jackson Galaxy. 
[01:16:30]  He hosts My Cat from Hell.  Good for him.  I have no idea what his name is, and I don't need to know.  Any clips of him on the internet?  I'd like to hear how he talks.  Wait, wait.  Cat Daddy, it says, how one very special cat fixed one very broken man.  Oh, no.  This sounds like...  Oh, boy.  That's his life.  Includes tips for raising happy, healthy cats.  I'm going to get this book for you for Christmas.  Yeah?  He's got a show.  Yeah.  It's like Home and Gardens or something like that.  I want to hear what he sounds like when he talks. 
[01:17:00]  I'm expecting something.  You know, I was alone, and I had nobody.  I'm just misunderstood.  Agatha Oliver.  My husband is asthmatic, so our cats, both 10 months, have to stay out of our bedroom.  One lad recently worked out how to open the door.  He's really smart.  Luckily, the door has a lock, but now he hangs off the handle, kicks the door loudly. 
[01:17:30]  She says she uses a lemon, cut into discs, hangs them from the handle, keeps them off  the door.  Keeping away a vampire.  It's amazing what we'll think of, right?  Basically, she's saying that he's loud, he's keeping them up at night, and her husband cannot  let him in the room because he'll have an asthma attack.  Is this his only show?  Like an internet-type show?  It's much the same thing.  No, it's a TV show.  Jody says, please address the issue.  It's really meowing, meowing, meowing, meowing, any other time of the day for what seems  like no reason.  Animal Planet or something?  My cat is 15 years old. 
[01:18:00]  It was yelling at me.  Also, Gail Meckley.  This is terrible.  Horrible.  Cares.  This is terrible.  Well, Gail Meckley.  Yeah.  Wants to know.  I love that cat.  Something clicks, and Bear just becomes vicious.  Oh, man.  He'll sink his teeth in your hand.  Oh, no.  This is one of the toughest cases I've ever seen.  Oh, man.  What do you do?  What do you do?  I don't want to give up on him. 
[01:18:30]  It's fun.  Well, he scares easily.  I'm bleeding already.  Come on.  His claws come out.  Welcome to your future, Anthony.  Oh, man.  This is the future.  And then we end up arguing.  Sometimes I really feel torn between Matt and the cat.  Throw the cat in the garage.  Yeah.  I say give Matt his walking paper.  Wait.  He's kind of rock and roll.  He's coming up.  He carries his cat stuff in a guitar case.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, shit. 
[01:19:00]  Cats in general are unappreciative assholes.  Period.  But I've never met one I couldn't help.  What?  In my career, I've worked with thousands of cats.  What does he do?  How does he fix them?  He's the cat daddy.  And retraining them and their guardians.  Does he have gloves on?  When relationships are at an end.  It's getting to the point where I feel resentful.  And cat guardians have reached their emotional limit.  Cat guardians?  They don't call them owners, right?  I'm their owner.  They're cat guardians.  Ew.  What?  He doesn't want to use the word owner.  No. 
[01:19:30]  Cat daddy.  He's in a pretty helpless position.  Cats have nine lives, but humans only have one.  Oh.  Really?  My cat from hell.  Oh.  Wow.  Now what?  I would watch this, though.  I would watch this just to see how he fixes this.  Because I don't think it's possible.  The cat on top of the fish is a vicious cat.  Holy shit.  Can you pause right there for one second?  Is that a bear?  I do not want to lose this phone call. 
[01:20:00]  Oh.  I do not want to lose this phone call.  We'll go back to the cat thing in two seconds.  Jody in Canada.  Go ahead, Jody.  How's it going, boys?  Hi, girl name.  Why are there so many girl names in Canada?  I don't know.  Most of the girls...  I phone him the same guy.  Oh, you're just the same guy with the girl name.  Oh, okay.  Girl name.  Well, I rented a fucking basement suite from this guy in Brandon, and fucking, we're partying  downstairs, me and my buddies.  And I go upstairs to check on the guy, and fucking, he's laying fucking semi-passed out 
[01:20:30]  in the middle of the floor, and he has one of those fucking, what are the cop dogs?  He's a fucking canine fucking, not Doverman Tinchers, but one of those big fuckers, and  he's stuck as a dog with his leg, and he's fucking jerking the thing off.  He was jerking off his dog?  He was jerking off the fucking dog.  It was fucking disgusting.  We always figured there was something going on with the guy, like he had fucking peanut  butter laid out and everything. 
[01:21:00]  Come on.  All right, listen, brother.  Brother, you want to be on the radio, I guess.  There's a couple problems with your story, though.  Like, why would you check on your landlord, ever?  Well, he used to fucking come down and party with us.  But you said, oh, I got to go check on the landlord, and you go upstairs, and he's half  passed out, jerking off a dog?  His kidney was gone.  He was in a bathtub with a note to get to the hospital.  I swear to fuck on my kids that that's happened.  I could say that, because I don't have kids, so it makes me seem like I'm really sincere. 
[01:21:30]  Not that you know all that.  I swear to my kids.  You and Pauly D.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, boy.  I got six of them.  What?  I got six of them.  I don't know, man.  I'm trying to figure this out if it's true.  No, I fucking shit hit off, boys.  I fucking, you know what?  You guys are my favorite.  So you go upstairs, and the guy's just jerking off a dog?  He's semi-passed out on the floor, and the dog's lying between his legs.  How would he continue jerking off a dog if he's semi-passed out? 
[01:22:00]  He was fucking right out.  I shit you not.  And how was his technique?  Was it good?  And was the dog hung?  What are those fucking dogs called?  The fucking dog, the cock dogs.  Doesn't matter.  What, a German Shepherd?  A German fucking Shepherd.  Of course, all right.  How hung could a fucking German Shepherd be?  It's the old Red Rocket bit.  What do you guys think?  I don't believe it.  It stinks.  This is terrible.  Awful.  It's the truth, boys.  Awful.  Jody, no one's believing you, brother.  You guys have to believe me. 
[01:22:30]  We don't have to do shit.  How about that?  Hey, I love you guys.  I listen to you guys very much.  All right.  Well, we don't love you as much after this phone call, because we think you're just trying  to get on the air.  No, no, no.  That's not bullshit.  I can fucking...  Hush now.  Hush now.  Yeah, take it easy, Jody.  Hush now.  All right, Jody.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  Be good.  There was potential there, but we're not buying it, right?  I think he was lying.  I think he was lying, too.  No one checks on their landlord.  No, his story didn't wash. 
[01:23:00]  It sounds like an urban legend.  And how fucking passed out do you have to be if you're the landlord jerking off your dog  that you don't hear the fucking tenant coming upstairs to check on you?  And the dog just keeps laying there?  Right.  I don't get it at all.  It doesn't make sense.  The dog would begin woofing.  Yes.  Unless he tiptoed in to check on his landlord, but why would you do that?  You wouldn't be sneaky about it.  I think the guy was faking it.  The girl name was fucking bullshit.  Very good news, though.  We got a real one coming in now.  Bob the Trucker.  Bob.  Good morning. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  We don't need all that.  Happy birthday.  We heard you.  Sometimes we don't need that.  Sometimes we just need you to go right for it.  All right.  I jack my dog off all the time.  He likes it, and I think it's funny.  What about this one?  This has potential.  I think that fucking whatever that device is there should be unplugged.  The phone.  You don't believe that?  This guy jerks off his dog?  No, I wouldn't care if he did.  Bob, no one believes that you jerk over.  I don't care if you do. 
[01:24:00]  I do it right in front of my friends as a joke.  So, uh, fuck it now, boys.  All right.  A joke.  Well, how about a story about an Iraqi fucking a goat?  Do you want that one?  I don't believe, but no.  I believe it.  Only if it's the goat on the phone.  Yeah, we do have a...  Let's fuck to the goat.  Mike in Virginia.  Mike.  What's going on, guys?  All right.  We know we're great.  Let's get to the stories.  Jesus.  So, about five years ago, when I was deployed, we were out on a mission, and we walked up 
[01:24:30]  on an Iraqi guy fucking a goat.  I shit you not.  I believe this one.  This one, I believe.  I shit you not.  Now...  He shits us not.  ...forward about two months later, the same group of Iraqis ended up getting hurt.  They ended up in our cache.  The one Iraqi went to some of my guys and said, please save my goat.  I love him very much.  All right.  Guy loves his goat.  Whatever. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, but...  It's another country.  They do wacky things.  What do you want from us?  Yeah, people, you know, have sex with animals all the time.  Wow.  I'm checking out, guys.  Yeah.  All right.  Your best.  Want to talk to Lisa?  Well, it's a girl.  Okay, let's try this.  Lisa in Rhode Island.  Lisa, go Sox, by the way.  Hi, it's Lisa from Rhode Island.  I'm a Yankees fan.  Yankees fan of Rhode Island.  I guess that's possible, kind of, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  It's sort of on the border-ish.  Yeah, it's right there.  It's almost Connecticut, you know.  All right.  Anyways, Anthony, my cat recently attacked me.  Oh, yeah?  This is your future.  It's going to happen.  He's an indoor cat.  He's fine inside.  He escaped.  He got outside.  And it was, I was trying to catch him.  And I went to go catch him.  And he just, like, bit the shit out of me.  Oh.  Well, he was probably very scared being outside.  He was.  I don't even know if he was scared. 
[01:26:00]  I think he was just angry that I was going to try to get him.  He was missing.  He was.  So I had to go on, like, two rounds of antibiotics.  I had my hands all covered up.  They were swollen.  What's the matter with you?  No immune system?  Jesus Christ.  Sounds like you need the cat down.  Yeah, what are you, a fucking hemophiliac?  Yeah, geez.  So what did you do with the cat?  Nothing.  As soon as I brought him inside, he was fine.  He smelled all those wacky fucking smells and animals outside.  Those freaked him out.  Feral cats out there.  Really? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  He started fucking freaking out.  All right.  Thank you, Lisa.  You're welcome.  The phones are doing well now.  We got Jill.  She jerks off dogs.  Jill.  Jill, do you jerk off dogs?  I do not personally jerk off dogs, but I work with a breeding company, a breeding panel  that breeds dogs for seeing eye dogs, and they jerk off the dogs to get the sperm for artificial  insemination.  Have you seen this?  I have seen it, yeah. 
[01:27:00]  And how does it go down?  They stand the dog up on a doctor table, and they jerk the dog off, and they collect the  sperm, and then they artificially disseminate the female.  There's no machine for that?  Yeah.  It's how they make mouthwash.  It's disgusting.  Didn't they used to come up with, I don't know, dummy female dogs or whatever?  Yeah, maybe they could fuck that.  It's a guy's fish with dog pussy juice sprayed on it.  I've seen that.  I've seen that with other animals.  They actually come up with apparatuses, so it's not awkward where you're just sitting 
[01:27:30]  there jerking off this animal to get its sperm.  If you're doing that.  Did the dog enjoy it, or was he just sitting there like, eh, I'm right?  Yeah, he kind of just sits there like that.  That's his job.  He's the stud.  He impregnates a lot of women.  All right.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, all right.  See ya.  That could have been hot if it was her jerking off the dogs, at least, right?  Yeah.  Nice German accent. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, good.  Back to the cat daddy.  See how he solves the problem.  Well, this cat's name is Bear, I guess.  Very mean.  Very mean.  Yeowing quite loudly.  Hissing.  Oh, boy, is it?  This cat doesn't take any guff.  And we're also getting on the phones, you've got to Google cat bite images.  No, maybe not.  Why?  This is, what's that?  Coldies.  Oh, I want a Coldies.  A Coldies, um, drops.  Oh, drops.  Lozenges.  This is a good lozenge. 
[01:28:30]  Lozenge.  This is honey lemon lozenge.  Lozenges.  I enjoy a good Coldies lozenge.  Sometimes you get sick right at it.  It's fucking annoying.  It's terrible.  All right, let's go to Bear.  See how Cat Daddy takes care of Bear.  He's lit.  Stop.  That thing's got a problem.  I'm Hannah.  Hi, Hannah.  I'm Johnny.  Johnny.  And we've been dating for a year.  Oh, boy.  I'm happier than I've been in any relationship. 
[01:29:00]  All right, then get rid of the fucking cat.  I already know what's happening.  I would like to see this progress, and he could be the one.  The cat's not used to seeing a white cock in the house.  And, you know, one of the few things that we actually ever do argue about is her cat.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  If we could get that sorted out, we're sad.  It bites his balls while he's swinging them in her face.  You're doing crazy, Bear.  This is you, Ant, with the cute little cat.  Love cute kitten.  Aw, look at the kittens.  Frolicking.  This is how it can get with you.  I know.  It's so fun to let them bite you and play with your hands. 
[01:29:30]  They're adorable when they do that.  Yeah.  They just, ah, little cat claws.  It's so adorable.  Get a little older, and it hurts a little more.  All right.  Well, let's see what happens, because I think this is your...  Maybe.  What is slowly happening to you.  Wait until he weighs 17 pounds and is taking shits on the floor, because his litter is too  dirty for him.  No!  They clean his litter box.  They clean that shit right up.  Exactly.  You make a little sandwich out of it.  Eat it.  Show us the cat you care.  A litter duty sandwich.  Melt.  I like to play and kind of roll around, and, you know, monkey was just as playful as bear 
[01:30:00]  was.  They're cute little bundles of joy.  Three months old now.  See, they're a little bigger.  I didn't notice any bad behavior.  And it wasn't until probably about three or four months later that bear was a little more  aggressive.  Let him on solo, man.  This is what you're going to have to deal with. 
[01:30:30]  He'll sink his teeth into your hand.  Out of nowhere.  And start kangarooing you with his back legs.  Whoa.  She showed me she had a little rash on her arm, and I said, oh, that looks like ringworm.  I freaked out.  And she freaked out.  She said, no, no, it's not ringworm.  And then it started spreading.  Oh, man.  And so she went to the doctor, I think, and he said, oh, yeah, that's ringworm.  Ew.  Oh, the cat gave her ringworm.  He likes to claw on my chair.  Oh, my God.  He likes to chew laptop chargers. 
[01:31:00]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Well, time to eat a new cord.  Smoke him.  The cord's smoking.  It's really crazy when guests come to the house.  I mean, he just, something clicks, and he just becomes vicious.  Wow.  Everything's scratched up in their house.  Now he started attacking my poor Boston Terrier.  Get rid of the fucking cat.  Yeah, the cat is shit.  This is shit cat.  The cat is fucking with the dog.  That's a giant cat, too.  I don't want to submit him to that, so. 
[01:31:30]  Could you pause?  I'd love to know how good she sucks dick.  He tolerates her awful cat, and his girlfriend is ringworm.  Right.  Ringworm.  Jesus.  And an awful cat.  Where did you meet her?  In a flower drop in Kenya?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Yeah, that's too much.  That's what's coming between you, a vicious cat.  You put the cat outside.  What you do is you put it outside.  Make it an outdoor cat.  Throw food out there once in a while.  You grab that cat by the scruff of his neck, and you physically pick him up, and you scream 
[01:32:00]  at him.  It will fucking bite you and scratch you.  No, no, but I mean by the, and you threaten him, and you make him terrified of you.  No, cats don't understand that emotion.  Oh, they'll understand.  Cats are never terrified.  Well, they are.  They're scared of cats, but they're not, they're not going to learn, is what I'm saying.  Might be too late.  Yeah.  For this one.  That's like saying, you got a bad kid, you punch him in his face, he'll never do it again.  Fucking belt him.  Fuck.  Exactly.  You know what?  He won't.  Yeah, but that kid will act out.  Well, let the cat act out.  Let him scratch something.  Get a leg beaten.  The legs get broken next time, right? 
[01:32:30]  Absolutely.  No cat is worth it.  Wow.  To that point.  This cat really sucks up.  It's a horrible cat.  She's only had a, well, what?  11 months.  Cat caretaker.  She got rid of it at that point.  She's a cat owner.  Rid of them.  And then that made me feel like he didn't love my cat, so it was just sort of like a  sensitive issue.  The signs are all there.  She's a lunatic.  Run!  He doesn't have to love your cat, you dummy.  And you don't understand why he might not love a cat that's ripping at his fucking calves 
[01:33:00]  as he's just trying to get a snack at night?  I'm fucking harassing his dog that he does love.  Yeah.  He tries to put his dick in my ass, and then it's just my ringworm.  I think he's poking his penis into my ringworm circle.  And he goes down and he eats my ringworm-y vag until I orgasm.  And I cough up what we call a cumball in cat terminology.  She's like, a nasty cat and ringworm in shitty furniture.  What a catch.  He's got a ring around the head of his penis. 
[01:33:30]  He's got ringworm on his cock.  He's making the classic mistake.  Every new relationship is just, everything's amazing.  The other person does nothing wrong, right?  But you've got to look for those signs, because eventually that amazingness does kind of settle  down.  And then you're left with a lunatic.  Well, this is a good sign.  This lady's a lunatic.  She's crazy.  Because she doesn't understand why the guy might not like her fucking cat.  No.  Might not love her cat.  Love, love.  She wants him to love the cat.  Cat sucks, lady. 
[01:34:00]  Let's go.  You know, it'll stop us from spending the night together, because I feel like I need to  take care of my cat.  He doesn't want to bring his dog over to have a cat attack his dog.  So, um, definitely has prevented us from spending as much time together as we would  like.  Oh, man.  Life.  Getting to the point where it is.  No intimacy.  I'll bet you that's reality show bullshit.  You think?  I'll bet you there was one night when that happened, and they're like, well, does it never  hurt your time together? 
[01:34:30]  And they went like, no.  Not really.  How about you talk about the one time it did?  It gives the story a little...  Yeah, yeah.  We need that.  Some legs.  Uh-huh.  Some producer was saying that.  That sounds like the type of thing, well, I'll have to take care of my cat, and he'll  take care of his dog.  One time, uh, yeah, he had his dick in me, and I pushed him away because my cat was yelling.  Yeah, one time, uh, you know, on 9-11, I was going to do something to my cat.  Shut up.  I'm trying to tie your cat into everything.  Dumb cat.  Oh, this woman.  I love my cat because he is getting in the way of my relationship. 
[01:35:00]  It's upsetting because I'm the one person that puts up with him, and then he's, you know,  sorry, I'm getting so emotional.  Fuck yeah.  I feel like I have sort of an obligation to him, but nobody else is going to feel the  same way that I do.  No.  I mean, I give him to a pound.  He's a monster.  To be a lonely cat lady.  If they don't adopt him out, then he has to be put down.  Well, you catch a cunt. 
[01:35:30]  How else are you going to learn?  I don't want to give up on him.  Fuck him.  Oh, yeah.  Here he comes.  Daddy the rescue.  Here he comes.  We'll tat it up.  He's in his convertible.  I'm never sure what to expect.  But whether I'm dealing with hyperactivity or aggression, I'm always here.  Guitar case.  Hi.  Guitar case.  What a douche.  That's what he's doing.  Not what I expected when I opened the door.  He's got catnip in his guitar case.  I don't think I was expecting.  Yeah, he's got, well, let's go to the catnip.  And poppers. 
[01:36:00]  Amyl nitrate.  Yes, I understand it from what I know, is that his aggression is pretty off the charts.  Or it can be.  Yeah.  He's unpredictable, yeah.  His big problem is when new people come into the house.  Could you pause for a second?  Could you imagine how emasculating it is for this guy sitting on the couch with his new  girl, relatively new girl, as a cat fucking counselor guy comes over?  A cat douche, yeah.  And he's got to sit there and be like, well, yes, it's very aggressive. 
[01:36:30]  Fuck that!  And she has to say, and a lot of times he can't maintain his erections and satisfy me  sexually because the cat's meowing in the other room.  Now, he is willing to prep you if you want to come over here and take care.  Would you ever be that guy on the couch?  Never!  Never!  And by that he means someone in a happy and loving relationship.  Oh, well, true there.  There's enough shit.  Oh, my God.  There's enough shit you've got to deal with in a relationship.  That's an easy one.  Get rid of your lunatic cat. 
[01:37:00]  Do you understand how Koreans would watch this and be like, I don't understand.  It's as if we're watching a show and they're discussing a hamburger sitting on a table to somebody.  Right.  It's like, well, the hamburger, I love the hamburger.  Right.  But, uh, it's being a little mean.  Like, people all over the world would look at this and go, this is over a cat?  Yeah, exactly.  It just shows that she has maybe some emotional issues.  Oh, just a tad.  He looks like a caged animal, um, claws and hisses and grunts at people who come over to the house that he doesn't know. 
[01:37:30]  And it's the point where you don't want to be within two or three feet of him.  You have to watch your feet.  He's going to scratch you.  Uh-oh.  This is exactly what little Beavis does.  Whether that be positive or negative.  And all of this stress and all of this anxiety that Hannah and Johnny are bringing to the situation is making Bear that much worse.  Has Bear always been a problem? 
[01:38:00]  After he was neutered, his aggression levels went up and his playfulness didn't really go away.  Was he aggressive before the surgery?  No, not like he's aggressive now.  So really, he's not neutered.  I know what happens.  Oh, my God.  He's fucking mad they took his pecker.  I know I would be.  Every day I'd be running around going, where the fuck is my pecker?  Scratch, scratch, meow.  I got to have Beavis fixed, you know?  I got to have his fucking balls cut off at some point. 
[01:38:30]  I guess December, around there.  It's got to be a little older, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you got to let them fucking nuts do something, you know?  They kind of help with the whole maturing process, I gather.  Do you see his little balls when he runs around?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's sad to see him go the first time.  Is it?  Yeah.  He's so cute.  You probably kiss him.  Why, you kind of like him?  No, I'm not kissing my cat's balls.  You're not an asshole with your nose, and you kiss his balls.  That's his elixir that calms him down.  When he's meowing, Ann has to put his nose in the cat's asshole, exactly a quarter inch, 
[01:39:00]  and do this on his balls.  Is that what I'm doing?  Damn it.  Yeah, because your nose in the asshole vibrates when you kiss the ball.  Oh.  Comforts him.  Okay.  Times of fear.  All right.  Are they the whole episode?  No.  Oh, good.  Let's see what happens.  Yeah, let's see what the fuck happens.  How does he fix this?  There's no fixing that.  He missed some tissue the first time around, so he was still producing testosterone.  Two invasive surgeries, like neuterings, would traumatize any cat, so it makes sense that 
[01:39:30]  Bear's acting out.  Oh, see.  It's a pretty extreme case, and it's going to take a lot of effort, not just on my part,  but on your part as well.  I can't be bothered with effort.  If you guys are ready to go, I think we can make a difference in his life and in your life.  I guarantee it doesn't help in the end.  He's in the bedroom.  He'll get something cool for the show.  He'll get a day where he is fine.  Yeah, yeah.  Spend some one-on-one time with him, okay?  Okay.  And I will be back in just a little bit. 
[01:40:00]  But Beavis is a people person.  He's a cat, another person.  All right, don't worry about that.  Watch your toes.  He loves company.  Why does he think there's a guitar case with him?  That's all.  It's good.  You guys rock and roll, man.  Throw it all the way.  Whoa.  Is that Mr. Bear?  It just comes out with a broken neck.  There, I fixed it.  He grabs it by the tail and throws it out the door.  Cats, come.  Oh, shit.  He's a taxidermist.  I felt bad.  You don't have to come say hi. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, come on.  You're not talking to him.  I hear you, I hear you.  I hear you, I hear you.  Holy shit.  This is not helping.  Okay.  Do it barefoot, tough guy.  Yeah.  Cat's under the bed.  That is the nastiest cat.  He's opening up his guitar case.  What has he got?  Some treats.  This is what we're going to do.  You got to let me see you.  What's he doing?  The first thing I do with any aggressive cat is to make sure they don't see me as a threat. 
[01:41:00]  So I will back up, get them used to my voice and not my body.  I'll make myself as small as possible.  I'll lay down.  I'll just try to make sure they know that there are a lot of threats out there, but I'm not one of them.  Oh, right.  Come on, Bubba.  The food doesn't.  If I soften my eyes, do a slow blink.  What?  Once they return that look to me.  Oh.  They fall in love.  Oh. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  I'm in.  Wow, the cat blinked.  Oh, hi.  It's like editing.  It's all done through editing.  By giving him something like food.  With fucking cyanide in it.  What is that?  It's something to make the room trustworthy with me in it.  Yeah.  That he can be eating and say, ah, good things happen whenever there's a stranger in the room.  Yeah, but he knows people are going to buy it.  You want some more?  He's probably right, though.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah.  I think he's right here. 
[01:42:00]  Nice.  Oh, now he's listening at him again.  Yeah, it worked.  I guess it worked, huh?  Back to his again.  Oh, he got him.  He bit him.  Bear attacked my hand because he was already in fight or flight.  He was cornered and he felt like the whole world was out to get him.  Oh, I see.  I wanted to see how far...  This guy sounds like every liberal with criminals.  I found out.  No, it's the problem.  The problem is the other people.  Look at the root cause of this cat's anger.  The cat has been impoverished his entire life.  Oh, God.  Ouch. 
[01:42:30]  From my perspective, what I'm seeing is a body that is so tensed up from being in fight  or flight, that the voice box, everything gets so stressed.  That...  I got to tell you, I've never seen that before.  Nice.  So, that tells you how bad it is.  All right.  Tell me, get rid of the cat.  That's the thing.  I mean, he feels powerless.  Get rid of the cat.  He has no choice but to strike out.  The old IV of the old blue fluid.  Okay, so now what I'd like to do is bring one of you guys back in the room. 
[01:43:00]  Bye-bye.  So, whoever you want that to be.  Definitely Hannah.  Yeah, he's like...  I'm going to go out and hang out with my friends.  I don't want to see how he interacts with Hannah.  So I'm going to bring her into the room.  I'm going to try to find my fucking dick and balls again.  Yeah, I'm going to try to find a girl that's not broken.  Right, right.  You enjoy her and her fucking lunatic cat.  I'm going back to Hooters.  This is the Guy Fieri of fucking animals.  Oh, hi.  Hi, bear.  I'm trying to get him all the way out.  And then he's going to tackle her. 
[01:43:30]  The thing that we're doing is balancing comfort and challenge.  See, the boyfriend walks in to the bedroom and those two are just fucking.  The cat's licking her asshole.  The cat guy is fucking his girlfriend.  Yeah.  Going, he's cured.  Yeah, yeah, he's fine.  And he's sucking the ringworm out of her.  And then he goes, what?  What?  This is my technique.  What?  That's what we do.  I'm gaining the cat's trust.  You should have read the fine print.  This is what I do.  What?  That's how they talk to you.  If I'm fucking your girlfriend, see the cat will trust me. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  And without having a constructive out for that energy, it just builds and builds.  Is this guy still babbling?  And his tail switches around.  He's letting you know, energetically, I am like a balloon ready to pop.  Great.  Oh, man.  And sure enough, Bear got really overstimulated and back under the bed again to a safe place  where he can decompress.  I get overstimulated and go under the bed.  I come all over myself.  I just want to fill you in on some of the things that I saw in there.  Bear is a confident cat when he doesn't feel cornered.  How do you know? 
[01:44:30]  When he's not under something.  How do you know?  I want him to be up.  What do you mean?  I want to see Bear have access to vertical spaces.  What do you mean when he feels cornered?  This is supposed to be a safe place.  Right.  It's home.  He has confidence knowing he can move around his space.  Yes.  Without being threatened, without being trapped.  Right.  This way, we can start introducing people, family, friends, strangers, without him beating  up anybody.  No, this guy's.  He's right.  I would love to see this room where he can traverse up here.  What?  And go around this room without touching the floor. 
[01:45:00]  What?  They're going to build a fucking...  So he can attack them above?  Yeah.  He's saying, you know, welcome.  You know what I mean?  Yes, of course.  He doesn't feel that need to run because there's escape routes everywhere.  Do they honestly have to put something up so this cat can walk along the walls?  So the next thing that we're going to do is start to work with the concept that in cats,  a natural release is to hunt and kill things.  I think you guys should move out and get an apartment and leave the house for the cat.  He needs his own place.  He needs his own space.  Yeah, he doesn't like you.  And that's going to be your legs or your hands or your friends. 
[01:45:30]  So the first thing that I want to bring out is my favorite toy.  Play is...  It's a big butt plug.  Yeah.  We're programming his body here again.  We're still going with Nixon's face on the head.  Hunt, catch, kill, eat, right?  I don't even care anymore.  Go right to the end and see what happened.  I have to go.  Do you want to hear the cutest thing?  Yeah.  When I was a kid and I was talking about my cat, I think I've told the story,  but instead of personality, I would say he has cat malady. 
[01:46:00]  Hey, you.  How cute is that?  Was that in my touching?  I'll see you guys tomorrow.  Where are you going, Jimmy?  I got to work.  Jim's got a gig.  Is it a good gig?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be back tomorrow.  Remember, take a little sandpaper so the hole doesn't make splinters in your lips.  I always make it so big that there's no way a cock could fit all the way in and jam the sides. 
[01:46:30]  So the gentlemen can pull their balls through, too?  Yeah.  It's not a glory hole if you can't yank the bag through.  Yank the bag through.  That would be horrible.  Funk.  Yank the bag through.  Take it easy, Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy.  See you tomorrow, man.  There he goes.  How much longer on this cat piece? 
[01:47:00]  I don't even care.  I just want to see maybe the end of this segment.  All right, fast forward.  See how nice the cat is.  You think the cat will be nice or it'll be like one of those things where you can tell  that he's still fucked up?  Wait, we might be near the end.  Is that around the end?  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Hi, Jackson.  Come on in.  Oh, here's the update.  Jackson, how are you?  I'm great, man.  How are you doing?  I'm pretty good.  I am absolutely stunned.  And over the moon.  The cat's sitting up there. 
[01:47:30]  That's his new favorite place up there.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  Really?  Bear is on top of the cabinet now.  He's relaxed.  He's confident.  Good boy.  Most importantly, he's owning the room.  You didn't get to see this inside of him before.  No, I've never seen this.  Plus, when he's up there like that and he's up here and he's more relaxed, then my dog,  Frankie, can be more relaxed, too.  He is just learning right now that life can be led without hypervigilance.  No, he's not.  I just can't believe that that cat who was under the bed when I first came over, who really 
[01:48:00]  beat my hand up.  The black and white footage of the horrible times.  Exposing his belly to me and giving me lovey eyes.  How about you go up and pet it?  I'm pretty blown away.  How about you fucking pet it?  That is all we wanted to show him.  That's all I wanted to show him.  We had some people over the other night.  Some friends and family.  They're in the hospital now.  Did you really?  Yeah.  There was actually some improvements.  Good.  Can I see it?  Oh, no.  They're talking about improvement. 
[01:48:30]  Improvement.  That means there's still problems.  I had my mom and my two sisters and my stepdad and Johnny.  And me.  And Frank.  And Frank.  And Frank.  To see him lying on his back like that, surrounded by people, basically saying to all of you,  I'm vulnerable.  You can't touch this cat still.  Which is what that universal cat finally.  They're bullshitting.  The woman can.  Is astounding.  I am absolutely over the moon about Hannah's progress with Bear. 
[01:49:00]  Progress.  About her energetic approach to him.  All those words.  But now, I want to see how she can do with play.  There's still some work to be done.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  The cat jumps up on things.  They had to clear off their mantle for the cat.  Fuck you.  He has no reason to feel trapped or threatened anymore.  His confidence is back.  And now, we can all see that playful cat that Hannah remembers.  Playful cat.  Go up.  Go up.  Scratch him on the head.  Because Frankie's sitting right here.  Give him a shukka shukka.  Doesn't even care. 
[01:49:30]  No.  No.  And there's nothing that can bother him right now.  Look at his body like Joe's arms tucked in.  Exactly.  Frankie's not going to get in his way.  I really think this has been a positive experience.  Positive experience.  We've spent a lot more time together.  Johnny will stay without having to pack up his bags and leave.  This is why I love what I do.  Take a cat who most people think is a lost cause and totally turn his life around.  Over here, Bear.  Jackson's taught me how to speak to cats.  So, I feel like I can actually believe his body language and better anticipate what he's 
[01:50:00]  going to do so I know how to react to Bear.  The cat's a monster?  They didn't show anyone else but her touching the cat.  Obviously.  It's a mess.  All right.  That's a lunatic cat.  I don't know.  What do you think?  Oh, no.  If I'm fucking dealing with that.  I was ready to say I was wrong.  I'll drop kick it.  But how he was talking there, there's still problems. 
[01:50:30]  There's huge problems.  There's still huge problems.  But they had a, you know, it's a TV show.  They've got to make it all nice in the end.  Most telling thing.  No one touched the cat.  Yeah.  They need two minutes where the cat's behaving.  And then, look, see?  She's playing with it.  They made the big thing that she was wiggling a fucking thing on a stick and the fucking  cat jumped up on something.  Any cat will do that.  Right.  A lion will do that.  Notice she's still eight feet away from the cat.  This is a fishing rod, basically.  Jeez.  I don't know.  Good luck to you, Ant.  I think that's your future. 
[01:51:00]  I can't wait.  I need the cat daddy.  You do.  You will be honest and you will come in here with the turn, right?  Oh, absolutely.  I'll let you know.  There's going to be a turn.  A turn?  Where one day you go, all right, look, and you're going to just, like, you know, roll  up your sleeve.  I got a few wounds.  Yeah, you got basic cat wounds.  That's fine.  A little wound there.  Yeah, that's normal.  That's normal, though.  Yeah, yeah.  But I can't wait for the day to turn.  Look, man, I'm scared shitless in my own hole.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Well, I get him to stop.  I grab his head, right?  Yeah.  I grab his body and I push him down on the couch and I'll hold him there and be like,  no!  And just hold him there for a while.  And then let him up.  And if he does again, I do it again.  I'm superior.  I'm the alpha male.  You got to alpha male those little motherfuckers.  And then he fucking walks away after a little while.  And he goes, oh.  Okay.  Yeah, he's like, oh, I can't fuck with this guy.  Oh.  Fuck.  Yeah.  But he's good.  He doesn't scratch the shit. 
[01:52:00]  He doesn't scratch the furniture.  You know, he doesn't pull all that.  He's gonna, though.  Shit.  He doesn't do that at all?  He doesn't knead everything?  He doesn't do the kneading thing at all.  Why?  None of that.  I don't know.  That breed doesn't do it, maybe?  I don't know.  If he ever scratches anything, it's only his little cat house that he's got.  And he fucking scratches on that.  But he doesn't scratch any of the furniture, the rugs, nothing.  Yeah.  All right.  I think you got to get his nails removed.  No, I clip him.  I clipped him the other day.  He was a little more energetic than he was the first time I clipped him when he was little. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Now I grab him.  I put him, like, between my knees.  And I'm fucking trying to grab one hand.  He's going, meow.  And I'm like, clip, clip, clip, clip.  But that's what you would do if they tried to take your guns away.  Oh, yeah.  That's his guns.  That's his guns.  You're trying to take away his weapons.  I'm fucking, I'm the Governor Cuomo.  Or fucking cats of the house.  Exactly.  So I think you should understand that one.  All right.  Why is the only pussy we talk about is cats? 
[01:53:00]  Are you really going to?  What?  I bounce people from the Pal Talk room for making the pussy slash cat joke.  What's up?  Hey, why are we only talking about pussy cats anymore?  Isn't there any other kind of pussy we can talk about?  I don't understand.  If we replace the kitty cat with, like, some 18-year-old stank in the story, it would be much better.  Um, 18-year-old stank. 
[01:53:30]  No, stank.  Not stank.  That's what I meant.  Stank.  I heard stank.  Who the fuck talks like that?  Jesus.  I know who.  Douche bags.  Douche?  Is it the douche bag?  Yes.  Kind of a...  Mike, what are you doing?  Hey, talk about some 18-year-old stank.  I was, uh...  What a degrading fucking term.  I was very entertained by this whole, uh, animal break.  I think we got a lot done here.  Oh, fucking dog, cat daddy. 
[01:54:00]  Matt, Mike.  What's your name?  Matt?  All right, Matt.  All right, we'll, uh, we'll try to get some 18-year-old stank on the show.  And what do we do with the 18-year-old stank when it comes in here?  Uh, whatever you guys want.  Ah.  I trust your creativity.  Yeah.  I see.  Apparently not, Hank.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks, Matt.  Hey, have a good one, fellas.  All right.  There's...  There's...  There's someone that just... 
[01:54:30]  I can't picture him with a girl.  Like, you can't be like, yeah!  I got myself some stank last night.  I'm going out with some stank tonight.  You know what that means.  You know, she's gonna want dinner and shit like that, but I'm just gonna fuck her.  Right in her stank.  What is stank?  Is it skank slash what?  No.  I would assume he means...  Some good pussy, right?  Stank some good pussy.  Right, right, right.  Where it smells, but not a bad way. 
[01:55:00]  Right?  What a fucking douchebag.  Can we call him a tool?  It's...  He's a tool.  You're a tool.  He's a douchebag.  Oh, God.  What an awful word.  Iraq?  Remember DeRosa said that to me in Montreal when I saw him downstairs at the bar?  Did he?  Oh, right.  Yeah, I do.  He's gonna check out all this stank.  Stank.  I think people that use the word stank don't really get a lot of pussy.  No.  I am willing to bet they do not get a lot. 
[01:55:30]  And that's their cover-up.  And I'm not saying they're not getting pussy because they're mysterious.  They're just not getting the pussy.  So they have to use words like stank.  Ugh.  It's like nugget.  All right.  That word stank is equal to nugget in the ehh kind of category.  What's wrong with nugget?  It's terrible.  It just conjures up the image of that last little fucking dollop of shit that falls in  the toilet.  That's why it's called a nugget. 
[01:56:00]  It goes bloop.  Or the piece that didn't flush as it comes back.  Oh.  Ah, yes.  The nugget.  Terrible.  Or sometimes the nugget's just a little cork being popped and then all hell breaks loose.  You could have a nugget to begin the whole process.  Or you could have it as the last.  It could be.  As a bit of something something.  Is that like fucking.  After having sex with some stank.  Same rules as aloha.  Yes.  You could say it coming or going.  Yes.  Exactly.  Like hello or goodbye.  You know what I'm talking about, though. 
[01:56:30]  Yes, of course.  Sometimes you got a rough one and all of a sudden that little, the cork pops.  Ah.  Finally.  Thank God.  All right.  Yeah.  We're going to talk about some other things.  Oh, yeah.  I'd like to.  Oh, we do have Jack Tober.  We've got a little Jack Tober in.  You do want to do Jack Tober?  Oh, yeah.  You sure?  We missed yesterday.  And.  How was the DL?  And how was the John Lithgow?  DL, fun.  Great as usual.  I like when DL comes in.  He's a fun fucking guy.  Very funny guy. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  And John Lithgow, very, you know.  Oh, he's an actor.  Very, you know.  Sort of.  He was a little.  Um.  I don't want to say uptight because he was fine.  What's that?  Because I made a couple of jokes.  Reserved?  Yes.  Reserved.  Well, he doesn't want to fuck up his career.  He's a little reserved.  He's got like a shitload of kids books out.  I was like, oh, what inspired you to write a kid's book?  He goes, oh, I wrote ten of them.  And I turned the book over.  And there he is with ten of his books.  I'm like, oh, shit.  Maybe I should have known that.  Why would you? 
[01:57:30]  I guess.  I would know because I should have read the fucking bio.  I guess.  You know.  I never read the bio.  Turned the book over and saw the covers of all the other books on the back.  Maybe that.  Maybe that.  No.  No.  But it's John Lithgow.  You would have known he was writing books.  So why don't we know that he's writing kids books?  No.  Are they fucking not doing well?  No.  I think they do very well.  Name one.  I don't know.  Because I'll tell you right now.  I got two kids and easily 200 kids books in my house right now.  Wow.  No joke.  And I know I don't have a John Lithgow.  No.  What books did he write, E-Rock? 
[01:58:00]  I don't know the books, but I know his music did really well.  The kids songs.  Yeah, he does like kids songs.  He had a big kids album about 10 years ago.  Songs from the Bathtub or something like that.  Look at all of his books.  Let me see his books.  I'll tell you.  Nope.  I got two dogs.  Nope.  Not in my house.  Macabre.  Nope.  No.  Marsupial Sioux.  I was reading some fucking Dr. Seuss the other day.  Yeah.  That's just utter nonsense.  Oh, yeah.  A little made-up animal names and words and shit. 
[01:58:30]  I know.  Utter nonsense.  I know it was his gig, but I don't have to accept it.  No.  It was that one fish, two fish, green fish, blue fish, whatever the fuck.  Red fish, blue fish.  Red fish, blue fish.  You ever read that?  They needed the money.  I was reading it, and it's not meant for you.  I'm reading it to my kid, and I had to finally tell him this is nonsense.  Let's get a better book.  Oh.  He says people call him John Cleese.  Why?  When he walks down the street, he kind of does have a John Cleese look about him when 
[01:59:00]  you see him in person.  A little bit.  Like, you can mistake him for him.  He does all these readings.  He's going to be in Huntington.  Oh, really?  At the book review.  The good old book review.  Yeah.  He's going to do a little thing where he does a little musical stuff for the kids.  And the aunt did plug the restaurant.  Jimmy did, yeah.  Oh, Jimmy did.  Jimmy did.  He said, oh, that's right down the road from my Facebook list.  Why didn't you plug it?  Because Jimmy did.  And then... 
[01:59:30]  I have to go there.  I haven't been there in a while.  Ooh.  Oh.  And then, yeah, because I said something like, he said, do I have kids?  And I said, no, my womb is barren.  Right.  That's funny.  He didn't.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't he laugh at that?  I said, I had a couple of other ones.  Is he a funny guy, you think?  Well.  Or is he like a serious guy?  He's a nice man.  He's a nice man.  He's a legend.  There you go.  He's been around forever.  A nice man.  We talked a lot about the Twilight Zone movie and his Nightmare at 30,000 Feet. 
[02:00:00]  Right on.  As compared to a Nightmare at 20,000 Feet with Shatner.  Sure.  The fact that Shatner was in Third Rock from the Sun.  And we talked about Bill Shatner a little bit.  But why do they have to pump it up 10,000 Feet?  Well, because I guess, you know, back in the Twilight Zone days, the original one, that was pretty much cruising altitude.  All right.  But let's just make it 20,000.  And then 35,000 Feet was cruising altitude during the...  Does it matter if it's more than 100 feet off the ground?  Well, Nightmare at 100 feet doesn't sound very scary.  It could be, you know, you're on some kind of a platform or a ladder. 
[02:00:30]  You know.  There's a man on the rung.  But 20,000 to 30,000 makes a difference?  That's pretty scary because you're up there.  You know you're not landing soon, is what it is.  Like 35,000 Feet, you're like, there's a nightmare.  Something's happening.  It's not like, well, at least we're landing and I'll get off of this thing.  When do you hate, when you're flying, like, when do you hate it?  I hate when they go really high.  My stupid brain.  I'm like, if we're just above the clouds, I'm like, oh, okay.  I like this.  Really high.  I hate when they go really high.  But when you look down and the clouds are way the fuck down, I hate that. 
[02:01:00]  You don't like that?  No.  I feel way more secure when I'm just above the clouds.  I like the whole procedure.  You like going way high?  Yeah.  I love when they finally level out.  I like being on that plane, fucking first class, getting my drink on.  I know it's all nonsense.  But when you're coming in for landing and you're just above the clouds and then you go under the clouds,  but you're still a good thousand feet off the ground, I just feel very safe at that point. 
[02:01:30]  Well, you know.  That's nonsense.  Most crashes occur right near the ground.  Right near the ground.  Well, we're going to talk about Loda.  Loda.  Loda Loda.  And de Blasio had their debate, I guess, and they got at each other.  And, of course, de Blasio pulling out the race card again.  Boy, he loves his son's afro.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That sneaky fuck is now getting his daughter involved, who also is, you know. 
[02:02:00]  Of course.  Of that same origin.  His wife is so black that his kids barely, barely got any of his whiteness.  Yeah.  Have you seen the daughter's commercial yet?  No.  It just popped.  It might have popped just yesterday.  Oh, we'll have to see that.  It's a whole thing.  Two guns.  And then she makes fun of her brother for getting all the attention.  And then it's like, hey, what about me?  Really?  He's pulling another black kid.  Uh-huh.  Because he knows how well the afro kid did. 
[02:02:30]  So he's like, all right, afro kid, now I go with the daughter.  Afro kid.  Afro kid.  We'll play it after the break.  Yes.  Find that one, Sam.  We'll play it after the break.  This spot just hit either yesterday or the day before.  And, of course, de Blasio and Loda.  Some pretty surprising things came from the debate.  We got one clip.  Yeah.  It's for the mayor.  The mayor.  In New York City for the people that don't know.  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh, damn.  We'll play the commercial next.  I miss her to get in trouble describing her hair. 
[02:03:00]  It's a bit.  Not kempt.  Her hair's a bit.  Iraq, what's the matter with you?  Hit it.  I was seeing where he was going with it.  To the dumpster.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show. 
[02:03:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  What the hell is this?  I don't know.  What is this, Iraq?  Foster the People.  All right.  Sounds good.  There's a song that they're using for a commercial now.  I can't tell you the product or anything like that.  But I did notice in the background of this song, very subtly, is Godzilla's roar.  Really?  They're sampling it?  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Godzilla's fucking roar is sampled.  Now I got to hear this.  I think it's some kind of, maybe a car or insurance.  I don't know.  But it's there.  I thought it was pretty cool.  I heard it.  I was like, oh.  Does anyone know the commercial?  I don't know.  Because we're about to talk about the other.  Oh, yeah.  That's the classic.  That's it.  It's the very beginning of it.  Eh?  Really?  Yeah.  Play the very beginning.  Right there.  That is sampled.  Oh, wow.  In a song.  Now I need to know. 
[02:04:30]  I know, right?  A song in a commercial.  Oh, I wish somebody would.  So actually, someone sampled for a song.  Yeah, yeah.  And now they're using that song in a commercial?  It's in a commercial.  So it's so underneath the song, though.  Got it.  It's like barely there.  But growing up, such a Godzilla fan.  What song is?  Oh, is that what it is?  It's from 2007.  Oh, okay.  It might be an older song.  Who knows?  It might be an older song that they're just reworking to a commercial now.  Are you excited for the new Godzilla movie?  Oh, I heard about that, right? 
[02:05:00]  It's a...  Bryan Cranston's in it?  Yeah.  And it's more classic Godzilla than...  Yeah, it sticks to the original story and the type.  The first Bueller version.  You didn't like the remake?  No, I didn't.  It was a Boston.  It wasn't Godzilla.  It was such a shame, I know.  It was some other fucking iguana monster.  It was great up until you actually saw it.  Like when you saw the West Side Highway being ripped up with the pierce.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But then when you actually saw it, it's just...  Oh, it's a big lizard.  Yeah, it looked like fucking an iguana.  I don't want that.  I want Godzilla.  There was no Cloverfield. 
[02:05:30]  I like when Godzilla used to get mad and he'd fucking shake his hands.  Get all mad.  His head would go...  And he'd fucking show like a professional wrestler.  He's like...  He was hulking up.  And then he fucking like...  They'd have him run and then go to drop kick some other monster.  And he'd just be flying through the air like on his back.  It was believable though.  With his tail dragging on the ground.  It looked ridiculous.  No, it was very believable.  But it was...  And his spikes would glow from charging up.  It was great. 
[02:06:00]  I remember one time I was watching Godzilla when I was a kid.  And it was the original Godzilla, the black and white one, where they shoehorned Raymond  Burr in to help with the American audience.  He wasn't even in it.  It was like a Godzilla movie made in Japan.  And then they wanted to sell it in America.  So they re-filmed.  They filmed scenes of Raymond Burr kind of looking out a window going, oh my God.  Right, right.  We need some English in this.  Yeah, yeah.  To say like, oh look, Raymond Burr's here.  So I was watching that one.  And my father was in the kitchen with all his friends. 
[02:06:30]  And they're drinking and talking and stuff.  And I remember at the end, spoiler alert, Godzilla dies.  Oh, fuck.  The scientist uses his oxygen destroyer.  And it goes in the water and bubbles.  And you see Godzilla laying on the bottom.  And then there's bubbles, bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.  And the bubbles die down.  And then you see Godzilla's skeleton laying on the bottom.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, so they didn't leave you guessing?  No.  All of a sudden, the show one bubble, like maybe he's still alive.  No.  And then the credits roll.  The credits roll.  He was definitely dead.  Yeah.  So I was so fucking upset about this and heartbroken. 
[02:07:00]  No.  That I then, I got done.  I didn't cry.  I know.  I didn't cry.  But I walked in after the movie's over.  Yeah.  And my father goes, oh, how was Godzilla?  Yeah.  How was the movie?  How did it end?  What happened?  And I couldn't say that Godzilla died.  So I went, oh, they put him in suspended animation.  Because I didn't want to even accept the fact that they had killed him.  I wanted him in suspended animation.  But he didn't call you a faggot?  Were you crying or that shit? 
[02:07:30]  Let me think.  You were able to control your emotions that time?  That memory right there has no faggot in it whatsoever.  No.  The next time I hear you cry like that, you better have an arrow in your chest.  None of that.  And very good news.  You know how you're trying to figure out the song that's being sampled?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, we got Thor in Jersey.  Okay.  And he's got the answer.  Thor, what's up?  Hey. 
[02:08:00]  What's up, fellas?  Hey, buddy.  It's Bloor's the Cult's Godzilla, obviously, and it's a car commercial.  It starts off with some little pussy kid, and then all of a sudden it's a, you know,  they have the Godzilla sound, and then the song comes on in some badass car.  It wasn't Bloor's the Cult's Godzilla.  It's the only reason why.  I know Godzilla by Bloor's the Cult.  Yeah, that's.  It's the only reason why.  The only reason we took your call was to make you look stupid.  I know Godzilla. 
[02:08:30]  I know the song.  And it's talking about a newer song that has just a part of the sample in it.  Yes, it's a new song that samples the sound right at the, just the beginning of the sound.  We know Soft White Underbelly, sir.  Jeez, I've seen them perform this so many times, I can't even count.  I've seen the...  Huh?  How many times have you seen Blue Oyster Cult?  I can't even tell you.  I officially never saw a Blue Oyster Cult.  It had to be.  I saw Soft White Underbelly. 
[02:09:00]  Ah, at Hammerheads?  No, the one in Roslyn there.  Oh, my father's place?  My father's place.  It was a big secret show by Soft White Underbelly.  But of course, everyone knew Soft White Underbelly was Godzilla.  Dude, that's Blue Oyster Cult.  It's like, yeah, I know.  I mean, yeah, Blue Oyster Cult, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I used to like Blue Oyster Cult.  Oh, no.  I fucking loved Blue Oyster Cult.  They were great.  How deep you go with the band?  Pretty deep.  Really? 
[02:09:30]  Pretty deep.  Yeah, Flaming Telepaths.  Nope.  Meaning I don't think I know it.  Seven Screaming Diz Busters.  Astronomy.  Astronomy, I know.  Emmy 262.  I know the Veterans of the Psychic, Thousand Psychic Wars.  Oh, yes, of course.  I know that one.  It's good shit, man.  Burning for you?  I'm burning for you.  It was one of their hits.  The odd thing is, Eric Bloom was the singer for Blue Oyster Cult.  He sang like 99.9% of their songs. 
[02:10:00]  But the two hits they had, it was pretty much Donald Roser.  Yeah.  I didn't know this until right now.  But Dom are singing the hits.  Wait, he wasn't.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, he sang burning for you.  Then I don't know this.  Yeah.  Wait, the two hits were by the other guy that doesn't really sing?  Burn it for you and Don't Fear the Reaper.  Right.  Was, yeah, was Buck Dahmer, who's the guitar player, but not really the singer.  So the other douche sings all the songs that didn't really make it, and then he has to  kind of step backwards and let the other guy have.  Exactly.  Oh, that is so bad. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Why did I know this one?  I don't know.  It's just...  And is that how it works in concert?  All of a sudden, like, the guy that's been working his ass off singing now has to kind  of step backwards and let this guy get the glory for singing the hits?  Yeah.  And I liked Eric Bloom's voice better.  He had more of a rock voice.  What's the number one Eric Bloom's song?  Oh, man.  What would be, like, the number one Eric Bloom's voice?  See, he didn't even come close to having a hit?  No, really.  If you think about it...  That is so fucked up.  I didn't know this. 
[02:11:00]  Not really a big, like...  Damn, right?  I just assume this is the lead singer.  No, this is Buck Dormer singing this one.  He's got a more melodic, and Eric Bloom had a more raspy rock and roll kind of voice.  So who sang Godzilla?  I think that was Eric Bloom.  Okay, that might have been Eric Bloom.  Godzilla's a pretty big song.  Yeah.  Not like this, though.  No.  This was a big one.  And Don't Feel the Reef, it was really big.  This is like soft rock now. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, if you think about it.  Listen, right here.  You would consider this soft rock.  Oh, yeah.  Very easy riffs.  This plays on a light station now.  It has to.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you know for sure, or are you just saying...  No, I'm just saying.  Oh, you're just saying...  It probably would.  Even then, though, this was kind of one of their more mellow songs.  Don't Feel the Reaper and this were kind of there.  Ballads, if you think about it. 
[02:12:00]  Sure.  But the Eric Bloom songs, you know.  Shit like that.  Emmy 262.  Man, I just did not know that.  Yeah.  That's Buck Dorm.  Yeah.  So why didn't they sing all the shit?  Eric Bloom's is playing guitar like, eh, fuck.  All right, it'll be my turn again, but then I'm not going to know the next one.  I'm not going to know, fucking...  How do you do that?  This guy sings the big hit, and then it's like, okay, thank you for that.  And now I'll continue singing the rest of these crap songs that didn't do well.  He's got to sing fucking...  Yeah, all right.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  Eric, do Cities on Flame.  With Rock and Roll.  My heart is black, and my lips are cold.  That's a cool song.  Of course it is.  It's great.  And who does that one?  Play some Cities on Flame.  Is that Eric Bloom?  That's Eric Bloom.  Okay.  Now, let's get a...  Yeah.  So you're not...  I mean, he had some songs, but not radio hits.  Yeah.  Crank this fucker up.  Some stations played this.  This was good shit.  It's not a riff, man. 
[02:13:00]  Fuzzy guitar.  Yeah.  Here's Mr. Kumi checking in, Joey.  Tell him to hold on until he...  All right, hold on a second, Jerry.  We've got to hear the vocals.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  This isn't Eric Bloom.  No, that's Joe Bouchard.  Joe Bouchard.  Eric did the live version, right?  Or something?  Right.  So who's Joe Bouchard now?  He's the ex-drummer.  They threw him a bone.  Joe and Alvin Bouchard.  So they gave him a song, too, that was kind of popular.  So what song did Eric Bloom sing as the lead singer of Blue Oyster Cult, Joe? 
[02:13:30]  Eric Bloom sings live versions of...  Well, everything on your feet or on your knees.  The live version.  The live album.  Oh, the live version.  He does, like, Dominance and Submission.  He does...  He sings Godzilla live.  Yeah.  But was it his song on the record?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  But it's not...  It didn't fucking do as well as Burn It For You and Don't See The Reaper.  Yeah, no.  Those were the major...  Yeah, those were the...  And this one, which was kind of a cool song, he didn't do either. 
[02:14:00]  No, no.  This wasn't...  Doesn't he...  Didn't he do this live, though, Eric?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, he was...  The live version of that song is way more popular than the studio.  Yeah, yeah.  The studio version.  The live version came out when I was, like, 14.  Oh, man.  I was 14 years old.  That's back in the 40s when, I think, Hitler was still running things.  Yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Yeah.  Joe's actually...  Joe actually knows those guys now.  Yeah, we were...  Blue Oyster Cult guys.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  I auditioned for the band bass playing, but to play bass for them about, I guess it 
[02:14:30]  was about 15, 20 years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  I was way too tall.  He was too tall.  They loved...  Oh, I remember this story.  I knew every song.  They loved how he played, but he was too tall, because they were a bunch of pipsqueaks.  I remember they were really short.  They couldn't have some fucking...  I met him at Sparks, I think, was it?  One of those places, right?  Sparks, Spit, Cheers.  No, I think it was Sparks, and I remember, I couldn't believe how short they were.  Yeah.  Wait.  They played all those joints.  Joe, do you believe, then, that that was their excuse?  That was.  No, that was the reason. 
[02:15:00]  You were that much taller than them?  Yeah, I'm 6'1".  They're all, like, 5'5".  Yeah, they're little guys.  They didn't want some towering bass player over there.  They ended up choosing a guy named Danny Miranda, who was, like, right around their size.  No kidding.  Danny Miranda went on to play with Queen.  The new Queen.  Went on to play with those guys.  I got someone on the line saying there's a Joel Rifkin angle.  Was he really an early guitar player for Blue Oyster Cult?  There's no way that's true. 
[02:15:30]  Get out of here.  All right, hold on, Joe.  Hold on.  I got to hear this.  Yes, let me hear this.  Devin, come on, brother.  Devin, what do you got on this?  Hey, hey.  Look, I grew up on Long Island, and I just remember back in the day when all that was going on that  one of my mom's friends or whatever actually told me that he was one of the early guitarists  for Blue Oyster Cult.  Come on.  Joe Rifkin.  That's all I heard, man.  I don't know if it's true or not. 
[02:16:00]  Do you know, coincidentally enough, O.J. played with the O.J.  All right, Devin, thanks.  All right, guys.  Have a good time.  That's just one of those.  That was absurd.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  I wouldn't even call it absurd.  That's something you could get past people.  You could absolutely start that rumor, and people would bite.  Yeah, that's like a.  Oh, hey, guys.  Yeah.  Do you know who Marilyn Manson is?  Devin, what's the one to use?  Yeah, no, I swear you, the fucking Kevin Arnold's friend. 
[02:16:30]  Paul, thank you.  You're right.  Good old Paul.  Those guys went from selling out stadiums to pretty much playing the same venues I play  now.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Sparks was a small place when I saw them.  You saw them at, what, that place in Huntington?  Well, I just saw them at State Theater down in Virginia.  Oh, right, right.  And how are they?  You know, 500-seater.  They were good, but it's only Eric and Donald, really.  I mean, the rest of the band is long since gone or dead. 
[02:17:00]  You know, Alan Lanier just died.  Oh, Jesus.  He didn't look dead for years.  Jeez.  He was the keyboard player, guitar, like, you know.  Well, when does Joel Riffinger get out?  Maybe he could rejoin a band.  They need him now.  They need the guy.  Come on.  You've got to get Joel out of fucking prison.  Let's do this.  Oh, what an asshole.  I love those stories, man.  You got any plugs there, Joel, before we hang up on you?  Do I? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Joel's always plugging.  I'm drawing a blank.  Go to notYouTube.com.  All right.  There you go.  Joe, notYouTube.com.  You coming to my Halloween-y party?  Hell yeah.  I'm going to be at you out Saturday for a poker game.  Yeah, we got poker.  What, this Saturday, right?  This coming Saturday.  Yeah, okay.  Cool.  Joe, I follow you on the Twitter there.  So, you go down to Atlantic City a lot to do the poker?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Are you doing it weekly, it seems?  Almost.  Just about.  I walk away in the black every time. 
[02:18:00]  He's really a good poker player, Joe.  It's fucking crazy.  It's crazy.  He was pretty much average for a long time.  You'd play him, and you could win, or, you know, you'd lose.  You know, it was pretty basic.  And then he hit this, like, click up, where all of a sudden he got really fucking good at  playing poker.  You know what it all took?  It took learning how to fold.  No shit, right?  You got to have discipline.  Table discipline.  I was hitting hands.  Man, the last couple of weeks were ridiculous.  I just, hitting hands that I'd never, you know, they're dream hands. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, when you get good hands, it's fucking, makes it a lot easier.  But, you know, you got to know how to play your shitty hands, too, sometimes.  But let me ask you this.  How many hands, percentage of hands you should fold in a basic game of poker?  How many hands should you fold?  I bet it's 90.  I bet it's 90%.  It really depends on how long you're sitting there, because there are guys that do, like,  I did a 16-hour stretch this last...  I'm just talking, like, a basic game, hanging out with your friends, I don't know, six to 
[02:19:00]  eight people at the table.  I'd say, you know what?  Better than half your hands you're folding.  Oh, absolutely, man.  There are some times you're throwing in the middle for ten deals in a row.  That takes ridiculous discipline, because at a point, you just want to play.  So you're like, fuck it, I'll just play the stupid hand.  That's just it.  I know, and that's where you become dumb.  And then you get these people that, yeah, they go in with these shitty hands and fucking  suck out, and you're sitting there going, god damn.  Sometimes pre-flop, you know, if you have a limp pot every, you're finding that, you know, 
[02:19:30]  every hand, you have a table that's just producing a limp pot.  You know, it takes you, of course, you'll get a two-five table, it'll cost you five bucks  to get in.  And you, I mean, I'll go in with anything at that point.  Five bucks.  Of course.  Five table with a couple of grand in front of you.  Yeah.  You go in for five dollars and see what you flop.  And I was winning with six-deuce off suit.  Of course.  If it's just the big blind and it's a cheap fucking blind, of course you're going to see  the plot.  Down in Atlantic City, where you're in the poker room with all those tables, you're folding 
[02:20:00]  well over 75% of your hands, probably?  A lot of hands.  But like I said, it depends on the table.  I was at a table of fish.  I mean, if you're at a table with a bunch of guys that really, you know, that don't  know how to play.  Play anything.  The thing is, you know, if you can't spot the sucker at the table within the first five  minutes, you're probably it.  Yeah.  Wow.  If you see guys at a table, you know, that are playing badly or just, you know, limp pot  every time, no raise pre-flop, you're going to play more than 50% of your hands. 
[02:20:30]  You may fold right after the flop.  You may fold right after the flop, seeing that you caught nothing, and you throw your  five bucks away, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  At least you're playing it, though.  You're in the game.  You're in the game.  Yeah.  Right on.  The flop, at least.  By the way, Eric Bloom is on Twitter, at Eric Bloom, and he's also up on Facebook.  He's my pal on Facebook.  Say hi.  That's pretty cool.  All right, man.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  NotYouTube.com.  NotYouTube.com.  Yeah.  They'll tell you where we're going to be the next few weeks.  Cool, man.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  Later.  Like, this just in.  Ted Kaczynski.  Yeah.  Drummer of Prokelhammer.  Really?  Harem.  Harem.  Oh, Prokelharem.  Fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ted Kaczynski.  Ted Kaczynski.  The Unabomber.  Was actually the drummer.  The original drummer of Prokelharem.  Well, of course, the original drummer.  Original.  You guys say original.  Yeah, because they got replaced.  But then again, you also got to get the name of the band right, too, for the joke to work. 
[02:21:30]  Although, I want to see Prokelhammer now.  They sound pretty fucking, pretty rocking.  Fucking heating up right now.  Iraq, comment.  All confident, I go, Prokelhammer?  What an asshole.  Iraq, that commercial you were talking about, was it a Motorola commercial?  I don't know.  Somebody was writing me that it's one of Kanye West's new songs.  Is it a Kanye?  It's the song that Sam Usher for his open.  Black Skinhead.  That ripoff artist.  If Sam Usher for his open, that's odd, because I never heard a... 
[02:22:00]  Hey, why don't we give a fuck that they got engaged, by the way?  I don't even fucking know about this.  It was like breaking news.  Was it?  It wasn't even just a little side story at the end of a dumb news program.  It was basically breaking news that those two got engaged.  Why the fuck do we give a shit?  I don't know.  And then what do you do with that info?  If you're...  What do you do?  Oh, wow.  What do you do?  Oh, wow.  Are you here?  Did you hear?  Yeah, wow.  Big whoop.  Right.  Big whoop.  Is that it, Sam? 
[02:22:30]  Go to the beginning.  It's not in the beginning.  No?  Well, then it's not it.  Yeah, no, that ain't it.  That's some Gary Glitter shit going on in the background.  No, this is...  Just screams, people.  That's why we don't...  That's a sideways Gary Glitter, though.  It is.  Gay!  They're too scared to use the original, because you know what that means?  That means, you know, you might be into some fucking...  Kid touching.  Some kid touching, so you gotta make a sideways version.  Because we all want to use that song, because it is a great fucking song. 
[02:23:00]  People are asking me on Twitter, hey, Anthony, what's the name of that documentary you were  talking about the other day with the Nambla?  And I just don't answer them, because it's creepy.  No way.  I see these guys, and I'm like, ugh.  It sounds very baiting.  Find it yourself.  It does sound baiting.  Yeah, what's the name of that?  Oh, it's Chicken Hawk.  Oh, and if you like Chicken Hawk, well, let me tell you a few other things you should check  out.  Another film you should...  I'm gonna marry some stuff.  I got some great .org sites.  Want to trade some GIFs? 
[02:23:30]  Can I send you some literature?  Yeah, I have some literature.  Right.  If you want to get a little more into knowledge on Nambla...  Oh, you like Chicken Hawk, too?  Ah.  You might want to go visit my car in long-term parking at the airport.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking Google it yourself, you creeps.  The truck is unlocked.  Someone sent me the link.  I didn't fucking search it out, although I would.  All right, this is where it gets sad for Blue Oyster Cult.  Oh, no.  Go ahead, Jared on Long Island.  Jared.  Hey, I gotta tell you, my kids band, and these guys have got... 
[02:24:00]  I realized that the oldest guy in the band is 22.  Uh-huh.  I mean, they're...  You know, they got together in high school.  They just opened for Blue Oyster Cult three or four months ago.  Where at?  And I have to say, the band, the Blue Oyster Cult was phenomenal.  They played great.  And your son's band, not so much?  Yeah.  You know what?  My kids band, I think, got more accolades than they did.  No, that's not true.  No.  But they were very nice guys. 
[02:24:30]  And I don't know the guy's name, but they have this new guy who plays keyboards and guitar.  He's from Staten Island.  He's phenomenal.  Keeping it in New York, huh?  How about that?  Um, let me...  You're a horrible father, by the way.  How do you not name your son's band?  Right?  Give him a plug.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  Logan's Run.  They're from Cosco, Connecticut.  Clemage, Connecticut.  That sounds familiar, actually.  Logan's Run.  How old's your son?  He's turning 21 next week.  Oh.  And why Logan's Run? 
[02:25:00]  Is someone in the band named Logan?  Was that a club or something?  Why do we know...  I know the movie.  I know that.  But it was a club.  It was something to do with music, too.  It was a club.  No, my son loved the book.  He loved the movie.  What kind of music do they play?  They play original American rock and roll.  They're great.  They throw a little guess who in there to keep people interested.  Everybody's got to go to Logan's Run on Facebook or Logan's Run Music.  All right, we'll check them out.  Look at that plug.  That's pretty big. 
[02:25:30]  Thank you, Jared.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  I'll put Logan's Run.  Really?  We get it already.  You're a proud pop.  All right.  So we got De Blasio.  De Blasio.  Hey, it's Weird Al's birthday and you're not playing Weird Al shit, Eric?  You're the biggest Weird Al fan.  Yeah, you'd start screaming if I came back with a Weird Al song.  Why would I scream?  And why is that bad?  Okay.  Don't you tell me you're full.  Just eat it.  Of course.  Is this your favorite?  No, but it's the one you like.  Why would you play Eat It? 
[02:26:00]  I know.  Of course.  Have some more chicken.  Or I'm fat.  Why?  It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried.  Just eat it.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Eat it.  Just eat it.  Remember how huge this was?  It was ridiculously huge.  This was Weird Al in the 80s was a juggernaut.  MTV charting.  Huge.  When that video came on, you stopped what the fuck you were doing to watch it.  Right.  You got to make a movie.  Yes, he made a dumb movie.  What, VHF or UHF? 
[02:26:30]  UHF.  UHF.  I don't think it holds up.  I liked the movie at the time.  Yeah, I haven't seen it in years.  It's still great.  Yeah.  Are you going to say that because you have blinders on?  No.  It's the guy that goes to the Simpsons village there.  I know.  Yeah, no Weird Al holds up.  At one point, people thought this song was funny.  It doesn't hold up at all.  It was at the time.  It was the greatest thing ever.  Right.  This holds up as like a novelty now, I guess.  Yeah.  Let's talk about the mayor, though.  We're going to have a new mayor here in New York, and I do not like the  choices.  Not that I get that much into politics, but you got de Blasio, and 
[02:27:00]  then you got Lota.  Lota.  Lota.  Yeah, Lota is the Republican.  He's the MTA guy, right?  Yeah, he said that.  He used to work for the MTA, or was the main guy at the MTA.  Yeah.  And de Blasio, who is the Democrat.  He's bringing out his black kids.  He's married to, I guess, a Caribbean woman.  She's Caribbean, and she's very dark-skinned.  Very black.  And he has two black kids.  He used one, his son, in one of his commercials. 
[02:27:30]  It's one of the greatest reveals ever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big afro.  He's my dad.  What?  Yeah.  What?  It's impossible.  And you know he's not allowed to fucking, you know, cut that afro until after the election.  Don't you cut that fucking afro until after I win this.  This shit is making us some money.  De Blasio's got this pretty much wrapped up.  Loda is pretty behind the polls.  He's the Republican.  Right.  Um, and I guess de Blasio was accusing Loda of, uh, racism, of course. 
[02:28:00]  Race baiting.  Race baiting.  With the commercials?  With the commercial about returning New York to the old 70s, 80s version.  I thought you meant the, uh, okay.  The kid thing.  No, it was, uh, it was Loda made a commercial that said if de Blasio gets elected, we're  going to be looking at the New York of the 70s and 80s.  And they showed some pictures.  And they showed some pictures.  Yeah.  I'm with you.  And, uh, de Blasio's like, oh, that's race baiting.  It's like, what?  What are you doing? 
[02:28:30]  Anytime you criticize de Blasio, de Blasio can't pull out this race thing.  But what is de Blasio doing?  Exactly.  Pulling out actual black kids.  He put his black kid on the TV knowing that...  To surprise people, too.  To surprise people and get the minority vote.  The big reveal.  Yeah.  There's some racial shit going on there.  I don't know if it's racism, but it's definitely racial.  And then when...  That's exactly what he's doing with the big reveal.  Yeah.  And he's my dad.  Dad?  Whoa, what? 
[02:29:00]  He's black.  He's black.  Did you see his hat for a hat?  And then there's, um, the, um, the fact that Lota, uh, wants, or likes the stop and frisk.  Mm-hmm.  So de Blasio turns around and says, that's racist.  Like, he just is playing the race card worse than Lota.  Well, Lota isn't even playing it.  He's playing the fucking crime card.  He's playing the reality card.  Yeah.  One thing I was very surprised, both of them were commenting on things with Bloomberg  and said about, uh, the way Times Square is, with the, the roads being closed and the tables 
[02:29:30]  being out there and the pedestrian walks.  Uh, they both are kind of on the fence about it, they said.  Right.  As driver and stuff, regular guys, they're kind of like, well, I like the road when it's  open.  Maybe they can have it part-time, where during rush hour, that's open to traffic, and then  they set it up as a pedestrian mall and off hours.  I know Jimmy hates it.  I think you hate it.  I kind of like it.  I don't mind it now.  I mean, you live, you live in the area.  I'm right there, yeah.  And we're broadcasting in the area.  Every once in a while when you're walking, it's kind of, it's kind of nice. 
[02:30:00]  It's kind of cool.  You get to see some freaks and, you know.  I don't mind it at all.  I like when you're walking and don't have to look, because you're crossing the street.  Right.  And you can just kind of hang.  It's like a hangout area.  Yeah, it's kind of nice.  Anyway, so de Blasio, uh, you know, he, he realizes the Afro kid, you know, is losing  a little heat.  So, he's been hiding his black daughter.  Ah, pulling her out at the end, huh?  Well, you, you haven't even seen this commercial.  Let's just hit it.  No.  Blasio.  From the start of this campaign, Bill de Blasio has offered a vision for New York that 
[02:30:30]  leaves no one behind.  Now that my dad's on the move, his opponents are on the attack.  What?  Dad?  Just remember, who's going to ask the wealthy to pay their fair share to fund the UK  and international programs?  Ah, there you go.  Have fun with that.  Who will end racial profiling to bring together police in the communities they serve?  What?  Who will keep our hospitals from becoming luxury condos?  All of this attention?  It's a good thing.  As long as it's not your little brother.  See?  And they go back to Afro guy.  Afro kid.  It's just two, like, young black people on the screen. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  Pitching for their dad, the white guy that's running for mayor.  But that's like having, like, you got two aces.  Oh, yeah, that is.  I'm going to play the first ace.  Although, you know.  I'm going to hold back the second ace until, like, Afro kid loses a little heat.  And then I'm going to hit him with the fucking hot black daughter of mine.  Well, you can't have two aces of the same suit is a little odd.  But I get what they're doing.  Right.  True.  Is that unbelievable?  Yeah.  That was very.  We get it.  You have a black wife. 
[02:31:30]  We get it.  What color are Lotus kids?  Very white.  I would assume they're white.  They're like, he's racist.  He's not willing to put his.  Oh, yeah.  Racist.  He's not willing to put his penis in a black woman.  He's racist.  That's the commercial I would love to see.  Right.  Unlike.  Unlike.  Myself.  My opponent does not like putting his penis in black women.  Bill de Blasio was willing to have sex with a black woman.  Twice.  Twice.  At least twice.  At least twice.  Right.  Can Lotus say the same thing?  He's a racist. 
[02:32:00]  He's only come in white women.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ah.  Oh, that ominous music.  Why ominous music?  Bill de Blasio likes cumming in black women.  Does Loda?  No.  Ha, ha, ha.  He's racist.  He saves all his cum for the white privileged people, giving none to people of color. 
[02:32:30]  Vote for the man, Bill de Blasio.  He'll fuck black women.  He'll fuck black women.  Ridiculous.  This race is done, by the way.  De Blasio is going to take it.  Yeah, when is it?  This November?  Yep.  All right.  Erection day.  You're pretty affected by this, though.  I know, yeah.  Quite frankly.  I want to get the fuck out of the city badly.  Yeah.  I really do.  I'm trying to figure out what town to move to.  He is really going to, de Blasio is going to just tax the fuck out of people that make 
[02:33:00]  money, give it to all these wacky social programs.  I like the fact that they call it, you know, he's going to stop the stop and frisk so the  relationship between the community and police get better.  It's not going to get better.  No.  Stop it.  No.  This is dumb.  It's this wacky thing, you know, and it's arguable on both parts.  It's arguable that it is your constitutional right to not be illegally searched. 
[02:33:30]  The other side argues that it's not an illegal search.  You're stopping somebody for suspicious activity.  They don't just stop and frisk.  It's, you know, they investigate first, assess the situation, and then stop and frisk.  So that is called an excuse.  Whatever it is, that's debatable.  But the one thing that isn't debatable is the fact that it isn't this thing that if  it stops, the relationship between the police and the black community is going to get better. 
[02:34:00]  That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  Just stop it.  The police are there to arrest criminals.  But all of a sudden the police are going to be like, hey, everybody's going to be all  happy that they're in their neighborhood.  Hey, they're going to wave to the guy in the hoodie with both his hands in his pockets  leering at the police officer from the street corner they know drugs are sold on.  And it's going to be like, yeah, he'll just wave at them.  How you doing?  Yeah, I'm good, motherfucker.  Just look at the slavery thing.  They're still holding a fucking grudge.  Hold a grudge for that one. 
[02:34:30]  Right.  A stop and frisk is going to prevent them from...  That isn't going to do shit.  From people being suspicious when they're in their neighborhoods?  No.  It'll only increase the amount of people that are willing to carry illegal items, contraband  and firearms.  Right.  Because they know that there's no chance of them being stopped and frisked if they are  congregating on a corner where drugs are sold or any other suspicious activity.  See, we have some common ground.  We do.  I believe...  No, me and you, I'm telling you. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  That's where I'm all in with you.  I think you're right.  If you know that the chances of being stopped and frisked is so minimal with this new guy,  you're going to...  If you're one of these people that want to get away with some things, you're like, oh,  fuck.  You like to think of any criminal as a movie criminal where they don't really think about  things.  They don't.  But if you're a guy and you have a couple of strikes against you already and you know  that if you get stopped with drugs on you or a gun on you or something that you are  going away for a long time, you're really going to avoid putting yourself in that situation.  Right.  Knowing now that you can walk the streets and unless you get involved in something, 
[02:35:30]  you can't just be stopped and frisked, you will tend to carry those items that you wouldn't  before because you know you're a lot safer.  It's basic human nature.  You're going to be more willing to pull some shenanigans.  Shenanigans.  Might I even say hijinks.  And some hijinks.  And perhaps some mayhem.  Really?  Yes, a little mayhem.  And I got breaking news.  What?  Wow, look at line one.  Wow.  Did you know this was going on? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, brother.  Let me see.  Matt, what's going on, buddy?  How are you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  You got something for the radio show?  I do.  I do.  Speaking of mayors, I know you're a favorite mayor up there in Boston.  I was reading on ESPN last night and he was talking about the Red Sox winning the World  Series and he said he hopes they win the World Series Cup.  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  Is there audio of this?  I don't know if they got audio.  I read it in the...  Who's fucking...  Holy shit. 
[02:36:30]  Travis or Sam.  Why the fuck?  Right.  Didn't you guys have this audio for us this morning?  I got to tell you, we've been on the radio three hours and this is the first we're hearing  of this.  Yeah, he said the World Series Cup.  He actually said the World Series Cup.  Did that just happen this morning?  No, yesterday.  What?  Why didn't I get a tweet about it?  I don't know.  I read that last night on ESPN.  Someone should have tweeted me a link or something, fuckers.  I can't believe we don't...  Now we look stupid.  We haven't talked about it. 
[02:37:00]  It's a big thing.  We look at it like we're out of touch or something because we all, you know, we love when the  mayor fucks up up there in Boston.  Sabian better get in Sam's and Travis's ass about not having this sound for us.  What, Matt?  I figured I missed it earlier this morning and you guys may have already talked about  it, but...  No, no, we didn't.  Oh, man.  No.  So, that's the last...  How much longer are we going to do this?  All right, man.  How much longer are we going to fake the...  All right, thanks. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, Wall from Michigan says it's Candlelight Commerce.  Oh, the Godzilla song.  It's still bugging me.  Oh.  Sorry.  All right.  Tell us them out.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Matt.  The never die Red Sox will play in the third World Series the last nine years.  Last.  Well, I'm going to be rooting hard to bring back the World Series Cup to Boston like we  did in 2004 and 2007.  What's this cup?  Ho-de-hi-ho.  Ho-de-hi-de-hi.  Ho-de-hi-de-ho. 
[02:38:00]  Ho-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi.  Ho-de-ho-de-ho.  Ho-de-ho.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, thank you, sir, but we did kind of get to that a little earlier.  Oh, we got the Lota clip from the debate.  Lota.  With Bill de Blasio.  Blasio.  What an awful name that is.  De Blasio.  And Lota.  Bleh.  Let's know why.  My entire career, I've done nothing but work with people and bring them together.  Your ad doesn't look like something that's trying to bring people together, Mr. Lota. 
[02:38:30]  It's trying to tell people what would happen to you and how dangerously reckless you are.  It's race-fading and fear-mongering.  It is not.  No, no, let's stop.  You know it.  There is nothing race-fading about it.  There is nothing race-fading about it.  You want to throw out the race card?  I just said it.  Let's talk about the various different mask cards that are put out for the thousands of  people that are killed in this city.  Let's talk about the report cards for the kids who are being kept in failing schools.  Let's talk about the scorecard that says New York City is the highest taxed city in the 
[02:39:00]  country.  Damn.  Don't tell me I threw out the race card because there is nothing racial in there.  And Bill, you cannot stoop out low to bring that up.  Mr. Lota can be as upset as he wants to be.  I'm not upset.  The bottom line is, the bottom line is, his ad depicted images of riots.  God, they're all just fucking assholes.  Just call him an end lover.  That's what I would do.  What was de Blasio doing with the black kids?  Exactly.  Using it, knowing that it would have a racial effect on the election. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because minorities, for the most part, don't want to fucking vote for white people.  The white guy.  So if you're a white guy, but you're like, holy fuck, I got black kids.  Okay, we know what we got to do here.  We got to get the black kids on TV.  What is he talking about?  Oh, he's going home.  He's hearing some shit from the community.  Right.  No, he's got a little liaison.  He's got two liaisons from the community right there in his own home.  He completely took advantage of the fact that he has black kids.  Yes. 
[02:40:00]  Period.  Mm-hmm.  Period.  Especially with the big reveal, like we said.  It was literally the first commercial I saw for de Blasio was the one with his son.  And if he wasn't taking advantage of it, he would have just had the Afro kid right away go,  hey, de Blasio's my father.  This is why I think he should be the next mayor.  But no, they waited to the end so you had that what the fuck moment.  Yeah, he should have said, started the commercial, my father, Bill de Blasio, is running for mayor.  If he wasn't making it racial.  Because then the commercial hits out there and then all the people start talking like, 
[02:40:30]  yeah, this fucking motherfuckers got black kids.  You see that shit?  We had black kids.  Oh, they're all just full of shit.  Black people should vote for him.  And Loda was so upset when they started laughing.  Yeah.  When he said, I'm not upset.  I'm not upset.  And everybody started laughing.  He flashed this look to the audience.  Like, come on, guys.  What are you doing?  Get with me.  Why are you laughing at me, guys?  Why are you behind me here?  You have to look to both of them, whatever.  There was a great fucking, oh, great story on, and I can't stand the gawker.  They're liberal fucking cocksuckers over there. 
[02:41:00]  I can't stand them.  But I got to laugh at the Shepard Smith story they had yesterday about apparently some waitress.  There was some waitress at a bar on 9th Avenue who was saying that Shep was getting a little rambunctious with her  because she wasn't coming fast enough with his drinks.  Uh-oh.  He had ordered another round of drinks for him and his party that was gathered there.  And not fast enough. 
[02:41:30]  So he said, he went up to her and he was like, bring me my fucking drink.  While she was taking the order of somebody else.  She was taking the order for someone else.  He goes, no, I asked you already.  Now bring me my fucking drink.  He said fucking drink?  Yeah.  So she had described how he comes in there a lot.  And this time he had come in with a couple, another friend who was a couple,  who the woman pointed out was a heterosexual couple,  and him with who she identified as his big boyfriend, his big muscular boyfriend. 
[02:42:00]  The waitress said all this?  Yeah, the waitress was saying how she has seen them in the bar sitting there holding hands,  with their hand in each other's laps, I guess.  And just drinking various beverages.  But he was getting a little upset with that hold.  They made the story like how he got upset about the drink and then just, as an aside,  throwing the fact that it's a gap.  They just blew up his spot.  Yeah, they just blew up his spot.  He rocked.  It also said that he refuses to order anything off the menu. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  His stuff always has to be specialty made, so it takes a little while.  Custom-made special drinks.  Oh.  He likes.  But he had a very muscular boyfriend, as it was described by the waitress.  This waitress said that they had then, he said, forget it, got up, him and his party left without leaving a tip.  And that's what's going to be a gawker.  Yeah.  All right.  They dance around it without actually accusing him. 
[02:43:00]  It says Smith had arrived earlier that night with a straight couple and his own regular date, a muscular 6'2", 30-something white male,  whom Bathtub Gin employees refer to as, quote, his boyfriend.  Right.  That's the name of the place, Bathtub Gin, on 9th Ave.  What the fuck is that?  I don't know.  Do you know, Ope?  No.  Do you know where that bar is?  Do you know, Sam?  I don't.  Oh.  I know who would know.  Sale. 
[02:43:30]  You think so?  Probably.  He would definitely be aware.  I bet Sale would know.  And he probably knows the specialty drink that the bar's known for.  Oh, yeah.  Come.  Definitely.  That, but I've heard things, you know, I do a couple of shows over there at Fox News, and I've heard.  Yeah?  You know, there's some chatter in the hallways, and the green rooms, and the dressing and makeup room.  Just a couple of things have been said over time that would lead you to believe that, Shep, that this story might be true. 
[02:44:00]  Whoa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So when he did that story.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  He wasn't thinking about Jennifer Lopez giving him a blowjob at all.  Oh, remember that when he said that one?  Do we have that?  J-Lo.  Yeah.  Jenny from the block.  Jenny from the block.  Shep has had a few fuck-ups.  J-Lo's new song, Jenny from the block, all about Lopez roots, about how she's still a neighborhood gal at heart.  But folks from that street in New York, the Bronx section, sound more likely to give her a curb job than a blowjob. 
[02:44:30]  Or a block party in the New York Post.  Sorry about that slip up there.  I have no idea how that happened.  But it won't happen again.  And that's your news.  That's great.  A blowjob.  Boy, that wasn't even, like, slightly.  No.  He didn't catch it at the end.  He didn't.  And that's, he had a blowjob on his mind right there.  And there was a block party he was trying to say.  Block party turns into a blowjob. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  Should we do some Jacktober after the break?  I really would like to get to Jacktober at some juncture.  Well, we're running out of show.  I know.  We should, though.  All right.  We'll try to do it next.  Not to mention the potential for flooding here in New Orleans.  Because New Orleans, you know, impossible to forget, is a city that's in a bowl and below sea level.  The pumps are working well now.  But Mayor Nagar, Mayor Nagin warns, don't come home.  All right, Judge.  All right.  Hello, this is Weird Al Yankovic. 
[02:45:30]  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony!  Thanks, Weird Al.  Thanks.  Happy birthday.  54 years old today.  Who?  Weird Al Yankovic.  Oh, Weird Al.  I was just discussing Billy Crystal with my pal, Anthony Comia.  Billy Crystal.  And, you know, I got to watch a lot of kids' movies these days. 
[02:46:00]  And fucking the original Monsters movie, Monster Inc. was on.  Monsters Inc.  I fucking hate him.  I hate Billy Crystal.  And it got me to thinking, have I ever liked Billy Crystal?  Have I ever liked him in a movie?  And then you realize he's been in some really good movies, but I didn't like him in those very good movies either.  Although I enjoyed the movie.  Huh.  If that makes sense.  It makes sense.  Like the City Slicker thing?  City Slickers and Curly's Gold?  Well, slow down.  The triumphant sequel? 
[02:46:30]  Slow down.  Hmm.  You know, Jack Palance or whatever the fuck.  Jack Palance.  He was great in City Slickers, right?  But was Billy Crystal great in City Slickers?  I don't even know.  He was Billy Crystal.  He's the stupid green eyeball-y thing in Monsters, Inc.  And I'm just like, oh, God, I have to listen to his fucking voice.  That annoying voice.  Fair enough, you've got to watch some of these kid movies and stuff.  Yeah.  Then you've got to just be annoyed because Billy Crystal's in it?  He's riding his horse, but he's got, what, a Yankee hat on? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, that's crazy.  What kind of hat?  Once.  Isn't it the Mets?  Mets hat.  With a Mets hat?  He's a big Mets fan, right.  Mets hat.  Long Island guy.  Texas.  He's a City Slicker.  Ask him.  Look at this little dirt.  Nothing says City Slicker like a baseball cap.  Ah, you know what?  Look at him.  Jesus.  He's just a regular guy.  What's he doing on horseback?  I can't even watch this.  What clip is this?  Jack Palance.  Believe it or not.  I got embarrassed last night speaking of kids' programs. 
[02:47:30]  Travis, of all people, wrote me.  He wrote, you watching this John Spano Islanders 30 for 30 thing.  Remember John Spano trying to buy the Islanders, or he did for a little bit until they realized  the guy had no fucking money.  Oh, right.  You want to talk about a tool. 
[02:48:00]  John Spano was a tool.  It's the whole Islanders story.  30 for 30 with, what's his name, did it?  Kevin Connolly.  Kevin Connolly.  It was really good.  And you're not a sports guy.  No, and I loved it.  So, and Travis knows I'm a big hockey slash Islanders fan, so he writes, you watching this  John Spano Islanders 30 for 30.  I actually had to write back, sadly, no.  I hear it's great, but I'm watching Chipmunks meets Frankenstein.  Oh, boy.  You are, huh?  Alvin and the Chipmunks meet Frankenstein. 
[02:48:30]  That voice.  The voices of those Chipmunks.  That's pretty funny.  And, you know, a lot of times I certainly can leave my kid alone now.  He's over three.  Oh, man.  But he didn't want...  Get a job.  He didn't want me to leave in the room because he was scared.  So, when he's scared, then I have to fucking hang in there.  Scared of the Chipmunks and Frankenstein?  He was scared of Frankenstein.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Is this, like, animated Chipmunks and live action?  Yeah, it's old school.  CGI, it's old school?  It's a really old school cartoon.  Oh, so it's the cartoon. 
[02:49:00]  I'm surprised you didn't know this.  No, I wasn't a big Chipmunk fan.  Alvin and the Chipmunks meets Frankenstein.  There it is.  Boy, you could meets Frankenstein anything back then.  Yeah.  You just throw Frankenstein in your title.  That's it.  Alvin Costello did it.  Guaranteed hit, right?  Fucking yeah.  So then Travis...  Oh, man, this is old.  I didn't even ask Travis.  He writes back, well, at least you're missing it for something good.  I think that's a slam.  I think it is.  I think that's a slight slam right there.  I don't think he really meant that that was a good movie. 
[02:49:30]  No.  No.  I was so pumped.  Damn.  And the Alleners are on as well.  I'm down one TV is what it comes down to.  What?  The one that he threw something at?  No, I fixed that one.  Oh.  I know the TV's fucking shot.  I don't know why I got it.  Oh, man.  Yeah, Joe, if you're listening, give me a fucking call, please.  Jeepers.  Give me another TV, you son of a bitch.  That sucks.  The things John Spano was doing when he was trying to get out of paying for the team because  he didn't have any money.  Right.  He owed them...  At one point, he owed the team $17 million.  Yeah.  He wire-transferred $1,700 to the team. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  See that?  And then they said, hey, it's $1,700.  That's outrageous!  Why would it only be $1,700?  Oh, man.  There were people on there telling stories like investors would...  come into town and go to lunch with them, and they'd bring the bill to the table, and  everybody would just stare at the bill because John Spano didn't have the money to pay for  lunch.  He was like fucking Jerry Lundegaard with the guy from...  Yeah, come on.  This is from GMAC, where we need those numbers. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'll send them right over to you.  I highly recommend you check out the John Spano story.  Yeah.  I forgot the title of it's even hilarious.  It's called...  Oh, fuck.  Who knows the real...  Oh, fuck, people.  Go see that.  Big shot.  Yeah, big shot.  Oh, big shot.  Big shot.  It's funny.  And they got him.  They interviewed him.  Yeah.  He'll talk.  I mean...  He'll probably come on our show.  I gotta watch the thing first, and then...  He went to jail.  What's he thinking?  Like, did he say anything as to why he did this? 
[02:51:00]  And...  Yeah, he wanted...  He wanted to be the owner of the Islanders.  Well, yeah.  Who doesn't?  Maybe want to own a sports team.  Well, a lot of us want to, and he said, fuck it.  Why have money stand in the way?  Oh.  And he figured out how he could kind of do it.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  He's like a pathological liar, and he hung out with, like, big shots and business people  in Texas.  That is great.  But no one did their, you know...  DD, yeah.  The background check.  Well, because the Islanders were in such trouble.  In 96, when he came on, that they wanted to believe that this Texas billionaire... 
[02:51:30]  Here comes a savior.  A savior.  Yeah.  Oh, and he's just broke.  A white knight to save the team.  Broke is a joke.  That's great.  So, I gotta watch it.  I'm gonna watch it today on DVR.  That shit.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  You just did a Mike Francesco.  I did a Mike Francesco with my water, but it was very little bit.  A little...  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  That's very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions. 
[02:52:00]  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-T.  Host.  Holes.  Bits.  And stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  Oh, Johnny on the spot here with a couple of napkins.  Thank you.  What is this one napkin at a time shit? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, let's do it.  Yeah, you just do that.  There you go, son.  Thank you.  Billy Crystal.  Everything's like a voice.  It's like...  I'm still on it.  I'm sorry.  Wacky voice.  He's vaudeville-y.  You know what I mean?  Yes.  Yes.  He's very vaudeville-y.  His...  The Borscht belt.  His black jazz guy that plays the trumpet is the best character, though.  Yeah, I know.  It's my favorite.  Anyway, let's do some Jocktober.  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  I know Jimmy's a fan of Billy Crystal, so if Jimmy was here, he would be defending Billy 
[02:53:00]  Crystal.  I know he'd be as silent as he is right now.  He's everything Todd Pettengill wishes he was.  Oh, God, right?  Yes.  Parental Guidance with Billy Crystal and Bette Midler is the worst movie ever made.  I'm not exaggerating.  The worst. 
[02:53:30]  That's from Steve from Philly.  He's a good dude on Twitter.  Yeah.  I think we played the trailer.  Yeah, we did.  It was terrible.  I'm going to rent that today.  Let's all do that.  A little homework?  Is it on our cable system?  Is it on demand yet?  I guess I can Netflix that shit.  And let's all watch Parental Guidance with Billy Crystal and Bette Midler.  I follow Bette on Twitter.  She is one of those liberal dick fucking bags.  Oh, what?  I follow it just to annoy me.  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  And it works.  I'll tell you one thing.  What, too?  We'd love to.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That fucking...  No, no, no, no, no.  Can't do it, huh?  No.  I fucking hate him.  He thinks he...  That Marissa Tomei still looks good.  Oh, my God.  Gotta give it to her.  You'd pop her in the shitter, right?  Oh, man.  I would.  But I hear she's into bald, stocky men, apparently.  Like who?  George Costanza.  Fuck.  You know who was up here yesterday still looking good? 
[02:54:30]  Oh.  Alyssa Milano.  Yeah, she does still look good.  She's not even that old, though.  She's 40.  Oh, she's 40 now, huh?  Yeah, the little girl from fucking Who's the Boss is 40, huh?  She looks fantastic.  That happened.  You know what she was fucking...  Looked so hot in Commando.  That's so long ago.  She was like 12, I think.  The beginning of Commando could be one of the greatest scenes ever in a movie, where Arnold  is playing with Alyssa Milano in the pool and everything, and he's laughing. 
[02:55:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, theburst...  The ice cream or whipped cream on the nose...  Ah!  Ah!  Ha!  Ah!  Ah!  He's just laughing too hard!  I love it!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah ha!  I love it!  Yeah!  What is it?  His acting's over the top?  Ah!  It's so bad!  Ah!  Play with my daughter!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:55:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  You could find the opener.  It's like over the opening credits, I think.  Really?  No quit swimming.  Those big gappy teeth.  I kind of don't want to find it because there's no way it's as funny as when you're making it out to me.  There's no way. 
[02:56:00]  That movie kicks ass, though, man.  I love the old Arnold movies.  Hey, we got a guy whose daughter's hooked on parental guidance.  Frank in New York City.  Your daughter's four, and she loves parental guidance.  Oh, my God, boy.  It's fucking awful.  All day she wants to watch that.  I guess it's because it's with the kids.  He's got grandkids in the movie.  And my daughter's at that age now where she likes real people in real movies.  But this fucking movie is awful.  There's this scene where he takes his grandson to the bathroom. 
[02:56:30]  He takes his grandson to the bathroom.  Okay, because your phone dropped out.  Go ahead.  And he sings a duty song.  It's fucking stupid.  A duty song?  Did you find the Billy Crystal duty song from parental guidance?  Now I got to hear that.  I think I'm going to have the commando thing.  Thank you, Frank.  We're going to go commando first, and then we're going to get the duty song by Billy Crystal from parental guidance.  Watch it out, boy.  All right, this is what Ant's talking about with commando. 
[02:57:00]  And this is Milano.  All right, he's bringing a big log down.  He's chopping some wood.  He's just being Arnold.  Oh, he sees his daughter.  Seems like a tough guy.  Oh, he is.  Cold heart.  He's fucking jacked.  Uh-oh.  Someone's creeping up behind him.  Better chop him up with an axe.  It's only showing the shadow.  He's got the axe. 
[02:57:30]  He's looking in the reflection.  Uh-oh.  Might have to eliminate this.  Oh, it's...  Oh, it's Spanish.  Oh, Jesus.  No, because you're not even getting the real fucking audio.  Look at the ice cream on the nose.  Yeah, I'm with some ice cream.  And now I give you...  I put it on your nose.  Are you crazy? 
[02:58:00]  Ah, the tough guy has a soft heart.  He's teaching her karate.  Yeah.  Ha.  I guess the Spaniards like this movie, huh?  Yeah.  A lot of Spanish versions of the Commando.  Are we feeding a deer?  Look, if the deer has something to eat, she did it.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:58:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I fucking love that!  That's really fucking love!  Ah!  I gotta watch that when I get home.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Billy Crystal, ah, what is it?  Ah!  Ah!  You sing some duty song?  Duty song?  And parental guidance?  I gotta hear this fucking thing.  Anyone have a link to this shit?  I think I do.  Here it is.  Oh yeah!  Here we go!  Come out, Mr. Duty!  He has to bring his grandson into the toilet for the first time.  Oh, sure.  Oh, I gotta go number two.  Daddy always sings to me.  Come out, come out, Mr. Doody. 
[02:59:00]  And swim in the swimming pool.  I know it's not where you're hiding.  Ew.  But out here it's really cool.  Yeah.  That's all you need to know about Billy Crystal.  Why don't you let a kid take a shit on your lap?  Dude, he was Billy Crystal sitting on the toilet.  Sitting on the toilet like he would be taking a shit.  With the grandson on his lap.  Right.  Straining to take a shit. 
[02:59:30]  Which means, you know, he's bare-bottomed.  Whoever would let a kid take a shit like that?  You know what makes this hilarious?  Is all the people that are in the Port Authority-type bathroom.  Right, they heard that.  In a horrible bathroom.  And they're all looking toward the stall like,  What's that?  We got a fucking creep in the stall.  I am sitting on my lap, taking a shit.  I am taking a dump on my lap.  He's got ice cream too, doesn't he?  Oh yeah, ice cream's on his nose.  He's fucking feeding a deer. 
[03:00:00]  Jack-tober time.  Jack-tober timey.  Yeah.  It's bit day.  Yeah, it's a special today.  We have, uh...  It's called bit day.  We have some from Prep Burger, and then there's a few bits.  Oh, nice.  That I didn't feel like we needed to attack the entire show.  Right.  But just I wanted to pull some bits out of different shows.  Nice, okay.  Very cool.  So we're getting a little smorgasbord.  That's right.  So the first one is definitely Prep Burger.  And of course, not only do they give you the material, 
[03:00:30]  they also give you the setup.  Ah.  So you, as the radio host, don't have to do fucking nothing.  I like it.  Just have to be a good reader.  Yeah.  Set that shit up.  President Obama made a speech in the Rose Garden yesterday, Anthony,  about the sorrystateofthehealthcare.gov website.  Everyone's talking about it.  Oh yeah, Opie, they sure are.  I added a little there, too.  I did, yeah.  We both added a little.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We went off script a little bit.  There's no reason for that.  We went off script just a little bit. 
[03:01:00]  We shouldn't have lived, though.  The Prep Burger knows what they're doing.  Just to pump it up a little bit.  It's like, you know, would you take a teaspoon of sugar  and put it in your Coke?  No, you don't mess with the formula.  No.  He made a few more comments at the press conference this morning,  and guess what?  We have them.  We do.  We have the audio.  Look, I know the Obamacare website is a train wreck.  I mean, I'm beginning to think whoever designed it had to be a Republican.  But I have the best of the best working on the website to get it fixed.  That includes Microsoft's Bill Gates. 
[03:01:30]  You may recall Microsoft recently put out Windows 8,  and you know how well that went.  I've also recruited Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg,  mainly so you can play Bubble Witch Saga  while you're waiting for the website to download.  And waiting, and waiting.  But we'll get that website up and running faster  than you can say crash and burn.  No more questions.  What is Obama going to be?  That's funny.  No, that was the Obama audio.  Oh, I thought it was the guy before Obama or something. 
[03:02:00]  No, that was the Barack Obama?  Yeah, did that not sound like it?  I thought it was someone else.  No.  Maybe the worst Obama impression ever recorded.  Just because you could do maybe one or two words as Obama  doesn't mean you could do an Obama impression.  Everything has to go up.  Right.  And you sound like Obama.  That's all the guy's doing.  That's all he's doing.  Imagine being a radio show that relies on Prep Burger for bits,  and then you download that in the morning going,  oh no, this is all I have. 
[03:02:30]  That's all we have.  But a boy could dream.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would love to do some Prep Burger.  Oh, would that be nice?  Not having to even worry about anything?  How great would that be?  Oh, man.  Just come in and download.  You get your setups.  You go to the hits.  Not have to fucking, not have to burn my throat out going,  look, ice cream is on my nose.  He's having a good time.  Oh, he loved it.  With his daughter.  But I'm also a killer. 
[03:03:00]  Look, I killed you.  We didn't even know we were going to do that.  Or the Billy Crystal Duty song.  Who knows?  So face to the rest of radio.  For you.  Well, you know, there's been rumors, Ant, that Gwyneth Paltrow,  Paltrow there, Gwyneth Paltrow.  Gwyneth Pacho.  Cheated on her husband.  You know, the Coldplay dude.  The Coldplay guy?  Yeah, I just called him the Coldplay dude.  Damn.  They say Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.  Chris Martin.  Right?  Well, you know, we caught up with Gwyneth and Chris to talk about it. 
[03:03:30]  Oh.  Yeah, we did.  Hey, Gwyneth.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Hey, Chris.  Chris Martin from Coldplay.  I've been hearing a rumor that Gwyneth had an affair.  Is that true?  Yes, it's true.  Chris is aware of it, and it was all a big misunderstanding.  I thought he was Chris.  Whoa.  Who did you cheat on him with?  It was a chicken.  Huh?  But it was an easy mistake to make.  Have you ever heard my husband sing?  Go ahead, Chris.  Sing something.  Very well.  See what I mean? 
[03:04:00]  Why is that singing chicken shaped like a human?  Holy fuck.  Wow.  This is not fun.  If Jim was here.  This is going great.  I have to stand in for Jim.  Yeah.  Fucking hilarious.  Well, it's realistic.  I don't understand the concept there.  Wow.  What was that?  Chris Martin sounds like a chicken, I guess. 
[03:04:30]  That's right.  But no one has ever thought that.  No, no one's ever.  There's not one person that has ever thought that.  Chris Martin, they're commies based on nonsense.  He's actually told that he's a very good singer.  He's an amazing singer.  Whether you like Coldplay or not, the guy knows how to fucking sing.  They apparently thought he sounded like a chicken.  And who would go up to him and say,  Hey, excuse me, Chris Martin from Coldplay.  Somebody that wanted to get his attention.  Get to the bottom of the chicken thing.  Like a TMZ guy or something.  Get to the bottom of the chicken thing. 
[03:05:00]  Yes, the chicken thing.  Hot on everybody's mind.  Wow, this is bad.  Really bad.  Hey, if you want 24 to 48 hours of attention like the St. Louis Rams has had,  just mention that you might be trying to hire Tim Tebow and voila.  You didn't play the...  What did I do next?  What?  You're supposed to read that as if it was you saying it.  And then what happens?  Then you play the bit.  What bit?  There's a bit along with it?  Yeah, there's a bit along with it.  I thought Obie was just talking.  It was very natural.  Oh, thanks, Ed. 
[03:05:30]  I appreciate it.  It's just a setup, though.  Yeah.  Tired of wasted advertising dollars on social media and conventional marketing?  What you need is Tim Tebow, the proven name to drop to make your business pop.  Just grab a headline-chasing reporter, which is all of them, tell them you're thinking of  hiring Tim Tebow, and watch your name appear all over the news.  Stop struggling today and christen your next promotion with Tim Tebow.  In the world of media attention, he's the cherry.  On top.  Ready to be popped? 
[03:06:00]  What did that mean?  I don't even know what that means.  I didn't get that one at all.  Gay reference?  You think so?  I don't know.  Was it getting a little edgy there?  Because I tapped out.  I might have.  Was there a little edge there?  I don't know.  I was tapping myself.  Do you understand why we hate all of radio?  Oh, God.  People pay for these, by the way.  This is Prep Burger.  People pay.  They do well.  They have a lot of radio stations that are signed up for their service, and these radio 
[03:06:30]  stations are playing these bits.  Yeah.  Oh, and I was looking at the calendar.  It's National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  Oh, Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  What?  National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  Why do you have to be aware of this?  It's either National Massage Therapy Week.  It's either you ache or you don't.  Give the fuck.  You don't need awareness.  Like, I'm aware of it.  But this is the bit you should do.  Right.  We're kind of doing it on the fly, but you don't, like, do it as a real thing. 
[03:07:00]  You say how ridiculous it is to have National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  Is there anyone that doesn't know that there is massage therapy?  Well, awareness is supposed to mean, like, look, let's bring this problem to light.  Right.  Let's bring this cause to the forefront.  Yes, look, most people don't know this even exists.  Let's educate people.  You can't go a block in New York City without seeing the word massage.  Yes.  Some people don't know.  They just walk around with very tense shoulders. 
[03:07:30]  Yes.  They don't know what to do.  And there's a cure for that.  Thus then, National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  And guess what?  They have a spokesman.  Oh, do they?  Yep.  Do we have audio of him?  Nope.  Oh, okay.  Nope.  None at all.  All right.  No, we don't.  Oh, well, that kind of brings it to a screeching halt, doesn't it?  That petered out.  Well, I sure wish we had audio.  That would be nice.  It's too bad. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  What?  This week is massage now.  Come on.  Come on.  Hold on.  Just an excuse to use their mediocre John Travolta impression.  I swear I thought that was Bill Clinton.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I thought he was doing a Bill Clinton.  Well, I knew the answer.  I should have went into this one cold.  It's a mediocre John Travolta.  This is what happens.  That's John Travolta?  This is what happens at the prep burger factory.  Yeah.  There's a guy.  What voices do you do?  A guy goes, hey, do John Travolta. 
[03:08:30]  And he does it.  It's like average, mediocre at best.  So then they have to shoehorn it into some weird thing.  Yeah, yeah.  So then they look at the calendar and there's actually...  I doubt there's even a National Massage Therapy Awareness Week, but they're like, oh, shit.  You do John Travolta.  Yeah.  And it's this National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  You happy?  You happy now, Annette?  Now you're a cunt.  I'm John Travolta.  Guy in California, David, says local radio station has played two of these bits just yesterday. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, God.  Why is this fucking...  Why the fuck are you listening to them, Dave?  Don't mess with my hair.  I take a long time to wear it on my hair.  And you mess with it.  You touch my hair.  Why do you listen to them if they're playing these horrible prep burger bits?  I feel like it's the same reason why Annette follows Bette Midler on Twitter.  Just to annoy me.  Just to be annoyed.  Fair enough.  All right.  Let's get to John Travolta.  All right.  What? 
[03:09:30]  This week is Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  Did you know that regular massage therapy is beneficial?  To live a healthy, active lifestyle?  It is.  Yeah.  It does wonders to relieve stress that would otherwise make you feel blue.  And as always, with every ending, don't forget the tip.  Seriously.  Don't forget the tip.  We get it.  Tip of your dick.  You do great work.  You know that?  I might have to put you on my staff.  Just like last time.  Okay, Senor Travolta. 
[03:10:00]  I hope I can hold the weight.  Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  It's explosive.  What?  Oh, my God.  I need a towel.  Say what a few more times so they know you're doing Travolta.  Right.  Yeah.  John Travolta Clinton.  Right.  Get down from there.  And there are dozens of radio stations across the country.  They just play them every morning.  You didn't call me, Mr. President.  You didn't call me.  Oh, come down from there. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, man.  I was just thinking.  You're so bad.  I like where you're going, O.  Yeah.  Was this morning's drive a bummer?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, I gotta say.  You know.  Traffic.  Yep.  Now what?  I gotta convey my story about the Midtown Tunnel?  Do I do that?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No?  What do we do? 
[03:11:00]  Oh.  You play the bit.  What bit?  We just had a little thing there.  I asked him how the morning thing was.  I was like, the Midtown Tunnel guy stopped me again today.  Not everything has to be an over-the-top 20-minute bit.  I was just asking him a question.  He said, yeah, it was a bummer today.  All right, now what?  Looked at my Reggie and said, have a good day, all snotty.  And I said, oh, thank you, sir, all snotty, and went on my way.  There you go.  We did it.  Is that it?  No, we have some audio.  But Opie was setting me up.  Why does everything have to have audio?  Why can't we just talk?  You're in there.  Do they have microphones in their studios to talk into? 
[03:11:30]  Why can't they just go, hey, how was your ride in today?  And then they have a little discussion about it.  And then people out there go, oh, I can relate to that.  Ah, right.  Oh, you know, I take that road, too.  There's too much.  And you know, I was in that same backup today.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I love going to work with these guys.  They're just like me.  They're relatable.  Right.  Maybe I'll see them on the road.  Right.  Let me look around.  He's out here at the same time I am.  Yeah.  He stops at the same Dunkin' Doris I do.  He was just talking about it.  Why can't they just do that? 
[03:12:00]  Because sometimes you also, you've got to have a laugh.  And when there's this much gold out there for a radio show to use, it'd be a crime not to.  I think it's too risky, too, to just talk on the mic.  You might say something bad or offensive or it might not be funny.  Realize you're a no-talent.  Yeah, that, too.  Do they grow flowers with these things?  How about you use the mic in front of you?  Use that mic.  They'd rather hit a button and know for sure every word that's going to come out of that speaker.  Yeah, they don't want to wear them out.  Yeah.  Was this morning's drive a bummer? 
[03:12:30]  Oh, no.  It wasn't my fault.  Some guy in a Plymouth totally cut me off.  It was the worst commuting.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Come on, man.  Seriously.  Commuting.  I'm commuting.  Commuting.  You know what a shoehorn is?  Because some people ask, what is shoehorning?  You take the word exactly as it's phrased in the song.  Right.  And say it that way in a conversation.  Would people look at you like you're weird because you're mispronouncing a word? 
[03:13:00]  That's a shoehorn.  Oh, no.  It wasn't my fault.  Some guy in a Plymouth totally cut me off.  It was the worst commuting.  Right there at rush hour time.  Traffic backed up miles ahead.  It was a bummer on the morning drive.  Just like every day before.  There's nothing going on forever.  Oh.  Traffic made me late again. 
[03:13:30]  And I show up at work when they're home.  I made my thoughts get so uptight.  He was so mad he even drooled a little bit.  That's like super mad.  It was a bummer on the morning drive.  He is a madman.  So slow.  So slow.  Now look, you'll get out of my way.  It was a bummer on the morning drive.  This has all the features.  That's why it drives me nuts.  Oh, yeah.  Get out of my way.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box.  That's inhumane. 
[03:14:00]  Well, it sucks.  I'm breaking your balls and you're getting fucking fished.  They had a few clips in there that were a little, should have bleeped maybe.  That was weird, that last one especially.  It's so bad.  That's the wacky morning drive traffic song parody with the clips.  You know, the Simpsons clip is in there.  It just fills up space.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just there.  Who's laughing at that?  Wow. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, thank God they're playing this.  Horrible.  Well, now we move on to some bonuses.  That's it for Prep Burger today.  That's good stuff.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  That's good stuff.  That's good stuff.  We go to London, Ontario, Canada.  What?  103.1 Fresh FM.  We're not doing their show.  Fresh.  We just got a couple of their horrendous bits.  Yeah.  Horrendous.  Here's the first one.  Ryan, my dog says, woof to you too. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  Let's see what Stanley's saying today.  Late October.  It's a time when the trees change color and doggy walks get much colder.  It's the perfect time to break out my knitted doggy sweater.  Other doggy parents may laugh at me, but it keeps me warm.  I'm not as big as my other doggy companions.  Also, the lady dogs love my sweater. 
[03:15:30]  They say it makes me look more sophisticated.  If you have a small doggy, get them a winter jacket or sweater.  It will make the winter time much more comfortable and enjoyable.  My name is Stanley.  See you at the dog park.  Come on, Stanley.  Let's go.  Oh, it is doody doogie.  I asked my dog where he put my frisbee and all he said was woof.  It was on the roof.  On 103.1 Fresh FM.  I don't even know what that was.  I, I, I, I. 
[03:16:00]  I don't know what that was.  What, what?  Holy shit.  I felt like I was listening to four different bits at one time.  Yeah.  It's woof, my dog says.  It's a doggy translator.  It's like Siri.  Right.  Like if a dog barked into Siri and then the human English came out.  Well, maybe they should set it up better.  That's not going to help the bit, but maybe we should set it up better.  And, and you know what else though?  Maybe they should just call it Siri for dogs or something.  Like, I don't even know what that was.  That was also a little public service announcement. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  For dogs.  They were helping there with that one.  Telling you people, hey, you got a little dog, put a little sweater on him out there in the winter.  A little fella's cold.  Oh.  It's interesting that you bring up public service announcements.  Oh.  Well, one 3.1 Fresh FM in London, Ontario, Canada.  A little more enthusiasm.  Oh, good fun.  Uh, here's your public Ryan announcement.  Oh.  Public Ryan announcement.  There's a guy named Ryan.  I assume.  Yep.  We figured that much out.  You did.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Uh, he's going to do a, a public Ryan announcement on Idiot Parkers.  Uh-oh.  Look at this.  People who just park like total idiots.  Put on your I Can Relate to this hat, people.  Well, you got to be relatable to the audience.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  First thing you learn.  That's, you want the listeners to go, that's like me.  Yes, I, I've done that.  Yes.  I've been there.  And now, a public Ryan announcement.  There's nothing worse than someone taking up two or more spots in a parking lot. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, no.  I mean, just because you have a big truck or a really fancy car, does that give you the  right to use multiple parking spaces?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Because of that greedy person, you couldn't find a spot, and you were forced to park across  the street and walk even further through the pouring rain.  Great.  Now I'm all wet.  Do us a favor.  If you own a larger vehicle or a super fancy car, do one of these two things.  Right.  A, you park across the street and walk the extra couple hundred feet. 
[03:18:00]  Getting soaked in the pouring rain will be your punishments.  Or B, simply leave your vehicle at home and call a cab.  Write that down.  There is no room in parking lots for space hoggers.  That was a PRA, public Ryan announcement.  It's like a battery car.  Okay.  I don't know how Scott snuck his way down.  I know.  Oh my God.  That is so bad.  First of all, if you've got a, it's not the vehicle itself. 
[03:18:30]  Like, if you drive a big vehicle.  Right.  There's assholes that take up two, now we're doing the bid again.  You see?  But there's assholes that take up two spots with their small car.  So you don't even have the concept, right?  No, it's not the big car.  It's not just big fucking cars.  I wheeled my Escalade into any parking space with nary a problem.  And this would be more of a show topic where you go back and forth.  Right.  Throw the ball around with the gills.  Exactly.  With the chicks.  And then maybe get a couple jokes in.  Maybe not.  But maybe you certainly would get some relatable material out there. 
[03:19:00]  But, uh...  And then you take phone calls.  Well, when I see a guy that takes up two spots, I fucking key their car.  I fucking spit on their car handle.  Sure, sure.  And then you do those phone calls.  And then you, if you're, like, not an edgy host, goes,  Well, that's crazy.  That's outrageous.  Oh, man.  I would never do that.  My God.  But you don't make it into some lame-ass who gives a fuck bit.  Right.  What?  Fresh 103 is not the station for you, then.  Oh, God, no.  Oh.  The new Fresh 103, by the way. 
[03:19:30]  What makes it new?  Exactly.  Tell me what makes your stupid station new.  Is that Ryan?  It already says fresh.  You don't need new as well.  Fresh means kind of new.  Yeah.  So why would you say fresh and new?  Ryan looks diverse.  You think so?  Yeah.  Which one's Ryan?  Right there.  Right here.  In the little striped V-neck.  Oh, God.  Sideway stripes.  Oof.  That's rough on everyone. 
[03:20:00]  I'm just having a blog called What We Learned on the Show.  What We Learned?  Yep.  Oh, that's interesting.  Sounds familiar.  Yep.  Whatever.  Wow, that was really bad.  They do a show with Bon Jovi?  That's kind of cool, though.  I think Bon Jovi is one of the musical artists.  Oh.  I don't think that Rihanna, Bon Jovi, and Bruno Mars are the morning teams.  Oh, they see their pictures on the website.  Wait, Rihanna does the show with them?  They were throwing the ball around, I thought.  Wow, that's kind of cool.  They all throw the ball around.  How do they get those guys on their fucking station on a daily basis? 
[03:20:30]  The dog bit was actually Bruno Mars' idea.  Wow, that's kind of cool.  You know how we attack radio from all angles?  This is one we've never touched on before.  The radio stations that know that their personalities are so shitty that no one gives a fuck about  them, that they actually promote their station by showing huge artists, like these artists  just kind of hang out at the station.  Yeah.  I think Z100 does it, doesn't it, Eric?  They definitely do billboards.  Instead of showing their jocks, it's like they show Katy Perry and fucking, I don't know, 
[03:21:00]  Lady Gaga.  Z100 is the one in New York that does it.  Look, like Miley Cyrus is on the Z100.  Well, they're promoting their dumb shit.  The jingle ball.  92.3 now does it.  There it is.  They have billboards all over New York.  It's like a CeeLo.  With no air personality.  Yeah, because they know their air personalities suck.  Everyone knows that part of the business is horrendous.  So how do we promote our radio station if our jocks suck?  Well, let's get pictures of the artists that we play on a billboard.  Yeah.  And these artists have no fucking awareness that they are connected with the radio station 
[03:21:30]  in that way.  What else 92.3 now does, too, with their imaging is you'll hear celebrities saying, hey, this  is Miley Cyrus.  Hey, this is, you know, whoever.  But they never say the station name or the jocks or anything.  They put their voice guy back in the middle of it.  Hey, wait a minute.  Go to the top of that page.  Oh, I don't want to.  Go ahead.  Sirius XM page.  Hey, look.  What?  Who is that?  Oh, Sirius does the same thing, I guess.  It's one.  Is that the morning mashup on that? 
[03:22:00]  No, that's Fall Out Boy in One Direction.  Oh.  See, I've been a company guy for a while now, but I have to point this out.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah.  I mean, your listeners aren't that stupid.  They know what music's played, by the way.  It's so neat to see pictures of the artists.  They could figure out if it's a top 40 channel that, safe to say, you're going to hear some  Katy Perry and some Bruno Mars in One Direction and whatever the fuck.  Or at least throw the girls up there with them. 
[03:22:30]  Right.  Throw the ladies up there.  They'd appreciate it.  Maybe have them all in sports jerseys because they'd love throwing the ball around a bit.  That's good.  But not team-branded jerseys.  It's a national show, after all.  Right.  True, true.  One more for today's Jacktober as we look at Prep Burger and some bonus tracks from  some fucking stations doing horrible bits.  Speaking of sports, it's World Series time.  That's right.  And very topical.  Red Sox got this, I'm telling you.  Oh, boy. 
[03:23:00]  I'm telling you, man.  They got this one.  I don't know.  They absolutely got it.  I have to say, I don't know.  Not knowing anything.  I might even watch a game or two.  I'll watch tonight until it's like 1230 and it's the third inning, and then I'm going  to have to tap out.  Who are they going to show on the stands up there in Fenway?  Who do you think?  What are the big Marky Mark?  You think Marky Mark will be in there?  Marky Mark.  Watching.  Fucking Dennis Leary.  You think Leary will be in there?  Maybe.  Who are the big celebs that we'll see up there in Bafferston? 
[03:23:30]  Lenny Clack.  Lenny Clack, perhaps, any other?  What about Scorch's friend?  Bill Burr.  Scorch's friend, Sib Hashian.  And the other guy, the comedian that was all pissed off.  I forgot his name.  Oh, Jimmy Tingle?  No.  Come on, help me out.  Does all the local fucking humor up there.  Humor.  Oh.  Fucking Scorch made him wait or something. 
[03:24:00]  He was all annoyed in the green room.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't remember his name.  Oh, shit.  Ah, whatever.  Damn it.  Holy fuck, we gotta know his name.  He's gonna be really bummed when this gets back to him.  Eric?  I'm trying to think of it.  I think we had him on the phone.  Oh, I got it.  And I didn't need any help in this.  Sweeney.  Oh, right.  I got it.  Just in the nick of time.  Yes.  Steve Sweeney, right?  Yes.  Anyway, here's our last bit for today's Jack Tober.  It's from a radio station in St. Louis. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, Stephen King, right.  Stephen King is always a big Boffiston fan.  The show's called Phillips and Company.  Really?  Yep.  What a fucking show about, like, screwdrivers.  We don't have to play the last bit.  It's fine.  And, of course, Neil Diamond.  Ah, Neil.  Maybe a little Sweet Caroline for everybody.  Of course.  Because it worked out so well the last time he did it live.  Terrible. 
[03:25:00]  But everyone had to praise him.  That was horrendous.  He fucked it up.  Yeah.  Why 98 in St. Louis?  They got a song.  Do you have a guess?  Nope.  Not a one.  Nope.  What kind of guess do we need?  It's probably What Do the Cards Say.  Oh, no!  It's a rallying song for the Cardinals.  What do the cards say?  It can't be What the Cards Say.  No way.  Win, win, win, win.  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer. 
[03:25:30]  Fuck you.  Come on.  I've got to hear it.  Who did you flip off?  That guy hates us.  Who is it?  I ain't saying that.  We're hated?  I thought we were beloved in these hallways.  We're mostly beloved.  We're beloved.  Here's Y98 and their new rallying song for the Cardinals.  All right.  Let's do this.  The World Series starts tonight.  What do the cards say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  These guys...  They didn't do this.  They rip off each other's horrible songs.  They didn't.  They didn't do that. 
[03:26:00]  Yes, they did.  It's exactly the same as the fucking shitty one that...  Let's have a little fun here today, people.  Except there's no first verse on the second verse.  Come on.  They couldn't even write a first verse?  Socks go boom.  Playoffs now.  Valentine fired.  Fans cheering loud.  Fenway Park.  Big poppy.  Play is back with Gomes and Napoli. 
[03:26:30]  Pitching staff with Lester's K's.  And our bats go pow, pow, pow.  But there's one sound that we all know.  And you don't even put it in the right spot.  Okay.  I got it.  Uh-huh.  Let's have a little fun.  All right.  What does the Socks say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  What does the Socks say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win. 
[03:27:00]  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  What does the Socks say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win. 
[03:27:30]  What the cards say  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer  Wow, that's really fucking awful  That's all you need to know  That they would do that  Happens all the fucking time in this stupid business  Damn  Thank God  You know, I'm going to take this opportunity 
[03:28:00]  To let you know about Russell Peters  Well, we weren't even talking about Russell  Well, I am  Oh  He just happens to be  Oh, no, no  What would Russell Peters say?

[03:30:30]  Hot only hooten high  Hot only hooten high  Opie and Anthony have left the building  After ONA live  With Sam Roberts  This is after Opie and Anthony live  Here's your host, Sam Roberts  Here he is  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number to call 
[03:31:00]  If you don't know that by now  We've got bigger issues  Than figuring out what a goddamn phone number is  I was glad that they brought up the 30 for 30 that was on ESPN last night  The Islanders  The Islanders documentary  Kevin Connolly  From Entourage  Did this documentary  Did this documentary  About this dude  Who wanted to buy the Islanders  But he had no money  But he lied about having money 
[03:31:30]  DJ Who kid has stopped in  How's it going my friend?  Speaking of liars  Yeah, exactly  And thieves  Yeah, there was this guy  Do you know  Of course you know the Islanders  Of course  I mean, I didn't know if you  I don't know how well black people know hockey  Yeah, missing teeth, blood  Okay, you got it  Well, this guy John Spano is 96  And the Islanders were in trouble  And this guy John Spano  Came in  And said  I'm a Texas billionaire  And he hung out with billionaires in Texas  And he had a nice house 
[03:32:00]  And he had a nice car  And he had a hot wife  And he goes  I want to buy the team  I want to buy the Islanders  And I'll give you  It was something in the line  Of like $170 million  That's it  That's all the Islanders  That's it  At that time, I guess  So do you have $170 million?  No, I know some billionaires  I could buy that shit right now  $0.50 could probably buy the Islanders  At that price  But  So he comes in  And he goes  I have the money  Trust me  And  I guess it was 96  So it was easier to lie about stuff  You know what I mean  There wasn't  Paper trails 
[03:32:30]  Were a little more difficult to find  You couldn't go back  Into people's bank records  Everything wasn't online  At a moment's notice  And the Islanders  Were in such trouble  That they were desperate  To sell the team  Because they had no money  They were winning  No kind of games  And people were getting  People wanted to move them  Because not the fans  Yeah  But you know  The NHL and the other owners  Were going to come in  And move them to another city  And this  John Spano comes in  He goes  Nope  I got all the money  I'm going to keep them  Right here  In Long Island 
[03:33:00]  What nobody realized  Was this was  Just an insane person  Who wanted to be a billionaire  And wanted to own a sports team  He was 32 years old  So he assumed  He was a billionaire  And so he just became one  And then decided  To convince somebody  To sell him a sports team  Some real shit  I don't even  Watch a lot of sports  And I was captivated  By this documentary  But like  All the tricks  That he had  So first  He had to convince  The first  I think it was 
[03:33:30]  He was able to get  70 million dollars  And he convinced  Fleet  To loan it to him  It was a bank loan  Because they assumed  He was a billionaire  Because he was like  Dude  I got it  I'm going to buy  The Islanders right now  I will get you back  Yeah  Don't even worry about it  That's funny  Right  I mean  Who kid  If you found out  You could get  A 70 million dollar  Bank loan  Oh my god  I'll get out of here  I'll go to Thailand  That would be it for you  Huh  50 year olds  You know what I'm saying  Boys or  Nah man 
[03:34:00]  Alright good  Good  But  So he got the money  And then  But he only got the 70 million  So he's like  Look I have 70 million now  And let me figure out  Some  Payment method  To get you the rest of it  And so they  They said  Okay you owe us  17 million dollars  You owe us  17 million now  And then every like  Six months  You owe us another  17 million  And he goes  Okay no problem  Got you  But he didn't have  The first payment  And so he shows up  He's like  Oh you wanted that today 
[03:34:30]  Like a little kid  With his homework  Oh you're kidding me  You wanted it today  No I don't have  I have the  I have the money  I got from  Fleet Bank  Are you serious  But I don't have  The other 17  And they were like  You'll get it to us though  Right  It's on Netflix  It's not on Netflix yet  It was on ESPN  Last night  Okay  And I'm sure  They'll replay it  But they were like  You'll get us back  You'll get us the 17  He goes  Of course  And they go  Okay  We'll sign the team  Over to you  Are you kidding me  So they sold him  The team  Like he owned it 
[03:35:00]  He became the owner  And they were like  But you're gonna give us  That money right  Of course  Of course  At one point  And I said it  On the air earlier  At one point  He transferred them  $1,700  Come on  You're lying  No  I swear to you  He transferred them  $1,700  And all these investors  Are going  Bro  Why would  This is $1,700  We need $17 million  From you  And he's on the other  End of the phone  Going  $1,700  That's outrageous 
[03:35:30]  That's  That's unfathomable  I'm gonna work on this  I'm gonna call you back  And I'm gonna work on this  He had every  One guy said  That there was an  There was an IRA bombing  In London  So the  You know  And the IRA does that  I guess from time to time  In London  But there was a bombing  Right  He saw that  On the news  That there was this bombing  And he said  The money that I owe you  Was in a briefcase  On its way  Come on  Out of that bank  Are you serious 
[03:36:00]  And the bombing happened  It's stuck now  Now it's gotta go  Throw all the paperwork again  I mean  He owned this team  For like  For three months  Without paying for them  So he was just  Taking a piss  At the whole thing  I guess  But I think  I think that he  He's one of those liars  That convinces himself  That what he's saying  Is true  That is ridiculous  Because he thought  He was gonna be able  To pull this thing off  I didn't know  Why people were stupid  Like that  I guess so  I guess so  He was going to like  Strip clubs every night  You proved me wrong  He was hanging out  With chicks  And going to strip clubs 
[03:36:30]  Every night  He was getting all the perks  Of being the islanders owner  That's what I would've did  Because that's what happens  When you're a billionaire  People start giving you stuff  For free  So people assumed  He was a billionaire  So he just started  Getting it for free  When they kicked him  Out of there  They said  Not only did he  Not pay for the team  He billed like  Two hundred thousand dollars  Worth of private jet rides  To the islanders  While he was the owner  That's an amazing story  It is an amazing story  He ended up going to jail  For a few years  Or whatever 
[03:37:00]  But he came back  And Kevin Connolly  From Entourage  Is the guy who did  This documentary  And he did an interview  With him  For the doc  John Spano  He was like  He's bald now  And he was on  Explaining what he did  Wow  And going yeah  He goes  Did you really do that  About the IRA bombing  He goes  I don't remember  Specifically doing that  But I can't say I didn't  It sounds like something  I would've said  Those early years  You could've got away 
[03:37:30]  With anything  And it wasn't even  That long ago  It was 96  I know  You remember 96  Yeah  A little more high tech  Back then right  A little  But not like it is now  You forget  How much fraud  I guess it was  It was probably  A lot more difficult  To steal someone's  Identity back then  Like you couldn't  Steal information  But you also could  Just lie about shit  You know what I mean  People believed  That he was a billionaire  Because of  Because he had a nice  Because he had a nice suit  Because he had a nice car  It was ridiculous  And because they were like  Well he can't  Plus they wanted to sell 
[03:38:00]  The team so bad  To this guy  They were like  We just want this  To be true  So bad  That we're going to  Overlook all this bullshit  You think there's someone  Out there doing that now  Like tricking someone  Like  I'm sure they're  What about Bernie Madoff  What  He had all these people  Investing in this Ponzi scheme  And all these people  Celebrities were investing  With him  And he's permanently  Jailed up  He's jailed up forever  And people were giving  Their entire life fortunes  To him  Didn't this kid  Shoot himself  I think so  Something like that  Shot himself in the nose  Or something 
[03:38:30]  I think it was a suicide  I'm not sure if he literally  Shot himself in the nose  But  Holy shit  But people were handing over  Their whole life savings to him  Because  This stuff that he was promising  Him was so good  If it's true  This is going to be wonderful  I just have to believe  It's true  Because I heard about that  Because Obama  Might not be really  You know  He might not be the president  Though  It's on the low  Huh  Whatever  You think  You think Obama  Lied his way to the White House  Hey  White people are stupid now  I guess so  And Obama's one of them 
[03:39:00]  Sucker  Let me go to 423  You guys  Been lying about a lot of stuff then  What's up buddy  Shit  Sam fucking Roberts  The master broadcaster  What's up dude  How's he going  What's up dude  And DJ  Who kid man  What's up bro  What up God  Hey man  Anybody ever come up to you  That's the code for the killers  I don't know what this guy's talking about  I'm done with him though  617 
[03:39:30]  Hey Sam  Hey  Great show Monday  Unbelievable  I can't stop watching it  Oh thanks  Who kid  I got a question for you  I know Mike was sick  This past weekend  If he's better  Are you going to take him to the club  Mike Buschetti  My next date  Mike Buschetti  Yeah my next date is the second  And I did hit him up on Twitter  And I did text him  But he said he was sick  With something in his throat  I'm going to get into this in a little bit  Something in his throat  He said he said he had something in his mouth  Did you get to the bottom of what that was  I don't know what it was  I didn't ask  We'll get to it in a few minutes 
[03:40:00]  Mike Buschetti is not the only person you invited out that's turned you down  Wait till you hear this  Wait till you hear this  231 you're on the show  Yeah hey  On the  Islanders thing  The Nashville Predators  CNBC did a  World documentary  Nashville Predators  Was owned by a guy  Kind of the same way  A Ponzi scheme runner  Amazing  It's amazing  Like  I guess you just have to be a good enough talker 
[03:40:30]  Is it a hockey thing?  I don't know  You think hockey executives are just dumb?  I guess they're not checking them out  I don't know  No  No  I'm telling you man  I'm a billionaire  And how do you have to feel  When you realize  That you just sold this team  To a guy who didn't have any money  And like everything is  Presented in front of you  Like people are going  You actually believed him when he said this?  We don't understand  In the context of what was going on  It seemed so good  It seemed right  And the Islanders were doing so poorly 
[03:41:00]  I mean  How did he get  So they never got their money back?  Even though he went to jail?  The money's gone  No he  Eventually  They outed him  They were like  Dude  There is  You can't have the team  Like you have  So  They got him  To sign the team  Back over to them  Does he have photos with the team?  Yeah dude  He was in the owner's box  He went out to the  Where the Islanders party  Like he did everything  He had a jersey  It was so funny  One of the photos  In the documentary  Was him  John Spano 
[03:41:30]  Holding up a jersey  An Islanders jersey  That said Spano  Across the back  They made him his own jersey  I mean  They gave him the royal treatment  Yeah he's the man  God  All the players  Thought he was awesome  They were like  Look at this guy  Taking an interest in the team  Yeah I respect him man  If he could do it  I respect him  And then he goes  He said  At the end of this documentary  He goes  You know  My dad told me something  That I carry with me  He said  Son  You went out there  And you tried  A lot of people  Don't even try  So you can be proud of yourself  I'm shouting at my TV 
[03:42:00]  Going  He didn't try to do anything  He lied  He just went in  And stole and lied  And made shit up  That's why  There's this thing  In my world called  Fake it till you make it  Is that right  And everybody goes by it  Well I mean  This is like  To the next level  Of fake it till you make it  That's like some  Billionaire million  I mean I don't know man  But Kevin Connolly  He's gonna be on my show  This Sunday  So I can talk to him  About it then  Chop it up about that  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Cause he's a big  Islanders fan  So he must have been  Psyched to make this movie 
[03:42:30]  Plus he interviewed everybody  Wayne Gretzky's in it  Get out of here  Yeah dude  Is it true you could buy  Their blood at the stadium  I don't think they sell  The blood at the stadium  No I mean  You could like  Put blood in your body  Like you know  But you pay for that  No I don't think so  Oh no  Somebody told me that  It seems like a business opportunity  Kevin in Houston  Hey Sam  Hey who kid  What up God  Hey  I used to run a  High end cigar and scotch bar  And we had a  Individual  I don't know if you remember  Her name  R. Allen Stanford 
[03:43:00]  On Stanford Financial  He had a Ponzi scheme  Going like Bernie Madoff did  But that fucker  Would come in the bar  And run up  Two and three  And four thousand dollars  And just walk out  And just leave  And just leave  Yeah  Cause he's a billionaire  What are you gonna complain  He's like  I'll bring my business elsewhere  And you're going  You don't give us any business  You're not spending any money  Later boys  Later man  He was saying  He had no credit card on file  Like I don't understand  Nothing  So you gotta trust a white guy  That's supposedly rich  Can order two three G's of stuff 
[03:43:30]  And pop no credit card  That's the world we live in  Who can white people  They can just go in and order  And then just walk out  Cops don't come  They be taking my boy's ATM card  Not only  Not only can we just walk out  But we're welcome to come back next time  That's crazy  Oh we got a table for you  Regular table Mr. Roberts  That is amazing  It is isn't it  You can't stop being racist  Against your own color  Because it's  Because it's despicable  You can't  White people should not trust  White people anymore  You can't  This is ridiculous  They said  This guy John Spano 
[03:44:00]  The supposed billionaire  Who was supposed to buy  The island  Who said he  Bought the islanders  For no money  He would have like  Investors and people  They would come in  And they'd have like  Big business lunches with them  And the waiter would bring the check  And when you're a team owner  And you've got investors  Or advertisers  Or whoever coming in  Obviously the owner's  Going to pick up the check  Right  The billionaire picks up the check  Right  You go to lunch with Bill Gates  And he's talking to you  About something  I'm getting up  I'm like I'm out 
[03:44:30]  Exactly  Got it  God  They said the investors  Were on the documentary  Going  We just stared at the check  For minutes  No  Because nobody was picking it up  He would not pick that check up  It's like me and 50  Having dinner  50 doesn't like to pick up the check  50 doesn't pay for shit  He doesn't  Rich people don't pay  I don't know  I don't know what world you're in  But  So does he make you pay  I pay for the dinner  Really  It was like $330  We went to eat somewhere  And you can't expense that  To G-Unit recordings  Or vitamin water 
[03:45:00]  Or something  It's like fuck you  He gets up  He does  God damn  This Jay-Z thing  He owned  I think the nets for 1%  Is that real?  Like half of a percent  You're bringing up all this  Oh you think Jay-Z was just like  I think Jay-Z lied  God  I got you  Yeah  Ho  Ho  What's half of a percent?  Like what is that?  It's half of a percent  Well you can break it down  You're talking about  So what is it like  30 white businessmen  Is like yo  We're not letting this nigga in  Let's give him  Half of a fucking percent  Half of a percent  What is that? 
[03:45:30]  And then who could like  I got you  What is half of a percent?  What the fuck is that?  I want to see the contract right now  You do?  Pull it up man  I don't have it  I don't have it on me  What do all white people have every contract?  We just love paperwork  What the fuck is half of a percent?  Michael in New Hampshire  That's what black people get  When they want to be owners  Half of a percent  They also get 40 acres  We ain't coming in  God  No  And a mule  What's up Michael?  Hey Sam  What's up guy?  What up God?  The best part about that documentary 
[03:46:00]  Is at the end  When the target  The guy's doing the interview  And Spano's like  Well  Technically  They already signed the team over to me  So I was doing them a favor  Yeah  Yeah  I'm going to be like a good guy about it  He goes  That's exactly right  Because he goes  He goes  Yeah I bought the team  So technically I own them  Even though  They sucked  I didn't give them any money  Yeah  And he said  So if I had wanted to  I could have just brought the team into bankruptcy  I decided to sign it over  Like he's this great guy  He's a great guy 
[03:46:30]  This is this guy  This teaches you something about trusting white people  Who can  This John Spano  He went to jail for this thing he did with the Islanders  Yeah  I think he did four or so years  He got out of jail  He spent about six months getting back into business  Went right back into jail for fraud again  Get the fuck out of here  He frauded again  Ron in Baltimore  Stupid little fuck of it  What's up buddy  Hey man  Hey I used to have a buddy in the 90s  When the internet was brand new 
[03:47:00]  And really kicking off with pictures  And before porn  He started his whole porn thing  Where he had his camcorder thing hooked to his computer  And he would advertise like a dollar a minute  To see girls strip or nude  And all these guys from like the Middle East  That didn't have access to porn or nothing  They would tap in with their credit cards  And he would charge them like a hundred to a thousand dollars a minute  They couldn't track them back in those days  So he's just running up credit cards  His camcorder he would focus on Playboy 
[03:47:30]  Pictures  And I swear to god  He made  It was like a year or two  And I think the banks came down on him  He made like a million, two million dollars  Jesus Christ  I swear to god  Never went to jail  Amazing  Thank you Ron  But that was when you could do that  When the internet was first starting  I mean it was proof of stupidity  You could make a lot of money off of that  But it's always funny to see people get greedy  Because it never lasts  Like people just keep going  You keep playing  You keep pushing it  Well yeah  Kevin Connolly  We'll talk about that with him  This Sunday at 4pm Eastern

[03:50:30]  Great book  Great book  Read read read  Um  Who Kid  I asked you to come in today  Because  Yesterday  You and I were  Listening to the Ron and Fez show  In my office  That's right  Who Kid and I  Socialized  And you were not  You knew Ron and Fez  Yeah but I heard their show  Here and there  But I finally heard a full show  Right  And I just was  I couldn't stop laughing  Well Who Kid  Listened to Ron and Fez yesterday  And the topic of conversation  Was trying to get Fez some dick  And  I mentioned to Who Kid 
[03:51:00]  That this is kind of a regular topic  On Ron and Fez  That the whole  Staff of the show  Is concerned about Fez  And they want to  They want to get him  A nice dick for himself  Ever since he came out  He came out of the closet  About  I don't know  Two or three years ago  At this point  But he hasn't had any dick  Serious  I'm serious  He's a gay virgin  How is that  What do you mean  He's like  How can you be a gay virgin though  Well that's  He's gay but he hasn't had sex  How old are you  He's like 30, 20  No he's much  He's much older than that 
[03:51:30]  He's  He's  He's up there  What  Yeah  But Who Kid  You were listening  Gay virgin  Serious  Yeah  Alright  You were listening  Cool guy though  And you said  This guy's hilarious  I want to take this guy  To the club with me  Did you not say that  Yeah  You want to find Fez  A dick  No I was going to  Take him to the club  I mean if this dick's in there  He could grab it  But I'm just saying  I just want to take Fez  He's a cool dude  I've been hollering at him  For years  Coming back and forth  Is that a sexual thing  Hollering at him 
[03:52:00]  I'm not hollering like that  No homo  But I'm just like you know  It's cool  Like you know  He's a cool guy  Funny guy too  Right right  And you want to bring him  To the club  I want to get him on my show  Right  Because you guys say  He don't talk  Right  So I wanted to prove  You know all you guys wrong  I wanted to do a full show  On Eminem's channel  How long is your show?  It's like five hours  Okay  And you wanted to do  The whole thing  The whole entire thing  Alright  But you guys are telling me  That you know  He don't party  I'm like yo  I'll take him to one of my clubs  You want to take him to a club  So on November 2nd 
[03:52:30]  Maybe I can take Fez out  It's a greenhouse  Well Fez has an issue with me  Because  At the beginning of this month  When Jocktober first started  On the Opie and Anthony show  Yeah  I brought in some audio  To the guys of Fez  Complaining  That a commercial was insensitive  Because they used the word crazy  A bunch of times  Oh for real?  And he thought that  That was offensive  Oh for real?  To people with mental illness  And it was a ridiculous break  I think that anybody  Would admit that  But Fez was very offended 
[03:53:00]  That I brought that to the show  And then developed  Something in his head  That I am single handedly  Trying to build an army  Against him somehow  I don't exactly know  But apparently  I am a bully  Are you?  That's been bullying Fez  Do you know me as a bully?  I don't see you like that  You're a pussy  Yeah  That's what I try to tell everybody  But Fez thinks of me as a bully  You're like a kitty cat  So I texted  My friend from the  Ron and Fez show  Pepper Hicks  And told him  Who kid is in my office  Listening to Fez talk about 
[03:53:30]  Wanting to find himself a dick  He wants to bring Fez  To the club with him  Yeah  And this was their response  Yesterday on the  Ron and Fez show  Fez you've got an offer  Right now  From Chris  Well it's not from Chris  But it was sent to you  Yeah  Sam  Tells me that  DJ Who kid  Was hearing your woes  About not being able  To find a dude  And wants to take you  Out to the club  This Saturday  What kind of club?  Duck club  Duck club 
[03:54:00]  Is that what you're  Talking about?  The one that 50 cents  Sings about?  Yeah  Yeah  Popping bottles right?  Pop that shit  That's accurate so far right?  Yeah  What was just said?  Yeah  Very accurate  Alright  No  No  I decline the offer  This is coming from Sam  Sam's relaying the message  Yes  Yeah  Yeah  This  I smell set up  And no thank you  I'm not falling  Falling into Sam's trap  Well if you went with Who Kid 
[03:54:30]  I don't  I think Who Kid can be trusted  Yeah  I mean  He's always hanging with Fitty  Hell yeah  He's the man's fucking DJ  I don't even know if Who Kid  Is part of this for real  With it coming from Sam  Well I don't have  It's insane  Who Kid's phone number  So he couldn't text me himself  Is this because  Carrie just came out  Last weekend  Did you see yourself  As SiriusXM Carrie  I'm gonna end up  With a bucket of pig's blood  All over me  That isn't pig blood  You're gonna end up  With all over you  Disgusting  You know what he's saying 
[03:55:00]  Right Who Kid  Not pig's blood  Will you  He's talking about cum  Oh  Will you  Ah shit  State it for the record  You invited Fez to go to the club  Yeah  Matter of fact  The 30th  We'll do Halloween  That way he can hide  Come with a costume  Uh huh  Whatever costume he wants to wear  How about whatever works best for him  The 30th  November 2nd  Whatever works best for him  I think the 30th would be perfect  You do  That way we could be costumed up  You know what I'm saying  Right right right  I understand  Although  You probably want to put  Some kind of restrictions  I want Fez 
[03:55:30]  I'm gonna be the nigga  Spider-Man  So I want  Okay well Fez  Last time I saw Fez wearing a costume  He was dressed as Hitler  In a diaper  Get the fuck out of here  That's gangster  You call himself  If he came as baby Hitler  That would be fine  I don't know  If my Jewish friends would love him  But  He could do what he wants  That's the question  But this is not me  This is not some grand scheme of mine  Yeah  Like everything else apparently is  It was my idea  To invite him  And I try to do the nice thing  Yeah  Well Ron continued to talk about 
[03:56:00]  The invitation a little bit  Why don't you go out with who kid  And maybe you'll be able to  You know  Get some  Party up a little bit  I didn't know who kid was so gay  I guess with the name who kid  It's got to be good  I didn't know either  It smells very suspicious to me  That's racist dude  He'll get Fez some dick I guess  Some what?  Some dick  On his  If he wants to  They can go to Jersey  And get married if they want to  Now who kid  Clear that up for the record 
[03:56:30]  Are you offering your dick to Fez?  I'm not offering him any dick  But you're saying  You'll take him out to a nice night  He'll be able to be social  He'll have a good time  Give him some diddy moisture  You know what I'm saying?  Diddy moisture  Ciroc  Ciroc yeah  You're talking about diddy's alcohol  Yeah  Oh  Get that clear  Oh okay  Alright  I wouldn't give him no dick  Come on man  My dick is for you know  The holes  The holes?  The assholes?  No  The moisture hole  The girls  Oh okay  So Ron's question about your sexuality  Yeah I'm good  You know  I mean 
[03:57:00]  I don't know  I'm not kicking it to Fez  Just like I invited Mike Bruchetti last week  And he canceled on me  Right  Alright he said he had something in his mouth  I don't know what it was  Right  He had a bump in his mouth  So he didn't want to come out  Okay  So I asked Fez  I didn't get no no from Fez yet  Well now he's saying no  Because he thinks I'm setting him up  Yeah that's what I'm saying  But it's not a setup  Let's make it clear  Come to the Halloween joint  I'm going to be the nigga Spider-Man  Okay  That's your costume  I'm going to be spraying like webs on people's faces 
[03:57:30]  Right  You know but I just want him to come out  He come out  Hopefully Fez will get some webs sprayed on his face  I don't know about that  If that's what he's into  I don't know  If that's what would be a good time  One more  Innocent Fez  One more  Oh god  One more clip  Oh shit  You don't trust Sam anymore?  No  I noticed you and Sam didn't talk to each other  No  Is it because of Jacktober?  Yes  He's lost my trust  He's lost any confidence I had in him  I didn't know that you had trust or confidence in him  I might have at one time 
[03:58:00]  It's all gone  I can see you all oxied up on his show like Jenna Jameson  I can't even see anybody  You know I don't understand Fez  He ran me down on Ron and Fez  He called me a bully  He said all these things about me  And I didn't even come in to defend myself  I said alright  I said let Fez have this one  You know what I mean?  If this is what's going to make him feel better  If he thinks that I have some kind of grand scheme against him  Let him have his time in the sun  And get past this thing 
[03:58:30]  Why is he going to trust you?  You are like so pussy  I'm trying to bring some joy into this man's life  Who kid?  Anybody  Yo Fez should trust you  Because you're a nice guy  Thank you  You gave me like donuts every time I come up here  Well I have to  I'm trying to win your friendship  Like you know  Who gives donuts every fucking time you're up here?

[04:00:00]  And he hangs out with  Successful  Yeah he's got a lot of money  Yeah he's paid  He's got a great job  He's got guap and shit  Right I think so  He's got a lot of guap  They say he gave you all the richest people out there  Is that right?

[04:01:30]  Whoa!  The great Ron Bennington is entered  Oh shit  So let me in  What's the move here?  We're jumping Fez?  Is that what this is all about?  We're taking him out  And trying to yank his pants down  And take a picture  Put it on Instagram  You know Ron  I don't know why he doesn't  I don't know why Fez don't trust Sam  I wanted Fez to come out to the club  And party hard  And pop bottles  This guy is scaring Fez every week  I don't know what's going on up here  It's called bullying  I've read about it 
[04:02:00]  I've seen it on TV  It's bullying  Is that what it is?  Yeah  And now he says he's really looking out  To see what  How this thing is supposed to play out  There is no thing to play out  Like I don't know  There's never been a plan  There isn't a plan now  It was just  The whole deal was  He said  He was offended by a commercial  That used the word crazy  That was a long time ago Sam  That's all there is  You're still fucking writing this  It's either that  Or you have a porn star on Oxy  I mean  You're becoming a shock job 
[04:02:30]  You're better than that  You don't like it?  Well it's the 90s  That's early 90s  You're right  And Ron agrees that you're a pussy  He's a pussy too  Oh yeah  He definitely is  But he's a puppet master  I mean he's like an evil genius  Yeah  I would say you're like Sam Jackson  In Unbreakable  Where yeah  You could get beat up easy  But you use your cunning  To figure out how to wreck trains  And this time  Fez thinks he's the train  You think he's manipulating my party?  Oh absolutely  No  Sam 
[04:03:00]  I'm puppet mastering  Who Kid and Fez  Come on Sam  Well you do everything  Right now  I think the best way to put this  Is Blacklist  I don't know whether you follow the show  On Monday nights  But it's  It's an evil genius  Who gets people to do things  Even though they think  It's their idea  I see  There's something  That you have planned  Probably pig's blood  Falling on Fez  Something along those lines  Right  Yeah we saw  Fez thinks he is  The Sirius XM version of Carrie  Damn 
[04:03:30]  I don't know if people are  Paying that much attention  I think he's just a guy  Who works here  I'm going to give you  A little something  To pay attention to  Someone bought him  A shirt yesterday  That everybody thought  Was great  He's wearing it again today  For the second straight day  Because he got compliments  That's not how it works  He got compliments  So he's got the shirt back  I didn't even bring it up  But I saw him this morning  Up front  And I'm like  Rocking the shirt  I just saw him  That was a nice shirt 
[04:04:00]  Yeah it was nice yesterday  But you do  If you like a shirt  You get a couple of them  And then you can rotate  Well it was a present  Right  Yeah  So he's just doing that one then  Maybe it's  Maybe it's the only shirt  He would accept pig's blood on  I don't know what  You have planned right now  But someone's probably  Going to end up being hurt  I could just see that happening  Yo  Let's make it easy for Fez  Just go through my Instagram  And look at my parties  And then  I just want him to be part  Of my Instagram history  But this pussy right here  Why are you insulting me? 
[04:04:30]  I mean in a nice way  Okay  Alright  This vaginal dude right here  Is just  Maybe you are tricking us  I don't know  I don't think so  Did you use me?  I don't think so  Was it your idea  Or Who Kid's idea?  I believe it was Who Kid's idea  It was originally my idea  But maybe he  But was there hints  There was like  You know like  I mean I definitely  Turned the show up for him  And said Who Kid  You gotta listen to  Running Fez  This is  This is the show  This is Running Fez  You didn't finger me  Did you?

He's in entertainment  How is it a bad thing  When somebody brings your name up? 
[04:07:00]  You put a spotlight on him  He doesn't like that  It's the  Call Ron and Fez  It's the show  Maybe we'll get out  Fez and smack you live on air  And then it'll be over  When Jocktober ends  Can this finally be over?
