<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about Starbucks – its declining coffee quality, poor service, and plans to serve alcohol, sparking debate about potential increased disturbances.  A listener’s photo of a person with an oversized monitor in a Starbucks led to a broader conversation about inconsiderate public behavior. This transitioned into personal anecdotes, including one host losing a camera in a taxi and the ensuing quest to recover it, fueled by concerns about compromising photos.  The conversation then shifted to family life; one host announced his sister's pregnancy, prompting discussion about family size, uncleship, and the host's aversion to parenthood.  The topic segued into Ancestry.com, its inaccuracies, and the humorous aspects of its commercials and coats of arms.  The show concluded this segment with discussions about aging, daytime television (General Hospital, The Chew), the authenticity of car theft reality shows, and Jon Stewart's reaction to Obama's State of the Union address.  Mention was made of Oscar de la Hoya and a Fox News personality, but these remained undeveloped.

The next segment dove into celebrity gossip.  It started with Demi Moore's reported seizure after using whippets, leading to speculation about her relationship with Ashton Kutcher and potential eating disorder.  The hosts heavily criticized a photograph of Moore.  The discussion continued with Armie Hammer's marijuana arrest, triggering commentary on marijuana prohibition.  The hosts then discussed a lawsuit against Oscar De La Hoya, with graphic speculation about his sexuality and the plaintiff's motivations. A rape accusation against a Fox News personality, Greg Kelly, followed, with the hosts expressing skepticism and concern about public accusations before conviction. The segment included an old Jenna Jameson commercial for Matthews strip club and a best man speech contest featuring poorly submitted entries.  The segment concluded with an in-studio interview with Henry Winkler, who discussed his new children's book, *Ghost Buddy*, his *Happy Days* experiences, his dyslexia, and the Chuck Cunningham mystery.

The following segment continued with Henry Winkler, who shared anecdotes about *Happy Days* fame, including overwhelming fan encounters and unexpected kindness from Native American communities. He discussed his current projects and his television viewing habits.  A caller's story about her dyslexic son benefiting from Winkler's Hank Zipzer books prompted a discussion about dyslexia.  Jim Norton, another guest, promoted his stand-up tour. He and Winkler discussed their collaborative writing process.  D.L. Hughley joined, and the conversation turned to prostate issues, with Hughley and Norton sharing experiences. The discussion then shifted to the Republican presidential debates, with humorous commentary on the candidates.  The segment ended with the reading of listener-submitted "Fuck You" messages.

A caller's account of a childhood sexual proposition by a 20-something man launched the next segment.  The hosts and caller discussed the incident, the caller's revenge, and parental responsibility. One host discussed his relationships with his daughters, touching upon anxieties about their sexual experiences.  The conversation then focused on his son with Asperger's, including his recent graduation and his first sexual encounter.  The difficulties of raising a son with Asperger's were discussed, along with broader issues of male-female relationships and personal anecdotes about arguments and dominance/submission dynamics. The host shared details about his marriage to a religious woman, their differing views, his opinions on organized religion (particularly within the Black community), and his perspective on monogamy.  He mentioned enjoying *The Book of Mormon* musical and a negative taxi experience. The segment concluded with promotion of the host's comedy shows, containing numerous sexually explicit and offensive comments.

The final segment featured D.L. Hughley promoting his Showtime special and joking about adding Black men to the endangered species list.  The conversation shifted to a remembrance of Patrice O'Neal, with shared anecdotes and expressions of grief. Hughley mentioned upcoming appearances on Jay Leno and Live with Kelly.  The segment concluded with Anthony Cumia's "True Confessions" about wearing women's silky underwear.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning.  I guess we start with that every day.  Yeah, we do.  Hoping it's a good morning for everybody involved.  Yeah.  In this process that is the Opium Antelope Program.  I hate Starbucks coffee.  Why?  I don't know.  I get it all the time.  I know.  Because, uh, out of habit. 
[00:00:30]  I used to be a deli coffee guy.  Yeah.  It goes back to my time when I had to do part-time radio in Geneva, New York.  Geneva?  And I didn't start drinking coffee until I was in my early 20s because I had to stay up after, you know, because I would drink all day and then go to, you know, then drive to the radio station to entertain the people of Geneva, New York.  Yeah.  With a fine radio station called CQ102 Hit Music and More.  CQ102. 
[00:01:00]  So that's when the coffee, uh, habit started.  Yeah.  And then one day the Starbucks thing happened, right?  I was turned on to good coffee when I went to Seattle, matter of fact.  And then Starbucks, uh, spread across the country.  And I'm like, yes.  And I really liked the Starbucks coffee.  But I don't know what, I don't know.  Did they change their recipe a few years ago?  Aren't they constantly, like, futzing with it?  I don't think their coffee's as good as it used to be.  Futsing.  Because now, uh, uh, other little coffee shops are popping up in the neighborhood and their coffee's, their coffee way better. 
[00:01:30]  They became, like, the big corporation.  Yeah.  Because I think.  The little guys.  I think they have to make so much at one time that I don't know if it's, if they're getting the recipe right.  Especially with half the people that work at Starbucks.  Let's be honest.  What are you talking about?  You used to have these people that they knew coffee.  They loved coffee.  Their whole life was about coffee.  They would almost have an orgasm as they're giving you the coffee. 
[00:02:00]  Like, oh, try the aroma.  Coffee did that.  And they would explain what the roast is every day.  And now you got these fucking animals just dumping water and here's your coffee.  Giant loads of coffee.  I don't know.  I hope Starbucks isn't an advertiser because I, out of habit, I drink it every morning and I don't think I like it anymore.  I don't remember reading any Starbucks things.  Steven Singer is selling Starbucks now.  Well, you heard they're going to be serving beer and wine at Selective Starbucks. 
[00:02:30]  I heard that.  No word on when New York is going to be pulled into that whole thing.  I think they're doing it in.  Atlanta?  Yeah.  I saw Atlanta and whatever.  Another city like Atlanta.  They're trying to class up the gerontine.  So you could sit there, get a little glass of wine and be on the computer in the place.  See, I get up early on weekends, too, and my thing is to go to a Starbucks, chill out, maybe do some tweeting or check email or read newspapers.  I can't imagine now I'm going to have to deal with fucking assholes that had a few beers. 
[00:03:00]  Give me a fucking beer.  Yeah, you think there's going to be a time where they can buy or can't buy?  In New York?  Yeah.  If it goes well in Atlanta, they'll do it everywhere.  Why not?  That's more money.  You think like six in the morning you'd be able to go in and get a glass of wine?  Yeah, why not?  Oh, Jesus.  That's what I'm talking about.  That's crazy.  You're going to have assholes.  I mean, you already have assholes in Starbucks, but at least they keep it down.  Bunch of belligerent fucking hipsters.  Did you see, I don't know, because I think we pretty much all get the same tweets. 
[00:03:30]  A guy tweeted me a picture of a guy in Starbucks.  You know, most people usually bring their little laptop and they kind of plug in and they don't take up much room.  Quietly clickety-clacking in the corner.  I didn't know I was going to talk about this to start the show and I don't even know why, but the guy sends me a picture.  This asshole at Starbucks set up a monster monitor.  For what?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What a douchebag.  A monster. 
[00:04:00]  Like, I'm trying to give you, I don't know.  Like a 30-inch?  Like one of Sam's TV.  Ah.  Bigger than Sam's TV.  It's got to be bigger than Sam's TV.  I would say bigger than Sam's TV.  If that guy's listening right now, I don't know if he is, resend the picture.  This guy had an obnoxious fucking screen at Starbucks.  Like, he set up camp for the day.  What a douche.  And I'm like, how did he get the monitor in?  I guess they're that light where you can just carry them in now.  Cool.  Yeah.  So.  I don't know.  I have no reason to go. 
[00:04:30]  I don't drink coffee, really.  Occasional espresso with some Zambuco when I'm out.  But, uh.  You never got into the coffee habit?  No.  Never really drank a lot of coffee.  When we first met, I forced you to drink coffee.  Oh, I was drinking a lot of coffee then.  Before you became an individual.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because under my reign.  Oh, it was coffee and coffee.  Under my reign, when I was at BAB for, what, two or three years?  Everyone drank.  Anyone that came in, I forced them, like a drug dealer, to drink coffee. 
[00:05:00]  Another cup of coffee?  And lots of it.  Another cup of coffee?  Hey, I'm driving home, fucking gritting my teeth and shaking.  Oh, man.  It was so bad how much coffee we drank.  I do remember that one.  And then we'd go out to the bars.  So now you got the caffeine, you got the alcohol.  Yeah.  Now there's just idiots.  Idiot pictures.  That guy set up a fucking giant.  Old school computer.  CRT monitor.  And he's got like a 486 in front of him.  That's someone's art project. 
[00:05:30]  They didn't actually do that.  Somebody's.  Someone set that up to get reaction shots for some project.  Yeah.  Man, look at me.  I'm going to go into Starbucks with an old 486 and a giant monitor and be fucking weird guy.  Yeah.  I turned off everything yesterday.  The world's cool.  Did you?  Yeah.  Every once in a while I don't really tweet.  I don't watch TV.  I just fucking turn everything off. 
[00:06:00]  Decompress.  Which is bad for what we do for a living.  But every once in a while I just fucking go.  I step, I step, I step out.  Yeah.  Everything's cool?  That's probably a good thing to do every so often.  Yeah.  That's why I think I'm talking about coffee because I didn't watch any of the news.  You missed a big story.  Didn't really follow Twitter that much or Facebook.  Yeah.  What's the big story, Jim?  I left my camera in a taxi.  Oh, my God.  I don't mean to laugh.  I know.  No.  No.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  I laugh because I know what kind of pain that has to be.  Did you?  Because my jacket, I'm so stupid.  I put it in my side pocket and it's deep.  When you sit, it fell out.  I knew better.  And I got out and I was going to leave and go out to lunch.  And I always just bring the camera anyway.  I looked all over for it.  I started to panic.  Worst feeling ever.  And I'm like, uh-oh.  Had you backed it up?  I had.  I think most of it.  Most? 
[00:07:00]  I think so.  Who wasn't on there?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What about the picture you took out here the other day with the red grave?  It's already backed up.  Oh, it is.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  You're fine.  You're fast.  You're fast.  You might have missed one picture.  Wow.  Well, there may be some things on there that you don't want.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, that part.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Did you call the taxi?  I have two receipts that I called.  One got me through the TLC because they didn't.  The taxi limit was in.  10 to 11 care?  Oh, don't be fresh. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, Jimmy.  They didn't have the garage number.  And one I called the garage.  You're never getting that camera again.  Well, I got a call from the first one.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And no one found it.  You have to rely on people.  Oh, no.  Here's the problem.  Oh, no.  Because you leave the camera in the backseat, right?  If it's a nice camera, the next person coming in, you have to hope.  They want a camera.  Is white. 
[00:08:00]  You got to hope they're white.  Yeah.  You got to hope they're a good Samaritan because if they're not, they're taking that shit.  You're just taking that shit.  Let me think.  I would look at that camera.  I slide in that backseat.  I'm like, yeah, take me to the fucking downtown.  I'm going to the bar.  Yeah.  Just pick a bar.  Take me to a fucking bar.  And I look over and I see a camera there.  I'd be like, oh.  I'd grab it.  The first thing I'd do is turn it on and start going through the pictures.  Of course.  And then when I see a few winners, I'd be like, I'm taking the camera until I could really spend 
[00:08:30]  some time and look at every single picture.  If, B, I was a fan of the show, let's say, and I realized, oh, my God, this is Jim Norton's  camera, I would download every picture off of it and then I would probably return it  to you anonymously and then just haunt you by posting your pictures everywhere.  One by one.  One by one of dicks and chicks with dicks and whatever else you have on there.  No, no, no.  That's not the camera.  I'm teasing. 
[00:09:00]  Of course, Jimmy.  But then there's the situation where people will take the camera, but they'll throw the  car away immediately.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They do that with phones.  They don't know.  It's just like, yeah.  I lost a, I left a phone in a bathroom once and I had hundreds of pictures on there.  From the bathroom?  From the bathroom.  I was doing some upskirts and under the stall shots.  Nice.  And by the time I realized I left the phone in the stall and ran back, it couldn't have  been more than two minutes.  He was here, right?  No, it was Lincoln Center. 
[00:09:30]  I remember that happened here once too, though.  Oh, yeah.  Here.  Oh, yeah.  That was a big deal because someone fucking did take my camera and then I called out,  I called everyone out on it and they went through security tapes and guess what?  That fucking phone was returned.  But in this other case, less than two minutes between, leaving the stall, realizing I fucking  left my phone, running back in a panic like, please, please, please, please, and it was  gone.  And then I tried calling the phone and it was already, the card was already out of it. 
[00:10:00]  Stump eggs.  The card was already out of it.  So someone grabbed, they knew what they were doing, took the cards out, threw them in  the fucking garbage, probably.  I probably should have checked the garbage right in the bathroom and I probably would  have at least got the cards back.  Well, I called and I got a call back from a woman who works for the Tax Lizzie Commission  and said she spoke to the driver and he had the camera.  Oh.  No.  He had the camera.  Apparently so.  But she said, he thought an old woman left it in there for something like, he must be  up with somebody else. 
[00:10:30]  Understandable.  Maybe he saw your pictures.  That's kind of some old woman left the camera.  Some old bitty who annoys famous people.  Old woman that likes a lot of taffy.  Old woman.  On her chest.  Really strange pictures.  Oh, fuck, you lucked out.  He's a guy in Jersey.  I put a reward on the camera, though.  And I told the both people I spoke to, there's a reward and I told them the reward was 300  bucks.  Ooh, righteous bucks.  Yeah, it's a decent amount for it. 
[00:11:00]  Certainly is.  And this would motivate somebody just because, and I think because I call within a couple  hours, they know you have the medallion number.  It's just not worth it for that someone to try to, or maybe he's just a really honest  guy, but he'll drop it off today.  Probably put a bomb in it.  You know, those people.  Yeah, I'm going to go to the airport with it and fucking pictures of jihadists on my  camera.  It's fucking, it's such a nice picture of fucking, uh, who is bin Laden's second in command?  It'd be funny if it had a name instead of asking for help. 
[00:11:30]  Well, so hopefully I'll have the counter back today.  If not today, then when I return from LA.  If I, if I drove a cab, I think I'd be looking in the backseat every time someone gets out.  Yeah.  And if there's a wallet there, I'm taking the cash.  Fuck it.  I check every, everything when I get out of a cab.  We all do, but every once in a while you fuck up.  I was doing an interview.  I was talking to Adrian, because she's doing that New Yorker article on Patrice.  So we, I had just, I didn't have time.  So I told me to talk right now.  I'm home from therapy.  So I was on the phone in the middle of discussing something. 
[00:12:00]  Just didn't.  You can't be perfect, Dan.  No, I, I have to check.  I check every time because I have to check because there's one thing I never, ever want  to drop in a cab.  So I, the N-bomb.  And when, yeah, I know that'll drop.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  So, so yeah, yeah.  I kind of pat my side.  I go, all right.  And it's a reflex.  It's not even that I have to think about it.  And when I get out, I tap my side and go, all right, I'm good there.  And then that just makes me remember, all right, wallet, phone.  Right.  And then I shut the fucking door. 
[00:12:30]  But I'll always look at the back seat.  It's one of those things where it constantly reminds you.  Three or four days ago, I took a cab home.  Keys in the back seat.  Ooh, that's good.  I hand them over to the driver and I'm like, wow, this person's just fucked.  Ooh.  Because they're not, most people aren't smart enough to do what Jimmy did.  Because I don't even take, you need to take a receipt.  Yeah.  I don't take receipts.  So if I leave something in the cab, I'm fucked.  You can make a phone call.  It was yellow.  It was yellow, I swear.  The guy in it had a beard in a turban.  That's really smart, though. 
[00:13:00]  If you have a receipt, you can at least narrow it down to what cab you were in.  Before I went to lunch, I said, let me fuck it.  I went back up to my apartment.  I mean, I really didn't have it.  Oh, you're so lucky, man.  And I just looked for the two receipts.  Like one, because Kenny drove me home from here after work.  So I checked my going to therapy and coming back from therapy cabs.  And maybe the guy's just a really honest man, too.  A lot of these times, the cabbies are actually honest.  They return shit.  Yeah, you've got to bust apart those stereotypes.  I don't think it's an honest thing.  I think they could get caught. 
[00:13:30]  Maybe, yeah.  And they don't want to deal with it and have to explain, look, I'm telling you it wasn't in the cab.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, especially if somebody turned it in.  Right.  I think somebody probably handed it to them who got it.  Oh, somebody.  That's my impression of the person who got in the cab after me, assuming they're an old lady.  But you just don't need to have it.  And the reward was good money.  You're lucky.  That means someone got in after you, absolutely, and saw the camera and handed it to the driver.  Because most people would just take it in and just go about their day.  But I'm honest.  You think most people are honest?  I always wonder about that.  I don't know, man.  It depends on. 
[00:14:00]  I think there's stages of honesty.  I think if there's a wallet and you're not making that much money in your life and all of a sudden there's $100 in there.  I think most people are taking the $100.  Sorry.  And then maybe handing over the wallet.  Turn back all the pain in the ass fucking shit that's in the wallet to replace.  Right.  But yeah, you know what?  You do kind of hear a lot of stories about people returning shit.  Yeah.  Then again, you don't hear the ones where they don't return it.  Yeah.  I wonder.  I don't know.  You like to think most people are honest?  Yeah, I think most people fucking just take it. 
[00:14:30]  I think so, too.  If there's one phase of the whole thing where it's work.  Yeah.  Where you have to do something to return it.  You won't return it.  Right.  If the guy walks right up to you and goes, do you have this?  Right.  I dropped it.  Then you might return it.  I feel good when I'm walking the sidewalk and a lady drops a scarf or a mitten or something.  Yeah.  I go, excuse me.  You dropped something.  You dropped something.  And then she doesn't turn it around.  I feel good.  I go, okay, bleed to death.  That old gang. 
[00:15:00]  I feel good, though.  Yeah.  That I was able to point it out that she dropped a mitten or a scarf.  But if she's dropping a purse or a wallet, am I saying, excuse me, you dropped something?  Yeah.  It depends on what it is, I think.  Money, like cash, I'd always take and not give back.  You know?  That was just something growing up.  Oh, did I used to...  Finders keepers?  Did I used to love it?  Yeah, because growing up, you know, with my horrible acne problems, I used to walk around 
[00:15:30]  with my head down.  Yeah.  So I'd walk around like, well, with my head down.  Oh, you found a lot of money.  I found a lot of money.  I'd walk around like...  You found a lot of money.  Yeah.  We'd go to like Straw Hat Pizza Palace out there in California when I was a kid.  Yeah.  And I'd be like, ooh, look, a ten.  Yeah.  A tenner.  And yeah, pick that up.  When you find a wallet, I feel like, God, this person is lucky that I was the one that  found the wallet.  Yeah.  And then I'd take the money out of it and return the wallet.  Yeah.  Other people would take the money and throw it in the garbage. 
[00:16:00]  Now, that's rude.  Right.  I would take the money usually and then just say, hey, there's a wallet here to the closest  person that would have to hold on to the wallet.  Fucking hot dog cart vendor guy.  I don't think people like when we're honest.  No.  Because they have to look within themselves.  I really think most people take money.  Take the money.  I think they take the money.  Yeah.  Anyway.  So nothing happened last night besides.  That was a big one.  But aside from that, no. 
[00:16:30]  That's my knowledge.  The feeling of relief you must have had.  I couldn't believe when she called me back.  Holy shit.  That's lucky.  In New York, that's lucky, I think.  Yeah.  So I'm leaving today for Tempe.  No.  I know.  I know.  But I may be.  I may miss the guy.  He may have tried to drop it off.  But I'm so happy I got a lucky guy.  Yeah.  I mean, an honest guy.  You know?  But I'm honest.  I would return something always.  Always.  Oh, I just can't keep stuff.  You're such a good egg.  Nah, this is something really weird.  You are.  You're right.  But no, this is something about keeping somebody's shit that I can't do. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah?  Nah, man.  I did it when I was young.  I stole the drink, but.  Oh.  Oh, and my sister's going to have a baby.  What?  Your sister's having a baby?  I'm going to have another.  Oh, Jimmy.  Uncle Jimmy.  Huh?  Yeah?  When?  August.  Wow.  I don't know if I was supposed to say that on the air, but.  Whoops.  I don't know if that would be a secret.  Why would it be?  Why would it be?  Well, because women like to wait a certain amount of time in case, you know.  I'm sorry if it's supposed to.  They're supposed to wait six to eight weeks, I think.  Oh, yeah.  More than that. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Oh, then that.  Then congratulations.  Oh, well, congrats.  Well, congratulations.  That's pretty cool.  A little tater tot.  Why do you have a weird look out of your face?  Because you're just congratulating me, and I'm just thinking I got nothing to do with  this.  Yeah, that's true.  What am I doing?  Bang your sister.  I liked becoming an uncle.  I kind of liked it.  It'll be my second time.  Big gap between my nephew and.  Yeah.  If she has a niece or a nephew.  Right.  I don't know if I want a nephew, another nephew or a niece.  Probably another nephew.  But that's all you guys got in your family, right?  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Is one nephew?  Believe me, every load for me is a waste.  And for everyone I drop out is fucking on the back of somebody who's collecting money.  We're getting to the point.  There's so many that I got to think who's who.  Nephews and nieces?  I'm almost to the point where I'm like, okay, wait a minute.  How many do you have?  I think we're up to 12.  Wow.  Including mine.  And you're white.  I think we're 12 in already.  This is great.  This prevents me from having to do it now.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Because with my nephew, Nick is 17, so it's like we go to UFC stuff.  But I don't, you know, it's like I'm 43 now.  I'm like, do I have a kid or do I?  You're getting close to being a great uncle.  Yeah.  It's within range now.  Oh, please.  One of my fucking pictures with Brock, Dana White.  I fucking rule.  But one of, no, I mean like if he has a kid.  Oh, great.  I think we're going to that.  Fantastic.  I really am dumb.  Jesus.  I got a nephew who's, what is he up to now, 23, I think. 
[00:19:00]  So I could be a fucking great uncle any day now.  Wow.  23.  That could happen now.  That's crazy.  But the Norton name will not carry on, will it?  Why should it?  Yeah, really.  Let's be honest.  Has it exactly taken the world by storm?  Why should it?  What has the Norton name done?  The Norton name.  You have a responsibility there, sir.  Since the cavemen, there's been a Norton, and all of a sudden that stops now. 
[00:19:30]  That's all right.  A male child of a male, you know.  Wait, are there other Nortons, though?  Like, does your father have brothers?  Yeah.  Oh, so the Norton name goes on.  No, but they're half brothers.  It's a different way.  My dad's family is half brothers and sisters.  Yeah, half brothers and sisters.  So they're all quail.  They're all quails.  Oh.  It's Norton.  He's Norton.  But he's got a...  He might have a sister.  I don't remember.  My brother had a daughter, and my sister had a son.  So that screws the thing up. 
[00:20:00]  The Kumian name.  I'm not.  The Kumian name.  Just withering away.  My father was an only child.  So it's just done.  But it's been around forever.  Yeah, whatever.  Let it die.  Yeah, it's gone.  Let the name die.  After me, what are you going to do?  What the fuck are you going to do?  The greatest one.  Just let that line go.  I feel bad, though.  I'm sure this is not the way they would have wanted to end the name.  Whenever the Norton name started in Ireland, I know my grandmother was very proud of the 
[00:20:30]  fact that we were related to the Pierces, who brought ice cream to Jersey City, I believe.  Oh, wow.  Maybe they just sold it.  She probably exaggerated and lied.  I want to check out what my ancestors did, I think.  I'm curious, too.  I want to know if there's one other guy that did anything.  I did a lot.  Who else did something in this fucking family?  My great-grandfather was born a slave and died a businessman. 
[00:21:00]  Is that true?  No.  It's from the commercial.  It's from the commercial.  Oh, the dumb commercial.  That guy was like, I knew being African-American where this could take me.  And I found out my great-grandfather was born a slave.  And he's like, oh, he goes, born a slave.  Like, oh, that figures.  Of course he knew that.  And then he goes, but dad a business man.  He holds his picture up like, yeah.  Yeah.  My grandfather was born just the opposite.  That's the depressing part.  He sold pot. 
[00:21:30]  That's great.  Dad a business man.  He's like selling weed.  I think all those ancestry sites are all bullshit.  Bunch of malarkey.  Because it's bad for business if all of a sudden you go to him and go, all right, what's my grandfather all about?  Yeah.  Well, he was a slave and died a slave.  Yeah.  No one wants to hear that shit.  No.  So you got to have like, oh.  And then they have some vague, like you're sort of related to the Queen of England's half-brother. 
[00:22:00]  There's always this weird thing that every person is related to someone that was pretty huge in history.  What's that about?  That's bullshit.  Well, the other commercial pulls that off, too.  It shows like, you know, not everybody's great.  This one guy goes, and I found out my great-grandfather lived next door to the Wright brothers.  And that's his big claim to fame.  And at the end of the commercial, he's standing there all proud and happy with a picture of the Wright brothers in the Wright flyer.  And it's like, you can picture what they're, like, he's all proud of that. 
[00:22:30]  And his great-grandparents were probably like, what are you building there?  What do you got over?  What are you building?  It's an airplane.  What an airplane?  What is it?  Just annoying neighbors.  They're complaining.  Turn it off.  It's loud.  It's too loud.  Oh, they probably hated living next door to the Wright brothers.  I bet you the Wright brothers hated them.  Yeah, you probably hated them.  And this guy's all proud of it.  Well, now, because it worked out, he's like, oh, look at me.  Look a little deeper.  They were the ones that fucking probably had an injunction against them. 
[00:23:00]  They can't run the motors between fucking 8 o'clock and fucking 8 at night.  Or his grandmother's the first woman to ever be DP'd on the wing of an airplane.  DP'd.  So they're even going with neighbors of famous people?  I know.  Because if you go to one of these companies and they don't find something cool, you're  going to be like, fuck you and you fuck your company.  Here's your historic line.  Well, look, you got nothing.  You got a bunch of blue collar people that just had kids that died. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  And had more kids.  Right.  Yeah.  So there's some shenanigans going on there.  They got to find somebody of importance for every single person.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  I think so.  That's my thought.  Yeah.  Debating trying it.  Business man.  I actually did.  I went to Ancestry.com and I fucking put my name.  You got to know a lot.  The more you know about your family and names and marriages and kids, the better off you  are because you give them more information to work off of.  Don't you have to know social security numbers of old people? 
[00:24:00]  No.  You can just know a last name and hope for the best, you know?  So I knew a few things about maiden names of my grandparents and shit like that.  I don't know that shit.  And children.  And then the more you know, it links up with other people that are kind of connected to  your family, maybe a marriage or something like that.  And their tree kind of goes into yours.  Right.  And like they say, a little leaf pops up.  You click on it and there's like a death certificate or some kind of a census from 1908. 
[00:24:30]  And it's got like your grandmother's name on it as a kid.  And I'll check that shit out.  It's it's it's it's not easy.  It's you know, you got to work at it.  You're not going to check that shit out.  I only check out easy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, if you got a little time, it's pretty interesting.  Kevin from Connecticut.  What about all the way May?  All the way May.  Come on now.  You'd like to see what she was up to.  Well, no kids, but fucking like a banshee.  That was Bill Burr's angle. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bill Burr really got on.  She was a great baseball player in a time when women didn't play baseball.  That was she was one of the fucking chicks from that movie.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was the name of the movie?  I care so much.  I forgot the name of the movie.  The League of Their Own.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a true story.  All the way May was related to Opie.  Yes.  And she fucked like an animal.  Oh, did we have a good time talking about all the way May.  Well, let's slow down a little.  Fucking having every hole filled. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  We were doing the first base, second base, third base home run analogies.  Oh, there was no, no letting go of all the way May.  I tried to share something nice.  Yeah.  And look what happened.  Look what happened.  So Jimmy's going to be an uncle again.  Yeah.  That's pretty good news right there.  I think my family, we're just about done with that.  I think I might squeeze one more, maybe two.  I don't know.  I got to get going, I think.  But besides that, I think we're done as a family, as far as that next generation. 
[00:26:00]  I think we're set at this point.  This takes care of my obligation.  What did you do?  Nothing.  I'm saying, but meaning that now there's another Norton child.  No, no, no.  I mean this, but now I don't have to have one.  Like, there's another kid.  Instead of me and my sister each having one, let her have two.  Yeah.  Why should I be, you know, inconvenienced?  Maybe your mom will have one more.  Okay.  Imagine if my mom was knocked up and my father's like, it's not mine. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, God.  That would be awful.  I remember years ago, I believe, when my mom was in her mid-40s or something like that,  her and Sal came up and were like, oh, there's a problem here.  Your mom's pregnant.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  How old was your mom?  I knocked her up.  I knocked up your mom.  She was like 45 or something.  Did you want to punch Sal in the face for knocking up your mom?  Great.  First of all, I don't even want to think about it. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  And then just thinking of like this poor kid in this rusty old plumbing.  Right.  Having to fucking deal with that, you know?  A womb that's like a, yeah, yeah.  Probably like one of those dried out wine satchels at a concert.  Devoid of wine.  45 is what?  25 years ago, about?  A little more, maybe?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a while ago.  Probably like almost 30 years ago.  Almost 30 years ago.  Okay.  And it's like, oh, yeah, there's a, you know, we have a, your mom is a. 
[00:27:30]  And then they said they thought about it.  But, oh, my God.  They didn't think about it, huh?  Yeah, my brother got one for his girl.  We got to go get you one of those abortions.  Your mom had an abortion.  So she had to have an abortion at 45.  Like a piece of fucking shit.  Oh, my God.  She had to be in the waiting room with 16-year-olds?  Yeah, yeah.  Chewing gum and fucking, what are you here for?  Your daughter getting an abortion?  No, go scratch your ass. 
[00:28:00]  I got to get scraped.  She's got to have a vacuum in there and suck out some fucking, some little brother or sister of mine.  Some half-brother sister.  Oh, my God.  Wonderful.  She's reading teen magazines in the waiting room.  Yeah, yeah.  Waiting her turn.  You know, having to talk to some nurse that's fucking 20 years younger than her saying,  you know, you should use some type of protection maybe next time.  Abortion is not a good means of birth control. 
[00:28:30]  Shut up.  I have kids older than you.  Get away from me.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Why are you telling people this?  Because who cares at this point?  Ro, you're pregnant.  I knocked her up.  My sperm's still good.  And, yeah, they had an abortion.  And at the same time, she got a tubal ligation.  What the hell does that mean?  Well, they tied the tube so she couldn't have any more kids.  Oh.  So they could go on doing some of that, you know, fucking, without, uh...  I guess Sal likes it raw, huh? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  I go bareback, Ro.  Sal likes going raw.  I go bareback.  You could either take it in the ass or get a tubal ligation, Ro.  Oh, it was just...  But when they had a...  And all I'm thinking, me and my brother is like, why the fuck are they telling us?  Yeah, there's no reason.  Do it behind everyone's back if you're not going to fucking have a kid. 
[00:29:30]  Why the hell do I have to know that you got her pregnant?  I got to ask my mom, because I remember as a kid, like, her being on the phone with my dad crying a lot.  A lot?  And I...  Did her hiney hurt?  And I remember, like, thinking that, uh-oh, she might be pregnant.  Wow.  And how old was she at the time you were thinking, though?  Probably...  Same thing, yeah?  More or less.  Forties?  Forty, early forties. 
[00:30:00]  But I don't know, but just hearing what you just said brought back a memory to me.  I remember, very vividly, she was...  There was obviously a problem.  Oh, God.  And then, uh, I don't know.  Nothing ever came of it that I know of.  My boys are swimming, Ro!  Because we were Catholics growing up.  Hey, man, you weren't allowed to use protection.  Old school.  Nah, you had to use the rhythm method.  You had to try to figure out fucking numbers.  What's the rhythm method, anyway?  What, do you got to keep track of the calendar when you're ovulating?  Rhythm method doesn't work if you had a few pops in you. 
[00:30:30]  And the rhythm method sounds stupid, because it sounds like it's the rhythm of your dick  going in and out, and you get mistaken, because that's what makes you cum.  The rhythm method makes you cum inside.  Our parents had pie charts.  Yeah, yeah, there was something going on.  With parts of the pie chart which were shaded in, as in, okay, when we're in these days,  we're good.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  Woody Allen had a funny line about the rhythm method.  He said to someone in his family, he was going, like, you know, my cousin, she's practicing 
[00:31:00]  the rhythm method, and apparently she can't keep a beat, because, like, they're kids.  Woody Allen's great.  Fucking great.  Man, yeah, so that was, I don't know how we got on that, but.  That's very funny.  Because the Ancestry thing.  Oh, yeah, Ancestry.  The Ancestry.com thing.  Yeah.  That'd be cool to check out.  Yeah, and then, I don't know, I guess one of my relatives sent for a cumia coat of arms 
[00:31:30]  to see, you know, the history of the name.  Yeah.  And they couldn't really find a coat of arms, so they came up with some generic one.  Oh, this is yours.  And I said they realized there was some town in somewhere, Sicily, I guess.  Oh, no.  It was probably overrun by the Moors first.  They did so much fucking.  Yeah.  My great-great-grandfather probably was born a slave and died a businessman.  Oh, man.  It was the first place in fucking Sicily to serve, like, Old English.  Yeah, Odie.  Odie.  So they had to make a coat of arms. 
[00:32:00]  Who wants a coat of arms?  Well, yeah, I know.  When did you use them?  Were they popular when you had pick up swords?  Well, yeah, you put them on your shield, and, you know, it was your family crest.  It was like your email address or something.  Was it your email address at the time?  Your unique email?  That was your at.  It was your at.  Right there.  Yeah.  Oh, the Roberts.  Look at the Roberts coat of arms.  There's always a lion and a sword and a shield and a helmet.  It's always very brave-looking.  Stop.  Yeah.  The Nortons is a pair of pants with a snake just hanging sadly out of it. 
[00:32:30]  If you've got a cool...  All coat of arms are pretty cool.  There's a knight on them.  Why is there a knight with a bird on its head for Norton?  It's a bird brain.  There is.  There's a knight with a bird sitting on his head.  It's probably a knight in Norton.  That means that's not a good knight.  That's stupid.  That's a bad knight.  Why would you shoo him away? 
[00:33:00]  He's too stupid to shoo him away.  Maybe he's busy.  That is bird brain.  A Chipperson always stands still.  That's not Chipperson.  Is there a Chipperson family crest?  I'd like to see that.  Or how about a family aim or a family aqua fresh?  Let's see the Chipperson one.  Hey, wait a minute.  There's a bird on his head, too.  What's up with the birds?  It's a bird brain.  Why don't you go with Hughes?  I want to see Hughes.  All right.  The Hughes one has got to be...  Yeah.  Let's do the Hughes.  That's...  Very popular name.  Very popular coat of arms.  It's a knight in a straitjacket. 
[00:33:30]  It probably is.  Oh, you've got three lions on the shield and a knight's helmet.  Very mysterious.  Yes.  It's like the leaves around you.  Very mysterious.  Flowers.  Probably poison ivy.  What's the nagel?  Let's look for the nagel crest.  It's funny.  Oh, boy.  It's a giant testicle with a little lump on the side of it.  It's a guy trying to squeeze into his armor. 
[00:34:00]  It's a knight looking at his fucking armor that won't fit with his shrugging shoulders.  Or it's a scale with a tear in his face.  That's a nagel.  That's horrible.  Terrible.  What is that?  It's, again, just a cross, a blue cross on a silver shield with a knight's helmet.  Right there.  What about Kenny?  It looks goofy.  What about Cuff said to Kenny?  I'll write down his last name. 
[00:34:30]  Yes, we don't like putting his last name out to everybody.  Because of the charges.  Some people know it, but, you know, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  Who is that?  Oh, yeah, that's his coat of arms.  What is it?  It looks like three dicks.  It's like three cocks on the fucking shield.  He's got three mushroom heads.  Facing down mushroom heads.  He's got mushroom heads.  That's, well, our unique codes of arms.  Frank and Jersey, very confused.  Frank and Jersey.  Oh, don't you have, like, nine brothers and sisters? 
[00:35:00]  Someone didn't do the pie charts right.  That's what I'm getting at.  My mom had, I think, seven kids, six berfs.  Berf.  And openly told us her entire life she didn't want all these kids.  Oh, that's lovely to hear, right?  It didn't bother me.  I was the first out.  So I'm like, well, obviously she wanted me.  You're the oldest.  As far as that situation goes, yeah, my dad was married.  Right.  My dad was married before my mom to his high school sweetheart who tragically died at 26 of kidney failure. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, Jesus.  So you're the first of Part Deux.  Part Deux.  You're the sequel.  So I have a half-sister that my wife gets really mad at because I don't acknowledge that she was part of our family.  But she left really early.  Yeah.  So when people say how many kids you got, I go six.  Oh, wait.  She had six kids, five berths.  That's what it was.  Do you see her half-sister?  No, I love her.  It's more of a joke.  She's in Florida. 
[00:36:00]  She actually listens every day.  Oh, hi.  Somewhere along the way, she decided to become an uber fan of our show.  Really?  Yeah.  That's pretty nice.  She's quiet, though.  She won't.  She'll never fucking call or write or anything.  I don't know who listens in my family.  I never want to know.  Hey, I really am.  It's good.  It's good.  I don't want to know.  You know, I heard the other day.  It's good.  It's good.  Joy, joy, joy, joy.  Yeah, I don't know.  I got so many cousins out there on Long Island.  I don't know who listens.  No idea. 
[00:36:30]  No clue.  I got a few.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was more so when we were on the regular radio because it was easier that way.  But, you know, there's a few out there.  Yeah, the satellite, which most people still don't have.  It makes it tough for our families to listen to us.  Satellite.  Yeah.  It's just kind of a good thing.  I know.  The parents stopped listening a while ago.  Why?  It just got too crazy for them.  Just too much?  They reached an age where it was like they couldn't keep up anymore?  They couldn't keep up.  They couldn't listen.  You know, we start rambling on, especially about tech talk and just some popular culture 
[00:37:00]  things, things in the news.  It's like maybe if we talk about Benny Goodman.  Right.  They'd get it.  But, yeah, they've reached that point.  You know, I don't think I don't think mom's in danger of getting knocked up anymore.  Be quite honest with you.  Jesus.  Are they still having sex, you think?  Probably not.  Really?  Yeah, they'd probably reach that age where it's just, you know, Lucy and Desi beds.  What about Sal, though?  What about him?  That rod's getting fucking...  That rod's getting hard anymore.  That rod's getting hard anymore.  That rod's getting hard anymore.  That rod's getting hard anymore.  Oh, my God. 
[00:37:30]  They'd probably just watch each other masturbate.  I don't know.  To them, it's like Entenmann's cake would be a sex.  Yeah.  Getting a nice piece of Entenmann's.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  Talk to people in these assisted living places and they're fucking still horny.  It's called rape.  They're still horny, though.  They're raping the old people in the assisted living.  I believe the guy's more than the women.  Yeah.  But they're still fucking horny.  There's a few.  Yeah, like, you know, you talk to Brewer about his dad and that's pretty much what it is. 
[00:38:00]  You know, the horny old guy.  Right.  But, I don't know, some guys just give up.  Yeah.  I think Sal's had so many procedures on his fucking schlong and, you know, they've snaked  so much shit up that urinary tract.  It's just like...  It's done some damage.  Pure scar tissue.  Right.  It's like he's got a pipe cleaner up there.  It's constantly...  You can just twist it and turn it.  It's constantly hard, but it's all just scar tissue.  Yeah, whatever it is.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And, you know, mom doesn't look like she wants any part of that anymore, so... 
[00:38:30]  Are they happy?  I don't know.  They're probably miserable.  Why?  I don't know, because they're old.  They always seem pretty happy.  Yeah, but they reach that point where they're just old now.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  You know.  I was watching some shit the other day.  Fucking...  Oh, oh.  So, Ann was at the house, and she had on ABC, and I just got done working out.  And I sit down on the couch, and General Hospital comes on.  I have not seen General Hospital in decods. 
[00:39:00]  It's been many years.  And then you watch.  It's like, holy shit, the same people are on this show.  Really?  But, the guys that were the young, groovy fucking guys that were in the...  With the chicks and the action sequences in the show, they're now the old people that  the young action guys go up to to get, like, the matronly advice from.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And you watch and go, fuck, that's...  They're the old guys.  And then you realize, ah, that's happening in real life.  No shit. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Have you looked in a mirror lately?  I have.  Exactly.  That's what I'm talking about.  I fucking have.  That's what I'm talking about.  You see your nieces and nephews, they're getting older, they're becoming the younger  people, like real people, not kids anymore, that are at the family gatherings.  The aunts and uncles that I remember are now the old people that the grandparents were.  Right.  And you're in that mid-range where you're like what they were when you were a kid.  Way to explain the cycle of life to everybody.  It is.  I got nieces, they're ready to sprout. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  They're ready to pop.  They're ready to pop.  But I'm thinking, I know you as a little fucking kid with your dumb dolls.  It's like, oh, look at your tits.  What happened there?  Hey.  Whoa, two more tits.  They're ready to sprout.  Yeah.  They're right on the verge.  I got a nephew.  I think a whisker or two is about to pop out.  Oh, boy.  And I remember it's just a tiny little fucking kid on one of those dumb electric cars that  go a half mile an hour.  Oh, they grow so fast. 
[00:40:30]  I can't believe Anthony Geary is still playing Luke Spencer.  He's like 80 years old.  I thought those soap operas went away, though.  Well, General Hospital is one that's kind of hanging in there.  Wait, Luke is still on TV?  Luke Spencer.  As in Luke and Laura?  Yes.  Is still on General Hospital.  But again, he's like, but he's trying.  He's got the earring and he's got the wild hair.  But he's still trying to.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  Has he always been on General Hospital as Luke?  No, I think he took some time off, went to another soap. 
[00:41:00]  But how much time off?  Yeah.  I'm just screaming.  I don't know.  That's 30 years ago, that wedding.  How old is Luke?  Yeah, yeah.  That was him with his fucking curly top hair.  Now he's just got spiky gray hair.  Wasn't that still one of the biggest shows?  Was that their wedding, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a huge one.  He's married to Tracy Quartermain now.  I don't know who that is.  Who was another one that was, you know, around for a while.  Is Laura still on the show?  No.  Jeannie Francis?  I don't think so.  I used to watch it when I was completely out of work and a bum living at friends' houses 
[00:41:30]  in like 83, 84.  What year was the wedding?  80.  It was.  81.  Why do people care so much?  Because there was really nothing else to do.  There was no social fucking media.  Well, especially daytime TV really sucked.  You forget.  When we were growing up, daytime TV was awful.  It was game shows or soaps.  That was it.  That's all you had.  It's still awful, by the way.  It's still terrible, but there's a lot more of a choice.  I had Joe from Sights and Sounds over yesterday, who's a great guy, takes care of my house, 
[00:42:00]  my audio visual needs.  Yeah.  And he was tinkering yesterday, so we had to keep the TV on, and I was watching Who Wants  to Be a Millionaire with Meredith Vieira.  Holy fuck, is that awful.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  And then it went to some cooking show with the Italian guy.  Yeah.  Help me out.  He has the ponytail, he's, uh...  Yeah, it's kind of...  It's called The Chew or something? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, Jesus.  This fucking...  Ben Stein's gonna call.  That's terrible.  I don't know.  It's not even...  What are they making?  Cool.  I don't know, but the point is, it was just horrible TV.  Horrible.  Yeah, that show.  What's it called?  The Chew?  Yeah.  The Chew.  And they were trying, like, Tabasco's, because now Tabasco has, like, ten products now.  Oh, right.  And then they thought they were funny, so they were doing a bit where they're in a Spanish  soap opera. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, I love those.  You know, that over-the-top acting, where everyone's having sex with everyone else.  I'm sitting there going, this is God fucking awful.  Just terrible.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's some real shite on.  And I just can't, I still get more and more annoyed at that true TV.  Yeah.  I was watching, because now there are shows, and when I get tweeted from people that say,  boy, you gotta check this out, it's hilarious. 
[00:43:30]  No, it's fake.  Every single one of their shows are phony.  And I was watching a bait car the other day, and this is supposedly some cops, and they put  cameras in a car, and the car is rigged to where you can lock it, cut the engine, make  the window so they don't roll down, and they get these always brothers that hop into the  car, and they're like, yeah, motherfucker, and they start driving it off.  And then they shut the car down and lock the doors, go up to the window. 
[00:44:00]  God, get your fucking hands up.  Get your hands up.  And it's entertaining.  Until you realize, like, they intercut bullshit scenes of cops, like, tracking them with this  beep, beep, beep thing on a map, and these helicopter shots that aren't real, and just,  it's fake.  Fakery.  Just do the show.  And what do they do?  They leave the keys in the car or something?  Yeah, they put the keys, like, either on top of the car, like someone's a god.  You know what?  I would assume that the type of person that is stealing cars knows all that. 
[00:44:30]  Probably.  I don't think they're professional car thieves.  They're getting people that are, like, caught up in the moment and go like, oh, I'm going  to take that.  I don't think some of the footage is, no, I don't think some of the footage is fake.  I think some of it's real.  Okay.  But everything they build around it is fake.  Like, the whole setup and everything, the people in the car, the ones going, I think he's  moving eastbound on blah-de-blah.  That, I think, is completely fake.  All right, so they're just trying to up their production value.  Yeah, which is, you know, just do it like cops. 
[00:45:00]  Who cares?  Like, look, see, this guy's getting in the car.  But you really think these guys are stealing cars?  Because you would have to wait around a while.  That's the part where the jury's still out with me.  I'm not sure.  I don't think they're that good of actors to, because they come off as really scared  and pissed that they got caught in.  But I think if you put, I think if you have keys on top of the car, above the driver, the  door, whatever, where you get in your car, I should have said, I think it would take a  really fucking long time before someone actually goes for it. 
[00:45:30]  They're not parking it in front of your building or in front of my house.  They're parking these things in places where you're not going to get a professional car  thief that's going to look and go, yeah, this is a great opportunity.  You're getting dumb kids that see the keys and go, oh, man.  And then they scope out the scene.  They're looking around.  And then they take it.  I would like to talk to those guys.  I think even in that situation where they parked the cars, I think it takes a while.  I really do.  I think it's fake.  What?  I think the show is fake. 
[00:46:00]  But you just said they're real.  But I'm not sure how much of it's real and how much of it's fake.  I don't know.  Any of these towing shows are not only horrible, but so fake.  And when I get people telling me, you've got to watch it, it's great.  This guy fucking took this bitch and pushed her down.  Shut up.  Fake, fakeity, fake, fake.  Yeah.  Well, I say we eat or something.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Oh, by the way, Jon Stewart had a really funny bit last night.  We can go to break with this. 
[00:46:30]  State of the Union, Obama.  He, as Jon Stewart said, he opened with telling everybody that he basically killed Osama bin Laden.  That's a big opener.  And Jon Stewart had a good angle on that whole thing.  I didn't give it away too much, did I?  No.  By the way, when we come back, can we talk about Oscar de la Hoya?  Uh-oh.  And that broad, uh...  Seeing Dutch again.  Who are you mad at?  Just...  The broad?  Yeah.  Of course you are.  And we've got to talk about the guy from Fox News.  Oh, God. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Good day, New York.  Yeah.  I...  I...  I think he's innocent.  Do you?  Yeah.  I do, too.  I haven't read the...  Yeah.  Read.  I'll catch up.  Oh, we'll go over it.  Read.  Read during the break.  Oh, let's see.  Because that's on the front page.  But first this.  For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country.  You open with, I killed bin Laden? 
[00:47:30]  Did you open with that?  Hey, everybody, how you doing?  You having a nice night?  I killed bin Laden!  I killed him!  What are you doing?  Does Rick Springfield open with Jessie's Girl?  No!  He opens with, I've done everything for you.  And then he transitions it and goes off to Strangers, slows it down a bit with Affair of  the Heart, and then hits you with something off the new album.  And then just when you think he can't get any more beautiful, Jessie's Girl! 
[00:48:00]  And the place goes nuts!  It goes nuts!  This is the O.P. and Anthony show, show, show. 
[00:48:30]  Correct!  This version is this.  Are we getting topical?  My tribute to Eric.  Yeah, because G-Rock is not here today.  Aw, shit!  We're getting topical with Travis today.  What?  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  Oh. 
[00:49:00]  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  I got this one already.  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay!  I tried to think like Eric would think.  Oh, boy.  No, no, no.  Are you hungry?  That's a compliment.  First time doing Getting Topical and he nailed it.  Nailed it.  Dr. Gay.  He fucking nailed it.  This is how it's played.  Exactly.  I'm going to cut this for Eric and I'm going to send it to him.  As an example.  I'm going to say this is how you do it.  How to do it correctly.  Say whip it!  Whip it!  I am so in on this one.  Who's doing this version of Whip it?  It's some kid's version.  I figured this was a Eric. 
[00:49:30]  I said whip it!  No, I know.  I know it has nothing to do with what.  Whip it good!  You just wanted a different version of the song.  This is all about Demi Moore.  I have no doubt in my mind.  Right.  What a great.  What a great.  And it's topical.  That is topical.  Perfect.  Thanks, guys.  Whip it.  Whip it.  Whip it.  Whip it.  Whip it.  Whip it.  This was perfect.  This was an example of how this is supposed to be done.  Really well done.  It really has nothing to do with the band. 
[00:50:00]  No.  It's a twist on the words of the song.  You know the song.  It's topical.  It's topical.  Again.  Man.  You nailed it, Dr. Gay.  Well, does this mean we can just stop using that name?  What, Travis?  We did.  We stopped using Travis.  It's Dr. Gay.  Everyone knows that.  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay.  Well, the story goes, Demi Moore reportedly had a seizure after doing a lot of whippets.  What the fuck?  It's just really odd. 
[00:50:30]  Like, what the fuck is she doing with whippets?  Because her husband's fucking young tens.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  She's out of her mind.  Imagine seeing somebody you dated or were married to.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, they're banging people in their age group who are fucking hot.  Yeah.  But the story goes, Ashton Kutcher is playing it both ways, though.  He's, like, getting slightly jealous when Demi Moore kind of does her thing.  Because they're at a lot of events together.  And then he goes off after being a little jealous.  And then he's at the bar trying to pick up a 10.  Ah. 
[00:51:00]  So he's a pussy.  He's got to, like, just, look, if that's what you want to do, then go.  Gotcha.  Just fucking go.  I wonder if he's talking about this stuff on Twitter.  No, that's right.  No, no.  Anyone who follows him, he's just.  No, he couldn't handle his own Twitter, remember?  Guys, could you do it for me?  He couldn't handle his own Twitter.  It's too much.  A plus K.  I'm going to lose my sponsorships.  But there's a good article in the paper.  Like, when he's feeling, like, weakness, he goes back to Demi.  Yeah.  Not goes back back.  Demi.  But just enough to make her think, oh, fuck, maybe we're going to work this out. 
[00:51:30]  And then she gets news, you know, fast forward a day later, he's picking up tens.  I say fucking just move on.  Yeah.  Move on with that shit.  Yeah.  Some people can't.  But then she turns around and what?  She gets a bunch of fucking whipped cream and.  Starts sucking up the gas.  Is she sucking up the gas?  Yeah.  You're 50.  I know.  Whippets are for the young, man.  Why is she just, you know, smoke some weed or something, if you want.  Whippets are silly.  Whippets are silly.  That's dumb.  She had a seizure. 
[00:52:00]  Jeez.  She seized up.  Look at an old lady.  How do you get a seizure from doing whippets?  Because you're 50 doing whippets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There are things you just can't do.  Yeah, man.  And she's.  Ass play and whippets are for the young.  Ass play and whippets.  Are for the young.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she definitely looks like she's got some kind of eating disorder.  At this point, yeah.  Yeah.  Very gaunt.  Very skinny.  Yeah.  Every tendon in her neck.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She don't look happy right there.  I'll tell you that much.  This looks fucking beautiful.  How long ago was that shot?  For an older lady?  Holy fuck.  I don't know.  That's not that long ago.  Try that stand before I kiss you on the neck.  You know what?  You can't say she's ugly.  She's hot, man.  No, no.  That's hot.  That's a hot picture of her right there.  That's followed up with for her age, though.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah, man.  Nah, man.  You see other women at that age, they're not even coming close to looking that.  Well, that's horrible, obviously.  No, I'd give her a bite.  We're looking at a picture right now where she's completely anorexic. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, completely.  Wow.  She couldn't be much thinner than that.  Same picture, same...  Same night.  That's the same photo shoot.  Look at the dress.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yep.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  That face, though.  You know what?  You lose a lot of weight.  It makes your face look good.  It stretches the skin over the skull.  Looks nice.  You got those cheekbones happening again, but the rest of your body looks like shit.  She was doing whippets like a Devo song.  Yeah, that was what the gag was. 
[00:53:30]  We played it.  That was the...  Late to the party on that.  Oh, boy.  So what?  Is she all right?  She's in rehab or something?  Rehab for whippets?  How humiliating.  Yeah.  I fucking hate celebrities.  Yeah, they popped her in the hospital and, you know...  For whippets.  How embarrassing was that?  She's getting some professional help.  What's the matter?  I am addicted to a delicious treat.  Yeah.  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  Yeah, yeah.  You try doing it with Cool Whip.  Just lifting the lid and breathing.  It doesn't quite work. 
[00:54:00]  You need that ready whip.  I have cottage cheese.  I'm gonna give it a shot.  Yeah, go ahead.  But this is good.  This is good for inhaling a small curd.  Fucking curd.  A fucking curd.  A small curd.  Without mandarin oranges, cottage cheese is a complete waste of time.  Oh, mandarin oranges rule.  I also have a...  You put a little of the juice in there with the mandarin oranges.  You got a nice little treat.  It doesn't beat mac and the peaches though.  Those are good.  I like the peaches.  How about banana?  Banana.  What?  You make everything suck. 
[00:54:30]  Why?  Bananas and cottage cheese, when you can have mandarin oranges or a little peach thing  with the syrup?  No, I just like...  Syrup.  Syrup.  Syrup.  I like to do a little spoon.  And then I eat your bagel.  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  I like a little vanilla yogurt with that banana.  You shove a banana in there.  Yep.  Let it drip down the banana and then smack your face with it.  Oh.  Yeah, it's like a pecker.  Hey, exactly, Chip. 
[00:55:00]  Maybe Demi Moore is depressed because she didn't have one daughter that didn't have  that giant fucking shin.  That big Bruce Willis fucking jaw they wound up getting.  Maybe that set her into a fucking frenzy.  Scout and rumor.  They got these...  Is that it?  Look at that fucking jaw.  Oh, man.  Your mom's Demi Moore.  They got the Bruce Willis big fucking jaw.  That looks like a prosthetic, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Looks like she did it for a roll.  Is there any way you could scrape that shit down? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  They get in there with a chisel.  For real?  Yeah.  You think like fucking cosmetic surgery is all gentle and they're like, okay, we'll  make an incision here.  We'll slowly do this and that.  And they take a chisel and they're like bang, bang, bang.  Wow.  It's crazy.  Oh, man.  Look at those jaws on these broads.  Oh, my God.  Your mom's Demi.  She is not attractive.  That daughter.  You know what, though?  Like, you know, put the piece of paper up and get rid of the fucking jaw part and they're 
[00:56:00]  really attractive.  Well, she looks like that actress.  What's her name there?  Yes.  I know exactly.  The sisters.  Becky Sue Tuttle?  No, the one that was in...  Oh, fuck.  Help me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It starts with T.  T, T, T with T.  T, my aunt.  Tilly.  Tilly.  Yes.  Jennifer Tilly.  Jennifer Tilly.  Yeah.  She does look like Jennifer Tilly.  Jennifer Tilly or the other Tilly.  She's a sister?  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  The Tilly's. 
[00:56:30]  Is so goddamn hot.  Meg Tilly?  Is her Meg Tilly?  Oh, right.  Yeah.  She was always sexy, no?  She was.  I think she's fat now.  Is she?  I don't know.  She always fucking drips sexuality.  I get that sister's confused.  Let's see this.  Oh.  She's got some big tits.  Oh, yeah.  There she is looking a little more bruised, but wow.  I'd still go there.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  She had some sexy roles over the years.  Oh, fuck.  She was fucking Michael Madsen while the husband watched her.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good one.  That's one of the greatest sex scenes ever.  Yeah, that was a good one.  And then Michael Madsen laughs at the loser and closes the bathroom door.  Look for Meg.  See what she looks like.  Meg Tilly.  Meg Tilly.  Because that's the other sister.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  That's Meg Tilly in her day.  What movie's that from?  What movie's that from?  Was she in where they go away for the weekend? 
[00:57:30]  Kevin Bacon was the corpse.  The weekend at Bernie's?  No, man.  They all went away for, got back together after many years.  Yeah.  Man, what happened?  The Woodsman.  Oh, the Woodsman.  No, what the fuck was this movie?  I know which one you mean.  The Big Chill?  Yeah.  The Big Chill.  I never saw that.  Was she in The Big Chill?  Meg Tilly's old, huh?  Yeah.  Happens to all of us.  She's older than the sister.  I think she was in The Big Chill.  There you go.  I think that's the only movie I know her from. 
[00:58:00]  I thought it was the same girl.  She's 51.  51?  Yeah.  51.  Got a birthday coming up on Valentine's Day.  Get one of those long-stemmed roses from Steven Singer.  Tipped in gold, you know.  Our pal Armie Hammer was arrested for marijuana possession.  We should be arrested for that name that sounds like baking soda.  Armie Hammer, I know.  I like that.  He's like a newer friend of the show.  Really cool guy.  And it turns out, what, he got arrested in the same place that Snoop and Willa Nelson got arrested? 
[00:58:30]  Smoking weird.  Well, Texas doesn't deal with the pot too well, huh?  No.  And what, he spent a night in jail and he's good now?  Yeah, he got arrested back in November and he spent a night in jail and had to post-  So why is this story coming out today?  A thousand dollars bond.  I don't know.  Maybe it didn't.  Anyone that fucking goes to jail for just some weed.  It's so ridiculous at this point.  Just fucking decriminalize it completely.  It really is dumb. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Ah, pot.  Ooh, look out.  There's so much more damage.  People fucking down in a bottle of Maker's Mark and hopping in their car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Decapitating children driving the wrong way on a fucking expressway.  The bit's been done a million times, but when you're on a lot of pot, you're driving a lot slower.  Yeah.  And it just fucking doesn't make any sense.  And you're not fighting anyone in a bar.  No.  People are very mellow and just want to sleep.  Yeah.  They're working on it.  They'll make it...  Well, they gotta figure out how to monetize it and then they'll certainly make it legal. 
[00:59:30]  Well, you know what?  You don't even have to monetize it at this point.  Well, that's what they're waiting for.  Just the money that would be saved in the criminal justice system by just not fucking prosecuting these people.  Yeah.  And not tying up prison space with people that have some weed.  Mm-hmm.  It's crazy.  Let's get into the Oscar De La Hoya thing.  Oh.  Jimmy is a little mad about this.  Get into his ass.  Right?  Huh?  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  So what happened?  What's going on with this Oscar De La Hoya?  This enchanting young model.  She's calling herself a model now?  Yeah, well, she is.  She's done Playboy.  She's done, like, Maxim.  But she also does some other things it looks like.  I don't know.  Like, she might be one of those girls who you call up, I think he met her online,  who goes over and you have dinner with them.  Like, they had dinner and he was, like, promising her apparently stuff like, you know,  dental work or whatever she needs.  Like, you know, kind of sugar daddy type stuff it seems.  Ah, yeah.  But I don't know if she fucks. 
[01:00:30]  I'm guessing she does, but I don't know.  Yeah.  Who knows?  But she was the one that released all the pictures of him in the fishnets?  No, no, no.  That's all.  That's different.  Different girl.  Different girl.  That was a stripper.  Piece of shit.  This is a new one.  I can't keep track of this, Jimmy.  They went to the Ritz and he had a suite.  This is a new story?  Oh, this is Brenda.  This is Brenda.  Oh, then why the fuck are they showing the old pictures?  I thought they were the connection there.  That's what they do.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  That's right, because she said that he wanted to wear her underwear and she had some sex 
[01:01:00]  toys come.  Oh.  And she wouldn't say what he wanted, but I'm going to guess he wanted things in his ass.  Well.  That's my guess.  Who doesn't, Jim?  Who doesn't?  Yeah, it goes without saying.  If you're alive, you should want that.  Right.  But then I guess she called up a girlfriend to come over and she felt trapped in her room  because she was afraid if she came at Oscar, she would want to have sex again.  It just sounds so fucking annoying.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  One of those nights.  Yeah, she's suing him for five million.  For what?  Oh.  What's the cause?  Intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  She went to the hotel room with them.  Just enraging.  Another case of fucking...  What the fuck is this about?  Just a bitch trying to get some cash.  So it seems like, yeah.  Yeah.  I like putting on women's underwear every so often, those silky ones.  You look funny with the top of your boner sticking out of the top.  I never did.  I did it once in my life.  Look at me.  My boners sticking out over there.  Sam could not turn quick enough to Travis to have them fucking cap that what I just said  about wearing women's panties.  You got to try some of this stuff, Sam. 
[01:02:00]  I mean, I don't know if I'll try.  I know that tomorrow...  You got to look up a little bit.  Tomorrow we'll have a new production, True Confessions from Anthony Cumia.  Nice.  True Confessions.  True Confessions.  True Confessions.  You never threw on a pair of the girls' panties while you're having a little of that sex  play?  No.  And you look all silly and you get a good laugh out of it because your boner's sticking  out over the top of the elastic.  Sam's a puppet eyebrow dud.  Because I don't wear panties.  Exactly.  I think every time Sam comes, he's just ashamed. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  He's at that stage still.  I'm just ashamed.  He just rolls over.  He's just on the end of the bed because when he was growing up, he would do it.  Mother would come in and pat his back and go, Sam, it's okay.  It's okay.  It's natural to have these dreams.  Yes.  Don't look at me.  Yeah.  Oh, we'll take care of the sheets.  We'll wash them.  Don't worry.  It's Hulk Hogan doll in and clean the leg off.  It's Pepsi.  I swear.  Yeah.  Pepsi.  That's my excuse.  That's a dumb excuse.  I wouldn't mind wearing like crotchless stockings or something. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish I was into that with a girl.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's a little much.  It's just perverted.  I think the panties are kind of funny.  They're funny and the silk is kind of nice.  What's bad about having a little silk rubbing on your dick?  It's great.  It's smooth.  It's silky.  It's like silk.  I can't get past the fact that it just is silly.  It's silly.  Oh, believe me.  I'm not doing it like, yeah, this is fucking great.  I like doing this.  And I haven't honestly have not done that in fucking years and years. 
[01:03:30]  But every once in a while, you just grab it.  You're a panty boy.  And throw it on.  I don't think I'm panty boy.  I don't think I'm panty boy.  You know, I always keep them laughing.  Just a visual.  Panty boy.  What else do we have on Oscar De La Hoya?  So that's it.  What else do we have in Oscar De La Hoya?  A $5 million lawsuit.  Because she was saying that she wanted to pursue a relationship.  And it's all bullshit.  She's just looking for her payday, which is a new phenomenon out there. 
[01:04:00]  Another bullshit.  Speak fucking story.  It's so irritating.  The fucking models.  And these chicks that come to your hotel.  And I'm assuming he paid her to be there.  Like, what the fuck do you expect?  Yeah.  And they want a little more.  And he's such a pervert.  He ordered Coke.  And he ordered some pot.  Oh boy.  You know.  And she spills the beans.  Fuck him.  Big mouth.  And she was okay with all that?  Oh, I'm sure.  You know.  Apparently she was.  You know, it leads to the other story.  Oh my god. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  You know.  There's a woman here in New York yelling rape.  And you know, as soon as you say.  Rape.  As soon as you say you don't believe her.  You know, a lot of women come out of the woodwork.  But there's a lot.  You're the problem.  Because that's why women don't like coming forward.  Because people like you say they're lying or it's not true.  Look.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  There's a guy.  His name's Greg Kelly.  Yes.  Does a little TV show every morning on Fox and.  Not Fox and Friends.  Local Fox. 
[01:05:00]  Local Fox.  Good day New York.  Good day New York.  And he.  And his father.  He's the son of Ray Kelly.  Ray Kelly.  The police commissioner of New York City.  Ray Kelly.  And today he's on the front page of the paper because some woman is accusing him of rape.  Now, initially when I first heard the story.  I first heard the beginning of the story.  I'm listening intently.  And I hear some things that make me think.  I don't know about this.  A woman came forward Tuesday.  This past Tuesday.  Right. 
[01:05:30]  And said that he had.  She walked into a police station.  Walked into a police station.  With her sister.  With her friend.  With her sister.  And said that this gentleman had somehow sexually assaulted her.  Right.  In some way shape or form.  Right.  Well, it supposedly took place in October.  Now, a lot of the women.  I'll speak for them.  They're going to go.  Well, look.  She was scared to come forward at first.  Right.  Right.  Scared to come forward at first.  Somehow they met.  I don't know. 
[01:06:00]  In the street.  Online.  On the street.  Yeah.  They went and had a few drinks back in October.  And then she brought him back to her office.  Law firm.  To the office.  And they had sex.  Now, at night.  At the office.  After, you know, you're out.  You're not doing a few, you know.  You're not doing some work.  Because she didn't have to catch up on some work.  And he tagged along to help file.  I think there's a lot of people out there that certainly use their offices for sex.  Yeah.  When they have nowhere else to go.  Right. 
[01:06:30]  And why else would you go back to the office at that point?  Exactly.  I believe she has a boyfriend.  Yes.  And there is the problem.  There's the fucking brunt of this whole story.  So, we...  I think we're in agreement.  We feel that the boyfriend found out.  Right.  Maybe through a text or something.  They probably had some consensual sex.  Right.  And now...  In that office.  The boyfriend finds out.  And now she's in a panic.  Yeah.  She panics.  She's trying to explain herself.  Because maybe, you know, she doesn't have an actual relationship with Greg Kelly.  Maybe it was just a tryst.  I don't know. 
[01:07:00]  Yep.  And now...  And then she's got to go, well, I didn't do it willingly.  Well, what happened?  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  No problem.  This is what annoys me.  This is an unpopular stance, by the way.  I hope people understand we're being brave right now.  His name...  I'm serious, because most people aren't going to say this shit.  His name is in the paper.  Accused of rape.  Right.  And hers is not. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  I completely agree with protecting the victim's identity, but the fact that you can publicly  be accused of rape while the victim's identity, you should not...  They shouldn't print your name...  Right.  Until you're convicted.  Right.  If they're going to go by those rules, because if he's innocent, you know, it's fucking...  Yeah.  He's already...  He's smeared.  He's smeared.  Right.  He's smeared.  Yeah.  That's all we know.  That's...  That's our... 
[01:08:00]  That's our thoughts on it.  That's...  We'll have to wait and see as more info comes out, but...  Yeah.  We'll see what happened.  But this is...  This seems extremely suspicious.  Yeah.  I think the boyfriend fell out.  Like, she might have been fooling around, obviously, and all of a sudden the boyfriend  finds out, and now she needs a story.  Yeah.  Because why are you going...  Why are you meeting him in the street and going for drinks?  What the fuck are you doing?  Right.  Stop it.  Right.  Yeah.  There's intent there, right?  No means no, no matter when I say it.  Shut up.  I just don't buy it.  Shut up.  We could be completely wrong, and we'll certainly... 
[01:08:30]  No means no.  Yeah.  Admit that.  I won't, but...  We'll have to, but I don't know.  I'll spend it.  Greg Kelly, I mean, the little I know about him, he's like just a...  Yeah.  Doesn't seem like the type, but...  He just wanted to fucking get laid, eh, whatever.  Oh, the two also stayed in contact after this alleged rape.  Yeah, the Daily News article says the woman who had invited the anchor back to her office  continued to have contact with him after the alleged rape. 
[01:09:00]  Okay, so he rapes her, and then they continue a text relationship.  That's how it works.  Yeah.  That's what you do.  See?  Guy raped you.  Keep talking to him.  That makes a lot of sense.  And then there was probably some kind of text, and something happened.  The boyfriend saw it, realized, like, they were shenanigans, and she fucking loses her  mind.  Yeah, because she was dumb and probably put his name in...  Yeah.  ...as his name, where he texted his cock, or whatever it was that happened.  Oh.  That's what I would have done.  Of course.  Wow, what an idiot. 
[01:09:30]  Well...  I just think, yeah, this, boy, it's hard to squeak out from under those rape charges.  Yeah.  Yeah, protect yourself.  Yes, you do.  Always protect yourself.  Exactly.  Yeah, because what does the front page say?  Kelly...  Son, sex probe.  Sex probe.  Front page.  Wow.  Of course her name is protected.  And if she's telling the truth and he's guilty, he should be publicly humiliated.  Yeah, of course.  And not until he's convicted.  Of course.  There's some suspicious stuff here, though. 
[01:10:00]  Yep.  October, and she comes forward now?  Yeah, why?  November, December, January?  Three months later.  Why?  And stays in communication with the guy?  Nuff.  Yeah, I don't buy that.  That's...  Looks like someone might be trying to cover their eyes.  I know a comedian who was, I think a chick blew him, and she had a boyfriend, and she  was an agent.  And then a boyfriend found out, or whatever happened, and then she tried to file rape  charges.  Oh, God.  And he didn't do it.  And now he's suing her for a lot of money. 
[01:10:30]  A comic, you know?  Yeah.  For defamation.  Wow.  Whatever slander, whatever the legal term is, I'm so happy.  I hope he fucking gets everything for her.  Oh, man.  Wow.  First of all, she's an agent.  Yuck.  But second of all, if she tried to ruin his fucking life to protect her relationship,  the twat.  Man, that's a load of shit.  Unbelievable.  Now this.  Gentlemen, give yourself a gift of a night with Jenna Jameson. 
[01:11:00]  Get ready for the first Boston area appearance of adult video superstar Jenna Jameson.  Oh, wow.  I love what Jimmy figures it out.  First Boston appearance of Jenna Jameson.  Now, where the fuck was this found?  Do you know what this is, Jimmy, yet?  No.  I mean, I do know.  Think.  Think.  Oh, I know what program it's from.  Okay.  But I'm just going back and thinking first Boston appearance of Jenna Jameson. 
[01:11:30]  That's mid-90s.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It is.  Remember how Anthony was bragging about his production skills yesterday?  Oh, look.  I was never bragging about my skills.  I was bragging about the fact that my skills were recognized.  And he got an award.  And he got an award.  Exactly.  We hear that again?  There's a difference there, you know.  Well, we got more.  Kevin from Connecticut, thank you.  Where did he find this shit?  Kevin from Connecticut has been collecting audio of our show since the AEF days.  Commercials from back then are still fucking.  He's good.  Well, he probably, you know.  Yeah, on tape or something. 
[01:12:00]  He probably recorded entire shows with the commercials and everything.  And this wasn't my award-winning spot, you know.  And I still stand by this.  They told me.  Put a lot of echo on it.  It was all about echo back then.  It was all about echo when you're doing strip go.  And sound like fucking, you know.  Yeah, guys.  Come on in here.  Get some pussy.  You know.  You had to sound like that.  Gentlemen, give yourself a gift of a night with Jenna James.  To get ready for the first Boston area appearance of adult video superstar, Jenna James.  He's in Matthew from Kingsborough.  Now through Saturday.  And she's guaranteed to pack it in wall to wall. 
[01:12:30]  You don't want to get left down in the cold.  Hot, busty, natural blonde.  Beautiful face.  Jenna's got it all.  And she's going to show it to you.  Now through Saturday at Matthews in Kingsborough.  To anticipate an overwhelming demand, Jenna will be making a special additional floor show each day at 5pm.  Other shows at 8, 10 and midnight.  Guys, if there's one lady that sets the scene to curb all others to aspire to, it's Jenna James.  And there's only one adult entertainment club good enough to have her appear.  Matthews in Kingsborough.  World-class adult entertainment with a touch of clack.  In the last 90 days, Matthews has presented you a beautiful adult film star. 
[01:13:00]  Now through Saturday, Matthews is bringing you the best, the hottest, the star of Wicked Pictures films.  The one and only Jenna Jameson.  Matthews is located up Route 3, exit 36.  Just 40 minutes from downtown Boston.  For more information and directions, call Matthews at 508-649-2900.  Wow.  Just 40 minutes from Boston.  Terrible.  And the music ended perfectly.  Yeah, see, I had to put all that together.  Not so terrible, Jimmy.  Fucking Matthews.  No, not at all.  We fucking hung out at Matthews.  No, no, no.  What's terrible is to say that just 40 minutes from downtown Boston. 
[01:13:30]  Because that's what you want to do.  Drive 40 minutes to a strip club, drink, and then drive back in Boston.  Most people didn't live in Boston proper that were listening to our show though, so.  That's true.  Well, I don't think the drive from Worcester was any treat either.  No.  I'll tell you the truth.  Matthews was good though.  That's nice up there.  Matthews in Tingsboro.  Is it still there?  I'm a puker on that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, we used to call that puking.  Sounds like a WWE commercial.  Sounds like a monster truck commercial.  A lot of echo. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  They wanted that.  A lot of echo.  A lot of fucking.  That's what they wanted.  Classy adult entertainment with a touch of class.  Class, class, class.  Classy class at a class classy.  Yeah, class.  Something about class.  Yeah, class.  Or a class.  That was pretty good.  That was pretty good.  Well, he should get some of my award winning spots.  Because that's just silly.  Do you remember which one actually won the award?  Yeah, it was for that head shop.  What the fuck was that head shop called?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  In Hyannis.  Right?  It was the one in Hyannis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember.  Yeah.  It was a head shop.  Hyannis.  Yeah, that's what they used to say.  Sam.  It looks like Matthew's is now Angela's coal-fired pizza.  Oh.  Angela's coal-fired pizza.  God.  Really?  Yeah.  Hot pizza.  Yeah.  Big juicy pepperonis.  They're dripping with cheese. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  They realize vaginas were all over that place.  I know.  Now they're making pizza.  Yeah.  Great.  All right.  Hey, we're doing a best man speech competition.  Are we getting entries?  Yes.  I sure hope so.  Any good ones yet, Sam?  Yeah, there are a bunch of them.  We have to go through and figure out.  Maybe next week we'll play some of them.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  I got an example of another one.  Just to get the contest really rolling.  Nice.  Danny pulled this one.  Basically, we're looking for those really bad best man speeches. 
[01:15:30]  And the bride of honor, too.  Yeah.  Maid of honor, excuse me.  Maid of honor speeches, which is really hot these days.  A thousand dollars.  We love to be embarrassing.  Well, Steven Singer jewelers, of course.  Oh, of course.  Is he the only sponsor to this show?  Yes.  Me and Ann were talking about this the other day.  Is he the only sponsor?  He's the only sponsor?  We're amazed.  We're going to say it.  Yeah.  That a fucking beer company is not sponsoring this radio show.  How does the sales department?  We just have four of them.  That's a crack sales department.  They suck. 
[01:16:00]  How do they not just get some beer on board?  And don't blame us.  We're doing the show that we were asked to do and paid to do.  And we do a great job at this, believe me.  Yeah.  So how come you can't just go to a beer company, something that fits the lifestyle of the listeners, you know, knives and just get fucking the beer guys on.  It's literally on board.  Ridiculous.  Yeah.  It's fucking ridiculous.  We have great.  We had great relationships with Budweiser and Sam Adams. 
[01:16:30]  But I think he's ready to be a sponsor.  I think he's ready to come back.  Herbs, too.  I think Jim Cook's ready to come back.  You think?  I don't know about that.  I think so.  God, how long has it been?  Please.  Let me see if I still have his number.  Should we call him?  Hi, Opie.  No, you guys can go fuck yourselves.  I'm never coming on board with you again.  Oh, you know what?  That's my beer.  That's how bad it is.  I think I did take him out of my phone.  Oh. 
[01:17:00]  I used to have his cell number.  I'm sorry, Opie.  The number you've reached has been disconnected.  Well, wait.  Maybe I got him under Sam Adams.  Jim Sam Adams.  Uh-oh.  Jim Sam Adams.  Let's see if he's willing to come back on our show.  He was a nice guy, but I never...  You know, he was stupid hops.  Not if you pound 50 pounds of hops up your asshole pound.  9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.  Do you have a mailbox on the system?  Yeah, I just got an office number now. 
[01:17:30]  I used to have real good digits for him.  Yeah.  No digits.  No more.  My digits.  Yeah.  Hey.  What?  Oh, boy.  So Steven Singer, our only sponsor?  And we love Steven Singer.  Yeah.  Don't get us wrong.  Oh, thank God for Steven Singer.  He's this contest sponsor.  It's $1,000.  He sponsors every contest.  He loves the show very much.  I guess he's the only one that they could get on board.  Right.  He's the only one who they could get any advertising for. 
[01:18:00]  It's not that people aren't doing their jobs.  He's the only one.  Right.  Let's go.  Good job.  So where do they send their best man speeches?  SiriusXM.  Which are really bad, obviously.  Right, of course.  SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony has all the rules and the email address.  And are you getting maid of honor things, too?  I think just best man speeches.  Is that the contest?  We can't have maid of honors in there?  No, we can't.  Just so far, we've only had best man.  Well, how about it?  How about it, ladies? 
[01:18:30]  Exactly.  You know how it is with ladies in these contests, man.  You know someone has bombed at a wedding.  You know about it.  Get that audio and send it in.  You can win money.  Here's an example of another really bad best man speech.  Well, I'm a really bad public speaker.  So I just want to appreciate what the camera is.  It's really sweet on YouTube or something like that.  Or Gmail or whatever one has.  So, I also think he's such an awesome guy. 
[01:19:00]  His heart is so big that everyone in the room can have a part of it.  And I appreciate that.  His heart is so big that everyone in the room could have a part of it.  A part of it?  A part of it.  Is this a zombie wedding?  Yeah.  There's enough heart to go around.  There's hearts and lungs.  A lung and a wing.  How about a wing?  And I appreciate that Kenny actually found an awesome girl.  And an awesome girl, Michelle, actually found Kenny. 
[01:19:30]  I heard a snicker.  Uh-oh.  Did you just drop the n-bomb?  Oh, I heard a snicker.  It was in my speech because I actually think it's funny in my mind.  Because I know people really find it funny in your own mind.  If you find it funny in my mind, you'll find it funny in your mind.  What's going on here? 
[01:20:00]  I don't know.  It's a catastrophe.  I'm not good at public speaking.  But then what's going on with the mic?  He's not talking into it.  Yeah, it's very low holding it.  Oh, so everyone's yelling.  Yeah, talking to the microphone, dum-dum.  Oh, so the audio's going to get better?  I hope so.  Unfortunately, yeah.  Some of these guys, if they're bad, they don't have any confidence.  And if they don't have confidence, they don't speak into the mic properly.  He also started by saying he didn't want anybody to share it on YouTube or Gmail.  Or Gmail. 
[01:20:30]  If you're lying.  They're lying.  They're lying.  They're lying.  They're lying.  I mean, can you actually ask me?  Oh, there's a, okay.  Can you actually ask me if he's the best man?  I said no for the longest time.  Because I don't like public speaking and I'm not a good liar and....  It's killing.  Is it going to lie?  If you guys like this joke?  It's fine.  If you guys like this joke.  Go go, go, go.  I'm glad to see everyone here making it for the trip 
[01:21:00]  and being safe and coming down here.  It's actually been a privilege to be asked by Kenan  to be his best man.  Somebody's not like any of you people.  What's killing, though? What happened?  Well, I suppose the first thing I have to do is, you know, I'm Jeff. 
[01:21:30]  I'm a Kenan's best friend.  Bear with me, people.  I got a full page here.  I'm Jeff.  My full name's Jeff, would you like a drink?  And if anyone wants to talk to me later,  I would prefer if you use my full name.  Jeff, would you like a drink?  Oh, boy.  I'll get a look. 
[01:22:00]  Okay.  I know.  I've never been the best man before.  So, if I actually do a good job tonight,  Kenny's going to ask me to be his best man.  Okay.  I've never been the best man before.  So, if I do a good job tonight, 
[01:22:30]  Kenny's going to ask me to be his best man at his next wedding.  I guess he's motherfucking the marriage, right there.  No, I got like five more minutes, man.  I'm not sure he's got a red light, this guy. 
[01:23:00]  Really?  You got it?  No, but I'm doing good, though, right?  I'm not about you.  This guy's making it all about him.  Does everyone in here work for Jeff?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  He's got to be respectful.  That's all you have to do.  Basically, with your best man's speech, what you have to do is congratulate Kenny. 
[01:23:30]  Congratulate him on his bride.  Say how much he's bettered his life.  Yeah, thank you.  That's what you have to do with his speech.  Can you tell me this now?  Yeah!  I don't know.  We can go over here.  We can go, man.  He didn't give me a call.  It's technology.  So, hey, let's start over there.  Do that.  Okay, I got two more jokes.  It took me a while to do this.  If I did this...  Okay.  Um...  This is terrible.  This is really bad.  This is really bad.  Really bad.  It's actually light. 
[01:24:00]  Okay.  Okay, the last joke.  Oh, I actually talked to Kenny's co-workers and everything.  And they, uh...  Like, how would you explain Kenny?  You know, being a good guy, good art and everything.  And they actually said...  Uh...  He was, like, dead like.  Because, uh...  He was, like, dead like.  Because, uh...  He's, uh...  He's, uh...  He's, uh...  He's, uh...  He's, uh...  He's, uh...  He's, uh...  He's really seen.  He's holier than thou.  And if he does any work, it's weird.  Even...  Can't hear you! 
[01:24:30]  Can't hear you!  Okay, I'm done and learn his voice.  Ed Firth.  He needs to lie to the boy.  And...  You know?  I can't hear you!  How else?  I can't hear you!  I can't hear you!  He's wh Cory!  Okay, I'm done.  I got it.  All right.  And that was painful. 
[01:25:00]  Those are the jokes and everything, so now I'm going to be serious.  Well, actually, for the poor people, without them, I definitely want to be here.  So I want to raise my class to the bar staff.  And to close, for Kenny and Michelle, I wish you well for the future, to love, to life, to laughter, and happily ever after. 
[01:25:30]  I don't pronounce you Kenny and Michelle, but Kenny and Michelle, I give you Kenny and Michelle.  Well, is that it, hopefully?  I guess we're looking for that, but hopefully your audio's a little better.  We're looking for, I think, something a little quicker.  Something a little more concisely douchey.  It doesn't have to be that bad to win this out. 
[01:26:00]  No, no, that was just really bad.  Do people understand the audio, hopefully?  Part-time.  Kind of?  I thought about a quarter of that.  Yeah.  Talking to Roland.  Catch every fourth letter.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We have to take a break.  So we're looking for your really bad best man speeches.  Yes.  Where's the website again?  SeriousXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  All right, that sucked the energy out of the room, but we're going to get it back, people.  Yes. 
[01:26:30]  We're going to get it back.  The Fonz coming in next.  Yes.  Yes.  He's promoting his book, I've Never Met an Idiot on the River, Reflections of Family,  Photography, and Fly Fishing.  He mentioned it last time when he stopped in.  Yes.  He bumped into Bob Kelly while he was fishing.  See, get it?  An idiot.  That's funny.  That's funny.  All right.  We'll talk to him next.  Stay there.  We like it when people like us.  So why don't you follow the Opie and Anthony Show online by checking out our Facebook and  hitting like. 
[01:27:00]  Just go to Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Now you can stay up to date with all of the latest show info and continue to stalk your  high school sweetheart at the same time.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's get Henry Winkler in studio.  Henry Winkler.  Henry Winkler is back.  How you been?  We met him very briefly a few months ago.  Yeah.  He's dropped in.  He was doing a bunch of other stations and dropped in.  He was kind enough to come in and say hi to us.  Yes.  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  But that was unannounced.  Yes.  It was very unplanned.  It wasn't official.  No.  This is official.  This is an official visit, sir.  Yeah.  I thought I would dress up for you.  Thank you very much.  You're very welcome.  You know what you're dressed like, though?  An author.  Yeah.  You're dressed like an author.  Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today.  Yes, exactly.  Well, let's make sure we get the title of the book right off the bat here.  I've never met an idiot on the river.  Reflections on family, photography, and fly fishing.  Yes.  That was my first adult book. 
[01:28:00]  And then last week, Ghost Buddy came out.  Oh, are we promoting Ghost Buddy and not the other one?  Well, you know what?  We can promote both because maybe we would sell a fishing book.  Yes.  But the fishing book, it was a book of photographs that I took while fly fishing for trout.  Right.  But Ghost Buddy, I write with Lynn Oliver.  It is our 19th novel together.  Wow.  19th.  Yeah.  And it's for kids 7 to 14. 
[01:28:30]  And it's a story about two young men.  One is a ghost.  He finds the ghost in his closet.  Billy Broccoli moves into a brand new home with a new blended family.  His father is a dentist.  You know, we wear cell phones on our belts.  His father now wears floss.  Oh, okay.  And he can't sleep.  Mm-hmm.  His baseball jersey floats out of the closet.  It mires itself in front of the mirror. 
[01:29:00]  He turns around and says, all right, look, you can call me a ghost.  You can call me Phantom.  You can call me a banshee.  I think that is rude.  That's Fonzie, dammit.  I know.  I just heard the Fonz.  I heard the Fonz.  Where?  Can I?  I was doing...  Ghost.  Yes.  Hoover Quarterhouse, the third, or also known as The Hoof.  The Hoof.  We were literally just talking about you a few days ago, about how you were the greatest 
[01:29:30]  character possibly ever.  Wow.  As far as popularity goes.  Wow, that's very lovely.  Yeah, I would think so.  Yeah, definitely.  As far as popularity goes, we couldn't think of someone that was bigger.  Well, I'll tell you what still kills me.  That now, all these years later, over 30 years later, people stop me everywhere in the  world as if, you know, I was just on the air, as if it is a planned show.  You probably were.  Yeah.  It's playing all over.  It is amazing.  Amazing.  Do you ever get sick of it? 
[01:30:00]  Never, ever, ever.  No, never.  Oh, bravo for you, because a lot of people would say, yeah.  But look what happened.  I don't know that I would be sitting here in front of this microphone with you if I didn't  do that first.  Right, right.  You know, he introduced me to the world.  No.  We had a great time last time.  Yeah.  I was really looking forward to coming.  Yeah.  It's weird to write, because you write for, the first time we met was at a book signing  you were doing a reading at Barnes & Noble on 68th Street.  That's right.  And I just saw your name, so I'm like, all right, I'll buy a book. 
[01:30:30]  I didn't know what it was, and I sat down.  I think you showed great taste.  Yeah, it was actually, it was an enjoyable, you know, it's for, like you said, you know,  10, 11-year-old kids, and it's kind of cool because it gets them into reading young.  Yes.  You can't start reading cynical biographies at seven.  That's what happens.  The letters that we get are from parents who say, oh my goodness, I just passed my children's  room, and they were laughing reading a book.  Reluctant readers, we don't write down to the kids, so they write, hey, how did you know 
[01:31:00]  me so well?  And some kids just write and say, you know, it is hilarious.  That's awesome.  How do you avoid adult stuff in a kid's book, though?  Like, it would be hard, I think, to write for something that a kid would enjoy as an  adult.  Like, how do you say, like, ah, that's too adult, that's a reference?  You know what?  You get a feel for it, but there's also stuff because parents read along with the kids,  so they read together, and there's stuff in there for the parents to laugh at, too. 
[01:31:30]  Do you know?  So we're very proud of that.  Hank Zipser has sold close to four million copies, and Ghost Buddy just came out.  Wow.  So you think this could turn into a movie, maybe?  You know what?  It is cinematic, that is for sure, but you'd never know.  Have any of them turned into movies?  No, not yet.  Not yet.  There is an English company that wants to do the Hank Zipser books as a TV show in England.  Right.  You could be the next, like, Harry Potter. 
[01:32:00]  Well, probably not.  Well, you know.  I know my limitations.  No, that was an amazing, amazing explosion.  How do you market these?  Because...  You come here, and you talk to people, and hopefully...  You talk to the parents.  Yes, and hopefully parents say, wow, I would like my kid to read these are funny, funny books.  Right.  It's the relationship between this live kid and a ghost who is 14, died 99 years ago.  His dream, the ghost's dream, is to see a major league baseball park, but he can't leave the house until he gets good grades from the higher-ups. 
[01:32:30]  And the way he gets good grades is by helping the little boy who just moved in the house meet his potential.  Except the ghost is irresponsible.  Ah, there's the twist.  Probably explain how he died.  The twist.  The right, yes.  Yeah, he took the Model T and crashed into the orange groves.  Oh, boy, that'll do it. 
[01:33:00]  It used to be Southern California.  Now it's all homes.  Yes.  So, are you a good collaborator?  Like, I could never write something with another person.  Like, you've written 20 books.  You can't write anything alone.  That's exactly the point.  I'm teasing.  Jimmy's put out two books.  No, you know what?  I have, my partner and I, this is the way we work, I go to her office at 10 o'clock in the morning.  She is about 20 minutes from where I live.  We schmooze in the morning.  We have a cup of coffee.  We talk about the kids.  Do you take your bike?  No, I don't.  I don't. 
[01:33:30]  I actually have never ridden a bike.  But, you know, that's my own personal secret.  It's a torment that I have.  I don't doubt it.  You rode for the show.  We saw you on the bike.  Yeah, no, I, I, but that was only going up the hill.  And then somebody caught me.  That's like, caught him.  That's great.  Yeah.  No, you know, the first time they put me on a bike, I had to travel five feet.  And I turned the gas and I'm so dyslexic.  I didn't know where they, the gas and the clutch was. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, no.  I smashed into the sound truck, dropped the bike.  We slid under the sound truck.  They came running up and they pulled the bike out because it was rented.  And then they remembered I was.  Yeah.  The important thing.  Yeah.  The bike.  They never let me ride it again.  Are you really dyslexic?  I am.  I'm, I, that is where Hank Zipser comes from.  Uh, yes, I am, uh, learning challenged.  Is, is he as well?  No.  Uh, Billy Broccoli is not.  He is just socially challenged. 
[01:34:30]  No, Hank Zipser, I mean.  Hank Zipser is, yes.  Hank is short for Henry.  Uh, Zipser was a woman who lived on the fourth floor of my apartment building.  I thought it was a zippy name, but, uh, ghost buddy.  No, this is about bullying and about being responsible to one another.  So what happened when you were, you're dyslexic.  Cause you know, now we know what that is, but years ago they had no idea.  No, I just thought I was stupid.  They, they, they just said you're stupid and you can't learn.  That's exactly right.  And what finally happened where they were like, oh, there's a, there's something to this.  My son, my stepson Jed, uh, was in the third grade and I said everything to him that was said to me. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, you're being lazy.  Oh, you're not living up to your potential.  Go upstairs and try harder.  And he couldn't do it.  He couldn't write this report.  And we had him tested and everything they said about him was true about me.  Wow.  So at about 31, I found out that I was not, um, you know, a dumb dog.  I literally had a, a name.  Is there a way?  Was it, is it harder to, when you're dyslexic, is it hard to like, to, to read the words in 
[01:35:30]  order or how does that affect you?  Do you know what?  For every child, there is another way it's wiring in the brain.  So some children, uh, it is hard to read.  Uh, I can't sound out words.  I can't spell at all.  Uh, math is difficult for me.  Uh, but every child has a variation on a theme and it is hereditary.  So it's passed on from generation to generation.  That's why he couldn't say the word wrong. 
[01:36:00]  That's right.  It was a W and me trying to sound it out.  I remember that.  I'm sorry.  I was, yeah, yeah.  I was, I was, I was, I was, but how did that affect your acting?  Yeah.  In the script reading.  Yeah.  In the script reading.  You know what?  If you want something bad enough, you figure out how to do it.  I read my scripts very slowly, one word at a time so that I got the word on the page  and then I memorized it. 
[01:36:30]  And then, uh, once I memorized it, once I changed my voice, once I started talking like  this and I changed my body, it was like a, it unlocked me.  Wow.  He's like, I could, I could just do anything.  He just grabbed Jimmy.  It's, but it's almost like when a stutterer sings, it's like, it takes away the stutter.  James Earl Jones, major stutterer.  Is he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And known as one of the greatest voiceover guys.  Oh my God.  Oh my goodness.  Yeah.  Like a Darth Vader stuttering? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Who knew?  Yeah.  Where is the rebel base?  Doesn't come off as good.  You know, I didn't know that until just now.  I didn't either.  So how'd he get past that?  He worked on it.  Right.  And when he was acting, when he became a character, he was able to form the, uh, the complete sentence.  He's a good friend of mine and he, uh, to watch him on stage is like a gift.  Right.  You know?  What happened to Chuck?  Yeah.  Please. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  I was trying to figure this one out forever.  All right.  Season one, Chuck was Richie's brother.  What is the...  He went upstairs.  Right.  And we never heard from him again.  Okay.  But then Happy Days never even acknowledges he ever existed.  And he was on the opening sequence, which is odd.  Yes, that's true.  Yeah.  Right.  Okay.  So there were two trucks.  Two Chucks.  One, the first Chuck decided, hey, I don't want to do this.  I don't want to be an actor.  And left.  He just left.  Yeah.  How far into it?  Very, very short.  Do you know what that guy's doing?  Yes.  He is in San Diego. 
[01:38:00]  I think he sells insurance.  All right.  All right.  So he's happy.  He would rather do that.  Number two.  They hired a second Chuck, and then they realized there was no room for the older brother,  because the Fonz was becoming the older brother.  Oh.  Yeah.  So they sent him upstairs.  They sent him to college, and he is still matriculating.  They just write him off.  They wrote him right out.  What is that guy doing?  He moved to Ireland, and he became, you know, he was an actor. 
[01:38:30]  He was in Willow with Ron Howard.  No kidding.  Yeah.  No kidding.  I guess Ron Howard feels like he owes him one.  Yeah.  He feels guilty.  But that's so weird that they wrote him off like that.  And I wonder, as an actor, do you know that you're being written off, or does your agent  go, no, no, no, look, this Fonzie thing is going to run its course in six episodes?  Just stick around.  Right.  They almost never tell you.  They don't?  No.  They make a decision.  You know, you could be in the middle of an episode, and somebody comes down and says,  well, that's it.  And you're kind of, geez, that's it. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  I mean, there was no, like, thanks for your really hard work.  Right.  You know, that's it.  Okay, everybody go home.  And your character, me and Ann were talking, and Jimmy, was it the whole first season you  didn't talk?  No, I had six lines.  Six lines.  I had six lines.  But then the second season, you were talking.  Yeah.  By the time we did the show, where I was cheating from Richie in class, and the bird,  you know, pooped all over the answer, so I had to do it myself.  Right.  That was the beginning of the rise of the Fonz. 
[01:39:30]  So someone saw something in you.  Yeah.  In the character.  Well, the audience, for one.  Yeah, the audience went for it.  We came on the air in February of 74, I believe.  So in April, I'm making my first appearance in Little Rock, Arkansas.  I'm getting $1,000 to fly to Little Rock and Saturday and Sunday stand in a mall and sign  autographs.  Jeez.  And I got off the plane at 1130 at night after we shot the show in Little Rock. 
[01:40:00]  3,000 people were waiting at the airport.  At the airport?  Yeah.  At the airport at 1130 at night.  And I thought, oh my goodness, here's a party.  I don't want to, like, disturb their parties or another way to walk around.  And the stewardess said, no, I think they're here for you.  Wow.  And almost every girl was in a poodle skirt.  And they were there and they cheered when I walked off the plane.  It was, like, shocking.  How was your signing at the mall? 
[01:40:30]  I signed 8,000.  Wow.  Oh, man.  How many hours?  Saturday and then Sunday.  And I put my arm in a sling.  From signing, right?  From signing, right?  And then the next public appearance I made was in Detroit at Pontiac Stadium.  181,000 people over two days filed through the stadium.  That's insanity.  And we were saying how fame has changed and people just don't become that famous anymore. 
[01:41:00]  No.  Especially, like, if you're doing sitcoms.  Back then, it was an amazing thing.  You got to a point where you couldn't just leave your house or anything?  No, I stayed home a lot.  I read every letter that was sent to me.  They brought me boxes.  I had boxes in my apartment because it was scary.  Did you have bodyguards?  How many bodyguards would you have when you went out?  Only when I left L.A.  Like, I was the king of Bacchus, the beautiful parade at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. 
[01:41:30]  And I was surrounded by 12 cops.  And I walked like in a pod.  A pod of policemen.  And this was amazing.  Girls would scream in your ear, you know, as you walk by.  And at a certain decibel, you pass out.  So I learned to walk, pass out, keep walking.  Jesus!  You passed out?  I did.  Because the decibel, you would faint from the perfect scream in your ear.  I've had that, but not for the same reasons. 
[01:42:00]  So you couldn't leave your...  Was your reason enjoyable?  Oh yeah, that's what he said.  Briefly.  Okay, even for a second.  That's a wonderful thing.  Did you know you could pass out from someone screaming at you?  I had no idea.  I didn't know.  Yeah, from a certain decibel.  It was...  That shows you how famous we are, Henry.  Huh?  That shows you how famous we are.  We'll never hear that.  Yeah.  We'll never hear that type of decibel yet.  No, but it was...  How many years did you live like that?  Uh, ten. 
[01:42:30]  Ten.  Wow.  Ten.  And then, you know, when I...  People don't yell at me anymore, but I'm treated with just extraordinary warmth.  Yeah.  Everywhere you go, you probably can't go anywhere.  You still look...  You know, exactly...  I brought my children to the, um, uh, to the reservations, uh, for the Native Americans  in New Mexico at Christmas time.  They have Christmas, uh, uh, celebrations.  And so we were there and we were watching, uh, in, uh, Santa Fe, outside of Santa Fe. 
[01:43:00]  And beautiful, beautiful, uh, celebrations.  And as I was walking, uh, back to my car, these moms came out of their, uh, dwellings and literally  presented me with baking hot bread because I was respectful to Native Americans on a Thanksgiving  show.  Oh, my God.  Do you know?  It was, um, uh, we went to visit the Hopi in, uh, Arizona. 
[01:43:30]  Uh, they live on the flat mountains, you know, on the mesas.  They watch television.  Um, uh, some of them, they have no electricity, so they watch it with their car battery.  Oh.  And I was able to take a picture of the Kachina clown dances.  You're not allowed to take a picture of the Hopi.  You must lock your camera in the car.  I thought that was one of the greatest honors of my entire life. 
[01:44:00]  Did you sneak the picture or they told you it was okay?  No, no.  They said, um, please go get your camera because I was respectful to Native Americans as the  Fonz.  In an episode.  Yeah.  So it's really weird how culturally that really affects people.  And they remembered.  Oh.  Unbelievable.  Well, when Happy Days was on, there was, we talk about three, four channels.  Yes, that's right.  That's exactly right.  So the whole country was watching.  We got 48% of all televisions were watching.  Right.  48%.  Yes.  48%.  And now if a show does, what are we talking? 
[01:44:30]  11.  Eight.  I think it's less than 10.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  48% of every TV was watching Happy Days in that time slot.  Yeah.  Do you like what's on now?  Or, uh?  Some.  What do I watch?  I watch Homeland.  Uh, Kelsey Grammer's new show, Boss, is amazing.  The Good Wife.  Did you find the camera work in Boss?  It took a little bit of getting used to the, uh, the camera work was very, very...  In your face.  Yeah.  Because the politics is so in your face.  The character is so in your face.  They want you to feel something, right? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  And Homeland is the Claire Danes one, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw the whole first season.  That was very good.  You know what?  I love Harry's Law.  Okay.  Modern Family.  It's funny.  And then we just finished the fourth season of Children's Hospital, which will come on  again in May.  Right.  Which is...  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is an outrageous comedy that's on 12 o'clock at night.  It was the first live action show on the Cartoon Network.  And it's on Thursday nights at 12 o'clock. 
[01:45:30]  It's very strange.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't understand what I'm doing.  We got Cindy that really wants to talk to you.  And I have to put on my earphone.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  Cindy, we got Henry Winkler in the studio.  He's promoting Ghost Buddy.  Hello, Henry.  It's such a pleasure to talk to you.  Thank you so much for taking my call.  Cindy, I didn't know what else to give you.  I want to tell you that my son is a 14 year old.  He's in eighth grade and he has dyslexia.  When I was a child, yes, I was young and I watched Happy Days religiously. 
[01:46:00]  I had a fondie t-shirt and I was all about the fonds.  Thank you.  And I didn't realize then why I admired you so much until I got older and was the parent  of someone with dyslexia and found out your story.  And I just want to thank you for being so genuine and being so honest about what you had  to go through.  I gave my son your Hank Zipzer books and he also loves baseball, so he was really motivated  to read them.  And seeing him read something that he was interested in and then knowing that you had written it 
[01:46:30]  really meant a lot to me.  So I wanted to thank you so much for that.  Cindy, that is the greatest compliment I could have gotten.  What is your son's name?  His name is Dan.  I swear to you, this is what I say to Dan.  It does not matter how you learn.  It doesn't matter at what rate you learn.  It has nothing to do with the brilliance that is inside you.  And I'm telling you those are not nice words.  That is the way it is on this earth. 
[01:47:00]  I am telling you the absolute truth.  Thank you so much for saying that.  He's really worked very, very hard.  I'll bet.  We actually sued to get him into a private school and now he can read at a 10th grade  level up from a 3rd grade level when he was in 6th grade.  See?  That makes my heart sore.  One day we'll get our own Sam to do that.  That's great.  Congratulations, Cindy.  And just tell him, I can't wait to meet Dan.  Oh, and that would be an honor for all of us.  Thank you so much. 
[01:47:30]  Thanks, Cindy.  Okay.  You know, some people, they have this huge success and they just kind of go away and,  you know, do their own thing.  You've been very out in the public and very helpful.  You don't have any of these, and you've never had any of these, for being such a big  celebrity, these skeletons that have popped out.  They're coming.  You've just been a genuine nice guy.  Scandals.  He's a nice guy.  That is really helpful and just nice, writes nice books and everything.  He's so nice.  Well, I write these great books.  It really is.  Makes me feel despicable.  That's not true. 
[01:48:00]  That's not true.  That's not true.  You look great in a blue shirt.  Well, thank you, sir.  He's so nice.  We're all on guard.  I know.  No.  This is our best behavior.  It is?  He did a PSA.  He did a PSA, too.  Oh, right.  The Happy Days PSA we played.  Yes, yes.  It was about sexual abuse for kids or something.  Right, right.  I remember that one.  That was a character.  But I write these books with Lynn Oliver, my partner, and she's here in New York.  We're going to be, as a matter of fact, this afternoon we're going to be at Books Bites  and Beyond in Glenrock, New Jersey at 4 o'clock this afternoon. 
[01:48:30]  4 o'clock this afternoon.  4 o'clock, yeah.  4 o'clock signing books.  Now, Jim Norton, is this a person, a singer?  It's me.  It is.  Finally.  Because I went to school with Jimmy Norton, who was on Broadway.  Is it Norton, N-A-U-G-H, or is that just your accent, or is it Norton?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe it's Norton.  Yeah.  That's me.  Oh, this is so great.  What is that right there?  That you're going to be in Tempe, Arizona. 
[01:49:00]  I can't do this.  Oh, my gosh.  At the end of January.  This is so cool.  What do you do?  I'm a stand-up.  Are you funny?  At times.  No, do you think the people, if they come, do you think it's worth their drive?  If they live in Tempe, if you can see the improv from your house, it's worth the drive.  All right, what about the people in Poughkeepsie on February 3rd and 4th?  You know what?  They're going to have a good time, because I have so much funnier in Poughkeepsie.  Much funnier in Tempe.  Yes, because I take Dramamine when I fly, which makes me tired and totally worthless.  And Atlanta must make you nuts. 
[01:49:30]  Well, February 16th through 18th, I will be in Atlanta, and that's always a good city for me.  Do you know one of the great, honestly, one of the great Italian restaurants in America is in Atlanta.  Where?  It's called, I'm going to come up with a name in a minute, because we're going to go right  on to Fort Lauderdale.  Yes, February 23rd through 25th, I will be at the improv.  I'm shooting an hour special, so I'm warming up for it.  Is it possible to be funny in Rochester?  It's difficult.  It is, isn't it?  Normally I'm funnier on the late show Saturday.  Isn't it always cold in Rochester? 
[01:50:00]  It's despicable.  And it rains a lot.  Frozen rain is a terrible, terrible place.  Toledo, Ohio.  Toledo.  Never been there.  Everybody moved.  March 8th through 10th, in honor of Klinger from MASH, I will be going to Toledo.  I think he was from Toledo, am I correct?  I think I'm right.  Look at this, you roll out of bed, because you're in New York City.  When?  March 29th through April 1st.  Unless I have to change that, because I'm shooting in Cleveland.  But as of right now, March 29th through April 1st, I will be at Carolina.  And he's also an author himself there, Henry.  You are?  You've written a book?  I've written a couple, yeah.  Wow, Jim. 
[01:50:30]  Yes, they were not.  New York Times bestseller.  Yeah, Jim's done very well for himself.  He's a very modest boy.  He's made the list.  That's fantastic.  Yeah, yeah.  They were certainly not.  They were a little different than your books, Henry.  A little different, yeah.  Just slightly different.  Not my demons.  About his ghost in the closet.  Yeah, right.  When you write, being dyslexic, is it hard for you to sit down and type something out,  or are you easier for you to be verbal?  No, it's a good question.  I'll tell you exactly what it is.  I walk around Lynn Oliver's office.  She sits at the computer.  I sit in a couch. 
[01:51:00]  I sit on an armchair in the rocking chair right in front of her desk.  Or I take off my shoes and I try to put my feet in the planks of the boards on her floor.  And then I start talking.  And she types.  Then she's got an idea.  She types.  I wait.  She reads it back to me.  We argue over every word.  Oh, really?  Okay.  And we've written 19 novels that way.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Completely collaborative.  So it's easy for you just to kind of... 
[01:51:30]  Sometimes is she just taking notes for you?  No.  No.  We literally write them together.  Absolutely.  But if you have an idea.  Say you're talking about...  There's a part in this where he meets the ghost.  But say you see something 15 pages later like,  No, but this can't happen now.  But then the ghost does this.  Will you just spit that out at her?  Absolutely.  Okay.  And this is the incredible thing.  You write a book.  You write an outline.  And we're following the outline.  But the book has a mind of its own.  So all of a sudden, you're writing, you're writing, you're writing. 
[01:52:00]  And the book takes you on a left turn.  And you've got to just go.  You've got to give up your outline and just go where the book takes you, right?  Yeah, I find that sometimes there's been things where it's tempting to cut yourself off.  Because you're like, it doesn't marry where I was going.  But once you allow yourself to go, sometimes you wind up getting an extra 10 or 12 pages.  Absolutely.  Which was way better than what you wanted to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Initially had.  You've got to go with the flow.  And it takes a lot of courage, you know?  And if anybody is thinking about being a writer out there, the only thing that I will say to you is write what you know and don't edit yourself until you're done. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  Just write anything.  And don't think you're going to embarrass somebody if you write too close to a relative.  Because they never pick up that it's them.  Right.  Yeah.  We should ask one more Happy Days question.  Go ahead.  I'm thinking of a good one.  Okay, good.  Well, was there ever anything that they wanted the Fonz to do that you personally went like, I don't think I would be comfortable doing that or the character itself wouldn't do that? 
[01:53:00]  Because it became synonymous with you.  Yes.  More than the writers, I think, even at that point.  Right.  So, was there anything that?  No.  The writers, Gary Marshall had writers that 21-year-olds all the way up to 77-year-olds in the room.  They worked really hard.  One of the first days I ever met Ron Howard.  Now, he's 18.  I'm 27.  We're on stage 19 on Paramount Lot.  I look at it. 
[01:53:30]  I'm from New York.  I'm looking at the script and I'm going, I can't do this.  And I start to punch the script.  I mean, this joke really sucks.  I can't do this.  He took me around the shoulder, led me to the back of the soundstage, and he said, you know, Henry, I think the writers are trying as hard as they can.  Let's not hit the script.  I said, Ron, I'm never going to hit the script again as long as I live.  And his wisdom, there is an old soul in Ron Howard. 
[01:54:00]  And he had been a veteran of television at that point.  Since three.  Since he was three.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Geez.  But the way he said it, I didn't take offense.  I just heard him, and he's been my brother ever since.  We've had him on the show too, and he's just another guy that just is a nice guy.  He's fantastic.  Yeah, yeah.  Powerful.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Powerful.  We all know that.  And to get like that without screwing people over.  He had great parents.  His father was the first sharecropper to leave the farm in Oklahoma and went to New York to be on Broadway. 
[01:54:30]  So his mom and dad were actors, and they never allowed bad behavior from either Ron or Clint Howard.  They would discipline them on the set to be respectful, do your work, be concentrated.  So they learned very well.  Just really nice.  They're telling us he has to go.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  He has to leave.  He's a busy man.  He has other press.  Busy man.  Let's promote.  Well, what a great morning.  Thank you.  Oh, please.  Great way to start the day.  I want to promote Henry's books too.  One that's been out for a while, but it's called I've Never Met an Idiot on the River.  It's an adult book.  An adult book about fishing and his photography.  Yeah.  And the book he's really pushing today is called Ghost Buddy.  It's good for your, you know, how old would you say?  I'd say 7 to 14.  7 to 14 and the woman called then.  And it's funny.  It's a funny book for someone who's 7 to 14. 
[01:55:30]  So have you got a 10 year old kid?  Perfect.  It'll make you laugh.  It probably would.  I enjoy that sunset humor.  Really quick, because we don't have time today.  Go ahead, Jim.  The signing.  He's showing us pictures.  I just wanted to comment.  Go ahead.  Books, Bites, and Beyond.  It's in Glen Rock, New Jersey.  It's today from 4 to 5.  There will be a good amount of people there, so get there early and buy your book and get  it signed.  Henry's a nice guy.  Yes.  I always thought fly fishing was a joke and then a comedian friend of ours took me and  I'm hooked.  Who?  Bob Kelly. 
[01:56:00]  Bob Kelly.  Right.  Obviously, you've never met him on the river.  I've never met Bob.  Your pictures look like they're from...  You know what?  I say the same thing.  I really do.  I went once and I was hooked.  You're hooked, right?  It is like a washing machine for your brain.  Your pictures look like they're from Montana, I'm assuming.  Yes, that's exactly right.  Yeah, we go to Roscoe, New York, which is a little different.  Oh, right.  I know Roscoe.  Well, it's one of the best places in the world.  Where's Roscoe?  Have you ever fished up there?  No.  I've never fished up there, but in six days I'm going to Argentina.  The same man that introduced me to fly fishing, Skip Brittenham III, my lawyer, is taking 
[01:56:30]  me to fish in Argentina.  So if the fish I catch in Montana are four pounds, in Argentina, they're 23 pounds.  Man.  Wowie zowie.  You have a friend that's going to take you to Argentina?  Yeah, I pay them.  You don't have friends like that.  No, no, no.  He invited me.  I have to pay the flight.  We just don't have friends like that.  Stand back.  I get to go to Roscoe with Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  That's great.  I'm so happy you do that.  Once a year so far. 
[01:57:00]  It is beautiful, isn't it?  But I love it.  I haven't caught anything officially.  I was dragging my pole once and I caught a fish by accident.  I promise you, take yourself to Montana.  Yeah.  Big sky country.  You get a great guide.  And it's just, it's indescribable.  To die for.  To die for.  All right.  So we have to...  Thank you, gentlemen.  Henry, thanks so much.  And we'll be back.  We have D.L. Hughley.  Yes.  And Henry, please come back and see us again.  You know I will.  All right.  Perfect.  You know I will. 
[01:57:30]  And I'll see you in Atlanta.  Yes.  We'll go to the Italian restaurant together.  Yeah.  Antica Posta.  Ah.  Is the name of the restaurant.  Antica Posta.  Okay.  In Buck's Head.  And that's where I'm going to be working, I think.  And Henry's active on Twitter.  So it's H Winkler 4.  4.  The number 4 real.  H Winkler 4 real.  You don't spell out 4.  Yeah.  We'll Twitter him and you can see it tomorrow.  Yeah.  We'll take a couple pictures.  We'll tweet them and we'll be good.  Henry Winkler.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  Fuck you. 
[01:58:00]  This FU goes out to Van Halen for that god awful new song they released.  It's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it.  Hey, Van Halen.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.

Fuck you.  I'm going to give a big fuck you to horse face, chicklet tooth, Rich Voss and his gum  chewing while he's on the mic.  No one wants to sit and listen to you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smacking his fucking horse lips.  All right.  So go eat some oats and fuck you.

[02:00:00]  He put us on our best behavior.  There's very few guests, Ant, that put us on our best behavior. 
[02:00:30]  Where you just don't feel like going there.  Yeah, he was a nice guy.  It's very rare.  Jimmy, I was saying, there's very few guests that put you on your best behavior and you don't feel like going there.  You know, going for that little bit of shock or that edge, you know?  I don't like him at all.  Kevin from Connecticut writes, I'm a big fan of Henry.  Great interview.  Smoke pants from Jersey.  Wow, he made you fucking assholes sound nice. 
[02:01:00]  And then DJ Ain't a Lightbulb.  I was reading his during the break.  DJ Ain't a Lightbulb.  I was fucking howling.  He writes, holy Christ, Henry Winkler might be the nicest person who's ever lived.  Right?  Yeah, you don't want to.  It's weird.  Guys like that, I'm comfortable being respectful of what they are doing and not cursing or, you know.  Yeah.  It's just, he is who he is.  But my point is, it's very rare.  There's not many guys that will put you into that place.  This is true.  And he's one of those guys.  And I can't even think of a second guy that has done that to us. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Someone that was really nice where we decided just to fucking be normal.  Pat Cooper?  Pat Cooper.  To just be normal.  You know what I mean?  Like, forget about the mics and the radio and just go, you know what?  Yeah.  If I was in a coffee shop, this is how I would talk to the guy.  Yeah.  I was amazed that he did that to me.  That second appearance at Pontiac Stadium.  Wow.  He signed for 181,000 people in two days.  That's crazy.  I mean, that's, what do you do?  Exactly.  Like, he wasn't, I should ask what he did.  I don't remember.  Well, he certainly didn't sign for 181,000. 
[02:02:00]  So that was more like, you know, waving and saying hi and a few hates.  Oh, yeah.  It's like when I saw Batman and Robin at the Walt Whitman Mall.  They just stood up there in the parking lot on the back of a truck.  Was it really them?  Yes, it was them.  And it was a bunch of people standing around in the parking lot.  And I couldn't see them.  I was getting crushed.  And I started crying.  And my father called me a faggot because I was crying in front of Batman and Robin. 
[02:02:30]  Because I was.  I was crying.  I was like, ah.  Shut up.  Stop crying.  What the fuck are you crying for?  Oh, that's hilarious.  Like, yeah.  But you had a legit reason.  You were getting squished.  I probably wasn't.  Huh?  But I probably thought I was gonna.  So I just went fucking crazy.  D.L. Hughley.  D.L., how you doing, man?  You always know when D.L. has arrived.  Yes.  The beard.  Oh, yeah.  He's gone.  Mountain man.  I have to explain.  It was for Patrice.  Mountain man.  The whole Patrice thing.  Well, that's when it started.  Why, you wanted to do something you know he would have laughed at? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Started out as a Patrice thing, and now I just got shaved.  That whole Tom Hanks movie, what did he do?  Yeah, yeah.  Cast Away.  Cast Away.  Right.  I'm not growing this to look pretty.  I just decided to grow an ugly beard.  You scared the shit out of me.  That could.  Yeah.  I know.  I like that.  D.L. is the best smelling guy in comedy.  Yeah, you really know how to wear some shit there.  Once again, I'm like a swooning fairy when he walks in.  He smells great.  You know, we can't catch up.  We can't keep up with you because your last cologne that drove me and Jimmy nuts, I finally 
[02:03:30]  got.  Oh, yeah.  And him and his wife got it for me for Christmas.  Oh, yeah.  Because she was, yeah.  Well, he liked it because it has.  I liked it because she, meaning Jimmy.  It's good.  Yeah, it's great.  Jimmy liked it, too.  It has hashish in it.  Does it?  Yes.  Oh, there you go.  It was the dried down hashish.  And you're in Ria.  I'm just sober.  Yeah, 25 years.  What was it called?  Black.  Black Afgano.  Afgano, yeah.  See, we finally got that and now I'm smelling something new on you.  And this shit is so weird.  It's called Seven Veils. 
[02:04:00]  It's got some vanilla in it.  It smells a little vanilla in it.  All on Seven V-A-I-L-S.  Uh-oh.  Seven Veils.  That's good.  So how have you guys been, man?  We're good.  I tried to get in contact with you after the Patrice thing.  That just sucked.  Still sucked.  Yes.  It still sucks.  Bad.  Yeah, he was a funny motherfucker.  He really was.  And a good man.  You guys know each other?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He was my favorite.  Patrice did.  He was my favorite.  I remember after Don Imus, he called. 
[02:04:30]  And he was like, man, fuck them people.  Right on, man.  He was a good dude.  All after you stuck up for Imus.  Mm-hmm.  You were one of the few.  We stuck up for Imus.  And I remember D.L. did.  And I can't give you another name.  Especially radio guys.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Right.  You gotta stick up for this.  Who really?  And now he's a bigger dick than he was before now.  Imus?  Yeah.  Well, now he doesn't care.  Yeah.  I think he's probably, well, he has prostate cancer. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  And he's not treating it.  Is he really?  He's not treating it.  Why?  Plus, they told my father that.  What?  They said you could not treat it.  No, he decided not to treat it.  Yeah, but that's one of the options.  That's like an option, especially if you're a little up there in years.  What do you got, 70-something?  Yeah.  He's probably...  72?  Yeah.  Late 60s, early 70s.  My father's 74.  They said one of the options, three of the options.  You can radiate it, you can cut it out, or you can do nothing.  And they can just measure it.  Because it's a race against, like, chances are... 
[02:05:30]  Right.  The old age might get him.  How long can you live with it, though?  Forever.  My...  Not forever, obviously, but my wife's father and grandfather got diagnosed at 70-something,  lived to 94, and had it that whole time.  Because it's really small.  Like, if you get it in your 40s, 50s, then it's kind of...  It's tougher, because it's more virulent.  And it's funny, because remember, I don't remember if I did it, but, like, about four years 
[02:06:00]  ago, I was going through, like, they thought I had something.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  All scary as fuck.  You know, it's a comic that had it, and he's 42.  Prostate cancer?  And they took it out.  They took his prostate out.  Damn.  No, I don't know.  You know him.  I don't want to say.  Oh, you're on the camera.  I can't remember.  You got to work that prostate.  You know?  You got to keep it pumping.  That's what they say.  Keep it pumping.  Like a muscle.  Right.  Whether you're doing it yourself or using a friend.  Right.  You know, you got to keep fluid going through that fucking... 
[02:06:30]  You got to fire up some practice rounds.  It's like leaving a toilet without flushing it for a while, you know?  It gets a little gamey.  Yeah, it backed up.  Yeah.  So, wait.  Can he still get rods?  Can you still get a rod?  The stuff now is so...  It's all cyber knife, they call it.  Because it used to be they'd just rip shit out.  And hope for the best.  Look, I don't think he needs this.  You'll live.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what we can promise you, but...  Cyber knifing, they call it?  Yeah, the cyber knife.  My old man just had it, and it's so precise. 
[02:07:00]  Like, you don't lose any very...  Like, one or two percent of people lose sex with fun.  But when you're 80, we can't tell if that's fucking life.  Yeah.  Maybe that's just what you were doing, yeah.  The road you were on to.  Yeah, they do, like, laparoscopic surgery now.  That's really it.  They just poke one little hole in and then do everything by a little fucking thing that you used to pick up a nut with when you drop it when you're working on your car.  That little thing.  Yeah, and they do a whole operation with those things.  Yeah, you see two people with little holes right here on their knees. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And no advantages.  It would have been a scar from your shin up to the middle of your thigh.  Right.  And, yeah.  What made you think you had something?  You just wear it?  I went to the doctor.  And, uh, first I thought I got burned.  Like, because I, you know, I was like, oh, wow, somebody.  Oh, shit.  Somebody gave me something.  Something's happening.  And then, uh, so I went to the doctor and he, for a regular, regular physical, and my PSA was much higher.  Like, it's supposed to be, like, below four is what they say. 
[02:08:00]  And so it was 10.5.  Oh, shit.  So he said, wait a minute, something's going on.  So they sent me to a urologist.  And he said it's kind of boggy is what he used.  And that was two anal problems one day.  So I was a little sore.  Wow, man.  Yeah.  And then he said, well, I think, I'm pretty sure that it's prostatitis.  So they gave me this thing called, stuff called Levaquin.  And I took it for two weeks.  And I came back and it dropped from 10 to 8.  And he said, okay, that's a promising sign.  Because generally, nothing can make your PSA go down except cancer, except treatments or, you know, cancer treatments. 
[02:08:30]  Or some kind of treatment.  So I kept taking it and dropped it all the way down to one.  And below one now.  Oh, damn.  And so they were certain it was prostatitis.  But then they had to do a biopsy.  Yeah.  It's the most painful shit ever.  What do they do with the biopsy?  They have to go in and just scrape a piece off?  No.  I told the story because the same shit happened to me.  I went through the exact same thing you just described.  Scared out of my fucking mind.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they went in and had to take, you know, some biopsies.  And did you wince a little bit? 
[02:09:00]  Wince?  I almost had tears in my eyes.  Not almost.  Saying goodbye?  And the doctor was actually patting my back.  Had his finger up his ass.  Right.  Patting my back to comfort me because that was some fluid.  With his chest.  And fluid shot out of my pee hole.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's called cumming.  No, no, no.  He said it wasn't, though.  It was just the fluid part.  It doesn't end.  Maybe that's what they said.  Yeah, I'll talk about it on some other.  I didn't give my urologist a facial, but I'm just saying.  And then you feel like you're shitting or have to pee really bad for about 12 to 16 straight hours. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, man.  You go, how could anybody want to do anything that is this all the time?  Yeah, yeah.  It was so uncomfortable.  It's uncomfortable and it's emasculating.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's very close.  Yeah.  Just getting the exam itself, just getting a finger up there so he could check it out. 
[02:10:00]  I remember driving home after that and I go to sit in my car and just felt squishy.  Yes, you can.  You think how the chick feels when she's going home in the morning.  Well, the best is when they give you a bunch of paper towels and you gotta clean up.  Now clean up and get out of here.  I'm done with you.  But did you, I talked about this a couple of years ago, but I want to see if it happened to you.  The first time you had sex, did he warn you there might be a little blood in it?  Yeah, and you know what happened?  The first time I had it.  It scared the living shit out of me.  I thought it was in a vampire movie. 
[02:10:30]  The first time I peed, it was just pure red.  And I was like, oh my, I'm dying.  Beat red.  It was hard.  But he warned me and, man, that came flying out.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Did you faint?  Did you feel like you were going to faint?  I felt immediately that something was wrong.  I called the urologist and he started laughing.  Because they go through that shit and you're like, I don't know if this is not funny.  But he was supposed to tell you there was going to be blood.  But my guy told me.  He didn't tell me.  Oh, shit.  And then, were you on Levaquin?  I forget now, to be honest with you. 
[02:11:00]  Probably.  I was on something.  For 12 weeks, right?  For a long time.  Wow.  Yeah, because the prostate is so small and so deep that it has no blood flow.  So you have to just, oh, it's fucking horrible, man.  Jesus.  You have to keep taking it.  And then, every once in a while, stress or, like, strange ass could make it flare up.  It could make it flare up.  So you're susceptible.  But it doesn't make you any more susceptible to prostate cancer.  It's just scary.  But you're a young guy, so it had to be really scary back then.  You just told my story. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you had the exact same fucking thing.  Oh, man.  It's horrible.  And then when they first call you, like.  They're snapping when they're hitting the prostate to get some samples.  What do they do?  They cut a piece of it off?  It almost feels like you're getting electrocuted for a split second.  How many have to take a different quadrants?  He goes, we're almost done.  I think he took six to eight.  Is that all right?  How did they get to it, though?  What a big fucking thing that hurts your ass.  But if the thing is in your intestine.  But I'm that dude that had to go.  People had to go in through the penis to get.  Fuck that. 
[02:12:00]  With the snippers?  Because they have interstitial something somewhere.  So they have to.  This is horrible.  See, I don't know.  How do they get through the intestinal wall to get to the prostate?  I really don't know.  Because if they shove something in your ass, to get a piece of the prostate out,  you've got to go through the intestinal wall because it's not hanging out up your ass.  I felt that class.  They feel your prostate through your intestines when they shove a finger up your ass.  I guess there's some kind of needle going all the way through or something.  Oh, a biopsy needle.  Yes, a needle biopsy.  Okay, a needle biopsy.  I mean, it sounds like a rubber band. 
[02:12:30]  Like, it just snaps.  And then you feel this excruciating pain.  It's painful, humiliating, scary.  It's like working at XM.  You feel it everywhere.  In your ass.  In your asshole.  Ass, stomach.  You probably get, like, a stomach ache.  Back.  Yeah.  Legs.  Damn, like, you've got to take a pet shit.  I thought I was going to black out.  Really?  God, this is fucked up.  I thought I was going to black out.  I'm like, oh.  Aren't you just saying to yourself, like, this is for fucking old guys.  Yeah.  What the fuck am I doing here?  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, man.  How do you get prostatitis?  What is that?  Just an infection?  It could be an infection.  It could be.  Mostly, it's probably some kind of shit you did.  Something crawled back.  Something didn't take the whole train home.  Something that didn't get off and it stopped.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  It was horrible, man.  And it is, that in itself is, you know something's wrong, like, at that point.  Because you, did your back hurt?  Like, it was hard to pee and stuff like that?  Oh, God. 
[02:13:30]  No.  You did nothing?  No.  What, he just did a checkup?  He found a lump.  Check up and.  And then it turned out, I guess it was an infection or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He, mine, he just.  I went in, you know, and he's putting a finger at me and I'm thinking, you know, all the jokes,  like, and I turned around and saw his face.  I'm like, oh, great.  Right, right, right, right, right.  Right away, I saw his face.  Mine was normal, but the PSA was high.  Right.  And then, um, he, the next morning, like, literally, I'm not bullshitting, at 5.30 in  the morning, my doctor goes, and he goes, I don't want to alarm you. 
[02:14:00]  I'm like, what the fuck, he just did.  Oh, fuck yeah, he just did, right?  Of course.  What's the point of this?  Yeah.  Like, and then he said, I don't think it's anything to it, but how soon can you get to the  urologist, and I'm like, I'm going out of town, he goes, can you go today?  Wow, man.  I go, yeah, well, good, because I made you an appointment at 9.  That's, like, horrible.  Yeah.  And I'm waiting for results.  We all could relate to this shit.  And my guy goes on vacation.  Yeah.  So instead of getting the results, I don't remember exactly, but maybe two days later, 
[02:14:30]  I had to wait about 10 days.  I was out of my fucking mind.  Because he was on vacation.  I'm like, really, there's no other person that could read this shit for me?  Right now?  Well, here's what I got.  Here's the worst thing.  You ever had the nurse call you with her cryptic ass on the results?  And then they always say, I can't discuss it.  The doctor will have to.  Right.  That's fucking.  Do you know, for AIDS tests, I've done that, and I've talked to the nurse, and she goes,  your results are in.  I'm like, I couldn't get in.  And she goes, I can't get the results over the phone.  I go, all right, look, I have a date tonight. 
[02:15:00]  I've said that.  I'm like.  You put it on her.  I said, should I enjoy this date?  And she went, you should enjoy it.  And that let me know I was okay.  That's exactly how that happened.  Only Jim Norris can come in.  Hey, listen.  You got to grease their.  When I get the date.  When I get, like, x-rays, MRIs, any of that shit, you got to grease those guys.  Yeah.  Because they've seen so many, they know right away.  Right.  Well, you can pay those guys?  Well, I'm more joking.  But, I mean, you kind of, you work them a little bit. 
[02:15:30]  And they go, well, I'm not supposed to tell you.  And you work your way around.  And they go, yeah, you're totally.  I've had.  Your doctor's going to tell you you're totally fine.  Right.  But you can't take my word for it.  Right, right.  Because, you know, it's all good.  It's all fucking a gimmick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's all, like.  They pass you on one guy to another to another.  And there's probably kickbacks, I'm sure, down the line.  The doctor that recommended you to go to another guy.  That other guy's got to kick something back to the initial doctor.  It's horrible.  And you know what scares me?  Like, Patrice scares me. 
[02:16:00]  Like, when that happened to him.  Yeah.  That obviously scares me.  Are you diabetic?  No, I never was.  I never had been.  But what happened was, you can, you can.  Like, I'm being on the road and eating crazy.  You can type two diabetes.  What, sedentary lifestyle and cheaty food?  You can do that to yourself.  You can do it to yourself.  And so, and it's so easy.  It's like three or four people that I know what a variation.  Now, he was the most extreme case.  But the variation that happened to me, they just kind of got sick. 
[02:16:30]  And one dude didn't know he had anything.  And he kept passing out, peeing on himself.  Gee.  And it was diabetes.  He had no idea.  And you just didn't ever even know.  And black people, that's like our thing.  That's our thing.  That's a sore throat.  Right.  That's like what happened.  Yeah.  I remember once my mother was cooking.  And I said, Mom, I don't want to.  Look, everything was fucking fat and sugar.  And I go, I don't want to eat that.  And she goes, oh, you too good for high blood pressure? 
[02:17:00]  I actually hope I am too good for high blood pressure.  Oh, he got the sweet blood.  What?  They call it the sugar.  That's the sugar.  That sounds nice, though.  That sounds like something.  Oh, he's got the sugar.  That's really funny.  Just because you've got to lose an eye to get it.  Man, you know what?  I'm obsessed.  I'm obsessed.  And I'm obsessed with these Republican debates.  Yeah.  They are like, I'm DVRing.  You know, I don't think the president was going to win. 
[02:17:30]  But they might as well have.  He must have asked for some dumbasses for Christmas.  You couldn't deliver the dumb shit that they do.  Like, they can't believe that they can win like this.  It really is astounding.  Especially how they're beating the shit out of each other.  And they just don't come across as very presidential.  No.  They don't even come across as very human.  Like, Newt Gingrich, his woman comes out and basically says, we had open marriage. 
[02:18:00]  Then he brags all the time.  That's not a fucking president.  That's a rapper, is what that is.  Like, I might not vote for you, but I'm sure I'll buy on your first album.  And then at the same time, you have the president singing Let's Stay Together, a song about fidelity.  And then he's singing I Got Holes in Different Area Coaches.  Like, the black dude is the symbol for morality and monogamy.  That's the fucking...  That happened.  Yeah, wait a minute.  This country's gone topsy-turvy. 
[02:18:30]  I missed D.L. Hughley.  It was CNN, right?  Uh-huh.  God damn, that was a good show.  I had a good time.  You know what?  You made it fun, man.  It was a lot of fun.  But it was fun.  Only, you guys, you know, you can relate to this.  These cats made it so mysterious.  Like, these...  You can have a point of view.  Your point of view can be informed by your experience.  All it is is informed by your experiences.  And, like, to me, I just...  I never got why it was so...  Like, Wolf Blitzer and all these cats would be real serious. 
[02:19:00]  And nobody watches you.  Nobody cares about how fucking serious you are.  Yeah.  Like, good that you're serious, but no one cares.  What the fuck are you saying?  Right.  So, what the...  Just like when Herman Cain was running out of the best shit ever.  Oh, yeah.  How great was that?  Herman was great.  Oh, my God.  I miss him.  I actually do, too.  I kind of miss the guy now.  Now, you know what's funny?  I would never vote for him, but I would rather hang out with him than Obama.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, Obama's going to read a book and play Scrabble with his family.  He's a Harvard nerd.  He's a nerd.  We've said it many times on the show.  People got to understand that.  Herman Cain, pizza? 
[02:19:30]  Jam your fingers at her?  Right.  Fucking Herman Cain rules.  His greasy pizza fingers going in there.  You want a job?  Why don't you pop this in your mouth?  We'll talk about it.  That's exactly what I would do if I was Herman Cain.  You know, I know...  Any dude that blinks that much when he talks is lying.  He is fucking...  And it would have been...  Like, to me, it would have been great.  Like, people are going, oh, if two qualified black dudes, bright, urbane, intellectual, bright dudes, black men had had, you know, a difference of political ideology, I would have been... 
[02:20:00]  It would have been a hard decision to make.  Like, then I would have been like, wow, it's two dudes that are exposing different viewpoints and they're both equally as bright.  But Herman Cain was the...  He literally made me miss Sarah Payne.  Like, I like...  It is that I don't like black Republicans.  I just never see any.  I, like, wonder...  They are rare.  Only four years.  Every four...  Like, leap year.  Yeah, yeah.  They come out of hiding.  Where do they store them?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you open the shed and dust them off and let them adjust to the light. 
[02:20:30]  I love when Republicans are giving a speech and they talk about, you know, we need diversity and they just start touching on a racial issue and the camera is going wild.  Like, yeah, the camera is going like the price is right when they're trying to find the name they just called.  And it's like, there, there, there.  Third row back.  Six over.  Get her.  And there's some woman going, I love this man.  And they just get the camera on her.  And the one woman in the whole crowd.  And the camera swinging on the jet.  And then they get the one guy that's serving a drink. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, we thought...  Yeah, yeah.  Wait a minute.  He's got a tray and some cocktails.  Shit.  What do you got on Mitt Romney?  You know what?  I just don't know why you're ashamed that you make that much money.  He makes a lot of money.  Why are you ashamed?  If you didn't...  I know cats that do illegal shit and unhappy.  I don't think he's ashamed.  I think he really wants to tell everyone how rich he is.  No.  But he also knows it'll hurt him.  No, I...  He seems like that type of guy, like, I really do want to tell you how about a rich motherfucker.  I think that he's not comfortable being around humans.  Like, he's not comfortable. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I agree.  And I think guys like that...  You get the sense that he's not confrontational.  Yeah.  Like, he probably had people fire people.  Mm-hmm.  Like, he...  So, he's just not...  He wasn't a hatchet man.  No, he's not a hatchet man.  But he...  He benefits...  And he looks...  And he looks so...  Like, if I were worth a quarter of a billion dollars, I would walk around my tax returns in a fucking T-shirt.  Like, you wouldn't know.  So, black people go broke trying to prove we have money.  I would make my tax return out of some fucking rims.  Are you crazy? 
[02:22:00]  I don't...  And I like...  Like, I love Ron Paul.  I think he's a, you know, incredibly principled man.  But...  Because it's cool when an 80-year-old dude says he wants to smoke weed and stop war.  That's always...  But when an 80-year-old dude is the answer, we've got to change the question.  What do you think about him as a vice...  Because I thought they have a shot if they have...  Because I like Ron Paul, too.  But he is old.  And I wonder if him as a vice president might not be as bad.  I just think he doesn't...  He just doesn't fit the American...  Like...  Yeah, he's too...  He's too out there for the general public. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, he's going to fall short for the general public.  Not for me.  No, no.  Believe me, anarchy at this point isn't too out there for me.  Right, right.  I'm ready.  But he's going to fall short.  They're not going to be brave enough to make that move.  Well, plus he doesn't...  Like, he doesn't look like a president.  Right.  No, no, no.  He might be a right fit for America, but he should get a suit to fit.  Yeah.  He should be a bean counter, like, in the 50th level below the Pentagon somewhere.  I like him.  I like...  The Santorum is just fucking...  It's dumb.  He comes off like a...  He's hateable.  He almost comes off as a Dan Quail-ish kind of thing. 
[02:23:00]  But that...  He's trying to convince everyone he's mature enough to be the president.  But he's not.  You don't have to fucking wear a sweater vest to be...  But listen to him.  He's just trying to convince everyone.  No, I can do this.  You know what's funny?  Like, when Newt Gingrich said that, you know, you need to, you know, take the jobs from janitors  and give them...  Like, my father was a janitor.  Raised four kids as a janitor.  And a lot of the cats that I grew...  Left on my streets, father, were janitors.  They worked maintenance.  Right.  No, so if you want to give us their jobs, what the fuck would we do with them? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Like, the quickest...  And you're supposed to love the family.  But the quickest way to make a black man leave is to give his job to his kids.  See how long he stays around.  Give his job.  And who the fuck wants their son, like, teach him how to work?  Who the fuck wants to teach their son to be a janitor?  It's a thankless fucking job.  Nobody cares about it.  I didn't get it.  It's just...  And I'm just obsessed with this whole Joe Paterno thing.  I look...  Did you...  How mean people were when he died?  Yeah.  Like, that's karma. 
[02:24:00]  This motherfucker was 80 years...  85 years old.  If you can live 85 years old, have your teeth, a great job, only suffer for two months, who  I got the fuck to get that deal, huh?  Some kids.  Yeah, there's no karma there.  You're right.  If somebody said, right now, you can live to 85 years old, keep your fucking wits about  you.  Only suffer for a month and a half.  Right.  With a crazy scandal that's been going on a long fucking time.  What would you...  Right?  Yeah.  Sounds like a good enough deal.  You take that deal right now.  Hell fucking yeah.  I don't care.  I was the only reason I...  And I was very sad.  I've never been a Penn State fan, but I think he's a great dude. 
[02:24:30]  You let one kid get through, and then all of a sudden you are fucking the devil.  I don't get it.  Apparently so.  You let one dude tell somebody he's not sitting down on the table.  Yeah, you don't really go to bat for the kid.  Man.  You know, you do the absolute minimum.  Minimum.  Like, you look on the milk card and go, I think I saw that guy.  I think I just saw him ask someone else to see him, too.  It's not my problem.  No more questions.  It's not my job description.  That's like witnessing a rape, and then he emailed somebody about it. 
[02:25:00]  You might want to check this out.  She's bleeding in the parking lot.  I don't think she's got much longer.  Yeah, I thought he was a douche.  He was.  But he was the kind of institutional guy where he wanted to protect his institution.  Like, churches want to protect the church more than they want to do the people.  Like, institutions.  And the fucked up thing for me is that when we was growing up, they said, if you want  to be a positive member of society, you go to church, you play sports, and you go to  school.  Now, between Catholic priests, Penn State, and Syracuse, I take my chances on the street. 
[02:25:30]  It's safer there.  Like, when a dope dealer tries to fuck me, it's just out my money.  And what about the kid who was 13?  Say he was molested from 13 until 28.  If you've got a coach finally, then you've got a fucking boyfriend.  That's really.  Yeah, that at some point becomes a relationship.  That's not abuse anymore.  Was it Jimmy who said, if you have to drive yourself?  Yeah.  That was your relationship?  What a great line.  Drive to your own molesting.  What a great fucking line.  If you have to drive yourself, it's a really molestation.  If you can't get molested for a while because you don't have easy pass.  Right. 
[02:26:00]  You're stuck in traffic.  Yeah, that was Jimmy.  What a great line.  Fuck.  And you know what's, like, because when I grew up, it was cats in the neighborhood.  Like, it was just one cat in this neighborhood and goes, like, I'm seven years old.  And he goes, I want to suck your dick.  And I go, hmm, that ain't right.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you know at a certain point that, as soon as you take this knife away from my throat,  I'm telling you, you don't understand, the authorities will be getting called.  Did he really say that to you?  He really said it.  Like, I'm seven years old.  How old was he?  He was 20, 20-something.  Jesus.  And he goes.  He was honest. 
[02:26:30]  Like, I, let me suck your dick.  And I'm like, seven.  I have no icons.  I don't even know.  Like, I only pee out of this thing.  I don't understand what it used to me.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you mean?  Why would you want to do that?  Like, it was like that.  And I go, nah, I don't think.  Nah, I'm going to.  And I'm telling.  Yeah, yeah.  You got in trouble?  And I told the cats in our neighborhood, and they whipped his ass.  Wow, yeah.  I said, man, this dude said, could he suck my dick?  And he goes, this mother, he's lying.  And I go, and the dude goes, he didn't even know.  He don't even know what a dick is.  Oh, shit. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And so they'd be, but I just don't get how people allow, like, don't get that that's  at a certain point not true.  Yeah.  Well, he started wrong anyway.  Something, he should have just said, look, can I just tug on that a little bit?  And you might have been like, all right, because people use their hands, but even my mouth  is just too creepy.  He overshot the market.  Right, right, right.  The first time.  You got to warm it up.  Yeah.  You don't fucking, you got to take a girl to dinner first.  You don't just go, hi, can I fuck you?  The first time you did get a blowjob, just think back and go, damn, I should have taken  my mother.  This is pretty good. 
[02:27:30]  I was like, hey, you know what?  Fuck.  This is pretty good.  I just, yeah, it's just so much weird shit.  And the thing that they take advantage, like people get mad at the, at the, at, like when  you drop your kids off, because they take advantage of poor kids.  Yeah, yeah.  It's mothers who want their children to get, you know, around positive male role models  and they drop them off unsupervised.  Like they leave the lambs to fucking slaughter.  Yeah.  And if you don't, like, shouldn't you be in tune enough with your children to know, like,  that something's not right? 
[02:28:00]  Like you.  You'd think, yeah, right.  You would think, but it's happening too much.  I think it's happening more because people just turn their children off.  Like my mother would never let us, like they had to know, like I have two daughters and  I love them and I hang out with them and you have to, think about having daughters, you  have to listen to them, which is kind of weird because when you listen to a woman, usually  when I listen to a woman, something in it for me, some blowjob or food, but I'm just listening  to them so they feel good about themselves.  Yeah.  So I go out to dinner with my, with my two daughters and I, like oysters on the half show 
[02:28:30]  and I give.  How old are they?  The 20 and 24.  What?  Yeah.  I know.  We've talked about it before.  You don't look like you have a 24 year old.  Yeah.  Oh man.  And you certainly don't act like that.  Oh man.  And so we had to dinner and I offered my youngest daughter something.  She goes, no daddy, I don't like the way they feel going down my throat.  And I was so proud.  Yeah.  It made me so happy.  And then my oldest daughter went, I love them.  And I was like, oh shit.  Oh no. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, you ho.  You failed the task.  Oh no.  Oh man.  It is a.  That's gotta be something when you just, you know, at some point they become women.  Yeah.  And you gotta know like, you look, I don't know any details.  I don't want to know.  So, but she's gotta be fucking.  Yeah, she has to be.  Like, I, I, you're a job.  I, I, you know, you want them positive members of society.  You want them viable human beings.  At a certain point, it boils down to the fact you want your daughter to have as few dicks as possible. 
[02:29:30]  Like, that's just.  That's your goal.  Every dick just does more psychological damage.  It's like it's fucking me.  Because I don't want to wake up like, this true story, I was on a train, I was in Europe, I was on a train, we were on a tour bus, and on the tour bus they were, they had videos, right?  So, I woke up to Montana Fishburne.  And I, the first thing I thought was, if I, if somewhere some dudes were on a bus with a picture of my daughter, I would be with pimples on her ass. 
[02:30:00]  I would be mortified.  Like, I would, that would crush me.  That would be, that wouldn't.  We, we ended up talking to her.  Remember, guys?  That's right, she called in, yeah.  We felt so bad for her.  Because she looks like Laurence Fishburne.  Yeah.  Yeah, she does.  And something wasn't right about that whole thing.  She does, Morpheus, yeah.  We let her off easy, because we were like, wow.  Daughters have such power to just fuck over their fathers if you do, if you make a mistake. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  If you make a mistake and send them off on another road, boy, they can come back and fuck a father over.  Yeah.  You got a son, too?  I got a son.  My son has Asperger's son.  But he just graduated.  He's the best kid I've ever met.  But it's hard.  Like, my wife, like, it's hard having a kid who you, because everybody thinks they want their son to be an athlete, or you want them to be a ladies' man, or you want them to be, like, he's just a good person.  But, and a, you know, one, like, literally, people say this all the time, he's an angel, none of that. 
[02:31:00]  He's just a good guy, a really good person.  Like, my son is, like, he calls me and goes, Dad, I love you.  Dad, are you all right?  Dad, like, my other daughters are like, they don't really care.  Yeah, whatever, right?  But, but I never felt the need to protect him.  Like, I never felt like, I never thought, you know, I thought he was going to get teased like everybody else does.  Yeah.  But I do a joke about that.  My wife used to be just upset.  And I'm like, you deal with shit your way. 
[02:31:30]  I deal with, like, he asked me when he, when he graduated, he asked me to give the commencement address at his graduation, which I, and I felt horrible because I never even got out of high school.  So, why would I, like, I feel like a hypocrite.  Listen, kids, take advantage of your education or it ain't going to work out for you.  Put my Mercedes around, like I was saying.  But, so, but now the thing is, it's more socially, but now he, like, takes Krav Maga, and he's a Krav Maga instructor, the most fit dude I ever, I've ever seen. 
[02:32:00]  Like, muscles everywhere, really thin, but can't get any pussy.  Oh, shit.  Can't get any pussy.  What's it called?  Has no game.  Has no, like, has no, like, what does that make you do?  What is that, it's like you stand too close, you talk, like, it's a social thing, you know, you know, you're a little, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  How old is he?  He's 23.  Do they say, does someone with Asperger say things that are harsh, or do you not know that, like, if someone's fat, well, you go, like, you know, wow, you're pretty fat.  They don't know that.  They don't know that that's, they don't, they don't, they have no, like, bullshit in them. 
[02:32:30]  Like, if you tell them something, they'll literally believe it.  Holy shit.  They'll literally believe it.  So what is the, how do you know someone has that, or someone's not just.  Well, you get, like, a lot of people, you don't make, like, and they're really task oriented, like if it's, like, they did a lot of the Blackberry application, because you can just point them and they'll do exactly that thing.  Wow.  And so, oh, they'll have the same kind of, like, he goes to cry with God five times, like three, four times a day.  Wow.  Like, he's obsessed with it. 
[02:33:00]  So he doesn't, like, they fixate on one thing and they kind of, and so I told him, I said, no, you ain't gonna get no busy just being, it's just at the gym all the time.  It's just not gonna.  So he did get some one time, but he got it from an older, this is, my wife got upset.  And he came home and he said, he said, he came home and he said, I did it.  And this was, like, five months ago.  Oh, no.  And I go, what?  And he said, I had sex.  As I said, how was it?  He said, I used three rubbers.  And I went, oh, man, I'm so proud. 
[02:33:30]  He went, I was so nervous.  I kept, you know, taking them.  I'm like, so I thought it was gonna be a great story, but it ended up being fucked up.  And then my, my, he's telling me and my wife the story.  Oh, shit.  And he, he, the woman was from Switzerland or Finland.  She's 35 years old.  She's just hot.  Black dude who is fit and incredible guy.  So she gives him some.  And, you know, and I said, you know how sweet that is?  Because she knew it was his first time.  You know how sweet that is that a woman would know that you, like, because I'm just glad 
[02:34:00]  it wasn't like a ghetto chick that went, you can't fuck?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  You can't fuck.  You know, like.  Yeah, you need a confidence boost that first time, man.  Instead of a ghetto rap.  A layup that first time.  Yeah, yeah.  A layup.  He's gotta work his way up to a ghetto rap.  God, you gotta make your way up to a hood rat.  You can't be.  Bring it, daddy.  You don't need that shit in your life.  What the fuck you did you're giving me?  What the fuck is that shit?  Oh, man.  And I was, and my wife actually said, you should call her and thank her. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, shit.  I was like, am I hearing this?  Like, is this protocol?  What the fuck is.  Like, he could talk to us about anything and does.  He could talk to literate about anything.  And, and, and, and, and, but he's, he's at that age where, like, he's, my wife goes, he's  mad all the time.  I was like, cause he's not fucking.  That's what, that's what guys do.  Right.  They get mad.  You're mad.  He said, he, every time I say something to me, he's snapping.  I said, I, you should let me hire him a hooker. 
[02:35:00]  Like, really, like, like, and not even like, like, kind of like, not let him know.  Like, like on cable guy, like not let him know.  Yeah.  Kind of just a girlfriend experience.  Right.  A night, you know, he should, he should, at a certain point, he just has to get off or  he'll kill somebody.  Plus, the thing is, if he gets a hooker, he doesn't know, he might fall in love with  her because she'll be not, like a real good escort really makes you feel loved.  And he might go like, I want to see you again.  And then all of a sudden.  That could be a problem.  No, but then that could be expensive, though. 
[02:35:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  That's what you would have to tell him.  You might have to build in a back story or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, she should get on a plane the next day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  She's got me by train.  I don't know, son.  You know what?  That Hughley bank account could probably work for him.  Oh, God, yeah.  Just wave that around to get the chicks.  That's what I'm saying.  Son, we've got a car.  Fucking, I would, I would, I would have so many, uh, STDs when I was, I would literally  be, I would keep antibiotics on an IV.  Yeah.  Yeah, put in a Tic Tac, uh, container. 
[02:36:00]  Does he live on his own?  No.  Can he someday?  Oh, yeah, obviously.  Yeah.  He can do.  Well, we don't know much about that.  He's the, literally, he could do anything.  The thing about him, like, I remember when he wanted to go, my wife wanted him to go off  to college.  I'm like, this dude doesn't even know his address.  So why would I let him go off to college?  You know, college is crazy, because a lot of people go crazy anyway, and first you get  your first, uh, I, I want him to be in his first relationship and get his heart broken,  and then he can leave.  Oh, right.  Because.  Got to be close to home base when that happens. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Because everybody's going to get their heart broken.  Yeah.  And you're going to be devastated and fucked off and think all kinds of crazy thoughts.  And if you're by yourself.  Yeah.  You know, I, that's what I'm thinking.  I like, it isn't getting, it isn't getting ass.  It's that getting ass, falling in love with it, and having to fuck your friend.  That's.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good one.  That's when you need your father.  That's a bad one right there.  So, yeah, because, because he's going to, it's going to happen.  You need your familiar bed to cry on.  That's, that's the last time you need your father.  Right, right. 
[02:37:00]  That's the last time you need dad.  That's that last one, and then you move on.  Yeah.  Dad, I made it through.  Thank you, and take it easy.  And you're never the same after that.  No.  A little piece of your soul is gone.  You've been jaded.  Oh, we talked about this.  A little part of the innocence, a little part of your, this holding,  a woman up on a pedestal thing.  It's like, fuck you.  It kind of goes away.  Yeah.  But that happened to me in the, I was in the seventh grade, this girl named  Captain, I don't want to say her last name, but I'm in the seventh grade,  and we had to go, we all rode on school buses.  It was the seventh graders in the front, eighth graders in the back, 
[02:37:30]  ninth graders in the middle, and it was a song called Gloria,  for not your Gloria, because we discussed how you guys have different songs.  Yeah, of course.  But this group called Enchantment, and it used to come on every day,  and you know, you know, a seventh grader, a ninth grader,  and she's so beautiful to me.  I would look back at her when the song was coming on,  and she would kind of smile, and everything would be cool.  And one day, man, and this went on for months,  and then one day I looked back, and she went,  what you looking at, motherfucker? 
[02:38:00]  Oh, shit.  Stop looking at me, you nappy-headed fucker.  Oh, you had this image in your head that you guys are building a relationship.  Oh, man.  And everybody laughed, and the bus driver tilts his mirror back.  That big, what the fuck are you doing, Mariette?  With his hand and gloves that drivers wear.  I mean, you can't even wear it.  It's all right, little man.  It'll be cool.  And then he started fucking her.  Like, that guy.  Oh, shit.  That guy.  No kidding.  But I was different from that time, like, from that minute on. 
[02:38:30]  I remember the first time I went, you know what?  Like, from that, all I did was love her.  Right.  That's all I did.  I didn't.  And the bus driver started fucking her?  Yeah, he was, like, 21 years old.  Oh, my God.  Where was that in CeeLo's video?  Well, not that day, but eventually.  I mean, he raised her, kind of like Woody Allen.  Yeah, yeah.  He stayed on the route till she was older.  I had that happen to me.  My best friend, one of those deals. 
[02:39:00]  I was going out with a girl, like, nine months.  And it was, what was it?  I guess ninth, tenth grade, something like that.  Probably tenth grade.  And all of a sudden, you know, I call her up.  She's not home, this, that, the other.  And I'm just, like, freaking out.  And found out she's just fucking my best friend.  Yeah.  And now, you know, it fucks things up with the best friend.  It fucks things up with her, obviously.  And I was just devastated to the point where I would just sit at home and just drink. 
[02:39:30]  I do that now, though.  Yeah.  Let me think.  What would I do different?  Yeah, maybe you never got over it.  I took, like, for no reason, would just drive my car in the woods and just, like, hit trees  with my car and get all pissed off.  Remember that feeling, though?  Really?  That's so crazy.  Is that when you took the bat?  That's a white, that's some white shit.  Let me take my car into the woods out on Long Island and just drive fast down the little  trail.  Is that when you took the bat?  Oh, oh, yeah.  And then I tried, I tried to, after, yeah, because this went on for weeks of just depression  and sadness. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  And I thought it would be a great idea.  Let me go into my garage with the Louisville Slugger.  Don't look at him.  And hit my arm, because if I break my arm, then she'll have sympathy for me and come  back to me.  This is the thinking of a fucking dumb 10th grader.  Are you, you, you, you're not bullshit, right?  I'm not bullshit, man.  I actually, but I couldn't, I couldn't close the deal.  Like, I'd swing and then, I'd hold up.  I'd go for the bunt, right?  When I hit, like, got close.  Right, right, right, right, right.  He's like, oh, he's squaring off for a bunch.  He bruised his wrist.  I bruised my fucking wrist. 
[02:40:30]  And it wouldn't have helped.  You didn't put it in a sling?  Yeah, and I did put it in a sling.  She's like, what happened?  Oh, yeah, I fell off of this.  I fucking was doing something manly.  Women, like, especially, like, they have, like, I have a friend, he's a really good friend  of mine, and his wife is just the most horrible fucking bitch I've ever  she's fucking horrible, man.  Like, he, she fucking another guy, and then they get back, he takes her back, and then  she's, and I'm like, at a certain point, women say they want a good guy, but if you're 
[02:41:00]  nice to them, you're getting fucked.  It's just really hard to not, like, my wife, like, is a wonderful woman, but at a certain  point, she understands I'm, you have to disappear for a couple of days.  You know, a relationship, a long-standing relationship is directly dependent on a woman's ability  to take some bullshit.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't, like, a man can't take bullshit, because then he's him-packed.  Yeah.  Then she thinks she can run over it. 
[02:41:30]  It has to be her that takes bullshit.  But they have something else that they get in the deal, too.  Yeah, they don't have to work.  You know, the bullshit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I, that's what you see, but you're right.  Like, they will fuck you over if you're too nice.  If you're too nice.  Yeah.  Like he said, man, what should I do?  I said, you should slap the fuck out of them.  You should literally-  Yeah.  So, I, you say whatever you want to say, not necessarily hitting a person.  Like, you don't have to do that.  Like, me and my wife were having an argument five months ago, and she woke me up to have 
[02:42:00]  this, uh, this argument that only fucking women can have.  And, and she started getting a little, like, and I'm like, hey, hey, girl, you're talking  to me like a man.  I said, now, at a certain point, you've made your point, and I've respected you and listened  to you.  Now, shut up.  Like, and I never talked to her like that.  Wow.  And she went right to sleep, and she said, and the next day, she's cooking, and she goes,  I, I, I just, you know, I'm sorry, I got a little busy.  You can't, at a certain point, this can only go bad, and you've made your point. 
[02:42:30]  Now, stop.  But you don't normally do that.  You, you're normally nice to her.  Normally, I, I'm, I'm, normally I just kind of just be quiet till she realizes I'm not,  I'm asleep, so, and, but this time, I'm like, this is enough.  Like, I don't, shut up.  The next morning, when, when she said that, did you get all like, yeah?  No, no.  Did you get all manly, like, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  That was the right move.  Because I, I just, I don't like to, she's my, I love her, but I don't, shut up.  But shut up.  But shut up.  I mean, even in the wild, uh, kingdom there, you see, uh, you know, 
[02:43:00]  occasionally that big lion is just laying there doing nothing.  Right.  The lioness will come over, give him like a nudge, and he'll fucking claw right at her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, that's him giving her a little shit.  Right, right.  And getting, keeping her, uh, you know, getting her to respect him a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that, I think that women, women are like animals.  Like, if you got a dog, that dog, every minute of that, your existence with him is trying to see who's in charge.  Well, if you, no, really, you let him eat first. 
[02:43:30]  You let him jump on the fucking couch.  You let him, all of it is about, you know, I'm in charge.  They don't, it's just instinctual.  They don't care.  Like, you think they love you, but open the fucking door and see if they, they won't stay.  They won't stay.  Because every minute of their existence or interaction with you is all about seeing, it's dominance, right?  It's seeing who's fucking in charge.  And I think women are like that.  Seeing who the pack leader is.  Right.  As Cesar would say.  Right, right, yeah.  I think women are like that.  I think that every minute, they're trying to see who has the reins in the relationship.  You said something in there that's important that I didn't want to skip over. 
[02:44:00]  And the argument always begins right when you're ready to fall asleep.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Why do they pick that time?  Yeah.  Why do they pick that time?  I think it's.  Because maybe they feel like we're weak.  I think you're more vulnerable at that point.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're speaking for many people.  That's when the arguments usually start.  Right when you're about to fucking close your eyes.  Or something like, or you're watching a game, and like it's something where you're not going  to be able to focus.  You can't just get, like, it's never right after I'm done working out. 
[02:44:30]  Right, right.  It's like when you're ready.  You're all ready.  Yeah, you're ready.  Endorphins.  I'm alert.  I'm super alert.  Let's do this.  Come on, bring it.  Let's do this.  I'm running through tires.  Come on.  Yeah.  It's fucking, it's never that time.  It's when you're very sleepy.  I've had a bottle of wine.  I'm fucking passing out.  I think we should talk about nothing.  Right, right.  Which proves they are smarter than us in the end.  But I have no.  Because we haven't figured that shit out.  I have no doubt.  She's, and the thing, my wife's very religious, and I don't go to church. 
[02:45:00]  Because I think at black churches, you only see gay dudes, women, and children.  Like, you never, if a straight dude going to church, it's to see how much busy can be.  Right.  Yeah, it's not there for the religion.  It's not there for the religion.  How did you guys get together with that?  I was.  You guys come from different walks of life, obviously.  Yeah, it was, and it's like, I grew up in LA, and she grew up in a little suburb called  Carson.  Yeah.  And she's, she went to college, and I didn't, and I instantly knew that I would marry her.  Instantly.  I got married as 20, 21.  Wow, man, yeah. 
[02:45:30]  So, and I knew I wasn't ready to get married, but I said, I'll never see another thing like  this again.  So I'll get ready.  Like, I knew that, I said, if I let her go, I'll never see anything like this again.  And have you?  No.  Yeah?  Never.  Wow, that's pretty amazing.  Like, I would never, like, if I was going to get married, I'd never marry another black  woman.  I would, like, be like a murderer.  I've done my time.  You've done it.  It's a Puerto Rican woman for me next year.  Oh, boy.  Like, if she's ever struck by lightning, I'm going right to the Bronx.  Good luck with that Puerto Rican thing. 
[02:46:00]  But the religious thing, does that get in the way?  Yeah.  In what ways?  Because she doesn't like that, like, if I say, God damn it, or if I, she's very religious.  Right.  Like, she's, she's not quite the religious right, but.  Is there certain movies or TV shows?  She wouldn't let the kids watch Harry Potter.  Oh, okay.  Like, you come to my house, she has angels painted on the door.  Remember growing up, Ant, the list, the Catholic Church would put out a list of movies  you weren't allowed to watch.  Movies that were condemned.  You couldn't even go see them.  No.  And we knew those were the ones we had to watch.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:46:30]  So that did, that backfired.  She just doesn't like, and she has these, these horrible fucking prayer meetings where,  like, her friends will, I'll come home and they'll be praying.  In your living room?  In my living room.  They'll have, like, these book meetings.  Like a Tupperware party.  Wow.  Yeah, a Tupperware party, but Jesus everywhere.  And it's.  You ever walk in mad, not known to, motherfucker, oh, hi.  Hey, how you doing?  I never, like, they'll always go, please come join us.  I'm like, no.  No.  I'm not, I don't care.  How does she deal with your comedy? 
[02:47:00]  She's got to be one of your biggest fans.  She is, but she doesn't, she wishes that I wouldn't do, like, some of the things I do.  And she wishes I wasn't so, like, she thinks I'm obstinate, and she thinks, like, that I'm, like, I'm not hateful,  because I, I generally, I honestly love, like, I'm not one of these comments who will fuck people.  I like people, but I think that they, just in general, are hypocrites.  Right.  Like, I don't, I don't believe, like, like, she gets mad because I'll say, like, I don't believe monogamy is a natural state.  I believe that you just get, like, now, you just have so much to lose, you kind of go, fuck it, I don't, just fuck you. 
[02:47:30]  If monogamy, if monogamy, monogamy was so natural, it wouldn't, you wouldn't get those urges.  Right.  And they wouldn't be so fucking strong.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Like, and she, like, she instills it in my children, and they are more like me.  They're more like, like, my daughter, my oldest daughter, she, she goes to church, but it's not, only because they'll do whatever. 
[02:48:00]  Is she the one that swallows the oysters?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  See, that's horrible.  See, that's horrible.  Jesus Christ.  You can't tell someone.  I'm just trying to, you know.  Right, Derek Geno, you can't tell.  We've talked about a lot of things.  I'm just trying to relate a little bit.  Yeah, she's that.  She swallows the oysters.  Yeah, she swallows the oysters, and not the bullshit.  But, like, I just, like, like, there's so much hypocrisy.  Like, there's no, like, like, you'll have some preacher railing on about gay people, and then he's fucking the boys.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's just, like, you'll hear people doing all these things, and then the music ministers is, you're like, this is bullshit. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, so it's complete bullshit.  So I won't do it.  Do you believe in God?  Of course.  I believe in God.  You just don't believe in the organized religion part?  I believe that organized religion, particularly in my community, like, like, look at all the shit that is, like, look at how skeptical you would have to be.  You come here, they take you out of this country, they beat you, they enslave you, they sell your kids off, and they go, hey, look, but you can believe in the same God that gave me all this loves you. 
[02:49:00]  So that's the whole, that's the whole introduction of it.  So from the beginning, and then I've never seen a black atheist, and the thing about it is there's very little evidence that God has ever lived around black people.  Like, God's never been to Haiti or Detroit or Nigeria.  But he was darker than we like to portray him.  No, but I'm just saying, like, at a certain point, you can see a black person going, maybe God doesn't like that.  Right, right, right. 
[02:49:30]  But he didn't have blonde hair and blue eyes either.  Well, that's Jesus.  Right, true.  Talking, you know, the big, big God.  Well, God is Jesus.  Jesus is God.  Well.  Same person.  No, God is the, Jesus is the son of God.  I know.  Is he?  I don't know.  But.  That's what I just told when I was a kid.  I was told some ghost stories.  And it's all these things I was told.  And I believe a lot.  Like, I think that anybody that would believe that they're physically superior, I mean, spiritually superior to somebody based on what they believe is already. 
[02:50:00]  Like, we live in a Christian country, and we espouse Christianity.  But in Japan, when they had those horrible nuclear, not one riot, nobody asked the government for anything.  Nobody priced God.  God, they're Buddhist.  Yeah, yeah.  Right, can you, if that shit happened here.  Oh, gosh.  Oh, yeah.  We're America, and people, when Katrina happened, people had to send us money.  And we're American.  Yeah.  Like, Puerto Rico ponied up some money. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  It's a couple of pesos.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the ugly sign of America.  Good point.  People, like, we are the richest country in the world, and people got together.  And they helped us out.  Right.  You didn't see one.  You didn't see us back on our feet.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Let me help you guys.  Well, you didn't see one telethon for it.  Nobody, not one celebrity sang a song for Japan.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Not one.  Yeah.  But we're.  Because it's too far away.  Too far away.  People do love faraway disasters. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, but Indonesia was far away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, they kind of helped them out.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what that's all about.  Chili's far away.  Well, if they weren't so.  Does Japan take foreign help, though?  They're like one of those countries that doesn't like a lot of foreign aid.  They're kind of a proud country.  Dishonorable.  Yeah.  If they didn't come across so emotionless, then maybe we would have helped them.  No, I just think that they don't.  You're right.  Well, fuck you.  Yeah, we're all right.  It's a radiated country.  I'll show some emotion, and then maybe we'll feel bad for you.  I think they just don't.  Like, they have nobody's greater than the other, they believe. 
[02:51:30]  Like, when a disaster happened, nobody said.  Like, those men went back into the nuclear brand, knowing they were going to die.  Yeah, just for the greater good.  Like, not so much.  No, not at all.  You can't even wrap your mind around that mentality.  So how is the guy that would make them that way, and the guy that makes us petty and small,  like, at least split the difference.  Yeah.  But let's be honest, they also sell panties and vending machines.  Let's not act like they're all the fucking messiah personified.  Yeah, let's not totally praise them. 
[02:52:00]  They do like the schoolgirl anime.  They can't come unless somebody's crying with shit on their face.  They love serpent cock in their anime.  Tub girl.  Tub girl, sure.  And Japanese porn is horrible.  And German, too.  I theorize that when you lose a world war, you take it out on each other sexually.  Man.  Because, like, the thing I don't, like, I was in Japan two weeks ago.  And it's like, everybody's, it's a nation full of tiger words.  Because everybody, it's the black dudes in Japan. 
[02:52:30]  And I get it.  It's kind of exotic.  And I get it.  But, like, and they, I can't, they're just so, like, I watch Japanese porn.  And everything you do hurts them.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  All right.  This is not.  Kind of a turn on, though.  Kind of a turn on.  It hurts a little.  Yeah.  A little bit, right?  Yeah, I get it.  It's not like, like, and it's this little Japanese.  They're like, look, I would crack a fucking rib. 
[02:53:00]  Are you crazy?  Are you crazy?  Yeah, they like them all little and.  All right.  Why are there octopus on these girls' heads?  Yeah.  Like, there's octopus on there.  Because why not, Anthony?  Why not?  Because why not?  Yeah, I don't, that's not.  I don't see that.  I don't, nothing really is going on there.  Yeah, no, no.  I'm not feeling it.  They just like the weirdest shit.  I can't enjoy an eel crawling out of a vagina.  It does nothing for me.  Fucking weird.  But Jerry porn I like.  Jerry?  Oh, I don't, who doesn't enjoy a good caviar party? 
[02:53:30]  But I just mean the barbaric shit they do in those porn.  Why were you in Japan?  Anything good?  I was touring for the troops.  But I actually just, I was doing a bunch of marine bases, which I, and I actually dig  working for the troops.  And I dig like that they let me be who I am.  You like going there?  I didn't, I didn't like Japan.  You didn't like it?  No.  Why?  Because I don't, I just.  Too different?  It's too different, the food, and then it's 17 hours, like California. 
[02:54:00]  17 hours, and then I was just, it's just a lot.  But what about the people?  The people are the nicest people.  You know, people get, like, I live here a lot now, and this is the most, these are the  nicest people I've ever been around.  Japanese?  No, New Yorkers.  Oh, New Yorkers?  Yeah.  Except, like, they'll do shit like this, I was eating in Soho, and I had dinner, and  I was trying to get a taxi, so after the taxi, I left my bag, I finally get a taxi, I left  my bag and wallet in the restaurant.  So I tell the manager to bring my bag out to me, and she's going to do it, but the taxi 
[02:54:30]  driver, I'm not going to wait.  And I'm like, well, start the meeting.  Once the meeting starts, it's the same.  Who cares?  I just want you to park it.  Right.  And he goes, I will not wait.  And I'm like, well, I'm not getting out the car.  And he actually says, see, that is why no one wants to pick your people up.  Oh, shit.  True story.  No, it's because you might get shot.  Get it straight.  And then I said, honestly, I said, that's why everybody think y'all terrorists.  So we're going back to Haji from Johnny Quest.  Why am I taking this shit from you?  Right.  He closes the little window they have and goes, fucking nigger. 
[02:55:00]  True story.  Holy shit.  And, like, you call a black man a nigga.  Eventually, a nigga will show up.  Right.  When you rub that lamp in a genie pop out, shazam, the nigga you asked for is him.  And I don't think he's paying.  Oh, shit.  So I, true story, I grabbed him through the window.  And I grabbed him.  I'm like, motherfucker.  And I didn't know those turbans were tied up.  I thought they were hats.  But they're not. 
[02:55:30]  It unwrapped.  Like, I'm like, who the fuck is it?  And he calls the police.  And I get out of the taxi.  And I go back to my apartment.  And left my bag in the car.  Oh, no.  So I have to call Precinct 1.  And I actually had his Precinct 1.  They run down the taxi.  Call the, got the taxi.  He comes.  And so he says, and I have pictures on Twitter of this.  So the police officer says, well, look, he says that you tore his shirt and that, you know, you give him $30 and it'll be okay and he'll give you a thing back. 
[02:56:00]  And I go, I gave him a 50 and I said, this was exact, the exact same 50 I was going to give you for taking me home.  And the turban was funny because it was red at first and now it was yellow.  Like, caution.  Caution.  It was.  It was.  And I'm just like, I don't have experiences like that.  Like, oh.  Yeah.  It's like, even, even like when I was like Mark Twain, like we're very uncomfortable with race.  Like Mark Twain, they decided to take the word nigga out of all Mark Twain's books. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  Yeah.  He said it 219 times, Huckleberry Finn.  Wow.  And four times a time, Sawyer.  And they decided they would replace the word nigga with slave.  Right.  Yeah.  Like, cause, like, but they didn't ask that because I don't, that's not an upgrade.  No, that doesn't seem to be an upgrade, right?  I'd rather be a nigga than a slave.  You call me nigga, I could be offended, but I could still drive home to my house.  You call me slave, I gotta go with you.  We were all about that story, and that's the best take yet.  That's very funny. 
[02:57:00]  We were so pissed off that they're changing books.  Yeah.  They change books because we're uncomfortable.  Like, Texas doesn't mean to slave trade.  Who's uncomfortable, though?  I was on Twitter.  No one was uncomfortable.  But even if they didn't understand why they were doing this.  You're supposed to be.  Because that was your word.  Sometimes being uncomfortable is a good thing.  Right.  It reminds you that you can get uncomfortable.  Jesus.  And it also reminds you how far you've come.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  I actually wrote, I didn't feel the word was used enough.  I was upset.  I'm going to sell out that much. 
[02:57:30]  It's amazing how we do try to structure things so we're all completely milquetoast and comfortable.  And nobody has that, people don't know how to deal with social awkwardness.  And you know what?  Race is socially awkward.  Right.  Tough shit.  You have to deal with it.  But it's only socially awkward.  Like, Texas changed all of their books.  They took the slave trade out.  And they call it Triangle.  The Triangler Trade.  They don't mention slavery.  And first, it took me long enough to get used to getting called a nigga.  Now I'm a triangle, too.  I don't like that. 
[02:58:00]  I'm a triangle.  But I think that it seems disingenuous.  Because political correctness means I won't say how I really feel.  Right.  I'll just be urbane.  Right.  You still feel the same way.  You're just being told you can't say it.  You're not really changing anybody's thoughts.  I like when they switch to N-word.  Because where they used to just have to say a racial epithet.  Right.  Which could be a couple of things.  Right.  Then on the news, when they're like, and he used the N-word.  And you're like, all right.  Now at least I know exactly what he said. 
[02:58:30]  And boy, they say N-word a lot.  Yeah.  And you know what's funny?  Is that I'm only mad that we don't have a word that's equally as incendiary.  Yeah.  Like, that's what our scientist needs to give us.  Well, keep trying.  You guys will come up with something eventually.  Eventually, because you know what it is.  Keep trying.  The only reason Russia and America never went to war, because it was mutually assured destruction.  Right.  Like, I got a lot of shit.  You got a lot of shit.  Right.  We don't want to.  Right.  We need some shit like that for you.  Some kind of, yeah.  What's the best word language so far?  No, it's not.  There isn't even a clue. 
[02:59:00]  That's just silly.  I'll tell you.  It's a combination of words.  George Jefferson.  That's funny.  I fucked your daughter.  That's a wrong word.  That trumps them all.  It's a little wrong, but it works.  Father alone.  There you go.  Oh, that's not father-in-law.  Neighbor.  Baby daddy's words.  That's funny.  And you know, thank you for that, because I have to have that.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah, that's.  Yeah, right.  Like, when I watched, like, the whole reason Gingrich did good in South Carolina, because 
[02:59:30]  he looked like he was taking black people to task.  Yeah, yeah.  He really did.  Oh, yeah.  He got up there and spelt out a few things about the welfare, you know, Obama being the  welfare president and.  Yeah, food stamp president.  Food stamp president.  And how blacks and Hispanics should operate to get jobs and things.  Like you said, the janitor thing.  Gingrich is just a douche.  And he looks like a douche.  Yeah, but he's making it fun, though.  He really is.  I'm watching debates. 
[03:00:00]  I don't watch debates.  I've been watching all of them because of him.  Imagine him and Obama debating.  You know what it'd be?  The problem is he'll look raging and angry.  Right.  And.  Although someone told him to start, like, loosening up a little bit and smiling.  Yeah, that's just like being a less.  It's fake, but he's changing in the last week or two, because I really am all about this  lately.  And he's starting to smile and not be so fucking.  But even when he smiles.  Here's the thing.  Ornery.  When you like when I was watching the State of the Union address. 
[03:00:30]  Right.  Obama's when he smiles, he looked like he's.  Were you worried about his color, though?  Yeah, I thought.  What was what was that about there?  Between him and Bonner, I thought it was two black dudes.  And it has to be rough.  Like every time I see him given the State of the Union, it makes me proud.  I just like because usually when I see a black dude with two white dudes sitting behind  and he's in court.  So this is a little different.  This is so.  So I wasn't sure if my TV was fucked up.  No, everybody on Twitter was.  Or his livers fell. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Or is they got the wrong.  He's got to fire his makeup.  Yeah.  That was the wrong color.  Right.  But.  Who do you think is the biggest threat to Obama?  As far as.  I think the biggest threat to Obama.  Romney.  Is is not even Romney.  Romney looks so.  Between who's left, though.  I don't.  I think that Obama's biggest threat is really if the economy keeps kind of sputtering along.  What person is.  Yeah.  None of these guys.  Their negatives are going like Gingrich is almost 60 percent negative. 
[03:01:30]  Like already.  He's not a dude that people don't know.  They know him and they hate him.  And Romney's negatives are almost close to 50.  You have to love the way Newt handled his marriage.  That's the thing they tried to get dirt on is the only thing I like about him.  He was married to an ugly chick.  And he's like, I want to start fucking other people.  I actually made me kind of relate to him.  You want to hang around and continue cooking for me?  Feel free.  But I'm going to be fucking other prettier women.  I'm tired of fucking one of the way outs from the Flintstones.  I'd like to move on to a younger lady. 
[03:02:00]  I have cancer.  Everybody has cancer.  Like when a dude leaves, like when you leave your woman that had the mother of your children  where she's struggling with cancer, like you leave right there.  Like what would you do to 300 million people you don't know?  Right, right.  That's someone he apparently loved at some point in his life.  You married her.  You had kids.  I don't really.  I mean, I don't have the moral.  I think that you should have as many women as you can afford.  I really do.  I think that that's.  And then you can get away with hiding. 
[03:02:30]  Right.  But he just seems like a horrible.  Like he he brags a lot about how he, you know, everything he did.  He didn't.  He didn't fucking.  Reagan didn't know you.  He's like Al Gore who invented the Internet.  But yeah, like he's a fucking horrible dude.  And Mitt Romney is.  First off, I think they don't like him because he's Mormon.  Yeah, that's going to be a tough one, especially with middle America Christians.  They're going to be like, hey, fuck this guy.  So we can they can hate black people, but obviously they can be Christians. 
[03:03:00]  God loves it.  Yeah.  You know, you can still be a Christian.  I think they don't know what a Mormon is and they don't dig it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't know anything about the history of magic underwear.  What is that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Magic underwear.  And the it's not an old enough religion.  No.  You see the Book of Mormon.  No, no.  But I keep.  Oh, DL.  Fuck.  You can't call your masterpiece.  I asked for all in a couple of times for tickets.  Call your people.  Give me nothing.  Don't get you.  What?  Yeah.  Just pay for them.  Yeah.  Pay for them.  But you can get it.  You guys can get it.  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  It's always sold out like weeks in a row.  I've never really even been to.  I don't know.  I hate musicals.  I despise them.  It's great.  Yeah.  You'll love it.  I've got to see it, dude.  They have cute fucking jokes.  Really?  It's really good.  And it works.  It's really dark.  And it's really.  You ever watch The Wire?  Yeah.  Brother Muzon is in it.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  See, Michael Potts.  Yeah, he sings.  Brother Muzon was great.  I didn't know it was him until after.  Because he doesn't have glasses on.  He plays.  He's one of the leads.  Yeah.  And I'm like.  He looked.  It drove me nuts.  Is this Mormons? 
[03:04:00]  Mormon missionaries.  They just make fun of the religion.  That go to Africa.  It tells you how Mormonism started.  Or whatever it's called started.  And then these two guys go to Africa.  To recruit.  To try to recruit these very, very, very poor villagers to become Mormons.  And it's a musical.  And on the surface, selling it like that, there's nothing I wanted to see less.  But we had a couple of them coming in.  I'm like.  Let me go see it.  Because it was Matt and Trey from South Park.  I'm like.  Those guys are kind of dark.  And even.  They're very dark.  Kind of. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of.  Like you were kind of dark.  Yeah.  They're slightly creepy.  But it was brilliant, man.  It's fucking.  I got to see it.  Brilliant and funny.  It really is.  And it's not.  There's nothing cheesy about it.  No.  And it makes sense.  But it's not like the typical attack on religion.  Where you're like.  All right.  We got it.  Predictable.  They humanize Mormons.  But they also make fun of it.  It's really fucking brilliant.  Really?  Yeah.  It's great.  It's one of the best things I've ever seen.  What is the basis?  Like.  All I know is like.  Up until the late 70s.  They believed it was a sin to be black. 
[03:05:00]  Oh really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.  Wow.  1978 is when they turned their corner on black people.  And I don't know what.  But it's the government.  Basically.  You can't keep.  Have an exemption as a religion.  If you're.  If you're excluding people.  Right.  Right.  Right.  And my problem with that is.  You still.  If you really believe what you're saying.  Then the government can't make you change it.  You still always believe that.  Right.  So my problem is.  That I know that they're doing what they have to do. 
[03:05:30]  To kind of keep a religious status.  But they still.  If you believe.  From inception.  That it was a sin to be black.  And that the only person.  Where a black person can get to heaven.  Is if.  If a white person bouts for them.  And they still would have to be slaves.  In heaven.  That's they believe that.  They really say that.  They really believe that.  Now.  That's hilarious.  Why would you change just because the government says you can't have a text.  No black people are voting for Romney.  Right.  You can't.  Oh wow.  Just because you can't have.  Basically you can't.  You can't call yourself a religion.  And enjoy the status of a religion. 
[03:06:00]  If people are excluded.  And so we're going to.  You know.  You change for that reason.  You still believe.  Well DL.  How else would heaven be for white people?  Yeah.  That is true.  You just described heaven.  What's wrong with that?  Look at.  I just fucking recruited half the sun.  Wait.  You know what.  That's why.  Why don't we sign up?  That's why Sharpton.  That's why Sharpton.  That's why Sharpton.  That's why Sharpton.  Remember Sharpton blasted it.  And everyone was annoyed.  But actually looking back.  I kind of agree with Sharpton.  And one thing I'll ever agree on.  Sharpton on. 
[03:06:30]  Was when he blasted someone for being a Mormon.  And suddenly he smashed their religion.  It's like.  Yeah.  I kind of get it.  I'm a Mormon.  Yeah.  Who.  Oh is anybody.  And I get it.  Like.  I live in L.A.  Calabasas.  The.  The.  The.  Moorpark.  Thousand.  Thousand.  A lot of Mormons.  I just don't understand how it is.  That you can actually believe.  Up until 1978.  We ain't talking about.  78's disco.  Right.  Right.  Like.  Like.  Like.  Most.  Like.  Like.  Definitely Romney's children were raised.  Right.  Part of their life. 
[03:07:00]  Believing that black people.  Couldn't get that.  How are you supposed to stop sinning?  Yeah.  It's like.  Now what's the point?  Yeah.  What's.  Like.  What is the incentive for me?  To like.  Yeah.  I get to have it.  Get to get to.  I live an exemplary life.  And then my reward is to drive the Osmonds around.  What the fuck?  Well I'm bad at it.  If I hear this song one more goddamn time.  Like.  What is it?  And so.  I like.  And it's just like.  You.  You.  You kind of know these things.  And I think that most people just. 
[03:07:30]  Think that that's like.  Kind of a.  They don't know what that is.  And so I think the South.  You know.  Jesus said it.  I believe it.  And that's it.  You want to talk to a Mormon?  Yeah.  I never talked to a Mormon before.  I think.  Hey.  Mitch.  Are they.  Are you a Mormon?  No.  Not a Mormon.  Oh.  Piece of shit.  The other night.  And one of the funniest jokes was.  They said in 1978.  God changed his mind.  And said it was okay to be black.  God changed his mind.  God changed his mind.  What did you say?  He's always saying that's what the play said. 
[03:08:00]  In the Book of Mormon.  Yeah.  So they.  The guy sings it.  They acknowledge this.  He sings it.  He goes.  Yeah.  In 1978.  God changed his mind.  About black people.  Yeah.  It's a really great.  But it's.  It's the government that did it.  Yeah.  You got to go DL to this.  Yeah.  I do now.  I'm telling you.  It's very very funny.  I'm not.  I don't like musicals at all.  And usually when you go to this.  You start looking how many songs left.  Not once did I do that.  No.  Really.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  And it's a long play musical too, right?  Two hours.  Two hours.  Yeah.  With an intermission.  But it flies by, man.  I couldn't believe.  It's funny.  Hilarious.  As a comic.  You've got to go.  I laughed out loud. 
[03:08:30]  Alone on a Wednesday afternoon watching it.  Oh, well.  I went to a matinee.  Yeah.  And believe me.  I had no.  Because I fucking loathe musicals.  Right.  I've never.  No.  The kid's the Lion King.  Hey, I hate all of them.  Yeah.  But this is an adult musical.  And it's funny.  And it's really smart.  Everybody's talking about how great it is.  Yeah.  And it's like.  I didn't.  You know.  You never want to buy it and go.  Yeah.  It is as good as everyone said.  But it really was.  It was.  And it's funny.  And it's serbic.  Really.  I bought.  I bought a musical soundtrack.  Yeah.  Jimmy. 
[03:09:00]  Don't admit that.  Don't admit that.  I enjoy it.  Don't admit that.  I have to go.  Because I have to.  I have to catch a plane.  And my camera.  Oh, you're doing.  I'm doing Tempe.  Yeah.  I'm doing Leno Monday.  Stand up live, right?  What?  Stand up live.  Tempe improv.  That's the.  I'll tell you about the new joint.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I'm doing the Tempe improv.  Yeah.

[03:09:30]  They always come out to see me.  And they're the lightest people on the face of them.  Really nice.  Like Scottsdale.  They're very nice.  Nice people down there.  Yeah.  I mean.  You know.  Between the fact of sending.  Mexicans out.  Well, I guess I moved up since all the.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Mexicans are the enemy.  Right.  In Arizona.  They don't like those Mexicans.  We'll all finish.  Okay.  I'm going to run.  Kenny has my camera, by the way.  The cab he returned it.  And I had a camera I left in a cab yesterday.

Always good to see you guys.  Fuck you.  Always good to see you.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  Last time we had a problem, so I want to apologize personally.  Yeah, you got sick.  I don't know.  Somebody got sick.  Yeah, something went on.  You were here, but we weren't here or something.  And then right after that, Patrice was just a. . . 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, that was a bummer, man.  Fuck.  Good dude, man.  Yeah.  Really good dude.  And not one of those dudes you can. . .  He's the kind of dude you're really sorry that. . .  You can think of 15 other people that that should have happened to before him.  Because he's so irreplaceable.  He's so irreplaceable.  There's nobody else that you could even go, well, this guy's kind of like Patrice.  Right.  You know, there's not even. . .  No one was even close.  Like any. . .  A good guy, which adds to the credence, you should be a fucked up human being.  Because fucked up people live. . .  Yeah, yeah.  Like a good grandmother always lives alone.  Do you know what somebody asked me yesterday? 
[03:12:00]  The bad grandmother.  Adrian asked me in an interview.  We were talking and we spoke at his wake.  And she was asking me, what were you thinking he would say to you?  And I really mean this.  While I was talking, all I could think of was him going, shut up.  Yeah, right, right.  Shut up, Jim.  Shut up.  Right, right, right.  Just telling me to shut up.  Right.  You'd shush people real loud.  There was nothing better.  I would beg him to shush people.  Oh, yeah.  There was nothing funny because he had that big fucking mouth.  And he could shush 500 people in a theater. 
[03:12:30]  And it's an instinct that when somebody goes, shh, that you just stop talking.  And he would do it at the cellar for hours.  And they would stop and they would go, what the fuck?  And then he would do it again.  Fucking hilarious, man.  He was a great dude, man.  He was a little child just begging him to shush.  He was a great dude.  All right, D.O., good luck, man.  Kick the ass.  You're doing Jay Leno, too, man.  On Monday, yeah.  Good job.  Oh, I'm back next Friday.  I'm hosting with Kelly.  Ah, you're doing the. . .  Yeah, it'll be cool.
