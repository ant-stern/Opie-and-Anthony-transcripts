<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with typical off-topic banter, including bizarre hypotheticals involving Bill Gates and mace, before transitioning to a discussion of their weekend, briefly mentioning Sarah Palin. The main focus quickly shifted to a scathing critique of the Emmy Awards opening ceremony.  The hosts relentlessly mocked the unprepared and poorly received performances of Ryan Seacrest, Heidi Klum, Jeff Probst, Howie Mandel, and Tom Bergeron,  further lambasting a reunion segment featuring the aging cast of "Laugh-In," highlighting the dated nature of their humor and speculating, via a caller, on the health of Alan Seuss.  This Emmy critique continued intermittently throughout the broadcast.  The discussion also included a segment on childhood disciplinary actions from their fathers, sparked by a caller's question about Anthony's claim of being disciplined with a "strap."

A substantial portion of the show featured audio clips and discussion from Anthony's appearance on the Ron and Fez radio show, detailing a messy breakup with his girlfriend, Jill.  The story included a girlfriend hiding in a closet when Jill unexpectedly arrived, Jill's subsequent discovery, the theft of Anthony's Escalade, her return to retrieve belongings and burning the other woman's clothes in his fire pit, and the loss of Anthony's gun license.  This was punctuated with frequent profanity and humorous descriptions of the chaotic events. This breakup story was revisited throughout the broadcast.  The hosts’ discussion of this breakup was interspersed with numerous listener calls offering advice and opinions.  Anthony’s tendency to date younger women was also discussed.  His comedic anecdotes about past relationships, including a "romance night" with numerous candles and use of a "J.O. Rolodex," were also featured.  The hosts also recounted bizarre stories, including a listener's anecdote about a fake Brazilian tribe news story and a tale of Anthony's brother's ex-wife falsely accusing him of assault.

The show featured extensive commentary on interviews conducted by show employee Sam at an NBC premiere party.  Sam's awkward interviews with relatively unknown cast members from "The Office" (Phyllis and Leslie),  "The Biggest Loser" (Bob Harper, who was unfamiliar with Opie and Anthony),  and others were played, showcasing their lack of insightful commentary and leading to further mockery from the hosts.  Sam's interviews with Jenna Fisher and Angela Kinsey were also mentioned, with the hosts again highlighting the perceived inanity of the interviews. Sam's experiences in Los Angeles included a solo limousine ride and an alternative income source.  His interviews with Christian Slater and Michael Malley (host of "Guts") were also discussed, with Malley's interview focusing on his memories of "Guts," particularly the "Aggro Crag."  Further commentary focused on the perceived weight of Hayden Panettiere and Jennifer Love Hewitt's aging.  The hosts also mocked the show's website logo, highlighting a sponsor's larger logo over their own.

The broadcast also included a segment on a trip to Los Angeles, details about a shooting range visit with humorous anecdotes about their shooting abilities, and the introduction of a new segment, "The Dumbest Man in the Country," featuring Eric Nagel ("Hoagie Boy," "Eswab," "Efat") from Florida.  A recurring comedic element involved the fictional "Hoagie Boy" character.  A listener-submitted video showing a woman mistaking a towed truck for a car driving backward was also reviewed.  The show also included discussion of Opie's upcoming appearance on Fox's "Red Eye," Jim Norton's appearance on HBO, a Hoagie Boy trailer, and a statistic about a segment of white Democrats holding negative views of Black people, leading to a discussion of the biases in statistical surveys. The show ended with discussions of the Sirius XM merger, contract negotiations, a detailed reminiscence about a Jackie Gleason television movie, praise for Michael K. Williams’s recent appearance, promotion of a YouTube video featuring a terrified intern, and an early end to the broadcast due to prior commitments.  Bob Eatman, referred to as a "super agent," was mentioned as being present.  The hosts' discussion regarding Robert Plant's solo career and his collaboration with Alison Krauss, and their strong negative opinions about their music,  were also part of the broadcast.  Throughout the show, frequent profanity was used.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, we get it.  If I was Bill Gates, all I would do is buy things that people would love  and then just set them on fire and then put them out with a tinkle.  Your friends and family definitely needs to call 1-800-IN-PERVENTION.  Screw them.  His friends and family, who do you think he's drinking with?  Exactly.  When using mace on one of the burglars,  would you say that one of the burglars was more likely  to not move their face away when the mace was shot at them?  Some people are better at certain aspects of burglarizing than others. 
[00:00:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  How are you?  Oh, great.  How was your weekend?  Another one of these Monday things, huh?  Yeah, weekend was good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hung out. 
[00:01:00]  Uh-huh.  Didn't do much, though.  Just hung around the house.  Went to the range for a little bit.  Blast off a few.  You know, like Sarah Palin there.  I like, you know, going to the range.  Well, she's in town.  You should look her up.  I know.  Maybe shoot a few rounds with Sarah Palin.  How does she get to fire off guns in the city?  What are you talking about?  She's in Alaska.  Right. 
[00:01:30]  She's a resident of Alaska.  You can't just have guns in the city and start blasting them off.  What's that all about?  She's firing someone else's guns.  Oh.  Ooh.  Let me go down a range and try to blast off a few rounds.  Yeah.  Bastards.  Hello, Jimmy.  Hey, guys.  Last night was a very strange night of TV.  Yeah.  I was showing Anthony some of the strange highlights of what was going on. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, the stupid Emmy Awards?  Well, we have to take a peek, I guess, just so we're informed for the radio show.  But what a bore fest that was.  Once again.  Once again.  How'd Ricky do?  Ricky Gervais was hilarious.  I don't know.  Did he end up winning anything?  He didn't win?  Okay.  We don't have to go down the list of winners, do we?  That's like who gives a crap radio.  You know, 30 Rock won something.  Here we go. 
[00:02:30]  30 Rock won something.  I'm going to guess Desperate Housewives won something.  Some made-for-TV movie won for something.  John Adams.  It was John Adams.  Okay.  Paul Giamatti won.  Yeah.  And, like, Entourage people won.  There you go.  There's your Emmy wrap-up.  We don't have to do that.  I'll tell you this much, and we should get audio.  The opening of the Emmys was horrendous.  Horrendous.  Yeah, I saw clips of it. 
[00:03:00]  I don't know what they were going for.  I have no idea.  They had four reality show hosts come out.  Ryan Seacrest.  Who did you have?  Heidi Klum.  You had Jeff Probst.  Howie Mandel.  Right.  And Seacrest.  There were five of them.  Oh, five.  And then Bergeron.  Yeah.  And then it looked like they wanted these guys to just kind of wing it, like they're doing a reality show.  Yeah.  And they just bombed horribly.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know.  Was it that they, well, because that's good, you know, get them out there.  Hey, you're a reality show host.  Get out there and just do it off the cuff.  Wing it.  Yeah, yeah.  Ooh.  Didn't work out too well.  It didn't go anywhere.  My girl's like, are you getting uncomfortable like I am?  She had to hide her eyes because she gets uncomfortable in situations like that.  Oh, it was really bad.  So, and then later on, they had the cast of Laughin.  Laughin hasn't been on the air in 35 years. 
[00:04:00]  Probably 40.  Yeah.  And, and, ah, whatever.  Yeah, you're right.  It is like 40 years, 68.  You know, we're doing exactly what I said we probably shouldn't do.  I go to add, we probably shouldn't do a Laughin break because most of the listeners will go, I'm out of here.  I have no idea what that is.  But this Laughin was a show, it was all about timing and one-liners and you had to open up those doors and close them fast.  And you had these, these old, old, old people trying to like, do what they were doing in their youth. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, see, there'd be a big wall with like little door windows, but they were like doors.  Little doors that they'd peek their heads out and go, hey, uh, Joanne Worley, you know, did you hear the one about, and then they'd tell a stupid joke and he'd shut his door and Joanne Worley would open it up and say something that was only funny when like Hanoi was being bombed.  Yeah.  It's just the, it was some of the worst crap. 
[00:05:00]  And they couldn't close the doors anymore.  No, because they're all old and they can't even, well, how does this work?  Right.  Biggest surprise is Alan Seuss is still alive.  Who is Alan Seuss?  Oh.  Obviously one of the guys from Laughin, but.  Alan Seuss was just about a, uh, he was like a fit in the same category as Charles Nelson Reilly and, um, what's his name from, from, uh, Hollywood Squares?  He always had a scarf on.  The center square. 
[00:05:30]  Paul Linde.  Paul Linde.  Paul Linde.  He was like a poor man's Paul Linde.  Yeah.  A wannabe Paul Linde.  Paul Linde, maybe without the amyl nitrate poppers.  Maybe.  But he, uh, yeah, Alan Seuss was that, oh, and he used to do weird things with his eyes and.  I don't remember him.  Looked like a kid toucher.  I barely remember laughing.  I remember calling around on the floor as my parents were watching it.  I do believe, right?  Yeah.  I used to have to like, uh, peek out of my bedroom and watch it cause it was a little too risque. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  And I wasn't allowed to watch it.  So I'd peek out, me and my brother and if my father caught us, he'd come in with a strap, you know, give us a little beating for just wanting to watch a TV show.  Thanks.  You get a beating for just trying to be a kid.  Yeah.  I just, you know.  Very curious about everything in life and, and, and, you know, you get beat down for it.  Yeah.  It's, you know, relatively, it's still early considering it's not like the show was on at 11 o'clock at night or anything.  And, you know, maybe we want to take a little peek and see what was going on. 
[00:06:30]  And if we were caught, uh, we were beaten with a leather strap.  Yeah.  It's wonderful, isn't it?  Ow.  And you shouldn't watch that show.  I never understood that cause I, I shared a room with my brothers too.  And nighttime was where you're like, you know, when I grow up, I'm going to be an astronaut.  What are you going to be?  Well, I think I'm going to be a major league baseball player.  And it's your time to kind of communicate with each other.  Communicate, dream a little.  Yeah.  And, you know.  Knock it off. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Pops would be at the door yelling and screaming, go to sleep in there.  Shut up.  This is our time.  We're like, we're curious about everything around us.  And we're like, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're dreaming here, Pops.  I hear you get to sleep.  Right.  Come up with the strap.  And then you're just scared of the strap.  So you don't go to sleep anyway.  And you're all tired for school.  Yeah.  But why did you really need a good night's sleep at 12?  Yeah.  So you could be that much better at kickball.  Like, did it really matter if we got our sleep at 12 years old?  Oh.  They probably just wanted to fool around.  So they were just waiting for us to, you know, crash. 
[00:07:30]  There was some kind of wacky schedule we had, too.  Like, like, I had to go to sleep at, I think, 730.  But my brother could stay up till nine because he was a little older.  Yeah.  What the hell's that crap?  Yeah.  You know, I'm being penalized because I'm younger.  What do I need more sleep?  I'm a kid.  I could frigging go like, you know.  Five days with no sleep.  Just give me some candy bars.  I'm good to go.  That's so true.  I'd sit there, you know, as I'm peeking out watching shows I'm not supposed to watch, 
[00:08:00]  I'd see my father on the couch.  He needed to sleep.  Not you.  No, I'm fine.  You wanted to run to the house at 2 in the morning.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, morning.  Yeah, am I mistaken?  Did I hear Anthony say that his father would come out with a strap on if he caught the one?  Oh, damn.  I might have misspoken, but I did mean just a strap, you douche.  No, never a strap on.  Why not?  That would keep you.  You would be quiet. 
[00:08:30]  No, you'd hear me in the pillow.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  We'll get into that in a minute, sir.  Trust me.  We'll get into that in a minute.  Well, he still wants to play Bernie Williams.  Hey, Robin in Detroit, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hi.  Good.  I'm on my way to the airport coming to see you guys tomorrow.  But anyway, the laughing thing, that Alan Seuss guy, did you notice that he must have had the AIDS?  Because he had a big AIDS thing, and he looked like he was going to die in about two days. 
[00:09:00]  He was the only guy there wearing the red ribbon, was it?  Is that what I noticed?  It was a big, shiny ribbon, and he looked like death warmed up.  I don't think that was AIDS.  I think that was just real old age.  I know the AIDS makes you look like you're older than you are, but that guy is old.  Something tells me every friend he's ever had has died of it, so, you know, he was wearing the ribbon.  Yeah, he's...  All right.  Thank you, Robin.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Here's...  It's worth a play, man. 
[00:09:30]  The Emmys.  They start with these guys, and we love Howie Mandel.  We've had most of those guys on the radio show over the years, but actually, Howie kind  of almost saved the opening, because he had a couple of really good lines in there, but  the rest of it was horrendous.  You were waiting for the joke to start.  You were waiting for where this was going.  What was the big reveal?  Something, and it never happened.  They said there was no teleprompter.  They had no teleprompters. 
[00:10:00]  Nothing was on them.  It seems like they just went out to wing it.  Right.  And it was horrible, and I don't know if it was that.  I don't know if it was the fact that reality programming was still on during the writer's  strike, and it was kind of a joke like, hey, the writers didn't give us anything, but  they never really addressed that.  Were you supposed to just come to that conclusion because the teleprompters were empty?  It made no sense.  There was no setup to it.  It was just them on stage bombing. 
[00:10:30]  Just bombing.  This is a big night for television, obviously some of the biggest stars in the world.  For us.  For us.  This is an honor.  This is an honor.  We feel like the stepchild of television, and for you to accept us in reality, host reality  television as part of this, just makes, I'm, this is important.  It's exciting.  I'm really serious.  Thank you for letting us into the club.  I wanted this to be special.  I want this to be, this is my moment.  Our moment. 
[00:11:00]  Our moment.  Thanks, Howard.  Yes, I'm sorry.  You're, you're supposed to be uncomfortable out there in radio land, by the way.  Yeah.  Be uncomfortable like we are.  Seriously, we wanted to bring something to the party.  We wanted to make this night special.  We have met.  We wanted to do something special for this night.  When do you get a chance like this?  We've gone to Ryan's house many times, which I must say, television has been very good to  Seacrest.  It has a nice place.  Radio, actually.  We have met at Jerry's Deli's in Sherman Oaks. 
[00:11:30]  Yes, we did.  A couple of times.  We tried.  We did.  And we wanted to come up with something special.  And as of this moment, right now, no lie, at two minutes into the show, on Emmy night,  we have absolutely nothing for you.  And it's not a joke.  This is not a bit.  This is reality.  And who best to offer that to you?  As a matter of nothing.  There's a billion people listening and watching.  This is like the opening to the show.  And there's like a billion people worldwide. 
[00:12:00]  And they apparently thought it was this radio show.  Hey, when we eat it, you know, at least we're trying to do something.  They're eating it in front of a billion people worldwide.  Yeah.  Doing nothing.  Hopefully less.  Because of the Yankees and the Cowboy games, I'm hoping that the Emmys probably took a nice  hit.  It had to be a hit.  I bet they did.  They had to.  And then it continues.  We're almost done here.  We don't have a no zero.  We have nothing. 
[00:12:30]  We are like on Sarah Palin's bridge to nowhere.  Yeah.  That's where we are, right?  That's where we are.  I'm serious.  We are.  This is not a joke.  I'm serious.  The government can't even bail us out of this.  This is like five reality hosts.  We don't even have a contestant.  We have nothing.  And is that all you got?  Because that's about as good as it's going to get.  I told you I have nothing.  This is serious.  It's not a bit.  See how we had two gray lines there.  If it wasn't for that.  And by the way, this is just a highlight of the open. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, it went on and on and on and on.  And finally, they awkwardly left.  You know, we do take this seriously.  We should host the show.  We should welcome people to the show.  But Oprah already did that.  She did that.  So we thought we'd come out and tell you about the 60th anniversary of the Emmys.  But she did that.  She did that.  Oprah did that.  So setting the tone?  It's been done.  Well, what's left for us to do?  You tell me.  What should we do?  What is there for us to do?  Nothing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  And what have we prepared?  Absolutely.  Nothing.  Holy mackerel. 
[00:13:30]  I think.  So, to be clear, by doing nothing, we have fulfilled our obligation.  So we're good?  We're good.  Oh, all right.  Great.  This is your network.  You deal with it.  Do you think they walked off and went, nah, that went good, man.  I think.  I couldn't have.  For reality hosts, I think they're out of touch with reality.  So they probably thought, yeah, that went well.  I'm mad.  It went really well.  I'm mad.  Just like I was last night when I saw that.  Oof.  I'm just mad. 
[00:14:00]  That's horrific.  Howie probably pushed for nothing.  He's like, yeah, whatever.  Because he's a comic.  So he's like, yeah, whatever.  Let's just wing it.  Yeah.  He knew he'd come off looking okay.  Yeah.  Dummies are like, so will we.  Yeah.  Well, then Heidi Klum was there.  Her whole job was just to kind of like be annoyed and just, you know, stand there.  She said nothing.  She said nothing.  And Bergeron said nothing.  Seacrest really said nothing.  It was bizarre, man.  Absolutely bizarre.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  We're doing something a little different today.  I don't really.  What are we doing, Stunt Brain? 
[00:14:30]  I got to read this?  Oh, this is very exciting, Opie.  Today's show brought to you with limited commercials, thanks to NBC and NBC Premier Week?  That's correct.  Yes.  And then what do we do?  And now what?  Well, Sam went out there and interviewed a bunch of stars for the big Premier Week this  week, and he's got one little special for you every hour.  Are we playing that right now?  No.  Now you have to play the NBC promo stuff.  That's the limited commercial interruption stuff.  So we just keep talking?  No, you go to commercials. 
[00:15:00]  But it says limited commercials.  There are not as many as there used to be.  But now we are having commercials.  But it's limited because they come on.  What?  Who?  The NBC thing.  Yeah.  See, what we're doing is what they did last night.  See, we're just winging.  Oh, we're winging.  We're going to get to rip Heidi Klum's tux off.  So I wasn't supposed to read this right now?  Absolutely you are.  So today's show brought to you with limited commercials, thanks to NBC and NBC Premier Week,  but now we're going to play commercials.  Yeah, but they're limited.  How many minutes?  Instead of eight, there's going to be six. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, wow.  That's really limited.  That's 25% less.  Hey, that's 25% less.  Wow.  Look what you guys get today.  Woo-hoo.  Limited commercials.  877-212-ON-A.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  877-212-ON-A.  Hey, let's say hi to Jamie in West Palm Beach, Florida.  Jamie, how are you?  Hey, boys.  What's up?  What's up?  I just wanted to do a laugh in the Patriots fans' face because you got beat by a 1-15 team last year. 
[00:16:00]  So, ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  You got to give the Pats a break this year, man.  They're in a tough spot there, Jamie.  Yeah, that's it.  That's all I got.  Punching up.  All right.  Yeah, the Pats lost to the Dolphins.  What, 38-13?  Yeah.  My God, man.  And Dallas beat Green Bay 27-16?  America's team, Jimmy.  I saw part of the game. 
[00:16:30]  It was very enjoyable.  Yeah?  Yes.  Why only part of the game?  You're a big Cowboys fan.  I'm also a big fan of getting a stretch therapy, which is very good.  Oh.  Oh.  I see.  It's non-sexual, unfortunately.  Completely legit.  Bugs me.  Wouldn't you want it to be a little sexual?  A little stretching, a little sexual?  Wonderful.  It would be a perfect combination, right?  I know.  There's some areas that are just begging to be stretched.  If they weren't.  Stretched, unstretched, stretched, unstretched.  Exactly.  You can find it slapped, dabbed, and left alone. 
[00:17:00]  The door's over there.  It helps, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, it really helps.  I got a massage over the weekend, and the woman told me, she's like,  you have no tension whatsoever anywhere.  Wow.  None.  Well, probably one place, but...  No, I really...  No, that wasn't true.  That was a nice way of saying you have no muscle tone whatsoever.  You know that, right?  Oh, oh.  You know that, right?  Her thumbs were pressing through and actually touching the sheet below my chest. 
[00:17:30]  She's like, you have no body mass.  You're a jellyfish.  That's good news.  Oh, the stupid Mets.  I had a...  Wow, they are just blowing it.  I went to a wedding in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  My God.  Say it ain't so.  Oh, you did?  I was in Scranton, Pennsylvania for...  Scranton?  ...for two effing days, and wow, we have some fans up there.  Dumb, dumb Fareed and that Citadel.  We were on a station up there, and it was doing very well,  because a lot of people recognizing, you know, myself while I was up there 
[00:18:00]  and saying, what happened, man?  We were on a...  And I'm like, well, why don't you call Fareed?  Because he seems to know what he's doing in the radio world.  But besides that, I had to hang out with a lot of Philly people,  and man, they were just killing me.  Yeah.  Killing me.  Mets lost.  Now they're a game and a half behind the Phillies.  Game and a half back.  Didn't we have like a three-game lead a week ago?  They just can't hold on to it. 
[00:18:30]  They'll slide all the way down, miss the wild card spot, and that'll be that.  Unbelievable.  And really fast, got to say hi to Big Ray, recuperating.  One of the Philly crew is recuperating from a little tumor surgery.  Wow.  In his noggin.  Ow!  But doing very well, and he's using this show and Ron and Fez's show to recoup.  Don't use this show.  No, it's the last thing you need.  It's just nonsense.  We're not very sympathetic. 
[00:19:00]  Nah, he's doing all right, though.  And then the Yankees played their last game at Yankee Stadium.  Anyone see that last night?  No.  Some of the festivities, it was puke-inducing.  It was disgusting.  You know what I liked, though?  I was really surprised, actually, at how humble Reggie Jackson was.  Yeah.  Because I heard him interviewed on ESPN radio when I was going downtown, and I saw him talking  when I came back up on another show, and he was great.  But I watched a little bit of it.  Oh, I was waiting for you to go real humble and then say something he said that was not 
[00:19:30]  humble at all.  No, no, he was, though.  He was?  Okay.  I know, I usually would have used a little misdirection there, but I'm actually just  telling the truth, which is always fun to do on a comedy show.  Well, he's...  Bore everyone with...  You know, Jimmy, he's humble because time's getting the best of him.  People don't really know Reggie like they used to know Reggie, the younger kids and stuff.  I was reading an article in the paper, and he was saying something like, you know, you  tell everyone that you saw Reggie, you know, the guy that hit three homers in that World  Series game, you know, Mr. October. 
[00:20:00]  Sure, because I don't think, you know, time takes care of all that.  Eventually, you know, they don't remember as much, and that's where you start getting  humble, you know?  Travis was saying that it was...  Travis wrote an email last night, so I quickly turned on the Yankee game.  They were doing some weird crap, man.  They introduced the starting lineup of the first game ever played at Yankee Stadium.  The problem is...  Yeah, that's a big problem. 
[00:20:30]  They're all dead.  They're all long dead.  Not only are they dead, their kids are dead.  Their kids' kids are dead.  Their great-great-great-grandchildren are dead.  Were they zombies?  Dead, dead, dead, dead.  Did zombies walk out on the field and start biting into the necks of the fans?  Dude, they didn't even acknowledge...  That's great with that.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  How great would it be if the Yankees just went for broke, and they announced the first  one, like, Bob Dickey, or whoever it was, and the Yankees just wheeled out a coffin  into the middle of the infield?  And just dump it over so that the skeleton just falls out, the jaws all, like, askew. 
[00:21:00]  With a dusty Yankee hat on, Yankee logo on the top of the coffin.  They just throw the ancient corpses of them all out on the field.  No, you bring the coffins out with ads on the side, like Modell's ads.  What?  I thought the people would like it.  Imagine they don't tell anyone in attendance that they've decided to turn the old Yankee  stadium into, like, a graveyard.  We're just going to rebury all the Yankee greats here tonight in front of your horrified 
[00:21:30]  faces.  But they go, uh, they announced, like, the starting lineup of the first game in Yankee  stadium, and it's like, uh, Lou Gehrig, right?  And then Lou Gehrig ran out onto the field.  It was a Field of Dreams dump thing.  But how did Lou Gehrig run out?  He was just some dude in his 30s that got to play the part of Lou Gehrig last night.  Was he wearing the oldie uniform?  Yes.  Yeah, they had, like, the early players had the early Yankee uniform, and then when, like, 
[00:22:00]  quote-unquote, Joe DiMaggio came out, he had his Joe DiMaggio uniform on, and they  had bats.  They were bringing bats out onto the field.  They were ready to play.  Oh, yeah.  And they announced the starting lineup of the first game ever, and they made them stand  way the F in center field.  Yeah.  Way the F out there.  And then they announced, like, you know, the great players of every position.  It took an hour.  I'm sitting there watching this thing.  It took an hour.  Yeah.  And, of course, Mickey Mantle's dead, so they're announcing, you know, Mickey Mantle and 
[00:22:30]  all his accomplishments and all the great things he did in baseball and as a Yankee, and  then, you know, representing Mickey Mantle, his son, Dave Mantle, who looks a lot like  Mickey Mantle, looks like he has a drinking problem like his dad did, but doesn't have  the accomplishments his father had.  Did he throw out his liver?  That would have been good if he just takes the mixed liver from the pitcher's mound and  throws it to the catcher.  It was kind of weird, to say the least. 
[00:23:00]  They're making such a big to-do over this.  Well, it's finally over.  The only good thing was they obviously made it so that Bernie Williams would be the last  person introduced.  And even though I hate the Yankees, that's kind of cool because he hasn't gone back to  the stadium since they refused to resign him.  Right.  So just the fact that, you know, he was cool enough to actually go on the last day.  Well, how did, like, Joe Torre not get the invite? 
[00:23:30]  I know, you know, he's there with the Dodgers and everything.  I'm sure he was invited.  Wouldn't that be?  Mattingly wasn't there.  Even though it's like his first, you know, his first season with the Dodgers and stuff,  he was such an important part of the Yankees for so many years and so many of those championships,  you'd think he would have been there just as a, not as a, hey, you know, I don't like  being with the Dodgers, but just kind of a, you know, he's part of the, a big part of  what the Yankees were.  He's probably working.  He probably couldn't.  Mattingly wasn't there.  What?  I think in the end, you know, the Yankee thing wasn't a big deal to him. 
[00:24:00]  Maybe that's it.  That's what I got to think.  They should at least send his prostate.  His brother Frank we had to hear about for 10 years.  Yeah, all right.  Enough about Frank.  Wave at everyone to get it.  It was, it was, I don't know.  It seemed like the fans were really enjoying it.  There was a lot of tears in the stands and a lot of picture taking and it was, I guess  it was interesting to watch for the.  It was a giant waste of time.  You really thought so?  Yeah, I watched every minute of it and I didn't go to sleep till midnight and I could have 
[00:24:30]  gone to bed at 11 if they didn't have that.  Why would you watch the actual.  It's only an hour early.  Why would you have watched the actual game?  Just because it's the last game in Yankee Stadium?  Because I'm an Oriole fan and I was hoping that they beat him.  Did I miss the Thurman Munson-Corey Lytle commemorative mid-air crash?  That would have been good over the stadium.  Well, Travis Barker took care of that over the weekend.  What's up with these private jets going down, man?  Ah, the thing blew a tire on the runway.  But that's the crashes that are happening in America. 
[00:25:00]  It's the private jets going down, not commercial airlines.  Well, knock wood there.  Of course, knock wood.  You had a stat a couple weeks ago saying, what, we went a year without any major problems or  something like that?  Yeah, it was a year without a major airline crash.  But these private jets, they go down all the effing time.  I think a lot of people are using them a lot more these days for travel instead of commercial.  And, uh, I don't know.  Hey, you know, I'm all for, uh, I'm all for equal opportunity for people. 
[00:25:30]  I'll tell you that.  Oh, boy.  Let me just tell you.  That means you don't like some broad out there.  I'm all for equal opportunity for everybody.  What broad don't you like?  But I know when I'm sitting in my aircraft waiting to go somewhere, and the pilot steps  on and, uh, does not have a penis.  I feel a little, um, I don't feel as good about it.  I know a lot of the pilots, especially some of the older codgers, they've been in combat. 
[00:26:00]  They've been, uh, uh, you know, they're, they're all fighter pilots.  Well, they've been, you know, in one of the Gulf Wars, something like that.  Well, that's what they do when they get out.  They go into the commercial, uh, uh, industry.  A lot of Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam vets.  Yeah, they're getting a little old, but the, the Gulf guys, you know, the Gulf guys, the  Gulf guys, uh, so I see, uh, in the paper, it was, uh, her name was Sarah, I guess it  was, um, Sarah was, uh, the pilot in this Learjet and, uh, not that it was her fault. 
[00:26:30]  I'm just saying like they, the, apparently the tire blew, the front tire blew out.  They were doing about 97 miles an hour on takeoff and, uh, boy, that's probably the  worst time you could, uh, have a blowout.  Um, just didn't have enough speed, too much speed to stop, not enough to take off with  and it crashes.  Yeah.  But, uh, yeah, I can't, I can't, I don't know.  There's some people when I see them get in that cockpit, I get the heebie-jeebies.  There's people of certain, and call me ignorant, call me stupid, I don't care, but there's 
[00:27:00]  certain people of certain ethnic backgrounds, uh, that, uh, stereotypically can't drive,  let's say.  I don't like seeing that in the cockpit.  It's a cockpit, for God's sake.  It says it right in the name.  But what was she supposed to do?  What?  Very good.  Sorry.  I don't know.  I, you know.  I barreled right along.  Goose that thing.  As you were setting up a fine line.  Yeah, well, if the tire's blown, you, you think a, a male pilot would have figured it 
[00:27:30]  out?  Oh, figure that out.  He's flipping sweet.  He knows his tire's been shot out before.  Yeah.  All right.  Ah, you Iraqi, I'm still taking off.  You think he just yells, I was hoping something like this would happen.  Thank God, some excitement for once.  I've been, and he takes off, barely clears the trees.  I've been bored with the regular takeoffs.  Yeah.  They, like, ran off the runway, hid, uh, uh, an embankment on a highway.  Oof.  Yeah, like that Concord plane.  And that tire blew, they handled that well. 
[00:28:00]  Ouch.  That stupid French.  Oh, my.  You just look up, it's 100 feet above you on fire.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  Never good.  Well, what about this Travis Barker, this DJ AM, though, man?  You heard what happened?  The only reason they survived was because they were thrown from this thing.  Yeah.  On fire.  Ow.  Did they go into a tuck and roll?  Because then they.  I heard they started taking their burning clothes off.  Well, after they were thrown from the burning wreckage when it crashed, then they're running,  taking their clothes off, like Ann said. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  And running away from the wreckage.  And survived this thing.  That's, that's unbelievable.  And you just, your hair is smoking, you're at the desk going, I need a connecting flight  now.  You owe me.  You just, imagine that the first thing, before any medical attention, you go to the desk and  just start making a stink.  I have to get somewhere.  The one guy got burned, the DJ got burned on the scalp and somewhere else, and then Barker  got burned on the chest.  Yeah.  The torso and lower, the bottom.  Just amazing, amazing stuff. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, we got to bring Sam in here.  We're doing something special today.  Hey.  What are we doing, Sam?  I, I still don't understand this.  Well, I was at the NBC premiere party on Thursday.  Oh, how was that?  It was great.  Yeah?  Yeah, they set up, uh, for all the different radio stations, there was a big picture of  Steve Dahl, and then Steve Dahl was there.  And then a big picture of the junkies, and then the junkies were there.  Uh-huh.  And then there was a big picture of Opie and Anthony, and I was there.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  We, we couldn't be bothered with that.  Well, it was a fun time.  I mean. 
[00:29:30]  You should have come.  NBC knows how to treat people, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  You mean the hosts of the radio shows were all there except for us?  Adam Carolla was inside doing his show, all the CBS people.  And he was surprised we're the only ones that didn't show up?  Because we hate being with other radio shows.  Except for Ron and Fez, obviously.  It's not very much fun.  We, we, we've done quite a few of those little things.  Yeah.  So we sent Sam out there, who's more than capable of, uh, doing the heavy lifting as  far as this goes.  Yeah.  And I got to talk to some of the stars of NBC's hit shows that are going to be 
[00:30:00]  premiering this week.  Ah!  Which was exciting.  Yeah.  And, uh, basically we, it's not that we're obligated to, it's that I think we should,  uh, cover maybe like one show per hour or something like that.  All right.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, you got a couple of clips, uh, some quick clips of some of the people you were  interviewing from, uh, the NBC premiere party.  Yeah.  Who do you want to do, uh, this hour?  Well, The Office is a big show.  Let's talk about The Office.  Well, that's true.  Big show.  Yeah.  Love The Office.  Me too.  I'm just waiting for, uh, season three, man. 
[00:30:30]  Ricky Gervais.  No.  What?  No, The Office.  It's, uh, season five.  Season five.  Starts this week on NBC.  Oh, Steve Carell?  Steve Carell.  Oh!  The American one.  See, we're fans of the, uh, other one.  American one.  Yeah, me too.  The American one.  No, no.  I like that Ricky Gervais.  No, that makes it very uncomfortable.  He's a very uncomfortable man.  Yeah, and the NBC one's also great.  Which premieres this week.  Season five.  Right after My Name is Earl.  All right.  Another good show. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, yes.  And who did you talk to?  Well, uh, I first got to talk to Stanley and Phyllis from The Office, and I, uh.  Stanley's like the bald-headed dude, right?  Yeah, he's the.  Yeah, I know a little bit.  And Phyllis is the ugly broad with the glasses.  Okay.  Right?  She's a nice woman.  She's ugly, though, right?  She's not, like, you know, a model.  But she's a bit, I guess, larger than other actresses.  Would you call them the stars of the show?  Yeah.  Stanley and Phyllis?  I, uh.  Wow, they really, uh.  I was thinking maybe Steve Carell. 
[00:31:30]  Look, we start low, and then we go high, right?  Who's the other guy?  Rainn Wilson or whatever?  Yeah, yeah.  See, I know a little bit about The Office.  Did you get to talk to Rainn Wilson?  Rainn Wilson, no.  Dwight, he's my favorite character.  Yeah, Dwight's a great character.  He's hilarious.  He's one of those elements that makes the show special.  So they pulled out all the stops.  All right, so what track is the Rainn Wilson interview?  No, not Rainn Wilson.  I said Stanley and Phyllis.  All right, how about.  Was it a choice between them and one of the unnamed warehouse black guys?  No.  Stanley and Phyllis are big stars. 
[00:32:00]  They've been on every episode, five seasons, big laughs.  You know what?  Patrice was on The Office.  You could have went to Jersey City, and you didn't have to go to LA.  He would have gave me an exclusive interview about The Office.  He's been on The Office.  All right, why don't we go right to the meat and potatoes?  Let's do the Steve Carell track.  Which one is that?  No, there's no Steve Carell track.  What?  No, Steve Carell wasn't there.  Jenna Fisher was there.  She's a big star.  She was in Walk Hard.  It's a big movie.  That was terrific.  Yeah, it was good.  She's going to be on season five of The Office.  So we got Stanley and Phyllis.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  They're very funny people.  How many scenes do they have in season five?  Like three?  Per episode at least.  Per episode.  You're saying I'm talking to Stanley and Phyllis from The Office.  I'm here with Phyllis and Leslie from The Office.  Howdy.  At the NBC premiere party.  What's the haps?  Well, what's happening?  We're going into season five.  We've got Emmy nominations.  We premiere next Thursday.  What else is going on with us, Phyllis?  We're just having a grando.  Good time.  Of course we are.  Oh, good time. 
[00:33:00]  Thank God.  Can I tell you, you might be the two funniest characters on the show.  Might be.  Liar!  No, I like...  What's wrong with you?  Stanley and Phyllis.  I was trying to do some hardball interviews out there in L.A.  But they're the two of the funniest characters?  They're very funny.  That show is stacked with funny people.  That's what I'm saying.  So many funny people.  A fifth season premiering this Thursday.  Why would you say they're the funniest characters, though, there?  Because, I mean, Stanley's expressions.  Plus, since he's the representative black guy on the show, there's all the racism angles 
[00:33:30]  going on with him and Michael.  Very funny stuff.  Oh, he's the blackballed guy?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought he was the whiteballed guy.  I swear to God.  That's what I thought, too.  I thought it was the big, kind of soft-spoken, fat, white guy.  And I was like, he sounds black when he's not on the show.  Well, he is black.  Oh, oh.  His real name is Leslie.  Leslie.  All right.  Let's continue with this exclusive interview from Sam. 
[00:34:00]  You say that to everybody.  No, you can ask this engineer guy.  I didn't say it to anyone else here.  I consider both of you the unsung heroes of the office.  Unsung heroes?  Unsung heroes?  You dummy.  It's sung.  I have a weird accent.  Thank you.  Oh, we love you.  Love you.  Love you.  Yes, the subtle things are what it's all about.  That's us.  We're subtle.  Yes.  Listen to this.  We used to think it was mute, but now we call it awful banter. 
[00:34:30]  This is horrible banter.  We're just laughing at having a ball.  Three friends having a drink somewhere.  Well, this is what it was.  It wasn't a media event.  It was a party.  Yeah.  You guys are all having fake fun.  Just making me believe you're all having a good time.  Yeah.  No one wants to be there.  We're all excited about the one hour special of the office coming up this Thursday night.  I don't want NBC to be confused here.  I love the office.  Yes.  I just don't love doing these junkets, and that's why we sent you. 
[00:35:00]  I love the junkets.  So they're called junkets.  You can take the audio and junk it.  And I used to do this back in the day.  We were go-getters.  And then you realize, wow, these people have nothing to say.  Yep.  No, what are you talking about?  Oh, I'm so excited.  Oh, we won another Emmy.  What did you hear?  Season five has surprises.  Having a good time.  Having a good time.  Having a great time.  This is a great time.  No, they can't wait to go have lunch.  Everybody was having fun.  And you can't wait to go get some martinis.  Stanley was like, oh, you call it subtleties. 
[00:35:30]  I thought it was mute.  Because he's saying.  Right, right, right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I got it.  Well, the great interview with Stanley continues here.  And Phyllis.  Sam continues gushing about how great Stanley is about keeping a straight face.  Yeah.  Because that's what he does on The Office.  Yeah, he delivers those dry lines with a straight face.  And they're all so funny.  How many lines does he get a year?  Five?  A year?  It's per episode.  He's a big player on the show.  Yeah, you see him in the background a lot. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  You see him in those scenes where, like, Steve Carell is doing something funny.  He'll be in the background.  He had a whole episode last season where he almost quit.  You know what he is?  He's like one of the sweat hogs in Welcome Back, Cotter that were in the back of the classroom.  He's in the opening credits and everything.  Yeah, I think Anthony's on to something.  Remember Happy Days?  They'd have to fill up those boots with people.  Yeah, yeah.  At Arnold's.  At Arnold's.  He's one of those guys. 
[00:36:30]  He's one of those boots, you know.  Nobody had done their making this filler.  Yeah.  They're, you know, and they're clueless that a whole play is being acted out in front of  them.  They're just eating their hamburgers and french fries.  Yeah, everyone else is talking really loud.  Right.  But you can't hear them.  Right.  No.  They do one-on-ones with Stanley and Phyllis.  Do they?  Storylines just for them.  I'm sure you're really going to get into the important questions with Stanley from the  office here.  The hardest part of our job is to keep us straight things.  And Phyllis.  Yeah.  And believe me, something really hard.  Can you rewind that open? 
[00:37:00]  That's really insightful.  I don't want to gloss over that.  No, no.  She really let us in on a little something.  I'm unmasking, Phyllis.  Yeah, this was great.  Unmasking.  The hardest part of our job is to keep a straight face.  Yeah.  And believe me, some days it's really hard.  Yeah.  But what about the other days, Phyllis?  It's really hard to keep a straight face.  Of course.  What happened?  Oh, good gravy.  Some days it's really hard.  Do you guys think she'll be able to keep a straight face on Thursday when it premieres? 
[00:37:30]  Hopefully, as Rampage is drilling a spit into it.  The UFC tie-in.  And some days, we don't keep straight faces.  We fall out on the floor.  Yeah.  I've often wondered if Stanley always has a straight face because he's very bored.  Not always.  When you see the edited version, Stanley has a straight face.  But most of the time, Stanley is really laughing.  And I have to turn my personality off. 
[00:38:00]  I do wonder how you can pull that off.  Like you did for this interview.  How could you not keep a straight face?  Yeah.  Unless it's, what's not a straight face?  Our face is contorted with sleep.  Boo.  Quality off.  I do wonder how you can pull that off.  Just the straight face.  Low fiber diet.  I see.  Okay.  Well, that makes sense.  No, it doesn't.  You hate actors.  How does that make sense, Sam?  He said, you said, I always wonder how you keep a straight face. 
[00:38:30]  And he said, low fiber diet.  And you went, oh, that makes sense.  How did it make sense, Sam?  Comment?  Well, you know, I didn't necessarily think it all the way through.  I thought we were just kind of going back and forth with some jokes.  Ah.  So that was like a sympathy comment for a really bad, unfunny line.  No.  It was like, yeah, I get it.  Are you trying to tell us that you were starstruck because you were looking at Stanley from the office?  How many?  Do you guys have pictures with Stanley?  And Phyllis?  No, I have a picture with Steve Carell, to be honest with you. 
[00:39:00]  Well, not all of us have that picture.  And with Ricky Gervais.  I'll wait until it's on TV, get near my TV, and have someone take a picture of me and the TV.  Yeah.  Well, he's on it a lot.  He's one of the big stars of the office.  You can do it on Thursday.  Yeah.  I bet not.  Lucky us.  We have this instead of commercials today.  Less commercials so we can do this.  Yeah.  Good news.  I don't want it to be confused out there, though.  We love the office on NBC.  Oh, yeah.  The NBC fall lineup is huge this year.  I bet that network, number one. 
[00:39:30]  Easy.  We love Sam's What's the Haps.  Yeah.  But this is a recipe for disaster.  This should be What's the Saps?  And it's every guest.  No.  Hey, Sam talks to Jenna Fisher and Angela Kinsey.  Those are both big stars.  They're from the office who interviews themselves.  Then Sam forgets his question and awkwardly doesn't want to eat a snack.  So Jenna Fisher is the broad behind the reception desk.  She plays Pam.  Pam.  And who's Angela Kinsey?  She plays Angela.  Is she the blonde?  Yes.  Oh, she's another nobody. 
[00:40:00]  No, she's not a nobody.  She had the whole thing with Dwight.  You know, she's involved in a love triangle now.  She was seeing Dwight for a while, right?  Yeah.  I remember that.  Then she proposed to the other guy, but then at the end of the season she was making out with Dwight,  so we got a cliffhanger involving Angela.  Yeah.  I can't wait to find out what's happening with her on Thursday.  She's pretty ugly in person, too.  No, she's not.  So the Junkets are basically all the people that, like, Leno won't take or Letterman.  Exactly.  Craig Ferguson.  Right.  So they got to get them pressed somehow. 
[00:40:30]  So the radio scum, they throw the ones that they can't get on a quote-unquote legitimate show.  Ant and I have got a bunch of these, man.  Oh, boy.  A bunch of morning zoos just lined up.  And you hear, hey, you know who's going to be there?  And then they give you a couple of big celebrity names.  And then when you get there, they're not there.  No.  They're never there.  Christian Slater was.  Oh.  I like him, but.  He's got a new series.  Yeah.  That he's promoting.  And I guess it's very important to him, so that's why he was there.  Right.  Somebody in an established show, like, let's say, oh, Steve Carell. 
[00:41:00]  Well, they were filming the next day, so I'm sure probably Rain and Steve either had some  kind of late night scenes or very early scenes.  Or just scenes.  Yeah.  Well, no.  Unlike the people you spoke with.  Right.  Who can sleep in the next day, I guess.  Right.  Yeah.  No.  3 p.m. call time.  Yeah.  As you're talking to Stanley and Phyllis, the rest of the cast of The Office is actually  filming an episode.  Right.  You know, and then they just added these losers in the background. 
[00:41:30]  No, because I did see Stanley and Phyllis on the Emmy red carpet last night, so they  were there.  Well.  They don't just invite anybody to the Emmys.  All right.  Well, here's the last clip, thank God.  What?  As Sam talks to the, what, the lower-rung characters of The Office.  Jenna Fisher.  Well, she's a biggie, sure.  I feel the best when I can make Steve break, and it only happened twice in our whole time  shooting, and it happened last year, and I'm still a high.  How much of a boar is she?  She's not a boar. 
[00:42:00]  Wow.  If Carell breaks every time he's on TV, he's cracking up and laughing and losing it.  You know, you ask them how they keep a straight face.  Do they ask you how you keep opened eyes during their conversation?  Jenna Fisher was wonderful to talk to.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who is she?  She plays Pam on The Office.  She's Pam.  And she was in Walk Hard.  You've never seen The Office, the English version?  It is.  She plays Pam.  Who is the love interest?  Of Jim.  Of Jim.  Of Jim.  Oh, so was she there with Jim?  Jim wasn't there. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, Jim wasn't there.  No.  Yeah.  But Pam was.  Yeah, that would have been a nice dynamic.  Stanley and Phyllis were there.  Well, we heard that.  Pam is probably the fifth most popular character on The Office.  No.  Phyllis is eight or nine.  Stanley's maybe seven.  I had Stanley and Phyllis at one and two, as you heard in the last interview.  I'm shooting.  And it happened last year, and I'm still high from it.  That's awesome.  Which moment was that?  It was the moment when Jim and I are kissing, and he's making, like, porno music sounds. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  And I turned, and I looked at him, and he just started cracking up.  Because he said, the look on my face honestly looked like I wanted to stab him in the face.  That's awesome.  That's not awesome.  Oh, look.  More tasty morsels.  Enjoy yourselves.  We're just here to hang out.  I had a question in my head, but your snacking threw me off.  I'm sorry.  But it's not your fault.  It's my fault.  You know what?  We'll get it in post.  Yeah, exactly.  Do you want a snack?  Do you want one of these morsels?  No.  No, I'm fine.  Are you sure?  I got my water.  How are they?  Really good.  What were they eating besides minutes of my life doing this? 
[00:43:30]  It looks too complicated.  Dude, you just got to put the whole thing in your mouth.  That's what she said.  That's what she said.  Oh, snap.  Oh, Danny.  Oh, damn.  Just a few bonbons and the girls get kind of randy.  They say that on The Office a lot.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's like kind of a running gag.  Right.  And we'll see if it continues Thursday night with the one-hour season premiere.  Wow.  Thursday night, one-hour season premiere of The Office.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Where you can see all the people that Sam talked to at some point.  All the people that Sam didn't interview.  Yeah.  And all the ones, Stanley, Phyllis, Pam, and Angela, I'm sure will.  All right.  You know what your job is?  What?  The hour premiere of The Office.  I want to know exactly how much camera time Stanley and Phyllis will be getting.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  I'm sure it'll be plentiful.  I want to watch it just to see these two flops not have a good line.  Nothing.  They always have good lines. 
[00:44:30]  They'll give a look into the camera for like a split second.  Right.  All right.  You can go home.  You know what, Stanley, I want to see interviewed?  Stanley Kowalski and Blanche right after the rape.  When Ant and I had an interview with Stanley and Phyllis's back in the day, we would be  like, all right, let's just get this over with.  We interviewed the two mommies or the two moms or whatever they were.  From a show that no one remembers.  No one remembers.  But I do believe they were the Reynolds rap girls, right?  Yeah.  They were the same women that do the Reynolds rap commercials. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Now they're hooking on Sunset Boulevard.  The times are tough.  And Sam, these interviews are bringing me right back.  Yeah.  I've got to be honest.  It was a good, exciting, fun time.  For who?  For me.  For the people that didn't go.  Okay.  And isn't it nice to be young and eager?  Oh, I know.  And full of motivation.  And with an afro.  I remember those days.  I remember being just like you.  It's cute. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  It's cute.  What was your opening line to Christian Slater?  Did you go, so, no one's heard from you since True Romance.  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  What's the haps?  Actually, this new show he's doing has a lot of buzz, so that would have been inaccurate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the last people you just talked to, I hope this gets better, because that was  What's the Craps?  Oh.  I think it wasn't quite up to par.  I don't know about that.  Well, it's not your fault.  No fault of yours, Sam.  Yeah, I don't think Sam.  I'm a big Sam fan.  I don't think Sam should get the abuse.  He's doing his job.  He's just talking to dollars. 
[00:46:00]  He can't help it.  They're throwing crap at him.  No.  Here, here's crap.  You know, sculpt something nice out of it.  Yeah.  Call it What's the Taps, because that's the music that I can play.  Yeah.  That's what we're going to do.  What's the next interview later on in the show?  I figure later on we can talk.  How many of these do we have to do?  God help us.  Well, I think we should do like three, you know?  Yeah.  We don't have to.  You know, it's just.  Oh, well, what do you mean?  It's just banter.  This is great stuff.  Well, which one are we going to do next? 
[00:46:30]  The Biggest Loser, My Name Is Earl.  We'll do Biggest Loser.  All right, we'll do that later next hour.  Thank you, Sam.  My pleasure.  I hope you enjoyed L.A.  Ugh.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  I say let him think he sucks.  What happened?  I say let him think he sucks.  Yeah.  Well, Sam's interview.  The lines are coming in.  They're hilarious.  Oh, really?  Scott from Hop Hog has a great line. 
[00:47:00]  Where's that instant feedback?  Give that to me real fast.  There's some brain.  Sorry.  I was going to save it, but Scott from Hop Hog writes,  Is this Sam's new bit?  What's the point?  That's a good one.  What's the point?  I actually can't wait to do another segment with Sam today.  That's all I want to do today is go over his awful interviews.  Awful?  His interviewing style is good.  The problem is he had to interview zeroes. 
[00:47:30]  Where's the leads?  Right.  What are you going to call it?  Eighth-ranked players.  And this has always been my argument because they wanted to fly us out to L.A.  and do the whole thing.  And I did a little research.  I'm like, all right, so we're going to talk to Steve Carell and Rainn Wilson from the office.  Oh, well, not exactly.  And I'm like, well, if it's not important enough for the stars of the show to be there,  then why the F should the stars of our radio show be there?  Why don't we have the zeroes from our show interview the zeroes from these big NBC shows? 
[00:48:00]  That's what they wanted to do, send the zeroes to us.  Hey, there was another great line that we missed.  We were talking about the last game at Yankee Stadium last night,  and they brought out the original lineup of the first game.  I'm not the original.  They announced the first lineup of the first game.  Does that make sense?  Yes.  At Yankee Stadium.  I'm sorry.  I'm all over the place.  And they had, like, stand-ins walk out dressed as those Yankees. 
[00:48:30]  And the line was, did E-Rock get the call to play Babe Ruth?  Oh, hokey boy.  Ah, that's good.  God, the listeners are the best.  877-212-0&A.  Also, by the way, how funny was it when stupid Willie Randolph slid in a second and hurt himself?  Why are you trying to have a moment, idiot?  Just walk out there like everybody else.  He hurt himself. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, you didn't see that?  No.  He tried to slide in and just have a moment, and he hurt himself.  Oh, good.  What, did he pull a hamstring or something, or a groin muscle?  He slid out too hard, and he jumped up, and you could see he was really hurt.  I was kind of happy.  Oh, that's funny.  Good.  Actually, he wasn't trying to slide whatsoever, Jimmy.  It was all the Mets fans in attendance throwing stuff at him.  He had a duck.  He has to be happy to be away from that anchor right now, though, because it's not his fault  they're losing.  You know, he's rooting against them.  He has to be. 
[00:49:30]  We'll get the wild card.  Oh, Billy, Billy.  Hey, also, for the hardcore listeners, we've got the casual listeners.  They don't even know whose voice is who.  They don't even know what we do.  They just tune in every once in a while.  Occasionally, they go, oh, that's interesting.  Yeah, the doorman in my building, Steve, he likes when we just talk sports.  Please come in.  He likes when we talk sports, everything else he could give a crap about. 
[00:50:00]  But when we do the sports break, see, he's right there with us.  Yeah.  This is for the ones that like to dig really deep on the show.  Intern Dave gets terrified on Opie and Anthony.  The YouTube video is up for your viewing pleasure.  There was a lot of pixelation going on because we don't want YouTube to yank the video.  But basically, Intern Dave fooling around with Lisa Sparks, the porn star.  And then we made Intern Dave believe that there was a jealous husband that came barging into  the studio right in the middle of him having a lot of fun with her. 
[00:50:30]  Can we bring it up?  Can we bring it up?  Yeah.  I just want to see something.  But the video is up.  If you go to YouTube, it's Intern Dave Gets Terrified on Opie and Anthony.  All right?  Yeah.  Let's take a look.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  Just curious?  Just, yeah.  A little curious about something.  What?  The web is slow.  Is it?  Yeah.  The web is slow.  Slow, huh?  More than slow.  What happened, Jimmy?  No, no.  The internet is all screwy today.  Oh, okay.  It's really bad.  Or people on Pal Talk that got the show for nothing are all upset. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, really?  Well, of course they are.  Why wouldn't they be?  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  We got to address something.  And Anthony decided to spill his guts on the great Ron and Fez radio show.  Ron and Fez show.  For some reason.  No one to three on Exxon, by the way.  Yeah, Friday.  We got done with the show Friday.  And then it's Friday.  Yeah.  So hang out a little bit with the Ron and Fezsters. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  And then I get on there.  You know, you start talking with Ronnie and Fez.  Dave is in there and everything.  And, you know, you just start spilling stuff out.  Well, what's amazing is like.  I didn't mean stuff.  I mean beer.  Yeah.  They spill it out into my mouth.  Well, Ronnie, you know, he makes it very easy for you.  There's beer there waiting for you.  Yeah.  You have a couple of beers on a Friday, you know.  And then you start opening up about things.  And we have to talk in code. 
[00:52:00]  About things.  There's the things.  Two big things.  Lovely things.  Oof.  Here you go.  Oh, you missed it.  Look.  Oh, yeah.  He hurt himself.  There's Willie sliding into us.  All right.  Hey.  Stupid Willie.  So, but what I don't understand, I'm sitting there at home listening to the whole thing.  And it was great radio.  I can't deny that.  And I'm sitting there going, why wouldn't Anthony want to do this on his own radio show?  Why? 
[00:52:30]  I do.  Like the whole, when the whole relationship with her.  Jill.  Jill.  Started.  You broke the news on Laszlo's show.  In the middle of the night.  I'm like, why wouldn't he do it on our show?  And then all the controversy of the breakup.  I'm like, why wouldn't he, like, do it on his show?  I have certain inhibitions that go away with alcohol.  It's not really an odd thing.  It happens to a lot of people.  Stunk brain.  Go get some alcohol immediately.  See, that's just it.  I can't drink this early.  Immediately. 
[00:53:00]  I cannot drink this early.  I'm like, this is great radio.  But after all these years, you would think he knows how to do radio.  You know, it's one of those things.  Like I said, the inhibitions kind of slip away a little bit.  You're willing to talk about a little more.  That's how people get laid in bars.  Right.  It's just, it's the same principle.  And for the last month or so, I've been trying to push you and nudge you a little bit.  Yeah, I've been taking my time, waiting a little, you know, letting time go by.  And hinting that you have a great story to tell. 
[00:53:30]  And you would give me these looks like, no, I'm not ready.  I'm like, all right.  And then I have to hear it.  I'm running fast.  And I'm texting Anthony.  I'm like, do you understand the TSL we'd get for this?  I'm giving them all the inside radio terminology.  Yeah, I know.  Bring in the beer, E-Rock.  Yes, bring in the beer.  There you go.  There you go.  Look at that.  I would never drink that.  I could not drink that.  First of all.  Remember that sponsor?  Do you remember that sponsor?  They're like, wee-wee.  Huh?  It's not very cold. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  I'm drinking warm beer.  No.  First of all, I'm not drinking beer at this hour.  I have a meeting with our agent later.  Oh.  When you said meeting, me and Jimmy went, oh, finally.  Oh, thank God.  He finally decided.  I'll take you.  I'll take you.  We'll leave the show right now.  Just give the word.  That is cold.  Oh, I bet that would taste good.  No, I'm not drinking beer on a Monday at friggin' seven in the morning.  Anyone else hear that Anthony's just fighting with himself? 
[00:54:30]  No, I'm not going to drink the beer.  I felt the aluminum bottle.  Nice.  The Bud Light aluminum bottle.  And it's icy cold.  This would taste really good.  Yeah.  At, you know, noon-ish.  Bill from Waterford, he says it.  He goes, Opie, I honestly think Anthony never likes to open up to you.  How about this?  You could open up to me, and you just be here.  Yeah.  Open up to Jimmy.  No, it has no bearing on it.  Open up to Mike.  It's the beer.  It really is. 
[00:55:00]  You have a couple of beers, and you kind of open up a little bit.  But I can't at this hour.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  There's no way.  I haven't had a beer this early since I woke up or didn't go to sleep from the night before  and was still partying from, like, a Friday to a Saturday.  There you go.  I haven't done that in a long time.  Well, I brought some hot...  When is Tina Fey going to tell us where that goddamn scar came from?  She refuses to.  I know, but, you know, you're too big a star now.  It's got to come out.  I'm just from a car accident. 
[00:55:30]  What?  Shut up.  Nah.  You had me.  It's from something very horrific.  Something happened, because that's like a razor.  And by the way, the other thing...  You know, I'm glad you mentioned that, because I was watching the Emmys, and I saw Tina Fey,  and that's all I was thinking, swear to God.  Yeah.  So, with you saying that...  Where's that come from?  What happened?  And then Christina Applegate.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  She's on stage, and no one wants to acknowledge that she has no boobs.  But she had to.  But there was something going on under the dress.  Yeah, obviously.  And they just made believe that nothing happened to her a month ago. 
[00:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  What?  Oh, the foundry...  Oh, there.  Steve!  Again, with the...  The Opie and Anthony, you can't...  The Opie and Anthony in the script type...  It's scribble at the top.  It's hieroglyphics.  Steve, what is it going to take for you to understand we don't want the effing foundry  logo bigger than the Opie and Anthony logo?  What is it going to take?  Seriously.  Because now it's getting stupid.  I didn't make it any bigger.  I didn't even do that.  All right.  It's your website! 
[00:56:30]  I'll make it smaller.  We've been telling you for months.  Opie and Anthony is the big get, not foundry.  And the big...  Well, the font.  You know, it's a little hard to read the Opie and Anthony thing.  It looks like scribble.  And because the foundry thing is such block letters and it's very easy to see...  And it changed the font and will make it smaller.  You've been saying that for months.  This is getting stupid now, Steve.  It really is.  It's getting stupid now.  That goes about four-fifths of the way across the screen, too.  Maybe even more. 
[00:57:00]  And I'll make it smaller.  It is a fair question, though.  Like, why is it like that?  We can't say either one on this side.  I understand.  So what is the purpose of it, honestly?  I mean...  It is...  It really...  You know, at this point, it doesn't make that much of a difference to put either one of  them up there because...  No, it makes a lot of difference.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  No, I understand that.  Not the...  But the intro...  Website we can't mention show.  And that's what it looks like.  Oh, this is...  It's stupid.  I will make them...  It's all about labeling and marketing, and this is just dumb.  I will make them smaller. 
[00:57:30]  I mean, and more noticeable.  You said that already.  That Opie and Anthony fund is awful.  Yeah, the Opie and Anthony thing is some kind of script thing that...  Who knows what that is?  I don't even believe it, Steve.  You've been saying that for months.  And once again, this is the latest video, and it's a big effing logo for your website.  But I'll...  No, buts.  It's stupid.  And we've been telling you.  A lot of people are going to see it.  It'll be on a bunch of different websites.  It would be with Opie and Anthony, too.  And I love you, man, but I agree with him.  That would be the same if it just said Opie and Anthony at the bottom. 
[00:58:00]  It would be in the same amount of websites.  All right.  Why wouldn't it be on the same amount of websites?  I'm not sure.  Why wouldn't it be on the same amount of websites?  Well, that one specifically, just because of content, I can't put it on some, but...  What, the Opie and Anthony thing?  No, no, no, no, no.  It doesn't do this.  Like, some other websites, if I put it up there, they'll cube out any kind of markings  that are on it.  So...  What I'm saying is, if that's going to...  You just said that's going to end up on a bunch of websites.  So I'm saying, if Opie and Anthony were just at the bottom really clearly, what websites  would it be on now that it wouldn't be on then? 
[00:58:30]  Oh, I should be...  Yeah, some.  Which ones?  Which websites wouldn't have it if it was just Opie and Anthony?  Oh, there's a few.  I don't want to...  I want to know.  We should know.  They haven't been good to us.  If we can't put Opie and Anthony in big letters, then they haven't been good to us.  What?  If Opie and Anthony's bigger, this video...  No, no, no, no.  Just change it.  I'll change it.  We got a radio show.  Just change it.  Like, we've been saying for months.  I'll change it.  I don't want that on any of our videos.  Fine.  I don't want it on our videos. 
[00:59:00]  I just don't.  Any other big show or they don't have to mention a website to have their videos places?  The latest video is Intern Dave Gets Terrified on Opie and Anthony.  And there's a million logos, so hopefully you can see through them to see what's going on.  That was uncomfortable.  Not at all.  Not at all.  It's frustrating.  We've been telling him for months.  It's enough.  I don't need his website to have a successful radio show. 
[00:59:30]  We don't need it.  So what are you doing?  It's just a matter of when anybody sees anything.  A lot of times, you want to have one identifying thing.  It's common sense with anything you do.  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  All right.  Well, so Anthony, anyway, getting back to...  Yes, the Ron and Fez.  Right.  You went on Ron and Fez and you just spilled your guts.  And it was great radio. 
[01:00:00]  It really was.  Yeah, well, it always starts out as something else.  You know, you get brought in, you start talking about things, and then it just kind of...  All of a sudden, you're like, you know what?  I'm feeling comfortable.  It oozes into that.  This is the perfect situation.  And Ronnie's a genius, so he knows, you know, what to say and what buttons to push.  Mm-hmm.  And then before you know it, you're just kind of, you know...  It's unmasked.  There you go.  Anthony unmasked.  That bastard does a good interview, though, man.  He certainly does.  But the next thing you know, you're 20 minutes later, you're like, yes, I knew it was a guy. 
[01:00:30]  Huh?  What happened?  How did this get out?  Oh, no.  So we got some clips of Anthony on Ron and Fez just spilling his guts.  Yeah.  It starts with this one, Danny.  You're with me here?  All right.  Here we go.  I was probably a bad guy.  Not probably.  I was a bad guy.  Right.  And if that was a relationship type thing that had been going on for a while, it was a few months.  But if it was going on for a while, I'd be a really bad guy.  But, you know, obviously I wasn't being honest and forthright. 
[01:01:00]  The real clue to not being honest and forthright is a girl in your closet.  Right.  When you're supposed to be.  Wait a minute.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Can you pause that?  That was.  A girl?  You told us it was a burglar.  Wait a minute.  Oh, dude.  That changes everything.  Okay.  Thank you.  Wow.  That was good.  Uh-oh. 
[01:01:30]  That might cause a problem.  Yeah.  See, that was what did it.  When I heard there's no bigger horror than on your locked double bedroom doors, you hear  open the door, and there's the girl you've been seeing for a while on the other side.  And you look to your left and, well, you're not quite alone.  You know, how do you deal with that one?  So this is what we've been trying to get out of you for probably a month. 
[01:02:00]  This went down in August.  A little longer than a month, I guess.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And, of course, this is describing the breakup of Anthelini.  Oh, yes.  He's in bed with another girl.  Jill's knocking at his bedroom door.  Yeah, that was pretty precarious.  And then it's like, because I said, I said, I didn't want that scene.  I didn't want the scene of the girlfriend walking in and there you are in bed. 
[01:02:30]  Because it reminds me of every bad movie, soap opera, the, oh, my God.  And then you're defenseless because you're nude.  So, like, I had to do something.  So I couldn't just open the door.  So I was just like, what?  Like I was tired and hungover from the night before.  So I'm like, what?  Hold on.  Yeah, I'll get this. 
[01:03:00]  In the meantime, it's like, all right.  Oh, hell, what do I do?  Were you panicking?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Panicky Pete.  First thing, all right, get dressed.  Because you never want to be fight as a naked guy, fight guy.  And then, of course, the young lady also, her clothes were in the closet.  It wasn't so much a hide in the closet thing because I knew the jig was up.  That was it.  And, no, I wasn't sleeping with somebody. 
[01:03:30]  Wow.  No, it was get into the closet.  You know, she decided to get in and get dressed.  That's where the clothes were.  Jill had her suspicions, obviously, because then she'd go home for the night,  and now she's coming back nice and early in the morning.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She must have had some kind of suspicion.  Well, yes.  That she wanted to check on.  There were suspicions.  There were things.  She had taken my Escalade after that.  That was after the whole shenanigans happened.  But, yeah, yeah, she showed up and knocked on the door. 
[01:04:00]  I opened it.  She walked around the room a little bit, opened up the other closet.  There was no one in there, you know.  And then I thought I was in the clear for a second.  I actually thought to myself, oh, good, just one closet.  This is Anne continuing on Rana Fez.  So you, she voluntarily went in the closet.  I have two of these big walk-in closets in the bedroom.  One is supposed to be for the girl.  One's for the guy.  And she went into mine for the clothes wear. 
[01:04:30]  Of course, the girlfriend at the time, she opens the door of the girl's closet.  There's no one in there.  I'm not crazy.  I'm not stashing them all away in closets.  So that one's empty.  And then she didn't go for the other door.  So I thought for a second, I'm like, oh, I'm good.  She's not going for that closet.  So she continued, you know, talking a little and getting mad and everything and what's going on in here kind of a thing.  And whose bra is this thing?  Right.  You know, but I have an excuse for everything.  But you didn't think you'd start walking down the hall? 
[01:05:00]  No, because I didn't want to make it obvious that I was trying to get out of the bedroom.  Right.  That would have been a good move, though.  Yeah.  To leave the bedroom area.  But then I saw her heading toward the other closet.  And I just went, okay, well, this is it.  The jig's up.  Right when I saw that, the hand hit the knot.  It was all slow motion.  No.  And it opened.  And I just saw her face.  She went like, oh.  And then she picked up her camera phone and snapped a picture of the girl in the closet. 
[01:05:30]  She was dressed and everything.  For the website?  Yeah.  Yeah, for the website.  Here's what's new in our relationship.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, knowing a little bit about you, I can't sit here and claim I know a lot about you.  You were probably relieved.  It was kind of a, well, now I don't have to think so much about what I'm going to say next.  Right.  You weren't, yeah, you weren't hoping to save the relationship with Jill.  You knew you wanted to move on from that. 
[01:06:00]  No, it's just very hard to actually, you just didn't want to end it the way most people do,  by saying it's over or, you know, giving them a phone call.  You know what the other problem is?  My stupid family.  Oh, God.  Yeez.  Because they, you know, she's fantastic, Rowe.  We all said it, though.  I know.  We said it.  We did it to you as well.  Everyone, you know, everyone likes her and everything, and, you know, that's fine. 
[01:06:30]  I'm not saying anything like that.  I'm just saying, you know, eh.  You started believing the hype around you.  And I'm like, I was kind of stuck in the hype a little bit, you know, so it prevented me  from doing what I should have done, which is, I guess, be honest, go up and say, look,  you know, it's this way.  I've been in relationships for so long that I'm kind of trying to, you know, wean myself  off of them here.  Yeah.  And I find myself, I'm right back in. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  So, instead of doing that, I decide to go the other route, which is, oh, my God, what's  this girl in the closet?  I'm one extreme or the other, I guess.  You didn't want to be in that situation, but you're also relieved you were in that situation.  Yeah, yeah.  There was an element of weight being lifted off my shoulders.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  And it continues from the Ron and Fez show with Anthony.  And, yeah, so that happened, and then there was a little discussion, a very brief, how 
[01:07:30]  long, I believe, how long have you been s***ing my boyfriend was the question, and then the  answer came out, and, ah, that made a big to-do.  A big to-do.  Yeah, it did make a to-do.  That was one of those, you know, now I'm like, hey.  What do you want from me?  Now they're just discussing things amongst themselves. 
[01:08:00]  They're like, ah, you girls talk.  Now you're out of it.  Yeah.  It's your part.  I'm going to go grab something to eat downstairs.  Yeah.  Were you hoping that there might be a little threesome happening?  Yeah.  At that point, I think the chances of that were pretty slim.  Slim to none.  Imagine being a guy in that situation and going, hey, look, since we're all here in the same  room.  I know there's a lot of anger in this room.  And there's anger.  I think there's a way we could probably deal with it.  Right.  That would be pleasurable to everybody involved. 
[01:08:30]  Why don't we have a put the gun down?  Put the gun down.  But you did do your part.  You made the introduction.  Yes.  Yes.  I made the introduction.  Ooh.  My word.  And then she marched out.  Yeah.  Then there was actually, no, there was a walk downstairs. 
[01:09:00]  And then, of course, Danny and Marissa were asleep on the couch.  Yeah.  Which, well, yeah, asleep.  They weren't asleep.  Danny was up going in his head.  Oh, like, oh, boy.  This ain't good.  You could have given me a heads up, you son of a bitch.  She was right at my door knocking.  You could have been like, Anthony.  It was much too late for that.  Text me.  There was no way I would have beaten her.  Something.  Or how about feigning an illness downstairs?  Oh. 
[01:09:30]  I figured I could just stay on that couch.  And as long as I had my eyes shut, everything was just going to go away.  And I'd be fine.  You needed an escape.  You need, like, an escape ladder, like a rope ladder.  Yes.  That was brought up.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  Okay, because you go down the ladder, then go in the back door and make believe you're  sleeping in another part of this huge house.  I'm all bent up.  I slept in a chair.  It sucks.  Yeah, so Danny was on the couch.  Did you follow her downstairs?  No, it didn't get downstairs yet.  Let's see.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay. 
[01:10:00]  Walked downstairs.  Followed her downstairs.  Big to do.  And she was like, I just want everybody out of here right now.  And I'm like, you know, it's kind of my house.  You know, this place is mine.  Wait, she wanted everyone to leave?  Yeah, she wanted everyone out.  And baby girl.  Yeah, yeah.  And the girl you had.  Right.  Everyone out so we could, like, talk kind of thing.  So I'm like.  That ain't happening.  I knew, no, no, I knew this situation wasn't going to end without that happening. 
[01:10:30]  It was just going to continue and probably escalate.  Because now she's accusing, like, Danny and baby girl of.  Conspiring.  Conspiring, yes.  That's the word I was looking for.  Right.  So I was like, all right, guys, take off.  I'll give you a call later.  This has to be, you know, discussed.  It was discussed for maybe five minutes more.  And then she hopped in my Escalade and drove away in my car. 
[01:11:00]  What the discussion was?  Was it cordial?  No.  No, it wasn't very cordial.  And it wasn't much of a discussion.  It was.  You being yelled at?  It was me being yelled at.  Wait, why wouldn't she just take her own car?  I know.  She had her own car at your house?  Yes.  But jumped in yours after.  Jumped in my Escalade.  And I opened the door and just watched my truck driving down the street.  Oh, my God.  So I'm like.  Ooh.  So now I'm realizing, you know.  I'm thinking, why is that?  So then I realized the next day why that was.  And we'll get into that after the break? 
[01:11:30]  Sure.  We'll do that because we're running a little late.  Yeah.  Yeah, Anthony spilling his guts on Ron and Fez on Friday.  It's some amazing audio.  We'll continue with the audio after the break.  Today's.  Sorry.  I got to do this plug line.  That wasn't me.  Oh, it was them.  Today's show brought to you with limited commercials.  Thanks to NBC and NBC Premier Week.  Man, we got a real busy show today.  Hopey and Anthony.  Sam's going to come back in here in a few minutes with another interview with some lesser players 
[01:12:00]  from some big, big NBC shows.  Lesser players.  Wow.  So they weren't billed that way.  The first interview.  Who did he interview?  I have no idea already.  All right.  There you go.  I forgot the names already.  There you go.  And we're going to have another one.  The bald black guy and the not attractive woman from the office.  They're in the background usually.  What?  He had Jenna Fisher from the office.  For like 30 seconds and she was eating snacks. 
[01:12:30]  And also we got some highlights from Anthony's appearance on the Rana Fez show.  It was a great appearance.  I was home with one eye shut.  The other eye was half shut.  A massive hive on the back of my head.  I was just hiving all over the place listening to you on Rana Fez.  And it was great.  It was great radio.  And you finally spilled your guts about the whole Antellini thing.  The breakup. 
[01:13:00]  You really got into the breakup and how it all went down.  Just before the break we kind of like did the big setup.  She came back to the house.  Went up to your room.  Your doors were locked because you're in there with somebody else.  You try to hide the girl.  Well I wasn't really trying to hide the girl.  It was just the girl had to get dressed.  And was in the closet.  And then you can't just walk out of the closet.  Yes you can.  You can't just walk out.  But while she was in the closet getting dressed you figure.  Well maybe. 
[01:13:30]  I was hoping like maybe I'll skate.  Maybe I could skate this if she doesn't go poking around.  How much were you hoping.  Can you come downstairs I want to talk to you.  Without even.  Well see that was another thing.  I didn't want to go down there because like I said Danny and Marissa were down there.  And you know I didn't want a big scene in front of them either.  Why not?  I don't know.  Coins to yourself.  It's embarrassed.  It's too.  Yeah it's too like.  Yeah.  Who wants that?  Well so then you had the big blowout. 
[01:14:00]  She discovered that you were kind of seeing another girl.  I guess right?  Seeing.  Yeah you know.  Okay.  Having.  Yeah.  Relations.  Doing things.  And right before the break we left it where she got all the info she needed and grabbed  the keys to your Escalade even though she had her car there and took off with your Escalade  and you're sitting there going why is she taking my Escalade?  Why is my truck driving down the street? 
[01:14:30]  Her car is here.  I don't quite understand.  I just figured it was something you know girls do when that happens.  I don't know.  You just run off with the guy's vehicle.  Why?  I don't know.  It's in every country song.  I don't know.  And then you beat it up with a bat or something.  I just assumed.  I was thinking all right.  You know drive it fast or you know take it out on that instead of me. 
[01:15:00]  I don't know.  I didn't know why she was doing it.  Just drag it along the guardrail on the Long Island Expressway.  Yeah something like that.  Well it came back the next day or the day after that.  So it was gone for a couple of days.  I had to drive the other car in.  Well thank God you have like five cars.  Oh yeah I'm a regular John McCain.  Thirteen cars.  No so I had to drive the other vehicle into work and stuff. 
[01:15:30]  But then when my Escalade showed up I wasn't there.  I wasn't home.  Right.  I believe yeah Keith showed up later on.  But do you have a clip about that?  Yeah I actually do.  Oh okay.  You hinted at this for a while.  Oh I did.  We finally get the info out.  Ah.  So a couple days later I guess Jill came back to your house with the Escalade. 
[01:16:00]  And I'm assuming she came to your house to get some stuff.  Get some of her stuff maybe.  Yeah that's what I assumed too.  Because it kind of did make me a little leery that okay she's got my Escalade keys.  But also on that key chain are my house keys.  Yeah.  So that kind of got me like a little ooh okay.  But I'm a very trusting fellow.  You know with certain things.  Right.  Well here's the story continues as Anthony told it on Run at Fez.  Well there was some complications afterwards. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  Because she took off in my truck which was odd.  Because her car was there.  But she took off in my vehicle.  Too bad you can't cancel a truck.  Yeah I tried.  G-M-A-C.  I don't want this lease anymore.  Hello OnStar.  They just turn off the engine from the space.  It sputters out and a girl shows up in the glove compartment.  So she's got your wheels and you're sitting at the house going.  Going what the f***.  Yeah.  So I just waited out. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  But apparently the next day when I came into work she had my keys also.  So she got into my house and gathered up a few things.  Not just her things but some of my things.  And the girl in the closet her stuff was there.  Her clothes and stuff was in a big duffel bag.  And well I got to tell you I got to thank the guy that built my fire pit in the backyard.  Because that is a sturdy little sum bitch.  It held an entire duffel bag of clothes on fire as they burnt to a crisp. 
[01:17:30]  All that was left was maybe a zipper, some rivets and a lot of underwires for bras.  Yeah.  That's just insanity.  Those all got burned.  I mean you're a crazy person at that point.  That is crazy.  That's scary.  Well that's that kind of stuff you see in movies or you read about things like that.  It was a little.  You don't think it's actually going to happen to you.  Yeah.  But you could definitely.  That was the result of a woman scorned. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  Kind of a thing.  And perhaps I should have changed the locks.  Perhaps I should have moved the clothing.  Broken up first.  Broken up first.  Avoided all this.  Mister I don't like confrontation.  Hey.  You know the little things you could have done.  I could turn around and say crap about both of you.  No no I'm not even saying it's wrong.  I'm saying to avoid a police.  Yeah.  I know. 
[01:18:30]  That's what I mean.  But it's not a judgment.  It's just like to make life easier.  Just end the relationship first.  I mean it's difficult though.  No it sounds easy but I don't know.  Yeah.  You're talking to a guy that I'm sitting across from right now that's I don't know.  Relationship could be over for years and there's still something like.  Yeah.  How about you just.  How many times did I say that?  How about you just break up.  Anthony brings it up.  That's where him and I are similar. 
[01:19:00]  I was in a relationship for years and I was like.  After he was out of a relationship.  I was like why am I still in this relationship?  Why don't I just like just leave this relationship?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where we're both very similar.  Why?  It would be so much easier.  I would have been happier.  Yeah.  I stayed in a relationship years of more than I should have.  That's what I've done my whole life.  You know what?  I think there's a lot of guys just like you and I out there doing the same thing though.  It sounds easy to go well relationships over.  All right.  Let's just end this thing. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Just end it.  But I have a lot of extenuating circumstances that made it very difficult for me to just say  look.  It's like this.  It's very difficult to do that.  So I heard that Keith pulled up to your house.  I think you were still working.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wasn't at home going, hey, the lighter fluid's over there.  Yeah.  This is what I heard.  And she was pulling out now in her car and bringing the Escalade back.  Kind of gave Keith a, hey. 
[01:20:00]  Hi, Keith.  Hey.  How you doing?  Just getting a few things.  And she takes off.  And Keith related that he saw smoke coming from your backyard.  Yeah.  So Keith ran into the backyard.  Is this true?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  So Keith runs into the backyard to see that the fire pit is full of clothes.  Because being on the other side of this, the rumors that were swirling around this whole  thing were pretty good.  Oh, I'm sure.  So this was truth. 
[01:20:30]  Smoke coming from the backyard.  Smoke.  Fire pit.  She's taking it off in her car.  Keith's like, what's going on?  He knew something wasn't right.  Yeah.  Sees the fire and runs back there.  So wait, you have this happen and then you leave your house so the other person can come  back?  I'm boggled.  Did I leave?  What?  No, no.  Where were you when the clothes got taken out of the, put in the pit?  Oh, I was doing the show.  I had to do the show.  Oh, and you could, you would have had to leave Keith there or change the locks.  Yeah.  Keith couldn't get there immediately.  Keith got there as soon as he could. 
[01:21:00]  Because, you know, he works too.  Where was the girl?  Not at the house.  All right.  I was going to say, that would have been ugly.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  She stayed somewhere else because I was like, yeah, you don't want to be here if she winds  up coming here to get her stuff or anything like that.  So, so yeah, the house is just open up for pickings.  Wow.  You're lucky that's all that happened.  You're no kidding.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why, you know.  Who was the one that burned down the mansion? 
[01:21:30]  Left eye.  Left eye.  Left eye did it.  Left eye burned down.  Yeah, Fiddy's chick, right?  Fiddy's blaming him, but something went on with Fiddy and his, one of his.  Yeah.  Jared in Boston.  How are you, Jared?  Hey, guys.  Pretty good.  Anthony, I seem to remember when this whole Antolini thing was being forged way back when  that somebody warned you that she was a little crazy when things went wrong.  So it's not like we didn't know this was in common.  Who warned me that?  I don't know.  I seem to remember a caller saying something about a member being glued to a hockey player's 
[01:22:00]  leg or something like that.  Oh, yeah.  There was a story that was told back in the day.  We didn't know if it was true or not.  But it was, yeah.  Didn't know if that one was true, but who knows?  I don't consider closing the fire pit to be that nuts.  No?  Nah.  Look, you walk in like, it's not like you found something.  You walk in like that.  It's like the girls' clothes?  Yeah.  It's my mind.  I gotta tell you, it's a little scary.  It's a little creepy.  People pull pistols for stuff like that.  It's a little creepy, to be honest with you.  I would have burned mine. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, it's better that you didn't do that.  I understand someone felt scorned and all, but that's like, I don't know.  That would, wow.  I could see myself wanting to do that.  Really?  Oh, without a doubt.  All right.  Anthony's spilling of the beans continues.  He did this on Rana Fez on Friday.  And then some of my stuff disappeared.  And at this point, I have money in my pocket.  I am to pick up dry cleaning and a camera and drop that off.  And then I could get back the rest of the stuff I have.  I've been paying cash for my tolls because my E-ZPass is gone. 
[01:23:00]  Uh, there's a laptop computer that, uh, seems to be missing.  And for a while, uh, she was in possession of my pistol license, uh, which I needed to  go and, cause I had just bought one and I needed to take down to the police department  to, to get it registered.  And if I didn't have it, I probably would have been up on federal firearms charges at  some point, but, uh, so I got that back.  Oh, it got a little wacky there, Ronnie. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Uh, she didn't, you know, obviously didn't futz around with the, uh, the, uh, any of  my firearms, which is good, but it's a little piece of paper that entitles me the right to,  um, you know, possess said firearms.  Well, what happens if you took that, what happens if you don't have that for, for real?  Like, well, I can just say that someone took it or it's on file.  I would have gone down to the police station and said, you know, I need another license.  It's, uh, it, uh, got lost or stolen or something.  In a fire pit.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  In a fire pit.  But, uh, the thing is I had like two days left to take one of my brand new guns down to  the precinct with my license to register it.  So I wasn't able to do that without the license.  So how'd you get the license back?  I just texted and said, look, you know, I need that.  I need that.  I really need that.  All right.  I'll give you that, but not the rest of the stuff.  Yeah.  Wow.  So it was kind of a, you know, you know how the, you know how a hijackers let out a couple 
[01:24:30]  of hot women and children and the sickly out of the plane.  That's pretty much what that was, but it's like, Oh no, we're keeping some of the strong  men in here.  Wow.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is really, really interesting.  So there's still a couple of things that are up for grabs.  Uh, and then there was a big discussion, um, uh, as to, uh, on Ron and Fez show, uh, as  to whether I should go over there and face to face, give her either the clothes, the money 
[01:25:00]  for the dry cleaning, the camera, or the money for the camera and get my stuff and have this  psycho babble word called closure.  Um, which I don't see the point in, I think at a breakup, there's a point where you have  to be face to face and you know, believe me, we were face to face to face, uh, in that  situation.  But as far as a hostage exchange with, uh, clothes or anything like that, even my last 
[01:25:30]  text with, uh, uh, uh, Melinda, you know, I wasn't home when she came to pick stuff up.  I'm like, you want to pick some stuff up?  Keith will be there, go down in the basement, make sure it's your crap and take it.  Godspeed.  But I don't want to be there.  The breakup's done.  There's no more business to, uh, tend to.  So it's, uh, you know, it's an exchange.  I don't want to be there.  I am so with Anthony on that.  I envy that.  Oof.  I, I'm, I don't want to. 
[01:26:00]  When I, when I got, when I got my stuff out of Huntington, that's exactly how it went down.  I was like, I don't want you to be there.  I had Jay was in town.  I'm like, Jay, I will, we'll come and get my stuff.  Don't be there.  I, I, there's no reason for you to be there.  I'm done.  Hey, uh, we got to go to Pat in Philly.  Uh, Pat.  Anthony, I just got a quick comment.  I mean, you're so paranoid about home invasions, but you allow somebody with keys just to come  in and just, well, that's different than a home invasion.  That's different from a home invasion. 
[01:26:30]  I, I, I didn't expect her to come in, tie me up with a phone cord pistol with me, but  you still have that paranoia of somebody coming in and taking things from your home.  And no, it's not so much taking things from my home.  It's bodily harm.  I don't care if somebody like, like if somebody burglarized my house when no one was there,  I'd be pissed, but insurance takes care of stuff like that.  Uh, you'd feel violated, everything, you know, but, uh, it's people coming in when you're  there and, and beating you senseless.  That's my, my fear. 
[01:27:00]  That's my home invasion fear.  It's not a, it's not a burglary fear.  But if she would have got in, look at the, the, I mean, she could have got so many guns  to get you.  You know what I mean?  Eh, she wasn't that good a shot.  Whoa.  I'll just dodge him.  There you go.  Uh, yeah, this is how it went down on Rana Fez.  Are you going to have someone ride shotgun for you?  Are you going to have somebody up on the roof keeping an eye on things?  Yeah, I think, I think we're at that point.  I'm going to do something that is completely, uh, uh, just wussing out. 
[01:27:30]  Uh, I don't think I'm going to pick up the dry cleaning.  I think I'm going to just give Keith cash, have him either do it or just drop her off the  cash and pick my up.  Cause I don't want to go.  Why am I going over there?  Why am I going over there to talk?  To f***ing, oh, how have you been?  You need closure.  The thing, it's not a movie.  I don't have to go over there and get closure.  Yeah.  And we see each other, oh, how have you been?  Yeah.  Well, I've been fine.  How have you been?  I have your stuff.  I see. 
[01:28:00]  I have your things.  Let me go get them.  You know, I, I apologize for how I've been.  F***.  Days of our lives.  F***.  Well, that ain't me.  Yeah.  That's all I picture.  Cause that's the only thing you're going to get out of that situation.  The breakup.  Yes.  Do it face to face.  No matter how it comes about, you have to be face to face.  As far as that goes, I've heard people emailed their breakups and stuff like that.  And that's kind of, you know, but, um, you know, what, what would that be? 
[01:28:30]  I picture the scenario, go over there, the, the, you know, I got the clothes, uh, knock  on the door.  Oh, there it is.  Now you're seeing each other again.  Well, it's the first time in, uh, well over a month.  Well, what's that small talk chat chat like?  I'm with you.  It's, it's something, it's a situation.  I don't want to put myself in.  I don't want to be in there.  I don't want to see.  I don't want to know.  I don't want to talk.  I'm with you.  There's no point to it.  No.  Intermediary will make the exchange.  Sure. 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  And they get paid well anyway, so they might as well.  Right.  Tough stuff for you.  That's it.  Um, we got more clips from Anthony's time on the Ron and Fez show.  Some just great radio that went down on Friday and we got some highlights.  Uh, but first we got, uh, we got to go back to this NBC thing with Sam.  Oh, we're doing less commercials today because, uh, check this out.  It's NBC premiere week.  I know that much.  Yeah.  Uh, they want to fly out the show to LA to talk to, uh, the lesser known 
[01:29:30]  stars of some very big NBC shows.  And we said, nah, we'll, we'll, we'll send one of the lesser known members of the  Open Anthony show to interview the lesser known people of some of these big shows.  It just makes sense that way.  And then he'll come back, Sam, and we'll goof on how awful his interviews are.  Not because of your interviewing style, my friend, but just that it's a disaster  waiting to happen.  Nothing good could come out of the situation you were in.  I disagree.  I think that these were a lot of stars.  Uh, sorry.  What's wrong?  I'm just laughing at Jimmy. 
[01:30:00]  Jimmy, he's got a disgusted look as he looks at his strawberry and man seed, uh, salad.  What's wrong?  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what it is.  Kenny.  What's Kenny?  What's up?  Can you have an explanation for what to sitting in front of Jimmy?  They kind of mixed up the fruit and the yogurt today.  Oh boy.  That's going to, Jimmy's going to throw that away.  You want, you want me to get it separate?  No.  I just didn't know what it was.  That's all.  I'm not making me kill it.  I just saw it.  All right.  I just think it looks like something that starts with a boo. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  It doesn't look like that.  It should be on your glasses or something smeared.  So, uh, Sam?  Yes.  What do we get to listen to this break?  Well, I thought that, uh, the audience might want to hear from Bob Harper from The Biggest Loser.  Who?  Bob Harper, I could tell you.  He's the host of The Biggest Loser.  Bob Harper.  He actually, uh, cool.  I can't.  I'm sure he's funny.  Let's hear this interview.  I'm sure it's terrific.  Well, he, uh, I watched The Biggest Loser. 
[01:31:00]  Opie, I might have mentioned someone's name.  I got it.  Oh!  I got to be honest.  I watched The Biggest Loser.  I knew that.  I'm a loser for watching The Biggest Loser.  I know that.  But I do watch.  I get involved in these, these fatties' lives.  These, I can't put down a snack for the life of me.  I have to go to a fat farm and have Bob Harper, you know, work the pounds off me for, for, uh, three or four months.  And then I go back into the real world and I get fat again.  That's the problem with the show, my friend. 
[01:31:30]  There's no follow-up?  Are we being honest here today?  Let's be honest.  I love Biggest Loser, but I want, I want the follow-ups because I know all these people, for the most part, go back into the real world and get fat again.  Yeah.  Why don't they ever bring the old people back to see how they're doing?  No, why?  Why?  Because they're back with their lousy jobs, you know, having to eat like the rest of us on the go.  Right.  And they get fat again.  Well, they're doing it.  That's why the show, in the end, doesn't work.  They're doing families this season, so maybe the different family members will be able to, you know, keep each other on track.  I don't know.  I'm going to watch to find out. 
[01:32:00]  Well, of course, are we all?  Yeah.  I actually pitched a weight loss show like that, and they're like, they don't want to do it.  It's so annoying.  What's it called?  Here, piggy, piggy.  There's a major flaw with this show, though, I'm telling you.  They hide the people after they're done with the show because they know that they're just going to get fat because it's impossible in this day and age to, like, really keep the weight off.  All right.  Well, we get to hear Sam interview the host, Bob Harper.  He does a good job on The Biggest Loser. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We're here with Bob from The Biggest Loser at the NBC premiere party.  Bob, what's the haps?  How's it going, man?  I like your hair, by the way.  Thank you very much.  It's cool.  I'm participating in an Afro contest that ended six months ago.  You won.  Yeah.  I did win.  You did win.  But I have trouble letting go of bits.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So you're on The Biggest Loser.  I am.  Something that you might take as a compliment, Opie from The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  You know, the guy that didn't feel like it was important enough to be here in L.A., so I'm here. 
[01:33:00]  Yes.  That's what you're doing.  You might take as a compliment, Opie from The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Loves The Biggest Loser.  Yeah.  He watches it every week religiously.  I got to tell you, it really has kind of inspired a whole nation to watch.  It's not just like overweight people.  It's just everybody watching it now.  Sam, I appreciate what you're trying to do there, but Bob Harper has no effing idea who I am.  But I do appreciate that you tried, hoping to go, really?  I listen to those guys all the time.  Yeah, he was like, yeah? 
[01:33:30]  Like, oh, really?  Well, I guess it is.  I mean, the whole nation is inspired.  But I do know Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, I know Jim.  Yeah.  He's hysterical.  I love it.  That was funny.  When Michael, yeah, from The Wire, when he was like, oh, my God, that was you on Unlucky  Louis.  He hugged me.  I was so upset that another celebrity knew you.  I don't know why it upsets me.  I should be happy for you.  They all do. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  They all do.  And they're in the studio.  Hey, Jimmy Norton!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Let me look up at your knees.  Look right in his shin.  I'm right enough.  Another week.  Come on, guys.  Let it go.  Come on.  Stop trying to have fun.  Stop trying to worry the audience.  Be miserable like me.  Make it right!  So, Sam, that was the start of this terrific interview with Bob Harper from The Biggest Loser. 
[01:34:30]  So far, we learned he doesn't give a crap about Opie and Anthony.  He has no clue who we are.  No, we learned.  And thinks everyone loves his show.  Well, that's the reason why we weren't going out to L.A.  We weren't going to be humiliated in front of these almost stars.  There were a lot of people who were staring at the Opie and Anthony sign, and then they got a little glimmer in their eyes, and then they looked into the tent where I was sitting.  Oh.  And then they kept on walking.  Oh.  They just kept on walking.  Just assuming there were two engineers in the tent, not...  Yeah.  Maybe they thought we were in the restroom. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Or something.  I guess I'll keep looking.  Well, Sam continues his terrific interview with the host of The Biggest Loser.  Yeah.  We have a producer for our show.  His name is E-Rock, but his nickname is Hoagie Boy.  Every time...  So he likes sandwiches, I guess.  Yeah.  I mean, they call him Hoagie Boy.  I guess that's part of the problem.  Well, that's why.  He always...  We had to take him off the mixing board, you know?  Yeah.  Because his fingers were so greasy from all the mayonnaise.  Every time he loses weight, he gains it right back.  Isn't that sad? 
[01:35:30]  I see people do this all the time.  I've seen guys that have lost 200 pounds that gain it all back.  It just...  It's perplexing to me.  And you'd think...  And know what he means by I've seen guys?  The people that used to be on the show.  See?  He's even admitting it.  And he wants to go, look, I'm not supposed to tell you, but this crap's not working.  But I'm getting a pretty damn good paycheck from NBC.  That's who he's talking about in this clip.  Gain it all back.  It's perplexing to me.  And you'd think when people start calling him Hoagie Boy, he would be like, I gotta lose 
[01:36:00]  this weight.  It's turned into a term of endearment for him.  He's really comfortable with what he's doing.  I guess so.  Do you have any advice that you could give him?  Yeah.  Tell Hoagie Boy to put the hoagie down.  But you're an expert.  You gotta be a little more complicated.  Just put it down.  That's all.  Stop doing it.  But you're the expert.  Well, I mean, they use computers and stuff on the show.  Like, you can't just tell someone to put it down.  It's a little more complicated than that, Sam.  He has helped a lot of people on the show. 
[01:36:30]  And then they gain it back.  And we don't know that for a fact.  I would bet 90% of the people gain most of their weight back after they leave the show.  I'm not even trying to be funny.  I'm telling you, that's probably what's going on.  Because you don't see any of these people walking about after the show's over.  But it is amazing to see the journey they take.  Is it?  He doesn't eat desserts.  He doesn't eat chocolates.  He's always got two hoagies.  One in each hand.  Then I tell him, okay, if he's going to have the hoagies, he's going to have to cut the mayonnaise  out and cut the cheese. 
[01:37:00]  Excuse the pun.  That's going to help hoagie boy.  What's the most healthy hoagie you could eat?  I guess it would have to be those low-sodium, lean hams.  They have chicken breasts now that are sliced as opposed to staying away from the pastrami  and all those really high-fatty meats.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, great.  And the Biggest Loser premieres this week?  It premiered last night.  Last night?  Well, that shows how much I know.  Yeah, that's okay.  You're too busy growing your hair.  Screwed that one up.  You're too busy growing your hair. 
[01:37:30]  I see.  I was just sitting there growing my hair and didn't realize it because you're losing your  arm.  This guy has a sense of humor.  God love him.  Oh, yeah.  Got some great advice from Bob Harper.  The banality of these interviews is mind-boggling.  It is useless information.  No, because the information we're getting is NBC premiere week.  Well, yes.  And all the great shows we can have.  But you understand that.  But talking to the people is not compelling.  Yeah.  There's nothing thought-provoking.  There's no answers to any pressing questions. 
[01:38:00]  This is like you've walked in the middle of an incredibly boring conversation between two  people at a party and you would walk away from it in a second.  Yeah.  Well, what I think is the people at home can judge for themselves.  These are just the best of clips.  You're going to be able to hear the entire celebrity interviews, all 12 or however many  of them I did.  Anyway, we're going to have another interview from Sam in about a half hour or so. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, thank goodness.  It's so hard to keep a straight face.  Oh, dumb broad.  See, I'd rather watch The Biggest Loser on NBC than hear interviews with the host.  True.  What's the last show we're going to highlight today there, Sam?  My Own Worst Enemy, which stars Christian Slater.  Oh, okay.  That's The Big Get.  Yeah.  Save it for last.  That's what I'm saying.  Is it a new show?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, I don't know anything about that one.  Maybe we'll finally learn something.  Of course, it's Christian Slater's first foray into a television series, starring in a television 
[01:39:00]  series.  And it seems like a very exciting premise.  What is the premise?  Well, he's a normal guy, but he's got a chip in his head that turns him into a government  spy on the weekends.  Potato?  No, not a potato chip.  It's like electronic chip.  Yeah.  You got to clear those things up.  No, you're right.  Can I ask Sam to repeat that?  Because I thought I heard something I couldn't have heard.  Oh, okay.  Well, it's like a normal guy during the week with a family and everything, white picket fences, 
[01:39:30]  and then he's got a chip in his brain that on the weekends he turns into like a government  spy.  Oh, okay.  Why wouldn't he do it on a Monday?  Again, it's not something he's in control of.  Or who's in control?  Who knows?  I mean, I guess the government...  Oh, therein lies the secret.  Well, it's Henry and Edward.  It's two different personalities.  Oh, so...  By Christian Slater.  Mm-hmm.  Cool.  They should have called it the Manchurian Candidate.  Yeah.  Maybe that...  Oh, God. 
[01:40:00]  Damn.  Oh, wow.  Sam.  Well, that was a good movie, and this is going to be a good show.  I can't wait.  How much money did we pay for this trip to L.A.?  I didn't get any.  Oh, you got a free trip to L.A.  That's right.  What hotel they put you up?  The Renaissance.  It was really nice.  It was right by the Kodak Theater there.  Oh, that's cool.  Kodak Theater.  They flew them coach.  That's a...  They should.  Look at them.  Since it was just him, they should have flown them first.  They should have forced them to hand out soft drinks. 
[01:40:30]  It was a good flight.  Very smooth.  Look at the flyaways that are happening in this hair now.  It went from a point where it was a very nice, roundish afro.  Then it had these curly cues that kind of stuck out from the roundness.  But now, these single, almost straight hairs are flying out.  Yeah.  It doesn't even get combed anymore.  It doesn't even get combed anymore.  It's like a matted sheep at a feeding, one of those petting zoos.  That's what your hair is getting like. 
[01:41:00]  That's wonderful.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Today's show brought to you with limited commercials thanks to NBC and NBC Premiere Week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're starting a new segment.  Yeah.  It's called The Dumbest Man in the Country.  All right.  And I want to congratulate our first winner, young Eric Nagel from Florida.  Eric Nagel.  Eric Nagel, everyone.  Also known as Hoagie Boy, Eswab, Efat. 
[01:41:30]  So, Eric, you want to...  What did he do, Jimmy?  Eric, could you please do your best here?  Okay.  Try to convey the story you just told us in the exact fashion with the same amount of  enthusiasm.  Vigor and gusto that you did the first time.  Okay.  During the break, there was a discussion about how people in the 1800s couldn't understand  things that happen now, like a plane flying over, the particle machine and everything.  So...  Particle machine?  Particle machine?  Whatever. 
[01:42:00]  The collider.  Okay.  So, I said, oh, a few months ago they had posted photos online about this tribe in Brazil  that no one's ever heard of.  They've had no contact with.  But a plane was flying over, taking photos, and you see the tribesmen throwing spears and  stuff at the plane, because they didn't know what it was.  And apparently, I had no idea that the whole thing was fake.  Oh, did you see that jerk? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, did you see that jerk?  It's fake, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too much time with Steve.  Why are you blaming it on Steve?  Exactly.  It's rubbing off, seeing anything on the internet and just believing that it's real.  He is a boob.  No one's denying that.  All right, Iraq.  Thanks.  You're welcome.  Yeah, Iraq.  It was wonderful. 
[01:43:00]  Going back to Anthony's spilling of the details of his Anthelini breakup.  The demise.  He finally really got into it on the Rana Fez show on Friday, and it was just great radio  to listen to.  But we figured this side of the show needs some closure, even though you don't need closure  in your relationship.  Not for myself.  Well, for the listeners.  As far as a radio bit goes, these listeners, they need closure.  Listeners always need a little closure. 
[01:43:30]  So we're...  Closure.  We're playing some of the highlights of Anthony's time on the Rana Fez show on Friday, which really  was very good.  So we continue now.  A lot of fun with those guys, yeah.  We'll go with clip seven there.  All right.  Anthony just discussing the breakup and relationships in general and everything.  Sure.  Let's go over here to...  Here's Rob.  Rob wants to get some advice for you.  Go ahead, Rob.  I just wanted to say about Anthony, now that I've heard the fall of Nicolini, I always 
[01:44:00]  thought you to be the sensible guy, the guy to stick it out and maybe end it with a little  diplomacy as diplomatic as you went into it.  And Opie's the guy who throws a can at a wind and does it the wrong way.  You guys have flip-flopped.  No, that's actually the complete opposite of what really happens in real life.  I know, and I'm not going to speak for Opie and everything, but I know from knowing him  for so long, he's kind of the guy that, you know, will be more diplomatic with a relationship, 
[01:44:30]  especially with ending it.  He'll talk to the people and things like that.  And he's kind of sensitive and he likes to go over the annoying things.  Right, right, right.  You know what, like, every time you guys get fired, it's more of a personal thing to him  than it is to you.  Yeah, I'm like, ah, you know.  Yeah, he's like Sonny Corleone.  Right.  You know, he's personal, he's personal.  And I'm trying to be, you know, more like the consigliere and not really, you know, don't  take it personally.  Sonny!  It's also hard to care when you're drunk. 
[01:45:00]  So that's why.  It really is.  That's why I try to stay drunk.  Sonny!  Sonny!  Ronny's a genius.  Ah, there we go, yeah.  God, I love Ron Bennington.  No, Ant and I are similar in that regard.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah, I think we've put out enough info now that when we were on top of our game at  N.E.W., Ant and I were both absolutely miserable in our personal lives.  Oh, God.  We had the world by the balls.  Oh, and it just...  And we were both horrendous.  And other people had ours in their hands. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  I just remember, like, when we used to, like, commute back to Huntington, and either you  or I would go, ah, you want to take a few circles around the block before we have to  go home.  It's going down on Main Street a little bit.  Might as well just go around.  And it wasn't even anything great to see.  No.  That's how pathetic it was.  Because I would pull up in front of Anthony's house if I was driving that day, like, ah,  you want to do a spin around the neighborhood, see what's going on.  And obviously nothing was going on, but it was better than, like, going into the house  at that given moment. 
[01:46:00]  Oh.  And then Ant would do the same thing.  I would just be like, okay, now I can get home and new level in Half-Life.  I'll just play it.  I got to get through that game.  And then I walk in, and I'd already been yelled at for going right to the computer when I get  in the house.  So I'd have to do this faux, I'm interested in sitting down and talking to you thing.  And as she's talking, all I'm hearing is, is wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  And I'm thinking, all right, I got to get on top of the electrical generator.  I got to pull two levers, get down, get past the water that's electrified. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  Head crabs.  Jeez, I hate head crabs.  Then the zombie things.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I just wanted to play the game.  And then I'd be like, yeah, I think I'm going to go over on the computer for a little while.  She'd sigh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I know Ant's told the story a lot, but can you even.  Candle day?  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:00]  Because I remember, I pull up to Anthony's house, and all of a sudden I know where he goes,  oh, great.  I'm like, what?  He goes to see all those candles lit.  They were lit all over the house.  Dude, by that point in the relationship, the last thing I wanted was any kind of intimacy.  Right.  I just didn't want it.  There were no lights on in the house.  No.  There were just candles on.  Shooter was good for that, too.  Done.  That's all.  Well, I wanted no intimacy.  And I go, Ant, what's up with the candles?  And then.  Yeah, we'd pull up to the house. 
[01:47:30]  There's candles all over the place.  That was romance night.  Wow.  The candles are all lit.  When you have to schedule a romance night, the relationship is over.  I'm finished.  I'm serious.  And I don't want to hear from the married couples out there, with the kids and stuff,  we got a pet sale and it's Tuesday.  There were no kids, by the way.  If you can't figure out how to get it done in between all the craziness that's going on,  then I think your relationship is done.  I think there's a problem there.  I just didn't want anything to do with her at that point.  It was, you know, it was pretty much nothing. 
[01:48:00]  Nothing left.  And the candles would be lit.  And I'm like, oh, Christ.  Now I got to dig deep into my J.O. Rolodex while I just.  Pretend it's anyone else.  Yeah.  While I just move like an oil derrick until it's over.  Ch-kung, ch-kung, ch-kung.  And is there anything worse than when you're in the Rolodex and they say something?  You're like, stop talking.  You're out of my mind right now.  Shut up.  You don't sound like her. 
[01:48:30]  Exactly.  You don't sound like them.  You don't sound like him.  Could you bark?  Don't ask questions.  You get the peanut butter.  Let's make this interesting.  That I feel bad for you.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it was just awful.  And the candles were lit.  And I'm like, oh.  So she'd be at the door waiting with a tall tumbler glass of Captain Moore.  Chugging in Coke.  That helped.  She knew what she was dealing with.  Yeah, chugged that down pretty quick. 
[01:49:00]  And you're hogging it like Mr. Snuffleupagus.  Drink it that way.  Let's splash it over my back if I'm hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So moving on.  We're just about done with some of the highlights from Anthony's time on the Rona Fez show.  Noon to 3 on XM Sirius Radio.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM, whatever you want to be called these days until they change the name to something that makes sense.  So now I guess the last thing to discuss is when you're going to go over there and get your stuff. 
[01:49:30]  Get my goods.  Hopefully we have an update on that because this is from Friday.  But this is how it went down on Rona Fez.  Could you imagine I walk in.  She goes, how you doing?  And takes a frying pan and smacks herself in the head with it.  And goes, I've already called 911.  I'd be like, holy ****, I'm ****.  Now I have to, you know, kill you.  Ronnie.  I don't know what you want to say about that, but that little tidbit is based on a real story. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  That was my brother's episode.  All right.  I wasn't sure if you wanted to go there or not because when I heard you say that on Rona Fez, I'm like, wow, this is a real story that happened to Ant's brother.  Yeah, my brother's just a mellow guy, wouldn't lay his hands on anybody, never a girl, girlfriend, anything like that, no matter what.  Joe's a walk away from the situation guy.  He'll say, F you.  He'll go, you know, all right, you know something, enough. 
[01:50:30]  And he'll just leave the premises.  He'll drive to a friend's house or something.  Well, during the time they were getting a divorce, his soon-to-be ex-wife, he was over the house.  He was doing laundry.  I guess they were still living in the same house while they were going through this proceeding, which is probably the worst thing you could do.  And they were in a little tiff, and supposedly she had grabbed this frying pan and just smashed herself in the mouth with it and called the cops. 
[01:51:00]  And was like, yeah, he punched me in the mouth.  And the law is you go to jail.  So they cuffed him, took him to jail, and he's got a pistol license, too.  So they took all of his guns, took that away.  He finally got it back.  But he had some thing where he worked this outward.  He had a neighbor who his ex-wife was confiding in, and he approached the neighbor and said, would you wear a recording device? 
[01:51:30]  Are you kidding?  Yeah, that's how that worked out.  And they said yes, wore the recording device.  She got the ex-wife to fess up to the fact that, yeah, she did smash herself and got him put in jail.  And then Joe went to court with that and was like, I'm going to file charges against you.  Did he file them against you?  No, it wound up getting, he dropped it for a little trade of divorce stuff.  So, yeah, it, uh, I always wondered how that worked out.  I never, I never heard the end of that story. 
[01:52:00]  There was a wire involved.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  You're going to wear a wire.  Can you imagine all that happening to you?  Oh, what would you, I would lose my effing mind.  I'd hit her for real.  Yeah, then you could clock her for real because you're going to jail anyway.  That's what you say, like, look, I'm going to jail anyway, so all right, here's my real shot.  Punch you right in the mouth.  Unbelievable.  Uh, yeah, that was something.  All right, we're almost done with some of the highlights from, uh, your time on Ron and Fez here.  We go back to the tape.  Uh, I was wondering, uh, when she, uh, took your Escalade, uh, did she make copies of your keys? 
[01:52:30]  Did you have to change your locks?  Um, that's a good question, but I did change my, my locks.  I didn't want to, you know.  After the, uh, fire.  Yeah, you gotta, you gotta change, uh, you gotta change the locks.  You don't know if anyone's making a key.  Well, yeah.  Oh, I was worried about that one.  Oh, boy.  Yeesh.  Don't need any of those missing.  Yeah, you know, those have to be kept secured.  Mm-hmm.  All right, we'll go.  Went to the range this weekend.  Huh.  And, well, Danny's pretty good with the, uh, AR-15. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, Danny's, you're getting to fire the gun?  Put Danny down to the range.  Some of those guns are absolutely ridiculous.  Yeah.  Especially the, the scope on, on, uh, Ant's AR-15.  Yeah, it's an ACOG.  It's like, it's basically like, just like cheating in a video game.  It's like, you put the code in, and then you could just, you could just shoot bullets through  the same hole over and over again.  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  He had a ridiculous grouping, Danny.  First time shooting that rifle, uh, with a, it's an ACOG scope.  And it's funny, on the way home, he pulled a Master Poe without knowing it. 
[01:53:30]  He goes, that scope's gotta go for what?  Like, 800 bucks?  Like, dude, it's about three times what the rifle cost.  Wow.  But it's what all the Marines use.  Uh, it's, it's...  I don't get it, I don't get the dialing in a code.  I'm such a...  It's, oh, like, like, if you put in a, uh, a cheat code on a video game.  Right.  That's what it's like when you're shooting through this scope.  But you still gotta fire the gun.  You can't miss.  But how do you not miss with the cheat code?  You're so...  Because it's not a video game.  I don't, I don't get it.  The scope is so accurate, uh, that it's very hard to... 
[01:54:00]  You put the crosshairs...  Okay.  The bullet's going where the crosshairs go.  It's just such a great optic.  It's, it's built so well.  How does it do that?  Because the crosshairs are above the, the actual chamber.  How do they fix that out?  Thank you, Jimmy.  I'm with you.  How do they work, like, how do guns work that out?  Well, if you line some up with the crosshair, you're, you're like an inch or so above the  barrel of the gun.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How does it, how does it, like, why aren't you shooting below it?  It works out with the distance.  And when are you gonna take...  You know?  When are you gonna take... 
[01:54:30]  And the elevation, you adjust for elevation.  Oh.  So I'm sure that's taken into consideration.  When are you gonna take Jimmy and I shooting?  You go to the range, let's, let's go.  I know, I've never shot a gun.  Next weekend.  Maybe a BB gun.  You wanna go next weekend, we'll go to the range.  I'd love to.  Oh, yeah.  I've never shot a gun.  Jimmy, you wanna go...  It's a boy, it's a lot of fun.  I'm away, but I would.  I've shot many years ago, I shot rifles.  Yeah.  What, like 22s, though?  Yeah, a little, into windows.  You gotta shoot something that you know you're shooting a gun.  This is like, kablam!  I mean, you know, there's outdoor ranges, but the one that we had went to over the weekend 
[01:55:00]  was an indoor range.  Yeah.  Just firing very loud weapons indoors.  Yeah.  There's something very, very cool about that.  Did you guys shoot side by side, then have the two things come towards you?  Like, ah, nice shot, Terk!  Danny actually said that in the reference.  He goes, yeah, rooster!  Yeah, Terk!  Good shooting!  Good shooting!  We're bringing the target back.  Yeah!  Nice shot, but don't be cocky, rooster!  Is Dan a good shot? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, he actually is.  He's a really good shot.  I mean, obviously, he's got more time.  Sure, wow.  More time in the range than I'd have.  Yeah, right on.  It's fun with the...  Like, I enjoy shooting the rifles a lot, but the pistols are a lot of fun, too.  And you get that target way back there, and you realize how hard, how much harder it  is with a pistol than it is with a rifle, obviously.  Are you allowed to bring pictures that you want to shoot?  And, yeah, this one guy that was there had a target and everything.  I'm not even joking.  Like, can you bring pictures of the people you hate?  Yeah, you can bring any...  As long as it's a paper target, you know, you can hang it up on the hanger and put it 
[01:56:00]  out there.  It's fine, yeah.  Whatever you want.  Can you bring a picture of someone?  Yeah.  He said, yeah.  So, can we make videos of this?  I think they technically frown on videos being taken in there, but I took a little small  video camera and place it up there.  We'll bring some hidden cameras to your shooting room.  Hidden cameras.  All right, listen.  We've got to finish up with this, because then we've got another terrific interview that  Sam did out there in L.A.  Ooh.  To finish up today's show.  Anthony explaining why he dates women a lot younger than him. 
[01:56:30]  I did?  This is from Friday's show.  Can I guess as to why, even though I didn't hear this?  Because they're better.  That's my guess.  Because he can.  But you see, Ant laughs, we're all laughing.  It's a good thing.  Yeah, it's what it is.  It's a positive.  That's what it is.  Well, you're having adventures.  I know that.  Adventures, yeah.  You've got to have adventures in life.  And by the way, I just don't get along with women my own age. 
[01:57:00]  I just don't.  There's a woman.  I don't even want to.  I don't know what the hell she's talking about.  It's like groceries and kids and holidays.  I want like Disneyland and candy.  Homework.  You want a girl who's going like this.  Oh, this is so good.  You can't even taste the alcohol.  It's so good.  You want to be there for her first drink.  I like, yes, you should be there for their first drink.  And it should be a Zima. 
[01:57:30]  They should love it.  Mmm.  Wow.  I really don't get along with like girls, women my own age.  I get along with guys my own age.  That's cool.  Hang out for the most part.  You know, but women my own age, they go through this phase where nothing's very fun anymore.  They're not into having fun.  Like fun is this scheduled thing that's got to be around everything they're doing.  It's just, and then the stuff they want to talk about isn't fun or interesting or spontaneous or anything. 
[01:58:00]  You know, a bunch of old frigging fuddy duddies.  Enough.  Do the wash and shut up.  When I was single, my sister set me up with a girl of my own age, Crab Meadow Golf Course.  It was a golf day because there's broad like golfs.  Of course she does.  I'm like, I have nothing to do.  All right, I'll go on this, you know.  And I saw her walking up.  I'm like, I picked up my cell phone.  I called my sister.  I go, I am going to kill you. 
[01:58:30]  I couldn't relate whatsoever.  And this girl was probably, might have even been a couple years younger than me.  She was so old looking in my eyes.  I was like, you've got to be effing kidding me.  But I was a nice guy.  I should have just said, look, I'm breaking out in hives and I should have ran.  But just like Ann, I'm a nice guy.  I'm like, all right, let's play some golf.  And we're walking playing golf and the whole time she's hoping I'm going to ask her out on a date.  And I'm like, there's no effing way.  And then I had to walk her to the car and there was the awkward, you know, are we going to exchange numbers thing. 
[01:59:00]  And I kind of said something like, well, I'll see you around.  Because my sister was working at some bar at a country club.  I'm like, ah, maybe I'll see you back at that place.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm sure sometime we'll have a drink.  I never saw her again.  I had nothing relatable with this one.  Can I say there's in the office, the new one, like not the new one, the Ricky Gervais one, but the two-hour special.  There's a scene where he's going on blind dates and he's putting an ad in. 
[01:59:30]  You got to see the two-hour special.  And there's one that shows up at this restaurant.  Because he's famous.  He's David Brent and he's done this show.  So they're like filming as a documentary, like what happened to the office people after.  Yeah.  And she's like not obese, but she's just kind of a fat, like chubby girl.  Like she's a bloch.  Big girl.  She's a female E-Rock.  Oh.  Exactly.  Yes.  Oh.  Yes.  And his, when she goes, David, and his like, his hesitation in answering her and obviously 
[02:00:00]  wanting to get out of being, is so great.  The story sucked.  I really did just stop the show with a brick wall.  But trust me, it's so perfect.  We should bring in the audio.  I would like to, okay.  Because I'd like to see that.  Yeah, it's his facial expressions.  Yeah, yeah.  Where he kind of does that curl his nose up thing.  Yeah.  Hey, one more clip from the Ron and Fez show on Friday when Anthony was spilling his guts. 
[02:00:30]  One time the police showed up.  Yeah.  A little set up here.  Sorry.  Ooh, they, uh...  Basically, Anthony, you know, now that he's been single for a little while, with a little  relationship in between, he, uh, he's having a lot of house parties and, and, uh, enjoying  the hell out of his life.  And, uh, he's telling a story of, uh, what happened at one of these house parties.  That's not a good story.  That's what happened.  That can't be good.  That happens when I'm over.  That can't be good. 
[02:01:00]  One time the, uh, police showed up.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  The, uh, ooh, they, uh, they didn't knock right away.  It was four cars, four Nassau County cars, and six officers.  Uh, they were called by the c**t that lives on an angle behind me.  Nice lady, I said, by the way.  They called up very stealthily and quietly and walked up to my back gate and were looking  over the gate for a while before they, uh, let their presence be known.  Uh, and they, they saw, uh, perhaps some nudity, um, perhaps some, uh, pfft, pfft, pfft, 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  You know, they just saw some things.  Um, and then they were like, they came in, they're like, Anthony.  Uh, and the music was blasting.  Right.  Uh, so the first officer, the first thing he said was, Anthony, uh, it's f***ing Wednesday.  Throw my hands up, what are you gonna do?  And then they all just started talking about the merger and they go, you know, we were  watching you for a little while back there.  He goes, enough said.  Like, oh, okay.  And then the delivery came, a pizza guy came and, uh, I go, I gotta get the door. 
[02:02:00]  And now the cops are talking amongst themselves.  So I go to the door and the pizza guy now sees four cars, uh, cop cars in front of my  house.  He's like, what's going on here?  I just give him the money.  I go, nothing.  Get out of here.  You didn't see a thing.  I didn't see nothing.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Man, the super bad cops are showing up.  Oh, yeah.  They were very cool.  They were very nice.  Uh, you know, they, they just said, keep the music down because the woman there, and they  actually called her a c*** too.  They said, she's really, she just bitches about everything.  This place has sounded more and more like the Tate LaBianca. 
[02:02:30]  C***.  You can only hope for an ending like that too.  It just seems like the way we're heading here.  Uh, Tate LaBianca.  We got up, we tried to press the key, there was blood on it, we got in, first thing we  saw was piggies on the wall.  F and Ronnie, very good.  Hey, we got to take a break, but the one thing that needs to be said that you did say on Ron  and Fez, I wish we had that clip, not that you have to explain yourself, but people are 
[02:03:00]  like, wow, Anthony's out of control.  Wow, Anthony's this.  But the, but what people need to know is, and you explained this on Ron and Fez, you, you  were in two relationships that were pretty much 15, 17 years, 15 plus years.  If you count three relationships, three relationships, the past three relationships I've had were eight  years for the last one.  The marriage was nine years and the relationship before that was six years.  So you're talking 23 years, three girls, 21 years and, and a good, and a good boy. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  And a good boy in those 21 years.  I mean, Christ.  Six years.  And that's six.  Eight.  Six, nine, and eight.  I can't get past the year and a half.  Lucky, lucky you.  What happens to me?  I don't know, sense.  Dude, the wheels, the wheels start to wobble after three months. 
[02:04:00]  They wobble?  After six months, the power steering is gone.  After a year, it's like the two of the tires are missing.  It's like those things in cops where you know the guy's just going for broke.  How do you do that?  And at that point, you just hope the car doesn't break down on a road trip.  I just, I just.  You just hope it breaks down on the way to the supermarket or something easy.  So, you know, the point being, then Anthony gets involved with Jill.  It looked really good on the surface to everyone involved.  Yeah.  But, uh, I'm just, uh, uh, expressing what, uh, uh, relaying what I heard on Ron and Fez. 
[02:04:30]  And then you felt like you were going right into the same crap you've done for the last  20 some odd years.  Like, here I go.  I'm right back in it again.  What the hell am I doing?  And, uh, that's, you know, I, I, I couldn't have that.  So instead of being honest and forthright, I decided to go the other route with my route.  And safe to say you're having a great time and you, and this is what you want for yourself. 
[02:05:00]  So, and you know what?  It should be said.  We all liked Jill.  It should be said.  We really did like Jill and all.  And did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, she was great to all of us.  It's bad.  You know, it wasn't, it was bad time for Rand and, uh, you know, he needs to, you know,  do what he's doing now.  And that's, that's fine.  That's Ann's life.  But I, I don't want to make it sound like we're just like beating up on her.  Cause, uh, we, we all, uh, we all like her a lot.  Yeah.  But, uh, you know, I can't more. 
[02:05:30]  Well, yeah, you got, you know, you got to choose your sides.  It's, uh, yeah.  And, uh, I get it.  You know, you, you, with some, look, you're, you're, with the same girl for a long time,  man.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden you're free.  It's hard to get right back into it.  Yeah, it really is.  So there you go.  Boy, you not get right back into it.  You just swing that thing around.  God bless you.  It's amazing.  It's like he's roping steer with it. 
[02:06:00]  God, he's fantastic.  It's, it's been fun to watch Ann over the years.  Just, uh, wow.  I want to start hanging at Anthony's house.  Yeah.  You ought to go by.  It's kind of a nice, uh, hang.  Definitely.  Uh, so the, did the exchange happen?  Uh, brings us to today.  Today?  No, not yet.  See, I talked to Keith yesterday.  So it's going to be Keith getting your stuff, giving her what she wants.  Keith talked to, uh, Jill also.  Okay.  And said he'll be by and, uh, take care of business like that. 
[02:06:30]  And that should be it?  That should be it.  That should be it.  And then there'll, no need for, you know, communication or text or anything like that.  I'm that smug guy though.  God damn it.  I know.  Well, he was there.  Yeah.  Reporting from the jacuzzi.  You know what I noticed today?  What?  That, like this whole, uh, the Jill thing has gone completely full circle because we  were in the office and it went from traffic girl and seeing traffic girl. 
[02:07:00]  Now she's back to traffic girl.  You actually, and I don't even know if you did this.  She's doing the traffic because Manhattan is a nightmare this week because of the UN.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden you, she's doing the traffic and you're not looking at her like you would  have looked at her maybe a couple of months ago.  All of a sudden you yelled out, what about 57th street?  I swear to God.  Did you, did you notice she did that?  It wasn't even like I used to date this girl.  Now you're like, where's my info?  Talk about 57th.  There's going to be one lane each way because of this UN crap.  That's exactly what you said. 
[02:07:30]  I'm like, wow, it's, it's gone completely.  Wow.  Yeah, you're right.  Jesus.  All right.  When we get back, we have another terrific interview that Sam did out there in LA.  All right.  This is the big one.  This is the big get.  That's right.  It's a NBC premiere week.  Today's show brought to you with limited commercials.  Thanks to NBC and NBC premiere week.  Right.  All right.  And I have big news.  Now I'll be on Fox red eye tonight.  Oh, Jimmy.  You watching that. 
[02:08:00]  I just never plug.  That's why I feel bad.  Plug it.  Boo.  Opium.  Anthony.  We were starting a new segment.  Yeah.  It's called the dumbest man in the country.  All right.  And I want to congratulate our first winner, young Eric Nagel from Florida.  Eric Nagel.  Eric Nagel, everyone.  Also known as Hoagie Boy, E-Swap, E-Fat.  So, Eric, what did he do, Jimmy?  Eric, could you please do your best here? 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  Try to convey the story you just told us in the exact fashion with the same amount of  enthusiasm.  Vigor and gusto that you did the first time.  Okay.  During the break, there was a discussion about how people in the 1800s couldn't understand  things that happen now, like a plane flying over, the particle machine and everything.  So, I was a machine, whatever it's called.  The collider.  So, I said, oh, a few months ago, they had posted photos online about this tribe in Brazil 
[02:09:00]  that no one's ever heard of, they've had no contact with.  But a plane was flying over, taking photos, and you see the tribesmen throwing spears and  stuff at the plane because they didn't know what it was.  And apparently, I had no idea that the whole thing was fake.  Oh, did you see that jerk?  Oh, did you see that jerk? 
[02:09:30]  It's fake, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too much time with Steve.  Why are you blaming it on Steve?  Exactly.  It's rubbing off, seeing anything on the internet and just believing that it's real.  He is a boob.  No one's denying that.  All right, Iraq, thanks.  You're welcome.  Yeah, Iraq, it was wonderful.  Going back to Anthony's spilling of the details of his Anthelini breakup. 
[02:10:00]  The demise.  He finally really got into it on the Ron and Fez show on Friday, and it was just great radio  to listen to.  But we figured this side of the show needs some closure, even though you don't need closure  in your relationship.  Not for myself, for the listeners.  As far as a radio bit goes, these listeners, they need closure.  Listeners always need a little closure.  So we're...  Closure.  We're playing some of the highlights of Anthony's time on the Ron and Fez show on Friday, which 
[02:10:30]  really was very good.  So we continue now.  A lot of fun with those guys, yeah.  We'll go with clip seven there.  All right, Anthony, just discussing the breakup and relationships in general and everything.  Sure.  Let's go over here to...  Here's Rob.  Rob wants to get some advice for you, Ant.  Go ahead, Rob.  I just wanted to say about Anthony, now that I've heard the fall of Nicolini, I always thought  you would be the sensible guy, the guy to stick it out and maybe end it with a little 
[02:11:00]  diplomacy as diplomatic as you went into it.  And I hope he's the guy who throws Canada wind and does it the wrong way.  You guys are flip-flopped.  No, that's actually the complete opposite of what really happens in real life.  I know, and I'm not going to speak for Opie and everything, but I know from knowing him  for so long, he's kind of the guy that will be more diplomatic with a relationship, especially  with ending it.  He'll talk to the people and things like that.  And he's kind of sensitive and he likes to go over the annoying things. 
[02:11:30]  Right, right, right.  It's like every time you guys get fired, it's more of a personal thing to him than it is  to you.  Yeah, I'm like, ah, you know.  Yeah, he's like Sonny Corleone.  Right.  You know, he's personal, he's personal.  And I'm trying to be, you know, more like the consiguiere and not really, you know, don't  take it personally.  Sonny!  It's also hard to care when you're drunk.  So that's why.  It really is.  That's why I try to stage Ronnie. 
[02:12:00]  Ronnie's a genius.  Ah, there we go, yeah.  God, I love Ron Bennington.  No, Ant and I are similar in that regard.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Yeah, I think we've put out enough info now that when we were on top of our game at  N.E.W., Ant and I were both absolutely miserable in our personal lives.  God.  We had the world by the balls.  Oh, and it just.  And we were both horrendous.  And other people had ours in their hands.  Right.  I just remember, like, when we used to, like, commute back to Huntington, and either you 
[02:12:30]  or I would go, ah, you want to take a few circles around the block before we have to  go home.  It's going down on Main Street a little bit.  Might as well just go around.  And it wasn't even anything great to see.  No.  That's how pathetic it was.  I would pull up in front of Anthony's house if I was driving that day, like, ah, you  want to do a spin around the neighborhood, see what's going on?  And then obviously nothing was going on, but it was better than, like, going into the  house at that given moment.  Oh.  And then Ant would do the same thing.  I would just be like, okay, now I can get home and new level in Half-Life. 
[02:13:00]  I'll just play it.  I've got to get through that game.  And then I walk in, and I've already been yelled at for going right to the computer when  I get in the house.  So I'd have to do this faux, I'm interested in sitting down and talking to you thing.  And as she's talking, all I'm hearing is, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  And I'm thinking, all right, I've got to get on top of the electrical generator.  I've got to pull two levers.  Get down.  Get past the water that's electrified.  All right, headcrabs. 
[02:13:30]  Jeez, I hate headcrabs.  Then the zombie things.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I just wanted to play the game.  And then I'd be like, yeah, I think I'm going to go over on the computer for a little while.  She'd sigh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I know Ant's told the story a lot, but can you?  Candle day?  Oh, my God.  Because I remember I pull up to Anthony's house, and all of a sudden I know where he goes,  oh, great. 
[02:14:00]  I'm like, what?  He goes, you see all those candles lit?  They were lit all over the house.  Dude, by that point in the relationship, the last thing I wanted was any kind of intimacy.  Right.  I just didn't want it.  There were no lights on in the house.  No.  There were just candles on.  The computer was good for that, too.  Done.  That's all.  I wanted no intimacy.  And I'd go, Ant, what's up with the candles?  Yeah, we'd pull up to the house.  There's candles all over the place.  That was romance night.  Wow.  The candles are all lit. 
[02:14:30]  When you have to schedule a romance night, the relationship is over.  Finished.  I'm serious.  And I don't want to hear from the married couples out there,  oh, with the kids and stuff, we've got a petrol in.  It's Tuesday.  There were no kids, by the way.  If you can't figure out how to get it done in between all the craziness that's going on,  then I think your relationship is done.  I think there's a problem there.  I just didn't want anything to do with her at that point.  It was pretty much nothing, nothing left.  And the candles would be lit, and I'm like, oh, Christ.  Now I've got to dig deep into my J.O. Rolodex while I just... 
[02:15:00]  Pretend it's anyone else.  Yeah.  While I just move like an oil derrick until it's over.  Ch-kung, ch-kung, ch-kung.  Is there anything worse than when you're in the Rolodex and they say something?  You're like, stop talking.  You're not on my mind right now.  Shut up.  You don't sound like her.  Exactly.  You don't sound like them.  You don't sound like him. 
[02:15:30]  Could you bark?  Don't ask questions.  You get the peanut butter.  Let's make this interesting.  That I feel bad for you.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it was just awful, and the candles were lit, and I'm like, oh.  So she'd be at the door waiting with a tall tumbler glass of Captain Morgan and Coke.  That helped.  She knew what she was dealing with.  Yeah, chug that down pretty quick.  And you're hogging it like Mr. Snuffleupagus.  Drink it that way.  Let's splash it over my back if I'm hot. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  So moving on, we're just about done with some of the highlights from Anthony's time on the Ron and Fez show.  Noon to three on XM Sirius Radio.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM, whatever that's being called these days until they change the name to something that makes sense.  So now, I guess the last thing to discuss is when you're going to go over there and get your stuff.  Get my goods. 
[02:16:30]  Hopefully we have an update on that, because this is from Friday, but this is how it went down on Ron and Fez.  Could you imagine I walk in.  She goes, how you doing?  And takes a frying pan and smacks herself in the head with it.  And goes, I've already called 911.  I'd be like, holy s***, I'm s***.  Now I have to, you know, kill you.  I don't know what you want to say about that, but that little tidbit is based on a real story.  Oh, yeah, that was my brother's episode. 
[02:17:00]  All right, I wasn't sure if you wanted to go there or not, because when I heard you say that on Ron and Fez, I'm like, wow, this is a real story that happened to Ant's brother.  Yeah, my brother's just a mellow guy, wouldn't lay his hands on anybody, never a girl, girlfriend, anything like that, no matter what.  Joe's a walk-away-from-the-situation guy.  He'll say, F you.  He'll go, you know, all right, you know something, enough.  And he'll just leave the premises, you know, drive to a friend's house or something.  And, uh, well, his, uh, during the time they were getting a divorce, his, uh, soon-to-be ex-wife, uh, he was over the house, he was doing laundry. 
[02:17:30]  I guess they were still living in the same house while they were going through this proceeding, which is probably the worst thing you could do.  So, and, um, they were in a little tiff and, uh, uh, uh, supposedly she had grabbed this frying pan and just smashed herself in the mouth with it and called the cops and was like, yeah, he punched me in the mouth.  And the law is you go to jail. 
[02:18:00]  So they cuffed him, took him to jail and he's got a pistol license too.  So they took all of his guns, took that away.  He finally got it back, uh, but he had some thing where he worked this outward.  He had a neighbor who, uh, his ex-wife was confiding in and he approached the neighbor and said, would you wear a recording device?  Are you kidding?  Yeah, that's how that worked out.  And they said, yes, wore the recording device. 
[02:18:30]  She got the ex-wife to, um, fess up to the fact that, yeah, she did smash herself and got him put in jail.  And, and then Joe went to court with that and was like, I'm going to file charges against you.  Did he file him against you?  No, it wound up getting, uh, he, he dropped it for a little trade of, you know, divorce stuff.  So, yeah, it, uh, I always wondered how that worked out.  I never, I never heard the end of that story.  There was a wire involved.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to wear a wire. 
[02:19:00]  Can you imagine all that happening to you?  Oh, what would you, I would lose my effing mind.  Yeah, then you could clock her for real because you're going to jail anyway.  That's what you say.  Like, look, I'm going to jail anyway.  So, all right, here's my real shot.  Punch you right in the mouth.  Unbelievable.  Uh, yeah, that was something.  All right, we're almost done with some of the highlights from, uh, your time on Ron and Fez here.  We go back to the tape.  I was wondering, uh, when she, uh, took your Escalade, uh, did she make copies of your keys?  Did you have to change your locks?  Um, that's a good question, but I did change my, my locks. 
[02:19:30]  I didn't want to, you know.  After the, uh, fire.  Yeah, you got to, you got to change, uh, you got to change the locks.  You don't know if anyone's making a cue.  Well, yeah.  Oh, I was worried about that one.  I go, oh, boy.  Yeesh.  Don't need any of those missing.  Yeah.  You know, those have to be kept secured.  Mm-hmm.  Went to the range this weekend.  Sure.  And, well, Danny's pretty good with the, uh, AR-15.  Oh, Danny's, you're getting to fire the gun?  Put Danny down to the range.  Some of those guns are absolutely ridiculous.  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  Especially the, the scope on, on, uh, AR-15.  Yeah, it's an ACOG.  It's like, it's basically like, just like cheating in a video game.  It's like, you put the code in, and then you could just, you could just shoot bullets  through the same hole over and over again.  It was ridiculous.  He had a ridiculous grouping, Danny.  First time shooting that rifle, uh, with a, it's an ACOG scope.  And it's funny, on the way home, he pulled a Master Poe without knowing it.  He goes, that scope's gotta go for what?  Like, 800 bucks?  I could do it. 
[02:20:30]  It's about three times what the rifle cost.  Wow.  But it's what all the Marines use.  Uh, it's, it's...  I don't get it.  I don't get the dialing in a code.  I'm such a...  It's, oh, like, like if you put in a, uh, a cheat code on a video game.  Right.  That's what it's like when you're shooting through this scope.  But you still gotta fire the gun.  You can't miss.  But how, how do you not miss with the cheat code?  You're so...  Because it's not a video game.  I don't, I don't get it.  The scope is so accurate, uh, that it's very hard to make.  You put the crosshairs...  Okay.  The bullet's going where the crosshairs go. 
[02:21:00]  It's just such a great optic.  It's, it's built so well.  How does it do that?  Because the crosshairs are above the, the actual chamber.  How do they fix that out?  Thank you, Jimmy.  I'm with you.  How do they work, like, how do guns work that out?  Where if you line some up with the crosshair, you're, you're like an inch or so above  the barrel of the gun, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How does it, how does it, like, why aren't you shooting below it?  It works out with the distance.  And when are you gonna take, you know?  When are you gonna take, you know?  And the elevation, you adjust for elevation.  Oh.  So I'm sure that's taken into consideration.  When are you gonna take Jimmy and I shooting? 
[02:21:30]  You go to the range, let's, let's go.  I know, I've never shot a gun.  Next weekend.  Maybe a BB gun.  You wanna go next weekend?  We'll go to the range.  I'd love to.  Oh, yeah.  I've never shot a gun.  Jimmy, it was a lot of fun.  It's a boy, it's a lot of fun.  I'm away, but I would.  Like 22s, though?  Yeah, a little into windows.  You gotta shoot something that you know you're shooting a gun.  This is like, kablam!  I mean, you know, there's outdoor ranges, but the one that we had went to over the weekend  was an indoor range.  Yeah.  And just firing very loud weapons indoors. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  There's something very, very cool about that.  Do you guys shoot side by side, then have the two things come towards you?  Like, ah, nice shot, Terk!  Danny actually said that one.  I didn't make the reference.  He goes, yeah, rooster!  Good shooting!  Good shooting!  We're bringing the target back.  Yeah!  Nice shot, but don't be cocky, rooster!  Is Dan a good shot?  Yeah, he actually is.  He's a really good shot.  I mean, obviously, he's got more time.  Sure, wow.  More time in the range than I'd have. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, right on.  It's fun with the, like, I enjoy shooting the rifles a lot, but the pistols are a lot  of fun, too, and you get that target way back there, and you realize how hard, how  much harder it is with a pistol than it is with a rifle, obviously.  Are you allowed to bring pictures that you want to shoot?  And, yeah, this one guy that was there had a target and everything.  I'm not even joking.  Like, can you bring pictures of the people you hate?  Yeah, you can bring any, as long as it's a paper target.  Right.  You know, you can hang it up on the hanger and put it out there.  It's fine, yeah.  Whatever.  Can you give a picture of someone?  Yeah. 
[02:23:00]  He said, yeah.  So can we make videos of this?  Uh, I think they technically frown on videos being taken in there, but I took a little  small video camera and place it up there.  Well, we'll bring some hidden cameras to your shooting room.  Hidden cameras.  All right, listen, we've got to finish up with this, because then we've got another terrific  interview that Sam did out there in L.A.  Ooh.  To finish up today's show.  Anthony explaining why he dates women a lot younger than him.  I did? 
[02:23:30]  This is from Friday's show, Ron and Fezzer's show.  Can I guess as to why, even though I didn't hear this?  Mm-hmm.  Because they're better.  That's my guess.  Because he can.  But you see, Ant laughs, we're all laughing.  It's a good thing.  Yeah, it's what it is.  It's a good, it's a positive.  That's what it is.  Well, you're having adventures, I know that.  Adventures, yeah, you've got to have adventures in life.  And by the way, I just don't get along with women my own age.  I just don't.  There's a woman, I don't even want to, I don't know what the hell she's talking about. 
[02:24:00]  It's like groceries and kids and holidays.  Ugh.  I want like Disneyland and candy.  Homework.  You want a girl who's going like this.  Oh, this is so good, you can't even taste the alcohol.  It's so good.  Yeah.  You want to be there for her first drink.  I like, yes, you should be there for their first drink, and it should be a Zima, and  they should love it.  Mmm.  Wow.  I really don't get along with, like, girls, women my own age. 
[02:24:30]  I get along with guys my own age, that's cool, hang out for the most part.  But, you know, but women my own age, they go through this phase where nothing's very fun  anymore.  They're not into having fun.  Like, fun is this scheduled thing that's got to be around everything they're doing.  It's just, and then the stuff they want to talk about isn't fun or interesting or spontaneous  or anything, you know, a bunch of old friggin' fuddy-duddies. 
[02:25:00]  Enough.  Do the wash and shut up.  When I was single, my sister set me up with a girl my own age, Crab Meadow Golf Course.  It was a golf day, because there's broad, like, golfs.  Of course she does.  I'm like, I have nothing to do.  All right, I'll go on this, you know?  And I saw her walking up.  I'm like, I picked up my cell phone.  I called my sister.  I go, I am going to kill you.  I couldn't relate whatsoever.  And this girl was probably, might have even been a couple years younger than me. 
[02:25:30]  She was so old-looking in my eyes.  I was like, you've got to be effing kidding me.  But I was a nice guy.  I should have just said, look, I'm breaking on hives, and I should have ran.  But just like Ann, I'm a nice guy.  I'm like, all right, let's play some golf.  And we're walking, playing golf, and the whole time she's hoping I'm going to ask her  out on a date.  And I'm like, there's no effing way.  And then I had to walk her to the car, and there was the awkward, you know, are we  going to exchange numbers thing?  And I kind of said something like, well, I'll see you around. 
[02:26:00]  Because my sister was working at some bar at a country club.  I'm like, ah, maybe I'll see you back at that place.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm sure sometime we'll have a drink.  I never saw her again.  I had nothing relatable with this one.  Can I say there's in The Office, the new one, like, not the new one, the Ricky Gervais  one, but the two-hour special.  There's a scene where he's going on blind dates, and he's putting an ad in.  You got to see the two-hour special.  And there's one that shows up at this restaurant. 
[02:26:30]  Because he's famous.  He's David Brent, and he's done this show.  So they're, like, filming it as a documentary, like, what happened to the office people after.  And she's, like, not obese, but she's just kind of a fat girl, like, chubby girl.  Like, she's a block.  A big girl.  She's a female E-Rock.  Oh.  Exactly.  Yes.  Oh.  Yes.  And his, when she goes, David, and his, like, his hesitation in answering her, and obviously 
[02:27:00]  wanting to get out of being, is so great.  The story sucked.  I really did just stop the show with a brick wall.  But trust me, it's so perfect.  We should bring in the audio.  I would like to.  Oh, okay.  Because I'd like to.  Yeah, it's his facial expressions.  Yeah, yeah.  Where he kind of does that curl his nose up thing.  Yeah.  Hey, one more clip from the Ron and Fez show on Friday when Anthony was spilling his guts.  One time the police showed up.  Yeah.  A little set up here. 
[02:27:30]  Sorry.  Ooh, they.  Basically, Anthony, you know, now that he's been single for a little while, with a little  relationship in between, he's having a lot of house parties and enjoying the hell out  of his life.  And he's telling a story of what happened at one of these house parties.  That's not a good story.  That's what happened.  That can't be good.  That happens when I'm over.  That can't be good.  One time the police showed up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The, uh, ooh, they, uh, they didn't knock right away. 
[02:28:00]  It was four cars, four Nassau County cars, and six officers.  Uh, they were called by the c*** that lives on an angle behind me.  Nice lady, I said, by the way.  They held up very stealthily and quietly and walked up to my back gate and were looking over  the gate for a while before they, uh, let their presence be known.  Uh, and they, they saw, uh, perhaps some nudity, um, perhaps some, uh, you know, they just saw  some things.  Um, and then they were like, they came in, they're like, Anthony, uh, and the music was 
[02:28:30]  blasting.  Right.  Uh, so the first officer, the first thing he said was Anthony, uh, it's f***ing Wednesday.  Throw my hands up.  What are you going to do?  And then they all just started talking about the merger and they go, you know, we were  watching you for a little while back there.  It was enough said like, Oh, okay.  And then the delivery came, a pizza guy came and, uh, I got, I got to get the door and now  the cops are talking amongst themselves.  So I go to the door and the pizza guy now sees four cars, uh, cop cars in front of my 
[02:29:00]  house.  He's like, what's going on here?  I just give him the money.  I go, nothing.  Get out of here.  You didn't see the thing.  I didn't see nothing.  Whatever.  The super bad cops are showing up.  Oh yeah.  They were very cool.  They were very nice.  Uh, you know, they, they just said, keep the music down because the woman there, and  they actually called her a, they said, she's really, she just bitches about everything.  This place is sounding more and more like the Tate LaBianca.  You can only hope for an ending like that too.  It just seems like the way we're heading here. 
[02:29:30]  Uh, Tate LaBianca.  We got up, we tried to press the key, there was blood on it.  We got in.  First thing we saw was piggies on the wall.  F and Ronnie.  Very good.  Hey, we got to take a break.  But the one thing that needs to be said that you did say on, um, Ron and Fez, I wish we  had that clip.  Not that you have to explain yourself, but people are like, wow, Anthony's out of control.  Wow.  Anthony's this.  Uh, but the, but what people need to know is, and you explained this on Ron and Fez, 
[02:30:00]  you, you were in two relationships that were pretty much 15, 17 years, 15 plus years.  If you count three relationships, three relationships, the past three relationships I've had were eight  years for the last one.  The marriage was nine years and the relationship before that was six years.  So you're talking 23 years, three girls, 21 years and, and a good, and a good boy. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And a good boy in those 21 years.  I mean, Christ.  Six years.  And that's six, eight, six, nine and eight.  I can't get past the year and a half.  Lucky, lucky you.  What happens to me?  I don't know.  Sense.  Dude, the wheels, the wheels start to wobble after three months.  They wobble?  After six months, the power steering is gone.  After a year, it's like the two of the tires are missing. 
[02:31:00]  It's like those things in cops where, you know, the guy's just going for broke.  How do you do that?  And at that point, you just hope the car doesn't break down on a road trip.  I just, I just.  You just hope it breaks down on the way to the supermarket or something easy.  And so, you know, the point being, then Anthony gets involved with Jill.  It looked really good on the surface to everyone involved.  Yeah.  But I'm just expressing what I, relaying what I heard on Ron and Fez. 
[02:31:30]  And then you felt like you were going right into the same crap you've done for the last  20 some odd years.  Like, here I go.  I'm right back in it again.  What the hell am I doing?  And that's, you know, I couldn't have that.  So instead of being honest and forthright, I decided to go the other route with my root.  And safe to say you're having a great time.  And this is what you want for yourself.  Hey, hey. 
[02:32:00]  So, and you know what?  It should be said.  We all like Jill.  It should be said.  We really did like Jill and all.  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  She was great to all of us.  It's bad.  You know, it wasn't, it was bad time for Ann and, you know, he needs to, you know, do  what he's doing now.  And that's, that's fine.  That's Ann's life.  But I don't want to make it sound like we're just like beating up on her because we all,  we all like her a lot.  Yeah.  But, you know, I like Ann more.  Well, yeah, you got it.  Yeah, you know, you got to choose your sides.  It's, yeah. 
[02:32:30]  And I get it.  You know, you're with some, look, you're, you're with the same girl for a long time, man.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden you're free.  It's hard to get right back into it.  Yeah, it really is.  So there you go.  Boy, you not get right back into it.  You just swing that thing around.  God bless you.  It's amazing.  It's like he's roping steer with it.  God, he's fantastic.  It's, it's been fun to watch Ann over the years.  Just, uh, wow. 
[02:33:00]  I want to start hanging at Anthony's house.  Yeah, you ought to go by.  It's kind of a nice, uh, hang.  Definitely.  Uh, so the, did the exchange happen?  Uh.  That brings us to today.  Today?  No, not yet.  See, I talked to Keith yesterday.  So it's going to be Keith getting your stuff.  Keith talked.  Giving her what she wants.  Keith talked to, uh, Jill also.  Okay.  And said, he'll be by and, uh, take care of business like that.  And that should be it?  That should be it.  That should be it.  And then there'll, no need for, you know, communication or text or anything like that. 
[02:33:30]  I ain't that smug guy, though.  God damn it.  I know.  Well, he was there.  Yeah.  Reporting from the jacuzzi.  You know what I noticed today?  What?  That, like, this whole, uh, the Jill thing has gone completely full circle because we  were in the office and it went from traffic girl and seeing traffic girl.  Now she's back to traffic girl.  You actually, and I don't even know if you did this, she's doing the traffic because  Manhattan is a nightmare this week because of the UN. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  And all of a sudden you, she's doing the traffic and you're not looking at her like you would  have looked at her maybe a couple months ago.  All of a sudden you yelled out, what about 57th Street?  I swear to God, did you notice she did that?  It wasn't even like, I used to date this girl.  Now you're like, where's my info?  Talk about 57th.  There's going to be one lane each way because of this UN crap.  Exactly what you said.  I'm like, wow, it's gone completely.  Wow.  Yeah, you're right.  Jesus. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  When we get back, we have another terrific interview that Sam did out there in LA.  All right.  This is the big one.  This is the big get.  That's right.  It's NBC premiere week, today's show brought to you with limited commercials, thanks to  NBC and NBC premiere week, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  And I have big news.  Now?  I'll be on Fox Red Eye tonight.  Oh!  Yeah, Jimmy.  You watching that?  I just never plug that, so I always feel bad.  Yeah, plug it.  Boo.  Opie and Anthony.  All right. 
[02:35:00]  Opie and Anthony.  We got Sam back in studio.  Very exciting.  Very exciting show.  We were supposed to fly out to LA to talk to the almost stars of some of these big NBC  shows, because it's NBC premiere week, right?  Right, Sam?  Yeah.  That's the big news.  That's the headline today.  People need to know.  A lot of great NBC shows starting up this week.  Yeah, starting tonight.  All the shows on NBC are premiering, The Office, My Name is Earl, you know, Heroes is going 
[02:35:30]  to premiere tonight.  It's a three-hour event for Heroes.  Wow.  Yeah.  Three hours?  Yeah, they're doing like a one-hour recap up-to-date thing.  Oh, that's a great idea.  Then a two-hour premiere.  And you a Heroes fan?  No.  I thought you would be.  Nope.  You should check it out tonight then.  Watch the recap.  No, you know something?  I'm not a fan of the show.  Well, I've seen a couple of episodes. 
[02:36:00]  Not a big fan.  What is it, the show?  Eh, they all have powers.  Ooh.  I heard it's good.  I'm actually going to say it.  I don't know.  Although Hayden Panettiere, she's kind of good to look at.  Although, this is not her women.  She's got a penchant for getting a little chubby, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  Not now.  No.  She's fine now.  But I see, in the future, I see a problem.  She's got a beautiful face. 
[02:36:30]  The body is average.  Juicy, man.  She's got youth.  No, it's good.  She's got youth on her side.  But, I don't know.  You guys are making NBC really happy they paid for this.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I mean.  I don't like the show.  Well, she's fat.  Yeah, I know.  How was your thing?  What are you going to do?  Hey, and your girl was on the Emmys last night.  I know she's getting a little too old these days.  But Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Who?  You're not into her anymore?  No.  I liked her on Party of Five.  That ship has sailed?  That ship has sailed. 
[02:37:00]  She's a prude.  She's a prude anyway.  Yeah.  She looked pretty hot last night on the Emmys.  All right.  That looks good.  Well, there you go.  That's got to be an older picture, right?  That was taken yesterday.  Oh, well, okay.  She's still doing it?  She's fine.  Now, she's always been all right.  Yeah.  All right, Sam, where are we at?  Let's get this crap over with.  Well, I got to show it over.  I don't know if phrasing it that way is proper.  We're going to get to the bottom of some of NBC's new shows. 
[02:37:30]  So, would you talk to a grip from My Name is Earl?  No.  The key grip, my friend.  Only the stars were at this premiere event.  There's a lot of confusion, by the way, because NBC spent a lot of money to fly Sam out and  have Sam come back with the interviews.  It was supposed to be a rah-rah NBC premiere week thing that we were supposed to do today.  They got to understand our show.  We got to be true to ourselves.  Exactly.  You're still getting the info out that you got some great NBC shows that are starting up this week. 
[02:38:00]  What can I tell you?  Did you happen to be on the plane with the winner?  Because I know there was a winner that was supposed to go out and hobnob with these people  at the Hollywood party.  You didn't even meet the winner of the big contest.  No.  Be on the other side of the velvet rope.  That was the winner.  Right, right.  Hey, and we'll see you on the other side of the velvet rope.  So, were you on the other side of the velvet rope?  Yeah, I was on the other side.  Yeah.  Who was the winner?  The side.  The good side.  No, the other side.  No, not that side.  The side where you have to reach over with your microphone. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That was you.  So, I wasn't on the red carpet.  I never met the winner.  Did he go?  As far as I know.  But we made it sound like it was a big thing.  I know.  Hey.  He's probably so busy meeting all the big stars of NBC that he was like, all right, Sam's  here.  Yeah, but look at these people from The Office.  Right.  These people from Kath and Kim, you know.  Radio contests suck.  It's a new show that's coming out.  Oh.  That's why I didn't hear it.  But I'm sure I will be hearing about it.  Yeah, well.  How bad do radio contests suck? 
[02:39:00]  Like, we made it sound like this guy was going to be rocking.  He got a trip to L.A.  He got to meet us.  We were supposed to, like, be his escort and show him around.  Oh, wow.  Escort.  Were you there by yourself the whole weekend?  No.  I flew back Friday morning.  When did you go out?  Wednesday night.  Jesus.  A little twink alone in L.A.  Yeah, I was.  What do you do when you're not getting the big gets?  I made $1,500 a night cooking on Hollywood Boulevard.  Okay. 
[02:39:30]  The boy of questionable race.  What did you do when you weren't doing the big interviews?  What journalists do when it's prepared.  A little research.  Journalist.  I'm a broadcast journalist.  Were you hanging out with anybody else?  Any of the radio guys or anything?  No.  I was actually in a different hotel than anyone else.  So there weren't even other radio people.  You know why?  Why?  Because they thought we were coming.  Oh, really?  And that's the stuff we demand.  That's why they do it.  Don't put us in a hotel at any other dumb radio show. 
[02:40:00]  Not even a joke.  Because they sent a stretched limo, I think, because that's what they had to pick up, like,  all the radio people at the hotel.  Yeah.  And I was in it alone.  Yeah, of course you were.  That was our limo.  Yeah.  So demanding.  We're asses.  And then at the last minute we go, you know what?  We're not even going to go.  We don't want to do this.  We'll send Sam.  I'm glad you did that.  It was set up nice for you.  Yeah.  All right.  So we talk about My Own Worst Enemy.  People might be just tuning in.  This is another NBC show.  It's what?  This is the premiere episode? 
[02:40:30]  My Own Worst Enemy.  It actually premieres next month, but that's something that I learned while doing the interviews.  Not information that I had before.  Oh, no.  All right.  So we don't want to talk about this show, then.  No, no, no.  It's a big, big NBC show.  This is their big show because this is Christian Slater's.  It's part of the premiere event.  It's just not on this week.  Right.  Okay.  It's part of the new fall season.  Okay.  And Christian Slater's starring in it.  Okay.  And Michael Malley is going to be in it.  Who the hell is Michael Malley?  Gee, I don't know.  He hosted a little show called Guts on Nickelodeon. 
[02:41:00]  That guy?  A little show named Guts.  Yeah.  Which I got to the bottom of in Hollywood when I talked to him.  Did you?  Yeah.  You were on Nickelodeon, if I recall correctly.  That's correct.  Me and Michael Malley do have a little something in common.  Yeah.  Hey, Sam talked to Michael Malley and brings up the show Guts.  Yes.  I'm here with Phyllis and Leslie from The Office.  Howdy.  Those two are still...  What?  If this doesn't prove my point from earlier, these zeros had nothing better to do than 
[02:41:30]  hang out with you the whole freaking afternoon.  Do you have the right track, Hugh?  This is a nightmare.  Wait, I might not.  Oh.  That's all right.  I'm sure they were still there.  I'm sure they were still just walking around.  Oh, Sam.  You're spitting up his face.  Good.  Oh, you got me good.  No, I'm just...  Up top.  All right.  That's a good one, Sam.  Is it the right track?  Oh, you're so fired.  Oh, I had a great rant and everything. 
[02:42:00]  Sam talks to Michael Malley about Guts.  All right.  So we're here with Michael Malley from My Own Worst Enemy on NBC.  Mike, what's the haps?  What is happening?  I get to play not only one part in this show, but two parts.  Is everybody playing two parts?  Because Christian Slater plays.  Christian's playing two parts.  Yeah.  I'm playing two parts.  Saffron Burroughs is playing two parts.  Those are the only people we know playing two parts so far.  Back in the day, you hosted a Nickelodeon game show.  Guts.  Call it Guts. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  Nice.  Guts is back.  Guts is back on Nickelodeon.  My family's got Guts.  So I'm bringing that same preparation to My Own Worst Enemy that I brought to Guts.  And let me tell you something.  I prepared a lot for Guts.  See, he tried to bring it back around to My Own Worst Enemy.  Yeah, of course.  He didn't want to talk about Guts.  But you know what?  The audience wants to hear about Guts.  And how I hate his.  Did you get a piece of the aggro, Craig?  I have a glowing piece of the rock. 
[02:43:00]  And I want to dispel a myth right now.  A lot of people think that they did not actually get a glowing piece of the rock.  They, in fact, did get a glowing piece of the radical rock.  It wasn't just like a phony prop thing?  No, it was like a trophy with a neon light inside made out of fiberglass.  What's the rock?  Well, see, in Guts, you had to climb the aggro, Craig, to finish, you know, it's like American  Radiators for kids.  Right, the aggro, Craig.  Yeah.  And so if you got to the top of the aggro, Craig, you got to go home with a piece of it.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  That was the big trophy.  A glowing piece of the radical rock, a.k.a. aggro, Craig.  Now that this show has been canceled, what happened to all the rocks?  Glowing rocks.  We gave them out to everybody.  I guess all the kids.  Real special.  All the people got them.  Phony prop thing?  No, it was like a trophy with a neon light inside made out of fiberglass by Byron Taylor,  the designer.  Do you think that, like, all the kids that won now just have the thing and the light's  gone out by now?  Maybe, but you know what I mean? 
[02:44:00]  Well, they can watch My Own Worst Enemy and a light will go off in their heart as they  see a great show and shut up.  I can't wait until it brings it back.  I got to hear them bring it back.  I know.  I want to hear them bring it back.  You know what I mean?  All those kids are probably old enough to go out and get that light fixed.  All right.  Well, My Own Worst Enemy is premiering this week, part of NBC premiere week.  October 13th is when we premiere.  October 13th.  They keep giving me misinformation.  What is that about that?  I don't know.  I think somebody's trying to make me look silly.  Is there something that we don't know? 
[02:44:30]  No, it is not premiering next week.  It is October 13th.  All right.  Who's the broad that you decided to cut out in post-production?  She obviously added nothing to your interview.  That's the chick star of My Own Worst Enemy.  She had nothing good to say, so you just cut her out?  I guess that's her name.  All right.  Was she any good looking?  She was all right looking, but I could tell just on her vibe that she's going to be good  on this show.  Yeah.  My Own Worst Enemy.  All right.  Sam talks to the star.  Yeah.  Wow.  You finally got a star.  Here it is. 
[02:45:00]  Three hours later, you finally got a star that we could play on the radio.  Here it is.  Did you get in the parking lot or an elevator?  No.  Me and him were sitting down and had a nice conversation.  You'll be able to hear the whole conversation on onaradio.com.  Cool.  Oh.  Got it in.  Christian Slater.  Nice.  Christian Slater.  Yes.  Yes.  Christian Slater.  Wow.  True romance.  He's actually on the East Coast.  Supposedly.  He wasn't.  Well, he will be November 15th in Boston.  See how fun it is to slide plugs in?  Oh, yeah.  Ah, the woman, who cares?  It's not important. 
[02:45:30]  Let's get back to the interview.  My plug means nothing.  He's just fun, though.  We're here with Christian Slater at the NBC premiere party.  What's the haps?  Thanks for having me.  Good to be here.  It's my pleasure.  Please.  Thank you.  So you're starring in My Own Worst Enemy.  Yes, sir.  How is it being on, you know, the star of your own TV show?  It's good.  I mean, it's just a pleasure.  All right.  Okay.  It sucks.  It's terrible.  What's he going to say?  Throw a hardball at him.  How is it, you know, being the star of your own television series that they're really promoting 
[02:46:00]  on, you know, on the network?  It's pretty much the flagship show of the new season launch.  How is that?  Does it really just blow?  The only thing he could have done to make that interesting is if Christian would have  said, well, it beats having AIDS.  It's not as fun as sitting in my house waiting for the phone to ring for my next project.  Yeah.  You know, it's right up there. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  TV show.  It's good.  I mean, it's nice to show up to work every day, and the show is a lot of fun, and the  writers are great.  Of course.  The guys that have been coming in to direct the episodes are a lot of fun, and it's a  wild schedule.  It's fun and great and wild.  I'm enjoying it, and it's a nutty, crazy show.  I can't wait for you guys to see it.  Nutty, crazy show.  It's a nutty, crazy show.  It does sound like it.  He really does know how to promote.  I would see it because I like him a lot.  I think he's great, and I would see the show because it conceptually seems interesting.  Yeah.  But enough with fun. 
[02:47:00]  Everything's fun.  It's fun.  It's great.  Fantastic.  Terrific.  Wonderful.  How is it pulling a train on Patricia Arquette?  That's what I want to hear.  Fun.  Fantastic.  Great.  Wonderful.  Terrific.  We're 25 minutes into his interviews.  About the show, My Own Worst Enemy.  Still don't know what the show's about.  No idea.  Because you didn't ask anybody.  Well, I mean, it's going to be on October 13th.  It's not like you're interviewing guys from The Office where people would probably know  what the concept is.  Yeah.  By now.  This is a brand new show. 
[02:47:30]  You know, hype it up a little.  When am I going to get another opportunity to sit down with Mike O'Malley and talk guts?  Well, you've got a point there.  Right?  Yeah.  You've got a point there.  I think my first question would be, Kristen, new show, My Own Worst Enemy.  What's it about?  Fill us in.  Well, I mean, I asked him if he liked being a TV star.  Right.  Now, you also, obviously, you have many film credits to your name.  Thank you.  You were also in Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.  Yeah.  Which is a good movie. 
[02:48:00]  Hilarious.  Were you guys just laughing at Kevin Costner's accent on the set the whole time?  No, no, we were all very young.  Of course.  Of course.  God forbid you were.  He's great.  No, no.  He was terrific.  He wouldn't do that.  Oh, yeah.  Why, was the accent bad?  Yeah, that's the movie that he kept going in and out of accent the whole time.  Yeah.  I think it came out in 1991.  Yeah, you're making a 1991 movie reference.  Yeah.  Yeah, that, oof. 
[02:48:30]  No, no.  No.  Kevin, he was great.  Fun, a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, you only.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they gave Kristen Schlater to you for three minutes, so why would you ask him what  the new show is about?  Well, I've always wondered about that Robin Hood thing.  Why would you ask what My Own Worst Enemy is all about?  Instead, let's talk about Robin Hood.  Not even a true romance-like reference where, you know, that's the movie everybody is thinking 
[02:49:00]  about.  Yeah.  I'm going to bring home something a little different.  Well, you did.  We were all very, you know.  That's what Jess says, by the way.  Sorry.  No, we were all very, you know, professional and we worked well together.  Did you kind of know, though, like when they would film scenes, you're like, well, he's  not doing the accent.  Why isn't he doing the accent?  I remember there was some confusion at certain times as to certain moments that were being 
[02:49:30]  filmed.  But the director was actually his best friend, Kevin Reynolds.  So they kind of had this whole thing going together.  And for Kevin to take on the role of Robin Hood was certainly courageous.  Have you ever heard anybody run in a circle like that without saying anything?  Wow.  No kidding.  That was, uh, he was really protecting Kevin Costner there.  Well, I guess you don't want to piss off Kevin Costner.  Why?  He hasn't done anything in 10 years.  Exactly.  He'll have sex with your wife. 
[02:50:00]  Good point.  Linger longer.  Very good.  You shouldn't criticize someone's acting.  We're doing the best we can.  Little lips.  I have little erasers on my feet.  And a wig on my head.  Looks like a rooster.  Certainly does.  Well, you know, when Tribeca gets fixed, won't be a moment.  I'll say, hey, you're talking to me. 
[02:50:30]  Shut up, Bob.  All right.  And this is how you wrapped up the great interview with Christian Slater.  Yeah.  Do you get worried that you'll get tired of playing the same character week after week?  That's the thing, though, with the show is that I get to play two characters.  So it very, it just, it doesn't get boring.  You know, knock on wood, it hasn't. 
[02:51:00]  And the way that the show hasn't been on yet.  The show.  He goes, it hasn't gotten boring yet.  You know, the show hasn't been on yet.  I still don't know anything about, but that show.  Filmed a few episodes.  He goes, he plays two people.  So it would take twice as long for him to get bored, I would think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was thinking, I, honest to God, was waiting to get a moment so I could say twice as long.  And then you did it for me.  Didn't really get a laugh.  That's all right.  It's more thought provoking.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  That's what I say to myself all the time.  The way that the writers have come up with all these different scenarios for Edward and Henry to be in.  It's really human.  It's very relatable.  It's, I think it's going to be a wild and crazy show.  I just can't wait for you guys to see it.  Wild and crazy show.  Exactly.  Yuck.  What happens in a, pick up George Michael in a toilet somewhere? 
[02:52:00]  How crazy is it?  He did that again.  What does he do?  George Michael caught in another bathroom.  With drugs this time.  Drugs though, right?  Just drugs.  No, uh.  Just drugs.  Nothing in his mouth.  Has he put on a hit recently or no?  I don't know.  No delicious treats dangling through a hole in the wall.  Poor guy.  Just can't wait for you guys to see it.  Well, great.  See what?  I was going to say it premieres this week, but I was very much corrected by Mike O'Malley earlier.  Yes, well done.  Yeah.  It does not premiere this week.  When does it premiere?  No.  It premieres October 13th, which is a Monday at 10 o'clock following Heroes. 
[02:52:30]  So check it out.  Heroes, My Own Worst Enemy on NBC this season.  Thank you very much.  Thank you so much.  Thanks for having me, man.  It's quite a good show.  Sam.  Honestly, good job.  That's a tough spot.  Thank you.  Those press junkets suck.  We hate doing them.  If we want to know what My Own Worst Enemy is about, we can unsolve the mystery altogether on October 13th on NBC.  Oh, when we all tune in to watch it.  Yeah.  Unsolve the mystery? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Unsolve the mystery?  What are you talking about?  Unsolve the mystery?  I was thinking of that show Unsolved Mysteries.  You have jet lag.  Maybe.  Maybe I'm just stupid.  All right.  NBC premiere week.  That's great.  It starts tonight with Heroes.  Yeah.  I can't wait.  You guys are definitely in the minority for that Heroes thing because everybody's going to be watching that tonight.  Well, I'm more a lost person than...  Nobody watches Lost.  Everybody.  Nobody watches Lost.  It's on that other network that nobody watches. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, that's on the A.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, let's not talk about that.  No, that show sucks.  It was good in the beginning, but it's awful now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you were saying The Office, Sam, that you're a big fan of The Office.  I said I was a big fan of The Office.  No, he said those other networks are lost.  Yeah.  They don't know what they're talking about.  Yes, that's exactly right.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  Anyone else get the feeling NBC's going to be asking for some money back later on this  afternoon?  We talked about those programs for quite a bit of time. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, ad nauseum.  Ad nauseum.  Yes, yes, yes.  Uh-huh.  Well, tune into all these fantastic shows on NBC.  Heroes Tonight.  You know, The Office and My Name is Earl later this week.  Oh, October 3rd.  Down and Dirty with Jim Norton on HBO.  Oh, yes.  Jimmy.  Thanks, NBC.  That's another network.  Why is CBS promoting NBC?  Because they're dummies.  Like, why are we?  Because we're owned by CBS.  Because they're desperate for advertising dollars. 
[02:54:30]  Okay.  There it is.  I was just wondering why we weren't pushing our own shows.  At this point, they want to promote Clear Channel radio stations.  They'll take Clear Channel's money.  They don't care.  They'll just take the money and run.  Unbelievable.  E-Rock, did you like the Sam interviews?  Huh?  Yeah, thanks.  What was your favorite part?  Oh, when he mentioned me about being fat.  That was great.  That's everyone's favorite part.  Hoagie boy.  Hoagie boy.  Hoagie boy.  All right, we got everything done, Ed. 
[02:55:00]  I think we did.  Well, we have the naughty language version of the show coming up.  Sirius XM.  Satellite radio.  I think we did good.  We can do whatever we want over there.  We're going to give a lot of post-manity.  Yeah.  It'll be fun.  How great was Michael K. Williams?  Oh, he's fantastic.  On the Sirius XM side on Friday.  Good enough that it made me go out and buy season one and two of The Wire, which I will  now start watching.  We finally had Omar.  He was better than I ever thought he could have been.  Great guest.  He hung for two hours.  He loved the show. 
[02:55:30]  Just BSing about anything.  Loved it.  He was a great guest.  Big fan of mine.  I mean, it just was so wonderful.  I was a bit jealous.  I got to admit, man.  You guys are having a great time.  Also, for the people that are really into the Opie and Anthony show, I know you got the  fringe listeners and the casual listeners, but for the people that like searching out  everything that is Opie and Anthony, intern David, when we set him up with the porn star  and made him believe that there was a jealous husband in studio crashing through the door  and was going to kill him, that video is now up on YouTube. 
[02:56:00]  A lot of pixelation, but we're trying to keep it on YouTube because they like to just yank  anything that has anything to do with nudity, but if someone cracks their head open and might  be dead, they'll show that video no problem.  So, intern Dave gets terrified on Opie and Anthony.  That's your search if you want to check that out.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Later.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah.  Hello.  Good evening. 
[02:56:30]  Hurrah.  There we are on XM.  Serious XM.  Yeah.  Saddle.  Serious XM Saddestrial.  Why don't they just call it Serious XM Saddestrial.  Serious XM Saddestrial.  Serious XM Saddestrial.  Serious XM Saddestrial.  Serious XM Saddestrial.  Yes, Serious XM Saddestrial.  How about fucking eczema?  How about rosacea?  It's fucking XM.  Serious. 
[02:57:00]  You won the fight.  You got the company.  Big deal.  You got bigger dicks.  However your name.  Take the name.  XM's easier.  FM.  AM.  Serious.  What?  Yeah.  Are you serious?  Yes.  And XM.  It's easier.  It's up to jokes.  This was a hell of a takeover.  Every Thursday people are getting fired at this point.  Is that what it is?  Thursday's firing day?  If they're listening in Washington, Colin's sick this Thursday especially.  This is going to be a bad one.  Thursday there's a bunch of unfolded boxes waiting at the door for you to pick up. 
[02:57:30]  Oh yeah.  Fold it up into a big box.  Get to your desk.  I love how they say it's a merger because it was a hostile takeover.  Yeah.  Load up your little Ziggy cartoons you pinned up in your cubicle.  Fucking it's over.  Mel was like Gordon Gekko at Teldar Paper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just like.  Yeah.  Go on, right?  Yes.  Yes.  I just like looking at you confused like that.  That was a great reference.  His greed is good where he fucking shitcanned everybody.  Yeah.  He just chopped heads off. 
[02:58:00]  Oh boy, did he.  Hey, my thought, not that anyone cares, but I say you come up with a completely  brand new name because I think both companies had some rocky roads.  They both had a rocky road to where they're at today and you just kind of like clear the  field and start over.  Something new.  Oh.  Like.  I was at.  This means nothing.  I understand that.  I'm going to start acknowledging some of the stuff I say means nothing before I say  it.  It'll make me sleep better at night.  I was at Shawnee Inn up there in the Poconos. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, the Poconos.  I was driving home from Scranton and I did a little drive by because my parents were  You wanted to go in this big champagne glass?  No.  Oh, I thought that was every place in the Poconos.  That's on the other side of the mountain.  The hacky side.  The trashy side.  Yeah.  My parents had a timeshare up there for a long time and I went to show them the girl.  A little of my past.  So we went to Shawnee Inn for lunch.  And they have a golf course there that I guess used to have like PGA championships and stuff 
[02:59:00]  or PGA whatever.  And they had pictures on the wall.  Dude.  Jackie Gleason teeing off on the first fucking hole at Shawnee Inn.  And I thought of you yesterday.  Wow.  That's the only reason I'm bringing it up because I know you're a big Jackie Gleason fan.  Gleason.  But they had many pictures of him.  I guess he went up there and played a lot of golf back in the day.  Yeah, he was based in New York.  It wasn't a Hollywood thing.  Right.  He did the show out of New York.  So I'm sure he spent time up there.  That's where all those bastards went for entertainment. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  It was the thing to do.  Like all the people left the city and went up into the mountains for the weekend.  Now they go out to the Hamptons or down to the Jersey Shore.  But in the day, it was the mountains.  It was all about the mountains.  And they had pictures of Bob Hope.  They had pictures of Ed Sullivan teeing off.  Arnold Palmer.  Did I say Mickey Mantle?  Mickey Mantle.  So I just thought of it.  A little history.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  I saw that piece of that show about Gleason.  What's his name from? 
[03:00:00]  Brad Garrett?  Yeah.  How was he?  He was.  It's so hard for anybody to capture Gleason.  You know what I mean?  Especially when they had the scenes of him doing the show.  And they had him doing the lines that you just remember Gleason doing.  And Alice, the woman that played Alice, was doing her lines.  And some of the lines are different than they are on the show.  I don't know whether they were able to get rights or it was a problem.  I'm not sure.  But he fucking looked. 
[03:00:30]  They made him up where he looked like him.  But he's not fat.  How'd they do that?  I don't know.  They put some kind of prosthetics on him where he looked like Gleason.  And not only the makeup, he was able to actually make some of the faces that Gleason made.  And his mannerisms were really good.  And the voice wasn't really there.  And like I said, when he's doing, they're doing scenes from The Honeymooners.  You're just so used to seeing Gleason do it with Audrey Meadows that seeing anyone else do it, it's like,  Oh, yeah, you're trying too hard on this line. 
[03:01:00]  But he did such a good fucking job in that.  Really looked like him.  I do an amazing Gleason voice, but I can't do it.  Obviously, I don't look like him.  Oh, damn.  Let me hear.  No.  I'll do it.  Oh, all right.  Here comes Ted Gleason.  I didn't even think of that, but no, I wouldn't do it.  That's a different character.  Oh.  Go to the moon, Alice, because there's no atmosphere.  Ted Gleason was never Jackie's unfunny brother. 
[03:01:30]  Ted Gleason.  And he'd just repeat everything Jackie said, trying to be funny.  Yeah, but he would kind of just ruin it.  You are a blubbermouth.  No, it's blubbermouth.  Excuse me, I was talking to E-Roc.  I lost her somewhere.  What was this?  A movie?  Yeah, it was like a TV movie that was made a couple of years back.  I have that, too.  I've never seen it.  Really?  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  It shows some of the behind-the-scenes stuff of how he went from doing his variety show 
[03:02:00]  to doing The Honeymooners, and how the producers were like, no, this is stupid, because people  aren't going to sit there and watch a half hour based on one sketch that you do.  And he put his money behind it, because the producers weren't paying for it.  Didn't it not do well in the ratings, too?  At first, but it wound up being, you know, he always regretted not continuing and doing  more.  Oh, really?  Because they actually had Brad Garrett, is it Garrett? 
[03:02:30]  Garrett, G-A-R-R-E-T.  Yeah, Brad Garrett doing older Jackie Gleason doing an interview, which was really fucked up  with the, remember the gray mustache he had and everything?  They had him made up like that, and doing like one of Jackie Gleason's final interviews,  where he talks about regretting not continuing with The Honeymooners a little longer.  But he did a lot of episodes, didn't he?  How many episodes?  It was just, the real ones are only the 30, the, yeah, 39 episodes.  But that, a little insight on how he was a womanizer, I mean, he, some of the Jackie 
[03:03:00]  Gleason dancing girls were kind of, his squeezes.  Yeah, and they have, he was doing that skit where he fell off the ladder and really broke  his leg, so he's in the hospital, and there's some girl just like, oh, like, rubbing his  head and everything, and he's like, hey, baby, and then his wife walks in and just starts  really giving him shit.  He apparently tried to hide the girl in the closet.  I was going to say that.  Good boy, yeah, good boy. 
[03:03:30]  But it was cool.  It was a TV movie, and you knew it, so you kind of go into it with that, but, you know,  being a Gleason fan, I thought it was pretty cool.  Well, he, Jackie was fucking great, man.  He was like one of those guys that were like, the boys are fun, and broads are load receptacles.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  He was just a womanizing, drinking motherfucker who just wanted to have a little fun.  Apparently, there was something with his father, though, and some issue where he was trying  to please his dad, which I don't know if they added it for drama or if that was really 
[03:04:00]  the case, but...  The real guy probably didn't care.  Yeah.  I told a story once, like, yeah, whatever.  Just grab a bitch by the head and start fucking...  There you go.  Suck my dick.  There you go.  Suck my pudgy dick.  Like, he would have all...  Everyone would travel on a train, and he would get music, and it would be a fucking party,  Yeah, yeah.  It would be a fucking party, man.  It was all guys smoking cigars and playing cards, fucking laughing.  I think he'd...  I guess he'd have chicks there to fuck, but, I mean, he wouldn't bring the girls.  No, the girls were there.  They were in, like, the back car. 
[03:04:30]  Exactly.  Yeah, go to the back car and get laid, and then come back and have some more fun with us.  But, I mean, their wives and chicks, he wouldn't...  Yep.  No.  That's a bunch of broads with fucking, like, hookers.  They, uh...  The cast that they got was pretty good, too, because the girl that played Alice was really  good, and the Norton character was amazing.  I don't know who they got to do that, too, but really pulled that off.  Same with the entertainer, I think.  Oh, yes, right.  It was Cedric.  But even he was saying stuff in the show, like, well, you know, he said, oh, do you 
[03:05:00]  know what...  Somebody asked him, do you know where Jackie is?  And he goes, you know I don't see him until we're on the air.  Like, it seemed like Art Carney and Jackie Gleason didn't really have any kind of a rapport  with each other off of the show.  I heard that Gleason had this thing you would do, too, where he forgot a line.  And I think of this every time I watch The Honeymooners.  If he forgot his line, he would rub his stomach, like, if he was, um, trying to remember.  I don't know if that's true, but it makes sense, because I heard he hated to rehearse. 
[03:05:30]  They were great with bailing each other out, which is something the show needed, because  yeah, they didn't rehearse.  They just kind of went out there, and if somebody flubbed the line, the other person was able  to pick up, and without making it awkward, make the person remember the line by saying  something, or goofing on the situation that they forgot the line.  Yeah, it was really a bunch of very talented people on that show.  I was going to say, they were real...  Except for Trixie.  She was talented financially, though, because she's the only one getting paid for the fucking 
[03:06:00]  show.  Her brother was a lawyer, I think, right?  Joyce Randolph?  Yeah.  They were real...  We'll take some money.  But they were real entertainers, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, where you could go out there and wing it.  They all came from the stage, and where you're performing every night, and if someone flubs  a line, you can't say, wait, we've got to do that over.  You've got to just go with it.  He'd just get done with the show.  They'd go out on the stage, and he'd talk to the crowd and shit like that.  Mm-hmm.  You just...  Now, you never fucking really get that kind of shit, and get people that are able to  work off the cuff like that. 
[03:06:30]  It was live TV, and in those days, it was like they had no content freedom.  Like, you couldn't even think about sex.  They had a real narrow corridor.  Yeah, yeah.  And now when these dumb sitcoms promote, they're going to go live one time.  It's like, whoa.  How are they going to do this?  Jackie Gleason and the rest of them are rolling their eyes wherever the fuck they are  going, we did this fucking every week.  Yeah.  Please.  And they make it such a big deal.  Yeah.  It was live. 
[03:07:00]  Something might happen.  I went out live twice.  The original Colin Quinn show was the three episodes you did on NBC.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Which were 9.30 on Mondays, and I was on two of them, and you went out live.  It was live TV on NBC on the SNL stage.  It was intimidating.  I mean, because you knew if you fucked up.  I remember Patrice forgot a line, and we were sitting there.  He had us sitting at this table, and Patrice forgot something.  I was watching him, and it was so funny to me.  I knew, I forget, I knew the line, but he was reaching for it. 
[03:07:30]  I'm like, oh God, he fucking forgot what he was supposed to say, this idiot.  It was wonderful.  Watching your friend fucking forget himself.  Yeah, I would love to see those now.  I forgot about the NBC episodes.  I watched it recently.  I watched the monologues.  I forgot about that.  Colin's monologues on NBC.  It annoyed me to this day that fucking Jeff Zucker, who was there for the last one, didn't pick him up.  He liked the show, but it was just too edgy.  The racial stuff.  Nah, it's too bad.  The fucking monologues Colin did were great.  People on Instant Feedback, they all went and saw Ghost Town. 
[03:08:00]  Not all, but a bunch of people, and they're saying it's a good movie.  Yeah, it looks good.  And that Bob Kelly and his fat arms flailing had them laughing really hard.  So, hey, Brooklyn Ace was on hold, and he had to go do his job, I guess, and he wanted to know what's going on with our contracts.  Oh.  And I was going to tell Brooklyn Ace, well, Anthony spilled the guts on that on Ron Afez as well.  Well, I kind of said, actually, I was pretty good.  I was like, I don't think you've got to worry about that.  It's being taken care of, and don't worry, and blah, blah, blah. 
[03:08:30]  I would like to know, I will say this, everything is not fixed.  I don't think that we are secure yet.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, no, no.  At all.  I don't believe that either.  I don't believe things are.  I've seen no paperwork.  I've seen no nothing.  You know, I don't care what anybody says.  No, you're absolutely right.  Until shit is signed, until people have signed stuff, until there's definite stuff.  It's all just, hey, we like you.  Yeah, do you? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Let's get some stuff done.  Hey, you're great.  Yeah?  Yeah?  How about a little thing that rhymes with schnontract?  That's how I do it.  I'm clever.  That's contract, by the way.  Perhaps more than that.  Anthony will be giving the updates on his next Ron and Fez appearance.  All of my Ron and Fez appearances.  You'll get the scoop over there.  Do you know I've never sat in on Ron and Fez?  Oh, you should.  It's fun.  I always feel like I'll be intruding. 
[03:09:30]  It's good time.  No, you know what?  You sit down.  You let Ron be the captain of the ship.  And you just kind of chime in.  And there's plenty of good subjects for stories.  And then Dave is just retarded.  So he's a lot of fun.  You know what it is?  It's a lot less pressure.  Because you're like, yeah, if it's a bad show, it's not on us.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what I mean?  That's why it's fun to do the show.  It's no pressure.  You go in there, and if it works, great.  If not, eh, it's not my show.  Dave's got the funniest gimmick now. 
[03:10:00]  What is it?  When Ronnie says something, and Ronnie's great at doing the subtle joke that, like, you know  exactly what he's talking about, but it's so subtle and barely there, but you're laughing  because you know what it is.  Right.  And then Dave will just go, oh, you mean come.  He's just the obvious, let me just throw out, even though everyone got it in the genius,  subtle way that Ronnie presents it, Dave just blurts out the obvious answer.  Yeah.  Captain obvious.  Yeah.  It's really fucking funny. 
[03:10:30]  I like it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I was getting at, Dave.  Yeah.  Thanks, Dave.  Hey, we got a Hoagie Boy trailer.  Hoagie Boy trailer?  How are they doing this?  This is Derek and Steve's latest.  In a world with unlimited food possibilities.  There's a giant cape napkin around his back.  One man refused to stop eating.  A pocket full of chips. 
[03:11:00]  A crunch, a crunch, a crunch, a crunch.  A crunch, a crunch, a crunch, a crunch.  And eating.  And eating.  Where's my Hoagie slippers?  He pushes feet and they're actual Hoagies that he's taped up.  Yes.  He drives a Hoagie-mobile.  Car runs on vinegar and oil.  Coming this winter.  Hoagie Boy's enemy is not, it's not kryptonite.  It's an expiration date.  And sometimes he eats it and gets all sick and shitting. 
[03:11:30]  Diarrhea from bad Hoagies.  Eric Nagel is.  He's not allowed into the halls of justice because a lot of times he liquid shits down his legs.  Superman slips in it.  He gets all mad.  He gets paralyzed.  Hoagie Boy.  And he just walks into the room slowly with two Hoagies in the hand.  And he takes a bite out of each one while a crime's being committed.  Just watches the crust.  He helps no one.  Bravo.  Good job.  Hoagie Boy.  Hoagie Boy. 
[03:12:00]  Hoagie Boy.  He stinks.  Hoagie Boy fucking stinks.  He's a fucking boob.  Hoagie Boy is a boob.  And can I just say to someone, that picture of you is very, very sexy.  Oh, can we see Jimmy?  Well, I'll show you after.  Can after what?  Why?  I won't blow up your spot.  Oh, no, I know.  I don't think you'll blow it up at all.  Oh, no.  Not at all.  I might have left my phone over at, uh...  What?  No, I didn't. 
[03:12:30]  I got it.  I got it.  What?  That scared me because I need my iPhone 3G.  Honey, don't be fresh.  All right.  Hey, um...  I was looking at some of the other stuff that is going on today.  A couple weird things.  In a world.  Yeah, it was very funny.  Oh, yeah.  Well, not...  This isn't that weird.  One-third of, uh, white Democrats...  Yes.  ...have a negative view of blacks.  One-third of white Democrats...  They asked them a few questions.  It doesn't have...  It's not quite a negative view. 
[03:13:00]  They asked them a few questions, and they...  What were some of the questions, you know?  ...they answered yes to them.  Um, just their basic impression.  Of, uh, black people.  And not all black people, but...  And it was like...  They think they're portrayed as...  It's a weird way they ask the question.  As, like, lazy.  Or, um...  Uh, prone to crime.  Things like that.  And that's how they answered it.  So, I don't think it's that accurate.  Mm-hmm.  And ask some Republicans. 
[03:13:30]  I'd like to see those numbers.  If a third of Democrats...  I think the reason you say it's not accurate, because you think that it should be two-thirds.  It should be...  Because I'm shocked to hear you talk like this.  Well, I...  I...  I'm one...  I never believe stats, because it's all in how you ask the questions, and...  You taught me a lot about stats, and you never took a stats class.  No.  Nah.  I learned a lot about stats from you.  It's so ridiculous how they could make things seem one way, you know, for their own purpose. 
[03:14:00]  What was the...  Percentages are the best.  What was the one about families that really opened my eyes?  You said something about families that eat together.  That eat together.  There was a survey.  Yeah.  The kids are less prone to use drugs.  Right.  Something like that.  And it's like, it has nothing to do...  If a drug-using child and a shitty family get together a few nights to eat, the kid's  still gonna do drugs.  It's like, if you're in a family that does have dinner together, you probably have a good  communication with your parents, and that's what keeps you off the drugs.  Not this magical, we sit down at the dinner table. 
[03:14:30]  Right, right.  Cure for a kid doing drugs.  And percentages, it's like, the highest...  They say that the fastest growing population of people getting AIDS now is elderly women.  And it's like, well, if you look at it percentage-wise, if there were two with AIDS, and now there's  four, it's a 100% increase in the number of people.  But yet there's only four on the face of the earth.  So they can make it sound like, wow, old ladies are getting AIDS all over the place. 
[03:15:00]  Old ladies are getting, you know, stuck in the fart box.  And it's still primarily gay men and African Americans that are getting a disproportionate number  of cases of AIDS.  They do that stat.  It gets the people talking.  It's from fucking intravenous drug use and unprotected and unsafe sex.  That's what you're getting.  The old people.  They like to fuck.  They like to fuck. 
[03:15:30]  They like to...  We like to fuck.  Oh, she's cute.  Will you let me see the picture, Jimmy?  It'll be done right now if it wasn't for my AZT.  We do have independence clips today.  More for you.  Yes, for them.  Ah.  Good.  Jack, South Carolina.  How are you?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Good.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, thanks a lot, man.  Really appreciate it.  See how that slows everything down?  Go ahead.  I'll talk quicker.  I'm just teasing.  Hey, listen, Hoagy Boy needs an arch enemy or arch nemesis, and I think it should be Jared 
[03:16:00]  from Subway.  No.  Hoagy Boy's arch nemesis is Scale Man.  He's a flat thing with numbers on him, and whenever Hoagy Boy steps on him, everyone laughs  and points.  That's what Scale Man does.  When Hoagy Boy runs into a room to save somebody, Scale Man lays there.  He's got to have a couple, though.  Like every superhero doesn't just have one nemesis.  So, maybe Treadmill Man. 
[03:16:30]  I knew Ant wasn't feeling Scale Man, and he was right.  Scale Man sucked a bag of baby dicks.  Scale Man's good.  Scale Man.  I like Scale Man.  He's getting fucking hepatitis.  But elliptical girl, I believe.  What about, does he have a sidekick?  Did we talk about that?  Hoagy Boy and his sidekick?  He tried one, but he hurt his back.  And he slipped out of his Hoagy shoe.  His Hoagy slipper.  He fell out of his Hoagy slippers outside.  He's right there.  Oh, look at him.  Shaking his head. 
[03:17:00]  Motherfucking Hoagy Boy, sucking dick.  Rolling his eyes.  Poor Hoagy Boy.  Eyeing his roll.  You used that already?  You certainly did.  I think I did the other day.  With the same zeal.  I apologize.  With the same zeal.  I'm such a phony.  This is weird, too, today.  Led Zeppelin reportedly planning on touring, which isn't weird.  A lot of people want to see the Zeppelin again, right?  Sure.  They're planning on touring without Robert Plant.  He wasn't really a big part of the band, to tell you the truth. 
[03:17:30]  Very replaceable.  No, he was.  He was a lead singer.  Literal Jim.  What are you talking about?  Literal Jim?  How do you...  That's just silly.  How do you fucking tour without Robert Plant and call yourself Led Zeppelin?  The Doors try to do that crap.  I know.  Yeah, it doesn't work.  And they had some cool singers.  They had the dude from the cult.  The Doors went out to try to be Led Zeppelin?  It was so silly.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  They're like, what are you doing?  We don't exist yet.  You're dead.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I'm just tired.  It doesn't...  Yeah, that doesn't quite work.  You could probably get people, though, that sound like them.  There are enough people out there.  Well, that's the latest trend, because...  David Coverdale?  Well, yeah.  We get him, maybe the guy from Tesla, maybe.  But, no, we talked about this recently, that the latest trend is bands just going out and  getting the new singer that sounds exactly like, you know, the singer that doesn't feel  like doing it.  Yeah, sounds and looks like they did in their heyday.  Like Journey? 
[03:18:30]  Journey.  Yep.  And Boston doing it with the guy from Home Depot.  Remember that break we did?  But at least he died.  Like, when you look at that guy, Brad, whatever...  Brad...  Brad Delp.  Brad Delp, yeah.  All right, he's dead.  But Steve Perry's alive, and this fucking Asian kid is fucking...  Not to the band.  He's dead to them.  Yeah.  Fucking...  They hate him.  They really do hate him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now that's the latest thing.  Is Zeppelin's going to go down that road without Robert Plant?  Come on.  What?  What?  Just because Robert Plant... 
[03:19:00]  Robert Plant ain't that good these days, and we've been through that plenty of times.  I just don't...  I ain't feeling his vocals no more.  I'm a huge Zeppelin fan.  I can't...  I can't imagine paying for a ticket to go to Madison Square Garden to see, like, Zeppelin  without Robert Plant.  You know what it would be...  I'd rather hear an out-of-tune Robert Plant.  Dude, it would be so cool to just see fucking Jimmy Page and hear the songs the way you remember  them.  Fuck if Robert Plant don't want to be up there.  Get a guy with some curly blonde locks and shove him up there to fucking sing like he's 
[03:19:30]  got no balls.  Florentine 10 years ago.  Florentine have the long hair.  Why?  Well, and not only are they thinking of a touring without plant, they're writing new material.  New songs.  Now...  That's kind of cool.  And Travis came in and goes, the three guys are writing new material.  I'm like, no, there's two guys.  Yeah.  And John Bonham's son.  Now, who wrote most of the biggies for Zeppelin?  Was it... 
[03:20:00]  That's a really good question.  Was it Robert Plant?  That's a very good question.  Was it Jimmy Page?  I think a lot of them were Page Plants, right?  I think so.  Page Plants.  Yeah, sometimes they just put the name on there for publishing.  I understand.  I'd like to know who really wrote the fucking things.  That's a good question.  What did John Paul Jones do?  Yeah.  Did he write some of that stuff?  Maybe he wrote everything.  He did or alive?  Maybe Bonham wrote every fucking hit.  Imagine if that happened.  Like a Foo Fighters arrangement.  Yeah, sure.  So...  And Robert Plant, Travis pulling out, is doing very well with... 
[03:20:30]  He doesn't need the Zeppelin thing anyway.  He's...  What is he?  Going out with the lute these days?  Pretty much.  He's doing like folk music with that broad...  What's her name?  Alicia Krauss.  Alison Krauss, right.  Alison, I'm sorry.  Alison Krauss.  They had a Grammy record together and everything.  They're successful.  I didn't realize how successful they were.  They were at Bonnaroo and I was...  I thought they were like, what the fuck is this pairing?  I actually said that.  I'm like, what the fuck is this pairing?  Like angrily.  Like I had...  I was onto something.  You have to.  I don't know if I ever heard... 
[03:21:00]  I haven't either.  Do we have their single?  All right, this is...  Oh, is this the girl from Benson?  What?  My teeth hurt when I said that.  Wow.  Does anybody remember laughing?  Be more funny.  It's very rare that I'm actually embarrassed after a line.  Can you explain that one? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Because I was really even trying to figure out, like, if I have the knowledge to get that  one.  The lady from Benson.  Yeah.  It was Krauss.  And so I said...  So you have to be a Benson fan to get that joke?  A Benson...  You have to be a real Benson fan.  You have to be a hardcore, I go to the conventions every year, Benson fan.  Right.  So the ladies...  I hear you, Benson!  I barely know who Benson was.  Robert Guillaume.  Robert Guillaume. 
[03:22:00]  Guillaume, or fuck his name.  Or whatever it is.  And it was the governor.  He's getting angry.  Did you watch Benson every week, Jimmy?  I haven't seen Benson in fucking ten years.  I'm waiting for a new episode.  You remember Krauss.  No, you're not.  I hear you!  He would always motherfuck him behind her back.  I wasn't a big fan of Benson.  No.  He was a snotty black guy.  He was the original smug guy.  He had some...  He was pretty funny.  Yeah.  Some soap.  And he got his own...  Wow. 
[03:22:30]  All right, listen.  I am to radio what fucking a tub full of water is to radio.  So, just completely stop it.  Explain it.  A tub full of fucking El Zolcho.  Listen, why don't we listen to Alison Krauss.  Okay.  And Robert Plant.  This is why he doesn't feel like doing the Zeppelin thing.  I don't think I've ever heard this.  Not a fan of the Robert Plant solo projects.  Although, Tall, Cool, One, Yes. 
[03:23:00]  It's a great song.  It's different.  Like the Honey Drippers?  Yeah.  When everything seems okay, baby.  You wake up and find that you're alone.  Because I'll be gone.  This beat is fucking great.  Gone, gone.  Really gone.  Gone, gone, gone.  Yeah, but you can't make a bad song using that beat.  All the...  This is the Beatles.  It's all of them back in the day. 
[03:23:30]  They all had that kind of thing.  No other baby, not no other man.  I want to be your lover, baby.  I want to be your man.  That's what song this is.  Flying, a stairway.  Gone, gone, gone.  Because you did me wrong.  You know what?  It's a good song.  Yeah.  Anyone could sing it.  This would be a good song in 1968.  Eight.  But what's so special that Robert Plant's singing this with her? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, he doesn't have to sing this.  She could have got any dude.  Anybody.  But it's Robert Plant.  Maybe this stuff's easier to sing live, too.  Like, when he's doing this, this is all stuff he originally sang with the voice he has now.  Oh, gotcha, yeah.  As opposed to when he had a much younger voice.  So he can go out and say, look, I'm singing.  Fucking Norton makes a point.  After that bomb before.  You've absolutely been.  I'm standing in a smoke-filled crater, and I make a point.  I raise my finger triumphantly.  No laugh, but a point. 
[03:24:30]  Hoagie Boy wants to know if we want to hear another song by this.  We do.  This duo.  Well, please.  I can picture Hoagie Boy enjoying it.  He's got two Hoagie fucking buns on his head with a little thing attached to him.  He's got music piped into it.  Hoagie headphones.  Oh, wait.  We got another arch.  Yes, sir.  We got another arch enemy coming in for Hoagie Boy.  Oh.  That's why I was distracted.  Cool.  I'm sorry.  Michael in Atlanta.  Yeah, I got a nemesis for Hoagie Boy.  I'm a doctor sit-up.  I didn't hear you. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, we didn't hear you.  Doctor sit-up.  Doctor sit-up, yeah.  One more time.  Yeah.  Not again.  Boo!  It was a doctor sit-up.  Doctor sit-up.  Doctor sit-up, everyone.  All right, let's hear the other one.  Hope Hoagie Boy cuts his hand off.  Some kind of accident that easily could have been avoided.  Of course.  He hadn't been holding a hoagie.  He puts it in an elevator to hold the door so he can go down and get his chips. 
[03:25:30]  Cut his hand off.  There's something to be said for dying young in a band.  You don't like this?  Jim Morrison, Janice, Jimi Hendrix.  It's nice, but what do you do with this? 
[03:26:00]  Well, he's probably close to 70 years old.  He's in his mid-60s.  Exactly.  What do you do with this?  Elvis, even.  Right.  This is like, this is what happens when the people don't drop dead.  I need Travis, because they're ripping off Stupid Roland turned me on in that dumb movie,  and I sat through it with the guy and the girl.  A love story, but they sing a lot of songs.  I spit on your grave. 
[03:26:30]  They're ripping off, uh, huh?  Once.  Once.  Thank you, Danny.  Once.  I didn't need Travis.  I had Danny right here.  Travis talking to my ear.  Oh, okay.  Roland turned me on in this movie once.  He did?  Yeah.  Sounds like a chick flick, dude.  The guy's a musician trying to find himself going through a breakup meets this girl,  and they're singing songs for the whole thing.  I like music and lyrics.  That song, that movie was great.  Was it?  I didn't see it.  Why would I see that? 
[03:27:00]  I know.  To tell you the truth, there was a few months I was kind of hostage to shitty movies.  To be honest with you.  What was the worst movie you had to see?  I was just going to ask that.  What was the worst movie you had to see during that hostage?  Love Actually.  Love Actually.  Adam Ferrara's in that.  That's why it sucked.  My friend was in a shitty movie.  No, it's the one with the, around a political campaign.  I fell asleep.  I didn't care.  I just.  No, bad.  The only reason.  It's horrid.  It was on TV one day, and I saw Adam Ferrara in it. 
[03:27:30]  Is that the one that he was in?  I didn't.  Love Actually, yeah.  It's a terrible name.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we play the hit song from The Once?  All right, listen.  Tell me.  That wasn't it, though.  The actual, the worst one I saw was that stupid one with the fucking, where they're on the boat.  And, yeah.  The Natalie Wood story?  Not.  Oh, Kate Hudson?  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Fool's Gold?  Fool's Gold.  Oh, boy.  They're saying that's one of the worst movies ever made.  Yeah, well, I'll concur.  People are saying. 
[03:28:00]  And people are saying.  People are saying.  Yes, people are saying.  Yeah.  This Alison Krauss and Plant, this is what they're doing.  This is the, this is Once.  The hit song from Once.  It's a scene.  And this is the vibe they're going for.  You can turn it off a little bit.  Maybe it'll sound cooler if you turn it off.  Holy shit. 
[03:28:30]  This is putting me to sleep.  Wait.  This is terrible.  Wait for the hook, man.  This is the hook.  See?  This is droning.  This is what Planet Krauss are doing.  I would, I would bet 10 people are enjoying my observation.  It's fucking awful. 
[03:29:00]  All right.  Here comes the hook, at least.  Is it?  Bring it on home.  Take this thing.  Sing, Kimball.  I'm bored at home.  We've still got time.  Raise your hopeful voice.  You have a choice. 
[03:29:30]  You make it.  This is the same fucking song.  Wait.  Which came first, though?  Ah, this.  Wow.  Whatever.  That's what Krauss and Planet are doing.  Jeez, that's horrid.  That was a huge soundtrack and a huge movie for the chicks.  For the chicks out there.  All right.  We got dumbest person alive.  Then we're going to take a break.  Then we're going to...  Didn't he just play the clips for us?  He's rolling his eyes in there. 
[03:30:00]  Or eyeing his rolls.  Look.  In the dumpster.  Laying in a chaise lounge.  It's a lump.  It's a tumor.  It's...  Hoagy boy.  Hoagy man.  Danny's got it set up for the dumbest person.  Look.  In the toilet.  Under my shoe.  Hardening and turning white on someone's lawn. 
[03:30:30]  It's Hoagy boy.  I wish I could...  Look.  In a sandbox being buried by a cat.  Hoagy boy.  Hoagy boy stinks.  He's the fucking worst.  His Hoagy shoes are so old.  He actually has to tape it with duct tape. 
[03:31:00]  The rolls around his Hoagy feet.  His shoes always fall off when he clicks his dumb heels.  He clicks his heels whenever someone says Hoagy.  Because he thinks he's getting one.  And his little Hoagy shoe is swollen.  So he had to duct tape the fucking buns clothes around his fat feet.  Fucking Hoagy boy steps on a rusty nail.  Hoagy boy is taking on a life of his own.  Everybody wants in.  Nick in Massachusetts.  It's Nick.  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  Hey, Nick. 
[03:31:30]  Hoagy boy.  Let's see if you can survive your archenemy.  Gymnasium.  Gymnasium.  Yeah, just pause a little bit, Nick.  That's good.  It's a good line.  Let's say hi to John in Brooklyn.  John.  Hey, guys.  I want to say one.  That was an awesome movie.  You know why?  I can totally explain once to you, and you guys are going to be like,  Oh, I've never thought about that before.  Yeah, go ahead.  Once you guys were ever in a garage band.  That movie is all about what it's like to be in a garage band, 
[03:32:00]  because the big scene in that movie is they go into some studio,  and they want to make an album, and the producer's like,  Yeah, whatever.  Mongo.  Yeah, his sidekick is Sloppy Joe.  Sloppy Joe.  Hoagy boy and Sloppy Joe.  Sloppy Joe has little Sloppy Joes on his feet,  so no one wants him on the shag carpeting.  Get Sloppy Joe off the white shag. 
[03:32:30]  Hoagy boy.  Let's go to Scott in California.  Scott.  Hey, I got a good sidekick for a hoagy man.  It's a hoagy boy.  Hoagy boy.  Yeah.  The sneaky snacker.  I hope you're killed in a fire.  What?  He was just trying to contribute to the show.  Sneaky snacker.  He was trying, Jimmy.  Hey, I hear him all the time talking about a sneaky snacker.  No.  She's done with jet fuel on you.  All right.  Dumbest person of the day.  That's hoagy boy. 
[03:33:00]  What's this about?  Yeah, this video's been making the rounds the last few days.  It's a woman.  She's taking cell phone video out of her car.  Like, she's driving and taking a video out of the windshield of her car.  Okay.  And she's describing what she's seeing.  That's pretty much all the setup that you really need for this one.  Is this the same lady that does all that, the rainbow?  No, no, no.  It's a totally different show.  Oh, okay.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, so just keep that in mind as you listen to this audio.  She's driving.  She's taking a cell phone video.  A cell phone video out the window.  All right.  Here we go.  All righty. 
[03:33:30]  And this truck driver's insane.  We're on 35 going north, and he is moving in reverse up 35.  I've never seen anything like it.  He must be.  I mean, I'm going 70 miles an hour.  Oh, no.  And he's going faster than me in reverse on 35.  All right, shut it.  Shut it.  Shut it.  Please.  Crazy.  Okay.  You want to play what's wrong with this audio?  Yeah, yeah.  I know what she's fucking seeing. 
[03:34:00]  I think it's obvious everybody.  Because it's freaked me out a couple of times.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's freaked me out a couple of times.  I'm like, what the fuck is?  Oh, but why would it freak you out if it looks like it's on an angle a little bit?  Sometimes you can't tell if you're looking directly behind it.  This video is being shot from directly.  Exactly.  She was shooting it from directly behind.  So a truck is being towed, obviously.  A truck is being towed.  From her perspective, it looked like it's going 70 miles an hour.  It never freaked me out that I thought the truck was doing 70 backwards.  It's just if you get a quick glance at first, you think maybe somebody's driving the wrong way down the highway. 
[03:34:30]  But instantly you go, oh, yeah.  It's being towed.  That can't be possible.  Because I've been on this earth long enough to know that it would be ridiculous to actually think that.  This dummy.  For longer than a second.  Actually thinks the truck is doing 70, going faster than I am.  Jesus.  Is there more?  That's it.  No, unfortunately, that's it.  But the fun part of that video is actually reading the comments.  And on the eighth page of comments, after like 350 other people, somebody has to go, well, it's obviously being towed. 
[03:35:00]  It's like, well, yeah.  Yeah.  A thousand people already beat you to the bunch of hell.  All right.  Dumb broad.  We got to take a break.  I have some great Hoagie Boy stuff coming in, too.  What's a Hoagie Boy?  Arch enemy Jenny Craig is coming in.  Scott from Massachusetts.  All right.  Listen, we're going to take a break.  We have our super agent here today.  Super agent Bob Eatman.  And we are. 
[03:35:30]  This is what goes on when things like contracts and things like that come up.  Yeah.  We're very committed to continuing our show for the listener.  But not today.  And it takes, well, sometimes it takes a sacrifice.  And people say, well, that's been a lot lately.  Well, this is the time.  But once, you know, things are all taken care of.  Right. 
[03:36:00]  Then, you know, we're back to normal.  But during this time, there are appointments and meetings and things like that.  That does supersede all other commitments.  And that is the truth.  We're committed to continue, which means we have to leave early today so we could get that done so we could continue.  Right.  Right.  So we can go until, you know.  What we're going to do, though.  1130, quarter to 12.  We played some of the highlights, but I really, I was sitting home on Friday and I was just glued to the radio.  Anthony spilling his guts on Ron and Fez. 
[03:36:30]  E-Rock spent most of the morning kind of cutting out some of the fat.  Not that there was much.  E-Rock.  And got to the meat and potatoes of.  They thought it was a suicide attempt.  As he always does.  Oh.  And we got to the meat and potatoes of Anthony's visit to the Ron and Fez show, which was just great.  Him spilling his guts about, you know, the relationship that just ended, some of his past relationships.  Sure.  And I think it's definitely worth replaying again, especially because we got to, like, check out early today. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  So after the break, you're going to hear Anthony on the Ron and Fez show from Friday.  It's really, if you haven't heard it yet, it's worth sticking around for.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow, all right?  Right.  All right.  All right. </pre>
