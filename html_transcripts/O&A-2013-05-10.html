<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion of Opie's severe allergies, leading to a phone call with Dr. Steve who provides medical advice.  The conversation veers into a discussion of phosphenes, the visual disturbances experienced when pressing on the eyeballs.  The show then shifts to a discussion of Charles Ramsey's rescue and subsequent media scrutiny, followed by a discussion of Ariel Castro's sentencing and his mother's apology.  This sparks a racially charged conversation about parental responsibility and crime, fueled by a caller, Mars, who translates a Spanish-language interview with Castro's mother.  The hosts and callers engage in a contentious debate on creationism versus evolution, laced with offensive language.  The segment concludes with vulgar jokes about animal evolution, specifically giraffes and rhinoceroses.

The show continues with a nonsensical discussion about a bizarre creature, possibly an alligator snapping turtle, followed by a story about a gorilla staring intently at a caller's baby.  The hosts discuss a video of a child falling into a gorilla enclosure and being surprisingly protected by the gorilla.  The conversation then turns to the dangerous practice of "noodling" for alligator snapping turtles, with a Louisiana caller describing the technique and its dangers.  Anthony recounts stories about his ex-girlfriend, Melissa Stetton, throwing various objects at him, and his scandalous trip to a Paul McCartney concert with Lexi while still involved with Stetton. The segment ends with regret over a missed opportunity to skinny dip with promotional models. Bob Saget is mentioned as a scheduled caller.

The recurring theme of the missed skinny-dipping opportunity is revisited with sexually explicit details.  The conversation then focuses on Alan Thicke Jr.'s last day as an intern, highlighting his poor hygiene and fear of a former coworker, Danny, described as "the biggest asshole."  The hosts bet Alan money to shave his eyebrows, a bet he accepts after pictures of his childhood lack of eyebrows are shown.

The show transitions into a discussion of video games, followed by the planned eyebrow-shaving prank on Alan.  E-Roc is involved, and after an accidental shaving cream mishap, Bobby Kelly arrives to assist.  Bob Saget calls in during the prank, promoting his Showtime special, unaware of the event unfolding.  The segment features further discussion of Alan’s new appearance, with reactions from other interns.

A subsequent segment starts with a discussion of a homosexual encounter, which segues into more commentary on Alan's shaved eyebrows.  This segment is heavily laden with offensive racial slurs, sexually explicit jokes, and crude comments about bodily functions.  Alan’s Rockstar job interview, Bobby Kelly's impending fatherhood, DJ Who Kid's travels (including stories about public nudity in Thailand and unsafe sex in Australia), and differing cultural norms regarding public nudity are discussed,  interwoven with more offensive jokes.  Interns Lauren and Nicole, and executive Jason Shibiru, join the discussion.  The segment concludes with promotion of Dollar Shave Club and further discussion of Alan’s situation.

The final segment focuses on physical appearance insults, particularly concerning pubic hair.  Alan’s chin hair is compared to pubic hair, sparking further vulgar jokes and comparisons among the guests and hosts.  The conversation shifts to behind-the-scenes gossip, with accusations and counter-accusations. Sal confirms calling Danny "the biggest asshole," and Alan is pressured to nominate the current "biggest asshole," ultimately choosing Troy. The segment concludes with plugs for guests' projects, a playful attempt to get Alan to say "Slabo," a brief discussion of Sal's sexuality, mentions of DJ Hookin's performance, and plugs for podcasts and other ventures.

How far? 
[00:08:30]  Way out east  Oh  Oh okay  Way out east  Like like um  North Fork shit  Oh okay  I was gonna say  At the point where it splits  Oh yeah  You gotta make that all important  North Fork or South Fork decision  Oh yeah  Way out east  But to be fair  My brother's like  You don't have to show  But I know I gotta show  Now that you know  When you're free  You have to  Well it's funny  Because he's  He's a scientist guy  Marine biologist  Slash scientist  So he doesn't believe  In the God thing  He was angry that day  My friends  He doesn't believe 
[00:09:00]  In the God thing at all  Yeah  I don't know what he believes  Can't God be a scientist  That's all I want to say  I think they have that type  They have every  Every mix of religion  You could think of  With science and religion  Right  Like every level  Of the scale  From there's only religion  And everything else is bullshit  To there's only science  And religion is bullshit  And then in between  There's every little piece of it  So some people believe  Like you know  The whole evolution thing  But they think about  An entity  A God  And then 
[00:09:30]  There's religious people  That do acknowledge  That there is a science thing  Right  So where does he fall  Into that gray area  He falls into the  I'm going to mock my wife  For being a believer  All right  That's what he does  He mocks all the ritual  Of the whole thing  Does he yeah  And kind of like  Bats his eyes  And looks down at people  Like oh you silly people  For believing  He's a man of science  But he allows  But he allows  That's nice for his wife  He allows it to be  He allows his wife  To you know  Push his kids  His kids  And their kids 
[00:10:00]  Down the religious path  Into that  Down that religious path  Right  I don't know  What the fuck to believe  But I certainly  Don't mock it  Right  You know  Your beliefs  Are your beliefs  That's how I look at it  And how does it hurt  In the end  Yeah  For most people  Unless you're fucking  You know  Killing millions of people  Because you believe  Your religion is better  Than someone else's  But most of us  Don't fall into that category  No no no  Extremism  How could it possibly hurt  Yeah  I don't know  You gotta 
[00:10:30]  I can't  I find it very difficult  To believe  In the written word  Of religion  Like the bible  And things like that  Oh the bible  Is completely ridiculous  It's just ridiculous  And it has nothing  To do with  Like holy entities  And things like that  It's written by people  Fucking years  And years  And years  After  600 years  Yeah  So  I mean really  They got everything wrong  Then back then  They weren't special  Holy people  They just got  Everything wrong 
[00:11:00]  Back then  The earth was wrong  Everything scientific  Was wrong  The planets  The sun  The fucking  Everything  And they blow that  Part of the bible off  Yeah  But the other stuff  Is sacred  In the word of God  Of course  The word of God  Word of God  Well why didn't  God say  Hey idiots  The earth isn't flat  Yeah  How about you start there  I made this shit round  Right  Can we get Dr. Steve  Off my fucking back  So we can move on  With the radio show  Oh my god  Hi Dr. Steve  Jesus  I guess we did call 
[00:11:30]  Ask you to call  Didn't we  Yes  Dr. Steve  Good morning boys  Self serving  I got the allergies  When did the  When did the allergies  Finally say  Alright enough already  And let most of us go  June  You mean at what age  No man  It's allergy season  But when is the fucking  Trees all grown in  So it's not as bad  As it is right now  Oh oh oh  Well  You know the thing is  You don't always  Get allergies  To the things  That are right around you 
[00:12:00]  Sometimes the  He just woke up  You need a few minutes  To wake up  No no I'm okay  You sure  I can hear it in your voice  Sometimes the allergens  Are brought in  Through the gulf stream  So for example  In Tennessee  We will sometimes  Get allergies  You know the symptoms  To allergens  That are brought in  From Texas  Jesus  Wow  So it's not always  What's right around there  So it may be  What's  Where spring 
[00:12:30]  Is happening  Somewhere further  South from you  Alright but in general  When is allergy season  Over for New Yorkers  Oh  End of spring  First of summer  You know  So when is that  Like mid June  Yeah like in June  Alright so I gotta  Deal with this shit  So now I got  Like the worst  Dry  Scratchy  Cough  Slash sore throat  Shit  What do I do  Well  And I'm doing this 
[00:13:00]  Because there's other  People out there  Oh sure  I'm doing it for them  I know  Not myself  Exactly  You know  Assuming it's not a virus  And it's actually  It's not a god damn virus  I'm just saying  Assuming that it's not  If I don't have a fever  It's not a virus right  Most of the time  Yeah  It could be a cold  Colds don't have viruses  I mean don't have fever  So bad  That's true  Okay  So you have to  Treat it symptomatically  So the stuff  That you could do  Over the counter  Are things like 
[00:13:30]  Washing the allergens out  So I do believe  The neti pot  Is useful  Or  Neti pot  If you don't want  To do the neti pot  You can just do  Jeez this is your  Argumentative today  You can just use  You can use  Saltwater nasal spray  It's called  Ocean nasal spray  Just to clean  The shit out of there  Let's get some of that  What is it called  Ocean nasal spray  Ocean nasal spray  I'm going to try that  Right now  Saltwater nasal spray  Don't get confused  Don't get confused  With ocean spray 
[00:14:00]  Like cranberry juice  That would hurt  You're not allowed  To make me laugh  Because it really  Fucking hurts  No  Or salt water  Any allergen  That you can wash out  That the body  Doesn't have to deal with  Is one less symptom  You'll have to  Okay  All right  Okay  Number two  If you have nasal  Congestion  Nope  Not really  A couple sneezes  And I'm good  I'm on a little  Claritin right now  Okay  Well  A stuffy nose  Needs a decongestant 
[00:14:30]  So you would use  Sudafed  Or one of those  Type of medications  Sudafed  Yeah  Or Afrin nasal spray  Which works so great  That you can only use it  For three or four days  Because it becomes addictive  So  I love that Afrin  When I have a cold  For runny nose  Afrin's my sister  You use your Claritins  And your Zyrtex  And that kind of stuff  Now  If none of that other shit works  Then they can  That's when they start  Putting you on steroids 
[00:15:00]  And stuff  Ooh  Roids  This was supposed to be  A two minute phone call  Oh  Go ahead  Very thorough  Go ahead  Go ahead  It's being very thorough  Go ahead  At that point  You use the fucking  Steroid nasal sprays  And uh  And then  If that doesn't work  Then you gotta go  Get allergy tested  And get decent  A 12 gauge  Right  That'll clean you out  Nah it's the same shit  Every year  Right around now  Sal told me  You were asking about  The weird patterns  You see when you 
[00:15:30]  Push on your eyeball  Well this is  Yeah it started with  And has all  You know  Oh it gets frightening  You know  And you rub your eyes  Real hard  And then you stop  Uh you're thinking like  Ah it's never coming back  I'm blind  Right  And then you know  It slowly comes back  What's that about  You ever get those  Weird patterns  It looks like a  Moiré pattern  You remember that  From when  Moiré  White shows  When we were kids  Yeah it uh  Yeah there's like  Little white things  That dart around  In front of your eyeballs  And uh  Well they're not  In front of your eyes  They look like they are  There's actually a name 
[00:16:00]  For those things  They're called  Phosphenes  Phosphenes  Phosphenes  Awesome  Phosphenes  Phosphenes  Flowey  Moving around  Your eyeball  Dr. Steve  How  Why  Educate  It's stimulation  Of the retina  Caused by the  Mechanical pressure  So when you push  The retina  Is fed by blood  Like every other  Tissue in your body  And uh  When you push  On the retina  The pressure  Kind of drives  Some of the um 
[00:16:30]  Uh  Some of the blood  Away from the retina  And also  You know  The mechanical stimulation  Stimulates the rods  And cones  And they start firing  And you see these  Lights  This kind of weird  Light show  And uh  Yeah it can actually  Uh  If you push  Hard enough  Which I don't  Recommend that you do  Uh  Your vision will  Will fade  During that time  And it'll be taken over  By these phosphenes  Which eventually  If the blood supply  Returns  And the pressure  And the retina  Returns to normal 
[00:17:00]  Then you're  You know  Those will fade  And get your regular  Vision back  Oh I don't like that  At all  No not at all  We're an amazing  Uh pile of just  Goop  Goopy meat  Goop  Goopy meat  That seems to  Fucking  Electrified  Locomotion  And electricity  And it's just  An amazing  Thing  We see things  Until it all  Starts breaking  Down  Oh god  Hey uh  Happens right around  58 which is  Right where I am

[00:18:30]  Map that your  Brain has  Internal map  Yeah it forms  A 3D map  Of your surroundings  If you close  Your eyes right  Now and turn  Your head to the  Right  You'll kind of  Know where the  Corner of the  Room is  And the only  Way that that  Can happen  Is if there's  A map inside  Your brain  That has  The corners  Of the room  And the features  Of the room  That also can  Move in 3D  So when you  Move your head  To the right  It's the corner  To the left  Why don't blind  People have that  No they do 
[00:19:00]  They have their  Own  Not really  Yeah  Put a blind  Person here  You'd be really  Fucked up for a while  Feels amazing  Their own  Map  Just having  They have the  Opportunity  Having things  Like depth  Perception  And  That stuff  Is just amazing  How it works  How the fuck  That shit works  I got my eyes  Closed  And Ant  Is two inches  To my left  No  Way over here  Where  Over here  Oh  How come 
[00:19:30]  The shitty map  We got all this  Shit going on  That's all amazing  And stuff  But you know  Cut a finger off  It don't grow back  Like a lizard tail  Yeah  What the fuck  Yep  Dr. Steve  Ant brought up  Something else too  When you stare at  Your stupid smartphone  For too long  Right  And then  All of a sudden  You hit that point  Of no return  Where you get  The weird headache  And the wooziness  And the  Oh yeah  What are some  Of the other symptoms  It can't really  Focus properly  It feels like  A hangover  It's  You know 
[00:20:00]  You're not  You don't just  Have a headache  From looking at  Something without glasses  But you get this  Overall weird  Dizzy feeling  And equilibrium  Problem  And it's  What the fuck  What is that  Yeah  It is really  A form of eye strain  Oh boy  And I get this  Myself  Where  You know  My eyes  Become fuzzy  And then my brain  Becomes fuzzy  Along with this  And it's  The best theory 
[00:20:30]  I've ever been able  To come up with  Is just that  You know  The brain  Is very closely  Tied in with the eye  And  We're  You know  We were  We were designed  To look across  A grassy plain  And see a  Saber tooth tiger  Chasing us  And we weren't  Really designed  To focus on  You know  A bright object  That close to our face  And it has something  To do with that  I don't have a better  Answer than that  That doesn't sound right 
[00:21:00]  What if there's some  Kind of  You're a caveman  And there's some  Dumb spider  Really close  You're going to want  To be able to see  That as well  Flitting in and out  From long vision  To far vision  And we were designed  It's just like  We were designed  To eat a variety  Of foods  And so when people  Eat mcdonald's  Every day  You know  It fucks them up  Right  And I think  It's the same thing  With charles ramsey  Computer ice  Like charles ramsey  Yeah  Poor guy  Yeah  That went horribly wrong  And we said it too 
[00:21:30]  We said by friday  He would be knocked down  Done  Because we just  Don't want a fucking  Hero in the end  Yeah  Alright dr steve  I think you gave us  Some great info today  Thank you  I like the little  Dr steve  Information  Sure  Segment of our program  Thank you boys  Alright dr steve  Go back to sleep  Sorry we won't get  Get the boys up  Alright there he goes  Weird medicine  9pm saturdays  Alright thanks buddy 
[00:22:00]  He's great  I love waking him up  You can just tell  At the beginning  As he's trying to  Like get his shit together  I'm a little woozy  He has to sound like  A doctor all the time  Aww  Aww  Yeah  Alright  We said charles ramsey  We said  Like what a great story  He saves those three broads  In Cleveland  Yeah  And we said it  I think on monday  Or tuesday  I guess it went down  Tuesday right  Oh yeah  We said by friday

[00:23:00]  I guess  He's in jail  Eight million dollars  Yeah he's not getting out  Anytime soon  No  He's done  And they're looking to  Go for the death penalty  Wow  But I think that's a  I think that's a reach  I guess it's for the  Unborn children I guess  Right  Because in Ohio  They have some law  Killing unborn children  Right  It's an aggravated  Murder charge  Something odd like that  It's kind of dumb  Just to talk about  The death penalty 
[00:23:30]  Because it's rarely used  It just really is  Unless you're in  The great state of Texas  Texas understands  Oh do they love  A good fucking execution  They understand  Hell yeah  That's a good way  To you know  Handle people  And what  Castro's mom's  Speaking out  What did she say  Oh boy  She's asking forgiveness  From the victims  Or something  Oh yeah  Oh good  Oh yeah  Forgive them then  Mom said so  It's Mother's Day Sunday  Apparently  Oh great  Yeah  Yeah  Forgive  How about no

[00:27:00]  Why  Your community  Talked to you  Or something  Because you're the one  That has said many times  On this  This program  That all Hispanics  Touch kids  He said all Hispanics  Are sexual deviants  Right  Is what  So now you're backing  Backing off that a little bit  I just got a couple  Come here  Let me talk to you  For a second  Of course you did  Oh shit  Of course you did  So we have good and bad  In our races  Okay  Uh huh  Which I agree with  But man  Do you think certain races  Are more prone to  Fall into certain areas 
[00:27:30]  Of criminal activity  Absolutely  Than others  Yes  Like  Just as simply  When you're watching  An episode of Cops  And you hear the call  Come in  You kind of know  What race  They're going to  Respond to  Yes  You know  They're in  Detroit  Let's say  In Cops  And you hear  You hear this  Over the radio  We got a  Shooting  At  The 1600 block  Of  Bloody

[00:29:30]  Then dressing up  Their little girls  As hoochie mamas  For parades  And what not  With little bippy tops  And fucking bellies  Showing  And they're fucking  Six years old  I think the problem  Starts there  You see  Why do they  Dress them like that  I don't know  Like little  Hoochie mama  I can't imagine  Doing that  It's crazy  Well that  Hispanic girl  De Jesus  Is her name  De Jesus  De Jesus  De Jesus  I'm trying to relate  To you guys  That's like  I'm trying to relate  To you guys  White people  No  It's de Jesus 
[00:30:00]  We know it  De Jesus  What's wrong with you  But I read  Initially  He's the weirdest  Guy ever  So strange  You love me  But I read  Initially  That she had to  Walk to school  40 blocks  And back  40 blocks  Now  Walking that much  Every day  And if you have  A person that's  Watching you  Oh  You're just increasing  Your odds  That you're going to be  Fucking  Every block  Increases your odds  Right  40 blocks a day  Each way  That's crazy  In a bad neighborhood  Come on  That's silly  That is crazy  I don't 
[00:30:30]  I don't get  I don't get people  Not being more aware  Of their surroundings  Though  I see a lot of  Let's say  Security cameras  Stuff  I watch it online  And you see  Like somebody's  Walking in a parking garage  And there's someone  Behind them  To their left  And they won't  Turn around  They won't look  They won't stop  There have been times  I've had people  On the sidewalk  Behind me  And I've just  I've moved  To the side  Of the building  To where the building  And the sidewalk is  Put my back  Against the wall  And just waited  For them to pass 
[00:31:00]  That's all  You know what  I'm not crazy  Thinking they're  Going to do  Something to me  But I'm just  Not willing to  Either take the chance  Or why should I  Have to concentrate  On that  And maybe miss  Something else  Right  So I just let them  Pass  Right  And you know  Problem solved  But there are people  That won't even  Notice shit  Going on around them  Right  Victims  They're just waiting  You're absolutely right  Yeah  Alright Mars  Thank you  Mars  Really appreciate it  A very proud day  For your people  Just from you today  A nice accurate translation 
[00:31:30]  Very accurate  A disclaimer about  Spanish people  And the fact that  There are many good  Hispanic people  Yes there are  And you're still though  You're talking about  Their proclivity  To sexual deviance  Proclivity  Very good  Very well rounded  So yesterday  I went to the  Bronx Zoo  And you know  How we were just  Talking about God  Gwad  Isn't that redundant  See what I did there  And we were just  Talking about  Gwad and stuff  Gwad  Word of Gwad 
[00:32:00]  Man you look at  A fucking giraffe  Yeah  This is going to be  Like a water discussion  Hey it's fine  I love these  It's Friday  But you look at  A fucking giraffe  And a rhino  Yeah  Fucking gorilla  Oh  A peacock  Oh  And it's really hard  To believe that  They all just started  On earth  Oh so you're thinking  Perhaps some type  Of alien transplantation  Well now that we're  Realizing that  There's so many  Fucking planets  And fucking galaxies  Yeah yeah 
[00:32:30]  It's endless  Why couldn't there  Just be a planet  That has nothing  But giraffes  Just giraffe planet  It would make more sense  How do you take  Our goop like you say  Yeah  And you goop it up  A little bit  And you do a little  Something something  That's a human  But then you goop it up  And do a little  Something something  That's a giraffe  And it's pretty amazing  It's pretty fucked up  You look at a rhinoceros  It's like what  Impoceros  Right  What the fuck  Why can't there  Why can't there 
[00:33:00]  Just be individual planets  For every single  Thing that's on earth  Giraffes  Ipobotem  But for some weird reason  Through whatever  The big bang  It just kind of  Threw all that shit  All over the place  Oh  Oh I see what you're saying  Yeah  Not like a big ship  Came with giraffes  Steering it  Oh god no  And landing  But in the very early time  Where they just  All the goop went everywhere  From the initial big bang  Right  That there was some goop  From this place  All the goop was nice  And organized  You know what I mean 
[00:33:30]  It was all organized  This goop is  A human planet  Giraffe goop  This is the giraffe goop  And they're gonna live  Over here on this planet  Or whatever the fuck  Right  And then everything  Got mixed up  Big fucking explosion  And then all the goop  Got all mixed up  Well you could look  At things like giraffes  And rhinoceros  And realize how they evolved  And the purpose  They serve  I mean you look  At the giraffe  That's fucking weird  With the big long neck  So he can eat the leaves  That are higher up  Than the grazers  So 
[00:34:00]  On there  So it takes care  And prunes the canopies  Of various jungles  That don't make sense  But why didn't the rhinoceros  Get a big neck  It likes to graze as well  But the rhinoceros  Has a different thing  Where he takes care  Of the lower part  Of the jungle  And keeps everything  In check down there  Don't you think  The giraffe would  Would have loved  To just take care  Of the lower part  Of a jungle  I don't think  He gives a shit  I think it's pretty cool  Why all of a sudden  Did the giraffe  Have to be the one  With the long goofy neck  Everyone's got their jobs  And why is it  The only one  With the long goofy neck 
[00:34:30]  Why are we here  Entertaining people  Exactly  Hugely  It's just our job  Our mission in life  The giraffe  Giraffe  Has to  Eat the shit up top  You don't find it weird  It's one of the only ones  With the big long  Fucking neck  And it's one of the only  Animals that evolved  To have the big  Goofy long neck  He is pretty fucked up  Thank you  That's all I'm saying today  That is pretty fucked up  Do you know the giraffe  And why did Gwad give  The rhinoceros  Such a big  Huge  Heavy head 
[00:35:00]  That big  Giant  Armor plated head  They are  Badass looking though  Oh my god  Rhinos  We have a god guy  We're just fucking around  Brother  You know Larry  We're just fucking around  Relax  God created the earth  We all know  Okay  We good  Oh boy  Well that's fine  I wasn't going to argue  With you or get contentious  And good morning boys  Good morning Larry  Contentious  Who are you Mars  Big words  Well no no  I  You know  I  Sorry  I try to talk rationally 
[00:35:30]  And plainly  Well clearly anyway  About religion  Yeah  Sir  Yes sir  We're listening Larry  We're listening  Do you talk to your friends  Do you talk to your friends  And then in the middle  Of your sentence  You just stop  And look at them  Yeah we're having  A conversation  Let's go  Let a rip  As they say  I've done a phone conversation  Once or twice in my life  I understand how this works  Go ahead  Okay well  Most researchers  Without an agenda  Going in  Understand that  Everything on earth  Was created by 
[00:36:00]  What they call  Intelligent design  Yeah  That evolution  Really only a theory  Has never been proven  Correct  And it really  Can't be proven  Correct  Although  A lot of research  Is trying to prove it  Correct  Can try to  Larry  Let me ask you one question  How old is the earth  About 7,000 years old  Alright that's crazy  Oh  Oh  Poor Larry  Let him call the after show  And fucking  Give Sam all the praise  And accolades  And talk about how 
[00:36:30]  That shitty show  That's on before Sam's show  I've heard Larry before  I've heard Larry  He's one of your guys  I've heard him bad mouth  This very program  He's one of your guys  In order to praise  So you've got the people  That believe that the earth  Is only 7,000 years old  I guess so  I will not even  I will not even  Have conversations  With those people  I'm sorry  It is  Abso-fucking-lutely  Proven  Beyond  Not even a reasonable doubt  Any doubt  Whatsoever  That the earth  Is older 
[00:37:00]  Than 7,000 years  There isn't even  An inkling  Of doubt  In the minds  Of reasonable  Scientific people  That the earth  Is older  Than 7,000 years  You dumb fucks  But here's the problem  Yeah  There are  And they're gonna start  Nodding in their cars  Right now  There are a lot of people  That believe  What Larry just said  It's crazy talk  It's amazing  How many people  Actually believe that  How do you believe  The earth is 7,000 years old  When things that are here 
[00:37:30]  It would be impossible  For them to be here  It would be impossible  Just erosion  On mountains  And rocks  Tell you  That they've been here  Longer than 7,000 years  They have  A way of telling that  Please  So those people  Walk around a museum  And it says  You know  This lived  For 48 million years  Or whatever  Bullshit  They have to just  Walk around  Yelling bullshit  Yeah  They yell bullshit  On everything  On everything  Hold on  Let me say hi to Graham 
[00:38:00]  Is Graham one of your guys  Too there Sam  I don't think so  He's the guy from  The cracker empire  I believe  Yes  Very impressive  Hi Graham  How are you sir  Good  How's it going  Good  Basically  This guy is a complete  You guys know  He's a complete fucking idiot  I know that  But last night  I'm reading an article  That a 4th grade  Intelligence design teacher  Gives their kids a quiz  And the questions  On his quiz  Is shit like  Humans and dinosaurs  Existed at the same time 
[00:38:30]  Right  And the kids circling  True  I get the 100  On the fucking quiz  Yeah yeah yeah  Wow  These intelligent design people  Are so fucking stupid  They literally believe  That all the laws  Of reality  Are not true  It's unbelievable  And here's  And here's the excuse  Here's the excuse  They'll give you  Well all of that stuff  Was put there  To test our faith  The earth is actually  7,000 years old  But all that proof  That shows that it's older 
[00:39:00]  Is there to test us  But now who  Now who the fuck  Is delving into this  Explanation that is  Completely  Fantasy  Right  As opposed to fact  So we're supposed to believe  This guy's faith  Alone  Against scientific  Research  And what they've come up with  I don't think so  But I have faith  People are fucking morons  And they're completely  Ruining  Any chance  That I have  For sanity  Because when I talk 
[00:39:30]  To these  Bafflingly stupid  Idiots  I just want to  Shove a gun  In my mouth  It's unbelievable  How desperate  These people are  To cling  To their religion  When almost  Every aspect of it  Has been proven wrong  And the fucking  Horrible things  That religion  Inspires people  To do  Well yeah  I don't mind  I don't mind  That people  Cling to their religion  But I mean  Basic facts  I will not argue  Anymore in my life  I can't  I can't have a conversation  With someone that thinks  The earth is only 
[00:40:00]  7,000 years old  Right  Right then and there  Conversation fucking done  Earl Douglas  Everything else  Black Earl  Black Earl believes  The earth is 7,000 years old  He's an idiot  So I'd rather just  Discuss music with Earl  I'm not going down  That road with people  I just know  You can't  I know in my soul  That the earth is  Way older than  7,000 years  7,000 years old  How the fuck  Does all that shit  Because they have a belief  That God just  Zapped it into existence  So you're trying to tell me  That the giraffe's neck 
[00:40:30]  It only took 7,000 years  To get all fucking  Long and goofy  That's it  Get out of here  And just  Thank you Graham  It makes no  Graham Parker  No problem  Take care guys  Last name Parker  No no no  I thought we had  A fucking celebrity  On the line  You have various  Levels of evolution  For animals  That you can see  Like you know  Mammoths and mastodons  Things like that  And saber tooth tigers  And then they have  Skeletal remains 
[00:41:00]  And what not  From that  To our modern day  Equivalent of that  And everything in between  During that evolution  And it's a lot longer  Than 7,000 years  This is proof  They have different  Levels and layers  In the earth  Of where they've  Gotten these  Fossils and bones  From  And the layers  Let you know  Exactly when  In earth's history  This happened  How the fuck  Do you discount that  Just by saying  It's a test 
[00:41:30]  What a cop out  What a cop out  Fucking explanation  That is  There's a little more  To it than that  Let me say hi to  John in Westchester  John  Hey  Is John your last name  As in  Elton  No  Fuck  Is your last name  Is your last name  I thought I had a  Celebrity on the line  316  I'm winning  I'm winning  Alright  Regular John  But the problem  With the religious guy  Is he's actually  Going against God  By putting a time period  On his work  Because it says  In the bible 
[00:42:00]  Moses died  At 210 years old  But had the body  Of a 70 year old  Okay  Now if you look  At the  Hold on  Hold on  There was such good  Medical care back then  I used to know  The bible pretty good  I bailed on the bible  Many years ago  It says that  Moses lived to 210  I believe so  They wandered the desert  For 70 years  And the guy was still alive  Still alive  When they left  He was 60 years old  I can't believe  That Moses made it  To 210  I can't believe 
[00:42:30]  That either  I'm sorry  No  Sorry  But that's what  The bible says  And I don't  Believe that either  What I'm trying  To explain is  Like if you look  At time as a mountain  And one year  To us  Is a second  To a mountain  You know  When God created  Yeah it took him  A week to create  The earth  But it took  6500 billion years  To create it  In man's  Timeline  That's  That's the way  It should  Look at  At least that's  What I think 
[00:43:00]  So does Larry  Believe  7000 years  Like we know it  Larry is one  Of those fools  That think  Jesus Christ  Walked around  With a dinosaur  As a pet  Apparently  He's a fucking  Moron  Alright  Thank you  John  Alright  Sorry  I was no help  I'm punching out  No  Nah  You were  You're alright  Fuck  None help  What you're pointing  At someone  What do you need  Hmm  Were you pointing  At someone  No no  I was pointing  At the camera  I was trying  To get some  Oh  Alright  Yeah I don't 
[00:43:30]  Get the  7000 years  And then  And then  Well  It means  Longer  Because it's  7000 years  But there's  Really no  Basis on  God's  Years  God years  In God years  And God day  On the first day  God created  Light  Right  Light was first  Right  Light  Let me say  Hi to  Jimbo  In Pennsylvania  Jimbo  Good morning  Gentlemen  Hello 
[00:44:00]  What's up  With the fact  That it is  Now sitting  There essentially  Bashing everybody  In his  Political party  They're the only  Wackos that think  The earth is 7000  I think there are  More fucking  Republicans  Of course there are  Democrats  That believe  Around 7000 years  But let me tell  You something  My friend  Jimbo  From PA  I don't fall  Into the  Conservative  Religious  Right  Republican  Alright  I don't fall  Into that  So don't say  My party  I think those  Religious  Right  Republicans

[01:09:00]  All right.  We should take a break.  All righty. 
[01:09:30]  Do we have a clear field today, or we got people coming in?  Clear the field.  We got Bob Saget calling in at 930.  Okay, and that's about it.  All right.  Is it a theme today?  Yeah.  Any rolling shenanigans today?  Any themes today?  I don't think so.  Not yet.  It's not to say there won't be.  You got a voice thing, too?  Oh, yeah.  Did we make out?  We could.  Now.  No, did we?  Now that I remember.  So you got this shit, so I got it from you?  No, my dad.  I was on the phone with him yesterday, and he's convinced he was hanging around with your  kid that did this to me. 
[01:10:00]  Whoa.  Hey.  Easy there.  Oh, that's what your dad thinks, does he?  Uh-huh.  Jesus Christ.  It's not Typhoid Mary over there.  That's what he thinks.  So he's saying, my dad's going to call his dad.  He said, why is my son hanging out with your son?  Oh, boy.  That's a very good question.  We could end that right here.  Yeah.  No problem.  No problem with that.  Yeah.  Your voice sounds more robust.  You have an audition for EW.  You might get it this time, yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Do you really?  Huh?  They're giving you a thing?  Oh, just because your voice is different.  No, no, no.  Because I got a new voice now.  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Little joke.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  Little humor.  When's the podcast start?  A lot of people are asking me.  I'm asking us, I should say.  The plan is to launch it next week.  Next Wednesday.  We're thinking Wednesday.  It's on the fast track?  It's on the fast track?  Fast track?  Yeah.  Front burner?  Yeah.  I got a demo today of what the podcast is going to sound like, and me and Ann went through  it.  And look, man, I really do try, but just the stupidity continues. 
[01:11:00]  You think so?  Yeah.  They're teasing.  They have teases during the podcast, what's coming up.  Look, I can't even jump on this bandwagon here, because I got to put it this way.  It's something brand new.  They weren't sure.  If they kept doing it after we say something, then I would say, yeah, they're stupid.  Right now, it's just something new.  So I'll give them a pass.  But these guys have never downloaded a podcast?  If you download the podcast, you have already committed. 
[01:11:30]  They got radio mentality, though.  You got to get them out of radio mentality.  I've never heard a podcast like Rogan or any of these other guys where it says, and coming  up.  Coming up?  No, there's no coming up when you do a podcast.  They download it.  No need to tease.  E-Rock?  Rogan doesn't even do an intro anymore.  No.  It just turns on, and he's in the middle of a read or he's talking to somebody.  You want to get right to your podcast thing.  Of course.  But with that said, we're very excited. 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Coming up hard.  No, of course not.  Maybe a quick intro this week on the ONA podcast.  Boom, boom, and boom, and then boom, we get into it.  Maybe just have you guys do the intros.  Nice, clean, basic.  Sure.  I kind of like that.  Sure.  Little new exclusive material.  Adds a personal touch.  Exactly.  We're excited.  It'll be about an hour.  We could go a little more than an hour every week.  We'll see.  We'll see what makes sense. 
[01:12:30]  I just know when I'm downloading podcasts and listening to podcasts, more than an hour,  I get kind of annoyed.  You get a little annoyed?  A little bit.  Yeah, an hour is really it.  Except that I'm not just saying this, except for Rogan.  But anyone else, if they're moving past an hour, I get annoyed.  It gets a little annoying.  Yeah.  A quick hour is nice, because then I can move on to someone else's quick hour.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That seems about the right length.  Yeah, an hour is good.  An hour is good, right?  Yeah.  It seems to be working for a lot of people. 
[01:13:00]  What do you got, Mars?  I found it, but I need to find it on your computer.  The gorilla saving the kid.  Oh, really?  Wait, you found it out there, but you can't find it in here?  Yeah, for some reason.  I don't know why.  He's looking up Meta Cafe on YouTube.  Wait, wait.  What?  Was your memory erased within 15 feet?  He found it out there, but he can't find it in...  What?  For some reason, I...  What happened?  Wait, where did you find it? 
[01:13:30]  It was on Met Cafe.  On another computer?  Met Cafe.  And how long ago was that?  About 10 minutes ago.  Five minutes ago.  Oh, boy.  I'll get it.  Is Met Cafe a YouTube channel?  No.  Then why are you on YouTube?  What?  Oh, my God.  You're putting it into the YouTube search.  Yeah, I know, because it's there, too.  But how do you know?  No, it's not.  It's not. 
[01:14:00]  It's apparently not there.  Oh, no.  He closed out the browser.  He's starting over in the Google search.  He found the video.  Yeah.  Five minutes ago out there, and now he's in here.  Just lost.  And now he can't find it.  Lost.  Okay.  All right.  There he is right there.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Well, now I don't want to see this now.  Okay.  All right.  Of course we've got to.  It's the report.  So it's the reporter talking to a zoo official.  There it is.  When the three-year-old boy first fell into the animal's den.  Poor kid. 
[01:14:30]  His first impulse was to help.  First thing I want to do is to help right away.  As we're trying to get to a scene, you know, and actually go in and, you know, mitigate the situation right away.  Worst audio ever.  And do as much as we can.  But that was probably the worst part is not being able to do that.  Now it's over here.  Oh, man.  In the video, in it, you can see the gorilla, Benti Wah, holding and comforting the three-year-old.  She soon takes the little boy to the habitat door.  And that's where paramedic Jeff Bruno and others rushed in for the rescue.  It seems like it's a... 
[01:15:00]  They sure don't know how to carry kids.  Just holding around the belly.  Just kind of...  All right.  Dropped it off at the door.  Big deal.  Big deal.  Big deal.  Stupid thing.  Why don't you take him to the hospital?  Exactly.  All right.  So podcast, hopefully we'll start uploading every Wednesday.  Yeah.  That's exciting.  Where are we going?  We're going to iTunes.  We'll be all over.  iTunes, Stitcher.  Where else?  We're going to take this thing.  Wherever the people need it. 
[01:15:30]  We're set up like a little RSS feed.  What?  Now you're just talking crazy computer talk.  I know.  But people will be able to put it on any phone, wherever.  How many downloads do you think we could get a week?  10 or 12, probably.  I was thinking, I told Rob Cross, we could get 30 downloads a week.  30 would be nice.  Yeah, it would be really, really nice.  It's right on the charts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk about some other shit.  Stay there.  The OPSA Show.  Yes, yes, I remember.  I had lasagna. 
[01:16:00]  Great choice today, E-Rock.  Great choice.  Rattle and hump.  Hey.  Did it.  Dang.  An underappreciated CD, Rattle and hump.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Really?  I think so.  I thought a lot of people dug it.  Eh, not so much.  Not as much as the other ones.  Oh, yeah.  Like the Joshua Tree.  That's the biggie. 
[01:16:30]  Bono's 53 today.  53 for the Bono?  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah, Rattle and hump has a lot of great songs on it.  I'll talk about the originals, by the way.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Of course.  I have definitely acquired more of an appreciation for Bono's voice over the years.  Really?  Yeah, he's got a pretty good goddamn voice on him. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I love the Bono.  I love the U2.  I was blinded by my hatred of his, yes, the light.  I was blinded by my hatred of his political bullshit and all of his crap when he was younger,  you know?  All that shit.  I was just like, fuck you.  And then you realized that he was right.  Yeah.  Yes.  I realized.  That you have a lot in common with Bono.  Well, we've talked about it.  I fucking hate when my rock stars have to fucking babble in between songs. 
[01:17:30]  Because, you know, you just think in your head what song they could have been playing  in that spot.  Yeah.  I mean, a little is all right, I guess, but.  Well, you know.  A little goes a long way, right?  It really does.  You can't be just pontificating up on the stage like Bruce.  There's long stories.  Oh, Jesus.  He is amazing.  Yeah, on the Jersey Shore.  Oh, right.  Here you go.  And it's just like they're noodling and riffing in the background. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  And then when I was seven, oh, God, it's in real time.  Have you ever seen Springsteen Live?  Yeah.  Over at.  I fucking went, what, about a year ago now.  I fucking loved it.  Oh, yeah.  You saw him at the Apollo.  It was fucking good.  He knows how to perform, I think.  But, wow.  Just.  All right, Bruce.  We get it.  You're born and raised in Jersey.  You love the Jersey Shore.  You love talking about your younger days with the chicks in Jersey. 
[01:18:30]  Just play the fucking songs and shut up.  He's a billionaire.  He certainly is.  Is he a billionaire?  He's got to be close.  Bruce Springsteen.  Bruce has to be close.  You got it.  You think?  To a billionaire.  Yes.  He has 1.62 billion.  Roland loves pointing out the prices that he charges for tickets around the world and what  he makes on tour.  He makes a shitload.  Yeah.  Well, celebrity net worth isn't worth their fucking, uh, is it worth the ink they're, 
[01:19:00]  oh, wait a minute.  Is it worth the paper they owe?  He's only worth 200 million.  There's no way.  That number's got to be way higher for Bruce Springsteen.  Look at my net worth.  What do they have my net worth at?  15.  15 mil?  Jeez, really?  Fucking nice.  Fucking A, man.  Oh, jeez.  That's great.  Look at the picture.  I think that was from the Paul McCartney show.  That girl.  That was such a weird relationship with that girl.  I don't know what happened.  She had a boyfriend.  I had a girlfriend.  And you guys...  It was meant to happen.  And then you guys went to a public event together? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty fucked up.  Well, I didn't...  What's my net worth?  Oh, yours is more.  Why is mine more?  I don't know.  They can save money forever.  I think they figured...  How is mine more?  That you made more...  Because you were in radio longer.  Nice.  You made an extra five mil.  Nice.  You made an extra five mil at BAB.  God damn.  At BAB, you made an extra five mil at all.  Nice.  I made five million at BAB.  That was great.  Worth 20 mil, huh?  20 million dollars. 
[01:20:00]  I better start fucking dressing like I...  Damn.  I'm worth that much.  Damn.  Nice beard.  Yeah.  God damn.  I gotta grow that...  What's that fucking girl's name?  I gotta grow that beard back.  You don't remember her name?  Susie Wong.  Susie Wang.  Tommy Wang.  Fucking Charlie Chan.  Wait, so you had a girlfriend and she had a boyfriend?  Lexi, Lexi, Lexi.  You had a girlfriend.  She had a boyfriend.  Yeah.  And you take her to a big over-the-top event with a shitload of fucking paparazzi. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Well, wait a minute.  I had just started going out with the wonderful Melissa Stetton at the time.  Okay.  Supermodel.  Melissa Stetton, as they call her on certain websites, I guess.  And so it was kind of like, I think I could get one more date in before I actually commit  up to this thing.  Right.  You know?  But had you committed up? 
[01:21:00]  I'm not sure.  It was in that gray area.  Really?  It was in that gray area.  But I think if we asked...  We didn't deny that.  Okay.  I was going to say, if we asked her...  Right.  It was not a gray area.  And did you say, I'm just going to bring this girl because we're not really committed  yet?  Or were you like, I'm going alone.  Don't even worry about it.  I didn't say anything.  But I did find out that during a certain gray area, when we were, you know, she was  flying to New York so we could hang out.  We were kind of establishing something.  Gray area.  When she went back to L.A. once, fucked her ex-boyfriend. 
[01:21:30]  So...  When did you learn that?  I don't know.  It was kind of at some point.  I don't know.  So, this girl, Lexi, who I thought, you know, a very pretty girl and stuff like that.  Like, we kind of got together and she didn't say anything about a boyfriend.  Where'd you guys meet?  It might have been that wonderful vehicle called Facebook.  Facebook.  Or something.  And when you saw the paparazzi taking pictures and stuff, like, Getty Image was there. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  See, it looks on your face like you're like, well, fuck it.  Let's make the most of it.  Yeah, what...  Like, I'm all in then.  Like, I was with my wife and I didn't stop for those fucking vultures.  It's a gray area.  I actually went in a side door.  I'm like, I don't want to deal with that shit.  I was in the gray...  You stop.  Look, you're all ready.  I'm so...  This is my date.  I couldn't be more proud.  Nothing to hide.  When you were absolutely in gray area material.  It was a gray area. 
[01:22:30]  Gray area.  All right.  I was in that gray zone of fucking relationship.  They use that picture a lot, too, that one.  They do.  It's a great pic, isn't it?  That one pops up a lot.  Look at us.  We're just a fucking power couple out on the town.  Did you have to explain the picture?  Yes.  I got a lot of heat for the picture.  You did?  A lot of heat for the picture.  What kind of heat?  I think I got, like, things thrown at me.  But nothing...  Melissa...  The lovely and talented Melissa Stetton was always good at picking up an object and heaving 
[01:23:00]  it at your buddy Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, she was a heaver.  Could she throw anything?  What kind of things were heaved at you?  Can we guess?  Give it a guess.  All right.  Make a list, Sam.  Okay.  All right.  Things that were heaved at me.  How many...  From Melissa Stetton.  How many things?  Dude, I can't count.  Oh, good.  Okay.  I'm going to go...  I'm going to go easy.  I'm going to go beer bottle slash wine bottle. 
[01:23:30]  Yes.  Yes.  I was once at the receiving end of a beer bottle being thrown at me.  How about, like, any food products, like a sandwich or something?  No, that's too vague.  No, because you want to see, like, the idea of, like, a sandwich falling apart as it hits Anthony.  That's, like, funny.  By the way, if anyone's wondering...  No, no food.  I got this shitty fucking voice from Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts got me sick.  He came in here fucking sick.  And I got this wonderful voice from Opie Fears. 
[01:24:00]  Ah!  See how that works?  No.  All right.  No food.  All right.  I'm going to go with a...  iPhone!  Yes, multiple times I've had my various phones thrown at me.  I want to keep my streak alive, so I've got to be very careful right here.  Yeah, yeah.  How about a hairbrush?  Hairbrush! 
[01:24:30]  Yes, I have had hairbrushes thrown at me by Stetton.  Yes.  Yes.  Let's see here.  See here.  Ah.  Shit.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Ah!  Ah!  Huh?  Remote control.  Oh, yeah!  Three for three.  The remote control from the TV did take flight.  I'm going very safe right now.  Yes, you are.  Three for three.  I'll take some of the risks.  How about, like, an empty bucket or a pail? 
[01:25:00]  No.  Do you think it'd be funny to watch somebody throw a bucket?  It would be funny.  And there is, indeed, a bucket in the slop sink in the laundry room.  So it wouldn't be out of the question that perhaps she would have found something in the laundry room, a pair of panties, a brassiere, gotten angry with me, picked up a bucket, and thrown it at me.  This did not happen.  Okay.  I'm going to go with another safe one.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  A glass.  A glass.  Yes!  Yeah!  Four for four!  I did have a glass thrown at me. 
[01:25:30]  It did hit the back of the couch.  Okay.  And did not break.  That was in the living room.  Is there still more possibilities?  Oh, yeah.  Because I don't want my streak to get.  Oh, there's four for four.  I'll keep up with the crazy ones.  Uh-huh.  A chair.  No.  Okay.  That's pretty big.  Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  That's a big one.  And that's a hint right there.  It was never anything as large as a chair.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're playing along at home here. 
[01:26:00]  Ninja stars.  No.  No.  Live grenade.  Live grenade.  No.  No.  Yeah.  Racial epithets.  Ah, you know.  Ah, this is.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm going to keep my streak alive.  I'm hoping.  Uh-huh.  A shoe.  Oh, come on.  All right.  I'm five for five.  Of course.  A shoe.  I'm five for five.  A shoe.  Yes.  Okay.  Keys.  Yes.  Yes.  Keys.  All right.  I did have keys.  Is there a wild one in there?  You're not going anywhere. 
[01:26:30]  Karen.  Is there a wild one in there?  A wild one.  Like something you would just never think.  Something you would never think.  Something expensive.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  There was.  Yes.  Yes.  Something.  All right.  More expensive than the iPhone.  Uh, probably on.  On par.  On par.  With.  No, I don't take my guess.  Okay.  This could wreck my streak, but I'm going to go with it.  Uh-huh.  An iPad.  It ruins the streak.  Sorry.  Sorry. 
[01:27:00]  Sorry.  Oh.  Fuck.  Never had the iPad thrown at me.  No.  But, uh, there was a camera.  A video camera or a stove?  A video camera.  Yeah.  It was thrown at me.  Play the spaghetti's coming in.  Play the spaghetti.  No.  Play the spaghetti.  What about a, um, the remains of an abortion?  Thank God.  No.  Um, uh, Ange, uh, checking in.  Yeah.  Of course.  My, uh, my personal assistant.  Ange.  Uh, Melinda throwing the glass at you in the hot tub trumps, um, Melissa's objects. 
[01:27:30]  Wow.  Why?  It is true.  Why?  Well, the danger factor of a glass being thrown in the jacuzzi.  True.  Is very high.  Wait, meaning you're only a few feet away?  Yes.  I was on one side of the jacuzzi.  Melinda was on the other side.  And she picked up a glass and threw it right at my face.  I pulled a superhero move.  In that short period of time, lifted my hand up.  Fook!  Just grabbed the glass in midair. 
[01:28:00]  No way.  Nice.  And, and summarily threw her out of the jacuzzi and my house.  So fucking badass.  Well, she talked about it.  Crazy.  She talked about that on our show, right?  Yeah, yeah.  We've since, you know.  She was a little like, uh, she felt like she was in a weird gray area and thinking that  she was falling for you again a little bit, right?  It was, uh, yeah.  It was very odd.  She, um, she, uh.  She, uh.  It was very weird, uh, for Melinda.  She was insane.  Yes, yes.  Very strange.  Very, uh, quite a reach.  Quite a reach.  It's that goddamn Kumia charm. 
[01:28:30]  Ah, it must be.  What else has been thrown at you?  And how many of the items hit you?  Huh?  How many of them hit you?  Like, there's a lot that you avoided or that you caught.  Let me tell you something.  The only one that actually hit me was the first thing that was ever thrown at me by her.  The beer.  And then I was onto it.  The beer bottle.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't.  iPhone was the first thing that was thrown at me.  Because the iPhone was the reason that I got something thrown at me.  Anthony was very trusting and had no code on his iPhone. 
[01:29:00]  Uh, he was at a hotel room in, uh, Manhattan with, uh, uh, Melissa Stetton.  The wonderful supermodel, as they say on websites.  And, um, uh, uh, uh, I left my phone out on the, on the night table.  As I went in to take a little shower.  And, uh, and my shower was interrupted.  Mind you.  Thank God I wasn't in the shower still.  I was drying off.  But nude.  No, no.  I had a towel around me.  Wow.  And, uh, the door flings open and I hear, 
[01:29:30]  You motherfucking piece of shit!  As the phone came flying in at me.  Wow.  Where did it hit you?  It hit me square in the side of the head.  Oh my God.  Really?  Yeah.  And then it tumbled to the floor.  Broken iPhone?  And, and cracked, yeah.  Yeah.  And then I'm like, you know, you get that Rolodex of what did I do?  Going through my head.  I'm like, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  The phone.  You don't want to fess up to anything yet because you can't fess up to what she hasn't  fett out about. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  Well, she had taken a peek at, um, my phone.  She took a little look-see.  Perhaps saw some.  Anthony Kumiya, very trusting not to be trusted.  You did.  You know what?  Don't go through my shit.  Right.  That's what I say.  Right.  Don't go through my shit.  Right.  And you fucking, uh, and you fucking, uh, you fucking, uh, fucked your boyfriend.  Right.  Your ex-boyfriend.  Wow.  You threw that right back at her.  Hey, you know, you gotta do that. 
[01:30:30]  You gotta do what you gotta do.  You gotta do that.  What else makes-  What else makes the list?  Perhaps there was some fondling going on in the jacuzzi with a certain fucking guy from  a television show.  No.  What television show?  I'm not saying.  In your jacuzzi.  I'm not even speculating.  I'm not even going off on that.  My jacuzzi.  Right, right, right.  The, uh, TV showdown.  Oh.  How about I can guess the TV show?  I won't.  Perhaps this was going on.  In your house?  Uh-huh.  No. 
[01:31:00]  No way.  A very drunken night.  No way.  Oh, yeah.  There's been accusations that were going on about that.  Why don't you just ask?  Oh, I did.  And what?  That made a giant, as they say, a boudel.  That was a giant, big blowout thing of accusations, denials, witnesses.  No, you asked her.  Yeah.  Why don't you ask him?  I did.  And what did he say?  I didn't know.  There was never any recollection of anything. 
[01:31:30]  And everything was drunk and vague.  Where were you?  I was probably fucking tongue in some whore that was over my house in the basement.  Oh, my God.  No, I have no idea.  I wasn't there.  Where did you get to the point where the allegations started?  Actually, later in that evening, when a couple of key witnesses said they saw things that  were a little shady going on in the jacuzzi.  And I'm like, what?  Didn't you check your security cameras?  I tried, but they weren't focused on that. 
[01:32:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  Ah.  Yeah.  And how's your relationship with this guy?  Oh, it's fine.  Because I don't give a shit.  Right.  After that point.  But there was a denial.  Not total denial.  There was a Reagan testimony.  I don't recall.  I don't recall.  Yes.  I don't recall.  There was a lot of drinking.  Right.  Believe me.  A lot of drinking.  And yeah, yeah.  Right under your nose.  But right after that event. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  Anthony entered this renaissance, this new phase of, I don't give a shit.  Right.  All fucks were forgotten.  And I just fucking, I put, I got a Naughty Boy phone.  I put a fucking block on it.  I used to hide my Naughty Boy phone under my mattress on my side of the bed.  And I was texting, DMing fucking everything you could do with every girl I could possibly  fucking find.  Because of this allegation? 
[01:33:00]  That was a big part of it.  That started it?  That was a big part of it.  How early on was this allegation?  Eh, it was about halfway through the whole thing.  Halfway through the whole thing?  The whole deal.  The whole deal.  And then, yeah, then it just, like, I'd given up on the relationship.  But it was one of those things where it's kind of hard to instantly get out of.  Yeah.  And I tried, if you recall, remember the stories, she was out of the house.  Living in my apartment in Manhattan.  Right.  But out of the house.  And she moved over to L.A. 
[01:33:30]  And, you know, that's that.  And you guys are good now, right?  There's still little snippy things going back and forth.  But nothing, you know.  Nothing too major.  Nothing too bad.  There's an occasional text of, like, oh, did you see that?  Or did you see this?  Right.  Anything.  But, yeah, I don't hold any grudges.  Why would I?  Two sides to every story, indeed.  Well, let's finish our list, though.  So far, things thrown at Anthony in this relationship was a beer bottle, an iPhone, a hairbrush, a remote control, drinking glass, shoe, keys, video camera. 
[01:34:00]  Anything else to add to that list?  Uh, yeah, there was, um, trying to think.  Had to be some kind of food.  How long was the relationship?  Never food.  Relationship was probably, eh, your standard year.  Relationship year.  Five, six, seven, eight.  So you're looking at something getting thrown at you almost monthly.  Yes.  Okay.  It was usually a monthly thing.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  So did you have a pumpkin thrown at you? 
[01:34:30]  Any holiday things thrown at you?  A cornucopia.  A cornucopia.  A Christmas ball.  A fucking M80.  A turkey leg.  An Easter egg.  Right.  A handful of candy corn.  A flag for Flag Day.  Anything?  Anything else to add to the list?  Yeah, I'm trying to think of things that were around the, yeah, I'm kind of drawing a blank now.  There were probably a couple of other stray items, but nothing really of note.  Okay. 
[01:35:00]  Anything, you know, she could get her hands on during a moment of anger, I guess.  So I almost was perfect.  Yeah, you came close.  Except for that iPad.  I had to go iPad.  A little overzealous.  I had to go iPad.  I was thinking like a Frisbee toss.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  I hear you.  Oh, well.  Yeah, so, yeah, but that Lexi girl, that's what we got.  That Lexi girl from the Paul McCartney concert was one of those things where I was like,  you know what?  As a matter of fact, the reason I didn't take Melissa Stetton, she was out of town. 
[01:35:30]  What am I going to do?  Go fucking solo?  It was the big Paul McCartney night.  I'm going to go solo to Paul McCartney, or I'm going to take the likes of fucking Travis  Teft or Sam Roberts?  No.  I don't think so.  I got Getty fucking photos there.  I need a little arm candy.  Right?  The media would think you were a queeb.  Or a quay.  Or a quay, right.  Right.  Not me, motherfucker.  So, and then, the fucking turnabout is fair play, there was some kind of Facebook scandal 
[01:36:00]  where all of a sudden, I get this big fucking Facebook thing from her boyfriend.  Uh-oh.  Saying, hey, dude, you're fucking going out with my girlfriend.  Jesus.  We're going out.  We're boyfriend and girlfriend, you fuck.  You really didn't know?  Not a clue.  He was pissed?  He was fucking pissed.  So, she's in a fucking, like, the media's got our pictures out there.  But she's in a solid relationship.  Apparently so. 
[01:36:30]  So, this guy thought.  So, this guy thought.  And even if it's not, you don't want to go in there with a guy in a relationship.  So, wait, wait, wait.  It's nothing but trouble.  Let's break this down.  You go to Paul McCartney with her.  Yeah.  The pictures are taken, and they're splashed everywhere.  And then he finds out.  So, then he gets a hold of you?  Yeah.  He wrote some big Facebook post-y thing.  To you directly?  That's just it.  I wasn't really going on Facebook much at that point.  So, I didn't really see it. 
[01:37:00]  But other people did, and they copy-pasted it.  And said, what is this going on?  What the fuck?  Can we find it?  Good luck.  What did he say?  He was just like, hey, it's my chick.  We're going out.  What are you doing?  Right.  He's like, oh, you know, I can't compete with that.  Oh, he's all bummed out?  It's absolutely the truth.  I mean, really.  Think about it, people.  Jesus.  That's the way to win the heart of his girl back?  I can't compete with that.  So, did he say sorry?  I don't think I said anything. 
[01:37:30]  I think she actually texted me after that and was like, hey, sorry about this whole thing.  Ah, what are you going to do?  I got me one of them boyfriends.  And I was like, all right.  Was she hoping that you were going to be her boyfriend?  I don't know.  I don't know.  She was cool.  You know, nice, fun kind of a thing.  But good looking. 
[01:38:00]  What are you going to do?  Yeah, yeah.  She was very attractive.  One of those whirlwind gray area romances.  Pshh.  So he goes, uh-oh.  It's a high-pitched Anthony voice.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  She, I don't know.  I was not calling on.  Drinking, shipping, cocktails high in the Sierra Mountains.  So now we know the story.  Yeah, that's what happened to Lexi.  I don't know.  Whatever happened.  I don't know.  You know, what happened happened to her. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  But apparently, you know, she went back to this dude.  And that was the last hide in her hair anyone ever heard from her.  Right.  As far as, you know, radio personality goes.  Dr. Steve says I should be on Singular.  Is that OTC or what?  Ah.  Is that some OTC shit?  I know it's a phone service.  I wouldn't switch, though.  No, you wouldn't.  I don't know what his.  It's not his business what phone service you use.  That's true.  I know that much.  Good point, sir.  Good point. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Singular OTC, do we know?  Ah.  Why don't you get one of the bitches that walk around this joint to go down to the fucking  pharmacy and pick you up some of that.  Yeah.  You need to be taking your Singular.  Is this Alan Thicke Jr.'s last day?  Yeah, it is.  Oh, what a shame.  You gonna miss him?  Yesterday.  What happened yesterday?  He just was...  I saw that you talked to Alan Hunter.  Was he a little wordy?  Oh, Alan Hunter?  I need to know.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little wordy, right?  But you know what? 
[01:39:30]  All good-natured.  All good-natured talking.  Good stories.  A lot of fun.  He likes to talk about the 80s.  Boy, he loves it.  It was his big...  We did find out, also, that chicks, obviously, were throwing themselves at those guys.  The MTV of...  Even Alan Hunter?  Even Alan Hunter.  Really?  He was married during the whole thing and got divorced after.  So he's got that same...  Ah.  He's got that same thing we did when we were going out.  You were going out with your girlfriend.  I was married to my dumb wife. 
[01:40:00]  And...  The shit we could have...  The shit we could have done that we didn't do.  Oh, my God.  That you'd later look back on and go, but I got divorced anyway, so I could have done that.  I know.  It wouldn't have mattered in the end anyway.  Ah.  I will never, ever, ever...  We had the bitches throwing themselves at us.  I will never, ever...  Don't...  Live down...  Don't go there.  The skinny dipping that we didn't do.  Don't go there.  They wanted to go skinny dipping with us.  They were the Kahlua girls.  They were the girls they sent to bars in the tight little fucking one tube dress. 
[01:40:30]  You know, the tube dress with, like, Kahlua logos on it?  And they walk around and give the people Kahlua?  Those booze girls, they have one prerequisite.  Hot!  I didn't...  Be hot!  I didn't know how we were going to explain the smell of seaweed when we got home.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they wanted to go to some lake and we were all going to fucking just rip our clothes off and go swimming.  Right.  How do we explain the smell of pond scum on our bodies?  But instead of that, here's what I got.  Door shuts.  Where the fuck were you? 
[01:41:00]  I remember...  And I'm just like, oh my god, I could have been skinny dipping with fucking beautiful girls.  I remember we...  That's when we used to drive around a lot together.  Oh, yeah.  And I remember the ride home was very quiet.  Somber, if you will, Opie.  Very quiet.  It was a somber ride home.  Because we were at a crossroads that night.  Oh, were we ever.  We would have fucked it all up, though.  They kept us focused on our skyrocketing radio career.  I guess it did. 
[01:41:30]  Because I think if we went skinny dipping that day, oh boy.  All bets would have been off.  I don't think you'd be listening to Opie and Anthony right now.  We'd have blown up a lot sooner.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  That was...  We were...  They were so hot.  So I just...  I just...  I just figured I'd make out with one of the girls behind the fucking Kalua sign.  Oh, you might have done that.  One of those big stretch banner things that they hang up.  So I just went behind one and was like, yeah, let's fucking, you know, just fool around  a little bit.  And then I went home to that fucking bitch. 
[01:42:00]  And then in the end, it didn't matter.  And then at the end, it didn't matter.  We should have went skinny dipping.  Could have just went skinny dipping.  Could have fucking been plowing away in some open field.  Our advice today is...  Right.  If you have the chance to go skinny dipping, you might as well.  Here's what it is.  You might as well.  If you want to do it.  If there's any inkling in your head that your relationship is not going to work out at  the end, you might as well just fucking go skinny dipping.  Here's what it is.  If you want to do it, if you want to do it, obviously there's a problem with your marriage. 
[01:42:30]  So if you want to do it, do it.  Because the marriage is doomed anyway.  And you're going to have nothing but regrets.  We were so sad.  Oh, it was the saddest drive home.  I believe we were listening to Stars by Home.  Oh.  Or I dropped you off and that's what I was listening to on the way home.  Because I remember for some reason that song was on the radio.  Oh.  There was no part of you guys that was like, wow, you know, that's a bummer, but we're  going home to these great ladies.  No.  No, I never stopped. 
[01:43:00]  Wow.  I never stopped thinking about the skinny dipping.  No, that didn't happen.  I went home.  What could have been?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  To this day, it's never gone away from me.  That is a regret.  A life's regret that you carry with you always is that I didn't go to that lake and we didn't  partake in those ladies.  Maybe they were serial killers.  Maybe we saved our lives that night.  Hey.  Maybe it was a big setup.  Big setup?  Yeah, maybe they had big, huge fucking country boyfriends. 
[01:43:30]  Well, they didn't do it.  They still trying to set us up when they showed up at Ebeneezer's that one night later on and  I saw, hung out and talked with.  I don't remember the Ebeneezer's.  Oh, you weren't there that night.  Oh, I wasn't there.  My bitchy wife was though and I was trying to get away from her long enough to have a  chit chat.  Oh, with the?  With the Kahlua girl.  Nice.  Weren't they Budweiser girls?  No, I think they were Kahlua girls.  You sure?  Yeah.  Because they had Budweiser girls there too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think we had a combination. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, God.  That's what the 90s were all about.  And it wasn't.  Bars and fucking drink girls in tube dresses.  And it wasn't just two girls.  No, there were like four.  It was a pack of girls that said, we're going skinny dipping.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you guys in?  And we had a look at them and go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  We didn't have to be anywhere until 3 p.m. the next afternoon.  God damn it.  In the end, your pals, Opie and Anthony, were good guys. 
[01:44:30]  Club Cadillac.  Club Cadillac.  We were right on, yes.  Club Cadillac.  And we fucking pussied out.  Fuck.  We looked like Mr. Queeb and Mr. Quay when we drove away in your vehicle, looking at the  girls waving in the rearview mirror.  Oh, my God.  All right, we'll just pick up some other fucking undeserving dudes.  Yeah, they don't even care.  They'll just find other dudes, because that's what their lives were all about, skinny dipping  with dudes.  Booze and skinny dipping.  No, I didn't go fuck.  Like grabbing the bottom of that tube dress and just doing the ass shake thing as they 
[01:45:00]  pull it down.  Right.  We'd have just been there, seen it, and been like, yeah.  But then they got to pull out of those dresses to jump in the pond.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, it's fucking back with the wife with a pair of ripped panties and a fucking sports  bra on to go to sleep with.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  They're just like, well, those two are getting back in the homo-mobile, I guess.  We'll just find another couple of guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's find some guys that, you know. 
[01:45:30]  That's what they probably said to each other.  Find some guys that are, you know, heterosexual, that want to go with four or five young fucking  girls to the lake to go skinny dipping.  Iraq, does this story ever get old?  Because I know we've done this one many times.  No, because a little more gets revealed each time.  Well, what's being revealed this time?  Well, I don't know.  This could have been the soundtrack that night.  Oh, man.  Fuck. 
[01:46:00]  Imagine that.  The fucking, the, the, the, your vehicle's parked there.  The doors are open.  All right.  A little music playing.  The girls get out.  They're like, they're just giggling as they're, they're holding their heels and walking down  to the lake side, right?  And then they just, woo!  They make, woo!  Sounds.  And they just peel like bananas.  They peel those little tube dresses off.  Oh, Jesus.  As they step over them.  Ooh.  And then they step in.  Ooh, it's a little cold.  Oh, God.  And I'm just jacking off, coming all over the fucking car. 
[01:46:30]  I would have forced mine to do laps, get a good workout in.  Yeah, I'm going to do some laps around the lake.  You with me?  Come on, ladies.  Around.  Damn.  Wait, how does that sound?  Around the lake.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh.  Awesome Kingdom.  No, I know.  What's the line?  Cody's.  Around the lake tonight.  All right.  Around the lake tonight.  Around the lake.  By my side. 
[01:47:00]  We could play that into break.  Oh, this would have been it.  Where's Possum Kingdom?  Yeah.  We had a lot of opportunities up there.  Oh, dude.  This was it.  Make up your mind.  Yeah, boy, does that speak volume.  Yeah.  Your mind.  Yeah, make up your mind.  Well, we did make up our minds.  Decide to walk with me.  Ah, see?  We're trying.  Around the lake tonight. 
[01:47:30]  No, sorry.  By my side.  Around the lake tonight.  By my side.  No, sorry.  I got to go home.  We got to go homo.  I mean home.  We had nothing to lose.  We had no money.  We had no houses.  We were leasing cars.  There's nothing going on.  Nothing.  And the worst thing, if mine got mad, she would have just went home, which would have  meant more of the bitches. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, more of the bitches.  So how were we losing in that situation?  If we went home smelling like pond scum, all hell would break loose.  It would be a nightmare of a night.  But the next morning, you'd see the car just fucking taking off back to Long Island.  There had no roots up there.  None.  You'd trade in one.  You'd have one horrible night.  Horrible night.  And then we'd have all the fucking skinny dipping we could get our hands on.  Oh, I got another regret. 
[01:48:30]  Rock bus.  Naked girls.  Sharpie.  Fuck.  God damn, that one too.  In the back of the rock bus, which is a motorhome.  In the back of the rock bus was like where they kept the equipment.  And it was technically the bedroom.  Could have done things there too.  And you didn't.  No.  Not really.  A little bit.  You should have done more.  Could have been fondling.  Not really.  Could have been some fondling. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  They didn't even get to fondle?  Oh.  Might have got a lap dance or two back there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  To this day, those could be the greatest pair of tits I've ever seen in my life.  Absolutely.  Oh, fuck.  You didn't get to.  Didn't we ever do headstands?  Oh, yeah.  We had her doing everything.  Yeah, yeah.  Yep.  Jesus Christ.  Until it was time to go home.  Boys will be boys.  There was always the, it's time to go home.  Yeah, time to go home.  Fucking home.  Okay, it's about to get really fun. 
[01:49:30]  We better cut this off now.  Oh, but I couldn't go home.  I had to go to the mother-in-law's house to watch Friends.  Soap operas.  And soap operas in the basement with my mother-in-law and my wife.  So that was so much better.  Yeah.  No, I had the, it's time to go home, and had the, it's time to almost go home.  Yeah.  Right.  Because he had to always stop off at his mother-in-law's first.  You have to go watch your mother-in-law's stories.  For two hours.  Yes.  It was about two hours every night.  At least two hours of programming. 
[01:50:00]  That was the mother-in-law and the wife sitting there watching, and me just having to, having  to watch, because there was no other TV in the house.  That was the only one downstairs.  So I'd just sit there, but the first thing I would do is find the most giant glass in  the house.  Sometimes I would use a vase, and fill it up with Captain Morgan and Coke.  Right.  And just sit there.  Clink, clink, clink.  Clink, clink, clink.  Just trying to get as hammered as I could as quickly as possible. 
[01:50:30]  And numb the pain of knowing that there was other girls somewhere that I could have been  having sexual intercourse with.  I had another one that really pushed forward.  Oh, yeah?  One of the girls from Boo Bart, the blonde.  Ah, Boo Bart.  She'd invite me to where she was dancing all the fucking time.  And once again, no, no, no.  I can't.  No.  Oh, God.  Stopped in there once.  I forgot why.  You might have been there.  I think we might have had a gig.  We might have had a gig at the place she was dancing at. 
[01:51:00]  And she was trying hard to get me into the private room and everything.  Ah, no.  No, no, no, no.  No.  No.  No.  The correct answer was yes.  Yes!  The correct answer was yes.  You got it wrong.  And then I got, and then I got, I know I've told this story, but I got tricked once.  We all, like, convinced our women that we're going to go to a strip club together.  Do you remember this?  Yes.  I think it was Tens.  Tens Show Club.  Which is the one up there in Hampton Beach, close to Hampton Beach Casino. 
[01:51:30]  And we just finished one of our gigs, and we're all like, let's go to a strip club.  And I'm looking at my girl at the time, and she's like, mm.  Yeah.  Yours is kind of into it.  And there were other girls involved, so it was like a whole pack of us.  So finally everyone's like, yeah, let's do this.  I'm like, this is cool.  All right.  This is a little different than the mundane that became my relationship at the time.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  So we're going to a strip club, and then I realize I couldn't look at anything.  No, she was getting very angry.  Because she was giving me evil eyes.  I'm like, then why the fuck are we in here?  You were getting the stink eye.  And I remember to this day that I finally found a spot at the bar near the beer taps.  Yeah.  And I would just stare at the beer taps, because it was safer to do that.  Yeah, you were going to get into big trouble.  But then I would get, like, reflections of some shit off the beer taps.  You had to look at reflections off the beer taps?  In a strip club.  I'm like, why the fuck are we even here? 
[01:52:30]  Because now she's looking at me to see if I'm looking at the girls.  The shit you would have had to deal with.  And then I was looking at the girls, and then I'm getting the evil look, like, what the fuck?  But that's why people go to those establishments.  There's no shit.  So that's my point.  Why do we even walk in the front door?  You'd have had to deal with some major shit, though.  You knew that.  So it would outweigh the joy of seeing the nudity in the strip club.  So did she go just to make sure that you didn't have, that you went?  So it's not like you could say, I'm stopping you from having a good time.  But she never wanted to come across as the buzz killer, but she was the buzz killer. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  So she didn't want to be the one to say, I don't want to do this, I guess.  Yep.  But she made sure if you're going to go, you're not going to have one lick of fun in there.  No.  Years later, I went to a strip club with my now wife and a bunch of people from Philly.  It was supposed to be the Elephant Graveyard.  This is a place in Philly.  I forgot the name, but it's like an old house in the suburbs.  I'm not going to make the joke this time.  Good.  Which one? 
[01:53:30]  No, Elephant Graveyard.  I'm just going to leave it alone.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Go ahead.  And we went there specifically because it's called the Elephant Graveyard.  Basically, it's the oldest strippers.  It's their last job.  Oh, God.  This one fucking strip club hired all the ones that were on their way out.  Yeah.  So they called it the Elephant Graveyard, where the old stripper goes to die.  But it turns out when we got there that they finally said enough of the old broads, and they  brought in all the young fucking mead and decided to reestablish themselves. 
[01:54:00]  So I went with my now wife and a brother and a few other people.  And we were dating this time, and we're at the bar, and we order a drink and stuff from  the bartender.  And then this woman comes up to us and goes, what's your names?  And I said, you know, our names, whatever.  And then all of a sudden, the song starts, she starts stripping for us.  Oh.  Did I tell you this story?  Oh, no.  I look at my now wife.  She looks at me.  We break out laughing our asses off. 
[01:54:30]  Oh.  Oh.  And it embarrassed her to the point.  She stopped stripping and covered herself up.  Oh, no.  You're embarrassing.  We went to the bar just to get a drink.  Right.  And she thought we were like, you know, fucking, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Going for like a, you know, a dance.  Oh, boy.  And our reaction was to just openly laugh, and it made her fucking stop stripping.  All right.  You, too.  Because it was the ridiculousness of the whole fucking thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I guess you're not interested, then. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, boy.  Wow.  That was a downer, Hope.  What?  There was a whole conversation about the old days like that.  Yeah, because we were older gentlemen working for a young rock station with a lot of, like, 17, 20, 21-year-olds.  And we were the fucking.  And they all wanted to come into the rock bus.  Oh, did they love the WAF rock bus.  Oh, what's in there?  We'd open the door, they'd give some stuff out, and they would crane their necks and be like, what's in there? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you want a tour?  Right.  The only thing not coming on the rock bus was you guys.  Ah.  You almost understand that Castro guy.  You know?  In a strange way.  No, I'm just fucking.  In a weird little way.  That scumbag should fucking die.  Yeah.  Anyway.  God.  But to answer your question, yes, it's Alan Tick Jr.'s last day. 
[01:56:00]  Oh.  I tell you.  Yesterday, he decided to back out the door.  Why?  Walked right into me backwards.  I don't know.  There's no explaining him.  Oh.  I was walking in the door, into the studio.  He, like, opened the door.  Right.  And I was like, oh, I was ready to wait for somebody to come.  And just walked backwards right into me.  Why?  Like, what?  What's he doing?  Why are you walking backwards?  He's not a smart kid.  No.  He's not the genius in the crew.  No.  Hey, we bringing on Weez's girl for an internship program or what? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, there he is.  Hey.  We are.  Last day.  Wee says she's hot but wacky.  Oh, great.  Uh-oh.  Wheelhouse.  Have you talked to her, Iraq?  Yes.  She's all set.  She starts.  I think they all start in the beginning of June.  Is she a little wacky?  She seemed fine when I talked to her.  All right.  Fine or foin?  Alan, what's going to happen to you after you leave here?  Yeah.  What have you learned?  What did I learn?  That will help you in your future endeavors.  You still haven't learned to shower. 
[01:57:00]  I've noticed that.  Oh, man.  Holy fuck.  A little greasier than usual today, Alan.  Uh, yeah.  Uh.  What happened?  I didn't shower last night.  You don't like to shower?  I love showering.  It's your last day.  Why wouldn't you take a nice shower?  Uh.  You don't like, like, hot water?  No.  Who doesn't like hot water?  Oh, it's the best.  I don't know.  I have bad memories of showering when I was a little kid.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  What happened?  I don't know.  Just bad memories of, like, just feeling like the water's too hot and, like, screaming and 
[01:57:30]  stuff.  The water's too hot and thick and hard and it's going in your ass.  Some weird locked-out shower shit.  What is that about?  I have no idea.  No, I mean, it was weird.  Like, I hated, like, taking, like, hot baths when I was a little kid.  And then sometime around eight years old, I would, like, just sit in the bathtub for,  like, an hour.  And then sometime between that and then and now, I just avoided taking showers altogether.  You ever, uh, you ever try to blow yourself in the bathtub?  Oh.  Uh, no, no.  I, well, I never, I never, I could never reach.  My brother did. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, he did.  Did he do it?  I'm not sure.  Did he, did he reach?  It's the famous story.  It's really hard.  What?  It's really hard to do that.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You tried?  Well, I mean, I've had, you know, I get a boner pretty much every day.  It's, you know, it's, you know, it's, every now and then.  His filthy, greasy boner.  Drinking off and just sliding back and forth.  Oh, gosh.  Greasing palms.  Oh, whoa.  What?  How old are you where it's impossible to blow yourself, you think? 
[01:58:30]  What do you mean?  Like, if we try to blow our, I was going to say, each other.  That's what we got out of here.  We've got to blow your seats.  Let's see what happens.  You're never drunk.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Take more medicine.  Like, it would be impossible.  Well, yeah, yeah.  To blow yourself, right?  You're not as limber.  But when do you lose that?  35.  35?  35?  I think it's before that.  I just lost it then. 
[01:59:00]  Fuck.  Oh, what?  I have a year.  I have a year left to see if I can write that old gag.  What year do you think you lose that ship?  I don't think you can do it.  Like, there are some people I've never been able to do it.  It's just, I don't bend that way.  I think it's a special talent.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not just an age thing.  But I think if you're able to do it, it'll go away the older you get.  I only know of two people who have ever been able to do it.  Yeah?  Ron Jeremy and Levin Lanny Poffo. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, really?  That's it.  Well, I've seen some porn guys on various websites do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's pretty impressive.  But on average, how old are you before you're not as pliable?  It's got to be 30.  I mean, it depends.  30?  Yeah.  If you're in shape, because you've got the gut.  I don't think you'll leave your teens.  Yeah?  You think that's it?  Before it becomes impossible.  Well, maybe.  If you've got a big piece and no gut, those things will help. 
[02:00:00]  Right, right.  That's true.  Mars, you're out.  You can't have a big gut.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you can't have a gut.  You just got to have the ability to bend like that.  Some people just don't.  I want to thank Sam for this fucking horrible throat thing.  I didn't give it to you, bro.  How did you get it from my kid before I got it from my kid?  We would have gotten it from your...  Figure that shit out.  ...at the same time.  The incubation period.  You got this a few days before I got it, so that means you gave it to me. 
[02:00:30]  I got it on Wednesday.  Unless he was hanging out with your kid without you.  Oh, God.  What the fuck does that mean?  Really?  Alan.  What the...  Damn.  Nice last day.  Nice last day.  Way to go, Alan.  Way to go, buddy.  Good last day.  Good last day.  Way to make an impression.  Where do you go from here?  Alan Thicke, Jr.  I applied for an internship with...  I don't know.  Should I...  Can I even say it?  Go ahead.  I'll give you a hint.  It's a video game company that employs... 
[02:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Everyone that's ever worked here.  How many people do they fucking need over there?  What the fuck are they doing that they need everybody?  All right.  A rock star game.  That would be a good place for you.  Ah, you gave the name away, dude.  Oh.  I don't know.  I mean...  Yeah?  You're meeting with Laszlo?  No.  He already recommended me for the gig.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  He had an interview with...  Why would he recommend you for the gig?  He had an interview with somebody who works there named Thane.  Thane?  Thane.  You talked to Thane? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, I did.  I accidentally called him Thane.  Isn't it like Thane or something like that?  Oh, my God.  You still don't know?  He doesn't know.  And how is he?  He seemed pretty cool.  Yeah?  I liked him.  He told me that he used to have what Travis does now.  Like, he used to do what Travis does now.  Where?  Here at Opie and Anthony.  Oh, at the Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah.  I don't remember him at all, so...  Oh.  Yeah.  Teasing, of course.  Thane's a good friend.  No, he was a pretty cool guy.  I liked him a lot.  We had a nice conversation.  Did you meet Danny? 
[02:02:00]  No, I haven't met Danny.  Danny, um, I heard...  What about D-Boy?  Unkind things about him.  What?  D-Boy?  D-Boy.  You heard what?  Unkind things about him?  About Danny, yeah.  What'd you hear?  Whoa.  Not a rock star, just around here, so I'm kind of...  Whoa.  Whoa.  What'd you hear?  Do tell last day.  Oh.  Um, well, Sal told me that...  Sal?  Um, he is the biggest asshole you will ever meet in your life.  Whoa!  Yeah.  Sal? 
[02:02:30]  Sally!  What problems did Sal have with Danny?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just heard that, like, out of anybody I will ever meet in my life, he is the biggest asshole  I will ever meet.  Wow!  Damn, still controversial.  I'm really nervous about meeting him now.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Sal?  Yes?  What was your beef with Danny Ross?  No, Danny was just very irritable towards me.  No, it's not very irritable.  Don't play it down.  And our friend over here, Alan Thicke Jr., said that you had said, the biggest asshole 
[02:03:00]  you've ever met in your life.  I've ever met in my entire life.  What was the problem?  What was the problem?  Well, I didn't have any, like, specific arguments with Danny, but...  How do you get the biggest asshole?  Even if I just looked at Danny the wrong way, he would, you would yell at me about something  or anything.  Like what?  Example.  Example.  We need an example.  To be the biggest asshole in your life that you've ever met, you got some examples.  I remember when I was an intern, like one of my first days here, I said good morning  to him, and he got so pissed off at me. 
[02:03:30]  And I was like, from that moment on, I was petrified of Danny.  What did he say?  He was like, what the fuck are you just saying?  I'm like, Danny, I just said good morning.  And from that day forward, I just tried to avoid Danny.  He yelled at you for saying good morning.  Yeah, and I was like, I was just scared of Danny.  I'm still scared of Danny.  Yeah, yeah.  He's scared the hell out of me.  You better not get fired, because everyone goes over to Rockstar.  Oh, yeah.  That's like the fucking, the place to be.  Hey, isn't this great?  The biggest asshole ever.  Yeah, I mean, just, just, he's scared, like I said, he would, he would just snap at me. 
[02:04:00]  Just snap at me.  Maybe he just didn't like you.  One time, one time, okay, we have the...  Oh, here we go.  I remember, yeah, I was trying to figure out a scenario.  Yeah.  I remember one time, like we have, like, Eric used to track in there, like the logs, like,  you know, just writes down, like, what's going on, topics, all that sort of stuff.  And...  He's supposed to.  Yeah, he's supposed to.  A Swiss log?  And Danny used to do the replays.  Those are those big yodels.  Food. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Danny used to do the replay, so he would do the pad data for the replay, right?  Uh-huh.  And I used, I still, I typed a daily email that goes out to everybody.  And I asked Danny to see the logs, just for, like, an extra second.  Oh, boy.  He went ballistic on me.  He was like, you're, you're the new guy here, blah, blah, blah, screaming at me.  And I just, I was, like, shaking in my boots, like, I was so scared.  He was like, you should, you, I'm above you, all this sort of crap.  And I was just like...  And I think, I think Eric was, Eric, you were there for that, right? 
[02:05:00]  I think so, yeah.  And I was just like, I was like, Danny, here are the logs, whenever you need, you're like,  sorry, I apologize.  Yeah, I was just, I was, that scared the fuck out of me.  That's too funny.  That is funny.  Oh, he was fucking with you so bad.  All you did was ask?  I said, Danny, can I just see the logs for an extra two seconds?  Because I was like, you know, the email doesn't take long to write.  Sure.  And he just went ballistic on me.  Were you a little cunt-y, though, when you asked?  Probably.  Can I see the logs for two more seconds?  No, I was always very polite.  You think maybe I could see the logs? 
[02:05:30]  You know?  No, I never had to share when I was growing up.  Yeah, yeah.  No, like I said, from that first interaction I had with Danny, ever since that point forward,  I knew I had to handle him in a very delicate way.  So I would always try to be nice and cordial to him.  How'd that work out?  He screamed at me.  To see two sheets of paper for an extra 30 seconds, he screamed at me.  Wow.  Wow.  So you're looking forward to going over to the rock star and...  Not looking forward to meeting Danny now.  Really?  Danny, sorry. 
[02:06:00]  No, Danny's a cool dude.  Like, I used to talk to him about music.  Did you say he's the biggest asshole you've ever met in your life?  Biggest asshole you've ever met in your life.  Yeah, but like, we relate on certain things.  We like certain music, bands, art, and stuff like that.  This is what everyone does here, by the way.  Of course.  I was talking about how Troy Kwan does this, too.  Yeah.  Oh, you're fucking Alan Thicke Jr.  You're fucking terrible.  You got no work ethic.  You're lazy.  You fucking don't sleep.  You sleep on the job.  You don't shower.  You're a piece of shit.  You're about...  No, I like the kid.  He's great.  He's great.  Hang on with his...  There's always this weird...  When Danny was nice to me, it was awesome.  Like, it was great.  It was a good day.  Like, everything was cool. 
[02:06:30]  It's like when the terrorist, who's been beating you every day, goes,  Chocolate?  Yeah.  You want chocolate today?  And it's like, oh, this is great.  He's giving me a piece of chocolate.  Exactly.  Maybe you'll go home today.  Right.  Maybe I'll go home today.  And then they take you out, they drive you around the block,  and drive you right back to the fucking prison again.  No!  That fucking bridge of your nose is gone.  Abu Nazir.  Yeah.  So it was exactly that.  Like, maybe we chat about posters or whatever.  It's amazing, though, that somebody could be the biggest asshole you ever met in your  life, and then...  Hey, it's a cool guy, though. 
[02:07:00]  Cool guy, though.  How can he be cool?  No, no.  I didn't say he's a cool guy.  I said we can relate...  He's dead.  I said we can relate...  Stockholm Syndrome.  It's a little bit of Stockholm Syndrome.  Stockholm Syndrome.  I said we can relate on certain things.  Like, we had similar issues.  Yeah, yeah.  I wouldn't hang out with Danny, because he scares the fuck out of me still to this day.  So...  Wow.  He got you shook.  He really fucking shook you up.  Danny got me good.  Yeah.  And now you're going to fucking go over and try to intern over there at Rockstar?  Well...  Have fun.  Well...  Have fun, my friend.  I have a question, because he told me he had the interview, but he was waiting to hear.  So I don't know if he actually has it yet.  Do you know how degrading it is to stand there being yelled at while you're wearing a motion 
[02:07:30]  cap ping pong suit?  You'll learn.  His pants are tight.  Oh, those pants are tight.  You better have a big dick there, because you look like you're in leotard.  You're in a giant fucking leotard, bedazzled with ping pong balls, with someone yelling  at you.  Enjoy.  That's what they make all their interns do, right?  Motion cap shot.  Motion cap.  That's what you'll do.  Good.  Fall down.  Great.  Now run.  Good.  Jump.  Great.  Now get kicked in the nuts.  Yeah.  We're going to do this thing. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Danny will come over and be like, we're going to kick you in the nuts now.  All day, we have a segment of the game where this guy gets kicked in the nuts.  It's you.  Stand there.  You're falling in pain wrong.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Sal would be like, whatever you say, whatever you say.  I take the shot from Danny.  Just for the fact that he wouldn't yell at me later on in the day.  You're a cool guy.  I love you.  It's great.  Let's talk about music, please.  It's insane that he's afraid of him.  He's not even here anymore. 
[02:08:30]  He was fired a different season ago.  Right.  I'm still terrified of Danny.  The weather was different when he was fired.  Is he a big guy?  Made an impression.  No.  No.  No?  No.  I have no idea what this guy looks like.  I have no idea about him other than the fact that Sal thinks he's the biggest asshole  ever.  Oh, Jesus.  Right.  So, I really don't know what to make of this.  Oh, boy.  He knew it was his last day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He got you.  This is last day intern fucking dialogue right here.  Fuck the world, niggas.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  What else do you want to say on your last day?  Yeah.  What else?  Well, I mean, there was that whole thing about, remember when Troy was all getting up about  my girlfriend?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  On the after show, Alan was showing pictures of his girlfriend or ex-girlfriend.  They're in a gray area.  Is that the black chick?  Yeah.  Pop her up on the finger so we could see.  Yeah, go ahead.  Troy was talking about how hot she was and then we told him the story about Troy fucking  the other intern's girlfriend.  Oh, right.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Fuck. 
[02:09:30]  That was brutal.  So, I guess intern Alan here went and told his girlfriend everything that had happened  and then started showing her pictures of Troy.  And what?  Why would you do that, you cuck?  Fuck.  I thought it was funny.  Tell me how it would be like if Troy was fucking you right now instead of me.  I'm watching.  Let's see her picture.  I'm going to come inside you, cream pie it in my face, but try to convince me it's Troy's  cum. 
[02:10:00]  That's her right there?  Let me see.  She looks like someone.  Yeah, she does.  She's not all black.  No fucking way.  She's like a quarter white, I think.  I'd say third.  I'm going third white.  Octoroon.  Yeah, if she's only a quarter white, there's some Hispanic in there too.  High yellow.  Is that her right there?  No.  Oh, look at that.  Artsy picture of Alan.  You missed one.  These are all the pictures that you see left on the computers at Apple when people use  the effects to take snapshots of themselves. 
[02:10:30]  Jesus.  She's all right.  Let me see.  That was the one that Troy kind of went off on.  She got a little sister in her there.  She looks like she could get the chicken head going.  Hell yeah, motherfucker.  And if you actually look at her name, she has a very normal name, but it's spelled.  Normal?  What are you saying?  Black people have abnormal names?  You fucking racist?  Yeah, what the fuck, dude?  Well, no.  It's just not spelled normally.  Oh, okay.  What the shit?  Who's normal league?  So what's wrong with your relationship with her?  I mean, we just dated for like a year and a half.  It kind of ran its course. 
[02:11:00]  Jafaka?  Jafaka?  Lost my virginity to her.  You did?  Yeah.  Well, of course.  She took something.  People do.  Jesus.  She stole it.  She stole your virginity.  Like a bicycle.  So what'd she say?  Troy's not here, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of feel dirty talking about him like this.  You like that.  Well, all right.  That's all I like, sister.  So I showed her pictures of Troy because she was curious.  She's like, so this guy, you know, wants to have sex with me?  I was like, yeah, sure.  And I showed him pictures. 
[02:11:30]  And her immediate reaction was, ugh, he looks like an old Jew.  I wish Troy was here.  Why isn't Troy here today?  I really wish he was here.  I'd love to talk about him with this.  I'm going skateboarding tonight.  I'm going to be DJing in the city.  She hated the gold chains.  I got the big gig.  She hated his haircut.  She was just like, never in a million years.  I was like, wow.  Wow.  I can't wait to talk about this.  Now, is that just like young?  How old is she? 
[02:12:00]  She's 21.  Is that young girl thing?  Or is that black girl thing with Troy?  Troy's always said, black girls love me.  Young girls love me.  So I mean, either way.  All girls love Troy.  That's like.  We've learned that.  That sentence is everything on this earth that Troy is most afraid of.  Look at me on my skateboard.  Boy, I'm going to pull an oy vey.  What?  Wow.  So you lost your virginity to her.  She.  And you still. 
[02:12:30]  Are you still fucking up?  Every now and then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's dip it in.  Yeah.  All right.  She's all right.  She's all right.  She got enough white in her where it's.  It's that that black chick that's got enough white in her where she's going to make that  hair decision.  Do I just get a weave for the straight hair?  Or do I try to straighten this shit out?  Right.  Myself.  Because she's got enough.  She's straight.  But it might look a little frizzy without some processing.  And it's a lot of work.  Or I could just fucking clip in that weave.  She's.  You could describe it this way. 
[02:13:00]  You could bring her to like a family picnic.  Maybe you.  A family picnic.  But you can't bring her for like Christmas dinner.  Oh.  Let me bring up a point there.  Maybe like some kind of.  At a family picnic.  You know.  There's a lot more people.  And there's a lot more distractions.  You got the family softball game.  Or the tug of war.  Or the fucking.  Someone's carving out a goddamn watermelon.  Let's say there's a big party at my house.  Right.  Right.  But.  Let's say there's a big party at my house.  I got my Uncle Tony. 
[02:13:30]  My Aunt Fran's over.  All the relatives are there.  And I bring a girl like this.  Right.  Over.  Over.  And introduce her.  And like.  Yeah.  That's not the same as like.  Walking into.  My Aunt and Uncle's house.  Over there in East North Port.  On fucking Thanksgiving.  Right.  And being.  You know.  Hey.  Right.  It's a lot different.  Right.  They'd be fine with it.  I think.  In my yard for a party.  Well you bring her to.  She's thick.  She got thick legs.  You bring her to a family picnic aunt.  Yeah.  Your family looks at you like.  Ah.  He's just.  Yeah.  He had a good night last night. 
[02:14:00]  He's trying.  And decided.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you bring her to Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner.  It's a little more serious.  My uncle would call that being an oil derrick.  An oil derrick.  And the girls.  It's called being a coal burner.  Right.  That's what my racist family would say.  As a matter of fact.  My.  One of my cousins.  Yeah.  Was actually married and had a kid.  With a black gentleman.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh so you got a little of that in your family. 
[02:14:30]  Well you don't have to put it that way.  They're since divorced though.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the family's much happier.  She was born in.  She was born on Long Island.  But the father for his job and stuff.  Moved the whole family to fucking Baltimore.  Baltimore.  And man.  She couldn't get enough fucking black cock I guess.  Holy mother of fuck.  So that happens.  So there's a black kid?  Yeah.  Well whatever percentage. 
[02:15:00]  But yeah.  There you go.  Do you see this black kid?  No.  They live down in Baltimore.  Oh Balimor.  Balimor.  Any other.  She's alright.  That's like.  She got a nice color.  I like the color.  It's not too dark.  It's very tan like.  Charcoal briquette.  Almost Hispanic.  Yeah.  It's not charcoal briquette.  It's milk chocolate.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like dark chocolate to eat.  That's light.  Light.  Milk chocolate to date.  Right. 
[02:15:30]  Right.  Light and sweet.  She's.  She has thick around the legs though.  But you know.  Extra cream.  Goes with the territory.  She's a little bottom heavy in this room.  Extra cream in the coffee there.  That's all.  You go down on her?  She doesn't like that.  Yeah.  I heard you say that.  You know why?  You're doing it wrong.  I don't care.  I don't.  What?  I don't like doing that shit.  You don't like doing that shit?  You don't like doing that shit?  Queeb Quay.  Queeb Quay.  Why would you like doing that?  You know why?  It's a sour.  You don't like doing it to pleasure the woman. 
[02:16:00]  Oh my god.  It's like putting your nose inside like an old fish.  I can't do that shit.  Well, maybe you ought to fucking, you know.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Maybe you ought to diversify your fucking dating pool.  Right.  You know?  Really.  If you're smelling fish, there's a problem there.  Really breaking down the stereotypes there.  You know, you could get sushi at one place and it's great.  Good at the other place.  It smells a little.  This is from the guy who doesn't shower anything.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm sure your ball bag is not a treat to her either.  I talc that shit up.  You what?  I talc it.  Oh yeah, talc.  Great. 
[02:16:30]  It's like fucking plaster of Paris.  That's how it mixes with your grease.  Ugh.  Jesus.  Fuck that.  Nah, you gotta fucking go down on it, girl.  You know what?  You get one smelly one, it will throw you off for a while, though.  You gotta stay in the game, though.  I understand.  You gotta just mouth breathe and work around it.  You gotta work around it with a mouth breathe and just, you know, stay focused.  Stay focused.  I had a smelly one, Alan.  I understand.  Don't go deep.  And it threw me off for a little bit. 
[02:17:00]  Stay shallow.  Stay shallow.  Stay on the clit and the outside.  Don't go deep when you got one of those.  You could even maybe work your fingers.  Stay shallow.  Stay high up on it.  Right.  That'll get you through those musky ones.  Keep your eye on it.  Keep your eye on it.  Right.  Eye on the prize.  Eye on the prize.  Keep your eye on the prize.  Keep your eye on it.  You get the smelly fingers?  Yeah.  Oh, she might have one of those problem vaginas.  Well, I mean, like, you know, she got checked out and stuff. 
[02:17:30]  There's nothing going on down there.  Apparently, when your face is down there, there's nothing going on either.  If you get the smelly fingers, there might be something going on down there.  Maybe.  But then again, you don't shower, so the smell stays with you.  Nothing more challenging than a girl that says, I don't like that, or I've never been  able to come when a guy's gone down on me.  To me, that's dig in.  I'm like an old cartoon character.  You put a big napkin around my neck.  And you pull up your sleeves.  I pull my sleeves up.  And you get to work. 
[02:18:00]  I get the knife and the fork in each hand.  I'm like, bring on the pussy.  Bring on the pussy.  It's a challenge at that point.  You smash your face down there and go to town.  I'm going to crack this safe.  Alan, how do you lick pussy?  Poorly.  Well, I mean, look, I've done it with other girls before.  And I had a girl, like, orgasm, like, six times one time doing it.  What?  Yeah.  Like, it's not like I can't do it.  She's just not into it.  No, you said you weren't into it.  Well, I'm not into it, but I mean. 
[02:18:30]  But you've been into it with other girls.  Did you try it with her at all?  Yeah.  Did she tell you she wasn't into it before you tried it?  She was apprehensive about me doing it.  Eh, you're poor.  You were doing it shittily.  You were doing it shittily.  Yeah.  But that's why.  You ever lick her butthole?  Ooh.  Oof.  Well, I've threatened to do it before.  Threatened?  What the fuck is this?  Now it's a problem?  Hey, don't make me lick your asshole.  What is that? 
[02:19:00]  This guy's weird.  How do you threaten to do it?  Eh, it's just one of those things where we're, like, sitting in bed.  And it's like, how far would you go to one of those games?  Oh.  Yeah, so she's like, it's like, I'll put my finger up your butt.  She said, home.  I was like, well, if you're going to do that, then I'll tongue that shit in deep, you know?  But you didn't have the intention of doing these things?  It was like, let's see what we can say to each other?  No, I was going to, I would do it.  Like, if she really pushed me, I would do it.  But, like, I knew she wouldn't do any of the things she threatened to do to me.  Have you ever done that with a girl? 
[02:19:30]  What?  Stick tongue her ass?  Nah, nah, I'm not into analangus.  Was it analangus?  Is that what it's called?  Sounds right, analangus.  How about it?  Is that your girlfriend's name?  Let me say hi to Keith in Connecticut.  Keith.  All right.  Keith.  What's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  So, listen, I work with this girl, and she and I, for months, have just been talking,  sexting, all excited about hooking up.  And she's real dirty.  She talks about the shit she sticks up her ass when she masturbates.  Yesterday, I finally got the opportunity to hook up with her. 
[02:20:00]  And I love eating box.  Oh.  Like, if they made box-flavored toothpaste, I would hook that shit up.  I'll get carried away.  All right.  Well, you know, when I go down, I go down for a long time.  The smell was so bad.  And I'm thinking, like, oh, you were mentioning something could be wrong.  The smell, when you finally got in there and, like, started getting wet, it smelled like onions.  Like this strong onion smell.  And I'm thinking, how can you not smell this? 
[02:20:30]  You know what I mean?  So, you know, I had to pull up.  After, like, two minutes, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I was fucking gagging.  Gagging.  Yeah, that's a problem, vagina.  But what do you think it is?  It's that, I don't know the name of it, but some girls have the smelly fucking vagina.  That's a real problem.  They can't get the smell away.  How do you not know?  How do you not know?  I mean, she knew, and this was planned.  So she was showered.  She smelled great, you know, off top.  But then how does the smell not hit her? 
[02:21:00]  You know what I mean?  Well, after the break, we get Dr. Steve back on the line.  He'll explain the whole thing to you.  Some girls have smelly vaginas, and there's nothing they can really do about it.  Oh, vaginosis.  Is it vaginosis?  It's a fluid.  Yeah.  You ever have one where you can smell it through the jeans?  Fuck.  That's...  Thank you, Keith.  You mean on the cellular level?  Yeah.  All right, Alan.  We got to do live reads for Mother's Day.  All right, man.  Thanks for having me on. 
[02:21:30]  That's it, huh?  That's your last appearance, probably, on the Opian Anthony radio show.  It's kind of upsetting.  You're leaving.  Going on to the tyranny of Danny Ross over at Rockstar Games, according to Sal.  He did get to throw Sal under the bus.  He did.  That was a good one.  He did throw Sal under the bus with Danny.  Well, I mean, I don't want to keep you guys from your live reads.  I thought I was going to come in here and defend my door-closing shenanigans.  What was that, by the way?  Why did you walk backwards out a door that has a lot of traffic through it, especially during a break? 
[02:22:00]  Well, it's just when the door closes during the show,  you can hear it go, clunk, like, in the middle of the show.  I hear it every single time.  We love all those.  It drives me insane.  So why be backwards?  Because I want to make sure the door closes as slow as possible so you don't hear it close.  You could just do it with your back.  You could, like, let it kind of hit your back and kind of...  I have more control in the front.  You're a weird kid.  But fuck the door.  How about the people walking in the door?  Yeah.  A little strange.  A little strange.  Sam figures this stuff out pretty much every day after.  Is it because you're a geek? 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  See, the thing is, when he was, like, a little kid...  Is he weird or is he a geek?  When he was a little...  He's got this weird compliment.  He was fat when he was a little kid.  And had no eyebrows.  And had no eyebrows.  Why didn't he have eyebrows?  I'll show you a picture.  I don't know.  I grew him when I was, like, 13 years old, but I didn't have eyebrows until then.  He was a fat Boy Scout with no eyebrows.  What are you talking about?  That's fucking weird right there.  Here, I'll show you.  That's...  You've got bushy eyebrows now.  It's not unibrow, actually.  I have to groom it.  He's, like, a handsome guy now.  I'm a hipster.  What are you talking about?  He had no eyebrows.  You've got hipster pictures.  Oh, my God.  Wait till you see this kid. 
[02:23:00]  Let me see.  Yeah.  He just sat home playing video.  Look at this fat kid with no eyebrows.  Oh, you are a little chub.  They shaved your eyebrows.  No.  I swear to God, it was just like that.  Something happened to you in the tub.  Yeah, you're one of those little fat kids that gets...  Why don't you have eyebrows?  Let me see.  Let me find out.  They look like they were shaved.  Oh, my God.  That's you?  Yeah, that's me.  Why are you laying on the piano bench looking like you're ready to take a dick in the ass?  I liked how it felt to have, like, the chair push up against my belly and chest. 
[02:23:30]  Whoa.  Chair means uncle.  Like the fabulous Baker boys.  Oh, yeah.  How did young intern Alan not grow up to look like E-Rock?  That is a young E-Rock.  Why are you posing?  He looks like E-Rock.  Were you trying to get some, like, work in the entertainment business?  It's like a headshot.  Nah, it's just...  I was just chilling watching cartoons.  And why does he have eyebrows?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That is really strange.  Fucking lemon tree haircut.  He's fat.  Yeah, you got really bad haircuts.  Who cut your hair?  Well, I would go to, like, the super cuts. 
[02:24:00]  Like, the five dog places.  Yeah, definitely.  That's the cheapest haircut a kid can get.  It's the generic I'm a kid haircut.  Fat kid with no eyebrows.  Fat kid.  Cub Scout.  Piece of shit.  You're like the kid that would cry in the movies, the fat kid that would just cry in  the movie?  That's fairly accurate.  Yeah?  Were you a little pissy eyes?  Yeah, I was pretty pissy eyed.  Don't worry.  You get past that when all emotion and love and tenderness goes out the fucking window after  you've been run through the mill long enough in life.  It's great. 
[02:24:30]  Scroll down.  Was there a picture of you petting a cat?  Yeah, that was my cat, Silver.  What happened to it?  Ran away.  Dead.  That's not a big surprise.  No, I cried for quite some time.  Why?  Because my cat ran away, man.  I was like eight years old.  It's because you're fucking weird.  That's why it ran away.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't want to be around you.  Hang out with some fat kid with no eyebrows.  Cat's like, get me the fuck out of here.  Why don't you have eyebrows?  That's really weird.  It is strange.  I don't know. 
[02:25:00]  Have you ever asked your parents?  No, it's just something that...  You don't remember them shaving it or any of that shit?  Did you used to pluck your eyebrows?  No.  Anything?  No, nothing.  Nothing.  Could you shave your eyebrows for your last day?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  All right.  For your last day.  That's a good idea.  Sal wants to put money on it.  Fine.  You know what?  Yeah, if you put money on it, I'll do it.  How much?  How much?  Sal wants to do 30 bucks.  Okay, Sal can pay 30.  Yeah.  We're going to get it done for free, you idiot, Sal. 
[02:25:30]  We had him.  And now he'll only offer the money if you know he's not going to do it for free.  Yeah.  Now he throws Sal under the bus and gets 30 of his dollars.  You would really let us shave your eyebrows on your last day?  That's a good idea.  30 dollars is a little light, I think.  Sal, can you do better than 30?  Thanks, Sal.  Yeah.  He's checking.  Hang on.  It just cost me five bucks.  I got five.  If everyone throws in 10, I'll be good.  I'll actually do that.  Do you want to shave his eyebrows?  Dollar Shave Club would love us. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, they really would.  Can I at least have the razor when you're done?  No.  No.  No.  That's too much.  Too much.  Too much.  He's a weird kid.  He is.  Sal's up to 40 bucks.  Sal's $40.  All right.  $40 is fair.  Are we going to shave your eyebrows?  If you, Sam, Opie, and Anthony give me $10 each, I'll do it.  And then Sal has to give you $40 as well?  And that'll be $70.  I can buy you a video game or something.  Cool.  Cool.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:26:30]  You see how strange you looked with no eyebrows as a kid?  You're going to look really weird as an adult.  Okay.  They grow back.  Yeah, they'll grow back.  I have really bushy eyebrows.  They'll grow back.  I get to do it, though, right?  As long as you don't nick me and make me bleed all over my face.  There's a lot of capillaries or whatever the hell they're called.  Capillaries.  Capillaries.  Capillaries.  Capillaries.  Capillaries.  Yeah, whatever.  Capillaries.  That really is strange.  Yeah.  You don't have to worry about that.  You don't zombie out your face with these razors. 
[02:27:00]  Nick.  Or nick them.  He doesn't like them.  They finally moved on from zombie.  Yeah, but if Sal shaves his eyebrows, Sal should have to do it bronzered up in a G-string.  No, that's gay.  Okay.  We did that already?  Yeah.  That was your idea.  And we lost all the calls on the smelly vaginas.  Oh, Sal.  One guy had a great story.  He was with this girl who warned him how bad her vagina smelled.  And all she did was scrub it all day long.  I want to talk to that guy.  He couldn't wait around, I guess. 
[02:27:30]  Well, that's...  Maybe he'll be back after the break.  That's interesting.  She'd scrub it, yet it still smelled.  Mm-hmm.  Are we doing this?  Yeah?  Might as well.  Yeah, okay.  I'm in.  For a video game.  I can do it for a video game.  If I have a video game or something.  I'm in.  Or something.  I'll throw you a 20.  I don't think I have tens.  Yeah.  I only have 50, so if you could break it 50...  Well, with Sal's money and...  Many. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, no, I got it.  That's good for my 10, then.  He's give you 20, he just said.  Oh, yeah.  That's all good, then.  Good one, Sam.  Wow, did Sam just fucking...  He's the worst.  Sam fucked everyone in that one.  That's the S.O.B. I've ever met in my life.  It's all good.  But he's a great guy.  Wow.  But.  But.  But.  Great guy?  He's a great guy.  He's cool to hang out with.  Yeah, you're a great guy.  Yeah, you gotta say that.  Never any blatant insults.  What do we got?  I got 20.  Nice.  Yeah, all right.  Sal's got the 20.  Sal's got the 40.  That's 80.  That's enough for a video game or something. 
[02:28:30]  Jesus, Sam.  You put this kid through hell.  Give him a fucking...  Pull out a couple bucks on his last day.  Yeah.  You even make him cry?  Isn't that odd?  Yeah, yeah.  What about Mars over here?  I said I had a 20, and you said all I got is 50s?  You have all 50s.  You have the 20, and all I have are 50s.  That's fucking weird.  I have a...  Yeah, make change of this fucking 50.  All right, I'll make change.  Here's a 10.  Oh.  And then give me the... 
[02:29:00]  10 big ones.  Here.  And then just get a 20 from Opie.  I take that.  All right, you're up to $50.  Yeah, you're up to 50.  And 40 from Sal.  And 40 from Sal.  And 40 from Sal.  I got $90 out of this deal.  Fuck.  Easiest 90 bucks I've ever made.  For a video game, and he's going to work for a video game company.  I don't care.  Yeah, I wouldn't either.  You're right.  I love video games.  Right.  They're my favorite thing.  Way better than Ibrows.  They really are a lot of fun.  What are you playing now?  I'm about halfway through Mark of the Ninja.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a really cool side-scrolling stealth game where you get to play the ninja. 
[02:29:30]  Side-scrolling, wow.  Yeah.  It's fucking old school.  Well, it's a really big thing now that the indie scene is starting to boom because of  the internet and Xbox Live and PSN.  There's a lot of great, like, you know, 2D.  I don't know.  He's really weird.  I'm so into fucking game immersion.  I like good fucking 3D graphics.  You still playing Sims?  The SimCity one?  No.  I kind of moved on.  Yeah, you know.  But that isn't really what I was talking about, E-Roc.  I like a good first-person shooter. 
[02:30:00]  Like Fallout 3?  Yeah, yeah.  Something with a good storyline to it.  Something that really gets you into the game.  Good fucking sound effects and music that really can fuck you up.  Right.  Make you feel like something's behind you.  Do you like Bioshock?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Well, Bioshock's probably one of the best first-person shooters ever.  Fucking good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you like any of the older ones, like Deus Ex?  I loved Deus Ex.  The original one's fucking amazing.  Half-Life has been, like, the best game ever, I think.  Yeah, I can...  That came out. 
[02:30:30]  Totally good.  Fucking Outcry was fucking really good.  But, yeah.  I fucking, you know, love those.  If you want, I can make you a list of some really great games that you might not have heard of.  All right.  All right.  He was getting very happy.  There was a relationship building.  There was a rapport.  And then he wanted to see, how far can I...  Ah, too far.  I love it.  I love it.  Ah, too far.  Look, we do have to break us.  No, I understand.  Damn it.  It's the stupid Mother's Day shit.  Is your mom alive?  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I love her.  Oh, okay.  Oh, hey, I didn't even ask. 
[02:31:00]  Just wondering.  Oh, sorry.  That's great.  Good.  All right, Alan.  We're going to shave your eyebrows on your last day here next.  We're going to talk about smelly vaginas.  And now we're going to talk about our mommies.  Yes.  Where do we have to hit that thing first?  Hit that break.  Hit the break first?  It doesn't matter.  I mean...  The OPNF Show.  A lot of what you do.  I can't sleep.  I toss and turn.  Camel sticks in the dark.  Visions of body's being burned.  Four walls just staring at a nigga.  I'm paranoid sleeping with my finger on the trigger. 
[02:31:30]  Whoa.  My mother's always stressing I ain't living right.  But I ain't going out without a fight.  See, every time my eyes close,  I start sweating  and blood starts coming out my nose.  Whoa.  It's somebody watching me act.  But I don't know who it is.  So I'm watching my back.  I can see him when I'm deep in the covers.  When I awake, I don't see the motherfuckers.  Oh, easy with the language.  A black suit and a cane like my own.  Some might say take a chill bee. 
[02:32:00]  But fuck that shit.  There's a nigga trying to kill me.  Easy with the racial epithets.  Whip when the wind blows.  Every 20 seconds got me peeping out my window.  Investigating the joint for traps.  Taking my telephone for text.  I'm staring at the wall right on the corner.  It's fucked up when your mind's playing tricks on you.  My mind's playing tricks on me.  Fucking shit's good.  How do you get this song on the radio?  I can't. 
[02:32:30]  But how do you get it on the radio?  They sing the bad words backwards.  All right.  We got Alan.  What?  You getting nervous, Alan?  Nah, I'm just a little sweaty from running.  Oh.  Well, I'll add to your...  Ripeness?  Greasiness.  Yeah.  You're a weird kid.  I think some girl smelled me on the elevator ride up.  She was hot, too.  She had to come turn around and did that little scrunchy nose thing.  Scrunchy nose.  I'll smell his armpits.  Oh, Jesus.  What smells bad on him?  There's pit stains.  Not bad?  It's not bad. 
[02:33:00]  When he wears his leather jacket, something about the muskiness is that boy.  Potpourri for you?  Yeah.  What's up?  Um...  You see, you didn't even hesitate.  I would never smell your armpits, Alan.  That's nothing comparatively to what I've done in here, though.  That's true.  But that's why you make the...  Smell the back of his pants.  His pants are on, so it's not...  No, I have Eric do that.  I don't want to do that.  No, no.  Go ahead, Sal.  Go ahead. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, my God.  Put your nose right up against where the butthole would be.  But he's got his jeans on, so it's all good.  And just smell.  Don't worry about it, bro.  I can't do it.  You could do it.  Jesus.  Nothing.  You're not going to weigh up there.  No, I'm not doing...  That's it.  Why is he turning into me?  Why are you so angry?  Because I don't want to do this.  I was just going to shave him a sip.  But you'll pay 40 bucks.  To shave him, not to smell his ass.  I can't fart on command, so don't worry about it.  All right, let's do this.  Alan, what's the weirdest thing you've ever done in your life?  Wow.  Shit. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, you're, like, strange.  Have you ever contemplated shooting up a school or anything?  Oh, no.  Absolutely not.  I mean, I thought about killing my elementary school bullies, but I've never thought about  anything other than that.  Well, isn't it?  More like...  Yeah.  But I mean, like, outside of school.  Like, they didn't bother me in school.  They only bothered me, like, on the bus and...  What'd they do to you?  Shave your eyebrows, obviously.  How did they bully you?  I mean, like, they just were relentless about, like, the fat jokes and stuff.  Oh.  You want to comment? 
[02:34:30]  How'd you lose the weight?  Because you're a slender, tall gentleman.  Well, when I was...  How tall are you?  6'3".  And how much do you weigh?  Now, 210.  I gained 10 pounds since I started interning here.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Yeah.  Right, E-Rock.  Oh.  Jesus.  But, yeah, I lost the weight because sometime around the 7th grade, I started playing tennis.  And I played about two hours a day for the entire summer.  And I just lost, like, something like 60 pounds.  What a guy.  Yeah.  It was weird.  Like, I still actually have shirts from the 7th grade. 
[02:35:00]  They still fit me.  Oh.  Yeah, I was always a really fat kid.  I think I weighed...  At the time, when I started losing my weight, I was 185.  Really?  Yeah, and I must have been at, like, 5'6 at that point, so...  Did your parents just look at you like, oh, fuck, we got one of these?  Yeah, pretty much.  You have a little fat kid that can't do anything.  They took me to the Golden Corral one too many times.  Did they?  Yeah, we used to go to the Golden Corral all the time.  That place tastes like shit.  So it's their fault?  We just went there all the time.  It's their fault.  Blame your parents.  That's good.  I mean, I can't blame my parents.  Yeah.  You sure? 
[02:35:30]  Because my brother turned...  My brother was always a skinny kid, so...  Mm.  You know.  Maybe it's a genetic thing.  I don't know.  Mm.  Yeah.  Golden Corral.  Who goes there?  Isn't that, like, a popular...  The place with the brothers?  I don't know.  Red Lobster, shit like that.  Yeah, what kind of food they got?  Like, fried chicken, pizza.  Fried chicken pizza.  I think they have chili.  I haven't been there, like, in years.  Maybe some cornbread, I think.  Cornbread.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I could have some of your wife's cornbread. 
[02:36:00]  They have soft swirl machines.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I remember the last time I went there, there was still a smoking section.  Oh, it's been a while.  So it's been a real long time, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, but, yeah, no.  It went from that to, like, this Grand China Buffet place, which was just an all-you-can-eat  Chinese place, and I love that.  You ever eat at a nice restaurant with your family?  Or do they just go to these shithole fucking chain restaurants?  Yeah, we go to nice restaurants.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's just, I don't know.  I mean, like, a lot of my childhood was spent in those crap-ass places. 
[02:36:30]  Crappy.  Yeah.  Fucking.  So your parents made you fat?  I mean, I guess.  I mean, I'm more attributed to my grandma, because she fed me like I was, like, a price  pig.  No one cares.  You know that, right?  Hey, we're going up beefsteak Charlie's tonight.  Yeah.  He goes, yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  I know no one cares.  No one cares, right?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to shave your eyebrows, make you look stupid, and get you out of here.  That's why I'm here.  Yes, sir.  That's why I'm here.  Oh.  All right.  What are we doing today?  We're going to lay down. 
[02:37:00]  Oh.  Old school barber chair.  It's going to be like in a barber chair.  We've got the little chair there.  It can recline, I guess, right?  That's the recliner?  Oh, Mikey.  And he's going to get his, um...  Well, this is Alan, and I don't know, but he's...  We thought he would say no fucking way, but he said, yeah, sure, you could shave my eyebrows.  Can you move them all the way close to the table here, Sal?  It's because, as a child, we've learned from his little chubby pictures that he was also  not only chubby, he had no eyebrows, and they grew in at some later point. 
[02:37:30]  So we decided...  For some reason.  Let's go old school and shave his eyebrows on Alan's last day.  What are you doing?  You're coaching him, E-Rock?  What are you doing?  What'd you tell him?  Some had to be said so.  What?  What had to be said to him?  Oh, E-Rock, what is this?  Because he's an intern, some instructions had to be given to him so that he understands.  Is that why that idiot was walking down the hall?  I don't know what you're talking about.  Where is that idiot?  Holy shit.  What was told to you?  Do you know, why am I so stupid and naive to believe that we just were doing this and 
[02:38:00]  we would do it without any...  What happened?  Nothing happened.  I was just letting him know that...  What'd you have to let him know?  What did you have to let him know?  That, you know, if at some point he's not comfortable with it and he wants to tap out, he can do so.  And who told you that?  Because this is the type of stuff that made great radio in the history of radio.  Is, is, if you're not comfortable with things...  How much could he sue a company for his eyebrows being shaved?  It's all about safety and him as a person.  I'll write the check today. 
[02:38:30]  Who cares?  Oh, God.  So that's all it was.  Is this fucking disgusting what's happened?  He's all game for this.  Who told you this?  I think everything will go fine.  Who told you this?  Nobody told me that.  Who told you that?  No.  Who told you that?  No, E-Rock, someone told you that.  Someone told you, E-Rock.  No.  You're not that one wasting too much time on this.  We should get right into the shaving.  No, no, no.  Can we raise them up?  Um, I think we could see them there, right?  Yeah.  You got them?  Um...  Is the mic in the way?  God.  Do you think the fucking lovely bean girls wanted to fucking lay there on that blue tarp 
[02:39:00]  getting baked beans rubbed all over them?  If you're not comfortable...  If you're not comfortable, please, ladies, put your clothes back on.  No, E-Rock, 55-Gallon Drum Challenge.  Right, there you go.  The screams of horror.  Yeah.  No, I'm not going to pull it out.  If you're not comfortable, just let us know at any time.  If you're not comfortable when we drop these eels on you.  Right.  Oh, Christ.  I look like the biggest pussy on the planet, so I'm definitely not pulling you out now.  Yeah.  That's right.  There you go.  I'm not touching myself.  But, you know, as long as he's okay. 
[02:39:30]  So, Alan, you're all right with this?  We're going to shave your eyebrows on your last day.  All right.  The moment Sal nicks my face, then I'll finish it off.  Oh.  I'm not going to nick his face.  Like cumming?  If Sal nicks me, I'll finish him off.  So, the first thing when you shave, right, you want to lubricate the area.  A little bit of water, right?  Just a little bit of water.  Oh.  Oh, he's just pouring water all over Alan Thicke Jr.'s face.  Why the hair?  All right.  You got it.  What are you doing?  Maybe you could dab. 
[02:40:00]  Lubricating his eyebrows.  All right.  You just poured a whole bottle of water on his head.  Yeah, you poured water on his head.  Sal is enjoying this on a whole other level.  Of course.  Secondly, we want to use some shaving cream.  Because we don't want it to be, you know, too much friction.  Oh, of course not.  You got to use shaving cream.  Oh, no, no, no.  Not so...  Oh, that's much too much.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened to the shaving cream container?  It was much too much.  Right.  All right.  He's rubbing it in.  All right.  On his eyes.  Okay.  Don't cut him. 
[02:40:30]  I won't cut him.  Cut me, Mick.  Do you know how to shave eyebrows?  Me?  Bobby!  It's Bob Kelly.  Come on in, Bobby.  Come on in, Bobby.  What are you guys doing?  He's the intern.  It's Friday.  It's his last day.  It's Friday?  It's his last day.  It's Friday.  It's Friday.  And we decided, because as a kid...  Do you know as a kid, he was a little fat boy with no eyebrows?  So we're kind of reenacting the no eyebrow thing.  He's going to shave his eyebrows.  We gave him 70 bucks. 
[02:41:00]  70?  Yeah.  Not 100.  It was a tough negotiation.  You negotiated him down.  It's a tough negotiation, Bobby.  But he got excited.  He said he could buy a video game.  I want to throw $5 in the mix.  Hey, nice.  $75.  I want to even it off.  There you go.  I'm not touching you.  All right.  That's a lot of shaving cream.  Why are we...  Can I close the curtains?  Why are they closing the curtains?  Gary closed the curtains.  Wait, why?  I saw him.  He's closing them right there.  There's nothing sexual going on here.  I asked him why he's closing the curtains.  This is over.  Why is it...  It's over! 
[02:41:30]  Gary!  Gary!  Gary!  He went left.  He went left.  Gary!  He's coming.  He's coming.  Gary!  Gary!  Oh, God.  Gary!  Uh-oh.  Oh, man.  Gary!  I have the answer.  What?  He's in here with me.  Gary!  He's in the other room.  Gary!  You want the answer?  Yeah.  In case anybody doesn't want to see somebody getting shaved.  Or blood.  Or blood.  Oh, God, Gary.  Open the motherfucking curtains. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, God, Gary.  Open the fucking curtains!  That's insanity!  I have to draw a line somewhere.  Here's the line.  Oh, Gary.  No one's...  Are you kidding me?  Oh, Gary.  You do it to yourself, sir.  You do it to yourself.  There's no reason!  Oh, God.  There's no rule that has been set forth that says that people have to be protected from  someone being shaved.  What?  That's insane! 
[02:42:30]  Finish the sentence.  Oh, Gary.  From a bunch of men lying another man down and shaving his eyebrows.  And shaving his eyebrows.  And making him really live in his shitty childhood.  Yes!  It's not his pubes!  You guys are trying to help.  Fuck!  I don't understand the reasoning behind it!  This is therapeutic.  Oh, shit.  He's got...  Oh, he's got shaving cream in his eyes.  Does it burn?  Yeah.  Fuck!  Ah!  Ah!  Burns like a motherfucker!  Pour water on it!  Pour water on it!  Blinded him. 
[02:43:00]  You all right?  More water!  More water and paper towels!  Let him wipe it off!  Can we just cut to this kid sitting by his pool that he got from fucking suing you guys?  This has gone horribly wrong.  Shove the curtains.  We haven't even started shaving him yet.  Oh, no.  You all right?  Oh, no.  He's doubled over in pain.  His eyes are burning.  What are you doing?  It says keep out of eyes. 
[02:43:30]  Sal, you fucked that up.  Sorry.  How do they feel?  Better, right?  A little better?  You just trim them off.  Oh, my God.  Are you fucking high?  His eyes are really red.  Burns like a motherfucker.  Yeah.  Wipe them better.  Oh, my God.  Watch your language, dude.  Maybe that's the other one.  Watch your language.  Bobby, why are you here?  I'm coming in to do Sammy's show.  Sam's after show.  Oh, very cool.  Yeah.  And then I heard you guys shaving.  No, it's all good.  I didn't know why you were here. 
[02:44:00]  That's all.  Do one.  How red are they?  Do a little bit on your finger.  Your eyes are a little red.  Oh, my God.  Wow, that hurt.  All right, Sal.  It's like getting soap in your eyes.  Everyone's done it.  Let me put on the shaving cream.  Sal, yeah.  Let him put the shaving cream on.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  He's not comfortable.  I'm sorry.  He's not comfortable.  Close the curtains.  Fuck, dude.  I'm going to lose my eyesight now.  Unbelievable.  That's black guy shaving cream.  Well, the eyebrows are a little unruly.  That's a bubble neck.  Oh, I thought you were going to say something else.  Jesus. 
[02:44:30]  Ding, ding.  That's aloe.  Use this one.  Yeah, that's shave butter.  It's got aloe in it.  Mix this in.  It's got aloe in it.  That's not going to do the trick.  Suck that cock.  All right, is it good?  It's like a fucking wallet.  Why don't we get a mirror in here so we can see what the fuck's going on?  Because I have no idea what the hell is going on.  That's good.  All right.  Now, don't get that shit in your eyes.  Some, like, Latina chick in a pencil or anything.  Don't fucking pour any more water on his face.  Don't let it run into his eyes. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  You have to go.  Fucking lunatic.  Should we wait for the mirror?  No, let's go.  I think we're ready.  Where did you get a razor from 1962 for?  I know.  He told me to get the cheapest razor I could find.  Yeah, I had to pay for the razors, too.  So it's all right.  Oh, Jesus.  You couldn't splurge for a nice razor?  Sal, your next best one would have been $8.  18 razor blades.  It's a single-blade razor.  It's disposable.  I'll use a new one.  A single blade?  It's this, too, Sam.  This is what black guys use so they don't get bumps on their face.  Oh, man.  This doesn't do a clean shave.  We don't... 
[02:45:30]  Here.  The police supply the bumps.  You can't.  We don't have any shave club razors around.  It's fucking Billy Club.  I got it.  I think they're all spoken for.  Those are hot commodities around here.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  Hold the mirror there.  You've got to use a trimmer.  Is this going to work?  I know.  You're sitting like that.  An electric trimmer.  Please unarch your back.  It hurts, though.  Do you know you're not getting it with the first pass?  No, I'm going to do it in steps.  You've got to go.  Very lightly.  Go down quick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Here we go.  My fingers are all right, because no one's behind me.  Okay.  Close the curtains for shaving. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Here we go.  We're shaving Alan's eyebrows on his last day here with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's coming off pretty easily.  A nice swath just came off there.  Gently.  Gently.  Very gentle.  Is it cold water or hot water?  Close that eye.  It's cold.  He went with cold water.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  That is coming off nicely.  Oh, it is coming off.  All right.  All right.  I think it was fake.  Yeah, right?  It just came right off.  It's coming off like it was irradiated.  Oh, my God.  It's coming off really good.  Oh, my God. 
[02:46:30]  Why is he doing this?  It's only two little strips of hair that in no way really affect your look.  So it's...  That'll be all right.  Uncle Leo eyebrows.  That'd be great.  Why are you so angry?  You look angry.  You need your eyebrows.  That's like a vagina with no legs.  That's the tough part because it's kind of angled in there.  Yeah.  Well, pull it up with your thumb, dummy.  You pull like that.  Yeah, see? 
[02:47:00]  Fucking A.  Would you do this before?  Jesus.  The eyebrow's just about gone.  Oh, my God.  That one's gone.  You just do one.  All right.  Good.  Is it totally gone?  His eyebrow's gone.  It really...  Boy, that really makes a difference on someone.  Let's look.  Oh, my God.  You look like a fucker.  That's good.  That looks bad.  No.  No, that's fine.  Let's do the other one.  You put your hair over it.  No one will know.  You don't want to look like you're going home.  Alan, what do you think, Alan?  What do you think?  I mean, if I furrow my eyebrow, it's not too bad. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, it's like shadows.  Just walk around with an angry look on my face.  Yeah.  Of course you'll be angry.  You have no eyebrows.  Just get a red mask.  All right.  All right.  Lean back.  Get the other one.  Come on, Sal.  To be fair, I'm starting a new razor.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice of you.  That's nice.  He's going on the other side now and eliminating eyebrow number two.  I want to throw two more dolls into the mix.  You know what, though?  You know what, though?  70, 70, 70.  This will just end up being a hipster look.  So what?  I shaved my eyebrows and I'm wearing a top hat. 
[02:48:00]  What the fuck?  I'm a hipster.  All right, here we go.  Yeah, and fucking scuba flippers walking down the street.  I have a Hello Kitty backpack and a top hat.  Yeah, look at me.  And a bolo tie.  All the Japanese kids will be doing it next week.  Yeah.  Very hippie American look.  Second eyebrow.  Second eyebrow.  My mom's going to be so pissed.  Your mom, you're thinking of your mom.  She's been pissed.  Remember when you were that age when the first thing that you thought of  was like, what is your mom going to think?  Yeah.  Who cares what she thinks? 
[02:48:30]  I know, right?  That just goes away after a few years.  You're just like, who cares?  Especially if your mom dies.  Yeah, that too.  Oops.  Oops.  What happened?  You're apologizing.  What?  Second eyebrow coming off easy.  You're not getting it as close as easy as that last one.  Make sure you...  Do a little more shade.  Oh, shit.  Watch your eye.  Don't squint your eye, dummy.  Put it up high and push it in.  Don't squint your eye.  Now rub it in.  There you go.  Good.  You're good.  You're good.  You're good.  Oh, boy.  Look, it's in the corner of his eye.  Would you wipe that out of the corner of his eye? 
[02:49:00]  You guys are assholes.  I love that you're making Sal nervous.  I know.  I'm trying to make him nervous with the eyebrow.  Yeah.  Get that piece right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I think there's a Tumblr with celebrities without eyebrows.  Oh, yeah?  Take the word celebrity out and you'll be on it.  Yeah, what do you think?  Why do you think you fit in that?  You're just...  Find one with douchebags in an eye.  I just remembered how fucking weird they looked.  This is a bad idea.  Celebrity shave people's eyebrows off.  You're missing the shaving cream over there. 
[02:49:30]  It's right in his eye socket.  What's the matter with you?  There you go, Mars.  He's been wearing cum out of little boy's eyes.  You see that thumb scoop?  Yeah, it was a good thumb sweep.  I'll tell you, Daddy.  Jesus.  That Mars just did.  All right.  Let's see the big unveiling.  All right, show him my...  Wipe your eyes.  Look...  Oh, boy.  Oh, fuck.  I look like a psychopath.  Oh, no.  You look the exact same.  The neurosis fits.  Al.  Nothing looks different on you.  Al, look up here. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  It's not that bad.  I've seen people...  I've seen those guys that are in the prison in, like, Signs of the Lambs.  You know, the guy who, like, throws the cum.  Multiple Migs.  God damn.  Yeah.  It looks terrible.  Maybe, you know, I've seen people that have looked worse with no eyebrows.  Yeah, I've seen people that look better with eyebrows.  Well, true.  Yeah.  Thanks, Mark.  It still looks like he has eyebrows for some weird reason.  Can we open up the hallway now and let people walk by?  Because I don't know what shock they would have gotten from that.  From that.  That shocking shaving of eyebrows. 
[02:50:30]  I don't think we're done.  What's the curtains on?  I don't think we're done.  Oh, shit.  I got 20 more dollars.  Oh.  Ant's got 20 more dollars.  What are you looking at?  What do you want to do?  Bobby's got nothing.  I got a baby coming.  Nothing.  I got seven bucks was mine.  A baby.  All right.  What do you want to do?  Oh, we want to paint in new eyebrows.  With what?  With a Sharpie.  Sharpie and some...  With Sharpie.  Can we paint in new eyebrows?  Let me see what I got.  Oh, fuck.  Can I go for it?  Why not?  All right.  We're going to paint in new eyebrows.  All right.  I got a 20.  I'll close you to 20.  So, but what eyebrows? 
[02:51:00]  Can we look at eyebrows online?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're going to like...  What kind of eyebrows?  You got to do the Latin lady.  Do you remember when Steve shaved his eyebrows off?  Steve.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Steve C., of course.  But nobody asked him to.  He just did it on his own.  No, he just one day.  I think he said I was trying to even them up and they got carried away.  Give like...  I think so.  We need to...  We want some nice expression.  Put in celebrity eyebrows.  You should do like the Groucho Marx.  I want to see celebrities. 
[02:51:30]  No.  Oh, wow.  We want like some kind of like...  Hispanic...  Hispanic women?  Like Jack Nicholson or something?  Go with surprise eyebrows.  Something like that.  Let's see what...  It should be...  Wait, wait, wait.  It should be different.  Like he's constantly going, huh?  Right, right, right.  Like the Spock, you know, where the Spock goes...  The Spock goes fascinating.  Yeah, yeah.  Give him the people's eyebrow.  But should it be thick?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I say we go where they're a little too high because it looks like he's doing this thing.  Yes.  A little too high. 
[02:52:00]  You know what I mean?  Yes.  Too high.  Not where the eyebrows used to be.  I want to go higher so it looks like he's making this face all the time.  Right, huh?  But still inquisitive.  Yes.  Yes.  But can we get a little angle to it too?  What else can we add?  Yeah.  Okay.  One a little higher than the other and with a sharp like this.  Wham, wham.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, so he's going, hmm.  All right, we've got to find him online so we don't fuck this up. 
[02:52:30]  What about like the people's eyebrow?  Yeah.  People's eyebrow or Spock.  Yeah, so we're going to draw new eyebrows onto you, Alan.  Okay.  I suggest we make him a little high so he's in that constant, huh?  Huh?  And what do you suggest, Alan?  Yeah, I think very high.  Yeah.  One, though, a little higher than the other.  Okay.  And kind of at an angle so he looks like he's going, fascinating.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  We want to make a fascinating slash huh? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Eyebrow look on you.  Okay.  And above where his real eyebrows would be.  I'm doing this?  I don't know.  Who's the artist?  Who's the good artist?  I'm so hard.  I can't do this.  Bobby!  Bobby's good.  Bobby, you're good?  Bobby's good at this.  Are you cool with this?  You're a good artist?  Bobby just fell off the console.  Who ruined this moment with a fart?  That wasn't me.  Jesus, Bobby.  I had a protein shake.  Oh, God.  Would you drink it out of a dead rat? 
[02:53:30]  Fuck.  It's terrible.  All right.  Yeah, you can do it, Bobby.  You should do a silver one, too.  Is this thing on?  Got to be black.  Black?  Got to show up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Silver first.  Got to show up.  Me, me, me, me.  All right.  Bobby?  Bobby.  Hold on, Bobby.  What do you got?  So you're going to paint the eyebrows on, right?  Yeah, well, I went to art school.  I was going to be an artist before.  Were you?  All right.  I was going to be a comedian.  Well, can you do it on a piece of paper?  Oh, good idea.  Yeah, a little practice first. 
[02:54:00]  Okay, what are you going to do?  Now, draw his eyes first.  Show where his eyes are.  I want to have the...  Okay.  So that's his eyes.  That's his eyes.  Okay.  All right, all right.  All right.  You could have been an artist.  Oh, wow.  Okay, so what we want to do, we want to have one up, right?  Yeah.  And one like that, correct?  Yeah, but this one a little higher.  Higher, though, than it's supposed to be.  You want to go above...  How about you go over here, so we're going to go over here.  Yes!  Yes, yes.  What we want to do...  And you're going to feather it in.  We're going to feather it in.  Yes! 
[02:54:30]  Right?  We're going to do some micro-feathering.  Micro-feathering.  You might know about, Anthony.  One follicle at a time.  All right, very good.  In the natural direction the hair grows.  All right.  I'm going to do what I'm going to do.  He'll look constantly surprised.  How are you cool with that?  And you'll look more inquisitive.  It's better than walking around looking like this.  You'll look more inquisitive than surprised.  Yes.  Yes, I'll do it.  All right, so...  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  There you go.  Now, where to start, Bob?  Point out on him. 
[02:55:00]  Go with the easy one.  Go with the easy one first.  All right, lie back.  Where are you going to start?  I'll wipe this jizz off.  I don't want to get jizzed.  Above...  See where his real eyebrow is?  Right.  Go above that.  Yes, yes.  But not so high where it looks like a...  Hold on, hold on, Bobby.  Don't make it look like a forehead wrinkle.  This is his real eyebrow right here.  Right above the real eyebrow.  We want it...  What I'm going to do first is draw it in and then feather it.  Right, right.  Okay, so we're going to go...  We're going to go right...  We want to go...  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Okay, now...  That's good.  That's good.  Now, what do I want to do?  I want to come this way.  Oh, now you put the little individual hairs in.  Oh, Bobby, this is great.  You should open a business for Hispanic ladies that shave their eyebrows off and just draw  it in with a pencil.  What the fuck are they thinking?  Don't laugh at that.  Sorry, sorry.  I have to get a new eyebrow pencil.  What happened?  What happened?  On my new eyebrow pencil?  Wake up next day, they look like clowns. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, it's terrible.  Why do they decide to take all their eyebrows out?  Let's get a light on this subject.  Captain Carl, I swear I'm so misadvanted.  She takes all her eyebrows.  She plucks them all out.  She plucks them all out.  Then she draws it into it.  She goes...  Bobby doing a great job.  Yeah, yeah.  Feathering in a realistic sharpie eyebrow above the point on Alan Thicke Jr. where his eyebrow  formally resided.  They were removed by Sal with a blunt razor blade for the sum of about 75 bucks, which 
[02:56:30]  he said he's going to spend on video games.  I think that's about done.  You want to leave me?  Let me see.  Look up.  Look up.  That's pretty good.  Okay.  That's pretty good.  Now the next one.  Oh, it works like an eyebrow.  It's actually moving.  Now the next one's got to be higher, Bobby, and arched more. 
[02:57:00]  Arched.  It's got to get like an arch like he's going, hmm.  Yeah, so we're going to go...  Like when Spock looks and goes, fascinating.  I want you to do that for me.  Bring this eyebrow up.  Just one.  Oh, you probably can't do it with that side.  Here we go.  I got it.  You can only do it one.  Oh, a little higher.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Let me see.  Look up.  Look up.  It's good.  Right?  Feather to the top, Bob, to make it a little higher.  Like use the feathering to make it even a little higher. 
[02:57:30]  Bobby was so good at this.  This is perfect.  He's found his strong suit right here.  I do want to say during this short time that we have to do this,  that Bob Kelly is at the brokerage in Belmore tonight.  Nice.  Bobby Kelly.  You going?  He's going to be down there.  I can't make it tonight.  No.  But you know who else is going to be down there?  My buddy, Joe Curry. 
[02:58:00]  Joe Curry is going to be down there with you, Bobby.  So say hi to my pal.  Who's Joe Curry?  You know Joe Curry.  You've seen Joe Curry.  You know Joe Curry.  Now he's going to be all like, oh, man.  I know Joe.  Bobby didn't know me.  I love Joe Curry.  Jesus.  Joe Curry is a great guy.  We used to do stuff to Joe just like this when he was asleep at parties.  We'd draw things on him.  We'd tie his shoelaces together, turn the lights out, and then call him.  What do you think, Bobby?  I think, um...  What? 
[02:58:30]  What do you think?  It's terrible.  What do you think, Bobby?  I think, well, look at me.  Turn this way, yeah.  Turn this way.  Ask me if I like pancakes.  Do you like pancakes?  It doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  Raise your eyebrow.  Which one?  The other one.  You can't.  You raise that eyebrow, don't you?  Yeah.  This is the eyebrow.  Let me see.  Turn this way.  Now, just relax.  Holy shit.  You've got to walk around like that.  Look at me.  It's pretty cool.  That's what you've got to do right there. 
[02:59:00]  It's pretty cool.  You really look like...  Which isn't at all.  The rock.  We gave you the rock.  Al, look right in the camera.  I like it.  What do you think, Ope?  I like it.  I like it, too.  I like it a lot.  Maybe we should do a mistake.  Who has a tattoo?  A tattoo gun.  No?  What?  Close the curtains.  Holy shit.  It's curtains for you, see?  Curtains for all of you.  Fucking close the curtains.  There you go.  All right.  Where do you have to go right after the show today?  Luckily, today I don't have anything to do. 
[02:59:30]  Nothing?  No, so I'll just hide in my room.  But how are you getting home?  Taking the bus.  Oh, so you've got to take the bus like that.  Up to the Bronx.  Well, they won't fuck with crazy white boys.  Oh, no.  I just saw it in the...  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Let me see.  What happened?  What's wrong?  What?  You haven't seen the mirror yet?  I haven't seen the eyebrows.  I just want to see...  Like, I kind of saw...  Oh, you want to see the eyebrows?  I want to see the eyebrows.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's great.  That's terrible.  You're going to have a video game.  I look like a transvestite.  You do a little bit.  Oh, my God. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You do look a little tranny-like.  Do you look like a tranny-like?  I do.  Do we have a wig?  I look like that chick that waits on the bus with me in the morning.  Oh.  Do we have a wig?  Oh, my God.  You look like a tranny that has a question.  Yes, a very inquisitive tranny.  Don't give me a fucking wig.  What should I do with my cock?  I don't look in the wig.  Should I tape it down?  Hmm.  What should I do with my dick and balls?  Should I let this little thin ball man shit on my chest?  Hmm.  Hmm.  I think you look good, dude.  No, thank you.  You're lucky I did it.  Yeah, no, I'm glad you did it. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Looks great, Alan.  Yeah, good job.  And, wait a minute.  Fucking own it, Alan.  Own it.  Let's look at my artwork.  Wow, that's a good...  Yeah, you really did nail it, Bobby.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Bravo.  Take your money.  There you go.  Now, get out of here, whore.  Oh, my God.  I did whore myself, didn't I?  A little bit.  But, you know, it's your last day.  You're an intern.  All right.  You know, you... 
[03:01:00]  Come here, dude.  You manned up.  You manned up for it.  Oh, you got your shaving cream all over the back of your shirt.  Oh, my God.  It's on your back.  Yo, Bob Saget.  Hi, Bob Saget.  Yo, Bob Saget.  Yo.  Sorry, we're late getting to you.  All right, business is business.  You had to shave an intern's eyebrows on.  Yeah, he had to be hazed in old radio-style school fashion.  That's right, Bob.  You know, like, whoa, look at what we just did.  We shaved our intern's eyebrows.  It's crazy.  We gave him the Spock eyebrow, though. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, we gave him the one.  We've got a new intern after this, doesn't it?  Don't they hear what happened to this one?  They don't seem to care.  Yeah, they just love that we give them attention.  Yeah, any kind of attention.  They love it.  You should just take off body parts off the next guy.  Maybe that is where we're going to head.  Maybe that's the direction we're heading.  We threw it away.  We're like, can we shave your eyebrows?  And he goes, well, I'm not going to do it unless I get paid.  We're like $20.  He goes, all right.  Aw, that's just sad, man.  And then we ended up giving him $75.  Silver Sharpie or Black Sharpie? 
[03:02:00]  Black Sharpie.  Black.  Right.  All in.  All in with the Black Sharpie.  So we shaved the eyebrows, and then we gave him new ones.  And Bobby Kelly did the artwork?  Yeah, Bobby did a great job.  Bob Saget was listening.  Yes.  Yeah, I'm into the whole thing.  Very cool.  Bob did a great job.  He's, of course, at the brokerage.  I'm proud of you guys.  You sent that kid out in the world to know that something's wrong with him.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Other people are going to think he came from a RuPaul job or something.  He really does look like a tranny.  He does.  It's amazing.  Where are you calling from right now, Mr. Saget? 
[03:02:30]  I'm in LA.  And then, yeah, I'm on the view in a couple hours.  It's confusing.  That's like a cross-dressing thing, too, because you go there and then you come back.  So they did it early.  But I came on here to promote New York.  Are you in New York?  I was in New York a couple days ago.  Oh, so they taped it.  They taped the segment.  And it's going to be on the view today at 11, 11-ish?  Yeah, whenever it's on there.  Did you get Barbara Walters, too, or what?  Did she get Barbara Walters and Whoopi and Joy?  Oh, the whole gang was there for you.  Oh, look at you.  And Steve Sharippa, which is fun. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, right.  Steve Sharippa.  And what's her name?  Bobby.  Wasn't there Elizabeth?  Because I think she's in love with me.  She keeps avoiding me every time I go there.  She can't even face you.  I don't think so.  I think the religious thing for her is like Tower of Babel in bed.  She doesn't know what to do.  Oh, Tower of Babel.  That's right.  And where are you going to be?  Are you performing, sir?  Well, I'm promoting my special tonight.  It's on, my new special premieres on Showtime at 10 o'clock tonight.  10 o'clock tonight, Showtime, new special. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  It's like four years since the last one, or even more.  Has it been that long?  Wow.  And I did the whole thing.  I shaved off my eyebrows and Sharpie penned my face on.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good idea.  The whole thing.  I'd like, I would like to see that, as a matter of fact.  How are you guys doing?  Not too shabby.  We're busy, yeah.  You know, we're waking up early, pumping out quality programming, and then going home  and basking in our own shame.  No, but you've got your women, so you kind of forget about the shame, right? 
[03:04:00]  Well, that's true.  When, you know, they aren't ashamed.  When they're not ashamed, right?  Yeah, yeah.  People are laughing at Alan outside the studio.  He's getting some crazy looks.  Bob really put some drastically over-the-top eyebrows on.  Like, it's very caricature eyebrows.  Yes, we were hoping for something a little subtle.  Something a little more subtle, but no, they're so big and ridiculous.  Like half an inch thick.  Yeah, yeah.  They're very thick and very long, like from the nose to the side of his face. 
[03:04:30]  Well, can you scrub it off?  Is he going to get some kind of chemical, like nail polish remover to try to take it off?  Good luck.  I hope his skin oil, because he never showers, I hope his filthy skin oil reacts with the Sharpie,  and it permanently embeds itself in his skin.  Yeah, Sharpies don't come off too easily.  No, they don't.  His head is not shaved, right?  No.  Well, we probably could shave his head.  If he shaved his head, and then he tries to get that stuff off with a nail polish remover,  he's going to look like the star of Powder, that movie Powder.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:05:00]  He's going to have pink.  He's going to look like sore and rub.  No matter what, he looks like he was abused.  You've got to see the looks he's getting in the hallway.  Yeah.  It's terrific.  It's just terrible.  The hallway is not a good representation of the rest of the world, so the kid's screwed over, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got to, like, live his life now.  Yeah, he's a weird dude.  And I think he's got an interview to be an intern over at Rockstar Games, so what is he going to do?  Go over there looking like that?  Maybe over there.  I mean, if it looks like a restaurant.  You know what's going to happen?  Danny's going to say, you know, we don't need a fucking guy like that looking like a fucking asshole here. 
[03:05:30]  And they're going to go, yeah.  Fucking.  Oh, gosh.  Well, at least it's not like tattoos.  He could get it tattooed over there.  Yeah.  Bobby's coming back in studio.  Bob Kelly.  What kind of reaction is he getting out there?  We sit.  It's a lady in the booth just showing a scream.  Really?  It's not.  We were just commenting on how it's not subtle, Bob.  You went over the top.  You went over the top.  Caricature eyebrows.  But I thought that's what you wanted. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, it was great.  I didn't have my tools of the trade.  We were hoping for something a little more subtle.  Just a little more subtle.  I needed a finer marker to do if you wanted me to do real life detail work.  Hey, Bob Saget.  How you doing, man?  Hi.  Hey, I didn't know you were drawing.  Hey, is it Bob?  Yeah, it's Bob Saget.  I just put the headphones on.  Hi, Bobby.  Bob's one of my favorites.  Hey, Bobby.  Hi, Bob.  How you doing?  I'm good.  So in addition to stand-up, you've drawn on people's faces?  Yeah.  Well, you've got to have a B plan.  That's what my mother told me. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  So it's a trade.  Yeah, I used to do it with little kids in a park, but I can't do that anymore, so I went  to comedy.  Which would be hilarious.  You just fucking take some kid in the park when his parents are not looking to draw weird  eyebrows on him.  How insanely fucking pissed would they be?  You know a kid would love it.  You'd have a line of kids.  Oh, the kid would be laughing, but his parents would be, who did this to you?  Remember when I was a kid, they used to have the park, and they'd do the face paintings,  and they'd as kiss?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I got the cat.  Who's the cat?  Peter?  Peter Criss.  Yeah, Peter Criss.  Got the Peter Criss. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Why didn't you go with the fucking...  Because I saw the star, and the girl was a little stupid.  She didn't make the star right, so she was just like an idiot.  Oh, so you're like fucking...  Yeah, you look like a little fat clown instead of Paul Stanley.  Yeah, yeah.  She couldn't do the star properly.  Fucked up on the star.  It's hard to make a star if you think about it.  A perfect star it is.  It's not easy.  Unless you're Jewish.  Well, that's an easy one.  Two triangles.  Bob Saget?  Yeah.  You can feel that one.  Yeah, I got the whole star, Dave, in the middle of my head with a Sharpie. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, very good.  Nice look.  Nice look.  I think everybody should be marked with what they are.  Sure.  At least it doesn't leave us all guessing out in the streets who to hate, you know.  Exactly.  Now, everyone's taking pictures of Alan.  He should charge.  He's a broke college kid.  He's got a lot more money now.  Should he leave the building?  Charge $5.  $5 a fucking picture.  He made $75 for shaving the eyebrows.  And how much did he make for the new eyebrows?  Like $20.  I gave him $20 alone.  I promised him $20, but he forgot already.  Oh.  But he forgot. 
[03:08:00]  You're a millionaire, you Welch.  What's wrong with you?  You just painted on a kid's face.  He forgot.  You didn't give him anything, and you did the painting.  I gave him $8.  And I did my art for free.  Yeah, and he's got a baby coming.  Good point.  I donated my art.  Bob's going to be a daddy, Bob.  Really?  Yes.  Do you know who the woman is?  No, I don't.  I don't know who the father is, either.  Oh.  You know, when a kid is born, as soon as it comes out, it's a great time to take a Sharpie  and let it know who it is.  That's true. 
[03:08:30]  That's what I'm going on doing.  I'm going to draw pubic hair on his pee-pee.  Oh, gosh.  People look in that little nursery room and just see.  I'm going to give him a huge bush fat.  Jesus.  If it's a giant penis, you could put drop shadow on it.  Drop shadow.  Yeah.  That'll look great.  I'm going to mush his penis in and then draw a vagina down his balls.  Sliver.  Oh, you know what?  Bob.  I'd like to stay and talk longer, but I...  Yeah, yeah.  What the hell, Bob?  It was the mush of his penis in by his vagina.  What are you, trying to clean up your act all of a sudden? 
[03:09:00]  No, no.  I just actually have to go.  Oh.  He's a very busy man.  All right, Bob Saget.  When I was there, I would never be offended by that.  Exactly.  It felt like a funny place to have to go.  I know the reason you're calling.  You're hitting the road again.  It's bobsaget.com for tickets.  No, no, no.  It's my special on Showtime.  It's special.  What about...  Well, we were also told that you were hitting the road, too.  A little bit, yeah.  A little bit.  There's places near you.  A couple places.  A hipster places or something.  Bob has a special tonight?  Is it tonight?  Special tonight on Showtime.  What time is it at? 
[03:09:30]  It's on at 10 o'clock.  10 o'clock East Coast?  Yeah.  9 o'clock whatever time.  I don't know who lives at 9 o'clock.  Yeah, really?  The 10 o'clock I believe in.  I actually have a 10 written on my head today.  Oh, very good.  That's very good.  Where did you film the special?  At the Moore Theater in Seattle.  That's great.  That's a great place.  They told me that Helen Keller played there.  I said, well, I hope I do better.  Yeah, really?  Oof.  I guess it was like Jeff Dunham, you know?  All right, bobsaget.com.  All right, I love you guys.  I want to see you when I see you. 
[03:10:00]  And then I laugh and draw on.  Yes.  Oh, you mean the next time you're in New York, you'll stop by?  Well, I couldn't.  I was just seeing my daughter.  I was just fucking with you.  No, I care about you.  My daughter's just trumped you.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's true.  It's all good.  We'll see you when we see you.  All right, Bob.  All right, Bobby.  Have a good one.  Thanks.  Bob Saget, everyone.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  You know that.  Bob.  And Bob Kelly.  Yeah, Bob Kelly.  Came through strong, kid.  Oh, yeah.  Swoofed in here with his eyebrow art. 
[03:10:30]  Eyebrow art.  Amazing.  Where's Alan?  Let's get Alan in here one more time before we pack it up for the week.  Because he's done as an intern.  This is his last day as an intern.  That's the way to go out with eyebrows.  And he's supposedly going over to Rockstar Video Games to try to...  What is that?  Everybody?  I know, right?  How many people do they need?  I can't wait till you guys are over there.  Oh, God.  Doing voices.  Oh, shit.  Bang, bang.  You're fighting me.  Hey, I've got to tell you.  No, I'll kill a hooker.  Oh, shoot.  The girl interns were freaking out just now.  The what? 
[03:11:00]  There's a couple of girl interns here and they were freaking out.  In a good way?  No.  They were like, you look terrible.  Of course you do.  You have no eyebrows for real.  And you have fake bad ones drawn in.  Yeah, I know.  Did they like you or something at first?  No, no, no.  I mean, I didn't even know they went out together.  Like, I was listening to them talk while they were freaking out.  And they're like, oh, you're going out tonight?  And it's like, oh, fuck.  People do that here?  Like, oh, wait.  The other interns are friends with each other.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I don't understand.  You seem like a nice guy.  I don't know why everybody doesn't like you. 
[03:11:30]  No, we like him.  We just think he's a little strange.  He's a little off.  Yeah, but I like, don't you like strange?  Yes.  We're not saying we don't like him.  We actually like him.  Well, like he's strange like he works in a chocolate factory, strange?  Yeah, yeah.  You look like Marilyn Manson, I think.  Oh, a little bit right there.  A little Marilyn Manson.  It's not a bad look.  Well, it's the no eyebrows.  Anyone that shaves their eyebrows will look like Marilyn Manson.  Sure.  You know, you're lucky you're in New York.  Like, this show isn't in Miami.  That's right.  You have a hard time.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, New York, nobody's going to even acknowledge you.  Or the Midwest somewhere. 
[03:12:00]  If I was back home, I'd get my ass kicked, like, immediately.  Why?  Texas.  They're, as they say, not very good with, what, gay people?  You could say that.  Are you gay?  No.  No.  But he looks gay now.  I look gay.  I get hit on by gay guys a lot.  I've been assed out by so many gay men in my life.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, I actually, I still have, like, this, like, 65-year-old gay guy friend.  It's weird.  What's wrong?  You know what?  Yeah.  It's weird.  What are you?  What are you, Brendan Fraser? 
[03:12:30]  What the fuck?  I don't know.  Like, I just thought gay guys like me.  I don't know why.  Yeah?  Someone told me I had a gay face one time.  Maybe it's your blowjobs.  I was going to say, yeah.  You shouldn't have sucked the guy's dick.  Maybe it's the way you softly talk and cup the balls.  Did you ever, have you ever been with a guy?  No, no.  Look at me.  Honestly, God, let me tell you something.  Who gives a shit?  I'm asking you, honestly, have you ever been with a dude?  By just fucking around, mistake, one night, hanging out.  Maybe you're kidding around, like Richard Joe Buttlicker. 
[03:13:00]  I've never had the desire to be with a man.  And when the gay off happened, that was the day I knew for sure that I was straight.  Because I felt like vomiting.  Because the taste of cock was just terrible for him.  I felt like vomiting the entire time I was watching it.  But that means you weren't sure?  Well, no.  It's one of these things where it's like, I always knew.  He finally, you know what I mean?  Yeah, I didn't need that.  Think about it.  Right, I didn't need that.  It was that day.  You don't know anything.  You don't know anything for sure unless you're exposed to it, right?  I was not the first time I was ever exposed to something gay.  You don't have to put a plate full of shit with a fork in it in front of me. 
[03:13:30]  It's right at this moment I realized I don't want to eat shit.  See, you just kind of know.  Well, I never really, I never wanted to do anything gay, like ever.  It's hard to take you seriously.  Till.  Yeah, I know.  Your eyebrows are ridiculous.  It's bad.  Stop yelling at me.  I'm sorry.  How are you going to get the Sharpie off?  Sharpie doesn't come off easy.  Nah, I'm probably just standing.  Doesn't come off too easy.  I'll just probably stand under hot water and just start scrubbing.  But you hate showers.  I know.  Oh, man. 
[03:14:00]  This might give him an excuse to clean himself.  You can get that off.  You go to Dwayne Reed, go to the pharmacy.  Get some alcohol or something?  Just go, no, are you out of your mind?  Go to the pharmacy and it's not a knife wound.  Go to the pharmacy and ask the pharmacist, how do you get this off?  Put a videotaping.  Yeah, yeah, you got it.  Please.  Seriously, ask her and she'll be like, look, get this and that and it'll come right off.  It's Sharpie.  How do I get it off of me?  Yeah.  This is New York.  This is not the first time somebody walked in with something on their face.  How do I get this off?  Alan, move your hair away.  Let me get a shot of this. 
[03:14:30]  Everyone else got their fucking pictures.  Hold on.  It looks good in a photo.  Hold on, don't move.  Does it look good in a photo?  In a photo, it looks great.  Let me see.  It does not look bad.  In a photo, it does not look bad.  Oh, Jesus.  In a photo.  Oh, you're falling, you're dropping.  I'm sick, Bobby.  Why is it?  It looks terrible.  I just got stupid allergies, man.  Oh, yeah, I got it.  They're driving me insane.  Hey, you know what I was thinking didn't pop up this spring?  The cum trees. 
[03:15:00]  They did.  Oh, they came.  I have two cum trees in my front yard.  Oh, they came, all right.  They never really bloomed into those big softball sides.  How old are they?  Eighteen?  Cum tree.  Hey, you cum tree.  You have two chicks out front in panties holding up a lantern.  Yes, you cum tree.  Cum tree, get in here.  They never had the big softball-sized puff things that stink.  Never happened.  They got little flowers, but then they fell off.  It wasn't too cum-y, but it was a little cum-y.  Yeah, a little cum-y this year.  It was cum-y. 
[03:15:30]  It was definitely cum-y.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I didn't smell no cum tree.  Jizzies.  Yeah.  The jizz tree.  Ugh.  So when's your interview with Rockstar?  It happened already.  It was on Tuesday.  Oh, okay.  You got the job?  They'll let me know.  They said, give us a week or two.  Oh, boy.  Hopefully the eyebrows will go in.  And that's for an internship, right?  Not a job.  Internship.  Everybody's over there, right?  Oh, my God.  It's everybody.  Everybody.  Danny.  D-Boy.  Yeah.  Than.  Than.  Than was the first.  Yeah.  Then D-Boy.  Mm-hmm.  After Than's failed comedy career. 
[03:16:00]  He left here to become a stand-up comic, if you recall.  Wow.  Than back in the day.  He had a baby, too.  And then he, well.  Then he got married.  Yeah.  And then he really needed a real job.  Well, yeah.  Rockstar.  And then D-Boy.  Derek.  Danny.  And now the illustrious Alan Thicke Jr. and his fake eyebrows.  What if they call you like, look, we need you right now.  Can you get in here?  I would immediately shit my pants.  Yeah.  This.  It would be.  That would be a good look. 
[03:16:30]  The eyebrows and the shit in your pants.  Have you ever been there, though?  This would fit right in at Rockstar.  It really would, yeah.  They're very loose.  Lazzo would be like, I like it, man.  They're loosey-goosey.  I like it.  Yeah, I'm going to incorporate that into the game.  Yeah, man.  You could be a guy that gets run over 80 times and you've got goofy eyebrows.  Hang on, let me fix my ponytail.  Hang on.  He doesn't have a ponytail no more.  Oh, he shaved his head.  He did?  Oh, yeah.  On his 40th birthday.  He looks good.  That's great.  He shaved his head.  He looks good.  Lazzo's a good-looking guy.  Oh.  Well.  You have a look connection.  I'm not going to shave my eyebrows and paint one on, but. 
[03:17:00]  Love it.  Yeah.  Love it.  All right.  Well, I tweeted the picture of Alan without fucking eyebrows.  That's right.  You want to put up a side-by-side comparison with.  Oh, yeah.  With Spock?  With the child.  Or with Spock, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, everybody, please remember, uh, Bobby Kelly's at the brokerage in Belmore.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Tonight.  Uh, my last gig until I have the baby. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Along with, uh, Joe Curry.  My friend Joe Curry is down there, so say hi to Joe.  Yeah.  Say hi to Joe.  Joey.  How many weeks out?  Three weeks.  Wow.  Three weeks.  Three days.  Fucking weeks.  They usually go late, though.  Yeah, but I'm going.  I'm late.  What's your due date?  June 2nd.  June 2nd.  And I'm going to go with June...  8th.  5th?  Write it down.  I'll let you name the baby if it comes on the face.  Jesus.  The baby.  The baby.  The baby.  Do you have names picked out?  He's already got a name.  He's got a good one.  He's got a strong name. 
[03:18:00]  Strong name.  Really?  Yes, he does.  Yeah.  If he's not famous, he's an asshole.  If he's not famous, he's going to be, like, just an agent.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of those old-time Jewy agents.  That's the name he has.  Yeah.  It's either the shit, like, this summer.  Powers Booth?  No.  No?  Close.  Powers Booth.  Max Power.  Think Gladiator.  Maximilian?  Oh, okay.  He went Gladiator.  Maximilian?  Maximus.  He wasn't in...  Maximus.  He wasn't in...  He went Gladiator.  He went with a Gladiator. 
[03:18:30]  Son of a retarded father.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've got to do live reads.  All right.  Oh, God.  Pay the bills, boys.  How many we got?  Yeah.  Four.  Four.  Jesus.  Four.  Bob Kelly's going to continue with Sam Roberts in a few minutes here.  Yes.  The after show.  The Bob and Sam show.  Oh, that's right.  Actually, it's the Bob Who Kid and Sam show today.  Oh, the Who Kid's coming in?  Is Who Kid coming in?  Yeah, but I don't think I get third billing. 
[03:19:00]  That motherfucker is worldwide Who Kid.  I look at his fucking tweets and shit.  He's like, yeah, Dubai.  Yeah, I'm in fucking Phuket.  Yeah.  He's like, here's some fucking Indian moisture.  He's one of those guys that walks through the rain and it doesn't hit him.  He just right through the raindrops.  Yeah.  He's on the N-Word Bond tour.  Is that what it's called?  Nigga Bond.  Nigga Bond.  Nigga Bond tour.  All right.  It's like James Bond.  Nigga Bond.  Right.  He's a good guy.  Oh, Alan, your picture's getting some clicks, brother. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, damn.  They're saying, how humiliating.  Oh, it is humiliating.  Yeah, no, it's terrible.  It's pretty bad.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Well, well, well.  Are we back?  Oh, yeah.  Did you make it red?  Oh, yeah.  My friends are here.  Robert Kelly, DJ Who Kid. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  What up, sir?  The Bob, Who Kid, and Sam show.  No, I think, I don't know if I agreed to have a third villain.  Sam, Sam.  I don't remember that ever happened.  What was the original name again?  Damn.  SBW.  Sam, Bob, and Who Kid.  SBW sounds better.  SBW?  I like SBW.  Yeah.  I'll take second.  SBW sounds better.  What do you think, Who Kid?  I was going to get the pieces for us.  Get some chains and shit.  Some jewelry.  Oh, we're going to get some chains?  Some ice.  I like it.  Let's get some, I like some bling.  So, Who Kid.  I want a three-knuckle ring. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, you want that?  Oh, yeah.  I want the SBW three-knuckle ring.  But can't the cops arrest you?  I asked Who Kid because he would know about getting arrested.  I guess that sounds racist.  I'm good at that.  Can't the cops arrest you for having a three-knuckle ring like it's a weapon?  I know if you have brass knuckles on, they can arrest you.  I know if you have like a 5XT, like you look like you're in hip-hop.  Is that what it is?  You're going to just have a big t-shirt on.  I don't like you with a cold.  I don't like you with a deep voice.  I was experimenting with it a little bit yesterday.  I don't like your deep voice.  I like little squeaky sand voice. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, the gay hijack.  Yeah.  This is a little more broadcast friendly, I feel like.  I don't like it.  No?  No.  It's not like it's shit.  Why would you say that?  Like, what good does that do anyone?  Is that what happens when you eat shit?  You sound like you ate shit.  You ate a lot of shit yesterday, man.  Where's Intern Allen?  He's hiding.  Why'd you do that to that guy, man?  Who could walk?  Go find an Intern Allen.  He's probably crying in a urinal.  Who could walk in just as all the debauchery had happened.  Intern Allen was sitting here with no eyebrows.  And you know I love white people, man. 
[03:21:30]  You guys are terrible.  With fake eyebrows.  It takes a lot for who could to say a bad thing about a white person.  Really?  He loves white people?  You love white people?  He is a white person.  Since I became white.  Oh, you're white now?  I've learned to love the white moisture.  You know what I'm saying?  Right, yeah.  It's not bad being white, right?  Yeah.  It's great.  How do you like...  Credit and all that.  I love it.  You like that.  The credit.  How do you like good customer service?  Oh, man.  I love it.  It's like...  It's like...  You know, because when you go to McDonald's with black people, it takes like an hour to  get a fucking... 
[03:22:00]  Like one fry.  What happens is...  Imagine this little scenario.  What about Starbucks?  What happens when you put your finger up on the sidewalk and you say, taxi?  Oh, you don't...  What happens?  How great is that?  They stop.  Yeah, but even on a Friday night, you get to get a cab.  Yeah.  It could be raining.  Because I'm white.  You get a taxi cab.  I said that the other day.  Because, you know, niggas don't get picked up, man.  No, I know.  I know.  I know who gets...  I know the struggle.  How is it to read on the train instead of listening to headphones?  That shit is impossible.  And how is it when you're listening to headphones on the train to be listening with an appropriate 
[03:22:30]  volume so everybody around you doesn't hear it?  How is that?  That's crazy, right, Who Kid?  How great is that?  How great is it?  That's some real nigga shit right there.  That's some real nigga shit.  You just got back, Who Kid, from this ridiculous...  Your voice is fucking infuriating.  You ate shit.  I didn't eat shit, dude.  I want you to sip water.  Take something.  You're a cracking little man voice.  I don't like it.  You just got pubes yesterday?  You should gargle, like, K-Y-Jill.  I've never done that.  Who Kid, what does that do to a person? 
[03:23:00]  Smooth it out.  Is that what you do?  That's what you do in Thailand.  That's what Who Kid did in Thailand with some Thai bitches.  Yo, there were some dicks out there.  I was running, dude.  What, the Thai girls?  They run and shoot them?  Like, oh, let me get them dicks.  No, I was running away.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  You saw the dicks?  Yeah, they had them out.  What do you mean they had them out?  In the streets.  They were walking with their dicks out.  Wait a minute, dude.  I don't think that happens.  First of all, in Thailand, if you spit on the street or spray paint, you get caned.  Yeah.  Why can you walk out with your...  I don't know.  How is it not a law that you can walk with your dick out? 
[03:23:30]  It's normal life.  Really?  I'm not sure about that.  I didn't even...  And I didn't see that on your Instagram.  I went to Phuket.  I think you're too white.  I think you're acting too white.  Yeah, you just accept anything is no...  Well, it's their culture.  It's their culture.  We accept it.  But what I don't understand...  You do.  That's your voice.  You have an old Yenta voice right now.  It's their culture.  It's their culture.  What can you do about it?  And they had some old dicks.  I was like, what's going on out here?  You have to understand, in 2013, you accept new things.  Yeah, the Cullens and those immigrants... 
[03:24:00]  We don't call them Cullens anymore.  What do you call them?  We used to call them Cullens.  Now they're just blacks.  I thought they were African Americans.  No, just blacks.  Oh, okay, Sal.  Is that a nigga on a horse?  Yeah.  Quote, unquote.  So you saw some nice...  Well, where were you?  You were in Thailand.  I'm in Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Hong Kong.  Jesus.  Australia.  Australia.  Australia must have been a bit of a relief.  Yeah, it was like...  That's the only place I didn't use condoms, but...  Australia.  And why is that? 
[03:24:30]  There's no AIDS there.  They don't have AIDS in Australia?  No.  Can I stop you for one second?  That's not true, first of all.  Do you know that for a fact?  Did my mic just come on?  No, I just turned up everybody's headphones.  Oh, thank you.  That's not true.  I do know that for a fact.  They do...  I just read this on the HuffPo.  HuffPo?  HuffPo.  They just found AIDS in Australia.  They did.  I swear to God.  Wow, who can...  That's got to be scary news for you.  That must have been like one case.  I know...  What do you think?  I know white culture is new to you, but do you read HuffPo? 
[03:25:00]  I don't know.  You're not that deep yet.  Okay, you're not that deep.  You don't have HuffPo?  HuffPo.  What's that?  HuffPo.  Well, you can follow HuffPo.  Add HuffPo.  HuffPo.  What the fuck is that?  It's HuffPo.  It's where we get our news from.  It's where we get our news, dude.  Entertainment.  For real?  Yeah.  Political HuffPo.  Yeah.  Comedy.  Tech HuffPo.  Yeah, everything.  Comedy HuffPo.  Everything.  I read the village voice.  Close to HuffPo.  No, it's very close.  But it's not HuffPo. 
[03:25:30]  See, Australia...  Speaking of HuffPo...  Where is Alan?  I checked all the bathrooms.  The bathrooms are locked.  I don't know where he is.  Where did you get your outfit?  Will and Grace?  It's like a fucking retired tennis player.  Retired tennis player.  It doesn't work when he has five ah-ahs thinking in it.  I gotta put your outfit on my Instagram, though.  Plus, Will and Grace is probably better than...  That's not even a bad thing.  It's just gay.  That's actually good.  And in 2013, there's nothing wrong with being gay anymore. 
[03:26:00]  I read on HuffPo, Will and Grace might be coming back.  HuffPo is very friendly to the gays.  Without the grace.  That's a little Dawson Creek to it, too.  I like that.  A little Vanderbeek to it.  A little Vanderbeek, yeah.  Like Spider-Man or something, right?  You look like Spider-Man today.  Yeah.  So where...  Before I got bit by Spider-Man.  Yeah.  Not after.  Yeah.  You look like Peter Parker.  Let me correct you.  Well, the A's thing is true because Hugh Jackman told me straight up there's no A's.  Yeah, but Hugh Jackman has the A's.  Yeah, I mean, that's...  I'm kidding.  No, he does not. 
[03:26:30]  If anybody in Australia has A's, though...  That's why.  That would be one of my favorites.  Wolverine has A's, but he keeps healing himself.  So he keeps getting coughing and getting skinny, but then he heals himself.  He's putting that adamantium dick in them dudes.  Adamantium?  Oh, that would hurt.  That was...  Oh, my God.  A little less subtle than some of us would have stated, but sure.  The adamantium...  What is it?  The adamantium...  Putting that adamantium dick in some dudes.  Every time he gets angry...  Yeah.  Just shoots out the guy's mouth.  G-men, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, I know.  The G would stand for gay men.  Right.  Okay.  That's very clever.  Who...  Oh, God.  Here he goes.  No, but go on with what we were talking about.  I don't know.  Thank you.  Just join us.  You can't shit out of here right now.  Yeah, they have AIDS.  There is AIDS in Australia.  Is there?  Yeah.  And I understand what you're saying is, like, you know, why I'm in Thailand and it's a little  more dangerous, maybe, to have sex with a drug.  They love dicks there.  Did you meet any ladyboys?  Yeah.  I didn't hang with them when they're like...  You didn't hang with ladyboys?  Look at me.  Look at me.  Stop. 
[03:27:30]  Look at me.  Look at me.  Ah.  There you go.  Stop it.  My pupils are fucked up, right?  Yeah.  There's a lot of dilation going on over there.  How was getting a head from a guy?  I never did that.  Listen to me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  I never did that.  Come on, Rob.  How was it getting a fucking handy by a fucking cute dude?  I wouldn't even do that.  Listen to me.  A little bit of a hairy pun.  When she docked her two-colored cock to your fucking one-colored cock...  Right.  I couldn't get hard for that. 
[03:28:00]  You couldn't.  You tried.  You couldn't do it.  I couldn't try, huh?  You couldn't get it done.  You didn't get hard, but she sure did.  What was your favorite spot?  What spot do you like?  You like Australia.  You like to hang in Australia.  Where?  Thailand is good because of the sex and all that stuff, but...  Is that back to the ladyboys?  No.  Okay.  The regular sex.  Right.  Yeah, you bust them open over there.  You're pretty big, right?  They're small, so you use them like sex slaves.  They're like sex dolls.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Ashton Cush would be a shame to you right now.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, just let's settle down with the sex slaves.  Let's just call them the hookers, boy hookers.  Australia is cool.  I mean, Australia, the pussy looks so good, yo.  Like, that's good-looking pussy.  Is it tan?  Like, the vaginas themselves.  They look good, like...  It's like a tan with, like, the hair is, like, you know...  Wispy?  From being in the sun, it's all light.  They shave it, so it looks like a newborn baby.  They squirt a little lemon juice in their pussy hair to make sure that it tans right.  I'm sorry.  Can we just stop with a newborn baby?  I'm about to have a newborn baby, and I don't want to have that visual.  That's true.  Well, we ain't got a daughter.  By the way...  I don't want to know if that's... 
[03:29:00]  That's why this weekend you should see Bob Kelly at the brokerage.  Yes.  Because it's the last gig that he's doing before he has a kid.  And we all know once he has a kid, he's going to get all pussy.  He's not going to be funny anymore.  Oh, thanks.  So you've got to see him this weekend.  That is so untrue.  I don't believe it.  I'm going to open up even more.  You think so?  Oh, my fucking emotions are going to be all over the place.  It's going to be new experiences.  And isn't comedy just emotion?  It's honesty.  Let me tell you, there's nothing more honest than a vagina with a head coming out of it. 
[03:29:30]  Are you looking forward to having that life experience?  I'm actually not going to see that.  I would hope not.  No, I'm not going to see that.  I watch one on YouTube.  I had to find one that was like in Guatemala, like with no electricity, with candles.  A crowning?  What the fuck?  Yeah, I didn't want to watch like in an operating room, you know, like I found a third world country birthing.  And this was to see if you can handle it.  Well, it's pretty fucking nasty.  But when it happens, it happens quick.  I mean, when that baby breaches and it comes and then. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, but I'm assuming that if you're looking at that.  Yeah, I'm not.  I'm not.  Every second.  Like that starts moving in slow motion.  I don't care how quick it's happening.  That's like one of those jackass 3D slow moving cameras where you see every wrinkle tearing.  I got two niggas, you know what I'm saying?  Two?  Really?  Two black kids niggas.  I mean, that's what they are.  Okay.  He's got two niggas and two white ones in Australia and two little Asian ones in Thailand.  Two little Vietnamese boys. 
[03:30:30]  He's got a couple Brazilian ones.  My kids are half Asian too, so it's like.  Are they really?  Oh yeah, your wife's Asian.  So when they came out, yeah!  They came out.  It was crazy.  They came out knowing karate?  So did you see the crowning?  I think first.  Did you see the crowning?  Were you even at the hospital when your wife gave birth?  I helped my wife hand.  You did?  You were a cop.  But you stayed above the waist.  Yeah, I couldn't see it.  It's smart.  Because when it happens, the shit splats out and hits the doctor in the chest.  I've heard that sometimes women, like, from their vagina hole to their asshole, the whole 
[03:31:00]  taint, they have to cut it open.  They do.  They make an asshole vajaj.  The whole thing is one big hole?  Well, no, no, no.  Hang on.  That's fucked.  Hang on.  That's not fucked.  First of all, some women tear.  Oh.  A little bit.  And then, if they need the room, they'll cut it, but then they sew it back up.  Mm-hmm.  He's right.  Yeah.  Snooki got four stitches, she told me.  Yeah, and then they make it tighter, so now the vagina's smaller than it all is.  So you get, like, a nice new vagina.  Yeah, it's like an upgrade. 
[03:31:30]  So it's like now, so once your wife has this kid, she heals up, you get used to having the  kid around, then it's like, oh, shit, I forgot.  Not only do I have this kid, I got a new vagina.  Yeah, it's like winning the price of right.  I mean, look at this TV and this skidoo, but I also want a car.  Right.  You can ride around in my car.  You're sitting there going, like, I've been riding around in my boat for weeks.  I totally forgot there's a Ferrari in the driveway.  Motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  Yeah, it's going to be disgusting.  You're going to have a pretty white baby.  I had a big black baby head come up. 
[03:32:00]  You didn't like that as much.  White babies have small heads.  Do they?  Look at Alan.  His head is small.  It looks bigger now because there's no eyebrows on it.  I have a pretty big cabasa.  That's Spanish for head.  Oh, shit.  Thank you.  Yes.  I was actually going to leave because I didn't know what that was.  Yeah, I knew.  I was like, my Siri doesn't work in here.  We got to keep Bobby in the room.  What is cabasa?  Would you like me to check the interweb?  No, I could have done that myself, Siri.  Thanks.  Sorry, Sam.  Why is your voice so deep? 
[03:32:30]  Who are you?  Your voice used to match my voice.  Are you going to take the uterus home after the baby's born?  I'm sorry.  Excuse me?  Didn't Tom Cruise eat the placenta?  Yes.  The placenta.  Not the uterus.  The woman actually gets to hold on to the uterus.  Where are you from?  Liberia?  Why would you take the uterus home?  Excuse me.  I'm a blizzard.  Yeah, the woman holds her uterus.  Yeah, I think she needs the uterus and her stomach.  Because you know what some women do?  Her vagina has to stay put.  Sorry, who kid? 
[03:33:00]  Some women continue to live lives after childbirth.  Yes, they do.  They continue to exist.  And there is AIDS in Australia.  Correct.  So, AIDS in Australia and women need dickheads.  I don't believe that, man.  Yeah.  You are a terrible representative of black people on this channel.  I looked at my dick when I came back.  It looks good.  Okay.  All right.  My mistake, then.  My mistake.  I'm an expert with my own dick now.  I would imagine.  You did the eye check on AIDS?  Yeah.  That always works.  Yeah, it looks healthy to me. 
[03:33:30]  I can't see it.  I can't see it.  Would you have a black light?  Like, you CSI'd your dick when you got home?  Yeah, this shit's ice, son.  It's all good.  If you actually put, like, a...  Yeah, man, I did a black light test on my dick.  I got one spot, and I got a black dick.  You know, if you put vinegar on your dick and then put a black light to it, if you see  white spots, that's a wart.  Says the guy with no eyebrows.  Says the guy with painted eyebrows.  That's right.  You're right.  He does have painted eyebrows.  Alan Think Jr., we should talk to you for a moment.  It's your last day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Your last day on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:34:00]  And you violate him on his last day.  You have no eyebrows.  I have no eyebrows.  I feel bad.  You do?  Well, here's the deal.  This show, Opie and Anthony's show, not this show, not the Bobby...  What is it called again?  This is called SBW.  SBW.  SBW.  SBW.  It's like 3LW.  Yeah.  We don't got AIDS.  Right.  We checked.  We looked.  Yo.  AIDS free radio.  Black like that shit.  See for yourself.  I don't like, by the way, that there's one black guy and we all have to turn black just 
[03:34:30]  because we can't see you.  Dude, we can't.  If he was gay, we'd all be going, what's up?  That's true.  Farrakhan said we all came from the black jeans.  That's right.  So y'all are all originally niggas.  So yeah, we're all...  Let's not get carried away.  I don't want my wife to leave me.  She's from Boston.  But why was it?  I wanted...  You ever what, kid?  Get the fuck out of here.  You about to give birth to a nigga, man.  You don't know it, man.  Could you go get the other female intern that we were talking to in the hallway?  I feel bad.  She's probably in her studio. 
[03:35:00]  I feel bad.  You know, you come in over there, you always want to believe in going, why did I do that?  Really?  Yeah, I just drew on a poor kid's face.  Alan, do you...  You got a long way to go with that hair shit.  Do you...  What hair shit?  I mean...  You talking about his eyebrows?  He doesn't get it back.  He ain't getting that back.  He doesn't have them.  You should keep...  I mean, now that I look at it, though, I'm glad I did it rather than anybody else because  they would have fucked those up.  It would have looked like shit.  Yeah, if I had done that, it would have been fucking weird.  It would have looked like two scratchy lightning bolts on his forehead.  That would have actually been nice. 
[03:35:30]  It would have at least looked a little extreme, you know?  Yeah, you could have been like a wrestling manager.  What do you think, Alan?  The lightning bolt kid.  What do you think?  What do I think about the eyebrows?  Yeah, specifically.  I mean, they're a little thick.  Yeah.  A little thick.  But it's character.  Your eyebrows before that were thick, so people are used to that.  What nationality are you?  I'm Bosnian.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what I was going for.  I was trying to give you your roots back.  Is he?  Yeah, I was trying to make you look like your great-great-grandmother.  Tell the Long Island media, Mirok, that she could come in here if she wants. 
[03:36:00]  That's nothing.  All right, I'll see if she comes in.  I just laughed at my own joke historically.  Mirok was talking in my ear, Bobby.  I'm sorry.  It's just the worst.  You're Bosnian?  Yeah, I'm Bosnian.  I like my own joke.  I'm great.  You're great-great-grandmother.  And I'm flying back in a week.  Really?  To keep those.  They'll let you in the country.  You'll be an ambassador.  They might lock them up for that shit.  We should actually connect them.  No, they're not the most accepting people.  Yeah, I don't think so.  You know that.  Have you been to Bosnia?  Hell fucking no. 
[03:36:30]  No, you won't.  You never got Bosnian AIDS?  You go to Vietnam and you went hell no to Bosnia?  I mean, not hell no, but I didn't know that people could go there.  I thought it was illegal for anybody to go there.  Not since 1994.  For real?  You can vacation in Bosnia?  Look, who gets now what we would call an educated man?  Yeah, but Vietnam is better than Bosnia.  Bosnia, yeah.  I mean, Vietnam was fucked up in the 60s and early 70s.  I know.  Bosnia has been fucked up for us.  I watch a lot. 
[03:37:00]  20 years.  I watch a lot of Wonder Years episodes, and Vietnam does not seem cool.  It's not cool.  I agree, but you know what?  The food is awesome.  You didn't have a nice pho?  No.  I never had a pho.  It's so good.  The pussies are thick there.  The pussies are thick?  Those are dicks, okay.  That's because that's a penis.  I'm sorry to tell you that.  Just because they roll it up and make it look like a hamburger pussy?  Yeah, that doesn't make it.  Doesn't mean it's a pussy.  Doesn't make it so.  When you tap it and it unflapples and then sticks straight up in the air? 
[03:37:30]  That means it's a dick.  What were the girls in the hallway saying about you, Alan?  I saw you talking to some of the female interns.  One of them is right here, Lauren.  We'll talk to her in a moment.  I want to know what her opinion is.  But what were they saying in the hallway?  They were trying to comfort me.  They were saying, no.  Physically?  No.  They wouldn't touch me with a fucking 10-foot pole.  They wouldn't?  No.  No way, no.  You've got to get some self-esteem with those new eyebrows.  No.  You think the new eyebrows should bring self-esteem?  I think you should get some self-esteem, dude.  I've had horrible self-esteem before these things, man.  Yeah, but listen, man.  Those new eyebrows, you should have some self-confidence. 
[03:38:00]  Go up to girls and ask them questions.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what those eyebrows are saying.  What are you doing tonight?  And then put the eyebrow up.  There you go.  You don't even have to put the eyebrow up.  It's already up for you.  Yeah.  He looks a little evil.  You would go, all you have to do is say, what are you doing tonight?  And then you swipe your hair back and just look towards them.  And the eyebrows aren't looking at him.  See?  It's perfect.  Watch.  Lauren.  Tilt your head.  You're an intern for Cousin Brucie, right?  All right.  So you got to see Alan.  Yes.  What do you think?  I told him that he should always have them sharpied in because he would look much scarier if he didn't 
[03:38:30]  have any because it looks like one big forehead and I think he looks better.  He should always have something pendled in, a new design every day.  Okay.  So, Alan, I want you to try out what we just set up for you.  Okay.  And see what Lauren's doing later tonight.  It's your last day as an intern.  Yeah, that's true.  So by tonight, you won't be an intern anymore.  You can date whoever you want.  Yeah, that's true.  And here's the thing, too.  I want you to have the confidence that goes with those eyebrows.  I want you to have.  So I want you to unclasp your hands, throw those shoulders back.  I want you to stand up. 
[03:39:00]  Stand up.  Wait.  Stand up.  Stand up and lean on an ass cheek.  Lean on an ass cheek.  Yeah, lean on an ass cheek.  That's what confident guys do.  That's what who kid did where the she-mails were.  Right.  That's how he didn't get AIDS.  Stand up.  Fuck up.  That's how you don't get it.  Now, look at her.  Look right at her.  Look at my eyes.  What the hell are you doing tonight?  Oh, no.  What the hell are you doing tonight?  Wait.  One moment, Nicole.  One moment.  What are you doing?  One moment, Nicole.  We're going to try something and then it's Nicole time. 
[03:39:30]  Ready?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Listen and look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Stop with that smirk shit.  You're confident.  Put those fingers away.  Confident guys don't use little fingers.  Yeah.  Use your hand.  Put it in your pocket.  Yeah, nigga.  All right?  Yeah.  Let's do it.  All right.  Yeah.  Now, look at her.  Look at her and go, what are you doing tonight?  What are you doing tonight?  Don't forget to swipe the hair and leave it.  No.  Swipe the hair and then say it.  Now.  I don't know.  What did you have in mind?  Well.  Well.  I'll take you.  Well?  How did you just say well? 
[03:40:00]  Oh.  I think I might have to.  I don't know how to fucking do this shit.  Look at her.  Look at her.  You know what, Bobby?  Look at her.  I want to trade out Lauren real quick.  No offense to you, Lauren.  No, no.  Don't take it.  I want to trade it out for Nicole.  Go, go, go.  I don't know if I can do this.  Nicole, come here.  And I'll tell you why.  I didn't know it was you.  And it's not because Lauren did a bad job.  It's because Alan told me.  She just threw up.  He has specifically jerked off to Nicole.  What?  Furthermore, Nicole has said that she would.  Why would you ever fucking admit that?  I don't know.  I think it's sweet.  You think it's sweet? 
[03:40:30]  I think it's very flattering to be jerked off to.  I am fucking in love with you.  What a sweet person she is.  I do it all.  I do it every day.  Yeah.  I mean, I think it's sweet, too.  I love you.  You know what, then?  You're sweet, too.  I am going to jerk off to you today.  Thank you.  See, I love this.  With no A's.  I'm actually going to jerk off to you, her, and Alan.  That's love.  And who kid's going to be sucking my dick?  No A's.  Yeah.  No A's.  That's the whole.  Nicole, I'm going to be thinking of you while Bob's giving me a handjob later. 
[03:41:00]  Well, you know what?  This is very sexual.  I don't have to handle all this.  Nicole also said when he was first interning, like one of his first times on the air, Nicole  said, yeah, I would do him.  No.  Yeah, I thought he was handsome.  Well, not right now.  I don't know what the fuck you did to your face, Alan.  I'm very disappointed.  Oh, boy.  What the fuck?  I'm going to fight with a razor.  This is bad.  That answers that question.  I'm telling you right now, if Alan, let me tell you something right now, keep the personality,  keep the looks right now.  If he knew how to play an instrument and write a song, and he fucking came in here and just 
[03:41:30]  wailed out some love song, these two chicks right here, including me, would fucking, they'd  bang this interesting weirdo.  But instead, he decided to shave his eyebrows because we gave him enough money to buy a video  game.  Alan, how much money did they give you?  I think it came out to, like, $95.  Alan, just round it off.  You know that your eyebrows are never going to grow back the same.  Alan?  I don't think so.  Alan, round it up to $100 when you tell the story in the future, okay?  And did Opie give you the extra money?  You know what?  I don't know.  Count your money.  How much money did you get for shaving your eyebrows? 
[03:42:00]  Shut up.  Opie and Anne were supposed to give me another $20 each.  I saw Anne do it, and I saw Bob Kelly put in $70.  I put in $10.  I put in $8.  I put in $10.  I had $8.  But that was for the extra money, not the original money.  How much money did you get, Alan?  $55, $105.  Oh!  Is that a little extra actual?  Something, something.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, shit.  Look, I blew a guy for a steak, so you made out that.  100%.  $116.  That's not bad, Alan.  That's not bad, dude.  But you think this is a fashion don't? 
[03:42:30]  Well, when I walked by the studio, you saw me look at you, because I couldn't figure  out who it was.  I just saw someone.  I was like, is this some, like, weird metal dude with weird, like, sharky eyebrows?  I was like, what happened?  And then I realized it was Alan.  It was Alan, little dude.  Would you today?  No, I would not fuck you anymore, Alan.  I'm sorry.  Well, not anymore.  What if he changed the expression on his eyebrows?  What if a softer look?  Maybe if it wasn't, yeah.  It's that the one eye is going up.  It's tweaking me out.  It looks so evil, right?  It's so evil.  And what about, you were saying that his eyebrows will not grow in the same? 
[03:43:00]  I don't think they grow in the same, because even, like, when girls get them, like, waxed,  and we get ours waxed, they don't, it doesn't grow back the same.  Yeah, you gotta be careful.  Once you fuck with hair.  Yeah, man.  Is that a concern of yours?  I don't see.  What do you feel?  Jason Shibiru just walked in.  Jason.  He's a bigwig with a lot of the executives here.  He's friends with that.  I'm big time.  No, he is.  He is one of the executives.  He is an executive.  Executive isn't my title.  Oh, boy.  You don't want to say that on this channel. 
[03:43:30]  He's cool with Bladder.  Oh, he is?  You don't want to say that on this channel.  Okay, sorry, my bad.  Yeah, no, management is a different team than this team.  No, it's cool.  I'm cool.  I'm fine.  He's cool with Bladder.  So, are you cool with Bladder?  Who cares?  Oh, that's smart.  Yeah.  He has that five o'clock shadow famous face.  Right, doesn't he?  Yeah, like that perfect five o'clock shadow that, like, only George Clooney and Brad Pitt can have.  George Clooney.  You got the George Clooney, too.  Those are two guys who I'm way uglier than.  Whereas, you're not an ugly guy, dude.  No, I'm all right. 
[03:44:00]  I'm fine.  You just compared him to Brad Pitt and George Clooney, Bob.  I was exaggerating.  Absolutely.  All right.  Maybe the guy from Friends.  David Schwimmer.  Schwimmer.  More my league.  More the Schwimmer.  Tell me this, Jason Chabiro.  Yeah.  You know management.  Yeah.  You're interviewing candidates for a possible job position.  You had a guy who, originally when he walked in, looking the way he looked, originally was a guy that Nicole said,  I would do that guy.  I would do him.  Why not?  This guy.  He's an awesome guy.  This guy walks in, though. 
[03:44:30]  Now, looking like this, does he get the gig?  Keep in mind, his eyebrows have been shaved off and Bob Kelly drew in a people's eyebrow with a Sharpie.  So, Bob, that was you who did that.  I got to say, great work.  Yeah, artistic talent right there.  Did you just say, guys, artistic, not artistic talent.  Can I just say that this is what I, this is my original sketch.  Okay, I like it.  You did pretty.  That's what I came up with.  It's pretty close.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I would say, as a man, also as a man who's no stranger to, like, my actual eyebrows kind  of look like that.  Yeah.  So, like, I'm no stranger to the thick brow.  Yes.  You don't want to, like, you're a fair-haired, fair-skinned man. 
[03:45:00]  You don't want dark black cartoon eyebrows.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I probably wouldn't argue.  Apparently he does.  What?  Apparently he does.  Because there are dark black.  I would say any job.  So, I, I, I would not, okay, that's bad.  That's not, what if there was an internship open?  Well, hold on.  Bob Kelly, you didn't, you didn't tattoo those things on.  They'll come off at some point.  Well, eventually.  Yeah, but when you wash them off, that won't come off.  That's the new Sharpie.  Yes.  It's called Forever.  No.  By Bob Kelly.  Yeah, it's what, yeah.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:45:30]  My, my fans actually asked for that because they didn't want it to, it kept rubbing off on  their tits.  Right.  So, I came up with Forever by Sharpie.  By Bob Kelly.  That's very cool.  I'm actually, I can't even look at him anymore.  I'm leaving.  You really, oh, wow.  Before you'd have sex with him.  Yeah.  And now you're leaving.  You went from him jerking off to me, he's cute.  Yeah.  I would have sex with him too.  Fuck, dude.  And now she got menopause.  Wow.  Yeah, she is dried up.  He threw me right into menopause.  That's fucked up, Alex.  He's like, yeah.  I don't know.  Twitching his eyebrow. 
[03:46:00]  You got the evil eye, right?  Menopause.  Oh.  I can never show my face in this building again.  Why?  You got internships over.  Well, that's true.  So, it's not too difficult.  Are you going to jerk off to that memory?  No.  I'm going to cry.  That would make more sense.  Do you have a girlfriend?  I'm sorry.  Wait, go ahead.  No, you go ahead.  I would have said it and make him go.  Can you do that for me?  Can you pretend to twitch the end of your eyebrow and go, you know?  The fake one, like right there?  Yeah, right there.  And then.  It was an evil shriek.  That's not as good, no. 
[03:46:30]  That was a bad idea.  First of all, that was fucking evil.  That was, that was like real evil.  That was serial killer real evil.  Like what we see, you know when you see the movie and then you see the actual footage?  Yeah.  That was the actual footage.  I'm glad.  Of a serial killer.  I'm glad that we did all this.  That fucking laugh is scary, man.  That was scary.  Your natural laugh is scary.  Yeah, your life.  Bobby, I'm glad that you brought up Jason Shibiru's Five O'Clock Shadow and the fact  that he walks around, it's permanent.  Apparently, he doesn't realize that when you have a razor, which, you know, it doesn't 
[03:47:00]  need to have a vibrating handle, a back scratcher, 10 blades.  Seriously, Shibiru, have you noticed the price that you pay for new razor blades?  What?  Have you noticed?  You know what?  It's been bugging me for a little bit.  It's how much?  Is there a solution?  How much is it?  How much is it?  You know, 20 bucks, 30 bucks.  Is that in pesos?  No.  You're doing this.  You're doing this.  Thank you for clarifying that.  You did say dollars.  You're doing this every month for the rest of your life, right?

That's a big get.  That's right.  That's a huge get.  Speaking of big gets, I wanted to tell you this, and Alan, I hate to draw the attention  away from you.  That's fine. 
[03:49:00]  Because only a fucking asshole who's attention all the time would let somebody shave off  their eyebrows and draw that bullshit on their face.  But, Alan, listen to me.  Look at me.  Stay with me, Alan.  Don't kill anybody today.  But, not looking like that.  Yeah.  Give it a mugshot.  Just get it.  Because you don't want that picture.  That's a mugshot.  Yeah, that's a mugshot.  That's one of those viral mugshots.  That's BuzzFeed, HuffPo, that's everywhere.  Yeah, HuffPo.  HuffPo.  Just keep it together.  We're HuffPo-ing?  Are you HuffPo-ing?  I only did this thing.  I didn't want to come off as a puss on the air.  Well, you didn't, Alan.  And you put some dollars in your pocket. 
[03:49:30]  J-Log is kind of an idiot, but not a puss.  Listen, here's the deal, Alan.  The last day that you were here, people are going to remember for two days.  Yeah.  And then they'll forget.  But listen.  But that's Monday.  It's like, at least I'll remember for the weekend.  I want you to, after this, go wash that shit off.  Listen to me.  Look at me.  I want you to walk up to me someday and go, dude, what the fuck was I thinking?  Yeah.  All right?  I want you to get your shit together.  I want you to get confidence.  I want you to go back to college.  I want you to learn an instrument.  I want you to get some pussy.  Learn an instrument. 
[03:50:00]  You understand me?  Yeah.  I want you to learn an instrument.  That's how you're going to get pussy.  Yeah.  That's how you're a creepy, weird personality.  If you know how to play guitar or drums, you're going to get some pussy with that weirdness  you've got going on.  Yeah.  All right?  Wash those eyebrows off.  Get some confidence.  Learn an instrument.  Now, this is what I wanted to tell you guys.  I know you're a wrestling fan, Bob Kelly.  Big fat.  Yeah.  I don't know if you did.  What?  Go ahead.  Did you see SmackDown on Friday?  Last Friday?  A week ago?  Did you like SmackDown better than Raw?  When?  It doesn't matter what you like! 
[03:50:30]  Leave that to Mr. People's eyebrow over here, Alan Thicke Jr.  I don't know if you saw SmackDown on Friday, but I was listening to it, and I heard a little  something.  Yeah, I heard about that, too.  You heard about it.  Let me play it for you.  While I was in Thailand.  While you were in Thailand, listen to this.  This is the play-by-play.  I played it yesterday, because I didn't know when I was going to see it again.  Who did it?  It's Fandango.  He's making his way to the ring.  Yeah.  And Josh Matthews is doing the commentary for him.  Love Josh.  Yeah.  We're in Detroit.  The Kid Rocks Fandango. 
[03:51:00]  Fandango.  And here's the film.  Fandango.  Now, the world-renowned DJs of Beachy and DJ Who Kid have been sampling Fandango's theme  in clubs from New York to Los Angeles.  Wow.  Wow.  Who knew?  Really?  You've been sampling Fandango's theme song.  For a long time.  Is that right?  Really?  For a minute, as they say.  Yeah, for a hot minute.  So you got the big mention on WWE SmackDown. 
[03:51:30]  Look at it.  By the way, this is how phony Who Kid is, and white people will never call him out on it.  Can I just translate something from white people that are listening?  A hot minute means a long time.  Yeah, like a really long time.  It's the opposite.  Who Kid is sitting there.  He's listening to this tape, and Josh Matthews goes, DJ, Who Kid is sampling it?  And his eyes light up like, wow, I just got mentioned on TV.  And I go, so you got mentioned on SmackDown.  And Who Kid just leans into the table and goes, yeah, I got mentioned on SmackDown. 
[03:52:00]  Like he knew the whole time.  Like this is no big deal.  Famous nigga, you know what I mean?  Yeah, you are, man.  You always got to be cool.  When are you going to stop trying to be cool so much?  He can't.  It's who, Kid?  What, he's 60% white here?  He repels Australian AIDS.  True.  Goes off his penis like there's Vaseline on his dick.  Don't try to pretend.  Like that was like a surprise.  Like, oh, this is very exciting.  I was with Gwyneth Paltrow yesterday, hanging out in the club.  What were you doing with Gwyneth Paltrow yesterday? 
[03:52:30]  They wanted me to be in a new movie coming out.  What new movie?  And I got the role, too.  With the Iron Man?  Iron Dick 3D.  What?  You think I'm joking?  You're writing jokes now.  Now you're going home and just writing.  Iron Dick 3D.  I'm in it.  3D is coming out.  Iron Dick 3D.  Strix only on DVD.  Gwyneth Paltrow is going to be in it.  She's going to be holding my dick.  They're putting a 3D movie on DVD.  Is she playing Pepper Potts?  Is that who she's playing?  Pepper Potts? 
[03:53:00]  I don't know, man.  But she's going to be holding these dicks.  These dicks.  These dicks.  There's going to be 10 iron dicks.  You have two dicks.  No, no.  It's going to be you and Don Cheadle, right?  The new Iron Man has like 30 Iron Mans on that shit.  Oh, okay.  What do you call your dick?  War Machine?  Herbert.  Herbert?  Did you call your dick Herbert, really?  You call your dick like an old Jewish accountant?  He likes having a white guy around him all the time.  Why?  Why is your dick Herbert?  I think Herbert is a hairy person.  So you have a hairy dick? 
[03:53:30]  Why don't you shave that shit?  Trim it a little bit.  I want to look like Alan here.  Dollar Shave Club.  Yeah, what about a little Dollar Shave Club?  Shave your dick a little bit.  It's cheap.  I'll let the owner shave my dick, but I ain't fucking waiting on Alan.  If I get the owner in here, E-Rock, you make sure you pull this clip.  If I get the owner in here, are you going to be here on Monday?  Yeah, I'll be here Monday.  You'll let the owner of Dollar Shave Club shave your dick?  Can I ask you a question?  He's nuts.  You better be banking on the fact that he's going to say no right now,  because I am going to proposition him to shave your dick.  Who's most likely to say no? 
[03:54:00]  Okay, can I ask a white guy question?  Go ahead.  You have hair on your head, you have an afro on your head,  and your pubes, is it the exact same?  It's like curly.  It's curlier down there?  It's like Sam's hair.  Is it curlier down in your pubes?  Yeah, you could ask me that question.  Or is it curlier up top?  No, it's curlier down there because of the humidity and the moisture.  There's moisture and humidity.  How?  Spiciness.  Yeah.  There's spice down there.  Like super spice.  It's like Indian food.  Yeah.  It's like curry.  Like a cootie pie. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, I can't believe it.  Harold.  Harold.  Hey, Kuma.  Fuck.  Yeah, but I would imagine your pubes are actually straighter than your actual hair.  It's true.  I have Asian man pubes.  Yeah, you do, right?  They're just black and straight.  Yeah, they're just dead.  Like a dead person's pubes.  Just like your hair down there.  Mine or yours?  No, my pubes is like your hair.  Yeah, you clarified that.  I don't need more pubic references to my hair.  You know, we went over that.  You're like a pubic.  He's got a pubic chin, too. 
[03:55:00]  Look at his fucking face.  What's pubic about my chin?  Well, yeah, it is kind of puby.  How so?  It looks like if you shaved your pubes, that's the skin where the pubes used to be.  Uh-oh.  This guy.  I don't know.  I would love for my bush fat to look like his chin.  You just keep the stubble down?  Well, there's just no dots of space.  It's just this beautiful, dark, it's almost cartoon, like when Superman takes a break and  goes on vacation and they draw in that beautiful five o'clock shadow. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  That's what he has.  I'd love to have that on my pubes.  Yeah, it looks like he's just painted on.  It's like G.I. Joe, five o'clock shadow.  He's got a full set.  Yeah.  That cluny face.  Action hero.  Yeah, my pubes look like Alan's chin.  Just blotchy spots.  My pubes look like Alan's eyebrows now.  They're just questioning everything.  Your eyebrows look like Alan's eyebrows now.  You definitely have Avenue Q eyebrows.  Alan used to have thick eyebrows. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, well, he does again.  Can I take him to the club tonight?  Because I've got a DJ tonight.  Can you come to the club?  Alan, will you go to the club with who?  I'll put bitches around you.  Everything.  Now, Alan, we've only got...  How much time do we have left, Eric?  Eric!  About...  I was counting.  You've got three and a half minutes.  Okay.  We've only got about three minutes left.  Is there anything...  This is the last time you're going to be on the air.  Today, I've got to commend you.  Yeah.  Because you went on the air, and you threw Sal under the bus.  And I thought it was beautiful.  I've never seen anything so precious.  Is there anything you'd like to... 
[03:56:30]  Is there any other secrets that have gone on behind the scenes on this show that you would  like people to be aware of before we leave you?  And I mean, this is stuff that it's like, you know what?  You came on here today and said, Sal said that Danny was the biggest asshole anybody  would ever meet.  So, you said that Sal said that, and Sal admitted that he did say that.  I did.  I did say that.  What else have people said?  What about people, or...  What do people say about people around here?  Wow.  I don't know. 
[03:57:00]  What?  What did he say?  What did your mouth just now?  We're on a radio show, you asshole.  What did your mouth just now, Sal?  They're walking and mouth something.  Spider-Man.  What?  What the fuck is that?  What did your mouth just now?  I think, I think Sal's trying to have me yell, Slabo!  Why?  Why are you trying to make me do that?  Mouth what?  You said something.  You mouth me, you mouth the words Slabo.  I said slow down.  Do you say Slabo?  Eric, you see what's going on in here, right?  I'm trying to stretch your time.  Sal is trying to get...  What are you stretching?  Sal is trying to get Alan to say Slabo. 
[03:57:30]  Why?  Why would, why are you trying to do that?  Because he wants, he wants to get under Eric's tits.  Look, yeah, you want me to get...  I didn't say Eric had tits.  That's a figure of speech, Sal.  Yeah.  But he didn't say he didn't want to get under him.  You look like the guy, the guy on the drapes.  You're turning back to me.  Because you came in here and tried to get poor, no eyebrows Alan to shit all over Fat Nagel.  I like Eric.  Why are you trying to get me to insult him by calling him Slabo?  You said it twice now.  Sorry, buddy, sorry.  I mean...  I'll shave your head.  What's his name?  Sal, right?  Sal.  Ouch.  Ouch. 
[03:58:00]  What?  Do you like, are you, do you like guys?  No.  I'm not asking to be an asshole.  You've asked me this off air many times.  Because I just wanted...  You said, oh, I got this friend of mine.  I'm like, I'm not gay.  Listen, are you sure?  I'm positive.  Are you fucking...  Alan, wait, wait, wait.  Are you absolutely sure?  We're going to run out of time because we've done this Sal gay thing before.  And Alan's just got the one day left.  So I want Alan...  Look at Sam just fucking steering the shit.  Give me the rundown.  How about Bobby give his plugs out before we... 
[03:58:30]  No, I'll let Bobby give his plugs out.  But I need Alan to tell me, number one, who the biggest asshole who works here now is.  Why would I not do that, Eric?  No, we're running out of time.  Bob knows what he's doing.  I will not let the show end.  I mean, the biggest asshole who works here now?  Yeah.  I mean, I guess the last person who really gave it to me was Troy, so I guess I have to nominate him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And how is Sal then?  Sal, you know, he started off rough, but now he's good with me.  Do you respect Eric as a leader?  Eric is a great leader.  What about Travis? 
[03:59:00]  Travis is awesome.  What do you think of Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly's really cool.  I like Bob.  DJ Hookin.  DJ Hookin's the man.  Opie or Anthony?  Pick one.  I can't.  Good for you.  What about Sam Roberts?  Number one broadcaster.  Alan Dick Jr., everybody.  Now, Bob, I don't want you plugging your shit.  No.  No.  It's going to be...  I'm just kidding.  Where am I going to be?  You're going to be at the brokerage.  Brokerage house tonight.  One show tonight.  That's it.  And it's almost sold out.  So get your tickets if you want to go.
