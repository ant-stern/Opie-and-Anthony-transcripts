<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a recap of their previous day's chaotic Philadelphia show.  Anthony, claiming a cold (though jokingly suggesting AIDS), recounted listener submissions for a “strangest item” contest: a dead monkey (in a bag, with fluids), a human ear, and a brain.  The contest culminated in a man performing a sexual act with the dead monkey, preceded by two women engaging in a highly sexual act on-air.  A post-show incident involving fellatio in the street angered the station manager, leading to a call from Tim Sabian, the show’s producer, to discuss the fallout.  The hosts also discussed attending a Kid Rock concert, noting the crowd’s reaction to his mention of ecstasy and the Confederate flag.  Studio guest Steve from foundrymusic.com promoted Dead Monkey Hummer photos from their website.  Jim Norton, who performed stand-up at the Kid Rock show (and whose performance was less than stellar), was discussed, alongside an uncomfortable rest stop encounter with a trucker during their drive back to Washington D.C., marked by Norton's bizarre behavior (biting his arm, nose-picking) and speeding.  Rich Voss's absence was noted.  A new contest, offering a trip to a Poison after-party, was announced.  A “Hi Mom” segment featured a prank call where the caller pretended to be a porn actress.


The show then shifted to Andrew Gore, a guest who brought a collection of disturbing items: a Jeffrey Dahmer playset, pickled punk pillows (featuring conjoined fetuses), a two-headed kitten, a pig with one head and two bodies, a mummified fetus, a mummified cyclops fetus (his “showstopper”), a Jonestown Massacre medallion, Richard Ramirez’s trial sunglasses, and a piece of the Sharon Tate murder scene floor. Gore, described as a collector of crime and freak show memorabilia, shared stories of acquiring these items, including contacting Charles Manson. The hosts discussed their recent stay at the Watergate Hotel, with Anthony recounting illness, valet mishaps, and a hand injury. Steve from foundrymusic.com provided updates from the parking lot, describing the large crowd and attractive women.  Stephen Lynch provided a brief musical interlude, dedicating a song to his mother.  The hosts’ commentary throughout was punctuated by vulgar language, sexual innuendo, and darkly humorous remarks.


The broadcast continued with more focus on the “Strangest Thing” contest, Andrew currently winning with the cyclops baby.  The hosts engaged in ribald commentary with the outside crowd, including porn actresses. They played a recording of a particularly impressive fake orgasm from a previous show. Steve from foundrymusic.com continued to report from outside, describing the crowd and their antics.  Rich Voss, performing later with Jim Norton, was sent outside to sell CDs, resulting in awkward interactions and a stand-up attempt on the studio steps.  A phone call from Jim Ross of WWE discussed the name change to WWE (due to a legal dispute), personnel changes, and a drunken incident on a charter flight.  Another “Hi, Mom” segment featured a caller pretending to be fired for masturbating.  The Greaseman made a surprise appearance, briefly reprising his persona before being asked to leave.  The show concluded with a woman promoting t-shirts and performing a “lollipop trick,” accompanied by commentary on her appearance.


A final segment included “the lollipop trick” (a woman retrieving a lollipop from Jim Norton's mouth), sexually suggestive banter, and a listener calling in with a shrunken head acquired during WWII.  The hosts and guests examined the shrunken head, engaging in increasingly vulgar conversation, including racial slurs and offensive stereotypes.  The show transitioned to an outside broadcast, with more offensive commentary and jokes directed at the crowd. Two women from adult websites were interviewed.  The broadcast ended with a contest winner announcement and plans for future segments, along with a commercial for arena football and a mention of an upcoming celebrity softball game.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, puff!  What do you think of, stupid?  Hmm?  You can act like a man!  Watch out!  Yeah, no!  You don't move?  Well, let me tell you something, my crowded big friend. 
[00:00:30]  Mama, I want to hear you.  Yeah, I want to hear you. 
[00:01:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  All righty.  Can you hear yourself?  No, Opie, I can't.  Hello, hello, hello.  I can't hear you either.  What?  I can't hear you in my headphones.  What?  We are broadcasting live from D.C., Anthony.  Yeah, but like now the music's all loud.  Well, we're trying to figure out all the buttons. 
[00:01:30]  Ben is already freaking out over here.  Maybe it's just the contact I took.  Maybe that's it.  It's making the sound all weird in my head.  Hey, I can hear you now.  Yeah, that's a little better.  All right.  It just sounds a lot different in the headphones.  When you do these traveling radio shows, you've got to get used to brand new studios every day.  Wandering menstruals.  That's what we are at this point?  Menstruals.  All right.  Well, we are in the studios of WJFK in the suburbs of D.C.  O&A on the road continue. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, barely.  Anthony is very, very sick today.  What happened?  I think I finally got the AIDS.  I think it kicked in.  I think you had AIDS splattered on you yesterday with that mess that was going on in Philly.  Like the monkey juice?  How long does it take to get the AIDS after a monkey spills its dead fluids all over you?  Concentrated monkey juice could cause the AIDS.  No, I had a cold.  I've had a cold for a little while now.  You were fighting a cold all week and a sore throat and it finally hit you last night. 
[00:02:30]  Last night just slammed into me, but I'm on some very good drugs.  I took some ecstasy and I think I'll feel better now.  That seemed to be the drug of choice at the Kid Rock show last night.  It got the biggest cheer.  Mr. Rock said ecstasy and the place went nuts.  It got the biggest cheer.  He mentioned the weed.  I think at one point Lit mentioned weed that opened up and doing some nitrous whippets out in the parking lot and that got a cheer.  But when Kid Rock mentioned the E, that got like, ooh, that was the big drug of choice. 
[00:03:00]  The place exploded.  So where do we start today?  We have so much to tell our fine, fine faithful listeners.  First of all, a trouble report.  Was there any trouble stemming from yesterday's program?  Yeah, I guess we could back up that far.  We left you guys at 7 o'clock from Philly at WISP.  We pretty much ended our show and had Tim Sabian and the gang clean up after us.  We're good at that, aren't we?  We just flee town. 
[00:03:30]  I like how we could just pick up.  We left immediately following the show.  We create horrific situations and messes and we can't be bothered.  We've got to get to the next city.  We've got another town to move on to.  Yeah, I mean, Philly's a distant memory at this point.  Exactly.  They're way in our rearview mirror.  We're like that Bob Seger song.  Yeah, now it's all about D.C.  Back on the road.  I was driving down here this morning and Tim gets a hold of me in my car.  He goes, dude, dude, I got to go upstairs and deal with the GM of the building. 
[00:04:00]  Uh-oh.  Of the building?  Yeah, I'm like, what's the problem?  They're not into the dead monkey Hummer thing?  He goes, actually, it was the other thing.  That didn't get us in trouble?  The dead monkey Hummer?  Uh, not yet.  Not yet?  Okay.  I'll wait for that shoe to drop.  That takes about six months, Anthony.  You should know that by now.  Yeah, all right.  I'll look forward to that.  So, uh, he tells me that, um, the building wants to talk to him because of the lady with the kid that was giving a Hummer outside WYSP yesterday. 
[00:04:30]  Now, how is our own Tim Sabian responsible, uh, for that?  I guess when Super GM Ken Stevens is not in town, Tim's in charge.  Super cranky Ken Stevens?  Super cranky GM Ken Stevens?  He was a little cranky yesterday with us.  You met him?  No, on the phone.  Oh, yeah, I know.  He was, like, cranky, wasn't he?  I'm starting to think he doesn't like us anymore.  That's the vibe I'm getting.  He runs, uh, the station we're on in New York, Philly, and here in D.C. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And he's avoiding us.  Totally.  Did we see him yesterday?  He was in Philly yesterday.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  He was in New York yesterday.  Got down just as we were getting off the air.  Because remember, we had Sabian going, I gotta go pick up the boss.  Yeah.  Now, we come down to D.C.  Where is he today?  Philly.  He's one day behind our little road trip.  He's avoiding us.  I thought they were supposed to show up at Kid Rock last night.  Uh, that's what I thought.  Looking so, uh, like they should be there.  Right.  Tim Sabian and Ken Stevens in their suits. 
[00:05:30]  That would have looked great.  Watching Kid Rock in their suits.  So, uh, he, uh, he tells me that they're really, really pissed off at, uh, the gang up  there in, uh, Philly.  Oh, boy.  Uh, you know what, though?  We couldn't, we didn't know that, uh, mother was gonna do that.  Who could tell?  If you didn't hear the show yesterday, we had about, uh, I don't know, at least three  or four hundred people outside the studio when it was really crazy.  Yeah.  A lot of people were coming and going, uh, during the whole show, but if a woman wants  to, you know, hob a crank or two out in the crowd, what will we do, uh, stop her? 
[00:06:00]  Well, how it went down, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, she was there with a kid.  I got that one.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Uh, she was there with a kid in a stroller.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden she sees an old neighbor that is there to see us.  Okay.  Howdy, neighbor.  And most people will give a kiss on a, on the side cheek or maybe a handshake.  Little hug.  She goes, oh my God, it's been so long.  Next thing you know, she drops to her knees. 
[00:06:30]  Zip.  Wow.  In front of the, I don't know, a couple hundred people at that point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh my.  Uh, but before she does that, she says to somebody else here, hold my kid.  Hold my kid.  And the kid was being passed around like a, like a mosher at a grunge show.  Yes.  Oh, she passes the kid off.  She gets down.  Ice stars.  She gets, uh, she gets down on her knees.  Yeah.  Does the thing and then gets her kid back and leaves.  And for some reason, Tim's in trouble for that.  Hey, hey, you turned off your mic there.  No, I didn't. 
[00:07:00]  Yes, you did.  Oh, there's a button over there.  Okay.  I was adjusting my headphone volume.  I may have pressed a button.  So how is Tim responsible for that?  If a girl wants to greet, uh, a guy like that?  I don't know.  I, we should get Tim on the phone if we can real fast.  Maybe Rick or Ben could work on that, but, uh, I don't, you know, it's not his fault.  No.  We didn't go on the air and say, Hey, we need someone to do this for us today.  No.  We will next time because it's a great thing.  It's a great bit.  But, uh, no, we didn't.  No.  We were firmly behind the, uh, guy doing that to the monkey. 
[00:07:30]  The dead monkey homer.  He turned out to be Mr. Annoying backstage, I hear, uh, with Kid Rock.  Yeah, Kid Rock almost punched a dead monkey homer guy in the face.  Yeah, he, he won, uh, the opportunity to go backstage and meet Kid Rock, have a couple  of things signed by Kid Rock, and, uh, shake Kid Rock's hand.  And I hear he was standing on line with a bunch of other winners of various contests.  And he's just screaming that he wants beer, and he was making demands. 
[00:08:00]  Like, he's backstage, and he had an image of what backstage is supposed to be, and he  wasn't getting it.  No one was paying attention to him.  Right, he's screaming, you know, where's the beer?  I want the beer.  And then he's trying to explain to Kid Rock how he won.  And Kid Rock could care less.  Could care less.  And he's just getting it all wrong.  Like, he wasn't being detailed enough.  Right.  Yeah, you know what I did?  I put it in a monkey.  What?  Kid Rock says, wow, okay, move on.  What does that mean?  I got another guy here I got to sign something for.  Yeah.  Annoying monkey guy. 
[00:08:30]  Well, it went down yesterday, and it's going to be, uh, it's going to be talked about for  many years to come.  Yeah.  It will become legendary.  And I, I have to tell New York, uh, Philly beat you yesterday.  Yeah, that, I don't see how that will ever be topped.  Philly, I should say Philly beat us.  Yeah.  Because we are, uh, from New York.  When you, uh, when you have a guy, uh, doing that to a monkey, a dead monkey.  We were looking for the strangest thing, basically.  A guy comes in with a dead monkey in a bag. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  With all the, uh, dead monkey fluids at the bottom of the bag.  Who knew a dead monkey makes so much juice?  Ah.  Because he looked completely frozen, it looked like.  But he was just dead, and I guess rigor mortis, I don't know what it is.  But he's in the bag, and he's making the face like a Han Solo frozen in the carbon mite.  Remember that?  Mm-hmm.  The look he made?  Uh, he looked just like that.  But at the bottom of the bag was this reddish, bloody, pussy, green ooze. 
[00:09:30]  Liquid aids, basically.  Oh, yeah.  Forget about it.  Imagine them putting a whole syringe full of that and going around sticking people.  Sticking people in various locations as to make a happy face on a map.  Right?  Screw the pipe bombs.  So he brings it in, and, uh, and then, uh, the guy who brought in the gook ear.  Yeah.  Started realizing, oh, my God, I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose the front row tickets to Kid Rock.  I gotta come up, come up with something else.  Because the guy that brought the brain was then talking that he was gonna eat a piece of the brain. 
[00:10:00]  So now, gook ear guy goes, I'm gonna eat the gook ear.  They're like, you can't eat the gook ear.  It's like a rock now.  It's petrified.  And it's not really over the top.  Dead monkey guy, just from bringing in the dead monkey, wasn't gonna win either.  I'm so bummed we didn't get to see a guy eat a piece of human brain.  Yeah, I would have been.  But we were running out of show, so we had to go right to the, what we like to call the showstopper.  So dead monkey guy sacrificed his dead monkey to be used by gook ear guy.  And when those two came together, pfft, magic. 
[00:10:30]  Which two?  Oh, the two contestants.  Yeah, because dead monkey guy wasn't gonna win.  No.  And gook ear guy wasn't gonna win.  No.  Like, you know, it was gonna be brain guy eating the brain.  Sort of a chocolate in my peanut butter thing, you know?  You got your mule in my monkey.  Hey!  You got your monkey on my mule.  It's two great treats in one.  And I'll confess.  You stink.  So then, uh...  Then we had Taylor there doing a little lesbian thing.  Little.  Could be the hottest girl-on-girl action ever, ever witnessed by our program. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, we're gonna have to bring Taylor to New York City.  They went at it.  She passed the audition.  We gotta get her up to New York City.  It was so refreshing not to have to beg and plead to get two beautiful girls to just go  at it like they did.  They went right down to the floor.  They took it to floor level, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  And just went at it right to hardcore action.  Oh, yeah.  She was...  She actually seized another girl's hair and went,  Tussle!  Right!  Kinda, woo! 
[00:11:30]  And, uh, this was to try to get the guy prepared for the monkey stunt.  Because you can't just look at that monkey face and go,  Ooh!  Yeah, that is hot.  I need that.  That's where I wanna put it.  Yeah.  You know, so it was kinda like the girl's show was kinda fluffing for him.  And it was totally, uh, ineffective.  Didn't work.  Hottest two girls going at it.  Didn't work with the guy thinking of what he had to do with this dead monkey.  So, uh, we just figured, well, regardless of the state of your mule, 
[00:12:00]  you have to now do the act.  Well, he was, he was packing a little bit, though.  So, yeah.  Uh, yeah.  So, uh, the monkey bag, the monkey in the bag was brought out of another bag.  And then that bag was cut open right at the head.  The monkey head was poked through the dead monkey head.  And the guy, uh, did it with his mule.  Did his thing.  The best part is when he did it, wasn't quite good enough,  he grabbed the back of the monkey's head and pushed. 
[00:12:30]  It was one of the sickest things we've ever seen.  Absolutely.  In a, in a radio, uh, studio.  Just thinking about it beforehand and talking about it,  having laughing so hard, I, I was like,  there's no way this is gonna really happen.  But it, it happened and, uh, that beats everything.  I cannot see how anybody could do something that's gonna make us look and go,  wow, that's sicker than a guy getting treats from a dead monkey.  Well, we're gonna try today in D.C.  Yes, we're gonna try.  We got a bunch of people, uh, in the parking lot of, uh, WJFK as we speak. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, wait, Tim Sabian's calling in.  Oh, good.  We should put him right on the phone here.  Let's get to the bottom of this.  See what kind of trouble, uh, Tim Sabian.  How do we work phones here in D.C.?  Uh, just tell Earl to get Tim Sabian on the line?  All right, there we go.  Who do you want on this phone?  Hey, Tim, what's going on?  I just spent the entire day apologizing to everybody.  I know.  I'm a doodle.  We kind of explained that.  You called me, uh, in the car as I was road tripping, uh, from Philly to D.C.  And, uh, and, uh, you were, you were telling me, man, I gotta go upstairs.  I'm not looking forward to this.  This sucks. 
[00:13:30]  Damn it.  Who were you in trouble with, Tim?  Well, it's just that the, uh, things got a little out of hand, you know, with, uh, the monkey and, uh...  Oh, he's a monkey got you in trouble?  No, that, that and so much that, but there was a lady in the, uh, up front in the building,  I guess, that was, uh, you know, should we say, a little overzealous?  Yeah, but we had no clue that that was going on until after the fact.  I know.  Is that the excuse you used?  That's what I said.  I said, I didn't know.  We're pissed that we didn't know.  We would have exploited that on the radio for an hour. 
[00:14:00]  We'd have brought her up and had her fluff the monkey guy.  Right.  Why not?  Help him out.  Help a guy out.  Yeah.  So how's the cleanup in Philly?  It, uh, it cleaned up well and people are buzzing about it.  It was great to have you guys here.  Sorry to leave you, uh, with the mess to clean up, but we, you know, we have another radio show to do, dude.  I just, I just want to know when you can come back.  We're like the Navy SEALs.  We got to go in, we mess things up and leave, and then we leave other people for the cleanup operation.  Yeah, they send the cleanup crew in.  Cleanup operation.  It's all part of the, the, uh, part of the duty, you know, part of the deal. 
[00:14:30]  Exactly.  Uh, Tim, you know we'll be back soon.  We love Philly.  Oh, yeah, I tell you, man, people down here love you.  Cool.  What a great time we had.  And then, uh, Kid Rock.  Yeah, Tim, thanks for, uh, thanks for stiffing us at the Kid Rock show.  Uh, you didn't want to see me after 10 o'clock.  That really, uh, shows, uh, us that we really should, uh, do a lot of things with Philly.  When the guy in charge decides to go home at 7.02, and we're out partying.  Yeah, that was true.  I didn't get home till 10.30 last night.  And we're out partying until the middle of the night.  But thanks, though.  Thanks for the hospitality up until 7. 
[00:15:00]  That was nice.  Were you out with cranky Ken Stevens?  No, I was, we had our quiet time together.  What happened?  We have our quiet time.  We get to meet and talk about the station and so forth and go over stuff and, you know.  All right.  It's not all fun and games.  Tim, you have nothing.  Okay.  But thanks for, uh, showing us good time.  I hope you guys are the best.  Oh, Jim wants to thank you.  Hey, Tim.  Oh.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Wow.  You got to give it to him. 
[00:15:30]  Hey, Tim.  Yeah, you got to give it to him.  Tim, you're still there.  We know.  Well, thank you, Tim, for, uh, the good time.  All right.  I didn't tell you something.  That was good.  Oh, wow.  Now you're going to dry us?  No.  No.  No, no.  Tim Sabian, everyone.  Hey, uh, Gomez from DC writes, would Sabian and Stevens have been as out of place at the  Kid Rock show as Rich Voss in a comedy club?  Oh, speaking of the devil.  Uh, we got to get Voss in here.  So where are we at?  So that, that was pretty much it with the Dead Monkey Hummer thing.  It was a great day.  Steve from foundrymusic.com is in studio. 
[00:16:00]  He, he made the trip with us.  He's a couple radio shows behind.  He is, uh, not.  Oh, you're getting close now.  Dead Monkey Hummer, uh, picks, uh, and the, what was that other thing?  The Money Snatch picks are up right now on the website.  Rock.  Dead Monkey Hummer picks, uh, picks are up on foundrymusic.com.  I didn't say anything because I wanted to make sure I got them up before you plugged  it.  Whoa.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  That link is off opiananthony.com as well.  Check it out.  Dead Monkey, Hummer picks.  We ever need a guy to get a rod again to put it in a monkey's mouth? 
[00:16:30]  We should have Ed Danson how he used to do it.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, my God.  You're a horror.  You're a horror.  You're a horror.  Thank you, Jim.  We're here for Jim Norton because he's got two sold-out shows down here.  And, uh, I guess the gang ran into Voss at the train station.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  Uh, where is Voss?  We all, again, have our various travel stories, mine of which is a horror show. 
[00:17:00]  You know what?  Why don't we take a break and we'll get into that?  Because, Dan, you need some time.  Well, yeah.  I got, well, we could talk about a little bit about Kid Rock and stuff, I think.  Yeah.  That really, that kicked ass.  The show was unbelievable.  I know he's playing the Garden tonight.  You guys are going to have a great effing time, man.  That is a show, man.  The new CD, Cocky, it's great.  And it came across great in concert.  It was really, really good live, man.  Let me tell you something.  Jim Norton is not, I mean, because I was playing some of the Cocky CD from New York to Philly  for Jim.  Get him ready for, you know, Kid Rock and stuff.  And you were enjoying some of the stuff, but you weren't really into the rap metal thing, 
[00:17:30]  right?  Yeah.  Is that fair to say?  Yeah, because I like him, but I'm never going to be huge.  But last night, he kept coming up to me when we were in that booth going, dude, he's unbelievable.  This is great.  Yeah, he really, really was great live.  I was very impressed.  And I should say, Kid Rock and D.C. tomorrow night.  So, you guys here in D.C. are going to love him.  Kick-ass.  It's one of those great, just old-time rock shows where there's pyro, huge stage, there's  a show going on, chicks dancing on the side of the stage.  A great light show, and him, just full of energy.  The band sounds great. 
[00:18:00]  It was just an all-around fantastic show.  Almost two hours, and he was sick, and he still did almost two hours.  Yeah, the guy went on for a long time.  How about that Confederate flag, huh?  Nice.  You know something?  Wow.  He's got balls, man.  The guy loves, the stage show looks great.  He's got a huge trailer with, I guess, Coors Light neon signs, because they sponsor the  show, and laundry lines.  Huh?  I never knew that was a... 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, it was a big, one of those big silver trailers.  One of those old-fashioned trailers.  Oh, dude, I didn't even notice that.  Old-fashioned silver trailers.  You see a lot of those down south.  Yeah.  They live in those damn things.  I know.  I honestly got...  I mean, the old-fashioned kind, like he had on the stage.  The silver ones.  They look like the old Silver Street type...  It was on the stage, and I didn't notice that.  Yeah, it was right on the back of the stage.  And then, going from that to these big spools that the keyboard player and DJ were sitting  on, were laundry lines full of, like, laundry.  There's a wash up there.  It looked like a great white trash type pink flamingos stuck on the stage. 
[00:19:00]  Just white trash.  Yeah.  It looked like a white trash trailer.  And then, during one of the songs, I can't remember which one, another huge explosion  has happened, and the Confederate flag, the biggest Confederate flag...  I've ever seen.  I've ever seen.  It took up the entire backdrop of the stage.  Had to be, what, eight stories high, this thing?  And the place went nuts.  Woo! 
[00:19:30]  And I'm just like, oh, my goodness gracious.  Because I saw, you know, a couple of black guys sitting right down in front of us.  I'm just looking like, oh, Jiminy Cricket.  That's got to be just like, hey, put on your kid rock hoods.  Come on.  Come on, people.  Now, I know he doesn't mean it in that context.  I would love to get him back on the show to see where he was going with that.  And I don't mind the fact that the South is proud of what they fought for.  Whatever you're fighting for, whether it's right, wrong, or indifferent, if you're willing 
[00:20:00]  to give your lives to fight for it, that's fine.  And the flag represents that.  But to just unfurl it like that with the big fireworks, and it comes out of nowhere,  I just kind of went, ooh, hee, ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  Going right through me.  Yeah, I know.  It's kind of like, wow, there's got to be some people that went, oh, man, and I was digging  on the brother.  You know?  It's like, but then after that, later on, the big American flag that's unfurled, it's  just as big as the Confederate one was, and the place just goes crazy.  Overall, it was a great show.  Great show, man. 
[00:20:30]  And, you know, I've got to give props to Philly.  They know what this wow thing is all about, big time.  Dude, how cool is that?  And they know how to do it the right way.  The whole spectrum, I mean, there was girls wowing all over the place, guys walking around  with wow signs, and everyone was respectable to the chicks that were doing it.  In between the lit.  No one was harassed.  It was unbelievable.  In between Lit, who opened, and Kid Rock, when they're changing over equipment, the lights  come up, they're playing music, a bunch of guys had wow signs.  And they're just walking around the floor, pointing their wow signs up to the seats. 
[00:21:00]  And the upper tier, like the balcony area that goes around the whole arena, there were  girls up there where the spotlight guys started putting their spotlights up on the chicks.  And they're flashing.  Then all of a sudden, two girls.  They go up there.  There's no one else in that section.  Yep.  I mean, it's so obvious that, you know, they're going to do something.  The spotlights hit them.  Everyone chanting, whip them out, whip them out.  These girls grab each other.  They start just making out.  Yeah, they pretty much go, screw the whip out thing. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, they start making out.  And they just go nuts.  And then they're grabbing each other, and then they whip them out.  And the place goes mad.  It was really, really cool.  And the reception we got when we hit the stage was amazing.  Yeah, thank you, Philly, for that.  But we hit the stage, man, and the whole crowd went crazy.  And Jim had a line, and it killed.  It killed in front of 10,000, 12,000 people.  Oh, but you are an ass, man.  It killed, right, Jim?  You are an ass.  I told Jimmy.  Now, Jimmy's used to doing his little comedy shows. 
[00:22:00]  But just in case you've never seen a tumbleweed blow through an arena.  It was like a ghost town.  Nice.  Here's my rules of hitting a stage in a major city at a huge rock show.  You can't lose.  Here are the rules, Jimmy, next time.  You mentioned the band that they came to see.  Oh, yeah.  They love it.  You mentioned the city you're in.  Oh, yeah.  How we, when I yell into the mic, how we doing, philly effing Delphia, the place comes apart. 
[00:22:30]  Right.  Then you say mother effer a lot.  Because every time you say mother effer, the place goes wild.  Because here you are saying mother effer.  City, band they came to see, mother effer, can't lose.  I hand the mic to Opie.  My job is done.  Opie, following similar rules and giving out the T-shirts.  It's, you know, then I went with the other thing, the obvious.  What was the showstopper?  Whip him out Wednesday?  Dead Monkey Hummer. 
[00:23:00]  Dead Monkey Hummer guy.  So I got the guy.  He's right in the front row.  Come on up here.  I'll introduce you.  He brings Dead Monkey Hummer guy up.  The place goes nuts, but they all listened to our show that day.  They listened to the show.  I killed.  My 30 seconds on stage, I killed.  You give the mic over to Jimmy Norton.  Right.  And this is, you know, I do my thing.  And then there's like 30 seconds of the girls throwing out T-shirts and stuff.  And at that point, Jim decides that he needs to try out new material.  So Jimmy hits the stage.  And Jimmy, could you reenact that moment for us right now?  The guy with the monkey guy standing right there and Opie's there. 
[00:23:30]  And this is what I say.  You know, it's key, though.  What?  You let way too much time pass by between what I did and the line that would have probably killed if you had better timing.  Yeah, I just stink.  And I talk about the monkey guy, and I say, and I'll confess, it was just me in a monkey mask.  What? 
[00:24:00]  What?  Oh, it was awful.  So then I said, okay, terrific.  I threw out another mother effort, got him cheering again, and we got the F-1.  So there's some wind for you.  All right, we got to move on.  Little thin, quivering lips.  You forgot the Opie paws.  I wasn't.  I'll confess, it was me in a monkey suit.  It's odd, at a kid rock show in Philly, that if any joke with I'll confess starting, it didn't work.  I'll confess.  I'll confess, semicolon. 
[00:24:30]  I'm doing comedy almost 13 years, and I tried that awful line.  I am terrible.  So Opie is one of the biggest scumbags.  The second, so now we've lost off stage.  It was a very good line, but the timing and the people didn't care.  No one cared at that point.  It just didn't matter.  When we walk off stage, now I'm feeling good.  I go to Opie, I go, wow, that was a great response we got from Philly, man.  And we're feeling good.  Opie doesn't miss a beat.  We get to the last step from the stage to the hallway, and Opie turns around and just goes, 
[00:25:00]  your line sucked, Jim.  Like, just couldn't wait to dig the screw.  Just turn the screw in on you, man.  That's what friends do, though.  My voice was still echoing by the time.  Right, exactly.  I'll confess, confess, and that you stink.  Dude, not only...  Monkey suit.  Suit.  Not only...  Monkey mask.  Mask.  The two M's would get the gang going.  Suit might have done it.  Maybe it would have.  And I couldn't wait to tell him right after the fact. 
[00:25:30]  And then it was pretty much the first thing I said to him this morning when he woke up.  Oh, you did.  When I called his room.  You bastard.  I couldn't deny it.  I was like, you know what?  You're right.  That was awful.  I'm like, I finally got something on this guy.  The nerve of me.  He's been killing on our show, killing in concert, and we finally got something we could kill him on.  The thing that killed me was you couldn't wait.  Without a doubt.  It was the earliest possible time that you could have just railed.  And I knew he was feeling a little weird about it.  Oh, yeah.  Feeling a little like, oh, well.  The guy's used to getting laughs and applause and getting the crowd crazy, and he says it. 
[00:26:00]  And I'm like...  So instead, because most radio guys are insecure and stuff,  you'd help someone through a bad moment like that.  No, not you.  Oh, dude, it wasn't that bad.  The mic might have been a little weird.  Maybe they would...  I think there was a girl flashing.  I didn't say anything.  I know.  You come up with excuses, maybe.  But no way.  I'm like, screw that.  I wasn't saying anything.  The first thing I said was, hey, man, that went really well, man.  What a great response from Billy.  Everybody in the whole scene.  Anthony was nice.  He was trying to pull me in to everybody's good response.  Pull you in to everyone else's success up there. 
[00:26:30]  And Opie, I didn't get the last word how well it went out of my mouth.  Opie, Norton, you stunk.  You're lying, you stunk.  I think it was something sarcastic, too.  Like, your line went over well, Jimmy.  Boy, that went well.  But I didn't want any excuses.  We even got back to a little booth they had, and Sandy tried to go,  I don't know if the mic might have been on.  I'm like, no.  You stunk.  Oh, the mic might have been on.  They all heard it.  People at the Tower Theater heard it, and it got a zero.  They all had this delusion in their head where they couldn't understand English. 
[00:27:00]  In English, all at the same time.  Maybe they were all pondering the depth of it.  Jim, I'm sure when the people come to see you tonight here in D.C.,  they're not going to ask you to, you know, redo that monkey line.  They don't understand.  I'll open with it.  It stunk, and I'll take it like a man.  It was awful.  Maybe they thought you said chunky mask,  and we're trying to figure out why would someone wear a chunky mask.  Maybe they were all elbowing each other.  Hey, he's confessing.  Oh, wait.  What did he say?  Oh, you missed it.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen.  Listen.  We've got to get moving here.  Back it with no time.  We have our first controversy here down in D.C. 
[00:27:30]  Rich Voss is missing.  Now, you know Rich Voss.  He loves mic time.  Is he getting another tat Jew somewhere?  Well, find a pen and a notebook,  and you know he won't be anywhere near that.  But he's missing,  which means I think he's getting a Hummer somewhere.  There's only one thing he would blow off airtime.  Yeah.  And that is to have some action in the back of a car somewhere.  Can I buy you a house?  Should have seen him at that car.  I know. 
[00:28:00]  He's a mess.  All right.  Let's tell the folks what's going on today, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're doing exactly what we did in Boston, New York, and Philly yesterday.  Putting it to you, D.C.  Come on.  Yeah.  We're looking for the strangest thing that you guys bring down to the studio here in D.C.  WJFK.  There's a little party starting to form outside in the parking lot.  You can join us.  We love when people show up.  And today.  Here it is.  Today, the winner of the strangest thing.  Yeah.  He's going to win a two-night, three-day trip for two to Hollywood to attend an exclusive  end-of-tour party with Poison at the Roxy Theater. 
[00:28:30]  Poison will play a very intimate set followed by an evening of schmoozing with the winners.  Trip is courtesy of VH1 Classic, the new 24-hour music network.  We're going to send Steve out there in a few minutes to see if anybody has brought anything  yet.  Okay?  All right.  We're going to go find Rich Voss, and we've got to talk about Anthony's experience at  the Watergate Hotel, and lots of stuff going on in the news.  We've got a really busy show, so thanks for checking us out today.  We'll be back.  The Anthony Show.  You're all burning it out, damn you. 
[00:29:00]  What about the bucket of eggs in the face?  You guys are a mess.  All right.  Who wants a bag of wagged-out fat broad?  You're such a disease.  Shut up.  I'll cave your head in with a friggin' spade shuffle.  The show's going bad fast.  Nothing says hot like a P-Z-O-T-A-M.  That was O-N-A quality.  No, opium anthony.  I'm a quiet taste.  1027-WNA-WO.  No, opium anthony.  23 skidoo.  Are you scared?  They're going to cowboy.  I'm a singer in black.  So throw my finger in the air. 
[00:29:30]  Let me see where your rats stay.  Hey, hey.  Let me hear where your rats stay.  Hey, hey.  I'm giving it back, so say.  Hey, hey.  Show me some madness, say.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show, broadcasted live from WJFK in the suburbs of  D.C., officially, Anthony.  Well, yeah, it's fun.  We put us up in the Watergate Hotel. 
[00:30:00]  They're right there in the Watergate.  Which was kind of a treat.  Nice.  A very historical hotel.  And you know something?  The people that work there now, it's a Swiss hotel, you know, Opie.  Yeah.  And the people that work there now have no clue.  They have no clue about what happened in the history of the Watergate Hotel.  Because, as we learned last night, because I was driving from Philly to Washington with  our own Jimmy Norton.  Little Jimmy Norton was with me.  So, we had a little bit of a problem.  It was your turn. 
[00:30:30]  We had a little bit of a problem.  And you could have him from now on, by the way.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  I had a great drive.  We had a great time.  A lot of laughs.  We were laughing.  Let me tell you something.  Jim Norton is obviously a very good friend of ours now.  At first, yeah, you're going to have a good time.  You're going to have some laughs.  Some laughs.  And then he's going to get so effing annoying.  How does he get annoying?  And so uncomfortable that you're going to want to pass him along to somebody else.  What did he do to you that was annoying?  It's going to be Ben's turn next.  I'm telling you. 
[00:31:00]  Give me an instance.  Well, why don't you tell the rest stop story?  Oh.  Those cute little situations where you...  All right.  I did forget about that.  Where you're convinced that you're going to get your ass kicked.  Well, first time it's fun.  But after a while, you're like, oh, my God.  One of these times, someone's going to knock my teeth out because of him.  We pull up to a rest stop.  And it's one of those with the huge bathrooms that the truckers use.  Yeah.  Maybe to shower in and whatnot.  And there's some burly, surly trucker. 
[00:31:30]  Just like Jimmy in the Spider-Man movie.  And he's standing there.  And Jimmy is standing by one of the toilet...  What do you call the stalls?  And I'm standing out washing my hands.  Jimmy goes, oh, sir?  And ducks into a stall.  So now the guy is standing there.  He turns and looks at me.  Because I'm the only guy there.  So, okay.  Jimmy got me.  And I'm just washing my hands like, I didn't say it, so I'm not acknowledging. 
[00:32:00]  That's not that big of a deal, right?  Not that big a deal.  That's how he always starts, though.  It's always cute and fun.  Then the trucker starts disrobing.  He's taking his pants off.  He's standing there with his pants off, with his grayed fruit of the looms, his yam bag just like, like, hanging down.  And what does Norton do?  He must have been changing.  Because he wasn't trying to be a pervert.  You sure?  What time was it, Ant?  They'd have the time in the stall.  Be here at 11.05 p.m. if you want a... 
[00:32:30]  And you just happened to be the only guy in the stall that time?  It was about 2.33 in the morning.  Outside the stall, shaking his pants.  He wasn't being like a...  He was changing his pants.  What movie was that from?  Dumb and Dumber.  Cam Neely.  Yeah, Cam Neely.  That was hilarious.  At this point, the man has his pants off in a men's room at a truck stop, and Jimmy goes...  2.30 in the morning.  That's a normal life.  2.30 in the morning.  Jimmy goes...  It's quiet.  You can hear a pin drop.  Jimmy goes, nice.  Loud and clear. 
[00:33:00]  Well, he's bent over.  He's bent over, taking like the last...  Taking his foot out of the leg of the pants.  You know, you've got to kind of bend over to grab your pant leg and pull it.  His graying boxer or a brief...  Nice.  And I'm just like, you know, now I'm not even bothering with drawing my hands or anything.  Just leave.  Flee the seam.  I do understand how that could get a little much.  A little much.  I wasn't expecting on bumping into anybody at that hour.  I like traveling between like midnight and 4 a.m. 
[00:33:30]  Good traveling time.  That's a great traveling time.  You know, before you go on with the other stuff, we've got to back up a couple more days.  You've got to tell everyone Jim Norton's other trick that he does.  We're at that restaurant, Mexicano, on the east side.  Oh, my God.  He's so embarrassing.  And we went out after one of the shows this week.  And we had to wait at the restaurant right at the reception area.  You know, where the hostess stands because the table wasn't ready.  There were a lot of people.  Very busy restaurant.  So there's a lot of people huddled around. 
[00:34:00]  And you've got to kind of find your own room.  And people are passing through.  So it's a very crowded area of the restaurant while we're standing there.  And Jimmy does this thing where he will lean right over where he is pretty much his mouth is by the back of a man's head.  Where it looks like Jimmy's talking to the guy.  Mere inches away from his earlobe.  Yeah.  He goes, I've been gay for like four months now.  And then he spins around real quick before the guy can turn. 
[00:34:30]  And he's talking to me.  So now the guy, obviously, he thought Jimmy was talking to him.  So he spins around to look.  He realizes what Jimmy said.  And now he looks and sees Jimmy wasn't talking to him.  I don't know how he figured he was that loud.  Right next to his ear.  Well, he's talking to me.  But now the guy's like, oh, that's the guy that's gay for four months now.  And that must be his new boyfriend.  That must be his new boyfriend.  Or the guy that just propositioned him.  He is so embarrassing.  The best is when there's a chick there.  I love doing this one. 
[00:35:00]  Because they're all just standing around.  And when there's a crowd, you just start talking to your friend.  I'm like, yeah, I don't care if she's pregnant.  I'll just punch her in the stomach.  Yeah.  He says things like this really loud.  And he says it to you.  So people that are looking going, who are these despicable people?  Just a one sentence, a little line like that.  Yeah, because it's not just one guy that's despicable.  It's both of you.  Or in the elevator, you'll be standing there.  And the doors will open right when new people start walking in.  He goes, so I'm taking the medication for it.  But it's AIDS. 
[00:35:30]  You know, there's no cure.  Yeah, I'm not telling her.  It's none of her business.  Yeah, it's none of her business.  I'm not telling her.  Hey, I still got to get along with my life.  The best is cutting a gaster when you walk off the elevator.  Like, I've caught Opie and his girlfriend on the elevator about four times.  And as you walk off, because there's other people, really loud.  And then the doors close.  And they're stuck.  And everybody knows.  One time I was going up in the elevator with Sandy.  We were in Boston or whatever.  We had to grab something.  And she's on a higher floor than me.  So there's a guy on the elevator.  And I'm talking to her to make sure that he knows that I know her.  Yeah.  And as I'm getting off, I rip a really loud one. 
[00:36:00]  And the doors close.  And she's stuck with this guy.  Oh, my God.  You are horrible.  He says things like, I don't care.  Yeah, I got AIDS.  But I'm not using a rubber.  And the people that are just walking on the elevator.  And he's talking to you.  And I swear to God, I will just look forward.  Like, he's not talking to me.  He's talking to himself.  I am not acknowledging that this man is actually talking to me.  No way.  Classic.  So embarrassing.  So we're driving last night and having a great time. 
[00:36:30]  A little chit-chat going on.  A lot of fun.  Laughing.  Laughing.  It's very foggy.  And we're driving down 95 from Philly to D.C.  And I swear to God, how fast, Norton?  About 90, 95 miles a minute.  96.  96.  A couple of times I hit 100 and went, better back off a bit.  And Norton goes, you got a radar detector?  I'm like, no.  I am from the school of use the force, Luke.  Remember how in the original Star Wars, everyone's trying to shoot down the vent to blow up the Death Star, and they're all using those gadgets? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Can't do that.  I work off of looking ahead and to the side.  I will just go fast.  I don't care.  If I get pulled over, I'll deal with it.  You're just assuming that the cops down in the D.C. area like us as much as they do in New York.  You got me.  Exactly.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  But in western Pennsylvania, you're 75, 65, but, you know, whoever this guy is, he's 90.  Besides, the cruiser you drive these days helps as well.  Right.  I put the bubble on top.  Woo!  I just start going.  Cops in other states, they don't pull over cruisers often. 
[00:37:30]  Well, now I have the FBI credential, so I could go anywhere in the country.  Anthony is so connected, it is ridiculous.  And my FBI...  I think he could officially arrest people now.  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  You should see the stuff he has.  Like, most people will pull out their PBA cards.  Yeah.  And look, hey, look what I got, man.  I got a PBA.  He's got placards and pants.  I pull out shields.  I'm crazy.  And special license plates.  I'm insane.  I'm like what Nixon appointed Elvis to the DEA. 
[00:38:00]  That's like me.  I remember Elvis was going around arresting people and pulling them over.  Hey, you better slow down there.  You better slow down.  Speaking of Elvis, there's a decoupage of Elvis above your head for whatever reason.  And down here in D.C.  That's fascinating.  Go ahead.  We're making great time.  And you know me.  I love making great time.  And I'll say he's a good driver, too.  I got to give credit.  He's a safe driver.  I didn't feel nervous.  He was really flying.  I'm Sammy safe, but I'm also Phil Fast.  Yeah.  What's wrong with my driving?  I didn't say the other thing with your driving. 
[00:38:30]  I see what you're getting at.  What's wrong with my driving?  Compare the two drivers, Norton.  I'm biased.  How do you feel?  Oh, wait.  You guys discussed my driving.  No, absolutely not.  I know how he is.  Absolutely not.  What's wrong with my driving?  How would you compare the two?  Your driving was...  You're both very safe drivers.  You're, Ops and Morgan, likely to take the scenic route.  Look, the leaves are changing.  Oh, okay.  I'm strictly business on the road.  Yeah, you're about...  I'm all get point A to point B for the guy.  Look, I got a dump building up.  Let's go.  That's why I get so annoyed when the directions are wrong or something is amiss. 
[00:39:00]  Now, anybody who knows the location of our grand capital, Washington, D.C., knows it's a few miles south of Baltimore.  Correct?  Fifteen miles, I think.  About 15 miles or so south of Baltimore.  Around there somewhere.  Whatever.  Remember, when I noticed a sign that said we were on 495, 44 miles south of Baltimore, now heading north, I was like... 
[00:39:30]  Jimmy actually brought it up.  He goes, hey, where are we going?  What?  I go, I don't know, but I'm going real fast.  And we realized...  Oh, you got stuck in the circle.  Oh, that loop.  Yes, there's a huge loop that will just go around in circles.  No way.  And if it didn't loop, we'd have been in Georgia before we realized that there was a problem.  We started coming back north, and I'm like, then my string of curses come out.  I have a limit that I reach, and I will... 
[00:40:00]  You hear it on the air in letters, the S, F, C, sucking, D, F.  You got some nice curse combos, I got to give it to you.  Some of the best curse combos I've ever heard.  Thank you.  Yes.  I ramble them off, one after the other.  What great rage that was.  I was so pissed.  He was not cursing at anyone in particular, just the injustice of it all.  I'm pissed at the moment.  I'm pissed at the moment.  Oh, is that what boss does?  Boss bites his arm.  Boss bites his own arm. 
[00:40:30]  He has actually driven up to me and go, I was biting my arm.  And he's got little teeth prints from his little mouth on his little arm.  On his little midget arm.  He bites his own arm.  That's wonderful.  I hit the steering wheel.  I curse.  I'm like...  And then I just resign myself.  Like, I'm like, S, F, C, D...  Ah, what the hell am I going to do?  This really...  And then I'm like, this...  I got to specify. 
[00:41:00]  This really sucks.  And he's sick, so he's got...  Oh, yeah.  He's driving with a piece...  It was awful.  I got tissue stuffed up my nose.  It was like driving with Jake LaMotta after Robinson punched him in the face.  It was like, would you blow your nose or pick it and do something?  I couldn't.  Nothing would come out, but it was clogged and it would just drip at a moment's notice.  It was just an old box face with a tampon hanging out.  It was brutal.  It was just hanging out of his nose for 60 miles of the cliff.  I couldn't blow my nose because nothing would come out. 
[00:41:30]  But then out of nowhere, it was like you turn on a faucet and I'd get the...  Whip.  Whip.  Yeah.  So I figure I'll just shove a tissue in there and drive.  Don't look so disgusted.  Bite your goddamn arm.  Well, what's the matter?  What's wrong, Rich?  He doesn't pick it and wipe it on a cigarette butt, you awful man.  What?  The boogers he picks, all right?  I know this is...  Oh, my God.  Those little...  Maybe they just look bigger because his fingers are so small.  But they...  They dangle.  They dangle and he puts them on a cigarette butt and he goes... 
[00:42:00]  And he throws out the window.  Boss is a gross, awful man.  Now that's good.  Classic.  He laughs at it before he disposes on it.  Oh, he knows.  And they dangle.  He's like...  Oh!  Oh!  It's like stalactite.  Or stalactite.  I always get those two confused, don't you?  Of course you do.  Classic.  Give the thumbs up.  Oh, you already are.  Sorry.  Oh, okay. 
[00:42:30]  Well, he's missing a knuckle.  He can't help it.  He's missing a knuckle on every single finger on both hands.  A little hand.  Hey, Ed, we've got to stop you there.  Yeah.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  The phones are going crazy.  Juan from D.C. saw a limo with wow on it filled with chicks going to WJFK.  Oh, really?  Uh, how do the listeners get here, by the way?  What's the...  Good luck.  Is someone farting?  I couldn't even figure out.  What was that noise?  She's opening his zipper.  Oh.  Uh, is there an address or something we can give the folks? 
[00:43:00]  Here, Ben.  And where's Steve real fast?  Steve went outside to check out what we got so far for this contest.  Yeah.  And, uh, there's one girl out there.  She's got a shirt that just says, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Really?  All printed out nice and stuff.  Nice.  Got it, Ben.  It's, uh, 108-00 Main Street, Fairfax, Virginia.  Do that again?  108, then two doubles, two zeros after that, Main Street.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  That water on the side.  Looks like an aquarium.  Fairfax, Virginia. 
[00:43:30]  You can see the, for those people that, you can see out the window here and look at traffic  going by.  It's kind of cool.  We're used to being perched high above Midtown Manhattan.  And we get to see girls showering, but this is, uh, this is fun, too.  Yeah, it's good.  Yeah, traffic out here is pretty bad, huh?  I'll get it.  Well, look at that guy with tissue in his nose.  Shut up.  Look at that guy biting his arm and throwing boogers on cigarette butts out the window.  Oh, they're awful.  All right, we'll get Steve in here.  I guess he didn't hear us, so he'll, uh, he'll check in after the break to see what 
[00:44:00]  we got.  We got that trip to Hollywood to give away for the person that brings down the strangest  thing today.  Good luck beating Philly.  Good effing luck.  Speaking of which, if you're just tuning in, uh, the Dead Monkey Hummer pictures are  now up on foundrymusic.com.  Oh, you gotta see them.  I do believe they will not be up there too long, so you should go there immediately.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music dot com.  And that link is off, uh, opiananthony.com as well, okay?  Right!  Mother's Day right around the corner.  We're gonna, we're gonna go into the ONA archives and play some of our Hi Moms today, 
[00:44:30]  Anthony.  This is one of my faves of all time.  Hi Mom, I'm in porno.  Hi Michelle, you wanna play Hi Mom?  Yes, I do.  Alright, I, I hear you wanna play Hi Mom, I'm in porno.  Yeah.  Yeah!  Awesome!  Now, where's your mom live?  Montana.  Well, what are you doing in Boston?  I'm a nanny.  You're a nanny?  Cool.  Maybe you could tell your mom you lost your job as a nanny and you had to make ends  meet, so you, uh, you jumped into porno.  Okay.  Alright, I got your mom's number.  I'm giving her the call right now.  Okay.  Nutrition Center. 
[00:45:00]  Hi, can I speak to Jean, please?  Is this Michelle?  Yes, it is.  It's important.  Okay, hold on, hon.  Uh-huh.  Now, play it up.  Say you lost your job, you had no other choice.  Okay.  You were all alone.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  I have a problem.  I lost my job.  Why?  Because I just wasn't doing it.  I couldn't cope with it, you know.  I thought you said it was going great.  It was, but things just fell apart.  I'm having a really hard time, so, um, I didn't tell you sooner because I was too scared 
[00:45:30]  to, but, um, and now I got a different job, but I'm doing, I don't know how to tell you  this.  What?  I'm doing, I'm doing porn movies.  No.  Yes?  No.  Mom?  No.  What?  I, it's too late.  No.  Mom?  No.  Um, I'll, you, hold on.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus. 
[00:46:00]  I think she believes you.  I'm shaking.  Michelle?  Yeah?  Where can I reach you?  Um, I have, I have like three days to get out of here, so I don't-  You don't do that.  What?  Don't do what you told me.  Well, what am I going to do?  How am I going to get home?  You don't have money in the bank?  Well, yeah, but I kind of had to use some of it to get this rolling.  I had to get an agent.  No, you don't.  Where, where can I call you?  Same number, but Mom?  What?  There's something else I have to tell you.  Happy Mother's Day. 
[00:46:30]  I love you.  This is just a joke.  I'm on the radio.  Oh, my God.  It's a radio program.  Oh.  I just wanted to let you know that I love you.  Oh, my God.  I'm thinking about you.  Mom?  You know, I think those things are so funny when they happen to other people.  I mean, I would sit and listen to them all day long because they're so funny, but that,  you killed me.  Oh, my God.  Mom?  Wait, Mom.  We're really nice.  Okay.  I am going to kill you. 
[00:47:00]  I love you.  New York Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony are now on the air.  Welcome to the wonderful world of Balloon Not Pleasure.  Yeah, if you need lube, you're a loser.  Take it like a champ, okay?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Threading like AIDS in Haiti.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  Ah!  It's Friday!  We don't have our Friday part down here, man. 
[00:47:30]  I love that every Friday.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, including D.C., 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  It's shaping up to be a very nice show today, Anthony.  Yes, yes, yes.  We're going to go out into the parking lot in a couple minutes here.  Steve from foundrymusic.com is outside helping us go through all the stuff. 
[00:48:00]  People are bringing down to the station.  We're going to invite some of these people in.  And the grand prize today is going to be a trip to Hollywood to see Poison and stuff.  So it's going to be tough to actually beat out Philly.  He's now called Dead Monkey Hummer Guy.  Dead Monkey Hummer Guy.  And the pictures are up on foundrymusic.com.  I think for the first time since foundrymusic.com has been online, we crashed it.  It crashed?  People are losing their minds trying to get the pictures from yesterday's Philly show, Anthony. 
[00:48:30]  Who wouldn't want to see Dead Monkey Hummer Guy?  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  That link is off opiananthony.com, okay?  Remember when the guy ate the spleen up there in Boston?  Remember when a cancer doctor came in and threw that big cancerous breast up on the console?  And you guys copped a feel off of cancer breast?  You've got to poke at cancer a little bit.  And we're sitting there going, all right, we know we're going to Philly, then Washington. 
[00:49:00]  There's no way that they could beat it.  But, well, yesterday in Philly, when a gentleman came up and put his mule in a dead monkey's mouth, grabbed the back of its head and started going to town.  Right then I said, all right.  Now we thought there was no way that Philly could beat Boston and New York.  And what is that called?  Necro-bestiality-philia?  Yeah.  Hot.  I confess, it's hot. 
[00:49:30]  Speaking of hot.  It's called a night out in Harlem.  The girls just walk down the street like that all the time?  Or are they here to see us?  A limo just pulled up with some of the hottest girls I've seen.  Well, that wasn't a lie.  And two of them just went by.  What are they doing walking by instead of coming in here?  Come on.  They'll be in a few minutes.  Wow.  We're at 10,800, 10,800.  What?  I'm a loser, I am.  Well, how else do you say this?  I don't know.  What is that address? 
[00:50:00]  It's 10,800, or that's one thing.  So it's like 10,800 Main Street, Fairfax, right?  Good luck getting in the cab, getting there.  I know.  Good luck.  But that's where we are.  And there's a party going on outside the studio right now.  Matter of fact, let's check in with Steve from foundrymusic.com and see what's going on.  Steve!  Hello, fellas.  Hey, what's up, brother?  I'm sitting here in the parking lot of WJFK Studios surrounded by easily 100 criminals.  Nice.  It is criminals and actually a large female contingent.  Oh, really? 
[00:50:30]  Surprisingly good-looking females have shown up.  Oh, females.  I thought you said a large female.  I was going to have to.  No, sorry.  She is.  Sorry.  You know what's interesting?  Allow me to rephrase.  Perhaps we haven't been on the air here long enough to frighten away the girls yet,  Opie.  Completely valid.  There's still hope for us.  Amen.  Hey, man, we love our guy fans, but jeez.  You did a hot girl out there with a Norton sign that I actually gave a hug to.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yeah, my hand accidentally brushed her breasts.  Accidentally.  It really was an accident.  She accidentally signed a criminal complaint against you. 
[00:51:00]  Did you have to accidentally punch me in the gums?  Well, you know, it's hot.  I'm sorry, Steve.  Oh, no, please.  It's all right, Steve.  Sorry.  You're taking a look out there and seeing what the people are bringing down.  What do you got so far?  Very early on in the game, we have what I consider to be a pretty large home run.  There's a guy here that brought two very large boxes in which were those Kathleen put your  goddamn clothes back on t-shirts that I just handed you.  Yes, I have one right here.  Really fascinating stuff. 
[00:51:30]  Is there anyone that doesn't know what Kathleen put your goddamn clothes back on means?  I don't think so.  I think everyone knows.  I think everyone knows.  I think everyone has known for a very long time, right?  You'd have to be so far out of the loop.  Stinky rules!  Stinky rules.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead, Steve.  What's your name?  Andrew Gore.  Andrew, where are you from?  Washington, D.C.  Andrew, why don't you rattle off some of the wonderful things you brought?  I brought a Jeffrey Dahmer play set.  What is that?  What's a Jeffrey Dahmer play set? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, my.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Sorry.  It is a stuffed replica of Jeffrey Dahmer out of his and out of the prison issue uniform  that Jeffrey Dahmer is wearing is sticking ahead of a young black man.  It's Cleotis.  Oh, it's Cleotis.  Okay.  Okay.  Dude, it's.  And we have all.  And in the trash can, along with the Jeffrey Dahmer doll, is a label that says leftovers.  What is that?  It's, it's basically a stuffed Jeffrey Dahmer doll with dismembered pieces that come along 
[00:52:30]  with it.  All right.  Okay.  Interesting.  That's one.  All right.  What else you got?  I got some presents for the boys.  Presents for you guys, obviously.  A pickled punk pillow.  A pickled punk pillow.  What is that?  A pickled punk pillow is a pillow with two conjoined fetuses emblazoned upon it.  It's a life size.  And another one with a baby with two heads that looks like it's been silkscreened on it as  well.  Where did this guy go to?  The sharper image for his strange stuff? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  I guess he's a collector.  Another.  Oh, my Lord.  There's a picture.  Uh, hmm.  There is another pillow with a silkscreen of a man with a very large, uh.  Mule?  Uh, no.  No.  The other.  Yambag?  Uh, the, uh.  The berries.  The yambag.  Yambag.  Thank you, fellas.  Well, this guy's got cool tattoos, though.  Guy's covered in tattoos.  He's got some cool ones.  He, uh.  Also, where's the, uh, the other weird stuff you brought?  You told me about some other weird ones.  I just want to take a look.  There's some, some items in jars that, uh. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  He brought along with them as well.  Uh, one of which he has told me is a two-headed kitten.  A two-headed kitten.  A two-headed kitten in a jar.  I think that's the thing we want to see, right?  Oh, yeah.  That is definitely the thing you want to see.  All the other stuff is kind of, uh.  That's cute.  Cutesy.  I'd like to see the other stuff.  Well.  Oh, you'll definitely see it, Jim.  Yeah, we'll see it.  But we gotta, like, uh, get right to the chase here.  Okay.  And in another big, large mayonnaise-type jar is, oh.  A pig with one head and two bodies.  What is that again?  It's a pig with one head and two bodies. 
[00:54:00]  One head, two bodies?  Pig with one head and two bodies.  All right.  Tickled in a jar.  Where did he get those two things from?  Where did he get stuff like this?  Thornton's hotel room?  I'm just pretty much a collector, and I get stuff from all over the world.  Pickled freak animals.  It's a collector.  Gets it from all over the world.  Has a couple of boxes.  I suggest we bring this gentleman in to take a look at this stuff.  Yeah, well, uh, yeah.  Bring him right down.  He's so hot.  All right, Steve.  We'll see you in a few minutes, okay?  Okay, man.  You got it.  I hear a contender is on the way, though.  That might beat out the, uh, monkey thing.  It's a Gary Condit, and he's gonna get, uh, oral from dead Chandra Levy. 
[00:54:30]  Which, uh, that's a winner right there.  Look at you getting local.  That's what I see.  Look at me.  Get all local.  I thought you were gonna say that he was, uh, bringing her head in a box.  Well, sure.  Why not?  Or put it in one.  Right.  Whatever.  Whatever it takes.  Very nice.  All right, so back to the Watergate Hotel, Anthony.  Oh, damn.  We were talking about our little trip.  So we got lost.  Uh, we don't wind up getting to the, uh, we get to the Watergate.  I don't know.  It's, it's gotta be four in the morning. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, it's late.  Very late, Opie.  I'm sick.  Uh, and then we check.  It's a second.  Wonderful hotel, by the way.  It's, it's a nice place.  A lot of history there, by the way.  Uh, I don't think anybody in the country got, uh, everyone knows the Watergate Hotel.  It was at Boris Gump.  I know.  Right near the, the monument there?  I was with a girl in the parking lot.  And then I told her it was sold out.  Voss.  We're gonna put Voss in his own little studio in a few minutes, by the way.  You see that little box over there with the, the glass window?  We're putting you in, in that for the rest of the show. 
[00:55:30]  Behind the glass.  And all you gotta do the whole show is just laugh.  Oh!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's great.  Oh, Voss is a funny laugh.  Voss has a funny laugh.  Go ahead, Anthony.  They put us up in there, and, uh, it's a great hotel, you know.  They put us in, uh, fantastic rooms.  Um, I had a little trouble with my vehicle, though.  Go to park it, and, uh, there's a valet parking.  I'll be valet parking over there at the Watergate.  So I give the guy my keys, and, uh, I'm feeling very sick at this point.  I'm, I'm very miserable. 
[00:56:00]  I'm pissed off.  And, uh, I took some, some of those five-day antibiotics.  You know, you take the two on day one, and then you take, uh, uh, four separate ones  on the next five days.  Could be some side effects.  Could be some side effects.  One side effect, Opie, explosive diarrhea.  The type, the type where, as you're sitting on the throne, you, you know, there's no turning 
[00:56:30]  back.  You know this is going to be ugly, and you just got to get it over with as quickly as  possible.  It's so bad that when you get up, it looks like you, you rode your, your 10-speed through  a mud puddle.  Threw a mud puddle.  Remember that?  When you, you had your 10-speed, and you rode it through the mud puddle, you got home and  look in the mirror and go, hey, look, I got the mud strip up my back.  That's what the back of the, your shirt looks like?  You go, you run your, uh, hand through the back of your hair and go, well, I got mud in  my hair.  There's little flecks in it.  Little flecks. 
[00:57:00]  Flecks.  Yes, that was the sound.  Here's the microphone live from the bathroom to the water gate.  Well, they mic'd everything over there.  All right.  Okay.  Different type of plumbers getting into the water gate to clean up the mess I made.  The plumbers.  Letting get the plunger.  Horrible.  So, uh, I get, I, uh, I get in there, and, uh, at six in the morning, I finally get to 
[00:57:30]  sleep.  At six thirty, they call up to the room and say that, why is my truck blocking the valet  entrance?  Please bring the keys down.  Yeah, I finally got to sleep after my stomach was percolating.  Hey, very nice.  Wow.  Sorry.  Ladies.  Girls were flashing us through the window, and Jim Norton just had a heart attack.  So I had to, uh, and inform the people that we had given the keys already. 
[00:58:00]  And, uh, do you know what time it is?  At which point they said, uh, it was six thirty, uh, we're sorry to disturb you, and hung up.  I was so pissed off.  After another run to the bathroom to make another, uh, mud strip up my back, I go to get into  bed, and this is after getting lost, after everything, I lay down in bed and crack my  skull on the headboard.  The big, wooden, lovely Watergate headboard. 
[00:58:30]  So now I am so pissed, I make a fist with my right hand and punch the headboard as hard  as I can.  And, uh, after we leave the station today, I will be going to the hospital for x-rays on  my broken right hand.  You're convinced it's broken?  Yeah.  Look at, look at the pinky knuckle.  Oh, yeah.  Compared to, uh, the other one.  That doesn't look good.  The fact that your sign turned, was turned around on your door right after it didn't bother  you?  That it was said, do not disturb, and it was turned around to make up room early? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, yeah, Jimmy Norton turned my, my do not disturb sign around to read, uh, please  make up room early.  This son of a bitch is impossible.  Didn't you start the show saying you enjoy hanging out with him?  Now you're starting to get it.  Well, I'm seeing some of the-  Now you're starting to get it.  Some of the little things he does that are funny at the moment.  Only an hour and a half into the show you're going, he's impossible.  They're funny at the moment.  Why do you think I passed him along to you, finally?  That's all right, I signed him up for the, uh, 6.30 breakfast. 
[00:59:30]  Most.  He didn't pass.  Those little things we do.  Little things.  He hoped it was heard.  He wanted me to go with him.  He's like, are you not going tomorrow?  You were not happy.  You wanted me to-  Ah, we like, uh, uh, road tripping with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I turned you on to all the weird music I like.  I got it.  The cake I like.  I turned him on to some cake there.  Cake?  You liked cake?  I really enjoyed it.  All right, go ahead, Anthony.  So I was just having a, a little bit of a hard time last night.  It was rough, you know?  It's, uh, but it's a great hotel, full of history, which I enjoy. 
[01:00:00]  I'm kind of, the thing that pisses me off about it, I was hoping to steal some great Watergate hotel stuff.  They, they know better.  They know not to put it on the towels or, you know, ashtrays around the place because people steal it.  It's a Swiss hotel.  Yeah.  When I pulled in, I'm like, oh, uh, we're in the wrong parking lot.  Yeah, this isn't the Watergate.  This isn't the Watergate.  And then I look out the window and I see the whole Watergate complex and I'm like, who is the little busybody that ratted out Liddy and his guys?  Like, you look at a window and if you saw flashlights in the window or something like that or, you know, I saw a taped open door, would you bother anybody? 
[01:00:30]  A little guard walking around, pushing doors.  A little busybody got Tricky Dick in trouble.  Should have left him alone.  I want to do that as a goof.  Just tape open all the doors.  Ha, ha, ha.  Call up security.  Hello?  I was running around with a flashlight laughing alone.  So we, we realized the guys that run the hotel don't have any clue about it because Norton called up for directions when we were lost.  And, uh, what did you say about, uh, Liddy, G. Gordon, Liddy? 
[01:01:00]  Do you guys have room service 24 hours?  Because I like to check before I get to a place where I'll stop and bring food.  And the guy's like, yeah, I'm like, oh, because my friend G. Gordon Liddy said that you guys might not have it.  And he's like, no, no, we haven't because he was foreign.  Nothing.  Nothing.  No, no, we haven't.  He didn't, but he didn't get it.  I wasn't expecting a laugh.  He should have at least been a little annoyed.  He should have gone like, ah, ha, I get it.  Like, you'd think they get that all the time.  Again, he would have been perfect in Philadelphia.  Yeah, I was going to say, maybe once again, it was the timing.  Aw.  Like, one of the listeners said, you know, no, never mind.  The joke stunk.  The joke, let's be honest, not to go back, but I have to compliment some guy that wrote in. 
[01:01:30]  My joke stunk last night, and some guy wrote in that joke could have had the timing of an atomic clock,  and it still wouldn't have gotten a laugh because it was awful.  Who wrote that?  That's really funny.  That's what I was trying to find, but all right.  Awful.  What?  Were you finishing up with the water game?  I guess I was.  It's kind of, that's all.  That's all I had.  They have a broken hand.  You're sick.  I'm sick.  And you got explosive diarrhea, which is nice.  Well, I hope it went away. 
[01:02:00]  I think it's gone.  I think we're all hoping.  What are you doing?  He's pulling his pants down.  Oh.  And mooning Stinky in the other room.  Stinky rules!  Stinky rules!  Catchphrase of the new millennium.  Yeah.  On radio stations all over the country.  All right, so that's where we're at.  Yeah.  What were those broads?  You got that guy?  Yeah.  Let's bring in the first guy, Anthony.  Bring him in.  We're giving away a two-night, three-day trip for two to Hollywood to attend an exclusive end-of-tour party with Poison at the Roxy Theater. 
[01:02:30]  Maybe I shouldn't try to read this real fast.  Trip is courtesy of VH1 Classic, the new 24-hour music network.  We're just looking for the strangest thing you can bring to us as we broadcast live from WJFK here in the outskirts of D.C., Anthony.  Do it like you're a Hotwire read.  No, I can't.  Poison at Hollywood.  All you ever do on reads is set him up to go, Anthony!  I'm not stupid.  That goes back to what I was expecting yesterday as being slappy.  A little bizarre.  The beard, you mean. 
[01:03:00]  What's going on?  There's a lot of weirdness going on with this guy.  Jesus.  We're at 10-800.  That's all like one number.  10,800 Main Street in Fairfax if you want to stop by and join the party.  Quite a few eyebrow piercings you got there.  Thank you, sir.  How many of those would you say you have in that one eyebrow?  11.  11?  I used to have 13, but two of them grew out.  Grew out.  Migrate to the surface.  Right, like a flounder's eye.  Yes.  And he's got the ear.  How many in the ear?  16.  16. 
[01:03:30]  16 holes in the ear.  You don't got that Prince Albert thing going, do you?  No, not too weird to me.  Yeah, all the way.  And who's the lovely young lady?  My assistant, Tracy.  Assistant.  I love the T-shirt.  Thank you.  It says, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  I hope you made them.  Professionally made, too.  Nice.  We're used to our listeners just taking a white T-shirt and a Sharpie and writing something,  but that's nice.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  And you brought some strange items.  Yes, I brought a...  I'm an artist out of D.C., and I'm pretty much banned by all major auction sites on the 
[01:04:00]  web, so I'd like to give Jim the Piku Domer place.  A Piku Domer doll.  Yeah, it's a little doll, and...  This will be easy to get back to New York.  I know.  And then I know how much you guys like the Pickle Punk, so I brought just some Pickle  Punk pillows.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  Oh, that's an actual real picture of one.  Yeah, we'll put that on the Ikea furniture back in New York.  Yeah.  And here's another one.  One for you guys.  Oh, very nice.  Thank you.  Yep, cuddle up with that.  Sure.  And then for Norton, I brought the elephantitis of the... 
[01:04:30]  Wow.  Of the Yambick.  Look at the size of that guy's nads.  God, how big and delicious.  How did they get that big?  This is going up in my apartment, right against the old couch.  Hey, whore, put your face on this.  It's called layback on the sack.  Oh, there you go.  All right, what else you got there?  I live with Florentine.  That will make me think of him.  We got a John Wayne Gacy school pennant.  Oh, pennant.  You know what?  Norton needs that. 
[01:05:00]  Norton.  John Wayne Gacy.  Norton needs that.  That's a great goal team.  Your eyes lit up.  Yeah.  My ears are a clown.  It's like most people have put a banner like that that say the name of their favorite sports team.  And then so does this.  John Wayne Gacy.  Oh, headmaster.  God, this is good, dude.  Thank you.  All right, what else you got?  Since I gave you all babies, they need little bibs.  So here's some of the bibs that I make.  Yikes.  Do you sell this stuff somewhere? 
[01:05:30]  Yes, sir.  Where?  On my website.  That is an actual baby bib?  Yes.  Give out the website real fast.  www.satansideshow.com  Satansideshow.com.  Wow, this is great stuff, man.  And we have that one.  You can wear that one tonight.  Don't bother me.  I'm taking a dump.  Very nice.  This one says, yikes, seeing an ugly mother F like you makes me wish your mommy would have  had an abortion.  That's like a baby's bib.  Yeah, and it's a baby's bib. 
[01:06:00]  Perfect for hands like Voss.  Hear it.  That's cute.  Adorable.  And we have one that I like to wear to the clubs.  I'm hung like a horsey on the little baby's bib.  That's wonderful.  And then for Jim, I brought some of my period panties.  Those are panties?  And what's special about those?  When it's that time of the month.  So we've got the tuna fish.  There's a tuna can on the front of those panties.  We have the disco come on down to funky town.  All right.  Might be a little funky down there. 
[01:06:30]  Those are big old lady bloomers.  Look at those things.  And my favorite one is this one.  What does that say?  Are you sure you want to be down here?  I just took a S.  Very nice.  A S.  Yeah.  And there's logs drawn on it.  Good boy.  Those are big old lady bloomer type underwear.  Great stuff.  Thanks.  Now let's see the stuff you had in the jar.  That's the stuff we'll...  That's the stuff we'll...  We'll enter in the contest.  The freaks.  Is that...  For the trip to Hollywood.  You're 0 for 2, Jim.  Yeah.  I'm keeping track.  I brought a bunch of crime memorabilia and freak show memorabilia. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, crime memorabilia.  Real crime memorabilia?  Real crime memorabilia.  What do you want to see first?  The crime memorabilia.  What do you got?  Angel.  Let's take a look.  We love crime.  You know what?  I'll tell you this one.  Save the best thing for last.  We will.  Okay.  Good job.  He's got a little FedEx envelope full of...  This is the Jim Jones, the Guiana murders.  You got pictures?  Yeah.  So what this is, is this all went...  A lot of the people who died in Guiana were from San Francisco. 
[01:07:30]  So I tracked down...  Howdy.  ...a gentleman whose grandparents died in Jonestown.  Yeah.  And I got the medallion that the grandfather was wearing and was taken off the body and  sent back to him.  Wow.  ...when I've ever seen...  Hey, that's pretty good.  Was it from Jim Jones?  Yeah.  There was the...  There was taken off...  The People's Temple.  Oh, that's what they all were wearing.  Yeah, they all...  Oh, okay.  Gotcha.  And I had them give me a little certificate of authenticity saying, this came out of my  dead grandparents.  Wow.  Laying down there, stinking up the joint, all dead. 
[01:08:00]  Full Newsweek.  Look at the cheeks on this one.  That's good.  I have no idea.  Cover of Newsweek, all the dead, bloated bodies.  It figures that the Jewish guy has to ask that.  How much can I get for it?  How much?  I also got one of Jim Jones' original business cards when he was a city housing commissioner  in San Francisco.  Hey, look at that.  A little crime, murder, death memorabilia.  What else there?  Let me see, Jimmy Norton.  Who knew?  He's opening up a box, Anthony.  He's opening up a box.  You guys are familiar with Richard Ramirez? 
[01:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes.  He's got teeth.  Yes, great guy.  These are these sunglasses that he wore during his trial that the press freaked out about  saying, oh, he thinks he's a rock star.  How'd you get those?  I got them from his wife.  Really?  Yes.  How did she give them up?  I was in touch with Richard, and I asked him.  You're one of those guys that get in touch with all the guys.  Do you have any Gacy paintings?  No, I was never a big Gacy fan.  Oh, not a big Gacy.  Why?  What did he do that didn't?  There was no sport and chilling like little boys. 
[01:09:00]  Well, speak for yourself.  Do you know Chuck Farnham?  No.  Okay.  Another one of our friends that kind of talks to the guys in the joint.  Oh.  They're the sunglasses he wore.  Dick Ramirez glasses.  He has the lock-up tag from the prison, and he actually got to sign it, too.  Wow.  Look at that.  And Jim has put them on.  What if it affects you, Jim?  Did you get a picture of me in these?  Nice.  How about that?  Look at that.  A little picture of you in the Richard Ramirez glasses. 
[01:09:30]  I've got the headphones on.  I probably look silly.  Oh, yeah.  That'll make the difference.  What other kind of, any more murder, death type memorabilia?  Dig in there.  Boss liked that one.  All right.  What else you got, bro?  I like this freaky stuff.  Yeah, definitely.  Do you have any Kemper stuff?  Brings it right there.  This is going to be, I think this stuff's going to be tough to beat right off the bat.  And then here is, I got to go up to the house we share and take out murdered.  Yeah.  Back in, I think, 93.  The band's Nine Inch Nails.  We're recording in there. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, really?  And they kind of heard about me.  And so I got a phone call and said, yeah, Andy, we know you're a big Manson fan and you  want to come up to the house because they were moving and they were going to tear the house  down to the people that own the property.  Who would do that?  So I got to go up there and I got to creep crawl the whole joint.  And here's like some uncensored crime scene photos of Sharon Tate.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Pestles.  Here, that's something.  How does it look, Jimmy?  Sexy.  Sexy.  Oh, wow. 
[01:10:30]  These were never published?  No.  You've seen better days.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That is...  Look, Chinatown.  That is very disturbing.  Steve is photographing everything for the website.  Let me see that one.  Wow.  Nice legs.  Oh, my God.  That is not attached.  Hey, Steve, see.  Let me see that one.  Pass that to Opie and then let him pass it back.  We're just passing murder pictures around.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, my goodness.  How come it looks like she's smiling?  Yeah, that's what's disturbing about those shots.  A little disturbing.  All right.  What else there, bro?  And here's a picture of me lying down in the exact spot where Sharon Tate got murdered  in the exact same position.  Look at this sick ass.  He's doing the same pose that we're seeing in the crime photograph.  Oh, you're awful.  You're as awful as Jim Norton, man.  You guys are going to get along just fine.  If you notice, I'm wearing a Sharon Tate maternity shirt that I made and have a pillow  up my shirt to give it the realistic effect.  So you kind of look pregnant. 
[01:11:30]  Yep.  Jim just found his new best friend.  Can you drive him back to New York because we don't want him.  Sure, not a problem.  All right.  What is that?  And then here's the door where they wrote pig and Sharon Tate's blood.  Yeah.  I was the first person to put pig on that door since the night of the murders.  Oh, so you put pig on the door.  And where's that door hanging out these days?  Is it still at the...  Trent owned it.  Oh, Trent owned it.  Okay.  I asked him if I could have it.  I think I planted the idea.  All right.  But, you know, it was his place, so...  This guy's pretty interesting.  Yeah, that's pretty sick.  He still hasn't pulled out the showstopper. 
[01:12:00]  No, no, that's okay.  His showstopper.  I kind of like the...  I kind of like this murder memorabilia stuff.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  Oh, wow.  What is that in a jar?  In my collection, this is Johnny and Joey, the two-headed kitten.  Johnny and Joey.  I love this type of stuff.  This is the type of stuff we saw in the Muter Museum up there in Philly.  Meow.  Meow.  Mudder.  Some people say mudder.  I say mutter.  His father was a mudder.  Look at that, Ant. 
[01:12:30]  I'm going to pass it.  It's very well preserved.  You see the fur of the kitten and everything.  The two-headed kitten.  Preserved in a little jar.  Look at the little guy.  One of them looks like a rosy guy.  Hey, you guys will place this nice and get really good photographs, right?  Okay, good.  All this stuff will be up on boundarymusic.com.  Meow.  What else?  Is that the showstopper?  No, that's chicken feed.  Hey, dude, what's that like coming out of the other cat's chin?  Well, I actually asked a vet and they didn't know.  It's just some kind of knot of cartilage.  Yeah, it looks like it could be a part of the other one's jaw or something. 
[01:13:00]  How long did this kitten live?  Do you have any idea?  I have no idea, but I just assumed it was born dead.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's got a little thing in the back.  It looks wild.  Dude, it looks like a human face.  Look right between the heads and the back.  Look at that.  Well, that might be a third kitten.  Like a third kitten's face or something.  You want to see it, Jimmy?  I sure do.  All right.  Pretty good.  All right.  I bet I do.  Are you reaching in for the last item?  No.  No? 
[01:13:30]  This is a pig with one head and two bodies.  And the ears have grown underneath its chin, so it looks like he's wearing a bow tie.  Oh, my God.  Look at that, Anthony.  It looks like the thing that was playing the flute-looking thing in the Star Wars cantina scene.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Perfect.  Isn't it?  A pig with two bodies with the ears growing right under the chin.  We're getting pictures of all this stuff.  Take them down.  Pass them around.  Yeah.  Be very careful, everybody.  Be very conscious of how you're handling this. 
[01:14:00]  Two-bodied pig.  That's great for you and your buddy after you've all been drinking.  Ah, just put your mule in.  Little tug.  That's great.  That is unbelievable.  Look at the snout on it.  Ugh.  And this is the showstopper?  No, sir.  This is a mummified fetus.  That's a fetus mummy.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Let me see.  All right.  Pass that on.  Be very careful, Opie.  Holy.  Look at that thing.  Oh, my.  Look at its big head.  How much you want for this?  Dude, we need this for New York.  Let me see.  It is a petrified baby fetus. 
[01:14:30]  How old is this fetus?  I would say...  Three months?  Four months old?  Yeah.  Probably right around there.  Maybe four months, Ant?  How old has it been like that?  Oh, that's probably about 70 years old.  Look at that.  It's dried like beef jerky, the whole fetus.  Yeah.  It's a whole mummified.  He doesn't have it in any fluids.  It's just in a jar, petrified.  Like it's holding its face.  How many inches, Ant, if you...  You know, it's in the fetal position.  You can't see between there.  It's probably... 
[01:15:00]  It would probably be what?  Seven, eight inches?  Actually, it is a boy.  No, more than...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eight inches, nine inches.  It's in the fetal position.  And it's petrified.  And this isn't the showstopper?  No, sir.  Look, Voss owes it money and it's dodging.  Hey, look.  The hands are the same size.  That is...  That is...  Where did you get that from?  That was actually out of an old showman's collection.  It toured Carnival Circuits.  See, I missed those old side shows.  And all the formaldehyde evaporated and it ended up just mummifying. 
[01:15:30]  Mummifying.  That is amazing.  All right.  And this isn't his showstopper, Ant.  Where do you get stuff like this, though?  Like on the internet?  No, no, no.  I'm a private collector.  I collect stuff from all over the world.  Do you have stuff in your collection that you would not dare even mention?  Who's that criminal?  You do.  Stuff that might be illegal to possess?  I wouldn't say illegal, but it just, you know, I like to keep a low profile.  What's something that you have that you would consider, like, really one of your prized possessions? 
[01:16:00]  Well, I brought that with me.  Oh, you did?  Decided to risk it just for you guys.  All right.  Wait, can I interrupt everyone?  Yeah.  Does that guy have a gun?  What the hell is he doing?  There are people just...  He's fouling us.  There's a big black guy flashing us.  Albert.  What's up, Albert?  It's Albert.  Yeah.  Not too distracting.  All right.  Here's the showstopper, Anthony.  Oh, it is?  No?  Yes?  Oh, my God.  Oh! 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  Oh, nice!  Holy jeez.  Look at Junior.  What is that?  This is probably the rarest deformity of a fetus.  This is a cyclops.  I see it!  It was billed as the cyclops elephant girl.  If you notice that thing in her forehead, it's actually her nose.  That's her nose on her forehead?  Yeah.  Right above her one eyeball?  Right.  Wow.  High.  It's full term, and it toured, I would say it's probably about 80 years old. 
[01:17:00]  80 years old.  All over the country.  And if you notice, the jar has a chain and a bracket on it, and this is what the carnies  would lock it down with, so...  So no one would, like you, would steal it.  Exactly.  You could grab onto that handle on the head.  Go to town.  You want to...  Could you bring that over here?  I don't want to pass it around or anything, because I'm sure it's one of your prized possessions.  Well, I'm just placing it right down there, and let me get a good look.  All we need is the monkey guy from yesterday, and D.C. will beat Philly.  How is that a nose? 
[01:17:30]  That is amazing.  Oh, my God.  It's like an alien.  Look at the tussleable hair, though, Jimmy, right?  Don't you want to just reach in and tussle?  I want to tussle and grab its nose and go, phant.  Was this baby born and living for a while?  No, it was born dead.  It was born dead.  Look at the area.  Can I see it?  Hot, right?  Look.  We're taking pictures from foundrymusic.com.  Pass it over here.  I can see that would have been one of the...  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me see the area.  That would have been the type I like, like a little pack of hot dogs. 
[01:18:00]  Wow, that would have been a nice...  It's 80 years old, Opie.  Enough time has passed by.  Look at how curly the little hair is.  Yeah.  It's so tussleable.  It's a little redhead.  Yeah, let me see.  I got to see this.  It's the cyclops, Anthony.  Look at the nose sticking straight out from the forehead.  Look at the little...  Right above one eye.  He still has a nicer chin than Norton.  That's amazing.  Wow, that is nice. 
[01:18:30]  That's freaky, dude.  I think we could all go home.  How old is that?  Who's beating this guy today?  Like, not 80 years old, but I mean, how old of a...  It's got to be nine months, right?  Yeah, it's a full term.  Full term.  Delivered dead.  Delivered dead with one eye.  Wow.  That is sick.  Look at his tootsies.  Let's see.  Look at his little tootsies.  All bent up.  Look at his fists all curled up.  Yeah.  Little feet all ready to kick and go...  Do you have stuff creep?  Fingernails.  Do you have stuff creepier than that at home? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  What?  You do.  You do.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  We've gone long here, but...  Can you get arrested if it's already dead before you do things?  Wow.  He hasn't yet.  Well, very impressive.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is great.  The Cyclops baby is...  Cyclops baby.  That could be the showstopper.  That is good.  We don't like getting the showstopper at 440, Anthony.  I know.  We'll see what happens, though.  We still have a couple hours of show left. 
[01:19:30]  What's up?  I just want to reach in there and rub the little head and...  Don't you want to tussle the hair?  It's curly.  It's...  It looks very soft, the hair.  That's a right off umbilical cord.  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  Watch your head, clumsy.  All right.  We're going to take a break, Ant.  All right.  As we check out all the stuff this guy brought by, we're taking pictures.  We'll put it up on the website.  It's unbelievable.  Make sure you get a lot of pictures of Cyclops baby.  That is very rare.  Get close-ups of the face.  Close-ups and all that crap, okay?  You want to put it in a stroller and just walk it around?  Wow.  Would that be fun to do? 
[01:20:00]  Could you get arrested for that or no?  No.  It's not illegal.  Well, it's an antique.  It's an old medical carnival antique.  I think it would be so funny to go to a mall with a little stroller, just lay the whole  vial down, the whole jar down in the stroller and walking around.  What he's got to do is something we've been wanting to do for a very long time.  Where's the nearest mall?  Oh, get the picture taken.  We want a picture of Cyclops baby and we want to put it on a shirt and says, Daddy's  Little Girl.  You don't have a little kiosk in the mall.  You get to take the digital picture. 
[01:20:30]  It is then put on a shirt and little things like Daddy's Little Girl are put on the shirt.  Imagine that.  You take it to the mall and go, okay, hook me up.  And then you talk to it.  Yes, you're the cutest little baby.  You're the cutest little baby.  Very cool.  All right.  I don't know if anyone can beat this guy, but you never know, Anthony.  You never know with this radio show.  It's 10-800 Main Street, Fairfax.  It's the WJFK Studios.  We're broadcasting live down here today.  And there's a nice party forming in the parking lot. 
[01:21:00]  And you can bring your stranger's stuff by to try to beat this guy, Cyclops baby.  Good luck.  Good luck.  The winner will receive a two-night, three-day trip for two to Hollywood to attend an  exclusive end-of-tour party with Poison at the Roxy Theater.  Trip is courtesy of VH1 Classic.  The new 24-hour music network.  And we're going to continue in a little bit here, Anthony.  Yep.  And in honor of Mother's Day, we got some of our Mother's Day stuff we dug out from the  archives.  Here's our pal Stephen Lynch with a little ditty.  So, you want to start with a little warm-up ditty, Stephen? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Actually, I'd like to play something kind of special because today is my mom's birthday.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  And this is only taking a second.  It's not a long song, but I know she's listening.  And I just wanted to quickly, I wrote a little song for her because I didn't give her a present  or anything.  I felt kind of bad for her.  So, let's hear this.  Thank you, dear lady, for being my mom.  You did all my homework.  You took me to prom.  And I was the only guy who got lucky that night. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, my God.  What?  I love you, Mom.  What?  What?  I thought we were all just having fun here.  What?  What's going on?  You want to touch it?  This isn't happening to me.  Go on.  Touch it.  I'm going to face down in a pillow.  Touch it.  With my little baseball cleats on.  Go on.  While the coaches touch it.  Teach me a lesson.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:22:30]  We're trying to get away from that brand of humor.  Crinkle, crinkle.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW.  Here comes the radio now.  Here comes the voice from the sound.  Here comes the radio now.  How you like me now, I say.  Here comes the radio now.  Here comes the voice from the sound.  Here comes the radio now.  How you like me now, I say. 
[01:23:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show, broadcasting live outside of D.C. at WJFK.  I just took a peek at the parking lot.  There's got to be a couple hundred people out there now.  Nice.  There we go.  We got a party going on in the parking lot.  We got a party going on in the studio.  Unbelievable.  We got Andrew that's showing us all sorts of crazy stuff.  Great stuff.  Man, we are so, you know what? 
[01:23:30]  You hit a nerve with us.  We are so into stuff like this.  And I think a lot of people are.  You notice that?  A lot of people have a twisted side of them.  You can grab that mic right there.  Angel face.  Angel face.  Like, I never, I really don't leave my studio at home.  I just stay and make all this stuff amongst my little, my pickled family.  But by chance, I just flipped on the radio one day and heard you guys.  And I heard Norton.  And it was just like, bing.  Yeah.  It was just like, it was great.  Oh, we love stuff like this. 
[01:24:00]  It seems the heck out of us.  Sick.  And it's great.  And it just inspires me to go sicker and sicker and sicker.  It's always nice as a comedian when you know that your material has inspired a man with  a dead baby with a nose in its forehead to come in.  The Cyclops baby.  The Cyclops baby.  One eye and a nose in the middle of its forehead.  Have you ever been to the Muter Museum?  What does that do?  That's one of my psycho snow globes.  It's the...  Oh, that's great.  It says on the front, greetings from Union South Carolina. 
[01:24:30]  You clumsy Jew.  Well, what are you doing, Voss?  You reckon...  What are you doing?  The guy just started panicking.  He's getting his little fingers into all the work.  I know.  We just stopped touching things.  Some of this stuff is worth like $100,000 and you're just rummaging through it.  It's not worth that much, is it?  Could be.  Some...  Well, whatever.  Priceless.  That's always good when a guy's got to walk through the parking lot.  And he's got $20,000 in cash in the box, too?  We have...  Thanks for taking a hint, guys. 
[01:25:00]  What is the snow globe?  Thanks for putting it over the top just in case people didn't understand what we were doing.  You're right.  I really did clarify that.  All right.  Go ahead.  Oh, I didn't know you were kidding.  I'm stupid.  All right.  Here's...  God almighty.  Why am I...  What does the globe do?  I just keep getting off on...  Oh.  Oof.  Now he's looking at girls.  Look at that nice back.  Oof.  She's getting pissed because she hasn't gotten on our show yet.  Bye.  Uh-oh.  The girl's gorgeous.  Go ahead.  There's gorgeous girls all over the place.  Home of Susan Smith, it says. 
[01:25:30]  And on the back, there's a picture of the two kids.  It says, wish you were being here.  And if you look down, it says, from the bottom of John D. Long Lake.  Oh, dude, that is the greatest thing I've ever seen.  There's little fish all over it.  And I have a little diver that, like, pops out on the bottom when you pick it up.  He's like, where are those kids?  And he's like, oh, my God, they're the kids.  Oh, Jesus.  He's got the little corpses that are underneath.  Oh, my God, there's little corpses and stuff on the bottom of the rig.  And this guy just makes this weird stuff when he's not collecting all the strange things.  Oh, my God.  That is something. 
[01:26:00]  Lay inside and make it.  All right, what else you got there, bro?  He says he's got more stuff he wants to show up.  Yeah.  This is a lock of hair of Charles Manson.  Get out, really?  Yeah.  And this is a piece of the floor where Sharon Tate was killed on.  Piece of the floor.  Oof.  How many copies of Chinatown do you have?  Three.  I got to ask, though, where'd you get the hair from?  It came from some of his associates.  Yeah.  Who are in touch with him. 
[01:26:30]  I have a bunch of Manson stuff.  That is an interesting little doll.  What if it's just a kook in prison cutting his own hair off and sending it to you?  I've talked to Charlie on the phone before.  Oh, really?  Charlie.  And what does he have to say?  He has to say, he pretty much does all the talking.  He called us, what, about like six years ago, he called the house.  Really?  Just called the house from prison?  Just called the house from prison.  I was up in the shower, and Tracy got the phone.  But Charles Manson's on the phone.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah?  He thought I said somebody else's name.  Wait, you got to talk into the mic so people can hear you. 
[01:27:00]  He thought I said somebody else's name.  I thought you said Richard Speck.  He said, Andy, get out of the shower.  Manson's on the phone.  And he said, tell him I'll call him back later.  I was like, no, you don't understand.  No, no, Charles Manson.  Charles Manson.  So I run out of the shower.  I'm sitting there in my studio surrounded by all my pickled stuff.  Fucked naked, dripping wet, talking to Charles Manson.  It was great.  It was great.  Jim gives a moat of pleasure.  What do you got there?  This is actually, this is from, uh...  A doll that was the prop they used for the sun tabloid. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  So I got a little fake Cyclops as well.  The sun, that was fake, that story?  Yeah, yeah.  Next thing you're going to say, there's no Bat Boy.  Bat Boy.  What was Boss clumsily fumbling with?  Almost broke it.  Yeah, it was a great collector's item.  We're taking pictures of all this stuff.  We're going to put it up on foundyourmusic.com.  For you, Jim, I was in touch with Linda Lovelace before she died.  And I was the last person to kind of, one of the last people to kind of take her under my wing.  And I took her to some of these shows that I do. 
[01:28:00]  And set her up as like a freak, basically.  But, you know, in a nice way.  Make some money off of it.  Make a little bit of money.  And she was a really sweet lady.  And she signed two of these for me.  And I'm giving you one.  This is an autograph.  Jeez.  Linda Lovelace version of a deep throat up there.  Dude.  Be careful.  Don't smear it.  Thank you.  And that's like a...  Wow.  You know what?  She really was against that.  How the hell did you talk her into signing that?  I'm a carny rat bastard, man.  Is that it?  Yeah. 
[01:28:30]  Have you ever smelled some weird things?  Smelled weird things, Boss?  That's great jelly.  Uh-oh.  Boss, get on my...  Dude, he's going to rub behind...  I'll tell you what he's doing.  He's going to rub behind his ear and it smells like grape jelly and it shouldn't.  Do you want to smell the behind his ear?  No, no.  Just try it.  Just come on.  It's like grape jelly and I don't know why.  It shouldn't.  Oh.  Ear cheese.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Thank you, man.  Very much.  The guy's going to leave, man.  He's our new friend.  The little finger is just rubbing.  A man with dead babies in his house found Boss's ear smell. 
[01:29:00]  Disgusting.  It's strangely arousing.  You're an awful man, Boss.  All right.  What else you got?  Probably the scariest thing I own.  I usually like to only handle it with rubber gloves.  This is a bag full of Ron Jeremy's body hair.  It was, I'm doing a doll of Ron, a licensed doll, and I called him up one day and said,  I got a great idea.  How about we have each doll come with your actual hair on it? 
[01:29:30]  And he thought it was great, so he shaved himself a little bit and sent me a bunch of  his hair.  The hedgehog himself.  Oh, that's hair of the hedgehog.  Where did he shave it from?  I think it came out mostly from the back of his neck and his hair.  Yeah, he is just a hairy mess.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Look.  He's the king.  Yeah, we've had him on the show a few times.  He's a great sport.  I can smell Boss's finger from here.  Yeah, stop, Boss.  I am so glad I have a cold.  That little, awful finger.  All right, you know, and on line two, it's Dave goes, One, do not give up on this contest 
[01:30:00]  yet.  DC people are psychos.  All right.  But it's going to be tough to beat Cyclops Baby.  Very.  A real baby born with one eye and a nose sticking out of the forehead.  Cute.  Cute as a button.  In a jar.  Went to term.  Yeah.  Delivered.  Part of a sideshow like 70, 80 years ago, so.  Is that it, bro?  I mean, not to say that.  Yeah, that's it.  That's great.  It stinks.  Yeah, Boss, get out of here.  We're going to put him in his own studio.  It's time.  Smelly Christ killer. 
[01:30:30]  Well, let's hear for Andrew.  Bravo.  Just for you guys, too.  I wouldn't do this for any other radio.  That's great.  Any other radio.  He doesn't even leave his house, this guy.  We're fascinated by it.  It's just like you guys are just inspirational.  You ever been to that Muter Museum down in Upton, Philly?  I haven't been there, but I know the curator of it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's some sick stuff there, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I've got like photos and.  We saw, the sickest thing I saw there was the cross section of the guy's  head where it had been cut from the nose back, like in slices. 
[01:31:00]  So one slice was just the guy's face.  And then the next slice you saw his sinuses and the brain starting and each slice,  a little piece of his ear.  Really sick.  And then they had one sliced the same way from the side.  Wow.  And then from top to bottom, all these deformed fetuses.  Very sick.  But so much fun to look at.  So much fun.  Yeah.  And great with Mother's Day coming up.  This is a wonderful little tie-in.  Yeah.  Hey, give out your website again.  Okay.  It's a www.satansideshow.com. 
[01:31:30]  Satansideshow.com.  And what will people find on that side?  Well, right now, because since I pretty much work and live and do everything alone,  except for Tracy here, she helps me out.  And I have...  Does your family still love you?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, cool.  Must be fine.  Well, they don't know the extent of my insanity.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I mean, I got a textbook case of OCD.  Oh, you do?  Textbook case.  So I just stay in my house.  That's right.  It's great.  We have safety things in place.  That F word can be removed. 
[01:32:00]  So your OCD is thinking stuff over and over again?  Always.  I always...  I got like three conversations going on in my house.  So that's my mom's problem.  Yeah.  I mean, I grew up...  I can relate to you.  Yeah.  I grew up in a...  My formative years in a mental hospital.  Wow.  This was like before OCD was like...  It was like trendy to have.  And they didn't know what the hell I had.  And I was like...  What were you doing at...  I was washing my hands.  They were like...  Just chipped and cracked.  And...  How often would you say you're washing your hands?  Oh, my God.  Hundreds of times. 
[01:32:30]  Which uncle?  Uncle Joe.  Which uncle?  That's what that clean hand is.  It's washing your problems with.  That's what that symbolizes.  Oh, yeah?  You do that, Jimmy?  And I repeat stuff and just all a bunch of crazy stuff.  I kind of got it sort of under control now.  Yeah.  But I just...  You still do little things?  Oh, yeah.  Counting and whatnot?  Yeah.  Just repeat stuff.  What's some of the things you do now?  Get the papers.  Get the papers.  You just...  Well, I repeat a lot of stuff.  You've done a good job today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Haven't repeated anything.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, repeat stuff like if I was to move something. 
[01:33:00]  Do you have horrible thoughts over and over again?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I got World War III going on up here.  But this is how I...  It's your outlet.  The care of it is that I make all these sick toys and hang out with a few select friends  of mine.  Wow.  And it's great.  I mean, this one article called me the next Andy Warhol.  And I'm just like...  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It was just like, wow.  I hope it wasn't the doctor after doing your blood.  Hey, you're an interesting guy. 
[01:33:30]  You should hang out, man.  We want to get more into what you're all about.  Yeah, you can hang.  Definitely.  I have tons of stuff.  So next time you guys are in town, I will make a special trip out.  He's coming to New York, right?  Yeah, I'll be in New York.  So you're going to be back on our show a week from today, I think?  A week from today, yeah.  So we'll have him back on in New York.  And he's going to bring other things by, Anthony.  Are you doing a show in New York that you could talk about?  Yeah.  I'm setting up my Satan Sideshow at the Roseland Ballroom.  It's a big...  Oh, yeah.  We know Roseland Ballroom.  Very well.  It's the yearly tattoo convention. 
[01:34:00]  Tattoo convention.  It's going to be huge.  That's next weekend in New York City?  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Highly recommend you go see this Andrew guy.  That's in the 50s, right?  Roseland in Manhattan.  52nd?  52nd, right.  I mean, I'll have all the dolls I make, all the Manson dolls, Dahmer dolls.  Some of the pillows?  Some of the pillows, tons of, like, T-shirts, just stuff that's just so foul, I really can't  sell it anywhere.  I can just picture that thrown on one of Jimmy's couches and his pad.  It will be.  Yeah.  Just move the big yam bag guy over.  I should rub onions on it to make it more realistic. 
[01:34:30]  All right, we're going to take another break and continue.  We got Stephanie, the winner of the Naughty Nighty contest.  She has arrived.  Oh, that's right.  DC.  We have at least six or seven porn chicks around.  What?  Where?  A limo just pulled up with porn chicks.  And they want to get on the show.  There are people crossing the street, joining the party in the parking lot.  We'll go outside again with Steve to see if anyone's going to even come close to beating  Andrew as far as winning this trip to Hollywood.  Would you go to Hollywood if you win this thing? 
[01:35:00]  It all depends if I'm not doing a show in between them.  Okay.  So you got a chance at a trip to Hollywood?  Boy, come on.  So in the meantime, Anthony, you know we like to do the fake orgasm thing.  Yeah, but.  No one's going to beat Lisa from the other day.  So we're going to do.  Hot.  We're just going to cut our losses and we're going to replay Lisa from the other day just  in case you missed it.  One of the hottest fake orgasms we've ever heard on our show.  Very good.  It was perfect.  And she comes from Virginia, I believe.  Yeah.  The other day.  So check this out.  A little replay and we'll be back. 
[01:35:30]  Right there.  A little lower.  Right there.  Don't like directions.  I like that.  No directions.  Oh, you're so big. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Pumpkins and Anthony show.  New York.  Dallas.  Chicago.  Philly.  Cleveland.  Columbus.  Sacramento.  San Francisco.  The Empire is spreading.  What?  Conquer Earth, you bastards! 
[01:37:00]  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show,  broadcasting live from WJFK on the outskirts of D.C.  We have a hell of a crowd outside the station, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, there they are.  Wow.  All right, D.C. Nice.  You know what?  Yeah.  Philly's going to be pissed off, but more people in D.C. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  But then again, it was a nasty day in Philly yesterday.  I was trying to listen to little things they're yelling.  We sent Steve from foundrymusic.com outside the building  because he loves doing this for us.  Yeah, this is thrilling.  Steve loves the people.  I am surrounded by sausage out here.  Yes, of course.  I saw a bunch of lovely-looking ladies out there, man.  I'm telling you, there are some very beautiful women  who I'm sure would love to wow this group of guys. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, we got...  Anybody?  Any takers?  We got Stephanie out there from...  Oh, there she is.  From the Naughty Nighty contest.  Oh, beautiful.  She ended up winning the whole damn thing.  Yeah.  I knew she would make her way down there.  She's right standing in between Rick and I right now.  Very hot.  There she goes.  Hey!  Wow, I wonder what that was, Opie.  Jeepers.  Oh, the crowd loves it.  That's a pretty cool bumper sticker. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, it must have been.  All right, Steve, anyone else out there with strange stuff  they want to bring into the studio or what?  What do you say?  Anybody got some weird stuff they'd like to show Opie and Anthony?  Yes!  Come on!  I take that as a resounding no.  They're screaming out things like they're mules.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, we got a trip to Hollywood to give away today.  And you've got to give it to Andrew so far,  the guy that brought in the Cyclops baby, Anthony.  Now, does that beat dead monkey hummer guy?  No.  No. 
[01:39:00]  It definitely is ahead for today.  But as far as the whole championship of this thing, no.  It does not beat...  What?  What are they chanting, Opie?  I can't really...  I really don't know what that means.  Whoa!  Interesting.  Huh.  There's a party going on out there.  Oh, my Lord.  But when you have a guy getting treats from a dead monkey,  eh, it's hard to top.  Yeah, sure is.  If some guy decided he was going to get a treat from the preserved elephant girl fetus, 
[01:39:30]  then that might win.  I'll pay what tops the dead monkey.  Someone bold enough to do it with a live monkey.  Oh?  It's going to happen one day.  Fight and scratch.  It's a big scene.  Steve hates this, by the way.  I know.  Oh, my Lord.  Oh, my Lord.  Oh, my Lord.  Wow.  I see nothing.  All right.  That's been going on for the last hour and a half or so outside the studio.  I guess Ben got cool.  You know what's cool about the listeners down here in D.C.?  Yeah.  They all bring their own coolers to the radio station. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  They're loud.  Oh, taking like a Tom from New Orleans point of view on things, just bring a cooler everywhere  to drink with?  Yeah, pretty much.  How you got done?  Goddamn.  That's loud.  That's a lot of good sports out there.  Great.  All right, Steve.  You have nothing, so we're going to move on.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thanks for helping us out, though.  Can I come back in now?  No.  You have to stay out there for the rest of the show.  Screw that.  All right.  There you go.  Steve from foundrymusic.com.  He's been working hard.  He got the pictures of the dead monkey Hummer guy. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  And all the pictures we took on yesterday's show up on foundrymusic.com.  There's a couple things going on in the paper, the papers today, Anthony.  Yeah.  A lot of great stories coming out of New York today.  That's what's great about being from New York City, Anthony.  Yeah.  You get to pick up the post in the daily news wherever you go.  I was amazed when I opened up the paper and saw one of the headlines.  This is a real headline in the New York Post today.  I, you know, we influence a lot, I think, our program. 
[01:41:00]  I really do.  And I'm sorry.  I think we influenced this headline.  It's page five, New York Post, talking about a slaying teenage terror in Brooklyn.  And here's the line.  Brooklyn kids slain in tussle, preyed on neighbors.  It seems the Brooklyn kid that was slain in some tussle was preying on his neighbors. 
[01:41:30]  It's right in print.  T-U-S-S-L-E.  But it doesn't make sense in that form, does it?  Someone was rubbing his head so hard, the little guy just died.  Brooklyn kids slain in tussle, preyed on neighbors.  What, should there be a gap in there, Opie, a delay?  No.  Brooklyn kids slain in tussle.  Well, I thought tussle was a cute little thing you do.  That's what I thought.  It shouldn't lead to murder if you're doing a cute little thing, right? 
[01:42:00]  What is a tussle?  I thought a tussle was just white.  What Jim Norton does.  Is it messing around?  Is there a couple definitions for the word tussle?  Tussle.  I'll confess.  It was just me in a Brooklyn kid costume.  Ha, ha, ha.  As the tumbleweeds blow across the stage of the spectrum.  Is Voss going to help us out with the show at all today?  No, he's doing nothing.  He's awful.  He's a horrid guy.  Or he's just attempting to pick up girls, right?  Horrid man.  That's all he's doing.  He's just working the girls.  How desperate is he? 
[01:42:30]  Because we all know how he loves mic time on this radio show.  He's giving that up to try to get laid today.  Oh, you want to hear his newest line?  Not girls.  Hey, girls, my tongue is your tongue.  Whatever you need.  Is that what he says?  Yeah.  He's horrible now.  He has the worst pickup lines ever.  Voss is turning into it like an old dope.  Will the both of you later be at the Watergate Hotel with a girl between you as you're spanking  it?  No, because Voss is staying in a cheaper hotel.  This is classic, too.  They don't want to put Voss up at one of the nice hotels.  Well, you know, the station takes care of things, which I appreciate very nicely. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  But old Jim Norton has to buy Voss a room.  Well, Jim Norton decides to put him up somewhere else.  You had to buy Voss a room.  By the way, Voss is the opening end.  Yeah.  He's opening.  I don't even like to think that way.  He's just doing the show with me.  But because...  Voss is opening.  Stop it.  In this situation, he's opening.  Here he comes.  You're opening up for Jim Norton today.  It's going to be fun.  We had a great time up in Buffalo.  Yeah.  And I was saying that...  I know you guys all consider each other equals, but today...  Oh, no, we don't.  Yeah, no. 
[01:43:30]  Today, he's opening up for you.  I'm going to go get some CDs out front.  No, you're selling your CDs.  No, you're not here.  I'll give a couple of hours.  Are you trying to clear that crowd out of there?  How many CDs have you sold so far?  I'm not going to sell...  At any event I've ever done with you guys, I've given free CDs out.  But you're going to sell them at the club tonight?  Well, at the club, that's different after the show, because Norton's only keeping me  to four minutes, you know.  That crowd is going to scatter.  You ever see, like, the Attica movie?  If Rockefeller had dropped Voss CDs out of the helicopter, the whole problem would be  all...  So you're going to go out there and show the crowd that Voss is indeed funny? 
[01:44:00]  I didn't say it was funny.  I was just going to give some CDs out.  Oh, okay.  And Voss, go outside and just ask if anyone wants to buy a CD.  I just want to see the reaction you're going to get out there.  I'm putting the mic back up.  But you want me to say bye or...  Yeah, bye.  Yeah, bye.  Does anyone...  They're still wowing.  Oh, yeah.  I got to tell you, DC came to the plate for the Opie and Anthony show today, by the 
[01:44:30]  way.  You know they don't want to buy that awful CD.  And Voss is trying to tell us how great he is at softball, Anthony.  Yeah.  Because we're doing the 2002 Celebrity Softball game.  Uh-huh.  And he's trying to get...  Hold on.  Oh, all right, wait.  Hold on.  Who wants to buy a CD?  Ten bucks.  All right, here.  We got one soul for a dollar. 
[01:45:00]  Hold on, Voss.  Voss, Voss.  Can the listeners hear us?  Yeah.  You guys can hear us, right?  I can't hear you.  Who wants to hear Voss' act right now?  No one cares.  No, hold on here.  No, hey, Voss.  Voss.  Hey, Rich.  Yum.  Oh.  Hey, Steve.  Who's got...  Who can hear us?  Hello?  Hello?  Hey, Voss.  What?  You got to do some of your act. 
[01:45:30]  What do you want to...  I can't do any of my act.  Who wants to hear Voss' act?  Yeah.  I just sold four CDs for four dollars.  No, Voss.  What?  From the stoop, you got to do some of your act right now.  Come on, do some of your act.  What do you want me to talk about?  Ask them if they want to hear your act.  Come on.  You guys want to hear any of my act?  Hold on.  The Def Jam?  I can't do the Def Jam.  There's no...  Oh, there's a black dude over there.  How you doing?  All right, here's his act.  What's happening, man?  I know the struggle. 
[01:46:00]  Hey, I know the struggle, man.  What's up?  My sisters go out with a black guy.  I said, what's up with that?  She said, once you go black, you never go back.  Yeah, that's because our family won't let you in.  Look at that, lay up there.  Look at that.  I'm killing on the stairs.  You stink.  I stink.  I'm killing on the stairs.  All right, keep going.  We'll shut up.  Go ahead, Voss.  I'm not going to do my act down here.  What do you think I am?  Come on, a couple more, Voss.  Do I?  Should I do my...  Caligula had a better time on the steps than he's having. 
[01:46:30]  Voss, you got to start your joke with, I confess.  Get to your A material, Voss.  They love me.  Get to your A material.  Come on.  Work your way out of this.  Should I do my Archie Bunker impression?  Voss, work your way out of this.  Go ahead.  Come on.  Work my way out of this.  Look at this guy with no teeth over there.  How you doing?  There's a corn on the cob eating contest here tonight.  You're a shoo-in for first place.  Smile.  Look at him slamming our audience. 
[01:47:00]  Look at this crowd.  There's three girls here.  Uh-huh.  I know.  There's some hot girls, though.  Look at this one right here.  What's your name, dear?  What's that?  You got...  Oh, look at that.  Your tongue is pierced.  I love that.  I got a magnetic penis.  Look at that.  I'm getting laughs on the stairs.  I think I'm going to close with that.  What?  I'm going to...  You didn't get a laugh here.  Hold on.  That's stuck.  Shut up.  Let me see.  Let me see him.  Whip him out. 
[01:47:30]  No, not your tongue.  Come on.  Come on.  It's horrible.  What's that?  No, come on.  Whip him out.  Whip him out.  They are so hostile to Voss, aren't they?  Just a hostile audience.  This is a good crowd.  Hey, Voss.  What's that?  You got to do your daughter line, please.  Hey, listen to me, folks.  Who has kids here?  Anybody have kids?  I do.  This is how pathetic my life is.  I owe my nine-year-old six dollars for Girl Scout cookies, and I'm dodging her. 
[01:48:00]  You're dodging her.  Hey, hold on.  Hold on.  Before I leave, does anybody want to buy a dryer door?  Hey, Anthony, we got some people that drove from Cleveland.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, some guy that drove from Cleveland.  Good to see you.  Now go home.  Anyhow.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's a girl up here.  Wait, this girl is hot.  Whip him out.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, they're solid.  Oh, come here for a second.  Come here.  Give Uncle Rich a kiss.  God.  Go ahead.  Whip him out.  Wow.  God.  What I could do with you in a room with a hammer.  What's that?  You brought bondage gear?  You hear that? 
[01:49:00]  Some guy in the audience said she's younger than my jokes.  This guy's funny.  He's getting bigger laughs than you.  Shut up, stupid.  He can say that about Barbara Bush.  All right.  Well, listen.  Wow.  I just told another joke.  Thank you, folks.  You've been a good crowd.  You did not.  Yeah.  Here's the money back.  Here's the money back.  Give it back to the people.  There's Voss killing on the stoop.  I'll see you.  Thank you.  You've been a good crowd.  Hey, Voss.  Good night, Voss. 
[01:49:30]  Voss sucks.  Voss sucks.  You're open through.  Voss sucks.  Voss sucks.  And the Voss sucks chant continues.  As we turn the volume down on the outside.  What a party going on out there.  Yeah.  What were we doing?  Trying to chase people away?  Were there too many people out there?  Is that why we sent Voss out?  That's called crowd control.  Crowd control.  Dispersal of a crowd.  All right.  Did you?  What was the problem?  Well, why isn't Robinson there with you tonight? 
[01:50:00]  No, no reason, actually.  He mixes it up with his friends.  I want to mix it up.  Get all my friends.  I thought perhaps you really wanted to look funny.  No, I wanted to do some with Voss, some with Keith.  Yeah.  I'm sure, man.  I mean, Voss was...  How did it go out there?  They weren't a bad crowd.  Yeah.  A pavement crowd.  The pavement.  They weren't bad.  I'm playing the pavement.  The stairs.  I went up to the top stair.  You did?  I gave the money back for the CDs.  I gave the...  Oh, really?  Yeah, I made five bucks, but I gave it back to the kids.  Five bucks for four CDs?  Well, you know what?  I raised the price. 
[01:50:30]  They're actually so much fun out there.  Bravo.  Good crowd.  I got a big crowd there.  They're going to be fun tonight, David.  All right.  Wherever we are.  Anthony, when we get back, we got to talk about Dan Quayle.  He says he admires Ozzy's family there.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because it shows like a solid family structure.  Right.  That he's always been behind.  What an idiot.  And we're trying to get some of the women in the studio?  What do they want to do?  What did you buy, Voss?  Wait, what did he buy?  No, what did you just put in your pocket? 
[01:51:00]  Oh.  Oh, my God.  What are you...  You're insane.  I'm planning ahead.  You sent someone to get condoms for you?  You never know what happens on a Norton show.  Yeah, you do.  There's a bunch of guys, you fag.  Are those ass ready?  Yeah, you should have got a chin strap so you wouldn't get stubble on your back again.  Why did that guy tell the truth and say you got Ron Jeremy's hair off your back?  Nothing on that one.  Nothing.  I'll delete nothing. 
[01:51:30]  You know, you guys all turn at once on me.  I confess.  I asked the guy, there was a gentleman from the station going to the store.  I asked him for a pink extra, so thank you for the bazooka and big red.  Chris on line three?  Yeah.  Amadou Diallo got a better reception.  In stairway than Voss right now.  Wow, that's good. 
[01:52:00]  I couldn't even read it.  It was so funny.  Damn.  All right.  Oh, man.  A Mother's Day, what, Sunday?  How many more of those can you come up with?  The guy at the end of the French Connection got a better reception on the stairway than  Tony Soprano Shrink got a better reception on the stairway.  Godfather 3, his daughter got a better reception. 
[01:52:30]  Very good.  Voss, before the show, you got to do it again.  What?  Go out and do it?  One more time.  One more time before the end of the show.  Yeah, before the end of the show.  Pick up some good stuff.  Yeah, think of like three jokes you think will kill.  Three killers.  Three killer.  Killer bits.  You got it, man.  It's so uncomfortable to listen to.  I love it.  Not uncomfortable doing.  He's like, settle down.  Settle down.  Martini had a better time on the steps.  Oh.  Yeah.  What do you call it?  Joan Crawford in, uh. 
[01:53:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  I've always done one.  Eat the parakeet.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Now he's explaining the first rule of comedy.  I know.  Eat a parakeet.  Why don't you eat a cockatoo?  Oh, that would have been a great one if I would have remembered the name.  I really, I, not only do I stink in New York and Jersey, I stink in D.C.  I'm a tri-state stinker.  Anthony, another high mom call as we go to break here.  For Mommy's Day.  Yeah, it's right around the corner.  We also, uh, dug up some of, uh, the clips of your mom singing, Anthony. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, Mother's Day, uh, Sunday.  Uh, of course I'm getting together with, uh, the family and mom and maybe a little song.  I hope so.  Yeah.  But these were from, uh, previous, uh, uh, parties I've had over at the, uh, family house.  We'll do it a little later.  Yeah.  But right now, you know, a little game we like to do where we have, you know, the kids call  their moms.  The kids.  And mess with them a little bit.  Sure.  This is called, uh, hi, mom.  I got fired from work today for self-pleasuring.  Right.  We used to be able to say the M word. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Other shows could say the M word.  I, I don't know why we can't anymore.  Yeah.  But here it is.  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play hi, mom.  I, uh, got fired from every time.  Yes, I do.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really go-able.  Dude, I'll tell you right now, if she buys this, we're going to give you a pair of tickets  to the Halloween cash bash.  Yes.  Hold on the line.  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Thanks.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah? 
[01:54:30]  Um, can you pick me up from work?  How come I can't hear you?  Can you pick me up from work?  Yeah.  Um, I got fired.  What?  I got fired from work today.  Can you pick me up?  No way.  Please, pick me up.  What the heck happened?  It's kind of embarrassing.  What are you going to tell me?  I was in the stock room, and someone, someone walked in on me when I was at 8 o'clock. 
[01:55:00]  What?  I got caught at 8 o'clock in the stock room.  They're going to have to pick me up.  They're going to give you a warning?  They're going to get in there.  What are you, nuts?  Just come pick me up, will you, Mom?  Chad, you're supposed to do stuff like that, the privacy of your own home.  I know, it's embarrassing, Mom.  I don't...  So where are you, at a pay phone or something?  No, I'm at work, and, you know, I'm here.  You know, everyone's been looking at me and laughing at me and stuff.  It's just...  Just come pick me up, will you, please?  All right, all right.  Want me to meet you out back? 
[01:55:30]  Huh?  Want me to meet you out back?  Yeah, just pick me up where you dropped me off this morning.  All right, you okay?  Well, besides my pride, you know, I'm embarrassed.  Just pick me up as soon as you get a chance.  All right.  Thanks.  All right, I'll be there.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God, dude.  What the hell's wrong with you?  How was that?  That was awesome, actually.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:56:00]  This has got to be a joke, people.  Hey, geeky, geeky.  Opie and Anthony show.  You alright?  What the hell?  How?  How is she not right?  Is she insane?  Will she know?  Is she insane?  Is she not right?  Is she insane?  She knows. 
[01:56:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show  Broadcasting live from WJFK studios  Outside of D.C.  In Fairfax, Anthony.  We're at 10-800.  That's one number. 
[01:57:00]  10-800 Main Street.  Fairfax.  Huge party going on outside the studio.  Oh, listen to that.  That's nice.  They just keep cheering and partying like crazy.  I mean, I want to thank the listeners of D.C.  for hospitality.  Oh, my God.  Look who's in the studio.  You're here in the former home of The Greaseman Show. 
[01:57:30]  You know, when I used to broadcast from these very facilities,  people loved The Greaseman.  What are you doing coming by?  Bone dry snarlings.  I'm looking to revive the career of me, The Greaseman.  You do radio down here on a little Korean station or something like that.  Waddle doodle.  Not fun having to sell your own advertising time, eh?  Waddle doodle.  Watch out.  Sergeant Fury will come in.  Sergeant Fury, eh?  I'll pick up some guns and start slinging lead. 
[01:58:00]  Take my appropriate place here for martini time.  A bone dry.  Let me get a little vermouth.  Bone dry snarlings.  Waddle doodle.  You see the crowd outside the station there in Greaseman?  Yes, I did.  They used to hang out there for me, The Greaseman.  They did, huh?  Yes, I had many fans, many fans, eh?  Listening to the antics of Grishmanelli.  Grishmanelli.  Law enforcement done right by Grishmanelli.  Here with the D.C. Police Department. 
[01:58:30]  You want me to play some sound effects for you?  Waddle doodle.  So you could do like a 40-minute joke?  One of my wacky bits that I used to do when I was here on the air.  Only Greaseman can take a joke that should take five seconds to say and turn it into a 40-minute joke.  Worse than Voss.  Waddle doodle.  Bone dry snarlings.  Voss was killing on the stoop earlier, Greaseman.  I don't see you going out there and giving him your aid material.  Are there black people out there? 
[01:59:00]  A few.  They still don't like me even though I apologize, dear.  I apologize, eh?  You did your best job apologizing to the black community.  They still aren't accepting of me, the Greishman.  Why not?  I go out and they still go, what did that mean?  No wonder they dragged them behind trucks.  I said it was a joke.  Oh, just me being the Greishman.  Where's my...  See, it's a goof.  A little gag.  Maybe we can share a bone dry and everything will be okay.  Listen to my adoring fans.  Hello, fans.  It's me, the Greishman. 
[01:59:30]  Hello.  Don't you love me, the Greishman?  Well, who brought you by for the Strangest Thing contest?  Who brought me by?  Yeah, we're doing this contest, Strangest Thing you can bring to the station today.  Oh, I get it.  I'm the Strangest Thing to bring by, the Greishman.  I'm just assuming someone brought you by here.  No, actually, I came by to beg for a job.  Can I do something?  Can I yell stinky rules on radio shows?  Please, stinky rules.  Stinky rules. 
[02:00:00]  More than a bone dry.  Snelling's.  All right, can you leave now?  Yes, you maggots.  Can you leave?  Maggots.  You're all maggots.  Can you get out of here now?  Hey, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothing back in place.  Steve, can you remove the Greishman from the studio, please?  Please don't.  I just want to...  You people...  Thank you, Greishman.  Bye-bye.  Wow, look at that.  As he's dragged out of the studio.  He sounds like he has a cold, the Greishman.  I feel bad for him.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:00:30]  He's probably a total ass who can't follow directions.  Hey, uh...  I must confess, dude.  We're going to have Vos go back out on the stoop in a little while.  Did you think of three jokes that'll kill?  I'll think of something real quick.  All right, well, this guy Brian from New York writes,  Vos has more trouble with stares than Christopher Reeves.  Ah!  That's the line.  Ah!  And Vos's sister wants to bang me, by the way.  Oh, see, yeah?  Is that true?  No.  His sister was emailing me.  Anthony, we got a special treat. 
[02:01:00]  We got to break in here.  Yeah, we actually have a celebrity calling us.  Stop it.  This only happens like once every two weeks, so we should stop the show.  It's Jim Ross from the WWE...  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  Hello?  Let's listen in.  Are they trying to get him now?  Hey, Jim.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  What's going on, bro?  Oh, not too much.  How are you?  Ah, good.  We're broadcasting live from D.C. today. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, really?  They got us all over the place this week.  You know, I guess we got to go right to the question everyone is asking today.  Why is it now called the WWE?  Well, the Worldwide Fund, Panda, took a dump on us.  Yeah, that's that World Wildlife Fund.  World Wildlife Fund.  Nice organization.  Nice group of tree huggers that do a good job.  Tree huggers.  And they just thought that we were confusing the marketplace, I assume.  And, you know, they have a unique way of thinking about things in our place, 
[02:02:00]  the state there in Switzerland, and they got a judge in the U.K. to agree with them.  That's kind of odd because any time I got some correspondence from them to send money,  I never thought I was sending it to you guys.  I'm sure most folks that had any modicum of intelligence or, you know,  had a couple of brain cells still functioning felt the same way.  But in any event, we got the F out.  Yeah.  Got the F out. 
[02:02:30]  That's what they're saying now.  Yeah, but how the hell did you guys lose that?  You know, I don't really know.  All I know is that we either had, we didn't spend enough for our attorneys in the U.K.  or the judge just didn't like what we do or maybe he was a card-carrying member of the World Wildlife Fund  or had a thing for pandas as a kid.  I don't know.  The little panda on the logo.  Yeah.  It's going to take some time to get used to saying WWE.  I wrote it on my head. 
[02:03:00]  I wrote it on my hands.  I wrote it on my paper.  I was, you know, King and I were doing that show live on Monday nights doing Raw,  and I was, I had it written everywhere that I could write something,  and I still screwed it up three times.  You screwed it up three times.  I'm an embarrassment.  I should have been drunk, but I wasn't.  Entertainment now.  Hey, Mr. Ross, you should know that Ant and I are huge fans of Jerry the King Lawler,  and we're so glad you guys are working together once again.  Well, I am too. 
[02:03:30]  You guys make a great team.  A great team.  We had him on the show crying to us about all the stuff that was going on in his life.  Oh, for God's sakes.  It was embarrassing.  He starts telling me that stuff, and I say,  well, you just go off somewhere and write a country song.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the way to solve that.  You know, just finalize the divorce.  You know, he's, he's, I think he's better off as he is, quite frankly,  unless she changes her attitude.  He's, he seems to be happy now, and he seems to be enjoying things,  but boy, he took a rough for a while there. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, he sure did.  He got screwed, man.  I mean, he was, he was sticking up for his, his wife.  Yeah.  The WWF at the time.  Now WWE wanted to fire his wife there, the kit.  The cat.  The cat, I'm sorry.  Remember her, sure.  And he decided if they were going to fire her, then he would leave, too.  And then he does the right thing, he's thinking, and then she blows him off.  Totally dumped him for somebody else.  And then you were put in a weird position now. 
[02:04:30]  How did you feel broadcasting without him?  Oh, I kind of probably feel like how it would be with Opie without Anthony or vice versa.  It just didn't work as well.  It doesn't work as well.  You know, there's a chemistry there.  You feel it.  But there's a lot of things that we do that we go into that we're just completely unsaid.  It's unspoken.  We just, we feel it.  We rarely prepare to the degree of saying, okay, King, now I'll say this, and then I'll  lob the softball.  You knock it out of the park. 
[02:05:00]  I'll do it on camera with an exasperated look on my face.  And you can heal puppies or something.  It just happens.  We just, we have a good chemistry, and it really works well.  And I'm really glad that he's back.  It makes my life a hell of a lot easier.  Yeah, and who is he pussy with these days?  Who has he fallen for?  Well, he's got a little girlfriend.  He's ridiculous.  He's got a little girlfriend, I think, that's kind of crazy about him that lives down in another  little southern Bale.  And I think she's from Mississippi or somewhere. 
[02:05:30]  I think she's a little old for him, though.  I think she's about 22 or 3.  Yeah, he likes him young.  Got to appreciate that in the man.  He picks this fruit young.  He's not a wrestler, right?  He's not introducing her to Vince or nothing to get into the WWE.  No, we've already had a long discussion that we're through the networking and using him  as the human resume to get somebody hired.  That's hard.  But I think, quite frankly, we were in, he may have done well last week. 
[02:06:00]  He seemed to take a shine from one of the flight attendants on the charter aircraft that  we were on.  Oh, really?  And I don't know how that all worked out, but someone said that he had that faraway look  in his eye.  So, you know, hey, the King deserves to be happy, too, you know?  Have you goofed on him about everything?  You go, what the hell were you thinking, King?  Oh, yeah.  Goddamn.  I said, King, God Almighty, what are you thinking of that woman and as far as the divorce?  And, you know, he's not going to, he's not, the divorce is not final. 
[02:06:30]  And bless his heart, you know, I think that as she, the cat said, look, I've seen the error  of my ways.  I'm going to repent.  Hallelujah, King.  I'm going to pray at your feet.  I think the King might just take her back.  And I think that would be a mistake.  That would be so bad if he did.  Oh, my God.  That would be awful.  Well, what a mistake.  He deserves to be happy.  And I don't know that she's going to be able to make him happy.  And he's a hell of a good guy.  A lot of talent.  He's unbelievable.  That was a great ass on her, though.  You got to admit there, right? 
[02:07:00]  Well, yeah, she was hot.  And she was young.  And, you know, he started seeing her, and she was probably about 15 or 16.  So, now I think I should go write a country song.  Just like the South.  Hey, Jim, I'm getting so much email and instant feedbacks coming in here.  Everyone is begging us to ask you, what the hell happened on that plane on the way back from England?  Well, what happened was we had a handful of guys that I wrote about this today in my web column. 
[02:07:30]  Which I appreciate.  Your column, the Ross Report, rocks.  Well, thank you.  I love reading that every week.  Did you guys have to change the website to WWE.com?  I think it's going to change to WWE.com.  I don't think it's changed yet, but I think it's going to.  Okay.  And maybe it has.  The thing about it is that we had a handful of guys on this charter.  I, you know, I'm in charge of talent, so I worked through the travel department.  I chartered a 757 to take everybody over in nice comfort and class and safety. 
[02:08:00]  And we used the charter in Germany and Scotland, UK, fly it back home.  And a seven-hour flight or so back, headwinds, blah, blah, blah.  There's about six or eight guys, maybe ten, maybe, that drank too much.  They acted like children, and they made asses of themselves.  Uh-oh.  And the flight was really, really long.  But when you read the Internet and you read about all the reports of those who are riding it, 
[02:08:30]  they weren't on the flight, by the way.  Yeah.  Essentially, it was a seven-hour nonstop party.  It's like John Belushi reincarnated his animal house.  It's just, you know, it's a hellacious issue.  And it wasn't that way.  It was a seven-hour flight.  And we had six or eight guys make asses of themselves.  They were called down on it, and they sat down and shut the hell up, and they mined their manners.  But we did have some issues on it.  And it was, you know, Michael Hayes gets his hair cut, his mullet's gone, and, you know, and all that kind of stuff. 
[02:09:00]  Wait, they cut his hair?  Yeah.  They pinned him down and shaved his face?  Well, no, he was passed out.  He didn't know it.  Oh, my God.  And he had that, you know, that mullet hair, that ponytail thing, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  So they just cut the end of the ponytail.  That's hilarious.  No big issue.  Yeah.  But, you know, then some guys are scuffling.  It's just a kind of got blown out of proportion.  But basically, bottom line, people had too much to drink. 
[02:09:30]  They didn't hold their liquor.  They raised too much hell.  And we won't have that happen again.  And because of that, Scott Hall got fired?  No, not because of that particular issue.  As a matter of fact, Scott Hall was very quiet and very docile on the flight back.  As a matter of fact, somewhat eerily docile on the flight back.  However, Scott's had issues with drug and alcohol abuse, and he felt like that getting back on the road was not, he was not ready for it. 
[02:10:00]  But after seeing his conduct on occasion, I would say amen.  And we mutually agreed that he would no longer be put in that environment.  And so we parted ways on Tuesday.  That's what I love about Ross.  He tells it like it is, man.  Yeah.  The other thing on this flight, Mr. Perfect fired for getting into a brawl with Brock Lesnar.  Brock Lesnar, unbelievable, by the way, Jim Ross, on charter flight.  And supposedly they were fighting, and someone almost flew out the emergency door. 
[02:10:30]  Well, that's a good story.  And what actually happened was it was basically the guy standing in the aisle with a wrestler's upright position,  kind of a collar and elbow tie-up test of strength to see who could make the other budge.  It wasn't a fight.  It was more like a schoolyard situation.  This is on an aircraft.  And I don't think anybody, I don't think the emergency exit door was ever made ajar or anything to that degree.  So it was kind of blown out of proportion as well. 
[02:11:00]  But we left Perfect.  We released him on Tuesday as well, not just for conduct on the airplane,  but we just didn't have anything for him creatively.  We thought we could bring him back at the Royal Rumble, and there would be some gas left in his tank.  And from a creative side, we just never found the right combination for him.  So he's no longer with us either.  What a great way to get rid of people.  You just take them up in a plane, get them all tanked, and then when they F up, you can fire them.  Yeah.  That's beautiful. 
[02:11:30]  And the thing about it is, I'm the guy in charge of talent.  Buck stops with me.  Hell yeah.  I've got to look myself in the mirror.  It's on my watch.  It's my situation.  And we had never had a problem on a charter prior to this.  We have put measures in place so that it will not happen again.  But it was an embarrassment, and I was embarrassed for some of the guys.  And, you know, it was just too much booze, high altitude.  Everybody was tired, end of a long day.  You know, but bottom line, it was wrong. 
[02:12:00]  Who else was on there that might have been tearing it up a little too much?  Goldust was too drunk.  You know, Bradshaw had a few drinks.  It seems like he could be loud.  Yeah, I would mess with Bradshaw.  Most of them are nice guys.  You know, most of them are not, you know, jerks.  But, you know, you get big guys, and that testosterone starts flowing,  and everybody's seeing who's the real, who's the biggest hoss on the plane. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  And it's just a bad deal.  Booze and flying just don't mix, really.  This is a classic, classic story coming out.  A couple other things really fast.  Goldberg just bought out of his AOL Time Warner contract, and he's now a free agent.  Is there any interest there still or not?  We have a lot of interest in Bill Goldberg.  And, you know, Billy's been hung up with those blithering idiots with AOL Time Warner. 
[02:13:00]  Warner's stock is plummeting worse than, you know, my first and second marriage did.  It's just embarrassing how quickly that sunk.  And it's just a matter of poor management.  And, you know, you go back and look at some of the financial deals that AOL Time Warner cut with their wrestlers,  and no wonder their company sold for literally nothing, and their stock has gone to hell.  It's just pathetic.  But we're very interested in Goldberg.  We hope to be meeting with him face-to-face soon.  I'm sure that Vince and myself will be sitting down with him, you know, hopefully in the next few weeks, 
[02:13:30]  as soon as Goldberg's schedule permits, and to just kind of gauge his interest in coming to work here.  We'd love to have him.  He would certainly fit in with our group.  You know, he could really be an impact player.  But you just kind of got to see how hard he wants to work and how badly he wants to get back in.  Right on.  And finally, Scott Steiner is now 100% healthy, huh? 
[02:14:00]  Well, you know, we've asked his attorney, as a matter of fact, we talked to his attorney yesterday  and asked him to forward us the last medical reports from Scott's drop foot syndrome.  And the key thing there is Scott's been wrestling some.  We've been wrestling a lot overseas.  Our issues are can we get him licensed in the States due to his physical issues?  If we can get him licensed in the States and him wrestling is not going to further his, you know, further his condition, 
[02:14:30]  then, you know, we've got a big interest in Scott Steiner.  But the health issues are still a little bit of a concern for us,  and we just need one more piece of information before I think we can follow through on that deal, too.  He's really a freak, that guy.  Oh, he's a freak in nature.  You know, he's a former amateur at Michigan, and I've known him since day one.  And, you know, he's an extraordinary athlete, but he's had a lot of injuries. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  And so that's the thing about it is, you know, you get a very charismatic guy with a lot of name identity that's a real hoss,  but you also get a guy that's right at 40 years of age, if he's not already 40,  and he's had a history of injuries the last four or five years.  And those things have just got to be taken into consideration.  I'm looking at a picture from King Lawler's website.  I guess it's his new chick, that little blonde.  Yeah.  Holy jeez, look at this.  And he gets his girlfriends to pose all sorts of crazy pictures up on his website.  Hey, he's the smoothest operator that there ever was. 
[02:15:30]  You know, him and Dick Clark are truly the world's oldest teenagers.  Honest to God, he's smoother than...  Jesus.  That's slick, my friends.  Right on.  And I've got to ask about Hulk Hogan.  How much longer?  Well, you know, that's a mother nature, I guess, probably the only one that can answer that question.  I didn't...  You think he's going to be able to keep the heat up for a while, or what?  I think for a while.  I mean, you guys gave him a big, huge push, obviously, and now I'm just wondering. 
[02:16:00]  I mean, Ant and I are not fans of the leg drop anymore.  Well, you know, it's like...  I told somebody the other day, it kind of reminds me, this Hogan phenomenon is a little  bit like one of my favorite groups as a young man, the Eagles, going back on tour.  I didn't get to see them the first time around, either I didn't have the money, or they weren't  in my area when I was young.  And so I kind of wanted to go see them this go-around, you know? 
[02:16:30]  I'm a big Eagles fan.  I think some of that's kind of applicable to Hulkamania.  It's a nostalgic feel, it's a feel-good thing.  How long will it feel good?  I don't know.  I hope that for us, and for him, the longer the better, but I'm just really not sure.  I think if we don't overexpose him, and make him an attraction, and not an everyday player,  he's certainly going to last longer than if we run him out there every Monday night and  Thursday night. 
[02:17:00]  There you go.  And now, what's the real reason you called us, now that we got all that out of the way?  I think we're talking about our cookbook, Can You Take the Heat?  It's now out in paperback.  Are you kidding?  It did so well on the hardcover.  I think it was three or four on the New York Times bestseller list for its category.  Self-help books, that Dr. Phil stuff, and cookbooks, and Emeril, and all that crap.  We did very well with that, and it's a hell of a little book, and now it's out in paperback. 
[02:17:30]  It's very slick.  Without being a gratuitous salesperson, if you're by your local bookstore, check it out.  If you like it, buy it.  If you don't like it, put it back on the shelf.  See you later.  Right on.  Easy deal.  There you go.  Well, thank you, Jim Ross.  Thank you, guys.  You've got to call us again.  We love talking wrestling from time to time.  Anytime.  I appreciate the opportunity, and you guys keep hanging in there and keep standing around on  the edge.  We're doing our best, my friend.  Okay, guys.  All right, thank you, Jim. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you, guys.  It's Jim Ross from the WWF.  Now call the WWE.  They have problems with that World Wildlife Foundation, and they beat their ass.  All right.  They got their ass kicked by a panda logo.  Yeah.  We have to take a break.  Rick, I've just been handed a note by Rick or Ben.  There's a shrunken head outside.  Real shrunken head.  Shrunken head.  And obviously looking for the strangest thing that you can bring to us.  Yeah.  WJFK.  And so far, the guy that brought the Cyclops baby is in the lead. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  Want to explain that really fast in case you're looking at it again?  Well, he had a baby.  It was a full-term baby.  It was born dead, I believe.  And it's in a jar, a huge jar of preservative floating around in there.  And it's got one eye in the middle of its face.  The nose, some nose-type object, it looks like a little elephant trunk, is growing from above the one eye.  And then it has no nose where the nose is supposed to be. 
[02:19:00]  And red hair.  Red hair, tussleable hair.  And the thing is like 70 or 80 years old, and it's perfectly preserved in a jar.  That's definitely in the lead.  Yes.  So we'll take a quick break.  We'll get the shrunken head guy in here.  Yeah.  I can only imagine what we could do with that.  What?  What?  These guys are just...  Thanks for helping us out with the show, guys.  We're helping out?  Someone just handed me this.  I'm so pissed.  I couldn't even drink today. 
[02:19:30]  It's all right.  You know I'm sick when I can't drink.  What?  What a great shirt.  Look at that shirt.  Rufy's getting ugly guys laid since 1979.  That's a great shirt.  Yeah, who brought all the cool shirts in?  Those two hot chicks that we didn't bring in the studio?  Yep.  All right.  We'll get them in to do a plug.  Also, Anthony, there's a porn...  There she is.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, with Voss.  All right.  They're running her in real fast, but we have to take a break.  Also, I just ran into a porn star.  Yeah.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yeah.  I ran into a porn star... 
[02:20:00]  I confess.  And I backed up and ran into her again.  And she's got a power drill, Anthony.  Four.  She's got a power drill.  Oh, cool.  I think that'll be today's show.  All right.  Hey, where's the really hot chick?  All right.  Tell her we'll talk to her next about the T-shirt.  Unless you can do it real fast.  Oh, my God.  Now...  Yeah, we'll do it next.  All right.  We're going to do it next.  So, we'll step aside here.  All right.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:30]  Because I'll say what the **** I want to say.  No one else can get away with the ****.  So, I'll get away with it.  Nobody in the **** world can get away with the ****.  So, I'll get away with it.  Wait a minute, Rick.  Now you're going to believe me.  You ill-mannered sack of crap.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Well, they are edgy.  The O-1-1-1-1-0-2-7.  The Opie W-N-E-W.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:21:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  We have about 40 minutes left in the show.  Then we're heading over to Jim Norton's show tonight with Rich Voss.  We're going to send Voss out on the stoop.  Give them one more shot at making the listeners laugh.  What do you mean one more shot?  They laughed last time.  They did?  Yes, they did.  Must have been an audio problem here on this end. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  So, we're going to do that.  We also have Natalie and the lollipop trick that she wants to perform.  What is this lollipop trick?  We have the shrunken head guy.  We have the drill dough.  No, is that what the drill is?  What are we waiting for?  We've got to get all this in now.  And they're still yelling and screaming and partying outside the station.  Oops, Ben, I just pushed this button over here by accident.  I don't know what that will do. 
[02:22:00]  Is it A or B?  I don't know.  It's five and it's blinking.  It doesn't look good.  Did I do something?  I like Kamikaze and Alabama Slammer guy.  Oh, yeah.  Some guy is handing out test tube shots.  I did one of each.  Works great with cold medicine.  I am feeling great.  God damn.  God bless drugs and alcohol.  Kids.  Yankee set.  All right.  You know what?  Oh, stop with that chant.  Stop with that. 
[02:22:30]  First of all, that's a Boston chant.  And it's only for losers.  What's that?  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  Yes, Jim Norton.  Stop it.  I'm just so horny.  Are you?  Are you, Jim?  Really good looking girls here.  Yeah.  What's so strange about today?  We haven't scared off the female audience yet.  Give us time.  Yeah, we're working.  No, you know what?  If you're a female and you listen to the show, please hang.  Hang in there and stick with us.  Hey, plus, we like the guys.  Linger longer.  If you're a female, linger longer.  Unless you're colored. 
[02:23:00]  What?  Hello?  Is this on Waddle Doodle?  All right, let's get the lollipop girl in here.  We got a lot of things to get to.  Steve is filming all of this for FoundryMusic.com.  Hey.  Hi, hi.  How are you?  Left.  Her friend left?  Wow.  Hi.  You brought the cool shirts, right?  Yes.  You're beautiful, huh?  Thank you.  Did you see how Rick guided her to the microphone?  It's not stupid.  It's like one of those dirty little league coaches teaching the kid how to bat.  That's not dirty.  Dude, you totally like we're guiding our coach to the mic. 
[02:23:30]  Exactly, because we have a problem.  With guests who don't really know how to use the mic.  I didn't see you guide the guy with the fetus in a jar that way.  I didn't want to touch that guy.  I didn't see Devin from Home Alone being guided that way like a hand puppet.  The weird thing is she was standing perfect.  Yeah.  Perfect to the microphone.  Exactly.  And it's like the studio isn't huge.  It's not like, let me guide you to the mic.  You walk in, you're in front of a mic.  Yeah, yeah.  You bump right in.  Good work, Rick.  Look, I'm just making sure.  Look at what he's saying, Rick.  Told you. 
[02:24:00]  He just wanted to touch her, which is acceptable.  All right.  At least be honest.  Yeah.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't either.  All right.  And your name's Natalie?  Natalia.  Natalia.  Natalia.  I'm sorry.  Natalia, Brian.  Natalia.  Natalia.  Natalia.  Well, that's not Natalia.  That sounds much hotter.  So you brought the t-shirts that we've been.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Now topless.  What are you, an Italian girl?  I'm Russian.  You're Russian?  Oh, slow down.  Wow.  Whoa, look at that.  Those are, those are beautiful. 
[02:24:30]  Lovely.  Let Steve get in there because we share everything with our listeners and this will be up on foundrymusic.com.  What an attractive figure.  Rick, do you have to take the picture that close?  Yeah.  Look at Steve.  Why don't you guide my mule onto her face?  He wants to get the nipples in.  Steve, could you just admit you're hammered, please?  Steve is so calm.  Steve's laughing, his tongue is hanging out and he's got the camcorder about an inch away.  Tongue is like blue.  That little teeny belly he has now, one sip of vodka and he's trashed.  Steve, stick your tongue out.  What?  Stick your tongue out. 
[02:25:00]  It is blue.  You went with the kamikazes.  Yeah.  Mine's red, I went with the Alabama's.  Stinky, what'd you go with?  Hey, I would love to talk about shots, but this girl's naked and she's going to do a lollipop trick.  And Voss is his wife, guess what he drank?  A sea shot.  All right.  Oh, look at that, okay.  So you brought the t-shirts.  Yes.  Did we read all the t-shirts on the air?  They're pretty cool.  And where could the listeners get them?  I think they can get them at t-shirts that suck.  I'm sorry.  I just brought them. 
[02:25:30]  All right, that's fine.  But I work for a touch too much entertainment and we do like bachelor parties and basically  like different things, different locations.  Are you from Russia?  Yeah.  You are?  Yeah.  How long have you been here in?  12 years.  12 years.  Yes.  Wow.  And you lived in D.C.?  No, I live in Virginia.  In Virginia.  Yeah.  And how did you get out of Russia?  Wasn't it a little tougher back then?  No, it was...  Well, not really.  No, not really.  12 years ago.  No, it wasn't that tough.  It started changing in the 80s, right? 
[02:26:00]  I think right when it opened up, your family left, when you were a little baby.  Said, screw this.  Let's get the F out of here.  A little babushka.  I don't know what I'm saying.  But you guys can go on touchtomuchdancers.com.  Yeah.  And pick the girls that you guys want.  Cool.  Glasnost.  Either touchtomuchdancers.com or ttmdancers.com.  She is so hot.  Yeah.  I know.  I can't stop staring at your boobs and she knows I'm looking at it.  I'm trying to look at her thing, but I feel guilty.  I grew it myself.  I know.  And they're natural.  They're beautiful.  Show Norton that lovely Russian ass.  I just want to look. 
[02:26:30]  I promise not to.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I was trying to do the gentleman.  You know, I was trying to look in her eyes and then sneak the peek, but she called me  every time.  You're not different than every other guy she's met.  I know.  I know.  Horrible.  I'll show her that I'm special.  Let's do the lollipop trick.  Lollipop.  Who's going to do the lollipop trick?  Oh, I don't know.  As Jim throws his headphones off.  Jim's already on the floor.  Yay.  Jimmy laying his head on the big elephantitis man pillow.  No, I can't do it.  All right.  All right.  This is called the lollipop trick, Anthony. 
[02:27:00]  And basically, Jim Norton is on his back.  Oh, look at this.  And Jim will have a lollipop in his mouth.  And she's going to retrieve it, let's just say.  Let me say something, Jim.  Before this, can I comment, Jim?  Is this perfect, what you're looking at?  This is the type you absolutely love?  Now I can see.  You betcha.  That's the type Jimmy loves.  Jim.  All right.  So this is the lollipop trick on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  And Steve is filming this.  Oh, boy. 
[02:27:30]  There she goes.  She's getting the lollipop right out of Jimmy's mouth.  What does matter?  Right out of Jimmy's mouth.  Look at where Jimmy's nose is.  Look, Ma.  No hands.  Jimmy.  Take a big whiff, Jimmy.  Aw.  Nice.  All righty.  Is it goodness?  Okay.  Is there goodness?  Goodness, Jimmy?  Yes.  Hey, she got it.  Now he's going to eat the lollipop.  Eat the lollipop.  Oh, she's eating it.  Aw.  Oh.  Wow.  The lollipop trick is great. 
[02:28:00]  We like the lollipop trick.  Thank God we've come together as two nations.  Right?  We got to bring her to New York to show New York the lollipop trick, Anthony.  Remember the old days of the Cold War?  We were so uninformed about each other that there was hatred through ignorance.  Now, just think if the lollipop trick was there back in 72, when they were really trying  to get that treaty together.  Wonderful how we brought nations together.  Kennedy and Khrushchev did that, and that's why the Cuban Missile Crisis was solved.  Do you think that's actually what happened? 
[02:28:30]  You picked a little lollipop missile out of Khrushchev's mouth.  Marilyn, squat down, Marilyn.  Yeah.  Teach your wives that trick, I think.  Really?  Yeah, that's a good trick.  I will not teach my wife that one.  No one's married in here.  I'm not married.  I was.  I teach my wife how to leave town so I could hire a girl to do that.  That's pretty good.  Here, whore, go to the airport.  There's a young one coming in.  You don't want your wife doing that.  It's just because your wife's got, you know, it's all straight.  Does it leave you a little sticky, does it?  Yeah, but we wipe ourselves. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, you do, do you?  Yeah, I do.  Ain't that nice.  A little info.  That's beautiful.  A little trivia.  You can hang in the studio because you're naked.  We like that.  There's a girl out there.  All right, all right.  Well, we've got to get to a couple other things real fast here.  Where's the shrunken head guy?  We've still got to give this trip away to Hollywood, Anthony.  Yes, we do.  Two days, three nights in Hollywood doing a thing with Poison.  Trip is courtesy of VH1 Classic, the new 24-hour music network.  Cyclops Baby in the lead.  Absolutely.  A lot of people, they've been thinking about this on the Instant Feedback. 
[02:29:30]  They're saying Cyclops Baby does not beat dead monkey Hummer guy.  But he doesn't have to.  This is not an overall contest.  True.  You win bragging rights if you beat monkey Hummer guy.  Oh, what happened?  Hey, hey.  Hey, what happened?  Oh, yeah, yes, yes, yes.  Sorry.  Da, da, da, da.  That's what I'm saying.  We're not in here to discuss the Cold War. 
[02:30:00]  Right.  Da.  All right.  She put her clothes on.  If she puts them on, then everyone goes, nyet, nyet, nyet.  I know that.  Nyet and da.  Shrunken head guy.  Has the listener seen that yet?  Not the trick, but that.  Not the shrunken head.  Yeah, they've seen the boobs.  Yeah.  Very good.  Went out there.  Okay.  Lovely.  You must have gotten a rousing applause out there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  That's what I am.  I'm an arousal technician.  An arousal technician, Opie. 
[02:30:30]  Coined a new term here.  All right.  This guy has a shopping bag.  Yeah.  You have a head in a shopping bag.  I've got a little surprise from my friends, the Opie and Anthony crew.  Shoot Jim first if it's a gun, okay?  Can I borrow that bag when you're done with it?  Crinkle, crinkle.  Crinkle, crinkle.  It's in a little wooden box that is shaped almost like a miniature casket.  Right.  Exactly.  I'll give you just a real quick synopsis and background on this.  My grandfather died back in December, and I'll attribute this entry in the contest to him. 
[02:31:00]  What does your grandfather have to do with this shrunken head?  He flew transport.  I'm going to speak on the mic here.  Yeah.  He flew transport flights during World War II in the Air Force, and he used to stop in South America, Africa, all over the place, and he'd pick up all kinds of crazy stuff.  Really?  And after he died back in December, my mom was sorting out all this stuff, and she found this, and she remembered it from when she was a kid when he brought it back from Ecuador. 
[02:31:30]  Ecuador.  So this is South America.  Right.  Exactly.  Interesting.  Here, Opie, if you want to read, I've highlighted some stuff on there.  It's just like a little detail on how they actually did it and proved that this is real.  And basically, they're...  Oh, wow.  Hey.  Yeah.  It's just highlighted.  This stuff is just real quick.  Here, Ann.  If you want to get into it.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Can we see it, Angel Eyes?  Yeah.  I just wanted to build it up a little bit, build up the suspense.  All right.  Shrunken heads are produced by the Shuar tribe? 
[02:32:00]  Yes.  Of the jungles of Ecuador.  The head's removed from the dead victim.  The skin then peeled off the skull, which is then thrown away, usually into a river.  The skull, I would gather.  Throw it into the Amazon.  It's like a donation.  Via a slit up the back of the head.  Yeah.  This incision then sewn back together.  The skin is boiled a little at a time until it is reduced in size.  Then the sack is filled with hot rocks and sand, molded by the warrior at the same time  to preserve the likeness of, I guess, the original head.  Eventually, it's decorated with some feathers, etc. 
[02:32:30]  It's used to imprison the dead person's avenging soul.  Celebrations follow, and the head eventually outlives its usefulness as a magical item  and is sold or kept as decoration.  How could it...  What magical item is it?  Like, what kind of magic could the shrunken head do?  Magical?  I don't know.  I guess it's up to your...  Because it says,  May cultural advancement disappear?  The head eventually outlives its usefulness as a magical item. 
[02:33:00]  I guess if the guy that shrunk the head doesn't have to worry about the person's avenging soul getting it,  it's outlived its usefulness.  Actually, during the process, they sprinkle charcoal on it while it's heating up.  Yeah.  And that gives it the dark complexion.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I thought because maybe it was a black guy.  No.  Well, I mean, they were pretty dark down in South America, as you can imagine,  but they're not black like as in African...  Right.  You know, like Mexican black.  Yeah.  And landscaper dark.  Right.  If a Mexican, like, breeded with, like, a black person... 
[02:33:30]  Right.  ...which you would get...  All right, Jimmy, the Greek.  But, uh...  It made the better athlete and the better shrunken head.  All right.  I'm going to pass this around...  Yeah.  ...so you can all check it out.  It's actually pretty cool.  He feels pretty confident.  Open her up.  I'm very confident.  Holy...  That is...  No way is that real.  It's real.  And I can show you.  You remember the stitching?  Yeah.  Let me see that.  Let's see.  Just hold it this way, sweet potato.  Florida?  Wow. 
[02:34:00]  Here, pass that to Anthony.  Jimmy Norton's thinking about bukkake-ing this thing.  Obviously, we're, uh...  Taking pictures for the websites.  Got to keep saying that.  And just...  Because I know we're doing a lot of visual things the last couple of days.  That head would go perfect with Voss's hands.  That does not look real.  Okay.  It is.  All right.  Take a look there, Uppy, when you're done examining the shrunken...  It's really old, too.  Wow.  Check that out, Ian.  I mean, of course they don't do that.  That...  It's well-preserved.  A lot of detail.  And the face.  Now, I'm thinking the hair is an aftermarket item. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  The hair is actually...  It's probably an animal product, but it's because when you, when you, um...  When they boil the head, all the hair comes out of it.  So all that stuff's just makeup that they do to, like, make it up afterwards.  Why are the ears sealed?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Interesting.  I'm looking...  Yeah, but pick it up and look on the inside.  No, no, no.  No, you can touch it.  It's not gonna...  Okay.  All right.  I shan't be touching this.  I'll show, like, uh...  I'll show Norton.  I'll pick it up for him so you can see.  Norton, tussle that hair. 
[02:35:00]  Would you please?  He's tussling the shrunken head's hair.  He tussled it!  Right in here.  Look at the back of the head.  You can see the stitching.  Wow.  It looks like some type of, uh, animal, uh, skin.  Yeah.  Huh.  Uh, well, you know, um...  My grandfather said it was real, and he got this back in World War II, so...  World War II.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, as, uh, as we pass around the shrunken head, we're running out of radio show, unfortunately. 
[02:35:30]  Uh, we're going back out to the stoop really fast.  Yes.  Hey, Rich Voss!  Is Rich Voss the stoop you're mentioning?  Yeah, Voss, uh, feeling a little more confident.  All the pokes out here.  He's going to, uh, he's going to try...  They love it.  He's going to try his aid material on the stoop.  All right.  All right.  He tried this earlier, and it didn't work too well.  We're going to...  We're giving him one more shot here.  All right.  You're not giving me a shot.  They love me the first time, right?  Thank you.  These are my people.  Shut up, Spike Lee.  There's a guy that looks like Spike Lee here. 
[02:36:00]  I figured that.  All right.  He said, shut up, Spike Lee.  Shut up.  He was the real Spike.  Is he out there, or it's just a guy?  Shut up, you skinny hump.  You look like a thermometer.  Look at the size of your teeth.  Look at you.  You can take a bite out of crime.  There's no crime.  You thermometer.  Shut up.  Oh, I guess I can't say that on the radio, can I?  Shut up, you stink.  Look at this skinny guy and a fat guy.  You guys should be on an island in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. 
[02:36:30]  We're going to have a rabbit.  All right.  I think it's we're going on a boat.  What's that?  They're giving me the finger.  That girl's giving me the finger over there.  The blonde right there.  What's that?  You're the only black guy here.  Shut up and be happy.  He's saving it for tonight.  Look, he's slapping me five now.  When did you get out, man?  When did you get out?  That's all right.  Listen, I got nothing against black people. 
[02:37:00]  I just bought some African furniture.  No, I just bought some African furniture.  Actually, I got four little black guys holding up a table at my house.  Look at that.  They're laughing.  I'm killing out here.  Any middle Easterns here?  They stink.  We're the Middle Easterns.  F-Afghanistan.  Let me tell you.  They are trying to fit in in New York.  You got to see them, man.  They're dyeing their hair blonde, taking baths. 
[02:37:30]  They stink.  You guys were a great crowd.  Good night.  Thank you.  I have to flee.  I can't sit here.  I can't sit here.  The bomb squad is making their way to the studio.  Wow.  All right, and when we get back, we're going to decide who wins the trip to Hollywood.  And we're going to bring in the girl with the power drill.  Yes.  As the show stops.  Nyet.  Nyet.  And thank you to the Russian girl.  Thank you.  The beautiful Russian girl. 
[02:38:00]  Touchtomuch.com.  Say that again.  Touchtomuch.com.  All right, and we'll continue.  Are you ready?  Opie and Anthony are going to touch you where it's dirty.  Take a look at Sam, okay?  The Opie and Anthony show.  1027 WNEW.  It's real fun.  It's real close.  It's real football.  It's New Jersey Gladiators Arena football.  Hi, this is Bob Papa, voice of the giant, 
[02:38:30]  inviting you and your family to experience the high-scoring, fast-paced, up-close action  of arena football with your very own New Jersey Gladiators.  For about what you'd pay for a trip to the movies,  bring the whole family to the Continental Airlines Arena for an evening of professional football  that starts with a pre-game tailgate party complete with a live band.  I don't know what the F is going on.  Someone screwed up bad, Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show in the outskirts of D.C.  We're wrapping up our little show from WGFK.

And whatever it can be used for.  It's wonderful.  It's wonderful.  I have front row seats.  You do.  You are actually being used as part of the platform.  I see a foot on Norton's leg. 
[02:40:00]  Norton, your hand, would you stop doing that with your thumb?  I'm just giving the old helmet rub.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Is that set on Righty Tidy or Lefty Lucy?  Which one is that set on?  It looks like Lefty Lucy.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, baby.

I used to use those tin nuts.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  He's upset.  Yeah, you really don't want to say that.  You want to say the device.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just leave it to the professionals.  There you go.  Because they will dump out and then you don't get your plug.  Did you guys hear what happened to us?  We were in the limo.  A&G limo.  Thank you.  Yes.  They brought us over here.

The feeling I got looking at the pickled punk was a lot more than I got from the shrunkin' head.  All right.  And we want to thank everyone down here at WJFK.  All our listeners hanging outside the studio.  Right.  Down and partying with us today.
