<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between segments and featuring highly offensive and sexually explicit language throughout.  The show began with Eric, Primetime Sam Roberts, and potentially other regular hosts discussing Sam's mistaken belief that he read about the "horned screamer" bird in *The New York Times*, revealing it actually originated from a restaurant placemat.  This led to humorous anecdotes.  A contentious voicemail from Danny's mother sparked a discussion about the hosts' strained relationships with their mothers, becoming highly vulgar and sexually explicit, particularly regarding Travis's estranged mother and her new husband.

Anthony Cumia then joined, expressing his intense dislike for children and detailing the frustrations of family gatherings dominated by his new nieces and nephews.  This segment continued the show's pattern of offensive and sexually charged humor.  A subsequent portion of the broadcast devolved into a sexually explicit and racially charged conversation between Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O'Neill, focusing on their preferences in women and their opinions on pornography. This segment included a rambling phone call with Andrew Dice Clay.  A mock radio show featuring "Dave" (David Freed) and "Bobo" followed, highlighting the hosts' ineptitude and the negative reactions of callers. The segment's poor quality led to a post-show review by Freed, Sam Roberts, and E-Rock, with Freed expressing significant dissatisfaction and blaming Bobo.  Freed's own aggressive and threatening responses to callers during the segment were also discussed.

Anthony later recounted childhood experiences of physical abuse from his stepfather, leading to a discussion on the impact of difficult childhoods on comedians.  A female caller, Dana, shared a shocking story about her mother's affair with her husband, prompting a highly vulgar and sexually charged conversation with the hosts.  The show then featured audio clips of a recurring comedic character, "Mr. McGregor," engaging in suggestive activities with young boys, eliciting crude jokes from the hosts.

A call-in segment with "Uncle Ted," a law enforcement officer, followed, discussing gun control and Ted Kennedy.  Comedian Jimmy then called, sharing a personal anecdote about a past sexual encounter his girlfriend found unpleasant yet resulted in multiple orgasms, prompting a discussion about his insecurities and anxieties.  Another segment focused on caller Jimmy's unsettling habit of creating negative fantasies about his relationship, frequently using racial slurs.  Other callers, Logan, Bruce, Charlie, and Lindsay, shared similar anxieties and intrusive thoughts, including violent fantasies and discussions of Stockholm Syndrome.  Jimmy later called Patrice for advice, revealing a suicide attempt and ongoing therapy.  The discussion included a segment about a man defacing a Hitler wax figure, and a call with a guest identified as "Mr. Spock," which quickly descended into homophobic and sexually explicit jokes. The show concluded with more vulgar commentary and banter.

[00:30:30]  but when you  when you do get a chance  please call me back  because i had this  conversation with danny  and i basically told him  the fuck off  and i just want to tell you  about it  because he's the cruelest  the cruelest  heartless  cold person  that i've ever  known in my life  i can't even believe  he came out of me  i really can't  bye  holy shit  dude  where's the tears  behind that laughter  where are the fucking tears 
[00:31:00]  behind that laughter  that is probably the worst  message you could hear  from your mom  that sounds like something  hold on  she could say  no let's just talk over  then it sounds like  it sounds like we were there  it reminds me of  it reminds me of a voicemail  i heard that  travis's mother left  it's like  oh my god  i have to deny  that he ever came out of me  sorry travis  i feel back in bed  oh and you should  i love  poor travis  such a little innocent boy 
[00:31:30]  that's why he's hiding  behind that beard  i know  what i noticed on that  little clip  the beard  what i noticed on that clip  is that your mom  sounds very like hot  courtney love hot  no she's not  she's got like a  courtney love hot  to her voice  no well she was  very emotional  because that was  she probably left that  message for my dad  maybe no more than  five minutes after  me and her just had  a huge blow up  on the phone  like it was just done  and i was like  what is a son  what is a son  and a mother  argue about  at this point 
[00:32:00]  in your life  well it had a lot  to do with  just the  cuntiness of the  divorce process  and just like  my dad had  he was going through  some rough times  he had a heart attack  you know had health  issues he lost his  gig so he was just  working like shitty  jobs and she was  still trying to fuck  him for every  fucking cent  that she could get  out of him  and she's doing way  better than he is  yeah  forever  and she's still at it  because she was  still at it  she was still at it  and i tried  you know and i  wasn't being  i wasn't being 
[00:32:30]  malicious i guess  when i brought it  up with her  but i was just  busting her balls  just kind of like  you know  kind of having fun  with it but it was  kind of like a half  not passive aggressive  but i was just kind of  you know toying with  her a little bit  because i felt like  i had the right to  because you know  she was trying to  fuck my dad so  oh yeah  she had no part of it  that makes sense  wow  oh  is there more to  that clip  yeah it's probably  nothing  message you could  hear from your mom  there's none  there's none tears  she could say  thank god he was 
[00:33:00]  adopted  you didn't know  thank god he was  adopted  there's none tears  god i'm so sorry  that abortion  didn't work out  he fucking dodged  the hanger  that's awful  that was the last  communique i've ever  had with your old  mom  that was it  that was a while  ago too  but she gave you  birth  she gave you life  that's all she did  though  that's all she did  anybody could take  cum in their pussy  anybody could do  that  travis could do  that  it doesn't mean 
[00:33:30]  that you're gonna  you know you're  gonna be a great  mom and it  doesn't mean that  i now i'm now  i'm legally bound  to love you because  yeah because you  took a load on my  dad's birthday  was it his birthday  oh yeah well his  let's see his  birthday  his birthday is  march 19th  my birthday is  december 27th  you do the math  yeah it was a  birthday fuck  so it was a  drunken fuck  yeah it had to  be  that's the only

[00:38:30]  through a brother  and a sister  I'm very nice  with kids  I go over  I play with them  they laugh  and then I leave  there will be no  babysitting  there'll be no  diaper changing  I don't  and here's another  thing  if they're listening  to the show  today  I don't eat  with children  I can't eat  with kids  I'm not crazy  children are  disgusting to eat  with  but they're not  like  you're not at a  restaurant with 
[00:39:00]  strange kids  this is like  family  this is family  they ruin the  food you're  trying to eat  and let me tell  you something  I got  you see a kid  slap his hand  into the big  plate of what  you want to eat  and then no  no no  and then I look  at it and go  well write that  off  I can't eat  that  with their slimy  little hands  they're always  down the back  of their pants  or up their  nose or something  get out of here  but it's going to  be your sister  Dawn's kid  don't care  it's different  no it isn't  it's no different  here's something else  I have 10  nephews and nieces  I think  maybe more  it's hard to 
[00:39:30]  keep track  and never had  to babysit  and never had  to change a diaper  oh good  you don't have to  do that stuff  you hold them  and every once in a while  they might spit up  on you a little bit  and then you hand  the kid back  you're like  don't do that either  and then they mop you  up a little bit  and you're on your way  don't hold kids  because of that reason  yeah you'll hold them  I don't like that  spit up thing  I'll hold it out  in front of me  what's this about  Jimmy  it's kind of like  I understand  kids in general  I do  I hate other  people's kids  but kids that  are related  to me 
[00:40:00]  you just feel  different  no  yes you should  no  they have  disgusting  wet little hands  that are constantly  being sneezed on  and drooled upon  and they're trying  to give you  their goopy  Cheerios  that they're always  eating  yeah  the little  high chair  with their  Cheerios on it  and their  sticky little hands  and they try  to give it to you  and it's like  oh take it  isn't that cute  ow 
[00:40:30]  do you know  my friend Eric  and this is true  he has three daughters  yeah  he came in one day  over at XM  he's a comedian  he said his daughter  was stuffed one time  and he actually  sucked the boogers  out of her nose  he's like she couldn't  breathe  if she was having  trouble breathing  you'll do  anything for your kid  you're so kidding  oh no I'm not  Jimmy you're so  kidding  I'm absolutely not  kidding  I don't care  if you're kidding  or not  in my mind  I have to accept  that you're kidding  because that image  will ruin me  ruin me  Anthony  yeah  what is it 
[00:41:00]  you have no excitement  that your sister  and brother  are going to have kids  I'm very excited  for them  I understand that  this doesn't have  anything to do  with them  yeah  with them  but  see  I can't  eat with children  but where does  this come from  I don't like  how goopy  everything is  it ruins  like the food  but they're going  to be part of  your family  they're going  to be running  around  they're going  to be excited  to see  Uncle Anthony  when they get  older  it'll be a blast  they'll love 
[00:41:30]  Uncle Anthony  you can teach  them a thing  or two  that their  parents aren't  willing to teach  them  you're going  to be the  cool uncle  and then  your brother  will look at  you and rolls  eyes like  I didn't want  to teach him  that  thanks  thanks Uncle  Anthony  that's when  they're older  that's your job  not at the  snot nose  age  where they  you know  wiping  every friggin  thing with  their hands  I don't like  it any more  than you do  greasy hands  but my nephew  I got very  attached to  you get very  attached  I didn't plan  on it  and I don't  like kids  either  Jimmy's nephew 
[00:42:00]  looks just  like him  too  he's a  miniature  version  of Jimmy  yeah  yeah  he's been  in here  a few  times  yeah  you get  very attached  oh yeah  cute little  tyke  because they're  family  you just give  them kisses  on the cheek  and you don't  have the  it's cool  to have a kid  without the  responsibility  because you  can just  play with  them  kiss them  on the face  yes  no they got  spit all over  their face  kids faces  are covered  in spit  they're gonna  want to hold  your hand  no no no  oh yeah  they're gonna  want to hold  Uncle Anthony's hand  you ever see a kid  walk around the house  with the hand  just down their pants  yeah  and they're walking 
[00:42:30]  around  why do I want  to touch that hand  it's not always  dirty  it is dirty  a baby hand  when a baby's  little fat fingers  grab your hand  it is really cute  you can't not  nature puts a thing  wash it first  babies smell good  like when they go to  the bathroom  they don't smell good  but when a baby  like a baby's natural  like baby powder smell  it's nature  so you want to hug it  and protect it  no  tell you  I don't  I don't know  the kid thing  would use a little  strange  I'm just dead set  against it  I enjoyed 
[00:43:00]  holding the hands  of my nephews  and nieces  and it's also  very depressing  when you realize  that the kid's  too old for that  he's going to  an islander game  17  and I reached out  to hold my nephew's  hand  and he goes  dude I'm 8 years old  what are you doing  oh  how sad  and actually  in his eyes too  because there was  a moment like  see I'm too old  for that  and I'm kind of  bummed too  to be honest with you  but you know  I'm growing up  we gotta like  think of new  cool things to do 
[00:43:30]  yeah  and then at the  islander games  and the islander score  I used to like  pick him up  kind of throw him  in the air a little bit  you know  and like  we're at the game  and I  the islander score  and I went to grab him  and he almost freaked out  I'm like oh yeah  oh crap  you're old now  I can't do that anymore  so now we just like  now we do the fist  we touch fists  oh you do that  these are little things  you can look forward to  with the little ones  running around your family  your uncle touchy feely  yeah really  ugh creep  pick him up 
[00:44:00]  I adore my  my  my  my  my  sister and brother's kids  that's nice  I like my nephew  I adore them  I can't wait to see them  you're  you don't have any excitement  I'm not  you're excited  you're excited for them  but there's  you're not  I  I'm not  we've got to find out  where that comes from  it  when you were a little kid  maybe it comes from  an awful childhood  that I don't want to have to  watch 
[00:44:30]  yeah  another kid go through  even though I know  they're not going to go through it  because I know  you know  my brother's great  and my sister's great  and  right  their significant others  are great  yep  but maybe that's it  maybe it's just my  my crappy little childhood  is keeping me from  appreciating  children  that's all  I think you'll get over that  I think you will  no I don't think I will  and kids are just  by the way  naturally disgusting  you might be the godfather  uh 
[00:45:00]  yeah  that's okay  well that comes with responsibilities  uh  does it  a little bit  I know  uh  I have two kids  I hate everyone else's kids  I don't like kids either  and I have two  see  everyone else hates your kids  let me tell you that too  oh yeah  we know that  yeah  everyone knows  it's the worst  it's the worst  it's the worst  how was your weekend Anthony  oh wonderful  yeah  just lovely  I had the uh  I had the old uh  go over mom and sales  aw  yesterday  because uh 
[00:45:30]  mom calls me up  and she goes uh  well  I haven't seen you in a while  why don't you come over  and uh  she goes  it's not going to be a big thing  you know  Joe and the baby  will be there  and Dawn  and the baby  and uh  she  and she kind of hinted  like you know  maybe you come over  just hang out  you know  no entourage  or anything  what you bring an entourage  over to mom's house  I don't bring an entourage  it's just  you know  occasionally some friends 
[00:46:00]  will pop by over there  and we'll hang out  and it's directly because  there's no one to talk to  over there anymore  right  it's just a whole other animal  so you need  so mom then tells me  look  we'll  me and you will talk  we'll hang out and talk  it'll be fine  it'll be nice  I'm like okay  so I go over there  and I'm running  you know  I'm running solo  so  it's just me  go over there  and uh  then the babies come over 
[00:46:30]  Dawn and Joe  and then  the babies come over  nice right  and my mother  was like  a heroin addict  she's trying so hard  to actually just talk to me  but every two seconds  she's like  oh look at that  you ever notice  how the little faces  they make it  I'm like  alright you know  go over there  no no no  I'm not talking with you  I'm hanging out with you  I'm doing  and then every two seconds  it's  it's the babies  the babies  and she's over with the babies  and Joe with the baby 
[00:47:00]  and my sister  the babies  the babies  the babies  and then everybody's like  oh what's the matter  you're not getting enough attention  like no it's not about the attention  it's about the  I want to be able to just hang out  and talk about adult things  not go go gaga stuff  all god damn day  you know what you should do  go over to mom  mom and Sal's  dressed as an adult  I'll put a diaper on  like an adult baby  the stupid bonnet  a rattle 
[00:47:30]  for some reason  adult babies have to dress like babies  from the 40's  they can't dress like modern babies  they need the old D style diapers  with the pins on the side  and a bonnet  and a rattle  yeah  and uh  yeah I'll do that  and maybe um  just crawl around mom's house  with some kind of  yeah  sucking device in your  in your mouth  and it's  it's  it's  it's  it's just that there's no  adult conversation going on  there's nothing  I sit with Sal  and talk to him 
[00:48:00]  but how much of an adult conversation  is that  he's  he's just as crazy  so I wind up going there  and it's like  okay  here's more baby talk  I love the little  effers  but I mean  Christ  did you pick them up?  no  did you kiss them?  I gave them little kisses  on their little baby heads  nice  did you change them at all?  no  I'm not even close  I don't even watch them get changed  that's not your job  your job is just to spoil them  my job is to just  yeah 
[00:48:30]  spoil them  I'm up to 10 or 11  nephews and nieces  there's not one diaper for me  my friends  but not even  not even like spoil them yet  like now they're at the  who cares phase  yeah  once they cook a little more  then they're okay to  like  when they start pushing a year  then you've got to get in there  and be the cool uncle  oh yeah  you know that  you know that  they're all counting on you  to be the cool uncle  right now  I don't care  if they make a sound  I had to listen  for a  dude  I'm being  I'm being modest here  when I say a half hour 
[00:49:00]  I'm being a little conservative  about how  Joe's  little baby  Layla  makes this  squeaky sound  and I'm  sitting there  going  yeah  yeah  and in my head  it's like  who the hell  gives a  what the hell  kind of noise  a baby makes  yeah it's a baby noise  and then my mother  has to tell me  and she makes this  little screamy noise  I'm like really  that sounds annoying 
[00:49:30]  and she goes  and my mother's like  no no it's not like  she's hurting  or in pain noise  or anything  I was like  that isn't what I meant  she could be the happiest  baby in the world  making a screaming noise  I cringe  at loud baby noises  and  and  and it's  all about  just baby  where's the conversation  about you know  ah  you know  drinking on the boat  or  you know  the good old days  or something  adult like  see those are  adult conversations 
[00:50:00]  talking about  what the children  are doing  you want to have  like fun  let's let's talk  about baseball  and farts  right  why not  that's what we were  talking about  a year ago  you just want to  talk about  drunk driving  right  speeding  and  speeding  and loose women  and drugs  how many years  I watched my brother  hauling his  amps in  the tar in one hand  the amp in the other  like alright  here's Joe  we're doing  and yesterday  I hear the door  open up  with a little bit 
[00:50:30]  of trouble  because there's  some clanging  going on  at the door  I turn  and there's my  brother who  for the past  I don't know  how many  god damn years  I see him  with a guitar  and an amp  in his hand  and he's got  a baby  and a playpen  rolly thing  I'm like  this just  blows  you make a  great point  it's just  the babies  the babies  I get it  the amount  of stuff  parents need  for their  kids  is just  amazing  it's just 
[00:51:00]  amazing  but what's  that all about  because when  we were growing  up  I'm convinced  there wasn't  that much  stuff  right  no  your mom  didn't drag  all that  crap around  baby seats  and baby  seats  we didn't  have baby  seats  growing up  they had  baby seats  I didn't  even have  a seedy  belt  when I  was in  the car  my father's  hand  would like  move around  and hold  you in  place  if you had  to stop  short  something like  that  that was  it 
[00:51:30]  yeah  some  drunk  ants  just holding  you  on the way  to grandma's  that was  your baby  seat  the playpen  didn't leave  the house  either  like that  thing was  made of  wood  it was like  weighed  800 pounds  he would set  up chairs  or something  and make  a little  corral  for the  kid  didn't bring  your own  playpen  now there's  8,000  things  he plops  her in  this little  thing  with toys  dangling  over  in mobile  fashion  and there's  things in  front  that go  grr  grr  chika chika  chika 
[00:52:00]  tock  tock  toot  toot  ring  ring  shut up  can't you  make these  things quiet  can't they  plug them  in and put  headphones  on the  toddler  so only  they can  hear the  noise  were you  hung over  when you  went to  mommy  it's not  like it  might have  been  all these  little noises  just bothering  you  it's a  sunday  of course  I was  you're stuck  with that  for a while  you should  have one  yourself  and then  it'll  fit in  please  just have  one yourself  just one  please  just let 
[00:52:30]  me be  sterile  I just  don't even  there's  nothing in  my  makeup  my  physical  makeup  my DNA  any  of that  that  ever  wants  me  to  have  a  kid  I  just  am  so  dead  set  against  having  one  of my  own  I'll  enjoy  other  people's  every so  often  but  I mean  when the  adults  are in  the room  how about  we have  an adult  conversation  that  that  isn't  just  about  the  goddamn  babies  babies  babies  babies  that  ain't 
[00:53:00]  happening  I  haven't  had  an  adult  conversation  with  my  brother  my  closest  brother  Scott  because  we're  closer  to  age  and  stuff  four  kids  we haven't  had an  adult  conversation  in well  over a decade  that's all  they talk  about  and it's  who's  carrying  them  and you  want  to  hold  them  no  I  don't  stop  asking  did  you get  a lot  of this  like you  almost had  eye  contact  with  Joe  or  Dawn  and  and  all  sudden  they're  like  and  you're  really  getting  into  something  like  yeah  look  man  I'm  thinking  of  going  into  the  program  I  really  I  had  uh-huh  uh-huh 
[00:53:30]  uh-huh  yeah  yeah  as they're  sort of  looking at  you  but  uh-huh  uh-huh  they gotta  look around  make sure  the kid's  not banging  its head  into anything  you gotta  hear every  little  thing  all my  mother can  do  these  days  is  look  how  little  the shoes  are  everything's  little  look at  the shirt  yeah  isn't that  adorable  oh  look  look  Anthony  he's  looking at  you  he's  looking  yeah  great  because  I'm  another  big  blob  in the  room  that's  all  he sees  he's  not  seeing  grandma  not  seeing  mommy  and dad

[00:59:00]  even sound right  men are not  racist against  pussy  like I'll fuck  a Chinese bitch  if she you know  wants to pull it out  yeah but that's  the thing with me  I'm the opposite  I have black  friends Asian friends  I don't see  differences in that  way but in  the way people are  but black women  I just I don't  get hurt  not attracted  don't get hurt  to black women  Asian women  like Asian women  from behind  are the sexiest  women on the  they just have  great asses  and the long hair  and they turn  around and my  dick just goes  down  I can't  Louis is a 
[00:59:30]  sissy  and I just  realized that  just now  I cannot  believe that  but every white  woman in the  world I'll  fuck her  but any  black women  I just don't  Asian women's  asses are  unbelievable  let me just  I'm just  how is that  possible  I like around  they're usually  a little  I've noticed  they're usually  a little  like flat  they look like  CD cases  number one  worst ass  you're thinking  like the occasional 
[01:00:00]  Lucy Lou ass  or something like  that  like that  like occasionally  you'll get  something  what the problem  Mars  oh  it was on  Mars basically  is saying what  everyone's thinking  Patrice doesn't  need two microphones  in front of us  so Mars had to  come in and turn  one of them off  thank you  I'm the same  way though  I'm racist  as far as  I don't know  why  but I've never  seen a black  woman  the only black  woman I find  attractive  is like  white looking  black women 
[01:00:30]  let me ask you  this  like a white  woman with a  tan  ghetto black  ghetto black  is where it's  at  is it  insecurity  thinking that  all black  women like  big giant  dicks  no  because I do  have kind  of a big  dick  you're packing  I don't believe  that at all  I have a nice  dick and a  pretty big  dick  really  I've been told  by enough  women that  I believe it  now  I've been told  by that but  it's not true  who was playing  you that day  unlucky louie then  what  oh shit  oh well you know  it was flaccid 
[01:01:00]  and it was afraid  of the camera  but when it's  hard it's nice  but it grows  into something  I can't help it  it's not something  I have a  eight year old  stunt dick  it's not something  I have any  control over  a nice shave  but I'm going to be  quite honest to you  I only like  mix something  I don't like a  full blooded  nothing anymore  right  I know what you  mean  full blooded  anybody  your girl  doesn't look  full black  my girls  have something  I'm attracted  to have something  exactly  have something  full Asian  does nothing 
[01:01:30]  full white  women  it's just  I enjoy a mixture  you need some  conglomerated  mongrel  I think it's  what you grow up  with  all my fantasies  were built  when I was 10  I'm still going  on those  age wise  blonde cheerleaders  and older  Jewish women  still the two  things I like  the most  who else  is racist  you said  you're racist  against  I am  but you can  figure that  yeah there's  certain  like I  don't like  probably  like Asian  I don't like  really  unless they're  mixed with 
[01:02:00]  something  they gotta be  kind of  Amerasian  I've met  black women  that I've  flirted with  and that I've  really gotten  like a crush  on  but then I  think about  fucking them  and my dick  won't get hard  and I can't  control that  what kind of  fucking Nazi  that's awful  I know  I'm sorry  like as far as  black chick goes  maybe Francine  I'm talking  pussy  yeah maybe  Francine  not dating  not loving  I'm talking about  pussy too  I'm talking about  pussy too  but she's crazy 
[01:02:30]  she's got to  cave her head in  with a hammer  when you're done  I'm ashamed  I'm ashamed  of my dick  I've jerked  you don't jerk  off to black porn  no  what  I've never  looked at  black porn  inadvertently  I've looked  inadvertently  I've looked  at black porn  and gone like  her father  must be  so fucking  upset  Jesus  you're talking  about  a white girl  with a black  eye  two hands  full  of mouth  and ass  we're not  talking about  black dick  we're talking  about black  pussy  you're missing

[01:12:30]  she's sucking on that cock  it's like sideways  in her mouth  her face is just  it's a horrified look  okay  terrific  imagine that  I would say  that's another way  that I'm  I mean if I'm  surfing porn  another racist  yeah another racist  thing about me  is to see a black cock  if I see  if I'm surfing porn  and there's a big black cock  to me it's like  stumbling on gay porn  I'm like oh well  just keep moving  just keep moving  but if you see a white cock  you think there might be  some chicks involved 
[01:13:00]  so it's okay to look at  I have no problem  watching a white guy  fucking black girl on porn  you motherfuckers are awful  just awful  what  then you at least know  her rent's gonna get paid  pussy should be the thing  pussy should be the thing  that crosses all boundaries  that bring us all together  bring us all together  I know  like I have a dream  there's no conversation  that a guy  guys should go  here's the conversation  it's like  my friend will go  hey look at this chick  and I go  ah her head's kinda big 
[01:13:30]  da da da  he goes would you fuck her  I go that has nothing to do  no  but that's what the conversation  should be  when it comes to pussy  like  oh yeah black girls  don't turn me on  but I'll fuck the shit out of them  that's more to do with  your sexual fucking obsession  I will fuck them  it's just that they're not  the thing that gets me  my dick hard right away  fair enough  I'll go with that  that's all  if there were no other  women left on the face  of the earth  and I needed to fucking come  there was no other women  by the way  they just needed something  a dumpster  just to dump a load in  I'd be happy  they're just above a cup  yeah  what kind of cup 
[01:14:00]  there are cups  fake china  there are cups that are nicer  there's some pretty cups out there  there's some cups out there  there's like black women  there's like some kind of cups  black women  other kind of cups  like that's the way the  certain kind of cups  you know I don't think  we've done  black women  I don't think we've done  much today  to bring the races together  no  I don't think my birthday  is really bringing  the races together  usually me and Patrice  will have discussions 
[01:14:30]  and I think at the end  of the day  it kind of helps  bring us  give us a more mutual  understanding of each other  I think we've gone  a couple of steps back  today  well the pussy thing  bothers me  that really bothers you  because that is just something  don't you understand  it has more to do  with your sexual obsession  than it does us  not liking  certain types of women  you'll fuck anything  that doesn't  you transcend race  because you'll fuck anything  well I'll fuck anything  most guys will fuck anything  I'll fuck anything too  that's absolutely true  under certain circumstances  he will at the drop of a hat  when you say anything 
[01:15:00]  that's why he bought a hat  so he could drop it  and fuck something  fuck people  not anything  is the problem  like some guys  might not fuck  a certain level  like they won't go  into a nine  or some shit  but we're talking  we're not talking  like ugly  and this and that  we're talking  racially  you have problems  getting horny  with a black 10  I found those black  skinny chicks  attractive  definitely  listen to how you're saying it  brown and round  were not black 10s 
[01:15:30]  those are not black 10s  no I won't be tentative then  those are black 10s  I'll say they were hot  see everybody's got  a different scale  those are black 10s  black 10s  those fucking fat ass ones  and the black community  oh my god  they are coveted  just like white guys  covet tall  skinny  white women  I don't  they do nothing for me  I will fuck one  because they exist  okay but so that's  exactly the same then  that's exactly the same  the only thing you won't  fuck them is like  a yeti  so you're admitting  to the same prejudice 
[01:16:00]  as us then  that you will  that the women  that you  that you think  white people hold  in the highest esteem  the tall  you just said  they don't do  anything for you  but you'll fuck some  but listen  if I go  look skinny white bitches  especially ones like  that have the bone  in the pelvis  like you can see  the pelvic bone  yeah  that bothers me  but you go  she has a pussy  and she  you know she looks good  to something else  yeah  or someone else  it's like hey  you know white guys

[01:23:00]  more today than other days  what happened  we just talked about for an hour  it's snatched  whatever  but what happened  we were in the middle of a bit  and they pulled the plug  how's that  who pulled the plug  management  well that's what goes on  they pulled the plug  next thing you know  you're in your car  listening to Van Halen  oh they pulled the plug  on the show  oh yeah  but why  what'd you do  that was so bad  did you use  unfathomable language  no  we're not that stupid  was it unsurly 
[01:23:30]  was it what  unsurly  like wrong  unsurly  you know what I mean  you're unsurly dice  no I'm not unsurly  shut your mouth  I'm trying to get to the point  I like my steak unsurly  let me tell you something Anthony  yeah  let me tell you something  if I was me right  right  which I am  yeah  because you're you  right  then you would say that  you know what I mean  other than that  you don't repeat anything  like that  what did he just say  what  I don't even understand 
[01:24:00]  what you just said  no listen  if you were you  who you are  you know it's funny  when I talk stupid  you understand me better  when I'm trying to explain  something the right way  you don't understand  what I just say  if you were you  which you are  and I'm me  which I  which  which  which you're you  which makes me me  right  it would be like  an unsurly thing to say  you are  out of your mind  no I'm not out of my mind  I happen to be 
[01:24:30]  a very smart individual  oh yeah  that's right  you're a little unsurly  today though  no you're unsurly  you're the one  that got the plug pulled  yes we did  and now we're a little  unsurly  I just gotta tell him  I can max  shut that door  get out of here  get out of here  thanks  I had a  big fight  with my freaking wife  so  about what  so I punched  my kid in the face  because  I was taught 
[01:25:00]  very early in life  you never heard  hurt a woman  and I told her  don't make me mad  don't make me  you know  and he's always  gotta stand there  and listen  and I told him  get out of the room  you don't wanna be here  for this  you know what I mean  because I'm a gentleman  you don't hit a woman  and then you just  gotta punch  so you punch the kid  so anyway  why'd you get  the plug pulled  I know right now  people are in their cars  going  I hate him  he hits his children  that's how dumb  now was that real  you don't have to 
[01:25:30]  explain yourself  let people think  do you remember  what I just said  yeah you hit your kid  hard  yeah in the face  in the face  we saw it backstage  at the garden  before you went on  you slap your children  around  I have the only kids  in the world  that go  if we behave today dad  in a happy tone  they say this  when you take us home  can we have a vicious beating  yeah  see that's a good  thought pattern  so anyway  what was the bit about  oh we can't go into it  where's Jay Moore  Jay Moore

[01:47:30]  get a fucking subject  and then fucking  talk about it  you don't know how to  carry on a conversation  this is Bobo  we're talking  this is Bobo  we're talking about here  this is Bobo  we're talking  you're a fucking retard  you don't fucking  hey Bobo  what do you think about  Bobo  what do you think about  the microphone  for your face  Bobo  what do you think  about breathing  Bobo  what do you think  about fucking shitting  this is Bobo  we're talking with here  pick a topic  and fucking talk  to the guy about it  you think so  you're a fucking retard  why don't you host  a show with Bobo 
[01:48:00]  alright  and then you see  what you can talk  about with him  alright  alright  yeah I thought so  you hung up huh  that's right  that's what I thought man  great good for you  I don't know  these callers are being  these callers are being  really ridiculous  Bobo what do you think  about these callers huh  they're being pretty ridiculous  they're being pretty ridiculous  alright but I have to admit  though that does make  interesting radio  hearing these guys  alright so okay  okay fine so you want to  talk about a topic  do you have any topics  you're interested in Bobo 
[01:48:30]  how about Rihanna  Rihanna's on the front page  of the cover of the  New York Post  you heard about this  whole story though  Rihanna and Chris Brown  yeah I heard about it  alright I heard about it  alright I haven't seen  any of the photos of  yet but I could imagine  yeah I looked at the  newspaper she's right on  the right on top of course  this guy Chris Brown  brutally they were dating  you know who they are  first of all you know  who they are right Bobo  of course I know who they  are they're big R&B star  R&B rap pop stars 
[01:49:00]  they're big stars big  big singers and they're  dating and Rihanna is  getting brutally beaten  up by Chris Brown  she's taking it from  look at all this  I mean you've seen  all the scars and bruises  on the face of Rihanna  what do you think  about all this  I think this is terrible  this is the wrong way  to go  how are they going  to get far in life  or have like a  relation  this is bad for the  music industry  I personally think  what do you think  about all this  yeah it is  to me it amazes me  they're still dating  she must really like  an ass kicking  if she's still going  with him  you think so  yeah Bobo 
[01:49:30]  if I may ask  before that  you know Mike  the guy that just  called before  what do you think  about this guy Mike  that just called  before  if I may ask  real quick  I'm sorry to interject  about the Rihanna story  but real quick  I think a lot of people  are just getting used to this  because this is just  a new thing  that they're just  hearing this  after all  this is the first show  right  this is the debut  so of course  right so  but did you think  he was like  a real asshole  and he like  you think he was  like a real asshole  I think that guy  was a personal asshole  like he's ruining  our show  and making fun  of our show 
[01:50:00]  like this  that fucking idiot  asshole  was ruining our show  and saying rude things  telling us how to  run our show  this is the Dave  and Bobo show  come on  come on Bobo  you gotta have  some stuff about it  like what do you  want to do  like if Mike  pretend Mike  was in the studio  right now  what would you  want to do  to him right now  he was rude  and made fun  of your show  and was trying  to tell you  what to do  what would you  want to do  to him right now  for what he said  to you on the show  what would you  want to do  to him Bobo  I'd say  Ramon  somebody  somebody  get  that's what 
[01:50:30]  you would do  you wouldn't  you take a fist  and knock  into his head  and beat him  up and  fucking punch  him out  and beat  the shit  out of that  guy  for all  of what  he said  to you  heck yeah  I'd probably  go  I'd probably  knock the guy  out after  you knocked  the guy  out  but what  was that  before  what was  that noise  you were  making before  come on  you wouldn't  just like  go there  and make  noises  you'd  fucking  punch  him  in the  mouth  you'd  beat  him  up  you'd  knock  him  down  you'd  bust  him  out  you'd  send him  to the  hospital  you'd  want to  kill  that  guy  wouldn't  you  he was rude  on your debut  of the show  you had a rude  caller like that  that's pretty rude  man  if I admit that 
[01:51:00]  I'd want him to look  like a UFC victim  a UFC victim  there you go man  you'd kick him in the  cunt  wouldn't you Bobo  I know I would kick  that guy in the  cunt  I think I'd go  one step further  I think I'd bring out  the old  flamethrower  the old flamethrower  yeah I'd fuck that guy  in his mouth  wouldn't you  I don't know about that  but  you want to do that Bobo  I think  I think I'd probably  bring out the  the  the whole rocket launcher  on the guy  that's what you do  yeah I'd bring out 
[01:51:30]  the rocket launcher  alright  these callers are  getting pretty  pretty brutal  with us for the  first entire show  that's over  that guy would be  pretty brutal  for the first entire show  you know Bobo  yep I know what you mean  looks like we got  we got the  the Mary Brothers music  we gotta finish  gotta finish up  yeah we definitely  do gotta finish up  well Bobo  it was a good first show  I enjoyed it  so once again  this has been the  Dave and Bobo show  have a good weekend  everybody goodbye guys  Bobo  Bobo say goodbye  to the callers  alright  bye callers 
[01:52:00]  it's the David and Bobo show  I think a lot of people  are just getting used to this  because this is just  a new thing  that they're just hearing  it's the David and Bobo show  Bobo show  hey it's the worst  of Opie and Anthony  and you just heard  the David and Bobo show  and we are here  with intern David  yes we are lucky enough  this of course  is Sam and E-Rock  from Opie and Anthony  and intern David  you got to host  your very own radio show  yes I certainly did  that's correct  how do you think 
[01:52:30]  it went David  I don't think  it went too good  honestly  why is that  um  we got a lot of calls  the phones were  ringing  the phones were  lighting up  and stuff  and the callers  weren't very happy  with what was going on  in the show  they were disagreeing  and saying it was  horrible  I should talk about  news topics  instead of  you know  just interviewing Bobo  no yeah  we just heard it  along with all the  other people listening  after re-listening to it  do you think  there's some improvements  you could have made  uh  it depends though  I mean  part of the  I think  to me  I don't mean to be rude 
[01:53:00]  or anything  but part of the reason  why I think  it went so poorly  because of my co-host  Bobo  you'd say  would be the problem  I would say so  I felt uncomfortable  with doing like  a real show  like talking about  news topics  or talking about  like what was on  the front cover  of the story  like the Rihanna  Chris Brown story  I felt uncomfortable  talking about it  with him  did you feel like  you were carrying  the show  I feel like I was  carrying the show  a little bit  but I was also  uncomfortable  because it was  off the cuff  I didn't know  I was going to do this  is it fair to say  that you didn't even 
[01:53:30]  really give Bobo  a lot of time to speak  you kind of  monopolize  that whole conversation  I'd have to agree  that it did kind of  monopolize the conversation  and why did you do that  I did that  because I felt  that Bobo  is not really  very good  meant for radio  or not very good  to talk to  on the radio  I felt like  I wasn't able  to give him a chance  I understand  why ONA  wants him to do it  because I am  who I am  and Bobo  has certain disabilities  that make him  turn out weird  to other people  so I understand  why they wanted him 
[01:54:00]  on the air  but the bottom line  is he's not  David Freed  he is not  David Freed  but if it was  any other normal  if it was any other  normal human being  like any other fan  I think I probably  could have had  a normal conversation  with him  and talked about  any news topic  or anything  well that's the thing  people are failing  to realize  that you're sitting  here  a professionally  trained broadcaster  you've had this  internship  you've had training  I wouldn't say  I'm a professional  broadcaster  you're a professionally  trained broadcaster  professionally trained  if you want to say that  sure  I mean CSB  isn't just for clowns 
[01:54:30]  and jokers  tell that to some people  Artie Lang right  he's a joker  he's a comedian  I'm just kidding  David  Artie Lang went to CSB  he did  yes  but now you are forced  to do a show  with someone  who's just off the street  as a professionally  trained broadcaster  do you think  that you held up  your end  I don't know  I have to agree  I might not have held  up my end  but I think  I did that  I think  that was on purpose  could have been on purpose  you threw in the towel  on purpose 
[01:55:00]  you threw it  well I didn't throw it  no I definitely  didn't throw it  when I found out  that I was going to do  this segment with Bobo  or this Dave and Bobo show  I went with  in my mind  well this guy  is who he is  he has issues  disabilities  and I pretty much  was going to be like  I wanted to get to know  this person  find out why he has  the name he has  what he's all about  but what really came out  in the show  was your ability  to act as an insult  comic  the way you just  came at  all the callers  and just boom boom  got them back  got them back 
[01:55:30]  where does the quick  wit come from  the quick wit comes  from me being annoyed  and pissed off  at the fact that  these callers are  rooting my show  and saying negative  things  I don't like to  take negativity  from callers  and stuff  when I hear negativity  I'm going to go back  and be negative to them  you threatened  to fuck one  caller in the mouth  I did threaten  to do that  I threatened him  because he was  rude to me  and rooting my show  I'm going to be  rude back to the caller  caller's rude to me  I'll be rude back  to the caller  that's what I'm  talking about  David as we wrap up  here give us your  final thoughts  your overall impression  of the entire show 
[01:56:00]  my overall final thoughts  of the show  was that shit storm  it was a shit storm  it didn't go as well  as I had planned it to go  I went pretty bad  I'd have to say  would you ever do this again  um  I don't think I'd ever do  a David and Bobo show  ever again  no  would you just do  the David Freed show  I would do  the David Freed show  the only  the only way  I'd ever do  the David and Bobo show  again is if  Opie, Anthony  or Jim Norton  told me to do  the David and Bobo show  again  if they told me to  then of course  I'd have to listen  to them and do it  and finally  in closing  how shitty  is your life  my life is very 
[01:56:30]  very shitty  alright cool  thanks a lot  David  David how can  the listeners  reach out to you  where do they  find you at  the listeners  can reach out to me  by going to my  Facebook page  and they can  look up David Freed  D-A-V-I-D-F-R-I-E-D  and look it up  on Facebook  and request me  as a friend  if they so choose  ok well there it is  intern David  wrapping up  the David and Bobo show  here on the worst  of Opie and Anthony  hey Anthony  yes sir  you gotta go  to an NHRA  national event  and see some  really fast cars 
[01:57:00]  I've been to  English Town  my friend  I have seen  Top Fuel  Dragsters  and Funny Cars  and yeah  it's amazing  that  that  that  bam  bam  bam  bam  sound  and your fucking  ears can't even  take it  I used to love that  when I was a kid  bam  my stepdad  used to take me  Billy Manchington  and he made me sit there  I had a headache  all the time  because of that  I told you about the steak  listen  but I remember  I was so sick  I wanted to go  and he wouldn't let me go 
[01:57:30]  because he wanted to see  the truck  the jet truck  the jet truck  yeah  and then I puked  on the lady's head  in front of me  good for you  and wrecked his day  yeah he was mad  he beat the shit out of me  he was mad  oh that's wonderful  you little fucking  cock sack  you still talk to this guy  no my mother divorced him  fucking asshole  yeah let's find him  what a douche  let's find him  and beat him up  and suck his cock  how old were you  it's poppy  how old were you  teach him a lesson  yeah how do you like  he cock sack now  by a 37 year old 
[01:58:00]  chunky bald guy  huh  not so cute anymore  huh  you liked it  when I was cute  oh god  oh my god  I'm kidding  I didn't blow him  I was first grade  to fifth grade  but he used to  beat the shit out of me  he'd punch you  right in the face  oh he'd throw me  downstairs and shit  a stepfather  oh he used to  beat the fuck out of me  did he have any kids  of his own  that were like  brought along  his baggage  never had kids  but his dad  was like that  fucking army dude  and he was a dick too  and he must have  beat the shit out of him  so I'm  yeah  the last time  he ever hit me  I actually chased him 
[01:58:30]  around the house  with a hatchet  good  and he didn't think  I was going to stab him  and he put his hand  he'd go ahead  little punk  and I thought  without even hesitating  I just brought  the fucking hatchet down  he moved his hand  and it was the first time  I saw like a grown man  scared  wow  oh yeah  wow wielding a hatchet  how old were you  at that point  I was in 6th grade  wow  that's intense  Lizzy boredom  I thought it would  get a little more  Lizzy boredom  it was alright  I liked it  yeah right  does this guy know 
[01:59:00]  your Robert Kelly  nope  I haven't seen him since  the last time I saw him  he was on my mom  trying to get one last  pluck in before  they got the worst  oh shit  that's the last time  you saw him  for real  he had money though  I remember he had  the Monte Carlo  with the T-tops  he made me use to  wash the spokes  remember spokes  get the chrome  get the chrome clean  oh it's spokes  yeah he had  one of those hot cars  and back then  it was a really  cool car  and then 
[01:59:30]  they were getting  divorced  and he didn't  want to get  divorced  so he actually  bought Atari  but when it first  came out  and he kind of  me and my sister  are such  spineless assholes  you know all the  you accepted the  Atari  we were like  oh she came home  you're like  fuck the beatings  this is an Atari  we were all sitting  around like  fucking a family  me my sister  and him  like nothing  ever happened  for five years  she came home  you little  motherfuckers  and then  that night  I walked in on him  and he was on  top of her  trying to get  one last pluck  in  and I saw  he was a 6'4 
[02:00:00]  dude  big guy  but he had  a little tiny  pud  you saw his pud  I was trying  to fucking  stick it in my  mom  I know a thing  or two  about a thing  or two  did he ever  shove a mustard  jar in your eye  and sell your  rifle for a bulldog  nobody shook up  a coke and  stuck it in my  ass  no I'm joking  are you  the president  did that  man  that's sad  Bobby  Jesus  that's rough  I want to beat  the guy up  I want to beat  him up now  I haven't seen him 
[02:00:30]  I saw him one time  I was working at  Grossman's Bargain Outlet  cutting rugs  really  I remember I used to  like during the middle  of the day  I'd roll myself up  in the carpet  to take a nap  people would come in  and just unroll the carpet  to look at it  and I'd be in there  like hey  can I help you  and he came in  I don't understand  why people like you  who had an asshole  stepfather like that  or people that were  sexually abused  don't just beat  the fuck out  of the guy  you don't have to  kill him or anything  but just like  knock on the door  if some guy  fucked me in the ass 
[02:01:00]  I would fucking  spend the rest of my  life trying to find him  and do it again  he never did  anything sexual  no no I'm not  talking about that  just for being a  douchebag  you should punch him  in the face  but like if people  are sexually assaulted  if you're some  fucking little kid  and then you grow up  into being a man  you gotta go to the  house knock on the  door and just punch  him in the fucking  face  she's making  blow you  like in front of  his family  why is everyone  blowing everyone  why Bobby  how humiliating  that would be  if he got over 
[02:01:30]  that phase  of his life  now he's got  a wife and kids  he's going  that would kind  of be funny  though  he's just like  but I have a wife  and kids  I'm sorry  I'm  pushing it in  there  one of those  fucking choke  blow videos  right  and then just  drop you a seed  in his little  kid's lunch bag  why did you have  to bring the kids  into it  he brought me  into it  I was thinking  down his mouth  I'm sorry  was there a  fucking big difference  I don't know  how you brought  me into this  moment  down his mouth 
[02:02:00]  swallow that  faggot  hold his nose  I was trying to  remember the name  of the movie  Matt's got it  Matt on Long  Island  go ahead  yeah whenever  Bobby talks  about his  childhood  it reminds me  of that movie  Radio Flyer  oh yeah  with what do they  call him  the king  that movie  is so  god damn  depressing  don't rent  that one  Bobby  what was that  what was it  called  radio flyer  the kid would  get beat  with an  extension cord  and they  hit it on 
[02:02:30]  the father  and then he  found it in  the oven  and beat him  with it  anyway  I remember  I came home  I think I was  in 5th grade  something like  that happened  I was going  to Catholic  school at the  time  they actually  kicked me  out of Catholic  school because  of him  because I  would come  in all the  time  he punched  me right  in the face  and I  just had a  black eye  and I  had to go  to school  I just  remember  standing in  a stoop  at a drug  store crying  and then I  went to school  and the nun  was like  what's wrong  but that's  when I  learned  like crying  gets you  nowhere  so I  just would  find nothing  what's wrong 
[02:03:00]  nothing  had a big  black eye  and then  that's when  I just was  like fuck  it  and then I  went after  him with  a hatchet  and that  pussy ran  12  13  right  12  13  yeah  that's why  he never  beat him  up  he was  too young  radio flyer  one of the  kids dies  in the end  though  oh really  you ruined  it  I've been  great  people are  running to  go get  radio flyer  you have to  get  not to  switch the  subject  you have  to  but the  two  brothers  were going  to run  away  with their  radio flyer 
[02:03:30]  and get  away from  everything  I wish  I had  a brother  I had a  sister that  hung out  with fags  that was  my only  option  it's called  a fag  hag  I remember  she brought  me over  this guy's  house one  day  and it was  just mattresses  in a room  and he was  I was like  what the fuck  is this  I was 13  though  and he was  like what's it  well we have  a party here  and I was like  I gotta go  I gotta go  party on the  mattresses  all I need is to  fucking be  raped by a  fag  punched in the  face by my  stepdad  this is great 
[02:04:00]  what a life  you really had  some upbringing  a fucking  alcoholic  it's a good  prerequisite  for being a  comic though  those horror  stories like  that you know  yeah  any comic  with their  parents still  together in a  happy life  I fucking  don't trust  yeah  they stole  their jokes  yeah  why is that  well because  you need  look to find  everything funny  in life  you need to  have tragedy  you need to  fucking  be able to  you know  see it from  the other side  also to seek 
[02:04:30]  the approval  of complete  strangers is not  a normal calling  if you have  two loving  parents  that pick  you up  and give  you approval  every day  you don't  need it  from some  fucking  stranger  in a saloon  you know  it's not  normal  oh that's  so fucking  nerve  and it's not  even  it's not even  just the crowd  the whole crowd  even when I look  out and I see  one person  like looking  not having fun  I need to go  what the fuck's  wrong with you  what the fuck  why  fuck's wrong  with you dad  yeah

[02:06:00]  going to  fuck up  someday  she was  the typical  just suburban  mom  oh  really  and then  one day  she ran  off with a  Jew  rabbi  or something  what was he  a lawyer  a Jew  lawyer  yeah  ran off  with a  Jew  divorce  lawyer  oh  sure  this isn't  running  with scissors  running  with scissors  you were all  adults at this  point  i was 20  yeah  so my brother  was 19  you developed  your mom  just walked  out  oh yeah  haven't seen  her since  my father  did that  actually  your real  father  my real  dad  wasn't in

[03:01:30]  guaranteeing that  good guys will  die at the hands  of evil because  you won't let us  carry guns  what he's talking  about is two  fucking those  two special  auxiliary cops  they don't have  guns but no one  told them to chase  a guy without guns  down a street  it's terrible that  they got shot  but you don't  have guns  he does  fucking wait  it out  their job  is to make  a phone call  make the phone  call to the  cops  they actually  they weren't  pursuing him  they were  following him  they weren't  pursuing the  guy they were  following him  on the other  side of the 
[03:02:00]  street from  a distance  the guy  and radioing  in to get  the real  cops there  the guy  turns around  saw that they  were following  him ran  across the  street and  shot the two  guys  he didn't  want to be  followed  he just  had some  spaghetti  and shot  a bartender  who wants  to be  followed  after a  murder  like hey  guys  I'm going  to make  a left  on what's  forth  I think  they were  trying to be  a little  sneaky about  it  can you imagine  that guy  starts running  at you  they did  they tried  to take 
[03:02:30]  cover  and duck  and it's  just awful  it's a fine line  between a  fucking utility  cop and a  fucking eagle scout  apparently  how can you guys  have a cop  and not have  a fucking gun  I know  unless you live  in London  I agree  with Uncle Ted  on that one  there should be  no more half  of cops  arm everybody  that's right  either a cop  or a  remember Archie  Bunker's  sue everybody  sue everybody  remember Archie  Bunker's stance  on hijacking  when he said  hand out guns  at the beginning  of the flight  to everyone  on there  he goes  yeah a guy  it'd be crazy  to pull a rod  out during the 
[03:03:00]  flight knowing  everyone's packing  so everyone  gets a gun  on the plane  and he was  doing one of  those like  commentary things  so he's all  serious  on the local  news  and he used  to have  the classic  that was a  great  great  on the family  yeah he was  down at Kelsey's  and then they  get robbed  at the end  there was some  line he did  once  I forget  what Mike  Stibbock  was talking  about a guy  with a  a guy

[03:09:30]  and I have  three herniated  discs in my  back  did the doctors  try to read  the mra  and say we  can't read  past this  watermark  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  mra  oh boy  swing and 
[03:10:00]  a miss  jimbo  get the  letter  wrong  they'll  jump on  you  you gotta  see the  face he made  as he slams  his back  I can  point  so what  the herniated  disc  what does  that mean  it means  that I  have  that  quickly  yeah thank  you  it means  that  queer  every  day  what  really  that's  what it  means  surprisingly  it does  and it's 
[03:10:30]  odd that  that would  have such  an impact  on my  sexual  orientation  but  the  spine  is  made up  of  bone  and it's  compressed  and it's  pushing into  my spinal  cord which is  causing my  right arm  to go  numb  they actually  have discs  between the  vertebrae  and when you  have herniated  one  it kind of  squishes out  a little bit  squishes out  so the top 
[03:11:00]  three in my  neck are  squished  so your  right arm  is going numb  my right arm  has been going  numb for about  three months  and it hits  the nerves  because they're  like little  donuts  and there's  a lot of  nerves going  through the  middle of  them  and out  over the  tops of  them  and through  them  it's an  amazing  thing  nerves  they're  all over  the place  and then  when they  get squished  it interrupts  with the  nerve  and things  go numb  like his  fucking head  what can  they do  for you  well they  can remove  the things  in the most  extreme cases 
[03:11:30]  and fuse  the vertebrae  together  I know  everything  and this  is very  funny because  then he'll  walk around  like Frankenstein  because then  you can't  really move  your neck  you can also  shave them  down though  what's  popping out  yeah it  depends on  how extreme  it is  not the  best  surgery  in extreme  cases  yes they  have to  operate  and either  fuse the  vertebrae  together  or shave  them down  I have told  them I would  really appreciate  it if they  didn't operate  on my back  so I will 
[03:12:00]  entertain any  physical therapy  or anything  that they can  suggest but  I'm not  going to  any  but you  don't want  to go  well  I know how  you can stretch  your back  a little bit  so  take it in  the  hiney  take it  in your  hiney  that's just  a character  I want to  go backwards  a little bit  Jay from  Florida  from  Wackbag  writes  MRA  gets  vaudeville 
[03:12:30]  Jim  the big  hook  that's  right  Jim was  having none  of that  today  so  so I got  to go back  for an  EMG test  today  which  from what  I've  for the  limited  amount  I've  read  it's  I guess  they stick  like some  little needles  in you  and then  they try  to  I think  they run  current  through it  I'm not  really sure  and  it's just  further testing  to see how  extensive the  damage is  when are you  going to  stop  obsessively  working out  well I had 
[03:13:00]  to actually  and then I  had to  stop  obsessively  taking  supplements  that's  fun  that wasn't  hurting my  back  I'm serious  how'd you  do it  to your  neck  I have  no idea  I really  don't know  lower back  is usually  where it's  at  I don't  really know  it's some  exercise  that you've  been straining  the shit  out of  it was  probably  some  back and  shoulder  exercise  and I  thought  what I  had for  months  was these  knots  that were  just  going  unresolved  or a pinch  nerve  and it  got crushed  from men's  teeth  because you're 
[03:13:30]  gay  homosexual  horse  hooves  on the  shoulders  who's  a docile  looking  creature  that's  hilarious  yeah I thought  it was  something else  there's a part  in Jim's act  that's just  fucking hysterical  about that  you gotta 
[03:14:00]  see it  of what  I missed  out  Jim does  a thing  in his act  about the  guy that  got fucked  by the horse  and got killed  and it's so  fucking funny  your description  of it  and the way  you move  it's really  fucking funny  Tug McGroin  writes  Tug McGroin  the Tug  he's writing  as Steve  I don't want  them to do  surgery on my  back  because my  insurance  doesn't cover  the three  days of  shaving  they'll need  to do  before the  operation  it'll look  like when  they operate 
[03:14:30]  on gorillas  but not  that smart  he's just  getting smashed  here  poor fuck  is  like all  fucked up  neurosurgeons  are involved  MRIs  or MRAs  sorry Steve  no you're not  what's that  thing on your  arm to help  this is just  my  it's an icy  hot sleeve  to just  distract me  from the  fact that  my arm  goes numb  every time  I put it  on the  it goes  numb  yeah like  when I 
[03:15:00]  type  or when  I put  my arms  on the  tip  of my  index  finger  my forefinger  and my  thumb  are completely  asleep  right now  and my  forearm  is just  the hand  bones  connected to  the brain  bone  where the  fuck did  Mike go  holy shit  Mike in  Delaware  is suggesting  that your  arms numb  from all  the ass  to mouth  sex  but that  doesn't make  any sense  it's funny 
[03:15:30]  of course  not  spinal  decompression  yes I  went through  that  thank you  Mike in  Brooksville  ask your  chiro about  spinal  decompression  you know  what's  interesting  the doctors  don't like  chiropractors  and chiropractors  don't like  doctors  you get  completely  conflicting  information  from that  may be  true  but I  wouldn't  put it  under the  umbrella  of  interesting  did I say  it was  interesting  oh fuck  that was  the least  interesting  thing  I could  fuck me 
[03:16:00]  for prefacing  that with  interesting  oh poor  fucking  Steve  man  why  you're  making me  feel bad  Steve might  be right  but the way  he set it  up  stop the  presses  I have  a film  idea  the doctor  versus  the chiropractor  it's a  five part  series  like the  Star Wars  trilogy  three and  five  picture this 
[03:16:30]  if you will  they're in a  court of law  let's go to  James the trucker  James  hey I'm  trying to  have a  moment here  could you  please lay  off the  jokes  please  fucking  assholes  I have to  wear this  padded  fucking  collar  when I  sleep  would you  make it  out of the  ones on  your knees  a padded

[03:19:00]  from Hoboken  is saying  that Steve  just called  it a  cervical  collar  he did  actually  it is called  a cervical  collar  say fuck  what did he  say it was  supposed to be  well I'm  thinking cervical  it went into  my cervix  yes I  checked  the box  actually says  cervical  collar  cervix  is from  the  the  latin  cervix  which is  a circular  it is a  ring  it is  I have  no idea  no cervix  actually comes  from the latin  meaning to  serve 
[03:19:30]  the number  nine  do you  think  ix  ix  ix  ix  swimwalk  into a  fucking  woodchipper  dude do you  think that  do you think  the discs  were pushed  out of place  by maybe  deep throating  too much  cock meat  oh  cock meat  nothing but  cock meat  just pushing  him all the way  through  might have been  from the inside  hitting the back  of his  you think it's  hitting like  the other side 
[03:20:00]  of his spine  wow  the concept  was there  deep dicking  i just didn't  get there  my vertebrae  hurts  and i have  a helmet  print  and my  adenoids  on the latin  neck  oh i'm  gay  oh  damn  steve  you don't  have to  blurt that  out every  two seconds  sorry  what  what  what 
[03:20:30]  what  what  oh  oh 
[03:21:00]  Oh, I didn't realize, bro.  All right, what do you got, Jimmy?  Let's just say you're talking to a girl.  Let's just say that it's a girl that you're in love with or whatever.  And I'm not saying this happened to my girlfriend.  I'm just saying if it never happened.  And you're talking about an experience she had that she said sexually was not good. 
[03:21:30]  Like, ah, man, I really felt bad.  It was gross.  And then you're at dinner talking, and she goes, I just remembered, like, I came four times during that.  But it was really repulsive.  So she came even though it was bad?  Wow.  That happened to me one time years ago.  She brought it up.  Well, I had actually.  How did it get brought?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait a minute.  You mean something that happened with her and somebody else?  Yeah.  What happened was this.  I was dating a girl once who had a sexual encounter.  She was talking about it. 
[03:22:00]  What was the sexual encounter that she had?  Just had sex with a guy.  I mean, it really was nothing major.  How was it brought up?  I ask sex questions.  Oh, okay.  But I forget how.  Why would you do that to yourself?  I'm crazy.  You ask a girl about sex she said before.  Oh, yeah.  Why would you torture her?  And she said it was bad before and then she later said she came four times during it.  Well, like, yeah, but she said it was bad.  Not bad like a rape, but just like, ugh, I felt gross.  It wasn't enjoyable.  But she came four times.  Was it because of, was it because of, I know you don't want to get into specifics, so we'll go around. 
[03:22:30]  No, no, no.  I see how far you want to go.  Was it because of who the person was, the location, the sex act?  Like, what about this situation was repulsive to her?  I think it was the person that she was hooking up with.  I think she wasn't that, again, I didn't get into all the details.  I think it was like someone that she wasn't that attracted to, but just kind of liked as a person.  I think it was more like that kind of vibe.  Like, it wasn't, it was completely consensual, but it was like, eh. 
[03:23:00]  It wasn't any type of a negro.  It wasn't like a negro.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I just thought I'd throw that out there.  No, don't put that thought in my head.  No, no, no.  It was just like that, and it wouldn't have been a big deal if she enjoyed it.  It was like years before we met.  It was nothing.  So what's the problem?  My question is, it was not really a problem.  It was like, oh, it was really gross.  And then, like, we were talking about something.  How much later?  Did hours go by or days go by? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, like, weeks.  Weeks went by.  And then saying I was reading something, I wrote about it at the time.  Like, kept, like, a diary or something.  And goes, I came four times.  I didn't even remember that.  Like, I didn't remember that that happened.  So she remembered it being gross, but then thinking, looking back at her records.  Her records of the fuck.  I went to the hall of sexual records.  It says here I came four times.  I'm so surprised.  I remember her saying that.  No, but she's still saying it.  She's like, maybe you don't understand, but to me it was like a weird reaction.  It still wasn't a sexy experience to me, even though I did. 
[03:24:00]  I kind of believe her, but I don't.  But here's my question for you.  Does this concern you, or are you just curious about it?  More curiosity.  I don't know if it concerns me or not.  Is it a threat to me?  No.  I mean, it was long before people ever knew each other.  You're trying to learn something about your girl if you're trying to understand.  Did you ask her about it?  Yeah, I don't know.  It's not actually the girl I'm dating now.  It's an old girl.  No, of course.  Years ago.  Of course.  I don't know.  It's just fucking sex freaks me out, man.  See, it's kind of, he doesn't feel threatened by it now, but there's something about it that 
[03:24:30]  isn't sitting right.  Right.  Because you were told it was this repulsive kind of thing like that, yet her coming four  times in some way makes you feel like you're not doing something you could be doing.  Coming isn't always a positive, I mean, I mean, I was getting blown by a hooker in a condemned  building once with like a broken window and I thought I was going to get mugged because 
[03:25:00]  she had some weird friend in the next room.  It was a really bad situation and I came, you know.  No, no, no.  That girl later became my wife.  That's right.  But I'm saying like, I was even at the time joking with her and I'm like, you know, you  don't like, just a word of advice, you don't tell the guy you're dating that you came four  times with someone when the guy you're dating has never made you come four times.  Oh, I see.  Like, you don't.  You're asking the question.  No, no, no, no.  I know. 
[03:25:30]  I know.  I know.  That's what I'm not mad.  I wasn't mad then.  You haven't broken that record.  I don't know what it is.  I can't give you a logical answer.  Are you sure she wasn't kidding?  Why would you ask to?  That would be hysterical.  What a great joke to play on Jimmy just to sit there and laugh and go, I bet this fucker  is toiling over this.  I don't know.  Why?  There's like a certain line you go through.  Have you made her come yet?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know.  But not four times.  Is that really the thing?  Four times by having a lousy fucking time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, I just, it's almost like, I don't know. 
[03:26:00]  I'm in therapy now.  I went back to therapy.  So I'm like, oh, it's weird sexual questions and stuff.  Not like, you know, but just like bizarre.  Like, what do I like sexually?  Like, am I a pervert?  Do I want to spank somebody?  Do I want to be gentle?  Like, I don't even know when I'm turned on half the time.  It's like, I'm such an addict.  I jerk off so much.  I'm having this weird stuff.  Your therapist can't wait for you to come in.  I'm late.  She's never complained.  Ah, don't worry.  Sit.  Well, no, you're the kind of patient she trained for.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a mess.  She told me.  Everybody else is like, my boss did something weird today. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Right, right.  Get Jimmy in here.  I just fucking hook her shat in my mouth.  I'm not sure how I felt about it.  Is it kind of a...  Well, Jim, let's talk.  I can't believe you asked the current girlfriend about her past.  I know.  She said to me, she goes...  Wow.  She goes, I've never had a guy ask me these questions before.  That's good.  And a part of me does it because...  I think most guys out there would not ask.  Yeah, but a part of me is like...  A part of me, A, likes to hurt myself.  So wants to hear bad things.  But if there's a weird OCD thing I have, which you'll get, it's like... 
[03:27:00]  I almost feel like it's dishonest.  If there's a fact there, like...  I almost like, if it's not spoken about, it's dishonest.  I know that sounds crazy, but it's like, if I'm fucking a girl, right, and she doesn't  think my dick is big enough, even though she loves me and she's enjoying sex with me,  if she doesn't think my dick's big enough, that's a fact.  So it's almost like, I don't want to be patronized by not being told that.  Like, do you understand what I'm saying?  No, that's all problems inside of your brain.  You're fine, right?  If you're fucking a girl...  Oh, my God. 
[03:27:30]  This is Jim's brain.  Okay.  He's fucking a girl.  What you should be thinking of is, oh, pussy around my dick.  I can't wait to come in her stupid mouth.  Yes.  That's all you should be thinking.  But you're thinking, I know that deep down inside she thinks my dick's not small enough,  and if she would just tell me instead of this facade of screaming while I fuck her.  You're out of your mind.  He probably puts it in and looks for this reaction, and if he doesn't get it, he's thinking,  is my dick too small for this girl?  My dick's too small.  And she's not being honest and telling her.  That's right.  And his ideal situation would be for her to go, Jimmy, your dick is just not big enough 
[03:28:00]  for me.  And you'd be, oh, the honesty, thank you.  No, but I'd be devastated.  Of course you would.  That's what I'm saying.  You're digging in her subconscious mind and in her past for something to bum yourself out  with.  Yes.  You have a beautiful girlfriend that is funny and that loves you, and you're looking  for some shit.  She told me that, too.  You're looking for some crap.  Yeah, what are you fucking looking for?  She said, and I quote, why won't you just let me love you? 
[03:28:30]  Oh, God.  No, no, no.  It's that simple.  Because my dick's too small, and you're a whore that came four times with a guy you hated.  You're dishonest.  But she said to me, she goes, why would you, she goes, why do you think you don't have  what I want?  The point I'm making by telling you this stuff.  You don't think you deserve her?  I pretty much know that it's me.  I'm not an idiot.  Pretty much.  Here's what I would say, Joe.  You could be absolutely sure.  Here's the good news, is that you're a little more conscious and aware than somebody who  just says, fucking whore doesn't like my dick. 
[03:29:00]  No.  But you actually, you're aware that you've got to, you're trying to figure this out,  which means you probably won't figure it out.  Yeah, and you are.  You're a lot more fucking, like, reasonable about this stuff than I think you used to be.  Because I know her well enough to know this.  She doesn't cheat.  Like, she doesn't fucking sleep around.  She never, like, I know all these things that I actually know.  I don't just believe because she said it because I know it.  So it's like, well, if I'm having these thoughts, it's got to be fucking, I'm crazy.  Like, I'm fucking, sometimes I think I'm fucking, like, I'm, like, not crazy in a fun way, 
[03:29:30]  but then I'm, like, crazy.  You're trying to take a good thing away from yourself.  Yeah, maybe.  That might be it.  You've spent a lot of your life coping with being unhappy, and now things are going for you.  You're a talented comedian.  You've got a career.  You're actually starting to take care of yourself physically, and you've got a girlfriend,  and you're not used to that.  So coping with good life is hard if you don't have the skills.  I keep waiting for the same thing.  So you're trying to go to a comfortable place, which is misery, because you've given yourself  a life of comfort and misery.  Your therapist is Louis C.K.?  I know.  It's fucking awful.  What the fuck happened? 
[03:30:00]  And he can't wait for Wednesday afternoons.  But I fucking, it's almost like, I know I've talked about this stuff before, but I know  I'm not alone with it.  I know other guys think it, and I don't know if it's just part of my personality or part  of being a comedian, but I just say it.  I mean, maybe it's just part of my personality, because I'm sure non-comics have this shit,  too.  Yeah.  Like, a friend of mine told me he used to bang his wife, and he would want her to fantasize  and talk about other guys.  And like, I, you know, a way I can understand that, and a way I can't.  Would I want to watch my girl fuck another guy?  Absolutely not. 
[03:30:30]  Can it turn me on to think about her just being like, in this dirty porn situation, and just  sexually?  Sure.  Because I love her, and I'm attracted to her.  To actually see her doing it?  Absolutely not.  So I could never go that far.  No.  Yeah, your mind is fun.  It's sexually stimulating.  But I don't know how to take this stuff.  That's what fantasy is.  But that's also what the past is.  It's nothing more than a fucking vapor cloud of what was, you know?  So you probably shouldn't dwell on that.  I know.  I'm just trying to find a way out of the good. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, you're looking for some way out of the good fucking life you're having, because  you're so used to being miserable, and you feel you deserve to be miserable.  For some reason, you don't feel you deserve happiness.  Yeah, that's what I think it is.  And I don't know why the fuck you would think that.  You don't like every other human.  You don't like yourself well enough.  And was there torturing of little animals growing up?  No.  Is there something in your past that would lead you to not want you to be happy?  You know, there is one other possibility.  Somebody doesn't.  Maybe you just know, because it's true, that you don't deserve to be happy, because you're 
[03:31:30]  a bad guy.  Maybe you're just a bad person.  Maybe you're just an asshole.  No.  I would say that someone disappointed you.  I think you're right.  In your formative years, something that you're looking forward to, and you just got to take  it away from you.  To manifest into this would have to be a pretty big disappointment.  I think that's probably true.  Not like missing ice cream one day.  And incidentally, my only act of bravery as a child was saving a cat from being tortured  from the neighborhood bully.  I let it out of the box.  Did you?  Yes.  If you flew airplanes, and every time you flew one, it crashed, and somehow you survived, 
[03:32:00]  after a while, you're going to start looking for soft places to crash.  At least I could crash in that field, and not in that fucking thorny tree this time.  So you're looking, I think that Opie's right.  Somebody bummed you out.  Do other people deal with this shit, though?  It's like, I know this is not, I'm not so fucking unique.  No, it's not.  Let's go to the phones.  We got a bunch of guys.  Josh in Florida.  What's up, Josh?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  I think it has something to do with, you want them to tell you everything so that you might 
[03:32:30]  have something to resent them for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that...  Oh, Josh.  Stop phoning it in.  Oh, wait.  There's a caller.  I'm sorry.  It's really the only way he can communicate with the show.  So I apologize.  Go ahead, Josh.  That you might have something to resent them for so that when it goes, inevitably it goes  south, you don't hate yourself.  I do stuff like this.  Like, I'll actually, like, I'm running through a scenario the other day, and it's completely 
[03:33:00]  ridiculous.  This is the scenario I run through.  Oh, fuck.  No, no.  But this is how fucking crazy I am.  I do this.  She and I are talking in instant message.  And, like, and I've done this before.  Like, you ever been talking to someone, and then someone I ams you, and instead of I am-ing  the person you were talking to, the new I am that clicked on gets the second half of  your sentence, and then we came home yesterday.  And then you're like, what the fuck?  You I am me at the wrong time.  So I was going through this scenario that I was talking to my girlfriend, and she's  talking to some guy who I don't know about, and then I am her when she's not expecting 
[03:33:30]  it, and I get her I am meant for somebody else, and it says, well, he's going to Sacramento  this week.  Maybe we could see each other Saturday.  Well, that could be anything.  Right.  So you just make that up, and then you enjoy, and then you get mad at it.  But not even as a fantasy.  It's just like the way, like, you run through a race or something.  You run through something in your head.  You play it out.  But then all of a sudden-  But yours comes out into real-  Yes!  Emotion.  The actual emotion comes from this fantasy. 
[03:34:00]  No, it's like the Grouch and Duck Soup.  Groucho Marx is-  Thanks for taking my point seriously and fucking relating it to Duck Soup.  It's like Daffy Duck said what he-  So he's the president of Fredonia, and he's going to meet the president of some other  funny country.  And he's- because they're supposed to go to war, and he wants to- so he says, I'll shake  his hand.  I'll give him my hand in friendship.  But what if he refuses my hand?  How dare he refuse my hand? 
[03:34:30]  And all I was trying to do was be his friend, and he makes a fool of me.  How dare-  And by the time the guy shows up, he goes, you idiot!  And he slaps him in the face and starts a war.  I do that all the time.  I get furious at shit I made up in my head.  Wow, that is fucked up.  I get really angry.  That is completely fucked up.  That really is fucked up.  But I know it's not real, so I get myself mad.  But then the residue is there, like the smoke.  Yeah.  So I have a bad feeling towards her.  So I-  Holy shit, a genuine bad feeling towards her.  Yep, you're trying to-  Completely made up fucking- 
[03:35:00]  But the emotion is there.  And she's told me, she's like, you have these scenarios, and then your argument is to try  to make that a reality.  And she's fucking really-  I gotta say, she's a brilliant person.  I can't-  Well, see, that's why I think this is gonna work out, because I hear you saying that you  guys are talking about this, and that it's-  Well, constantly.  So it's great.  You ever fantasize that she brings two broads over with you?  No.  With her and says, here, come on, let's go.  And then you have this good feeling about her the whole time, Jim?  Yep.  No, like, she buys you a nice car.  Let's go to Logan.  Logan from Texas.  What's up, Logan? 
[03:35:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Love the show.  I thought it was our Elo who fantasizes that his wife brings home a serious-  That's his idea of, like, marital humiliation.  Hey, you're-  Holds the anger.  Logan is saying that he's sicker than Jimmy.  What's the story, Logan?  Okay.  I married this girl.  I've been married two years now.  I fucking am sicker than the questions-  With the questions than Jimmy.  I fucking make this shit up in my head.  Like what?  What do you make up in your head?  Give us an example. 
[03:36:00]  I tell-  I asked her one day if she had ever slept with an N, and she said, yes, she had.  And now, every time-  She's a delivery driver for a fucking auto parts store, and she has to deliver to all these  auto parts-  Slept with a what?  A black guy.  He called it an N, like a Sesame Street-  Did you ever sleep with a letter N?  Yes.  And you fucking Sesame Street whore.  Why didn't you just say black guy instead of N?  An N.  He wanted to be a little more offensive. 
[03:36:30]  Wait, dude, you said, did you ever sleep with a black guy?  She said what?  She said yes.  In real life, she said yes.  Yes, I am fucking just-  I fucking am way paranoid.  She works at an auto parts store and delivers parts to these auto parts-  These fucking mechanic shops, and I think she sleeps with fucking wet backs and niggers  with huge-  Oh, Jesus.  Well, he's just abandoned that whole polite N thing pretty quick.  Why would she cheat on such a charmer? 
[03:37:00]  She picked the perfect way to get back at you.  So, no, see, that's actually one thing that I don't care about.  Like, I don't-  I never ask my-  I'm like, I ask my girlfriend if you ever date a black guy, and she's like, no.  But I never ask her if she ever slept with a girl, and I just don't care about it.  Well, there's your next question.  But no, it wouldn't-  Hold on, sir.  It wouldn't bother me.  That doesn't-  That doesn't freak me out.  Nah, I don't give a fuck.  I've fucked black girls before.  Who cares?  Me either in real life, but I'm just fucking-  All right, I'll-  Yeah, that doesn't freak me out.  Let's go to Bruce.  Bruce, what's up?  You have the same problem as Jimmy?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey, guy, Jen, how you doing? 
[03:37:30]  Or you start where you want to start.  Go ahead.  Yeah, just-  All right.  I just wanted to agree with Jimmy, man.  I got the same damn problem.  I don't know what it is, but it's like-  That's my question to start the phone call.  Watch our what?  I just wanted him to cut to the chase.  Tell me.  All right, go ahead, Bruce.  It's like when you're finally happy, you just-  You can't stand it.  You gotta fucking be miserable.  Again.  Sorry.  Didn't mean to drop the F, Bob.  No, we're on XM.  It's satellite now.  Cocknuck.  Dopey ass fuck dick shit. 
[03:38:00]  I used to have these fantasies, like I was with my wife once we got in a fight in the  kitchen, and then I went upstairs to put one of the kids to sleep.  And as my daughter's sleeping in my arms, I start picturing, I go downstairs, and she's  got a knife, and she just sticks it right in my chest.  Like, I got this, like, really vivid-  Wow.  Funny she was thinking the same thing.  I played it all out like I'm in a flight simulator.  I'm like, all right, then what do I do?  I push her hand away.  Maybe I'm still- She didn't kill me.  And I throw her in the closet, lock the door. 
[03:38:30]  Wow.  And then what do I do?  I'm bleeding to death.  I've got to get the kids out of the house.  But then as soon as I'm in my head in an ambulance, being led away, I'm, like, happy.  Because, like, now everybody knows.  It's like the UN's got to come in with blue helmets.  Everybody knows now that she's fucking crazy.  She's nuts.  It's been proven.  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  There's no one that will blame me for not going back to that house.  This is fucking beyond me.  The closest I could even come to anything like this is if you have a dream, which is more than just having this daydream type thing. 
[03:39:00]  It's, like, got a little more viscosity to it, you know?  You got a little more to grab onto when it's a dream.  And then you wake up for the dream.  And for a very short time where you're still in that groggy period, you look over and go, you fuck.  You fucking do that to me?  But it doesn't manifest into this fucking grudge that you hold onto and a little piece of it.  I have to still be in that sleep-awake portion. 
[03:39:30]  But that's about as close as I can get to what you guys are talking about.  The only good thing is I do get over it.  I would hold onto this shit for a long time with people.  Again, I'm really nuts with some of this shit.  But, like, the last time this happened, it was, like, we actually went home and, like, she's, like, what's wrong with you?  And I'm, like, I did, like, I was, like, by the end of the night, but by an hour later, we were, like, kissing and everything was good.  We had sex.  It was great.  Like, as opposed to it being a week long. 
[03:40:00]  Like, I give myself credit.  Like, it's improving vastly.  You're getting better.  Because we communicate a lot.  And it's, like, I know it's me.  She's done nothing wrong.  She's not a perfect girl, but she doesn't cheat.  She doesn't fucking.  None of it.  It's just I'm trying to find something to fucking wreck it.  But, again, you're not just doing it.  You're going.  You're thinking about it.  You're making up shit.  Yeah, we got another wrinkle from Charlie in Philly.  Charlie, what's up?  What's up, Obi, Andy?  Jimmy and Louie.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man, you forgot fan, but go right ahead, selfish.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:40:30]  Jimmy.  Yes.  I've been married 21 years, and I go through all these scenarios with my wife and talk to her.  Maybe it subconsciously turns you on, and it actually makes you set a goal to be better than the other guy.  I do it to a point where I get so turned on and enraged at the same time, I hate to fuck the shit out of her and just leave her laying there like a corpse on the bed.  But it's awesome.  It feels so good.  So for me, there's a balance between that stuff.  Like, there's a place where I could find my girlfriend being sexual with another person in theory and in talk to be very sexy because I'm attracted to her physically. 
[03:41:00]  I mean, I'm a perv.  So to think of my girl fucking a guy with a 10-inch dick, do I want to see that?  Like, never.  To think about it, like, just to see her being dirty, yeah, I could fantasize.  But then there's the little invisible line I cross, and it's like, am I doing this because I'm in a silly perv mood right now,  or am I trying to hurt and degrade myself and put myself in a place that I'll never come back from?  Like, I don't – there's a weird thing I do with that.  Like, there's some times where I'm doing it because it's like, baby, you're very sexy. 
[03:41:30]  I just want to picture you fucking sucking a guy's dick while I'm fucking you because you're dirty.  I want to picture you eating another girl.  That's the way my mind is working.  And then there's other times where I'm like, okay, let's get to the reality is you want to fuck a guy with a bigger dick.  Here's a sledgehammer.  Hit me with it, and I'll never recover.  Like, there's a line there, and I don't know why I'm doing things half the time.  Wow.  Wow.  That's what I'm talking about.  Where does this shit come from?  I don't know.  Could it be the little girl who left when I was a baby?  I don't know.  It's just coming out of the evil dick.  Yeah, well, sick.  Smelly evil – I hate my dick.  I'd love to fucking cut it off and throw it in the dustbin. 
[03:42:00]  I saw it in an episode.  No, you should put it in the fucking ash can.  We go to Arizona for the answer.  It's Lindsay.  Lindsay, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  We're trying to help little Jimmy today.  I know.  He sounds so sad.  I feel so bad for him.  I'm really not – I'll be honest with you, Lindsay.  I'm really not sad.  I'm just – I don't understand what the fuck is wrong with me.  You know, it might have something to do with monster rain.  I'm just going to throw it out there because, you know, I've talked about it on the show before.  With what?  Monster rain. 
[03:42:30]  That whole time for me – I mean, talk about it in therapy.  Have you ever heard about that?  Monster rain?  You talk about it in therapy, the monster rain?  Well, the whole time because, again, my first – I have a pain love association.  I talk about it on stage.  My first – when I used to fantasize about Kiss when I was a kid – and, again, they weren't sexual –  my real fantasy about the group Kiss would be – because I worshipped them – that they would come over and –  By the way, this is hysterical.  Have you ever heard this, Luke?  I've never heard it.  Oh, boy.  But the tragic truth.  Strap in, man.  But they would – but it's not – it's just – it's not even that weird.  My fantasy was –  Oh, no, not weird at all. 
[03:43:00]  Is that Kiss would come over and they would beat me and they would hurt me badly and throw  me down a flight of steps.  And then when I was at the bottom, devastated and crying, they would come down and hug me  and love me and make it all better.  And I remembered all through my life, my fantasies of relationships have been – like, in high  school, I used to fantasize that a girl would see me being beaten, like, and bludgeoned by  people and bloody and somehow surviving it.  Like, I had these –  Well, that's – yeah, go ahead. 
[03:43:30]  Is that normal?  I mean, like, S&M, a lot of times seems like it's –  No, no, not sexual.  Nothing sexual.  Like being beat up by guys just beating you.  No –  And she would come over and –  Love me.  It's not about sex.  It wasn't an S&M thing.  You want to be healed, but you want the –  Yeah, that's right.  It's not a gay thing.  I wouldn't fantasize that men would hurt me and turn me on.  You need the pain and fucking tragedy and just fucking awfulness first before the, like,  love and shit.  You know, I –  That means somebody in his past did something.  That's the first love that you felt was something that came after something terrible 
[03:44:00]  happening.  Probably.  Somebody hurt you and somebody else hugged you and you've never felt it.  The doctor went to smack him when he came out of the womb and a finger slipped right  up his asshole.  The first – right out first breath, he got a finger up his ass.  You were violated.  You were really scared by the violation and then somebody made it good by hugging you  and going, it's okay.  But I was at a dentist once.  I have a huge dental phobia.  Like, if – I need, like, to get intravenous fucking knockout drugs to just get my teeth 
[03:44:30]  cleaned.  It's really bad.  But this guy – yeah, I'm a faggot.  One time I had a tooth removed and the guy – yeah, it was horrible and tons of blood.  It was so painful.  And then afterwards, the dentist came up to me and put his hand around – like, his  arm around me and said, you okay, buddy?  And, like, he gave me some kind of drug to make me feel better.  And I kind of wanted to kiss him, like, on the mouth.  Like, I had a love for this man because he hurt me and then he made me feel better. 
[03:45:00]  And I wanted him to fuck my face.  It is the fucking terrorist hostage situation.  Yeah.  Don't know why.  Where after a long time, you build up a relationship with these people even though they are the  ones that are putting you in this –  Stockholm Syndrome is called –  Yes.  Yep.  Let's go to Toledo and say hi to Jason.  Jason.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey.  My wife is just like Jimmy.  She just –  She's a small cock and she doesn't make anybody come either?  Well, sometimes. 
[03:45:30]  I love you, too.  Guys, I'm sorry.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  No, no.  You, buddy.  She dreams these things up that I'm fucking a neighbor and then she wakes up, she holds  it against me.  So now, every time we're around the neighbors, I'm uncomfortable as hell.  I don't know what to do.  You know, she does that all the time.  She thinks I'm fucking my cousin's wife.  See, I tend to do this – the last time I did this type of stuff was probably eight,  ten years ago. 
[03:46:00]  It was with the last girl I was – but I loved Erin when I was dating her, but I wasn't  in love with her because I didn't date her – like, I didn't know her as long  as I know this girl.  Like, I loved her.  But this girl I know for years, so I'm, like, in love with her, too.  I, for some reason, didn't do this with Erin, even though I did love her.  I don't know why.  But I was – last time I did this was for real.  It was, like, the last long-term relationship I had, which was, like, ten years ago, where  I was in love with a girl, and I would always try to fucking find out about her ex-boyfriend.  Here's the thing with dick size.  I'm fine.  My dick is fine.  But that's something that is unchangeable. 
[03:46:30]  Like, that's why I'll focus on that.  Like, because I know mentally I'm a pervert.  Like, if you want to be spanked, your hair – I know I can do that.  And I know that most things another guy did to you mentally I can do.  That's something that I can kind of handle, and I'm comfortable with that because my mind  works well.  But cock size is an unchangeable absolute.  So if that's got me beat, that's something I can hurt myself with, and I can never change.  I can never, ever fix it for as long as I live.  But it actually takes some consolation in that because it is so absolute and unchangeable 
[03:47:00]  that there is nothing you can do about it.  So that should make it that much easier to move on from.  Do you like your cock?  Yes, it's fine.  What?  You like it.  Yeah, I like it.  You know, I called yesterday in the airport.  I was so bummed out.  I called fucking –  Excuse me.  I called –  I'm sorry.  I was –  I have to burp like that.  I love burping that way.  Oh, my God.  It's a lizard burp.  It just stuck out.  That's a good one, bud. 
[03:47:30]  Get that for our machine.  It's like a shark burp.  That's a good one.  I called Patrice yesterday because Patrice and I have the same type of fucking lunacy,  and he was good to talk to because he certainly relates to all that.  I know he's a disgusting perv, and I also know that he's a vulnerable, weak, frightened nothing.  You know, he's a combination, which is nice.  And we talked about –  He's also black.  I forget that.  Whenever I'm asking for advice, I just never look at his color or I won't take the advice seriously.  But no, no.  He made some good sound.  We had a nice chat yesterday.  See, there are going to be bigger dicks. 
[03:48:00]  No, no, no, no.  And there are going to be smaller dicks.  Yes.  And whatever girl you're with, perhaps, if you inquire, will have been with smaller and or bigger dicks.  Well, I was bugging her one day about it, and I think she was annoyed at me.  She didn't know what to say.  She's like, look, well, I've definitely fucked guys with bigger dicks.  Like, did you have to – I kind of laughed, like, phrasing, baby.  Phrasing is very important.  The word definitely was not as true.  Yeah, it's almost like, hey, goose, I've been protecting you from this info.  Right.  But you're not fucking dressing yourself up in a deer suit. 
[03:48:30]  I know.  Handing a rifle to a hunter.  And then when he shoots you, you go, hey, hey, hey, hey.  But now –  No, no, no, no.  No, I'm Harry Whittington, and Dick Cheney shot me, and I'm a little surprised.  There's a difference.  I was hunting, but I wasn't going to do it.  You just left to go on TV and apologize that you were shot.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  What, sweetie?  Asking for it.  Did you get a lot of love after your suicide attempt?  Oh.  That's coming in, and I kind of like that thought there.  I will say yes and no.  It was more embarrassment, but this has been going on long before then.  When the fuck did you try to kill yourself? 
[03:49:00]  When I was drinking and stuff like that.  Really?  It was more just slight – yeah, more slight stuff.  Faggot.  Oh, yeah, I know.  It was all nonsense.  Why don't you do it, you fucking –  Believe me, you're preaching to the choir.  I fucking – you think I don't realize I should have had a gun?  I fucking –  But did you get a lot of love after the suicide attempt that you weren't getting beforehand?  Like, God.  I would say not really, no, because I was more embarrassed by the whole thing, so I didn't  want the – I was like, ugh, because I sobered up.  I was in rehab.  I felt like a douche.  Sure.  That was part of the reason I did it, was to get that feeling.  But again, it goes way before that. 
[03:49:30]  I didn't learn anything from that.  That was a behavior trying to recapture something I'd learned earlier, if that makes any sense.  It's like that suffering.  And I just had a thought, too, about the – oh, I just want to tell my girlfriend,  because she's like, I don't know why you think about this.  She's like, this is so much in your head.  This is not something I – she's like, well, I'm not having sex with you thinking I wish  you had a bigger dick.  I'm happy.  I like having sex.  And I know she's being truthful.  Is it just the way that you quoted her phrasing?  Well, okay, I've definitely had bigger dicks.  It was almost a resignation.  You were, like, forcing her to say that. 
[03:50:00]  I know.  You want to hear that come out of her mouth so that you can say, you see, you think my  dick's too small.  I'm going to go over here and jack off to something else.  If it's a fact, then it's not honest to say it.  Like, I said to her, like, let's say that we were dating and you knew that my history  was my favorite thing to do was titty fuck girls.  And I only, like, all the girls I've dated or a couple of girls that had double D tits,  and my thing was titty fucking.  I love that.  Let's say you had A breasts, which she doesn't.  But I'm like, no matter how much I loved you, you have A breasts.  Like, I want to titty fuck you. 
[03:50:30]  I'm attracted to you.  But as I love you, you're great.  But I cannot make that happen because your tits aren't what I need for that.  Yeah, you're trying really hard.  You're like a lawyer against...  But that's not that big of a stretch, though.  Yeah, but see, you're working so hard to find a way to hate your own dick.  No, no, no.  I'm actually...  But I am, in a way, working hard to explain it to somebody who thinks it's crazy.  I could get your explanation.  But is the act of titty fucking more important than everything else in your relationship?  No.  If it is, then leave the fucking relationship. 
[03:51:00]  No.  If it isn't, then just fucking deal with it and move on.  No, but if she said to me one day, you would like sex better if my tits were bigger, I couldn't deny it and say she was wrong.  Maybe, okay, no.  You could say, I fucked bigger tits.  I could, but then the fact would be, I like girls with bigger tits.  So when I said that to her, it's almost like if that's required for you, if you really like that, even though you love me and stuff, if I can't give you that, you'll still love fucking me, but there will always be that little asterisk. 
[03:51:30]  The titty fuck thing is not that crazy of an example.  No, no, it's not.  It's not.  But you're never going to find the perfect everything.  Well, the thing is, you're working in the wrong direction.  You're working really hard to say, I don't deserve this.  You should let the girl fuck somebody who just enjoys the fuck, comes on her ass and goes home, instead of the silliness.  And think of how big your dick looks between small tits.  Problem solved.  Small dick, small tits look.  But do you understand?  I don't have a small dick. 
[03:52:00]  My dick's fine.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy, don't worry.  I'm not criticizing your cock.  I've seen it.  It's beautiful.  I mean, I'm not feeling sorry for myself.  What I'm saying is, like, I don't want my dick to be fine.  I don't want to be mediocre with my dick.  This is what me and Patrice talked about.  And the way he phrased it, and he was just perfect, was something about he wants his dick to be undeniably big.  Like, no matter what country you're in, if a girl sees your dick, she knows it's big.  Like the speed of light, like not even relative to anything else.  His dick is so big. 
[03:52:30]  Undeniably big.  So anyone seeing it would go, that's a big dick.  Like, where it's not so subjective as compared to who they've fucked before.  Right.  Like, even a girl that's fucked big dicks.  And that was a great point he raised yesterday.  It was very funny.  And he made me laugh in an airport waiting for my luggage, which, that's how funny he is.  You know, I laugh waiting for my luggage.  It's better than him stomping on it.  Always appropriate.  So that was his, he made a very good point.  Read that.  But that's what I want.  And, uh, wow.  He told me my dick was nice, and I guess that just bothered him. 
[03:53:00]  It's almost like, she goes, your dick is nice.  She's a woman, she's not a guy, she's not going to say, dude, your dick is fucking awesome.  That could be said like, like, god damn, you have a nice ass.  Like, when you say that to a girl, it doesn't mean, yeah, your ass is nice.  That means that's a great fucking ass.  You've got a nice, gorgeous girlfriend who thinks your dick is nice, and you're trying to find negative.  You don't think you deserve it.  You don't think you deserve it.  I want to self-sabotage.  I know, I can't disagree.  Wow.  But there's also a little bit of validity in what I'm saying, mixed in with it, which is what makes it hard for me to let it go. 
[03:53:30]  No, there's none.  No, there's some.  I'm not partially correct.  Only if you're like a lawyer against yourself.  I am.  You're like, you're a genius at fucking yourself out of a great situation.  I know, I'm Johnny Cox size.  A lot of people say it has to go back to your childhood.  You should fucking join Al-Qaeda.  You'd make a great suicide bomber.  You just would fucking fuck this, fuck everyone.  I'm just going to fucking blow myself up and other people that think my cock is small.  It's kind of a hack bit, but we should get him hypnotized on the show.  I wouldn't be able to.  It never worked. 
[03:54:00]  I was hypnotized once when I went to therapy when I was 19 or 20 or 22.  I think I just got short.  Did it work?  They did it in front of a class because I didn't have much money.  Yeah.  Not really.  I'm not easy to hypnotize.  I've tried it, and it's very hard to get me.  All right, let's go to Lucas.  Lucas, what's up?  Hey.  First off, I love you guys.  You love the show.  Bummed about Lucky Louie, but as soon as the stores open up to get my copy of the DVD.  Nice.  Thank you.  I got to tell you this.  I'm such a dope. 
[03:54:30]  I went through the same kind of thing.  I built something up in my head so much that I got myself physically ill.  I threw up.  I called a girlfriend from work one time, and the number was blocked.  And I'm such an idiot that once I called, she answered the phone, hey, Mike, how's it going?  And I'm like, wait a minute.  And I'm just such an idiot.  I hang up.  I get myself all worked up thinking, oh, my God, she's seeing somebody else.  Who's this Mike guy? 
[03:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Everything.  And I'm in the bathroom just dry even.  I've dumped everything out of my stomach.  I'm sick to my stomach thinking about this.  I got to leave work.  I go tell my boss, look, I got to go.  I'm sick.  I don't feel good.  I'm not going to tell him the real story.  Your boss is sick.  I'm not going to tell him I'm sick.  Yeah.  And you realize that was your name.  And you realize, oh, my God, my name is Mike.  Fucking Mike.  What's wrong with me?  Go ahead, Mike.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Mike. 
[03:55:30]  I didn't know it was going to be a hit, Mike.  So I'm in the car driving home.  God, this is killing me.  I don't, I, I, I.  I really get it.  You're aggravated.  Yes.  Move to the punchline.  That's when I realized her brother is Mike.  Oh, all right.  Her brother is Mike.  And I'm such a dope.  She's fucking her brother.  She's obviously fucking her brother.  That is disgusting.  Gross.  But I got myself all worked up over it.  Yeah, well.  The only thing I can say.  How many lights did you hit on the way home? 
[03:56:00]  Holy fuck.  I say in my own favor.  It's weird.  When I was in Sacramento, I said this on the air before, that my girlfriend's family came  to see me and didn't tell me.  Oh, no.  Her aunt, her uncle, and her grandmother came to my show.  And they left without saying hi, you mean?  Yeah.  And the reason they did, it was not to be rude.  They loved the show.  She goes, they didn't want to feel like they were intruding because you didn't know they  were coming.  They're like, oh, he didn't want to meet us, that.  He was talking to people.  They just kind of felt like they didn't want to be intrusive.  So how did you take that?  Exactly like that.  They saw my bulge and laugh and walked home. 
[03:56:30]  I can't even talk to a guy with that tiny thing.  Oh, God.  That's awful.  He has Ken doll genitals.  No, no, no, no.  I was kind of glad, like, I'm not doing anything shitty.  Like, oh, my God.  I wasn't panicking.  Like, what did they say?  Like, it was like, oh, why did they come up and say hello?  Like, I was actually kind of was annoyed.  Like, I wish they would have come up and said hi.  So, like, I'm not as fucking nuts as I used to be.  And I do kind of figure this shit out.  But I'm like, why do I do that stuff?  I think you're working on it in a very healthy way, Jimmy.  Which is.  I really think, like, the fact that, yeah, you're talking to her about it is huge. 
[03:57:00]  And here's the thing, Jim, what I would say is that this thing you're doing, it is part of you.  It's not like you can't change what you're like.  If that happened to you, if something happened to you when you were a kid that makes you do this when good things happen, it's just part of you.  It's not wrong.  And if she's listening to it and taking it and she still loves you, then you guys will be all right.  And you'll always have that in your relationship that you'll keep going.  Yeah, but if a black guy came in here, gave you $2 million, would you kiss his dick and then call me an asshole?  Well, technically, yes, I would, Jim.  But fucking bitch. 
[03:57:30]  You hate me now.  But she's never done anything that indicated to me she wasn't happy.  Like, she doesn't do that.  It's not like I'm picking up.  I ask her enough questions until I get what I'm looking for, which is that feeling.  It happens right below your neck.  It starts, like, in your throat and it stops above your pube.  It's a thickness.  It's a heaviness.  My therapist told me that your soul is sad.  Anxiety, no?  It's like sadness.  Anxiety attack?  No, no, no.  It's not an anxiety.  But it can be.  It's like that feeling.  Like, it's just sadness. 
[03:58:00]  It's like you have a weight.  Do you know the feeling you get when someone dies that you know?  It's a tangible feeling.  It's more than just an emotion.  It's a physical, like, you're feeling this.  Especially when they die in front of you with your cum on their face.  Right.  Last words.  And you don't have to pay small cock.  What did you do to me?  And you don't have to pay her.  But it's that type of, like, physical feeling.  Yeah.  Do you know what you get? 
[03:58:30]  My therapist told me.  And again, I just started, like, a month ago.  I'm so glad I went back.  Again, it was inspired by my girlfriend.  I started to go because we were talking one time.  She goes, why?  I feel like you're always mad at me.  Like, what the fuck?  Why?  Who said that?  My girlfriend did.  I thought you said you were a therapist.  No, no.  I had this anger.  I had this fucking anger.  Why are you mad at me?  It was so long, man.  It was fucking...  The anger was wrecking my body.  Jimmy, you've been holding your feelings back.  Why are you...  Dr. Melfi.  Fucking, uh...  My therapist told me,  you're just trying to feel something.  Because I live in a fantasy world, man. 
[03:59:00]  I never realized how much I fantasize.  And so I'll hang out with my girlfriend.  And I will actually mime a conversation to myself in my head with her right there about  what I'm going to have with her.  And she catches me moving my lips.  Holy shit.  Dude, fucking Bob Kelly yelled at me one time.  What the fuck are you doing?  You're nuts.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  He goes, you're fucking talking to yourself.  You're with me.  Oh, my God.  And he was right.  And I told her that.  And she loves fat Bob for doing that.  That's a bad example. 
[03:59:30]  I'd rather talk to myself than to Bob.  Of course.  Yeah.  But I'll fantasize that I'm talking to my girlfriend about something while she's sitting  right there.  And she caught me again yesterday.  I'm too embarrassed to admit what it is.  That's fucking fascinating.  You can't face reality, which is she's sitting there and she's there for you.  You can't.  I want to dissect him.  You're making a fucking.  You're making another situation inside the same room where she's fucking with you and  you don't deserve it.  My therapist said you just want to feel something.  It really is amazing.  That's amazing.  But you want to feel something, there's plenty to feel.  You've got a great girlfriend. 
[04:00:00]  But you don't.  How about feeling happiness or love and fucking excitement and. . .  But the fact that you're suffering this shit might mean you're working through it.  It's like people that say pain is the feeling of weakness leading your body.  Pain is the touchstone of all spiritual progress.  That's not what I said.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I was trying to make it sound like a dummy didn't say it.  What did you say?  You know, pain equals joy eventually.  No, no, no.  My fucking therapist said to me, what did she say, man? 
[04:00:30]  She said die of age.  Small dick fucking cunt.  Worst patient I ever had.  No, we were talking.  Really, doctor?  Is that your prognosis?  Oh, shit.  No, my therapist said to me, she goes, as I'm talking to you, I have no sense of who you are.  Wow.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  But no, no, she's really sharp.  She's like, I'm listening to you talk, and I'm telling her the truth.  I have no sense of what makes you tick. 
[04:01:00]  It's almost like the sexual stuff is so distracting, and I use it to constantly distract and focus away from myself.  It's fucking lunacy, man.  I'm trying to figure out if I know Jimmy, now that you've said that.  I don't know.  Like, the therapist, it's only been a couple of weeks, right?  So it would kind of be hard to, you know, figure out a person in a couple of weeks.  But now I'm trying to figure if I, like, know you more than just we sit here and do a show, and then, you know, an occasional phone call and stuff.  Do I really, like, know what you're all about?  And I don't really think I do. 
[04:01:30]  Because it is a lot of the, like, that bizarre sexual behavior and this weird thing that you're talking about now with the relationships and stuff.  So it's like, I've got to get to know you a little better.  I'm a good guy.  You like Starbucks coffee.  I know you.  That's what I know.  He likes Black Sabbath.  I know the way he takes his guy.  I know he's a Sabbath and stuff.  You know facts.  But this is more that I've learned more about you during this one little conversation than all the years I've known you. 
[04:02:00]  Well, yeah.  Because it's giving a little more insight into who you are.  He likes warm dubs on his chest.  No, no, no.  Never a warm one.  It's always a solid.  Although, boy, I'm not going to go any farther than this detail.  I'm very optimistic for you, Jimmy.  I did remember recently when I was very, very young that I was smelling somebody's shit in an abandoned house.  Somebody taking a shit.  All right, this is it.  This is it.  This is it.  There was this one thing that's unbelievably. 
[04:02:30]  I have a very vague, weird memory of leaning over and smelling somebody.  I mean, again, I was as young as you can be because I remember the abandoned house in Edison.  We used to hang out in where I found my first pornographic pictures.  And I just remembered to the day.  They were someone's shit.  They were of himself.  Somebody's shit.  It might have been my own.  I, honest to God, don't remember.  But it's not.  Wow.  If it was mine or somebody else's.  One of my earliest memories.  Dude, I don't know.  It was on a giant cock.  Right.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't remember. 
[04:03:00]  It wasn't sexual and I didn't see anybody's shit.  I don't remember.  But this is an actual event that happened?  Yeah.  I just remember smelling it.  Oh, wow.  And not like an animal in a weird way.  Like, I don't know why I did it or what it did for me.  One of my earliest memories was being in Mexico City at my grandmother's house.  And it's a huge Christmas dinner and I'm in the bathroom.  So there's just voices of like 20, 30 people in the other room.  And I thought that, you know, I was a little boy.  I thought boys pee standing up and poop sitting down. 
[04:03:30]  So I'm pissing and I have to shit too.  And I'm standing there and I just shit on the floor.  And so instead of, I got to clean it up.  But instead of like picking it, taking toilet paper, like picking up the shit, I'm going to  try to wipe it up.  So I just smear it fucking all over the floor and the wall.  Stupid kids.  I'm like a fucking Irish like famine, you know, guy, hunger strike dude, just shit all  over my face, all over the toilet and the walls.  And then my uncle walked in and said, oh my God. 
[04:04:00]  Jerked off on you.  My memory is that he washed my hands and said, I'll take care of this and let me alone.  But part of me wonders if one day that's going to snap into what really happened, which  is he rubbed his dick in the shit and made me suck it off or whatever.  You've covered it into this, you were shitting, they were outside thing.  Yeah, exactly.  There are times you figure you got to think, you're like, wait a minute, am I remembering  this accurately?  Yeah.  Like I was young, this, that, that.  Am I editing out many mouth fucks? 
[04:04:30]  Yeah, what the fuck?  That's following the story.  Do we help you?  Yeah.  I mean, I just don't know.  Or just talking out, help yourself there?  I don't know.  I don't know if it helped or hurt.  It's the truth though.  It's just what it is.  Jimmy's happier lately.  I am much happier.  That's another thing I know about Jimmy.  Much happier.  Much.  Yeah.  I feel much better.  My act is improving.  So get, get rid of that happiness.  Nah, I can't.  What are you doing with it?  It makes you act better.  Cause I was fucking gonna, gonna, gonna just obsessively work yesterday.  It's the last gas battle of this shit cunts inside of your body.  Yeah.  You're right.  That's all it is.  It makes you act better.  Do you have like a big, uh, foamy Muppet puppet now that you use up there? 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  His name is Saddy.  Saddy.  Saddy.  Get a Saddy.  Hey, this is Louis C.K.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthem.  You hear about Hitler getting his head knocked off?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Some, uh, some dude, uh, didn't like Hitler too much, so he went to that wax museum.  Oh, right.  Madame Tussauds.  Sure.  And just, just knocked Hitler's head off.  Knocked his block off. 
[04:05:30]  What, to rock him, sock him, Hitler?  It was the second guy into the exhibit.  The second guy.  He was a Berlin cop.  Wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  I, I know you're, you're going to give us the details, but I have a problem with the fact  that they didn't kind of hide Hitler's wax figure maybe deep into the, into the museum.  He's the second one you see?  No, no.  The, the person who took the head off is the second guy who was in the exhibit.  Oh, okay.  The second guy to see the Hitler figure.  Oh, okay.  Because he ran all the way to the back where the exhibit was. 
[04:06:00]  All right, I would assume you would hide Hitler.  Okay, I'm all right.  Thank God, because they had this thing set up where they were supposed to do, where Hitler  has a little thing and it goes, kapow, and then it says, congratulations, you're the  six millionth customer.  So thank God they ended that quickly.  Oh, my God.  He knocked his head off.  Yeah, clear off.  He had Hitler in a headlock and the guards were coming and he twisted and just separated  the head.  But you know what?  But that's, wow.  That's not a fair fight.  No.  No.  Hitler's not moving too well these days, so. 
[04:06:30]  No.  How could he do that?  Boo, you beat up wax Hitler.  Wow.  Gee.  Wow, very brave.  And they actually, the German, the museum had put, they have this really weird thing in  Germany where they, of course they vilify Hitler, but almost to the point of like ridiculousness  where they don't acknowledge him as a historical figure, which he was.  Yeah, yeah.  No matter what.  He's an animal.  Yeah.  But they got mad at the movie Downfall, which was a great film and it portrayed Hitler like  they showed the personal side of him, which you can't hide that.  He was a person. 
[04:07:00]  I mean, the fact that he was a human being who had love and who had affection for his  dog.  It's more frightening than ever.  It's more frightening that he was able, because we like to pretend that we have no connection  to these people who are such barbarians.  But yeah, that is a guy who could have been somebody you knew.  Yeah, you want him as some kind of monster that is completely unrelatable.  But yeah, when, you know, he's got to put his little dog Goldie down with that little  poison pill.  He felt a little bad.  And that said Hitler.  And that brought a little tear to your eye, right?  You know, I was watching. 
[04:07:30]  I just kind of felt bad.  That's not too outrageous, by the way.  You walk around New York City and you realize, you know, people love their dogs way more  than actual people.  So, yeah.  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony show.  Mr. Spock is a creep.  He photographs naked fatos.  Get him back on the phone.  Oh, Christ.  That's fantastic.  What a weird guy.  I'm not Spock.  Get that fat bitch.  Get him all to dance in a circle and I'll snap it.  What's his book called?  Babar the Elephant?  These are a fucking bunch of ugly fat chicks taking him black and white. 
[04:08:00]  How about you show harpoons?  Oh, that's fantastic.  What the fuck is lettered up to?  I don't know.  He really liked that episode, that movie where they had to bring the whales back.  It's something stuck with him.  Holy shit.  Spock.  Mr. Spock.  Spock, why the fat chicks?  Spock, I want you to stop with fat brawn.  Spock, I'm up-hauled by the fat chicks. 
[04:08:30]  What about, um...  Oh, we should have asked him.  Well...  You like the news?  I don't enjoy Leonard's books at all.  Why not?  Well, they all seem to be lacking something.  Look at the beauty of the female body there.  Although there is a lot of the person there,  they do seem to be lacking something that I enjoy.  I like them fat, too.  Only they're called cocks.  Oh, come on.  Oh, my. 
[04:09:00]  I'm laughing at the nude women.  Why is there nothing between their legs?  It's silly.  There should be something there.  No, that's a wonderful thing.  I'll bend over, and you play photon torpedo,  and I'll play target.  I like the fact that we act like gay guys  don't know what a vagina is.  Like, gay guys don't see a pussy  and know that it's not just a missing dick.  My God, that's a deformity.  It's funny that way, though. 
[04:09:30]  Where did your cock go?  Like, they only think cock exists.  Like, we understand the whole world around us.  We like pussy, but I like the fact  that with gay guys, everything is cock.  Where's your hat?  Is it shaped like a cock?  The balls can cover my ears.  It's like they don't have anything  but cock on their minds.  Yes!  Like everything, like a hot dog,  they can't eat it,  they have to suck it and sit on it.  Regular guys can eat a taco 
[04:10:00]  without licking it like a pussy,  but if a gay guy has a corn dog,  shove it in my asshole,  it looks like a cock.  No, but there's no words  that they can't look at as words.  Hey, you want to play baseball?  Only if there's two of them on my nose  and a bat across my face,  cock and balls, cock and balls,  balls and cock.  Jesus Christ.  What's that?  That's a hole in a person.  No, it's a vagina, gay guy.  I didn't know that.  You're so right, though.  Oh, damn.  Oh, we awful.  But it's like we don't, 
[04:10:30]  like a gay guy doesn't know what tits are.  Hell, what are those big things  on that man with no penis?  Why is that man with no penis  pushing a baby at where his penis should be?  Holy shit.  God damn, we are complete assholes, then.  You are absolutely right.  Oh, the gays are fed up with us.  Wow.  Wowie kazowie.  We never got out of junior high school  when it comes to that shit.  Hey, how long did we have Leonard for?  How long did we talk to him for?  A long time.  10, 12 minutes.  10?  10? 
[04:11:00]  Okay.  We got twice the time as everybody else.  Did the publicist chime in or no?  Oh, okay.  We could have kept talking  until we were just running out of steam.  No, he was done with us.  Oh, no, I know.  He was...  My favorite moment was...  That's what I could tell he was done.  Everyone's asking if I wanted  to blow up the interview.  I had nothing.  I had nothing.  Anthony was funny when he went...  I had nothing.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  I had to.  That was really funny.  I just had to.  I had nothing.  I had nothing.  You think George Sakai  talks into a phone  or does he just talk into a cock and balls  and yell,  hello, hello,  I'm Kay. 
[04:11:30]  I don't know what a phone is.  It's... </pre>
