<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with Opie, Anthony (suffering from a cold), and Jim Norton complaining about workplace pressure regarding sick days.  They then launch into a detailed recounting of their WrestleMania experience at the Meadowlands, describing their early escape from the event as leaving a "POW camp" and their surprisingly fast drive home.  They analyze various matches and wrestlers, praising Jericho's entrance and CM Punk's match, while criticizing Puff Daddy's performance, the lack of a ring announcer, and the Fandango storyline ending.  They share anecdotes about backstage encounters with wrestlers like Mick Foley, Ric Flair, the Iron Sheik (including humorous bathroom stories involving Flair and the Sheik), and discuss the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, noting the overwhelmingly negative New York crowd reaction to non-wrestlers like Donald Trump and Maria Menounos, contrasting this with the positive reception of Bob Backlund's speech and subsequent unusual behavior.  Their WrestleMania discussion includes criticism of the main event's perceived lack of excitement.

Guest E-Rock joins the conversation, sharing his own WrestleMania experiences, including poor seating and observations about the wrestling matches. He recounts receiving compliments on his work and a humorous incident involving acquiring a CM Punk t-shirt. The conversation veers into E-Rock's unsettling urination dreams involving Sam and Kenny, the Rutgers basketball coach scandal, the HBO show *Vice* (specifically an episode depicting graphic aftermaths of bombings in Afghanistan), Margaret Thatcher's death, and the upcoming Louisville vs. Michigan basketball game.

The show then shifts to crude jokes about Margaret Thatcher's sexuality and aging, followed by an unsuccessful attempt to find images of an 87-year-old woman's genitalia online. This transitions into a discussion of the hosts' messy homes and personal hygiene, featuring graphic descriptions of bodily functions and cleaning habits.

A segment reviewing "Scorch's PFG TV" follows, mocking the show's low budget, poor set design, the host's persona, awkward interviews, fake audience reactions, outlandish stories, and bizarre contests (like punching human statues). The review includes mentions of guests Scott Young, Steve Sweeney, and Sarah Lakita.  Death Wish Coffee is also briefly discussed, interspersed with off-color jokes.

A subsequent "Scorch's PFG TV" segment focuses on Sibby's disastrous video submission – an interminable shot of a Caribbean road – leading to extreme frustration and ridicule from the hosts, punctuated by technical difficulties. Studio guests Steve Sweeney and Sarah Lakita (Scott Young was also scheduled) are present.  The interview with Sweeney is uncomfortable, his stand-up routine interrupted and his jokes frequently cut short. The conversation touches on Sweeney's career, depression, and a supposed encounter with a veterinarian. The segment ends with criticism of Sibby's video.

Following Scorch's segment, the show discusses gifts given to Opie (a completed Sudoku puzzle and John Cena merchandise), leading to a discussion of E-Rock's actions and the staff's dynamics and perceived motivations.

The final segment focuses on a conflict between associate producer Sal and senior producer Eric regarding Sal's perceived reluctance to relay messages to interns.  Troy and Travis offer their perspectives. The hosts debate the justification of Sal's complaints and the workplace power dynamics. Listener calls, many siding with Eric, are included.  The conversation includes humorous moments, WrestleMania references, a caller's anecdote about a comedian's poor performance, and jokes about Sal's background.  The segment concludes with speculation about future conflicts and a *Lord of the Flies* analogy. A caller who won a prize package also makes a guest appearance.  The show ends with further discussion of the segment and the hosts preparing to leave. Offensive language and crude humor are prevalent throughout the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio, Antonio, New York City, 6 a.m., an out of control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans at the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be. Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic. Hey, hi. And Jim Norton, a comedian. It's me. I work here. Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live now? Is it happening? This is it? 
[00:00:30]  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  I'm telling you what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level. 
[00:01:00]  And sand.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, good morning, everyone.  Hola.  E, e, e, e, e.  All right.  Ooh.  Good morning, Anthony. 
[00:01:30]  All right.  Well, don't expect much out of me today.  Like every day.  I have such a bad cold.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  This is so bad.  It feels like there's a pair of jackals trying to get out of my face.  Yeah.  It's like it's just itchy and pushing sinuses.  And coughing. 
[00:02:00]  You don't sound good.  It's terrible.  But I came in because I had taken off Friday.  And perished to thought I took off today.  I would have gotten a phone call guaranteed from Bob.  Anthony, hi.  It's Bob.  Give me a call.  We got to talk.  Yes.  Steve Blatter said that you weren't in today.  They are weird about sick days.  Yeah.  Even though the main guy gets to take every other week off.  If we're sick.  I remember being sick recently. 
[00:02:30]  And I was up to two days in a row.  I took off.  And then I was getting the calls like, they're kind of wondering when you're going to, you know, get back in there.  And I said, well, how about when I feel better than I do right now?  Fuckers, man.  Why are they wondering when I'm coming back from being sick?  Yeah.  I'll tell you when.  When I feel better.  How about that?  Because I'm a fucking disaster right now.  My throat is fucking everything.  Everything.  If they get mad, fuck them?  No.  No.  That's just it.  If they get mad, fuck them. 
[00:03:00]  No.  Because then you get this fucking, there's a pissed mist around the room when they're in.  Oh, boy.  And you see them next time and fucking.  Oh, boy.  You really, you really, you still care.  That's weird.  Yeah.  You got to get to my point.  Yeah.  Yeah, just fucking do it.  I would, if I was you, I would get up and leave right now.  Yeah.  I really would.  Believe me.  I'm not putting up with any of this shit anymore.  The amount of live shows we do, it's unbelievable.  It's crazy.  There's not another show around here that does more live shows than us. 
[00:03:30]  They never fucking get that shit.  They never get to the point, you know, like the other day when Louis C.K. was in.  It's great.  I love fucking Louis and stuff.  And that's why we stayed, you know, it was a good fucking half.  We're more than a half hour late.  Oh, I don't know.  It was great.  Louis fucking great.  Right.  We went to a quarter of.  Yeah, a quarter of.  But they just, that just goes away.  Yeah.  They never fucking consider that.  No, that, the other side of it always goes away.  Ugh.  We tried to sneak out once.  I forget. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, remember that?  Time stands still around here.  But we tried to sneak out.  I think it was Friday.  Remember that?  And I really do believe it was one of those weeks where we did go an extra hour here and  there and a few minutes late here.  And we probably, you know, we probably did easily an hour and a half extra radio that  week.  So on Friday, we're like, you know what?  It's 945.  We did everything we could do.  We certainly could just go on the air and just babble about nothing just to get to 10  o'clock.  But why don't we start our weekend nice? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, let's take a hike.  Told the guys, just throw something in there.  Oh, my God.  They looked at that as sneaking out.  Yeah, yeah.  And they met us at the elevator and berated me.  I got berated on that.  Somehow you skated.  You snuck out before we got to the elevator.  Oh, I fucking ran.  Yeah, I know.  It was like we were trying to get out of a fucking POW camp.  And they're fucking, they're fucking kind of like yelling at me.  And I got right in their face.  I'm like, what the fuck's wrong with you?  You know how much extra time we do that we've never asked, asked for for back or whatever 
[00:05:00]  you want to say?  Unbelievable.  They just so.  Yeah.  Well, that's why you missed WrestleMania, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  Because me and Jimmy had two fucking wide open seats right to our right.  You're faking.  Believe.  I had to deal with Edgar all day yesterday.  I know.  Isn't it great?  Well, I felt really awkward because other people, they talk to Edgar like he's a real 
[00:05:30]  person.  Right.  I don't know how to do that.  No.  Like Jonathan does it.  Kenny does it.  His ex-girlfriend does it.  Like, oh, Edgar.  Does it because she still does it.  And Jimmy's doing as Edgar and I'm like, I don't know how to talk to him as Edgar.  Yeah.  I tried once and it was so awkward.  I felt myself eating off.  I'm like, this isn't going to work.  It is awkward.  Yeah.  Because he wants you to talk to him as the character.  I know that.  So.  I was actually going to take the two tickets and like plant them somewhere and then tweet 
[00:06:00]  where they were.  Oh, you should have.  No, but then I was worried about what kind of fucking assholes you'd be saddled with.  And then I started thinking it would be great if I could just give them to fucking somebody  that's really terrible and know that.  Yes.  Who's Bobo?  I don't know this guy.  He's the guy who had his Twitter fucking taken over over the weekend.  Really?  Like somebody.  But he was on.  Right.  He was logged in.  Right.  At the same time, the person that had his account password was logged in. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  You could be logged in from two different locations and post from two different locations.  Right.  On Twitter.  So he was arguing with himself and just by reading him, you could tell which one was  Bobo and which one was the hacker.  Yeah, it was pretty funny.  I don't really know Bobo.  No, I know people talk about him for me from time to time.  Yeah, but we had empty seats at WrestleMania.  So I told Jimmy, you got to take a picture and text it to Roland.  Roland was dying to go.  Because Roland was bothering all of us for a ticket. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, sorry.  And I finally got a babysitter last minute because I thought I wasn't going to be able  to go.  I couldn't have gone if you did.  I'm having car issues.  Yeah, because then Jimmy, he writes me, he's like, you're driving.  I'm like, yeah, I just found out that I got a babysitter.  I'm in.  So we went to WrestleMania at the Meadowlands.  What did I miss?  Not much.  What?  You missed, what did you miss?  That's a really good question.  You missed like really cool entrances. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  By fucking animals.  Yeah.  And that's about it.  Great production.  A great stage set.  Amazing production.  Like they, wrestling really knows how to make a show and a spectacle.  Yes.  And.  Just create an energy.  Yes.  I don't know.  I, there's a few things I found really strange and maybe Sam can help me out.  There's no ring announcer anymore.  I didn't know that.  You serious?  They had the blonde broad.  She, she came out in the beginning and then that was it.  She, she didn't, there was no ring announcements. 
[00:08:00]  What are you talking about?  There was a guy in there at one point I saw.  You can hardly see him just standing there.  But there was nothing like we're used to UFC announcements where.  Right.  Two combatants are there.  Right.  And then the announcement happened.  And they used to announce them as they were coming out.  Yeah, they did.  They announced them.  Not where, we didn't hear shit.  As they were coming out.  Like they don't announce them with the two in the ring at the same time.  Why don't they do that?  No, we, no.  They didn't announce them.  I'm holding to this.  No, they were saying their names.  When?  Yeah, before they came out. 
[00:08:30]  Before the music.  You would see it lit up and then the girl, the girl would say it or the guy would say it.  I heard a bunch of the names, but I would see them first.  But there was no definitive, like what Bruce, I don't know UFC is different, but Bruce Buffer  makes the announcement and then the match starts.  Right.  I didn't like the way wrestling started the matches where I felt like it would feel more  like combat if they actually stood there and announced each one and let them, I don't  know, I kind of wish they.  They saved that.  Huh?  Like for when they really want to do like a big fight feel.  Right.  Then they'll do it that way.  Did they do that for The Rock and John Cena? 
[00:09:00]  I don't think they did this time.  We wouldn't know.  We wouldn't know.  You abandoned ship?  Oh boy, did we.  Yeah.  Oh boy, did we.  All of a sudden, like I was feeling out.  Jimmy, Jimmy was feeling me out.  And I think at the same time we went, you want out of here?  And we both went, yes.  And we left in the middle of the Brock Lesnar match, which was the second to last match.  When we entered the parking lot, like I'm used to going to sporting events where, yeah, 
[00:09:30]  I'm that guy, I'll leave a little early or a concert.  Yeah, I'll leave a little early.  And you'll see other assholes in the parking lot going to their cars.  When me and Jimmy hit the parking lot, I swear to you, we were the only people in the entire  parking lot or at least our section.  Jordan, we jumped in my car and we were the only car leaving the Meadowlands.  The only car.  I mean, I wish I wanted to film it because in the rear view mirror you see a lit up stadium  and a packed parking lot and we're the only car leaving. 
[00:10:00]  I Twittered a photo of the stadium from across the street.  It doesn't really tell the tale, no.  It didn't do it justice, I've got to be honest with you.  Well, that's the match no one would leave.  Of course not.  We could pretty much see our apartments from the Meadowlands because of the New York City  skyline.  There were times that ride could take two hours.  It took, am I lying?  No.  Less than 15 minutes.  Yeah, less than 15 minutes.  Maybe 14 minutes.  I was out of the thing in my lobby.  I couldn't believe it. 
[00:10:30]  It was like leaving here.  Wow.  How was it getting there?  Did you get there early enough?  Yeah, we did all right.  Well, I tell you, I did a fucking power move.  Jimmy wasn't all in on my power move at first, but I went for it.  It was the GW instead of the fucking Lincoln.  I went power move.  I'm like, I'm telling you, these guys took me to a Springsteen show on a Friday during  rush hour.  We left and they did the power move to the GWB and went, you know, the roundabout way.  Right.  And it fucking worked for us.  Much faster. 
[00:11:00]  It took us less than an hour.  We hit traffic when we got into the venue.  Like, just getting into the locker room, like, all right, you can't avoid it there.  We made it 15 minutes there, but that was nothing.  For an 85,000 person fucking event, we got nothing.  But we left.  We're like, who gives a fuck?  And then my Twitter exploded.  They're like, you're leaving before The Rock?  I'm like, yeah, we are.  Yeah, you're not even leaving.  Like, you said when I saw you there, you were at least going to wait until The Rock and  John Cena made their entrance.  We wanted to see the entrance.  It was that tag team match first. 
[00:11:30]  Because the entrance thing is pretty fun, man.  They scrapped the tag match.  Oh, they did.  I didn't know that.  They were running out of time, right?  Somebody went long, yeah.  Somebody went long.  Oh.  I wish I would have known.  How long was Brock's match?  I don't know.  20 minutes?  We probably should have.  We didn't know, though.  Because we thought there was going to be a tag match in between Brock and The Rock.  So I was like, I don't want to sit through another one.  I was cold.  It was fun, though.  I did enjoy it.  It was cold?  Wait.  Fuck, I forgot about that.  It's outdoors.  Yeah.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't freezing, but I was starting to get, like, fucking cold. 
[00:12:00]  We had our winter hats on.  We tweeted a picture with our winter hats on.  Who won?  Brock Lesnar or Triple H?  Triple H won.  Oh, so Brock doesn't get Stephanie McMahon?  No.  Well, that wasn't an actual.  Oh, I thought it was.  Because then he said the loser gets Stephanie.  Which made me laugh.  Heyman's video straight on.  Why would you put your wife on the line like that?  There are a few things I wish that they did differently.  Because I think it would make it feel more like I like it to feel.  But I did enjoy it.  Like, I loved Jericho's entrance. 
[00:12:30]  It was fucking amazing.  I thought Fandango's entrance was fun.  Yeah.  They blew up the Fandango angle, which was strange to me.  That's it, huh?  No more?  That was our seats, by the way.  You got to move to phase two.  That was my seat.  And if you go to, I am going to promote my Twitter right now, Opie Radio.  I got a picture of E-Rock online getting food.  That was great.  Did you see the picture yet of E-Rock?  I was scared after I tweeted it.  Because E-Rock couldn't have been nicer to us yesterday.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  E-Rock.  Who was he supposed to be?  I think he was going for Dusty Rhodes, right?  Oh, yeah.  American Dream.  I was hoping he was going for the Hulk, because, you know, E-Rock loves Hulk.  But E-Rock could have been nicer, making sure we're set up.  He bought little things for my kid.  And, you know, he went to our seats to see how we're doing.  The new little paychecks?  And then I'm tweeting this.  I'm like, why am I doing this?  He couldn't have been nicer yesterday.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, but you wanted to have a laugh.  A little laugh.  You wanted to have a laugh.  You wanted to laugh.  I think they...  I don't like the way you just hear, doom, just the bell starts, and then they start wrestling.  I guess, though, for TV, you hear it, and it's a different vibe.  Yeah, there's commentators, like...  Yeah, for TV, they do an amazing job.  The commentators fill in all the fucking dead spots.  Yeah, it seems like if you're really kind of into it, being home and watching it seems  to be, like, the thing to do.  I don't know why they can't figure out how to, like, have some setup where if you're, 
[00:14:00]  you know, at the Meadowlands, you can listen to the broadcast.  I don't know why they haven't figured that shit out yet.  For even sporting events.  I mean, some sporting...  Well, I guess they do.  UFC, I think they do it.  They do.  That's what I...  I guess that's right, man.  Other sports, like the UFC and stuff, they don't.  They did a thing for a while where they were selling radios at the merch booth.  Right.  You could tap into the frequency and listen to the commentary.  Yeah, that would be cool, I think.  I mean, I don't know.  It obviously didn't work because they stopped doing it, but... 
[00:14:30]  There's probably a delay or something.  Yeah, there might be some kind of delay in a moment like that, which is...  Oh, we went off tangent here.  Oh, whatever.  I'm a little tired, too, from yesterday.  Yeah, they blew up the Fandango angle because his whole angle was he wouldn't wrestle until  someone got his name right, and all of a sudden he had his pretty cool entrance, and  then they made sure Chris Jericho had a way better entrance, which I thought was hilarious.  He had a jacket that lit up, fireworks, all sorts of shit after Fandango's big entrance.  And then they just started fighting. 
[00:15:00]  I'm like, that's how they're going to end the bit, where he doesn't fight until someone  says his name right?  They move on to Phase 2 now.  I guess.  What is Phase 2?  Whatever it is.  But I thought there could have been a little better ending to that.  Yeah, like one Fandango.  One weird moment that was lost.  One last Fandango.  But with WrestleMania, I do know they don't do any of that nonsense.  It's all about the build-up, and then they get the fighting in right away.  They do, right?  Yeah, they don't play around on Mike at all.  Yeah, and you've got to show him.  I mean, he's got to wrestle.  No, no, but I figured they would show him.  No, I understand he had to wrestle, but it was such a great bit to me, I just thought they 
[00:15:30]  would have had a little better ending.  Is there no Mike stuff?  I noticed no one got on Mike.  Rarely with WrestleMania.  It's all about, all right, we've been shit-talking for the last, whatever, few months, and we get  in there and fight now.  Time to TCB.  That's right.  I'll say that the fucking, the entrance for The Undertaker was really awesome.  No one beats that ever.  That's a great, great sports entrance.  The Undertaker.  I leaned into Jimmy, I'm like, can you imagine?  85,000 people, and you just take your fucking time to the ring. 
[00:16:00]  How that has to feel as a performer.  He was just lollygagging, traipsing slowly to the ring.  He's been doing that for what, 25 years, right?  21 WrestleManias.  Crazy.  Yeah, but yeah, since 1990, so.  1990?  He started?  Yeah.  His match and CM Punk's match was, fuck, it was great.  I mean, that was a really, really entertaining match.  I told you, man.  Mike, when you got two wrestlers in the ring that really know what the fuck they're doing,  that's what it's all about.  That was the show stealer.  Yeah, because.  You think so?  Yeah, I mean, that was a classic. 
[00:16:30]  Like, that was by far the best match on the show.  And that table was supposed to break, you were telling us?  Oh, yeah, when he dropped the elbow from the top onto the table.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Fucking leg hit it.  That looked painful.  Oh, man, someone got a dead leg.  Yeah, that's supposed to collapse and break your fall a little bit.  I didn't at all.  And Daniel's wrestling was a little sloppy, but I mean, you know, he had to wrestle for  the first time for the WWE in a huge fucking spot.  Yeah.  And remember I told you he was going to win in just, like, a cheap way?  Yeah.  I thought he won fair, like, in the sense that he pinned him. 
[00:17:00]  I mean, it was.  Yeah, but he just small packaged him out of nowhere.  We could give these to Roland.  Oh.  Oh, he's got this.  Oh, no.  And my two.  Roland probably would have got out to your place to get those.  He probably would have taken a train just to get them.  Oh, that's terrible.  He was talking about it on Friday.  I came back here.  And he was already like, do you think they're going to go?  Do you think?  If they're not going to go, do you think?  Should I ask for their tickets?  I want to go.  Oh, God.  Roland asked me, and I told him I just don't know. 
[00:17:30]  And.  Yeah, I didn't know either.  I didn't think Ope was going to go.  Ope was setting up, like, last Tuesday, like, I don't know if I'm going to babysit.  I'm like, I don't think he's going to make it.  I wasn't hearing from Ant.  I'm like, I'm not driving because I'm going to get this weird fucking thing on my car where  it shows the picture of the Lyft.  Too much oil is coming out or something.  So I'm like, I'm not going to overheat in the fucking Lincoln Tunnel or in a parking  lot with 90,000 people.  But Ope surprised me.  It went.  So I'm like, I want to go.  Yeah.  And we got out of there nice and early.  I was probably asleep before the rock match was over. 
[00:18:00]  I swear.  Oh, without a doubt.  I was in bed.  I was.  Yeah, I got into my apartment.  I said hi to the family.  And I was out within five minutes.  Horrible.  It's horrible.  What time were we home?  10, 15?  Yeah, 10, 15, maybe.  And we left, I think, like, barely 10 o'clock.  The rock match ended, I think, at, like, 1040.  Oh, yeah.  I was definitely sleeping by that.  Yeah, they're going under curfew.  They're not stupid.  I was definitely sleeping by that.  That's horrible.  A couple other things. 
[00:18:30]  Could someone explain why they had Puff Daddy?  I know they try to go for celebrities and stuff, but Puff Daddy?  Yeah, instead of having the tag team match that people might have wanted.  That was bad, dude.  I don't know.  I could see it living color because that was CM Punk's walk-out music, right?  What did Puff Daddy do?  Yeah, and it wasn't, like, an interruption of the show.  It was the introduction, yeah.  All of a sudden, Puff Daddy just, I don't know.  P.J.D.?  Puff Daddy?  Was that the unofficial halftime?  What was that?  They like to have a performer out there.  Yeah, I understand that.  And I guess that was the song.  But why did they pick Puff Daddy?  I'm sure there was a bunch of people that would have taken that spot. 
[00:19:00]  Because Vince McMahon is in his 60s.  Out of touch a little bit?  I mean...  And then Puff Daddy's getting nothing, and then he starts talking about the hurricane.  He's, like, using the hurricane to hype up his own shit.  What?  Was anybody into him on the floor?  No.  No!  I didn't think so.  They didn't boo him.  They tolerated it.  They were just kind of there.  And he knew that as a performer.  So then he starts mentioning, like, you know, we're coming back from Hurricane Sandy.  Like, he was using anything he could.  He's saying, you know, cheer for Cena, cheer for The Rock, anything to get more energy.  Try to get fucking... 
[00:19:30]  But he's a pro, though, so he kind of...  I'd say that for him.  He's a lot better than Kanye, who fucking Kanye just thinks that he's such a genius.  And nobody's reacting to him, and he doesn't seem to care.  Right.  He doesn't address the fact...  At least fucking Diddy knows how to work a crowd a little bit and didn't do too much time.  He's had catchy songs over the years, but I'm so over Diddy.  Did he get a better reaction than Jimmy did in Philly when he said...  What was that one?  I must confess.  Oh.  It was me in a monkey mask. 
[00:20:00]  That was great.  Just assuming that everyone listens to us.  I was eager back then.  I was hopeful.  That was fucking cool.  I wish we could have interacted with some of the wrestlers upstairs, because I did Artie's  show Friday night to promote Caroline's this week, and X-Pac was the guest after me.  And I heard he was in the green room in the back, not the regular green room, but the back.  So I walk in the back to talk to him, and it's him, and our pal Cowhead was there, and Justin 
[00:20:30]  and Eric Stengel, I guess, were there at Cowhead.  So I hung up with those guys for like 45 minutes.  Nice.  And what a fun guest he would be.  He was a fun guy to talk to, man.  Yeah, he had stories.  He talked about his asshole getting ripped open.  Did he?  Yeah.  We had a fucking ball.  Is he still in town?  Let's get him on today.  He might be.  I think he was leaving today.  Yeah.  Because Cowhead was doing his show live today.  You talking about China?  No, he mentioned a big click thing.  Oh, yeah.  He's probably way over there.  He's like, yeah.  He looks like there's another young lady.  But he will talk about it.  So Puff Daddy performed, I guess. 
[00:21:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, it was a total, like, everybody started going to the bathroom and getting food and getting  merch.  Yeah.  And then a little later, they had Living Color as old fat guys.  Yeah, they do.  I remember, what's his name?  Corey, the lead singer?  I guess.  I remember seeing him back in the day.  He's a big lover.  He'd be ripped with no shirt on.  Oh, God.  Now he had, like, old man clothes on.  White hair.  White hair.  But I think he dyes it, like, blonde because maybe it went white. 
[00:21:30]  I don't know.  He was in a platoon.  Yes.  Yeah.  And then once again, I leaned over to Jimmy and said, somewhere, black girl has a massive  fucking hard on.  Oh, yeah.  We gonna get a hi, hi.  Oh, God.  They didn't look like that.  No, huh?  We're seeing a picture of Living Color from back in the day.  I mean, I think they go back to the lady.  They go back to the 80s, I believe.  Yes, they do.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but they sounded great.  They just basically did punk's intro, which was good. 
[00:22:00]  But then again, I mean, if they can't sound great doing cult of personality, they should  be out of the fucking business.  Yeah.  You know, we're all gonna get sick, and fuck it.  I wish they wouldn't give you shit if you're not yours.  I'm sorry.  I'm not mad at you.  Believe me, that's what I was thinking, too.  That's what I was thinking, too.  Are you still contagious?  I don't know.  I can't afford to get sick.  I have girls to put my penis in.  That a boy, Jimmy.  That a boy.  I was thinking the same thing.  It's like, you know, I don't wanna...  I know we give E-Rock shit when he comes in sick, and it's like, what are you doing?  You're gonna get everyone sick?  And then it's like... 
[00:22:30]  But I'm fucking sitting there, getting an ulcer at home, thinking about the shit I'm  gonna have to fucking take from these cocksuckers down the fucking hall.  You ought to go and just sit in Scott's office and talk to Blatter and Gary.  Make a stop.  Do what they want you to do today.  Make a pit stop at every office.  Yeah.  Shake hands.  How about we have a meeting today in your small fucking unventilated office?  Fucking A, man.  And that goddamn fuck shit...  What is that shit called?  That fucking emergency? 
[00:23:00]  You know when emergency works?  When you weren't gonna get sick anyway.  What a great gimmick they have.  No.  Let me tell you what their gimmick is.  Let me tell you what their fucking gimmick is.  They say, you gotta take it before you get sick.  Right.  How brilliant is that?  How brilliant is it?  Because then if you're not getting sick...  Right.  If you're not gonna get sick and never were gonna get sick, you go, wow, it worked.  With that said, can we get some emergency in here?  No, use Colby's.  I hate emergency.  I use Colby's.  I love emergency.  Nice blast of the vitamin C.  Oh, boy. 
[00:23:30]  I would be mad that I wasn't using the cough button.  Oh, he would not be happy.  So, let me call her.  Fucking sounded great.  Doing CM Punk's.  That's his entrance music?  Yeah, yeah.  Is that all they did?  Oh, they did Cult of Personality.  Cult of Personality.  I love that.  Open letter to a landlord is a good song, too.  You do like that, right?  Yeah, that's a good one.  And after that, whatever.  Can I tell you, Brock walking down that fucking...  Brock is a big kid, man.  He's an animal.  Whoa, is he fucking big?  Yeah.  And I guess this is just better for his health. 
[00:24:00]  Wrestling is a little easier on the body.  And he only does it three times a year.  And it looks like he got a lot bigger since fighting in the UFC.  Because I think you've got to stay a little trimmer and leaner for the UFC.  Oh, you have to.  He looked like he bulked way up since the UFC.  Yeah, he's bulked.  And he was big in the UFC.  You never have to make weight.  You don't have to worry about your diet.  And Sam was telling me, I didn't know this, that The Undertaker only wrestles once a year.  I had no idea.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just does WrestleMania.  But he did show up recently on a SmackDown or a Raw, right?  Just to kind of hype WrestleMania? 
[00:24:30]  He does like the last few Raws before WrestleMania.  But he doesn't wrestle?  He doesn't wrestle.  And then WrestleMania.  What?  There's a little clip of it.  Oh, well, that's it.  That's all they show.  And they buried it in the paper today, too.  Sam, I was surprised to hear that Sam has not met The Undertaker.  He has not gotten a photo or an interview with The Undertaker.  And then fucking Sam steps on the elevator the other day with The Undertaker.  Yeah, you've got to ask him at that point.  You have to.  I was late to the Hall of Fame, but we went in and there's the garden. 
[00:25:00]  And we went into the employee entrance, because that's where the media credentials were.  And I get in, and as I'm getting my credential, this giant dude with a hat on  walked right by me, and I turned around, and The Undertaker was right in front of me  waiting for the elevator.  And I can't believe you didn't just take a quick picture, because there's no one there.  It was in the elevator.  He would have taken it.  It wasn't a lot of fans around.  Yeah.  No, it was just me and him and his wife and a dude and a kid in a wheelchair.  Dude, you should have snapped that fucking hall back and snapped that picture with your iPhone.  Fuck yeah. 
[00:25:30]  That's crazy not to.  And then you interview him, you get a better one.  But a flash of the moment like that?  And I bet you he's not bothered by the whole thing as much anymore, because he's only out there  every once in a while.  No, he was totally cool.  And the guy in the elevator was like, 21-0, and The Undertaker was like, yeah, buddy.  Yeah, he won.  So he's now 21-0.  Spoiler.  Which means he'll have to wrestle next year again.  Yeah.  Wow.  And he only, once a year, he's that hurt, or is he that old, or is it a combo of both?  Because he still has amazing heat, considering he's only out there a few times a year now. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, it's a matter of keeping himself in the best shape possible.  Like, over this year, he had, I think, knee and shoulder surgery, both.  So it's like, you can't work a regular schedule like that.  You might as well do the main fucking...  Just make sure you're in excellent shape for one match, as opposed to being in okay shape  for like...  Let's see if Sam knows.  Sam will probably know.  Who's the first guy you beat in WrestleMania at like six or seven? 
[00:26:30]  Superfly at WrestleMania at seven.  Yeah, I think Sam would know that.  Okay, brother.  He's beat Superfly, he's beat fucking...  I looked over his thing, Shawn Michaels a couple of times.  But he never wrestled Hogan.  Not at Mania, but he didn't.  So I guess he was doing at those Manias too, right?  At those WrestleManias?  Hogan?  Yeah.  Yeah, he had a couple of them.  He didn't do a lot of them?  Hogan?  Well, I mean, he was done by...  He was done early on.  ...RustleMania 9.  Yeah, that's early.  And then he didn't come back until...  Yeah, 18.  Would they have liked Hogan there yesterday?  Yeah, if Hogan came back for WrestleMania, if he goes back in a WWF ring... 
[00:27:00]  I'm worried.  They'll love him?  Yeah, they will.  And it looks like they got rid of a lot of the nonsense.  Like, you know, ladder matches and cage matches and all those type of, like, kind of gimmicky matches.  So save that for Hell in a Cell.  Yeah.  I mean, they do...  But what they do now is they kind of...  They try to position pay-per-views around the gimmicks.  So, like, WrestleMania sells itself.  Yeah.  But if they want to do a Hell in a Cell match, they'll do...  The pay-per-view would be Hell in a Cell.  You know what I mean?  Gotcha.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  So, like, they don't need to add that to WrestleMania.  Man, if...  Oh, sorry.  Your phone, Anthony.  If you weren't following the Iron Sheik over the weekend, you were fucking missing out on some of the greatest tweets...  Oh, I missed out, unfortunately.  ...on some of the greatest tweets and fucking Vine videos I've ever seen.  He makes Vine videos?  Oh, God, they're fucking great.  They're short.  Really?  Six seconds of complete and utter lunacy.  Do you know...  He's crazy.  I was asked to roast him.  Really?  But I couldn't because I was taping live at Gotham.  I'd already committed to a live at Gotham. 
[00:28:00]  I wish I could have roasted him.  And then he talks about the Jews and stuff.  Like, he's...  But I guess everyone knows he's just a nut, so...  The Brock have the booger in the nose.  Hashtag WrestleMania.  He was talking about Triple H and Brock Lesnar.  He writes,  Hell of a match, and fuck the Hulk Hogan.  Yeah, fuck the Hulk...  He said Hulk Hogan and his Rice Krispie dick.  He's like, it's fucking great.  But he doesn't, uh...  He doesn't do the thing anymore in person. 
[00:28:30]  What thing?  Like, we can't have him in here.  Well, I know why.  Why?  Because he doesn't do the deal anymore.  He doesn't do the gimmick.  Like, he doesn't get angry.  He doesn't yell.  Why?  He doesn't come and sit and chat.  I'd rather just talk to him.  Yeah, why doesn't he do anything anymore?  What happened?  He's not in good health.  No.  He looked good on his Vine videos.  He looked healthy.  Give me a Vine video.  I'm looking for him.  Oh, God.  Yeah, he, um...  I'm not into the Vine video thing.  It's so weird.  All right.  It's because I have...  Will Sasso is the only one I've seen that's doing, like, a thematic thing. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  He just does some gimmicky thing, and then a lemon flies out of his mouth.  I don't know.  I've seen a montage of it.  It's not bad.  He does some pretty funny things.  But for the most part...  Sticky.  Boogie, baby.  Sticky, baby.  Boogie.  Sticky.  Boogie, baby.  Sticky, baby.  Boogie.  Sticky.  Boogie, baby.  Sticky, baby.  I don't know. 
[00:29:30]  Right?  I don't know what he's doing.  All right.  He's crazy.  Good.  So Will Sasso's got a lemon.  I've heard it.  I've seen one of his videos.  Yeah.  I haven't watched all of them.  I watched a montage, and it's kind of funny to watch in montage format.  Man, cheers.  It's not even a montage.  It's all of them.  What else about WrestleMania?  CM Punk, Undertaker was your favorite match.  Yeah, those guys really know how to work it.  Yeah, they do.  That's why I was explaining to Jimmy.  Because some of the other matches were kind of lame, to be honest with you. 
[00:30:00]  What was lame?  I don't know.  I liked the fucking...  I didn't care about the tag team as much, but again, I didn't care about the heavyweight  championship.  Oh, Dolph Ziggler's match?  I mean, no, the other one with...  The big show, that was the triple threat of an opener.  Those were fine, but it just wasn't like I didn't have any investment in them.  I didn't care.  You just know when the guys really know their shit and know what they're doing in the ring.  It's so obvious.  They could really work it and get that energy going in the plays.  Iraq said the main event stunk.  Iraq?  What?  Iraq, you've been gone for four days and you haven't talked about WrestleMania yet. 
[00:30:30]  Hi.  Give me your thoughts on this whole fucking thing.  Yeah, I said to you guys, you picked the right time to leave because I thought the last  match was really boring.  It wasn't boring at all.  The crowd was like...  He said the crowd wasn't into it.  The crowd was completely into it.  There was false finish after false finish.  I heard silence.  That's what Iraq said.  There was silence at certain points.  There was boring chants at a lot of other points.  Really?  They chanted boring?  Well, here's what happened.  The crowd died because Triple H won against Brock Lesnar. 
[00:31:00]  Was that bad?  Yeah, everybody was like, what?  Why?  Again?  People are tired of seeing Triple H win because they think, obviously...  He just wins because he's the son-in-law?  Yeah, I mean, you know...  So the wrestler's kind of like, you know, secretly not like him because...  It's not that secret for a lot of them.  He pretty much slept his way to the top.  There's a lot of them.  Triple H slept his way to the top.  According to Scorch, Scorch introduced him to wrestling.  Introduced him to the WWF at the time, and now, of course, the WWE. 
[00:31:30]  And now he's married to the boss's daughter.  So you've got to think of other wrestlers.  And we love Triple H, and he'll be in here again.  But I'm thinking a lot of the other wrestlers look at him and kind of roll their eyes a little bit.  A lot of them.  Although he works his ass off.  He does.  He's a great wrestler.  So wait.  So Triple H...  He shouldn't have won.  They would have rather seen Brock win, I think.  And it's more believable that Brock wins because of his UFC fighting.  Like, you know that Brock's a fucking savage.  And I think it's more valuable.  I mean, if they're paying Brock Lesnar a ton of money for individual matches, 
[00:32:00]  he shouldn't be losing because he's been back for three...  He's done three matches in the last year, and he's lost two.  So it's like how...  That's Vince.  Vince is still mad that he left for the UFC.  So he just paid him a ton of money.  And he's like, oh, you're going to lose it again.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because he's a billionaire.  Yeah.  You don't care about the money in the end.  He's just doing it for fun.  Yeah.  He's holding a grudge because fucking Brock left for the UFC.  I'm telling you.  Because he's probably paying Brock Lesnar like a million dollars a match. 
[00:32:30]  No way.  How much do you think the Rock made?  Probably over a million dollars for the match.  Okay, so you got Brock loses.  Easily a million.  Yeah.  I would get a few million.  He wouldn't even step into the fucking arena for less than a couple of million.  You told me that.  He's making fucking righteous bucks making movies.  Why is he going to risk his movie career?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So wait, Brock loses, and you said the crowd just died?  Yeah, the crowd died.  They were like, all right already?  Yeah, because people...  Brock should have won the match. 
[00:33:00]  Um, and people hate John Cena, and they don't...  Like, the Rock is, like, a little bit stale.  People like him, but he's, you know...  They know, first of all, he's not going to go out there and give his fucking all.  The Rock made it?  And maybe, yeah.  That's the thing.  And maybe fuck himself up and miss out on his 30 million dollars for a fucking action movie.  He's got to be careful.  Why the hell would he want to risk that?  So he's not going to be doing anything crazy.  Like, once you get past the excitement of, oh, the Rock is back, you're like, okay, he's back,  but he's part-time.  Oh, wait, who won? 
[00:33:30]  Uh, Cena won.  Uh, that was so obvious he was going to win.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, he should have won.  Is he boring though?  Because the Rock's not...  Huh?  He's just boring, Cena.  I don't know.  He doesn't...  I mean, he's the hottest guy in the company.  Is he really?  Looks-wise, you mean?  Yeah, he's just really good-looking.  That's all my whole thing.  See, I don't know anything about him.  Like, is he really the one people like Sean Cena?  He's the biggest star in the company.  He looks like a...  Is he?  By far.  Wow.  He looks like a pumped-up Mark Wahlberg.  Yeah, he does.  But he's like...  There's nobody even close to him. 
[00:34:00]  But they did a really good...  He's bigger than CM Punk?  Yeah.  Can we talk about how we left nice and early?  Does that bother you?  They did a really good series to end the match, is what I was getting at.  What do you mean?  Like, it started like...  I don't care about the technical stuff.  That's for you and your wrestling keep friends.  And they got...  People got excited at the end of the match.  Yeah, good for them.  It was like false finishes and stuff, and you know, it was fun.  I just can't...  It's hard for me, and again, it's not to...  So when you watch wrestling, you're like, you see CM Punk jumping off that top thing onto a table.  You can't fake that.  Like, you're jumping onto a table from 12 feet in the fucking 20 feet in the air. 
[00:34:30]  Especially when it doesn't break.  Yeah, you bounce off it.  So these guys are punishing their bodies.  But I guess I've just gotten so used to the...  It's harder for me to get psyched about it, because I know that they're not...  You know...  Well, it's a whole different world.  It's a different world.  Yeah, they're entertaining you, you know.  It's performance.  Yeah, they're...  That hurts a lot.  But yeah, I mean, it's insane that...  I don't understand why you would leave early, the whole point in going...  Because my sleep is very important to me.  I didn't care about the Rock John Cena. 
[00:35:00]  I mean, I don't...  But you didn't even watch the end of the Brock Lesnar match.  Nah, I didn't care about that.  We kind of knew what was going to happen, I guess.  No, you didn't.  I liked those guys, but...  Yeah, we kind of knew.  Yeah, you had no idea.  We had a few.  Once you see him in the ring, it's like, yeah, that's pretty much it.  The walk down was fun.  The entrances...  Wrestling does...  The entrance is right.  I was just as satisfied as when E-Rock came in and I asked who won the match.  I was like, oh, okay.  Now I'm completely satisfied.  Yeah, but you're also the type of guy who leaves...  Who, you know, goes all the way to Philly for a Pro Jam concert and then leaves early  and misses the Jay-Z surprise thing. 
[00:35:30]  But I saw enough.  And then you go, oh, but I got home early.  I saw 95% of the concert.  I do like a good getting out of the...  But you feel like you accomplished something.  One thing good about the Yankees this year?  No crowd after the ninth.  Oops.  Great.  It's smooth fucking sailing to get out of Yankee Stadium.  I'll stay for a good football game.  I'll leave...  I'll definitely leave a basketball game early.  I'll definitely leave a hockey game early.  And I'll definitely leave a concert early.  Really?  The big encore?  I pretty much will leave everything early. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, like concerts, the best part is the end because they save the best parts...  Is it?  ...till the end.  And like a wrestling show, they put the main event at the end.  So.  The best part of the show is not the middle of it.  I had a really good time, and I'm not bothered by it in the least.  I love getting out.  You feel like you accomplished something.  Oh, yeah.  You're right at the parking lot by the main road of a stadium, and you pull out onto the  highway, and you're like, I'm out, motherfucker.  I am not lying.  We were the only car on the road. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Until you hit that other fucking road that leads to the tunnel traffic.  I was back up in the box for the last match.  Right.  Until the end of that match, every seat was full.  Well, except for two.  Honestly, probably only two.  There was no...  I'm telling you, there was no one else out in the parking lot.  I could see the whole audience, and every chair had a head on it.  Yeah.  It was people.  It was mobbed.  Yeah.  Look, I got to see the fireworks.  I got to see the 21-0 Undertaker thing.  I got to see Fandango. 
[00:37:00]  You didn't get to see Bob Backlund take the stage?  No.  When did he?  Right after the Triple H match.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  I thought they...  What did they do?  They had the Hall of Famers?  Yeah, they introduced the Hall of Fame class.  I was kind of hoping to see that.  Who was...  Who did they bring out there?  Mick Foley, Bob Backlund, Bruno Sammartino.  Tiger Sheik.  I think Donald Trump.  Why did Donald Trump have to be out there?  Why is he...  The celebrity wing.  Does anybody care about him in wrestling?  The celebrity wing.  The Hall of Fame thing was hilarious because...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:37:30]  I got this.  Trust me.  And we're going to go there.  Good for you.  I just remember something else.  Yeah.  You got to go and hang out with the family and friends?  Yeah.  And you were telling me some stories from up there.  You got to tell them on the air.  Mick Foley was looking for a seat, and no one would give up their seat.  Yeah.  Mick Foley's at a WrestleMania in the Friends and Family box, and you would think he would  have a seat.  Well, I got lucky because, as it turns out, I decided to go with Friends and Family, but  that box and the press box were like the same box. 
[00:38:00]  It was just there were some areas that the press couldn't get into, so just extra access  for me.  But the Friends and Family box, so many people were there that they had no seats, so you  couldn't look out the window, because all the seats were full by the time we got there.  Thank God I had a press seat, like right next to the Friends, so I had a seat.  I thought you didn't give up for Mick Foley?  That's my point.  Yeah, what a fan you are.  You should have given Mick Foley a seat.  I mean, that would have went a long way.  There was an exchange between Sam Roberts and Mick Foley. 
[00:38:30]  He needed a couple seats.  And he asked Sam.  And Jess was with me.  Yes, Sam.  And so I'm not going to make Jess stand.  Oh my God.  He didn't ask if he could have Sam's seat, but he said it in a way like, help a brother  out.  You know, I said hi to him and everything.  He goes, Sam, you're a guy.  You've got connections around here.  You know where I can get a seat?  How does Mick Foley not have a fucking seat?  Dude, you walk in.  He's made WrestleMania over the years.  It's crazy.  There's another, there's a whole like eating area, like a cafeteria area that wasn't looking 
[00:39:00]  out on the stadium.  It was looking out on the other side, but it had TVs in it.  And so this giant room where people were watching the show, not live, but on TV.  Ric Flair, Mick Foley, Axaw, me and Gene Okerlund, Sika the Wild Samoan, everybody you  could think of.  But we couldn't get up there.  I tried to get you guys wristbands.  But they were sitting in just a room watching it on TV.  Yeah.  That's weird to me.  What was Ric Flair doing there, for the love of God? 
[00:39:30]  Drinking.  Was he?  He just lost his son a week ago.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  But he wasn't doing it.  I didn't mention that to him.  I said hello to him.  Oh, you didn't.  How did he look?  He looked like the nature boy.  I'm going to take the face, this guy.  He looked like the nature boy.  Just having a good time.  He looked like he was having a good time.  He was smiling.  He was saying hi.  I didn't hear any woos, but a lot of...  Why wouldn't he...  Any chest smash things?  Knife-edged chops.  Knife-edged chops.  Why wouldn't he take a WrestleMania off?  He just lost his son.  He was at the Hall of Fame on Saturday, and then he showed up at... 
[00:40:00]  And he was chilling in the box.  I got to...  I went and pissed.  That's what his son's doing, too.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Wow.  What?  Chilling in the box.  I went and pissed when Diddy came out, obviously.  Yeah.  And I was pissing, and the urinal next to me was the Iron Sheik, and then the urinal next  to him was Ric Flair.  How big are their cocks?  I didn't look.  How'd you not look?  I didn't look.  Why did the Sheik need a urinal?  Usually his pants are...  Good enough.  ...dandy.  But there was a backup walking into the bathroom, because the Sheik needed quite a bit of help 
[00:40:30]  getting out of his wheelchair.  Really?  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Oh, he's really getting old, though.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  And he wasn't doing his shtick.  No, he doesn't do his shtick.  Do you have his curly shoes?  Yes.  Curly shoes?  No, he had sneakers.  Wait, so if he's not doing his shtick, what kind of guy is he?  He's just like, okay, nice to see you, guy.  Just really nice and just mellow?  Yeah.  That's so weird.  Yeah.  Super mellow. 
[00:41:00]  He might be on pain meds or something if his knees are bad.  Really bad.  It's hard to be angry when you're on pain meds.  Right.  Hulk's here.  Hi.  Hey.  Yeah.  So, anyway, now to the Hall of Fame.  The Hall of Fame was so funny, because they decided to do it in New York.  And New York fans are animals.  Uh-huh.  And so, like, it was...  Where was it at?  It was at the Garden.  Madison Square Garden?  Yeah, it was sold out.  Jeez.  Wait, the regular MSG?  Yes, not the theater.  They filled MSG?  They sold out Madison Square Garden. 
[00:41:30]  Just for a Hall of Fame event?  Just for speeches.  Holy fuck.  How many people is that?  17,000, 16,000.  Yeah, and they did the floor.  It was like a concert.  So, if they did the floor, too, that's close to 20,000 people.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  There were a lot of people there.  Wow.  And, uh...  But they're New York fans.  So, like, the tickets say, like, you know, business attire is requested for this event,  and blah, blah, blah.  And there were some people who...  I didn't...  Yeah.  But there were some people who actually showed up in business attire and everything.  But, you know, the guys come out, and they're trying to give these speeches to, like, you 
[00:42:00]  know, encapsulate their careers and everything.  But every time they showed John Cena on the screen, or, like, Bob Backlund came out, and  he was like, you know, like, one guy who's doing a great job is John Cena.  Boo!  You suck!  Boo!  The whole place boos him.  Maria Menounos from Extra, she came out to induct Bob Backlund, because I guess they're  friends.  They're not friends.  Oh, come on.  And she could not... 
[00:42:30]  It was the most...  I hope when they air it on Tuesday that they don't fuck around with the sound, because  she couldn't get a word out.  From the time they introduced her name, she got pelted with boos.  No matter what she said, it was the whole crowd booing her off the stage.  She started...  And she wouldn't shorten her speech.  She started going over, like, Bob Backlund facts that people may not know, and just got the  boring chants the whole time. 
[00:43:00]  You could tell looking at her face that she had never had to deal with this type of reaction  on this level, like this rejection.  Did he do the knee walk?  No, he didn't do the knee walk.  I would have fucking knee walked all over that cock-sucking place, up every step.  And then Trump came out.  Anybody who wasn't a wrestler...  Got booed.  Booed off the stage.  Did they boo Trump?  They booed the shit out of Trump.  Why wouldn't they?  I don't know what he's doing there.  You know, sometimes I tell people, you're fired.  They booed Trump's wife.  Of course.  Trump introduced my beautiful wife, Melania. 
[00:43:30]  Boo!  Well, nobody wants to hear from a guy who's not a wrestler.  I don't blame them.  He's always been part of the WrestleMania thing, but still...  He has been, but come on.  That's funny.  Yeah, it was great.  Did they boo Backlund?  No, Backlund actually came out, and he had the speech of the night.  He's nutty, right?  Do we have it here?  What's this?  We don't have this speech because it hasn't aired on TV yet.  Right.  But, because he starts doing his Bob Backlund thing where he's just low-key, and he's like,  you know, you've got to make sure that whatever you do, you just never give up.  And he starts looking around, and he goes, you never give up. 
[00:44:00]  You never give up!  You never give up!  Why?  And he starts shouting, and he's moving his arms around, and he's walking back and forth  on the stage, and he's cutting...  He's going between speech and promo, back and forth, speech to promo, speech to promo.  Did people enjoy it?  Yeah, he killed it.  Really?  They loved it.  And then after, like, as everybody's leaving the Hall of Fame, like, they're playing this  nice music, and everybody's in their suits, and everybody's waving, Bob Backlund just  jumps off the stage and runs into the crowd, and starts running through everybody, and his  arms are waving the whole time. 
[00:44:30]  Wait, would he do the arm run?  Were his arms weird when he ran?  Yeah.  What was that?  I don't know.  It's called being an asshole.  Can you find a video of Bob Backlund running the old Bob Backlund?  I forget that he's just, like, the arms up.  So what do we got here for the people, Sam?  This is what they aired on the website.  It's just a quick interview he did after being inducted.  Right.  And I only pulled it because Jim always says that he used to love Bob Backlund's bland,  uninteresting, no-excitement promo.  Because he would breathe, like, well, Vince, you know, I just want to go out and have 
[00:45:00]  a good match.  And I think that, you know, if we both wrestle really hard, I'm going to have a good shot  at winning and maintaining the title.  And that's exactly what he did for the website.  WWE ring announcer Lillian Garcia tweeted that you were blowing the roof off of Madison Square  Garden with your speech.  What do you say to that?  That's what I came here to do.  I told myself that I was going to do that three years ago.  That's how long I've been working and coming here.  That's how long I've been dreaming about this situation, to have things set up that I have 
[00:45:30]  with the WVU right now.  Like, I meant what I said.  You never give up.  There was great emotion and great passion in your speech.  And when you took us through your journey to the Hall of Fame, it was really deep and  meaningful.  What stands out to you about the moments you spent out there on that stage?  The thing that stood out the most is how the people listened so intently and how they  were very into what I was saying.  Because Booker T did a bang-up job entertaining you. 
[00:46:00]  And I knew I was going to have a tough time following you.  But you people were great.  And he had just been shouting at the top of his lungs.  Bob Backlund's a psychopath.  Yeah.  He's a psycho.  I just saw a tweet from Fandango.  He just writes, he tweeted, who can't wrestle?  And then hashtag undefeated.  Undefeated.  That's funny.  All right. 
[00:46:30]  So there you go.  I didn't like my seats at all.  Why not?  I didn't like the wrestling.  Your problem with your seats was the wrestling.  I wanted Hulk Hagen.  He just kept saying he wanted to go home.  And then I don't know how to talk to him with Edgar.  From the minute we got there, Edgar was like, I want to go home.  I know, because I got a text from him, I guess, when he wasn't talking to you.  Yeah.  That said he wanted to go home.  Yeah, that's what I kept saying.  I wanted Sam to take, Edgar wanted Sam to take him home in the middle of a match.  Drive me home. 
[00:47:00]  Drive me home.  I was going to Jimmy's stay, because I really thought we were going for an hour.  I really thought, and I drove, so I would have no choice.  I thought Jimmy was like, all right, enough of this.  But we did good, man.  I'm so glad I didn't go.  No, it was fun.  No, you know why?  Because I just know I'd have been sick and cold outside.  It wasn't that bad.  No?  It really wasn't that bad.  You had to dress appropriately.  I grabbed my winter coat and my hat as I left, even though it was a really nice day in New York yesterday. 
[00:47:30]  But as soon as the sun went down, man, it got fucking cold.  Yeah, when we went down to see the Punk Undertaker match and the entrance and stuff, I was just kind of surprised that you guys were still there.  Really?  I wasn't sure if you guys were still there.  I was definitely staying for The Undertaker.  I knew that.  Just because I know just how great his entrances are.  It was so crazy going down on the floor.  That entrance was unbelievable.  Yeah, he's always had a great entrance.  Enough about the entrance!  But it was so weird being up in that box because I didn't even want to watch the show. 
[00:48:00]  I just wanted to wander around and look.  We were cranking up people around us because we kept going, what is the ref looking at?  We were just commenting like the whole thing was real and we didn't understand.  And then Jimmy says, imagine in the UFC if the fighter held the other guy's head before he punched him.  They always touch the head where they're going to punch it.  They'll touch the head and then stomp and punch.  And I'm like, if they did that in the UFC, it would be very awkward to have Jones holding the guy's head and punch you where he just touched.  We were talking like the whole thing was real and people around us were laughing pretty hard because it was just ridiculous. 
[00:48:30]  Like if The Undertaker had such beef with CM Punk and Paul Heyman's got the urn and stuff, why would you go in there and have a legitimate wrestling match?  Yeah, it would be a fight.  Wouldn't you just beat the living shit out of him and finally...  And wouldn't the Athletic Commission have a problem with fire coming out of the fucking ring posts?  Hazardous?  You're saying that...  We had New Jersey SWAT guys right next to us, basically.  And when the fire hit, I wanted to tap the guy on the shoulder and go, I think there's a fire thing happening here. 
[00:49:00]  You might want to check out.  You don't know why after a two count, you don't think they should be looking up and looking at the audience exasperated?  No.  That's what I said.  I'm like, why would you get right back into it?  Like when the ref hits the third one and they roll off anyway, but they don't call the match because that's not what it's supposed to end.  And both of the performers just sit there looking at the crowd.  It's like, why is nobody going after this?  But you got the wrestler all week, so you only got the two count.  Why wouldn't you get right back in and try for the three count again?  Right. 
[00:49:30]  It's exasperated.  And you got to understand, the frustration starts to set in.  And these wrestlers think to themselves, what do I have to do to beat this guy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll tell you.  CM Punk really knows how to work it.  Chris Jericho really knows how to work it.  Yep.  And Triple H really knows how to work it.  Undertaker, obviously.  Not obviously.  His entrance is amazing.  I thought he was good, though.  He's good.  He's one of the best of all time.  He's good.  But I think those guys blow him away.  They really know how to work a match.  Is he a Hall of Famer? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  The Undertaker will go into the Hall of Fame.  Chris Jericho really knows how to work a match.  That's why he was the one in there with Finn Dango.  And CM Punk really knows.  Because you don't even care that CM Punk isn't all, I'll just say, roided out.  But, you know, he doesn't have that, like, over-the-top fucking, you know, monster body.  But no one cares because he's so damn good in there.  I would assume that Dolph Ziggler is pissed off.  Because Dolph Ziggler is a guy who's really good in the ring.  And so he's like, I'm going to go out there and steal the show.  And he's in the tag team match and they gave him five minutes.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  It's like he didn't, like, they wouldn't give him any time.  Right.  Like, he's one part of a tag team match and they only gave the match five minutes.  Oh, really?  You know?  Look at the people on the fucking bill.  There were some big people on the bill.  Yeah, I guess.  But you wipe out P. Diddy and all of a sudden you got an extra 10, 12 minutes.  Yeah, but who we couldn't have danced with that?  I don't know why.  I like to dance with people.  Someone's got to explain why P. Diddy was doing it.  Why?  I'll tell you why.  Here's why.  They needed a little music, I guess.  No.  Same reason they had in Living Color.  There's very few black wrestlers.  No, in Living Color made sense.  They wanted more black faces there because there's very few black wrestlers. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, I mean, that's why they have a Latin heavyweight champion.  Because they want everybody to kind of have a guy to root for.  With the black guys, there was Mark Hunt.  Mark Henry.  Mark Henry, whatever.  And who else?  Like, there's not many.  They'd probably credit The Rock.  What was the crowd?  Oh, yeah, The Rock.  I forgot.  It was the crowd mostly.  Very mixed.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Wrestling hits every...  More white people, but I mean, they have a very mixed crowd.  Do they?  Oh, yeah.  I would think it's just white trash.  I'm teasing, of course.  Very mixed. 
[00:51:30]  I had very uncomfortable dreams last night.  Oh, can we say that for after the break?  Yeah, I mean, really, really weird.  Really?  Involving Sam and Kenny.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Weird.  Weird.  I can't wait to hear this.  E-Rock, any thoughts?  You were gone for four days.  You gave us 30 seconds on WrestleMania.  Well, Sam was covering it all.  Yeah, but he's...  Oh, dude, you know what the funniest thing was?  The whole weekend, like, literally...  Because I went to the WrestleMania store right after we were done with Radio Row on Friday.  So, like, from the time the broadcast was over, I was doing wrestling stuff. 
[00:52:00]  And, like, and seeing fans and stuff the whole time.  The whole weekend, people were coming up to me and being like,  Hey, Sam, you're doing a great job this weekend.  Oh, thanks.  Hey, is E-Rock a big help?  The whole weekend.  Yeah, I love those tweets, too.  People were asking me what a big helper E-Rock was.  I felt bad.  He was a big help.  Were there any sweatshirts there?  I wanted to get a sweatshirt.  Yeah, there were sweatshirts.  It was sold out when I got there.  Yeah, we didn't see sweatshirts.  A lot of stuff got $300 a piece for sweatshirts. 
[00:52:30]  Do you still want one?  Well, it depends.  I want to see them first, yeah.  Jimmy bought stuff that he'll never wear.  What did you buy?  Did you buy merch?  I bought two shirts.  I bought a Paul Heyman.  I'm with Paul Heyman, whatever shirt, with the red hand.  I'm a Paul Heyman guy.  Whatever.  But I liked it because Paul didn't think I liked him.  And that one, and I got a CM Punk Undertaker shirt, which was like black and gray, which  is actually a cool shirt.  It's exclusive.  Is it?  Oh, wow.  That's exciting.  And I didn't see any Jericho shirts.  But Jimmy's shopping, knowing he's never going to wear this stuff.  You went to the WrestleMania shop?  I did.  Yeah, you did.  And I went to the little outside one, and I'm like, where's the actual store? 
[00:53:00]  And guess what?  We had the whole WrestleMania store to ourselves.  I did.  Because that was just before the Rock match.  No, it was during the Brock Lesnar and Triple H match, so there was no one in there either.  You know how I got...  And when we got there, someone said there was an hour and a half wait just to get into  the store.  Yeah, I actually...  An hour and a half wait just to get into the store.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Was that true, E-Rock?  Yeah.  As soon as you get in, there was a huge line that was coiling around maybe twice before  you could even get near the store.  Not for me and Jimmy, man.  We walked in.  I mean, there might have been 10 other people shopping, maybe. 
[00:53:30]  I went in...  In this huge store.  If you're willing to miss the stuff everybody came for, you do really well.  You got to go against the fucking stream or whatever.  You're right, because when we left you guys after the Punk Undertaker match, I went into  the store because I was looking all over for the CM Punk t-shirt because it was sold  out everywhere, and I ran into some guy who was wearing it, and it was a medium, and  nobody had any mediums left, and the guy told me if I let his friend... 
[00:54:00]  He knew who I was, and he said, if you let my friend go on the after show, I'll give you  this t-shirt that I just bought.  And I was like, fuck yes.  Do you have to show us our time?  No, sorry, dude.  I needed the shirt.  Yeah, but you have to fucking run this by me and Ann and Jimmy.  I think we're vetoing that.  Yeah.  I mean, all right, I got the shirt.  I hope you have to give the shirt back, because we veto that.  How's he going to find me?  All right.  Well, thanks, E-Rock.  That's amazing. 
[00:54:30]  You really added a lot here.  E-Rock didn't even hang out, like...  He didn't hang out in the press box.  He didn't get to see the wrestlers.  E-Rock was making sure me and Jimmy were taken care of.  We ran into him at least three times, I think.  Yeah, but he was in a...  Once on the food line, he just found us.  There was free food.  Once at our...  No, he wasn't getting food.  He was just making sure we were all right.  Where was your free food?  Upstairs, in a box.  Oh, we wouldn't know that.  We wouldn't know.  Well, you asked for tickets late, too.  Plus, I was thinking about this.  We had all right seats.  You had good seats, especially for... 
[00:55:00]  We had no...  Not amazing seats.  And we didn't have the floor.  And we had no perks.  You had...  Hang on.  Although, E-Rock drove...  This is why I feel bad that I tweeted that picture.  E-Rock drove all the way into the city to give me a parking pass so me and Jimmy would  be taken care of.  E-Rock wanted to do that, though, because...  Knowing, like, it was a major fucking, you know, traffic problem yesterday because of  WrestleMania.  He asked me for my extra parking pass so he could give it to you.  Right.  Like, he wanted to make sure he was the one...  Well, if you had an extra parking pass, how come you didn't offer it to Opie? 
[00:55:30]  I was going to.  I literally...  That's a really good question, Jimmy.  Thank you.  When I got...  I mean, I texted you guys to let you know that E-Rock had my parking pass and that you  should have it.  But, um...  But you didn't drive all the way in the city to give it to us.  I wasn't going to.  But...  Actually, I would have because it was on the way for me.  But, uh...  But otherwise, I wouldn't have.  Um...  Jesus.  But, yeah, no, E-Rock didn't hang out with the wrestlers.  He...  He...  He wanted to make sure me and Jimmy were taken care of.  Right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  There you go.  But he sat somewhere else.  Why didn't you hang out with the wrestlers?  One, I didn't know the wrestlers would be in the press box. 
[00:56:00]  Uh-huh.  Because you were in the friends and family area.  I wouldn't have seen them anyway.  I wasn't in that section.  Yeah.  They were all over the place.  I saw a couple when I first got there.  I was in the elevator with a couple.  But, um...  I had a pass to a suite, so I sat on the other side.  All right.  Well, there you go.  When we get back, uh...  Jimmy's going to talk about his weird dream.  Nice.  Yeah.  I hear that.  I know the shit from the weekend.  And that was really uncomfortable.  We got a final college basketball game tonight.  The brackets are done. 
[00:56:30]  We got two left.  April Madness?  Got two left.  Mm-hmm.  Uh...  Let's see.  It's, uh...  That fucking...  That team with the guy with the busted leg.  Yeah.  Kevin Ware.  And?  Red Goose.  Louisville.  Yes.  And what?  Michigan.  Michigan.  That sucks.  I saw, like, the guys getting off a bus on TV.  Boy, they sure love them Beats. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, they all have their headphones.  Every single one of them got the Beats on.  And they're fucking...  All the basketball players.  And they're all just walking around.  And...  They'd probably get them for free.  And some of these guys, I guarantee you, were tatted up at 15.  Like, you just see these guys.  They're, like, freshmen.  And they're fucking just tats everywhere.  I bet you half the headphones didn't even have any Beats on.  It's just the look they have as they're, you know, getting off the bus, I think.  Them Beats. 
[00:57:30]  I would bet some of those guys had nothing going on.  They just had their headphones on.  That fucking Dr. Dre motherfucker, huh?  Yeah.  Making some fucking change.  Oh, wait, wait.  Not change.  What do we call it?  Guap.  Yep.  There you go.  Some of the guap.  I learned that from fucking...  A website.  No, who kid?  Oh, the who.  Yeah, you got some guap.  Guap.  Guap.  Guap, nigga.  You should wear your wrestling shirts to work.  I have to wash them first.  I have very, very delicate skin. 
[00:58:00]  They had a Bob Backlund shirt in that store.  I didn't see it.  Oh, you should have got that one.  Oh, that's what you should have got.  It was red.  So I don't know if you would have worn it.  Oh, yeah.  What, a red Backlund?  Because he was a redhead.  But I didn't see it, and...  You're going to be jealous when I wear mine.  No, I'll just throw paint on it.  Oh.  I have to wash them first.  I can never wear shirts without worshing them.  Worshing?  Really?  Yeah.  It gives you rash.  Oh, it itches.  I feel hot.  Shit makes you itch.  Dude, I feel like there's a hot, like...  Oh, wow, really?  ...over my skin. 
[00:58:30]  I have to really worship.  Amazing.  Girls can piss on you without any problem.  Well, that doesn't just bother my throat.  I don't waste it.  So you guys are all in now?  Are you going to watch Raw tonight?  I might, actually, just because, you know, it'll be the follow-up to WrestleMania.  I think we're done.  No, I'm going to do something Raw, but it's not watching wrestling.  But I can guarantee this.  This is a promise to the listeners.  We're not going to be talking about wrestling tomorrow.  See, the only reason we talked about wrestling this long was because WrestleMania was in our backyard.  That's what I was going to say. 
[00:59:00]  You guys had good seats because you asked last minute, and you spent 360 days of the year shitting on the product.  Yeah.  So, we don't shit on the product.  What are you talking about?  On wrestling?  Yeah, you say terrible things about wrestling.  Like what?  Dude, they said the Fandango.  They said as far as all the press they got leading up to WrestleMania, the biggest one was Fandango coming on our show.  That's kind of cool.  The Fandango thing was huge.  We don't shit on it.  We tease it, but, I mean, it's like we interviewed Jericho.  We have CM Punk.  We take care of all those guys. 
[00:59:30]  They come in fucking...  Triple H.  Foley.  Any of those guys that want to come here in the last year?  Yeah.  I would say we trashed them a lot.  Foley.  Yeah, we treat them nice.  Considering I love UFC, I'm pretty open-minded about it.  It's just not my thing, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  So, what are you going to do for the next fucking year?  Exactly.  Pucker Licker.  No, he's...  Are you going to watch Raw tonight?  He's all in for Raw tonight.  And then there's a pay-per-view, I'm sure, two weeks from now.  I think it's three weeks.  He's down every three weeks?  Yeah, I think there's...  I don't remember which one is in three weeks, but... 
[01:00:00]  The fucking...  The hat in the store match.  They all run in with derby hats.  They're trying to knock his hats off.  Had the hat rap match.  So, uh...  Who's fighting at Raw tonight?  I don't know.  The Rock will be on Raw.  Oh, really?  Talking about his loss?  Yeah, he's not going to wrestle, but...  Where's Raw tape?  Plug in G.I. Joe?  What's going to be at IZOD?  Did he plug G.I. Joe?  They're wrestling right next door again?  They just did it!  They don't want everyone traveling.  Yeah, they're getting, uh...  So they're going right to IZOD.  Why didn't you go there tonight?  I'm thinking about it. 
[01:00:30]  Wait, are there tickets available?  I doubt it.  I don't know.  Do you want to go?  No, I don't!  I'm busy!  I wouldn't be hugely surprised if they don't set up another Roxana match.  Another what?  Roxana match.  Well, yeah, because it's one and one.  Right.  So then it's the tiebreaker bullshit.  The Ali Frazier thing.  Right.  Just like Ali Frazier, right?  Kind of, yeah.  People are a little sick of that match, so I don't know if it'll work.  They're not going to do it.  So maybe they shouldn't wait for WrestleMania.  Maybe they get it out of the way nice.  How about tomorrow night?  And then let The Rock go back to making movies. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, really.  Who do you think people really want to see fucking wrestle?  John Cena against who?  CM Punk?  Would they like that?  If they had done a John Cena-CM Punk match, it would have been, yeah, it would have been big.  Have they fought?  Yeah, they've fought before, but their matches are excellent.  Is anybody undefeated wrestling or no?  No.  I mean, Fandango.  Brutus the Barber Beefcake?  He's not.  He's had several defeats.  Oh, is he wrestling?  No, no.  He's alive. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, wow.  Why wouldn't he be wrestling?  British Bulldog?  He's dead.  Oh.  Their program was very good.  I looked at the program.  I didn't buy it, but they had a Hall of Fame, and they had the regular WrestleMania one all  in one.  It's a massive program.  I smelled it.  $632.  Oh, see, that was actually cheaper than I thought.  I paid $8.50 for mine outside the store.  It was really well done, though.  They put together a good product.  Jimmy loves buying things.  I do.  I didn't buy the program.  It smelled good.  He just loves buying things.  They don't skimp on anything.  The Fan Fest was huge.  Yeah, they understand how to make a tremendous show.  We're still talking about wrestling. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  The production value is great.  Yeah.  The fucking arena looked great, the way they set it up.  I mean, they don't fuck around, and, you know, they just don't fuck around.  They know what they're doing.  Yeah.  You rock final thoughts on WrestleMania?  I'm good.  Do you have any snacks?  What did you eat there?  What did you eat there?  Because I ate bad last night.  No sort of...  What?  Nothing.  No moment, no, like...  I think you took, like, four days off for this thing.  Yeah.  To give us some content on the air. 
[01:02:30]  So far, you've given us none.  Right.  I mean, since you've been working here.  What was the funnest thing that happened for you last night?  Like, last night was, like, maybe the best live event experience I've ever had.  Really?  Wow.  Yeah.  What have your other ones been?  Wakes?  Well, it's because you had, like, some privileged areas you went into.  Just wandering around and looking at wrestlers, interacting.  And then wrestlers, like, being like, hey, what's up, dude?  Wow.  They know you.  Yeah, they all do.  Oh, that's crazy.  Is this a childhood dream for you? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, dude.  When the Miz is coming up to me, like, hey, there he is.  They know you.  Yeah.  Well, because someone probably said, where's there a homosexual?  Listen to that.  That's not what they said to the Miz.  I had a glove in my pocket at that UFC thing we went to, and I was backstage, and I was just  getting guys to sign it for myself, and I saw Frank Mir.  And he goes, hey!  I'm like, hey!  And then I asked him to sign, and he goes, oh, this guy's a fucking autograph.  I don't know what happened to Opie with the president, by the way.  That's right.  I was so embarrassed.  That's why I don't ask for any pictures anymore. 
[01:03:30]  You've got them all.  I don't have, there were guys there last night that I didn't have, but I didn't want  to, I wasn't going up to anybody asking for pictures last night.  You're in.  Now you're in.  You can't do that.  Yeah, you can.  I do.  I'm one of the guys.  I like having relationships with people.  When's the last time the Miz called you?  Here's your relationship.  There he is.  Yeah.  That's your relationship, so you get that picture.  But he's coming up and being like, hey, you know, and talking about the interview we  did and specifics.  You didn't get The Undertaker.  And he wrestled before the pay-per-view.  I know.  Two years ago, he headlined it. 
[01:04:00]  Headlined.  Headlined WrestleMania.  Two years ago, he was the headline.  This year, he was the pre-show.  Is that bad?  I mean, it's not good.  It's not to say it's not recoverable, but.  Wait.  Why was he the headliner?  Who did he wrestle two years ago?  Cena.  And Cena won?  No, he won.  Was it a good match?  It wasn't great.  Well, then why is he out of good graces?  We're still talking about wrestling.  I can't believe it.  I tried three times.  Let the record show that I tried three times. 
[01:04:30]  I noticed.  I did try.  Too fucking interesting, you know?  Well, not according to E-Rock.  He hasn't added anything.  I can't.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Come on.  I had a lot of fun running into different wrestlers at the event and other events this  weekend.  I saw Jake the Snake sitting at the bar at Outback.  And?  Wow.  What about the end?  He does weave a hell of a tail, doesn't he?  Yeah.  That's the setup.  And then there's always the end.  Because he doesn't have anything else because he fucking thrusts his face into a blooming 
[01:05:00]  onion.  Look at me.  I'm starving.  Yeah.  And then what'd you see?  Yeah.  So the bottom of the plate, completely clean like they just washed it.  Feed me.  Isn't that a slug line for one of the wrestlers?  Yeah.  That's Ryback.  Feed me more.  Feed me more.  Yeah.  Ryback was great.  You see him pick up Mark Henry like that?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  That was kind of cool.  He picked up that fucking big fat cell.  Started walking around with him on his shoulders.  I can do that.  Mark Henry's well over 400, right?  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Holy fuck.  Is this still wrestling?  I think so.  I don't know.  You try.  Because I obviously failed.  All right.  We don't even run our own show anymore.  What happened?  How about this?  Yes.  We'll be right back.  Ooh.  The O.B.M.D. Show. 
[01:06:00]  Does this have a theme, you think?  Huh?  You think this has an Iraq theme?  Yeah.  I'm trying to figure it out right now.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I got it.  Not bad.  Oh, wow.  Not fucking bad.  Dire Straits.  Oh, yeah.  I like this.  Salt of the swing, right?  Yeah.  Not bad.  Got to give Iraq some props today.  I like when he makes us think. 
[01:06:30]  Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home run record 39 years ago today.  The sultan of swing.  Oh, bravo.  I'll take that one.  All right.  You're not good at talking about wrestling, but you can pick a mean tune.  What?  Huh?  How can he not be good at talking about wrestling?  I don't know.  This is his shit.  He doesn't have a lot of shit.  Because even Jimmy asked me, you think this is Iraq's Super Bowl?  I'm like, yes.  It's supposed to be. 
[01:07:00]  He doesn't like sports, so this would be his Super Bowl.  I think I almost had to wet my bed last night.  Oh, no.  I didn't do it.  You did wet your bed recently.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What's that about?  I don't know.  Aren't you too old for that?  Yes, I am.  Like, by 40 years.  Dude, you left the sheets on and came to work, right?  Yeah, I didn't care.  Oh, that's so gross.  I swear to God, I didn't give a fuck.  I went back to sleep.  In the wet sheets?  I don't care.  It's disgusting.  I'll lay in some stuff, too. 
[01:07:30]  In cold ways, I just move over.  Because I'm too tired.  Like, you know, when the kid was sleeping on our bed and stuff.  That's fucking gross.  He would pee all over the place, and I would roll over into it.  I didn't care.  I was too tired.  I couldn't pee.  I wouldn't like it.  Everyone else would fucking get up and change everything.  I'm like, nah, I'll do it in the morning.  I'm tired.  I wouldn't even know.  I'll be out cold.  What if it seeps into the mattress?  Eh, whatever.  I'll buy another one.  I'm fucking rich.  Whoa.  You guys are disgusting and rich.  Weird water dreams?  That's why it's called Filthy Rich. 
[01:08:00]  I don't know.  I'm due for a good mattress, actually, and a new one.  I dreamt that I was at a fucking zoo, and there were these weird animal.  Like, there was a bun.  It was cold.  And then someone said, oh, yeah, those are the warm water animals.  And there was these long rectangular pools of water.  Right.  And I could see under it.  I could see, like, a bear swimming under it.  And I was afraid to get too close, because if I fell in, the bear would get me. 
[01:08:30]  But then I saw it was a warthog swimming in the warm water.  A warthog?  A warthog.  Can you put up a warthog on our screen?  A giant warthog swimming in the warm water.  Who dreams of warthogs?  I don't know.  Maybe it was hog?  Fucking.  Ah.  Hakuna Matata.  But, um...  Oh, that's the animal that looks like it has a mustache.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  And then, uh...  That's the Raleigh fingers.  Steve Martin was in my dream.  Like, I was sitting there.  I had done a performance at a festival, and it was really good. 
[01:09:00]  Right.  And Steve Martin came by, and some other big celebrity recognized me, and they came back  and said hi.  But I went to stand up to shake Steve Martin's hand.  And he said something like, uh, no, no, just stay seated.  Like, he wasn't interested in making up with me.  You never have good celebrity dreams.  Or realistic interactions.  Or real, yeah.  They always go awry.  But, uh, Sam was in my dream.  Ooh.  And it was...  And Kenny was.  And it was around the time of the fucking, uh, the, uh, the zoo. 
[01:09:30]  And they were clowning around or something.  So Kenny was laying on the ground, and Sam was giving him a golden show.  Ah, come on.  It was...  But it wasn't at all...  They weren't doing it sexually.  Like, Kenny was just trying to, like, be crazy.  And it was so weird, because Sam was peeing on his...  He was pissing on Kenny's neck.  He was not in his mouth.  He was on his neck.  As a goof?  Yeah.  And, like, Kenny was, like, getting it all over his shirt collar on purpose, just to 
[01:10:00]  make us go, come on, your shirt's gonna be all wet.  Your shirt collar's gonna be all wet.  That's funny.  I was pissing on Kenny.  He was laying on his back, and you were urinating on him.  All over his neck.  Pissed neck.  Did Sam have a big hog?  No, it was nothing like that.  I didn't see his dick.  It wasn't anything sexual.  It felt like...  It was almost like...  Just trying to do something for a reaction from us.  Which is why I think I had to piss.  That's funny.  I have no idea what the meaning of that dream could possibly be.  I don't know either.  I'd love to know, because I am curious.  And again, there was... 
[01:10:30]  Oh, there was so much more to it.  Yeah.  There's so many people in it.  I don't remember, though.  It's like, we're just beyond my grasp.  You were there, and you were there, and you were there.  Yes.  And there was a yellow brick neck.  He was tickling.  And you were pissing on him.  You know what?  Scott is a dream reader.  Let's go to Scott in Jersey.  Scott, go ahead.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, Jimmy.  If you were having a dream about the zoo, E-Rock must have been in it also.  Well, he was obviously the one on the water. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, I don't know what that means.  That's so weird.  It didn't feel sexual.  It didn't feel dirty.  It was...  Yeah, I know it means something else.  Probably because I had to piss.  Did you feel like you had just shared a laugh with friends?  No, but we were like, oh, God.  Oh, my God.  He's getting all over his shirt collar.  Like, all over the collar of his shirt.  He was going to stand up and have, like, a soppy, wet collar.  Oh.  Soppy, wet collar.  That's a good dream.  I wish I could remember more of it because there was so much.  It's on my tip. 
[01:11:30]  It's a fucking...  You will.  Dreams are weird when you can't remember them.  You kind of...  You remember a little bit of it, and then something happens during the day.  You're like, oh, yeah.  You got to wake up and just talk them into a recorder or write them down immediately.  Some more will pop into your brain.  Some more stuff from the dream.  Anyone see Jurassic Park 3D?  Did pretty well, huh?  I want to fucking see that.  Can you bring a three-year-old to that, do you think?  Probably.  Uh, I did.  It probably could.  Huh?  You did?  Sure.  It's scary when a lawyer gets eaten. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, it's probably a little too scary.  Yeah.  I wonder if it looks good, Jurassic Park 3D.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a re-release.  That's amazing.  Fucking 20-year-old movie or whatever it is.  I'm sure it holds up.  Do they add any other scenes or anything?  I don't think so.  Where they pretty much just...  3D'd the shit out of it.  Just threw the 3D on it?  Yeah, it's pretty, uh...  Even not in 3D.  The first movie holds up.  Dude, that movie's fucking great.  Lost World is horrible.  My...  I gotta say, my new Samsung TV... 
[01:12:30]  You got Samsung TVs, right?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  Tabloids.  Oh.  Nice.  It's just...  Yeah.  It's so crisp.  Do you have a set, though, for soap opera look?  I don't...  I don't...  Movie look?  Do the movies look weird?  Do they look like...  I haven't, like...  Video?  I haven't seen...  I haven't tried out everything I could do.  But I don't think it's on that soap opera look.  I don't think.  And I didn't even have it on 3D.  No.  I was watching the Louisville game.  And I went, oh, fuck, yeah.  Let's put this on 3D. 
[01:13:00]  But the regular looks so amazing.  Is it 3D TV?  I'm not 3D.  HD, I mean.  HD?  Yeah, it's 3D, too.  But I haven't fucked around with it yet.  How much is a new good 3D TV?  About a good one.  Eight million dollars.  Oh, I would have thought more.  I have no idea.  They just bill me.  And I don't know.  I just sign a check.  And I have no idea.  And how much is it?  A good set?  I really don't know.  If you want to get...  I'm a giant like you.  If you want to get something small, like a 65-inch...  That's what I got.  65-inch.  I got a 50-inch.  And I'm thinking of putting the 50-inch in my bedroom.  And then getting rid of the one we got from K-Rox. 
[01:13:30]  That's my bedroom.  You still got that one.  And then fucking...  Yeah, and then just getting like a 44-inch for the living room.  I don't need a 50-inch.  My young son pushed that TV over years ago.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that still a good sex?  I'll give it to somebody.  That was the first casualty of having a kid.  I've lost two big TVs because of my kid already.  Maybe I should wait for Apple TV.  Huh?  Like four grand, really?  I don't want to spend a 65-inch.  For a 3D?  Samsung 65-inch?  With the 3D capability? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, around now.  All right.  I'll tell you.  Nothing beats that fucking 90.  I was watching...  Because when you're sick, what do you do?  You lay on the couch, you watch a lot of television.  And you watch the Brady Bunch.  You watch the Brady Bunch.  And Price is Right.  Things like that.  No, I was on a fucking Sopranos kick.  Really?  Marathoning that shit all over again.  There are some episodes I realized I never even saw.  Really?  Oh, very good, Iraq.  You ever see Big Pussy get killed?  What?  Oh, spoiler alert.  Yeah, there are some episodes I was like... 
[01:14:30]  Especially at the beginning, the first season and second season.  I was like, I don't remember that one.  Yeah.  But, man, you realize...  You get more of an understanding of who is who the second time around.  Oh, really?  Because the first time you're like, wait, who is that?  And he's the boss of that guy.  And that's the best...  You totally get, like, an understanding of it.  And then just...  Like, I don't know how many times I paused and had to go to IMDB.  Who is that?  I've seen that person.  Who is that?  And then you realize, like...  What's his name? 
[01:15:00]  From Aprile, the first one.  The guy that died.  Yeah.  Jackie?  Jackie.  No, no, the other one.  Richie.  Richie or Jackie?  Which one was it?  I don't know.  The first one.  The first one was Richie.  Jackie Jr.  Jackie Jr.  And then there was...  Richie Aprile was the older guy.  The scumbag.  Then there was the Johnny, right?  Jackie was the guy.  Jackie Sr.  Jackie Sr.  I thought you said you had all these guys figured out.  I know.  What happened?  I did for a second ago.  What happened?  I know.  You're right.  And then I'm sick.  I'm confused now.  But, like, he was Grandma from Rounders. 
[01:15:30]  And then I never realized that fucking Dr. Melfi, the mom from Goodfellas,  is the fucking mom from fucking Sopranos.  She's like the mother from...  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Who?  You gotta show me pictures now.  I'm just coughing now.  Like, I'm trying to talk and not cough at the same time.  That's the worst.  Very hard to do. 
[01:16:00]  Which mom?  Stop coughing.  I'm trying to hear you.  Oh, God.  What's the name?  Tony's wife, of course.  Fucking...  Edie.  Edie Falco.  Yeah, yeah.  Carmella.  All right.  Carmella.  She...  Her mom in the show...  Oh, was fucking Lorraine Bracco's mother.  Okay.  Lorraine Bracco's mom in Goodfellas.  I never knew that either.  Yeah, yeah.  How do these people live?  Did you know...  Oh, did you know Dr. Melfi was in Goodfellas? 
[01:16:30]  She played Karen.  Yes, of course.  But, yeah, I was watching that.  I caught SNL, too, which...  I think that one bit is really fucking funny now.  I think we could play it on the air.  That fucking Jacob.  I thought it was funny, too.  It was fucking funny.  Bar Mitzvah Boy, Jacob.  Right.  It's a funny bit.  I think they got a pretty good character there.  I think we could play it into break.  I think it's...  It's kind of fucking funny.  Why don't we play that into break?  It plays like a radio bit. 
[01:17:00]  The...  You know what it is, too, though?  The expression...  Because it's a chick that's doing...  Playing the Jewish boy.  Right.  But it's so over-the-top Jew-y.  Right.  And I just thought it was a funny fucking character.  Yeah.  And then Melissa McCarthy...  That's her name, right?  Melissa McCarthy?  Yeah, she was on...  She was playing the Rutgers coach.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pretty funny.  And the rest is...  Oh, boy.  Speaking of the Rutgers coach, props to Sean Hannity.  One of the only people in the mainstream media that looked at that whole situation... 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, way clearer than most.  Trying to explain that is the culture when you go into a university and play sports.  And he agrees, and I do at this point as well, I guess, that, you know, the coach obviously  went too far, but people are blown off the fact that that's the type of shit you do get  when you get into some of these programs.  Boomer was saying that, too.  Boomer is nice.  Oh, good.  Good for Boomer.  He was saying, you know, that's part of what it is.  MSNBC drove me nuts with this whole situation. 
[01:18:00]  Obviously, there's not one person over there that has ever played, you know, a sport.  Throwing the ball at your head, though, like yelling at the guys they got no problem with.  But they have a problem with the yelling, even.  But Sean Hannity basically said, I don't mind this, you know.  It's building character, is basically what he was saying.  And then it turns out that asshole, the whistleblower, was trying to extort money from the university.  That's coming out today.  Oh, great.  So here you got a disgruntled fuck.  Uh-huh. 
[01:18:30]  Who go, he went to the university with his lawyer and basically said he's disgruntled and  he felt like he was treated wrongly.  Yeah.  So he wanted $950,000 from the university.  The university's like, go fuck yourself.  And then all of a sudden he has this tape.  They shouldn't have said, go fuck yourself.  So that story is not over.  The university should have fucking.  Because now they're questioning if this kid was, you know, trying to extort money from  the university.  But Hannity had a really good take on it.  You know, he was way calmer than the rest of these idiots on TV.  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Basically saying, yeah, okay, maybe the guy went too far.  But you got to understand this is what happens, you know, if you're into sports, especially  on that level, you know, they're motherfuckers.  I remember I said it.  I mean, we had a high school coach who was scared shitless of.  He threw balls and all that stuff.  And he probably, he probably did yell faggot and stuff like that.  You didn't?  I don't know anymore.  That's fucking.  But he probably did, especially, you know, back when we were growing up.  That's the, that was the thing, like the throwing the balls. 
[01:19:30]  But they didn't seem to really care.  Like the players didn't, they didn't look shocked.  No, because they understand.  They didn't look like, hey, what are you doing?  They didn't look hurt.  No, not at all.  They just kind of were like, oh, okay.  I'm sure they, they were, they were saying under their breath, what a fucking asshole and  all that stuff.  But they didn't, you're right.  They didn't care.  Yeah.  And they, and they will just not stop these situations.  They just don't.  Who are these imaginary?  Yeah, I know.  But who are these imaginary people that keep the story going until everyone gets fired? 
[01:20:00]  Because now they're going for the president.  Yeah, yeah.  I love how they do it.  And now the president's going to talk to the student body and the, uh, the teachers today  or tomorrow.  Trying to, he's trying to calm people down because they want him gone too.  Well, then the president should have stuck up for the athletic director.  Like fuck the president too, because these cowards all run for cover.  None of them stick up for each other.  And then they all want, it's like either stick up for your people.  Like the coach goes, okay, but why do all the other people have to get fired?  Right.  If they're all getting fired, why shouldn't he get fired?  And I think the athletic director explained himself, he basically didn't fire the coach 
[01:20:30]  because he thought there would be a lawsuit situation, you know, because everyone sues  all the fucking time.  So he's like, look, I suspended the guy, you know, and, uh, and find him what 50,000, which  is pretty outrageous.  And, and he is, he's admitting now that he was too scared to fire him because of lawsuits,  but that wasn't good enough to save his job.  He's out too.  Well, he resigned.  I mean, they probably were going to fire him, but I know we all know that shit.  You get to leave on your terms instead of getting, you know, disgraced. 
[01:21:00]  It's all bullshit.  They talk to you behind the scenes and go, look, you resign or we're going to fucking,  you know, drag you through the hot coals.  The players have to stick up for your coach though, because it's embarrassing.  It's almost like if there's video of your girlfriend yelling at you going, and I told you to bring  out the goddamn trash.  And you're like, okay, then you got to defend her.  Cause you don't want to go, I'm a pussy whip zilch.  So that's why they're defending this coach.  But it makes a really good point that no one has, uh, pointed out that you do not see any 
[01:21:30]  fear on any of those players faces.  They're not cowering.  They're not cringing or anything.  They're just like, oh fuck.  They're frustrated.  It's like, yeah, he's throwing the ball at our heads again.  You know, what are you going to do?  With that said, you know, obviously the guy went a little, little far, but no one's talking  about that.  Just the fact that is the culture and especially in college sports and in these programs.  Yeah.  Jesus, this is fucking ponderous.  F-ing ponderous. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, I finally saw Vice.  Oh, good.  Fuck yeah, man.  Good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  The HBO, uh, documentary series, whatever you want to call it.  Was the first episode of the Child Suicide Bombers?  Fuck yeah.  I want to see that.  Yeah, it was the, it was, um, the Philippines, how they just murder politicians left and right.  I don't even know why.  Oh, I know why you'd want to be a politician in the Philippines because the, the, you know,  it's so corrupt that you make a shitload of money.  Ah, but the risk.  If you can survive.  Yeah.  But the risk.  It's unbelievable how many politicians they kill in the Philippines. 
[01:22:30]  And of course the New York Times trashed it because it's not journalism.  I just fucking.  Why do they trash it?  Because they're such little cunts.  What are they talking about?  It's not journalism.  Because they're just showing you basically what these situations are like.  Right.  And they're not telling you one way or the other.  Like the, the, the Times is so fucking, it's like, well, sorry that you haven't broken  an interesting story since fucking Serpico, but I, I happen to like this because they're  using real language, they're just real people going and doing this shit. 
[01:23:00]  I find it fascinating.  I'm much more interested in this than some fucking boring, dry, completely opinionated  Times piece.  Oh, I really liked it.  And then, uh, the suicide bombers in Afghanistan using kids, they got some B, they got some,  uh, I don't even want to call it B-roll footage after one of these suicide bombs.  Holy fuck.  There's just a head in the road.  Yeah.  Fucking see that kid come apart like that.  There's just a head.  You're like, where the fuck is the rest of the body? 
[01:23:30]  Was that, and then they show a guy, and this was more disturbing than seeing the head, a  guy running with someone's hand in his hand.  His hand in his hand.  He's running off with someone's hand.  I don't know why.  I wish they explained that.  It was a bummer.  He just found a hand.  He probably was in shock.  They were either holding hands or he picked it up to, to give the guy.  Oh my God.  Imagine it.  It was just a hand.  Maybe that was his hand.  Might've been his other hand.  Oh, you know what?  Oh boy.  Could you put this back on, please?  And he was just kind of holding by a finger or two, and that really creeped me out. 
[01:24:00]  More than seeing the head on the road.  Probably giving back.  He would probably go and say, could you put my hand back on, right?  Jeez.  Maybe that's what it was.  He goes, hey, could you find my hand?  And the guy found his hand for him.  You might be right.  That's the fucking best part of it.  Maybe they had hoped that they could reattach it.  That was good that they showed that stuff, because the regular media doesn't show that stuff.  And you know what?  There is value in seeing.  That's what happens when a bomb goes off.  It's not just this thing you hear about with a puff of smoke.  That's what a hand looks like.  It really brings it home. 
[01:24:30]  You're like, oh, that's terrible.  But they're using kids.  That was just very, very disturbing.  Basically telling the kids that these bombs will explode outward, and they'll be...  And they lie to them?  Yeah, you won't be killed.  And you won't be killed.  Or if you are killed, you know, you're going to be a martyr.  It's all good.  But the Quran basically says, don't kill.  Yeah.  They're terrible.  But the Ammons have said it's okay.  Thus then, the conflict.  Yeah, and they interviewed...  Shane gets in there, and they interview some high...  I remember the Taliban. 
[01:25:00]  They interview some fucking heavy-duty people.  Shane is nuts.  Because Shane goes and talks to a high-level guy in the Taliban.  He has to take a fucking weird ride there.  And then he's in this house, wondering if he's going to get kidnapped.  Yeah, how do you know if you're going to be kidnapped?  Wondering if this is some big, over-the-top setup.  He doesn't know.  That is insane to me.  Yeah, I don't know how they make the connections they make.  And then you see him talking to, like, a guy that was, you know, friends with Osama bin Laden.  Pretty close to Osama bin Laden. 
[01:25:30]  In a room.  And they're just drinking tea.  Yeah.  That's the weird stuff that always fascinates me.  They're sitting there, and he was actually offered tea by, like, a high-ranking official in the Taliban.  It's so strange.  No chairs, though.  I don't understand that.  Get a chair.  They squat.  Oh, that's so uncomfortable.  What if you have a disc problem?  Oh.  That's going to be a nightmare.  I don't know how he gets access to these people, what they tell him that they are shooting.  Crazy. 
[01:26:00]  Just crazy.  What's the next episode?  Is it the next episode of North Korea?  No.  That's the last one of the season.  The next episode is...  I don't remember what the next one is.  I do remember it.  It is the fucking Kashmir-India border.  Oh, right.  Pakistan-India.  Kashmir.  Oh, and people escaping North Korea.  Oh, right, right, right.  I thought there was a North Korean angle there.  Okay.  Yeah, Vice, HBO.  Check it out on demand.  It's really fucking good.  What absolute assholes the Times.  Because it's got great reviews everywhere, but of course the Times had to be done. 
[01:26:30]  Of course.  And you can't help but think we won the human lottery being born in America.  Or, you know, our Canadian pals.  And certainly we got some listeners in Europe and stuff.  But imagine being born in the Philippines.  Holy fuck.  What chance do you got at a good life?  You make a good tranny.  Slim to none.  They're very good trannies from the Philippines.  Oh, there you go.  Okay, here we go.  Let me say hi to Joe in New York. 
[01:27:00]  Joe.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Veteran of the United States Marine Corps Infantry.  I'm just taking a guess.  Hoorah.  Hoorah.  That guy might have been carrying that body part because Muslim tradition, when somebody  dies, they can't go to paradise if all their body parts were not buried together.  Now, I know there's probably little scraps of flesh everywhere, but then it's part of their  tradition.  Yeah, but don't they have to get the scraps of flesh, too?  Or they've decided as long as you get the main body parts? 
[01:27:30]  Every piece they can get, I would imagine their tradition dictates the thing.  Yeah, Jews are like that, too.  They have those ambulance things that drive around, especially in, like, Brooklyn, heavy  Jewish areas, and they drive around.  When there's a car accident or something like that, they soak up the blood in, like, everything  and take that, so...  And then what?  Gwad is somewhere, and he makes a decision if you've got enough of the body before he  allows you to have, what?  Maybe.  Eternity?  Maybe.  Something?  Yeah.  It's so weird.  Something like that.  Religious rules are so weird. 
[01:28:00]  It really is crazy.  We love it.  Someone, thank you, Eric said on things that Babe Ruth was the sultan of SWAT, not sultan  of swing, making E-Rock a horse's ass again.  Yeah, Babe Ruth was the sultan of SWAT.  No, I get...  But I understood sultan of swing was close enough.  That was a Babe Ruth thing.  I was thinking that, too.  But I was just thinking swinging a baseball bat.  I think E-Rock's a fucking idiot.  He is.  Oh, E-Rock, I'm defending you today.  He broke Babe Ruth's record, so how does it not tie in? 
[01:28:30]  He was...  Go ahead.  Well, they're going with the actual nickname is sultan of SWAT, though, right?  And that's the...  But Babe Ruth was the sultan.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah, but Babe Ruth's in the anniversary here.  Yeah, but he's not really the focus of the...  It's more supposed to be...  Again, this picky...  And the sultan of swing is not the sultan of SWAT. 
[01:29:00]  I'd have played the house next door to me.  Oh, there was a lot of racist shit that was going down when Hank Aaron was getting close.  Oh, yeah.  Man, they didn't want a black man beating Babe Ruth's record.  No.  They did not want that at all.  What size is your TV, by the way, to get back to that?  I think it's 65.  Sweet!  You're bringing that back, are you?  Yep. 
[01:29:30]  You don't like that?  No!  Where's my vegetable juice?  Thank you.  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Oh, yeah.  Going back to the Rutgers coach, you're saying that you didn't see any fear on those players' faces.  One reason is because they all know they can kick the crap out of that coach.  Those are all in shape, 19, 20-year-old guys, and it's an old white guy.  Thank you.  The mainstream media were talking like they were innocent, scared kids.  No, but I mean...  If they were 12, 13, 14, 15, fine, it would be different. 
[01:30:00]  Those kids weren't scared of their coach.  I mean, they were scared, but not to the point where they thought something really bad was going to happen to them.  No, but maybe that's the only thing that that coach can do so that he can get their respect.  Because if they wanted to, that group of five or six guys could beat the living crap out of them.  And maybe that's...  That's nice language.  Yeah, there was just a lot of people that were not experts on that story, you know, talking out their ass.  That's what just bothered me. 
[01:30:30]  And I'll say it.  Yeah, I think the coach went too far, but that is absolutely the culture.  If I was a coach, I would really yell at them.  Yeah.  When they were dribbling, I'd say, come on, make a basket.  What are you, a man or a mouse?  That would get them.  Just be encouraging.  Yeah.  You can do it.  You can do it.  Or a tinkle on their necks until their fucking shirts were all sop.  Oh, Margaret Thatcher died. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, she did, huh?  I thought she died years ago.  Oh, Maggie Thatcher.  What?  She just died.  She was that whole fucking Reagan era thing.  87.  Yes.  Hello.  The movie, Meryl Streep was great as her.  Didn't that just happen, that movie?  A year ago or something.  Huh.  Yeah.  Margaret Thatcher has died at the age of 87.  Breaking news.  I swear to you, I thought she died already.  Very fucking interesting, too.  She was fucked to death by a gentleman of color. 
[01:31:30]  Wow, really?  Who saw that coming?  Hell of a way to get it.  Go out.  Lucky girl.  I don't know.  You think her pussy was a disaster at the end of her life?  Of course.  Yeah, and the beginning.  The internet now is, there's no mysteries anymore.  You absolutely can find out what an 87-year-old pussy looks like if you feel Prince Philip's  son.  Are we ready for this?  87-year-old pussy?  Feel so inclined.  Yeah, let's look. 
[01:32:00]  Let's just look.  Let's see what happens here.  Put in 87, too.  I want to, oh, okay.  87.  Let's see.  I thought she was born from 1987.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So far, it's a lot of young gals.  A lot of young, naked gals.  All right.  Still no 87-year-old pussy.  Yeah.  Old woman pussy.  Fair enough.  Now you've got to find one that looks kind of old woman pussy.  Madonna comes up. 
[01:32:30]  No, that's about a 60-year-old.  We're looking for an 80.  Nat lady's like 30.  No, that's not 87.  Put in 100-year-old pussy.  Go ahead.  Oh, wait.  Right there.  Move down.  All right.  Go over.  No, over to the left.  Right, right, right.  I see where you move.  Sam.  Over the other way.  Right there, yeah.  That's the obvious one.  Ew.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  That looks like a tongue.  Is that real, you think?  Oh, look.  It's dripping down.  It's like, rrr.  It's Photoshop.  It looks like the mouth on the scream mask. 
[01:33:00]  And she's probably 75 anyway.  We've got to go older than that.  Yeah.  She has cute hair.  Put in that 100-year-old pussy.  See what comes up.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it might be like the exaggeration.  Yeah, I know.  I don't see.  A lot of cockpicks.  Yeah.  A girl eating some other girl's ass.  It's a good with the bad.  Because they're all...  Yeah, what the fuck?  Maybe I'm wrong?  You can't find old lady pussy?  That's too bad.  On the intra-tubes?  You can't find fucking beheadings. 
[01:33:30]  All kinds of shit.  But what?  They don't want to show old lady pussy.  God, so you put...  I guess the porn industry's on to us, because it's all hot chicks if you put in 100-year-old  pussy.  They just see the pussy word in the searching.  And that's it.  Um, hmm.  Old woman, old pussy.  No, keep it like that.  All right, let's see what comes up now.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:34:00]  Anything?  No?  Nothing comes up.  I'm searching for it.  All right.  Tying up Google.  Nope.  All that.  God, man.  What the fuck?  Why can't we look at old pussy today?  Google filters shit like that?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Now we're at old nasty bitches.  Older nasty bitches.  Let's see.  Nope.  Not old.  No, man.  We want old.  Geriatric.  Geriatric vagina.  Very good.  Geriatric vagina.  Senior citizen pussy. 
[01:34:30]  Exactly.  You might have to put the C word.  No, no pussy.  Vagina.  Oh, God.  How about just old lady nude?  Oh, God.  What?  Nothing.  Fuck.  Come on, man.  Come on.  Did you put geriatric?  We're trying everything.  Fuck, man.  That's too bad.  It's really a shame.  Naked old lady.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What is that?  Looks like from The Shining.  All right. 
[01:35:00]  That's, that's, oh, my God.  God.  That, oh, my God.  That looks like a monster.  It really does.  Her skin isn't fucking.  Oh, my God.  Would you hit it?  Grandma Gertrude.  Wow.  That's brutal.  Would you do it, Jimmy, for the story?  No, I wouldn't even talk to her.  If she needed medicine, I wouldn't hand it to her.  Oh, my God.  No, I wouldn't.  Oh, my God.  You know it smells sour.  Yeah.  You know it smells sour.  It's awful.  Oh, my God. 
[01:35:30]  There's nothing good about it.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Oh, our vegetable juice is here.  Juice.  Oh, cock.  Right.  Spill it.  Spill it.  Those goddamn Nathan's fries.  They had them at Meadowlands.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, those big, just meaty fucking French fries.  Pretty fucking good, huh?  Yeah, they had nothing even close to healthy to eat.  Man, America just doesn't want to eat healthy.  No, it's very difficult when you're out. 
[01:36:00]  And they know at sporting events and these big events, they just know that it's a waste  of time to even offer it.  It's very difficult.  And everyone just wants fried food.  I think they'd do better than they think, though, if they had, like, grilled chicken  or healthy.  I bet you that they would do better than they think they would do.  There wasn't anything close to healthy at this thing.  Popcorn is as good as you could have gotten.  And they salt the shit out of that.  And that was sold out.  Yeah.  Man.  That's fucked up.  Yeah, you can't.  It's weird.  Man, I fucking make a disastrous mess of my house when I'm fucking, like, sick. 
[01:36:30]  Really?  Like, for the most part, I might pick up a plate and bring it back into the kitchen and  put it in the sink.  Like, I mean, my fucking, my house, I feel bad.  Andrew's going over there.  I think the four Mexican maids have to go in there.  You feel bad every Monday.  But, yeah, yeah, it's so bad.  Every Monday you say the exact same thing.  I feel bad she has to go over there today.  You're right.  Worse than ever.  But today, worse than ever.  I think there's half a banana on my night table. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Where's the other half?  Half a banana.  I feel bad for your proctologist.  What the fuck were you up to?  Half a banana.  You lose the other half somewhere.  Oh, you fuck.  Were you playing poker this weekend?  I saw you tweet a picture of some chips.  What's that?  Yeah, yeah, I played a little poker.  At your house?  Yeah.  But, you know, I wasn't really into it. 
[01:37:30]  Why not?  Because I just felt like shit the whole time.  I thought I saw poker chips.  Yeah.  What's that?  Yeah, I'm just like fucking, I left everything.  I think there's like, like I made some eggs at one point.  I didn't even rinse out any of the bowls or put them in the sink.  Like they're exactly where they were, still stuck on the fucking shit.  On the counter.  It's like glue.  Jesus.  Oh, it's terrible.  You should take pictures of that. 
[01:38:00]  It's horror.  I really.  That's the stuff I would love to see on your Twitter.  It's really bad.  Your house looked like a disaster.  Disaster.  But the maids will be there today.  Hopefully they clean my room first because I'm beelining it right into fucking bed.  I hope your shit's all over the floor.  Oh, Mr. Anthony, we just need two hours.  Hola.  They're vacuuming.  I was going to stand.  I got to stand there sometimes.  Well, they're vacuuming my bedroom.  Wait.  I want to go to sleep. 
[01:38:30]  And people think you don't understand real problems anymore.  I was going to say, the listeners could really relate to that one.  I say it on purpose.  Believe me.  They're creeped out.  They are picking up diapers and cum out of the same bedroom.  Condoms.  Jesus.  Oh, God damn.  And then taking fucking cold medicine on an empty stomach?  Right.  That's bad.  Yeah.  You just fucking stomach ache and then you crap. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, and then you got to fucking put your undies in the sink.  Why?  Just fucking.  Do you got undies in the sink?  I've done the undies in the sink before.  Just throw them out.  What are you saving them for?  Do your underwear stink, you think?  Wait, wait, wait.  Are they hanging out in the sink or do you have to wash them in the sink?  I've been known to wash some underwear in the sink.  I rinse them out.  I usually do it in the shower because I'm ready to take a shower and I'll take my underwear off.  And if it's, you know, I just throw the underwear in the shower with me. 
[01:39:30]  Throw it, you guys.  I'll squeeze a little shampoo on it and let it simmer while I'm showering.  I don't want to be embarrassed.  I've been known to wash out a good racing strike in my own sink.  If I did my own fucking laundry, I wouldn't give a shit.  My underwear's never fucked up like that.  But the inside of my asshole right now, put your finger in, Sam.  You'll be amazed.  It'll stink a little bit.  Let me tell you something.  You don't drink Guinness.  That's a good point.  Why?  Because if you drink Guinness or you like, like I said, like cold medicine.  You've never had a good shmear on your underwear? 
[01:40:00]  I haven't.  A good shmutz?  My asshole is a delight.  It's a delight.  A stickle of shit on the back of your fucking underwear?  Sure.  I had it on my chest.  I'm just saying it doesn't happen anymore.  I'm mortified, man.  I use my palm like it's a rock, like I'm washing down by the river.  Yeah.  Oh, I'll wash them out and then throw them all wet on the top of the laundry piles and  everyone else knows what the hell I just did.  Oh, I'm fucking embarrassed.  This asshole can get some things done. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, my God.  You know what it is?  I think I've trained my asshole to always be clean because it's always puckering for a  massage finger.  Oh, my asshole is always like, like, like going for like little massage finger kisses.  And I always need it to be clean.  Really?  Yeah.  It looks like one of those kissing garami fish.  I tweeted over the weekend that I had duty that can only be described as radioactive.  You ever have radioactive duty?  Radioactive?  Where it hits the water and then like, like, like it starts dying the, the toilet bowl water. 
[01:41:00]  Whoa.  And it smells of high heaven.  Like steeping tea?  Oh, it's horrendous.  It was like radioactive as soon as it hit the water.  Disgusting.  Like radioactive shit was coming off it, it looked like.  Wow.  Crazy.  I was proud.  Oof.  I love a good long fucking log.  Love it.  I drop a long log.  I just, it's, it's, it's that little childish part of you. 
[01:41:30]  When you take a big shit, you want to jump up and go, look what I made.  Look, look, I made it myself.  And nobody wants to see it.  It's almost like if Michelangelo, all of his artwork, people like, ew.  I just want to show people when I think of giant shit.  We, uh, we should go back to the Scorch tape, I'm thinking.  Oh my God, yeah.  We got derailed last week.  I, I hear tell.  Louis CK came in and other people and, uh, we didn't get back to the Scorch, his latest 
[01:42:00]  PFG TV.  People like that.  I hear tell there was a one after that and the table's gone.  Oh, really?  Somebody posted something on Twitter with a picture.  Right.  photo and said, uh, the latest one and the, the table's gone.  The, the, the giant table's ridiculous.  You gotta keep it though.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll, uh, maybe play some PFG TV.  Yeah, but he's got a new set.  Hey, wait, it's a whole new set. 
[01:42:30]  Wait, cause we made fun of the set too.  Maybe, maybe we're 72 views.  Maybe we're kind of helping him out.  72 views.  It's not a lot.  Uh, just, uh, huh?  He obviously knows when something's up because it goes like, you know, episode one, 200 views.  Episode two, 290 views.  Episode three, 6,700 views.  Oh, it's because of us.  Yeah.  The Lacey Rain probably thought it was because of her.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  That's right. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  He's probably like, hey, the show's catching on.  And then the next one's 72.  So why don't we just go with the brand new one he posted?  Fuck it.  We should.  Why don't we do a little bit of that after the break?  That last one was good.  They're all good though.  So fuck it.  Let's go to the new one without the table.  See what changes he made.  You want to play this SNL thing too?  How long is it?  Three minutes.  I thought it was funny.  Ann turned me on to it this morning.  I don't really watch SNL anymore.  It's a pretty funny character.  I don't know.  But Ann said this character's pretty funny and then we played it before the show and I  was laughing.  The expressions are pretty funny though. 
[01:43:30]  So I'm not sure.  Because we all know a Jewy Jew.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, they're certainly pulling that off here.  It's that sketch.  It's the, I don't think it translates just audio.  It's that whole thing.  So we don't want to play it?  We don't have to play it.  Yeah.  Where the kid looks over at Seth and then like slowly looks back at the paper.  Like it's a lot of expressions.  Right.  So I don't think it really plays for just audio.  Someone showed me, there's a picture in the Times online and somebody wrote, isn't that 
[01:44:00]  Norton texting in the picture online for the Times review of HBO's Vice?  If that is, it is me in the background texting.  You could see me, but it's at the party.  Oh.  That's funny.  That's me at the table alone texting.  Oh my goodness.  Oof.  And then what?  Dennis Falcone wrote an email to me?  What's this about?  Stop coughing.  I'm trying to do something.  I'm trying.  Oh, Jesus.  At least I could.  I really would.  Oh, that's terrible.  One of my old pals is out of work? 
[01:44:30]  Fuck.  Really?  I don't want to say his name.  I worked with him at BAB.  He's a good guy.  Really good guy.  Wait.  Do I know him?  Yeah, you would know him.  Oh.  Write it down.  Fuck.  How do we help these people out?  Who is it?  Uh-oh.  Send them cyanide.  Eat this.  Oh, God.  Fuck.  Now what?  Do I have to write another check for somebody?  Oh, boy.  Is that what?  He says he's not. 
[01:45:00]  I'm trying to get sick, too.  He says he's not looking for money.  It's terrible.  But that means he's looking for money.  When you write, I'm not looking for money, that means you are looking for money.  Of course you are.  Yeah.  What else do you say without giving up his name?  Oh, look at that.  Hey there, man.  Hey there, man.  First off, I'm not looking for money.  I'm not looking for a job.  I'm not looking for money.  And I'm not looking for you to play records for any of our labels on the show.  Uh-huh.  Oh, wait.  Maybe he's not looking for work.  Oh, wait a minute.  I just need you to take care of my wife. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, shit.  I kill myself.  Oh, all right.  Oh, no.  He's good.  I'm a cuckold.  Yes, I need you to come in her pussy.  Like a cream pie.  No, he's just an old friend reaching out.  All right.  Okay.  I'm just reaching out to check in, man.  I'm not wicked Twitter savvy.  And I've gotten as far as rolling on the phone to get a hold of you.  But that was it.  The last time we had lunch, you had literally just signed the deal with XM.  And, jeez, a lot has happened since then, eh? 
[01:46:00]  Not here.  Oh, he just wants to do lunch.  Oh, okay.  Oh, who is it?  No, he's a good guy.  I was scared that he was out of work.  He went into the music biz.  He went from radio to the other side.  He works for a big label.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Fuck.  That scared me for a second.  It means nothing to anyone.  I'm sorry.  We're going to do some Scorch shit next, I think.  Right?  Yes, please.  I love it. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  You got what I need.  But you say he's just a friend.  And you say he's just a friend.  Oh, baby.  You got what I need.  You say he's just a friend.  All right.  Ant's fading fast.  Uh-huh.  And we got a song about friends.  I bet it's motherfucking two show. 
[01:47:00]  I got arrested, right?  Bismacky's birthday.  What?  Bismacky's birthday.  How old is he?  Like 49?  49, yeah.  Ah, what's your guess?  Good guess.  There's a lot of AIDS shit today, too.  AIDS?  Yeah, Arthur Ashe announced he had AIDS 21 years ago.  And then Ryan White died 23 years ago from AIDS at age 18.  Ryan White would be 41.  Everyone has AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS. 
[01:47:30]  AIDS, AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  And so this is the end of our story.  And everyone is dead from AIDS.  It took from me my best friend.  My only true pal.  My only bright star.  Well, I'm going to march on Washington.  Lead the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us. 
[01:48:00]  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father.  AIDS.  My sister.  AIDS.  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The gays and the straights and the whites and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS.  My grandma and my dog go blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The pulpit's got it and so do you.  Come on everybody, we got quilting to do.  We're gonna break down these barricades.  Everyone has AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS. 
[01:48:30]  Jeez, I just wanted to announce this.  What the hell?  Apparently everyone has AIDS.  It's a day in history and then we get into a whole song because of it.  You have AIDS. Yes, you have AIDS. I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS. You've got the AIDS. You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here. Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here. It isn't clear, but what we're certain of is you have AIDS. Yes, you have AIDS. Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS. 
[01:49:00]  Be sure that you see that this is non-HIV. But full-blown AIDS. Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS. I'm sorry, I wish it was something less serious.  It's just this day in history, man. Ryan White, 23 years ago. He died from AIDS. Arthur Ashe announces he has AIDS. 21 years ago today. That's it, right? You don't have another one, do you? 
[01:49:30]  No, I'm good. Put it there. Ooh, grapes today. Give me. I would like a red grape. No. Oh, Edgar. Did you wash them? You're fired. I don't think he gets it. Oh, he's laughing a little bit at you. Shut up. He's laughing at you, Edgar. 
[01:50:00]  Well, we got PFG TV ready to go here. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Queued up and ready to go. Yeah, this is the latest episode. We were just getting into the last episode, but now there's a new episode since then, which is even better because we get to go through his thrilling intro again. I want more Lacey Rain, though. I loved her. Yeah? Fuck yeah, we got to get her on the show to talk about this fucking show. She was wonderful. Yes. You really care what she has to say or you want to just hook up with her? Let's be honest. 
[01:50:30]  I would love to hook up with her, but honestly, I would love to hear more about Scorch's show. Oh. I would love to talk about Scorch's show. Why the fuck haven't we been invited on Scorch's show with all the promoting we're doing for him, Sam Roberts? I don't know. You know people in his camp still, right? I feel guilty after we do these segments. Why? We gave him 7,000 views on his last episode. He only does 200 views. I know, but he doesn't like to be mocked, I don't think. 
[01:51:00]  He told me that he got Triple H into the business, you know? He told me that, too. Oh, yeah. Triple H, who's now running the WWE, and Scorch is somewhere in New Hampshire. You know what Scorch was a wrestling manager? You know what his name was? What? Vito Carlucci. And who did he manage? Yeah, who did he manage? Local talent, mainly. He made it sound like it was WWF guys back in the day. 
[01:51:30]  Entering the day, WWF. They kind of fell through at the very last minute. Why? He'd be great for them. That's some information I got from Scorch, actually. Scorch? Scorch, let me know. How close was he? Very close. I mean, as close as one can be. Really? Oh, yeah. He actually, I think, decided to go for radio, if I remember correctly. That's kind of smart. Yeah. But he did get Triple H in the business before he left, so. He did? Yeah. You think that's true? Do I think it's true, or was I told it's true? Well, I know you were told it was true. I was told it was true. 
[01:52:00]  No, I do not think it's true. No, I think that's not true. Where's Triple H from? He's kind of from up that area, right? Technically, Scorch and Triple H both went to Killer Kowalski's wrestling school. Is that true? I know Triple H did. I know Scorch was associated with that indie group. He probably knows them. What do we know about Scorch that is true? Scorch's pizza. 
[01:52:30]  People are looking for hamburger. What do we know about him? That's true. What do we know about him? Because it seems like it's all one big fabrication. I'm a secret agent. Right. Without further ado, let's get into Scorch's PFG TV Season 6, Episode 4. Now, do you want the summary of the episode like last time? Yeah, definitely. Okay. In this week's episode, we've got an interview with former Bruin Scott Young. I hope you're a hockey fan, Scott Young. Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Scott Young played for the Bruins. Okay, that's pretty much all. That's the ground that you would cover? Yeah, I don't know much about him. Okay. We've got a live musical performance by Sarah Lakita and the Problematics, along with an interview with Sarah Lakita.  Yeah. Actor-Comedian Steve Sweeney. Oh, boy. Steve Sweeney made it.  Stops in to tell some jokes with Scorch and Sibby. Oh, my God. That's a key phrase. I can't wait to hear Scorch trample, trample his setups. 
[01:53:30]  Because he didn't say, tell jokes to Scorch and Sibby. Right. Okay.  Oh, I love it. Sweeney's funny, man.  This is an action... Well, so is Scorch and Sibby. Yes.  This is an action-packed show that you don't want to miss. You can now watch Scorch's PFG TV on WFXT Saturday mornings at 2.30 a.m.  That's not Saturday morning. That's in the middle of the goddamn night. Yeah. 
[01:54:00]  That's not Saturday morning. I guess technically it's morning, but what the hell is he talking about?  It still says that the show's live. Okay. Even though we could see the sun coming through the shades.  Well, he's not going anywhere Saturday at 2.30 a.m. to do a live TV show.  Right. Well, I would like to see the great opening of the pier.  You sure you don't want to skip it since we've seen the opening before? 
[01:54:30]  No, man. Oh, please.  I love looking at New Hampshire in the open.  All right. Let's take a look at New Hampshire.  Well, it's not New Hampshire, though, is it?  It's not? I've never been.  Live from the Santa Monica Pier in beautiful California... No.  Why does he have the Santa Monica Pier in his open?  At one point, there's an over... The airport that's shown is LAX.  Yeah. Yeah.  But that has nothing to do with New Hampshire. I don't get it.  There may be flights to the New Hampshire area.  From PFG Television Center at Red 13 Studios, welcome to Scorch's PFG TV. 
[01:55:00]  I am Lord Doug Man W. Godspeed.  Tonight, on another exciting episode, two-time Stanley Cup winner and NHL legend, Scott Young.  Also, you know him from Something About Mary and over 20 other motion pictures.  It's Boston funny man, Steve Sweeney.  And special musical guest, Limelight Magazine Song of the Year award winner, Sarah Lakita and the Problematics. 
[01:55:30]  And, of course, legendary disciple of rock and roll greatness, it's Scorch's co-host, Sebastian.  So, let's give it up for your host, Scorch, Sebastian.  Pause.  As we mock him, let's not forget, we don't have a visual element on this show.  We're not doing some big fucking half-hour TV talk show.  Yeah.  I mean, you could if you wanted to.  And, look, why is he coming out with... 
[01:56:00]  Like, they didn't fade out the fucking other graphic.  Look.  It's a slow cross dissolve.  Slow cross, yeah.  But he's not starting on the chair this time.  That's way too slow.  He's not starting on the chair.  Is he doing a monologue?  He's walking out and he is pretending that there's an audience that he's asking to quiet down.  Right.  Even though that's obviously a pre-recorded track.  Alright, let's go.  Welcome, my friends.  Here we are.  Here we are the very first episode.  I'm going to talk about this in a second, but this is actually the very first episode 
[01:56:30]  that we are filming to be alive on Fox 25.  What?  How can you...  Wait a minute.  ...film an episode to be alive?  To be alive on Fox 25.  But he got on Fox 25?  Did he?  Did he, Opie?  I don't know.  I don't either.  You can't take his word for it.  Fox 25 is the Fox affiliate out of Boston or New Hampshire?  Infomercial?  It's 2.30 a.m.  Did he pay?  See, that's what people do.  They buy infomercial time and just play a show. 
[01:57:00]  It's not like they picked up the Scorch PFG.  No, he conned somebody into paying for his show.  It's an infomercial.  Wait, I think I just got tricked by Scorch.  Yeah, you did.  I was believing his hype.  I'm like, holy shit, Fox 25.  Louie watches us.  Oh, Louie.  You think he's going to mention that soon?  All right, let's go.  We made it.  We made it.  We made it. 
[01:57:30]  We made it.  Tim Osabi.  And you all know my pal, Stim Hashing, right?  Give it up for Stim.  Give it up, everybody.  We're now on Fox 25.  You know what I'm saying?  So, yeah.  What's up with you, man?  What's happening in the life?  No big table.  It sounds like the crowd is dubbed in.  Even though they probably are.  Are they there?  There's some people there, probably.  You think when he said, yeah, he's saying it for like three people?  They're sweetening the crowd a little bit.  Yeah.  A little sweetening.  A little.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:58:00]  A little sweetening.  A little.  A little bit.  He's saying it's a little bit.  A little bit.  Just sweetening it up a little bit.  Just a little.  Give it a little punch.  A little splash.  A little splash.  Yeah, yeah.  We need a little splash more.  You know, you've got to supplement those live applause.  Right.  Just something to beef it up a little.  Just a little bit.  Fill in the dead spots.  That's right.  But Sid Nash, well, I just want to tell you right off that I had the best time reading  both.  What's good is when somebody disappears into the furniture, which is A, way too high, and B, 
[01:58:30]  it's a black leather couch and this idiot's wearing black pants and a black shiny vest  and a black shirt.  It literally looks like there's a head and two arms.  It looks like his head and his hands are sticking out of the couch.  You're right.  He's wearing a leather vest on a leather couch.  Yeah.  It's a terrible outfit.  What are you doing, man?  He's blending right into the couch.  That's funny.  Yes.  And you know how you can usually tell when a room is full of people?  If the voices of the hosts echo. 
[01:59:00]  Right, right.  And you can tell there's lots of people.  Lots of people for it to echo off of.  Yeah.  Yeah, but they sweeten that up in post.  A little beefing up.  A little bit.  Hack by one of our first guests, Jimmy Dunn.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, there's a couple of pages in here.  One line is that it's worth the whole price.  So if you get a chance to get it, you know, for us guys, we like to bring something in  the, you know, the Bacauza.  And something we can leave there and read a couple, you know, pages every day.  This is the book.  Thanks, Jimmy, for coming on. 
[01:59:30]  Thanks for writing another book.  And you know what?  I'd love to see a boat hack, too.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm sorry.  What's the Bacauza?  A, it's the way a dumbbell says toilet.  But he didn't say what the line was.  There's one line in here.  Can you go back?  Sure.  This is, this should be on a website called worstbookdescriptions.com.  There's a thing in here.  It's the best line.  How about telling us?  Listen, there's an atrocious book endorsement. 
[02:00:00]  By the way, he still has the end table.  Yeah, well, I wouldn't.  All right, that's all right.  Yeah, you've got to put your notes there so they don't fall off.  The table table's gone.  That's really cool, too, when the angle shows 30 feet of the wall behind you.  It's like he's sitting in front of the elevator on The Shining.  It's red and black.  I like to think that the table was repoed because he didn't pay his pottery bar.  I think that's it.  Yeah.  He's a rent-a-center.  Troy Aikman came and took it back.  We're taking your table, brother.  You know, Hogan.  Yeah, you really want to see that much. 
[02:00:30]  That's a great camera angle.  Show how small they are in the room.  We got the rule of thirds.  One third is the people, then two thirds is dead space.  Yeah, exactly.  The dead wall space, which is distracting from...  There's everything wrong with this visually.  All right, let's only hear the great point.  Because this made me want to run out and buy it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's hear this.  It's a great opening as opposed to a monologue.  And you all know my pal, Sib Hashan, right?  Give it up for Sib, everybody.  And now I'm on Fox 25, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:01:00]  Oh, sorry.  So, yeah.  What's up with you, man?  What's happening in the life of Sib Hashan?  Well, I just want to tell you right off that I had the best time reading Boat Hack by one  of our first guests, Jimmy Dunn.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, there's a couple of pages in here.  One line is that it's worth the whole price.  So, if you get a chance to get it.  You know, for us guys, we like to bring something.  Oh, my God.  What?  There's a couple of...  There's an entire book.  There's a couple of pages in here. 
[02:01:30]  There's one line.  So, I'm supposed to rifle through 148 uninteresting pages to get to one line while I shit?  He is a terrible co-host.  Holy shit.  I don't know what he's talking about.  I know.  He has a funny word for bathroom, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, it sure does.  You like that, right?  Yeah, it's very funny.  If you get a chance to get it.  You know, for us guys, we like to bring something in the, you know, the Bacauza. 
[02:02:00]  I've never heard it called the Bacauza.  I haven't either.  I haven't either.  You haven't?  That's what the name of the studio should be.  The Bacauza Room.  Everything is shit.  It's shit.  I'm glad you explained that.  And something we can leave there and read a couple of pages every day.  Hey, this is the book.  Thanks, Jimmy, for coming on.  Thanks for writing another book.  No close-up on the book.  Nah, why would they?  Terrible camera work.  Now they're back on the fucking three-quarter room angle. 
[02:02:30]  It shows Scorch and this guy in the middle of the fucking frame.  Giant red and black striped wall behind them.  Black couch.  And he's holding up the fucking book, hoping the camera catches it.  And it's on the wrong angle.  That's a two-shot.  What are they doing?  Everything they're doing is wrong.  There's too much space in that frame not being used.  And you know what?  I'd love to see a boat hack, too.  Because it's one of those books where, you know, I was sorry it was ending.  Plus, you're in the bathroom a long time.  Many, many times in the day.  That was disgusting. 
[02:03:00]  Jimmy, for those that haven't followed along, Jimmy, I asked him to come and be part of this  show again, this first taping for Fox.  But Jimmy is actually going to, he's in a media freeze because he got signed to be in a sitcom  on another network.  But it's actually a fun time.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  These are the little things that I love.  This is brilliant.  No, you missed the other one.  This is brilliant.  This is the only reason why I love playing this shit. 
[02:03:30]  He, in his mind, is the biggest fucking thing on TV.  I love it.  He said on another network.  Another network.  He's competing with everybody, man.  He can't mention another network.  There's a media freeze.  They're not allowing someone to be on a show that's on another network.  You're not talking about me.  I'm not going to talk about them.  Does he mean Fox 25?  Yeah.  He's part of the Fox family now.  Right.  He does an infomercial on it. 
[02:04:00]  No, he's part of the Fox family.  This is brilliant.  So he's not going to mention another network.  That would be stupid.  That would be stupid.  Is it a media freeze?  I got to hear that again.  I got to hear what he's fucking talking about.  That's brilliant.  Well, the long Jimmy, I asked him to come and be part of this show again, this first taping  for Fox, but Jimmy is actually going to, he's in a media freeze because he got signed to  be in a sitcom on another network. 
[02:04:30]  But it's actually a, it's a prime time show.  I mean, a prime time show.  Hold on.  See, he found something.  So what, what, what he's saying is that everyone who does like Leno, it has to be a show from  NBC.  Right.  No, you have them on and you just say another network.  Yeah, but he's not on that level.  No, he's not even going, like he can't even go on Scorch.  What do you see when Jimmy's in a media freeze?  A media freeze.  Because that's what you do as soon as you get a sitcom, you go into a media freeze because  you don't want to promote it.  Yeah, yeah, you don't tell anybody about it.  You keep it under your hat. 
[02:05:00]  Oh my God.  So like New Girl and the Mindy Project and those shows, they don't get promoted.  No, they can't.  Because Fox doesn't have a late night show.  Right.  You can't do it.  Little Scorch, you understand, right?  Yeah, don't give me any credit, Scorch.  We can't mention the competition.  You understand, right?  Ah, but yeah, but you don't have anything to worry about.  Say he's in a media freeze.  He's in a media freeze.  He can't do it.  He would have been good.  A media freeze on another network.  Oh God. 
[02:05:30]  God bless him.  He is huge in his mind.  He is.  Off our show.  Oh, he admitted that.  By the way, I'm still waiting to hear if there's any actual applause.  I'm not sure if there's.  Ah.  He's got friends, I'm sure.  I'm sure of this.  I would bet there's about 10 people in there.  Okay.  And then they sweeten it up in post.  Give a little spice.  A little spice.  Okay.  Every other line was, of course, BFU TV and they got pissed off at him, but they still  let him stay, you know what I mean?  So what else is going on in your life? 
[02:06:00]  Well, you know, I'm really excited about tonight's show.  Yeah.  You know, we've got a professional hockey player on.  There's a head and arms in that couch.  No way.  That couch has a head and arms.  It just looks like a head and arms sticking out of the couch.  What a horrible outfit for that couch.  Oh, my God.  He couldn't have picked worse if he was doing weather in a fucking green shirt and pants.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, my God. 
[02:06:30]  Is that atrocious?  Two Stanley Cups.  Yeah.  A local guy, too.  An American.  A rare breed.  And we got the fantastic Sarah Laquita band.  I love that.  Yep.  How good is that?  And Mr. Steve Sweeney's in the house.  Steve Sweeney's in the house.  In the house.  Boston legend.  Big movie star.  Steve Sweeney's here, y'all.  So that basically.  Steve Sweeney's a big movie star. 
[02:07:00]  You know what's up with my life these days?  Yes, he is, y'all.  Now, Scorch is going to tell you what's up with his life these days.  Yeah, I'd like to know.  I'm just glad nobody asked him.  He can't get that Fox 25 thing out enough.  I could be on the Fox affiliate here in New York.  Yes.  I could go and say, I would like to buy a half hour of time.  How much is that?  When you get infomercial time at 3 in the morning, whatever it is, and go on and do it.  You're allowed.  Yeah, and then you go to a local access studio and they will allow you to film in that studio for free. 
[02:07:30]  There you go.  You got a show.  You want to do it?  Yeah, let's do it.  Yeah, we should do that.  Nah, it takes work.  That would be funny if we did that.  That would be very funny.  If we did a public access show.  Well, that's what we did up in Boston.  Real Rock TV.  I mean, they bought time on a Spanish station and we're on.  That was a really high budget, though.  They shouldn't have shown when you ran out and you made the noise.  No, I put a mic.  Is this so frenzy?  You remember that, huh? 
[02:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's my favorite moment.  Oh, we got to go.  I was hoping you forgot about that.  You remember that, huh?  My favorite moment in the entire thing.  Fucking hack.  Stupid fucking hack.  Let's see what's coming on in Scorchers.  Sure, let's do it.  So that basically fills the deal.  You know what's up with my life these days?  No one is.  I crash my Jeep.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  I crash my Jeep doing no more than five miles an hour.  I crash my Jeep.  Who was in the Jeep with you?  A friend of mine. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  You know, I have a new young lady in my life.  Hey, Kimmy, nice to see you.  And the first day that Simby met her, Simby gave her one of his pat-downs.  And for no reason at all, all of a sudden, Simby gets out of the barstool and says,  Oh, I'm going to pat you down.  And I'm like, I noticed, though, as I think about it, he didn't say pat you down.  What did I say?  Pat you down.  Pat you down.  You know what I mean?  This could be, could possibly be, the most inane, useless, boring conversation 
[02:09:00]  I've ever heard.  Do you know what it is?  This is devoid of charm.  It is drivel.  It's absolutely, it's literally charmless noise.  Oh, man, little Scorch.  What are you thinking of that?  I don't, I think it's interesting.  You're jealous, Scorch.  They're always jealous.  Everybody's jealous of you, buddy.  We're on Fox 25. 
[02:09:30]  We'll get back to this in a minute here.  Fox 25.  Remind the audience.  People care about my life and what happens, right?  Yeah, tell me about the Jeep.  This is not.  Say hi to Kimmy.  A story you convey to people.  It's good Scorch is wearing, he has a fucking, a burg, like a weird orangish colored couch  which blends into the fucking red wall behind.  All these colors are horrid.  No thought.  No thought was given to what was going to be on the couches, what was going to be behind  them.  Yeah.  The lighting, the camera angles, nothing. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, but he'll fix that because he got rid of the big fucking table because of us.  Fuck Dwayne Burr.  I want to do a talk show where I have a bright red suit on and I'm sitting in a bright red  chair.  That would be great.  That would be great.  That's right.  You intentionally did it.  Mm-hmm.  You should just do a series of really bad one-off talk shows on random public access channels.  I'd love to.  Just see what sticks.  That'd be fun, actually.  Yeah.  All right.  Continue.  All right.  Congratulations.  Well, thank you, man.  You know what?  Thank you very much.  Your mother's got to be really happy. 
[02:10:30]  Well, it's good because I was finally able to stop dating her.  So that's a good thing, you know.  Anyhow, yeah, we got a great show today.  Let this up, man.  You know, indicator.  We have a great show today despite we haven't even had a mildly interesting moment yet.  Poor Scorch.  Why did he mention crashing his Jeep?  Because it was really a great, it gets you curious.  Yeah, he said, he's kind of endearing himself to the audience.  He's being like, you know, hey, look, it happens to me, too. 
[02:11:00]  But he never explained why he crashed at five miles an hour.  Well, no, why would he?  Why would he have follow-up?  That would be interesting because that's almost impossible to do.  It was at least the beginning of a story.  I'd love to hear the end.  I would have liked that one.  Wow, Thatcher led Britain from 79 to 90.  That was it?  She was done in 1990?  Then John Major picked up.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, if you don't know, Margaret Thatcher died. 
[02:11:30]  The Iron Lady.  Yes.  Yeah, well, she obviously always had neatly pressed clothes.  She was the Iron Lady.  Jesus.  Now let's get back to the board.  Space shot.  No, that reminds me of Clyde from Weird News, folks.  Oh, yeah.  We should bring the song back.  Weird news.  Can you make this big, Tim?  Now let's start off with the human statue story, okay?  In Australia, you know human statues. 
[02:12:00]  Human statues.  When people, they put on the green makeup.  They put the weight, the weight style.  They freeze, yeah.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  So there was one in Australia, and this kid knew that he was a human statue, so he tried  to be one of those, you know, those pestering, so eventually, after touching him all over  the place, nothing inappropriate, he gave him a wet, well, you know, one of these things  in the ear.  I hate those.  So the statue broke form, okay?  The statue got up off the pedestal, punched the guy right in the mouth, broke his jaw, 
[02:12:30]  and knocked all of his teeth out, you know what I mean?  So what I would like to do is, at this point...  That's a lie.  We've seen the video.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That he doesn't knock all of his teeth out or break his jaw or get off a pedestal.  No.  No, those incidents didn't happen.  You saw the video, right?  I did.  He hit the guy.  He just threw the punch and hit him, and the guy walks away.  Wait, he's pumping up the story a little bit?  And a little spice to it?  And there was a seven-hand, and he was running with the seven-hand, and there was  a seven-hand, and there was a child suicide bobber. 
[02:13:00]  We've got to punch...  Whatever.  Why don't you show the video?  You don't know what I mean?  Maybe he is.  Maybe...  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  Does he show videos?  No.  He's a show.  He too.  Let's see.  They don't want to take anything away from Scorch Time.  I got up off the pedestal, punched the guy right in the mouth, broke his jaw, and knocked  all of his teeth out, you know what I mean?  So, what I would like to do is, at this point, I would like to issue the very first, or the  very first, rather, Scorch's PFG-TV Listener-Viewer Challenge. 
[02:13:30]  Hold on, Mark.  Go back.  Listen to the applause.  The worst...  Wow.  Wow.  The worst applause introduction ever.  First of all, it's so fake.  And the applause started too early.  They piped it right.  It's early.  And they started before...  Like, who would applaud?  Which makes it more noticeable.  The entire audience started applauding at the exact same time where they shouldn't have.  You gotta cue that shit up better.  This is hilariously bad. 
[02:14:00]  We got applause, James.  Let's hear that again, please.  I would like to do is, at this point, I would like to issue the very first, or the very first,  rather, Scorch's PFG-TV Listener-Viewer Challenge.  Like, pause.  They're applauding because he said PFG-TV, basically.  If they applauded at the end of the setup, then it would kind of work.  Listen to that again.  No crowd would just all start applauding at that point. 
[02:14:30]  All of his teeth out, you know what I mean?  So, what I would like to do is, at this point, I would like to issue the very first, or the very first, rather,  Scorch's PFG-TV Listener-Viewer Challenge.  No, now, applause.  You wait.  Oh, my God.  Because there's an anticipation thing there, too.  They applaud after what they're applauding has been stated.  Yes.  Yes.  And this is like applause you would hear at, like, Radio City.  Yeah.  All right.  With a full crowd at Radio City. 
[02:15:00]  The Rockettes.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, uh...  It's the same gusto.  I love when they look out at the fake audience that's not there.  Yeah, he's looking out at the fake audience.  There's not an audience there.  No.  This should be viral.  This show should be viral.  Oh, my God, yes.  This should have millions of views.  Millions.  Yeah.  I told you they like me.  Phew.  All right.  Within the next two weeks...  Did you catch that edit? 
[02:15:30]  Wow.  Oh, he fucked it up, so they had to redo it?  Yeah, you can see completely...  Let's see.  Wow.  Wait, man.  This is a challenge, though.  This is cut.  We're ready to hear the first PFG TV challenge.  We're making people wait for it.  Mm-hmm.  Psyched.  ...issue the very first...  Or the very first, rather...  Scorch's PFG TV Listener Viewer Challenge!  That's when you hit the applause.  Right on the challenge.  Within the next two weeks after seeing this show, I am going to be somewhere in downtown 
[02:16:00]  Boston as a human statue.  Whoa.  So, here's the challenge.  Oh, no.  You have to punch every single statue that you see from now to the next two weeks in downtown  Boston.  It laughs.  If you are the lucky one to punch me...  It's Rupert Pumpkin.  ...I won't punch you back, but you're going to get a huge, huge special prize that the Scorch's  PFG TV lawyers are working on getting us right now.  As we speak.  As we speak. 
[02:16:30]  So, make sure you punch every statue you see.  Everyone.  You can get the grand prize, folks.  Yeah!  Yeah!  But...  But...  But there's no...  But what's the...  He didn't say what the prize was.  Right.  But do you understand what a lawsuit that is waiting to happen?  I know, but if you're going to have a contest, you've got to get everything figured out.  Dude, the laughter that was piped in...  That was fake?  The fucking...  The laughs were real.  The no grand prize, grand prize...  The lawyers are working on it.  The fucking...  What lawyers?  You've got to...  No one's working on it.  Exactly.  There are PFG TV lawyers. 
[02:17:00]  But they should have the prize already if they're going with the contest.  Do you think that, uh...  Holy shit.  If a statue got punched in the face and somebody said PFG TV told me to do it, the person with  the statue would have a legal case against Scorch?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He set himself up for a lawsuit.  I cannot get enough of Scorch.  This is fantastic.  It's amazing.  Let's hear more, please.  We're on in the middle of the night, and a lot of people have just been drinking as 
[02:17:30]  they watch the show.  So you know what?  We're not really going to give you any prize, but I guarantee you some people are still going  to go out and punch in the stage.  Stop punching.  Hell yeah.  Those are our listeners.  We love you.  Those are our listeners.  The world's strongest cause again.  Oh, my God, was that bad applause.  Who does this?  They do this on their home computer?  It's really bad.  They're just sweetening the audience a little bit.  Just pumping it up a little, right?  A little bit.  Just a little bit.  You know what?  We're not really going to give you any prize, but I guarantee you some people are still going 
[02:18:00]  to go around and punch in the stage.  Stop punching.  Hell yeah.  Those are our listeners.  We love you.  Those are our listeners.  The world's strongest cup of coffee, Death Wish Coffee.  Have you heard about that?  I just heard about that.  Brand new.  You just heard about it.  When?  Last week.  Tell us about Death Wish Coffee.  Okay.  This guy's Death Wish Coffee.  He's got...  That's so awkward.  There's no chemistry here.  Not an iota.  Is it a sponsor?  Are they trying to get into one of those?  I don't know. 
[02:18:30]  That would be like...  The show's a mystery.  If Jay Leno was doing headlines and he asked the band leader, you heard about this?  The band leader was like, yes.  And then Jay was like, oh, I did...  I'll give a pass.  You tell him then.  I'll give a pass if this is a sponsored thing.  I don't care.  I just had a tough time working it in.  This is fucking funny, though.  You like it?  Fuck yeah, man.  This guy, you hear the audience are going crazy.  Yeah.  My band's supposed to be on. 
[02:19:00]  The skull and crossbones.  All right?  And he's made a challenge to everybody else.  This is the strongest cup of coffee you're ever going to drink.  I saw 600 milligrams of caffeine.  All right?  See, I don't...  I wonder...  Paul...  Now, what a non-idiot would say is this is how many are in a regular cup of coffee.  Right, right.  So that we...  He gives no basis of what that is. 
[02:19:30]  I still don't know how strong it is.  For all I know, a regular cup of coffee has 610.  Right.  Or is it three?  Exactly.  I don't know.  I wish a non-idiot had given that description.  It's really good.  Wow.  600 milligrams of caffeine.  Shh.  All right?  See, I don't...  I'm one...  In the world of hallucinogens, I like downs, not ups.  Do you like being that up?  The syndrome that you have.  I do one cup of...  They're the real thing a day.  Then I'm like... 
[02:20:00]  One cup a day gets me going to the...  Kodunkaflunk.  Whatever he calls the toilet.  In that up.  Nah, I do one cup of...  They're the real thing a day.  And then I'm like, I'm wired.  This thing has the strength of...  Maybe the pills.  Double the strength of espresso.  And it comes with a disclaimer.  Warning the drinkers, believe it or not, to have many sleepless nights.  Okay?  I mean, that's insane.  You can get it on Amazon right now.  Auremberg rallies flags behind him without the slots.  $16.  It looks very Nazi-like, the black, red, and white. 
[02:20:30]  Nazi, because you should not see this.  Then he has like a red couch that blends in with the red in the back.  It's just hideous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Drinkers, believe it or not, to have many sleepless nights.  Okay?  I mean, that's insane.  You can get it on Amazon right now.  $16 or a 16-ounce bag.  $20.  $20.  Huh?  $16-ounce bag?  $16-ounce bag, $20.  I'll give you a 20-ounce bag for $40. 
[02:21:00]  You know what?  We'll talk about that off here.  We can't do this now.  We'll talk about that later.  Oh, that's right.  We're in fucks.  We got one final weird news story.  This is interesting.  It's charmless.  I guess that was a pot reference.  A charmless, terrible joke.  I don't understand what...  I don't think it was set up ahead of time either.  I don't think they discussed that they were going there with that.  That coffee thing wasn't a news story.  No.  It was just explaining that there was coffee on Amazon if you want to buy some.  Oh.  But they needed to go there so they could set up their really good drug joke. 
[02:21:30]  The pot joke?  Yeah.  I mean, it was strong, wasn't it?  It was really strong.  Yeah, it was a good joke, but I mean, it was great.  Yeah.  Christian Erba of Poland, amazing new world record.  This guy drove up, rode his bicycle up 2,754 steps to the top of the Shanghai World Financial  Center.  One hour and 21 minutes.  That's all it took for him to do that.  How about that?  Unbelievable. 
[02:22:00]  You're in good shape.  I wouldn't do that.  I can bike up, you know.  What do you do to stay in shape?  Oh, my God.  He's interviewing his co-host.  They have nothing.  So he finds articles and he goes, okay, then I just rip off this.  And then he got to the end of the article and he went, ah!  Yeah, I got nothing.  There's no wit.  There's nothing here.  You don't think so?  It's devoid of anything.  It's a visual and audio vacuum. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  What do you do?  Ride your bike up, you know.  What do you do to stay in shape?  Play drums.  Oh, so?  Did you ever play it?  What bands have you played in?  Boston.  I played in Hardcore and Boston.  We went Boston.  And Dirty Water.  Dirty Water.  Give it up.  That's the one we wanted.  Yeah, all right.  Anyway, it's a good news, bad news situation.  The good news is...  That's another terrible edit. 
[02:23:00]  The fake fucking...  I love it.  What a set of balls on him.  And then they started the applause early because they thought he was going to say Boston first.  Yeah.  Anyone else pick up on that?  No, they didn't start anything.  The editor hit the button early.  Oh, the guy that was supposed to sweeten it up a little bit?  Sweeten that in post.  Please sweeten it up.  Sweeten up the laughs.  Amazing.  Dirty Water.  Give it up.  That's the one we wanted.  Yeah, all right.  Anyway, it's a good news, bad news situation.  The good news is he did break the record.  Great.  But obviously, as you can tell, the bad news is nobody ever spoke about it. 
[02:23:30]  And that, my friends, is today's installment of Weird News.  Did you get that?  No.  Fucking funny.  Smoked like a bike, you cocksucker.  This guy's fucking good.  That whole thing was a setup.  To say no one spoke about it, but that doesn't make sense.  No, he doesn't.  Holy fuck.  What are you talking about no one spoke of it?  He just did.  I'm stunned.  Yeah?  He went all that distance for a spoke joke. 
[02:24:00]  It's a spoke joke.  Because it was a bike story.  Spokes.  Spoke.  Yeah, spoke.  Spokes.  Wow.  That's good.  Yeah, that's great.  A bike has spokes.  It does.  More, please.  Please.  Please.  What a hell of a show today.  Wow.  Great show.  We've got coming up a great comedian, Steve Sweeney.  We have got Sarah Lakita.  And we're going to be talking about the Arrow Chicks and so much more.  And we have got professional athlete Scott Young coming up right next as we continue with 
[02:24:30]  more of Scorch's PFG TV.  I think he wanted to say right now.  Yes, he wanted to say right now.  Because he realized there's nothing happening.  There's nothing to go to.  So he had to say right next.  Right next.  Did the band set up so they could play for two seconds?  Yeah, let's see the band.  Do they have a band today in this episode?  No.  No.  You couldn't afford the band.  Welcome back to Scorch's PFG TV.  Welcome back.  You didn't go there.  Very special. 
[02:25:00]  Pause.  Right now.  There is a new problem.  I want to see something.  The audio is not synced up with the video.  Now his mouth isn't moving with the sound.  Can we go back to the end of that one and the new beginning?  I want to see something.  Okay.  Just the end and the beginning.  Go ahead.  I want to see if his left hand has moved on that couch at all.  Yeah.  Or if it's exactly in the same position, meaning he just...  Okay, you try it.  You know, that they just...  So much more.  And we have got professional athlete Scott Young coming up right next as we continue with more 
[02:25:30]  of Scorch's PFG TV.  Oh, they clap quick.  Shit.  Okay.  It won't matter.  Welcome back to Scorch's PFG TV.  Very special guest right now.  The guest, a pro hockey player.  No, no, no.  Got a lot of stuff going on.  We can't do this whole thing.  Get right ahead.  We got to do...  Yeah, we got to go to Sweeney.  Go to Sweeney.  I want to hear poor Steve Sweeney's jokes get stepped on by...  Oh, yes.  He will trounce every setup he tries to do.  That's Scott Young. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that's the fucking hockey guy.  Let's see the band.  Let me see where the chick is.  Oh, boy.  A pig.  Oh, my God.  What a thump.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  What does this say?  Wait, wait, wait.  What does this say?  Wait, wait, wait.  He's outside?  Hold on a minute.  I see a car driving.  Oh, no.  They said that for a bit.  Is it a bit?  Is it a bit?  Yeah.  It has to be because Sib is in a robe and he's got a cup of tea or coffee. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  What's happening?  Let's see.  Right.  And it's three younger people in their 30s living with three older people in their 70s.  And one of the commercials, there's a girl in the back seat and the old lady's looking  at the GPS saying, I don't know how to use this damn thing.  And the girl in the back seat is looking at a MacBook saying, I don't know how to use  it.  So, yeah, it's amazing.  You know, times have changed.  What kind of a crowd do you get at an event?  Hopefully the craziest ones. 
[02:27:00]  You know, it's a huge variety of people.  Good to get right there.  Honestly, women, men, young, old.  Fucking Sibby in this.  Sibs vids.  I get the opportunity and I'm honored and privileged to show a video that I've taken somewhere in  this wonderful country of ours, supported by one of the songs that my old band, Ernie  and the Automatics, just released.  I want you to sit back, get your favorite drink, get a smoke, put your feet up, relax, and  enjoy this week's fit. 
[02:27:30]  I'm looking at a beach.  Palm trees.  All shakily taken.  Yeah, it's like a tsunami video.  I wish that's what it was.  It's like a bad music video.  Yeah.  Horrible.  This is driving.  Driving down the road.  I'm in a Caribbean town.  It is good stuff.  Put it in the show. 
[02:28:00]  What is this?  I don't know.  This is a guy driving down the street in like fucking YKK.  It's terrible.  Sibs vids.  Oh my god.  You're still driving.  Why would you cut to something else?  Holy shit.  He's driving in real time.  It's still driving.  It's still pointed out the fucking windshield.  You're showing a nice scene.  You can see a car in front.  He's just on a road.  He's still driving.  Sibs vids are terrible.  It didn't even change again.  No.  It's one long shot out the windshield. 
[02:28:30]  No, no, wait.  At least show the fucking ocean.  You're passing.  He doesn't even show the ocean.  No, I want to see how long he just drives.  It's the camera that's pointed out the windshield.  It's still going.  What the fuck are they doing?  It's hilarious.  It's nothing.  It's absolutely nothing.  It's just a shot out the windshield as he's driving.  And there's nothing to look at. 
[02:29:00]  Nothing.  It's not even a nice area.  No.  Who gives a fuck area down in the Caribbean somewhere?  How careless and sloppy.  There's people on bikes.  What is this?  I don't know what this is.  It's still the same shop, by the way.  Yeah.  Just the camera aimed stupidly out the front window.  You think this would be it?  All right.  Finally, now it's a different road.  A tree-lined suburban area.  At least he made a cut, but he still has the shot out the windshield.  That's it.  This is terrible. 
[02:29:30]  Now he's showing you bushes and houses on the side.  He's just showing a shrub.  He's going by way too fast.  You can't see anything.  Fucking terrible.  Fuck.  Why would Scorch think this would be good for the show?  I don't know.  He almost shows the driver.  Yeah.  You're mad he's showing the knuckle on the fucking steering wheel?  Wow.  Wow.  This is terrible.  What the fuck?  This is terrible.  What is the point of this?  No point. 
[02:30:00]  Oh my God.  All right.  Let's see how they come back to it.  Yeah.  This literally has another two minutes.  What?  Yeah.  Fuck it.  No.  We can't make it there.  Skip over that.  I think that the fucking bands pay money to fucking have their songs played.  Yeah, but he's just driving.  It's Sibs Band.  Oh.  All right.  There's better ways to fucking play the song from your band.  How about you bring the band in?  Let's hear Scorch now.  Coming back.  All right.  All right.  At least he shows a sunset at the end of the thing.  Oh, it's just atrocious.  What the fuck was that?  Welcome back to Scorch's BFG TV. 
[02:30:30]  What a show so far.  What a great show.  They don't acknowledge it.  And we're very much loving the fact we are now on Fox 25.  Oh, Fox.  We're going big time.  And I'm so excited about this.  Our guest.  By the way, Parse, the camera work.  It's on Scorch.  And you see Sibs left hand and watch.  You've got to go one shot or two shot.  You can't have just the guy's left hand and left knee.  And there's so much room to Scorch's side where they can absolutely get both of them in frame.  We're hearing him carry on a conversation with a severed hand. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  What is he going for Stanley Kubrick?  Just fucking making everyone uncomfortable?  What are you doing?  He's terrible.  Do you think Scorch's notes are secretly tucked away?  Maybe.  Or are they just shoved into the couch?  Shoved into the couch.  I got to pee badly.  I'm going to run and pee.  Oh.  What?  No.  I have to pee.  I can't hold.  How long since we broke?  Little Jimmy.  I got to piss desperately.  All right.  So why don't we do a quick break?  I can't hold.  And then we'll do the Steve Sweeney thing.  I want to move on to all the shit.  That sounds good. 
[02:31:30]  That sounds good.  OPN Anthony.  This is the OPN Anthony Show.  That's so true.  We went to the bathroom.  And the PFG TV with Scorch just is making me mad.  Everyone gets mad just talking about, like, what's wrong with it.  Well, they set up Sib's video.  Yeah.  And you're thinking, okay, cool.  He's going to show a cool video or something.  And they, I mean, the setup was so long. 
[02:32:00]  And he has a wardrobe change and everything to set up his video.  And then it's just a shot out of windshield for four minutes.  Yeah.  Terrible.  What the fuck was that?  And now we're looking at an almost two shot.  You can't have an almost two shot of the business.  You either have a one shot or a two shot.  You don't have a one shot with the guy's left hand and left knee in the picture.  Especially when you're talking to that guy.  Right.  Like, then you hear his voice, but you don't see him.  You see all of Scorch, and you see a left hand and a knee right now. 
[02:32:30]  That's it.  Fuck, this is enraging.  Where are we at?  Where did we leave off?  Oh, we want Sweeney.  Yeah, we want Sweeney, then we'll move on as far as this goes for a while.  Oh, wow.  Oldest comedians ever.  Aristophanes actually got lines from this guy.  Many different kinds of lines, including comedy lines.  This is our pal Steve Sweeney.  Oh, yeah.  That's what's the BFG TV.  Hi-oh.  Rewind.  Rewind.  Rewind. 
[02:33:00]  Watch them stand up out of frame.  Really?  Did they stand up to clap for Steve Sweeney?  Their heads are out of frame.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  Come on.  Watch them.  This is basic TV production.  Oh, this is great.  Literally basic shit.  There we go.  All right, go ahead.  Actually got lines from this guy.  Many different kinds of lines, including comedy lines.  This is our pal Steve Sweeney.  Oh, yeah.  You're just looking at his crotch. 
[02:33:30]  Are you trying to say that never happens on Leno, Jimmy?  No.  Never?  Half of Scorch is showing, and one quarter of Sib is showing as they stand up to greet the guest who is coming out.  The big guest.  Wow.  Steve Sweeney.  All right.  The great Steve Sweeney.  Let her rip.  What is this? 
[02:34:00]  That's good.  This is the future.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  What an introduction.  This is the future of the speech.  Yeah, you know, I've done over.  Let me tell you something, all right?  Since I got that introduction from Scorch's P-I-S-S show.  I've done over 20-something movies, something about Mary, me, myself, and Irene.  And, yeah, you know, no one could be madder at me the way my career has ended up.  In the third floor of a freaking abandoned building in Framingham with a bald-headed host from freaking New Hampshire. 
[02:34:30]  Sibby, I'm surprised at you putting a knife in me.  I'm sad.  These are called feelings.  What's your name, Scorch?  Yeah, you can come whenever you want, man.  You're the superstar of the guy.  But anyway, I take what I can get.  You shouldn't make fun of old people.  I've been very depressed, if you want to know the truth.  Why is that?  Well, I don't want to get to the cause of the depression, but what I did was I went to a veterinarian the other day. 
[02:35:00]  And the guy said, where's your dog?  I said, my apartment's too small.  It wouldn't be fair to the dog.  He said, so what are you doing here?  I said, I want you to put me to sleep.  He said, what?  I said, you know, I want you to put me down.  So he said, what are you, crazy?  I said, do I look crazy?  Do I?  Do I look crazy?  I look like those guys you run away from in the subway.  So he said, so you're not going to do it? 
[02:35:30]  He said, no.  I said, of course.  I said, so will you fix me?  And he said, fix me, you know, neuter me, you know.  He said, this is what he said to me, Sib, and I know you're a dog lover.  He said, you're a little mangy.  So what I'll do is I'll groom you.  So he gave me a chew toy.  And anyway, listen, I am here, you know, because you were talking about, you know, your love  of animals or whatever you're lying about. 
[02:36:00]  Wow.  You hear what he just said or whatever you were lying about.  This is really uncomfortable.  Steve Sweeney hates him.  It looks like they don't know each other.  Yeah, and Steve Sweeney realized he got himself into something.  He's like, what is this?  He was probably lied to.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Fox 25.  He airs on Fox 25.  We got 20 million viewers worldwide.  Oh, my God.  I'm in so fucking.  Yeah, you can tell he's not into this at all.  No.  He's like, what the fuck is this? 
[02:36:30]  Rewind a little bit so you can hear him say a lie.  What else you're lying about?  Neuter me, you know.  He said, this is what he said to me, Sib, and I know you're a dog.  He said, you're a little mangy.  The story goes nowhere.  So what I'll do is I'll groom you.  So he gave me a chew toy.  Anyway, listen.  I am here.  He won't even look at school enough.  You know, because you were talking about, you know, your love of animals or whatever you're lying about. 
[02:37:00]  I am here for a very special cause that I'm involved in.  I am running a 10K Sunday for the restless leg syndrome.  And as you can see, they're very restless.  And I also am afflicted.  And I know this is just comedy to you people with the irritable bowel syndrome.  So I try to crap, Sibby.  And I can't because my legs are so restless.  It's very sad. 
[02:37:30]  And then there's a million man march in Washington, of course, for erectile dysfunction.  And we are going to march, Sib, and I hope to see you there.  All right.  So, listen.  I've been waiting two hours.  Start firing some questions at me.  Pause.  Why wait in two hours if it's live and we're only 50 minutes in?  Because we'll probably keep retaking stuff.  Wow.  You can see Steve Sweeney is miserable being there.  Yeah, yeah.  He is not enjoying this.  He's not a happy man.  I don't blame him. 
[02:38:00]  Being in that studio.  He was one of the guys.  I told you, one of the guys I beat out for Lucky Lily.  Oh, wow.  It was me, him, and one of the guys.  It's the only time I've met him.  Yeah, I liked him, though.  He's obviously a very funny dude.  He's a very funny guy.  But you can tell he just fucking wants nothing to do with this.  I wonder what it was about.  He probably waited too long.  He was probably annoyed and Scorch put him on last.  Right.  He's the biggest of those guests.  Oh, he should be up front.  Oh, boy.  No one's still watching this video.  Only us.  Because we're obsessed with it.  72 views.  Good. 
[02:38:30]  And we're going to march, Sib, and I hope to see you there.  All right, so listen, I've been waiting two hours.  Start firing some questions at me so I can get out of here.  All right, first question, how are your two dogs going?  I love your two dogs.  I've got two great dogs, and I also have a good friend named Sibby,  Sibby, who is absolutely, out of millions of men, the worst loser on the golf course.  He pouts, he storms off, and he takes my money all the time. 
[02:39:00]  Now, wait a minute.  How do you lose?  I know.  And it takes somebody's money.  I mean, the one time you've lost, and he's living off The Rock.  His daughter is with The Rock.  We don't tell people that.  The Rock is sending him money.  And now we owe the WWE money for mentioning him.  Now, a lot of late-night hosts do use toothpicks,  and I know that you're starting a trend with that.  Yes.  No, anyway, I've been watching this show.  It's a great show.  That's it.  Is my segment over? 
[02:39:30]  Jesus.  No, you know what?  Can I relay a funny story?  Yeah, go ahead.  With me and Steve?  Yeah.  Because we go way back.  I mean, I was a big fan of his, you know, going to shows,  and he'd see me and give me these looks, you know.  Yeah.  Then I'd see him, and a couple weeks later, finally he goes,  you know what?  I said, I think this guy's connected.  You know, he thought, and I finally introduced myself.  And we've been golfing buddies for the longest time,  but we also were judges on the community audition show.  Yeah.  Right.  What?  And one of the years, a couple years ago, 
[02:40:00]  Steve was on the final show,  and I was really disappointed with the selection they made.  Right.  And just to give you some legs,  I sang harmony with Brad Delp on two world tours.  I sang on record and live with Sammy Hager,  and I also sang live on a record with Rick Derringer.  So I like to think I know what I'm saying about vocals.  Right.  Anyway, I wasn't really happy with the selection they made  for the grand prize winner.  So I call up Steve, and I go, 
[02:40:30]  Steve, I go, what the hell's going on?  Yeah, great story so far.  How did you pick her?  What are you, out of your freaking mind?  You know, don't you know anything?  Right.  And he says, you know what he says to me?  He says, go f*** yourself.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And he hangs up the phone.  So I waited a couple of weeks.  Yeah.  I call him back.  I go, hey, Steve, hi, this is Sibby.  You know what?  I already did go f*** myself, and it was good.  Well, and I said, let me finish.  And I said, can we go off later on today? 
[02:41:00]  He goes, sure.  So you know what?  That's a good friend.  You can tell your buddy to go screw.  Holy shit.  Well, let me tell you my version of the story.  That's not a story.  Because as you know,  I sang harmony with John Lennon and Paul McCartney.  That's right.  Look, I'm the first to admit that I don't know anything about music.  I wish he was singing with Bradley Dump while the barbecue was going.  But what Sibby does is he takes these 12, 13-year-old children,  and he crushes their self-esteem. 
[02:41:30]  They're sitting there wide-eyed in innocent little faces.  And they'll look at them and say,  Think about Walmarts!  And then the parents will come up the afterwards.  Am I supposed to get this?  I love doing this show, but the parents will.  I don't get this.  I don't get this.  I don't get it.  I'm hearing people talking.  This isn't fun anymore.  But I'm not understanding what the f*** they're even talking about.  This is excellent.  I want to hear more.  Oh, God.  Really?  It's cringy, yeah.  Poor Steve Sweeney.  It's not fun anymore.  But even Steve Sweeney, I understand he's pissed, 
[02:42:00]  but I don't even know what he's talking about.  Scorch, thank God, has just shut up.  Right.  He hasn't said a word, and fucking, you know,  that magic story Sibby told, wow.  I'm not having fun anymore.  No.  No, no, I'm just mad.  Well, that's where we bought company.  I'm enjoying this quite a great deal.  I got mad in the bathroom with the video out the windshield.  It's, yeah.  I don't know what that was.  Sibby's vids?  Sibs vids?  Sibs vids?  What is he talking about? 
[02:42:30]  Sibs vibs?  Sibs vibs.  Sibs vibs.  Please, more of this uncomfortable interview.  Really?  Dude, I've never heard an interview that made me this uncomfortable.  Come up to you and, uh...  Do you know how old my daughter is?  I don't know, 14?  Yeah, she's only 14.  Why don't you give her a 10?  You know, so, yeah, you're right, Sib.  I should have...  That's all right.  You won.  You know what?  No, you know what?  No, no, no.  I got kicked off.  No, no, no.  You know what? 
[02:43:00]  I voted for the person that you liked on that, but I was overruled by Joyce Colhaywood.  So you can tell her to go after herself.  Well, I got kicked off because they had some nasty rumors about me and Joyce in the back  room, and, you know, so I'm gone.  Oh, so my rumors worked.  But you know what?  Wow.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  This show, I mean, the momentum it's gotten. 
[02:43:30]  Anyway...  Can I ask you one question?  I actually have been in the biggest movies of the summer, twice.  Oh, my God.  He hates Scorch because he won't even look at him.  Jesus.  There's nothing better than an inside story, first of all.  I love it.  And then, like, the quality of the video went from really light to dark.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He does hate Scorch.  He hates him.  He won't even look at him.  You can see he's not looking at Scorch.  He's pissed because he was sold a bag of goods here. 
[02:44:00]  He was sold something that this isn't.  What was he told this show was?  I don't know.  Probably anything but terrible.  It's a talk show on Fox 25.  He was told a number of listeners.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a lot of fucking viewers.  He was given a number.  I mean, yeah, that's why I meant viewers.  He was given a number, though.  Like, whether it's 100,000 or a million or something impressive.  Sib, you know, Sibby is the co-host.  He said there's a big YouTube friend of yours.  Why don't Scorch like Sib? 
[02:44:30]  Come on.  Get some of your celebrity friends.  We need a big get.  Do you think Scorch is annoyed right now that Sib is getting to do this on his own?  No, he's clueless.  Scorch the app doing a great job.  Scorch doesn't care.  He's just sitting there going, this is great.  Amazing.  All right, a little more.  Really?  A stellar movie career.  I actually have been in the biggest movies of the summer, twice.  Back to School, if anyone remembers that, and Something About Mary.  Right.  And I was in Me, Myself, and Irene. 
[02:45:00]  And I just did one called The Makeover.  It was on ABC.  It sucked.  And my parts sucked.  But I've done a lot of independent movies, and I'm producing two things for Showtime and Comedy Central.  So I met, like, an executive.  Hey, don't mention the other networks.  You guys have an executive producer.  Yeah.  And, you know, he's dressed worse than I am.  Yeah.  And now I'm an executive producer.  There you go.  So.  You know, the question I got about it.  Yes.  And, uh, what's it?  Uh, Something About Mary.  Yes.  Was it real? 
[02:45:30]  Classic scene.  Was it real?  Exactly.  You know, they cut that out on TV all the time.  Do they?  Yeah.  No, my wife doesn't even think it's part of the show.  Right.  But they have this scene where every guy's done it, accidentally zipped up his, uh, his  pack, his, uh, nutsack there, or whatever.  Yeah.  And, uh.  And it's, and they show that in the movie.  Right?  Well.  What was that?  It wasn't Ben Stiller's thing.  Oh, my God.  Was it your, was it your package?  No.  Let me.  Was it your package?  I love the accents.  Holy shit.  Here's the best part of that whole thing.  Here's the best part of this whole thing. 
[02:46:00]  Wow.  Wow.  God-awful exchange.  Yeah.  Steve Sweeney wants to commit a murder.  He's being nice to this guy because he plays golf with him.  Yeah.  He wants Scorch to die of cancer.  But here's the thing.  Scorch is so left out of this, and he knows it.  At least he's smart enough to shut up.  Huh.  But he wants to be a part of it, so when Sibby says something about zipping up, Scorch,  just to get in the mix going, he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he.  Please, please listen to Scorch's in the movie.  Oh, he's too-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he.  And you know he's now mad at Sib? 
[02:46:30]  Oh, he's just-  Because Sib got him involved in this nonsense.  Scorch doesn't know this is a bad segment.  He just knows he's uncomfortable.  And this will probably ruin their friendship.  Oh, yeah.  Not at first.  Maybe we're going to see a new co-host.  Right.  No, it's going to ruin Sib and Sweeney.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because Sweeney goes, what the fuck?  What did you get me involved with here?  That's going to come out, I'm telling you.  Yep.  Right?  What was that?  It wasn't Ben Stiller's thing.  Was it your package?  No, let me...  Here we go.  The scene where every guy's done it, accidentally zipped up his pack, his nutsack there, or whatever. 
[02:47:00]  And they show that in the movie, right?  What was that?  What was that?  Hold on, we're missing something else.  It's called a fucking, like, a prop, you dunce.  Yeah, there's no reason...  Exactly, that wasn't a hamburger on the hibachi.  What was it?  Your friend's head.  Let's go to Chucky in Queens.  Chucky's in love.  What's up, Chucky?  I can't get enough of it. 
[02:47:30]  It's unbelievable.  I'm obsessed.  Well, I was asking Jimmy in the bathroom, like, I don't even know if this makes good radio.  I don't know.  I just get mad.  I'm obsessed with it.  I don't know if I'm outnumbered out there, but keep it going.  All right.  Fair enough.  Let me tell you something.  In the very beginning, you guys were cracking up about the physical shot, how he took himself  out of the camera shot, but you missed a line when he was like, we waited in many comedy  lines, but those weren't the only lines.  Like, make an awful joke.  I caught that, but it was just one more in a sea of terrible jokes. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, my God.  Classic Scorch.  Keep it up, boys.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Welcome to Sweeney.  Play a little more.  I'm going to believe the one guy.  This is terrible.  I'm going to believe the one guy that this is working.  And Steve Sweeney's not even enjoying it.  I mean, he's having a miserable time.  No.  He's putting no effort into it.  He just wants to go home.  Because he opens up with, I've been depressed.  I'm not going to go in for the reason for the depression.  I would love to have talked about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to push him on that.  Oh, Scorch doesn't care.  The scene where every guy's done it, accidentally zipped up his pack, his nutsack there, or whatever. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  And they show that in the movie, right?  What was that?  It wasn't Ben Stiller's thing.  Was it your package?  Yeah.  No.  Let me.  Wow.  The level of questioning on the show is outstanding.  Let me just.  I don't like to get into this, but.  It's the level of questioning.  The level of questioning on the show is outstanding.  You know, little Scorch, I would have handled this a little differently.  You know that, right?  It's all right, Scorch.  Sit back.  They all know.  All right.  I'm going to hang back. 
[02:49:00]  Sometimes you shine brightest when you're just sitting back.  You sure?  He knows.  No, he doesn't.  He hates Scorch.  Hates him.  Who does?  What's his name?  The comedian.  Steve Sweeney.  He's a legend.  Steve Sweeney's a legend.  Scorch is sitting there trying to include himself, and Steve Sweeney, he paused for a second.  But then when you realize Scorch was just talking, he just started talking over him.  I want to just get guests that were on this show now.  Yep.  That's what I'm saying.  That's all I want to do.  I get it now.  I want Steve Sweeney.  Can we get him on the phone? 
[02:49:30]  Because I want to know why.  He is so mad.  So if something went down, he realized probably when he showed up, like, what the fuck?  This isn't a big TV show.  Let's work on getting Steve Sweeney on the phone.  I'd love to talk to him.  Right?  Well, what was that?  It wasn't Ben Stiller's thing.  Was it your package?  No.  Let me.  Wow.  See, the level of questioning on this show is outstanding.  Let me just, I don't like to get into this, but I am going to take a moment to talk about  my package. 
[02:50:00]  When women see me naked, they always say the same thing.  I can't believe you're white.  Anyway, this is why, as I mentioned earlier, erectile dysfunction is such an important issue.  Steve, I don't get that.  I know.  But you're from New Hampshire.  I'll do it slow.  Hey, listen, I know we go out to New Hampshire. 
[02:50:30]  You New Hampshire people, I go into New Hampshire.  At the top of the sign, Stevie, it says, welcome to New Hampshire.  Bienvenue.  At the bottom, it says, bienvenue.  I've been to New Hampshire a number of times.  No one's ever come up to me and said, oh, bonjour, monsieur.  Comment allez-vous bienvenue?  It's more like that.  There's a Bayard over there.  But I want to congratulate the people of New Hampshire on that.  Can you look at this highway there?  Yeah.  What is it?  Kanga Mangas Highway.  That is a... 
[02:51:00]  I like your version better.  This is your show.  I should be looking at you.  No, it's okay.  I don't want to look at you.  Go ahead.  Look at you.  I was on Letterman, and people say, how was it?  I said, I don't remember.  I just did it.  You know, it's kind of like the 80s.  Right.  If you were there, you know.  But I've had a...  One of the best things about this business...  Steve reminds me right now.  So bad.  This is...  It seems like a comedian coming unraveled.  And it's like, there's so much interesting stuff to talk to this guy about. 
[02:51:30]  Because he is a legend in Boston.  And he's a really solid actor.  And he's got some bitterness to him, which is great.  There's something there that he really seems depressed about.  Right.  Like, why wouldn't you want to...  He didn't want to go into it, but why not just have a real conversation with him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would much rather hear that.  Of course.  You feel the same way, because we've had a lot of conversations.  I have worked with people in my field that were my heroes.  I worked with George Carlin. 
[02:52:00]  Unbelievable.  I followed Richard Pryor at the Comedy Store.  I was good friends with Rodney Dangerfield.  So, you know, now that I have one foot in the grave...  Sidney's impression was really good.  This is why he's the co-host.  Sidney did a Rodney impression.  He kind of pulled at the neck of his shirt.  Black vest.  That was either, yeah, Rodney Dangerfield or Frankenstein.  See, no, it was... 
[02:52:30]  It was fucking Omar.  As he went thrown into the helicopter.  What the fuck?  You expect me to believe Sibby was a co-host?  Because Sibby said something.  Sibby said something.  Let's hear the Rodney impression.  Yeah, that's great.  It's great.  With people in my field that were my heroes.  I worked with George Carlin.  Unbelievable.  I followed Richard Pryor at the Comedy Store.  I was good friends with Rodney Dangerfield. 
[02:53:00]  So, you know, now that I have one foot in the grave, I...  You're here on our show.  Thank you.  You know, getting back to death, because it's so important to talk about this.  I...  This is what I want to do.  What do they call it when they burn you?  Cremate.  Hire you.  They cremate you.  Do you still?  I've never seen them this focused.  Anyway.  So, this is what I want to do.  Sarah, by the way, great music.  He sounds like a guy... 
[02:53:30]  He sounds like a guy ready to commit suicide.  Yeah, absolutely.  Steve Sweeney sounds like he...  Unless this is a total put-on.  No, he's mad about...  He sounds like a very sad guy right now who is ready to commit suicide.  Because he's probably sitting there going, this is what it's come down to.  I'm doing a public access TV that's on in the middle of the fucking night.  That's pretty much it.  And he thought it was going to be something else, so he's probably excited going into it.  Wow.  He sounds really depressed.  Yeah.  Something going on there.  Great music. 
[02:54:00]  So, I want them to cremate me, get my ashes, put them in an ashtray, dump them on a carpet,  and I want David Oreck himself with his latest vacuum cleaner to vacuum me up.  What do you think?  I would like to see you get sucked up by an Oreck.  That's going to be kind of cool, yes.  We started out on the wrong foot.  So, now...  Yes.  You've been on Letterman.  You've been in some of these movies.  Now, you've made it to the top, so your career is actually getting better as you're getting older. 
[02:54:30]  Where do we go to?  All over the place.  We go to seven, eight, ten homes now that are on fire.  Ten.  So, we're going as far as west as Wayland and as far east as Waltham, something like that?  We're going from Quincy to Hull, and then maybe from Quincy to Dorchester.  Okay.  So, we get a good signal, yeah.  Well, for those of you who ever...  You know, I know there's a big difference.  The South Shore and the North Shore.  They act like it's Germany.  There should be like a wall.  It's like there's not that much difference, I hate to tell you.  But anyway, Quincy is the home not only of two presidents, 
[02:55:00]  but it is the greatest place in the world for an emergency manicure, pedicure, or massage.  You know, this audience sucks.  I'm going to tell you right now.  This is a material.  This is a stuff.  Oh, man, I know.  The only one laughing is the executive producer.  He looks like a homeless guy.  But I like him.  So, this has been a real thrill. 
[02:55:30]  I have absolutely nothing to plug.  Oh, yes, I do.  This is Fox, right?  Yes.  Right.  I have a show that's coming on on Fox.  It's going to be on Sundays.  I am the host.  It's a reality show, Sibby.  It's called Catch an Illegal Alien.  Now, we are shooting them at Home Depots all over the country.  Now, this is how the show works.  One guy runs up the aisle, you know,  and you go by the usual guy that gives you directions at Home Depot. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, yeah, I don't know where it is.  And if you catch the illegal alien before the other guy,  you and your family get a trip to his country of origin.  So, you can go to the Dominican Republic, you know, Guatemala.  We're very excited.  So, this is it.  The end of my life. 
[02:56:30]  Thank you for witnessing it.  Oh, by the way, Sibby.  I was very disappointed because, I hope I can get through this,  I really thought I had a shot at being the Pope.  Oh.  Yeah, I would have liked the hat, the slippers, the Pope mobile.  Get up there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If I were Pope, here's what I'm doing.  I'm bringing back two places that you kids don't know about.  But I remember them growing up.  They're called Purgatory and Limbo. 
[02:57:00]  Kind of a Malden Everett feel to them.  Now, Limbo was your soul.  It's just kind of rocketed.  It's kind of the NASA program.  Now, Purgatory, God looks at your life and says,  Sib, come on, you've been a dick.  Right.  Sorry, God.  But I'm not sending him to Limbo.  So, you're going to stay in Everett for a while.  Oh, man, you know what?  Hey, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Come back on again. 
[02:57:30]  All right, thank you.  You've got to give it up.  It's Tweeny Tweeney from Tweeney Playhouse.  How was that?  Was that very interesting?  That was good.  There you go.  Steve Sweeney on Scorch's PFG TV.  We're coming back.  We're going to close out our very first made-for-Fox TV show on Scorch's PFG TV.  We're coming right back.  Oh, God.  Wow.  So, that wraps up our very first made-for-Fox TV show.  I want to thank our special guests, Sarah and Lisa.  Sarah Laquita and Lisa Dario. 
[02:58:00]  You can't forget about them.  Scott Young, Olympic player, professional hockey player, and so much more.  And, of course, the one and only.  Steve Sweeney, thank you all for coming out to the show.  It was a great show.  Starting next week.  I had a ball.  Next week, we're going to talk to you about the PFG spot.  Now, you might be able to come one of the Hotties, one of Scorch's Hotties on the PFG spot.  So, for now, for my pal Sibby and for myself, check out Scorch's PFG TV.com for everything else.  We'll see you next week right here live on Fox 25. 
[02:58:30]  See you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  And the SNL music.  Yeah, you can't do that.  Fox wouldn't allow that.  It's not made for Fox.  Fox doesn't even know he's doing this.  I don't know what to say anymore about Scorch.  I do.  Yuck.  It was fun, but then it just gets sad.  It's just so terrible. 
[02:59:00]  Ah, well, I guess he's very happy with what he's doing.  Good for him.  Is that something?  Is Steve Sweeney on Twitter?  I hope so.  I would assume so.  Yeah, I definitely want to hear the behind the scenes.  Oh, God, do I.  I want to hear what's happening behind the cameras.  Yes.  I want to hear how big the audience is.  I want to hear what the problems were with Scorch.  If he's still speaking at all with Sibby.  Yeah, he's got to be mad at Sibby for getting him involved with that. 
[02:59:30]  Jesus.  All right.  We're going to take a break and wrap up our show after these messages.  The Opie and Anthony show continues in moments, in moments, in moments, in moments, in moments, in moments.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony. 
[03:00:00]  Hey.  Hey, I'm leaving.  All right.  Go home.  Everybody have fun.  You're fired.  I'm going to be, you're feared.  You're faking.  I'm going to be, um, in bed with some NyQuil.  Nice.  It's like drugs.  Go home.  Go home.  Go home.  You don't have a card.  Go home.  Have shekel soup.  Aren't we leaving too?  Isn't it time? 
[03:00:30]  Or some graps.  Graps.  Oh, great.  It's terrible.  I know everybody hates it, but I can't stop.  Well, I just don't know how to talk to the guy.  Well, this was fun.  This was fun today?  Yeah.  Did you see me on Twitter?  No.  None of these guys are on Twitter?  Now that I see.  Oh.  Who got a WrestleMania hoodie?  Thank you, Sam.  What?  What do you mean?  I bitched Sam with my fist into giving me a WrestleMania hoodie.  I threatened him and he gave me one.  How'd you get one?  I wanted one. 
[03:01:00]  I kind of like this one a lot, actually.  How'd you get one for him?  I make it happen.  Do they have them from WrestleMania 1?  I bet you those are worth money.  I mean, they exist.  They do exist?  Sweatshirts?  I don't know.  Look for WrestleMania 1 stuff quickly before we go.  All right.  Do it now on eBay!  Why are you yelling?  Would you hate me if I became obsessed with wrestling, but all I did was just talk about  the big matches?  Like, I didn't know anything about, like, Count the Rock, right?  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Have you just got annoying?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we've done enough wrestling talk for one day.  I think so, too. 
[03:01:30]  We've done enough talking for one day.  I'm just curious, because I don't like Jimmy Snuka shirts.  You want a Jimmy Snuka shirt?  Yeah, I do.  Why Jimmy Snuka?  Because I like him.  He's my favorite wrestler.  He is your favorite wrestler?  I thought it was Bob Beck.  Oh, I meant Beck.  You don't even remember who your favorite wrestler is.  There you go.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I think we did it for a Monday.  You bet we did.  You're welcome, people.  Yeah, I hope they're happy out there.  If not, I'm sure they'll let us know.  Tee hee.  Hey, Jimmy, Caroline's this weekend. 
[03:02:00]  Let's not forget.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  I am there Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  So I'm looking forward to it.  Good.  Let's go to the gym.  And look at Naked Guys and the blonde with the nice hiney.  And...  Let's go there and sniff it.  Let's get vegetable juices.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And...  And that's that.  And thank you all very much.  Yeah, we'll do this again tomorrow.  Sam's next. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I was just told, and Eric, this is legit.  I heard it, too.  You heard it, okay.  On his way out, I was told, I have two...  On Opie's way out.  Here on After Opie and Anthony Live today.  But first you said, who wants...  I was told that I have two very special prizes to give away.  So you can call up if you want.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  And we can figure out some way to give them both prizes to the person who deserves them the most. 
[03:03:00]  The first prize is, of course, dated April 8th, 2013.  Completed.  Greg Opie Hughes' Sudoku puzzle.  So he signed.  Successfully completed.  Doing Scorch?  Probably.  While the show was on.  Yeah, he let Scorch and PFG TV do the heavy lifting.  And while that was going on, yeah, Opie was able to complete an entire Sudoku puzzle.  And the really nice thing about these Sudoku puzzles is that they come with extra laughs. 
[03:03:30]  Because Sudoku is located right on the funny pages.  So you'll get a little zits.  Jump start.  Hagar the Horrible.  There's even...  What's down here?  Red and Rover.  Doonesbury.  All that.  Complete.  With the Sudoku puzzle.  The second prize.  And this is the prize that was just very aggressively thrown back in my face.  Which I don't understand.  I try.  I apologize. 
[03:04:00]  It wasn't supposed to hit you in the face.  I was just throwing it back over to you.  You're just showing your aggression.  That aggression wasn't meant towards me.  No, it wasn't meant towards you.  Because the second prize is a gift intended for Opie's child.  Purchased by E-Rock.  It's a John Cena headband and wristband set.  Yeah, the little kid thing.  It's not a kid thing.  It's a full-size adult thing.  It was in the kids section.  This is the shit that John Cena wears. 
[03:04:30]  A kid...  Did you think a kid's head was that big?  It was in the section of the store with all the kid clothes.  So I thought that's what it was.  Apparently, E-Rock decided to get Opie some John Cena C-Nation merchandise for his kid.  How much is it?  And Opie left it here with the specific instructions that this is to be given away.  Can you get it?  After so.  How much was it, Eric?  It wasn't...  I think it was like 10, 15 bucks. 
[03:05:00]  It was probably closer to 15, wasn't it?  Somewhere in there.  I mean, it's a set of wristbands and it's WWE and it's WrestleMania.  It's not coming cheap.  Like, it's more expensive at WrestleMania than it is on the website.  How's it...  You're upset about that, Eric?  Oh, that's just another dick move.  Can Eric autograph it for the giveaway?  Because that's not even what he was keeping it for.  He wanted to hold on to it tomorrow for someone else and his family.  He said, make sure I get this tomorrow.  So, there you go.  And that's what he did. 
[03:05:30]  Why did you buy his son some C-Nation stuff?  Well, I didn't know what other kid stuff you would get.  But why are you buying his son goodies at WrestleMania?  Because he doesn't get anything.  His kid?  No.  From the wrestling thing.  I got it for him.  I was like, here, look.  Bring this home.  Because you brought something home from the event.  He wasn't going to go to the store or anything.  So, I gave it to him.  But his kid's like two.  His kid doesn't know he's at WrestleMania.  Eric, you've got to take that heart of gold of yours out of your body.  I don't know.  You keep setting yourself up for these things again. 
[03:06:00]  Did you not realize something horrible would happen?  Yeah, I don't think so.  You didn't.  No.  You decided to be nice again.  Yeah.  Boy, that don't work.  No.  Because what happened on Friday?  I don't understand.  Friday, the story of the day was, E-Rock wormed his way to go and pretended to help Sam.  And that story was the story that was put on the air by who?  By them.  The guy that you just bought C-Nation gear for. 
[03:06:30]  Hustle, loyalty, respect.  It says, hustle, loyalty, and respect, Eric.  Now, I have never seen you hustle.  You're a loyal guy, but I'm going to tell you this.  Not that Opie obviously has no respect for you because he's taken the gift.  Although the other wristband says, you can't see me.  So maybe that was the problem, that you went to give Opie a gift for his kid and he simply  couldn't see you.  I find that hard to believe based, well, don't worry about what that's based on, but  I do find it difficult to believe that he couldn't see you. 
[03:07:00]  How do you feel?  All right.  All right?  Yeah.  You're a little perturbed, aren't you?  He was pissed.  He was pissed, wasn't he?  Yeah.  He still is.  It's that moment where you just realize, you're like, fuck, I look like an asshole right  now.  You feel like an asshole?  No, not that.  I think you just feel screwed.  Do you feel like an asshole, Eric?  Once again, something is being given away.  So, yeah, I don't learn.  Like a dick, right?  Yeah.  Like the Islander picture.  That's true.  I mean, yeah, this is the guy that you gave the Islander poster to. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  You're always trying to get somebody something.  It's one thing if he's like, if it's like a special thing and he's like, oh, I want  this.  But it's another, it's strange to go up and be like, hey, Opie, I found some John Cena  shit that I just purchased.  You can give it to your kid.  And he's like, what?  What do you think of all this, Sal?  I think it's hysterical.  Why?  Well, the thing is, Eric is genuinely a really, really nice guy.  Well, I know. 
[03:08:00]  It says hustle, loyalty, respect, tenure, strong.  Eric, you know, Eric is very generous and stuff like that.  But he's, I don't know, man.  He's oblivious sometimes.  He's like that.  He's like a, he's a beaten wife.  I think he likes it.  Yeah.  I was thinking, I think Eric kind of likes it in the end.  He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a dog whose owner just keeps kicking him in the legs and putting  cigarettes out on him and pouring buckets of piss on too.  And, but the dog keeps coming back because he's like, maybe today he won't throw the  bucket of piss on me.  And then he goes, come here, boy, come here, come here. 
[03:08:30]  And Eric goes, oh, he sounds like he's in a good mood today.  So Eric comes running over and guess what happens?  Zip.  He gets a, no, it's a bucket, Sal.  Oh, it's a bucket.  It's a full bucket.  And what he does is he spends every day pissing in a bucket and he lets it collect.  And he goes, come here, boy, come here, come here.  And Eric goes, oh yeah, cool.  I'll bring my John Cena stuff that I just bought for your kid and splash bucket of piss.  I don't, I think maybe it's something that Eric's trying to relive in himself, you know, 
[03:09:00]  like buying, buying Cena shit.  I think Eric had a wonderful childhood, didn't you, Eric?  You got all kinds of goodies when you were a kid, right?  I, I grew up in a good household.  Yeah.  You, you, you grew up with a well-to-do family.  Yeah.  You, you, you want it for nothing.  I liked my parents.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I don't think it's anything like that.  I think, uh, no, I was buying for another kid and I picked those up along with it.  And I was like, oh, what'd you buy for the other kid?  Oh, for my nephew.  I bought him some Cena stuff.  Hmm.  Kids love Cena.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:09:30]  I think Eric would really like to have a relationship with Opie that's deeper than what he has.  And so he does nice things for him.  For instance, and I didn't have a problem with him doing this, but I mentioned on the show today,  I had an extra parking pass for WrestleMania because I was not going to drive there.  Uh, I was able to take a bus that had a police escort.  So I didn't have to worry about that.  And so I asked you.  And so, right.  So I picked up my parking pass and I told Eric, I have an extra parking pass.  I already picked it up and I have an extra one because I had known that Opie and Jim were 
[03:10:00]  talking about that they didn't have parking.  Um, and Eric said, let me have the parking pass and I'll give it to Opie.  And I said, great.  You know, it makes my life easier.  If you want to be the one to go and find Opie and give it to him, then you go do that.  You know, perfect.  Sounds great.  And so, and he did.  And he took the pass and then he went out of his way because he already lives in Jersey.  And that's where the show was.  Wait, he came into the city?  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Ugh.  He came, he came into the city.  Well, I picked somebody else up too.  Yeah, okay.  He came in.  Shut the fuck up, Sal.  You weren't even there.  I mean, you do that sort of stuff all the time where you try to like side swipe someone  to you get the credit.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying.  I'm not side swiping him, asshole.  If we had tickets and parking passes and we didn't give it to them and they come in  on Monday bitching and complaining for traffic or whatever and they find out that we have  these passes.  Eric, I was here on Friday.  I know the whole story.  I got, I got.  Well, you were.  Were you?  You weren't here all day Friday.  What do you mean?  You're a little late.  A little tardiness.  Just about 15 minutes late. 
[03:11:00]  I heard more like 45 minutes late.  No.  It was, I got here at 45, 545.  Yeah, that's, uh, I mean, that's, I guess that's kind of, most of us get here at five.  So we'll go, we'll go 45 minutes late.  Okay.  Most of us get here at five.  Um, but no, I don't think Eric wasn't trying to side swipe because he wasn't being secretive  about it.  He was like, Eric probably wouldn't say it only if he was asked like, Hey, where'd you  get this pass from?  You know, then he would say it.  Well, I mean, and again, I don't care.  I don't need whatever. 
[03:11:30]  He does that sort of shit.  It's annoying.  What?  It's just like you would do that sort of thing.  Like you'd be very secretive.  You know, there was no fucking secret with it, Sal.  It was, if we didn't let him know we had a pass and then Monday came around, they were  bitching about it.  We would get shit on for it.  Has he ever?  So I just asked him, I'm like, you have an extra pass.  We should give it to Hope.  That was it.  Has he ever done something like that to you where it's like maybe something you did and  then he put his name on it type of thing?  Because that's what you're kind of.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, Eric used to give me a lot of his work and then I got to a point where I  just told him I'm not. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Because I was told, give Sal something to do.  And that's what I did.  And because stuff was delegated to you, you go, I ain't fucking doing your work.  No.  What are you talking about?  I did it for months and then I just realized I have other priorities I got to work on.  So that's it.  So I went on to other things.  Eric, how come you were told to give Sal something to do?  When we hired him, I was told, what can we give Sal?  What do we have to give him?  But like, what is that?  I don't understand.  Like for me, it's like nobody tells me, nobody would ever say, hey, you need to find something  for Sam to do because I'd be like, I'm fucking busy right now. 
[03:12:30]  Why are you taking time out of your day to find something for me to do?  I'm doing shit.  Like how come Sal needed something to be found for him to do?  Was he not, he wasn't doing anything?  This was when they were determining what Sal was actually going to do here when we hired him.  Has that determination been found?  I think everyone's still confused on that.  Okay.  Everybody's still a little mixed up on it.  Trey, do you, have you been hearing this?  Yeah.  Well, I was here Friday and Sal was really venting about Eric. 
[03:13:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  See, this is the type of bullshit and you remember when I brought this up.  And this is what I told him in the office too, by the way.  This is why I brought this up before.  Eric's not around.  We're not on the air.  We're doing whatever.  If he doesn't have to be responsible for his words, he's all talk.  Oh, he was, and he was living.  Okay, you want an example?  I'll give you an example.  No, well, explain why you were upset on Friday.  Because, yeah, he was, Eric was relaying all these messages that I needed to give to the interns on Friday.  When it's like, Eric, you have their number, you have all their contact, just do it yourself. 
[03:13:30]  Why does there have to be a middleman to only complicate the situation further?  Because I was told when I'm not going to be here, it had to be relayed, everything that needed to be taken care of to everybody else.  So that's what I did.  And I do that every time if I'm not going to be here.  But why would you make it?  Just because you don't want to fucking do anything because somebody tells you something.  That's not the case.  You're still boss of the interns regardless if it's a Monday or a Saturday.  But I'm not here.  But you have their numbers.  So you're here.  So why would you relay the message through me?  That's only going to further, that's only going to take whatever you want done earlier. 
[03:14:00]  Eric, do you think Sal has a problem with delegation?  Sal has a problem, it seems to be, with anybody telling him that, hey, you have something to do.  And he goes, no, I don't want to do anything.  No, I've never said, no, I don't want to do anything.  I just have an issue when you're trying to relay a message through me when you're the boss of the interns.  Here's what I think of that.  And, Troy, you're pretty good at giving a truthful opinion.  I think that Eric would give Sal the information because then somebody here would be responsible for the interns doing it. 
[03:14:30]  That if somebody in Jersey, like if I'm an intern, right, and somebody in Jersey tells me, don't forget to clean up the studio, and I go, okay, and then I just walk home, nobody knew that I had to clean up the studio.  Right.  Because the dude's in Jersey.  Now, if somebody in Jersey told somebody that was here to tell me as an intern to do it, somebody's going to make sure it gets done.  Well, I mean, an employee has to be accountable for the work.  Right.  You can't just give it to an intern and say, well, I texted the intern.  So the employee's got to be accountable for it. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, Eric, it was all well known that Eric was coming back later that day.  And it was, Eric was doing the countdown, right?  Yes.  So, you know, my question, if I was Sal, I'd be like, well, you said you're going to do it, so why don't you just do this?  I'm working on this other thing.  Like, that's usually your job.  You're coming back to do it.  Was that what it was in relation to, Eric?  I'm a little confused.  No, because I did the countdown, and I did your show.  Right.  I built everything except the Indy countdown.  Eric did, I mean, to Eric's credit, he went out there, and he did good work with me. 
[03:15:30]  Now, like I said, everybody was saying, you know, Eric, you know, it was a goof that Eric was there as my helper.  Right.  But, to Eric's credit, he did good work for me.  I said it from the beginning, I can't look at Gary or Rob or Steve Blatter and say, I need to take Eric away from the show to help me at WrestleMania.  Right.  However, if you will allow Eric to be there, he would be a big help, and he was a giant help there.  You know what I mean? 
[03:16:00]  Beyond that, he did all morning there with me, and then he came back, and he was here all afternoon working on stuff.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He did the countdown, and he did my Sunday show.  Yeah.  So, it's not like he tried to bail out of his work here.  Right.  And that's why I'm a little confused, because I don't think he was trying to pawn anything off.  He was here all...  When you're told when anybody is not going to be here, you have to make sure that the things that you're responsible for are being covered.  Okay? 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  And the way things work around here is they need to document everything or know that somebody was talked to.  So, when things had to be laid out for what had to be taken care of during the show and after the show before I came back, that's what was done.  And it was sent to Sal.  It was sent to Travis.  And it was sent to Rob.  What specifically...  I don't know what he's complaining about, because there was nothing that was overwhelming for him that I asked to get done.  No, Eric.  What specifically were you complaining about?  It wasn't work that Eric was trying to give me.  What was the work?  It was to do the PDTs for the weekend. 
[03:17:00]  He's like, hey, is the intern still there?  I said, I don't know, Eric.  I'm doing my own things right now.  I'm occupied with that.  You have his number.  Why don't you just contact him?  He wasn't responding.  That's why I wrote to you, because you're here, and he's supposed to be here.  Okay, regardless.  No, that's not...  I mean, that's a fairly accurate response.  But if Eric didn't tell me that, Eric's like, well...  Did you ask him?  No, but Eric just texted me this whole thing.  Tell him this.  Well, I don't think it's Eric's job to say, hey, Sal, just to set everything up.  I've already spoken to the intern, but he's not picking up his phone.  So if you wouldn't mind, if Eric says, hey, find out if the intern's still here and tell 
[03:17:30]  him to do this, and you didn't...  It's just he always does this.  Yeah, but you don't say...  You don't text him back and say, why don't you tell him yourself?  I did.  You texted him back and said...  I'm pretty sure.  Didn't I say, I don't know where he is, or I don't even know what I texted you back,  but...  Okay, well, then don't say, I did, and then give me something completely different and say...  Because the fact is that you just...  It sounds like you were upset, and you just started talking about it with Troy and Roland, 
[03:18:00]  whoever was in the room.  Well, it's just like, just let me know, then, that I'm responsible for the interns now.  I was never told that, oh, Sal, you're in charge of the interns if Eric's not here.  You know what I mean?  So all of a sudden, now it's another thing I think about throughout the day that, oh,  Eric's texting me to work to tell the interns to do.  Well, it's not a matter of your...  You don't have to be overarching in charge of the interns, but if Eric goes, hey, help  me out with this, it's not crazy to be like, oh, okay, it's a weird day, Eric is in Jersey, 
[03:18:30]  because whether you think he should be there or not, Gary and Opie said he should be there,  so he's there.  I didn't say anything about him going there or not.  So it's not crazy for you to be like, oh, okay, I'll help him out and do this.  Is it?  No, but I do understand both sides of the story here.  I do understand, because first of all, you know, it's frustrating for Eric, because Sal  a lot of times doesn't want to work.  He doesn't want to put in the work that it takes for that position.  I've always helped out Eric, though.  For that position.  And then at the same time...  What position? 
[03:19:00]  For the associate producer position that Sal has.  Right.  Meaning the guy who sits there and is like, yo, I need this cut up, I need this, like grunt  work.  Grunt work, and he's low man on the totem pole, which means he has to pick up a lot of the  fucking bullshit that we've all had to go through, every one of us.  So it's now his turn to do it, and he doesn't want to do it.  So I understand Eric being frustrated on that end.  But I also understand Sal with his frustration with Eric, because I've worked closely with Eric  in Sal's position.  And Eric does do stuff that's just kind of like, well, pawn off work just as much as 
[03:19:30]  he possibly can.  Do you feel that's what you're doing on Friday, Eric?  No.  You weren't?  Not at all what I was doing on Friday.  And I'm not saying it was Friday, but I just do understand where Sal's coming from.  I have the text here.  Okay, what does the text say?  So throughout the show, I was coordinating with Sal on various things.  You know, stuff that had to be given to Sal, your voice tracks, stuff like that.  And then after that, I said, did Alan leave?  Because he wasn't picking up the phone.  I didn't tell Sal that part.  I just wrote to him.  Did Alan leave?  Okay.  Okay. 
[03:20:00]  Alan wasn't picking up his phone.  And he said, he's doing something for Troy.  So that means he's here.  Okay.  So I said, here's the PDTs for the countdown, which means the pad data stuff you see on the  screen for those listening.  Give this to Alan to do the PDTs, which is also what I said in the email the other day  that I would provide this for the intern.  That's fine.  And he just writes back, call him.  I don't know where he is.  So Sal's issue was that he didn't want to tell the intern to do the work. 
[03:20:30]  I didn't know that Eric wasn't able to get in touch with it.  In my mind, I thought the scenario was Eric is just telling me to do something just to  tell the intern.  It has to happen all the time, where even the littlest thing that has to be covered  by anybody here.  It's not even real work.  Yeah.  It's just, all you had to do was go tell the intern to do it.  It's, I honestly, I didn't know that Eric couldn't get in touch with the intern.  What difference does it make?  This goes back to the original thing that started this, where he was complaining about  the emails I sent out.  The email was to cover the basis. 
[03:21:00]  So not only that the stuff that I wasn't here for could be taken care of, but everything  for the show, the channel, whatever, until I got back was being taken care of.  So how is that being a pain in the ass, giving you work and being irresponsible?  The email you sent, I understood.  I understood all that.  You just were complaining that.  That started all of this.  Do you have so much on your plate that, like you said, you're busy concentrating on everything?  Is there so much on your plate?  No.  That you couldn't walk up the hallway?  I interpreted it as Eric, Eric was pulling a power move to make me get, he's got more 
[03:21:30]  power than you.  But Eric does this sort of stuff though.  He does this sort of like, like where he wants you to, to just show that he has power around  just to, just to make you do shit, just to inconvenience you.  What am I doing to make, to inconvenient you?  It's just, it's just, I get that interpretation.  I just get that feeling from you sometimes.  I get the, I get that feeling where you'll, you'll, you'll assign me something that you could  just easily do yourself, have it handled quicker, but you want to give it to me just  because you can give it to me.  Yeah, but you know what?  When, uh, Raw Dog ran the Louis C.K. segment from, uh, the other day, Thursday, they can 
[03:22:00]  give him as a guest.  Okay.  From, from Thursday's show, Louis was on Thursday, right?  So Rob comes up to me and he goes, Hey, Raw Dog's going to run this segment.  And he goes, can you voice it?  I go, of course.  Yeah.  I'll host for Raw Dog because I've hosted for Raw Dog before.  And he goes, okay, yeah, we can just cut out this part and start from there.  And I said, no, I'm not going to edit it.  Like, I can edit it.  It wouldn't take me long.  I know how to edit, but I'm not going to because I spent a lot of time editing and now I'm not 
[03:22:30]  going to do that.  And so it was pawned off probably on you or somebody else.  Yeah, I did it.  But that makes sense though.  But then how come Eric can't be like, just go find the intern?  No, no, no.  It's, it's, it's a different scenario there.  Something like that, that needs to get done quickly, expeditiously.  It needs to happen right away.  But then Eric will give me something that it's just part of his routine that he usually  does throughout his week or whatever like that.  It's like, just do it yourself.  I'd like to continue on the other work that I'm working on. 
[03:23:00]  What specifically though?  Because I, all I hear specifically is this thing where you didn't want to go look for the  intern.  No, it wasn't that I interpreted it differently because you're watching drumming videos.  I apologize that.  I apologize for that.  I thought Eric was just trying to be an asshole to me.  That's all.  Don't apologize for it because you're going to, you'll do the same thing again.  You don't apologize for it.  What do you mean I'll do the same thing again?  You don't think Eric was being an asshole?  Do I think, I, if I didn't, I didn't know he didn't, he wasn't able to get in touch with  the intern.  Therefore, at that moment in time, yes, I did think Eric was trying to break my life.  But then why wouldn't you have asked him?  What's up?  Why wouldn't you have asked him?  I told him.  I said, call the intern. 
[03:23:30]  And he didn't write anything back.  So I'm assuming he just wasn't calling the intern.  Yeah, but don't you think that's a pain in the ass text to get from somebody who is your  subordinate?  We were pulling down, remember, I was the last one there with the internet feed because they  were wrapping everything up because I had to send everything out.  You were, we, we were doing, we were putting together four shows from the IZOD Center.  We had stuff on our plate, I'm saying.  And I'm writing him, I'm just, I'm not even thinking of the fact that I did say, oh, I  called Alan, he's not picking up.  But when I just said, did Alan leave? 
[03:24:00]  No.  He's doing something for Troy.  Okay, so he's there.  Here's the PDTs.  Can you, you know, make sure he's doing this?  Give him a call.  I don't know where he is.  Yeah.  And what he was doing for me could have easily been on hold.  And I wasn't saying that whatever he's doing for Troy isn't important or any of that  stuff.  The thing that's, the thing that for me, if Sal's in the office and this is the whole  thing, it doesn't matter what anybody was doing.  Because I heard the text that you just read, Eric.  Yeah.  I don't understand why you would respond to Eric and say, call Alan, instead of just 
[03:24:30]  calling Alan yourself.  Yeah, I just thought Eric was trying to be an asshole to me.  That's the only reason why.  You always think that.  And that's not the case.  But that sounds like you're being an asshole.  Because you're saying, call Alan, instead of being like, yeah, I will help you out because  we work together.  No, I understand.  It just didn't make sense to me because Eric was coming back here to work.  So I didn't realize that he was trying to give the intern the work earlier then so  that he wouldn't have to do it when he got there.  You know what I mean?  But Eric said that in the email also the day before I left, that the intern was going to  do the PDT.  I don't understand when I finished everything. 
[03:25:00]  I don't understand any of it because I don't understand why it would be any more complicated  than, oh, let me just go call Alan.  In retrospect, I have a greater understanding of the situation.  Now, at the time.  This is crazy to me.  I know.  There's nothing here.  There is something here because we have to analyze the fact that you can't just like  read a text and do what the text says.  Well, there's been, Sal is frustrated because I think he thinks a lot of work has been pawned  off on him from Eric.  So like a lot of Eric's work that he could handle has just been given to Sal to do. 
[03:25:30]  So Sal, I think, is just frustrated and was like, oh, this is another example of this.  It mainly comes from Eric.  When you guys give me work that you need to hand with, it's usually a little more, how do  you describe it, a little more intricate, I guess, a little more technically involved.  Makes sense to you.  Yeah, it makes sense.  It makes sense.  It makes sense if he wants to do versus work he doesn't want to do is what it is.  Yeah.  Because the work that was given to Sal has always been approved by somebody down the  hall.  So you think that when Troy and me give you work, it's that Troy and me have our specialties. 
[03:26:00]  This doesn't fall into that, so we give it to you?  Right.  Or is it that you like the work that Troy and me give you and you don't like the stuff?  No, I mean, if anything, the work you guys give me is much more involved.  It's not necessarily more pleasing.  It's not more creative?  Yeah, it's definitely more creative.  So doesn't that make it more interesting?  To an extent.  Yeah.  But a lot of the work that Eric has given me is just simple, like...  Loading.  Yeah, it's just like...  Futility work.  Mindless work, yeah.  So that's the problem, then.  You don't like doing the mindless work. 
[03:26:30]  It's not that I like doing it.  It's just like, if he needs it done, why can't he just do it himself when I could be doing  other things?  You know what I mean?  You also gotta understand that Eric is two levels above you.  Right.  Do you know what I mean?  I understand the power rankings and all that sort of stuff.  He's a senior producer, so I mean, technically, he can say, do all my fucking work and sit  there and just delegate the work.  Now, Eric wouldn't do that, nor would it be fair for him to do that.  But technically, he could.  I mean, that sounds job.  Right.  And the other problem, I think, is there's no boss that the employees fear. 
[03:27:00]  Do you know what I mean?  That's running the show where they're like, they tell Sal, like, you need to do this.  Because, like, really, like, Eric can't fire Sal.  No.  He can't, you know, put him on suspension.  So it's like, there's nobody that has that authority that works directly with the show.  Let me talk to some of these folks.  People have opinions.  Kevin in Texas, you're on the after show.  Two things.  First off, Sam, you did a great job yesterday.  It was badass.  Thank you very much, man.  Yeah, and by the way, the WrestleMania show, and I got a lot of comments from people who 
[03:27:30]  enjoyed it, even though they weren't wrestling fans.  So if you have any interest in me doing interviews with wrestlers, it's going to go up on demand.  We can get it up later today, right, Eric?  Yeah.  That's really cool.  Yeah, we'll get it up.  I'm sure Eric will just ask Sal to do it.  Yeah, I was going to say, I'll go do it.  We'll get it up on demand later today.  It's got, like, interviews, new interviews with, like, CM Punk and Paul Heyman and Dolph Ziggler.  Sorry, I asked Dolph Ziggler about Amy Schumer, so it was exciting.  But go on, Kevin.  That was cool.  Second thing, Sal is a whiny bitch. 
[03:28:00]  He's not a team player.  You know, why question anything?  Just get the goddamn job done and be happy that you're there.  Eric's got seniority.  You got seniority.  Just get the things done and move ahead.  Quit being it.  I hear this day in, day out on this show.  Sal's always the whiny bitch.  What about that, Sal?  What about just get the job done?  Yeah, I'll do that.  And get it done properly.  Yeah.  I mean, I always, when Eric ever gives me something, I always do it properly.  I don't, like, purposely fuck it up or anything like that.  I always do it quickly and efficiently. 
[03:28:30]  I think that's a very important thing to do.  Yeah, but then you have something to say about it.  Of course.  Well, I mean, that's part of it, though.  Like, I'll just stop bitching about it then.  Well, no, it's not a matter of just don't be vocal about it.  It's a matter of, if you have reason to complain.  If you think you have reason to complain about tasks being given to you, then by all means, complain.  I think the issue is whether or not you actually have something to complain about.  Like, it doesn't sound, in this instance, specifically, I don't see what you had to complain about. 
[03:29:00]  This one sounds like Eric was in the right and was just like, just call this kid for me.  I'm doing stuff over here.  And you were like, oh, fuck Eric.  Right?  Yeah.  Is that far from the truth?  No, that's exactly what happened.  So, yeah.  Let me talk to Gus in Houston.  What's up, Gus?  Hey.  I know the whole style's a whiny bitch.  I think that's just a foregone conclusion, so I'm not even going to make that point.  Good.  I think that he confuses on-air Eric with Eric is my superior off-air. 
[03:29:30]  So, off-air, it's not a fucking bit.  Dude, they ask you to do something.  Shut the fuck up and do it.  You don't have to know why.  It's called being a grunt.  You have to pay your dues.  I'm tired of this.  Oh, my God.  I'm so tired of this entitled bullshit, dude.  Yeah.  Just do it.  Just do it.  You have to pay your dues.  You want to get somewhere in this business.  You want to...  I can see why OB fucking hates you, because he has to pay his dues.  I'm not sure...  He has to pay his dues.  Yeah.  Thanks, Gus.  Yes, sir.  All right, buddy.  Do you want to get somewhere in this business, or you don't care?  Of course. 
[03:30:00]  No, no, no.  Tell me the truth.  No, absolutely.  I would love to advance further.  No, no, no.  I know you would love to advance further.  Who wouldn't love to advance further?  But do you want to go further in this business?  Absolutely.  Or is this paying the bills while we work on music?  No.  I love working here.  I love working for this show.  Of course, I want to further myself.  Yeah.  Do you really love working for this show?  I do.  I genuinely do.  I hear my friends who have other jobs.  I have by far the most exciting job.  Yeah, because I don't believe you.  Because if I were in your position, I would not love working for this show. 
[03:30:30]  Many times, I don't love working for this show.  And I kind of have a pretty sweet deal here.  Of anybody here.  I think that's fair of everybody here.  What?  What you just said.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But, like, if I were in Sal's position, I would think most days I wouldn't like working for the show.  I mean, Eric, I would assume your worst days on the show are when you're getting shit upon, correct?  Yeah.  Those are the days that you like working on the show least, correct?  Well, who would enjoy that?  Correct.  Which is why, I mean, it happens to you a lot. 
[03:31:00]  Which is why it would make me think I wouldn't like that.  And he's not going to say that he, you know, he hates the show.  Because then everybody's going to be like, fucking good, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, yeah.  So he has to say, like, oh, no, I do like working here.  Well, he also said, too, that he hears from a lot of people that like the show that you have a really cool job.  So he might like the appeal of the job to other people.  He likes to go out and be like, yo, look where I work.  No, I don't think he flaunts it, but I think he likes hearing when people say, oh, that they know he works on the show. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, shit, you got a picture with Mike Tyson.  That's crazy.  So that's why he's liking the job, not because, you know, radio was his thing.  And I'm sure he likes the interest in him on, you know, social media sites and stuff like that.  Because it's like all of a sudden people care about you.  And it doesn't hurt.  You know, he's in the music industry.  It doesn't hurt, you know, he meets an artist and he's like, yeah, I work at SiriusXM.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think he wants advanced in radio.  I don't think he wants advanced in radio production or in audio production.  That's why he likes the stuff that we give him because it's doing what he does. 
[03:32:00]  Is that true or false?  I mean, I love doing, I love, okay, I can say this for a fact.  I love working with Troy and Sam because I was pointing at you guys way more than I like working with Eric.  It's much more creative and it has a. . .  But was Troy right in the sense that you want to improve your audio production skills, not necessarily move further advance in the radio industry?  I would like to have more position of like what Troy has where it's more. . .  Production.  Like, yeah, all day radio production as opposed to, you know, doing the phones for four hours and then doing the other things. 
[03:32:30]  You've got to understand, man.  I had to do all that shit too, dude.  That would be like an intern coming in and being like, so I would really like to get a job like Sam has where he gets to go and interview wrestlers.  But I just told you, you just asked what I wanted to do.  That's what I wanted to do.  I'm not saying give me that job.  Sal's had a way better advantage than I was when I started because everybody that remembers that was listening back at the time, I was trying to get Pro Tools.  I couldn't get it.  For two, two and a half, three years, they would not give me Pro Tools. 
[03:33:00]  Sal, day one, starting, had Pro Tools at his desk.  So Pro Tools is, you know, the editing stuff that we make the production with.  And Troy's battle cries, his original complaints, because he's always had, progressively, you've always had some kind of complaint.  Yes.  But the original complaint that was brought to the show was they won't give me the tools needed to complete this job.  Right.  Correct?  That was the battle cry, wasn't it?  And I was doing work at home.  Right.  Right.  I mean, do you think Sal would take production home to do it at home?  Sal once told me, I'm not going to do shit at home. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  I looked at him like, what?  I mean, I have a different mentality now.  You do?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  You would do shit at home?  Yeah, I mean, I do one sheets at home.  I work on stuff like that at my place, but yeah.  Grizz in Boston.  Fuck it and suck it, dude.  Yeah, buddy.  What's going on?  I just wanted to let Troy know, Joe DeRosa headlines at the WrestleCon at the $5 wrestling show at midnight, Saturday night.  He did?  Yes, he did.  And boy, did he suck a big bag of dick. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, come on, Grizz.  Hey, hey, it wasn't just me.  I thought he was all right, but he got a bad reaction.  Those nerds did not like DeRosa.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Thank you for calling in, Grizz.  But that's...  No problem, dude.  That's...  I mean, we were talking about something else entirely.  That's totally...  I have all the calls.  You picked that one.  No, I didn't know.  This is blind.  We don't have a phone screener, unfortunately.  Denise in New York.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  I just wanted to say, I've listened to your show from the start every day. 
[03:34:30]  I love it.  Thank you.  But it's getting to the point that it's every day self-complaining.  It's not that he doesn't want to do mindless work.  Right.  He doesn't want to do any work.  I don't know why you keep him around.  I really don't.  It's tough to fire somebody in this...  It's really hard.  It is.  It's even hard just to move him to a different position.  You know what it is?  It's because it's lawsuits.  People are afraid of wrongful termination lawsuits.  And, you know, Sal strikes me as the type that would possibly complain to parents and sue a company.  Wouldn't you think?  Yeah, because he'd be like, well, I was gay. 
[03:35:00]  And now they fired me because I was gay.  Yeah, that's fucked up, man.  Anyway, I'm just hanging out with my boyfriend right now.  You think, would you ever do that?  Would you sue...  If they fired you today, based on the after show, they were like, Jesus Christ.  Is that a clip of Troy calling me gay?  Is that what you're saying?  No, no, no.  If they were like, Jesus Christ, Sal really does have a piss poor attitude.  He wouldn't call the intern because he didn't want to make a phone call because Eric was working in New Jersey.  Sal, you're fired.  Would you then go and try to twist it and be like, they fired me because I'm gay? 
[03:35:30]  No.  I would never imply such a thing because I'm not gay.  What?  Yeah, I know.  It's a shocker.  It's a shocker.  What?  I mean, if we're just going to do bits, we'll just do bits then.  We're not going to be honest.  Tony in Jersey.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  I don't think that Sal would survive at any other job anywhere, so he better love his job there.  How many employees get to not do their work and then come up with excuses why they didn't want to do it and discuss it and still keep their job? 
[03:36:00]  Pretty much, I think, I think it's pretty much just, in terms of that description, I think pretty much just Sal and E-Rock.  Just Sal and Stu, pretty much.  It's just like you can't pick and choose your work.  Right.  Eric is your boss.  Right.  When your boss tells you to do something, you do it.  You shouldn't have an excuse.  I'm just going to do my work now.  That's how I get ahead.  That's how people like me.  And then that's how I succeed.  Not, well, I'm going to question this. 
[03:36:30]  I don't want to do that.  That's just crazy.  That's not any other job.  That's nowhere.  I think the problem is Eric's not really his boss.  He's his superior.  He's above him in rank.  He's his superior.  But like I said, he can't, you know, if Sal's fucking up, he can't suspend him.  Can Eric tell you what to do?  Yes.  He can.  Yeah.  Do you have to listen to him?  I'm not, this isn't a trick question.  No, I mean, Eric can absolutely tell me what to do.  I don't pay attention to how things work. 
[03:37:00]  So I don't, I mean, I know that Eric's title is above Sal's title, but I don't know if Eric  can actually tell Sal what to do.  When the show is on, anything that anyone asks me, I do.  Right, right, right.  But then the show is off for many hours.  Right.  Yeah.  No, I mean, can he tell you what to do in your mind?  If Eric tells you what to do, is it like your boss telling you what to do?  I mean, yeah, I mean, I would definitely help him out.  So if your boss, the person who hires or fires you, said, I need you to tell this to the 
[03:37:30]  intern, you would text your boss back and say, call yourself.  But like Troy's saying, Eric isn't my boss.  So he's not, that's what I'm saying.  So he can't tell you what to do.  He can, though, because of the seniority and tenure ranking.  Yeah, but you don't have to listen.  I don't have to listen, but I do it.  There really isn't like a boss boss.  Eric, are you, does Sal have to listen to you?  Yeah, he should.  He should.  And that's the difference, I think.  He should. 
[03:38:00]  He doesn't have to.  Because most of the time when there's a reason behind things that have to be done or whatever,  and you don't need to be like, well, why the fuck are you telling me to do this?  Or I'm not going to do this because you told me to do it.  It's like, why do I have to fight with him all the time over dumb shit?  Usually I do.  If you ask me to do something, I usually do it.  When the show is on, I don't even ask questions.  It's just get it done, ASAP, whatever it needs to be done.  Is that true, Eric?  For the most part.  Okay.  But when we're more off air, let's say, it just, sometimes it's confusing to me to, for Eric to be like, hey, can you do this for me? 
[03:38:30]  When it's just something that Eric traditionally does, or he could just do quicker himself.  But to be fair, and we've all been here, so I'm not just casting blame on you.  Yeah.  But you do get off on saying no to Eric.  It's amazing.  Okay.  It's so much fun.  Eric, do you find it fun?  No.  And then he complains when I go, okay, you don't want to listen to this.  And I go a step higher.  And then he complains, why did you tell them? 
[03:39:00]  Because you didn't do what was told.  You rat him out a lot?  All the time.  When it's important, yeah.  He rats you out a lot?  Oh, yeah, I've heard from many people that it doesn't matter.  I see him on the emails.  Who do you rat him out to?  Boss Cross.  Rob Cross?  Yeah.  Is that who it is?  That's who you were talking about?  Oh, I didn't even know that.  Who are you talking about?  Gary?  Well, Travis has told me that Eric's gone to Travis before and said that, like.  This is the fucking craziest thing in the world.  I go, who's Eric ratted you out to?  And Sal goes, it doesn't even matter. 
[03:39:30]  And the big reveal is Travis.  He didn't want to name Travis.  I went to Steve Blatter and was telling him.  He didn't want to name drop Travis.  Travis, I hope you're not mad at Sal back there in the office.  No, because when there's an issue and I tell some of the bosses, they said, did you talk  to Travis yet?  And it's either yes or no.  So I have to.  So the chain of command is, I have to go to Travis.  And then after Travis goes up.  I know.  I think.  It's so fucking weird, isn't it, Troy?  It's just bizarre.  It's just like sending this person to here, to there, to there.  Nobody wants to be the boss.  Yeah, nobody is the boss.  You know what happens? 
[03:40:00]  After this, I'll tell you all what happens.  I'll let everybody in.  Okay?  Because everybody wonders.  This is one of the main questions I get when I meet people and we're talking and everything.  It's like, what do you really do for Opie and Anthony?  And, you know, I try to explain that they're pretty, Opie, Anthony, and Jim are a fairly  self-sufficient unit, meaning you put stuff in front of them, you think that they might  like, and then you just see what they do.  And you're kind of just have to be there as they go to pick up on whatever it is that  they're doing and try to make their time easier. 
[03:40:30]  Right?  Right.  Now, when they're gone, basically what happens is management opens up a cell, like a jail  cell, and they shove everybody who works on the show in the jail cell, and they give  us some pads of papers and computers, and they go, okay, come up with some shit, and  then they leave.  Yeah.  And then everybody just fights.  Yeah.  And everybody throws their shit at each other, and Roland pours club soda on himself.  That's basically...  That's...  And water.  And some water, too.  Thank you. 
[03:41:00]  That's basically what happens.  Mm-hmm.  Which is crazy town.  Yeah.  Because there is nobody that's holding it together.  And then a young guy like Sal comes in, and he's like, oh, fuck it, every man for himself.  This is great.  Lord of the Flies.  I know who Piggy is, and it's not going to be me.  Right?  Have you ever read Lord of the Flies?  Yeah.  Eric, that wasn't a joke about you being fat.  There is a character named Piggy.  I know it was a character, I know.  Do you think you're Piggy in this Lord of the Flies?  Sure, why not?  Keep the story moving.  Do you think you are?  Don't smash his glasses, Sal.  If I see you smash Eric's glasses, I'm going to be pissed. 
[03:41:30]  What's my glasses?  Didn't he get it smashed in the head with a boulder or something?  That was later.  Spoiler alert.  You read Lord of the Flies, right?  Yeah.  Patrick in Connecticut, what's up, buddy?  Hey, Sal, you seem like a decent guy.  I kind of identify with you because you had a kind of an upper-class upbringing.  Well to do.  He wanted for nothing.  Yeah, well, and there is a stigma when you're raised like that of, well, you know, technically  I don't have to do this because in the end my parachute is much larger than most people. 
[03:42:00]  Right.  You got that big golden parachute.  Right.  Unfortunately, what Sal doesn't realize is that big golden parachute is just weighing  him down to the ground.  It's just rushing him quickly to the field.  That's absolutely true.  I struggle with that too.  But I recently started a year and a half ago in real estate and I worked for this big  shot in Fairfield County.  And Sal, if you think what you're being required to do or asked to do is stupid and mundane, 
[03:42:30]  I had a fucking open house on the other side of Fairfield County.  And I'm required to then drive to his open house afterwards to pick up the signs in his  yard.  Now, let's say he's there.  He is at that house.  Yeah.  But I'm required to drive over there and pick those signs up.  And I don't fucking ask questions.  I just do it.  All the other stuff.  I'll be on my way home driving 20 minutes and then I'll get a call saying, hey, I need  you to go do this.  And I have to go turn around and go all over the place.  I've driven in about three months. 
[03:43:00]  I've driven about 13,000 miles.  So you really need to just pick up signs, 13,000 miles to pick up signs and showings  and all that crap.  I'm saying in the last three months, I've driven 13,000 miles.  How pissed would you be, Sal, if Eric was like, Sal, I need you to come over to my house.  There's some rocks on my lawn.  I need you to brush them off.  He would.  Eric would do it.  Sign guy, whoever he is, that's Eric.  That's Eric being like, well, Eric, you are the guy who's been here the longest time. 
[03:43:30]  You have garnered the authority to be able to ask people to remove signs from your lawn.  Am I right?  I guess so.  Yeah.  Now, let me put it this way.  And now I've been doing this for a little over a year and a half.  I don't have to do that shit anymore because we have a new person.  Right.  We have a new person that does that shit.  I'll tell you what, Patrick.  If you had been complaining about this the whole way and you had been difficult about it,  would you still be picking up signs?  No, not at all.  I'd be done.  I'd be back to corporate or something.  There's no way.  There's no questions, man. 
[03:44:00]  You just do it, man.  Like the other guy said, pay your dues and you'll eventually, if you stop complaining  about it and you just do it, people recognize that stuff.  And not to sound all cheated, but that's how you further yourself.  I understand what you're saying.  Thanks, Patrick.  I don't really complain from anyone else except for Eric.  Because you think he gives you a lot of grunt work that's really his work.  It's not necessarily, I don't know, I guess it's the manner in which he gives it to me  or it's just kind of like...  Is he disrespectful when he gives you work?  No.  Is he dismissive? 
[03:44:30]  No, maybe a little dismissive.  Like a bit like you're a servant?  It's not that bad.  Oh.  But, you know, in my mind I'm thinking, well, if I were able to be working with Sam and  Troy more often...  Is that because you want to suck my dick?  Yes, Sam.  That's exactly it.  Oh, that's weird.  No, in my mind I'm thinking...  The other day I'm talking about it.  Yeah, of course.  That got weird, didn't it?  Oh, yeah.  All right, go on, Sam.  He said that.  In my mind...  Yeah, sure.  That's like he said he's kidding now and it's like one of those things, like, do you  want to go out? 
[03:45:00]  And it's like, no, I know, I'm kidding.  Yeah, no.  I would never do that.  Yeah, do you want to go to the prom with me?  No, I already have a date.  I know, I'm kidding.  I do too.  I'm joking.  Totally joking.  You didn't get that?  Anyway, I'll see you later.  Go on, Sam.  Anyway, what I was saying...  No, I'm not gay.  I know, neither am I.  I was kidding, bro.  Anyway, peace out.  I don't want to hug.  No, I don't want to...  Should we hug each other?  No, I know, right?  That's gross.  Yeah, totally.  I'm with you.  Anyway, I'll talk to you later.  All righty.  What I was saying is, by working in a more creative aspect... 
[03:45:30]  Do you want to trade clothes or something?  No, I'm good with my clothes.  I know, me too.  That's so stupid.  Anyway, I'll talk to you later.  I didn't wear special underwear.  Yeah, I'll talk to you later.  Yeah.  I'm getting you to 211.  Yeah, no, go ahead.  You're not...  Please, let me tell you something, Sam.  I'm kidding, Sam.  You know what's getting me to 11?  I'm kidding, dude.  The same person who gets me to 11 every day.  That's me.  Right.  I look around this studio almost every day.  And you're in here almost every day.  And you know what I see?  A pile of no help from anyone.  Right.  Every day.  All right?  I have to fucking drag all of you.  Not everyone in this room.  Sam, I'm just kidding. 
[03:46:00]  Travis is good when he comes in.  Roland always has some dumb shit to say.  And Troy's always good.  But the rest of you, I have to drag until 11 o'clock out of you, okay?  Like your sacks of rocks attached to my ankles.  I was just kidding.  Don't tell me what you're doing for me.  Go on with what you were saying.  You sound frustrated.  What I was saying is...  Well, there's an anchor on my belt.  Who walks around with an anchor on their belt?  They're heavy enough to keep a boat from floating away.  And I'm a human being.  Anyway, as you were saying, Sal.  I think it's more beneficial for me to be working with you and Troy and a more creative element 
[03:46:30]  because that provides something that I can add as opposed to something that...  Right.  Do you think your work that Eric's giving me that just literally an intern could do?  Do you think your well-to-do background makes it so that you have this sort of aura of,  at the end of the day, I don't need this?  No, I need it.  My parents don't help me out anymore.  They would.  You don't need it.  You're not going to be homeless.  No.  I'm not going to be homeless.  Right, so that's what I'm saying. 
[03:47:00]  At the end of the day...  Like, for instance, I know that if I lost this job, I'm not going to be homeless.  My parents aren't broke.  So I'm never...  Like, I know going into life, I'm never going to be homeless.  No.  Yeah, I won't be homeless.  But this is all I want to do, so I need it.  And these fuckers at Sirius know it, too.  They got me by the fucking balls, and they all know it down there, don't they, Troy?  Oh, yeah.  Stringing you along, buddy.  Bunch of assholes every day.  Stringing you along.  Just stringing me along.  Oh, look at this, Sam.  We got a little care for you.  Oh, really?  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  Oh, just work hard. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, just keep working, though.  It's a little higher.  You can get it, though.  Just keep reaching.  Maybe we'll reevaluate in a couple months.  They know it.  They know they got me by the balls.  Yeah, we're going to reevaluate.  We usually don't do it, but six months.  All right, all right, all right.  I'll be there.  Yeah.  I'll be there.  You know, you do this.  It could be good for you, you know.  Oh, really?  In the future.  I'll do it then.  They say reassess.  Right.  See, Sal has never worked...  I've said this before.  Sal's never worked a real job.  He's never had to work hard.  You know what I mean?  He's never, you know, been, like, having to fucking work in a factory or deal with a  lot of bullshit and be the fucking... 
[03:48:00]  Be the shithead in a factory.  But I also think that Sal is not going to be homeless.  So you're going to be, like, if you...  Your parents aren't helping you out anymore, but if you needed them to, they would.  And that's fine.  Yeah.  There's nothing...  I don't fault you for that.  He very well may...  They may be helping out.  He's just not going to say it on the air.  Yeah, I mean, I think they're still probably paying his phone bill and some shit like that.  Yeah, probably his cable.  He's probably got, like, a sling box connected to his parents' house or something like that.  That is true.  All right.  So they're not technically paying for their...  But they did your case.  I mean, yeah.  You're not paying for your own.  Right.  I mean, people who watch television, a lot of them pay for it themselves. 
[03:48:30]  Right.  Like adults, I'm talking about.  Right, right, right.  And you don't have, like, this desire to be like, this is make or break for me.  Like, I have to be here doing this.  So it's like, at the end of the day, you're like, eh.  I don't really need to do that.  I don't...  Is there a little of that, you think?  I don't look at it as black and white like that.  You know what I mean?  Shades of gray.  Like, not like black or white.  Like, I don't need this.  I do need this.  A little of this.  Eh. 
[03:49:00]  I don't mean...  Eh.  He doesn't want to be in radio.  He doesn't have a passion for radio.  He doesn't want to be a broadcaster.  So his job or what he does with production can be done in music.  It can be done in a million different ways.  So...  And that's why he's like, oh, this is fun.  I like this.  I'll do this.  And then Eric's like, oh, could you hook me up with the worst of the week countdown?  Eh.  Yeah, that doesn't benefit his audio career.  Yeah, no.  I think it's also the company or the show will be getting more out of me utilizing my strengths as opposed to... 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, I thought the same thing.  But you just have to do it.  Yeah.  I mean, dude, are you 23 years old?  20, yeah.  Okay, so you don't have any strengths.  It's like, dude, like, you gotta just fucking suck it up, man.  No, I understand.  And you gotta let the people that have more strength than you in certain areas, they do what they do.  And then you have to back them up.  And then you slowly start moving your way up the ranks.  Hang on.  Let me talk to Joe in Jersey.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Great show yesterday.  Amazing job.  Thanks, dude.  All right.  So, listen, I've managed people and have for years. 
[03:50:00]  It doesn't matter what you're doing, what you think you're strong in.  At the end of the day, whether you end up in radio, whether you move on, people are going to remember your work ethic.  And it's garbage.  The only thing that should come out of your mouth if someone, like Eric says, I need this done, is yes.  And when do you need it?  That's it.  There are no other answers to this.  Period.  Hey, Joe, do you want our Sudoku C-Nation prize package? 
[03:50:30]  That'd be awesome.  All right.  I got these, dude.  And do you want to...  Actually, no, I'll take those.  I don't have ticket stumps.  He sounds like a nice kid, and, you know, and I mean, I don't know him, so, you know, I can't think personally of it, you know, but it is pretty common that most young kids coming up, and it doesn't matter what field they're working in, is that there's zero initiative to this.  And you were describing earlier that you would take on these tasks that work without asking to be told to.  And he's taking it even to another level where someone's telling him this money. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah, not only is he not, like, being like, yeah, I'm just going to start doing this, but he's actually being asked to start doing it, and he's like, that's not for me.  That one's not for me.  People in my business will look for something very specific, like, I'll just compare it to radio.  You know, they want to know what radio experience you're having, what radio experience.  They're forgetting the very basics of, how about just a responsible human being to start?  Right.  And then we'll throw in some radio stuff on top of it.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold, and I'm going to give you the C-Nation Sudoku prize package. 
[03:51:30]  I appreciate it, man.  Thanks.  Eric, are you okay with Joe getting the C-Nation gear that you bought for Opie's kid?  Sure, why not?  That's got to suck.  It's fairly humiliating, isn't it, Travis?  I mean, just to have it cast aside so quickly.  I mean, it's 1049.  He literally, Eric handed this to Opie at the end of the show.  And immediately, when Eric left the room, Opie said, does anybody want this? 
[03:52:00]  And I was like, you know, I'd look a fool wearing C-Nation wristbands around the office.  So he said, give them to a caller.  He's wearing them now.  Yeah, he's on Fox Business.  Oh, shit!  What's John Cena doing on Fox?  He's got the belt.  See, the fucking rock.  He was doing all this press.  He would never bring his belt with him.  Oh, he's not proud.  He's an asshole.  That's why I'm in the C-Nation.  Are you in the C-Nation, Sal?  I'm not really sure what that is.  You son of a bitch.  Frank in New York.  Hey, guys.  Are you in the C-Nation, Troy?  Fuck no. 
[03:52:30]  Go ahead, Frank.  Sal is the way he is because the Opie and Anthony show has a long, proud tradition of the inmates running the asylum.  Whether it was Rick, Ben, Steve, Restis, Saul, you guys all treated them like shit.  True.  That's one of you.  I mean, he wants to be one of the cool kids.  Yeah, but you know what?  You know what the thing is, though?  At the end of the day, with all those people, even with Steve, Steve got it the worst on the air, but Steve could tell us to do things, and they would actually get done. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  There'd be a lot of ball busting, but they would get done.  There was no, like, I would never, if Steve texted me and said, I need you to tell the intern something, I would never, I might send him a text that said, error 404 and just be goofy, but then I would call the intern.  I would never text Steve back and be like, call him yourself.  I can't tell you how many times Danny told Steve to go fuck himself on air. 
[03:53:30]  Well, guess what?  It didn't exactly work out that well for Danny, did it?  No, it did not.  No.  And for a show with no screener, you know everybody's name.  Huh?  I'll talk to you later, Frank.  Yeah.  You feel like you learned something today, Sal?  Yep.  You know what I feel like, Travis?  What's that?  Sal gets these lessons, like, literally several times a week now.  Yeah.  In one ear, out the other every time.  Right out.  It is, right?  You know what?  Here's the problem.  Is, you know, I agree with everybody's points here, but it's also so easy to just want to give Eric shit. 
[03:54:00]  Right.  So, like, I can see where Sal would get caught up in the whole thing.  And you can get away with not doing shit.  Yeah, because there's no boss.  Right.  So, you could be like, oh, Eric's like, hey, Sal, can you help me out in the countdown?  Hey, Eric, can you help me out?  Go fucking yourself?  Fuck you, dickhead.  And it's like, what are you going to do?  Yeah, nothing will happen.  Yeah.  Hey, Piggy, what are you going to do, bitch?  Yeah.  Give me your glasses.  I'm going to smash him.  Don't do that shit, Sal. 
[03:54:30]  That's Piggy in there.  I got Piggy's back because he was helpful at WrestleMania.  Okay?  All right.  Don't break his glasses.  I won't.  And definitely don't smash him with a boulder.  No.  I'm going to go over to the Fox Business office across the street.  And see if John Cena wants to hang out.  Because he's also in his wrestling gear there.  And I love when John Cena's in his yellow t-shirts and stuff.  He's a loser.  Because he always wears his suit.  By the way, if you want to see any more, I did all my wrestling interviews.  If you enjoyed them at all, the whole WrestleMania special is going to be on demand.  That's the whole Radio Row show that Eric and me taped from WrestleMania Radio Row on Friday. 
[03:55:00]  And on YouTube.com slash NotSam.  Already posted.  John Cena, CM Punk, Dolph Ziggler.  Big show interviews.  And there will be more throughout the week and today.  And can this be it for the wrestling for a long time?  Not on the after show, my friend.  Not on the after show.  Like it's enough.  I can't make that commitment to you.  Like it's been the past fucking how many weeks?  One is the answer.  No, it's been a little bit longer.  Well, it's been one intensive week.  Yeah.  It's been intensive.  Just a constant bombardment of wrestling. 
[03:55:30]  And it happened again today, didn't it?  No.  Not the whole after show.  First hour.  Well.  First hour of the show today.  That's when I took a dump.  Yeah, well.  Do you think this will be the last time we talk to Sal?  No.  No, we'll have the same conversation with him in...  Within 52 hours, we'll have the same conversation.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  See you later.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over. </pre>
