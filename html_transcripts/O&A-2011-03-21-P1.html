<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Jim Norton recounting his experience at UFC 128, detailing his encounters with celebrities like Rashad Evans, Kenny Florian, and Ice-T, and describing the brutal knockout of Cro Cop and the emotional reactions of Shogun Rua's entourage.  This was followed by a discussion of a subdued appearance by Opie, Anthony, and Norton at a Don Imus event featuring Sean Hannity and Rob Bartlett, notable for its lack of recording.  The hosts then launched into a lengthy and critical discussion of the U.S. military intervention in Libya, questioning the motives and effectiveness of the operation, as well as Obama's leadership.  This segued into commentary on Charlie Sheen's successful Radio City Music Hall shows, drawing comparisons to Jim Norton's own controversial material, and punctuated by repeated jokes about a CNN reporter's speech impediment.  A request for donations to help Dr. Steve financially was also made.

The broadcast continued with a prank recounted on Opie, involving a false claim that Charlie Sheen wanted Opie to open for him. This led to an expletive-laden rant about Charlie Sheenâ€™s behavior, drug use, and lack of professionalism, with reference to a similar rant by Dice Clay (an audio clip of which was planned for later but remained largely undescribed).  Gilbert Gottfried's firing for insensitive tweets about the Japanese tsunami was briefly mentioned. The hosts then mocked the "supermoon" for its lack of significant events, transitioning to a discussion of radiation levels following the Fukushima disaster and the surprisingly high levels of radiation exposure from everyday activities like flying.  A lengthy discussion about the hosts' preparations for a potential disaster ensued, involving humorous banter about bunkers and escape boats.  This was interrupted by an announcement of a surprise engagement from a different program, with an audio clip played (though not described in the excerpts), followed by commentary on the engagement and opinions on teaching, teacher unions, and political correctness. The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion and audio clips of Rebecca Black's "Friday," comparing it to a previous viral video by a former intern, replete with profanity and vulgar commentary.

The next segment opened with a story about an intern wearing expensive clothing who was subsequently hit with a chocolate-covered strawberry aimed at his Gucci boots, after which the intern disappeared. The conversation returned to Rebecca Black's "Friday," with the hosts and callers using highly offensive and sexually suggestive language to criticize the song and the singer.  A listener-submitted video of a marriage proposal at a basketball game was deemed fake, leading to a discussion of Anthony's own inexpensive engagement ring bought while intoxicated. A listener-submitted audio clip of a marriage proposal gone wrong, revealing the proposer's infidelity, prompted further discussion of Rebecca Black, and speculation about R. Kelly. The segment continued with discussion of the movies "Battle Los Angeles," "Buried," and "Paul"; Charlie Sheen's potential return to CBS; a phone call from Anthony's ex-mother-in-law, Judy; a school suspension following a fight; an advertisement for anal sex; and a debate about potato chips versus pretzels, all filled with vulgar and offensive language and interspersed with listener calls and tweets.

A segment focused heavily on potato chips, featuring tales of absurd potato chip-related experiences, including one host's claim of leaving a thumbprint on the Shroud of Turin.  The hosts debated the existence of a truly "bad" potato chip and the excessive noise they create.  This transitioned to a video of a woman firing a Kalashnikov, a discussion about upgrading the show's technology with Skype, and a clip of a crying Kansas State basketball player, Jacob Pullen, leading to speculation on his emotional state and the coach's (Frank Martin) reaction, with a caller, Steve, offering further context.  The discussion broadened to include basketball coaches' theatrics, a critique of Glenn Beck's views on natural disasters and God's will,  a lengthy debate about God, morality, and religion, and the seemingly arbitrary nature of divine justice. The segment concluded with a discussion of an appearance by Peter Riegert from *Animal House*, reminiscing about the film and other movies,  with Drew Boogie as a guest in the studio and Jimmy's announcement of his Boneyard show's time slot change.

The final segment featured a recurring caller, Kenny, who delivered a series of morbid and darkly humorous updates on misfortunes, including death, murder, rape, cancer, suicide, and plane crashes, prompting shock and laughter from the hosts.  Eric Bogosian and a connection to the hockey scene in *The Omen* were mentioned.  The absence of co-host Jimmy, returning on Thursday, was noted, along with discussion of a photo or video of Kenny, speculation about his age and online shopping habits ("bignoses.com"), and a repeated, nonsensical sound ("eee") made by Jimmy.  The segment concluded with the reiteration of the show's name and its airing on SiriusXM.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio. 
[00:04:00]  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructed show.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You're the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made spring of uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How is everyone?  All right.  Yay, Jimmy's back.  Jimmy's back.  Yay.  For today.  What?  For today.  I'm doing the Tonight Show tomorrow and Chelsea Wednesday.  And I'm all next week I'm here.  Busy B.  Yeah.  Jimmy continues to be busy.  My long run of being away ends. 
[00:05:00]  I'm gone two days this week, one day next week, and then I'm back for good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, well, we miss you.  I hate not being here.  I know it's nice to have me away a little bit, but this is too much.  But you're away doing big things for yourself.  Yes, you know.  Becoming a big star.  A big star.  Right in front of our eyes.  I'm still a zilch, but it's nice to just build a little bit more.  Yeah.  Just a little bit more.  I got to promote my dumb CD.  Thanks a lot.  What was I going to say?  Oh, we were just talking about the fights. 
[00:05:30]  We should talk about that for a couple minutes.  UFC 128.  Tremendous.  Jimmy went.  I had other things I had to do, but I certainly watched all the fights Saturday night, and  wow, this Jon Jones is the real deal, huh?  Oh, is he good, man?  I honestly, as much as, I know he's a great fighter.  I didn't think he was going to win.  I thought Shogun was going to fucking, I picked, here's what a phony I am.  I picked Jon Jones, but I was talking to enough people who were like, ugh, Shogun is fucking  deadly.  And my friend watched him train and said, man, he kicks so hard, he'll kill you if he kicks 
[00:06:00]  you.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I picked Jon Jones.  And I kind of wavered.  I picked Jon Jones just because we interviewed the guy.  Yeah.  You know, if you come on our show, then okay, we pick you.  We like you, man.  Simple as that.  But Jon Jones tore him apart.  Shogun was never in that fight.  I couldn't believe what a fucking beating he gave Shogun.  I couldn't believe that beating.  And what?  He's 23?  The youngest light heavyweight?  Ever.  Champion, yeah.  I think he's...  Youngest ever light heavyweight champion in UFC history. 
[00:06:30]  23 years old.  He's only doing it a few years, too.  He's only had 12 fights or something, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Never really been tested.  They throw him up against Shogun, and he just tore him apart.  Shogun was never in that.  I was sitting behind Rashad Evans.  Yeah.  Dana gave us amazing seats.  Of course.  And we were...  He's the best.  And we were right behind Rashad Evans and this guy, Kenny Florian.  And they kept...  Because Rashad was supposed to fight him, but he got hurt.  And it's like, I'm watching that.  You can't be happy.  No.  Watching that guy.  Like, that's who you have to fight.  And so Rashad's going to fight Jon Jones, you think? 
[00:07:00]  I think he's next year.  They're going to set that up?  I believe he's next year.  Were you close to Ice-T?  Because that's all I saw on the pay-per-view.  Ice-T and his lovely...  Is it a wife?  Yeah.  Long-term girlfriend, wife Coco?  No.  I saw them walk in, but I was sitting ringside.  Like, they had...  They were right outside that area.  Mm-hmm.  But...  They were in every shot.  Were they?  As the fighters were coming to the, you know, the cage.  I was...  Every shot they were in.  I was sitting behind Rogan.  Like, Rogan was probably three seats ahead of me.  Oh, you were down below this time?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Which I didn't expect to be.  Because usually we're on that first...  First level.  First row of the second level, if that makes sense.  Yeah.  Which is a better seat, because you're as high as the cage.  I was with my nephew and his friend and my sister and Kenny and his son.  But they were up...  There were only three of us on the floor.  The seats they sit were very tight.  They didn't have as many seats this time.  Right, right.  But we were a couple of people behind Rogan.  Oh, shit.  Just a little bit off to the side.  I didn't see you.  Yeah, I was in there with a burgundy sweatshirt.  It was horrendous.  I probably should have saw you on the pay-per-view. 
[00:08:00]  It was horrendous.  Yeah, you saw me at one...  There's one...  I have to be in it at one point.  Because what?  You're strangling Joe Rogan as he's trying to do his job?  Yeah, I was just licking his ear, hoping that somebody would help us.  But I was so...  You know, I was sitting behind Cro-Cop's...  That side of the ring where Cro-Cop was...  Where his ring side was, I was like three back there.  Man, the Cro-Cop knockout.  He was out cold before he hit the canvas or whatever they call it in the UFC.  That was a rough... 
[00:08:30]  He got knocked out and then falls.  And the first part of the body to hit the floor was his head.  Oh, one of those.  Is there like a gush of just sweat and blood flying out of his head?  After the hit, you saw his leg buckle.  You knew he was out cold.  And then the first part to hit the floor was his face with no hands or nothing to brace himself.  Because he was out.  It's amazing to see those powerful guys.  Because it's not like a sap is getting in there, getting his ass kicked.  Like, we've seen these guys.  They're big, powerful. 
[00:09:00]  Just get their fucking asses handed to them.  Do you see how close...  Do you see where I am right there behind those guys?  Oh, man.  Can you see where I am?  Those guys?  Oh, yeah.  I was sitting behind Shogun's...  I don't know.  They might have been family.  They were Brazilian guys.  And there was like five of them in front of me.  And they had all like white on.  And after he lost...  Because, you know, they were being nice.  They weren't being dicks.  Yeah.  But they were just...  They were so...  It was weird to watch his people as he's getting the shit beat out of them.  Oh, right, right.  Oh, my God.  It can't be comfortable for them. 
[00:09:30]  Dude, they were fucking...  They were like...  Their energy was slowly waning as they realized, like, this guy's really beating him.  Yeah.  And after it was over, they were all just kind of stunned.  And one of the guys was crying.  I felt really bad for them.  Oh, damn.  It was probably his family.  Crying because that could be the end of Crow Cop.  36 years old.  No, no, no, Shogun.  Oh, I mean, Shogun.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Crow Cop is done.  But Shogun's people were fucking crying because they were watching him lose their belt slowly.  Right, right.  Exactly.  Yes.  Yeah, Crow Cop, I think Dana said he's done.  I think he's finished.  Oh, really?  Finished?  Yeah, I think so.  That's about it for him. 
[00:10:00]  36.  Damn, man.  How old is Shogun?  I don't know, actually.  Is he getting up there now, too?  I don't think he's that old.  Is he like, Marge?  Like, 28, 29?  Okay.  Marge, you have a good time.  Oh, I loved it.  I didn't see you.  Where were you?  He was probably a little further back than you.  Hope so.  Just a little bit.  Just a little further.  How far back do they put you?  20th row.  20th row on what?  That first level?  Yeah, on the first level.  Off the floor?  Yeah, I know exactly where it was.  It was all right.  It was decent.  You want better seats next time? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, he wants better seats.  It was just all right?  You can tell.  It's all right.  Really?  You want to talk to the guys that were way up in the rafters for a few hundred dollars?  There were a lot up there, too, man.  There's a lot of people behind you.  That's all you need to worry about.  You were on the lowest level besides the floor, but just 20 rows.  Yeah.  It's hard to see sometimes because of the cameras and stuff like that.  There's always guys standing there with cameras.  Yeah, but you got the big screens all over the place.  So you go there and watch TV, which is neat.  That's what you do at most sporting events now, because the TVs have gotten so large 
[00:11:00]  and so clear.  Yeah, yeah.  You're not looking at a...  At a lot of these sporting events, you go just to watch TV.  Yeah.  I kept making myself look into the ring.  I'm like, you're right here.  It's an instinct to look up.  Yeah, yeah.  Then once in a while, if they're behind one of the posts and you just can't, you have  to...  Then you look up.  But yeah, I made myself look into the ring.  Oh, those fucking kicks.  You can hear them when you're that close.  Oh, really?  That meaty slap of a foot.  Yeah, John Jones.  You just know.  John Jones knows how to kick, huh?  He doesn't do everything.  You see how fast that kick is?  I don't know shit about this stuff, but I... 
[00:11:30]  I do know this.  He seems to kick really quickly.  Yes.  He does everything.  Is that true, Mark?  Yes.  And the spinning elbow, very fast.  Right.  This guy is very fast.  You couldn't get...  Like, usually we were talking before that...  Again, just a guy with 84-inch reach or whatever, you can get in on...  Like, once you break that reach and get in on him, it's probably harder for him.  But not with Jones, because you'd get in on him and he'd knee you in the face or elbow  you.  He'd spin and elbow you.  Yeah, you did say 84-inch reach.  I think so, right?  That is just unbelievable.  He had, what, eight and a half inches off Shogun? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Eight and a half more inches of reach than Shogun.  How do you fucking fight that?  And you know what happened to him during the day?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, is that true?  Oh, yeah.  An hour before the fight.  I read that yesterday.  Oh, right.  He took down a guy that was breaking into a car.  Yeah, and the woman screamed or whatever.  Yeah.  And his two trainers are running after the guy.  And Jones chased.  And he's like, I got kind of gazelle-legged.  So he passed them.  Just bolted past them.  Grabs the guy.  What a bad fucking, what bad timing on the part of this guy that was breaking into a car. 
[00:12:30]  Was there a thwarting that happened?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He took them down.  As he was running, Jones said that the guy looked back.  And Jones said, you know I'm going to catch you, right?  And the guy tripped over his own feet.  He just panicked.  You know he's able to tell him, you know I'm going to catch you.  Was this in Newark?  Oh, yeah.  This was in Patterson.  Patterson, New Jersey.  Patterson, New Jersey.  He was going to a park to meditate.  Why would you go to a park in Patterson to meditate?  Can't you use your hotel room?  I know.  They got waterfalls at this park.  Oh.  He likes to be with nature before. 
[00:13:00]  Well, he, ooh.  Because what I read, too, that he had put him in some hold.  Yep, wait for cops.  And waited for the cops.  And then his trainer, he actually, the trainers came by and said, all right, look, you know,  we don't need you getting into shit with this guy.  So the trainers took over and put him in some fucking hold where this guy must have been  like, why, why these guys?  Yeah.  Out of anyone.  He got knocked down by the light heavyweight champion. 
[00:13:30]  Not even a guy who can fight.  Yeah.  The guy who was about to win the belt.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is, but I love this John Jones.  Dude, you know who told me about it right before the fight?  Ari Shafir was there.  Right.  And when I heard that, I'm like, this fucking guy, that's a weird karma thing.  I'm like, ah, that's too good of a story for him not to win now.  And he was just really cool on the phone.  He had a great vibe about him.  Yeah.  He looks like he's going to be the real deal.  Oh, he's going to last a long time.  In the UFC.  Yes.  Yeah, you could just tell, right?  Mark my words.  He's going to be there for a long time. 
[00:14:00]  Who beat him?  He lost one fight.  He only lost on fucking illegal strike.  I beat him.  Elbow strike.  Oh, what's that?  He was disqualified.  Oh, he was disqualified.  He's a very violent man.  How do you throw an illegal elbow?  Well, you could throw spiking down.  They don't want you to spike the elbow down.  Because that could just pretty much take your face off, right?  Yeah, it could probably kill you.  Really?  Yeah.  So they'd rather you swing the elbow.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  You've got to kind of swing.  And that's what we were talking about Friday. 
[00:14:30]  What happened?  When Liddell was in about the elbows and shit.  No, Strikeforce still allows.  Strikeforce was not allowing elbows at all.  Not allowing elbows.  Right, right.  That's what we were talking about.  At all.  Yeah.  Yeah, because we were discussing what are the changes going to be now that Strikeforce was  blocked by the UFC.  And that's what it was, the elbow thing.  We were talking about Friday's show.  A lot of people over the weekend.  Because it was a great fucking show here Friday with Rogan and Penn Jillette.  Penn Jillette came in.  Two guys that really know how to talk. 
[00:15:00]  It's fucking fantastic.  And are really good at it.  Yeah, they're interesting guys both of you.  They're really good.  And then I realized, it's like, oh yeah, Chuck Liddell was here too.  He sat here.  He was having a great time.  He's laughing his ass off.  He's just, ah, but he just sat there.  You know who said that?  Liddell.  I saw him at the event.  I walked up.  And he goes, man, that fucking show is hilarious.  He just started talking about how much fun he had on the show.  Yeah.  And how Joe and Penn, he goes, they didn't even fucking need me.  I was just sitting there.  He just started tweeting. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he was tweeting and laughing.  He was tweeting.  Checking out his Twitter.  It was a little fuck of a lot of fun.  Yeah, but that was the first thing he said to me.  He really loved the show and he had fun.  He just said how funny.  People love how guys can just go and free form and be funnier.  Yeah, we talked to him though.  And then he decided to hang.  He could have left.  He obviously could have left, but he was having a good time.  No, he was having a good time, man.  And everybody was.  Shit, we stayed an hour later.  It's 11 o'clock, yeah.  Yeah.  So people were also tweeting things like, oh, that 20 minutes from Thursday's show paid  in full.  That's right. 
[00:16:00]  That's right it was.  See, we made up.  Although the Ian Halpern segment was one for the ages, too.  It took a while to get us going on that one, but we made that work in the end.  How was Imus?  I was bummed I missed that.  Imus was good.  I saw your photos backstage.  Imus was good.  I was really bummed.  Yeah, but I was bummed that it wasn't recorded for anything.  It wasn't?  No.  It was for nothing.  It was for like 200 people at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Most of them, certainly not our fans, a lot older.  He didn't tape it?  No, and I even said that to him backstage. 
[00:16:30]  I'm like, why aren't you taping this and then play a few clips on your show, make your  next radio show easy?  You would think, right?  No tape, no TV, no radio.  Wow.  It was strange.  It's just there in the fucking space.  It was for a good cause of charity.  Yeah.  Those people paid money to be there.  Who was there?  Imus apparently is pretty paranoid about things being taped.  Yeah, but I told him everyone has smartphones.  They're taping anyway.  Yeah.  Well, we're trying to make sure they're not doing that.  I'm like, trust me, they're doing that. 
[00:17:00]  Who was there?  Me, Anthony, and Hannity.  Hannity.  And Rob Bartlett doing stand-up.  And I think they had some Jersey Boys singing or something.  Jersey Boys singing.  Dude, I don't even know if we brought this up.  When we left, there was a comic on stage.  It sounded like a seminar.  It sounded like he was just giving a seminar from the reaction from people.  He was getting nothing.  It's a tough room, though.  I know.  They're all just sitting down. 
[00:17:30]  Old Imus fan people.  It was the calmest St. Paddy's Day crowd I've ever seen.  They're all just sitting down.  I thought it was a podcast.  No, that's what we thought.  We thought at first it was going to be the TV and radio thing.  And then we're like, oh, I think he's radio.  And then, oh, I think he's recording it for radio.  And then we just realized, as somebody said, it amounts to vaudeville.  We're just getting on stage.  We sat down at a small round table with Imus and Hannity and me and Opie. 
[00:18:00]  And Imus just kind of interviewed us.  Kind of asked us questions about our careers and our beliefs in certain things.  Where we lean politically.  And, you know, just the lifestyle shit.  It was cool.  It was great.  It was funny.  We were laughing.  But it was very odd.  And fucking Imus could still interview.  He could still do his thing.  He can.  That's just it, man.  He got a lot of big laughs.  That is it.  There's some MMA footage. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, that's the show right there from the top.  They're showing John Jones.  Damn, man.  Locally here in New York.  Dude, he's just, he was so, those knees.  God, don't fuck that.  How do you take a knee like that?  Oh.  How do you take that knee and continue fighting?  Shogun's a tough dude, man.  Hey, you know what?  This is kind of cool because they don't really cover UFC locally when they do sports.  Yes, Mars.  Mars.  Well, they did it now because of the local aspect of it, of him catching the rubber.  Oh, so the UFC guy's got to, like, you know, thwart some kind of crime before their big 
[00:19:00]  match.  And then local sports will cover it.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Well, Dana mentioned it, actually, at the press conference because this Bob Riley is a guy,  I think he's an assemblyman.  He's the one who, I don't know how he's continually stopping MMA from being legal in New York, but  he's a, he's fucking despicable, this guy.  Asshole.  It's his own personal view.  What is his view?  He just doesn't like it.  We got boxing.  But he, according to what I've heard, he would outlaw that if he could.  He's probably a pussy.  He just doesn't like that stuff. 
[00:19:30]  And it's the millions of, and Sheldon Silver's another one.  I mean, I'm not going to go on a political rant, but these guys are the ones who I think  believe stopping it from being legal here.  Millions of dollars.  Because literally, it's 15 minutes into Jersey.  You can go and see an amazing event.  Yeah, so just picture all that money, and you're moving it 15 minutes to Jersey.  Yeah.  In New York City, and we certainly could use the money.  Yeah, Fan Expo money.  They're going to raise our taxes because these scumbags won't allow something like this to  be legal.  It's disgraceful.  A lot of these guys get a little nervous inside when they see men shirtless. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Ripped, you know, with a lot of muscles.  They get, a lot of these guys get a little confused about feelings they might get when they  see that.  And they don't want it in their city, a lot of people.  That's, you know, I've heard tell.  I'd love to know why, but that's the only way for it to be legal is for people just to  continually bombard these guys with calls.  Yeah.  And it's embarrassing that it's not legal in New York. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, it is.  No, it is.  That's ridiculous.  It's fucking New York.  It makes martial arts.  You can't do it in the garden.  It's politics.  Yeah.  Red tape.  They probably want their taste.  Yeah, they want something.  I would assume they want their taste.  I would assume there's still some kind of corruption going on in this fucking city.  It wouldn't surprise me.  Please.  It wouldn't surprise me a bit.  Because I'm sure boxing gives them a little taste.  Yeah.  We've hung out with Don King.  I think that guy hands out tastes.  I would love it to be revealed.  I'm just assuming.  I don't know shit, but.  No, I'm guessing with you. 
[00:21:00]  From Shinola?  Yeah.  Because Dana White knows how to run a company.  Yeah.  He's a stand-up guy that really knows how to run a company and really has turned this into  a sport that a lot of people want to check out now.  And it's now the, it's the only game in town as far as like, it's like the NFL or the NBA  or NASCAR or hockey, NHL.  There's only one.  And then you can, maybe that's bad for negotiating, but it's better for.  Well, what does this guy say?  What does this guy want?  I don't know what his argument is. 
[00:21:30]  I heard he's pleaded his case and he's just, I think it's become, my opinion is it's become  his cause.  I think once it becomes your cause.  You can't back down.  And then you can't back down and you fight for it because it's a personal thing and you  lose, then you've lost.  And it's just sickening.  It's legal.  McCain fought it too at one point years ago.  I guess when it was more violent years ago.  Oh, he's probably has, he probably watches it and goes, oh yeah, I remember that blow.  That move.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That's the tell us the coordinates move.  But I mean, McCain, at least it was a much different sport eight years ago than it is 
[00:22:00]  now.  Is this guy for real?  He's mad that you're bragging over your seats, Jimmy.  Bill in Philly.  Are you for real, Bill?  Gentlemen, good morning.  Good morning.  I'm tired of hearing Jimmy brag about his great seats.  Anybody can buy those cheap seats.  I hear him brag about his seats on Continental.  He's an ass.  He's a comedian.  But I'm not, but I'm not really bragging.  I'm actually.  Do you think he's.  Welcome back, Jimmy, by the way.  By the way, the seats were given to me, so I'm kind of saying that Dana really hooked  us up. 
[00:22:30]  Brag.  If I bought them, I would be bragging.  Why don't listeners get the basics of the show?  Is he still here?  No, he hung up right away.  Obviously, you guys joke about.  Oh, my God.  He's just jealous.  What's the matter?  Jealous, baby.  He wants to get me started.  He's a jealous baby.  But no, bragging is if you bought them.  If I said I spent $2,000 on a seat.  I got the best seats.  No, it's like, hey, look.  Look what Dana did.  It was a gift from Dana.  I liked hearing that you sat that close to Joe Rogan and you had a different perspective  on the whole fucking event. 
[00:23:00]  Unbelievable.  The whole night.  Loved it.  That's why I like hearing that.  Yeah.  But, sir, you can continue to watch from the top.  Watch from the top.  Watch from the top.  It's the only major sport in my life we've ever been.  We've never been taken care of by anybody like this.  No.  I was thinking it on the way home.  They're the only guys that have really taken good care of us.  Yeah.  Is these UFC and Dana and Reed and all those guys.  The only ones.  Yeah.  I think you're correct with that.  Fucking baseball.  They want us to buy tickets even though NFL and, you know, MLB was on. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Terrible.  Whatever.  But, you know what I mean?  They were all kind of, all the sporting guys were dicks except for, except for.  The UFC.  Yeah.  Those guys were phenomenal.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  They had a very successful event Saturday night.  And I was watching the fighters.  Like Rashad was getting pulled aside by a million people.  And there was, and Kenny Florian was.  And all the, every, Dana, they literally had interviews to do. 
[00:24:00]  And they were just, they couldn't, they couldn't say no to fans.  They're all cool, right?  And I said, Dana's head of security was there.  You see that guy with the white hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  And I said, this is why this is so successful.  Successful.  Because these guys are fucking fans.  And he's like, every time they never say no to fans.  Well, I just thought, I hope that never goes away.  You know, as they get more and more successful.  Because that is a nice touch.  You see it, that these guys take their fans very seriously.  And when you look at, it all shit rolls down.  And they don't deny anyone unless they really have somewhere to go.  They have to go. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  Shit rolls downhill, as they say.  And it all comes from Dana.  And he's fucking, he's great.  Dude, your Yankees are just like that.  We saw that firsthand.  They're all roped off at a charity event.  At a charity event, we couldn't even get close to them to get pictures.  Dude, XM paid $25,000 for the table.  But our table was behind the ropes.  Behind the ropes.  Yeah, it was a good old, fuck you.  Wow, if you look at the players.  So even when you go to a charity event where your company, certainly we didn't pay the money,  spends easily $25,000.  It was probably more if you had everything up.  And you still can't get pictures with the Yankees. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Fucking scumbags.  They are scumbags.  Most athletes are just, I can't, they're hateable.  Officially, I don't think I'm a baseball fan anymore.  I've said for years I'm a Mets fan, but I'm not, I don't think I'm a baseball fan anymore.  At all, yeah.  No, I don't think so.  I'll go to a couple of Phillies games because the in-laws are really into the Phillies.  They're way into the Phillies more than I'm into the Mets, so I'll take in a few games this year.  The Mets have a few more problems than just the games this season coming up.  I still haven't been to their new stadium. 
[00:25:30]  I went to Yankee Stadium before the new Shea Stadium.  You might have to start selling it off to pay for the fucking Bernie Madoff bullshit that went on.  I call it the new Shea Stadium.  I don't care what bank is it named after.  Shitty Field.  Oh, that's right.  Citi Field.  Right, right, right, right.  How much did they lose the Mets?  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  It's a big scandal.  They're not even sure of a figure, but it's just, it's a situation where they're trying to sell part of the team,  but not any kind of controlling interest. 
[00:26:00]  So people that would want to entertain buying in on the Mets just kind of look and go,  well, so I give you money, and it just pretty much becomes I can go to the games?  Like, they have no say in players or how the teams run or anything,  because they won't give up a controlling interest in the Mets,  but they need fucking capital.  They need money.  I mean, they're not going to be able to pay fucking players at this point.  Boy, I wonder if that boils down to. 
[00:26:30]  I wonder if the fans are going to be spending more at the ballpark.  Yeah, yeah.  Your tickets are now $6,000 for upper mezzanine.  I love how it always comes down to us to take care of the situation.  For their fuck-ups.  Ridiculous.  But they would never give you a discount if the investments were fucking paid.  No, no, no, no.  No.  What else is going on?  I guess the Japan situation is back to normal, right?  Oh, I guess so.  I turned on the news all weekend long, and they moved on to Libya. 
[00:27:00]  Libya is the big story.  That's got to mean that all of Japan is rebuilt and back to normal.  I guess, running like clockwork.  That's what I love about the news, the fake compassion for everybody.  And then, as soon as that next big story hits, they fucking clear out.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  You were going to interview me next.  It went from showing that tsunami footage to showing those cruise missiles launching off of that ship.  They forgot all about Japan.  20 times an hour.  How many missiles? 
[00:27:30]  110 missiles?  110 cruise missiles.  Now, what's the price?  Because that went around like crazy.  That's got to be $50, $60 a piece.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  I heard anywhere from $600,000 to $1 million a piece.  Yeah, depending on what kind of cruise missile it is.  Wow.  Some of those things can just hang out and loiter for a while and then decide, oh, we'll hit that target.  Yeah.  And then they're all autonomous, so you just set them off.  It's fire and forget.  And then, yeah, they've been trying to take out, I guess, the air defense capabilities of Libya so that Gaddafi can't start bombing the shit out of the rebellion. 
[00:28:00]  Well, yeah, the rebels were in deep trouble.  Yeah.  And did I read this correctly?  France?  France is actually going to be taking the lead on this.  Yeah, they're sending in some planes to enforce the no-fly zone.  When was the last time France did anything?  You would know this one.  It's been a while.  They're never members of a coalition.  Never, right? 
[00:28:30]  They like staying out of things.  So what's their interest in Libya?  I don't know this.  I guess they have a big interest in Libya.  I'm not even sure what it is.  Yeah, I don't know.  They're interested.  I kept reading France is taking the lead.  I'm like, France?  Really?  Yeah.  And Obama and company keep insisting that we are only in this for the short haul, for the beginning,  because we have certain tactical advantages and technology that these other countries don't.  So we're going to be handing the reins over to either England or France in the coming days. 
[00:29:00]  We were just here in the beginning for the cruise missile technology.  How much, by the way, I'm completely against us being involved in any way, shape, or form.  Yeah, yeah.  Once again, the mother-in-law has to stick her fucking face in where it doesn't belong.  And how about this, pussy United States?  We really want to kill Gaddafi?  How about the next time he's here for the UN, instead of letting him set up a tent somewhere,  how about you go after him and Ahmadinejad from Iran?  How about that?  We don't kill more leaders.  We don't kill leaders. 
[00:29:30]  Have you been watching the news, Jimmy?  That's policy.  We don't kill leaders.  We are not targeting Gaddafi.  We don't do that.  We're targeting command and control centers.  That's right.  Even though we did hit a building in his compound.  Well.  But they said that had what they, and I love how they said it.  They didn't say command and control or anything.  What they said was, the building we hit in his compound was a building that did contain certain equipment that could be used for communicating with,  and the second I heard that was, it's a building with a phone. 
[00:30:00]  And they just bombed a building because it had a phone in it.  And maybe Gaddafi was close.  And maybe Gaddafi was on the phone.  But we don't go after world leaders, Jimmy.  But we don't go after leaders.  I think that's where they keep the vending machines.  They want to knock out the soda machines.  He was going in there for a Kit Kat.  A Kit Kat and a Sprite.  He was a little hungry.  Yeah.  A Snickers.  Really satisfied.  And he was hungry.  You know.  But we don't do that.  He had a hankering.  He had a hankering.  The other countries do that.  We don't do that.  No, we don't assassinate.  We don't assassinate world leaders.  Yeah.  Especially our own. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So.  Whatever you want to believe on that one.  So that's like the big story.  Some people think, you know.  Yeah, they haven't heard from him since a telephoned.  Oh, really?  A statement that he made a couple of days ago.  Mm-hmm.  And so I guess he's keeping low.  He's been on TV for hours on end for a few days.  But after the bombing started.  And then last night, I think there might have been some F-117s involved and some takeouts of some key targets.  Not sure. 
[00:31:00]  I think the latest France is kind of tooling around up there and nothing's going on.  Yeah, yeah.  They got the airspace now, right?  They own the air.  They pretty much told the Iraqi, the Libyan Navy to stay in port.  They said specifically, if you leave port, you will be destroyed.  Wow.  So, and Gaddafi was being very obstinate about the whole thing, saying, I'm doing what I want.  We will fight.  We will kill civilians.  We will do that.  But he hasn't said anything.  He seems to be really slick. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I thought this would be an easy one.  He's wily.  He's certainly wily.  Let's say he's a little wily.  Yes.  I had a cabbie.  I came here yesterday to do some little taping for the Boneyard for the week.  And a cabbie was driving me.  We were talking about, and he starts talking about Libya.  And he goes, the U.S. is, it was African.  And he was saying how we were just there for the oil.  And I'm so against us being there.  I was like, yeah, maybe.  But I was like, what about, I'm like, I think we're more there because we're embarrassed that Al McGregor, whatever his name was, the Pan Am bomber was released. 
[00:32:00]  Right.  And we don't have the fucking balls, the fucking balls to have economic sanctions or cut relations with Scotland, who released him.  Right.  Or better yet, England, who fucking, who brokered his release, I believe.  Or fucking, how about BP, if they're behind it?  How about we kick him out of the fucking country?  And it was to make some kind of a deal.  Of course it was.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy said, oh, he was dying of cancer.  And they let him go.  Apparently, he had like the flu. 
[00:32:30]  And he's fine now.  Well, they let him go a while ago now, right?  Yeah, over a year ago, I think.  Well over a year ago.  Is it well over a year ago?  A year and a half, I want to say.  This guy was on death's door, as far as they said.  Well, they said he had weeks to live when they released him.  Yeah.  You know how I know?  Because it was when the Jay Leno show was starting, one of the pre-shows, before it actually went to air at 10 o'clock, that was one of the topics we were talking about, was this guy being released.  That's how long ago that was.  Humanitarian reasons, they let him go.  What kind of bullshit is that?  And these civilians are the same people that were cheering his return. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So I don't care what happens in that country.  It's not our business.  I don't like we're just showing all of a sudden now we're going to get involved.  We could have killed him years ago and we didn't.  Tough shit for us.  I also don't like the fact that we don't know who the fuck this rebellion is.  Like, who's in charge of this?  It could be the same thing as Gaddafi.  Worse than Gaddafi.  Is it Muslim Brotherhood?  Is it, you know, everyone's got a nice acronym.  Uh, that sounds all nice and sweet, but who the fuck are these people?  Why are we, why are we helping them out? 
[00:33:30]  This is what they're saying.  We're doing this to keep civilians from being massacred.  Ugh.  No other reason.  Uh, he's, he, Gaddafi is in there murdering civilians.  Uh, and we're not there to support, uh, revolution.  We're there to save civilians.  That's bullshit.  Bullshit.  Oh, well, it can't be any worse than Gaddafi.  Uh, for their own people.  But, but those, those people have to rise up on their own and beat or get beaten. 
[00:34:00]  Um, there are some ways to support.  I mean, obviously our, our own revolution was supported by the France, by the French.  Right.  You know, they came in and helped us out and.  But we'll make sure we get one of our guys in there.  We'll make sure we get one of our guys in Egypt.  I don't know.  Uh, the Middle East is hard to slip a puppet into.  I will.  Very difficult.  We'll make sure.  We'll probably.  The Shah, the Shah was the last one, I think.  Nah, we'll probably.  Ooh, that didn't end nicely.  We'll prop someone up.  By the way, when we helped, when France helped us, had we killed, through a terrorist act, 
[00:34:30]  uh, 200 of fucking France's citizens 20 years earlier?  Right.  I don't think this history was the same.  Yeah.  And the fucking bile between the two countries wasn't the same.  You're right.  You're right.  Uh, the connection with France, too, they get 30% of their oil from Libya, I guess.  Oh, okay.  I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna believe a listener that just wrote that.  Yeah, it's probably true.  It's probably true on that one.  Yeah, because I do remember hearing that they do have a great deal with Libya and oil, and  I think that's why England handed over, or Scotland handed over the, uh.  Of course it is.  Yeah, terrorists.  It's for some oil deal, and I don't know. 
[00:35:00]  But how about we just, we mind our business.  Let's mind, I don't care, you know where our money should be going?  A, to stop fucking people here for taxes.  Yeah.  Is how about we, I don't mind helping people in Japan or Indonesia during these quakes.  That's when we should be spending money.  Helping fucking humanitarian aid.  We're working up to a $5 trillion deficit.  Nice.  Which is numbers that no one can even comprehend.  It's those huge numbers you can't wrap your mind around.  $5 trillion deficit is right around the corner. 
[00:35:30]  And we're helping out people we don't know in Libya for what?  I don't know.  That means we're in the $4 trillions, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So what's the difference between the $4 trillion and the $5 trillion?  We're in upper fours.  The number's so large, who cares?  Well, that's why they're able to keep going with this.  Because people just go, I don't even know what that number means.  And if you owed the government $5,000, they would throw you in jail.  Yeah, that is.  Let's go to Jay in Nevada. 
[00:36:00]  Jay.  Hey, you guys were just saying last week, you guys were giving them the president.  Not you.  Not Jay.  Not you guys.  I'm so sick of everyone being the same person on this show.  Anthony was.  All right.  And what makes the show very easy on you, Anthony, will never accept President Obama.  And I do have an asshole douchebag.  I do have fucking reasoning behind that.  Obama waited a fucking...  Hey, he waited a month before he did anything. 
[00:36:30]  When these rebels...  When this humanitarian effort that he's pulling off now, it's been a month, and then you decide  to do something, there's no...  You ever heard better late than never?  Oh, he got you with the better late than never.  Oh, he got me better late than never.  Oh, shit.  The guy is not a leader.  He's not a leader.  He doesn't know how to fucking lead.  He doesn't have any passion for anything but having gotten elected as president and taking 
[00:37:00]  him, his wife, and his kids on trips to Brazil.  Shut up!  Well, the kids are off.  It rules.  But the kids...  Anthony, the kids are off for spring break, and they decided...  Whatever.  ...they want to see that big Christ statue.  He really...  You have to say...  Even if you like Obama, you got to say...  One of you guys pointed out that he's not used to having guys' lives in his hands.  No!  And that, to me, is where... 
[00:37:30]  If he'd have been a governor first, he'd be better at stuff like this.  I don't know who pointed that out, but it was a great point.  He's not comfortable reacting when people can get killed.  He can't make...  He can't make...  He can't make quick decisions on very, very important subjects and topics.  His social programs...  Oh, he's ready to jump on those and everything.  But when it comes down to world matters, and people said they criticized this guy before  he got in office that he's got no, zero experience in world affairs, dealing with other countries. 
[00:38:00]  He did some tomahawking over the weekend, though.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I bet he did it.  He did.  He signed off on it.  He had to sign the order.  His name's on something.  Whatever.  However, he still is not a leader.  He's not a world leader.  He's not a world powerhouse.  And again, I'm not saying America should be the world police, but in this world that  we live in, we need to take the lead, at least philosophically sometimes, maybe have 
[00:38:30]  an impassioned speech that'll give people an idea as to what the fuck you're doing, what  the fuck this is about.  Even Michael Moore was ripping fucking Obama apart on this one.  Michael fucking Moore!  I don't pay attention.  I started following Michael Moore just to get angry.  Really?  Yeah.  I follow some people just to piss myself off.  Well, that's why I follow Kim Kardashian.  See, we're the same person.  Yes.  You follow Kardashian.  Is she awful on Twitter?  She has to be awful.  I follow her just to piss yourself off. 
[00:39:00]  Just to piss myself off.  Why not?  And then I attack her on her tweets.  That's what I do.  And you do that with Michael Moore.  I do that with Michael Moore.  We're the same person.  I don't attack.  I'm just kind of like, I'm just dipping my feet in the water here with him as far as  what he tweets.  Did Obama win the Nobel Peace Prize?  I'm trying to remember.  Yes.  Yeah, he won the Nobel Prize for...  Not very peaceful this weekend.  No, a few cruise missiles.  The whole world is a joke.  You win the Nobel Peace Prize and here's a guy that just fucking signed some kind of order  to launch 110 fucking Tomahawk missiles. 
[00:39:30]  Well, he didn't win the Nobel.  He won the You're Not Bush Award.  Yeah.  That was all that was.  That's what that was.  That was the world saying, we hated Bush so much, here you are.  You can't win any peace prize and launch missiles within the same year.  I forgot who wrote...  You can't do that.  I forgot who wrote the initial tweet, but it was retweeted by Andy Levy.  Yeah.  And it was like, uh-oh, here come the anti-Obama war protests in three, two, never.  Oh, really?  Which is just brilliant because it'll never happen. 
[00:40:00]  You won't see Obama's war for oil, Obama's killing civilians, Obama this, that.  You're not going to see that.  It's covered differently.  They're still blaming this one on George W.  I don't want to protect Libyan civilians.  I don't either.  Listening to that cabbie talk about how we're only there for the oil, that's the mentality  of it.  And it's like, you know what?  Go fuck yourselves.  And once in a while, Muslims will tweet me or whatever and think, how come you hate  us?  And I really don't.  It's not about Muslims.  Oh, you're carrying on conversations with Muslims? 
[00:40:30]  What else is going back and forth between you and Muslims?  We're discussing plans.  Just plans for a party.  They've got me.  I'm going to infiltrate.  Oh, are you?  No, but it's not about that.  It's about people that I deem anti-U.S. that don't like us.  I have no mercy for it.  I don't care.  Don't want us involved.  I don't care about them.  And if Obama would make himself more clear, no one knows really what this is about.  Right.  No one knows what these rebels want. 
[00:41:00]  Even in Egypt, during their uprising, we knew, we got a feel for what these people wanted.  They wanted jobs.  They didn't want to be, they didn't want there to be two classes, the ultra-wealthy and the  dirt-living poor.  And they wanted some kind of a constitution with amendments that gave them certain liberties  and, you know, a life.  At least we knew that. 
[00:41:30]  This, I have no idea why these people want Gaddafi out.  They don't even know.  No one's ever said it.  It's just, woo, everyone else is partying here in the Middle East.  Let's pick up some guns and start shooting at the leadership.  It's a movement across the Middle East.  Yeah.  Because now Syria is acting up.  Yes.  Bahrain.  Yeah.  They're looking for their changes.  Was Yemen had problems?  Why not Yemen?  It's going to happen soon.  Yeah.  Yemen is having its own problems.  In the words of Anthony, why not Yemen?  Why not Yemen?  That's going to happen.  Years ago.  I think in general that part of the world doesn't really know what they want. 
[00:42:00]  They know they want change.  Or it seems like a majority of them do.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't know.  It's what I like to call the clusterfuck.  Is Anderson Cooper going to be okay, though?  Is he now in Libya?  Is he back?  He's taking too many chances.  Can we bring him home?  I'm very nervous for Anderson Cooper.  He should be.  I saw him.  Where was he?  He was in Egypt, then he had to go to Japan.  Is he in Libya now?  Let's bring him home.  He probably is.  That guy needs a vacation. 
[00:42:30]  He's a national treasure.  We've got to protect him.  We've got to protect him.  Him and Shep Smith over at Fox News.  I saw him Friday.  And he was exhausted.  Shep was?  I was like, Shep, you glowing in the dark yet?  Nope.  He was like, oh, jeez.  Oh, you saw him?  Yeah, yeah.  I was walking in.  He was walking out.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I forgot that you have a connection with Fox News.  He was exhausted.  You could just see it.  Really?  Because every time you turned on Fox News, it was Shep.  Three in the morning, noon, three in the afternoon, six o'clock. 
[00:43:00]  The guy was constantly on.  Yeah, but he's the type of guy that looks like he might do a little partying in between  reports, if you know what I mean.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He just seemed like he was on his way home to go to sleep for a week.  Maybe for a week.  I'm too busy watching CNN with the Lispy broad.  You like the Lispy broad?  You haven't been around.  Yeah, I've seen her.  There's a Lispy broad that's doing all the Japanese coverage.  She can't say S's or C's.  And then the mic they're using or the technology they're using, it's some kind of a Skype or 
[00:43:30]  something, makes it even worse.  If you Lisp over the age of 11 at this point, you should fucking have your teeth slammed on  your tongue.  We brought it to a lot of people's attention, and Twitter's alive, where everyone's tweeting  me, hey, she's back on, and thanks to those people, because then I quickly turn on CNN,  and she's just, it's unbelievable.  Do you have tape of her?  I don't know who you mean.  Yeah, if, uh...  Iraq, Iraq's gonna get it, and if we could get more tape of her, it's unbelievable.  Oh, it's awful.  Oh, it's unbelievable. 
[00:44:00]  I love a good impediment.  I love it better than a good impediment.  This makes Big A look like, you know, yeah, like they could be doing Shakespeare.  It's bad.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, Dr., by the fear, I forget, but you said Big A. Dr. Steve had some kind of a link.  I wish he could resend me.  Yeah.  Big A needs some kind of...  I ignore this.  He needs help financially for his medical stuff.  No, does he?  Enough already.  He's 90 pounds.  Enough already.  No, we saw him at the IMAS event.  He looks unbelievable.  So, Dr. Steve, if you could resend that, I will tweet it, and I'm sorry I haven't, but 
[00:44:30]  to help out Big A, who's really, really working on helping himself, if listeners want to help  him out, because he needs medical money, I think, for something.  But it's legit.  Yeah, he's...  Is it legit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, well, he's too legit to quit.  He's just going to gain the weight back.  I keep sending him carrot cakes for the big middle finger on them.  Eat this.  You know you want to.  Dude, he's still...  90 fucking pounds that guy's lost.  He looks really good.  Oh!  I think he's thinner than wood floor liquor. 
[00:45:00]  Wood floor liquor.  You better watch out.  You're next.  At fucking Ant's house, I've seen him before with...  What's he carrying?  Like berries and nuts?  Like some creepy bear?  He does.  He does.  Carries his own little healthy snacks.  Yes.  Very healthy.  All right, here's the list.  He's taking care of himself.  That's good.  See, this is old, unfortunately.  This is when the earthquake first hit.  You haven't been around for the earthquake?  I've been around.  Yeah, yeah.  I was just putting it out.  Then maybe you...  Oh, okay.  Maybe it was...  All right.  If we could get, you know, newer audio from her, this is one of the best things you could 
[00:45:30]  watch on TV.  First one, not as bad.  Second one, really bad.  So, first this one.  We've got the tsunami and we've got the earthquake.  Let's start with the earthquake.  What kind of shape, in fact, is Tokyo in right now?  Well, I can tell you that right now there's an infrastructure problem in Tokyo.  But before I get to that, let me tell you what was a shared experience in the city of  13 million people.  And I just want to give you a small snapshot.  And remember, we are hundreds of miles away from the epicenter of the quake. 
[00:46:00]  Say middle.  Epicenter.  Don't say epicenter.  Say middle.  Epicenter.  That one's not that bad.  That's terrible.  Oh, wait till you hear the second one.  She strings a bunch of S words together.  What is she doing?  I don't know.  What are they doing?  She sounds like she's supposed to be a really good reporter if she didn't have that pesky,  you know, lisp.  Yeah.  And this is just one small snapshot of what people across the city felt.  There were reports of damage of some ceilings falling. 
[00:46:30]  There are many people who felt the shaking for several minutes.  I was in one of Tokyo's busiest train stations, Tokyo Station.  And in that station, we felt the shaking for several minutes.  The train lines were shut down.  This was certainly something sizable.  This was different.  Why would you say certainly something sizable if you can't say S's or C words?  And why would you say that it was, uh, it was, it couldn't, you have to edit out S words 
[00:47:00]  if you can help it.  Don't pluralize anything.  Right.  She's their correspondent in Japan, obviously.  And now that they've moved on to Libya, I'm bummed that we're not going to get the  see or hear her on CNN as much as we have.  So.  Yeah.  Japan's a fucking mess, man.  Oh, yeah.  You think?  I saw some story on a firefighter who went home and his grandkids were all dead.  It was all fucking miserable.  Some miserable news.  Well, I don't understand why they have to like, you know, push that angle. 
[00:47:30]  We all know that a lot of people are dead and just horrible.  You're kidding.  Tragic stories.  Yeah.  It's awful.  They went with one guy that was still searching for his wife.  It's like.  Good luck.  Really?  What are you doing?  Good luck to you.  We know she's dead.  By the way, Japan doesn't need, they keep using you to donate money.  We should, when military guys want to go over there, if they want to help clean up rubble  or whatever it is we do, that's fine.  But Japan doesn't need money.  They don't need the money.  They have money.  We don't need to donate a million dollars.  We're always the ones that's got a, yeah. 
[00:48:00]  They're the third world's, uh, third largest, uh, economy in the world, right?  Yeah.  I think they're okay.  So we can just go over and give them man, manpower or equipment, but they don't need  our fucking money.  No, I don't think so.  Manpower.  But it's fine though.  According to the news, I think Japan's all set and, uh, back to normal.  Yeah.  Because now they're on to Libya showing they don't give a shit in the end.  What's Charlie Sheen doing?  Oh, they actually just, uh, had a Charlie Sheen story too.  So, um, reached his three millionth, uh, Twitter, Twitter follower. 
[00:48:30]  How about that?  And he sold out two nights at Radio City.  That's pretty amazing.  To just, as he said, he's just going to riff, by the way.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He didn't say that.  He did.  What is he doing?  An O&A road show?  Just assuming that they're going to love it?  He's just going to riff.  Oh, it's going to be a disaster.  And, um, kind of go off and just kind of talk.  It's, uh, there's no plan for this thing.  When's the first one?  I don't know.  When is the first one?  Didn't he tweet a picture of his bag? 
[00:49:00]  He's all packed and ready to go?  Yeah, he tweeted a picture of his bag, which is another little familiar thing.  I did a whole fucking show this weekend on my go bag.  Mm-hmm.  I did a compound show on the contents of my go bag.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, and then moments later, Charlie Sheen posts a picture of his go bag.  You think he's watching you?  I don't know what it is.  I'm not one to say, oh, my God, copy, you know, someone's watching, someone's saying something.  But it's just a lot of coincidences going on with that, with Charlie Sheen, like, popping things on. 
[00:49:30]  And I don't know.  It was just odd because it was a very, it was very deliberate.  But, Kenny told me, he goes, uh, I tried to play a prank on you.  I wanted Pete to call you and say that Charlie Sheen had called and they'd asked for you to open for him.  Oh, shit.  I was so, I'm like, what the fuck would be funny about that?  I'd sign up for that in a second.  Of course.  Really?  That's the big joke?  Ha ha.  You're going to be in front of 6,000 people?  No, you're not. 
[00:50:00]  Idiots.  What a dumb joke.  His jokes are awful.  What a dumb joke.  It's horrible.  I know.  I would take that gig in a second.  But if he's just going to riff, oh, is he going to be in for a rude shot?  That's a live audience, man.  Oh, they're going to, they'll lead him alive.  Oh, yeah.  They'll lead him alive.  They're going to want something.  Because there's no, there's no, uh, what am I trying to say?  There's no dedication, I guess, is what I'm trying to say to Charlie Sheen.  So you can't just get up there and riff.  And he's not.  They're going to tear him apart.  And as long as he's being paid, that's all he gives a shit about. 
[00:50:30]  You think he cares if he's putting on a good show?  Right.  I think I'm saying loyalty, where a loyal audience will give you a little bit.  Yeah.  But they're not loyal to Charlie Sheen.  They don't know what he's going to do.  It's going to be unexpected.  They want him to go on stage and do coke.  That's why everyone is following this asshole.  That's what he should do, by the way.  I mean, Dice had the best rant about it.  Did he?  I know.  I heard about it, but I didn't see it.  We should play it again.  Going into break, it's worth playing again.  I didn't see it.  Dice had the best rant on it, basically saying exactly what's happening. 
[00:51:00]  Unfortunately, he was dressed like a pirate at the time.  I heard about his eyepatch.  Yeah.  But, yeah, people are following him because they want to see him partying again.  Can we find that, Dan?  We could go to break with that.  The Dice thing.  I think they put it back on YouTube.  He talks a little bit about Gilbert in the beginning, which is fine, and then he goes off on Charlie.  This thing has legs.  You want to go to break with this?  Yeah, sure.  I want to work with Charlie and do all those people.  Wouldn't that be great? 
[00:51:30]  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, that'd be all right.  That's why I hate me, though.  What a nasty joke that would be to play on you.  Oh, that just stunk.  God.  All right, we'll go to break with this.  Dice really just ripping into Sheehan.  It's very, very accurate from the Dice man.  And, yes, he looks like a pirate.  Yeah.  Because I guess he had an eye infection or something.  He called, but we couldn't get to him because stupid Ian and his dumb whores wouldn't shut the fuck up enough for us to just put the phone line down and say hi to Dice.  Oh, that's him.  We literally couldn't, you know, get to Dice, which was so frustrating. 
[00:52:00]  He was in the hole.  And he's probably going to do this rant that he ended up doing for the paper here.  Yep.  But we go to break with this.  Dice on Charlie Sheen and a little bit Gilbert and Gottfried in the beginning.  In your day, what do you think of what Gilbert Gottfried said that got him kicked off of Affleck?  What Gilbert Gottfried said?  I don't even know what he said.  What did he say?  Basically, he put out a Twitter tweet about this.  Another Twitter. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Another idiot with Twitter.  He put out a tweet.  You know, I don't even have a Twitter account.  You know what I got?  My wife does it for me.  Mrs. Dice Clay.  Anybody wants to Twitter me.  Okay?  Who gives a f*** about Gilbert?  You know?  You come to me with Eddie Murphy, well, then maybe I'll have a comment.  You know what I mean?  You know?  Maybe.  What did he say?  He said something about, wait.  I think something about, like he made fun of the Japan thing, the Tokyo thing? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, he made fun of the tsunami.  And he made fun of that?  Yeah.  Okay.  He said Japanese.  Forget about him.  Forget about him.  How about, well, this f*** that everybody's afraid to say anything to, this f*** Charlie Sheen,  with all his ranting and all the attention he's getting, maybe he should say something nice  and maybe some kind words to all those people out in Tokyo and to their families while he's  got the f*** spotlight on him. 
[00:53:30]  You know what gets me about something like that?  Nobody's got the balls to tell this guy how f*** up he is.  He's on TV terrorizing newscasters because they've seen him waving a f***ing machete in  the air.  But he's f***ing saying, I'm winning.  Let me tell you something, Charlie.  I used to be a big fan of what you do.  You did some great movies in the past.  And you get an opportunity to be on one of the greatest sitcoms of this f***ing decade.  And then you go on TV and promote f***ing drugs.  You call that f***ing winning when you get f***ing fired from a hit sitcom? 
[00:54:00]  You call that winning?  You call winning when there's f***ing custody battles, your kids are being taken from you,  and you're living with two f***ing porno actresses that I could watch on YouTube, jerk  my f***ing shut on the off button, and you think you're f***ing winning going from a  hit show to a f***ing cooking show tossing a f***ing salad?  Get the f***ing help you need.  Because I'm sick of watching the Charlie Egg Show.  F***ing face. 
[00:54:30]  Take a word of advice.  I'm not afraid to tell you.  You're f***ed up.  They do commercials about f***ing drugs all the time.  This is your brain on drugs, and then they put it in a frying pan and show the f***ing  eggs scrambling.  Now they got Charlie Sheen to look at.  You're so f***ed up.  You don't even see the billboards from that f***ing show you were doing.  The one you're being a f***ing anti-Semitic guy to, to your ex-boss, whatever his name  is, that you're doing anti-Semitic remarks. 
[00:55:00]  Nobody likes that.  You're not a rock star.  You're not a comic.  You're the biggest f***ing loser in the world as far as I'm concerned.  Okay?  Go get the help you f***ing need.  Nobody's on Twitter watching you going, hey, Charlie's great.  Charlie's winning.  And everybody's watching you fall, and everybody's afraid to say it to you.  Get f***ing help.  And Gilbert, I think you lost a job, didn't you?  Maybe you need some help, too.  And we played that for Eddie Money's birthday. 
[00:55:30]  62 years old today.  Wow.  Eddie Money, 62 today.  We played a little production piece, so I want to mention that it's his b-f-day.  It's a b-f-day.  It's a b-f-day.  Hey, this supermoon was a bust, huh?  Oh, that was the dumbest thing. 
[00:56:00]  What was supposed to happen?  I don't know.  It was supposed to just be a big looking moon.  Could you grab that cord?  Jimmy's poking a cord up.  Grab that for him.  Jimmy's wire.  I forgot about Jimmy's wire.  Jimmy's wire, yay.  The supermoon.  I was walking home from a party around 1 in the morning,  because we watched the UFC fights and all that down in Philly.  Yeah.  And I was walking back to another house,  and everyone's like, did you see the supermoon on the way home? 
[00:56:30]  I'm like, no.  Where the fuck was it?  I couldn't even see the damn thing.  I guess it was behind a house by the time I left or something.  How big was it?  Was it cool?  Because I did want to see it.  It was...  It just looked like a big moon.  And then people that were taking pictures of it didn't understand  it looks ridiculous without something to scale.  It looks like a regular moon?  They were just taking pictures, yeah.  You got to kind of have something...  Could you see the cape? 
[00:57:00]  No, I didn't see the cape.  No.  It was a supermoon.  I've never seen nothing.  The big M on it.  Supermoon.  Able to circle the earth again.  And again.  Someone did tweet a picture of the supermoon next to the Lincoln Memorial.  That was kind of cool.  Yeah.  That was definitely a cool one.  Did that look good?  Yeah, I thought so.  Because if you see it like that and shit...  It looks like a regular moon.  It looks good.  No, that kind of looks good.  People are just taking pictures of just the moon.  Isn't a harvest moon bigger than the supermoon?  Oh, I don't know. 
[00:57:30]  Supermoon.  I'll take the moon.  Just the regular moon.  Is that another one?  I don't even know.  Supermoon.  I'll take the moon.  Oh, okay.  Supermoon.  Supermoon.  I'll take the moon.  Thanks.  Were things supposed to happen with the supermoon?  Um, I don't know.  Everybody was talking the end of the world maybe, or at least some electronic problems,  tidal things.  Nothing happened.  No.  People are gravely, gravely disappointed when the world doesn't blow up.  Just the moon.  When it's supposed to. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  It didn't look any bigger to me than it usually looks.  Yeah.  No.  That's why I want to know what the fuck it was all about.  It looks stupid.  Yeah.  Big dopey moon.  The moon is dumb.  Did it look orangey?  The moon is dumb.  The moon's an idiot.  It really is.  It can't even rotate right.  It's just half of it's always dark.  Yeah.  The moon is a fool.  I'd just slap the moon.  Just give it a whack?  I would give the moon, if I landed on it, I would just slap it repeatedly.  Round faces in general are so slappable. 
[00:58:30]  They're completely slappable.  Why is that?  I don't know, but they really are.  Why is that?  Because they look like there's no bad place for your face to hit.  Your hand to hit.  Yeah.  There's no jutting chin.  It's just round and perfect.  It's circular.  It just gives a nice slap sound, probably, is why.  Not that clump thing when you hit something that's not flat.  Yeah.  A nice, a nice, a good fucking slap to the moon.  All right.  That's all we have on the super moon.  There we go.  We covered that.  Because I don't know what we're supposed to say. 
[00:59:00]  I know I wanted to check it out, and I couldn't find it in the sky.  The moon's a douchebag.  You have to admit, the moon is a douche.  It's just a jerk.  The moon's a jerk.  The moon really is a fucking jerk.  Just listens to whatever the earth says.  Pussy.  I guess there's some radiation in the spinach and water over there in Japan.  Ah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Oh, me spinach.  Yeah, it seeped into some groundwater, and the spinach.  Pichk.  And some other vegetables. 
[00:59:30]  But spinach is so healthy for you, doesn't it just cancel each other out to radiation?  You would think.  Right?  Yeah.  I bet you it's still better than eating a sundae or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Can you eat a little radiation?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they're saying it's low levels.  There it is.  That's the one I think.  It's a little higher.  Kind of cool.  Than it should be.  Mm-hmm.  But still low levels.  I was looking at some chart yesterday of how much radiation we absorb from certain things.  And on a daily basis, or depending on what you're doing, you're getting some higher doses than they're getting in Tokyo, unless you're right by the nuclear power plant. 
[01:00:00]  But if you're just on the outskirts, you're not getting any more than you get.  I was amazed by how much you get from just a trip from L.A. to New York.  Uh-oh.  You get in a plane?  Mm-hmm.  And you fly cross country?  You're getting some, like, a lot more radiation than you get from an x-ray?  Damn.  Why did they ever tell us this before? 
[01:00:30]  I don't know.  I would have worn my radiation suit.  Radiation suit?  I would have went to the dentist and asked if I could borrow one of those big, heavy lead things.  Yeah, you want one of those?  A big lead?  Why not?  If it's more than an x-ray?  Like the dentist gives you?  Well, fuck.  If they give you that for a dumb x-ray in the dentist's office, don't you think you should be flying with that?  Yeah.  On a plane, you get x-ray?  Yeah, you get radiation on a plane.  More than an x-ray, it's saying.  There's a certain amount of, a certain type of radiation that you get just lying next to somebody.  I'm not kidding you.  Wait, I'm sorry. 
[01:01:00]  And from a banana.  I just ate a banana.  The potassium from a banana has some type of radiation to it.  It's really odd, the different types of radiations and stuff.  And then they had all these, and it was all in green, all these little boxes.  And each box represented a certain amount of radiation and how much you absorb by doing certain activities.  And it got bigger and bigger, and the box was just huge for this one thing, and it still wasn't that dangerous.  So then they go to this blue box thing, and it says, okay, this one blue box equals everything in all the green boxes. 
[01:01:30]  In the one blue box.  Oh, boy.  But the one blue is like still even nothing.  Right.  But then the blue starts building up to big, big, big.  And then that biggest one was the red boxes, and then one red box was everything from the blue box, which contains the green box and all the blues.  So it's kind of an interesting little chart on radiation.  That's how I spend my weekends, looking at radiation charts.  Studying radiation charts. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, you have to.  And going through my go bag on the compound.  Which Charlie Sheen ripped off.  Which Charlie Sheen went and, because I figured a lot of people were wondering what the go bag is and what's in mine and everything.  So I was taking it out, and everybody was laughing at me, calling me a lunatic and paranoid.  Did you put some silly stuff in there just to make the show a little better?  Well, you know what?  The silly stuff is just what's really in there, because people just think it's very silly, and they don't understand, you know, you might need some of this stuff. 
[01:02:30]  But where are you going?  If the shit hits the fan, there's nowhere to go.  It all depends on what shit.  You stay in your compound.  You don't have a...  You've been building your compound for a moment like this.  Sometimes you can't stay in the house.  You've got to go.  It's overtaken or something.  Then why don't you get a boat that you could have, like, buried in the sand or something?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Grab Keith's boat.  Because you're never going to be able to get off Long Island with a car.  You're going to need a boat, and if you don't have a boat already, they're going to be sold out of boats when the time comes. 
[01:03:00]  So you need, like, a boat in the woods.  You know how it's all covered up?  Covered up?  And camouflaged?  Stashed?  Yes, and ready to go.  I don't know.  I'm just thinking you don't know what kind of disaster it is yet.  Or get a helicopter.  Well, I would crash immediately, because I have no clue how to fly a helicopter.  A one-man helicopter.  It's very hard to fly a helicopter, I hear.  Really?  Yeah, it seems like it would be.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  It all depends on what the disaster is.  You know, you could have a disaster where you can just walk right the fuck out, and no one's trying to kill you or anything. 
[01:03:30]  You know, it's just dangerous to be in a certain area.  You've got to get out of there.  Is it localized?  Is it very widespread?  Where is it?  You know, where are you going?  It's depending on how dangerous different places are.  So you can't pick a definite place.  You just need certain things to make it so you can survive for a certain amount of days.  Why don't you start building a bunker?  No, I don't like a bunker in the house.  That'd be cool.  Take out one of your walls down in the basement and just start burrowing. 
[01:04:00]  Just start digging.  And then make walls as you go.  Underneath, like...  How cool would that be?  It'll go underneath the whole neighborhood.  Why not?  You think people do that?  Just bump into their basements.  You think people actually do that?  I don't know.  That would be...  I don't doubt that people have, like, chiseled out a part of their foundation and just burrowed  under.  And then just start burrowing.  And reinforced it with concrete and steel.  Right.  And not told anybody, you know, because I bet you can't get a building permit for that.  Nicole's walking down the hall from the morning mashup.  She kind of ruined our show Friday. 
[01:04:30]  Our great show at Pendulum and Joe Rogan.  I don't think she ruined it.  She ruined it.  There was no way to ruin it that show.  She completely ruined our show with her...  She interrupted.  Her big announcement.  I heard the bitch got married.  Yo!  Oh, she's coming in really fast.  Oh, okay.  Where the hell is?  Why aren't you as excited as you were Friday when you were ruining our radio show?  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.  We thought...  This is what I thought.  That's why I'm bringing you in.  Is it a big rock?  Oh, it's horrendous. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Let me see the rock.  What does he do for a living?  He's a sales guy.  I told you.  Oh, sales is good.  What does he sell?  When you were jumping up and down outside our studio...  I was just holding my hand because I wanted to show you.  But I thought...  Girls do this.  I'm like, wow, she's really into Chuck Liddell, Joe Rogan, or Penn Jillette.  And she really wants to meet one of those guys.  Like, I'm engaged.  So that's why I called in here.  Because I'm like, she's losing her mind over one of these guys in the studio.  And then it turns out she wanted to announce that she was engaged.  And then your guy wasn't as excited, though. 
[01:05:30]  Oh.  He was still shaking.  Oh, was he?  He's never been on the radio before.  And he just did it in front of, like...  And he did the proposal?  How was it?  Was it a...  Yeah, there's audio.  You can hear how...  Oh, it's a decent proposal?  It was.  He sounds very nervous.  Nervous?  Yeah.  Did you know?  You can go to moremaster.com.  You had to know.  I had no idea.  They blindfolded.  Because we were pretending we were going to play a game.  We were taste-testing something.  Oh, how tempting.  I was waiting, actually.  I was waiting for ketchup to be put in my mouth.  Oh, ketchup.  Who's he?  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Wow, that's something.  You can play it.  Can we get the audio?  Yeah, go to moremaster.com.  It's literally, like, it'll say...  Yeah, but do we...  Is it a long 20-minute piece?  If you go, like, to, like, halfway through, it's like...  And then how long from there?  It's not long!  Give it to Sam.  Sam will cut it up.  I'll tell Sam to cut it up for you.  And then we'll give you a big plug.  When's the date?  Let's just...  Oh, okay.  You're not one of those, right, get, when you get the ring, make a date?  You're just happy that he finally popped a question?  Yes.  How long are you dating this guy? 
[01:06:30]  Two and a half years.  Oh, it's a long time.  Yeah.  Yeah, you kind of know each other.  Are you living in sin, are you?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  There's some time now.  That's good.  Yeah.  You don't want to do that living apart until the wedding night.  No!  And it's like, oh, those divorces happen in, like, a week.  It's like, oh, wow, really?  You do that?  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, we've already done it.  It's all, it's all, it's all over with.  Well, you've got to stick your wiener in first.  You do.  You have to.  You've got to know what that's like.  You've got to test drive your wiener.  You've got to test drive it and make sure that you're compatible. 
[01:07:00]  Make sure the girls are satisfied, the guys are satisfied, everything's good.  I was pretty happy with the test drives, though.  Good, good, good.  Oh, that's good.  Very good.  So, thank you.  Congratulations, I haven't seen you.  It's great.  I'm like, why is she losing her mind over Chuck Liddell?  I know.  Look at she's jumping around.  That thing sure glistens.  There's no mistake in that.  Did you give him a little extra over the weekend?  Because, you know.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  The ring will always do it.  Are you joking?  The ring will always do it.  You think she gave up the balloon nut?  I don't know.  That part?  You have the turd cutter?  Come on.  The turd cutter. 
[01:07:30]  Did he give up where the poo comes out?  Yeah, exactly.  Did the fudge factory get fucking plugged up?  Oh, God.  That's how you asked.  The turd cutter.  That is the most disgusting thing.  Why?  I heard Otto say that.  He's the guy that got that from turd cutter.  Yeah.  I don't know where he got it from or if he made it up, but it's very funny.  I think he stole it from Jay Moore.  Oh, probably.  Jay Moore's.  Jay Boaz.  All right.  What else is going on?  No supermoon.  That didn't matter.  No, that didn't matter. 
[01:08:00]  Operation Odyssey Dawn.  Yeah, that's a weird name for that fucking thing, huh?  Yeah, where did that come from?  That sounds like some kind of...  A Spinal Tap song?  I don't think...  Yeah.  That's good.  Operation Odyssey Dawn.  That's...  I don't know where that came from.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  It doesn't...  What does Odyssey mean?  Odyssey Dawn.  What does Odyssey really mean?  It's kind of an Odyssey.  Operation, we know.  A journey.  Probably the unknown.  Very vague.  Kind of an Odyssey.  It's an experience.  A life experience.  We get Operation and we get Dawn, because they did decide to do it kind of in the middle 
[01:08:30]  of the night, right?  As the sun was sort of coming up, right?  Is that it?  I would assume that's what Dawn is, at least.  It looked pretty dark when those cruise missiles were going.  And then the Odyssey part, I don't really understand that.  Maybe it's like the dawn of their Odyssey.  Their newest Odyssey of...  But Odyssey's a very vague word.  Life without Gaddafi and the Libyan people's Odyssey.  Where will it take them? 
[01:09:00]  And it's like the dawn of their new journey.  Yuck.  I'm just making this shit up, but it kind of makes sense even as I'm saying it.  Yeah.  We're getting lame with our operation names.  Our operation...  You don't like our operation names?  Yeah, we used to have some good ones.  This one confused a lot of people.  Operation Odyssey Dawn.  By the way, speaking of this real fast for you, I bet we didn't make it up.  I bet that was like a coalition-agreed thing.  Fuck.  I lost it.  Uh-oh. 
[01:09:30]  Michael Moore had a nice tweet.  Oh, yeah.  Talking about the cost of the Tomahawk missiles and how many teachers each missile could...  Right.  He's such an idiot.  I mean, I understand what he's trying to talk about, but you know, it's like you can't compare  one thing with another.  If we completely decimate the military, we could probably feed every starving person,  send everyone to school, and we'll be conquered in a fucking month.  We fired over 100 Tomahawk missiles into Libya this weekend at over $600,000 to $1 million 
[01:10:00]  a missile.  Each missile would pay for 12 to 20 teachers in the U.S.  So we should launch teachers, is he saying?  That's not effective.  That's silly.  I actually agree with him on that.  Not necessarily with the teachers, but because it's not our problem, and we're wasting so  much money in Iraq, it just annoys me that we're wasting money on Qaddafi.  Well, I agree with that, too, as far as getting involved.  I don't like the Libyan people. 
[01:10:30]  I could give a flying fuck if Qaddafi kills them all.  It doesn't matter to me.  But to compare the two is really silly.  I mean, they made them already.  You know how many jobs are made?  They made them already?  You know how many jobs are made because cruise missiles have to be built?  So it all comes out in the worst, as they say.  And what?  So more teachers can do nothing and teach people that don't want to be taught?  And that's why our education level is so far below a lot of other leaders in the world? 
[01:11:00]  You think we wanted to be taught when we were growing up?  Kick these fuckers out.  You don't...  What?  We didn't want to be taught growing up, either.  Yeah, but you know what?  Test scores were a little better.  They made it harder for us not to just fucking...  No.  Not to go to school.  Who wants to be taught when you're young?  No one wants to be taught.  No one, but there was a certain discipline and a certain just way of teaching that didn't include political correctness and revisionist history and fucking... 
[01:11:30]  You can't do certain things or else you lose your job.  I'm not talking about whacking a kid across the face with a fucking cock.  I'm just saying, we put ourselves in this position where the educational system here in this country blows  by just handcuffing everybody.  You can't even talk back badly to a student. 
[01:12:00]  You can't challenge a student's thoughts on politics or morality or anything.  Just make them think.  Because they go home, tell their parents, and their parents go,  they were saying things in school that were so upsetting and talking about homosexuals.  And it just becomes this big thing where no one wants to take chances.  No one wants to let people really expand their minds in school.  Fuck them.  I wish I was...  Fuck the teachers.  Fuck their unions.  Fuck everybody that's got their hands tied behind their back and won't say a word. 
[01:12:30]  Everyone's just such a pussy in this country now.  Real pussies.  I wish I was smarter because then I would homeschool my kids.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You know what I'm doing, like the Westboro Church?  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Brewer homeschools his kids.  Does he really?  Yes.  He doesn't do it, does he?  I think so.  I think he and his wife are homeschooling their kids.  But does he get, like, a teacher or something?  And I wish I was smarter because I think I would do that so he wouldn't have to deal 
[01:13:00]  with all that PC crap.  Brewer has homeschooling his kids.  I so wish I was smarter.  Can I get smarter between now and the time the kid turns, I don't know, eight, let's  say?  No, I think you're pretty set in your ways.  I think so, too.  Fuck.  I wouldn't do that.  There's an advantage to school, too.  There's a social advantage.  There really is a social advantage to doing what the other kids are doing.  Well, he used to be.  I don't know.  I don't even see that anymore.  I'll get him in sports.  Yeah?  You're going to throw him in some sports?  Yeah, it horrifies me because, I mean, my sister and my brother's kids are older, and 
[01:13:30]  I see what they go through.  I'm like, I don't know how I'm going to do this with my kid.  Yeah?  School systems have really drastically changed.  Send him private.  Private school?  Who's got the money for that?  You know that kid's going to private school.  Yeah, you have to.  You can afford it.  Private schools are better if you can afford them.  You know he's going to private school.  I never went to one, but if I had a kid and I could afford it, I would.  Yeah, you'd have to.  Come on.  Who knows?  Who knows what is right?  Come back.  Come back.  Does his ring make you plump his ballpark? 
[01:14:00]  What does that mean?  The ballpark Frank?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think that's it.  And I would give you a Twitter plug, but another person has the worst Twitter name, so it makes  it impossible to fucking plug your Twitter.  I don't know why people do that.  Why wouldn't you come up with the easiest one?  Yeah, you're just making it very difficult.  Ready?  J. Lee Hain 3.  Good luck finding that.  Have fun.  Have fun.  I'm not going to spell Twitter names. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Amanda in Ontario.  Who spelled Ontario O-N-T-E-R-E-O today?  Because that's just terrific.  Did he really spell Ontario O-N-T-E-R-E-O?  Why?  Who did?  Troy.  Troy's not the smartest guy.  Troy can't spell, Sam?  The spelling thing is very, very...  All right, Amanda.  What's up?  Troy.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hello.  I was listening to you guys talk about the radiation, and I live in a small region where 
[01:15:00]  they built two power plants extremely close to each other, and one of them had a small  leak in the water stream last week, and after this whole thing in Japan, people were just  losing it.  Going to doctor's offices, grabbing iodine pills.  Like, it was just insane.  Really?  Yeah.  It was actually hilarious to see the...  Hilarious to see people panicking that they might be irradiated.  Well, it was such a small, small leak, and then, you know, you hear this big Japan 
[01:15:30]  thing, so everybody just goes nuts.  Yeah.  Same thing's going to happen to them.  I hear you.  It's funny to see people go into panic over something so ridiculous.  Well, you can understand their fear, can't you?  Well, radiation is...  Well, for sure.  Radiation's a hot topic right now.  Yes.  Very hot topic.  And I'm sure if it had happened, like, three months ago before this whole Japan thing came  up, there wouldn't be as big of a stir, but then you hear, you know, Japan, radiation, 
[01:16:00]  how much destruction it's done, and people just hit all chaos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People get very scared of radiation because there's really...  You can't see it coming.  That's the worst thing.  It's like you're just kind of...  Do you feel it, though, when it hits you?  No.  You feel it afterwards.  How long afterwards?  It all depends on how much you got, what kind it is.  You can feel it within hours, you know.  You start feeling nauseous and puking and... 
[01:16:30]  What if you're close to Fukushima?  Fukushima-type radiation, I think...  Like, let's say you're...  No, let's give...  Let's say you're 10 miles away.  10 miles out?  So you get a nice sweep of radiation that hits you, right on the head.  When do you start...  Right on the head.  When do you start feeling it?  I don't think you're going to feel that for a while.  You might feel the ill effects from it in the form of, like, cancers, though, in a while.  But do you get nauseous or any of that?  No, I don't think being 10 miles from Fukushima right now would give you that immediate radiation 
[01:17:00]  poisoning kind of a thing.  Like, I think the workers there, they're probably vomiting and clumps of hair falling out and  shit like that.  Would your pee glow?  No, I don't think your urine starts any illumination in the toilet.  That would be at least cool.  Yeah, at least you'd be able to look and say, okay, I've been irradiated.  But at least this is kind of cool.  Yeah.  I think you'd start seeing, though, I think in the coming years you might see more birth defects  and some certain types of radiation-induced cancers. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Fluid.  Some fluids.  Fluids.  There's going to be, well, radiation will begin to.  Cells will develop in a cluster around the area.  You never want to hear you have a cluster.  A cluster.  Tumor will begin to.  It gets harder as you squeeze it, and you can't really do much about it.  But that's radiation.  You've got to drink milk, and you take the dye. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, and it shows.  It shows up there in your fluid, your urine.  Yeah, what you have to do, we have to get a biopsy, and I'm actually having this conversation  alone in my car.  I'm just talking to the steering wheel.  Hoping they call me.  Yeah.  Do you think he just drives around to his fast food joints and fucking hopes we call?  Here's what Steve does.  He has his hand over the answer button on his phone, and he just talks.  When we pick it up, he'll already be in a good stream. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, I was just thinking the fluid and the buildup and all the things.  You guys want to have fun with it, but, you know.  As he continues to clog his own arteries with his fast food meals.  Obama really is taking a tour of Brazil with his fucking family.  Oh, yeah.  That's why my joke about the fucking Christ thing.  Of course he is.  Because his kids are on spring break, and that's where they wanted to go.  Of course he is.  You've got to talk to a teacher, Ed.  You've now pissed off the teachers.  I know I did.  You're really...  I'm not making any friends.  Is your goal to piss off as many people as possible today? 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, that could be.  Let's say hi to Josh, the teacher in Baltimore.  Baldi-more.  Yeah.  Hey, first of all, Anthony, love you, but I teach you guys from Long Island,  so I teach you like a BOCES type school.  BOCES.  That used to mean retarded school, but I know it's not really.  It's not at all, but that's...  I mean, my kids don't talk.  They're in wheelchairs.  They're in diapers.  They're dependent on human care for the rest of their life, but...  So what the fuck are you teaching them?  Well, that's the thing. 
[01:19:30]  I should be teaching them how to be as independent as possible,  but the government has me do these cockamamie tests that I have to show  how they can understand physics, science, and everything,  and they judge me on that.  If they don't get that, instead of maybe learning to tell me  when they have to take a shit, you know, then I look bad.  Yeah, but that's just it.  See, the teachers' union is very gung-ho on getting more money, 
[01:20:00]  negotiating contracts and shit, but you know what?  There's got to be a point where maybe the teachers and the unions step in and go,  we have to do this.  We have to be able to talk and teach, not just about the cash.  It always seems like, you know, even with you guys, it just comes down to the cash,  and I can understand that, but then you get all upset when teachers are flying out the door  and getting fired because they were a little unorthodox with their teaching methods, 
[01:20:30]  or they didn't treat one youngster with respect that he was due culturally, perhaps.  That's bullshit.  God damn.  I also don't like tenure.  I think tenure just breeds laziness.  Am I wrong about that?  I can't see where you can't be fired.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah, yeah, that's another thing.  You can't be fired.  Stop.  Who's best?  That's in who's best interest, really?  Come on.  You can be fired.  Oh, what does tenure mean?  You go to the rubber room.  What a dope I am.  We all know about the rubber room, sir. 
[01:21:00]  You get paid.  You go to the rubber room.  You sit there and fucking collect pay, and it's very hard to fire a teacher unless he's fucking the children.  There's a teacher in my school two years ago who got fired.  I am.  What do you do during the summer?  What do I do during the summer?  It seems like the greatest job ever.  You get every summer off.  Oh, my God.  It's like being a kid.  That's wonderful.  I took the last two summers off, but I got a baby on the way, so I got to work this summer. 
[01:21:30]  What are you going to do?  What am I going to teach summer school?  Oh, yeah.  I want to know about the teachers that can't get the cool job in summer, so they're like doing some lame-ass temp job.  Like temp jobs.  Right.  That would suck.  All right, Josh.  You're a bore.  I'm moving on.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, do you want to hear Nicole getting engaged?  I do, actually.  You do?  Let's hear what that's all about.  All right.  So, Nicole from the Morning Mashup.  Very excited on Friday. 
[01:22:00]  Extremely.  This is how it went down on the Morning Mashup.  What channel is that?  One?  I don't know.  Channel one?  I think it's one.  Hits one, right?  That's got a rule being on channel one.  That stinks.  You ever see New York one?  It's terrible.  That's true.  You do kind of bypass that.  Oh, it's horrendous.  Every time you turn it on, it's some boring panel discussion.  One black guy in a way.  I don't know.  It sounds to me like partisan politics as usual.  Well, we have to learn to work through these things because the governor has said, shut 
[01:22:30]  the fuck up.  That is boring.  You're so right.  That's fucking boring.  Are you kidding?  You know how many people don't switch their cable company because of New York one?  New York one.  That's a reason to pay so much money for shit you don't need.  Do you know what?  I just realized that I have Fios now.  I haven't seen that fucking shit.  You have the Fios equivalent of that.  By the way, I was going on...  I don't want Fios.  Oh, it rules.  I love resetting my internet every day. 
[01:23:00]  Fios.  We're going to have to get up on a rickety chair way up high, risking fucking paralyzing  myself just to get my internet back on.  I love doing that every day.  My internet, right, O?  I love doing that every day.  My internet, I realize I have a slight problem because I download things so fast that my  hard drive can't actually write the data as it's coming in.  Isn't that great?  I think I have to get some new hard drives.  It's fucking great.  Are you liking it?  Yes.  I don't know how to use the remote control on the phone, but I did program the DVR on 
[01:23:30]  the phone.  Yeah.  So, of course, I'm going to record because we have Brock coming in.  I'm doing the Ultimate Fighter the entire season.  Oh, shit.  Right from the phone, you can fucking go on.  Isn't that great?  Delete shit from your DVR.  You can see how much space you have on your DVR left.  I don't want to do that.  It's fucking cable.  It stinks.  Isn't the guide very intuitive?  I like the guide.  It's just little boxes.  You move it over.  They're color-coded for sports and other shit.  The only thing I don't like, when you're on the guide, you can search. 
[01:24:00]  You have the whole guide up.  Say you want to go to channel 595.  Yeah.  You just punch in 595 and it tells you what's going to be on.  But on the HD, if you're looking only through HD, you can't do that kind of search.  Oh, okay.  Have you set up your favorites yet, though?  No.  Because you've got two banks of favorites.  Yeah, man.  So you just get the channels that you keep going to.  You put them in your favorites, and now you just go to favorites and scroll through those.  Bing, boom, boom, boom, favorite.  Boom, boom, dude, you're looking through your favorites.  You're hanging out.  Dude, you want this one?  Boom, you go to that channel.  HD, boom.  I'll tell you something I like about that remote app, too, because a lot of times I'll just forget 
[01:24:30]  where the remote is and I'll leave it across the room.  Yeah.  But I always have my phone handy.  You always got your phone.  So it's just like, oh, well, now I don't even have to get up to get the remote.  I'll just go on my phone and be like, boop, now I got a remote.  Define something on TV.  Phone is everything.  It's the best.  Your phone is everything.  Of course, I turned my iPhone into an N phone over the weekend.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Whoops.  Wait.  Whoopsie.  Oh, it's cracked pretty good.  What happened to that one? 
[01:25:00]  Well.  You're breaking a lot of phones.  It was either the phone or the glass of Shiraz in my hand.  I had to make a quick decision which one to drop.  Oh.  And I figured I could always go to Apple and get the new glass put on the top of the phone.  There you go.  But I was wearing very nice clothes, TV clothes, and I didn't want to drop my wine.  Can you get glass put on your phone or you've got to get a new one?  Oh, no.  I could go back in.  They'll just replace the glass top.  It's like nothing.  How long does it take?  It depends on who you know.  This will be very quick.  This is a guy that wants to explain tenure to you. 
[01:25:30]  Thank you.  And me.  I didn't know anything.  Ten-year-olds?  Tenure, Jim.  What do you got on tenure?  What's up, boys?  First of all, Ant, good choice of wine with the Shiraz.  I like that.  Ah, thank you, sir.  Second, tenure is kind of just like unions where it's one of those things where the concept  is kind of awesome, but they just fucking look like shit.  The idea of tenure, especially in academia, is that you're supposed to have a free exchange  of ideas.  So tenure allows teachers to have maybe conflicting ideas with the boss and they can't get fired 
[01:26:00]  over it.  So it's like one of those things where in concept it's kind of awesome, but you're right.  It just breeds laziness and assholes and, you know.  Yeah.  All those things were such great ideas until you realize, oh, God.  They fucked it up by, you know, just taking advantage of it and twisting it into something  else.  Sorry.  Yeah, basically, yeah.  Punching out, boys. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  The thing, what different ideas are older academia pushing?  Really?  You mean they're not pushing fucking completely liberal ideology forth?  Yeah.  I hate it.  I'm so bored of myself saying liberal, but it's the truth.  It is.  But they really do.  There's no other way to phrase it.  Right.  All right.  This is what we're going to do.  When we get back, we got the audio of Nicole from the morning mashup being, getting engaged  on her show.  Yeah.  We'll do that and some other things, okay?  Right, right.  Right, right. 
[01:27:00]  The virus.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  Where did Jimmy go?  He wanted to hear this audio of Nicole getting engaged from the morning mashup.  Yes.  I think he went to go take P.S.  Take a leak? 
[01:27:30]  I'm going to go take P.S.  You know, he's got that tiny little Jimmy bladder.  Mm-hmm.  That old Jimmy bladder.  But we have the audio of her getting engaged.  Yes.  And from what our young Sam says, the douchey thing is the bit they were doing leading up  to the engagement.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I guess that's how she wanted to be engaged, huh?  On the air?  Yeah.  You know, she's a radio girl. 
[01:28:00]  I think it's one step below getting engaged at a sporting event.  Oh, no.  That's the worst ever.  I'm sorry, man.  And I know there's plenty of people out there who's like, oh, I did that.  If you're on the big screen.  Well, no, why?  Because no one in the arena gives a shit past the first three seconds.  Yeah.  They're like, oh, wow.  Anyway, you want a fucking, another popcorn or something?  I told you that you're everything to me, me, me.  And I think...  Oh, no.  They don't even give you that.  No.  I know. 
[01:28:30]  They give you a little something right after the birthdays.  Yeah.  You know, and let's, you know, let's go to section three.  Section 228.  And there's the camera.  And then the guy's shaking like a motherfucker.  Because look, they don't know they're on.  They're looking at the monitors.  He probably has bad dry breath.  Sour breath.  And then he goes down on one knee and into some puke that's left over from a Ted Nugent  concert back in 1978.  Nice.  And then he fucking goes, will you marry me? 
[01:29:00]  She's like, what the fuck is wrong when you're doing it here?  But I guess.  Yes.  Yes.  And then they hug.  And then usually what you see is them both just staring at the ice.  They're not even talking to each other.  Ugh.  Dumb.  That is a dumb way to do it.  By the way, I hate women who wear sports jerseys.  Oh, you don't like that?  I hate it.  Why?  I like a girl with a nice...  Just awful.  It's kind of sexy.  Jeter jersey on.  It's not sexy.  It's sexy.  A chick in a hockey fucking outfit.  It's sexy because they at least made them look better. 
[01:29:30]  It's hideous.  They got all that stuff for women now.  They used to have to wear the guy's stuff.  Oh, I hate it.  I'd rather have my fucking...  I'd rather have my girlfriend just wear a shirt with black dicks on it than a fucking  hockey jersey.  Take pictures of it or literal black dicks laying on it?  No, like those little epaulets.  What do they call those things on the epaulets?  Oh, epaulets.  Epaulets.  On your fucking shoulder?  I bet hers are two dicks.  What city do the black dicks play for? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, the black dicks.  Oh, God.  Every city.  What do you got on this Nicole thing?  It's kind of hacky.  Let's be honest with each other.  We're happy for it.  I think it's appropriate for their type of program.  Yeah, it's nice, but I always figured if you're going to get engaged on the air, the  point is you have a tape and then you play it for your kids one day and all this.  But if my parents played me the tape, I'd be like, were you really working for a radio  show where a passable bit was getting blindfolded and then seeing if you could taste the difference 
[01:30:30]  between stuff that is brand name and off-brand and getting all excited about it?  Oh, is that what the bit was?  Yeah.  That sounds like a good one.  No, it doesn't.  Ryan had to drink.  Sorry, I meant shit.  Coca-Cola and store-brand cola.  Yeah.  He could tell the difference.  He could?  Yeah.  I bet I could tell the difference between fucking...  I could, too.  I bet you guys couldn't.  Coca-Cola or Royal Crown?  Yeah.  I could taste the difference between Diet Coke and fucking anything. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, of course.  Diet Coke sticks.  I love it.  Why would they do this?  Well, that way they could get Nicole blindfolded.  Nicole thought she was going to taste the difference between store-brand ketchup and Heinz  tomato ketchup.  Oh, right.  That's what she thought.  And then she ended up getting engaged.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  And then she jumped up and down and...  Screamed a bit.  And we all had a fake excitement for her.  Then they had to go back to the music.  Right back to the music.  You know, they can't just sit there and have a four-minute talk break. 
[01:31:30]  They're not even allowed to extend their talk for an engagement.  No, Tayo Cruz has to play.  Oh, that Lady Gaga song.  Can't wait any longer?  Are they playing Rebecca Black?  They played it...  What's the big deal about this song?  Oh, my God.  Well, it's hilarious.  Friday, Friday.  Then comes Monday, and then it's Tuesday, and fucking...  Oh, apparently...  She's not even that cute.  Some girl with, like, a rich father or something who paid to have her cut a single and create 
[01:32:00]  a professional music video.  But it's, I mean, it's the craziest thing you've ever seen in your life.  Did she do the Today Show?  What show did she do where they did an interview?  The reporter or the interviewer was sitting there and actually said,  Hey, so people have been really hating on this and just was repeating shit.  What's the meanest thing people have been saying to you?  And the girl goes, Well, someone said I should start cutting myself and...  And then they also said I should get an eating disorder because I'd look prettier. 
[01:32:30]  It's like, Oh, God.  And then the reporter starts reading some of the other shit that she's been getting.  Why don't we have that audio?  There's nothing to talk to her about.  I want to hear that.  Yeah, that is good.  Because there's nothing else to talk to her about.  The only thing that's noteworthy about the song is how shitty it is.  Friday, Friday.  Is it good?  No, it's so bad.  It's all auto-tuned up the ass. 
[01:33:00]  Well, it's good, eh?  And her friends come driving by and they're not her friends.  They all look like they're fucking 10 years old and can't drive.  And she's talking about how she's going to party, party, party, party.  And she's 13.  Well, the best part about the song is when she's trying to figure out whether she's going to sit  in the front seat.  Front seat or the back seat.  Or in the back seat of the car.  Where's she going to sit with her friends?  Here come her friends.  Now what?  She's at the bus stop.  What is this little bitch's name?  Rebecca Black.  Rebecca Black.  She's the new shit.  She's taking over the internet with this. 
[01:33:30]  Let's have that auto-tuned up.  I'm going to fuck you in my mouth.  Gotta go downstairs.  Gotta have my bowl.  Gotta have cereal.  Seeing everything.  The time is going.  Chicken on and on.  Everybody's rushing.  Gotta get down to the bus stop.  Gotta catch my bus.  I see my friends.  Kicking in the front seat. 
[01:34:00]  Sitting in the back seat.  Back seat.  I don't know.  Gotta make my mind up.  We'll see.  Can I take?  It's Friday, Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the weekend.  Weekend.  Why is this taking over the internet?  Because it's bad.  It's because it's bad.  And it's a spoiled white girl that decided, her parents decided to do this.  And it's so bad that everybody, it's become viral and everyone's hating on it. 
[01:34:30]  By making their own parodies of it.  Commenting on it.  Saying awful things to a 13 year old girl.  Which is catamount to cyber bullying.  Some people are saying.  So it's just become a big story.  Friday, Friday.  Yay!  This is how people feel on Friday.  It sure is, Sam.  Party.  Yeah.  Party and party and party.  Party and party and party.  Yeah.  Fun, fun, fun, fun. 
[01:35:00]  Fun.  We're driving on the highway.  We're driving so fast.  I want on the spot.  Fun, fun, fun.  Yeah.  Fun, fun.  Sounds like fun when you say it like a robot.  What happened?  Good stuff right there.  Good fucking stuff.  I'm digging it.  I just wish Julia had picked up like this song has.  Julia.  I remember.  Julia.  Julia.  Julia.  Oh, God.  That intern's horrid song.  That's what his name was?  Was that him?  Evan or something?  Noah. 
[01:35:30]  Noah.  Noah.  And he had the video made and everything.  Remember?  He had the bling and the fucking rolls.  His father.  His father.  Financed the video.  Maybe if it was a little more realistic when he was around girls and looking like he was  enjoying himself, maybe if he had played that up a little more realistically, it would  have gone over a little better, but I guess not.  Do people hate the Friday?  29 million views?  29 million views, Jimmy.  Because she stinks? 
[01:36:00]  Because she stinks.  Welcome to the fucking new millennium.  How embarrassing, though.  It was a trending topic for a full week.  Nobody can even keep a trending topic going for a day.  No, this is huge.  Last week, excuse me, number one trend in the United States right now, Rebecca Black.  Rebecca Black.  She beat out Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  Continues.  But is she getting killed, though?  Who she says she wants to do a duet with Justin Bieber.  So I so see that coming.  Because Bieber will jump on any fucking thing that keeps him in the news. 
[01:36:30]  But she's only 13.  I don't hate her as much as I would her father.  For encouraging this nonsense.  I think it's the mother more so than the father.  Whoever encourages this nonsense.  Yeah.  But she's 13.  What do you expect her to do?  She's got 29 million views.  Yeah.  She's famous.  She's now going to make money.  They're haters.  Doesn't matter.  29 million?  Yes.  28 million.  I will say everyone is a hater.  But now she's going to make some kish.  Hold on.  Can we hear Julia?  This is the predecessor.  It's up to 17,000 views. 
[01:37:00]  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  31 likes, 129 dislikes.  Strolling down 3rd Avenue.  Ah, ha, ha.  P-P-Putting on the wrists.  This is good.  This is so bad.  I forgot how bad this was.  Oh, let's hear the wall. 
[01:37:30]  He's holding a cane.  Poor guy.  He got in this right before, like, auto-tuning.  Yeah.  You're telling me Rebecca Black and Noah Roth's music didn't get together for...  Oh, I know.  But this video had to cost like a million dollars.  I know.  Look at it.  It's a big budget.  Really nice video. 
[01:38:00]  The look of it, anyway.  Who told him this was good?  His dad.  Oh, yeah.  Right here.  Do you think his dad was so thrilled he was singing about a girl?  He's like, yes, I'll make the video.  His original lyrics.  J-j-j-j-Jonathan, you are so beautiful.  Julio.  This is our old intern.  The biggest problem with this video is that every woman is about six inches taller than... 
[01:38:30]  Oh, of course.  He was a shrimp.  Listen to that.  Why would he do that to himself?  He's breakdancing.  He's at every shot.  You can't see his head.  No, because it's obviously not him.  He's alone in a room.  It's called Julia, the music video sensation by Noah Roth.  And, wow.  Oh, he's sweating up.  The production value, the cinematography, the color, everything looks amazing.  Absolutely.  With a shit song. 
[01:39:00]  He's a good dancer, though, with his white gloves.  That's probably because he has to touch a girl.  Got hot girls in the video.  They're all grabbing him and trying to pull him in the limo.  They're doing anything to stop him from singing.  I thought you were playing sound clips over this.  That's actually...  That's her.  Do they all watch this video and, like, applaud?  Yeah!  Julia!  Julia! 
[01:39:30]  There's Julia, and he's the limo driver.  It was a dream the whole time.  It was a dream.  He's just the chauffeur.  He's the chauffeur.  And now, look, he looks over.  And what horrific...  Oh!  Wait a minute!  Where are we headed?  Where are we going?  He's going to go rape Julia.  Well, actually not.  What horrific thing did we do to that intern?  Whoa.  Which one was he?  I think we got something on his shoes.  Oh, he was that guy.  Oh, yeah.  He would come in dressed to impress every day, remember?  I didn't bring that up. 
[01:40:00]  I swear.  I didn't remember what we did.  Yeah, that was him.  That was me.  Okay.  He used to wear clothes.  Iraq?  Yeah.  He'd wear these outlandish clothes that you guys would total up what the value of his entire  outfit was.  Yeah.  And he was wearing these suede...  The kid was rich, man.  Suede Gucci boots that was just annoying Opie throughout the whole show.  He'd look like he was wearing...  He'd try to look like he was just...  Ah, just threw this on.  Ah, just threw this together.  Just threw it together.  Meanwhile, I was wearing thousands of dollars of all name brand shit. 
[01:40:30]  His shoes were a couple thousand dollars easy, right?  Yeah.  Is that what we figured out at the time?  Yeah.  I'm thinking something cherry-ish or fruity.  It was a chocolate-covered strawberry.  A chocolate-covered strawberry.  That was given to us by a sponsor.  Yes.  Landed.  It was a direct hit on his fucking thousands of dollars worth of boots.  And that was the last day that we saw him.  Was it really?  That was it.  See, that's when we were allowed to beat the shit out of our interns.  Then he went to Julia. 
[01:41:00]  Uncontrollable.  You're uncontrollable?  Oh!  That whole thing.  That, there's no depth to that, like, that, ah!  It was so bad.  No power to it.  No nothing.  Yeah, but there was something like, you're still singing it, aren't you?  J-j-j-julia!  It was kind of catchy.  You're uncontrollable.  I gotta pass this one off to the morning mashup.  Ah, you should?  This, you got this, my friend is by my right. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, I got this, you got this.  Now you know it.  Chicken in the front seat.  Chicken in the back seat.  Oh, my lip is rolling.  Gotta make my mind up.  Oh, you gotta make it down so it's going over the days of the week.  It's Friday, Friday.  Friday, day.  I'm down on Friday.  Take it down.  Everybody's looking for a word to the weekend.  Friday.  It's Friday, Friday.  I hope you fucking die, day.  Aw.  Aw, wow.  I'm kidding, of course. 
[01:42:00]  She's a nice enough girl.  Out of the 30 million views, how many...  Someone's saying 88% negative feedback?  Oh, yeah.  So what's the like to dislike ratio?  Oh, it's huge.  I gotta know.  I gotta know.  Rebecca Black.  You're looking at...  Oh, okay.  I mean, she's popular.  She's got 9,944 likes.  Wait, wait.  9,000?  9,944 likes.  That's not bad out of 30 million.  Well, it's compared to 73,931 dislikes.  She's just a little girl.  She's a kid. 
[01:42:30]  The internet is vicious.  Isn't she 13, someone said?  Yeah.  Yeah.  13.  Holy shit.  Somebody called the song a mindfuck.  That's pretty good.  It could be.  Oh, fuck you, Rebecca.  Suck some horses dick.  With one comment.  She's just a little girl.  She don't care.  Once you put shit on the internet, it's over.  That's true.  I'll make a music video.  One person, Mr. Buckers, says someone spray a load of cum on her face.  That dirty little bitch needs to be put back in her place. 
[01:43:00]  That would do it.  Yeah.  Sexually abuse the child because she did a song you didn't like.  Right.  Well, what's great is she was having fun making a song.  When she put this video out and the song and she recorded it, like, this is her dream.  Right.  Like, this is a person.  This is my dream.  This was the culmination of everything.  Can you imagine, like, having a dream and finding out that it's just, you have no skill  at that at all.  It'll never work.  Yes, I can imagine that.  Why did she get 30 million views?  Because she's so.  There's things that are so hateable on the internet that don't get 30 million views. 
[01:43:30]  It just clicked.  Yeah.  Like, it's so weird.  It just all came together, huh?  It's like a lotto with the YouTube.  Even a little.  Wow.  Can we have Club Soda County remake this song?  Yeah, definitely.  One person writes.  Damn, I'd rather eat my shit.  Why do people watch this piece of crap anyway?  Fuck you.  You can't write that.  That was a real review.  Simple two-word review. 
[01:44:00]  Shit sandwich.  Yeah.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  Looking forward to the weekend.  Thursday was Thursday.  Thursday.  Today is Friday.  This is my shoehorn, eh?  We, we, we, so excited.  We, we, we, so excited.  We, so excited.  Oh, we got Tosh to blame on this one?  Yes. 
[01:44:30]  People are saying?  Okay.  Well, he was one of the first, yeah.  But Tosh obviously played it to mock it.  Yeah, I mean.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  No, he's a fan.  Friday, Friday.  Lyrics are totally fucked.  Who sent that one in?  That was from Tanzalince.  Oh, I thought it was something like buttfucker 0-3-3-5-9.  Uh, dear baby Jesus, why sincerely yours, bleeding ears?  Uh, didn't like it.  Another one didn't like it.  Someone put the poor bitch down. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, wow.  Advocating her being put down.  Um, one person just writes, what happened, you guys?  She has talent.  Smiley face.  I love this song.  Smiley face.  I think a little sarcasm.  Just under that, my ears just threw up.  And the video production, again, is terrific.  Yeah, really.  I like him for that.  I like him for that.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:30]  In the backseat.  Driving, cruising.  Class of the lane.  Switching lanes.  With a car to my side.  Come on.  It's a school bus in front of me.  Mixed tic-tac, tic-tac on the street.  My time is Friday.  It's a weekend.  We gonna have fun.  Come on, come on, y'all.  She's 13.  What's she doing on the weekend?  She's partying.  What kind of partying is going on on Friday?  Friday.  On Friday.  She's 13.  She's sucking dick on Friday.  Yeah.  Well, probably.  When are we gonna get the Club Soda Candy version? 
[01:46:00]  Friday.  Friday.  This week.  All right.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  I can't have any fun.  We gotta get that made immediately.  She's...  Oh, a big chant.  Fun, fun, fun.  Looking forward to the weekend.  Friday.  Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday. 
[01:46:30]  What else are you gonna do this Friday?  I don't know what that means.  What?  Yeah.  Go down?  Oh, yeah.  Sex.  Oh, yeah.  Sex.  And one of our friends in the car has like a Lemmy from Motorhead thing going on on her face.  It's party in here.  Party in here.  Party in here.  Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.  Going forward to the weekend.  Stop talking and start sucking.  I would rather a flatulent water hog than listen to this song again.  End of story.  I would like to call some of those people out on what they'd rather do. 
[01:47:00]  Show up at their house with a plate of shit.  Go ahead.  You said you would eat shit.  Friday.  Friday.  Fun, fun, fun, fun.  Really?  It's just, but I mean, that's something we could put into rotation for the Friday show.  That is true.  Can we do that?  That is true, please.  I don't disagree.  We definitely need that.  And we need Kenny's version immediately.  Yeah.  Immediately.  I don't know where we're going to find an instrumental.  Immediately.  I hear there.  Sarah from Buffalo.  Thank you.  See, there's a Twitter name I can promote because it's easy. 
[01:47:30]  She sent us the unplugged version of that, which supposedly is even worse.  Oh, why?  There's now an unplugged version on YouTube.  With her?  I heard there's a ton of covers of this show.  Yeah, there's covers.  Not covers, though.  This is Rebecca Black doing it.  I've never heard of that.  I've never heard of it either.  Well, because Justin Bieber did the acoustic thing.  So she's trying to get discovered.  I never heard of that.  Yeah, but Justin Bieber got known as like, wow, this little kid is actually really good.  Like, it doesn't work when it's like, wow, this little kid is like horrible. 
[01:48:00]  Horrid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She probably thinks she's really, she really thinks who the fuck she is.  Yeah.  She thinks she's talented.  You think Usher's going to jump on board and definitely take her under his wing?  She did it on ABC News.  Oh, okay.  ABC News is just putting this on to make fun of her.  She horned in cereal.  We're asking her to put in a bowl. 
[01:48:30]  Slide down the computer.  Where's the speaker on the iPad?  Yeah, I know, right?  It's horrendous, the speaker on the iPad.  Where is it, though?  What part is it on?  It's on the bottom.  Like, where?  Here?  Oh.  Here?  You'll never get good volume out of it.  Where the plug is.  Over here?  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  It's Friday, Friday.  Gotta get down on Friday.  Everybody's looking forward to the world again. 
[01:49:00]  We don't have to find it.  That's enough.  Wow.  Thank you, Sarah from Buffalo.  I appreciate it.  All you do.  Well, that's it.  You know, maybe she could sell out Radio City for two fucking shows.  I'm making money off this, as much as...  Friday, Friday.  But then she's going to fade into obscurity and just go into it, because she's going to  have this much fame, and then it's all going to go away, and it's going to be so horribly  depressing for a 13-year-old.  Out on the scene, showing some snatch, getting out of limos, things like that. 
[01:49:30]  Yep, absolutely.  People are suggesting the bleep game with the unplugged version.  I don't know.  Maybe there's something there.  Who knows?  I don't know.  I don't know either.  Rebecca Black takes it in the ass.  I don't know if that's true or not.  She's a technical virgin.  Remember the technical virgin.  Have we played the technical virgin shit in a while?  Maybe we play one of those to break to that.  Technical versions.  Nice, Billy.  Virgin.  What the fuck just fell out of my head?  Uh-oh.  What was that?  Do I need this to live?  Is that a chip?  What's that?  I didn't find anybody...  I jump onto the head, so I don't fall out of them. 
[01:50:00]  Ah, you told them.  A chip fell out of my head.  What's that?  You've been...  Have I been programmed?  Alien.  Aliens.  Fuck.  Took you.  What is it, though?  I don't know.  It just fell out of my head.  What the fuck?  Some weird shit's going on.  I saw Battle Los Angeles last night.  Yeah.  Oh, you actually went to a movie theater?  He didn't see that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the theater I was at, something was fucked up, though, because the sound was just a little  off from the movie.  Somebody have to go in the next room and fix it or something? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I went through it.  Does somebody have to download a better version of it?  Oh, that's illegal.  Never do that.  Highly illegal.  The theater I was at was...  And that was nice.  It was pretty...  Was it crowded?  No, it was pretty empty.  Sunday night, I guess.  As a matter of fact, yeah.  Which leads me to believe maybe the movie isn't that good, because it was just me and  Melissa were in there.  That was it.  That's the whole theater?  That was it.  In the entire theater.  Sticky floors?  Weird.  No, no.  The floors were remarkably clean and carpeted.  Wow. 
[01:51:00]  That's amazing.  Expensive snacks, though, right?  Great.  Chairs reclined and everything.  What?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's a great theater.  They serve alcohol, which is good.  Must cost you an arm and a leg, though.  I mean, the theater prices...  Not to tell you the truth, the price is very reasonable.  Really?  Very reasonable.  But the movie itself...  Bad, right?  What is it ripping off?  Independence Day?  There's a lot of Independence Day things going on, but not as bad as Independence Day.  No, Independence Day, at the time, was a really good movie. 
[01:51:30]  We like to look back and beat the shit out of it, but most of us went and enjoyed that  movie.  This is more a military look at it.  Like, a lot of the scenes with the soldiers seemed like they might as well have just been  running around in Iraq.  Like, it was kind of that gritty, kind of soldiery, Black Hawk Down look to it going  on.  You didn't really get a good, good look at the alien things.  Well, that's important.  You know, they keep it really shaky.  That's kind of like Jaws.  You don't really want to see the show. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, but at the end, you kind of want to see something.  Well, that's what they did in Jaws.  And then you saw the big ship at the end, and again, it was like one of these, oh, there's  the big thing, and you've got to destroy the big thing, and then the little things  can't do what they've got to do because the big thing is destroyed.  What did the aliens look like?  Terminator.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they look like Terminator guys.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  Kind of mechanical-ish.  But they were biomechanical, you know, because they were kind of living, so you could kill  them and shit like that.  Right.  The ships were kind of cool.  Just like Short Circuit. 
[01:52:30]  Cool.  No, they had like living things.  Johnny Five is alive.  Johnny Five didn't have guts.  He was alive, though.  You didn't have guts, though.  That's true.  Like, these things have, like, organs that you could fucking shoot and blood and stuff.  Did you like it?  I don't think I liked it.  Really?  I was like, I was just kind of like, eh, eh.  I found myself during it thinking, I hope this isn't much longer.  It's not a good sign.  Yeah, that's not right.  When you're like, eh, it's not a good sign. 
[01:53:00]  Why didn't you just turn it off?  Why can't you just turn shit off?  Turn it off?  It's a theater.  What am I going to go to the movie guy and say, could you stop?  Meaning, meaning get up and leave.  Rolling.  Oh, walk out?  Yeah, it's like, uh.  Probably didn't want to have to go all the way back to your house.  It's cold outside.  It's cold out.  What if I walked out?  Where was I going to go if I walked out?  You've got to go home.  You don't want to go home.  I would have to go home.  Then I watched another movie called Buried.  Oh, I want to see.  At the theater?  Yeah.  Double feature?  It was a double feature.  Buried. 
[01:53:30]  Is that about your yogurt?  What's Buried about?  Buried is a guy.  Van Wilder, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's Van Wilder.  Van Wilder.  What is his name?  I forget.  And he just wakes up, and he's buried alive in this wood coffin box thing with a Zippo  lighter, a cell phone with, like, Arabic fucking writing when he goes through the thing.  Oh, wow.  And he's got to figure some shit out?  And he's got to figure out why the fuck he's in there, who put him in there, how he's 
[01:54:00]  going to get out.  Last he remembered, he was driving, you know, trucks in Iraq, and his convoy got invaded.  It wasn't a soldier, just a truck driver.  His convoy got invaded, he got rocked to the head and got knocked out, and then he wakes  up, and he's in this fucking box.  Why would they give him?  And the whole movie is in this box.  My hand's raised.  Why would they give him a Zippo lighter?  That would take me out of the movie.  Because the real guys doing something like that wouldn't give you a Zippo lighter.  They gave him a Zippo lighter, but they also gave him a cell phone. 
[01:54:30]  And why would they do that?  Maybe that's the twist.  Yeah, yeah.  There's something to it.  There is a twist.  There's something to it.  Oh, really?  With Arabic fucking writing?  Yeah.  Stupid.  Yeah.  I'm not watching that.  It was good, and then when it ends, though, the credits roll, and you go, wait, what?  It's one of those movies.  I'll watch it.  Wait, what?  Yeah, watch it.  It's short.  It's not a long movie.  Was it stupid?  No, it was kind of like, whoa, that's fucking, like it was creepy, claustrophobic and shit.  I think the journey, a little better than the destination, but, you know, it was there. 
[01:55:00]  Kind of cool.  Was it better than that scene in Kill Bill, or was it, you might as well just watch the scene  Well, I was thinking he should try to punch himself out.  Yeah.  Like that, but.  So how did he get out?  I'm not saying a word.  Did he get out?  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fixing this.  Yeah, I'm going to see that.  I'm not ruining this for anybody.  I want to see that mug.  He finds a bomb.  Ah.  And then the Zippo lighter.  Zippo lighter.  Old school bomb.  Bomb.  Never happens in this movie.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Just checking out.  I want to see that son of a gun. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Is that, is it better than Battle?  Um, yeah, because it was shorter.  It was shorter.  Oh, you watched two duds over the weekend.  I don't know what, uh, what theater, um, you're going to be able to get that at.  Especially a double feature like that.  Um, I know I was lucky to find a double feature in, in, uh, the theater I go to.  Can I go to, uh, this guy wants to do his review of Paul, which is, which is getting good reviews.  I don't like that movie.  You don't like Paul.  It's a bunch of lies. 
[01:56:00]  No, Uncle Paul, it's about an alien.  Yes, I've seen what they were showing the jury.  No, it wasn't a movie.  We were making an action movie.  She fell down and I was picking her up.  Oh.  And her underpants fell off.  How did they fall off?  They, I don't know.  She started slipping.  And her underwear fell off.  So I had a cuppet with my mouth.  Oh, God.  That's probably not the way to go about it.  Vroom, vroom, vroom.  Paul getting, uh, Paul getting good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. 
[01:56:30]  Is it?  Alien movie, right?  That got me in big trouble.  Seth Rogen is the voice of Paul the Alien?  Yeah.  Okay.  Which is taking people out of the movie, see?  Chris on Long Island.  Hello, ladies.  Hello.  That was a great action.  It was a very good movie.  I mean, it's different from, um, the last two Peg and Frost movies, you know, with the zombies  and whatnot.  You saw Buried?  No, I did not see Buried.  Oh.  Paul.  Huh?  I saw.  Uncle Paul was doing scale-proving. 
[01:57:00]  Paul.  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  57 years young.  Go ahead, sir.  Sorry.  I'm interrupting.  All right.  Anyway, great movie.  Anthony, I think you will love it.  There's a lot of, um, uh, sci-fi references throughout the whole movie.  Oh!  I do like that.  And I would have to say that Mr. Spielberg gave them free license to, uh, make, uh, plenty  of jokes and references to almost all of his movies.  What a guy. 
[01:57:30]  Terrific of him.  Doesn't it?  Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, for allowing that.  Did he make fun of the fact that he took the guns out of the hands?  Yeah.  And he, too.  Kristen, Kristen, Kristen Wiig stole the movie.  She was great.  Who?  Kristen Wiig from Saturday Night Live.  Oh, yeah.  She's funny, man.  Jim and I got to conduct, uh, exclusive press interviews promoting this film at Comic-Con.  That's the one.  Didn't we?  Uh, Sigourney Weaver and Jeffrey Tamber were at when we were at the table.  Yeah.  Oh, that's this movie?  That was the table interview?  With Simon Pegg and, uh, oh.  When everybody had their recorders on the table and we realized it was for- 
[01:58:00]  The recorders on the tables for internet blogs.  Sigourney Weaver and Tamber were very nice, though.  Oh, yes.  Very nice.  Sigourney.  Um, I got another-  Something good did come from that weekend.  Friday.  What?  Well, speaking of Friday-Friday, I got another tweet on that.  Yeah?  But now I lost it.  Something very, um, exciting and interesting about Friday-Friday.  It was a terrific tweet.  And I can't find it.  Something about R. Kelly.  Oh, boy. 
[01:58:30]  Now we understand.  Oh, this guy said, and I want to give him credit, but I can't find his tweet at this point.  He said, now I understand why R. Kelly pees on children.  Yes.  Fucking shut her up with a nice yellow stream.  What a girl live her dream.  Where the fuck is it?  Boy, that dream just went to shit, didn't it?  Oh, yeah.  She's probably going to show her friends and think, this is going to be great.  You know, I might actually get a buzz on YouTube.  Shut up.  If I had, like, a party with all her people.  Party.  A party, party, fun, fun, fun, fun.  Friday, party, party, Friday, Friday, party, party, party, party, fun, fun, fun. 
[01:59:00]  When there was, like, 200 hits on YouTube, she's like, oh, wow, it's taking off.  And then it got totally out of control.  Then it's just like, she's realizing, wait, people are hating on me.  Oh, no.  And then the friends are like, you're going to get the haters.  It's okay.  And then she notices that 99% are haters.  Of 30 million.  Of 30 million people have seen her and hate her.  Yeah, they all think she's full of turkey.  Yes.  Could you, suppose there's an engagement at a sporting event where the woman just says, hello. 
[01:59:30]  That guy couldn't wait around.  If you can find that.  Are we going to play the Nicole getting engaged?  Yeah, I want to hear this.  I want to hear this abomination.  So it was a hacky bit they were doing?  I wouldn't say hacky.  And then it turns into her getting engaged?  Oh, man.  It was very sweet.  This is going to be very uncomfortable.  Very sweet.  Very uncomfortable.  How did you pop the question back in the day?  Oh, my God.  With the ring that I got from Penn Station?  The jewelry store that was in Penn Station? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just kind of walk.  I had to drive up to Boston.  I got in.  I walked in.  The whole family was there.  I demanded before I do anything that I have two giant tumblers of Captain Morgan and Coke,  which I downed in record time.  So I was nice and drunk, which is the way I would then spend the rest of my marriage.  And I just, I said, hey, will you marry me? 
[02:00:30]  And she said, yes.  And then, and then, uh, and then her mom was like, oh, my God, I can't believe you're getting married.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Judy was like, uh, you know, wow.  Oh, look at the ring.  It's so sparkly, she said.  And I'm like, really?  It's probably glass from fucking the Penn State.  Where did you get it?  What jewelry store did you get this at?  Please tell me how much the ring was again. 
[02:01:00]  Not even $800.  It was $700 and change.  Did you get it appraised?  I don't think I got it appraised.  Did you get insurance on it?  I don't think I got insurance on that ring, to tell you the truth.  It was, uh, I knew, I knew that, like, she wanted to get engaged.  I didn't.  But I knew she wanted to.  And if I went up there without a ring, it would have been trouble.  Because the engagement isn't marriage.  So I thought something would probably happen that I wouldn't have to get married.  But then she planned the wedding, like, three months after the engagement. 
[02:01:30]  I'm like, what happened?  I thought this was, like, a year, two years.  And by that time, this whole thing would have fallen apart.  But, um...  You're just trying to not make her mad.  You got swept away.  Yeah.  You got swept away in the marriage tsunami, man.  I did.  I didn't want to, like, cause a hassle.  Oh, bro.  I don't want a hassle.  What a hassle I ended up getting.  Oh, boy.  Don't you wish you'd just gotten yelled at at her house or whatever?  I know.  You know, I thought you were going to get an engagement ring for me.  Shout out, blah, blah, Friday, Friday. 
[02:02:00]  What was that?  Marriage proposal rejected.  Oh.  At a basketball game.  Going out of midcourt right now, Jerry.  I really can't imagine doing that.  You know, that's under pressure, isn't it?  Well, whatever you did worked, cause you're still married.  How many years?  40 years?  Alright, you know what?  I'm bailing.  Yeah.  It's fake.  Yeah.  Stop sending me fake shit.  It's so obvious.  Look, she's at center court. 
[02:02:30]  And she's putting her hands up to her mouth in that, oh my god, I can't believe you're doing that.  Yeah, yeah.  But she's a horrible actress.  That came...  They announced...  This is so fake.  I don't even need to watch the rest of this.  It was a publicity stunt.  The team put it on.  Okay.  Block the guy that sent it to you for fakeness.  Yeah, block.  That's what I do.  Block fakeness.  Prof mark, you're done.  I gotta block you.  Blocked for fakeness.  I don't have time for fake shit.  No.  Because I don't want anybody following me that is dumb enough to think that something's  real.  And that's an old fake one, too.  Everybody should know that. 
[02:03:00]  That was an obvious fake one, man.  You're gone.  Alright, here's Nicole getting engaged, I guess.  Let's just get this out of the fucking way.  Dan is doing...  And what day did this happen on?  I'm Stan's spoon backwards.  Friday.  What day was this?  I don't know.  I'm trying to think of what day it was.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I don't know.  I...  It was the day after Thursday, but before Saturday.  Remember, I was kicking in the front seat that day.  Were you kicking in the front seat?  Oh, maybe it was the back seat.  I don't even know.  I don't know.  I gotta decide which seat am I gonna take.  There's my friends.  When was Rogan in? 
[02:03:30]  I don't remember.  I had to grab my bowl.  Oh, it's cereal.  Friday, Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woo!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What an angelic voice.  Yeah.  It should be their wedding.  Nah, we don't have to do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dan is doing...  I had the damn spoon backwards.  Stan swears he's Tony the Tiger and can tell the difference between Frosted Flakes and Flaked Corn Flakes.  Okay.  What's wrong? 
[02:04:00]  They're doing a bit.  You don't think that's funny?  It's alright so far.  He called him Tony the Tiger.  Alright, you got the first one?  The first one.  Okay.  Stan, ready?  Wait, how do I do mine?  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Relax.  Okay.  I think Stanley T's worth saving.  What do you mean saving?  Get him out of that dust.  Get him out of there.  Have him extraction.  Go to the extraction point.  Yes.  We'll come and get you.  You're willing to leave the rest behind?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ready?  Wait, how do I do mine? 
[02:04:30]  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Relax, Nicole.  You're not up here.  This is the first one I tried.  Okay.  Yeah, Stan really felt the heat.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm going to tell you.  Hold on.  Okay.  Which one is the generic, Stan?  The one in your hand right now, is that the Frosted Flakes?  I want you to get this wrong so bad.  The one in my hand now is the Frosted Flakes.  Stanley T, you got it right!  Woo-hoo!  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.  Stan.  The logs in the house.  Now, Nicole, you got the ketchup pack. 
[02:05:00]  Friday, Friday.  Kellogg's in the house.  Is Kellogg's in the house?  Really?  Was it?  Wait, someone has to do this for me.  Open it up for her.  Stan, go over there on the other side of her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Keep your blindfold on.  I don't want you to see in the packets or anything.  Go on the other side of the call.  Yeah.  And do what I, put it, put it a little ketchup.  In my mouth.  In her mouth.  Put some ketchup in my mouth.  All right.  Okay.  Now, hold on, Nicole.  Okay.  This is number one.  Packet number one.  A lot.  I won't do a lot. 
[02:05:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Coley, don't eat that.  Who's that?  Bomb?  It's Bomb.  Bomb?  Take your blindfold off.  Hi, honey.  Hi.  How are you?  How are you doing here?  That's a good question.  Um, the other night when we were sitting on the couch, you were-  I can't listen to this.  Are you going to cry?  Come on.  Are you going to cry?  We might.  Come on.  What's the guy's name, Bomb?  Well, that's their nickname. 
[02:06:00]  His name's Matt, but they call each other Bomb.  Why do they call each other Bomb?  That's their little pet name.  Hey, Bomb.  Hey, Bomb.  I heard it.  What are you doing?  What are you doing here?  Yeah.  Hoping.  Let's, oh, God.  Let me hear the-  I got-  Let me hear that.  I got chills.  Take your blindfold off.  Hi, honey.  Hi.  How are you?  That's a good question.  Um, the other night when we were sitting on the couch, you were talking about how you  can't stand your name, your last name, and how you'd love it to be Ryan.  And, you know, I was sitting there thinking, oh, my God, I'm the luckiest guy in the world. 
[02:06:30]  Pause this for a second.  Not only is no beautiful girl.  And I'm sorry to tell you that I've been cheating on you.  Yeah, that's a show.  Oh, shit.  Your name will never be Ryan.  Oh.  Because I'm seeing someone else.  That would be the greatest clip ever.  Oh, God.  Would that make great radio.  Last name, and how you'd love it to be Ryan.  And, you know, I was sitting there thinking, oh, my God, I'm the luckiest guy in the world.  Not only is the most beautiful girl, successful, talented, funny, wonderful, caring girl, my 
[02:07:00]  best friend, she also wants to share her life with me.  And it would be the biggest honor of my life if you would marry me.  Does that mean yes?  Yes.  Yeah.  Wow.  Nicole's engaged.  Woo-hoo.  Stand.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  How about that? 
[02:07:30]  What a nice ring and everything, huh?  She's shaking.  Nicole's shaking.  You all right?  Wow.  Hey.  Look at her!  I'm getting married!  Nicole, did you have any clue?  Did you have any clue whatsoever?  I'm shaking.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you.  I don't even want to say what you guys are.  Did I do good for my first time on the radio?  You did good for your first time on the radio.  Oh, how cool is that?  Thank you, boys, for setting this up.  No problem. 
[02:08:00]  Matt and Nicole, everybody!  Matt and Nicole!  All right.  Hey, if you want to call and say congratulations to Matt and Nicole, of course, 877-MY-HITS-1.  Look at that.  Live on the air!  Now, what are you going to do?  It's fine.  It's beautiful.  What are we going to do?  Beat her up?  He did sound very nervous.  Oh, he was fucking...  You know...  Good for her.  Petrified.  Let's tell you, the good thing it was, he wasn't thinking about love or anything like  that, it was all just about, you know, a name change.  I just wish...  It was about a name change.  He would have had a better line after. 
[02:08:30]  Like, you know, we were on the couch, and I just wanted to tell you that I have cancer.  Oh, God!  Oh, Jesus!  With some awfulness.  I'll be dead in three weeks.  Some sadness.  Something sad.  I've been sleeping with your cousin.  Good for her.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Come on.  What are we going to be?  Just complete assholes all the time?  I hope it ends in a sensational trial.  For some reason.  I want to know what happened with the contest, though. 
[02:09:00]  That's what I'm like.  What happened?  Yeah.  Did they figure out the ketchup?  What kind of ketchup was it?  Yeah, I think it was some kind of ketchup thing.  Heinz or what?  Hunt's.  Hunt's?  I hate Hunt's ketchup.  Hunt's tried to be Heinz.  Hunt's is horrible.  She was going for Heinz or fancy McDonald's ketchup, because she took them both out of  Iraq's condiment drawer.  Ah!  Which I don't want to piss off Iraq.  He hates when people take stuff out of there.  Well, no shit.  You don't like when people take stuff out of his condiments drawer?  He's so greedy.  Is he greedy?  He's a greedy boy with his condiments? 
[02:09:30]  He just loves his indulgent treats.  Does he?  Yeah.  He loves to indulge.  He really does.  Just sitting there with his fucking Hitler hairdo and his fucking sweat right where the  hair meets the skull.  Oh, E-Rog.  He doesn't have a fucking Hitler do.  He looks like Hitler at the Eagle's Nest when he's just relaxing and his hair's a little  messy.  Yeah.  Just hanging out with his friends.  Yeah.  Eva just woke up.  They told a few Jew jokes.  She's shaving her pussy in the tub. 
[02:10:00]  Holy shit.  That thing really does get fucking firmly entrenched in your head.  It's like a tick.  Yeah.  It sounds like a tick.  Breaking news.  CBS wants Sheen back.  What?  Go to Drudge.  Let's see if that's real.  Get out of town.  Really? 
[02:10:30]  What the hell's going on in here?  Can't be the truth.  I don't see it.  You don't see it?  Nope.  I don't believe that's true.  Blocked.  Defiant.  Defiant.  I believe that's a lie.  I don't see it.  There it is right there.  CBS wants to show it on Radar Online.  Radar's got it.  Radar gets everything.  They want it back.  Why?  Because they realize.  Maybe because they realize that Mario Lopez or whoever will be a fucking bust.  Yeah.  Whoever they were trying to get.  Whoever.  Stamos or whoever these guys. 
[02:11:00]  You think maybe they've been talking?  His peeps.  They probably don't like the fact that he's going to do this stupid tour thing and make  about seven million dollars.  So they can't have the money thing to hold over.  Well they probably see that he's trying to stay sober and now they're willing to play  a little ball with the guy.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  Hey, your mother-in-law is checking in.  All right.  Your ex-mother-in-law of course.  Oh.  Let's give a...  Judy, what's up?  It's been a while.  Yeah.  It's the worst one ever. 
[02:11:30]  It's so bad, but you know...  It's Julia Child.  It's been a lot of years.  Who knows?  Okay.  So how are you?  I'm all right.  You know, look, it was so wonderful when you were around.  It's the worst ever.  To fix everything around the house.  Now you're gone.  Everything's breaking.  Where'd you go?  I'm going to fix my garage.  I don't even know what he's saying.  Oh, I have to fix the garage?  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Remember that?  Linger Longer.  I had to spend my Christmas vacation fixing air conditioning ductwork and putting in a  garage door opener at her condo.  Yeah.  That was how I used to spend my Christmas vacations, doing errands for my mother-in-law.  Now we've got to save face and get a real one.  A real good one.  Yeah, yeah.  Because that one was horrendous.  That one was it?  Oh!  And make sure you marinate it and then take it out and put it in the oven at $3.50.  That's not Judy. 
[02:12:30]  And when I ask how you are, fine is probably not the answer.  Right.  A banana, a banana, my Judy.  Yes.  All right.  We'll do a break.  Prone is probably the right.  Yes.  We've got a sports guy crying after the break.  Did he have two bad knees?  Was he from Akron or Dayton?  Sports guy crying.  Oh, no.  We've got to do technical version at the break.  You got that?  All right.  Good.  Good.  I didn't forget.  A little technical version for everybody.  And then a sports guy crying after the break. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  And maybe it's long, but they interviewed the bully.  Oh, they did that fat kid?  Yeah.  No, the skinny kid?  They interviewed the kid who was bullied.  But then the other guy turned into a bully.  No, he was just defending himself.  He was defending himself.  No one even looks at the fat kid as saying he was the bully.  But why would they suspend the kid?  The video really shows that.  Like fucking King Kong.  So he's supposed to just get punched in the face?  You saw the video, right?  Yeah.  What do they want him to do?  He had punched?  You're supposed to turn around and tell somebody.  The guy sat there and took a lot. 
[02:13:30]  I know.  The whole country is fucking just snitches.  That's it.  That's why we spy on each other and we're all tattletales.  Because that's what they're taught in school.  Yep.  Not that you should want a fist fight.  But just run and tell someone immediately when something happens.  Don't handle it yourself.  Immediately run and tattle.  Tell.  Immediately run and tattle.  He fucked up that kid too, man.  Exactly.  That kid got what he deserved.  When that kid got up, he didn't know where the fuck he was.  Oh, he tossed his ass on the ground.  It was fantastic to watch.  It was beautiful. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  We got audio of the kid that was being bullied and then turned around and really took care  of the situation.  Mm-hmm.  School decided they had to suspend him anyway.  Not as much as the other kid, but still.  They didn't have to suspend him at all.  All right.  So we got...  The skinny kid was great trying to get up and he's all wobbly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wobbly.  Oh, boy, was he wobbly.  Yeah, we'll get into that next.  Stay there.  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college, a career, maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant. 
[02:14:30]  That's why I choose anal sex.  I mean, sure, it hurts a little, and I wind up walking funny for a day or two, but I think  my future's worth it.  Anal sex.  The smart choice for your future.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Burnt between screens.  That this deed can be done.  Can be done.  Whoa! 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  I think we're rocking here.  A little bit.  We're rocking.  To make the devil cry.  Cry!  Yeah.  Is it possible to make the devil cry?  No!  That guy's a happy man.  He's got a bunch of souls.  He's got some shit going on.  He's got torture.  He's having a good run around the world, the devil, huh?  Yeah.  Ugh, stupid Michael Moore. 
[02:15:30]  Note to the Muslim world.  I guess we're bombing slash invading you in alphabetical order.  Sorry, Morocco.  That's kind of funny.  Not!  He is...  I don't know why I decided to follow Michael Moore.  And it is just to get me annoyed.  Because you guys agree politically?  No.  Well, believe me.  He's a little more dishonest about his political stance.  Obama gets in touch with his inner... 
[02:16:00]  And then he just, like, does things.  Yeah, we fired a hundred tomahawk missiles.  And it's Olivia.  I think of the teachers.  We couldn't get...  Whatever.  You fork over your own money for teachers then.  Can't stand him.  Oh, by the way.  What happened?  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear Travis. 
[02:16:30]  Thanks.  Happy birthday.  It's good.  It's the big one.  It's one of the big fucking milestone birthdays, right?  It sure is.  Does it suck?  Yeah.  Are you freaking a little bit?  It's the only time...  If my grandmother was still alive, every year she would say,  Dad, do you feel older?  Yeah.  This would be the one time I would say yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You look older if that's any kind of relation.  Nice.  That's not going to help me today.  You look really old.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Actually.  Yeah, kind of...  You were really young when you started working here.  Oh, remember?  He was a kid full of piss and vinegar all ready to go. 
[02:17:00]  I was 23 when I started.  23.  God, and now he's fucking 30.  Now you look like shit.  Your body's falling apart.  You're an average 40, a heinous 30.  Holy shit.  You're a great 50.  You're supposed to learn things as you get older.  You're just dumb.  Still.  Wow.  Well, that's not nice.  That has nothing to do with my birthday.  What a great birthday you're having.  That's good.  We went to Travis's surprise birthday party at Dave & Buster's in Times Square.  I wasn't invited. 
[02:17:30]  I wasn't invited either, so you're bringing up a very awkward thing.  Well, I think everybody...  Everybody knew everybody else was busy.  I didn't know.  No.  I had no idea.  Hey, look.  It was Lisa that invited me.  I'm fucking...  I'm not taking responsibility for anything.  I wasn't invited.  It's Lisa's fault.  Why weren't we invited?  I know Lisa likes me.  Why didn't she invite me?  I thought she liked me, too.  Because everyone knew you were in Boston.  When I went to the hockey game, we all got along.  It was very nice.  Yeah.  What happened, Travis?  I wasn't in Boston.  What happened? 
[02:18:00]  Look at Travis.  Why wouldn't I be invited?  I'd give Canadians tickets.  I'd help save your job.  Oh, shit.  That was a tough one.  That is true.  That wasn't an easy one, sir.  That's a good question.  I didn't even know there was a problem.  I didn't even know there was a problem.  Not even an invite.  Oh, man.  If there's a problem, maybe someone should tell me.  Well, Opie, if it's any consolation, you should be glad you didn't go. 
[02:18:30]  I wouldn't have went.  I was at UFC.  That Dave and Buster is in that part of Times Square where those screening theaters are.  Yeah.  You know, by Chevys and stuff?  Yeah.  Where the police fucking have to have a permanent command post.  You know those buses?  The police command post buses.  They pretty much could pull the wheels off this thing and just leave it sitting there.  Because that's where the most shit happens in Times Square.  Wow.  That's like the shitty part of Times Square.  Isn't that 42nd?  Yeah, yeah.  It's 42nd, but it's off of Broadway and shit. 
[02:19:00]  It's like closer to 8th Avenue and shit.  Yeah.  That's where the two movie theaters are, too, right?  Yep.  The gang theaters.  Where one gang has one theater, one gang's got the other theater.  That's a rumor.  I wonder if that's true.  I bet it is, because all I saw were gang guys.  Is it true, though?  Gang, gang, gang.  Seems like it might be.  Gang, gang, gang.  I saw a lot of gangbangers in Dave & Buster's.  And all I could do was have people I know stand near certain games so I could make like  I was taking pictures of them.  And I took about 30 pictures of what looks to be gangbangers using those shooting games. 
[02:19:30]  Wow.  So I got a fuckload of those.  And little kids, like little kids with their, I guess their dad.  I don't know.  But they're maybe an uncle.  And they're kind of teaching the kids how to shoot these machine guns.  That would have been fun to go to.  Sure would have been, Jimmy.  But, you know.  Talk to Lisa.  Nah, that's all right.  What am I going to say?  Obviously, she's got a problem.  Maybe she'll tell me someday. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, man.  I didn't do anything.  I didn't do anything.  You guys were away.  You were in Philly.  You were in Boston, I think, right?  No.  No one knew that.  No.  You were in Boston.  I was back by Saturday.  No one knew that.  No, you weren't.  I was so.  Oh.  I have a mouthful of turkey.  Oh, shit.  I'm the turkey kid.  So you got some good pictures of it, though?  Yeah.  Got some good pictures of some young thugs using plastic guns.  Nice. 
[02:20:30]  It's pretty exciting to watch.  I saw the one, but it's hard to see.  Yeah, it is hard to see.  There's two gangsters going at it.  That looks like Lil Wayne.  Lil Wayne was on the shotgun with one of his boys.  There were a couple of them.  I put most of them on my phone.  I didn't put many up on Twitter, though.  Right.  But that was very entertaining.  And then trying to go to the bar to get a drink without stepping on someone's toe or bumping into somewhere or brushing against somebody at the bar where they would turn around and go, 
[02:21:00]  oh, you got a problem, motherfucker, or something, was just unbearable.  Like, I would try to find the only two white people at the bar and try to sneak between them.  Like, oh, boy.  I don't want any trouble.  You can't get into it.  Here's Anthony's logic, number 265.  You can't get in a gunfight in Dave and Buster's.  There's just too many children. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, Jesus.  So you pretty much just got to take the beating.  You're going to have to take the beating.  What are you going to do?  Open up?  That's a rough area.  You can't open up.  Yeah, so that was fun.  And that was Travis's 30th.  Goddamn.  You were just 20 fucking three.  Sounds like fun.  What happened?  How'd you get so old?  Good time for all.  I would have got you a stuffed animal, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Danny was winning a bunch of stuffed little fish. 
[02:22:00]  That's great.  Now I've got, like, a dozen new toys in my house.  You would have had two dozen.  And he pawned off on me.  Doesn't the dog eat them?  No.  Oh.  What about the child?  No, the baby just.  The baby.  Oh, puppy.  Oh, they're made in China.  It's okay.  It's probably not too much lead and horrible things and radioactivity.  All right.  Well, happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  I love birthday parties.  I love them.  Party, party.  Fun, fun, fun. 
[02:22:30]  Lisa, give up the butt.  Aw, damn.  It's your birthday.  It's 30.  It's got to be, right?  Do we have other things to talk about?  Not at all.  I made a whole prep sheet for you guys.  Did you do that?  Are you in the back door?  I can't wait to get a text from him.  Very good.  All right.  Hey, uh.  Damn it.  I asked fuck once in a while, but not as much as I should.  No one asked. 
[02:23:00]  It's been a while.  You don't want to get used to it.  It's been a while since I went shitter diving, as I call it.  Shitter diving?  I say that to my girl.  Is that face first you're talking?  No, dick first.  Oh, dick first?  I want to go shitter diving.  And she says, stop being so romantic.  No, what she'll do is I'll say, hey, why don't you bite the pillow?  I want to drill for Earl.  I wonder what kind of response you'd get. 
[02:23:30]  She just opens her ass cheeks and puts her face in the pillow with her iPod on.  And I got Earl driven.  Oh, shit.  I'm drilling.  Oh, look.  They're holding up pieces of cruise missile.  What do you got?  In Libya.  They always do that.  I know.  They love collecting souvenirs after we drop them on top of them.  Check this out.  Is that Nick Roberts?  Which guy is that guy?  He's been in Egypt, Japan, and now Libya. 
[02:24:00]  He's that English guy, right?  I think so.  Does he have an English accent?  I think so.  I don't even know.  I can't even identify these guys anymore.  Where's Anderson Cooper?  Anderson is back, I think.  Can we Google map that motherfucker?  Is he okay?  He's on vacation and shit.  What's with this old woman holding up fucking parts?  She's trying to sell them.  Anybody need an actuator for a tail fin of a cruise missile?  Did you see the...  Anyone?  Nose cone?  Did you see the Muslim woman with the AK-47 shooting into the sky?  Into the air?  That was into the... 
[02:24:30]  It was in the paper yesterday.  It's a great picture.  Was she shooting at a plane or just celebrating?  No, she was trying to shoot at the planes.  Yeah?  Did you see the picture?  I did not.  A hell of a shot.  She had an actuator.  She had the traditional garb on.  You know when you get an actuator?  Where?  At an actual restaurant.  They serve you.  They do.  They do.  Get it?  Unfortunately, I did.  If it helps, it was in the Daily News yesterday.  The New York Daily News.  It was Daily News.  It was a great shot.  I should have tweeted. 
[02:25:00]  It was pretty fucking cool.  Cool picture.  Yeah, she was going to town?  Yeah, it was scary as shit.  Not in a town.  Yeah.  We don't have a scene.  They don't care who fucking takes up arms over there when that happens.  You little kids, women, they're just firing away.  And the same woman that helped defend these people, if she shows a little fucking kneecap,  she gets stoned in the head.  They're savages.  Well, you know.  Well, you know.  Give them what they deserve.  Is that what you're saying, Jim?  No.  I don't eat potato chips very much, but I got some, I only ate once yesterday, which 
[02:25:30]  was terrible.  Yeah.  These baked glaze, cheddar, and sour crumb.  Sour crumb?  How good are they?  Fucking.  How great.  Dude, I'm wetting my finger and digging into the corner.  You can never have enough potato chips.  I've never figured a chick with this much vigor.  These are amazing.  Are you a salt and vinegar guy?  Sure.  Those are my favorites. 
[02:26:00]  I want to lick a pretzel and smell it.  Yeah.  Yeah?  I used to lick chick.  I don't like pretzels.  Pretzels suck.  Oh, pretzels fucking own.  That's a good if you've got enough beer.  Dude, pretzels with some fucking, some mustard.  You get some Dijon mustard.  Mustard.  I like some mustard.  I love mustard.  You like mustard?  I'm a fan of the mustard.  I love mustard.  Now, you're talking hard pretzels.  What about soft pretzels?  I'm talking about pretzels across the fucking board.  No way.  Soft pretzels?  Big, gushy, cushy, soft pretzels?  Obviously, I've spent a lot of time in Philly, and they rant and rave about their pretzels, 
[02:26:30]  and they suck, too, the soft pretzels.  I fucking hate pretzels.  A New York pretzel?  You don't like a fucking, a good?  No.  Some mustard?  Schneider's almost.  No.  Schneider's pretzels.  What about those pretzel nuggets?  I love the sourdough nuggets.  I love the little shits that fall out of you.  The worst ones are the pretzel assholes, they fall.  The worst ones are the thin ones?  What, like pretzel sticks?  Ah, but the really thin ones?  The ones that are shaped like the Rheingold symbol?  Oh, fuck that.  For old Rheingold beer?  Why have pretzels when you can have potato chips?  I prefer, I don't, I don't, I like chips, but, dude, pretzels, what's that? 
[02:27:00]  But pretzels with some fucking mustard.  Mustard.  Dude, are amazing.  I love.  Mustard.  I love a good, a fucking hard on the bottom, like a little bit burned to New York pretzel.  Yeah.  And you put some fucking Gouldens up there, up on that bitch.  That is good shit.  I mean, I didn't get my nickname for nothing.  What, I don't even want, I'm not going to ask you.  You don't have to, it's fine.  Sorry.  The Pretzel Guild.  No, no.  You're not supposed to say the nickname if no one asks you.  That's the rules. 
[02:27:30]  He couldn't hold back.  That's the rules.  Actually, they used to call me Pretzeli in high school.  Pretzeli.  You gotta have the Italian name.  Hey, they call him Pretzel.  Pretzeli.  Go, pretty.  Anybody else want to explain to me why it's snowing today when they said it wasn't supposed  to snow?  It's fallout.  It's not radiation raining.  That's what I was going to say.  They did say it could get a little cooler in the upper atmosphere.  Or is it only getting snow north and west of our area?  Is it snow this high up and by the time it hits the ground it's rain? 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  We're pretty high up.  Yeah, that's what happens.  We're supposed to get a little rain.  Pringles rule.  Nah.  Uh-huh.  Fuck yeah.  You know what?  I will lick and smell some Pringles and eat them in a second.  If I'm really hungry, I'll have the Pringles.  But they don't be...  I like your standard issue, Lay's or Wise, regular fucking potato chip.  Fuck out of here.  Better than anything.  They're good.  Believe me, barbecue, things like that, I'm all over it.  But I like your standard issue, Pretzeli.  You think Pringles makes hoarders very nervous? 
[02:28:30]  And does it stress them out?  Why?  They save the cans, those assholes.  Because they're stacked all nice.  They are stacked very neatly.  Don't they need their potato chips all willy-nilly in a bag?  In a bag?  Not all stacked up nicely.  I think someone OCD would get all fucked up that you're unstacking them and making them messy.  Who would be more fucked up by Pringles, hoarders or OCD people?  OCD.  They love them because they're all the same.  But why would they be fucked up?  They got it in a nice order for themselves to eat.  Because when you're eating them, you're messing the order up. 
[02:29:00]  No, but you're eating them...  What?  Was that kind of wheelchair?  These guys are just losing the war.  Why is...  He's in an office chair.  Sitting in an office chair in the middle of the street with a rifle just shooting up in the sky in Libya.  But you still don't have the one of the lady?  Fuck.  It was in the Daily News.  I swear to you.  There's been some rad pictures.  If someone could tweet that, I'll fucking give you a little retweet action.  You know, it's cool.  It's cool to see some really classic aircraft doing battle. 
[02:29:30]  You really don't see a lot of the old aircraft they're using over Libya.  It's kind of cool.  Look at that fucking thing.  An old MiG or something.  What the fuck is that?  The Libyans are using it?  Yeah.  That thing looks like a...  What the hell is it?  It actually looks like an old Sabre.  And then they have like F-4 Phantoms, F-16s that we sold them years ago.  It's just cool to see like old planes.  You see that one that was hit and just crashing straight down on fire like a dart? 
[02:30:00]  There's some shit going on over there.  Man, you don't want any part of that.  What were we just talking about?  Potato chips.  Friday.  Oh.  No, potato chips.  And Kenny's dry hair.  No, we didn't mention Kenny's.  No, not today?  No, we didn't mention.  Thanks.  Fuck.  Kenny, you're singing Friday, Friday.  Friday, Friday.  Kenny always looks like he's wearing an asbestos hat.  Wait, what was I saying?  His barber got mesothelioma. 
[02:30:30]  I don't know.  It's something about...  Oh, wait.  So this is the famous turkey chili, huh?  This is famous.  God damn it.  Oh, does this smell good?  Potato chips and pretzels.  Oh, delicious.  And Pringles.  No, wait.  There's something about potato chips.  Oh, the one I don't like about the Ys.  As much as they're good...  Yeah.  They're too smart.  Yes, they are.  They always hide from me.  They're very wise potato chips.  They hide in the pretzel bag, so you can't find them.  They tell you an old story before you eat them.  Yes.  And they have little owl shit in them. 
[02:31:00]  I hate when there's owl shit on my potato chips.  Is there...  I heard you.  Now, everyone has their favorite potato chip, but is there a bad bag of potato chips is the  real question.  You could jazz them up with the salt and vinegar and all this other stuff, but is there actually  a bad potato chip?  Why is it good, but your fingers get too greasy?  Oh, my God.  And then whenever you go to hold a document, you get your fingerprints.  Oh, you do.  It becomes translucent.  Yeah.  A little transparency.  Do you know how much trouble I got in when I was handling the Shroud of Turin? 
[02:31:30]  I had eaten a bunch of potato chips, and I got a thumbprint on JC's eye, because I was  leaning over.  With your greasy, wise potato chip fingers?  I didn't think...  Yeah, and I was eating wise potato chips, and they asked me, could you look at the Shroud  and give us an opinion?  And I leaned on it, because there was a girl bending over, and I wanted to look into her  asshole.  I put my finger on it, and I leaned over.  Boy, they sure are getting lackadaisical with that thing.  Yeah, they...  They should really protect it a little better. 
[02:32:00]  Because I wrote a letter, I said, I can guess the age of anything.  Can you?  I like when you get a nice, big potato chip out of a bag.  Oh, the big, giant one.  It's like a three-biter.  Do you know what I'm thinking of?  The joy I would take, as you got one of those, to fucking karate kick it out of your hand  onto the floor?  Oh, Jimmy, that's meanness.  Why are we doing this bit?  Is someone getting engaged?  No, it's no bit.  Are we setting up someone's engagement here?  No, but now he's got me thinking of potato chips. 
[02:32:30]  Do you eat the green ones?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Anything...  No, throw them away.  Dude, if I saw a fucking...  If I saw a pig fetus in a potato chip bag, I would eat it.  Whatever's in the fucking bag, I eat a shoelace, a fucking baseball card, potato chips, salt.  It would just taste good.  Yeah, a hardened fart.  I'd fucking eat anything.  You know what I used to do with fucking Drake's Yankee Doodles?  Throw them at Black's.  Sorry, Drew.  Drew Boogie's in studio, but I'm making fun of ants, obviously. 
[02:33:00]  Drew would laugh.  Come on.  Yes.  Drew's so white.  No, but Drew's black, but he knows what I'm saying.  He knows we're racists.  Is Drew...  Don't weird.  Don't want butts in here.  Is Drew a comfortable color for you?  Yeah, I love Drew, man.  He's comfortable enough.  Patrice?  Did I say Patrice?  Well, Patrice is a little dark.  That's got to make you uncomfortable.  How about Keith Robinson?  You don't know Keith as well.  I don't know Keith enough.  He had a great story last time how he threatened to punch a cop in the face. 
[02:33:30]  Why?  He was actually...  The way he handled it was...  Oh, what did he ask him for an ID?  Whoa, shit.  But Keith was riding home, and he said he was going up 8th Avenue, and I guess he went  because the turns are all confusing now.  8th Avenue?  Colored?  Yeah.  I was like, well, you asked for it.  But he said he got pulled over, and he was annoyed, and he says to the cop, he goes,  what, what, uh, somebody, what are you stopping me for, man?  Or something like that.  Why? 
[02:34:00]  But the cop goes, don't call me man, boy.  Oh, nice.  Wow.  And, uh, he said, he said to the cop, I'll punch you in your fucking face.  And the cop's like, what?  And they got him out of the car.  But he said the cop started to defuse it.  Because Keith didn't raise his hands.  He was on the car, he didn't get arrested.  But he said that the cop started to defuse it.  I think because the cop knew that if that goes, I'm just, you know, obviously if that  goes into the report, that's a problem.  Well, he was being lippy. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  Keith, uh, no love loss between Keith and the police.  I know.  You can't, you can't threaten to punch a cop.  No.  But that, you know, that was a little one to call for, to call him boy.  Yeah.  Hey, don't call him man.  There's a difference in implication there.  Not, not the one I saw, but.  Oh yeah.  Look at her.  She's having fun.  I'll put a lady, put a nice Kalashnikov.  Yeah.  She's a good job.  She's, she's in the traditional garb with a AK type of shooting it in the air.  At least now they're shooting it in the air at things. 
[02:35:00]  It's refreshing to see him actually trying to shoot something.  So just in the air.  Really?  You might, you might need those bullets later.  Do you know what I hate?  It's like when you're, when you're trying to be quiet and you're like burglarizing a place  and you forgot that you have four bags of potato chips in your coat.  I didn't know we were continuing.  How much noise they make.  Do you know how loud the crinkling of a potato chip is?  Four bags.  Yes.  Full bags.  Very loud.  I like chip clips.  They make your, your potato chips last a lot longer. 
[02:35:30]  Burglarizing.  Yes.  I remember one time I was robbing a museum.  And the, the night guard heard me because my chips were crinkling.  Oh yeah.  I'm just on a bombing spiral at this point.  It doesn't even matter.  There you go.  Oh yeah.  Look at her.  That's the one I saw.  That's barely a woman by the way.  I know.  That's why.  You can just tell from the headgear.  That's why it's so great.  And she's like in traffic.  Yeah.  Like she just got out of her car in traffic and started blasting away at the sky.  She looks like Gerard Depardieu. 
[02:36:00]  Ugly woman.  Oh, that is true.  Yes.  Apple TV in here would be great.  Because you see how you're doing that with your iPad.  Right.  You're showing pictures.  And we have pictures on our phones.  We could all just fucking click right into it and put it up on one of the screens in here.  Are we doing anything to make this show, you know, more advanced?  That would be so fucking cool.  Definitely.  We're going to have to do it.  We can't rely on Bob.  Bob ain't going to do it.  No, we gave them a little thing down the hall. 
[02:36:30]  We'll see what they do.  I actually gave a test shot over the weekend with the compound deal of using Skype.  And it's amazing.  It fucking works.  I could get people on Skype, put their Skype video on a virtual screen behind me, and do  an interview and talk to people visually.  You could see them, you know, you do a little show on your iPad or?  No, this is on the compound studio thing on U Street. 
[02:37:00]  No, I was just popping up viewers because they were pissing me off because they were saying,  you know, the usual stuff, they call me Gomez Adams and things like that, and Gaddafi with  AIDS, shit like, you know, the usual.  So I was like, you know, I want to start seeing some people.  I go, Skype up, you motherfuckers, and let me see what you look like.  And most of them were big, fat assholes that badly needed shaves alone in their basements.  So it was to prove a point, but it also was a good shakedown to see if Skype would work 
[02:37:30]  like that.  And I think in here, that would come in very handy.  Well, yeah.  We should have some Skype-age in here.  Yeah, I agree.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't feel like yelling and screaming anymore.  They know what we want.  Let's get it done.  Okay, it's being worked on.  That's cool.  Good.  If not, we find someone that will take care of us.  Let it rock.  All right, yeah.  Nice.  We've got this guy crying.  Kansas State player Jacob Pullen cries during press conference. 
[02:38:00]  These are always good.  Is he retiring?  He's a college kid.  Oh, what the fuck is he crying about then?  How do you sum up the emotions that come after that?  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's tough.  You know, I want to win.  That's what you wanted to see?  That what you were trying to get out of him?  Oh.  Make him cry here in front of people? 
[02:38:30]  Good question.  I'm a competitive man.  I just wanted to win a game.  I'm kept about a scoring record or anything else, man.  I wanted to get to the final before, and I didn't get a chance to do that.  What was the question?  I guess that was his coach or something?  Yeah.  Somebody getting very pissed at the guy for asking a question about the emotions that he felt.  Who's the coach?  It sounded like Bobby Knight.  Really?  Not as many curses.  Who was it?  We need more info on that clip. 
[02:39:00]  Because that's great that the guy called out the media going, oh, really?  Yeah, because that's why they do it.  Right.  Absolutely why they do it.  Do we know anything else about that?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Do we know who it is, what team he plays for?  Yeah, he plays for Kansas State.  I don't follow college basketball, but I'm assuming that he was a senior.  This was probably his last year.  Oh.  And his last game because they're out.  And his last year since they lost.  Right.  I'm finding the coach's name right now. 
[02:39:30]  It's not Bobby Knight, but it's, I don't know.  I definitely want to hear that again, though, because I like the way the coach stepped in.  He's like, you're happy?  You're happy now?  You made him cry.  How do you sum up the emotions that come after that?  Emotions.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's tough.  You know, I want to win.  That's what you wanted to see?  That what you were trying to get out of him?  Make him cry here in front of people?  Ah, what the crazy.  I'm a competitive, man. 
[02:40:00]  I just wanted to win a game.  I don't care about a scoring record or anything else, man.  I wanted to get to the final four, and I didn't get a chance to do that.  Wow.  Good for the coach.  Yeah, right on.  The coach is right.  He's calling that fucking reporter.  Not that there was a bad question, but that is what he was doing.  No, but you can see it was exactly what he was fucking doing.  By the way, I'm reading about African mango.  This new weight loss thing.  I really want to start eating African mango.  Let's get him in here.  I almost said it's not a guy. 
[02:40:30]  It's a fruit, but I'm like.  A fruit?  Well, even better.  Why is it better than the regular mango?  Don't know.  It's obviously.  Bigger.  Yes.  Bigger, thicker.  Yeah.  It throws faster.  How do you prep it?  I mean, prepare it.  Is it a mango that's just very agitated?  It's an ornery.  I don't know.  It's supposed to be good for weight loss, though.  They said it's.  I bet.  Everything over there is good for weight loss.  It's called AIDS. 
[02:41:00]  You just had.  I got it.  He was like, I got it.  I really didn't have to go that far.  No.  You just had potato chips.  They were delicious.  Only 140 calories.  You can go from potato chips to African mango.  I eat pretty healthy.  Once in a while, like the last couple of days, I've had a few little moments, but I can eat  African mango after that.  12 pounds a month, it helps you lose.  This guy, Steve in Kansas, has been waiting for us to need him.  And today's the day.  Steve, what's up, buddy?  Steve, how are you?  Welcome aboard.  Hey, thanks. 
[02:41:30]  Welcome aboard.  Hi, guys.  Hey, that was Frank Martin, the coach there.  You know, Jacob Pullen pulled 38 points out all by himself.  Nobody else on the team even shows up to play.  And, uh, hold that thought.  I got, I, fuck it.  Hold on one second.  Jordan, he's a regular and he should be a regular.  A Scranton PA.  I want to start eating African mango.  And then, uh, Jordan writes, you left out the second O, Jimmy. 
[02:42:00]  Because the second O would make it.  Man, that's pretty funny.  Now that's funny.  Fucking bravo, Jordan.  I thought he meant Manago.  No.  What do we give Jordan today?  A unicorn or a gold star?  What do you want to give him?  How about a fucking, how about a head injury?  All right, we'll give you a head injury.  How about a fucking Kaiser blade to the head?  Like, what are you going to do with that African mango?  I aim to kill you with it. 
[02:42:30]  What else on, uh, Frank?  You're going to make sport of me.  What about Frank, uh, Martin?  Looks like he sticks out for his players, which is kind of cool.  And he does sound a little like Bobby Knight.  I'm holding to that.  What else you got on him, Steve?  Oh, he's, uh, man, you check out some clips of him online.  He's a, he's a terrifying looking guy, man.  He gives the whole team just a death scare, you know, stare.  He's, uh, yeah, yeah, but, uh, I don't know.  Pulling him out there and, you know, played a game of his career  and, uh, nobody else stepped up and made a shot. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, boy.  Uh, the real Dre on Twitter said the same thing.  Check out vids of him on sidelines.  He's a mean bastard.  Oh, yeah?  He's a mean motherfucker.  One of those pacing, wearing his suit guys.  I hate basketball coaches.  Why, why don't, why?  I don't know.  They just, they all look like that.  It's, it almost seems like a gimmick.  Like, they have to be pacing with their dumb suit on, yelling at people.  I don't, I don't understand how the coach is important in just about every sport. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Players know what to do, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Of course they do.  It's like you get an orchestra conductor.  It's like, stop it.  You're not doing anything.  Well, coach is important.  Baseball, fuck no.  Shut up with that strategy shit.  They all know that.  Yeah.  The baseball guys know.  They all know who to put in and take out and everything.  Of course.  Where to bun, all that dumb crap.  Yeah.  Football.  Football coach.  Football, what?  Basketball coach.  They just run up and down.  Yeah, yelling.  All day long.  And they have that clipboard with the little drawing of the basketball floor on it. 
[02:44:00]  Right, right.  And they put X's on there.  You're going to set a pick here.  I know.  I played the game.  Yeah.  He does look a...  Was that him yelling at the guy?  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.  Frank, first.  It's just music.  Ominous music they're playing in the background of coach yelling.  He looks like a badass.  Yeah.  Good for him.  Let me say hi to Bill from Louisiana. 
[02:44:30]  Hello, Bill.  Hello.  Hey, he sounds a lot like Ron the Lawyer standing up for that kid.  Yeah, we like Ron the Lawyer.  That guy was great.  What's your name?  What do you do?  What's your name?  Character?  Character.  Character.  What do you do for a living?  Character?  Character.  I was going to hate that guy, and then I just loved him.  I know.  He was great.  Ron the Lawyer?  He's the greatest.  Love Ron the Lawyer.  What do you do for a living?  Character?  Character.  Character.  Character.  Go ahead and Beck.  Yeah, what's going on with him?  Old clip.  We didn't get to it, though, and I want to get to it. 
[02:45:00]  He's bringing God into the tsunami thing, isn't he?  He's crazier than a shithouse rat.  Message from God, in case you missed it.  He can't see the connections here.  Now, look.  I'm not saying God is, you know, causing earthquakes.  Well, I'm not saying that he...  I'm not not saying that either.  God...  What God does is God's business.  I have no idea.  But I'll tell you this...  Mysterious ways.  God's not doing that.  He moves a mysterious face.  Because, Mr. Beck, what about the people that do believe in God in that area? 
[02:45:30]  What do they do?  But that's God's, like, thing.  Why didn't he give those people the warning and the prayer thing and say,  Look, here's something that I've got to do for the people that don't believe in me,  so why don't you get the fuck out?  God needs them, too.  Fukushima.  But God needs the good people, too, a lot of times.  Is that how they fucking spin that shit?  That's why he works in mysterious ways.  Because he takes the bad people, but he also takes good people.  Because he needs them for goodness up in heaven.  I think he could just make people up there that would do his bidding. 
[02:46:00]  To think that God decided to take the plates of the earth and have them snap like rubber bands...  Yeah.  Just to teach a...  You idiots out there are fucking...  You dumb motherfuckers.  Because I really...  I can't stomach this God babble.  It's magic.  They believe in magic.  I don't even mind them believing in God.  I'm not saying you shouldn't believe in God. 
[02:46:30]  But to think, when you know what you know about the universe and space and atoms...  Space.  Exactly.  I always have to say it like that.  Fair enough.  I wish I could.  I would.  But just to think that God is actually going to take the plates of the earth...  Yeah.  You fucking dummies.  You're just...  Dummies.  They don't seem to understand what's happening.  I guess they're needed to a certain degree.  Maybe we're all needed.  Like, religious people are needed because without them, maybe without a belief in God, morality 
[02:47:00]  never would have taken hold as a species.  We need a higher law than our own, like, common sense of good, right, and wrong?  Yes, because we have no natural enemies.  Like, for human...  Like, what prevents us from behaving with complete anarchy?  There's a law, but the ultimate is the hereafter.  But wouldn't that dictate that every atheist would just solve a problem by killing somebody?  No, because the atheists are born into a society that has these weird moral laws. 
[02:47:30]  But where did that come from, if not religion?  It could be a...  Well, they said that the...  I've heard it theorized that the God, the ability to...  The desire to believe in God or the need for God is a part of our survival instinct  because it keeps us...  Like, looking to the hereafter is a way of keeping us from completely self-destructing here.  We don't have the natural enemies to do that.  But I like to think that our own intelligence...  I think the more intelligent you are, not that there haven't been genius killers... 
[02:48:00]  Right.  ...because there's always exceptions to the rules, but I think if you're able to rationalize  things and really foresee consequence and have just a natural morality and know right  from wrong, I think that keeps you in check more than the thought that you're going to  be punished by some invisible guy in the clouds.  Well, I'm not talking individuals like you and me.  I mean, as a species...  You mean you're not talking special people?  Right.  I'm not talking gifted, brilliant people with a lot of money who fly first class. 
[02:48:30]  I'm talking about garbage.  Right.  No, no, I mean, like, as a species, way before us, 5,000 years ago, 10,000 years ago, like,  you know, at one point in case, people were just clubbing the shit out of each other and  eating.  Yeah.  And so as we get more...  It's like, I don't mean us, I just think that that's...  That need to have something after, it propels us forward.  And I think the science, people who believe in science completely, also are a needed balance. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because they discovered the cures for diseases and things like that, that religious people  think that God would just handle.  Like, people who are into science find all the answers that people with religion would  just go, ah, God will do it.  I'd just like to know what keeps most people, the majority of people...  I'm not explaining it well.  ...from just beating the shit out of people and killing them to take their stuff.  Let's just say, use that example.  There is an inner morality...  Yes.  ...that we have that I don't know if it's based on religion or not. 
[02:49:30]  It's not...  When I say religion, it's not based on, oh, the Jews or the Muslims or the Christians.  It goes way deeper than that.  It's a piece of us...  It's a spiritual thing.  Not even spiritual.  It's almost like the reason we...  You know, like, for procreation.  Like, sometimes somebody's breath will bother you, or somebody's hair smell will bother you,  and you can never explain why.  And a lot of times, that's probably just so you don't procreate.  That's nature keeping you...  Oh, saying that you two are not combative. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, like, there's little weird things that nature does that we don't even think about,  and I think that's one of the things that nature does to keep us from fucking self-destructing,  is it puts this thing in us.  So do you think it's more an instinctual part of the brain than a learned part?  Like, we have this thing, and even as cavemen, they kind of even then knew, like,  ah, like looking at somebody's head split open that you just cracked open a rock.  Do you think somebody looked and went like, oh, I kind of feel not right about that? 
[02:50:30]  Maybe, yeah, because you look at these cavemen, they would just...  The sun, they would worship this...  We were always looking for something bigger than us to look to.  Always, since we were fucking, you know, smashing each other and shitting outdoors with animal pelts,  we were looking for something bigger.  At one point it was the sun, and then it was this, or...  But every fucking religion, every culture worships something.  We always seem to need a meaning to this whole thing. 
[02:51:00]  Like, everyone needs a meaning because it does end.  Because there was a beginning, and there will be an end to your life.  So there's always this search for this purpose and meaning, and I don't know where that really comes from.  Like, why?  Why the fuck do we really need something and can't just take the little segment that we have here  and just enjoy yourself, treat people all right, they'll treat you all right,  you know, have your fun, make your mistakes, do everything,  but not have to make it mean so much to have anything to do with whatever is after this. 
[02:51:30]  We won't need that.  Again, it's...  Again, all opinion.  Evolutionary, evolution-wise, the whole God thing, I think someday will go away,  maybe a thousand years from now.  I think it was a part of our evolution needed to get us to this point.  And then as science explains things, as we come to realize, like, that's true and that's true,  I think, if you look, religion has taken a...  It's still massive and everywhere, but there's a lot more doubt about religion, I think, than there ever was. 
[02:52:00]  I think as far as science, when science starts spitting shit out that is really pretty irrefutable...  A lot of it.  You do start going like, eh, well...  And I think that eventually, the need to believe in a God...  And I still don't know how I feel about it,  but I think eventually the need to believe in a God through evolution will be gone.  And that's when he'll come back pissed as a motherfucker.  Very angry.  The second the last person goes, I don't think I believe in...  The sky opens up. 
[02:52:30]  You want to see an earthquake.  That's it.  Or once we know what God...  I was watching another show on the Big Bang and the possibility of it.  And just the idea that a being who somehow is like me is actually thinking of me and you,  it just...  The more I learn scientifically and the more preposterous it is.  And even if there is a God, I just don't think it's what...  None of the religions have it right.  No, I think it's so incompreh...  In or un? 
[02:53:00]  Incomprehensible.  Incomprehensible to us with our limited brain,  if there is some super being as to what it even is,  that we make up the story of the guy with the big puffy beard living in the clouds.  We're no different than fucking Greek mythology.  Zeus and before them, they were no different than looking at the sun before they knew what it was.  And they thought it fucking cared about them.  And it was a big ball of gas that will fucking eventually burn us to death. 
[02:53:30]  Yes.  Before we know what something is, we worship it like idiots.  We really are dopes.  Oh, the bus on!  It gives us a circle!  Hey, fucko.  We're going around it.  It's not going...  It's a fucking ball of gas.  Yeah.  That's it.  Here.  There's your God.  You hold it.  I love that it cares about you.  You can light...  You light cigarettes with your God.  But that's a great thought.  They probably thought it cared about you. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, they did.  They cared about them.  Yes.  I know.  That's hysterical.  I know it's a great line, but I get it.  That is hysterical, man.  What about...  We came up with the consequences of, you know, if you do all this bad, that keeps you intact.  Right.  In check, I should say.  I don't know if we as people came up with it.  Was it so insane?  Was it so crazy?  And then we started thinking, you know, if we get some laws and stuff and some consequences,  maybe we can knock down the numbers of people misbehaving.  But I think you have to know, like, just know it. 
[02:54:30]  Like, without anyone telling you that something is bad to do, you'll get a feeling that this  isn't right.  Like, and that's something we have that I don't think any other creature on the planet has.  Right.  It's this inner, wow, that isn't right.  Or even not murder.  It doesn't have to be as bad as murder.  Or just stealing from someone or doing something to screw someone over.  It's like you know.  You know that it's not a right thing to do.  But it's based on these right and wrong rules that are very gray. 
[02:55:00]  It's not this, you know, plus or minus mathematical equation.  If you had no consequences today when you left this building, wouldn't you do some shit?  I would do some shit.  But you would do some shit.  I would do some shit.  All right, but there are consequences emotionally if there are no consequences.  If you say no consequences, which mean you don't feel bad, then you'd go crazy.  I would do some shit.  I don't know how bad it would get.  With no legal ramifications, you still would feel awful for doing stuff to people. 
[02:55:30]  Would you after a while?  Yes.  That's the question.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Did we invent that?  I think that's that instinctual part of us that just something knows.  I don't know if it's black or white like you think.  We all know right from wrong.  When you just throw something through a fucking big window, that would feel so good.  I did that as a kid.  It is fun, but you know it was wrong, but you laughed your balls off.  No one really got hurt.  So I don't know if I'd put that on the same thing, but still, you still know it wasn't  right to do.  But you bummed out somebody doing that.  Some store owner that took pride in his business or whatever it was that you did. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  I think I would absolutely do some shit if there was no consequences.  But like how bad?  I don't know.  That's the question.  Would you kill someone?  Would you rape?  Would you like, what would you do?  I got a list.  I got a list.  I got a list.  So it's not out of the question.  See, I don't know.  But that's the question everyone has in their head.  How much?  I think most people would do some shit if there was no consequences.  But what?  Right, right.  Sure would.  But how far would you go?  Exactly.  How far?  How far are you going?  I don't really have the answer to that. 
[02:56:30]  How far are you going?  I really don't.  But I know I would just walk home and do some shit.  I would just do some shit.  Would you just do some shit?  Yes.  Now, in dreams, I've done that.  But then you wake up.  And sometimes even in dreams, you'd wake up with kind of a weird, like, ew feeling of what you did.  But in real life, I mean, I've always thought, and my friends always wanted to do some fucking crazy shit when we were younger and stuff.  Right.  And I would always think, like, three steps ahead and go, if we do this and then this happens and that happens, someone could really get hurt. 
[02:57:00]  And, like, I would think of a chain of events consequences, and that would stop me from doing shit.  Really?  Because I never wanted to feel like I was directly responsible for fucking someone's shit up.  You think too much.  I know, and that's what happens when I try to sleep, and it's all in my head.  I told a story.  Me and my, we would go to my friend's house and just throw rocks at the old lady that swept her fucking back.  That's brilliant.  Yeah, but we weren't thinking if we hit her that we could basically kill her. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  We didn't think that far ahead.  We just thought it was hilarious at the time.  You were right.  Well, that is funny.  We would just throw rocks at her.  Snowballs into the highway.  Things like that.  We did that.  Like that, I would always think if someone fucks up and crashes.  Right.  Now you're fucking, nah.  I'm going to get in trouble.  That's why you don't do it.  Because I'm going to get in trouble.  And religion and God, the concept of that is just the ultimate version of going to get in trouble.  The ultimate I'm in trouble.  We stopped throwing snowballs when we got, in my little mind, I was nine or 10, maybe 11. 
[02:58:00]  We got the shit beat out of us.  And maybe it was just a couple.  That's a great one.  Maybe it was just a couple punches.  But my little brain, as I remember back to this event, we got this shit kicked out of us.  And then I had to go inside and not tell our parents why we were fucking hurting for days.  We were throwing, behind my house was a little hill, and we would throw them into 25A for the local people.  Yeah.  Which is a pretty busy fucking two-lane highway.  One lane this way, one lane that way. 
[02:58:30]  But they would fly.  You could see the cars coming from the garage that was disconnected from our house.  So you would time it.  It's like, okay, as soon as the car hits the garage, you loft that motherfucker.  And now in the front of the house, most likely, you got a good shot of hitting this thing.  We're laughing our fucking balls off until a guy circles back into the woods.  He obviously parked a couple houses down, circled back in the woods, and beat the shit out of us.  Beat the shit out of you.  A grown man.  Good for him.  And I don't know how bad the beating was, but in my little mind, it was as bad as you could get beat up at that age. 
[02:59:00]  Good for him.  And then going home, going inside all achy and trying to be cool, because now we're scared we're going to get in trouble.  Of course.  Trouble.  But that stopped me from throwing snowballs is what I'm getting at.  The ultimate trouble.  Me and my friend Marvin.  I love Marvin.  Yeah, me too.  Marvin.  We hit this car with snowballs one time.  We hit Marvin's shed.  At 5 o'clock.  And the guy came looking for us.  And it was night.  You know, it might have been 8 or 9 o'clock at night.  And I'll never forget, me and him are quietly in the shed. 
[02:59:30]  The guy actually came in the shed.  He poked his head and looked, but he didn't, because the shed was dark.  It was like a big shed.  Get the fuck out of here.  It was like a big, it was almost like a giant guest room.  It was like all kinds of, it was like a garage.  Oh no, it was an old garage.  I'm sorry.  So it was big.  And the guy didn't come in though.  He was, you could tell it was like, because he couldn't see what was going to happen.  Yeah, yeah.  He couldn't see you guys?  No, we were hiding.  But he knew you went in there?  I think he suspected.  Oh, shit.  I would have shit my pants.  That's scary.  We were scared.  I almost said, okay, I'm here.  I was, I'm such a faggot. 
[03:00:00]  Shut up.  I didn't.  I'm here.  I'm here.  That would have just thrown a paint can out of me.  Yeah, that's true.  You probably thought somebody could have been in there to blindside him when he walked in.  Is Marvin still alive?  Marvin.  Yes, he is.  Oh, good.  Yeah, yeah.  Marvin was a good guy.  You tell a lot of Marvin stories.  I love Marvin.  He was one of my best friends growing up.  Why don't you talk to him anymore?  I don't know.  He moved away.  You know how it is.  People move on.  They get gay.  They get AIDS and die.  They do, yeah.  That could happen. 
[03:00:30]  I don't think it happened to Marvin.  Young Richard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's still hurting over that.  Yeah, I'm still hurting.  You still regret not taking that blowjob.  Yeah, that probably would have been good.  You would have fucking, you know how fast you would have come?  What if I would have turned gay?  Young, experienced, warm Richard mouth.  On your fucking dry, ugly dick.  His unkept penis.  That would have been something else.  His wily pubes.  His wily.  Just so unkept.  My wily pubes.  And his fucking heavy boy balls. 
[03:01:00]  They smelled like horseback.  Smelled like leather saddle and dirty animal.  Hair growing halfway up the shaft.  Just fucking all unkept.  He'd have loved it.  He would have been so shocked at how good Richard's mouth felt.  Yeah.  Because he'd never had a mouth on his cock before.  And he would have just felt like a little hand.  It would have been like awkward.  Then he would have just felt the warmth of a mouth.  Right.  And the swirling tongue.  He'd have been like, oh boy.  And Ant would have just questioned everything because he would have went like, oh, and tingled. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, that's like too good.  Right, right.  It's not gay if you close your eyes.  Yeah.  Because then, you know, it could be a chick.  Well, those were fucking slammed shut.  Your first load.  The first load you ever dumped.  You would have felt fucking hard plywood on one side.  You'd have been laying on your side with your little fucking knees half bent.  Yes.  With the smell of the eucalyptus tree that the tree fort was made in.  And the light smell of horse manure from my underwear. 
[03:02:00]  Yes.  From the horse ranch.  And yeah, wow.  You know.  You would have shot.  Your body would have just.  You probably would have shit and cum at the same time.  Because your young, confused, fucking nerd body would know how to handle such a warm mouth.  What the fuck, right?  I bet you he would have knew he had you, too.  Oh, God, that's funny.  He would have been tooting on it, and then your hips would have started bucking and moving. 
[03:02:30]  If I would have, like, thrust into it, it would have been over, Johnny.  You would have just given it up.  Yeah.  Is this based on a story, Jimmy?  One of 50.  All right.  Because it's a little too visual.  It's fantastic.  Got a wild imagination.  Yeah.  You want to go back to the Glenn Beck God clip?  Yes.  What is he saying?  Do we have to back up, or are we good where we are?  We're good.  I think we're good.  This is God's business.  I have no idea.  But I'll tell you this.  Whether you call it Gaia, or whether you call it Jesus, there's a message being sent. 
[03:03:00]  And that is, hey, you know that stuff we're doing?  Not really working out real well.  Maybe we should stop doing some of it.  I'm just saying.  And yesterday, I got home, and I was thinking about all the messages that I could bring  you, and all the things that I could tell you, and oh, I've got stuff on Hezbollah.  Oh, I've got, oh, I have stuff on Radical Islam in America that'll make your eyes fall out.  I don't want that.  Or, I could just tell you the answer. 
[03:03:30]  And the answer is...  Get the fuck out of here, really.  Jimmy farts right on you, and the answer is...  That really is the answer.  A good gasser can cure anybody, whatever problem you're having.  Whatever ails you.  A good gasser helps.  That's awesome.  Gasser.  That's awesome.  Just tell you the answer.  And the answer is...  Buckle up. 
[03:04:00]  Buckle up.  Because it's going to be a bumpy ride.  Yeah, do you think it is?  Make sure you keep your arms and legs inside the car at all times.  I use that one a lot.  Because things are going to get bumpy.  And just a few reminders there at the beginning.  As this roller coaster takes off, always a good safety tip.  Keep your arms and legs in.  Don't do anything stupid.  What do you say we follow the big top ten?  You can call them Moses' Ten Commandments, or ten rules of them. 
[03:04:30]  What do you say we start doing those things?  Because the things we are doing really suck.  And we're not getting better.  He's right, except for the God stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  That whole God thing is...  So that's what God does.  That's what the all-seeing, all-knowing being does.  He shapes...  What do they call the tectonic plates?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He makes them snap like a rubber band,  and then sends water to fucking just kill a whole bunch of innocent people 
[03:05:00]  while a lot of shit is...  Then God's...  If God does that, then God's a boob.  Blaspheme!  Blaspheme!  God is a boob if that's what God does.  Is he a boob?  A boob.  And lazy!  Fucking lazy!  How about this?  If you really have that much time for individuals,  as the all-seeing, all-knowing being...  Almighty.  Almighty!  Yes.  How about you just fuck over the lousy ones? 
[03:05:30]  Because he needs good people.  He'll save you a lot of time, right?  How would you...  Yeah, but how about this?  Let's say you were throwing something out in your house.  Yeah.  And you didn't want to look through what you needed and what you didn't need,  and you just threw everything out.  People would go, wow, you're an asshole.  Oh, the good with the bad.  Yeah, that would kind of suck.  So if God did do the earthquake or the tsunami,  then God is fucking lazy.  He's lazy, and he doesn't want to think,  and he doesn't want to pick off people individually.  Yeah, I gotta agree with you on that one. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, how about we criticize God for being lazy?  Nobody would mind if there was an earthquake,  and 12,000 pedophiles were killed.  In a freak accident,  3,000 rapists' head burst into flames.  God kicks ass.  How about for once,  God fucking sipped through the rubble a little bit,  instead of wiping out a whole bunch of people?  Because basically, what is the use of me being good  if I'm going to get fucking flooded 
[03:06:30]  with a bunch of ass-fucking rapists?  Why should I be good?  Because then in the afterlife,  those ass-fucking rapists are in hell,  burning with the eternal pitchfork up their ass,  and you will be at the right hand,  enjoying the wealth of the afterlife.  And a part of me will probably go,  look, I'm glad to be here,  but do you really have to do that again?  There's a lot of kids down there.  Do you have to give that kid a tumor in his stomach?  Yeah.  Really? 
[03:07:00]  Do you have to do that?  And meanwhile,  I just read an interview with Lawrence Bitteker,  who is a fucking serial killer rapist  who fucking tortured teenagers with pliers,  and he's still alive.  Do you have to be so fucking lazy?  How about one ounce of stick-to-itiveness?  Well, Jim,  I never thought about it that way.  You make a good point.  And why are the streets gold?  It's chilly on my feet.  It's worthless up here.  Are they really paved with gold?  Listen, 
[03:07:30]  why do the roads have to be paved  with something that's very slippery?  I wear my socks,  I fall all over.  I chip my teeth twice on your gold fucking sleeve.  What's that?  How about something soft like cotton?  What am I going to do, sell your streets?  Gold is valueless up here.  It's a fucking mineral.  How about uranium?  Fucking silly.  And it's so bright up there, Jimmy,  and the gold that's going to reflect off the gold.  You're not going to be able to sleep.  You're not going to be able to see anything.  You're going to get headaches all the time.  I had my LASIK surgery.  I'm going to always have that fucking little, 
[03:08:00]  that little circle around the lights.  The little star blight thingy that you get.  So it's people who talk about God all the time  and how he's just doing the,  I'm not saying it's wrong to believe in God  because I think I do.  I just don't know where I'm at with it.  Especially with some type of God.  Especially with the kids  that haven't even done anything yet.  Whatever it is.  To piss anybody off,  all of a sudden you give him it to them.  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck is that?  Or a fucking...  That really bothers me.  It's a freak of nature.  It's all it is.  It's just a nature thing  and they have to explain it 
[03:08:30]  but they can't...  His work works in mysterious ways  meaning using God  is sometimes convenient for me.  It's an easy excuse.  How about this mystery?  Why does he allow a fucking priest  to touch kids  and continue,  you know,  with the God thing?  In his name.  In his name.  Can you imagine  a bunch of people walking around going...  How about he starts there?  I work for Opie  and they were fingering kids.  You probably go,  hey, put you in my name.  I would have to say...  I would have to fire that person.  You'd have to fucking take legal action.  Because he works in mysterious ways. 
[03:09:00]  He just allows them to continue.  And these dummies,  these dummies still go to church  and meanwhile,  I go, hey, look,  I know that you're the guys  that were not only doing this to kids  but shipping them around  and hiding them  so they could fuck other people's kids.  Sure.  But I still would like you  to be the middle man  while I talk to God.  I guess it's like  you're like Pauly in Goodfellas  and you don't talk to anybody directly  except for the guy  with no zipper  who's got a fucking heart on  for an eight-year-old.  Is that Animal House guy?  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  No.  That's Boone from Animal House, right?  Are you serious?  It looks like him.  Wow.  He's on local TV  and he's got to be...  Oh my God.  How old is he?  I don't know.  Apparently he shops at  bignoses.com.  Is that him?  Eesh.  Peter Rieger?  Was he...  It looks like him.  It's not an orgy.  It's a toga party.  That guy.  Is that really him?  It looks like him.  Holy shit.  Anybody?  Is that his name? 
[03:10:00]  Is that from...  It looks like him.  Oh my God.  He was the one that was with...  How old are we?  You know who's had a great career  out of Animal House?  D-Day.  Like he's in every fucking thing.  The guy that rode the motorcycle.  Up the stairs.  That look.  They're showing the clip.  It is him.  Oh my God.  They just showed the Animal House clip.  Well, for an actor,  having a face to go with your name  is crucial.  Oh my God.  He was a kid.  So Animal House was his big success 
[03:10:30]  and I'd been working for...  Let's see.  That was 77.  About six years.  Which is relatively quick.  And, you know,  you get lucky when these things succeed.  Thirty-five years ago?  It made history, though.  Well, let's put it this way.  I've raised a lot of generations  of young people who went to college.  That's how we view college.  That's like a training film.  College was a real disappointment,  actually, compared to this stuff.  Yeah, well, we were trying to set a high bar.  That was the worst.  You know, you were both having an actor  to put it this stuff.  You know, what should people 
[03:11:00]  enjoy more?  Well, it's more directing than producing.  But I'd say...  What happens?  There is no God.  Yeah, why would God then do this to you?  Make you old.  Oh, wow.  I guess God's thinking of Peter Riegert.  That's what he's thinking of.  It's very...  Getting back to...  It's just very confusing.  You just have to rot away.  If God's listening,  how about you start with the priests?  How about you get rid of those?  Yeah, by the way...  Let's start there.  If you're going to do earthquakes,  how about that? 
[03:11:30]  A fucking earthquake occurred  and miraculously,  only a bunch of convicted pedophile priests  were killed and fell into a ditch.  That would be very hard to do.  And the weird thing with the priests,  they're not like diddling non-believers.  No.  You got little kids that are like,  hey, I kind of like this church thing.  I'm going to spend a little more time here.  Yeah, yeah.  God.  I'm going to really commit myself to this.  Uh-oh.  Right.  I think I'm being touched.  Right.  How about you start there?  If you want to allow the priests  to continue diddling,  then how about they diddle  the ones that don't believe?  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Diddle the non-believers.  We'll start there.  We'll start off slow  with the God thing.  I think it's something...  Good points, Jimmy.  Good points.  Science will eventually explain  what God is.  And it may, again,  it may be another being  or it may...  I don't know.  I just don't fucking...  After watching something  on the Big Bang...  Could it be just  the ultimate scientist?  I don't know.  Why not?  Like an experiment?  Why not?  Like we've developed  to a point somewhere else  that we have figured out  mortality and all that  and now we're at a lower level.  But they have figured out  how to take our souls 
[03:12:30]  after we're gone  because it's a big experiment  and then we go back  to that place.  That's possible.  I've thought of that too.  Why not?  I've actually mentioned  that many times on dates.  Do you think that  where we are in our development  is where the universe is?  Exactly.  Why can't it be  way more advanced than us?  Yeah.  Why not?  Yeah.  You think they'll figure out  how to live forever eventually?  I think they'll figure out  how to live for a few hundred years.  Easy.  Forever.  That's not ever, obviously,  but I think the lifespan 
[03:13:00]  could certainly double easily.  In what kind of time frame?  Don't forget with...  I don't know, to be honest.  I don't know,  but they're starting to figure out  how to fucking grow organs and shit.  With stem...  Exactly.  My organ grows.  See?  At all the wrong times, though.  No.  That's supposed to be  when you're watching  Little Miss Sunshine.  See, you went without an organ.  I was thinking his liver.  We had him on two fronts.  We had him on two fronts. 
[03:13:30]  My liver.  Yeah.  Have you noticed the liver  popping out of the side  of your body yet?  No, it's pretty good.  All right, good.  Actually, I'm pretty symmetrical.  Can we poke you?  No.  See if anything hurts?  No one's poking me.  My liver.  Ant's liver's poking me.  They always stop him  because they think  he's stealing a bowling ball.  They're like,  no, you don't understand.  I enjoy tipping a few back.  I'm not stealing an African mango.  Oh, shit.  You know what's scary  about that guy from Animal House?  He did look older. 
[03:14:00]  I always thought  that he looked too old for college.  Yeah, well, they all do.  Boom, right?  Pretty much, yeah.  Boom.  So let's say  he's only in his 60s.  30, he'd be 63.  63, 64?  63, 64.  Do we have  IMBD on this guy?  IMBD?  Yes.  Oh, you got it?  When was he born there, Danny?  47.  So that's 53, 64.  Yeah, 64.  Okay.  So he was about,  he was 30  when they filmed that movie.  Because I always thought  that was weird.  He just didn't look like 
[03:14:30]  he was in.  Do that to our pledges?  Only we could do that  to our pledges.  They all looked old, actually.  Yeah, they did.  They all looked like  they were really old.  Belushi didn't look like  he was a college-aged kid.  Well, he was supposed  to be there for seven years.  That's true.  You're right about that.  I forgot about the storyline.  He died.  Well, yeah.  Yes.  Yes, Jimmy, he did.  After that thing.  Continental Divide,  I think, was his last movie.  Yeah, I think that was.  Or was it Neighbors?  I think Continental Divide, right? 
[03:15:00]  Boy, did Dan Aykroyd get fat.  Holy shit, yeah.  God, it never even looked like  he had a weight problem.  Oh, Neighbors?  Neighbors?  You died after Neighbors?  Yeah, what do I know?  The Continental Divide.  He made a lot of shitty movies  after that animal house.  1941 made me laugh.  This funny, Frank McRae  was that black actor  who I loved.  Yeah, yeah.  And now when he goes,  hey, get in the point  when the fucking  the white guy got like  black on him  and Frank McRae's like,  get in the back of the tank.  You know that line?  He was Eddie Murphy's boss 
[03:15:30]  in 48 Hours.  Right, right.  Oh, really?  If that little piece of shit  ever spent a legal day  in his life,  it'll be a miracle.  Frank McRae made me fucking laugh.  Nigga, that's right.  I said nigga.  It's hysterical.  He was in used cars too?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, just get in  the motherfucking car.  I don't want to look.  He's like,  you look inside,  it's all roomy, nice.  I don't want to look at it.  Oh, just get in  the motherfucking car.  And he shoves  the little old white guy  in the car.  Frank McRae was fucking hilarious. 
[03:16:00]  He's trying to sell a car  and he's a mechanic.  He's not ready  to be selling a car.  Why didn't he ever  become a big star?  I don't know, man.  A big star.  He was in a,  what was he?  Can we look him up?  M-C-R-A-E,  I think his name was.  Frank McRae always  made me laugh though.  I don't even know  if he's still alive.  He was always like  one of those supporting.  Yeah, he was in  a lot of those movies too.  Characters, yeah.  But used cars, 1941,  40 hours.  I thought I saw used cars  because of you.  Did you enjoy it?  Yeah, absolutely.  There's some funny lines  in that, right?  Absolutely, I liked it.  I like Kurt Russell, 
[03:16:30]  young Kurt Russell.  Kurt Russell was great.  Fucking Jack Warden.  The story's absolutely ludicrous,  but who cares?  It's just funny.  Most of the great comedies,  they're storylines.  Yeah.  Was he in,  oh, it was 2006.  He's alive, right?  Still alive.  He's got to be  really old now, huh?  No, he's not doing  a lot of great movies,  but I love when he would  get mad and yell.  Oh, he was great.  I don't know what's  looking at his IMDb.  Another 48 hours  or queues in that. 
[03:17:00]  Jimmy, what do we got?  You got any plugs today?  Not this week,  but tomorrow night,  Leno, Wednesday,  Chelsea Handler.  And then a week  from this weekend,  I'll be at the Irvine Improv  for the first time ever.  Wow.  And Despicable  was number two  on Billboard.  I saw that.  For comedy.  I'm sure it won't last.  I saw you tweet that shit.  I'm sure it won't last,  but as of right now,  it's doing very well.  So we'll see  how long that lasts for.  I hope I do well.  I don't want to hate  the bomb.  Did you have  a bignoses.com? 
[03:17:30]  I did.  Oh, okay.  It was terrible.  Did I have a bignoses?  Well, this guy's like,  let me guess,  you guys magically  didn't hear  Jimmy's bignoses.com bomb.  I honestly didn't.  It was a horrible bomb.  Yeah, I didn't hear it.  I was glad.  I think I even went,  eek.  Hold on a second.  Can you find that  really fast?  The Grim Reaper  is tapping me.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Jimmy has another  big announcement tonight.  What?  His Boneyard show  moves to 10 p.m. tonight.  Tonight, from now on,  it's 10 o'clock  because Ron and Fez  are on 11. 
[03:18:00]  I don't want to compete  with Ron and Fez.  Who would?  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Wait, they moved it down?  No, 10 p.m.  Where was it?  11 a.m.  It was right after  we first started  going to 11.  We were going to 11  so they figured,  hey, we'll just go over there.  But it's XM53 Series 19  from 10 to 11  and I play my own music  and it's fun, man.  I love doing it.  I'll be on tonight  at 10 o'clock.  It's fun?  Thanks, Kenny.  Good for you.  I thought Kenny  had bad news as usual.  Death, murder, rape. 
[03:18:30]  Right back.  Hey, how are you?  Cancer, suicide,  brain, tumor, stroke.  I'm really tired.  Sleep apnea.  Fucking, um,  I just got to get home  because I got to fly.  Amelia Earhart,  flight 800, 9-11.  Okay.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  I do love doing radio.  Eric Bogosian. 
[03:19:00]  Fucking God.  He is just the harbinger  of doom, gloom, and death.  Oh, my fucking God.  A horrible man.  He actually owns  the original fucking  raven outfit  from The Omen.  I like to sit on a fence post  when bad things  are about to happen.  It's fucking horrible.  You know,  whenever you mention hockey,  you're like,  you know,  the fucking Islanders,  oh, Damien,  The Omen 2.  There's a great hockey scene.  Yeah, it's in the ice. 
[03:19:30]  Under the ice, yeah.  Just loves it.  Scary.  Yeah.  All right.  So no Jimmy tomorrow  or Wednesday.  No, but I'm back  for almost for good  after that.  Thursday.  We'll see Jimmy  on Thursday.  Okay, someone should  exactly put Kenny's face  under Damien's hat.  We got the bomb, Jimmy.  I got to hear this.  Okay, yeah.  He's on local TV  and he's got to be.  Oh, my God.  How old is he?  I don't know.  Apparently he shops  at bignoses.com.  Is that him?  Yeah.  See, it's way better 
[03:20:00]  when no one hears it.  And Jimmy just goes,  eee.  Shit, that's great.  It's way better  than when no one hears it.  Holy fucking mackerel.  One more time.  One more time.  He's on local TV  and he's got to be.  Oh, my God.  How old is he?  I don't know.  Apparently he shops  at bignoses.com.  Is that him?  Eee.  I love it. 
[03:20:30]  That's beautiful.  Fucking, that was  a monumental bomb.  Pilot to bombardier.  Holy shit.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony Show.  The virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
