<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – engaging in their signature self-deprecating and often vulgar introductions, referencing past controversies.  The Super Bowl dominated the early conversation, with scathing critiques of the commercials deemed unfunny, overly politically correct, and predictable.  Specific commercials were dissected with explicit commentary, targeting an interracial Pepsi ad, a Doritos ad hinting at same-sex acts, and generally lamenting the lack of originality.  Christina Aguilera's flawed National Anthem performance and the ensuing media frenzy were also discussed. Listener calls followed, offering varied opinions on the commercials, the game itself, and Brett Favre's reaction to the Packers' win. Anthony recounted a post-Super Bowl show with Jim Norton and Bob Kelly that involved graphic descriptions of bodily functions.  The Black Eyed Peas' halftime performance was criticized for poor sound quality, followed by a segment on the Puppy Bowl, deemed "adorable" but too long. A listener's anecdote about watching "The Towering Inferno" instead of the Super Bowl pre-game show sparked a lengthy discussion of the film.

The discussion then shifted to A-Rod and Cameron Diaz, with suggestive commentary on A-Rod being fed popcorn by Diaz. A brief mention of a Kim Kardashian commercial led to a longer discussion of Robert Kardashian's reaction to the O.J. Simpson verdict, using a still image from the broadcast.  The hosts announced upcoming guests: Kevin Smith, Piers Morgan, and Brooklyn Decker, with humorous, sometimes crude, remarks about each.  Meg Ryan's plastic surgery and a comparison of Brooklyn Decker's breasts to "round orb tits" were also part of the banter.

A subsequent segment began with criticism of celebrity cosmetic surgeries, focusing on Kim Richards and Melanie Griffith's "duck lips," speculating on the origin of the trend.  The conversation pivoted to Mark Sanchez and a rumored relationship with a 17-year-old, leading to a discussion of statutory rape laws.  The upcoming guests – Kevin Smith, Piers Morgan, and Brooklyn Decker – were mentioned again, with further vulgar comments about Decker's potential body odor.  The discussion returned to Mark Sanchez's potential indiscretions, followed by a discussion of Steve Phillips' scandal with an intern, including descriptions of the intern's appearance. The death of Gary Moore was announced, followed by a discussion of his career with Thin Lizzy and his solo work.  Crude jokes about Justin Bieber's potential sexual encounters with underage girls and speculation on his future were included, along with sexually suggestive comments about other celebrities and their fans.  The hosts discussed several TV shows, including *iCarly*, *My Life as Liz*, and the cancellation of *Skins*, often with suggestive remarks about the actresses' ages and appearances.  They also mentioned Jimmy Swaggart's scandal and *A Current Affair*. Kevin Smith joined the show in studio towards the end of this segment, discussing his weight loss and upcoming film premiere at Radio City Music Hall.  Piers Morgan's background and upcoming appearance were also briefly discussed.

Another segment started with derogatory comments about Alex Rodriguez's baseball contract, transitioning to a caller's birthday and a discussion of one host's past shirts with offensive imagery, including one depicting an orgy.  This led to a lengthy reminiscence about Disneyland, covering ticket systems, rides (Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean), animatronics, and employee deaths, including a mention of Club 22. The conversation then shifted to movie trailers for *Captain America*, *Thor*, and *Super 8*, including critiques of Kenneth Branagh and J.J. Abrams' lens flare.  The *Star Trek* reboot and the upcoming *Spider-Man* reboot were discussed, touching upon rights issues. Kevin Smith, already in studio, promoted his *Red State* tour and Radio City Music Hall screening.  The conversation included discussions of Kevin Smith's personal life,  *Catfish*, and disparaging comments about Jennifer Aniston's hygiene.  The high divorce rate among Oscar-winning actresses was discussed using offensive language.  Piers Morgan's upcoming appearance was mentioned, with his interview with Kevin Smith being rescheduled.  The final portion covered the Egyptian protests, using internet images, including one of a man with a bread helmet.  The hockey goalie DiPietro's facial injury from a fight with a penguin mascot was compared to Billy Smith. Piers Morgan joined briefly near the end, discussing his show and recent interviews. Brooklyn Decker was also mentioned as a scheduled guest.

A segment featuring an interview with Piers Morgan began with a discussion of changing news landscapes, comparing Walter Cronkite to modern anchors like Anderson Cooper.  Morgan discussed the impact of the internet on news credibility and a frustrating experience with *Entertainment Weekly*. His meticulous interview preparation was contrasted with Larry King's style, including anecdotes about circumventing publicists' restrictions by interviewing George Clooney's father. He emphasized direct questioning and respect, even on sensitive topics, mentioning interviews with Oprah Winfrey and Tony Blair.  The challenges of interviewing, including controversial topics and publicists' control, were discussed, touching upon Oprah Winfrey's lesbian rumors and Morgan's upcoming interview with Gayle King.  His *America's Got Talent* experience, critiques of Christina Aguilera's Super Bowl performance and Chips Cooney, were mentioned.  Airport security, Islamic extremism, and the need for nuanced approaches were discussed, drawing parallels between the IRA and the Middle East. China's economic rise was also mentioned. Brooklyn Decker, starring in Morgan's film *Just Go With It*, joined briefly, discussing her modeling career, filming love scenes with Adam Sandler, and her husband's reaction.  Morgan concluded with his perspective on media biases and CNN's position, plugging his own show.

The final segment included an interview with Brooklyn Decker, promoting her movie.  The conversation began with a suggestive description of a beach scene, leading to banter about sand and exfoliation.  Piers Morgan's CNN experiences, opinions on news, and views on the Egyptian revolution were discussed.  Morgan shared anecdotes about Madonna and Heather Mills McCartney, whom he jokingly banned from his show.  Decker shared her political thoughts and news consumption habits, revealing her name wasn't inspired by Brooklyn.  They discussed the Middle East, China's internet censorship, and information access for today's youth. The segment concluded with movie promotion and a plug for a future Piers Morgan event, ending with a humorous advertisement for a fictional Andy Rooney juicing instructional video.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go, here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  When you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything I do is cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life. 
[00:01:00]  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  And with that, we say good morning.  Hi, everybody.  How's everybody doing?  Are we talking to anybody right now, you think?  Yeah, a few people actually made it into work, I think. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  For the most part, though.  Well, not made it into work.  Getting up for work.  Yeah.  I think a lot of people take Monday off after the Super Bowl, I'm thinking.  I think it should be a national holiday.  It really should.  It just gets crazy.  Everybody stays up a little too late, you know.  Wow.  What a great idea.  The Monday after the Super Bowl should be just a national holiday.  We all hang out and celebrate the fact that we got a new Super Bowl champion.  Right.  That's a good excuse.  Then we all spend half the day in the bowl trying to get rid of cheese. 
[00:02:00]  Cheese.  How much cheese was eaten?  And I'm not just saying cheese because the Packers won the dumb Super Bowl.  Yeah.  I'm not being that hacky.  Well, I...  In general, people eat cheese and lots of it.  I actually had to get up out of a seat because I was too close to the cheese dip.  Really?  And with the chips.  You know those chips that are shaped like the little bowl?  Oh, right, right.  So you could just...  The scoops.  The scoops, yeah.  Well, they're called scoops.  You could just scoop up a shot of cheese in these things and eat them. 
[00:02:30]  And it's fantastic.  Oh, God.  So I literally, I had two or three of them, and I was like, I got to get up and walk away  from the cheese.  You were done.  Done with the cheese.  It was a pretty good TV show.  Yeah.  I didn't care if the Packers or the Steelers won, so it makes it a little more difficult  to watch the game, but...  But it was a good game, so...  It was a really, really good game. 
[00:03:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah, so it kind of balanced out the fact that you really didn't care who the hell won.  Right.  I guess someone has to say it, and we're the show to do it.  Enough with the Super Bowl commercials.  That went away years ago.  There's nothing special about Super Bowl commercials.  But every year, they try to really make it this big thing.  And I don't know what year we lost the Super Bowl commercial, but it's been many years  now.  Yeah, it's been years that they're no better or even worse than regular commercials that  are on every day of the week. 
[00:03:30]  I don't know why they deem them so special.  A couple of them stand out a little bit, but they're just commercials at this point.  I mean, I remember a time where, maybe because we're at with technology, you know, they can't  hold back the commercials anymore.  There was a time, all of a sudden, it hit that screen and you, or your TV, excuse me,  and you'd sit there like, holy shit, that was awesome.  Yeah.  But now, they actually release the commercials ahead of time.  It's all over Facebook. 
[00:04:00]  It's all over Twitter.  It's all over the internet in general.  That it's, there's no real surprises.  And then, you really, you put it up against a regular day of commercials and they're not  that much more special.  Yeah, if you slipped any one of those commercials in during any TV show you were watching, you  wouldn't be like, wow, that one was special.  No, not really.  They're the same fucking shit commercials.  Yeah.  I don't know.  None stand out.  Maybe one.  Maybe that Pepsi Max one that annoyed me. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, because the black chick got to throw the can at the white girl.  Yeah, that and, you know, the smiling, the interracial smiling between each other.  Yeah, because that's what happens in real life.  And I think a million, literally a million people tweeted, imagine if it was the white  girl throwing the can at the black girl.  Yeah, there's a white couple sitting on the bench and then the white guy looks at the black  girl, the black girl looks at the white guy, they smile at each other.  Then the white chick throws a can and hits the black chick in the head and knocks her 
[00:05:00]  out.  I think we'd be seeing apologies today.  That would be a major problem.  Yeah, yeah.  The other one, which would be a major problem, and it just made me uncomfortable because I think  their message was, if you eat Doritos, you might turn gay.  You might, oh, the guy.  You might turn gay.  Yeah.  The guy licking the black guy's fingers?  Yeah, that was a little.  Or the black guy's finger?  And it goes with what you just said.  Imagine if it was a black guy licking a white guy's finger.  I saw it as a very subservient thing. 
[00:05:30]  Again, white men just looking like buffoons and.  Subservient and it was gay.  It was.  It was a bit gay.  Because then he ripped the other guy's pants off.  And had a sniff his.  And was sniffing his Dorito pants.  I don't know, man.  Wasn't that one with a tranny, too?  Like the guy dressed up as a chick and.  No, that was the halftime show at Fergie.  Oh, Foyote.  Flaggy, flaggy.  I like Fergie.  But no one liked the black eyed peas.  Which one was the commercial with the tranny? 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  At the beginning, there was a guy and he's like looking at shit and he looks at shoes and  and then he's just dressed like a chick and he's talking.  That's the thing about these commercials, too.  I couldn't tell you what 99% of them were.  No.  I mean, Doritos, you could see because it's a Dorito bag.  But a lot of the car commercials, I was like, was that for an Audi or a Mercedes?  I think they were trying to make a Hyundai look cool at one point.  Really?  It's still a Hyundai, right?  Good luck there.  It's still a fucking whatever car.  Yeah, here's the Doritos commercial. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, where he's like, he starts licking the guys.  That was just really uncomfortable.  Was that funny?  No, it was.  Did people find that funny or just really uncomfortable?  It was uncomfortable.  Yeah, and then he wipes it on his pants and then he has to rip his pants off and smell  his pants.  And the guy starts sniffing the other guy's pants.  I don't know.  So, I mean, well, here we are.  I mean, there's a few standouts, but for other reasons.  For other reasons, yeah.  Not because the commercials were so great.  It's like, oh, that was funny.  Like people are saying the little dog, like running and knocking down the screen door 
[00:07:00]  to get at the Dorito.  Why was that a good commercial?  It was a dumb, stupid commercial.  It was just a regular commercial.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, there's the black chick slamming the white chick in the head with a Pepsi Max can.  What is Pepsi Max?  I don't even know.  I saw 10 commercials for it.  I still don't know what it is.  It's racist is what it is.  What is it, though?  I don't know.  It's like, you know.  Is it juiced up, uh, soda?  Maximum flavor and, uh, no calories. 
[00:07:30]  Does it have a little more caffeine or something in it?  I don't know.  And then this jogger sits down.  Look, she smiles.  Honey, honey!  And then knocks on the head with the can.  Yeah, that would happen in reverse.  Yeah.  At least they run away.  That would be welcome.  Yeah, that would not.  Nah.  That would not.  Of course not.  By the way.  Ugh.  Yeah.  That, but, uh, the game itself was really good.  I like nice close game. 
[00:08:00]  Right up to the end.  It was anybody's game.  Anybody's game.  Sure was.  It was just amazing.  An amazing finish.  What?  That the Packers won, I guess, 31-25.  Yeah.  Uh, Aaron Rodgers gets the MVP.  Ah.  You think Brett Favre was on a suicide watch last night?  Uh, I was snapping pictures of his little tiny penis with the wacky head on it.  Officially, Green Bay has completely forgotten about Brett Favre.  That's it.  You got a new quarterback, and he's the MVP of the Super Bowl.  No need.  Not good.  To remember Brett Favre. 
[00:08:30]  Uh, first title in 14 years for the Packers.  Here's your stats on this thing.  And that's their, uh, fourth Super Bowl.  And there's going to be a big parade at Disney World today, so.  Disney World?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  I guess that's the thing to do.  There's like, as Disney, don't they have parades every day?  Yeah, they do.  They do.  They do.  They do.  They do.  They do.  They do.  They do.  All kinds of fun parades.  The thing is, I guess, what, is there no real place in Wisconsin to have a parade? 
[00:09:00]  No, they have to go home and have that parade, too.  That one's usually a little later, isn't it?  I don't know.  It's like, usually that's a little later, a couple days later.  When a New York team wins, they don't go to Orlando for a parade.  I think it's a new thing.  They go there because it's a big sponsor, and then they go home for a big parade, too, right?  Oh, is that it?  That's what I'm thinking.  It's new if you want to, like, say, 25 years.  Oh, really?  They've been doing it?  What a dummy.  Sorry.  Every year they say, what are you going to do?  I'm going to Disney World.  I thought it's the one guy.  But, yeah, it's usually the one guy. 
[00:09:30]  They do a whole, like, parade.  I don't know if the entire team goes down, but Aaron Rodgers is definitely going to be  there, and they do it every year.  All right, but I don't think the whole team goes.  It's the one guy.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to Disney World.  Yeah, we know that, Travis.  Yeah.  But it's a parade for the one guy.  Possibly.  Because they only pay the one guy the money to say that after the big win.  The big win.  But, like, where do they do it in?  At Disney?  Wisconsin.  Oh, I don't know.  Probably, I don't know.  Green Bay.  Like, it doesn't seem like they could have a Canyon of Heroes. 
[00:10:00]  Main Street.  Do they have a Canyon of Heroes?  Do they have a...  Green Bay, Main Street.  A little rut of cool guys.  Yeah, but when the Devils won the Stanley Cup, they just had a parade in the parking lot  at the Meadowlands.  So it doesn't really matter.  It's just, you just need to get the fans together to celebrate a little bit.  Yeah.  They'll find a place.  Let's say hi to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Hey there, Paul.  Morning.  Hey, how much do you think that Volkswagen commercial cost where the little Darth Vader,  where they used him and the music?  You know they had to pay George Lucas plus the ad time. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I guess that was supposed to be a really cool commercial.  Did you see the little Darth Vader thing?  Didn't even see it.  Didn't even see it.  Well, that's why George Lucas created most Star Wars characters.  Because he wanted to market them and sell shit with them.  Yeah.  This fucking stinks.  Every time I see a George Lucas character in a commercial, that's exactly what they're  good for.  Just advertising.  I guess what?  Love you, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, Paul.  Did you like the Darth Vader commercial?  I thought it was pretty cool.  I have kids, so you know. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  And I like Star Wars, so it was pretty good.  All right.  So that was a win-win for you.  Yeah, certainly.  Let me go to Andy in PA.  Andy.  Andy.  Hey.  Good morning, bu-bu-bu-boy.  Morning.  Trying to wake up here.  What's up?  Oh, you know what?  Yeah.  Well, first of all, I've been awake since 3 a.m.  So, you know, I didn't really give much of a shit to watch the Super Bowl.  All I cared about was that the Steelers lost, and it's kind of strange being from Western  PA because, you know, I've got too many friends who are cocky Steelers fans. 
[00:11:30]  I think it's good that, you know, there's silence and everything.  But what I really called about was the – I raised a question earlier about the commercials.  When did that whole thing go sour?  And I have to say it was probably in the mid-'90s when the dot-com bubble popped.  It just seems like, you know, they were putting a lot of stuff out for all the websites and  everything else, and then all of a sudden it just kind of fell apart, and so did the commercials. 
[00:12:00]  All the money was gone.  And not only that, fucking PC, that's the other problem.  Well, that's true, yeah.  Kind of the PC thing really did fuck it up.  When people had to start pulling commercials for homophobia, and they had to start apologizing  for dumb commercials, that's kind of when it took a shit.  Yeah, and now it's going the other way, which is absolutely ridiculous.  So, you know, I mean, what are you going to do?  I don't even care.  Commercial time was like time to grab beer. 
[00:12:30]  Grab beer and more cheese.  That's what it was.  Like, why fucking watch that when you could take that good time to grab yourself a beer?  Although I'll say that that Cowboys vs. Aliens looks like it's going to be an amazing movie.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I saw the trailer for that.  Holy shit, does that look good.  It is.  Yeah.  Cowboys vs. Aliens.  Is that the name of the movie?  Cowboys and Aliens in it.  How could you go wrong?  How could you lose?  Let's go to Charlie in Staten Island. 
[00:13:00]  Charlie.  Good morning.  I think the show started off great with Christina Aguilera.  I think she did a great rendition of the national anthem.  Wow.  Did she blow it, huh?  Her own rendition?  What did she do?  She said like...  Well, we got it right here for everybody.  Oh, the faux pas.  A lot of people have...  Oh, wow.  We're getting tones on here.  A lot of people have fucked up the national anthem, though, over the years.  Well, you've said that it's a very hard song to sing in general.  Hard song to sing.  It's a lot of pressure, too. 
[00:13:30]  I mean, although she's a pro.  Right.  She should be able to handle the pressure.  But she said she got caught up in the moment, I guess.  Really?  Yeah.  But she wanted that moment.  Yeah.  Everyone that sings that, especially at the Super Bowl, they want that moment, right?  Write it on your hand.  Maybe if you weren't paying so much attention to your vocal acrobatics.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Just hold a piece of paper.  Yeah, read it.  People are afraid of being embarrassed at holding paper.  Just fucking hold a piece of paper.  I wonder if you could get one of those teleprops. 
[00:14:00]  Teleprop.  Teleprops.  That's a guy.  Just teleprompting.  Prompt.  Teleprompt.  Of course.  It's prompting.  It's prompting.  Here she is fucking up the National Anthem.  Or was it the Star Spangled Banner?  National Anthem, right?  Yeah, National Anthem.  The Glee Girl sang the Star Spangled Banner.  She sang a...  What was that?  America the Beautiful.  Oh, Beautiful America.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here's Christine Aguilar.  Through the perilous fight 
[00:14:30]  What so proudly we watched  At the twilight's last gleaming  What happened to the ramparts?  What happened there?  Where'd the ramparts go?  What happened there?  Just trying to have a Whitney Houston fucking moment.  That's it.  And fucked it up.  Good.  Good.  Stupid.  She released some kind of statement.  What happened to Hoar the Rampart?  Oh, we are.  Hoar the Ramparts.  We watched.  Oh, E.  They're so gallantly streaming. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, well, she had a statement  That she loves America  And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, wow.  The spirit of the song was there for everybody.  And then communist.  But then she said,  Who cares?  It's funny that she had to release a statement.  She muffed it.  It's good when that happens.  It gives us something to talk about, right?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mark in Springfield.  Mark.  Hey, how you guys doing? 
[00:15:30]  Pretty good, Mark.  First of all, Christina Aguilar can suck it for messing that up.  But I wanted to comment on that Pepsi commercial.  If that was the reverse where the white girl was throwing the can and hitting the can,  that would have been a racial riot and Pepsi would have had to pull the commercial.  I give you apologies to everyone in their freaking mouth.  Fox probably wouldn't have taken it if it was reversed.  They probably would have found a reason to reject it.  Absolutely.  It would have been a hate crime.  Absolutely, absolutely.  And secondly, I just wanted to comment on Anthony's Live from the Compound with Jimmy and Bob Kelly. 
[00:16:00]  Did you enjoy it?  I know, it was fun.  The little post-game we did.  Yeah.  We did a little post-game show for about, I don't know, about an hour.  We just babbled about it.  We started out talking about the Super Bowl and somehow got to the point of,  Have you tried to suck your own dick?  And Bobby had a great story of how he almost broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.  And what cum tastes like. 
[00:16:30]  It just, I don't know.  And we actually got a great moment where Jimmy showed Bobby a picture of a big lump of shit  in the toilet that Jimmy had taken.  And Bobby started dry heaving and I thought he was going to puke in my basement.  So he was scrambling to find a box or anything he could throw up.  Bob had cut a gasser and it stunk.  And then Bobby farted and completely stunk the whole fucking studio up.  So I just showed him a picture of shit.  He didn't like that so much.  He says,  Keith, get him a box. 
[00:17:00]  They handed him an electronics box to vomit in.  Yeah.  He said to vomit.  He's great.  Poor Bobby.  Have a great week punching out, guys.  All right, man.  You too.  Bye-bye.  Is Favre still part of the team when he get a ring?  No, Brett Favre isn't part of the Packers.  How is that possible?  Hey, Bill, what's going on with you?  You all right?  He'll get nothing unlike it.  Well, I thought he didn't retire until the end of the season.  I just was wondering, just because he's injured. 
[00:17:30]  He was on the Vikings this year.  Yeah, he was on the Vikings.  Oh, that's right.  I'm sorry.  Okay, all right.  Does he get a ring?  Yeah, everybody gets him.  All right, good.  All the NFL gets him.  Everyone's a winner.  Black Eyed Peas had probably one of the worst halftimes ever.  You didn't like the people in the Tron suits?  Well, visually, it looked all right.  The problem was someone fucked up the sound really bad.  Yeah, the Black Eyed Peas.  Well, they fucked it up by not having a bunch of other tracks. 
[00:18:00]  They should have been singing over something.  It was so thin.  Yeah, it really was.  And then everyone's speakers in the world were crackling because the sound guy there fucked  up something.  Oh, was that what the problem was?  Oh, you must have had a party going on so you didn't hear it.  Yeah, no, I went back to the Puppy Bowl.  You didn't hear the crackling of the speakers?  So everyone's looking at their own speakers going, fuck, I need new speakers.  But it turned out they fucked up.  I was reading some of the tweets about the speakers, and I guess that's what the problem  was.  Yeah.  But no, I switched channels and went to the Puppy Bowl. 
[00:18:30]  It's just adorable.  Was it great?  Oh, my God.  The cutest little puppies running around a little football field, right?  And then they pick up these stuffed footballs, and they go, and then they try to run it  in for a touchdown.  And a lot of the little puppies are tackling them, and it's just adorable.  And they had a little kitten halftime show where they get these little mechanical cat toys,  and the little kittens are just, like, batting them around.  It's adorable. 
[00:19:00]  Look, look at the Puppy Bowl.  Look.  Look, they're all in little, uh, come on, get the ball.  Get the ball.  And they'd always stop, like, at the one-yard line, the dumb dogs, and then they lay down.  Okay, terrific.  They're ready to go in for a touchdown, and then they lay down.  But it didn't matter because they're adorable.  I love the puppies.  That sounds like it would be fun for maybe 30 seconds.  It was.  How long did it go on for?  About 40 seconds, and it was about 10 seconds too long. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, really?  It was quick?  No, no.  That's how long I was able to last through it.  I thought they were adorable, and then I'm like, all right, what happens here?  Right, right, right.  These dumb dogs, I have no clue.  I like the fact, too, they put a water bowl in right in the middle of the field,  and the little dogs are, like, scampering to chase each other,  and they'll just fall in the water bowl and get all wet.  Fucking, this is not a real game.  Here's, uh, just a taste of the black-eyed peas.  This should have been a good halftime show.  They have a lot of hits, these guys. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  But it just fell completely flat.  Live on it, too.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Tonight's the night. Hey, let's live it up.  I got my money. Hey, let's spin it up.  Go out and smash. 
[00:20:30]  Like, oh my God.  Jump out that sofa.  Let's get, get, oh.  Yeah, that's sad.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Get down and go out and just lose it up.  I feel stressed out.  I won't let it go.  I thought 40 was good.  Yeah.  We're losing our control.  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.  Fill up my cup.  Might as well talk.  Look at it dancing.  Just take it off.  Let's make the town. 
[00:21:00]  We'll shut it down.  Let's burn the roof.  Hey.  I got a feeling.  That's the night.  Really just flat, huh?  Uh, yeah.  I don't even know, but I would assume they're not that great live.  Yeah, that's that kind of music that really needs to be overproduced and everything.  Yeah.  I'll tell you the truth.  Fergie's voice is good.  Well, she did, uh, Sweet Child, right?  Oh, that was great.  Slash.  Watching Slash come out with his disco ball fucking hat.  He almost saved it.  Almost? 
[00:21:30]  Almost.  He almost saved the halftime show.  Yeah, he needed to be on the stage a little longer.  He kind of looked silly.  Put your hands in the air.  Well, I am.  Drop the beat now.  Go, go.  Oh, beat, beat, beat.  How great is that riff?  Every fucking time, man.  That riff was.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Slash. 
[00:22:00]  How many times has he played that riff?  How many times do you think he played that fucking riff, man?  He's got to make believe he loves playing it.  Yeah, here it is, man.  He probably loves it because it's made him millions of dollars.  Every time he plays it, he just has to think of the cash because he must be so sick of playing that fucking riff.  25 years.  Slash is actually staring there with less of a princess than he had to. 
[00:22:30]  And this is literally written by fucking Baby Axl.  I'm good.  Did she piss herself? 
[00:23:00]  Did she piss herself?  Well, you can't tell if she wore a skirt, so she could probably pee and just run down the light.  You can't really tell, right?  I want to see the piss run into her boots.  I don't know.  It would be wonderful.  Yeah, Axl must have been a little pissed off that he doesn't get the big stage singing Sweet Child. 
[00:23:30]  Nah.  He just can't get his shit together in any shape or form.  That's pretty big, though.  He was, you know, Super Bowl.  That would have been nice.  Got a good audience there.  Maybe Axl doesn't want to do Super Bowl, though.  No?  Who knows what that guy wants to do.  I mean, what was Axl doing last night?  Is that Axl?  Nah.  That's what he looks like?  Axl got so old.  These are actually old.  Holy shit.  Who does he look like?  He does look like somebody.  Maybe like Leif Garrett a little bit. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, Jesus.  No.  Who does he look like?  What an asshole he looks like.  It's like Mickey Rourke and the Wrestler.  Yeah, Mickey Rourke.  Dusty Rhodes.  He went through a phase where he just doesn't look like he used to anymore at all.  Like, you could pass him in the street and not think it's him.  The jungle's full of...  There's a picture of Axl, a fat Axl, and it says, the jungle's full of pies, apparently.  Still makes fans wait for hours.  What a prick. 
[00:24:30]  What a fucking prick.  Let's go to Kevin in New York.  Kevin.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hello.  Hi, buddy.  You're right.  The commercials were pretty gee, but who can not laugh when Roseanne gets smashed?  That was the best commercial there was.  Yeah, it was fun.  Wasn't that...  Yeah, but that...  That was Betty White last year, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just...  It doesn't fucking matter to me, these dumb things.  Watch the game. 
[00:25:00]  Fuck the commercials.  You don't like all the hype?  You don't like the...  I hate the hype.  The four to six hour pregame.  I didn't watch one minute.  It started on ESPN, and they move it over to the Fox.  Didn't watch a minute of pregame.  I was watching...  I was watching Irwin Allen's The Towering Inferno, starring Paul Newman and O.J. Simpson.  Oh, my God.  It was wonderful.  It probably was better than the pregame.  Just watching O.J. knowing that murdering fuck is just...  Like, every second of that, I was just making murder jokes. 
[00:25:30]  Like, he's got to go save someone, and it just slits their throat.  It's like, oh, no, she died from smoke inhalation.  Bleeding from her open wound on her throat.  And it's that typical Irwin Allen thing where they've got to have the character development  as the first half, and then there's always the person that didn't take something seriously  or cut corners to save money or something, and that's what causes the disaster. 
[00:26:00]  And then there's the people that don't want to save people quickly because they think it's  under control.  Right.  And this is everything.  The Poseidon Adventure, the fucking Earthquake, Towering Inferno, all those Irwin Allen things,  same movie.  He had a formula.  He had a formula.  What was the shortcut in The Towering Inferno?  I forgot.  It was fucking...  Wiring.  Yeah, yeah.  The shortcut was the wiring.  The son-in-law of the owner of the building was taking kickbacks, and he didn't use the 
[00:26:30]  coded wire that Paul Newman had said to put in.  Paul Newman was always angry at that.  The character developments work.  They want you to feel something when the people die, but you never do.  You don't care.  And the way the fire started was great.  This fuse box-y thing in a closet flies open and goes...  And this wire just falls on...  Perfectly.  This closet should have been labeled, closet to make a fire. 
[00:27:00]  It had stacks of rags and paper under the fuse box, and then these cans that just said  flammable on them, and every shelf in the closet had aerosol cans and everything.  And it just burst into flames.  They wanted to make sure you knew this closet was dangerous.  There was no doubt that this closet was the worst closet.  I haven't seen that movie in a long time.  When the wire dropped, did it start with a little smoke just to get you going? 
[00:27:30]  It went bzzz, bzzz, and then some sparks.  And then they go to another scene for a little while.  And then...  Right.  You see, like, a little flame happens.  And then the guy there having a party, a big guy...  Why is that guy in fire?  Because he had to be.  But the fire wasn't that bad yet.  No, he opened that door.  Oh, I see.  And you get that going.  A little backdraft.  A little backdraft happened.  And then Paul Newman calls upstairs to the party, because they're having a big grand opening  for the building party.  And he's like, hey, there's a fire down here.  And the guy's like, well, we're up in the 130th floor. 
[00:28:00]  He goes, well, there's a fire on the 80th floor.  It's not my concern.  He goes, you just take care of it.  Meanwhile, it's a blazing fucking inferno.  There's a very scary moment with the elevator.  The outdoor elevator or something.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a scary...  Yeah, because the elevator inside didn't work.  One guy came up in the elevator, and it opened, and he's on fire.  Jesus.  And he just wanders into the party and falls down.  Yep.  And Fred Astaire takes his jacket off and puts it over him. 
[00:28:30]  Fred Astaire was in the movie.  Of course he was.  And we were making jokes that Fred Astaire was just saying, you can't come in here without  a jacket.  He puts it over his burnt body.  Everybody was screaming in horror.  The stuntman has come a long way.  Because in these old movies, when someone's on fire, it's obviously the stuntman.  And he moves in a stuntman type of way to keep...  You know, he knows how to work fire on his body.  Not only that, they're wearing these fire suits that, like...  The guy is supposed to be a guy that's going to a party in a suit.  Right.  He's got a suit and tie on. 
[00:29:00]  And he comes out of the elevator on fire, and he's in what looks to be an 1850s deep  sea diver suit.  Like a sumo wrestling...  Yeah.  He's on fire, and he's walking like a robot.  Yes.  And then he falls down, and it cuts to something else the second he falls down.  Because you know the crew ought to come in and put him out.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he had to fall a certain way.  You're right.  Yeah, he had to fall a certain way.  So they could put the fire out.  They've come a long way with that.  But it was fun to watch a few of the famous actors of the day falling out of windows on 
[00:29:30]  fire, and bursting into flames.  I gotta see that movie, man.  Remember the...  Oh, yeah.  When was that when they put the...  Across to the next building?  The zip line?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They did the zip line.  It was...  It was one of those...  You know, it's an old classic.  Fun to watch.  You just laugh your ass off at the stupidity.  Well, you certainly didn't miss anything as far as the pregame.  No.  But they got something new.  Maybe they started the last year or a couple years now, but they have a red carpet. 
[00:30:00]  Really?  Like, it's an award show.  For what?  And then they...  For who?  And then these celebrities that have nothing to do with football, you know, walk the red  carpet and they interview them and stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  That makes no sense at all.  It's just...  It's all about the hype.  What happened with the people that couldn't get in?  Oh, the 400 people?  There's like 400 people.  That had to keep the people safe.  They couldn't get in.  Because they added more seats.  But that stadium is giant.  Couldn't they just put them somewhere else, even if it was just standing room or... 
[00:30:30]  I guess it was...  What did they do?  Does anyone know?  There's a fire hazard or something.  No, I understand why they couldn't sit where they wanted to sit.  They let a bunch of them in for standing room, but there was like 400 that were just  fucked.  And they offered them three times the ticket money back.  Really?  But three times the ticket money pays for your, maybe, airfare hotel.  Yeah, what about fucking horrendous?  And then you're not seeing the game.  Yeah, what about your expenses for exactly?  The plane, the hotel, the restaurants, the hookers.  Yeah, in essence, you took a trip, didn't see what you wanted to see, and then you go 
[00:31:00]  home.  Travis, you got something on this?  Yeah.  It's awful.  Yeah, so there were like 1,200 seats that were deemed...  1,200?  1,200?  Yeah, 1,200 that were deemed unusable.  And what does that stadium fit?  40, 50,000?  Yeah, perhaps.  Probably in the end zone alone.  Fucking places giant.  Jesus.  So, yeah, well, they installed 15,000 temporary seats because they wanted to break the Super  Bowl record.  He's such an asshole, Jerry Jones.  He likes big things. 
[00:31:30]  What a dick.  He likes being number one.  Yes, he does.  He likes overpaying for stuff.  So, I guess because of all the snow and the bad weather, they didn't have time to get  them all put in and, you know, approved by the fire marshal.  So...  They should have gotten the fire guy from fucking Towering Inferno.  He would have approved everything.  Think he would have gotten the job done?  Oh, he just approved like, yeah, who cares?  Where are they?  On top of the fucking furnace?  Good.  They're furnace seats.  So, they relocated 850 of these people to different seats, which I guess they just had 
[00:32:00]  available.  And then the other 400 were put in like a club area behind the Steelers bench, like,  you know, under...  Right, right, right.  ...to watch on big monitors.  Oh, my God.  And everyone gets a big refund.  You're there and you have to watch it on TV.  Yeah.  They should have let everybody...  Probably standing.  Everybody...  They should have let everybody that couldn't get a seat play in one play. 
[00:32:30]  They're able to go out on the field and actually participate in one play.  That's gotta suck, huh?  Yeah, so they...  Yeah, you go all the way there and turn it away.  To get a refund for triple the face value.  Didn't I?  Were you uncomfortable when you saw Cameron Diaz feeding A-Rod grapes or chips or whatever  the fuck it was?  I think it was popcorn.  Was it popcorn?  Yeah.  Might as well have been grapes.  Grapes.  She said she should have been fanning him with a big fucking leaf.  She's just beating him. 
[00:33:00]  Go ahead, sorry.  He got...  That got booed at the stadium.  Oh, good.  When they showed up.  He's just a fucking asshole.  And it took how long?  How long?  30 minutes.  Not even 30 minutes.  30 minutes.  It took a quick 30 minutes for an animated GIF to be up on the internet of it looped.  Him just being fed popcorn by Cameron Diaz.  That's great.  You think that was staged?  No.  They probably saw her feeding him and was like, all right, get the camera on that.  Oh, fuck.  We got to get this on.  Okay. 
[00:33:30]  Exactly.  You're right.  Get the camera on that.  Why'd she feed him for this long?  Yeah, boy.  He's eating a lot of popcorn.  And she feeds him the same exact way each time.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I bet she dips her fingers in her pussy first.  That's how he licks them.  Oh, that's it.  Hot, hot buttered.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right.  Let's say hi to Corey in Atlanta.  Corey.  And the bottom of the popcorn thing is cut out.  And this big hog is stuck through the bottom.  Corey, what's going on? 
[00:34:00]  Hey, did you guys see the Kim Kardashian Skechers Shape Ups commercial?  No.  You didn't see it?  What happened there?  The hot piece of ass with the geriatric shoes on.  Now I understand why.  I finally understand why she's so famous.  Yeah.  Because she's goddamn ridiculously hot.  Really?  Because she's a fucking airhead that frustrates a lot of people.  Yeah.  But then you see what her body looks like in this Shape Ups commercial.  Holy shit.  Well.  You didn't see this?  No, I didn't. 
[00:34:30]  You don't like the ethnic broads, though, so you might have a tough time looking at this.  No, no.  I mean, she's not so ethnic looking.  I don't really know how to say this.  But what's she doing with a white guy?  She's doing a commercial, though, for old men's sneakers.  These Shape Ups.  Oh.  Well, that's not completely true.  I am working out.  It's not someone else.  It's something else.  Bye-bye, trainer.  Hello, Shape Ups.  Yeah, she does look good. 
[00:35:00]  She's sexy.  I'll give you that.  She looks really fucking good.  She does look good.  She has every right to be an airhead, if you have a body like that.  Just to show her father getting in shape, hiding murder weapons.  Doing a sprint with a black bag full of who knows what.  Horrible.  She got her acting chops from her father.  Oh, her father.  Who was a terrible actor, because he put that holy shit, he's innocent face on.  That is nothing better than watching that verdict, and watching Robert Kardashian's face.  His mouth literally opened up, and he looked around like, wait, he's guilty, you dummies. 
[00:35:30]  He was thinking, they bought this shit.  What?  Right.  Are we that good?  It's my favorite part of the OJ trial.  There it is.  There it is.  Look at his face.  This is Kim's father, of course.  I love his face.  I found that fast, Danny.  Bravo.  This is Orinthal James Simpson.  Case number BA097211.  We, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant, Orinthal James Simpson, 
[00:36:00]  not guilty of the crime of murder in violation of penal code section...  Robert Kardashian looks, he can't fucking believe it.  He's not smiling.  Like, Johnny Cochran is smiling, OJ's smiling, Johnny Cochran put his arm around OJ, they're  like, yeah, yeah, and Robert Kardashian is there, like, he looked around, he turned  his head and went, you literally can hear him thinking, what the fuck, he, what? 
[00:36:30]  Either that or OJ had a really bad gasser at that moment, and he was just, maybe he's  just smelling an OJ fart.  Yeah, Danny just froze it on a perfect face, like, of him just going, no.  He's in shock, like, what?  But you just let a murderer go.  How great is it, two of them are dead, the two guys staying next to OJ are dead.  Yep.  How perfect.  Yeah, that is, like, and OJ's in prison.  That's fucking fantastic.  The only one, the only one who did anything right after this, and this was probably to  make up for this despicable, was Barry Sheck, who's in the project Innocence, who started 
[00:37:00]  that, yeah.  Yeah, Barry Sheck was like...  He's trying to save fucking innocent people.  He's trying to fight off the devil, is what he's doing.  Yeah.  He's trying to fight off fucking living in hell for eternity.  Yeah.  Like, Kardashian.  Or, it looks like he saw a ghost, or smelled a fart, or...  Yeah.  He went like, what the fuck?  He literally looked like a man in shock.  Mm-hmm.  Because he knew the truth, and couldn't believe it.  Yeah.  What a moment.  What a moment.  Well... 
[00:37:30]  To OJ.  Trying to see if we, anything else we missed here.  Missed.  You know, there's the...  Yeah, there's the specifics of the game, but who wants to go into that?  Nah.  You know, a couple of key turnovers.  Yeah.  Yeah, a couple of key turnovers were very, um...  Key.  Key to the game.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  I guess that's it.  Talk about that crap.  That's all you need to do.  Yeah.  You don't really have to, like, spend too much time on the commercials or anything like that. 
[00:38:00]  Any other commercial?  I can't...  No.  No.  I had little kids running around my house, too, so I had to concentrate on that.  Concentrate on them not killing themselves?  Nah, it's just...  What age has he got now?  My little nephew's adorable, little Warren.  How old are they?  But he just throws popcorn all over my rug.  How old are they?  I don't know.  And now that he didn't throw popcorn on my head, I'm gonna cut you off on the...  Hedge off of the past there. 
[00:38:30]  On the rug.  With those fucking...  With those fucking jokes, you assholes.  That's...  I know where they're going.  Cut him off in the past.  Nice.  Yeah, he's a little Warren's, like, fucking two and a half or something like that.  Terrible twos?  Does he get the terrible twos?  He's a sweet little kid.  Yeah.  But kids are just stupid.  Yeah, of course they are.  They're dumb.  So, like, I opened a window because it was getting a little warm inside because we were  playing some of that goddamn Xbox Kinect.  Nice. 
[00:39:00]  Holy shit.  I am aching, by the way, all over from playing Xbox Kinect.  What game?  Bowling.  And then we were playing track and field, which is like, you gotta, like, sprint and  run in place and throw javelins and fucking discus and things.  What is it?  Decathlon?  Hurdles.  Yeah.  In your living room?  It's crazy.  I don't know if I'd want to do that.  Bah, bah, bah, bah.  I was, like, doing that and then I had my, like, heavy combat boots on.  So, trying to lift your legs up to run in place is, uh, and then boxing. 
[00:39:30]  I was, I was doing boxing with, uh, this little seven-year-old Gia and she kicked my  ass.  Because she just, her fists are going a mile a minute and I'm trying to use finesse.  Right.  And she's just beating me senseless.  Trying to get a couple jabs in and she's just going roundhouse on you.  And to watch a seven-year-old kid just go, ha, ha, when you fall down, when your avatar  falls down on the canvas.  It's like, you just want to curse. 
[00:40:00]  Eh, screw you.  Uh.  And then, uh, yeah, so I open up a window to cool off a little bit.  Right.  And the little kid, uh, Warren just stands by the window.  He goes, it's cold outside.  And then, and then my sister Dawn, uh, his mommy is like, well, come away from the window.  And then he just gives this look at her like, no.  And then turns his head back and gets closer to the window and yells outside.  It's cold outside. 
[00:40:30]  And you just walk away from the window, you dunce.  He's two and a half.  Yeah, but it's like, that's where it's cold.  Move.  He doesn't understand that yet.  No, they're little.  Yeah, they are.  It's like taking care of little tiny retarded people.  That's what you got to do.  And then you got to, you know, oh, don't play with that.  I told him at one point, he walked up to the Kinect and he touched it a little.  I was like, oh, Warren, I go, don't play with that.  And it is a toy.  But I said, it's not a toy.  You just say things you heard when you were a kid. 
[00:41:00]  It's a rubber ball.  That's not a toy.  Don't play with that.  It's not a toy.  And he then turned around and for about five minutes just stared at us, wouldn't respond  to anything, and looked like Damien from The Omen just looking at us.  I'll get you.  It was frightening.  Like, kids can be very scary.  He just stared at us.  Like, all right, touch it.  I don't care.  Stop looking at us like that.  I can't try to smother you in the middle of the night or something.  You little creepy thing.  Jesus. 
[00:41:30]  Jesus.  That's funny.  Scary.  Oh, then Travis's little kid running around.  Jesus Christ, what the hell does she think?  It's a track?  You've got a lot of kids in your house for someone that doesn't want to have kids.  She's in her jammies running around.  And then every time I'd be like, hi, Riley.  She starts crying and runs to her daddy.  She warms up.  No, she doesn't.  Yeah, well, maybe not to you.  I heard she doesn't like men.  So it's like, oh, she runs to her father quick enough.  Yeah.  Knowing that whole thing.  I get it.  You know, the beard.  I get it.  Travis is like a girl. 
[00:42:00]  She runs around your house because, you know, you, believe it or not, have a much larger  house than I do.  Ah.  Okay.  I was waiting for her to bounce off a column like a pinball.  It would have been great.  Just bing, bing.  And then when kids run, you've got to have the parent right behind them, running after  them, hunched over.  I'm sure that just something terrible is going to happen at any minute.  You know, and for some reason, Travis, this kid, really, how old is he?  18, 19 months?  Favorite thing in the world? 
[00:42:30]  Stairs.  Yeah, stairs.  That's great.  Nothing more fun than going up the stairs and down the stairs and up the stairs and down  the stairs.  Doesn't make me nervous.  In feety pajamas.  That's not making everyone terrified.  In slippery, feety pajamas.  I'm not worried about getting fat anymore.  They just like doing terrifying things.  Yeah.  They don't want to play with the safe shit ever.  I don't pay attention.  It's always the most terrifying thing in the room.  That's what they go for.  Like, I tell people, like, hey, your kid's doing this, and then they've got to go, you  know, take care of it.  Like, I told Dawn. 
[00:43:00]  I was like, hey, boy, Warren sure liked throwing popcorn on my rug.  And then she goes, oh, oh, and she's got to go and scoop it up.  I'm not going to clean it up.  What an asshole.  It's like, it's your kid.  He spilled the popcorn.  What an asshole.  You do have a much safer house, though, than most other people.  Yeah, because a lot of room.  Yeah, there's a lot of room, and a lot of your tables are high.  Yeah, and I have the soft little ottoman thing.  That's not for kids, though.  That's for me after a few weekends.  You know, I don't want to pull a Bill Holden. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Bill Holden, who, by the way, was in the towering inferno.  All right, there you go.  Hey, why combat boots if you're playing Kinect?  I couldn't find my sneakers this morning, so I just threw the boots on.  Right.  And, yeah, it makes it really hard to lift your legs up for, like, the soccer.  Fuck that.  And some of the other games, you really got to use your legs a lot.  Right.  How can we mess with this?  The computer's not going.  Danny, what's the matter?  What did you do to the computer? 
[00:44:00]  It just stops working.  I know.  It just stops.  Do they fix it?  Do they bring this stuff up, though?  No.  No, they're giving me a new one.  Oh, they're finally giving you a new one?  That's good.  Oh, and then someone's going to fucking load it up with malware and shit.  How are you going to protect against that?  A password.  We have procedures.  Oh, in place.  We have procedures in place that will...  We spoke about this offline.  Oh, good.  Offline.  My new machine was blue-skied.  Nice.  Oh, it was.  It's still baking a little bit, though, right?  Good.  Because it's not in here yet.  Yeah, I guess it is still baking.  They'll take it out of the oven and give it to me soon. 
[00:44:30]  Maybe it's in a bucket somewhere.  Oh, fuck the buckets.  The bucket.  The stupid buckets.  I forgot about the buckets.  I still don't understand the bucket analogy, but...  Jason in Indianapolis.  How are you, Jason?  Jason.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Morning.  Hey, what do you guys think?  I'd like to hear your thoughts on some of the trailers that they premiered,  specifically what looks like to be an E.T. remake from J.J. Abrams  and the Thor and Captain America trailer.  Yeah, I don't know what that was.  J.J. Abrams and Spielberg, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's that?  Super 8. 
[00:45:00]  Super 8.  Super 8.  Correct, right.  And what the fuck is that about it?  It's about a motel, I think.  It looks really, really stupid.  Red Roof was good.  The movie trailers looked awesome.  Yeah, yeah.  They were way better than the regular commercials, the regular Doritos car commercials.  Transformers.  When we say Cowboys vs. Aliens looked amazing.  Captain America, was it?  Cap.  Oh, they're just calling it Cap?  Cap.  All the cool kids.  Cap America.  All the cool kids.  And then they had, uh, yeah, the, uh, the 8, what was that again? 
[00:45:30]  Super 8.  Super 8.  Jesus.  Super 8.  Still waking the fuck up.  Super 8.  Super 8.  Who's playing Captain America?  I'll take this to you.  Some British guy.  Some guy.  Is this Super 8?  Yeah.  This is.  Yeah, Super 8 definitely looked like it was some kind of E.T. thing going on.  I don't know what it is.  I couldn't make it out.  The U.S. Air Force closed section of Area 51.  Oh boy, another Area 51 thing.  Oh my God, that's like Close Encounters.  Dude, this is a scene out of Close Encounters.  They're supposed to, all materials are supposed to be transported to a secure area in Ohio. 
[00:46:00]  Ohio?  I'm going to pick up trucks.  Some faggot of truck driving down the train tracks.  With a train coming at them, why would you do that?  From the excuse.  Steven Spielberg.  Oh boy.  Crashes into the train.  Train kind of.  Wow.  Wow, that's a great train wreck sequence.  J.J. Abrams.  Yeah.  He's fucking good.  Yeah.  He's just fucking good.  That looked like the fucking train wrecking Arthur though, when it was fucking the one  in his bedroom. 
[00:46:30]  Alright, very flaming wreckage of the...  Yes.  I don't know what's going on.  It arrives.  Okay.  It's Cloverfield 2.  Aw, shit.  It's an Air Force railroad car.  And the door is being bashed open from the inside.  And then...  But couldn't they do that while the train was...  I hate that shit. 
[00:47:00]  What happened?  Why are they busting through the metal side of the train car?  They could have done that while their train's going down the tracks.  Maybe something was keeping it at bay as it was on the...  Maybe it was sleeping.  Yeah, you woke it up.  And then once the train wrecked, yeah, he'd go in like, oh, I'm leaving.  That was just stupid.  I don't know.  That looked good.  It looks great.  And then Cowboys and Aliens look cool too.  Yeah, that'll probably be a bust because it looked way too cool and the concept is way 
[00:47:30]  too cool.  Yeah, it is.  They'll fuck it up, I'm sure.  Cowboys and Aliens, it's great.  Yeah, well, we'll see.  When do those come out?  Soon, I hope.  In the summer.  We getting anyone from those movies?  We get J.J. Abrams.  I'm sure.  We got Steven Spielberg.  We've had the J.J. on.  Steven Spielberg.  J.J. enjoyed our show.  Yeah, he did.  Why don't we take a break?  We got Kevin Smith coming in today.  Ooh.  I believe a guy that did not watch the Super Bowl yesterday because I saw a few of his tweets  and he was talking about everything but the Super Bowl. 
[00:48:00]  He's more a hockey guy.  I don't think he likes football at all.  We'll ask him.  I don't think he saw any of the Super Bowl.  Maybe he did.  And then you got Piers Morgan coming in today.  He's the new Larry King.  How do we get him?  That's pretty big.  He's like in the news and pretty popular and topical.  How the hell did we score that?  I don't know.  That's a biggie, I guess.  I got a call and his people said, okay.  He rolled a bright fuck.  That was probably Harry Morgan from MASH.  Horse hockey.  Right? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's going to come in and finger Sophie, his horse.  Sophie, his horse.  And then Brooklyn Decker from the Adam Sandler movie.  What's the Adam Sandler movie called again?  Just Go With It.  Just Go With It.  Right, right.  I should know that because they promote the hell out of it during the Super Bowl.  I would ask Harry Morgan.  I would only ask him how awful it was to look at Radar's horrid hand.  Yeah.  And how you got through a scene without your eyes shifting to that fucking claw.  Yeah.  Did it get gnarled while he was feeding an apple to Sophie? 
[00:49:00]  To Sophie.  Go.  Go.  Who's that chick?  That's Brooklyn Decker, man.  God damn it.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  Exactly.  Those could be the roundest orb tits.  Yeah.  She's lovely.  She had a pretty face, too.  They look like they're naturals, too.  Who does she look like in the face?  She looks like Travis.  Right.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  Pretty.  Yeah.  She's beautiful.  No, she looks like...  She did a good job in the damn movie. 
[00:49:30]  She could act on top of looking like that.  That's a rare combination.  Meg Ryan, she looks like.  Oh, like young Meg Ryan.  Before Meg Ryan fucked up her face with all the plastic surgery.  She got the duck lips now, doesn't she?  Give me a picture of Meg Ryan.  She got the duck lips.  Meg Ryan was a pretty damn looking girl.  Meg Ryan was like America's little sweetheart back in what I call the day.  Then she decided to just completely fuck up her face.  And guess who she's going out with?  Who?  An old friend of ours. 
[00:50:00]  John Cougar Mellencamp.  That's right.  I just saw it on the website.  John, I think he's just John Mellencamp now, right?  I call him John Cougar still.  He'll always be John Cougar.  John Cougar.  Mellencamp.  And speaking of Cougar, there's this chick.  Jesus.  What is that?  What the fuck, dude?  Is that her?  That's a couple years ago.  What a shitty wig.  Her face is frozen, man.  Why does everybody want to fucking look like the Joker?  I don't know.  Why do these women all want to look like the Joker?  I don't get it.  I think because they just keep going with the plastic surgery. 
[00:50:30]  I think God gives you one or two.  Yeah.  But they just keep going and going.  I've seen a few episodes of that Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.  It's one of my favorite shows, I'm embarrassed to say.  The only reason I even stopped to watch it is because I was clicking through.  Couldn't believe what they looked like.  I was horrified by what they had done to themselves.  Who's your favorite?  That means you've seen this a couple times. 
[00:51:00]  No, I've seen it enough to know.  Who's your favorite?  My favorite to watch is that Kim fucking Richards lunatic.  She's in fucking sane.  She's literally a crazy person.  They hinted that she's a fucking alcoholic.  Yeah, and has ridiculous emotional problems.  But then you look at her, she was cute in the little fucking child actress days.  What a surprise.  Another child star had gone bad.  Yeah.  Because she couldn't handle all that fame and pressure as a 10-year-old, 11-year-old. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, and her and her sister yelling at each other in a limo.  I saw that.  And you know who they're related to, right?  Paris Hilton.  Yeah, Paris Hilton.  They're part of that whole thing.  I'm a big fan of Kyle.  Kyle's my favorite.  Who's Kyle?  She's the brunette.  But she didn't get as much work done as the rest of them.  Is that the sister?  I have no idea.  Yeah, Kim Richards' sister.  Kyle.  Kyle.  She kind of has like a, she almost looks like Paris Hilton with dark hair.  She looks a little more normal, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  But then some of those blondes are just, their faces are all pulled back.  They got the duck lips and the collagen.  And they're walking around, and they can't do anything about the neck.  So the neck just looks fucking like Andy Rooney's neck with fucking like a real stretched face.  Oh God, those women are horrid.  I don't know what possesses them to do the duck pill lips.  I don't know.  It's not good.  It doesn't look good.  I want fuller lips. 
[00:52:30]  If they could do that, that would be good.  You're not getting fuller lips.  You're getting duck lips.  Who started the duck lips?  Who was the one big one that started it?  Barbara Hershey.  Barbara Hershey.  I think Barbara Hershey.  Wasn't it Meg, the one married to the, Meg, I want to say Griffin so bad.  Meg, help me out there.  She was in a movie once.  Oh.  And she's been famous ever since. 
[00:53:00]  No, not Meg Ryan.  And she hangs out with the.  Meg Griffith, right?  Meg Griffith?  Yeah.  Yeah, Meg Griffith.  I think she starred in the duck lip thing.  I think she was the first to really go too far with it.  Isn't she with Antonio Banderas?  There you go.  Yeah, her.  Oh, Melanie.  Melanie.  Sorry.  Melanie.  That's it.  Melanie.  Thank you.  That was the problem.  I think she starred in that whole fucking over-the-top duck lip thing.  Yeah.  Horrendous.  Yeah, because she had like thin, thin Irish lips.  And she got them all bloated up. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, God.  Look at that shot.  Yeah, she's a.  There's a million of them.  She's just trying to find the best one, but there's a million of them.  And when you see her talk, her lips look like they're destroyed.  Like they're constantly in need of a chapstick.  Oh, God.  What a wreck.  Yeah, look at that on the left.  I don't think your top lip is supposed to be bigger than your bottom lip ever.  It does just look like she took a punch.  Right.  Just be a white girl.  Just have your fucking thin, awful fucking Melanie Griffith lips. 
[00:54:00]  It doesn't make you look big.  You're not looking sexy.  It looks like you can't even take your eyes off of it.  No.  And it's not out of beauty.  It's out of, ew, what the fuck did you inject in your lips?  Looks silly.  Silly.  They call you rubberneck.  Just fixated on jerky boys these days.  All right, we'll break.  Very disappointed.  I don't think there was any soup today.  No?  I'm sure Kenny's going to come in with an entire fucking soliloquy on what happened to the soup. 
[00:54:30]  Why don't we do it on the air?  Yeah, huh?  All right, we'll break.  So, busy show.  We've got Kevin Smith once again.  Piers Morgan coming in.  He's the new Larry King on CNN.  Yeah.  He's doing okay so far.  Yeah.  Have you seen any of his interviews?  No.  Kind of doing just a one-on-one thing.  Taped interviews.  So, it's not like Larry?  It's not like he's replacing Larry?  Does he still have the light bright set behind him?  No, no, no.  That went with Larry?  Yeah, completely.  Yeah.  Reed did the whole set.  Oh.  And Brooklyn Decker with Just Go With It. 
[00:55:00]  Adam Sandler's new movie.  Is she coming in?  Yeah.  That's going to be fucking insane.  How do you talk to her?  I'm really going to lose my mind.  Yeah.  You know me when these fucking attractive girls come in.  My voice goes up three octaves and I just babble and ramble like an idiot.  You think she'll smell good?  Oh, God, yeah.  She doesn't smell good.  Fuck.  I hope she's pitting out.  I love armpit smell.  Oh, that would be great.  I do, actually.  If she smelled like urine.  Fuck you.  Oh, fuck you. 
[00:55:30]  Let's eat.  All right.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Virus.  Serious.  Serious.  Serious.  Serious.  Serious.  Serious.  Serious.  Morning to everybody.  Kind of talking about the Super Bowl a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  I think we're pretty much done with that.  Yeah.  What do you think of Mark Sanchez?  Do you think he's sleeping with a 17-year-old? 
[00:56:00]  I wouldn't blame him.  It's one of those.  You said the same thing about Gary Glitter.  He lives in New York?  I don't know, to be honest.  What state does he live in?  That's key, right?  I know age of consent is 17 in New York.  What is it in Jersey?  I don't know.  He could have a Jersey home.  I don't know.  Do you know if a girl's 17, you can have sex with her?  You just can't show her pictures of nudes, any pornography. 
[00:56:30]  Or you can't take pictures of her being nude.  But you can have sex with her.  Kind of creepy you know this.  Oh, I know.  Like the back of your hand, right?  For most states.  Anywhere you've seen...  How many states did you have to look up over the last few years?  Probably a good...  I'll be honest, probably like five.  Probably five states.  I'd be like, well, man...  Was there a close one?  It's like, how about...  One, I had to go, how about you come see me? 
[00:57:00]  Because I can't...  New Jersey's 16?  Get the fuck out of here.  That has to be one of those 16...  Sign them out of your differences.  If the difference in age is no more than five years.  Oh, you know that too.  There's that one.  And in Massachusetts, that's a real weird one.  The age of consent is 17, unless she's a virgin.  And then it's 18.  So you could have sex with...  But how do you prove she was a virgin?  Exactly.  Thank you.  Well, who's going to be peeking in there? 
[00:57:30]  Menino?  She's a virgin.  They just bundled the jobs I love here in Boffittston.  They're checking for virginity.  Well, that's going on.  But the Jets aren't talking.  Why would they talk?  Everyone's mad that the Jets aren't talking.  What's there to say?  They're not commenting on the story that's coming out.  I think tomorrow, maybe.  Or today.  New Jersey and New York's statutory rape laws apply for minors under the age of 17. 
[00:58:00]  Any consenting relationship between Sanchez and a 17-year-old,  presumably would not violate those state laws.  Okay.  So Jersey and New York, he's good.  All right.  That's a man act.  Good for him.  Also...  How old is he, by the way?  He's 20-something, man.  Wow.  He's a couple years in, so maybe 24?  Oh, well, that ain't shit.  20, 24, 25 tops.  What's the problem?  He could go down to probably fucking 14 then. 
[00:58:30]  24.  24 years old.  Did I say that?  24 and a 17-year-old is not...  That's nothing.  Yeah, that's...  You know what?  When I first read the story, I'm kind of thinking, whoa, that's a little creepy.  Yeah.  But 24, 17...  That's nothing.  Yeah.  So seven years difference?  Right.  Okay.  I don't know why I thought Sanchez was like a 45-year-old man, which makes it a little stranger.  I know.  You always think it's like, all right, he's a quarterback.  Right.  Yeah, Jets.  He's a young guy.  He's a young guy having a little fun with a 17-year-old. 
[00:59:00]  Has anyone seen pictures of her?  I guess that's all coming out tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  What do you mean?  Or today?  I don't know.  Is that a big unveiling?  I think so.  Is she hot?  I think they're just getting all their shit together, and then they're going to go with  it.  Or she'll frump standing next to Darth Vader, the blaster.  It's so awkward every time I see him here.  Oh, my God.  Every morning.  I feel like I've made fun of him on TV.  I'm like...  Oh, yeah.  Well, fuck that.  All right.  Hey, you know, you've got to take your beatings. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, we caught you, you know?  You get when you fuck a monster.  You did.  You know, when a guy gets caught...  What the hell was his name?  Steve Young?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Steve Phillips.  Steve Phillips.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  That monster that he was having sex with, that fucking...  That frump with the...  She's holding a little blaster at the Star Wars fucking...  What an awful picture.  Greatest photo ever. 
[01:00:00]  Oh.  And because of that, now he's stuck in this shithole.  And I say that because that's what he portrays on his face.  Every time you see him, like, well, I'm stuck here because of this intern.  He's stuck in radio jail.  Yeah.  He is miserable here.  This is radio jail.  So it seems he's miserable.  Look at that disaster.  If that doesn't look like E-Rock grew his hair out...  I hate the way she's...  Kidding E-Rock.  She's in fat, long calves.  She's really hideous.  If you're going to fuck up your entire career, make it good.  You better fucking pick up a real babe. 
[01:00:30]  Get a bevy.  You see him around here, like, every morning?  Every fucking day.  Really?  Every day.  Maybe I've missed him.  He doesn't want to say hi to anybody, and he looks completely miserable.  Like, he's just hoping that his phone rings and they get him out of here.  He looks like he knows that you know.  Oh, is he?  Oh, really?  You think that's it?  Not the no, you know, he knows face.  He's just like, you know, we all get our coffee.  I try to say hi to him.  I actually try to say hi to him twice. 
[01:01:00]  I never go for the second one if the first one's the blow-off.  Yeah.  But I try twice.  He doesn't want anything to do with anybody around here.  Let me see his picture.  He wants Major League Baseball to call him and get him out of here.  Let me see his picture.  You haven't seen him walking around?  No, I probably have, but I don't recall it.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I've seen him.  You have?  I walked up to him once with the bullhorn, though, and I went...  I'm here with your girl.  And then his dick got hard.  Yeah.  Like, oh, God. 
[01:01:30]  Nice picture.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I've seen him walking around.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, the I know you know look.  That's funny.  And it's funny because that Star Wars girl, like, I think of her every day now.  Because that's what pops in your head when you see him.  Fucks thing in the morning almost every day.  Oh, mercy.  Were you a Gary Moore fan at all?  Gary Moore.  He died.  You don't know who he is? 
[01:02:00]  I think he did a little Thin Lizzy.  I think he did a little Thin Lizzy, but I just knew him when he was doing the blues thing.  Oh, okay.  Was he the main Thin Lizzy singer?  When Thin Lizzy had all their hits?  I did not know that, to be honest with you.  Yeah, he made a blues album, Still Got the Blues for You, or Still Got the Blues, something  like that, which was a great fucking CD.  I loved it many, many years ago.  He died over the weekend at the age of 58.  Really?  You don't know much about him? 
[01:02:30]  No, no.  I liked a few Thin Lizzy songs, but I didn't know enough to even know who the fuck was in  it.  Yeah.  Oh, well, Godspeed.  Oh, you don't like the blues, so can you play Still Got the Blues, a little piece, just  to drive Anthony nuts today?  I bet it goes like...  It did a little differently.  Oh, I hate the fucking monotonous blues.  Here you go.  This was Gary Moore. 
[01:03:00]  He's making his guitar gently wee.  That doesn't sound bad.  That's pretty sound.  He knew how to play the guitar.  Jesus.  Nice, clean sound.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, those are good.  That's not him singing, though, I don't think.  This is some mellow...  Or is it?  I don't know.  I don't...  This is fuck music.  I can't fuck the lyrics. 
[01:03:30]  No?  No.  I can't get jerked off to them, either.  I need...  Like, Yanni, or some kind of great massage music.  You can't fuck to A-Ha?  Or Wang Chung?  No.  Safety dance, I can.  Imagine having to fuck to Everybody Wang Chung tonight.  How awkward that would be.  What did the Gary Moore die of?  It was so long ago.  At 58.  What do you think?  You want to guess? 
[01:04:00]  I really don't know.  I'm going to say some type of long battle with the cancer.  He had leukemia.  Did he?  I'm going Alki Hall.  Is Jimmy acting?  Yeah.  You're going Alki Hall?  No, I don't think of a self...  I'm going Alki Hall.  I don't think they said.  They didn't say?  I don't know.  I don't...  The boys are back in town.  The boys are back in town. 
[01:04:30]  Doesn't say?  Doesn't say, huh?  Why?  Moore, a former member of the influential Irish band, died in a hotel in southern Spanish town  of Estoponia, where he was vacationing.  Outcoming of an autopsy.  It could be a little dope, maybe.  We'll await the outcome.  Oh, boy.  That doesn't mean he was sick before this. 
[01:05:00]  The article also went on to say that there was no foul play.  It didn't look suspicious.  So his heart gave out.  Probably drugs or heart.  But drugs can be no foul play.  Sure.  That's just, you know.  Who knows?  We'll keep you updated.  So Gary Moore was the lead guitarist for Thin Lizzy, and then went on his own.  Did he sing, though?  I honestly don't know.  I guess not.  The singer died a while ago.  He did?  Yeah.  Dreamy's lying.  No, that I'm actually reading truth about.  Oh.  I forget his name. 
[01:05:30]  Can you look him up, Danny?  The singer of Thin Lizzy?  Oh, yeah.  I can't tell.  Hollywood's a good song by Thin Lizzy.  I'm not a huge fan.  But Hollywood's a really good song.  Tonight is gonna be a jailbreak.  Hollywood's better.  Hollywood, down on your luck.  I wasn't a big Thin Lizzy fan.  Me neither.  It's like, yeah, a couple of songs.  He'd be like, eww.  Find that one, E-Rock.  I want to hear what that sounds like.  You got Ricky Warwick was lead vocal.  Oh, actually, no, that's new.  I'm sorry.  That's a new guy.  The original guy.  Dan in Connecticut.  Dan?  Hey, Opie. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Dan.  Yeah, Opie, you're all over the map on this one.  Gary Moore played with Thin Lizzy for one album.  It was called Black Rose.  Phil LaNotte was the singer.  He was the guy that died back in 85.  Okay.  Very good.  With a black guy.  I just, you know, I just wanted to get you straight, because you're just...  Wait, the lead singer with Thin Lizzy was a black guy?  I'll...  Yeah, the lead singer with a black guy.  Oh, I just didn't even know it.  Dan, I'll be completely honest with you.  I had no idea that Gary Moore was even in Thin Lizzy until he died, and they said he was  in Thin Lizzy.  I knew him from that one album, Still Got the Blues, that he did. 
[01:06:30]  Oh.  And the whole album was amazing, and that should have made me, you know, look more into Gary  Moore, but I just never did.  But that album got played a lot when I was living in Buffalo.  Yeah, Phil LaNotte.  He kind of did a metal thing before he went into the blues thing, but he also did all  of the singing.  The guy was actually a pretty good singer also.  So this guy really did nothing.  What do you mean?  I'm just, I'm...  I'm getting the impression this guy really didn't do much.  Ozzy did a song with him. 
[01:07:00]  I don't remember what it was.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, the guy, he was actually a fantastic guitar player, and he had a song when he first  went solo called Victims of the Future, which was a pretty, you know, really a pretty damn  good song.  But, you know, I don't know.  Anyway, I was always a big Thin Lizzy fan.  They were like one of those under a priest.  Jay in Ohio.  Jay.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Jay.  Hey, last dude was right.  He did do, he was in the metal genre for a while, and he did a cover of Shapes of Things 
[01:07:30]  from Faces that was really popular.  Monster guitar player, great blues player, rest in peace, brother.  We're going to miss you.  All right.  58 years old.  And Phil died in 1986, 25 years ago.  Really?  I mean, he looks like...  Did anyone say Weird Al Yankovic?  Yeah.  Someone said it already?  No, I could see it, though.  Ozzy did a song called Lead Clones with Gary Moore.  Lead Clones.  The entire story. 
[01:08:00]  That's it?  That's it.  You have no follow-up?  That was the beginning, middle, and end of this information I have.  You see Ozzy and Justin Bieber's commercial?  Yes.  It was good.  I was happy for him.  That one line he uttered on Amy and Mark's show, which was, who the fuck is Justin Bieber?  What's a Bieber?  Probably got him $2 million for that commercial.  Yeah.  Or whatever he made.  Fucking great.  You know, the Bieb coming out with his movie.  That's the big push.  The 3D movie? 
[01:08:30]  That's what the big push is.  The 3D concert movie?  Oh, boy.  You think that's going to do well?  Yeah.  That's correct.  I'm actually going to go to those theaters and just sniff the seats after everybody leaves.  I'm going to go in and just cut the bottom of the popcorn out, shove my dick through,  and ask anyone next to me if they want some popcorn, because you know that theater is just  going to smell like bubblegum and homework.  Can't wait, huh?  We're all just waiting for Justin Bieber to hit the wall, get a little too old for his 
[01:09:00]  tween audience, and have to move on.  You think he's not going to make it, right?  No, I don't think he's got any long range, you know, he's not in it for the long haul.  Once he starts getting facial hair, the tweens will just be like, oh, well, move on to something  else, the next Bieber.  They're a little fickle.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  It's a horrible audience to have for your livelihood.  They're fickle.  The tween audience?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  Yeah, we heard from a Justin Bieber fan last night, and she was saying, doesn't think he  could sing.  Who?  But he's just cute.  How old?  Fits right in that age bracket.  Was she 12 or 13?  Or is she younger?  14.  Something like that.  Nah, she's too old for the Bieber, I think.  No.  She's starting to get a little too old, 14, 15, right? 
[01:10:00]  I don't know.  How old is the Bieber?  No, what's...  Because same age.  Yeah, yeah, same age.  Because the Bieber is 16.  The Bieber.  Oh, okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm.  But you do get some of the younger ones that you'd think the Bieber could just scare the  shit out of them.  They'd be like, oh, oh, I love you.  You're great.  And then if he just tries to have sex with them, how horrifying it would be for the girl,  thinking it's just going to be like maybe a little peck kiss and sharing a fucking, sharing 
[01:10:30]  some ice cream at Friendly's.  And then he just tries to fucking have sex with her.  I always think that.  They're thinking completely different things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like you just said.  The Bieber's just like...  The Bieber's looking at 14, 15-year-old ass going, I want to get some of that.  Yeah, I want to fuck some of that.  And they're just innocent dopes that just think that they're going to share a fucking  ice cream or something together.  Yeah.  Oh, he'll love me and send me cards for Valentine's Day and he'll text me and I'll text him and  I'll show all my friends his text. 
[01:11:00]  And meanwhile, he's like, you know, doing the old Jay Moore, unzip, what are we going to  do about this?  The girl would be like, what the fuck?  He'll date an older chick eventually, like Ashton Kutcher.  Yeah, when you have a young fan base and it's all young pussy, he'll go with an older woman.  You think?  Yes.  Betty White?  Not that old.  Could you see Justin Bieber and Betty White are the new item?  Oh, God.  He's drilling it into that dried up old hole.  Yeah.  She tells him who was in office when she was his age and he comes immediately. 
[01:11:30]  FDR.  FDR.  Teddy R.  Oh, shit, man.  Yeah, he's probably getting some action.  Yeah, he's probably getting blown.  Yeah, wasn't there a picture of him on a boat with some fucking, who was he on there with?  Was it Selena Gomez?  Yeah, something like that.  Too bad it wasn't Leon Klinghofer that he was on with.  Good reference.  Leon Klinghofer.  I think it was Gomez, right? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Like that wasn't set up, right?  You think it was?  You think it's one of those set up things?  Yeah, come on.  Like when Gay Richard had to take out fucking Christy McNichol because she was a lesbo.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And that was your friend, right?  Yeah.  The Tree Fort guy.  That was Tree Fort Richard.  He was the beard for Christy McNichol.  Because Christy McNichol was into the chicks and that would have ruined her reputation back then. 
[01:12:30]  So Gay Richard would be like her escort.  And, well, when he's not asking if he could suck my cock, he was, you know, he was taking out Christy McNichol.  Would you love to meet her and just tell her that?  Like the other guy that used to take you out, he tried to blow me in a tree fort.  She'd be like, I know.  Shut up. 
[01:13:00]  Let me continue eating this pussy, please.  Why would you be talking to her while she ate it?  How would that happen?  Why am I in the room?  Yeah.  Why wouldn't she just yell, get out first?  She'd actually hear your question and go, look, I'm eating a pussy.  Can you please?  That could be, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wait, wait.  Miranda Cosgrove?  iCarly?  From iCarly?  That's her in a bikini?  She's in the building today?  You know, there's just something wrong going on. 
[01:13:30]  Holy shit.  We better go back to that Age of Consent website.  Oh, really?  How old is she?  Not old enough.  Nah, come on.  She's been around a while.  No, you better give me an age.  You can't just say not old enough.  The iCarly girl's been around a while now.  I think probably 16.  I'd say older.  Not wrong with that.  In certain states, right?  Oof.  In certain houses out on Long Island?  Nah, I'm teasing.  It's never happened.  Swear.  17!  Swearzies.  Ah, she's game. 
[01:14:00]  Great.  She's in.  What is she doing?  What shows is she doing?  Why isn't she doing our show?  We're not the iCarly fucking...  I don't even know who she is.  Yeah.  What is she?  iCarly's kind of...  She's a girl who, at 17 years old, makes $180,000 per episode.  Oh, it's a TV show?  Oh, that's pretty good.  Cool.  You ever see that MTV show, My Life is Liz?  Have you seen that chick? 
[01:14:30]  She's, like, a goofy-looking girl.  Danny, you'd probably like her.  She's got some kind of quirky little look.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  I'm all over it.  See?  You're all over that, right?  Life as Liz?  Yeah, My Life is Liz.  I don't know that one.  I watch that because, you know, she's a teen.  I have to keep up on all the teen shows.  That's what I do.  What a creep.  What a creep.  Just a creep. 
[01:15:00]  You like her, Dan?  Yeah, see?  Now you've got to start watching.  Yeah, now I'm going to start, you know, googling her name with bikini next to it.  Oh, she looks like a Mr. Face.  Oh, she's cute.  Yeah, yeah.  How old is she, though?  She's got a quirky little look.  I don't know.  She's probably 29.  Yeah.  The fuck knows.  Goddamn MTV.  What's going on with that Skins show?  Is that being taken off the air?  I don't know.  I hope not.  I don't know anything.  A bunch of fucking, not a bunch, that stupid parents group. 
[01:15:30]  Scumbags.  I don't even understand what the show's about.  Kind of pulled it.  You know what the show's about, even?  No, it's just about kids, like, fucking, and doing drugs and what kids do in real life.  And I guess people were getting a little pissed off that it looked like kiddie porn.  And I wish that some high-ranking member of the Paris Television Council would get busted  for that.  Yeah?  Oh, I love that.  That's just the worst.  Just find, like, something awful that one of them did. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  I love when the mighty fall like that.  I've sinned against you, my lord.  Remember that fucking guy?  Swaggart, yeah.  Oh, that was so great watching him weeping because he couldn't keep his dick in his pants.  Yeah.  Ah-ha.  He's dead now, right?  Yes, as he should be.  I think he is.  I'm not sure if Swaggart's dead.  Is Swaggart dead?  I think Jimmy Swaggart.  I think so.  No, I don't think so.  Come on. 
[01:16:30]  He'd have popped up somewhere over the years.  No, he is alive.  He's still alive.  He's still alive?  Wow.  How old is he?  Born in March of 35, so he's 75.  Holy shit.  When did he have his big fall from grace?  It's been a while.  It's going to be old.  95?  I might even say before that, dude.  Oh, it said scandal up there.  Yeah.  91?  Well, he's been in trouble since the 80s.  88?  There's an 88 scandal.  There's a 91 scandal.  Ah, yeah.  His crying was the best. 
[01:17:00]  That was some, like, uh...  That shit was all kind of new back then.  Sure.  When you saw that guy crying on TV, you were like, well, this is fucked up.  Now you just go to the internet, you can see all kinds of cool, fucked up shit, but  back then it was kind of like, ooh, this is neat.  88.  Wow.  A current affair would cover it.  Oh, yeah.  That stupid triangle.  A current affair is on.  The first fucking...  That was YouTube before the computer.  A current affair.  You'd be like, oh, look at this clip. 
[01:17:30]  Here's a celebrity fucking fucking up.  What year was the current affair on?  85 to whatever?  Yeah, the Joey Butterfuoco thing really kicked off a current affair.  Got it really going.  They had to make a whole TV show just to cover that story.  86 was on.  86.  Wow.  86 to 96.  And some of the hosts have gone on to other things, huh?  Maureen O'Reilly, right?  Yeah.  Maureen O'Reilly.  Maureen O'Reilly.  Maureen O'Reilly.  Steve Dunleavy was the host. 
[01:18:00]  Wasn't Bill O'Reilly?  I think O'Reilly hosted it.  I think Maureen Povich did.  Did O'Reilly?  Yeah, Povich.  It just says here, presented by Maureen Povich, Maureen O'Reilly, Penny Daniels, John Scott, and Tim Green.  I don't know why I thought...  What did O'Reilly host?  Inside Edition.  Inside Edition.  That's it.  Wow.  I remember that.  What an iconic sound.  You just totally were like, uh-oh, what's on? 
[01:18:30]  Who's fucking up?  Someone's fucking up.  That was tabloid journalism at its infancy.  Pretty cool.  They ought to show some of them.  They ought to rerun those.  That would be a cool little nostalgia thing to watch.  It's going on YouTube.  Yeah, that's true.  Are they on YouTube?  They're everywhere.  All right.  When we take a break, Kevin's going to be here any moment, so we'll clear the field for Kevin.  He's in New York, so he's stopping by.  He's got the big Red State premiere, March 5th at Radio City Music Hall. 
[01:19:00]  Radio City?  Yeah.  Tickets and info at coopersdell.com.  Coopersdell.com.  And in theaters in the fall, October 19th, but you can see March 5th at Radio City Music Hall here in New York City.  And Kevin's going to do a whole thing before the movie with some of the cast members and himself.  Oh, dang.  That sounds like it's going to be a good time.  We'll talk to Kevin in a few minutes.  Also, Piers Morgan a little later.  And from the new Adam Sandler movie, we got Brooklyn Decker.  We're going to get a lot of the stars from the new Adam Sandler movie. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Rumor has it maybe Adam Sandler himself.  What?  I highly doubt it because I don't think he's done radio in many, many years.  Probably not.  You never know.  All right.  Cool.  Get in touch with the O.P. Anthony Show.  Love you guys, man.  Keep kicking ass.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Love your show.  Love you.  Set that backwards. 
[01:20:00]  We'll be right back.  We've got Kevin Smith coming in in minutes, I guess.  Yes.  That should be a good time.  Kevin's pumping a red state.  Yeah.  This looks great, too.  March 5th at Radio City Music Hall.  Yes.  I can't wait. 
[01:20:30]  I want to go to that.  And Kevin said we're going to have to buy our own tickets.  Yeah.  No freebies for this one.  He's not.  That will exclude me from going to that.  Oh, jeepers.  Come on.  Fess up.  We're helping our friend.  I love Kevin.  I know.  Puts you in movies.  Yes, he does.  Which is pretty goddamn cool.  I wish he'd put me in one.  Ask him.  I could act.  Oh.  Why don't you ask him?  Put him on the spot like I did.  Because I don't have the, yeah, I was going to say, I don't have the lack of tact like  you do to just ask, hi, Kevin, put me in a movie, please. 
[01:21:00]  Because you know, like he's saying, well, you're a different case because like you've  done acting, you've been in movies, you know what it's like to go through the whole  process and everything.  For me, he would just be like, oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, and then he'd have to maybe try to find something for me and it would just  be like, bad, me in the, in the background somewhere, just stand there.  I'm sure he'd be terrific.  Embarrassing.  No, I wouldn't be awful.  Ah, Rachel, you've come back. 
[01:21:30]  You've got to ask him now.  You think I should?  Yeah, please do.  You think it would be good if I just ask him, like serious?  Yeah.  I'll just be like.  I've been taking acting classes.  I really want to be in a movie.  Kevin, if you know, I would really like to, I never wanted to ask, but you know, I thought  you'd just see my talent and ask me, but can I be in one of your movies?  Or just start doing a scene.  Don't tell him you're doing it.  Do one from Clerks.  Yeah.  Something from 20 years ago and he'd be like, oh, God. 
[01:22:00]  Or I'll just make up my own like Star Wars related dialogue thinking that it's just as  good as what he can write and then I'd be like, oh, see, he's got it.  Fucking let him in.  He's a geek.  He's talking Star Wars.  Clever dialogue going back and forth.  I don't think so.  You think he'll make believe he didn't ask?  Yeah.  He'll change the subject really quickly.  He'll make like a joke and then just knock it back to it.  Right.  That's exactly what would happen.  We also have Piers Morgan coming in. 
[01:22:30]  He just entered the facility, so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He'll be here at 845.  Now, I know he's got his talk show.  He took over for Larry King, but you watched his, what was he, on the dance show?  No, you asshole.  Nice.  America's Got Talent.  Yeah, that one.  He was on that one.  I like that dumb show.  Now, what?  And Howie Mandel is the new judge, took over for, what's his name, Hasselhoff?  Oh, really?  And he does a good job.  What happened to the Hoff?  He couldn't get it together. 
[01:23:00]  Really?  But they're not talking.  Oh, Jesus.  He's got his issues, so they moved on with Howie.  So this Piers.  Right.  Which is just an odd name.  He, he, uh, what's his background?  Like, why is he all of a sudden?  I think he's a tabloid guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like he likes the gossip and shit?  And I think he did a talk show in England, too.  Oh, so that's where he is.  I believe so, yeah.  Maybe someone can help me out with the info.  Maybe we should know before he gets in.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where he made his bones.  Wait, we have the one sheet? 
[01:23:30]  I think we have a one sheet.  Wasn't he like the editor-in-chief of a tabloid, and then he, then he posted or printed pictures  of someone that was naked, and the pictures were fake, and he got fired.  Oh, shit.  I remember something like that.  He got, he got fired, but then he ended up doing TV in England, and I mean, but what  really is the reason that he's accredited as an interviewer and everything is because  he is the first celebrity apprentice.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So he works for Donald Trump now? 
[01:24:00]  Well, he did.  He was his apprentice, I guess, for a little while.  They don't actually work for Donald Trump, though.  Yeah, they don't really have to work.  And then Bret Michaels was the next celebrity apprentice.  Does he work for Donald Trump?  Probably right now, I would assume, yes, he does.  Hmm.  Huh.  It was feeling falling off a Segway, breaking three ribs.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Morgan was fired from the mirror.  Oh, that was at Sorry We Were Hoaxed, the headline. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  Yeah.  They fired him.  The picture is allegedly showing Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army soldiers.  And that never happened.  Within days, the photographs were shown to be crude fakes.  Holy shit.  Under the headline, Sorry We Were Hoaxed.  But then he did a bunch of specials on BBC channels and stuff, and then he ended up being  a judge on Britain's Got Talent.  Right.  Which led him to America's Got Talent, which led him to becoming the first celebrity apprentice. 
[01:25:00]  And now he's got his own talk show.  Would he be considered like a vulture then?  Yeah.  Like one of these fucking tabloidy vulture guys?  For sure.  Well, that's his background, certainly.  Well, the male has a shit reputation for news.  Yeah, yeah.  They tend to print, I think, a lot of questionable information.  I fucking hate it.  Anytime I see something, because usually I go to Drudge, and then I'll click on a link  that's like, wow, that headline seems a little fucking amazing.  I want to see what that's all about.  And I see it's like the Mirror, the UK comes up. 
[01:25:30]  And it's like, all the English newspapers are bullshit.  They're 20 times worse than the New York Post.  They're just all bullshit stories of things that might happen if 8,000 chains of events  line up perfectly.  And it was weird, because he was like this tabloid guy in England.  And that's what his reputation for, a tabloid guy.  But because he came to America and nobody knew who he was, but he was British, everybody  just kind of took him seriously.  That's what I thought.  Like he's a newspaper editor.  It's that fucking accent. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I actually thought he was this legit kind of guy.  No.  And it turns out he's like fucking Maury Povich.  He's a gossip columnist.  He's a...  And that's how he started, as the editor of the Gossip Column.  He's just always been about getting celebrity dirt.  That's what he does.  And that's why he got the Larry King spot?  Because they were looking to take it a little...  I guess so, but then he's interviewing like Condoleezza Rice, which he's never been a political  journalist.  He's a celebrity gossip guy.  So are they trying to mainstream him a little bit? 
[01:26:30]  I guess I guess...  Why am I asking you these questions?  I'm the Piers Morgan expert.  You really are the Piers Morgan.  I'm a fan.  Are you?  I like Piers Morgan.  You're a fan first.  Yeah, fan first.  Fan first.  What are you a fan of?  Piers Morgan?  You can't be a fan of him.  Why?  He doesn't do anything.  Yeah, he's been on all kinds of TV shows.  He's a judge.  Yeah, but he's good at being a judge.  He's good at being on reality TV.  He's good at being himself.  He's like a Simon Cowell of America's Got Talent.  He's following that formula.  And he kicked ass on Celebrity Apprentice.  But Simon Cowell is like, he produces shows, he's created shows, and then he hosted this. 
[01:27:00]  What?  Piers Morgan just kind of...  But yeah, he just seems to...  I don't know where he came from.  That's why I'm so confused about this guy.  When he got the Larry King gig, I was like, wow, that's weird for CNN to take their premier  spot, even though Larry was completely losing it at the end, to take that premier spot and  throw this guy in that was just a gossip column guy. 
[01:27:30]  He also has his reputation of being really aggressive with interviews and really getting  to the dirt.  So I think CNN thought they were going to get an edgy interview show, whereas some guy  was going to intimidate people into giving good answers.  But you know who's good at doing that?  Shatner.  That goddamn Shatner show is really good.  I want to see the one with...  You see the one with William Shatner and Chekhov from fucking Star Trek?  And Chekhov's like yelling at Shatner because he took a lot of his scenes and his fire off 
[01:28:00]  of Star Trek.  But is he really yelling or is it fun yelling?  No, he was legitimately angry that William Shatner stole everyone's thunder that they  were supposed to get in certain scenes in Star Trek.  Like there are some Chekhov scenes, I guess, where Chekhov thought he should stand out  and Shatner jumps into the scene, bye, Chekhov, what are you doing?  And just like fucked it up.  And he looks awful.  Like Shatner at least stuck with the wig, whatever kind of wig he's wearing.  And Shatner finally figured the wig out. 
[01:28:30]  Have you noticed?  Like Shatner's wig now, it looks like his real hair.  It's short.  It's not the big bouffant on his head.  But Chekhov just said fuck it and he's like got white horseshoe bald head.  Like what happened?  He was doing a comb over on the original Star Trek.  The original Star Trek, he was doing a comb over.  How did we get off of Piers?  I don't know.  Why would we get off of Piers?  Well, there's nothing else to talk about with Piers.  What do you mean?  Well, we interviewed the Kardashians.  That was a ratings bust.  What has he done so far? 
[01:29:00]  He did Howard.  What he did is his big first week, which was Oprah, Condoleezza Rice, Ricky Gervais, Howard.  Clooney.  And Clooney.  Clooney.  Did anything come out of any of these interviews that made like, oh my God, as heard on Piers' show?  The Ricky Gervais clips a little bit went viral because he was very unapologetic about the Golden Globes.  Oh, yeah.  But that was also situational.  And that was out there.  Like without the Piers interview, it still would have gotten out there.  He seems like he's trying to start a feud with Howard so people start talking. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, what is that about?  But Howard's like, there's nothing going on here.  There's nothing going on.  What is it, though?  What was the feud?  Well, Piers is going in and saying, well, Howard, everybody says you're so good at interviews.  I'm going to be the best interviewer out there.  And Howard's like, I've been doing this for a long time.  Whatever.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Yeah, I don't know what you're trying to do here.  All right.  I think Howard probably talks to a few more people than Piers does.  But I'll tell you this. 
[01:30:00]  Howard's never been Celebrity Apprentice.  Well, you know something?  You got him there.  You should have seen the way Piers and Omarosa interacted with each other.  Oh, he was on when the Omarosa was on?  He and Omarosa did not get along.  Who was Omarosa?  She was on the original Apprentice and then became a celebrity to become on Celebrity Apprentice.  So happy I don't know who she is.  Didn't she get knocked in the head with a ceiling tile or something like that?  Yeah, she's not one to mess with, though.  Where is she now?  Probably looking for some reality show to get on or something.  I hate the reality show people that just can't stop. 
[01:30:30]  They just keep going on different reality shows.  They're addicted to it.  And then we got the beautiful Brooklyn Decker.  When's she coming in?  9.30?  9.30.  Goddamn.  She's fucking...  She's smoldering.  Sports Illustrated swimsuit model.  Hands off, though, she's married to Andy Roddick.  What?  The tennis player.  The tennis stud.  Oh!  I thought it was Riddick.  Is it?  From Pitch Black.  Oh.  That really would have been scary. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  That you really would have had to watch out.  He'd kill you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't wait to see what she looks like.  You think she's going to be dressed nicely?  Like, scantily?  Yeah, she's probably coming in a bikini.  Oh, really?  I think so.  For a swimsuit?  Yeah.  She'll just be like, remember me?  No, she's supposed to look really smokin'.  Here comes Kevin down the hall.  Oh, yeah.  And Roland said that she's doing TV, I guess, today.  So she's going to look amazing. 
[01:31:30]  So she's extra, extra made up.  Looking real nice.  Here comes Kevin.  I got to say, I think Kevin lost weight.  Say that and then ask for a movie roll.  That's how you do it.  Butter them up.  Yes.  Always put a compliment out first.  There he is.  Kevin Smith.  How is everybody?  Hi, buddy.  In the house.  Pretty good, brother.  Yeah, doing good.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey.  What's going on, man?  Hey, man.  You lost a lot of weight.  How much weight?  I know.  I was saying when...  65 pounds. 
[01:32:00]  Holy fucking A.  Jesus.  When you're walking down the hall, I said, Kevin lost weight.  I took, what was it?  November 1st.  I'm sorry.  I can't hear it.  Oh, shit.  Goddamn headphones.  November 1st.  Wow.  Yeah, I started just eating a Weight Watchers meal.  It was the ones you buy in a food store.  Yeah.  And then I started walking as well.  Me and Malcolm started walking in the hills.  Once you fucking just stop eating a lot and move around a little bit, it really is ridiculous.  It's portion control.  That was it for me.  At the end of the day, I like to sit down, and that's how I unwind. 
[01:32:30]  I just sit there and eat.  But I can't eat a bowl of cereal.  I kill a box of cereal.  Yeah, yeah.  And then I'm like, there's milk left over.  Let me kill another box.  So at that point, I eat like an American.  And with the Weight Watchers stuff, it just teaches you to portion control.  Like, I remember looking at the meal the first time and being like, there's no way.  I'm going to have to eat fucking five of these in order to be sated.  But after I was done with one, I was like, oh, I guess that's all you really need.  This sounds like an endorsement.  I'm Kevin Smith, and I lost 60 pounds with Weight Watchers. 
[01:33:00]  No doubt, man.  Use me, man.  I'm the guy, too.  I'm the dude who'll hit people.  Like, they always use people like Marie Osmond and shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Use a motherfucker like me where people are like, if he could do it, holy shit, I could  take off the weight.  I've heard him.  It's good.  What are you craving since November?  Nothing, man.  Honestly.  Wow, really?  Well, I think I just fucking, I went so nuts for so long eating whatever the fuck I wanted  that you hit a place where you're like, I'm okay to put it all down for the time being.  There's nothing I missed.  There's nothing I'm like, oh, if I can get my hands on that shit. 
[01:33:30]  Do you have any of the desserts, the Weight Watchers desserts?  I did.  They do a cookie dough ice cream dessert.  It's like 170 calories.  And it's like a one shot.  It's pretty small.  But it's, again, it's enough, just enough sugar or something like that.  You got to get the raspberry chocolate pops.  Is that what you're doing?  Yeah, I love them.  You don't know, but what the fuck?  I don't know.  You're all thin and shit.  We just happen to have one of those.  I ain't going to take any advice from no thin man.  You should get this.  Bullshit.  We happen to have them in the freezer.  And I'm like, God damn, this Weight Watcher food isn't bad at all.  It's not bad.  So now I buy it as my stupid snack. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, my old lady was, one day she saw me cooking up and she was like, how can you eat  that pre-fab food?  I was like, they make a macaroni and cheese.  She's like, really?  She's been eating that and she doesn't even know she's thin.  I don't eat that fat person.  Points or something?  Yeah, I think it was like when I started, I think I had like a max of 31 points a day  or something like that.  And what are you down now, the same amount?  Well, I didn't really follow it strictly in terms of like doing it on the website or blah,  blah, blah.  I just knew here was my ceiling of 31 points.  So for me, I was like, if I'm anywhere below that per day, that's good. 
[01:34:30]  So basically, that's what I would do.  I would just eat like three or four of those meals.  It would be under 31.  Was that for health or vanity or like what made you decide that?  Honestly, I think by the time I got around to it, I don't know if it was, I mean, long  term health, of course, because when you're younger, you don't think like, oh, yeah, any  of this stuff's ever going to come back to haunt me.  I could smoke three packs of cigarettes a day.  I'll live forever.  All I have to do is quit when I'm 50. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like do the deathbed conversion.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry, Lord.  You know, but when I got to 50, I just start dieting heavily.  But I don't know.  I just hit this place where I was like, I'm going to cut weight.  I just got tired of eating, really.  That was it.  Really?  How many more pounds do I want to do?  I'm going to drop 35 more.  So you want to do a solid 100.  And then what happens?  That's the big problem with a lot of people.  They hit their goal weight and then what?  But then they feel like, all right, I could just go back to eat.  It used to be problematic for me because I used to do this diet drink, Optifast, where 
[01:35:30]  essentially you just drink six drinks a day.  And you cut weight fast.  Sure.  But the problem is the moment you start eating again, the weight comes back on.  But I haven't stopped eating.  I've just controlled the eating.  You can't not chew.  When you're fucking, you can't just drink shakes.  You got to chew.  Yeah, there's something about it where it drives you a little crazy after.  But it was good.  I believe in Optifast for people who are like really heavy and stuff, it's an easy way  to cut weight because it tastes kind of good.  I mean, look, there's no easy way to cut weight, but that's kind of a very controlled method 
[01:36:00]  where if you're not eating food or solids, you are going to drop some pounds.  Now, yesterday, I don't think you watched the Super Bowl, did you?  I didn't.  I just literally asked a cabbie.  I was like, who won that football match?  I wasn't sure.  The big football thing.  I was all over Twitter and I read a few of yours.  I'm like, I think he's not watching today.  You were talking about all sorts of other things.  I was talking about like Roseanne or something like that.  The whole world was trying to talk about the Super Bowl and I'm like, Kevin's doing his  own thing today.  Not for me.  I'm a hockey dude, man.  I can't talk to hockey during the Super Bowl.  You can't get into the whole Super Bowl, the pregame, the halftime show, the dumb commercials, 
[01:36:30]  just from a pop culture standpoint.  I'm not like one of those dudes that's like, I'm against it.  I'm just like, I'd rather be anything.  Yeah, I didn't really care about the game.  I just felt like being part of it, I guess.  I don't know.  The party thing becomes more like that.  Like I had a party yesterday, but it's like, hey, you kind of have the game on, on a few  of the TVs and shit, but for the most part, you're just bullshitting with your friends  and fucking off and drinking and eating.  Yeah.  There's all that.  It's like, I think if the Jets were playing or the Giants, I probably would have paid more 
[01:37:00]  attention to the game, but apparently it was a good one.  It was close and turned out to be all right.  It was exciting.  They said it was going to be a close game too.  I saw a picture on TV of A-Rod kissing Cameron Diaz.  That was the only football coverage I saw.  It's even better.  She was feeding him popcorn.  Feeding him popcorn.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That doesn't help his image because he's already looked at as a dick.  Is he really?  Oh, yeah.  In what way?  For what?  Why is he doing it?  He makes too much money, doesn't perform. 
[01:37:30]  There they are.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  He's feeding.  It's just looped.  And now it's looped for everybody's enjoyment.  Cameron Diaz.  I mean, are people irritated by this?  Yeah.  Anytime A-Rod is on video, they're annoyed.  Why don't they like him?  He seems like a decent dude.  He's hateable.  Is he really?  Yeah, man.  What is he?  Does he say shit?  I don't know why.  Hitler was right.  That kind of thing or no?  I remember part of his contract with the Yankees is that he always had to make a dollar  more than Jeter, so he could always be the highest paid. 
[01:38:00]  Did he really?  Just dump shit like that.  Unless there's some rumor I bought into.  People love Jeter, and they just don't like A-Rod.  And this is a dude who used to go with Madonna and stuff like that?  He's been around, yeah, with a few celebrities.  Kate Hudson.  Yep, yep.  And now he's just getting fed by her, by Cameron Diaz.  Cameron Diaz.  Right on, man.  Yeah, yeah.  That didn't bother me.  I saw that.  I was like, oh.  It reminded me of Us Weekly.  I'm like, they're just stars.  They're just like Us, too.  They had a trailer for Cowboys vs. Aliens.  Cowboys vs. Aliens.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you know anything about this movie? 
[01:38:30]  That's the first time I even heard about this damn thing.  Based on it.  And now people are talking about it.  Based on a comic book and Jon Favreau directed it.  That's all I know.  Huh.  Looks good, though, right?  That trailer looks ridiculous.  They had a trailer on, I guess, about three, two, four months ago.  Oh, fuck, I didn't see it.  It's been out for a bit, but it was the first time yesterday.  How was Jon Favreau as a director?  I've never been directed by him.  No, I mean, like, have you ever seen anything he's done?  Yeah, Iron Man.  So have you.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Did you not like Iron Man?  No, actually, I had no clue he directed that. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, yeah, it was his.  He did Iron Man, Iron Man 2.  Oh, okay, then he's good.  Yeah.  I like those Iron Man pictures.  I dub him as good.  Yeah.  He's done a fine job.  And based on the reaction to Cowboys vs. Aliens, apparently he's on a roll.  Well, he's doing this movie next, which I think is going to make a bazillion dollars.  Essentially, it's a night at the museum, but at Disney World.  Oh, right on.  You know what I'm saying?  Like Clothes Park.  Yeah, yeah.  Coming to life.  You can go a million different directions.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I never saw Iron Man 2, and I loved Iron Man. 
[01:39:30]  Did Don Cheadle hurt it or no?  No, he probably helped, I think.  I mean, it's not like, oh, man, we missed the other guy.  Terrence Howard.  They made a joke right at the beginning where he comes up, and they call for Rhodey, and  he walks up the aisle, and then Robert Downey Jr. is just like, hey, man, where have you  been?  And he turns, and you see it's Don Cheadle and not the other dude.  And he goes, look, it's me.  Let's deal with it.  Move on.  And that's all they ever say, and then they move on with it.  That's funny.  But he gets a lot more screen time, man, because he wears the suit. 
[01:40:00]  He becomes a war machine.  He's also wearing a suit.  They fight and whatnot.  Why would Terrence Howard do that?  What a dope.  There was a, somebody put a picture online of a marquee at a movie theater when Iron  Man opened, and it said, Iron Man 2, Terrence Howard 0.  I thought that was kind of cute.  And Mike in Florida saying the $1 more than Jeter is not true.  Yeah, I mean.  It's not true.  Whatever.  I mean, I acknowledge that it was probably a rumor that I bought into.  Mike in Florida, that was just a rumor?  Yeah, but there are a couple of definites about it. 
[01:40:30]  Well, you can all agree he's still a dick, though.  Oh, no.  He's an absolute douchebag.  Okay.  Just an overall feeling.  He signed to Texas for $252 million, and the reason it was an odd number like that is  because the highest sports contract at the time was $126 million, and he put it out there  that he wanted to make double what the highest person ever made.  Scott Boris, I think, was his agent, right?  That's kind of rubbing it in everyone's face.  What does he do?  What's his specialty?  He was a shortstop when I started this. 
[01:41:00]  Ah, blondes.  Yeah, apparently so.  Fat purple lips as well.  What's that, sir?  He's got great purple lips.  We heard you.  We heard you.  Damn it, Jimmy.  Damn you.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  All right.  That's the picture we're talking about.  That's pretty funny.  Who's birthday?  No, they just said that.  That's like a catchphrase for Jimmy now.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Because every day is Jimmy's birthday, because he's a special boy.  Every day is coming up Norton and shit.  Your shirt says Puck, you should be careful.  People are going to misinterpret that. 
[01:41:30]  There have been a few places.  Where was I?  KTLA Morning News.  They're like, can you please stop wearing that?  I was like, wow.  And they're like, because it's too confusing.  And I'm like, it's a P, not a Puck.  It's not confusing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's hockey jersey.  It's a hockey jersey.  It's a Puck.  I was told to turn my shirt inside out once going into Disneyland in California.  What did it say?  It said something.  I hate Jews.  I was just going to say the worst possible thing ever.  I cleaned it up a little.  I can't do Hitler backwards.  It was one of those shirts where if you look at it, it just looks like a bunch of squiggly lines and spaghetti. 
[01:42:00]  But if you look close, it was an orgy going on.  It was just like a bunch of little people interlocked and having an orgy.  I was young.  I was making statements on my chest.  Everybody, I believe in sex.  And I don't even know how the person saw what it was.  It was that vague.  You know, you really had to look close.  But they're like, you can't go in the park with that shirt. 
[01:42:30]  It's not up to Disney standards.  And I was like, oh, shit.  So I had to wear an inside out shirt.  And I was broke back then.  So I couldn't even buy like a Mickey shirt and fucking shit.  I had to afford my E-tickets back in the old days.  The whole time, yeah.  You actually had tickets.  I had to buy those tickets.  Then you'd go home with the dumb A's and B tickets because they stunk.  Not us.  We always went on, if you had wings.  If you had wings?  Because it was like an A-ticket or not A-ticket, E-ticket or whatever.  What was it?  A was the worst.  A would get you on the carousel and like into the snow white part of the castle thing. 
[01:43:00]  And then if you had wings, which was like Eastern Airlines presents.  Oh, I always liked.  If you had wings.  I always liked Monsanto into the atom.  With a carousel of progress.  Yes, carousel of progress.  Now is the time.  Now is the best.  And there's like old white people sitting around talking about how good shit used to be.  That was great.  The carousel of progress.  Especially the part where one of the employees got stuck in the gears that ran the thing.  And was crushed to death.  Did that happen? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Some girl was working there.  Is this like the Dollar More A-Rod thing?  Or is this true?  No, this is true.  It happened?  Yeah.  I know a lot about Disney deaths.  I'm fascinated by them.  Like the one where the rope snapped.  Oh, snapped on the Columbia.  Took the dude off.  And some Asian guy and his wife are standing there waiting for the Columbia to come in.  That big pirate ship that goes along with the Tom Sawyer paddle boat.  One of the most boring attractions in all of anything.  The second you get on, you look around and go, oh, there's Tom Sawyer Island.  There's this.  Pirates of the Caribbean.  There's the Haunted Mansion.  How much longer is this still? 
[01:44:00]  Were they going to pedal around this goddamn lagoon?  And then you see, you know, you hear, hi, hi, hi, hi.  And you see these bad animatronic Indians because they've got to be left out in the weather.  So they can't be like the good Pirates of the Caribbean ones.  Just horrible.  Cheapskate.  And then once you got to the sea ticket, then you just started getting some good things.  And then the E was Space Mountain and Haunted Mansion.  When did they get rid of the ticket system?  That's been a long time already.  They went to the pay one price. 
[01:44:30]  That's one of the things you've seen come and go in your lifetime.  I know, yeah.  Like tickets at Disneyland.  Tickets.  Disney tickets.  And they were just, they were pretty inexpensive back then.  Another cheesy ride was that Captain Nemo, the submarine thing.  Yeah, 20,000 leagues under the sea.  See people walking above you.  Yeah, that was like, you look out the window and be like, oh.  You can make this a little deeper.  Plastic fish.  But then if you look up, you just see like some woman eating a baby stroller.  A fucking corn dog.  It's like, great.  It's really taking me out of this whole thing. 
[01:45:00]  You couldn't suspend the window of disbelief or whatever.  You were like, I don't buy it.  I'm not believing that word, actually.  Just because I see a tentacle.  Don't mean it or Johnny Squid here.  And they just did the bubbles in front of the window.  Every time they were changing the scene, they were like, we're going deeper.  And they just put bubbles.  And you could see through the bubbles.  And you're like, we're not going deeper.  We're literally next to the other thing.  Ah, shit.  Fantastic.  A lot of fun.  I used to go there all the time when I was living in California.  Go there all the time just to fucking hang out. 
[01:45:30]  That was a place where you would hang out with your friends.  Yeah.  Disneyland.  One of my first dates with Jen, I took her to Disneyland.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of fun.  Fun date.  You get to do a lot of close to each other shit.  You get to show off kind of like, I've got a childish side.  But at the same time, you're like, let's fucking minis.  So, you know, you show you're whimsical and you show you've got an edge as well.  Take her on Mr. Toad's wild ride.  Because it would fling them into you a little bit.  Totally.  And then it takes them to hell.  Like, that ride's amazing.  It shows your whole life ends in hell. 
[01:46:00]  And then you come back into the park.  You die at the end of that ride.  You get blown up and you're burning in hell.  And then they're like, God, come again.  Hands up.  They smile.  They entered the ticket system in 82.  82.  Holy shit.  Wow, man.  Jesus.  Almost 30 years ago.  I bet if you had a few of those ticket books, you'd probably get, what, five bucks?  I bet you there is a collector's item.  There's probably...  A collector market of some sort.  Definitely, yeah.  Well, one of the things that's insanely popular there is they've got this pin thing, like collectible 
[01:46:30]  pins.  These Cloyzone pins, I think that's the word.  And you can go up to any employee at the park and if they have pins on them, you can be like,  I'll trade you.  They have to trade.  They have to trade you?  Yeah, it's forced trading.  Wow, that sucks.  Yeah, so you've got a pin you like commemorating the death of your father.  Yeah.  And some motherfucker comes up to you and is like, I'm going to trade you for a Pluto.  You're like, here you go.  Oh, fuck.  You have to do it.  You know the employees put the shit pins on, though, in the morning.  Totally.  Like, fuck this, man.  They keep the good shit at home.  Dukakis 88.  It's a hot pin.  I don't like your flair. 
[01:47:00]  You know, they also have a...  It's the only place that serves booze in Disneyland and it's a private club.  Club 21 or 22 or whatever it is.  Yeah, Club 22, I think it is.  And it's right near the Pirates of the Caribbean.  And it costs, like, thousands of dollars to become a member.  You can't even do that anymore.  Rogan texted me once.  He's like, I'm going in.  Really?  He got in.  He said it was boring.  There's nothing...  I would assume it's like...  It makes it seem like once you get behind these doors, you could fuck any mermaid in 
[01:47:30]  this new world.  That's it, man.  But once you get inside, it's literally a restaurant.  You could have a beer.  That's better.  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  They only accept corporate applications now?  I'm a corporation.  What about me?  Sweet.  I can do it if I want.  But I don't want to.  They're like, we remember you with the t-shirt.  Get the fuck out.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait a minute.  You're the t-shirt asshole.  We know you like sex.  And you like to wear it across your chest.  And I do love the security detail that they got there.  Mickey Mouse security.  Right.  They're like, if you try to jump the turnstile for the monorail when they used to have turnstiles, 
[01:48:00]  now you can just go on the fucking thing.  But we actually tried doing that once.  Getting in because we didn't have any tickets.  And Disney security comes up.  They're everywhere.  They come out.  They're like Secret Service.  Or they dress like.  Like Mickey.  Mickey.  Very awkward.  You could run away from him really fast.  To flopping his big dumb feet.  Hey, Kev.  There it is.  This is the actual pictures of the place.  It's a shame.  The internet has demystified even this.  You could have literally been like, you know what happens in that fucking sick club? 
[01:48:30]  Babies get eaten.  And they show you the place and it's just a restaurant.  Some crazy cult.  You wear black hoods.  A lot of chanting.  It's like the Kubrick movie, man.  There were two more trailers during the Super Bowl.  What else?  Did they show Captain America?  Thank you.  Captain America.  How was that?  And Thor.  Well, they all looked amazing.  Trailers always look good, right?  Very true.  You know anything about those two movies?  I mean, I want to see Thor. 
[01:49:00]  I had really no interest.  Then I was at Comic Con last year and I saw a trailer for it.  And I think it looks like Kenneth Brown had done a pretty good job.  I mean, especially considering it's Thor.  He played Frankenstein, right?  Kenneth Brown, he directed it.  Oh, okay.  And I think he was in it, right?  Like if Robert De Niro played Frankenstein, I think he played the other guy.  De Niro.  Fucking hell.  Remember?  He was the monster.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Bah.  Bah.  Fire.  What else did I see? 
[01:49:30]  I didn't see the Captain America trailer.  Yeah, no.  And I didn't see Super 8.  How did the Super 8 trailer look?  Super 8 looks really cool.  They were shooting literally where we were shooting Red State.  They were down like the road from us.  We could see them.  They were 100 feet building a train station with an overturned train or something like that.  Yeah, that's how the movie starts.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  But we were saying, why wouldn't they try to escape when the train was just going down  the tracks?  Whatever that thing is inside the Air Force car.  Because it was probably...  The train had to crash for now the alien to start pounding on the side.  It was sleeping. 
[01:50:00]  And how do you know it's an alien?  Oh, true.  That's true.  Spoiler alert.  I know it's an Air Force train truck.  What the fuck is he?  It's an Air Force train truck.  Same thing.  Yeah, that's right.  Maybe it was locked up really good with high tensile steel.  I guess they'll explain.  How long was the trailer?  Was it 30 seconds?  A minute?  Probably a minute, right?  They might have went a little longer because they were trailers.  They look good.  A lot of action.  That is good, man.  J.J. Abrams knows how to quietly make a movie without spoiling it and dropping it on people.  Like when they showed the first teaser for Super 8, they hadn't shot anything except that 
[01:50:30]  teaser.  So they work far out.  They start their marketing before they even start rolling.  That's kind of smart, right?  One thing that nailed Star Trek, I fucking loved Star Trek.  That was great.  He did a killer job.  Amazing fucking rebooting Star Trek.  First of all, you got your work cut out for you because there's so many Star Trek geeks  that will not accept anything that isn't good.  True.  And a whole new cast like that.  The way they matched up the characters were amazing.  I thought fucking McCoy, the guy that played McCoy, fucking looked and acted like young 
[01:51:00]  McCoy or whatever.  It was fantastic.  Carl Urban.  Was that his name?  Is that who he was?  He's playing Judge Dredd now.  Oh, really?  What are they?  Another Judge Dredd movie?  Yeah, but this time they keep the helmet on him.  I didn't even know the helmet came off.  In the comics, he always has the helmet on, never takes it off.  And then they made the movie with Stallone.  The first five minutes, he took the helmet off.  And everybody who was ever a fan of that book was like, what the fuck?  Bullshit!  I didn't break the law.  I didn't break the law.  I didn't break the law.  That was the whole movie.  I didn't break the law.  I didn't break the law. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, the Star Trek thing.  Someone pointed this out.  And I didn't even notice, but once they pointed it out, now, and I've watched the movie probably  eight fucking times.  I love it.  But I can't now not notice this.  J.J. Abrams loves lens flare.  Yeah, he does.  Oh, my goodness.  He likes to cross over the light.  Every single thing had that nice neon blue and the red, orange, circular lens flare.  Every time the camera moved, lens flare sweeping everywhere. 
[01:52:00]  What is lens flare?  Lens flare is when a light catches the camera lens.  And, like, for example, if you ever watched the X-Files, they would do it a lot.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They always had flashlights, and they would go right across the lens.  They would almost go in the opposite direction of the light.  The flare would go.  A lot in space.  Yeah, that's lens flare.  That's a lot of lens flare.  Is that a goof?  Yes.  It's got to be.  Of course it is.  He put two in his eyes, too, there.  That is pretty funny.  Other people found out and kind of ran out of it. 
[01:52:30]  And that's the thing.  Now, a lot of people add them in posts.  Like, it used to be an accident, and it would be something you'd go out of your way to avoid.  And now people add it in posts.  Like, let's add some lens flare.  You know what?  I always loved watching old Columbo episodes.  Whenever they had headlights going down the road, there'd be that second set of headlights  that slowly merged across the first.  It's like they can't.  We don't know how to do this.  It's just a reflection in the fucking lens.  We can't figure it out.  Can't take it out in post because it's 1973.  That motherfucker who played Kirk was genius.  That dude was fine. 
[01:53:00]  Really fucking, really good.  He had the whole Kirk fucking swagger.  He did the impossible.  He invoked Kirk without invoking Shatner.  Yeah, yeah.  That's amazing.  He got the, and the last scene when he crosses his legs like Kirk did, like a girl, and just  goes, bones.  It was a perfect Kirk.  But you're not telling Kevin what took you out of the movie.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know if he's ever heard this one before. 
[01:53:30]  Well, that was Spock.  Well, Leonard Nimoy.  Yeah.  Spock.  In the future, that far in the future, you would think they would come up with something  better than bad dentures that aren't staying in your mouth.  Right.  Because he was, I shall be, and all, I have been, and always will be your friend.  Yeah.  Give me one second.  So, the ship was coming through his time.  He's trying to talk over dentures, and I was just like, oh, God, they would do something 
[01:54:00]  about that, wouldn't they?  It will be, and will always be, your friend.  Your adhesive.  Yeah, go to Rigel 7 and find something sticky.  He'd suck.  Are they going to make more movies?  Yeah, man.  Definitely.  Obviously, right after Super 8, they're heading into the next Star Trek.  That's a complete franchise, man.  I wasn't a Trekkie at all, but I fucking loved that movie.  It's so...  Fucking loved it.  They did the impossible, man. 
[01:54:30]  They rebooted it where you were like, oh, they honored the original, and they're taking  us in a new direction, and I have no regrets whatsoever.  And they're rebooting Spider-Man, right?  Yeah, they're shooting it right now.  That's why, though.  Yeah.  It seemed to be successful.  Because who has it?  Sony?  Sony had the rights to it.  Right.  And if Sony didn't make a new Spider-Man movie within a certain period of time, the rights  revert back to Marvel Studios, and so Spider-Man would now go to Disney, which owns Marvel.  Right.  So rather than let that happen, Sony's like, we're going to exercise our option to make 
[01:55:00]  another Spider-Man film.  And rather than keep going with the Raimi ones, because they caught a lot of crap for the  third one, I guess, they decided to just reboot, relaunch.  Which was kind of controversial when they announced it, but now everyone's like, yeah, I guess there's  It didn't seem like enough years went by.  No, I mean, not at all.  I would love a reboot of a movie that just came out.  Next year, we're rebooting Red State.  Yeah.  You cast and rebooting the whole movie.  Just recast it, reshoot it with new people and shit.  We're rebooting.  Movie just came out. 
[01:55:30]  What the fuck?  You excited about the Red State thing at Radio City, or what?  Yeah, I am.  Of course you are.  We kicked off our tour March 5th.  Coopersdale.com.  To Coopersdale.com for tickets.  We start March 5th, and we end in Los Angeles on April 9th.  And the rest of the time, we're just between all bunch of dates across the country, Boston,  Chicago.  You're going to fly, take a bus?  I was going to bus, man.  And then we were looking at the schedule, and some of the dates were iffy as to whether  or not I'd be pulling in right at the moment we start screening.  So I think there's going to be some flying as well. 
[01:56:00]  I don't think we're going to go.  I think we're going to go coach.  You're digging the bus.  I love my bus, but at the same time, there ain't no plan on the world.  They can't let me on now.  That's true.  I dropped 65 pounds.  So I'm like, maybe I'll take some flights as well to keep it moving along smoothly.  But yeah, I'm excited, man.  March 5th, we do Radio City Music Hall.  That's the first date.  And it's a barn, and we will never fucking fill it in a million years because it's like 6,000.  People need to know, you're going to be doing something before the film.  You've got other guys from the film.  A jump butt. 
[01:56:30]  Well, on that screening, yeah, that one's going to be our premiere, essentially.  So the whole cast and crew will be there.  But at all the screenings afterwards, I'm going to get up and do a Q&A and sit there and talk.  So if the movie's 90 minutes, then we'll probably do 90 minutes of Q&A afterwards.  So it's like two shows.  That's cool, man.  I've got to kiss your ass for a second.  I gave my brother tickets to see you out on Long Island.  Did he go out to the Westbury Music Fair?  He fucking loved it.  Oh, that was a good show.  He's now a huge fan.  He loved the fucking show.  It was good.  Yeah, it was a really good night, man. 
[01:57:00]  That's my favorite part of this gig is getting up and doing Q&A.  You can spin a yarn.  You really can.  Yeah, I like telling stories.  Kevin can talk.  He can tell a great story.  Obviously, they're going to ask whatever they want.  Totally.  You don't have any questions set up.  Oh, God, no.  And here's my feeling.  For the last few years, people have been...  It all started...  I used to do a show of the movie and then do Q&A afterwards.  And then I was like, people coming to see the movie had already seen it on video and  stuff.  So I was like, why are we wasting time watching these movies again?  Let's get rid of the movie and just go right to Q&A. 
[01:57:30]  And now I've kind of come full circle where we're going to start by showing the movie and  then doing a Q&A afterwards.  And it's like, yeah, it could be about Red State, but it could be about anything as well.  Right, right.  Yeah, I saw...  It's fun, though.  Full Metal Jacket.  It's a fucked up movie.  I want you guys to see it.  It's...  I can't wait.  You guys are going to be ready to see it.  We got a copy on you?  No.  Yeah, right.  You guys are going to see it at the theater.  I got a kid now, man.  I need a coffee.  That's true.  I'm seeing all my movies at home now.  It's awesome.  You don't go out at all?  It's tough.  It's fucking tough, you know? 
[01:58:00]  Screw that.  I've been only in the biggest city in the world with every movie theater.  I can understand how...  Well, we kind of blew it.  My kid's now nine months.  Up until about a month ago, I could have went to any movie theater because he sleeps solid  for two, three hours.  I took my kid to Fight Club when she was...  Yeah, I'm out of that stage now.  But we could have strapped him on and seen every movie, and we just didn't do it, unfortunately.  But Roland's giving me every movie.  Sweet.  Exit through the gift shop.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a cool flick.  You liked it?  Yeah, it was a cool flick, man.  Yeah, we were supposed to have the guy in on Friday.  Banksy? 
[01:58:30]  No, of course not.  Right, right.  How would you know?  You might have Banksy, and you wouldn't even know.  I know.  What's your take on that movie?  It's cool.  I think it's cool.  I mean, I think that's art.  I think it's just like the idea...  Do you think it was what it was, or was there more going on?  Like, Banksy set up this whole fucking thing?  I think it's...  Did you think the moment you start pulling apart, it's just like, oh, the magic starts  going away.  You just kind of take it for what it is.  Like, do you see Catfish yet?  No.  What's that about?  Catfish is this documentary.  It's pretty interesting.  I watched it a couple weeks ago, and it's these...  It starts off... 
[01:59:00]  These two filmmakers live with this one guy, and the one dude, the brother of one of the  filmmakers, he's a photographer here in New York, and he took this picture that went  on some, like, giveaway magazine or paper, something like that, of two dancers in an Alvin  Ailey-like pose outside.  Right.  Then he gets a letter and a package, and basically, there's this girl somewhere in the middle  of the country, I think it's Michigan, who took his photograph and turned it into a painting. 
[01:59:30]  So the dude was like, wow, this is pretty badass, and whatnot.  He starts a relationship with the chick's mom, and she explains that this little girl  is, like, insanely gifted at art.  She's really celebrating her community, one of these outsider art people and stuff.  He sparks up a relationship with the kid.  He keeps sending her pictures.  He takes to New York.  She paints them, sends them back, knows her mother, knows, like, she's got a sister.  I guess the mother has a sister.  He starts a relationship with online and stuff.  He knows all these people that he meets via this girl through Facebook and all these different 
[02:00:00]  social media outlets.  And then at a certain point, she starts sending them songs.  She's like, hey, man, I'll record a song for you guys.  What do you want to hear?  And they would say a title, and, like, five minutes later, she'd send an MP3.  And they're like, oh, my God, this sounds amazing.  And then they're like, wait, it sounds like there's a club in the background.  And then they start Googling, like, the song, and they found it on YouTube being sung by  somebody else entirely.  And they're like, this is weird.  And then they start piecing it.  They start looking into the story and unraveling it slowly.  And I don't want to spoil the movie at all, because that's what it's kind of all about. 
[02:00:30]  But they go on a road trip.  They go on an audio trailer.  They go on a road trip.  If I can only sell my movies.  They go on a road trip to go find this chick and her family, because the mom's going, like,  we're just buying this gallery space.  It used to be an old Sears here in town.  And now we're renting it out.  We had our opening last night.  And they, you know, jump on Google, and they find the address of this building.  It's still for sale.  It's been vacant for months.  So they're like, something's wrong here. 
[02:01:00]  They all get in the car, and they head out to Michigan, and what they find out there  is pretty astounding.  And the movie is, it's one of these movies where it really, afterwards, you start having  discussions with people about, was that right?  Was that not right?  Who's right?  Who's wrong?  But it's very, it's, I don't want to give it away, but it's, when they start digging,  everything starts coming loose.  Like, all of a sudden, you realize that, like, all these people that he's known and met through  this little girl are probably just one person. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, shit.  It's fucking mind-bending.  I gotta see it.  It's a good watch.  It's a pretty good watch.  It's called Catfish?  Catfish.  There are some, there are some movies that you watch that are good movies, but you just  don't think about them, or talk about them, or anything, after you're done seeing it.  It's just, you saw it, and you're done.  That was good.  Yeah, that was good.  Good movie.  Yeah.  And then other movies that might not even be that good, but there's something about them  where you just, you're on the internet, fucking checking shit.  You want to read about what that was, other people's opinions on what they thought this 
[02:02:00]  thing was.  Like Lolita.  Do you think that was wrong at all?  I say no.  I just saw Adam Sandler's new movie.  That's exactly what I was doing, man.  Which one?  Which one?  Just go with it.  You went to, did you see it on tape?  And I had to go on the internet and get more info on this movie.  Did you go out to see it?  Nah, look.  That means yes.  No, no, no, no.  That means yes.  No, Roland said, I went to a screening, not Sonya.  So you did go out of your house to watch a movie. 
[02:02:30]  Oh yeah, you know what?  Good point.  Very good point.  You're right.  But it was for the show.  If you'll make a trip for that dude, you're mine.  You're absolutely right.  No.  How was the movie?  No, the wife stayed home with the kid and I, you know what?  It's a rom-com.  It's not going to hurt anybody.  It is what it is.  As far as that goes, they did a good job.  And we have Brooklyn Decker coming in actually from the movie.  She's the hot blonde.  You've seen the commercials.  She comes out of the water in the bikini with the big jugs.  She's coming in to say hi to us today.  Jesus.  Big jugs?  That's why I went and saw the movie, so we could get some of these people in. 
[02:03:00]  Right on.  Look at you.  That's what I'm telling people.  Networking and shit.  It's quid pro quo.  And I turned, I changed my opinion on Jennifer Aniston.  She's so fucking hot.  What do you mean?  You were an anti-Aniston?  I thought her pussy smelled.  I hear that from so many people.  It's crazy.  I think we started, I really think we started, because it has a little bit of a buzz now.  And I like to think me and Ann and Jimmy started this one.  That's why she doesn't have a guy.  We think her pussy smells really bad.  Like she can't keep a man, but she's hot.  She seems cool. 
[02:03:30]  She has that.  So we thought it had to be something hygienic.  I would imagine that pretty girls are high maintenance to begin with.  Yeah.  You add super stardom and you're one of the friends and all that stuff.  Makes it tough.  I think that's probably.  I would imagine that's tough to, you're kind of sharing a relationship with the career  as well.  Do you think the guy would be like, oh, I can't fucking deal with being with a girl that has  this type of fame and notoriety?  Probably.  It has a lot to do.  It has to be a lot of insecurity. 
[02:04:00]  They just talked about recently that every, well not every, almost every best actress winning  Oscar of the last, you know, what, 60 years, 50 years, whatever it is, or I think it's  63% of them of their marriages end in divorce within a year after they win the award and  stuff.  Who else was it?  Sandra Bullock?  Sandra Bullock recently.  Kate Winslet.  Before that, she was married to the director guy and then he, they split up.  Tatum O'Neill.  That's a child. 
[02:04:30]  But apparently, yeah, I guess when they win that award, a lot of the boyfriends or husbands  can't handle the success.  Looking at that, just looking at it on the mantle.  That phallic thing sitting there, that golden cock.  It's just like, this is way better than you, buddy.  That big, fat, golden cock.  That is so much bigger than yours.  This is all I need in life.  I'd like to thank the Academy for this fat, golden cock.  You're just part of a long list of people she thanked.  I would be the opposite, man.  I'd be one of those dudes who's just like, did you see my lady win an Oscar? 
[02:05:00]  I'd be eating out off that for 20 years, man.  I was like, hey, my lady won an Oscar.  Give us a nice table.  Whenever you go out, bam, on a table.  You know what this is?  This is an Oscar.  I didn't win it.  She did.  Hostess at the restaurant, right at our little fucking podium.  Bam, table.  Life is great.  What kind of table does this get us?  That is an Oscar.  Yeah, but if you're the husband, it's still annoying, though.  It's like, yeah, it's great, but does that mean you're finally going to take it in the ass?  Nobody cares about your fucking dumb statue.  Blow me without scraping my dick with your teeth.  I'll give you a statue. 
[02:05:30]  We should break, because I think Piers is going to come in here soon.  Piers?  We should get a break in before he shows up.  He's the new Larry King.  I was supposed to be on his show.  That's why I came out East, to be on his show.  Oh, shit, what happened?  What happened?  I was supposed to be on today at 5, and I just saw that it's somebody else.  They said next week, because he does it out of Los Angeles.  I know what it is.  They're doing a lot of Egypt.  Because Anderson Cooper got punched in the face.  They want him on his show today, because he's coming back from Egypt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everybody that got some money.  Oh, so you're doing Piers Morgan's show.  Yeah, that's why I was coming East, to do the Piers Morgan show. 
[02:06:00]  But then at the last minute, they're like, with this Egypt thing, then you do it next week or something.  I actually canceled that, because I felt they disrespected you.  I'm like, fuck you, I ain't doing it.  I love you, man.  Bad boy, Kev.  Good looking.  Bad boy, playing a goalie.  He is, man.  That's going to be awesome.  All right, we've got Kevin Smith.  More with Kevin Smith.  Of course, Red State, March 5th at Radio City Music Hall.  Go to coopersdell.com for tickets.  And we really have to buy a ticket, huh?  Fuck yeah.  We have to buy a ticket this time.  Yeah.  I got no company behind me. 
[02:06:30]  This is all me.  You should see.  It'd be an honor.  Even coming out here, I was like, we've got to stay at a Sheridan or something.  Yeah, no more Four Seasons.  It's not even about the money.  It's like, how do I even buy a ticket?  Can I give you money, you fucking fool?  Can I give you money and you just hand me a ticket?  Opie just wants to pay you money right now.  I'll get you some cash.  I'll get you some tickets.  Make it easy for me.  All right.  More with Kevin Smith, Piers Morgan, and then, of course, Brooklyn Decker.  Very busy show.  For the Virus Sirius XM, this is the Opinion Entry Show. 
[02:07:00]  Opinion Entry.  Opinion Entry.  Opinion Entry.  We've got Kevin Smith in the studio, and we're going to have Piers Morgan in a few minutes here.  I think he's wrapping up with Howard and coming down the hall to say hi to us.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  That's another big booking.  He's, yeah, he's topical.  And then we've got Brooklyn Decker, who's doing the Morning Joe right now with Joe Scarborough. 
[02:07:30]  Morning Joe.  She's hanging with the boys talking, I don't know, whatever they talk about on that show.  We've got to look at her.  You know, we've got a good look at her.  Not for nothing, but there's a big guest already here, motherfucker.  Absolutely.  I certainly said that, Kevin.  You did.  You did.  You were very kind.  Yes.  Club Soda Kenny.  Yes.  He said, guess that big dope.  Sorry, Kenny.  You following the Egypt thing?  You got a take on that?  I don't even know.  I probably should ask that.  No particular take.  Do you have a take?  I just love watching it. 
[02:08:00]  I love watching that type of TV.  I love that show.  It's a great show.  It's a great show.  It's amazing to watch.  I saw a description the other day where they were saying that two groups were hurling  rocks at one another from behind cars like a snowball fight.  Yeah.  Which sounded kind of charming until somebody gets hit by a fucking rock in the head.  We did this bit Friday.  Did you?  No.  Oh, yeah.  We talked about how cool snowball fights and dirt bomb fights were great until you got 
[02:08:30]  hit with that dumb rock.  Until somebody had to ruin it with a rock.  And then the game changed.  Who's a rock in that one?  Yeah, you fuck.  And I've seen, I saw where they actually pile up rocks, like little ammo piles, these guys  in Egypt.  And I saw these rocks.  They're not like, and I know getting hit by any rock in the head has to really hurt.  But you know, here in New York and stuff, you get the, it's pretty much a round rock.  Right.  It ain't that there.  No.  These are these sharp, jagged, like clumps of.  It looks like somebody took a giant stone in a quarry, shattered it. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, shattered it.  And then gave out the pieces to throw.  Exactly.  The rocks are coming from ruins.  Of course they're going to be all.  Ancient friggin' rock on a pyramid rock.  You see all the helmets they're making to make sure they don't get it?  Oh, you're finding it there?  Yeah.  Breadman?  Breadman?  Dude, breadman rules.  Breadman is the best.  You haven't seen this yet, Kevin?  No.  There's a whole montage of guys that, look, they don't want to get hit in the head with  rocks, but they don't have fucking hockey helmets there.  He's tied water bottles.  That's smart, man.  That's kind of genius. 
[02:09:30]  I'll get a tiny URL going.  What?  I'll get a tiny URL.  Yeah, please.  Yeah, I'll tweet that a little later.  But the guy who made a helmet out of bread.  I want to see.  Classic.  Can you find that?  It gets better as you go, as I've found, so I just kind of like looking at all of that.  Yeah, that guy's got a box on his head.  That guy has a rock.  He has a rock on his head.  Doesn't he know energy will transfer through a hard object like that?  Looks like he has an old school toothache.  Yeah, he does.  A cartoon toothache.  A cartoon toothache. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you, yeah.  He's got a bucket, man.  I just put a bucket on his head.  Buckethead lives.  Buckethead.  That guy's got a pot.  This dude's out of a kid's court, too.  He's literally got a pot.  These were actually taken two years ago.  Those are just hats that they wear in Egypt.  That is like a little rascal's helmet.  Look, they look silly, but they're pretty smart.  I don't see the other guys in the background with their hats on.  Smart would be going home so you don't get hit by anything.  Yeah, that's true.  This guy's holding some kind of...  Have you ever wanted freedom so bad that you strapped red to your head?  Are you guys ready?  Yeah, I love this picture. 
[02:10:30]  Wait, wait, let me see.  What is that?  That one looks like the top of Brett Favre's dick in that picture.  It's just an awful dickhead.  What is that?  It looks like a wok or something.  I don't know what it is.  It's probably some kind of ancient cooking thing.  Whatever it is, it looks like a rock would hit it and it would shatter.  It would shatter.  The idiot probably...  It's probably priceless.  Something he stole out of the museum.  Here it comes.  Is this the one?  Breadhead?  This is the one that everyone's talking about.  All right.  The guy taped bread to his head. 
[02:11:00]  It was Princess Leia.  He had no idea, man, what he was stepping into history with this accessory.  Look at that.  Breadhead is the good new guy that's ending up everywhere?  The first thing I did this morning...  Oh, yeah.  This thing is everywhere.  ...was I made one of those demotivational posters.  Yeah.  You can make yourself.  And I just cropped him and the title was Brain Food and then under it just said, you're doing  it wrong.  So, that was the first thing I had to do this morning.  You could roto him out really easy.  What do they have over there?  President?  Is it a president or a premier?  Yeah, president. 
[02:11:30]  This dude could probably run for president on this picture alone.  Just that picture.  I'd trust this guy.  Trust me, Durand-de-Country!  He ran into battle with nothing but bread taped to his head.  It's fucking smart, though, man.  You can hit by the head into bread.  The bread will protect you.  Yeah.  When you're hungry, you can eat the bread.  You can eat the bread.  And it's also a conversation piece.  When the revolution's over, you got lunch.  You know what, though?  You got to start picking strategically.  You don't take from the top where you might get some damage.  You start with the ear guards he's got. 
[02:12:00]  It's like, all right, I could get hit with a rock in the ear.  He eats from here down below.  Yeah, yeah, really low.  I don't need to protect my...  He does.  Somebody said Princess Leia.  I don't need to protect my...  Yeah, Princess Leia.  He's got a Princess Leia thing going on.  Instead of Biali's, he's got...  Looks like buns.  Breadhead.  And he's...  Look, he's psyched.  He's in the battle.  This picture is everywhere.  He's the man.  So, I don't know.  I just love watching these big, over-the-top events when they...  I want to Photoshop him into something.  Yeah, it's so usable.  He's so easy to cut out, too. 
[02:12:30]  Like, he's so...  The lines are very defined on him.  Yeah, it's pretty clean.  You could definitely pop him out.  Was he watching the Super Bowl?  Yeah, I was about to say he should be on the field.  He's doing the touchdown.  Touchdown!  Perfect!  He's calling a touchdown.  Do it!  Yeah, we'll tweet this fucking website.  I didn't know there was a whole bunch of pictures on one site, then.  Yeah, I found it this morning.  I'll make it tell you.  Yeah, that's cool.  That's great.  Hey, we talked about it a second ago, but your goalie, man, got fucking...  DPH, bro?  Decked, dude. 
[02:13:00]  I'm so...  Decked by a penguin of all people.  Not even the main penguin.  The backup penguin.  I've got his name.  The backup penguin.  Anderson, I think, or one of them had made, isn't it?  I don't remember now.  Mr. Anderson.  I was telling you.  Mr. Anderson.  But see, it fractured his cheekbone or his face, and he's out six weeks, and...  That fight...  So wait...  I don't want to defend him, but it looks like it was more of a forearm, possible elbow.  So it wasn't fist on cheek.  It looked more like kind of an MMA hit or something.  I don't know.  And for those who don't watch hockey, a goalie fight's very rare.  Yeah.  Yeah, because what problem could they have with the guy that's all the way on the other end 
[02:13:30]  of the ice?  I never understood that.  But it's just what...  If you get caught up in the, like, our team versus your team, then every once in a while  you'll see goalies drop helmets, gloves, sticks, and skate toward one another.  And everyone goes apeshit, because it never happens.  You're like, ah!  We're here and it's going to happen.  And this fight lasted fucking...  A second.  Maybe.  More time to get to center right so they're going to fight.  Pretty much.  And they get there, grip one another, the penguin dude threw his fucking punch, and DiPietro 
[02:14:00]  went down.  Right down.  And then, like Anthony said, then the guy was cocked, like, I'm going to give you a couple  more shots.  And then he felt sorry for him.  And then he pulls his arm up, and then he gives it like the...  And then they show the penguins bench, and everyone's laughing.  I'm like, ah, fucking mortified.  Yeah, when he came back to the bench, everyone's patting him on the back laughing, like, oh,  you fucking...  The other goalie was just like, you lucky son of a bitch.  The only defense I had was I just started tweeting videos of Billy Smith beating the shit out of  people.  I'm like, oh, yeah, well, Billy Smith slashing Gretzky across the fucking ankles and whatnot. 
[02:14:30]  Was he the dirtiest goalie of all time?  Oh, definitely.  I've had this discussion with people.  I don't know about dirtiest, but he was definitely...  He pushed the job and was just like, look, it's my crease.  He would slash people.  I will do what I want in my crease.  He didn't give a fuck.  He would fight anybody.  Fling his stick across the crease.  He was a badass.  He was truculent.  He was surly, man.  Entertaining.  And you're going to have a goalie fight in your movie, right?  Goalie, goalie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  You're going to have to skate out to him.  You have to.  I don't want to fight.  You have to.  That'll be your thing.  I want to talk.  Your thing is you don't want to fight.  I don't want to. 
[02:15:00]  I don't like violence.  You throw up, he goes to punch you, and you immediately throw up on the ice.  We've got a hockey fan that wants in bed.  Jim in Pittsburgh.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, it's Tim.  Hey, how are you guys today?  All right, man.  Hang in with Kevin Smith.  I was at the Penguins game on Wednesday night when D.P. Adrian got knocked out, and it was  a punch.  I mean, it was D.P. Adrian came skating out smiling.  They showed it slow motion on the big screen.  Can they file assault charges for that, though?  They were saying in sports he could file assault charges for fights like that. 
[02:15:30]  Well, I mean, Marty McSurley got charged with assault when he hit Donald.  Brashear, right, in the back of the head, and he went down.  Yeah, he tapped him on the back of his wall, hit him, tapped him, whatever, and Brashear  kind of went back without a helmet came off, and he bashed his head on the ice.  And so Marty McSurley, I believe he got charged with assault or something like that.  But in this case, he can't really charge with assault.  Everybody's fighting.  They brawl.  That's part of the game.  D.P. Adrian was just so frustrated.  He said, all right, I'll fucking fight, and then he can't even do that properly.  Six weeks.  So they shattered. 
[02:16:00]  What is it?  They fractured his jaw?  It was, I don't know if it's the jaw or the cheekbone or the face.  I don't know.  I can't say.  Danny keeps bobbing other pictures of bread.  Bread man?  The bread head?  It's everywhere.  Bread helmet, guys.  Bread helmet, Egyptian.  Bread helmet, Egyptian.  If you want to check it out online.  This is the dude you guys need in gold.  He looks like he can take a punch in the head.  Yeah, he can.  With his bread pads.  Is that the same guy?  Yeah.  He has different bread helmets?  He's got giant baguettes up his shins.  It's just a different angle.  He knows he's on to something, man.  Oh, he does.  He is the best. 
[02:16:30]  Look how angry he is.  He's just screaming with his bread on his head.  He's screaming for butter.  And it looks like it's not even taped.  It's like cellophane.  God bless them.  Yeah, they don't have any helmets, but they have a lot of saran wrap.  Yeah, saran wrap and various water bottles.  I don't know.  I'm thinking Mythbusters.  I want to see if they bust this myth.  Will a bread helmet actually protect you against a rock?  We're going to shoot a man with a .22 caliber bolt.  Isn't that great a .50 caliber would look bouncing off that fucking bread? 
[02:17:00]  Make it look like a jelly donut.  Someone on Instant Feedback, Breadman is the new Heineken looter.  The looter, yeah, the Heineken looter.  It's at the place of the Heineken looter.  Who is the Heineken looter?  That guy was in every Photoshop thing I've ever seen since Katrina.  He's one of the Katrina guys.  The Photoshop, they didn't even need to make sense.  As long as that guy was in it, it was funny.  It didn't matter.  This guy's rocking a fucking bucket of Heineken storm.  One of the worst disasters in America's history. 
[02:17:30]  He was like on the moon.  And it was funny.  It made no sense.  Why would he be on the moon?  He does.  He has a big bucket of Heineken.  He's just rocking the Heineken.  He said, fuck, man.  It's not going to spoil my day.  He's famous.  Yeah, he is.  That guy's famous.  Oh, you're a dumb computer.  Huh?  Did they track him down?  They should.  You think Kimmel would have done that?  That's a good question.  Yeah, I don't know.  Looter loves you.  They put his head on the Buddy Christ body.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, they did.  It's just crossed over into my world.  Looter loves you.  Yeah.  Look at him.  That guy is, he is styling. 
[02:18:00]  Look at all the Heineken's he's got.  That's a heavy bucket.  I mean, honestly, and he's got the water in the back pocket.  I'm with him, man.  You're knee deep, waist deep in all that water.  It's either time to drink or get stoned.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Hey, you still pot?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not now, but yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, not now, but I mean, you've lost.  If people are just turning in.  How do you handle that?  65 pounds, you've lost and still.  Piers is coming in.  We'll get back to that point in a second.  Oh, well.  Oh, look at ladies. 
[02:18:30]  Just put them where Danny's.  This one?  You want to get in this one?  No, no, sit, sit.  Hey, Piers, what's up?  How are you?  Good morning.  How are you doing?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Take a seat.  Contrary to popular belief, we are on the air.  And Kevin Smith.  People don't know this.  Kevin Smith to your left.  How are you?  Hey.  He was supposed to do your show tonight.  Yeah, we moved it to Los Angeles or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  And Jim Norton.  Hi.  How are you?  Nice to see you.  Anthony, Opie, Sam, who cares about it?  How's it been, man?  Taking over. 
[02:19:00]  It's been great.  It's, you know, when you take over a gig like the Larry King show, it's a pretty amazing  honor, a challenge.  I mean, you know, I've done about 15 shows.  I feel absolutely exhausted.  Sure.  And someone said to me, Larry did 7,000.  Get over yourself.  It's like, it's a very relentless pace, but it's been great fun.  I mean, Larry's been so nice to me about it all.  We missed Larry just because he was kind of messing up at the end there.  I know you're not going to say anything, Piers.  I understand.  So let us say it. 
[02:19:30]  He's one of our heroes.  It was fantastic TV that last year.  Got a bunch of things wrong, man.  Really was fun to watch.  And when we heard he was retiring, we were a little bummed.  We're happy for you, though.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Because it made for great morning radio, some of those clips.  Well, I'll try and keep you filled with mistakes.  Don't worry.  Are you going to do all pre-tapes or any political stuff like he did day of?  No, I mean, last week, every day was live on Egypt.  And then before that, we had a few pre-tapes, a few live shows.  I mean, I'm going to mix it all up because, you know, I like to keep it unpredictable. 
[02:20:00]  Some will be pre-taped.  Some will be low.  I like it when you pre-taped.  Let's say Oprah Winfrey.  We got it in the tape for about a week.  You can then start leaking stuff out everywhere.  And everyone's, you know, we're a huge audience because we already promote it.  So I'm not really sold on it has to be live for the sake of it.  Sometimes live's good, but other times it's good.  And I'm paying attention, and I am watching.  Oprah screwed you, too.  She had that half-sister thing in her back pocket.  I know.  And she doesn't give it to you on CNN.  No way, it gets worse.  The two interviews I did through December into January were Elton John, who forgot to tell me he was about to have a baby. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  Didn't even tell me he was pregnant.  And then I interviewed Oprah Winfrey.  And so I went back on her show last week, and I went, can I ask you one more question?  And she went, yeah.  I know it's a bit late because our interview's aired, but do you have any half-sisters called Patricia that I should know about?  You just forgot to tell me about Oprah?  That would have been a great first week for you if she gave you that news on your show.  You know what?  She got huge ratings for us anyway, so it was a great week.  But I didn't blame her.  If I had my own network, I'd hold something like that bad for it as well.  People are saying you were responsible for the whole Gervais controversy at the Golden Globes. 
[02:21:00]  That I was to blame?  That you actually leaked out that there was a problem between the production staff and him, and him being mean-spirited, and that nobody really did care backstage that it was you just fibbing.  No, no.  A, I never said it.  B, it's completely untrue.  But C, had I thought of it, I definitely would have done it.  Yeah.  Well, you got credit for it anyway, because that's what I read in a few things that they said you were responsible. 
[02:21:30]  You know, my view is the more mischief, the better.  You know, I subscribe to Oscar Wilde's great saying, if there's one thing worse than being talked about, it is not being talked about.  So, if people want to believe that kind of stuff, game on.  Yeah.  Do you think the media has gotten, because you were at the mail, and then there was pictures published that weren't, they turned out to be hoaxes.  Daily Mirror.  Right, I'm sorry, The Mirror.  Yeah.  Do you think it's gotten to a point where it's so competitive, there's so many, it's kind of gotten a bit tabloid, where everybody's just rushing to get it first, and it's not just, I mean, it's every outlet, it seems. 
[02:22:00]  Well, the problem now is that news is, you know, in the old days, you'd buy a newspaper to find out what had gone on.  Now, as you've, you know, everyone's got iPads and computers and stuff, we all know what's happening in real time.  I mean, I'm on Twitter feed with all these news organizations, that's all you need.  On your phone, if you want to know what's happening, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum, and it streams in.  So the old reason for newspapers has disappeared, and it makes news unbelievably fast now, and it's dangerous.  You're absolutely right to say that, because apart from anything else, technology is now so sophisticated, you can hoax anybody if you want to, with information, with pictures, with video. 
[02:22:30]  Everyone knows you can, and, you know, you guys know better than most.  You're in a studio where you can do whatever you like in here.  So it's become much harder for news organizations, generally, A, to compete, because news is just flashing around in real time, and B, because there's a lot of people out there that want to con you.  It's hard.  Didn't they used to lose, like, the news divisions always lost money years ago, and it seems like that, accepting that and going, well, news divisions are going to lose money has changed, and it became this, we have to get ratings.  Well, I think, look, I have two views about this. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, one is that, I think there was a bit of pomposity from news divisions in the past as well.  It's like, we are serious news, and the only news that matters to people is serious news.  I don't agree with that.  I don't think the only news that we all want to wake up to every day has to be involving famine, death, disaster, and war.  I just don't.  And I think that there's a healthy balance to be struck.  News is something that somewhere, it's a great quote that came out from, I think it was Lord Beaverbrook in England, who owned a lot of newspapers.  News is something that someone somewhere doesn't want published.  That's pretty much the yardstick. 
[02:23:30]  And, you know, a newspaper at its best, or any kind of news show, ought to always have that in mind.  Whatever it is, it's something that somebody somewhere is going to be a little bit annoyed about.  Then it's news, because then it's like, it's something out there that may have been suppressed otherwise.  I think it affects the, or at least it has affected the credibility of newsmen and newswomen,  because in the old days you had Walter Cronkite, and he was actually out there, not only broadcasting the news, but collecting the news. 
[02:24:00]  He was on site, and then he'd come back and write his stuff.  Let me defend my news people, because last week I think you saw American news anchors at their absolute best.  You had Anderson Cooper, Brian Williams, Katie Couric, Christian Amonpour, all these legendary names,  all in the field in Egypt, getting physically attacked.  And most of them, I mean, Anderson was attacked three times, and not just, you know, quietly tapped on the shoulder.  He was punched in the head ten times, his car was smashed in.  You know, this is a very, very dangerous environment.  I don't know how they do it. I couldn't do that. 
[02:24:30]  My brother's a British army colonel, done just on a seven-month tour of Afghanistan.  You know, he can do it.  But I can't do that kind of thing, and they are incredibly brave people.  And so they still do that.  And, you know, there's no more credible people to me than people like Anderson or Brian or Katie.  So I don't think we've lost that.  The thing that's changed, which, you know, people like Walter Cronkite never had to put up with, is the Internet.  And the Internet is now spewing out information at such a speed.  And it's very hard to disseminate real, proper, accurate news placed by good, responsible news organizations like CNN, for example, 
[02:25:00]  and the blogosphere, which is just spilling out a load of crap morning, noon, and night.  I think you get, for every one-part news, you get ten-part speculation because that seems to be what a lot of the news channels are doing.  And because of the Internet, you have to – people want an answer immediately.  That's what they want.  Well, people also just have to fill space immediately.  So you have people writing without even thinking about what they're writing.  We were just up at Sundance two weeks ago. 
[02:25:30]  I went up, and in the midst of a rather large, showy thing, I essentially said, hey, I'm going to keep my own movie,  not spend any money to release it, try to release it without spending any marketing.  That's it.  But I saw so many fucking pieces where, like, even in Entertainment Weekly, there was a dude that was just like,  if Smith does this, there's a good chance he'll become part of the evil empire he hates so much.  And I'm like, you didn't even think about what I fucking said.  Like, how is me taking my movie out by myself related whatsoever to fucking some corporation or evil empire? 
[02:26:00]  Like, they don't think –  Fuck you, evil empire.  Exactly.  They're just like, well, Kevin likes Star Wars.  People know Star Wars, and let's compare him to fucking Darth Vader somehow, even if it doesn't make sense.  Because next week, it won't matter.  Right, right.  That's kind of frustrating, man.  You're right.  There is a lot of, like, there's one-part news, like, ten-part fucking opinion.  Yeah, yeah.  Speculation and opinion.  People like us now, though, have options, like Twitter and stuff.  Yeah, we can go out there and spread our own truth.  And you can get out there, someone will spread some lie about you.  You can go straight on Twitter and say, somebody said this, here's the truth. 
[02:26:30]  So actually, you can control your own message much better than you used to be able to.  Yeah, yeah.  But the truth's never nearly as entertaining, though, as the lie they put out.  That's true.  So, you used to be a slave to message boards that were completely run and maintained by  other people who, whatever interest was theirs, that's what you had to deal with.  And by the way, if you ever saw these loonies, right, they'd be in some tiny dungeon, you  know, in the middle of nowhere.  Oh, that's not fair.  That's not fair.  Don't you fist pump.  Motherfuckers, that's an old, old stereotype, man. 
[02:27:00]  I've seen a lot of these cats.  They can get pussy.  They can fucking, they can be charming.  I mean, they're not like dudes dwelling or chicks dwelling in basements anymore.  I guess they could be if they wanted to.  Exactly.  If they lost 600 pounds and left their house.  They, uh, but they do, they tweet, it's a bit of a personal information.  Like, I had a relationship with Brooklyn Decker, and it's amazing.  It's like the way that was, it was kind of cartooned and parodied.  Well, first of all, we're going to talk about that.  I'm just trying to start a little buzz about myself.  I mean, I, I, I was furious when all the rumors about me and Scarlett Johansson hit the 
[02:27:30]  airway.  Yes.  Um, you know, it'd be wrong on me to try and deny that.  I think it's, it's not the kind of thing I'd talk about, but you know, you see how it  happens.  Yeah.  People listen to this, they get on Twitter, they say, Pierce and Scarlett Johansson, really?  And before we know it, I'll be denying it properly tomorrow.  And then you'll be like the man.  I like clearing up rumors that nobody has ever started.  Like, I did not fuck her.  Nobody fuck you did.  Exactly.  No one questioned it, ass.  So now how did you get, uh, how did you get the gig?  I mean, uh, Larry King, obviously. 
[02:28:00]  Well, a large amount of money had to change.  Ah, that's handy.  Uh, for me to them.  No, it was, um, it was, uh, I mean, Larry being there 25 years, I think he was looking  to, to sort of semi-retire done, as I say, 7,000 shows in 25 years, an incredible career.  And the ratings, as everybody knows, in primetime on CNN were, were not good.  And I think they were looking for a change.  And I, and I do a big interview show back in Britain, which I've done for a few years.  It's a big success.  And they got the tapes in of those interviews.  And they realized that I'm, you know, I'm pretty comfortable interviewing politicians and 
[02:28:30]  celebrities and all that kind of thing.  Um, and so we had a few more meetings.  And to my astonishment, you know, I first talked to CNN about doing one or two specials  with him.  Next thing I know, I'm, I'm being offered the Larry King slot, which was an incredible  thrill.  Well, I have a question for you about interviewing.  When you go into an interview, what is your mindset?  Like you, cause there really is an art to getting information out of people.  Well, I have to say my, my brother, uh, the army brother has a, uh, saying the seven P's,  which is prior planning and preparation prevent piss poor performance.  So unlike Larry, who's great genius, and he really was a genius, was better walk in without 
[02:29:00]  much preparation.  He didn't like to prepare too much and just have a conversation with people because he  was radio trained, actually.  You guys could do the same.  You wouldn't need to prepare much.  You could just, cause you're such good talkers.  You could just talk to people.  And you know, you could ask them three or four questions before you know it, you know who  they are and what they do.  Uh, and that was Larry's great gift was to have the art of a conversation.  I'm much more journalistic because of my background as a newspaper editor.  So I like to, you know, when I interview you, I'll know more about you than a, you'd like  me to, and B, than you probably know. 
[02:29:30]  That's impossible.  I'm so fucking candid here.  There's nothing out there that I'm like, how could you know that?  I'll be telling you shit there.  He wants it all out.  He'll be like, well, let's pull some of these pictures up.  I was like, fuck!  He did find some.  That's Photoshop!  Damn it!  But what do you think when you're about to ask a question?  Because sometimes we want to get information, but it's like, you do think like, oh, I want  the person to like me.  And I, it's embarrassing to admit that feeling that at times you have, like you don't want  to ask the question because you don't want them to get pissed off.  What is your thought process when you're going to ask something or go into an area that 
[02:30:00]  you know they don't want to go into?  Well, you can't go in with a sledgehammer and you have to be sensitive to the fact that  they may be, you know, touchy about this, as we would say back home, sort of in a little  bit edgy.  I think you have to tread cautiously.  I always try and treat people with respect, but I try and be very direct.  I mean, I think the thing that I do differently to Larry is maybe I might look someone straight  in the eye when it's a difficult moment and just ask them straight.  And often it gets the best answer.  Often the people, in the back of their minds, they're thinking, I don't want to go there,  but actually when they're actually confronted with it as a bald question, they often will 
[02:30:30]  start to talk about it.  But have you had publicists tell you, all right, this is off limits, don't mention, you  know, this subject?  They do, but I would say, I would say, okay, well, let's just, we'll test the water, you  know?  We'll test the water.  And so I have George Clooney on.  And of course, and always people are saying, don't get into private stuff.  It's about, it's going to be about Sudan and stuff, which is a very interesting story.  And I talked to him about all that.  But I got his daddy to sit with me and George is in LA on remote.  And so rather than asking George about his private life, I asked the dad about George's  private life.  That way I'm not really contravening the agreement. 
[02:31:00]  I'm just circumnavigating it.  That's pretty smart.  Yeah.  That's pretty smart.  I said, would you, you've been married 50 years, Nick?  That's like when they took Pantangeli's brother into court and was a godfather.  What the hell are you doing?  The guy is here to support his brother.  But it's quite good.  I said to George's dad, Nick, I said, you know, you've been married a long time.  Would you like to see George get remarried?  Well, I would, yeah.  That's a great, that's a great way to do it.  But it's amazing how publicists will tell you, even if it's a show on CNN or any other  show, it's like that you can't ask certain questions. 
[02:31:30]  Well, let me tell you, the thing is this, I think publicists dig a hole for themselves  and for their clients when they put things off limits.  They're horrible.  It's like Oprah Winfrey walked through the door and she said, you can ask me absolutely  anything you want.  Let's get going.  Howard Stern, exactly the same thing.  And the favorite interviews I ever do with people, because I'm the same, you can ask me  whatever you like.  I don't have to answer.  I don't have to tell you anything.  But I think a journalist or an interviewer or anyone on radio, TV, newspapers, you should  have the basic human right to ask somebody anything you want to ask them.  And the moment you start putting limits on it, these people become less interesting. 
[02:32:00]  You know, when I read a very controlled interview or see one on television where there's a big  story about this person and they haven't talked about it.  You know that the interviewer has been gagged or agreed to be gagged.  Absolutely.  It's boring.  And the person looks more boring.  And also, I think when you give a chance to somebody to deny something or explain, like,  I would always want to be asked if something came up that was unpleasant so they could hear  my words on it instead of what was printed or what was said by other people.  That's a great opportunity for the artists.  But the publicists overprotect them. 
[02:32:30]  Massively overprotect them.  Getting back to Oprah, what did she say about the lesbian thing?  I forgot.  Well, she'd already done all that with Barbara Walters.  Right.  Did you go there a little bit?  Well, not really.  What someone has said in an interview three weeks before, A, I'm not a lesbian.  B, I never have been, and I never even thought about being, I mean, she can't be more unequivocal.  So, I mean, I would take her at face value.  I mean, it's interesting, her relationship with Gayle King is very interesting because  she's the best friend she has in the world.  But I genuinely think they are just incredibly close friends.  I don't think they are lesbians.  So, to me, it was a kind of, you know, it's one of those stories the media would love to 
[02:33:00]  believe.  And because Oprah had never really denied it, it sort of gets out there.  But I honestly don't think, I think she tells the truth.  I'm actually doing Leno Friday and Gayle King is the lead guest.  And I'm just going to put my face in her dressing room and say, come on, is it true or bullshit?  Come on.  That's the way to get to the bottom of it.  I'm not going to leave until they pull me away.  It's going to be an ugly moment.  Oh, and they will.  It appears a lot of people are concerned you're not going to be America's Got Talent anymore.  I'm staying on America's Got Talent.  That's my show.  Yeah.  That's how I know you.  I love that show. 
[02:33:30]  You're a big fan of Prince Poppycock.  I love Prince Poppycock.  Yeah, he blew it.  I bet he did.  You were too rough on Chips Cooney, though, I have to say.  Chips is a friend.  I thought you were a little too hard on Chips Cooney.  No, he's another one.  I didn't get Chips Cooney.  He just wasn't funny.  He is, though.  It's a weird, sarcastic attack on magic, which I really enjoyed.  He was trying to be too ironic.  I mean, that's funny.  Cristina Aguilera repeating the lines of the Star Spangled Banner.  What happened? 
[02:34:00]  What happened?  She messed up the lyrics.  Yeah.  But it wasn't like a lot of people were watching, so that's fine.  No, there was a lot of people watching.  She left out.  Or the Ramparts we watched.  She put in the previous line.  She did it twice, the same line.  Yeah, she did it twice, the same line.  So what would that be?  Everyone has to go back to the beginning to sing those songs.  But to make it fun of her, none of us can sing the song.  She went into What So Proudly We Hell, Twilight's Left.  But they won't hold paper.  They're afraid of looking bad, but it's like,  you look worse if you blow the song. 
[02:34:30]  Just hold a piece of paper or have a cheat sheet on your hand  or a fucking teleprompter.  There's not a lot of words.  Worse for practice two days before.  Dude, when you have 500 million people watching,  all your practice is out the window,  because I know she knows.  Yeah, I couldn't remember my own act if I had that many people.  How about a fucking teleprompter?  They can pop one right down there by the monitors,  and you can just look at it and then try it.  What was the reaction?  People were like,  Ow!  What, they're booing?  Boy, kill her!  Did people react like that? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, some people were booing.  Of course, you stole that mistake from Lady Gaga.  You know, they just yelled all that shit.  Hey, is there anybody you want to interview  that you have had problems getting access to?  I mean, obviously Obama or certain foreign heads of state.  Who do you really want?  Well, the great thing about CNN is you tend to get whoever you want,  pretty much.  Yeah.  Because it has, obviously, a domestic audience here,  but the global audience you can potentially get,  especially as, unlike with Larry's show,  they're airing mine in prime time in all the territories.  So in Europe and Asia and everything else,  you can get it at 8, 9 p.m. at night.  So the potential audience to a guest is huge. 
[02:35:30]  I mean, 300, 400 million people potentially.  And if you've got a brand that you want to get outside of America,  it's a fantastic platform.  Plus, you know, CNN, I'm not going to chew people up.  It's like, you know, it's an intelligent news network.  You want to have intelligent conversation with people.  And you want them to emerge out of it wanting to do your show again,  whilst you having a good time with them  and hopefully getting some good stuff out of them.  So, you know, we don't really have a problem with it.  Most people we've asked have come on.  What's the best interview you've ever seen?  Like the one where you went,  God damn it, I wish I had done that.  Frost Nixon.  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, okay.  I mean, David Frost is one of my great heroes,  because if you ever watch the tapes of that, the real ones,  never mind the movie,  they've got about 30 hours on tape.  But to finally get the confession  that the whole of America wanted to hear,  the whole world wanted to hear.  In the fourth and final meeting, right?  In the final thing.  You know, the drama building in your...  And again, David Frost was never too antagonistic.  He just kept probing, probing, probing,  incredibly well-researched,  building up to this moment  when finally, finally,  they got the confession out of Nixon.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  And it was an amazing moment. 
[02:36:30]  And that's what I call a brilliant interview.  Do you think that he would have gotten that, though,  had it not been for that call the night before  that really threw Nixon for a loop?  I think that was definitely part of it.  But, you know, he wouldn't have got the call  if he, David Frost,  hadn't put $600,000 of his own money up  in the early 70s.  So you're talking several million now,  because no network would put the money up to do it.  And he got, you know, he put the money up,  he got the result,  and that's an amazing thing to do.  So that's why he's one of my heroes.  I thought it was brilliant journalism.  I liked the movie, too.  Yeah.  Great movie.  To think that a movie about an interview would be good 
[02:37:00]  is just astounding.  I was like, yeah, let me check that out.  And it was.  It was compelling.  Very good.  It was really compelling, yeah.  It was amazing to me that Nixon was so smart  because he was, to avoid certain unpleasantries,  didn't just kind of filibuster,  he just kept talking.  Yeah, yeah.  So Frost couldn't jump in.  It was a brilliant, seasoned guy.  Well, it's a very political thing to do.  You know, when politicians don't want to ask us something,  they just keep talking about something else.  Or they answer a question they'd rather answer.  Are you used to interviewing politicians? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  I interviewed Tony Blair last week on Egypt,  and I interviewed him about ten times in Britain  when I was on the Daily Mirror.  So I used to interview people when I was editor of the paper.  But also I've done like six, seven years of interviews in Britain.  He seems like a nice guy.  Is he a nice guy?  You know what he is.  He's a, personally, he's an incredibly nice guy.  He's very well-mannered, he's very polite,  very charming, everything else.  I mean, I think he made a catastrophic mistake  as far as Britain's concerned with the Iraq War,  which has tarnished his reputation there.  Oddly, it kind of enhanced his reputation in America, 
[02:38:00]  where standing shoulder to shoulder with the Americans  after 9-11 gave him this amazing cachet here.  But, you know, in Britain,  for a Labour left-wing politician like Blair  becomes a party leader, then Prime Minister,  to take us into war,  on a pretext of weapons of mass destruction  that never turned up.  It killed his reputation in Britain.  Yeah.  But isn't that the case with an alliance  like the United States and England?  I think he almost had to. 
[02:38:30]  It's almost like an obligation between both countries  that we really have to kind of back each other up.  It's this, ever since, you know,  even before World War II.  I think every Britain's instinct, honestly,  would be to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Americans,  because we view you as genuinely great allies of ours  from the Second World War in particular onwards.  We've always been together on these things.  I think the problem with Iraq was nobody was quite sure  why we were fighting that war. 
[02:39:00]  No one was sure.  And, you know, it seemed to...  My brother had to do two tours of Iraq,  so I had a vested interest in this.  And I didn't get it.  You know, I didn't think he ever had weapons of mass destruction.  I thought the whole thing was a pack of lies.  If you want a regime change, say so.  Just come out and say we want to get rid of Saddam.  Then people can make their judgment about you  based on whether that's a good idea or not.  But, you know, it's a dangerous thing.  As we've seen with the Middle East right now,  regime change is at its best  when it's driven from the bottom by the people up.  Yeah.  That's how regimes ought to change.  You can't force a people. 
[02:39:30]  When you start going in forcing your freedom and democracy  on countries that have a totally different system,  imagine how we feel.  Imagine how America would feel.  If some other country woke up one day and said,  we don't like the way you're being run.  We're going to steam in with our military  and we're going to enforce our beliefs on you.  Trust me, how long is that going to last, right?  So you've got to be very careful.  When you're as powerful as America  and Britain allied with America,  you've got to be very careful how you utilize that power.  Question two, what do you think of David Cameron?  I think he's my new favorite person in his remarks about... 
[02:40:00]  Oh, yeah, that was great.  Stop coddling Islamic extremists  and stop handling them softly.  It's like nobody talks that way, honestly.  Yeah, and I don't understand why,  because nobody...  I don't like extremists of any kind.  I just think the word extremism  is the most dangerous word in our language right now,  because it's extremists that cause the problems.  It's not Muslims that cause problems.  It's Islamic fundamentalists  who want to kill people that cause problems.  And this is where Cameron,  our British Prime Minister, was right to say that.  And it's where you have to just be focused 
[02:40:30]  on who the enemy really is.  You know, it's incredibly dangerous  when I see that idiot pastor  burning the Koran recently,  you know, trying to make some...  That was unnecessary.  ...fatuous point.  All that's doing is whipping people up  into hating Muslims.  That's never going to help anything.  But do you think, though,  that the problem I have with the media in general,  and I'm generalizing,  is the way they always...  And politicians do it, too.  Let's not jump to conclusions  like Major Hassan is yelling  Allahu Akbar and murdering people,  and it's an act of Islamic extremism  by a nut, you know.  And it's amazing how there is this fear of saying it, 
[02:41:00]  and the media doesn't want to say it,  and politicians don't want to say it,  and it's amazing the way people  just will not address what the real problem is.  If there's a stigma put on you  the second you even address extremist Islam,  then you're tiptoeing around it so much  because you're so scared of getting called out  and being an Islamophobe.  It is, but the way to do this  is that when you talk about these things,  you have to talk about extremists generally.  There are extreme Christians in this country 
[02:41:30]  who do wacky stuff,  who want to harm people.  But is it really as much?  It sounds like an awesome time to plug Red State.  Ah, yes!  But I'm a Catholic.  I was brought up a Catholic,  and there are extreme Catholics  that cause me extreme discomfort.  And I think when you talk about extremism,  talk about it and mention a few religions.  Don't make it look like the only people  you think are bad people in the world  are Islamic fundamentalists.  But is the security at the airports  and at malls and our train stations, 
[02:42:00]  are we really looking for Christian extremists  and Catholic extremists,  or are we looking for Islamic extremists, honestly?  Well, I think the reality is,  in terms of attacks on America,  they've primarily come from  Islamic fundamentalists on 9-11.  That's what you're primarily dealing with.  But don't tell me the only atrocities  that happen in America  are from fundamentalists.  No, no, you can look at Oklahoma City.  Right, we have a variant, Terry Nichols, sure.  Look at Arizona recently.  Sure.  Another nut, absolutely.  Another nut. 
[02:42:30]  You're always going to get nuts  that are just crazy  without really a cause or anything.  There is a cause  that is buried in the Koran,  in the religion itself,  that translated or interpreted by a lot,  it's not a lot,  relatively speaking,  to all of Islam,  but I think a disproportionate number  of people interpret it  very violently.  They go into conflict  very violently. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, but this is where my problem  comes with this,  because you can interpret  a lot of the Bible  as ordering you to go and kill people  if you want to.  And they do.  Right, right.  If you want to.  And there are Christians out there,  as much as there are  Islamic fundamentalists,  who will interpret  passage of the Bible,  eye for an eye,  tooth for a tooth,  and go and kill people.  But then again,  are we looking for people  with vest bombs  that are Catholic?  Well, I don't know about you,  but on every plane I get,  they search a lot of people.  Yeah.  I know,  and that seems to be  a waste of time.  Well, it may be,  but you have to,  if I was controlling  the security of America  right now,  I'd be bloody careful 
[02:43:30]  that I make sure  everyone is checked.  Because the next attack  may well, by the way,  come not in the shape  of an Islamic fundamentalist,  but it might be them  recruiting somebody  who is a normal...  The family going to Disney,  really?  Well, you know something?  Like, that to me  is a waste of time.  Hey, they could be Chechnians,  but they'd be Muslims.  Yeah, that's true.  Stranger things have happened,  and they're not the only ones  that want to kill Americans  or kill Britain.  But stranger things  have happened, yes.  But I'm not talking  about a blanket overall guarantee  nothing's ever going  to happen again.  But you've got to  play your averages  and put your resources... 
[02:44:00]  You're in charge  of Homeland Security  in this country.  Would you have  the kind of restrictive  security we have  at airports now or not?  Or would you run the risk?  And by the way,  I phrase that very deliberately.  Yeah.  Would you run the risk  that on your watch  tomorrow morning,  because you didn't,  because you relaxed  the security regulations,  another 9-11 happened  in, say, Chicago?  I wouldn't have relaxed...  Would you be the guy  that's prepared to relax them?  I wouldn't relax regulations.  I would put resources  where they belong  and make it better  by using profiling.  Profiling's used 
[02:44:30]  all the time.  I read an article about it.  And what happens  if the only guy  that actually ends up  blowing up another plane  turns out to be  a guy like the guy  in Arizona  who wants to make a point?  Profiling doesn't guarantee  anything,  but it does work.  Profiling,  which is very precise  and very targeted,  actually missed that guy  because, hey,  he's white and American.  But it would have missed him  anyway, it appears,  because people are  being polite  and not stopping  certain people anyway.  It's this phony politeness  and we're denying  that something exists. 
[02:45:00]  And even though,  I know you're being  very honest,  but there's that asterisk  people always put  when they talk  about Islamic extremism.  What about Christians?  What about this?  But if you're talking  about the Klan,  nobody says,  what about other groups?  We know you're talking  about a bunch of white pigs  who are racist.  Or if we talk  about the mob,  nobody talks about  this one or that one.  You're talking  about the Russian mob,  you're talking  about the Russians.  We all know  who we're addressing,  but there is this  phony politeness  and, hey, guys,  I don't see it  when we all see it.  And that's the dishonesty.  Well, Britain went 
[02:45:30]  through a long period  when I was growing up.  The IRA in Britain,  financed a lot of the time  by Americans,  by the way,  they were blowing up  a lot of people in London,  my home city,  and everyone grew  to hate everybody Irish.  If you had an Irish accent  in London for 20 years,  you got beaten up.  And it was horrible.  In the end,  we went and talked  to the enemy.  This is not an acceptable  view in America,  but British politicians  went and talked  to Sinn Féin,  the political wing  of the IRA. 
[02:46:00]  They sat down  with Gerry Adams  and Martin McGuinness,  who regularly came  to fundraise in New York,  by the way,  and they sat with them,  they talked them through,  they ended up releasing  a lot of very bad guys,  ended up promoting  these people  to be politicians  in their own country.  They actually preached  freedom and democracy  through killers,  and in the end,  guess what?  We reached a place  where the IRA  stood down their arms,  and we've had  no outrages  from the IRA  in London,  I think,  in the last 15 years.  This may be  an unthinkable way  for Americans to think,  but the way to deal 
[02:46:30]  with the enemy sometimes  is to go and sit down  with them.  Because we did that  in England,  and as a result,  Irish people can walk,  I'm Irish,  you can walk around  London now  and not be hated  just because you have  an Irish accent.  Fair enough,  and that's a good point,  although I will say  the difference is,  I don't think the IRA  attacked commercial airliners.  I think the IRA kept it...  The IRA blew up  hundreds of people  on the streets of London.  It's all a question  of degree.  You can multiply  the numbers,  the principles are the same.  Wanton, extreme killers.  Okay, fair enough.  But they're all also... 
[02:47:00]  I'm sorry, buddy,  did they...  No, the problem.  But when they were  looking for IRA members,  did they stop Americans?  Did they stop people  who they knew  were Jews from Israel?  Of course they didn't.  They looked for who  they knew they were  looking for.  And that's how you also  go after something,  is if you're going  to target people...  Honestly,  I think specific profiling,  especially in terms of airliners,  is an incredibly dangerous  thing to be doing.  I really do.  I think the moment  you only start frisking  people you think  might be Muslim  fundamentalists.  No, I don't mean only.  You've got a big problem.  I don't mean only,  but the primary...  Where do you draw  the line, though?  How far do you go with it?  Common sense.  And I think that, again, 
[02:47:30]  you're never going  to get it 100%,  because sure,  there are Chechnians  there, there are white people...  It's easy for us  to say around here,  if you're the director  of Homeland Security,  and you absolutely  want to 100%  prevent another  a trust in the airways,  where do you draw  the line with this profiling?  Who are you not  going to check?  You have to check.  It doesn't mean...  By doing profiling,  I'm not saying  remove other checks.  I am just saying,  when you get an instinct  or a feeling about a guy  and you see...  Stop pretending  that you don't  have that feeling.  When 9-11 happened, 
[02:48:00]  we all knew  who it was.  When those London  bombings happened,  everybody knew  what group,  what religion,  the profile.  Everybody knew  in 93,  when the Trade Center  was attacked,  who had done it.  And again,  there was a false one  in Oklahoma.  We thought it was  Middle Eastern men,  and we were wrong.  It was McVeigh and Nichols.  So I'm not saying  it's 100%.  But let's just stop this.  We're bullshitting.  We're all sitting in a room  pretending.  Well, coming back  to your first point.  Your first point  was a good one,  which is that  there should be  no problem  in political leaders  like David Cameron  or Barack Obama 
[02:48:30]  talking specifically  about Islamic  fundamentalist extremists  where there is  absolutely no doubt  from their rhetoric  that they want  to kill people  and kill lots of people.  Where you're talking  about that body  of people,  there should be  absolutely no question.  You go after them  as hard as you can.  But you've got to be  very careful  that in doing that  you don't alienate  a whole population  of Muslims.  I understand that.  But also,  I would like to see  a lot more outrage  from the non-extreme Muslims, 
[02:49:00]  people that are just  practicing the religion.  They don't seem  to really want to  call out the extremists  and say,  wow,  that is bad  what they're doing.  And also,  the point about the IRA,  there was something  to sit down  and hammer out  with them  what they wanted.  They wanted their freedom.  Now,  when you have to sit  with an enemy  that just wants you  dead because of  your lifestyle,  that's a little hard  to find common ground.  Wait a minute.  The IRA wanted  British politicians dead.  Oh,  they did,  but that was to get 
[02:49:30]  Margaret Thatcher  and her whole government.  They killed some people  that day.  Right,  but that was to get  what they wanted.  They had an end  to their means.  They wanted...  A political.  They actually had  a political agenda.  What he's saying is  that Muslim extremists  don't have a political agenda.  They don't have an agenda.  They have an agenda.  It's like Independence Day.  They want the end  of what they see  as the imperialistic West,  which they believe  propagates, you know,  these sort of  Western values  that they despise.  It's a similar,  it's a similar,  in their heads,  they believe absolutely  the way they treat women  and the way,  like,  we treat women  so they look at us 
[02:50:00]  as infidels  and we have to pay  with our lives for it.  How do you bargain  with that kind of fanaticism?  The answer is  you have to...  I saw a recent interview  with Rudy Giuliani  and he'd been meeting  with a fairly extreme group  and got a lot of flack for it  and I looked at it  as a Brit  who'd been through  the whole IRA thing  and thought,  however unpalatable this is,  actually at some point  somebody has to be brave  enough to do this.  You have to get  inside the heads  of these people  and try and work out  some kind of future 
[02:50:30]  which doesn't involve  every Islamic fundamentalist  wanting to kill Americans  because if you don't  they're going to carry  on doing it  and you're going to  carry on killing them  but in the end  there has to be  an end to this.  You've got to try  and work together.  The world's a small place now.  You look at emergence  of China and India  and Brazil  and all these countries,  America won't even be  the biggest economy  in 20 years' time.  So the days of being  the only big beasts  in the jungle are over.  And, you know,  essentially when I hear  Americans talking badly  about the Chinese  for example,  the Chinese don't  want to kill you.  The Chinese want  to do business with you.  They want to take  your business 
[02:51:00]  but they don't want  to kill you.  The Chinese ought to be  really friends of America  and, you know,  Americans should work with them  apart from anything else  they own most of you.  So, yeah,  it's like,  I really believe that.  When I went to China  recently,  I did a documentary on them.  I got no sense  of them wanting  to be imperialistic  militarily  or to invade countries  or anything like that.  They are business people.  Now, I think they've  embraced their  capitalistic side  and realized,  wow, we can be a part  of the world economy.  Here's the key thing.  They're not very religious,  the Chinese.  They don't have much  religious factor 
[02:51:30]  to their thinking.  And as a result,  they don't actually  want to kill people.  They want to kill you  in business.  They want to be number one.  They want to be top dogs.  Now, I went to big towns  in China  where they have  90% of the world's  duvets manufactured  or 85% of the world's  buttons.  That's what's going on  in China.  They're not worried  so much about  the military end of things.  But when I've been  in America,  probably out of fear,  and to a certain degree  it happens in Britain too,  there's this real kind of,  the Chinese are coming,  they want to take us over.  They don't. 
[02:52:00]  They want to take over  your business.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where America  has to work out very quickly  how to take on  the new challenge  from these countries.  Because if you don't,  you're going to get  economically flatlined by them.  Well, they also steal stuff too.  It's like,  the one thing they can't make  with Apple is the way  they make the actual  one piece of the computer.  But the Chinese are like,  well, fuck you.  You don't want to do business?  We'll take it.  What are you going to do?  Go to China and sue  the communist government?  They don't recognize  international copyright.  They don't care.  I found a chateau  that was being designed  on the outskirts of Shanghai  that was exactly the same 
[02:52:30]  as a chateau in Bordeaux  in France,  which is one of my favorite  wine is made.  They'd flown in the top  winemakers from Bordeaux,  paying them vast sums of money.  They had created  exactly the same  acreage of land.  It looked exactly like  this chateau in Bordeaux.  They had the same  climate in Shanghai  pretty much as they get  in northern France.  And they reckon  within 10 years  they'll be producing  wine of a standard  of the great  Chateau Lafitte houses  or Chateau La Tour.  And it'll be made  by French experts  in the middle of China.  Maybe they can import  people who drive well. 
[02:53:00]  And I say,  rather than saying,  isn't that terrible?  I say,  good on them.  Good on them.  That's the kind of  energy drive,  dynamism,  and smart thinking  that made America  what it was.  So for Americans  to have to sit back  and go,  this is terrible.  No,  this is admirable.  And actually,  more Americans  should stand up  and say,  I want to be more  like,  here's the thing,  I've got three sons.  I was out with my  three sons the other day  playing football,  soccer,  the real football.  And I managed  miraculously to score  a good goal.  A bit of a David Beckham 
[02:53:30]  Well,  how old are they?  Are they like all...  17,  13,  and 10.  I thought they were  four and six.  I did a wolf's  past three two.  Get out of the way,  son.  But I scored  this great goal.  And two of the three boys  instantly went,  oh,  dad,  that was so Chinese.  And I stopped  and I went,  what did you say?  I thought they were  being racist.  Because they all  go to schools  with lots of Chinese kids.  I said,  what did you mean by that?  And they both started  laughing and went,  oh,  dad,  we're not being racist.  We meant that was  really good.  It was Chinese. 
[02:54:00]  Oh,  wow.  Now,  if that isn't a moment  to stop and think  if you're a Briton  or an American,  you know,  back in the early part  of the last century,  that comment would have  been,  you're so British.  Right?  Yeah.  You know,  from the middle  of the century onwards,  that's so American.  Or Mighty Whitey-er.  That was one  for a long time.  But now it's,  you're so Chinese.  Well,  I'll tell you one thing  about China,  though.  They sure love  using our movies  for their fighter plane  exhibits and examples.  They actually took  a clip from Top Gun 
[02:54:30]  and said that  this was their new fighter  that they put out.  This is some test footage  from our new fighter.  And it was frame by frame  from the movie.  Oh,  God.  It was one of the models  being shot.  She made clean.  Yeah.  They did a split screen.  She also in accused.  They did a split screen  and it matched up perfectly.  They got caught.  They got caught.  They're very concerning  in China.  I took around pictures  of Barack Obama,  the British Prime Minister, 
[02:55:00]  the Queen,  David Beckham,  and Simon Cowell.  And they'd heard  of all of them  apart from Simon Cowell.  I'm sorry,  they made you feel good.  No one on the streets  of Shanghai  had ever heard of him.  I loved that moment.  I made sure  he knew immediately.  We got Brooklyn Decker  down the hall,  so I don't know  if she could join  in the conversation.  I'm going to clear her mic.  I'm going to get out of here  so she can have a song.  Pretty girl coming in.  Make way for the lady,  the pretty lady.  Pretty lady.  Do you want to hang?  Or you got to go?  Actually,  I've got to go quite so  I can give you a little bit. 
[02:55:30]  Can I ask you another question  before we go?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a couple more things.  I'm curious as to how you feel  because the media in general,  the media, again,  and Fox is very conservative  and other ones are very biased  liberally.  Where do you think  the media is fairly balanced?  Like, where are they balanced  where there's kind of like  both ideologies?  Well, this will sound  completely self-serving,  but it's one of the reasons  I joined CNN.  CNN's the crucially...  Because you're on lefty?  I think if you watch CNN,  you don't get bombarded  with partisan... 
[02:56:00]  And by the way,  I love watching,  when I'm in the right mood,  partisan television, right?  I love watching Glenn Beck  and Bill O'Reilly.  I like watching Keith Oberman  and Rachel Manobit.  Depending on the mood I'm in,  like most journalists,  I'd switch around anyway.  I think a lot of issues now  sort of circumnavigate  left and right anyway.  So I like watching them.  But do I want to actually  do that myself?  No, I think there's a really  important position for CNN  right now,  which is globally,  the reason they are  the most trusted name in news  as their advertising goes  is because they really are. 
[02:56:30]  They're independent.  And people accuse them  of being liberal.  I don't see that  in the programming that I watch.  And I've been here  a few months now watching it.  They try and toe the straight line  whilst expressing opinion  that doesn't necessarily mean  they have to be pigeonholed  right or left.  It's important  so that Americans have a choice.  If you're in the mood  for a bit of right-wing whacking,  turn on Bill O'Reilly  and hear him whack away  and it's hugely popular.  I know whack you mean  something else here,  doesn't it?  Yes.  I don't mean it quite in the way.  Probably a lot more fun  than the way you're meaning it.  Toss off. 
[02:57:00]  I believe in choice.  I really do.  I think everybody knows  what they're getting  when they watch Fox News  and you know what you're getting  when you're watching MSNBC.  And you should know  what you're getting  when you're watching CNN.  If you want to have  unpartisan,  unbiased reporting,  put on CNN for a bit.  If you're in the mood  for a bit of a rough and tumble,  put on the others.  But my job,  as I see it,  is to make the independent voice  of CNN more opinionated.  I mean,  the stuff we've been  talking about today,  I don't think I could be  honestly positioned  as left or right  based on misdiscution.  Right, right.  There will be people 
[02:57:30]  like Bill O'Reilly  listening to it  who might want to pick up  some of the things I say  and say,  he's a lefty  and there'll be people  on the left going,  actually,  he's a righty.  Or taken out of context stuff  is the best  for making it look  quick soundbite.  And I don't care about that.  But in the end,  I've expressed what I believe  to be opinions  which are perfectly sound opinions  but open to debate.  Everyone's entitled  to an opinion.  Where it strays too much  I always know when a news story breaks  exactly how MSNBC  and Fox will report it.  When you're that predictable,  there's something wrong.  News is not that predictable 
[02:58:00]  and it shouldn't be.  What's happening in Egypt  is a classic example.  Most Americans,  I think,  are quite confused.  Is Mubarak  a good or bad guy?  Because he's been  a great ally to America  and make no bones about it.  He has been.  His people love him.  But he's a dictator  to his people.  Right.  Exactly in the way,  not quite as bad  but in a similar vein  in recent years  to Saddam Hussein.  He's made himself  stinking rich.  He's terrorised his people  through his military police.  You know,  it's all intents and purposes.  He's a pretty bad guy.  But at the same time,  he's protected Israel  from a lot of outrage 
[02:58:30]  that would have come their way  without Egypt's support.  He's been a great ally  to America  both in terms of Israel  and in terms of oil  and other stuff.  He's been an important player  on the side of America.  But if you're watching  Bill O'Reilly  or you're watching Rachel Maddow,  you would be drawn  to a certain position  about him  which is probably  neither is right.  The middle position  is pretty well right.  The CNN position will be  look at this in its totality.  This guy is good and bad  and he's not very bad  and he's not very good. 
[02:59:00]  He's kind of in the middle  like most of the  Middle Eastern leaders are.  And he's been useful  to America  and a friend to America  whilst being bad  to his people.  And that is why  people don't like us too  a lot of times  because a lot of them  don't like us  because we do pick and choose  who we're self-righteously angry at.  If you're a prick  but you are a prick  it's like Ahmadinejad  we hate  but Saddam we love.  It is kind of selective.  I don't like when people  get on the United States' ass  I just wanted to say  Ahmadinejad  and prove I knew his name.  I just wanted to sound smart.  I don't pronounce that correctly. 
[02:59:30]  I shoehorned that in.  I wasn't expecting that  on this show.  I'm a total phony.  I'm a phony.  I don't like when  they take what alliances  we had 20, 30 years ago  and criticize us now for it  because there was a time  for a certain alliance  if it turned bad  over the years  and this leader  that we sold weapons to  for years  all of a sudden  we find out  oh he's a nasty dictator  to his people  he's terrible  and they go  well you supplied him  it's like it made sense  during the Cold War  to get into bed  with some people 
[03:00:00]  that weren't all that good  I can name them for you  Saddam Hussein  Osama bin Laden  Mubarak  I mean all these people  in some stages  have been friends  of the West  because they were  our enemy's enemy  correct  so to catch shit  for that  seems really odd  that people won't  look at the big picture  and say  we had to do that  we have to bring  Booker  yeah we got it  let's bring her in  absolutely  let's bring her in  yeah of course  I'm a blow  Kevin  tell me about this mark  yes  Red State  March 5th 
[03:00:30]  Radio City Music Hall  tickets and info  ticket info dates  coopersdell.com  and soon to be on  Piers Morgan's show  I'm seeing you next week  I'm intimidated now  because you're just  the smartest man  I've listened to speak  this week  and I know it's only  Monday  but still  I was sitting there  like my jaw was slack  I was like  I'm not going to be able  to use any die hard jokes  you're the smartest guy  in the Opie and Anthony room  that's not a great compliment  good seeing you guys  Kevin thanks man  take care  oh could I be in  one of your movies  of course  wow was that 
[03:01:00]  the standard answer  hi Brooklyn  Brooklyn Decker  for the new movie  just go with it  Piers Morgan  from CNN of course  hi  hi  and we don't know  how to talk to  really good looking girls  thank god you're here  thank god you're here  you're going to save  this interview  we've just got rid of  a fairly aesthetically  challenged old man  we just upgraded  this is perfect  oh damn  I've just cleaned my schedule  no problem  Piers is sticking around now 
[03:01:30]  it is very  it is intimidating  because especially in here  we usually just have  a bunch of guys talking  so when a pretty girl  comes in  we are the worst  oh please  I'm not the first  you've seen  won't be the last  first I've seen today  trust me  thank god she doesn't  have a sexy voice  though  this is sick  this is not sexy  do you know how  sexy sick girl voice is  the higher the fever  the sexier the girl  yeah I love a good flu  nothing hotter than a flu  sporting about 103.5 
[03:02:00]  it's nice  well good  you are very  very attractive  we were looking at  some of your pictures  your swimsuit issue  pictures of course  wow  really  where are they  right in front of you  you know how to work  your computer  Piers  how long are you modeling  I have been modeling  for five years  well  longer  yeah I started  when I was 16  and I moved to New York  really sorry for the voice  I've paid lots of money 
[03:02:30]  for that voice  it's kind of like  Brenda Vaccaro  but hot  I'll try to  so yeah  I moved to New York  when I was 18  and that was five years ago  so I've been doing it  full time since 2000  and where did you get  an agency in like an hour  no  no  I got scouted at a mall  you know  it's that typical story  you hear  by a girl  I usually try to scout  at a mall  until the police  I know  it's creepy  I gotta have a card made up  even if it's not real  just to meet women  at the mall  how great is that  I'm telling you 
[03:03:00]  it would work  we all fall for it  so I got started locally  and then got scouted  in North Carolina  which is where I grew up  and moved to New York  in 05  and this is your first film  country girl in New York  yes  you're really good  in the film  I saw it  you did see it  thank you  you're really good  in it  you're such a bad liar  no I'm serious  thank you  he said that to us  privately  ok well  it was my first movie  so keep that in mind  which is pretty amazing  thank you  he goes to all the rom-coms  no I don't  I don't want that out there  I know  it appears I'm not a rom-com guy 
[03:03:30]  I saw it for the show  it's the breaking news  it's the worst possible news  for Christina Aguilera  it was the highest ever  Superbowl rating  last night  which means the largest number  of Americans in history  watched a repeated line  in the national anthem  was it three  I was there  I just got in this morning  I was there yesterday  at the game  and was it three words  she sang the wrong song  it was America the Beautiful  she repeated one whole line  yeah  because we were all singing along  and all of us  we sort of looked  at the people I was with  we all sort of looked  at each other  and we were like  did I miss out the words  or did we  and I know on TV 
[03:04:00]  everyone clearly caught that  yeah they were like  ooh  the players were looking  at each other  and they were like  what the hell  it's humiliating  they've heard the song  enough times  but you feel for her  that's nerve wracking  I mean come on  it's gotta be  all those people  it's quite funny though  isn't it  yeah we do feel for her  but one of us is happy  see if I was a manager  or someone like that  I'd say make sure  you make a mistake  yeah  just do something  because Janet Jackson  it may have been deliberate  it might be  we can get so much publicity  out of being the one  that makes a mistake  Roseanne when she went out there  and sang horribly  grabbing her crotch though  that made a lot of news 
[03:04:30]  right there  the crotch grab  we're still talking about that  so you were at the Super Bowl  I was  how'd you score that one  what do you think  exactly  no we were there for the movie  but it was my fifth Super Bowl  I've been to a lot  I'm a big football fan  so  who's your team  the Panthers  oh wow  I know  I know  sympathy  sympathy points there  yeah 2-14 this year  real proud  but we have a new coach  Ron Rivera  I'm quite excited about that  but anyway 
[03:05:00]  so yeah  Carolina Panther fan  but I was rooting for the Packers  so I was happy  yeah I was too  just the dirty Steelers  I don't want to see them  win another one  I just don't like them  Pittsburgh is spoiled  you really don't like them  the Steelers no  it was a great game  that was one of the best ever  turned out to be  as close as they said to me  were you nervous acting at all  because I get very nervous  when I act  like I never know what to do  with my hands  I tell this to everybody  explain please  like in talking conversationally  I know how to listen  I know how to talk  I'm gesticulating a little bit  just because I know 
[03:05:30]  she probably thinks  it's kind of hard of me  to do so  but I don't know how to do it  when I'm in a scene  it's like my hands  just feel like these two rocks  and I know if I pick them up  it's just going to look stiff  and Ralph Kramdenish  are you talking about  love scenes here  or what are you talking about  no one's ever asked me  to do a love scene  I would love to  you know  Shawshank Redemption  kind of one I did once  I interviewed Colin Firth  this week  he goes up later in the week  for the King's Speech  obviously he's brilliant  and he's going to win  all the Oscars hopefully  but I was asking him  about when you do a love scene  and he's got this beautiful  Italian wife  I said what does she think  when she sees you  romping around with  Scarlett Johansson or something 
[03:06:00]  and he's really funny about it  he's like nobody really likes it  on either side  it's like it's uncomfortable  and then I said  how would you feel for example  if your wife then did a love scene  with Brad Pitt  she was an actress  he said I'd hate it  you know it's a really  it's an unusual thing  to have to do isn't it  have you done any of these  I have I have  who did you have to do it with  this one was with Adam Sandler  is that good or bad  I can't work it out  I can't work it out  I mean  he's great  but it is an awkward thing  my husband like yelled out  some profanity  when we saw the private screening 
[03:06:30]  he was like you  I don't know what I can say  on the radio  he was like you skank  but he was obviously  in good  well we like to say  goodbye to Brooklyn Decker  for showing up today  not only husband  Andy Roddick  I know  yeah  yeah but we know  we were watching  and he yelled that out  jokingly of course  but yeah it's never  it's never a fun thing  you kind of  you know you're going to  shoot that day  and you sort of tell  how did Adam Sandler's  wife feel about it  apparently  well he  I don't know 
[03:07:00]  I can't speak for her  but apparently in an interview  she  because he had a kiss  both Jennifer Anderson  and I in this movie  and apparently she's like  honey make sure  you do a good job  put on chapstick  you want to do good  for Jen  you want to do a good job  so she was encouraging him  she's like the cool wife  my wife wouldn't be  that encouraging  if she saw me  jumping into bed with you  I can tell you  on a very uncomfortable  day in the office  if my spouse  made Adam Sandler money  I wouldn't care  if she did Bukkake films  you'll tolerate a lot  for 20 mil of film  does your husband 
[03:07:30]  do like the uncomfortable  smile  kind of like  oh look look  she's kissing another man  no he yells out  slut  that's what he does  there's no  he's not concealing  any feelings  what was the first scene  you shot  like the first  moment on film  what was the first scene  you shot  and were you nervous  and did you blow it at all  or did you actually  get through it fun  I did okay the first day  it was the first scene  I shot  they actually  we shot in chronological order  which is sort of  unusual for movies  you usually shoot  everything out of order  so the first scene 
[03:08:00]  was actually my character  meeting Adam Sandler's character  for the first time  so we got to  we were still new  kind of in our friendship  so we got to  have that scene  and it felt  kind of nice actually  like authentic  and good  but then three days later  was the love scene  which was terrifying  and do you actually have to be  completely naked  for these scenes  no  not this one  how do you protect yourself  from  well this one  you know what it was  it was sort of like  a make out scene  and then you wake up  on the beach  so it's kind of  it's insinuated  which is good  it wasn't full on  anything  beach sex though 
[03:08:30]  yeah  it's  I mean I  who really thinks  that's good  who really enjoys that  oh I do  do you like it  where does the sand go  what do you order  grunion  I wouldn't be thinking  where does the sand go  trust me  the whole week  you're like  I guess it's a good  exfoliation  exactly how I'd be  viewing this  you don't have to be  exfoliated  I hope you're as honest  months from now  on CNN peers  I will be 
[03:09:00]  you better be  because they have a way  of getting to you  after a while  don't you  CNN is nothing like  people told me  it was going to be  I love your honesty  they give us great freedom  and they want me  to be opinionated  they realize that  perhaps in this new  cable jungle  CNN's been slightly  outshouted  and not opinionated  there's a reason  you can't be opinionated  but not have to fall  into the trap  of being right or left  do you think that  network is kind of  was a brilliant  foreshadowing by Chayefsky  it's amazing how  the news  it's not that extreme  but like wow  it really  he was a smart guy  completely  and it's you know 
[03:09:30]  it's Americans get  their news in all sorts  of different ways now  it's completely changed  everyone gets news  off their cell phones  or their computers  or whatever  their iPads  how you disseminate  news and opinion  to people is going  to be very very different  CNN.com is one of the  most downloaded  websites in the world  yeah  and they put loads  of stuff on there  which never gets on air  which is still viewed  by millions of people  so how you get  information to people  is now going to be done  in very very different ways  but CNN has a very  important role to play  right now in this country 
[03:10:00]  and I really believe  it's an exciting time  to be there  because when you watch  their coverage last week  from Egypt  if you wanted to find out  what's really going on there  without a bias  from your presenter  who just has an agenda  anyway about this kind of thing  you had to watch CNN  we get it  you love CNN  he loves CNN  I love my company  my network  are you a techie girl  do you have your gadgets  and your phones  yeah I mean I have an iPhone  and a computer  but I'm not like an iPad user 
[03:10:30]  not like a nerdy techie  or nothing  no I'm pretty  do you want to say that  I guess a standard  yes I do actually  yeah I'm actually  it's funny because you guys  were talking about Egypt  when I walked in  and I'm not going to sit here  and act like I'm this  crazy intelligent person  I'm like you are  but it's interesting  you said that again  no but it's interesting  because I actually like  I like reading  like during the election  I read both McCain  and Obama's books  and I like reading  kind of both sides  so I sort of like  watching Fox, NBC, and CNN  and it's interesting  to see how  for example  now we're talking politics  it's interesting to see 
[03:11:00]  how with Egypt  you have  I was watching one channel  and it was saying  because I know  the Muslim Brotherhood  they met yesterday  and I was at the Super Bowl  so unfortunately  I missed it  you missed the meeting  you mean  I missed the meeting  I was invited  if anyone could bring peace  I missed the meeting  in Egypt  but it's interesting  because from one end  you know  I think a lot of Americans  sort of fear  the overthrow  or technically  of the government  and then you know  then you think about it  and these people  are being oppressed  and so change needs to happen 
[03:11:30]  it's just  my point is that  did you ever imagine  you'd be discussing this  this morning  no but I'm kind of glad  that we are  I'm so glad that we are  probably sick of you  she's probably sick of  talking about the movie  at this point  it's kind of nice  to talk about it  talk about something different  I think we're afraid  of the vacuum  that would be created  if he just left  if Mubarak just left  and we are afraid  of the Muslim Brotherhood  because  but  you're afraid of them  because of their name  when actually  anyone in Egypt 
[03:12:00]  will tell you  the Muslim Brotherhood  are actually  pretty non-extreme  at the moment  they may get  infiltrated by extremists  but as we stand  they've been the major  opposition party there  for a long time  they are not that extreme  certainly not by comparison  to other countries  I think  their take on Israel  might be a little extreme  you know  if you want to know  where the real problem  for America would lie  it would be  if the same kind of  uprising happens  in someone like Yemen  where it's a much  poorer country  much more extreme country  you could end up  very quickly  with a kind of 
[03:12:30]  Afghanistan part two  there  and any expert  will tell you that  it's not  Egypt has never been  the main concern  it has been  for security of Israel  and because it's  been very good  in terms of oil  but you want  you want to have  one hell of a  bad situation  then wait until  protests like this  start happening  in Yemen  but aren't they all  too high in Yemen  what do they chew  they chew like  cat or something  there's that weird  drug that everybody  in Yemen chews  yeah  yes there's this weird  they chew cat  I don't know  is cat a drug  is that the drug  am I getting  the drug name  properly  there's some kind 
[03:13:00]  of a weird  literally cat  yeah there's some  kind of a weird  thing that they chew  which kind of  acts like an opiate  of some sort  and they're all high  so you're saying  all Yemenis  are zombies  we can't say all  okay 98%  no but that's a big  it's a big thing  my manager  my manager  Jonathan told me  he knows everything  all you have to  understand about  the Middle East  look at Egypt's  profile now  I think it's 66%  of their population  are now under 30  right but 95%  of the unemployment  is those 66%  of under 30s  right so you have 
[03:13:30]  a much better  educated populace  young educated  on the internet  seeing there's  another life  to be led out  in other countries  that's what does it  and they are  not getting jobs  and when that  you have that  kind of set up  where intelligent  people well educated  go through school  don't get a job  at the end  it's a recipe  for complete disaster  I always  I've always said  like information  is what just  folds up dictatorships  yeah it is  you watch the  Soviet Union  it happened  with the Soviet Union  a lot of the 
[03:14:00]  eastern bloc countries  they started seeing  what was happening  in the world  and saying  well it isn't  quite what you  were telling us  do you see  something happening  like that with China  because I know  their people are  really left in the dark  a large percentage  in China  they employ  I think it's  30,000 people  employed by the  government  when I was there  to suppress the  youth from using  Twitter  Facebook  and so on  but the youth  all just laugh  I took a load  of them out  one night  they're all  getting their  phones out  they don't use  Chinese proxies  for the internet  they use  American proxies  French proxies  whatever they  can get their 
[03:14:30]  hands on  and they just  circumnavigate  all these  government officials  they're smarter  than the government  and what you're  seeing in Egypt  they're smarter  they're quicker  that's why we're  getting people  still flashing out  tweets and stuff  when there's supposed  to be no internet  coverage  they are  the young  educated people  my kids  my kids can run  rings around me  on internet stuff  my 10 year old  hooks up  the other day  I watched him  he's 10 years old  and I found him  down in his little  den in my house  and he's got his  earphones on like this  and he's tap tap  tapping him  and I said  what are you doing  and he went  I'm having a war 
[03:15:00]  dad  I said  who with  he said  five of my  friends  I said  where are they  one was in  America  one was in  Australia  two were down  the road  in other houses  they were all  talking to each  other through  their earphones  and playing a war  game  it was a proper  one for their  age group  like a junior  war game  thing  but they're in  four different  countries  and they're  10 years old  you're going to  tell me that  you're going to  have some crusty  old official in  the government  who's going to  stop this guy  getting information  forget it  so  the difference in  China is  Chinese  you're going to  end up in 
[03:15:30]  China  very very soon  I'd say within  five years  with two different  populaces  half the country  of 1.3 billion  will be very rich  they'll be millionaires  and the other half  will be incredibly  poor  right now  that's where  it's a problem  but that's where  in a weird way  having a kind of  totalitarian regime  as they have in  China  where everything  is controlled  centrally by quite  a tough government  is almost essential  because if you don't  and you have the  kind of uprisings  you've seen in  Egypt and China  on a 20 times 
[03:16:00]  bigger scale  then the world  has a massive problem  so this is a very  interesting ongoing  debate here  the freedom of  young people  and the access  they now get  to the outer world  they never used to have  nobody in China  20 years ago  would have a clue  what was happening  in America  they wouldn't have a clue  now they know everything  yeah but how do you  look in a yellow bikini  Pierce because  we have Brooklyn Decker  here  and holy shit  I don't know  what you're up for this  but I wouldn't mind  having a little  fashion show  where we compare notes  I'm finding this  more interesting  I have to say  I actually continue  please  I have to ask a question 
[03:16:30]  about your name  it's obviously  a great name  Brooklyn  that's your real name  you didn't  are your parents  kind of like hippies  that's like a really  kind of a cool name  were you born in Brooklyn  no I live there  were you conceived in Brooklyn  no none of the above  the Beckhams for example  always call their kids  after places they would  conceive  oh god  I'd be men's room  Norton  we're not sure  what Romeo is all about  they must have been  watching up a Shakespearean  play at the time  well the obvious question  why Brooklyn  I'm named after a horse  yeah not good  wow  my mom's best friend 
[03:17:00]  sorry  your secretary at Decker  would have sounded awful  my mom's best friend  had a horse named Brooke  and she always loved the name  so as a joke  my dad suggested Brooklyn  and they had never been  to New York  so it really has nothing  to do with the city  but now I live there  it's almost like  is it two names  Brooke Lynn  no it's Brooklyn  it's Brooke Lynn  Danielle Decker  excellent  yeah  that's good  yeah how do you know  you gotta know  when you name a girl Brooklyn  that she's gotta turn out pretty  but because she's beautiful  it works  no because it's kind of  a cool name  it's like 
[03:17:30]  it's kind of a cool name  or like a sandwich shop name  like I could be  a sandwich  it sounds like a sandwich  get the Brooklyn Decker  for a limited time  at Subway  I know it sounds like a sandwich  I'm telling you  but it works on a beautiful woman  like if you came in  and you were like  you ate 420  people were like  come on stop  that name  fix it  because it just works for you  yeah  I agree with that  thank you  yeah  well look at  gentlemen I'm gonna have to  leg it  I'm afraid  yeah I hear you  we are too  I think we're wrapping up  it's been wonderful  it's at the end  we're at 10 o'clock  I didn't know that 
[03:18:00]  what do people need to know  about the movie  I saw it  I'm not a rom-com guy  I'm not gonna lie to you  but I liked it  I really did like it  it's not necessarily a rom-com  it is  there's some jokes in there  yeah it's good for guys too  I liked it  to stay on their film  yeah  I mean really  we have some great guys in it  comedian Kevin Neal  and Nick Swartz  and Adam Sandler  Kevin Neal was hilarious  he was only on for two minutes  I think  and he was hilarious  but if we're just gonna get this  on DVD or something  and you want to fast forward  to the crucial bit  when are you on the beach  right in the beginning  and she wears a lot of bikinis 
[03:18:30]  and a lot of  but I'm not a school teacher  I do have clothes on  I do have clothes on  I didn't pay attention  to those scenes  yeah but no  it's actually great  because Nicole Kidman  and Jennifer Aniston  they wear coconut bras  and have like a hula off  in coconut bras  so I would actually go for them  instead of singing  it's like a Hawaiian episode  of the Brady Bunch  sort of  I didn't realize how hot  Jennifer Aniston still was  she's hot  without her clothes on  right  I know  holy shit  I couldn't stop staring  really  yeah  no really  she looks great  she really does 
[03:19:00]  tell us more  a lot of cameos  a lot of other guys  in this movie  yeah it's a great  I mean it's a good  it's a funny film  and they wanted to make it  come out the week after Super Bowl  so it would give the guys  something to do  and it has really  three great great characters  for women  which I find so unusual  these days in movies  to have really  you know  three strong  comedic characters  for women  and we have that  and I'm just  it's my first film  I'm really proud of it  and yeah  that's a good first film  yeah  could have been  like a sci-fi original  I'm telling you  I'm still pinching myself 
[03:19:30]  yeah it's really exciting  it's like oh  I'm in Mega Gator  yeah  hey that would have been  a good start  that would have been  a good start  I'm telling you  that's a good start  I'm not one to  turn up my nose  to any movies  but yeah  Adam gave me  a really great  a great chance at this  and we had a really  good time shooting it  so  can you look pretty  they want to picture  you on Twitter  and Piers  get out of this picture  I thought you meant me  you're on every night  CNN you're on  five nights a week  thank you  seven nights a week  three times a day 
[03:20:00]  seven times a week  relax  two weeks of the year  here's two quick questions  who do you got this week  on CNN  we've got a big one  on Wednesday  a first live show  in front of an audience  Donald Trump  Donald Trump  in front of an audience  your old boss  then we've got  the King's Speech special  with Colin Firth  and Geoffrey Rush  and Helena Bonham Carter  so that's a great show  and then I think it's  Rod Stewart on the anchor leg  back at his  Beverly Hills mansion  oh wow  you're going to ask him  about some of his  relationships  I most certainly am  his many relationships  I actually asked him  I said what is your problem  with redheads and brunettes 
[03:20:30]  and he said sorry  I went we've only ever  married blondes  what's the matter with you  what do you want against him  and he goes into this  really tortured explanation  for why he has nothing  against redheads  and brunettes  oh really  and one other question  you and Madonna  where are you at  she's incredibly annoying  and banned for life  from my show  wow  nice  why do I want Madonna  when I can have  Brooklyn here  wow  would you like to hear  somebody wavering  in and out of a British accent  that's why I love Madonna  if Madonna  Madonna goes on  bended knee in Times Square  and begs forgiveness  I might reconsider  but currently she 
[03:21:00]  and Heather Mills McCartney  are on my banned list  well you ain't gonna get  the bended knee from her  sorry Brooklyn  I'm sorry you had to hear that  we've got to put it  in the gutter every so long  she might hold it up  and wave it at you  alright  she's laughing though  she kind of liked it  she's a horrible woman  good for you  I introduced Heather Mills  to Paul McCartney  that's why I have this  problem with her  I actually introduced her  did you really?  Paul was like  thanks mate  it cost me 50 million dollars  shame on you  exactly  that's why she has to be banned 
[03:21:30]  it's my only way  of getting back in with some bull  Brooklyn you can  disavow any knowledge  of this interview  absolutely not  I'm hanging on to everyone  don't worry about it  I think your people  are getting a little nervous  they're pointing at watches  out there  they're not looking at watches  they're going  stop it  get her out  what did Madonna do to you?  didn't you try to get her  on the show?  you know what it is  it's a criminal invasion  of a British accent  that she's now adopted  I'm just not having it  so she has to be banned  for appallingly insult  to the British nation  with this fake accent  that's it
