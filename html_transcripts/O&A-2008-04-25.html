<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast centered heavily around Anthony Cumia's birthday celebration, which was a recurring theme throughout the entire show.  The studio was decorated with a military theme, and guests included Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neal, and Billy Mac, a retired NYPD officer.  The show began with lighthearted banter, including reenacting childish acts and jokes about Jim Norton's appearance.  Omelets from Basil T's were enjoyed in the studio.  A significant portion focused on the upcoming verdict in the Sean Bell shooting case, sparking a debate between Anthony, Patrice, and Billy Mac, the latter providing detailed commentary from his law enforcement perspective.  This led to discussions about racial bias in policing and media portrayals of crime. Patrice O'Neal shared extensive personal experiences and perspectives on covert racism and interracial relationships, with tangents on politics (mentioning Obama and Hillary Clinton) and comedic anecdotes about racial dynamics, including a humorous story about a black bill collector.  The segment concluded with more birthday wishes for Anthony and promotion of Patrice's upcoming shows.

The show then shifted to a discussion of Wesley Snipes' tax evasion conviction and prison sentence, with jokes about his prolific straight-to-DVD action films, particularly those stemming from the *Blade* franchise.  The hosts and Patrice speculated on Snipes' prison life.  A call from Scorch, a former radio personality, featured a rumor (later retracted) about Ozone's sex change, leading to the hosts fact-checking this using online photos.  Further birthday messages for Anthony followed, including calls from Maury Povich, Ronnie "The Limo Driver" Bennington, and Bob Saget, all featuring humorous anecdotes.  The ongoing feud with Page Six and Fez Whatley's mental state were also mentioned.  The language throughout this segment, as in much of the show, was highly offensive, with frequent use of racial, sexual, and other potentially sensitive humor.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on Anthony's birthday celebration at the Borgata in Atlantic City, with Patrice O'Neal in studio.  A caller, "June 21st," was playfully reunited with his ex-girlfriend, who was seated in the front row.  The hosts attempted to get various celebrities to call in birthday wishes.  E-Rock's exaggerated reaction to the smell of bacon was a recurring bit.  Patrice O'Neal's past web show and dismissal were discussed.  The impending Sean Bell verdict and potential for civil unrest were repeatedly mentioned, interspersed with crude racial humor.  Fez from Ron and Fez called in, with discussions about his personal life and accusations of him visiting pornography websites during the interview.  A woman was brought into the studio, sparking further sexually charged commentary.  Speculation on the Sean Bell verdict and potential reactions continued, alongside more off-color humor and pop culture references.

A segment focused on the Illuminati, sparked by a claim about a hidden image on a $20 bill. This conversation segued into racial issues, police brutality, and conspiracy theories.  Patrice O'Neal contributed significantly to the often-rambling and offensive discussion, which included numerous racial slurs and crude jokes.  Louis C.K. was a guest in the studio, promoting his projects.  Kevin Smith and Joe Rogan called in to wish Anthony a happy birthday, leading to conversations about gun ownership, martial arts, and conspiracy theories.  A Freemason called in, offering a perspective on the Freemasons and debunking some Illuminati claims.  Further discussion of mixed martial arts fighters concluded the segment.

Another segment featured a discussion of mixed martial arts and boxing, with Louis C.K. in studio.  Louie C.K. discussed his boxing training, including sparring with female professional fighters, and Joe Rogan (calling in) shared anecdotes about physical altercations.  This transitioned into a highly offensive and racially charged discussion on racial preferences in dating and pornography, fueled by Patrice O'Neal's commentary.  Numerous explicit descriptions of pornography were given.  The segment concluded with the "What's Up, Eastside David's Boss?" game, where Eastside David had inserted a birthday balloon into his rectum, culminating in him vomiting.

A final segment involved a discussion about someone inserting a Mylar balloon into their anus, with Patrice O'Neal drawing parallels to "jackass white boys".  Patrice discussed his role in a movie and a birthday card he refused to touch.  An AshleyMadison.com advertisement aired, prompting more offensive jokes.  Numerous offensive "runner-up" lines of the day were presented. The show concluded with a happy birthday segment for Anthony Cumia, followed by more offensive jokes and a graphic segment titled "Goofy gags to plan your uncircumcised pals," involving cruel and potentially harmful pranks. Patrice O'Neal remained a guest throughout.

[00:04:00]  in there  nice  not one of those  egg white things  yolk and all  it's my birthday  you know what I'm  going to do for you  Anthony  I'm going to go out  by costume  as the target guy  the guy that's  on every target  I shoot at  the black target guy  I'm going to wear that  just for you today  you're pretty much  wearing it  and I'm going to  walk back and forth  I'm going to just  slide back and forth  put it this way  if you were nude  you'd be wearing it  wow  today I promise  I'm even  this is how happy 
[00:04:30]  I am for Anthony  I'm going to let  him be racist  without even rebuttal  that is probably  the best gift  I've ever been given  I'm going to allow  you to be  I'm going to be  apologist guy today  wow  I'm not going to  defend nothing black  today  I'm going to allow  you for your birthday  this is my birthday  gift to you  to say you are right  about anything  well you know what  Planned Parenthood  you are right  you might have  picked the wrong  day to come up  with that  why  the Sean Bell  oh the verdict 
[00:05:00]  is ready to come  out today  six flags  more flags  more fun  more fun  for you  it's more fun  six flags  my birthday  gets six flags  already  because of what  Patrice said  yeah  more fun  so you're going to  allow him to be a racist  I'm going to allow him  to be a racist  with no rebuttal  with no black man  rebuttal  what I'm going to do  is I'm just going to  actually fish out  make sure you have  good reasoning  for what you're saying  just to understand it  I can go with that 
[00:05:30]  I'm going to listen  to your points today  no black rebuttal  on the show  what do you think  about the Sean Bell  situation  the verdict's coming out  today  the verdict's coming out  now what are  what are the  what's the story  I know what the story is  yeah the officers  are on trial  for shooting  and killing  Sean Bell  and shooting  a bunch of his  friends that were  in the car  along with him  a lot of shots  were fired  a lot of shots  from the evidence 
[00:06:00]  I've heard  now I wasn't  in the courtroom  of course  so I didn't get  to hear it at all  but from the evidence  that has been  given to the public  and texted to me  I know  teasing of course  I think  and this is a tough  thing because  a lot of times  on the outside  it doesn't look  like justification  but when you  really look at it  all the police  really need  is the idea  that their lives 
[00:06:30]  were being threatened  the reality of that  is secondary  I think  they thought  their lives  were being threatened  enough  sufficiently to unload  thousands of shots  you know something  everyone says that  you look at the  magazine  of an officer's gun  and when you got  four cops or so  shooting  they could add up  pretty quickly  pretty quickly  so just  and when the car  is still moving  toward you  you know 
[00:07:00]  you're gonna  keep shooting  and you're hearing  shots  that's the thing too  in these circumstances  you're hearing shots  they could be  your partner's shots  so you don't know  if they're still  coming at you  you absolutely believe  that the person  you're shooting at  has a gun  so all hell  breaks loose  whether some things  weren't handled  the way they were  supposed to be  I'll agree with that  but if these guys  who go out there  on a daily basis  not trying to get  themselves thrown  in prison  by being these 
[00:07:30]  racist cops  that are just  shooting at young  black men  I don't think  they want to  throw their lives  away like that  it's a situation  it happens  it's part of  the toughness  that it is  to be in law  enforcement  all I have to say  to this is  happy birthday  wow  thank you  no way  six flags  no way  got six flags  that response  I'd like to ask  Clint Eastwood  from In the Line of Fire  what he thinks  obviously Kenny 
[00:08:00]  isn't here today  I'd like to ask  protected JFK  on his last ride  face  what he thinks  of the Sean Bell  situation  I gotta explain  for everybody  Club Story  Kenny's on the road  with Jim Norton  they're up in Chicago  for the weekend  so we got  we got Billy Mack  in studio today  filling in for Kenny  and you had a lot  of observations  when you met him  for the first time  in the office  a mere hour  I'd like to ask  Sam Elliott  from Tombstone  what he thinks 
[00:08:30]  of the whole  Sean Bell thing  and our birthday  boy's synopsis  of that  see now I know  what you're doing  you're allowing  Anthony to have  free reign today  but you're not  letting Anthony  off the hook  you're gonna  rebuttal Anthony  through our  five pal  Bill Mack  no I'm not  I'm just gonna ask  this man here  who seems like  a seasoned gentleman  what did you call him  when you went  into the office today  well I forgot  he just  you forget 
[00:09:00]  I just forgot  I'm sorry  the tree kills  in the office  and I'm like  let's do a little  of this on the air  and he forgets  I believe it was  you were killing  in the office  I believe it was  there he is  my worst nightmare  that's where it started  and then he said  something about  Disney World  he looks like  the head  the head security  god  like the head  of security  at Disneyland  he comes in  when security  is really bad  he comes in  and fixes it  he holds up  all the security  you see these  balloons right here  now you can 
[00:09:30]  take the helium  out  put it in your mouth  smuggle it in  and use  a Donald Duck doll  blow it on it  light it on fire  bomb  what is going on here  he's like  Kenny's a cop  where it's like  he's from the neighborhood  this guy  Billy Mac  is a cop  he's your worst  nightmare cop  he's a real cop  you think he  went old school  back in the day  let me tell you  Billy has level 14 clearance 
[00:10:00]  there's something  somewhere where he  it recognizes his eyeballs  the retinal scan  he got  that's how he gets  in his house  and his kids  can't get in  unless they recognize  their eyeballs  he frits his kids  in the morning  he's probably seen  and done some  horrific things  but sleeps like  a baby every night  he is  not one nightmare  in that head  there's nothing  in his past  that you can catch him  for  he's just been a cop 
[00:10:30]  his whole life  Billy Mac  is not playing  he's the kind of guy  you know  and this is what I'm saying  I don't need  I ask everybody  all my cop  you know  people  cops I meet  because I'm in comedy  yeah  I ask them for the  FOP cards  and everything  you don't need to do that  all you gotta do  is say I know  Billy Mac  and then you're off  the hook  you can go  I guarantee  Billy Mac's name  you can go  100 on a New York  thruway  and no one's gonna  no one's gonna bother  with Billy Mac's name  Billy Mac  hey  you can have  zero tint  on your front windows 
[00:11:00]  with Billy Mac  zero tint  all I have to do  is roll it down  till they see my eyebrows  and go Billy Mac  and then roll it back up  yeah  that's all  that's all I got  for you today  I know Billy Mac  I got places to go  he has definitely  run on the side  of some presidential cars  he's the dive  in front of the  bullet guy  that's Billy Mac  he's been shot  75 times  he makes a pretty 
[00:11:30]  good point  because I've seen  you kind of  undercover  and it's so obvious  that you're not  undercover  yeah  in Harlem  he goes  is there any  marijuana here  I'm looking  for some  reefer  hey  who got the blow  who got the white  stuff around here  because I  I am not a cop  hey Billy  have you trained  people  have you trained  officers  yeah  Billy 
[00:12:00]  of course he has  he's the real deal  that guy right there  there's no way  retired right  Billy  and he's only 42  that means he's been  a cop  he's been a cop  since he was 13  now he just does  security conferences  that's how he makes  $450,000 a year  hold on a minute  he also runs  the River Rose  let's not forget  right Billy  that's true  the River Rose  we go out on that  every 4th of July  watch the fireworks 
[00:12:30]  in front of the UN  and he may have had  a gay cruise or two  in his day  not Billy Mac  personally  but because he runs  the River Rose  he may have booked  a party  of fine gentlemen  that's only so he knows  where they all are  wanted to cruise  around the harbor  I hear a bunch of  Jamaicans too  a lot of Jamaicans  a lot of take out  his boat  the River Rose  that's the new government way  Billy still works  with the government  that's their way  I've taken the census  he books 75 boats 
[00:13:00]  and they all fill  with Jamaicans  he goes  he goes  there's 412  living there now  write it down  send it in  he doesn't care  he has a dossier  he paints his face black  and puts dreadlocks on it  he's like  hey man  you enjoying yourself  so that's Billy Mac  everyone  you're just obsessed  with Billy Mac  I love it  dude because  when I came in  I'm like what the  he came out of nowhere too 
[00:13:30]  yeah  like we sitting there  we talking about things  and then all of a sudden  I'm like  this guy  you know like  Halloween  like he just  the shake was there  I looked up  I had my  you know my peripheral  and he's just standing there  completely straight up and down  you know  like he just  like he's part of the  you ever see  the untouchables  I do not  approve  of your methods  Billy 
[00:14:00]  it's one of those cops  that fight four Mexicans  on the side of a Texas highway  and they try to  and he just  he cuffs them all  with  with the plastic cuffs  not the handcuffs  yeah with the zip strips  with the zip strips  and you know  he makes them nice and tight too  oh yeah  he's not gonna give you any leeway  he's not giving you any leeway  oh man  so Billy  have you ever been  frightened enough  to unload  all your entire clip  uh yeah  really 
[00:14:30]  what would be a situation  to make you scared enough  to unload the entire clip  uh  search one  narcotics rate  hmm  now would Sean Bell's  situation had a cause  in your opinion  would you have been  nervous enough  without  without implicating  without implicating  the other cops  and all that stuff  personally  do you think  listening to this situation  knowing about it  do you think  you would have been  nervous enough  to unload  your clip  most definitely  in that situation  absolutely  this is just  personal feeling  absolutely 
[00:15:00]  removing yourself  from the brotherhood  of cops  just your personal  your personal feeling  you you you would have  unloaded in that situation  not having been there  but just like Anthony said  just getting text messages  and reading what  you know what the thing is  the reason the detectives  were out there in the  first place  so they were in the  in the bar  because the place  was just a haven  for narcotics  apparently  and uh  they were running  you know  a little sting operation  in there  a little  uh 
[00:15:30]  um  observation  see what's going on  maybe make a drug bust  and the reason they went  outside in the first place  with Sean Bell  and the rest of his friends  is they heard  uh  one of them say  get my gun  so now that instantly  puts in their head  that there's a gun involved  so they go outside  they confront the car  uh  the car comes  towards them  because now  it could also be  that Sean Bell  and his buddies  didn't know who the hell 
[00:16:00]  this was  because they weren't  in uniform  so you get a bunch of guys  pulling guns on you  you know  maybe you think  they're just gonna kill you  for some reason  maybe you got people  that aren't friendly with you  so you step on the gas  to run them over  that it doesn't mean  he thought they were cops  either  you know  he might have just thought  they were thugs  but now the cops  are justified  in doing what they did  just as a reaction  to having a car  come at them  now once you start  hearing gunfire  and you have that  in your head  it wasn't all white cops 
[00:16:30]  was it  it wasn't a couple  of Puerto Ricans  yeah a couple  of Hispanic guys  a black guy  so once you start  hearing gunfire  with that in your head  that there was a gun  because you heard  somebody say  that there was a gun  and the car  lunging towards you  guys are gonna unload  I mean  it's  it was a mistake  but it was  justified  in my opinion  we're gonna find out  at 9 o'clock today  we'll find out  9 o'clock  and all the NYPD  that by the way 
[00:17:00]  is why  Billy Mack  is here  because Kenny  couldn't make it  there are other people  that are on the force  that do stand in  for Kenny occasionally  but every cop  has been called in  to wait  for the verdict  you won't find  a cop  there is not a cop  home right now  I was gonna say  there ain't a cop  home with his kids  there's not a cop  friggin'  washing his car today  nobody wants  Rodney King  things happening  right  they will be found 
[00:17:30]  guilty for this  you think based on  the fact that  they don't wanna make  a race problem  what do you  what do you think  that's  wait let me not  let me  let me  let me take a deep breath  happy birthday  let me take a deep breath  see I knew this one last  no no no  it's last  I knew this one last  happy birthday  I'm just saying  you said you would  give Anthony free reign  today  no I didn't say free reign  I just said no rebuttal  but I will  I will ask  no rebuttal is  you mother  you know  I'm just saying  I'm just asking 
[00:18:00]  I do enjoy that  with you Patrice  so maybe that would be  a good birthday present  for me to just kinda  you know cause I like  our discussion  sure  here's the thing  that sometimes  when it's not your birthday  I'm willing  I'm willing to listen  oh my  I knew this one last  we  we've been on  20 minutes  it lasted  let's be honest  for about  no no  you can't even call it  15 minutes  cause that 15 minutes  was used up  making fun of 
[00:18:30]  poor Billy Mac  oh god damn  Billy Mac  how about after the break  you give your rebuttal  oh I would like to hear that  cause I know how  you get a little wordy  and you know  we got a break already  that's fair  wow  that's fair  this won't be wordy  but it's fair  I will do that  I'll just  shut up and wait  I think  yeah  alright  we'll get  we'll continue  with this discussion  after the break  is that alright  yes sir  you sure  happy birthday  Anthony  thank you  speaking of which  little Jimmy Norton  for Anthony  happy birthday  to you 
[00:19:00]  happy birthday  to you  happy birthday  dear Anthony  happy birthday  to you  you're off  you really are the worst  stupid Patrice  even makes  fish talk  interesting  you got a true talent  my friend  we'll do that break later 
[00:19:30]  good morning  it's the Opie and Anthony show  by the way  phone number  877-212-ON-A  here's the reset  it's Anthony's birthday  he's celebrating  his 44th birthday  44th birthday  we got the fine folks  from Basil T's  in studio  Basil T's  brew pub  and Italian grill  doing a little  something different  with the omelets  today my friend  very tasty  whatever that  little sausage  is  that Italian sausage  what is it called  I don't know  Italian sausage 
[00:20:00]  no it's  washeriso  oh very nice  and of course  Basil T's  1171 Hooper Avenue  in Tom's River  New Jersey  alright  I think that might have  been the best omelet  I've had in a long time  that was a good one  and then Patrice  you know  he can't allow  everyone else  to have a fine omelet  he tells the guy  make sure you make  E-Rocks a little  a little worse than mine  so I feel like  I was really getting  the best of the best  yeah I don't want  E-Rocks to have  the same omelet I have  how dare you  how dare you  how dare you 
[00:20:30]  I want my omelet  to be special  just a little less love  so Sean Bell  you have  the rebuttal  to what Anthony  was saying  Anthony's basically  saying that these guys  are going to be  acquitted today  no I didn't say  they were going  to be acquitted  I said  my personal opinion  is that there was  justification  for the shooting  what do you think  is going to happen  some mistakes  were made  but I think  they'll be acquitted  I'm thinking  lesser charges  I think they've got  to throw  you think  they've got  see that  but that isn't  that isn't  how justice 
[00:21:00]  is supposed to work  I understand that  you don't give people  you don't  not accuse them  convict them  of crimes  based on  how it might  anger people  you can't do that  that's not the way  it's supposed to work  that's where  I just wanted to say  yes sir  happy birthday  thank you  and my birthday gift  to you  is racism  you're allowing me  to be  more racist  than I usually get away with  one of the more frustrating  things  as I get older  in life  I'm a little less  frustrated with  white people 
[00:21:30]  as I get older  about the average stuff  it's nice  there are things  the covert  nature  of  of racism  the covertness  now  okay  I'm trying to learn  more about that  because there's a lot  of what black people  feel  that are  it's  it's  it's not  acknowledged  because  it's really  not over  it's not like  this  these  you know  guns and hats  and everything  and hangings  as much as it is 
[00:22:00]  like a feeling  that is  it's  devalued  meaning  I think that  white people  don't see the world  for that  paranoia  white people  don't have enough  and I don't mean  your paranoia  that black people  gonna come in  and kill everybody  which is justified  to white people  and they understand  it  that a black man  is gonna come  through the window  and rape the whole family  and the dog  yeah  they rape rover  oh my god  damn  they're awful 
[00:22:30]  but  but the  the paranoia  that you dismiss  black paranoia  as nonsense  where you go  dude  this is wrong  and I don't believe  that you could be  that scared  and  it was something  involved with  a slight bit  of wrongness  and that  that  that you  you said  that it wouldn't be  I'm saying  that it's gonna be  they're gonna find  them guilty  they might find  them guilty  of lesser charges  or something  based solely on  just  keep everybody 
[00:23:00]  happy  happy  but that isn't  the way it's supposed  to work  it's not the way  it's supposed to work  but that's how  it seems to be  communism  is a great idea  if it wasn't  for the people  yeah  if it wasn't  for the fact  people run it  it's  the idea  of everybody  having something  is a fine idea  philosophy  but  the idea  that  okay  these guys  the jury  finds them  on a certain level  not guilty  and you go  you know  we think  they have justification  let them go  if you don't think 
[00:23:30]  that people  are going  hey man  you know  we might  have to  you know  send these guys  at least find them  guilty  so there's no problems  of course  it shouldn't be  like that  but  again  black people's  response  to a lot  of stuff  is  is our  history  we can't  just  we can't  devalue  jews don't  have to  devalue  the holocaust  why do black  people always  have to  devalue  our history  oh sorry  happy birthday  why do we  have to  devalue 
[00:24:00]  I know  it's case  for case  but the  history of it  will make you  think differently  about whether  like if it  wasn't a history  of nonsense  like this  yeah  if it  wasn't for  Amadou Diallo  or the other  Haitian dude  yeah  you know  we wouldn't  we'd go  okay maybe  maybe you can  understand that  do you think  though with  what police  deal with  in major  cities  in urban  cities  on a daily 
[00:24:30]  basis  make them  a little more  leery  when they come  up upon  young black  men  absolutely  than they do  when they come  up upon  a little  white boy  or something  yes  and the same  thing  for me  I mean  I got more  fear  and in  fairness  I should be  more afraid  of a middle  aged white  guy  because there's  a better  chance that  he'll do  something  to me  than you  know  how is  that  that's  crazy  how about  the fact  that you  guys  at any  point  will shoot  everybody 
[00:25:00]  in the  mall  like  when we  shoot  somebody  there's  sometimes  there's  an actual  purpose  right  there he  go  there he  go  I'm gonna  kill him  the idea  is not  to go  in  and kill  strangers  that represent  society  that's the  MO of the  crazy white  guy but that  is  but that is  something  very rarely  you see that  on the news  it happens  yes  very rarely  you'll get  that  and it's a  big story  because it 
[00:25:30]  doesn't happen  all the time  but on a  daily basis  now a lot  of black  people have  said that  the media  does this  on purpose  they want  fear out  there  you don't  think so  but all  you see  is here's  a surveillance  camera from  last night's  robbery  here's  look here's  the rapist  they're bringing  out  here's this  guy  here's that  guy  and the  majority  of the  times  it's a  young to  middle age  black guy  and it gets  people  like look at  this  caught on  tape  let's take  a look  I don't 
[00:26:00]  know  oh  well  okay  that looks  like  Pechanga  from  but how  about the  stop  the stop  animation  videos  of the  white girl  that went  into  Walmart  and comes  out  and she  was  followed  by a  white boy  and then  she ends  up  missing  in  the shrubs  young white  guys love  killing young  white girls  but there's  no natural  there's no  primitive fear  that white  people will  have  I say that  all the time  that when a  young woman 
[00:26:30]  especially in a  crowded parking  lot is going  to her car  she's stupid  if she just  tra-la-laws her  way to the  car without  taking a look  around  because she  should be  fearful  that some  idiot is  going to  come in  and blind  side her  and throw  her into  the car  and for the  most part  okay  and this  is another  thing  that guy  what's that  guy  the guy  that just  kidnapped  and killed  black dude  kidnapped  and killed  the white  girl in  North Carolina  and the  goofy idiot  went and  tried to  hide his  face  use her  ATM 
[00:27:00]  card  with the  bill of  his hat  good one  it's very  rare  very rare  that a black  guy will  kidnap a  white woman  and kill her  like it just  doesn't really  happen  it happens  there's usually  the kidnapping  the rape  and then the  use of the  ATM card  which of course  does that  actually happen  I've seen  it in the  news  quite often  black dude  to white  woman  you know  what I mean  I'm just  saying that  the paranoia  that we  have  you know  that old  saying  you know 
[00:27:30]  just because  I'm paranoid  doesn't mean  somebody ain't  trying to kill  me  right  there's a  new kind  of racism  a new  kind  because white  people are  smart  I can't  you know  you did  you know  you did  enslavers  it can't be  dumb  to enslave  a people  that actually  outnumber you  you know  what I mean  you're smart  enough to  change things  without knowing  like right now  the word  American  means white  people  like if you're  not smart  enough to  know that  then you  should be 
[00:28:00]  now  you know  what I mean  where  I can't  believe  what's the  guy  Obama's  preacher  I can't  believe  Americans  are upset  which is the  new buzzword  for white  people  now black  people ain't  American  just because  I complain  about  America  doesn't  come up  with that  conclusion  exactly  this whole  crazy  paranoia  but  it's like  the right  and the left  you know  who created  that man 
[00:28:30]  is really  I saw it on  phone with  David Duke  because David Duke  is like man  I really  want to be  a politician  and I really  hate niggas  now  how am I  going to be  a politician  and be ahead  of a clan  you know  what I'm  going to do  I'm going to  create this  thing now  called  conservative  and right  now the right  is  is  is quote unquote  the racist  part  and the liberals  are the  the  inclusion  the party  of inclusion 
[00:29:00]  yes  and now it's  this fight  that's on a  higher level  than like  God  you know  there's no more  deliverance guys  who are the  racists  now it's just  you know  suit and tie  know how to  communicate  but it's the  same kind of  thing  going on  I gotta agree  with you  there is more  of a covert  racism going on  because the  overt racism  is taboo  you can't do  that anymore  it's gone  and that's  and that  and unbelievably  that's frustrating  white society  that I can't  just come on out 
[00:29:30]  this is why  I know  Obama's not  going to be  president  but the only  chance he has  is the fact  that Hillary  Clinton  is the  worst  communicator  I've ever  seen  remember  the caucus  with uh  with uh  Willie Horton  oh yeah  and how he  lost that  they threw  that out  the the news  has been  throwing out  at least  seven things  that should  have Obama  done  and Hillary  Clinton is  so awful  as the 
[00:30:00]  president said  that's better  than me  yeah  well  if I can't  get out  of the kitchen  as other  presidents  that you  love better  than you'll  ever love  me  said  she is  I'm  bowling  you know  at the  bowl  and I'll  have  I challenge  you  she can't  speak honestly  she is awful  did you see her  drink the shot  in the bar  with the beer  no  you didn't see her  in the bar  you know  just being one  of the people  and throwing back 
[00:30:30]  a shot  just trying  to hang  are you  are you  serious  like that's  why I don't  I know  he's not  gonna be  present  but the  only chance  he has  is that  the other  guy  he's just  nobody wants  to see him  McCain  McCain  just looks  like  he looks  you ever  see Darth  Vader  somebody had  to say  this  remember when  Darth Vader  in Jedi  became good  he took  his helmet  off  he looks  like  he's  Vader  without  the helmet  he looks  like Darth  Vader  without  the helmet  and he's 
[00:31:00]  just an  old  rotten  mess  he just  looks like  bad fruit  and Hillary  is awful  I want to  marry her  just so I  can cheat  on her  I want to  marry her  so I can  cheat on her  she's just  a person  just that  awful  and I  you know  Obama  it makes no  difference to me  really  but Obama  shouldn't even  have a chance  but he has a  chance  because the  white people  that you got  on the  planet now  are just  terrible 
[00:31:30]  but in  this country  I have  no  faith  in this  country  because it's  still dealing  with the  same thing  white people  are changing  against their  will  this is  against your  will  to actually  have to  like me  it's  against your  will  but a lot  of black  people don't  like white  people  we don't  hang out  we don't  hang out  except on  television  happy birthday  I just knew  that wasn't  going to work  that wasn't  directed towards  you Anthony  that was  directed towards 
[00:32:00]  society  and my  frustrations  wouldn't you  agree that  on the whole  the majority  of white  people hang  out with  other white  people  and black  people hang  out with  other black  people  it's very  rare that  there's this  crossover  except on  television  to sitcoms  where there's  the Asian  friend and  the black  friend and  everyone gets  together  but for the  most part  I think  humans  like any  other animal  on the face  of this earth  like hanging  out with  their own  peeps  but we're  the same  animal though  in a way 
[00:32:30]  we might be  different species  of the same  animal but  quite frankly  a lot of  guys that I  know and  are friendly  with and  friends with  are white  guys  you know  you're  different  not really  I think  you are  because there's  a lot of  black dudes  you know  I had a show  I did  it was called  Patrice O'Neill's  White People  and I  wanted to go  out  man I'll give  you an example  I wanted to go  out and just  disprove that 
[00:33:00]  we're these  people who  don't like  each other  it's pressure  not to like  a white person  and I know  that pressure  because a lot  of things  right now  in my life  that I  should have  learned  as a kid  you was  called  a fag  you know  if you  could say  that  you was  called  a punk  or what  typing  you typing  you a secretary  if I knew  where Italy  was on the  map  I was a  sucker  you know 
[00:33:30]  what I mean  growing up  and I  love  classic rock  you know  a lot of  white stuff  I'm into  but  growing up  man  you got  called names  if you was  too much  and I'm sure  the same  thing for  white people  you know  what I mean  but it's  made you  very educated  in white  people  you're very  educated  in white  people  but  covertly  I had to  grow up  covertly  sneaking  around  liking  white  stuff  and  the idea  of the show  was just  like  I would  just do  simple 
[00:34:00]  things  like  okay  I would  go  I would  make  a room  full of  black  kids  I would  go  okay  what's  the funniest  movie  I can  think of  of white  people  where I  go  okay  white people  love  this  movie  love  this  comedy  you know  as far  as our  humor  I say  I make  a room  full of  black  kids  and tape  them  watching  Midnight  Run  right  which I  think is  hilarious  yeah  or Seinfeld  curvy  enthusiasm  make them  watch it  and see  what happens  and if they  don't laugh  if they think  it's funny  and if they  don't  and the same  do white  people  make them 
[00:34:30]  watch  Friday  just sit  in a room  and watch  Friday  well that  movie's  hysterical  it's  a hilarious  movie  but you  know  you just  want to  see  or go  go to  a country  club  in Long  Island  find out  what their  the whole  what their  most  their top  five  selling  liquor  drinks  are  go to  go somewhere  in Harlem  and find out  what their  top five  bought  malt liquors  are  and then just  switch them  and just see  what happens  if black  people drink  a dry  martini  with an  olive twist  blah blah blah  and white  people drink  an Incredible  Hulk  which is 
[00:35:00]  Incredible Hulk  Alizé  mixed with  Hennessy  you know  and just  whatever  do that  stuff  because I  don't believe  that we're  as apart  as you  as you  think  as you  believe  we are  I just  think culturally  we've grown  up so  differently  that  white people  have a hard  time relating  to black  people and  vice versa  when I  when I'm  hanging out  and let's  like I  went to  Caroline's  show gets  done  then the  late show  comes in  and it's 
[00:35:30]  just  I walk  out and  the place  is  full of  just black  people  they're  waiting for  Paul Mooney  yeah  they're  waiting for  Paul Mooney  last weekend  after Norton  so I go up  to the bar  I get myself  a beer  but I  am so  conscious  that I  am in  just a  room full  of black  people  it's  it's  I am  I'm aware  of it  it's not  like  I'm just  welcoming  to white  people  dude  no I  understand  very nice  to you  I'm not  saying there  was a  problem  I'm not  saying I  felt  threatened  I'm not  saying anything 
[00:36:00]  but I  was aware  that I  was in  a room  full of  black  people  and then  I think  I'm like  why should  I have to  be aware  of that  why is  that like  something  that in  my mind  I can't  just be  in a room  full of  people  I'm in a  room full  of black  people  but why  I don't  know  now you  are in a  room full  of black  people  why can't  you just  go  it is  what it  is  yeah but  it is  what it  is  because that  goes against  human nature  it's a  different  situation  than he's  used to  so of  course  right away  you're  going to  be aware 
[00:36:30]  of your  surroundings  I all  of a sudden  thought  well I'm  the minority  and then  I'm thinking  this must  be what  it feels  like  if Anthony  ended up  in that  situation  a bunch  of times  then maybe  it would  become a  little more  familiar  and a little  more comfortable  but I  actually felt  the same  way walking  through  I'm like  wow this  is really  weird I  feel like  I'm in  another country  and I  couldn't get  into a  conversation  with anybody  like I  can't just  walk up  and talk  I don't  know the  lingo  I don't  know the  but that's  the thing  you don't  need lingo  to talk  about black  guys  I have 
[00:37:00]  to go  you know  if I'm  with a  bunch of  white people  do I  have to  don't do  the fake  white voice  this is  my  black person  imitating  the white  person  voice  every white  guy doesn't  go like  this to  me  but every  white  guy  this is  absolutely  every black  comedian  except for  Patrice  has that  bit  the white  guy talking  and it's  so  my  white  guy talk  is based  on the  context  of being  phony 
[00:37:30]  that is  the only  time I  do  white  guy  which is  who me  who me  I assure  you  comfortable  phony  you know  what I  mean  I don't  I like  I like  my  white  people  authentic  right  if you're  racist  I don't  want to  force you  to like  me  but I  would  like  for you  to at  least  give me  a reason  other than  like I've  seen  back in the  day  I mean I  watched so much  TV growing up  TV raised me  basically  I used to  watch the  old school  Geraldo Rivera  you know 
[00:38:00]  oh yeah  it was always  on there  when they used  to do racial  stuff  even Jerry  Springer  it would  always be  a frothing  at the mouth  idiot  racist  cracker  right  versus  Professor  Johnson  from the  black man  from Yale  versus  a foaming  idiot  Patrice  you make a  brilliant point  why not get  like a  blood  or a  crap  but it's like  I'm from  Princeton  I 
[00:38:30]  actually I  was a slave  human behavior  let me tell  you something  boy  you people  don't  you just  and then  well  it was that  voice  and it was  this girl  and she had  her clan  hat  and you had  Booker T  Washington  sitting there  and she goes  why are you  guys better  than us  she goes  I never forget  this is not even  paraphrasing  because you get  sickle cell  anemia  and we  don't  what  that's who  versus 
[00:39:00]  that's who  versus  Frederick  Douglas  because y'all  get sickle cell  anemia  and we  don't  I go  are you  serious  are you  serious  and that's  just  like  that's the  frustration  dude  it's like  even  and this is  to sum it  all up  this is  why  like the  Bill O'Reilly's  of the world  annoying me  because  the system  that black  people hate  and I say  this all the 
[00:39:30]  time  the system  we hate  it's not  you  we debate  and stuff  I don't  hate  you  I don't  hate  fan  because  he's a  white guy  I don't  hate  it's  the system  that really  gives a damn  about all  people  all people  are suffering  man  there's white  people that  suffer  but the fact  that this  country  uses race  to confuse  the masses  and the  thinking  it's some  race war  as opposed  to  you know  what  we in  the same  boat  that's the  frustration  who's more 
[00:40:00]  guilty of  perpetuating that  right now  in this day  and age  I think  and I feel  the context  in what you're  saying  and I'm  going to  stand up  and say  this  the purveyors  I put  O'Reilly  in the same  boat  as I put  Al Sharpton  where  it's  guys  Al Sharpton  is a  worldly  smart  dude  he's  a genius  I've  heard people  try to  get him  in corners  oh yeah  I know  he could  snake his  way out  of anything  and Bill  O'Reilly  who  says 
[00:40:30]  America  doesn't  like this  and it  makes a  poor  white  guy  in Nebraska  get angry  he feels  like he's  a white  guy  but he  ain't  and  Al  gets  black  people  who just  want  somebody  to talk  for them  that's  intelligent  he makes  them  go  yeah  get riled  up  where you  go  dude  you just  want to  go  this ain't  what we  should be  fighting  for  this  right  here  you know  what I  mean  so I  think  it's  both  sides  on a 
[00:41:00]  higher  level  that makes  the lower  level  fight  the wrong  fight  I think  if the lower  levels  came  if you  look at  life as  a pyramid  the bottom  is full  of the  regular  normal  people  just hang  out  working  trying to  get through  if those  people  ever got  educated  in terms  of  this is  ridiculous  then these  higher level  dudes  that get  ratings  off of  racism  they couldn't  exist  that's what  they do  it's like  profiteering  off of  racism  that's how  they make 
[00:41:30]  their living  so they  keep it  going  there you  go  so  Sean Bell  case  going down  today  going down  we'll see  they'll get  somebody's  gonna do  some kind  of time  you wanna  play some  bets  I do  and there's  no jury  by the way  you know  that right  yeah  judge is  deciding  judge is  oh  okay  then  forget about  it  no no  that's even  you know  if it was  a jury  yeah  a judge  is  decided  yeah  these guys  are gonna  be guilty  they might  not do 
[00:42:00]  time  they're gonna  be guilty  guilty  of  some of  the lesser  charges  I'm thinking  negligence  or something  we're gonna  find out  at 9  we really  gotta take  a break  it's Anthony's  birthday  he's  celebrating  40  what is  40  flurf  40  flurf  is what  I said  the other  day  we got  basil  teas  cooking  omelets  we got  lots of  things to  talk about  I wrote down  some of the  things you were  ranted about  in the office  Patrice  I'm gonna hit you  with a few of them  after the break  you're brilliant  you're brilliant  you're brilliant  when it comes to  relationships  oh yeah  well the  Wesley was  terrific 
[00:42:30]  and I also  wrote down  that you  want to  break up  with your  girl  just for  the summer  we'll get  into that  next  Opie and  Anthony  stay there  Opie and  Anthony  with  Patrice O'Neill  today  it's  Anthony's  birthday  basil teas  in the house  from  Tom's River  Hooper Avenue  in Tom's River  cooking up some  fine fine omelets  for everybody  can I plug a show  sir  can I plug a show  hell no  877-212-0&A 
[00:43:00]  is our phone number  what show Patrice  I'll do it  better later  but I'm at  Giggles  in Seattle  Washington  May 2nd and  3rd  Giggles  what do you want  I want to be  I want to say  NBC  I'll be on NBC  next week  but I'm at  Giggles  every time I hear  a name of one  of these clubs  I'm kind of  surprised  you gotta think  about it  you shouldn't  be surprised  because the guys  that are running  comedy clubs  weren't funny  enough to be  on the stage  but they have  to name their  own club  why would you  name your club 
[00:43:30]  Giggles  something with a  shack  Giggles  I don't know  what you should  name comedy clubs  but I know  Giggles  should be it  no  Bananas  we do a lot  of work  with Bananas  in Hasbrook  Heights  New Jersey  or wherever  the hell  but  awful  awful  yuckles  stress factory  is pretty good  stress factory  is a good  in New Brunswick  New Jersey  that's an okay  comedy  you should name  your club  after you  whatever you own  right  comedy connection  up there in Boston  not a bad name  no comedy connection  is good  I'm just going  with the name  Giggles  ain't too bad 
[00:44:00]  since I'm gonna be there  can you talk about it badly  after May 2nd and 3rd  no  it's not about that  they run bad joints  I just have a problem  with some of the names  I agree with you  Nick DiPaolo was in here  there's a new club  opening up  what was the name of it again  this was the worst one ever  it's something at 815  the comedy stop  at 815  or something like that  that's the address  it's at  yeah  but whenever somebody  plugs it  it obviously sounds like  I'm gonna be at  the blank stop  at 815  at 815  oh the name 
[00:44:30]  is something's comedy  at 815  at 815  how stupid are you  to name your club that  I just want to get  famous enough  to do the theater  across the street  yeah the real theater  just a thousand seater  is that the deal  in some of these cities  you got the little  comedy club  and then you got  the big theater  where like the stones  play  the end game  and Zeppelin  when they came to America  for the first time  Cliff Livingston's  Memorial Theater  you know  named after somebody  that got shot  in that town  Lincoln Theater 
[00:45:00]  and I just  you know  you just want to do it  but it's my first time  in Seattle  man Patrice  you're on fire today  Patrice bringing a lot  of energy  you're in a very good mood  yeah I was in a good mood  I haven't seen you guys  in a while  I have fun  in the morning  I didn't sleep  so I'm a little bit  I'll probably be real  finished by nine  don't say that  I'll crawl in the corner  but I'm trying my best  that'll give fire  to a dumb argument  that some of the listeners  like having  Wesley Snipes  yes 
[00:45:30]  Wesley Snipes  is going away  for three years  wow  he got off  very easy man  you think so  oh my god  three years  for what they were saying  three years  I think it was like  40 million  of you know  and he had some  aliens  just some  ridiculous  you know  Scientology reason  yeah some weird reason  why he wasn't  paying his taxes  why did your kid  die of a heart attack  wouldn't give him  aspirin  what  I don't believe in that  like he just didn't 
[00:46:00]  believe in taxes  yeah  like on some  Boston tea party  you're constantly  hearing these people  that'll say  also during tax time  you hear them go  you know dude  you don't have to  pay your taxes  it's not a law  so you know  you just don't pay  and then if they  try to get you  you say  you  say well  there's subsection  three  paragraph two  of this document  states that  it is not a law  to the  as they're cuffing  you  and taking you  away  yeah these guys  end up disappearing  from the neighborhood 
[00:46:30]  yeah fleecing you  of any money  you have left  the Illuminati  coming  the Illuminati  this is what I  found out about  the government  this is things  that you just go  it makes you want  to build a house  in the middle  of Alaska  and run it on  like whale blubber  like you just want  to disassociate  yourself from the  government  I'll agree with you  there  but when you pay  your mortgage now  you pay your  the bank pays  your taxes for you  because the government 
[00:47:00]  overrides  everything  so if they come  take your house  if you don't pay  your taxes  like if you pay  your mortgage  separate and then  your taxes  and you fall behind  on your taxes  for your house  the government  takes your house  and the bank's like  wait but that's my house  right  nah we're better  than you  they're better  than the bank  so I hate  answering to the  government  this magical thing  but it is  it's not you don't hate  you hate the people  you just hate people  that will come  and take your house 
[00:47:30]  and call you  and say give me  give me money  like I still got  people calling me  for bills  black people always  got somebody  calling them  for something  like hey  bills  you owe me  something from  82  negro  and then they  they call guys  my age  cause when I was  25 I used to go  how much I owe you  and then I just  I like rub the phone  on my nuts  you know what I mean  like hey did you hear that  they hear  I go you hear that  they're nice and frothy  right now  I go I have no credit 
[00:48:00]  anyway stupid  and then you hang up  it does catch up  to you  you know you turn  40 you're like  oh lord am I  I got a 710  I don't wanna go lower  and then  my credit score  what you  what you mean  I'm late  I done paid it  I done paid it  last month  when you're 25  you don't  you don't care  about a dumb  credit score  when I was 25  I would  I would masturbate  right  with them on the phone  you hear that  how's that sound

[00:50:30]  on the phone  because I would like  to make him miserable  not you  oh  here's my number  call me later  let's just talk  without this stuff  because I'm  this is  I'm not going to pay  how long did I say  I'm not going to pay  how long did I say  I owed it  since 1991  I go come on baby  we talked  we talked two nights  for about a good  12 hours all together  she came out  and saw me  you got game  and we had a great time  was she hot  god damn 
[00:51:00]  she was a mess  she wasn't a mess  no  she would be probably  a mess to you guys  but I was quite happy  yeah  she was a soldier  just for the way  you did it  that like  pumps the numbers  up higher  oh dude  I pulled  and when I went  to pick up  at the airport  it was a  she flew in  she flew in  oh my god  she flew in  dude  that's great  she was a soldier  we hung out  for the weekend  ta-ta  bought her a suitcase  with the money

[00:52:00]  it's just fantastic  but not as much  anymore  but  that  what were you  talking about  what were you  just talking about  nothing  we're just  listening to you  we're just listening  we started with  Wesley Snipe  who the hell  knows where  you go  the government  right  I gotta leave  bread trails  behind you  to make my  back to the  beginning of  where we were  I didn't go  I'm in the  dumbest tangent  but I just  remembered that  I did that  which actually 
[00:52:30]  made me excited  again  that's good  but you were  talking about  how I just  want to dump  my girl  for the summer  well no  we're talking  about Wesley  Snipe  we're gonna  steg into that  he gets  three years  you can't put  Blade away  for three years  and three federal  years  that's a long  time  here's the story  this is why  he said he  didn't feel like  he had to  pay taxes  the government  alleges  snipes  owes nearly  three million  dollars in  back taxes  for over  eight years  he engaged  in numerous  steps of  tax defiance 
[00:53:00]  conduct  everything from  submitting bogus  bills of exchange  to the government  to accusing  the government  that the actual  tax prosecutors  are at risk  if they go  after him  to filing  frivolous  documents  for years  on end  he claimed  he didn't have  to pay taxes  arguing  the government  has no right  to collect  he was acquitted  in february  of five  additional charges  including felony  tax fraud  and conspiracy  for now  snipes is free  he'll be notified 
[00:53:30]  when he has to  surrender to  authorities  that always  makes me laugh  it's like  well you're free  to go  you're gonna do  three years  we're gonna put  you in prison  for three years  but hang out  we'll give you  a call  when we want  you to  report in  what do you  do  bang everything  in sight  and how do  you sleep  knowing  staring at the  ceiling  just like  oh boy  do I get the  call tomorrow  morning  looking at  the clock  just going  there's another  minute of  freedom  I don't know  much about him  I haven't read  about him  over the years  but is he  alright in the 
[00:54:00]  head  why would he  take a chance  like that  to hold on  to his money  we all hate  paying taxes  but why would  you actually  take a chance  like that  to hold on  to your money  I tell you  what  you don't  understand  money  till much  later  where I'm  from  is that it  yeah  and Wesley  is from  where I'm  from  he's from  the hood  and you  just don't  I'm paying  for my  n word  rich  I was n word 
[00:54:30]  rich  Patrice you said  in the office  that this is  going to affect  the movie business  are you serious  in what way  I don't know  a lot of  empty  straight to  DVD cases  Steven Seagal  is like  yes  yeah  Wesley  Wesley's been  putting out  some garbage  he's been  putting out  movies called  everything has  aura at the  end  the  decapitator  the  agitator  the 
[00:55:00]  elevator  the  exterminator  now we gotta  look up his  movies  it's always him  yeah  well there is  the  detractor  and the  detonator  god  the guy  he's on  the first two  movies I see  detonator  and the  contractor  but  got the  aura at the  end  all the boxes  right  have him  there's a  there's a  an explosion  of something  blowing up 
[00:55:30]  behind it  right  and a white  woman that's  sweaty  like on the  side of him  on every  movie box  so you know  him and  van damme  who became  a  yeah  jean claude  van damme  and Stallone  has become a  straight to  video guy  yeah  a straight to  dvd guy  yep  for some reason  that doesn't  have it's still  just awful  to have your  movie go straight  to dvd  but it doesn't  have as big  a negative  thing as  it used to  it is bad  it's really bad 
[00:56:00]  but it used  to be just  crazy bad  but now  it's like  it has to  go even if  it goes to  the theater  for three  days  it has to  be  Wesley  first of all  how you make  enough money  from that to  owe the  government  millions  that was  his blade  money  because blade  has been the  only thing  that's not  been straight  to dvd  for him  yeah  blade is  huge  really fast  blade came  out ten  years ago  by the way  after that  it was  future sport  the art  of war  disappearing  acts  liberty

[01:16:30]  up pretty bad  there  I don't think  he messed up  he messed up  he said something  about Muslims  or some crap  and they fired  him  which is too  bad because  he's a great  radio show  guy  I do know  he went down  to Florida  which is odd  because I do  know that  so you're saying  he went out  and is  transgendered  well now he's  a great rock  jock but he's  not the whole  package anymore  get out of  here  I need  to get in  touch with  Ozone  immediately  because I  cannot accept  the fact 
[01:17:00]  that he  is now  a woman  what's his  name  Rebecca  Rebecca  why would he  choose Rebecca  of course  it was John  he could call  himself Joan  yeah  I don't even  know but I  swear he said  that he said  I used to  have the hot  girlfriends  and even back  then I felt  uncomfortable  yeah it's  kind of messed  up but  anyway  no you don't  but anyway  that score  should go  into colors  and numbers  right  I gotta get  to the bottom  he's not working  last I heard  he was running  a restaurant  or something

[01:23:00]  has the free time  to do that  yeah the picture's  12 days old  11 days old  yeah  here he's Rebecca  Rebecca now  I'll tell you this much  if Ozone  went through that whole thing  he wouldn't pick  the name Rebecca  no  like if he decided  I need to do this  that's why I knew  it was false  he would come up with like  he'd pick a hotter name  yeah Porsche  he'd be like  yeah a stripper name  Tanya  something like that  something  yeah exactly  we know Ozone 
[01:23:30]  Ozone  he'd pick a hot chick's name  that's right  not Rebecca  that's right  ah come on  now we gotta get Ozone  nobody calls me Rebecca  hey uh  E-Rock dude  alright  Newt  you did what  very good  sent some messages out  to Ozone  trying to get him on the show  alright cool  oh yeah  did you have an email link  or something  oh have him call the show  immediately  definitely like to hear  from Ozone  we haven't talked to this guy  in quite a while  alright  too funny  who doesn't love Scorch  the guy's great

[01:24:30]  bring on more steak  oh it's just good stuff  oh Jesus  I like to say  thank you Scorch  for that phone call  why are you doing  the Anthony mustache  like soul patch thing  oh  yeah  it kind of shaped  his birthday  he's got the white man  version  yeah  black guys  are doing the mustache  but you guys  are making it  a little tight  you guys  is that the deal  is that the look  to make it tight  it's the Earl Douglas  yeah the Earl Douglas  yeah  man that steak  was good 
[01:25:00]  thank you sir  oh my god  good stuff huh  alright we're gonna  get into Patrice  wanting to break up  with his girl  just for the summer  I think it's a  brilliant concept  I really do  and if anyone  could make it work  I really do  it's Patrice O'Neill  I really think  there's nothing  he can say  as far as  the relationship  goes with him  that is ridiculous  yeah  because you just  think and go  oh that's silly  oh wait  no it's Patrice  he can pull it off  what's brilliant  about his stuff  is like when he  first comes up 
[01:25:30]  with some of  these concepts  your first thought  yeah that's really  ridiculous  there's no way  within a second  you're like  whoa that's brilliant  and he's  he's making it work  right  amazing  we'll get into  that next  sure  maybe  if you can focus  do you have  ADD officially  what's your deal  I don't know  I have to  listen to the  first break  because we  started somewhere  next thing you know  we're talking about  Hillary Clinton  there's a lot of  stuff going on  I know  it goes in your mind  you just keep 
[01:26:00]  I do that all the  time though  all entertaining  not saying it  wasn't entertaining  you know what it  is it's it's a lot  of things happening  right now that I  actually give a damn  about like internally  like you go I could  talk about that for a  long time right I care  about it and there's  some stuff that you  know you just for a  while you just don't  give a damn we  some things you don't  care about it's hard  to talk about stuff  it's hard to come up  with things to talk  about when you don't  care it's definitely  just something that's  interesting you want to  talk about it the  Illuminati oh we'll  do Illuminati  and you know what we 
[01:26:30]  have a great Asian  bit that Patrice  Patrice has a brilliant  observation unfortunately  we can't do it over  here no for some  reason because the  Asians are off limits  they're off limits and  we're not allowed to  make fun of them  even if there's no  hate behind it we're  not allowed to go down  that road there's no  tsunami songs involved  no it used to be we  were afraid of you  know getting your asses  beat with karate  whenever Asians were  involved but now it's  lawyers for some reason  not anymore but there's  an Asian guy named  Kung Lee that's bringing 
[01:27:00]  karate back oh yeah  oh my goodness yeah  beat Frank Shanrock  on UFC it was an  MMA fight but he fights  like karate movies  really he fights like  now I gotta look him  up he fights like  karate movies all right  punch him up there  we rock on YouTube  we'll take a break but  yeah we have an Asian  thing that's pretty  pretty brilliant on  Patrice's part but I  don't know if you go  down that road we got  to get I guess we got  to get John Lou on the  phone and ask his 
[01:27:30]  permission yeah he was  the dude that got JV and  Elvis fired from this  radio station for doing  just just dumb not dumb  I didn't mean to say  dumb in that way but  just give that power  away just nobody wants  to go back just doing  good solid radio trying  to entertain people and  they get fired for it  because John Lou this  used to be hilarious  back in the day no  kidding don't do that  Patrice there's cameras  in here oh they're  watching our every move  you can't do that are  you crazy I was cleaning  out the corners of my  eyes also speaking of  JV and Elvis they're  gonna be on our show in  a week or two really 
[01:28:00]  yeah yeah yeah we're  gonna see what they're  up to since they've been  fired from their fine gig  here in New York City  Opie and Anthony stay  there got a very busy  morning are you accusing  me of talking too much  no no that would be  insane you want me to  eat steak so I shut my  mouth no no is that  steak almost ready  we'll be an Anthony on  your radio dial Patrice  O'Neill sitting in for  Jim Norton you entertain  the hell out of us you 
[01:28:30]  really do but what happens  after a show with Patrice  O'Neill I go home  exhausted mentally exhausted  from trying to keep up  with you my friend dude  you got a true talent for  this a little wordy at  times but a true talent  Jesus I'm a little and I  needed you today the only  thing that can stop me is  is hot is making my  cholesterol higher right you  saw that steak you're like  you know I gotta have some  of that well basil teas from  uh Tom's River Hooper Avenue 
[01:29:00]  and Tom's River doing a great  job once again for us today  pretty much the only  restaurant that cooks for  us at this time yeah  really really good is that  more steak for you Patrice  no no it's Iraq you don't  want that in a martini glass  there Iraq Iraq ate steak  and mashed potatoes out of a  martini glass yeah so that's  gonna make you have a nice  healthy nagel later on today  no kidding this white trash I  am a piece of garbage I'm  exhausted so Patrice love the  last to come over why don't 
[01:29:30]  you just throw it on the floor  why what's wrong with Iraq  enjoying some steak because  Iraq could eat at like the  worst chain restaurant and  enjoy it just as much as that  wonderful steak and doesn't  know the difference right  yeah it's like giving a dog  that steak we had a nice  conversation real quick about  a cuts of beef oh yeah  during commercials but  Patrice is like what is that  a hanger hanger steak what do  you think about skirt how  should that be prepared so it's  best to get the maximum  tenderization of the and then 
[01:30:00]  Iraq's just like woof woof  snausages it's bacon that's  that's Iraq when you give him  a nice cut of steak oh boy  oh boy oh boy oh boy it's  bacon all right he doesn't  know he doesn't care very good  point very good point he's  enjoying that delicious hanger  steak yeah perfectly done as  perfect as much as he would do  ground beef yeah right  hamburger helper could be in  front of him you ever get a  nice bottle of wine in front of  you and you're drinking with  people that you know they  could be drinking box of wine 
[01:30:30]  they don't care oh yeah and  you're just sitting there like  yeah you're drinking a bottle  what is this because i'll tell  you i had a in my fridge this  box it's got the tap right on  it and you just go you want to  take the heavy wine bottle and  lay it over their head is this  from gallo yeah what is it because  gallo makes it that boone's farm  and it's one of the strawberry hill  is a good good wine one of these  bottles bottle of wine bottles of  wine that you've just been hundred  and fifty dollar bottle of 
[01:31:00]  shiraz just been holding on to you  know it was a special gift from  someone right special occasion you  break it out and they're just  they're just slamming it back like  yeah oh this is good but i've had  some better have i have the there's a  the gallon jug that gallo puts out  really so i guess you make a good  point with eric eating steak hey uh  we gotta we gotta go right to the  phones uh by the way a little update  here uh we're tracking down ozone to  make uh make make it known to the  world that he is not a woman hey did

[01:39:30]  little bastards on my show right we got  too many laughs out of them  maurie just found out that his wife  isn't hosting big brother  he just found out  where's the chicks i thought she was  hoarding them  so how are things uh going in the uh ron and  fez camp  oh fantastic i want to take you out for  dinner as soon as they put fez away  uh if i lock fez up we're going to go out  and do the town  well people were speculating just uh 
[01:40:00]  yesterday and the day before yesterday  that um opie and fez will be in the same  mental institution  oh is that because of well because of what  happened uh the other day with stupid  chauncey and everything  either that or you were going to kill  somebody and be in a prison for the  criminally insane  uh and you and fez would be in  straight jackets and then me and ronnie  would have to get together and do a show  uh you know that would be like a super  group getting a super group  super group like like what asia  yeah a little asia action on the radio 
[01:40:30]  now imagine how bad things are going  when me and anthony are the sane ones  yeah exactly yeah right i can't stop  buying guns i uh i'm actually holding  up i'm just really really pissed  really really pissed and the post uh  you know so far hasn't done the right  thing and retracted uh the the crap  they printed in page six two days ago  and uh one of our friends uh ran into  somebody that works very closely with  this radio show and he's in a complete  panic now he's trying to blame somebody 
[01:41:00]  else  yeah for good luck for what went down  earlier this week in uh in uh in the  paper everybody at this point knows  it's just not true and now now i got to  clear you know my girl's name still so  you know i'm meeting with people today  i'm gonna make sure we uh we we get  this taken care of so the beauty of  uh ronnie though enough about that we  can talk about that another day the  beauty how organized is opie on this  this is the most organized he's ever  been oh yeah oh yeah well this is this  is my but that you know someone pushed  my button finally my real button you 
[01:41:30]  know people uh talk about where's the  line where you know where where do you  finally say enough is enough and that  and and this is where it's where it is  you know you're asking where's the line  opie oh i know yeah where's the line  that was right talks to me in between  shows and he gives me that look like  look man you know you've learned your  lesson right i see the look ronnie i'm  i'm better now i'm better but uh i mean  using a real name in the paper and all  that crap and and chauncey hayden knows 
[01:42:00]  damn well it's it's a bunch of lies  it's this thing's gonna get really really  ugly in the coming weeks really ugly i  promise you that uh but ronnie yeah i  told you this the other day you are a  brilliant broadcaster and i'll tell you  why because fezzy's basically having a  uh a mental breakdown right in front of  your eyes and you continue just giving  them quality radio day after day after  day and i don't think we brought this on  the air but ronnie was in in the zone he  was like michael jordan shooting those 
[01:42:30]  threes with his eyes closed just rocking  and rolling the show was moving the  rhythm was perfect he had bop bop the  phones and his and his people coming  and going and all of a sudden he stops in  the middle of all this just great radio  and goes what's wrong buddy yeah you  just know and and and the problem was  fez was was crying in the middle of this  just amazing radio and ronnie doesn't  even miss a step you know what you can uh  you know when you can tell fezzy's ready  to lose it he'll just start saying yeah 
[01:43:00]  and agreeing with things but it'll be  like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's  one it's one of my favorite things  when i listen around and that it's  horrible no not that that really that's  kind of it's it's very uncomfortable and  we all we feel bad for what fezzy's  going through personally absolutely but  my favorite part about that yeah ronnie  you know goes into uh what's wrong  buddy yeah and then has to comfort his  show just kind of goes all right what's 
[01:43:30]  the matter pal yeah what's the matter  you know i just see it as like the latest  character that he's doing  is that how you deal with it  crazy man here how are you  hey let's bring crazy man on  you just have little music to play when he's  i'm just waiting for ron to go to fez you  do realize that we're in the middle of our  exclusive interview with obama this  couldn't wait yeah and then i'm like jeez i 
[01:44:00]  don't know where we go when we die fez that  is scary  everything he wants to know is unanswerable  yeah yeah i don't know fezzy he trying to  make it to the next break  he has thoughts he has thoughts of an  eight-year-old right like when did that  happen like when you first realize you're  gonna die and it's around eight nine it  really freaks out a little bit but it's  happened to fezzy and i safe to say he's 
[01:44:30]  uh a bit older than eight probably four  to forty flurf he's forty flurf himself  but i just i'd just rather it happens on  the air than like three o'clock in the  morning like it does the rest of the time  oh jesus what do you get the phone call  yeah ronnie it's what i call fear comes  to roosevelt island  yeah he lived maybe he should live on a  less depressing island or places that  island is it stinks right  roosevelt island 
[01:45:00]  you know that used to be a mental institution  yeah he must just feel compelled to go  there like a a salmon going upstream  he just feels he should be in a a place  where lunatics used to be  that would be the saddest thing ever  it's not even his choice  hey ronnie this side of the show has no  idea um you did a whole interview with uh  mary lou henner and wasn't and wasn't  fez crying throughout the whole interview and  the whole interview was basically her talking  about his uh therapy and medications right and 
[01:45:30]  like he was just you know immediately she was  mary lou mommy to him you know you can't help me and i'm like not even paying attention  because this happens on a daily basis right he just wants to believe that the new person is going to be the one that helps right so like she says i'm like uh honey hang you ain't gonna see him again you know i gotta live with this you better you build them up like this nothing's gonna happen you're on taxis stop acting like you can help people  poor bastard man i don't know can you believe the gall of somebody who writes a self-help book though like i know so much now i'm gonna help the whole world with their problems

Of course, another forced L.A. celebrity ever for him.  Just forcing them to get up and call.  You think Borey wants to call us?  Trying to clear that morning gunk out of his throat. 
[01:54:00]  Happy birthday, Anthony.  I'm going to be at the Pagana.  You know his wife, I didn't say that to him, but Connie Chung is the reason I don't do web junk anymore.  Really?  Yeah.  Remember when she got fired?  Oh, and she was singing?  And she was doing all this crazy stuff.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And they just wouldn't let me say this line.  And I go, well, Connie, good night and good ruck.  Oh, wow.  And they're like, you can't do that.  I go, that's just too hilarious.  I said, it's time to go. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  That was the reason?  That is the reason.  No good night and good ruck.  The show's not even on anymore, right?  Web junk?  Yeah, it had to go.  I don't think it had to go.  You were great at it.  No, I mean, it had to go.  You had to leave.  Yeah.  It's too bad because they would have had a bunch of years with you in that show if they  just gave you some freedom.  I don't get it.  Just give someone like Patrice Freedom to do web junk and you'll have huge ratings.  Deal with the people that are complaining and tell them to shut up and continue doing web junk. 
[01:55:00]  Real quickly.  Yeah.  It's because the show, the key to the show was that I didn't like the internet.  Not that I enjoyed it.  Right.  I had to change it into somebody.  They wanted to change it into somebody that was like, and then this next guy, he's going  to drink milk and then throw up.  It's going to be great.  But I used to call him stupid.  Yeah, you goof on.  Look at that stupid.  And it was like, no, we have to be in conjunction because YouTube, the boop, the boop, the boop.  No.  You had a perfect take on it.  Why is there a gay giant Masalino walking around? 
[01:55:30]  Why is Don Morocco?  You don't see him right here.  Look at the big, look at the big, right there.  That's Nick Carter?  Who?  This guy.  What shirt?  The red shirt.  That's Nick Carter.  You're calling him like, what do you call him?  I said he's a big, a big gay version of Masalino.  Wow.  Damn.  I thought we were here. 
[01:56:00]  We are.  We're the only two black people he knows.  Black people.  Where is all this black on black crime in the studio?  That's not a perm in your hair.  That's natural white people hair right there.  Oh, damn, Nick.  At the most, I'll give you a cab driver or a friend of dad.  Oh, God.  That's just what I got there.  What?  He's the worst.  I'm just messing around.  Can you call Morocco?  Don Morocco.  Thank you, sir.  I got it early.  Thank you, Nick. 
[01:56:30]  What an old school reference that is.  Magnificent, Don Morocco.  Even his black friends are racist.  Oh, bravo to Nick Carter.  Oh, damn.  That was good.  That is line of the day right there.  Even his black friends are racist.  Even Anthony's black friends are racist.  That's brilliant.  Opie and Anthony, we'll continue.  Hi, this is Pat Cooper.  Do me a favor.  April 26th.  Can you come to the Count Basie Theater?  I'm appearing there in person with Gumbara Johnny.  That's in Red Bank, New Jersey.  And by the way, if you can't make that date, how about May 9th? 
[01:57:00]  Go to the Norfolk Theater at Westbury.  I'm there with Johnny Russo.  Why?  I don't know.  But somebody has to be there with Johnny Russo.  If any way you, you know I'll still be waiting.  All things she says, she says.  Joe.  Got some of the salespeople from this fine radio station in New York City  enjoying some of the food from Basil Tees from Tom's River.  The food was good, huh? 
[01:57:30]  Great.  Robin Roberts is looking delicious for some reason.  She just took the wig off.  Oh, my God.  I saw her in a smoothie place recently.  Goodness.  Are you saying cancer did her good?  Cancer do is making.  I don't know what's going on.  It's like you're digging her since she was sick.  She looks delicious, man.  Look at her all tall.  And she looks like Sherry Belafonte, man.  She looks tremendous.  Woo!  I want to thank Stephen Farley for, like, cooking up the food today. 
[01:58:00]  Thanks, Stephen.  Once again, great job.  Oh, I thought his name was Basil.  Ah, Basil Tees is the restaurant.  That's the name of the pan restaurant.  I'm sorry.  No one's named Basil.  I thought his name was Basil the Chef.  I'm sitting there calling you Basil every time you cook something.  Let me get an omelet, Basil.  Good looking out, buddy.  Ladies and gentlemen, the other half of Ron and Fez, it's Fez on the opening show.  Fez, hey!  Happy birthday to you.  Oh.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, Mr. Gun-Totty Nazi lover. 
[01:58:30]  Happy birthday to you.  Oh, thank you so much.  Happy birthday, Ant.  Thank you, Fez Marie.  I, uh, yeah.  We're sitting here celebrating.  What a great day.  It's been a great day?  I feel so.  Yeah, you know.  We'll see when the verdict comes out.  Well, that, that too.  If it's a good birthday or bad birthday.  When is the verdict coming out?  Nine?  Yeah, I believe it's supposed to be soon.  Could you imagine if on my birthday we got a race war? 
[01:59:00]  How ironic would that be?  That would be.  It does work when you blow out the candles and make it work.  Fez, my God.  Oh, could you just imagine?  You should save some of this for Ronnie B.  He could use the help there, Fez.  Yeah, totally.  You know, every now and then I just get, I get a weird feeling people are talking about me.  Oh, really?  A little ringing in your ears?  The whispering's getting a little louder around you, huh? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, Fezzy.  You doing all right, Fez?  Doing okay.  Doing all right today.  That's good.  Good to hear.  Well, that could change at a moment's notice, though.  Fez, you break...  Yeah, yeah, it could.  Oh, no, no.  Fez, you break my girl's heart, man.  I think she's more of a fan of Ron and Fez than our show.  That's what he does.  I come home and Ron and Fez are just cranking.  And when you break down live on the show, you know...  He gets women swooning like old Sinatra.  Oh, my God.  My girl feels so bad for you. 
[02:00:00]  I think she sent you a blanket or something.  I just want to acknowledge I had nothing to do with that.  Oh.  Oh, a little friend checking in?  What's going on?  Yeah.  Fezzy, what are you...  Are you trading GIFs?  Remember those days, AOL?  Ooh, come on, quick.  Scroll down.  I want to see if this is a good one.  Who's got JPEGs?  Who's got JPEGs?  JPEGs, JPEGs.  Yeah, I'm getting some instant messages here.  Really?  Oh.  Yeah.  I think everyone should...  I am Fezzy that's online.  Right now.  Right now, as he does his interview for Anthony's birthday. 
[02:00:30]  There you go.  Fezzy, you on the computer all the time?  Not all the time.  No?  No, it's not all the time.  Why don't you ever come on PalTalk?  Inconvenient times, when I'm on the phone, I guess.  What site are you on right now?  Let's see.  Meet Spin?  Right now, I'm on Movies.com.  Yeah, see.  The answer took way too long.  What site are you really on, Fez?  That was a little test from your pal.  That's at BoyMovies.com. 
[02:01:00]  BoyMovies, yeah.  Fez, did you ever get that blanket?  My girl keeps asking me to ask you.  Were you the one that put the blanket?  You don't even know that she sent you a blanket to make you feel better?  I got a blanket.  It's a beautiful cashmere blanket.  It's the softest thing I've ever touched.  Yeah.  And I had no clue who sent it to me.  Plus, you know, a breast isn't in that list.  Why?  You just don't acknowledge girl names?  It was from technically us, but it was my girl. 
[02:01:30]  She went out of her way to try to make you feel better, Fezzy.  It was very nice, but there was nothing that said who it was from.  Well, some people are saying he got spooked from it because he thought it was just a panel from the AIDS quilt.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Hey, come on.  People on PalTalk are ruthless.  You should go on PalTalk there, Fezzy.  Oh, yeah, maybe I should.  Like from your house.  Why don't you put a camera there? 
[02:02:00]  It's like having friends over.  And then people can see the crying up close.  Oh, God.  When was the last time you cried, Fez?  This morning.  Oh, I think it was probably yesterday.  Was it on the show?  No, it wasn't on the show.  And why were you crying yesterday?  I don't know.  Sometimes it just hits me.  You know what I like when...  I'm getting a lot of instant messages here.  Oh, good.  A lot of, let's see, cock head, pussy lips.  Oh, wait, I can't say that.  Well, I think you forgot where you were for a second there, Fez. 
[02:02:30]  Yes, what's up with that?  I forgot where I was.  You're a potty mouth.  You know, that Ronnie gives you good advice sometimes when he tells you this is your movie.  He goes, your life is your movie and you're the director, the actor, everything.  Yeah, it's a disaster film.  I always wonder why you have such a tough time, you know, getting that through your head.  Yeah.  Hey, speaking of movies, Fezzy, how jealous are you of Wesley Snipes? 
[02:03:00]  Oh, getting to go to prison?  Yeah.  For three years.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The cabbie story.  Yeah.  All right there, Fezzy.  All right, well, you have a happy birthday.  Thank you, sir.  Do you want to maybe plug anything?  Ron and Fez noon to three?  There you go.  Thank you.  But see, you had to be reminded.  I know.  That doesn't count now. 
[02:03:30]  I know when I'm on.  I'm not that crazy.  All right, Fezzy.  Thanks for checking in for Anthony's birthday.  All right.  No problem.  Have a happy.  All right.  Thank you, Fezzy.  Bye-bye.  Anthony has godfather respect, dude.  Yeah, it's nice.  That's so nice.  It's bigger than friendship.  Nice.  Because people are calling and going.  You can tell it's just a respect thing.  That's great.  Because people, they call and go.  They do like a little happy birthday thing.  It's like, happy birthday.  He did happy birthday.  Yeah.  And then right after the happy birthday thing, then it's, yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I am wit.  Wow.  Oh, well, look at the cake.  The cake has arrived.  That's cool, man.  It's shaped like an assault rifle.  Hold on.  There's a lot of cakes coming in.  Hold on.  And you got Lisa with a microphone.  And beer and, uh-oh.  Wait, who are you?  I just stopped by.  Well, who are you?  Who are you?  She's somebody from Petticoat Junction.  Watch out.  She's Jesus Christ.  Ixnay.  I need a plastic bowl.  She's the Enrol J. Aniger May. 
[02:04:30]  That's why that was a funny line.  It's like, who are you?  She runs the joints.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  Hopper Valley PTA.  Jesus.  Hey, Patrice.  Go all out, because we can't get in trouble.  You're not an employee.  I don't work here.  I don't work here either.  She is.  I don't work here either.  Maura, that's Patrice O'Neal, of course.  I don't think you guys have ever met.  Good to see you.  Anthony, we'd like to sing happy birthday to you. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, okay.  Marilyn Monroe would like to sing.  Oh, okay.  Are you ready?  Are you ready, Ant?  Wow, there's a lot of cakes.  Happy birthday.  Oh, here she goes.  To you.  Happy birthday.  Shut up, Bopey.  To you.  Ah!  Happy birthday, Mr. Anthony.  One flag.  Happy birthday.  Four ring.  To you.  Two flags.  Oh, you only got two flags. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  Two flags on the funnel meter.  Thank you so much.  And, of course, Bud Light's being passed out.  This assault rifle cake is unbelievable, man.  I know.  It's a little assault rifle cake.  Who was the one that just gave Anthony the Bud Light?  You are so fired.  That's good.  You are so fired.  You know who has to deal with this crap in the end.  Rest of the show, over.  You are so fired, my friend.  Over.  Are they cold?  Holy.  Yeah, it's cold. 
[02:06:00]  Maura, do something.  You're in charge.  I never drink before nine, though.  Huh?  I can't hear.  I'm not crazy.  How long have you been doing radio?  Talk it to a mic.  I'm the worst.  That's why I sell.  Yeah.  Aw.  What were you going to say?  I went into the deli.  I ordered a coffee, milk and sugar.  Nice.  And a six-pack of Bud Light for Anthony.  And they said, really?  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  And, Maura, how bad do you want one right now?  Let's be honest.  I was going to say, why are there only four in the bucket?  I was going to crack him on with somebody's head.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah, exactly.  There's a few people. 
[02:06:30]  And did we describe the cake there, Anthony?  The assault rifle looks like?  Yeah, with little tanks rolling around on it and little general stars.  Yeah, we got the picture up on onaradio.com.  People seem to think I'm a gun nut.  Yeah.  Maura, are we doing all right for you?  You're the boss.  No one has heard from the boss on this show.  I heard some ratings came in and we're doing all right for you, right?  We're doing really good.  All right.  The threes, one from the ones, the twos, the threes.  There ain't no stopping us now.  All right, good.  She's a power broker.  You can tell.  Oh, yeah.  She played the game a long time.  Oh, yeah.  She looks like she could play golf, right? 
[02:07:00]  She looks like she's probably, I think she slept with one black man at Woodstock.  Oh, wow.  Really?  She gave it a shot at Woodstock once.  Why won?  Why won, she said.  And then she just got corporate.  She's super corporate.  Yeah, true.  Oh, she's got corporate all over me.  But I'll tell you, the little I know, she's got an edge to her.  Of course she does.  She can hang with the boys.  I know she does.  That's why she'd never go anywhere.  She leaves here, she'll have another high power guy. 
[02:07:30]  Didn't you break a rib or something?  We haven't seen you in a while.  What happened?  Humble.  Humble.  He broke it?  Times Square.  What?  Flying Elvis.  Flying Elvis?  What did you trip over?  Stopped short, like you walk in one way, and they stopped, so they went to go left.  They stopped, they went right.  First of all, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So you broke your rib?  Just bruised.  Bruised?  Did you trip over Tom Chiosana?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ooh.  I'm too bad for that.  Tom listens every day. 
[02:08:00]  I kid because I love my friend.  And oh.  Yes.  What happened?  Look at the faces on phony corporate boys where they just keep that smile plastered, like.  I give a damn about her ribs, and he's just like.  I tend to.  Deep down, they're like, good, good.  She deserves that.  Oh, yeah.  Good God.  Well, it's good to meet you.  My pleasure.  Yeah.  Looking forward to it.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's potential here.  All right.  Okay, good.  Bye.  Better to look at than Tom. 
[02:08:30]  Smells much nicer, too, right?  Yeah, nice lady.  All right.  Nice lady.  Still holding her rib, though.  She's like, ah, I got a rib injury.  She's big time when it comes to this radio thing, but she's not really used to, like,  working in this type of environment.  True.  What?  CBS?  A little CBS FM, right?  Oh, yeah.  You gotta love them.  See?  You gotta love them.  She's like.  Very corporate.  I grew up with Harry Harrison, unwrapping each day like a precious gift.  And now I have O and A. 
[02:09:00]  And now you got this mess.  Rob Lundy, CBS FM.  Hello, love.  Right, that's all she had to deal with.  Give me a hug.  He was a great guy.  All she had to worry about was to make sure the echo level was just right.  That's all.  It's like she'd sit in the office and go, there's a little too much echo today, or a little too  little.  Yeah, turn down the echo on Harry Harrison.  Turn it up a little bit.  That was it.  It was really wonderful.  And now it's like, oh, God, who's complaining today?  It's true.  There's a lot of complaining going on.  Really?  Look at her.  And it's mostly coming from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  I don't mean listeners of it.  I mean the show itself.  Yeah.  She probably knows how to fire somebody really good for you.  Oh, yeah.  Doesn't she look like the...  Yeah, don't let that look for you.  Gives him a hug, gives him a kiss.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Hey.  Have a drink.  She's not working out.  She even does the dress down Friday.  What are we going to do?  Perfect corporate stuff.  Trying to relate to the scumbags that work with her.  Low lives.  Dude, you can put the cake on the chair or something like that. 
[02:10:00]  He's holding up.  Pass it around.  Let everybody take a look.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  They were just waiting for us to say they can leave.  It's a release.  Oh, my goodness.  They're just all standing there awkwardly.  You can hear all the air come out of the lungs.  In their ties, right?  Oh, thank God.  Because Maura goes, you better get in there.  They're here for the free food. 
[02:10:30]  And basil teas.  That's what they're here for.  Yeah, they're not stupid.  This is good stuff.  I'll tell you one thing.  I don't know half those guys that just came in.  Who are they?  I have one on the walkover.  Salespeople, at least.  Yes.  New guys?  Ha-ha.  Look at this.  New fish.  Fresh meat.  These two ex-racists.  Hey, ex-racists.  Trying to be corporate scumbags with their greasy taco.  Hooligan hair.  They're pissed off they had to grow their hair in.  They're like, oh, man.  Soccer hooligan hair. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, God.  With their team club name tattooed on the back of their hair, but they had to grow out.  They didn't even come in for the interview until they knew their tattoos were covered by their hair.  Look at these two scumbags.  They're from South Boston.  D-Street Projects.  Nothing but oi music on their iPods.  You're just not tricking anybody, you pieces of garbage.  Look at you.  Got the Doc Martens in the closet that they had to take off and put their corporate shoes on. 
[02:11:30]  How can you stomp ethnics with those dress shoes?  With those fake veneers trying to cover up the ten cracked tooth from the last fight they had with the Crips.  From a soccer game that went horribly wrong.  Goddamn.  They probably both got mini baseball bats right and tied that in the back of their pants pocket.  You can pull it out and conk somebody a few times.  Wrap them eight times in quick succession. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, corporate life.  I'm thinking a cell phone and brass knuckles in their front pocket.  That's it.  That's all they got going.  Yeah, they pull out brass knuckles and answer it by accident.  Oh, damn.  And he's not denying it.  He's just standing there.  He's going over his head.  Okay, don't punch him.  Don't punch him.  I was from Buffalo, though, so it's like the opposite of that.  God bless you, man.  What was that?  And sorry.  Are you telling me I can't do that voice?  That's not white guy voice?  What voice?  That voice he just had.  Well, talk, sir.  How are you? 
[02:12:30]  How are you?  How are you?  That is Patrice's white voice that he does.  Do you want to offend anybody?  He is overweight and he's black, but I can't get into that at all.  Nick Carter coming back in.  Don't put me in.  Look at Nicky.  I'm deleting you from my MySpace.  All right.  Oh, damn.  All right, Mosey Tattoo.  That'll leave seven friends.  Nick hasn't even started work yet and he's exhausted. 
[02:13:00]  What do you do to him, Patrice?  He's exhausted, really.  I'm sorry, man.  Why am I messing with everybody?  Look, I just never seen these people before.  Nick's always trying to keep the faith and, you know, brothers like you just crapping  on him.  I know.  Like, I work here.  I'm niggling on him.  I'm catching up crap outside of the building.  Yeah.  Dude.  Oh, see, here we go.  Oh, what, Patrice?  We got to go, but what are you doing?  All right.  You look just too much like High Chief Pete in my view.  What is that one? 
[02:13:30]  I think you got me.  You stumped me.  That's the Rock's father.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  No, that's the Rock's grandfather.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  You went way back.  You went back two generations.  Old school.  That's old school wrestling.  I got the Morocco.  The Magnum's in Morocco.  I got that one, but.  I'm just joking, man.  You're a good looking guy.  All right.  Hey.  Can't we all just get along?  Yes, we can.  Yeah, really.  We'll find out in two minutes.  We'll see in three minutes.  Wow.  I'm going to be on the walkover?  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  Let's get over there before nine.  I should have brought all of them today.  A big verdict coming down today here in New York City. 
[02:14:00]  Hey.  Not enough holsters.  Anthony, before we leave, E-Rock doing that bacon thing.  Throw me one.  If things get rough, throw me one, please.  E-Rock doing the bacon thing.  I don't know if it's going to work.  Okay.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Where's the bacon?  I smell bacon, bacon, bacon.  It's got to be bacon.  Only one thing smells like bacon, and that's bacon.  Bacon, bacon, bacon there.  Please, please.  Give me what's in the bag.  Chewy, yummy, smoky, bacon.  There you go. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  It's bacon.  Oh, my God.  What a great way to head.  God damn, E-Rock.  What a great way to head.  Academy Award.  That was perfect.  You have no idea.  You just started a new bit, my friend.  That was perfect.  We don't know what, but something will come with that one.  You should do the gig.  You should get the gig.  Yeah.  If they bring that campaign back.  Wow.  Fantastic.  Stay, uh...  Wait, wait.  Let me grade that.  Damn it.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It doesn't work without the...  No, no.  Hold on. 
[02:15:00]  Now go.  Now go.  Six flags.  More flags.  More fun.  That's six flags on that one, E-Rock.  Wow.  E-Rock never gets six flags.  Patrice.  It wasn't acting.  Okay.  That's true.  Patrice, where are you off to?  Port Authority?  You're trying to pick up some new broads?  What are you doing?  You look like...  Where are you from?  Kansas, honey?  You need a meal?  Are you hungry?  We stand here?  No, we're leaving, but I...  Look at that.  On the walk?  He's got to look classy for the walkover. 
[02:15:30]  He's got a bit of a pimp look to him today.  I'm thinking he might...  He's got a fingernail polish on, too.  Yeah, I noticed your nails are really glossy.  Yeah, I got to make sure.  You're looking good.  You're glossing up the nails?  It's summertime, man.  Patrice is looking good.  All right.  Stay tuned.  Here in New York, it's Nick Carter.  Who's on next at the other stations?  I don't know.  I really don't.  We're going over to XM.  Have a good day.  XM 202. 
[02:16:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room, and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that.  Opie and Anthony.  Cat shovel baseball.  Baseball.  Oh, nice. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, oh, that was him.  Hey, hey.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst, the worst show I've, this is the worst show I've ever been on.  I don't know if it's still ever.  Let's get the show on the road.  Attention, white people.  Attention, white people. 
[02:17:30]  Leave New York City immediately.  White people.  Attention.  Attention.  Oh, I wish I had my bullhorn.  What's your thing?  We need your bullhorn.  Attention, white people.  Drop what you're doing and leave New York City immediately.  Run for your lives.  Run for your lives.  Every man for himself.  Run over women and children.  Please leave anywhere where you find a large majority of ethnic people.  Don't worry about your job.  Just leave.  Your boss will understand. 
[02:18:00]  Detectives found not guilty on all counts in bridegroom slaying.  Don't worry about your job.  You could get another one.  You're white.  It's not even a black.  Black is called black cops.  Oh, my God.  Please.  It doesn't matter.  A black cop is considered a white guy.  Plan everyone to evacuate.  This is going to be worse disaster than Cloverfield for New York.  Uh-oh. 
[02:18:30]  Take an eight-hour lunch break.  Uh-oh.  Oh, damn.  Wait a minute, though.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no, you didn't.  For the rest of America, CNN for your coverage.  But there's the president.  Did you see that guy on the right?  That was a bullshit.  I saw.  I can relapse.  The guy goes, that's bullshit.  I want to ask for calm and it's a time with the verdict.  I want to ask for calm.  And if it's black women, if there's a lot of black women out there, there's big trouble.  Because black women tell police officers the law. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, look at this guy.  You can't frisk me.  Look at this guy.  I know my rights.  Go to CNN.  That guy's saying this is bullshit.  Oh, this is bad.  Yeah, just like a bad call on the...  He's got his ass floor.  He's got his whitey tee on, too.  Oh, he's mad.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit, America.  All right, hold on.  Let's hear a little audio.  I'm sorry.  So, Betty, Don, this is...  I'm sorry.  Betty, Tony, this is really something here. 
[02:19:30]  We don't know how this is going to play out.  Remember Reverend Al Sharpton saying that everybody should stay calm, it should stay non-violent.  But, again, there's got to be disappointment on the court of Nicole Bell.  This will not be over, mind you.  Remember, federal authorities have said they will look and examine this case.  They will examine all the evidence.  They will see whether, in fact, civil rights violations...  What?  Get the fuck out of here.  Shut up.  You just said OJ, motherfucker. 
[02:20:00]  Fuck, because OJ killed us.  But he got away.  OJ wasn't Officer OJ.  What difference does that fucking make?  Fuck, and they're paid to uphold the law.  Jesus Christ.  OJ got off and he went to a civil trial.  We expect our next charges to come out.  Yeah, yeah, thank you.  Happy birthday.  You promised that you wouldn't go after Anthony today because it's his birthday.  I've got to understand how Patrice must feel sitting here.  This is probably like one white guy sitting in a room full of black people when Martin Luther King got shot.  It's just kind of like, uh, a little awkward. 
[02:20:30]  There's a Puerto Rican here that will side with me.  Half a Mexican.  There's another minority in here that will be on my side.  That's right.  We got Louis C.K. in studio today looking just a bit creepy because we're not used to seeing him without facial hair.  No, it's weird.  I don't think he looks creepy.  I'm not saying it looks bad or anything.  It's just different.  I think he looks fresh-faced is what Dan said.  I'm still not used to it.  It's kind of gross.  Really?  I feel like I look like a slug.  Who's this cute little heroin addict that just came in here?  She looks delicious. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  She looks like she stars in red light porn, baby.  The real porno.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Ixnay on the girl A.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Ah, that could be, you know.  Somebody's...  Could be someone I'm fucking.  Is it?  Could be.  I apologize.  That's okay, Patrice.  She might be your girlfriend one day and then I got to retract, but...  Well, Patrice, you know how it is.  I say that with all due respect. 
[02:21:30]  Why would you not look around and see a little white girl and think I don't have something  to do with it?  I see little white guys.  You ain't got nothing to do with it.  Somebody always just finds themselves in here.  You've always bashed me about my little white girl fucking thing.  Yeah.  Wow.  She looks like one of them suicide girls.  You ever see that?  Yeah, I like that shit.  Oh, my goodness.  Dot com.  With no tattoos, which makes her quite attractive.  Yeah.  Is this your girlfriend?  I don't like that.  This is my girl.  This is a friend girl.  So, she's not off limits. 
[02:22:00]  This is don't ask a bunch of questions.  She's not off limits yet.  And you should be happy that I think she's quite lovely.  Thank you, Patrice.  And happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you for me.  Hey, so let's go back to the CNN.  Prior to the meeting.  Wait a minute.  That don't be uncomfortable.  That ain't right.  That's a joke, Patrice.  That's not uncomfortable at all.  That was a joke.  That ain't right.  I think she's gorgeous, man.  Thank you, Patrice.  Is she really your girlfriend?  Well, yeah.  She's a friend as a girl.  He already said what she was.  We're kind of, you know.  Fucking nice.  I thought I'd be able to just say. 
[02:22:30]  That's definitely inappropriate.  But it's not.  You want that.  Don't you?  What would you rather me say?  Well, you meet somebody who your friend is dating and you go, fucking nice.  What do you want me to say?  You could do better, Anthony?  She's sexy.  Nice to meet you, human being person.  What's your name, human being?  What's your name, human being?  Right.  Look it.  There's horniness in the hair.  You don't even know her name.  Huh?  You can't just bring.  You can't have this girl come and sit in here.  Yeah, but a fucking person doesn't.  In the beginning of summer. 
[02:23:00]  You know, it's springtime.  It's full springtime.  Yeah.  And she has a lace wife beater on with white pumps that kind of match the lace wife beater  with these little jeans.  Yeah.  She's so taboo to me.  Yeah.  I know, but still, you still control your fucking self because you're a grown up.  Why?  Because you're an adult.  I feel like being an uncomfortable Negro looking at this white woman.  I feel like making this a very uncomfortable.  Look at Billy.  I am with you.  He's going to make sure she's okay. 
[02:23:30]  Billy's got her back.  All right.  I'm going to just say nice.  Hello, young lady.  Hello, young lady.  Anthony's friend, should I call her?  Could I ask her name?  You can.  What's your name, young lady?  I don't know how much info should be given out right now.  That's the radio.  I'll call her Haley, which is a white girl's name.  Haley?  Haley?  What the fuck kind of name is Haley?  I just always wanted to fuck a Haley.  She's better than a Haley.  I don't know what.  Haley's an awful name.  It's as white of a name as I can think, just to say, just to keep her taboo. 
[02:24:00]  That's a black name, too.  Haley?  Haley what?  Johnson?  Haley?  Haley is in a bitch.  The fuck is Haley, too?  Haley Berry.  Haley is in a bitch.  Haley, you motherfucker.  And black people always spell it different than white people.  Oh, I know.  Because if it's Julie, white people spell it J-U-L-I, no, J-U-L-I-E, and black people  spell it J-E-W hyphen over the W.  Oh, there's a Q in there somewhere.  With a Q, with a Q.  I don't know what the fuck that is.  Yo, can we call you Mahalia?  Your name's Mahalia for the day. 
[02:24:30]  Well, nice to meet you.  And also, congratulations, Anthony.  Thank you, sir.  Fuck that.  That is fantastic.  There you go.  Yes.  Precisely.  It does lead us, it leads to a discussion we were having in the office this morning  there, Patrice.  You were talking about wanting to break up with your girl.  Yeah.  Just for the summer, though.  No, I was on the way to breaking up with her about a month ago.  Yeah.  It was on the way, dude.  Because she just, you know, she was just getting too familiar. 
[02:25:00]  Really?  Yeah.  So it's getting too familiar for you?  Yeah, just, yeah.  You know, I don't, I don't want her to ever discuss my, anything I say on the radio, or  she got mad at something I say on the radio.  And, uh...  That you wanted to dump her bitch ass?  Could that have been it?  Yeah.  Something?  No, but it's like, you know what?  What'd she get mad at when you said women are inferior?  No, she don't get mad at that.  She just, she gets mad at anything that has something to do with her.  And I said, one, I think it was Dr. Z. 
[02:25:30]  I think it was the last time I was on.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  No.  Dr. Z.  Dr. Z was a dildo up your ass.  And I said, Dr. Z probably, her pussy, she says, your pussy smells like what you eat.  And she said, I eat a lot of pineapple.  I said, oh.  And then I said, my girls must smell like mini burgers from Hula Hans.  Oh, right, okay.  So, she got mad at that.  But we, it really was an argument.  So I'm like, what the fuck?  Wait a minute, why did she get, she really actually got mad at that?  She got mad at that, man. 
[02:26:00]  Because what?  Don't, it's just because her own personal problem that I touched her thing.  Oh, so her pussy does smell really bad.  No, it doesn't smell bad.  But it's just like, you know that I've got a smelly pussy.  I don't want everybody to know about it.  When I'm doing radio, I don't, I don't want to discuss my mouth when I'm doing, I don't  want, I've seen girls, I just don't want her to be one of those girls that cause me problems.  You know, you see a guy that's miserable when he's eating or anything like that because  this girl's just making him miserable.  I just, don't make me miserable.  I'm doing my job.  I got, what am I going to say? 
[02:26:30]  Your pussy smells wonderful.  Like, I'm supposed to say your pussy smells like mini burgers.  That's just funny.  It's the show.  So I was really mad at her because she got mad.  I wanted to leave her, man.  And I just, and I realized I loved her that day because her eyes started welling up and  I go, fuck.  And I just told her, I wish, you know, I rather.  That doesn't mean you love her.  No, I don't.  It doesn't.  It does.  The words from a beaten man.  You know what it is?  I looked at her, I looked at her, I didn't want to.  I said, I said to her, you know, I'd rather you get hit by a truck than I hurt your fucking 
[02:27:00]  feelings.  I'd rather somebody tell you, I'd rather you die than I fucking actually, like, break  your heart, you motherfucker.  You lucky I love you.  Oh my God.  That's hilarious.  So what about, so maybe you take a break and you break up for the summer.  Dude.  I think it's a brilliant concept.  From here to the thing.  It's just from here.  Till September? 
[02:27:30]  No, from over to CBS to XM, that walk.  You broke up with her, got back together with her three times?  My dick hasn't moved outside of porn in a long time.  And it just, it's moving now.  Like, it's in the streets, just moving.  Oh, so you're kind of like looking around and do it again.  And then I'm looking.  It's springtime in New York City.  And it just immediately turns into fury at my bitch, you know what I mean?  But she, as I look at some delicious titties bouncing, and I just want to bite her. 
[02:28:00]  You know, that's why, that's why, you know, I'm trying to dress nice just so, you know,  I can be halfway attractive, just so I don't, I don't be, feel rapey.  That's it.  I don't want to feel rapey.  I don't want to feel like, oh, you cunt.  You know what?  I'm just going to fuck you right in the hallway at Dwayne Reed right now.  Yeah.  Where are they marching to?  Well, this is the beginning of what I see as a riot.  It starts off slow.  See, we're talking about the Sean Bell case.  The three NYPD officers found not guilty. 
[02:28:30]  MSNBC is showing a bunch of people just marching.  And it's like a slow walk at first.  Slow walk.  Where are they walking to?  Oh, God.  Not my white neighborhood.  Samuel Jackson's getting a little angry over there.  That guy's trying to start a riot, but nobody cares.  Well, he's talking to white people.  No, that's Wesley Snipes.  He's got a, no.  What?  No?  He's got like a Samuel Jackson look to him.  Any clue where they're walking to?  They're picking up people as they walk.  That can't be a good thing.  See, it starts off as, okay, the family's walking now, and they're going to talk to the 
[02:29:00]  press.  And then other people start gathering with the walk, and then people don't even know why  people are walking, but they start walking.  And then everyone gets a new TV.  It's a game of lemmings.  Yeah.  You ever play lemmings?  Like, I can handle three or four of these fuckers, but now it's like 50.  This could end up...  I don't think this is good.  When you are trying a case, as a defense attorney, of course, what you tell your witnesses always  is, tell the truth.  Tell the truth.  Be as honest as possible.  All right, that's just crap.  Yeah, they're going through the trial and stuff, but this guy up top there is a little 
[02:29:30]  angry.  Yeah.  He's yelling, he's got some kind of a cami military cap on.  Yeah, we don't even listen to him, though.  No?  No.  No, he has no teeth on the right side of his mouth.  We don't listen to people with the...  And that's what white people think, we listen to motherfuckers with no teeth on the right  side of the mouth.  You motherfuckers, this is crazy.  It's upper right side.  Is that a different group?  Because there's a couple of groups.  It's like, you ever see Mercury?  Sure.  And it's all little bits of Mercury all gathered together. 
[02:30:00]  In the end, it all comes together.  Like the Terminator.  And you can put it together.  Yeah, like the Terminator.  Like the T-2000.  I'm sorry, what's the reference?  Look at this old lady.  Well, it's just like little groups here and there, but then they'll all just slowly gel  together.  He's just into some nigga jelly.  Into a killer Terminator.  He's into some angry nigga jelly.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  It is.  Hold on.  You just fucking say what you want to say.  You just turn it to T-2.  Dude, this situation's definitely getting worse.  There's an old lady with a walker that just joined the march in the upper right-hand  corner of that lady in white.  See, that's how afraid Anthony is. 
[02:30:30]  That's how afraid Anthony is.  Yeah.  Of black people.  Because he just sees them clumping together.  I just see one entity.  He just sees black, that color.  It's just one entity.  Yeah, we don't like that.  That will come together into a giant scale.  Why is there a Sharpie pin walking down the street?  Oh boy, they're walking again.  They start walking again.  And there's a little more like-  MSNBC doesn't think it's important enough.  They're doing a skin commercial right now.  Yeah, this doesn't- this is not- black people don't riot in New York. 
[02:31:00]  Not in New York.  You're right.  No, they don't.  Because you know why?  The cops are real fucking tough on that shit.  No.  Yeah.  Because cops here- you know what?  New York cops aren't- L.A. cops are horrific.  Oh, I understand.  And because-  But L.A. black people can be really- you got bloods and crips, like real life bloods and  crips.  But no, you know what it is?  It's because fucking L.A. has mansions right next to the projects. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  So those cops are making sure niggas ain't spilling in to- like Beverly Hills is right  next to goddamn-  Yeah, Compton.  Well, not Compton, but Inglewood.  Yeah.  And- but here, it's- everything's defined.  So they're not worried about motherfuckers coming.  Black people ain't crazy enough to come to Manhattan and stop breaking up shit.  What are we gonna do, break up the M&M store or the fucking-  Get the M&M's, motherfucker, and them- you know them goddamn- them Indian shop owners.  They'll shoot them, motherfucker. 
[02:32:00]  TGI Fridays.  They're rioting in TGI Fridays.  Yeah.  But what about like Brooklyn and Queens?  They're not rioting, dude.  You get some of those neighborhoods.  Nah, cause dudes-  What happened with the- remember what happened with the Yankil Rosenbaum years ago?  And-  That was barely-  Crown Heights and-  It was barely anything.  I didn't- I lived here then.  I didn't even notice it.  I will tell you what the difference is.  I read it on the news like it was another country.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, but the difference was you had a different mayor at the time.  What?  The mayor made a big difference.  And I think Giuliani's effect is still- 
[02:32:30]  Who is the mayor of Los Angeles doing Rodney King?  Oh, black guy.  Who even fucking- who even cares about that fact?  It doesn't matter, but it's-  I'm sorry, happy birthday.  I think they have-  I'm sorry about that.  He's giving me a pass on my birthday to be racist.  I'm sorry.  Which is nice.  And I appreciate it.  It's probably the best gift I've gotten.  What was your point?  What was your point, Mr. Kumi?  I'm so sorry about that.  What was you saying?  I'm just saying, when Dinkins was in office here, there was a lot of criminal activity  that was allowed to go on in this city.  And then Giuliani got in and really got the police involved and said, we're not taking 
[02:33:00]  any more bullshit.  And there won't be any rioting.  And if there's a blackout, there's not going to be fucking looting and shit like that.  And some heads had to be cracked in, but it worked.  And that's carried over right now.  With all due respect, Mr. Kumi.  The law here in New York, the law, we know-  You're only counting-  Yes.  This borough.  Manhattan.  Yes.  Talk about Manhattan.  I don't remember there being a lot of crime in Manhattan.  You don't remember?  Well, you don't remember.  I don't either. 
[02:33:30]  But I hear tell.  In the 70s, it was bad.  Yeah, the 70s was awful.  That's why they made that movie, The Warriors.  We got a guy that used to work around that time.  Billy, thumbs up on that bed?  Hold on.  Let me get you on there.  Anthony, right?  Yeah.  But in the 70s, you know, there was serious crime and there was a lot of lawlessness going  around and, you know, you really weren't- your hands were kind of tied.  Billy, can I please ask you a question?  Let's stop this fiasco.  Just tell us how you flooded the black community with crack. 
[02:34:00]  Which is interesting.  Patrice called Billy Mac his worst nightmare earlier.  We gave it away with the grape soda.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no, we didn't.  And that is, I will say, that is-  Put it in the phantom.  That is our- the dismissive paranoia that you people do to us, which is we know that  you put sterilizations, sterilizing agents in the great punch, in the great punch. 
[02:34:30]  We didn't think of what would happen if we didn't.  Mr. Billy, thank you for being honest.  You put steril- you put that- we all know you invented AIDS.  Yeah.  Sure.  I'll fess up to that.  Thank you very much.  I know that.  The Illuminati.  The Illuminati.  And you said, looks- the head of the Illuminati, Patrice, that he looks like the Quaker Oats  guy.  It's just this vast white conspiracy that's based on symbols and stuff, you know, like  the Masons and the pyramid and the eyeball on the back of the dollars and the pentagram 
[02:35:00]  and pentagon.  I don't want to believe it.  I don't want to believe it, but you- look, there's a YouTube thing called- just look  at the- the symbols.  You look at the dollar.  Let's- let's take the fucking dollar and the fact that after 9-11, you can fold it up  and you can see the Twin Towers burning.  Now-  Right.  Why?  I could also fold up Washington's head and make it look like a mushroom.  But wait a minute.  Why the fuck?  Mushroom's good. 
[02:35:30]  When you fold up a dollar, does it look like the world's tracing a burning?  And then-  Because you're crazy and you have problems in your brain.  But-  Because your brain doesn't work properly.  And then who the fuck do things?  Because you're putting all your energy in the wrong places.  It's not right.  Which is what black people do.  This is- this is what- this is what bothers me about some-  Of course it does.  About some of you.  Because a lot of you is Latino.  Look how much more people.  Yeah.  The crowd's growing a little bit.  Let's-  Oh, look at you fuckers, man.  That's growing a bit.  Bunker down.  This is my paranoia with the goddamn folded dollar. 
[02:36:00]  I know.  Dismiss it.  I know.  But old crazy niggas that can't control their self.  Yeah.  Just-  Because it's never happened that a verdict came in and acquitted police officers and there  was a riot.  It's never happened before.  How about because of Rodney fucking King?  Yeah.  You just-  Yeah.  The motherfucking criminal gets his ass beat.  He's alive, but he gets his ass beat from running from the cops and they get acquitted.  I'll be quite honest.  I don't think that there's- unless there's 41 people coming at you- 
[02:36:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That you should fire 41 times.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  One cop isn't firing 41 times.  First of all, a moving car is not a goddamn weapon that you fear that much.  It certainly is.  It's a deadly weapon.  Coming at you from two feet away?  It's considered a deadly weapon and you are allowed to use deadly physical force.  It can only go straight back and forth.  What is it, a train?  It's not a bull.  It doesn't have a thought process and it doesn't have feet. 
[02:37:00]  It can only go straight back and forth.  It can only go where you turn it.  No one's ever been hit by a car.  Dude.  No one's ever been dragged by a car.  You can try your white tricks if you want.  Happy birthday, boy.  I'm trying my-  I knew this wasn't going to work.  It's not going to work!  These are not the officers you're looking for.  I'm trying to work my Jedi mind shit on them.  There's the- there's the- there's the culprit right there for you guys.  The fear you have.  The fear you have.  Obama.  Obama.  Wait a minute.  Is there a hot seat in the front row of that crowd, though?  Doesn't it look like- 
[02:37:30]  Wow.  Yeah, it does.  There's a hot seat.  Oh, no, no.  I think I see a lot of dreadlocks.  With one of those big cake hats that they wear sometimes.  What are white people doing in that crowd?  They're crazy.  No, it's great.  CNN is-  Because they think of it just like skydiving.  It's a thrill seeker.  You see how CNN is moving the camera?  They're just hoping that something is happening.  They're looking around going, where's the riot?  Yeah, they're creating their own movement.  Oh, he's right now.  The thing that's gathering the attention is the helicopter over them.  Yeah, you know, you're-  It's not the people.  You're right.  Patrice, I'll give you that.  Because Opie's absolutely right. 
[02:38:00]  The media wants something to happen.  They want this so bad.  And they have cameras around, and they're going to-  I wouldn't be surprised they start throwing flyers out of the news helicopters with just  the N-word written on it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, coon.  Anderson Cooper.  Anderson Cooper going to go out there and go, y'all going to let them do this shit?  That's what's going on.  Y'all some punk-ass Negroes.  Damn.  They're sending out CNN interns.  They're shaving their heads right now and putting Doc Martens on them.  To just send them out and chant anti-black rhetoric.  Oh, Jesus, man. 
[02:38:30]  Why won't you just stop?  This is-  I mean, is it some-  There's nothing wrong about that at some point?  You know, the amount of times that you shoot?  The amount of times?  Well, now, I was saying that.  If you got four cops, and they each shoot in ten rounds,  you're going to empty your magazine out.  If you still think you're being shot at, you're going to keep shooting.  That's what these cops did.  So it adds up to 40, but it's four guys with ten rounds.  They're trained not to do that, man.  You're going to go, pop, pop, pop.  Let me assess the situation.  Wait, wait.  Billy, Billy, aren't you trained? 
[02:39:00]  Aren't you trained?  Cops are trained.  I know his answer.  I'm confident.  To not unload?  No, keep shooting until your threat assessment is eliminated,  and you're no longer in-  You need protection.  There you go.  If you're still hearing gunfire-  I see fucking white videos of white women and white dudes  smacking cops in the face.  State troopers.  Those are staged to anger black people.  We stage them.  It's part of the vast conspiracy.  And I can't believe in Illuminati and the breakthroughs. 
[02:39:30]  I've seen the outtakes.  They're hysterical.  It's like watching old cannonball run footage.  The Illuminati.  Come on, man.  That takes too much work to get the dollar bill just right.  If we're going to rig 9-11, why would-  Oh, you have to use that language.  Oh, rig.  That's hard.  Why would we go all the way back to the dollar design and go-  Yeah, that's a lot of-  We got this dollar organization.  Okay, listen.  That's a lot of patience, too.  Why the fuck?  And why wouldn't they have done it a lot earlier? 
[02:40:00]  Because it's like, look, we got the dollar bill set.  Let's do this immediately.  Why is-  I knew it.  Copies on the fucking dollar bill.  Now I got to pull out a button.  A black guy trying to read Latin is about as sad as any of her.  Get your dollar bill out, you fucking fix.  Shit, I only got hundreds.  Damn.  And no surprise, I have no money.  So I'm kidding.  All right, let me see.  Oh, here's a dollar.  Just what the fuck is this shit on it?  Where is the towers on fire thing?  Come on.  How do you do the towers on fire thing?  It's some kind of-  I don't know how to do it. 
[02:40:30]  Damn it.  It's like origami you got to do.  You got to do it really?  What?  The mushroom?  It's a mad fold-in.  It's the front.  It's a mad fold-in.  Oh, yeah.  You do this.  Is it the front?  It's the front.  Oh, right, because his hair is smoke.  And then the-  No, no, no.  The frame around it.  It's trees.  Trees.  The frame around his head looks like a tower if you fold it right.  No, it's not.  I think his head is the smoke.  Oh, fuck, man.  You forgot how to do it.  You don't know how to do it.  Google.  Shit.  Oh, there it is.  Look, look, look. 
[02:41:00]  Right there.  Oh, yeah, you got to fold it in a triangle.  Cut the fuck on, man.  Dude, I'm going to get arthritis trying to-  It's a 20 for today.  It's a 20.  Oh, it's a 20.  Yeah, you idiot.  Shit, Patrice, go knock one of them over the head and grab one.  Oh, it's a 20.  Dude, look at that shit.  That's nothing?  That's too complicated.  That's nothing to you?  That's somebody thinking-  But why would we do that?  Because when we do that, what's to be gained?  Because, like, the honorable-  The fucking back of a 20 was designed, like, a million years ago.  Exactly. 
[02:41:30]  Why do that, Patrice?  Just to go, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Like the honorable Reverend Wright said.  You think we designed the 20 to make that picture, and then, like, a hundred years later,  somebody designed the Twin Towers to match it.  It's the Illuminati.  There it is.  It's burning.  Look at that.  There it is.  You just fucking take a look at that.  Two towers, one's taller than the other.  That doesn't-  That is fucking-  I know.  What kind of coincidence is that?  Let me see.  Let me see.  What the fuck?  What kind of coincidence is that?  Let me see.  I can't see.  No, I'm not going to hand this to you. 
[02:42:00]  That's just nothing?  I know you'll take it.  Get out of here, you bastard.  That's just nothing?  That's nothing?  I need to get money.  Anthony, that's nothing.  No, it's-  Let me look.  It's a coincidence.  It's, um-  The world is-  I'm trying to think of how someone might have come up with it.  Yeah, exactly.  But you're right.  Why?  That is quite the coincidence.  Like, who said, hey, you know, if you fold it-  And then why, right after 9-11, did that happen?  Why do I know how to do that right after 9-11?  Dude, if someone did it before, now that would be fucked up.  If somebody did it before, then that'll be better.  At least you go, oh-  Better?  Look at the towers burning. 
[02:42:30]  Dude.  Oh, and then it happens, and then you'd be like, who was that fucking guy?  They did this years before 9-11, and people went, ah, it looks like nothing.  Oh, well.  And then one day, people were like, holy shit, it looks like the tower's burning.  Listen, man.  I'm going to try to invent something.  I'm just going to take a 10, and I'm going to try to fold it up, and show black people  rioting.  Louie, Louie, Louie, I am begging to half of you.  Please.  Half of you.  I'm going to-  Just, I'm begging to you.  Patrice.  Shh.  All right. 
[02:43:00]  See, you've got to give white people more credit than that.  Okay, look, I want to show you the back of a 10 folded the same way.  It's the towers again.  No.  If you fold any fucking bill like this, the towers are going to be burning.  Okay, then that even makes it more scary.  I'm making a hairy pussy out of my dollar.  All right.  Just give me a few minutes here.  A hairy pussy.  I'm going with 70s Earth Mama Muff.  What happens to a hundred?  If you look at a 20, just look at a 20 for a second.  The front of it just unfolded.  Mm-hmm.  And look at Andrew Jackson and the collar of his jacket.  Oh, shit. 
[02:43:30]  It looks like two women's black legs, and he's like diving into-  And she's got little white panties.  Look at it.  Do you see it?  Oh, yeah.  I see it.  Wow.  And there's like two knees up in the air, and he's about to dip down and see the little  white panties right above the word Jackson.  You ever do the thing with the butter?  The girl with the butter?  The little Indian girl that's on her knees-  You can make a pussy.  With the butter?  No, you make tits.  I mean tits.  Tits, right?  Like she's holding the butter like this, but her kneecaps, because she's kneeling, you  could fold her kneecaps up to her chest.  Yeah, why would they do that, Patrice?  And as a kid, that was almost jerk-off material.  No, it's dismissive.  I'm not going to- 
[02:44:00]  This is dismissive.  I can't allow this.  Oh, you're-  You can't marginalize the Illuminati, man.  It's there.  There's no reason-  Where's the owl?  Let's fold 100 the same way and see what happens.  Huh?  Where's the owl, and what does that mean?  Where's the owl?  YouTube.  On what dollar bill?  What dollar bill is the owl on?  On the one?  I gotta find out if I'm looking at this.  There's supposedly something with the Illuminati about the owl.  A small owl somewhere.  Where?  I see the eye above the pyramid.  All right, you fold 100, you get nothing.  Huh?  You get like a fucking bad shave job on a pussy. 
[02:44:30]  It looks like-  Where's the owl?  Come on.  Come on.  Where is the owl?  Yeah, what's this with the owl?  Why does the owl mean so much to the Illuminati?  It's all evil shit, man.  Where is the owl?  Since when's the owl evil?  That little blob is an owl?  Oh, shit.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mars.  Of course Mars would know.  What's the matter?  Of course, because he's down, but he wants to keep his job.  It's a Mars.  Come on, Mars.  What is it, Mars?  You know about the Illuminati, don't you?  Sit down, Mars.  Fuck that shit.  All right, what's the Illuminati, Mars? 
[02:45:00]  Help us out.  Don't get nervous, man.  Fuck that.  I'll give you a job fixing my computer.  No, actually, I want to see a little crack happen in this window, and Mars just collapse  in his seat as blood comes from his head.  Why is that?  Why?  That's the devil pentagram, man.  So what does that mean?  That's fucking devil worship and fucking pagan shit.  The star has been a part of this country for many years, part of the flag, obviously, a  part of a lot of symbols.  A part of devil worship.  More devil worship.  And he's saying the pentagram is just huge. 
[02:45:30]  Look, it's pentagram.  But, but...  Pentagram.  Pentagon.  Motherfuckers.  Yeah, the number five is a little hard to avoid.  It's right between four and six.  It's a fucking pyramid.  Okay, here's the pyramid.  Well, look at this shit.  It's all symbols of the Illuminati.  Eyeball.  All right, on our fucking dollar bill.  Yes, because these are all shapes that are very useful in architecture.  You believe in the Illuminati, right?  These are all...  Moss, baby.  There's a reason why we keep people using thermals.  Moss believes it.  Moss believes it, too.  What is the Illuminati?  What are they?  It's the silent bunch of white guys, like masons and shit like that. 
[02:46:00]  They're not silent.  They're ruling everything openly.  Yeah, but they're ruling...  And are hurting black people for profit.  Every day.  Why are you looking for secrets?  There's no secret.  Just like people are kicking your ass with no...  Nicolas Cage's movie.  They made it to make fun of it.  Disney fun out of it.  Right.  But it's real shit.  It's evil shit.  Again, it's black people putting effort in the wrong area.  Look at...  Lucas is one.  I'm trying to uncover that.  So you think that the Founding Fathers set something up that has continued all throughout 
[02:46:30]  these years and gotten stronger.  It's not fucking torches.  They go to...  And it's based on white people staying in power?  Absolutely.  And they fucking...  They have...  You know...  Can I ask you something, though, here?  What do they say when they kill white girls?  Virgin white girls.  Jesus Christ.  Fun?  Fun.  All the way for somebody to...  I hope no one catches me.  How come the Founding Fathers...  How many want?  This was before the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, so there was still slavery. 
[02:47:00]  Black people weren't even...  It didn't even look like they were going to be in charge of anything.  Or even come close to being in charge.  So why would the Founding Fathers put in place something to keep the black man down when  they were already...  I don't think it's made to keep the black man down because it makes everyone suffer.  It's not just a black thing.  It's the master plan to make white people say certain things.  It's the quiet war.  That's what the pyramids are.  It's the masses.  It's the eyeball is over the masses.  The pinnacle...  Yeah, but where do you hide from everything, man? 
[02:47:30]  Why are you folding $20 bills when Bush and the Bin Laden family are business partners  and they fucking brought down the towers right in front of everybody.  And then...  I mean, there's no secret.  Are you trying to...  Are you trying to...  It's so silly.  There's a $20 bill.  Is this some kind of magic sarcasm?  I believe it, motherfucker.  You don't even need sarcasm.  I believe it.  It's like somebody walks up and punches you in the face and then you go fold the dollar 
[02:48:00]  and go, I think this guy's trying to get me with this dollar.  There's no white people here.  Not one motherfucker that believes that the towers might have been brought down on some  old creepy shit.  Not just Arabs.  Not one.  Not a one.  Not one.  Look at that.  That's how you know it's the Illuminati.  I believe it.  I believe it, but it's got nothing to do with the Illuminati.  Look at this shit here.  Look at this one.  The devil's sign.  Look at the devil's sign and look at this shit.  Look at it.  What the fuck?  That's Barbara Bush.  Why? 
[02:48:30]  Why?  Why?  They're all doing the devil's sign.  The rock and roll devil's sign.  Why?  Hello, sir.  Hello.  How are you, devil?  Hello.  Good to see you, devil worshiper.  There's a montage of various politicians and they're doing that rock and roll devil's  voice with their finger and pinky.  Look how many now.  Look, come on, man.  Oh, shit.  How many now.  Oh, back to CNN.  Oh, shit.  Look at the owl.  Back to CNN.  Oh, my God, yo.  Fuck the owl.  Back to CNN. 
[02:49:00]  The front of the courthouse.  There you go.  That's what you do to black people.  Oh, fuck your owl.  What is this?  Your black people are up to something a little more interesting than the Illuminati right  now.  The front of the courthouse is starting to look like someone dropped a cricket in front  of the ant hole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  The Illuminati.  All right.  Back to the Illuminati.  Yeah.  What's with the devil horns, though?  The devil horns.  What is that?  It's the devil.  Devil worshiper.  Fucking like Dio invented that.  What is he in charge of?  Why did it stop?  The soundtrack?  The Illuminati?  No, no, no.  No.  Because they're going to get to the money at the owl.  Listen how crazy he's going. 
[02:49:30]  Why did you stop?  All right.  I'm going again.  All right.  Here we go.  Now we got a building.  There's a lot of pyramids.  Okay.  Now look at the dollar.  What's in the corner?  Is that an owl?  Was that an owl in the dollar?  It's a slow dissolve to a goat devil.  All right.  Show me the owl.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  We got an owl.  Where's the owl?  Why is there a baby owl on the dollar bill?  Maybe to keep people from fucking counterfeiting it.  To make a detail.  What do you want?  An X on a piece of paper?  Here.  It's 100.  Take my word for it.  That's that bullshit they do on it. 
[02:50:00]  The lines and shit.  Etching.  Whatever.  All right.  What's up with the owl there, Patrice?  What does that mean then?  I don't fucking know.  There's an owl.  Another course of it.  Oh, shit.  They're morphing owl faces into everything.  Where's the owl?  There's the owl.  Okay.  It's sitting there.  It doesn't even look like it.  Uncle Sam looks like a devil goat.  Where's this dumb owl?  13 bloodlines for a very long time.  The world has been controlled by the same 13 bloodlines.  Is that true? 
[02:50:30]  Carry out their evil agenda for the new world order.  They operate through secret societies like Skull and Bones, Bohemian Club, Freemasons.  The Bill Burger.  Bill.  What?  Juice?  Here are just a few of them.  Tony Blair.  Yeah.  Gordon Brown.  David Cameron.  What?  I told you.  I've been telling you about.  I've been telling you about.  Saddam.  Well.  I've been telling you for years.  I've been trying to tell you about Herbert.  That Skull and Bones is pretty.  Yeah.  Clinton was a Skull and Bones.  Yeah.  He was.  Clinton and Bush were both Skull and Bones.  Both the Bushes and Clintons were Skull and Bones. 
[02:51:00]  No, of course it does.  They fuck each other in the ass and then take over the world.  That is what they do.  Okay.  They do weird grease up your asshole and put things in it in front of other guys.  That's what I think.  You know, frat.  Abu Ghraib.  It's a frat.  By the way, part of the conspiracy is spreading forced ass fuckings.  That's what they did in Abu Ghraib.  That's what football fraternities do.  Yeah.  They put pine cones up kids' asses.  Yeah, and then it's just gay, weird, aggressive Republicans.  And that's who runs the country.  A 9-11. 
[02:51:30]  All right, listen, listen.  We got it.  That's who runs the country.  But it's not a secret and they don't bother folding bills.  They just fuck black people up and eat their kids.  All right, listen.  We got a Mason on the phone here.  Bob in Pennsylvania.  Bob, what's up?  Oh, shit.  Hey, I just got some questions.  First of all, Patrice, I think you're funny as hell.  All he is.  I love the show.  But when you were talking before, Patrice, about the Masons and how  we're controlling the world and stuff like that, or the country,  I really don't understand.  I've been in it for the last 10 years. 
[02:52:00]  And are you aware that there are black lodges in the country?  Yeah, a lot of black Freemasons, yeah.  They're called Prince Hall Lodges.  Right.  They have a different name.  They're black.  They don't get to just be Masons.  They can't be Masons.  Well, you can be Masons, but you're Prince Hall Masons.  Ours is Studio 54.  They call it.  Yeah.  But there's nothing, I mean, I could say right now,  there's nothing secret about the Masons.  It's the tricks, man.  Maybe in the past, like during the colonial times in England 
[02:52:30]  and all that kind of stuff, maybe at that point.  But now it's more of a social...  Yeah, but you're a guy now who got in in the last 10 years.  They don't tell you everything.  It's not like they tell all their members.  It's not like they go,  Yeah, you're not the top percentile.  A new guy just joined.  Let's tell him about the $20 bill.  You're just a dude in Pennsylvania.  So tell us a little bit about what the Masons are about.  Well...  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Oh, shit. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, Patrice.  Oh, Patrice is right.  I told you.  I fucking told you.  Oh, damn.  You can see him no more.  That motherfucker is dead.  Did you see when I asked these assholes outside that shit?  And did you hear the humming star?  Uh-huh.  They all went, hmm.  It's the wicker man up in this motherfucker.  Damn, that movie was fucked up.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  Did you see that ending coming?  No.  No.  That's what I'm saying.  I did because I saw the first one, the original.  Oh, okay.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  Louis C.K., anything you're promoting today? 
[02:53:30]  No.  Really?  Just hanging?  Fucking hanging out.  Yeah, no, nothing.  You got some things going on.  I'm in Philadelphia this weekend, but it's sold out.  And then you're doing a little TV, I'm hearing.  Well, I got a CBS pilot that I'm doing with Pamela Adlon, my wife, from Lucky Louis.  We're developing a show together.  And I'm in a movie with Ricky Gervais that I'm shooting all this month.  I'm sure Jimmy Norton will be happy to know he's not included in that.  He's got nothing to do with it, no.  Nothing to do with it, no.  Who knows?  You know, try.  And Patrice O'Neill, he's playing Giggles next weekend. 
[02:54:00]  We've got a big audience.  We're bringing the bleachers in next.  So, guys, if you could do that.  We promised, like, we'd bring the bleachers in on Fridays and stuff.  We've got a nice crowd out there.  So, we'll continue in just a bit for Anthony's birthday.  Yay for me.  A guy online this morning has the best birthday cake.  I thought the assault rifle birthday cake we got was fun.  That was pretty good.  This guy got that beat big time.  Really?  Did you see it?  Is it a real assault rifle?  What does he got?  I haven't seen it.  It's a better birthday cake.  All right.  Oh, is it the one with the Brokeback Mountain one? 
[02:54:30]  You saw it?  Yeah, I did see it on the walkover, yeah.  It's really funny.  It's sexy.  We'll explain it next.  Opie and Anthony.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  You know, I thought I could do a one-cheek sneak.  The war in Iraq.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Social Security is a...  Pardon?  Wait.  Does someone have some...  A breeze for my chair?  Uh, wardrobe? 
[02:55:00]  Because we get wardrobes on here to fix something.  Wait.  I need a wardrobe.  Opie and Anthony.  Ryan!  Ryan!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh, we brought the listeners into the studio.  What's up, everybody?  Say hi to the audience.  Oh, there it is.  The live audience.  Been listening to our horrid banter during the commercials. 
[02:55:30]  Ah, we were...  You know, there was a lot of laughs in there, though.  They were enjoying it.  Uh, we were analyzing the situation.  Of course, the detectives acquitted, found not guilty on all counts in the groom slaying.  Right.  Sean Belcase.  Sean Belcase.  They're in New York City, a biggie.  And, uh, as time goes on now, uh, people are taken to the streets.  Uh, Reverend Al has started marching.  Um, and it...  It just doesn't look like this is gonna end well.  No, the crowd is getting a lot bigger.  A lot bigger.  I'm seeing crowds surge.  And Reverend Al's in the middle of this crowd somewhere. 
[02:56:00]  And, uh...  He's gonna get some people heard of him.  Anthony had a great observation on CNN.  They got Detective Michael Oliver, the white cop.  Yeah.  And he's now smiling.  He is smiling like he's had a bachelor party.  Yeah.  This motherfucker is...  Now, his picture is smiling.  I don't remember seeing a picture of him smiling when they were showing the three officers  involved in this.  They changed...  And is it a coincidence?  NY, uh, City Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch, his last name. 
[02:56:30]  Uh, just a horrible twist of fate on that joke.  Illuminati, right?  Illuminati.  You gotta blame it on the Illuminati.  It all goes back...  It goes back to that, right, Patrice?  Right after him, Darren Hanganigger is trying to give his speech.  The head of the fucking...  I've, um...  The motherfuckers are awful.  I sent a few texts out to some of the police officers I know out there on the street to  get a report back on what's happening.  But they're gonna think, uh, I want reports on very short pants that only come up to the  knees because my iPhone misspelt a word. 
[02:57:00]  Think about it.  Think about it.  All right.  Think about it.  But those letters are even...  They did, and it didn't work.  Oh, boy.  Boo!  Uh, what...  You gotta give yourself...  But the G isn't even close to the CK.  Hold on, we gotta go to the funnel meter on that last line there.  Unfortunately, my stupid machine doesn't work.  It doesn't work now?  Yeah, my machine gets one flag!  One flag for fun?  Yeah.  What were you saying, Louis CK?  I was just saying that the letter G's not very close to the C and the K.  That's probably why it didn't work.  There was too much thinking involved.  I thought it'd keep...  Too much thinking. 
[02:57:30]  Sorry, guys.  Sorry to strain your fucking brains sitting over there.  I'm cold aluminum.  Hey, we got a big star on the phones here to wish Anthony a very happy birthday, celebrating  your 44th birthday.  Who is this?  Well, you're gonna find out in a second.  Hello, sir.  Hey, man, don't set me up with the big star shit.  Oh!  Kevin.  How are you?  I thought it was Dave Rabbit.  How are you doing, man?  Yeah, happy birthday, Anthony.  Thank you, sir.  How old? 
[02:58:00]  40 flurf, as I've been told.  What are you gonna do for the big day?  Actually, tomorrow's the birthday, really.  But today, you know we're...  Well, then why the fuck am I calling in now?  Yeah, because we're...  Why don't I just call you at your house tomorrow and wish you a sincere happy birthday?  I know, that would have been better than the phony day before, only because we're on the  air and we're off tomorrow call.  Put a gun to our celebrity friend's head and make him call in the show.  Well, tomorrow, a big party going down in New York City. 
[02:58:30]  Where the hell is it?  Where is it?  Smith's?  Smith's Bar.  Yeah, gonna have a little shindig, as I like to say over there.  Lots of guns, I'd imagine.  A video game.  Oh, plenty of guns and video games.  That's my life now.  I've become...  I've really gotten bad with the gun thing.  I even have to admit it.  Did it start with the video games?  Like, your character was holding guns, so you want to have the same guns?  I have bought guns based on how they worked in the video game, which is a little odd.  That's amazing. 
[02:59:00]  As far as handguns go, I've gone a little wild on the handgun thing.  I really like...  Do you buy old ones?  No, they have to be brand new.  Oh, really?  I like brand new ones.  Although, I got one from Dr. Steve, which it amounts to...  I think it's a joke.  I think Dr. Steve wants to repair people's broken wrists.  So he gives them this gun.  They break their wrist, and then Dr. Steve has to heal it.  Just shooting it?  You take this thing back.  Yeah.  It's pretty much what amounts to a deer rifle in a handgun.  Wow. 
[02:59:30]  And it loads in the back like a howitzer.  It's like a breech loader.  You've got to twist this thing.  One shell goes in, and it'll take your arm off.  You shot it?  Yeah.  No, not yet.  That one's waiting.  But he said, please videotape when you shoot it.  And he said, get somebody else to shoot it first.  Wow.  Which is kind of fun.  But I got that, and I got a couple of other ones.  A 9mm, a .40 caliber, .45 caliber.  And I'm taking a lot of heat because I wear one around the house. 
[03:00:00]  You wear one.  Well...  Thank you, Louis.  See, everyone says that.  Like in a holster, like the sheriff?  Well, not like...  No, it's not low-slung like a sheriff or a Han Solo on the leg.  A blaster?  A blaster, holster.  I'm not wearing that.  It's concealed.  Is it a shoulder holster?  It's very concealed.  No, it's not...  A Pacino kind of?  A Pacino shoulder holster?  No.  No, it's very comfortable.  It's very form-fitting like a wallet.  It's a smaller gun.  And it's there, so...  Because if somebody breaks in your house, you have to say, excuse me, let me get my gun, 
[03:00:30]  or I hope I'm close to my gun.  Now, this is not more disturbing than folding the $20 bill into, you know, like the fact that  you walk around the house with a fucking gun.  Because there's never been home invasions on Long Island.  Never.  It's the home invasion capital.  As you're walking through the house with your ascot on and your fucking...  Ascot?  And you just have a loaded fucking gun ready for action.  I have...  Why wouldn't I wear...  That paranoia doesn't match the 9-11.  May have been a fucking self-inflicted attack. 
[03:01:00]  There are home invasions all the time on Long Island.  I understand that.  So why is it paranoia?  We're not talking about that.  You're changing...  You're walking around the fucking house with a gun on yourself, on your person.  It's security.  Just in case.  Somebody feels condoring.  Makes me feel secure.  Neither thing is paranoia.  It's both true.  It's white people run everything and black people steal.  Oh, shit.  Jesus Christ.  That's why he wears a gun. 
[03:01:30]  Thank God, Louie's a minority, too.  And that's why we're going to fold the $20 bill.  That half.  Hey, what about Kevin Smith?  When did you...  Oh, fuck.  Hold on a minute.  Hey, Kevin.  I just have this mental image of Anthony in the hunt for Red October walking around  a U-boat with a fucking gun on his head.  Waiting for the Russian spy to come out.  Dude, wearing a gun in the house.  I mean, why not just have multiple guns, one for each room, keep them handy, rather than  Yeah.  See, that is insane.  You're like the end of Young Guns. 
[03:02:00]  That is insane.  You have guns loaded in every quarter of the house.  Is there a Chinese guy that jumps out the closet and you fight him when you come in  the house?  Kato?  No, I don't have a Kato.  You're a fucking asshole.  It wasn't mad at you.  First of all, it's not as safe.  That's a pink panther reference.  That's a pink panther.  Yeah, I got it.  It's not as safe having guns laying all over your house as it is having one on you.  Do you have, like, iron windows that come down?  Nope.  Nope.  Like, searchlights that point outward from your house?  Well, no, they do point inward, though.  Not yet.  It's like, they're on my house and in the backyard. 
[03:02:30]  And then I want those scanners.  I need some scanners.  Yeah.  I'm just the...  You know what your house probably looks like?  It looks like a house from a movie where you're the last man alive and everybody else  is zombies.  Yes, legend.  Oh, I am legend.  I know.  I do have the exact same car from that.  And you could keep imagining what my house looks like, Patrice, because I don't think you'll  ever see it.  Probably not.  Oh, shit.  And he means it.  I'm kidding.  I'm going to have a big party once it's all done, and you're cordially invited. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, I'm sure.  Shut the fuck up.  Do you have a party?  Do you wear a gun?  Two neighbors will freak out.  During your parties?  I haven't had a party.  Do you wear a gun?  I haven't had a party.  I don't have people over my house.  I really want to know specifically, like, you wear a gun when you're in the house.  Yeah.  That's no joke.  So when you come, what is the routine?  That's what I am.  He puts his radio clothes away, and he puts on his cowboy outfit.  And what about when you walk around in your underwear?  Do you have, like, the holster on?  No, no.  Just your gun and your underwear?  I don't walk around with my underwear.  And somebody were like, you have women's panties with a gun? 
[03:03:30]  And I know he wears tighty-whities.  I'm fully dressed most of the time.  I walk around in my underwear.  No, I don't wear the gun.  I don't tuck it down the front.  And usually, I go to the range after work and stuff, blast off a few rounds, and I'm  dressed for it.  I have the holster on and everything.  Where is the holster when you're not in the house?  The holster is in one of my drawers.  And so you go, you get...  So I go home.  You come home, you put your keys on the night table.  I put my keys on the night table. 
[03:04:00]  I empty everything out.  I put my holster on, put my gun in it.  Pull the shirt over it.  Is it in a gun safe?  I don't have kids running around the fucking house.  Yeah, but if somebody home invades before you get home, they find your...  Yes, they are locked up.  They find your...  Okay.  They are locked up.  Hey, what about Kevin Smith?  Oh, shit!  Kevin's on the phone.  Kevin!  Is it like a Mr. Rogers thing where you come home, you pick up your radio sweater from  the closet, you put your holster and put it on?  Won't you not be my invader?  My invaders. 
[03:04:30]  Dude, you know what would be more intimidating for a home invader?  If you just walk around naked with a constant erection, you don't even need a gun, dude.  Just walk around constantly with a fucking heart on, and anybody coming into your house  will immediately turn around and leave.  You know, Kevin, people don't understand.  Long Island, there's a lot of home invasions.  And if you're this guy, just please try to picture this.  You're home.  And it happens.  The people that have been invaded on, this has happened.  They're coming home, they're doing something, they go outside, or they think UPS is at 
[03:05:00]  the door, whatever it is.  Someone gains entrance into their house.  Do you think for a second they're thinking, I sure am glad I don't have a gun on me?  Or do you think everybody in that situation goes, fuck, I wish I had a gun on me right  now?  I know exactly how to deal with home invaders.  I've taken practice for it, training.  If I encounter a home invader in my home, immediately start crying and offer to suck  his dick to let me live.  Hey, Anthony, do you hand out guns to all your visitors when they come over? 
[03:05:30]  Like party favors.  That would be awesome.  Everybody gets to carry.  No, I don't.  I think it takes a lot of courage to admit that you have a gun around your house.  Because I'm sure a lot of people do it and they don't tell their friends.  Why wouldn't you tell?  I'm a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association.  From my cold dead ends.  It's getting really busy.  We got Keith the cop on.  Kevin Smith is still on the line as well.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, no, no.  I'm over at the house.  And I was just thinking, Anthony, can I have permission if I just went upstairs and we 
[03:06:00]  just pal-talked Cameron the gun closet real quick?  Could we do that?  No, do not pal-talk my gun closet.  I don't.  Just the way they're laid all over the place.  The ex's closet is now the gun closet.  Get rid of the fucking shoes and bring on the guns.  That's a nice trade right there.  That's pretty much it.  Look at Patrice just shaking his head.  What's wrong, Patrice?  It's just that...  That's paranoia. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, it's just that, you know, dismiss Illuminati.  And this maniac walking around the house 365 days a year preparing for a fucking home  invasion.  You know, it's just...  But they go hand in hand because the Illuminati is based on white paranoia.  Right.  That long ago, we knew we were afraid of black people.  And we started etching things in Dollar Bill to send each other signals of what to do  in the country.  If someone gains entry into my house...  I don't understand.  I know, I'm Mexican.  How do you do that, though?  Why do you do that?  And how do you do that?  Because it doesn't matter even though I'm from Mexico. 
[03:07:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Because my skin is white and I look like other people.  But are you undercover or something?  I hope so.  Are you trying to help us at all?  I'm white.  No, I'm a white guy whose family has been hurting brown Mexicans for many generations.  So that's what we do over there.  But you don't seem like you enjoy...  Yeah.  You have a white guilt that he doesn't really embrace at all.  It's a weird thing, Louie.  Why do you do that?  Because of his Mexican heritage.  It's something going on there.  You want to embrace your Mexican heritage, but you're scared of losing some of these deals 
[03:07:30]  that you get by a white guy.  Because he's a white guy.  Wouldn't you?  Louie is a complete white guy.  I don't have a fucking choice.  I'm me, motherfucker.  Yeah, I know.  I can't trick nobody into not being me.  I know, but that's exactly it.  But you're a tricky, red-headed Mexican who has a forehead of hair that he cut to make  him look like an old white guy.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  Wouldn't you?  Wouldn't you?  No, man!  If you were from a family of Mexicans and you came out looking white, wouldn't you take  all the advantages of the benefit of the doubt from police? 
[03:08:00]  I would try to be their leader.  You know?  The leader of the Mexicans?  I would try to be the leader of the Mexicans.  The assimilated, gentrified Mexican leader.  We'll go back there and run for president.  We should.  Hey, what about Kevin Smith?  Holy shit, Kevin's still on the phone.  Sorry, Kevin.  It's not even your fucking birthday.  I want to go back to bed.  I know.  Let Kevin go to sleep.  He's in L.A.  We're forcing all these guys to get up early just to wish Anthony a happy birthday.  Hey, really fast.  A lot of people are wondering, how did Jimmy do on your movie? 
[03:08:30]  Jimmy did great, man.  He's still in there.  Awesome.  He's not on the floor yet.  That's good.  No, no.  He won't hit the floor.  He's pretty secure at this point.  He did great.  Awesome.  It's akin to the Spider-Man appearance.  In fact, he probably had more screen time in Spider-Man.  Oh, no.  But he gets to be more Jimmy in this than he did in Spider-Man, I think.  Nice.  Very good.  Kevin, thank you so much for calling.  Happy birthday, sir.  When I'm back east, I'll check in and visit.  Yeah.  I think mid-May, May 14th, 15th, I think we're going to play poker at the Stash. 
[03:09:00]  I want to play poker and let's fleece our fans again.  That was fun, counting our money at the end of the night.  You mean fleece my fans.  You didn't have any fans there.  I had two.  They were all talking about Stern.  Who are you kidding me?  Stern.  All right, Kevin.  Happy birthday, sir.  Kevin Smith, everyone.  Bye.  We've got to go right.  That bastard.  No, first of all, that bastard.  I did have fans there.  Who?  And there were fans.  Who?  Well, they were his fans, too. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, okay.  But they were fans of the show.  And I was nice enough.  See, he had to bring that up.  I was nice enough to say, when he said he has a way of getting rid of Home Invaders,  I was going to say, what, do you play Jersey Girl?  Oh, see, you know.  What?  That's uncalled for.  He's a friend.  I know, and that's why he shouldn't have said I had no fans there.  Yeah.  I'm kidding.  I love Kevin Smith.  You want to call him back?  Retroactive heckle.  I wouldn't have done it in front of him.  Because I like playing poker over there.  Makes me feel like a celebrity.  Anthony, we've got another birthday wish.  We go right back to the phones. 
[03:10:00]  Hello?  Who's this?  Who's this?  Hey, it's Joe Rogan.  What's going on, guys?  Joe!  Hey.  Nice.  I wish he was here to give me a pot lollipop.  Can you handle it?  I don't know.  I wouldn't be able to.  Hey, Joe, we needed you yesterday.  We had Rainica, what's his name there?  Rainica Tour?  Yeah, thank you.  Tour.  He was in yesterday.  What an animal.  Yeah, he's like 45 years old, too.  Isn't that crazy?  He doesn't look it.  He's still slinging.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, happy birthday, sir. 
[03:10:30]  Thank you, Joe.  How about you, man?  Are you telling people?  Uh, 40-flurf.  Really?  Yeah.  40-flurf.  That's not bad.  40-flurf.  I said that the other day.  It was one of those, you know, I still think I'm like 44.  What does it matter?  You're not a woman?  I know.  I said I'm 47.  Yeah, there you go.  But I was like, 40-flurf.  Because I said that, not trying to cover it up.  It just popped out of my mouth like that.  When I turned 40, it didn't bother me nearly as much as starting to get gray ball hairs.  That really sucked. 
[03:11:00]  Gray ball hairs.  Yeah, I found three gray ball hairs before I started shaving my balls.  It was an excuse to start shaving my balls.  But the truth is, it was to hide the gray ball hairs.  It was too much, man.  Gray ball hairs, that's your body saying, you know, fuck it making ball hair color.  Let's just keep this dude alive.  Do they have just for men for balls?  It's not like it's going to drive.  Probably, they probably do.  It's not going to hurt getting laid.  Because by the time a woman's seeing your ball hairs, you've closed the deal pretty much. 
[03:11:30]  She backs out on a gray ball hair.  He's going to be like, oh, wait a minute, you're an old guy.  You have gray ball hair, I'm out of here.  I had my nose two inches from your dick.  And I saw gray ball hair and went, oh, wait a minute, you're an old guy.  I don't have gray pubes, but I do have, probably have four gray ball hairs.  Wow, you should pluck them.  I yank those suckers out like I was Chuck Norris pulling POWs out of bamboo cages. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, you got to look at it.  It's a positive.  Your balls are getting this patina.  This sort of...  Patina.  It is.  Yes, it's showing age fine.  Yeah, they're fine aging.  They're, yeah.  Joe, what do you...  White leaves.  I know you're like, you're your own fucking lethal weapon.  Joe is very good.  Yeah, with the martial arts.  What do you feel about guns?  How do you feel about firearms?  I have guns.  Do you?  I have guns.  I have a compound bow.  That's my favorite thing.  I like to shoot compound bow and arrows in two.  I have like fake pigs in my backyard.  Fake pigs? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, they're leather pigs.  Call police officers, sir.  What kind of year is this?  Leather pigs?  Yeah, you buy them at an archery store.  It's fun.  Yeah, you ever see that?  I hope I don't ever have to shoot anybody.  Yeah, see, that's it.  You hope, but you're prepared.  Yeah, I definitely would not want...  I mean, it's that old expression, better to have a gun and not need it than to need it  and not have it.  Thank you.  There's a lot of douchebags out there, man.  Exactly.  Joe, have you ever worn...  Do you have handguns?  Yes.  Have you ever worn your handgun around your house? 
[03:13:00]  When I first moved to L.A., I was super paranoid, and I did it a couple of times.  Let me ask Joe this, man.  Let me ask you this, Joe.  All right.  It was retarded, too.  Patrice wants to know if you've ever folded a $20 bill and seen the Twin Towers in the  back of it because there's a big conspiracy of white people.  Joe believes in conspiracies.  I know he does.  Very few conspiracies.  I'm accredited for much more conspiracies than I actually believe in.  Yeah, that's true.  And let me ask you this, Joe.  Which is a conspiracy.  I guarantee in his difference from you and Joe, Joe, do you do all this gun stuff strictly 
[03:13:30]  from the fear, niggas?  Wait a minute.  Wow.  Thank you.  Joe doesn't do it from paranoia fear of black people.  You are putting a racial thing on my paranoia of just being broken into.  Oh, really?  You're afraid of white home invaders?  There are people from Brentwood who are Hispanic that will also break into my house.  Puerto Ricas and blacks.  Yeah, but Anthony, when you're strapping your gun on and you have a very vivid image in  your mind, it's a black guy. 
[03:14:00]  It's not one of my Jewish neighbors going, hey, hey, he's home and he's on.  That's the thing.  What does he look like?  What does he look like?  The fear is black, right?  Be honest.  What does he look like?  He looks like Jeff Goldblum from Death Wish, the first one.  Fuck you.  With the fucking Jughead hat, beating fucking Bronson's wife and calling her a rich cunt.  He looks like Swan from the Warriors.  He's like, okay, what does he really look like? 
[03:14:30]  Here he is.  Yeah, he comes in.  Goddamn rich cunts.  I kill rich cunts.  Jeff Goldblum in his greatest role ever.  I kill rich cunts.  Yeah, let me think.  He looks like Damon Jossu.  I'll tell you what he looks like.  He looks like every home invader I've seen arrested on the news from Long Island.  That's all I'll say.  Black.  Home invasions are the scariest thing ever.  That's way more scary than getting your car stolen or something like that.  If somebody's breaking into your house and they're locked behind the door with you, that's a very scary feeling. 
[03:15:00]  Oh my God.  You said you'd let me be racist for my birthday, Patrice.  Happy birthday, yes.  Yes.  It's wearing thin with Patrice.  Oh, I know.  He's like disgusted with my racism.  I'm overdoing it.  I do agree because sometimes I have problems sleeping at night because my door is right on the ground level and shit.  I've done some things.  I'm not allowed to put bars and shit because it's condos.  So I can't put real protective stuff, which is what makes me feel better.  I got an alarm.  Yeah, but by the time the cops show up, you could be dead.  That's what I say. 
[03:15:30]  I had an apartment in Boston where the door just went right out to the street.  It was a two-family house.  And the landlord came one day and took the door.  He said, I have to fix the door.  We did an episode about it on Lucky Louie.  Oh, right.  That's why I was thinking, wait a minute.  That didn't happen.  That was on the show, you asshole.  It really did happen.  And I had no door and it was just, and Reggie McFadden was staying over and he slept in the living room with just an open door.  We're just going to the street.  Open door.  Balls.  Just under the street. 
[03:16:00]  See, Somerville, Massachusetts.  See, Joe, I am not going to be somebody that I know, when there is a home invasion, you know the people that are invaded are sitting there going,  God, I just wish I had a gun.  I wish I had a gun.  And they don't.  And they get beaten.  They may have to sit there and watch their wife and daughters be raped.  You don't think the home invaders stake out the joint a little bit?  What?  Do you think they stake out the joint?  They might.  They stake your home out.  They might.  And know who they can do things to. 
[03:16:30]  They might.  So why wouldn't I be somebody that might look like they could be a victim?  Because I'm walking around my house with guns?  You're worried that if you think about this all the time, this is something you dwell on, that you might actually somehow or another manifest it?  I don't.  There you go.  There's the real Joe.  Joe is magical.  Yeah.  And he likes magical shit.  That's why I know Joe believes he fucking floats in some type of weird Buddha position.  Because he smokes pot.  Because he smokes a lot of marijuana.  Floats in a Buddha position.  I know he does.  Joe can fly. 
[03:17:00]  Joe can fly.  He's a Jedi.  And I know he believes in some of these paranoid, what they call, quote unquote, paranoid things about government.  Anybody who smokes as much pot as him will believe anything for a few minutes at least.  I know he does everything, man.  He's a very spiritual guy.  I know.  He's believed in Allah and Jesus for a few minutes.  There's a lot of black people's thoughts.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  What?  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Black people's paranoia that white people dismiss as nonsense. 
[03:17:30]  Hmm.  Well, I think there might be something to the idea of thinking on something so long that you can manifest it.  See, that's not what I'm doing.  I'm being, I'm prepared.  I don't dwell on it.  I don't sit there and roll out of bed and practice my quick draw.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  Do you ever sleep with a gun under your pillow?  Yes.  No.  That's fucking dangerous.  Yeah, but isn't that when you would be most likely to be invaded?  Dude, it's...  Where's your gun when you're sleeping? 
[03:18:00]  About a foot away from me on my night table.  All right.  Really?  So somebody can sneak up and quite click.  Well, you know something, then?  God bless that fucking ninja.  Have you ever, like, investigated on, like, Google something, one of those mechanisms  that make a small derringer slide out of your...  No, I've never gone for the taxi driver, slip it out of my fucking wrist kind of thing.  You don't need that.  As long as you're...  I have the security in knowing I'm an armed citizen in this country. 
[03:18:30]  And what is your gun of protection?  My gun of choice?  The one you carry with you to kill black people.  To kill black people?  Well, it all depends on the situation, but I would say, to conceal and carry, it's the  .40 caliber.  And then at home, for the home protection and just the night table, it's .45 with a hollow  point.  Jesus Christ, you don't fuck around.  No.  They aren't getting down the hallway. 
[03:19:00]  You know what gun that is?  Yeah.  This is how awful you are.  That's the gun that Chief Brody put cyanide in to kill Jaws.  That's how he's going to treat a black man coming to his house.  His Jaws.  He's going to shoot him with a shark gun.  Chief Brody.  No, you know, and then I have a nine, and that's just for fun.  That's for scaring people away.  With grace, you don't believe in guns?  I can't carry one.  There's no way I can get a fucking gun.  See?  Why not?  Oh, well. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, but unless it's, you know.  Do you have a record?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about you, Louie?  Do you have any guns?  No, I got kids.  I can't have guns.  See, kids and guns don't mix.  It's really difficult.  I understand that whole thing.  If I didn't have kids, I'd probably have a gun just for fun.  And kids, you could put a fucking gun in a block of cement, and a kid will fucking  shoot into his head.  I have a fake gun.  Dumb fucking kids.  I have a replica.  Louie has sarcasm.  I would love to just see Louie get pissed with what his sarcasm is on to a home invader. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, you want to take it?  I ain't using it.  I actually have a replica 9mm that shoots blanks.  Well, that's good.  Loud blanks.  And they'll give you a replica beating.  And I'm at the country house upstate, and I used to shoot it at deer.  I used to shoot deer to get them off the yard.  What do they do?  They just look at me.  They don't care.  They don't care.  They actually know they're blanks.  They look at me.  Do you also have a switchblade comb?  You guys remember that actor that shot himself in the head a few years back?  John Eric Hexum. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, with blanks and killed himself.  Yeah, he had blanks in the gun.  He put it up to his temple and pulled the trigger, and the temple, part of his skull acted as  a bullet because it was so close to his head and sent his skull into his brain and killed  him.  Stupid asshole.  What a dummy.  Stupid dead faggot.  Uh-oh.  Jesus.  I have no idea.  I have no idea who the guy is.  It's been so long that no one around cares about him anymore, so it's okay.  I don't care.  Yeah.  I brought it up laughing on a set once when I was on the TV show Hardball, and one of 
[03:21:00]  the actors actually knew the guy.  Oh, good.  Sorry.  Fuck him, too.  Fuck him, too.  Fucking couple of stupid fags.  They're all actors or faggots.  He said that wasn't the first shot he took to the head.  Yeah.  Fucking shot him a head and a load on the chin.  Especially with this group.  It's a fucking cum joke, for Christ's sake.  Joe Rogan, thanks so much for calling.  Yes, Joe.  Thank you.  You promoting anything, Joe?  You're promoting anything or what?  Nope.  Nothing good.  Just getting up to say happy birthday, Anthony.  Joe. 
[03:21:30]  Thank you, Joe Rogan.  Thank you, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Joe.  Is Kung Lee the best guy in the world right now?  No.  No.  Anderson Silva would kill him.  Anderson Cooper?  Just checking.  He's very good.  All right.  Just checking.  I don't think Anderson Silva and PJ Penn are the two best guys.  In the world, pound for pound.  All right.  Fair enough.  Just finding out about Kung Lee.  But what do I know?  You know, it's just guesswork.  Joe knows his shit.  I don't know anything.  That's why I asked him.  I was asking him.  Guesswork.  Yeah, Patrice is bragging about this.  What's his name again?  Kung Fu.  Chung Wan.  Kung Lee, man.  Kung Lee.  Kung Lee.  I'm a big Frank Shamrock guy, man. 
[03:22:00]  And he beat Frank pretty bad.  Kobe Wang.  Well, Frank is a very well-rounded guy.  Fucking Charlie Chan.  A lot of well-rounded guys is well-rounded guys a lot of times are not really good at one  specific thing.  And when you fight a guy like Kung Lee, who's really good at one specific thing, which is  stand up, you know, you get fucked up.  But he wouldn't take him down, though, Joe.  He couldn't take him down.  Kung Lee was a college wrestler with a very good pedigree.  He's a much better wrestler than Frank.  Oh, he couldn't take him.  I thought Frank didn't want to.  No, no. 
[03:22:30]  He tried to take him down.  He tried to take him down to get stuff.  And how about Kimbo Slice?  So he just wanted to stand up with him.  Kimbo?  What do you think of Kimbo Slice?  Kimbo's a tough guy.  I mean, anybody who fights in backyards, bare-knuckle fights, and then puts it on the internet.  No, no.  Not his toughness, but could he handle, say, Frank Murr or somebody?  You know what?  That all makes me think.  I mean, he has to fight these guys.  Who knows?  I mean, so far, he looks great.  And do you still have hope in Brock Lesnar?  Brock Lesnar is one of those gigantic fucking farm boys with big canned hams for hands. 
[03:23:00]  That's a scary dude.  He's a real all-American wrestler, too.  It's all the same.  I mean, if he dedicates himself 100% to MMA, yeah, he could be a force.  He's still young.  He's still, I mean, he's a huge fucking guy.  He's incredibly athletic.  He was throwing Frank Murr around until he just fucked up.  And it's just like what I said about Kun Lee.  He's a specialist at one thing.  He's a phenomenal wrestler.  Those are the most dangerous guys.  The guys who come into mixed martial arts with one thing that they do very, very well. 
[03:23:30]  You know, whether it's Thai boxing, whether it's boxing, whether it's wrestling, one thing that they're super special is that.  The well-rounded guys like Frank Shamrock, they always are going to get fucked up by the guys that are specialists, in my opinion.  Damn.  Damn.  What's his name?  Floyd Mayweather really going to do this?  I don't think so.  I think he's going to cross over.  I think he's just fucking around.  No, he'll get beat real bad, man.  He's a little guy.  But he's good.  He'd be really dangerous if he fought little 147-pound guys.  You know, the UFC has a 155-pound division. 
[03:24:00]  And as long as these guys didn't try to take him down, he'd be really dangerous.  But it would be so easy for them to take him down.  And then he would be helpless.  Yeah, he would just...  No, he wouldn't be able to wrestle.  Well, on top of it, Floyd breaks his hands really easily.  He's broken his hands a bunch of fire.  Yeah, he's got his stuff.  Yeah.  Yep.  And he's got those...  He's a defensive guy.  Yeah, well, he's a good...  He's just got that shoulder.  He makes people hit him in the shoulder.  He's got very brittle hands.  Louie, you're all into boxing now, right?  I do.  I like boxing.  Are you boxing?  I work out in a boxing gym a lot. 
[03:24:30]  And my trainer has me...  He has women fighters that are, like, professional.  And I fight with them a lot.  I'm not allowed to hit them.  It's to work on my defense.  You fight girls.  I fight girls all the time.  What is with white guys beating us now?  What?  White guys are winning.  Are winning at boxing.  The only, like, really angry ones, like Kelly Pavlik and the Russians.  Kelly Pavlik is awesome.  You know who Mickey...  The boy from, uh...  The boy from...  What do you call him?  Kalsaki.  Yeah, Kalsaki.  Kalsaki.  You know, Mickey Ward?  You remember who he was?  Sure. 
[03:25:00]  Mickey Ward is working on the movie I'm working on with up in Lowell, Mass.  And he's going to start training me.  So I'm training with Mickey Ward, who's a great Irish boxer.  That palooka.  Don't ever put great...  Like sluggers ever.  Greatest.  He wasn't great.  He was great with Gotti.  Him and Gotti were great together.  That's right.  He's a palooka from South Boston, and I don't like him.  What'd you say?  He's from Lowell, Mass.  He's from Lowell, Mass.  It's all his name.  What'd you call me?  You heard me, Punchy.  What are you working on, Louie?  What is it? 
[03:25:30]  Ricky Gervais is making a movie, and I'm playing his best friend in that movie.  That's huge.  That's awesome.  And it has boxing in it?  No, I just box.  I've been for the last couple of years working on a boxing gym.  Because I like it.  I just shot another special, and I was training for the special, but then I kept going after  the special.  Let me tell you something.  Louie looks just like the guy that raped the guy from Shawshank Redemption.  You look like, oh my God.  Oh, Jesus.  I happily accept that.  You look like one of the sisters.  Oh, the head sisters. 
[03:26:00]  He looks like the head sister.  The head sister.  Louie wants to rape people.  Awesome.  Totally.  Totally.  He's going to be great.  Oh, is that awful?  No, I like when I was getting ready for the special, I was boxing a lot, like sparring  with guys.  I like sparring and getting hurt and getting panicked.  You know what it's like, Joe?  Is that a midlife crisis?  No, you know what?  The givers told me that you started boxing with people, and I was like, oh man, you got  to be real careful, you know, who you do that with.  Well, no, I know.  I have a trainer who doesn't put me in the ring with anybody who's going to really fuck 
[03:26:30]  me up, and I wear headgear and shit.  Headgear almost protects you less.  Yeah, no, I know.  Oh, I got a black eye.  Right before the special I did, I got a black eye, and it barely heals.  And you look like you got a dangerous nine-inch reach.  What headgear is that keeps you from getting caught, but the really dangerous thing is  the cutting blows to the brain.  Yeah, you can't see as well.  I don't like the headgear.  Why'd you start that now?  Yeah, I don't like it either.  Because the thing you get from it is trying to think under pressure, because you start,  as soon as you're in the ring with...  Play fucking GTA. 
[03:27:00]  If you're in the ring with anybody, you start panicking and breathing too heavily and overusing  your muscles, so if you can train yourself to be really cool and actually use your brain  and make decisions under pressure...  Have you ever fought?  Are you a fighter?  It translates to being a better comedian.  It actually does.  Are you a fighter?  I'm sure the pressure part.  It does.  Yeah.  What?  Have you ever fought in real life, gotten in fights?  Not really, no.  I mean, I never backed down from...  I was always bigger than kids my age.  So kids...  What the fuck did you go to school, China?  Nobody ever really picked fights with me when I was a kid. 
[03:27:30]  I never backed down from anything, but nobody ever really...  Really?  Yeah, I never really got in a fight.  But were you scared when you had a line-up?  One kid...  Because I was always fucking petrified whenever it was like, oh my god, I'm getting in a fight.  Holy shit, this sucks.  When I was in high school, when I was a senior in high school, a freshman out of nowhere,  this little Irish fucking tough kid started picking fights with me.  You look like the Notre Dame logo?  He just picked me out in the hallway and said, hey, you faggot, fuck you or something.  And I said, fuck you.  And he goes, what do you mean, fuck you?  I'm like, you just said faggot, fuck you. 
[03:28:00]  So I said, fuck you back.  And he's like, don't say fuck you to me, I'll kick your ass.  And he started his fight with me.  And every time I saw him, he'd threaten to kick my ass.  And I was scared of him.  He was more small than me.  And that's why he's boxing now, because that guy just my-spaced him.  Yeah, hey, fuck you, faggot.  I'll see you in Philly.  I know who you're going to be.  Hey, Joe.  And Joe's been there.  I just want to say, I haven't met Joe until later, much later when I started.  He had left Boston. 
[03:28:30]  But Joe was known to be dangerous since 91.  Like when I first started comedy, Joe Rogan, they were so happy for him to leave.  Because Joe was fucking-  I've never seen anything to anybody.  But the idea of you, you know, the idea of it was his, he was legend.  That is his-  Now the story I remember hearing about Joe was that when he was in high school, and actually  I think he told me this story, because it was a lesson in how to really defend yourself,  that some kid came up to him in the lunch line in high school and started talking some 
[03:29:00]  shit to him.  And most people, like, wait for the drama to build and for the fight.  What was this, juvie?  Wait for a bunch of kids to gather and start saying, fight, fight, fight.  But as soon as the kid came up to him in a threatening manner and said one word, Joe just punched  him in the chest really hard.  And the kid fell down.  And his face fell right in the potato post and the Jell-O.  And it was all fucking-  And it was all-  Joe knew the prison rules early, you know?  You just gotta take out the guy. 
[03:29:30]  Somebody goes, hey man, poo!  Ow!  I was never very big.  I was always a short dude.  So in high school, I was an easy guy to pick on.  And I didn't like the whole idea of getting hit first and having to recover.  So I'm like, I never picked on anybody.  I never started fights ever.  But if somebody was going to start a fight with me, for sure I was going to hit them first.  Yeah, preemptive George Bush stuff.  And I commend you, right?  I did.  I never told you this, but I think I did.  But anyway, that you never hit Carlos. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, I would never hit that guy.  That he himself was punished by the night.  That he never-  He never-  And anytime I was looking at any YouTube, I just go, oh no, man.  He's gonna punch him.  Doesn't he know?  And it's just like, you know, because something changed me.  Because I've seen Joe in men's house.  You can see it in Carlos' eyes in the clip.  In men's house.  He was-  Joe was in men's health.  Yeah, he's on the cover of men's health.  If you're in men's health magazine.  He was doing one-finger push-ups, I'm like, Jesus, he's gonna kill Carlos, but he never 
[03:30:30]  fucking got to that mode, which was like, you know, I was happy for him, you know, because  it was almost like that goading, kind of hit me thing.  Yeah, but you could see it in Carlos' eyes, like, I've heard this guy kicks people's asses.  You could see him holding back a little bit.  Yeah, if Carlos stopped short, a lot of times, just short of Joe kicking his ass.  He called me a little bitch quite a few times, though, which I thought was pretty bold.  Good math.  I would call Joe a little bitch.  It's like a little dog barking at you, like, oh, look at this cute little thing. 
[03:31:00]  Just give him a fucking fear factor beating, making me a sheep uterus while he's kicking  him in his face.  Sheep uterus.  Eat, eat, eat this cow tongue, bitch.  Show his face in my face.  Let's get Joe.  Joe, thank you so much for calling for Answers.  Oh, thank you, guys.  You know what?  Every time I call him, it's always the same.  I always get jealous.  I feel like you guys are having so much fun.  I wish I was there.  Well, come see us, man.  Yeah, anytime, man.  If I was in New York, for sure I would. 
[03:31:30]  All right, cool.  See you, Joe.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Joe Rogan, everyone.  We're going to take a quick break.  Feels good shit.  And we'll continue.  Louis C.K. in studio, but also Patrice O'Neal is going to be at Giggles in Seattle next  weekend.  Thank you.  Boom.  I like guns.  I love being armed.  Are you insane?  Oh.  Oh.  You know, some girls actually enjoy having a gun put to their head while you fuck them.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He's nuts.  He's just fucking nuts. 
[03:32:00]  I'm having a fine show today.  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Anthony's birthday.  Hey, where's that birthday cake?  What?  What?  They brought in more than one?  The new one that I saw.  This guy. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  You got to see this cake, man.  What's your name, sir?  Jack.  Hey, Jack.  Where are you from?  From Rockaway Beach.  Nice.  And you went out of your way to get Anthony a birthday.  Yeah.  Just figured a little something nice.  For Ant.  We've been fans since the N.E.W. days.  Isn't that wonderful?  Yeah.  Somebody described the cake.  What's his name?  Heath Ledger, the dead guy from the broke back.  The gay cowboy movie, right?  Dead gay cowboy movie.  Jesus. 
[03:33:00]  So far, it's accurate.  What did it say?  We're glad you made it another year.  Not everyone did.  Because he's dead.  And it's happy 44th birthday from your pals at chuckledumper.com.  Wow.  Is that really a website?  Yeah.  It's a dopey humor website we've been running for.  And what's it?  Get employed.  It's chuckledumper.com.  Chuckle.  Chuckle dumper.  Wow.  You got the chuckle dumper.  Lucrative chuckle dumper.  Laughs and come in the ass all at the same time. 
[03:33:30]  Nice.  Very cool.  Well, thank you, sir.  Thanks, guys.  Yep.  No one's ever going to eat that.  And it just...  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock Melita.  Slightest of...  That fucking...  Stranger cake.  That fucking...  Stranger cake.  E-Rock's baking commercial is going to be a hit next week on the show.  Oh, yeah.  We'll play that into the ground.  Oh, the Asian thing, Patrice.  I think that's the last thing we have today.  Yeah.  Patrice gave us, like...  Yeah, be racist for a little while. 
[03:34:00]  I'm tired of it.  I'm going to take a break.  Oh, yeah.  Let's tag team.  I'm going to tag you, and you'd just be racist.  I think I've been okay, though.  You have.  I mean, from time to time, I slipped out of forgetting it's your birthday.  That's okay.  But you see how easy it is to be racist?  Because your Asian rant was pretty damn good.  Yeah, you know, it's just...  Patrice, he walks in at 5 o'clock.  I just got to say, within 15 minutes, he gives us probably eight hours of radio.  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, why don't you save some of this for the air?  But it's very dangerous, like, to talk about it on the air, though, because they just...  You know, I don't get along with them. 
[03:34:30]  They just...  You don't get along with Asians in general.  Asians, I just do not.  I'm sure there's one out there that...  One.  You know, here's a question.  Jackie Chan?  How many times...  And this includes anybody.  White people to black, black to white.  How many times can you have a bad experience with a motherfucker before you go, I don't like  any of them?  No, it's like when you talk to waitresses about black guys not tipping, and it's really  hard to argue with them.  It's really hard.  Like, a waitress will tell you, I've been waiting tables for 40 years, and no black person has 
[03:35:00]  ever given me a single tip.  Why the fuck would I not think that black people don't tip?  That seems to be a problem.  How many are you allowed?  Like, okay, I'll give that.  A waitress goes, look, four black people haven't tipped this week.  I'll let you go.  It's a slow fucking restaurant.  Yeah, here's the thing, is that no matter how many black guys haven't tipped that waitress,  when she sees a black person walk in the door and says, that person's not going to tip,  she's being prejudiced.  There's no other way to look at it.  Because that could be the one. 
[03:35:30]  Some people could agree or disagree whether she should be, but she is being prejudiced.  There's no other way to look at it.  And here's the thing, is how many white people have not tipped her that she hasn't counted?  She's been counting black guys.  Foreign white people are the worst not tippers ever.  But since the day she started her job, she's been counting non-tipping black motherfuckers.  But she hasn't been, the white people haven't been accumulating for her.  Which is fair, it's very fair to me.  And this is why Asians, my thing with them is that the most...  This is a great bit, man.  They're the most not loyal to your patronage of their fucking place. 
[03:36:00]  There's a Chinese restaurant, I eat all that, they call me by my first name.  And these motherfuckers won't get...  They treat me exactly the same as they did when I first went in there and they thought  I was a nigga that didn't tip, I give them everything and they still...  Not even a free egg roll, nothing.  They treat you like an Asian.  Like, you know, that funky, non-happy, unfunny, not knowing you shit. 
[03:36:30]  You understand what I'm saying?  That's so effing true, man.  I fucking go to this...  I got an Asian laundry person, an Asian dry cleaner, an Asian guy that cleans my fish tank,  and that motherfucker...  That motherfucker charges me $226.10.  Every time.  Every time.  To clean your fish tank.  And 10 cents.  He nickels and dimes me every fucking time.  He doesn't even let you slide on the 10? 
[03:37:00]  If he buys me some food, right?  If I go, look, I need some food.  And the food is $14.99.  That motherfucker puts $14.99.  Not that one time put, hey, hey, put you $12.  Yeah, yeah, just to say, just something.  Nobody does, just, and not funny, and passive-aggressive.  How about they just acknowledge you once?  I go to the same dry cleaning guy.  I've been going for easily three years.  He doesn't even acknowledge that I've been, like, going to his joint for three years. 
[03:37:30]  He looks at me like I'm a complete stranger every time I walk in there.  Are you outward and friendly towards the person?  Yes, I'm one of those guys, because I'm socializing and stuff.  I walk in, I see the same fucking guy for three years, and he looks at me like I'm a stranger  every fucking time.  Good morning.  My mind just goes, good morning.  And I go, I come in here so much, he goes, phone number, please.  I go, man, you should remember my motherfucking phone number right now.  646.  Blasey, blasey. 
[03:38:00]  He just, okay.  Because other places will remember your phone number.  I bring in, I, this motherfucker go like this.  I go, I brought in some, my suit jackets to get clean.  I go, well, how much are these, like, five?  He goes, no, no, no, no.  Oh, like laughing at you, like, hey.  $6.95, you goofy motherfucker.  It's like, how dare you make that mistake, nigga?  You could have made a mistake up, but not down.  You crazy?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  But they're just the awful, just, in terms of, and this is the thing, you get, you know, 
[03:38:30]  oh, they're talking about how awful Asians are.  Now, it's just an observation.  I may, there may be an Asian out there, because I know some, some of my friends who actually,  you know, get to fuck Asian girls.  I knew you were going to say some of my friends are Asians.  No.  Some of my friends get to fuck Asian girls.  I don't have any Asian friends.  I don't.  I don't.  And the Asians I deal with are just, they just annoy you.  You're going to the Chinese restaurant.  Let me tell you something.  If I knew how to make my own beef and broccoli, I would never talk to a Chinese person in my 
[03:39:00]  fucking life.  It's not just beef and broccoli and stir it around, right?  If I knew how to make a Chinese restaurant tasting Chinese food, I've done it.  I've Googled General Chow's chicken.  Yeah.  And I, it tastes like dog shit.  Came out like fucking Lieutenant Chow.  It didn't quite.  I want to take the, I want to take the, I want to take the, I want to take the plate  down there and go, taste this.  Tell me what is missing. 
[03:39:30]  So I don't have to have to come in here again.  They'll charge you for that knowledge.  I have, I'm racist in one way, which is my, my dick is racist.  I'm sexually racist.  Are you?  That don't sound, see, you might be fucking gay, because that doesn't even sound right.  Men are not racist against pussy.  Like, I'll fuck a Chinese bitch if she's, you know, wants to pull it out.  Yeah, but that's the thing with me.  I'm the opposite.  I have black friends, Asian friends.  I don't see differences in that way, but in the way people are. 
[03:40:00]  But black women, I just, I don't get hard.  Not attracted.  Don't get hard to black women.  And Asian women, like Asian women from behind are the sexiest women on the, they just have  great asses and the long hair.  Really?  And they turn around and my dick just goes down.  I can't.  Fucking Louie is a sissy.  And I just realized that just now.  I cannot believe that.  But every white woman in the world, I'll fuck her.  But any black women, I just don't.  Asian women's asses are unbelievable.  Let me just, I'm just.  How is that possible?  I like a round tight ass.  They're usually a little, I've noticed they're usually a little, like, flat. 
[03:40:30]  I don't look like CD cases.  Damn D, you number one worse ass.  Well, it's all, you know.  You're thinking like the occasional, you're thinking like the occasional Lucy Liu ass or  something like that.  Like that.  Like occasionally you'll get something.  Yeah.  What's the problem, Mars?  Oh.  That's the problem.  Okay.  Oh, it was on.  Mars basically is saying what everyone's thinking.  Patrice doesn't need two microphones in front of him. 
[03:41:00]  Mars had to come in and turn one of them off.  Thank you, Mars.  I'm the same way, though.  I'm racist as far as.  No, I just can't be attracted to, I don't know why, but I've never seen a black woman  that gave me a bummer.  The only black woman I find attractive is like, yeah, white looking black women.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Like a white woman with a tan.  Ooh, ghetto black.  Yeah, okay.  Ghetto black is where it's at.  Is it insecurity, is it insecurity thinking that all black women like big giant dicks?  No, because I do have a kind of a big dick.  You're packing. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  I don't believe that at all.  I have a nice dick and a pretty big dick.  Really?  I've been told by enough women that I believe it now.  I've been told by that, but it's not true.  Wait, Louie, who was playing you that day?  Lucky Louie then.  What?  Oh, shit.  Oh, well, you know, it was flaccid and it was afraid of the camera.  But when it started, it's nice.  It's racist against black pussy guys.  I can't help it.  It's not something I have a control over.  A nice shave.  It's something I have any control over.  A nice shave.  But I'm going to be quite honest to you.  This is, I'm, I only like mixed something. 
[03:42:00]  I don't like a full-blooded nothing anymore.  Right.  I know what you mean.  I'm full-blooded anybody.  Your girl doesn't look full black.  My girl's half something.  Yeah.  I'm attracted to half something.  Exactly.  Half something.  Half something.  A full Asian does nothing, full white women.  It's just I enjoy a mixture.  You need some conglomerated mongrel.  Yes, indeed.  I think it's what you grow up with.  Because I still, all my fantasies are still, were built when I was 10.  I'm still going on those.  Yeah.  You know, so fucking age-wise.  Blonde cheerleaders and older Jewish women. 
[03:42:30]  Still the two things I like the most.  Who else is racist against you?  You said you're racist against me.  No, not at all.  I am.  No, not at all.  But you can figure that.  Yeah, there's certain, like, I don't like, probably, like, Asian.  I don't like really, unless they're mixed with something.  They've got to be kind of, uh, Amerasian.  You know, something like that.  I've met, I've met black women, I've met black women that I have, that I've flirted with  and that I've really gotten, like, a, like a crush on, but then I think about fucking  them and then my dick won't get hurt.  And I can't control that. 
[03:43:00]  What kind of fucking Nazi?  That's awful.  I know, I'm sorry.  Like, oh.  Like, as far as black chick goes, maybe, maybe Francine.  I'm talking pussy.  Yeah, maybe Francine.  Not dating, not loving.  I'm talking about pussy, too.  I'm talking about pussy, too.  But she's crazy.  She's got to cave her head in with a hammer when you're done.  I'm ashamed.  I'm ashamed of my dick.  There's no ethnic group that you go, I've jerked off, you don't jerk off to black porn?  No.  What?  I've never looked at black porn.  You're a piece of shit.  Inadvertently, I've looked, inadvertently, I've looked at black porn and gone like, her 
[03:43:30]  father must be so fucking upset.  Jesus.  You're talking about white, we're talking about a white girl with a black eye.  Two hands full of mouth and ass.  What are you?  We're not talking about black dick.  We're talking about black pussy.  Yeah.  You're missing a lot.  Like.  No, when I'm stumbling, when I'm like looking through porn.  Like a chick like that, a black chick?  I'm not into like dark black chicks.  I wouldn't be.  What are you looking at fan at right now?  Fan.  I don't know.  They figured we're doing all the heavy lifting today.  Hey fan.  We need you.  Come on.  When I look, when I'm looking at porn and I see. 
[03:44:00]  Brown and round.  Brown and round.  You're going to show me shit that might as well be two girls, one cup.  Dude, we did brown and round last time, didn't we?  No.  No, we did fat fucking.  We did mysweetfattie.com.  A whole other story.  My sweet fatty.  Today it's brown and round.  When I'm surfing porn.  It's brown and brown.  I agree.  Right there, you wouldn't stick your fucking dick in that.  What the fuck?  No.  Are you fucking kidding me, man?  No. 
[03:44:30]  Now, here's the thing.  I mean, I have been jerked off by black hookers.  Oh, God damn.  What the fuck is that?  I closed my eyes and thought about white people.  See, she's pretty light.  Yeah, she's not black.  Is that a weave?  Are all of you fucking the same way?  These women are.  I'm with you, Patrice.  That's kind of light.  Oh, see, what's that?  Look at that, right?  Oh, look at that giant, pretty.  Pretty giant asshole.  I don't want a giant, pretty giant asshole.  Just that beautiful little asshole on that giant ass with the pink twat. 
[03:45:00]  Are you not well?  Yeah.  Don't be that racist.  I know.  Wow.  See, we're different as people.  I don't think there's any points.  It's like, if you went to hairymongolianbitches.com.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Yeah, but that.  Oh.  Look at that.  Are you fucking joking?  That's a little scary now there.  That is.  Patrice, you just lost to rub an oil.  Oily asshole?  That's scary?  That's just how it moves.  You're losing me now.  What is that?  You're losing me.  It's a giant, oily asshole.  That's intimidating right there, man. 
[03:45:30]  It looks like a fucking CAT scan of a heart.  They are moving that ass.  It looks like it's going to eat your water.  It looks like it's going to eat your dinner or something.  Feed me.  Do you know how fucking fast my face would be?  Fuck.  That was like a high cholesterol.  Patrice, I was with you, but this is scaring me.  This is way too much.  That's scaring you?  There's too much extra meat on the ass.  That's scary?  All you motherfuckers are gay.  No. 
[03:46:00]  Those big fat.  That's scary.  A fat black ass ain't doing it for me.  That's scary.  It looks like a centipede's mouth saying, hello, hello, hello, hello.  Like a muppet.  Skinny white bitches don't do anything for me.  Meaning, I don't look at them and go, oh, but I'll fuck one.  And I'll do the same thing to a skinny white bitch that I would do to this bitch right here.  No, I need to be fucking visually excited.  I would say the same thing.  I could certainly work up a boner and fuck one of these girls, but I wouldn't. 
[03:46:30]  Really?  As a favorite of them?  Sure.  Sure.  I'll throw it.  I'll throw it.  Totally.  Here you go, nigglet.  I'm going to try.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Oh my goodness.  Have a good time.  Have a nice day.  I'm white.  That's hilarious.  But when I see them, I don't get hurt.  Wait, what about that one?  That one's all right.  What?  All the way up into the right?  She's white.  White chicks.  No, the second one down, there's something else in there. 
[03:47:00]  That's white.  These are white chicks.  I was looking for...  Now we're just looking at porno.  Now that to me, this is porno.  I was reprimanded for not looking at porno fast enough, so I'm just trying to be ahead  of it.  Before, I didn't consider that porno.  I don't know what that was.  Exploitedblackteens.com  This is like precedent cases in a courtroom.  Yes.  Your Honor.  I cite the case of exploitedblackteens.com.  Let's bring it up, please. 
[03:47:30]  Let's submit it.  What the fuck?  The defense calls exploitedblackteens.com.  Are you sure we got it right?  This looks like one of those general bullshit says.  Okay.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  Warning.  Let's see.  You're about to see pussy.  Now this might have something to add.  Okay, now you add the young and fragile and they get interesting.  It's true.  She's ugly, though.  Yeah, she's a little fucking...  No, she's not.  She's all right.  I like her.  With the jizz across the face.  This racism bothers me. 
[03:48:00]  No, this isn't racism.  This is pure...  Sean Bell doesn't bother me as much.  Wow.  Jesus Christ, that guy is laying some silly string.  Holy shit.  What was that, a home invasion?  What the hell is that?  She looks like Brandy.  That chick looked like Brandy a little bit.  Come on, dude.  Look at this girl.  She's not bad.  She looks like the daughter in the first Lethal Weapon.  I found her kind of cute.  Yeah, she was cute.  I changed it from giant, greasy black booties moving...  Which shows you that it ain't the color of the skin.  It's the content of the ass.  It is the color of the skin. 
[03:48:30]  If I could quote Martin Luther King...  Yeah, because these are all right.  Look at this girl right here.  Are you fucking joking?  No, this girl's...  All right, that ain't bad either, right?  No, these girls are all sex.  She looks like that Raven Simone fucking chick.  So does she.  So does she.  So does she.  So does she.  So does she.  Wait a minute.  Go back.  Go back one.  The one with the sweat sock.  The sweat sock.  Sweat sock.  Yeah.  That's really sexy.  A very dark black girl with like tube socks from the 70s.  Yeah, with the AVA socks.  All right.  She's pretty dark. 
[03:49:00]  Look.  Look.  She's very dark.  That's it.  I'll give it to you, Patrice.  You know, she's really pretty.  And Jemima wig on.  That's right.  Jesus Christ.  That's right.  She's got the Boston Celtics.  Yeah, that's the thing.  She has to be in contact.  She looks like a white chick that's really tan.  That's what it is.  And that's fine by me.  You don't fucking make me sick.  I don't like the big fat asses.  These motherfuckers make me really sick, man.  It has nothing to do with race.  We're proving it has nothing to do with race.  You're not.  Do you?  Yes.  Do you realize saying, oh, long as the little nigglet has long socks on and a police hat. 
[03:49:30]  I'll fuck it.  I can't.  No, that looks good.  Look, I'll cop to it that it's racist.  I can't help it.  How is it?  I'm not going to cop to being racist on this.  But why?  Why?  I'm sexually.  I am.  I can't help it.  I can't help that I don't get a boner from certain people.  And you know what?  You have access.  Oh, my God.  That looks like Urkel.  That looks like fucking Urkel with tits.  I'm also prejudiced against bad people.  Look at fucking Urkel taking a load on the face.  Did you just fucking call her Urkel?  Look at her taking a load on the face.  That's Urkel.  That is the sexiest thing I've seen all year. 
[03:50:00]  That pretty girl.  That's Urkel.  She looks a little manly, Patrice.  She got a mustache.  She looks manly with those little deer eyes looking up at cum.  Deer eyes.  Deer eyes.  There's a lot of eyebrows there.  And those tits ain't doing me justice.  Oh, fuck you.  What?  I'm just done with you.  The nipples look like the flying saucers from Mars Attacks.  See, they're not witch anymore because they know this is too racist.  One joke bombed.  Fuck you.  They're with me.  Not the bombing.  Your racism is just too much. 
[03:50:30]  How come I liked the black chick?  I fucking liked that.  I didn't like the fat ass.  You didn't.  I liked the black chick.  You put him in context.  And I want you to explain your racism to why.  I don't know why.  I mean, I just don't get hard.  Blacks on blondes.  Yeah, this is really going to fucking make me happy.  This is a Steve C. suggestion.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah, this is great.  But she's not blonde.  What went wrong?  Yeah, the other.  This should be called, I wanted my father to shoot himself. 
[03:51:00]  Well, no joke.  The other link he sent me was daddysworstnightmare.com.  Oh, get out of here.  Really?  Yeah, let me go to it.  Fucking Steve.  Yes, daddy's worst nightmare.  Get Steve in here.  Steve is the expert.  It's either another site like this or him bringing girls home.  It's the same, though, as like a black.  I don't get turned on by fat women.  Right, so why would it be white or fat?  You can put white fat asses up there.  I ain't going to fucking like it either.  It's a sexual aesthetic thing. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, God.  Ladies and gentlemen, the expert on porn.  Yes.  Steve.  Steve, sir.  Hold on a second.  Try my daddy.  My daughter's banging blackzilla.com.  A whole sentence website.  Yeah, this guy, Blackzilla, just his helmet is eight inches, I think.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Ah, shit.  Maybe that's not it.  Hold on.  Oh, damn.  Google, Google that sentence.  Wait, you know Blackzilla?  Patrice.  I know what he, I know his work.  He's packing. 
[03:52:00]  He knows his, it's not hard to figure out.  I don't think he breathes fire.  He knows his specs.  Yeah.  He knows his specs.  I know he, I know he, I know I'm familiar with his, with his, you know.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  All right, we're getting Blackzilla on the screen.  Here we go.  One of them.  I want to see, uh, oh, that's one of those fucking slants.  Ah, shit.  If I'm what, if I'm sorry.  Oh, come on.  I sent you two good ones.  Thanks for nothing.  Oh.  Oh.  See, I told you.  Holy mother of, oh, God damn. 
[03:52:30]  What the fuck?  That looks like a mugging.  Is that why you carry a gun?  That's it.  Just in case fucking Blackzilla comes in.  He could.  And bangs on your door with his cock.  He doesn't have to.  He could just take his cock and use it like No Country for Old Men.  That fucking thing.  And just bang the lock out of your door.  With his dick.  As he fucking, he's fucking into a pussy goes, hey, friendo.  Holy shit.  Oh, get out of here.  Oh, that's like that horse cock that killed that gay guy. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  That's the only thing we got out of slavery.  It's porn.  Porn.  Porn in our reparations.  Yeah, see?  That's not right.  Wow.  Look at her face.  She's sucking on that cock.  It's like sideways in her mouth.  Her face is just, it's a horrified look.  Okay, terrific.  I would say that's another way that I'm, I mean, if I'm surfing porn.  Another racist thing?  Yeah, another racist thing about me.  Is to see a black cock in a white woman? 
[03:53:30]  Is that if I see, if I'm surfing porn and there's a big black cock, to me it's like stumbling  on gay porn.  I'm like, oh, well, just keep moving.  I know.  Just keep moving.  But if you see a white cock, you think there might be some chicks involved, so it's okay  to look at it.  I have no problem watching a white guy fuck a black girl in porn.  You motherfuckers are awful.  Just awful.  Pussy should be the thing that crosses all boundaries, that bring us all together. 
[03:54:00]  Bring us all together?  I know.  Like, I have a dream?  There's no, there's no conversation that a guy, guys should go, here's the conversation,  it's like, my friend will go, hey, look at this chick, and I go, ah, her head's kind  of big, da-da-da.  He goes, would you fuck her?  I go, that has nothing to do with it.  No.  But that's what the conversation should be when it comes to pussy, like, oh yeah, black  girls don't turn me on, but I'll fuck the shit out of them.  That has more to do with your sexual fucking obsession.  I will fuck them.  It's just that they're not the thing that gets my dick on right away.  I'll go with that.  That's all.  If there were no other women left on the face of the earth, and I needed to fucking come. 
[03:54:30]  There was no other women.  By the way.  They just needed something, a dumpster.  Right, just to, like, dump a load in.  I'd be happy.  They're just above a cup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what kind of cup?  There are cups.  Fake china.  There are cups that are nicer, is what you're saying.  There's some pretty cups out there.  Beautiful cups.  There's some cups out there that are, there's, like, black women.  There's, like, some kind of cups, black women, other kind of cups.  Like, that's the way the, certain kind of cups. 
[03:55:00]  You know, I don't think we've done, like, I don't think we've done much today to bring  the races together.  No.  I don't think my birthday is really bringing the races together.  Usually me and Patrice will have discussions, and I think at the end of the day, it kind  of helps bring us, give us a more mutual understanding of each other.  I think we've gone a couple of steps back today.  Well, the pussy thing bothers me.  That really bothers me.  Because that is just something.  Don't you understand it has more to do with your sexual obsession than it does us not  liking certain types of women sexually? 
[03:55:30]  You'll fuck anything.  That doesn't, you transcend race because you'll fuck anything.  Well, I'll fuck anything.  Most guys will fuck anything.  I'll fuck anything, too.  That's absolutely true.  Under certain circumstances.  He will at the drop of a hat.  When you say anything.  That's why he bought a hat, so he could drop it and fuck something.  Fuck people.  Not anything is the problem.  Like, some guys might not fuck a certain level.  Like, they won't go into a nine or some shit.  But we're talking, we're not talking, like, ugly and this and that. 
[03:56:00]  We're talking racially.  Yeah.  You have problems getting horny with a black 10.  I found those black, skinny chicks attractive.  Okay.  Definitely.  But listen to how you're saying it.  Brown and round were not black 10s.  Brown and round.  Those are not black 10s.  No, I won't be tentative then.  Those are black 10s.  I'll say they were hot.  Well, in Europe, see, everybody's got a different scale.  Those are black 10s.  Black 10s, those fucking fat ass ones?  And the black community.  Oh, my God.  They are covered.  Just like white guys covet tall, skinny white women. 
[03:56:30]  I don't.  They do nothing for me.  I will fuck one because they exist.  Okay, but so that's exactly the same then.  That's exactly the same.  The only thing you won't fuck then is, like, a Yeti.  So you're admitting to the same prejudice as us then.  Yeah.  No.  That the women that you think white people hold in the highest esteem, the tall boys.  That is not the same as you.  You just said they don't do anything for you.  But you don't go like this.  But you'll fuck them.  But listen, if I go, look, skinny white bitches, especially ones like that have the bone in 
[03:57:00]  the pelvis, like you can see the pelvic bone.  Yeah.  That bothers me.  But you go, she has a pussy and you know she looks good to something else or someone  else.  It's like, hey, you know, white guys love this.  Not my thing.  Bend over, bitch.  Right.  It's like, look at those black, greasy asses.  Nah, it doesn't know for me.  But you know what?  Black, greasy ass.  Here we go.  Pussy is the ultimate denominator out of all of it.  And I can't believe you don't yucky.  Yeah, but you have your preferences.  Don't you have to find something aesthetically pleasing when you're fucking it? 
[03:57:30]  Do you want to look down at some fucking ass and go like, aesthetically pleasing to  you?  To everybody.  A big, giant, greasy ass.  That's why black chicks, big, fat black chicks walk around like, I look good, motherfucker.  I look good.  And I sit there and I look and go, why the fuck is she saying she looks good?  It's because of Patrice thinks she looks good.  What?  What are you looking for?  Fat ass white girls.  He's trying to figure it out.  Fat ass what?  White girls or something? 
[03:58:00]  Oh, he'll get it.  Start with fat ass, fan.  Sure.  Something will come up.  Well, it's fucking E-Rock's website.  Danny's got one.  Danny, what do you got?  Thank you, Travis.  You need to be going to assparade.com.  Ass parade.  Ass parade.  Ass parade.  All right.  All righty.  I'm only saying the same thing you're saying about skinny white girls, that these girls  with the big black asses, they're not my preference, but I would fuck all of them.  Let me say, that's great.  She has a big ass.  That's the same ass that you went ill to, except for fucking on a negative picture. 
[03:58:30]  It's the negative version of that black ass.  Keep going.  Let me see something else.  It's the same ass.  Look at that shit.  It's the same exact ass.  I do prefer a big white ass to a big black ass.  You a motherfucker, man.  Yeah.  That's the same shit Hitler probably said.  Yeah, I gotta say.  I gotta say, you're right.  I think I do prefer a bigger white ass to a big black ass.  Oh, see the girl with the bunny ears and the big ass?  Yeah. 
[03:59:00]  That's awesome.  I love that.  Are you fucking joking?  I would never disrespect it.  That ain't bad for a fat ass.  I would never disrespect madness by going yucky to that.  Love that.  That's the same ass that fucking on a girl.  Love all that.  I know, but they're white.  Are you fucking joking me?  Yeah, but they're white.  But they're white.  He's telling you, yes, but they're white.  They're white.  Look, white.  White ass.  Blonde hair.  Look at these fucking assholes.  These are good.  They're good.  That fucking crap girls was on the fucking screen.  They're white.  They're like, oh, oh, look at these deliciousness. 
[03:59:30]  Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.  Those chains are made of tinsel steel.  Yeah, you've got to sit back down, Patrice.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Oh, that is beautiful.  But you know what?  You make a great point.  It really is the same ass.  And all of a sudden, Danny's in the ass.  Lord and Jesus. 
[04:00:00]  He's revered right up in the mouth when the white giant asses are hanging all over the  place.  Black, greasy asses.  But they're not the same ass.  I had no problem with round and brown.  All right.  Danny's got no problem with round and brown.  No problem.  What was it when the fucking black, greasy asses were in the room?  These asses couldn't be.  You come running here like fucking Steve Austin's ass parade.  You didn't say brown and brown, motherfucker.  Give me another black sight, Mr. Light Giant Asses of All Colors.  Yeah, there you go.  Scratch your face, you fucking asshole.  Patrice, I'm going to agree with you now. 
[04:00:30]  Because I said I wasn't being racist about it.  You proved that you were right.  You were being racist.  You're right.  Look, I started this by saying that I'm sexually racist.  And I'll stick to it.  Hold on.  Because these girls.  Steve's got another one.  Yes.  Young boys.  That is just for my own pleasure.  Yes, exactly.  I don't know why I had to bother.  Since you're popping up websites.  Yes.  GhettoGaggers.com.  GhettoGaggers.  GhettoGaggers is the only site I've ever used my credit card.  Wow.  Oh, the illusory. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That looks like that fucking scene out of American History X when they invaded the store.  She's being baptized.  Look at that.  Not that one.  Not that one.  There was an accident at the glue factory.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  That's so weird.  Oh, my God, man.  Oh, you get videos?  All right.  Here's a sample.  This is the only site you used your credit cards for.  This is the only site I've ever had to buy.  GhettoGaggers.  Here we go.  GhettoGaggers.  Well, he's doing some dental work on her, apparently. 
[04:01:30]  All right.  Well, yeah.  Oh, wow.  I fucking hate that.  Holy shit.  Oh, she puked all over.  Now we found something Louie doesn't like.  Look at that shit.  Yeah, that thing is moving.  Are you joking me?  Are you joking?  You want to fuck that and feel good about it?  She didn't look bad.  She looked bad.  The ass is fat.  She didn't look like she was rolling.  It wasn't a fat ass.  She's actually got a very beautiful face.  I can find black women very beautiful.  It's just that I don't get the same boner.  I just don't.  Those are local chicks, too. 
[04:02:00]  You know what?  But beautiful is different.  You should always add those things.  We got another sample.  We got another sample coming up.  Here we go.  Those things.  Those things.  I find those things attractive.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  All right.  That is something.  Goddamn.  You know what she looks like there?  She looks like the fucking robot guy in Alien when his head came off.  Oh, yeah.  And all that milk started coming off.  You see how it died down, ghetto gaggers. 
[04:02:30]  But, you know, the white ones.  As soon as they...  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah.  Totally.  You're right.  There is a racism that goes on.  Yeah, but there couldn't be...  White fat ass.  It's just awful.  Awful, awful.  It's not the same ass.  It's the opposite ass.  Yeah, it is.  It's a white ass instead of a black one.  You couldn't be more different.  So you don't like the color.  How can anybody not like the beautiful caramel color?  I don't know.  Ask my dick.  I have no idea.  Don't you eat coffee ice cream?  I don't know what's going on.  You hate that, don't you?  Close your eyes.  We eat coffee ice cream.  Just go...  Barely touch it with your tongue.  We're almost at the end of Anthony's birthday show, but we do have a surprise for you. 
[04:03:00]  Really?  Yeah.  This is the best way to end your show.  I'm thinking.  Okay.  And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time once again for What's Up, Eastside David's Boss!  Oh, fun!  I get the camera.  Eastside David has stuck an object up his ass, and Opie and Anthony have to figure out what it is.  It's What's Up, Eastside David's Boss!  There he comes, Eastside David, everyone! 
[04:03:30]  Where's Dan?  Hold on, hold on.  What?  What's the big deal?  Oh, I don't like the message for harassment.  Don't push...  Run over.  Don't put your ass in the listeners' faces.  Oh, jeez.  Eastside David is naked.  Why do you have a shirt still on?  What matters at this point?  Why does he cup his dick in balls?  All right, fine!  Oh, God.  You asked for it, Louie!  Oh, God.  Dude, you have nothing today.  What's going on down there?  Oh, God.  It's very hot out.  You're hung like a hot out. 
[04:04:00]  It's supposed to be when it's cold out, dummy.  I get my temperatures confused.  Look at how small he is.  This is a very special what's in my ass today.  All right, because...  Very special because of my birthday?  Because it's Professor Anthony's birthday.  Yeah.  All right.  And I probably just gave a lot out with that little clue.  All right, listen.  And Patrice and Louie, the game is simple.  Dave definitely has something up his ass.  Oh, God.  And I guess they could see part of it or something. 
[04:04:30]  He's jerking himself off right now.  Well, Opie said I was small.  I just want to get a little bit of stuff in there.  He's jerking himself off in front of people.  Oh, what'd you say?  You're like a fucking orangutan.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm just trying to get some size.  Opie said I was small.  What's the big deal?  He's like a grown-up, retarded guy.  He is.  Like jacks off in front of people.  He's the retarded guy that got older than they thought he was going to get.  He was supposed to die earlier.  Yeah, and he fucking works in a box factory.  Stop jacking off.  He's trying to give... 
[04:05:00]  I'm just trying to give a little size, Louie.  What's the big deal?  I saw your cock on television.  I didn't jerk off.  Maybe you should have.  Yeah, I know.  All right, so we have to guess what's up beside Dave's ass.  Okay.  We start with the questions.  Eastside Dave.  Yes.  Is it plastic?  I think it is, yes.  Okay.  It's plastic?  I think.  Materials are not my strong suit, though.  Okay.  So I get to ask another question.  Yeah. 
[04:05:30]  Do you personally carry it every day?  No.  Okay.  I wouldn't do that.  Every day is not a special day.  Is it something you break out for birthdays?  It sure is, Opie.  Oh, okay.  Birthdays.  I already know what it is.  All right.  You can ask another question.  No.  If it's a candle, I have to punch in the face.  It's not a candle.  All right, good.  Oh, it's not a candle.  It traces to you.  I think it's a balloon.  He just makes everything taste nasty.  Like, I can't even drink.  That's so true.  Like, food becomes inedible. 
[04:06:00]  Drink becomes undrinkable.  Water is supposed to help you not be nauseous.  But he's just...  Yeah, I have to totally disagree with that.  It's a balloon.  Is it a balloon?  Oh, my God.  It's not just a balloon.  It's a happy birthday balloon.  Just for Anthony.  Oh, my God.  And everyone loves to blow up balloons, don't they?  Oh, my God.  Everyone loves to blow up balloons.  Ryan says, dude, to three.  Ryan says, dude, to three.  Oh, he's throwing up. 
[04:06:30]  Oh, he put the balloon in his mouth.  It's been in his ass.  Ryan says, dude, to three.  Give him the pail.  Get him the pail.  He's going to puke.  He's going to puke.  Oh, shit.  Blow up that balloon.  Blow up that balloon.  Oh, shit.  Louie's making the make it go away face.  Goddamn, Dave.  All right.  Thank you.  I guess this game's over.  Dave, thank you so much for a special birthday. 
[04:07:00]  What's up, Dave's ass?  Thank you very much.  Wait, what about your haircut?  I gave you a card, too, but I don't know where that card is.  I gave it to Travis.  Look at his hair.  He was in Afro Wars.  We shaved his head, and he refuses to.  Oh, what's wrong with this guy?  I don't know.  I'm still in Afro Wars.  Aren't I, gang?  Oh, God.  That's the worst ass I've ever seen in my life on Man Norbeast.  All right.  See you, guys.  He, uh, oh, my God, damn.  What is wrong with him? 
[04:07:30]  He's gaping his ass as he runs out of the studio.  There is something so wrong with him, man.  We got the outro.  We got to make it official.  Some contestants will take on the home version of What's Up, Eastside, Dave's Butt.  Commotional consideration given to anybody who gives a fuck.  What's Up, Eastside, Dave's Butt is copyright 2008 Obie Hanzi Productions.  We'll see you next time when we play What's Up, Eastside, Dave's Butt.  What's Up, Eastside, Dave's Butt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was, you know.  Lou, you all right?  I hate that guy.  You're right. 
[04:08:00]  I hate him.  I hate him.  I recognize his value to this show.  And I understand he's funny, but I can't take it.  I can't take it.  He's just like a circus clown on our show.  He actually does.  It's so gross.  He actually does, like, real good radio for Ronnie and Fez, but.  Oh, I know.  I totally get that.  But for us, he's just a circus boy, really.  The thing is that he kind of has the same, like, coloring as me, and that's what bothers  me, I think.  He looks like he could be related.  It's like if I was doing that.  Yeah.  Right.  Oh, so you're kind of thinking, like, yeah.  You're kind of so you're thinking. 
[04:08:30]  He's fucking up our people, you know.  Yeah, the redheads.  Yeah.  You remind me of me a lot when I was a kid.  Yeah.  Kid.  Except for the nudity and jerking off and thing up your ass.  Patrice.  Silent again.  Patrice gets silent.  Patrice can't.  Yeah.  Doesn't like being party to that.  Yeah.  Because white guys just don't do that, right?  No.  I mean, look, man.  I'm not fucking super.  That's a white guy, I think.  Norton does homo shit, but it's, you know, it's.  But he's.  And it's real. 
[04:09:00]  That's what.  When I say.  It's not.  He's not a publicity stunt guy.  No.  He's a fucking sociopath.  And he puts his hand in his ass and grabs shit.  And it just.  And licks his fingers clean.  And then he gets sick.  And then pukes.  Yeah.  You would have to kill him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He'll do anything.  Yeah, you would have to kill him.  He will do anything.  Which is it.  It's like really.  And it's legitimate.  I mean, I guess that's what you say.  The value is that the motherfuckers legitimately.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, he comes in here with a.  He's not a phony.  No.  He didn't even put the easier kind of balloon. 
[04:09:30]  That balloon.  Yeah, he took the Mylar balloon.  It was a little Mylar balloon.  It's made out of crinkly.  A little bit of foil.  Yeah.  That's the shit they covered the Luna module in.  So, you know, there was some type of sharp edge.  Yeah, yeah.  And he stuffed that in his fucking asshole.  He did.  Any fucking heroin mule could put a regular balloon up their ass.  Try it with Mylar, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Those edges get sharp.  And so you respect that a little bit.  It's not a respect thing.  Oh, it isn't?  It's I watch him and I go, you know, it's like the white boys, them jackass white boys, 
[04:10:00]  man.  Yeah, yeah.  I go, they scare me.  Because those fuckers are legitimately, they have a problem.  Crazy.  They're fucking not well, dude.  You know, this movie I'm doing, when they ask me to shave and when they do my hair, they  stick it way out and I dress in a disgusting wife beater and sweatpants.  Yeah.  And I'm playing a real, like a really disgusting loser.  That's my role in the movie.  And once they did my whole thing, I looked in the mirror, I'm like, I'm Eastside Dave. 
[04:10:30]  That's what I am.  I'm playing Eastside Dave.  In a movie.  And he's actually informed the character I'm playing in the movie.  Like, I think about him.  That's helping.  I get a little sick.  And then I do it.  You're researching your part.  Yeah.  What movie did I just see you in?  Roscoe Jenkins, that Martin Lawrence movie.  I'm in that for, yeah, like one scene.  All right.  I don't think that was it, though.  I'm in a Matthew Broderick movie, too, but that's not out yet.  Was you in the boxing movie with, uh...  No.  Your boy?  No. 
[04:11:00]  With the voice?  Sound like Edward G. Robinson.  All white boys sound like Edward G. Robinson.  All the smarmy white boys.  Nah, same.  Corolla.  I'm not in any movie with him.  Okay.  All right.  Sorry.  From Eastside Dave.  I forgot to be touching it.  I forgot to give you the birthday card.  Why would I touch that?  It was free ass.  It was free.  I'm not...  I want an official...  You can't even fucking rely on that information.  I want an official opener.  He sticks everything in his ass.  I can't even fucking use anything.  You know what?  Throw acid on it. 
[04:11:30]  Ha ha ha ha.  Now you got E. coli.  And this is my pretty...  My poetry.  Oh, poetry.  And then it's scribbled out a whole line.  I like calling you when I'm drunky, Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Happy birthday, Dave.  All right.  Now you can throw it away.  You made it rhyme.  How do you touch that?  Like, I can't touch that.  Hey, I think it's time for line of the day.  Yes.  How many...  Five runner-ups? 
[04:12:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  We got a sponsor there, Louie, AshleyMadison.com.  What's that?  That's if you want to cheat.  If you're a guy and you're married, or a woman and you're married, and you want to cheat,  you go to AshleyMadison.com and you hook up with each other.  Oh.  And you both want discreetness.  But through a website where there's a record?  Well, you got to watch what you're doing.  Yeah.  But that's because you both want to be discreet.  I see.  So you do that and you fuck each other.  And then...  Isn't it easy to just rape and kill? 
[04:12:30]  You kill...  Yeah, that's what I was saying.  Then you kill the woman.  The husband gets blamed for it.  And then you just find another chick.  That's a great website.  I'm teasing, of course.  AshleyMadison.com is a wonderful website.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Times are tough, advertising-wise.  Oh, don't worry.  So let's embrace the sponsor.  It's safe and sound and people are getting...  So that's a real sponsor.  People are getting late.  It's really like a website that helps you cheat on your loved one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're not doing...  And they're buying advertising time.  Yeah, we're not doing an SNL skit here.  This is like the real deal.  You go there and there are women and men that want to cheat on their loved ones. 
[04:13:00]  Look at their logo.  Well.  And see, the chick's going, shh.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You'll never see lips that are this nice on this website.  No, there are beautiful women on there.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, hell yeah.  Oh.  What?  White ones?  Say they're a fucking beautiful sponsor.  Motherfucker.  Just white women are on it.  That's it.  No.  Women of all nationalities.  That's right.  Well, black people don't cheat on their wives.  No, never.  Black guys don't cheat on their wives.  Never.  We try our best to fuck everybody at the same time. 
[04:13:30]  White guys either cheat on your wives or kill them.  Hey, dude, turn up in the strangest places.  Either dump them in the river or cheat on them.  Or the dump.  The dump seems to be a good place to put them.  Or kill them because you fall in love with the girl you're cheating on.  Cheating with.  Yeah.  It's always on.  It's on A&E all the time.  Bill Curtis will tell you about it.  Bill Curtis.  It was 12.05 p.m. on the day of December 12th when we know how this is going to end.  Exactly.  This ain't going to be good.  Cold case file.  Let's get this started. 
[04:14:00]  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  He goes, why are you guys better than us?  He goes, I never forget.  This is not even paraphrasing.  Because you get sickle cell anemia and we don't.  What?  Jesus.  That's who versus.  That's who versus Frederick Douglass.  Because y'all get.  Frederick Douglass.  Because y'all get sickle cell anemia and we don't.  Frederick Douglass was the fucking line.  Yeah.  That was sweet.  Well, let me debate you on this. 
[04:14:30]  Motherfucker.  Yeah.  Boy.  Another runner-up line of the day.  We started with Wesley Snipe.  Who the hell knows where you go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and  Right.  I got to leave bread trails behind you to make my back to the beginning of where we were.  Look at this chick right here.  How can you not want to fuck her?  Are you digging her?  She's eight.  She's fine.  She's eight.  Look at her.  Web videos of the week.  This could be you, Patrice.  Here's another runner-up line of the day. 
[04:15:00]  He'll watch the bathroom door for us, Ronnie, while we put a few out on the back of the  toilet.  Well, like the old Chuck E. Cheese days, we know cops ain't going to be hanging out there.  Damn, Ronnie.  Rana Fez, noon to three.  Yes.  Tune in.  Right to the next one.  City Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch, his last name.  Just a horrible twist of fate on that joke. 
[04:15:30]  Illuminati, right?  Illuminati.  You got to blame it on the Illuminati.  It all goes back to that, right, Patrice?  Right after him, Darren Henga-Nigger.  Oh, my God.  Patrice is going to be at Giggles next weekend in Seattle.  Jimmy did well out there.  There's a lot of fans out there, Patrice.  Seattle.  We'll see what happens.  Giggles next weekend.  Final runner-up.  One more runner-up.  It's security.  Just in case.  Somebody feels secure.  Makes me feel secure.  Neither thing is paranoia.  It's both true. 
[04:16:00]  It's white people run everything and black people steal.  Quite frankly, you should be adding that goddamn King Kong reference, which I have to give  you.  Oh, damn.  Fucking some type of credit for that.  There's one more.  Might be a little more patient.  Oh!  Oh, no, you know what?  I thought that was it.  When you said five.  Oh, you said five.  Oh, wow.  The big surprise.  Well, that's Patrice.  It's like he just went, it's a balloon.  Thank God. 
[04:16:30]  I wouldn't want to stretch that bit out any longer.  This is line of the day.  Here it is.  Here Jimmy makes an appearance, but the voiceover comes.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Look at these fucking assholes.  They're good.  They're good.  I thought the rap girls was on the fucking screen.  That was like, oh, oh, look at this deliciousness. 
[04:17:00]  Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.  Those chains that made of pencil steel.  What his birthday.  Thank you.  On my birthday.  Happy birthday.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Where's the bacon?  I smell bacon.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Gotta be bacon.  Only one thing smells like bacon, and that's bacon.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Bacon.  Bacon there.  Please.  Please.  Give me what's in the bag.  Chewy.  Yummy.  Smokey.  Bacon.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  It's bacon.

Thank you so much.  What a great day.  New Brunswick in June.  A lot of fun.  What?  I got New Brunswick in June.  That's all I got.  He was asking me for it.  Stress Factory or something?  No, I meant the state.  You sound like a fucking loser.  You're doing movies and shit.  I think the state theater in New Brunswick is June 27th.  Nice, nice.  Very good.  It was supposed to be this Friday, but we moved it because of the movie.  Yeah, see?  That's not like I moved it because, you know, some schmuck comic was coming in or no tickets. 
[04:18:00]  June 27th, whatever, state theater in New Brunswick.  Nick Carr should have got an honorable mention.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Saying even his black friends are racist.  That was a good one.  Or something like that.  That was amazing.  Yeah.  Thank you, everyone.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Have a great weekend.  Oh, you want to plug the big birthday celebration again?  Nah.  It's enough people coming.  I'm sure it's going to be.  You know what?  The place is going to be huge.  Where is it?  I mean, it's going to be packed.  Okay.  No, it's at Smith's.  No, where is it, though?  New York City. 
[04:18:30]  It's downtown.  What the fuck do you know?  It's an Irish bar, Patrice.  I was going to come visit.  I'm kidding.  Please come down there.  It's at Smith's.  It's downtown.  Where the fuck is it?  Anyone know?  43rd and 8th.  43rd and 8th?  Yeah, roughly.  What is it?  Woody's?  No.  Smith's.  Smith's?  Yeah.  43rd and 8th.  I think it does have like a red neon.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Okay.  You got to pay to get in?  I think it's 43rd.  Not you.  But it's pay.  You got to pay to get in?  Oh, I don't think so.  I don't know. 
[04:19:00]  I don't know any arrangements.  Keep the cops set the whole thing up.  He's going to be at the door?  Yeah.  I'm just asking because I don't, you know, I don't want to come down.  Don't you worry about it?  I don't want to mingle.  Yeah, you ain't going to fucking mingle.  I got to say hello to a bunch of fucking, you know, you know, look over there.  That's what you're going to have to be hanging out with, Patrice.  A bunch of guys who look like Bob Kelly.  Times 10.  Dude!  A bunch of fucking Bob Kellys.  Dude!  Don't want to do it.  Bob Kellys.  Poor Bobby.  Yeah.  We're out of here.  All right, man.  Thank you, everybody. 
[04:19:30]  You've been wonderful.  Danny looks like a Japanese animation character.  Yeah, why, Patrice?  He takes care of you.  Oh, shit.  And I love Danny.  All right.  We're out.  All right.  Goofy gags to plan your uncircumcised pals.  Funny things to do with foreskin.  One was you put fucking a little crazy glue around the rim, and you put it around an exhaust  pipe, the foreskin, and then you drive away.  Fucking pull the skin aside and dump rock salt in there.  Clean that out, you fucking baboon cock. 
[04:20:00]  One was itching powder in the fucking thing, and then you staple it.  Put it shut on top.  Dirty fucking European dick.  You stand a fucking uncut guy against the wall, and you lay on your back, you put your  feet on his thighs, and you grab his foreskin with both hands, and you pull it up to your  chest, and then let it snap like a window shade.  And it will actually make the noise.  I have to fill that skinny fucking fleshy pouch with crushed glass, and then fucking  smash my fist out.  Goofy gags to plan your uncircumcised pals.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[04:20:30]  Hit the bricks, crusader dick. </pre>
