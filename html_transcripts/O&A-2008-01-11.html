<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a discussion about the cancellation of a scheduled phone call with Donald Trump, blaming the interference of Larry Norton's radio show.  The hosts played and dissected a flawed promotional announcement for Trump's appearance,  debating the necessity of apologizing for the cancellation.  This segued into Anthony's upcoming Mohegan Sun gambling trip, detailing his strategy and a humorous anecdote about a fellow gambler intimidated by his chip stack. A listener called in to discuss this.  The hosts also spent time discussing a child who glued his hand to his bed to avoid school, embellishing the story with a "bleep game," and fielding calls to the show's "FU" line.  Comedian Patrice O'Neal and his friend Gavin visited the studio, contributing to discussions about race relations in America and the upcoming presidential election, alongside further listener calls.  Al Sharpton's reaction to a golf commentator's use of the word "lynch" was also discussed.

A substantial portion of the show focused on anti-smoking commercials, comparing graphic Canadian ads featuring diseased organs and a dead fetus to the milder warnings on American cigarette packs.  The hosts debated the effectiveness of different deterrents, including aesthetic consequences and impacts on sexual performance, and discussed the hypocrisy of the tobacco industry.  A specific ad featuring a legless man who continued to smoke was analyzed, leading to a broader conversation about addiction, with the hosts sharing their own experiences with food. Bobby recounted a hypoglycemic episode.  A listener called in regarding the legless smoker ad.  The show included plugs for comedians, promotion of the show's animated shorts on iTunes, and a discussion of Roger Clemens and alleged steroid use, using a distorted audio clip. This led to a conversation about proving guilt, veering into racially charged and offensive commentary.  Throughout this section,  Louis C.K., Patrice O'Neal, Bob Kelly, and Howie Mandel were in the studio, along with Basil Tees preparing breakfast.  A running joke involved a naked woman exercising in a nearby building, observed by Gavin with binoculars. Howie Mandel had a lengthy discussion about his bidet. A segment with Tippi Tom reading classic literature was played before a break.

The post-break segment centered on "Deal or No Deal," with the hosts and guests reacting to contestants' decisions, specifically those who rejected large sums of money.  Examples included a woman whose husband urged her to accept an offer from Fallujah, and a Korean-American contestant whose final offer matched his original case. The discussion included significant use of offensive language.  Dr. Phil's commentary on racism and cyberbullying on Xbox Live was debated, with the hosts referencing their own experiences playing Call of Duty 4, including their use of the offensive clan name "GAY."  Howie Mandel was mentioned as a guest, and there were more "F.U. Line" calls.  Patrice O'Neal, Bob Kelly, and Louis C.K. were mentioned as guests not present in studio. The show included the "Daily Dump Report" segment, highlighting jokes deemed inappropriate for broadcast.  The show ended with a discussion of Val Kilmer's music.

Later in the broadcast,  the hosts critiqued a poorly received television show, discussed Val Kilmer's perceived arrogance in trying to hang out with Chris Rock, and contrasted this with Chris Rock's modesty and one host's greed.  One host confessed his guilt over not giving his father a free Sony Vaio, leading to further offensive and racist jokes.  A graphic and sexually explicit account of a friend's sexual encounter was recounted in detail, followed by the hosts' reactions to the video "Two Girls, One Cup," which was described graphically.  Bob Kelly's vomiting audio was played, linking to a discussion of yeast infections and another graphic, sexually explicit, and offensive anecdote. Danny was a guest during this portion.  The language used throughout this section was extremely offensive, graphic, and racist.

The final segment involved viewing and reacting to a series of extremely graphic videos, including those depicting defecation, vomiting, extreme sexual acts, and graphic violence.  Gavin and Louie reacted with disgust and even vomiting, and Bob Kelly and another unnamed guest also left the studio.  The hostsâ€™ reactions ranged from laughter to revulsion, and the discussion included highly offensive language and speculation about the sexual orientations of individuals in the videos.  The show concluded with promotion of upcoming events, interspersed with further offensive jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to your socks?  I don't know what happened to you.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  He's doing it now.  His skin is completely black.  Oh my God.  This is where entertainment is going.  Oh my God.  Oh, Roland's got a paddle.  Oh my God. 
[00:01:00]  Roland is kicking Dave's ass.  Who saw this coming?  They are sick freaks.  One, two, three.  Go.  B-Rock is a 10th.  Oh my God.  Give us a thumbs up if you're alright.  Shut up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh my God.  It smells great in here today. 
[00:01:30]  What the hell's going on?  Basil teas cooking breakfast for the crew?  Mmm.  How good does that smell right now?  Really good.  See, you're just waking up.  We're smelling eggs with a little bacon.  Some fruity fruit.  There's some fruity fruit in the corner there.  Good morning, Steve from Bayshore. 
[00:02:00]  There's also some strawberries, Steve.  Yes.  Mmm.  Well, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Gotta stop eating now.  And for the three people that are keeping track, I'm still blowing my nose.  Three?  Well, I mean, there's a lot of people that listen to the show.  There's three people that care enough to know if I'm getting better or not. 
[00:02:30]  Know what the mucus count is?  How much snot is in one man's body?  Seriously.  It is amazing when you blow your nose and then just minutes, sometimes seconds later,  it's full again.  Like, how does it make it that fast?  Dump it into your schnoz.  I'm getting better, like 5% better every day.  5%?  So I got 25% better this week.  Basis.  I got 25% more to go. 
[00:03:00]  So that means Saturday and Sunday.  So around Tuesday of next week, I'll be 100%, I'm thinking.  Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Monday.  I feel much better, though.  It's been a hell week for me.  All right.  Our phone number, 877-212-O-N-A.  Cheesy.  You got onaradio.com.  That's starting to blow up a bit.  Thanks to Stephen S. from Bayshore and his rundown.  Also, you know, we throw all the visual stuff up there, I should say. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  If we talk about a video or a picture, bam, we throw it on onaradio.com.  It's one place to go to see all the stuff we talk about, okay?  Right.  And then you got the CokeLogic animations.  They get thrown up there.  What else?  What else is up there?  Oh, everything you need to know.  It's a smorgasbord of information and entertainment.  Yeah.  Well, we got a lot to do. 
[00:04:00]  I guess a few people care, so we should tell them.  Donald Trump was supposed to call our show yesterday.  Yeah.  And then I read an article that appeared in page six of the Post about how Donald pretty  much hated us, called us slobs, and he would never call our show ever again, won't be on  our show ever again.  But he was scheduled for yesterday.  Certainly was.  So I guess he either forgot or he didn't care anymore.  But I guess because we made a big to-do about it. 
[00:04:30]  A stink.  He blew us off yesterday.  And then there was communications going on after the show like crazy.  My BlackBerry was getting all sorts of emails.  And it turns out that another radio show, guess which one, blew up our spot.  And brought it to the Donald's attention that we read the Post article and reminded him  about the fact that, you know, he called us slobs. 
[00:05:00]  And who could it have been?  Well, the people from Donald Trump's people, or the people that scheduled Donald Trump on  radio shows and media and stuff, admitted that it was another radio show, but they won't  tell us which one.  Oh, thanks.  So use your imagination.  I don't think it was Scott and Todd.  No.  I don't think it was Man Town.  Somebody that probably has a relationship with Donald Trump, has over the years. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a show still effing with us.  Still.  And it's all behind the scenes, by the way.  Yeah.  Because that's how they do their bidding.  All behind the scenes.  Behind closed doors.  It's secret.  I wonder who it could be.  They just do it the wimpiest way possible.  Behind the scenes.  Closed doors.  You know, make sure you leave me out of this, but. 
[00:06:00]  That type of thing.  Do you think we need Donald Trump to do this show?  Well, then there's the biggest insult.  Where's Steve?  Maybe Steve could come in here.  Then there was an email that got to me late yesterday that said, if you guys were willing  to write a letter.  Write a letter, right?  What?  How pompous is this guy?  We don't need Donald Trump on our show.  It's fun when he calls in every once in a while, and we go at it a little bit, and we 
[00:06:30]  make fun of him, and he makes fun of us, and then we promote his dumb project.  I guess they wanted some kind of written acknowledgement of apology.  I'll write him four letters.  C.  U.  That's all.  I'll stop there.  You can guess what the other two are.  He wants us to apologize?  I guess.  For what?  For making a to-do about the page six thing.  What are you talking about? 
[00:07:00]  Seriously.  I swear, that's the cryptic email I got yesterday.  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  Stop it.  I get a lot of email.  Scroll.  I get much, I get the letter.  You know, we had a better show yesterday, because we didn't have Donald Trump on, because  the time we would have wasted talking to him yesterday, we ended up doing some cool  bit.  That's some fun.  I guess, you know, like a signed letter saying, let's just put this silliness behind  us.  Signed, OPNM.  Why doesn't he just come on the air, and we'll hash it out? 
[00:07:30]  Hash it out on the air.  That's what we do.  We hash it out on the air.  We don't go behind the scenes and have to write letters and take secret phone calls.  Also, a lot of this communication is done through intermediaries, so who knows exactly where  this is coming from.  We have to send a letter, like, begging him to come on after he called us slobs.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  Get out of here.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  We wouldn't do that for anybody.  Taking notes.  And that ain't happening. 
[00:08:00]  And it was another radio station, right?  It was another radio show.  We don't know which one.  We do know which one.  Okay.  Come on.  It was Snorton Norton.  Ooh.  That's unfortunate.  Going local for Buffalo.  Larry Norton blew up our spot.  What could it be?  I told Donald Trump that we were talking badly about him.  That's if his rep is telling the truth.  Whoever the rep is, maybe the one that heard the promo and told him himself.  It could be.  Again, that's right.  I mean, again, a lot of this communication happens through intermediaries.  Very rarely, you know, it's not like I was on the phone with Donald Trump and getting 
[00:08:30]  this communication directly.  There were, you know, stares of people.  I didn't realize you would be an intermediary, too.  Yes, I know.  Yeah.  But you did get an email.  I'm sorry.  It's not like I was on the phone with Donald Trump.  Well, I mean.  You mean an intermediary.  It would be like me or Opie being on the phone with Donald.  Poor analogy.  Or Jimmy.  That's early.  You can call me a slob.  That's true.  That's true.  The slob was directed at you guys.  Yeah, he kept Jimmy out of it.  Damn.  So you definitely got the email that it was another radio show, though, right? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Tom suggested it was the promo that we ran promoting the fact that Donald Trump.  I agreed with that.  Do we have that, E-Rock?  Yeah, why would we?  No.  We weren't going to talk about Donald Trump today, right?  Of course not.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  There were only a million emails going around yesterday.  Why would we have the promo ready?  Oh, we just gave a thumbs up.  You got it?  You got it?  Yeah.  All right.  This is how we were promoting Donald Trump's appearance.  We played this late in the show yesterday, but it's worth playing again just to get to the 
[00:09:30]  bottom of this whole thing.  Could have been a problem.  All right.  You listen to this and see if there is possibly a problem here.  E-Rock.  Hi, guys.  Hope you're in Anthony again.  Yesterday, we really screwed up and kind of didn't do this promo the right way.  No.  And because of that, Donald Trump blew us off.  E-Rock.  I think today is the day we fire E-Rock.  You have got to be the stupidest man in broadcasting.  That was the promo we did yesterday for today's show.  E-Rock, was that not your fault?  The cart that it was in has been replaced with yesterday's promo, so the one I had loaded 
[00:10:00]  from yesterday has been replaced.  So why wouldn't you check it before we get in here?  That's your job.  Oh, boy.  You know we were going to talk about Donald Trump today because the email was going around.  So why wouldn't you make sure you got the right promo loaded and ready to go?  Oh, you get one demerit.  Do you have the other one, though?  Let's take lemons and rub it into a wound. 
[00:10:30]  Yes.  God.  That was great.  I don't know.  There's something about that that just cracks me up.  What?  Like when, all right, here it is, and the button gets pushed, and it's completely wrong.  It really makes me laugh.  Especially when it's poor Eric.  I know.  You can see the panic.  He's like, oh.  It's like, I don't know.  It's, oh, jeez.  The man took it.  The man, Mr. Man. 
[00:11:00]  He becomes like a one-year-old.  The man took it away.  At this point, there's not enough cinnamon in the world for you to swallow.  Ooh.  He almost died.  You should swallow a whole ladle of cinnamon at this point.  That's right.  It's coming.  You rock.  You know we're live on the air, right?  So keep typing.  It's coming from Tim.  When you have a microphone in front of you.  But keep typing.  Because your typing is terrific.  You don't talk enough on air as far as I'm concerned anyway, you rock.  Your voice is like a siren song. 
[00:11:30]  A siren song.  Oh, my God.  Well, as we wait for this, because timing is everything in radio, so I'm sure it'll be  just as terrific when we finally get it.  I don't trust intermediaries.  It could have been the guy.  It probably was the other radio show.  But if it wasn't, it was that guy who didn't want to admit, yeah, I heard it and I told him  and he didn't like it.  Just get Donald Trump to call our show and see what happens.  There's going to be no letters if that's what he wanted. 
[00:12:00]  We hash it out.  Letter.  Maybe we work something out.  Maybe we don't.  The hell are we, businessmen?  We don't really need him for a good radio show.  It just makes for a good storyline and it's now interesting.  But besides that, who cares?  How about a fax?  A fax?  You want a fax?  One that rolls up and falls on the floor like the old days.  Yeah.  Like that stupid from the Tom Cruise movie?  Yeah.  Where it fell down and rolled underneath something.  Was that a Tom Cruise movie?  Yeah, with that dumb Walter Brimley looking for him? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Quaker Oats fruit.  Oh, the diabetes guy.  All right.  Liberty.  Liberty Medical Supplies can get your diabetes supplies.  All right.  Well, you know what?  The Firm, that was it.  Yeah, The Firm, which was a great book.  I don't remember if the movie was good.  Do you?  It was good, except it's the worst music ever put in a movie.  Is it?  For you to notice music is bad, it has to be horrendous.  Yeah.  Some movies are pretty good and the music just ruins it.  It's so dated.  That and Injustice for All are probably the two worst scored films ever. 
[00:13:00]  It's like, who did this?  Is it like a joke?  Is this the wrong movie they put?  Oh, well, here it comes.  Steve from Bayshore says that Jimmy is sweetly cruel to Iraq.  Yeah.  You're sweetly cruel to him.  I like it.  I like Iraq.  He knows that.  I get a weird view of him.  I just see his little hat.  Yeah.  And his glasses.  I throw things at him all day long.  I try to hit his hat. 
[00:13:30]  I just don't know what it is with him.  He's got a lot of potential, but he's, God, he's so frustrated.  He's in the room.  I know he's right there.  Who gives a crap?  He's sitting right there.  Well, now that the moment has passed, this is how we promoted Donald Trump's appearance.  Let's bring the moment right back.  On our show.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Opie and Anthony here.  I just want to let you know, tomorrow on the show, Donald Trump.  He said he would never call our show again. 
[00:14:00]  He didn't like us.  We are going to talk to Donald Trump tomorrow.  Why?  He needs promotion, obviously.  Oh, okay.  He's a whore.  All on the next Opie and Anthony show, 92.3 KROQ.  Okay.  That could have been a problem.  I say that shouldn't be a problem.  Um, shouldn't?  Yeah.  Donald Trump has a sense of humor.  Does he?  I think so.  When have you ever seen him displayed?  Yeah.  I've never seen him funny once.  Never funny.  I've liked things he said because he's a dick. 
[00:14:30]  I mean, you know, he's been brutal to people, which I kind of, he brutalized Rosie and some  other tough targets.  I mean, I kind of like that.  You think he's full of himself where that would get to him?  Just the idea like, oh, they think that I'm groveling.  Well, then I won't go on.  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  Is there any orange juice back there?  Orange juice?  Call it OJ, please.  There you go.  I'd like to have some of that.  Hey, I could use some OJ, too, there, Ken.  I'm having a real breakfast this morning.  Ooh, I see that.  Look at me.  Kenny ran in.  It was so awful.  All right.  This is what we're going to do. 
[00:15:00]  We're going to replay something just to start the show off.  It'll be new for a lot of people.  Thank you.  And then we're going to take a break, and then we're going to regroup and get into some  other things, including Cancer Guy.  No, he's not even Cancer Guy.  He's just, like, rotting away heart attack stroke guy.  Well, yeah, but he's missing a leg, too, so.  Yeah, but that was from Blood Clots.  Oh, okay.  Is this commercial only being played in New York?  I don't know.  All right.  Well, this is what we're going to do, then.  We get awful anti-smoking commercials here in New York City. 
[00:15:30]  Jesus Christ.  They really want everyone to stop smoking in New York, because the latest guy they're  using is just a horror show, and we'll put the commercial up on onaradio.com later today  so the rest of America can enjoy it, okay?  But first, there was a story of a kid that decided to stay home from school because he  enjoyed his Christmas holiday so much, and he glued his hand to the bed.  I could totally relate to this kid.  Yeah?  Who the hell wants to go back? 
[00:16:00]  You're on a Christmas vacation.  You don't want to go back to school.  Oh, that's exactly how I was, but I would say, I got a stomach ache, and I'd cry, and  Dad would yell at me, call me the F word for homosexual.  Why would you always use that word?  Well, because he didn't want his son to be a homosexual, and he would say, Roe, you're  turning him into a, you know.  Yeah.  I wish I could say it, but it's stupid. 
[00:16:30]  But we're not allowed to?  Yeah, I don't think we're allowed to.  No.  But, yeah, he would call me that because I was always crying.  Yeah.  And after vacations, it was the same thing, going back to school.  This kid took it to a whole new level there with the crazy glue.  Right.  Well, the story's good, but then we played the bleep game, and that's why we're replaying  this today.  Yes.  Here we go.  Here's the original story.  A boy in Mexico tried to skip school and got into a sticky situation, literally.  This 10-year-old snuck into the kitchen of his family's home early Monday, got industrial 
[00:17:00]  glue, slathered it on his right hand, and then grabbed the frame of his bed.  When the boy's mother woke up, she found him in his room watching TV with his hand on the  bed.  At first, she didn't think anything of it, but when she realized he was stuck, she spent  nearly two hours trying to get his hand free with water, oil, and nail polish remover.  Eventually, a team of paramedics were called in.  The boy says he pulled the stunt because he had so much fun on Christmas break, he didn't 
[00:17:30]  want to go back.  But it didn't work.  He was unglued in time for class.  The boy's hand is fine, and his mother describes her son as a good kid, but says he's mischievous  like all kids.  So there you go.  Kind of dumb, actually.  Simple story.  Simple story, and then the guys took it and played the bleep game with it to make it much  more interesting.  This is what Danny came up with.  A boy in Mexico tried to skip school and got into a sticky situation, literally. 
[00:18:00]  This 10-year-old snuck into the kitchen of his family's home early Monday, got industrial  glue, slathered it on his, then got the frame of his bed.  When the boy's mother woke up, she found him in his room watching TV with his on the bed.  At first, she didn't think anything of it, but when she realized he was stuck, she spent  nearly two hours trying to get his free with water, oil, and nail polish.  Eventually, a team of paramedics were called in.  The boy says he pulled the s*** because he had so much fun on Christmas break, he didn't 
[00:18:30]  want to go back.  But it didn't work.  He was unglued in time for class.  The boy's s*** fine, and his mother describes her son as a good kid, but says he's mischievous  like all kids.  See, it makes the story a little different now, doesn't it?  All of a sudden, Opia didn't seem like his hand anymore.  That's for sure.  You got that right, Anthony.  And then Sam handed one in. 
[00:19:00]  I'm like, Sam, you can't do anything else with that.  Danny did it all.  Put the bleach in the proper place, and it made it sound a little more mischievous.  Mischievous.  Right.  Mischievous.  And dirty, but Sam handed it in anyway, and here's what he came up with.  A boy in Mexico tried to skip school and got into a sticky situation, literally.  This 10-year-old snuck into the kitchen of his family's home early Monday, got industrial 
[00:19:30]  glue, slathered it on his right hand, and then grabbed the s*** of his s***.  When the boy's mother woke up, she found him in his room watching TV with his hand on the s***.  At first, she didn't think anything of it, but when she realized he was stuck, she spent  nearly two hours trying to get his hand free with water, oil, and nail polish remover.  The boy says he pulled the s*** because he had so much fun on Christmas break, he didn't  want to go back, but it didn't work.  He was unglued in time for class. 
[00:20:00]  The boy's s*** is fine, and his mother describes her son as a good kid.  But says he's mischievous, like all kids.  And there you go.  Yeah.  There you go.  I don't know who I hate more in that story.  The reporter, the mother's description of the kid being mischievous, or the kid.  The reporter's droning delivery.  It's horrendous.  It's awful.  Horrid.  All right, we're just getting started.  It's FU Friday, by the way.  We'll go to the FU line a little later on today, see what you guys are bitching about. 
[00:20:30]  We also have Howie Mandel checking in today.  Good friend of the show.  He's still calling, right?  We didn't trash him?  I don't know.  Is there another radio show that's going to blow up our spot on that one, too?  Did we call him names in our promo?  I don't think we did.  I don't think we did.  And also, we got a full house today.  Who's coming in?  We got Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice at 7, and then at 7.30, it's Bob and Louis C.K.  Bob.  Oh, very cool.  It's going to be one of those out-of-control shows today.  No one wanted to play with Bob last night.  Really?  Yeah, apparently. 
[00:21:00]  All right, we'll talk about that in just a bit.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're going to have a party today.  Patrice O'Neill has entered the studio.  Yeah.  He's brought one of my favorite people in the entire world with him, Gavin.  Gavin's an animal.  And poor basil teas, by the way, between these guys.  How much do you weigh, Gavin?  290.  What does he say?  290.  290?  Yeah.  290.  290.  All muscle, by the way. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  290.  Flat stomach.  How tall are you?  6'5".  6'5", 290.  Not an ounce of fat on him.  This guy is a problem.  And just always kind of in a good jovial mood, which just shows that he would rip you apart.  I think that's what I like about him, because I visualize him just beating the living crap out of somebody, smiling and laughing the entire time.  You're right.  And then you've got Patrice O'Neill sitting down on the couch.  How are you, Patrice?  Good morning.  Good morning.  What did you just order from basil teas over there? 
[00:22:00]  Something delicious.  My eyes are blurry, so I don't really know, but it looks like the color I eat.  Is it the diabetes?  You know how it is, man.  I got to drink some awful diabetic cold medicine.  Buckley's, it tastes like garbage.  Spud Buckley's?  In Canada.  You've tried Buckley's before?  I live for Buckley's.  The greatest stuff ever.  It burned my insides.  It told me I was sick.  Really?  It started to actually meld with whatever virus I got in my chest.  And that's what I get for taking care of my girl. 
[00:22:30]  Wait, she was sick?  Oh, she didn't.  And she wasn't the kind of sick.  Usually I ignore her sickness.  She's home and just deal with it, trooper.  Yeah.  But this one was like, she was begging for help, kind of.  Like, not begging literally, but like, her cough was like, I'm gonna die.  My will's in the safe upstairs.  And I'm just looking at her sucking my teeth.  You gotta pamper her and everything.  Not pamper her.  More like, just bring her stuff when I think she needs it.  Yeah.  And lock her in the room. 
[00:23:00]  And do you remind her, like, did you take your medicine?  Flowers in the attic.  Slip poison cookies under the door until she'd get better.  Patrice's idea of pampering is here.  That's exactly what I did every two hours.  Here.  I would throw two pills at her.  She would get them like one of the hungry rats that just got a, oh my God, it's food.  Yeah.  Just throw them at her.  Throw them in the room and just shut the door real fast.  She'd come peek out and just to say hi, get in there, get back, with a broomstick. 
[00:23:30]  But I took care of her.  Now, as soon as she left, feeling a little better, she had to go to the hospital and get  some, like, super duper stuff.  Yeah.  And, you know, now I got it.  And, you know, the worst thing about a cold is when you know it's coming.  And, like, some evil thing that you see, like the iceberg.  There's nothing you can do about it.  It's inevitable.  It's like the iceberg.  It's coming at you slow and you can't get out of the way for whatever reason.  It's a horrible feeling.  And the worst feeling is when you try all this stuff.  And I really want to smack whoever invented these little candy Alka-Seltzers that are supposed 
[00:24:00]  to help you fight a cold.  Airborne things.  It is the worst.  It's a drink.  Yeah.  It's just like orange juice.  It's delicious grapefruit flavor.  It's just.  But now I'm feeling okay.  That's why I always, like, you start talking and feeling entertaining and it's like.  Yeah.  Then you kind of forget about it.  I was listening to Al Sharpton's replay over here on Power.  Over there.  Oh, on the Power?  What was he saying today?  Well, I just, it was. 
[00:24:30]  He was upset about something, wasn't he?  I'm so nervous about being, like, publicly ever going against Al Sharpton because he, you  know, if the cops do something evil.  You want him there.  He is there.  No one else is ever there.  But sometimes it's just, I just think we're becoming, and we, meaning black people, we're  just becoming unreasonable.  And it's like that word lynch, the way that girl used it on the Golf Channel, I heard it  a million times.  I really want to be the guy that goes, get these crackers, get them.  Yeah.  It's just.  It was.  It's just unreasonable.  It was unreasonable. 
[00:25:00]  Well, Tiger Woods said he wasn't offended.  But some of the people are angry at Tiger Woods.  Right.  They, like, you know, almost, it's almost marginalizing.  Like, they go, oh, he don't know.  Because he doesn't, he's just, he's half Chinese.  He doesn't know.  Oh, God.  Like, that's what it's like.  Like, they, like, people will be on the radio saying, he don't, he just doesn't know how  to feel about this situation.  He's, he's, he has no clue.  It doesn't even matter.  He's known this, uh, woman forever.  She said lynch in the context.  I, I don't understand why context is disappearing. 
[00:25:30]  And it just, don't be unreasonable, man.  Yeah, context is gone.  Now, it's like, what, what are we fighting against now?  We're fighting against, uh, fraudulent slip racism now.  You know why?  And, and, Patrice, I brought this up the other day.  Black people, uh, as far as, uh, Obama goes with the, uh, uh, presidential election, black  people better hope he doesn't win.  Because the second he wins, black people have no excuses left in the whole goddamn country 
[00:26:00]  because a black man now made it to the pinnacle of, of the free world, president of the United  States, which means anything is possible for a black man in this country.  Look, that's, that's what white people are going to think.  That's, that's what white people are going to think.  White people are going to go, all right.  It's game over.  Even game over.  Oh, come on.  One of your guys is president of the United States.  You can do, if you apply yourself, everything is out there.  Every resource is out there to do whatever you do.  But, but, Tom, I'll tell you for a second.  Let's be honest.  Eh. 
[00:26:30]  It's a, it's only, uh, when he becomes president, or Hillary, either one, it's, it's basically  a, a symbol, and it's, it's a monument to something.  I don't know enough about politics to think that he's going to sign any bills that actually  make him the black president.  I don't think you should fear the black president.  Matter of fact, I think everything is going to be, like, he's going to go out of his way  to make sure that scrutiny of white people, because it's, because if he becomes president,  Fox channel is going to be now, you know, Obama network 24, it's going to be like President 
[00:27:00]  OJ, and anything he does is going to be scrutinized.  If he hires too many black people at the top, if he was the president and had Colin Powell  and Condoleezza Rice as his side people, yeah, you'd be like, oh, here we go.  Next thing is, raping white women's legal.  Yeah, it's, it's, it's not going to, nothing's going to, it's just, nothing'll change.  You don't have that much power to make drastic changes in that way.  There's too many checks and balances. 
[00:27:30]  Jimmy and I were discussing this the other day.  I'm not even talking about him changing stuff.  Not one.  I'm not talking about him changing stuff.  I'm talking about the perception now that black people have the man's foot on their  head and, and are being kept down when this guy is able to work himself up through his  entire life to be president of the United States.  That means that anybody can truly.  You're pretty high up on white thinking.  Yeah, yeah.  As far as white people thinking goes. 
[00:28:00]  I'm pretty up there, yeah.  You're pretty high up on, you know, pretty much the temperature of what white people think.  Thank you, sir.  I listen, I listen to this radio.  I really, Obi doesn't talk about politics that much in terms of, but Obi's very liberal  type of dude.  Like I, he's very fair guy.  You're unfair white guy.  I'm my unfair white guy.  I am, I am reality and people do not want to face it.  No, you're, you are the, you're the, you're the opposite.  Even though you're like, you're like an Italian dude. 
[00:28:30]  I ain't a white guy.  But you're very opposite, but you're, but you think, this is what, it kills me.  And this is what bothers me about like the O'Reilly's of the world.  Ooh, I'm being lumped in with the O'Reilly.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please.  You know, there you go.  Nah, I'm fraudy in this now, you know.  O'Reilly's an ass.  But I'm saying when people like that look at, it's an injustice for anybody in this  country who's in the know.  Al Sharpton's in the, in the know, dude.  He is deep.  I've seen him tackle the highest level of thinkers.  He's a bad dude when it comes to dodging and doing that and saying things. 
[00:29:00]  He's self-serving.  But, but when guys like that and guys like Bill O'Reilly use the general layman, like  to make them think that they're white and the general layman black person to make, you  know, oh yeah, this is, he's speaking for me.  And then some farmer named Fred in Nebraska thinks like O'Reilly is him and black people  are talking about him.  We're not talking about no dirty, you know, I got a $200 hat.  So it's like, I'm not looking at the average white guy as my oppressor. 
[00:29:30]  And I think it's unfair for the people who are not in the know to keep getting buked,  man.  The only thing about Obama is this.  Every president has a legacy.  Every president, no matter what he really did, he signed 75 bills.  George Washington cannot tell a lie.  He's the first president.  Lincoln freed the slaves.  Jimmy Carter with Iran hostage, whatever.  And what about, what about Taft? 
[00:30:00]  Don't know.  Got shot.  I mean, he was one of those dudes that got killed.  Reagan has a different kind of thing, but like Obama's legacy is already there.  No matter what he does, he can now comfortably be the president because his legacy is set.  So he can actually do some good and so couldn't Hillary because their legacy is set.  They're going to be defined as the first black president or the first woman president.  Yeah, but what word is used to define them depends on what he does. 
[00:30:30]  President N-word.  It's crazy, man.  It bothered me, that whole thing about this girl.  It's just like, what do we, stop being unfair.  Hey, Patrice, let me jump in here because I want to bring everyone, hold on, I want to bring everyone to the party.  Ariana Quincy Jones.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Just in case, uh, hold on, hold on, hold on, I just want to replay what Kelly Tillman said on the golf channel so everyone's on board.  All right.  This is what's bothering you.  It was an on-air conversation about Tiger Woods' dominance in golf until Kelly Tillman went there. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, maybe they should just gang up for a while until.  Lynch him in the back alley.  Yeah, that's right.  Lynch him in a back alley.  And then days later when she tried to apologize, she couldn't quite get that right either.  The other day we were joking around about ways to spur on these young players.  I made a brief comment that certainly wasn't meant to offend anyone involved.  And that was it.  She went on with her analysis of the tournament.  I hate that reporter because she made the apology and that was it. 
[00:31:30]  Well, yeah, that's what...  Wasn't good enough.  Wasn't good enough for him.  That's what you do.  You just do a quick apology and move on.  Now I got to wait to see if you slip up as a racist now.  That's what I do.  And what that's going to do is now all live everything will be stopped soon.  I was just envisioning that because just so no one bothers nobody, the Super Bowl will be played, then it will be shown the next day just to make sure Bucky Johnson didn't say, 
[00:32:00]  Negro boy, look at those knees growing.  What did he say?  Like, it's just ridiculous, man.  Hey, we got just a little bit more.  This is where Al Sharpton jumps in.  As for Tiger Woods, he made it clear tonight to a spokesman that he was not offended by the remarks.  The story is a non-issue.  The statement released tonight says Tiger has a great deal of respect for Kelly.  We know unequivocally that there was no ill intent, a sentiment not shared by Reverend Sharpton, who still plans protests unless Tillman is fired. 
[00:32:30]  Shouldn't that be good enough?  If Tiger says it's a non-issue and he wasn't offended, shouldn't that be good enough?  And then he...  I was listening this morning.  I think it was a replay.  But he started equating, what if he said to a Jewish athlete, you should take him in the back alley and put him in the gas chamber?  And I'm just like...  That's a little too...  It's so...  And that's not a term that people...  Yeah, that isn't a common...  Common, common, common spoken term.  That's not something you'd say. 
[00:33:00]  You know, oh God, this lynch him in an alley is like a sarcastic thing.  That's not something...  Gas him in an alley is something that's never said.  I'll tell you, in this day and age where you really got to watch what you say, be politically correct, people's jobs are in jeopardy if they slip up and say something,  bringing up the term lynching is all of a sudden now a racist remark.  It really is.  It wasn't just a few years ago.  No, then it was what it was.  It was really lynching.  But then, I mean, no, throughout like the 80s and stuff when you would mention lynching, it wasn't this racist term. 
[00:33:30]  Well, it was applied to Westerns, but it became synonymous with what was happening, you know, between 1901 and two weeks ago.  Yeah, but it only became synonymous with that recently, with this whole environment of political correctness that we live in now.  You can't say anything.  A noose.  A noose has become a symbol of racism.  It wasn't.  It was a symbol of like, you know, on Halloween you'd hang it up as some kind of a symbol of scary thing. 
[00:34:00]  It was scary and...  It's always been a symbol of violence, but my thing is, okay, let's say, it's the context, man.  I don't like getting angry before I actually...  There's a context to everything.  I don't believe in my heart, listening to that, that this girl...  And the thing is, intent versus impact, because I heard him say, look, you can...  She might not be racist, but if you murder somebody, you can't say, I've never done that before. 
[00:34:30]  It's unreasonable.  Yeah.  Because if she slipped up, if she had another chance to think on the top of it, she just meant all these golfers need to just beat him up because he's so good.  Yeah.  That's what she said, that's what she meant, and it's a shame, because I sound like the big old fat apologist.  I'm here hanging out with white guys, and I'm like, but that's how I feel.  You were on the power, you'd be talking differently.  If I was on the power, I'd be going, uh, you know...  First of all, you would change your dialect.  No, I wouldn't, man.  You'd speak their language a little bit. 
[00:35:00]  We've seen Patrice in action.  I just...  Ooh, I almost said it.  I'm just messing with you.  It's just like, that's what I'm saying.  I wish Brett Favre had been fighting dogs instead of Michael Vick, so it'd be easier for me not to like him.  By the way, there's a lot of black guys listening to the show, and they will call up and agree with you, Patrice.  You don't have to be so paranoid by speaking the truth.  But in general, I think it's just...  And you blew it with Fox anyway.  They don't have you on anymore because...  No, sometimes John Gibson will sneak me on his radio show, but they don't have nothing to do. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, damn, is that funny.  I saw Sean Hannity in the hallway, and he put up his big collar over the side of his face and tiptoe by.  Did he really?  And I said, Sean, you know, you're running for some office.  I feel it.  He's like, no.  He hugs me.  I'm like, stop playing, Sean.  It's not right.  I didn't expect you top-level white boys to love me for that long.  You had one of the greatest TV appearances ever for the people that haven't checked it out yet.  Oh, they had to apologize and everything.  Patrice is explaining the donkey punch and all these other things. 
[00:36:00]  That was on Fox.  That was right below Ruby shooting Oswald.  As far as I was concerned.  Yeah.  It was.  That went out on my television.  TV moments, yeah.  And he had to...  Dude, that's what I'm saying.  It's like that initially...  I was hoping it would get some kind of ruckus.  Yeah, yeah.  To get me removed from something.  Yeah.  I don't have a job.  They said nothing.  Nothing.  They picketed D.L. Hewley.  But old nobody.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Stands up.  It took D.L. Hewley to say it, you know, about the diamonds thing.  And they picketed him about...  But it's like...  I really wish that we would stop.  Black people would just stop being unreasonable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The context issue is huge.  Oh.  And that's what it's all about.  Let's go to Bruce.  He's calling.  Bruce, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  I just wanted to add in on the conversation to say that I don't find it offensive what  she said.  Because to be totally honest with you, I mean, she was giving him a compliment. 
[00:37:00]  He's a good golf player.  I mean, she was just giving him a compliment.  And one more thing I want to add.  Anthony, I want you to elaborate on why you feel that we're not a better country being  that Obama would be elected.  I want you to chime in on that.  Oh, that's just it?  I don't know.  It's my own personal fear.  I don't know.  It's my own personal fear of a black president.  What am I going to do?  I'm a white guy.  And the speech starts off. 
[00:37:30]  His inaugural speech is...  And the thing goes...  Ooh.  Attention.  White people better start running right now.  Because the war is over.  We're going to announce the war's over.  Because we need all the soldiers back so we can kill white people.  And save some for eating them.  Don't mind this grass skirt that I have on.  Because I'm going to enjoy eating white people. 
[00:38:00]  And juggling white babies.  That is the new American sport.  White baby juggling.  It's like, what are you...  Will y'all stop?  Will you stop?  It's not so much what he would do as president.  It's the symbolism that is him being the president.  That would then probably get black America more to the point of taking things out of context.  And being like, oh boy. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  We understand.  And then they'll look for the black president too.  But they don't realize...  Your guy's in charge now.  He's not the black president.  He's going to be a black president.  Al Sharpton would be the black president.  Oof.  Like, I'm not saying...  I don't know what his politics would be.  But if you...  Al Sharpton would be the black president.  Where it would be like, uh-oh.  White people might need to be nervous.  It doesn't matter.  Black people will see Obama as president.  And the guy could be...  He could be worse than Bush as far as being a right wing or something like that. 
[00:39:00]  Just imagine him being that bad.  Black people would still be going, hey, our guy's in there.  Now, let me ask you.  You know politics.  Let me ask you this.  Both of you guys and everybody.  Would another president have been better during this time?  If all the events that happened during Bush's presidency...  Would somebody be changing it?  Would we not be at a war?  Would we not be doing something?  Is George Bush...  Did he...  Is he that bad?  Meaning, where the towers hit the building and we just called for a war. 
[00:39:30]  Now, would anybody...  Would Clinton had not called for war?  Well, Obama had not called for war.  And we're stuck in this situation.  Only if they had bad black advisors like Rice.  I can't even laugh the way I want you to ask.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  Patricia O'Neill has joined the show.  We've got basil teas.  You can hear the frying pan frying in the background, sizzling in the background.  We've got English Gavin here.  He's not going to add much to the show, but we just love having him around.  I don't know why. 
[00:40:00]  I don't know what it is about this guy, but we love him.  I actually thought of Gavin the other day.  It's very odd to see him this morning.  Well, he gave us one of the best pieces of audio ever.  It could never be played here.  Yeah, we'll try to explain it after the break for the newbies.  Also, I want to turn you on to Patrice O'Neill.  Well, school's broad on funny.  You pop that in YouTube, and you're going to laugh your ass off this morning if you haven't seen that video yet.  And we'll also put that link up on onaradio.com later today.  And we're going to go check out the F.U. line before we take a break here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:40:30]  When we get back, smoking guy.  Got to get into smoking guy.  And Clement's admitting he did the steroids there, Patrice.  We'll explain next.  Who admitted it?  Well.  Well.  Well.  Well.  We'll explain it after the break.  But first, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to my ex-boss, Mike. 
[00:41:00]  You promised to f***ing hire me back.  And it's been 90 days.  You f***ing go cheat on your wife.  You were supposed to hire me back, and you didn't.  You lied.  F*** you.  Next message.  I want to give a f*** you to my manager for making everyone's life out.  I hope you get kicked in the f***ing face.  Next message.  I want to give a big f*** you to my mom, who's cheating on my dad.  And he doesn't even know it.  And actually, I'm glad she listens to ONA so she can hear this.  Mom, f*** you.  Next message.

[00:42:00]  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Let's get right back into it.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neill.  English Gavin in studio.  Basil Tees cooking breakfast.  Bob Kelly and Louis C.K. will be on the radio in about a half hour.  It's a busy, busy show.  Yes.  And then we start our weekends.  Our weekend.  This is the big weekend for Anthony.  Private jet, Mohegan's done.  They want their money back. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Flying up there to Mohegan.  They're flying us up.  Wow.  Nice.  Well, what happened was Anthony took them for a few.  Yeah, I don't like going into exact numbers.  Well, he used to go into exact numbers.  But he, you know.  On the airwaves here.  But he finally realized it might not be a smart thing to do that.  Doesn't a jet cost?  Yeah.  $300,000.  Well, Patrice. 
[00:43:00]  I ain't paying for it.  He took them for a few.  Let's just put it that way.  So they want their money back.  And they've sent the jet.  They sent the jet to bring them back.  What if you fly up there and just relax?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what Kenny was saying.  You should just play the quarter slots for the whole weekend.  Like, will they come down and make you do something?  Take you to the back room and go, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  The attic in him will make him do something.  Of course.  He's sitting in a casino.  No, I want to play. 
[00:43:30]  And they know that.  Anthony's officially a whale.  I must play the game.  You're a whale, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they got the suites ready for him.  They got the jet that's going to pick him up.  Taking my mother and Sal.  Oh, the airport's 15 minutes from his home.  Keith and his wife.  What airport?  The Republic.  That's out there on Long Island.  And you just send it to the airport you need?  You just go.  You drive right up to the plane.  You take your bags.  You go in.  If you lived in Queens, would that have still been the airport?  Or are they flying into the most convenient airport for you? 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  You know, Keith arranged it, but it is.  It's like five minutes from my house.  They want him back in a big way, and they want their few back.  Well, I bet you there'll be a couple of Arab, Emirates, a couple of old Chinese guys.  Yeah, they're going to put them all in one room.  All the whales in one room.  Jeez.  Michael Jordan will be on there.  Yeah.  All the big gamblers.  Damn.  We should have a story on Monday. 
[00:44:30]  We'll see how the weekend is.  We'll see if.  It should be a good one.  Is that three-car poker?  No, I'm going to be playing blackjack.  That's what I'm going to be playing.  The three-car is, that's more of a social game.  Three-car is for a little bit of fun in between.  You have fun with your friends, but if you're getting down to that serious gambling, you do the blackjack.  Like that.  Yeah.  That's what you took them for.  Yeah.  Oh, that was all blackjack.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, and some bitch, before I went into the high roller table and the reserve tables and stuff like that, I was just at a regular table. 
[00:45:00]  And I'm sitting there, and I stacked my chips up, and they were all like black chips, all hundreds, and a few of the bigger ones underneath.  But they were stacked up about two feet high right next to me.  So right next to my head, as I'm leaning on the table, I'm just going, with the top eight chips or so.  And it was stacked up, I mean, thousands upon thousands of dollars right there. 
[00:45:30]  And some woman sitting at the table, who's playing like $25 chips, looks at me and goes, could you stop doing that?  And meanwhile, I'm laying out like six grand a bet, at least, minimum.  And I just turned, I looked at her, and just went, I kept doing it.  I was like, do you honestly think I'm going to stop doing anything I want to do right here at this table? 
[00:46:00]  She's playing a $25 hand, and you're playing for thousands.  Yeah.  That's why they got those private games.  Exactly, to get away from the riffraff that just screws you.  That doesn't know what the hell they're doing.  They're hitting.  I got 19.  Hit me.  That's a lot of money, man.  $6,000.  Oh, that's easy.  That was just the start.  That's on the low side.  The table maximum was $6,000.  So I was playing two hands.  So that's $12,000 a hand for the two hands. 
[00:46:30]  And then you have to double down sometimes.  The biggest hand I had, I think, was something like $36,000 on one little round.  Is there anything in you that's saying, you know, this is ridiculous?  No, you've got to write it off when you're in the action like that.  If you start thinking like that, you're screwed.  They should make you play with actual stuff.  Oh, I'll play with actual money?  Actual money, yeah.  No, that would be scary.  The chips are pretty.  You play with fun little color-y chips. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  It's nice.  What's wrong, Patrice?  What's the matter, Patrice?  I had fajitas last night.  Did you just sit down and blast one out the second you sat?  That's not even early morning stink.  That's a stink from two days ago.  Rod, you got Crohn's disease, brother.  Jesus, man.  He's got his Red Sox sweatshirt on and a cabbie hat.  You smell that, Mr. Throw-up-at-everything?  No, no.  He's throwing up right now on his own inside. 
[00:47:30]  It's really bad, huh?  It's still over there.  So what do you think, Patrice?  So he's going back.  The good news about Anthony, though, he was, I've got to say it, he was out of control  with this gambling thing, and he kind of, he went on hiatus for a while, but this weekend  he's back.  Well, I only, let me tell you what I do.  I only gamble when I end up at a casino.  I don't search out casinos.  That's what everyone does.  Yeah, I know, but I don't.  No one can you gamble.  Right.  Exactly, but I don't.  I only rape when there's a woman there.  I knew you were going to say that sounds weird, but I don't seek out casinos. 
[00:48:00]  It's usually a situation where when we were on the road doing the virus tour.  You were searching out casinos.  But we were in locations where casinos were close.  Not in Detroit.  Yeah, that was kind of close.  An hour?  It was, that wasn't bad.  Was it Greektown or something like that?  Yeah, something like that.  And it wasn't, it wasn't quite an hour, but it wasn't that bad.  It's, it's, it was, and we were on the road and stuff and it was fun.  Yeah.  But when I'm just working and taking weekends, you know, I don't go seeking out casinos to 
[00:48:30]  go gambling.  But when I do go, I go.  He's all in.  I'm in for it.  I go for, you know.  A lot of commas.  Yes.  Yes, I go for the commas.  I had to go to the box yesterday.  You don't ever get nervous?  I had to go to the safety deposit box yesterday.  You don't ever get nervous?  Like, oh, there's a, there's a thrill.  There's a, yeah, little nerves you get like, oh, this is a biggie.  This is a biggie.  And when you hit it, it's like, yeah!  Everyone yells, and they got to shovel out like frigging $70,000 to you. 
[00:49:00]  You ever do something imposing, like just hit your girl with a glass on top of her head?  Just smack her in the...  $12,000 loss.  You just smash it.  And you apologize like Ike Turner.  Like, I'm sorry, baby, you know.  And she goes, I know, I understand.  That is bad, though, when they, you know, you got like, you're sitting on a $20,000, and you got like $12,000 up there.  And the dealer ekes out a $21,000, and they just pull that $12,000 away, and you go, what the... 
[00:49:30]  But it's, well...  There's a garbage man right now making a decision on never to take your garbage away again.  Hey, I got to jump in, Ant, because a lot of people bring it up on Instant Feedback.  Now, $36,000 a hand, you said, or in one round of Blackjack, right?  How much...  Back in the day when you were, you know, an air conditioning guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How many years of work was that?  I never had that much at one time. 
[00:50:00]  That's what I'm saying.  You said you had one round of Blackjack, $36,000, that's easily a year's salary.  More than I ever made.  That's what I'm saying.  Or more than a year's salary.  More than I ever made until I got into radio.  Wow, your life is weird.  Can I ask you a question?  What year did you forget where you came from?  Oh, let me think.  When did you decide that you can waste $36,000?  I never do.  I never forget where I came from.  That's why.  No, I know where I am now.  But I know where I was, and that's why I'm enjoying myself. 
[00:50:30]  I'm having a good goddamn time.  You could be again.  I'm not.  No, no, because I also make sure I'm not an idiot who's just going to, like, be MC Hammer.  How do you do that saying that you bet $36,000?  Like, you already said I'm an idiot by doing that.  No.  Believe it or not, that is...  Where's your draw point?  That's found money.  Now, this is idiotic right here.  That's found money.  Oh, you're only gambling with the money you won.  Let's turn the mics off for a second.  Really?  Yeah, go to the music.  If we got the music. 
[00:51:00]  Do we have the whole music?  Hold on a minute.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We do the same once in a while.  You got to give Patrice a secret message.  I got to tell Patrice, because he's not quite understanding.  Okay, hold on.  Here's the whole thing.  I got to put it in perspective.  We'll be right back in, like, literally a second.  Make sure you shut those mics off.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, my God.  Game on.  Oh, my God.  Game on.  There you go.  Man, Bobby.  Wow.  Now it makes sense.  It makes a lot of sense.  Now you understand, right?  I apologize.  I apologize.  Now you understand, right?  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Now you're a bit of a sissy. 
[00:52:00]  Is this a Holiday Inn Express?  Who is this guy?  That's Basil Tees.  Yeah, good stuff.  Why don't you go up?  I always forget where you're from, Basil Tees.  Basil Tees, Brew Pub and Grill, Hooper Avenue in Tom's River, New Jersey.  Hooper.  There you go.  He comes in every once in a while and cooks breakfast for everybody.  Wow.  So, oh, the second Bobby goes up there, it's going to look like Godzilla trudging through  Tokyo. 
[00:52:30]  Nothing.  Hey, we got a couple of things we can do right now.  We could do the Dr. Phil racist Xbox or we could do the anti-smoking ad.  I like the anti-smoking guy.  Okay.  Here in New York, they really, really want everyone to stop smoking.  I guess they're doing it in all the cities, but it seems like they really go overboard  here in New York with their anti-smoking ads.  They try to gross you out.  There was a couple of commercials.  There was first a hole-in-the-throat guy who says, I like to go swimming, but I can't 
[00:53:00]  go swimming anymore.  Right.  Yeah.  And then there was...  This is why I love Gavin, because he laughs at the best stuff.  Like I do.  The horrific stuff.  You enjoy the bad stuff, right?  Back home, we got the no-smoking ban in right now.  Yeah.  And they've got adverts about poor commercials, as you say, over here.  People coughing up their lungs on a plate.  You're like...  And you just laugh.  I'm just like, ah, so it makes me give up smoking. 
[00:53:30]  I don't cough up my lungs.  There's another commercial where they showed organs.  They took out, like, a heart out of, of course, a dead person.  And then they squeeze out the arteries, like a toothpaste tube.  And you just see this white gook come out.  It's just like all this clogged ick come out of it.  And that was disgusting.  And then, of course, the lungs.  They show the blackened lungs.  That doesn't deter one person.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:54:00]  In Canada, they have a dead baby on a cigarette box.  Wow.  Really?  A dead, just a dead fetus.  And they still smoke.  And they still smoke.  It's addiction.  Fetuses are smoking.  It's addiction.  I think I had an Oreo cookie two days ago.  And I know it'll kill me.  But you pray to God, and it just doesn't work.  They're so tasty.  The smoke will kill you on the pocket.  Yeah, yeah.  It says on the box.  It says, you know.  You can't even lie anymore.  Those true commercials are annoying.  Like, they're not even...  It's just like people...  I can't stand them. 
[00:54:30]  It's this young man.  We're going to take on Big Tobacco, man.  When you say to your mother, Mom, I love you, I don't want you to die of lung cancer.  And she blows smoke rings in your face.  There's no commercials.  I want you to be here as long as I'm here.  I want you to live my life and give me those speeches.  You have some type of intervention, and you still can't stop smoking.  Here's what they've done over the years with the cigarette boxes.  Years ago, it used to only say, caution, cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health. 
[00:55:00]  May.  May.  Maybe.  And then they put warning.  The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is harmful or dangerous or whatever.  But it used to just be, hey, take a little caution here.  Relax.  Yeah.  Well, Bobby's got a pack of cigarettes right in front of him.  Hey, Bobby.  Hey, Bobby.  The Surgeon General's warning.  Warning.  Warning.  Smoking may cause. 
[00:55:30]  Smoking causes.  Not may cause.  It used to be may cause.  Yeah.  Now it's causes.  Lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.  May.  You know there's no other product.  And may put Bobby out of his misery from his career.  Wouldn't that be enough for you to stop smoking?  No other product could have a label like that on it and not be ripped from the shelves.  Ripped from the shelves.  You know what commercials are effective, though?  The ones I've done recently?  Having smokers that were screwed up or good. 
[00:56:00]  And there's one where they show people who have lost all these things.  They're smoking.  Sometimes it doesn't kill you.  And they show you that guy with a voice box.  Oh, the guy without a jaw.  The guy without a living, but without a piece of a jaw.  That's what made me stop, was I was afraid they were going to take a piece of my jaw.  What piece?  That was a tangible thing.  And you know what always stops?  It stops from, two things stop you from doing things.  I don't know about women, but men.  One, aesthetics.  Two, is if anything that makes your jammy stop working. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  That would do it.  Anything that makes your jammy stop working.  And aesthetics make people stop.  Yeah, put that on the cigarette box.  A lot of people will quit immediately.  Yeah.  Immediately.  Just take Joe Camel off and just put a dude that looks like Joe Camel because he got  no bottom face and he's just, he can only make Camel grunts.  Just have a button you push on the cigarette carton.  This is you, big man, if you keep smoking.  You need to just have a rag with you all the time to catch whatever slop is falling out 
[00:57:00]  of your mouth.  He spits like a camel.  Just spits in your face.  Did you see The Insider?  I've never seen that before.  I just watched it.  It was the weirdest movie and that doesn't stop people from smoking.  That movie itself is just don't smoke.  An anti-smoking ad.  Don't do it.  But addiction, people cannot overlook what addiction is, man.  You just got to be happy.  Whatever your addiction is, it's not like, Bobby smokes.  I'm glad I don't smoke, but I'm diabetic and cookies haunt me. 
[00:57:30]  That's your cigarette, yeah.  He has that one too.  But some people are addicted to smoking cookies.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I was about to say.  But he doesn't have diabetes, though.  You know what I mean?  I'm just not going to die from it yet.  It's not killing him.  Can I just say something, though?  Yesterday at the gym, because yesterday's show, I immediately...  Yesterday at where?  At a guy named Jim's house.  Stop lying, Bobby.  Stop lying.  You and your friend Jimmy, what happened?  I went to the gym immediately after the show yesterday.  You don't know what happened yesterday. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, my God.  A lot of fat.  A lot of fat stuff.  Not a lot.  More than usual, I guess.  You're right.  There's a different word for a lot.  It's married now, dude.  It's called me.  He doesn't need to be sexy anymore.  No, I do.  I do.  I do.  For your health, you got to quit smoking.  You got to...  Yeah.  I'm going to quit smoking, but I went yesterday, and I got...  I got...  When your blood sugar goes down.  What's that called?  I guess when your blood sugar goes down.  It's called diabetes, from what I heard. 
[00:58:30]  Hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia, right.  Hypoglycemia?  Dude, I started...  My hand started shaking, and I was a second behind everything this guy was saying to me.  Like, I couldn't respond.  You was going to go into a coma, Bobby.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, that's what that's about.  That's a coma.  And you ate throughout the whole show, so what is that about?  This guy had...  I had a cereal yesterday.  Two cereals.  Two sugary, crunchy cereals.  I had cereals.  Well, it was raisin bran.  It wasn't a raisin bran crunch.  It was raisin bran crunch.  Of course it was. 
[00:59:00]  It's like...  That's like eating candy.  It's rock candy with raisins on it.  Oh, is that why you were telling me?  So much sugar on that.  They deep fry the raisins in sugar.  Really?  Basically.  That's why it's so damn good.  It's cake and raisins.  Bobby saw raisins and thought it was healthy.  No, and it's ice cream raisin.  It's a lot of good.  I got to eat that awful kashi that tastes like...  It just tastes like...  Cardboard.  It tastes like something somebody ate and missing an action, too.  It's like something if you're in a bamboo cage and your face is sticking out of water 
[00:59:30]  and they just give you poshie cereal.  It tastes like packing peanuts.  I remember we were coming home from a gig.  We had to stop around six times.  He had to pee on the side of the road because this guy...  Really?  Then we stopped at a gas station to get gas.  I came out of the bathroom.  He's by the car with a yoo-hoo and a coffee cake.  I'm like, we're never going to make it home.  And I want to stop because I carry around a switch cup that, you know, so I can just  pee anytime I need to.  I'm like, just...  Like a nunchuck...  Nunchuck cup. 
[01:00:00]  It's like, oh, I got to piss.  Hey, let's get back to the smokey really fast.  We were leaning toward the latest anti-smoking ad they're playing in New York, and we got  an update on this guy.  So, want to just play the ad at this point?  Yeah, play the ad.  This is how it is.  Listen to this guy.  Listen to what's wrong with this guy, right?  I had my first heart attack when I was 28 years old.  I had another heart attack at 29.  My first stroke was when I was 30.  At the time, I had seven blood clots, and my foot just stopped getting blood. 
[01:00:30]  Turned all kinds of color.  And as much as I tried to ignore the smell, it wouldn't go away.  Every bit of this is from smoking.  And this part is where I had my first cigarette exactly 40 years ago.  Yeah, he did the commercial in a schoolyard with no leg, by the way.  That wasn't the gangrene one, was it?  I don't know.  Would it have toes was black?  Did you see that one?  No, they didn't show it.  He just talked about how he lost his foot.  He was standing there with one leg in a schoolyard saying, this is where I started smoking 40 
[01:01:00]  years ago, and this is all the crap that happened to me.  Two heart attacks before he was 30.  Four zero or four?  40.  40.  What did I say?  40.  Oh, I think he said 40.  Oh, yeah.  Two heart attacks before 30, a stroke, early 30s, lost his leg, and, well, this is the  update.  They did a little research on this guy today.  He's still smoking.  Stress?  He's still.  He's stressed out with you for one shoe that fits.  And with that, I got to ask. 
[01:01:30]  He's stressed out from shoe shopping.  That's awful.  With that, I got to ask Jimmy one question.  Do you think this guy likes smoking?  This guy doesn't like smoking.  He loves it.  I love you.  Good guy.  He loves it.  He's playing inside the commercial.  He has, like, a little smoking thing.  What's the little thing you put in your mouth where you attach the cigarette to?  Oh, the cigarette holder?  The big long one?  Yeah.  Like your socialite?  It's on the front page of the Daily News.  Blow and smoke.  He's told you of his heart attacks, a stroke, and losing a leg. 
[01:02:00]  But get this.  He still smokes.  Front page of the paper today.  That guy just can't get away from the cigarettes.  I'd like to see the politicians take that one on.  Every time they bring up those dumb video games being violent and, you know, influencing  kids, you sit there and go, hello.  How about we look at the smoking thing, then?  Why wouldn't they just...  Now, okay, like the Marlboro Man and the Camel, Joe Camel, and all the things they did to make 
[01:02:30]  cigarettes look cool, it does that.  Do you think smoking has stopped, like, in terms of numbers?  Yeah, the percentage of young people starting is a lot less.  It's actually...  Yeah, recently they just did it in New York.  It's down a bit.  It goes in waves, smoking.  It always has.  The other day, it seems like kids are smoking more these days than, I don't know, let's  say 10 years ago.  And tobacco itself, is that bad?  If you just say, pick tobacco up out the ground and wrap it up and smoke it? 
[01:03:00]  Or do they put a bunch of chemicals in it?  Oh, they do put a bunch of chemicals in it.  Put a little stuff in there to make it taste a little better, make it a little more addictive.  Make it last longer, make it burn right, but they also do things that make it kind of  more addictive, I think.  Yeah, they got it all figured out.  The paper smokes real quick.  Like, American Spirits are supposed to have no chemicals, and the paper they put on them  is slow-burning paper.  Yeah.  So the cigarette lasts a long time, so you're supposed to smoke less.  The cigarette company doesn't want that, though. 
[01:03:30]  They want you to burn through them pretty quickly.  Every other cigarette company wants quick, they have the regular paper on it that you  go through, like, two and five.  So all they need to do, cigarette companies, is just say, it's just like the bleach companies.  Like, if you make bleach, you just go, bleach can burn your insides, but enjoy it.  We make it for drinking.  But bleach will kill you right away.  But please, we're going to put it in sexy bottles, call it bleach, it is, it cleans your  clothes, and you can drink it, but you will die immediately. 
[01:04:00]  That's what cigarettes are.  Cigarettes is like, oh, we don't have to change a damn thing about what we do.  No.  We do all these things, chemicals, burning, da-da-da-da, and then at the same time, all  we got to do is just say, this will kill you.  That's the oddest thing about it, is they pulled stuff off of the shelves for so much  less.  Oh, two out of 10,000 rats died when they ate, like, 80 tons of this stuff.  So take it off the shelves. 
[01:04:30]  You know, we can't give it to people.  But cigarettes, they know it kills you.  They know it.  They're paying somebody big money.  Well, it's a huge industry.  It's a giant industry.  A lot of these old-time Southern politicians made their money on tobacco, and their family  still has interest in tobacco.  Their constituency in the South are tobacco farmers.  So they can't stop smoking.  It's all about cash.  It's all about the cash. 
[01:05:00]  Smoking is cool, though.  Smoking is cool.  Why are you worried about a black president when your people just will kill us all?  Smoking is cool.  It's all white people.  There's not one black person responsible for the death of the world.  Really?  Maybe one white boy.  How about...  Mr. White Guy with his Colonel Sanders tie is just creating cigarettes and killing it  all.  What do you think?  It was some Englishman over in Africa that might have found a monkey a little sexy?  And you guys helped, too. 
[01:05:30]  And started AIDS?  Yes!  What do you think?  Y'all always peeking around over there.  You guys were in the fields getting all the tobacco for us.  You helped.  Wait a minute.  Nobody who lives where they live damaged.  Like the little fat Mexican-looking people over the apocalypto people.  You think they go in the woods and desecrate?  White people fly all over the world and desecrate everything.  And we can fly.  They can't.  Exactly.  You know, there's some sacrifice that has to be done when you want to motor around the 
[01:06:00]  country and fly and go to the moon and things like that.  You've got to screw up.  There's going to be some collateral damage.  Thank you.  But stop with the cigarettes.  Stop with the oil.  Could you just stop?  Well, the oil's kind of hard.  Oil?  That's kind of an Arabian.  Cigarettes?  Yeah.  The oil's kind of hard to give up.  But we've already proven that we have sunshine, too.  All right.  What do you drive, Mr. Oil?  Yeah.  I've seen you.  A rickshaw.  I've seen you in that garage.  A rickshaw with an Indian guy that pulls this.  That goddamn thing is, it should be on tracks. 
[01:06:30]  You drive a locomotive.  He basically drives a monster truck at this point.  I think it's SUV I've ever seen.  It's one of those hybrids.  It's a hybrid.  All right.  Yeah, it's a hybrid.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Louis C.K. is joining the program next.  And we're going to get into the Clemens audio we played yesterday.  It's just terrific.  And another song from Val Kilmer on the way.  We've got to talk about.  We've got a lot of gamers in the studio today.  Dr. Phil did a whole thing on the racist Xbox.  What?  We were just talking about this. 
[01:07:00]  What?  We were just talking about this yesterday.  And he did a whole thing on his show yesterday as well.  Oh, good.  How people are using the Xbox to say racist things while they're doing their online gaming.  Who said that?  Did you hear him and he just quieted down?  Dr. Phil said that?  Yeah.  Has he been listening to the games?  Jesus.  Does he listen to our show?  It's the exact thing we were talking about yesterday.  All right.  All on the way on the Opie and Anthony show.  Cigarettes are bad.  Smoking is a horrible vice.  It shortens life expectancy and pollutes our air.  And according to recent polls, air is good. 
[01:07:30]  Cigarettes killed my father and raped my mother.  Gentlemen, I propose we send a message to tobacco companies everywhere by fining infinity billion dollars.  That's the spirit, Frank.  But I think a real number might be more effective.  All in favor of fining this evil tobacco giant, 100 million dollars, say aye.  Aye.  But that'll bankrupt us.  Oh, you mean the way you've morally bankrupted America?  No. 
[01:08:00]  Boosie.  No.  Busy, busy morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't know how we're going to get everyone's plugs in, but we're going to try.  We got Patrice O'Neill.  Thank you.  This means you out there in Radioland, you've got to pay close attention.  I'm going to give, I think, three, maybe four plugs right now.  Patrice O'Neill is going to be at Governor's Comedy Club out there on Long Island today and tomorrow. 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  In Levittown, right?  It's a great club.  I haven't been there in a while, but Governor's is a great club.  They do a good job out there.  It's going to be a nightmare getting out to Long Island, so you better leave now.  Yeah, I'm probably going to take your advice.  Patrice, you've got to leave real early, Patrice, or the 8 o'clock show is going to be disappointing  because you're not going to be on that stage.  And you're talking leaving at 5 to get to a 9 o'clock show is leaving late.  Five?  Leaving at, Jimmy said it, two or three.  This way you can go, you're relaxing the hotel.  Yeah.  You have no choice.  You're under the weather. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  It's rush hour all the time going out to Long Island.  Then you've got Bob Kelly sitting next to Patrice stuffing his fat face,  and he's going to be at Caroline's here in New York City.  What's his name?  Bob has cheese connecting his...  It looks like the beginning of a great porno scene.  Or the ending.  Or the ending.  Or the ending.  Sure.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100 is Caroline's.  You there just one show tonight?  Friday, Saturday, 10-30, Sunday, 8 o'clock. 
[01:09:30]  And we're all looking forward to the Comedy Central special that you taped a while ago.  They're finally showing that.  January 18th.  January 18th.  And once again, I was at that taping, and Bobby was great.  Absolutely great.  Really?  Did you...  He was great.  No joke.  Standing ovation, everything.  Did you see my depth jam set that's going to air Sunday?  No, but I've been obsessed.  I told Patrice this.  That hat, walking out like he's Big E, just a man who's got to face to face.  I can't tell you how badly I wanted to use some sort of weapon to remove that hat.  A pickaxe.  What a great way to get that hat off. 
[01:10:00]  I was trying to upgrade my appearance.  I think it looks good on you.  I think you actually pull it off.  It annoys me that it looks good.  Not many people can.  It annoys me that he's recreated himself as actually kind of a suave player, and it works.  You know why?  Because you're a big guy, and the hat and the leather and stuff, it's very intimidating.  Even though I know you're, you know, a pussy.  You know.  I tell people that.  Nice guy.  Also, you've been animated by Coke Logic.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:10:30]  It's cold out here or whatever, that bit you did with the rest area where the guy's knocking on the window.  No one told me.  Looking for some action, and you're just in the rest area.  You're in the rest area.  I told me these things.  I'm, you know.  Getting a few...  I just got a publicist.  My publicist needs to know these things.  Well, the animation's doing very well on iTunes.  We've got to deal with iTunes right now.  Really?  You go to iTunes.  Can you tell me?  We're not getting money either.  I didn't ask for money.  All right, all right.  I just want somebody to know me.  Well, it's just good promotion for the show.  Some of these animations have made it to iTunes.  You go to the podcast section. 
[01:11:00]  It's called O&A Shorts.  You download them for free.  Really?  We're not asking for nothing.  What's my say, Patrice O'Neal?  Yeah, and it looks like you're there.  Look, right there.  That's how you look animated.  There's a creepy guy at the window.  Wow!  How cool is that?  And he just does it to the story.  Yeah, yeah.  He uses the audio from the show.  You know the ones they showed, a traveling virus?  It's kind of like that vibe.  You just play the radio show.  Wow!  Yeah, and you just go to iTunes.  They're throwing one up a week, I think.  An animation up a week that you can download for free. 
[01:11:30]  Just page me.  Say something.  I love that.  I love myself in cartoon form for some reason.  Yeah, isn't that good?  Oh my God, yo.  And you pull in, and then the creepy guy comes up to your window.  Yeah.  When you sleep.  Oh my gosh!  How cool is that?  There you are, animated sleeping.  Oh!  You wake up because someone's knocking on your window.  And he's just standing there.  Oh my gosh.  That's what happened.  That's him! 
[01:12:00]  That's the creepy guy.  Is Coke Logic the dude?  Why does a creepy guy look like Norton?  Norton with his hair growing in a little bit.  Yeah, George Bush a little bit.  Yeah, young George Bush.  Holy.  Yeah.  We're very proud of these animations.  That is amazing.  I'm glad whoever.  I don't know.  I'm so happy he did that, man.  Great.  Logan got this deal done.  Really?  Yeah, it's great.  Great promotion for the show.  This is the way you do it right here.  You get iTunes involved, O&A Shorts, podcast section. 
[01:12:30]  That internet, the next big thing I hear.  By the way, one of the top downloads on iTunes every week is these animations.  People are eating them up.  So there you go, Patrice.  Thanks for telling me.  Ten days into 2008.  How long?  Sorry, recently.  It's a recent.  Wow, man.  And we got Louis C.K.  joining the program as well.  A very, very busy studio today.  Any gigs you're doing, Lou?  I'm in Miami on Wednesday, but nobody cares. 
[01:13:00]  What?  Why Wednesday?  Wednesday.  Why?  It's part of the festival.  They're having the South Beach Comedy Festival.  And then after that, this weekend, I'm in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky.  Louisville for Louis C.K.  Look at that.  My first time playing Louisville.  Cool.  Bob, that'd be like you working in douche town.  Or you working in tranny town.  Oh.  No, but he's not a tranny.  You didn't get how that would work.  It says for a free trial. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Stick up for him, Lou.  No, he had sex with tranny.  Hold on.  Everyone's talking at the same time.  Yeah, exactly.  I just wanted to know about this cartoon.  I'm enamored with this cartoon.  Yeah.  Nobody cares about this cartoon.  For a free 14-day.  Don't.  Look it.  Can you not take a little glory?  I've seen you with a big cartoon, too, Mr. Sneaky.  I think it's great, but we talked about it for a long time now.  I don't care.  Wait a minute, Louisville.  Just hold on.  See, it's something about pushy Hispanics.  You know what?  Pushy Hispanics.  Louis C.K.  It says for a short. 
[01:14:00]  But you're a guy that needs to be cut off sometimes.  All the time, but I just need to know.  Otherwise, it would all be you.  You're like, you're not even, you can't be a minority.  Because any room with you, you're so big and loud and talk a lot.  Why don't you just say Lynch so I can ask for the firing?  Just say it.  Just say it.  So that you.  All right, listen, if you're in a room, you're a majority.  You're never a minority.  I want to play something we got in yesterday.  It's a racial effect.  Hold on, hold on.  We're going to direct this ship, and then we're going to go.  All right, sorry.  Then we'll get crazy here. 
[01:14:30]  We got some audio yesterday.  Clemens admitting that he did the steroids.  Are you kidding?  Now, this has to be exclusive, because I really haven't heard this anywhere.  Yeah, for some reason, ESPN's not playing this yet.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  I wonder why.  It's shocking.  The fan here in New York, they're avoiding this.  But we got it.  Exclusive audio.  Clemens admitting the steroids.  Really?  Yeah, check this out.  I want to say thanks to this Mitchell report.  I've been getting emails and questions on this subject, and now the whole world knows the  answer is that I use steroids.  Over the last 15 days or so, when I played in Toronto for the Blue Jays, Brian Mack made 
[01:15:00]  use steroids to inject into my body.  And I'm very thankful for those steroids.  It's been extremely difficult to do this.  I'm almost numb to steroids and human growth hormones.  I'm angry about it, to be honest with you.  It's hurtful to have thousands of people to inject human growth hormones into my body.  My friends inject steroids into my body.  The New York Yankees to inject human growth hormones into my body. 
[01:15:30]  My children use drugs, and it means a lot to my family to inject steroids.  Again, it's amazing to me that I have to even use steroids.  And I want to say thanks to Brian McNamee, the New York Yankees.  After Christmas, I'm going to sit down with Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes, and I'll inject  drugs into my body.  Right there in front of him, and we'll do all this again.  And let me be clear, that I'm very thankful for those steroids. 
[01:16:00]  And Mike Wallace used drugs now that that's come out.  My children inject steroids into Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes.  I'm coming upon Christmas now, and I have been blessed in my life.  I've been blessed in my career.  And the answer is that I use steroids.  There you go.  Oh, is that funny?  Boy, they really spun that.  Yeah, that's not how I...  That is really wild.  I don't know how it got to where his children are injecting Mike Wallace with drugs.  But the filter, that's what he said, but by the time it gets filtered to you on, he has to... 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, yeah, it's completely different.  Totally murky.  Totally murky.  At least we had the uncut version.  Yeah, exactly.  Somebody had a little too much time on their hands.  I love that.  Do I believe...  Nah, no.  No?  He did something.  Just can't prove it.  Yeah.  It's just weird that that guy did it to...  Andy Pettit, who's like really Christian and stuff, I don't know, like he's done ads  for books about God on TV.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  So he just told the truth.  I'm ashamed and I'm sorry.  Did it like once and...  Yeah.  And he's...  To recover quickly.  And this guy, Brian McNamee, was introduced...  Clemens introduced him to Pettit and told Pettit, you've got to use this guy.  Yeah.  And so what?  This guy said to Pettit, listen, Roger doesn't do this steroid stuff, but you should.  You should.  This one time.  And I mean, I can't get Roger to do him.  It's weird.  Yeah.  He just won't do him.  Yeah.  He won't.  But you should do him. 
[01:17:30]  And Pettit was like, yeah, I mean, what a...  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  I'll try.  Yeah.  That accusing somebody of something is the thing that bothers me, but the thing that I  would think that gets me in terms of believing that he might did it is the argument of you  don't get better when you get 40.  Yeah, exactly.  Physically.  Yeah.  That's what all the Hall of Fame...  That's what Goose Gossage said.  Come on.  You're that old and you got better?  Yeah, he got better.  Like, Nolan Ryan was probably the last non-steroid older baseball guy, and he just managed to  sputter into his 40s a little bit. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Threw a no-hitter and then got out.  Yeah.  But Clemens...  When Clemens threw a piece of bat at Piazza, I was like, yeah, that guy's on drugs.  He's got mental problems from things that shouldn't be inside of him.  But he's doing the right thing as far as putting doubt in people's minds.  All you have to do with a situation like this, there's no proving it.  No.  There's no actual videotape.  There's not...  We love proof.  We love catching people red-hand these days. 
[01:18:30]  And there's none of that.  So all he has to do is say, look, I didn't do it.  And I'm going to sit down here.  I'm going to tell you how I didn't do it.  I'm going to do interviews saying I didn't do it.  And then people will go, you know, maybe he didn't.  The power of denial is unbelievable.  When I was a kid, I got caught.  I stole triple beam balances from my science class.  And I sold them to drug dealers for a pot.  I was in eighth grade.  I was like 12 years old.  All right.  I stole like 20 of them.  Because somehow I figured out how to get into the science. 
[01:19:00]  Anyway, I got caught.  And they just knew I did it.  And I just kept saying, no, I didn't.  Nope.  I kept saying, I didn't.  I don't even know what you're talking about.  No.  I don't even do drugs.  I don't smoke pot.  I just kept saying it.  And I just wore them down.  You ever watch it?  And they finally said, well, we can't really do it.  Why is that not working for Barry Bonds?  That's true, though.  If you just deny it.  Why is Barry Bonds getting ready to go to court for lying about something that you're saying  that no one can prove it?  All he's got to do is keep denying.  Keep denying.  No, but it's different because he's black. 
[01:19:30]  I didn't want to say that.  Let's be honest.  Of course, that's why.  Of course.  When black people deny anything, it's the opposite for black people.  Oh, right.  I forgot to tell you.  Black people, it's the opposite.  When they deny something, you go, oh, juice has been denied it for you.  Look at them lie.  Jesus, what a liar.  No, it's exactly.  All white people, we have to premise this whole thing.  All white people have to do.  Right.  Is deny.  And eventually people go, oh, come on.  Give them the benefit of the doubt.  Black people have to confess or else it's just going to get hot on you. 
[01:20:00]  If you watch any of those crime shows.  And they have to change the entire system.  But even if you didn't do it, you have to confess.  Even if you didn't do it, you should just say you didn't.  You know, I love those shows.  I love the crime shows on A&E where they show the confessions.  Right.  And they bring people in.  And a lot of times, the people that just stick to the denial, it goes into the cold case files  and maybe they get them 20 years later.  Yeah.  But it's the people that are sitting there and it's like, come on now.  Look, we got this, this, this. 
[01:20:30]  And they never really have anything.  Right.  But he goes, all right, yeah, okay, I was in the car when he was shot.  And then before you know it, the guy was like, I shot the man.  I killed him.  Exactly.  And then problem solved.  Crime solved.  Just deny it.  Yeah, but the more you say, you have to just say no.  No.  Yeah, I know, but it is true.  No.  No.  Because the more you talk, they're going to get you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the cops.  I was with this lady one time that you pay to give your back rubs in L.A.  Okay.  And as soon as we were done, I actually just put my sneaker on. 
[01:21:00]  Knock, knock, knock.  Cops right at the door.  And they came in and they had me.  They took me on the curb.  They just started going, come on, man.  What was going on there?  Were you just getting a better way?  They need, the only reason they're asking is because they need you to say yes.  But they kept asking me.  They have nothing on you right there.  I just kept going, nope.  Nope.  No.  No.  No.  But they would get me to like buddy, buddy.  Like, ah, well, I mean, we were.  And I was like, no.  No.  And they finally were like, look, he's not saying anything.  And they let me go. 
[01:21:30]  They were pissed too.  Of course they were.  But that really is the difference between life for whites and blacks.  If you're white and you kill somebody on television, as long as you just keep denying it, you're  going to get out of it.  Yeah.  If you're black and you were home sleeping and someone 4,000 miles away got killed and  they ask you if you did it, you better just say you did it.  Just confess.  They're going to hang it on you.  Unless Monk is around.  I was driving through a questionable area one time where there were prostitutes.  And let's just say I had glasses many, many years ago.  Let's just say there was a transsexual who walked over and snatched my glasses. 
[01:22:00]  And I was sitting there.  Why does she want your glasses?  Was that?  Why does she want your glasses?  Thank you for at least sheeing it up.  And I was sitting there.  It's out of respect for her.  I'm respecting her choice.  I was sitting there.  And let's just say I couldn't drive because I couldn't see.  And I saw a police car.  Oh, God.  And I saw a police car.  And I had to high beam the police car and say, he took my glasses.  And the policeman had to walk over and go, did you take his glasses? 
[01:22:30]  Oh, my God.  And this person had to go, yes.  And the policeman had to say, give the glasses back.  Oh, my God.  Because the policeman said, what are you doing around here?  I said, I'm lost.  You lost and a tranny stole your glasses?  Stole them right off my face.  Right through the window.  Why did she steal them?  I have no idea.  He was mad at you for something.  Why did he steal them?  Let's just.  Yeah, come on.  Let's stop this.  Let's stop humoring him.  Why did that man with breasts steal your glasses?  Why did that gentleman? 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  I actually don't know.  They're crazy.  They carry razors soaked in garlic.  I don't know.  What?  Not emotionally healthy people.  Why garlic?  The genitals of both sexes.  Why garlic?  Because Norton looks like Nosferatu.  They have their genitals duct taped.  Was there a conversation going on?  No.  Yes, it was.  Oh, thank you, Opie.  Just stop.  The window is down.  There was something going on.  Can we have an intervention about this little homosexual?  No, no, no.  I'll tell you.  I was at a stop sign.  It was in the meatpacking district.  There was a bunch of trannies. 
[01:23:30]  A stop sign?  At the meatpacking district.  Yes.  Okay, fair enough.  Of course I was riding around looking at hordes, but I wasn't talking to this one.  I didn't see it coming.  Oh, so just an arbitrary hooker that happened to be a dude just came and took your little  glasses off your face.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  I just snatched it and kicked it off my face.  A girl walked up that looked like Daryl Strawberry, and you just started talking to her.  Nobody would talk to her.  I'm going to tell you what happened.  Norton had one of those little tirades that he has if Kenny's around, but he forgot Kenny  wasn't there, and a big transvestite stole your glasses. 
[01:24:00]  First of all, transvestite is different.  You don't want to be lumped in with Haitians.  They don't want to be lumped in with...  Oh, my God.  A little respect.  A little respect for this.  Oh, damn it, Norton.  Transsexual.  That's the one before I ever heard of Kenny.  That's before I even did comedy.  He cursed the tranny out for something.  Yeah, something went on.  My glasses got taken off.  He doesn't want to share it.  Why would they just reach into your window and take your glasses?  Yeah, because I wouldn't... 
[01:24:30]  I'll tell you what it was.  There you go.  I wasn't buying.  It was a very aggressive salesman.  It was, yes.  Who was leaning and going, come on, I swear this would be a good experience for you.  It was somebody that goes, you're looking...  And you're going, no, thank you.  Because you were looking for something prettier.  I was not going to pick up.  You don't understand how my addiction works.  You were trying to actually get some meat.  You were trying to get some steaks at the meatpacking district.  Yes, I was riding around looking for...  It was a huge misunderstanding.  No, because I wasn't picking up, and that's what it was about.  It was just, she got annoyed and snaps.  It was like that fast. 
[01:25:00]  I had no communication with this person whatsoever.  None.  And I had to tell the police.  She took my glasses.  And the police had to get some.  And they said, get back the glasses.  There you go, Coke Logic.  There's your next animation.  Yeah, please.  I just visualized that one.  I'd love to see that one.  Hey, we got to take a quick...  Oh, Magoo.  You've done it again.  You couldn't see.  Do you know what it's like to sit in your car in a sea of men in dressings?  And not be able to drive away?  Sir?  Ah, ah.  I can't go anywhere.  You've got bad eyesight, folks.  Sir? 
[01:25:30]  A blurry thing stole my glasses.  Ah, Magoo.  I'll ask this nice young lady if she could help me.  Confused, self-hating blur.  You just had to sit there until you got your glasses back.  That's horrendous.  Hey, quick break.  We got a break.  And when we get back, we'll get into the Dr. Phil thing.  Because we got a lot of people in the studio that do the Xbox.  And, you know, it's being used to yell and scream racist stuff.  And Dr. Phil is tackling this very important issue. 
[01:26:00]  As we go to break, our homeless friend, Tippi Tom.  Most of you guys know Tippi Tom.  He came in and we had him do a little books on tape for everybody.  So check this out as we go to break.  The Opie and Anthony Institute of Art and Literature is proud to present a collection of books on tape  soulfully voiced by the homeless, Tippi Tom.  I can't do as good as a guy to do it, but you know.  Masterpieces like Herman Melville's Moby Dick. 
[01:26:30]  Call me a smile.  Some years ago.  Never mind how long precisely.  And Dickens historically themed A Tale of Two Cities.  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.  It was the age of wisdom.  Doing a good job.  Okay.  You won't believe your ears as Tom mutters and fumbles his way through Mark Twain's classic, 
[01:27:00]  Huck Finn.  Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was under the window, Douglas's protection.  Okay.  I guess I'm getting around.  And then be prepared to have your breath taken away.  Literally.  With his read of Great Expectations.  Heaven knows we'd never be ashamed of our tears. 
[01:27:30]  Okay.  Of course not.  Anyway, I think I got silver right.  And finally, you'll enjoy the classic for all ages, Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham.  Great eggs and ham.  No, green eggs and ham.  See, I thought you can't see where my glasses are.  I am Sam.  I am Sam.  Sam, I am.  Come on, man.  I got my damn glasses on.  Who even knew Tippi Tom had glasses?  No.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[01:28:00]  It's a collection of some of the finest literature ever written and then read by a homeless drunk.  Order Tippi Tom Books on Tape today.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Let me set the scene here.  It's a very, very, very busy morning.  We got Patrice O'Neill on the couch.  We got Bob Kelly on the couch.  We got Louis C.K. to my right.  We got Basil Tees in the corner making omelets for everybody.  And we got English Gavin, who's 6'5", 290 pounds. 
[01:28:30]  Not a hint of fat on his body.  He's got the binoculars and he's checking out the girl exercising naked.  And he's uncut.  He's uncut.  Bob Kelly needs to answer that.  I'm taking a sauna with him.  Hey, Gavin, how's it going out?  How's it going out the window this morning?  Yeah, that mic's not on.  Why would it be?  Why would it be?  Why would that microphone be on?  It needs to be that one?  Okay.  Gavin, what are you seeing out the window?  I've seen nothing right now.  She's still wearing clothes.  And unfortunately, she's trying to read a magazine and whatnot. 
[01:29:00]  But she's really teasing me.  Yeah, she does get naked.  I want to club over that fence and just...  What about the naked chicks in the magazine?  Oh, actually, she actually has, yeah.  Gavin, we've seen her naked many, many times.  You're not missing much.  Is she a white girl?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, Gavin loves white girls.  He's going to do the blade jump right over to that.  The blade jump. 
[01:29:30]  He did a girl over my apartment, my girlfriend's best friend.  He came over, romanced her in like four hours, and then that night just blasted her on my couch.  The girl fell in love with him.  This white girl from Boston fell in love with this black Englishman, and he dumped her.  And he's such a Viking.  He's just probably a Viking.  Me and Dawn, we were holding each other in the bed like, oh my God, like there was a monster attacking her. 
[01:30:00]  And he drank out of his helmet and left.  It was a bad guy.  He drank out of her skull.  He just blasted her.  You were scared for your life, what you were hearing?  We were just holding each other like, she's going to be okay, honey.  She's like, go out there and help her.  I'm not going out there.  It's Gavin.  He's uncut.  He'll grab me with that thing and throw me like an elephant.  It's prehensile.  His big English jam, he looks like a pug's face.  Are we friends? 
[01:30:30]  Of course.  That was a compliment.  Yes.  And then we got to get back to Jimmy, too.  The instant feedback everybody's pointing out.  I completely forgot.  Especially Steven S. from Bayshore.  You've got to give Josh from Ohio some credit as well.  And Kevin from Connecticut also saying the same thing, that the tranny in that situation  you described.  Yeah, I completely forgot.  I've told the story.  And what happened, I've been riding around in the circle, and the tranny did say, for  wasting my time, because I wouldn't stop.  That's why she took his glasses.  And my shoes.  So I completely forgot about that. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, it was awful.  Officer, I need my glasses back.  The gentleman dressed like a woman took them from me, and I can't see, god damn it.  You must have been pathetic.  No, no, that makes you feel really good.  I tried to drive away, but I hit something with a penis.  Oh, you know, every good gentleman has a fault.  And just when you thought the show couldn't get any crazier, we got Howie Mandel standing 
[01:31:30]  by.  He's on the phone here.  Howie.  Yes.  How are you, buddy?  Have you reached the guest quota yet?  Well, I think this is the most mics we've had on in a very long time.  That worked.  But we wanted to squeeze you in there, Howie.  Thanks.  It's an honor to be part of this extravaganza.  Yeah, it is an extravaganza.  We got a girl ready to be naked and exercising across the way.  Does she know she's going to be on the radio?  She will.  You know what, Howie?  See, this girl knows that people are looking at her because she has no shades, no blinds. 
[01:32:00]  Every morning.  Yeah, keeps it open.  Every morning, it's the same routine.  She takes all her clothes off.  She jumps on an exercise bike, which isn't doing any help whatsoever.  She's got a big ass, and she's not really into shaving.  She's naked on an exercise bike?  Every morning.  Every morning without fail.  Well, then it's not about the exercise if she's sitting on one of those seats peddling.  You said there's a seat.  Yeah, there's no seat.  It's not about losing weight. 
[01:32:30]  No.  Just smelling up the seat.  And then she goes and she showers.  She comes back down naked, hangs out for a while a little more naked.  And, you know, no blinds.  Goes in the closet.  Every single light in her apartment is on.  She's not trying to hide anything.  You know what?  She does have blinds.  It's just that they're pointed so that if you look...  Like, you don't think about when you have blinds, you don't think about the people that are above you looking down through the slats.  But you've got to alert her.  It would be great to alert her live on the air, which is next time she's naked on the bike, send somebody down to buzz the apartment. 
[01:33:00]  Well, we've got to figure out which apartment it is somehow.  I think that Balloon Glove Howie could have talked about this more in depth, but Deal or No Deal Howie can't do that.  No.  Deal or No Deal Howie.  This is dangerous territory for Deal or No Deal Howie.  I can do this.  I'm in town doing live, you know, Saturday and Sunday.  I'm at Westbury Music Fair, and I'm at the Bergen County Theater in Englewood, New Jersey.  I'm filthy.  It's not the Deal or No Deal.  Hold on. 
[01:33:30]  I'm going to back up Howie.  He's been on our show ever since the Deal or No Deal has become huge, and he's told us some horrific things.  Really?  Tonight he's actually on Monk.  His Monk episode airs tonight.  Right.  But that's not filthy.  That's me ridding Tony Shalhoub of his need to wipe his hands.  That's who they hired me.  Yeah.  It is.  Hey, Howie, you wouldn't want to be in the studio, by the way.  I'm getting over the flu.  Patrice has it.  Jimmy's been sneezing all week.  Anthony's had a couple sneezes going on the last few days. 
[01:34:00]  Bob Kelly's ugly.  Bob Kelly's ugly.  But I just bought a bidet.  Yeah, but Bob Kelly told us about his bidet, and we were bragging about yours yesterday, Howie.  I told you about that toilet, right?  Yeah, of course you did.  It's not only a bidet.  You don't touch anything.  No.  You don't touch toilet paper anymore.  No, nothing.  Have you ever had a cold?  Wow.  Yes.  I get sicker more than any.  I get more.  So what's your point?  Wait a minute.  How do you use a bidet to wipe everything?  No, no, no, no, no.  This has a...  Does it have acid in it?  What if you have a really sticky poo? 
[01:34:30]  No, power wash.  Power wash?  Really?  You just blast it?  It's added on power wash and then blow dry.  Those foam strips like a car wash come out and just voom, voom, voom, voom, voom, lather it  up and wax it.  I don't know if I told you last time I accidentally hit the button that said front wash, and it  was like one of those speed bags.  It's $1,000, that toilet seat.  Way more than that.  No, it's not the seat.  I got the whole...  I got the Nearest 600.  It's like five grand.  I got all the... 
[01:35:00]  I go...  I walk into the bathroom at night.  I don't even have to touch the light.  The seat automatically raises, and there's a beautiful glow...  A light comes out.  You know who you are, Howie?  You were the old man from the original Creep Show.  What?  Remember the roach guy?  Yeah.  All the roaches?  They creep up on you.  Yeah, they creep up on you.  Bugs.  I don't touch nothing.  You got to touch something, Howie.  No, I touch nothing.  I go through life touching nothing.  And then not only that, as soon as you sit down, it's like a warm...  The seat is heated to its... 
[01:35:30]  I have that.  You have that.  I have that.  Yeah, well, Bob Kelly's got the cheap version of Howie has it.  First of all, he's got deal or no deal money.  I got Caroline's three-show money.  Bob Kelly's seat you have to heat with matches.  It's just what I save on toilet paper alone.  It's worth it.  I don't even use toilet paper anymore.  So it's like the bidet from France.  Japan, I think.  It's different reasons, though.  Bob wants comfortable craps because, like me, every time he takes a dump, it's an emergency.  Because we both have bad diets, and things come violently rocketing out of our asses. 
[01:36:00]  And so we need at least to be comfortable during the trauma.  We give birth every time we poop.  Howie is crazy and has mental problems and he can't touch this.  So I made it a whole, I made it a whole, it's kind of, for me, it's like a hobby now.  Right.  I mean, I took the, I got a flat screen TV I put in right in front of it.  I got that.  And I put a phone.  And Ted Bundy's hobby was killing nurses.  How much does it cost to Howie install that?  The what?  The toilet?  Yeah, like the install, you know, the whole plumber thing. 
[01:36:30]  Honestly, I think I was exaggerating.  I think the whole thing is like three grand totally installed.  Yeah.  Poor Howie.  Every time he comes on our show, he has to talk about his germs and his toilet.  The toilet is fascinating.  Howie.  That's my life.  Yeah.  Howie, do you find yourself sitting on the toilet longer and longer every day?  Absolutely.  Like, I was like, I'm getting addicted to the feeling of it cleaning me.  My life revolves around crapping since I got this toilet.  That's my schedule and then I fit everything around it. 
[01:37:00]  Hey, can I tell a Howie related story, by the way?  Yes.  Howie, this is Louis C.K.  Remember?  I remember you, Louis.  I'm a huge fan.  Well, Howie, he took me to open for him a few gigs and we were in Poughkeepsie at the  Howling, whatever it is there.  Yes.  Yeah.  So, they gave us the Motel 8 or whatever as a dressing room and I went, Howie didn't,  you know, he just ate dinner and stayed and then we left.  But I went to the dressing room and the Motel 8 people had created this presidential suite 
[01:37:30]  for Howie.  Like, they must have gone out and gotten special furniture.  And there was a gift basket and there was a note saying, the owner of the hotel loves  Howie more than anything and would love a picture with him and we did this room just  for you and I'd look at this stuff and I didn't, I just was like, screw him and I didn't tell  Howie.  You never told him.  Never told him.  Never told him.  Like, I just, I was in a bad mood.  I was bitter for some reason.  Probably because I was opening for Howie Mandel at the Howling Wolf in Poughkeepsie.  The Laughing Wolf. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, and I just didn't tell anybody.  You weren't bitter enough to trash the room and write back, fuck you.  Excuse me.  That's all right.  Oh yeah, hoops.  Ah, well.  How much side were on?  Are you any better?  Howie.  I don't know, am I talking on, is this.  No, this is regular radio.  Are you any better with the germs now or is it the same thing?  Why, like, within three months, how did I get cured?  No.  Oh no, but any better.  Is there any progress at all?  No.  No.  What did you hear I was doing that would enhance the progress? 
[01:38:30]  Nothing.  I just figured that we've talked about it, now we're talking about it again, so maybe  you had progressed a little bit.  Would you be more uncomfortable if a black man or a white man licked your face?  Let's just get down to the nitty gritty.  Black man, because there would be a home invasion happening.  No, but Howie, do you go, do you get counseling for it or anything?  Yeah, I'm constantly.  My therapist lives in a beautiful gated community. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  It's a, yes, I'm in cognitive therapy now.  And you're married, right?  Cognitive.  Yes.  You've got kids, right?  So here's the question.  Three kids.  I have, I sit, I will sit, some therapy sessions are just sitting there shaking hands.  So you're married, Howie.  Now, here's the question.  Raw, Diggy?  You know, raw?  Raw?  I mean, I'm saying, you know.  Do you wear a condom with your wife?  Yeah, you go raw.  Yeah, I don't shake her hand.  Yes, I go raw, yeah.  All right, I'm just checking. 
[01:39:30]  That doesn't bug you?  No, no.  You do it like a hot seed through a sheet or something?  Are you like a surgeon when you have sex?  And on Halloween, my kids go out as one-eyed ghosts.  One bloody-eyed ghost.  Oh, God.  One-eyed cyclops ghost has pink eyes. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, man.  Wow.  Trying to get most of this on the radio, by the way.  That's so funny.  Come on.  That's really funny.  It's so indirect.  It takes you so much work to get to the bad thought there.  Hey, Howie, still loving Deal and No Deal.  And like I said, every time you come on our show,  it's because of you.  I mean, it's such a dumb concept, but I watch.  Oh, every time I go, I cannot watch it.  I have to watch it.  I watch because of Howie,  because somehow he just makes it work.  I don't get it.  We're in the middle of a million-dollar mission now, 
[01:40:30]  and hopefully somebody's going to walk out of there with a million.  That's the mission.  Every time somebody doesn't win a million,  we're adding another case with a million.  And we're going to do it up to 57 cases.  Jesus.  Wow.  Howie, that show made me cry once.  Why?  It really did make me cry.  Teary-eyed?  Yes.  It was a Marine.  Somebody win?  It was like a Marine who came over from,  he just came back from the war,  and he had like two days here in New York.  And they mentioned he couldn't see his family.  There wasn't time to go to California to see them. 
[01:41:00]  So he's in his moment where he's going to see his kids come out,  and his wife, he didn't know they weren't coming.  Oh, yeah.  So everybody's crying.  And then that moment that he hits that every idiot on that show hits,  where you've got...  Or it's time to walk away.  You've got 150.  It's always like at 125,000.  Yeah, right.  That basically, if you're in your living room, you're like,  there's $125,000 in front of you,  and you're saying no, you piece...  You just garbage human being.  But at that point...  But he hit that point, and he said to his kids, 
[01:41:30]  like everyone was screaming,  you know, no deal!  And he said to his little girls,  he said, you see what's happening here?  $125,000, and there's like whatever,  there's a one in four chance that...  The odds are really good that I'll get more.  And I'm not going to gamble with your futures that way.  And he took me, he said,  I just started bawling.  The thing that's great about that show, though,  is that everyone screens no deal.  Everyone wants it.  But then the second the person takes the deal,  thank God, thank God, thank God. 
[01:42:00]  We're all crazy.  Thank God you're not crazy.  Can I...  I want to see a disaster.  One that bothers me along the same lines was  there was a...  We had a woman on whose husband was in Iraq,  and we went live to Fallujah.  The guy's in the battlefield,  and we're looking at him with night vision goggles.  And, you know, he's just a young kid,  he's out there,  he's in the worst part of wherever the war was going on,  and she had gotten to a point where  there wasn't much left on the board,  I don't remember,  and the offer was six figures, 
[01:42:30]  which would have changed the life.  And she goes, honey, what should I do?  And from Fallujah,  you know, we have a horrible signal,  he says, take the money, honey,  just take the money.  And then the satellite went out.  We lost the guy.  And she goes, you know what?  He doesn't know.  No deal.  We lost everything and went home with a buck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he must have...  What a bitch.  He must have beat her savagely.  When I do it home,  when it gets to the figure Louis was talking about, 
[01:43:00]  $100,000, $125,000,  and they don't take that money,  you want them to take that money.  And as soon as they say, no deal,  now you go the other way,  and you're like, man,  I hope he gets a dollar.  I got to watch now  and watch him lose it all.  Well, the Marine that took the money,  the Marine that took the money,  what was the next case?  Do you remember that show, Howie,  that Marine?  I don't remember the Marine.  He was so good.  Louis, what was after that?  Do you remember?  I don't remember,  but it was a great...  I don't remember that part of it  where then they break his heart  that he could have had more.  Look at Anthony.  Look at Anthony like,  this sissy talk. 
[01:43:30]  No, I watched the show.  I'm betting until I lose.  He's like,  all his betting.  No, I probably would be  totally different on those game shows.  Howie, do you remember  the Chinese guy  who had come here with $75?  I love that.  No, that's $750.  Yeah, he came here with $750.  Yeah, the Korean guy.  And he was an immigrant,  and so now this is his family  playing the show.  Well, he said that,  you know,  his family came from Korea  with one bag with $750 in it  and two kids.  So Chase the American Dream, 
[01:44:00]  and these two Korean couples  put their kids through school  and college,  and now the kid was just getting married  and he's on a game show.  He says,  I made it.  It all started with $750,  and I made it.  And he starts playing the game,  and then as luck would have it,  all that's left on the board  is $750,000,  $75,000,  and $750.  It's just weird.  And then the offer comes in.  The offer's like $300-something thousand dollars,  and he says deal.  He takes the deal.  But it was amazing that he'd started with $750,000, 
[01:44:30]  his father,  $750,000,  $75,000,  and $750,000.  The numbers look great.  I said,  let's see if you made a good deal.  Had you said no deal to the $350,000,  what would your next choice be?  As he opens the next case,  $750,000 is revealed.  So he got out at the perfect time.  And then we open up his case  to see what he had sold.  He sold his case for $350,000.  We open his case,  and his case that he started the game with  was a case holding $750,000. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, the same amount of money.  Just like he came over.  But there was a moment of heroin.  But there was a moment in that show  when they had revealed all that  where the old man was crying.  The old man was crying.  The old man breaks into crying.  He's sitting down there.  The old man breaks crying.  I take the case with the $750,  and I walk it down in the audience,  and I put it back in his lap.  That's right.  But here's the thing.  He was crying.  I think I've ever saw.  Which was what?  I said, that, ladies and gentlemen,  is the circle of life.  Jesus Christ.  Here's the thing.  I saw a woman on Price is Right  break her back doing Plinko. 
[01:45:30]  I cried.  I had a totally different view  of that show, though,  because that guy was crying.  He didn't say a word the whole time  because he doesn't speak English.  He's crying at the end,  and everyone's standing and applauding.  And I thought,  and it was supposed to be  because of how great this is,  but I thought the guy was crying  because look what materialistic douchebags  my family have turned into.  Yeah, he's all upset.  My whole struggle,  yes, he was like,  my whole life struggle was a waste  because these people have no values,  and they just chased me.  On a game show when I came here. 
[01:46:00]  Louie, Louie,  do you care about any black people,  any black stories on there?  What's that?  Some kid from Compton  that lost his Air Force One.  No, I don't care.  Any black cry stories?  No, no.  Any black kid came in and stole all the cases  and ran off of them?  That's what?  Any black kids stole that card  with the money on it  thinking it was worth something?  He stole the case thinking  he could actually spend that money.  Hey, Howie,  the other thing I like,  and you guys don't do it all the time, 
[01:46:30]  but you show the case going into commercial  so the people at home  know exactly what's in the case  before the guy makes his decision.  You like that?  I didn't like that as much.  I kind of like that.  Oh, okay.  I'll give them the note.  It doesn't matter, I guess.  Opie liked this.  I guess what I like about the show,  you're always throwing a different twist into it.  We are.  And the theme shows and all that.  The banker,  doesn't he just say,  hey, Howie,  suck my blank or something?  Doesn't he just say,  yeah, right?  Yeah, it's all set up way in advance. 
[01:47:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He really has the offers.  But it doesn't take him that long  to just save the money.  He just says,  hey, Howie.  He either tries to throw me  or he says horribly disgusting stuff  about the contestant.  Tell that fat, smelly pig  that I'll give her $50,000  for a case with maggots in it.  Not too far off.  Yeah, because it gets boring for you guys.  I don't know if you watched the other day,  but he actually, 
[01:47:30]  some woman had as a lucky charm  her little girl's piggy bank.  And he took it  and I thought he was going to take it.  He actually smashed it.  Oh my God, he did?  He smashed it?  And I thought he was faking it.  He actually smashed  this little girl's piggy bank.  And this woman's game  just went down the toilet.  I mean, he is evil.  That's great.  Yeah.  All right, Howie.  So what do we got?  You're going to be on Regis.  You're hosting today, right?  Yeah, I'm there now.  So I got to go run.  Oh.  And I'm hosting  and I'll be at the Bergen Theater  on Sunday 
[01:48:00]  and on Saturday  at Westbury Music Fair.  Where the hell's Regis  that he couldn't be there?  I have no idea.  He's very angry.  I'll find out.  I'll find out.  Hey, good to talk to you guys again.  Louie, great to talk to you.  Yeah, Howie, take it easy.  Okay.  All right, Howie Mandela, everyone.  Got to take a quick break.  We're going to get into  the Dr. Phil thing  with the Xbox being racist.  I want to hear this.  Yeah, we got to squeeze that in  before we get out of here.  But first, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling  the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch  of F.U.s.  You have six new voice messages.

[01:49:30]  and I'm sick about  hearing about your  caucuses.  Suck my f***.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony  F.U. line  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Right back into it.  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy arguing with Tom  down the hall.  Patrice O'Neal.  Oh yeah.  Always the argument.  Playing governors  on Long Island all weekend.  We got Bob Kelly  playing Carolines  all weekend  here in New York City. 
[01:50:00]  We got Louis C.K.  Where are you going  to be again, Louis?  You know what?  February 14th.  What's that holiday?  Valentine's Day.  Valentine's Day.  This is a big  Opie and Anthony weekend  for me.  St. Valentine's Day  I'm in Buffalo.  Nice.  And then the next night  I'm in Cleveland.  The next night  Michigan, Detroit.  There you go.  So that's all  you guys' stuff.  I'll be back obviously  to plug those.  But they're all going  on sale like today.  They took us off  the air in Detroit.  They did?  Not on the satellite  on the thrusters.  So they're still  being heard in Detroit.  Actually the satellite 
[01:50:30]  audience in the Detroit area,  huge.  Well we,  it has to be  because I almost,  I mean we went on the air  and we're almost sold out.  I mean we went on sale  and I know that's all  O&A people.  There's no way  that anybody in Detroit  cares about me  except for for the show.  Lucky Louie?  Yeah but it's just Detroit.  Like I went on sale  a bunch of markets  and Detroit just went  through the roof immediately.  I think it has to be  from you guys.  It's a huge satellite market.  We noticed that  this past summer.  So you got anything  accomplished down the hall  there Jimmy?  No I mean there was  a couple of the dumps. 
[01:51:00]  I know why they did them  and there was one particular  that bugged me.  So I talked to Tom  and he was in the room  when it was dumped  and he told him to dump it.  I still don't 100% agree  with it but I do understand  when he went through  the progression of why  he felt it should be dumped  it's like alright  I mean we're not going  to win every battle  and that one I can kind of go  alright I understand  his thinking.  I think Tom's hanging  in the dump room today  knowing that everybody's  in today.  Yeah.  Tom's a smart guy  when it comes to that.  He went progressively  through his thinking  and I was like alright  whatever.  I think you guys 
[01:51:30]  got him frazzled.  Yeah.  He's working extra hard.  Hey Dr. Phil  we're going to try  to get this on  before we get out of here.  Dr. Phil talks about  racist Xbox  and cyber bullying.  Racist Xbox?  Well this was something  we were talking about  yesterday.  I bought an Xbox  and I don't see any racism  going on on the  I would have to deny that too.  Jesus.  They're all playing  Call of Duty  Call of Duty 4  and you know  you get the trash talk  but it gets a little ugly  in those rooms. 
[01:52:00]  Does it?  Dr. Phil kind of wants  to maybe put a stop to this.  How is he going to  put a stop to it?  Wait a minute  so this isn't something  that's in the Xbox  it's stuff that kids  are saying to each other  while they're playing.  Kids.  Adults.  Well say me and Anthony  were in a room.  Right.  It's me and Anthony  were in a room  and then the other  team comes in after.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then the guy  from the other team  the first thing  out of his mouth is  yo we're going to  kick your asses  you know  then some stuff  sometimes  some people say  some stuff after that. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah it gets really  it can get racist  and homophobic  also even though  we're not  but that's like saying  like two guys  a guy goes up to  a guy on the street  and calls him a Jew  or whatever  and then  so they go  we've got to  take that street down.  Right.  That's basically  what it is  it's just  pretty much  that's what he's saying.  Just another meeting place  for people to act  awful towards each other.  Yeah while they're  playing a game.  Yeah but it's got  nothing to do with  Xbox.  That's a damn good point man.  No it's just another  communication vehicle.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  It is ridiculous.  It's just that white people  will call black people  those words  if they can do it  from a safe distance.  Yeah.  Of course.  I'll tell you what happens.  We're in a living room.  I'll tell you what happens.  We play Call of Duty 4  which is one of the best games ever  and Bobby Kelly here  came up with  General Bobby Kelly  came up with the clan name.  They call them clans by the way.  That doesn't help.  No offense.  It's like a team  and ours is  G-A-A-Y 
[01:53:30]  so it's you know  team gay  with two gays  and so in front of your name  in little brackets  it says G-A-A-Y  and that way you know  that we're all on one team.  So the second we get in a room  with another team  they just instantly start  and it's just nothing  but homophobic.  It's so stupid  because you guys  are owning it.  Like you're going out  and calling yourselves gay  We're calling ourselves the gay  and they're acting like  you only didn't notice  that it's spelled gay.  That it's spelled gay. 
[01:54:00]  It doesn't help  that we're like  hey guys  Yeah yeah  we greet them  when they come into the rooms  that way.  That must make them so mad.  And they get very angry  and people don't want to play us  and if there are teams  because there are teams  then of specifically  Jewish guys  there's the Jews  their name of the team  is Jews  and they'll play  and there's certain  black teams  that'll play  and so it turns into  all of that  It just turns into  gay bashing 
[01:54:30]  and racial bashing  back and forth  So Dr. Phil wants  to punish  the game  And he's right  Dr. Phil is right  Let's find out  And the greatest part  about it is  the fact that  you're saying these things  which is fine  but you're playing a game  that is probably  the most violent game  I've ever played  in my life  It's fantastically violent  I love it  And it shouldn't be  any other way  but you are blowing  people up  Yeah but don't call them  a faggot  Yeah yeah  Don't say that  Perish the thought  Really? 
[01:55:00]  Oh they probably  would have a problem  with that  I shouldn't be  on this show  The thing that stinks  about the game  the game is so  politically correct  that we're actually  still fighting Russians  Right  It's the only acceptable enemy  It just went to Russians  too  We actually were still  fighting Germans  up until last year  Now we're actually  fighting Russians  Germans are always  the bad guys  With laser scopes  Which we didn't even  fight them with laser scopes  Even though we fought  we fought Korea  between those two  You can't do Koreans  And you can't do  But wait a minute 
[01:55:30]  What about  Germans and Russians  are the only white enemies  we've had  in the last 100 years  There are Arabs in there  I played a few games  That's what I'm located  Arabs are the hardest  board  Arabs and Asians  are the hardest  boards on video games now  Russians are very easy  to beat now  That's because  they have Chinese stars  and nunchucks  What are people  going to learn though  that it's not about  Xbox  Nothing's going to  You can't change  racism through  Nothing's going to  change until 
[01:56:00]  Two tin cans  and a string  That's strong  between a black guy  and a white guy  You're just going to  get trapped  Black people  have to stop  stealing  and gay people  have to stop  hurting God  And Jews have to  stop manipulating  the media  And then that  You've got to get  to the root of the problem  As soon as anybody  but black people  admit that there's  racism  No it's  It's going to  stop  but we're all  the same color  It's like we're  the  We think racism  is the boogeyman  or the Loch Ness monster  Nobody white ever says  Exactly 
[01:56:30]  Unless it's a joking  man  Exactly  I remember when  Venus and Serena Williams  complained that they get  racist attitudes thrown  at them on tour  People yell stuff  at them during  matches and stuff  And so they asked  Hingis  Martina Hingis  the Swiss player  That's as white  as it gets  The Swiss  And she said  I'm on the same tour  and I don't see  the racism  They don't really  They reserve it  for the  Williams sisters  Those Williams sisters 
[01:57:00]  Just because they  call you nigglet  doesn't mean anything  Let's see what  Dr. Phil has to say  on this subject  He did a whole show  on this yesterday  with the Xbox  I love playing video games  as much as I like  eating food  I've been a loyal  customer of Xbox Live  and Xbox 360  Now it's gotten worse  with the ratio slurs  the name calling  and the bullying online  I've been calling you monkey  or your hands greasy  from eating all that chicken  I'm going to put a lynch  on your door  or is that your  kids in the background 
[01:57:30]  So I had to stop my children  from playing online games  My 10 year old daughter  my 13 year old son  and even my 5 year old son  and he asked me  Daddy why I can't  play online with you  I want to play that  and I go no  but he goes why  they're going to  call me names  and I think that's sad  for a 5 year old  to even know that  Oh boy  here we are  You have your kids  playing video games  you crappy parents  Have they played  and you're looking at each other  like whoops  Have they played against  Team K?  Sorry  I didn't mean it  I think they're talking  about you guys 
[01:58:00]  You're like  Oh that was mine  Oh boy  That greasy chicken  I didn't know he was black  I thought he was just  cooking chicken  I just thought he played poorly  The control is slipping  out of your hand  obviously  Oh my god  It was Erd Lee  I was calling him cheap  Wow  Well you know what  the internet  that type of thing  is just basically  a CB radio  Yeah  I mean  it's you talking  to a bunch of guys  you don't know  where they are  You can't see them either 
[01:58:30]  so you don't know  what color they are  or religion  or anything like that  You can't tell my voice  Sometimes you can  When their clan name  is DMX  The last fashion of racism  Boy y'all are trying  to find any way  to do it  I know  I know  You can't do it  out in the open  no more  Every time there's  a new technology  porn and racism  is the biggest thing  to come out of it  Thank god  Why are you people  just trying to find  different ways  to be racist  It's just bothering  And you take this away  Think all the technology 
[01:59:00]  we have to invent  to be more racist  We're not that good  at anything else  We're amazing at that  What do you mean we're?  I don't understand  why you keep  grouping yourself in  Spick  You're a red headed  um  plumber  You're a farmer  Yeah but see  that's the thing  Don't pick my spinach  Stop with the weed  You're an albino Mexican  But that's how  that's how powerful  that's how powerful 
[01:59:30]  whiteness is  that it transcends  Mexicanness  It does purify  everything  It does  You can be born in Africa  of African black parents  and be named  Mumbamba  If you're white  you know  come on  join the  health club  you know  join the club  get to the front  of the bus  my friend  I don't care where you're from  Black president  no way  in hell  You know how many arguments  I've had with my girlfriend  over racist remarks  I make  She can't believe  I make them  She's like  would you say that  in front of Patrice  Well yeah 
[02:00:00]  in front of me  Of course  Not most  By the way  Gavin  No  She must hate me then  By the way  Patrice  You just hate me  What Patrice called  Louis got dumped  You know  He just can't  What?  Did I really?  Yeah  But I was calling  Louis that  and he said  Okay  It's just ridiculous  That's a bad one  On behalf of all Mexicans  I accept the phrase  Yeah whatever  Let's play more  Dr. Phil audio here  Only if you put  N-Span  I do though  feel for anybody  Oh my god  You should be hit  with a brick  But that was funny  At least now 
[02:00:30]  everyone knows  what the hell  we were talking about  N-Span  Alright listen  Here we go  Gamer's wife  tells Dr. Phil  why she is concerned  about this racist  stuff going on  online  So you're worried  that he's going  to maybe draw  these people  into the real world  I just  you know Dr. Phil  I just feel like  in the internet  in this situation  anything is possible  I don't know  who these people are  they're claiming  to be the KKK  and I have a real  big problem with that  You know  they're calling  my children monkeys  that they're going  to hang them  they're going  to kill them  they're going  to kill me  It's crazy 
[02:01:00]  and it's out of control  and nobody is trying  to do anything  about this  My husband  has contacted  Microsoft  for many years  and I don't understand  why the FBI  is not all over  the desk  Maybe they should  look for you know  people that want  to fly planes  into buildings  Leave the FBI  alone  They shouldn't  be after Xbox  You're talking  about the same  thing that you  get on the computer  internet cowards  they're called  They just get  on there  bash people  they're nameless  and faceless  and have no courage 
[02:01:30]  to confront anybody  and that's all  you're getting  I understand  how offensive  it is to this  woman and her  kids and her  husband and  everything  that's completely  understandable  but as far as  it actually being  a threat  it's not  No I think  it is  but they shouldn't  have their kids  playing the game  I mean they're  exposing their kids  to a lot of bad  things  So you think  the game  shouldn't be  No it's got  nothing to do  with the game  Make no mistake  it's awful  and disgusting  that people go  on Xbox  And play other 
[02:02:00]  races  We should stick  with our own  And call  and they call  and they go there  They're awful people  But this woman  shouldn't have her  kid playing it  and it's got  nothing to do  with Xbox  Again Xbox  is just the street  that they met on  It's just  It's absurd  It's misused  energy to fight  in that direction  like oh we gotta  go after Xbox  It's got nothing  to do with Xbox  There's so many  options on Xbox  You can complain  about somebody  You can actually 
[02:02:30]  send something  directly to Microsoft  about a particular  person  You can block  so you can't  hear them anymore  You can mute  anybody you want  and you can run  your own room  and kick anybody  you want out  of the room  So you know  and there's certain  times kids  shouldn't play  When we're on  No kids should play  They shouldn't be around  They shouldn't be on  You have children  and you're letting  them play  If you have children  and you're letting  your kids play Xbox  you should have  your children  taken away  Xbox online  Then racism  on Wii bowling  anything like that 
[02:03:00]  on the Wiimote  When you use  the Wiimote  to play Wii bowling  with those  wobble headed  bobble doll characters  or Wii baseball  Can you make  your own bowling ball  to look like  somebody's face  Oh god  Alright listen  Dr. Phil makes  the brilliant observation  that technology  is good  and it's bad  Oh wow Dr. Phil  Technology there's  good and bad  I mean you enjoy  playing this game  right  You couldn't do that  before the technology  existed  but it comes  with a downside  I'm spending  thousands of dollars 
[02:03:30]  to Microsoft  so I think  and it's coming  inside of my house  Yeah  and so you think  they owe you  some protection  What?  Alright you're crazy  thousands of dollars  You're crazy  I don't play online  I love artificial intelligence  I love playing the game  the game  I don't like getting online  Online is great  MySpace people  What's your game  I don't want to  play with you  No  It's great  playing real people  Yeah  It's a lot  Because you know  you're frustrated  When you shoot  someone in the face  you know  they're sitting  in their house 
[02:04:00]  just going  You know  they're so frustrated  because that's usually me  You're playing against  somebody else's  like psychology  That's low self-esteem  The computer runs around  the thing  like eight times  I may run around  stop and come back  and shoot you in the face  Call of Duty 4  just playing it on hard  is not hard enough  You're just pissing away  your brain on that stuff  It's just the worst thing  for a human being  I love it  I think  Look for you  How old are you now?  I'm in my 40  You're just coasting  to your death  It's fine 
[02:04:30]  There's nothing being wasted  You've got your career  you make money  You go ahead  You learn everything  you want to learn  Yeah  But for Bob Kelly  Look  two bad months  and you're homeless  so you're putting  your life in danger  Jesus Christ  Wow  He just went right away  He actually gave you  an extra month  Somebody with Spanish  doubloons in their pocket  just told you you're broke  All right listen  We've got two more clips  we want to squeeze in here  Gamer afraid  that the people 
[02:05:00]  threatening him  will find out  who he is  by Googling him  but he's not worried  that he's on national TV  talking about this  Let's listen to this clip  And your fear  is they've said  I'm going to Google you  I'm going to find  You've got a tag  that you use  when you're playing  that somehow  they can trace  that back through  get to your account  find out where you live  and get to you  and that's a possible  No  That's a possible thing  Yes it is Dr. Phil  My fear is  my kids  targeting my kids  and who knows 
[02:05:30]  I don't know  I mean  if people write  I think my rights  to violate  especially if you're  writing KKK  and you're actually  taking the time  to do all this stuff  and spell out stuff  It doesn't take  much time  It's one key  I should be able  to  Don't forget  Caps Lock  I should be able  to swim  in the Pacific Ocean  without sharks  attacking me  I don't need  someone to protect  me against these  sharks when I  get in that water  How about not  getting in the  water my friend 
[02:06:00]  It's my God  given right  to get on the  internet  and play  Shut up  Game is rated M  also  so the kids  shouldn't be  playing it  It's rated M  Let me say this  to black people  please  Intellectual black  people  stop messing around  with dumb white  people  That's what I'm  really getting  tired of  It's always  a retarded  white guy  and then black  people getting  ready to go  well and then  he gets on  and it's a  travesty 
[02:06:30]  It's like it's  these Yahoo  white boys  calling you a  monkey  and you're  bothered by that  Yeah  Let's go to  Kevin in  Connecticut  Kevin  Sounds like  you guys need  the Malcolm  Xbox  Let's go to  Travis from  the Bronx  Travis  Yeah I play  plenty of  Call of Duty  all the time  I'm black  and all this  racism is just  nothing  This guy who's  complaining about  he's a damn  wimp  he's a grown  man 
[02:07:00]  Come on now  I mean  if people are  going to talk  trash to you  it's all in  good fun  they don't really  mean to hurt  your feelings  You know  what they're  doing all here  making a monkey  face  all of them  Oh shut up  They're all  putting their  tongue up  into their  top lip  and they're  going  Jimmy's up  on the  counter  Jimmy's swinging  from a chandelier  and throwing  bananas at people  We were actually  trying to make  the face  Alright  I thought it  didn't say it  glad I didn't  I use the  American History 
[02:07:30]  Xbox  That's the one  I like to use  Let's go to  Mike  or is this  Max  Mike  Yes Mike  What's up Mike  I'm a truck driver  and they do the  same thing on the  CB  they do all the  talking noise  we call them  CB Rambos  you know  you can't see  who they are  but all they do  is talk  Yeah they did  I did that  coming back  from Monterey  my friend  had a CB  he goes  watch this  and he goes  is there anywhere  a black guy  can get breakfast  around here  and just  just  I mean  non-stop 
[02:08:00]  for an hour  and a half  some of the  best jokes  I've ever heard  I mean  really good jokes  like knock  knock jokes  I love the fact  that he knew  he goes  watch this  done it a few times  the thing is  if you go out  to like real  America  where real  people are  all humor  is racist  every single  that's all  people talk about  it's that bad  right  like I  we have a house  upstate  in Columbia County  which is a very  rural part of New York  and my neighbor 
[02:08:30]  who's a farmer  invited me to watch  the Tyson  Lennox Lewis fight  in his barn  he's got  he stole  satellite  and so  all of my neighbors  were all these  really nice people  we all went  and watched it  and a couple  of minutes  into the fight  some guy's like  look at them  monkeys up there  and they just start  and I'm sitting there  like I just feel  horrible  and in front of you  and you're like  the new guy there  yeah I'm like  the New Yorker  and they're  you know  but they're all  I realize  that that's all  they sharpen  their humor  on racism  is the only thing 
[02:09:00]  they have to make fun of  like that's all  they do  alright we got  the final clip here  from Dr. Phil  and it's a site  on there  a game called  Uno  everybody knows  what Uno is  it's actually  a live feed  it's four people  actually  four people  have a camera  and we can see  each other  as we play  the game  Uno  now you have  people on there  taking off  their clothes  and perverted  things  running around  naked  it's all about  the money  now  it's so easy

[02:10:00]  they're getting  naked  they're getting  naked  he should have  turned his  computer off  immediately  I'm getting  Uno  here's the  second half  of the clip  you can go to  your local  7-Eleven  your liquor store  and buy  a year  description  for $49  you can buy  one for $7  come home  actually type  in the code  and you're  online  so who's  to say  my son  my daughter  gets online  plays Uno  innocent  pervert online  luring her  to go do  something  so who's  that fault  didn't he say  son  or is it  Microsoft  if something  happens to  my kid

[02:11:00]  writer's strike  there's like this  online sort of  forum of people  talking about it  and they're all  like writers  and like you know  millionaires  arguing about it  and like I went on  once and just  and questioned  something the  writers guild  was doing  and they're just  like you piece of  like I mean I  never gotten sworn  at so much  in my life  and just say  you should have  your this and  that torn open  and just  and these are  like guys with  jobs in mansions  all of a sudden  they come out  with anonymous  names  you know it  just says  writer 02  and they're just  like you're  a piece of  there's zero  accountability 
[02:11:30]  that's all it  is  online and  everyone knows  that so you  can say whatever  you want  and there's  no responsibility  I was in a  chat room one  time and someone  said something  I didn't like  and I'm like  oh jump in a  lake  hey  oh hey  easy  hey Jimmy  bring us home  get everyone's  plugs out here  will you  alright  well this week  I'm in Pennsylvania  next week I'm at  the Borgata  it's sold out  it's been a great  week  thanks a lot  no everybody else  oh sorry  Patrice is going  to be tonight  and tomorrow  at Governor's  in Levittal  Long Island  four shows

[02:13:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, my God. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:00]  That the air goes blank.  It's like, wow, holy shit.  I said shit during one of your live reads.  Did you?  Oh, yeah.  It's like you lost money on that.  Oh, I sang a go-off dress.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, my mic was on, but in the background, but in the background, but in the background, I was discussing something with Jimmy, and I'm like, yeah, and that's that fucking shit, and blah, blah, blah, and you're in the middle of doing a live read for tigers or something. 
[02:19:30]  It was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, the gym, yeah.  Funny thing about the Dump Report, Louie's like, I'm trying to be better for you guys.  But take note that probably all of these dumps are Louie's.  I know.  Just about.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, Anthony was a good boy.  He didn't make the list.  All right.  Neither did I.  I know.  Oh, Jimmy didn't either.  Yeah, no.  No, you're professional.  Of course we are.  Yeah.  All right.  First one, 7.15 a.m., Patrice O'Neal, so I can piss.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's so dumb.  Can't say piss?  No.  No.  807.  But piss is delicious.  Louie C.K. debuts.  Yeah.  What if you really... 
[02:20:30]  No, excuse me.  Break that.  When does he D-D-debut?  807, Louie C.K.  What if you have really sticky poo?  Really?  Yep.  Sticky poo?  You can say poo.  You just can't describe the poo.  Because when you're trying to target men 18 to 49, you don't want to describe doodos.  They're going to call in and say they didn't like the truck.  I'm a truck driver.  I didn't appreciate that sticky poo.  I ain't listening no more.  That's pretty much the first word kids learn is poo.  Yeah.  But we're not allowed to say it on the radio show. 
[02:21:00]  There's no...  Every kid says it.  Parents refer to their fucking shit as poo.  It's not...  I would defy the FCC to fucking actually fine someone for saying sticky poo.  Yep.  All right.  But what else?  Scary cats.  In 808, Louie backed it up with, things come violently rocking out of our asses.  Rocketing, you motherfucker.  Are they rocking out of your ass?  Like on a chair?  Rocketing.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  That's what I said, didn't I?  Rocketing, he said.  That's what I meant to be.  Yeah.  That's funny.  Rocking isn't funny.  No.  No.  It means there's an old lady on a log just fucking back and forth sipping a fucking lemonade.  Trying to smush it down.  A-10, Howie Mandel said, fuck you.  Ooh, Howie.  That's gray area.  That's the deal or no deal.  Howie Mandel said fuck.  A-12, Louie C.K.  Oh, Jesus.  And this is a comment here, editorialized, in reference to a sheet that was used for sex, 
[02:22:00]  Louie C.K. said, one bloody eyed ghost.  Yeah.  And he never said sex.  No.  But I listen to Tom's logic.  I know why they dumped it, even though I didn't agree with it, but it was like, I can't kill  him for that one, because he's like, none of the sex.  He went through the whole discussion, and at least they think he wasn't completely like  fucking Sticky Poo.  Childish.  Right.  Tom's a smooth talker, though.  That's going to be my rap name, too.  One bloody eyed ghost. 
[02:22:30]  But he's actually from the album Sticky Poo.  Collaborating with Sticky Poo.  But there are times where Tom will go, no, that shouldn't have been dumped.  You know, that was when he's like, no, no, I told him to dump that.  No, on that show, and with who was in that room, and what was being discussed, the dumps,  you know, I would chalk that up to, like, one of those National Guardsmen at Kent State  that shot those kids.  You don't really blame me.  They were charging, I think.  He put a flower in my gun rifle, and then he threw a, you know, lit a firecracker.  What am I going to do? 
[02:23:00]  I shot him.  Sorry.  Right.  Tough situation.  Kenny just goes, right.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Because Kenny wants to talk some more.  What shitty station is doing this?  Hannah Montana contest.  Men dress in drag for Hannah Montana tickets.  And it's some kind of a goofy, wacky radio promotion.  And you interrupted.  Bob had a doozy.  Bob, go.  You asshole.  I didn't see you put a little pressure on what he said.  I had nothing. 
[02:23:30]  I just thought of you down there trying to pick somebody up, and somebody's stealing your  glasses.  That's a great story, man.  That's fantastic.  Give me those motherfuckers.  No, I'm just talking for wasting my time.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Ken.  Louie again.  812.  One pussy bloodied on ghost.  Yeah, well.  Very descriptive.  818.  Louis C.K.  Douchebags.  That's one that never should be done.  Never.  Never.  That's not your fault.  836.  Louis C.K.  Mr. Common Denominator.  Referencing Bob Kelly's Call of Duty 4 team gay, Louis C.K. said, faggot. 
[02:24:00]  Never should have been dumped.  Never should have been dumped.  Never should have been dumped.  You should never call us faggots either.  We're gays.  Every time I clear my throat to talk, they put their finger on the button.  Never should have been dumped.  That's just fucking pussy thinking.  Yeah.  Faggot thinking.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  840.  Patrice.  Spick.  Oh, boy.  Another one that should not have been dumped.  No.  Tom didn't know you were Mexican.  Right.  They think it shouldn't matter, but that's the way they think over them.  Like, dude, it was a racial discussion. 
[02:24:30]  They're parodying racism.  Stop it.  So if there's a spick in the room, you can say spick?  That's the mentality.  What do you expect?  It's all white guys running things.  Yeah, they're doing doors.  I am a spick, and I approve of this message.  They need that.  You have to say it like, I approve of this message.  I approve of this message, senor.  Does anyone really talk like that?  Not a single Mexican in the world.  I love that.  Yes, senor.  Si, senor.  Si.  I got boogies in my nose. 
[02:25:00]  Do you want a drum roll for the last one, since we're supposed to do sound effects?  We're not supposed to do sound effects over here.  I know.  What was it?  I know.  Last one.  846.  Louis C.K.  Pissing away your brain.  What?  But that isn't even like...  That's not even about the frothy yellow drink that is Jimmy's staple.  That's like pissing away your time, or pissing away...  Pissing away is a verb.  Give me a break.  It was fucking once...  I mean, look.  Context, assholes. 
[02:25:30]  Context.  The dumb guys, I know it's a tough gig, but he has got to learn...  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  Pissing away your brain.  Everyone knows.  And I'm talking about people shouldn't have their kids use Xboxes.  That's exactly like you say...  Because they're pissing away their brain, and they dump that.  Come on, dude.  It's the same context as saying, don't give me that crap.  You know, I don't have to take any crap from her.  Or, she crapped on my face.  You can't say she crapped on my face, but you could say, I don't take any more crap. 
[02:26:00]  But pissing away isn't even actually referring to the bathroom.  At all.  It's actually using the verb, like, as if you could piss, you know, money.  I mean, it doesn't make sense.  You could say, pissed off.  I was so pissed off yesterday.  You could say that.  I've never heard of that being dumped anywhere.  Pissing away your...  No, it shouldn't be dumped anywhere.  It's fucking revolting.  Maybe he thought the brain could actually work its way into the bladder. 
[02:26:30]  Right, and then come out of his piss.  And you were pissing.  You know, you're talking about the brain pissing.  I just saw a shoe coming out of the tip of my cock.  I just saw you.  Mixing with the shit and semen that I just put on.  Big red bush.  A hole in a sheaf.  Your freckled cock.  Exactly.  That just disturbed him.  That's right.  Look, I get it.  Well, you tried, though, today, Louie.  That's the important thing.  I know, man.  It's bad.  It's bad.  I'm hurting you guys.  No, there's a few that you shouldn't have done on.  No, but it's a critical mass issue. 
[02:27:00]  It's like when a guy gets mad.  At the ump for, you know, for punching him out.  You swung at strikes one and two.  So you can't.  You put your set.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, I can't.  You know, I said cunt and nigger about five times.  So sure, when I said piss, the guy started dumping me.  And you can't go like, ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm just watching Gavin, making sure he doesn't get pissed at you.  You spit out nigger with the extra nigger. 
[02:27:30]  Then you did it twice.  Well, I said it in a kooky way.  I don't think you said it in a kooky way.  Is that black?  Is that black?  Yeah, that duck.  That's a nigger.  Half black, half white.  Half black, half white.  Yeah, so are we all.  That makes you black.  So are we all.  The eyes of the repressors.  The sense is pure.  The eyes of the repressors.  The sense is pure.  But I was there.  There we go.  There's luck.  Sure.  All right.  Look at Jimmy.  There's a count of luck.  I'm saying they do the account.  Government allows you that. 
[02:28:00]  What's that?  It's all the difference over here.  We got another song from Val Kilmer, everyone.  Oh.  This guy's good, man.  Do we have the one from yesterday to play for the guys?  Oh, we've got to hear the beginning of that.  Just from Val Kilmer?  You're a good singer.  Val Kilmer is going into music.  He's singing.  He does a Neil Young cover.  Hey, can I have another water bottle, please?  There's a fucking layer of film on my water bottle.  Ugh.  I just want a non-filmy water.  What do you mean?  Well, you've got to be specific when you ask for water.  What do you mean film?  Touch it.  Can I get a water?  I've been drinking either.  Touch it. 
[02:28:30]  Just touch it.  Well, it's from you peeling the sticker off.  No, it's not.  The sticker doesn't go to the bottom of the bottle, you fucking hump.  I know where a sticker goes.  I peeled the sticker off so I can hold this.  It's all cloudy feeling.  Bob's trying to back you up, but he can't peel it.  Tell these people that fucking work with us that fucking Norton gets a non-cloudy bottle.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  All right, you guys.  He's an angry man today.  Tranny fucking diva.  I'm all retired.  And he's running somewhere to get a napkin and a new bottle of water. 
[02:29:00]  Do it.  I need water without film.  I stayed up last night.  He doesn't like the film this time.  Jerking a limp cock.  Oh, it was awful.  The head's just bouncing around stupidly.  What do you want from me?  Your cock is like, give me a second.  Jesus.  Let me check it for you before you touch it.  I can feel it.  Here, you can drink that one.  I don't want that.  Stop angrily putting the water down.  There's a fine line between the time you can jack off and when your arm gets tired. 
[02:29:30]  There's a fine line there.  Now, when you jack your cock until there's so many raw spots on it, you've got to kind  of grab it awkwardly.  Then you have to actually put your finger in the hole and hook it.  Because there's so many stingy, stingy red spots on it.  Way too much.  Fucking starts bleeding.  And then you use that for a loop.  Actually, I jerk off with my left hand.  And ever since I got married, I just feel uncomfortable because my wedding ring. 
[02:30:00]  Are you left-handed?  I have to take my wedding ring off now.  Really?  And it just makes me feel bad.  Are you a lefty?  Yeah, I'm a lefty.  I ride with my right hand, but I jerk off with my left.  Yeah, what a fucking creep.  Why?  Is that it?  I'm a creep?  Yes.  Why?  Why is that creepy?  You jerk off with your left hand.  Who does that?  I'm of the same school, Bob.  You jerk off with your left hand?  You can't do it.  You don't have the coordination.  It goes all whacking.  You're all over the place.  Her own thing.  Her own thing does the same thing.  It's a sign of intelligence.  I'm right righty. 
[02:30:30]  I'm very awkward.  It's too awkward.  But left hand reversal.  Now you're talking nice, right?  No, it's like how left-handed people write, they write from above the words, you know?  Oh, it looks ridiculous when left-handed people write.  Yeah.  They're annoying.  It's just wrong.  They're like, hand is wrapped around like a cobra.  Right backwards.  Yes.  It's a fucking creep.  That must be what it's like when they jerk off.  Like, you gotta come around as if trying to pretend it's a right hand.  They come first.  They have to, like, put the semen back in the dick. 
[02:31:00]  Fucking smudging over everything.  Fucking hate lefties.  It's time for some Val Kilmer.  So Val Kilmer, he wants to be a musician.  He's good, man.  He's got, like, five or six songs on his MySpace.  And he's trying to get a record deal.  And what I'm about to play is a piece of After the Goal Rush, the famous Neil Young song.  That he re-recorded?  Yeah.  But then we got a brand new one for everybody.  We got a brand new Val Kilmer song. 
[02:31:30]  But listen to me.  Excellent.  To a piece of this.  What?  That's the remix.  The original is in the Masculpeter.  I'm sorry.  Eric just told me to tell you that.  Is that what you just said?  Oh, boy.  So this is a remix.  Meaning you guys remixed it?  Oh, yeah.  No.  What?  Is it the super mix?  Yes.  I don't want the super mix.  Why would I want that?  We want the...  You need a straight line first.  E-Rock.  What did E-Rock do?  Oh, E-Rock.  Hold on.  Let's give him the benefit of that.  E-Rock, what'd you do?  Here.  He's running in.  Let's ask him.  He might have... 
[02:32:00]  We can't just throw E-Rock under the bus.  No, the originals were set up like Oak wanted, and I gave Than the remix and said, in case  he wants that one, too.  Where's the original?  The original is right there.  Yeah, we just want the original today.  All right.  Whatever.  All right.  Now, go do all the exercises you'll do for the next month by running out there and grabbing  it.  Congrats.  You almost did something right today.  Sorry.  That was a cheap shot.  Oh, very close to right.  I try to go to bed for Eric.  I hate him.  I'm going to go to bed at this point.  All right.  Hey, so here's Val Kilmer doing Neil Young's After the Goal Rush. 
[02:32:30]  That's good.  Well, I dream this little night in armor coming.  Yes.  The Indian from Natural Born Killers.  Is he kidding?  No.  No, that's just that.  Sincere?  Yeah.  It gets better though.  The Indian from Natural Born Killers split the tree.  There was a fair fair going to the sun. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, wow.  This is horrible.  This is real.  Oh, my God.  It was floating on the breeze.  That's right.  Yes.  Look at Mother Nature on the run.  In the 21st century.  Oh, God.  Kill yourself.  Have to update it.  Right.  Right.  Look at Mother Nature on the run.  In the 21st century.  What an asshole. 
[02:33:30]  I've actually heard fucking women queef songs.  Jeez.  I'm a bit better than this.  Fucking makes fucking Dane Cook sound like an actress singer.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, don't you talk about my boss like that.  I'm sure I will.  His driver's going to take issue.  I'm sure I will.  He's driving.  I'm not driving anymore.  The guy who checks him into his hotel is going to get mad.  Torgasm 2 might be happening.  So we're going to keep love on this one.  No, you asshole.  I'm kidding.  Why would you say no?  That was a massive success.  Yeah, it was. 
[02:34:00]  No, it wasn't.  For him.  It was horrible.  Nobody watched it.  It was terrible.  I know.  It was after my show.  I saw the ratings every week.  Oh, shit.  People watched every week.  Anyway.  It was a...  Anyway, but Val Kilmer...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  No, we're talking about Val Kilmer.  Wait a minute, Lou.  Hold on.  I'd love to defend it, but I really can't.  I was on a show with Jay Davis.  You were great on that show.  There's no doubt.  But the show was not successful.  It was a disaster.  But then he luckily didn't have a lot of viewers.  I didn't get him fucking...  No, we had a lot of viewers. 
[02:34:30]  That's exactly right.  That life sucks.  I didn't make it die.  I got two points on the DVD, and I was actually hoping that he might sell a lot of DVDs.  And it didn't.  My lawyer called.  And you know my lawyer's chunk from the Goonies.  Yeah, he's a lawyer now.  And that's the same as a lawyer.  But he's just ridiculous.  He's like an aggressive lawyer.  He's just an ass.  And I was like, this guy's going to get me some money.  He called back, nothing.  You made nothing.  They sold me nothing.  No.  Nothing.  No, we used to get the ratings every week, and they'd show us the whole HBO lineup. 
[02:35:00]  It would be Entourage, and then us, and then Torgasm.  And we were ticking up every week a little bit.  But Torgasm was dumping really hard.  There was one point where Torgasm would go down, and then a shitty movie with whoever in it.  Jan Michael Vinson?  Yeah, like a Jan Michael Vinson movie that came on after, and like 12 midnight, would go up from what Torgasm was doing.  Oh, wow.  Zero people watched.  That's not good.  No, it was a very poorly done show.  Why don't we fucking...  But Bob, I used to watch it because I didn't really know you that well. 
[02:35:30]  What does Dennis Hopper want?  And I got to like you from watching you on that show.  You came out well.  Yeah.  You acquitted yourself nicely on that show.  Hold on.  What is fucking...  What's going on out there?  What is Barry Slotnick?  What's fucking doing?  What is going on?  I don't know what he is.  Pointing and...  It's like a zoo.  Looking at stuff.  What are those people doing?  Who is that creep?  Ridiculous.  They're looking out.  Hey, hold on.  I want to know if fucking...  They're building something out there.  Hey, what does the father from Family Ties want in this studio? 
[02:36:00]  Why is my Republican son shaking all over the place?  What is this creep?  What does he want?  Oh, enough.  He's got a little earpiece in there, too.  We got today's Val Kilmer sauce.  Fucking personal.  Val Kilmer, Jesus.  That's great, right?  I have a weird story about Val Kilmer, and I'm not sure I should tell it, but I'm going  to anyway.  Tell it.  We love you.  Because this is kind of private, but Chris Rock told me that he got a call once from Val  Kilmer got his number through channels, of famous people channels. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  He doesn't know.  They both are.  And he called him and left a message.  He was like, hey, man, let's hang out sometime.  I want to know if you want to hang out and go to a game or something like that.  And Chris was like, I don't fucking...  Do you think just because we were both in movies once, you can just call me and I'll  hang out with you?  Like, I guess celebrities do that, but for some reason that instance of it really rubbed  him wrong, that Val Kilmer thinks like he's the president, like he can just get folks  on the phone and hang out with him. 
[02:37:00]  Like he was watching Chris on TV and thought, yeah, I'm going to go to the game with that  guy tomorrow.  I'm Val Kilmer.  We both work in the same industry.  Yeah, very vaguely.  It's like a steel worker just calling another steel worker and going, hey, you want to hang  out?  Let's go to the park.  Yeah, but you got to love like Chris, like Chris's, like his immediate honesty.  My response time is like three days later.  I'd be in the movie theater or hanging out with this jackass and uncomfortable.  Why am I here?  Yeah, and then I'd be home having the argument by myself.  Dude, Val.  First of all, don't... 
[02:37:30]  You should have said, Val, don't call me.  Don't even try to say you wouldn't fucking latch on a Val Kilmer's dick.  That's exactly what I said, that I would.  In a minute.  That's exactly my choice.  If you said your response time is three days later, you would be saying, why am I hanging  out with Val?  You'd be like, Val, Val, Val.  The new Val Kilmer on your phone.  Val would be playing Call of Duty 4.  Chris is a very real guy.  I was with Chris once in Aspen for the comedy festival, and some people grabbed us, some 
[02:38:00]  promotion people, me and Chris.  We're just out on the street in Aspen, and they kind of corralled us into this designer  store, this really, really expensive, like $600 shirt store.  And they said, take whatever you want.  Like, because they wanted Chris to wear their stuff.  Right, yeah, yeah.  And I'm standing with them, so they said it to both of us, take whatever you want.  And Chris is a very classy guy, so he was like, you know what, give me a t-shirt.  I don't like, he just doesn't want to take.  He doesn't want to be a pig.  He goes, just give me a t-shirt.  I don't want to take this nice stuff.  What did Joey Louie do?  I said, I made them fucking un-padlock a leather jacket, and I'm like, give me that jacket. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, wow.  And the woman, this British woman, she's like, okay.  And she went and kissed him.  Oh, you know she didn't want to.  No, she did not want to at all.  Good for her.  And I'm like, because he's in a place like that every day, and he has discretion, but  I'm like, I may never have to have this opportunity again.  I'm like, give me a leather jacket.  They have to take the alarm off the leather.  That's hilarious.  They have to disarm the alarm.  How much of a leather jacket worth? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, that thing had to be ridiculous.  It's the greatest jacket in the world.  How much of a leather jacket worth?  God, he's 500 bucks.  What?  Okay.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  Perhaps, probably like at least 2,500 bucks, I think.  Wow, yeah.  When we were doing the Vegas Comedy Festival with Dane, they promised,  because we were with Dane, and we were supposed to go to this party, we were going to get  free Sony Vios.  Me, Gary, and Dane.  We got those from that.  Yeah.  But Dane was like, we weren't going to make the flight or the party, and he was like, 
[02:39:30]  ah, you know what we're going to do.  It was a vodka party.  But the only thing in my head was like, I got to get to Vegas.  I need my free computer.  Yeah.  I got the free computer.  I got it, too.  And it's sitting in my closet.  But I had a really push.  I'm a piece of shit, because my dad, too.  My dad's pretty poor.  Like, he doesn't make a lot of money.  And I said to him, because I got that Vio, and I called it.  I am a Mac guy.  I have no use for it.  And I said, I have a new Vio.  Do you want it?  And he's like, that would really be a big help to me.  And I just haven't sent it.  Yeah, I haven't sent it.  Piece of shit.  It's sitting there. 
[02:40:00]  No one's using it.  It's such a great computer.  My own father.  It isn't even like I could donate it to a school, actually, and help kids.  My own father, who works for very little money.  It's just sitting there.  I'm like, yeah.  Oh, yeah, dad, shit.  Yeah, I'll send it.  Sorry.  How could you not help the man that blasted a load into your mother while she was sleeping?  In Mexico.  Because he's Mexican.  Because he's a filthy Mexican.  He doesn't deserve anything.  All right.  It blows me away.  Go back to Mexico and get a computer. 
[02:40:30]  Go back to Mexico and invent a computer out of beans, you fucking smelly spick.  Beans?  Why do you need it?  You're not going to be able to plug it in.  I know.  You live in a hut.  Yeah, exactly.  What are you going to power it with your fucking Mexican sex shit and make a battery out of it?  Yeah.  A dirt key.  You're only going to use it to fucking, you know, cross the border with you somehow.  Sure.  You've got to close the case over yourself and hide it.  You're going to use it as a hat to block the sun in the fields. 
[02:41:00]  Open it like a heavy V.  Put it on your stupid, non-thinking head.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Christ.  Are we ready for the Val Kilmer?  Oh, I'm going for Val Kilmer.  This guy's terrific.  Today's song is called Hold On To Daddy.  Oh, I'm with Daddy.  I like that.  I think that's nice.  Shut up with your daddy.  Yeah.  When I'm gone, I'll see you hold on to Daddy. 
[02:41:30]  Where did he sing this?  I know.  Larry Craig sitting there tapping his foot next to him in the shower.  Wow.  He's got a studio on the back of a flatbed.  Fucking asshole.  Jesus Christ.  It's horrid.  He's just not there, is he?  Hey, the recording studio's not good.  Where would you like to work?  Do you have a room with aluminum and tin on the left?  That would be perfect.  Because you're going to cry, you're going to cry. 
[02:42:00]  He's dead.  What's he doing?  I don't know.  When I'm gone.  When I'm gone.  I wish you were gone.  Yeah.  When I'm gone.  When I'm gone.  You're going to cry.  I think she's so.  Cry when you sing.  He's very bluesy.  This guy's got some soul, man.  He doesn't like it.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  That was soul of a Doc Martin put against his head.  Yeah.  You're going to feel cold, cold down to your bone.  You're going to cry.  You're going to cry.  Your daddy, your daddy's gone.  That's right.  Your daddy's gone.  I get it.  Did you cough?  He's coughing.  This couldn't be real.  Was there coughing in this? 
[02:43:00]  Oh.  This has to be a booth.  He's coughing.  Sounds like someone's trying to take the guitar away from him.  There's a fight going on. 
[02:43:30]  Turn your back and watch the sun go down.  How?  I'm done.  First, please.  You're not saying anything.  Is he asleep on the mic?  Right, we get it.  All right.  Talk about daddy again, will you?  I'm crying happy, happy, daddy's going home. 
[02:44:00]  He came another song down.  Yeah, just keep pranking him out there, you fucking asshole.  What happened to the Iceman?  I used to like him, and now I fucking hope his kids get a blood disease.  They need a transfusion, and it gives them AIDS on top.  Fucking asshole.  You do not like him at all.  Bad music.  Nothing more insulting than bad music.  It makes you mad.  My kid's got sickle cell. 
[02:44:30]  It really does make you angry.  Yeah, it does.  I think he's getting it.  Especially a famous guy going, this is good.  I'm putting this out there.  Yeah, he's not kidding.  Is he really serious, too?  He's crazy.  I've seen him on interviews and stuff on late night talk shows and stuff, and he's like crazy.  He's a hard interview.  The thing that people don't get is that actors are jocks.  They play interesting people, and you attribute that interestingness to them. 
[02:45:00]  They're jocks.  They're people that have this weird rubber ability with their face and their voice, and  they're just sieves.  And you can get them to do shit, but then you listen to them talk.  This guy's a fucking idiot.  There's nothing there.  They're just dippy, stupid, flaky assholes.  But they can act like real cool people.  Because there's nothing else to prevent them from being someone else.  That's right.  But can't you just act like that all the time?  Just act.  Yeah, you think, well, because they actually, well, like, watch Actor's Studio. 
[02:45:30]  When they're talking, like, and they let their hair down amongst each other, and you just  want to drop a bomb in the entire building.  And nothing bad would come of it.  Shitheads.  I feel bad for his wife having to lie to him every day.  It's great, honey.  It's great.  It's kids.  Well, she probably thinks it is great.  If he's that much of an asshole that he's saying that, his wife's a stupid cunt.  Just by deduction, I can just tell you by the transitive law that his wife is a retarded  cunt with shit ears. 
[02:46:00]  Fucking married that faggot, you stupid cunt.  Bad music makes you mad.  It does make you mad.  He's not.  He's completely angry.  That's what I think when I hear a bad song is whoever's singing this, his wife is a cunt.  And his kids deserve to die.  We're going to take our first break on XM.  Don't forget, Bob Kelly's at Caroline's All Weekend.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100. 
[02:46:30]  But Bob's got an odd schedule.  Tonight at 10.30, Saturday, 10.30, Sunday, 8 p.m.  That's it, Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  And Louie's going to be in Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit in the near future.  Starting February 14th.  14th, 15th, and 16th.  Website for these days.  LewisCK.com.  I'm all over the...  I'm on tour heavily.  He's on MySpace, too, every day.  MySpace.  On the front cover.  Slash LewisCK.  And what about Gavin?  Where are you going to be?  Just walking around Manhattan.  Are you going to be blasting chicks or what?  Blasting white girls.  I'm in Miami on Wednesday.  I keep forgetting to say that. 
[02:47:00]  Hey, you know what?  Knoxville, Louisville.  Okay, that brings up something, because we had to keep it clean on the other side.  So you've got to retell that story now that we're on this side, what you were hearing  and shit.  Oh, the other room?  Yeah.  So it's your wife's best friend from Boston.  Well, she was on the rag, too, which is disgusting.  I'm glad you missed that bit out, actually.  Oh, he just fucking blasted her with a bloody white girl pussy.  That was a long time ago, man.  Wait, your wife's best friend comes down from Boston?  Wife's best friend comes down from Boston.  She's, you know...  A little innocent? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, she looks like Rhoda.  She looks like Rhoda.  She looks like Rhoda.  Rhoda.  You know, and she comes down, and apparently she likes the black dudes.  Yeah?  Yeah, she's got a hunkering for a big black cock.  It's a hankering, you dummy.  A hunkering.  I like hunkering, though.  I can relate to that.  Thanks, Hope.  I was actually...  It's mispronunciation Friday?  It actually is, yeah.  Go fuck yourself, Air Supply.  Air Supply.  You do look like the lead singer. 
[02:48:00]  What?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Now, not back then.  You look like him now.  No, he doesn't.  He's fucking chef from Apocalypse Now.  Yeah.  I'm a saucy-y.  Saucy-y.  So...  I want to see you get his head off.  Never get out of the fucking boat.  Fucking Kurtz joke.  Yeah, I like it.  So...  So he's...  It was good you combined two people. 
[02:48:30]  It was fantastic.  That was brilliant.  So Gav used to come over to my place when he first came over from England.  He would come over and hang out.  Like, we'd play video games all day.  Because, you know, I had the Xbox Live.  You'd be off the interesting part of the story.  Of course.  Well, he would come over and I...  Literally, I'd be like, all right, man.  It's time to go.  And he'd be like, all right, mate.  Literally?  I'd be like, I gotta go to sleep.  And he'd be like, all right, go ahead, man.  I'm gonna hang out and I'll play video games.  Oh, yeah.  And I'd be in my room playing video games.  And he came over for like two weeks straight.  He was at my house.  My girl, at the beginning of it, was like, hey, what's up, Gav? 
[02:49:00]  At the end of it, he was like, hey, Gav.  Fuck you.  And then she actually, we cooked dinner and she cooked a whole pork roast.  And we had like, I had one slice, she had one slice, Gav had one slice.  It was so good that Gav goes, are you guys done?  Are you finished?  And we're like, yeah, that's it.  And he just grabbed, stuck his force in the rest of the pork roast and put it on his plate.  Not joking.  Ate a whole, almost a whole pork roast by himself. 
[02:49:30]  Wow.  And so my girlfriend's girl comes over and...  First of all, don't try to make it sound like you had some little sliver off the fucking piece.  Exactly.  I'm sure you had a nice chunk.  Exactly.  He bought that shit he'd been into while I was still living.  I actually fought Gavin third.  I took a beating for a pork roast.  I sucked his cock for a pork roast.  In the sauna.  Easy.  In the sauna.  We worked out together. 
[02:50:00]  You stuck his cock for a pork rind.  We're in the sauna and he takes all his clothes off.  It's like a two-person sauna in my building.  And he's one and a half.  He's a big guy.  How tall are you?  Six, six, five?  Six, five.  Six, five.  Two hundred and fucking nine thousand pounds.  And we're in there.  I have my shorts on and I took my shirt off.  I think I even kept my sneakers and socks on.  I just went in just to get a quick steam.  He comes in. 
[02:50:30]  Who comes in a steam room with sneakers?  Exactly.  A sauna.  It was a sauna.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that's my story.  And he comes in and just takes everything off.  That's right.  That's what you do in the sauna.  No, you don't.  In England, you do.  In America, you don't.  In Europe, you do.  In England, you don't either.  In Europe, you just knock it.  Can you get into the English black guy fucking the girl's bloody cunt?  Oh, my God.  Really?  Exactly.  That's the story.  You forgot to mention how much time he had on his MetroCard.  Fucking get to the cunt fucking.  I like the sauna story, though.  Ruined.  That was that.  Unclean cunt fucking. 
[02:51:00]  Anthony brought up the...  I want to hear how it sounded like he was jumping up and down in cherry tomatoes.  So, they meet up and we all have fun or whatever.  We do some horse shit.  And then later that night, she's staying at the house.  So, Gav's staying there, too, apparently.  And I've never had a friend stave over since I was in, like, fucking high school.  How can you stave over?  That's not a word.  Are you going to be on everything?  Jesus Christ. 
[02:51:30]  What happened to your storytelling abilities?  I'm a little nervous.  Jesus.  Get to the fucking.  Exactly.  Shut your face.  So, what happened?  She's staving over.  Shut up.  Put your hands down, first of all.  I don't like it.  Why?  I just don't like your little thin fingers pointing at my face.  Anything's thin compared to your face.  That was a fucking softball.  So's your head.  I don't like that thin redwood pointing at me.  I'm with Bob, though.  We're getting to know what Gavin's all about.  Oh, I know.  Because, you know, there's something going on with this guy. 
[02:52:00]  He's a fucking uncut, pork-fucking-eating monster.  That's what I hear.  Six.  Bob and his girl are kissing, and they hear, he's caving my pussy in.  And he screams in the living room.  But he keeps going, I think I had Xbox.  Wait, are we playing Grand The...  Get to the fucking Gavin killing it with this big cop.  This is like somebody who's like, Leon Zabruder talking about the day Kennedy was shot.  Or Abraham Zabruder.  I don't know if it's Leon Zabruder.  He had a brother, Leon.  Oh, for everybody.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:52:30]  No, it's like fucking...  And then fucking Abraham Klinghofer.  What the fuck are you, a computer?  Relax.  Let people fuck up and be human.  Leon fucking Zabruder.  Oh, yeah.  He shot Pete Kennedy in the head.  Shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to stick up for you.  Harley Osmond.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Norton's on fire.  Jack Ruby Red Grapefruit.  Fucking idiot.  What the fuck are you pushing me into the fucking light of fire? 
[02:53:00]  It's cold.  Nothing good's going to happen.  This is taking way too long.  It's in the middle.  Oh, I know.  So.  Get some fucking devastation of the pussy.  Let me just take a breath so I make sure I say things correctly.  Hey, Larry's okay.  Don't know that.  It won't fucking grab me.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Fucking.  All right.  Sorry.  Hey, Peggy.  So we come back to the house and they're on the.  We go in the. 
[02:53:30]  We're like, you know, it comes to that point where it's like, OK, Gav is going to either  go home or, you know, we're going to bed.  OK, we'll see you guys later.  And they're on the couch still.  So we go in the bedroom.  We're lying there.  I got the two dogs.  The dogs were scared.  Kelby.  Fucking dog was licking my feet.  It smelled like fucking roast beef.  He was just licking blood.  Off the couch.  So we're in the bed.  And you just, you hear the kid that, that, that the first kissing that. 
[02:54:00]  You fucking.  You fucking.  You fucking.  You fucking.  And then I'll.  Then you just hear fucking.  The couch.  Just.  Like it was wood.  You didn't hear.  It wasn't even metal.  He was actually getting into the wood of the couch.  Like, you know, you have the springs in the couch.  Yeah.  You hear the wood just going.  Like a ship.  Like a ship in heavy seas. 
[02:54:30]  It was the black pearl.  But he.  But she.  Just to let you know, this girl weighs probably 85 pounds.  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  She looked like she had AIDS.  Like that's how thin she was.  She was a thin, thin girl.  And this fucking monster.  Just on the 300.  Oh, just plowing her.  Being her chiropractor.  That's funny.  He did the equivalent of kicking her cunt in with a metal boot. 
[02:55:00]  The equivalent.  But she actually told Dawn.  My girl actually said to me.  The reason why I know she was on the period.  Because I was like, do you think they're going to.  We're in the room like.  Do you think they're going to fuck?  And she's like, no.  She's on the period.  She said she wasn't going to do anything.  But this fucking monster just plucked that tampon out like a fucking.  A pear off a tree.  I just threw it against my wall.  He made tea for count count.  There you go.  Skip this.  Straighten out her scoliosis. 
[02:55:30]  That's nice.  Took the curl out of her fallopian tubes.  He smoothed out all the bumpy parts of her pussy.  What the hell was that?  I'll tell you what it was.  Sorry.  All right.  There you go.  And then he just left her.  Your friend is fucking gone.  Just left her.  Yeah, you left.  Of course I just left.  What do you do?  Kiss and cuddle and fucking.  Then you went to Boston and fucked her one more time, didn't you?  Yeah, I did, yeah. 
[02:56:00]  But she fell in love with him.  She was great.  She likes the cock.  She usually dates gangster American black guys, which are totally different than this fucking  suave English douche.  Oh, yeah, totally.  I was using all kinds of slang.  This is lethal.  He's black, but he's really light-skinned.  Right.  And with the accent.  And he's got an accent.  Right.  And he's made of pure animal.  He's like a tiger.  He's like that tiger that killed a kid in San Diego.  That's right.  Like, you know there's a woman fucking masturbating to that in the food court. 
[02:56:30]  A little smooth accent.  Oh, yeah, Tracy.  I'm black, but it's all right.  Listen to me.  It's all right.  I like white girls, too.  Next thing you know, he's fucking her with his fucking hand over her face like Chief when  he's killing Nielsen.  She was pretty weird, wasn't she?  Well, yeah.  You know, she actually, I'll tell you, she actually hooked up with this guy, a black guy.  The crazy thing is, this woman exists.  She's out somewhere and we're telling a story about her. 
[02:57:00]  This is a few years ago now.  It's going back a few years.  Oh, okay.  It's not recently.  She's got a whole other life now.  Yeah, she's moved on.  Well, she moved on to another black guy who was actually turned out to be a pimp and threw  in a trunk and locked her in there and drove around the city for like four hours.  True?  Yeah, a trunk.  Hey, look, you fucking pick up a scorpion, you're going to get bit.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  All right, we're going to break.  Get into some smoothies.  He said, because I'm an alligator.  Story tells a lot.  Get us out of here for a bit. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, and I thought you were.  I know I speak like an idiot.  Do you?  It's all about me.  Is it?  I was assaulted.  Were you?  We're brilliant broadcasters.  Are we?  You are out of your mind.  Am I?  That sounds real good.  Does it?  I'm thrilled.  I'm excited.  Am I?  I thought I heard Negro.  Did you?  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Is it?  We'll be right back. 
[02:58:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:58:30]  Wing on over to Mohegan's son and gamble with the engines.  It's going to be great.  Yep. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  I ran into a guy last night who you're going with.  What's his name that works here sometimes?  Keith.  Is that his name?  Yeah.  Looks kind of like Otto Peterson a little bit.  Keith the cop.  Wow.  Doesn't he?  He does.  Yeah, a little bit.  Otto, if he had said no back in like 1974 to that first line that was offered to him.  Exactly.  Long way to go for nothing.  Yeah, I wasn't sure.  I was at the olive tree with my daughter, my two-year-old, and he walked up with a uniform  cop.  Yeah.  And I wasn't exactly sure.  Like, I've seen him on the tour mostly. 
[02:59:30]  I don't know him that well.  And he went, hey, what's up?  And when I'm with my daughter, I really want people to stay the fuck away from me.  Like, I'm very protective.  Right.  You just have a different...  So he's like, hey, and he's like going to her, hey.  I'm like, get the fuck...  Like, I think I might have been shitty to him.  I hope I wasn't.  He's an NYPD lieutenant.  Yeah.  I think he's okay.  No, I...  Well, I know, but cops run amongst filth, you know, like...  Well, that's true.  You know, they put it in jail, but still, you don't want them to touch your daughter after  a fucking...  Dirty fucking tranny finger. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  You got a point there.  Pushing some crackhead's head down into a cruiser.  Yeah.  Now that hand is...  Little lice on his hand.  Yeah.  Now he's touching my kid's head.  Give her head a tussle or hair.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, he's going.  Him and his wife, me, my girl, and my mother, and Sal.  Sal's just been calling every day.  He's excited, huh?  Sal, we're going.  It's almost Friday, Anthony. 
[03:00:30]  This is going to be a lot of fun.  So what?  You got a suite?  And the plane?  And the limo?  It's from Baltimore.  So it's just like...  Oh.  Row!  Row!  We're going to go row.  Pack.  What kind of clothes am I going to need?  He's like asking me things.  I go, I don't know.  Just bring gambling clothes.  He's so excited.  He's like a little kid.  Take care of him.  He's a good man.  We're going on a plane.  And, yeah, so... 
[03:01:00]  Private jet back and forth.  We're doing that.  They hooked us up with, yeah, three big suites.  You'll have some stories on Monday.  If you're here on Monday.  I went to the safety deposit box.  Had to go to the box.  Yeah.  I was in there a while.  What do you keep in your box?  In your safety deposit?  To keep...  Cash.  But isn't that stupid?  No.  No.  I mean, isn't that not collecting interest or something?  Yeah, but it's a different account that I have.  It's called a collect either a lot of interest by winning or really losing a lot of it. 
[03:01:30]  It's my gambling money.  Oh, okay.  So you just want fast access.  I just...  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  I like being able to keep tabs on my win-loss record.  Okay.  So it all goes in the box.  And then when I go, I take it out of the box.  And hopefully when I come home, I get to put some back into the box.  It's called two boxes.  And that's how it goes.  Oh, you are two boxes.  I would love to have to ask for a bigger box.  How much is in that box at a given time? 
[03:02:00]  Well, we'd have to shut the mics off again.  But isn't it stupid?  But isn't it dumb to have cash?  Doesn't cash just sit there and not collect...  Hold on.  He'll explain everything.  Yeah, here it is.  We have to have all the mics.  We have to have all the mics. 
[03:02:30]  I love how...  That's how she's sound thinking.  The story always ends up like that, where it's like, we go away.  You turn everybody around.  There's a complete lack of understanding before the mics are off.  And then when the mics come back on, it's like, oh, Jesus Christ, of course.  Oh, yeah.  You'd be a great politician.  You'd be a great politician.  What kind of shitty advice was that from Louie anyway? 
[03:03:00]  He's gambling.  Why don't you buy treasury bonds?  Fucking goody two-shoes.  I'm buying a lot of chips.  I have nothing in the bank anywhere, so...  I'm buying a lot of chips.  I'm hoping to bring back more chips to the window.  And, yeah, that's this weekend.  What are you playing, blackjack or the three-card poker?  Blackjack.  Three-card poker's kind of fun to fuck around with and stuff.  But if you're serious and wanting to get in there and maybe do some damage either way, 
[03:03:30]  blackjack's the game.  When are you coming back?  Sunday.  Do you have your own table or are you just playing with other players?  A host, my own table.  But I have played with other people.  If they're good, it's fine.  You don't want to play with the frail, smoking Asian gentleman that doesn't know when to hit  or stay.  That's a little annoying.  But, you know, you play in the high roller section and they all know what they're doing,  so you don't have to worry about it.  So is it better to play on your own or better to play with other players? 
[03:04:00]  It's better to play with other players, I've found.  When you just, you and the dealer, it goes a little too fast.  Yeah, that's the problem.  It goes a little too fast.  And I don't like the automatic shuffler.  I like when they have to stop, shuffle the shoe.  I like taking a little breather.  It does show you how much of it is in your brain, though, how much of it is.  Like when you play roulette and there's a whole table full of people, you feel pretty  good, but when you're just one asshole, you've just got these two lonely chips.  You're the lone zebra at the watering hole. 
[03:04:30]  And the fucking ball falls like 10 miles away from where you were.  And you realize how dumb, that's when you realize how dumb roulette is.  Yeah.  When there's like every number has a chip on it, you're like, hey, one of us is going to  Because every time someone's like, yeah, I want it.  You're like, that could be me.  When you're alone, it's like, you realize how many numbers you can't cover.  Yeah, that's impossible.  How is the longest you've ever played?  Oh, my God.  20, probably 20 hours.  Sober? 
[03:05:00]  Eight minutes.  As long as it took for the first drink to arrive.  Yeah, yeah.  Usually when I sit down, the first thing I'll do is order a drink.  Sure.  Yes.  But you really do have to be careful, though.  Because you can't get too fucked up.  They'll try to feed you drink.  You've got to be able to think reasonably.  But it helped one time.  It ended up, it was somewhere around 6 in the morning.  Keith the cop was sitting there.  I was getting pretty, like, hammered. 
[03:05:30]  But I was way up.  And I was kind of, oh, nice sound effect.  Wow.  Tom would love this.  Sure.  But I was getting too tired.  I would have stayed there.  And I was up.  But I was like, you know something?  I'm just too fucking tired to continue.  So I walked away with the chips and walked away ahead.  But I would have stayed there until, you know, oh, the pile went down a little.  Should I leave?  No.  Stay until you win that back.  No, your body has more financial sense than your brain does.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Kenny Rogers said it best.  That's right.  Come in my beard.  That's right.  Hey, Gatlin boys, go fuck Becky.  Come in my beard.  I like the sound.  I feel like I'm there.  That's a line from his famous song.  It really is, yes.  The come, God, love the counter.  It's a B-side.  It's a B-side.  Thank you. 
[03:06:30]  Everyone.  All right.  We know he's a coward, right?  He's crying on his fucking daddy's picture.  Sucks.  Sissy.  Where's Danny?  We got to get the Bob Kelly puking audio on.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Yeah.  We've been teasing this for a few days, but Danny's saying this is the best puke you've  had yet.  It's from your Saturday Night Virus show, right?  Saturday Night Puke show.  Well, this girl was explaining.  Oh, I followed this shit, didn't I?  You mean on one of the virus?  Oh, no.  From your Saturday Night Live.  No, no, no.  I thought you meant from the virus tour.  No, no, no.  I just remember him puking on stage and now me. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, good.  Fucking slipped in his puke.  The girl was talking about.  We were talking about yeast infections, and they were actually just in depth going into  what a yeast.  I always thought.  Jimmy explained to me a yeast infection is that milky, yeah, white stuff.  Elmer's glue.  Yeah.  But apparently it can turn lumpy.  Like some of it's cheese.  Really?  And then they actually, they use a suppository to help, and you have to put that in, but 
[03:07:30]  that actually creates another mixture.  Almost like a...  Wow.  You're making a white Russian in there.  How long does a yeast infection have to go for before it hits these different stages?  Six months.  Wow.  It's like baking a fucking cake.  They pull a Pepperidge farm box out of our country.  It's like a Dutch oven.  We got Danny in studio.  Danny.  Well, now, by saying it was the best one ever, I just want to just preface this by saying 
[03:08:00]  it's not the best audio of Bob puking ever, but it was definitely his best puke as far  as volume and consistency.  Oh, wow.  Oh, you actually...  It came out projectile, but because something hit me, because I have a...  Something happened to me a long time ago when I was...  When I used to drink and party and shit when I was younger, me and my friends would all  get trashed and fucked this woman, this retarded woman named Connie.  Oh, God.  God, Connie.  Let me just jump in and go, you don't say woman like retarded woman. 
[03:08:30]  Like that's a casual assignment.  I don't know if she was retarded more than...  She might have been mentally ill more than retarded.  It wasn't like she was going, oh, I like talk.  It was more...  She would repeat herself like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But she was around 35.  Get the papers, get the papers.  Get the papers, get the papers.  Wapner.  Wapner's on at five.  So...  So we're... 
[03:09:00]  We're on a bus.  We're on an abandoned school bus.  She was retarded enough not to wash her pussy.  Apparently so.  I don't know where I think this story's going.  We were on a...  We all got stoned.  We met her on this abandoned school bus in an alley or something.  How old is she, Bubby?  This sounds like a rape, by the way.  Yeah, of course.  That was another day.  Christ.  But there was around four of us, or five of us.  And...  You just happened upon some woman who hangs out in a...  Retarded empty bus. 
[03:09:30]  I got nervous.  It was the fucking cops.  Yeah, well...  So, I was the last one in.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You fucking cream pie, didn't you, sissy boy?  You're a buddy cuckold.  He laid on the back of the bus, and she fucking squatted loads into his mouth.  Oh, Jesus, please.  Jesus, please.  No, a Boston cream pie.  Jesus.  No, no.  It's not your fantasy boy.  Relax.  Did it just all squish out this side? 
[03:10:00]  No, no, no.  His mouth looked like a fucking cappuccino.  Oh, my God.  With the brown part, too.  That's just the way he found the brown flex.  That's just disgusting, Bubby.  Yeah, well...  I'm right.  Fucking a crack addict on my butt.  Bob saw that and said, fuck it, I'm going in anyway.  No, I didn't.  I was too young.  I think I was 14.  I was too young.  I didn't know anything about pussy.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  And you were 14?  I was doing it because... 
[03:10:30]  Oh, God.  I was doing it because, you know, hey, dude, you go fucking that.  I didn't know really what I was doing or what it was all about.  I knew I had to just go...  Now you know how to fuck a retarded girl's frothy pussy.  Absolutely.  Now you know how to man up.  First of all, you'd be number one or two.  You're not number five.  No.  First of all, you're not number five.  Oh, no.  And she...  Why are you paranoid every time someone walks in?  He walks behind me and he's got a lot of wind with him.  I don't like it.  Fucking wide asshole. 
[03:11:00]  So I went over there and her...  I guess...  Now I understand.  I never understood it all these years, but now I guess her pussy...  I guess she might have came.  No.  And now when women's...  No, it was...  Oh, she did...  Well, no, what happened is she came...  I think she came and she discharged.  No, she had an infection.  Whatever it was.  And...  It shot out...  What?  Did she a squirt?  It shot out like...  Dude, not squirting.  It didn't squirt.  Squirt is too cute for what happened.  Gushed. 
[03:11:30]  Gushed is a word I'd use.  What's that gushed?  Gushed.  Uh, shot.  Okay.  And what happened was that she started peeing and the pee pushed all the four guys' thumb  out.  That's right.  And then she later had the bastard's child and five disgusting losers from Boston.  On the back of a Boston fucking...  It came out like cum oatmeal.  Oh, God.  It was piss.  I don't remember the smell at all.  I just remember that it got in my pubes. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, God damn it to hell.  Dude.  It was like somebody threw oatmeal on your box.  Look at the girl's face out there.  She is so...  You are so disgusted around.  Are you going to say aristocrats at the end of this?  This is fucking disgusting.  Yeah.  One of the listeners out there never heard anything like this finally.  It's disgusting.  My friends all laughed, though.  They were like, oh, look what happened to you, cock.  Yeah.  She didn't see it.  What was she saying or doing during...  Was she crying or sleeping or what was hers? 
[03:12:30]  I think she was saying...  Was she telling jokes or...  She was counting matchsticks on the floor.  It was 367.  367.  It was 367.  What's that match?  Oh, God.  She, uh...  She, uh...  Yeah, she just shot...  I mean, literally...  I think she actually made a move.  I remember her making a move with her pelvis in her back and it just shot.  It just gushed out.  And so then you varmited.  It was a squirter.  Yeah, I just...  I didn't know.  I thought it was egg.  I didn't know what happened.  Oh, my God. 
[03:13:00]  I didn't know what happened.  I just didn't know what happened.  Fucking caviar shot out of her.  I know.  Fucking crackers.  Fucking a hen.  Did it smell?  Did it smell?  Frout eggs.  Shot out of her.  It's horrible.  That's loads, man.  That's hilarious.  It was...  I didn't know what it was, though.  I didn't understand.  I didn't know what about a fucking vagina.  Did you taste it?  Did you taste it, Bob?  You're out of your mind, you dirty fucking piece of it.  Did you taste it?  We taste it in Britain.  Fuck off.  You should have pulled it out of your pubes and sniffed it.  Then it would have hit me a tongue. 
[03:13:30]  And then just between your two teeth, just kind of nibble on it.  Yeah.  Nibble.  Nibble.  So, wait a minute.  You guys are trying to get me to puke.  I get it.  I get it.  I get fucking stupid afro eggs in here with the camera.  You nervous...  He has a hard time holding that heavy camera.  So, she shot cunt tapioca into your balls.  That's a good one.  That's...  And then what did you do?  I'd say more rice pudding.  That tapioca's too smooth.  It was clumpy.  But the...  And then when she shot it out, she actually got nervous like she did a bad thing like she 
[03:14:00]  did it before.  Why would she get nervous?  And her father beat her for it.  Why would she get ill at ease?  Why would she get ill at ease?  Why would she shoot pussy clumps on my rug?  Oh, that made her ill at ease?  That's weird.  She must be very insecure.  Yeah, I guess.  A little uncomfortable after that.  So, watch this audio.  I really couldn't eat anything, like, for a long time after that.  It would have affected my visual.  Certainly made up for it.  All right, well, no.  That was a lot funny.  There you go.  That was a goddamn funny joke, man. 
[03:14:30]  That was a lot funnier than the response it got.  That's all I was saying.  I didn't hear it.  I think it was his excited delivery.  I know.  You sure made up for that one.  Yeah, I know.  He said I wasn't able to eat anything for the longest time.  We got it.  You sure made up for that one.  It's true.  Because he's fat, it's true.  You're going to fucking punch up his joke, make it better.  It's true, because he's a fat, so.  It's true.  He eats a lot.  So then we get to Danny.  Yeah, so this girl was...  Well, first of all, the girl was talking about... 
[03:15:00]  So all this was starting to conjure in your mind.  You were making an association to that evening.  Well, we were talking about pussy, and it started with a yeast infection.  Then this girl, I think, went into how she had a yeast infection and got cheesecloth and  put garlic in it and put it in her vagina, because someone told her that...  Yeah, the girl, Marla Schultz, I had on the show, she put garlic in her pussy to cure  a yeast infection and forgot about it.  By the way, they dumped out a spick on the other side of the show.  I just want to bring that to everyone's attention.  Yeah, yeah.  And pissed away. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, pissed away.  Just so you can understand the world we live in.  This is probably going to get dumped over there, too.  They dumped out faggot and spick.  And over here, we're talking about...  I think cunt oatmeal.  Tapioca cunt.  I think it would get dumped out, too.  All right, so let's play the audio.  So that was all in your head when this girl called your show, right?  Put cheesecloth in her box.  All right, let's listen to this.  Have you had a yeast infection?  Yes, I think every girl has had a yeast infection.  What happens?  Does your pussy expire?  No, it doesn't expire.  It's like, you know, some stinky cock probably gave you a little... 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, you probably got something from the guy, because guys have yeast infections, too.  And then what happens is it just, like, you know, cultivates, and it's, like, thick.  And it can be, like, kind of gross, you know?  What do you mean thick?  Like a milkshake?  No, like cottage cheese.  Yeah, they call it the cottage cheese disease.  Really?  Yeah, because if you pee, you look in the toilet, and there's, like, little pieces of cottage cheese.  I mean, that's the discharge. 
[03:16:30]  It's true, though.  He's going to throw up.  What's wrong with this?  It's just discharge.  You fucking, you discharge South Beach diet out of your cunt?  What the fuck?  Yeah, that's how you know you have a yeast infection, besides the smell.  Besides the smell.  Cottage cheese comes out of your vagina?  It's called the cottage cheese disease.  Does it make a plop sound when it goes in?  It's not that thick. 
[03:17:00]  It's just little pieces, little chunks.  Yeah.  It's like when you boil out raviolis for too long.  Oh, my God.  Louie, you kill this stuff.  What happens?  Nothing.  Your vagina?  What do you do for it?  You got to take medicine.  Monistat.  What is it?  Monistat.  Monistat.  So you got to go to CVS and buy Monistat.  Yeah, that's all you need.  That's just a suppository.  And you put it in your vagina.  Stick it in there.  And then what happens?  And then you actually, you actually, it's worse than, it's worse, because then a lot 
[03:17:30]  of stuff comes out.  Like what?  Like you'll be hot as cheese in the Monistat.  Wait a minute.  It all starts coming out.  Like if you're.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He really threw up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That was a lot of puke, Bobby.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Did he really puke?  Oh, my God.  Oh, all right.  Listen.  Daddy, take us the break.  Take us the break.  And we're back live.  And Louie, I noticed as he's listening, he's looking at the head.  Yeah, Louie can't listen. 
[03:18:00]  He can't listen to puking?  I can't write, not write into my ears like that.  Why?  Through headphones.  It's just, I don't know.  It makes, it unsettles my stomach to hear puking like that.  Not a lot, but, you know.  I'm not usually squeamish.  I can look at bloody things and stuff like that.  Cool.  Yeah, no problem.  Shit and puke upsets me a little bit.  Puke is bad, though.  Shit, puke, and other people's cum. 
[03:18:30]  Error and judgment, by the way.  Measured in that level.  See, that's kind of cartoony.  I don't mind that.  That's all right.  That sounds funny.  That's silly.  That's real.  Yeah, but that sounds okay.  It's Pastor Monocchi, right?  Oh, that's a little...  That last one was bad where there's no heat.  Yeah, there's just water.  Did you ever see the Sergeant Magoo video?  You know what you mean, guys?  Oh, this one, right?  Oh, Jesus.  That's a lot of puke, man.  Yeah, that's bad.  Let me see what this one sounds like. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, my God.  All right, how about this one?  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  It's a dry heave, and then you hear a little stubble.  I can't.  The thing is, also, I have a huge aversion to puke.  Like, I can't...  I hate puking.  It hurts.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I find it so painful and upsetting.  Yeah.  Like, when I have food poisoning or something, you know, if you feel food poisoning, if you  puke, it's over.  The instant you puke, I will hold it in. 
[03:19:30]  Ride it out.  Let the poison course through my veins, my whole body, and I will host that poison for  like 48 hours rather than puke.  Yeah.  And I'll just sit there shivering, run a temperature up to like 115, and fucking see my fucking feet  are turning yellow.  Doesn't it just make you puke?  I hold it down.  There's a way.  I think some people have a more like an easy switch to anti-gesticulate, I think is  what it's called.  Just fucking puke.  Yeah, but for me, puking, like, my body just, it puts me through a lot of pain. 
[03:20:00]  I'm fingers down the throat puke.  I've never been able to do that in my life.  Nope.  Never in my life been able to do that.  Right down the throat.  I hate puking.  I cry and scream when I'm puking.  I literally, like, go, no, I don't want to do that.  I have a huge problem with it.  It is weird.  No one likes it.  Oh, it's...  But there are people that can just go, bleh, I'm done.  I think it's something about how your body's made, like, your pipes work a certain way.  Some people don't go in a reverse nicely.  I've got to ask Louie, have you seen Two Girls, One Cup?  Oh, that's a good one. 
[03:20:30]  That's just silly.  Two Girls, One Cup?  Yeah, it's silly.  It's just silly.  Turn around.  Put it on all the TVs, too, because I want to see it.  Hold on.  All the TVs.  This is just silly.  It's a little Lesbo clip.  It's just silly, Louie.  It's a fucking...  I don't even think they're that hot.  They're making it out.  I don't think they're that hot.  It's on its own website.  This one clip has its own website.  Yeah.  It's just silly.  It's because they're fucking making it out.  It's silly.  Hold on.  We're putting it on all the TVs.  All right.  Just in case you turn this way, you can still see it.  Yeah.  Here we go.  All right.  Just take a look.  Please don't look away.  Okay.  Why would he?  At least he wants to jerk off. 
[03:21:00]  It's about a minute.  What are they, Brazilian girl?  Yeah.  Lesbian action.  Nice, right?  White girl.  White girl.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  That's just wrong, isn't it?  You got to watch it, man.  Wait a minute.  Dirty bitch.  Louie.  You dirty bitch.  I like Gavin's reaction.  Oh, you dirty bitch.  Gavin's cock is over right now. 
[03:21:30]  I'm twitching.  Oh, you cheeky bitch.  Bobby's not looking.  Bobby's not looking.  I don't like this.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Come on, Bobby.  I can't even look what's on the screen now.  That's not okay.  I just had a Jamba Juicer.  It's like the pink version of the same thing.  How could you not watch the most famous clip on the internet right now?  That twirled like soft serve.  It twirled in.  It twirled into the cup.  Quickly the cup filled.  The best part.  This is the part, Bobby, you guys see. 
[03:22:00]  Right after she shits.  Paul, pause this for a minute.  Okay.  Watch the asshole because it goes like this.  Mwah.  The asshole gives a kiss.  And the shit stickiness.  Which connects the shit.  It's like shit strings.  There's two strings.  Watch.  That is stinky poo.  Watch.  Wait.  Watch the last part.  And.  You see the little strings.  Bobby, look.  Bobby, look.  No, I'm not puking.  No, I'm not your fucking dumb panda.  I was the same way about this clip when I first saw it. 
[03:22:30]  You pretended something else.  And now I come out of diabetes.  I'm not fucking losing electronics for you.  But don't you think that you.  Somewhere you paid a price for the immunization.  Yes.  My sensitivity.  Now, Louie, try to get to the end of the clip, please.  Look at that.  Please.  Okay, go ahead.  We've all done it.  We've all made it to the end.  Now they're eating it.  I'm pretending it's something else.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right.  Oh, that's her shit.  You fucking.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  She's having fun with it.  I see.  Roll around in her mouth.  Look at how brown her tongue is.  Roll that around in your mouth. 
[03:23:00]  Hey, hey, Louie.  Her fucking tongue is coffee ice cream brown.  I got nothing to gain by watching that.  What do you eat to get shit like that?  Yeah, that's the other thing.  It's not the worst shit I've ever seen.  Are you going to go shopping?  She eats a cow.  That girl eats a McDonald's too much.  What do you eat to eat shit like that?  Someone else's shit.  That's like fifth generation shit. 
[03:23:30]  Is it more?  Is it more?  Is it more?  Is it more?  Is it more?  Is it more?  Is it more?  Yeah, yeah.  After eating her shit, if you kept doing that.  She's environmentally conscious.  She only recycles all that shit.  If you kept doing that just to keep somebody's shit in your mouth, and then you shit in  someone else's mouth, eventually a diamond comes out of you.  That must be like, that must be so delicious.  That's the cure for cancer.  What if that turned out to be the cure for cancer?  That people have to, like, 15 times shit in each other's mouths.  Norton would never get cancer.  No, I'd be a fucking cancer-free boy.  Stop stalling.  Let's get back to it.  What happens next? 
[03:24:00]  She's in between her teeth.  That's great, yeah.  Oh, she's smiling.  And she doesn't care.  Oh!  No way!  You dirty fucking bitch!  Look at that!  French kiss him in shit?  Yes.  Yeah, now the girls are making out.  The thing that's upsetting about it is how...  I gotta get my face!  The thing that's upsetting about it is the looks on their faces, because they don't care.  They don't care.  They are so fucking nonchalant about this.  Oh, God. 
[03:24:30]  You know what that room must smell like?  Oh, my God.  The whole room.  I'm just fooled, though.  It's not a big mystery.  It's good.  I doubt it's perfume or financial success.  It smells like a pediatrics award.  I watched it again, because I'm like, how much worse is...  How much worse can it get?  She shit into an ice cream cone, and they both ate it, and then the other one's showing  it off in her mouth.  Okay, I'll watch it.  How much worse can it get?  It's a lot worse.  All right, well, let's take a look.  You better look at the screen. 
[03:25:00]  Let's see how much worse can it get.  It's like they're making out with fucking cookie dough in their mouths.  How much do I get fucking paid for this?  Probably not a lot.  Brazil, man.  Perfume and financial success.  All right.  Fucking Jimmy, man.  Go ahead, Lloyd.  See, this is what the Writers Guild is fighting for, by the way.  These girls should be getting paid for us watching this.  These should be an Xbox.  All right.  Here we go.  Bobby, come on.  Someone had to write this, right?  Here we go.  Exactly.  I'm not going to watch this.  No, you have to. 
[03:25:30]  I'm looking there.  I'm looking there.  All right.  Look over there, Louie.  Oh, God.  Louie.  We're never going to get to the end of this.  The one girl is puking shit onto the other cup of shit.  Yes.  What do you expect you to do with it?  Gavin's going to puke.  Gavin's going to puke.  Oh, shit.  Gavin's going to puke.  Here, give him a bucket.  Don't give him a bucket.  Here's the guy's belt.  Here's the guy's belt.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  I'm going to laugh at the puke at the same time.  He's puked on the mic. 
[03:26:00]  He puked on the mic.  Now Louie's leaving the studio.  Louie just walked out.  Oh, the show's a catastrophe.  We just knocked out the 6'5", 290 pound Englishman.  He's out.  He's tapping out.  Holy shit.  What a show, man.  I need some water, man.  You need water.  That is the worst film of my fucking life.  Sam, where's your camera? 
[03:26:30]  Oh, God.  What are you not filming?  I didn't miss this.  I got it.  Oh.  Is it over?  No, no.  We're not done yet.  We're almost done.  We're almost done.  We're almost done.  This clip's over.  No, don't flip him.  No, I'm done.  I don't want to do it anymore.  No, this clip's only 45 seconds.  I don't care.  Come on.  This is like heroin.  Where's Bobby?  After a while, you'll be turning people on to this.  They'll be going, dude, you see this?  It's like you're hanging out with the cast of Waiting to Exhale.  Will you fucking man up and watch it? 
[03:27:00]  There's no reason.  I don't get paid to watch it.  It doesn't help the country.  That last part took out three guys.  It's amazing.  It's no contribution to national security.  Bob Kelly left.  The first live club all bailed out on that fucking puke.  You've never seen anybody puke on a cup of shit before?  It's sheltered.  It's sheltered.  Enjoy it.  But if I watch it, an angel doesn't get its wings because I watched some cunt puke another  cunt shit into a hot tub. 
[03:27:30]  Can we get some water for Gavin, please?  Please, man.  Choose this clip.  Gavin will at least get to the end of the clip.  We're almost there.  We're almost there.  Just don't drink coffee if you watch this, anybody.  I think we got the grand finale coming up.  The grand finale.  Where's fucking Bobby?  Where's the bin?  I'm sorry.  Bobby snuck out.  He's done.  Is he coming?  Oh, Bobby's over there.  Bobby, talk on mic.  What happened?  Bob?  Bob's in the other studio.  Bob.  At least say what happened.  How could Bobby scare us of being sick?  He's a fucking...  Oh, man.  She's just...  Thanks, buddy. 
[03:28:00]  Wow.  He put salt in her mouth right there.  Bobby started a chain effect we didn't want.  That scene is the...  That's the bad scene right there, I guess, huh?  Come on, guy.  Let's fucking man up and finish.  Yeah, man up.  Let's all man up.  Let's man up.  I'm a man in here.  Here we go.  Man up.  Let's go.  Come on.  Rally.  Here we go.  Rally time.  Come on.  Come on.  Pull it together, everybody.  All right.  Why don't we go back a little bit?  Because that's what you want to do.  Just a little.  Okay.  So that scene.  Yeah, but you've seen this already.  Yeah.  Look at the way the shit's between her teeth. 
[03:28:30]  Isn't that wonderful?  All right, come on.  I'm done looking.  She's going to need a good flossing.  With a tampon strength, right?  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Come on.  Let's all rally.  It's Friday.  Heading toward the weekend.  Here we go.  Come on, Lou.  You can do it.  Man up.  All the guys are laughing.  We saw that.  We saw that.  We've seen it.  It's only gotten better.  The French kiss with the shit.  She pukes in the fucking throat.  Or eats it. 
[03:29:00]  Flurps it up.  And then a nice shit puke right in the mouth.  What the fuck?  And close up.  Louie's out.  He's throwing the headphones down.  He's done.  He's kicking furniture over.  He's kicking the furniture over.  He's had it.  Don't wreck our studio. 
[03:29:30]  He's had it.  I love it.  Louie is not happy.  I've learned something about Louie today.  That clip made him angry.  Oh, did he get angry?  Gavin, you all right?  I can't unwatch that.  I can't unwatch that.  Louie's on Mike.  We're over there.  That's in my memory.  You can't unwatch it.  Watch your head, man.  That's it.  Yeah, that last clip.  It's irreversible damage. 
[03:30:00]  That one woman just has like Reagan's hair in her mouth.  It's hanging out.  All right, well.  Jesus.  Have you seen Lemon Party?  I like the fucking puke in the mouth.  I think it's funny that they close with the shit eating.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're like in an office where they're both receptionists or something and they got  bored.  You're probably on a break.  Yeah, you got to make it believable.  There's Lemon Party.  All right, this up scene.  Yeah, that's not them.  No, no, no.  That's nice.  I showed this to my wife once and she saw this and she said, you know what? 
[03:30:30]  That's kind of sweet.  She said it's the only pornography she's ever seen where there's no victims.  Everybody's happy here.  Look at that.  We're all winning, aren't they?  Everybody's winning here.  We're trying to figure out who is the gayest guy in that shot.  Oh, it's got to be the guy.  It's the guy who's not talking his mouth.  It's not even the gayest guy.  Here it is.  Here it is.  I think the guy paid for it.  You have to be one of these guys.  Which one is it?  The guy's sucking cock. 
[03:31:00]  The cameraman.  That's the smart answer.  But if you had to be one of those three.  I think the dude kissing, the guy whose dick isn't involved and he just has his hand on  the dude's chest.  What is he getting out of that?  His red dog dick is poking to the side.  I mean, he's going to be that than being blown by an old man or blowing an old man.  I'd rather blow.  Jack Nicklaus, we call him.  It's Jack Nicklaus.  And he's blowing Ed Koch.  Yes.  And John Witherspoon. 
[03:31:30]  Dick smells like that.  It doesn't like Thurston Howell the Third.  Thurston Howell.  Hey, Matt LaFarre writes, he wants to know if Louie would rather watch Two Girls, One  Cup or listen to Ville.  I'll Kilmer sing.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, that should be the soundtrack.  Daddy.  Hold your daddy, whatever.  Blah, blah, blah.  That's just wrong, isn't it?  I've seen much worse than that.  You've seen Meat Spin, right?  What?  Meat Spin?  No, I don't watch this kind of shit.  I just don't.  And I don't have a shit problem. 
[03:32:00]  I mean, like, I have a two-year-old and I change your diaper and it's chaos in there.  It's chaos.  It's just fucking mountains of shit.  And I clean it out of her cunts, which I've talked about on the air here.  So I don't mind, you know, vaginas and shit are natural, you know, occurrence.  One hole in the other.  But I don't know why that's so upsetting to me.  It's really just these...  You broke our eye shadow.  You broke our stuff, man.  She had this cheap blue eye shadow and this cunty look on her face.  They tend to not overspend on makeup during the fucking Brazilian shit films. 
[03:32:30]  How'd you test one of those jobs?  You've never heard this on a Brazilian shit film set.  Could you fix my lipstick?  Cut, cut, cut.  Yeah, you never hear cut.  Exactly.  Tell somebody he said something kind.  Can we do that again?  Yeah, tomorrow.  Could you hold it, please?  Or, uh, can we wait?  I have to pick up a Father's Day card?  I saw a really bad video one time.  It was a Japanese guy on his back.  And there was a toilet seat over him.  But as he was, like, mummified, and he had, like, a fucking hose attaching under the toilet. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, shit.  It came to his mouth.  And a bunch of girls were just, like, liquid shitting into it.  And you could see it, like...  Oh, shit.  Where is that?  I don't know.  Oh, I gotta see that.  It was fucking wonderful.  Hey, are we allowed to show the horse video?  That you talk about it once in a while?  I've seen that.  That I've seen, yeah.  What's this one now that we're going?  This is fucking...  This is me in a horse costume.  Fucking Amanda.  What, are they head or the ass?  We have it? 
[03:33:30]  I don't know.  Fine, Mr. Heads.  I'll just come.  What are you showing to everybody right there?  Get my breath.  What's this one?  The guy from The Wire.  I don't know.  Somebody just feedbacked it in.  What is it?  Uh, look at the...  Behind the guy talking.  Oh, there's a casket.  The dead guy.  All right, dead guy.  There seems to be...  He puked into the casket?  Oh, my God!  He puked on a dead man?  Is that real?  Fake.  He puked on a dead man?  That's fake.  Considering you can't see the actual guy vomiting.  Yeah.  That's not fake.  All right, that was a waste.  Fuck Ebon out of this world. 
[03:34:00]  How about fucking, uh...  Get the fucking, uh...  What do I type in?  Mr. Hands.  Google Mr. Hands.  Mr. Hands.  Mr. Hands.  Where are we going?  This is fucking great.  Mr. Hands.  Yeah, it's a fucking hot video, man.  I'm still...  I'll just...  That is really disgusting.  But, like, being...  I equate it to being in warfare.  Hold on.  Like, we've seen it so many times that you guys are the replacements that have come in and  you're throwing up over the bodies and we're just like, oh, guys, fucking get rid of this 
[03:34:30]  shit in your pack.  You're not going to need that in the field.  I never liked this kind of shit.  I don't, you know, like, I remember before the internet and all that, somebody tried to  show me a tape of, you know, it was in Maryland Chambers and some guy's shoving a bowling pin  up her pussy.  Like, losing a bowling pin in her pussy.  And I'm like, I don't want to see all this shit.  It's just gross.  Shit's bad.  I think in a month, you guys will be showing this video to everybody.  I'll look at anything sexual.  Yeah.  Anything.  Even the shit video.  I just don't like real violence and death shit. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, that stuff is a bummer, too.  Like, people watch the killings and beheadings.  Yeah.  I can't watch that.  Anything sexual, though, put it on.  I'll watch it.  That was the one that affected me the most.  The beheadings...  Those are bad.  ...violate you.  Like, this is gross and yuck.  But I watched Eugene Armstrong's fucking head being cut off.  Yeah.  It hits you on, like, a fucking bizarre level.  It's the worst detail I remember from those is a guy was screaming, and then they...  It goes through his throat, and the scream turns into just this wheeze.  It goes, ah! 
[03:35:30]  I didn't know that was...  Because it's not going through.  It's just air pushing out of the point.  He's trying to breathe.  Like a pig.  You sound like a pig.  Oh, God.  Why would you watch that?  And then they hold...  They always hold their head up to the camera, and it's got this dumb look on its face.  Yeah.  It's just...  He goes from, ah!  To, like...  Like he just lost the...  It looks like a moron.  It looks like he's either beheaded or he's losing a trivia show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  The blitzkrieg.  I don't have a body anymore, dude.  I'm... 
[03:36:00]  Fucking...  Fucking...  That...  Is fucking horrible.  That's what happened.  I've seen, like, still pictures of that.  Oh, my God.  I'm in this other country, and my wife, my kids, and all this profound...  And then just...  Yeah, like every...  You know what it is?  Yeah.  Your eyes don't face forward anymore.  They're kind of...  And your mouth...  Do what they want to do.  Yeah.  Oh, that is horrible.  At least you hope it's over quickly.  What an awful way to go.  Shit.  Because the thing is, they're sawing through the head with a knife.  I know. 
[03:36:30]  It's not like a guillotine where it's, like, over like that.  No, no.  Did you ever see the one that was done?  There was two people that'd beheaded out in public, and the guy...  The head won't come off, so he has to take the knife and, like, keeps chopping it through  the neck, and the head won't come off.  You must feel your neck coming away, like, coming loose.  Of course, you're going to be still struggling.  Oh, that's, like, so bad.  And your spine is still connected, so you...  That's the point he was trying to have to.  Yeah, exactly.  Until that's cut, you're alive.  Nah, you lose...  Fucking...  Once the fucking blood isn't going to your brain anymore, you're done.  Yeah, but that's the thing, is if you're cutting from the back, which they seem to usually 
[03:37:00]  do...  Oh, oh.  If you're cutting from the back.  Oh.  Well, from the front, then you lose your...  First, you're choking on blood.  Yeah.  And then you start getting really tired, a little sleepy, and weirdly, you get bored  in the middle.  Yeah.  That's worse than shit-eating video.  Then you feel like a little prankster, and you want to do wacky things, and then you wonder  where your keys are.  Yeah, then you get forgetful.  That's what happens.  You lose short-term memory.  How awful would it be if the last thing you have is, I wonder who's going to fuck my wife 
[03:37:30]  first.  Click.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  I'm telling you, who knows what your mind is.  My God, hangs up.  I'm sorry, was that a little too unpleasant for everybody?  Hey, hey, you're crossed the line.  I was just thinking about it.  That's not me to go too far.  Oh.  My problem.  Sorry.  A little far.  It's not...  And by the way, you're not married, so you don't know...  Hit the horse fucking video.  You can tell you're not married, because the last thought is, oh, my wife is a cunt.  Click.  Have we seen Pain Olympics yet? 
[03:38:00]  They keep trying to push Pain Olympics on us.  No, I don't want to see shit like that.  I don't know if we've seen Pain Olympics.  Looks nice.  I won't watch.  I don't know if we've seen it.  Why can't you watch it?  I don't know what it's about.  I don't know.  I don't like hurtful things.  I don't like painful things.  I don't like, um...  Pain Olympics.  I don't like, um...  People in pain.  No.  I like, um...  I like fucking videos.  Dude, you know what video we should show these...  You know what video we should show these guys?  Out on the limb there, Anthony.  The guy...  Are you really?  The guy, uh, uh...  Smashing in his own fucking butt plug with his dick. 
[03:38:30]  That's funny.  That's just funny.  That is hilarious.  That's just silly is what that is.  Go to eatabuddle.com.  Eatabuddle.com.  I was too excited.  You wanted to get that out.  You're almost acting, too.  Go to eatabuddle.com.  I can't read you.  Mr. Faber-Shan, go to eatabuddle.com.  Eatabuddle.  Eatabuddle.  Ah, fucking you are.  What are you...  Oh, go fuck yourself. 
[03:39:00]  Where, uh, time is...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, we're getting out of here.  11 seconds.  Where's Mr. Hands?  It's, uh...  What are you fucking on a dial-up?  Get it!  Our 40K connection.  Ooh.  Oh!  Judo Fan just came out.  That look Fan gave.  Jimmy might earn him an email.  With his strike beard.  Uh-oh.  It's pretty scary.  All right.  In the playoffs, it's either going to be the video or a horrific virus.  Let's help it's both.  Yeah.  All right.  This is the video. 
[03:39:30]  All right.  Deep thrust.  That's a deep thrust.  Yeah, this doesn't bother me.  Oh, this is the horse, right?  This stuff gets me down.  I've seen the horse.  Yeah, yeah, it's fun.  Watch how eager the horse is to push that big dick into this fella.  Is Mr. Hands the horse?  No, Mr. Hands the guy that died.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Now...  There he goes.  Look at this silly rascal.  What an awful ass.  All right.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  No way.  And this guy dies.  Now, this guy's supposed to keep the horse's dick from going all the way in.  What?  That's what his buddy's doing.  Oh, God. 
[03:40:00]  He's going like, don't worry.  I got it.  I got it.  Don't worry.  I got it.  Look at the little clothes pins on his balls.  But now the horse says, you know, I mean business.  He's got clothes...  Oh.  Oh.  He's burying it.  Look at his asshole coming out with the dick.  Stop him.  How could his legs have been...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, it shot a fucking hopper.  The horse is like, I don't get to come in him?  You fucking...  Yeah.  The horse has no dick control.  So he has clothes pins on his...  Was that Gavin on your couch? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  What was that?  So he's got clothes pins on his balls.  Because without those, like, this wouldn't really feel...  He wouldn't feel nothing.  Otherwise, you'd feel silly.  Otherwise, it's just like, so what a horse is talking to me.  What a dope.  The other guy is thinking he could control the horse with one fucking hand.  It's a fucking horse.  Holding the horse's dick back with one hand.  He's definitely not...  I ain't watching it.  All right.  I ain't watching.  This is the Pain Olympics.  Oh, Pain Olympics.  Why does a guy have a cutting board, a knife, and his dick is out? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, that's all I gotta say.  This is what happens when you fuck a chick with the cottage cheese.  There you go.  What's he having?  He's just shaving a little bit.  No big deal.  What is he doing?  Just tapping his dick with a knife.  It's a fucking child's play.  It's the Pain Olympics.  He's tying his balls up.  He's tying his balls up.  And time.  It's like rodeo dick.  Tying it up in a little rope.  Look at that.  Look at his little fucking penis. 
[03:41:30]  No big deal, see?  Oh, wait a minute.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  What's he gonna do?  What's he gonna do?  What's he gonna do?  That's fake.  No, that's fake.  Fake, dude.  Fake, fake.  It's all fake.  It's all fake.  Now you can watch it, fake.  It's fake.  It's fake.  I've done that.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  That's fake.  That's fake.  That might not be fake.  That's fake.  That might not be fake, dude.  Fake, shut up.  You can tell by the way he's sitting right there. 
[03:42:00]  Fake.  Oh, yeah, I'm done.  Is that fake?  I don't know what that one is.  Jesus Christ.  That's goddamn real.  That looks like my grandmother's pussy.  Ah, you dirty fuck.  Maybe that might be real.  Wait a minute.  That looks real.  That might be real.  Oh, okay.  He cut his balls out.  That's real.  Covering his eyes.  I'm done.  Dude, that's real.  His balls came out.  They're so cute.  His fucking balls.  Is that fake or real?  How can it be fake?  Who did this?  I don't know.  Are you getting fucking...  Dreamworks?  Dirty fingernails. 
[03:42:30]  High production.  Dreamworks.  Why?  CGI magic.  The guy had fucking grit in his fingernails.  This is real.  He could get an infection.  Yes.  What are you getting back to Rachel Ray now?  Yep.  They're cooking the same thing on her show.  You know what?  We gotta get out of here.  Yeah.  There's nowhere else to go after that.  I got shit to do.  But home.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  So don't forget, you can see Patrice at Levittown at Governors, Bob Kelly tonight, tomorrow,  Sunday, Caroline's, and January 18th, his Comedy Central special comes out.  Which you'll be in before then anyway.  And of course, Louis C.K. in Miami Wednesday.  Knoxville and Louisville this weekend.  Knoxville and Louisville.  And then you got Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit over the February 14th, 15th, 16th.  And I want to plug for myself, just look up my MySpace.  I got a bunch of gigs I'm doing.  One's in Minnesota, which is almost sold out. 
[03:43:30]  And Cleveland, second show is almost sold out.  Very cool.  That's all I gotta say to you fucks.  All right.  You guys want to do line of the day?  Denver, not so good.  There were so many.  Albany could be better.  There were just so many lines of the day.  I will do line of the day.  Every line.  I'm not reading all that.  BodogFantasy.net gives you line of the day.  A listener won four grand from them.  And they got a trip to Vegas they're giving away right now if you go to BodogFantasy.net.  There you go. 
[03:44:00]  Runner-up line of the day.  But Torgasm was dumping really hard.  There was one point where Torgasm would go down and then a shitty movie with whoever in it.  Jan Michael Vincent?  Yeah, like a Jan Michael Vincent movie that came on after.  Very nice.  Nice reference.  It's charitable.  Somebody doesn't like Jan Michael Vincent.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, what did Jan Michael Vincent do?  Did you step on your toes one time?  Did you just move on?  The show's almost nervous.  Who is?  A judgmental Muppet.  I'm teasing, of course.  It's not like he nominated himself. 
[03:44:30]  Somebody else back there did it.  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  Another runner-up line of the day.  We're amazing at that.  What do you mean we're?  I don't understand why you keep grouping yourself in, Spick.  You're a red-headed plumber.  You're a farmer.  Yeah, but see, that's the thing.  That's how great...  Go pick my spinach.  Stop with the weed.  Go pick my spinach.  Patrice was sick today. 
[03:45:00]  Yes.  Patrice is such a racist.  He was a trooper.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, because he's a filthy Mexican.  He doesn't deserve anything.  Go back to Mexico and get a computer.  Go back to Mexico and invent a computer out of beans, you fucking smelly spick.  Jesus.  Wow, the fucking Hispanics took quite a beat today.  Yes.  In your hands.  Breaking my dad's heart today.  Yet again.  The final runner-up line of the day. 
[03:45:30]  Do you care about any black people?  Any black stories on there?  What's that?  Some kid from Compton that lost his Air Force One.  No, I don't.  Any black cry stories?  No, no.  Any black kid came in and stole all the cases and ran off of them?  That's what...  Hey.  Gavin, you good?  Everyone good?  I feel good.  Yeah, I'm enjoying my smoothie.  All right, we're going to do the laundry.  It's like puking shit.  Ugh.  Ew.  Was it a dead animal in the bathroom, by the way?  From you?  No, an animal's dead in that bathroom. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, it smells like a fucking zoo.  No, there's a dead rat up in the rafters.  Oh, that little fella.  Something's dead in there.  Yeah.  It's all right.  Yeah.  Just don't eat your egg salad in there.  Just saying.  Trying to give advice, everybody's looking at me.  Here's your light of the day.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day. 
[03:46:30]  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Two tin cans and a string.  It's strung between a black guy and a white guy.  Nothing's going to help.  You're just going to get trapped.  Black people got to stop stealing, and gay people have to stop hurting God.  And you have to stop manipulating the media.  Gregorio!  Louie C.K.  Light of the day!  Very good.  That's funny.  And that's how we end it. 
[03:47:00]  And have a great weekend.  Yes.  In Mohegan?  Yes, I will.  Safe flight!  Thank you, sir.  We should have a few good stories on Monday, huh?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I'll be in Monday.  I'm going to see Diana Ross.  You will be here.  Yes.  Sorry.  I hate that.  I said I hope they don't Thurman Munson and his plane.  No.  Canton, Ohio.  Sorry.  At least not on the way back if I won.  It would really suck.  All right. 
[03:47:30]  We're out of here.  Bye.  Bye.  It's Flea Man from Westchester.  I love Jim Norton because of his brutal honesty, his hilarious commentary on society, and that  he likes to kill, rape, and eat people and admits it.  Do you have any fantasies about Jim?  I'd like to be in between him and Rich Voss and have them flip a coin to decide who fucks  me.  Fucks me.  Fucks me.  Fucks me.  I'll be in heaven. </pre>
