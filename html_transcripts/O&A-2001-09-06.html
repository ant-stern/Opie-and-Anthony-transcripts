<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered their experience at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs).  The show began in the studio with Opie and Anthony playfully conducting a viewer's choice award vote, with Anthony sabotaging it for comedic effect.  A caller, Dennis, recounted a fun night at a Tim Brewer comedy show, prompting the hosts to plug Brewer's performances.  They then connected with their correspondent, Paul, at the VMAs. Paul described the stringent security, including cell phone confiscation, and offered snarky commentary on celebrities like Carson Daly and Diddy.

The main focus shifted to introducing "Lady Di" and "Marianne," two listeners deemed "retarded Laverne and Shirley," whom Opie and Anthony brought along as their "dates" and designated interviewers. The hosts heavily mocked their attire and appearance, but the women participated good-naturedly.  Opie and Anthony coached them on asking celebrities, including Britney Spears, NSYNC, Suge Knight, P. Diddy, Bono, and Christina Aguilera, often suggesting outrageous or provocative questions.  After this preparation, Opie and Anthony left the studio to join their co-hosts at the VMAs.  Before leaving, they recounted a humorous incident involving crew member Earl falling down.

The broadcast continued live from the VMAs red carpet, with Opie and Anthony, Lady Di, Marianne (and, according to one segment, Mel), and Jim Norton present. They made crude jokes about the appearance of attendees, particularly women and their clothing ("hip huggers").  They speculated about Carson Daly's relationship and made sarcastic remarks about his easy job.  Norton recounted a story about sneaking into the MTV ladies' room.  A significant, vulgar bit centered around the discovery of a sanitary pad in one of the female co-hosts' purses, leading to a prolonged discussion about menstruation and related topics.  They interacted with press members from publications like Entertainment Weekly, Seventeen, Tiger Beat, and Premiere, utilizing Lady Di and Marianneâ€™s unconventional interview style.

Further interactions with press and the anticipation of celebrity arrivals dominated the broadcast.  They mentioned Frank Caliendo as a friend. The tone remained irreverent and sexually charged, filled with crude humor and offensive language.  Another segment showed the hosts almost getting ejected for a misunderstanding involving a vacuum cleaner bag and an insult.  This segment featured continuous crude jokes and insults targeted at Lady Di and Marion, using derogatory terms and mocking their physical attributes.  Sexually suggestive comments and references to drugs and sexual acts were frequent.  They attempted interviews but mostly relied on crude humor.  A Rockaway Bedding commercial aired.  A brief, unsuccessful interaction with someone they believed to be Suge Knight occurred.  The segment ended with more commentary on Lady Di and Marion and a promise of further audio, including interviews with the "Real World" cast, the following day.

The final segment on the red carpet showed Opie and Anthony repeatedly misidentifying celebrities, mistaking several people for Jay-Z and Cisco of City High. A publicist aggressively prevented them from interviewing City High and other celebrities. Their attempts at interaction were largely met with hostility and avoidance.  They speculated about the presence of Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, and Jennifer Sisson. The segment ended abruptly, with the hosts unsure if they were still on air and promising to play back the audio the next day, which also included Mario Cantone as a guest.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's Opie and Anthony. It's Opie and A-Hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go ask yourself, Opie.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show in the New York area.  877-692-1027. Anywhere else, please give us a call.  866-277-4.  Wow. Stained, of course, Anthony. Fade.  Yes.  Will they be bringing home some moon men tonight at the BMAs? 
[00:00:30]  I'm going to exercise my right to vote on the viewer's choice right now, Opie.  Backstreet Boys, Nelly, Destiny's Child, Limp Bizkit, NSYNC, or Eve.  Let's see.  I'm just hoping you pick the right band here.  NSYNC.  What?  There you go.  I'm going to F up the program.  I don't care.  Are you trying to be wacky? 
[00:01:00]  I don't care who wins.  I just voted for NSYNC.  You're such a fag.  And by one vote, the winner, NSYNC.  Dare to drink.  Hey, Dennis, what's up?  Boys.  Hello, boys.  Hey, boys.  Yes, boys.  B-b-b-boys.  Boys.  Tim Brewer last night.  Yes.  Oh, my Lord.  I've got quite the potty mouth, so I'm going to try and keep it clean.  First off, let me take you guys. 
[00:01:30]  I'm the long-haired tool with the Red Giants cap.  Oh, yeah.  What's up?  Anthony, Tin Wind.  Yes, of course.  Oh, yeah, brother.  The old bands from way long ago.  First off, you two are the most down-to-earth, coolest guys flat out anywhere.  Shut up.  You're going to ruin it.  I guess our stand-ins we sent to Brewer last night did a good job of.  Okay, enough about that.  It was funny.  We're hanging.  I was just hanging in the crowd. 
[00:02:00]  Man, I can't believe you guys actually hang in the crowd.  What are you kidding?  Of course we do.  That's ridiculous.  But the Brewer Show, enough about that.  Don't look at me.  Don't look at me.  That's a great one.  Don't look at me.  Don't look at me.  Tell them not to look at me.  Unvert your eyes.  Tell the interns not to look at me.  Not to look at me.  That is funny.  But the Brewer Show.  Yeah.  Oh, my Lord.  If any of the other markets, when Brewer comes to your town, you are stupid if you don't go. 
[00:02:30]  There was a rock and roll party last night, Denny.  I laughed my balls off.  Brewer, a man that obviously growing up wanted so bad to be in a band.  To be a rock star.  To be a rock star.  So now he's taken his comedy act on the road with musical accompaniment.  And he just unloaded into ACDC.  It's great.  How much could Brewer have been a singer in any metal band in the 80s?  I know.  I don't know what he was thinking. 
[00:03:00]  He should have done it.  I don't know how he's going to be able to play tonight up in Boston.  Boston, you listening?  All right, Dennis, I'm going to let you go.  Dennis is like, his rhythm is throwing me off.  Yes.  It's not happening, Dennis.  Lack thereof.  He's stop and go, stop and go, stop and go.  Thank you for the call, Dennis.  Basically, what do you want to say is that if you're in the Boston area, tonight he's playing  B.C., O and A are going to be represented very nicely up there in Boston.  So go hang with Brewer and a bunch of our insane listeners, okay? 
[00:03:30]  Very cool.  The thing I want to say about Brewer, it was a great show last night.  It was a different show for Brewer because he's doing the music thing as well.  Yeah.  Very cool.  I just don't see his voice lasting 40 days.  If this guy can tour like this and scream for the entire length of the tour, he is truly  a Superman.  Right.  Because I can't see him not blowing his voice out.  Right.  He's doing ACDC.  Judas Priest.  Judas Priest.  He's screaming. 
[00:04:00]  Metallica.  Yeah.  Metallica.  Pretty cool, though.  Ben just handed me a note.  They're heading out WOW stickers after the Brewer show tonight in Boston.  Cool.  That's very, very cool.  Okay.  I guess that's all we can spend on Brewer because we are very busy.  We're leaving the studio in about 20 minutes.  Yeah.  We're going to be leaving the studio, going a short little 10-minute walk, I guess, or  so.  Yeah.  Over to the Video Music Awards.  Paul, speaking of the Video Music Awards, Paul.  Yo. 
[00:04:30]  What's up, man?  Yo, guys, hold on a second.  All right.  I'm at CRO right now.  They just started.  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  We're watching it.  We see clapping and stuff.  Where are you?  Yeah, okay.  If they catch me, they're going to kick me out.  They just told all people with cell phones that they'll kick people out.  Security's here.  I see WNEW.  I just saw Earl.  They're hanging out, like, literally right there.  Earl stole Puffy.  Hold on one second.  I've got to hide the phone.  All right.  Earl stole Mother F and Puffy.  Yeah, we're going to talk to Earl in a minute.  He came back.  All right.  You see where they put us there? 
[00:05:00]  All right.  The security is seriously ridiculous.  Paul?  Paul?  Yeah.  He's in the audience of TRL.  Paul?  Yeah.  What's going on, Opie?  You see where we're going to be hanging out?  Yeah, I see.  Hold on.  It's literally about 10 feet diagonally from me.  Okay.  All right.  Is it going to look like it's a good location for getting some of the people when they come  in?  Oh, dude, it's literally right there, like, right by the opening, by the red carpet,  the Metro Opera House.  Nice.  I don't see Earl there, though.  No, Earl's right here.  He was there earlier.  Dude, Earl is right here. 
[00:05:30]  Earl came back to the party.  He had to set some stuff up, and then he came back.  Dude, seriously?  Yeah.  And he was like, Earl, why are you all black, dude?  Like, seriously, it's hot as hell out.  That's why he's all black Earl.  I know.  I realized that for the first time.  Carson Bailey is about five feet from me.  He's not talking to anyone.  What a geek.  From that close, can you sense his lack of talent?  Oh, absolutely.  And he's wearing a book bag as if that's the style.  A big black book bag, but probably, like, cotton in it.  Man, we're not happy. 
[00:06:00]  And we need book bags if we're going down to VMAs.  I know.  What else is going on down there, Paul?  All right.  Well, I'm hiding right now.  I'm trying to get in the pit.  You got Carson Bailey, Hillary, can I say S-C-A-N-K on the radio?  Skank?  Yeah, because her last name is Shwink, but I call her Skank.  This guy's good.  Hey, isn't that that chick with the curly hair?  Yeah, yeah.  She's kind of cute, though, huh?  Yeah, she's absolutely cute, but she just won't talk to anybody.  Oh, wait, wait.  Do I hide? 
[00:06:30]  Wait, hold on one second.  Look, we got to hide people.  The guy's hiding.  I got people.  I got ONA fans surrounding me, like, hiding me.  This is freaking awesome, man.  Oh, I love it.  I want to get in the show.  I don't know how, man.  This sucks.  You should know I got a gun and run in.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we're going to be heading down there soon, though.  Yeah, Paul, we're going to, I think we're going to hang up.  No, we'll put you on hold.  Stay there.  We'll go through.  You want me to stay here?  Yeah, hold on.  I really appreciate it.  Hey, is Otto and George on your show today by any chance? 
[00:07:00]  No, we're going to be down with you guys.  Die, die.  Get in the coffin.  Die, get in the coffin.  All right.  He'll be on soon, though.  This guy's good.  He's in the audience for TRL right now at the VMAs.  Paul, they're taking away people's cell phones.  Why would they do that?  I don't know.  Probably they know the setup.  Like, all right, I'm watching right now.  Okay, go be a jackass.  You know?  Right.  Oh, well.  Earl, you saw Puffy?  Earl, how's Puffy?  You saw P. Diddy?  P. Diddy.  P. Diddy.  Surrounded by lots of security.  Really?  Yes.  I wonder why.  I wonder why. 
[00:07:30]  I wonder why.  Could it be if somebody got out of prison?  Is he supposed to be there?  I don't know.  Shug Knight?  Shug Knight?  I don't know.  I love it.  You know something?  He's not fond of that, man.  I love it, though.  I love the wrath battles like this because they usually end in death.  It's not like, you know, the old days where you'd have these pussy hair bands screaming at each other  and maybe getting a little scratching match backstage.  You'd punch Axel real fast.  Yeah, something like that.  You never see the things happen, you just hear later that, you know, Axel was yelling at Nirvana at one of the VMAs 
[00:08:00]  or this happened or that, you know, and then they go on stage and call them names, things like that.  No, you need gunfire to make a really good fight.  Yeah, these guys don't mess around.  It's like a WWF plot line.  Now Shug's out of prison and who knows what's going to happen, you know?  So Puffy, what time did you see Puffy?  This was about 1.30.  1.30.  What's that, 12 days before the event?  He's in there, secure, making sure he's not walking in public. 
[00:08:30]  He signed a couple of autographs and then, like, the security guys were like,  we got to get out of here now.  Unbelievable.  Well, all right.  Maybe we'll see P. Diddy later on.  Let's go back to Paul and see if anything's going on.  Paul?  Yeah, I'm here.  Anything going on?  Hold on.  Let me see, oh, still no talent from Carson Daly.  We are going to be face-to-face with him today, I'm sure.  Oh, man.  Wait.  Is there anything, is there any way that, like, I, like, I, seriously, because if I pop my 
[00:09:00]  head up, I'm crouching down right now.  I'm looking between two girls behind through a little hole.  Well, not that hole, but, uh.  Take a quick whiz.  And, yeah, I can't see anything.  If I pop up, they're, like, if we catch anybody to be your buddy with cell phones, we'll kick  you out of here faster than you could say, and then she pauses it, she's going to say  something clever, and then she goes, damn.  I'm like, okay.  All right.  All right, sorry I said that, guys.  Ruin the show.  All right. 
[00:09:30]  No, you're pretty good, Paul.  It was more that your phone was crapping out.  I'm doing a lot better than when I was on the show last time.  You're doing all right, Paul.  Very good.  All right, hold on.  All right.  Well, I guess we should make our big announcement, Anthony.  Our big announcement, yes.  We pulled it off.  Yes, we did.  Yeah, you might as well get them.  Go get them.  Right now, people like saying either yes or no.  Oh, no.  You know, yesterday we were trying to convince these two to come in and get on the red carpet 
[00:10:00]  with the Opie and Anthony show and conduct some of the interviews in their own inimitable  style, which is retard, babbling, idiot style.  They said they couldn't make it because of work.  But you know something?  They came through for their dons.  And here they are.  Hi.  Lady Di and Marianne.  Lady Di and Marianne.  Laverne and Shirley.  How's everything?  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Hey, how was your vacation?  Good.  It was always wonderful.  But we're not here to talk about that.  We're here to talk about the Video Music Awards, which you two will be at in just a little 
[00:10:30]  while with us conducting interviews.  Sort of like our dates.  It is.  It is.  Okay.  Opie.  Sort of like our dates.  Opie.  Opie.  Okay.  Slow down.  That's cool with me.  And I think we're double dating.  Oh, stop me.  We are double dating with the Retarded Laverne Show.  What?  It's got to be said.  Oh, I can see the sig pics now.  What?  What?  I want the one with the big pocket book.  Hello.  We both have big pocket books.  We both have big pocket books. 
[00:11:00]  Which ones?  Okay.  Okay, Laverne.  All right, ladies.  Let's start with the obvious.  Oh, come on.  Okay.  Where's the...  Oh, come.  Where's the big ragu?  Where's the what?  Where's the outfits?  This is right here.  Yeah.  Now, wait a minute.  We wanted the gowns.  We don't have the gowns.  The long dresses.  We would have gotten you gowns.  Do we look like we go to balls and stuff?  We don't go to balls.  You know what I mean?  Balls.  Stay away from you, too.  We really don't go to balls.  I'm sure.  You can't write fun of your stuff in that. 
[00:11:30]  We don't go dining and dancing.  I mean, we don't have to go dining and dancing.  Can we enjoy that line a little longer?  A little longer.  The balls.  We really don't.  Do you go before the ball and move the chairs off the dance floor?  We don't go dining and dancing.  Are people sitting down and missing the chairs that you didn't move today?  I have.  Like your job?  No?  All right.  You just don't go to balls.  I have dresses, too, but...  But this is the same stuff we see you guys in?  Yeah.  They're usually here.  This is a big, glamorous event.  You never saw us in shoes. 
[00:12:00]  This is a glamorous event.  You never saw us in dress pants.  That's dress pants.  Yeah.  How long did it take the blacksmith to nail those on your feet?  Hey, Jim, where's your dress pants?  Yeah, where's your dress pants?  Where's your dress clothes?  Hey, buddy, where's your dress clothes?  All right, listen.  Let's see the shoes.  Where's your dress clothes?  Right here.  Let's see the shoes.  Left up there.  Right there.  What the hell is that?  There's the shoes.  There you go.  They're both the same pair. 
[00:12:30]  You're wearing the same shoes.  Oh, my.  They're wearing the same pair.  Two for one.  I wear a nine and a half.  Two for one.  I wear a nine and a half.  I would say those are what I would call smart slacks you're wearing.  Thank you.  Those are very smart slacks.  It was either that or the leather pants.  And what do you call the top that you're wearing there, Lady Di?  I call it a blouse.  It's a blouse that you have a smart little belt around the middle.  All right, hold on.  What?  Did that belt ever say hardcore champion on it?  No?  No.  The little duct tape or metal?  No, no, no.  Okay, just wondering. 
[00:13:00]  What I like about the belt, it separates the bunt nicely.  It's just two sections.  That's it.  There's like a top section of the bunt and now a bottom.  Oh, no, Lady Di, put it back on.  Put it back on.  But it looks much better on.  Okay.  Yeah, it really does.  It holds everything together.  Yeah.  Now, listen.  Lady Di.  Yes.  All kidding aside, how old are you?  How old am I?  Yeah.  A little bit younger than Anthony.  You can be honest.  You're in your 30s, right?  All right.  Yeah, both in our 30s.  You are too young to be wearing blouses.  Right.  Absolutely.  What?  You're too young to be wearing that. 
[00:13:30]  My aunts, my mom, they wear blouses.  That was your turn.  It was my turn.  It's my turn.  He always picks on my clothes.  Now it's your turn.  What do you mean?  Could you imagine these girls are going to be on the red carpet?  Besides that, there are dates.  They got to dress a little better than this.  Well, my shirt.  Well, how would you have this dress?  We wanted gowns.  We wanted, like, rock star.  You've got to understand something.  I want to tell you one thing.  I'll get a sign.  With the gowns, when Rick called us up last night, Rick said, if you've got a pair of dress  pants, wear them.  No, no.  We were looking for it.  Did you ever watch the Academy Awards on television? 
[00:14:00]  Hey, you guys didn't call us.  Marion, hold on.  Could you listen to me for one second?  Yeah.  Did you ever watch the Academy Awards on television?  Yeah, why?  Now, do you see the red carpet when the people are walking up?  What do we think of Melissa and Joan Rivers?  Do you see the way the women are dressed?  We're not like, what are you wearing today's stuff?  But you could ask stuff like that, though.  We don't wear Ashley Stewart clothes.  And you should be wearing those kind of dresses and gowns and the jewelry.  For what?  Because that's what they wear on the red carpet.  I got the jewelry.  You got the bling bling.  You know what?  They wear it on the red carpet.  They wear it when they're in their 60s and 70s. 
[00:14:30]  We're not in their 60s and 70s.  Listen, man.  No, no.  You guys didn't even do your hair.  You didn't even do your hair.  I did.  My hair got cut a couple weeks ago.  If you don't wear the blouse, you should go to the beauty parlor.  The parlor.  The parlor.  Go to the parlor.  Hey, Opie, you need a shave.  You need a shave.  No, I don't need a shave.  Well, we're just there as a technical backing for you guys.  You guys are the stars.  You guys are the stars.  Rick looks pretty good.  Rick's there.  We don't look too bad.  We're not in shirts.  Right, Rick?  We're not in T-shirts.  Rick is on ass. 
[00:15:00]  We're not in jeans.  You guys are wearing the same crap you usually wear.  This is exactly what you wear when you come in.  This is supposed to be a special occasion.  No, no, no.  I never wore it.  It's the same type of clothing you wear when you come in every time.  We were looking for something flat.  We were looking for a flash.  She wears T-shirts.  I don't wear T-shirts.  I wear T-shirts a lot.  You're disappointing us.  I don't wear T-shirts.  Are you familiar with some of the acts that are going to be in front of you?  Oh, yeah.  Actually, Britney Spears.  Sort of.  She don't wear clothes.  Things like that.  She don't wear clothes?  You know, P.D. 
[00:15:30]  She walks around half nude.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  That's high.  Not high.  Yeah, but she's 19 years old.  Do you want us to walk around half nude?  She's 19 years old.  We're 30.  She's 39.  Marion, what is it going to take to hoist the boobs up a little higher, at least?  I did.  No, you didn't.  I lost weight.  Can you adjust the bra strap or something?  They're a little low.  I lost weight.  Can we pull up the bra straps?  Yeah.  There you go.  Pull up.  You want to do that?  Pull up her boobs a little bit.  That's better.  Oh, no.  She could do it herself. 
[00:16:00]  What's wrong?  I don't know if we have time, but Rick, would you take them shopping, maybe?  Sure, Rick.  You want to do that?  Oh, yeah, right.  Take us to Camry.  We want to do this thing, Camry.  Where's the women's store around here?  People don't have gowns.  I think about a block away, there's a discount ladies store we could probably hit.  I am not wearing a gown.  I am not wearing a gown.  An old prom dress?  Can we put a peanut hat on you?  A bridesmaid?  Where's the peanut hat?  I'll wear the peanut hat.  You'll wear the peanut hat?  I'm going to Florida Monday, so. 
[00:16:30]  I'm going to a saddle in a feed bag.  Why don't we put a suit on Jim Norton?  Yeah, there you go.  A jacket and a tie.  He isn't the stars.  You two are the stars.  You two are the stars.  So is he.  All right, listen.  He's a comedian.  He's a star.  Okay, listen.  This is what we get, unfortunately, so we'll have to deal with that, okay?  Okay, no problem.  Did you guys prepare for your interviewing today?  No, no, no.  Who are we interviewing?  Can I ask you something?  This is fair in a moment with you guys.  You guys called us up yesterday, which was great.  We appreciate it.  But we have no clue what's going on.  We don't even watch MTV anymore. 
[00:17:00]  Marion, a little advice.  Open your mouth a little wider.  We don't even watch MTV anymore.  This is perfect.  The last time we watched MTV, it was the monkey special.  They have no clue.  Remember the monkey special?  That is perfect.  Monkeys.  All right.  Great City Rollers.  I have a question.  The Beatles.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ladies.  Hold on.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Put down the beer.  Put down the Sam Adams.  Calm down.  All right, listen.  What are you going to ask Suge Knight if he's in front of you?  Who?  Suge Knight.  Who's that?  Suge Knight. 
[00:17:30]  I know what P. Diddy looks like.  Well, what are you going to say to P. Diddy?  What would you say to, what would you ask P. Diddy?  You see P. Diddy walking.  You go, P. Diddy, P. Diddy.  He walks over to you.  Now it's your chance to ask P. Diddy something.  He's got his own clothing line starting off in the fall.  So you would ask him about that?  Yeah.  You'd say, how's the clothing line going?  And are you wearing a P. Diddy right now?  Very good.  And any black artist that comes up, ask them, where were you when you heard Aaliyah had died?  A who?  Aaliyah.  Aaliyah.  Aaliyah.  No, I don't say that. 
[00:18:00]  No, I'm not going to say anything about that.  I will not say that.  You don't talk about somebody.  No, you just say it's somber.  Yeah.  No.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  You got to be serious.  We do have the hardcore belt.  No.  Hey, Lady Di, could you put the hardcore belt on?  The hardcore belt?  Right there.  Oh, no.  From the WWF?  The WWF hardcore belt.  How do we get that?  We're going to give that away on a future show.  Yeah?  Does it look better now?  Wait a minute.  We should have her wear that.  It's your accent, your bunt.  Thank you so much, Joey. 
[00:18:30]  The hardcore bunt.  The hardcore bunt.  Jesus.  We should have got them, too.  Jennifer Lopez dresses.  I know.  Perfect.  That would have been nice.  This is cool.  We do have dresses at home.  It doesn't matter.  We needed it today.  We needed it today.  There's something you wear when it's cold.  All right, what are you going to say to NSYNC if they stop by?  No, we love those guys.  All right.  All right.  What are you going to say to them?  What are you going to say?  We love their music.  That's what you're going to say to them?  Their music's not too bad.  You wouldn't ask any questions? 
[00:19:00]  No.  You're a journalist.  You have to ask a question.  Yeah, like something about maybe are they working on a new video?  There you go.  Something like that.  Are they very excited about their nomination?  What about the factory boy?  That guy that was in rehab?  Who's that?  Is he out of rehab?  There you go.  There's a great hard-hitting question.  Hard-hitting question.  And I'm sure they'll love to hear the question with just alcohol breath going all over him.  That'll be an added twist, Marion.  I like it.  Barbara Walters, look out.  All right.  How about if you see Mariah Carey, if she gets out of the night? 
[00:19:30]  No, she's in the nuthouse.  We heard she's back in the hospital.  Yeah.  That's what we read.  That's what I read.  How about you two?  You're familiar with you two?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Anything you would like to ask Bono or the Edge?  I saw him on concert a couple years ago at a giant stadium.  And what would you say?  Well, Bono's father just died a couple weeks ago.  So you would give your condolences?  Bono, Bono, Bono, Bono.  Bono.  He was cute.  Bono.  Stupid.  Bono.  Bono.  Something he will not have if he sees you. 
[00:20:00]  That's not nice.  That's real nice.  I thought we were doing Karnak or something.  Go back to Istanbul.  She got you.  All right.  How about Christina Aguilera?  Christina Aguilera walks past you.  What do you do?  You go, Christina, Christina.  She comes over.  Boom.  What do you say?  Well, what she looks like.  I know what she looks like.  She looks like anorexic Dee Schneider.  Yeah, that's true.  Ed?  That is true.  What would you say to her?  I don't know.  What's her latest? 
[00:20:30]  How do you like your latest video?  Yeah, that's good.  That's perfect.  That's perfect.  We have to be in the situation.  All right.  How about this?  We don't watch MTV.  How about you ask her how Fred Durst tastes?  Oh, that's a good one.  The who?  How does Fred Durst taste?  Have you ever had a limp biscuit in your mouth?  We don't watch MTV.  Ask her that.  The last time we saw MTV, the monkeys had a special going on over there.  Oh, well, they were.  They had a special going on over there.  They had a special going on over there.  And now, what a coincidence. 
[00:21:00]  We're sending a couple of monkeys to the VMA.  That's Anthony.  All right, let's go.  Hey, I can say one thing.  We're trying to get...  Go ahead.  I'm familiar with the MTV people that did that.  That's the MTV.  Yeah.  The VJs that you want to call them?  Yeah.  Back in the 80s.  Back in the 80s.  J.J., Martha Quinn, Mark Wood, Goodman, Goodman, whatever, Anita Blackwood.  Mr. Woodman.  Yeah, Mr. Woodman.  Hey, he does something on the health channel now.  Oh, really?  He does.  He does a spot finder or a spot.  This is perfect, Delphi.  The health channel.  Perfect.  Do you know Missy Elliott? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, Missy Elliott.  We did want one of you in a garbage bag, but...  Yeah, if you're dressed in a garbage bag...  Who's that?  If Lady Di dressed in a garbage bag, you would look like the white Missy Elliott.  Who's Missy Elliott?  She's an artist for a video, best video of the year award.  Do you want to say something?  Only one day a week, I listen to music.  One day a week.  And that's a Sunday.  Sunday.  What do you listen to on Sundays?  What kind of music do you listen to?  You like the rock and roll, do you?  What kind of music do you listen to on Sundays? 
[00:22:00]  I like guac, disco.  Do you shove cheesecake into your mouth while listening to polka music?  We don't eat cheesecake.  I don't eat cheesecake.  Oh, yeah, that's obvious, as you pat your big belly.  All right, Moby comes by.  What do you say to Moby?  Moby, he's a whale.  I don't know if we did.  All right, well, there you go.  How about Fat Boy Slim?  Fat Boy Slim, there you go.  Up for video of the year.  We heard of them.  I heard of them.  You heard of them?  Hey, they're rap music.  We're not into rap. 
[00:22:30]  They're not rap music.  All right, you tell Fat Boy Slim then.  I'd like to interview Afro Man.  Do you like them?  I don't know if we'll see Afro Man.  How about Christopher Walken?  Christopher Walken.  Christopher Walken.  He's an actor, isn't he?  He's an actor.  Yes.  Yeah, he's in the Fat Boy Slim video that's up for an award, a few awards.  And what would you say to Christopher Walken?  What would you say to Chris Walken?  What would you say to him?  I know he's an actor.  I don't even go to movies.  Did you ever see...  Did you ever see...  I wanted to see the Deep Blue Sea?  That was a year ago.  He was in that.  He was in that.  He was in that.  So ask him about Deep Blue Sea. 
[00:23:00]  That's the last movie I went to go see.  That was the last movie you went to?  Oh, my God.  You know why?  Because there's not an issue I want to see.  You know Destiny's Child?  Yeah, we heard of that before.  And what would you say to them?  Call them in vogue.  We would have to be in the situation.  You know what?  We don't listen to music.  All right.  You're depending on the energy and the heat of the moment to kind of get your creative,  dare I say, juices flowing.  Exactly.  God, why did that all of a sudden get juices flowing in my gullet? 
[00:23:30]  Off the air.  Off the air.  I'm on vacation right now.  All right.  There you go.  I'm going to Florida on Monday.  All right.  Please tell the artist that.  Tell the artist that you're on vacation and you're going to Florida.  You're going to Florida.  Ask them about their vacation.  You know something?  Let me tell you something.  I am.  Like a fat Regal Rizzo.  You're going to walk out with your husband and they're going to think he's stealing part  of the attraction.  No. 
[00:24:00]  No.  Now, let me tell you something.  Anthony, how was your vacation?  I had a great vacation.  Well, you went to Disney World.  Yes.  And I also went to it.  Right.  And let me tell you something.  This is about the VMAs.  When you guys are out there, ask them things that maybe they're not going to be asked during  the whole red carpet walk, things about maybe their vacation, things about a family.  Things that I would usually ask you guys.  Exactly.  Hey, you know what?  I have an idea.  I'll ask them.  They're listening to you guys. 
[00:24:30]  There you go.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Why not?  Are you guys syndicated in Florida yet?  Let's look at some of the nominees for Best Rock Video and see if you know any of them.  Do you know Aerosmith?  Yes, we do.  All right.  What would you ask, would you have any questions for Aerosmith?  When do they come back on tour?  When do they come back on tour?  Right.  Oh, what a great question.  There you go.  How about Limp Bizkit?  Fred Durst?  Limp Bizkit.  Limp Bizkit.  Limp Bizkit.  Limp Bizkit.  I have no idea.  You have no clue?  All right.  How about Weezer? 
[00:25:00]  Who?  Weezer.  Weezer.  Ask him to borrow his hash pipe.  Yeah.  That'll be cute.  Because he's got one.  That'll be cute.  We know Brother Weez.  We heard of him.  Lincoln Park.  Brother Weez.  He's here.  How about we listen to all you guys?  Come on, guys.  Okay.  How about Stained?  Brother Weezer Stained.  You just said that in Rochester.  All right.  What's that?  Well, that's the rock category.  Maybe we should ask them about best pop video.  Okay.  The best pop video.  Maybe they know a little more about pop. 
[00:25:30]  Nick has a good idea online.  Name a couple of songs, please.  All right.  Let's go to Nick quick.  Real fast.  Nick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  What about Michael?  For Christina Aguilera, just have them ask a whole bunch of Britney Spears questions.  That would be good.  Yeah.  How was your date with Justin Timberlake?  What do you think of that new Pepsi commercial?  There you go.  That would really work.  Britney Spears just to be a mascoteer.  When they walk away, make sure you go, big fan, big fan, big fan.  He dug it.  There you go.  What about Michael Jackson?  We were on a subway.  We saw Michael Jackson fans. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, Earl.  You all right?  You okay, Earl?  Earl, what just happened to Earl?  Earl just fell down.  Dude, I hope you did get that on video, Steve.  Hey, Earl, stay out of the bushes.  Stay out of the bushes.  What happened, Earl?  He took the mini-disc player over, and I caught it.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, there you go.  Did a stop and roll.  Are you okay?  You all right?  All right.  You got to stay out of the bushes, I tell you that.  Oh, James, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, ONA?  What's going on, Norton?  Roll.  Yo, fellas, picture one of the picture watching TV, and one of these two beasts is walking up 
[00:26:30]  to, like, Eminem or something.  We don't look like beasts.  What do you look like?  Oh, you're so attracted to me.  I think he knocked her the F out.  And I think it would be the funniest goddamn thing I've ever seen before.  All right, James, thank you.  Oh, I didn't mean to do that.  I'm sorry.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Joe, yo, what's going on, ONA, Norton?  Hey.  What's going on?  I used to work over at a skating rink with Marion, and she used to sing Insane in the Membrane  all the time, because, you know, we had the music pumping through the system. 
[00:27:00]  Insane in the Membrane.  Joe, who?  Insane in the Membrane.  You like that one?  Paul Guy, can I say my last name or no?  You like that one?  If you want to, yeah.  Uh, Kish?  Joe, who?  Who's this?  Joe?  Paul Guy.  You know me.  I went to Elizabeth.  Joe Kish.  Oh, hi, Joe.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Marion.  What's going on?  Remember, come on, we used to joke around all the time.  We used to sing all the top hits.  All right, do Insane in the Membrane for us a little bit.  I don't remember.  Insane in the Membrane.  Insane in the Membrane.  Come on, Marion.  You know, I used to do all the crazy things with the skates in the skate room. 
[00:27:30]  That was a long time.  That was a long time.  Ah, memories.  Memories.  She used to get jiggy.  Marion, you know you have to ask someone, like, if Britney Spears comes by, just say,  um, I am you in Bizarro Land.  It'll scare the bejesus out.  Say, somewhere on a planet, a parallel planet far away, you are interviewing me.  Is he still on a line?  Hey, Opie, he's still on a line?  Uh, no, he's long gone.  Do you like this one? 
[00:28:00]  See?  This is kicking it old school.  We've got to get the Retard Laverne and Shirley rap.  We've got to put that together.  Oh, yeah.  Why not?  Sure.  How about Madonna?  I like her.  Now, Madonna comes walking by.  We like her.  We like Madonna.  What would you ask Madonna?  Well, like I said, we have to be in that situation.  But there's a farce thing I'd ask her.  First, the thing you've got to do to a star of Madonna's caliber, remember this, you compliment  her about her years of work. 
[00:28:30]  We used to talk about Madonna.  We used to, we know where she lives.  And by that point, when you see the blood trickling from her ears, just from you talking  to her, then you ask, hey, what's the blood trickling from your ears?  No.  Do you have anything you would ask Madonna?  Um, let me see.  Probably about her latest video.  Oh, very good.  Her dancers.  Look at her dancers.  I heard that they did flying trapezes.  You know.  Perfect.  Perfect.  All right.  We're all set.  Perfect.  Don't think about it too much. 
[00:29:00]  Ask about her kids, how her kids are doing.  Very good.  Let's go to Rich.  Rich, what's up?  Showing on, boys.  Hey.  Uh, you really want to piss somebody off.  Yeah.  When they get there, if they see Snoop Dogg and Dre, you should ask them whether or not  they're afraid that Suga's going to kill them the way he killed Tupac and Biggie.  Oh, God.  What's that?  Allegedly.  Have you ever, ever been proven, not even allegedly, totally false, you dick?  I have a joke here in Asia.  Fabio.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I want to tell these two farsight rejects that, uh, if they see Michael Jackson compliment 
[00:29:30]  him on his role in Planet of the Apes.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  And we like Michael Jackson.  We got interviewed on the way over here about him.  And the guy from E tried to interview us, but...  All right.  Well, now you guys are going to be doing it.  Anthony, shut up.  Shut up, ladies.  Shut up.  Can't even be polite about it.  You just got to scream about it.  We don't count nobody.  Shut up.  Joe, one leg, Anthony.  Uh, questions for the, the retarded ones.  Fat Boy Slim, ask, uh, ask him which one is fat. 
[00:30:00]  Christopher Walken, uh, ask him, love, or say to him, loved you in Superman.  Uh, Bono, I heard you died in a ski accident, didn't you?  Tell Weezer he looks like Buddy Holly.  And ask Michael Jackson.  He's like Brother Weez.  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  And ask, uh, Michael Jackson where Bubbles is.  Where Bubbles is.  Okay.  Very good.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  Don't pick on Michael Jackson.  He can't help if he's different.  Hello.  Paul.  Yeah, guys, I've been trying to, what's up?  Hey. 
[00:30:30]  All right, are they on the air?  Yeah.  Oh, this is the guy from the VMAs.  Yeah.  All right, uh, well, Carson Bailey, he went inside, I think, to put on some new, uh, blackmail  punch.  Um, there's people crowded around.  Listen, this is horrible.  Are they, first of all, is Laverne and Shirley really coming down here?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, we are.  We'll be here, we are.  Because, you know, seriously, if you guys, like, answer with those questions, you're going  to get killed.  Like, I gotta help, can I help you out?  Sure.  Help us out.  See, no one will kill them.  They'll just think they're retarded.  That's all. 
[00:31:00]  You're nuts.  You're a little nuts.  Hold on a second.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, hurry, Paul, because we gotta go.  The first thing that I would ask Pete Diddy is, what was it like to be in Jennifer Lopez?  Seriously.  No.  You don't know.  Can I go over by WNEW when this is over?  Because this is so boring.  Can I help them out, please?  I would go over there now because there's going to be a little crowd around the table there.  Yeah.  All right?  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you.  This sucks.  I would head over there now.  I can?  Yeah.  And no, no?  I guess.  Can I meet up with Laverne Shirley when I get here? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Paul, we got to go.  We got to go, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Check in with me.  Thank you.  You'll know us.  You'll know us as soon as you see us.  What did he say?  You don't ask Pete Diddy about Jennifer Lopez.  Why not?  It's public knowledge.  Sean, everyone needs to know the answer to that.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  I think Laverne Shirley should tell Weezer how much they enjoyed being in the hash pipe video.  The what video?  We don't smoke.  So we don't smoke hash.  We don't smoke pot.  We don't smoke cigarettes.  You've got to tell them that. 
[00:32:00]  You've got to tell them that.  All right.  We will.  Very good.  Okay.  We should get out of here.  We're just nuts.  We're going to do the rest of the show from the red carpet at the VMAs with our two dates.  Oh.  Marriott and Lace.  Marriott and Lace Dye.  All right.  Yeah.  Rocking with the retards today on the O&A show at the VMAs.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  We're fat.  We're ugly.  We won't shut up and we're nauseating.  We're so annoying, no one can take it.  When we look in the mirror, we break it. 
[00:32:30]  We'll give you nightmares all day long.  Like a couple of peoples.  Not a bounce of sex appeals.  Make sense for us.  The constable, a warthog, and Godzilla in leather pants.  Yes, we're both retarded, retarded.  Yes, we were born that way.  Yes, we're both retarded, retarded.  They can't get her gay. 
[00:33:00]  Yes, we won't go away.  Opie and Anthony.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Honduras.  F-ing Honduras.  The Opie and Anthony show.  And we are live at the Opie and Anthony show.  Outside the VMAs.  Now we're taking a quick walk from 57th to 7th up here.  So where are we?  62nd in Columbus? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Right?  And a quick walk.  Yes.  But a painful one for retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Bitching the whole way.  Just bitching.  Actually, Opie suggested exercise.  Look into it.  Because they're like, you're walking too fast.  Slow down.  We literally got here about a minute ago.  Right.  A minute ago.  We knew we had enough time just about to get here.  And they're bitching. 
[00:34:00]  Slow down.  Slow down.  I can't tell you.  And then Lady Di goes, oh, I used to walk.  I used to walk to stay in shape.  I go, how many day in a row?  You know, I've got to give Lady Di credit, though.  She was keeping up with the pack.  That's right.  Marianne was having a real problem where she had to stop and rest and do that thing where  then you have to sprint to catch up to the back of the crowd.  Yes, she would run.  Back to the crowd.  It was like watching two dry sea otters try to truck down 57th Street. 
[00:34:30]  It was frightening because we were looking, you know, the streets of New York full of  very attractive women, especially with the VMAs in town.  You're seeing a lot of hot girls.  And you'd look at them as they pass you by and take the turn, give the look, and then  your eyes would lock on the horror that is the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  You're like, ah, just ruins everything.  And they've ruined our image, man.  We're trying to, like, make some eye contact with some of these hot, you know, broads walking  by.  And they're looking at us and seeing that we are already taking. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, we're taking.  We're double dating with the retarded Laverne and Shirley today.  We brought them to the VMAs.  It was embarrassing because as we're walking over here, a couple of people, you know, came  up and said, hey, ONA, how you doing?  And then they look at the retarded Laverne and Shirley, they're like, you're stuck with  that old thing.  That's all right.  What a mess.  Why don't we see how they're doing?  Marion, you finally caught your breath.  I'm doing okay.  I'm doing very good, Opie.  Why?  It's not easy walking in shoes, you know?  Is that your excuse?  Yes.  Walking in shoes. 
[00:35:30]  Yes, it's not easy walking in shoes.  I don't wear shoes all the time.  People walk in shoes.  Opie, cavemen don't.  I wear sneakers all the time.  That pretty much explained it.  They're not from Kmart.  They're from Payless.  I said cavemen.  Wow.  You know what?  You don't use shoes.  You know what?  I got an observation because we usually see these two in the dull lights that is our  studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  In the bright sunlight.  Oh, my God.  Look at the color of Mary's feet.  How do we look?  We look good, don't we?  That's wonderful.  Oh, my God.  No, this is good.  The big yellow one's the molar.  We look good, don't we, guys? 
[00:36:00]  This is exactly what we want, though.  Yeah.  We're right in front of the red carpet.  Yeah.  I guess they're doing TRL right now.  That's about 20 feet away from us, right over there.  Where they're actually whooping it up and telling the people to act excited.  Is it hard to walk in shoes being the only mammal with flippers?  I don't know.  You tell me.  You're a mammal.  Oh, my God.  You're a mammal.  You got shoes on.  You got them there, man.  We got three hours of this.  You're a full nightmare.  I love you, too, Jim.  All right.  How's Lady Di doing? 
[00:36:30]  I'm fine.  Yeah.  How are you doing?  I'm fine.  You were really, you're like, I'm breathing heavy walking.  No, I was not.  Yes, you said, I'm breathing heavy.  No, no, no.  And you had a hard time walking the two blocks.  No, I said, I used to jog.  Okay, so that helped me out.  And I was able to keep up.  You used to jog away from town folk with pitchfork and torches.  That's what you were jogging.  And you were with me, Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, it's sad.  We just abuse them so bad, and they're huge fans of the show.  That's right.  Lady Di has wow bling bling on.  That's right.  No, that's not bling bling.  As old Dirty said, that is the cheapest crap. 
[00:37:00]  It is not.  That's like the stuff crackhead steel to try to get some little vinyl.  It's tin foil.  It's tin foil.  You could get the same, if you want a little impression of how thick the metal is, get a  ring ding, right?  And then unwrap the foil that's around the, don't even try to tell me you don't know what  a ring ding is.  And take the foil off of the ring ding, the hostess ring ding, that foil thicker than the  bling bling.  No, this is nice.  I like this.  One of them says ONA. 
[00:37:30]  A wopper thin medallion.  One of them says, okay, terrific.  And the other one says, wow.  Wow, all right.  People say wow when they see it.  And a big Yankee fan I see, too.  That's what it says.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  One of them says, Yankees, Anthony.  Yeah.  One of them says, Yankees.  Very good.  And the other two are Catholic charms.  Please, one of these cameras, the lights fall on my head.  Please, please.  I'm begging you.  Well, they're getting the crowd going for TRL.  It's so funny that they whoop it up for TRL for about five seconds, and then everyone  stands around looking bored until they tell them to whoop it up again.  And then they whoop it up. 
[00:38:00]  All very attractive people in front of TRL.  This is not the ordinary people they allow in.  This is like hand-picked attractive people.  The other thing, we had an escort over here, our buddy Keith, the cop.  Yeah.  I want to know what he's carrying that allowed us to, like, part the Red Sea like we just  did.  Ixnag.  Ixnag.  He's privileged.  I know, because that would have been a hassle.  We were told, you know, you can't cross here.  You've got to walk around.  Right.  And I don't know.  He showed something.  And all of a sudden, we're, hey, take over.  Take the cop car if you need it. 
[00:38:30]  Take the cruiser.  All right.  We should take a break.  We got here.  We got to settle in and see what the hell is going on.  But basically, nothing is going on right now.  They're taping TRL outside the VMAs.  And we got the retarded Laverne Shirley.  They're going to do some of the interviews with us.  But, Opie, soon, this carpet, we will be seeing the huge stars of music, Hollywood.  And they will be harassed by our own retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Look at that.  They're putting their makeup on. 
[00:39:00]  This is classic.  Putting our makeup on.  They're putting their makeup on.  Look at her.  Ask her what she's doing.  What are you putting on?  What are you putting on?  They want to look good for TV.  Lipstick.  You're putting lipstick on?  Yeah.  And what are you putting on?  You're putting on a little blush or something?  What is that?  I don't know.  A little pout of your nose.  That's good.  We got to look good.  That's okay.  Let me see your lipstick, Marion.  Let me see that.  Yeah.  Lipstick.  It's bubble gum.  Is that bubble gum pink?  You might want to do 3,500 sit-ups real quick.  Jim Norton here, of course, too. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Jim Norton, you might want to do 40 sit-ups.  Oh.  She is the worst at the comeback.  It's a horror.  It's embarrassing.  Why are all the cops kind of like getting closer to us?  Yes, there are.  Did we do anything wrong?  Big fans of the show.  What is this?  Methuselah woman cop.  My God.  She kicked the Indians out after the deal.  That lady would kick your ass.  Does the little one have a gun?  Does the little one have a gun?  Of course.  They all have guns. 
[00:40:00]  All right.  Let's take a break, Anne.  Huh?  Yes.  Live from the Video Music Awards.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Live from the red carpet.  Ah!  What a yacht!  It's Opie and Anthony from the 2001 NTV Video Music Awards at Lincoln Center in New York City.  Oh, no!  Oh, no, no, no!  Ah.  Oh, to go.  Yes, Anthony.  Oh, to go.  Oh, it's oxygenated, distilled drinking water.  Real purity.  Great taste.  No aftertaste either.  Distilled water.  Very healthy.  And you know something? 
[00:40:30]  Oxygenated, distilled water.  Healthy.  And it tastes good.  It's not like eight times the oxygen of normal water.  Oh, to go.  Set the purity standard against which all other waters will be measured.  I'm going to have some.  I'm going to have some Oh, to go right now.  Look for Oh, to go and original blue.  Delicious, calorie-free, essence, flavors.  There we go.  I can taste the oxygen.  If there was a spark here, my head would explode.  So much oxygen in it.  The coffee replacement. 
[00:41:00]  Want to perk up without the caffeine?  Here it is, guys.  It's Oh, to go.  Mmm.  Oh, to go.  And you're checking out the Opie and Anthony still.  We are outside the VMA, Dan.  Not much going on yet.  They're still taping TRL.  Carson Daly has made its way outdoors.  We just walked out.  People are, I think that's called crimping him.  Yeah.  He was being crimped by some of the staff.  His hair, they had a little comb and a brush. 
[00:41:30]  They crimped him.  Why don't we have trippers?  Not enough trippers in the world.  Yeah, they need a lot of primpers.  Right.  And he's going over his cue cards.  Yeah, the cue cards being taken care of.  All the attractive people now being moved back up front to go woo.  The professional woo people that just go woo.  Where did they get all these attractive people, by the way?  I think they auditioned them.  Because look at the fine Asian lady next to the fine mocha princess over there. 
[00:42:00]  I see that.  And the girl that looks like one of the Spice Girls in between.  She looks like Sporty Spice.  Of course, Sporty Spice gave up on the sporty.  We saw her recently.  Oh, my God.  She's Edie Spice now.  Yeah.  And they only go with the hot chicks, too.  Where there was like a bunch of burn victims outside yelling,  We can cheer.  We can cheer.  Yeah, they can cheer louder.  But look at this one.  Look at the one in the leopard.  Ah, yes.  Do you see that?  What the hell's going on there?  Like she was just wandering the streets and they dragged her in for TRL.  Now, are they hoping to get discovered by doing this gig?  Yeah.  It's either this or sucking stuff. 
[00:42:30]  Or does Fred Durst walk out and decide which one he wants to bang tonight?  Whoever catches the goo gets to move on to the next category.  You know how pathetic we are, Anthony?  Yeah.  There are hot women everywhere.  I mean, everywhere.  Everywhere you look, except here.  We have the retarded Laverne and Shirley behind us who put on makeup.  They're primping with a jackhammer.  Yeah.  And that's what we have here.  Carson's reading the cue cards now. 
[00:43:00]  I wish I could see them.  I'd read along.  Look at the abs on that girl.  Black girl.  Yeah, see that?  Oof.  God damn.  Damn.  They're not real people here.  This isn't like the real people.  They're outside.  You see way to the left over here, the bleachers that are over there?  Those are the real people.  Way far away.  Way across the street.  This is like everything's beautiful at MTV.  And if I could quote someone that was on our show about six months ago?  Yeah.  This is not what I'm used to.  I don't know how to act in front of beautiful people. 
[00:43:30]  They are truly the beautiful people.  But we're also waiting for the limos to pull up, because I don't think anybody's really gotten  here yet.  And we have the retarded Laverne and Shirley, who will be conducting the interviews.  Hello.  Well, let's talk to them, because they took care of their makeup.  They're all dollied up.  You guys all dolled up.  All dolled up.  All gussied up, like they say.  We attracted young ladies.  Dollied up.  And are you ready?  Yeah.  Yes, we are.  Hey, can I ask you something?  Sure.  You guys spend a lot of time in front of the mirrors and stuff, you know, primping. 
[00:44:00]  What did you do?  We put makeup on.  You did?  Yeah, why?  We put our makeup on.  Would you consider a ski mask?  Would you?  Look at the pancake on Marion.  She put the pancake makeup on.  Yeah, I know.  And it's like when Wilma Flintstone went to the beauty parlor, Wilma and Betty, and  they go in and they walk out and look exactly the same.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Wilma still has the same doorknob on her head hairdo, and that's exactly what they 
[00:44:30]  did.  They did all kinds of work.  They've been working on themselves now since we took a break, and they look exactly the  same.  People are screaming, and there's no one here.  Nothing's going on.  They're screaming for Carson Daly.  Ladies, are you psyched?  Are you ready to do this?  Yeah, we are.  They are screaming at Carson Daly, Diane.  That's what they're screaming at.  Do you like Carson Daly?  What do you think of Carson?  He's all right.  He's good.  Do you think he's cute?  Yeah.  He's cute.  He was engaged one time to Tyree.  Oh.  Oh, very good.  Wow. 
[00:45:00]  You're pretty knowledgeable about Carson.  Why don't you ask him about Tyree and see what happens?  Yeah.  They split up.  They split up, and they hate each other.  Ladies, so you're going to be standing in front of this table here, okay?  No problem.  And you see the red carpet?  Yeah, we see.  And you're going to lean over, and you're going to ask your questions, okay?  Yeah.  What do you want us to ask them?  No, see, that's where you come in.  That's why this works perfectly.  Well, yes, we'll do the best we can.  Okay.  That's what we're going to do, the best we can. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  Very good.  Do you know Carson has a sidekick now for TRL?  Well, it's this little chick that won a contest, and I think it wasn't like one of those fake  Rocco-type contests.  It was like a real deal.  She came in, and all of a sudden, she was so good, they decided to keep her, and she's  not too shabby.  She kind of looks like Mandy Moore, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  She got the look at the time.  I don't know.  They all look the same.  Yeah.  That look.  But, yeah, she's definitely hot.  Got the curling hair in her cars. 
[00:46:00]  I bet Carson starts banging her eventually.  Now that it doesn't have the Tara Reid thing, what do you think?  I didn't think she got the job.  Oh!  Where's Fred Durst?  He's next.  Norton, any comments?  You ran away already from us.  I had to tangle, and my friend works for MTV, and she walked by.  Nice!  That's not a real...  That's not just a person on the street.  That isn't just a person that walked in on the street.  I would give anything to be a ladies' room toilet. 
[00:46:30]  Did you see anything inside?  You'd be the one that retarded the brain surely used, but you're all like, ugh, disgusting.  Did you see anything inside?  No, there's nothing in there.  It's nothing going on here?  Yeah, nothing.  It's just hot and disgusting.  Yeah, how did you get inside?  My friend works for MTV, so she walked me down.  Oh, really?  And I have my badge.  I thought you looked a little friendly with her.  Yeah, yeah.  I was like, why is Norton accosting some of the MTV staff?  Another one that won't sleep with me.  Oh, your friends are there.  Okay.  Well, something tells me once you sleep with them, they're not your friends. 
[00:47:00]  Not at all.  They're very disappointed.  They're filing charges, restraining orders, all kinds of fun stuff.  That's kind of rough.  That was only 30 seconds, and I'm positive, Mel?  I've got to tell you, Carson Daly has the easiest gig in entertainment.  Yeah.  Easier than our gig.  He comes out, he reads off cue cards for 10 seconds, and then rests.  And he doesn't even have to make it look like he's not reading cue cards because he's wearing  the sunglasses.  He could read right off of them.  He's got now the chick next to him.  He's got an earpiece just in case he can't read the cue cards. 
[00:47:30]  It's amazing.  It's funny.  It's like Brando and Dr. Moreau.  They're just feeding his lines.  What a job.  All right.  Well, yeah, we got...  There's no one else to really talk to.  We got to wait.  I know.  I think MTV's a little scared of us, too, because we have a lot of people around us  kind of making sure we behave.  They said, if anyone gets on the red carpet, if we step on the red carpet, we're all out  of here.  All thrown out.  Plug pulled.  Never come back again.  But she said it with a smile. 
[00:48:00]  Like, they have to say that.  But she wants you to know that if you step out there, you're gone.  But she said it with a smile.  She wants you to know that she means business, so...  But we're not going to do that, anyway.  We're right on the rail.  We're just now waiting for some of these schlumps to arrive, so...  Hey, Lady Diane Marion, could you, like, bend down out of sight for a while?  No.  Why?  Why?  Well, there's a lot of hot girls walking by, and, you know...  Okay.  What would they have to do with us?  Go look. 
[00:48:30]  Go chase.  What do you guys think of the hot ladies in the TRL audience?  They look good.  Why not?  Do you see one ugly one out there?  They're probably under 25.  They all think we brought our moms with us.  Hey, do you have a friend who looks like your mother?  They're not.  Yeah, we are being scrutinized.  Do you see the people that walk by every two seconds?  And they go, ugh.  And they just look like security people.  Like, look at this guy.  Maybe they're just wondering what we're doing.  He's talking.  Look at it.  Now he's having a conference with the guy with the gray hair. 
[00:49:00]  I think they think we're just going to jump over the rails and go,  doo, doo, doo, doo, in people's faces.  Hey, who's the fat guy with the Z100 microphone?  That's the guy that's on.  Yeah.  Well, we're on.  Opposite us in New York.  We don't even know his name.  I swear to God.  I have no clue.  We've been competing against him for, what, three years or something?  Yeah.  I'm sure he's putting on quite a show over there.  Well, he's waiting for the, you know, the nonstop music to end so he can talk for 10 seconds. 
[00:49:30]  You know, they have an awful long way to walk here.  We're at the end of the red carpet right before they go inside.  And I'm looking at this, how far, they go around this big fountain, they come out in front on the street.  By the time they get here, they're not going to want to talk to anybody, I bet.  I think all the TV press is down that way, right?  Where the limos arrive?  Yeah, you would think they're right where the limos let them off.  So by the time they get here, they think it's all over.  They're not going to stop for anything. 
[00:50:00]  You watch this.  Which way are they coming from?  They're coming from over there.  There's going to be nobody to bother them right there except cheering people, so they'll probably want to stop and chat.  No, I think all the TV media, like E! and stuff, are in here.  They're going to be right next to us?  Right next to us.  All right, that could be cool.  I would think they would be right where the limo drops them off.  Oh, I see lots of camera people coming.  Oh, maybe some of the TV people have shown up.  We could talk to them for a little while.  That'll make for interesting radio.  That'll eat up time until some effing celebrities show up. 
[00:50:30]  And they're screaming more for what?  Carson.  That's right.  It's so big.  You know what?  I've seen that guy, the bald guy right there.  Yeah.  That's one of P. Diddy's people.  Which one?  When the whole trial was going down?  Yeah.  I always saw that guy behind P. Diddy.  Oh, yeah?  And he's looking around, looking around, making sure the area's secure.  I think P. Diddy's coming out soon, Anthony.  The white guy?  The white guy that's, yes, has like a five head. 
[00:51:00]  What a ghoul he looks like.  He would kick your ass.  Oh, look at Carson's kissing.  He kissed his little sidekick girl.  Very nice.  And now Carson's going inside.  He's done.  He did his three minutes.  God damn, what a job.  Jeremy, how do we get that gig?  I want that job.  We're kidding.  We want that gig.  No kidding.  We're sitting here pulling this out of our butts.  He reads off cue cards for three minutes.  He's back inside banging a bra.  You need beautiful people around you.  All the girls now wearing the hip huggers.  Right.  Why didn't we have retarded Laverna show? 
[00:51:30]  Girls, why didn't you wear some hip huggers?  You notice all the girls are wearing hip huggers now?  Hip huggers?  Real low.  Yeah.  Down on the hips.  What do you say?  This is what I had.  This is what I had in my closet.  I just have a hip huggers pair of Carhartt hip huggers.  You know, it's the style.  This is what we wear.  This is what we wear.  This is us.  Yeah, we see that.  Hip huggers that have to be installed with a pneumatic tire hammer.  That's what you guys wear.  That's what you guys wear.  That's what you guys wear.  Hey, ladies, do you have any observations? 
[00:52:00]  You've been hanging out here for about 20 minutes now.  What do you think about looking interesting?  It's very good, but what are they all yelling about?  They're all yelling at Carson Daly.  He's the only one.  What's wrong with that?  They're taping a TV show.  I'm saying that there's not wrong with that.  Right.  That's your only observation, that people are yelling for Carson Daly?  Yeah.  You pick up on every nuance, don't you?  Why?  That's why.  Ladies, I'm going to slow down there, Joe.  Any observations?  Any observations?  No, I just think it's very interesting to be here. 
[00:52:30]  I love it.  I think it's great.  Are you hungry?  No, I'm not hungry.  I'm fine.  I'm not hard to believe.  We could get some catering for you if you like.  You know, soon, though, when the celebrities come by and the retarded Laverne and Shirley  start, what they are here for, the interviewing, I can't wait to see it.  I think there's just going to be horrified people when they look at them and think, oh,  my God, the circus came to town and no one told us.  I think we're going to be so embarrassed we're going to be under this table.  I know.  That's what I don't.  I don't really want to be seen when these people come by and have to look at the retarded 
[00:53:00]  Laverne and Shirley.  It's going to be like looking at it like a car wreck.  Oh, no, I can't.  I can't look.  Oh, I got to.  No, I can't.  I got it.  And if we don't get them food, one of them will be chewing their own foot off in the corner  or the other one asks stupid questions.  And I certainly hope they make it onto TV somehow.  Ben, what's going on back there?  They just don't shut up.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Shut up.  She was talking about her camera.  They can't shut up.  Yeah.  We forgot the camera.  It's in the bag in the studio.  Go get it.  I also want to thank you two for letting me ride on the elevator down in a little bit of a walk, 
[00:53:30]  I have to tell you, with these two mutants.  We ran out of the place.  You love this, Ben.  We ran out of there so fast when we left the studio.  We're like, what about the retard of the Vernon Shirley?  Screw it.  Hit lobby.  Hit lobby.  Yeah.  Let Ben deal with her.  All I heard in the distance was, hey, aren't we supposed to be going with you guys?  Clunk of the door shutting.  Clunk.  All right.  We should take a break and regroup, I guess, huh?  Hey, when does the action really start?  Around five?  Yeah, when the hell do people start showing up?  Jeremy, seriously, that's what they've been telling people?  They lock down this whole area at five, and that's when things start. 
[00:54:00]  And then by 5.30 is when things probably start getting pretty good.  You'll probably have the lamer people come in first.  Oh, so I don't care.  We don't care.  We just need someone to talk to.  I want somebody to come in.  I'm tired of just looking at people yelling at Carson and his primpers.  There's a crowd gathering over there near the stage.  When are the live acts going to start playing?  They start right before the live show.  So that's on in the, you know, like in the seven o'clock hour, I think so.  Do we know who's playing out here?  Alien Ant Farm, Wyclef, some of the rappers.  Some 41?  No, it's Alien Ant Farm. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, okay.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Cool.  We're outside the VMAs.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's O.B. and Anthony, live.  What'd you just say?  Live from the red carpet at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards at Lincoln Center in New York City.  Ah, that's our buddy Frank Caliendo.  Yeah.  We've got to get him back on the show very, very soon, right?  Absolutely.  We are outside the VMA Awards.  And it does look like things are getting a little more hectic. 
[00:55:00]  You're feeling the energy.  It's like building, right?  Yeah, yeah.  World Camera Cruise is showing up.  They're setting up stages.  They're getting more strict with people.  They're moving the hot chicks around to get better angles of them for their MTV shows.  They've got a scam going on at MTV.  I don't know what it was all about.  We just watched this one MTV, like tech.  Some guy would have passed on a little clipboard or something.  Grabbed some girl from one of the crowd areas of normal people. 
[00:55:30]  And she was like a cyborg hot chick.  Like it couldn't possibly have just happened naturally.  Yeah.  Like it had to be cyborg hot.  Right up front.  And, yeah, they parade her in front of everybody like they were taking her somewhere.  Yeah.  But they weren't taking her somewhere.  They're just parading her around to get people's hormones up, I guess.  And did you see the beast they just dragged in there now?  No.  No.  Oh, she looks like Mabel King with legs. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, God damn.  Are you talking about Lady Di or somebody else?  I know.  You know why?  Whenever you say these, it doesn't matter what goes out there.  They could parade a goddamn hippopotamus down this and it would be like, that's more attractive to look at.  So they parade this girl around and everyone just stops doing what they were doing.  Everyone dropped everything.  Unbelievable.  She had the low hip hugger pants.  Hip hugger's very big.  And in the back, it went down really far, like just about at butt crack level.  And then she had a little halter top on with, of course, no bra. 
[00:56:30]  And she was defying gravity in every way.  Yeah, she was bouncing right down the red carpet right in front of us.  The interesting thing, that guy's job is to find the hot chicks in the crowds.  For Carson and Fred Durst?  Or is it for TRL?  But, Anthony, the question I got for you, how does he know which one is hotter?  I mean, they're all hot, but he's like, no, the girls aren't hot enough.  I've got to get the girl from over here and put her over there.  They know.  They know.  I want to talk to that guy because it's his whole job to check out the crowd and get the hot girls in place. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, that's someone I want to interview.  The guy that was just parading around the hot chick.  Did they get her up front?  Oh, that's her right there, right?  Yeah, she's right in front now.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you're watching it at home.  You'll know when you see her.  In the pink, right?  She's wearing a pink top.  I wouldn't.  Yeah, pinkish red.  Pinkish peach.  Pinkish peach.  I think I'm colorblind.  Who cares what color it is?  She's colorblind.  So they can see her.  They'll know which one to look for.  Yeah, you'll notice her.  Believe me.  We're pathetic as guys, though, because we're in the middle of commercials and we're trying to set up our next break here. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  You know, because this is a really important broadcast for the Opie and Anthony show because we've been invited to something finally.  And we're doing a little powwow and all of a sudden we all see the girl and we just forgot what we were talking about.  Stop talking.  So let's go.  And then it up to the bar for all the other chicks because the girls that had previously walked by that were the hottest chicks, they lost their title.  So everyone wasn't even paying attention to that.  And like five minutes earlier, it was like, oh, my God, look at that. 
[00:58:00]  And all these hot girls, they're very competitive because now they see that, you know, you get someone's attention, they're going to give you a nice shot, you know, shot on TV.  So now all the other girls are trying to look hotter.  Yeah.  They're fixing their makeup and they're pulling their pants down a little bit.  Look at those two there doing the double dung dildo act just to try to get on TRL.  I think it'll work.  I think that might work.  Amazing.  Hey, who's that guy?  There's a guy that's standing there right in front of me.  Oh, hi.  Who's that?  I don't know.  Hey, guy.  He looks important.  He's got a cell phone. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, I've seen that guy on Behind the Video Music Awards.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Why does he have the dog that goes for me to poop on?  He's one of the...  He's got a puppet of the poop on dog.  He's one of the MTV guys, so...  Yeah.  He looks like Richard Speck's roommate when he was in jail.  When he was given the interview with his new boobs.  That's funny.  All right.  Yes, eagerly awaiting the arrival of any celebrity.  So, of course, our wonderful... 
[00:59:00]  I almost said lovely, shoot me.  Our wonderful Laverne and Shirley, retarded Laverne and Shirley, can start the interviewing.  Yeah, they're kind of conversing with some hot chicks.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  Ladies, how are you doing?  Good.  Very good.  I noticed you've found some hot chicks to talk to.  Yeah, we're talking to people.  Are you?  Are you making friends?  Yeah.  We always make friends where we go.  Oh, God.  Imagine that voice just starts...  We make a lot of friends.  That's right.  Yeah?  Good.  What kind of conversation were you having with the hot chicks? 
[00:59:30]  There was a guy back there from Arizona.  We were wondering who you guys were.  So we were telling them who you were.  What did you say to the guy from Arizona?  We were.  What did you say to him?  We told him you were all being Anthony from N.E.W., your number one, your radio.  You're syndicated all over the place.  You couldn't pick any place further than Arizona?  Was that the first place that popped in his head?  Of course the country, right?  We wanted to know if these guys were syndicated in Arizona.  I told him to ask this.  Where you're from?  Where you're from?  Where's the furthest place on the globe?  That's what I'm saying I'm from.  So you're getting excited, all psyched for this? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, we are.  We're trying to figure out why they're only yelling for Carson Daly, though.  There's a rumor going around that you two were killed for their cheering.  What?  Hey, Jim.  That's all that's happening now.  But I see big crowds starting to gather where the limos drop off the big celebrities.  It should be starting any minute now.  I sure hope so.  Ladies, are you hoping you're going to be picked for a crowd scene?  What? 
[01:00:30]  They're walking around looking for hot ladies so they can put them up in front for a good camera shot.  The TRL.  Are you hoping to be picked?  Not really.  Do you know they do that?  They pick the really pretty girls and they put them on the front of the line.  No, they don't.  So when the cameras go by, it looks like everyone that listens or is involved with MTV is just beautiful.  Well, we don't listen to MTV.  I just think maybe they're not getting enough exposure.  Well, I think this is the Discovery Channel Awards.  Discovery Channel.  Yeah, they figure out how to get you discovered. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  She's on fire.  She's full of them.  She's on fire.  Love you too, Jim.  The insult comic.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey, Mary, when are you going to put down your big pocketbook?  Yeah, what are you doing?  No one's going to steal it.  What do you got in there anyway?  Nothing.  Can we look through your pocketbook?  Can we look through your pocketbook?  What do you have in there besides not stopping her too?  Get her pocketbook before she says no.  Put my cell phone.  All right, go through it.  Let's see what's in Marion's. 
[01:01:30]  Not in there.  My cell phone and makeup.  Makeup.  Get that out of my wallet.  Get out of my pocketbook.  I see a Subway sandwich.  Very good.  Yeah, a Subway sandwich.  What is that?  What is this?  It's a pad.  No, I'll keep it.  You didn't use that.  Who's time of the month is it?  Who's time?  Who's having their time?  No.  Who's having their time?  Hold that up.  Who's having their time of the month?  Who's time is it?  That carpet was white until she ran over it. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, somebody.  Marion, what kind of pad do they?  I've never seen this type of pad.  Oh, my God.  What kind of pad is this lady dying?  Marion, what kind of pad is this?  Well, well.  The celebrities aren't the only people that will be walking the red carpet this evening.  I think lady, Marion.  What kind do you use?  Is that a Kotex mini pad?  What is that?  It looks like one of those inflatable mattresses you go camping with.  Do you need it?  Do you need it?  No.  Can we open it?  Open it up.  No.  It's like a pillow they give you on the airlines. 
[01:02:30]  Open it up.  Open it up.  Let's check the absorbency.  All right.  Marion, that's an emergency.  Marion, seriously.  Because now it's out in the open, okay?  Is it your time of the month?  Guys, open my, leave my pocketbook alone.  You don't use tampons?  Like our girls now use tampons.  No, you get toxic shock syndrome from tampons.  Oh, that was a mouthful.  You get what?  Ask your girlfriend what you can get from tampons.  What do you get?  What do you get?  None of your business. 
[01:03:00]  When you go to put one in, does it shrivel up and run away?  That wasn't the problem.  I think she said...  No, no, Marion.  Don't go anywhere.  Marion, what do you get?  Toxic shock syndrome?  What do you get?  If you use what?  Tampons?  No, it's not.  You get what?  None of your business.  No, you're going to educate us.  Get out of my pocketbook, please.  You're going to help people.  I'm not into it anymore.  Get out of my pocketbook.  Bang.  Bang, you're holding that like the drill sergeant in full metal jacket with a donut?  Yeah.  Give her back her pocketbook. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  But this is used now, so let me put this back pocketbook.  Open that up.  I want to know more about toxic shock syndrome.  Is that what it was?  No, it's toxic sock.  Can you get that?  Oh, my God.  Chris Robinson's girlfriend just walked by.  Just kidding.  I was going to say, you've got a white ass.  That better not be her.  Are you mine?  That thing isn't mine.  What?  It's open and stuff.  It's used.  You can't use it now.  It's not sterilized.  Right.  Does that actually hold a three-pound clot? 
[01:04:00]  You know what that thing is doing right now?  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  You've saved me.  All right.  Oh, my God.  You know, it happens after you got surgery.  Oh, is that what it is?  Oh, okay.  But is it your time of the month?  No.  Is that?  Oh, okay.  Well, give her back.  Give Marion back her pad.  Opie.  Opie.  Come on.  No, no.  I will never, ever, ever come up to the studio again.  Oh, now I have to throw it. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, Lady Di, get away.  What are you doing?  She's trying to reach over the table and grab Marion's pad.  It's just a pad.  Don't give it to her.  Let the inside of her pants look like a Quincy episode.  Marion, why are you getting upset?  Opie.  You said we could go into your pocketbook.  No, I did not.  And we found this little ditty.  We don't even know the name of this.  What's the name of it?  It's a pad.  What is it?  What brand do you use?  Oh, it's a Kotex.  It's a Kotex. 
[01:05:00]  It is a Kotex.  It's a brownstone.  Everybody here, Rick.  No, what brand is that?  Rick, you have a dump button.  Hold.  Hold the button.  I hope someone can dump that back at the ranch.  I want to make sure you're okay, Marion.  Give Marion the mic.  Look at her.  Look at that claw.  Marion.  Do you need the claw of a bear?  This is awful.  I don't eat Twinkies.  Marion.  Give her back her Kotex maxi pad.  All right, Marion.  I'm going to give you back the Kotex maxi pad.  Give her back her maxi pad.  Hey, let me tell you, Opie.  With the other way around, and Sandy has something like that, would you like it? 
[01:05:30]  No.  She doesn't use this.  She might get top of toxins, though, though.  You got to watch out.  Why would Sandy have that unless she was going to go tobogganing?  Look, guys, I have the same thing in my pocketbook, too, so.  Can we see yours?  Can we see yours?  Let's see yours.  Let's see yours.  You'll make Marion feel much better, Lady Di.  You'll make her feel better that you have one, too.  Get your pocket.  Lady Di, come on.  Get your pocket.  Is it true, Lady Di, that the same people that pack the parachutes for the 82nd Airborne  have to fold up your pants?  Hey, your girlfriends get that time of the month or every month. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, but they don't ride.  I know.  They don't use a blow-up mattress, though.  Air mattress.  What is that?  All right, now we're in Lady Di's box.  He's got drugs.  Oh, by the way, we're outside the VMA Awards.  Right.  And we're just going through Lady Di's variants.  This is for mental clarity.  Let me see that.  What about that?  You can't write better stuff on this.  What is that?  This is better than hanging with a carrot top.  You went into Lady Di's bag, and she's got Niken, bio-directed nutrient technology. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, what's Niken?  What's what?  It's a superior multi-action complex.  Oh, God.  And it says in big yellow letters on the front, for mental clarity.  Is that in there?  No.  Whoa.  What's the expiration date on this?  When are you going to start taking the pills?  Yeah, honey, it's...  Hey!  Now, Lady Di has Stay Free Classic.  I told you.  Every girl has that in their pocketbook.  Hey, you never know when...  You never know when...  I wanted to think of what we just saved this thing from. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my God!  Oh, you got one of these, too.  Hey, you got the same...  What's that?  A used one?  Marion, I feel like a magician.  How many of these are we going to pull out of your pocketbook?  How badly do you bleed per day?  It's like a clown car.  Oh, my God.  I mean, instead of clowns.  We're up to four.  What's going on?  At least you guys are cycling together.  That's nice.  I've heard rumors that...  Yeah, that girl's actually...  Are you guys...  Do you guys cycle at the same time?  Uh, yes, we do.  You do?  Because you're pals.  Same time.  What? 
[01:07:30]  Because you're buddies and pals and that happens.  No, not that kind of stuff.  It's depressing.  We have the hottest girls around here outside.  You never know when you might even know...  Right.  And we're looking in the purse of the elephant man.  Absolutely.  The last time I saw a pad that big, though, it was over a sucking chest wound in a World War II movie.  So I don't even know what the hell's going on.  You want to put it over her crotch and just punch and go, hang on, hang on.  Come on, you're going to make it.  That is entertainment, ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:08:00]  Holy smug.  Well, we just...  There's your...  Why do you use the classic Maxi instead of the tampon lady dye?  Now, I know why she...  Hold on.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  They're dumping out.  They're dumping out.  That's what it is.  We're responsible broadcasters.  You can't use a tampon.  It doesn't.  It doesn't.  Wait, wait.  Okay, okay, okay.  Let's just say there's a problem with slippage.  Do you ever hear Geronimo before it falls out?  You know what it's like?  I guess... 
[01:08:30]  What?  You guys...  Wait, wait.  Keep it clean because they're dumping out.  No, you guys have girlfriends, so you know.  It's okay.  It's all right.  Yeah, that's okay.  You know what it's like?  You ever see the nails that you hang your gutters with?  The big gutter nail?  Try pulling it out, and then try hanging with a finishing nail.  You might get an image of what happens and why...  Like, the nail would just fall right out.  Wow, look at this.  They just let all the media in.  Oh, here we go.  How come we got in so early?  We got here nice and early, and they had them all, I don't know, corralled somewhere, 
[01:09:00]  and they just let them free.  Opie, don't make it sound like we got treated special.  These people had more to do than we did.  So they're coming on time.  We just didn't have anything else to do.  No, not my time.  That's true.  It got overrated.  All right.  Now they're pointing at people.  They're getting very excited, Opie.  Who am I?  Lady Diane Marion.  Who are you pointing at?  Who are you pointing at?  We're not pointing at names.  Do you see anyone?  Well, the press is all in here.  I'm seeing cameras now, camera crews, the people with the ladders and whatnot. 
[01:09:30]  Why don't we move Lady Diane Marion right up by the front of the table?  Yeah, ladies, why don't you come up here and get comfortable,  because it's where you're going to be hanging for some of the interviews.  That's okay.  That's okay.  All right?  Over here, over here.  Go this way.  It's a free-for-all.  Ladies, is it safe to say, because you are our dates for the VMAs,  that we're not going to get any action because it's your time of the month?  Oh.  This is what?  Jeez.  What?  I'm into some crime scene sex, Opie. 
[01:10:00]  Yum, yum.  Give me some.  You ever have the crime scene sex, Norton?  I know.  I'm very sure.  No, we don't.  No?  You're not into crime scene sex?  No.  No.  Where you're having that time and the bed looks like it should be roped off with cop tape?  I know.  A lot of guys don't like to do that around that time of the month.  All right.  But, Marion, you're married, obviously.  Yeah, I am.  And it's supposedly your time of the month.  What do you do to satisfy your man?  You wait eight or nine days.  You don't talk?  No.  You wait eight or nine days.  I like the bedroom to look like the room that the guy sloth was killed in in the movie 
[01:10:30]  Seven.  That's the prison sex I like.  Uh-oh.  That's a turn-on when there's a Bruno Mali under your bed.  Can I ask you something?  What's eight or nine days?  It doesn't matter.  Eight or nine days.  The most women get there is a seven days.  But you guys don't do the Hummer?  How about the Hummer?  That's a good one.  Hey, girls, let me tell you.  You're our date here today, so don't be picking up the celebrities and musicians that are going  to...  Am I your date? 
[01:11:00]  No.  I'm Marion's date.  No, you're not.  No.  No, no, no.  Uh-oh.  No, I want Lady Di tonight.  Lady Di?  You want me tonight?  Yeah, baby.  Look at you.  Well...  I'm packing a salami down here, so at least I can rub it along the side.  Anyway, I want to be ready to say...  So don't fall out.  All right, ladies, you're psyched.  It's almost showtime for you.  It's almost showtime.  We're going to give you the mics.  Yeah, we're going to give you the microphones.  You girls...  I almost said, guys, why would I do that, Jim? 
[01:11:30]  You girls are going to take over and interview the celebrities, musicians.  These are people from Hollywood.  Hey, whatever.  Music, movies, television.  Anthony, you know what I'm thinking?  Let me, first of all, join you on the other side of the table.  Yes.  I'm thinking...  You're going to try to squeeze out.  I ain't going that way.  All right, hold on.  And, ladies, take this.  Good luck.  If you're standing there and someone tries to carve their initials in you, don't take it personally.  I won't.  I'm not asking you, Jim.  That's good. 
[01:12:00]  There you go.  Do you have a show to do tonight?  I mean...  Yeah.  Yes, 10 o'clock, Carol.  Okay, Anthony, I'm on the other side of the table with you.  And now the ladies are in position.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, because they just filled the media tent to our right, I think Lady Diane  Marion should introduce themselves, because they're going to be working side-by-side  with some media outlets.  Some media types?  Yeah.  Why don't we give them a microphone?  You see the ladies with the clipboards?  Just introduce yourself and see where they're from and all that, okay?  And say that you're here representing the Opie and Anthony show and, you know...  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Right, okay.  Okay?  All right, Lady Diane's got the mic.  A little practice for them.  Let's get the mic through here first.  We are tangled up really bad.  Here you go.  You just got to pull it right around.  All right.  We're giving the microphone to Lady Diane.  Now, girls, get in position.  And, Ben, you help them out, I guess.  Oh, my God.  It's like the Special Olympics of broadcasting, isn't it?  Isn't it truly?  Where everyone's a winner.  All right, here's Lady Diane.  Ladies, how you doing?  Hi, ladies.  We're Lady Diane Marion from the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you? 
[01:13:00]  Where are yous from?  Entertainment Weekly.  Oh.  From where?  From Entertainment Weekly.  Entertainment Weekly.  Okay.  And you're here to see all the artists that are going to come up over here, right?  That as well.  We're also covering the event as well.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  What were you hoping to see tonight?  I'd love to see Christopher Walken.  He's such a spook.  He's walking.  Right.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Is it always a joke?  If you just want to do a soft shoe, I'm there.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  They don't know what she's talking about.  Who else are you hoping to see?  This is harassment that is an arrestable event.  Oh, they speak.  I know.  We're a little wacko, but we're a lot of fun.  And you know what?  We're a lot of fun.  I get your magazine, and it mail every week.  And it's very weekly.  I do.  Entertainment Weekly.  I do.  I do.  To your show.  It was all B and Anthony's show.  Every now and then.  Though I'm a little afraid.  I'm a little afraid of what you guys do.  We'll be afraid of that.  We'll be afraid of that. 
[01:14:00]  We'll be okay.  Cool guys.  All right.  Ben.  Fun.  Ben, escort them back.  No, no.  I want them to introduce themselves.  Okay.  Because it's not busy yet.  There are so many freaks.  I've never seen no cameras in my life.  We'll talk over here.  Hi guys.  How are you?  Checking your duties.  I'm Cheryl.  Tiger Beat.  Tiger Beat.  Tiger Beat.  When I was a teenager.  I used to read that magazine all the time.  When you were a teenager.  When Fabian was a teenager.  David Cassidy.  Definitely David Cassidy.  This month, Caligula. 
[01:14:30]  Colors.  John Cassidy.  Parker Stevenson.  Donny Osmond.  The Monkees.  Everybody.  That's great.  Who are you hoping to see tonight?  Britney.  Ah, Britney Spears.  Okay.  And where are you from?  Seventeen.  Seventeen.  And who are you hoping to see?  NSYNC.  We've got to give him another Michael.  I'm hoping to see NSYNC, too.  And what about, like, Michael Jackson, Madonna?  Janet Jackson will be here.  But no Michael.  No?  No?  Madonna.  No? 
[01:15:00]  They're not going to be here today?  I don't mind.  She's in town.  You, too, will be here.  Michael Jackson's in town.  I'd love to see him.  He's doing a show at concerts, right?  Yeah, tomorrow night.  Right.  And these are just the other press people.  Are they not going to be here today?  Imagine the horror on the people's faces.  No, no.  Because these girls are horror.  You never know.  He may pop up.  They're horror.  You never know.  Can you imagine now a high-profile...  They're screaming for Carson Daly.  You're missing it.  Because they have to from MTV.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You missed something that was just priceless.  The girl from Seventeen is getting really, really nervous. 
[01:15:30]  They're just like, oh, God.  Oh, my God.  They're just staring at us, right?  From Premiere Magazine.  So she tries to distract their attention by going, hey, why is all that screaming going  on over there?  No, of course I do.  Of course I do.  Who doesn't listen to O.P. and Anthony?  They're wonderful guys.  They are wonderful guys.  They are wonderful guys.  So who are you guys excited to see tonight?  In Sync.  In Sync.  Backstreet Boys.  I'm here to see Backstreet Boys.  Yeah, me too.  I love them, too.  Yeah, it doesn't get better than them.  She's from Premiere Magazine. 
[01:16:00]  You know, if she comes over here, you know what's so funny?  The people...  Right.  I think we picked the perfect...  Donna Dane's...  Because the people are afraid to yell at them and say, get away from them.  Bon Jovi.  They are retarded.  Because they are indeed retarded.  Bon Jovi.  We picked the perfect people.  You can't get mad at retards.  You're right there.  You're right there.  You're right there from the radio show.  Wow.  And that's Lady Diane Marion, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  That's Jim Norton as a comedian.  This is so exciting.  Isn't it fun?  And the producer.  That's Rick, the other person.  These are going to be our correspondents to these celebrities on the red carpet. 
[01:16:30]  I love it.  We call them the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  We're going to do the best we can.  Sounds like a plan to me.  Very exciting.  Look at Marion from the back.  Her perm is growing.  What is a fun plan?  Her perm is growing out.  Yeah.  All right.  I know it is.  It is growing out.  Thank you.  Leave the reporters alone.  Yeah.  Okay.  Come back over here.  You could breathe a sigh of relief now, girls.  Thank you.  And now face this way.  That way.  Oh, this is going to work out.  Perfect.  And just get ready. 
[01:17:00]  Perfect.  Perfect.  Do we have the perfect vantage point, too?  Yes, we do.  There's no one in front of them.  No.  It's them, the carpet.  Hey, there's the guy that works for MTV.  He found another really hot chick.  And he's moving her around.  Okay.  Here's the deal.  We got Carson Daly to our left, about 25 feet.  He's taping, what?  TRL, I guess.  Or the pre-show.  Or the pre-show.  Or the pre-show.  I don't know.  Does TRL go on for hours and hours, like Wonderama used to?  I don't know what the hours are of TRL.  And we just met our fellow media.  A little bit of the media.  We met somebody from Seventeen magazine. 
[01:17:30]  Premier.  Premier.  Tiger B.  Tiger B.  And what was the first one?  Entertainment Weekly.  Not bad, huh?  And Lady Diane Marion just doing a bang-up job of interviewing some of the press.  Thank you.  We're trying.  You know.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Even though the latest Entertainment Weekly think we're a little nuts.  Well, you are nuts.  Well, Marion, you want to introduce yourself to the guy with the mohawk?  There you go.  Marion.  You are going to take a break, but a guy showed up in a mohawk.  Marion, grab the mic.  Downright frightening.  Let's see what happens here. 
[01:18:00]  Marion and Lady Di talking to the guy with the mohawk.  Hi, how are you doing?  Hi, how are you?  Hi, how are you?  Who are you?  I'm Lita from Power 86 WPOW Radio Miami.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  We're out with Lady Di.  I'm Marion.  That's Diane.  Looks like you started on the Warriors.  Lady Di.  Just walk away.  Can we ask you a couple questions?  Sure.  Who are you hoping to see here tonight?  Everybody.  I love everybody.  Is Cindy Lauper going to be here tonight?  No, she actually should be at one of the parties later.  She's not coming to the event tonight, but she'll be one of the parties.  Because she's wearing a Cindy Lauper t-shirt, by the way.  You have a picture of Cindy Lauper on your shirt.  That's why.  That's a good picture. 
[01:18:30]  That's the best voice in the world, yes.  Well, Marion, her Lady Di's voice is the most grating thing ever.  Who are you?  My name's Horace.  I'm from KMLFM in San Francisco.  Okay.  Who are you hoping to see tonight?  Honestly, I came out here with no expectations.  I just want to see everybody.  Hope to see everybody.  Hey, we're on in San Francisco.  He could be a competitor.  He probably is, sir.  I don't know when you can have done it.  No?  All right.  You have no idea who it is.  I have no idea.  Why don't we take a break, A?  Yeah, please. 
[01:19:00]  It's going nowhere now.  All right, Marion, thank you.  Drag Marion away from the radio guys.  It didn't sound like I thought he would.  No, not at all.  I thought he was like, yeah, well, I'm here to see Limp Bizkit.  Hi.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  We're outside the VMAs.  Yes, things are just really heating up now.  Definitely.  I think by the time we get back from break, Marion and Lady Di are going to be interviewing  some serious celebrities, Anthony.  Yes.  Okay.  So stay right there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:19:30]  It's Opie and Anthony live from the red carpet.  Okay, that's a little unusual.  Okay, well, tell me.  Yeah.  Broadcasting live from the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards at Lincoln Center in New York City.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  That's right, Opie.  I love Sam Adams.  You know, Jim Cook's a genius.  He had a party up at the brewery.  And a high-profile celebrity guest, Matt Damon, was there. 
[01:20:00]  You know who else?  Tara Reade.  That's right.  Carson Daly's old squeeze.  Tara Reade was there.  Shannon Elizabeth from American Pie, too.  A bunch of us celebrities up there because Jim Cook knows how to rock and Sam Adams rocks.  I love Sam Adams.  Drink it all the time.  I wish I had a keg of it here, you know, because I've never really dealt with these two sober  in my life.  And I could really use some Sam.  You know, Jim Cook uses it as a medicine.  When he crashes his bicycle, he drinks Sam Adams. 
[01:20:30]  It's a painkiller.  And it's a mind-clarity elixir.  So you should try it there, girls.  Sam Adams.  I love it.  We love it.  When I get done here, what am I going to have?  Sam Adams, because I love Sam Adams.  You will, too.  Drink it.  Sam Adams.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  And we are live outside the VMA Awards, Anthony, in the heart of New York City, right in front 
[01:21:00]  of the red carpet, man.  Yeah, look at this.  We got the sweetest spot.  I mean, all the other little fenced-off areas, packed.  Packed with other radio stations and stuff.  Radio stations, print press, news media.  Who just walked by?  Who's that?  No chicks?  It's so weird when someone famous walks by.  Everyone just turns their head real fast.  But it's not famous.  The guy with the bullhorn is directing...  All the hot chicks to go somewhere else? 
[01:21:30]  Hot chicks to walk somewhere else.  Well, how did that one get in?  Oh, Jesus.  She must have worked real hard.  If this was fishing, they would have to throw that one back in.  Like I said, we got a hot spot right here.  We've been quarantined, I think, Anthony, because all the other radio stations are to our right  and to our left.  Like you said, we got a sweet place.  All by ourselves.  We'd have had a lot more room if we didn't bring the retard of the brain.  Apparently they take up a lot.  You know what? 
[01:22:00]  I don't know how this is going over, you know, with our listeners and stuff.  But these two are just hilarious.  They really make me laugh.  They don't know they're funny, right?  I don't think so.  And they're even funnier when they're not on the radio.  I just listen to their whole conversation.  They're like, how do I look?  How do I look?  How do I look?  You look good.  What about me?  Do I look good, too?  I don't know whether you're looking great.  There's only really one awful to all of you.  All right.  We've got someone vacuuming the red carpet.  Well, you've got to vacuum it.  The likes of, um, the likes of, uh, there's going to be a lot of people. 
[01:22:30]  I really don't give a crap about walking down this red carpet.  No.  But the retard, Laverne and Shirley, I'm very excited to meet some of these people.  Have you ever seen, uh, so many cell phones in your life?  Everyone's on the phone.  Everyone has to be on the phone right now.  They're all like, uh, look at this big area.  Where the people with the video cameras from, uh, various, uh, you know, entertainment, uh,  tonight-type things, and, uh, the print media aren't there packed in.  What? 
[01:23:00]  That would suck.  Ha-ha-ha-hawk.  Oh, Alien and Farm doing a little sound check.  Yeah.  They're sound checking.  The crowd is getting huge over there.  They've got some, uh, TV lights over there, so.  Yep.  Well, that's on the MTV News, uh, sign.  Is Kurt Loder going to be in that perch?  Kurt Lode.  He's an exciting guy to listen to.  It's a thing.  Should we have Lady Diane Marion talk to some more of the, the, the media next to us?  If they make them miss somebody, they're going to be pissed. 
[01:23:30]  Well, no one's calling you.  Yeah.  All right.  They should be walking down the red carpet at any moment.  Yeah, let's, um, let's see who Lady Diane Marion could find next to us.  This is so embarrassing.  I can't, I'm cringing.  No one wants to talk to them.  No one wants to talk to them.  They're all pretending they don't notice them looking the other way.  Yeah, try to get the, the hot girl in the pink.  Oh, she has a front row spot and Rick just pulled her out of the fucking box.  God, I just lost her spot.  She just said, I heard her mouth the words, oh my God.  Hello, hi.  Where are you from?  Where am I from? 
[01:24:00]  New Jersey.  No, where, what are you doing here?  Where am I from?  I'm from Time Warner Cable.  You're from Time Warner Cable?  I'm from New Jersey too.  Yeah.  Okay.  I wanted to ask you a question.  What are, um, I'm Mary and I've done it.  Hi.  Okay.  We want to know who do you think is going to win for best video?  Best video, huh?  Yeah.  Hi.  I think, uh, Lady Marmalade.  Okay.  Oh.  We want to know, um, who do you expect to see here?  Who's Lady Marmalade?  Who do you expect to see?  Uh, well, um, hopefully, um, YouTube, Britney Spears, people like that.  Uh-huh. 
[01:24:30]  Anybody else?  Anybody else?  You're hoping.  What?  Anybody else hoping to see?  Oh, God.  Um, wow.  Fred Durst?  Oh, Fred.  Oh.  I can't take this one.  Dude, I can't take this one.  I want to ask you about your outfit.  What's that?  What?  She's asking about press about the outfits.  Who do you think is going to win for best male pop vocalist?  Thanks.  Wow.  Best female pop vocalist.  That's a tough one.  I want her to do it, Joan Rivers.  What do you wear?  What kind of categories are asking about?  Shopping for your outfit.  Back to the avenue?  Oh, a nice outfit.  Thank you.  I just want to stand out. 
[01:25:00]  The bright pink, you know, a little shocking to people.  A lot of hair.  Well, it's not.  A little bright.  It's nice.  Very good.  Please pull them away.  All right.  How are you?  Thank you.  I'm Jonathan from Switzerland, Zurich.  Oh, are you?  That's a long way.  What fan is that?  And who do you think the winners are going to be for every category?  Definitely.  You're going to be all the way on the top.  Who are you hoping to see here besides you two?  You're hoping to see them here?  Bono?  You two?  What's you two?  Are you hoping to see... 
[01:25:30]  I'm hoping to see you two.  Did you get the best?  I'm asking you.  Oh, you two as a group?  Yeah.  Come on.  You're playing games with me.  No.  Yes, you are.  Are you hoping to see...  Like, are you hoping to see, like, Backstreet Boys and Sink?  Backstreet what?  Backstreet Boys.  Sink.  Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi.  What is it?  Is that something to eat?  McDonald's?  Is that something to eat?  Where are you from?  I told you, from Switzerland, Zurich.  And, you know, what kind of music do you listen to on Switzerland? 
[01:26:00]  Oh, I hope to see Mozart and Beethoven tonight.  Oh, Jesus, forget it.  Come on, we're at the opera.  We're at the opera.  Even foreigners have fun.  But there's the MTV Video Music Awards.  Oh, I didn't know that.  There's no opera here.  Oh, my, I got the wrong ticket.  I got the ticket for tomorrow night.  Well, you're hoping to see, what, Janet Jackson?  Janet, Janet what?  Get them away from him.  All right.  Let's get them away.  I don't know those people.  I'm sorry.  I think he has Kurt Waltz on living on his face.  Do you want to know where I have my outfit from? 
[01:26:30]  No.  I got this T-shirt for $2.  Gucci.  Oh.  Very good.  Enjoy your food here.  Asking the press about their outfit.  Have a great time.  All right, you two mutants, get over here where it's open.  What do you think is going to win in every category?  Okay.  Hey, Lady Di.  Lady Di.  Ask what that lady's doing in front of our booth here.  They're moving.  Tell them to move or you'll kick their ass.  We're from our opening answer to the show.  Do you want to ask you a couple questions?  Coward.  Where are you from? 
[01:27:00]  Oh, my God.  I don't want to be on the opening answer to the show.  What does she just say?  She doesn't want to be on the show.  She doesn't want to be on the show, Ben?  No.  She was horrified.  Completely horrified.  Did you see?  Ben, have them interview the vacuum lady.  Dude, you didn't see this.  She looked at Marion holding the mic and coward.  Like, she was thrown back.  And then she walked away as quickly as she can.  That's a good thing, though, because they will keep the front of this clear.  Right.  Just looking at people, they will run to flee for their life. 
[01:27:30]  Hey, the vacuum.  Look at Opie.  Opie hates the vacuum.  We are now listening to the sounds of the vacuum that is cleaning the red carpet here  at the VMAs.  And Opie horrified.  Listen to that, Opie.  That is the very vacuum that is cleaning the carpet here, folks.  How exciting is this?  Vacuum lady.  What kind of vacuum are you using?  What kind of vacuum?  Miss, what kind of vacuum are you using?  It doesn't work well. 
[01:28:00]  It looks like you need a new vacuum.  Yeah, yeah, I agree.  Look at it.  I mean, it looks really bad.  You need a new vacuum cleaner.  They got to get you a new vacuum cleaner.  Like, she needs this.  Hey, did you change the bag before you used it?  Look at her.  She's so picking up.  The woman's all of us.  She's so pissed.  She's trying to do her job.  She's not picking up anything.  She needs a new vacuum cleaner.  Lady Di, talk to the vacuum lady.  She does need a new vacuum cleaner.  And she went way on the other side of the carpet, too.  She's got to come back, though. 
[01:28:30]  She's vacuuming concrete to her.  Well, you're done.  You've got to change the bag.  The bag will rip.  You don't have dirt flying all over the place.  Maybe she could use your pad to soak up the dirt with.  She's fine.  She's trying the best.  Marion, tell her you prefer the Hoover.  Marion, tell her you prefer the Hoover.  I like Eureka.  Oh, look at her ad-libbing.  She's ad-libbing.  Wow.  A dirt devil.  Right.  Dirt devil is good, too. 
[01:29:00]  She's a dirt devil.  The lady is just horrified trying to ignore the Tarla Verne, Shirley.  And she can't get away because she's got to, like, you know, she's only got so much board.  Get the back in the rug.  Poor woman.  We've got sound checks going on in the crowd now.  So I'm looking down the red carpet.  Just packed.  They are shoulder to shoulder.  And I guess shortly we might see a celebrity.  Some lady's holding up a sign that says Telenunda, Channel 47.  She would change the bag. 
[01:29:30]  She's still harassing her.  I mean...  No, now she's harassing the MTV security guy.  No, no.  We didn't call you an old bag.  She should have changed the bag.  No.  Jesus.  Good one.  She said...  He's yelling.  We wouldn't do that.  What are you saying, Marion?  I'm trying to tell the guy that whoever gave the vacuum cleaner, they should have changed  the bag.  Apologize.  Apologize.  You apologize.  No.  Let me see your credentials.  Get out.  No.  Let me see your credentials. 
[01:30:00]  No.  We're trying to say that whoever gave the vacuum cleaner, they should have changed the  vacuum cleaner bag.  Where's your credential?  Well, you have to clean the area.  So you need to do people insult me, you know?  I'm not insulting you.  I'm not insulting you.  Hey, sir.  And you left.  Oh, I'm trying to say that.  The vacuum cleaner bag.  All right.  We almost got kicked out.  No, look.  Marion.  Marion and Di, leave a nice man alone.  Leave him alone.  Right.  We will.  You're getting excited now, and you're getting rambunctious.  I am sorry.  You'll be like the 10% I threw out for this.  See what happened?  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  But I understand. 
[01:30:30]  But look, look.  But look at them, you know?  They're special.  They're a little special.  What?  What?  What?  What the hell?  What?  A face only a mother could love.  A face only a mother could love.  A mother beluga whale, maybe.  That is wonderful.  Well, girls, you, girls, be on your best behavior.  I know why the lions are young, huh?  You behave.  Or else you're going to behave.  What did you guys do?  No, Ben, what happened?  You were there.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.  Ben, what happened? 
[01:31:00]  They were yelling, you've got to change the bag.  He thought they called him an old bag and got pissed.  Because Marion said, you've got the old bag.  It sounded like you're an old bag.  All right.  Oh, my God.  It's good that she didn't have anything to say about something like a hockey puck.  We've all been thrown out.  Anthony, I'm thinking we should take a break because it looks like it's going to heat up.  We could get some commercials out of the way, and then we could go a really long time.  All right, let's do that.  We'll try to make nice with everybody so Marion and Di don't get thrown out of here.  All right, so we almost got thrown out by the security guard. 
[01:31:30]  The head of the security guard.  This bitch in the blonde hair doesn't like the Opie and Anthony show.  And Alien Ant Farm is doing a sound check, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right, we'll be back.  We're outside the VMAs.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Live from the red carpet.  Ah!  What are you doing?

[01:33:00]  1027 WNEW, New York.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We're on the road today outside the VMAs, right, Anthony?  Yes.  And, man, a lot has been going on here.  We're still waiting for some action on the red carpet.  But in the meantime, Lady Di and Marion, they're eating some fat-free pretzels and potato chips.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They're very excited that they didn't have to leave their post there. 
[01:33:30]  It's 9 o'clock this morning.  And people actually ran and got them their stuff.  They're like celebrities.  Yeah, you guys got peeps now working for you.  How does it feel, right?  It feels good.  You wanted something to eat, and then look what happened.  Someone got you something to eat, right?  Yeah, there you go.  It's a lot nicer than leaning into a trough, isn't it?  What?  Jim Norton, everyone.  What was that?  Do you have somewhere to go, like Carolinian or...  You guys need any...  Trud's factory?  You need any blow, any coke or anything?  Everyone's doing the blow these days.  You sure? 
[01:34:00]  You need some E?  We're not.  Yeah, how about some E?  No.  We don't do that.  Wait a second.  For the record, I overheard them say we need some Xanax.  You need some Xanax?  A little prescription drug addicts over here.  Yes, you did.  You like the prescription drugs?  Wait, who needs the Xanax?  Everyone's doing it.  Nobody.  Just joking.  I am so glad.  We're a little nervous, okay?  So that's why.  Are you nervous?  Oh, so the Xanax will calm you down?  No.  You know what I love?  You know what I love?  The fact that right where we are, no matter who the celebrity is, how big they are, they 
[01:34:30]  can get no further than about five feet away from retarded Laverne and Shirley.  That's the furthest they could possibly get.  It's really amazing.  They are right there, I mean, the cream of the crop of entertainers have to walk right  past this view.  Anthony, we should have Lady Di and Marion ask the fine folks to our right.  There's about 200 media people right next to us.  Yeah, yeah.  Ask them if they have any Xanax so they can calm down.  Ask them what, yeah, yeah, we can ask them what drugs they're doing. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, Lady Di.  Yes.  What drug do you need?  I don't need anything.  Xanax?  Vicodin?  I'm thinking if you ask the people to our right, you're going to get some Xanax.  You want some Vicodin?  I don't need anything.  Lithium?  Thank you very much.  Marion?  Prozac?  I'm sure for anything.  You need the Zoloft?  I took my vitamins this morning.  I take the Zoloft to keep killing y'all.  I am just so glad that we didn't get kicked out.  We were this close to getting booed in.  Yeah, and then the security guard took a serious look at these two and realized, okay, they can't help it.  He thought we were funny.  He thought we were cool. 
[01:35:30]  He was cool.  He didn't think you were cool.  No one thinks you were cool.  He was laughing at us.  He thinks we're nuts.  I don't care what you people think about us.  We're crazy.  Does it bother you that you have a body like a Komodo dragon?  Go ahead.  Come back to him.  Marion, you're thinking.  Yeah, Komodo dragon.  Go ahead, Marion.  Little short clawing arms.  She's thinking right now.  Like a tree symbol.  Marion, you're going to let him treat you like that?  You got bald spot on your head?  Oh!  He's called you Mr. Clean.  He shaves his head. 
[01:36:00]  He needs his earring.  That's all he needs.  He's on bald.  He needs his earring.  He's on bald, but all the bald guys to our right are a little pissed off now.  That's all right.  He shaves his head.  Are you excited?  You starting to get excited about this?  Look at this guy.  They were more excited about the barbecue potato chips the people brought up.  Why don't we have them interview some more media people?  Should we?  We wait for us and celebrities to walk down the red carpet.  Lady Diane Marion, follow Ben and Rick.  Here they go.  Just as Laverne Shirley getting to know our fellow media people. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  There's a lot of media here today.  This is the biggest event happening.  You'll be in the Anthony show.  Hi.  How are you?  Okay.  What brings you here tonight?  What are you hoping to see?  Why don't you ask him who he is first?  Yeah.  Who are you?  Yeah.  Who are you anyway?  From Scott.  From where?  Time Warner.  Okay.  And who are you hoping to see?  Britney.  Besides Britney Spears, who else?  I don't know.  Christopher Walken.  You got Marion.  Why would you need to see Britney? 
[01:37:00]  Well, actually, I came here to see Opie and Anthony.  She's a hot blonde.  Marion's another hot blonde like Britney.  Yeah.  And who else are you hoping to see?  I don't know.  Everybody.  I mean, he's already disgusted.  Fat boy's slim.  Look, he's just, he's annoyed with them.  Okay.  Who else?  Best female?  I don't know.  Janet Jackson.  Yeah, Janet Jackson is good.  No?  Marion.  Yeah, she's not going to be.  The lady dies in useless.  Who else are you hoping to see over here? 
[01:37:30]  I'm the guy.  Who else?  I don't know.  I'm just here to shoot.  Yeah, you're the camera guy for time long, right?  I want to see everybody.  You know, everybody.  I'm a big fan of everybody.  Rick, move on to the guy that's laughing like a little schoolgirl to his right.  Do I have a favorite?  I don't know.  I like Incubus.  Well, actually, Dave Matthews I really want to see.  Do you like you, too?  Yeah.  I like you, too, too.  Hopefully.  All right.  Thank you.  Hopefully.  Filling you in.  Thank you.  Okay, hi. 
[01:38:00]  Who are you?  I'm Tony from Miami.  Hi, Tony from Miami.  Radio station, TV station.  Radio.  Radio.  Okay.  What radio station?  Power 96.  There you go.  Power 96.  Yeah, I've been hearing him for the past five years.  Okay.  So, see, I know you guys want to ask me the question, but I got a question for you.  Sure.  Because, you know, your listeners want to know.  You two are right by the red carpet.  Yeah.  We want to know what you guys are going to ask your favorite stars.  That's what we want to know.  Whatever comes to our minds.  That's what we want to know.  Give me a hint.  See, because I want to know. 
[01:38:30]  Wait.  Give him a celebrity.  All right.  How about if you see Britney Spears or NSYNC there?  What are you going to ask them?  Ask them, who is, uh, no, no, if I see Britney Spears or NSYNC, I'm asking who do they think  is going to win for best video?  Oh, come on.  They want some good props.  They want to win for best video.  What about the group?  How about Afro Man?  What are you going to ask Afro Man?  Once again, I love Afro Man.  Are you going to ask them if he's high?  Yeah, we're going to ask them if they're high. 
[01:39:00]  She knows who they are.  I don't.  Oh, yeah.  I love their new song.  She knows who they are.  Oh, you like that song?  I want to win an award for that.  Yes, I do.  I do like that song.  It's almost like Ying Yang Party.  Yes, it is almost like Ying Yang Party.  Ying Yang Party.  All right, they're just battling.  And who are you wearing?  What are you wearing?  Where'd you buy this at?  Where'd you buy your clothes?  Our clothes at?  Yeah.  Your outfit is, like, kicking.  You got some, like, I don't know.  You got some spandex pants on.  Yeah.  Some, like, black suede shoes. 
[01:39:30]  Right?  Yeah.  Where'd you get your hair to do at?  What about my power?  You already power.  I got my hair to do at.  I got your hair to do at.  Me?  You do.  I got your hair.

What is that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  How about what's her name?  What's her name?  Dana?  Lady Di. 
[01:40:00]  Lady Di.  Yeah.  What's up with that wacky belt?  Did you buy that in 1989?  1988.  I bought this belt.  Wacky belt.  I bought it in 1988.  You almost got it right.  It holds the bun tint, is what we like to say.  Well, it puts it in two sections.  I want to go buy one of these shirts for my mom, the one you're wearing.  God damn, that's exactly what it is.  Keep looking.  I'm not going to tell me where you bought it.  No, I bought it at the mall.  And what's up with Lady Di and her woe or wow?  Wow, it says wow.  What's that for? 
[01:40:30]  One of your ex-boyfriends did you do that?  I bought this.  Isn't that the sorriest bling, bling you've ever seen?  No.  It's like the thinnest.  It's like a pop-top half thin.  It's not even thick gold.  It's nice bling, bling.  I had to make money for that.  I had to make money for that.  A strong breeze would bend that stuff.  I had to make a...  That's tin tin.  It costs me a lot of tin tin.  I'll tell you that right now.  That costs you nothing.  That's nothing.  You guys are some lucky guys. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Are you funny or are you think we're nutty?  You're nutty.  Thank you.  Yeah, there are dates.  We're both.  Yeah.  But we're trying.  You want me with them to win?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you feel pretty bad for us, right?  Yeah, I do.  We're trying to pick up questions right now to ask the musicians.  Merry Christmas.  Happy New Year.  All right, ladies.  Happy Halloween.  Leave the nice gentleman alone.  Happy Halloween.  It's so good that we could share the abuse.  I know.  See, it's not just us saying it.  It's in fun of the retarded.  Like, he's saying the same stuff. 
[01:41:30]  You mentioned the hair, the clothes, the belt, the shoes, the pants.  Yeah.  Hey, there's the vacuum lady.  Just the two most horrendous dumpers you'll ever see.  They're beanbags.  Hey, yo.  Hi, how are you?  How are you?  How are you doing?  Okay, how are you?  Great.  So what do you do over here for the MTV Music Awards?  And where do you guys have to do it from?  They're walking away.  Horrified.  Say her.  She's horrified.  No, she wasn't.  Merry, keep quiet.  No, she wasn't.  She just horrified the poor MTV people.  They're special.  They're special. 
[01:42:00]  Look, everyone else is like, no, no, leave us alone.  Leave us alone.  They're special.  They're okay.  They're special.  Thank you so much, Anthony.  I like the hairdo.  He looks like Whitecloth Jean.  Who was that?  Who was that?  It was just some guy.  He looked like Whitecloth Jean.  Whitecloth Jean.  Whitecloth Jean.  Whitecloth Jean.  Whitecloth.  Whitecloth.  You like the hairdo?  Did you like that?  No, he told me to ask.  You getting a little jungle fever there, girl?

All right, ladies.  They are horrifying people.  It's almost time.  Yeah.  Okay.  Very close.  We are so close now.  I just saw some of the news cameras putting up their camera like somebody should be approaching  any minute now, I think. 
[01:43:00]  Yes, and everyone's pushing forward in the media tent.  But I hear no screeches, no screaming.  Oh, look at that.  People getting on the ladders.  Yeah, it's about show time.  I sure hope so, because I can't talk to these two anymore.  And they're chasing away.  Look at the girl that said, I have something to do.  What's going on, man?  I can't talk now.  They claim this guy's in disguise, so they're trying to get him.  Shoveling chips into her mouth.  How are you doing?  Okay, very good.  Who are you?  What are you doing over here?  What am I doing over here?  I'm hanging out.  What are you guys doing over here? 
[01:43:30]  I'm doing the thing you guys are doing.  We're hanging out, too.  It's you, maybe?  Interviewing people.  Oh, cool.  I'm a good interview.  Okay.  I like to talk.  I like to flop my gums.  I like the jacket.  Where did you get it from?  It's a very old jacket.  It's a vintage jacket.  I don't know the age.  I like the hat, too.  Probably as old as you.  Where did you get the hat?  I got it from my closet.  Yeah.  It's been in there for a while.  Looks like it's been there for a while.  I'm a Tom Land.  Who are you?  My name is David Haynes. 
[01:44:00]  From where?  David Haynes.  From Queens.  Queens?  Mm-hmm.  We're from New Jersey.  We're from Jersey.  You work for Radio Station, TV Station, or you're just...

Who did you?  I told them I found them on the floor.  I found them.  I was walking on the red carpet.  Is there anyone on the floor?  We'd like to have one of those.  Hey, lady, die.  If I spot some out, I'll put one of them.  Are you famous?  Because you look like you're in disguise.  No, I'm not famous.  You do.  You look like you're in disguise. 
[01:44:30]  You really do.  I'm in disguise.  Who does he look like?  You really do.  I don't know.  You don't know?  Maybe someone from NSYNC?  Yeah, well, I'm not.  Are you in disguise?  No.  Is that a wig you're wearing?  This is actually wearing?  No, it's not a wig.  Are you sure?  Are those your real glasses?  Yeah.  Are they your real glasses?  You want to try them on?  No.  You sure?  Try them on.  You look like your television reporter.  What?  Cagney and Lacey.  Who he looks like.  Maybe, yeah, that's right.  He do.  You look like somebody from New Kids on a Block. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, you want me to do a dance step for you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Want me to do a dance move?  Oh, yeah.  It's the radio, though.  The audience at home really can't enjoy it.  The audience at home can't enjoy it if I saw a dance.  So retarded.  Which new kid?  Which new kid, yo?  Oh, which new kid on the block?  I don't know.  You know, I have this little doll at home.  It's called a troll.  You kind of resemble him a little bit.  No, no.  The little troll dolls?  The new redone bullets.  No, she gets to come back every time.  Are you Gary Coleman's son-to?  No, are you?  Try these on.  Try them on.  Try them on for the audience, please. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, all right.  What do I do?  I'm doing nothing.  I'm hanging out.  Yeah, I'm actually looking for a nice young lady.  I got a, yes, you a question.  Who are you hoping to win?  You get to choose any one of these, but you have to service the, you know, you have to clean the pipes.  You don't want to clean your pipes.  No, thank you.  Get any wins then.  Job.  No, we don't want to clean your pipes.  So basically, I'm showing you.  We're nice girls.  We're a lot of fun.  We're nice girls.  All right.  All right, ladies, leave the gentleman alone. 
[01:46:00]  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Leave the nice guy alone.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  They're special.  They're special.  They're very special.  To us.  They're very special.  They're special.  All right.  Very special.  What a great job they did.  You know what?  It was great.  You see these two and you can't help it.  You have to abuse them.  Because I know people get really pissed when we do this, but they can't help it.  You can't help it.  And it's all the same shots.  Who are you?  I have your shirt. 
[01:46:30]  It's in my house.  It's called a dishrag.  No, it ain't.  Every time you went through your jacket, that jacket was...  You were just complimenting me on my jacket.  Listen, don't get into a bickering battle with me because I'll throw it down.  Yes, I will.  I'll throw it down too, buddy.  I got my friend here.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's box.  Sure time, let's say.  No.  All right, ladies.  Let's pull the ladies back.  Because I'm hearing some excitement now from the front of the crowd.  They're just making them cheer again. 
[01:47:00]  They're making them cheer.  The beautiful people are cheering.  Wow.  That was a good exchange right there, huh?  Wow.  You know, if half the interviews go that well, I think we have a goldmine here today.  They've had a lot of good practice.  Now, you know, the real celebrity is going to be heading our way in hopefully a few minutes here.  What we were saying earlier, though, it's this everyone has to take the same shots.  It's their bad clothes, their bad hair, and just the shape of them.  Hey, hi.  How are you?  Hello.  All right.  Come here.  Can I ask a question? 
[01:47:30]  She can't even say the word question.  Look, she's like, no, I can't.  Oh, all right.  We'll get you later on, then, when everybody walks by.  We'll get you later.  We'll get you.  I'll find some way to interview you.  We'll interview you somehow.  Her ass is square.  Lady Di, your ass is square.  Lady Di, you've got a square ass.  What?  Your ass looks like a lego.  What?  It looks like a lego.  You are a square.  Let me see.  Turn around.  You are.  That's okay, though.  It's all right. 
[01:48:00]  No, turn around.  It takes all kinds.  Look at that.  Look, it's square.  I figured out why she's wearing the belt now.  Why?  So you can see where, figure out where the ass starts.  Where the ass starts?  It's a reverse flatso.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Marion.  You know, I'd hit that.  Yeah.  It's a little muscle.  It's a little muscle.  I work out.  We'll let that one just sit.  You can lift muscle on a T-Rex leg.  Look at that thing.  It looks like a T-Rex leg.  But, Anthony, turn around. 
[01:48:30]  Let me check yours out.  No, that's okay.  Can I check yours out?  That's all right.  How about yours?  How about yours, Jim?  Hey, look, a fertile loom.  They're getting abused from across the red carpet.  They're totally ragging on them over across the line.  I can't believe you.  These are just...  Hey, Tattoo Man, where you got your tattoos from?  You got a little bit too many tattoos on you.  You got a lot of tattoos on you.  You know, you look like somebody, you know...  You're a tattoo artist.  What?  Somebody you want?  Okay.  Come on, come on.  I want to interview you.  I want to know where you got those sexy tattoos from. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  I like tattoos.  I mean, we do.  We like tattoos.  I want to know if you're in a motorcycle gang.  Do you got tattoos all over?  Why is everyone ducking down?  Marion?  Marion.  You know, a guy lives a lifestyle maybe you don't know about.  Remember in the studio...  I like tattoos.  I like tattoos, too.  Remember in the studio we were talking about Suge Knight?  That's Suge Knight.  Chill out.  Who?  What's that?  No winning.  Ask him.  He'll tell you. 
[01:49:30]  Ask him.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I have no idea who he is.  Just ask him.  That's Suge Knight.  Excuse me, sir.  Are you Suge Knight?  Are you...  Say it again.  Are you Suge Knight, sir?  I'm not answering.  He's not answering.  He's ignoring us.  Because he's Suge Knight.  Of course he's not going to answer you.  He's a white guy.  Excuse me.  Are you Suge Knight?  What are you saying?  I have no idea. 
[01:50:00]  Okay.  Do we have a video camera for him?  Suge Knight's brother.  All right.  You do it in the sills.  All right.  Leave the guy alone.  Well, we're still waiting.  They're special.  They're special, sir.  It's okay.  They're special.  They're special.  We're very special.  Have you guys mugged anybody lately?  Robbed anybody?  Pick-pocked anybody?  Marion.  Shut up.  The guy's just...  Have you shot anybody? 
[01:50:30]  Maybe you better...  Marion.  Maybe you better shut up now.  Let's chill out a little bit, okay?  You better just cool out.  This is going to be a travesty  if we have to end our show  without interviewing any celebrities.  Guys.  I'm seeing...  But we're going to stay here  after 7, Anthony,  and tape a lot of stuff  for tomorrow's show.  Yeah, let's do that.  I'm going to interview you, sir.  How are you doing?  Who are you?  What are you wearing?  I'm so stupid.  Where'd you get that from? 
[01:51:00]  Hey, hey, you guys calm down  until some celebrities come.  You too.  Some guy's making faces.  How are you wearing the coal?  He flipped his eyelids off  and made faces at Marion and a lady died.  A yin-yang party.  That's right.  Yay, yin-yang party.  Yay.  They're grabbing their junk  and shaking it at the girl.  Marion, you don't want to hang out  with those guys  because you'll end up  on a pinball machine.  He's lifting his leg  and pointing to his bones.  We don't have mice. 
[01:51:30]  Holy Jesus.  All right.  Well, good.  Why don't we take a break?  Ladies, can we interview you?  Excuse me.  They're tech people.  They're not...  They're no one.  Would you calm down?  Listen, let's take a break.  Let's do that.  I hear people screaming.  I sure hope...  We don't have much time  left in the show today,  so, I mean,  but we're going to tape  a lot of stuff for tomorrow's show.  Yeah, hell yeah.  Tomorrow's show is shaping up  to be a really, really good one  because we'll have  the Retard Laverne Shirley  celebrity interviews

All right, we're back 
[01:53:30]  with the Opie and Anthony  program outside the VMAs,  Anthony.  Yeah.  Still waiting for something  to go on.  I hope we made this  interesting for you guys  today.  We just saw the T-200,000  chick walk by.  There were like five of them.  I don't know who they were  from or where they were  from.  They ran down the carpet  very quickly escorted by  people right into the  front door, right past us  when we were doing  commercials. 
[01:54:00]  But, oh, my God.  It wasn't reality hot.  It was like some kind of  sci-fi hotness that doesn't  occur in the natural world.  It's like, what do you do  first?  Unbelievable.  Of course, Lady Di and  Marion, our correspondents  on the carpet.  Hi.  Hi.  Right there.  How's it going down there,  ladies?  How we doing?  Oh, we're doing great.  Yeah?  We are doing great.  Oh, boy, we're doing  good.  I think you're doing  very, very good.  Well, a lot of cheering.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  What?  What?  Diane.  We're waiting for the  artists to come by so  this way we can ask the  questions.  We want to ask them a  whole bunch of  questions.  A lot of questions.  And you guys are ready  finally?  Oh, yeah, we're ready.  We're ready.  We are ready.  We're born ready.  We're born ready, right?  We are ready.  We are ready ready.  Ready to party.  All right.  We understand.  Yay-yang party, guys.  Yay-yang party is right.  Hey, there's a fine lady  doing a stand-up shot for  one of the networks to the  right of us there.  Very rare to see an Asian 
[01:55:00]  lady doing news these days.  That's right, Gordon.  You do never see that.  Right on, man.  Right on.  And just all the cheering,  but we're not seeing  celebrities.  And this thing starts  pretty shortly.  Wasn't the whole reason  us being outside the VMAs  was so we could interview  people?  So these two morons  could interview people.  Look at that.  Doesn't Marion look like  a shell-less turtle?  Can you picture her  crawling in sand and  laying eggs on a leaf? 
[01:55:30]  Little leathery eggs.  They're just babbling  nonstop.  Ladies, ladies,  here comes somebody.  Let's see who they are,  okay?  Look at her back.  Oh, they stopped.  Look at her back fat.  Look at Marion's back fat.  She's got back boobs.  She's got back boobs.  Back boobs.  We have a view of  Marion's back boobs  and Lady Di's.  Look at that Lego square  ass.  Like a refrigerator box.  We have the worst view  in the house.  The back of these two  friggin' atrocities.  Look at this. 
[01:56:00]  Ask her where she got her  top.  Lady.  Marion.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  Hello?  Wow, come here.  She's like one minute  and running away.  She holds up the one  minute hand and runs  away.  Yeah, a really,  really hot chick.  Yeah, she had a  cut-up halter top on.  You know, Anthony,  we say this a lot on our  show.  God definitely has a  sense of humor because,  man, you mix up the DNA  and this happens.  Yeah.  And then you mix it a  little differently and  that hot piece of ass  happens.  It's like a penguin  looking at a hawk  flying. 
[01:56:30]  You know, you're both  birds, but that one's  soaring and you're never  getting off the ground.  Well, that's just, it's a  penguin analogy.  You don't like penguins?  All right, enough.  All right.  Let's relax, relax.  All right.  Oh, now we're rocking.  Alien Ed Barman today.  I'm busting our chops.  Yeah, you are busting our chops.  We're going to take out your  tampar again.  Don't make us take out your  Kotex pad again.  Oh, no.  Lady Di's dancing now to 
[01:57:00]  Alien Ed Barman.  No, no, no.  Get a mic on these, too.  I wouldn't.  Lady Di.  Yes.  You like Alien Ed Barman?  Yes, I do.  Yeah?  I like that group.  You like it?  What do they sing?  I like that combo.  They do that song by  Michael Jackson.  Annie, are you walking?  You hear it?  What group is that?  I don't know the name of  that group.  What's the name of that  group?  It's Alien Ed Farm.  What is it?  Ed Farm?  Alien Ed Farm. 
[01:57:30]  Alien Ed Farm.  What's the name again?  Ed Farm.  No, Alien Ed Farm.  Look in the mirror  to remember the alien part,  you freak.  All right.  Al, Alien Farm.  Can we move the tables  over there watching?  Well, obviously,  no one's going to walk  down the red carpet  while these guys are playing.  You sure?  Yeah, so we've got  to find some more fun.  Goddamn.  Yeah, we come out here.  Oh, my God.  Look at the guys dancing  in the other radio.  Right behind you.  Right behind you.  Oh, my God. 
[01:58:00]  A little swishy.  A little swishy.  That move has probably  been done in front  of so many man-fin junk.  Wow.  Stop.  Talking about the gun.  What, Ben?  Dude, holding the microphone  in front of Lady Diall,  all you hear, feel is this  really hot, heavy breath,  just, ah, all over my hands,  like, ah.  The cameras are up,  but I guess they're just  getting that footage  that they show  before the piece. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, we have a lot of  celebrities behind us.  I don't know if they're  going to head our way  or not.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  Who's...  I can't tell.  They just look attractive,  but I don't know  who they are.  And who's the big  front one in the white shirt?  She's not famous.  Missy Elliott?  No, she's white.  Oh.  Where?  Which one are you talking about?  The one with the tight...  Well, she's got big cans, though.  All right, hey, ladies,  we've got some celebrities  to our left.  Watch this, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  They're complete nobodies,  but we've got to do 
[01:59:00]  something else.  Totally non-famous people.  Oh, no.  Oh, they're children.  Hi, who are you?  Excuse me.  What's all the stories  in the Anthony show?  We want to ask you  a couple questions.  Who are you?  I'm no one.  Oh, you just got a pass  to get in?  Oh, okay.  It's a child, for God's sake.  She's eight.  You're going to have a good time.  I see you're a Knicks fan.  What do you think  you're going to do next season?  Everyone's back in.  They're running away. 
[01:59:30]  That's a ruined childhood  of forever nightmares  that will never, ever go away.  Ladies, stay away  from the really big guys  that look like they can kill us.  Oh, my God.  Look at that guy.  Wow.  Don't say anything  to that guy.  That guy looks like  Biggie Smalls.  Yes, he does.  Doesn't he look like Biggie?  He looks like a little Biggie.  Well, we're trying  to get some action here.  Yeah, I'm looking  behind me now.  Who's that?  They look familiar,  but I don't know 
[02:00:00]  who they are.  What about those guys?  There's nobody here.  Okay, there's nobody  back here.  Here, talk to that guy  with the weird hat.  Hi, how are you?  I'm from the ball.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hi, we're from audio  Oakley and Anthony's show.  I'm Marion, as lady as I am.  How are you doing?  Who are you?  I'm Marion, as I am.  We're from the Oakley and Anthony's show.  Nice to see you.  Where do you like to go?  I'm Jared.  I'm the quintessential king  of New York.  Always going to all the parties,  and here I am today  here at the MTV Music Video. 
[02:00:30]  Okay, I've got to ask you  a question.  Who do you think is going to win  for best pop vocal,  pop video,  I mean,  male, female?  Where's the parties  at tonight?  You're going to all the parties,  so you're in the room.  Hey, where can we  yin-yang party?  That's where the party is.  What hotel room?  A secret chip.  You guys want to know  where it's at?  Find the hotel room  and you'll find the party.  Can you ask  a little secret?  I mean,  we want to know.  We want to go  yin-yang party with you guys.  That's right, we do.  We invite these two fools  to the party. 
[02:01:00]  All right,  we'll follow the livos.  Hey, where'd you get  the outfit?  Nice outfit.  That is a beautiful outfit.  I like it.  I like the hat.  All right, ladies,  leave the party guy alone.  I like the hat.  Okay?  Like, you would want  these two freaks  at your party.  All right.  They look like  they should be  squatting over  a library entrance.  So, Ellie and Antoine,  I'm finishing up  their song, Opie.  So, hopefully...  No, I ain't done with you.  All right, ladies,  leave the guy alone.  Why don't we head over  to this section, okay?  Yeah, bring him back  around front, Rick.  You guys kind of good looking. 
[02:01:30]  And, um...  No, come here.  No.  You think that guy  was good looking?  I think you're  on the wrong team, though.  He thought you were  a good looking guy, too.  What do you think?  I think it was cute.  We went to hang out  and party with him.  Yay, yay.  Oh, my God.  No problem.  It might take...  Who's coming down the carpet?  We love to get in the party.  Anyone?  I see people walking down.  Yeah, people are starting  to make their way  down the red carpet, finally.  So, ladies, get into position 
[02:02:00]  and let's see what we could  get going on here, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  People waving.  People starting to head inside.  God, we could have...  We could have come here  like a half hour ago.  I know.  We've had to deal with these two  the whole goddamn show.  I do believe it was  pretty entertaining, though, today.  Yeah, I've been having fun.  And it's more fun  watching other people  goof on these, too.  So you could really appreciate it  than goofing on them yourself, even.  We should remind people  tomorrow we're going to have  all the audio from today  because we're going to stay 
[02:02:30]  after 7, so it'll be  all new audio.  It'll be the meat  of the celebrity interviews  with Lady Diane Marion.  Also, Mario Cantone  coming in tomorrow, Anthony.  That's your point.  Oh, hopefully he'll watch  and be able to critique  the VNAs.  I would love to meet him.  Who?  Mario Cantone.  Well, he's going to be  on our show tomorrow.  Oh, man.  We'll call the show tomorrow.  Yeah, we'll call the show.  Oh, yeah.  Okay?  Okay, sure.  This will confirm  his gayness to himself  because you look at them  and it's just like...  Ladies, you're getting  a little tired 
[02:03:00]  talking to the microphones,  okay?  Okay.  Yeah.  See, it's been a long  show for you guys.  You're never on this one.  It has.  We usually kick your asses out  before you've been on this long.  All right, we assigned you  people and stuff  to hold your microphone.  Okay.  Here, talk to your  friend earlier.  If you want to party at,  we'll go meet you.  We'll meet you over there.  Wait, wait.  Have him talk again  really fast.  Come on.  Yeah, I'm looking,  trying to see  who's coming down.  You have your own party  going on right here. 
[02:03:30]  Hey.  You don't need,  you don't need  no other people  to party with.  Yeah, why not?  You should go party  with somebody else.  Why?  We're a lot of fun.  You, you know...  You sound like a nice person.  You're very, very nice.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I can't party with you all.  Are you going to party?  So what are you wearing  for your party tonight?  Oh, we're wearing,  will we have on?  Oh, we're wearing,  we have on.  You're not going to shower?  No, we showered,  we showered this morning.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  You work all day.  We've been out here  in the hot sun  for like how many hours, 
[02:04:00]  four hours going on?  Yeah, and they're just  going to go party  in their own sweat.  Who's going to pick  you girls up tonight?  Nobody.  Nobody.  Do you honestly think  a shower would help?  You know,  the inside of those panties  smells like a mausoleum.  You all should go backstage  and party with Puff Daddy  tonight.  P-Diddy.  P-Diddy.  P-Diddy.  Not Puff Daddy.  This month is P-Diddy.  Now, who's walking down?  Who's walking down?  Ladies, get in position.  Get in position  because someone's  walking down.  It's the real world, 
[02:04:30]  it looks like the real world  New York cast coming.  Yeah, some of the guys  from the real world,  New York.  Oh, is that it?  You guys watch the real world?  You watch the real world?  Who are you?  No, what?  Just working here.  What do you do here?  No, no, ladies.  Oh, from where?  MTV?  What?  From where MTV?  No.  Okay, we're from  Mary and Diane from MTV.  What do you think?  We can see your underwear.  You've got to fix your pants  a little bit.  No, that's not long.  No, that's the look.  Marion, that's the look.  Marion, the good look now 
[02:05:00]  is the hip huggers  with the underwear  sticking out of the tap.  That's hilarious.  Hey, ladies, get ready.  Here's the real world cast.  The real world's coming.  And since the real world  has been so kind to you two.  I love the fans.  All right, come on, come on.  Let's get some interview.  Well, they're answering  questions and stuff.  Here, ladies, if you yell,  those two right there  will come toward us.  Hey, ladies.  Hello.  Real world.  Excuse me.  Keep screaming real world.  Real world. 
[02:05:30]  Louder.  Real world.  Oh, shut up.  I can't take that voice.  Here's one of the real world  cast members  with lovely cleavage.  Hi, how are you doing?  What can I do you for?  Hi.  How are you?  How are you?  I'm great.  What world are you guys in?  I'm in the real world.  What's that?  I don't know.  I can barely make it up.  I don't realize I don't even know.  What about the Survivors?  You ever watch the Survivor Series?  They're horrified.  They're just running away.  They just ran away. 
[02:06:00]  Hi, are you in the real world, too?  Yeah.  What about the Survivors?  I don't know.  I don't think they survived  the trip over here.  What is that all about?  What about the real world?  I think they got pretty messed up.  It's like, yeah.  Is that where you guys  get kicked out every week?  No, it's a different one.  Oh, that's the big brother.  That's the same thing, isn't it?  Hey, yo, I like your hair.  Where'd you get it?  I use afro sheen, too.  Are you afro, man?  It's the guy with the big afro  from real world New York.  That's what I heard.  I love these guys.  I live all the time in Cleveland, dude. 
[02:06:30]  Are you guys opening it?  Are you from the real world?  I emailed you guys saying  I would do an interview or whatever, dude.  I love you guys.  You're hilarious.  Come by the show tomorrow.  Come by the show tomorrow.  Where are you guys at?  Then we'll take care of you.  Hey, what do you think of Marion?  Huh?  What do you think of Marion?  Hot, huh?  I'm Marion.  I'm Lady Di.  I'm Marion.  Hi, man.  They're the retarded  of the Vernon Shirley.  We're just living our lives  on a TV show, you know?  What are you guys wearing?  I mean, what are you guys wearing?  I mean, I like the shirt.  That's nice.  I'm Marco right here.  I'm GQing it out,  you know what I'm saying?  That's nice.  What is your name? 
[02:07:00]  I'm Mike.  And you're who?  Willie.  Willie?  Mike and Willie?  Mike and Willie.  Willie?  Okay.  Oh, Millie?  Millie.  I'm trying to say  from the real world to New York.  This is not going well.  Hey, can I ask you the question?  What channel all your shows are on?  I had some TV with ass.  We saw you in the show.  All right.  Maybe that's why.  All right.  I thought you guys were on.  Yeah.  Cool.  I thought you had one channel, too,  like Survivor and Big Brother.  Okay.  Okay, listen.  We're going to have a real interview 
[02:07:30]  with those guys tomorrow on our show.  Mike and Malik from the real world New York.  Damn, was that painful.  All right.  That's Mike and Willie.  Mike and Willie?  Here, here.  That's Brittany Spears.  You good?  Excuse me.  Yo, hi.  Excuse me.  Hi, Brittany.  All right.  Who are you?  Hey, Brittany.  How you doing?  All right.  People are falling down last night now.  That wasn't Brittany.  It looked like her.  That wasn't Brittany Spears, you ass.  It looked like her, right?  It did look like her. 
[02:08:00]  Sure, why not?  Sure, why not?  All right.  Jeremy Halliwell.  That's who?  Jeremy Halliwell.  From the space girl.  J-Lo, J-Lo.  Hey, hi.  Hey.  I like your outfit.  Hey, Jennifer, come here.  Come here.  Hey, look at that booty.  Shake it, baby.  Shake it, baby.  Woo-hoo.  Would you shut up?  You ass.  Sit down.  She just told Jennifer Lopez that she likes that she is. 
[02:08:30]  I have never seen J-Lo so horrified in my life.  Jennifer Lopez horrified.  I don't think she's ever made that ass move so fast in her life.  You know what happened?  She turned around and looked at Marion and got the same look on her face as in that movie  when the horse got cut into, like, many pieces.  You've got to describe what just happened.  It went by so fast.  Jennifer Lopez walking by.  They're screaming, J-Lo, J-Lo, Jennifer, come here.  J-Lo turns around, looks at Marion and Lady Di, a look of horror on her face, and just double-timed 
[02:09:00]  it right past the front of our little compact.  By the way, no bra, unbelievable dress, unbelievable outfit, whatever you want to call it.  And that famous booty.  Who are you?  And you know, we make fun of the booty on our show.  That booty is nice, Sarah.  Very nice.  I like it.  Amazing.  Girls, wait until they get near you.  This is pretty gross.  You don't have to yell to them when they're there.  Wait until they've got to come right past you.  I like Jennifer Lopez.  And she liked you, Marion, I could tell.  Are you pissed that she didn't stop?  No. 
[02:09:30]  She was in a hurry to get in there.  Yin-yang party.  You see the look she gave you?  She wears, she smiles.  I thought I'd shake your booty.  What's wrong with that?  I thought it was crazy.  I said, shake your booty.  She shook her booty.  She was shaking her booty.  Lovely.  Who do you think's got a better ass, her or Marion?  Lady Di?  Jennifer Lopez got a better ass.  Yeah?  J-Lo.  And Marion, who do you think?  J-Lo or Lady Di?  J-Lo.  Lego ass.  No?  She has to have more needles.  I don't have.  How about a better ass to iron her sketch on?  Can I measure yours?  Hey, Jim.  Turn around. 
[02:10:00]  Can I measure yours between these two?  No, wait.  Okay.  All right.  More people are coming.  Get ready, ladies.  Yes.  You've got to be.  See, this is something.  You've got to be right on the money.  How cool was that, though?  J-Lo.  That was J-Lo right there, walking past.  Looking good.  Looking real good.  Looking real good.  Real good.  Oh, my God.  I was horrified.  I can't.  You know what happens?  Okay.  You know what happens?  They start talking, and when the people actually come over to them,  I have to turn away.  Yeah.  I can't look.  I'm horrified at this.  I got so uncomfortable, I wanted to crawl under the table. 
[02:10:30]  Did you see Norton put his head down?  He was trying to crawl into himself.  It's just embarrassing.  Isn't it?  Standing behind these two manatees.  Yeah, I think I could see the propellum marks from a speedboat on Marion's back.  What, Marion?  What's up, Marion?  With J-Lo?  I'm going to get a Jennifer Lopez butt.  I'm going to start working out more.  You want to have a butt like Jennifer Lopez?  Yeah.  Now, that's a goal.  Love it, love it.  Love it, love it.  The only way to get a butt like...  Now, that's something to strive for.  The only way to get J-Lo's ass for you is to shoot her and cut it out with a knife. 
[02:11:00]  No, I've got to work out more.  That's all we have to do, work out more.  Work out more?  Work out childhood issues, mate.  No.  Work out more.  Work out, die, and be reincarnated as J-Lo.  How about we just start with work out?  Work out.  Hey, did you guys ever join a sports club?  Yeah, look at us.  We're trim now.  You look good.  You look fun.  New York sports club.  All right.  Give us a membership.  Give us a membership.  Right, okay.  Here you go.  More people trying to make their way down. 
[02:11:30]  I don't know.  We're in the place we are over here.  We've got to get a few more of these on the air before we leave the air age today.  That's nobody.  We wait.  She is an employee.  Don't worry about it.  We'll point out when people are coming, Lady Di.  By the way, Jennifer Lopez did not stop her anyway.  No, J-Lo walked past everybody.  That's surprising, isn't it?  I'm sure she spoke with the MTV people who I think are at the beginning of the red carpet. 
[02:12:00]  Because I got high.  What?  What?  What are they babbling about?  Oh, she's singing the Afro Man song.  I'm singing over here.  Are you?  Yeah, I am.  All set.  Ladies, people are passing on the red carpet.  Excuse me.  Hi.  Who are you?  It's Lisa Bonet.  You look like White Club jeans.  Hi, Lisa Bonet.  How are you?  That is Lisa Bonet.  No, it's not.  It certainly isn't.  You want to close me, kid?  You're too stupid.  Oh, my God.  Excuse me.  Are you Lisa Bonet?  Are you Lisa Bonet? 
[02:12:30]  You look like Lisa Bonet.  Are you high?  Do you not?  All right.  Do you know I'm on a close me show?  All right, look.  I have to go.  I have to just leave.  I'm a tattoo man.  I love you, too.  I have to leave the situation.  I have to leave the situation.  I have to leave the situation, right?  Ying, yang.  Would you shut up?  All right.  Would you just shut up?  We love the tattoo man.  We're having fun.  That's all?  Yes, of course you are.  Fun.  And we are having a great time.  I am horrified.  You're horrified.  I can't watch it. 
[02:13:00]  Like, I want to, but...  Oh, my God.  More people making their way down, but it's a slow trip down the carpet because there's  a lot of people that want to talk to the press.  That Jennifer Lopez was worth the price of admission today.  Just the interaction between Jennifer Lopez.  It was quick, but the interaction between Jennifer Lopez and the retarded man, Shirley, I will  never forget that.  Horrific.  She would have had a nicer look on her face if somebody was holding mule diarrhea under 
[02:13:30]  her face.  Horrified.  A lot of big applause.  Hey, Rick.  All right.  We're just waiting now.  Come on.  We need to get a few more people.  All right.  You guys, it looks like some people are making their way down the red carpet.  But wait until they get near you.  You guys are going to have to get aggressive, okay?  Because it looks like they're walking by everybody.  What do you want them to do?  It's not like they're not loud enough.  For God's sake, they're embarrassing. 
[02:14:00]  I wish we were on TV because you've got to see the looks that the people are giving these  two all around us.  Hundreds of people.  Oh, yes.  You know what the good thing is, though?  Oh, my God.  Are they singing?  I'm singing Cisco Kid by war because they see Cisco is coming.  Oh, you see the Cisco?  Oh, it's probably not Cisco.  I'm going to start singing their songs.  You know what?  You know what's up?  Hey, ladies, you got the thorns on or what?  Cisco's a friend of mine.  Let's not shake the asses too much, ladies, okay? 
[02:14:30]  Just calm down a little bit.  You know what's great?  The way the cameras are positioned over here.  I think when J.Lo walks by, a lot of the cameras pan over that way.  And I think you might see on a lot of the newscasts or whatnot, you might see Lady Diane  Marion harassing some of these people.  I hope some of this makes TV.  Yeah.  Who is she saying hi to?  I said hi to my brother.  Bobby, her brother.  My brother, Bobby.  He's listening to the show. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, I thought he was walking down the carpet or something.  Oh, this is going to suck that we have to go off the air.  I know.  We're going to have the rest of this tomorrow on the show.  I just noticed, though, a publicist or something talked to one of them TV people and pointed  over towards them.  So I don't know if they're on to us.  On to us?  We're just there.  They're able to conduct interviews.  Retarded interviews.  There's nothing to be on to.  We're playing by the rules here.  Yeah.  We're in our compound, and we're letting the retarded Laverne and Shirley ask the questions. 
[02:15:30]  Unfortunately, it's taken so long for these people to walk by.  Ponderous.  But, yeah, we'll tape everything.  Okay.  You're trying to keep the crowd in order, right?  Edit out the dead spots.  Okay.  And get the magic that is the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Ladies, ladies, ladies, get ready.  Okay.  All right.  We got some people right to our...  Oh, people are coming over?  Yep.  All right.  I wonder who they can be. 
[02:16:00]  We got any line on who they are?  No.  Oh, what's our boss writing?  What's he writing?  Hey, Paul, who are those guys?  Do you know?  Who's down there?  What's Jeremy writing?  It's Eve.  Stop and drop your equipment and run away.  What's going on?  Jeremy's writing a programming note.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe one of the MTV people came up to him.  Instructed him to tell us to shut up or something. 
[02:16:30]  You think it's who?  City High?  Who?  Which of men are not home, but this is life.  I don't know.  It's, like, really gay.  Well, that helped us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, ladies, ask who that is right there.  Right there.  He's on Star Trek, The Next Generation.  Hi, who are you?  That's LeVar Burton.  That's Jay-Z.  Hey, Jay-Z.  Bobby.  Bobby Ratt?  That's not Bobby Ratt. 
[02:17:00]  I can't take it.  Hey, Jay-Z.  They're calling.  Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.  Come here.  I want to ask a question.  That's Cisco, Marion.  Cisco, same thing.  That's Cisco.  No, it's not Jay-Z.  That's Cisco.  That's not Jay-Z.  And the publicist is really true.  We don't do well with publicist.  You know, I'm not about MTV.  I told you.  They're right to our right now.  They will be coming right by.  By us in a matter of moments.  And they will be blowing us off, guaranteed.  But let's see what happens.  Is the publicist just going to run block on this? 
[02:17:30]  She's completely running block.  She hates us.  She hates us.  She has no sense of humor.  She's a zero.  Look at her.  Are you talking about Marion?  Oh, the publicist.  Publicist.  My selfish.  This is called having fun.  Look at her.  Look at her.  Look at the attitude she's giving us.  Uh-uh.  Talk to the hand, baby.  She's backing that ass up.  She's backing that ass up right into Marion's face.  She has nice cheeks.  Watch this.  What are you going to do?  Don't do anything.  I'm not going to do anything, but watch.  Watch the blow-off.  Watch the blow-off.  She's running block. 
[02:18:00]  You can tell the way she's positioned.  When they move, she's not going to allow them to come over here.  She's definitely sitting there.  But that's where Lady Di and Marion have to get aggressive.  They're part of the paparazzi now.  Hey, Jay-Z.  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.  That's Cisco.  That's Cisco.  That's Cisco.  What did I tell you?  It's not Jay-Z and it's not Cisco.  I have to run away.  Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.  I have to run away.  Hey, Cisco.  Can we interview you?  That's who?  It's not Cisco.  City High.  Dude, there are people freaking out across the way going, that is not Cisco.  Hey, City High. 
[02:18:30]  They're telling you it's not Cisco.  What?  Huh?  Oh, my God.  ONA.  O.B. and Anthony.  Don't throw our names around.  You're cool people.  How are you doing, Cisco?  I'm going to throw our names around.  See, the funny thing is, this guy's getting pissed across the red carpet.  Yeah.  Because he thinks this is all it's true.  Hey, yo, Jay-Z.  No, this is real.  Look at the publicist blocking.  The publicist is completely blocking.  The publicist will not let us talk to these guys whatsoever.  Excuse me.  What's your outfit?  Excuse me.  Let's go. 
[02:19:00]  Looks like they don't want to have fun.  See that blow up?  They totally blew us off.  That was a blow up.  Oh, my God.  We only have a couple minutes left in the show.  God damn.  These people took too long to get down this runway.  Well, we're going to continue, and then we'll play the audio on the show tomorrow.  So, Stinky, who's back at the station, when you have to end the show, just end it.  And hit the tape.  You guys got about three minutes.  Three minutes left.  That was a major blow off. 
[02:19:30]  I hate people that don't get it.  If this doesn't get taped for tomorrow, somebody dies.  Well, how would you feel if someone was yelling,  Hey, hey, get Trent Resnick.  It's Anthony Kiedis.  How are you, Tattoo Man?  How are you doing?  How are you doing over there?  All right, enough with the tattoo name.  Please.  Oh, hey, who's up on the platform up there?  Is that Brittany's back?  Yeah, come here.  Tell me to come over here.  Manson!  Shut up, stupid.  How are you?  Hey, Manson! 
[02:20:00]  Hi!  How's everything?  That's not Manson.  Marilyn Manson.  That's not Marilyn Manson.  Come here.  It's Marilyn Manson.  That's not Marilyn Manson.  You're an idiot.  How are you going to be by Marilyn?  You look like my next-door neighbor used to look like that.  You are a tool.  Marilyn Manson, I love all your music.  No, you don't.  Why is there a lot of people pointing at us now?  I know.  No, it's just like the freak show.  Who is the blonde up on the platform?  Do you recognize her?  I can't tell.  It's her back.  They're primping her. 
[02:20:30]  It could be Mandy Moore.  It could be Jennifer Sisson.  It could be Britney Spears.  From the back, you can't tell.  Hey, Marilyn Manson.  Hey, do you want to answer something?  No, it's not.  That's not very nice.  I don't want to see your music no more.  Your music's pink.  Hey, hey, hey.  Marion.  Marion.  Sit down.  She's getting pissed off now.  They're going to end the show in a couple minutes.  You're probably less than a minute.  So we're going to continue. 
[02:21:00]  The audio's going to be on the show tomorrow.  We're going to have Mario Cantone on the show as well tomorrow.  It's going to be a really good show.  Hi, you too.  Hi, Sal.  Nice to meet you, too.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Good, good.  Cool.  I'm from Whitestone.  Oh, hi.  We're from New Jersey.  We're from Jersey.  Yeah, giving Jersey just a great reputation, these two, aren't they?  There's a lot of nuts to live in New York and New Jersey.  You're living on garbage.  No.  Of course you live on garbage.  We don't live on garbage.  No, New Jersey's not just garbage.  No, because you know why?  What a way to end our broadcast outside of PMA. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, we barely got to have them interview any real celebrities.  Who's that chick?  Oh, that's the same people that came right before.  Hey, Cisco.  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  No, no, it's not Cisco.  We told you to call Cisco.  He's grown.  He's waving at him.  I like the outfit.  Come here.  Come on.  Party.  They ran away again.  It's not Cisco, you idiot.  It's the same publicists just getting madder and madder and madder.  The guy that's calling Cisco is like pointing at him and laughing at their faces. 
[02:22:00]  Man.  Not a lot of people around here that have a sense of humor, huh, Norton?  No, just the biggest horse's asses I've ever seen.  They're just really bad.  Hey, Ben, are we off the air?  We don't even know.  Who knows?  I'll find out.  If we're not off the air, we're going off the air, okay?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Outside the VMAs.  And we're going to continue here.  Yeah.  And we'll play back the audio tomorrow on the show, okay?  Cool.  All right.  Thanks for listening.  It's Opie and Anthony live from the red carpet. 
[02:22:30]  Okay, that's a little unusual, but okay, well, tell me.  Broadcasting live from the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards at Lincoln Center in New York City.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
