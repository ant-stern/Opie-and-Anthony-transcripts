<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with comedian Bill Burr filling in for Jim Norton.  A significant portion was dedicated to Anthony's contentious divorce, detailing his ex-wife's seemingly unreasonable demands, particularly concerning household chores, and her later claims of contributing to his success.  Anecdotes about their life together, from their early struggling days in radio to the present, were shared.  The hosts then recounted their experiences at Mardi Gras in New Orleans, describing it as frightening and detailing incidents of public indecency and violence.  They reminisced about their excessive drinking and partying during the show's peak, mentioning shot girls, a Jägermeister machine, and the significant control they wielded due to high ratings.  Their attendance at a Rolling Stones concert the previous night was discussed, including a VIP party for XM Satellite Radio salespeople, and a comparison of Mick Jagger and James Hetfield’s stage presence.  A Stephen Lynch song was played, and "The War of the Kumias" segment was mentioned.

The show continued with a detailed account of the Rolling Stones concert, including the lengthy intermission between Alanis Morissette (who played to a sparse crowd) and the Rolling Stones, and observations about the band members' performances and personalities, particularly Ron Wood's family life.  The massive stage production was also described.  This transitioned into a heated argument regarding Eric Nagel, a show employee, winning $100,000 in a Daily News scratch-off lottery. The focus shifted to the hosts and staff allegedly abandoning Eric in the Meadowlands parking lot after the concert.  Accusations of negligence and intentional ditching were exchanged, with Eric detailing his struggles to get home, including encounters with "Stalker Patty."  Listener calls mostly sided with the hosts, leaving the argument unresolved.

Further conflict arose between Opie and Eric, revolving around Eric's perceived ingratitude for Opie's role in his career and a dispute over the legitimacy of Eric’s winning lottery ticket, which seemingly came from station promotional materials.  The argument escalated to threats of legal action, ultimately settling on a symbolic lunch.  Calls from Manny and Travis offered conflicting accounts of the ticket incident. Stalker Patty called in, describing her gambling habits and surprisingly uneventful encounters with Eric.  The show then arranged a date between Stalker Patty and Big A, a taxi driver, with a staff member as chaperone, planning to document it at Paisano's during the San Gennaro Feast. Opie concluded this segment with a story about being scammed at a similar game at the San Gennaro Feast.

A Paisano's restaurant promotion followed, featuring Dane Cook as a guest in the studio.  A phone call with Jim Norton, detailing his disastrous trip to Los Angeles (roach-infested apartment, unpleasant encounter with a woman) and anxieties about his flight on a financially troubled Northwest Airlines, was included.  Dane Cook and Bill Burr shared humorous stand-up experiences, recounting disastrous gigs and dealing with difficult audiences. Cook described a surreal MTV Video Music Awards appearance. Listener-submitted remixes of Bob Kelly’s knee injury audio became a recurring comedic element.  An irate listener called in, engaging in a heated exchange with the hosts.

A hostile phone call with a listener, "Dragon Wagon," featuring vulgar insults and crude remarks, was followed by a studio segment with Bill Burr promoting his HBO special. Dane Cook discussed his Madison Square Garden show and shared more stories of difficult gigs, often using offensive language and racial slurs in his retellings. Bob Kelly called in with stories about his gigs, including one involving defecation (either on a tour bus or in a wastebasket, depending on the account).  The hosts played a clip of Martha Stewart rapping with P. Diddy, commenting on its awkwardness using offensive language, and concluded with a brief discussion of Dane Cook's tour dates.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  I am scared of you, sir, and I am protecting myself.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police.  Hello, exactly.  Come on, everybody.  Wake up.  Rise and shine.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  Arrgh.  ONA party run.  Arrgh.  ONA party run.  ONA party run.  ONA party run. 
[00:05:00]  ONA party run.  ONA party run.  ONA party rock.  Indeed.  Indeed, sir.  Hey, what's happening?  What's happening?  Hi.  Ooh, who's the chicken chase?  What?  I don't know.  Front page news then.  Is that Lil' Kemp?  I thought you were supposed to go to jail.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  All the disasters are over, I guess.  Everything's fine in New Orleans again, I guess?  Yeah, pretty much.  All the water's pumped out.  Everybody's back home.  Everyone's back to work.  The economy's great.  Back to school.  Because the cover of the papers, I see nothing about it.  I see Yankees back on there.  Oh, wait, Newsday.  Okay, Newsday has it.  City will rise again.  Yeah.  The great Phoenix, that is New Orleans. 
[00:06:00]  Phoenix?  You know, I ripped out a couple great stories, and I forgot to bring them in here.  Oops.  Travis, if you will.  Thank you, sir.  New Orleans is one of the scariest cities I've ever been to.  That's what we said.  Absolutely.  We went to two Mardi Gras, and I would walk around in the morning, get coffee and stuff,  you know, before it got wild, and I was scared.  Did you feel like when you were on Bourbon Street at night that, okay, this is cool as  long as I stay on this street, but if I literally go ten feet to the left or to the right, someone's  going to have a chicken foot up to my neck, a little fucking voodoo doll. 
[00:06:30]  That's the only place I've ever seen, I mean, even living here in New York, just saw a dude  expose himself.  Yeah.  We were standing underneath one of those show-your-tits balconies.  Balconies, yeah.  Another great thing about New Orleans that was almost washed away in the tragedy.  And I look over, and there was literally a guy who had, like, his shirt tails, like,  pulled out of his pants, but I was to the side, and he was like,  he was fat, so kind of pushed out, and he had his whole unit, his dick and balls, were  just out.  Just hanging out. 
[00:07:00]  And I looked, I was horrified.  It took me, like, half a second before I could stand.  He's got his dick!  And the dude literally, calm as can be, like, a totally professional pervert, just kind of  slipped back into the crowd, and you're like, no, no, what was it?  Silence of the Lambs?  Oh, yeah.  He's going home, and he kind of, like, goes into the living room.  That's exactly what he did.  He just disappeared.  Not even putting his dick back in his pants, he just slipped back into his pants.  That city is frightening, man.  Yeah, it definitely is.  Unless you stay, even when you do stay on Bourbon Street, it's frightening. 
[00:07:30]  But then you go into the little outskirt areas where, you know, Ben, Ben was with us, and  he's like, no, dude, I know this nice restaurant, I know what we're here.  And we start walking, and you notice the crowds thinning a little bit, and now you're seeing  some of the locals, the people that aren't, you know, from out of town, looking around  like, oh, this isn't good.  You're leaving the herd.  Yeah, leaving the herd.  That's what you're doing.  You're grazing to the side.  And the side streets are trying to keep Mardi Gras going, but it's a whole different thing.  The zebra in the middle of the herd is never the one that gets the teeth sunk into his 
[00:08:00]  neck.  Oh, exactly.  It's always the ones that are on the outskirts.  The one that doesn't leave with the herd because he wants to drink a little more water at the  watering hole.  The ones that consider themselves free spirits.  Right.  You've got to check all the things out.  They're all great.  Yeah, there's a flyer laying on the jungle floor.  Hey, after party.  After party.  Yeah, we just saw a gang of black kids just beating the shit out of white people as they  walked by.  Yeah.  That was it.  White people who walked by. 
[00:08:30]  Black people walked by them, and they wouldn't even look at them.  I think that's part of their town logo.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  I'm just grabbing by the throat and punching the face of a white person.  White people would walk by, a guy and a girl, and the guy would be punched, and the girl  would just be molested, groped right there.  They would finally get pulled out of the crowd, and they'd be laughing their asses off.  We're watching from a balcony across the street, watching the entire thing.  It was like watching Wild Kingdom or something. 
[00:09:00]  That one year, the Puerto Rican Day Parade was our tribute to New Orleans.  Yeah.  Great job.  You should have got sued.  And then the cops came over and busted him up and dragged a couple of them away.  And that was cool.  And then we spoke up.  Then we're like, yeah, motherfucker!  You're busted!  They're throwing them in cars.  Beforehand, we're just looking up.  Whitey showing how brave we are.  Here comes another white couple.  Oh, this is going to be bad.  Oh, no.  Just kind of commenting on it but doing nothing. 
[00:09:30]  Because we're pussies.  So I guess it's all cleaned up down there because the papers are moving on to bigger and better things.  Like Renee Zellweger.  Her marriage is over after five months.  Big surprise there, everybody.  Oh, is that true?  Renee just walks away.  Annulment in works for Zellweger and that country singer she married out of nowhere.  Oh, right.  What the hell is his name?  Kenny Chesney.  Kenny Chesney. 
[00:10:00]  They hooked up.  I guess they met at some tsunami thing.  Yeah.  I've been to a concert.  That's when they hooked up.  They dated for a very short time and then decided to get married.  And it was, you know, she was, he was her prince and he wrote a song about her based on her character.  What movie was that?  Jerry Maguire.  That's like, you had me at hello.  It's like one notch below getting the tattoo of your girlfriend. 
[00:10:30]  Just writing some sappy fucking song that'll never go away.  Some ass song that like, it was a hit of his, I guess.  I never heard it.  Like J-Lo did that deer bend.  You know, she cringes.  Oh, yeah.  That CD is not in any of her mansions.  Because it's immortalized, you know?  It's out there.  It's done.  You did it.  And no matter how much you hate the person now, that song is out there.  Professing your love.  They have a kid someday.  Who's Ben? 
[00:11:00]  That's about London.  I was talking about that clock.  It's a producer with wild hair on the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, he herked and he jerked.  So that's over.  But that's the front page of the New York Daily News.  Called it quits.  She filed and all it says, divorce papers are very vague all the time.  And I guess in California you have a lot of options as to what you can base your divorce on. 
[00:11:30]  In New York, you really only have cruel and inhuman treatment and infidelity is the other one.  And there's like, there might be one more, but I don't know.  The other one is lack of sex.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there is.  Oh, really?  That was a joke.  Yeah, lack of sex or something.  That was a joke.  They call it something else.  But if you haven't had sex for like a year, you can get a divorce. 
[00:12:00]  If you're separated, legally separated for a year, then you can get a divorce without one of those wacky things put in there.  But if you want a divorce quickly, you have to come up with an idea with some kind of one of these three things that New York allows.  No irreconcilable?  No, they don't have irreconcilable differences in New York.  That's the one I was gunning for.  I had to go for a cruel and inhuman treatment or something.  Well, I could have been a star witness for you.  But it was the other way around. 
[00:12:30]  I was being treated cruelly and inhumanly.  But that wasn't what happened.  I would have been on your side.  Don't worry about it.  That wasn't what happened.  I was the one that was served the papers that said that.  That you were treating her bad?  Yes!  I'm sorry.  The money I gave you wasn't clean enough, perhaps.  The dates on it weren't the numbers she enjoyed.  All I remember.  What can I say?  How cruel could I have been?  All I remember is pulling up to Anthony's house.  We used to commute back then.  It would be like 9.15 in the morning. 
[00:13:00]  And Anthony sleeps right up until I'm pulling up.  I know that about him, right?  And he's at the front door.  And his wife is just yelling at him.  Yeah, as I was walking out the door.  Yelling at him at 9.15.  And I know it might have woke up at 9.  I'm serious.  So he gets in the car.  I'm like, what could you have possibly done?  The garbage, Opie.  The garbage.  What do you mean the garbage?  It's my job.  And I didn't do it.  Like Anthony had jobs.  I had jobs around the house.  Like the garbage was my job. 
[00:13:30]  You know when you're a kid and you have chores?  Like you've got to mow the lawn and take out the garbage.  The cat box was my job.  Was that like a first serious relationship for you?  Because it didn't seem like you.  You didn't set up the guidelines correctly.  No, I fucking dropped the ball on the guidelines, man.  What happens, man?  You have to flip out.  I didn't.  I really fucked up.  I didn't set the bar early.  If you don't break a couple of dishes or punch a wall within the first six weeks, you're done.  No.  I cruised nine years. 
[00:14:00]  Nine years of OK Sweetie.  That was it.  Nine years of OK Sweetie.  And that was it.  And Opie would pull up.  I'd leave the house to, you know.  And, you know, I asked you to do the goddamn garbage.  And it's sitting here.  All right.  All right.  Well, Opie's here.  I've got to go do my show.  This is the behind the scenes of a guy that was becoming a radio rock star.  We were becoming radio rock stars. 
[00:14:30]  And people had no idea what was going on behind the scenes.  No clue.  He's getting yelled at.  I remember what.  What, what, what?  I was going to say, I thought you guys were doing OK.  But just the beginning of you pulling up to pick him up, just that visual didn't have you guys making a lot of money in my brain right now.  No.  We did have that Fred and Barney type relationship with the driving to work.  But once we got in, it was kind of.  Honestly, we were doing afternoon drive.  We were doing good.  We were commuting from Long Island.  And now even, you know, off hours, it was a pain in the ass.  So we took turns is what it was. 
[00:15:00]  So one guy can mellow out and, you know, in the past, you can see, read the papers and do whatever.  So we would take turns.  And we lived, yeah.  We lived really close to each other.  We lived about a half a mile from each other.  Oh, OK.  But I would pull up and they were.  You know, I don't ask much.  There's another one.  I don't ask much.  It's the garbage, the cat box.  You got to get.  I was.  I got cat box duty.  This is.  Now, this is from a guy.  I don't want cats.  Don't get me wrong.  I like cats.  I think kittens are probably the cutest little things on the face of the earth. 
[00:15:30]  They're big faces, the eyes, the head too big for the little kitten bodies.  Their poop doesn't smell as bad.  No, it doesn't.  And it's not as bad as a grown cat.  Yeah.  She's gone to McDonald's for 20 years.  She got a cat.  So now it's my cat.  Then she wants to get another cat for the cat to have company.  So she gets another cat, a female cat.  Neither of the two are fixed.  What do you think is going to happen?  So now we have a whole litter of cats that have to be given away. 
[00:16:00]  We give away cats except for two.  Now we have four cats.  She's turning into crazy cat lady.  Four cats in this house.  And I get cat box detail.  It's like.  Oh, my God.  We had chores.  It's a twice a day like thing to do because I don't like walking into a house and it's smelling  like cat shit.  It was just a nightmare.  It's funny.  If I literally saw that, I could never go into the house.  Of course not. 
[00:16:30]  I had a buddy of mine one time.  He was with this girl and I went over there.  I was just staying, you know, for a couple of days.  You know, we have company.  You kind of try to, you know, there was some huge fucking game on like Lakers Celtics.  This is a few years, a huge fucking game.  And she huffed and puffed.  And next thing we're watching like fucking Little House on the Prairie or something.  Oh, Jesus.  And she's just sitting and I'm looking at him and I'm just waiting for her to go to  the bathroom.  I had one of those really like, like loud whispering.  Dude, you can't fucking.  This is fucking bullshit. 
[00:17:00]  Fucking Lakers Celtics.  It's game seven.  What's wrong with you?  And then she comes back up.  Hey, Marie.  How you doing?  And I'm looking and I'm like, have the confrontation.  Do it.  Hello.  I'm going to go outside and start smoking.  I've never done that before.  I'll be back in, I'll give you seven minutes to fucking correct this, you idiot.  Oh, great.  I went out and bought a couch.  Bought a nice couch.  Actually, the first, I think, nice thing I ever bought.  Because we had come from Massachusetts.  I was living in Ashland, Mass. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, I know.  This is the worst fucking story I've ever heard.  Shit hole.  Well, yeah, we moved up because I got the gig with Opie.  It was my first radio job.  I was in construction.  I didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, as my mother always would say.  And we move up to Ashland, Mass.  Opie gets a house in Newton, and I moved to Ashland.  Where are you in Newton?  Wellesley.  Wellesley.  All right.  Sorry.  I wasn't making that much more than him at the time. 
[00:18:00]  He was, we were still, we were still.  Don't all those houses have like ivy growing up the sides of them?  Oh, please.  Believe it or not, they have shit holes in Wellesley.  It's where, Newton and Wellesley is where Mass herds all their Jews.  All their Jews are there.  That's the area.  I just want to live as close to Boston as possible, because, you know, the radio station was way out in the suburbs.  The radio station, I lived like a mile away from the station.  I didn't want to live in Boston, because that wasn't where the station was.  They made it sound like they were in Boston, W-A-A-F, Boston.  And they're out in friggin' Westboro. 
[00:18:30]  It was nowhere, an industrial park.  And so I lived, first of all, I had to go with the wife and live with her mother for a while in her condo.  Oh, my God.  With Opie.  So it's me, Opie, my wife, and my mother-in-law in this small little townhouse.  And we were on a rocket ship to becoming radio.  Rocketing to stardom.  To become radio rock stars, but no one knew what the hell was going on behind the scenes. 
[00:19:00]  So we figured, thank God, you know, mothers and daughters have a hard time living together for any length of time.  So we got a place really quickly.  But we got a place.  It was garden apartments in Ashland, Mass., with, like, I was the only white person living there.  It was all Brazilians and, like, other people from South America, Ecuador, I swear to you.  Columbians.  Columbians, everything.  The parking lot had these potholes in it that were huge. 
[00:19:30]  And when it rained, the children would go out in their diapers and stuff and bathe and, like, use it like a pool.  There were chickens.  One guy chicken-wired off his balcony, off the apartment.  But it wasn't his balcony.  Yeah.  It was shared space.  You know, in apartments you have shared space in the back there?  He had a balcony, like the little wrought iron patio.  That was his.  Because it was a ground floor.  It wasn't a balcony. 
[00:20:00]  It was a wrought iron patio.  But he chicken-wired off, like, a whole area around that and just filled it with chickens.  There were chickens in this garden.  And I'm living there.  I'm living there.  And I know you didn't say shit to some Columbian.  Of course I didn't.  Chicken-wired.  Did he go out and slaughter them right in front of you for his evening dinner?  A couple of times there would be a few missing and then there were new ones.  So you knew he was just slitting their throat and bringing it in.  You heard a disturbance.  Yeah.  Little disturbance.  Feathers flow by your fucking window. 
[00:20:30]  But that's what we were doing.  We were living there.  And it was a mile away from the mother's house and a couple of miles away from the station.  And it was all, you know, it was all my wife's doing.  Like, what she said, that's what I did because I was just coasting through life.  I was constantly waiting for something better but doing really nothing to try to get it.  Like, the whole radio thing.  I would have been in Huntington, New York, a tin knocker, installing air conditioning and heating, and just doing that. 
[00:21:00]  Hoping something came along.  And you know what?  Something just happened to drop in my lap.  Hello.  Radio.  It was just complete luck of the draw that it happened.  But I still would have been there.  That's so frightening.  And then the whole thing that happened with the apartment out there is she got that one.  And I was like, yeah, fine.  I'll live with the Columbians in Ashland.  A mile away from your mother's house.  Were you just trying to save money?  We weren't making a lot.  I really wasn't making a lot.  And nothing, you know, obviously, I was brand new. 
[00:21:30]  It was my first radio gig.  Opie's been in it for years at this point.  So, obviously, he was getting paid more than I was.  They weren't even sure I was going to work out.  You know, it was one of those things.  I thought I'd be back tin knocking again.  I thought it would be a goof to do radio for a while.  So, Opie was making more than me.  I was making, at that time, less.  I got hired to do radio for less than I was making in construction.  So, yeah, I had no money.  So, was your wife just trashing this dream every day?  Yeah, actually, she almost didn't have me do it.  She almost fucked up the whole thing. 
[00:22:00]  Because she wanted me to call now.  Now, the GM to the WAF throws out an offer.  And it is for less money than I was making.  I think I was making $29,000 a year doing construction.  This is a 95.  Removing asbestos.  Yeah, exactly.  And he was offering me $25,000 to do radio.  Now, I'm like, fine.  I'll take the hit.  Because I don't know what's going to happen.  And Bruce, he said to us, boys, if it works out in a few months, don't worry, Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  We'll bring you up.  And we both took the hit, by the way.  I wasn't making much more than Anthony.  No.  After many years in radio.  Just to sit here and shoot the shit.  Right.  Or fucking install air conditioners.  Exactly.  And I said to Anthony, I'm like, this is a star.  Trust me on this.  We'll get more money.  You know, we just got to establish ourselves.  And she could work.  It was like, you know.  Right.  She'd go out and get a job, which she did.  And I explained, too, we'll make some side money, possibly, with gigs and stuff.  Yeah.  Whatever.  So I was like, don't worry about it.  You'll get it.  So I go, uh, uh, schnookums. 
[00:23:00]  I, uh, I got the offer.  Big dream to do radio when I go to Boston.  How much?  Uh, it was all about the money.  Well, was your hat in your hand?  Yes.  I was crinkling my hat in my handle, nervously working it in front of them.  It's like, uh, well, it's $25,000 a year.  But, but, the B-U came out for but.  Nope.  Can't do it.  We cannot do that. 
[00:23:30]  It just doesn't work out.  Uh, call him and tell him you can't do it for less than, uh, what you were making.  Yes, Poopsie.  Uh, and there I am on the phone with Brucey Mittman.  Uh, Bruce, yeah, look great.  We had a great time.  Uh, but, look, I'm going to need a little more money, uh, for this.  I just can't move up.  I'd say I'd do it.  And she's, like, right next to me.  Exactly what you want.  Thank God so much.  She was the worst when it came to this.  She had no, no bargaining position there whatsoever.  Yeah.  She had no clue of the upside. 
[00:24:00]  It was either staying, you know, uh, installing air conditioners.  Yeah.  Or go into radio with the potential to make ridiculous money.  Yeah.  She just never saw it that way.  How many superstars?  Both men and women.  Just in a bad relationship.  People who, like, win an Oscar.  Yeah.  I like fucking, you know, seating people at, like, an Applebee's.  Yep.  Just because.  Yeah, just because.  No.  No.  You're not doing that part.  No.  You're not doing it.  We can't afford it.  Acting is silly.  Yeah.  And you're going to get a real job.  There's Grammy-winning singers and fucking people that are just talented up the ass. 
[00:24:30]  Working at Dunkin' Donuts.  Yep.  Eking it out.  Oh, my God.  No, I remember, like, when I was thinking about doing stand-up, I didn't have the balls  to even think I could do, because I didn't know anybody in entertainment.  And you literally, I'm working in this warehouse, and I'm, you know, to just sit there and say,  I want to be a comedian.  I'm just thinking of the trashing that I would get for you.  Right, right.  Take a fucking warehouse pallet over my head.  And so I'm not going to say anything.  Hey, the guy wants to be a comedian.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:00]  He's going to load the truck, you douchebag.  Hey, funny man.  The only thing funny about you is the electric.  So it just so happened, I was working with this guy who was really into comedy.  One night we were hanging out after work.  Remember that show, Stand-Up Spotlight?  Yeah.  With Rosie O'Donnell, right at the end of that 80s.  Was that the one with the brick wall?  That was the one that actually, no, this one actually had, like, the little Christmas lights  in the background to be stars.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Because all these hacks were on their way, right?  And we were just watching, and he just happened to say to me, he goes, look at these guys, 
[00:25:30]  Bill.  These guys suck.  We're funnier than these guys.  You know, one of these days I'm going to take a shot at Jack Daniels, and I'm going to  fucking get up there.  And the second he said that, all of a sudden I was like, it just kind of put me on that track.  Like, fuck, I want to do that.  But I swear to God, if I never had that conversation with him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd be, like, driving a fucking UPS truck.  Yeah.  For real.  Unlike the Kevin James character.  Yeah.  For real.  Yeah.  $700 million.  It's just...  So how did we get to this point?  You get... 
[00:26:00]  I don't know.  Oh, but wait, wait, wait.  Quickly, Bruce came back to me and said, I could give you $27.5, but that's it.  And, you know, I was like, I got to take this.  So, boy, I really put my foot down there and said, yeah, $27.5.  Don't worry, it'll all work.  Opie said that more money will come in and everything.  So finally...  Was I right?  Was I right?  Of course you were right.  Thank you.  And then the real kicker, fast forward nine years later in court, to have Dominic Barbara 
[00:26:30]  telling me how integral a part she played in me getting to where I am in radio and how  she deserves so much money.  Did they throw out the support word?  Oh, everything.  Yeah, yeah.  The support.  You know, it pretty much was, if it wasn't for her, I would not be in radio.  Meanwhile, you know, I almost didn't end up in radio.  Because she didn't see the dream, the vision.  Yeah, the vision.  That's how it works out. 
[00:27:00]  That's the wonder of marriage.  At times, she was definitely a hindrance.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Because Anthony was miserable.  Oh!  Because he was getting yelled at.  Like, I can't stress.  I mean, we were on a rocket ship.  We were going into the city to do this radio show that was exploding.  We were doing magazine articles.  We were going to be on TV doing this.  I mean, things were really rocking for us.  Yeah.  And he's getting yelled at because from 9 to 9.15, he didn't, like, vacuum and...  Vacuuming was my job, too.  And clean out the litter box. 
[00:27:30]  Jesus Christ.  There was...  Yeah.  You know, fast forward six hours later in that day, and the world is ours.  But at home, it was a nightmare.  That kind of worked out for me, though, because when I was there at the station, it was such  a good time for me.  Like, I was away and having so much fun.  I never went home.  I swear to you.  I would go...  We were talking about...  I would start drinking at noon.  Get back in here.  We were talking about this last night because we went to the Rolling Stones. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  We'll get into that in a little while here.  But XM threw a whole party for their salespeople from all over the country.  Uh-huh.  So I went because I wanted to check out the Stones.  You decided not to go last night.  Ben was there, Steve, Eric, and others, and it was a schmooze fest.  Yeah.  And everyone's asking, where's Anthony?  Of course they are.  I'm like, Anthony's home, whatever.  He doesn't do this type of thing anymore.  I actually had plans.  I wanted to go.  Right.  I was actually out last night.  But then we were telling Lindsay, actually, the old Anthony.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  About the old Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  Because she only knows the new Anthony.  I'm like, you have no idea.  The old Anthony would be at that bar.  Not only drinking a beer, it would be a beer shot, beer shot, beer shot, beer shot, smoke,  smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  Beer shot, beer shot, beer shot, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.  Like, he's a completely different person.  I like my captains and Cokes.  That's what I really enjoy.  And then other people started coming around, and Ben and I were explaining the old Anthony.  Like, Anthony would start.  He wouldn't drink the first hour of the show.  Like, from 3 to 4, he wouldn't drink.  But from 4 to 7 in the afternoon, forget about it. 
[00:29:00]  Pounding.  Because.  Pounding beers.  The beer sponsors would send over pallets of beer to the studio.  They set us up with refrigerators just outside the studio that were packed with beer.  Sam Adams, Budweiser, Coors, all of them came on board, and all of them sent beer.  Dude, we were a radio company's dream.  We had every beer company wanted on our show.  Yeah.  And we used to have two fridges.  We had a fridge for food and a fridge for beer.  And then the fridge for food got filled up with beer as well. 
[00:29:30]  So now we had two fridges with beer in them.  Then the other companies would start bringing their own fridges in because they noticed.  Like, Sobe beverages brought in this big double door thing you see in a deli.  You know, where you open it up and pull your sodas out and stuff.  It was giant.  That thing ended up full of beer.  Full of beer.  And then the beer guys would come in with almost a pallet of beer.  Well, like small pallets, an exaggeration, but a lot of beer.  And they would come in right into our office.  Where you guys want this. 
[00:30:00]  And they would notice that they couldn't keep their beer cold, which means we might not  drink it on the air, which means we might not give the extra push to that beer.  Yeah.  So they would bring it in their own fridges.  At the end, I think we had four fridges in the office.  We would get 12 cases of Budweiser one week, 12 cases of Sam the next week.  Then Coors was like six cases.  So it was ridiculous.  Sounds like the Motley Crue, like the beginning of their behind the music.  It absolutely is.  We have a lot of interest in a book, and I think we're finally going to go down that  road.  Oh, yeah.  And then the Jägermeister machine showed up. 
[00:30:30]  Jäger.  We were talking about Jäger, and the people from Jägermeister come up, and they bring  one of those machines that deep freezes shots of Jägermeister.  It's a big refrigerator.  So you hit the tap, put the shock glass underneath, and you get a shot of Jäger that's at like  33 degrees.  Just above freezing.  So now we're doing frozen Jäger shots.  This is while we're working.  This was on the air early.  Nobody stepped in in upper management like, hey.  No, they were afraid of us. 
[00:31:00]  No, why?  The ratings were going up, up, up, up, so they were just keeping their mouths shut.  It's like whatever.  Here's what the deal was.  The rest of the station was tanking so badly that we were the only show that was keeping  these people their jobs.  Like, you can't be the general manager, program director of a station that's consistently  in the shitter.  They blow you out and bring someone else in and try to get it up to speed.  Look at what they've done at N.E.W. since we were gone.  They've been through so many people there, so many bosses, because that's what you do.  They knew that without our ratings, their jobs were done. 
[00:31:30]  So they were petrified to shake us up or rock the boat.  We hired a bartender.  We hired a bartender to come in.  We had shot girls.  We had girls with the test tubes and the shots walking around on Fridays.  And the boss is there.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  It got to the point.  There were so many people around when we were doing our show, we didn't know half of them.  It was a bullet train heading toward a concrete wall. 
[00:32:00]  They were drinking our beer, doing our shots.  We didn't care.  We just didn't care.  Anthony, how many beers a day were you drinking?  Let's say.  We'd start an hour after the show started, me and Ben.  Four to seven.  We'd start drinking.  By seven o'clock, I'd probably finished off about eight beers.  And then we'd hit the office, because I didn't want to go home.  We'd hit the office where I would play video games, drink more.  And then the second Opie left the office, it would turn into a fog machine. 
[00:32:30]  The whole me, stinky, everyone would light up and just smoke beers, shots, and computer  games until 10 o'clock at night when I would finally call up and go, yeah, all the meetings  are over.  I'm coming home.  And then I'd get in my car, and just depression would sink in as I was on the LIE going, oh,  no, I'm heading home.  Oh, no.  Oh, fuck.  This is, oh, boy.  This is day in and day out.  And then I'd get home, the garbage is full, the this, the the, the cat box, the, go up 
[00:33:00]  and feed the cats.  You would do Ron and Fez's show, too, because of that.  Oh, right.  Ron and Fez come on after us.  And I would just sit in on their show.  I would be like, yeah, I'm going to hang out.  And it was the Ron, Fez, and Anthony show.  He was the third member of the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they just didn't want to go home.  Back then, they were on 11 o'clock at night in the beginning.  Yeah.  They did it before they moved to 7 to 11.  So, yeah.  So, yesterday, being at the Rolling Stones thing, it was kind of funny that Anthony wasn't 
[00:33:30]  there.  And, you know, we joke about how he just goes home after the show and doesn't do much anymore  because it's not the same Anthony we know.  That's right.  So, I don't know where, I don't know how we got to this point.  I think it was the Renee Zellweger marriage thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Somehow that spilled into this.  Anytime anyone talks about marriage, I just get it in my head.  It's like, never again.  Yeah, but you know what's funny about that is if you actually told that on TV, you would  be considered, like, women bashing. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because I was sitting there listening to that.  That was why that was so fascinating to listen to that story because you always hear the other  ones.  Yeah.  Like the women going, and then he beat me, and then he did this, and blah, blah, blah, blah.  I was a prisoner.  Yeah, and Oprah and all of them will listen to that because they're just like, just obviously  you see a man is stronger than a woman, so it just seems to make sense.  They don't put any weight on, like, a woman's, like, that psychological ability of them to  mind fuck you.  Yeah.  That's all it was.  I'm not saying that they all do that, but I'm saying the story you have, a lot of people 
[00:34:30]  have, but they never...  Yeah.  It depends how far he wants to go with this, man.  He's got a million great stories.  I was just always on coast.  That was my whole life back then, was just, all right, don't shake things up.  Let me just coast through this.  That's hilarious because you had the exact opposite relation.  My mother...  My dad used to always be cursing out my mother.  We used to be going down the bus stop, me and my two other brothers.  I'd be, like, first grade, first grade, third, and kindergarten.  We'd be standing down there.  We didn't have an air conditioner.  The windows would be open, and my dad would just be cursing out my mother. 
[00:35:00]  We're, like, 20 feet away at the bus stop.  Oh, you goddamn fucking bitch.  You've been doing the same shit for years.  Oh, that's bullshit, Linda.  That is fucking bullshit.  And we're, like, sitting down there.  It's because it's, like, jump ropes, like, looking at it and stuff.  We're trying to play it off, like, eh, wonder where else that's coming from.  The drapes are blowing out the window.  He's yelling so loud.  Maybe it is the upbringing.  It's the exact opposite.  See, my father was that way, too. 
[00:35:30]  My father was always, you know, he was a real prick just yelling all the time.  Motherfucker!  I remember, and I've told this story on the air, the vivid memory as a child is an argument  during dinner where his plate of spaghetti and meatballs was just launched against the  wall.  Like, he picked it up and threw it, and then they just start yelling at each other.  And I'm a little kid sitting there looking at the spaghetti sauce just sliding slowly down  the old wall with the bell telephone next to it on the wall. 
[00:36:00]  Just, like, it was this horrifying moment as a child.  Maybe, you know, I grew up and decided I'm never going to argue back.  I'll just be this guy.  Yes, poochie.  Yes, dear.  We'll play that going into break because that's a great, great production piece.  Just to avoid confrontation.  That was me.  Wow.  Avoid confrontation, guy.  I had the same shit.  Let's go to Kevin in Minnesota.  Kevin!  What's up, boys?  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, man.  What's up, Jimmy's replacement?  It's Bill Burr, everyone.  We haven't introduced Bill today.  Bill Burr, let me give you one thing about Bill Burr. 
[00:36:30]  His half-hour comedy special is on HBO Tonight at Midnight.  Tonight, I'm hearing really good things about Bill Burr's comedy special.  Yeah, it's called Jimmy's replacement, one-night stand on HBO.  Check it out tonight at Midnight on HBO, and then it's going to run a bunch after that, I'm sure.  And Bill getting raves for his job yesterday, sitting in.  Awesome.  Absolutely.  I read a lot and getting rave reviews.  Very good.  Kevin, what do you have for the show?  Well, I was kind of wondering what your ex-old lady, which kind of sounds like a bitch, personally, 
[00:37:00]  but what did she do while you were at work earning an income, while she was sitting there stroking her five pussies?  Well, let me tell you, up in Ashland, Mass., she did work.  She was, I guess, she worked at a Papageno's when we first got there.  And then, it depends how far he wants to go with this.  See, I didn't realize she had such a huge leg to stand on.  Well, that was, you know, bringing in the Papageno's money. 
[00:37:30]  And then there was...  This is, while we were becoming, I've got to say it again, rock and roll radio stars.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Then, the job, she got the job at the liquor store, which, oof, wow.  Like putting a pedophile in charge of a nursery.  That was, wowie kazowie.  But at least she drove herself to work, so that was a good thing.  No, no.  At least she didn't have to worry about that.  Well, that would have been a good thing.  She never got a license. 
[00:38:00]  She never got a license to drive.  Yeah.  So, what I had to deal with was driving her everywhere.  Everywhere she had to go, I had to drive.  She's just bitching the whole time.  So, there was a lot of that, yes.  A lot of the arguments.  And I would drive her to work and then have to drive me to work.  And then, she would get off of work before I did, because I worked until 7.  When she'd get off of work, what she would do is grab one of those boxes of wine. 
[00:38:30]  And bring it to her mom's house, which was less than a half mile from the liquor store.  Now, I would have to, instead of just getting done with my day and driving home, having my slippers and pipe waiting for me,  I would have to drive to the mother's house.  Which was kind of far.  It wasn't that far, but it was out of the way.  I had to pass my house.  It was far enough to be a hassle after a while.  I had to pass my house in order to get to her house, which I didn't want to do after work.  It's 7 o'clock at night. 
[00:39:00]  I just wanted to go home, wind down, or maybe stop at Green Acres over there in Ashland and down a few drinks or something like that.  But I had to go to the mother's house, where they would both sit now, and it wasn't an immediately leave thing.  Now I had to sit in the basement with her and her mother as they watched videos of that day's general hospital, days of our lives, and friends.  So now I'm sitting on the couch.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Until 10, from 7 to like 10.  I'm just picturing your whole posture, like your head down, shoulders slumped.  Dude.  It was a nightmare.  And this was every night, so then it would be like 10 o'clock.  I'd caught up on general hospital and days of our lives and friends.  And they would just get sauced on the wine, the box of wine, and I would get tanked on my Jack and Coke or Captain Morgan and Coke, and then hop in the car and drive. 
[00:40:00]  So what would you do?  Were you trying to be like the friend here going?  He lived it.  Gently nudge him to like, dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?  I was just the friend that dragged him out of there.  I don't know.  We had fun at work and stuff.  At work.  Like I said, work was such a pisser.  And I don't even think he knew what was going on because, you know, we'd go out.  Our outings were just classic when we would go.  Yeah.  Like it would be open go.  Hey, Ant, let's go to, what was that place called? 
[00:40:30]  Mother Anna's?  Mother Anna's.  Sure.  In the North End.  We'd go, hey, let's go to Mother Anna's for dinner tonight.  All right.  Jen, we're going to Mother Anna's with Opie Sandy and Jay from Framingham.  All right.  Oh, Mom wants to go.  What?  Mom wants to go.  Yeah, but it's just kind of an us guys thing.  His mother-in-law had to go hanging out thing.  Yeah, but we want to have fun.  But we just want to have fun.  She had to go pretty much everywhere we went.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  She was cool to a point, but.  But they really enjoyed the drinking.  So it kind of got a little.  We'd all be in the middle of like having a good time and her mother would out of nowhere just go, I want to go home.  And we'd be like.  Right as the strippers coming out of the cake.  Blow out the candles for a second.  I want to go home.  So now, you know, we're in Boston and she lives in Ashland. 
[00:41:30]  So now I got to hop in the car and drive back to Ashland.  Right when it was getting good.  Right when, like, we were hanging.  It's getting fun.  We're all buzzed and now the comedy is really flowing.  We're all laughing our asses off.  Unbelievable.  And that God rest her soul, by the way, for those of you that don't know, Judy passed.  Judy passed a few months ago.  In July and, you know, she was fun.  She was a lot of fun.  I mean, she was definitely a pisser.  But, you know, as a mother-in-law type thing. 
[00:42:00]  Judy's now with Chester.  That's right.  And she always wanted that, so.  Yeah.  Rest in peace.  But it was a hell of a lifestyle I was leading there.  During the radio show, during our appearances out, it was just a friggin' nightmare.  We would, oh, my God.  Remember the Kahlua girls?  We're doing shots.  And girls are inviting us to go skinny dipping.  These Kahlua girls.  You ever see these liquor girls, promo girls? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  They walk around like the Budweiser girls and stuff.  The Budweiser girls.  And the Kahlua girls were dressed in, like, these little tight skirts and stuff.  And they're like, yeah, why?  And we're all getting hammered together.  We're both.  We're getting paid, like, I guess, a hundred bucks a night to be there.  We were both assholes because we were both in shaky relationships, to say the least.  But we're good guys.  Good guys.  And we're doing this appearance, and we're, like, becoming rock stars, and these young  Kahlua girls are just hammered, and we're doing shots with them, and all of a sudden  they're like, you guys want to go skinny dipping? 
[00:43:00]  This one Kahlua girl comes up to me.  She comes up to me, and she's got pigtails and braces.  And she goes, I really like you.  And she's, like, grabbing me.  And she goes, we're all going skinny dipping at the lake because we're really close to the  lake.  And I want you to come with me.  I've got to go home to the cats and the garbage and the vacuum and the box of wine and friends 
[00:43:30]  and general hospital.  No, I can't go skinny dipping with you.  We were the worst.  We would end up driving home pretty much crying to each other.  I'd be steering with my rod.  Yeah, that was a great gig, Opie.  We're like, do you realize what we just said no to?  How many times I wanted to throw that in her face.  During one of those things.  It's like, why don't you take the garbage?  Do you know what I'm offered?  Do you know what I'm offered when we do those fucking bar gigs? 
[00:44:00]  I could be fucking a girl with pigtails and braces.  A Yager girl.  That's old enough to drink.  Barely.  Yeah.  That's funny, the spaghetti thing.  My mother, one time, my dad was, she just finally couldn't take it anymore.  She was feeding my baby sister a bowl of Apple Jacks and she finally just took them.  You always remember the food.  She didn't throw the bowl.  Just went like this in the milk and the Apple Jacks went flying.  My dad had like a cowlick, too, in the front, so it was perfect. 
[00:44:30]  Glanced off his head.  It looked like the Kennedy assassination.  Glanced off his head and just sprayed across the wall behind it, dude.  It was great.  There was all this milk and Apple Jacks and there was fucking silence like, oh my God, she  finally fought back.  And my dad didn't know what to do.  He's got like cereal in the front of his fucking hair.  And he just walked out.  And all of us were going like, that's what you gotta do, Mom.  Anytime he does it, you just take a bowl of cereal, you fucking throw it in his face.  Oh, is that funny? 
[00:45:00]  Did it maintain its bowl-like shape for a few seconds?  Oh, yeah, but then.  Before it struck him.  Oh, it was great.  Like slow motion, you could kind of see it coming.  God, that is fantastic.  Back and to the left.  Oh, that is great.  But then, of course, the relationship went after that, like within 10 seconds.  She's cleaning it up.  Right.  Watching the wall and then it goes right back to everything.  Yeah, where it's supposed to be.  Yeah.  Got thrown out of whack for a second.  Yeah.  Oh, that is great.  He regains his footing with his milk-soaked hair.  He probably knew he couldn't fight back because you can't be very tough with Apple Jacks 
[00:45:30]  in your hair and the milk.  Let's go to Michigan and say hi to John.  John, what's going on?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, I wanted to ask Anthony, his wife took all his money out of the bank and they got divorced.  Whatever she'd go on to do, did she ever go on and get married or anything like that?  And is he in spite of her?  No, I don't know.  I don't know much of anything she's doing.  I do know that the money that I've earned doing radio has bought her a house. 
[00:46:00]  I know she has a house.  And she finally got her driver's license and so she's...  Oh, did she?  No.  Oh, you don't know?  No, that was a joke.  Oh.  She didn't.  Yeah.  I was going to say, you don't care what she did.  I don't have to buy the car.  No, because after...  Good.  Well, then she was like just taking public transportation and stuff and buses.  Yeah.  Well, there was something that went on like when she was a teen or something.  She got in a car and went to drive it and like came out of a parking lot and went right into a tree. 
[00:46:30]  So like ever since then, she just figured she wouldn't get a license.  So I had to drive her everywhere.  Nightmare.  All right.  We should take a break.  Wow.  That's therapeutic.  Yes.  That was weird.  That's not how we were going to start the show.  That's why you got to listen to the show every day.  You never know.  We don't even know what we're doing on a daily basis.  You think that was written on one of these papers that are in front of us?  Hell no.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton once again today. 
[00:47:00]  Very funny guy.  He's got his half hour comedy special tonight on HBO at midnight.  Make sure you check it out.  All right.  I guess we'll break and we'll figure out what we do next.  How's that?  Sure.  A little Stephen Lynch song because it's appropriate.  And then the War of the Coomias thing that Steve put together.  We got a lot more comedy right here.  So stay there.  Hush, little girl, sweet baby, don't cry tonight. 
[00:47:30]  Daddy is here and he'll sing you a soft lullaby tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before?  How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore? 
[00:48:00]  Because daddy likes porno and ten dollar whores.  Daddy gets wasted in Rob's liquor stores.  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus.  I think that's why mommy's not here and they'll be like it was before?  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Mom? 
[00:48:30]  Hush, little girl, there is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke.  Don't mind the smoke.  Daddy just wants to forget.  Tonight.  Soon it will all be like it was before.  Any minute she will walk through that front door. 
[00:49:00]  But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer.  And then he wants sex that involves mommy's rear.  Daddy has sores on his naughty parts.  Losing with pus.  I think that's why you're mommy left us. 
[00:49:30]  Please don't cry.  I swear I'll try to be here by your side.  Right after daddy gets home from the bar,  He visits his bookie and steals a new car.  He'll drive to the strip club.  And if daddy plays his cards right, 
[00:50:00]  He'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da-da.  De-da-da-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da.  La-dee-da-da.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain. 
[00:50:30]  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias.  I had the yelling parents too, growing up, until they got divorced.  And it was just, you know.  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it.  And it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there horrified, watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you.  Get the fuck out of the wall.  Fuck you.  Oh, I'm a horrified kid.  Did dad actually leave? 
[00:51:00]  After the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep.  Because the yelling would stop.  First mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole.  You know, even after dad left, she's still going.  That shit, like, I need a fucking hole in the head.  I'm trying to sleep.  He's gone.  Shut up.  I'm sitting here.  Shut up.  I'll wear you back.  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back?  The next day?  Yeah, like, the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down, watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing.  Everything was fine. 
[00:51:30]  You know?  And then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed, and you'd hear, like...  Wait a minute.  And then you'd hear from the kids.  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for, like, one night?  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got, you know, called into the room, and  Mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with  you, we're divorced. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, okay.  Can I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  That fucking asshole!  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming?  No way!  Is that...  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp. 
[00:52:30]  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Kumiahs.  It's got to be, you're going to just sit there disgusted, having to listen to this crap.  Ah, you're checking out the O.B. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The Rolling Stones.  We all went to the Rolling Stones show last night at the Meadowlands.  We've got to get Ben in here and Martini Steve. 
[00:53:00]  There's a little problem.  I guess we should get into it.  Eric is very, very pissed off this morning.  Extremely pissed off.  Hey, quickly, Jacob from Jersey is wondering if, right when the divorce papers were assigned,  if I screamed,  FREEDOM!  My guts were taken out.  That was a happy day for you.  Yeah.  It was a very happy day.  It certainly was.  So, most of the gang today, very sluggish. 
[00:53:30]  Anthony went home and took it easy.  Yeah.  We all went down to the Meadowlands for the Rolling Stones show.  And we had to be there at like five because we did like a VIP party for XM.  They flew in salespeople from all over the country.  Supposedly, they're all showing up here today.  Yeah.  Right.  I don't think that's happening.  These guys like to drink, man.  Holy.  Oh, man.  Hey, Steve.  Steve.  Hi, fellas.  What's up, Steve?  How are you?  All I know is...  Never gets old. 
[00:54:00]  No.  Will and the gang got hammered, but they promised they were going to bring a busload of some  of these XM people from around the country over here today to check out the show because  they're all big fans of the show.  Will will definitely make it.  He's a trooper.  Yeah, he will.  And hopefully the attractive sales girl will come by who's got some fans here already.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe Will can tell some of those stories that he was telling us last night.  But...  Sounds like a good time was had by all.  Great time.  Or, well, maybe not all, but... 
[00:54:30]  It was an unbelievable live time.  Alanis Morissette warmed up, but no one saw her perform.  No one cared.  No one cares about the opening gig anymore?  Well, they have great acts on the other parts of the tour.  Metallica's opening, the White Stripes, Pearl Jam.  Molly Crew.  Why couldn't we get Metallica running up for the Rolling Stones?  Metallica's doing their hometown gig in San Francisco.  You get Alanis Morissette?  Out of all the bands that have come out of Jersey and New York, you know, why couldn't  they get one of the, like, Bon Jovi or somebody just to step up and say, yeah, what the hell, 
[00:55:00]  we'll warm up for you guys.  And you've got to respect that you're in your 60s and you're not scared to follow Metallica.  That's pretty impressive.  They got nothing to worry about.  The Stones still play great.  I mean, there's no...  Let me tell you something.  I love Metallica, but James Hetfield as a front man compared to Mick Jagger, you can't  even compare the two.  Can't even compare the two.  It's two different things.  Last time I saw Metallica...  Come on.  Oh, it was when we saw Metallica.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, with Jim.  James Hetfield, he just seemed, like, not attached to the audience. 
[00:55:30]  You know, he sounded great and all that, but when it came to, you know, to just, I don't  know, talking to the crowd and all that, he just seemed kind of distant, like he was...  He's never been a work-the-crowd kind of guy.  It's a stand there and, yeah, he's got an insert city name here monologue that he does.  Yeah, right.  So Alanis Morissette, I guess, went on.  I don't know.  I didn't see her.  No one did.  I mean, there was, like, ten people in the crowd.  No joke, man.  Well, wow.  They were just starting to file in when she started, and then this is the new thing at concerts,  and then it's the hour break. 
[00:56:00]  An hour.  An hour between Alanis Morissette and then when the Stones finally hit the stage.  Not like that in the old days.  Because you've got to drink up, man.  Yeah.  Got to drink up.  Got to get your beers in.  They pretty much just changed the equipment over, and then the act would come on, the headliner.  Remember, it used to be like a pit crew when we were growing up.  Yeah.  One band would get off, and the other band would just be pushing the drum sets right off the  back of the stage.  The opening band would get jabbed.  They'd have the headline band's equipment all set up, covered with sheets, and then the 
[00:56:30]  opening band would have a little spot, front stage, and they'd get done, and then the  headliner would come on.  Being dwarfed by the drum kit of the headlining.  Huge drum kit, and then there's this little friggin' drum set.  Well, you can't cover up the Rolling Stones stage.  No.  Oh, my God.  It was like ten stories high or something.  Did they have all the walkways and stuff with Mick?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That guy runs around like a maniac still.  Well, that's what I was going to say.  Last time I saw the Stones was 1989, and I'm thinking, come on, they must have lost something 
[00:57:00]  since 1989.  The new CD's getting really good reviews and stuff, and went last night, I was blown  away.  Mick Jagger's what, 62?  62.  He's 62 years old, running around like he's in his 30s, no problem, the whole time.  The whole, he's just ripped.  He's cut.  He knows he's cut, too, because a few songs, he's pulling up his shirt like he's hot, but  he's leaving it up so the girls can check out his ab work.  And he's in his 60s. 
[00:57:30]  Goddamn.  And there was like at least three generations in the audience, at least.  Yeah.  There were, I mean, there were women walking around, and you're like, wow, that's a grandma.  There's no, there's no mistaking.  That, that woman is a grandma.  It's the Rolling Stones, swear.  I love them.  All the way down to girls in their early 20s.  You know, it was the whole gamut, man.  Did you have to listen to people's awful stories around you?  I saw them in 1972.  I blew the original rhythm guitars at the Fillmore back when I had teak. 
[00:58:00]  But completely blown away, man, completely.  It was just a great show.  An absolute great show.  And I noticed that, did anyone else notice the planes were flying over all night long?  Yeah, planes were going right overhead.  I mean, right through, you know, the top of the, whatever, above, obviously.  But right, split in the stadium.  And you can, I, I, you can almost feel what the pilot was saying to, you know, the people  on board.  You know, the Rolling Stones are, you know, playing right now. 
[00:58:30]  If you want to look below.  Look to your left.  Oh, yeah.  Because these things were going right over the stadium, man.  One after another.  One, I mean, every single one.  Every, every minute it was another plane flying right overhead.  Yeah, they did the same thing when the, the Who was playing over there years ago.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's kind of annoying, though.  Right.  You want to listen to a song and.  Mick Jagger's, Mick Jagger's such a showman.  I think he knew that was going on because he was kind of pointing up to the planes a few  times.  Almost like, I know they're probably, you know, telling the people to look down at this 
[00:59:00]  point.  So he's looking up.  It would suck.  You got the middle seat on your way to, like, Seattle.  Yeah.  Like six hours.  If you look down, there's 60,000 people having the time of their life.  Right.  He's just leaning over to Keith, pointing at the plane and going, I could buy that.  Charlie Watts looked like he's not going to make it.  Yeah.  He's just tapping away on his drums.  Then he had the big casino.  He did, right?  He did.  He beat it.  He beat the big casino, Tony.  He beat the big casino.  He had throat cancer.  Yeah, he beat it.  Wow.  And Keith Richards still plays great. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  How's he looking these days?  Like an alien.  He looks like an alien with a wig, basically.  And Ron Wood just looks like a gay guy.  He's wearing girl shirts and stuff.  Like an old queen.  I don't know what.  But I don't know what his deal is.  I have no clue.  Do you know?  No, he's marrying his kids.  Holy crap, man.  He was wearing like, you know, girls.  What's that one story?  Express or Express?  Wasn't it him that his son was going out with the dog?  No, that was Bill Wyman.  That was Bill Wyman.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Ron Wood.  I was wondering who it was. 
[01:00:00]  His son was going out with the mother of the daughter that Bill Wyman was fucking.  Oh, yeah.  It's just some kind of sordid, horrific story.  Well, Bill Wyman, I mean, he started dating that girl when she was like 12 or something.  Some ridiculous thing.  And then he married her and then they were divorced in like two years.  Yeah.  He decided he didn't need to do the Stones thing anymore.  I was right.  It was a Kahlua girl with braces and pigtails.  But it wasn't like seeing, you know, Kiss at the end of their career where it was like  it was almost like kind of a goof to me to see Kiss. 
[01:00:30]  The Rolling Stones are still making it happen.  And then the stage just kind of lifted up and they moved the stage completely to the  middle of Giant Stadium and did four songs out there.  That's something.  The mechanics behind stage shows these days.  That was pretty cool.  And as it's slowly moving, the crowd is just losing their minds.  But a lot of money.  Half of the parking lot is tractor trailers to haul this massive set around.  It's amazing.  You just don't get an idea.  You get an idea of how massive this thing is just when you hit the parking lot and you 
[01:01:00]  see, you know, just the whole perimeter of the first layer of parking spaces is all  semis.  Yeah.  Because the stage set is as high as Giant Stadium is and as wide as, what is it?  It weighs 150 tons.  It's the biggest stage ever constructed in rock and roll.  Steve is actually able to land in his seat.  He bypassed the parking lot completely and landed his car right in his own seat.  No parking problems for Steve.  They weren't.  But anyway, Eric is very pissed off. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, now Eric is pissed.  You would think, when I heard, because right when I walked in, I think it was Ben said,  Eric is really pissed.  So I go, okay, the 100 grand thing was a scam.  Right.  Turns out, no.  The 100 grand thing is not a scam.  Turns out Eric had one of the best days of his life and one of the worst days of his life  all on the same day.  So I'm thinking, start out great, ended really, really bad.  You win 100 grand.  Well, all right, let's quickly cover that. 
[01:02:00]  Was it the Post or the Daily News?  Daily News.  You better know.  The Daily News had a contest in their paper a few months back.  You might remember this because it made the national news.  It's some kind of, what was the game called?  Do you remember?  Scratch and Match.  Scratch and Match.  They're still doing it on the front page of the Daily News today.  Yeah, there's a new one coming out on Sunday.  It's all new Scratch and Match.  So what you would do is scratch some numbers off.  If they match the numbers, corresponding numbers by some money values, like a lottery ticket, 
[01:02:30]  you win that amount.  There was a misprint on these Scratch and Match tickets.  So a shitload of people across New York that bought the paper scratched the number and realized,  holy shit, I won $100,000.  And they were only supposed to have maybe four or five winners, right?  Total, yeah.  Total.  Out of the whole contest.  But instead, there were hundreds because of the misprint.  Hundreds of winners.  Because they misprinted one of the numbers.  So their solution to this whole thing was, okay, write your name, address, all this crap, 
[01:03:00]  send it in, and we'll have a drawing out of all the people.  Well, this was after a lot of people lost their shit.  Protesting.  They all wanted their money.  Well, we saw it on the news, and every story sounded like, I had plans for that money already.  I already spent it.  I spent it.  The Daily News, they can't take people's dreams and step alone.  Like, they were entitled.  And it was, I'm sorry, I don't know why.  It was all black people that were protesting.  Reverend Al came out for them against the Daily News. 
[01:03:30]  Celine Dion.  Celine screaming.  Why buy these people?  At least buy them a kayak.  Let them touch the people.  Let them touch the money.  They can break through the wall.  Get the money from the Daily News.  Awful woman.  And they figured they would take all the people that thought they won.  Hundreds of people.  Put them in a drawing.  Right.  And pick the money out of the proverbial hat. 
[01:04:00]  And whoever won gets $100,000.  How many total winners out of the pick out of the hat did they have?  Five.  Five total winners.  Out of, I mean, I don't know how many people were in it.  Do you?  Do you know how many people entered?  It was a lot of pissed off people that thought they won $100,000 and entered.  Five people are picked out of this hat that win $100,000.  Do you know who one of those people were?  Our own hawk. 
[01:04:30]  Eric Nagel was the winner of $100,000.  He won $100,000 yesterday.  From the Daily News.  Late in the show, Ben busted into the studio.  Lily White, Eric Nagel.  I want to know what the other four people are.  I want to know if they're white.  Because I am going to say that it is racially motivated.  So he won $100,000.  Eric saying, shut up until I get my check, asshole.  He gets it today.  He gets it today.  Is it a big, giant one?  No, they don't do that.  Where are they presenting it?  It's being certified. 
[01:05:00]  It's going to send to my house.  Going to your house?  Yeah.  Where do you live?  Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Well, last night he lived at the station, I think.  We'll get into that in a second.  Yeah, because now I thought when I heard that he was pissed off, I assumed that it was a scam and he didn't win the $100,000.  And I thought he was pissed at that.  It turns out the Daily News came by, took a nice picture of Eric and probably the other winners, wherever they live or work.  Where did they take the picture? 
[01:05:30]  Right here in the studio.  In front of the ONA, son.  In front of the ONA, son, you motherfucker.  You're great.  Little promotion, too.  That's good.  And did they do a little quick interview with you about who you are and what you're doing?  No, there was no interview.  They just had the names and they just needed photos.  That was it.  They're doing some big thing on Sunday's page.  But isn't it usually Eric who works at blah, blah, blah?  That will be mentioned, yeah.  That will be mentioned.  That will be mentioned, Eric, from the Opie and Anthony show.  Very good.  I think the picture's going to be in Sunday's Daily News.  Sunday's Daily News. 
[01:06:00]  Everyone picks that one up.  We've got to call David Hinckley.  David Hinckley would write about this.  Yeah, he'd write about it.  One of our guys wins $100,000.  Mm-hmm.  So that's how his day started.  And then he went to the Rolling Stones with us and he was left behind.  And he's really mad at everyone, but I can easily defend myself.  You got from the story I heard.  You guys ditched him.  That's what I'm getting.  We didn't ditch you.  In one of the most obscure places in the tri-state area. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  The Meadowlands.  Look, Meadow, here's the deal.  I drove to the Stones show.  You drove?  Yeah.  Your own vehicle.  It was Lindsey and I, Ben, and Eric.  Mm-hmm.  And we did the XM thing, meet and greet, blah, blah, blah.  Everyone's drinking, having a good time, eating New York D'oeuvres, blowing off Alanis Morissette.  And it's time to go to our seats.  And we have seats all over the place.  First of all, I had no idea you weren't sitting in our section.  I had no idea either.  When you guys were going in that area where you had those colored bracelets, they looked 
[01:07:00]  at my ticket and said, no, you're going this way.  And you guys were already way down, so I couldn't even say anything to you.  Well, I'm going to start with that.  No, you knew.  You knew because you told me before.  I said, I have a side seat.  You guys have the floor.  Yes.  And he said, but we're all going this way.  They turned me around.  Look at all the bracelets we had to wear yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  I actually had a fourth one, too.  There was a fourth one that I had, because you had one for the party and one for the floor.  Cops everywhere.  The security was.  Eric had like one.  Huh? 
[01:07:30]  You just had like one bracelet?  Well, this is.  Sitting in the back, stupid, written on the side.  Wow.  Oh, I had a really good seat.  This just in from Yahoo Finance.  They found out Eric won $100,000.  Hellman's stock up two points.  Oh, very good.  I thought you were going to pick another product, but you did very good, Anthony.  So, we were leaving the party.  Here's the first mistake you made, Eric. 
[01:08:00]  And we'll let you, you know, try to defend yourself here.  We all went in the elevator together.  Yeah.  Didn't we?  Yes.  What happened to you?  Is this when you got there?  No, after the party, we were way up in the box.  Luxury box?  Way above the stadium, partying and stuff.  Of course you were.  And then there was about 100 of us from XM.  We all took the elevators.  These massive elevators.  You know, I don't know.  We had to take like two elevators.  But Eric was in the elevator with all of us. 
[01:08:30]  We're going down to now find our seats on the floor.  Little did we know he wasn't on the floor.  I did not know that, okay?  And we started walking from the elevator toward our seats.  We stopped to wait for you for at least five to ten minutes.  At least.  When we got off the elevator and we left, as we're going around the side, that lady, that  little old lady who was checking the tickets, she says, no, you can't go this way.  Oh, boy.  And I said, why?  And he goes, because you don't have that little band, that little, um, one of these red band 
[01:09:00]  thing there.  Oh, the wristband guy.  And I go, are you kidding me?  I said, I know we're not sitting together, but they told me we're all going into the same  area.  No, you can't go in there.  You've got to go all the way around the other way.  And when I turn around.  Wait, we have audio of you talking to the woman.  Liar, whore, liar, whore, you know it.  Now, maybe she was pissed because you were yelling at her.  Shut your goddamn piehole.  So you weren't on the floor?  No.  Okay.  So that's what happened, Ben.  Yeah, they wouldn't let me follow you. 
[01:09:30]  We waited for 10 or 15 minutes.  Like, where is he?  So why wouldn't you call us at that time and say that, look, guys, I thought I was on the  floor and I'm not on the floor?  Because that's the biggest problem here, first of all.  All right.  Well, when we got the tickets and I looked at it, I said to Ben, oh, I got, um, I didn't  get the bracelet because I had the side stage.  And everybody else, I checked with Steve and everybody else had floor seats.  So pretty much everyone knew I wasn't sitting with you guys.  Uh-huh.  I had no idea, to be honest with you.  So, but you didn't call anyone.  Because you already knew. 
[01:10:00]  Uh-oh.  You had a cell phone.  You got cell phone.  Everyone's in constant communication.  We got cell phones and BlackBerry.  All right, well, at that point, when I wasn't allowed to continue past that barrier where  everybody else was gone and they were already down, I turned around and won the direction  that they told me to.  See, at that point, I would have called Ben, Steve, myself and say, hey, I thought I was  with you guys.  I'm not.  I just want to let you know that.  But it's definite.  I couldn't follow you guys.  Yeah, instead of being let off to some water.  Because that was the last time.  Well, seriously, that was the last time I saw him.  That was the last time I saw him. 
[01:10:30]  But we had this plan that we were going to leave early, right?  Yeah.  Because it's Giant Stadium.  It's a nightmare to leave a concert or a football game, for that matter, and get back into the  city.  It's a nightmare.  Yeah.  And we have to do the radio show.  I was thinking, stupid me, I don't want to be out until 1.30 in the morning because I'm  stuck in crazy traffic.  So you ditched him.  Well, no, I didn't ditch him originally.  Now, hold on.  Here's the deal.  He didn't call you to tell you where he was and needing the ride.  Did you bother calling him and saying, Eric, where are you? 
[01:11:00]  I called.  You were a few times.  Ben called twice as we were leaving the stadium.  I got one message from Ben, and all I heard was the Rolling Stones and what sounded something  like Ben, because I couldn't hear his voice at all on there.  Who do you think it was?  It had to be one of us.  Jumping back, flat.  Ah!  Don't count.  Where are you?  You couldn't hear his voice.  Well, we had two plans.  Somebody calling.  We had two plans.  The plan was to leave after Sympathy for the Devil or 10-30.  Don't show the list, because I'm going to ask him a couple of very tough questions here. 
[01:11:30]  Uh-oh.  Very tough questions.  Just immediately.  So, logically, that makes sense.  Leave the concert early.  We've got to beat the traffic out of there.  Of course.  So we're not stuck for an hour, hour and a half.  I never stay for the encore.  Okay?  Yeah.  So, uh, I said that we would start thinking about leaving around 10-30, right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Did we also say that we would start leaving after Sympathy for the Devil?  Because Ben kind of knew the set list.  I believe so, yeah.  All right.  So, so far, two for two, okay?  So where were you at 10-30 or after Sympathy for the Devil? 
[01:12:00]  Between gate C and B in the parking lot.  Because I didn't know exactly where he had parked, but it was right near that gate where  we came in.  So I stood right there looking and waiting.  So you were definitely out of the stadium at 10-30?  I was definitely out there, yes.  Okay.  So far, so good.  That's one for the defense, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, Bill and Anthony, you could decide who's wrong, okay?  I see Eric right now, though.  I see him in a different light.  He's a fancy person who deserves a ride home.  Anthony, first of all, we did stay for Sympathy for the Devil. 
[01:12:30]  Woo!  Woo!  And then we stayed for Jumping Jack Flash, which was right after that.  And then Ben, myself, and Lindsey started running during Brown Sugar to get the fuck  out of there.  Uh-huh.  Running.  Ben's freaking...  I finally...  Well...  What was the last song they did?  Well, we only missed two songs, it turned out.  You can't always get what you want, which I would really want to see.  That's a pretty good one to see.  And it's only rock and roll, which is whatever to me.  Yeah.  But just a quick side story.  I'm sitting in my seats. 
[01:13:00]  I'm going to my seats, and some security guard yells out,  Greg!  Oh.  And I turn, like, how the fuck do you know him?  He goes, no, I know you're open, but I don't want to, like, draw attention to you.  I'm a big fan, man.  Thank you.  He goes, I would do anything for you guys.  I'm like, really?  Well, how about better seats?  Ooh.  Because we were way back in the floor.  And that was me joking.  You know how we are.  I'm like, how about better seats?  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Let me see what I can do.  And I don't think anything of it, and I sit in my seats, right?  About a half hour into the concert, he comes by with another big security guard, 
[01:13:30]  and he goes, come here.  And everyone around us thought we were getting kicked out, like, uh-oh, what did they do wrong?  This guy got me up to the 40th row.  I was right there.  That's huge.  Like, my seats were amazing for the second half of the concert.  But knowing that we all had a meet, after Sympathy for the Devil, I started making my  way back to the, you know, back to the floor to find Ben.  That's the only person I, because at this point, I still haven't seen Eric.  I assumed he was still in our section.  I grabbed Ben.  Ben sees me immediately.  He's like, dudes, we got to get the fuck out of here.  So that's when we started running during, I guess, Brown Sugar. 
[01:14:00]  As we're running out, I'm like, what about Eric?  Have you seen him?  Ben goes, no.  Haven't seen him since, you know, since the party.  I'm like, give him a call at least, okay?  See where he's at.  He definitely called you.  I know he did.  I couldn't hear his message, because all I heard was the stones.  But why are your calls back?  He didn't pick up.  You didn't pick up.  I even text messaged him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait a minute.  No, I got messages from you when I woke up this morning.  Nah, nah, my phone, nah, stop.  You did not call my phone.  I'll show you the phone. 
[01:14:30]  Liar, whore, liar, whore, you know it.  My phone was on the whole time.  Uh-oh.  What is he doing?  What are you calling now?  I just like the visual of them running.  Just running away.  You have to, though.  If you've ever been stuck in that traffic, you're two hours in.  Forever.  Giant Stadium is ruthless.  Giant Stadium is brutal.  There's only a few roads out, you know.  And so we run into the parking lot.  Now, when we arrived at Giant Stadium very early around 5...  So didn't that affect your decision? 
[01:15:00]  What?  Knowing how bad the traffic was to leave one of the members of your platoon behind?  Right.  Willem Dafoe.  On my fucking knees in the parking lot.  Yeah, but it wasn't like it was Anthony or...  Helicopter leaving.  It wasn't like it was Anthony or Jim Norton, though, you know.  Oh!  Eric's on his knees, both hands outstretched.  Yeah.  I don't have to kiss his ass.  How concerned?  I don't have to kiss his ass.  I got my own money. 
[01:15:30]  How long was the conversation?  Right.  How long did the conversation last?  Before you put it into drive.  You guys seen Eric?  No, well, I...  He's with you.  I'm getting there, but there is another side thing.  We get there at 5 o'clock.  It's Giant Stadium.  The parking lot is pretty empty.  So instead of going, oh, we're at D3, we're like, oh, we know where we parked, and we  just run into the stadium, okay?  We kind of get a visual, like, okay, that thing over there, oh, and that light pole.  Okay, fine.  So Ben and I and Lindsey, we run out during Brown Sugar.  Now we're like, we've got to get to the fucking car. 
[01:16:00]  Ben's like, dude, there's 10 minutes left.  There's two songs left.  I'm telling you, this place is going to clear out at any moment.  Also, we run out to this completely filled parking lot.  It looks completely different.  We all start looking around, and I wasn't drinking last night, and I'm like, holy shit,  where do we park?  Had no fucking clue.  So as I said, where do we park?  I had my direction I thought I was in.  Ben's like, it's over there.  Lindsey's like, it's over there.  Everyone is pointing in a different direction.  And now the panic is setting in, because you know this thing is letting out at any second. 
[01:16:30]  There were 70,000 people there.  Mix on stage.  You want to hear one more?  You've got time for one more.  And we're just, like, scratching our head, running around the parking lot.  Where the fuck is the car?  It was like a game.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.  Good night.  No!  New Jersey rocks!  And it even got to the point, and that's where I, you're so wrong, Eric.  The fireworks were going off, because I guess they do that during the last song or whatever, 
[01:17:00]  and we still didn't find the car.  We had no clue.  Dude, we were running in all directions.  One more time for Charlie Waltz!  No!  So, it's kind of dark out there.  We're in three different sections.  And I'm hitting my thing, like, praying that all of a sudden I'm just going to see, like,  headlights.  Yeah, you need a long arrange on those things.  Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, with the lights going.  So, we kind of lucked out.  All of a sudden, I beeped, and I was only a couple rows away, and I start screaming, 
[01:17:30]  Oh, the hair!  And then they start running toward my voice, you were not at my car.  I know I wasn't at your car.  I said I wasn't at your car.  So, you didn't know where the car was?  Neither did you.  I just knew where the gate was where we came in.  But why aren't you calling us at that point?  You were hoping to meet with people, and not just find the car yourself.  You were going to meet them somewhere, because you didn't know where the car was.  I went to the area that I knew it was in.  I didn't know exactly where in that area.  You didn't hear us screaming?  We were losing our minds.  We were like, you know, screaming.  Freaking out.  We were freaking out. 
[01:18:00]  And we covered so much area, it's not even funny.  And we were all separate.  We were all separate.  We were all separate.  On phones, finding each other.  Dude, I had a run, after I was in the parking lot, easily a quarter mile circle.  Easily.  Just ran like this all the way around, and lucked out.  Finally, something started to make sense to me.  And as you're running, at any point, do you have any concern for Eric?  We called him during brown sugar.  We did have concern, and then when we did, well, wait a second, when we got in the car,  the thing was, he's going to be fine.  There was an XM bus coming back to the city. 
[01:18:30]  There was plenty of room on the XM bus.  Oh, oh, wait a minute.  There's another mode of transportation.  For all the XM people, they were going back to the Hudson Hotel.  Dude, there was a hundred people from XM.  Hold on, Eric, did you know about this bus?  Yes, I knew about this.  Okay, Eric did know about the bus.  Did you come over in the bus?  No, I came with Opie.  In the cut, wow.  Came with Opie.  You're a dick.  I'm just saying, you know, I'm looking good so far.  Come on.  I knew about the bus, but he did come with Opie.  Yes.  All right.  A little weigh in the decision.  So you were in the parking lot somewhere.  Yeah.  And you called Ben. 
[01:19:00]  When I got his, in the message I couldn't hear, I called him.  I even texted him.  I said, when are you guys leaving?  Where are you?  That phone, that's that temporary crap phone, and I had the BlackBerry number, which  is a Washington number, which is the temporary number that I have, while the other phone  gets fixed.  Uh-oh, so now I wasn't aware of the technical glitch.  I wasn't prepared technologically for the phone call.  There's a technical glitch in Ben's equipment.  Opie wasn't aware of where they parked.  I'm seeing a lot of negligence on the prosecution's part. 
[01:19:30]  I'm seeing a lot of negligence also, right?  Did you, when you got into your car to finally leave, Opie, right before you shut the door,  did you stand up on the bottom of the door and look around a little bit?  The fireworks were already going.  I see no concerns.  Opie, how many concerts have you been to in your life?  Oh my God, hundreds.  How many times have you been to the mall?  Hundreds.  A bunch of times.  Now, isn't one of the things you learn as a youth, the first time you get lost, to always  remember where you parked? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  So that was negligence on your part?  Yeah.  Negligence on his part.  He didn't know where we parked.  And there was the bus.  That's why we went there.  I was like, yeah, the bus thing really is a good one.  Right, right.  I see a group negligence, but you've got to accept responsibility as the guy that drove  is the leader.  You are the one that leaves the car and goes, look, we're at Goofy 5.  You know, we're at Mickey 8.  You know, you've got to let people know so there isn't any confusion.  And there's always other modes of transportation. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So I guess technically, in your world, you can always leave somebody behind.  There's an XM bus.  There's just ways to get back.  A Learjet.  We found the car.  The fireworks were going off.  And Ben goes, hurry, hurry, hurry.  We backed out and peeled out.  Flew.  I mean, it'll be drilled out really fast when we're flying.  But we...  You guys would make some great Army Rangers, man.  Never leave anyone behind.  Ah, fuck them.  The Iraqis will pick them up.  I'm the first person to leave someone at a concert. 
[01:21:00]  The POW flag is the silhouette of his head.  Eric's head just looking.  So, we pull...  You know, we're gone.  We're gone.  My phone didn't ring all the way to the city.  Is there any conversations about Eric?  Yeah.  And on the ride home, was there a...  Wow.  I said, don't worry.  He'll get on the bus.  Or I didn't know Steve had already left.  Steve lives right by the metal.  And you got the XM bus.  You got the New Jersey Transit.  And then there's always limo drivers.  You want $100,000 yesterday?  Yeah, you want $100,000, man.  You can get a limo easily after a concert there. 
[01:21:30]  A little resentment by other friends.  I'm seeing that also.  So, the guy wins $100,000 and they ditch him.  All right.  Well, I want to know about the bus.  When did you know we were gone?  11.15 and I'm standing by the exit gate where all the cars are going out and I realize they're gone.  I got to go try to find that bus.  11.15, you know what I was doing?  I swear to you, at 11.15, I was already asleep.  We were back in Manhattan.  I was him standing at the gate hoping to see Opie's car drive by and Opie in bed snoring. 
[01:22:00]  No joke.  Dude, no joke.  I ran home.  I didn't even brush my teeth.  Nothing.  I was in a nice room filled with A.C., all comfy.  Eric's still leaving pathetic messages.  Guys, I don't see you.  Where are you guys?  Are you still getting out?  Are you still getting out of the place?  Caught in the traffic?  I'm on the northeast side.  Right.  I was in la-la land. 
[01:22:30]  I was in deep sleep because it was a long day.  I was tired.  I'm not kidding.  I was out cold by 11.15 because we made it to the city in 15 minutes.  Nothing.  We were back so fast.  Yeah, that would explain the...  I'd have to say that the thought there's other modes of transportation is a euphemism for fuck them.  Right.  That is so fuck them.  Now, I want to know about the bus.  Now, the bus was...  All right, so now...  The XM bus.  You didn't realize we left you until 11.15.  That's crazy.  I stood by that gate.  Because you knew we wanted to get out of there by 10.30. 
[01:23:00]  We were even late leaving at that point.  Because you wouldn't think that, you know, friends of yours would be such a thing.  Right.  Right.  They couldn't possibly have left without me.  You must have panicked because...  Let someone else promote your HBO show.  I'm gone.  I'm gone.  I ain't.  He's like a...  He's getting attacked.  He's the guy that left.  You're blaming the victim.  Right.  What were you wearing, you fucking whore?  We can never be happy for anyone.  You rode over together.  You left the guy.  You fucked him.  I think subconsciously we can never be happy for anyone on this show.  And the fucking guy won 100,000 against today.  So we had to like...  He wasn't wearing the right wristband. 
[01:23:30]  He was asking for it.  Right.  You must have been in full panic mode, Eric.  Because I've got three calls on my phones from you around 11.15, 11.16.  I have four calls from you when I woke up this morning.  So I don't know.  Maybe something was going on with my phone.  Ben knows my phone did not ring.  No.  From brown sugar all the way home.  I'm telling you.  And then there's one text message.  So I see text message and it says from Eric.  And I'm like, oof.  You know, I know it's really ugly. 
[01:24:00]  Capital letters.  You fucking fuck.  That's exactly what it was.  So I hit read and I'm like, you know, and my eyes are closed and I open them up and it's  like, all it says is, thanks a lot, bro.  Oh, no.  You wrote bro.  All in big, big fuck you letters, you know.  Yeah, he was in concert speech.  Right.  Fuck you, bro.  Thanks a lot, bro.  And you can tell that the bro was typed out really hard.  B-R-O.  All in capitals. 
[01:24:30]  All in capitals.  And I'm like, oof.  This is going to be an ugly morgue.  I think that bro was sarcastic.  So at 11.15, you're watching the parking lot empty?  Yeah.  And at that point, I started calling Steve because I figured, all right, Steve probably  didn't leave early because he's not that far from there.  Maybe Steve's still stuck in the parking lot.  I can find Steve.  By the way, for the rest of the country.  Stuck in the parking lot.  He actually looked up and saw.  Oh, there he goes.  See, Steve.  Thanks another message.  Thanks a lot.  Oh, wow. 
[01:25:00]  Well, Steve stayed all the way through the fireworks, the encores and the goodbyes and  the thank yous because he doesn't have to wait in traffic with that hybrid.  No.  He flew over everybody.  Right over.  Mick pointed at his car.  It was great.  But look at that little thing.  It's the future.  But for the rest of the country, just so you know, Giant Stadium is in the middle of nowhere.  It's a swamp.  It's in the middle of a swamp.  A lot of these stadiums in other cities, he can walk a little bit and you find maybe  a taxi or something.  But not this case. 
[01:25:30]  You don't want to be left in the swamp.  No.  So 1115, you realize we're gone.  You're calling Steve.  They're gone.  So what happens?  No response from Steve.  So I said, fuck, I better try to find that XM bus.  So I go running over.  Buses are gone.  Buses are gone?  Buses are gone.  Don't you have Will's number?  No, I don't.  You don't have any of those guys' number?  Those buses were gone.  They moved.  They cleared that whole area for this big wraparound line that went almost around the entire stadium  for the buses for the transit authority. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, my God.  So that's where I wound up standing in line waiting to get a bus to get back to you.  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  You said this morning the bus was full.  Right.  The XM bus was full.  Oh, wait.  The guys want in.  Come on in.  Oh, my God.  Come on in.  Come on in, non-winners of $100,000.  What do you got to say, Danny?  No, I was just going to agree with Ben.  He did say this morning that he didn't get on the bus because the bus was full.  All right.  Not that the bus had left, but the bus was full.  This is now getting shaky on your butt.  The defense is falling apart.  No, but you need to examine him as a character witness. 
[01:26:30]  That's true.  I mean, he's also extremely jealous right now.  Yeah.  However, and also...  Willing to sell him down the river.  I would seriously doubt with the money that XM spent and these high-profile clients that came  in from all over the country, they would leave that fast and everybody would have gotten  back to the bus because people are buying T-shirts and stopped at the retail.  Yeah, for objection, speculation on the prosecution.  Throw it out.  Don't acknowledge his testimony now.  Throw it out.  So you never saw the XM bus?  No.  I didn't see them.  You're saying you never saw it, but you told people that it was full. 
[01:27:00]  You told people it was full.  Because my name wasn't on the list.  What?  Wait, what?  This is falling apart quickly.  Yeah, there's something else in this story.  There's something else that was going on at all, I'm going to say.  Did you see the bus at all last night?  Didn't see that bus at all.  And you didn't see anyone from XM?  When I left, no.  Anyone from that party?  There was 100 people at that party.  No.  The sales, I was sitting where all the sales staff and their clients were.  I had left before they did.  I want to get more into this, the bus was full statement you made this morning. 
[01:27:30]  What were you saying that about?  Yesterday, when I got the instructions for getting my ticket and how to get to the game,  they said, do you need to go on the bus because the bus is going to be full?  I'll put your name.  No, I'm going with OK.  Oh, so you were speculating that the XM bus would be full on the way back also.  So you didn't even use that as an option?  No, because I was supposedly going home with Opie.  And then when I realized maybe I could still try to catch the bus, there were no buses.  How did you get home?  Waited on line to get a bus to the Port Authority. 
[01:28:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh, my.  Let me answer this.  What's the worst thing you said as you were standing there muttering to yourself?  Yeah, right.  What's the worst thing that you said?  Oh, I don't know.  I was just, I was so...  I bet it was really bad and really personal and it's about Opie and Ben.  I'm wishing some sort of disease.  Right. 
[01:28:30]  Here's the other thing, though.  You just want a hundred grand.  Cancer of the ass, that fuck.  How long did it take to get a bus?  I waited almost an hour and 20 minutes until I got to the bus.  Oh, my God.  And that's a long hour and 20.  Oh, yeah.  That is a long...  That isn't hanging out with a hot chick hour and 20.  That isn't watching a good movie hour and 20.  That is just looking at your watch every three minutes. 
[01:29:00]  That's humid Meadowlands swamp air and it...  Oh, I...  The day would end like that.  Right.  You win a hundred grand.  You got wristbands for the stones.  At the end of the day, you're standing in a swamp with the common people.  Oh, wait for the New Jersey transit.  Typing text messages to people who you thought were your friends.  I got to be honest with you.  I got to be honest.  I can look anyone in the eye, no problem, even when it gets a little tough.  And Eric's been with us a year now. 
[01:29:30]  I'm having a tough time looking at him this morning.  Yeah, you guys fucked him.  For the first time.  You fucked him.  It gets worse.  All right.  So you waited an hour and a half or an hour and 20 minutes for a poor 30 bus.  Now, you live in Brooklyn.  What time was it when you got on the bus?  Knowing that...  It had to be well after 1 a.m.  Oh, my God.  I was already asleep for a solid two hours.  A solid two hours.  Did you at least get to sit down on the bus or you were standing in the aisle?  I sat down.  Mama! 
[01:30:00]  Oh, God, this is awful.  Before we move on, Crazy Adam says there's a hole in Eric's defense.  Crazy Adam.  Hey, if Ben has a different phone, doesn't the caller ID show the number?  Why couldn't you call the caller ID back?  No, it's a...  Wait.  You said your BlackBerry's a different number, right?  BlackBerry's a Washington number.  Washington number.  Yeah, but a number's a number, man.  I mean, still popping up.  So Eric could have just called that number back, whatever it was. 
[01:30:30]  I don't have that number.  I have his New York number.  But did the number show up on your phone when Ben called you?  And did you really call my phone?  Yes, I called your phone.  Starting at 10.30.  Plus, it's a D.C. area code.  You probably think it's some poor you banged down there in a promotion.  I think the forensic guys there should take a look at his phone.  We need the phone records.  Yeah.  We should have that guy from A&E do the narration.  You know what?  You have this horrible tragedy.  You know what?  Here's the deal.  1 a.m. 
[01:31:00]  I did not bring...  Stranded at the Meadowlands.  I did not bring my phone in.  Did you leave messages?  There were some hang-ups.  I had four voicemails.  Three were hang-ups.  No, one was from Ben because he left something in my car.  Two were hang-ups.  And one was finally you just saying, thanks a lot.  Bro.  Or something like that.  So, I don't have my phone on me.  I could call my house and we could get to the bottom when those calls came in.  Okay.  All right?  And I'll be completely honest.  But I'm telling you, the phone did not ring from 10.30 when we started leaving all the 
[01:31:30]  way until I dropped Ben off and went home.  There are people waiting for buses that aren't there.  Why are they waiting for these buses?  But I will, uh...  You go to the concert with three friends.  You leave with two.  Nothing.  I don't want to talk about it, Larry.  It's awful.  This poor man was standing there and no one would pick him up.  The bus was full.  He had to write, thanks a lot, bro. 
[01:32:00]  We got E-Rock's mind checking in.  E-Rock's mind, what's up?  Worst thing I was thinking that night, it wasn't my pals.  It was that fucking meal ticket comment.  She was just pulling those strings.  Ah, the paycheck.  The paycheck left you there, my friend.  You know what?  That might have played into it a little bit.  Oh, boy.  A seedy story of resentment.  Resentment?  Laying itself out in a swamp in New Jersey.  So, 11.15, you realize... 
[01:32:30]  So, what time did you get on the bus?  1.15, right?  I couldn't tell you.  I know it was well after 1 a.m.  1.15, while Opie slept at home, Eric was just getting on a bus.  What time would he get home?  How would he get home?  Stay tuned.  We'll be back after these words.  So, that is the music.  Very good, Derek.  Very good.  All right.  So, you're on a Port Authority bus back to Manhattan?  Yeah.  Which sucks because you live in Brooklyn.  So, you've got to go all the way back to Manhattan and then take a one-hand. 
[01:33:00]  Now, what happens?  Because the Jersey buses don't take you home to your house in Brooklyn.  No.  So, I get off at the Port Authority.  Then, I've got to go downstairs and around this other area because they're cleaning.  So, they block that off to go to where the taxi line is.  Uh-huh.  All the cabs that are waiting there, going to Jersey, going to Jersey, going to Jersey.  No.  So, I'm in this now another line waiting to get a taxi to try to get back to Brooklyn.  I get tapped.  I turn around.  It's Stalker Patty. 
[01:33:30]  Hi.  What is Stalker Patty doing out in the middle of the night?  Her and those, and a few other people were coming back from some gambling junket in Atlantic  City.  Oh, she's hooked.  So, she's like, what are you doing here?  Waiting for a cab.  Oh, oh, it was nice to see you.  And then she, she left.  So, I'm...  She will pop up everywhere.  It's really creepy.  It's not like it's a small town.  This is frigging...  This is New York City.  And she pops up everywhere.  I finally had to tell her to stop following me on the subway, because she was doing that 
[01:34:00]  for a while.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  When I was still commuting back to Long Island.  She would just happen to be on my subway, and after the third time of her saying, wow,  what a coincidence.  I'm like, Patty, I know what you're doing.  Stop.  Please stop.  Eric, you could hop on the Jitney.  I'm sure the Jitney will take you there.  How is she going to Atlantic City every goddamn weekend on weekdays?  She was getting back from an Atlantic City junket on a Thursday.  Some slot machine tournament. 
[01:34:30]  Get her on the phone.  We gotta hear about the slot machine tournament.  The World Series of Losers tournament.  Like, she's got a headband on.  Like, there's something fucking athletic about it.  Yeah, what kind of tournament is the...  The machines are doing the work.  I don't like this bucket.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Warm-ups are just cracking your knuckles a lot, you know, getting ready.  All right, so what happens?  You're on this line for a cab back to Brooklyn.  What time is it?  It's now 2 a.m.  Oh, it's 2 in the morning.  We gotta be here at, what, 5.30? 
[01:35:00]  Give us one soundbite of something that you said about either one of these two creeps  who just left you there.  Honestly, I said, they're sitting in that car laughing that I'm still out here.  I figured they did it intentionally, because they've done it in a few other places, but  I never thought they would do it in here.  We did it where?  He tried doing it to me in Washington Station.  Well, no, listen, what he wanted to do to you in Washington would have been really bad,  because Ope wanted to report your bags.  You went in the bathroom.  Remember this?  This is when we first went to Washington. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You were going to say that you saw those bags unattended?  Oh, yeah.  There's a history of it.  Yeah, but we all decided that was a bad call.  Very bad.  No, no, no, that's not a good idea.  But we did, I think, didn't we ditch you at the, uh...  He was ditched once before.  Where were we?  We ditched you, whoever?  Yes, we ditched him somewhere.  I'm remembering.  It's like, where's Eric?  We ditched him.  I think it was at the train station in Washington.  Was it a car or a limo or something?  Was it the X Games?  I can't remember where it was,  but there was some point where we were like,  where's Eric? 
[01:36:00]  Fuck him.  I remember that was said.  Patty's on the phone, by the way.  I know, we'll get to Patty in a second.  So, uh...  So now it's after 2 a.m.?  And you have to be...  Why don't you just come back to the station at that point?  You have to be here at 5.30 in the morning.  I was fed up.  So I took a cab back,  took a shower, slept,  and then came back here to work.  How much did that whole trip cost you to come back?  $45.  $45. 
[01:36:30]  Bag of shells, right?  Right, my friend?  You still have $99,955.  That's right.  Don't worry about it.  You don't have $100,000 anymore.  $45,000.  And five hours of your life that you'll never get back.  So what did you do?  Sleep an hour?  I think so.  Like an hour, hour and a half,  got up, and then came to work.  Because I got to tell you, man,  after sleeping six hours,  I feel a little tired today.  Yeah.  I'm just a little tired.  I usually get eight,  but I got six,  so I'm a little groggy today. 
[01:37:00]  My heart pulled for you.  You know,  for a guy who won $100,000,  went to the Stones last night,  he doesn't look that happy, does he?  He's miserable.  That's $100,000.  I'd have been walking home  whistling zippity-doo-dah.  Like, what the fuck?  Yeah, you won $100,000,  you got to see the Rolling Stones,  you know.  Not a bad day.  How much did the ticket cost you  to see the Stones?  Nothing.  Exactly.  As much as we fucked him,  I think there's more to the story  that you're not telling.  Yeah, there's something going on.  There's something else that was going on  that might have distracted you. 
[01:37:30]  Any girls involved in this story  that we don't know about?  No.  No?  Nope.  Come on, you're feeling good,  you made some money,  you want to be a big shot.  No.  You pull out your wad.  Big shot.  No?  No.  I had a great seat.  I had no money there,  so he has to pull out  his scratch-and-match ticket.  I won!  Trying to get the girls  to go with them.  Yeah, didn't the Daily News  give you a t-shirt to wear?  I won.  We got another winner?  I am the winner.  Who's the winner?  Right over here.  Ladies!  One at a time. 
[01:38:00]  All right, let's say hi to Matt  in New Jersey.  Matt, what's going on today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was just calling  and telling you,  Eric, let this die.  If you would have made  Opie late this morning  or had him sleeping late,  you know how pissed off  you would be  for the rest of the day?  Just let it die  and count your thousands  of dollars.  Yeah, it's one of those  sucks-to-be-you  type of things.  All right, why don't you  let the listeners  be the jury.  Yeah.  Jeremy, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Why should we care?  If I couldn't let 
[01:38:30]  Scrooge McDuck here  spend $75,  rent himself a car service  and be home  in 45 minutes.  Exactly.  That's a heartless jury.  That's two for the prosecution.  Do you know you could have  just called the numbers  you hear all the time,  777-77777.  One of those,  and you could have gotten  a town car  to pick you up,  drive you from there  to your door  for probably a little bit more  than you wound up  spending anyway.  Not only that,  I mean, there's plenty  of cars going back.  I've gone and just asked people,  hey, you going back to Manhattan,  can I give you $20 or whatever?  Yeah, you just go up 
[01:39:00]  to the windows of the car  and go, hey,  take me back there.  I'll throw you some money.  Here's my friend.  They take you right back.  That's a whole other side.  You're just saying  what he should do  after they fuck him.  After they fuck him.  Well, it's like, yeah.  You've already been fucked.  Don't take a shower.  Wait till the police.  Examine your privates.  Exactly.  That's what you're saying.  You've got to get the rape kit.  The guy got raped.  You've got to fucking  pull out the rape kit  and take some swabs.  Yeah.  I mean,  you're spinning this off  into another.  I know.  We're talking about 
[01:39:30]  the initial fuck-off.  Right.  I'm at the point  where you're like,  you should go to therapy.  You should try to work.  What a rollercoaster of a day  for the guy, though, man.  Holy crap.  Chuck?  Yeah, you want to go  to some of these phone calls?  Let's go to North Carolina.  Chuck, what's going on?  I was just wondering  if Rosie was on the bus with him.  Hey, this is Eric.  He just won money.  And his friends fucked him  and left him at the concert.  Oh, that horrible movie  Rosie did  where she played the retard?  Did you see that one?  It's classic.  Oh, it's great. 
[01:40:00]  His friends left him  and now he's fucked.  That's exactly how she sounded.  Look at his text.  He's texting something.  Wait a minute.  Fuck off, bro.  Matt, Jersey.  Hey, I just noticed  that I just continued  the streak of good luck  for the show  after Jimmy left, you know?  You guys get lesbians  and now Eric wins $100,000.  What's next?  That is true.  That is true.  We've been on a nice roll  except for the Rolling Stones thing.  Well, that was just for Eric.  The guy,  let's weigh out  the fucking luck here, people.  Let's put it on the scales over here. 
[01:40:30]  You win $100,000.  You had to spend $45  and a couple of hours  getting home from the Stones show.  I think it evens out somewhere.  Not even evens out.  By tomorrow morning  when you wake up  and you get a good night's sleep,  that'll just be  a little nuisance thing.  You still got the $100,000.  Most people would be happy  just to have a free Rolling Stones  to get the tours  completely sold out.  You know,  so you got screwed going back.  You want $100,000 on top of it.  How many people  pitched home from Woodstock, man?  that the prosecution  that the prosecution just admitted 
[01:41:00]  to fucking him over?  I heard that.  I heard that.  He just admitted.  He got screwed.  Eric's not thankful enough  for the fine day he had.  Motivation?  Look at his face.  He's like,  I should be thanking you.  You want $100,000?  Yeah, let's put this on the table.  You want $100,000?  He's establishing motive right now.  Right.  I love this guy.  It was a wonderful VIP party  with free booze and food.  Opie,  are you saying  you want Eric  to say thank you to you?  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Opie is kind of right.  Wait, at any point  did he go into  some sort of convenience store  and you guys hatched his plan?  Let's get him in there.  Actually,  he's...  Getting a Coke?  He doesn't look thankful, does he?  Son of a bitch  wins $100,000.  He should be thanking Anthony.  What did I do?  He got your tickets.  He got your ticket.  Without?  Yes, you did.  Wow.  Yes, you did.  Anthony was offered the tickets.  Yeah, I was.  And he didn't go.  Eric, all I'm asking today  is that...  That could have been me getting fucked.  All I'm asking today  is that you thank me. 
[01:42:00]  That's all.  Wow.  It was a VIP party,  free food,  free food,  really nice Rolling Stones.  Don't do it.  Don't do it, Eric.  If you do that,  I'll beat you with that  fucking microphone.  You had a nice ride  to the venue.  You got a free t-shirt,  a free program.  Let them in your head, Eric.  And I just want to add this  to the pile.  I picked you out of obscurity.  You were just working  for a tiny little station  in the middle of nowhere  in Florida.  You've never officially  thanked me on the air.  That's a baldy move, man. 
[01:42:30]  What do you think?  Can I pick and choose  what I can thank you for?  You know what?  He deserves...  One general thank you.  That's all.  Remember when I was coming  back from Florida  and I met you  in the middle of nowhere  on a...  Okay.  Thank you for the career.  I can't believe it.  You know what, dude?  No.  You fucking deserve  to be left in a swamp.  That's going to be  my greatest accomplishment  ever.  Oh, man.  I can't believe...  I just spent fucking 
[01:43:00]  a half hour defending you  and you turn around  and do that shit.  Thank him.  Who the fuck raised you?  That's the most pathetic  thing I've ever heard  in my life.  They left you  in a fucking swamp.  He doesn't have  a fucking leg  to stand on.  Oh, my God.  And over the air,  you just fucking  genuflect.  You just kissed  his fucking ring.  But I had a lot  of ammo, man.  He never thanked me.  I actually pulled over...  That's unbelievable.  I pulled over  out of what?  What was it?  A cracker barrel?  Unbelievable.  We went to eat  at a cracker barrel  in the middle of nowhere  in the middle of Florida.  That's how I met the kid. 
[01:43:30]  He's me with the cat box,  the garbage,  and the vacuum.  Unbelievable.  Just smiling.  Shoulders slumped.  You are step and fetch it.  How much money  do you need to win  before you get  some fucking spine in you?  You have an F.U.  nest egg right there.  It's F.U. money.  You're a battered woman  sometimes, really.  He didn't mean it.  He didn't mean it.  I know he really cares  deep down.  He didn't even do that.  And he said  he's going to change.  Yeah, he said  you need to thank me.  He smacked him again.  He's been swapping. 
[01:44:00]  He did it.  Not for the swapping.  Eric, Eric,  semantics,  what you thanked him for.  Eric started this morning  going to himself,  oh, I'm going to give him  a piece of my mind.  And by the end of the morning,  he's thanking me.  He had a moment of courage.  Thanks a lot, bro.  Bro.  Finally welled up in him  and you beat him back down.  Now we realize  he was really thanking him.  Thanks a lot, bro.  Oh, wow.  Holy crap.  I don't know what to tell you, man.  I tried to defend you. 
[01:44:30]  Hold on, Manny, what's up?  Well, not that.  I was just thinking about  this whole scratch and match situation.  Yeah.  And I could swear  that Eric was taking  the scratch and match things  out of the show papers  that we get every morning.  Oh, boy.  So, I mean,  and technically,  technically the papers  are delivered to Ben.  And technically,  you ain't getting shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hey, you got a set of balls.  I don't get too mad at that. 
[01:45:00]  Hey, Danny.  What's this world coming to?  Hey.  Danny's going to shoot him.  Yeah, but I'm not asking for any.  I'm not asking for anyone.  I thought you said  spider,  the papers were everyone's spider.  Eric fought back  and everyone stood up.  Come on.  Hey.  Bring it on.  Danny just got a raise.  Was it the papers from here?  No.  That would make a big difference.  I think they better write  another name on that check.  No, one, we don't get  the Sunday Daily News here, too.  I bring them from home.  Ben's saying,  yes, we do get 
[01:45:30]  the Sunday Daily News.  And that Sunday,  we pulled it out.  And didn't we pull out  and realize that those two  were winners  in the Sunday paper  that we got here?  And that made us think,  wow, this really is widespread  because not only did Eric Nagel  say he won,  but the papers from the station  actually won 100 grand.  Oh, wait.  I'll go right over that.  Yeah, that's right.  I'll go right over that.  You know what?  He's right.  We did do that.  Because there were so many winners,  because I was like,  wow, they really did fuck up  because what are the odds  that you're going to win  and the station papers  are going to win?  Now, are you sure 
[01:46:00]  that that was yours?  I'm positive it was mine.  I know exactly what happened.  Oh, Travis knows  exactly what happened.  I came in that day  and I went home after that.  Thank you.  I want to take no chances.  And I brought the story up  and Eric goes,  oh, I have a copy  of the scratchy match  in the studio.  I'll run in  and see if I win.  Oh!  And he scratched it off  and lo and behold,  he won.  And then after the show,  he said,  of course I'm going to mail it in.  Why wouldn't I? 
[01:46:30]  You're saying  that absolutely  the one that he sent in  was from the station's paper?  Absolutely.  No.  Yes.  No.  It was sitting in that bin  that you had over there  for months.  Oh, man.  It was pink.  What do we got,  about 10 people working?  Actually, no, it's perfect.  I want my 10 grand.  10 grand, 10 grand, 10 grand, 10 grand.  10 grand for everybody.  Wow.  Eric, I want you to apologize.  No.  For using one of the station's papers.  Why wouldn't you apologize  for taking food  out of their mouths 
[01:47:00]  is what you're doing?  Because one,  it wasn't a station paper.  Well,  Travis disagrees with that.  station paper.  He can disagree all he wants.  He's not getting any money.  Let's get a lawyer.  This would make for great radio, man.  Let's sue one of our own.  I think they deserve  to share in this.  Make us spend  80 grand of the winnings  on defense.  Oh, Jesus.  He would, too.  Eric,  if you just get...  See, I'm thinking  I don't know.  I should get...  There's 10 of us, right?  I should get 10,000.  You give me 1,000, 
[01:47:30]  and I won't sue you.  No.  You want to settle it?  Just settle out?  I'll just settle out.  What do you think  about settling out  with everybody?  A grand for everyone.  That's nothing, really.  10 grand out of 100 grand?  I would have done it anyway.  You've got to do something.  He's just to be a decent guy.  How about a nice,  like, lunch for everybody?  Something.  Yeah, I offered that  to all of them yesterday.  I said I was going to  take them out  to lunch and dinner.  But now you don't want  to take them out  because they just  threw you under a bus.  I didn't throw you  under a bus.  Those guys did.  That was one of the  first things I said. 
[01:48:00]  By leaving his ass  in the swamp,  somehow it ends up  with you apologizing to him.  I've never fucking seen it.  Unbelievable.  I really can't believe  that they would throw you  under a bus like that.  You know?  I would never do that to you.  Where are you  taking him to lunch?  What happened  five minutes ago?  Would you guys  accept lunch from him?  No, they're all  shaking their heads.  They don't want it.  Wow.  They don't want it.  Let's see.  Which way? 
[01:48:30]  Let's say hi to  does Eric have a car?  I guess we're done.  What are you going to do  with the 100 grand?  What do you got?  Any plans?  Just going to invest it.  Invest it.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What are you investing in?  Not sure yet.  I'm working on that.  Citadel stock.  Yeah, you want to buy  some Citadel?  Yeah, I'll give you  my Citadel stock.  Something safe?  Something long-term  or a little risky  to make money quickly on?  Something long-term,  I think.  Yeah.  You want mutual funds?  Blue chips. 
[01:49:00]  Let's have you talk  to that tough guy,  Barry Shapiro.  Guy that packs  a mean punch.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right, we'll talk  to Stalker Patty  after the break, I guess.  About her Atlantic City  junket.  I think she's really  getting addicted  to the gambling thing.  She needs to be going  all the time.  I'm glad we cleared  this up, Eric.  And your apology  is accepted.  Yeah, I'll accept  your apology.  All's well now. 
[01:49:30]  I like how he's  sitting there  thinking it over.  How the fuck  did that happen?  I was so right.  So right,  yet he  apologized.  He apologized.  And thanked someone  for his career.  He still has  fucking dirt  on his knees  from that swamp.  The swamp.  He left him  at a swamp.  Oh, you know what?  Never seen anything  like this.  That's the end of any.  Thanks, mate.  All right, we better  take a break.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, there was a time  we gave away  $100,000.  Yes!  We haven't played  this thing in a while,  Anthony.  A lot of new listeners.  We were at a radio station  in the Boston area.  And one day,  we decided to give away  $100,000.  And here's the winning  phone call.  Check it out.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Craig  from Waltham.  Hey, Craig, guess what?  Oh, did I win?  You are the 107th caller.  Get out of the way!  Tell me, I won!  I won!  I won! 
[01:50:30]  You're kidding, right?  107th.  Oh, wow!  107th caller,  congratulations.  100 grand!  Oh, my God!  You just won  100 grand, bro.  Oh, Jesus!  Do you know  what I'm going to do  with that?  What are you going  to do with the 100 grand?  Oh, man, the first thing,  I have this old...  Oh, I cannot...  Jesus, I've got to calm...  Calm down.  Calm yourself.  I am the winner!  I'm the winner!  Well, what are you  going to do  with 100 grand, bro?  I got this...  Oh, man,  I got this  box for a truck.  I've got to get a new one!  A new truck...  Oh, that...  Oh.  Wait, wait, dude,  how are you going to do that  with a candy bar? 
[01:51:00]  What?  How are you going to do  that with a candy bar?  We just gave you  a 100 grand candy bar.  What do you mean?  We gave away  100 grand.  It's a candy bar, bro.  Congratulations!  What?  You just won a candy bar.  Hey!  What the f***?  You've been...  I've been listening  to f***ing radio  for like three hours, man!  You said 100 grand!  Yeah, 100 grand.  We gave you a candy bar.  Congratulations, buddy, buddy!  You guys are a bunch  of douchebags!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Congratulations, man! 
[01:51:30]  Uh-oh.  Like sand  through the hourglass,  so is the ONA virus.  Well, Jimmy,  now you're not  going to like this.  I'm sure I won't.  This, uh,  you like the big labia,  and it says in some cases  large labia  can create hygiene problems  or affect sexual function.  Now, here's the hygiene problems  they're talking about,  these rookies.  That when she tinkles,  sometimes a little tinkle  gets caught up in there  and stays.  Yeah.  And let me tell you,  that makes  for a lovely aroma. 
[01:52:00]  A lovely,  wafting aroma.  You are something else,  my friend.  And he's not even  making a joke.  You like it a little dirty.  No.  No, that's...  No, because that's called dirty.  No, no, no.  Dirty to me...  It's not like she's  picking up a steel with it.  If it gets dirty,  it's because of whiz.  Now, there's a dirty sweat  that's...  There's an unhygienic...  There is a difference  between being  a slight musk  that is  just a natural thing  and being dirty.  There's a dirty smell  and there's a sexy smell.  Believe me,  I don't like dirty.  I don't like a filthy, 
[01:52:30]  awful person.  If they're getting caught  in the labia, though.  Tinkle?  When tinkle gets trapped  in there?  For how long,  would you say?  Maybe a week.  A week?  Nah, you know,  just from that morning.  I would always tell girlfriends  who I was dating,  do not shower  right before you come over.  I don't want to talk to you.  See, because you like it  a little dirty?  Shower that day, though.  That's considered a little dirty.  Shower that day.  I don't like a girl  to go three days  without a shower.  Go to work  and then come over  and, you know,  you like that.  Yeah, but you got to  shower that morning.  I'm not that earthy. 
[01:53:00]  What do you have?  I don't know.  Speaking of earthy.  Yeah.  They also can get it  caught in undergarments  and make it difficult  to wear tight pants  or tiny bikinis.  Right.  Tiny bikinis.  Oh, I love it.  The knuckle  or if you've seen  the camel toe  or sometimes  the bikini  just gets caught up  in there  and it comes out the side.  I fucking salivate  for that.  By the way,  what does it get  caught in clothes?  What are you constantly  in buildings  that are on fire  at three o'clock  in the morning? 
[01:53:30]  How fast do you  have to get dressed?  If you're zipping  your labia up,  perhaps you do  need this procedure.  Perhaps you need  to email  yellowtreats  at AOL.com.  You have a dinner  coming, sweetie.  Toby and Anthony.  The virus  is spreading.  So be it  Fred no more  Let the cute pieces  to prepare for  So be it  Settle the door 
[01:54:00]  Touch me again  with the words  that you will hear evermore  Bravo.  Great job, Eric.  Now go get  your fucking shine box.  Metallica.  Dane Cook  coming in  at 9.30  I believe.  I don't think  he's ever done  our show in studio.  Not live, no.  Just funners.  We've had a couple  phone calls 
[01:54:30]  from him over the years.  He's blowing up  big time.  Bill Burr  also blowing up.  I think he's made  probably $100,000  off of his  record sales.  Yeah, maybe $100,000.  Bill Burr  is going to be  on HBO  tonight at midnight.  Half hour  comedy special.  I'll watch that one  for sure.  On HBO.  He's a very funny guy  but I'm not going  to really push it anymore  because he wasn't  on my side  during that last break.  It was just such  a gang mentality.  No one was. 
[01:55:00]  Someone had to defend it.  That's what happens  on the show though.  And I did  up until the apology.  No one comes  to your side  on the show.  You fuck up.  Everyone attacks.  Everybody.  Everyone.  All right.  Felt bad for him.  Oh, well...  Is this true?  What?  That some of the  FEMA debit cards  that they handed out  are now  found they were  being used  at a strip club.  Nice.  At a gentleman's club.  Bravo.  Oh, that's fantastic. 
[01:55:30]  Because you're giving  these things out  to people that  don't have much  responsibility  to begin with.  Right.  All of a sudden  they're going to  change their lives  and go,  hey, let's put  this money to good use.  That's great.  They're really  saying that though?  Yeah.  You can stand  on the side  of the road,  I swear to God,  with some sort of  bin and some sort  of official looking  thing and just say  New Orleans relief  and idiots will come  up and put cash in it.  Yeah.  You'll make some money.  Sure.  I'm sure it's happening.  There's always scammers.  There's more scams 
[01:56:00]  than actual charities.  Yeah.  They said that there's  like 20 websites out there.  Yeah.  All phony.  People trying to get  immediately,  who gets KatrinaAid.com  or something?  You think it's legitimate  or you think it's  just some guy?  You know what?  This still,  as dirtbag as that is,  there's something  just fucking hilarious.  You know they're  giggling like  fucking third graders  when they're  setting the thing up.  Yeah.  Do you believe  we're going to  fucking do this?  The money's going  to pour in.  Just sitting there  on the phone.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:56:30]  I feel bad  for the victims too.  Look at all your  face.  All right.  Let's see.  Oh, we want to talk  to Stalker Patty.  Yeah, I want to know  what she's doing.  During Eric's adventure  last night,  he ended up on a,  I don't know,  a taxi line  at 2 in the morning  and Stalker Patty  was behind you.  Right?  Yeah.  Something like that.  And we got Stalker Patty  on the phone.  Stalker Patty.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  Now, you saw Eric? 
[01:57:00]  Yes, I did.  He was on a taxi stand  at about 10 to 1  in the morning.  I was just getting  off the bus.  You were just  getting off the bus?  Yeah, I went to  Atlantic City  because I got invited  to a slot tournament.  I go about once a month  because it's something  to do.  Slot tournament.  What's a slot tournament?  You bring a card,  you hand it in,  you get taken  to a machine,  you have seven minutes  to play,  and whoever has  the 50 highest scores  cashes. 
[01:57:30]  I never win.  I only had 4,400.  The lowest score  was like 7,000.  I guess it's just  luck of the draw.  It's a slot machine.  Yeah, there's no  skill involved.  Yeah, so I went  down there for it,  and then I just  hung around.  And I won about $75,  so that was nice.  Oh, you're up?  That's my big win.  How does she win?  How does anyone  win at the slots?  I don't know.  What do you play,  the nickel?  I do the quarter ones.  Ooh. 
[01:58:00]  You're living, huh?  You're living.  Sometimes the penny  ones I like,  you know.  I can't afford  to do the others.  Patty, you can't  afford to go there.  You should be saving  those quarters for food.  Yeah, but if I didn't  do that, I'd be  sitting home doing  nothing.  I don't go anywhere.  I don't really have  a social life, so it's  just something.  Really?  This is the other  side of gambling  they don't want  you to know about,  you know?  This woman needs  every penny she can  take.  These are the kinds  of people who show 
[01:58:30]  up to the comedy  show after they're  out of pennies or  nickels, and just  sitting there with  slumped shoulders.  Yeah, because they  have two hours to  kill before the bus  takes them back to  the city.  Yeah.  You know, I go on  the boardwalk, too.  It's the only time  I see the ocean.  Jump in it.  No, I just like  going there just for  something to do, and  I like the ocean.  I like the ride down  and back.  I don't do very much  with the machines.  I like watching the  people do the tapes  because they look  kind of funny to me  when they act like  when they win and 
[01:59:00]  stuff.  I'll be so right.  This is the side  they don't want you  to see.  They want you to  see the glamour, the  world series of poker  with the guys, let's  bring out the million  dollars and put it on  the table, and these  last two people are  going to be playing for  a million dollars cash,  and there's Patty  throwing her quarters  best spent on food  in this slot machine  after taking a stinky  bus ride with a bunch  of Asians.  I don't have anything  better to do.  No, there's a bunch  of old people.  Old people.  Yeah, I don't mind it.  I ended up in Vegas  with Stephen Lynch's  crew when I was just  wandering around the 
[01:59:30]  country.  I took a ride from  L.A. to Vegas  through the desert  and stuff with a bunch  of L.A. dudes that  looked like they were  in Stone Temple Pilots.  They all looked like  rock stars even though  they just worked at  like a Starbucks, and  we're there for Stephen  Lynch.  He was playing, I guess  it was the hard rock  at the time, and all  of a sudden these guys,  I was hanging out with  them all week, and  they're like, you want  to see the real Vegas?  I'm like, yeah.  Two, maybe three blocks  from all the glam and  glitter.  Holy shit. 
[02:00:00]  And it's right there.  It's not that far from  the strip.  Yeah.  Places where they say  they'll accept your car  title and your house  title for loans.  Oh, shit.  Right off the strip,  saying, you know, we  will accept whatever it  is, your house, what is  it called?  And you know, yeah,  your deed.  And your deed, and  then there's motels that  are for like, I don't  know, like $10, no joke,  like $10 a night, and  you've got people just  wandering around, just  like they lost it all.  I like the slot machines  and the gas stations. 
[02:00:30]  Like, who can't get  away?  You know, you're  either, you're leaving,  you want to fill up your  tank and leave.  Who needs that one last  pull or something, you  know?  Right.  No, it's even worse if  you win, because then  you're turning your  fucking car back.  How are you going,  man?  Here we go, I'm on a  streak.  Or you stay at the  gas station.  This machine's hot.  Right.  Sir, at least move your  car away from the pump.  No, I walk away, I  jinx myself.  Yeah, I can't leave.  Keep the car, I'm up  75.  I don't know how  anyone, you know, lives  in Vegas, because when 
[02:01:00]  you go there, you get  just pulled into it,  obviously.  You really do.  But when you're living  there, and these slot  machines are in grocery  stores, the Starbucks, the  gas stations, I don't  know.  How many times have you  gotten a cab driver out  there, and he's got a  story?  Oh, they all do,  yep.  Oh, yeah, they all  fucking, oh, yeah, I  stay out of those places.  Everyone that works  there is like, no, I  don't gamble at all.  I stay away from it.  No drinking.  They're all born-again  Christians.  Yeah.  I think they sold  themselves into some  sort of slavery out  there.  It was like the last  roll of the dice to the 
[02:01:30]  cab company.  Yeah, it's some kind of  slave labor.  You know, I wasn't going  to go there.  I did notice something  during Starker Patty's  phone call.  She's still on the line,  by the way.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to go  there, but the phones  are going nuts.  They really are.  There's like five people  that have the same  comment.  Larry, go ahead.  Hey, did anybody catch  what happened there  just then?  He said, Eric, that he  didn't get on the, he  didn't leave the bus  the way after one, yet  Starker Patty said she  saw him at the taxi  stand at 10 to 1. 
[02:02:00]  Patty.  Patty.  Starker Patty.  Yes.  It was about 10 to 1,  because that's when I  got off the bus and came  up outside, and I saw  him there.  See, she's crazy.  She knows time.  Yeah, crazy people are,  they know the time  all the time.  She knows every time  she does everything.  She's like anal like  that.  She knows.  So if she says that  she saw you at 10 to 1,  it was 10 to 1.  Big hole in the story  there.  He's like the third  person in line.  Did he look happy?  He looked kind of  like tired. 
[02:02:30]  That would be the  look.  Imbibing.  I think he imbibed  a little too much.  Imbibed.  Alright, well, there  you have it.  Imbibed some arsenic.  Thanks, guys.  Fuck it out.  Thanks, Larry.  So Stark and Patty  went down to where  Atlantic City, and you  played the slots in  some dumb tournament.  Anything else happen  down there?  No, I just had my  dinner and just went  to the boardwalk,  went to my favorite  deli, because it's the  one with all the  dollabins all over the  counter and cash 
[02:03:00]  registers, so it's  kind of cool, so I  like to have coffee in  there because the  place looks cool.  I saw the water and  went into some of the  99-cent shops and  stuff like that.  If this was on TV,  there'd be a  sponsorship number  underneath her.  Did you hear her?  This is just so sad.  I can't even make  fun of her.  This is just sad.  I'm just wandering  around the boardwalk  all alone.  Money on the  counter.  You hear the last  part?  I like it.  She says she walks  into the 99-cent  stores.  Yeah, they're all  over the boardwalk.  They're right there.  Did you buy anything? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, I just got a  little top to keep  warm inside the  casino because I  forgot to bring  something with me.  It was like $4.99,  you know.  $4.99 at the  99-cent store.  And did it say  anything on it?  Yeah, it just said  Atlantic City  Athletic Department.  Athletic Department.  Oh, she's got the  body of an ant.  I was going to say  I should have said  Atlantic City Ant Farm.  Athletic Department.  Great.  And were you alone?  Yes, I was. 
[02:04:00]  Sitting in that  diner with the  dollar bills on the  counter, drinking her  cup of coffee, just  staring off of their  thoughts.  Yeah, what do you  dream about when  you're in that  situation?  Yeah, what is your  mind?  Where does it go?  What if I was one  of the lucky ones  that hit the jackpot  or a thousand or  something?  A thousand?  She's just looking  for a grand.  What if the money  on the counter was  real?  What did I do with  the slot tournament?  I got a check about  8.30 tonight when  they're posting it.  I had to run back  to Caesars and go  look at the list.  Of course, I wasn't  on it. 
[02:04:30]  The lowest person  was $7,000 and I  only hit $44,000.  Patty, do you  start thinking about  what you would  spend the money on?  If I won?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I just put it in  the bank until I  decided what to do.  What is the...  Just take care of  something, maybe get  a bigger place to  live or something.  What's like the  one materialistic  thing you want?  What is like the  dream item that  you really want to  buy that you'll  never think you  can afford? 
[02:05:00]  The one item.  Well, I'm already  getting it, so I'm  happy.  What?  My friend's going  to give me his  old computer and  I'm going to get  to watch his dog  for about three  months free, you  know, when he  goes away.  That's not a...  That's a dream  I did to me.  Can I take a  break?  This is like  depressing me.  Isn't it depressing?  But it's not  depressing to her.  She doesn't  understand how  sad this is.  To her, this is  great.  This segment  brought to you 
[02:05:30]  by Paxil.  You know, but  you know what I  would like a  portable DVD player  to watch a movie  on a bus or  something or sit  in Central Park  and watch a  re-run set.  Reruns of the  old Lawrence Welk  show.  Make it even  more depressing.  I'm getting  the box set.  Patty, so a  portable DVD  player?  Yeah, that  would be one of  my dream items.  That's one of  your dream items?  Yeah, but it's  like $400 for one  and you know you  can't spend $400 for  one of them.  Well, Patty, we  can make your 
[02:06:00]  dreams come true.  That's right.  We're the dream  makers over here.  There's a new  show hitting TV  where they make  dreams come true.  Yeah.  Which, quite  frankly, it's  bad timing  considering what  happened with  Hurricane Katrina  and now they're  doing these stupid  dreams on TV  that people are  hoping for.  The dreams are  all small.  I want socks.  Yeah, right.  You know, the  dream is to have  not like a  one-room place  but like a  two or three-room  apartment.  I can have my  study in one  room, my 
[02:06:30]  bedroom in the  other room.  You know what  I mean?  A bigger apartment  would be a  dream.  I'm a millionaire  and I don't  have a study.  A study.  All right,  Sherlock Holmes.  Who has a  study?  Studies?  I believe she's  in the study.  Please follow  me, sir.  That's what  it feels.  You've got to  open two doors.  You can never  just do the  one.  It's all dark  wood in there  with books all  over.  What would  you have?  A fucking  raven.  Raven.  I like  reading.  A suit of  armor in the 
[02:07:00]  corner.  I'm going to  teach myself  family.  And a buffalo  head.  You're meant  to the study.  What would  you have in  your study?  Well, I'd  move my stereo  in there,  my little  stuff, my  music, whatever.  I'd have my  albums all on  one wall.  Who are some  of your favorite  albums?  Yeah.  If you could  listen to an  album, right?  My Bob Dylan  ones, and my  treasures.  My treasures.  All my books  would be on  another shelf, and 
[02:07:30]  I love reading.  things like that.  What's your  favorite book,  Patty?  Oh, God.  I like the  classics.  I'm embarrassed  to say what it  is, but I  enjoy Five  Little Peppers  and how they  grow.  I enjoy books  on life sciences  and biology and  stuff like that.  I like reading a  little bit about  Isaac Asimov,  you know.  Asimov?  Yeah, Asimov.  Isaac Asimov.  Asimov?  He wrote about 
[02:08:00]  like 200 books  on science,  behavioral,  science,  psychology,  science fiction,  that's what her  study looks like.  Novels.  Well, Patty,  what would you  do for a DVD  player?  Because, Patty,  I have a  used DVD  player.  Used?  To go with  your used  computer.  Yeah, Patty.  What would you  do for a DVD  player?  I don't know.  I'll go down 
[02:08:30]  on the beach  there and do  a well-sister  stop.  No, no,  that's not  what we have  in mind.  What would you  have in mind?  It has to be  something humiliating,  you know that.  She's already  trotted around  on her hands  and knees  naked with a  Krusty the  Clown mask on.  What more  could she  possibly do?  I know.  She's got to  dump that virginity  is what she's  got to do.  Yeah, if you  dump that virginity,  you could have  my used DVD 
[02:09:00]  player.  Did you go  out on a date  with Big A  yet?  No, not yet.  Are you going  to?  Oh, I don't  know.  I mean, I do  see him sometimes  around, you  know, sociably,  you know, like I  see him around.  Do you like the  Big A?  He's very nice.  He's a very  nice fellow.  Oh, there might  be a little love  connection.  Ah, a little  action in the  study.  What do you  think, Patty?  Is there a little  spark there on 
[02:09:30]  your part?  You know, I  don't know.  I mean...  Breaking news for  all whack  baggers.  Stalker Patty  likes Big A.  Ah, start the  photoshops.  Start the  photoshops.  It was Big A in  the study with his  cock.  Let's get Big A  on the line.  How do we get  a hold of Big A  today?  Does he listen  every day?  I want to see if  Big A likes  Stalker Patty.  Yeah, I'm sure  he's a...  Somebody's got to  bring some  excitement to  this woman's  life.  This would be  a mess.  Do you see  what excites  her?  Sitting in a 
[02:10:00]  diner with  dollar bills on  the counter,  probably underneath.  What are they  underneath?  Some kind of  plastic or  something?  Patty?  Yes, well,  they're hanging  up on the wall  and everything.  They're kind of  shellacked and  some of them  are kind of  loose and  hanging up.  I asked the  guy, you don't  think somebody  would come in  here and go  plink, plank,  plunk, and  he says, oh  no, never had a  problem.  Starts stealing  dollars.  What does  plink, plank,  plunk mean?  It's the  universal sound  of pulling  dollars off the  wall.  He says, no,  they've never  had that  situation.  Even grabbing 
[02:10:30]  money in her  world sounds  depressing.  Yeah, plink,  plank, plunk.  And then you  sit there and  she drinks her  coffee and  that to her is  a real good  time.  That's a real  good time.  But you make  sure you don't  miss the bus,  right?  Oh, yeah, I  have a certain  time because I  got to work this  morning.  You know exactly  where you're  supposed to be  in order to get  home so you're  not stranded  there, right?  Right.  I just stick to  a certain bus  schedule and  that's it.  Tonight I'm  going to come  home on this  one and that's  it and I'm  there.  It would be  real stupid to 
[02:11:00]  not know how  to get home and  be stranded  somewhere.  Yeah.  I know.  Well, I'm the  type of a person  that might have  an on-star in  my head because  no matter where  you put me  anywhere in the  country, in a  place I've never  been before, I  always think to  navigate my way  back to where  I'm going.  Yeah.  Like an ant with  a leaf in her  mouth.  She knows where  the hole is.  All right, we  should get Big  A on the phone.  I want to see if  there's something  going on here  because Stalker  Patty is kind of  leaving the door  open.  Like there could  be something  there.  I mean, I'm  open to wall  dates.  I really am 
[02:11:30]  with anybody  because you  got to get to  know people and  I don't think I  know enough  people.  You don't.  You don't know  anybody.  As far as  attractions or  anything, I just  don't have any  right now.  You're afraid of  intimacy.  You've gone 50  years with no  attractions.  Stop it.  Get it over with  already.  Have sex.  All right, we'll  have to get  Big A on the  line here, okay?  Isn't that weird?  She likes hanging  out in the  diners like that  and drinking her  coffee, Brooklyn  Diner, this  diner in Atlantic 
[02:12:00]  City, and she  was left as a  child on the  counter in a  diner.  Isn't that odd?  Yeah.  When she was an  infant, her mother  put her in a  basket and put her  on the counter of  a diner and just  walked out.  No wonder she  reads the  classics.  That sounds like  the beginning of  it was the best  of times.  It was the worst  of times.  She was raised  in the foundling  home.  Foundling home.  She was a  foundling.  Doesn't that  sound like  something out of  The Little  Rascals? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, I know.  Who has a  foundling home?  Apparently New  York does.  All right, Patty.  Well, someone's  on the hotline.  Who's on the  hotline?  Oh, okay.  Who's on 11?  Who's this?  Hello, 11?  Line 11?  Hello?  Come in 11.  11?  Hello?  Anyone there?  K to K12 to  K to K1.  All right, I  don't know what's  going on.  Okay. 
[02:13:00]  I guess we  can take a break  and then regroup  that.  See if they can  get to Big A.  The Big A?  I saw him  outside the  building like  twice so far.  That's not  the dude  missing the  toe, is it?  Right, Derek?  No, Pat from  Monaki is so  old.  His 15 minutes  ran up with  our new guy  is Big A.  Big A.  Andrew.  He's a very  big guy, a  little scary,  and he drives  a taxi.  It's not even  a taxi.  It's like he  took his car  and he just 
[02:13:30]  drives around  picking people  up in the  Bronx.  And that's  what he does.  And he gets  very nervous  and he's got  kind of a  speech problem.  So he kind  of stutters a  little, but  in between  him trying to  find the words,  I know.  They just  fucking call  in?  In between  trying to  find his  words, he  goes like,  Willow,  Drive,  and Stucker  Patty's  interested.  And he has  problems with  words that  start with  S-T.  He'll go  like, I  was walking  up the 
[02:14:00]  stairs.  It's just  frightening.  This is how  we discovered  him.  He was  outside the  station one  day.  We were  doing  something.  Oh, we  have a  clip?  Yeah, this  is the  first time  he was  ever on  our show.  All of a  sudden, we  just talked  to the  guy.  Listen to  this.  You  going on  the ride  today?  Actually, I  just came  down here  to take  some photos  of everybody  and to  post on  whackbag.com. 
[02:14:30]  How come  you're not  going on  the ride?  I didn't  plan it.  Go down.  It's not  too late.  Tag along.  I don't  know who  I could  tag along  or not,  but I'm  just hanging  with  too late.  Jesus  Christ.  Fill in  their  date.  You'll  win a  prize at  an  independent  film  festival.  Those  actors  were  brilliant. 
[02:15:00]  So  believable.  Winning  awards at  Sundance  this year.  I love  you.  All right,  here we  go.  We  stalled  enough.  We  got Big  A on  the  line.  Big  A.  Yes.  Hey,  Big  A.  What's  going  on?  Where  are  you  right  now?  Are  you  having  trouble  getting  around  the  city  with  the  U.N.  thing  happening?  Not  too much. 
[02:15:30]  No,  because you  keep it  uptown,  right?  Yeah.  that car  you drive  doesn't  look like  it belongs  to any  company or  anything.  Right.  And  you're  kind of  scary  looking.  I mean,  who the  hell is  taking a  ride from  you?  Anybody  who calls  Target.  I mean,  my company.  It  actually,  it's a  company,  a real  company?  Yeah,  it is a real  company,  yes.  And you  had to  buy the 
[02:16:00]  car  yourself?  No,  it's a  company  car,  actually.  Wow.  You know  what he  looks like,  by the  way?  I don't  want to  know.  Remember  when Danny  DeVito  played the  penguin in  Batman?  Oh,  a little  bit.  That's  exactly what  he looks  like,  man.  I gotta  go.  I have  to get  ready while  I'm on  the phone.  Stark or  Patty,  what's  going on?  Stark or  Patty?  Yes?  Did you  have to  go?  No,  no,  no.  I was  just getting  ready to  walk out  the door.  I got  ready while  I was 
[02:16:30]  on the  phone.  All  right.  Big A.  Yes?  We just  want to  know if  you might  have a  little  interest  in  Stark or  Patty.  Yeah,  I do  actually.  She's  very nice.  Were you  two hanging  out at  the  B.B.  King's  appearance?  Yeah,  I saw  her at  the B.B.  King's  and I  had breakfast  with her  yesterday  at the  Brooklyn  Diner.  Oh,  you had  breakfast  with her  at the  Brooklyn  Diner  yesterday.  that's 
[02:17:00]  nice.  Now,  Stalker  Patty's  a 50  year old  virgin.  Big A,  we never  asked how  old you  were.  Um,  I'm  38.  38.  Patty,  younger  man,  huh?  Patty's  got a  boy toy.  Well,  I'm not  Cher,  so I  don't  believe  in  boy  toys.  All  right,  well,  Big A,  are you  going to  pop the  question  and ask  her out  on a 
[02:17:30]  real  date  or  what?  Um,  um,  Patty,  would you  like to  go out  sometime?  Sure,  I'd be  happy to  go on  a date.  We  got a  love  connection.  Yeah,  go out  on a  date.  This  is big  news for  the show,  you guys.  Huge  news.  Now,  Big A,  where would  you be  taking  the  likes  of  Stalker  Patty  for a  date? 
[02:18:00]  Take  it to  a  diner.  Yeah,  yeah,  where?  You  want to  go to  Paisano  of  Mulberry  Street,  the  heart  of  Little  Little  Lake?  Oh,  definitely,  yeah.  The San  Gennaro  feast is  going on,  I do  believe.  They're  closing  down  all the  streets  down  there.  That's  right.  Some  nice  Italian  food.  Hey,  Big A,  when was  the last  time you  got laid,  by the  way?  Um,  about  two years  ago,  at least.  Stalker  Patty,  you all  right with 
[02:18:30]  that?  His  sexual  history?  Sounds  like a  slut to  me.  Are you  hanging with  someone so  experienced?  I'm really  down for a  day.  You have  to excuse  me,  I'm out  in the  hallway  getting on  the elevator.  The  hallway  of what,  Rikers?  No,  they're just  fixing something  in the  hallway.  The  elevator's  here.  It'll be  quieter in  a second.  What is  that  banging?  There's  that thing  coming up  the stairs. 
[02:19:00]  I'm  showing  Bill  Burr  what  Big A  looks  like.  Oh,  my  God.  Does  that  double  chin  quiver  when he  goes,  yes,  it does.  He  looks happy  though.  He's a  happy guy.  He was  waving to  all his  fans as  he was  going into  the  BB  King's  appearance,  the  Ron  of  Fez.  That  picture's  cropped  too much  though.  It doesn't  show the  sweat under  that armpit  that he's  holding up.  You were a  little nervous  that day. 
[02:19:30]  I noticed  you sweating  a lot,  Big A.  Breaking news  on the  Opie and  Anthony  show.  Big A  has asked  Stalker  Patty out  on a  date.  Do we  have a  day we  can do  this to  send them  to Paisano's  of Mulberry  Street?  Stalker  Patty,  well,  Big A,  you better  ask her.  I can't  do the  dirty work  for you.  Get to  know when  she's free  and  everything.  Go ahead.  Hey,  Patty,  it's a  good thing  so I can  take you  out at  Paisano's. 
[02:20:00]  That would  be nice.  I'm free  anytime.  Just let me  know when.  No problem.  I'll call you  on your  cell phone.  Okay.  Close the deal,  man.  Get a date.  Close the deal.  Let's go.  Yeah,  what day?  What day,  man?  And call  her Stalker  Patty.  That's her  real name  as far as  the show  goes.  I loved  this scene  when it  was in  The Other  Sister.  How about  on Thursday?  My day  off.  Okay.  Sounds 
[02:20:30]  good,  huh?  We'll do  a Thursday.  What time?  What time?  Yeah,  what time?  Well,  what time  would you like  me to be  there or  meet you?  I don't know,  4 o'clock.  5 o'clock?  You'd be  fine.  4?  For a  date?  A dinner  date at  4 o'clock?  4 o'clock?  That's  probably  4 o'clock.  You're going  into dinner  hour anyway.  We're both  yapping over  each other.  I know.  Could you 
[02:21:00]  guys come  in Thursday,  the day  of your  date?  Sure.  Both of  you guys  come in  Thursday in  studio?  Of course  we can.  But it  looks like  we have  a date.  Big A  is going  to go  out with  Stalker  Patty this  Thursday at  Paisano's of  Mulberry Street  in the heart  of Little  Italy.  You want  us to  bring a  chaperone  to maybe  get some  audio?  We're going  to need a  chaperone  just for a  little while  and then  we'll let  you two  lovebirds  have some  fun.  All right.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  This is going  to be the  most horrific  thing to  happen in  an Italian  restaurant  since Michael  shot  Salazzo  in the  Fusca.  Let Nathaniel  go with  him and  record it.  Nathaniel,  you want  in?  All right.  Nathaniel's  going to  chaperone  the big  date between  Big A  and Stalker  Patty.  Oh, yeah.  We need the  camera to go.  We should  duct tape  some condoms  up behind  the toilet  for him to  go into  at the end  of the day.  Can I  use the  bathroom?  Why not?  Big A, any 
[02:22:00]  final words to  Stalker  Patty?  I guess I'll  see you on  Thursday.  Okay, no  problem.  Just give me  a call.  Okay, I'll  see you there  at the studio.  Okay.  Are we going to  meet here?  Are we going to  supply him with  transportation and  stuff?  Oh, fuck no.  Oh, come on.  We'll get him a  free dinner.  I'm sure Joey will  give him a free  meal.  Joey will hook  him up.  But what, are  they going to  take a cab down  there?  Yeah.  And then, uh,  wait a minute. 
[02:22:30]  What about the  video?  I'll pay for that  cab.  Wow.  Hey, Bill.  There you go, huh?  Now, I would  like for Than, if  Than's going, if we  could have them in  the back of the cab,  right?  Get in here, Nathaniel.  Nathaniel?  How about we get  a big responsibility?  Can we pay one of  those bike guys to  bike him down?  That's a long bike  ride.  What are they  called?  They don't go that  far?  What are they  called?  Rim?  Oh, yeah, one of  those rickshaw  guys.  Rickshaw, yeah.  No, that's too  far.  It's kind of  romantic.  Romantic from 
[02:23:00]  here to there.  They can talk.  Nathaniel's in  studio, Ant.  I was thinking,  Nathaniel, if you  take a cab with  these guys, you're  going to have to  sit in the front  seat and turn the  camera around so it  looks like taxi cab  confessions a little  bit.  Okay.  And just have them  two sitting in the  back seat so you're  not there kind of  mixing things up and  just get their natural  taxi cab conversations.  Okay.  Right.  Sounds good.  Yeah.  All right, so  here's the deal.  Nathaniel will  shout out on Big  Gang Installer. 
[02:23:30]  I didn't call you  in, friend.  I knew you.  Well, I thought he  might have something  else to add to the  goddamn thing.  It'll be funny.  Good idea.  Thank you, sir.  And they'll come in  studio Thursday  morning so we can  set up the date a  little bit and later  that night they'll go  down to Paisano and  Mulberry Street in the  heart of Little Italy.  All right?  All right, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Hello?  Yeah, great.  All right.  Have fun.  We'll see you Thursday.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Take care, everyone. 
[02:24:00]  See you Thursday.  All right.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Big A.  That guy's Radio Gold,  I'm telling you right  now.  And Stalker Patty, who  has been Radio Gold for  many years for us.  This just in Paisano's  standing room only this  Thursday.  I'm sure a few listeners  will probably go down  there and join them for  their romantic little  meal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now they know the  time, the place, the  dates.  It's going to turn into  an open-ended.  And now we won't be able  to get a reservation.  Fucker!  Fucker!  All right.  What's you're going to 
[02:24:30]  hear?  All right.  Yeah.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  It's going to turn into  the accused.  He's got a fucker right  there!  He's got a fucker!  Hey, frat boy, you're next!  Paisano of Mulberry Street in  the heart of Little Italy.  The San Gennaro Feast is  going on, I believe.  One of the best times of  the year to go down there.  The fall in Little Italy,  it's a great combination.  That's right.  And you know how crowded  it is down there?  You walk down the street,  it's very crowded.  You go into Paisano, you'll  sit out on the sidewalk, 
[02:25:00]  all the room you want at  your table as you watch  the people walk by.  There's only one thing I  don't like about it.  What?  The restaurants are all  the way on one side, and  then to get to these  restaurants, you've got to  go through the thing where  the guys are, hey, you want  to throw some darts for  the sweetheart?  Come on, come on, get  her a flower, winner  a stuffed animal.  Oh, you don't want to  buy her a rose?  Yeah.  I got my little story  about the San Gennaro.  I'll do it quickly for  the people that heard it  already.  I went down there,  going to have some fun. 
[02:25:30]  I got games and stuff.  It's a bunch of these  big Italian guys.  Hey, you know, it's  San Gennaro.  So it was this booth  where you threw darts,  and you had to pop three  balloons with three  darts to win a prize.  I was on a dart league  at the time.  The darts, they give  you pretty shitty, but  I shoot darts pretty  well.  Well, they don't have  any sharp edges, and the  balloons aren't  inflated enough.  The guy's going, hey,  you want to try?  I go, no, it's all  right.  He goes, no, yeah,  you're on the house. 
[02:26:00]  Just give it a try.  Just try it.  I'm like, all right.  I throw three darts, and I  popped like two balloons,  one bounced off.  He goes, try it again.  Come on, you're good.  So he kept doing it under  the guise that it was  free.  When I go to walk away,  he's like, hey, hey, hey,  30 bucks.  It's like, wait, they were  on the house.  You kept handing them to  me.  No, no, no, no, no, no,  no.  On the house.  Well, it was a business  over here.  What do you think?  What do you think?  The guy shook me down, and  if I tried to walk away,  forget about it.  That would have cracked my  head open.  I'm like, thanks a lot, 
[02:26:30]  Paisan.  A fucking guy, huh?  Totally raped me.  I did the same thing  with the basketball thing,  and I punched a guy in  Buffalo, and he goes,  oh, hey, hey, I don't  want any problems.  I don't want any problems.  Buffalo, not Little Italy.  I understand.  He gave me my money back,  and I left.  Wow.  See what just happened  there?  Probably just topped  your story.  He was a little more  manly.  I know.  Well, no, it's a true  story.  I'm a pussy.  I know.  What am I going to say?  Well, it was a girl.  I wish you to apologize  to Opie.  Yeah.  It was a girl I was  seeing at the time who 
[02:27:00]  was in a horrific car accident.  Accident.  Horrific.  Broke both legs, and  yeah.  I was right on it.  I did it to myself.  That's horrific.  Broke both legs.  That's horrific.  Really bad, and she was  basically in a hospital  and recuperating at home  for almost a year.  It was that bad.  And she's finally getting  out and about again,  and I take her to one  of these dump festivals  they have in Buffalo,  right, and she's  crutching along, and 
[02:27:30]  one of these scumbags,  they have no heart,  right?  All of a sudden,  they just see her.  Like, she's the injured gazelle,  and gives her some,  I forgot if it was  basketballs or the dumb  darts, but the same  type of thing.  Like, hey, sweetheart,  oh, you're injured,  you know, and make a long  story short, she's starting  to shoot the baskets  and stuff.  Same thing.  He wants money out of me,  and it's like $30, $25  after you're done, and  they do it under the  guise that, you know,  it's a little slow, you 
[02:28:00]  know, throw a few for  free, just for fun.  And I'm trying to  remember the exact  details.  I do remember I did  punch him in the face  because he was insisting  that I owed him money,  and I go, you scumbag.  And he's like, no, no,  you know, $30 or  whatever it was.  This goes back at  least 12 years.  So I fucking punched  the guy hard.  He goes, hey, hey, I  don't want any problems,  you know, and then let  us move on.  But now, Giuliani  cleaned it up down  there, by the way, and  you won't find that  scammage going on  anymore.  That's for sure. 
[02:28:30]  Right.  Well, it's Paisano of  Mulberry Street in the  heart of Little Italy.  Joey's been with us for  many, many years.  It's a great restaurant.  I've been there, I  don't know, close to  100 times easily.  Yep.  Anthony, the same thing.  Love it.  I think I'm going to  go down there very, very  soon, actually.  Thursday?  Maybe Thursday.  Maybe Thursday.  We should pop down  there and check it out.  Great Italian cuisine,  and Anthony.  Every single pasta on  the menu is now under  $10.  Paisano, you go in  there.  If Joey's not there, just  tell anyone in there that  you heard about Paisano's 
[02:29:00]  from XM and Opie and  Anthony, and they'll give  you a free glass of  wine, okay?  That's a guarantee.  It's open weekends until  2 a.m.  You can sit out on the  sidewalk, people watch.  It's a great spot.  Paisano of Mulberry  Street in the heart of  Little Italy between  Grant and Hester.  Call 212-965-1188.  That's 212-965-1188.  I know a lot of people  that are listening from  all over the country, but  you're going to be in  New York one of these  days.  Go down there and check  it out, okay?  Everyone ends up here.  Joey likes to hear from  the people that are out  of town and heard about  this from some far away  land, all right? 
[02:29:30]  And this Thursday, it's  the place that Big A is  taking Stalker Patty for  their first date.  First date?  For their first date.  All right.  Paisano of Mulberry  Street.  Yes, Ben?  Dane is here.  Oh, cool.  Dane Cook's here.  He's going to join the  festivities next.  Now, what we should do  as we go to break, Jim  Norton is out in L.A.  Bill Burr sitting in  doing an unbelievable  job.  We're very happy that  Bill's sitting in.  Don't forget to watch  Bill tonight on HBO.  His half-hour comedy  special is at midnight 
[02:30:00]  tonight.  But Jimmy is filming an  HBO series, and we're  trying to keep tabs on  Jimmy.  He's going to be calling  the program a lot as he  goes through this whole  process, and he'll be  back on the show in a  couple weeks for a week,  and then he goes out  there for another couple  weeks.  It's a whole complicated  thing that's going on.  But he called yesterday.  That's the point of  getting to.  Yes, he did.  Poor guy.  Just in case, because  people listen to the  show at all different  times, he called very  early yesterday to give  us our first update.  If you remember, he was  very happy.  He was going out to L.A.  He had an apartment all 
[02:30:30]  set that his manager got  him, and he was ready  for the first table read  for the HBO series.  He went out there early  because Rich Voss is  getting married.  Yeah.  In Canada, it was a  whole thing.  So Jimmy called the  program yesterday, and  just in case you missed  it, here it is.  Like sand through the  hourglass, so is the  ONA virus.  Hey, we've got to say  hi to Jim Norton.  Jimmy!  Isn't that like midnight  in Los Angeles?  What time is it?  It's 4.12 in L.A.  Yeah, a little after  4, I've got to go to bed 
[02:31:00]  because I've got to get  up.  I just had to leave the  apartment that I was  staying in, though.  Why?  Dude, this whole trip  has been just a fucking  disaster.  Of course it has.  Oh, Jimmy.  Sounds bluster.  Before I leave, the last  thing I said, all right,  let me treat myself.  I'll go out, I'll get a  girl.  This is in New York.  I go to a place.  She was recommended to  me by a federal police  officer.  He said she's great  because she has a big  clit.  I get there.  She's about 270 pounds.  I'm like, all right, let me  just see.  Maybe I'll do it and make  the most of it because I'm  leaving.  We're making out. 
[02:31:30]  She tells me I shouldn't  touch her back because she  has Ben Gay on her back  because she has really  heavy tits.  So she's got Ben Gay on  her back and then she  stands up and she shows  me she has fat feet and  she says she has leg  of dermia.  Leg of dermia?  Which is kind of like  what Hillary has, I  think, where they get  fat feet.  And the ankle goes  right, the foot goes  right into the calf.  Yeah, it's where like  water collects.  She's like, yeah, water  collects.  I got to get that fixed.  So my fucking, before I  leave, it's a disaster.  I get here.  The apartment is  roach infested.  I got roaches in my  apartment.  Now, this is the 
[02:32:00]  apartment that you've  rented for how long?  Five months.  Five months.  You went, you looked  at it.  I remember you were  very excited about it  in Hollywood.  But I didn't look, my  managers looked at this  one because the one we  wanted to look at was  too much money.  They lied about the  price.  It was too much money.  So this one, we  accepted and I kind of  signed for without  seeing.  Oh, no.  It was fine.  And I come back, I  got pictures, I got  video, there's fucking  roaches.  It was infested with  cockroaches.  They were in the  bedroom with the  lights on.  Holy shit, get  out of here. 
[02:32:30]  Are you kidding?  Dude, everything is  booked in L.A. because  the stupid Microsoft  convention and the  Emmy's coming up.  So every hotel is  booked.  I had to go into  Beverly Hills.  My manager got me a  deal in a hotel for  two nights.  I have nowhere to  stay out here.  I have nowhere to  stay in L.A.  Homeless little  Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm sure I  won't be homeless, but  so far the trip has  been an abortion and I  haven't even gone to  the studio yet.  What are you going to  do about living  arrangements, though?  I don't know.  You've got two  days.  What's that?  You've got two  days. 
[02:33:00]  Dude, I know you  and I are going to  stupid's wedding in  fucking Edmonton.  The rich boss's  wedding.  And I'm flying  northwest, which is  declaring bankruptcy  and I've had a  maintenance strike for  a month.  I'm never coming  back.  Now, let me tell  you, this is coming  from Jimmy Norton, who  only flies Continental  because, as he's told  everybody, youngest  fleet, they are not in  bankruptcy.  They do very well.  And he's very confident  with flying that  airline.  Only one of two  airlines not in  bankruptcy.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Actually, Jim, they  laid off 3,000 mechanics 
[02:33:30]  and they replaced them  with 1,000.  Who did?  Northwest.  Northwest.  Oh, okay.  That's comforting.  At least they only cut  their mechanic by two  thirds.  That's fine.  That's acceptable.  They just got three  times the work, man.  Three times the work  and they're going to go  in with a smile and make  sure everything's taken  care of.  Of course, because  none of their friends  got fired, you know.  I'm sure they'll still  do their job.  Look, my options were  either that or Alaska  Air, which I won't fly  because they have that  fucking, it looks like 
[02:34:00]  Steve C. on the side  of the plane.  Yeah, it's a big, it's  Steve on the tail.  Yeah, that big, you  know, the content  recording was, wind  sheer, wind sheer.  Pull up, pull up,  pull up.  All right, we're back 
[02:34:30]  with the Ovi and  Anthony program on XM  Satellite Radio.  Thanks for checking us  out.  It's a virus, the  ONA virus spreading  across America, slowly  but surely getting more  gooder every day, I  gotta tell you.  More gooder.  More gooder.  Let me set the table  here.  Jim Norton's out in  Hollywood being a star.  Bill Burr's.  In his cockroach  infested apartment.  Right, Bill Burr is  sitting in and doing 
[02:35:00]  quite well for us.  He's going to be on  HBO tonight.  His half hour comedy  special is at midnight.  We want to just push  that a lot.  We want a lot of people  to check that out  tonight.  And now, joining the  program, Dane Cook.  All right, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  First time in studio.  I like that applause  break off the bat.  I'm just here, listen,  I'm going to shave my  crotch and then I got  to go.  Oh, wow.  First time in studio.  First time in studio  next to Billy Burr, who,  Jesus, man, we've done a  lot of gigs together.  Yeah?  But I got to say, one of  my favorite Bill Burr 
[02:35:30]  stories.  Do you remember the time  you got the buttered,  do you remember the  buttered biscuit?  Will you tell that,  please?  I don't even remember.  I was in, like,  fucking Lee, Massachusetts  doing some fucking  horrific gig.  And it was one of those  deals where it was like  a restaurant and there  was a function room to  the right.  It was like some sort  of bachelor party was  going on.  And I'm standing there  in front of, like,  eight people going,  man, what's up with  Dan Quayle?  Just eating my balls. 
[02:36:00]  And all of a sudden,  I just look over and I  see, like, these three  fucking evil high school  football player looking  guys just standing there.  And I didn't get what  was going on.  I'm like, guys, there's  plenty of seats.  Plenty of seats.  And I'm just fucking  standing there.  And all of a sudden,  in the middle of one of  my jokes, this fucking  dinner roll comes in at  about at least Mach 4.  Bangs off my forehead.  Oh, man.  And then, wow, against  the back wall.  And I'm fucking dazed. 
[02:36:30]  And I turn.  All those guys are gone.  Just sitting there.  I got, like, a welt  from a dinner roll.  It was a fresh one, too.  That's how fucking  hard this guy grew up.  But it was the butter  side that hit you, too.  I remember it was just  this butter, muscle  side of man.  Nobody does anything.  Nobody who's running  the restaurant does a  fucking thing.  And I still got, like,  another ten minutes  sitting there with butter  on the side of my face.  How long do you think  they sat there going,  dude, I'm going to throw  a fucking roll at his head?  Oh, at that point,  I think everybody was  thinking of different things  they could throw for the  rest of the show.  So I'm on the gig, 
[02:37:00]  and then Al and the Monkees,  me, Robert Kelly,  and a couple of other guys  were in this comedy group.  We had to go up  later that night.  And remember,  there was a magician,  Jeff Apotheca,  who did magic at the time.  Masters of Ceremonies.  Jeff Apotheca.  That was his outgoing message,  calling this guy for gigs.  You have reached.  Masters of Ceremonies.  And he's fucking  Lee, Massachusetts,  like he's fucking  Billy Graham or something.  But he had, like,  a bedazzled jacket  with, like, you know. 
[02:37:30]  And so he's got all his  stuff set up, like,  previously on stage,  like, you know,  all these cards,  you know,  giant Joker card.  You remember,  Bobby just goes up on stage,  and because Bobby's set  wasn't going great,  he just starts picking up  this guy's acting,  like, he's pulling the shit out.  He's like,  oh, there's a fake dove in here.  And this guy's just standing there  watching Bobby,  and he just,  this is the exact quote,  you see the color leave his face,  and he goes,  my illusions. 
[02:38:00]  My illusions.  My illusions.  That night was the first,  the first three,  three and a half years  of our fucking career.  Every night,  running into him  in one impossible situation.  The fucking Belrican 99s  that were standing up there,  they're, like,  shutting off the Bruins  playoff game.  Okay, you guys ready  for some comedy?  Oh, no.  Get the fucking game on!  Put the game on!  Oh, it was better  when they would leave  a game on for us,  but, like,  turn the sound down.  So it'd just be like, 
[02:38:30]  you're set going,  all of a sudden,  you hear,  come on!  Yeah.  Come on!  Me and my brother  used to do acoustic gigs  out in Huntington,  and they would do that  during the Islander games,  and they'd turn the sound down,  and you're playing,  and sometimes  it would coincide  right when you finish a song,  something would happen  and you'd hear,  yeah!  And you're thinking,  wow, we did great,  and then you look  and realize  it's just a fucking television,  and you stink,  and no one wants you there.  You nailed it  because I had to do a gig,  Robbie Krieger was playing  at a stupid rock club,  probably the same rock club 
[02:39:00]  you played at.  Yeah.  One of those,  you know,  tiny, tiny little,  yeah,  it's Robbie Krieger  on the door.  Robbie Krieger.  There's that shithole  in Long Beach,  I think, right?  I forgot the name of it.  Whatever.  So, I'm the DJ,  I gotta like do the whole thing,  you know,  hand out bumper stickers  and say,  hey, everybody,  Robbie Krieger.  And the place maybe  fit a hundred people,  maybe,  and they had an Islander game on.  You guys nailed this.  And they wouldn't turn  the sound down  even for Robbie Krieger.  It's Robbie fucking Krieger.  I mean,  they turned it down,  but you can still hear the game,  and people are playing pool, 
[02:39:30]  and you,  you know,  I'm gonna say the exact same thing  you did,  but yeah,  during these,  you know,  he's just playing  without Jim Morrison singing,  obviously,  just the great guitar riffs,  and people are screaming,  you know,  for the Islander game.  What is going through his head  at that moment?  Right?  Right?  I was in the fucking doors, man.  Hollywood Bowl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking rock that place.  And now people are screaming  for the Islanders  as he's playing,  you know,  Spanish Caravan.  You ever seen a show?  It's Stephen Wright.  You ever seen a show  at the Bowl?  Have you seen a show  at the Hollywood Bowl?  It's basically like a great show 
[02:40:00]  until 9.20,  and then there's like  this ordinance  that they have to turn  the fucking volume down  to like four.  So like mid-show Aerosmith,  you're like,  this is great,  and all of a sudden  it's just like,  whoomp,  goes all the way down  because the neighbors  have this thing at 9.20.  You can't,  they can't crank the music anymore.  Oh, that sucks.  That's the worst combo  I think ever.  Comedy and music,  and everybody always tries  to get those shows together  where it's like,  yeah,  it's gonna be,  back in the day,  yeah,  you're gonna open,  and you know,  Juice Newton's gonna come out,  and do 22 minutes. 
[02:40:30]  That'll be great.  Nobody's there to see me,  they're here for Juice.  Oh, yeah.  Speaking of,  it's a tough gig  opening for a rock band.  I was gonna say,  speaking of music and comedy,  the VMAs.  Yeah.  We gotta get into that  a little bit.  Dane Cook,  they gave you what,  three or four minutes?  Yeah,  it was like two minutes.  Two minutes?  And it was two and a half hours  into,  I mean,  that was like a blitz,  man,  coming at you.  That was just,  I was backstage,  they had me back  with Snoop, 
[02:41:00]  waiting to go out,  and they were like,  the guy's pushing me,  one of the union guys,  like,  you gotta stand right here,  stand right here,  and I'm literally up against  electricity,  everything is just like wires,  and all the backs of the stage,  and then I hear,  hit the water,  because that was the theme,  electricity and water,  and there's water dripping on me.  Before my set,  I'm like,  I'm getting rained on  as I'm leaning on all the wires  that are like right around my head.  Are you like,  are you thinking,  you're like,  this is,  I'm gonna kill,  or are you like,  this is just fucking horrendous?  Okay,  so first of all,  there's fireballs going off 
[02:41:30]  during everybody's performance,  you've got rappers that are  threatening each other,  and Shug,  Shug had been shot the night before,  a guy with a hooded sweatshirt  shot Shug Knight,  and all this stuff's happening,  and they got monsoons,  and I'm standing there like,  I've got two jokes,  and that's about it.  I'm like,  can I have a sparkler?  I'll stick it in my ass,  I don't care,  just give me something,  you know,  body paint,  so it really was one of those things  where I was like,  either just go out there  and just,  you know,  talk about the show.  I really kind of wish 
[02:42:00]  I'd go in my first instinct,  because I went out there  and just ended up  playing for the camera,  but I wanted to go out there  and say,  you know what,  fuck you 50 cent,  fuck you Fat Joe,  I'm in this thing now,  and just like,  try to get involved  in their beef,  but it was just like,  go out,  do it,  and get the hell  out of there,  man,  that was wild.  And Bill,  you were saying,  what,  Kelly Clarkson  was right before him?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Screeching in that shower.  That's what I was doing,  because I knew  it was going to be on,  it started out,  I'm going to want to see  Dana on this thing,  it's going to be fucking great,  and like,  two minutes into the show, 
[02:42:30]  I'm like,  oh,  this is going to be,  this is horrifying.  It was just like,  everybody,  half the fucking girls  that can't even sing,  so they have to add  all this extra,  they like lower them  from ceilings,  they come out with animals  and shit.  They think if you  excite their visual sense,  that your audio sense  won't pick up  on the fact  that they stink.  Mariah Carey,  who can sing,  is standing there  like a,  in this pool,  and she's got  backup dancers  who did a backflip  into a pool,  and started dancing  underwater  with this underwater camera, 
[02:43:00]  and then like,  we got comedian,  Dane Cook,  and I'm like,  oh dude,  this is going to be  fucking horrific.  And everybody  right around the front,  like all these kids,  they were flipping out,  and I just remember  at one point,  sometimes you just see  random stuff  during your set  where you're like,  you're trying to,  you're in your head,  you're trying to figure it out,  and I looked down  and there was a kid  just smacking his own face,  I'm like,  I don't know,  he's on E,  or this is just like  the new way to clap,  but he's like,  he's just staring,  he's like,  yeah,  and he's smacking himself  over and over,  he's like,  in the face,  hit me in the face. 
[02:43:30]  Isn't that great  when you don't,  you're not looking at the,  because everyone assumes  you're looking at the big picture,  and a lot of people say,  oh,  the lights are in their eyes,  so you really don't see the crowd,  there are some times  you do just pick out  one person,  or one event  that's going on,  a fight,  a conversation,  and even though  you're going through the motions  and you're saying  or you're singing  or you're doing  whatever you do up there,  you're thinking,  what the fuck is going on  out there?  And it never comes across  on stage  because you're a professional,  you're doing what you do,  but you're looking and going,  that is the most fucked up thing 
[02:44:00]  I've ever seen,  this should really distract me,  I did a college gig  a couple months ago  and there was a girl  in the front row,  I swear to God,  this girl looked 14,  but she's showing her titties  during the show,  and it was like,  it was great  because it was titties,  but I'm like,  this girl's like  literally 14 years old,  she's like the Doogie Howser  of this college,  she was just like,  she was advanced  from 8th grade  to like,  cake parties,  in every way,  apparently,  yes,  wow,  that's funny,  you guys all have 
[02:44:30]  nightmare stories though,  I haven't seen one comic  that went,  every gig's been gold  since I started,  there's always a fucking  nightmare or 8th,  and it never ends either,  no,  huh,  even if you keep doing  college gigs,  it never ends,  yeah,  it never ends,  did Bobby ever tell you  the Boston Garden gig  when we played the,  we did the Rock of Boston show  back when they were  doing that every year,  it was the biggest bomb gig  we'd ever done,  and it was,  and Bobby was probably  so psyched,  oh,  Bobby was,  I mean,  he was,  it was the group again,  we were doing this, 
[02:45:00]  you know,  every year they did  the Rock of Boston,  and they're like,  we're going to put you on,  again,  music and comedy,  you're going to be on  right before Fish,  it's two hours,  it was like,  Extreme's going to go on,  and you,  I was actually in the,  in the crowd for that,  I don't even know why,  you're always at the worst  possible situation,  he's like,  I'm going to tune in,  I'm like,  don't fucking tune in,  when Billy says,  I'm going to be at the gig  or tune in,  I know I'm in trouble,  that was early on,  he didn't,  no,  I was like everyone else,  I was going there for the music, 
[02:45:30]  and then I,  I already had,  I already had tickets,  at least he's being honest,  no,  I didn't know that they  were going to be on that,  and then all of a sudden,  it's just like,  yeah,  dude,  we're going to be doing that,  so literally,  it was one of those things,  two minutes into the show,  I'm like,  how the fuck are they going to do like,  there's like 20,000 people there,  oh man,  it's like this improv group,  they bring us out,  okay,  and when they first announced  that we were going to go out  and perform,  people didn't know we were comedy,  I think they thought we were  like an acapella group,  so at first everyone's like,  ah,  and we're like,  we've arrived man,  they really care, 
[02:46:00]  so we get out there,  we've got these awful lapel mics on,  there's four of us,  and I'll never forget,  Bobby's up there,  and Bobby goes up to the mic,  and he's like,  yeah,  we're going to do some improv,  we're going to blah, blah, blah,  and it's just,  it's the garden,  so the sound is awful,  it's just echoing,  you can't hear anything  anyone's saying,  nothing,  and about a minute in,  you feel the entire,  like you feel people,  oh no,  looking at each other going,  they're not going to sing,  they're like trying to do comedy,  and I'm telling you,  it was like three,  two,  one, 
[02:46:30]  and all of a sudden,  lighters,  a million lighters,  just came like whipping,  and lighters in shoes,  people sacrificing their shoes,  that's what I'm thinking,  I'm like,  I'm getting pelted with lighters,  but I'm like,  did they bring extra shoes to throw,  or are they so angry,  that they're taking off their shoes,  that they don't even care,  they're going to be walking home,  without shoes,  I mean,  upper deck shit littering,  wow,  you guys were in that,  that,  that,  that kung fu bit,  and Al would stand off stage, 
[02:47:00]  he remembers the big,  he was doing the voices,  and they're like,  ha,  we'll kill you now,  and you know,  we're acting out,  and we're acting out,  and so we get,  we're getting hit,  and all this stuff,  and then finally,  you know,  we're hitting sha-na-na-na,  right at that point,  right,  it's you know,  hey,  hey,  goodbye,  hey,  goodbye,  yep,  Bobby goes up to the mic,  and he's like,  I want to say something,  something,  something,  and they actually shut up,  the whole crowd like,  stops,  and I'm like,  Bobby's my hero at this point,  right,  I'm staring at this kid,  he's got his long,  Rico Suave hair, 
[02:47:30]  down to his fucking asshole,  right,  he's looking like Crystal Gale,  and he's like,  I want to say something right now,  and then everyone shows up,  and he goes,  we didn't come here to ruin your night,  oh my,  oh no,  he didn't,  and he starts to email Bobby,  starts getting like,  defensive,  and then he goes like this,  he goes,  and we're going to leave,  and of course,  they're like,  yeah,  after the next two skits,  that we're here to do,  and it was like,  more lighters and shoes,  holy shit,  what a nightmare,  wow,  a set of balls,  walking up to the mic like that,  oh no,  that is really fun, 
[02:48:00]  oh,  and it's like home turf for him,  no more music and comedy,  please,  no,  especially,  like a fish show,  just laid back,  and comedy,  and especially improv comedy,  you need the crowd,  to be focused on you,  you don't want to do it,  in front of a bunch of potheads,  like you can't get,  a concert crowd,  to pay attention,  all at once,  to the band,  that they were there singing,  they're talking,  they're smoking,  they're doing whatever the fuck they do,  for comedy,  it's like,  unless you have a huge portion,  of that audience focused on you,  you're done,  no,  we're asking them,  we're like, 
[02:48:30]  we need an appliance,  and like millions of people,  are like,  Justin,  I think I heard,  I think I heard a microwave,  I think I heard,  it's like,  I think I heard,  a thousand people yelling shit at us,  right now,  clusterfuckers,  but these are the gigs,  gentlemen,  then,  build your character,  now you're playing the garden there,  Dane Cook,  last night,  show number one,  how was it,  it was amazing,  I think that tonight,  we get two tonight,  was that the biggest show,  of your life,  you think,  no, 
[02:49:00]  it was,  we did the tour,  gas and tour,  and we did some pretty big venues there,  and I did that gator gras last year,  which was 50,000,  I don't know if you've done that,  that's pretty cool,  what's your audience made up of a lot,  a lot of,  yeah,  it's pretty mixed up,  I mean,  it's definitely that college,  college core,  but no,  I look out,  and it's,  it seems to be all over the board,  you know,  you got a lot of chicks though,  that like,  want to fuck you,  and things like that,  a lot of girls,  yeah,  they wear t-shirts with my joke,  which is really great,  because like,  half the time,  fuck bees on it,  and I'm like, 
[02:49:30]  oh,  I'll do that next,  some 14 year old girl,  hasn't lifted it up yet,  hey,  let's say hi to Ryan,  in New Jersey,  saw Dane Cook last night,  Ryan,  what's up,  what's up dude,  Dane man,  you fucking ruled last night,  hey,  thanks a lot man,  thanks for coming out dude,  yeah dude,  Bob Kelly ruled too,  my girlfriend doesn't even like,  oh and a,  and none of that shit,  but last night man,  she fucking loves Kelly,  loved you,  and now I think she's an oh and a fan,  oh that's cool,  oh that's good,  good deal man,  hard to get the girls on,  but see,  you got it knocked, 
[02:50:00]  you know,  the girls are there with you,  you got a very diverse crowd,  us,  it's a cock fest,  it's just like,  yeah fucking A guys,  and the girls,  they hate it,  and I don't know what we're doing,  we're trying to soften our delivery a little bit,  so we can have more women out there,  yeah,  that's what I'm getting at all,  let's bring some girls down to the studio,  we're going to do hugs,  we're going to do free hugs every hour,  come on down,  well we noticed since Jimmy's been gone,  the past couple of days,  girls have warmed up to us,  that's right,  we had girls in the studio,  that were willing to take all their clothes off, 
[02:50:30]  which is always a good thing,  a girl called up to play,  guess what's in my pants,  Jimmy,  we had a strap on show the other day,  Jimmy scares girls away,  they walk in,  and he looks like,  he's going to be a problem,  he looks like,  he looks like,  no matter what they do,  he's going to want to go one step more,  than they're willing to go,  like they could want to take that,  like the girls the other day,  they came in completely naked,  took that wiffle ball bat,  right up there,  lubed it up,  and stuck it right inside them,  and we measured how deep it went, 
[02:51:00]  everything fine,  with Jimmy,  they're probably thinking,  he's going to want to stick it up my ass,  like just that one step,  where it's probably going to be a problem,  so they don't even want to get started,  when you think about what Jimmy talks about,  and then you wonder what the skeletons are,  in his closet,  what could there possibly be in there,  he's got to be holding something back,  it has to involve murdered children,  it's all I can imagine,  it's got to be kids,  death,  rape,  he's just going to have like another room, 
[02:51:30]  that he's dug out in his basement,  or something like that,  but he's just got him down there,  bound and gagged,  and tries out his new bits on him,  what a little creep,  by the way,  speaking of Bob Kelly,  he gave us the famous cast,  all right,  oh yeah,  how's that going on the auction,  yeah,  on our O&A auction,  it's up to $1,300,  nice,  broke my knee man,  I broke my knee man,  I broke my knee man,  hold my hand man,  Dane Cook obviously was there,  when that happened,  filming the tourgasm thing,  I've never heard any horrific sound, 
[02:52:00]  like that in my life,  that was just,  that pop,  and then,  when you see the video,  that goes with it,  it's just,  it's crazy,  he had no business,  no business,  playing football,  we didn't,  none of us did,  here's what was stupid,  you could,  I'm telling you,  we were playing on uneven terrain,  in like a gravel pit,  you know,  we were just like,  oh,  we'll throw a ball around,  and then we got competitive,  it was not flat like a field,  it was really like hilly,  and it was just,  we were dumb,  we were dumb,  but Bobby tried to, 
[02:52:30]  you know,  go up and do some kind of like,  like a Heisman fucking catch,  no Bobby gets crazy,  when he plays sports,  I remember one time,  I was playing against him,  and he wasn't having a good day,  or something,  I had a couple of catches,  and he just,  he's hilarious,  he's just competitive,  so he got mad at me,  so I just see the look on his face,  that he wants to take me out,  on this play,  so he came at me,  and somehow,  I was able to push him down to the ground,  and he landed on the ground,  he got,  he was so mad,  that he grabbed two handfuls of grass,  ripped him out of the ground,  and he got up,  and he just threw him at me, 
[02:53:00]  and they went about 90 miles an hour,  for two inches,  and then they went,  right in front of me,  I just remember this,  this black kid who was on my team goes,  yo,  he bugged him,  and he had to go back to the huddle,  trying to hit you with like confetti,  oh yeah,  he was unbelievable,  what is that going to do,  the rage,  angry little guy,  he's the most competitive guy,  I know,  and I admit,  I'm pretty competitive,  but we had a,  when we used to have a game,  back in 93,  I don't know if Bill,  you were part of this awful,  horrible thing, 
[02:53:30]  it was called,  punch each other in the asshole,  no,  I would have remembered that,  that's something you don't forget,  okay,  so we started this thing,  where we would just start randomly,  if you know,  the other one was walking in front of you,  up the stairs,  we would not just punch,  we would uppercut,  and try to hit taint,  try to hit anything we could,  full tilt boogie,  punch in the asshole,  and it became like,  Bobby and I being so competitive about it,  that we actually had to sit down,  I'll never forget,  sit down and have a very serious conversation about it, 
[02:54:00]  where it involved us looking at each other going,  we gotta stop punching each other,  this is really,  like,  can we just,  can we call it even,  are we,  you know,  we have to stop doing this,  and we couldn't,  I mean,  for the longest time,  we just still had to like,  and we wanted to make each other like,  shit our pants,  it was like a full,  like a real,  like the hardest hit you could imagine,  I wanna know how that starts,  one of you,  had to come up with it,  you didn't both come up with the idea,  at the same exact time,  who punched,  whose ass,  and it's pretty brave,  that's what the road will do to you man, 
[02:54:30]  I was gonna say,  it's pretty brave for the person,  to introduce that to other guys,  hey guys,  I got a great new idea,  for us to pass the time,  I would think to do the,  the classic leg sweep,  if someone was in front of me,  I would never think,  we used to do blindside tackle,  you know,  one guy would like,  you know,  be on all fours behind someone,  and then you knock him over the guy,  oh yeah,  when he was,  the bottom of the shoe kick,  when you're behind somebody,  and they're walking,  they step,  and you kick the bottom of their shoe,  and they,  they do like a Nazi goose step,  with one foot,  goes flying,  or the flat tire,  where you just step on the back of their shoe, 
[02:55:00]  and take off their Achilles tendon,  cross check into the locker,  yeah,  looking down for his notebook,  those unforgiving metal lockers,  I like the coin slap,  anytime somebody's counting their change,  you're like,  what do you think I can,  and you just get it underneath,  it's just like this,  rainbow of currency,  you had your guys,  doing a lot of activities on tour there,  I saw the,  I saw the scooter race,  we would have slept all day,  I mean,  that was the thing,  it was like,  these guys hated me,  because I'm going,  every day we're going to get up, 
[02:55:30]  you know,  just for the sake of filming,  during the day,  you know,  because we'd sleep until,  you know,  the crack of three,  they had some mean things to say about you though,  there Dane,  that you were working hard,  in between shows,  horseback riding,  what else did you guys do?  Oh, we trashed Bob for that show,  I opened for Charlie Murphy,  but no point,  did he make me do activities,  my day was mine,  he didn't call me up,  yo,  we're playing checkers this morning,  get your ass down here,  bitch,  it looks like,  it looks like it's going to be a great video,  when it finally comes out,  I was watching the video portion, 
[02:56:00]  of your package,  Jesus,  the Dane Cook CD,  DVD thing,  on the way to LA,  with the shorties,  and the preview for Torgasm,  it looks like it's going to be a good thing,  when it finally comes out,  everyone's been saying that,  saying that,  you've got a clip of Bobby,  laying on the ground,  something about Bobby,  with his knees,  yeah,  just screaming and stuff,  yeah,  we have that on,  we filmed that,  the scooter race though,  I saw,  who took a dive on that,  was that you?  that was me man,  yeah,  that was really nasty,  that was day one,  and we had these little electronic scooters, 
[02:56:30]  and it was just,  you know,  it's going to be great,  we're going to be racing again,  me and Bobby,  and Bobby,  very competitive again,  sticks his fucking foot,  right back into my tire,  he says he didn't do it on purpose,  but if you look,  you kind of see him,  kind of look back,  and I think he aimed it,  so he could jam my tire,  and I of course went over,  and cracked up,  electric scooters,  and Bobby's acting like,  it's the road warrior,  Bobby,  he's a winner,  he will figure out,  how to come out on top,  yeah,  he hates to lose,  yeah,  go for him,  very competitive, 
[02:57:00]  yeah,  we did activities,  that's right,  I saw it on Kimmel,  yeah,  is that where that was at,  yeah,  just face first,  through the asphalt,  and you were in Rolling Stone recently,  the CDs like,  selling like crazy,  what is it up to now,  because we've all been paying attention,  going holy shit,  the first week it was like,  what,  close to a quarter million copies,  sold or something like that,  I think it's,  I like the,  yeah,  we went gold,  we went gold,  I like the,  I don't know,  when they know the exact number,  Barry Katz knows exactly how many units,  of course he does, 
[02:57:30]  he knows exactly,  but the CD,  the CD's gotten gold,  the CD's gotten gold,  yeah,  it went gold,  you can't really call it a CD,  because you have the DVD in there,  and all sorts of stuff,  but,  yep,  yeah,  what is it,  half a million,  it's gold or a million,  with a double album,  we've shipped almost 500,000,  so,  once you hit 250,  that's gold on a double,  and then platinum is probably a few weeks away,  yeah,  yeah,  that's amazing,  I know man,  I sold three of my CDs off my website,  I bought them,  and I bought two of them,  I'm pretty proud of them,  you want them back, 
[02:58:00]  it's just amazing,  because people aren't,  people are just not,  I've been autographing to you,  people are just not buying CDs,  obviously,  like they used to,  so a comedy CD to sell that much,  that's just phenomenal,  yeah,  somehow the CD,  I've noticed,  like I said,  in like the last few months,  all of a sudden you go to a college,  and it's like you're holding up like a fucking 8 track,  oh,  you were saying that the other day,  yeah,  yesterday,  yeah,  it's just,  oh,  now they all want like a DVD,  because they can get this shit for free somehow,  you know,  yeah,  somehow,  just ask Steve,  he knows,  let's say hi to,  burn anything for us,  yeah,  Mike on Long Island, 
[02:58:30]  Mike,  what's up?  Hey,  boys,  how you doing?  Alright,  what's up?  Good day,  I was at a show last night,  wonderful job,  thank you dude,  how do you feel when people applaud for bits you're about to do?  Oh yeah,  all you said was,  I went to a party,  and the place blew up,  right,  right,  I mean,  you know what,  it's flattering,  of course,  when people,  you know,  kind of hear their,  you know,  you feel like a little like Bon Jovi,  it's like,  you guys know bad medicine,  and everybody just starts,  but you know, 
[02:59:00]  that's why I do that,  I like to kind of,  I always try to improvise with stuff,  and really not really know exactly where I'm going with it,  because at least that makes it interesting,  if you've heard the bit before,  there's something in there,  you're like,  oh,  I never heard that part,  or it takes on kind of a new energy with every crowd,  but it's cool,  man,  it's definitely,  I did that one bit last night where I threw the mic out,  and they finished the,  I did the setup,  and then they finished the punch,  and that was,  I've never really done anything like that,  that was kind of wild,  yeah.  We've talked to Brian Regan about that,  he goes,  it's frustrating when people are yelling out the punch line of jokes, 
[02:59:30]  saying,  cup of dirt,  do cup of dirt,  and Brian's like,  well,  that's the punch line,  all right,  I'll do it,  big yellow one's the sun,  yeah,  exactly,  yeah,  it's weird,  I mean,  even like,  I know,  I was reading all those things with Chappelle before he went into hiding,  where it was like,  people were just coming and just,  I'm Rick James,  bitch,  and it's like,  yeah,  that must have just been all over the place,  it's a blessing and a curse,  because you dream as a comic of doing something that people actually give a shit about quoting at all,  and so you want that your whole career, 
[03:00:00]  and then when they do it,  you realize,  oh man,  sometimes it can throw off the flow of the show,  but at this point,  I'm digging it,  well,  you gotta be,  and it's great to be huge and on top like that,  are you thinking about something like burnout,  or,  you know,  overexposure,  shit like that,  where you go,  uh oh,  you know,  what do you do about that?  I'm just,  at this point,  it's,  I mean,  really,  things are just starting to roll,  so I'm certainly not,  yeah,  I'm just,  you know,  whatever,  I gotta take it right to the end, 
[03:00:30]  you know?  He's going into movies next.  Is that it?  Do some flicks?  Yeah.  He offers?  He'll be the next guy that just leaves his comedy behind,  and,  never leave comedy behind,  does the movie thing.  No,  I definitely,  I'm going to start doing some more,  more flicks,  but,  you know,  comedy is,  how many lame offers have you had for like sitcoms and movies that are just like,  stop it.  I,  I,  here's the worst pitch I ever had.  A guy brought me in a few years ago,  and he goes,  um,  we're really excited.  We want to,  who wants you to do this?  I'll never forget,  look at it. 
[03:01:00]  I wanted to fucking kill you,  man.  I got Barry next to me.  Can we get Barry on the air?  Barry,  we love when you come on the air with us.  Come on.  This is going to be the best,  pants you've ever heard.  Everyone imitates Barry,  and when we do it,  no one understands who we're imitating,  but,  but we have him in studio today,  so.  you have to see him.  He's the only guy I know who wipes his teeth while he's talking to you.  Listen,  so the guy brings us in,  and he goes,  here's the show,  and this was the actual pitch.  He goes,  okay,  you're a teacher.  You're like a,  a substitute teacher,  and so far,  I'm like,  okay,  that hasn't been done,  you know,  a million times, 
[03:01:30]  but yeah,  and he's like,  and the kids love you,  but here's the deal.  You're magic.  What?  And I'm like,  okay,  I do magic?  He's,  no,  no,  no,  you're magical.  You're Mr. Wiz.  That was the name of the show.  You're Mr. Wiz,  and he had,  he had me driving like,  a rainbow VW Bug,  and I do my spells on the kids,  and I mean,  it was just,  wow.  I sit there and hear this.  You're like,  have you seen my stand-up,  first of all?  Am I doing anything like  what you're talking about?  Mr. Wiz.  I'm Mr. Wiz. 
[03:02:00]  Every week.  I think I was on notice  for a month after that.  Well,  you should have been.  That's why Barry set up the man.  That is horrible.  And what year was this about?  Barry,  you're going to be a big star.  90,  like 98 or 90,  I don't know.  It was bad.  You know,  it just would have been  bad effects,  like bad cheap sitcom  special effects  for your magic.  Yeah,  where you stay still,  and then they put  the other person  who's supposed to appear  around you,  but you kind of see the image.  But you've moved a little bit  in between. 
[03:02:30]  Some awful time slot.  You're on right after Sabrina,  the teenage witch.  That's your leading.  You've made two of yourselves,  and you have to talk  to each other,  and there's got to be  a wall line  between the two of you  where they superimpose you.  There's always a talking animal.  I got like a llama.  There's a pad.  And he's got those  real creepy mannequin eyes.  Wow,  that is a bad pitch.  You've got to think  people are joking  at first  when you sit there  and they come up  with these pitches  and you're like,  all right,  this is a joke. 
[03:03:00]  They're doing some kind  of a punk show  or something.  I actually,  I had some guy  pitch something to me  a few months ago,  again,  with these guys,  and I thought  they were fucking with me.  I really,  really thought.  Yeah,  sometimes you get guys  who pitch  and they have phenomenal ideas  and they've actually written  and produced  and million dollar things  that have gone on,  but they are so nervous  when they pitch  that they look like  they're having a seizure  when they're pitching.  That was the one  you're talking about.  Yeah,  the guy was sweating  and he's just rambling 
[03:03:30]  on and on.  There's no rhyme or reason  but that was a real idea.  It was a real idea  but the guy literally  had to carry him  out of there.  I was on notice again.  Yeah,  I'm sure.  All right,  you're hanging,  right,  Dane?  Yeah.  We're going to take a break.  What are we promoting today,  Barry?  Because Dane's not going  to do it.  Retaliation,  baby.  Retaliation.  It's out there  and it's sounding like crazy.  And you can come  by the show.  We might release  a few tickets  that people don't show up  for guest lists  and things like that  if your people don't show up. 
[03:04:00]  No,  I'm going.  We're all going tonight.  I'm serious.  We're all going to go  see Dane.  It's going to be  a kick-ass show tonight,  definitely,  without a doubt.  All right,  more with Dane Cook.  Also on the way,  we got Martha Stewart  and P. Diddy rapping together.  Oh,  this is...  We got to do this  while you guys  are in studio today.  He,  you know,  I keep saying,  wow,  that guy's got no street cred  but he lost it so long ago.  Now,  though,  when he's rapping  and teaching Martha Stewart  how to rap.  Hip words  and...  He's got his own line 
[03:04:30]  of craftsman tools  that he just released.  Yo,  let me tell you  about my wrench.  Yeah,  it's...  The Snoop.  The Snoop with the golfing  and the...  The Snoop is the worst.  Let me tell you,  it locks on to the nut.  It's wonderful.  Rap is where, like,  heavy metal was  in, like,  1990  when, like,  Winger  and all those groups  were coming.  It's over.  Yeah.  They used to be scary  with something.  I was just like,  everybody needs a sidekick.  Snoop was so scary  until he's like,  let's go golfing  I a fizzle.  It's like golfing 
[03:05:00]  Lee I a coca.  If you could find  a better de-zizzle,  buy it.  Why not?  Stop.  No, Snoop, stop.  What are you doing?  It's so not scary now.  You just...  Why not?  It's a little soft shoe  there for us.  It just does...  It comes off so bad.  Lee I a coca.  Stop.  All right,  more with Dane Cook.  As we go to break,  I think we're going to  play the  Broke My Knee Man song.  Oh, I haven't heard this.  Yeah, the listeners  really ran with this one, man. 
[03:05:30]  They ran, man.  When you got us  the audio of Bob Kelly  breaking his knee,  they were remixes.  Did you ever hear  The Goodfellas?  I thought was a good one.  I did hear that.  I did hear that, yeah.  Are you here?  Well, let's play it really fast.  It's only 40,  like, 50 seconds.  Listen to this first.  Look, he started to touch me.  He started to grab me.  I told him to stop.  He didn't stop.  I hit him back.  And then he got really angry.  He pushed me out of the car. 
[03:06:00]  What do you want,  fucko?  You want something?  What do you do?  Oh, no.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I swear to my fucking mother,  if you touch her again,  you're dead.  Oh, my hand, man.  I've got to squeeze some.  Fuck.  How good is that?  Oh, my God. 
[03:06:30]  That's classic.  That came in from one of our listeners.  That's the best one.  We got...  Holy shit.  That's the best.  We had...  I can't even tell you  how many came in, Dane.  I totally forgot about that one.  Oh, the Immigrant Song.  A couple dozen.  You want to play  the Immigrant Song one?  All right, listen to this.  I'll have to get these on, dude.  Yeah, we'll give you  a disco, all these.  Listen to this.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man. 
[03:07:00]  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I broke it, dude.  I fell to crack.  I broke my leg.  I broke it.  Aren't we great friends?  We're great friends.  I'm going to squeeze something  that Bobby kept saying.  I've got to go home my hand, man.  Oh, God.  And you've got the video  that'll be part of the tourgasm  video when it hits.  That'll be on there.  We're putting it together.  Do we have another one?  That alone is worth it. 
[03:07:30]  You should throw some  of these remixes  on something.  I don't know what.  God damn.  They are heartless,  the listeners.  They don't care that he's injured.  They just see an opportunity  for something funny.  Was the sheep one good?  I don't know.  This might...  Yeah, play that real fast.  It's only like 15 seconds.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah, motherfucker.  Ah!  Ah!  You mother...  Ah!  It's been backwards.  Ah!  Ah! 
[03:08:00]  Ah!  Fuck!  Steve, you've got to throw  all these on a CD for Dane.  I really have to injure Bobby again.  I think that was it.  We have so many.  I'm trying to remember  some of the better ones.  Oh, God.  That Goodfellas one  is so goddamn funny.  It fits perfectly.  Best one ever.  I have to say, man,  the thing that, you know,  I've got to give Bobby props.  Anybody else would have left  that tour that night.  and he got back on, like,  a non-stop moving bus 
[03:08:30]  and he's on there  with his fucking wobbly leg.  And so, uh,  he hung in there, man.  That was great.  We'll play the  Broke My Knee song  going into break.  Maybe some more remixes,  but definitely more  with Dane Cook  in just a bit.  Down, you're way down.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man. 
[03:09:00]  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  I'm going to squeeze something on the sides.  I broke my knee, man.  It bent backwards.  Does it hyperextend? 
[03:09:30]  I broke my knee, man.  It bent backwards.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I hurt him quite good.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude. 
[03:10:00]  Oh my god, I don't believe you. 
[03:10:30]  What the fuck!  Oh my hand man!  I got a sweet suck!  Oh my hand man!  I got a sweet suck!  I broke that fucking thing!  I broke it!  I broke my leg man!  I broke my leg!  I broke it!  I broke it dude!  I felt a crap!  I broke my knee man!  I broke my knee man! 
[03:11:00]  I broke my knee, man, I broke my knee, man, I broke my knee, man, I broke my knee, dude.  I broke my leg, man.  I got so much pain, dude.  I got so much pain. 
[03:11:30]  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Let's say hi to Dragon Wagon.  Yeah, guys, you totally...  What?  You broke up.  We can't hear you.  You totally offended me today.  We totally...  I'm an over-the-road truck driver, and this dude, these things, you know, I'm talking about  is ridiculous.  What are you talking about? 
[03:12:00]  The what thing, sir?  Have you taken any histamine before you call next time, you clogged-nosed idiot?  You guys are disgusting.  I mean, you know, I turned it on.  I'm calling next to him and complaining about this channel that all of us do.  Really?  Yeah.  What don't you like about the channel?  Well, you guys are hacks.  You wouldn't be Howard Stern.  I mean, you know, it's indecent.  It's immoral what you're talking about.  You know what you should do, sir?  Right after you call XM, you should drink a fifth of Old Grandad and then drunk drive 
[03:12:30]  into a schoolyard.  No one cares about you or if you're offended.  Block the channel, stupid.  It's an XL channel.  You can block it.  That's why XM has that.  You need to F you.  That's what you need to do.  Okay?  I'm hanging up.  Good.  Hang up.  Cancel XM and drop dead.  Let's not go that far.  All right.  Don't cancel XM.  Go to listen to XM Kids or something.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe that's the wrong thing to say in front of Eric Logan.  And this guy, now he's listening to himself. 
[03:13:00]  He'll be listening.  Listen, I'll go with Sirius Radio.  Good.  Go to Sirius Radio.  There's a fucking dog for the thing.  They stink.  You're going to have to drive a truck to have Sirius.  Throw it in the back of the truck, you fucking hick.  Die.  See, get in front of me and I can run you over.  Why don't you fucking blow your nose before you call a national radio show, you crank-doing  jerk-off?  Now he's listening to himself. 
[03:13:30]  Of course he is.  He'll be listening.  Of course he will.  He'll be listening.  He'll call tomorrow.  And he doesn't even have the balls to say, fuck you.  We're uncensored, pal.  You can say, fuck you.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in that?  You're a liar and you're a failure.  Well, I'm not a failure.  Yes, you are.  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Why don't you have your fucking sinuses fixed?  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  All truck drivers are over-the-road, stupid.  They don't go through lawns and pools. 
[03:14:00]  You redundant shithead.  I didn't hear you, sir.  I'm doing drugs and surviving an incest experience.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You don't know.  Break a breaker for the dragon wagon.  Is that his name?  Dragon wagon?  It's a dragon wagon.  You got your ears off. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry.  You sounded like you had more brains on the radio.  Hold on, sir.  Wait, is your name really?  Dude, is your name really Dragon Wagon?  You're a grown man with a name that rhymes.  Hey, slow down with the weird grown-up names.  Yeah, that's a child name.  At least it doesn't rhyme.  It's not Mopey Opie.  It's Mopey Opie, Slim Jim, and whatever the fuck rhymes with Anthony. 
[03:15:00]  I can't think of anything.  Shmantony.  If you don't understand, I'm out of here busting my ass for you people to be doing your dumb radio show.  How are you busting your ass for us, stupid?  You're busting your ass to put food on your fat wife's table.  We have nothing to do with it.  No, you're the type that voted for George Bush, aren't you?  You're the type that...  No, sir, I don't vote.  I talk a lot of shit, and then I sit home on election day. 
[03:15:30]  That's the beauty of me.  But you're the reason the fuel prices are so hot in this country driving...  I'm the reason, you motherfucker, you drive a truck!  I have a Saturn, I cruise prostitutes in Manhattan.  Your food has to get there.  You have fucking 80 gallons of fuel in your vehicle.  I go a month on a gallon of gas.  43rd Street to 15th Street, circled for four hours, back home.  O.P. and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[03:16:00]  All right.  Very, very busy day on the O.P. and Anthony program today.  Bill Burr in studio.  Definitely want to remind people, Bill's half-hour comedy special on HBO is tonight at midnight.  Make sure you check out Bill Burr.  Yeah, we're here tomorrow night at midnight, too.  Well, I got the on-demand, so I'll be watching it Sunday morning when I wake up.  In your slippers.  And, of course, Dane Cook playing Madison Square Garden tonight. 
[03:16:30]  It's a nice little room.  Not bad.  Jesus Christ.  Playing the garden.  Where is that?  It's no Carnegie Hall, but it's...  No one's got to ask that.  I'm playing the chuckle hut.  Where is that?  I'm playing the garden.  Is that the...  What garden?  The fucking garden.  That's fantastic.  I think last time, who said it, it's great to not have the words ha-ha in the phone number?  Oh, that's good.  And, of course, the CD slash DVD is called Retaliation, Dane Cook.  Selling, like, hotcakes.  Yes. 
[03:17:00]  Were hotcakes ever really selling?  Was there, like, a time in history when hotcakes were just...  Just for that saying to be there, there must have been one time where, like, we're fresh  out again.  Jesus.  They just sold.  Comedy clubs really do have some of the worst fucking names.  I worked to play side splitters.  Side splitters.  Why don't you just call it knee slappers?  Gay club that I had to play years ago.  Remember Fiddlesticks?  Yeah.  Did we play that?  Fiddlesticks.  Fiddlesticks.  Then I'll be at Gaffaws.  Oh.  We had to take a break just to take leaks and stuff, but the stuff that was happening during  the break was really entertaining as well. 
[03:17:30]  Dane met the lead singer of Missing Persons.  Bill was talking about Scary Spice.  Oh, opening up for Wynonna Judd.  Just talking about...  Wynonna Judd.  Outside at a racetrack at, like, 12 noon.  Yeah.  12 noon at a racetrack.  Cars or horse?  What was it?  A horse.  Horse track?  It was like a horse track, and I'm standing up there just bombing.  You can't shit on the crowd because it's her audience, and you don't want to...  You need the gig at that point, so you're doing it.  And I'm standing there.  There's people kind of filing in, and there's this lesbian, biker-looking chick. 
[03:18:00]  And my host said, she's just standing there chanting, Wynonna!  Wynonna!  Oh, God.  And you just want to be, you fucking whore.  You just want to go off on her, and you can't.  You've got to be actually cordial.  Yeah.  You feel like a game show host.  How do you not, first of all, have a nervous breakdown before you go out on stage?  And how do you even step out onto that stage?  That's where you comics, I don't even know how...  People ask me, they go, why don't you try stand-up?  Are you insane? 
[03:18:30]  To have to do something like that, where you know the gig is a fucking...  It's noon at a horse race track, to a crowd that wants to see Wynonna Judd, and you actually  make your legs work and walk out onto a stage.  How do you do it?  I literally learned how to bomb gracefully on that gig.  I'll never forget it.  I was sitting there.  I was just eating my balls, just feeling like an asshole.  And somewhere in the middle of it, I swear to God, I just started imagining Patrice O'Neill,  Keith Robinson, and Jim Norton sitting in the back, watching me, laughing at me. 
[03:19:00]  And I somehow started laughing at myself, how fucking ridiculous...  I mean, I was in the middle of my set at one point, out of nowhere, they all just go,  ah, I screamed, and I'm like, you know, I thought my fly was down.  I turned around, way in the background was a carnival, and some guy was on that ride where  you get shot into the fucking air, and I guess that went up and over me from behind.  I just started doing this self-deprecating, how pathetic my career was, and I was able  to handle that lady in a roundabout way, called her a lesbian, which of course the whole country 
[03:19:30]  audience loved.  I said something about her haircut, how short it was, and people knew what I was alluding  to, so, you know, country people, fuck the queers.  I got them on my side.  But, oh, it was just, it was brutal.  I just, I have no clue how you do that.  That's what I do now.  Anytime a horrible, I just picture up, Dane, I'll picture somebody I know just laughing.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's how you got through, like, the beginning ones, like, as you're going up at the fucking 
[03:20:00]  Bell Ricker 99 and the game's on, it's like, I've been watching him bombing, and it's like,  you want to laugh, but it's like, you know you're going up there, too.  It's like, you've got an ass-kicking coming, so you're almost jealous, like, fuck.  These guys love when he's getting it over with.  He's halfway through it.  These guys love when they're on bomb.  That's the one thing I learned, you know, hanging out with a lot of comedians.  You guys love when someone's eating it.  Yeah.  It's almost, it's like sport to you guys.  Oh, yeah.  It's fair game with each other.  It's almost like, you know, the way black guys can call each other the N-word, and, 
[03:20:30]  like, it's cool.  Like, comics can be like, dude, you stink, you're bombed.  And it's like, yeah, that was good, huh?  But anybody else says it.  Do you know, do you know, like, the worst heckle, like, you've ever gotten?  Do you keep that on tap, like, the worst thing that anybody's ever yelled?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the most bizarre one I ever got?  I was at Dangerfield's third show on a Saturday night.  There's, like, fucking 30 people there.  That place is the worst to do comedy here.  So there's these three angry white dudes in the back, and you just can feel the rage.  Ghosts are walking out during your sets.  It looks like a funeral home, man. 
[03:21:00]  I know.  It's like, you can just feel the rage in these guys.  And I hear them talking, and I know they're fucking talking about me.  And I'm like, dude, don't go there.  Don't talk to them.  After a while, I just couldn't.  I finally just said, you guys, what's your problem, man?  You're just talking.  You know, what's going on?  And this dude, this most bizarre heckle ever, he goes, anything red and on stage is a faggot.  And it was just, it was so fucking bizarre, I didn't even have a comeback to it. 
[03:21:30]  I can't believe that.  But it was, like, brilliant.  And I was sitting there going, like, and he was so angry the way he said it, I knew if  I just said one thing back to him, I had a fist in my face.  Yeah.  So I somehow had to just go back into my act.  So I got a computer recently and just completely blew it off.  I had a guy at Dublin's one night.  He was sitting in the front row, and he was really, really despondent, and he's drunk,  and he's talking to himself, and he turned his chair away from the stage, but he's right 
[03:22:00]  up front.  So he's facing the crowd.  He's, like, doing little monologues to himself and trying to, like, the show's on him.  And same thing.  I'm like, dude, what's your problem, what's your problem?  Three or four times, and he keeps, like, shrugging me off.  And I finally go, really, man, what is your problem?  And he stands up, and the whole place goes quiet because he's holding a bottle in his hand.  I think somebody thought he was going to throw it, and he goes, I've got seven problems.  And you're five of them.  Wow.  That's really fucking genius.  Did he name them? 
[03:22:30]  Did he name the five?  No, he never even got into it.  We did actually get into a little, I think I, no, we, we had a little fight up front.  Why are those people there?  Like, I don't get why they're even there.  I've been to comedy clubs, and I've seen comics that just have sucked, and you sit and wait for the next guy.  Why do people feel compelled, you fucking suck, you're an asshole.  I'll tell you what, the best, like, you go up in front of an all-black crowd, it's like, what I quickly learned is they're going to have fun with you or without you. 
[03:23:00]  So either you make them laugh, it's the way, you bomb them from a black crowd, it's like, the joke bombs, there's nothing, and then everybody laughs that it got nothing.  I remember one time I'm just, mixed nuts in L.A., just eating my balls, and it's all black crowd.  So I do some jokes, ba-da-ba-da-ba-da, nothing.  And then I see this big black lady in the background that goes, wah, wah, wah, and then they all just stop fucking laughing.  And once again, I don't address it, I go into my neck, so I fucking, oh, just dry mouth. 
[03:23:30]  And it's even worse when you, oh, yeah, sound on the mic.  Yeah, and he forgot to bring water up, and it's just, oh, it's the worst.  I just remember gigs where nothing was happening, and I could just hear that fucking Patrice laugh from the back of the room, where it would be like, that same kind, because he has that kind of,  Patrice can actually make you bomb.  I've had crowds liking me, he didn't like the joke, and he's so fucking loud and intimidating, he would get a crowd to turn on you. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, what's that shit?  Yo, Bill's up there, he's talking about this motherfucker, Jason.  And the whole crowd is turning around, and no one's going to tell him to shut up.  And then you start yelling at him, and then all of a sudden, the white guy's yelling at the big black guy, this is racism.  And then you lose all the white people in the crowd, and he can literally turn around a good set.  That is true.  Let's go to the phones here, Andy has a question.  Andy, what's up?  Andy.  Hey.  No?  Nothing? 
[03:24:30]  You?  His name's not Andy, it's probably like...  Somebody else.  Andrew.  Andrew.  And he thinks it's, or Anthony, or...  The guy that has a question for Dane Cook about a corporate gig.  No?  No, nothing.  All right.  He wanted to ask you if you were fired from a corporate gig.  Like, there might be a story there.  Is there urban legend out there about that?  Oh, no, you know what?  No, I'll tell you what it is, because I was hired to do these two corporate gigs, and I just did the first one out now, and I never...  Uh-oh, Barry Katz is last.  I never...  I never do them.  You know what I mean?  You don't do corporate gigs? 
[03:25:00]  No, because it's just like, you don't really enjoy it.  You feel rented.  You feel like a part of the, you know...  You really do.  It's just...  So, I agreed to do it, because they were really enthusiastic.  It came with the tent that they set up.  Oh, yes.  One of those floppy-armed dolls was behind you on stage, like, you know, come by a car.  And so, ugh.  I agreed to do it.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Go ahead, Barry.  What happens, these corporate gigs, they, like, they always overpay.  They completely overpay.  Right.  They'll send private jets.  They'll do whatever. 
[03:25:30]  It's like...  Whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes.  And so, it's always hard to...  Turn down, yeah.  To walk away from those things.  So, I'm like, you know what?  I'll do it.  I haven't done one in years, and that's two gigs, and the money's fucking great.  So, I go down, and the first thing I always say, the second I walk into, you know, any  gig, you know what I do on stage.  You've got the material.  You've heard the CD.  Oh, yeah, we all listen to it.  That's what I'm going to do tonight.  They even have to sign a waiver to...  Yeah.  So, I do the show.  I do my show, you know, exactly the same way, and the crowd's laughing. 
[03:26:00]  They're into it.  Actually, you know, I didn't think it was going to...  It wasn't so bad.  They weren't...  But, of course, the president of the deal comes up.  But, you got a full standing ovation at the end.  I know.  I mean, the show was good for that environment, and then they came up, and they're like, we  just want to talk to you about the content.  Oh, boy.  The president of the company was not too enthused.  And then I'm like, okay, and he goes, if we make you a list for the next  show of things, and I was like, I'm not the guy for you. 
[03:26:30]  Obviously, you should, you know, call somebody who can come in and do what you need.  But, it's like, I gave you the shit.  Watch the stuff.  You know what I mean?  And if I'm not...  Now Dustin Diamond is doing the gig.  Yeah.  Oh!  No, I'm just kidding.  I wouldn't have doubted it, though.  So, no.  Did you get paid for the whole thing?  No.  I got paid for the first show.  I told him, keep the other half, and it was a mutual walk away.  You know someone's head rolled for that, too.  You know someone got the axe.  Who was the head of entertainment for that corporate gig?  It was some Missy down in personnel. 
[03:27:00]  And it could literally be just one little thing, and then they'll try not to pay you.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All kinds of things can happen.  Let's say hi to Sarah.  Get the Bacon Brothers.  They'll do it.  Remember we saw the Bacon Brothers at one of those...  They're on morning TV yesterday.  Corporate gigs.  ...promoting their singing thing.  Hey, Sarah, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I was at the Dane Cook and Bob Kelly show last night.  Granted, it wasn't exactly, you know, Bob Kelly show.  But it was so funny. 
[03:27:30]  My friend and I had such a great time.  And I just wanted to tell them that you guys were awesome.  And afterwards, it was...  Well, we thought it was pretty hysterical.  These two fat chicks come up to my friend Britt and I.  And they're like, we just flirted our way in and blah, blah, blah.  And I looked at them and I'm like, you look like you got in because you're one of Mari Povich's special children.  Not because you flirted your way.  They flirted their way in?  What, to the backstage or whatever?  Yeah, that's what they were telling us.  And it was pretty funny. 
[03:28:00]  And also, Dane Cook signed my friend's boobs.  And Bob Kelly did, too.  Yeah, very nice.  Sounds like a great night for everybody.  Everyone had fun.  We had so much fun.  But we have to say, like, my friend and I, like, we felt kind of bad because, you know,  Dane Cook was, like, leaving in, like, a limo or a town car or whatever.  And Bob Kelly was getting in a minivan.  I love it.  I can't wait to get Bob on the phone.  That's perfect.  No, we're trying to get Bob on the phone, but I don't know. 
[03:28:30]  He's probably sleeping or whatever.  So he sprained his wrist closing that sliding door on the van.  Yeah, Bob's not here, Sarah.  Oh, okay.  Well, I've been an ONA fan since you guys were on WNEW.  My brothers got me hooked on you guys.  I'm a huge fan.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  And I'm not an ugly chick.  That's a huge fan.  We'll meet you soon.  Thank you, Sarah.  Thank you, Sarah.  Thanks for coming down to the show.  All right.  Thanks so much, guys.  All right.  Yeah, I mean, Dane's killing.  We're all going to tonight's show.  I can't wait.  Which one are you guys coming into, the first or the second? 
[03:29:00]  11 o'clock show I'll be at.  Cool.  That's what I was told.  Yeah.  I said it's even better.  Late show's always a little bit better.  You know what I mean?  Late shows can be touch and go, though, because you've got the audience, you know.  Yeah.  A little more boozed up.  A little boozed up.  You can handle that, though.  Some comedians can't handle that.  Do we want to promote any of these other shows?  Loyola College tomorrow night?  That's a private gig.  All right.  Yeah.  October, what do we got?  October 7th, Colorado Convention Center.  That's supposed to be.  That's a pretty big gig. 
[03:29:30]  That's a pretty big venue.  Awesome.  And then ME is Maine, right?  Colby College, October 14th.  Yep.  In Waterville, Maine.  Yep.  And then the University of New Hampshire, October 15th.  Sure.  And the new city's called Retaliation.  UNH.  UNH, yeah.  UNH.  You guys want to listen to the Martha Stewart thing real fast?  Yeah, let's go.  Oh, there's Bobby.  Oh, Bobby's on.  All right.  Bob, what's up?  You tell that bitch it wasn't a minivan.  I got up to one of those little bike cabs. 
[03:30:00]  A bike cab.  I'm not even kidding you.  I had to take a fucking bike cab to the show last night.  Are you kidding?  There was no cabs at 6 o'clock, so I had to get this Polish dude on a bike.  To pedal you down there?  Yeah, and he looked at me.  I would walk first.  I asked him how much it was.  He looked me up and down.  He said, 20.  That's usually, what, 10?  It's probably around 5.  My fans saw him?  You saw Bob Kelly?  Yeah, I saw Bob Kelly getting pedaled by me on 42nd Street. 
[03:30:30]  Is that Nathaniel?  Yeah.  I saw him on the car.  I was like, Nathaniel.  No, he looked at me like, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, you called out to me.  You could have just pedaled by anonymously.  You thought it would be good to say hi.  Bob, you couldn't get on that big eight-person circular bicycle that rides through Times Square  that you want to fucking run over whenever I'm driving in the city?  No, there was nothing.  There was a brand new one, though.  It was brand new.  He said I was the first one ever on that bike.  Who cares?  You don't ever want to be seen in that thing. 
[03:31:00]  Well, what was I going to do?  Walk?  Do you stop to listen to the guys play the Spackle Buckets, too?  I'm sorry.  I didn't have a limo.  Pick me up at my five-star hotel.  You're not a fancy man.  Hey, Bob, we learned a lot about you today, thanks to Dane Cook.  You used to have very long hair.  Oh, shit.  Looking like, what did you say, Crystal Gale?  Oh, yeah.  Great reference today.  Crystal Gale.  He had long, long, luxurious hair.  Remember that, Bob?  You called me fucking Crystal Gale?  I called you Crystal Gale, man.  And you used to play the Punch in the Asshole game? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, but that was...  Dane invented that.  He came up to me one time and just punched me in the asshole.  And say, I just...  I'm going to shit my pants.  And then you ran with it.  And what did you do afterwards?  I made that up.  What did you say after that?  That's mine.  I trademarked it.  I sell it on my website.  You can buy a kit.  It's a home game.  Yeah, I used to have...  But Dane, you had long hair, too, man.  Yeah, I had kind of the mullet thing going.  There's a picture of you on the internet, bro.  Me and you both at the same time had... 
[03:32:00]  We looked like Charlie's Angels.  There was a...  There was a time when the mullet wasn't the mullet.  No, it wasn't.  It was just the haircut.  It was a feather.  Dennis Miller had that haircut for a long time.  That's right.  That's what it was.  And then it turned into this mullet.  Yeah.  Where all of a sudden to have it was to be just some backwards cross-eyed hick at a car show  or something.  I got to say, though, Dane's hair was beautiful in conditions.  Mine was nappy and curly. 
[03:32:30]  I do say that Dane had better hair than me.  Dane, you remember that time we picked up those two chicks at the beach?  Oh, my...  The witches?  Oh, my...  Me and Dane picked up two witches from Salem at the beach.  But Dane was always a conservative type of kid, and I was always like the creepy...  Right.  I want to lick somebody's ass all the way.  Like they had knife scars on their face, Bobby's chicks, you know?  Yeah.  So we wind up going back, but I'm the one always the aggressor with the chicks, and  Dane's kind of laid back, kind of always had a chick, and I'm the one, you know, banging 
[03:33:00]  broads all the time and talking about pussy, and we get back to their apartment in Salem,  and it's this...  Like this house has been there since 1702, and they're telling us...  They take us in the basement and tell us about the witches, and I'm shitting my pants.  We go back upstairs.  They both get naked, start taking showers.  Yeah.  I'm frantic.  I'm frantic.  Like Dane has the guitar in his hand, and they come out naked.  I'm like, dude, what the fuck are we going to do?  He goes, Bobby, get your fucking shit together. 
[03:33:30]  And just starts playing a song on the guitar.  He knows how to work it.  Get the guitar out, start playing a little.  Bobby's like, they're doing spells in there, man.  They're putting spells on us or something, dude.  He was so concerned that they were trying to really put some kind of...  How much coke had he done to paranoia himself up that much?  Yeah, when it comes time to gameplay, Dane really is the quarterback.  Get your shit together, faggot.  How are you girls doing?  Do you ever hear this song?  By Moody Blues?  Witchy Woman.  Moody Blues. 
[03:34:00]  This is Vixen's Edge of a Broken Heart.  Did you tell him that you shit in a bucket?  No.  Oh, now we're in the...  See, now we're in the...  Yeah, we're in the dirt.  We're in the good stuff now.  Who?  We're in the fucking tour...  You can't shit on the tour bus.  Yeah, you're not allowed to take crafts on the tour bus.  You're not allowed to shit on the tour bus whatsoever.  That's good.  We understand that, Raleigh.  And so I'm sitting there.  I'm on my computer.  Dane goes in the bathroom.  He comes out.  He goes, hey, dude, check this out.  He has a brand new sterling silver toilet bowl. 
[03:34:30]  And it's...  It was the...  It was so perfect, the shit, that I thought it was fake.  There was no, like, little...  You mean the wastebasket.  He showed you the wastebasket.  Yeah, I had the wastebasket, probably.  It was a...  Whatever.  Barry, shut your face.  You're not my manager, all right?  Shut your mouth.  Well, you did say that.  If you let him on the microphone again, I'll come down there right now and punch him right  in one tooth.  Hey, it was a wastebasket, buddy.  Listen, people are listening. 
[03:35:00]  I could do something for you.  You're going to be a big star.  You're going to be a big star.  You broke your knee.  This is going to put you on the map, buddy.  I'm thinking if we could dislocate your shoulder on the 4,000, I could get you on Carson  Daly.  God, that's how it works, though.  All right, so the shit in the wastebasket.  It was perfect.  You know, my weak stomach.  Yeah.  I didn't think it was real.  Oh, no.  But then I look in again, and I just saw a shit drip. 
[03:35:30]  And then his face.  Bobby gets that face when he's like, he wants to puke, but he starts getting that, like,  body in a river for three days look.  You know, it's just like...  His eyes look like a shark.  They just, like, turn black and glazy.  Who shits in a bucket?  Well, you got it.  He does.  Not on the bus.  What a great rule that is, though.  Because once someone shits on that bus, it's over.  It's over.  Well, these guys...  Anthony, I agree with that.  When you're doing 85 down some highway, but when you're parked next to the college and 
[03:36:00]  there's 98 toilets five feet away from you, there's no need to shit in the bus.  These guys locked me in my...  I know you guys locked me in the back room one night.  I had the back, you know, back room.  It was like a little sliding door.  And the bus was so dry that I bought one of those humidifiers.  And so I had to take a piss at, like, five in the morning.  We're moving.  I get up, and that door is jammed.  And I know these guys have, like, pinned it or done something.  So I'll lay down for, like, another hour, but now I've really got to go. 
[03:36:30]  And I'm like, I'm bang.  I'm like, come on, guys, with the engine.  And I say three hours later, I finally had to piss in my humidifier.  That's how bad it was.  I had to piss in my humidifier.  And it's all on film.  I hope you throw it away after that.  Yeah.  The bus driver.  What was his name again, Dan?  Brian.  Oh, this guy.  I love this.  This guy was the biggest creep.  I would wake up in the middle of the night and just go sit with him.  Like two weeks into the tour, he starts yelling at me. 
[03:37:00]  He goes, what the fuck kind of tour is this?  The fuck?  There's no alcohol.  There's no fucking drugs.  You guys aren't fucking whores.  What the fuck is it?  You're playing Xbox, you fucking bunch of faggots.  What was wrong with that guy?  I don't know, dude.  He just was.  He had driven like, you know.  Everybody.  Like Usher and like all these, you know.  Which means he gets the pussy that they don't want to fuck.  Right.  By the way, if Jimmy was here, he would have called out that Bob's story had no ending.  Had no nothing.  Well, apparently you just did. 
[03:37:30]  Thanks.  No, I was just saying if Jimmy was here, he would have done it.  Well, we're all looking around the studio uncomfortable.  I didn't point it out.  I pointed out that Jimmy would have pointed it out.  By doing that, you pointed it out.  Not at all.  You need like a little sound bite of Jimmy just being like nothing.  Shut up.  You got nothing.  Let it sit.  Good story, fat bro.  All right, Bob.  I guess we're going to let you go.  They're telling us you got to go.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You guys going tonight, right?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  Well, you know, the show's going to be great tonight. 
[03:38:00]  It's probably just going to be just as good as next week at Stress Factory in New Jersey,  where I'm headlining the 22nd to 22nd.  Nice slipping.  I'll see you guys later.  We'll see you tonight at the 11 o'clock show.  Take care.  Don't dislocate a toe at this show.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Do we have time to try this Martha Stewart thing?  Yeah, a little bit.  Why don't we try it?  What is she doing?  She's rapping with P. Diddy.  Yeah.  She's got some show that's like The Apprentice, only she's hosting it.  Yeah, something like that.  Yes, Than?  Yes, Than? 
[03:38:30]  Than knows.  I think she also has just sort of a talk craft show.  Oh, is that what it is?  It's for?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  She was wearing an M. Diddy belt buckle while this was going on.  Oh, my God.  M. Diddy diamond belt buckle.  She's M. Diddy.  And P. Diddy was there to help her out with some slang and language.  It's Miss Martha from Jersey City.  I'll bake you a cake and make your crib look pretty.  Mm-hmm.  I get smad respect like my man Big Diddy. 
[03:39:00]  I can't look at anybody.  I got the heaters running out of breath like when he ran the city.  Keep going.  They thought they could stop me, but they must be silly.  Silly.  I got my ankle bracelet off.  Now I'm free like Willie.  Yeah.  It's the Kmart queen, so I know you feel me.  They gave me love on the inside.  That's why they call me M. Diddy.  M. Diddy, baby.  Oh, no.  Don't clap.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I can't look at anybody. 
[03:39:30]  I can't look at any of you.  Oh, no.  I told you.  They're in the winger era.  Have you ever been so embarrassed for somebody that you don't want to make eye contact with  anybody lest they share that embarrassment and you have to acknowledge it?  What was worse, her rapping or his like?  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah, that's it.  That's going to get him the cred he needs.  Bad boy.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  Damn Diddy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  That hurt.  I don't like when things like that hurt.  Well, then Diddy Peaches.  Oh, it did.  Pain.  It starts teaching Martha Stewart some rhapsody.  Oh, Rochester.  I'm here with my bro Diddy and I'm so excited because he's going to teach me how to rap.  Now, I just want you to notice.  Wes, what are the security guards doing?  PB and J's.  Oh, they're eating.  See, they took me out.  That is so great.  Well, first of all, what I really want to know is what are the meanings of like these few words? 
[03:40:30]  Okay.  Cheddar.  Little 101.  Is Cheddar cheese?  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  I don't get the slang.  Cheddar's money.  The cheese.  Oh.  Cheddar.  Okay.  Cheddar's money.  Okay.  Shorty.  I have no idea.  I mean, you're, you're, I'm tallie.  Yeah, you're tallie.  Um, your, your, your, your daughter.  Oh, my God.  I've seen your daughter.  Yeah.  You know, I, I would call her a shorty.  Because she's like 60 tall?  No, no, no.  She's, um, young, pretty thing.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, she's a shorty.  What about nigga? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  What does that mean?  She's going to get booked on, uh, P. Diddy's Bad Boys at Comedy.  She'll be the next person to eat their balls on that show.  Pauly Singh.  Yeah.  Flawson.  Which is?  What you're doing right now with that $8 million piece of ice around your neck.  That's Flawson.  Benjamin's, um, which you make a lot of.  That's $100 bill.  That's money.  Oh, Benjamin Franklin.  Yeah, yes.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Hey.  That's a tie.  What do you have to do with, uh, not flossing your teeth? 
[03:41:30]  No, it's, flossing, flossing is just over the top.  Okay.  So it's just, it's means white guy voice.  And then ballin'.  Wow.  I mean, I know what ballin' is.  And you know she's pretending to be that.  What is it to rap?  Oh, okay.  Ballin' to rap is living life to the fullest.  It's just, you know, um.  Oh, okay.  You work hard.  Having a ball.  You play, there you go.  Work hard, you play hard.  Ooh.  Wow, that is harsh. 
[03:42:00]  What is he doing?  Diddy in, uh, glass bags.  Just aligned.  He's got his own, uh, Ziploc line coming out.  The Diddy.  Diddy zip.  Keeps all your food chill.  With a fragrance.  Keeps it fresh, yo.  Keeps it all fresh.  Yo, fresh.  Wow.  That is horrible.  Biggie should come back from the dead and shoot him.  He's gonna be trying.  Yeah.  He's trying.  Yeah, he should come back from the dead and sit on him.  Just kill it.  There is no reason that he should be hanging out with Martha. 
[03:42:30]  Wow.  How bad.  What happened?  What happened to the rap world?  Thank God there's a few guys out there killing each other to keep the whole thing real.  Because they, the, the, the pioneers, the guys that were in there pretty early, they've just all turned into nothing.  Yeah, I, a kizzle.  I'll tee off.  I'll golf with you.  Make sure you buy a dodge.  Oh, all those guys.  It's so, it's so embarrassing. 
[03:43:00]  See what they were, were doing a while back.  Oh, we're, we're in the countdown.  We're done with the show today.  Uh, Brian in Dallas.  Real fast.  Yeah, hey, I was just wondering when, uh, Dane's going to come down here to the improv and when the Torgasm DVD comes out.  Dallas?  Uh.  Yeah.  Be around Dallas sometime?  All right, man.  We're putting a big, uh, retaliation tour together.  Uh, hopefully it'll start, uh, sometime, uh, into the fall.  And as far as Torgasm, we're editing it together and we'll just, uh, we'll see, uh, it'll be done when it's done.  It's going to take a little while. 
[03:43:30]  I don't think he's going to be playing the improv anytime soon.  You know where the Cowboys play football?  You might want to, uh, look for him there.  He, Dane Cook, is blowing up.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah.  Two shows.  All right, Brian.  Thanks, guys.  Well, we're running out of show here.  Dane, this was a pleasure, man.  Thank you so much for coming by.  Finally.  We've had you on the phone a few times, but in studio, it's great.  Much gooder.  We'll be at the show tonight, and of course, everyone should look for a retaliation in their, their old, uh, record stores. 
[03:44:00]  CD and DVD, right?  Yes.  Anything else we want to promote there, Barry?  No.  We did good, we did good for you, right, Barry?  Thank you so much.  I love you guys.  It's been a long time.  We haven't seen Barry in a few years.  You guys have been big stars.  Yeah.  We'll do some things with Barry in the coming months.  You never know.  And of course, Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton.  Bravo, Phil.  Good job.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun with Bill the last couple of days.  You're going to do the whole, uh, week next week?  Yeah.  We got Bill getting up for all he's like.  Yeah.  The novelty wears off already, and he's just like hot. 
[03:44:30]  And I already did this morning, I was like, they do this every fucking day.  Oh, we're done.  HBO tonight.  Bill Burr.  Program complete. </pre>
