<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a phone call featuring Bob Levy and in-studio guest Jim Florentine.  Their conversation was dominated by sexually explicit and outrageous anecdotes about their experiences on the road, including elaborate schemes to meet and sleep with women,  lying about their identities, and even sharing women.  Levy recounted a particularly memorable incident where he unintentionally shared a bed with a couple, while Florentine shared various encounters, one involving a woman who mistook him for another man.  The comedians discussed their shared experiences, including a story where a prank resulted in accidentally hiring a prostitute, and their nickname, "The Load Warriors." They also talked about meeting Bob Saget and Jeff Bridges, praising the latter highly. The segment concluded with more sexually explicit anecdotes and a discussion about their bowel habits.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about fitness and Dice Clay's career resurgence, featuring Chris Hardwick as a guest.  The conversation included humorous exchanges about personal trainers, Dice Clay's workout routine, and graphic descriptions of sexual preferences.  Dice Clay discussed his recent success, including his role in a Woody Allen film, his podcast "Rolling with Dice and Wheels" (featuring collaborations with Tom Green and Joe Rogan), a new talent show, and a forthcoming book.  He also touched upon his past struggles and current fitness journey.  Chris Hardwick mentioned his own podcast and television show, and his love of chess.  The hosts and guests engaged in further off-color jokes and banter.

Next, comedian Colin Quinn joined as a guest, initially discussing a Chip Hardwick-curated Opie and Anthony archive piece.  The conversation quickly shifted to Quinn's new play about the Constitution, which the hosts initially heckled before grilling him about.  They discussed the play's venue, previews, and potential tours, along with tangents about Quinn's appearance on Rachel Ray, a heated exchange about veiled racism, scheduling conflicts, a feud with Conan O'Brien, and extensive discussion of Irish Traveller culture and fighting traditions, using offensive language and stereotypes. The conversation also involved anecdotes about Jim Norton, including a bizarre gum-in-tea incident.  Daryl Hammond then joined, discussing his book ("If You're Not Up There, I'm Fucked"), an upcoming documentary, a severe car accident, his struggles with trauma and addiction, and his therapy. He also detailed deeply personal and traumatic experiences related to his mother’s abuse and his own resulting self-harm, as well as his father’s experiences with PTSD and death. He discussed his experiences working with Dr. Phil and a book signing overshadowed by *Fifty Shades of Grey*, along with his impressions of former Presidents, and a humorous crack cocaine experience.  The segment concluded with a discussion about his impressions and struggles with a Bush impression.

A segment followed focused on impressions, with an unnamed guest and a studio guest, Jay, who performed a Colin Quinn impression.  The discussion included Rich Little, Kevin Pollack (his Shatner impression was highlighted), Frank Caliendo (his George W. Bush impression was deemed the best), and the challenges of impression work.  The unnamed guest shared personal anecdotes, and the search for an online video of his John McCain impression became a recurring humorous, frustrating segment involving the show’s sound tech, Sam.  Later, Joel McHale joined, discussing his experiences on *Community*, including an anecdote where he injured Chevy Chase.  The conversation included tangents about Chevy Chase, Daniel Tosh, and a bizarre commercial for "Tin Roses," leading to McHale using the rose to cut through objects.  The segment concluded with discussions of online videos (a hatchet attack and a tasing incident), talk show hosts, and the state of television.

The final segment involved a discussion about radio and TV announcers’ voices, particularly JJ Walker’s loud introductions.  The hosts debated the importance of the announcer’s voice versus the music. They also discussed the accessibility of information online.  Later, Kevin Hart joined as a guest, along with Jim Norton, Bobby Kelly, and Keith Robinson.  Hart recounted anecdotes about his career, wealth, and interactions with other comedians, including Chris Rock and Robert De Niro.  The conversation included humorous exchanges and teasing between Hart and the hosts, along with promotional mentions of Hart’s TV show, "Real Husbands of Hollywood," and the Opie and Anthony show's "A Very Chipperson Thanksgiving" special.  The conversations included offensive language and jokes throughout.  The show ended shortly thereafter.

[00:30:30]  way they look at a lens at a lens yeah i want to be a lens i don't want to look at me the way they  look at the scope of a rifle though just total fear yeah it's just revulsion or was it was it a woman  welcoming i'm on fallon tomorrow not the show oh that's just on him that's cool yeah i used to do  merv griffin show whenever you would go i'm on the merv griffin show i'm on merv griffin not the show  it actually applied yes it did yes well because he was uh he was good to me what years did you do his 
[00:31:00]  show oh god said 82 to like i was on it 13 times really i was on carson 13 times i was about to ask you  because i just saw a carson documentary last night it's amazing yeah yeah what's your thoughts on  carson i loved carson and he was uh you know it was a what did they show his personality in it that  they yes yes kind of they go into that bit of a quiet caramuchin yes yeah but it sounded like his 
[00:31:30]  fame pushed him that way where he finally just kind of it did people and he's not the guy that's like  hey hey good to see everybody you know yeah yeah because he was a guy that used to be out and about  when he was younger yeah hollywood especially and then like uh the that fame just made him close  down and kind of isolate himself but he was so good at that gig right oh my god and by the end he  had basically no friends and even his wife he you know that he really loved the last one there he  distanced but he lost his kid too so that was a terrible yeah he won i think he had said to uh 
[00:32:00]  to his wife or wife-to-be at one point he said i don't want to do this these shows are all  consuming to joanna yeah you just yeah you he knew what it was to get into that show and if it  was successful he knew that would become his life period that's it right and that's exactly  what happened to the guy and he wanted it i mean he loved doing it i used to talk to him he was  really really kind to me i mean i was talking to him that was someone that i idolized that i was  god got over you talked to him what backstage or yeah before the show what kind of conversations 
[00:32:30]  that's really interesting stuff um but one time it was uh i thought i was like bombing on the air  and i said hey i i wasn't too good he goes oh you were good they were they were just they suck  tonight and i went well what do you what do you do and he goes oh you just uh you got tomorrow night  it's always tomorrow and then um he probably felt it in the monologue or something and knew that  they just weren't a great crowd yeah you could tell right away it was no different than what we do  you just know but um he was really kind to me he's funny i would tell stories that didn't stop 
[00:33:00]  you know i was like the nephew that would come on and just tell stories you know so so i'm in there  with my uh my kids and he's like i said this is true he goes i don't care just tell it  he would have said tell the fucking story  and there was a music act i remember just sitting and talking to him i remember i have the same  memories kind of with letterman years later would do that show a lot  also and and i'd known david from the comedy store and stuff from years before but carson was 
[00:33:30]  that's an icon that i never thought i'd ever be sitting and talking right like like that how did  it feel to sit in that seat well it was funny was i i kind of knew ed kind of because he kind of knew  my family in philly and the first time i did it i believe it was the first time i did it was with  gary shandling he was guest hosting and then i did it again with johnny and then i did it once with  jay and then i did total of 13 with johnny as i remember and then johnny was uh it was two weeks  before he was going off the air and i brought him a watch uh as a joke and it said 30 years of great 
[00:34:00]  service on it and i handed it to him oh this is very nice thank you 30 years of great service and  then i took out 16 more watches identical watches like it was just a piece of shit i gave one to ed  and then bill calls we came on afternoons give me my watch and i started jumping on it and trying  to break it there were thrown watches all over the place like it was shit but he was um took me out to  his car once and showed me his corvette yeah that's my that's my new car he just he didn't seem that 
[00:34:30]  happy but he loved loved funny people and that's what it looked like and responded well because he  knew that i loved him and i didn't invade his privacy i was just i would just listen to him in  the in the documentary they talk about how uh somebody had mentioned that watching someone be  funny on the show it was great because you got to see a funny person but it was also watching johnny  legitimately laughing at it made it even better and made it feel like like it was real you were in it 
[00:35:00]  you were there laughing with somebody that you cared about and just a weird that whole time period  and everything he was an institution man that that just will never there wasn't any competition  there wasn't that he was the guy yeah no no explain how arsenio hall bit off it a little bit  took a little he did a pretty amazing thing arsenio yeah arsenio was a real competitor there for a  little bit but uh i want to talk about the comedians again when he would call you over  everyone talks about the comic being called over after doing a stand-up right who are the who are the 
[00:35:30]  sad saps that didn't get called over because now it's obvious everyone knows about johnny calling the  comedian over if you really like them that's the whole big thing i only did panel so i was really  really lucky oh you never did stand up on the show they wouldn't put me on the talent coordinator told  me when i was trying to get on for like 10 years i couldn't get on when i finally had some television  of consequence then i would come on as a guest just to talk to him but they said my uh the jim jim  mccauley who passed away he was a nice man he was a talent coordinator said your act is like a stone 
[00:36:00]  skipping on the water it doesn't quite dig in oh shit i i wanted to stand up i don't want a  pumpkin speech from i can kung fu i don't fucking need that i just want to get on the night show  he brought your cassette back to you and told you to go out and get some nightclub work and do some  work and we'll send somebody out to see you uh as soon as we can send us the tape yeah do you have  a link i'll wait but your comedy is also you know it's like edgier well it was it was it when it was  then it was uh just three associations so it didn't find it and it still was edgy it was 
[00:36:30]  like my first joke was uh i have the brain of a german shepherd in the body of a 16 year old boy  and they're both in my car and i want you to see them that was a joke that's not a joke but you know  this is someone you say if you're fucked up right and people would laugh at it kind of because like  what's wrong with this guy yeah but uh yeah i love the documentary and then it got into his  relationship with his mom who oh man apparently she could have given him a little more support 
[00:37:00]  just a little bit would have been nice she was uh yeah like just not he wanted her to be proud of  what he did and and anybody you think would be i mean what he achieved but even as a even as he got  older he just couldn't get her approval or she i guess she was watching the monologue with somebody  that was writing a story about time magazine time magazine somebody you know a little publication  yeah yeah time magazine and uh they're watching the monologue together the writer and the mother  and and done with the monologue and she goes yeah she said that wasn't funny that wasn't funny 
[00:37:30]  and walked out of the room and walked out of the room holy shit and it wasn't even like a joke  thing where she comes back then it goes ah right and the writer's just oh my god you think she  wanted to be famous i don't know maybe frustrated by that she's just an obvious narcissist  but but and not a person that understands anything i mean that's an ego battle well  yeah yeah jealous that your kid has a right right yeah yeah but it's more complicated than that we  were discussing documentary yesterday thanks to anthony brought to my attention i went right home and 
[00:38:00]  god uh watched it uh when she died the mom she had a box in the closet with all his shit all his  press clippings she saved everything so she so in a way johnny carson was like oh okay maybe she can  express you know what she was feeling for me and my breath but in the end she did show how proud  she was because she saved it all and then uh they said johnny took that box put it in his closet and  it remained there until you know he died probably masturbated to it oh god what about what about uh his 
[00:38:30]  dad they didn't really go into the dad that much they didn't there was a good role model positive guy  yeah it was very simple stuff this footage of johnny i'm sorry this footage of johnny from back in  like the 40s and you know the early 40s doing magic tricks around the house it's amazing that  people had some of the footage was amazing watch him did they show the thing with sammy davis jr  and frank and at uh in st louis they did an amazing show and johnny was the mc and he wasn't killing i  mean he was doing he was young he hadn't i might have just started i've seen some of that  a game show and he was just a fresh spry good-looking guy that was just like yeah they did 
[00:39:00]  yeah yeah he was kind of awkward in front of the camera gangly and likable yeah yeah but you wouldn't  expect him to become what he became yeah that intersection doesn't happen and where was he from  uh nebraska nebraska because they his father really wasn't in that a lot but they said something about  like somebody from uh uh the dad that he was he was the type of guy from nebraska that uh loved his  family so much he almost told them jay leno said that it was the jay leno he loved his family so 
[00:39:30]  much he almost told he almost told them that's a great lie he loved his wife so much he almost told  yeah that was it that's what's sad is that people don't right right i mean i guess it's ethnicity too  because some i mean jewish italian people maybe get a little more gregarious and how much  it's a cultural thing but a person from the midwest doesn't go around hugging their family  no no that's what sets people off who are the guys you came up with at the comedy store you 
[00:40:00]  mentioned letterman but who else was in your little group like jimmy has his group yeah that comes in  here and we're well we had i had a lot of a lot of friends actually kennison i helped get his first  spot at the comedy store wow and michael richards i helped get his first spot at the improv i helped  get him his last spot the laugh factory well you can do so much with a good iphone  and uh i was friends with mike binder who was all right filmmaker and uh a lot of people shandling was 
[00:40:30]  a friend i mean i was not close but hung out with seinfeld and one time i took everybody disneyland  george wallace seinfeld channeling i took everybody disneyland we were like 24 years old  i just wanted to be like some faggy cheerleader you know i was just all idealistic and happy  come on guys we're all comics yeah let's make people laugh tonight it's like no bob we're  supposed to be miserable when we're not on stage stop it but you knew these guys bob don't you know 
[00:41:00]  about coke but you knew these guys before obviously they were famous i always find that fascinating  i would sit in the back of the room with this i would sit there and uh billy crystal was really  nice to me and he had just gotten on soap and and we were sitting watching people and what prior was  going on so i would and i started mceeing a lot so i would bring up robin a lot and uh robin was  getting he had just gotten laughing too george slatter did the song to laugh that's right so robin did that 
[00:41:30]  and and letterman went off to go do his morning show on nbc he was really nice what year is all  this like 70 78 79 and leno was really nice i mean i know leno is is a guy that was just the  construction workers favorite comedian you know you don't stay in a denim shirt right right what's  going on with these people yeah it was it was fun there were a lot of a lot of what's the obsession  with the denim shirts i think he's i think he's just he's got a hundred of them it works like he  probably feels that's my pattern and they said johnny was like that too though very very ritualistic 
[00:42:00]  very routine every 10 a.m call fred to court of every he did the exact same thing every day and  when you get that gig i imagine you're like i got this gig don't fuck it up so whatever worked  yesterday hopefully will work today well it's interesting because i'm going to talk about that  a little bit on found tomorrow night the guy got the spot i mean it's pretty on and it tells you it's  unbelievable and i understand it because i it's a crazy thing i like it because it goes into a 
[00:42:30]  little more variety show type thing it brings a little bit i'm not a game lover i don't want to  see people do bar things on tv or whatever i like a chat show people just do this but i also like that  i used to love 10 o'clock at night dean martin show i used to love an attempt at people coming on just  fucking around different musicians come out and just doing whatever so if there's that kind of element to a  show where god bless jonathan winters someone like that can walk in knock on the door and just 
[00:43:00]  fuck around yeah yeah if the people that run the show are big enough if it's a dean martin type person  and jimmy does that kind of thing i don't know he just went right like right to the top he's awesome  it's amazing he comes in to do this show uh and he and he's a nice guy yeah genuinely yeah he came in  to do our show when they were kind of experimenting with it on the on the internet remember he was  doing test shows and now look what he's doing online it was online they were like feeling it out 
[00:43:30]  that's when we met him for the first time and now look at him holy i met him he was in la and uh  it was funny i was on oprah and i was they had five comedians discovering people and i was discovering  guy named bob oshack who i need to discover again really funny comedian great guy and uh bill murray  was on and bill murray via tape uh discovered jimmy fallon said that was the guy that he wanted to  discover and jimmy had just started on snl he was the one of the one of the new guys and and bill 
[00:44:00]  marr had somebody he discovered i can't remember but it was uh i went into i didn't know jimmy i went into  oprah's uh booth and put on a headset and said hey jimmy i really like your work and just started  trying to talk dirty to him because we were on the satellite hit at oprah so it just felt like  something bad to do i had my balls were happy to fill that day i was all i'm at oprah and i'm using  their room as a telephone call but um i met him oh the first time i met him i think we did a show 
[00:44:30]  um in bryant park it was uh an outdoor show obviously and um i went up i've and it bombed  completely and the other guy i was working with bombed completely and no one knew jimmy he i think  just again maybe just got snl and uh they're like this next guy and he was a guitar act and we don't  mean either comic i'll go oh yeah but he did great he really got laughs and there you go you could see 
[00:45:00]  he was really funny there's nothing worse than when you guys bomb and the other guy kills so it's  like oh it wasn't totally the crowd it was possible to entertain them they really wanted to be  entertained i was that guitar act i could never take the guitar off when i started i used to sing  while my guitar gently weeps and i had a valve with a shampoo bottle filled with water i would turn it  and water would pour out of my guitar so it was common common combination of you know gallagher  right and a music act and i was hated so bad i was at the improv one night and larry david is before 
[00:45:30]  larry did fridays even was standing there and larry was very we'd get very amped up before going on  didn't and didn't always like kind of was caustic toward the audience even before so he would  be like that and somebody was on stage and i'm standing next to larry holding a guitar so it's a  scene basically from curb it really felt like it larry's watching the guy on stage and we're right  there it's like in the improv in la you're too close to the stage and all the comics are just  looking and you're you're kind of lit it's just weird and larry's going oh they're laughing at this 
[00:46:00]  guy i don't know if i want to go on and and he said this police people are fucking stupid you know  and they want a fucking guitar act and i looked and i had a guitar and he didn't even realize he'd said  it and he looked at me and then i went oh uh huh and then i was like i was like 23 i'm just so  hurt at least it didn't have an impact on your life where you remembered it oh my god well i also agreed  with him i wish i didn't have the guitar because i was going to go up and do like fucking parodies 
[00:46:30]  a piece just a piece of shit that i was and then uh of course my new special has a lot of music on it  but um but then larry went on stage right after this guy who did jokes that larry didn't like and  larry was right he was completely right the guy was doing real feed the audience pablum stuff  and larry started and went oh it's just hilarious very known for doing this yeah oh so it is it is  you people or someone like he's you know what oh wow it is you i don't even remember what the joke 
[00:47:00]  was i just remember him going fuck you and next thing i knew they said ladies and gentlemen bob  he was gone and there i was with my guitar there's feeling like i he was right and this is gonna  work and i'm a piece of comedic shit there's so many stories yeah of course i killed pitching like  that but it was you know i would do just parodies that's he would leave the stage yeah just yell at  the audience pitch in the middle of doing something he would just go ah fuck this and walk off the stage 
[00:47:30]  it's like what the he was that doesn't get you so funny it doesn't get you anywhere  tracy's always does the opposite tracy would be like well even the virus tour but he would go uh  i'm gonna walk him bobby i went why are you gonna walk i'm gonna talk about things i've never heard  abortion but now they've heard that i'm gonna walk they're gonna leave i went well why do they have  to leave because they're gone to bobby you'll see but i think that's a saver to make sure that i i've  never wanted people to leave right not at all no not not until i fuck them then i would love 
[00:48:00]  them as soon as i'm wiping come off with a sock i want them putting on their shoes i saw tracy  morgan at carolines and he wasn't having a good set so he decided to talk about his pubic hair for  20 minutes not a minute not two minutes for 20 minutes he would not stop and then there's a lot  to talk about he was basically going to every girl in the front row asking if they wanted to see  his pubic hair and he made it into a thing and he turned the whole fucking place around that's  nice damn by the way jim i was gonna say how you beat me by a half a second oh my god that's right 
[00:48:30]  obviously he's actually he named his shit after me i bet you it's as tall as me  i bet more mass of his own body is coming out of him what if he created an exact opposite  it just comes out of him this twin his shit twin he shit his own twin out i finally that's a great  movie you got something on that a lot of people don't know this but he told me he's been holding  this since last night why oh that's what he does why does he hold well he wasn't in labor till this 
[00:49:00]  morning yeah no he does weird things like that he holds his shit yeah we're gonna have to ask him  when he comes back well that's a problem i don't know that's bad for you you can get hemorrhoids  you can get um you get bowel cancer from holding shit it shows you know what shit's got in it  shit you don't want to keep that in you as soon as i get that feeling as soon as i get that feeling  it's time to get rid of it i love getting rid of it fuck yeah it's fucking awesome even people say 
[00:49:30]  don't do it on a plane but i'm so good at anything like i'm yoga yoga's like helped me yeah i don't  even do yoga but you don't care at home i i rehearse basically my yoga is just in training for  airplane shitting squat squatting bob you gotta get it done with quick one of uh life's simple  pleasures is when you can't cut it loose and you get a nice long one and it's over huh oh you mean  it just stays there forever i mean you think you're you're you're snapping off logs but it turns out to 
[00:50:00]  be one nice really long one and then you got a little amazement in your life for the day well hold  on i'm still caught on the end you don't like this stuff anthony anthony's trying to figure out  if you like the sensation of keeping it in there oh no no no no no i'm talking when you're when it's  a giant tube stick yeah you're releasing but you know you're not cutting off individual logs it  becomes one really long but see i can't relate to this because you need to know as as he's dropping  logs he flushes immediately while he's still sitting on the toilet i have i do that sometimes i like 
[00:50:30]  i don't want to see what i did you know i like to look and make sure i'm not there's no glass in it  but you know like i ate rocks yeah jimmy what happened jimmy smiling well i gotta be honest um i never  experienced anything like this that's 20 minutes yeah i i take slow shits but i went upstairs i would  say not a great one it was one of those ones where you know it's gonna be like i felt like i was forcing  out baby carrots covered in peanut butter oh jesus did you eat either of those things 
[00:51:00]  everything turns to peanut butter i eat a lot of baby carrots he loves the ones in the package yeah  that's what so that was it orange yeah no no no i'm saying if they were small and uh it was just  hard to get it all going and i'm like oh boy is wiping gonna be a nightmare like you know nothing's  worse than when your shit uh sounds like you just threw pebbles in the water yeah oh bag of rocks  mine sounded like uh it sounded like you had soaked a golf ball in peanut butter and you were 
[00:51:30]  rolling it down a peanut butter gutter does that like mousetrap what about my mother's old and i  probably shouldn't talk about this but sometimes i'll take her to the restroom somewhere and i'll  drop her off and it's like the act itself for an older person is probably about 12 seconds tops  but the maintenance can be 45 minutes because there's old flesh you have to get uh-huh is that  did you have a lot of wait wait wait wait wait you're putting a fanny pack did you shit in that 
[00:52:00]  fanny pack pop hold on a second you're giving us way too much material have you had to wipe your  mom's no i have not not not uh i mean i do it electively okay whether she needs it or not yeah yeah  actually i'm starting a website yeah it's uh wipe my mom's ass dot com i've been able to dot net i  have dot com i've been able to avoid it but there are family members that might have had to wipe my  mom's ass yeah my mom shits her pants she's gonna have to fucking hose out i love it i can't wipe her 
[00:52:30]  how about how about how about how about this people marrying into our family had to do with  your mom no yes because it's a girl is your mom alive now i think so but someone has to wipe her  ass yeah i think she might still be she can't i'm in town i'm saying i could come over oh you want  to give it a shot i would are you kidding i'd love to wipe your mom's ass some of my sister-in-law  friends some of my sister-in-law's have had a yeah damn it was hard to wipe my ass today because i

[01:05:30]  great is he great he was great he let me do what i'm supposed to do uh-huh you know what i mean and  you know from what i'm reading it's almost like embarrassing you know well you know what i i really  showed up to do a great job because i knew the kind of like actors i was going to work with huge you  know what i mean you're working with alec and cape blanchard and you know these are the you know  sally hawkins golden globe winners uh-huh so i was like i really got to bring an a game and i didn't 
[01:06:00]  do a movie in 12 years jesus you know but you know when i see these like you know the wall street  journal you know the way to write me up and you know i'm like this is the craziest thing i've ever  been involved you know what i'm seeing here dice and i'm not kidding around either no with this i know  we're just talking this could be the fucking john travolta pulp fiction thing for you but that's  what they're saying they're talking about mickey rock and the wrestler but uh-huh but i'm like  these guys i mean guys like mickey rock to me are the best yeah yeah i mean you know to me he's one 
[01:06:30]  of the greatest actors just ever he just is yeah you know so i understood that and he's the star of  that movie you know what i mean yeah and even though travolta you know was a supporting role in pulp  fiction it was still a giant part sure you know what i mean and so i get but wait you know this  is really it set me back a little i'm i'm pretty like overwhelmed a little humbled very humbled yeah  yeah i mean i'm talking to you now just straight i mean i i feel like i really hope i did as good a 
[01:07:00]  job as what he's been saying and and and that's all i wanted to do what's uh what's you know because  well you know he's he's a very regular guy you know what i mean he's a guy that's  gone through a lot of stuff which i can relate to you know but you know i i had to go pretty deep  you know it's like i got my own method of acting i know how to get there but you know i i just can't  believe the press on this yeah yeah you know i mean the ap came out uh associated press the other 
[01:07:30]  night to take pictures when i was in vegas at vinyl which i've done the ap before yes and they never  send anybody to take pictures and the guy said honestly dice this is the biggest story in showbiz  right now wow i'm like you're kidding me you know because i'm playing vinyl i'm in at the hard rock in  vegas and i'm like this is all going on around me i like don't even get it you know and big premiere  yeah i haven't felt this honestly since since 88 since the rodney special see when the rodney special 
[01:08:00]  aired i knew what had happened you know that i would even talk to dennis back then when he you  know when i was doing like rascals 28 shows in a row and he was looking to put me like in 500 seat  rooms and i'm like it's bigger than that and i think the only way to prove it was to have him put  me on sale somebody somewhere else in the country because he felt it was territorial and he put me  in phoenix at the theater uh celebrity theater one show but they sold three in one day and that's 
[01:08:30]  when he realized this isn't normal you know and i haven't had that feeling i feel very like uh  like elevated like my whole mind my whole mood about this whole thing it's time i mean and  like you know people have been asking me like what if you had to pick like three things  in your career that really would mark you i said well the rodney special because that just blew me  through the roof hell yeah then when i was doing the arenas you know led to madison square garden 
[01:09:00]  yeah and now this woody movie because it's it's the shot of a lifetime oh shit but i didn't know  when i was doing it i just really wanted to do a great job for him how did you read for him because  if woody doesn't like a performance yeah he'll throw it out and just cast somebody else  and reshoot it yeah he did that's a crammer well i you know but that's that's what he does that's  why his movie like he'll go the guy's not getting it get rid of him and get me the right actor yeah  you know so when i'm on that set it's like just do a great job these pretzels are making me thirsty 
[01:09:30]  something like that you deliver the line like that oh but that's not that's not what i'm doing i know  how did you how did you read for him you meet with him and then he just hands you a script i hear  i went in there and it was very loose and he was with the uh casting lady and the producer  and he was very cool very laid back and you know we're doing a film and uh would you read a few  pages you know and i'm like can you give me something to go on you know and he goes well 
[01:10:00]  you know he's you just take a look you know and and i went in another room with the casting i went  through two pages i said i got this let's go in but she was like uh are you sure because i only  went through it the one time but i could see what it was so i do it for him and i go look i don't even  know if the guy's from the east coast i don't you know i don't know anything if you want i'll do it  again and he goes well you have the essence it was perfect and i was like all right you know i guess 
[01:10:30]  i'll see you on the set you know but when i when i actually got the text that i didn't even open it  from my manager uh bruce you know and i just saw you got the you know uh it was an emotional thing  for me wow you know because you know number one it's like something my parents would have always  wanted to see me do anytime i would do a movie i mean my mother loved that i was the comic i am and  but like if i get a movie she'd go is it is it a drama yes she loved dramatic she knew i could do the 
[01:11:00]  drama yeah and i go well mom i'm a comic it's it's like a comedy you know but this is like something  they would have just loved i mean you know i could just see them talking about it you know  i've seen you act you know and and act like you know where you wouldn't even know it wasn't you're  talking about like crime story years ago but even that was more animated yeah yeah yeah you know this  isn't as animated but i saw no even like early way early on like in fucking mash when you were in  mash i remember that it was like fucking holy shit that was their last halloween episode was it yeah

[01:29:30]  much because of all these other things going on i mean i don't know with other movies but i'll do  the tv show uh i got the book coming out uh may 2014 uh uh the filthy truth that i'm writing with  david ritz and you know there's a guy that wrote books like ray charles they made the movie from the  book uh edit james smoky robinson yeah marvin gay uh he actually wrote the lyrics to sexual healing  you know which became one of them all and he wrote the book on marvin who wrote the lyrics 
[01:30:00]  that's my favorite marvin david ritz oh wow okay david ritz wrote wrote that song because he heard  the groove of the song and he was writing the book on marvin and marvin asked him i don't know if he  didn't ask him to write lyrics like what do you think and he said it's sexual and he wrote the work  he's a great writer he just got done with joe perry's book and now he's finishing up my book  you know the filthy truth and there is a mention of you in there oh good book book of course special 
[01:30:30]  dvd movie and i and a show is a lot going on podcast i don't know what the fuck is going on  you're fucking how come during the lean years you were heavy and now you're doing a lot because i had  to get back in the heavy years and now you're thin well think about it you know what i you know in  and look in the book i do it's the filthy truth i talk about you know from like 95 to just you know 
[01:31:00]  three years ago i was i was in a living hell you know life takes turns you know you get derailed  things like that and but i never lost the fire in me i never lost that that feel to accomplish  you know what i mean so yeah i might have got heavy but it took that same guy to take it off  yeah you know nobody could do that but it's not even about taking the weight it's about just being  physically fit that when i get on stage people will see yeah i might not have as much hair 
[01:31:30]  you know what i mean remember that remember when you could put a comb to your head and there was  actual hair on it you know how i pick on guys in the crowd i go remember when you could stand  your feet and feel your fucking toes remember when you touched your dick and it actually got  hard at that second you didn't have to beg it the fuck up looking at my dick three in the morning  get the fuck up we ain't done here my friend take a look at her  no but you know what i'm saying so so it's like i owed it to myself and the people that love to come 
[01:32:00]  watch me perform to look right that's why i got in the shape i did for the special you did you find  that sometimes you gotta you just have to put the time in like enough time has to go by where people  not forget who you were but can move past the the early dice and now you could just it's a whole  different game so like but but you could but i think only time does that you gotta fucking sit it out  you know what you know um you know it's like i don't i don't even want to read my press right now 
[01:32:30]  because like years ago when we were touring with norton kenny the whole thing and it was all bad  press you know what i mean so i just stopped reading it uh-huh that's how i feel with the  good press you know because i would read those articles years ago and go but they don't even  fucking know me so what do i give a shit what they think you know what i mean so today they're  writing great stuff that's great but i don't have to read it i know me you know i know the things i  talk to them about and if they write it up the right way it'll be a good interview when people write 
[01:33:00]  things if it's good i mean this thing that's out now they're perfect did you see the playboy thing  yet did you read the playboy too yeah yeah and that's like a six seven page profile i mean they're  writing these things now that are pretty unbelievable to me but i don't want to get overwhelmed by it i  just want to yeah yeah yeah you know like you know with with all this press that was coming  with the woody movie coming i got kind of overwhelmed you know and i would talk to my wife and my kids and  you know people the closest to me and you know my son dylan said it the best like about a month ago 
[01:33:30]  shut up dad and quit whining no he said no it wasn't about whining it was about like hearing about  yourself too much it was like too overwhelming again i was used to being where i was at you know  for the last like 12 years and my son dylan he goes you know what dad just own it that's why you  started in this to start with so just own it now and he was right and the next day i woke up i was 
[01:34:00]  like all right bring it on yeah this is what's you know meant to go on this is great well it's uh  unbelievable you got so much going on it's fantastic we got it we got to wrap up because uh  we're done here we cover everything yeah i think we did nothing but the most memorable ona  appearances from the biggest names in comedy just another sign of the absolute disintegration  and decay of this country a very chippers in thanksgiving will continue with that on the open  anthony channel 
[01:34:30]  nothing but legendary appearances from the biggest names in comedy a very chippers in thanksgiving  continues here's your host lyle chip chippers in this segment is chris herdwalk is talking about  the nerdized the podcast and tv show and him and jim narden talk about cheese and with other 
[01:35:00]  things i was on tv i'm a ghost back to you chris yes sir we're talking about podcasts yes sir talking  about walking dead what else is going on in your world we do the nerdist tv show for bbc america yeah  when did that start that started well that started in 2011 we did a handful of specials and then and then  now it's on for you know for for 10 weeks and it's sort of an expanded version of the podcast that's fun 
[01:35:30]  i don't like having uh guys like you in because it just makes me more frustrated with this with the  with how awful this place is how did but how did you turn the podcast into what did you what you  didn't wait for somebody else to do what did you do that's our idea we're like look we do so much  visual stuff we could easily get a half hour a week an hour a week yeah and it doesn't have to be  on some massive over-the-top network either well i for us it was um i'm a huge doctor who fan and so  that's how i you mean mfawesome says the guy who follows uh chess matches uh fair enough i have 
[01:36:00]  things that i like but uh and which by the way i support i played tournament chess did you that's  right we thought we had this great conversation about because i never knew you were like oh my god  and we started talking about kasparov and all these matches magnus carlson has agreed to play me  how why do you play regularly i'm lying okay i just wanted to add something no i just play for  i remember i remember when i shot them when i shot the comedy special we went uh the after 
[01:36:30]  party was on this street and which i'd never been on before and we go down the street and there's all  these 24 hour chess the chess forum one of them just claw i'm guessing it's in the village and it  was like on thompson or something like that one of those streets yeah i was trying to figure out like  how do these places stay open you basically pay like five bucks an hour or something to sit down  and play but what keeps are they just been open for so long that do they own the buildings or  what's what do you think the deal is well one of them closed and i'm guessing online chess has  hurt a lot did you still go in there no i never played in those places i would always play at the 
[01:37:00]  cellar with keith or uh right those guys but uh i'm guessing it was just it's a community thing  but now with online chess you can stay home and play and smoke indoors yeah i forgot that you were a big  chess guy growing up yeah i love it you you were really good though i was very i was pretty good but  but i can't play anymore because it just it's too it hurts my head now you play chess with friends  no because i'm not uh i don't do i can't do it recreationally because i've so much of my  young life i was trained to like you know where you're basically trying to fry the board with 
[01:37:30]  laser eyes you know like it just did your instructor ever knock all the pieces off so you could see it  better no like in searching for bobby fisher no and throw the rook at your head like the rutgers coach  call you a faggot do you did you remember the old snl sketch with jim belushi where he was like  the bobby knight style chess coach yeah night to rock four what are you doing that's funny um so  anyway so i pitched the bbc show i'm a huge doctor who fan i got to know the bbc folks and they said 
[01:38:00]  do you want to do a show and i said yeah i want to do like a tv version of the podcast very cool so  it's like it's more it's not like if there aren't like cameras in a studio it's like a radio studio  it's it feels like a chat show right now is there an audience there yeah there's an audience that's  great though man i mean how long is it it's an hour it's an hour on the bbc so it's saturday night  so it's doctor who and then another show called orphan black that's a sci-fi show and then uh and  then our show the nerdist at 10 i got one uh just one chess uh question so we we all kind of grew up  playing chess but what was it that someone saw in you where they're like whoa you got you got a talent 
[01:38:30]  here and you we you should explore that it was me you just knew well it was me just loving the game  so much and my school um i just happened to be lucky enough to have a school that had the head of  the math department also was the computer lab and he was also the chess coach and so right in that  room if for and so he allowed he basically set the table for us to we'd play chess before school  during lunch and after school and then in between you'd screw around on the computers it was this 
[01:39:00]  bank of apple 2e computers and um you know so that that's where a lot of it that's where a lot of it  too i used to post the ratings on the wall every day they'd print out the ratings the the uscf ratings  and i uh i belong to a secret chess club and uh we were very secret society but we would greet each  other by seeing each other and going checkmate why don't you uh why don't you tell kate that when  she was in here because that's all i need is damp panties all over the studio oh chess boy 
[01:39:30]  you think she was interested at all she couldn't she literally couldn't if i picked a scab and held  it up to her she could would have been less interested to me well nothing to do with you  know if you had met under different circumstances but yes like like me with a ski mask and a gun  and her tied up somewhere i mean it's gotta it's gotta be it's gotta be really uh it's gotta be  really intimidating to come in to a room of dudes where everyone's talking real fast and there's a  lot of testosterone and excellent way to put it that's why i like chris because what you should 
[01:40:00]  have said is it must be really uncomfortable to come in where guys are talking and the one with gray  hair and the misshapen head hits on you  it's a really nice way to fucking phrase that thank you my friend of course i do enjoy chess though i  love love love fucking chess play like great chess players like uh you know i want to meet these  because they're playing i think uh magnus caustin is playing viswanathan anon like and i really am  interested in how that turns out for the championship and uh i'm just dying to to be at that match 
[01:40:30]  god you i'm telling you man it you you should do some type of a thing with it yeah but i'm not a good  enough player like i literally am a very average player but because i'm average at it like i i i  respect with the i'm fascinated by those guys like i would love to talk to any of them for a great length  and it would probably bore the audience i would just ask stupid questions i wonder if a lot of them  would really be good in conversation no they're probably good when talking to chess people who 
[01:41:00]  can talk about well explain your opening there well but me i'll just go so did you know when the  horse jumped the night were you happy that's the same piece asshole oh sorry but you know that you  know the game i really just talk about bobby fisher yeah yeah so did you agree with what he said  about jews go um i don't know why do you ask me these things yeah then they're winking yes yes  any americans get a chess i mean uh besides him yeah there's some i'm sure i mean there are many 
[01:41:30]  though is my point right they're russian russian because it's a culture of chess there yeah and  carlson is from like scandinavia or sweden or something uh or norway he's from some nordic  fucking country america like the other countries will take kids where they notice an aptitude for  something and make them you know like they will exploit those in terms of musicianship or sport you  know or like uh like like ballet or something like and or chess and in america it's basically like 
[01:42:00]  pageants you know like that pageants are what are america it's sort of what they do with their  sad yeah it really have uh the first black grandmaster i believe is uh american uh look  him up this i don't know his name but uh he say any name right now i think did you see uh brooklyn  castle that documentary last year i did not know but i remember that yeah it's very good it's about  uh a group of kids from a brooklyn chess team right right right i want to get them in to interview 
[01:42:30]  them actually uh well who's who's who's uh maurice ashley yes the first black gm you know something  about chess there just google it no i just like uh good documentaries and that was i love love a  good documentary brooklyn castle speaking of which uh vice is on tonight let's not forget get those  guys vice is on tonight shane smith's uh show love those guys from hbo vice on hbo it's gonna yeah  i haven't seen it yet but i know the show you're gonna be fun it's tremendous it's gonna be good he  saw the first uh two first two and they showed part of the korea episode which was oddly moving like 
[01:43:00]  because it wasn't all about rodman because there was a couple of the globetrotters there and they were  showing some of the game but then they're showing the globetrotters interact with these kids these  north korean children and uh it was really amazing to watch to watch these kids being uh just  spinning the basketball on their finger the globe that's the old trick they've never seen anything  like that like american kids see that shit on tv all the time they'd never seen it to watch them  reacting to it was really moving it was great wow these guys are fucking tremendous they were all  there too at the premiere shane was there fucking saru all of them the whole fucking and the one guy 
[01:43:30]  was telling us about getting drunk with kim jong-un it was very interesting and then then shane's  teasing that one line was it in afghanistan the border line oh no pakistan india pakistan yeah the  border the uh in cashmere he went right up to the line he was kind of fooling around with a little  bit it was great and basically if you go over the line they will shoot you they said that they will  if you walk into pakistan if you take one step over the line in pakistan they'll shoot you  and they mean it they're not saying nothing went right up to the line just kind of tiptoed around  this is not a cuba fucking u.s guantanamo thing where they're not actually going to shoot you if 
[01:44:00]  you took one foot over you know i mean if you ran in they might but if you put one foot over the  line in cuba they're not going to shoot an american but uh i'm in fucking in pakistan india you put  one foot over the line they'll they'll shoot you dead yeah i know i'm saying that like an authority  figure they're never gonna i'm repeating what i heard but with fervor and they're never gonna figure  that one out no they hate each other yeah it's hindus and muslims yeah they're not gonna figure that  one out oh you know what do i know yeah i just want another carlson anon anon match it's all i 
[01:44:30]  care about you looked it up when is it if i can get tickets tell roland to book them next so chris  when are you sleeping if you got all these projects i don't sleep very often i sleep on planes do you  really that's the like i can't sleep on planes at all i don't have a problem sleeping on planes  i even fall asleep while you're getting blown that's happened to me a few times  jesus really for real getting blown is that where yes oh a mouth bath yeah  oh what a great are you kidding though no i've been very tired i've been very tired 
[01:45:00]  you know jim you're you're fascinating to me because i think you should do a political show  or something you know it's because you like you know the girls come in and you sort of make like  i'm gonna i'm gonna put a ski mask on and you make these but you've you have so much insight into  things i really think you should do some kind of political something or i don't know thank you  nobody agrees with you i i agree with you but nobody agrees with you you're a fucking smart guy  you should really you could fucking take over wheeze says he likes talking politics with you 
[01:45:30]  one of my uber liberal friends you know i wheeze is a real liberal he's not a fake  language police all-in liberal yeah but he's a he's a guy really he's a liberal who just  did time in vietnam served two tours and fucking hates the government doesn't trust him  like that to me is what a fucking you know he's a he's a denim jacket wearing liberal he's not like  one of these guys who wants you fired if you don't hyphenate properly or but he always likes  talking politics with you well you know you give him a good you give him a good run and i'm well  i'm reasonable i don't disagree with him so well you know are you on the road a lot oh god is he i am 
[01:46:00]  but not as i just shot an hour so like i'm back now for a while i got a few dates i actually got  caroline's next week yeah um and then i get stretch factory a few things local you know baltimore and  then just i'm done with the act for a while it's like you want to just start over sure sure yeah that's  where i am i'm because my my special aired in november so now i'm building the new which is the best  it's fun it's a fun product i never the weird thing about this is i shot the special normally  once the special is shot i have no more fucking road work and it's goodbye material and right to 
[01:46:30]  the comedy cellar um but now i still have i'm gonna probably work up until july once the special airs i  will not be doing the material anymore you can't i found what's interesting is that when i did the first  when i did the the special last year it basically was born out of a bunch of shorter sets that were  stitched together but now that i'm forming the set on the road in as that when i go when i've gone  and like tried to do guest sets 10 minute guest sets i'm i fucking struggle because i'm like oh god i  don't know this one bit needs this other bit next to it to contextualize it and it's sort of hard to 
[01:47:00]  because i i'm not just like joke joke joke joke joke so it's been sort of weird but it's great like  to do the hour is great but it is hard when you walk into a place they want you to all right we'll do a  couple minutes so and it's like all right well my opening joke i can't do that because i fucking  say continent my next joke is racial i can't do that like they think that they just do a couple  of minutes because you have to you sort of have to let the audience get to know you a little bit  before you before you go deeper so that they're like okay they're already on board they know you're 
[01:47:30]  not threatening they know that you know so it's sort of uh if some guy in la was like oh i'm starting  up the show do you want to come do seven minutes and i felt like a dick i was like i don't know if i know  how to do seven minutes anymore because i don't have just like like eight jokes for seven minutes  said and you got a child i did live at gotham last night and chris didn't care it was only the  owner of gotham he was too older stuff whatever because i couldn't do anything i just shot if i  aired something live on tv before it out of my special they would have fucking decapitated me  yeah of course so um i'm going through a lot of material which was fun to do because i haven't 
[01:48:00]  done something in a while and something i've never done on tv and then there was one new bit that's  just not going to stay in the special that i did and uh it was weird to have to time it  because you know it's live television so the guys wrap up wrapping up and i'm and he's like  you better fucking finish quickly at one point i just look at the crowd i'm like ah look at these  girls all right be right back did you really yeah because i knew like i would rather just go out like  just saying something silly that's funny in the middle of a joke and when you fuck you can't fuck  with the advertisers right you know you just can't yeah we we don't fuck with the advertisers ever 
[01:48:30]  i think that's the beauty of not having any you know there's nothing to lose we risk losing no one  we can't offend our advertisers chris hardwick is at carolines this weekend and of course it's  nerdist on twitter it's the nerds podcast it's nerdist.com it's the bbc show it's unbelievable  yeah because chris is a fucking doer i respect that honestly i mean i really mean that it's  fucking good you you you do you do shit and that's respect i agree i think it was just like i said before  the majority of my career i wasn't doing anything and then i and then you get to a certain point you're 
[01:49:00]  like if i don't start doing stuff now it's not gonna happen right and they don't and no one just  let's just get comes in and goes here have this thing no they don't and it's we all wait for that  magic day where someday i'll wake up and the call will come jim everything's in line you just have  to show up the network's all called they get it just never gonna happen they just have to show up  they knew you were sleeping in that will never happen and the podcast is always uh in the top 10 if  not even i mean it's it's like one and one or two on a lot of weeks too there yeah we've been 
[01:49:30]  pretty fortunate about it's been it's just fun i just i just like doing the stuff that i do that's  i think that's the best thing is if you like what you're doing it's all everything's gravy do you do  it by yourself like bill burr do you have guests um well i have we have there are two co-hosts who are  on a lot of the episodes but not all of them because i some a lot of my travel or they're working or  whatever on other stuff and so but we we have guests and then we have episodes where it's just the  three hosts oh cool uh that we call hostful episodes and those usually go up about once a 
[01:50:00]  week good for you man and we just did a stand-up special too we did a stand-up special at our  space at meltdown where's meltdown meltdown's a comic book store in la and we have a little  theater space at the back so we do shows seven nights a week and so we did i did a stand-up we  do a stand-up special once a year so we're putting that up oh that's great man yeah see we need a  spot like that somewhere in new york city we need just our little joint you need a live spot to do  we talk about a lot of stuff all of us nothing we don't do it dude seriously i'm telling you  having a little clubhouse was so great for us and ours is in a comic book store and it's a really 
[01:50:30]  great environment and the store is huge and it's kind of a legendary store and a lot of our podcasts  we have a space upstairs and a lot of our podcasts record there it's really it's fun so yeah you guys  should just have a live space we won't come hang out you go do live shows and here's what we do we  complain on the air and complain to each other and we mean it we're genuinely being honest with each  other and then we just go our separate ways and all do nothing about i gotta tell you something  though but we're also under contract and these guys just don't feel like listening to it i've had  i've i gotta defend us a little bit i've had a shitload of meetings with scott greenstein on a lot 
[01:51:00]  of this stuff and it's a lot of yeah yeah yeah yeah and nothing ever fucking we don't make it happen  i say we because i'm as late i believe me i i am emotionally at times very bad with this shit i i  know what i have to do and i don't do it what's very hard and what i don't understand how you do is  doing a morning radio show is so emotionally taxing and exhausting i don't know how you do  get up super early in the morning and then still go perform at night because i find that if in both  fields you level off at mediocrity it removes all pressure i can wake up tired and be blah i can go 
[01:51:30]  on stage tired and it's blah that's all it is it's a constant mediocre i have a final question because  you just brought up something why is doing morning radio so taxing you did you you you've been in this  radio game i did now because we only worked four or five hours you do technically what is it is it  mentally just exhausting well for me i remember you know i remember getting up at like three o'clock in  the morning you'd get beat to work by 4 30 you'd have to do show prep so you know we were on the air 
[01:52:00]  at i don't know 5 30 maybe or six or something and then it you definitely do the four hour show but  you're constantly mentally engaged the whole time because you're looking at the clock how long okay we  got this we're talking to that guy we're moving this break go to the song then after that there's the  post-show then you kind of got a plan and then throughout the day you're like oh what are we  going to do for the show tomorrow then so it's really it's really like a 12 hour job right and  and your day ends at like three in the afternoon and then you're exhausted and then you have time  to do other stuff and then that i bailed on it being a 12 hour a day job it's not even a job for 
[01:52:30]  us but it was for many years but i finally had to like say no man mentally it's killing me it's it's  and people work way the fuck harder than us but i go home exhausted a lot i would challenge i would  i mean yes it's not you know this stuff it's it's it's not like uh uh uh you know construction or  building a railroad or like it's not work with your hands but you know you challenge someone to be  super focused and mentally engaged for like five hours straight and they're gonna be tired your brain  gets fucking tired right in the real world you're lucky to get someone to pay attention to you for 15 
[01:53:00]  seconds i mean you have to have that ridiculous focus for four or five hours a day yeah where you  really are paying attention to everything for five hours or else yeah it goes off the rails right on  well chris it's always a pleasure thanks hardwick good to see you double god motherfucker chip's guided  tour through the ona archives continues with more unforgettable ona appearances by the world's  top comics coming up this show got me in trouble of course it did this is a very chipperson

[01:56:30]  we know i think we hit a couple of hot topics on the news doing that's it veiled racist to  trashing veiled no exactly i hate how veiled racism sounds it's phony i like being authentic  i like saying the world veiled yes that is veiled yeah yeah no no of course i'm very happy for you  and uh how come no wednesday shows now we'll get to it jesus christ  is that like the theater day off or something no no i don't know it's actually not a bad question 
[01:57:00]  that's what's so annoying about it you're supposed to do matinees on wednesday that's the two show  day i'm not in the village i'm doing matinees on the weekend if you'd like to stop by oh okay oh  saturday and sunday yeah i mean it's convenient you're in the village you're out having a nice  afternoon with the family walking around doing a little shopping you're like oh let's catch a show  before we head back to the path train yeah yeah is that like that just takes up your whole life for  the entire length of uh when you do this doesn't it yeah it's all encompassing yes it is no time for 
[01:57:30]  yourself there's no me time you're right about you time i guess what i don't want it right now  anyway this weather we've been having oh let's talk about the weather what a great segue and i tell  you this was the april showers right yeah it's like god pissing on you right oh well i guess that's  one way to look at it fuck you just wanted to tell me about you and conan having a beef and it was  this fighting irish family oh yeah the uh the joyces and i wound up watching all these documentaries 
[01:58:00]  on these bare knuckle brawlers in ireland they're pretty fucking interesting man hilarious yeah yeah  all they do is fight over some slight irish well they know they're tinkers they're like gypsies  and you read the comments and it goes because it was like i meet you in longford now you never  showed up joe have it and they just keep arguing and then they beat the balls of each other really  but then the comments you can tell they're the most hated people in ireland because  underneath it's like they're useless cunts hitler was right about killing gypsies you should kill  every fucking one they do nothing they had nothing to society and it's like all these great comments 
[01:58:30]  just callum like irish written so well but just like a combination of cursing and like literate  just trash really everybody hates their guts so they hate each other and everybody hates them  everybody hates them why do they like why are they doing this no they've been doing that for  hundreds of years to settle inter-family beefs they have two guys you know the joyce mcquinn mcdonough  and there's all these different families and they just have these they have these big beeps and some  of them are really funny guys you know but you can barely understand them what is that about why 
[01:59:00]  they hate each other and a lot of them honestly a lot of them and i'm not just saying this to  to be inclusive to our uh they fill in for opie today but a lot of them do look like scorch  really yes do they yeah facially they've done facially come on there's just something about them  this one guy was talking about how he keeps his fucking hands hard he goes i soaked him in joe joyce  joe joy i soaked him in petrol for 20 minutes a day yeah he's soaked his hands in gas 
[01:59:30]  for 20 minutes a day it's not even gas petrol you know it's like eastern european knockoff shit  all right yeah very low octane very high in fucking additives oh you know that's a fight  his wife must have hated when his big fucking hard rock hands went into her pussy oh just burns her  pussy yeah they don't they don't finger each other in ireland they just have regular sex oh you think  regular missionary position to have kids yeah i remember a friend of mine was a little kid went to 
[02:00:00]  ireland and he was like 10 to visit his relatives and he came back and told us how he had to have  these fights with all these little kids from this trailer and he started describing tinkers but we  didn't know what it was you know what i mean oh shit so it's like one of those things that you  they're like hey yank come on yank and they made him fight every day and it was the same thing what a  vacation just kidding fucking the shit beat out of you that sounds horrible he was a wild kid anyway so  was he oh okay it does seem like if you go to ireland you're probably going to get in a fight  like those they like to mix it up if you're in the bar the whole time obviously something's going 
[02:00:30]  to happen like the donny brook i always see every footage of piece of footage ireland i see it's  fucking dismal out the weather is cloudy i have zero desire like today yeah here in our own oh yes  well i'm surprised that jim is like a sunny day enthusiast he's like i don't want to go to that  dismal weather yeah jim is he smiles when he sees sunshine he's a god i didn't realize he was a  fucking brazilian supermodel i get the doldrums from some of that weather what the fuck is this 
[02:01:00]  well i don't you know go out before it's dark do you no respectable comedian i just don't care for uh  i just don't care for overcast weather it really dampens my mood i don't blame you yeah people uh  they put those those fucking lights on themselves they look into a fucking light all winter long  because they don't they get seasonal depression i have so so they have to look into a light i think i think  our own troy kwan right there he has one yeah and it's so you your body and your eyes can see some  type of what would be sunlight i'm worried about all the other shit you're worried about this what 
[02:01:30]  about pesticides  i'll pour water on my strawberries pour his water all over your strawberries only because i knew if i  reached for your coffee which i wanted to do and smashed it you would have caught me too early  yes i had to go with what was available to my hands now jim's moving his he's moving his items  away from me well i told you this creep started it many years ago i was trying to have a lovely cup  of tea at the comedy cellar as i like to have and suddenly i go upstairs and i was like oh they gave 
[02:02:00]  me mint tea instead of regular tea you know i fucking i don't like mint tea turns to turns out to be  they gave me regular tea it was not the staff swald i want to emphasize that oh this asshole  was chewing gum and stuck his gum in my fucking tea  i was drinking his goddamn gum his gum juice  holy shit you thought it was mint tea i was like oh mint tea i don't like this mint tea he's 
[02:02:30]  smirking at the table so ever since then anytime he's at the table i got you twice yeah and that  was 10 years ago yeah and ever since then literally if he's at the table even all these  years later you think somebody's a mature adult i carry my tea any drinking any beverage i have i  carry him down well you should yes he's gonna fucking pervert it in some fashion wow  were you grossed out with the thought you know no just one of those things it was just infuriating  it's in his mouth and you know no anthony you know what it is you just you like certain comforts 
[02:03:00]  that's all i'm saying that's all you're saying what can we look forward to in uh your unconstitutional  well you're the only one that really understands what i'm trying to achieve i love it oh i know  what you're trying to achieve no you don't maybe you meant me what's that maybe you meant that i'm  the only one who understands no i meant anthony's the only worse what do you think you're trying to  achieve let's take let's do a test what is he trying to achieve trying to achieve he is trying to  rid the world of this ignorance and revisionist history that is going on and using humor to get 
[02:03:30]  these points across instead of the doldrums of c-span thanks of course what do you think jim's very  trying to do some fucking fun jokes oh that's i told you about that idiot voice that time back in  the early 90s i know i've said this before i'll say it again until the whole country understands voice  just hated me because all these guys knew i was funny and voice didn't get and he would get so  one time i was on stage at carolines and i did something but it was like almost like i go this 
[02:04:00]  is like a poem but it was like a comedy but it wasn't a poem you know it was jokes yeah but it didn't  work he comes up right after me it's 1994 goes i i don't we didn't know each other barely just a  little bit hey i don't do poems i do fucking jokes folks oh oh shit just sold me out did you  fucking hate him right then and there i was like who is this god this asshole fucking mullet  bastard no rat tail he had a rat tail yeah rat tail well rat tails were big in 94 yeah well maybe 
[02:04:30]  not big but they were what the fuck why would he say that son of a bitch especially not knowing you  yeah i mean he knew me a little bit but you know not that not that well just because he was feeling  his oats he was in carolines you know it was like it was like voice is the one that broke it  open in many ways for norton and the rest of the jersey hacks to actually work in new york  jersey hacks in that stance yeah you know what i mean yeah bring in the jersey hacks  yeah i think voss got there first we went around the same time though yeah now i remembered very 
[02:05:00]  vividly it was voss lewis loved voss he did voss probably got you in but i used to go to the comic  strip and me you franchisee florentine and eric mcmahon would go out right um to eat at that place  across the street from the strip so that's fucking like 1995 jeez million years ago right  million years ago guys you used to call me naughty norton oh hello naughty yeah that was you in fact you  were naughty i was a naughty boy i was a naughty boy yeah and you lived with uh jim at the time 
[02:05:30]  i think that's before i lived with jim i spoke to battling bob lee i i'm walking on 46 here's  here's the problem with the world i'm walking on 46th street yesterday going to a important  publicity lunch at joe allen top trendy restaurant with the ap and i passed this theater on 46th  street you know there's a bunch of shows over there like and i look and it says appearing only  tonight in one of the theater shows bob the reverend bob levy wow so i took a picture and sent it out 
[02:06:00]  so the public knew what was going on on the broadway for one night on the great white way  bob levy he's like a broadway name now yeah right wow for one night only uh call i gotta ask you um  what do you what's your take on uh the constitution in this day and age a lot of people saying uh it's  being trotted upon well that's that's i really i honestly i i feel like uh i feel like we should be  having more constitutional conventions so that people can really discuss this kind of thing i feel 
[02:06:30]  like it's not a serious discussion it's when it's just everybody putting their everybody's just  saying this this this picking and choosing everyone's like yes you need to have a serious  conversation and they're like well let's face it the only thing you care about is the gut is the  second well i kind of like the first too no you care about the second i like the second but why do  you care about the first well that's what i do it's kind of my job who's trotting on the first  amendment uh there are a lot of things uh that uh trot on my first amendment rights especially 
[02:07:00]  um political correctness more so than oh infuriating to to do not have the ability i will  absolutely to not have the ability to address especially racial issues in this country without  having the scarlet r put on your chest is a fucking embarrassment i'm tired of black people being  called racist for addressing white issues i agree with you oh unbelievable it really is infuriating i  would really like to have more of a uh freedom yeah to say things and have an open dialogue because  nothing gets accomplished unless you can really hash it out like that but they're so afraid to just 
[02:07:30]  have an open discussion about race in this country well let's actually address very deeply in the show  good i gotta see it's almost like you're quoting the show in many ways wow do you address the fact  with the uh i was actually going to use scarlet r i have it written down but now i'm afraid because  are you're not call because i feel like i the scarlet letter don't even feel instead of an a it's an  r don't even feel that way you take it yeah hester trinn oh somebody's uh doing a little weeding on 
[02:08:00]  the old stem master now do you mention the fact that in the constitution yeah everybody complains like  like uh when you mentioned the guns right and you say something about well that you know when the  constitution was drafted they didn't have fucking ar-15s or whatever it is they have it was a  different time well i certainly don't want to mention that because that would be you know and  they say well different time they still meant the same thing but if you say how can you listen to  people who wrote the constitution because they had slaves they're talking about freedom these same 
[02:08:30]  people go that was a different time you have to allow that yeah that's a good point i uh i see it as  there are certain things that um you have to look at um when when they were when they were keeping  rights from people that is what is considered wrong when they're when they're uh respecting rights because  rights aren't given they're just they're there they're your god-given rights and when they're  respecting those rights that's a good thing so with the second amendment uh they're respecting your 
[02:09:00]  right to bear arms as of being slave owners they are uh taking away someone's rights so you can make  that distinction jim they're not the same thing that you're really talking about but it's the  overall point and the view of how we say that was the times well so we throw the entire document  away because they were slave owners is that uh is that smart immediate strawberry he's got a very  constitutional mustache made out of a napkin call you're looking very very very come on very 
[02:09:30]  constitutional the constitution yeah but that's this little argument this little whatever  this was here is exactly why the show now it's more important now than than ever if you see  one show now i only mean five weeks right because despite jim's plans for me to tour all over the  goddamn country right he has you everywhere i'm sick of this thing i've been doing in a year right  five weeks and i want to fucking shoot it make some goddamn money get the fuck out well i want to go  see it and uh you know i have to i have to make one more comment about that because a lot of people do 
[02:10:00]  bring up the well it was muskets back then they would never you know have it with assault rifles  and whatnot do you think when they wrote the second amendment and uh said you have the right to bear  arms that they weren't talking about the absolute top of the line weaponry of their day the musket  they didn't say well you have the right to bear this it's not as good as our amazing assault musket  but so as time went on you got better weaponry and during the course of their own lives they saw 
[02:10:30]  weaponry advance uh uh leaps and bounds you didn't you thought they thought it was just going to stop  right there they knew it was going to advance i i firstly i don't think they saw the degeneration  the way society would degenerate at the school shootings i don't believe they saw that coming  they've seen all over the globe but regardless of what they thought at that point this is where we are  now right and we have to look at things and how they're affecting us now and the point i'm making  is simply people are and this is all of us are selective when they look at something like well 
[02:11:00]  that was the time like we say that at certain times when it suits the argument but to say that  that was the times when they wrote about muskets it's like well they meant it to continue well then  given given that that's what the times was so we can move along well that anyway that's all he wants  that really is all i want is that all he wants you to do is go hey you know what that's an  interesting point and we can fucking move along what an interesting point and i i i gotta agree  this is not about this is about states rights versus federal rights thank you yes that's what i'm 
[02:11:30]  trying to say yes and the show covers it don't worry about okay good i'm sitting here going guys just  come to see the show then you can really make yes yes and you'll be informed oh you'll be totally  informed yeah i i don't like new york states rights i don't like what they've done with the  second amendment as far as that goes but well overstepped their bounds but it is their stupid  right it's their right well well it's the people they're right the state's rights are limited by  the constitution right so i think they're overstepping their boundaries in some respects 
[02:12:00]  as far as the second amendment goes i really do second you mean uh and bloomberg yeah and i think  also that they're uh they're putting legislation in place that does nothing that whole that when they  said when cuomo wrote into law that uh you have to have a magazine with seven rounds capacity seven  rounds seven bullets didn't he do enough research to know that they don't make seven round mags for  uh ar-15s and for a lot of handguns and stuff that there's only a five and then a 10 round magazine 
[02:12:30]  so then they're like okay we we fucked that up we didn't even know about magazines when we wrote a  law of fucking law about what's that more unforgettable appearances from the biggest names in comedy  coming up this big world this big round globe is theater in the round to me i'm just here for the  show a very chippers in thanksgiving will continue on the opian anthony channel  now more legendary ona appearances from our favorite stand-up comics a very chippers in thanksgiving

[02:15:30]  i might know a thing or two about uh some crazies but you want to hear that thing no man i was  excited he wasn't even here i read the whole book because you know i i probably could relate to a few  of those things thanks i had a mother thing too have you taken a couple of wrong roads my friend  is that what it was a couple of wrong roads one party too many the only question i have about the  book even though it's uh why weren't there more stories about your mom in the book you kind of like 
[02:16:00]  hinted towards i got hit by a car i was in a car accident and harper college wanted  to finish the book and there were like 100 pages of notes is that really was that really it that's  absolutely it they were like no we have a deadline we want to be for the christmas holidays i'm like  i'm laid up i got hit head on by a car in long island i mean i was at a passenger in a car right  yeah car coming toward us hit his head on at about 65 i think the newspaper said holy shit so i i wasn't  able to finish it so they just wrapped it up oh my god you guys never got this damn yeah because the book 
[02:16:30]  still is really good but i got i got kind of mad i'm like i know he's got a few tons of dialogue  about my mom okay right tons of stuff about her but then i'm thinking you were holding it back for  a second book going if the first one goes good i'm gonna give you some shit no i know some good  shit for the second no it was i've all scribbled down on a piece on what kind of notes did they give  you because i i my book was different so it wasn't like it is biographical biographical is yours  what were they saying like fix this story or don't tell this one or um well first of all i i wrote 
[02:17:00]  probably i don't know how the book is 250 pages or something i wrote probably 800 they brought in  this young lady a young writer a beautiful writer named liz stein who and she like turned it into a  book you know 280 pages yeah they have to edit certain stories and a consistency and stuff like  that but so why don't we just say uh you were on snl okay now we'll move on just wait a minute  hold the phone yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean they i just would hand the stuff in and then i was in 
[02:17:30]  the accident and uh i wasn't really able to do anything for a couple of months so they were really  that laid up huh what were your injuries um most brutist internal organs cracked ribs dislocated stuff  uh meat uh her disc uh wow damn they cut you out of the car no they didn't cut me out of the car i  let my i let myself out of the car you did yes i did i because i thought it was going to explode 
[02:18:00]  oh well yeah you don't want to be part of that yeah i thought that i was like well in the movies  the car always that's true i kind of think that could happen you don't like that so i know i did manage  to get out yeah and it's so interesting because it hurt then and i remember lying on the pavement going  i i guess you could die from the wow yeah hurting this bad that wasn't half of what it became in two  weeks when my organs started to swell you know like my all my organs started getting large and it 
[02:18:30]  looked like i had a rope underneath my skin wow holy gee it's two weeks for that to happen  i would say two weeks to a month before i really oh wow i mean i look at i was on oxycod and i might  have the time off the guy's like i'm going to give you oxycodone i'm like really all right  an excuse yeah i mean that's the terrible thing about having that much pain though it just 
[02:19:00]  kind of takes it away you don't like it high it just does what it's supposed to do it yeah it makes  it so that you can go to the bathroom a little bit for a while so what you lose you guys are  stopped at a stoplight and the car was coming down there no we were actually turning uh we were  a lane turning left and um the car was coming towards us and um the person driving me turned  into the oncoming car oh and that's like hello to your side right there yeah and i got hit it hit 
[02:19:30]  the right corner yeah yeah that was you a belt on i had a seat belt on but it was the the airbag  that saved me but also caused the injuries but it kept me yeah without that airbag you did splattered  oh wow splattered all over the pavement the windshield yeah it's fucking horrifying and you  remember it like did you did you see i almost had an accident once and it's weird how it unfolded  in slow motion did you see it or just all of a sudden you felt it i was reading my script  because i was in a play on long island i was going to the show and the driver screamed 
[02:20:00]  oh my god like that and i was like really what oh wow and then it was glass and steel yeah oh  that's terrible do you hang out with that i also said oh my god really you know you think you're  gonna say something really cool right at death's door yeah you're gonna have something to say like  damn the torpedoes full speed ahead you don't oh my god oh my god 
[02:20:30]  yeah do you hang out with that person anymore i do okay you aren't mad huh you aren't mad at them  i was for a long time okay i would assume it was a mistake big big bug mistake big mistake  big mistake yeah so now they're gonna make uh the book into a documentary kind of um  kind of like that yeah sort of yeah i mean i was on i got discovered so to speak at caroline so i  guess that's the angle is it just your stand-up are they talking to you off stage and just kind of 
[02:21:00]  intersplicing they'll film stand-up and off stage and then there's a couple guys in the book eddie the  cop that um was so prominent in the second half of the book is coming and gonna be pretty cool  are you doing a uh there's always a paperback edition uh has that come out yet i had a paperback but  hurricane sandy came and all 12 interviews got canceled and it's really hard to get charlie  rose back wow you really uh charlie rose like i was supposed to make my money on the paperback 
[02:21:30]  yeah i didn't make nothing on the hard copy but i had a nice deal that if it ever made it the  paperback i'd make a couple of bucks hurricane sandy came all 12 interviews canceled oh my gosh  someone didn't want this luck out well look what was the original title if there's a god up there i'm  fucked yeah no god if you're not up there i'm fucked but it's interesting to me because i i was  raising money for uh special needs kids in monroe louisiana which i mean they paid me a nominal fee  and don't get me wrong but i i was doing that so they said you know maybe he should do a book signing 
[02:22:00]  now remember god and fuck in the same title yeah as blasphemes one of the commandments we're in the  bible belt i signed no copies of my book in four hours i signed almost 50 copies of 50  shades of gray wait absolutely a true story you were sitting in this book signing no one wanted  to sign my no one wanted my smut and on their coffee table you didn't do no one show up for the  signing they were there but they were there for 50 shades of gray they didn't want my book and they 
[02:22:30]  and they wanted me to sign 50 shades of gray which is really strange sitting there when no one i've had  a few slow signings too where you start talking to the person you sign a long autographed hey frank  thanks for coming you know you really like the detail yeah it's looking at me we've had a few  yeah it was kind of silly and i i had i had tried to say you know it's in the united states in a judeo  christian society you you can make fun of a member of the flock but not the flock into the flock the 
[02:23:00]  ten commandments is the flock yeah and you can't do that and so that was blasphemed on the cover  i mean you know i couldn't get into target with my book i couldn't get into the airports i couldn't  get into uh oh uh walmart which is kind of if you're selling a heart did anybody tell you like  hey maybe you should no no no change the title because you would have changed the title of course  i didn't want that stupid title oh my god so it hurts you and there wasn't even something you  needed i care less about that damn title i was jail in the caribbean and i couldn't think of 
[02:23:30]  nothing i i wanted to pray i was so scared i was like maybe praying maybe that sort of stuff works  and i was like maybe there's a god and i'm hoping there's a god and that caribbean story was frightening  you know and i was like i guess if there's not a god i'm i'm in a lot of trouble in a manner of  speaking i'm fucked that's a good title and then i put that in the transcript like there's your title  i'm like really because i know in stand-up if you offend moses or any of the leaders of the 
[02:24:00]  movement that your show's over um that doesn't pertain to books oh wow yeah whatever who came up  with the title is it someone in the company yeah i guess so yeah it's weird the stuff that they  should have known better especially if they wanted to get you in the airports and all these other  places well they didn't want to they i think they wanted to sell it online and became a bestseller  online did it really yeah yeah it did but that's because of dr phil actually oh you did do something 
[02:24:30]  with dr phil right yeah i mean he he plugged it so hard it became a bestseller you know because i owe  it i mean it would not have been anything without him so i always disliked dr phil but i guess if he  takes care of you and if he did the right thing by um yeah i don't know him that well i i think he's  very colorful and interesting but i mean he liked the book and he had me on and all of a sudden it's  all it takes not that i made any money um did they did they say to you too much mother stuff like  did they was that one of the notes they gave you like no no they wanted more mothers that's the 
[02:25:00]  reason that and the reason for the book was my mom okay that was the interesting thing uh and also  saturday night live so yeah uh it's just they had a deadline and they have thankfully you have this  brilliant young writer named liz stone who's like i can imitate your writing and and she did she like  finished it yeah wow so you had stroke of bad luck and good luck the fact that what's finished was  lucky because you could have been killed but the fact the bad luck was the timing at the end and 
[02:25:30]  and the fucking paperback that stuff happens right oh yeah it stinks though fucking the paperback is  worse so the fact that you didn't oh hurricane sandy yeah so it was released but it just people no one  knew it was out right right couldn't you do a second push a few weeks later i mean i know it's not the  same um you can't get charlie rose again oh i mean really aaron burnett now cnn no yeah i mean no  they they're already too late they've moved on yeah yeah um i mean i know that burns and noble had the 
[02:26:00]  they were i was very happy they put me in noteworthy non-fiction but nobody paid any attention to it  was it the same title no we we renamed it god uh if you're not up there dot dot dot which for the  people like what the hell is that i mean what the hell is that yeah that is a little vague yeah  did you add any material to it huh was there any new material in the paperback um no they didn't  want any they're like please really work you gotta be out of your mind oh my god yeah there was some 
[02:26:30]  stories that need because that's a selling point for a paperback is when there's a little additional  there was a hundred pages right of handwritten notes but stuff that will make it into i mean if  if it's ever like i've been to meeting you know you probably go to meetings where they talk about  adapting it for other media right yeah you go to those right yeah wink wink  yeah sure pal yeah yeah so now uh you could always put that in a documentary though i mean 
[02:27:00]  you're doing a documentary that would be an interesting the documentary wouldn't be just  telling the exact same stories in the book you'll have some extra stories which will tell the chair  story i mean uh how this great doctor uh had me work use these two chairs to find out what was  inside my head and why i was cutting myself yeah that's an interesting yeah it should have been in  the book but it ain't did it work was it accurate well why was i doing something and i didn't really  know why i was doing it and why was i doing it for years i didn't know why i had these things locked 
[02:27:30]  up in my head and he used these two chairs good angel bad angel he had me play my mom oh man you  you would sit in one chair and be your mom and the other chair be yourself yes and would you move  back and forth yes yes yes and uh you move from chair to chair yeah did it feel silly at first and then  all of a sudden resonate it broke like within 30 seconds it broke yeah it worked like he goes sit  in the chair and now say this um um mom i don't um you know i have a lot of problems you never answer 
[02:28:00]  for this now go over here and play your mom answer for what answer for the fact that look i don't know  anything about that blood oh shit like you're like wow and then you're like you know everything about it  you were there yeah wow yeah the guy's like a genius that is like just to conjure up the image  of that actually happening is frightening yeah but they're but i mean great doctors can do stuff like  that you know the thing about these great trauma doctors is that they can get up in your head and not 
[02:28:30]  make it worse you know like find out what's going on in there why do you keep doing this stuff  yeah you know and and not hurt you actually injury like they unlock the door and let it seep out  without letting it fucking just wreck the rest of what's in there absolutely like lancing a wound or  something like that but they're not that many of them i mean trauma therapy is still sort of in its  infancy but there are a couple i mean this this guy had me i was locked up upstate for three months 
[02:29:00]  i mean he didn't like do it the first day right you know how do you know when something like that's  happening though that you're not and uh i mean maybe it makes you how do you know that you're  not creating something in that moment um as opposed to bringing back something that really happens like  what what in your mind tells you no this is actually genuine i think when you snot starts coming out of  your nose and you uh start bawling and sputtering and and yeah is it like oh my god i forgot like can you  do you have things where you're like i can't believe i forgot that yes absolutely because i thought you 
[02:29:30]  know i had the world's best mom that's what they call her world's best mom sang in the choir quoted  verses uh a counselor a spiritual advisor to the community and then when uh people's backs were turned  she was doing crimes against nature jesus but that's what predators do i mean they create a front  you know like oh look at that i mean i'm like all the great predators had a great front and it's 
[02:30:00]  usually church or civic groups or national pride or something like that what was her motivation for  being uh so i guess cruel she was abused too okay hideously yeah yeah she yeah wow some people are  able to like turn that around aren't they like like make it like okay i was abused so i will never abuse  well you know it's a difference in degree um uh difference in degree but in essence it's the 
[02:30:30]  same thing i mean you can push a person into you know like some like me i become a cutter and a drinker  and i'm a you know a ne'er-do-well and then someone gets pushed farther than i got pushed you know  they become like a bona fide sociopath oh geez yeah do you ever think you had the potential of  going over the line i think we all do and just becoming a serial killer that bad we could all i  believe if you give us don't you think of course you give us the right circumstances we could all 
[02:31:00]  be something that we'd be ashamed of listening to daryl's voice right now show i'd like to be  something i'm not but just listening to you it's like and with your dallas wearing sunglasses and very  relaxed and calm and it's like i could picture this as a prison interview by somebody who had done  horrific things like it's the same like you know well this is what happens it's just all calm right  yeah yeah yeah i mean you know my dad uh was a great he was a soldier and he you know being all 
[02:31:30]  that stuff people can see in combat he had post-traumatic stress that ain't the same thing as what my mom  was you know what i'm saying and uh near the end of his life he was all confused he had cancer and i  brought this cop down from new york this great dude this great cop i knew still a pal am i and he had to  sit down with my dad in the last month of his life and explain to him because my dad was confused  first of all he's on fentanyl which is stronger than morphine he's got a month or two to live he's 
[02:32:00]  confused and being eaten up by cancer so i brought this pal down and i remember they were out in the  yard and uh my father goes i wonder if i can have me a drink he's got a month to live my friend's like  have a drink max have a drink friend let me make you a drink they make him a drink  i've watched them out in the yard and they're having martinis and you know this guy's gesturing  like and i opened the the the door once and i heard him say because max they made furniture out of 
[02:32:30]  people they made chairs because it's not like a korean guy fighting for his country or a french  guy fighting for his country or anyone these guys made chairs out of people max they had to go  you understand god loves you for doing that wow yeah oh he's probably feeling some guilt over some  stuff and i think it's you know probably didn't take every prisoner that he might have i mean really 
[02:33:00]  after you see like what these guys do like maybe yeah you get war you're like maybe i don't want to  take and then i guess when you start getting to that point in life where you're you're gonna see in  the end of the road there you start thinking uh-oh was i right to do that maybe right yeah put that  guy on trial instead of shooting them you know yeah right right but but they were you know it's really  sad but they were bad guys they had to go they had to go they made furniture out of these yeah max they 
[02:33:30]  made furniture out of people that's something to hear when you fling the door open yeah he's like  there's a lot of types of cruelty in this world max i mean you understand i mean like an unintentional  cruelty you say something to your daughter your son you go back and you apologize you make it better  but then there's a kind of cruelty on fun uh on purpose and for fun max you understand on purpose  and for fun you understand intentional you know what i'm saying these guys made chairs  they made linen out of people and kids you understand you know like that wow man kill 
[02:34:00]  these son of a bitch straight shooter that's all shoot him that's all you can't talk to these son  of a bitches did you have any resentment against your dad for not stepping in yes for a long time  god you're talking my fucking story and we gotta go get coffee down and then you know because you  wonder why i gotta jump in you what the all this craziness is going on in the house and you wonder  why like yo pops get off the couch and figure this shit out you're you're the one that with the normal 
[02:34:30]  brain here yeah what what do you think that was about because uh i know in my own life i have  um let my pain my anger get in the way of doing what i knew to be right because i was too  absorbed too concerned with my own pain and my own rage right and uh i regret it deeply  he did at the end of his life and was able to say so to me and uh that was intense man and good and 
[02:35:00]  real good yeah i'm sorry i guess i i wasn't i was just a soldier hmm wow sometimes it's just easier i was  like yeah i know my dad i get it now i get it you know they played taps at the funeral i was very proud  wow shit i know my dad didn't pipe up because it was easier because all hell would would go toward  him yeah it's not that easy friend i mean no man i'm one of seven kids so i'm i'm sure my dad's  thinking well fuck if i act up here and try to do the right thing i might be stuck raising the seven 
[02:35:30]  kids alone here yeah they got their own shit they gotta worry about yeah life happens on you and  sometimes you're not wired i mean i know i wasn't wired to do what i wanted to do in the world  and um i had a lot to learn and i still do wow you know what i'm saying but now here's all  sharpton you know when i was a kid i grew up in brooklyn i would come home from school my mother would  make blueberry pie i mean you know i gotta pull out a voice once in a while just in case 
[02:36:00]  i was about to write a hang and i brought i have actual nooses in my bag anybody want to hang  themselves because i brought nooses we've been making fun of that blueberry pie and like what  were they thinking to allow that on tv he looks like a fucking clown i would sneak something with the  pie my mother said you sneak pies i know i didn't sneak pie i would have blueberry all over my face 
[02:36:30]  yeah weird little talent that's great was it rough to be uh to be funny i mean when you're well when  you're i think on snl and through your through your life doing stand-up and stuff with with all  that going on in your life was it a way to cut it off and not think about it yes yeah yeah every  an escape is addictive too yeah i think you know what that's like when you're like the first time  you walk out in front of 200 people that you never met before and you make them laugh hard 
[02:37:00]  you're like that you can get hooked on that yeah it's like being a small hitler like you're just  controlling a room full of people yeah i understand what being powerful and they're like you're like  they yeah i know you never met them before and they're laughing at stuff that you thought of  yeah it's pretty cool yeah can i ask you an impression question yeah which was uh the hardest one  that you had to learn that you just couldn't get it first uh i think that you know there was a big  disagreement on how to play bush when they wanted me to play bush and i i didn't have the same opinion 
[02:37:30]  um that that other people did at the time of him you know and i i didn't think of him as  unintelligent i know there were verbal gaps and he made mistakes but i didn't i thought of him as a smart  guy in an extraordinary circumstance um and he did make mistakes but i mean you know he's not a  natural actor that guy right you know some guys just are not good for that presidential stuff i  mean you you know what i mean like yeah he's not a natural actor you know it's at presidential 
[02:38:00]  that pomp and circumstance stuff that's not easy yeah clinton was good at clinton mick reagan was  yeah reagan i don't think anyone has ever been better at the spoken word than reagan or clinton  yeah martin luther king um i'm you know but he wasn't a politician but in terms of politics  i mean clinton gave that last convention speech using verify easily verifiable facts and figures  really heavy lifting if you're you know for usually because when you're rallying the troops it's 
[02:38:30]  it's like you have some slogan and pre-arranged thing and there are drinks and people cheer this guy  walks out with easily verifiable facts and figures and rocked i mean that was like a whole new that's  i mean to me that was like you know reminded me like the first time i saw michael jordan play  basketball i'm like wait that's the standard now now you got to do that if you want to compete i mean  that's how good you got to be and you know that and reagan was masterful i mean when reagan said 
[02:39:00]  mr gorbachev turn tear down that wall he combined sunday school teacher and f-16 fighter jack  really really heavy lifting i mean he wasn't kidding you look in that guy's eyes and see if  he's kidding with you right you know he was not right yeah yeah he's a serious dude and part of being  the president i mean i guess is city hall you got to go out there and talk to the troops yeah you know 
[02:39:30]  you got to give them speeches you got to talk about why we love this country and all that stuff  it's not easy it's very very very hard you know and i always felt like weird like these guys trying  to do this job and you're out there banging on i mean just making fun of them yeah i think i mean  you know wow i mean if you can imagine look at a presidential daily briefing in the morning  really this is what i got to do today really i mean really i mean how many terrorist threats last  night three thousand and what bank close and what country's going uh-huh because to me if my easy 
[02:40:00]  pass doesn't work i'm at the jumping off place you understand coming in from jersey my easy pass  doesn't work and i'm just gonna kick that car and go right into the river you know so you got to give  them credit some of that stuff's real hard so they wanted you to play it dumb and you felt that you  could caricature him without making him a complete moron i didn't want to play him like that at all  i wanted to play him whatever he was i wanted to discover it on my own but will ferrell had made 
[02:40:30]  such a hit playing him that way you know i oh right i knew he was something else and i wanted to get  into that well you met him i mean uh i know you performed for him and and did you get to talk to  him at all a little a little bit you know i got a little bit i talked to cheney more than him but  yeah how was he pushing yeah funny charming i mean he can do that man they're just amazing as 
[02:41:00]  far as being like charming yeah oh he was good but i don't again i want to say i don't believe  he was acting he was just like being this regular dude who you know might do a towel snap in the  locker room once in a while kind of a guy i mean i i did not think him unintelligent one bit  did you give him a baseball glove or something though so you i did i gave him a glove yeah for  what was what was the purpose i wanted to play catch with him i i had i want i was like you know 
[02:41:30]  so what he loves baseball what the hell i know he loves but i know he loves baseball and i know i  love baseball you're the president i don't have any money or nothing to give you but you and me like  baseball here's a glove so i had someone go down to the mall and it's awesome i actually went i went  down to the mall to the best sporting goods store in dc and i was like i want the best  rawlings baseball mitt you have i mean the very finest and i know a good mitt when i see one  that gives me this beautiful field of love and so i go to the back with the white house and of course 
[02:42:00]  the secret service cluster like the hell are you doing and i guess sir it's a glove please take a look  at it so they looked at it and they went all right give it to the president yeah you can offer him a  glove so i did i was like yo man i don't have nothing to give you but i know you like baseball  so here's a glove sir and mr president of course it was pretty cool and he he enjoyed it and saw the 
[02:42:30]  there's a picture i think in in some and a couple different books of him holding the glove up yes he  enjoyed it did you meet senior at all i met him briefly at the wall of astoria um just briefly  for a couple of minutes i got to speak with him uh that was pretty cool vic uh henley tells a story  about him and he says that when you meet him because you know he has such a bad reputation as  being a wimp and all this stuff but i mean remember that reputation he had as reagan's vp i do yeah but  he was head of the cia and vic said you feel like you're meeting a fighter pilot um oh yeah wimp 
[02:43:00]  really um uh desert storm really yeah no and world war ii yeah he's a fucking veteran and a pilot but  that was the reputation he had as reagan's vp well yeah because you know he talked like that and he  didn't you know we're not gonna do it and all that but there's an again a guy that if you see him uh out  of the presidential spotlight you're gonna see a different guy uh this a relaxed serious dude but  when they prop you up and go hold your head here hold your hands here say these words wait the 
[02:43:30]  camera's not on the lights that you know if you're not an actor yeah uh and and both of those that was  the thing i always liked about the the father and the kid was like pretty you know it's not you're  gonna find out what they're thinking there's a picture of you in bush that's a great shot see  that's a great picture yeah and obviously with clinton all holding the glove at the same time would  you like a picture like that jimmy he's met three presidents yeah yeah do you have pictures of all of  them uh i don't um my i do i don't have any with bush senior no no what's obama like crisp pleasant 
[02:44:00]  spent five minutes uh talking to my daughter um but very business like yeah yeah huh was he looser  bush seems like a funnier guy to me like he seems more of a regular that's why he fucked up more he  seems like more of a funny dude when i performed for him in the troops he came up to me afterwards and  he uh he like gave me like a bear hug which was kind of cool and he pats me on the belly he goes

[02:49:00]  monologue i did not notice it but i was very proud of that because that guy is hard why'd they  ask you to do it uh for whatever reason he couldn't make the show oh okay yeah but but from  what a lot of people are like no that was him that was like you you fucking nailed it it was pretty  close i listened to it this morning i thought it was pretty close to introduce kevin um is there  anyone yeah i guess i guess i helped it helped hearing him for that many years yeah we're just 
[02:49:30]  14 years you got to hear i was around him all the time yeah did you ever do it uh to him uh at  no i mean i one time um he had laryngitis once yeah that'll be it if you get a quick  fast forward to the end of the cold open  uh one of the philadelphia yeah so are you see it is a pretty good obama guy back up sam please you  fire back up back up back up here we go here we go so godspeed america and live from new york 
[02:50:00]  it's saturday it's saturday night live  with fred armison  vanessa payor  bill hater  we got the trill in his voice 
[02:50:30]  i couldn't believe i was doing that that was flipping me out  i want all that  i thought i was gonna mess up when he said musical guest that's what i was afraid of oh really  you know a lot of people  it's a long list 
[02:51:00]  featuring  here comes the music guys that's what i knew i was gonna screw up  that's good  now i'm getting nervous  you poured it on there 
[02:51:30]  i didn't notice that when i first saw it i mean now that i know i'm like oh okay  but it's fucking damn close man i did not notice that watching it  that's fairly close yeah i was proud of that one  yeah is that all he does there is just the announcement  um uh yeah 
[02:52:00]  yeah yeah  has he been doing it since the very beginning  yeah oh yeah he's been there  how old is he now  don't know  he's gotta be well into his 80s  he's uh the voice of snl  i mean what a fucking  that's a cool gig  that's from the beginning he said  chevy chase  that's crazy  richard fryer  yeah i mean it's so weird like you  watching him do like vocal warm-ups at snl  oh yeah 
[02:52:30]  like one day he had gotten off the elevator and there was a sign  um uh beside the elevator  and uh he's standing he was like he would walk around and read labels from things while he was warming up  he's like sexual harassment seminar  and he really talks like that right  really  that's his voice  his coffee really blows  it's no  you know  holy  quite a set of pipes 
[02:53:00]  yeah huh  very recognizable voice  that's why it's really hard  fucking warm-up too  that's interesting  yeah  what color would he say when you saw the impression  orange  yeah  what's the color thing about it again  just sees it in colors  i don't understand it  but i've thought of it many times since  it's such an interesting way that the bread works  yeah yeah  who knows  it's just a little game i play with myself  to kind of lock in  that's all  anyone you're working on  trying to perfect that you  yeah  no  i like doing l sharp  yeah that was off  i like doing  i told you the new orleans cop story last time 
[02:53:30]  i like doing that guy  that's about it  yeah  what's the best impression of anybody  that you've ever seen anyone else do  like is there one that you look at  and just all go  oh fuck  ah  let me think about that for a second  i don't know  i think  um  um  um  um  um  come on  give me a minute  because there's a couple  sure  i mean  i've sent that  and i go  that's the best impression i've ever seen  yeah  um  who  how about you  name someone 
[02:54:00]  i mean  there's so many great ones  i mean uh  your sharpton is fucking  that's dead on  for the obvious reasons  that it sounds like sharpton  it has all his inflections  the fact that you're a white guy  doing sharpton  and most black guys can't  that's just an amazing impression  yeah thank you  i love jay moore's colin  i think is an odd one  yeah that is an odd one  jay moore does colin quinn  and it's so honorable  also i believe his uh  grisover walker  of course  walker's amazing  but his colin i think is better  because with colin  i never heard him do colin  well yeah 
[02:54:30]  it's not one he would try to pull out  because everybody would be going  who is that  it's amazing his colin  it's like talking  we had colin in here once  talking to him  he's a terrific impression  oh he's fucking  yeah  he's a psychopath  who saw that  you know  is he really  i didn't know that  well yeah i say that with affection  jay's nuts  i didn't tell you that  he's fucking great  jay's batshit crazy  yeah he's batshit crazy  oh yeah  yeah  that's why we all go along  he's a talented motherfucker  i'm a little bit too  yeah of course  i like the obscure impressions  that you know  just out of the way ones  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah 
[02:55:00]  um  god i want to  i want to  i know there have been a couple  where i look at it and go  wow  was there any rich little did  that you liked  or was he like  did you not like  was he like a hack  when you were a kid  or you respect him  no i loved him  and i still love him  yeah  i mean he did more  great impressions  than i guess anyone  i've ever seen  he was the go-to guy  back in uh  you know the 70s  i mean i think  i feel like i probably had  like five or ten great  impressions in my life  i think he probably had  100  he did a great carson  a great he didn't do  clues oh well  and i never forgave him  for that  but he did an amazing  he did an amazing johnny 
[02:55:30]  oh yeah you have a rich  little story right  which one  who was it you met  that brought you up  on stage or whatever  um  maybe i mixed you up  oh that was  someone else  oh someone else  okay someone else  was that  no it was  it was daryl  when  sure  when you're first  starting out  who's the performer  you still  oh my god  who was that pal talk  tell me  i don't know  he was on the show  he brought him up  oh i don't remember  oh no that might have  been kevin uh  no  kevin pollack 
[02:56:00]  kevin pollack  you're right  kevin pollack  does it  speaking of great  impressions  i'm on the shatner  shatner  kevin pollack's  shatner  he does a great  welcome but the  shatner  shatner's great  he has all the  inflections  not really touchable  yeah  yeah  it's probably awful  just as an impression  just being asked  about other ones  but i'm always  interested in what  would impress you  as being a fucking  what would be the  number one out there  which ones do you  look at and go  everybody likes that  it's easy  the guy that played  bush on mad tv  oh yeah yeah  is he the one  that died recently 
[02:56:30]  no frank uh  you know  oh frank  caliendo's great  fabulous  he's a great  impressionist  fabulous  i think that's  the  that's  um  his bush is  i would say as  good as impressions  can be  yeah he  really does a  great fucking  george w  he does a lot  of great ones  yeah  um  lots of great  ones yeah  the guy who  died who did  him and looked  like him uh  recently  yeah he was  very good  oh you think  caliendo's is  better  absolutely  oh okay  yeah  that's the  best bush  i've seen  the other guy  just looked  more like  and as good 
[02:57:00]  an impression  as i've ever  seen  um i think  uh j um  arrows uh  stephen a smith  is wonderful  who's stephen a  smith  uh commentator  on um  espn  oh sad  i wouldn't  recognize him  yeah  we got jay  doing colin  quinn  for 20 seconds  yeah  20 seconds  yeah  for daryl  this is quick  yeah colin's  on the phone  and then jay's  in studio  i think the  american people  are determined  to prove  they're not  racist  stop giggling  be a professional  for crying out loud  you know what i'm  saying 
[02:57:30]  stop talking like  that  you know what  i'm saying  yes  do i have a  head injury  that nobody  told me about  why wouldn't  we know  what you're  saying  you just  had a  simple  salient  point  brilliant  he gets  the words  that colin  would use  the way  he'd use  that  the way  you slide  into a  salient  point  it's a  mumble  slide  that colin  does  when he  talks  absolutely  unreal  colin's  hilarious  jay gets  smarter  when he does  that impression 
[02:58:00]  because he's  a dumbbell  and he does  that impression  and he's  fucking a genius  he gets  into a weird  mindset  that's what  i admire  about a  great impressionist  is when they  get into the  mindset of the  person  you can see  them thinking  it's really  fucking  incredible  do you ever  imagine  that your  face looks  like the  person's  face  when you  do the  impression  because  i've noticed  over the  years  trying to  do  certain  people  it helps  to  almost  imagine  you're  making  the same  mouth  or nose  some kind  of physical  thing  even though  you know  you're not 
[02:58:30]  looking like  the person  but just  to have  that  image  it kind  of helps  yeah  sure  when i was  doing them  i always  tried to pick  up on a  couple of  mannerisms  physical  facial  yeah  did you ever  do one that  you didn't  believe  like when  you're doing  one  i've done  plenty of  shitty ones  and you feel  like i'm  daryl i'm  daryl i'm  not the  person  like you  were  yeah plenty  of fucking  shitty  could you  give us  one example  that you  hated  oh fuck  there must  be 20  we asked  that knowing  you're brilliant  by the way  mccain mccain  mccain was  bad although 
[02:59:00]  i will say  this i did  do mccain  really well  once  and if  you can  look up  mccain  old  mccain  old  please look  that up  sure  old on  snl with  uh will  forte as  brian smith  all right  um but  but when  my dad died  and they  had like a  soldier's funeral  i could not  be i mean i  was out of my  mind i  couldn't do a  soldier  no shit  yeah i  couldn't you  know his  body and  voice were  affected by  what happened  to him in  war my  dad bonded 
[02:59:30]  about being a  soldier then i  didn't want to  play him anymore  right i don't  play him you  know but if  you can find  mccain old i  didn't but  then when i  went back to  do him in  the fall i  just couldn't  pull the trigger  again yeah  yeah  oh it's such a  shame we don't  have somebody  better than sam  yeah i know  it really is  on the computer  lady in the  horse gag porn  would do a  better job  googling  sam is  notoriously 
[03:00:00]  bad and in  fairness i did  do him well  one time  yeah  will forte  play by  williams it  had amy  polar in it  fred armison  the trouble  like the  hardest part i  believe would  be something  that's topical  because obviously  it's snl you  got you got to  be topical a  news story  happens and  then they  tell you hey  do this guy  yeah and  that's gotta be  frightening yeah  like when i  tried to play  mitch mcconnell  and it was  like i know  how much you  know i had  like no time  yeah yeah  um i 
[03:00:30]  mean i've  since you  know regretted  that because  i felt like i  gotta do a  you know a  pretty decent  one yeah  obviously the  donald trump  was fucking  amazing too  that was so  much fun  that wasn't  like very  accurate that  was but it  was so  exaggeration  sometimes that's  better than an  accurate great  mockery because it  was so  and i did  sean conry that  was an  exaggeration  right yeah  yeah you're  getting so  close dude  sam's almost  got it  that's it  here it is  is that it  yeah just tell  me if this is  not every page  is like a 
[03:01:00]  pretty good  mccain  what that's  where the  video was at  one point  oh come on  sam you're  breaking everything  stop breaking  it sam  you suck  oh man  sam you're  fired  it was pretty  good in fact i  had lots of  compliments on it  but then when i  came back in the  fall i was like i  don't want to do  this  yeah that's  what i did was  rather than imitate  the sounds that  came from his  physical abuse  and war  you know i  just came up  with another  version of him  that was good  enough to be  funny but it 
[03:01:30]  really wasn't  very satisfying  especially to  people who had  seen me do it  the first time  gotta be so  weird to change  doing an  impression  yeah  you know what  works i mean  there's no question  about it it's weird  oh come on man  oh sam you are  you are fucking  this whole thing  up sam  you're brilliant  that you can  even find that  oh sam  he is so not  brilliant  i actually have  it on my phone  blithering  yeah we could  play through your  phone  you could  yeah  man yeah  no just put the 
[03:02:00]  phone up to the  mic  yeah  we don't care  we do it all the  time  we've done it  works perfectly  sam  by the way  daryl hammond as  he finds the video  will be at  carolines  friday and  saturday  tomorrow and  saturday  carolines  212-757-4100  for daryl hammond  tickets  sam's doing like  a perfect impression  of a shitty  producer  yeah  it's like spot  on  he's actually  crazy  if there was a  guy if there  was a guy named  cunt who can't 
[03:02:30]  google  this would be the  greatest impression  of him  yes  it's wonderful  come on  you guys  mccain old  mccain old  please  oh man  i want to see  this now too  oh man  god damn it  come on  no  you don't do  commercials though  no we're finishing  nah  yeah we're  just about done  but we're at  10 o'clock  we're done  alright don't  wait i guess i  screwed it up  come on  i'll try  oh don't  you know something  it didn't happen  it didn't happen  you can just do it  you can just  like uh  find it 
[03:03:00]  take your time  kingston pizza  is jay farrow  now on snl  does a great denzel  oh really  denzel washington  i can't find him  sorry  dean edwards did a  great denzel too  yeah  i thought dean edwards  were underused  like he was a funny guy  i mean his impressions  were really  because chris rock  was great  oh he's wonderful  and he's great  michael jackson too  yeah yeah yeah  but not a hacky  michael jackson  oh and sydney  poitier was beautiful  did he do poitier  yeah he did  a beautiful poitier  i don't know if  it ever made it  on the air  but he did  yeah  very talented young man  yeah  are we rapping  oh man  yeah i guess 
[03:03:30]  i guess we are  sam uh  well you ruined  the end of the show  sam  no you're brilliant  you're brilliant  you're close  to finding that thing  obviously it's been pulled  oh man  yes  get the paperback book  it's a fascinating book  i love the book  what about the hardcovers  whatever you want  i ran in like two days  fascinating book  thank you  thank you  page turner  as they like to say  it's a short book  no page turner  as they say in the biz  thank you  oh  i really liked it  thank you sir  thank you  the opian anthony channel  presents 
[03:04:00]  a very chifterson  thanksgiving  you guys know  there's only  12 good comics  at a time  more legendary appearances  from our favorite  stand-up comics  coming up  double guns  motherfucker  more memorable  ona appearances  from the biggest  names in stand-up  a very chifterson  thanksgiving  continues  on the opian anthony  channel  yeah this is  joel mccale  talking about  punching chevy chase 
[03:04:30]  why would he  punch maryland  and uh  the future  i just paused  for the laughs  and the future  of community  and discussing  talk shows  like jeff probst  i fucking  love jeff probst  i miss his show  i dvr'd him  when they were on  i just watch him  over and over  jeff probst  i want to be him  someday  ricky lake  she's like a big  fat lake with tits  and then tony danza  remember on halloween  when he wore that  costume  and he had that 
[03:05:00]  fucking giant  pekker bulge  remember that thing  fucking giant  my mother was  watching that  she's like  chip  get in here  look at this  fucking guy's  got a huge  cock  just bulging  how are you sir  hi joel  there's joel mikhail  how you doing man  has been a while  look at you  look so much more  hollywood every time  you come in  you really do  thanks  you do man  when you were just  doing that cute  little clip show  he still does  the cute little clip show  i know 
[03:05:30]  but when he was  just doing that  that's my favorite  thing he does  i'm anorexic  when you get a  yeah  manorexic  i like to call it  manorexic  and he recognized  my beet juice  you bet  oh really  yes he did  he knew i was  drinking some beet juice  with some other vegetables  drinking are you juicing  i don't  i'm on a the  slow carb diet  i am not joking  when i'm now being  really what is a  slow carb diet  well uh  this guy should be  paying me by the way  uh there's this uh  book the four hour body  and uh it's got all 
[03:06:00]  these theories in it  but one of them is  this slow carb thing  where basically is like  during the week  it's basically  you're carb free  other than  beans and lentils  delightful  you lose all your  weight through gas  right  beans and lentils  but you can have  as much meat  fish  uh and you know  no fruits  what about pretzels  no fruits  no fruits  no dairy  fruits have carbs  in them  but that's  yeah but fruits  are healthy though 
[03:06:30]  i mean fruits  i think the good  outweighs the bad  in fruits  but then  so then  but then there's  a cheat day  where you can eat  pasta  like you're 14  years old  and i will have  a 12 pack of coke  i will go crazy  and the theory is  is that  uh you trick your  but like once your  body realizes  oh we are not  getting any sugar  uh your body goes  into a slight  starvation mode  and then you hit it  with this huge amount  of sugar  and it goes  oh we're fine  so your metabolism  keeps going fast  and then you hit it  back with the uh  is it working  i lost 20 pounds 
[03:07:00]  yeah but joe was  always thin though  i mean i never  thought you needed  to lose weight  looks all high  i am always in a  desperate uh because  when i have to take  my shirt off  for community  i'm constantly  insanely so very  self-conscious  that would be a  little crazy right  did you punch  chevy chase in  the face  not in the face  you punched him  uh i punched him  in the hand  oh you did  uh what happened  was was we were  we were shooting  our uh it was  first year christmas  episode and he  was teaching my  character how to  box and he was  wearing those pads  on his hands 
[03:07:30]  and he um he i we  were shooting the  scene and then he  would be like come  on hit me and i'm  i'm hitting him  and he's like you  you're not really  hitting me and i  was like you're  right because we  are shooting a tv  show that we are  this is pretend  it's called acting  i am playing a  character named  jeff and you're  playing fierce  we are not here  for me to hit you  and uh he was  like you pussy you  can't hit me and  i was like all  right so after we  kind of got through  most of the scene  i was like fine i'll  give you a left i  will throw a left 
[03:08:00]  into your left hand  and uh and then i  separated his  shoulder did you  really and i swear to  you it wasn't it  wasn't like i was  like mother i wasn't  like i was like here  i go it was more i  was gonna like i'll  just give him i'll  give him a good pop  and then he was  like ah and then of  course the crew was  like why did you do  that i'm like he was  begging me to hit  ours they meant  wanting you go for  the joy so now you  loved it do you have  any boxing uh  history at all no  no no i played a  punch played a lot of  football but there was 
[03:08:30]  not as many punches he  just you know do you  have a boxing history i  don't know my dad my  dad was a boxer and  he uh went to the  doctor when he was  like 65 and the  doctor went wouldn't  you break your nose  and he goes i never  broke my nose you  have a fracture right  here it healed and  then he figured out  like he was a  freshman in high  school he had broken  his nose and never  knew it he probably  had bad breathing for  his entire life  that was what one of  his nostrils was  slightly bigger because  the other one wasn't  getting it damn yeah  bad sleep problems and 
[03:09:00]  stuff like that that  yeah yeah you snored  a ton i love how  jimmy brings up the  fact that you separate  a 70 year old man's  shoulder and he's  like a boxing  experience  my fucking sister  could have done that  to chevy no but i  was just curious if he  did though because he  was taking it easy  that's what made me  i'm like maybe joel  knows he throws a  really good punch and  he doesn't want to  hurt uh chevy chase  well but i did make  it look like it was  fucking forming you  knocked out  i did i must i did  it wasn't expecting  that him to that to  happen right how good 
[03:09:30]  did it feel to hear  him go like oh  even though he's  old i first thought  he was kidding i was  like oh you asshole  and he was like no  you really hurt me i'm  like oh it's like you  asked me to i look  like the dick yeah  used to do all those  pratfalls damn you  we all know he suffers  from does he he suffers  from uh well great pain  from those oh yeah from  the old pratfalls from  is that true you think  he was peeing blood after  he fell down one of them  really fell down a set of  stairs so that's a good  yeah and i guess that  got him on some of 
[03:10:00]  the painkillers and  stuff like that you  always come in here  we only talk about  chevy we're obsessed  with someone trashing  him it is it is the  it's the the blast  radius of him yes it  consumes a lot of  confidence is he  finally out of your  life is he finally out  of your hair he's off  the show i know i  know i know season four  starts and he's in a  couple episodes he's in  all the episodes oh he  is all of them he made  it in all of no and i  believe me and i i want  the man i want to shake  him and go i mean for 
[03:10:30]  a long time just like  dude everyone loves you  love you are loved you  you won you won right  right and uh but he's  just not he just didn't  want to be there uh-huh  it's amazing why  wouldn't you want to be  on a tv set doing a gig  yeah man it's not it's  what else are you doing  it's a great i think he's  a very funny comic actor  i think he's great he's  a great show too man  yeah he just he would say  in articles that he didn't  want to be there he was  doing it for the money and  he didn't like the writing  what a fucking self  destructive what do you  think his problem is  overall because so many

[03:13:00]  we were arguing because she  had she worked at a  fucking clothing store and  there was a guy in the  dressing room and she  noticed how big his cock was  through his underpants and  she kept going back in and  giving him pants i'm like you  were fucking looking and  then it bothered me and  then she goes what did you  not like she said to me did  you not know that you're not  an abercrombie model she  said that to me holy shit  what a fucker you have a  great you have a good  girlfriend that's the ex  girlfriend but then i  wound up but that was a  turning point for me because  then i wound up getting  turned on by the fact that  she was staring at this big  bulge and it changed our 
[03:13:30]  relationship for the better  but that was the weekend i  was in florida so did you  have to then every time to  get turned on would you be  like let's go all i would  do is talk to her about  beach no i would just i  would just make her tell me  about it was he a nice guy  to you i never met him  no tosh oh he was great  yeah well he just he  interviewed me for this uh  this he was doing  wraparound interviews for  comedy central yeah it was  very cool we reached out  to him we just went to our  show or acknowledged that  we're asking so oh really  who are you asking our  fans have got a hold of  him as well he has a lower 
[03:14:00]  level of desperation than i  do oh man also dude also  on at mentions though you  got six million we had mike  tyson in here last week joel  you're in good company  that's pretty good all right  how's his face he looks  good he looks great that  tattoo on his face  it really all of a sudden  you get used to it it's  weird because it's a famous  tattoo now that's why it  doesn't matter yeah you are  used to it you're just kind  of like yeah it's that guy  if someone you work with  came in with that tattoo it  would be really creepy and  awkward but it's forever and  now it's it's the famous  tattoo yeah yeah does he  still get paid um i heard  he got paid him he was 
[03:14:30]  paying him in that  documentary gets paid a  million bucks just to work  out in the casino really  oh jesus we got the  that's how he looks  he looks terrific he looks  great he looks thinner and  we got the low-key version  this time around we've  talked to him twice the  first time he was out of  his mind it was hilarious  and the second time he  was chill a million years  to work out in a casino  like as his gym that's i  think it's in the middle  of the casino and people  are doing their you know  slot machines and playing  cards and he's boxing in  the middle of the thing  oh and they give him a 
[03:15:00]  million i think they give  him a million a year to do  how many times we could  ask him how often i think  it's daily just keep down  on the flash photography  look it up i might be  totally wrong but i think  that would add up quick  but uh a million dollars a  shot no no no no a  million dollars a year a  year okay just to work out  a fucking price savior and  those boxers are used to  working out in front of  people they had used to  the press being there in  public they don't give a  fuck yeah and they want to  just work out and he loves  and he has a bird collection  yeah he always liked homie 
[03:15:30]  pigeons and stuff yeah i  just want to acknowledge you  were great in ted thank you  man i don't really have a  question there i just i just  liked you in ted is that  getting getting you more  movies uh not yet but maybe  because you were all also  good in that movie that  unfortunately no one saw  with anna faris the numbers  yeah what's your number  yeah that was oh yeah that  was uh you should see the  deleted scenes of ted because  i'm uh i'm naked with a  female bodybuilder all right  yeah it's uh i don't know  why i once again passed over 
[03:16:00]  for an oscar and now look at  that he's hosting the no kids  right seth mcfarland yeah  oh right and that show was  canceled for a while that was  one of the shows the fans  brought back right yeah  talk about a comeback i'm an  amazing comeback he yeah i  mean that guy yeah i still  love family guy yeah it's  still and it's still going  yeah and he wrote and  directed i mean he was ted  was entirely him right and  as there was all these like  people had passed on it and  we're like they just don't  get it why would anybody want 
[03:16:30]  to watch this movie yeah yeah  and uh and it obviously  worked out very well yeah  absolutely you have uh  another season uh season  four i mean i mean uh did  they pick up another not for  the fifth season they haven't  picked up anything yet no no  okay uh we'll we'll know  pretty quickly after these  next few weeks of rain yeah  it's that isn't it great  living and dying by these  fucking by ratings uh yeah  it's the high seas you got  enough shows for syndication  because that's where no we  well excuse me we are 
[03:17:00]  syndicated we're syndicated  through hulu and now we're  syndicated common central so  they that's already started  okay uh but we will be up  to 84 the magic number is  100 uh so more season you  need half a season just to  get if you get within 95 to  100 you're you're gold and  without exact numbers how  much more money would that be  for you a year oh my uh i  think i'll make 35 million  dollars uh starting but that  money you know it starts  syndication money is a lot that's 
[03:17:30]  right i've already picked out  an island see it's gonna be  by the way non-showbiz dummy  throws in syndication money is  a lot yes that's what i answer  that's what i add to the  discussion unless you're  fucking gilligan i added  nothing guys that really i mean  those people they got screwed  it's like hey by the way  tremendous grasp of the  obvious do you think when they  were filming things like uh the  brady bunch and gilligan's  island stuff that uh they were  like yeah in fucking 30 years  they're still gonna be rolling 
[03:18:00]  this crap and you're not gonna  see dime one right you want  they gotta want to kill  themselves yeah not a money  that would have made crazy it  is one of the most rerun shows  in history yeah pretty much oh  my god yeah who doesn't like to  just sit down and have some  laughs to gilligan's island you  look at what show you know you  look what like seinfeld or  drew carey or any of those guys  and but they were creators of  the show but and but people who  are like on star trek next  generation yeah which is the  biggest syndication deal of all  time is it really biggest huge  drama definitely huh uh and 
[03:18:30]  then uh and then i think  seinfeld now seinfeld are  friends the biggest comment  seinfeld do they get money  star trek guys they do get  money oh so they by that  point because the only  honeymoonist person that got  money was odd was uh joyce  randolph because her brother  was a lawyer so she was the  funniest one on the show  absolutely she stole it  stole the show oh i didn't  know that yeah one of the  syndication monies uh become  official it's been a while  they didn't say you mean when  did that really start getting  for everybody i don't think  till the 80s yeah mash must  have been yeah all the family 
[03:19:00]  before that everyone got  screwed everyone got screwed  oh man but then not as i mean  think about all the musicians  in the 50s and 60s like the  guy who wrote remember earth  angel the one that was in yeah  yeah yeah yeah that he sold  that song for like 300 bucks  yeah yeah probably five probably  feeling all good about it bb  king's like famous for bringing a  pistol to when he gets paid he  just sets it down and he goes i'm  being paid now because they  were just they would always do  like hey thanks for the  concert you frame like ah see  you later oh yeah we well you  haven't counted the receipts 
[03:19:30]  yet and uh yeah we'll uh  we have a printing press for  money that we have to get to  warm it up yeah it's it's a  good problem but they they did  make well i don't know if they  made great money but in  conventions and things yeah yeah  but it wasn't like  education money it wasn't what  they should have made they um  that's kind of the thing to do  is get a little bit part in a  sci-fi show because then  you could just ride that  convention shit for the rest  of your life you can ride it  forever i've seen who goes to  some of those uh cons and 
[03:20:00]  there it's hilarious it's like  that was the girl that was like  the little sister in a twilight  zone episode right and there she  is hello honey you might remember  she's got a picture of her when  she was three  she's still signing shit how much  could they make though it's like  just standing there there's  nothing sadder at a convention  and an empty booth it's like how  much could they make man cat food  and some water i wonder how much  they make it's got some of them  are by autograph yeah yeah yeah  oh you're rocking sam they go to  those things all the time i can  tell you all about it i love those 
[03:20:30]  things like you like going to  i love because you're a crazy  person that loves pictures with  anyone that had any celebrity at  any time it's the craziest fun but  you can't really walk around it and  know it out and i yeah i'm on the  spectrum of that show i'm you're  very recognizable like the big bang  people they will be killed oh  they will be like we want to  sacrifice you god that's amazing  they yeah no it's that have you  been there i've been to a few of  them yeah yeah they're very 
[03:21:00]  entertaining i like the sci-fi ones  and the horror ones yeah like they  launch some movies thinking this is  like the buzz will be like when  avatar was being launched people  yeah they were like oh i don't know  and it was but then like jonah  hex gets launched there yeah yeah  everyone's like this is like so much  buzz and then it what's jonah  nothing that was josh brolin's big  um that was the the it's a comic  book and at least at comic-con it was  the kind of thing that was promoted  it got a ton of people at the forums 
[03:21:30]  and they just don't know they don't  know crap over there but it didn't  work out for josh brolin at all they  lose money on it and like yeah  probably meaning but josh brolin's  gonna be i think josh brolin he's  amazing to work he'll be all right  you think yeah he'll be he'll be  just fine oh you got to tell us  what season four is going to be all  about well he's starting up tomorrow  you said right yeah we all this is  everyone dies  that would be a really funny way to  end the series why not great uh the  we will have a lot of holidays which 
[03:22:00]  is going to our our halloween episode  is going to be awesome when it airs on  valentine's day  very very confusing we have  thanksgiving and christmas so it's  going to be yeah you did you're  throwing a lot of holiday episodes  they we tape well we were supposed  to air in on october 19th uh-huh and  then they moved our date four months  oh my gosh you're not a kid you are  screwed i'm not kidding that goes yeah  so we it doesn't make any sense that is  the oddest thing but for community  fans thank god they yeah they'll be 
[03:22:30]  all right i always thought it was weird  when you're watching a show and  syndication you're watching a rerun of  something and uh there's like a  christmas episode and it's you know  april yeah you just kind of oh i'm out  of it oh they took me out of it they  also got lazy middle management  yeah or when you watch it like  seinfeld to do this because they play  a lot of uh syndicated episodes of  popular shows back to back they'll do  like an hour an hour and a half of  some things and they'll play the first  part of a show in the first half hour 
[03:23:00]  and then they'll just willy-nilly  throw something else in the second  yeah they assume like bag you probably  saw the second half anyway they're just  gonna mix it up they do that with the  simpsons too yeah they just shave off  five or ten minutes off of it so what  i'm anywhere i was like this is not  how this ended this yeah yeah this  isn't the ending that they left out  the middle part they got to fit more  commercials in now yeah simpsons have  been around so long that they they had  more room back yeah that's what that's  all about dick van dyke was on yeah  29 and a half minutes it's like 29 and 
[03:23:30]  a half minutes amazing right a 30  second commercial so that's one 30  second what do they do now though what  do they do 21 and a half minutes oh i  is gerato 21 and a half minutes that's  it it goes like the first act is like  11 or 12 minutes long it's the long  you're there or 14 minutes and then  second act is like uh it's like eight or  seven minutes and then the third act is  usually nothing so it's usually yeah  they already got you by that point so  you're gonna stay yeah playing under the  fucking credits don't bitch about 
[03:24:00]  commercials too much the guy to your  right is a big commercial guy coming up  now hey he's a big sponsor of our show  he loves you know what we want to give  you guys are going to sell a lot of these  tin roses  we want to give you our first celebrity  gift bag  with a 24 karat gold dip rose those are  24 karat gold my friend  speaking of valentine's day and shows being out of order  ah there are wonderful numerous thai  restaurants these are featured in  give them to your friends don't put them

[03:29:00]  if you breathe in the asbestos  it will stay with you forever  when you breathe in the asbestos from the tin rose  joel i i gotta ask you about uh of course uh the soup or soup or whatever the hell they're calling it these days  some of the uh opinion on some of the recent videos that uh have you seen that gentleman um that cracked that guy in the head with the hatchet that will be in the show tonight that will be in the show tonight that will be in the show tonight one of the best videos  he was looking for a gold rose to crack his head yeah use the hatchet that guy rules 
[03:29:30]  so lamb i will take in one swipe with the gold rose because yeah could have slid his wrist or hit him over the head what do you think of that guy it seems like it's out of um a stoner movie  it's like it's out of biodome  or undercover brother or something  where you're like this is too good to be this is too real  too many good things in there  it's it's a crazy guy the car hitting someone people coming to the rescue and then a guy grabbing a girl and then the stoner guy hitting him with an axe 
[03:30:00]  where do you get the hatchet he's traveling with it because he was homeless  yeah he probably had that with him all the time  he's a homeless hitchhiker so you gotta have some kind of weapon  when i need to eat i just kill someone  yeah with a hatchet or a tin rose  it's amazing  yeah  because i i think on the soup because i know it's in the show but we checked i think two days ago or whenever it went up  that i was like 5 000 views and now it's millions  a million now it's up there  that guy's the best  that will be an all-time 
[03:30:30]  that's gonna be a biggie  it hit the news today they're that far behind so now people are really gonna start viewing it  it's got to be the weird for the  news people because it's not exactly a kicker story  because someone's dead  right so it's not all fun and games  it won't be  yeah  look at this cat skateboarding  right  now what about uh atlanta security guard  have you indulged in him at all  that tased that woman  that had all the  little kids around  and was giving him crap  and they got in a little fight  there's apparently the security guard in uh atlanta

[03:32:00]  apple commercial  no  it's incredible  yeah  um  you'll have to just  i'm gonna have to  yeah i'll punch that one  he uh  what he said  it's the zoe dashanel one  who is delightful and cute  she is  but uh  but this  but he has some pretty incredible jokes in it  but uh  with dr oz  we  we call him old memet head  because that's his fucking  and he's like  he's like  hey  i'm the richest man in the world  i don't give a fuck  i i i get  oprah is on my money  that's yeah  yeah  it's produced pal  have you uh 
[03:32:30]  checked out um  jeff probst's show  uh show  it's cancelled  oh  still on though  so they're just running some episodes  showbiz name like that  i watched a couple of episodes  i could not turn away  i  he's engaging  he's very  i like the guy  do you like him  he  i don't mind him  it was very awkward  it was an awkward show  he seemed out of his element  and his guests  were  i mean  on our worst day 
[03:33:00]  we've had better guests  than he had coming on  they were  they were just terrible  need a lot of money behind them  who cares guests  yeah they didn't help him out too well  i mean we used to  i i like that  but he uh  but we used to make fun of the tony danza show  and  one of my favorites  uh i love  i mean  and i  what happens with those syndicated shows  is they pick  they guarantee them a certain amount of time  then they cancel it  but they still have to fulfill their order  while they  when  when uh danza went down  rachel ray was the next one up  and it clearly worked  danza  his 
[03:33:30]  i loved his monologue  he had no clue what to do  with  with like  segues  that's what we called it  danzitions  oh the danzitions  that was it  danzitions  because he would  he would be like  uh  yeah well you know  the horrible accident  thoughts and prayers  go out to the  the families and stuff  isn't a banjo a great instrument  and i i was in  it was horrifying watching him  because it was so uncomfortable  like  this  something so bad is going to happen  i'm just going to be embarrassed  for everyone involved  but it's danza 
[03:34:00]  so he  there's something so  like enduring about it  where he was just like  hey jets won again  sad news  two little girls will kill you  yes  and you  danzitions  i forgot that's what he called them  yeah  we call that  and we  he had me on the show  and he was very good to me  yeah  did you see the spider-man  outfit that he had on  for um  no  for uh  he had a bulge  and his  it got to the point  where the guests  were uncomfortable  and he had to tie something  around his waist  they made him cover up 
[03:34:30]  it was  it was really  it's a good show  that's pretty good  a great show  i missed tony  he is missed  and that rachel ray show  just got canceled  did it  who's the big up and comers  because uh  also  no rachel  excuse me  i'm sorry  ricky lake  ricky lake  jeez no  rachel ray  yes  ricky lake didn't make  it huh  no  wow  how long was she  that seems quick  yeah  that seems very quick  they finally brought her back  after all these years  and she fell  because there's no value  in it anymore  because it's not surprising  anymore  i mean there's nothing  she can cover anymore  that's not being covered  or hasn't been covered 
[03:35:00]  500 times  right  if she had stuck with  it was one of those  she left a working gig  i mean it was  yeah  it was going well  and if you were to  i feel like if you stick  with one of those things  then you  you get all those people  that started from the beginning  you can't come back  you can't recapture that  you have to springer  and maury  and there's just no  no desire for it  yeah springer maury  still going  how long was she off  10 years or more  yeah yeah  wilco's doing good  i don't know how springer  keeps his eyes open  during a show  i'm sorry  he just doesn't ring a bell

[03:37:30]  because there's so many  of those  uh  we try to wait  for a great clip  but they're  they  those shows  to me  they get insanely boring  yeah  because it's all set up  where they're like  yes  ah i can't  linda says  she wants me to meet her  at down at the recording studio  i can't believe  i have to go down there  do do do do do  and then  the driving music  it's terrible  oh my gosh  josh groban's gonna be there  josh groban's a terrible  example  because you would never do it  but then

[03:38:30]  people almost  they treat them like  they're characters  uh-huh  and so i'd be getting  asked on red carpet  like so what do you think  taylor's like taylor's  husband  maybe they should have  invited cameras  into their home  maybe  they shouldn't have  done that  i was like  it's terribly sad  obviously  he didn't  it sounded like  he had some  a lot of problems  maybe you stop  deal with those  problems in private  and uh  that something's  gone horribly wrong  yeah  but they're more  but they were  they were like  oh okay  instead of being like  so his character's dead  what do you think

[03:51:00]  anniversary of the  declaration of  independence  it was also the  year nasa released  the famous face on  mars photo taken  by viking one  and the year the  scottish base city  rollers invaded north  america  75  476  and you like that  that is  yeah it was great  you get to post  everything  something  wait and see  yeah  you gotta hold  on me  s-a-t-u-r  it's crazy  but it's  crazy  t-u-r  t-u-i  what do you mean 
[03:51:30]  he gave you  something  he gave you  something  talked about  1976  we do that  laundry list  then hoping that  it might spark  some comedy  you know what else  he just gave you  a laundry list  of shit that  happened in 76  who cares  because he's on  the 70s channel  and he was  playing a song  from 76  but it comes up  when the song  plays  right  it tells you  the year  it comes up  it takes all  the guest record  out of it  then you could  just pick up  your phone  and go  1976  you hit it  and you find  out what  happened  yourself  so you don't  really need  a jock anymore  because all  that info  is now on  the radio  I have another  question about  these channels 
[03:52:00]  like the 80s  and 70s  how come on  the 70s channel  it'll put the  date of the song  but on  what is it  vinyl  what's the other  channel  classic vinyl  classic vinyl  why does it not  put the date  they might play  the album version  too of the song  too  so where the  70s channel  might be playing  Do It Again  by Steely Dan  play the 70s  the single version  and nobody knows  when the album  was put out  what year  and we care why  I liked it  I do like a good  date on there  I do like a date  of my songs 
[03:52:30]  I do too  I can listen  and I go  I remember that  but you don't  need the jock  giving you the year  if it says it  on there  sometimes if you  have to hit the  post  1976  classic vinyl  doesn't tell you  I don't like this  if you got music  jocks you should  set them free  and let them  do their shit  excited Denny  gets about a year  being blurted out  before the music  starts  by the way  this was  what was his name  David Norton  yes  he was in  American Werewolf  in London

[03:56:00]  all I did was hear stuff Bobby  that was for me and you and Jim  more for you and Bobby  Jim didn't get his taste  Jim is still on air  so I don't know  if anything's wrong with Jim yet  I don't know  I'm going to go to AIDS  with that fucking money  are you kidding  what's up man  what's going on  we've just been hanging  bullshitting  just hanging  how was the garden  Chris Rock  I think tweeted  or texted  or put it on Facebook  it was one of the best comedy shows  you ever saw  holy shit  let me tell you what's crazy about Chris 
[03:56:30]  Chris bought tickets  he didn't even call me for tickets  like  he just showed up  and came  which was amazing  like  I think that's bigger than  that's bigger than someone  saying they're coming  and  supporting you  the fact that Chris Rock  came  bought tickets  and then showed them  after  well if someone could peel off hundreds  better than you  it's Chris Rock  well no  first of all  let me tell you  the biggest  shock to my ego  so in LA  a friend of mine  is having a birthday party  at a comedy club  his name is Chris Spencer  been out in LA for a long time 
[03:57:00]  everybody always comes  to his birthday  all the comedians  come out  and say hey  and go on stage  so literally  I think I'm going last  I show up late  yo  Kevin Hart's coming  oh my god  Kevin Hart's on stage  I come on stage  happy birthday Chris  I do a little set  and he was like  how do you follow Kevin Hart  oh my god  Chris Rock  ladies and gentlemen  oh shit  Chris just comes up after me  oh damn  it doesn't matter  he just came up after me  it doesn't matter  well or not  he couldn't go on stage 
[03:57:30]  and talk about anything  did they all say  you don't belong there  because Kevin was just here  or were they happy to see him  no they went  they went crazy  I think they immediately  forgot that I was even on stage  oh shit  immediately  but that's the power  of Chris Rock  that's why he's amazing  I'm in an airport  at like 6 in the morning  I'm exhausted  I just did 7 shows  at an improv  he comes walking through  like it's fucking  4 in the afternoon  Versace matching everything  right  with an entourage  and a hot chick  and he walks 
[03:58:00]  he looks at me  I'm tired  I got like a  fucking honey bun  in one hand  a coffee  in front of everybody  he goes  what the fuck  happened to you man  oh shit  then he goes  he goes yo man  you need me to get you  through security  I got a lady  that just walks me through  did you wait in line  did you do that  cause I don't wait in line  but if you need me  I was so  the last person  in the world  and I just kicked  this fucking stupid  you didn't need that 
[03:58:30]  no  he had no energy  to do anything else  the only thing  he extended  was his foot  that's the only thing  that moved  was the bottom  of his foot  he gets the lady  who walks you through  he doesn't  he doesn't go  through security  that's what happens  Bobby  there's a fat lady  in a red vest  that's fucking great  this is a love of life  don't it  yeah they're called  the greeters  they walk you through  they just walk you through  I don't like to  wow that's nice  you can get that too  Bobby  you just gotta pay for it  yeah that's all Bobby 
[03:59:00]  you just gotta pay for it  why don't you  money you just pay for it  I fucking hate you  I really do  holy shit  he just  he really  he really does  know how to rub it in  he's the best  that is good  how much is a greeter  how much is it  to get a greeter  I don't look at bills  I couldn't tell you guys  I don't even know  oh shit  who knows  whatever right  they're nice people  they're great  that's it  they're great people  when did you reach the point  where you didn't even have to 
[03:59:30]  look at bills anymore  or fucking like  you just knew it was  gonna get paid  no matter what you bought  you knew it wasn't  gonna interfere  with your fucking living  well here's the thing  if you as a human  say you're at the point  where you don't look at bills  it means you're dumb  because it means  everybody's robbing you  well that's probably  so I always look at bills  that's just me joking  you don't have to worry  about them  oh yeah  worry about them  is different  no you know  I'm okay  financially  but you know  in the back of my mind  it can always go back  to what it was  and these guys  definitely know  what it used to be  yeah 
[04:00:00]  were you like broke  oh it was beyond that  it was a level  it was broke  and there was a level  underneath broke  I remember your car  you just had a shit car  no no no  that's what I said  they know  like they know  where it was  so my appreciation  for where I am right now  is at a different level  oh shit  you know  the reason why  I can act like this  with them  is because you can only  be like this  with people that know you  yeah well you'd be  a complete asshole  if you just walked up  to strangers  and he knows  we won't cry  until he leaves  it's literally like 
[04:00:30]  you can be the guy  that you always  wanted to be  and act like  with your friends  that really know you  you can be obnoxious  you can be a jerk  yeah of course  fuck you  but it's good  because it's with your friends  that really know you  but you know  for me  it's a certain level  of appreciation  and humbleness  that comes  with getting to what you got  that makes you go  okay breathe deep  this is crazy  this is amazing  relishing it  but at the same time  stay focused  you don't want it to stop  so it's  there is that 
[04:01:00]  yeah that's  that's really the fucking  the niche of the whole thing  is like  oh fuck  now I gotta sustain this shit  because the fear  of going back  to picking up  fucking half oatmeal cookies  under the locker  on the floor  of the school  and eating it  he did that  there was an oatmeal cookie  on the ground  and he ate it  under the locker  in school  and he ate it  oh I ate that fucking cookie  the fear of taking  verbal abuse  from two guys  who you know  don't look better than you  oh shit  that's the worst thing ever 
[04:01:30]  that's the nightmare  for you  that's the nightmare  the fear of sitting  hey Kevin what happened  yeah just the fear  look at you  look at you  the fear is to walk  back into the cellar  broke and Keith  not even bad  and I  we knew you'd be back  stupid  yeah  yeah  are you careful  with like  I'm sure you are  but your business managers  and stuff  like I don't let anybody  even on my financial level  I don't let anybody  have power of attorney  I give everybody  power of attorney  and I just sit there  because it's so convenient  they would never steal 
[04:02:00]  no one would ever steal  from me  I'm too nice  no  I went through that road  I had business managers  before  I've been broke  after having money  before  oh man  you went through  you went through  a well off  and then a broke  yes  that's the best lesson  to learn  it's the best lesson ever  fuck that  it's only the best lesson  once you get fucking money again  once you get money again  I was gonna say  it's the best lesson  but here's the thing  they never stole from me  nobody ever stole from me  my business managers  never stole from me  it was people working for me 
[04:02:30]  that just did their jobs  in other words  they paid bills  paid taxes  but nobody explained to me  how money worked  how taxes worked  and at the young age  of 25, 26  you know  you get these checks  and you're thinking  they're yours  and this is your money  oh yeah  they didn't take anything out  10% to the agent  10% to the manager  30% to the government  they didn't tell me anything  it was just  okay  time to pay this  and wipe  and you're like  hammer time  what do you mean  I got a dream of dollars left  I just had  so that was a lesson I learned  I got audited once 
[04:03:00]  it's terrible  oh yeah  it's the most disgusting thing ever  yeah  I almost jumped out  a fucking window  why did they  audited you Bobby  what were they  they didn't have anything  they ordered  they ordered  it's fucking easy for me  what were they doing  Bobby  what were you doing  to get audited  that you fill out  when you're gonna get  a fucking  $100 refund  Bobby  will you get the  fucking food  off your face  please  Jesus Christ  Bobby  will you just  not be big  for two seconds  I told him 
[04:03:30]  and Keith  when I first  moved back  from LA  that I got  a joint bank  account  with my chick  they smashed  me  I remember  I had notebooks  and papers  and they ripped  them all up  in the car  and threw me out  in Jersey City  and well they should  get out of the car  it was the most  in love thing  I've ever seen  in my life  what  we both got  the same bank account  she sees  what I see  what do you mean  let me tell you  a little something  about a joint  fucking bank account  when you get  when she gets  a divorce lawyer  and then you go  to the bank 
[04:04:00]  to take half  the money out  half for me  half for her  of the 40,000  that was all  I had in the  whole world  and I go and  fill out a  20,000 dollar  withdrawal slip  you see where  this is going  don't you  and I'm told  Mrs. Kumia  the account  is closed  there's nothing  in there  oh well  what happened  oh yes  the other  account holder  took out  and I was going  there to take  20,000 out  half  and she  because you're  a nice guy  and then she  took that  and then I still  had to pay  or legal fees  and support  and I'm like 
[04:04:30]  but wait a minute  she took 40,000  but Bobby  was so in love  it was so  it was so like  he had that thing  in his neck  like what  you know  when you squint  your neck  and you can see  a heart  on the side  of it  we share  everything  he had no idea  he had no idea  and they finally  stopped that  when she got  disgusted  with the amount  he was putting in  she asked for a  prenup  let's relax 
[04:05:00]  you don't make  that money  oh man  that was just  not nice  yo  I'm fucking  happy to see  y'all man  it's good to see  you man  I'm always happy  I've been watching  our roots  on BET  Jesus  wait a minute  what just  happened  it's great  want to get some  cream for his  hands  let me tell you  I saw some old  Amos and Andes  and it was  fabulous  I was watching  Black Week  on BET

[04:08:00]  Dallas Austin  it might have  been but  he bet  Keith that he  would have  only X  amount of  yards  he'll have  this many  touchdowns  but he got  hurt the first  game of the  season  but Keith  didn't think  that he owed  the money  but you did  the money  because you  know that's  the risk  you take  and you say  he won't have  X amount of  touchdowns  if he gets  hurt  too bad  let me get  the funniest  story about  Keith  and Keith  he's gonna  kill me tomorrow  for telling me  this story  but it's the  best thing ever  this is like  three years ago  right  so Keith calls me  on the phone  he's like  stupid  he's like
