<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with the hosts' typical profane banter and sarcastic commentary, with Jim Norton present and complaining about a malfunctioning microphone.  Their previous night's escapades in Georgetown, Washington D.C., were recounted, including a humorous encounter with someone they believed to be the German Chancellor at a restaurant frequented by Bill Clinton.  This was followed by a detailed and crude description of their shopping experience at Lush, a soap store, where Jim Norton and Martini Steve purchased a significant quantity of soaps, with much comedic exaggeration of the scents and textures.

The conversation then shifted to American Idol, focusing on Carrie Underwood and Bo Bice, with Dee Dee joining the studio and listener calls contributing to the discussion.  A humorous misunderstanding of a news report about an arrest concluded this section, along with a brief promotion of the "O&A Party Rock."

A subsequent segment started with jokes about the average sexual intercourse durations of men from different countries, particularly targeting Turkish men. This transitioned into a shocking news story from Marietta, Georgia, about a drunk driver who accidentally decapitated his vomiting friend and drove home without noticing. This sparked a discussion about blackouts and drunken driving experiences among the hosts.  Dee Dee was again present, bringing a bag of sex toys, prompting a discussion and demonstration (with accidental whipping of a host) involving a three-ringed cock ring and a whip.  A caller, Kent, then played a segment from another radio show discussing a female athlete's unusual baseball pitch, leading to a physics-based discussion.  The show briefly touched upon Jay Leno's testimony in the Michael Jackson trial before veering into the presenter's experiences as a witness, including a humorous anecdote about O.J. Simpson and Robert Blake.  Producer Ben became the subject of gossip, his small cell phone, inappropriate laughter, and gossiping about Boston being highlighted.  The discussion then turned to legal repercussions of employing women in radio, specifically a $10.6 million lawsuit related to a perfume allergy.  The segment concluded with a listener-submitted Psycho Ex-Girlfriend remix featuring Alan Sniffen and further discussions of sexual harassment lawsuits.

A heated argument between Opie and an unnamed individual, likely a romantic partner, dominated the beginning of another segment, featuring strong insults and emotional outbursts. This transitioned into playing and mocking listener-submitted audio clips, particularly *American Psycho* remixes and Alan Sniffen's jingles. A caller, Mike, shared a humorous military anecdote from Kuwait involving a sexual harassment complaint stemming from his company's motto, "all beef."  This led to a discussion of cultural differences and observations about Kuwaiti military personnel.  More listener submissions were played and criticized, followed by a discussion of a poorly reviewed Sirius portable radio and a hijacked Hyundai online petition.  A boating safety PSA from an Amber Frye movie ("Pussy to Kill For") was discussed, followed by commentary on inept news reporting, and a news report about an armed fugitive on a crane, prompting dark humor and violent suggestions.  More listener-submitted audio, including a violent and sexually charged Ron and Fez remix, was played, leading to insults directed at rival radio shows and their staff, including a jab at a "Drunk Bitch Friday" segment.  A listener call updated the hosts on Lex and Terry’s negative comments about the Opie and Anthony show, leading to a discussion of their phone number, interpreted jokingly as sexually suggestive. The segment ended with more listener audio, commentary on listener behavior, a Tom Selleck impersonation, and Dee Dee’s news segment featuring bizarre and humorous news stories.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of a prostitution case involving a Christian school teacher in Peoria, Illinois.  A caller then asked Dee Dee about her panty preference, leading to a humorous segment on mispronunciations of "satin."  The discussion then centered on Dr. Sue Johanson and her sex advice, including the use of a butt plug while vacuuming.  A large portion of this segment was dedicated to sexually explicit conversations with Dee Dee, with graphic descriptions and suggestive banter about sexual acts, menstruation, and anal sex. Callers contributed their own euphemisms for sexual acts and experiences, with detailed descriptions of sexual encounters.  Labiaplasty and Dr. Johanson's advice were critiqued.  Jim Gaffigan appeared as a guest, discussing awkward experiences on small-town morning shows and run-ins with network executives due to Dee Dee's behavior. The segment ended with promotion of Gaffigan's stand-up show and a Gamefly.com advertisement.


The final segment highlighted Jim Gaffigan's negative experience with a radio station in Addison, Texas, including a heated argument with Opie.  This transitioned to a discussion of a seemingly negative comment by Lex and Terry, prompting playful insults and banter among Opie, Anthony, and Gaffigan.  A significant portion involved a call-in segment featuring a clip from Dr. Sue Johanson's show about children exploring their bodies, sparking a humorous and sexually explicit discussion about children's sexuality and masturbation. The show concluded with promotion of Gaffigan's and Jim Norton's shows, with further lighthearted banter and offensive jokes about various topics including tampons and women's choices. Dee Dee also participated in this segment.

[00:00:00]  Satsang with Mooji 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bat to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  I want that back.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down  Syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  How did you see that, jerk? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  You will be molested.  Oh, good Lord. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Morning, pig.  And welcome to the ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Jim Norton already annoyed.  I hear his creaky microphone.  That's all he would talk about on the way to Georgetown last night for dinner.  This is creaky microphone. 
[00:05:30]  You all right, Jimmy?  I am.  Cool, man.  Yeah.  As long as it looks good.  That's all he was talking about in the cab.  I like how there's no grease on these things.  It looks nice.  I remember when people were talking about the show.  They were saying the one thing that they liked about it is they could sense there was  no grease on the microphone.  They didn't care about the quality of the show.  They said, you know what?  Well, the creaky doesn't bother us at all as long as we can sense that it's a clean atmosphere.  Yeah.  Because I think that would bother people if they were listening and thought, I think  there's probably grease on the mic, Booms, and that bugs me. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Well, there's a lack of communication between, like, the geeks and us.  I was going to come up with a word for us.  We'll just call it us.  Us.  The tools.  Like, to them, logically, it makes sense not to have grease all over the mic stands.  Because they assume that you could just sit in front of a mic and not touch it.  Right.  Right.  For the whole show.  It doesn't have to move.  You put it where it is, you talk into it.  Not like Jimmy.  You've got to walk around and move it. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, you stand.  Yeah, he stands.  Because he's a stand-up comic.  And stand-up comics are used to kind of even holding the mic and moving around.  Right.  So you're kind of taking him out of his game if he has to just stand there stiff and not move.  Because, you know, the mic stand's going to creak.  I just don't want the home audience to think I'm some melodramatic idiot that walks you out of the mic stand,  you know, pacing like a panther.  So high energy.  That was cool when Chris Rock did it for the first time. 
[00:07:00]  Or didn't Pryor do some of that back in the day as well?  Well, you mean pacing back and forth?  No, David Brenner does it.  Pryor walked, but never uncomfortably fast.  Eddie Murphy did that in Delirious.  Eddie Murphy did it as well?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, it is getting old, though.  I mean, Chris Rock did it beautifully when he was doing his thing, you know?  Yeah.  But anyway, we're here.  Hey.  There's a bunch of things I want to get to right off the bat.  I was trying to remember.  You were saying something about that thing.  Oh, there was, well, our little evenings last night. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I guess we could start with that, sure.  You guys went out?  Well, we went to Georgetown.  And we ate at a fine Italian restaurant.  You did?  We knew it was going to be a good restaurant because right at the front door is a picture  of Bill Clinton and Hillary.  Oh, really?  That's where they went for Valentine's Day.  Both of them?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were just...  Like there's any romance in that marriage that they need to go out for Valentine's Day.  I guess it's his favorite restaurant here in Washington, D.C., in the Georgetown area. 
[00:08:00]  A fine Italian joint.  We had a really good meal.  Yeah.  We're hanging out, and all of a sudden the chancellor of Germany walks in, and the whole  place, like, stands up and applauds.  Really?  That was a little weird.  Yeah, except for us.  We had no idea who he was.  He looked like that fat guy from Lethal Weapon 2.  The South African guy.  Right, yeah.  That's exactly what he looked like.  Really?  We're just assuming he was the chancellor of Germany, because our waiter was telling  us that there's a special VIP area where...  Because we asked, you know... 
[00:08:30]  So why did you pick the chancellor of Germany for him to be?  Because they said...  The waiter said that the chancellor of Germany is here tonight.  Yeah, they said that he's here tonight.  Yeah.  But maybe he was already here, and this was another guy going to this VIP area.  Because we asked, we're like, where does Bill go when he comes to this restaurant?  Because he can't just sit out there with everybody.  All the schmucks like us.  The crap.  So there's, like, this back room right next to the kitchen that they go into.  I guess.  Ah.  Yeah.  So we're sitting there, and also this big, just enormous...  He looked like a raging alcoholic, to be honest with you. 
[00:09:00]  He looks like he's been to a few Oktoberfests in his day.  That's what the Europeans are, anyway.  And then his, like, security looked like we could have taken him.  He's a little weird guy with pistol balls in his right...  Really?  Yeah.  We were studying his bolts, trying to figure out what kind of weapon he had.  And he gave us the up and down, like, don't even think about it.  I talked to the chancellor.  I said, hello.  And he went, careful, lover.  I pardon you.  There's a ring around a restaurant. 
[00:09:30]  So we had dinner, and then it was Lindsay and I, it was Jimmy, it was Derek, it was  Martini Steve, and we all started shopping.  Shopping.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shopping.  Now, what could you shop for?  Well, Georgetown's awesome.  It's a lot of fun.  There's, you know, there's martini bars, there's nice restaurants.  Ooh, martini bars.  There's great shopping, there's Abercrombie and Fitch, and The Gap, and I mean, you name 
[00:10:00]  it, they have it there.  Yeah, whatever you want, man.  Nice shirts and clothes and soap and shoes.  Like, whatever you want to buy, there's plenty out there.  Yeah, why don't you back up?  No Rodeo Drive.  Exactly.  And you missed the key word there.  Yeah.  He's trying to get past this.  Soap.  Soap.  I like soap.  What's the name of the store we went into?  I don't know.  Lush.  Lush.  What?  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop it.  How would you even go into a store named Lush? 
[00:10:30]  We're walking by the store, and the loveliest scent hit me.  I was hit by a lovely scent.  Jimmy loves to shop.  He loves stuff like Pottery Barn and Bed Bath and Beyond.  He likes these, like, kind of girly stores.  Yeah.  They have a word for guys like that.  Pack it.  His whole demeanor changes, though.  We're walking by this store called Lush. 
[00:11:00]  Did he go, oh, that would have been more masculine?  It really would have been.  And all of a sudden he, I don't know, I guess you smelled the fragrances coming from the store?  It was an ensemble of fragrances.  Because we're on the sidewalk, the doors are open, and all of a sudden Jimmy goes, ooh, or whatever, and he just runs into the store.  A cornucopia of scents.  Yeah.  A cornucopia of scents.  So we walk into Lush, and Jimmy is just beyond excited. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  He wants to know about all the soaps.  Ah.  The place has got these handmade soaps, okay?  And it's, uh, it's, it's like, they look like just chunks of, like, clay.  But they're, they're just, they're.  You know what it is?  It's like, uh, cheese blocks.  Exactly what they look like, cheese blocks.  Like, big cheese block looking things of soap.  Yeah.  And then you smell one, and then you go, oh, I like that.  And then they.  Each one tickling the olfactory.  And they cut off a piece of the, uh, the soap for you. 
[00:12:00]  They cut it off and wrap it up all night.  Oh, look, he's got his soap.  What, this is, this here is called Bohemian Soap, specially crafted with luscious lemons to get you squeaky clean.  Oh.  Hey, Martini Steve.  It sure works great for getting male jizz out of your ass crack.  It would, it would have been more masculine to wash my face with a cock.  So, uh, you know, there's a lot of people.  We're all hanging out. 
[00:12:30]  Here comes Martini Steve with his bag.  He's got his lunch bag.  Oh, you bunch of fruits.  I'm not gay, but I like to be lemony fresh.  Oh.  I didn't pick the lemon one.  I got it.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't know.  What's it?  Is it?  Yeah, it's here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my.  Hold on.  Let me explain, though.  Because, yeah, there, Martini Steve has walked in with his bag from Lush.  Oh, they still smell.  So, so Jimmy's running around this joint thing.  It's the coolest thing he's ever seen.  They have stuff like bath bombs.  Bath bombs? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's like the size of a softball, and I guess you drop it in your bath water, and it's like  an Alka-Seltzer tablet.  Oh, and you get a little bubbling action there.  Wow.  Lavender.  They're all the scents you'd want for bath bombs.  Of course.  Then they have, like, face soaps with actual seaweed in them.  Really?  And they have soap for every type of skin problem that you might have.  Oh, dry skin or oily.  So, Jimmy, there's mostly women in this place, you know, working there and shopping there, 
[00:13:30]  and Jimmy just kind of takes over the whole joint.  He's got two or three people working for him.  You're asking questions.  All sorts of questions.  You're asking your soap questions?  What's good for this?  What's good for your pores?  Yeah, because I want to get a facial.  I've never gotten one.  You can get a facial, all right.  No, not the fun kind.  Hey, Bobby Bigrigger is very confused on the phones.  He says he likes urine and soap.  Both very, in a weird way, cleansing. 
[00:14:00]  You know, if you want to tease my tinkle enjoyment, that cleanses things, I think.  Uh-huh.  So, he's running around all excited.  And we're all just kind of standing around, taking a slight interest, Anthony.  Like, oh, that's a little interesting.  Oh, yeah, whatever, you know.  Next thing you know, we're all shopping.  You're all sucked into this whole thing.  He sucked us all in.  Picking up, this one is very good.  This is my favorite.  It's the Demon in the Dark soap.  It's called Demon in the Dark.  Of course it is.  It has a lovely, like, mint flavor scent, and it says, 
[00:14:30]  peel the wax, lather, and wait for your dark side to appear.  Oh.  Ooh, saucy.  This really is the type of soap you should be using on yourself as you open your robe  while you're standing there in the doorway thanking your friends for visiting again.  They have gentle on your sarcoma.  Wow.  Yeah, they have soap that looks like brownies and all sorts of crap, Anthony. 
[00:15:00]  It was quite amazing, and this bastard sucked us all in.  It's a great place, though.  You can't not buy soap when you're there.  You have to.  They're all different shapes and sizes.  Anthony, ready?  Jimmy, how much did you spend on your soap yesterday?  A few dollars, I think.  How much?  A few bucks.  This bar was $11 for this bar.  $11 for that.  Well, you have to realize, this is sandstone soap.  Follow the Brazilians and keep your body smooth with sand soap.  Yours only cost $11?  Yeah, well, what kind of a hunk did you get? 
[00:15:30]  I got this for $16.  I didn't even realize.  That is a $16 bar of soap.  They weigh it.  Yeah.  Is that what they do?  Of course.  You've got to be shitting me.  I'm paying for it.  You'll lather with it.  Oh, you got the same one, Steve.  Yeah, yeah.  I sensed you.  Jesus.  I was told not to get the sandstone soap.  By who?  It's exfoliating, I bet.  Well, that's what I was looking for in one of those soaps for my face.  And, like, you don't want the sandstone.  It'll just rip you apart.  That's for, like, your feet, Anthony.  You know how it gets all calloused in the middle of summer? 
[00:16:00]  What's that?  You've got that rough skin, and it's all peely.  Oh.  So you use that on the bottom of your feet.  Rockstar soap.  Is that what that's for?  For your feet?  No, this is the sandstone soap.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Don't use that on your face.  I'm going to.  No, they say not to use that on your face.  Maybe gently.  But no.  Slow, circular motions with just your fingertips.  Dude, it's actual sand.  Fruit.  It's actual sand.  Look at this dispenser.  It has a helmet on it, and you squeeze the bottom two things. 
[00:16:30]  But it says, aim for back.  But Jimmy's the worst.  He's the worst.  Because he sucks everybody in.  Yeah.  And then next thing you know, everyone's pulling out their credit cards,  walking out of the store with their little Lush bag.  The Lush bag.  You can't help it.  It was just fun stuff.  And then we're walking around Georgetown trying to look cool,  and you can't look cool with a Lush bag.  No, you can't.  Is that the receipt, Jimmy?  Yeah.  How much total?  It's not the whole receipt, actually.  It's something else.  What was the total that you spent on soap last night?  I don't know. 
[00:17:00]  Wait.  No.  The bottom number, Jim.  No, but you see there's a bunch of numbers.  I spent, it's more than that.  Oh, boy.  He's, I know about how much he's spent.  Not that much.  Less than $40.  No.  No, you couldn't have gotten out of there for less than $40.  I got a few of these.  This cold face was $12.46 for this little bar.  What does that do?  Black soap for clear skin with charcoal, licorice, and soothing oils.  I got one of those, too, Anthony.  Of course you did. 
[00:17:30]  I got one of those, and then I got some body wash, some shower gel, a lemon-lime mixture,  and some kind of mint mixture.  These are just good.  You feel like you're just standing there with, like, a bar of quarry soap, just washing your...  It has a heavy weight to them, man.  What's wrong with, I don't know, ivory?  Nothing.  A bar of ivory in your shower, and Steve, what other soaps did you buy?  I got, I just got...  Ivory is good for common people, and those little people that like that, that's fine, 
[00:18:00]  but, again, I'm a fancy person.  Soap diva.  This is what happens when you hit the road, though.  You get bored, and you start doing things you would never do at home.  Shopping for soap.  I would never go shopping for soap in New York City.  In retrospect, I have a piece of the sandstone that Jimmy got, and then I got rock star soap,  which is, it's not as overwhelming.  The one thing you realize is when you walk into these places, the smells are so overpowering.  You get pulled in different directions, and you don't really know which one. 
[00:18:30]  Good point, Steve.  And you just, I went for the least offending one of the group.  This was like candy or gum or some of the...  It does.  You're a rock star.  That's all you got, Steve?  Yeah, but these two pieces of soap cost 24 bucks.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a lot.  It must have been late.  I guess the cock store was closed.  I figured you'd just...  I don't know what time that closes, but...  It's, uh...  It's, uh...  I know I spent about, uh, $60 in there. 
[00:19:00]  $60?  Yeah.  On soap?  On soap.  Wow.  It's not just soap.  It's not.  It's a fun showering and bathing experience.  I should have bought a bathing...  A ball bomb.  A bathing bomb.  A bath bomb.  Yeah, bath bomb.  Yeah.  Are you going to, uh...  Are you going to, like, maybe display these in a basket in your new bathroom?  No, no, they don't.  They look like, like you said, like a cheese, but it's like big hunks of, like, cheese.  So, no, I'll just use them.  You'll just use them?  You could kill somebody with this, uh, soap.  Yeah, they seem very...  It's very heavy and very brick-like. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, very chalky-looking softball-type thing.  What do you say?  Give me two pounds of that and...  No, they're in, like, like, imagine, like, a fruit basket, like, arrangement, but it was...  Good analogy.  Yeah, I can imagine that.  Like, I like a fruit stand, but instead of fruits, there's soaps.  Just imagine a basket filled with a drug cocktail.  How awful is this, Anthony?  Oh, it's horrid.  But he sucked us all in, because at first, we're just standing around like,  Oh, God, how long is he going to be in there? 
[00:20:00]  And we're actually out on the sidewalk, kind of checking out the sights and stuff,  and slowly but shortly, we all started walking in.  You all started walking in and purchasing your soaps.  You can't help it.  It's phenomenal.  The bath balls were great.  I'm moving into this place next week, and my tub is really deep.  I should have got a bath ball, so I could have taken a nice lavender bath.  Lavender bubbly bath, but I didn't.  No, you should have.  What else did you buy, Jimmy?  That was it?  That was just...  I think most of the soaps is all I got.  And they gave me a couple of samples, like, you know, little creams and such.  Weren't you going to buy the face soap cream crap that has the seaweed? 
[00:20:30]  The actual seaweed?  Yeah, I actually got talked out of that, because it smelled bad.  Yeah, it had, like, actual seaweed in it.  And a seaweed would probably smell bad.  Yeah, I decided not to get that.  I traded it for some sandstone.  It's called Lady's Snatch.  Let's go to Seabass.  Seabass!  How you doing, fellas?  Hey.  Hi, Seabass.  I want to know if the Lush bag has a picture of two fellas lathering each other up on it.  I don't know. 
[00:21:00]  Lathering each other up.  You're not dying, sonny.  You're soaping everyone around you.  Let's say hi to Rob.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Just want to know why Steve didn't get the flaming soap.  What did they have?  Flaming soap?  I didn't see any.  If there was, I missed it.  That would have been a coup.  Steve bought soap.  It smells like an olive.  Let's go to Tim in Jersey.  Hey, Tim.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, Sugarman.  Hi.  Hi, mister.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[00:21:30]  Did you ask the girls when they were helping you around if they had any soaps that were designed  to help remove the scent of logs from the chest?  No, sir.  I kind of kept that under my hat.  I just asked.  I kind of hinted around.  Look, I have a son, and his diapers are always full.  Is this good?  Let's see what's...  Can I soap up your ass?

[00:22:00]  And you rub and go, como, como, washo, como, como.  Why is it only Jimmy and Steve? 
[00:22:30]  I hope he bought $60.  She surely did.  Because it's the Brazilian soap.  I hope he didn't get that.  No, I went with the shower gel.  I guess that was the expensive.  I don't know.  Shower gel?  Yeah.  What else did you get?  It was a lemon-lime shower gel.  Ooh.  Some kind of mint shower gel.  Minty fresh.  And that black soap.  Oh, that's the coal stuff for your face.  Coal.  Yeah, it's your coal soap for exfoliation.  They come out singing Mammy. 
[00:23:00]  Black coal soap for your face.  Yeah.  And then they had, like, soap, shampoo.  What the hell was that about?  Oh, these were actually lovely.  I was going to buy one.  Lovely.  Lovely.  Our show should never be using the word lovely.  Lovely.  Yeah, these things were cool, man.  These soaps were fucking...  Reminded me of tits, you know?  Yeah, that's it.  Big soap tits.  I wanted to buy these ones, but I didn't...  They were shampooed.  They looked like those little round, again, like smaller cheese things, but these were  whole circles. 
[00:23:30]  Uh-huh.  Like a picture of a donut.  A whole, you know, solid donut.  Right.  And they smelled great, but they were shampooed.  And I guess you would just rub them into your hair.  Rub it into your hair like a...  Yeah, like a little hair bar.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That is lovely.  Yeah, it is.  Nice shampooing experience.  But I don't really need that, so I didn't buy it.  And we all walked out with our lush bags.  We sure did.  A bunch of men just walking, smelling good.  With your lush bags.  Yeah.  Thumbs up in other people.  Did you shop anywhere else, or that was your only shopping experience? 
[00:24:00]  I ran at the Pottery Barn quickly.  I wanted to get a...  Dude, I wanted to...  I'm sorry.  I wanted to use some of my new soap last night, but they don't sell soap dishes in this place  that you can travel with, so I am not going to use...  Oh, jeez.  A traveling soap dish.  Well, you know, like the one that you take your block of soap in.  There's no way to wash, and then put your wet soap back in your bag.  It's going to get stuff all over.  So you would want a little case, perhaps like Howard Hughes used in the Aviator?  I almost got that last night, but I didn't, by the way.  He opens it up.  Every time he goes into the bathroom, Howard Hughes would open up this little silver case 
[00:24:30]  and pull his soap out and just wash until his hands bled.  Would he really?  Yeah.  Pop it back in and hold his breath when people with polio pass by him so he wouldn't breathe  in the air that they were giving off.  Are we talking about Howard Hughes or me?  Or you, Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, a little crazy like that.  Howard Hughes would close that thing up and put it back in the glove compartment of his Escalade.  Exactly.  You can't be too careful.  And I don't think you can wash your hands to the point of making them bleed, by the way. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, I think you can.  How?  You just wash them and wash them, and all the oils wash away.  They crack.  Yeah?  Yeah, I've heard of that.  You heard of that, Anthony?  I've heard of that.  All right, let's go to Don.  I never saw it.  Look, my hands are very smooth.  Let's go to Don and get out of here.  You've got money all your life.  You've got city hands, Mr. Hooper.  Tiniest sheep shank.  Get that lush soap.  You're going to need a bigger soap bag.  Let's drink to your sandstone. 
[00:25:30]  So, I need a soap dish once.  Swallowed it whole.  Eyes rolled back white.  Bubbles coming out of his mouth.  I'll never go into lush again.  Hey, let's go to Don in Connecticut.  Hey, Don.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  This is horrible.  You know, you guys are, Anthony, you've got to fill up the pillowcase and just beat these  guys with it.  Which is so.  There you go.  Ow! 
[00:26:00]  Ow!  It's just funny how it goes down, though, because it always starts with Jim.  Ow!  That smells good.  Remember, fat boy?  It's just a beautiful...  Ow!  I was trying to say beautiful and odoriferous in the same sentence.  That's a tough one to pull off.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  Ow!  Ow!  That's lovely!  Ow!  Ow!  Oh, God.  Beaten with the soap as it walks up into your nose.  Hmm. 
[00:26:30]  That's the problem with going on the road, though.  You find these little things to occupy your time and entertain yourself, I guess.  Yeah.  Because every city has the same stores, The Gap and, you know, Abercrombie and Pitch  and...  Yeah, baggy stores.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  And then you see an unusual store like this and you have to take a peek because you're  kind of bored out there and the next thing you know, you're spending a lot of money.  I don't think I'll ever...  I don't even think I'll use the stuff I bought.  Someone is asking if you took a sliver off the big block named Shit Dick.  Dude, I remember one time I was in Baltimore and I was doing the Baltimore Improv and I actually 
[00:27:00]  went shopping one day in Baltimore.  And I was bored talking to Evita because the hotel had Evita in it and I had never smelled  that kind of stuff.  Oh, Evita.  Yeah.  And what do they sell?  The same type of lovely, you know, like little shampoos and like little things for your hands.  Lotions.  I spent almost $200 in Evita.  Oh, my goodness.  And it sat in a bag on my counter for a year and a half.  I never used it.  I do that.  A year and a half.  I'm compulsive.  I don't shop to the point of spending thousands of dollars. 
[00:27:30]  Like, I'll go out and just do something stupid like that and then just never use it and go,  oh, you really are a faggot.  And I don't, you know.  I can see you using your soaps, though.  Yeah.  Why not?  I'm hygienic.  Then we went to Barnes & Noble and we're all buying books.  Relatively normal books.  Yeah.  No big deal.  I bought the latest book from the Fight Club author.  I can never say his last name.  Uh-huh.  Was this one, what, 30, 35 pages?  Fight Club was a little thin.  Oh, no, no.  It's longer than that.  And Jimmy finally goes to the checkout counter with his chess books. 
[00:28:00]  Oh.  I bought a couple, yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Look, intellectual.  Chess problems and the one about chess players and then confederacy dunces.  I just wanted to buy some books.  I know, but the chess books.  I was just browsing through really fast while he was online.  I'm like, you're actually going to read this stuff?  I love them.  I'm weird with chess books.  I'll buy a bunch of them and I know I'll never really go through them.  Yeah.  They're great in the toilet and they're just kind of like, when I can finally break away  from my stupid computer, my porn sites, I can actually just play out the moves from  the book, which I love killing. 
[00:28:30]  You just sit there reading.  Oh, chess.  But they're actual chess problems and then you've got to what?  Try to solve what's happening?  Yeah.  And I'll probably solve one out of 50.  Oh, he castles here.  Makes perfect sense.  As opposed to going out and banging a girl.  I guess.  I can just picture him in a lathery bathtub with candles.  Oh, candles all lit around him.  And then reading his chess problems.  Holding his chess book out of the water.  Yes.  That's fantastic.  That's right.  Just playing a little chess and bad-mouthing the Jews. 
[00:29:00]  Like, you know, Bobby F.  That's sociopath.  Bobby F.  You guys see, Fisher interviewed him because Iceland and Reykjavik, they finally gave him  like a, you know, some kind of a place to live now.  They gave him citizenship in Iceland.  And then he's just, he's had a press conference recently.  He's like, you know, the fucking Jews, man.  He's hate.  Oh, yeah.  He really does not like the Jews.  And he's half Jewish.  Yeah.  His mother's Jewish.  God.  But it was very interesting in Georgetown last night, Anthony.  It was fun.  We kind of missed you out there.  You know, I got the call. 
[00:29:30]  You guys were all going out.  And for a second, it sounded good.  But then I just pictured, you know, the walk through the stores.  I pictured the whole thing.  I knew there would be shopping and stuff.  And I was just kind of like, eh.  You know, I had my own faggy thing to do last night.  American Idol was on.  I wanted to make sure I caught it.  And by caught it, I mean AIDS.  So I figured I'd do my own fag thing back in my room. 
[00:30:00]  And me and my chick hung out in the room.  Watched Deep Throat.  Did you really?  It was available on the Spanked Revision.  I haven't seen that movie in God knows how long.  I realized I had never seen it.  Really?  You know, and they said it's the movie that everybody's heard about.  But usually you haven't seen it, you know.  Not a lot of people have seen it.  So I rented that one.  And it was just god-awful.  Right.  1972. 
[00:30:30]  Just bad 70s porno.  The bad camera work.  Like, you look now and you realize how good they've gotten at filming people fucking.  Yeah.  It's just, it's a science.  They get the camera in there.  It's not a problem to zoom in right there on the vitals as they're going at it.  This one, the camera would try to, it was so far back and there's so much 70s hair.  Just a bush and the guy is just covered in hair that it darkens the whole picture. 
[00:31:00]  So you can't even see the point of contact where they're having sex.  And they try to zoom in.  It gets all blurry.  And there's pubes on the lens.  You're seeing pubes like stuck on the camera lens.  Bad, like, almost technicolor looking.  Just horrid.  70s mustaches.  The 70s porno mustaches.  Linda Lovelace was shaved, which was odd. 
[00:31:30]  I didn't think anyone's shaved back then.  Yeah, I can't imagine looking at a hairy bush.  Oh.  You see some of these old pornos and it's just like, ugh.  Dude, the opening scene is this nasty old broad.  She's spread eagle.  Sitting on a table.  How old?  I don't know.  She looked like she was in her 50s.  Wow.  For a porno, that's old.  And she's got her legs up and some guy's going down on her.  Big pork chop sideburns and like an afro. 
[00:32:00]  And he's going down on her.  And she's got this bad lipstick on.  And she goes, you mind if I smoke?  And she lights up a cigarette and she's just puffing.  She almost had like a Joan Collins look to her.  No, not in a good way.  Just in an old way.  And just a big, nasty bush.  It was the most unsexy scene ever.  Ever. 
[00:32:30]  And then it got kind of funny when Harry Reams comes in.  Because he's, you know, what a comic genius he is.  Doing little character things.  Was he?  Yeah, and then Linda Lovelace goes down on him.  We've got to get some clips from Deep Throat.  Because it's...  And when they're having sex, most of what you're seeing are face shots.  They show like, you know, Linda Lovelace's face shot or Harry Reams' face shot.  No sound.  It's all bad 70s music.  Like made for the movie.  These bad 70s bands come in and just record this bad porno music. 
[00:33:00]  Awful.  Yeah, I figured I had to see it.  But that was what I did.  It's what I do now.  It's an important movie because of what it set off.  Like, what's that movie, History of America or something like that that was very controversial racially?  No one knows.  It was...  Black and white?  No, it was black and white, yeah.  Yeah?  Like way back in the day?  Yeah.  Really?  I sort of know what you're talking about.  You know which one? 
[00:33:30]  There's a big controversy about the...  Oh, man.  You mean like one of the first films ever made?  Yes, there's a History of America or something like that or something about history where  the Klan was portrayed as being good and like wholesome Americans or something.  I did...  Damn it, now I got a mental block.  It's a bad movie, but I mean it's an important movie because of like what it set in motion  as far as, you know, just the genre.  Yeah.  I hope I can remember the name.  It's a great movie.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break, Anthony?  Comedy, isn't it?  That was one of the funniest jokes. 
[00:34:00]  My friend Jordan Rubin, who now is like the head comedy booker for Carson Daly, wrote  a joke years ago.  He said, yeah, I went to Germany and I went to rent a movie.  I was looking for Schindler's List, but I couldn't find it because it was in the Slapstick  Comedy Section.  The Slapstick.  My God.  Jordan was funny.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  When we get back, we're going to talk about American Idol, obviously.  Anthony, Birth of a Nation.  Birth of a Nation.  Yes, Birth of a Nation.  We'll talk about American Idol when we get back.  Ooh. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  I watched it.  Ooh, you did.  Just that part.  Lathering up?  No, I was not lathering up.  Two friggin' hours, American Idol.  Dude, I turned it in five minutes before they announced it because I'm online with somebody.  That's all you need.  She's like, hey, American Idol, they're going to announce the winner.  I'm like, all right.  When I got back.  Drag back all the bad people that they'd thrown off the show during the season and let  them get up and sing.  I wasn't going to get rooked in.  I got back to the hotel.  Did you lather up?  I didn't lather up.  I took a peek at American Idol, and then all of a sudden I'm like, wait a minute. 
[00:35:00]  It's only 8.30.  I'm not getting suckered into sitting here for an hour and a half.  Well, they're brilliant, though.  They make it sound like they're going to announce the winner any second.  Yeah.  And coming up.  Coming up.  And I'm like, oh, I know what they're up to.  Yeah.  So I bailed on American Idol.  And I told you guys who was going to win from day one.  So let's all calm down and relax.  I only saw the first two shows, and I said she was going to win. 
[00:35:30]  I thought she was great.  I've been saying it for about a month and a half now.  I don't know.  I don't think she should have.  No?  Well, we'll get into it next with Anthony, because he saw the whole show.  And also, right after the break, it's Dee Dee.  Oh.  Back from her spanking from yesterday, yes.  And there's a lady on the line, Becky, the trucker, hates her.  Why?  Wait.  Oh, she brought in her sex toys, too.  Oh.  Very, very good.  She brought in a clear plastic baggie. 
[00:36:00]  Very sexy carrying case.  Right, a bag.  All right, live from Washington, D.C., it's your pals, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  And we'll continue in just a bit.  Hey, what's that?  Well, you've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it. 
[00:36:30]  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the  centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  It's the fucking rock, you dildo.  All right, listen to me, shut up. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, it's clean.  I clean it with alcohol.  Everyone is...  Everyone is studying, uh, Dee Dee's sex toys.  She brought her toys in? 
[00:37:30]  Some.  Some?  Wow, I got more.  Well, yeah.  The whole bag over there.  All right, hold on.  We gotta go to the phone really fast here.  Say hi to Mark in Oklahoma City.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hello.  Those two deuce bags a couple weeks ago, Lex and Terry, they were doing that soundboard  thing that was all fucked up with the Rosie O'Donnell clips.  Oh, yeah.  We remember them.  They're gonna do it again today, but goddammit, I just ran out of their signal.  I was going through Tulsa, and they're on in Tulsa, so maybe another listener can call 
[00:38:00]  you guys with it.  All right, well, we like, uh, these, uh, wacky radio bits, so.  Okay.  Maybe someone else will call in with that.  There's an echo on his phone.  There he goes.  Yeah, I heard that.  A little odd.  Dee Dee is in the studio, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Good morning.  Morning.  We're gonna, we're gonna start by talking about, uh, American Idol.  Mm-hmm.  Wow, you're really upset.  Oh, well, Bo didn't win, so yeah, Carrie won.  She's a little upset. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Well, America voted, Opie, and, uh, they chose Carrie.  She was the favorite, and, um, a lot of people, uh, thought she'd win, and she did.  Unfortunately.  Uh, I, I thought she was, she's a little bland.  I think she's very, pretty one-dimensional.  Uh, she sings country, and that's about it.  So you're gonna get an American Idol country singer.  She's a little bit country, and he was a little bit, a little bit rock and rock.  They even played that song.  I was cracking up the Donnie Marie song.  Oh. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, I thought he had a little more versatility to him.  Yeah.  I think, uh, having a, uh, Cokehead as an American Idol would have been fun.  You know?  Recovering Cokehead.  Oh, stop.  The arrests that would have been coming.  They, they showed, uh, they, they went, they went to his hometown, I guess, with a big arena  packed with people, and they showed a couple of his friends, and you just knew there, there's,  you just know there's trouble in that guy's future.  It was just the typical mullet-headed drunks that, like, go out and just get arrested, uh, 
[00:39:30]  every weekend.  Oh, it's Alabama.  That would have been fun.  It's Alabama.  What else is there to do?  And yeah, I mean, he was brought up on, um, cocaine charges, which were reduced to something  else.  Uh, he, he, plea bargained it down, but, um, I don't know.  I, I, he still looks like the type of guy that enjoys his cocaine, so I think that would  have been a little fun instead of the wholesome carry in there.  Uh, but, uh, what are you going to do?  She won, so now you get this country singer kind of, uh, boring American Idol. 
[00:40:00]  But you know David Hasselhoff was on last night.  Oh my God.  You like David Hasselhoff?  No, but he was, he, I guess he has nothing better going, so he showed up there.  Yeah.  What they did last night, because it's a two-hour show.  It doesn't take two hours to say, and the winner is.  So they fill the show with, uh, a long duo.  Yeah.  It's like recaps of, of some of the goofy people that auditioned and, and things like  that.  And one of the segments, uh, was two guys that had auditioned and just were miserable, 
[00:40:30]  but they turned out to be, like, buddies.  They're typical, like, Star Wars geek types.  Oh, I remember that from the audition, uh, shows.  Two guys, and they made, like, almost a love story looking thing between these two.  I remember that.  They were there live, uh, last night.  Uh, they get up and wave to the crowd, and they're all applauding, and, and, um, Ryan  Seacrest says, see that empty seat next to you?  One kid was a huge David Hasselhoff fan.  And he's like, yeah.  He goes, well, uh, I hope you don't mind. 
[00:41:00]  And we have somebody that's going to sit there, uh, for the show.  And out comes David Hasselhoff.  That's awful.  To which this fat kid was almost crying.  He hugged him.  He hugged him, and his eyes welled up, and he couldn't believe that David Hasselhoff was  there.  And all I could think, was, was David Hasselhoff, did he have to sit there the whole show next  to this freak?  They didn't, you know, they didn't even cam in, so maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe, because all I can imagine is, you know, I, believe me, it takes a lot to, to, for  me to get any sympathy for David Hasselhoff, but all I was thinking is this poor bastard 
[00:41:30]  has now got to sit there with this guy like, David, I love the episode of Baywatch, when,  oh, God, you just want to punch him.  Fat kid with sour milk breath.  Oh, yeah.  That white stuff in the corner of his lips, all anxious and frightened.  David.  David.  David.  That's funny.  Did you sign this?  Yeah.  Too bad we missed that.  We were too busy shopping for soap.  Shopping for soap, of course.  Jesus.  Smelling the lovely scents. 
[00:42:00]  You're buying soap.  You're watching David Hasselhoff.  That's just a collection of mows this show is.  Faulting.  Let's go to some clubs real fast here, Anthony.  All right.  The winner of American Idol 2005 is...  Carrie Underwood!  Oh, listen to that.  How are the ratings for the show?  Huge.  Good as ever?  I think so. 
[00:42:30]  Still doing very well, that show, American Idol.  Yeah, she won, and she, of course, starts crying, and then they make her try to sing, which is...  She did okay at the end.  She lost it.  Really?  She's trying to sing, and she just lost it.  She starts crying.  Do we have a clip of that?  That would be funny.  I think we do.  And I want to be inside you, heaven.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, Mr. McClick.  That's good.  I want to be inside your vagina. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, no.  Where the storm blows your way.  Good work.  Did she crack on that first note?  She was crying.  She was crying.  She was... 
[00:43:30]  Weren't you?  She was singing.  No.  She was kind of doing okay.  And then she kind of fell out of it, a little crying.  Right in the beginning here.  Listen again.  And I want to be inside you, heaven.  Thank you so much.  Take me to the place.  Thank you so much.  That could be the best line in the morning, though.  I want to be inside your vagina.  She is a hot piece of ass, though, man.  What is that?  She won by only 200 votes? 
[00:44:00]  Really?  Okay.  Recount.  Really?  Wait, did you say she won by only 200 votes, and then it says 35,426 votes?  That's what she had.  Only 35,000 votes?  No, there's millions.  They got a half a billion calls.  Yeah, they got a half a billion votes over the entire course of the contest.  They said it was only 200 votes between the two of them.  Out of a half billion?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, that was a half billion over the entire course of the program, I think.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  I got to hear they got more than 35,000 votes each.  Yeah.  Where are you getting your stats, Don?  Off of Fox News?  Really?  Thank you, America!  Thank you, America.  What is this?  Is this Bo?  Yeah, Bo.  That is Bo singing with Leonard Skinner.  Really?  Yeah.  They brought Leonard Skinner up, and Bo was singing with Leonard Skinner. 
[00:45:00]  That's Bo sang it?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, he was good.  Freedom, Alabama.  Oh, sweet of all.  Oh, I'm coming on the go-ins.  If I'm in here, I'm with him in the go-and-out.  And we all did what we could do.  Look, I didn't watch the show. 
[00:45:30]  Pretty good.  It's obvious that he has a much better voice.  Yeah, he, he, uh, it was just more dynamic.  The guy's more, uh, he's, he's, uh, I don't know, he's more of a showman than she is.  She just, everything she did was stand in front of the mic, hold the mic, maybe slowly walk on the stage and sing a country song.  Well, it makes a better story that the small-town girl wins it all, right?  Because she's from a tiny, tiny little farm town, I remember, from the first couple of episodes.  Yeah.  He's from friggin' Alabama. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, but I mean, but it sounds like he has a little more experience, though.  Yeah, definitely does.  She seemed like they just picked her out of nowhere, and that, that makes for the nice little, little story.  Maybe that's it.  But either way, I mean, like, he's made, too.  I mean, when you think of Ruben or Clay Aiken, I mean, they're both huge stars now.  I mean, it's like, either one of them has a signal, a signal.  Oh, he'll get a record deal.  Yeah, but Clive Davis likes him.  Done.  Oh?  Clive Davis.  Who's that?  I know that name.  It took me a while to realize that he actually did say my name. 
[00:46:30]  And then I thought, oh man, I gotta sing now.  But I was just, there were so many emotions that were going through me, you know.  I was nervous, and I was excited, and I was scared, and I mean, it was just an amazing feeling.  Well, there you go.  Oh, she's nice.  I liked her, too, so I can't complain.  Oh, she's perfect for American Idol.  She's like the blonde, all-American kind of thing.  She's sweet.  She's, you know, that's what they want to put up there.  She's pretty.  I like the coke head.  I like the coke head, too.  I think the coke addict would have made a fun American Idol, because you know it just would have been all over the smokinggun.com. 
[00:47:00]  Every week, of how this guy's just banging, doing coke, killing people, killing his drunk friends in a car.  Oh, we're going to get to that.  We got a story.  What?  If you don't have that story, you're not going to be our newswoman.  She has it.  I have faith indeed.  You have it.  You better find the story of the day.  Not a single bit of disappointment.  I think that Carrie Underwood was the perfect person to win this.  I think she earned it.  I think she did a great job.  I'm extremely proud of her, and I know that every one of the other idols feel the exact same way I do. 
[00:47:30]  I hate that.  Want to do a toot?  Go in the bathroom and do a toot?  She did a great job.  Yeah.  Grinding his teeth.  Yeah, she's cool, man.  She's really good.  Why can't he just say on national TV how bummed he is, and he thought he should have won,  and he knows he's better than her?  I think everybody knew at the end.  I think he kind of blew it, too.  What was it?  The night before last, when they had their last chance. 
[00:48:00]  Well, she wasn't that good either, though.  No, but I think he was even worse.  Was he bad?  I think the nerves.  He was doing great the whole season, and then I guess the nerves got to him,  and he kind of wasn't as good as he had been.  You're saying he misstepped a bit.  It's just a tad.  Perhaps he should have taken a hot bath with some soaps from Lush.  I think maybe what you're referring to is a bath bomb.  A bath bomb?  Yeah.  Get the terminology right, Anthony.  Your candles?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  American Idol.  That was really exciting. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Bravo for that.  It was.  It was.  Opiac.  You enjoyed the show, Anthony.  Contrary to your opinion, perhaps, I think a lot of people seem to watch that program.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I guess you're right.  It's not like I'm watching something on the Oxygen channel.  Well, yeah.  Let's go to CJ in Alabama.  Oh.  CJ, what's going on?  Hi, CJ.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, last night.  I live in Helena, so we were all up at Inca Hoots, the local bar, restaurant, place, and 
[00:49:00]  they're all like, everybody's drunk, and we're all watching suspense, and then they call out  Carrie Underwood, and everyone just starts crying and booing, and it was just ridiculous.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Well, is he still here?  Yeah.  Shut up, Jim.  Dude, what kind of bar was it?  No, no, no, Jim.  Jim.  Stop.  Dude.  Jim.  Well, I wonder what kind of bar it was. 
[00:49:30]  Why were they crying?  It's a southern bar.  It was a really cool bar.  All right.  I know.  Why were they sad, though?  Oh, he's gone.  He's gone, Jimmy.  Oh, I hate you.  Rick and Staten Island.  Anthony, were you watching it last night?  Of course I was.  I was wondering if you saw when Carrie looked at Bo and said, I love you, and she was hanging  all over him.  Maybe they have a thing going.  Yeah.  Oh, that would be a little nice storyline there, huh?  Oh.  Hey, punch out.  Thank you. 
[00:50:00]  Two idols.  Hook up.  Wait, we're just saying no.  Like the first season.  You don't think they're in love?  Yeah.  He's obviously got the facts right.  I heard that she got 18 votes and he got 37.  No, no, no.  I'm sure I tried.  Why don't you think they have a thing going?  Could have.  I thought she had something going on with Fedorov, the guy who was it.  No way.  The week before?  Anthony Fedorov.  That guy?  I thought he was.  He is the worst.  He was.  No.  Him?  No.  Just the worst.  Did you hear when they brought him up and who else did they have for their little? 
[00:50:30]  They had every, like, all the top ten, right?  Him singing with Constantine, singing with Kenny Wayne Shepard, who came on.  And it was just a clusterfuck.  Oh, it was awful.  All right.  That's it.  American Idol.  Done for another season.  Can't wait till next season.  All right, Dee Dee, what else is going on in the news here? 
[00:51:00]  How about more Bush in 2008?  Oh, ha.  Bush.  Bush.  Bush.  That's funny, because I think she means the president, but, you know, you say more Bush,  and we think, oh, well, who would be against more Bush?  Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, some are beginning to suspect that First Lady Laura Bush might be eyeing a possible  run for the top spot in 2008.  Oh, stop.  I'm serious. 
[00:51:30]  Stop it.  These dumb stories that come out every year.  Please.  Well, you know, in this term, she has begun to make more high-profile trips to the world, hot spots as well.  She made one trip.  No, she's done a few.  And, you know, she's becoming more outspoken with the national media.  So, yeah.  Who's saying that she might run for the presidency?  The brilliant political mastermind, Michael Savage.  Michael Savage.  What a hack.  Well, that's what he's saying.  I'm just reading it there. 
[00:52:00]  That's ridiculous.  Let's not even acknowledge she said that.  Okay.  She's not going to be president of the United States.  No one's voting for her.  You sort of have to be qualified.  First lady.  You sort of have to be qualified.  Being married to the president isn't.  Exactly.  Okay.  Well, how about...  I mean, Hillary doesn't even have a shot.  No.  No.  No.  Which means the Democrats are going to be out of office for another four years.  Who do you think will be in? 
[00:52:30]  Ugh.  That dude.  Can't be Cheney.  No.  It won't be Cheney.  Usually the incumbent vice president, especially after two runs of a president, usually he's  the guy, the go-to guy for the party.  But, you know, his health problems and age, and I don't think he's a very likable guy.  So the Republicans are going to have to come up with somebody.  All right.  What else you got there, DeeDee?  Well, Rob Lowe arrested for something involving a 13-year-old girl.  What?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  In Coos Bay, Oregon.  He's in Coos County Jail.  Coos.  Following a sex abuse investigation involving a 13-year-old girl.  Coos Bay, Oregon police officers arrested 24-year-old Robert S. Lowe.  Not the Lowe.  Oh.  Oh, you're tricking me.  I forgive you.  I'm teasing you.  You're in New Stinks.  I'm teasing you.  Well, he was arrested Tuesday on allegations of sexual contact with a minor.  This is the tricky news. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, well.  You tricked us.  I thought it was Rob Lowe.  Wow.  It was Robert S. Lowe.  It was Robert S. Lowe.  It was 24-year-old Robert S. Lowe.  24.  Coos Bay, Oregon.  That's all right, honey.  Coos.  I know.  That's what I was laughing at.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, how about British men top sex endurance, Paul?  Really?  Yeah.  Why women hate going Dutch?  Here, it's why.  International Survey in the Journal of Sex Medicine names British men as the sexual endurance champions of the world. 
[00:54:00]  An average British man makes love for 7.6 minutes, while the American men come in second at 7 minutes.  And the Spanish men come in at 5.8 minutes, and the Dutch are going at 5.1.  And if you're a Turkish man, well, you can take pride in the fact that you're the most efficient lovemakers at 3.7 minutes.  3.7 minutes for the Turks.  They only last 3.7 minutes, the Turks?  I feel bad for the Turkish men. 
[00:54:30]  That's all they can take, the smell off their women.  Ew.  Or three minutes.  They just want out of there.  They just want out of there as fast as possible.  Please, I must leave.  Right.  That's so bad.  Awful.  I was...  Thatched roof down there.  Right.  So, do you want me to show you what's in the bag?  Wow.  Oh, that was it for your news?  Well, for now, my producer's working on more news.  Give me a hint about what your news story is that I should have so I can tell my producer.  Well, before we get to what's in your bag of tricks there, Anthony came up with a great story. 
[00:55:00]  What?  This is from Marietta, Georgia.  A guy who was sentenced to five years in prison on Wednesday for a little accident that he had that took the life of his drinking buddy.  Cool.  They were out drinking.  This guy, John Hutcherson, 21, pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide in the death of last August of his friend Frankie Brome, who was 23 years old. 
[00:55:30]  It seems they're driving home after a night at the bar, which I guess you do a lot down there in Georgia.  You do a little drinking, you're driving home.  And I guess Frankie was feeling a little ill, so being a courteous friend, he hung his head out the window to vomit.  Now, who hasn't done that?  Who hasn't puked out your friend's car?  We pretty much all have done that.  Your friend's driving home, you've had a little too much, and you need to puke, so you just roll down the window, stick your head out, and take care of business.  Usually, no harm. 
[00:56:00]  Without incident, the only thing that happens may be a little puke down the fender.  Yeah.  Down the quarter panel.  Down the side of the car, and then your friend calls you the next morning, really pissed off, come over here and hose down your fucking puke.  And that's because, usually, your friend doesn't veer a little too close to a telephone pole support cable as your head is out the window vomiting.  Oh.  So Frankie, his buddy Frankie's head was completely removed. 
[00:56:30]  God.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Cut his head, clean off, decapitated his buddy.  But it doesn't end there, folks.  No, of course not.  This guy, John Hutcherson, is so drunk, he doesn't even notice he's just decapitated his buddy.  He pulls up to his house ten miles away.  He drove ten more miles with his buddy's decapitated body in the car.  Must have been a real conversationalist, this buddy is. 
[00:57:00]  What a self-involved ass.  Too busy trying to find a good song on the radio on the way home.  Dude, do you mind this?  All right, cool.  No, okay.  I guess not.  Listen to the words.  So he parks in the driveway, goes in and passes out, goes to sleep.  And the guy's still in the car.  The guy is still in the car with his shoulders and body kind of hanging out the window to  which the next door neighbor walks out, looks over and sees his decapitated body hanging out the window and calls police and they arrested him. 
[00:57:30]  But he got to have five years, five years in prison.  He got on Wednesday.  That is drunk.  Wait a minute, but he drove to his house?  Yeah.  Didn't he have to like drop his friend off?  You would think he would drop his friend off, but I guess he was so drunk he...  Maybe he thought his friend was sleeping and he said, all right, just sleep it off.  He didn't say anything, he just walked in the house.  Sleep it off.  He said, look, we'll go back and grab your skull tomorrow.  I'm tired.  Just nap on I-80. 
[00:58:00]  Look, I'm too drunk.  I can't drive you home.  Don't lose your head over it.  I'll take you home tomorrow.  Yeah.  Could you quit bleeding and hemorrhaging all over the side of my car?  We'll take your skull out of the leaves, but I've got to get a few winks.  Oh.  Yeah, that is drunk.  How do you not notice your friend's head is off?  I don't know.  If you're that drunk, maybe he was in a blackout and didn't realize it.  Now you are a pro with the blackout.  And if you're functioning, you're not thinking right, you're in the blackout.  You don't know what's going on, so maybe he's an alcoholic. 
[00:58:30]  Do you drive?  As far as I know, I was always good.  Wow.  Did you ever drive?  One time, there was one time I got home and I didn't remember driving home.  Yeah.  Blacked out.  But not anymore.  Didn't take off any friends' heads or hit anybody?  No.  No, I just ended up married in Vegas and ended up in the Kansas City.  Yeah, we know that story.  We love that story.  Wow.  For the counterfeiter.  He could have been in a blackout and not even realized it.  Mm-hmm.  So that's probably... 
[00:59:00]  That's rough, though, man.  Yeah.  Then he gets five years.  You know, you already decapitated your buddy.  He's got to be feeling guilty.  Yeah, you would think.  A little guilt there.  Yeah.  The Braum family actually asked for leniency for Hutchison because he was a victim's childhood  friend, so that's got to be a little rough.  Yeah.  Plus, they were both drunk, so...  All right.  You don't mean to lop your friend's head off the support cable?  No.  No.  No.  This happens.  That is sick.  Must have made that flung sound. 
[00:59:30]  Shung.  Dude, you all right?  All right.  Sleep it off.  Silence.  Sleep it off.  Sleep it off.  He vomited off his head.  You ever feel like that sometimes after drinking?  Like you're going to puke your head right off?  What happened?  He puked his own head off.  Probably a nice clean cut, too.  Oh, yeah.  How long are you alive where your head is rolling down the road right next to the car  where you're still alive?  You're seeing the pickup truck go away with that last bit of blood pressure left in your 
[01:00:00]  skull and eyes?  Right.  Going, oh, no.  Oh, boy.  This isn't good.  This is a bad day.  Say, why is that truck driving so fast away from me?  Uh-oh.  I was just in there.  I think that's my hands.  All right, Dee Dee, let's see your sex toys.  Wave it at yourself.  You guys want to see Dee Dee's sex toys?  I sure do.  All right.  Well, here's a whip.  Wow, that's the crop, huh?  One of them. 
[01:00:30]  I didn't bring all of them.  I didn't bring all of them.  I didn't bring all of them.  Well, I didn't.  What can we do with the whip?  Oh, well, duh.  You whipped somebody.  No, I know that, but can we do that to you today?  Well, I know you're going to.  Hold it up.  How long is that thing?  Is that like an Indiana Jones whip or a crop?  Here, let's see your technique.  That's a whip.  Anyway, let me show you the other stuff.  All right, there's her whip.  Don't slam that door.  It's killing me today.  It takes out all the oxygen.  Anyone else noticing the pressure change in your ears and stuff?  What is that?  Oh, nipple clams. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, you know what they are, nipple clams.  Just assumed.  You just kind of figured the fuck out, Dee Dee Jesus.  And this is probably one of Steve's favorites, right?  A cock ring?  Wow, you got a cock ring?  Steve, have you ever worn a cock ring?  No, I haven't.  I knew what it was when she...  Let me...  Hold that up.  But this is one of my small ones.  Now that would...  Why is it three rings?  That's for your Asian friends?  Are we getting arrested?  All right.  Who's that?  You're in a heap of trouble, boy. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Sarah?  Yeah, so...  Are these things washed?  Yes, of course.  I clean them.  They're clean.  Yeah, so you can put it in your mouth, Hope.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Now, how does that work?  I'm seeing three rings.  You put it...  You want me to explain that?  Yeah.  Hold it up and explain it.  Well, you...  It's to stop him from having an erection right away. 
[01:02:00]  What's the point?  Wait.  Wait, who's yelling, what's the point in the other room?  Who's me?  Ari.  Oh, Ari.  You saw this and went through.  We've had Ari on the show before.  Hey, Ari.  Yeah, it's just for...  It's a thing.  Many of us don't know what...  It's a thing.  Did you say to prevent an erection?  Yeah, for a while, yeah.  To prevent an erection for a while?  Why would you want to do that?  Yeah.  To prevent it or to keep it hard?  Because, you know, it's to prevent it from getting hard, yeah.  From getting hard?  I thought it was for, after it gets hard, it kind of keeps the blood in there. 
[01:02:30]  No, for a while, it's supposed to stop it.  Really?  And now, is there one of those go around the bag?  Well, actually, there's another one.  I didn't bring that, but yeah, you know a lot about this, sir.  No, I don't.  I've never used anything like that.  Yeah, but you know that there's another one like that.  I've looked in the back of the magazines, you know.  What's the matter?  What's the matter, Jim?  It's the ring.  I don't go for this.  You don't like it?  No, I certainly don't.  I'll hide it.  No, no, it doesn't bother me like that, but I just wanted to say why you'd want that around you.  It's uncomfortable.  Because some men like that.  Wait, what do you do with the ring, though? 
[01:03:00]  He's an easy catty.  Ben Sparks has one.  It's called a hula hoop.  Is he really that big?  We don't know.  We don't know what's going on down there, but it's giant.  We're trying to figure it out.  Whenever he leaves a basketball store, they stop him for stealing.  I don't know.  It's just like you just use it.  It's for fun.  You have to know, like be into the scene to understand.  Why is there three rings?  Well, there's some with four and five.  I mean, it's just this one has three. 
[01:03:30]  Does it depend on length or something like that?  No.  Is there like gigantor, average, and...  No, it doesn't have anything to do with that.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  That's wonderful.  What else do you have?  All right.  Well, I just brought a few.  I can't bring all.  You've got to save some for later, right?  Of course.  Teasing.  Do we get to whip you?  Well, that...  Yeah.  Get that indie whip.  Jimmy, you know how to use the whip? 
[01:04:00]  No.  Never use the whip.  What the hell?  There's police in here.  Yeah.  That's a state trooper, I think.  All right.  We're micing your ass.  I'm afraid, though, because there's a cop in the other room.  It's not illegal to be whipped.  You're not allowed to be whipped.  You see me?  Oh, we can use those.  He's holding up his handcuffs.  He's holding up his handcuffs, yes.  Your cuffs.  Yeah.  You might want to get cuffed and whipped.  Nice.  Well, like, use the whip on the counter.  I want to see your technique, at least. 
[01:04:30]  I don't really have...  Usually, it's like, I don't...  What?  You just, like, you whip.  I'm not going to, like, do it.  I don't know how to use the whip.  I've never used it.  You just...  Show me.  Oh, come on.  You use it.  I've never used the whip.  Are you left-handed, too?  No.  It's just...  Oh, okay.  All right.  Let's see.  I can't...  Oh, I'm nervous.  Nervous about what?  Nervous about what?  All these guys are...  Who's that one?  They're fans.  You're just demonstrating the whip. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, let's go.  Yeah, show the whip.  You know how to use the whip.  You just go...  Oh!  She just whipped Jimmy's arm.  Jesus!  She was trying to whip the floor, and it went awry to the right and nailed Jimmy in the arms.  Jimmy, you all right?  Yeah.  Let me put my face out so you can hit the eye.  Go ahead.  No, just let me see you crack it.  On the floor?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I can't do this.  All right.  Here's Dee Dee and her whip. 
[01:05:30]  Well, I'll try it, because I'm a little...  I'm shaky.  Why?  I don't know.  I can't do it.  You just did it?  You're a freak, man.  That is something.  You are.  I'm usually the submissive, though.  The what?  Submissive.  Submissive?  Could Jimmy use the whip on you?  Well, I know that was coming so soon.  I don't know.  I never used the whip before.  Well, just give it a shot.  Can I just tap her a little bit?  You ever snap the other guy's butts with a towel in the locker room, Jim?  No. 
[01:06:00]  I've never done this before, so I don't know if I'm going to do it.  Oh, did you hear that noise?  Yeah.  Jim, do this.  Go.  Where are you?  That won't...  It won't, uh...  No!  Careful.  You're getting Steve.  See?  He knows what he's doing.  I've never done it before.  Honestly, I've never done it before.  Well, you're doing good.  All right, let's bend over there, DeeDee.  I don't know what the right arm motion is.  I'll just wind up and swing as hard as I can.  I want to hold the end and swing the wood part.  Oh, God. 
[01:06:30]  Sorry.  I'm glad my mom's not looking for you.  All right, let's, uh...  We're miking your butt once again.  Sorry.  Wow.  Jimmy just whipped Steve.  Cut it out.  Go a little bit lower.  There you are.  All right, let's, uh...  We've got all the mics, though.  All right, yeah, well, bend over.  The mics are way down low.  No, I'm not probably...  If I don't do this right, this is my first time using a whip.  Jimmy looks like a natural on the plantation back in the 1800s.  I thought I said I would like a little cream with my coffee. 
[01:07:00]  There is not a mint leaf in my julep, boy.  I could have had you shot.  All right, Jimmy.  That's the whipping hand.  Hold on, with all the mics, we've got to move.  We move.  We put this one the other way, because I can't whip around the microphone.  Let me just wind this up.  Wait, wait, Steve.  Fix that mic.  No, no, a little, yeah.  Right around.  Damn it. 
[01:07:30]  I almost had him.  I was setting Steve up for a whipping.  Oh, I will, but I'm trying to get the timing down.  All right, let's turn down the music so we can hear this.  I'm just trying to get the timing down, because I've never whipped.  That's a little light.  Wait, Dee, grab one of the mics if you're going to stand up.  I'm just swinging to get the actual distance.  Yeah?  All right.  It's a little light so far.  I'm not doing it.  I'm trying to get the distance.  I don't want to, you know.  Right, Indiana.  Okay, not my back.  Indiana Norton.  Not my back. 
[01:08:00]  That's not a hurt.  Stand over.  Get the butt.  Okay, hold on.  That one hurt.  Good.  That one hurt?  Good.  He's a good old guy.  It's starting to sting.  My young son's in the car.  Oh, thank you.  I use that kind of language.  Oh, my God.  That one looked like it hurt.  It did.  It's sting.  I know it's sting.  Jimmy's really doing it.  God, Jimmy. 
[01:08:30]  These two make a really good couple in a really bizarre way.  Oh, my God.  I had a couple about the email.  Look at Jimmy's eyes.  Jimmy really gets into this.  I know.  Oh, that was my thing.  What is that sound?  Who's farting?  What guess?  Nice.  Did you just fart?  Did you guess, Stevie?  No, I didn't guess.  No, I'm hearing like, ah.  Stevie, what kind of guesser? 
[01:09:00]  Someone farted.  What?  That wasn't me.  All right, one more.  A couple more here.  All right, hold on.  I have to get the timing out because I moved.  I'm just getting the distance, that's all.  Okay, the distance.  Yeah, okay.  Harry's watching.  Ah, that was my thing.  I know.  I found going soft.  Oh, God.  Jimmy's really into this.  Oh.  Did that one hurt?  A little bit of stinging.  Oh, a little stinging.  Sorry.  Gindi, my friend. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  That was a good one.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  That was a good one.  I just got to get the distance right, that's all.  Uh-huh.  Jimmy's eyes are bugging out.  Your name's Toby.  That was, uh, wow.  Get me a water and don't spit in it.  That was impressive, Didi.  That one hurt.  Sorry.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  That's the only way you're going to learn.  No.  All right, Didi, we'll have more news with you in a little while?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Like the whip.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that was nice.  Yeah, do you enjoy that?  No, it has to be with the right kind of person.  Yeah.  Not everybody.  Not a psychopath like Jim?  I don't want to be the psychopath, but I'm just saying that it has to be somebody that  knows what they're doing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And do you get that on your bear butt?  Like, is that also, yeah? 
[01:10:30]  And does it leave, like, a red mark?  Well, yeah, for a little bit.  It left a red mark yesterday.  I think it would be easier with a shorter one, a little one.  A riding crop.  Oh, I have one of those, too, but I didn't bring it, but I'll save that for next time.  Sure.  You can't, like, bring out everything.  You can't bring it a little at a time.  A little at a time.  This, you've got to get used to how far away you are, because I'm not used to swing anything  that far away.  That was really good.  All right.  Well, you'll bring back some more sex toys the next time we're in D.C.  Okay?  Yeah.  It's Deedee, everyone.  She'll be back with more news in a bit here. 
[01:11:00]  That whip's good for jumping over chasms as you're stealing golden idols from caves.  Yeah, that one could do some damage, it looks like.  Kent from Sacramento.  What's up, Kent?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Got some nice, wacky little radio bits here going on here in Sacramento.  Oh, yeah?  The Rob, Arnie, and Don show.  Okay.  And what are they doing today?  Oh, they're bitching about women's sports and whatever's going on with the little, there's 
[01:11:30]  a little whore on here, just bitching and complaining about whatever.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And the reason you called us would be...  He wants to maybe put it on the radio.  Is that what you want to do?  Would you like to hear him?  All right, yeah, just, uh, all right.  Listen to this little snatch, bitching.  Okay, let's listen in.  All right, here we go. 
[01:12:00]  The best car made on the planet, and they're cheaper than minivans.  They've got to lug all their stuff.  They've got more room than minivans.  Oh, they don't have to.  They don't have to.  I went on minifan.  My parents, when I grew up, owned a 280Z.  You remember those?  Oh, my God.  Two-seaters.  I went on minifamily trips, curled up in the back.  Yeah?  No stuff.  And, gee, look at me.  I turned out just fine.  And our parents walked five miles in the snow, and there wasn't a bus route. 
[01:12:30]  Different, though.  Different.  They did that out of necessity.  My parents didn't do it out of necessity.  They did it because they refused to give in to my incestive whining about how I wanted to bring four stuffed animals, six coloring books, and an electronic game.  And you know what they did with me?  They used this really cool word that we don't use anymore.  No.  And I learned to respect authority and find a way to get along just fine.  Times have changed.  Times have changed because parents stop. 
[01:13:00]  People are stupid.  The best part of Rob's story that he's leaving out, it's very, very true, that he wanted to bring all that stuff.  He was 17 at the time.  Actually, it wasn't a bad line.  I don't know what we're talking about is the 2004 softball gold medalist with the blazing rise ball.  She throws it underhand and it rises.  Okay, okay, okay.  Okay, hold on a second.  One second here.  Oh, this is really bad.  Dirt.  Dirt, it rises.  She's throwing it.  Look, all you people that have played baseball and you see a pitcher throw ball, this is something that's been on my chest for a while. 
[01:13:30]  This rising fastball controversial.  There is no such thing as a fastball in Major League Baseball that will rise.  It is physically impossible for the ball to rise when you throw it overhand.  You are throwing the ball down towards the ground.  It cannot jump up.  It does jump up.  I've seen it happen.  She's throwing the ball underhand with her release point up towards the sky. 
[01:14:00]  So, of course, it's going to rise.  Yeah, yeah.  That's absolutely true.  That's been on his chest for a while?  When her fastball is thrown at 71 miles an hour.  Ooh.  That's fast.  Oh, yeah.  What would I like on his chest an SUV?  Yeah.  Or a joke book.  I would throw it faster than that.  And I'm a runt.  Of course you would because the ball is a big.  And she's a.  The bigger ball. 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  Oh, yes.  It's such a, it's much, it's like a shot put.  It's a heavier softball.  I like how they move on, though.  Yeah, they're rocking.  One subject, baseball.  71 miles an hour at the regulation of 43 feet is the baseball equivalent, and this is complete tripe, of throwing in the high 90s from 60 feet, 6 inches.  That's a bunch of mathematical gobbledygook that does not extrapolate in practice.  What?  That.  I don't even give a credibility.  That's retarded.  Here's the issue the letter writer was talking about.  She struck out major leaguers Mike Piazza and Mike Cameron and more than a dozen other stars on her own segment of This Week in Baseball. 
[01:15:00]  Alex Rodriguez is afraid to hit against her.  Cincinnati Reds all-star Sean Casey says she reminds him of Randy Johnson.  Boy, if I was Randy Johnson, I would sue him for slander.  Sean Casey sucks, anyway.  He's a human rain delay.  Put your batting gloves on and stand in the box, you jerk.  This issue was on Major League Baseball.  I saw clips of it, and this is the big, is that she struck out major leaguers. 
[01:15:30]  Okay.  No, she didn't.  Major League Baseball.  Yeah.  It's all right.  I mean, it's not awful.  Oh, it's, no, it's, I can't take the woman in there.  I agree.  The banter.  We're hoping for, like, wacky radio bits, though.  Yeah, we want bits.  Yeah, this is just guys talking and doing their show.  Yeah, we want to hear the wacky radio bits that people do out there.  If you're going to have a woman on your radio show, how about what we do?  You spank her, you give her a good whipping. 
[01:16:00]  That's entertaining.  And you give her some of the soap you bought from Lush.  Absolutely.  Lush.  All right, that's not bad.  I got handed to Kent from Sacramento, though.  That was perfect.  Yeah.  If you're going to play other radio shows, that was perfect.  We could hear every single word.  But he should have gotten to it quicker.  That inane explanation of what he called for.  Guys, I have a show on the line, and they're doing a wacky.  It's like, just get to it. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  Okay.  We'll take another break, Anthony, and continue with the program in just a bit here.  As we go to break, you know, Leno in the news because of his Michael Jackson thing.  Are we going to extrapolate gobbledygook from his testimony?  Watch mathematical gobbledygook.  He had to testify.  He had to testify, and then I guess he did some good jokes about it on his little show there.  So, jack off, and you could gobbledygook that comes out of my...  So, we'll go to break with this, okay? 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Star Wars fans dressed in the strange costumes.  You've seen them.  They look like aliens.  They look like creatures from outer space or something.  I'm sorry.  That was outside the Jackson trial yesterday.  I'm sorry.  I was confused.  I was in Santa Maria.  I forgot.  Actually, I ran into Michael Jackson in the lobby just before I went into court.  I'll tell you this.  No.  Yeah, I ran into him, and ironically, he was on his way into the little boy's room.  What are the odds?  Is that what it said on the door?  Little boy's room.  Little boy's room.  You know, it's interesting. 
[01:17:30]  I was sitting in that witness chair yesterday.  Michael Jackson was no more than six feet away from me.  Closer than you are right now.  And I was looking at him.  I thought to himself, you know something?  I think he's had some work done.  I don't want to start anything, but, you know, I'm thinking, hey, wait a minute.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it looks something different.  Now, I read in the paper today that Jackson's legal team was disappointed with my testimony.  In fact, Tom Mesereau, Michael's lawyer, called me last night and he said,  for Michael's next molestation trial, we're not having you back. 
[01:18:00]  Lost another gig.  Actually, you know the strangest thing about testifying yesterday?  After the trial, O.J. Simpson picked me up in his Bronco,  took me to Robert Blake's house where we had an Italian dinner.  It was surreal.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  Where's Gary Holley?  In the CD player.  No, when are we going to get him in studio?  Are we going to get him before Christmas, hopefully? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, but Ben is actually working on that right now.  Or are you guys booking him for Groundhog Day?  What's Ben working on?  I don't see Ben doing a whole lot of anything except eating cereal and herky and jerky all over the studio.  Herky and jerky.  And taking calls on his tiny little cell phone.  His little tiny cell phone.  His little chiclet cell phone.  If somebody walks in too fast, he can just eat his phone.  Ben's phone stinks.  What kind of phone is that?  Dude, hey.  Always gossiping about something.  Dude, Pedro does coke.  What?  My friend Tim from Boston knows what he does.  There's always some drivel he heard from some drunken mick at a party. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, dude, I've bought it from you, too.  It's coming in.  It's like horse shit.  Dude, I combed my hair with a car bomb.  You forgot that.  That's insane.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  He just giggles about nothing.  I'm like, Ben, I've got to get this done.  Giggling, idiot. 
[01:19:30]  He was laughing when you guys were talking serious about the death penalty.  Did anyone else get it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, dude, there's just too many poor people.  I'm like, get it.  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  Who doesn't love Ben?  I like the parody of Ben better than Ben now.  I thought someone got one of their teeth knocked out.  It was Ben's phone.  Your phone needs a filling.  I love the fact that he's always gossiping.  Always gossiping about somebody who has something to do with Boston. 
[01:20:00]  Jim Rice is from Western Children.  What?  Easy.  Oh, man.  Guys, yeah, that's funny.  Let me see your phone, Ben.  Got it on you?  Where'd you lose it?  Look at this.  Look how little that is.  Wow.  Tell me some small phones.  That stinks anyway.  It doesn't work that well.  That one. 
[01:20:30]  That's a tiny little phone.  That Ben parody is hilarious.  I wish people could see it and they just, you gotta know Ben.  No, they get it.  You just gotta know Ben.  He's so herky.  He's always moving around.  He's so jerky.  And he just always laughs in the wrong places when you're like being serious.  Like, dude, look, I'm running late.  Look, here's some gossip.  Yeah, there's some gossip.  It's like a market.  He's doing coke and it's like guns.  What? 
[01:21:00]  Always gossiping.  Always a little gossip.  He knows everyone in Boston.  Everyone.  Any bit of news that comes out of Boston.  He knows everything about Boston.  Everything that the common folk read about in Boston, he will know like ten layers deep  into the story.  I was fucking hanging out with Tom Brady.  What?  What happened with Tom Brady?  Some scandal that never materializes.  He was with ten broads or something. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that was the Tom Brady gossip because I got that call.  Dude, I was with the crafts at the new stadium.  There's a body buried in the basement.  It's insane.  I swear.  What?  It's crazy.  It's insane.  It's nuts.  I would have called you, but my phone was in my ear.  I couldn't get it out.  So I got a toothpick.  I got my phone stuck between my teeth.  I got to pick it out, dude.  This phone makes me physically ill.  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Cold-eyed bitch. 
[01:22:00]  Just a kiss on her lips.  Said I was on my knees.  I waited to get mad.  Cold-eyed bitch.  She was shaking her hips.  So that was all that I needed.  Mr. Eric.  You're right there.  All right.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program.  We're live from Washington, D.C.  Hi.  We'll be back in New York City, what, Tuesday?  Another long weekend for the boys. 
[01:22:30]  It's time.  We're exhausted from three days of work.  I got to leave early Tuesday.  I forgot to tell you.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm moving.  It's the only time the moving company could see me.  Oh.  I'm moving.  At 9 a.m. I have to be.  I thought Anthony and I were bad.  You're even worse.  Why?  No, didn't you leave the program a couple days ago because you had to bring a rental car back  or something?  Yeah, but that was not my fault.  That was because I brought the old Saturn in a week ago.  A Tuesday a week ago.  Were you a mirror that you broke?  When I broke the mirror off and there was some kind of an engine problem, so they gave  me a loaner for free. 
[01:23:00]  Engine problem?  And then there was something leaking, so it was supposed to be ready by Thursday.  It was probably you.  Yeah, exactly.  If we found this viscous fluid all over the passenger seat, let it go.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  But they said, look, the car's not going to be ready until Monday, which is almost a week  later.  But we're coming to D.C. Tuesday, so I can't, once the car is ready, I can't keep the loaner  car, like I would have had it yesterday, today.  You can't have it for next to three days to start charging for it.  Why can't you start moving Tuesday at 11 a.m.?  Because the movers only do it at certain times, and the building I'm moving into, which I 
[01:23:30]  don't want to say, they only allow you to move up until 6.  You can't move past 6 p.m., so the only other time they can start is 2 o'clock.  So I either have a morning or afternoon appointment.  Have you got the freight elevator?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  But I won't be done by that point, and then I'm in trouble.  Oh, my God, moving to New York City is the biggest hassle ever.  I don't know if other cities have that, I have no idea, but you have to make all sorts  of appointments with the building.  Yep.  You've got to make sure all the other tenants are satisfied when you're moving in.  They have to put the padding up. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, you've got to pad the elevator.  It's just a nightmare.  Well, I'm having this little thing knock through, a very small little hole knock through the  wall between the kitchen and dining room.  Who doesn't like a pass-through?  Well, Jimmy wants to talk to his visitors while he's cooking for them.  Yeah.  Right.  Exactly.  Jesus.  As I'm talking to a dominatrix, I'm just putting a little asparagus here.  I'd like you to eat it.  Don't ask any questions.  But, you know, they can't get the specs from the building, like the actual measurements  that it's supposed to be. 
[01:24:30]  Well, that's going to be a problem, so now I've got to go see a lady whose apartment  is the same as mine and take measurements from her apartment.  Are you kidding?  It's like, just call the builders and get the fucking measurements.  How hard is that?  It's four by two by whatever.  Thank you.  Then tear down that bitch of a bearing wall.  Hey.  Oh, no.  I'm trying to think.  Know that one?  No.  That one I don't know.  That's Mommy Dearest.  Oh, damn it.  When she's having the apartment redone.  Okay.  But the head of Pepsi Cola is her new husband, and she's spending all kinds of money, and 
[01:25:00]  they tell her she can't put a big window there because it's a bearing wall, and she says  then, tear down that bitch of a bearing wall.  That's Jimmy knocking down walls.  Knocking down walls.  And that's a man act.  Hey, guys.  Our friend Arthur Chien is back in the paper.  What?  You know, the dude that got fired because we did that assault on the media, and then  he cursed out.  What was your fault?  Oh, potty mouth, Arthur.  That's right.  Cursed out our intern Nathaniel there. 
[01:25:30]  Well, in the New York Post, page six, Axe reporter branded, Anthony.  You can't watch Arthur Chien on CBS Channel 2 anymore.  The reporter was fired last week for uttering the F word on air, but you could buy a plethora  of products with his face on it.  Yeah.  See, we kind of felt a little guilty, I got to tell you.  A little bit of guilt when we were handing out our T-shirts that said, what the fuck is  your problem, man?  T-shirts.  Remember that from earlier this week?  Of course I do.  And I guess you could still get them, the X-rated version from some website. 
[01:26:00]  Maybe Steve will help us.  Ah, yeah, Steve's running in here.  Some website.  Just go on the internet and look around.  Steve, what's the website where you could get the Opie and Anthony, what the fuck is  your problem, man?  T-shirts?  X-rated shirts dot com.  Those are the ones that aren't bleeped out.  It actually spells out fuck.  Thank you.  So we were handing out T-shirts on our show a couple days ago, and I got to tell you,  I'm feeling a little guilty, kind of taking advantage of the fact the guy lost his job  over something we did.  Well, Arthur Chen's doing the same thing, buddy. 
[01:26:30]  You can buy a plethora of products with his face on it.  CafePress.com is hawking a line of Chen-branded mugs, T-shirts, buttons, tote bags, messenger  bags, barbecue aprons, teddy bears, and even a Chien classic fong.  What?  This guy can't have anything to do with this.  There is no way he has anything to do with this.  I guarantee he has something to do with this.  It's got to be one of his friends, do you think?  Yes.  Some are emblazoned with the words, what the fuck is your problem, man? 
[01:27:00]  The question Chen, who thought he was off the air, yelled at two hecklers.  David Yee, who is selling the Chien merchandise, said he was inspired by the popular T-shirts  of revolutionary...  Oh, that dude, Che Guevara.  Che Guevara.  I can't get enough of those shirts.  Those are hip.  Chien sort of sounds like Che, he explained.  People are buying it.  Meanwhile, Chen's friend Ian Gerard, the founder of GenArt, has circulated an email calling 
[01:27:30]  the firing ridiculous and urging recipients to complain to various Viacom and Channel 2 executives.  Chien tells us he was devastated by his dismissal and says he's currently looking for a new job.  I've got bigger things to worry about than the shirts, basically, he said.  Yeah.  There you have it.  And it looks like Viacom and Infinity Broadcasting has bigger things to worry about as well.  A little segue, Anthony, to the next story.  Ah, very good. 
[01:28:00]  Yes.  Another female jock causing problems for a radio company.  Yep.  We've been talking about this, you know, every once in a while.  These women that get involved with these radio stations, they're just sitting around waiting  to sue their employer.  I've seen it happen so many times.  Something goes wrong.  Since I've been doing radio.  So, you know, over the years, people have wanted us to have a lady as part of our show.  It's just never going to happen.  They ruin everything. 
[01:28:30]  Never.  The liability.  They really ruin everything.  They want to be cool.  They want to be one of the guys.  But as soon as you go a little too far, they're getting a lawyer and they're suing the company.  They're suing the DJs.  I have a really good friend that we talk about on this show, by the way, a bunch.  And one of the nicest guys I've ever met in my life, one of the coolest, has helped so  many people on radio.  And he had a female co-host news girl thing that was just a complete hose bag.  Really?  Complete hose bag.  And one day she decided she didn't like it anymore and sued everybody for sexual harassment. 
[01:29:00]  It was dragged through the courts for years and years.  Well, this is what they do when they're fired for some reason.  Maybe they're not getting along.  Maybe they're not enjoying their job anymore.  Why just quit and try to find another job when you can sue the company, make millions  of dollars, and never have to work again?  It's winning lotto.  It's like you won the lotto.  Why wouldn't you do that?  This system is in place that gives them the ability to do this because people are stupid. 
[01:29:30]  So why wouldn't you do this?  Maybe you've got to actually say, eh, good.  Good for her.  She's working the system because stupid jackasses have put this in place.  Yeah, well, here's the latest one.  Perfume allergy brings $10.6 million for a DJ.  $10.6 million.  A disc jockey whose severe allergy for a colleague's perfume?  Yeah.  Ultimately led to her being fired by a country music radio station and has been awarded $10.6 
[01:30:00]  million by a jury.  I didn't think you could do this.  We should have sued because we had to freaking use the same microphone that Don from the  Don and Mike show used.  Oh, we could have sued.  And we hate those fuckers.  But let me tell you a bit of reality.  His breath stunk so bad.  And he used the same microphone I did before me.  Yeah.  It was horrific.  Remember what we had to do every day?  Pete Johnson.  We had to take off the windscreen and completely wash it and bleach and all sorts of cleansers, 
[01:30:30]  what have you.  Soak it.  The engineer every day had to come in, take that off, wash it, dry it, and then spray  it with Lysol.  No joke, man.  It was so awful I would get the dry heaves someday.  I mean, his bad breath just coming off the windscreen that he was using.  I could have sued for that.  Yeah, why not?  Pretty much, right?  It's kind of similar.  Sure.  Infinity Broadcasting, our old company.  I hope he was awarded one dead puppy.  Little bag of puppy guts. 
[01:31:00]  And a poem by Frida.  It was awful.  Remember that, though, Ian?  Yeah.  Every single day we had to go through this whole thing to clean out the windscreen.  Infinity Broadcasting owned WYCDFM in Southfield, Michigan.  They discriminated against Aaron Weber, the station's top-rated midday disc jockey.  The federal jury declared in its verdict delivered on Monday in U.S. District Court.  How did they discriminate? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, what discrimination was done?  Weber's suit claimed her violent reaction to toxic chemicals, in parentheses.  Toxic.  Which had been spilled in the radio station's studio in 1999, caused her to suffer chemical  burns in her airways, vocal cord swelling, difficulty breathing, and laryngitis.  If I love when lawyers get a hold of something, was this annoying your throat?  Yeah.  Okay.  So we'll write down that it was really, really detrimental to your line of work. 
[01:32:00]  It gets better.  The toxic chemicals also had the effect of increasing Weber's sensitivity to her colleague's perfume.  Okay.  Something was spilled in the studio.  Right.  And, you know, some engineers or whatever working on the studio spilled some kind of, quote,  it's in quotes, toxic chemicals.  What could that be?  What could that possibly be, first of all?  It could have been head cleaner stuff, alcohol.  You know, what do you use in a studio? 
[01:32:30]  I've been doing radio for 20 years or so now, including college radio, and I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, well, why don't they list it?  Acetone.  You're not really using a lot of toxic chemicals in a radio environment.  So the toxic chemicals that were spilled in the studio, Anthony, had the effect of increasing  Weber's sensitivity to her colleague's perfume.  Her doctors warned of her severe allergy to the perfume worn by an afternoon disc jockey, 
[01:33:00]  saying further exposure could risk the possibility of death.  So now some dude is just doing his stupid radio show, and he wears cologne.  Was it a chick or a guy?  Or it could be a girl.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Well, they said perfume.  You're right.  Okay.  So she comes in with her perfume.  Yeah.  And how is that affecting the Southern Broad?  Especially middays and afternoons.  That means middays goes first from 10 to 3 or whatever that is, and then afternoon lady  comes in from 3 to 7. 
[01:33:30]  So she's done by 7.  So this whole next, when is this, what are they, a pass each other in the hallway?  We'll pass each other in the hallway.  All right.  Her doctors warned of her severe allergy.  Okay, we did have the possibility of death.  Weber's suit also said she faced retaliation after she filed a discrimination complaint  with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  She argued the station did not accommodate her health issues, and she missed work, which  contributed to her 2001 firing.  Oh, boy.  The country stinks.  $10 million.  Ugh. 
[01:34:00]  $10.6 million.  For that.  No.  Well, that's why you can't.  If she was affected by the afternoon chick's, you know, perfume, then avoid her.  Yeah.  It's not worth $10.6 million.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  And Infinity just paid it out.  Did they?  Well, it looks like they fought it, though.  I mean, it was in court and stuff.  I'm sure they're not happy with this one.  Got to defend them a little bit.  I mean, they had no choice.  They did fight it.  They'll appeal, too.  She won't get this money right now. 
[01:34:30]  Guaranteed that they will get knocked out.  Some federal judge will throw it out.  Wow.  Dude, when I see women walking around a radio station, I cringe.  I know.  Especially because what we do, I barely make eye contact.  I'm like, hey, what's up?  And I just walk away as fast as possible.  He looked at me.  Right.  And made it an uncomfortable work environment.  Yuck.  There was someone in New York that heard one of our really, really bad promos.  Actually, it was the Stalker Patty remix that a lot of people love.  The Drew Boogie remix.  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak. 
[01:35:00]  And, you know, Patty's talking really dirty because she's reading out of, what, Hustler  or Penthouse or whatever?  Yeah, and it's all cut up, just taken out of context.  And one of the females we work for in New York City.  I saw her go like this.  Hit the desk.  Jump up and leave.  And I made the mistake of going, yeah, that one's a little rough.  Because I was trying to be, you know, nice.  Oh, boy.  It's like, yeah, that's a rough one, huh?  And she was like, and walks out.  I'm like, great.  Lawsuit.  And then I'm thinking, oh, my God, why did I even say anything? 
[01:35:30]  Now you opened your gap.  Because now somehow it's going to be twisted.  Of course.  I'm kind of exaggerating because nothing has come of it.  But that's how paranoid I am, you know?  There's got to be a certain, like, look, if you know the type of environment you're in,  if you want to work there, great.  But if you don't, then don't work there.  What's the problem?  If you're working at a department store and somebody's singing the Patty song,  perhaps there's a problem in that work environment.  If you're in radio, no. 
[01:36:00]  That's what, this is what happens.  This is a show.  Right.  These guys are pigs.  Yeah.  They're pigs.  They talk about things that the guys I sleep with think about.  That's exactly what it is.  I have the right to work in an environment where I shouldn't be subjected to the...  Oh.  Subjected to another woman's perfume?  It's gotten to that point?  If someone's grabbing your tits or your ass at work,  or constantly harassing you sexually,  I mean, all right, that's one thing.  I mean, you've got to quit because you're cockteasing him 
[01:36:30]  and he's going to have the right to take what he wants.  But if you're offended by someone's perfume or their language on the air,  just fucking beat it.  Leave.  Beat it!  Yeah, what happened to that?  Where you're not happy in your workplace,  find another goddamn workplace...  Beat it!  ...or suck it up and deal with it.  Now it's all about, oh, my rights and I'm suing.  It's...  Leave.  Can't hang an American flag in your cubicle in certain places  because I might have fed some filthy animal?  A Muslim.  Beat it! 
[01:37:00]  Jesus, the ACLU and these other groups are just revolting.  We're losing all those battles, too.  We're losing all of them.  Remember, as a kid, pop, pulling into the gas station,  maybe to have the car repaired,  and you stand there and wait,  and you'd get such a thrill looking in the toolbox of the mechanic  because he'd have nudie pictures in there.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  You know, you'd see that,  and they made him take all those down.  Now you can't have any type of nude 
[01:37:30]  or even girls in bikini pictures or anything in the workplace,  even at a goddamn gas station.  Oof.  That's too bad.  But then keep complaining that the guys don't want you around  and guys don't want to hang out with you  and guys don't think you're funny.  That's why.  Because your sensibilities are not funny.  Yeah.  The majority of times, I know there's funny female con...  I know plenty of them that are actually funny people.  Blah, blah.  I'm sorry.  That's fine.  I'm sorry.  You know we watch TV as we do our radio show 
[01:38:00]  because there's news happening all the time.  Fox News alert.  Murder suspect stalls traffic by sitting on 18-story grain.  Shoot him down.  Absolutely.  Will you just shoot this fucker?  Oh, my God.  What?  How about lowering the crane while he's on it?  How funny is that?  He's like, he knows he's getting arrested,  so he's...  He climbed the crane.  He climbed the crane.  18-story grain and he's just sitting there.  That's great.  Just lower the fucking thing.  Oh, my God.  You know how many people are just in traffic fucking hating that guy? 
[01:38:30]  Wonderful.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Brian in Florida.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, I got Lex and Terry down here doing the 900 thing.  They're halfway through it, though.  You want to hear it?  Yeah, all right.  Let's listen to Lex and Terry again.  They thought they got a bad rap last time.  And eggs.  And then milk to the right consistency, to the right...  It's perfect, you know?  And then put them on your brittle or in your pan with another... 
[01:39:00]  Okay?  They're cooking with over.  Exactly.  You don't need to buy that back stuff.  Everyone usually has flour, sugar.  Everyone usually has this stuff in our house.  She's usually making people like this.  Paul, Paul, Paul, all burn.  Get your skin.  Of course, these people are going to be here all day, burn.  This is an unannounced visit.  Burn it.  There's definitely not a weekend visit.  Burn.  Oh, hey, I do it.  Are you smoking?  No.  I'm lost.  Not my William.  Well, basically, they do soundboard.  They call, like, phone numbers, and then they have a soundboard and play clips. 
[01:39:30]  Uh-huh.  Well, okay.  Then you just tell me so I won't ask no questions.  Okay.  You're safe, dog.  I'm not so bad.  This is good.  Hey, I got your Christmas present right here.  I sent it to you.  If you didn't receive it, that's not my fault.  That's sad.  You know what?  It's probably a loss in the mouth.  Yeah.  That's not going to happen.  Oh, yes, it does.  You know what?  I didn't register it, though. 
[01:40:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Did a mistake.  Yeah.  The next time I will register it.  To the mistake.  Definitely not wearing my underwear.  All right.  When's your birthday?  Born August 12th, 19th.  Oh.  Ninety-fifty-two-y.  Nice.  All right.  That's awful.  Once again.  Wow.  We thought we gave him a bad rap last time, but once again, it's just awful.  That's really bad.  Awful radio from Lex and Terry.  What?  It's the phrasing of that.  Just awful radio from Lex and Terry.  Oh, it really is. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, you know, guys never made it into a real radio market, and they got all pissed  off because we listened in on their show, what, a month ago, and it was awful, and that  sounded very awful as well.  Mm-hmm.  Just bad sound clips playing to some operator somewhere, I guess.  All right.  Those are inaudible sound clips.  Those are the type of bits you should do when you're not on the air.  You go to a production room, and you do it.  You edit it down nice, so it's guaranteed to be really good when you play it on the 
[01:41:00]  air.  Right.  But they're obviously doing it on the fly.  I guess they're kind of lazy or whatever.  Why are you pissed off over there, Jimmy?  Just because I set the mic creak again, and it's like, it's distracting, and it's hard  to, I don't want to move the mic, and it's like, why wouldn't they just fucking grease  it?  He threw his paperwork like a mad person.  I mean, we're in the middle of the bit.  We're doing something, so I sit down, and I want to pull this forward just to get, and  that.  It's like people at home will hear that shit, and it's irritating, and it takes you out  of what you're listening to.  Well, we're all greased up in New York, so.  I know, but just when, it's something like that. 
[01:41:30]  It's like, come on, man.  Oh, it's a golf hobby.  Just grease it.  All right, we got some more Psycho Ex-Girlfriend remixes, Anthony.  Oh, some remixes.  Who do we got today?  Today we got Alan Sniffen.  Oh, okay.  That could be fun.  We'll put that together.  That's clever.  Well, we don't.  I hope it works.  Frank TRC.  All right. 
[01:42:00]  Steve, we got to give these guys credit.  We can't just play their stuff and make believe that we came up with it.  These guys are working hard behind the scenes for the show.  You know, listeners, they got a part of this program at this point, and we want to give them  credit when they hand in something good.  But let's go to John in Kentucky as we wait for Steve to come in here.  John, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  We're good.  I was trying to tell you the sexual harassment thing in Kentucky this week.  In Louisville, a guy named John Ziegler, who was a shock jock, dated a former TV reporter, 
[01:42:30]  and after they broke up, he got on the air and started talking about how her bush was shaved  and the best boo job he had ever seen, all of these other sexual things they did.  And she sued him for $2 million, and he won an unanimous verdict this week.  He won?  Yeah, he won.  Good.  Excellent.  Oh, very good.  Okay.  Wow.  Good for the shock jock.  Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock. 
[01:43:00]  Shocking.  Shocking verdict.  Shock, shock.  Phil in St. Louis.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, Mike.  I had, on the harassment deal again, I worked for a retail company and had a lady come in and was offended.  I was the store manager at the time.  I was offended because one of my people had Goofy on their shirt, and it said Walt Disney World.  And she tried to sue the store.  She got a lawyer, and it ended up going to the legal department for our company.  And she was trying to sue our company for $750,000 for allowing one of our employees to wear Goofy on their shirt. 
[01:43:30]  I went to the point and talked to her.  I thought it was a joke, and I talked to her for 30 minutes, and this lady was just diehard.  It went on for six months before she finally lost.  That's what I couldn't figure out.  She probably has a retarded kid or something like that.  Something else her ovaries did wrong, and she wants to blame Disney for it.  It's just appalling on that thing.  It's like you said, passing people in the hall, just not even making eye contact, just looking down at your feet. 
[01:44:00]  It's gotten to the point.  And men are visual creatures.  And, you know, you work with these women with the tight-fitting shirts and the cleavage and stuff.  And of course you're going to look.  You've got to grab their ass.  Yeah.  Of course you're going to look.  It's come to a point where you can't even put a banana in your pants and squeeze it at schoolchildren as they walk by.  What the hell is the world coming to?  I'm hip.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right.  All right.  Okay, Anthony.  The Psycho Ex-Girlfriend versus Alan Sniffen was done by Ray from Deer Park. 
[01:44:30]  Ray.  I hope he did a good job because the premise is very good.  Alan Sniffen runs the New York Radio message board.  He had commented on our situation with Arthur Chan getting fired for our assault on the media.  So I guess he took those audio comments from his message board and put them together with the Psycho Ex-Girlfriend.  You hurt me emotionally more than anyone has ever done.  And you don't see anything wrong with that?  You don't see anything strange about that? 
[01:45:00]  I just don't feel the need to tell you that you are just a worthless fucking piece of crap.  Yeah, well, you know, maybe I am.  So you really wanted to be over?  Is that what you want?  You've known me a long time.  We've had back and forths before.  You went out for drinks tonight.  You don't call me back.  You don't listen to my messages.  No, no, that had nothing to do with it.  I'm done doing this thing with you, chasing you, until the part where you'd exhaust me.  You created the environment, and I agree with you.  But it didn't happen in a vacuum. 
[01:45:30]  Come on here.  Let's get real about what happened.  Fuck you.  Hey, it's okay to go out there and act like a lunatic.  Go ahead.  I've given you everything.  You're so pompous and full of it.  You know what?  Have fun with your fucking stubbornness, because I can't deal with it.  Please, by all means, it's okay.  You're not a nut.  Whatever.  I hate you.  Because you know what?  You've tortured me.  You've made me feel like shit.  Here's the problem.  I don't care.  Really, I don't. 
[01:46:00]  This is what you get.  That's not bad.  That's pretty good.  That was a great one.  That is a pretty good one right there.  It made sense back and forth.  His voice is all, you know, excited.  Can I tell you how many times I heard that dumb theme song running through my head yesterday?  It's Alan Sniffin.  It runs through your head.  Totally.  It gets stuck in your head like a commercial jingle or something. 
[01:46:30]  Do we have it?  I'd love to.  That's why I was getting Derek.  Just because I know it will bother people to hear it, and it will run through there.  Okay.  I had it up here, and then we took it off the thing.  Derek will save the day.  The American Psycho one's not that good, Steve.  Hey.  Well, we can take a listen, at least.  I'd both be stupid.  Lush.  It starts off okay, and then it kind of falls away.  All right.  We'll give it a try, but first this.  I guess we're ready to go with the rest of the thing here, guys. 
[01:47:00]  I need the jingle first.  Here's Alan Sniffin.  All right.  This is Alan Sniffin, and I've got my response to Opie and Anthony on Ford Reflections for  May 24, 2004.  MusicRadio77.com.  That's right.  Ford Reflections.  I love it.  I guess we're ready to go with the rest of the thing here.  I need the jingle first.  Here's Alan Sniffin.  All right.  This is Alan Sniffin.  Where did he get the people to sing that?  He actually had to hire people, and they said, what are the lyrics? 
[01:47:30]  You say, it's Alan Sniffin.  All right.  Then what do we do?  I'll repeat it.  Who's Alan Sniffin?  I am.  I am.  That's it.  Oh, you're in radio?  No, I'm a dentist.  There's a jingle company that'll do that for you.  There's jingle companies.  Wait, hold on.  Sorry, Steve.  Go ahead.  There's jingle companies that specifically do this stuff, and you just send them dialogue,  and they'll crank it out.  Can we get some of that stuff done?  That hokie jingle stuff from the show?  I think Rage Against the Machine has to stop, and the new theme song should be, bop, bop, 
[01:48:00]  bop, bop.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  We should steal his theme song.  And little Jimmy.  Bop, bop, bop, bop.  Yeah, a lot of people have mentioned it sounds like a Brady Bunch song.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da.  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  Of Alan Sniffin.  Da-da-da.  Let's just hope Alan has different habits than Robert Reed.  All right.  Let's go to Kentucky.  Say hi to Mike.  What's going on, Mike?  I'm not a whole lot.  Just driving a truck, getting ready to go up to Canada. 
[01:48:30]  I'm in Kentucky right now.  Hold on.  Alan, Alan, Sniffin.  That's how it cuts out quality to it, doesn't it?  Follow the money.  When I was in the military, there was a female lead.  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.  You're goddamn, man.  Slow down, bro.  All right, what happened to you?  You were in the military.  I was in Kuwait in the military.  And whenever you pass an officer, you're supposed to salute and say your company motto. 
[01:49:00]  Well, I was in the infantry.  And our company motto was all beef, because there was no women or anything like that.  So I passed this female officer bitch, and she absolutely said all beef.  And she brought it for the post commander for sexual harassment.  Well, goddamn.  I have no idea what this thing is.  Wait, what happened, Jimmy?  Hold on, hold on.  Mike, Jimmy's going to translate.  One of the things you've got to do when you walk by an officer is salute and say your company motto.  Okay. 
[01:49:30]  And his, because it was all guys, it was all beef.  That was his company motto.  So he walked by a female officer and saluted her and said all beef, and she had him brought up on some sort of sexual harassment thing.  That's right.  That's right, because she's worried about sexual harassment in a Middle Eastern country like Kuwait.  Yeah.  Hey, do they make the military, do they make women in the military dress in that awful clothing when they go out?  Yeah.  Yeah, they've got to cover their faces, don't they?  To respect the culture.  Oh, the culture.  What culture?  Yeah, I know.  What does all the civilian women do?  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  As long as they're in military uniform.  All right, Mike, thank you.  All right.  Okay, Mike.  Thank you, Mike.  They all hold hands over there, the men.  It was really creepy in the Kuwait airport.  We waited an hour and a half.  You actually saw the men holding hands?  Oh, my God.  We were rolling.  We were in the Kuwait airport, because they're the laziest fucking people ever in Kuwait.  I understand why their military was overrun by Saddam, because it's all what they call  these third country nationals, I think they call it, TCNs, where they actually are the  ones who are the military, because they're all spoiled and rich in Kuwait, where they just  get like $100,000 a year because they're oil rich. 
[01:50:30]  They don't have to work.  So the guys that work are resentful and lazy.  They don't like to work.  So that's why they're very, they took an hour and a half to stamp, I think, four or five  passports.  Come on.  Wow.  An hour and a half we sat there.  Savages.  And you saw them walking around holding hands in the airport.  In the airport, it was awful.  And Colin had me in tears, because he was just doing topical material, and he said they're  all like wearing those awful like pantsuits, like the Mary Tyler Moore show, which the  soldiers kind of just stared at that line, but it was one of the funniest things I heard  while I was over there.  That's exactly what they looked like. 
[01:51:00]  Holding hands with other men, buying soap, flush.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, calm down, Anthony.  Let's relax.  And oil rich.  Even though it's not black oil, it's white.  That winds up all over you.  All right, Steve says this one is mediocre, so you want to take a listen?  Which one is it?  Psycho X Girlfriend and American Psycho.  American Psycho?  Okay.  It had potential, is what Steve is saying.  I don't want to talk.  I think, um, Evelyn, that, uh, we've lost touch. 
[01:51:30]  I don't understand.  I need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale.  It cannot be corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.  You could be so mean.  Since I'm probably going to be moving back, I'm not repeating the cell phone.  Oh, my God, that was, uh, who did that?  Who did that?  I don't know.  Who did it?  I don't know.  Steve?  Who just stopped the program?  Because the bad must also get credit.  What listener stopped the program, Steve?  What listener is responsible for that crap? 
[01:52:00]  For 20 seconds, we'll never have back.  And it goes on for another minute and a half.  A minute and a half.  But we're getting smarter.  The old days, we would have played the whole thing.  Now, please.  We don't have time to waste with this.  That was...  That might have been sent in anonymously and wisely.  Of course.  Good choice.  I think that was sent in from, uh, one of the guys from the Lex and Terry show.  That stunk.  I like when, um, I like when on the message board, they post it before they send it to us. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  So they'll post it, and a few people go, oh, that's pretty good, or that sucks, or something.  And then, uh, they send it to us.  We play it and trash it.  Yeah.  And then the message board just jumps on and trashes the person.  So perhaps that one's posted somewhere, and we'll find out who it was.  I like the listeners that, uh, post their stuff on the message boards.  Yeah.  And then that stuff is never played.  I was wondering why our old boss was on Imus.  All right.  Sorry.  Who's your old boss?  Uh, Joel Hollander, who absolutely loves us and would love to, to bring us back to 
[01:53:00]  Infinity Broadcasting.  Whatever.  Um, sorry about that.  Anthony, uh, so they'll post some of their stuff, and, you know, people start commenting  about it, like you just said, and we never play their stuff, and then they get really  pissed off.  Well, I don't understand why the guys never played it.  Yeah.  Trust me.  We know better.  There's a reason.  If it's even remotely good, we'll play it.  This couldn't be accurate.  What?  This thing Steve just brought me.  This could not be.  What?  What happened?  The new Sirius portable unit. 
[01:53:30]  The Sirius IR instant replay, Sportster IR.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  This is it.  This company should start selling fast food out of the front door.  What happened?  Sportster IR unveiled.  Now, I'm not sure.  I'm thinking this.  It couldn't be this awful.  Is this their big news today?  I don't know.  It just says, an anonymous reader sent in some juicy, and they misspelled juicy.  There's no E before the Y in juicy.  Stupid ass who wrote this.  It's photos of the new coming Sportster IR instant replay. 
[01:54:00]  According to reliable anonymous sources, the Sportster IR will be available in stores next week.  Next week.  Sportster IR has been redesigned to be sleeker than its predecessor with an integrated FM transmitter and a new antenna.  But the real feature that everyone's been waiting for in the IR is a built-in internal memory that lets you record up to 44 minutes of content for later.  Come on.  Are you kidding me?  No.  44 minutes.  This has to be a joke. 
[01:54:30]  That's one Opie and Anthony segment.  This has to be.  44 minutes of content.  I'd like to see this online, and it's real.  This couldn't be accurate.  Sirius could not be this awful.  They couldn't have a 44-minute memory.  They should just get their products, you know, and just bring them in the back door of Best Buy and Circuit City and all that and hope no one notices.  Why are you sending out press releases?  Well, I understand.  The next thing they're going to do is they actually give you a cell phone with it so you can call somebody who's listening to it in their car, and they hold the phone up and you listen to it that way. 
[01:55:00]  I mean, the MiFi just blows them away.  What is the MiFi?  It's hours and hours of five hours?  Five hours.  Five hours.  Five hours.  Yeah, because I'm doing that all the time now.  I just push record in just 44 minutes.  This couldn't be accurate, Steve.  What's this from?  It's from a technology message board.  I think it's called orbitcast.com.  44 minutes of content, and you can listen to that script.  If that's true, integrated FM transmitter, new antenna, but the real feature, everyone waiting for, built-in memory, that lets you record up to 44 minutes of content. 
[01:55:30]  That's very convenient, by the way.  Of course it is.  It's like a portable laser disc.  It's just 30 pounds.  You hold it over your head and don't jostle it.  You can watch the film on your friend's back.  And it's not portable.  Look, it's plugging into things.  Oh, brother.  They are just awful over there.  And it isn't even the fact that we work here at XM. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, if I didn't know the companies from a hole in the wall and then wanted to do some research and went online and really just did research.  Hello.  A year ago, that's exactly what we were doing.  We researched both companies and then decided where to go.  I mean, for buying one of these things, though, you'd look and go online and go, oh, I could get this, handheld, completely portable, gets live programming, and I can record five hours of programming on it. 
[01:56:30]  Or I could get this, can't get live programming, isn't portable, 44 minutes.  Man, they must have been squee-  Could you get 45?  I cannot do it!  45 is impossible!  They're serious scientists working to squeeze an extra minute in.  They had to go with 44 minutes.  That is horrid.  There is a, um, after the whole thing about Hyundai and Howard came out, some Howard fans started this. 
[01:57:00]  Like, you know those online polls and petitions?  Mm-hmm.  Some Howard fans started one that was like, you know, fuck Hyundai, and it's been hijacked.  Well, but you've got to explain the story, because we're getting new listeners every day.  But basically, the story is Hyundai decided to go with XM instead of Sirius, because they didn't want Howard.  Right.  Okay.  So they're pissed off, and Howard fans are like, let's, you know, fuck Hyundai, man.  And he said, like, that online thing where you just sign the petition.  Mm-hmm.  And maybe two or three Howard fans were at first, and it has been hijacked by the pests.  Really? 
[01:57:30]  Oh, I'd say 35 or 40 to 1 are Opie and Anthony posts.  Our pests.  And they are hilarious.  The way they're slamming the Sirius unit, like, you know, Connor Peterson posted how  Dad tied a Sirius portable around Mom and then threw him in the water.  I mean, it is just fucking hilarious.  I would, this online, there's like 1,300 or 1,400 posts, 95% of them are ONA listeners,  and they're just hilarious.  That's classic.  They're hilarious.  They've completely hijacked it. 
[01:58:00]  Connor Peterson.  I love when Connor posts.  Yeah, or Scott from Modesto posts always makes me laugh.  Or Susan S., or Andrea Y., of course.  Someone on the message board, one of their SIG picks is the actual gravestone of the Yates  kids.  Have you seen that?  I know who he is.  Oh, you do?  He's the racist guy.  I forget his name.  He's really racist but really funny.  I wish I could remember his name.  Some of the stuff they do is so wrong and so bad on that board. 
[01:58:30]  It's got, like, and what is it?  Mommy's Five Little Jokes or something, and it's the actual Yates tombstone with the  little pictures of them on there.  It's just horrible.  Just awful.  And all he does is these racist SIG picks, which are just brutal and uncalled for.  You have to laugh at them, though, because they're funny.  And it's the same theme in every one.  But if you go on there, you'll find one.  I wish I could remember his name.  I'm so annoyed because I looked at a bunch of his stuff the other day and I got a good  laugh out of it. 
[01:59:00]  Speaking of which, maybe Steve could find this.  I'm looking at the audio we have for today's program.  Boating safety promo airs during Amber Frye movie last night.  What?  You have that?  Yeah.  They did the Amber Frye movie last night, Anthony.  It's not really worth going through.  But they were doing this boating safety promo going into commercials.  Oh, man.  Where is that thing?  Amber Frye.  An Amber Frye movie?  Amber Frye movie.  Who gives a shit?  And as they go to commercial, they're telling you how you should, you know, boating safety. 
[01:59:30]  Boating safety.  What was the name of the movie?  Pussy to Kill For.  Boating safety.  Make sure you clean all the pieces of cinder block out from under the seats.  Here it is, Anthony.  Tomorrow, do you have plans to go out on a boat this summer?  Every year, hundreds of lives are lost and thousands are injured and outings turned tragic.  We'll have a warning that couldn't save your life.  The fucking local.  Well, that's not even.  That's the national news.  We were talking about this. 
[02:00:00]  They have to tie in everything.  They have to tie in the movie of the week.  Of course.  So they have an Amber Frye movie going on.  And, of course, the news has to pop on and talk about boating safety tips.  Boating safety.  How you can lose your life in a boat.  Yeah, sure.  Are you pregnant?  Is your husband bringing home, like, cement in a rowboat?  Jesus.  How do you get a hotel under a different name?  Oh, the news sucks.  They really are the worst.  They did it last night after American Idol. 
[02:00:30]  Learn more about the Idols.  But first, firemen killed.  It was like, you motherfuckers.  How do you tie in?  It was a local, some kind of a fire or something that just killed people here in D.C.  And they tie it in with the American.  That's the teaser.  The American Idol.  Which is why, again, when you see a reporter get fired, fuck them.  Yeah.  That's who they are.  We'll talk more about the winner.  But first, a family dies in a job.  Oh, yeah.  Pieces of shit.  They love the big teaser.  They love to tie into whatever movie you're watching.  Who cares about the family? 
[02:01:00]  I want to hear about the Idols thing.  Don't make us wait for that.  I actually saw when the network premiere of Independence Day years ago, they actually had a news tie-in about UFOs and could it happen in our city.  It was the most ridiculous tie-in.  Like, could flying saucers come down and blow up our national monuments?  We'll tell you at 11.  What?  But they have to tie into every little movie and every little thing, thinking they're going to scoop you up to watch because you're watching the movie. 
[02:01:30]  If there's an invasion, will they actually have a black guy fly the rescue ship?  Tune in.  Oh, bro.  All right.  Armed fugitive on the crane.  The cops should just shoot him out of that fucking crane.  They should just blast him.  Is that him right there?  Yeah.  It is beyond funny.  The guy is 18 stories up in the air in this crane. 
[02:02:00]  The traffic is at a standstill.  A tucked-in shirt and khakis.  Please, God, let him fall.  He's wanted for murder and they don't know what to do.  Shoot him!  I didn't get a beating death of his girlfriend.  Her badly beaten body was found on Tuesday.  Good camera work, by the way.  He's moving up the crane and the camera's staying where he was.  Just staying there.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Guilty.  Shouldn't there be a blonde on his hand and he should be on the Empire State Building?  They want him back on the ground.  Well, no shit. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Armed fugitive on crane in Atlanta.  He's armed?  Yeah.  And he's going to a good vantage point with a weapon.  That book's repository building!  Why aren't they shooting this man down?  Why are they not shooting this man?  Why is he on a crane holding up traffic?  They should just shake that crane violently.  Keep tabs on that story.  Or lower it.  Just lower the crane.  Why does it take so long to do things?  It's not like a movie.  It takes hours for them to do things in real life. 
[02:03:00]  Speaking of movies, I saw National Treasure last night instead of The Aviator.  You did.  Oh, my God.  I would have went with The Aviator.  Or Deep Throat because it had a better storyline.  This movie was so awful.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I saw it in the hotel also.  Really.  Like, it looked like it could have been cool from the trailer.  And it was just a bad, like, Disney movie.  Oh, it was awful.  Really terrible.  Yeah, it was Disney, you're right.  Just...  Yeah.  What was that movie about again?  They want to...  There's, like, some story of treasure having been hit by the forefathers, which was actually 
[02:03:30]  a good idea.  Yeah, the founding fathers had buried a bunch of treasure somewhere.  And the clues were on money or something.  They were on money and on documents, like the Declaration of Independence.  Okay, that's what they had to get at, right?  And they had to get to the back of the Declaration of Independence.  Gotcha, gotcha.  So they had to actually get the copy, which is really under a lot of security.  And, like, the premise is good.  But when it started and I saw the Disney logo, I was like, it's a Disney movie.  And they decide in a week they're going to steal the Declaration of Independence.  And, of course, the chick that runs the National Archives is a beautiful blonde who eventually 
[02:04:00]  gets involved in the...  Oh, by the way, at the end, they find the treasure.  Yeah, of course they do.  And it's buried under the church on Broadway in New York, like five stories down.  Right.  So Nicolas Cage gets the treasure at the very end.  So don't watch it.  Don't watch it.  I hope you're on your way to rent it, fuckheads.  It was awful.  Unfortunately, he didn't uncover an acting lesson.  That stiff asshole.  God.  He's horrendous.  He's horrendous in every movie.  Plays the same exact role.  But he's had a career that spans years in very successful motion pictures. 
[02:04:30]  He was very good.  And I will say, leading Las Vegas, he was great in.  He really was great in that one movie.  But he's just awful.  The same guy.  So when he tries to deliver funny or...  You're not charming, stupid.  Act like the nephew of a genius.  That's what you should be.  You're the nephew of a genius.  Yeah, I just saw Face Off recently, too.  And that was just...  His acting in there is so bad.  Dude, when John Woo lands at JFK, they actually cut off his balls and hold them at the airport 
[02:05:00]  until he flies back to China.  He should never be allowed to direct another American film.  He did Hard Boiled.  He did A Better Tomorrow.  He did The Killer.  The guy is great when he's doing Asian films in Asia.  He's amazing.  That's Shaoyan Fat.  It all comes from the John Woo movies.  He's brilliant.  Tarantino stole all those camera angles.  Those double-gun points at each other shit.  Everybody dies at the end like was written in True Romance.  That's all John Woo.  But overseas, here, he can't do any of it.  Why is that?  Because we stink and we're a dumb country.  I don't know.  Why don't we award $11 million to some whore who works at a country station who doesn't 
[02:05:30]  like somebody's CK-1?  We're dummies.  We're a nation of dummies.  We really are.  That's funny.  All right.  Let's get back to the Psycho X Girlfriend remixes, Anthony.  We have another one here that features one of our pals.  Ron from Ron and Fez, Anthony.  Oh!  That's all?  That's all you had on that?  Is it all?  Because I'm reading.  I just sound excited about it because it's our pal, Ron.  And I go, oh!  And then I'm reading, like, instant feedback. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  This is from Ass Suck at Wackbag.  Is that the Ass Suck?  The Ass Suck came up with this one.  Hey, buddy.  I don't understand how you could be so mean.  You know, your ears are high, Zelda.  You know what?  You hurt me physically that night, which was crossing the line.  And you expect me to be the perfect girlfriend.  You pushed me to the point where I couldn't walk for two weeks.  Right now, just to make sure, you and I will never be in the same room together alone. 
[02:06:30]  Just so we know.  Just to keep me from doing anything horrible.  You hurt me emotionally more than anyone has ever done in my entire life.  I just want you to know that.  I'll do it tonight, bitch.  I'll do it tonight.  And you tortured me.  And you knew all my insecurities and all my weaknesses.  And you play on them.  And then I guess when he was unconscious, he raped me.  He raped me.  I've been raped. 
[02:07:00]  Am I your perfect?  I don't want a criminal baby.  Amort it.  Fuck you.  Call here again and I'll rip that damn phone out of the wall.  I'm not playing games with you.  I'm not effing playing games.  I hope you're fucking happy.  I'll chase you down the damn street.  Bitch. 
[02:07:30]  That's not bad.  It started awful and got good.  Yeah.  That's some moments there, right?  It ended well.  Psycho, you're on Ron and Fez.  Hi, Psycho.  Psycho.  Hi, Psycho.  We have an update on those guys?  No.  Nothing really?  I don't know.  I was hoping to give my DC gig a couple of plugs if we could talk to them.  Because I can't do regular radio in DC here.  You know?  The old dumpster gums and mics.  No, you can't.  I wouldn't even ask them.  That would be too awkward for them.  If Don and Mike bully these poor guys out to lunch, you know they're going to give Ron 
[02:08:00]  and Fez a lot of crap in the same studio.  You know, Big Kev was doing some kind of one of those sci-fi shows down here in DC and  wanted to just show up on Ron and Fez's show and talk and the program director said  no because he's too tied into our show.  They're so petrified of any aspect of Opie and Anthony turning up on an Infinity Station.  Well, that's awesome.  He's kissing Don's ass because the program director is obviously a paranoid faggot.  I don't know who he is.  But he's obviously just such a scared, pussy-whipped, fucking one-market zilch. 
[02:08:30]  And that's what you are.  You're all one-market nothing.  I don't even know his name.  Of course, no one knows his name.  All right.  We have one more, Anthony.  Pat O'Brien versus Sergeant Hartman as far as these remixes go.  Really?  I don't know if...  Steve, is this one all right?  Where's Steve?  Thumbs up?  Oh, uh-oh.  He's giving the...  Uh-oh.  He gave this.  The hand.  He gave the...  Put your hand out.  Put your hand out flat and then shake it, wiggle it. 
[02:09:00]  Left, right, left, right, left, right.  It starts off okay.  It might have been a nice concept, but it then falls off.  Thumb down, pinky up.  Yes.  Pinky down, thumb up, repeat.  That's either the I'm not sure or the Ben Sparks steady as a rock pose.  Could this be the death of another bit?  It might be.  It might be.  This is what sucks.  This is what happens with the show.  The listeners take over, do some great stuff for us, and then it takes just one, and then  next thing you know, no one sends in any more. 
[02:09:30]  You put it in the ground.  Kind of like that Ramon thing that happened a few months back.  Ramon, run this into the ground.  The listeners coming up with the Ramon promos, and then all of a sudden it was done, and no  one even wants to hear the name Ramon anymore.  I do.  You do?  I love Steve's Ramon's promos.  Jimmy was the one that told me to keep going with it.  I did.  I felt that there was something still there, because even if it's bad, it's still kind  of funny that it's just, you know, there's such an idiotic relationship.  All right.  Well, let's listen to this.  Do another one by the time we get back from break.  Okay. 
[02:10:00]  Uh-oh.  You're so fucking hot.  Who the fuck said that?  Um, it's me.  Holy dog shit, the very fucking godmother said it.  I'm so fucking into you.  Ah!  Well, no shit.  What have we got here, a fucking comedian?  Um, I should fucking have sex.  Okay.  Are you shook up?  Are you nervous?  Um.  Yes, sir!  I don't want you badly.  I don't know you want me.  I don't want to lick your tits.  Well, thank you very much. 
[02:10:30]  I bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the  goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach around.  Um, yes.  Shut my cock.  Shit, I'll bet you can suck a golf ball through a garden hole.  Um, yes.  You little piece of shit, you look like a fucking worm.  Let's have fun.  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you and suck your tits.  Get on your knees, scumbag!  You had best to un-fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and shit down your neck!  You little scumbag! 
[02:11:00]  I got your ass!  Ah!  Ah, Steve was accurate.  It didn't make much sense.  Yeah.  It wasn't horrendous.  Yeah.  But it was...  Because I love hearing those clips.  Yeah.  They're always great to hear.  I forgot how good, get on your knees, scumbag.  Oh, that is a good one.  That's a vicious line.  He means it.  Yes, he does.  Get on your knees, scumbag.  Now choke yourself!  Ah, love it.  All right.  With that, we'll take a break.  All righty. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, God.  Well, it'll be what?  This is hilarious.  These guys can't take shit.  It's hilarious.  Who can't?  Uh, who's this?  This is Jeff.  Hey, Jeff.  What's going on?  I was just calling to give you the 411 on Lex and Terry this morning, slamming you again.  I think it's Army time.  God, these guys are...  Don't they understand they're playing right into our hands?  We're a national talk show just trying to get exposure all over the country, and they're  giving us exposure down in Florida, and I guess they're in a few other markets. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm calling from Tampa right now.  You guys want their number?  Are they doing it now, or...?  Well, they just went to commercial.  They got a number, it's called 800-977-DO-US.  800-977-what?  DO-US.  D-O-U-S?  That is it, man.  Yuck.  How naughty.  How naughty.  Oh, they're a sassy one.  Sit the kids in the other room when you put on these firecrackers.  DO-US.  T-E-E-E. 
[02:12:30]  T-E-E-E-E.  What's the matter?  It was 1-900 jizz bags taken?  DO-US.  Wow, these guys can't take anything.  We've slammed them for maybe 15 seconds.  We got a little upset.  And now they're going off on us?  That's perfect for us.  All right, well, let's see what the Army can do today, the O&A Army.  1-800-977-DO-US.  DO-US.  Try not to giggle when you're dialing.  Knocky, knocky radio show.  Hand over mouth.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  What?  Tomorrow they do a bit where they call it Drunk Bitch Friday, where they have this chick in 
[02:13:00]  there, and they get her drunk, like, all day long, or all morning long.  You guys should just pound them tomorrow.  Well, I'm sure that's a really sincere thing.  I'm sure she's really drunk.  Yeah.  If they're really doing it, I got to, you know, if we're going to be honest here, it  sounds like it could be a good bit.  Drunk bitches are always funny.  Yeah, you know.  Well, it is.  Unless you're married to one.  It'd be stupid to sit here and go, wow, that sounds hacky.  It sounds like it has potential.  Yeah, they can't go very far with it, of course, you know, because of the FCC or whatever, 
[02:13:30]  but they take a lot of fun.  You can't rape her.  Yeah, exactly.  Just, guys, again, just pull over before you dial that number.  What is it, 1-900 or 1-800?  1-800.  What a dummy.  I am 1-900.  Who would have a 900 number for a radio station?  1-800-977-DO-US.  Do us.  Do us.  You know, all of us.  Will you shut up?  Jesus, dude, you just.  All right, what were you saying, dude?  I was just saying it's three. 
[02:14:00]  We just shut up.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm not talking to you.  Yeah, we're talking to the caller.  What are you saying?  Yeah, what?  I was just saying the last.  Shut up, dude.  Hold on a second.  I'm trying to get the number out.  1-900, 1-800.  Dude, is it 1-800?  1-800-977-DO-US.  He's talking to me.  Do us.  Tee-hee.  Oh, Lex and Terry.  I don't know what Lex and Terry do.  Just tell them you don't want to listen to them.  They'll understand.  Believe me.  The thing is, this guy still has no idea.  Hold on, what's that, chatty Cathy doll?  I didn't hear you.  The worst.  I was wondering if they had to tie you up every now and then to calm you down. 
[02:14:30]  No, my breathing's been a little off lately.  I'm very concerned about it.  I don't know what it is.  I think it's something with my whatever.  You're a little stressful.  You're a little stressed.  Well, cool.  You guys go on the tag, man.  We'll talk.  It's annoying me.  Oh, he was just nonstop.  But he's a good boy.  1-800.  What?  I'm laughing.  It's funny.  Four letters.  A-I-D-S. 
[02:15:00]  1-800-DO-US.  I don't know, guys.  That's a little naughty.  That is racy.  I don't know.  What if parents hear that with their kids?  You know, because they understand what DO-US means.  Yeah.  Talking about sex.  That's right.  If you're going to get clever with a phone number, that's how you do it.  You just have the number, then it spells out age and let everyone else figure it out eventually.  Well, apparently there's a bunch of unfunny bits, and they screamed out, DO-US.  And that's what that show did.  Fucking hillbillies. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  This is a perfect opportunity to regroup.  Yeah, I got to take a leak.  Ooh, Anthony.  It's very rare that you take a leak.  I know.  Got to go.  Shotgun.  Oh, 1-800-DO-ANT.  Oh, no.  That's five letters.  Who cares?  It's still funny.  Horn beep.  Horn beep.  Who's coming to the bathroom with me?  Me.  Me.  All of us?  Yeah, all of us.  Yeah, let's, uh...  Hog the stall so Ed has to stand at the urinal.  Yeah, Ed doesn't like standing at the urinal.  You bet he doesn't.  Especially when someone's leaning over going, mmm.  That's right. 
[02:16:00]  Making the yummy noise.  Jimmy.  Jimmy gets a little personal.  He sure does.  Nothing wrong with one friend just talking to another friend, walking him through something.  All right.  I think Dee Dee's going to come back in and do some more news for us.  All right.  And, uh, and blah, blah, blah.  We'll figure out what to do in a minute or two here.  Hit that.  Live from Washington, D.C.  On this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we are led to one conclusion.  This place just blows. 
[02:16:30]  You're being harsh.  We will be in the Anthony Show.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program live from Washington, D.C. 
[02:17:00]  It's O.P., it's Ant, it's little Jimmy Norton, and that guy is still on that crane, 18 stories  up.  He climbed up there, uh, uh, uh, yesterday afternoon, right?  We're up to Thursday, right?  No way.  He's been up there since Wednesday afternoon.  No way.  Yeah.  Why aren't they just shooting him down?  I don't know.  He beats his girlfriend to death.  And then, uh, climbs up there, refuses to come down. 
[02:17:30]  Is he throwing feces at the officers?  You see that he's going to, like, run and leap onto a crane that's next to him?  Uh, yeah.  He's throwing his back.  Oh, you see what's going on?  There's an intersection below him, so they're concerned for the guy's safety up on the crane  and people below.  Why don't they just, you know, rope off the area?  And then start shooting at him.  Or maybe have Jim Fowler come in there with some kind of a, uh, some kind of a dart. 
[02:18:00]  A dart that's good.  Bender him unconscious?  Yeah.  Get the crocodile hunter.  Is he still around?  Yeah.  I think after that bomb of a movie he made, he went and hid.  Well, ma'am, I'm a national treasure.  Oh, yeah.  That was good.  Hey, John in Iowa, what's up?  Hey, I wanted you to hear these tool bags in Davenport.  Oh, all right.  We're doing a little of this today, Anthony.  Might as well.  Listen in on radio shows.  See how good they are.  All right.  Are you ready?  Yeah, we're going to Iowa.  Well, I think I've changed my mind. 
[02:18:30]  I don't believe I'm going to do this.  All right.  It doesn't sound legit.  Well, ma'am, what should I tell the party?  He sounds like...  Just tell him I don't believe...  I don't believe that's who's calling.  That's what you can tell him.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So, Mr. Tom Selleck, I will tell him that Doris will not accept the charges.  Because I don't believe that that's actually who it is.  All right.  I mean, the money he's got, he would be calling Collect.  Yeah, I don't know what he...  He didn't tell me why he's calling Collect, although he made it pretty clear that he needed to speak to you. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, well...  Would you like me to put him through?  No, I don't believe so.  Thank you.  All righty, then.  Shoot, I shouldn't have said anything.  Ten cents a minute.  He's not going to risk it.  And then she decided...  No way!  You know, and the worst part about that is now no one is going to be able to hear my dead-on Tom Selleck.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, what the heck.  Sarah, she was all ready to go, but then...  Did you hear any of that? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Did you understand their stupid bit?  Yeah, basically, you got Tom Selleck calling Collect to talk to somebody.  Some idiot.  Right?  And then you...  And hopefully the person will accept the charges and then...  Right.  Oh, my God.  And it has to be their grandma.  They're calling their grandma.  Oh, they're calling their grandma?  Right.  She won't sue.  Oh, there you go.  You call your own relatives and they're not mine, too.  Because Iowa, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What show was this, Brilliance on? 
[02:20:00]  They're called Dwyer and Michael.  So they used to be on 97X, and then they went to a clear channel, I think, and they just suck dick now.  That sounds pretty funny, though, man.  Like, because I like...  Here's what I like.  When a bit bombs and nothing happens, then you go off the air and you discuss all the funny things that could have happened, and you fake laugh at it.  Right.  Yeah.  That would have been really great.  Shucks.  Happy Darn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got a stupid cut sitting in with them every day, too.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:20:30]  Jesus, man.  All right.  Let's calm down, my God.  I know.  What did he just say?  I don't know.  We're pretty much one of a handful of shows that don't have a female co-host.  Oh, oh.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're a female news person.  Did I say...  Unless we're in Washington with Dee Dee.  What?  Oh, is that Dee Dee?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's Dee Dee.  Oh, hi, Dee Dee.  Hi.  I J-O'd you yesterday, baby.  Did you really?  Yeah.  And right when Jim was getting ready to drop a log, I caught it in my mouth. 
[02:21:00]  Okay.  I'll punch it out.  He's got pizzazz.  Yeah, we like John.  He's got spunk.  All right.  See you, guys.  Bye, fella.  Bye.  Thanks for that wacky radio alert or whatever there.  All right, A.  That's pretty funny, though, because Tom Sella...  Can you imagine, guys, like, all kidding aside, if Tom Sella called you?  I mean, the laugh possibilities are just endless.  Why would you do the whole will you accept the charges and act like an operator?  Why don't you, if you do such a great Tom Sella, just get right into the bit? 
[02:21:30]  This is Tom Sella, and I want to talk to Doris.  Right.  You want a contest.  Accept the charges.  But he doesn't even get to the actual bit, which is to do his Tom Sella to a stranger and see if they buy it.  Like, I do a really funny thing where sometimes I'll go home, and I do a great Jim from Taxi, and I'll ask people if they have Prince Albert in a can.  And when they say yes, I'll just go, oh, and then hang on.  And just get big laughs.  That's great.  Everybody has, like, real genuine laughs.  1-800-DO-US. 
[02:22:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You nuts.  Those guys are incorrigible.  I don't know who's worse.  Terry or Lex.  Lex or Terry.  Who knows?  I don't even know if a Terry is cock or a breasts.  Yeah, what is it?  What is Terry?  Is it an I-T-E-R-R-I or Y?  I don't know if it's a guy, girls.  Guy and a girl, probably.  Probably.  The one sensible, smart one and the one wacky fella.  Right.  All right, Dee Dee, you want to do some more news?  Sure.  Maybe real news this time?  Hey, I had, like, a Rob Lowe story, and I did good before, right? 
[02:22:30]  You tricked us with the Rob Lowe.  I know.  Well, you.  All right, how about Stanton Island Animal Shelter?  What?  Animal Shelter?  It's about an animal shelter.  It's Stanton Island.  Wait, what the hell is that?  What?  Nothing, sorry.  I don't know.  What the?  Somebody hit a button.  Okay, there you go.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  Okay, Stanton Island.  An animal shelter begins killing kittens.  What?  Okay, we see. 
[02:23:00]  What?  All right.  Hold on, I was just laughing because they're making faces in the other room.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Okay, can you start again?  You asses, stop with that.  Okay, go ahead, Dee Dee.  I'm sorry, Dee Dee.  Go ahead.  Yeah, just start over.  We're looking in here.  I know.  Dee Dee with the news, everybody.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  The last few months of Stanton Island Animal Shelter has been trying to find homes for all  the kittens that come in there.  Why are you laughing?  No reason.  You make Steve sound like boss. 
[02:23:30]  Well, Steve is jumping up and down making goofy faces.  I'm sorry.  He's trying to distract the show, so.  Nothing.  I didn't hear.  First of all, they're all laughing.  I didn't hear where this took place or what was happening.  All right, I'm sorry.  Something about animals.  What's the story?  It's in Brooklyn, something about animals.  Yes.  Where was it?  Steve, stop.  Okay.  I was told to stay at the island.  Okay.  All right.  And you're right.  You have the news story.  I don't.  All right.  I didn't even hear that because I was telling Steve to stop.  All right.  So why don't we start again here?  Why don't we make believe nothing happened yet?  Okay.  Here we go.  I'm with the news. 
[02:24:00]  Okay.  All right.  Sandin Island.  Animal.  Why is that so funny?  Dude.  Nothing.  I know.  Anyway, there's an animal shelter that's killing kittens.  Because I live on Long Island.  All right.  Is that where that was?  No, it's not Long Island.  You're not on Long Island, dude.  Where was it?  I'm not going to say.  Anyway, the last few months, this animal shelter has been trying to find homes for all the kittens  that come in there.  It's not funny.  And because they can't find homes, many cute kittens are going to be turned into General 
[02:24:30]  Sal's chicken.  Why are you laughing?  And why are they going to be turned into General...  Because they're at full capacity, so they have to do it.  So come on, people.  Go get a kitten.  Don't let them die.  A kitten?  A kitten?  I can't even...  Listen.  They're going to kill them because they're at full capacity.  They only kill kittens when...  He's mocking me.  I'm not mocking you.  You're not.  He's a kitten.  That's the way you say it whenever there's a hard T sound. 
[02:25:00]  Do you prefer Brooklyn or Manhattan?  Brooklyn.  Have you ever been in Manhattan?  Nope.  Okay.  You're trying to get me to say Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Damn it.  Do you like Manhattan or Australia?  Australia.  Because they have an accent.  Do you like wearing the gloves with all the fingers or those other things where it's just  the thumb?  Yeah.  What do they call that?  I forgot.  What's the word, D.D.?  You cover your thumb and then the other four fingers? 
[02:25:30]  You know, you wear them in the winter.  Gloves?  No.  Oh, the one in one.  Mittens.  All right.  Any more?  Mittens.  Mittens.  For kittens.  Yes.  In Staten Island.  Staten Island and mittens.  You have to...  There's a...  It's just a very hard T sound, which we like.  Actually, you pronounce it properly.  It just sounds weird.  It's because I'm from the Midwest, Chicago.  No, I know you're from Chicago.  That's where they say kittens.  Kittens.  Kittens.  Smite my kittens. 
[02:26:00]  Kittens.  Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Clitoring.  Clitoring.  Okay.  So, yeah.  So, go get a kitten so they don't cry.  All right.  Get a kitten.  Yes.  If you know what that is, go get one.  It's a cat.  A little cat.  Okay.  All right.  So, for the ten people listening to us in Staten Island, they're all going to run out.  No, there's no.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Okay.  See how to say it, Jimmy.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  St-  St-  Yeah, Staten Island.  Staten Island. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  My tongue goes the other way.  Staten.  Staten.  It's like whenever there's a T like there, like Manhattan or Staten, you usually say Manhattan  or Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Or kitten.  Kitten.  Instead of kitten.  No one says Staten Island.  Or kitten.  Manhattan is awful, too.  I guess I got it from Jelliot, Illinois.  How do you say Jim Norton?  Jim Norton.  Okay.  See, that's right.  You have like a N sound in Norton.  You don't hard the T.  Jim Norton. 
[02:27:00]  I didn't even realize the word ten was in the word kitten until just now.  Kitten.  Kitten.  Staten.  Staten.  All right.  I can't help it.  Sorry.  Oh, it's all right.  It's okay, DeeDee.  You're adorable.  Let's go.  Um, okay.  There's some parents who can't teach their child to be a witch.  Yep.  Two divorced Indianapolis parents can't upset the...  Indianapolis.  Home of Bob and Tom, right?  Ew.  Right?  Right.  You're not supposed to say that you're in Indianapolis when you're in their studio,  apparently.  That you're not supposed to tell anybody that they are based out of Indianapolis. 
[02:27:30]  Apparently, it's a big secret.  Ooh.  Why?  I don't know.  I didn't mean let the kitten out of the bag.  Okay.  Oh, because they want people from wherever they're, you know, being heard to feel like  they are in our town.  Right.  They're local.  They're a local show for us.  Uh-huh.  Ugh.  Another stupid thing that a programmer tries to teach you.  Really?  Try to make yourself sound local.  My former PD.  Right?  He used to say that shit?  He said it all the time. 
[02:28:00]  He said that's the reason why we'll, like, beat X-Time and Sirius, because we're going  to be local, local, local.  Oh, he drilled that into our heads.  Every program.  Whoever he is, I hope he's killed in a drunk driving accident.  I will not say it's me, but...  Why not?  As a program director, you're not insulting him.  That is just stupid.  His initials are JW.  Ooh.  Is there an E in between them?  No.  Yeah.  No, he's not.  All right.  So, witches doing what to their kids or something?  The parents can't teach their child to be a witch.  Two divorced Indianapolis parents are upset that they can no longer expose their son to Wicca. 
[02:28:30]  And the man and his ex-wife are pissed about the judge's order to not expose their son  to any alternate religion.  So, they're really mad about that.  They're not allowed to?  And they're currently...  It's under a pill right now.  Well, is it because it's in the stock...  Did she say under a pill?  A pill!  I said not a pill.  I said a pill.  How the hell did you get under a pill?  I didn't say a pill.  Yeah.  You did.  You did.  Yeah, you did a little bit. 
[02:29:00]  Okay, well, I didn't mean to.  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Why can't they be exposed to Wicca?  Well, you know what?  They should be able to because...  Are you wicked for how I say Wicca now?  You say Wicca, right?  I can actually hear both C's when she says it.  Wicca.  Wicca.  Wicca.  I can't help it.  That's okay.  You're doing a fine job.  Definitely.  Any other news?  Yeah.  All right.  How about dog food makes for a shitty diet?  This is a good one.  Old people, listen up.  In Milan, a family figured out why their fat son was not losing weight after they put him 
[02:29:30]  on a diet.  The kid had been eating the dog's food.  He was only caught after the family pet bit him in the ass.  And the fat little bastard was tipping the scales at 70 kilograms,  which is 155 pounds, if you didn't know that.  Ah, who cares?  And the dad thought the dog was getting thin but did not bother to investigate.  No.  That kid should have gasoline poured on him.  He needed dog food, I guess, because he was hungry.  Wow, this is just like listening to CNN when Dee Dee does the news. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Hey.  All right.  Why go to the Fox News channel when you've got Dee Dee giving you the same story?  The scoop.  Jesus.  Did you get the story about the 86-year-old woman in Charlotte, North Carolina?  No.  No?  What do you tell me?  Ah, she was jailed after police said she called emergency dispatchers 20 times  in a little more than a half hour, all to complain that a pizza parlor wouldn't deliver.  This old relic called 911 20 times. 
[02:30:30]  When the cops came to arrest her, she fought and bit and scratched them?  Yes.  She's like 90 pounds?  We're trying to get the audio.  How old is she?  86.  Oh, my gosh.  She's just nuts, though.  Someone like that is just a bonafide nut.  She's crazy, yeah.  She's an old lady.  She's nuts.  She, when the police officers arrived at her apartment, the five-foot-tall, 98-pound woman  attacked the officer, scratching him, kicking him, and bit his hand.  Wow.  Oh, you know, a chopper's probably popped out on his hand, all drooly. 
[02:31:00]  Ugh.  His hand still smells.  Ugh.  Her plaque.  Like baby powder and efferent.  Old lady mouth.  It should smell like fist.  That cop should have put on a glove and just caved her teeth in with his fist.  All 90 pounds of her.  That's a cute little story.  That is a cute little story.  I would love to hear those 911 calls.  She's not as bad, though, as the younger people that do it, because you're 86.  You're obviously a nut.  She's insane.  She's a nut, yeah.  She's just, I mean, she should just be killed. 
[02:31:30]  The Alzheimer's.  That's what I was just going to say.  It was probably that.  What?  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  What?  I think she's right, actually.  I think you're right.  And then say, I said it right.  How do you say it?  Say it first, though.  No, say it.  Say it.  Say it.  You might be right.  Alzheimer's.  You're right.  You're actually right.  He said it right.  He actually pronounces the Z just because of the Z in the word.  How do you say it?  I'm not going to repeat it.  Why?  You're right.  No, you really are right this time, Judy.  Go ahead.  No, no, because you're fucking with me right now.  No, no, not at all.  Alzheimer's. 
[02:32:00]  Alzheimer's.  Fine.  All right.  All right.  Any other stories there?  Me or him?  You.  Oh, okay, yeah.  You were looking at him.  You were looking at him.  Whenever there's a Z in a word, I just drop it.  I just remove that Z.  There's no need for it.  Let's go to the O.  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Anyway, Nebraska states are for me.  It's a news group I go to.  Alt.heimers.  .sex.  You ever go to the O, look at the animals, or listen to 100?  Go to the O. 
[02:32:30]  All-timers?  Okay, Nebraska.  I'm going to talk about Nebraska.  I'm done with that.  I saw a T-bra at the O.  I said Nebraska with an N.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're good at saying Nebraska.  All right.  Nebraska states attorney, sorry for making comments about a molested boy.  Attorney General for Nebraska, John Bruning's office, is in hot water for...  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  You will be molested.  Oh, that's bad. 
[02:33:00]  He made about a nine-year-old boy who was allegedly molested while under the state's care.  The attorney's office claimed the mother was at fault for the abuse since the child had to be removed from her care.  That's just fucked up.  The judge prevented this defense from occurring, and Bruning's office has since apologized.  I mean, yeah, that's kind of like, you know, blaming a radio show when a reporter is fired.  Well, if the mother had been a better mother, the kid never would have been molested.  Right.  That's wrong.  And I have another story. 
[02:33:30]  My last story is for Jim.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Okay.  Police in Peoria...  That's Richard Pryor's hometown, by the way.  It's near my hometown.  Peoria.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Pryor's hometown.  New Julia.  Okay.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck...  No, Peoria.  Yeah.  You didn't say Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Whatever.  God.  Yeah, Tin Island and Peoria.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck dumbfounded by the first...  In Illinois? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, Illinois.  Okay.  It's Illinois.  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Who cares about the eyes?  To me, as far as she's concerned.  Oh, damn it.  You're right.  Ellen.  Illinois.  Yeah.  Do you like the elephants in the ooze?  Elephants.  Elephants.  All right.  All right.  Let's start over.  From the top?  Yeah, because...  Yeah, we don't have to know that.  We have ADD.  Go ahead.  All right.  ADD.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck dumbfounded by the first prostitution case in  the area.  So I thought you'd like this. 
[02:34:30]  Yes.  A 47-year-old Christian school teacher thought her snatch was worth $200.  Yep.  She advertised in an escort ad and was caught by police in her love nest apartment.  And a spokesperson stated that $200 should buy you a hot, young call girl in a posh hotel.  So I thought you'd like that prostitution.  I do.  Prior's mother, funny bit of trivia, was a prostitute.  That's right.  Yeah.  She was a call girl in Peoria, and his grandmother was a madam.  No.  Peoria?  Yeah, Peoria, Illinois. 
[02:35:00]  Yes, that's why.  Peoria.  All right.  Matt from Nebraska has a question for DD.  Matt.  Yo.  Oh, God.  What's up, Matt?  Hi, Matt.  Hey, DD.  I was wondering, are you wearing satin panties or cotton panties?  What type do you wear?  Yeah, do you wear the satin or the...  You just thought you'd say the T.  Or the cotton or cotton.  Do you like cotton or satin?  I wear both.  Which do you prefer?  Well, it depends.  Like, if I'm out, you know, on a date, the satin. 
[02:35:30]  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Okay, good.  That is really hard to say.  You like satin.  And then for just hanging around, you might use the what?  Cotton.  Cotton.  Cotton and satin?  What a chore to speak.  Cotton.  How do you say satin, Reg?  You say it.  Satin.  God, we all have accents.  We know that.  But you just amaze us with yours.  How do you say satin?  Satan.  Satan.  Satan is a devil. 
[02:36:00]  Satan.  Satan.  Satan.  All right.  Okay.  Satin.  Give me an Ocon.  Okay.  Very good.  Well, that's satin.  Proper pronunciation.  You want to do one of these sex advice things while Dee Dee's in the studio?  Sure.  Sue Johansson.  Oh, Dr. Sue Johansson from Oxygen Channel.  She's a trip.  Oh, you know her?  Yes.  You like her?  She plays with, like, those two dolls.  The blue doll and the red doll.  The blue doll's for the boy and the red doll's for the girl.  Really? 
[02:36:30]  She, like, does these positions.  She's a trip.  I've only heard clips of her.  I haven't seen the show.  Oh, my God.  Oxygen Channel.  Yeah, I don't even know what that is on my cable provider.  It's not supposed to be hilarious, though, is it?  Right next to the soap shell channel.  It's funny because she told one guy.  I'll save it.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Okay.  One day this guy called up about butt plugs and she said, try it while you're vacuuming.  What?  What?  What?  I just thought that was funny.  That's terrific. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  She told the guy to just try it out while he was vacuuming.  You sure she wasn't talking about butt plug removal?  No, she...  I tried the vacuum.  No, she said, try it out while you're vacuuming.  You may like it.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  And you love this show, huh?  Maybe it's for women.  You know what?  It's funny.  I think it's hilarious.  I think it stinks.  I would like to get through and ask her, I don't know, come up with this.  What would you want to ask her?  I don't know.  Yeah, what would you ask Sue Johansson? 
[02:37:30]  I think you do know.  The grandma that gives out sex advice.  I don't know what I would ask her, but it would be fun to get through to her and just  make up something.  What would you make up?  I'm sure if you're on the phone, you have to think on the fly.  You've thought about this.  No, I haven't.  Yes, you have.  No, I haven't.  You should do sex advice with Dee Dee.  It's not a bad idea.  Dee Dee's a pervert.  Dee Dee is a little filthy pervert.  I'm not a pervert just because I like the whip.  You like to be whipped and have nipple clamps and cock rings.  You are a filthy girl.  You're a dirty girl.  Okay, and who has hookers?  Oh, I'm awful. 
[02:38:00]  I know I'm awful.  I love these two, man.  There's something going on here.  I know.  Actually, somebody did send me an email.  I have to forward it to you guys because he photoshopped mine and it's a place.  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  Of you two going at it?  Well, like we're getting married or something and it probably come out.  See, you guys, you two definitely live in the same world.  Yes, we do.  And you both know it.  That's what I love about what I see going on here.  I don't think there's any real attraction here, but you could both.  Oh, I know what Dee Dee wants.  I know what Dee Dee wants. 
[02:38:30]  You guys can relate to each other.  What do I want, Jim?  Dee Dee wants a good bottom red knee.  Yeah.  She knows I'd redden her bottom properly.  She knows it.  Of course she knows it.  How could she not know it?  She likes getting that ass slapped.  Of course she does.  But not by everybody.  Oh, I know that.  But she understands I'd spank her properly.  Dee Dee definitely understands it.  Would you let Jimmy spank you properly?  She understands what I would do.  I'd slide the panties down a little bit.  You know, you spank him.  No, you just make sure.  This is what you do.  And you part the thighs a little bit gently and you make sure the person's not getting wet.  If the person's getting wet, you spank them harder because... 
[02:39:00]  Because that's a no-no.  And they know they're not supposed to get wet and they get wetter.  It's just a reality.  Wow, Jimmy.  Maybe you slap the...  He's into it.  You know he is.  He knows a lot about it.  That's the truth.  You make sure that you tell them, don't...  Do not get, you know...  And that makes them get wetter, right, Dee Dee?  Of course it does.  You pull the panties tight.  She's trying to fan herself right now.  She knows it's true that you hold the panties.  The first panties, you pull them tight between the lips.  Not too hard.  Just a little bit of pressure, you know?  Is that true, Dee Dee?  Of course it's true. 
[02:39:30]  Sure.  Oh, stupid Regis.  I guess the winner of the contender is on.  Yeah.  So Regis comes out with the boxing robe on and the boxing gloves.  Oh, there's a guy in the crane.  And now he's going to duke it out with him a little bit.  Uh-huh.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, there's a guy with the crane.  That's a research lab that they're testing out things on a chimpanzee.  I just looked at the TV.  When you look fast, what can I tell you?  Look at the cartoon thing that he doesn't show.  I just want to see Regis get his ass kicked. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Well, we can play a clip from Sue Johansson here, Anthony.  Talk Sex with Sue Johansson.  It's on the Oxygen channel.  She's a grandma, and she's just awful with her advice.  But Dee Dee seems to like it.  You've got to watch her.  It's seeing her play with the dolls.  All right.  Let's listen to this bit of advice.  Hey.  What's up?  Hi, Brianna.  How are you?  I'm fine.  Good.  You've got a question.  Yes.  I'm 18 years old.  Yeah?  And I've just noticed I'm hornier than a lot of my friends. 
[02:40:30]  Is this normal?  And is it okay to masturbate with baby oil?  Yep.  Yes and yes.  Okay.  Now, masturbation for females.  I mean, you're 18.  I'm sorry it took you 18 years to learn how to do it.  No, I did it a long time ago.  When did she get the idea that it took her that long?  She just said she's 18 and she masturbates.  She didn't say, I just started.  She said she has that owl disease.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  Owl's disease.  She's got the owl's disease.  Oh, Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Right.  Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Whatever.  I'm saying it fast now.  Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Okay.  Say it.  It's alts.  Whatever.  Yeah.  That's exactly it.  All right.  No, I did it a long time ago.  Okay.  Well, then that's good.  It's fine.  Now, when you masturbate, do you pleasure yourself?  Do you reach orgasm?  Oh.  Yes.  Oh, good.  All right.  That's real good. 
[02:41:30]  Now, and you're worried about what?  Now, I might get sick if I use baby oil because I'm too ashamed to go buy the regular stuff.  Now, you know what?  The trouble with baby oil is that it has perfume in it, you know?  It smells nice, and baby oil, you can get, some women develop an allergic reaction to  the baby oil because it's got the perfume in it.  So, why don't you go to any drugstore, any drugstore at all, and pick up a bottle of ordinary 
[02:42:00]  garden variety lubricant.  They're not that expensive.  They'll last you forever and ever.  And you just open the top up and squish them on your hands and use that for lubrication  rather than baby oil.  Baby oil smells nice, but that's a problem because it's got perfume.  Okay, Brianna?  Good. 
[02:42:30]  I'm glad we got your call in because that was obviously something that was worrying you.  That is awful advice.  She said she's embarrassed.  It's obvious advice.  Yeah.  Dee Dee?  It wasn't bad advice.  The girl is afraid that, you know, she was embarrassed.  She doesn't want to go to the drugstore, though, and pick up lube.  That's why she uses the baby oil.  She just needs to get over that and go get.  And it all depends if she's still living at home with the parents.  You can't have KY around in your house.  If there's baby oil around, then, you know, it's baby oil. 
[02:43:00]  It could be used for anything.  Right.  But the perfume thing is a good point, though.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  People can be allergic to perfumes.  Yeah.  What?  Perfumes.  Perfumes.  Perfumes.  No, you're right.  I mean, because perfumes have definitely perfumes.  Oh, God!  I actually agree with you.  You're absolutely right.  Because a lot of times, unscented things are fine, but if you're going to put perfumes in  something, then you absolutely should just put the accent wherever you feel it goes.  The way the rest of the country pronounces something is irrelevant. 
[02:43:30]  You know?  I can't help it.  Sorry.  Say it again.  That's not different.  No, you don't.  I'm secure with my speech impediment now, man.  Absolutely.  You guys should have the kids together.  You're a mess.  Your tongue's a mess.  Are you going to put perfumes in?  What?  Perfume.  Perfume.  Perfume.  Yeah.  You're something like a cartoon speeding by voice.  Perfume.  Let's go to dugout Doug from Whack Bag.  What's up, Doug?  Hi, Doug.  Good morning, fellas. 
[02:44:00]  Good morning, DeeDee.  Good morning, Doug.  I love you.  I love your show.  I am my kid's mom.  I have a question for you.  For me or for them?  I have a question for you, DeeDee.  I have a sex advice question for you.  Oh, okay.  Oh, God.  Well, you see, due to the increased sensitivity during the menstrual cycle, I do enjoy very  much crime scene sex.  During that time, usually, when you pull out, you get like a flaky consistency mixed with 
[02:44:30]  blood chunks.  Ew.  This last time when I was doing it, when I pulled out, it was more like a blood-soaked  rice pudding.  Ew.  Oh, God.  That's just wrong.  I was wondering if that was quite possibly a yeast infection at the same time.  Oh, good question.  I don't know.  Ew.  DeeDee, you into the crime scene sex?  No.  Ew.  Good girl.  Ew.  Where you have to put a tarp down?  No.  No?  Yuck.  Yuck.  I will not do it while I'm on my Aunt Flo. 
[02:45:00]  No.  You don't need that all over satin sheets, right?  Yeah.  You're going to have sex.  I got tinned.  So, what do you do when you're having your flow?  Well, duh, anal, probably.  Wow.  Of course.  Well, of course, Anthony.  Thank God.  Most people say nothing.  Stupid me, right?  Yeah.  I just take my doll and relax.  But apparently, you know, the asshole's door is open.  Well, if I'm with the guy and he really, really wants something, well, that's all he's  going to get while I'm on my flow.  Jesus, DeeDee. 
[02:45:30]  That must be a lovely scene.  Wow.  Blood dripping.  Like you're just hanging in the back door.  No, because if you have a tampon on, it's not going to drip.  You're right.  All right.  Well.  You're right.  Well.  I'm just, I mean, you know, it's not going to drip.  You know, I have to.  I just picture if you flip over on your belly and your most intimate is kind of laying there  on the sheets, bleeding.  Does it look like a boxer freshly knocked out?  Like, you know how the mouth kind of is open a little and the little blood is coming out? 
[02:46:00]  It's kind of looking down there.  And sometimes the cut man does, you know, throw some cotton and stuff in the mouth.  Yeah, that's true.  To stop the bleeding.  Some of that cotton starts hanging out a little bit.  You're there with your face in the pillow, your keister up in the air.  Oh, nice.  Keister.  I found myself recently in a supermarket in the tampon section.  And, man, you girls have a lot of choices for tampons, I noticed. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  I got to come in with the list of the choices for you girls.  You want me to go through the list?  Oh, you know the list?  I don't know.  Okay.  I know there was one.  Kotex.  No, no, no, no, but there were certain ones like Gentle Glide.  Oh, yeah, the plastic Gentle Glide.  Why?  Wouldn't your choices end there if you're a woman and you're looking for a tampon?  You want it to be gentle and to glide.  You want it gentle and, yeah, you want it to glide in nice.  What other choices could there possibly be that are going to beat out the Gentle Glide? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, what's another popular sell?  The sandpaper fish hook?  No, there's just, like, there's cardboard ones, too, which is why they still make them.  I don't know.  It looks like a push-up, one of those push-up pops things.  It does.  Yeah, it's a cardboard tube.  But they have those marketing words.  I'll have to do my research over the weekend and I'll come in with a whole list.  You do that.  Research that over this weekend, Opie.  Well, just because some of them were hilarious, I can't remember anymore, but one was Gentle  Glide.  And I'm thinking if you're a woman, that's...  Playtex, I think, yeah. 
[02:47:30]  But what are some of the other ones?  Like extra...  There's, like...  Extra crispy?  What?  No, you mean for the different, like, if you're moderate, if you're heavy?  It's stuff like that.  Oh, my God, dude.  It was...  It was like...  It was...  There's a lot.  There's...  It made me dizzy.  Yeah.  You think there's a lot of choices for cereal in the supermarket these days?  Oh, my God.  There's wings, too, on the...  On the pads.  On the pads.  The wings, they wrap around the panties and keep them from flowing over the edge.  Oh, is that what that's winged mean?  Yeah.  I never investigated that.  Oh, sure. 
[02:48:00]  You put the...  You lay the pad on the panty and then the wings, like, stick underneath, kind of on the side.  So, no leakage spills on the side.  Well, now, what...  Let me ask.  You were saying heavy.  What do they do with a heavy flow?  It's like a certain...  It's just a larger tampon.  Does it come with, like, a little string and a needle?  Not a string and a needle.  Oh, God.  A thread.  I just think it's funny that you're talking about wings.  Wings.  Flying on the wings of a maxi.  Sew it up.  Looks like a catcher's lid.  Have you ever allowed a guy to get... 
[02:48:30]  Especially stuffed turkey.  Oh, God.  Have you ever allowed a guy to get his red wings?  No.  No?  No.  It goes down on you.  It looks like he's been drinking grape juice.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I told you.  I don't like that when I...  No.  No.  When Amplo's visiting, no.  Or it looks like he's stuck his face in a cherry pie.  Oh, God.  You look like a victim of the Jonestown Massacre.  You're just laying there, drugged out, and Kool-Aid on your face.  No.  No.  And you'd prefer to be one? 
[02:49:00]  No.  You'd rather just flip it over.  No.  That's one thing I've never done, and I probably won't.  Wow.  Never let a guy do it during that.  No.  I don't blame you.  Good for you.  But you'll roll over on your belly.  That's right.  If someone has a very good question for Dee Dee, let me go to...  Let's see.  Andy in New York City.  Hi, Andy.  Andy.  Andy.  Yeah.  Andy.  Andy.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  How are you, sweet tits?  Hi, Mr. Let's not...  Let's keep the insults out. 
[02:49:30]  I'm sorry.  Dee Dee, I have a sex question for you.  I was wondering if you like the trifecta, going from the front to the rear right to the mouth.  Oh, good question.  Dee Dee, are you into the ass-to-mouth, the trifecta?  No.  You don't do ass-to-mouth?  No.  No, if it's down there...  No, it's a little weird.  It's got to be cleaned off before, you know...  Oh, hell yeah.  It's got to go from the reverse.  You've got to start with the mouth, then vag, then the back door. 
[02:50:00]  Right.  No, Jimmy, if you do it the other way.  I have Jimmy.  Yeah, you're right.  I'm saying for hygienic purposes.  Right.  But if you do it the original way, you call the triple crown.  I'm not saying you're wrong in theory, sir.  I'm not saying the humiliation factor isn't sexy and hilarious.  I'm just saying...  Punch it out, boys.  Bye, Mr. Nice.  Let's go to Michigan.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Hey.  Love the show.  Hey, it's sweet kids.  Hi, fella.  Hey. 
[02:50:30]  We call that a chili dog when you go from the ass.  Oh, God.  That's what we refer to as a chili dog.  A buddy of mine's got a girl that just loves that.  What's a chili dog, exactly?  Oh, you put it in her backside, and then you pull it out and put it in her mouth.  Right.  Jesus.  And put it in her mouth.  It's a chili dog.  Can you not say it?  You got a mission from God?  That's awful.  A mission from God.  And then you put it in the mouth.  Put it in her mouth. 
[02:51:00]  The sisters of mercy.  How you do it?  Cool.  All right.  One more here, and then we'll go back to Sue Johansson.  Ben in Pennsylvania.  Ben?  Ben.  Good morning, boys.  What's up?  Where?  Hey.  That old brother.  Who is this?  K-S-S.  What was the...  Who is this?  Oh, Adande.  Adande.  Go ahead, Ben.  Hey.  That old brother was giving the advice.  Did she actually ask that girl if she masturbates to go to orgasm? 
[02:51:30]  Who on planet Earth doesn't masturbate to go to orgasm?  Oh, my God.  You'll spend the whole afternoon until you reach your goal.  You've got to finish up.  Punch it out.  All right.  You'll be chafed beyond recognition as long as you get to the end there.  All right.  Let's do another one from Sue Johansson.  The magical sperm she talks about here, Anthony.  Magical.  Magical.  Yes.  My husband tells me that sperm is good for my hair. 
[02:52:00]  Is this true?  Samantha.  Yes.  Yeah.  No.  It's not?  You know what?  That's the first time I've ever heard that line.  I have heard a lot of lines about the wonderful fringe.  You know what, though?  Yeah.  We did a whole bit a few years back.  There was a shampoo that came out that had sperm in it.  That's some kind of sperm.  And they claimed that made the shampoo better.  Yeah.  What the hell was the name of that shampoo? 
[02:52:30]  It was legit and everything.  Bob.  Oh, man.  We had fun with that, remember?  Mm.  All right.  Whatever.  Let's go back.  About the wonderful fringe benefits of ejaculate.  And one of them is that if you rub it on your face, it'll clear up your acne.  Ew.  If you swallow it, it'll give you big boobs.  I have heard that if you swallow it, it will eliminate menstrual cramps.  Make you a good girl. 
[02:53:00]  I have heard that it's diet food because there's only 35 calories in one teaspoon.  But I have never heard that it'll make your hair shine and look lustrous.  Otherwise, you know what?  Our pubic hair would be, oh, just glistening.  I don't think so, Samantha.  All right.  Thank you.  Nice try, though.  Shut up.  You've got to give him credit for innovation.  All right?  Yes.  Okay. 
[02:53:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye.  That's the jack in her hair.  He probably shot it in her hair and she complained.  And he went, ah, it's good for your hair.  Don't worry.  It's fine.  No, I heard one thing.  I don't know if it's true.  I heard that there's, like, protein in it.  Yes, that's true.  And it's good, like, when you do swallow it.  That's what I was told a long time ago.  Do you?  I don't know if that's true.  What do you do with it?  You spit?  No, you swallow.  She obviously swallows.  Well, I have to know the guy.  Oh, please.  Oh, stop.  Seriously.  If you don't know him, what, do you just spit it back in his face?  Right out the car window? 
[02:54:00]  I don't, yeah.  Only with certain guys I would do that.  Only certain guys?  Do you ever, like, hang out and spit out the window and almost get your head cut off by  some random cable?  No.  Do you take it on the face?  I'm not going to answer that.  No.  That's a yes.  No.  It's a no.  We fell right into our trap.  That's a yes.  Whenever anyone says, I'm not going to answer that, that means the answer is yes.  No.  I'll bet you Dee Dee likes to have, like, a man getting ready to finish and her arms being  pinned down by her side while he straddles her shoulders and chest. 
[02:54:30]  So you have that feeling of helplessness, and then he just kind of gives it to you.  God damn, he's good.  Yeah, you guys live in the same world.  I'm going to say it again.  I see it.  It's so obvious.  Because you're nodding like, yeah, yeah, exactly, Jim.  Exactly.  Well, he's right.  I'm like, holy shit.  You got those cute glasses on.  You ever let a guy finish on the glasses and then you're like, oh, I can't see, I can't  see.  I don't wear glasses while I'm having sex.  A little bukkake.  Pukakey.  Pukakey. 
[02:55:00]  That's it.  All right.  Well, now we have, this is a very interesting contrast we have going on today.  We have the sex advice from the grandma, Sue Johansson, and then we got our callers calling  in to ask Dee Dee's sex questions.  Todd, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Dee Dee.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  I wanted to ask Dee Dee if there's anything special that she does to prepare herself  for an evening of anal pleasures. 
[02:55:30]  Dee Dee?  That's a very good question.  It certainly is.  Do you prep for anal?  Anima?  Well, so it's not a sore?  Yeah, sure.  I guess.  Yeah.  Toy?  You start with a toy?  Yeah.  What kind of stuff do you do?  Yeah.  How do you prep?  Yeah, how do you prep for the anal there, Dee Dee?  I can't.  You know you're going to have anal tonight.  What do you do that's a little special?  What do you do?  Besides, turn every family photo around backwards.  You stay away from White Castle for a couple days? 
[02:56:00]  I mean, what do you do?  That's all you need to have sliders in your pubes.  Jesus.  Your crotch smells like a drunk's car at four in the morning on a Saturday.  I don't know if I do anything special.  It's just annoying.  There's a burger place in New York.  We've talked about it, I guess, but what the hell is the name of it?  These burgers don't last more than 20 minutes in New York.  Oh, God.  They're one of the best burgers ever.  They're all over Manhattan.  Greasy.  Like in Jersey, it's the White Rose system.  It's called.  It's just like those awful things. 
[02:56:30]  Jackson Hole.  Jackson Hole burgers.  Thanks, Ann.  And you take that first bite, and you just feel your stomach already percolating.  Yeah.  It's like, boah.  But they're great, right?  They're phenomenal.  They're amazing.  And I always, the first time I went in there, I wondered why there was a line to the bathroom.  And I found out.  They're actually handing you burgers while you're shitting.  Right.  There you go.  Chew.  I mean, White Castle's pretty bad, but these Jackson Hole burgers, you can get them like  200 different ways.  They have every version of the burger imaginable, and these things do not stay in you whatsoever. 
[02:57:00]  But anyway, back to Deedee.  Deedee, how do you prepare the back door for the anal?  You mean so I'm like, no, it's coming?  Mentally, physically.  Mentally.  You clean up.  You try to think it isn't possible that dead relatives are watching you.  What?  That what?  You don't think of your grandparents watching you?  I've always thought of that.  Dropping in from heaven.  Oh, God.  Let me see what.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  She's got her face in a pillow. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  My grandma would have a heartache.  It's in her ass.  Weird.  Weird.  Right.  Why is she putting it through?  Oh, God.  It doesn't go there.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I'd like to believe that we go somewhere after this life, but, man, if they're looking  at us, ugh.  Oh, God, I hope not.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Well, give my condolences to my sphincter.  I was just raising her. 
[02:58:00]  Come on, DeeDee.  Hop in.  All right, well.  Here's the deal.  You're going to have anal.  You don't want the guy using your drapes after he's done.  Oh.  So, what do you do?  Well, like, so, because I get tense a little bit because it does hurt.  Of course.  Oh, tell us more.  Timmy knows, like, say.  You have to.  He says it with such a puffy little face, but, like, you've got that cute little puppy 
[02:58:30]  dog boy thing, and then you talk about hookers.  Oh, well.  I'm not talking about hookers.  No, but you just have this innocence.  Never mind.  I'm a good boy.  So, to get me, like, to be less tense, he'll do a little bit of something first.  Mouth and hand, maybe?  Finger.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Wow.  That kind of loosened me up a little bit, and then I feel okay to...  Well, the hand's perfect.  You start with the pinky and slowly work your way up to the thumb.  Yeah.  I'm not used to, like, curfew. 
[02:59:00]  Curfew.  Then you get the other fist in there, then you clap, and then you're ready.  Oh, lard.  So, we start like that, so I'll get, like, less tense.  You know you're ready when he starts going, in the name of the people in the Senate...  Wait, what is it?  In the name of the Senate, the people of Rome.  Oh, well, God.  Aproculous.  So, that's how I get set up for that.  All right.  Very nice.  Yeah, loosen up the area a little bit.  Oh, God.  A lot of people want to know how many holes you've taken at one time.  What?  Well, it's either one, two, or three. 
[02:59:30]  Let's go.  At one time?  I'm usually with one guy, so...  Usually.  Usually.  Wow.  There was one time I was with two guys, and that was when I was in my 20s.  How was that?  Back in L.A., when I was, of course, still drinking.  Oh, that's...  All right, we're all going to sit back for this story.  Yeah, I'm throwing up a little bit.  Yeah.  All right, so we're with two guys.  Yeah.  Well, tell us more.  Well, I mean, it was my roommate, and somebody he knew, and it just kind of happened.  It wasn't meant to happen.  It just happened. 
[03:00:00]  Were you on the rotisserie?  No.  What were you doing?  Anthony came up with the best.  I forgot what it was, though, when a girl works two at one time.  Oh.  Wait, what did you...  Oh, the double pump?  Yeah.  But you had some kind of...  I forgot your analogy.  One of them was working the tank controls.  Right.  Where she's grabbing on one with each hand.  Tank controls.  Yeah.  Working some big rig equipment. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Working in the tank.  Some kind of front loader.  So, yeah, I had two holes there, then.  Oh, wow.  What, mouth?  Yeah.  And then, wow, finger cuffs.  So, you were on the rotisserie.  So.  Play cards on your back?  No.  Finger cuffs.  That'd be good.  Yeah, finger cuffs.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Any more questions?  Yeah.  I mean...  Oh, my God.  This guy has a great name for crime scene sex.  I've never heard it called this before. 
[03:01:00]  Let's see.  Let's go to Chainsaw the Trucker.  Oh, God.  Chainsaw.  I'm no trucker.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  I was going to tell you, we call that eating a girl on the rag.  We call that Ronald McDonald's mouth.  Bravo.  Oh, brother.  That is what it's called now.  And how long is it going to take for someone to grab that name for Ronald McDonald's mouth?  There goes another screen name. 
[03:01:30]  There goes another screen name.  That's hilarious.  That is very funny.  Definitely going to call it that name.  Wait, what's this, Steve?  Lex and Terry what?  What, Steve?  I guess there's audio of Lex and Terry trashing you from today.  Woo!  That Eric just put in there.  All righty.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Always good when the Opie and Anthony name is mentioned.  All right.  We'll find that in a minute or two.  Hope they don't give it to us too hard.  I don't know if we can handle it. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  You want another question for Sue Johansson here?  Yeah.  Let me hear.  Yeah.  Okay.  She discusses the dangers of labiaplasty.  What?  And labiaplasty is explained.  It's probably a surgery for shrinkage.  Yeah.  Yeah, my wife was curious about labiaplasty.  Is it safe and do you lose any sensation?  Yes.  Why does she want to do this?  Is it safe? 
[03:02:30]  Do you lose any sensation?  Yes.  What the hell kind of answer is that, you old bag?  So safe you wouldn't believe it.  Is it safe?  No, no.  Very dangerous.  Very careful.  Very dangerous.  So safe you wouldn't believe it.  Enjoy your youth.  It's the last time no one will expect you to have a tight labia.  Yeah, my wife was curious about labiaplasty.  Is it safe and do you lose any sensation? 
[03:03:00]  Yes.  Why does she want to do this?  She doesn't like them, says they bother her.  Now, she doesn't like them and they bother her.  Like, why do they bother her?  Um, I'm thinking just rubbing together, I guess.  And even if she has the size of her labia reduced, they won't rub together?  I guess. 
[03:03:30]  I don't have them, so I don't know.  I know.  I mean, I'd love to talk to her.  Yeah, I couldn't get her on the phone.  Oh, really?  Okay.  If you use what you cut off and the beef and broccoli.  I'll talk through you to her.  My concern is, you know, anytime you make an incision, you make a cut, you kill nerve endings.  Yeah.  Now, the labia have quite a few nerve endings.  And they're very sexually, they're easy to stimulate. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  So, if you have this kind of surgery, then you've lost that whole rim, ridge of nerve endings.  Okay.  That's what I was concerned about.  Yeah.  And they're not bothering you.  No.  And nobody else can see them.  No.  So, I mean, I can understand having your nose bobbed or something like that, but labia, nobody can see them.  Her nose.  So.  Nobody. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Hmm.  It's not risky surgery, but.  This woman's talking out her ass.  It will reduce sensations.  Okay.  So, that's the best I can say to you.  She's been stumped, Anthony.  Yep.  All right.  Maybe you can convince her.  Thanks a lot.  Okay, Joe.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  This is.  Go ahead.  I guarantee her dumb husband thinks that her lips are too big and wants him to get it reduced.  He's probably like, why don't you have that surgery? 
[03:05:00]  And she's like, I don't know.  And then he's trying to find out this dummy she's married to is probably doesn't like her fibula.  Well, perhaps they're ridiculous, Big.  I know you like them, Big.  No such thing.  You know, if it looks like Bubba from Forrest Gump.  I like that.  Maybe she's in there.  Perhaps she needs a little clipping.  No, she doesn't.  Tuck one into each sock and head on over.  I like that.  This is an awkward time to.  You guys talking about labia?  Yeah.  This is an awkward time to introduce our next guest.  A good friend of the show.  Vaginas.  Yeah.  Jim Gaffigan, everyone. 
[03:05:30]  Jim Gaffigan.  That's dirty.  It's really dirty, right?  It's so filthy.  I haven't seen you guys in a long time.  It's been a long time.  And now it's satellite radio.  So we can talk about this stuff freely and unfettered.  You can cuss, but that's sinning.  A regulation.  That's like sinning, really.  I remember when you guys were off the air, there was like, I would get these emails.  Am I not supposed to bring them?  No, no, no.  I would get these emails.  They're like, I control an Opie and Anthony website and I need a CD to do a fundraiser  so that they can get, you know, like an answer. 
[03:06:00]  Really?  People trying to review?  Like when you guys were off the air, it's like, we're doing kind of like this.  People are just getting free CDs from you.  No, but there's tons.  You know, the O&A fans are pretty amazing.  Yeah, I know.  They're rabid.  We call them our pests.  Yeah, they're our pests.  They're pests.  And they were getting free merchandise off of you.  Well, they were doing some auction.  I don't know.  I'm sure it was for a charity or something.  I'm sure it was.  Nothing special.  Yeah.  Well, Jim, you walked into an interesting situation here.  We're listening to some sex advice from this grandma, Sue Johansson. 
[03:06:30]  She does a show on the Oxygen channel.  I watch it every day.  Do you?  You do.  When I'm not watching Lifetime.  Oxygen.  I watch that.  Could you believe they actually made a worse channel than Lifetime?  They made it like Lifetime times ten for just whiny women.  Well, Lifetime also, they tried to do that HBO thing where they're like,  we're going to have Lifetime movies.  We're going to have the Lifetime reality channel.  Yeah, a Lifetime exclusive series. 
[03:07:00]  It's like, oh, who's this guy that beats the wife until she kills him?  Like, the same plot on every show and movie on that time.  Meredith Baxter Burney needs to work.  Starring Meredith Baxter Burney and Marky Post.  Okay, this one again.  A very special one, directed by the, I can't remember anything.  I smoke a lot of crack.  Everything's filmed through cheesecloth on that channel. 
[03:07:30]  It's got to be all fuzzy so they look good.  Sybil Shepard.  We need Sybil Shepard back.  We need her crazy ass back on the air.  Sybil Shepard and the mother from Family Time.  Lifetime.  Meredith Baxter Burney.  So this is a show on oxygen and the woman gets advice.  Old lady, grandma, yeah.  She's ancient.  She's a grandmother.  Yeah.  She's a grandmother.  Yeah, and not even like one of those hot grandmas.  Where you'd find those, I don't know either,  but I assume people would find grandma hot. 
[03:08:00]  But this one, no.  We're obsessed with, in this country,  we're obsessed with getting sexual advice from people  that we shouldn't be getting it from.  It's like, she's really old.  Like, in 1980, she wasn't getting laid.  Maybe we should ask her now.  Yeah, so why listen to her?  What does she, does she say just as, you know, explicit things?  Is that the allure?  Oh, yeah.  That's the whole gimmick.  She's kind of doing the Dr. Ruth, I guess.  Dr. Ruth never went this explicit.  Yeah, so, and then we got Deedee. 
[03:08:30]  She's a freak.  Hi, Deedee.  How are you?  I am not a freak.  She's a freak.  She likes to be spanked.  Would you like to spank Deedee?  Everyone else has.  You know what?  My hand, I just was spanking a lot of people earlier,  so I'm kind of like weaning off.  You got an injury.  You're on the injured reserve right now?  Yeah, I'm kind of doing it.  I'm doing the non-spank.  Well, we got whips and everything.  Really?  Yeah, she can't get enough.  Have you been doing some of that, Jim?  You've been doing the spanking?  I whipped her.  I spanked her yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She always comes in. 
[03:09:00]  Well, we're not here.  She does traffic.  Yeah, she's the traffic person in Texas.  Chicago.  Chicago, too?  Minneapolis.  So, are you the XM channel for traffic on those,  you know, like different cities have the traffic thing?  Yes.  Because people like hearing the voice of a five-year-old  telling you if there's traffic in your area.  We actually ruined her whole radio career.  She had a really good gig here at XM.  She did something for the kids channel.  She was on XM Kids.  I was cricket.  She was cricket on XM Kids, and we blew that one out.  What would you say as cricket, like on XM Kids, 
[03:09:30]  what would be like a line you would say?  Just, hey, the Wiggles are coming up.  Yay, let's all dance.  Woo-hoo.  And the kids would just freak out.  They love that voice.  Oh, yeah, they love Wiggles.  And now it's like, five-car pile up.  And now she was just explaining how she gets ready for anals.  Yeah, that's another thing.  You can see where there might have been a problem  with the XM management.  Conflict of interest.  Where's that lady from the kids channel?  She's got her face in the pillow with her dumper wide open.  Oh, God.  Lovely.  Now you know all the players. 
[03:10:00]  Enjoy that coffee this morning.  Hey, Jim, could you just take the whip and whip her once  for Jim Gaffigan?  Yeah, just so everyone knows what's going on here.  We want Jim Gaffigan to feel at home here.  I have to get the distance right.  This isn't going to be like that Denzel Washington Academy Award winning role.  In glory.  Yeah.  Where he just wouldn't cry.  She's just not going to cry.  Go ahead.  Do it.  I know, but you respect me.  But you have to do it.  Oh, the racial issues of this country. 
[03:10:30]  How they were in.  Lies.  You got the legs.  Now, this arouses you?  Not right now.  Not right now.  No.  Because she's fully clothed.  Oh, wow.  I love how Norton knows what he's doing with a whip.  He's like, wow, this is how I do it.  Oh, my God.  That was my back, too.  You know better.  Like hitting you on the back is any less humiliating.  Not in the back.  Just the ass.  I'm all for being whipped. 
[03:11:00]  Hold on.  I got to get the distance right.  The distance.  Oh, God.  The stink.  The stink.  It does.  Okay.  Just one more.  Look at Norton's eyes.  He really just scares me.  The Nazi comes out of him.  One more.  One more.  This guy's too scary.  They freaks me out.  He has to do it.  Jimmy was trying to tell us he's bleeding.  One more.  Jimmy was trying to tell us that he's never done this before.  That'll teach you.  That's going to teach you to run, boy.  Get an axe.  Half that foot's coming off. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, we're not.  It's amazing the impact of roots on our lives.  It's like.  That one?  Okay.  All right.  There you go.  I mean, it's like roots.  It's like you could make a reference to any, you know, like a farm in, like, Tennessee,  and you're like, roots.  I remember that.  That was the last episode where they bought that.  Yeah.  And they're chopping off the foot.  It's like if someone loses a toe, you're like, like on roots where you can't be lost  half a foot.  But he still can do things.  He can still walk.  Like 1976, and we're still referencing it. 
[03:12:00]  Someone has your water.  You have to look through it.  Make sure there's no saliva floating.  Arthur Haley.  He was like the to-do.  Alex Haley.  Alex Haley.  That was it.  Hey, let's throw an exo-biography.  Yeah.  Let's go to Virginia real fast.  Alan?  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh, I just got a term for you for crime scene sex.  I don't know if you guys have ever heard it.  You ever heard of making a Jap flag because of the way the sheets look when you're finished?  Making a Japanese flag.  Making a Japanese flag.  That's good, too, man. 
[03:12:30]  What part of Virginia are you from?  Haymarket.  How far is that from Falls Church?  It's not far.  Here it comes, kids.  The last time you were here, and I'm going to be there this time.  Who's going to be with you?  I do.  I'm not even plugging that.  The fact that I'm there June 25th is of no importance.  I don't want anybody to even think about it.  Yeah, but it's June 25th, right?  It's funny you should say that, Jim.  It is.  And Ticketmaster or 703-237-0300.  What's that number again?  I'm writing.  I want to write it down.  703.  These guys know the game. 
[03:13:00]  237.  237.  0300.  0300.  That's great.  We're Ticketmaster.  Whatever's convenient.  I'm probably going to go.  I go, and I love doing stand-up.  It's so fun to go and watch a stand-up.  You might as well get a nail-driven in your head.  You're like, ah.  Oh, you must go to comedy shows all the time.  Every girl I meet.  No, stupid.  I never go to them.  All right, so Jim Norton's going to be there.  And before we take a break, Jim Gaffigan in the studio.  And you're promoting a gig, too.  I'm at the improv tonight.  Tonight. 
[03:13:30]  I'm just a journeyman.  I'm not into the theater thing.  What are you there?  Tonight, tomorrow.  Tonight to what?  Tonight, tomorrow.  They added a show late Sunday.  Oh, look at you.  Nice.  So there you go.  So people can come and yell O&A.  And what movie's you in?  I got nothing.  I see you popping up all over the place.  I got nothing.  Commercials?  I'm in some Sierra Miss commercials because I think it's important to horror yourself.  Yes, that's what I've seen.  And I love, you know, I didn't do the commercials for the money.  I did it because I respect the product.  And I went out and I, I mean, I drink a lot of lemon lime soda. 
[03:14:00]  I really do.  And Sierra Miss is a lot better.  See?  It's a lot better.  And I was like, you know what?  I'll do this for free.  I'm doing the commercials for free.  Yeah.  Because I respect it.  You know what I mean?  And you, of course, one of the funniest roles in Super Troopers.  The Meow Guy.  That is a great part of that movie.  Well, thank you.  No, I'm very...  The Meow Game.  Yeah, it's a...  What an underrated movie.  Like, that is one of those cult movies that...  Oh, it's a huge cult movie.  Like, you watch it the first time and you find it really funny, but then you can watch  it five more times and it's funnier.  Yeah, it's like Raising Arizona. 
[03:14:30]  You're just like...  Yeah.  After, like, the fifth time, you're like, ah!  And it's the pothead movie.  Like, whenever people say, I've seen that movie five times, you're like, so you smoke  pot.  Smoke pot.  You're like, how could you tell?  I'm like, I don't know.  You got enough time to watch that movie five times?  That's very funny, though, that movie.  It's all glamour.  Yeah.  It's all glamour.  All right, we're going to take a quick break and we'll continue with Jim Gaskin.  Yeah.  Oh, again?  Yeah, I go every break.  Again, we've been talking for like an hour and a half straight here, I think.  Gamefly.com, though.  Oh!  First, we've got to talk about this for a few seconds here. 
[03:15:00]  It's basically a way of running games online, right?  I don't have my copy, Opie.  Why don't you...  Well, you're more the gamer.  Sounds like a great idea.

Yeah, we shouldn't put grease on the...  Well, which of the tried to grease it?  Well, the grease is white, and they said they don't want it because it then makes big white  globs by the joints of the mic stand.  He's farting again.

The virus made my genitals rot off.  Whoa, dude, don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection. 
[03:18:30]  And it was better than my first kiss.  Ah, laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  All right.  Jim Gaffigan in studio playing the improv here in Washington, D.C. 
[03:19:00]  pretty much all weekend long.  He's very funny.  Yes.  That's pretty funny.  Jim Norton's favorite comic.  I'll say.  Jim was cracking us up during the commercials.  He's talking about kind of like bad radio all over America.  Well, it's a struggle.  You go in some markets, and you're just like, you know, it's just awkward.  They just literally point at you.  All right.  Go.  Be funny.  One minute.  One minute to be funny.  The best is like the morning TV shows in the tiny markets.  It's because, I mean, you know, somebody's a DJ, and they have to communicate with people. 
[03:19:30]  But you'd think that, like, the morning TV people would be better at it.  But it's even more awkward in, like, some good morning kind of, you know.  We did one in Cleveland.  Oh, it's crazy.  And we've got to get the audio of that, because remember, we were making some off-colored  jokes and stuff, and they were just, like, horrified.  Oh, they are the most, like.  We're not cursing or anything, but, you know, we were talking about our gig, and they're  like, so, you guys excited to be in Cleveland and go to this gig tonight?  And I go, actually, not really.  It's going to be a sausage factory.  And they were just, they couldn't go to commercial. 
[03:20:00]  Uh-oh.  Yeah, they started looking at each other like, oh, boy, there could be trouble.  I did a TV thing here in D.C. where it was on location around Christmas, and there was  a new reporter, and it was some fundraising, Toys for Tots or something like that.  And it was literally, the interview went, like, so you're a comedian, so what are you  funny?  And I tried to do something, and it wasn't that funny, but she literally, she was like,  that's not funny.  Like, I was talking to a college student, you know, like, just on, you know, like, in a 
[03:20:30]  grocery store.  Oh, no.  We were on TV, and I was like, and I just looked at the camera, and I go, yikes.  And after that, people would come to the show, and they'd be like, that yikes was just so  brilliant, because there's so many awkward moments where, like, people are like, you're  a comedian?  You know, like, you're just going to make, can you make a pancake?  You know what I mean?  I'm just like, do it right now.  How did you not just attack her?  Not physically, but verbally.  Oh, it was, well, that's why I did the yikes thing, because it was just, but I went right 
[03:21:00]  up close to the camera and did the yikes.  Yeah.  But it's, some of it is, you don't have time.  And I knew I was heading there.  You know, it's like, she's like, yeah, Canadian?  I've never heard of you.  Are you Polly Swords, Brad?  Oh, no.  Where was she from?  She was, she was, it was a local thing in D.C. for a TV show, a morning show, Toys for Tots  thing.  All the sets look exactly the same, except for the number of whatever channel it is.  They got the, like, NBC or CBS logo, and it's all the same.  You walk in, it's just a different head of hair on the girl, but the same type of people. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, I mean, the one show, I mean, there is this WGN morning show in Chicago that's  pretty fun.  Really?  Yeah, it's like the rest of them, it's just, you're like, I don't know where they got these  robots from.  It's scary.  You're like, this is just going to be really awkward for about two and a half minutes.  You ever do Houston?  I had to do a morning show there where there's two guys in the studio, but one does all these  voices.  The gay guy, the black guy, and the hillbilly.  But you have to not act like this one fucking jerk off doing eight voices? 
[03:22:00]  Am I supposed to nod and respond to the black voice, you fraud?  I have to feed into your fucking complete lack of honesty with your listeners?  Yeah, funny black guy, the gay guy's looking at me.  Stay with me, white people.  So I didn't blow it for them, but I wouldn't acknowledge that it was different voices.  It was awful, and I was in there, and they started playing a Henry Phillips CD.  But not, they were being pleasant, but I was just bombing, and I knew it, and I hated  them.  Yeah, it can be really awkward. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  But I think there's a power of radio that, like, in Texas, in Addison, I did this station  and I left, and the guy kind of, like, built up some drama.  Like, we have some kind of, like, fight or something, and I'm sitting there going, I don't  even know who you are.  And, like, people would be like, after the show, they'd be like, so what are you going  to do about Pudge or whatever?  And I'm like, what about Pudge?  Well, he's got, like, a vendetta, I guess.  He was telling people not to come to the show, and I'm like, he's just advertising that I'm 
[03:23:00]  in town.  Was it Pugs and Kelly?  It was.  Wow.  Okay.  Good friends of ours.  What happened?  What happened?  Yeah, that's rare for them.  You know, it's like, I literally did, now I'm just playing into the fucking drama, aren't  I?  Yeah, what happened, Jimmy?  Look, African, I'm coming for you, man!  No, I literally was down there three years ago, and I was, it was like, you know, like,  you start with radio in the morning, and then it was like a midday one, and it was like,  you know, I was not working from a bonus or anything like that, so I was like, all right, 
[03:23:30]  yeah.  And I totally understand the value that it's a retail market and stuff, a retail business.  So I'm sitting there, and we're waiting about 30 minutes, and, you know, it's just like,  it's just this informal atmosphere, and I go, when are we going in?  Why wouldn't we be going in?  And the guy that I was with was like, well, he, sometimes you have to wait, and I go, all  right.  So then it was like 45 minutes, and I go, I go, look, this is kind of ridiculous.  It's like, if they don't want me on, I totally understand. 
[03:24:00]  Let's just get out of here.  And he was like, no, no, no, no, let's wait.  And so then it was like 50 minutes, and I was like, look, come on, you know, it's  like, they're discussing, you know, they're discussing the same garbage that we're discussing.  I go, let's just get out of here, tell them I'm sick, you know, let's just go, you know  what I mean?  And it's like, and it's like, finally, I was trying to convince the guy from the improv,  let's just go, it just doesn't matter.  And so then I go, and they're like, the African left out of here, and I hopped down, and he 
[03:24:30]  does all his stupid white guy jokes.  And then I found out that, you know, that some of it's an M.O., kind of like, it's kind  of like a Chicago radio thing where they came from, where it's a power thing, you make people  wait.  And I don't know, maybe you guys do that too, where you make shit.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  These two, Jimmy and Opie got into a huge, real, not even near fake, argument on the air,  cursing.  I didn't curse. 
[03:25:00]  No, you didn't.  Opie did.  Opie was quite a potty mouth.  Jim, I didn't curse.  I called him a fuck face.  It was a real, legitimate argument over the fact that Opie would make people wait outside  when nothing was going on in the studio.  Some of it is like, but again, it's like, look, I think it's like, you know, it's like  you're totally at the pleasure of the host of the show.  And I totally appreciate it.  But I got to defend myself, it's not because of a power show, it never is, it's about like  knowing what you have at the moment in the studio, you don't want to mess up the chemistry, 
[03:25:30]  so it's a weird thing you got to deal with every day.  Like with you, for example, we said, I found out you were here, I'm like, just bring them  right in and throw them right into the middle of what we were doing.  You've been on the show before, we know you can just come in and we'll talk about whatever.  We've had guys come in, you know, that are just showstoppers.  We call it the big, sweaty, dirty hand on the rusted brake handle.  Sparks are flying out of the wheel.  I totally appreciate that.  Better known as the cooler, you know, and then all of a sudden it takes you out of your game 
[03:26:00]  and it's like, so you deal with this on a daily basis, like, wow, I know that guy's  waiting a while, but I swear, it's never anything about power, it's about trying to make good  radio.  And to be fair, it's like, I don't, you know, I don't know, maybe it was one of those things,  but, you know, it's like, they didn't have to have me on, you know what I mean?  And it was like, and I heard that later on that they, you know, it was kind of like a  track record of, you know, and not, you know, like, I'm nobody, you know what I mean?  It's like, I can understand, you know, it's like, all right, let's, Potsy's here, let's 
[03:26:30]  put on Potsy before gas.  There was no one there, it wasn't like the Pope had died and they had all these bits they  wanted to do.  Breaking news.  It was just regular talk show father.  And then I heard afterwards, you know, and it's like, I was like, all right, well, you  know, the guy was pissed at me, so what?  And so then I'm going back down there and they're like, would you like to straighten  it out on the air?  I'm like, well, some of it is like, would you like to be, would you like to come in and  be attacked on the air?  And I've just, and I've had people come back from, from Addison, they're like, yeah, what 
[03:27:00]  happened with you and that guy?  I'm like, nothing happened.  It's like, literally, it's like, some of it is the drama for the drama's sake, so I'm  like, I, you know, it's like, I just, I do jokes on Hot Pockets, it's like, I'm not  like, sitting there, you know what I mean?  It's like, I don't know, I think it's funny.  That's very funny.  Speaking of DJs, Lex and Terry took some kind of weird shot at us at the end of their show  today.  Oh, no.  I hope they don't wreck my state theater gig on June 25th.  Let's take a listen.  June 23rd.  Oh, no.  Or a shot at me, I guess.  My favorite part about the wine country was the food. 
[03:27:30]  I got to stop going to Bartles and James, then.  I got, I went, you know, I went to that Opus One.  They didn't have a food.  It's like, the food was unbelievable.  I don't know.  They gave us a bunch of wine.  I don't know what it was.  We drank it.  I don't know if they, you know, there was a big group of us.  I don't know if they brought it in or what.  Join us tomorrow for a yuppie talk.  Doesn't get much gayer than this.  Yeah.  No.  Then we're going to rollerblade in Manhattan.  And pick up girls.  Yeah.  Because that's what they want to end up with. 
[03:28:00]  Speed skaters.  40-year-old speed skaters with thinning hair.  With red thinning hair.  That look like Ron Howard.  Take me, Opie.  What is that?  Like, I didn't get what that was, though.  Now, you guys, the one good slam, though, is they're saying that you want to pick up girls.  I know.  That's really awful to want that.  Exactly.  What do you think, pussy is yucky?  You fucking Florida zeros.  Were you seeing rollerblading once?  Is that what it was?  No, I commute to work. 
[03:28:30]  I inline skate to work.  How do they know that?  I don't even know what market they were until Steve looked it up.  He said they're out of Jacksonville.  How do you know where we commute from?  I inline skate to work through Central Park.  And I skate around Manhattan because it's an easy way to get around.  And God forbid I pick up girls.  I'm sorry.  I want to know, though, because that was kind of taken out of contact.  You and your gay picking up girls thing.  I think I've lost maybe 20 hairs in the last 10 years.  A lot of hair.  It's blonde and young looking.  Is my hair thinning?  I didn't even know.  Maybe someone needs to tell me this. 
[03:29:00]  That's one of my favorite things about you is your blonde, soft, touchable hair.  It's not red.  I don't think I'd fuck him if his hair was red.  I hate redheads.  I'd love to have that much hair.  Are you kidding?  I'm sorry.  I picked up checks.  Yeah, you're wrong.  I guess.  And then they said you look like Ron Howard because that's an Opie thing.  Trust me.  That's a good one.  I'm not happy that I'm stuck with his name, you know, but I made a name for myself in radio  and I'm stuck with it now.  I got the name when I was 12.  But, dude, anyone that would tie that in as an insult, like, you look like Ron Howard.  Like, ugh.  I don't look like Ron Howard, though.  Exactly.  It's kind of taken out of context, though. 
[03:29:30]  Were they talking about, were they goofing on you or was that something from something earlier  where they were maybe doing a speed skating story?  I have no idea.  No.  I know there's too many.  There's too many references for it to not be you.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever it is, I'm sure the laughs were big.  Yes.  Because those guys are hilarious.  Lex and Terry, I apologize that I like girls.  Yeah.  I'm not girls.  But what's wrong with you, though?  Seriously.  Like, you like to exercise and pick up girls.  What a fag you are.  Damn.  You should just be in a small market. 
[03:30:00]  Ah, the drama.  And broadcast to a few other small markets.  More drama.  More drama.  The drama's a drama, Jim.  These are the type of local jerk-offs that will have any comic in, though.  Like, comics, a lot of comics here get passed on.  They don't want them in.  But you go down there and they have, like, a deal where they'll pay 50 bucks or 100 bucks  or whatever it is to these local guys.  Hey, could you have so-and-so in?  Yeah, sure.  Really?  Yes.  That's how these local TV shows have all the comedians on.  They don't know you're funny.  They don't know you're not funny.  But they're getting, like, 50 bucks a piece or whatever the price is that they're getting.  That's how they get them in. 
[03:30:30]  That's what these little small market shitheads do.  Because they don't make any money.  But it is just like professional wrestling.  It's always just, like you said, the drama.  The drama.  The drama for the sake of drama.  It's like everybody needs...  You know, it's like you hear about these situations and you're like, you want to ship  them some Wellbutrin.  It's like, hey, man, I get cranky, too.  You take one of these pills, it'll do a wonder.  We get attacked a lot like that.  You know, people like jabbing at us.  But we usually settle it with our dopey-ass listeners. 
[03:31:00]  Our listeners are the worst pests, like the most annoying bastards.  Yeah.  And they'll search out, like, phone numbers and addresses and they'll harass these people  to no end.  Make maps and stuff.  What else will they do?  They'll search out this guy's phone number.  Yeah.  This guy's phone number.  We had a...  Oh, all you have to do is say something like, the chair is against the wall.  The chair is against the wall.  Manchurian Camden.  We had a slight thing with this guy, Todd Schnitt. 
[03:31:30]  He's out of, uh, somewhere in Florida.  A radio station.  Tampa, maybe.  It's always Florida guys, by the way, that come after you.  Have you noticed it's always Florida guys?  It's so cranky.  It's so sunny and nice down there.  So he calls us imbeciles or something, whatever.  So we responded and then our listeners took it to a whole new level, right?  Oh, really?  The guy thought he could trash talk us a little bit.  Like, ah, whatever.  We'll take on anyone, pretty much.  Well, yeah, we have taken on everyone.  It's fun.  And the listeners took it to this level where the guy calls our agent, because he so happens 
[03:32:00]  to be represented by the same guy, and is telling our agent, don't these guys know  I'm represented by you as well?  Like, he couldn't take it.  So now behind the scenes, he's calling our agent to tell us to stop.  It's like if someone called your dad to make you stop doing something.  What?  Like, I know I kicked your son in the ball.  Can you tell him to stop beating me up?  No, it's got to be flattering on a certain level that, like, you're like the...  We're the target.  The targets.  You're where they have to take the pot shots to get some credibility, right? 
[03:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  But they...  Yeah.  Always these Florida guys, because they think that they're like...  There's something about being down there with all the hot chicks, and they just can't  break through.  But it was Schnit, he's out of Florida.  These two jack-offs are out of Florida.  And who's the other one?  Shannon was out of Florida.  I don't remember him, yeah.  They're all out of...  I don't even remember what...  Of course, I don't remember what town he was out of.  And he wasn't a town, I didn't know a city.  Always something.  They're all out of Florida.  And, you know, it's interesting also with radio, because it's like, you're like, if  you're that...  If you don't like it, what are you doing listening to it? 
[03:33:00]  It's like, if you don't like Bill O'Reilly, don't watch it.  You know what I mean?  Unless you just need to be angry about it.  I love the people, yeah, that have to be angry.  They watch and go, oh, I hate this guy.  I can't believe it.  I went and I bought satellite radio.  I got XM just so I could listen to Opie and Anthony and be angry.  I hate them.  And I'm paying to hate them.  I didn't know.  Honest to God, they know he rollerblades.  I didn't know if Terry of Lex and Terry was male or female by the name.  That's as honest as I can be.  I have no idea. 
[03:33:30]  How do they know anything about this show?  Why would you know?  It's a lot of jealousy, right?  I mean, some of it's a tactic and some of it's jealousy.  Look at that news chick, though, Kim.  I wouldn't mind banging her.  She's not bad.  I'm sure she's a very talented, funny person on the news.  She's really revealing and exposing herself.  What's up, DeeDee?  Hey.  Hi.  You like Jim Gaffigan?  Yeah, he's cool.  He's going to be at the Improv.  Are you going to see him?  Sure.  Maybe spank him after the show?  You can also go to my website, jimgaffigan.com. 
[03:34:00]  Jim, I don't know if you have a website.  It's funny.  Eatabullet.com.  Eatabullet.com.  That's old Jimmy Norton's website.  Yeah.  Or jimgaffigan.com.  They don't have to go there.  People have trouble with the spelling of your last name.  It's G-A-F-F as in Frank, I-G-A-N.  And you can buy my CDs there.  Not that you need to.  But if you love Opie and Anthony, I would go and buy them.  You guys want to do one more Sue Joah Hanson clip?  Of course.  All right.  The grandma from the Oxygen Channel.  This is how this all started here. 
[03:34:30]  Let's listen to this one.  Out to Texas, we're going to talk to Lisa.  Hi, Lisa.  Hello.  Hi.  Question.  Yes.  And I was just wondering, what is too young for a child to start exploring their body?  And I have a three-year-old that...  Well, can I look for my guess?  No, I'm serious.  I say six days.  Six days?  DeeDee?  Why ask Kyle?  Well, okay, when you're changing a diaper, sometimes boys start playing with their wee-wee, 
[03:35:00]  so like a weird...  Anthony, don't you show them how.  Yeah, no.  Why is the question always how old they should be before they start exploring their body?  What about other people?  How old should they be before I finally break down?  Oh, God.  Do that thing for DeeDee again.  The tongue thing?  Oh.  Watch this.  It's like Wiggles funny.  Jim, can you do that?  I wish I could. 
[03:35:30]  You can't do that.  I wish I could, but I can't.  I can't do that.  Do it again.  Look at him move.  She really gets excited.  No, I'm not excited.  But you know what would be good.  You know what would be good.  You can please the women and also be a red flag for a serial killer.  Yeah.  He's going to do this thing with his tongue to the girl.  Watch.  Like a lizard.  Wait a minute.  He's not doing that to a girl.  He's doing that to a dead girl.  That's sad. 
[03:36:00]  She likes to, I guess you could call it masturbate.  Yeah.  She likes to play with herself.  Right.  But she also likes, when she was much younger than that, she sucked her toes, didn't she?  Yes.  And she spent hours looking at her hands.  Uh-huh.  And she sucked her thumb.  Right.  Yeah.  Do you know, you don't realize it, but she was also playing with her genitals every chance  she got.  Okay.  Little kids start to pleasure.  How does this woman know?  Yeah.  What if she... 
[03:36:30]  Your daughter, when I would watch her, she would do all these crazy things.  You know, they have the older lady so that they can get away with it.  It's like, it's not offensive if it's a grandma.  If it's some old white lady, it's okay.  Uh-huh.  You know what I mean?  But if it was an old man, like this, first of all, a guy can't do this.  A guy can't do this at all.  But you might maybe get away with it if it's a real doctor in a coat and everything, in  an office with diplomas all over the walls.  Maybe. 
[03:37:00]  But imagine an old man sitting there with a young girl calling up, yeah, she touches  herself, doesn't she?  It's like, I'm sure when they do this show, they can never do any tight shots.  They always have to show her whole body so that there's no mystery that it's very medical.  You know what I mean?  Her hands are completely away from her.  They're like, can you needlepoint while you answer some of these questions?  We need to reinforce the grandma thing.  Oh, that's funny.  Let's continue.  Little kids start to pleasure themselves, explore their bodies at a very early age. 
[03:37:30]  And you know what?  It's okay.  Oh.  Nothing bad is going to happen.  Okay.  And don't stop her.  Just let her go.  You wouldn't stop her from sucking her toes, would you?  No.  No.  So why would you stop her from touching her genitals?  Okay.  I just didn't know if it was normal for her.  Because her brother's name is Toes.  Could be a problem.  I think she should have said, you know, listen to me because what do I know?  I'm just some old lady on a TV show and you're having me influence how you're raising your children. 
[03:38:00]  What is wrong with people?  That's pretty much it.  What she's saying is, you know, I'm just an old broad here.  Instead of asking a relative who might have raised children, what if she has that perfect stranger  who has a show on Oxygen that eight people watch?  She's just trotting around your house, flips this on and goes, you know, I do have a question.  I would like an answer, too.  My kid's over here in the corner playing with herself.  Why don't you just call up and maybe ask if this is okay?  I'd love to have a show like that because the advice you give her is, all right, what you've got to do is 
[03:38:30]  you pinch her nose really hard and say, dirty, dirty, dirty.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Put pepper on her fingers so it burns.  Yeah, Tabasco sauce, real mental scars.  I hate to think the kid's waking up when she's 22.  I don't know why.  Sweating and crying.  Back to sleep.  Okay, I didn't know if it was normal for that young.  It's very, very normal.  Did you know that little girls, you know, one year of age, two years of age, can masturbate 
[03:39:00]  very nicely?  Nicely.  I suspected.  Boy, I like this lady.  She's good for guilt.  It's like she's also kind of like trying to just keep bringing it up.  She's like, they masturbate when they're two, when they're one.  You know what they do when they're one and a half?  They masturbate.  It's like, you can say it, Grandma.  You can say whatever you want. 
[03:39:30]  But if you were on like a normal TV station, you couldn't even say masturbate.  They'd be like, can you change it to Yahoo-y?  Children and masturbation in the same sentence on regular TV.  Oh, my God.  Never.  I got yelled at one time because there's my friend and a baby, and the kid was adorable.  He was like, you know, probably like a year old.  I'm like, wow, he's a cute kid.  I'm like, is he a jerk off yet?  The guy's like, what?  I'm like, is he a jerk off yet?  Yes.  You asked that?  Yeah.  He asked that at the brisks.  Is he going to have to take a couple of weeks off? 
[03:40:00]  Thank you for bailing me out of that bomb, Jim.  Jim's at a christening.  Beautiful kid.  Does it masturbate?  I want to carry that image home with me tonight.  Do you reject his masturbation?  I do reject his masturbation.  What do you do with some of his dirty diapers?  Do you store them anywhere?  Because I'd love to get my hair from the echoing in the church.  Masturbate.  Bait.  Bait.  I don't know if you've ever babysat a little baby girl and you put her in front of the 
[03:40:30]  TV and she's watching Barney, let's say, and she straddles the arm of the sofa and she's  rocking back and forth watching Barney and you look at this kid and you say, I don't believe  it.  She's getting off on Barney?  Normal.  She's everything normal.  Okay.  Don't worry about her.  She's fine.  She's one healthy little gal.  Okay, great.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Did she go?  Bye-bye.  Yes, she does that.  Is that her thing?  Yeah.  That's her thing. 
[03:41:00]  I think the best advice, if you see that happening, you don't want the kid to feel self-conscious,  just join them.  Oh, my God.  What?  I'm giving out some advice.  I can't wait until Norton has a kid.  It's going to be like, well, maybe they'll do that joke.  Yeah, perhaps I was a little out of my conscience.  Believe me, that's why I don't want kids.  I know half my act to go down to the toilet.  If I ever get married, I'll feel awful.  I'm like domestic violence humor.  Forget it.  Imagine Jimmy on stage after having kids.  Hey, I have a six-month-old now. 
[03:41:30]  A six-month-old.  Everyone starts applauding and you've got to talk about baby things.  Life-changing experience, folks.  Yeah.  You're like the Don Rickles of this generation, so you'll be able to separate it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't either.  You better not have kids.  Just to keep my act fresh, I'll have to go home and hit it.  Jesus.  Kick it down the stairs a few times.  What do we have?  Like, what?  A minute and a half left?  Yeah, that's the end of the show music.  Do we know the improv number for Jim Gaffigan tonight through Sunday?  202.  That's good. 
[03:42:00]  That's a good start.  Jesus.  You know where you're going to the area?  Good shot.  I got it here, I think.  202-296-7008.  Or 7008.  202-296-7008.  Is that a good room?  For Jim Gaffigan.  I've never done it.  But Gaffigan's there tonight through Sunday.  Very, very funny.  He's the theater king.  And Jim Norton, June 25th.  5th.  State here, Virginia.  Oh, what he does.  State here.  Yeah, spelled T-R-E means it's fancy. 
[03:42:30]  Anything else you want to get off your chest there, Jim?  Did we cover it all, you think?  I'm just honored.  I'm thrilled that I've gained some weight.  I just wanted to come in and show everyone.  That's nice.  Showing it off well.  That's about it.  Yeah, Jim's very funny.  Go see him.  This is it for us in D.C., I guess.  Yeah, we're back in New York when?  Tuesday?  Tuesday.  We're taking off.  I'm going to Atlantic City for a little while.  I'm heading over there.  Why not?  Why not?  A little three-card poker.  A little blackjack, maybe. 
[03:43:00]  You're going to Atlantic City, and I'm going to check out tampons.  Is that what you're doing?  So I'm prepared on Tuesday.  On your rollerblades?  On my rollerblades with my thinning hair.  Picking up girls.  Picking up girls.  Yeah, girls.  Are you really going to check on tampons?  Yeah, I'm working on this whole bit, because I don't get why you ladies have all these choices.  It should be one easy choice.  Yep.  I feel like one easy.  Like Russia?  Just a big CCCP on it?  What's with you with your licenses, too?  What do women need licenses for?  Yeah, right. 
[03:43:30]  I'm joking.  I was doing your jobs.  DeeDee, thank you so much.  You're welcome.  You get the final word.  What do you got?  Have a good weekend.  It's Friday day.  Oh, what do you want me to say?  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  It'll be abandoned.  You're welcome.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you.  I want to talk to you. </pre>
