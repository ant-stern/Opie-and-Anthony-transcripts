<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a phone call from Jay Moore, a friend of the show and comedian, who discussed his recent divorce from Nicky Cox, his struggles navigating the show's phone screeners (including using the "FU line"), and his upcoming comedy gigs.  The conversation was punctuated by sexually explicit language, humorous anecdotes about Moore's experiences on *Last Comic Standing*, and various other celebrity mentions including Vin Diesel, Chris Jericho, Rodney Dangerfield, and a prank call impersonating Moore on Howard Stern. Ben and Steve were eventually brought into the studio.  The segment concluded with arranging for Moore's future in-studio appearance and promoting his West Palm Beach Improv shows.

The hosts then shifted to internal matters, discussing personnel changes within their team, including Rick Delgado's unemployment and an altercation between staff member Eric and security at a Tony Danza show that involved the police, but no charges were filed.  A significant portion focused on a prank targeting a Tony Danza fan message board, which the Opie and Anthony "Army" flooded with obscene posts.  They also discussed their own interactions with Danza's audience, and the excessive applause breaks during his show.  The conversation then veered to a lengthy discussion about Jonathan Harris (Dr. Smith from *Lost in Space*), focusing on jokes about his alleged pedophilic tendencies towards Will Robinson and speculating on the young actor's possible involvement in pornography.  Frenchy, a French chef, briefly called in to promote the show.  A call from someone impersonating a caller's crazy ex-girlfriend also interrupted the segment.

Next, the show featured a humorous exchange involving "Dr. Smith" and crude sexual jokes.  Norton, a regular contributor, then shared stories about his tumultuous relationship with his ex-girlfriend, detailing incidents involving property damage, financial impropriety, and drug use, including a disastrous first date involving a failed cocaine purchase. Opie and Anthony then shared their own early sexual experiences, including graphic details about their first sexual encounters.  Anthony's brother, Joe, called in to add details about Anthonyâ€™s experiences,  further emphasizing the graphic sexual descriptions.  The brothers also recounted their upbringing in California, their early exposure to sex and alcohol, and their eventual return to New York, including an unsavory bus trip and arrest.  Intern Nathaniel contributed behind-the-scenes anecdotes.  Comedian Rich Voss was mentioned as a listener.


A caller, Joe, recounted a humorous police encounter involving confiscated knives. This led into raunchy jokes comparing women to cartoon characters and animals.  The hosts then discussed their move to XM Satellite Radio, defended their "shock jock" label, and addressed tension between Opie and Anthony during their two-year hiatus.  A lengthy segment followed, focusing on a nostalgic, comedic riff on 1970s Quinn Martin television detective shows, filled with crude humor and jokes about the actors. The Robert Blake trial was briefly mentioned.  The segment culminated in a chaotic and inappropriate in-studio segment with a guest named Bernie, involving a failed prank.

Ozzy Osbourne then appeared as a guest in studio.  The conversation began with a humorous debate about Black Sabbath and U2 song titles and quickly moved to a newspaper article alleging Ozzy had cosmetic surgery, which he denied. He discussed other absurd press reports, including suggestions that Black Sabbath fire him.  He addressed the possibility of a Black Sabbath reunion and new album, expressing reluctance unless the quality matched their past work, emphasizing it wouldn't be solely for financial reasons. He discussed various Black Sabbath iterations and past disputes over royalties.  The interview concluded with Ozzy playfully insulting the hosts, giving a final "fuck you," and promoting the show.  A final segment featured more discussion regarding Ozzy's recovery from an ATV accident, his sobriety, his family's struggles with addiction, his views on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and his work on a Broadway musical about Rasputin.

[00:02:30]  VIOLIN PLAYS  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  You know, it took six months, but finally, Jay Moore, a friend of the show, has been doing 
[00:04:00]  radio with us off and on for, I don't know, four years.  Yeah.  Finally called in to say hi on the new XM show.  And did not disappoint.  Not at all.  Very fun.  Very fun.  A lot of fun.  Very fun.  Which would be a lot of fun.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  So, very fun.  And you can maybe put dash, and I mean it.  Exclamation point.  And he revealed a lot of what was going on in his personal life, which made a lot of  the gossip columns in newspapers all across America.  This is how it went down.  Check it out.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  It sounded like Stephen Lynch and Pike.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Jay Moore.  Jay Moore! 
[00:05:00]  Oh, when you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong.  Jay, what's up?  Oh, when you're wrong.  Oh, hi.  What's up, Mitchum?  What the hell, Jay?  Have we just crossed the lines?  We haven't been able to get a hold of you?  Or what the hell is going on?  I've called you guys probably a half dozen times, and it's the first time your moron phone  sausage slapper didn't quiz me and then not let me through.  Because we figured you'd probably be one of the first guests we had on the show.  We've been on for a year and a half now. 
[00:05:30]  And your phone screen is like, hi, I know it's really you.  What do you do for a living?  Where do you live?  I said, come on, I'm up early on my way to a job.  What job are you working on?  And then I go, oh, fuck off, and I hang up.  And then I left like a dozen messages on the FU line.  You never played those.  Those were, Jay left messages on the FU line?  I did, because I'd read it on my satellite in my truck, and I'd be like, fuck you.  Whatever floated my boat that day, I'd curse someone else.  And then I cursed out Funchie like ten phone calls in a row. 
[00:06:00]  Rumor has it you have XM?  Me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You do?  Do you subscribe to the Opie and Anthony show?  No, you don't, do you?  You just got real quiet.  I can barely hear you now.  Yeah, I can barely hear you.  What the heck is going on?  Can you hear us?  I can hear you now.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah, Anthony wants to know if you actually got the XM.  I've had XM.  I had it before you guys were on it. 
[00:06:30]  And did you subscribe to our premium service?  I did, and now I get it for free, so someone owes me six bucks.  Six bucks.  What have you been doing, man?  Having a baby, just kind of hanging out with my son.  We heard about the baby thing.  I got a divorce, made a couple tabloids.  Yeah, we read that.  We read that, and we're wondering what the hell happened.  What do you mean?  Did it just, you know, kind of, the relationship kind of went to the wayside? 
[00:07:00]  Because you two seemed very close.  You know, when you drive into a tunnel, it says clearance 14 feet.  Yeah.  We were, like, 14 feet and a quarter inch at all times.  Really?  You kept deflating the tires to get through that tunnel, and eventually you just didn't  feel like putting in the extra work.  Where's Buttercock Scotchcock?  What?  Where's Big Tits?  Yeah, where's Eat a Bullet Boy?  I'm right here, bro. 
[00:07:30]  Hey, are you working anywhere this weekend?  Uh, yeah, I'm in Florida.  Where in Florida?  West Palm Beach Improv.  Why, what's going on?  Where are you going to be?  No, I was just curious.  If I wanted to come see you, how would I get a ticket, sir?  Oh, thank you.  Wow, come on, guys.  Yeah, well, we're used to the Jimmy plugs, but not like that.  Are you still figuring out what it's me?  What?  This is what I went through with your phone screeners to get through.  Today was all right, but it's like getting an escort.  He's like, what's your number? 
[00:08:00]  All right, let me call you back immediately.  Well, this whole thing's been a drama.  Ben talks to us almost every day.  Okay, well, Jay said he's calling tomorrow, and then you don't call, and then, well, Jay  was busy doing this.  Ben didn't get in touch with me until Anthony was sick in the tournament, so anything he  said prior to that is a lie.  Hmm.  All right, well, get Ben in here.  I got friends in mind going, how come you're not on the show?  I'm like, I don't know, the booker and producer never let me know how to get in touch with  them.  Dude, we need celebrities on the show. 
[00:08:30]  We wouldn't blow you off.  We need anyone we can get at this point.  Hi, guys.  And I don't mean that in a bad way.  I'm just saying, we would have, we would have.  You know.  And Steve is Steve.  Jay didn't leave messages on FU line.  That's what Steve's saying.  Get these guys in here.  That's a lie.  All I do is I drive around, I dial a stupid FU line.  I said FU to Frenchie.  I said FU to the screener not putting my call through.  I said FU to you guys for having Voss on before me.  Then I called back and said, really, FU for having Frenchie on before me? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, we expected you right from the start.  Yeah, we thought we'd start the show and the first call would be from Jay Moore.  Hey, did you really go to the Super Bowl with Nicky Cox?  Yeah.  Wow.  Is that your new squeeze?  Dude.  Yeah.  Wow.  How was it being in a tabloid?  Wow.  Whatever you read in the tabloids is true.  I love it.  He's not even denying anything.  That's true.  She's a hottie.  No, she's great, man. 
[00:09:30]  She's cool.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's very interesting.  Yeah, we got divorced.  We filed like four months ago.  Was it a nice, pleasant divorce or was there anger and throwing things in?  No, she was a peach.  And I'm going to take everything from you and, you know, like mine.  No, you know, they say it's half, but it's not.  It starts at half.  It's like doing a bookie.  It starts at half?  It starts at half, and then you get alimony and child support. 
[00:10:00]  So it's like being with a bookie.  You pay your debt, and they're like, well, what about the juice?  Oh, Jesus.  That's got to amount to a lot of cash.  It's like 70%.  And what about the house?  Do you still live?  Did you have to get an apartment, and she lives in a house?  No, I bought the house before we were married, and I rent a beach house down at Huntington  Beach.  So I'm actually, I made out like that.  But isn't that part of marital property, even though you owned it beforehand?  Or did you have a prenup or something?  Not in California.  Really? 
[00:10:30]  And you can have, I just want custody of my son, so you can have all the money in the  world.  I don't care.  There you go.  I'll go work Uncle Sputchy's Chuckle Hut.  And it only took four months to get the divorce?  No, it's not finalized yet.  It's not over.  Oh, okay.  Because you know Anthony's took, we were talking about this yesterday, three years?  About three years.  Three years.  It takes forever.  About three years with Dominic Barbara as my wife's lawyer, so that was nice and fun  to have to do that.  You know what happens?  It's like you're right about to finish up, and then some, one of their girlfriends get 
[00:11:00]  in their ears, and they're like, I need to wash your dryer.  It's like, well, come fucking take it.  What do you want from me?  Yeah, you know, people start yapping to them, and they give them ideas.  Yeah, you deserve that.  They got a divorce.  They got robbed.  Yeah, you deserve that, girl.  You put in your time.  You stuck by him.  You stuck by him when he was nothing.  Yeah, that old gag.  Well, she wrote all the jokes for you, right?  Yeah.  She did write.  She was like Rodney's wife.  She'd tell them into my ear when I was on stage and shock me with a prod when I fucked 
[00:11:30]  them up.  You know, Rodney's wife used to say, you ever see that when Rodney's wife had like the  IFB, and she'd speak into a mic and tell the jokes into his ear when he was on stage?  No.  She did that for him?  Yeah, like the last year of his life when he was at the laugh factory, and he just watched  him to see if he'd piss his pants on stage.  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Hey, Wayne, it's a father of a club.  Don't tell anybody you're Jewish, all right?  Okay.  And she was giving him his lines?  I didn't hear that one. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, he'd wear it.  It's true.  I saw it with my own eyes.  My own eyes.  Ah, that is.  He'd wear an IFB in his ear, and then she'd be upstairs with a book of his jokes and a  microphone, and she'd just like whisper them into a microphone, and he'd repeat them, and  it'd be like these awkward pauses in between jokes.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  And I would love to grab one of her tits during his act just to hear Rodney go, oh.  Would she tell him the whole joke, or just key it? 
[00:12:30]  I don't know.  I just saw her speaking into the mic.  It was very, uh...  Why were they allowing him to work at that point?  Wow.  Huh?  Why were they allowing him to work at that point?  Someone should have stepped in and said, look, man, you know...  It's Wally Sparks, dude.  She's pumping every penny out of him.  Are you going to tell Wally Sparks he can't take the stage?  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I guess you're right.  Dude.  There's a lot of changes in your life there, Jay.  Hey, Jay, Last Comic Standing, they did, uh...  I mean, obviously, I was with you there on Season 2 for a little while.  Season 3, they seem like they kind of just jumped right into it. 
[00:13:00]  Are they going to do anything with that, or did they kind of wreck it by doing that?  They wrecked it, and we didn't want to do it.  And they said when friends and, um, Frasier were gone, and they needed something for the fall,  and they asked us to do Last Comic Standing, but a different version of it with no house.  Yeah, the house is like the fun part.  I said, well, that's evening at the improv.  Yeah.  They said, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good, it's good.  And they're like, no, it's terrible, it's terrible.  Like, can you imagine, like, The Apprentice, like, a month later, you bring back all the losers from The Apprentice, 
[00:13:30]  like, with no boardroom.  It was just stupid.  They just work, and you film them working?  And so then, um, then they canceled it with a week to go.  I was like, you guys are fucking brilliant.  They wrecked the franchise.  They ruined it.  We all know it's because a black guy won, and NBC can't have a black person winning a reality show.  Oh, is that a...  Uh-oh.  Oh, dude, oh, buddy, I feel bug nice right now, son.  Are you playing in the area?  I'm hearing rumors. 
[00:14:00]  No, no tickets got sold to the promoter at the cancel.  Oh, come on, where?  It was at the State Theater in New Brunswick and the State Theater in Easton, Pennsylvania, on my tour of theaters only called State.  Oh, God damn.  You missed me, didn't you?  Yeah, we did.  You know something.  Everyone was bashing you.  I know.  I listened to it all, and I just sat through it and said, you know, the light, the sunshine's a good cleaner. 
[00:14:30]  The sun will come out, and everything will get cleaned up.  You know our listeners.  They don't forget anything.  They don't put anything down, and they're brutally loyal to this program.  A couple of guys.  Let's see.  Roast this fucker for taking so long.  Don't go easy on him.  Shut up, Jay.  Hang up the phone, you skank.  Hey, remember that one?  Hang up the phone, you skank.  Well, my fingers, it's shit.  Is Jay ever coming into the studio? 
[00:15:00]  Get Jay more off the phone.  Like, they're angry that you didn't stop in sooner.  Some of them are angry I stopped in at all.  I got to say, in defense of Jay, it's like, look, everyone wanted Jay to call in sooner,  but he did have a lot of shit going on.  I mean, when you're going through a divorce, it's not exactly easy, you know, and you're fighting for custody.  Your first priority is not to call into a radio show.  But I did call, and that's the thing.  I was guest hosting, like, the Roger Lodge fucking extravaganza or whatever, like, some sports talk show out in L.A., 
[00:15:30]  and I was, like, sitting on the toilet, like, 20 minutes before I was going to go on the air.  It's, like, the only time I'm ever awake when it's dark out, and I don't know if it was Eric or whoever,  they're like, how do I know it's really you?  I'm like, it's me.  Well, what are you working on?  I'm like, come on, dude.  They did not do that to you.  Like, the more questions he asked me, the more time I'm going to have to be with the guy.  That's what I heard.  I heard a lot of people, the phone screen, it was giving him a lot of grief.  They should just, you know, put him through it. 
[00:16:00]  Put him through it.  If it wasn't Jay anyway, it would make for good radio.  We would know it.  We would know it in a second.  Where's Steve saying I didn't call the FQ line?  Yeah, where's Steve?  Where's Ben?  Everyone's hiding.  Yeah, they went for the half because they're all fucking right.  Ben has no problem starting all sorts of rumors, but we're trying to get him in here,  and he's just, he's sitting at his computer.  First we have to go in here.  Jerky, true carry glasses, faggot.  Make him believe that he doesn't hear us right now.  Now, Steve has entered the studio with his blonde hair, blonde locks. 
[00:16:30]  Anthony, how did you do in the poker thing, Anthony?  In the poker thing?  I did all right.  You know, I sat at a table.  I couldn't have gotten one of the tables with, like, celebrities.  I sit at a table, and it's full of poker pros, superstars.  You, the executioner, and Amarillo Flynn.  It was the worst.  So I was sitting there.  I did all right.  I lasted a few hours.  It was a hell of a lot of fun.  Well, you said all you wanted to be was not the first one out.  Not the first one out, and I wanted to have a good hand. 
[00:17:00]  You called him a destroyer.  That's it.  I wanted to have a couple of good hands against the pros.  Ed Asner called it opiate destroyer.  Oh, wasn't that great?  Ed Asner was cursing me out.  What did he say?  Lose the wasp.  Get rid of the fucking wasp, he said.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Okay, Lou.  Well, we have Steve in the studio.  Yeah.  You know, we got calls from Billy, La Machine, telling us that Jay had called the FU line.  And Ben and I and Eric went through maybe a hundred of these messages going back four days at a time, 
[00:17:30]  and we couldn't find a single one that even remotely sounded like Jay.  Billy called me and said, they want to know what you said so they can find it faster.  Yeah.  How is that?  Is it like an email?  Yeah, it's exactly what it is.  We're looking through audio clips that are sent in via email.  That's how the voicemails work.  Well, perhaps, Jay, you didn't say fuck enough times in the FU line message for Steve to put it on.  Wouldn't the project matter be Jay Moore? 
[00:18:00]  What?  Yeah.  What did I say?  Yeah, the key word would have been Jay Moore.  No.  Then we didn't find a single one, and we all looked.  And now we got Ben in the studio.  Now Ben is ready to confront Jay Moore.  No, I'm not confronting.  Jay's just hard to get a hold of.  And he calls me back.  You call back like a week later.  I called and called.  Guys, you understand.  I've been calling this show probably twice a week for however long you've done the year.  Ugh.  Wow.  No.  No?  Steve says no.  It's not like Ben and I would actively cockblock this guy's appearance. 
[00:18:30]  We have no motive in that regard.  Why would we do that?  Why would you want Jay on this show, though?  I mean, I don't get it.  We've wanted Jay since the first day.  We wanted Jay to be one of the first guests.  Why are you not calling him back?  If you were a comic, Steve.  Jesus Christ.  Pimp hand.  Pimp hand.  Anthony, you know divorce is like the worst, right?  Ugh.  Stinks.  But did you have that, like, when you're going through it, that moment of clarity where  you realized everything was going to be fine?  No.  I'm still not through that.  As I write my checks every three months, as I sign that check, oofah. 
[00:19:00]  I did not want to get divorced.  Like, I had, like, this whole thing about a two-parent household and how important it  is to the child.  And then I was staying at this little house on the beach, and I was with this Argentinian  girl.  And I was banging her, and she goes, fuck me like I'm bad.  And I go, all right.  And I, like, smack her ass.  And she goes, she turns around.  It was fucking her doggy style.  And she turns around, and she goes, no, fuck me like I'm bad.  And she spits on my stomach. 
[00:19:30]  Wow.  And I go, okay, you little fucking bitch.  And I start fucking her, and I'm, like, kind of choking her, you know?  And her eyes are kind of bugging out of her head, and I had issues, you know, rage issues  with women at the time anyway.  Of course.  And then I had, like, my fingers in her mouth.  Like, I was going bleh, like I was making a face, like pulling her cheeks apart with  my fingers.  Yeah.  And I'm fucking her, and I'm pulling her hair.  And then I pulled out, and I came in her face, and I thought to myself, this just might  work. 
[00:20:00]  This might be my new pass.  You were giving her the fish hook.  Yeah, it was both hands.  It was rape, actually.  Oh, God.  That is funny.  How hot was she?  She was pretty hot.  Yeah, of course.  You're calling from L.A., Jay?  Huh?  You're calling from L.A.?  No, Argentina, dude.  Like a little pig from Argentina.  When are you going to be in New York? 
[00:20:30]  I'm not now.  I have to cancel these dates.  I don't know when I'm coming back.  You really had to cancel?  Yeah, I had, like, 30% of the tickets sold, and the promoter's like, I'm going to take  a bath.  What happened?  I don't know.  Comedy's not big in Easton, unless your name's Larry Holmes.  The Easton Assess.  Doesn't Larry Holmes look like when Billy Crystal does the old Jew makeup?  The lips. 
[00:21:00]  That's good.  Hey, how about on the Oscars when Robin Williams did a fucking Elmer Fudd impression?  Oh, it was awful, wasn't it?  Stop.  Like, I was always kind of non-partial, and I never got involved in the he's good, he's  bad argument.  Yeah.  And then I just went, you suck cock.  Big elephant dick.  But they were applauding him like crazy for that act.  I'm like, oh my god, I think he did that on the evening at the improv when Gordon jump-hosted.  Wow.  This is an old hack now.  I actually enjoyed it, and it's funny. 
[00:21:30]  Shut up!  My managers and I watched it, and we had a nice laugh together.  Yeah, oh, the common manager that you share with him?  You phony.  Jim's manager, Reuben Kincaid.  That Danny?  Nothing.  I laughed.  Oh, it's hacky.  Yeah, I laughed, though.  It's early for me.  I woke up to piss, and then I said, you know what?  Where's the hotline?  La Machine gave me the hotline, and Billy Mac gave me the hotline yesterday.  La Machine.  Are you going to even...  So yesterday I got the new hotline, and I'm calling today.  Are you going to remember even calling us later today? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm not Steve-O.  Oh, you heard the Steve-O?  I hear every day.  It's my favorite, dude.  You guys are my boys.  That guy's out of his mind.  All right, well...  I love that goddamn show, that Wild Boys show.  Yeah.  It's hysterical.  Oh, I've never seen it.  Oh, it's on MTV, too.  They send Steve-O and that other guy, what's his name?  Chris.  Chris Pontius.  Joe.  Pontius.  Pontius.  And they send him off to, like, Africa and South America to...  Oh, my God.  ...to, like, do things with animals.  Like, you would think Marlon Perkins, the old Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom, they do 
[00:22:30]  it, but only instead of just hanging out and filming them, they're, like, smacking animals  in the face and eating their crap and trying to pull dingleberries off their asses, getting  kicked in the face, getting ripped apart.  One time, Steve-O put a fish in his ass and had a pelican, like, pecking at it, and it  just grabbed his ass cheek and ripped it, and he's screaming, enough with that fucking  bird.  It's hysterical.  The guy's completely out of his mind.  I finally saw Jackass, the movie. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, it's hilarious.  Oh, it's hysterical.  That scene, when they're on the golf course with those air horns, dude, I never get to  laugh out loud.  That made me fucking laugh.  I howled watching that.  Oh, it's just pissing those golfers off.  And it all pulls the air horns.  I'd do that with the car horn every golf course I'd pass.  I did it yesterday with the car horn.  I took my son to the zoo, and you guys go past the Griffith Park, there's, like, a golf  course there on the way.  Yeah.  And guys are just lined up on their tee shots, and I'm just blaring the horn at him. 
[00:23:30]  It is fun to do.  How old is your son?  Two and a half.  Oh, cool.  Two and a half already.  We've been off the air a long time.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Holy crap.  Six, four, two, twenty.  I remember the announcement on our program.  He's a big fuck.  Is he?  Yeah.  I was at the zoo, and the gorillas are closed, because it's under construction.  And you know when you have construction, you put the wall up, but you have those little  circles, so the guys can, like, peek through the holes, just look at the trucks and  stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the entire construction crew is black. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.  And they're, like, on lunch break, and, like, the biggest, fattest one was, like, sitting  on a cooler, like, facing the other way, like one of them always does.  I remember thinking to myself, they have to know.  Oh, my God.  Like, they have to know how ridiculous this is.  Like, you're just sitting there, like, one's facing the other way, two are arguing.  Oh, that is wrong.  One's asshole is turned inside out. 
[00:24:30]  It's like a long-enclosed, except with orange vests.  Oh, is that horrible?  Oh, so glad you're on satellite.  That is horrible.  I wish I got the stock before it was at 29.  This is why we moved the show, by the way, so we could get our calls in from L.A.  Hey, serious stock is at, like, $5.  Yeah, it went up.  It had a little bump, and then it went back down again.  Like, everyone gave it to Howard, Mel Carmas, and bump up to, like, $9. 
[00:25:00]  And then, boom.  I had a radio tour that I did for these two dates.  It didn't work, obviously.  But the last one was serious, and I blew it off.  So when I spoke to you guys, I could say, nope, didn't do it.  I could not go on serious before I talked to you guys.  Where'd you cancel?  Just Easton and New Brunswick?  That's not that bad, two things?  Those were the only two dates I had.  I don't go out anymore.  Oh, okay.  No?  Why would you?  Yeah, you've got to stay home with Nicky.  Why do you want to leave that? 
[00:25:30]  Damn, man.  How cool is that, Jay?  Come on.  Come on.  How pissed was Bobcat?  I don't know, dude.  I don't get involved.  Dude, you got involved, though.  That's what happened.  I don't know nothing, man.  I don't know nothing.  All right.  Don't give me the money, man.  Don't give me the money.  Give me Tahin.  You're going to fuck me, you're going to fuck him.  Come on.  Let us live your life for one minute.  How is it?  She's so hot that sometimes I lose my erection. 
[00:26:00]  Does that happen to you, girl?  Come full circle, huh?  No, it's never happened to me.  I've never had a chick that hot.  So hot, like, my dick kind of goes, what's going on here?  Time out.  Let's fuck this over.  This is like, she's throwing like 101 here.  It feels it's not even worthy.  Yeah, and that's never happened to me before.  Wow, that's awesome.  Was she still going out with Bobcat, though, when you moved in there?  No.  No?  They moved out and done their thing. 
[00:26:30]  They were done?  Yeah.  Yeah, the tabloids had a little field day with that one.  I like Jay Moore's Bizarre Love Triangle.  Love Triangle.  So, Jay.  Yes, sir.  You've got to come clean now.  Did you or did you not have sex with chocolate live on our show that day?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  Yeah.  It was in a Jason's studio.  The glass was really thick.  It was kind of dark in there, but we thought we were seeing it. 
[00:27:00]  We never got to the bottom of that one.  Jay did.  Yeah, no.  I fogged up the glass.  Those were before the New York Times over the Windows days.  Yeah, it was the old, in Scotzo's old studio.  Scott Muni.  God rest his soul.  Did he die?  Yeah, Scotzo passed on to the great DJ Booth in the Sky.  Scott Muni.  He's lit.  The lit out.  Hey, do you still...  His studio smells like ass.  What happened?  Scott Muni sounds like the guy with the voice box in South Park.  Do you still do Chris Penn? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  That's probably my favorite impression that anybody does.  And no one does that impression.  That's why I love it.  I don't care how mad you are at me, this side happens in the day, he's going to be at us.  Let's move some cars.  It looks like Sam's fucking hot car all up there.  There was a girl who worked in one of daddy's cars, this black chick, called herself Lady  E.  Was he pissed off?  I love Keitel in Reservoir Dogs. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Tim Roth is shot, and Buscemi goes, holy shit, is it bad as opposed to good?  We're a bad lieutenant.  Gentlemen, this series must go seven games.  The revenue money alone between those two towns, leave it on the mix.  Strawberry is going to break out.  I went to the game yesterday, and I looked out Strawberry in his eyes. 
[00:28:30]  And he fucking told me, he's saving it all for the big one.  Wow.  That is really good.  That's where you can go any other way.  Leave it on the mix.  Did I see you wrong?  Good.  You owe me money.  Fucking, no one does Harvey Keitel and Chris Penn.  That is right on the money.  No one does that.  I love it with crazy logic, and then the fucking cops go, all right, fuck it, I'm in.  He's like, I saw Dastro, man, I put him in his eyes. 
[00:29:00]  All right, you know what?  I didn't know that.  All right, fuck it, I'm in.  All right, fuck it, I'm in.  Goddamn, that is funny.  Women get raped every day.  Now, because these two wear opinion suits, the church puts up a big reward.  The church is a record.  Are you a Catholic?  I'm a fucking Catholic.  I'm blessed.  You don't understand.  This guy's going to blow up your house with your family in it.  God, you're going to be doing me a fucking favor. 
[00:29:30]  Daniel, you're going to be a Catholic.  I'm good.  Holy shit.  Good life.  Good life, Daniel.  Good life.  Chris Penn and the Penn State.  A couple beautiful girls.  What were you tonight, Kit Kat club?  A couple beautiful girls in your daddy's car?  Huh?  I know what you did.  A couple beautiful girls.  I like when you actually see and Jay do the Chris Penn one, and you actually spit like  he does.  You're going to tell me this guy's going to decide? 
[00:30:00]  Out of the fucking mood.  Why are you telling me what we're doing?  I'm hilarious.  Don't put that gun on my daddy.  My daddy.  What the hell for all?  That lump of shit's working for the IMPD.  Joe, I don't know what you think you know.  You're wrong.  He's a good kid.  He got shot in the gut.  It's my fault he got shot in the gut. 
[00:30:30]  I know all the dialogue.  That's great.  Are you going to bark all day, little buggy, or am I going to be on a sitcom on basic cable  once in a year?  What was that?  Because I didn't catch it.  Am I going to be on tilt for 15 grand a week?  What a zilch, Michael Matthews.  Oh, shit.  And we're both again. 
[00:31:00]  West Palm.  Oh, West Palm this weekend.  I wanted to watch you perform, tell you jokes.  There would be a couple beautiful girls in the audience.  Goddamn.  It's very similar to Colin, actually, Kitell.  Laugh my ass off.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that is fucking hilarious.  Colin would be like, Jim, you know, that's the only thing you're performing at West Palm  with Jim Norton.  Bunch of people sitting around. 
[00:31:30]  It's good.  I'm a love sponge.  Jim Norton's on stage.  Oh, Colin.  You know?  I was going to fight with Bubba the Love Sponge in studio.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Why did you try to take his bag away from him?  He kept playing, like, these song parodies with the word nigger in them.  Really?  And he would dump it out for, like, all the listeners and everyone on hold, because I hear  it, and everyone in the studio is, like, cackling, laughing.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  I'm like, dude, it's just, it's not cool.  It's just not good.  It can't do it.  He's like, oh, what are you going to do, and they speak in, like, this bizarre language  called sats.  Jay, what was the problem?  No, that's when he stopped.  Oh, because then he stopped, and there was no more fun.  No, but with Walter, you know, my road manager's black, and my godson's black.  I'm like, did I just, you know, like, in high school, I would have loved you, but now it's  different.  Well, your zoo construction side story kind of blows that whole theory out of the water, 
[00:32:30]  Jay.  No, come on.  Serena Williams is my favorite thing in the world.  I want to fuck Serena Williams so bad.  You do?  Yeah.  You can do it now.  She's a beast.  You're a free man.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Are you completely free, or are you settling down with this Nicky girl?  No, we settled in.  What would you do?  Jesus Christ.  Well, she has something to do with it, I was thinking, and all right, she's into it, too, 
[00:33:00]  huh?  What are you going to do, like, go look for something better?  She's the hottest thing I've ever laid eyes on.  She talks and everything.  They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, and that's wrong.  The way to a man's heart is through his fucking washing machine.  Oh.  If you find a girl that does the laundry, forget it.  Yeah, you've got to love girls that do the laundry.  Laundry never ends.  I've been single four months, and it's like this. 
[00:33:30]  It's like having herpes.  Nicky Cox is doing your laundry?  Alley laundry.  I mean, yeah, doing both of your laundry?  I'm not going to be like, yeah, that's right.  Alley, no.  Oh.  She's done.  Alley laundry.  Wash my underwear.  Who works?  Yeah.  She's the best, dude.  I'm telling you.  She's really, her looks are like the least of her qualities.  Does she do the wash, like, in her underwear sometimes?  Mm-hmm.  Do the laundry, and you look over, and she's in her underwear. 
[00:34:00]  Isn't that the best?  Wow.  I'm telling you, I've never had a girl that was so hot, I lost my erection.  Wow.  Wow.  Jimmy?  I've seen her.  Like, I remember, I don't remember what she looked like, but I remember when I saw her,  I was like, Jesus, because I remember Goldthray, I was like, I can't believe he hooked up with  that beautiful girl.  So I don't remember what she looked like, but I know when I saw her, I was blown away.  She's kind of going to Google.  You could have been with anybody.  You would have thought that.  No, that's not true.  You'd be surprised what a few dollars can pick up.  I've made some nice purchases in the last couple of years. 
[00:34:30]  He's a nice guy, I'm sure.  Who?  Bob.  Yeah, I don't know him.  I've met him once.  I don't know the man.  I don't know what he does.  Yeah.  Just tell him you don't want to drink tab, he'll understand.  It must go seven games.  Oh, man.  Hey, Patty really crawled across the studio naked?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  She has come a long way, Jay.  Her new poor name, Patricia Brooks. 
[00:35:00]  The body wasn't that bad, considering.  For a 50-year-old broad.  It really wasn't that bad.  You've got to give it to her.  For an old broad.  For an old broad.  Hey, hell, it's no Nicky Cox, but you know what?  We had to start this whole thing over again, and we're not getting the talent yet, Jay.  So even a stalker patty naked is better than nothing.  Oh, that is a good starting point, because really, you know,  you could really improve upon that.  We had that Polish girl in the other day, though.  Do you have any guests coming in today? 
[00:35:30]  Huh?  Do you have any guests coming in today?  No, this is pretty much it.  Really?  You're it.  Hey, Ben, don't you think as a producer of the show,  it's kind of your job to line up guests?  Dude, we have a professional booker.  She can't even get the job done.  Where's Ben?  I want to hear Ben's response to that.  We hear about who was supposed to be on the show, is what we hear.  We were supposed to have, who was the big star we were supposed to have the other day?  Vin Diesel.  Vin Diesel was supposed to be on.  So that was kind of cool.  He stood us up.  That he didn't show.  Instead, you got the duck. 
[00:36:00]  Who?  From his Pacifier movie.  From his bad movie.  There you go.  Yeah, I booked the duck from Pacifier.  And we were supposed to have Chris Jericho today, but he overslept.  What?  Is that what we're hearing?  Yeah, there's an excuse every day why these people don't show up.  There is an excuse every day.  Why these people don't show up on our show.  Well, if he overslept, that means he's up now.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  He's not oversleeping.  He overslept.  He'll still be sleeping.  Was that Voss?  No.  Why, did you hear some slurping sound? 
[00:36:30]  You know what's amazing?  What amazes me about Voss, after working with him for two years on Last Comic Standing,  is for a guy that can't speak, all of his bits end in words he can't say.  Like, I owe her money and I'm dodging her.  Dodging her.  Like, he couldn't say avoiding, which he can say flawlessly.  Next time you have him on, try to get him to say, I eat sushi in church on Tuesday.  And then just get the Gallagher tarp and cover yourself up. 
[00:37:00]  The Gallagher tarp.  There she is.  He's trying to say something.  And if he does try to say it, he'll, like, he has to pop and swallow first.  Jesus.  Hey, we're looking at pictures of your squeeze.  We popped up a couple of pics on Google.  Look at him.  In your face.  In your face.  You're a pisser.  I'm sorry about it, Parker.  That's very, very nice. 
[00:37:30]  She's the best, dude.  Good job.  Good job, Jay.  You've done good.  You've done good.  She's loving it.  The series must go seven games.  All right.  All right, you bastard.  Hey, get in here, though, one day.  You've got to come and stop in when you're in New York.  Dude, I will do nothing else other than your show.  And I canceled Sirius yesterday because I would never be able to look you in the eye knowing that I did that bullshit company before I did you.  Thank you, Jay.  Ozzy's going to be there one day? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I hope so, yeah.  He's supposed to be.  He better be.  Hopefully he won't oversleep.  All right.  Jimmy's going to be like a babbling schoolgirl.  Oh, dude.  I'm going to be just an ass.  I have to prepare questions because I'll have nothing to say, like, spur of the moment.  Do you remember that Bugs Bunny with the Sinatra rooster and the Bing Crosby rooster are, like, competing and all the chickens are just like,  They're swooning, yeah.  And shooting eggs up their ass.  That's Jimmy.  Yeah, I really will be a blithering idiot. 
[00:38:30]  Jim, what's the number to West Palm Beach if somebody wanted to get tickets to your show?  I honestly don't have it in front of me.  I should.  Oh, my God.  No, I don't think about plugs when I'm on this program.  I just think about having fun and doing the show.  So it's the West Palm Beach Improv?  Yeah, so tomorrow through Saturday.  So if you went to, like, improv.com, for example.  Like, if I'm online right now, let me just figure out how to route this through.  It might be improv comedy clubs or improvclubs.com.  Or you can go to eatabullet.com and link to it from my calendar page.  Oh, that's your website, eatabullet.com? 
[00:39:00]  561-833-1812.  That's the number of your website?  No, that's the number of, no, you can't call a website.  That's the number of the improv.  Oh, I got confused.  So the West Palm Beach Improv is what?  561-833-1812.  1812?  Yeah.  A lot of big laps.  Yes, sir.  I miss you, buddy.  I miss you, Jay.  We always have fun.  I miss eating fried raviolis at Joey Paisano.  Hey, we'll go to Paisano on Mulberry Street. 
[00:39:30]  Have some fried raviolis.  Oh, let me tell you a quick Frenchie story, okay?  Why are you called to say fuck you?  And I know you guys probably have to take some kind of break, right?  Not really.  Something.  We can just keep going.  How many times has Frenchie come to my shows for free and just sat there in the dressing  room, like drooling, going, yes, you come to my restaurant.  It's very good.  Like every single time, all he does is ask me to go to his restaurant, right?  Yeah.  Do you ever go?  Yeah.  Hence the story to follow. 
[00:40:00]  Okay.  So, but I admire your enthusiasm.  Just moving it along, Jay.  So, when my book comes out, I get the publishers in New York and everything, and I'm going to  take them all out to dinner, and I'm like, I know just the place.  So, I get all these people from Hyperion and like three of my friends, and we go to Frenchie's  restaurant.  He's like a fucking, he's like Eric Roberts in Pope of Greenwich Village Waiter.  Like, he's that low on the totem pole, and he always makes it like it's his restaurant. 
[00:40:30]  Like, he's just a bum.  He's not, there's two waiters in there.  He's not even our waiter.  And then at the end of the night, he comes over, and he puts a fucking $300 check in front  of me.  And I literally did like a pesky, like, you're going to embarrass me, make me look like a  schmuck in front of my friends.  He should have clobbered him over the head with a bottle.  Hey, you wanted me to Christian as kid to split.  Seven, seven grand I charge.  He gave me a fucking $300 check, and I'm like, what?  Yes, I took off the ice cream.  Like, something was free, and it made it worse. 
[00:41:00]  I've gone there many, many times with many, many people, and I have never, ever gotten  a break on the check.  I went in there one time, I got a free dessert.  That's why I never went back.  Yeah.  For what?  Yeah, but he's always, like, talking it up.  Like, he owns it, and come on in, I'll whine you, I'll dine you.  Yeah, you think...  Oh, with Joey, you leave with more money than you came in with. 
[00:41:30]  Sunday, you picked up a check for nine of us, Joey.  Yeah.  Nine of us.  I was just looking for a slight break.  Well, you can do that when you work in construction.  That's right.  In the sanitation business.  Yeah, I hear you.  I never got a break.  I kept going back many times because it was really good food, but, you know, what are  you going to do?  Really good food.  French food.  Stags.  West French food, but...  Hey, Jay, someone from Wagbag, they don't forget anything.  They want to know if you were begging to try to get on Howard's show, because Howard made 
[00:42:00]  a whole deal about that.  If I won?  Howard went off on a whole rant about you, saying that you were trying to beg to be on  his show.  No.  You bad-mouthed him in an interview.  Jay bad-mouthed him in an interview.  You bashed him.  Right, and then Howard claimed that you were begging to get on the show.  Well, he was saying, I think...  Hey, I don't pay for nobody.  Oh, wait, I got the clip.  Of Howard?  Yeah.  All right, let's listen.  This is the beauty of the new show, Jay.  We get to play all these clips. 
[00:42:30]  We play whatever we want.  That calls Howard.  I know what did happen is...  Hold on.  Sorry, I was going to take my mouth off.  I had phone calls from friends telling me that he was talking about me, and then I clicked  over and listened, and Gary was suggesting me as a guest, and Howard said, no, because  I don't know what I would talk to him about.  And it was really boring, and I turned it.  Well, here it is.  Here's the clip.  Hey, Mitch, you're on the air.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that Jay Moore ripped off one of your bits on Jimmy 
[00:43:00]  Kimmel last night.  Jesus.  What did he do?  Well, he was actually breathing while he was telling one of his jokes.  Oh, very funny.  Very funny.  The guy bashed him.  Nailed him.  He walked right into it.  Yeah, Howard's all happy, thinking he's got one of these stupid ripped me off things  again.  He was actually breathing.  Did he hear that, Jay?  I invented that, Robin.  That's awesome.  Let me tell you about Marconi, Robin.  Yeah, you do great, Howard.  It makes me happy when you do that.  Thank you, Jay Moore.  It continues. 
[00:43:30]  Listen.  Telling one of his jokes, kind of like you do.  I think you invented that.  Hey, Jay, why don't you stop calling the show?  You're not coming on ever.  Also, at this point, Howard thinks...  Oh, yeah, I did do this.  I was like, is this kind of delusional?  I think I called it myself.  Of course.  I forgot to...  Yeah.  Howard thinks he's talking to Jay Moore.  That's what makes this so beautiful.  Kidding.  Yeah, now we've got to start over.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, because the guy sounds so much like me.  What a lunatic.  Hey, Mitch, you're on the air.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that Jay Moore ripped off one of your bits on Jimmy 
[00:44:00]  Kimmel last night.  What did he do?  He was actually breathing while he was telling one of his jokes, kind of like you do.  I think you invented that.  Yeah, boy.  Hey, Jay, why don't you stop calling the show?  You're not coming on ever.  Oh, my God.  You'd think he'd have more to do.  Yeah.  Do you think he's serious?  Isn't Jay the comic who tried for years to get on our show and then trashed me on the  Opie and Anthony show?  Absolutely.  Yeah, well, F him.  He stood on the side of the MTV Awards. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  He stood there, not unlike Jim Carrey ten years earlier, you know, just waiting to get  on the show.  Yeah, so Jim got on and Jay didn't.  Right.  And so...  I'm a loser like Jim Carrey.  You're a loser like the guy that makes 20 mil a picture.  You know, I can't take it anymore.  Like, every once in a while, I like the show, but I just can't take... 
[00:45:00]  I mean, I know they all get paid to agree with him, but it gets to a point where it's  just awful.  Yeah, how about once in a while, just not agreeing with the guy?  We were saying that earlier, man.  The blacks don't want to work, Robin.  I know.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  You think he'd have better things to do than call a show?  He does, because that isn't him.  Jesus Christ, you idiot.  Let me hear it again.  That guy sounds nothing like me.  He sounds like one of my uncles.  It continues.  And so, you know, boo-hoo.  Boo-hoo.  So, after being a super fan, he trashes me, because he's got no goddamn convictions or 
[00:45:30]  morality or anything.  You hurt his feelings.  Yeah, I hurt his feelings, because he's such a scary talent.  Now he's doing star search.  No, I'm having such a sneaky costume, babe.  God damn.  He's right about the morality, though.  Yeah, you don't have any morality, that's for sure, but Jesus.  You're having a good time, though. 
[00:46:00]  What a tool.  It continues.  Now he's doing star search.  Great.  Good luck.  By the way, I have to take back what I said about that show.  I watched the rest of it.  It was abominable.  All right.  Boy, New York comedians were really bad.  Really?  Oh, my goodness.  How good is a comedian going to be on television when you're not allowed to say anything?  I mean, seriously, think about it.  Well, they did do some bleeping, but, man.  And bleeping always makes everything funny. 
[00:46:30]  Well, it made Ozzy funny, so I guess the comedians thought it would help them.  He's probably grumpy and tired.  Oh, always.  Always.  He's just calling it in at this point.  Sirius has no idea how bad that deal really is.  They have no clue yet.  His half a billion dollar deal.  Jesus.  Just being honest.  Yeah, I don't understand how they're going to make that work.  That's some serious cash.  Man, you've got to give him that.  You're making some real money.  Yes.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Yes, Jay. 
[00:47:00]  Did he get us?  Are you getting me?  I think he got us.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was the reverse silent game.  Jay, I...  Yes.  Hopi, uh, no more, I don't know, uh, no more Shandy?  No, we're done, too.  All right.  Yeah, Jay, uh, Jay, well, dude, you got Nikki.  Well, I don't even, honestly, I don't even care.  I mean, yeah, it's over.  It's over.  It seemed like it was a tough time off for everybody, it seems like. 
[00:47:30]  She broke up with me, uh, five weeks after we got, uh, canceled.  So, I lost...  This was probably the first time you ever had to talk to each other.  No shit.  I lost my career and, uh, and my chick all within, like, a month, month and a half, yeah.  And we were coming home...  I mean, I knew we had problems, and we were coming home from Montreal, and I looked over  at her, and I go, wow, you're just not into this anymore.  She goes, yeah, you're right.  Wow, really?  Was that how it happened?  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  Ouch.  Is she seeing anybody now?  I don't know.  I don't really care. 
[00:48:00]  I don't care, Robert.  No, that wasn't the thing for me.  I was, you know, for me.  What?  What?  I've been having a fine time since, so I don't really care.  And then Dice, and then Dice, uh, his whole thing broke up, and then Barry Williams, his,  uh, his, his, uh, marriage broke up.  Dice and Barry Williams were going out?  I didn't know that.  Barry, the Barry Williams one, I'm, I'm scared to call him another friend of the show,  but that thing sounds a little, uh, little, little too strange to get into.  Because I, I knew, uh, I, I knew the Williams pretty well from, you know, hanging out in 
[00:48:30]  L.A.  I, I've hung with them a bunch of times, and then when they came to New York, they seem  like a very, very happy couple.  And then it makes the tabloids that, uh, they're getting a divorce, and that she wants full custody,  and, and she only wants a nanny around when, uh, when, uh, Barry sees his own son.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking, wow, something really bad had to happen there.  Yeah, because the son's 16.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Well done, Paul.  Thank you.  So we haven't gotten to the bottom of that one.  I don't know if we ever will, but. 
[00:49:00]  Well, you should just have all your friends that are getting divorced on the show.  Well, no, I mean, it's, it's unbelievable, you know?  You, Barry, Dice.  But you know what makes up for it all?  Voss is getting married.  Me, right, my, my relationship, uh, broke up, uh, Ben's, yeah, Ben's did, Ben's did,  Steve's, uh, Will.  Steve.  He just doesn't know it yet.  How many more teams?  Black girl and his dungeon master.  My girl. 
[00:49:30]  Earl.  I haven't had a relationship.  Well, you're, you're a smart man, I guess.  I settle down with a different girl every night.  Yeah, don't pay any more religious prices.  Hey, but it sounds much nicer than Italian.  Yeah, you know what?  I had a, one dog looking one way, one looking the other guy in the middle saying, what  do you want from me?  Hey, he runs by seven right now, don't he?  Jay, I had a really weird two years, I gotta tell you, man.  It was weird.  Well, tell us now.  Well, I, I've brought up most of them.  It started with, uh, before we got fired, like a month before we got fired, my grandma 
[00:50:00]  died, who was like a, uh, a mother figure to me, okay?  So she dies.  That's not funny.  No, I, I know.  Then I lose the, uh, the career.  Then I lost the, uh, the long-term chick.  Then my, um, my best friend moves to LA.  Then my uncle drops.  And then I lost my dad four days after we signed this contract.  Like just one after another.  My whole life got completely turned upside down. 
[00:50:30]  The listeners are home on their soundboards hitting the laugh thing.  To get back at you.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  All right, I can do it to myself, you know, I, I, I, there you go.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I must say, I like that laugh, but I do kind of miss the Cape Fear one, and the, and the,  the short car crash is infinitely better than the long car crash.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Yep.  So, so look at it.  Which one's the short car crash?  That's this one. 
[00:51:00]  I agree.  That's by far.  What's the long one?  We had one a while ago.  The old one from the old show that just went on and on.  Oh, I like this one.  Big wreck.  Yeah, this one's great because there's that airbag top.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do hear that.  Oh, my God.  We're looking at Nikki Cox's pictures from FHM.  Jesus.  Wow.  Good.  She's all right.  God.  She's all right.  Good God, man.  She's all right.  That's a nice little top she's got on.  Is that in the laundry pile?  These guys are the best.  And it'll be like during like an awful patch of the show.  I'm like, no, seriously, they really are. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, there's a few of those.  Uncle Tom, he's got a dildo in her mouth.  No, no, no.  Seriously, they're really funny.  When they're not doing that, they're pretty clever, pretty entertaining.  Look at us all just catching up.  It's been way too long, Jay.  It certainly has.  Oh, Bubby.  Bubby.  So.  All right, Jim, West Palm Improv this weekend, right?  I will be there Thursday through Saturday, and I'm telling you, I just, I'm really going  to have some good jokes for the crowd.  There you go.  Oh, what kind of material do you do?  That's always my favorite question. 
[00:52:00]  Where do you get your ideas?  Well, why don't you bring it up?  I don't have a joke for that, but it's someone else up for it.  Well, Norton will be in West Palm.  Jay Moore will be in Nicky Cox, and, uh.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, Lord, are you the one that hates when people type?  Am I remembering correctly when you say laugh out loud?  LOL.  LOL, yeah, drives me nuts.  It makes me, I don't know if you've said all this before, so if you have, stop me. 
[00:52:30]  But when people type that, I want to fucking smash my keyboard.  Like, I'm really supposed to believe that you're typing and laughing maniacally every  fifth sentence.  Worse than that is the image of someone rolling on the floor laughing.  I only want to see that if their fucking apartment is on fire and they're trying to  survive.  Or LMAO laughing my ass off.  Yuck.  Maybe you can give me some free tickets, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll come by tomorrow, LOL.  It's like, what the fuck is funny about that?  I'll come by tomorrow. 
[00:53:00]  No, I won't.  Yeah, it's awful.  Just kidding, wink, send me calling in the fucking smaller than size.  That makes me sick.  J.K., J.K.  What's that?  That's just kidding.  Oh, really?  Well, you type, and then you have to type back G.A.  That's the response.  And what was that?  Get AIDS.  A big bucket of AIDS, like chum.  All right, J.D.  What's Connor up to these days, Jim?  Who's that? 
[00:53:30]  Connor.  Little Connor?  Yeah.  Oh, you were listening to all that, too, huh?  What a hit that was.  That was the T-shirt that said, Dad's Little Chum.  Dad's Little Chum.  Oh, that's awful.  Yeah, we went through quite the phase.  And the Ramon promos is probably the lowest you guys have ever gotten.  Ramon.  I love that one.  From the listeners.  Oh, I know.  That was bad.  With that, like, God of Thunder synthesizer voice.  Just awful, cheesy voice that was on there. 
[00:54:00]  Really bad.  Another day outside under the blue sky.  Ramon.  Give me your thumb.  Like, it didn't even make sense.  It didn't make sense.  That was awful.  You guys, who entered the phone, Eric?  Danny.  Danny.  Danny.  We pretty much have a whole new crew that works for us, too.  Danny.  Danny.  I've got to go on my lawn. 
[00:54:30]  No answering the phones.  That's the important thing.  We, uh...  Well, the world needs two stickers.  We got rid of a bunch of people and brought in some new blood there, Jay.  All right.  Well, tell them I'm in the hood now.  I'm calling.  All right.  Yeah, we moved Steve up, and we moved Ben up.  Stinky's working somewhere else, doing very well.  And there you have it.  And Rick Delgado's in the unemployment line humming the tsunami song.  What an idiot.  Yeah.  A tree right through her head. 
[00:55:00]  Jay, we're on satellite radio, and we're paranoid every day.  That guy, the first chance he got went right for the thing that would get you fired.  Screaming chinks.  Hello.  I was in the press release when it listed all the people's names that got laid off  and, uh, fined.  It was like Lady Diva X.  Yeah.  And, uh...  I guess he was on, like, a hot 97-type program.  Yeah, a hip-hop station.  Todd Lynn got in big trouble for that, too.  He lost everything, man.  He had a deal at ABC or some network.  He lost.  Todd lost...  Who?  You know Todd Lynn, Black Comic? 
[00:55:30]  No.  He was on 97, but that tsunami song, he was the guy that said that I'm going to go shoot Asians.  Great.  Yeah, yeah.  He lost everything.  And the Greaseman's back, right?  Is he?  Really?  Yeah, he's doing something similar.  Oh, he's terrific.  Is he on commercial radio or is he still just buying time?  Because I know he buys time.  Like, he goes to a radio station and goes,  I need about two hours of programming time for the Greaseman show.  And then he pays for it, and then he goes out to businesses and sells airtime, 
[00:56:00]  sells his own time to try to recoup the money.  So you go out to the local chicken place, or, you know...  Yeah, Popeye's a fried chicken.  Go down there and get a wingie.  And there he is hawking goods to try to pay for the airtime that he bought.  So it's like an infomercial, but it's his show that he puts commercials on.  That's brilliant, actually.  It really is clever.  I mean, he was a genius here.  Not bad.  At least he's back.  Yes, Jay. 
[00:56:30]  He got us good.  That was a good one.  Hey, guys, listen.  And we listened.  That was a good one.  You got to give it to him.  That was a very, very funny phone call.  Jay was inspired to him.  That was good.  Fucking Chris Penn and Keitel.  Very funny.  Well, slowly but surely getting the band back together.  Yeah.  Very funny.  I said some bad things about Jay, but, you know...  Well, you know, you love Jay, man.  You were hurt because you didn't call in.  Like, why did the guy kind of abandon the show? 
[00:57:00]  You were hurt.  It wasn't that you don't like Jay.  Definitely pissed off that we didn't get him on sooner.  That's all.  Same with Dice.  I mean, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  People say things.  They lash out when they're wounded or hurt.  That's all it is.  It's like a relationship.  Say things you later want to take back.  Yeah.  Jay, if you're still listening, I'm sorry.  Aw.  You wounded me.  Jay was very nice to me when I was in L.A. and doing Last Comic Standing and in New York.  All right.  Cool.  He was very good.  Unlocked and free for the masses, this is the worst of O&A. 
[00:57:30]  So nice not having to bleep out the curse word.  On XM's High Voltage.  What a stupid name.  O&A.  The other O.B. and Anthony interlock.  Wow.  So, okay.  I don't know this side.  XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly here with another O.B. and Anthony interlockular.  The worst of O&A.  New freaks that are showing up from the XM Nation.  Ones that aren't part of the regular crew.  Well, we got Jim, the guy that got hit by a boat.  He was hit in the head with a boat when he was a teen. 
[00:58:00]  He's in his 30s now, I guess.  And he's just a mess.  I don't mean to laugh, but.  He's trying to get laid and he can't make that work out for him.  He's got all kinds of problems with his vision.  And he just decided to call one day and let everybody know that that's what his life is all about.  But he has a good nature.  He has a good nature.  And he touched boobies a couple weeks ago.  A couple of weeks ago.  I was very happy for him.  But, yeah, you get people like that.  Wheelchair Fred, who we've known for years since the old Boston days. 
[00:58:30]  He's rejoined the show on the phone.  And that's just a nightmare.  And then various girls that have come up into the studio.  Things like that.  And we get a constant little rotation of freaks that come through.  Let's not forget Pat from Munaki.  Pat from Munaki, the guy that won the eggnog drinking competition and then puked it all up into a big garbage pail.  Diabetic.  He lost a little toe.  Diabetes.  300 pounds diabetic with rosacea.  A real enchanting group of people we get on this fucking awful show.  Isn't it great? 
[00:59:00]  Just makes us feel better about ourselves, you know.  The fat bald man with a red face.  Slappable.  Nine toes.  Nine toes.  That last one just toppling off his foot looking like a raisinet.  He plinked around in his sock like a little pebble when you're at the beach.  My shoe.  Oh, it's a toe.  Call a toe truck.  When does the National WOW Tour happen nationwide in a giant tour bus? 
[00:59:30]  Well, coast to coast.  Depending on when they're hearing our voices, it might have begun already.  Because April was the official kickoff of WOW.  April is really the first month of WOW for us here in New York.  Around the country, you know, some places.  Nice and warm.  But here in New York, we like spring when it's nice and warm and the girls can start wearing something lighter.  Easier accessibility.  And then guys put the WOW on the vehicle.  It's a sticker you can get from sending a self-addressed stamped envelope here to our studios at... 
[01:00:00]  111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019.  And then you put the sticker on your car.  Or you can just write WOW in the dirt in the back of your truck or something.  And girls that are familiar with this program and WOW, they drive up.  They see the WOW.  They drive up next to you.  And as you're driving your commute home, maybe you're stuck in traffic, you turn your head and all of a sudden there's a chick flashing you.  And you go, why?  What the?  Why is she?  Oh, yeah.  I had a WOW on the vehicle.  And you realize you've just been WOWed.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Are you planning a national tour?  Do you want to do the national tour? 
[01:00:30]  Sure.  We ought to do our road shows.  We'll get those things back in order.  We need a few more freaks, a few more interesting freaks before we take it out on the road.  But, yeah, WOW kind of is something that just happens.  We don't have to be there.  It doesn't have to be a special occasion kind of thing.  It just happens on your commute home.  That's what makes it so easy.  But as far as things like us touring and stuff, yeah, we love doing that.  We'll do it eventually.  Hit the market.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Today on XM202 High Voltage. 
[01:01:00]  Ah, this is when the ONA Army attacked the Tony Danza message board, Anthony.  No message board is safe when the ONA Army is unleashed upon it.  It is a battalion of mongoloids we send out to battle our battles.  Whether it's message boards, other radio shows, we have them call in and just disrupt the show.  They are what we love to call pests.  Pests.  Just pests.  And this is, I remember this was one of the hardest I have laughed since we've been on the air. 
[01:01:30]  I fucking howled.  It's some of the clever little names they come up with to post on these message boards.  And you just know how obnoxious they're being and how repulsed other people are by reading it.  Right.  Look for many appearances by Lil' Connor Peterson.  At this point, why don't we plug in a couple of the message boards.  We love whackbag.com.  Cringehumor.net.  OpieAnthony.net.  Oh my god.  Oavirus.com.  FuckJimmy.com. 
[01:02:00]  Wildfans.com.  EatABullet.com.  That's your personal site.  No, no, no.  That's a big message board site.  They can go to whackbag from there.  It's the worst.  So, everyone wants the Tony Danza update, Anthony.  Oh.  Yesterday, once again, we went to the line of people that were waiting to get into the Tony  Danza show.  Yes.  Anthony does an amazing Tony Danza impression.  Thank you.  He didn't even know he could do it, but one day he tried it and it worked.  You just got to sound stupid. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  So, we've been messing with the line ever since we started on XM Satellite Radio from  time to time, and these stupid rubes, pretty much from the Midwest, were believing they  were actually talking to Tony Danza, and then Tony Danza would get really rude and outrageous.  And ruin their little image of Tony Danza.  Basically, ask the old rubes for BJs before the show, so Tony could relax.  You think they're freaking out over there right now, listening, going, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  They might be coming to the line again.  So, yesterday, it got ugly.  You know, we were doing another one. 
[01:03:00]  I think it was our fourth, maybe.  Mm-hmm.  And all of a sudden, Eric was ready to leave, and pretty much, he said, there's a huge security  guard there that won't let him leave.  Yes.  Was knocking the phone out of his hand, and then Eric was trying to call the show, and  then he's hanging up the phone, and then he grabbed the phone away from him, and he  had Eric, he was holding Eric.  Yes.  And supposedly, they called the cops, and got very, very ugly yesterday.  We were on the phone with cop friends.  He was trying to have a little fun, right?  Master Poe wanted to run over there and break someone's neck. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  He was very, uh, very upset, let's just say.  I've heard he's been told that, uh, he's not allowed to call the cops.  Oh, really?  Well, he gets a little excited.  Because he's trying to protect us.  I understand that.  Yeah, that definitely wasn't a 911-type call.  So, the update, Eric, come in here real fast.  Or you can talk from there if you want.  What?  I think he was saying he can't talk from there.  Oh, okay.  For some reason.  Oh, Flaming Steve has taken his place at the helm. 
[01:04:00]  Well, for some reason, they can't hear that mic over the air, so.  Oh, all right.  It's going to be like a sauna after he's in there with that shirt for a couple of minutes.  It's like, it's like a steam room now in there.  Um, so, Eric, uh, I guess we all decided not to press charges and not to call the police  and get them involved, right?  Are you okay with that?  I'm fine with it.  That's what I was advised to do, and I agree with it.  Oh, advised.  Really?  Yeah.  Uh, had a couple of phone calls yesterday after the show, and, uh, it was advised that 
[01:04:30]  we don't do that.  Some police officers?  Yeah.  Yeah, because we would look kind of silly.  We would look silly.  And nerdy.  We need something really good if we're going to, you know, involve the cops.  Right.  Something like just a little, little shoulder shaking.  All the crap we get away with, we can handle if one of our guys gets slightly roughed up.  Right?  That's fine.  Yeah, I have no problem with it.  Okay.  Roughed up.  My only problem is now we can't work the line anymore.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We will.  Yeah.  That's why we're smart. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Just when you think, uh, it's over, Johnny, you, you, you watch what happens next.  All right, good.  Jason, go ahead.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, uh, you got to continue the bit?  Because that's definitely worth a delay.  Um, yeah, we got some ideas.  We might take it, uh, to the next level.  Sweet.  Because, you know, to sit there and listen to those frigging clowns go, oh, woo, hi, and  she's creaming in her shorts, you know, it's just classic.  Yeah, I got a backup plan, actually.  Sweet. 
[01:05:30]  I kind of know that area.  I got a backup plan.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you, Jason.  So, yeah.  That's the update, pretty much.  Mm-hmm.  And we should, we should go right into the applause breaks.  This is one of our favorite things to do on the new show, Anthony.  Oh, when we're done with the show here, at the end of the show, uh, we turn on the Tony  Danza show, and, uh, he comes out, and, uh, before he does his monologue, or as he's doing  his monologue, we count how many applause breaks there are.  These rubes that come to see him will clap at anything. 
[01:06:00]  The drop-up of Tony's hat, and they're clapping.  And, uh, we're amazed at the, the nonsense that comes out of his mouth and the applause  that it gets from, from the audience.  And this is only one show.  One show.  Every day, every day there's about 10 to 12 applause breaks for stupid crap.  Yeah.  Absolutely stupid crap that, uh, crap that means nothing.  Nothing.  And this is what makes good TV these days, I guess.  I guess so.  So, here's today's Tony Danza applause breaks. 
[01:06:30]  We'll stop after each one.  We'll start with this.  And, uh, thanks for tuning in at home.  Uh, that was my son outside, putting up the wreath with us.  Uh, my little, I have, I had him on my shoulders for a while.  And then I realized the last time he was on my shoulders, he was four.  So, you know, kind of crazy.  Um, how's everyone?  I hope everyone's okay.  Yeah, yeah, enjoy it.  Yeah, nice to see you all.  Uh, oh, my son, uh, last time he was on my shoulders, he was four. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, huh, huh, huh, huh.  How is everyone today?  Good.  Oh.  Just chop meat hands when they leave.  And here's another one.  And then I got some mixed olives.  I threw the olives in there, too.  Let them go for a while.  And then I put in the tilapia.  The tilapia was laying in there, and it came out fabulous.  I mean, really.  So, that's my new dish now.  It's called tilapia with olives. 
[01:07:30]  Tilapia.  Oh, my God.  They're clapping at that.  and he milked it.  He was trying so hard to get him.  Tilapia and olives.  Tilapia.  Tilapia.  Tilapia.  They're applauding a fish.  A tilapia pussy would be fantastic right now.  Tilapia.  Is that what tilapia is, a fish?  Yeah, I think so.  He goes into these Guido Dago cooking things.  I swear to God, he is the equivalent of if a black guy gets on TV 
[01:08:00]  and just starts going, will the lordy, lordy, where be my water melon?  All right, so you're saying he's very typical Tony Danza.  Yes.  He is.  He's like a, it's so stereotypical Dago Wap things.  He's German-Irish.  Listen to me, my Kraut McFriend.  Listen to this one.  There's talk of a bread intervention at my house. 
[01:08:30]  Because I just, Puglieses are going like crazy.  I'm eating like a madman.  I want to lead the, I'm leading the no-low-carb diet.  That's me.  I'm on the, I'm going the other way.  What?  See, everyone else is on a low-carb diet, so.  I'm doing the no-low-carb diet.  So Tony, who doesn't have an ounce of fat on him,  he's pretty much saying that he's out of control, he's eating bread,  and he's going to start this new revolution, the no-carb, what is it?  No-low-carb diet.  No-low-carb diet.  I go along with my diet, my complete, I'm off any kind of talent for my whole life. 
[01:09:00]  I've been dieting, and I haven't touched talent in quite a while.  The funny part about that, then they show the crowd, and they're all fat pigs.  Yeah, big slobs.  And if Tony says it's okay to eat bread, we're going to eat bread now again.  Right, Tony said.  Tony doesn't eat bread.  Tony works out like an animal, probably.  Like an animal, yeah.  He probably has a dietician, he probably counts every single calorie. 
[01:09:30]  Sure.  Yeah, Tony's stuffing his face with bread, of course he is.  And then he has the nerve to face these fat pigs.  I mean, they're all just fat pigs, and when they show the audience shot, and he's trying  to tell them that he's gaining a little weight.  Yeah.  As these ladies have their hands rested on their bunts, waiting to applause again.  On their bunts, applause, applause.  I am a little bit heavy.  We have Nikki Kimbrough here today.  I am.  I'm a little over.  You can just feel it. 
[01:10:00]  It's just a little.  You know how things.  No.  No.  No, Tony.  I'm not going to let you see, lady.  And they're applausing over that.  More applausing.  You know where he's overweight?  In the front of that Spider-Man costume.  Big hog.  That's where the weight was coming from on Halloween.  A big hog.  Yeah.  No, I'm feeling a little, you know.  A little floated.  No, Tony.  No.  Not you.  No.  You're our superhero.  How bittersweet for him. 
[01:10:30]  He knows that he could just grab any one of those women and just huddle, but look at them.  Just look at them.  That's his life.  And our life is better?  Yeah.  Have you seen who comes to see us?  All guys.  All guys.  We get porn stars that we can go home with for a thousand bucks.  All right.  Well, now, here's an applause break for laundry, Anthony.  What?  Laundry.  And so, I just want to tell you all, I'm happy with my laundry. 
[01:11:00]  I don't know why I told that story.  I'm happy with my laundry.  And that gets an applause break.  Well, look how long it's going.  Oh, they're just excited.  Yeah, I'm happy with my, you know, my housekeeper washes the skid marks out now.  I had flu underwear laying on the floor, and she came over and cleaned it up, picked it up with her bare hands.  It was amazing. 
[01:11:30]  Unbelievable.  They were applausing.  Applausing.  I was with you.  His laundry.  Yeah.  This is my favorite one, and the last one for today.  All right.  There's another five, but this one is just amazing.  She's not the only one with fans in prison, though.  I want to say hello to all my friends at Raway, my fans and friends at Raway.  I know you're watching.  I got a, it was on the message board, but I have fans at Raway prison. 
[01:12:00]  They watch it, and they watch it Raway every day.  I'm so, it's.  Raway.  Yeah.  Speaking of that message board.  Yeah.  The gang from our message board, whackbag.com, has completely taken over the thing.  Oh, yeah.  They went to the Tommy Danza message board and just tracked it.  And what?  Uh, opianthony.net, right?  Okay, opianthony.net, another message board.  They've completely taken it over.  Trash.  The O&A Army.  The O&A Army were a little pissed off how a sex bagel was treated, so they took it upon 
[01:12:30]  themselves.  We didn't say it, and they just went for a major attack on the message board.  You could just see those roofs that want to write, you know, I enjoy your program, Tony.  You are what?  And they're just being called the C word.  Oh, it's just ugly over there right now.  Screen names like Norton's Beef Tits.  Yeah.  That's actually somebody's email name, Norton's Beef Tits.  We had, we had Howard, we had Howard Stern's message board shut down because he couldn't  take the abuse, and now I guarantee the Tony Danza thing is going to be shut down as well. 
[01:13:00]  I'm shutting it down.  Yes, sex bagel.  I'll email you guys the links, but I went on there last night to the Tony Danza board.  Yeah.  They swap recipes.  They talk about experiences about sitting in the audience, and like, I'm going to go  to this show.  Let's all meet up at some place before the show and introduce each other.  His message board or ours?  I was going to say, that sounds a lot like our message board.  I've seen the same post on whackbag.com.  Hey, going to Cleveland?  Yeah.  Before the passion of O&A, let's all meet at Fridays. 
[01:13:30]  I've seen it.  Yeah, same thing.  Why don't we get one of the interns to get some of the better slams from the Tony Danza  message board?  If we can.  So anyway, he's, why is he thanking prison?  He's thanking the gang at Raway.  At Raway?  In between dropping the soap, I guess these guys were listening to Tony Danza, or listening,  watching Tony Danza in the weight room.  And he was serious.  It wasn't like a joke or anything.  He's seriously thanking prisoners.  She's not the only one with fans in prison, though. 
[01:14:00]  I want to say hello to all my friends at Raway, my fans and friends at Raway.  I know you're watching.  I got a, it was on the message board that I have fans at Raway prison.  They watch it, they watch it Raway every day.  I'm so, hey, huh?  There it is.  Watch my segment about, I'm going to do a segment on making a shank out of Italian bread.  For all my friends, they should be, they should tune into that one.  If there's any trouble out in the yard, you could stab them with a piece of stale Italian bread, huh? 
[01:14:30]  Mamma mia.  I want to thank my good friend Scott Peterson out there, had a little trouble, a little running with the law.  I'm not a, you know, it happened to me.  I got a ticket once so I understand.  I want to thank Scott.  Thoughts and prayers with your wife and little Connor.  Thoughts and prayers.  Hope everything works out for you.  Yeah, you know, I hope everything goes well.  My friends and fan, my friend and fan, Scott Peterson. 
[01:15:00]  Merry Christmas to you, Scott.  What are you going to get, little Connor?  Another cinder block?  Get him one of those little, maybe a little fishing set.  You can take him fishing with you.  Oh, you did already.  I want to thank Robert Chambers, the preppy killer.  I want to say hi.  And, you know, thoughts and prayers out to you.  A big fan of the show. 
[01:15:30]  I want to say hello to everybody at the Cambridge Institution for the Criminally Insane.  Got a lot of fans over there.  I hear they're replacing shock therapy with the Tony Danza show.  That's a good one.  And they're complaining.  Ha, ha, ha.  Duh.  I just want to say hello to Michael Jackson.  Here he's having some problems. 
[01:16:00]  And, you know, I also want to say hi to all my good friends and fans at Nambla,  the North American Man-Boy Love Association.  You know, what's wrong with a little man-boy love?  Thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers.  To all the kid lovers.  Hey, I just want to say...  I just want to say hello to all my shit-dick fans. 
[01:16:30]  All the shit-dicks out there.  Thoughts and prayers.  Hope the tests come back negative.  I hope your T-cell counts higher than my ratings.  Hey, sarcoma.  Sounds like an Italian dish, doesn't it?  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:17:00]  Thoughts, prayers, hello, all my fans.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, God.  Why is he thanking Rawway?  I don't know.  It doesn't seem like a Tony Danza thing to do.  No.  Really?  Prisoners.  You know, that's the anti-Tony Danza thing.  That's the bad stuff you don't really want to acknowledge that's out there.  Yeah.  On a fun show like the Tony Danza show.  All right.  Oh, we'll be back.  Hey, I want to say hello and thank you to all my friends and fans, Catholic priests. 
[01:17:30]  Just want to say hi to all them.  Oh, I thanked Namblo already.  I'm sorry.  No trouble with the priest.  By the way, that's my new bit.  What bit, Opie?  When the devil just pops out of me.  I like that.  I'm talking.  We'll be back.  Oh, the devil distorts that microphone quite a bit, doesn't he?  That's devilish of you.  That's what makes the bit good.  Oh, we got a couple.  Thank you.  Oh, we have some already?  What do you got?  Are these the... 
[01:18:00]  Can we just read them right off or do we have to find them off this sheet?  Uh, well, the top one says, I've heard that Tony likes to meet a few fans before the show  to help him relax.  Anyone know?  How to be a lucky fan...  Fan...  Danza?  See, I guess the printer's still not working right, right?  It's still...  And then someone's sweet midnight writes, he meets the fans when commercials are on.  I was on his show a few weeks ago.  Yeah, so it goes, one of ours, one of theirs, one of ours. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God, it's so true.  Last month, it was my neighbor Leslie's birthday, and she got to see Tony's show.  Jealous.  I'm so jealous.  What?  She was online with her friend Debra.  Someone who works there came outside with a phone, and guess what?  Tony was on the line.  Debra got to talk to him.  Yeah, but the person that wrote that one is thoughts and prayers.  She doesn't know it's one of our assholes.  And then someone writes, did she get to go backstage? 
[01:19:00]  Get on her knees and pray with Tony?  She took a picture with him and his mule.  And he asked her to go out after the show.  And then sweet midnight writes, you guys have nothing better to do than post gross post.  Clean up the act of it, will you, please?  And then thoughts and prayers go, Miss, may I inquire as to what you find so gross in this thread?  Wow, I just noticed you have over 3,000 posts. 
[01:19:30]  You must be his biggest fans.  Do you go to the show a lot?  Is there any more?  Any more?  I don't know.  Well, Spider-Man's junk is chiming in.  Oh, man.  I wish I could have had the opportunity to pray with Tony like Debra did.  She took it, the lovely thing.  God bless her heart.  God bless her heart.  Wow, guys.  The Tony Danza.  See, the printer still is messed up. 
[01:20:00]  It's cutting off half the posts.  And that's what...  Whatever.  You don't need that on a live radio show, though, when you've got to go to...  Why would you?  Who cares if the bed flows?  Okay.  I would love some of your pasta and clam sauce.  And then hoo-hoo Howie writes, the internet is for porn.  A bunch of tools.  What does that mean, the internet is for porn?  What is that?  I don't know. 
[01:20:30]  What is that?  Why would somebody write that?  The internet is for porn.  The internet is for porn.  Shrek.  See up all night hugging me.  Porn to porn.  Porn.  Porn.  Oh.  Can we read these?  Shit dick.  It's shit dick's post.  Does anyone know if Tony is bi by any chance?  I'd really like to...  Oh, I wouldn't ever really get the chance with him, but I would love to try to meet him. 
[01:21:00]  Spider-Man junk rides.  Mr. Shit.  I don't think that the beloved Tony is bisexual.  Have you seen the way he dances?  That is pure choreography of a blank homosexual.  And then this post by Lil' Connor Peterson, followed up by a post from Old Gravy Leg.  You guys rock. 
[01:21:30]  Lil' Connor Peterson writes, I don't know, but I know I'll never get old to find out if  I'm gay or I'm gay or not.  Holy crap.  And then Old Gravy Leg writes, Mr. Danza is Connor's godfather.  To the Italian people, this is a very religious and sacred bond.  Oh, you guys are assholes.  That is so funny.  Old Gravy Leg.  Oh, they're killing this message board. 
[01:22:00]  God, is that funny.  Lil' Connor Peterson.  Did he sell it?  L-I-L.  L-I-L.  L-I-L.  Not little, it's Lil'.  They're coming in like crazy.  There seems to be lots and lots of posts.  Holy shit.  What's this one?  I don't see any.  This is an example of what they talk about when these are just the regular people. 
[01:22:30]  No, they're just talking about recipes.  They want recipes because...  They want the Thanksgiving recipes, but now that Thanksgiving's over, they can't get them.  Can you print for me recipes?  Well, we'll get more as the show goes on, Ant.  Their names are so goddamn funny.  And you know how long that message board is not going to last for a while?  They're going to ruin it for someone else.  We got to...  Now with the likes of shit dick posting.  Can we figure out how to print these up better or...  All right, figure it out because the bit doesn't flow when we've got to try to figure out what they're saying. 
[01:23:00]  Godfather.  Hey, this is the Game Triple H.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie, we got more messages off of the Tony Danza message board.  One, Angela loves Tony's mule.  Is mad at anal fissure.  Saying, please change your name.  I like this one here. 
[01:23:30]  What is Tony's real name?  Does anyone know?  And then somebody writes,  Tony Danza's real name is Antonio Salvatore La Danza.  Although there's been an argument as to whether his real first name is Antonio or Anthony.  And then Tony Rules writes,  I hear his real name is Ben Sparks.  Can anyone confirm this? 
[01:24:00]  Our own Ben Sparks.  I heard Tony is going to be playing a part in the next Sopranos season.  Anyone know what part this might be?  And Angela loves Tony's mule, right?  I hope Tony plays the part of a farmer.  Maybe then we can all see his mule.  Will you blow me?  The names are great. 
[01:24:30]  I want to know if maybe Tony can give some cleaning tips.  I have these stains on my mattress and all over my bathroom that I just can't get out.  Any suggestions?  Looking forward to hearing from you, Ben Sparks.  Oh, God.  Big dude, he's Ben.  What is that?  Is that somebody's...  Wait, wait.  You know, going back to cleaning up the mess, though, there's a few responses. 
[01:25:00]  Club soda candy always works for me, fella.  It makes me want to skip around.  It works so well.  You use club soda candy to clean it out?  And then he writes, yeah, but club soda leaves a big stain.  A big stupid stain.  Big and stupid.  Even if the club soda is indeed handsome.  And a new one that I just read.  One of my favorite names.  Saying, if anyone needs advice on how to clean the ring around the bathtub, let me know. 
[01:25:30]  I'll share my secret.  And that's from Yates Party of Five.  Oh, my God.  You people are scumbags.  Party of Five.  All right, Ant.  Bring her on the bathtub.  We have more of these racist, silly songs to play.  Sensitive people.  Five little candles blown out too soon. 
[01:26:00]  God damn.  People are brutal.  Love it.  We can't even move on because Norton's like, Norton's just laughing his ass off.  These are really funny.  Oh, they're hilarious.  You missed this one, Ant.  Oh, I did?  When you were reading the thing about, this was from Old Gravy Leg, and it said, this is  the one you wrote.  Hey, Tony, I wanted you to give me some cleaning tips.  I have the stains in the mattresses.  In the bathroom, I can't get out.  And it says, looks forward to hearing from you, Ben.  But then it says, P.S. 
[01:26:30]  I have a great recipe for beef jerky that you could use on the cooking segment.  It's called Ben's Herky Jerky.  Just pick up every little thing from the show.  God damn, are they funny.  All right.  New name on the Tony Danza message board?  Tony's Taint.  Welcome.  Welcome, Tony's Taint, to the message board.  This is from...  This is from Connor Peterson. 
[01:27:00]  Jim is obsessed.  He said, Dad showed Mom who's the boss.  He took her fishing.  Oh, my God.  Who's the boss?  He's turning red.  Look at Jim.  He's red.  Complete creeps.  The virus is now free.  I'm an ass.  Because nobody would pay for a virus. 
[01:27:30]  You better recognize this is the worst of O&A.  XM's high voltage 202.  O&A.  Opie and Anthony have approximately 127 people to make the show happen.  And that doesn't include the asswiper.  The worst of O&A.  Frenchy is a legend on the O&A virus. 
[01:28:00]  Yes, this is me, Frenchy.  And I'm not a virus.  But I am quite funny when I want to be.  How did you become part of the O&A virus?  Well, it was, what, six, seven years ago when the guys was in the WNEW.  I called up one day and I wanted to do cook some rats for a survivor show when the first  survivor show came out.  Cook some rats?  Yes.  Some guy brought some live rats and I called up to be the chef to cook them. 
[01:28:30]  Are you a legitimate chef?  Yes, I am.  I'm a French chef and a French restaurant on the upper west side.  Cordon Bleu?  Not Cordon Bleu, but it's a bistro restaurant, but I trained in France.  Yes.  You were a legend on the Opie and Anthony show.  And so far on XM, I hear, you've bombed.  How come?  Well, the reason, one of the reasons is because they're there in the morning from 6 to 10 and  I work nights.  They now have new hours, 7 to 11. 
[01:29:00]  7 to 11, yes.  That's a little bit better.  But the thing is, I work from 2 to 11 o'clock, 11.30 at night.  By the time I go home, I stay up to 2 o'clock in the morning and go to sleep.  I don't get up before 12 or 12 or 11.  Describe Opie and Anthony in French to all the XM nation.  Eh bien, le show de Opie and Anthony est super et il faut que Ã§a continue tout le temps.  You have 30 seconds to now sell Opie and Anthony to all members of the XM nation that have never 
[01:29:30]  heard them, but do it in English.  All right, guys.  So you have to get it because it's the greatest show there is on the market.  You got to get it.  It's great.  You could listen to this thing.  It's unbelievable.  You will piss your pants out.  Even if a stupid foreigner can listen to it and like it and laugh its ass out, well,  I don't know what you need.  Just listen to it.  You'll like it.  Frenchie is part of the ONA virus.  Merci beaucoup.  Bonsoir.  Merci beaucoup Ã  vous.  Et Ã  la prochaine.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony on XM202. 
[01:30:00]  I hope it.  Yeah.  I don't really want to give away too much of this.  I don't mind if the bit's played, but...  Let's just say this.  This is a fine bit, and I get to show off the impression I do.  I do a very good impression of an old TV character.  And I think you'll enjoy it in this bit. 
[01:30:30]  I'm looking forward to hearing that.  Yeah, it's a good one.  I've been doing it for a while, and I'm kind of known for doing this impression.  All right.  Ooh, someone's getting a phone call.  That's not me.  Is that your phone, Jimmy?  It very rarely will ring.  Let's see who this could be.  Why don't you answer it like you do that impression?  It's the crazy ex.  Stop it.  Hello?  Hello?  He hung up on you.  It's not a he.  I'm not a homo.  It's a she.  And that's also the most interesting thing this crazy bitch has said in three years.  Hey, baby, how you doing? 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Yeah, I remember this day.  It's the whole Lost in Space thing, Dr. Smith clips.  We've been on to Dr. Smith for a very long time.  He's a pedophile, lost in space.  So we kind of reviewed some of the old audio clips from Lost in Space.  Dr. Smith playing some of the clips from the show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  What do you guys want to do next?  Got a bunch of stuff to get to. 
[01:31:30]  We got the Lost in Space clips.  Yeah.  We've been obsessed with this for many years.  Young boys.  We actually had, what was his name?  Jonathan Harris?  Yeah.  Jonathan Harris.  We had him on our show back at N.E.W.  Remember that?  I sure do.  There's another one that over the two years that we were off, dropped dead.  Dr. Zachary Smith from Lost in Space.  For years.  God, from the time we hooked up to do radio, we've been goofing on the fact that he really 
[01:32:00]  comes off like a pedophile on Lost in Space with young William.  There you had Penny, who was the sister, and then Judy, who was like the big blonde on the  show.  Big torpedo tits she had on her.  A hot piece of ass.  Major West, though, was, I think, having sex with her.  But Dr. Smith never gave them a look. 
[01:32:30]  Young Penny and Judy, nothing.  Barely talked with the adults.  The adults would have nothing to do with him because he was just a screw-up.  He would always try to sabotage things, and he was always wrecking things.  No one ever had a conversation with Dr. Smith.  It was just him talking with the young boy, young William, constantly going out on little  outings.  You know, everybody else, they'd land on some planet, and the rest of the crew, you know, 
[01:33:00]  the father there and Don West, would go out and do whatever they had to do.  Yeah.  They would work.  Collect food for the family.  The ladies.  Work on the spaceship a little bit.  Yeah, the ladies would set up the hydroponic garden and start getting some food together  for them.  The guys would repair the ship or go out and see if they could find some kind of supplies  that they need.  And Dr. Smith, what was he doing?  Just roaming around, climbing rocks with Will, looking around.  William, come with me. 
[01:33:30]  Looking for monsters.  Looking for monsters, oh dear.  I'm hoping that the rain would come.  They did a game of monster rain under the Jupiter, too, yes.  Incidentally, that is where Jimmy Robinson's last name came from.  Right.  From Will Robinson.  From Will Robinson.  You named him Jimmy Robinson because you thought Will Robinson was pretty cool?  Cool, yeah.  Because he hung out with an old man?  I remember.  Wow.  Yes.  This whole thing is getting deeper.  I didn't know that.  Young Jimmy Norton, come with me.  Yeah.  Oh, dear. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Come with me, Jimmy Norton.  And for some reason, the family had no problem with this.  Sending Will off with Dr. Smith, who pretty much almost got the entire family killed on  a weekly basis.  But I guess all was forgiven by the end of the episode.  You play the music.  Come on, Smith.  Back in the ship, Smith. 
[01:34:30]  Instead of leaving him out there, you know, hogtied.  And invite him back in so they can land on another planet and he can romp around with  their young son again.  So we're slowly but surely going through all the clips of the show.  Yeah.  How many years was it on?  Those shows back in the 60s were only on just a couple seasons.  Yeah.  It just seems like they were on forever.  Well, not that long.  But they pumped out a lot of episodes back then, too.  So we got like 10 really quick clips here. 
[01:35:00]  The first one is just overacting.  Yeah, it's just the way he ran around like a faggot.  And it's weird, though.  If you watch the first couple of episodes of Lost in Space, the mood is a lot darker and  it's not as camp and zany.  You know, and Dr. Smith isn't this over-the-top Kansas City faggot that he turns into by the  later part of the show.  He's very evil, very dark and sinister, and he was there to sabotage the Jupiter, too. 
[01:35:30]  And then by the middle of this, not even the middle of the run, it was still like kind  of the beginning of the run, they thought for some reason to just make him this over-the-top  fag.  Flamboyant.  A queen.  And he just runs around yelling and screaming like this.  Help me, dear.  I'm Wade Steen up here.  Hurry up, Penny.  I'm stuck.  Penny.  Hurry up, dear.  Help!  What is he stuck in?  Help!  He's stuck in William's Buttocks!  It's so tight and hairless! 
[01:36:00]  Boy has a sweet face, doesn't he?  Oh, yes.  He's wearing a flaming shirt.  Young boy.  Hey, I gotta go to the phone real fast.  Say hi to Jeff in Illinois.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, man.  This is Jeff from Danville.  Hey.  Hi, Jeff.  Hey, I know you guys were talking about Zachary Smith thinking he might be a pedophile and  everything.  I don't know if you guys are aware or not, but that kid that played young William has been 
[01:36:30]  doing pornos for a long time.  Come on, really?  No.  I'm serious.  Where did you hear that, sir?  Well, I've been hearing it.  The Chicago radio station talks about it all the time.  I mean, they've been talking about it for, like, the last 10 years.  No.  All right, stay on hold.  Well, we gotta have some proof of that.  I had no idea.  They put porno movies on Internet Movie Database.  And there's no way.  Billy Mummy.  That's his name. 
[01:37:00]  Billy Mummy.  And there's no...  He never did porno.  He's been in regular movies.  Is he still acting?  I think so.  Not really.  A lot...  Last thing I saw him in, he was in, uh...  He was in the Twilight Zone movie years ago when that came out.  What'd he look like?  He was in the Anthony episode.  Looks like he did as a kid, only grown up.  Pretty odd.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  And he...  He was like a co-writer on that old, early 80s song, Fish Heads.  Remember Fish Heads?  Oh, really?  Fish Heads.  Roly-poly Fish Heads. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  He was like one of the writers or something.  Barnes and Barnes.  Barnes and Barnes.  Who did that?  Fish.  Bonds!  Fish Heads.  Roly-poly Fish Heads.  Fish Heads.  Fish Heads.  Eat them up.  Yum.  Yeah, he was one of the, uh...  Like, writers of that.  Billy Moomy.  Billy Moomy.  What has he done?  Last thing he has listed here is in 1997 as Billy Moomy.  Ugh.  He was a voice.  No, there's no, um... 
[01:38:00]  I don't see any porno.  They list...  They do list them on this?  Yeah, they list porno.  You put in porno, like, uh...  Who was your buddy there from porno that we met the other day?  Oh, I forgot which one.  You know, the one that, uh, we recognize.  Tom Byron.  Yeah, Tom Byron.  Put his name in.  Dude, the guy's got 1,200 movies.  1,200 movies.  These guys get more screen time than most Hollywood actors will ever get.  Wait, I want to hear Fish Heads real fast.  All right.  Oh.  Fish Heads, Fish Heads, Roly Poly, Fish Heads. 
[01:38:30]  Fish Heads, Fish Heads, Eat Them Up, Yum.  Fish Heads, Fish Heads, Roly Poly, Fish Heads.  Fish Heads, Fish Heads, Eat Them Up, Yum.  This would scare me.  Smoking some pot when you were watching MTV back then.  Fish Heads, Fish Heads, In the Evening, Splatting in the Soup.  Fish Heads, Fish Heads, Roly Poly, Fish Heads, Fish Heads, Eat Them Up, Yum. 
[01:39:00]  Nah, he never did porno.  Fish the fish head, anything you want to, they won't answer.  They can't talk.  They can't talk.  Nice buzz, dude.  Yeah, really.  A whole song about fish heads.  The kid from The Christmas Story that got his tongue stuck on the flagpole.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  Mm-hmm.  He went into porno.  He was also in, what was it called, The Toy? 
[01:39:30]  After that scene, how could you not?  Oh.  Oh, was that the kid that starred with Pryor and Gleeson?  Yeah.  He did porn?  Yeah.  He ended up, he's still doing it.  Yeah.  Yeah, he does porno.  I think I met him a few times at Sober Dances or something like that in Jersey,  years ago, early 90s.  His name is Eric something?  Maybe.  I got the site up.  We'll check that out.  Quickly, quickly.  Eric Bates?  No, that was his name in the movie. 
[01:40:00]  Scott Schwartz.  Okay.  Scott Schwartz.  Yeah, Scott, Scotty's X-Rated Adventure.  Dirty Bob's Excellent Adventure, 36 and 35, he was in.  Yeah, he's done porno.  Not exactly screen legends.  No, not exactly.  But yeah, he's one of the child stars that went on to web pornography.  Very proud.  Steve head, Steve head, Steve head, sweet and cozy Steve head. 
[01:40:30]  Put your arms around him and kiss him up.  Kiss him up.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Kiss him up.  It's not dirty.  It's cute.  It's what you do to a roly-poly Steve head.  Roly-poly Steve head.  A sweet and cozy boy.  All right, so back to the clips, Anthony.  Another clip of Dr. Smith overreacting.  Overacting, I should say. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yes.  Let's get rid of him.  This is our chance.  That saw your evil mind's work, wasn't it?  No!  Oh, stay away from me!  Oh, leave me alone!  Oh!  Probably had a girl chasing him.  Ew!  You with the boobies and vagina!  Ah!  It's like a monster!  Leave me alone!  What kind of creature is this?  A vagina?  Ah!  Get it away!  It smells! 
[01:41:30]  I hear they have teeth, William!  Protect me from the vagina!  Ah!  I hate boobies!  They're disgusting!  I like a nice, flat, hairless chest.  Yes, like yours, William.  With a little pee-pee!  I don't like coochies, no!  Oh, here comes one penny!  Woo!  He runs away.  Dr. Smith, a vagina is approaching. 
[01:42:00]  Help me!  Oh, no!  Spare me that disgusting opening penny!  Hide it, please!  Hide it, please!  It's disgusting!  Someone could fall in and get hurt!  Woo!  I like a young plucked chicken!  Ugly vaginas!  Look at it!  Ew!  Ew!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[01:42:30]  Oh!  Yes  Since we're lost in space  Maybe we can do some docking  Come here, William  This is docking  See, you take yours  Yes  Now  Peel back  Yes  Look, we've docked  We are one, William  You ugly girls  Nasty  Oh, dear 
[01:43:00]  I must dock with you, William  Or you'll float away for sure  It's our little secret, my boy  Our little secret, yes  Penny, get away  I can smell your vagina from here  It's disgusting  Woo  You're nice, you're young  And hairless  Let me rub you with some oil  Maybe someday you'll grow into a big bear 
[01:43:30]  With a sweet face  But for now  I love the lack of hair  Woo  Perfect  Perfect  Alright, so  Now we get into some of the gay clips  This is an ongoing project, right?  We'll have more as the show progresses, right? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, that's only season one  We're waiting for season two  Alright, season one, Anthony  So now we get into some of the gay clips  Proving that Dr. Smith was a pedophile  Like those last two are real masculine  Where has he been?  What a fruit  Let's listen to this one  Too bad about young Will, though  The only agreeable companion I found on this ghastly trip  The only agreeable companion  You agree?  Yes? 
[01:44:30]  Keep it secret from everybody?  Companion, it's a boy  Alright, here's Dr. Smith is gay  Clip one  Alright  When you're finished  There is the most incredible thing  I want to take you to see  It'll be our little secret  Let us in on your little secret too, sir  Oh, it was nothing  Nothing at all  Just a little child's game  I was going to make up  Oh, good  What are you up to? 
[01:45:00]  You have an evil, suspicious mind, Major  I just happened to be off for a stroll  You didn't see Will by any chance  You stay away from that boy, Smith  Not very concerned about his higher education, are you?  I am concerned  Every time I see him with you  Let me tell you something  If I ever catch you telling that boy wild stories again  So help me, Smith  No need to threaten brute violence, Major  I know how afraid you are of my influence  Oh, they get away with this on TV, man  Stay away from that boy, Smith  Little child's game, Dr. W 
[01:45:30]  The rain is coming  Yes, monster rain, William  Let's play  Here it comes  Quick, under the Jupiter 2  Okay, now you pull down your little Mylar futuristic pants  And I'll pull down mine  Yes  Don't tell anybody  This is very secretive, William  God damn, that is funny, man 
[01:46:00]  That really is funny  He is just awful  Well, we got a young boy  We got another example of Dr. Smith being gay  Anthony on Lost in Space  Dr. Smith and I are going to wait up for you  I don't think that's such a good idea, Will  Well, we have our sleeping bags  And Mom said it was all right  The boy is perfectly safe with me  All right, Will  Now then, let us retire to our sleeping quarters  Come along, my boy  Right, sir  Good night, Dad  And I will  Just hand them over to a predator

I like to look at some pornography in the bathroom, young boy  I have a monkey, too  Named Bubbles  Bubbles, come quickly  They just send them off  We got our sleeping bags  Yes, but we'll only need one, William 
[01:47:00]  We'll zip them together to keep warm  Dr. Smith is 112 on this planet  Yes, indeed  What a predator  The biggest danger on any planet  And they didn't see it  Will, why can't you sit?  Well, it's a  Quiet, my boy  Quiet  It's our little secret  Our little secret, isn't it?  Yes  That's great 
[01:47:30]  God damn, I didn't know there were such blatant clips  Yeah  That's fantastic  Oh, you know what?  I'm a huge Family Guy fan  Yeah, I forgot about this  We've got to get this clip  Did you ever see the Family Guy episode  Where they have Lost in Space jokes  Where the whole family stays at the ship  And the father says  William, go off in the space car  To find food with that old, menacing pedophile  Yeah  Oh dear  Please walk with me 
[01:48:00]  Remember the episode of Lost in Space  On the vegetable planet  With the carrot guy  That whenever he got thirsty  He'd say  Moisture, moisture  I need moisture  Moisture  Oh yeah  I remember the other guy  With like the pillow on his chest  And he would go  Crush, kill, destroy  Oh yeah  Crush, kill, destroy  And he picked up big rocks  And would squish them  And the episode where  Dr. Smith got all strong  And he was able to crush rocks  I think my favorite one  Was the one where they  Was it the robot got real big 
[01:48:30]  Or the family got real small  I don't remember  And they had to crawl inside the robot  And take a big journey through them  And at the end they were going to get real big  Again  So they had to get out of the robot  Before they grew  Or else they'd get squished inside there  Or something  That was a good one  Alright  Another example of Dr. Smith being gay  Yes  Hi Doctor  William  What a delightful surprise  Where have you been keeping yourself?  I've been sort of busy, sir  Well, you're here now  And that's all that matters  Come closer, come closer 
[01:49:00]  Come closer  Yes  You're here now  That's all that's important  Please grab my penis, William  Are you kidding me?  Yes  Hug away  I had to tell my father, Dr. Smith  Oh  No harm done  I would have informed him myself  Eventually  Now  What about a piece of delicious French pastry? 
[01:49:30]  Here, my boy  Dessert for tonight's dinner  Compliments of Zachary Smith  Thank you, sir  You know, Will  I've missed you  It's been very lonely here without you  How did they get away with this?  Yes  French pastry  That's my code word for my schlong  Eat up, young boy 
[01:50:00]  It's cream filled  Oh  I've missed you  You could have come to see me  I've been banished, remember?  Is that the only reason you stayed away?  I don't quite follow you, my boy  You said all you wanted to do was check out the machine  That's exactly what I've been doing  For four days?  Well, you see  Science is a matter of trial and error  I had to be sure there was no danger  Have you found any?  There are certain problems 
[01:50:30]  But as soon as they're ironed out  When will that be?  Eventually, my boy  Eventually  What you really mean is  Never, don't you, sir?  Now, Will  What a thing to say  Don said now that you had the machine  You didn't need us anymore  Surely  You don't believe that?  He said all you cared about was yourself  That's not true  I don't think I want the pastry anymore  I sort of lost my appetite for it 
[01:51:00]  Goodbye, sir  Will?  Will?  Wait a moment  Will?  Oh dear  That's a little creepy, huh?  A little touching moment between man and boy  And this is the one we've been playing all morning  You will be molested  That was a quickie  Yeah  And then this one that we've been playing, the sex grunts  Sounds like the last bit 
[01:51:30]  Apparently he's carrying a heavy bucket of rocks  And that's why he's making the grunting sounds  But if it doesn't sound like he's coming  I don't know  All right  And then, uh  Another clip  There, there, my brave boy  It's all over now  You take your hands off him 
[01:52:00]  There, there  It's all over now  You'll be able to sit in a week or two  Nothing is tight as the first time  But you're the only game in town  Poor boy  There, there  It's all over now  For this hour  Not only lost in space  But molested  And then, uh 
[01:52:30]  Finally  We'll have more  Oh yeah  Here's the last one for today  Dr. Smith  Good boy  Someday  You will all thank me for this  Yeah, thank you sir  May I have another  Very well  There you go  That's very funny  Young boy  That's really funny  That they just would  Put that on TV  Just let this family 
[01:53:00]  Send their young boy out  With this old pedophile  Oh dear  You got me again  Every time it's funny  Oh dear  I seem to have wet my pants  With club soda  William, help me  Help me, Eric  Yes, I need something  To wipe up with  Young boy  Yes, yes  More towels, please  Could I have one of those  Pleasure cleaning rags  From the convention? 
[01:53:30]  Yes  A cum clean?  I need a cum clean, William  William, wipe your mouth  Before you go back to the ship  Use a cum clean  So young and hairless  The jism flakes right off  Doesn't get stuck in hairs  Like on my legs  Alright, well  Would you like a Turkish towel?  Please get me a Turkish towel  A Turkish towel 
[01:54:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show  You're listening to the  Worst of Opie and Anthony  We got another Norton story for you  I love the Norton stories  Isn't it?  Yeah  He had a crazy ex  A crazy, crazy ex  I believe that was  Your last girlfriend, right?  My last real relationship  Yes  Aww  How long ago was that?  We probably  We were together on 9-11  So I would say  That we probably broke up  A few months after that  So I'm saying  Probably in mid or end of 2001  We broke up  So three years  And you haven't had  A real girlfriend since then?  No way, man  Wow  I've been on a few dates here and there 
[01:54:30]  I date, but  Yeah, of course  I haven't had anything  He has a girlfriend  I was going to say  He has a girlfriend  $250 a time  That's right  Yeah, TFE  Girlfriend experience  Yeah  So you teach us so much  On this show  Well, Norton has some  Great stories about his ex  So let's roll a tape  And check it out  On the Worst of Opie and Anthony  Do they even play tape anymore?  It is the year 2005  I know, roll the tape  Yeah  So you crank up the Victrola  Here comes that bit  Should be a push the button  It's all done with computers  These days, Opie 
[01:55:00]  But I'm right  Look behind Martini Steve  Those big, huge  Turntables  What?  No, the reels  The big reel-to-reel tapes  Are spinning?  Yeah, they're spinning  As we spin  Unless it's a prop  Steve is looking for them  What a tool  Wow  It's the worst  And Opie and Anthony  Joe Rogan said it best  When we were in L.A.  I think you might have been  Playing poker  He said  Probably what?  He said  I can't speak for you  Or anyone else  But I agree with him  You don't want to see  You don't want to know  Any of your exes  Are banging  Someone new 
[01:55:30]  You just don't want to know  Just don't want to know  Eh  Not right away  You know, after a while  It just doesn't matter to you  You don't care anymore  But  Yeah, right away  And you don't want to see  Him gussied up  You know  You don't want to see  Him looking better  So you just  Cut all ties  Bye-bye  I miss my  I miss my one ex  Because we're such  One ex-girlfriend  I'm really good friends  With still  Yeah, see  That I have no  But she's actually  Somebody who I  I don't mind it  And I don't get jealous  She dates guys  She doesn't care  She's actually just a friend 
[01:56:00]  You're Seinfeld in a lane  Exactly  Pretty much, yeah  Except then I realized  Wow, man  She was a great girl  On a date  She was fun  She's really smart  She has an insane sense of humor  And then she calls me  And says how she threw  An ashtray through her  Boyfriend's $7,000  Plasma screen TV  Because they had a fight  I'm like, you know what  I'm kind of glad  That we're not banging anymore  Thank God  What about the other stuff  She told you  Can we get into any of that  Yeah, I wish too bad  You can get her on the air someday  She's out of her mind  She's one of my favorite people  Which I'm nuts  I love this girl  Yeah  I know who he's talking about  Oh, she's nuts 
[01:56:30]  What else did she do  She like  She cashed one of his checks  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  She cut herself a check  For $20,000  Out of one of his accounts  $20,000  Yeah, but  And there were hookers involved  In the relationship  They used to like  Absolutely  Get hookers together  But she actually did  She actually felt bad  And stopped the check  Like she didn't try  To actually do it  Before it went through  She called and canceled it  Like she's like  What am I doing  I can't do this  We were sitting at Starbucks  And she was telling us  These stories  And I was out of my  What else 
[01:57:00]  Did she stab the guy  Or something  Oh, no, she cut his leg  Or something  I think she threw glass  At him or something  Jesus Christ  And there were times  That I looked at this girl's eyes  And said, I love you  Oh, man  And I never had that  Well, good thing it worked out  That way  For the new audience  You've got to explain  Your first date with her  Because that's a classic story  It's actually kind of sweet  Sweet  We met on the Opie and Anthony show  People know  It doesn't matter  She kind of  I was driving my car  And Opie and Anthony  Had a girl in the studio  That kind of liked being slapped  During sex  Oh, okay  Remember you guys called out 
[01:57:30]  On the air and said  Jim, if you're listening  Call in  This was before  I was like a daily regular  And I called in  And went into the studio  And met her  And she was hot  And I slapped her  A few times on the air  And we all laughed  Uh-huh  And then she and I went  And I said  Come on  You're coming to the  Comedy Cellar tonight  Oh  So this is a first date  Sure  Kind of like a first date  So we go down  To the Comedy Cellar  And we're upstairs  In the olive tree  And she's like  Can I borrow 20 bucks  All right  I'm like  I wonder what she needs that for  But I used to partake  In certain activities  And I'm like  I think I know  What she needs that for  And I probably won't be  Seeing her again 
[01:58:00]  For the rest of the evening  But I'm a good sport  So I said  Here's 20  And she comes back  About an hour later  And I'm like  I couldn't believe  She even came back  I'm like  What happened  And she's like  Well I tried to buy coke  In Washington Square Park  But the guy held a knife  To my throat  And took the money  So  I think she had a water  And a chicken kebab  And then I dropped her off  And we had oral sex  In the car  And I dated her  For nine months after that  She tried to buy coke  You know how it is  On a first date  Yeah  Go out to score coke  From a negro  In Washington Square Park  And he holds a knife  To your throat 
[01:58:30]  And takes the money  Then you come back  I love that  Come back  You silly goose  Isn't that a great first date  Wow  Wow  Yeah  What a lunatic  Oh she's nuts  And then Jimmy  But she's funny  She's like really  A funny person  Dude she's great  She's a lot of fun  She really is a lot of fun  But then you realize  She had a problem  Yeah  Five minutes after  She walked back  And said I tried to buy coke  Well no no  Well when she was getting up  In the middle of the night  And going to the bathroom  With her pocketbook  Oh yeah  We had to go to a wedding  We had to go to a wedding  One morning  One day  And at three in the morning  She's running  This is where I lived in Jersey 
[01:59:00]  She's running into my bathroom  With her purse  I'm like do you understand  That I'm in recovery  You think I don't know  What you're doing in there  What are you doing  She's like no  I'm just going to the bathroom  I'm like no you're not  You're like a chatty Kathy doll  It's 3.30am  You're grinding your teeth  And you're running into the toilet  With your purse  This is not Port Authority  We're sleeping  You can leave the pocketbook  Wow man  Then she hooked up  With this other guy  And it just got nuts  Yeah  We broke up a long time ago  We hated each other  This guy sounds like  A complete psychopath  That has a lot of money  Or something  Yeah I don't know why 
[01:59:30]  She and I never had  That kind of problem  With money  It was just like  You know  Just personality conflict  We just fought  But it was never like that  Like never any of that  Violent crap  I've never been involved  I've never been involved  In that shit  Now  But one time  This is why I knew  I kind of loved her  I was going down on her  One time  And she was getting  Really turned on  And she said  Do you think little girls  Get wet when their fathers  Go down on them  And she came  Wow she said that  Yeah she said  Yeah  Holy shit  And she meant it  What a nut  Yeah and she meant it  Wow  And she meant it  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah she's twisted 
[02:00:00]  What is wrong  But she's just one of those people  That's like  I love having her as a friend  It's like  You know  I mean dated  It got crazy  And believe me  I wasn't easy either  And she  Still  It's like hanging with her  And she makes me laugh  Nice  Yeah  She loves pedophile humor  Gotta respect that  The worst of all in a  I don't care  If you throw your XM down the toilet  Complete with XM interloculums  And they ain't body parts  XM's high voltage to 
[02:00:30]  Opie  And Anthony  Yes Hpie and Anthony  We're very, very proud  To have them part of the XM family  And that's all that's coming out  For right now  Anthony, he smells better, even on the radio.  Opie.  XM Satellite Radio, celebrating the first free week of Opie and Anthony.  Unlocked and free for the masses now.  XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly with another Opie and Anthony interlocular explanation. 
[02:01:00]  You get fired again, this time from XM. Why?  Human sacrifice, probably.  Yeah, I don't even think it's going to be something sensational.  I think it'll be something stupid, like we mouthed off to one too many higher up at XM,  and they said, f*** this, goodbye.  It won't be a blaze of glory like the last one.  It'll be some misstep with a microphone on.  Yeah, yeah, one of those things.  Some of you walking to the bathroom talking s*** and someone's in the stall. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, dropping a log.  Something like that.  Oh, right.  You know, you're kneeling in front of the glory hole.  You don't know who's on the other side, and it's the boss.  Yeah.  You know, something like that.  One too many Eric Logan has a Down syndrome haircut jokes.  They say there's nothing we can do to get fired, so.  What wouldn't you do on the air?  We're up for the challenge, you know.  What wouldn't we do on the air?  What wouldn't you do on the air?  I wouldn't have a couple have sex at St. Pat's Cathedral. 
[02:02:00]  That's a good place to start.  Why not?  Because we did it.  Because nobody pays attention.  Yeah.  We did it.  No one even noticed.  People tend to get a little angry.  You have sex in their places of worship.  What I wouldn't do on the air, I wouldn't gratuitously plug gigs at the sacrifice of an entertaining radio show.  Very good.  Not the show, not me.  I wouldn't eat on the air.  I think that's very rude.  Absolutely.  I wouldn't talk about disgusting sexual things.  No.  Turn me into a toilet.  A lot of people thought that since you're on satellite radio, you can say anything, any word that pops out of your mouth. 
[02:02:30]  Yet, you're not doing it.  You create your own line.  You have no line anymore to cross.  And most people thought you were going to come on the air just that it was going to be an F-bomb-a-thon.  Well, we started by cursing a lot, and then we got that out of our system because, quite frankly, it was kind of cool to be able to curse on the radio.  And then it kind of got boring, so now we curse when it comes up in regular conversation.  I think we curse now more than we have in the past.  We're kind of pushing the curse thing back up a little bit.  Yeah.  I think because there was so much scrambling going on with some of the broadcast stations, broadcast radio, that wanted to maybe put us on. 
[02:03:00]  So we actually started thinking, well, perhaps we ought to just, you know, cut back a little bit on the cursing.  But now we're just like, f**k it.  Who cares?  Yeah, the listeners are the worst.  They call up all the time, F this, F that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They're the ones who really have more fun with it.  Yeah, and sometimes, you know, it's a lot more fun to speak in code with our little Opie and Anthony language than just blatantly saying, f**k, you know. 
[02:03:30]  We try to keep it to a minimum.  I like the freedom, though.  Like the other day on the air, it's nice to know that we're on a commercial.  This guy said something.  I'm like, ah, you're a turd.  And it was just nice to have the freedom to let that fly.  Wow.  You really told him.  Yeah, I mean, I don't mean to get really blue here, but.  I called someone a fart knocker.  Hey, fart knocker.  Wash my own mouth out with soap on that one.  What is a fart knocker?  I don't know.  Dirty word.  Nice work, Logan. 
[02:04:00]  Satellite Radio.  Now, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You know, I love these discussions when Ant and I go down the road of our early conquests.  Ah, what studs.  I don't think we told the story of how I lost my virginity yet on XM Satellite Radio.  No?  Commercial radio has heard it a few times.  Remember the time I had sex with that girl and she.  Was it the Wookiee?  Yeah, the Wookiee.  She had this very unusual birth defect. 
[02:04:30]  Ropey.  Ropey.  Ropey.  She had what could only be described as a mane.  A mane.  Yes.  Dark hair.  Bristly.  Bristly like, like bristles of a brush?  Not that bristly, but close.  Bristly like a mohawk haircut on somebody?  A little more coarse than that.  A little more coarse than that?  Yeah, a little more coarse.  And the hair was about between a quarter of an inch to a half an inch wide. 
[02:05:00]  That's pretty long for a back hair.  Not, no, not the actual hair.  I'm talking about the strip.  Oh, the strip.  Was that wide?  Yeah, between a quarter inch to a half inch.  Went from pretty much the top of her neck.  Yeah.  Well, just where the shirt would cover.  Sure.  On your back.  So you don't see it in the back.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe it went all the way up because she did have long hair.  Anyway, this mane that I'm describing went from the top of her, the back of her neck,  all the way down to her tailbone.  No way. 
[02:05:30]  All the way down the spine.  All the way down.  And I only discovered that when I, you know.  Got naked with her and had some sex.  Well, I didn't discover it when she was on her back is what I'm saying.  Oh, that was when you lost your virginity and you went to roll her over?  Yeah.  What a guy.  Wait, your first time, you're trying for the ass?  Not the ass, just the, I went for doggy style.  Oh, okay.  No, I didn't go for ass.  That's a bold move on your first time. 
[02:06:00]  That whole area just frightened me.  I wasn't going there.  Especially if there's an arrow of hair pointing at it.  You'd take a peek while you're back there at it to see what it was all about,  but you didn't actually go for it.  What made you go for doggy style first time out of the box, into the box?  Because I lost my virginity at 18.  Yeah.  So you knew about it and you figured, but, you know, you figure you'd be so nervous.  It's your first time.  You just stick to the missionary.  You know, not try to get too bold. 
[02:06:30]  If you don't go for the big difficult moves, you have less of a chance of making mistakes  and looking like an ass.  There was alcohol involved.  Oh, there was?  Lots and lots of alcohol.  Usually is the first time.  It was, you know, Geneseo State.  Did the strip of hair, was it thicker as far as the width goes?  Was it wider at the top than it was by her tailbone?  Did it get narrower?  I honestly don't remember.  I do remember that it went from, yeah, from her neck all the way down to her tailbone, though. 
[02:07:00]  So, without any spots missing.  No.  No.  Maybe when we get back from vacation, we're going to be live, what, April 11th?  April 11th.  April 11th, we're back from vacation.  Maybe.  We could tease stuff now, too.  Oh.  And now we'll have show prep when we get back, which is a good thing.  Sure.  Maybe there's a doctor or someone out there that could explain exactly what this is.  What that is.  Was she hairy anywhere else, like a hairy arms, or did you have a big...  No, she was beautiful.  ...batch going in front?  She was absolutely beautiful.  Yeah, sunning except for her mane.  Except for this minor detail.  Minor. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Anyway, Anthony and his brother talk about their first sexual conquest.  Yeah.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to you.  We've got to go right to the phones.  Talking about the first time you jacked it, I guess.  Yeah, we were kind of talking about that, weren't we?  I don't know how we got...  Oh, we got on that subject because of the guy listening to the Sacramento couple yesterday.  Right, right.  Okay, gotcha.  Let's say hi to Fred.  Hey, Fred, where are you calling from, man? 
[02:08:00]  I'm calling from Augusta, Georgia right now.  Okay.  You got a story for us?  Yes, sir.  I can remember...  I'm 50 years old, so give you that to a bit.  I remember the days when we were with my mom.  We had our Simpson Sears catalog, and that's where you're jerking off to.  So I remember the first time I met...  All right, slow down, slow down, slow down.  What?  Okay.  A what catalog?  A Simpson Sears catalog.  I'm from Canada, so it's a Sears catalog.  A Sears catalog.  Oh, okay.  That you would jack it to.  Yeah, I used to jack it to the pictures of the girls in bras.  In the bras?  Yeah, that was porno back then when you were like, I don't know, tan. 
[02:08:30]  Kind of was.  You'd have to look through the circulars and find...  Oh, yeah.  You'd get that...  Or the before and after.  Bikini ads.  The before and after pictures in the back of some of those teen magazines...  Really?  ...that my older sister had, where you put this cream on your...  To the jacket to the fat chicks on the before?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's even better, actually.  I mean, that would be a funny story, too.  But they used to have in the back of these magazines a breast cream.  Oh, right.  Remember the breast cream?  Yes.  Where supposedly the teenage girls were supposed to put this cream on their boobs... 
[02:09:00]  And their boobs would get bigger.  And they'd show the before and after picture, and then you would...  Ridiculous.  You would buy this product as a teenage girl, not knowing that it's actually puberty that's  making them bigger and not their stupid cream.  All right.  So, the Sears catalog, you used the jacket to that?  Yeah.  That gives you that type of idea.  I remember when I was 12 years old, I was in grade 8.  And I wanted to get laid so bad because I was jerking off and I didn't want to know  how I felt like.  So, I finally found this girl in grade 8 who wanted to do it with me. 
[02:09:30]  So, she was like a wooden floor.  So, that was great.  Of course she had a wooden floor.  Nothing was happening down there yet.  That's right.  So, I thought all I had to do was stick it between her legs and I'd be having sex with  her.  So, we got on the floor in her bedroom and then I stuck it between her legs.  I remember it was too dry.  And all I had to stick it between her legs, I told her to squeeze her legs tighter so 
[02:10:00]  I could get it in there.  And it wouldn't go in, so I had to go down and spit in there, right?  Oh, my God.  Only in Georgia.  Jesus.  No surprise here.  Wait.  Were you having sex with her or were you having sex with her legs?  No, I was having sex with her.  Okay.  The point was, I didn't know what I was doing.  I thought I just had to stick it between her legs but not in her hole.  You see?  Yeah.  So, all I did was I spit in the hole and it got nice and greasy then.  Then I got in there and I fucked her.  All right.  Jesus. 
[02:10:30]  Then our parents came home.  Then I found out years later that it wasn't sex at all.  I had to screw it between her legs.  I didn't put it in the hole at all.  All right.  Thank you, Fred.  You scare me.  That is a frightening man.  All right.  There goes Fred.  You are frightening.  We can salvage that call, though.  There are things when you're a kid that you think is sex.  Misconceptions about sex that you do have.  So, to that guy, I think he wasn't sure you were supposed to, as he said, put it in the... 
[02:11:00]  You know, I'm not even going to say it.  I mean, come on.  Let's keep it a little clean on this show.  It sounded so nice and innocent the way he told the story, didn't it?  Ah, fuck her.  I think what he was trying to say back then, he thought having sex was just when you...  Oh, no.  He didn't know, but he ended up having sex with her legs.  Opie, I have no idea what that guy was talking about.  I'm really trying to save that phone call.  Somehow, he had sex with the girl's legs and didn't actually do it, but he thought he was  doing it.  But I don't know if he knew what actually doing it was. 
[02:11:30]  He wasn't very clear.  He was laughing too hard at his memories.  Right.  Well, I talked about this in the past.  I thought, yeah, I thought you had to do it in the back door and that the other one,  the front one was just used for what, you know.  And when did you figure it out the real way?  Last week?  Pretty much, yeah.  All the girlfriends were like, ow!  No, it was after the film, obviously.  Like, oh, oh, that's used for two things. 
[02:12:00]  Well, you're not too clear on the female parts because you don't have them.  Right.  So you're not sure.  Right.  You have the back, so you kind of know what that's about.  So you assume.  You know what?  I think we're going to just do a sex show today, I decided.  Is it completely a sex show?  Because you guys try to tell us what you want to hear on this program.  Now we're going to just do sex all day long.  Sexual discussion, and then we have sex on the couch.  Didn't you have something similar?  What you thought was sex when you were a lot younger? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, I thought it was backdoor.  When I was a kid.  I guess I was about maybe seven, and I thought it was backdoor.  And then when I learned that it was frontdoor.  All right, so you thought it was backdoor as well.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, I'm not alone.  You're not sure of the anatomy.  So, you know, you don't even know that there's anything different up there in a girl.  Well, when you're really young and you see the front one, it's intimidating and quite scary.  Very intimidating indeed. 
[02:13:00]  And when you and I were growing up, you know, women weren't really taking care of that area.  No, no.  It was a big, jungly mess.  So you couldn't even imagine.  You couldn't even imagine that was the way to go.  Yeah.  You know?  You just couldn't imagine.  Oh, no.  It was very frightening.  It was very frightening.  Frightening.  I was brought into it.  Mom, turn the radio off, okay?  Don't listen.  Yeah, because we need Anthony to not have to worry about his mom listening.  It's embarrassing, talking about, you know, stories. 
[02:13:30]  My mom, it's hilarious.  I was listening today.  I had to turn you guys off.  I'm like, do it.  Oh, that's what mine says, too.  That's fine.  She called last night.  She's like, yeah, I listen, you know, but there are times I just have to turn it off.  It's like, oh, boy, you know, whatever, 65-year-old woman is really the demo we're looking for.  So, no, turn it off.  That's what, you know, of course you're not going to like some of the stuff we're doing,  especially when you consider it's me telling the stories.  What didn't she like yesterday?  The poker chips?  No, she actually didn't listen yesterday, but there have been things. 
[02:14:00]  Whenever we talk about things like this, she doesn't like to listen, which is good.  You know, don't listen.  When I was a kid and kind of got hooked up through my father in California,  my father kind of hooked me up with this girl.  He hooked you up with a lot of girls.  On my, I guess it was my 13th birthday or something like that.  Yeah.  Is this the Buzz story?  Yeah, Buzz.  Old Buzz.  She was a friend of the family.  She was 19 years old. 
[02:14:30]  I guess she had banged everybody that we even knew.  Everybody in the town?  Yeah.  She was like the town whore.  Was she really?  The town whore.  You never said that before.  Yeah, she banged everybody.  Was she just the local chick in the bar?  She was banging all my father's horse friends, you know, that would go riding with him and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, your dad was a cowboy after he left Long Island.  He was a cowboy.  He moved out to Southern California.  I'm going to California and I'm going to be a cowboy, baby.  Bought a bunch of horses.  I went out there, lived out there with him.  He bought me a horse. 
[02:15:00]  I have a horse.  The whole deal, Opie.  I was a Western guy.  I wore cowboy boots and the cowboy hat.  I was a cowboy.  It was pretty funny.  Had a six gun.  Sure.  A real one?  A real one.  Bought it for me for, also, I guess, my 12th birthday.  Got me that.  Got me a rifle.  How long did you live out there?  I thought you were just visiting.  14, 15, maybe three or four years.  Oh, you did three or four years out there.  Yeah, three or four years.  I thought you just used to visit. 
[02:15:30]  My formative years.  Because I know your mom threw you and your brother on the bus one day.  No, that was actually coming home.  I moved out there because I wanted to move out there.  I wanted to hang out with my father and ride horses.  It's a kid's dream to be a cowboy.  My brother got thrown out there by my mother because she didn't want to deal with his pot smoking.  My brother's pot smoking, stealing and lying.  Stealing my mommy's quarters out of the quarter jar to buy joints and lying about it.  So mommy threw him out. 
[02:16:00]  So he went first?  No, I went first.  Oh, okay.  And then he joined you?  And then he joined me out there.  Gotcha.  He wasn't really into the whole cowboy thing, so he just smoked pot out there.  I was pretty much doing the same thing, only out there.  But you got into the cowboy lifestyle.  Oh, I was totally into it.  I used to listen to the, like,  like stuff you'd hear on Hank's Place.  I love Hank's Place.  I would listen to that.  That was my music.  If you guys haven't checked out Hank's Place yet on XF Salloy Radio,  I forgot what channel it is, but it's definitely worth checking out.  It's like either 10, 11, 12, or 13. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, hysterical.  It's way up there, but yeah.  Hank's Place rocks.  It's scary that people think like this in the country.  Oh, it's amazing.  In the country.  It's Red State Station.  Exactly.  Anyway, go ahead.  I was one of them.  I love that music.  So, yeah, I was a cowboy.  And she was like the town whore, Buzz.  And one night, my father and his girlfriend at the time were going out  and just kind of left Buzz there and kind of were smiling,  like winking or something when they left. 
[02:17:00]  I didn't know what was happening.  And you were 13, 12?  Yeah, I guess I was 13.  Yeah.  Was this for your birthday?  Yeah.  It was my birthday present.  And then Buzz goes, why don't you go upstairs and take a shower?  I'm like, oh, okay.  Not thinking anything about it.  Well, I was riding my horse today.  I'm a little sweaty.  I had cowboy dirt on me.  Okay.  I had cowboy dirt on me.  So, I did and I get out of the shower and I'm ready to walk back downstairs and watch TV with Buzz. 
[02:17:30]  And I hear from the bedroom, aren't you coming in?  Like, and, no, it didn't even hit me at that point.  Yeah.  I'm just thinking, hmm, now what's the voice coming from in the bedroom?  She was downstairs.  Now, why would she be, oh, it finally hit you?  Oh, oh, oh.  You're like, this is it.  Oh, this is it.  Here it comes.  I'm going to put all that jack into good use.  Yeah, that's what I heard. 
[02:18:00]  Did he get an immediate boner?  Oh, yeah.  What are you kidding?  You get that whoosh feeling all over.  Well, that's the blood just rushing.  Here it comes.  Here comes that sex stuff.  And then I kind of peer around the corner and I look in the bed and this vision is just etched in my head.  It's Buzz.  Is it still a really hot vision for you?  It's one of those nice little memories you have as a kid.  I remember seeing Buzz sitting in my bed. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  But she's sitting up with her head and torso against the headboard.  Was she hot?  Be honest.  No, she was hot.  I've heard the story a couple times.  You know what it was?  She wasn't fat at all, but she was a big girl, like tall and not skinny, but not fat.  And she had huge cans.  How much bigger was she than you?  So, it must have looked ridiculous.  Oh, okay. 
[02:19:00]  Let's just put it that way.  I've never heard this part of the story because you're 12, 13.  I was 13.  13.  Yeah.  You couldn't have weighed more than what?  110?  120 pounds?  I don't know.  I was a little more than that.  But, you know, it just must have looked ridiculous.  All right.  And she was sitting up in the bed with the blanket, like, in her lap.  It just came up to her lap.  So, her huge cans were sitting there, all milky white.  They were huge?  Oh, they were huge.  They were huge.  With nice blue veins. 
[02:19:30]  No.  They were just huge.  When you see the blood just pumping.  Boom, boom, translucent.  Pumping to the nipple.  Boom, boom.  Boom, boom.  She was sitting there.  Milky white.  And I looked in, and it was pretty much the first time I ever saw them real live.  You know, I've seen a lot of porno.  Yeah.  I had seen a lot of porno at that point.  And they sat up nice?  Yeah, because she was 19, you know.  Oh, okay, okay.  She was 19.  She was the older woman to me.  I know.  When you tell the story, I keep thinking, like, she was a 30-year-old woman. 
[02:20:00]  No, no, no.  She was 19, and you were 13.  19.  All right, yeah.  And, yeah, she goes, well, why don't you come in?  I'm like, all right.  You know, I went in, and the rest is my history.  You know, it just happened.  Oh, you want to stop the story right there?  Well, I knew what to do, so there's no real detail.  How long did you last?  It wasn't that long.  How long?  Be honest.  I don't know.  A couple pumps?  Honestly, I would tell you, I really don't remember, but I remember kind of getting into  it.  The first time you do it, it's, come on. 
[02:20:30]  You know what, though?  You were drunk?  I had jacked it in the shower that I had just taken.  I had.  I had jacked it in the shower.  You were a jacking machine, man.  A monkey!  I was like a monkey.  I swear to you.  A monkey.  So, did you just do regular sex?  Yeah, but the point is, and how this got brought up with the intimidation factor of the vag when  you first see it.  It's quite scary.  It's quite scary to see it.  And, dude, this was...  And there's a lot of parts down there, and you're like, wow, what does all that do? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, my God.  I'm going to need a chart.  Right.  Give me a map.  You know, we had continued to have sex for months afterwards.  You know?  Like, I was going to...  She would show up at the house after my father and his girlfriend would leave in the mornings  before school.  So, I'm getting ready to go to school, and she would pop into my bed.  And we'd have sex, and off I'd go to school.  Now, what's messed up?  If it was a 19-year-old guy and a 13-year-old girl... 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, I did get in trouble for that.  What?  Kidding.  Oh, okay.  You know, people wouldn't think that's cool.  Like, a guy hearing that, you know, hearing you tell the story that you're 13 banging  a 19-year-old, that is a really cool story.  Uh-huh.  Every guy dreamt that that could happen to them when they were growing up.  I told people at school, and they didn't believe me.  They thought I was just another one of their friends lying to them.  They're like, get out of here.  I'm like, no, really?  I just had sex.  Were you the first one to have sex?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:22:00]  And your group of friends?  Oh, yeah.  Must have.  That's, like, really young.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  But the, uh, now, one of these sexual encounters before school, uh, you know, she goes down  on me, and it was just, you know, wee-hoo, boy, this is goody-goody, more fun than toys.  And, uh, and then she goes, would you like to do this to me?  Oh, no.  And, and, dude, I am talking.  She wasn't that old. 
[02:22:30]  Crank this up, baby.  Oh, she wasn't that old.  Nineteen.  Still a teen in the name.  Still a teen.  Not a nasty Mrs. Robinson.  Yeah, like I'm, I'm banging Dean Warmer's wife.  With those pointy tits in her bra.  This music's playing in your head.  No.  As she pulls down her huge panties.  Yeah, I pulled down her huge, she did have big 70s panties. 
[02:23:00]  Like, you know the ones that just are not cut at all of the, uh, the legs?  Yeah.  Just big bloomers.  Those were the ones.  Let me step out of my bloomers.  Yeah.  And it had to be a mess, because this was like the 70s, right?  Kick the, uh, yeah.  Late 70s, maybe?  Kicks the bloomers over the lamp and the whole room goes dark.  Her big bloomers.  So she goes, would you like to do this to me?  Would you like to do this to me?  And the only vision I had was the vision I saw of it before I, you know, put it in. 
[02:23:30]  So, uh, I remembered what it looked like very vividly.  What it looked like?  Come on.  Dude, it was, it was as if you had punched Fidel Castro in the mouth and his lips swelled up.  And knocked out all his teeth.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  It looked like Albert Einstein with a head wound.  It was awful.  Big.  And there was a couple shots of Novocaine in the lips. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like he was going for dentistry.  And, and the hair was spread out so far, like, past the area.  She had, like, leg hair on that.  It was giant.  Thank God you just don't see that these days.  You just don't.  You know?  You don't, thank God.  Because it used to grow, I don't know, man.  Maybe we were brought up as cavemen in the, in some other era.  Because it used to grow, like, halfway down the thigh.  Down the thigh?  Man.  It doesn't even grow like that anymore? 
[02:24:30]  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Girls are less hairy, more gooder now.  But know what the problem is?  All these styles come back.  That style will come back.  You think?  Before our time is done on this earth.  I don't think so.  We are going to have to deal with that again.  I'm telling you.  I don't think so.  I'm telling you.  That's like the Hitler mustache.  Not down there, but the Hitler mustache on your face.  I never see that coming back again.  I'm telling you, man.  It's going to come back.  All right, so.  She sat on the edge of the bed one time, naked.  And when she was sitting and her lap, you know, her leg, she was bent at the waist because 
[02:25:00]  she's sitting.  It looked like she was wearing black furry panties.  Ugh.  Her pubes were just so stretched out.  I can't imagine girls were getting a lot of oral back then.  Yeah, I know.  I can't imagine.  Because now today, you know, most of the girls are completely shaved.  But just think of the hairy mess when they did.  Big Burt Reynolds mustache and pork chop sideburns going down on a chick with a rug in her lap.  Just a big hairy mess all around.  Oh, cavemen. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, that went on for years.  So did you do it?  Until I left back to...  No.  I went...  How did you get out of it?  She goes, would you mind doing this to me?  And I just went, I don't think so.  I did.  I said, I don't think so.  She knew I was a rookie.  So then what happened?  I'm not ready for the big league.  So what happened then?  We just continued having regular sex.  Yeah.  You know, she didn't cut me off from it. 
[02:26:00]  That's great, man.  I guess she understood.  You're going to eighth grade getting banged every morning.  That's amazing.  It was odd.  You know, it was pretty odd.  It was amazing, man.  And then girls my own age, I was like, you know, geez, this chick don't know shit.  She doesn't even have...  Can you help a brother out?  She doesn't even have boobs yet.  I'm like, hey, would you mind doing this to me?  And they go, I don't think so.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  Wow, that's funny, man.  Yeah.  Oh, Hank's Place is Channel 13.  Good.  Channel 13. 
[02:26:30]  Let me see if Ozzy could...  That's a great story, by the way, Anthony.  More details.  It was greater to live, Opie.  More details.  And then the next day, I got in the truck with my dad.  He was driving me to school.  And he kind of just looks over and goes, so, how was last night?  That's a cool dad, man.  For my 13th birthday, I got a 10-speed bike.  Wouldn't it be fun to know what you know now?  You got a hooker.  You basically got a hooker.  Well, it wasn't money. 
[02:27:00]  Did your dad bet there, too?  Probably.  Who knows?  Probably compare notes.  Yeah, dad.  Nice snatch.  It was...  Yeah, now it kind of...  Sorry, that threw me.  Yes.  How was last night?  Oh, if you knew what you know now, like what I could have come back with, it's like, so,  how was last night?  And go, oh, dad, I don't like girls, you know.  You know, thanks for the effort and stuff, but I really don't like girls.  Man, that's...  Freak them out.  Yeah, that's unbelievable. 
[02:27:30]  I was like, wow, no, it was, you know, it was cool.  It was good.  The replacement for nose picking.  Opium Anthony.  Now free on the satellite.  Behave accordingly.  I'm gonna break that kid's leg.  O and A.  Somebody let him out of the cage!  If I was to take a drug that would get me through four hours of the Opium Anthony virus,  it would have to be a morphine drip,  a bong loaded with leapfro-milch and ice cubes, 
[02:28:00]  a dilaudid suppository,  and all the pixie sticks I could snort,  and a nicotine patch,  and Preparation H,  just for good measure.  Opium Anthony are finally free on XM202 High Voltage.  Yeah, okay.  Nathaniel is one of the O and A interns.  Nathaniel, what is your role on the show?  I basically do everything nobody else wants to do. 
[02:28:30]  Phone screening,  getting audio from the show.  At the end of the show,  I cut up clips so that Steve can use them in production,  and, you know,  the occasional coffee and food run.  What's O and A's favorite food?  Well,  Opie likes to bring his own oatmeal.  This is real behind-the-scenes stuff.  This is good.  And Anthony just loves a plain bagel.  Shocking.  Yeah.  You heard it here first.  Give us some other dirt,  real dirt on behind-the-scenes.  Well...  Put it this way.  Who can be the biggest asshole when they're mad?  Because we all can be assholes when we're mad. 
[02:29:00]  Who can be the biggest asshole when they're mad?  Opie was cool.  Within four weeks of me working there,  he started nodding his head towards me,  acknowledging my existence.  And now I sort of get a rough grunt saying,  you know,  good job.  Thanks for coming in.  How did you become part of the O and A virus?  I had worked a little with Anthony's brother,  Joe,  out on Long Island,  and some Long Island radio.  And he just sort of put in a good word for me,  I guess.  Yeah.  There are a lot of members of the XM Nation  who have never heard Opie and Anthony  sell O and A to those members of the XM Nation. 
[02:29:30]  They like to describe it as the O and A hang sometimes.  Sometimes it's like pretty much hearing  some of the funniest people you'll ever meet hang out  and make some of the funniest jokes you'll ever hear.  Weirdest thing that O and A have asked you to do for the show?  Well,  I just helped a man who had just urinated his own pants  fill out some paperwork.  So that was a first for me.  Where in the O and A building do they hide all their porno?  We can't say.  Let's just say,  Little Jimmy's desk is always a good hiding spot. 
[02:30:00]  O and A in 30 seconds.  Go.  O and A party rock,  if I might quote Master Poe.  Funny,  good insights,  unlike me right now.  The edgiest stuff you'll hear.  And original stuff every single day.  Ah, great!  Now back to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Bye, boys!  This is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing Season 1 and Season 3. 
[02:30:30]  I was the guy who didn't win.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Your brother wants in on the conversation.  Oh, yeah?  About you and Buzz when you were a kid, Anthony.  Oh, let's see.  Out there in California.  Let's see what Joe's going to add.  Brother Joe, Anthony's brother, of course.  Joey!  Joe!  Joe!  Hey, what's up, man?  You're on the air.  Yeah.  What the hell happened?  What the hell's wrong with you?  Nothing, man.  I was just getting gas. 
[02:31:00]  I'm on my way back from Atlantic City.  Oh, you're getting gas?  Okay.  Yeah, I'm coming back from Atlantic City.  I just saw Tom Jones.  Oh, how was that?  It was cool, man.  Did he do dry vagina?  A bunch of goddamn old...  Nah, a bunch of old ladies, though.  It was hysterical, man.  They're like throwing these big old bloomers up at us.  Do they still throw their underwear at that guy?  No, it's hysterical, man.  Oh, I love Joe.  Joe, you have a great life now, man.  You don't have to get up early to do those.  Oh, Joe just cruises around the world. 
[02:31:30]  He's just doing his band thing and going to see Tom Jones concerts.  See Tom Jones, because he can now.  How does Tom Jones sound, Joe?  Things are good.  You guys have made it that way for me.  Thank you very much.  What's Tom Jones sound like?  Any good?  Dry dry...  Was that a Tom Jones song originally?  Yeah.  The guy sounded incredible.  Yeah, he was really good, man.  Still has his pipes.  Great show.  He hasn't lost a thing.  Wow, very cool.  I've got to go check him out.  It's pretty fun.  Anyway, I'm calling to talk about Buzz for a second.  Yes.  Anthony tends to whitewash things just a little bit. 
[02:32:00]  What did I whitewash?  Oh, my God.  She didn't sound like a beauty.  Nothing about...  No, no, no.  Everything is good as far as your detail goes, except for one thing.  Buzz looked like a Cro-Magnon.  She had...  All right.  ...a distended brow.  She had a unibrow.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's a detail that you forgot to tell us, Anthony.  I wasn't looking at her face.  I was horrified at the vag.  What was hairier?  Her vag or her head?  It looked the same.  Her face, I would say. 
[02:32:30]  She had a univag and a unibrow.  Wow.  You were talking about the...  Yeah, the hair thing.  I mean, that was directly due to the fact that she was like a Neanderthal.  Hey, at least I wasn't 15 banging that 30-year-old mother with a friggin' axe crotch.  Wait a second, dude.  She was 32.  Wait, are we going to get a new story today?  Oh, there was one time I was with Buzz in one of these bedrooms in this house.  Joe's the older brother.  Go ahead.  And Joe was slamming this 32-year-old mom. 
[02:33:00]  While you were banging Buzz?  Yeah, in the same room.  And Joe goes, hey, at midnight, let's switch.  And I said, I go, there is no way I'm banging that old broad.  All right, hold on.  And she walked like she'd been riding a horse for about 18 years.  That girl, what was her name?  Do you remember?  Sue.  Sue.  This girl, Sue, woman, Sue, her legs were so spread apart, and she had the gap, like where  her vag was supposed to be, was a gap like a hatchet wound. 
[02:33:30]  Was that from riding horses?  I don't know what it was from.  Maybe getting slammed by everything that walked.  But, dude, she had to accommodate me, so it worked out.  All right, wait a minute.  Oh, sure.  Hold on.  Let's slow down, guys.  Slow down.  So, I got to get the visual here.  Yeah.  You're 13, Anthony.  You're banging Buzz.  Yeah.  While Dad's out doing his thing.  Uh-huh.  And Joe's in the bed.  I think I was probably 14 at this time.  All right.  And Joe's in the bed next to you, banging a 32-year-old?  No, a different room.  Oh, no, no.  He was in a different room.  It was a hallway and then two rooms at the end of each hallway. 
[02:34:00]  Did you hear each other going at it?  I don't think so.  It was Peter Frampton was playing.  They always used to put the Frampton Comes Alive album on.  Come on.  I swear.  Sue would always put the Frampton Comes Alive album on blasting.  And all we heard was, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Don't you feel like we do?  Ah, ah, ah.  That wasn't Frampton.  That was actually you going down on fuzz.  Well, you know what?  The old man hooked me up with her as well.  I mean, the old man did a lot for us that way. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, there it is.  There's some Frampton.  Is this bringing back memories, boys?  Oh, it's bringing back such memories.  Jesus.  Yeah, I think the old man was banging Sue also.  Probably.  Yeah.  All right, wait.  So, Joe was a little older.  So, you were only 15 or 16 banging the 32-year-old?  Yeah, I was about 16, I guess.  Yeah, and he was banging the 32-year-old and wanted to switch at midnight.  What, you guys had a little conference in the hallway?  Yeah, yeah.  In between bangings?  We saw Sue breaking out the Frampton album. 
[02:35:00]  We knew we were getting laid.  Real tag team.  Yeah, so Joe wanted to do the switch.  And, man, I had, believe it or not, buzzed with the unibrow, the big 70s Earth Mama Muff,  the big Amazon woman was bad enough.  But this is telling how bad Sue was.  I wanted no part of her.  There was nothing about Sue that was turning me on.  She was much too old.  She was thin, though.  She was thin.  She was small.  She was emaciated.  She had flapjack tits. 
[02:35:30]  She had two kids who were in the other room.  She had two kids in the other room.  Wait, wait, wait.  In the other room?  Yeah, there was another room that the kids were in.  This was a flop house.  Oh, that was ridiculous.  I swear to God, man, I would have gone through five Sue's before I would have taken one buzz.  You wanted buzz.  You were the one that recommended the switch, that suggested the switch at midnight.  Dude, that was because I was 15, and I figured, what the fuck?  We were just scrolling around.  It would be fun, something to do.  Switch it up a little bit. 
[02:36:00]  Horrifying.  What were the kids doing while you were banging their mother?  Probably playing with Legos.  Who the hell knows?  Who the hell knows?  Did they call you Daddy Joe?  I remember the girl.  The girl walking in one time on me.  Oh, great.  The little girl walking in one time.  She was like seven.  I know, and she was only about maybe six years younger than me, right?  Can we find any of these people?  Who knows?  I don't know what the hell's going on in California.  Sue's probably got the eighties.  Which hippie colony should we check? 
[02:36:30]  You guys are a bunch of hippies out there.  Who are hippies?  Tom Jones last night.  Who knows?  Probably.  She's old.  Old broad.  Joe, you had a great father, man.  I'm telling you.  He liked to party, that's for sure.  He gave you guys pooh-ha, man.  I remember, yeah.  Guns, alcohol, and the bitches.  He hooked us up.  Guns, horses, booze, bitches.  My dad gave me a good jump shot.  There you go.  That's what I got from my dad.  A good jump shot.  I used to come. 
[02:37:00]  And really good ball handling skills.  And you guys are getting pooh-ha, man.  I used to come home from school.  I went to Marco Forrester Junior High School.  And it was right by the stable where we kept the horses.  So I would get done with school about 3 o'clock, walk back to the stable.  And every day, my father, who for some reason couldn't hold a job, was sitting in a chair  with Chato, the Mexican guy that had a horse at the same ranch.  And they would just sit there drinking what they called yambos.  They were the big 40-ounce beers. 
[02:37:30]  Why don't we get another yambo, Yoey?  And then they'd sit there just drinking beer.  And when their wives or girlfriends would bitch at them, they would look at each other  and go, eh, I'm going to get me another one.  And this was their life.  Riding horses, drinking, and screwing girls like Buzz and Sue.  Yeah.  So he was getting us right in line to do that.  Drinking beer, riding horses, and screwing women.  Making homebrew.  And making the homebrew.  They used to get these casks from these whiskey factories. 
[02:38:00]  Big wooden barrels.  And they would take them back to the ranch, fill them up with like five gallons of water,  and then roll it.  Every couple of days, you'd roll it, like a quarter roll.  And then after a month, you'd drain it out, and you'd get one gallon of liquid that would come out.  But it was like pure alcohol.  That would leach out of the wood from the cask.  And we're kids, and they're giving us shots of this stuff.  We were fucked up. 
[02:38:30]  I mean, completely hammered.  What a great way to be raised.  Dude, you drank a glass.  You had it on the rocks.  Yep.  And stood up from a...  That's how I drank at 13.  On the rocks.  On the rocks.  Go ahead, Joe.  Joey.  Yo.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  And you proceeded to go straight down to your knees.  Oh, yeah.  Took a big shot and just went thud.  Passed out.  It was great.  Why straight down to your knees?  Buzz was standing in front of Anthony there? 
[02:39:00]  No, I wouldn't have gotten on my knees for Buzz, that's for sure.  Looked like tumbleweed rolled in our lap.  All right.  You know what?  To wrap this up, you guys got to tell the story of Mom finally calling out to California  and going, boys, it's time to come home.  I think she was a little concerned for your safety.  Oh, that was when we, yeah, we had decided it was time to come back east and maybe get  civilized for a little while.  I was just coming back to visit.  Joe, of course, was coming back to live there.  But after I visited with my family here in New York for a while, I realized I was kind 
[02:39:30]  of programmed in California and they kind of deprogrammed me here in New York and I  decided I better stay because I really was heading on the road to ruin out there.  It's funny how you guys got back home.  You had to take the bus trip, right?  Well, my mother had sent out two airline tickets for me and my brother to fly us from California  to New York.  So my father got the tickets, went to the airline, sold the tickets, took the money and bought  us two Greyhound bus tickets and put us on the bus. 
[02:40:00]  And there we were on this two-week-long excursion.  But you can't be pissed at him because he gave you puha, man.  There you go.  I'm alone with hookers and pimps.  Yeah, so we were taking a bus all the way from California, L.A., to New York City.  And it stopped at every city.  You know, we stopped everywhere.  And the collection of dregs of society, male hookers, hustlers, girl hookers, pimps.  And I'm talking like huggy bear pimps. 
[02:40:30]  These guys with the fur hats and everything.  It was just a collection.  And we were drinking an ouzo bum who had a bottle of ouzo with him the whole trip that  everybody, when he passed out, would take and pass around the bottle.  And we were drinking this bum's ouzo.  This hot chick we met that was getting off in Cheyenne but decided to hang out with us  all the way into New York.  Who knows what happened to her?  Probably murdered or ended up a hooker.  And then we finally get to New York after two weeks on the road.  And right when we step off the bus, we get arrested by NYPD. 
[02:41:00]  This detective comes over.  Came up to me and grabbed me by the shoulder and said,  Excuse me, boys, you have to come with me.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  And now you left out the fact that I was smuggling in tie sticks.  Right.  Now the cop goes, Come with me.  Get your bags.  And we're like, Oh, my God.  Joe's got, like, pounds of tie stick.  How old were you, Joe?  Oh, God.  Probably 17 now.  I think you were 17.  Okay.  I was about 17. 
[02:41:30]  16, 17.  And just, like, a load of tie stick in his bag.  And the guy goes, We're going to get your bags.  And we're going to check you out, you know, because they thought we were runaways.  They thought we were runaways coming into New York to, you know, hustle or something.  So, thank God that girl did follow us from Cheyenne and just hang out with us on the bus.  We told her, Could you get this one bag and get it immediately before we get there?  And she ran and got the bag and actually didn't steal it and took it.  And then the cop goes to call my mom up. 
[02:42:00]  And I'm like, Could you just identify yourself and first say, Your kids are fine.  I'm NYPD.  And I just took them.  And I want to verify that they're not runaways.  He gets on the phone.  Hello, Rosemary.  Yes.  Do you have two sons, Joseph and Anthony?  Yeah.  And you just, my mother's horrified.  This guy just strung it along without, like, telling her we were okay.  Guy was a real prick.  But we got off the hook.  Remember the knives that the old man gave us? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  He, like, confiscated our knives.  On his side.  And the cop was patting me down.  You know, he goes, Oh, what's this?  What's this?  Put his hand over by his gun.  Takes the knife away from me.  Yeah, what a collar.  Yeah.  What a collar, getting the Kumia boys.  Goddamn hysterical.  Well, thank you for the memories, Joe.  I forgot about Sue.  All right.  More stories than that, though.  For another day, all that Mojave Desert.  Oh, I know.  Shootings and everything.  Yeah, we'll talk about the shooting next time you call in.  I saw more shootings than Puffy. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  On an entire show, too.  Yeah, that's a great story.  But you're going to have to tell it live in the studio, though.  But, Joe, bashing Buzz when you're banging a Sue is a little much.  Come on.  She was this mousy woman with these big glasses.  Remember Sue's big dopey?  She looked like Tweety Bird.  She had these big glasses.  Hi, Joe.  I got my glasses, and I'm going to bang you to Peter Frampton.  Ow, my ass hurts from last night. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that's funny.  Don't bang my Cro-Magnon woman.  I don't know, man.  Who would you rather fuck, Tweety Bird or Mike Tyson?  I was screwing Sasquatch.  No shit.  That's great.  All right, brother Joe.  All right.  Cool, man.  I'll talk to you, Joe.  All right, guys.  Hey, Bruce Mayden.  He's going up to the Big League.  The Boston Red Sox.  Red Sox.  O and A return next week for a live broadcast from Boston.  It's still tough?  Come on.  Catch the virus at Bill's Bar before the Sox opener. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, and make sure you remove your eyes.  O and A.  That's a little too cute.  So, okay.  Yeah, there you go.  Uh, XM Satellite Radio's Bruce Kelly here with another Opie and Anthony, interlocular.  The worst of O and A.  Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite.  Does that mean the phrase shock jock finally gets erased from the English language?  Well, unfortunately, no, because that's how we'll always be labeled. 
[02:44:30]  Shock jock.  What the hell does shock jock mean anyway?  Shock jock.  Are people really shocked by now if they listen to this type of programming?  Oh, don't you just pick someone looking at the radar going, oh!  Like they're just shocked at what you just said.  It's a bunch of crap.  It is crap.  It's the media that's very lazy and they have to label everything.  Well, we'll just label it shock jocks instead of really getting into it and seeing what we're all about.  And they would find out that's a lot different than the perception out there. 
[02:45:00]  You know, we're funny, entertaining, clever at times.  And also shocking, sure.  But that's not all we do.  Can anybody really be shocked in American culture anymore?  Sure they can.  They're dummies.  Americans are shocked that there was a gay governor.  They're fucking morons.  They're very easily shocked because they're dishonest and their morality is based on what  they think things should be instead of the way they really feel.  Yeah, they're fucking morons.  Yeah, listeners to this show, I don't think, could be shocked that easily.  But yeah, Jim makes a good point.  The average citizen still finds a lot of things out there shocking, which I wouldn't even blink at. 
[02:45:30]  They're shocked that two guys would blow each other when they get married.  I mean, they're very easy to shock people, extremely easy.  They're morons.  And I mean you.  When you guys were off for two years, how close were you during that time?  Not very.  Oh.  Because when it comes down to it, it was Anthony's idea for the church thing.  And to this day, I'm not too happy with that.  I resent that wholeheartedly.  I left a lot of messages for the guys just to tell them that I was still around.  Hi, guys, just in case you start up again.  No, we actually kept in touch and we did a radio show for each other. 
[02:46:00]  That was a lot of fun to make each other laugh instead of over a million people.  That's worse.  I would hear the phone ring.  I'd look, see who it is.  The message, you know, and I wouldn't answer it.  And then I'd check the message.  It's like, Ant, it's Opal.  Beep.  To undelete message.  Press three.  I didn't even listen to the goddamn thing.  I knew what it was going to be.  Stop.  Hey, what's up?  Nothing.  I'm still out of work, Ope.  How about you? 
[02:46:30]  I was quantum leaping all over the United States.  Every time Anthony called me, I was somewhere else.  Yeah.  Wow, man, I didn't know you could get cell service at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  This is pretty cool.  Wonderful, Ope.  Call me when you get to Phoenix.  Now, back to the worst of Ope and Anthony on XM202 High Voltage.  Hey, guys, you're enjoying the worst of Ope and Anthony, or you wouldn't be listening  right now, right?  That's true. 
[02:47:00]  I was going to say, how do you know they're enjoying it?  But the fact that they're listening means they must be enjoying.  You know what?  They just called us for lunch, so let's make this one very easy.  Three words.  Recipe for murder.  The worst of Ope and Anthony.  The Ope and Anthony Show.  Today's episode, Recipe for Murder.  MMIV.  The Ope and Anthony Show, Act One. 
[02:47:30]  Ope and Anthony Show.  Today's episode, Eat, Drink, and Be Murdered.  With special guest star, Robert Conrad.  A Quinn Martin production.  A Quinn Martin production.  Ope and Anthony, today's episode, Hide and Go Murdered. 
[02:48:00]  MMIV.  Epilogue.  We're not at the epilogue yet.  All right, that's during What Did We Learned.  Yeah, the epilogue will be What Did We Learned.  Ope and Anthony Show.  Today's episode, Hickory Dickory Murder.  Oh, God.  Yeah, welcome to the Ope and Anthony Show.  It's the O-Day virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:48:30]  And we want to say hi to everyone that got their XM radios turned on overnight.  Turn it on.  And by the way, you know, let's put an end to this.  We are not moving back to afternoon radio.  We did it.  We kicked serious ass.  Yeah.  And we're moving on with this new venture, okay?  People are begging us at times to move back to afternoons.  We're just not going to do it.  This is...  I'm one of those people begging.  Believe me.  Honestly, our lives would be a lot better.  Yeah.  But we already did that, and it just doesn't make sense when you're doing a national radio  show now. 
[02:49:00]  Because, you know, we're known on the East Coast big time.  Big effing time.  But the whole West Coast is now listening to us as well, okay?  And you can't...  If we're doing afternoons in the New York Times zone, you can't give the West Coast a  show that's 24 hours old in the morning.  You just can't do it.  Doesn't work.  So let's stop the discussion.  We're here to stay.  We want to make this work.  Plus, we're kind of sleepy in the morning, and a lot of crazy stuff comes out.  A little punchy.  Yeah, like this freaking recipe for murder stuff. 
[02:49:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Today's episode, stop in the name of murder.  A Quinn Martin production.  Opie and Anthony on after Canon on CBS.  Yeah, we got in here early.  We were getting the show together and just started talking about the old TV programs. 
[02:50:00]  The old TV shows.  Don't you miss them sometimes?  I was just noticing everyone has to be beautiful on TV these days.  And we brought up Canon for some reason and then Kojak.  And Opie said he caddied for Telly Savalas.  I caddied for Telly Savalas, I don't even know, man.  I guess probably in the mid-80s or something like that.  Give me a putter, baby.  He came to the Huntington Crescent Club, and the guy was missing all sorts of parts off his body. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, but it didn't matter back then.  You know, supposedly he had a fake ear on the show.  Yeah, they put a fake ear on him, and it was missing like a finger or something, piece of his finger.  He was missing a couple digits.  A couple of digits?  I think so, and I do remember seeing like no ear.  Hey, caddy, look for my ear in the woods over there.  Come on, baby.  Who loves you, baby?  Where's my golf ball?  He was playing golf and sucking on the lollipops.  Oh, his trademark lollipop.  Oh, yeah, and he would walk to his ball.  Where's my ball, baby? 
[02:51:00]  He had a big Aaron Neville mole on his cheek and stuff.  And he was like one of the hottest stars in Hollywood.  Yeah.  The guy was all over television.  Yeah, you couldn't.  Oh, there you go.  Kojak, a Quid Martin production.  M-C-M-L-X-X-I-I.  Uh, what?  They always got to figure out what year it was.  That would be 1970-something.  Tonight's episode, recipe for murder. 
[02:51:30]  With special guest star, Charo.  Charo.  Charo.  Coochie, coochie girl.  Yeah, Kojak would walk into a nightclub and she'd be performing.  And she'd have to help Kojak find the clues.  And Kojak got all the babes, even though he was a mess.  Oh, he'd walk into some of those clubs to, like, get some info from some informant or something. 
[02:52:00]  And the girls would come up, hey, Kojak.  And, hey, baby.  He'd be hugging him.  Like, ugh.  Like, you talk to my mole and I'm going to talk to this woman over here.  Ugh, baby.  A Quid Martin production.  They put them all out.  Mannix.  Mannix.  Oh, my God.  Mannix was the private investigator.  It was like $100 a day plus expenses.  Whoa.  He's a fucking expensive guy.  And Cannon.  The big fat guy, Cannon.  And the opening sequence wasn't believable. 
[02:52:30]  He's running around in the hills of California with a little six-shooter chasing some guy.  Cannon's not catching anyone.  And then I kind of liked it because he was the first portable phone.  Right.  First car phone ever.  And I thought it was the coolest thing.  And it was a phone with the little spindly cord like you'd have at home that went into the hump in the middle of his console.  And he'd pick it up and go, mobile operator, get me Klondike 51350. 
[02:53:00]  Right away.  Right away, Mr. Cannon.  Like, he couldn't make a call.  He couldn't just dial a number.  Mobile operator.  I need 555-8383.  What was bigger, Cannon's phone or the little doggy company's satellite radio?  Ooh, good question.  I have the Cannon satellite radio.  It's huge.  Ooh, is that the Cannon theme? 
[02:53:30]  They'd be playing this music.  And it's a whole montage of scenes on the screen of him running, chasing, and even womanizing.  You love my fat, don't you?  Back then, you didn't have to be pretty to be on TV.  Now, you know, you've got to look like the cast of The O.C. or Smallville or something in order to be on television.  That's why poor little Jimmy Norton doesn't get all the parts that he should get.  He's a great little actor, but perhaps, you know, people like me and Jimmy, you just can't get on television. 
[02:54:00]  Thank you.  Yeah.  I'm not that good at that.  What was that other show?  We were talking, I was talking to you about it.  McMillan and Wife?  McMillan and Wife.  A Quinn Martin production.  It's a nice name.  It's the good old days, right?  McMillan and the bitch he has sex with.  Just end wife.  McMillan and the girl he's with tonight.  McMillan and still friends.  McMillan and ex-wife, but still on good terms. 
[02:54:30]  A Quinn Martin production.  Or Banachek.  Banachek.  Who was the pitch meeting for that show?  Okay, it's going to be great.  Wait, this guy works for an insurance company.  Hold on, I've got to go backwards.  Wasn't Rock Hudson McMillan?  Yes, he was.  Gay guy.  And he was always, you know, very loving with Susan St. James, who was wife.  She played wife.  Wife.  And they would solve crimes together. 
[02:55:00]  Ugh, what a nightmare that would be.  What are you doing?  We probably started out, yeah.  Why aren't you home yet?  I'm working.  Why can't I come along with you?  She probably didn't believe him and had a tag along.  I'm McMillan.  I'm a cop.  I got work to do.  I'm the guy.  I'm your wife.  I'm the guy.  I should be by your side supporting you and solving crimes.  You know, one of these days you're going to turn me gay, woman. 
[02:55:30]  I'd rather have AIDS than take you along.  Oh, I do?  On tonight's episode, watch McMillan's T-cell count drop.  McMillan and wife try to track down his T-cells.  Tonight's episode, butt sex for murder.  For murder.  Murder.  Yeah, Banachek was, what was his name?  The actor?  I can't remember. 
[02:56:00]  That would be George Pappard.  George Pappard, who later went on to the A-team.  Yes, George Pappard.  And breakfast at Tiffany's.  And breakfast at Tiffany's, yes.  George Pappard was Banachek.  And the plot was he worked for an insurance company.  And he would go around trying to find missing insured stuff.  What a great show.  Always with a drink and a cigar.  And he'd put on his gloves and try to track down, like, missing boxcars and missing vases. 
[02:56:30]  That was insured for a million bucks.  My company doesn't want to pay for that.  I'm going to track it down.  I believe you had it stolen.  And the whole episode is him tracking down some merchandise that was insured by his company.  Oh, who's watching that?  Banachek.  A lot of people did back in the day.  Oh, what about the...  Ode to a missing armoire.  M-C-M-L-X-X-I-V. 
[02:57:00]  That was made in the 1800s, I think.  How is that possible?  Banachek was made in 1882.  Oh, we didn't even know we were going to do this today.  We just were goofing around before the show.  I loved it, though.  But when you said recipe for murder.  Recipe for murder.  With the cheesy graphic.  Now it's all about Flash, you know.  You watch a TV show, the opening credits get awards now.  Because they're all done, it's a CGI and very flashy. 
[02:57:30]  That was like typewriter written stuff superimposed on bad stuff they cut out of episodes.  It was a little shaky.  You know, you'd see the recipe for murder and it's shaking on the screen.  What does that say?  What?  Loved it.  Grew up watching all that Quinn Martin crap.  Let's go to Jim in North Carolina.  The streets of San Francisco.  And there's a guy called Malden who just did not belong on TV. 
[02:58:00]  Another guy that didn't belong on TV.  Big alcohol ravaged cauliflower nose.  And Michael Douglas was on that one.  That was his first big break before he started hitting colored people in the balls with golf balls.  And laughing about it on the golf course.  The streets of San Francisco.  Tonight's episode, vagot murder.  Come on, it's San Francisco. 
[02:58:30]  MC MLXX.  Bam!  V.  V.  1975.  Running around the streets of San Francisco solving gay crime.  Cross-dressing murder.  All the groovy music solving gay crime.  Gay crime in San Francisco. 
[02:59:00]  Tonight's episode, Michael Douglas goes undercover in a bathhouse to find a killer of gay men.  In Get Me a Towel, I've Been Murdered.  Tonight's episode, I Left My Murder in San Francisco.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say hi to Jim in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, originally from Jersey. 
[02:59:30]  I'm a Marine station down here, but glad you guys are back on the air.  Oh, cool, bro.  Hey, remember Vegas with Dan Tanna?  Yeah, he had a bunch of shows.  Yeah.  Vegas.  What was the one where he was in Boston?  Oh, that was, uh, Ben's got the squirts today, so.  Spencer for hire.  I'll hear it now.  Our Boston connection is not here.  Spencer for hire.  With the black-eyed hawk.  Spencer.  Spencer for hire.  All right, thank you, Jim.  Hi. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, yeah, Bob's got one of my old favorites.  Bob and Jamestown.  Literally, old favorites.  Good.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning to you.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  Hey, Barnaby Jones.  You haven't mentioned it.  Barnaby Jones.  That's a great pitch, too.  I'd love to be in the pitch meeting for that.  Yeah, there's, how many detective shows are on now?  There's 87 on all the networks.  I got one more.  But the guy's 80 years old.  What about a detective who's 80 years old?  What? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, Barnaby Jones.  Barnaby Jones, the geriatric gumshoe.  Tonight's episode, I'd love to catch the murderer, but my prostate's inflated.  Barnaby Jones, M-C-M-L-X-X-B-I.  1971.  Very early in the decade, 1971.  And he went, Barnaby Jones, Act One.  Barnaby. 
[03:01:00]  What was his son's...  Oh, he didn't have a son.  He was a nephew.  Jebediah.  Jebediah.  Jebediah Jones.  Because that was the young...  Because you had to get, like, a young guy in there to get the chicks.  To get all the little hippie chicks of the day that were biting into hot dogs and screaming  because they were talking back to them.  Another guy that looked like he shouldn't be on TV.  Yeah.  You're putting an 80-year-old guy on television running around.  Another guy running around chasing young hoods.  And he's 80 years old.  Yeah.  Old guy.  Barnaby Jones. 
[03:01:30]  And the bad guys are always the same guys on all the shows.  You'd have, like, John Cassavetes or that dude from The Man From Uncle.  Man From Uncle.  That guy.  I forget his name.  Robert Vaughn.  Robert Vaughn, exactly.  Tonight's guests are Robert Vaughn.  That's my brother, Darren, by the way.  The king of useless information.  It's ridiculous what he remembers.  Hairpiece for murder starring Robert Vaughn.  Co-motiver or murder. 
[03:02:00]  I love those shows.  I can hear the murder thing all day now.  Every episode.  Just all day, just come up with another one.  Very original.  Oh, which one's this?  I don't know this one.  This says The Girl From Uncle, not The Man From Uncle.  Oh, jeez.  I thought I was going to hear one of the classics.  The girl on her uncle.  That stinks.  Was that an actual TV show? 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  Barnaby Jones.  Let's go to Wayne and PA.  Tonight's episode wasn't murder or did I just forget?  Wayne, what's up?  Hey, what's wrong, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you're missing one.  Don't forget the Hawaii Five-0 there.  Book them, Dan-o.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That was another one when they had those stupid car phones there.  It was like a receiver from a rotary phone there.  Did you yank it out the window?  Yeah, they would pull like regular phones and they'd be in their car talking on the phone.  But as a kid, it was like, this is the coolest guy ever. 
[03:03:00]  I used to think Mannix was like the coolest guy ever.  Detective, womanizing, kind of drinking, smoking.  And that $100 a day plus expenses.  It's just like, God, he's raking in some heavy-duty cash.  Beginning, he's running across that bridge.  Someone's chasing him.  Not afraid to run, Mannix.  Mannix.  Run away for murder.  Oh, yeah.  Real jazzy. 
[03:03:30]  They'd always end up trying to get information in those lounge-like, lowly-lit clubs.  With the red candle on the table and the big button-tuck red couches.  Let's sit down with a martini.  Spill it.  Spill it.  All right, Mannix.  Yeah, I was there, but I didn't do it, I swear.  Right.  All right, you lousy hood.  Go.  Take a walk.  He's got enough info.  Well, what time is it?  Three o'clock?  I made a hundred bucks.  I could go home and go to sleep now.  Mannix. 
[03:04:00]  Barely ever worked.  He's on the job like two hours a day.  Okay, that's enough.  I'll solve the murder tomorrow on Mannix.  MCMLXX.  V.I.  1976?  Oh, very good.  You also had Harry O., which was like Mannix's light.  Harry O.  Yeah.  Right.  And that was, what the hell is his name?  David Jansen. 
[03:04:30]  David Jansen.  He died early from, he probably lived a life when he was off the air.  Lived a life he was portrayed on television.  Yeah.  David Jansen from The Fugitive.  Scott in Ohio.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, what about Beretta?  Yeah, well, that's kind of how we originally started talking about this before the show even started.  That's right, because Robert Blake, three years after he allegedly killed his wife, woman there,  he's still in jail, and now they're just picking a jury, and we were saying, what the hell happened to a speedy trial? 
[03:05:00]  If this isn't a case of being denied your constitutional right to a speedy trial, three years, and no one's talking about that.  It's not anything I read in any of the news reports.  Why can they hold this guy for three years before bringing him to trial?  Unbelievable.  Got to let him out.  Not a flight risk.  Where's he going to hide?  Where's Beretta going?  Where's old Beretta going?  Young Beretta might have fled.  Come on, I'm leaving with you, rummy. 
[03:05:30]  You old rummy.  Yeah, that's how that started.  Yeah.  Oh, I loved Beretta.  Used to watch that every week.  Keep your eye on the sparrow.  You remember that.  We're on the barring.  Sammy Davis.  Yeah, babe.  Sammy sung this?  Yeah.  Don't go to bed.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  No price on your head.  No, no. 
[03:06:00]  Should have taken the advice of his song before he shot his wife.  Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  Yeah, groovy.  Big Afro black people on the show.  Fly on the sparrow.  That is cockatoo.  Fred.  Fred.  Yeah.  It's narrow. 
[03:06:30]  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  M-C-M-L-X-X-V-I-I-I-V.  Where can I go?  Well, just I-I-I.  I-I-I.  I-I-I would work, sure.  Stupid Roman numerals.  Why didn't they just put the date at the bottom of it?  Next week, the virus infects Boston.  Strap in, kids.  It's O&A Live from Bill's Bar before the home opener.  We'll bring the bat.

It's right here, it's right here, it's right here.  No, no, no, no.  You've got to go out of the machine.  Yeah, sit down, Bernie.  It's in the thing.  It's right there.  Oh, yeah, sit down.  I'll get it to you.  We're going to say goodbye to you.  Bernie.  No, no. 
[03:08:00]  This one, right?  It says arm on the front.  Oh.  What are you?  You motherfucker.  Tony.  Tony.  Oh, he's coming over.  Oh, Bernie, Bernie, sit down.  Sit down.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  He's really mad.  He's mad.  You pissed off, Bernie.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.

Poe, it's okay.  Poe, it's okay.  Poe, it's okay.  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh, Paul.  I'm not able to get that fucking CD.  He handed over.  Yeah.  Hand over that fucking CD.  Oh, you're going to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie. 
[03:09:00]  He's straight to me.  Oh, he's fine, Paul.  You tell him to relax.  Paul, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  I mean.  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep your CD out.  We'll be here again.  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie!  Bernie's leaving!  Oh, man.  So you got his CD?  Give him his CD.  Oh, you ruined it.  Bring him back in.  Give him his CD.  No, we'll explain what happened.  We'll explain what happened.  Bring him back in.  Bernie!  Bernie!  Oh, he's going into his bag.  What?  He's going into his bag. 
[03:09:30]  No, he's at Bernie.  It's okay.  He's zipping up.  Bernie, we got the CD.  We got the CD.  Follow him out with the cell phone.  Oh, he took a fake.  It wasn't his CD.  Oh, wasn't his CD?  No, of course not.  And he lost his mind.  Of course not.  Did you get him his CD?  Well, Eric's going after him.  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it.  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV where the guy finally snaps on the stand.  Finally cracks him.  The lawyer cracks him.  All right, I did it.  See?  All right, hold on.  I think...  And I'm not sorry.  I'd do it again.  All right, let's go to the phones here. 
[03:10:00]  Jesus.  Bernie, this is your CD right there.  Okay, thank you.  That's not the one he...  Relax.  That's not the one.  That's yours.  Tell him...  That's the one he used in the studio.  Eric, explain.  Explain what we do.  Bernie, the joke.  He had another CD.  Oh, whatever.  It was a separate CD.  Sure?  It was totally...  Take a look at it.  It's not even broken or damaged.  Anyway, it's okay.  Why don't you relax?  Why don't you relax?  No, no, no.  I want to go...  It's 9 o'clock.  They want to go home anyway.  Okay.  They still want to call to you.  Go back inside and at least let's not burn bridges. 
[03:10:30]  Let's go back in.  Come back in and talk.  He's coming in.  All right.  Nice and relaxed.  Wait, that sounds scary.  All right.  Hold on.  He's coming in.  They just want to talk to you.  I hope he's building a barrier.  All right, Bernie.  All right, wait.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  No, it's 9 o'clock.  Bernie.  Let me explain what happened, though, Bernie, because we want to explain what happened.  Wait, put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  Yeah.  Let me explain.  Because we really like you.  We want you to be a friend of the show.  That's what Bernie gets, and I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here.  We felt like you were a friend of the show that we could pull one of our gags on you. 
[03:11:00]  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Here, I'm going to show you.  Calm down.  Here's the CD I was smashing.  Okay, I didn't know that.  Okay.  The CD I was smashing was called Haunted Pussy.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  It had nothing to do with the one that.  You were smashing Haunted Pussy.  You're smashing the best time.  Bernie, I never touched your CD.  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in and, you know, made the old switcheroo.  Bernie, we still pals? 
[03:11:30]  Things are okay.  All right.  Things are okay.  I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  A friend of mine.  I consider you.  Okay, or just, or whatever.  Bernie, look at your CD.  We didn't like it.  Bernie, it's not like, no.  It's okay.  Look at your CD.  There's not a scratch on it.  I didn't smash yours.  I trust you.  All right?  Don't have to look at it.  I thought we were at that stage in our friendship that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all.  Bernie's CD.  There you go.  All right, Bernie.  We're cool.  We're cool.  And anyway, that's the news for the week.  Thank you, Bernie.  The worst of O and A on high voltage. 
[03:12:00]  Don't stop tweeting.  I don't want to.  XM 202.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ozzy in studio.  It finally happened for a little Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  Thanks to my pals, Opie and Anthony.  We got to stay before we came down to D.C.  This was actually yesterday.  This is when we're taping this.  This was yesterday.  It's so fresh in your mind as we intro it now.  That's right. 
[03:12:30]  And little did I know that this beautiful, joyous day provided by my pals would be spoiled by a fat ape hooker at the end of the evening.  But this is still early in the morning, and my hero comes in the studio thanks to my pals, Opie and Anthony.  I get to sit with them.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What a fucking drag.  Ladies and gentlemen.  There he is.  Ozzy Osbourne.  It is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ozzy, we'll introduce everyone.  What's his name?  Opie, Anthony. 
[03:13:00]  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  Hi, Oz.  I forgot already.  I know.  It's okay.  I just wanted to say hi.  Nice.  You made it.  So happy you're here.  Thank God.  Don't ask me why.  I'll go in like a couple of hours ago, and I'm like...  Yeah?  You get up early these days or what?  Well, I got radio interviews, yeah.  Yeah?  It's kind of...  What time did you get up today?  Because it's kind of early for a rock star.  About 7.30.  7.30?  I went to sleep at 6.15.  6.15 in the morning?  Yeah.  Really? 
[03:13:30]  You go on that little sleep?  I've got no choice.  My wife's got a good left foot.  She kicks my butt out of bed.  Yeah, you can't sleep late anymore.  Go to work.  Can't you make her just realize you want to...  But she works harder than me.  But that's a great deal for you.  I think you should just relax.  Enjoy.  Thank you.  Enjoy yourself.  Thank you.  Get me some Quaaludes quick.  Because believe me, I love Sharon and everything, but I mean, it seems to me like these probably  are the years you should maybe be relaxing. 
[03:14:00]  You know, as we've gotten older together, we're getting more work now than ever.  Is that a good thing?  It could be worse.  It could be worse, but I don't know.  I could be Arab and have four wives who drive me nuts.  You enjoy it, though?  It's not like you're forced to be out of...  Because I've heard some accusations that people are like, oh, Sharon cracks the whip and Ozzy  goes and, you know, he doesn't want to work this hard anymore.  How many married men do you know that their wives don't crack the whip?  You are so right.  It doesn't matter what you do. 
[03:14:30]  They've got very many tactical ways of getting what they want out of you.  Even the Prince of Darkness has to put up with that.  Has to put up with the whip cracker.  I mean, I've even tried a wooden spike to a heart.  That didn't work.  I've got sprinters in my hands.  Then I got told up.  Whittling.  Yeah, boy, they can be tough.  That's for sure.  That's hilarious.  How are you feeling?  Your neck and your back and everything? 
[03:15:00]  I'm dumb.  I can't say the word.  No, you can say whatever you want.  You can say, fuck, shit here.  It's kind of fucked, man.  Is it?  I'm worth more in scrap metal now than anything else.  When I do it, they're going to melt me down.  They're fucking buying me, man.  When we heard about your ATV accident, it's like everybody assumed it was nothing and it was okay,  but it was pretty serious stuff.  But the dumb thing couldn't have been.  It was like chasing a bandit at 500 miles an hour.  Right.  Fucking three miles an hour, man.  Three miles an hour, would you capsize the thing?  That's really the Prince of Darkness speed. 
[03:15:30]  What did you hit?  The ground.  No, I mean, how do you fall off of it at three miles an hour?  Well, it's one of those.  I was going down a dip and instead of a screw kind of a screw, it's a leader.  My buddy, I put my hand on the handle and I pushed the leader.  Next thing I know, I was on morphine.  That was pretty cool, man.  On morphine, eh?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't want Leon to be the resident fucking morphine guy. 
[03:16:00]  Just keep me here.  I still feel a little pain.  No, but, you know, actually, I've had a big, major change in my life.  Yeah.  I don't smoke.  I don't drink.  I don't do dope.  I'm just, I'm boring my fucking self to do it.  This isn't just a phase, though, that you're going through.  No, no, I'm 11 months now.  11 months.  Which is the longest time I've ever gone.  Really?  Ever gone.  And this had to do with your accident?  No, because the wife could give me fucking shit.  Now, I heard you were pretty much dead at this point. 
[03:16:30]  Well, I didn't exactly want to run the fucking marathon.  No.  But did they have to bring you back to life or anything?  Yeah.  They got them fucking electric things.  What happened was when I smashed my clavica, or whatever the fucking thing is, the barn.  What was your shoulder blade?  Yeah.  It severed my artery and all my, and my lungs filled with blood and I was drowning in my blood.  I mean, I had to sort of put a thing in my lung to drain the blood.  Drain it out. 
[03:17:00]  And my heart stopped twice.  Jesus.  Did you see anything?  What?  Did you see anything when the heart stopped?  No, I wasn't really fucking looking.  At that point, I didn't go, darling, my heart stopped.  Look at that fucking beautiful bird up there.  To have some fabulous from this fucking ditch.  Honestly, I think he means some kind of afterlife thing, an image. 
[03:17:30]  But I saw some fucking afterlife thing.  I'm a ghost sitting there right now.  You make good sense.  I understand.  I was wondering if he saw the devil or something.  You know, a lot of people...  I'm married to him.  A lot of people see, you know, the nice white light and...  People say to me, did you see the light, the white light?  And I go, yeah, it was the fucking lamp above the bed when I was waking up.  That's what I think that's all about, by the way.  Bullshit.  Holy hosts of fucking angels going, Aussie, we have come to save you. 
[03:18:00]  He's like, oh, shut up, fuck it, and you got a gig tonight, you fucking asshole.  My wife, you know, in a sighting truck.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Well, thank God everything worked out.  I'll clear that up for you.  Okay, but 11 months now.  Yeah, yeah, 11 months.  Wow, that's really cool.  So what do you do to pass the time now that you're not doing the doping?  Masturbize.  One vice, you're still allowed, huh?  Yeah, thank God they don't take that away from us. 
[03:18:30]  But I'm on my mind, I'm beside you next week.  Yeah, well, I spent too much time in the jar, you know.  Do you miss the dope or the booze or nothing?  No.  He got fucking old, man.  I mean, you know.  Was that it?  At one time it was fun, but then it became a fucking pain.  Yeah, it kind of gets in the way of a lot of things, doesn't it?  Especially when you're fucking nodding up on a morphine in a fucking interview, you know.  Yeah.  Oh.  And now it must have been a little hard knowing what you went through and stuff to see your kids going through rehab. 
[03:19:00]  That's got to be a trick.  In actual fact, he spurred me on.  I mean, I've been trying for 20-odd years.  Really?  He just, with the series going so well on MTV, he used to be kind of like, they all went.  Because when you think, people go, oh, it must be so cool.  But when you think, every morning at 7 o'clock you open your bedroom door and there's a fucking crew and they're on and they're on and they're on your house, around your house, or wherever you go, all day.  And it's fun for about the first week or two, but then the fucking second year comes, you know, it's like, do you guys have a fucking home to go to? 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, it gets a little old, I'm sure.  And so the kids, plus the kids went from being kids to TV stars, and they were getting all kinds of flack from the public.  They were like, being really ridiculous and slutty.  Not everybody.  A lot of people were okay.  I think most people were okay with it, but there were just some people that were really ragging the kids, yeah.  You always got to whack jobs out there somewhere, you know.  Jealous.  I mean, the majority of the people were great, but the whole life switch really fucked with them, you know, and they started, you know, doing drugs and alcohol. 
[03:20:00]  Now, you were also, you were back on?  Well, when Sharon was diagnosed with colon cancer, that just, I just, my little plan was, I'll go first.  I mean, you've got to admit, guys, with the reputation that I had, I've got more chance of going before.  She doesn't smoke, she doesn't drink, and she ends up with colon cancer, and I'm, like, smoking bungs and running around the fucking house, vats of booze. 
[03:20:30]  Was there anything that was, like, ever shot that you just didn't want shown on the show that you said you got to do?  A lot.  Did they honor it, or did they show it anyway?  No, I mean, when you see a show, it's, like, 25 minutes, right?  They're filming from Monday at 7 o'clock till every morning, like, 4 o'clock in the morning, and they got that for a fucking week.  A week you could make a series, you know.  Right.  But the stuff, the trick to the show, I think, was the editing.  Yeah.  And we just did a wrap-up thing with Dr. Phil, who, incidentally, is a really cool guy. 
[03:21:00]  Really?  He really knows his stuff.  Really?  When I used to watch him, he said, another fucking...  Quack.  But he really is a nice guy.  Yeah?  He kind of helped, did he help it?  Fucking mad and went home.  You're all mad.  Did he help you out a little bit?  Yeah, but the guy's just a really nice guy, you know.  Yeah.  We had, like, a family thing, you know. 
[03:21:30]  Now, you being, going through what you went through with the drugs and stuff, you must have known and seen your kids falling into the same rut.  What, did you try?  Did you try to do anything?  You know what, it's like, I quit smoking cigarettes just over four years ago.  I just got a bit of a moment of reality, if you like.  I just thought, how can I tell my kids about not smoking with a fucking mulberry in my mouth?  Be an example.  And I never thought, I never thought that I would ever quit smoking. 
[03:22:00]  I thought I would die with one in my hand.  Yeah.  And one day I just went, people just say, how did you do it, Ozzy?  I just went, I took the patch up and all that shit, and threw the cigarettes on the fire.  And I made my mind up, you know.  People go, oh, I couldn't go anywhere without a cigarette.  You can if you want to.  It's one of those daily things, because I know I used to smoke.  It's one of those things where you know you're picking the cigarette up, so you just don't do it for that day.  The best two cigarettes of the day, first thing in the morning, last night. 
[03:22:30]  And the last night when I was fucking hammond, used to have a backlash when the fucking bed was on fire.  Nothing better than a nice cold beer and a cigarette, though.  A flaming pair of balls at four o'clock in the morning.  Hey, did you take Sabbath off the ballot at the awful Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which should just be a fire bomb?  No, no, no.  Let me explain the situation, the grief I used to have.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is run by people that are in the business, not by the people that don't go at the back of a music magazine. 
[03:23:00]  If you write and tell us who you think you'd like in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It's not fans.  I disagree with that principle because they, they, I mean, you could get a job or anybody could get a job in a record in one and get both of you on the panel.  And so I think Bruce Springsteen or Elton John or whatever.  And for years we were like on the list and I said, they ain't gonna fucking vote for this. 
[03:23:30]  They're musical snobs and they never gave you guys what they should have because you came from a darker place than like Aerosmith or all these other bands that are in there and that shouldn't have been in there before you.  Yeah, but then they had a really damning response to me, which I, I didn't go out for a fucking week.  It frightened me that much into the respect it was.  So, so lame, man.  So, what does Ozzy want?  An award for biting the most heads of the most bass?  So, give me a fucking hand job, you cuss. 
[03:24:00]  Like that's all you ever did in your career.  That's it.  I mean, you know, I mean, that's fucking, that proved my point actually.  Wait, you want a bit of, no, I won't go there.  Don't start, I'm fucking out of the coin.  I can still fucking use my right arm.  We got, in a little way, and I can relate to that.  You're talking about your penis again.  Yeah, because, you know, we got in a lot of trouble with our radio show.  We had this couple have sex at St. Pat's Cathedral, so now wherever we go, that's all they want to know. 
[03:24:30]  So, we can relate, on a small level, the whole bat question, the dove question, all that, that you've been asked thousands and thousands of times.  Who wants to hear it anymore, right?  Exactly.  Fuck it.  Well, it was like this.  Yeah, it was like this.  Oh, please.  What did the bats taste like?  I don't know, it's been that long ago.  I don't know what fucking bread tastes like.  I saw, you had a great answer for that on Letterman years ago.  You said, bats taste kind of salty.  Great response to that.  I've got to ask, this is kind of a dumb question, but, like, what is your greatest fear when you walk out on stage? 
[03:25:00]  Are you afraid when you walk out?  Every night, people say, I've been doing it for, like, 30-odd years now.  And people say, oh, you must have it done now.  I never, ever, ever, before I go on stage, I go to this inner torture.  Am I going to pull it off?  Are the crowd going to let me out?  Because sometimes you go on stage and you go, it's going good tonight.  And then you go on stage and the people go, are you feeling okay? 
[03:25:30]  Oh, no, really?  And you go, you think you're having a good time?  See, my perception is fucked.  My perception is all over the place.  And then when I think I'm doing a bad shit, they go, fuck it, I see you, and you get better with age.  And I like to say, it's like an invisible line.  Once you cross that line, you're on whether you're good, bad, or whatever.  Right, right.  I mean, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's fucking awful.  But you still go through it before every time you go out?  I don't, but this way, I don't need any laxatives.  Yeah. 
[03:26:00]  You know, I mean, the toilet is overflowing.  Yeah.  That's odd, because you would think, you know, for so many years doing it and stuff,  and you look, when you come out, you just look like an animal.  You look like the guy that, you know, is confident.  But I always think that, I always think the worst of Sharon goes to me, just stand there, you know.  I go, I can't, because I'm fucking me, you know.  Yeah.  Sharon says, no, no, you're 56.  None of this fucking jumping around anymore.  I just go, keep me at home, then if I can't do what I gotta do.  I'm gonna stand there like a fucking lemon. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  And then people say, oh, why is Ozzy not moving?  Then you get shit.  Look how he did die.  Just propping him up there, Dan.  In my concert, after that, like, ah, yeah.  The fucking, the Ozzy.  Hey, how'd you become friends with Elton John?  I saw that on one of the Osborne shows there.  It's a long story.  My, my, my wife used to hang around with him before she met, met, met, met me.  It just seems like a, a strange combination there.  I, I don't know, it's, it, it, it, it, it's just a really, I don't know, it just happened, 
[03:27:00]  you know, isn't it, he actually, he's a very nice guy.  Hey, that's a good guy, though, for your wife to hang around before she met you with.  You know, nothing was happening.  How with Elton John it wasn't.  How with Elton John.  You know, I don't, I don't, I never ask, but things like, you know.  I, you know, I, you know, I don't look at it, that's, look at,  any, I mean, any one of us could be homosexual.  I wouldn't know it.  Could be.  I'm not.  Could be.  Look around the room.  I'm not, um, yeah.  I'm not a homosexual.  No, don't look at me.  I was hoping you were going to look that way. 
[03:27:30]  Not over here.  I made the gender mistake with a hooker once.  I thought it was a chick, but it was a guy, but that's not gay, because I didn't know when  I went into it.  But you fucked her, yeah?  Well, no, I, I kind of finished, and I was like, ah, you got me.  And, you know, he left.  I, I, I, did you go poop shoot or what?  No, no, no.  I think he, I think he paid for a blowjob.  Yeah, it was a blowjob in Jersey, and I didn't know.  I wouldn't give a fucking shit.  It's been one of them.  Thank you.  Look at that.  I mean, I mean, I bet you, more than one person has done that, you know. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, thank you.  I think you're getting, uh.  He's the only one willing to admit it in front of a lot of people, though.  I mean, some of these, these, these transsexuals, you don't know the fucking difference.  Oh, they're lovely.  Looking a little nice, right?  These days, science, science and technology.  I could kickstart a fucking Harley every week, though.  You know what I've always wanted to ask you, too, is, uh.  No, I'm not one of them.  Oh, no, no, no.  We're out of training.  Uh, the original War Pigs, you guys had, like, it was an original version you did to War Pigs,  and then the lyrics, which were really, like, dark lyrics. 
[03:28:30]  Did the record company make you change that, or did you guys make a creative decision to do it?  Um, it's, it's, it's been that long ago, I can't even remember fucking making the record.  Did I make a record called War Pigs?  No, I mean, the only, the only one I do remember, um, volume four was originally going to be called Snowblowing.  And they said, no, no, you can't, you can't, it's, it's, it's, it's, in those days, it's, like, cocaine. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  It was, you couldn't mention, or anything, or any, have any connotations.  So, if you look in the inside cover, I think it's 12 and 4, I think it's 12 and 4, one of them.  Yeah, 5 and 4.  And it's got, we'd like to thank the great Los Angeles Coke, Cola Company, which is a little way of saying.  Right, you had to get it in there.  We did a lot of fucking blow on that album.  Troublemakers.  But, but, but, but, you know, you know, it's, it's got a lot more liberals and people like to sing about it now. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, now it doesn't matter, right?  What do you listen to these days?  Uh, I, I, I don't, I'm, I'm currently, um, doing some work with a colleague of mine on a Broadway musical about Rasputin.  Really?  It's, it's really good.  What I like about it, it's different, it's a different process than writing songs for an album, you know.  You can use a theme, leapfrog it in and out of the song, so, it's quite, it's quite interesting. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, a couple of, uh, you know, people with roots in rock and roll getting into Broadway, it seems to be the thing to do.  Well, I've been working on this for 10 years, you know.  Oh, see?  They're ripping you off.  This, this box set you got, uh, you cover some really interesting songs you do, In My Life and Sympathy for the Devil.  Yeah.  It's fantastic.  I had to, I had to have some, in my, my life, in my life, I, I heard, uh, I was watching this movie one day, and Bette Midler was doing this thing with this USO thing for the melody, and she, and there was a part where she goes into Vietnam, and I thought that, that's one of the least 
[03:30:30]  Beatles albums, records, songs that's been covered.  I mean, I, I've always wanted to do a version of White and Shared of Bale, but everybody and their fucking grandmother's done that.  Yeah.  So, I, I, I went and did the cover, there's a, actually, there's, up the road, there's a, a, a covers album called Ozzy Undercover, with a lot more different, different songs, as well as those, you know. 
[03:31:00]  What was the only one you'd done before that was, like, Evil Woman, I think, on the original, uh, Black Sabbath was the only cover.  I, I, I, I did, uh, for that Moscow Peach Summit, uh, Purple Haze for Doug McGee, and I, I, and the, the whole box set, and the, and the reason why it can't, I, I, I did, uh, cover, covers, because I've been on about doing it for, uh, quite a while now, and, um,  the, the, the record company, we've got to put, like, the fucking Miss Piggy, Born To Be Wild, and my wife says, why don't you, why don't you add that, that, that covers album, and it was, it was a lot of fun to make, actually, because it did, it wasn't, they were established songs, 
[03:31:30]  and we didn't, we didn't change them around that, that much, you know, because sometimes when you hear somebody go, do a cover or something, the only thing recognizable is the title, you know, so we, we kept it true, nearly as true to their form, and it turned out, I'm really pleased with it, you know.  You know one of the greatest things about you I've always loved, like, a lot of bands, like, headliners especially, will try to bring, like, a soft opener,  and you always seem to bring, like, the fucking best bands out there, I've seen you with Metallica, Motley Crue, when they were on fire, is there anybody you've ever been afraid to follow, or go on after? 
[03:32:00]  No, I, I, I, way back in the day, when, when, when Kiss happened, I mean, that was like a fucking revolution, I mean, in the service, we, we, we, we, we'd be, we'd go on after Kiss, they were up for us,  and the fucking audiences were, like, all their plays playing, and it's like, I don't think we're a bit lonely.  But, but, you know, I just plot on, I mean, I, it's been many a times, I was going, fucking hell, how am I going to get through this, you know, 
[03:32:30]  but I just plot on my own way, you know.  You actually watch the opening band, and just go, fuck, we're not going to follow this.  No, I don't, I, I try not to, because I, I, I, I either get influenced, or, or, or, I get pissed off, I like to,  I like to live, I like to live in my own little world before I go on stage, because, it's, it's, sometimes I'll do it, but not very often.  Right.  Hmm.  Man, look at, Jimmy's got a little picture of you on his shirt. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, yeah, but.  Jimmy's, uh.  You probably didn't get a dime for that.  Some bootleg.  No, I bought this at OzFest.  I won't buy anything bootleg Ozzy.  Oh, really?  Absolutely not.  Nothing bootleg, man.  Ozzy.  To him.  Ozzy, just so you know, Jimmy's, I mean, you're Jimmy's hero.  Simple as that.  Number one.  I don't suck cuck, Jimmy.  Number one fan.  Number one.  There's no one bigger in his mind than you.  No one.  Yeah, I'm just a bigger you.  It's really great to be chatting with you.  He spends half his time on this radio show talking about you.  Yep. 
[03:33:30]  You're my man.  I think you've been ripped off by a lot of bands.  I discussed that a lot.  I think you, too, stole Sunday Bloody Sunday from Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.  No, we stole the Sabbath Bloody Sunday from Sunday Bloody Sabbath.  Oh, shit.  Oh, look at that.  I love your argument.  Ozzy, never a stranger to controversy.  Of course, you know, the bat thing and the Alamo and stuff.  Now I see you turning up in the papers.  The latest controversy, cosmetic surgery.  Well, I had my dick shortened.  All right, you heard it here. 
[03:34:00]  There you go.  It's an exclusive.  That's it.  Screw page six.  Screw whatever they're saying.  He had his dick shortened.  They had a story about you.  I don't know.  It was getting fat injections and...  What the fuck do I want to have a fat injection?  If I get up and work out on a life cycle for two fucking hours anyway.  Yeah, it was like they were taking...  That's a dumb idea.  What I was reading is it was taking...  It was an injection of speed so I could fucking pedal faster than I was going.  They were taking fat from your ass and injecting it in your face or something. 
[03:34:30]  What?  Were you reading the fucking paper upside down?  It says that you admitted I have had a facelift.  Yeah, my wife fucking smacked me in the chin right now. 
[03:35:00]  Ex-Bloody Black Sabbath singer came clean after years of denying he had gone under the knife.  Ozzy, 56, had insisted he lost his gaunt appearance by ditching drink and drugs  and switching to clean living.  But the rock wild man has now revealed I've had a face job and a new nose.  It bolstered my confidence to no end.  Do I look any different?  No.  In the pictures that they put...  If that's the truth, I'm going to get my fucking money back.  So you never said this?  That you've had a face job, no job? 
[03:35:30]  I don't know where they get this shit from.  I don't know.  Yeah, they're printing lies about you.  Probably not the first time, right?  Right.  Sometimes, I'm sure, you open up the paper, you read things and go like that.  I don't read it because I always get pissed off because I get it wrong.  You do get pissed off by that stuff still?  If I read...  I won't read the magazine, but once every bloomin' I go, oh, look at that.  Every time I look at it, I look at the one in a million.  It's something I don't want to fucking read.  Probably something about your family or something, right?  Not about my facelift or one. 
[03:36:00]  What was the craziest thing you read about yourself that obviously wasn't true?  Just recently, I was in London and there was an article on Black Sabbath and in bold writing,  he said,  Sabbath, you should fire Ozzy.  Now, I've never...  I've never rejoined Sabbath.  We had a reunion.  Because you'll never get a studio album out of them.  And the reason why I said I wouldn't do it...  I haven't...  No, the reason why I haven't done another studio album with Bill Ward, Tony, 
[03:36:30]  I haven't been geasable to myself, is because I said,  if the music that we wrote wasn't as good as when we left off,  what's the fucking point?  Man, you're a smart man.  Tony...  I mean, so many times, so-and-so, so-and-so's got back together,  and I've gone,  yeah, I'm fucking sorry.  You do the same thing we do.  That's great.  Yeah, you might as well leave it on a high note.  Just because, you know,  the four of us are getting together. 
[03:37:00]  If the music's...  I'd be a fucking idiot if I...  I like this radio station.  You know, you can say whatever you want.  I can be like,  oh, man.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  No restrictions, Ozzy, I know.  It's great.  It should be like seeing everybody.  It should be.  What's it going to hurt?  What the hell's it going to hurt?  My fucking...  My hair's in the back of my neck.  I'm going,  do I say it right?  I don't know.  Yeah, you're going to get so many trouble,  they're going to find me.  I'm going to have a chat with some guys in a fucking dry bar.  Throw it, man.  It doesn't matter.  Say what you want.  So, um... 
[03:37:30]  We have had attempts at doing an album,  but I don't know.  It just didn't feel right, you know?  And this time,  if we did do it,  and it's still on the burner, you know?  It's still on the back burner, you know?  If it's something coming out  as good as Paranauta or Massive Reality  or Volume 4,  then I'd be a fucking idiot not to do it,  but why should I do an album  that I'll go,  fuck,  it's Black Sabbath,  but it sucks.  You know what?  It's easy for you to say also  because you're doing very well these days. 
[03:38:00]  I mean,  you're making a lot of money and stuff.  Are there any of the other guys  that are really hip on doing something like that  just for financial reasons alone?  No, no, no.  They're doing all right.  I mean,  it takes four of us,  and if there's one out of the four  that's not into it for whatever reason,  it ain't going to be Black Sabbath  because I've played Black Sabbath songs  with great musicians.  They've had various singers  and different band members,  and in my opinion,  there's like two Black Sabbaths, 
[03:38:30]  the Aussie one and the Ronnie James deal.  I must confess,  I did like a couple of their albums  with Ronnie James deal.  Did that piss you off  when you heard it  and went,  ah, shit, this is good?  Because it was like a new Black Sabbath.  Yeah.  And I didn't do so bad  at the end of the day.  He did all right for himself.  Of course, yeah.  People still want to hear you do the songs.  I mean,  Theo tried to do War Pigs.  It was like,  you know, an Iron Man,  but...  But you know what?  I remember getting a lesson  just after about a year 
[03:39:00]  after he joined,  and he asked me for royalties  for him singing My Sons,  and I wrote back,  fuck you.  That's a nice answer, sure.  You've got to be surprised, too,  that after all these years,  it's like a lot of guys...  Are you winking at me?  I actually blink a lot,  but I probably am subconsciously doing it  because I'm just so happy you're here.  He's twitching a little bit.  He's all nervous  that Aussie's sitting right next to him.  Dude, I'm just like,  I'm just petrified.  I fucking forgot my question now. 
[03:39:30]  God damn it,  do I suck?  Aussie,  you threw him for a loop.  Fuck.  I love looking at you  flustered like this.  I'm just sitting here  like an idiot  with my hands folded,  not saying shit.  You don't understand.  When people call up  and critique you  the slightest,  he jumps all over him  like they're talking about  his mother or something.  really just defends you  like a tiger.  Well, it's like,  I know what it was.  It was amazing  how after all these years,  you're still putting out  stuff that's phenomenal.  Like Just Want You 
[03:40:00]  is one of the fucking  best songs you've ever done.  And Perry Mason is phenomenal.  That's like 30 years  after you started.  It's just amazing  that it hasn't tapered off.  I'm so happy for Zach Wilde.  His album went into the charts  at 50  and he must be fucking  higher than a fucking kite right now.  Yeah.  That's great.  That kid,  I've got to tell him,  for whatever bad things  he's about  and crazy  and whatever,  he has worked  his fucking butt up  since he left me.  He's a bad man. 
[03:40:30]  He just does not,  he's unstoppable, man.  Ozzy, give us a fuck you.  We're out of here.  Fuck you!
