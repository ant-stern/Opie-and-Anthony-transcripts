<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The January 8th, 2010, Opie and Anthony Show began with a shocking news story about a rape, focusing on the perpetrator's bizarre question about the victim's groceries.  The hosts then transitioned to a critique of Larry King Live, deeming it a reality show documenting King's mental decline, contrasting it with their equally scathing assessment of Anderson Cooper's interviewing style.  This led to a lengthy discussion about bad haircuts, fueled by callers' anecdotes of fights, sexual advances, poor workmanship, and even a barbershop using sandwich orders as codes for sexual acts. One caller recounted an experience with an Iraqi barber using a straight razor, while another detailed a barber who cut him, cried, and then asked for a tip.  The segment included a phone call from a potential barbershop employee, a plug for Patrice O’Neal's stand-up show, and a discussion about the college football playoff system featuring insightful commentary from Patrice O’Neal, who was present in the studio.

Next, the show delved into a highly offensive and racially charged discussion about the perceived physical differences between Black and white college football players, referencing Jimmy "the Greek" Snyder’s infamous comments.  This conversation, involving Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O’Neal, explored racial representation in sports, focusing on the perceived lack of "mediocre" Black individuals in high-profile roles.  This was followed by a rambling and comedic anecdote from another guest, Mars, about his failed cosmetology career inspired by the movie *Shampoo*.  The hosts mocked Mars's storytelling, culminating in plans to have him style another guest's hair on-air.  The segment also included a discussion of a Larry King Live blunder where King incorrectly stated that Roman Polanski did not murder Sharon Tate, playing the audio clip of the error.  Several other guests appeared throughout this portion of the show.  The segment ended with the usual "FU" line messages.

The following segment featured comedian Gallagher as a guest. Patrice O’Neal suggested Gallagher update his act, possibly abandoning his watermelon-smashing routine. Gallagher expressed frustration with his career, Showtime's support, and adapting to changing trends. The conversation frequently veered off-topic, covering left and right-handed baseball hitters, Gallagher's views on the number of US states, comparisons to Insane Clown Posse, a heated debate about race spurred by Patrice, a running gag about a studio assistant's unmanageable hair, and Gallagher's songwriting.  The discussion included apologies between Gallagher and Patrice following the contentious racial discussion.

The final segment continued with Gallagher, but escalated into a heated exchange between him and the hosts.  Opie and Anthony relentlessly teased Gallagher, using insults such as "lunatic," "gun nut," "alcoholic," "pedophile," and "racist."  The hosts questioned Gallagher's website's advertising practices, and numerous phone calls from listeners offered diverse perspectives on the situation. One caller pointed out that "oriental" is a racist term; another shared a story about Gallagher's Canadian TV appearance.  The hosts even called venues to inquire about Gallagher's ticket sales.  The conversation included racially charged humor and jokes about sex with women of different races stemming from a discussion about Tiger Woods's infidelity.  The segment concluded with Gallagher's final statement advocating for the preservation of the English language and criticizing pronunciation habits, particularly among Black speakers.  Throughout the entire show, there was significant use of vulgar language and sexually explicit humor.  The show also covered the reshuffling of late-night television, Opie's near-text to an ex-girlfriend, concerns about airport full-body scanners, reactions to viral videos from Twitter, the Gilbert Arenas gun incident, a Newark airport security breach, and a voicemail message from Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton and Patrice O’Neal were guests in the studio at different points in the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio.  We've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where, you know, language was realistic and raw. 
[00:00:30]  Destroy it.  Sexual content is realistic.  And just fucking people reacting with people is realistic.  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name.  Shit Radio.  All right, we hit a low.  We have contact.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hurts.  That's funny.  This is Shit Radio.  It fucking stinks.  It stinks.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Wow.  Morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show, the Friday edition.  There we go.  We are live January 8th, 2010.  Ah, 2010.  Jiminy Cricket.  2010. 
[00:01:30]  I go 2010.  2010 sounds like fucking the space age.  I know, but it's the same shit.  I know.  Although we now have cell phones.  Anthony's in the know, and he knows what's going on with Jay Leno, so we go to Anthony  Cumia for this exclusives.  Mark Dance.  Because he, yeah, now we're all just shooting the shit before the show, and Anthony's like,  I know.  I know what's going on with Jay Leno.  Here's what happened.  We were all speculating as to what was going to happen, and I had heard something on 1010 
[00:02:00]  Wins on the way in, on the news.  And then I said, I said what I said, and then I just said, well, that's what I heard.  And Ovi just goes, who are you?  A guy that heard the news.  What are we all doing?  I know.  Well, I'm hearing.  That's what I heard.  Next time someone comes up to you and goes, well, what I'm hearing is this, just look at  him and go, but who are you?  Who the fuck, yeah, who are you?  How do you know this stuff?  You're hearing it, are you?  We're all just speculating.  You think?  But I guess Leno's going to go to 1135 as we speculate now. 
[00:02:30]  Yes.  And then Conan's going to start at 1205.  And then what, poor Jimmy Fallon starts at 1 o'clock in the morning?  1 in the morning, 105 a.m.  That's what you're hearing?  That's what I am, that's what my sources are telling me.  Really?  Yes.  Well, all right.  I know.  And what does this mean for little Jimmy Norton?  I don't know.  I was thinking the same thing.  Jimmy can't catch a break.  It's like, he has momentum on that show.  But he has the worst luck. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Think about it.  Because he's the guy that, like, to me, you know, and I might be biased because, you  know, the guy is hysterical and he does this show and everything, but he's the funniest  motherfucker on that show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He does that.  Oh, absolutely.  I guess it's fucking brilliant.  The last one on Tiger Woods was amazing.  It's brilliant.  But Jimmy had Tough Crowd, which was rocking.  Yeah.  Taking them places.  And then that guy canceled.  Then he gets Lucky Louie, which is amazing that they canceled after one season because 
[00:03:30]  they just should not have done that.  No.  They canceled that just as Jimmy's hitting.  Now Jimmy's pretty much a regular on Jay Leno.  And now they're getting rid of the 10 o'clock show and moving Leno back to late night.  So what does that mean?  But only for a half hour.  So is that enough time to give Jimmy a spot?  What does it mean for you?  I'm thinking it is enough time to give Jimmy a spot.  I think it is, too.  But with a half hour show, that's a lot of spot for him.  God. 
[00:04:00]  What?  No.  A little conservative today.  Yeah.  Too brown.  Or black.  I'm colorblind.  What color is that?  Someone almost got a fucking text last night.  What?  I was contemplating, like, just goofing around.  I'm sitting there going, like, you know, I should just text something.  And then I'm like, nah, I won't fuck her up.  Believe it or not, this thing isn't over.  I know you haven't seen her in over a year. 
[00:04:30]  But I'll keep saying it.  You never had the breakup sex.  I'm like, dude, let me.  Because I'm on the couch.  I'm watching TV.  Texting.  A little twittering.  Shit like that.  And then I'm just like, ah.  Did you actually have a message typed out?  No, no.  It never got that far.  Or texted out.  It was a fleeting thought that quickly, you know.  You ever have a text all written out and then go, nah, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete. 
[00:05:00]  Get rid of it.  That's even better.  That's how you get rid of it.  You know what?  I think this is a perfect weekend for the breakup sex.  You think?  It's going to be, what, a horrible weekend.  Really cold.  Weather-wise in New York.  I'll light up a fire in the fireplace.  Yeah.  Wow.  Snow's coming down.  You're doing that breakup sex.  She leaves Sunday morning and you never talk to her again.  Perfect.  Perfect.  People on the feedback here in front of me. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Very smart ass-ish.  How close, though?  Not very close at all.  But it was a thought.  That's good.  It was just a fleeting thought.  And then as I glanced to my right and looked at the wine bottle, I thought better of making a text at that moment.  Oh, really?  I was kind of like, eh, I was kind of deep into a bottle.  So I was like, ah, don't be stupid.  You're crazy.  Why?  Did you do the whole bottle of wine?  Yeah, but it was between, let's see, I woke up at 5.30 p.m. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  And then I Twittered this, too.  I was like, did you ever have a commercial come on for intervention and have it remind you that you wanted a drink?  And that's exactly what happened.  Like, this commercial came on for intervention where the girl's crying, eh, my mother's an alcoholic.  And they show this woman, like, I just like the taste of wine.  And she's all hammered.  I'm like, hmm, wine.  I just go downstairs and pop a bottle and, you know, a little fire going. 
[00:06:30]  And then I realized, because we had the discussion yesterday with Patrice O'Neill here about our lonely little lives.  Right.  And we just go back to our lonely homes and lead our lonely lives.  I think me and Patrice were Twittering more than anybody last night.  And I just pictured us both sitting in our places alone.  Just tweeting.  Just tweeting.  Having a little wine.  I mean, the fire was going in my fireplace, but no one to share it with watching First 48. 
[00:07:00]  You did have the human contact with Twitter, though.  Yes, a little human contact with Twitter and online poker.  My point, though, is a whole bottle of wine.  You can handle a wine hangover?  But that's just it.  If you start early enough and then go like the entire one bottle of wine from 730 at night until 1230 a.m., like, that's nothing.  Man, that's, it's spanning over six hours.  But if you do, like, a dinner bottle by yourself?  If you do it, yeah. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, fuck.  No, you got it, you got it.  Not a fan of that hangover.  Stretch that out, you know what I mean?  Sure.  Jay Leno was goofing on the whole change that is in the air.  What does he know?  What does he know is right.  This is what he did last night.  Well, I just thought I'd be wishing happy birthday to Katie Kirk.  It's Katie Kirk's birthday today.  And, you know, she left NBC for another network.  I've got to give her a call, see how that's working out.  As you may have heard, there's a rumor floating around.  We were canceled. 
[00:08:00]  I heard it coming in this morning.  I heard it, too.  On the radio.  So far, nobody said anything to me.  But, Kev, you know, if we did get canceled, give us time to maybe do some traveling.  That would be wonderful.  In fact, I understand Fox is beautiful this time.  It really is.  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful this time.  Actually, I don't think there's any truth to the rumors.  See, it's all within my experience.  NBC only cancers you when you're in first place.  So we're fine. 
[00:08:30]  Hey, Kev.  What's up, Jay?  What does NBC stand for?  What's this?  Never believe your contract.  But you know.  Wow.  Like that.  Wow.  He don't give a shit.  No.  What does he care?  He doesn't care at all.  He's a commodity.  He knows it.  Especially in late night.  I think that was kind of a silly move.  Jesus Christ.  The guy was beating Letterman every night.  Yeah, I don't know what they were thinking.  The whole Conan thing. 
[00:09:00]  It just feels like Conan fell off the face of the map.  And they moved him up.  Yeah, and it feels like you're right.  Like he had more of a buzz and exposure when he was later.  He really feels like he went away, doesn't he?  It feels like, yeah, he got taken off the air.  That's what it feels like.  And it was supposed to be more exposure.  Yeah.  I just, I don't think, he's better in that later night slot.  Yeah.  And Leno was perfect on the Tonight Show. 
[00:09:30]  He was there since Carson left and he kicked ass for that many years  and then they decided to shake shit up.  Executives are stupid.  Executives blow.  They really just know how to screw the pooch every fucking time.  They blow.  Trust me, they blow.  All right.  All right.  Well, that's only Friday.  These are just pleasantries, Anthony.  Oh, pleasantries?  Don't worry.  All right.  I'm still in the pleasantries phase in the new year.  But man, do they blow.  They really do.  You fucking hire creative people that know what the fuck they're doing. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Just leave them alone.  Let them be.  Don't try to get involved.  Like, you're helping.  You're not helping.  Take a pencil and, like, look at stats.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at a graph.  Look at a pie chart.  Yeah, you're the pie chart guy.  Yeah.  But as far as creativity goes, you hire the creative people.  Leave them alone.  And if they're doing well, guess what?  Leave them alone.  No, they've got to shake it up.  There's got to be a guy with an idea.  There's a guy with an idea. 
[00:10:30]  And then everyone else, I think, rallies around idea guy.  Right.  Because they're like, he has an idea.  So if it fucks up, he gets fired and we're fine.  But it looks like there's a new idea.  Right.  So they're doing their job.  Right.  When these dummies see me in the hall.  Oh, Jesus.  Around here.  Pleasantries, Anthony.  Pleasantries.  Oh, oh.  Pleasantries.  Really?  We're live Friday.  Okay.  We're live on Fridays.  We're doing them a favor.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Right.  We do them a favor by working on Fridays. 
[00:11:00]  But when one of these dummies comes up to me in the hall and goes, hey, I got an idea.  I go, I look him right in the eye.  I go, who are you?  When did you?  I go, when did you ever do a radio show?  Oh.  Why don't you give me some tape of your radio show?  And then I'll decide if I'll listen to your idea.  You actually talk to them when they come up to me and go, I have an idea.  I put both fingers in my ears and go, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  I don't even want to hear an inkling of the word. 
[00:11:30]  You're going to give me an idea?  Yeah.  You've never had a radio show.  How about you just walk in there and go, I got an idea about finance.  No kidding.  No kidding.  And how to bring the stock price up.  And they'd be like, what do you know about it?  You're a radio personality.  Right.  If I want.  Don't tell me.  If I want, like, advice on how to dress like a douche, I'll come see you.  Holy.  Pleasantries, Anthony.  Pleasantries.  That's pleasantries. 
[00:12:00]  These are nothing but pleasantries.  Dress like a douche.  Then you know what?  Hey, I want to dress just like you.  Meaning a douche.  Where do you shop to get that douchey look of yours?  You know it's got to suck.  Doing that final little chika chika chika tug on the tie every morning.  Oh, my God.  When you're looking in the mirror and they do that little pull and then the knot, you hold  the knot and go chika chika chika.  Snug it up to your fucking Adam's apple.  Every morning.  Imagine that. 
[00:12:30]  Like, all right.  A wedding.  A funeral.  Whatever.  You do that.  Whatever.  Every fucking morning.  Could you imagine doing the chika chika chika?  I was working at CMF in Rochester with, you know, the great Brother Weez, right?  Of course.  And they didn't really have a full-time slot for me on the radio, so I was like the jack  of all trades.  I did a little part-time.  I did traffic reports for the afternoon girl.  I helped Brother Weez in the morning.  I did some production.  Traffic report?  You want to go out?  Uh, and I, and they got the idea that maybe I would become a, a good sales guy in radio. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  So for about a week.  No way.  I was kind of wearing.  You were her tarlick?  Yeah.  I was wearing a tie.  And Weez saw me and goes, you're, you're a fucking suit now?  I'm like, oh, no, no, no, I'm not.  But I was making like $8,000 a year, so I was trying to figure out how I was going to  like, you know, make my money.  And I, I'll, I never forgot that. 
[00:13:30]  He goes, never become a suit.  A suit.  Within the, he should have grabbed you by the tie and like pulled your face into his.  And they, you know, he used to sit with me and, and, and whatever, you know, the on-air  guys, we'd all sit together.  Yeah.  And just because I had a suit on, it was like, it was like a cafeteria thing.  I couldn't, I couldn't sit with them anymore.  You can't trust them.  So then I'm awkwardly sitting there in my, like, uncomfortable tie going, what the fuck  am I doing?  Good for him telling you that.  And within a day or two, the tie was gone and I never looked back. 
[00:14:00]  And that's what they are down the hall.  Suits.  Dressed douchey.  Just.  Well.  Well.  Am I right?  I'm not going to disagree with you.  Not on that one.  Okay.  Pleasantries.  Pleasantries.  These are all just pleasantries.  Pleasantries.  Uh, what else is going on, Ant?  Um, well, if you want to check, like I said, I was Twittering last night.  Um, the front page of Drudge Report.  Right.  Very sexy. 
[00:14:30]  Very risque.  Let's take a look at that.  Pop up, uh, the Drudge Report front page.  Yes.  Very sexy.  They, now, this is the full body scan that the airports are debating using.  Um, where, it's pretty much an x-ray of, it's, it's somebody without their clothes on.  Why does it say Big Sis wants to see under your clothes?  It's like a Big Brother thing.  No, I understand.  But she's like the head of the friggin', you know.  Oh, she is.  Okay, that's why.  Okay, I got you. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, it's like Big Sister.  You know what, though?  They could still say Big Brother because she looks like a dude.  I know.  She looks like a man.  Uh, but finally, uh, they release a picture that's not that fat plumber ass guy.  Sure.  That we always see when they show the, uh, the airport scanner pictures.  This is a hot chick.  Yeah, she's very sexy.  She's got a great body.  You could see the outline of where her jeans are and everything like that.  She's wearing a belt.  She has a nipple ring and a belly button ring.  Mm-hmm.  Now, you can't really tell that in that picture.  But, uh, somebody, so I, I Twittered that picture last night, uh, and said, uh, this debate 
[00:15:30]  is going on over whether to use this or not.  I go, does anyone just, why isn't anyone amazed that we figured out fucking x-ray vision?  We figured out x-ray vision.  No one's, no one's freaking out about the fact that we now have complete x-ray vision.  Oh, yeah.  Not an x-ray, you know, your arm or something like that.  Well, this is complete x-ray vision.  Well, the, the shot we're looking at, I mean, she's got a perfect body and you could see 
[00:16:00]  everything that would turn you on and, and you would jerk off to that picture.  Well, in a pinch, you would jerk off to that picture.  You would.  As a kid, I certainly would.  But then I'm alerted by a, uh, by some guy on, on Twitter.  He goes, hey, Anthony, run the picture through Photoshop and invert it.  Now, when you invert it, it makes the negative a positive.  You know, it just turns it around.  Is that an easy process for the regular Joe?  Three clicks in Photoshop.  Okay.  It's three clicks away.  I'm not a big Photoshop guy. 
[00:16:30]  And, uh, I did that and holy fuck.  That's what comes out?  What comes out is a picture, albeit a bit grainy, but it's that girl, nude, face is completely  recognizable.  Dude, don't misrepresent.  You can see the belly button ring, the, uh, nipple ring.  But don't misrepresent.  And pussy.  That's barely grainy.  That is.  Yeah, I know.  That is a photograph.  Yep.  You can see her belt.  Her buckle is very, um, that she's, dude, she's wearing clothes. 
[00:17:00]  So that picture originally, she had the jeans and everything on, like you were saying.  She's got clothes on.  What was she wearing on, uh, on top?  I don't know.  Some kind of, you could barely see that even in the, uh, uh, negative version, but you do  see that there is some kind of clothing that she's wearing on her left side.  You could kind of see something there, but when you, when you invert the image, that's  x-ray vision.  Sure.  That is a nude fucking girl.  Uh, you could see snatch.  You could see nice titties. 
[00:17:30]  Real nice titties.  And then someone said, everybody's going to have nice tits because you don't see the bra.  Right.  So the bra keeps it all holding the tits up and, and you don't see big, no sloppy tits  hanging down.  Uh, but this opens up all kinds of controversy.  Now they're saying with, uh, like child pornography.  Uh, if a kid goes through this, right.  You're literally taking nude pictures of children, um, uh, privacy issues again.  Now that face, when it's a negative, you can't really tell who that is. 
[00:18:00]  So maybe it looks a wacky, but then now when you'd look at the positive image, you would  know who that is.  If, if, you know, if it's a celebrity, maybe you go into the machine, but your head stays  out.  Yeah.  Perhaps.  So you're headless.  You're a hot chick that has no head.  But then what about the fucking, uh, scalp bomber?  What happens when scalp bomber hits?  Yeah.  Cause then that's, and now, you know, I mean, it's going to get to the point where they  need a full fucking naked x-ray of everybody.  Uh, now the privacy issue comes into play and now the, the old, all right. 
[00:18:30]  You ever hear the gynecologist going like, well, to me, it's just a job.  I look at snatches all day and stuff like that.  Which is just bullshit.  You think a TSA, a transit, uh, a fucking, uh, security agent is going to be able to sit  there completely objective and not when some fucking hot, big titted animal comes through  and go, dude, check this out.  Of course.  They're, they're the fucking like degenerates.  Of course. 
[00:19:00]  They're going to sit there and no one's going to fucking rattle a copy off, snap a quick  picture of the screen.  I mean, there's, you can't keep this shit private.  You gotta, you gotta get this on a website because.  I know.  Cause you'll fuck up everybody.  It's huge.  Yeah.  Cause I don't think anyone else is, uh, what'd you do to this picture?  Just inverted it.  Inverted.  In Photoshop.  And, and balance the levels a little bit, but.  Hey, you know what?  It's so easy to do.  Let's, let's get this, uh, to our palette.  Uh, what would Tyler Dern do? 
[00:19:30]  Do it up.  Uh, uh, to take, it's on my Twitter, the negative version and, uh, the, the inverted version.  www.tdd.com.  He's a, he's a good friend of the show.  He actually sent us Christmas gifts.  Yeah.  Listens every day.  I know.  Very good Christmas gifts too.  Johnny Walker blue.  Hell yeah.  Uh, a very much appreciated.  Hell yeah.  That went on the top shelf right next to my Louis tray.  Louis.  You still got your Louis tray.  Yeah.  It's on the top of the bar.  I got my Louis tray, but it was 110 degree heat.  So I'm, I'm hoping it's still good.  Oh, damn yo. 
[00:20:00]  We got Louis tray from, uh, Caroline's many, many years ago, many years ago, like 10, 12 years  ago.  Uh, no, we've got to send this to what would Tyler Durden do.com because it, it takes the  drudge report photo and, and shows you, like Anne said, with three easy clips, uh, clicks  in Photoshop that it turns into just a nude, uh, woman, a complete nude.  And this is on the front page of drudge right now.  Uh, full frontal nudity.  Right.  With again, just three clicks in Photoshop. 
[00:20:30]  You have a completely unbelievable naked girl.  Right.  Right there.  It's great.  I mean, in all fairness, they're also going to have to see big fat slobs naked too.  Yeah.  In that, uh, in that machine.  And that's something she's got to, you can't tell like in, in the negative picture that  she's got a belly button ring and a nipple ring, but, uh, in the, in the positive picture,  you could see that.  You could see her, her snatch.  Sure.  Let's go to Fred.  Fred from Brooklyn.  What's up, Freddie? 
[00:21:00]  Good morning, fellas.  Hey, Fred.  What's up, man?  If she had implants, would you see the bags?  I don't know.  It is looking for like chemicals, right?  That's the whole purpose of the thing?  Oh shit.  Tit bomber.  Tit bomber.  If it doesn't see implants, we are going to have tit bombers.  Oh boy.  Women tit bombers.  Now we're going to have to have guys that just feel up the chicks and, uh, feel for explosives  in their tits.  They'll always figure out some.  I'll be leaving now to apply for that job.  They'll always figure out some dumb loophole. 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  They always will.  I don't think that, uh, you would see anything below the skin, to tell you the truth.  I don't know.  Again, who the fuck am I?  Right.  But, uh, this looks very surface.  Couldn't they, I'm sorry.  Couldn't they implant something under their skin to explode then on a plane?  Exactly.  That's why we're going to have to go to the, uh, the, um, other version where you just  see the bones walking through, uh, like in Total Recall.  Total Recall.  There you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're heading that way though.  We really are.  And then there'll be a bone bomber. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  That has something implanted in their bones.  And we're just fucked.  Hey Fred.  Yo.  You came in third place last night.  Oh, damn.  Third?  She was loud though, wasn't she?  Yeah.  Could you resend that?  I'm going to, I'm going to retweet that.  Give you credit today.  He's got, he's got, well, how do you expect to win when a walrus is sucking his skin?  Right.  I mean, uh, did you see the video?  You did?  Dude.  Insane.  First of all, I was stunned at the size of walrus cod.  Oh shit.  It's giant. 
[00:22:30]  It's like a big fucking, uh, walking stick.  And then he holds it and just bobs up and down on his own wiener.  Oh my God.  It's amazing.  If you haven't seen it, I'm starting a goofy little thing called Tweet of the Day on my  Twitter, OP Radio.  And last night's winner was walrus sucks own dick.  Yeah.  Walrus.  But Fred from Brooklyn was in third place.  He has a video of, uh, uh, not a soccer mom, sorry, a hockey mom.  Hilarious.  Her son gets in a fight and this woman is screaming.  That motherfucker. 
[00:23:00]  I've heard that one.  Yep.  I always go for the audio more than the visual.  I'll resend it right now.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks, man.  Have a great weekend.  Walrus.  Fucking walrus sucking his dick.  And he goes down on that thing.  He's balls deep on himself.  Oh, and if you're going to suck your own dick, what are you going to fucking play around or  are you going to get in there?  And then he just drifts to the bottom of the big aquarium tank and hits his head.  The commentary is really funny.  The woman.  I wonder why he's doing that.  The guy is a complete fag, by the way.  He goes, I wonder why he's doing that.  And she doesn't even go because he can. 
[00:23:30]  And she's just, she's just really into it.  And then she starts laughing because the walrus is now trying to hide his big walrus cock from  her.  Yes.  Because, because he's ashamed.  And at the beginning, you hear kids are there and they go like, ew.  And then the parents, I guess, actually have the kids away from them.  When do you be the guy that goes to the kids, don't worry kids, someday that's not going  to be you.  Yeah.  You just wait a few years.  But he's still doing it.  Oh my God.  Is he yelling at the, to the mother walrus, I'm not giving, I'm just getting, linger longer? 
[00:24:00]  Someone tweeted that last night.  I really had a hard time.  He's having a hard time seeing this.  Oh my God.  Why would you have a hard time seeing a walrus suck his own dick?  It's hysterical.  She doesn't want to see it.  She's laughing her ass off.  Oh, he's like, make me alone.  I want my privacy.  Oh my God.  I don't care to get it.  She's pretty hot.  This is all right. 
[00:24:30]  Watch a walrus suck his dick.  Oh my God.  He's doing it in the, like, corner's place.  Oh my God.  Watch out with those tusks, too.  So no one sees him.  So no one sees him.  Okay.  I'm sucking my own dick, Tennessee.  Yeah, so you can find it on my Twitter, OP Radio.  But did you see the other one?  The eagle?  No.  Which one was that?  Dude, Danny, go back to mine for a sec.  Sorry.  It's the second thing down.  I don't even want to say what it is. 
[00:25:00]  Right there.  Yeah.  Just show Anthony this.  Don't read what, don't read the length.  No, no.  Watch this.  I'll just watch.  Eagle.  It's a goat on a ledge.  Holy shit.  Eagle picks him up.  Holy shit.  And drags him to his death.  Wow.  And drops him.  Watch.  Drop.  See you later.  See you later.  See you later.  Oh, ho, ho, ho. 
[00:25:30]  See you later.  Holy mother of Christ.  I had a look at that about five or six times because I was trying to figure out if it was  real or not.  Oh, that is.  Because I've never seen anything like that in my life.  And then I'm thinking, wait, maybe it's for some movie.  But it's definitely real.  And then that eagle goes back and just chews that thing up, I bet.  Yeah.  What a gimmick.  Yeah.  Just takes the fucking goat right off the ledge with one.  I don't think people understand how fucking big eagles are. 
[00:26:00]  They get big.  They are goddamn giant animals.  Are they dinosaurs?  Dinosaur's?  Yes.  They're dinosaurs.  Oh, that poor stupid goat.  And it just thuds.  Look at him.  It falls.  It falls.  Oh, does he fall?  Bam.  That's it.  Then you get the animal rights people.  They're tweeting me going, fuck you.  I'm like, I'm just.  Fuck you.  That's nature.  You got dumb.  Right.  I'm just retweeting a nature video.  Relax.  Oh, yeah.  You yell at the eagle for killing the friggin.  That's called nature.  Well, that's the beauty of Twitter. 
[00:26:30]  Ban.  Ban.  Wow.  Ban.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't need to put up with your shit.  Exactatickatackily.  So, all right.  So we got.  Wow, we got a lot going on.  You were.  You had.  That tweet you had was great.  That was a tweet.  We're going to send that to whatwithtyladurndu.com.  He'll go with that.  Yeah, that's a good one.  And that'll get the country talking because no one is taking that x-ray photo and doing  that simple thing you did to make it look like a fucking regular photograph. 
[00:27:00]  Easy, quick three clicks and you're done.  And also, I was Twittering during watching the first 48, which, of course, one of my favorite  shows.  There's a murder that happens and then they show the first 48 hours of the investigation.  And I started just not even realizing if I was watching the same episode over and over  until someone pointed out, you have to, you have to look at the, or listen to the nicknames  of the person, he goes, did you see the one where Jerry Curl killed Cookie Head? 
[00:27:30]  Like, all right.  And that's how you tell.  It's like, all right, look, Jerry Curl and Cookie Head.  That's this episode.  That's funny.  And now I realize that.  But just, wow, I wonder why that really hasn't come up more in news or blogs, websites, things  like that, where it really is just a cavalcade of black people killing each other.  That's what that show is. 
[00:28:00]  It's the first 48 hours of an investigation of black on black crime.  It's just drug dealers.  And last night there was a 15-year-old girl that was shot outside of a party that just  somebody looked at somebody wrong, smacked his head, and decided to come out with an  AK-47.  It's like, can you just relax for a fucking minute and take a breath and think about what  you're going to do?  That happened a lot in my hood.  Centiport, Long Island.  Yeah, Centiport, it was known for. 
[00:28:30]  I couldn't go to a party when I was 15 without the worry that bullets were going to come  flying through the windows.  So the second somebody gave me a bad look, I went to the car and got my chopper.  I got the chopper, I like to call it, and went out and started slinging lead.  Dude, speaking of guns, are you following this Gilbert Arenas thing at all?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's getting better and better.  It's hysterical.  He was mocking his teammate?  Did you read this today?  Apparently, some of it got heated when he insulted the size of his buddy's gun. 
[00:29:00]  He goes, look at that little shiny gun.  Look at that little shiny gun.  What the fuck's going on in the NBA, though?  They're all going to the games.  What's going on in the NBA?  Apparently, they're all arms going to the games.  I've noticed some changes over the years.  It's not the Larry Bird versus Magic Johnson thing anymore.  Now everyone's tatted up, tattoos all the way up their necks.  They're bringing guns to the locker room.  And the one guy pulls out a gun and puts one in the barrel.  Yeah, this is... 
[00:29:30]  And then Gilbert Arenas, he's like, please, look at that little shiny gun of yours and  starts laughing.  And then he pulls out, what, four?  Four guns.  Four guns and puts them down and goes, here, I'll make it easy for you to shoot me.  He goes, look, you want to shoot me?  I'll make it easy for you.  Right.  Gives him like a real gun.  And then he popped the frigging round in in the chamber.  Gilbert did?  Yeah, they both did at one point.  And then the other guy that was just totally humiliated starts singing as he has the gun.  Yeah, to defuse it, I guess they said. 
[00:30:00]  But, man, what is going on?  You've got to think that this type of thing...  Well, how can I say it?  You've got to think more NBA players are taking guns to the locker room.  Yeah, I think I heard a tease on the news about the Nets.  Well, it sounds like they don't really check that type of thing.  I heard a tease on the news.  It said, and so the Nets, some of them are going to, or the Nets are going to be banned 
[00:30:30]  from doing something on their flights.  We'll tell you.  I'm like, oh, great.  Now I don't know, but I'm assuming they're probably going to ban any firearms from any of  these guys.  As they're traveling?  As they're traveling.  Which amazes me.  No, it's gambling.  Oh, it's gambling?  Yeah, they're banning gambling on flights.  Why?  On flights?  Yeah.  How could you gamble on a flight?  All right.  You know what?  Oh, what do you mean?  Just shooting dice?  I'm thinking like online.  You know what, though?  Shooting dice in the back of the plane?  Yeah, pretty much.  Are they gambling on the fucking planes? 
[00:31:00]  Well, that's how this all got started.  Exactly.  Anthony, I played a little basketball in my day.  You're bored when you're traveling.  I mean, my traveling was dumb.  It was on a bus to Amityville or something, but these guys are traveling all the time.  Jesus Christ.  And so they're on no shit.  Amityville.  And there was a curfew when we used to play Amityville.  Curfew.  That's like taking that...  A curfew for the town.  That's like taking that turn off when you were on your way to Great Adventure to go to the other place. 
[00:31:30]  Remember?  The fork in the road?  You can either go to Great Adventure or the other attraction.  I'll leave it at that.  I'm sure it's a great joke, but I don't know the joke.  I know where you're going with it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to have to tell me during the break.  So these guys are flying, what, three days, whatever it is, a lot.  And so they pass the time.  They don't want to just sit there and watch dumb movies.  They're gambling and doing all sorts of stuff.  Yeah.  Passing the time by gambling.  Oh, right, right. 
[00:32:00]  That was the turn off.  There was a fork.  You could go on the roller coasters or you could see some sights.  Sorry.  Should have picked up on that one.  So now because one guy...  I hate this mentality in this country.  It happens everywhere.  One guy fucks up.  Yeah.  So no one is allowed to do that fuck up of a thing.  No, never.  What is that mentality?  It doesn't make sense.  The gambling that these guys are doing is passing the time,  keeping them relaxed. 
[00:32:30]  And they're enjoying themselves, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So one guy fucks up with his online poker and his poker playing in general.  So now no one should be able to do it.  They get up to like six grand, though, that they owe each other and shit like that.  Six grand?  It wasn't paying.  I think it was like $6,000.  What was it there?  $60,000.  Yeah, I think it was higher.  Are you kidding?  It was $60,000?  Yeah.  I was like $6,000 was a lot if you're just having to fucking get...  $60,000 they're fucking betting with each other?  Yeah, they're throwing some money around.  Holy shit.  So now the Nets...  Busted out the gat, yo. 
[00:33:00]  So let's slow down and follow the trail here.  So now the Nets, who never had a problem with their players gambling while they were traveling,  now they're not allowed to gamble because of this guy's fuck-up.  Right.  I hate that mentality.  Always have and always will.  Because some people can handle shit.  You know why...  Some people can't.  You know why there's no insertion policy at SiriusXM?  Because one dopey DJ fucked up because he's irresponsible. 
[00:33:30]  So we all have to suffer because of his dopiness?  Yep.  That's what happens.  But that's, you know...  It's a dumb mentality to follow.  I don't know how...  To follow.  I don't know how these guys, and who knows how many more, are traveling around the country  with pistols.  You're not allowed.  You can't do that.  You've got to think this isn't an isolated incident.  Yeah.  I'm assuming a lot more of these guys are packing heat. 
[00:34:00]  And, you know, you might be legal where you live, but then the second you leave, you've  got to start looking into some of the reciprocation rules that they have with firearms.  But they travel differently.  They're not going through anything.  Yeah, I know.  That's just it.  Where's your bag?  Oh, over there.  Okay.  Some dude throws all the bags on a plane pretty much.  And they go, right?  But the second you leave, you know, your estate, depending on where you're landing...  Yeah, but you're landing, and no one's checking you when you land, obviously. 
[00:34:30]  So...  If you've got to then use your gun for self-defense or something like that, you're going to get  busted and end up like a plexigo.  Who can't get his little work release.  Can't get a work release.  Why wouldn't they give him a work release?  I don't know.  Like, that seems a little odd.  Like, he doesn't seem like a risk.  How many months did he do already?  Yeah, he's been in there...  Two or three months already?  Yeah, a couple of months.  He's got two years, though?  Yeah, he doesn't seem like a flight risk.  He's not like one of these guys...  He fucked up.  Probably because it was high profile. 
[00:35:00]  So they probably want to have him sit in jail a little longer.  Set an example a little bit.  A little bit.  You've got to think they're going to allow the work release eventually.  They probably will make him do another two or three months and then do some kind of work  release.  That's my guess.  Pointy stick on the side of the road.  I miss seeing that.  Oh, fuck, man.  Hey, and speaking of airports, we're kind of zigging and zagging here, but you know the Newark  thing?  Yeah.  They got the video of the person that broke the security thing?  Yeah, went in through the outdoor.  Thank you.  The video...  This is enraging. 
[00:35:30]  There's a girl.  She goes like this.  I'm doing the come here to Anthony.  Come here to Anthony with the finger.  She does this to her boyfriend.  The boyfriend just lifts up the rope or whatever or the thing and ducks under and starts walking  with her toward her flight.  Yeah.  And that's why they shut down the airport for six plus hours.  What does he think it is?  1972?  Where you just walk your loved one to the gate?  Dude, that guy should be punished.  That's what they're saying.  More than Plaxico. 
[00:36:00]  They're saying...  That guy should be in jail.  They're absolutely saying that.  For what he did to all those people that day.  Closing down the entire airport for six hours?  You should be in jail.  Inconvenienced a fuckload of people and...  And just because his girlfriend went, come here.  So he ducks under the ropes and starts walking with her.  And the person on duty, what was she on a cell phone or something they're saying?  I didn't see that part of it.  Because now she's out of a job.  Good.  Good. 
[00:36:30]  Well, I have to...  Can you see her in the video?  I...  Can you see the security person in the video?  Because, boy, would I like to see that.  I will bet.  I will bet.  You want to bet?  All right.  We'll bet.  I'll write down my answer.  Okay.  I'll write down my answer.  It's going to be the same as you.  Is it?  Yes.  I'm not even going to write.  I'm not going to write.  I'll just write the first letter.  Jesus, yeah.  Okay.  Or, wait a minute.  No, don't write down.  I made a mistake. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, I know.  Jesus.  So she's distracted doing her cell phone thing or something.  Oh, I'm wrong, apparently.  What?  Yeah.  What was it?  A guy.  Was it a guy?  Yeah, I thought it was a woman.  I thought it was a woman, too.  A guy?  Oh, you didn't have to bring one.  The cell phone at Newark Liberty Airport was closed because of this.  A grainy surveillance video released Thursday shows a man sneaking under a security rope  and walking straight through a security checkpoint with a woman. 
[00:37:30]  The transportation security agent is nowhere in sight.  Yeah, we're...  It's, you know, a little scary, I suppose.  It's not a little scary.  The security breach on Sunday stranded thousands of travelers and delayed flights.  No terrorist would try that one.  In the wake of Christmas days, foiled bomb plant, this security slip disturbs travelers  at Newark.  It's just, it's upsetting.  It's upsetting that, you know, we're all trying to do the best we can.  Shut up.  Get out of my way.  Put your overhead in.  Shut up.  And then somebody that is responsible for...  You're in my way. 
[00:38:00]  Doesn't do their job.  I was a little taken by how easily someone could, you know, get through under the ropes.  Doreen Addy said Jeff is traveling for the first time.  Oh, you think the ropes are magical?  Hearing about the security slip makes the already worried mom even more nervous.  This has happened more than you realize.  You know, having a family member, a son leaving the country for their first time and having  it happen here and someone who would just be negligent in their job for a couple seconds. 
[00:38:30]  Is she high?  One little mishap like that could unfortunately lead to a tragedy.  Jeff, you don't have to be a douche like your mom.  You know you're going to be okay.  And that's all it took for the unidentified man to sneak into the secured area.  The man apparently left about 20 minutes after he entered the secure area.  No inconvenience for him.  20 minutes.  20 minutes.  No kidding.  This guy had to know that this could be a problem.  Of course.  The TSA agent has been put on administrative leave.  TSA takes full responsibility for the breach.  God. 
[00:39:00]  Enough with the full responsibility thing, too, by the way.  I'm tired of it.  Obama said full responsibility.  What does that mean?  Do we get to cane you in a public square?  What does that mean?  I take full responsibility.  The buck stops with me.  Does it?  All you have to do in this world is say, I take full responsibility, and then that's it.  No.  It should be you say, I take full responsibility, and then they go to the law book and go, okay,  what's the crime for full responsibility?  Oh, flogging.  Right.  Exactly.  And then I would accept when these people say, I take full responsibility. 
[00:39:30]  I'm so sick of hearing that one, too.  And then they got the head of Homeland Security there, skiing.  It's a clusterfuck.  I can't wait for the Republicans to get back in there so I could go see it.  It's both sides.  Same thing.  It really is.  Same thing.  Same crap, just different skin tones.  I'm just amazed in a year how much skin tones. 
[00:40:00]  You know, if you put Obama in Photoshop, within three clicks, I'll have a president I won't  mind.  Right.  There you go.  You just have to invert it, right?  No, just invert.  But you know what?  That guy that held up all those poor people for six plus hours?  Yeah.  That's a real crime.  That's fucking terrorism.  The Plexico thing, who gives a crap.  Didn't inconvenience that many people.  Gilbert Arenas, who gives a crap.  That guy.  I want to talk to that guy. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  He needs to be dealt with.  Absolutely.  He needs correcting.  Absolutely.  Arenas makes $150,000 a game.  So $60,000 isn't that much?  Really?  Really?  I'd do okay for myself.  I would love $60,000.  $60,000 is pretty nice.  $60,000 is nice for everybody listening.  $60,000.  $60,000.  It's nice for Donald Trump.  Yeah.  What do you got, Matt?  That's all you got on that? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  I got my bucket in.  Oh, fuck.  I didn't get my bucket in.  Oh, damn.  You got your bucket in?  Nah, I didn't get my bucket in.  All right.  Damn, man.  That's a good start.  What do we got today?  Mm-mm-mm.  Patrice coming back?  It's going to be a loony house in here, if I may say loony house.  Honestly, not too bad, because Gallagher comes in at nine.  Oh, he does?  Yeah, Gallagher's coming back at nine.  People still talking about his appearance a couple days ago.  Nine tonight?  Nine.  Oh, unfortunately, it's this morning. 
[00:41:30]  Why are you saying unfortunately?  I'm exhausted.  He's just going to...  But that's what I'm saying.  From nine to 1030, what are we going to do?  Oh, coast.  I'm going to put my feet up.  All right.  I'm psyched that Gallagher's coming up today.  Now, see?  I didn't look at it that way.  And Patrice O'Neal coming back at eight o'clock.  Oh, let's see that one.  Did everyone do their research on villains?  Oh, shit.  I didn't do my homework.  This is like real school.  It's getting like that.  I totally didn't do my homework.  It's getting like that.  Please do that.  I couldn't come up with another villain that really... 
[00:42:00]  No, the one from, like we said, I think one of the top ones, top three, at least, is the  guy from Schindler's List there.  I pardon you.  Yeah.  He was just fucking ruthless.  And Hannibal Lecter.  Yeah.  Number one.  Hannibal's pretty ruthless.  Is he really number one?  I don't know if he'd be number one.  Maybe other people did their research.  Wait till Patrice gets here, and then we'll discuss that and other things.  Yeah, he was Twittering last night about the game. 
[00:42:30]  The big game.  And then people go, why are you watching the game?  It's like, why are you watching college?  I've got to watch college.  I know it's a big thing.  I know it.  Believe me.  But for me, nah.  Oh, Alabama.  We had a Photoshop x-rayed girls.  Alabama man.  Oh, wow.  Alabama man.  Alabama beats Texas 37-21.  Bama.  So.  Did Forrest Gump run?  Was he the guy running for Bama?  I'll be honest.  He was playing for, right?  And Forrest Gump, he was playing for Alabama, I think. 
[00:43:00]  How weird is that?  You don't really give a shit about sports or college football, but you know that.  A tidbit.  That little tidbit.  I watched that movie a lot.  I didn't watch it, actually.  I have a tough time with college football.  I should get more involved with it, though.  You know, I am going to have to just crank up Photoshop a little more often.  Apparently, a lot of celebrity pictures are easily manipulated to see what's going on underneath  a little better than they show them.  You know when you can kind of see nip? 
[00:43:30]  Mm-hmm.  You can kind of see, you know, on those tight-fitting shirts and dresses?  You'd put that in Photoshop.  You'd manipulate levels a little bit, contrast, colors.  Are we looking at J-Lo's nips now?  Just like that?  You could pretty much get a nude version.  Right on.  That's pretty good.  Yeah!  It's pretty good!  When we get back, Larry King.  Wow.  Did he have a fuck-up?  Really?  Wow.  Larry?  Did he have a fuck-up?  But he never does. 
[00:44:00]  One of the best ones ever.  Stop it.  One of the best ones ever after the break.  And Jim Norton, we got a voicemail from Jimmy addressing the rumors about Leno.  Oh, wow.  We'll do that right after the break.  Now he's a guy in the know.  I was writing him.  Me?  I just talk out my ass.  We'll see what he has to say.  Jimmy's in the know.  And he's going to be at the Addison Improv all this weekend for everybody in the Dallas  area.  Yes.  Go see Jimmy.  Check out Jim Norton.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  La, la, la, la, la.  Open Anthony for a Friday. 
[00:44:30]  Hi.  Hey, let's get right into the Jim Norton voicemail.  So Jimmy's down there in Addison, Texas, Dallas area, playing the improv.  Down there all weekend long.  And of course, of course, he's a big part of the Jay Leno show.  And the rumors are flying.  They're everywhere.  What's going to happen?  Yes.  I think it's becoming pretty obvious that Leno's going back to 1135 after the Olympics,  by the way.  He's going to go on hiatus February 1st.  So we're going to get Jimmy back for a while. 
[00:45:00]  And then when he returns, he'll be on at 1135 to only 1205, it looks like.  And then you're hearing that Conan goes 1205 to like 1105, then Fallon at 105.  Fallon gets the real late night boot in the ass.  Because they've got to pay everybody.  And they're all talented guys.  Yeah.  I mean, we said it earlier that it seems like Conan kind of fell off the face of the map.  But the guy, you can't argue that he's a very talented guy. 
[00:45:30]  I enjoyed it.  And has had a lot of success over the years.  I enjoyed watching his show when it was on later at night.  A lot of people had the same argument with Letterman, though.  Like years ago, Letterman was doing the late night thing.  And then they finally moved him up.  And people were like, well, he kind of worked better late at night.  That quirky humor.  Because if you recall, he really had a quirky ass fucking show.  Now it's more a standard talk show. 
[00:46:00]  But he was weirder than Conan ever was.  It's kind of weird to say that.  Because I always felt like it was just Letterman.  And I guess I'd have to really think about it.  And we were a lot younger.  So when you're younger, quirky is normal.  Larry Bud Melman, when he used to bring him out and shit, that was just weirdness.  Quirky?  Yeah.  God, to me, I just thought that was normal.  Yeah, you just thought it was.  No, but that shows our age.  I think when you say quirky, quirky. 
[00:46:30]  Kirky.  Kirky.  Yes.  When you say, quirky is going to be in on Tuesday.  That's a quirky.  I can't wait to talk to Captain Kirky.  I know.  Might as well have fun with my faux pas.  All right, yeah.  But when you were growing up and you were watching, I don't know, Monty Python and all  that, that would be considered quirky, right?  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  But when you're watching it as a kid, it's just normal to you.  It's just what it is.  Yeah.  You look back, though, at Letterman.  And, I mean, look at, look at, he was a young man back then. 
[00:47:00]  Mm-hmm.  And Larry Bud Melman.  He would just do, like, skits and be involved in sketches and things.  Larry Bud Melman's been dead for years.  I know.  Well, Dave, where did he find this guy?  I don't know.  But that was, like, you know, that was kind of a Conan-ish thing where people were saying,  I don't think you'd be able to move him up.  He's a little too weird.  And he kind of got into that thing of doing a regular, you know, talk show. 
[00:47:30]  He gets people on, he interviews, and that's pretty much it.  But Conan hasn't kind of hit that yet.  So.  And I don't think they give people as much time anymore.  That's for sure.  I don't fucking know.  They used to give them years to fucking succeed, especially in late night.  It's like, all right, we'll just stick them there, pay them, and hope for the best.  Now they just, they'll pull you right off.  They won't even give you a year.  Well, it's the nervous executive.  Nervous Nellies.  Whatever.  Here's what Norton has to say about the whole thing. 
[00:48:00]  Norton?  He left a voicemail late last night.  Hey, it's Jim.  I'm getting a lot of emails from a lot of you asking about, obviously, the rumor on TMZ.  You know, is it true, is it not true?  And as far as the rumor, if it's the rumor about me going back to Cleveland, to the House of Blues, on February 26th, that is, in fact, true.  And I will have my tickets going on sale tomorrow morning, Friday, January 8th at 10 a.m. at LiveNation.com. 
[00:48:30]  I tend to sell out very quickly in Cleveland, which means it's going to probably go clean very quickly, as we say.  So get tickets early, and that's a big, exciting announcement that I have.  And I heard about Artie.  If it's true, if that's what happened, if Artie really did, you know, do that, I hope he's all right.  If anybody has been in contact with him, please pass on my, I almost said thoughts and prayers like Tony Danza.  I really am an asshole, but, you know, I hope he's okay.  Anyway, and right now I'm in fucking Dallas, and it's 30-something degrees, and people obviously ask me, I've got the Leno rumor. 
[00:49:00]  I've got a few emails, is it true?  To be very honest, I'm not at liberty to say.  I mean, I talked to Jay.  He called me this morning.  And to listen to messages from this person, press 1.  Fucking Jimmy.  He's a douche.  Jimmy's going to be all right.  Leno loves Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  So I think if Leno does only a half-hour show, I think Jimmy will be a part of that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's my gut feeling, anyway. 
[00:49:30]  Where's Sam?  The Larry King thing we've got to get into.  Yeah, I want to hear this, Larry King, because you selling it like you did before the break, Opie, that's a tall order.  This is...  The best Larry King.  I think this is the best fuck-up.  Wow.  You can't even name any of the old fuck-ups at this point, right, Ant?  How important is the board?  How important is the board is way up there.  That's up there because the skateboarder got it.  That started the whole, how important is the...  Right.  You know, so I thought that was, like, top-notch. 
[00:50:00]  That did set the benchmark.  It really did.  And actually set up the bit that we love.  Set up the whole, yeah, the whole bit.  We love when Larry King calls.  We love when Bob Kelly calls.  We love when Sharon Osbourne calls.  Yes.  We've got all the celebrities.  Sam, is this the biggest fuck-up yet?  I mean, this is more, much more of a fuck.  Like, that was just a stupid question.  Like, this is like a...  What are you talking about?  Wow, really?  Oh, good.  Like, how could... 
[00:50:30]  Douche chills involved?  I mean, douche chills.  Like, this is the type of thing where you would want to return your television set to the store.  Wow.  Because it's like, what?  This is a really bad one.  Okay, that's bad, then.  Like, you think, like, how could this even happen?  Like, it's not like...  Is it poorly researched?  It just doesn't make sense.  Is it as bad as...  I don't remember exactly how Larry put it.  Now, fuck.  What did he do with the groceries?  Oh, God.  Is that the line, or...  That was a good one.  Yeah, when the guy broke into the woman's car to, like, whatever, and then... 
[00:51:00]  To rape her.  To rape her.  You don't just say, to whatever her, Sam.  I didn't remember if it was a rape murder.  No, there was a horrific rape going on for hours in some kind of warehouse.  Because he was holding the groceries, Larry asked.  Right, what happened to the groceries?  That's...  She was just dumbfounded.  The groceries?  The groceries?  Who gives a shit?  I'm being pummeled over the head with a monkey wrench.  He's sticking things in my hiney.  Yeah.  You want to know what's going on with my groceries?  Bob.  But again, this is not... 
[00:51:30]  This is more of like a...  It's not even...  It doesn't...  It's insane that anybody would even think this.  Okay.  It's crazy talk.  He...  It's time for him to just step down.  It is.  Yes.  This is it.  This should be the final, like...  CNN should come to him and say, look, we have to let you go.  Please stop doing the show.  And I saw...  And you've suggested perhaps Anderson Pooper goes into that spot.  Well, Anderson Pooper is...  They're grooming the Anderson Pooper guy. 
[00:52:00]  Are they grooming him?  Because now...  He's everywhere.  The other day, I tune in...  Not a fan of the Pooper?  Anderson Pooper...  Anderson Pooper 360.  And he's doing an interview.  By the way, I wouldn't be calling Anderson Cooper Anderson Pooper.  Why?  Fucking guy has some guns.  He will kick your ass.  I bet he does.  And I bet he would.  Oh, I bet he would.  He was talking with...  I turned him on.  I turned on Anderson Pooper 360.  Yeah.  And I see...  He's interviewing an interior decorator. 
[00:52:30]  They're talking about flower arrangements.  And the guy he was talking to was on fire, flaming.  Really?  Just a...  Yes!  You need the proper window treatments.  It was...  And I'm going...  There's a lot of...  There's a lot of news going on these days.  A lot of big stories.  Why is Anderson Pooper talking with an interior decorator about floral arrangements and window treatments?  And bam! 
[00:53:00]  He lost me in two seconds.  I was...  I was out.  Oh, wow.  You think he's going to turn...  Turn?  No, well...  Oh, what?  Okay.  But turn the Larry King time slot into a...  Into some kind of fabulous show, I would say.  Oh, my God.  I think his show would be fabulous.  Does he talk straight?  Yeah, completely.  No, I mean, not actual...  Like, you know, like, can he relate to the straight audience? 
[00:53:30]  With Anderson Cooper.  I don't see why he wouldn't be able to, Opie.  What are you implying?  I'm just asking.  The window treatments, does he talk about like, you know...  No, it was kind of like I couldn't even get into it as far as thinking maybe I could,  you know...  Dude, Larry King...  ...laugh at this or something?  At this point...  Well, we watch because, you know, we know why we watch.  If you're a fan of the show, we all know why we watch.  It's awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah, Larry's...  We're watching someone lose their mind on television on a nightly basis, which is just 
[00:54:00]  amazing.  How...  You don't really get to see it.  It's like a reality show.  It's him.  He thinks he's doing a talk show.  It's actually a reality show of watching someone lose their mind.  I feel like it's the new Kids Say the Darnedest Things.  King Says the Darnedest Things.  Wow, that would be good.  All right.  Did you guys notice that I have a horrendous haircut?  Do you?  Yeah.  I think you look fine.  I didn't...  And it has...  And it's...  And it was...  It was a gay thing. 
[00:54:30]  What?  Yeah, don't worry.  Travis has that.  What happened was, I got into some, like...  In the middle of some, like...  Like, bitch fight, I guess, that was going on.  Not me...  At the salon?  Dude, I've been going to the same person to get my hair cut.  Yeah.  I've been very happy with how he has cut my hair.  A man?  He's a man, and he's...  But he's also...  Actually, he is a friend of mine now. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  After all these years.  But he wasn't available.  Oh, shit, yo.  So I went back to his old shop, because he moved from the place I used to go.  Yeah.  One of these things where you have a haircutter you like, and then they move on, so you follow  them, like, all right, I'll go to your new place.  So that's what I did.  So he wasn't available, so I go to his old place, and I casually mention who cuts my hair  now, and this guy obviously doesn't like him.  Well, why would he?  And used to be his boss, and is mad that he left this establishment. 
[00:55:30]  Wow.  Next thing you know, he's taking a scissor to my hair and taking it out of my head.  Yeah.  I'm like, what the fuck?  You dropped the wrong name.  I just got involved in some kind of, like, bitch fight.  You went in.  Why would you think, if it's his old place, that he left on good terms?  How?  You speculated.  Well.  You did a coin toss on your hair.  Well, I'm sitting there, and the guy's, you know, the stupid small talk that I could  give a shit about. 
[00:56:00]  Just cut my hair.  I know.  He's like, I said, I used to come here.  No, what happened?  Well, I haven't been here in a year or two.  Why?  Well, you know, I'm like, well, because the guy who used to cut my hair, he, you know,  he moved on, and I did the right thing, and I go to his new place.  Is there a big sign?  Bruce is back.  Something like that.  I used to hate those.  You drive past the salon, and it's like, oh, Bruce is back.  Who cares?  A little thinner, but he's back.  Oh, shit. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, damn.  Watch yourself with those scissors, pal.  Don't poke yourself.  Right.  And so I go, yeah, I haven't been here in a while, and blah, blah.  I used to cut my hair, and he used to manage this place.  And this guy goes, blah, blah.  Blah, blah didn't manage this place.  I was his boss.  He's getting all mad at me.  Oh, shit.  I go, well, and then he goes, did blah, blah tell you that?  I go, no, blah, blah didn't tell me that. 
[00:57:00]  That's what I assumed.  I don't like blah, blah.  And then he goes, you assumed wrong.  Now I'm in a fucking thing with this guy, and he's got scissors.  Next thing you know, he's just like, take this out of my hair.  Edward scissor-handing your hair?  I think I, yes!  His hair flying all over the place.  So I'm close to just shaving my head and starting over.  I think it's better than you think it is.  But it's that bitchy thing.  Yeah, yeah.  I got in the middle of some kind of bitch.  You got in the middle of two bitches.  Something was going on between those two, and I got right in the fucking middle of it. 
[00:57:30]  And all I wanted was a goddamn haircut for Christmas.  Maybe it wasn't just the boss employee thing, if you know what I mean.  A lot of times, sometimes things go a little awry.  Maybe a little scornage.  Who the fuck knows?  But what does bitch fighting like that have to do with Anderson Cooper?  Well, because he's a bitch.  Oh!  Okay, thanks for clearing that up.  See, this is how easy this show is.  Anderson Cooper bitch, and then you go, oh my god, yeah, the bitch thing I was in around Christmas. 
[00:58:00]  Bitch haircut thing.  And you do a little off-roading, then you get back on the road, and you say, all right,  enough with this Anderson Cooper thing, and you get to Larry King.  Right.  You want the Larry King clip now?  I'm dying to hear it.  Please.  Yeah, I mean, you don't notice that, like, this piece is supposed to be a lot longer.  Is it?  I did say, but I thought, yeah.  I didn't even notice.  Well, because we're guys.  I know, that's just it.  I knew I had to, like, point it out so the story would make sense.  And then the sides are a little too poopy.  Oh, my God. 
[00:58:30]  Ah, shit.  Why do you think I started coming to work with a hat on?  I noticed that yesterday.  I haven't worn a hat in weeks.  You popped a hat on your head.  Weeks, I haven't worn a hat in months.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Yeah, this is supposed to...  This is supposed to be walking down the hall and just see some guy with a hat.  This piece is supposed to grow a little longer to cover up the fact that it might be fading  a little bit on the sides.  What?  But he just snipped that away.  He didn't give a shit about that.  He could give a shit.  He's like, oh, you went to blah, blah.  Did you?  Dude, he's all snip. 
[00:59:00]  He's all pissed off.  I'm like, dude, I just met you.  Yeah.  Don't put me in the middle of your bitch fight.  The gays are exhausting.  They are so full of energy.  They're exhausting, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  There's always drama with gays.  The gays are exhausting.  The gay always has drama.  There's something always going on.  And you don't even know when you're going to step in the middle of this.  Exhausting.  You're right.  You don't want to step in the middle of it.  All right, let's get to Larry King. 
[00:59:30]  Please.  Larry King asks Deborah Tate.  You know who Deborah Tate is?  Why was she on Larry King?  Larry Tate's daughter.  They were doing a Roman.  Whoa, hold on, folks.  I actually had an image of Jimmy's face in my head.  You know what, though?  And what he would have done.  How he would have looked at me.  No, I would defend that.  That's some TV knowledge right there.  I would defend you on TV knowledge every time.  Sharon Tate's sister.  Oh.  What, she got a book or something?  They were doing a thing about Roman Polanski and said they were getting people. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, no.  No, no.  Okay.  I'm not going to say a word, but I am conjuring up a horrible, horrible thing he could have done.  No.  They were doing like a Roman Polanski, so they had a few people who related to Roman Polanski on the show.  Hold on.  I got to go.  I got to go to Stony Brook.  Oh, no.  We're still off-roading, Sam.  I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  No, it's okay.  Stony Brook, what do you got?  Hey, what's up, boys? 
[01:00:30]  How are we doing?  Pretty good.  Good, good.  New barbershop opens up next door to me.  I go in there for a haircut.  Sit down.  The guy who's cutting my hair gets in a fight with somebody else in there, and he starts taking it out of my head.  Another barber storms out of the place.  I'm sitting there just getting my hair cut.  There's nothing I can do because the guy's got scissors.  So I'm left with this, and like you, I'm wearing a hat also.  Okay, Sam.  Yeah, now I got to cut.  I was trying to grow my hair just a little bit.  Now I got to cut it all off again.  You guys got to just stop getting haircuts altogether. 
[01:01:00]  Dude.  Let your freak flag fly, man.  I'm on to something, though.  All of a sudden, you get into a situation.  I'm like, I don't want to be in a situation.  I just want a haircut.  Oh, the gays.  So I look good for the in-laws.  Drama.  When I went down there for Christmas.  No more gay barbers.  No.  Where have you been?  I haven't gotten a haircut.  They get the best haircuts.  I guess.  I don't know.  You got to deal with the gays if you want a nice haircut.  I always went to an Italian barber.  Dude, the hot or the woman?  Oh, really?  Like the old school fucking, the little swirly Poland front? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Instead of the Poland.  You should go to a black barbershop.  Oh, damn, yo.  They don't have any gay black barbers.  And you will hear some stories.  Yeah.  I don't want graffiti in the side of my head.  I don't want graffiti.  Fucking go to the barber shop, yo.  I don't want to go to the barber shop.  There's a barber shop in my town called Macadocious.  Yeah?  I seem to get my neck cleaned up at Macadocious.  Getting your neck cleaned up a little bit.  You know what?  Next!  You done! 
[01:02:00]  Next time Nicole from the morning mashup walks by, have her come in here.  She'll notice how bad this hair is.  Okay.  Yeah?  She'll notice.  You'll have to say something.  She won't say.  And I'll have a new haircut when I meet everybody at the Brigada when Jimmy's down there next  weekend.  I will be all short hair.  How quick does that grow in?  I got to go short.  Wow.  I got to take it all off.  Hoorah.  And look.  I mean, Ant, who cuts your hair?  I go to John Sahab.  Is it a dude?  No. 
[01:02:30]  It's a Japanese girl.  Oh, see, that's throwing a curveball.  Yeah?  Because when you walk into a place to get your hair cut, you know what's going on.  If you've got that hot girl with the big tits, you're going to have a nice hour, but you're  going to have a horrible haircut in most cases.  She's been cutting my hair for a long time.  But Japanese, they take their jobs pretty seriously.  She does.  Oh, she does.  And then it's always a girl that shampoos my hair.  Once it wasn't.  Once. 
[01:03:00]  And I've been going there for forever.  So, and I like, I do not enjoy the guy shampoo.  I don't want the guy shampooing my hair.  When it's like, that one time, a guy comes over and he's like, all right, come with me.  I'm going to shampoo your hair.  I'm like, oh no, oh no.  And you can't say, hey dude, you know, nothing against you and everything.  But that massaging of the scalp thing, like.  I can almost deal with getting my hair. 
[01:03:30]  Like if it's the army and some guy's just like, okay, next, next, next.  Right, right, right.  But like, when they start massaging behind your ears and the back of your neck and it's  a guy, a little too touchy-feely with a man.  Dude, I don't need that.  I was going to a pretty nice place on Columbus Avenue and this like older Italian broad,  but she still had it together.  She did the shampoo and then she did that massage where your whole body starts tingling.  And she's only messing, like you said, with under the ears and the back of the neck. 
[01:04:00]  It's great.  And the scalp.  I was so like, what the fuck?  And then I turn around, she actually winked at me like, if you like that.  Well.  And I'm single too.  I should have taken her up on it to see what the fuck the wink was all about.  Must have been before that haircut.  No, this goes back, but she, I mean, just that, she was like advertising.  Like, this is, I only do this during the day. 
[01:04:30]  If you want to see what I could really do.  Yeah, below the neck, right?  Because something was going on.  Because I was like, that's more than just a nice little, like, I'm going to get you  relaxed for your haircut, neck massage.  Pretty good at that shit, huh?  I was like, what the fuck?  Goddamn.  Let's go to Jim in Connecticut.  Jim.  Jim.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  I got a quick story.  A couple years ago, I went to get a haircut at the local barbershop by the side of town.  And as the guy's cutting my hair, he's right in the middle of cutting my hair, he starts  telling me how he, all his friends come over. 
[01:05:00]  I'm like, yeah, okay.  He goes, you want to be my friend?  I'm like, uh, it's my first time here, but okay.  He goes, well, if I offered you a blowjob, would you ever come back again?  Now, he's right in the middle of cutting my hair.  I'm not going to say no.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, uh, yeah, I'll come back again.  No problem.  You know what?  God, I suck your cock.  You know what, Jim?  I'm kind of with you because we all care a lot about our hair.  You don't want that.  We make believe we don't, but we do. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  You don't want the guy fucking having your hair be saying no to that question.  I don't want, I don't want to be good.  So you kind of got to lead him on until the hair he's done.  Oops.  Snip.  Fucking.  Just chunk taken out.  He wasn't even a good looking gay.  You know, most gays are good looking.  He was like this old, white, hairy guy.  He's upset because his barber wasn't cute enough.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry that your gay wasn't cute enough for you.  You're gay.  You're gay.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Thanks.  What do you do in that situation?  I guess you got to kind of play the game and lead him on a little bit so you get the nice haircut. 
[01:06:00]  Now you're pulling a boss with his drug dealer, though, you know?  Just enough to get what I need.  All right.  Ban that.  What happened?  I need to ban that.  Tying up all the fucking feedback.  What is this?  It's just some guy from his mobile phone, I guess.  Oh, and his phone number's right there?  That's great.  Do it up, Dan.  Do your magic.  Yeah, it's been up.  It's been working. 
[01:06:30]  Well, I paid the bill.  Oh.  That's an update.  Feedback bill.  I mean, me and Ann paid the bill.  It's ridiculous.  Ann's signing checks.  I'm signing checks.  We got, like, a joint account.  Like, Ann and I are kind of, like, married, I guess.  Oh.  Without the benefits, Sam.  Oh.  And so he's fucking writing checks for shit I don't know about.  I'm writing checks for shit he don't know about.  My mouth's writing checks that my body can't cash.  And to the guy that just, to the guy that is saying, see, on the instant feedback, you're not a fan of the show. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, call him.  Yeah, give him a call.  Give him a call.  I'm done with all that bullshit.  Every phone line is ringing.  And so you're in the minority, my friend.  Call him.  Yeah, we'll get him on.  Get him on.  Get him on.  Well, we'll have a little chit-chat.  Let's go to Dan in Pittsburgh.  Dan.  Dan.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to give you a quick story here.  A couple of, well, a while ago before the hair started falling out.  Went to just a normal salon and was talking to the girl. 
[01:07:30]  And she went to the same high school as my wife.  And I was just like, oh, yeah, my wife went there.  And she goes, what's her name?  Gave her the name.  And she goes, oh, yeah, she used to beat me up all the time.  And sitting there at the mercy of the scissors, worst haircut ever.  Yeah, that's why it's probably better you don't say anything.  Don't say a word.  Because, I mean, all of a sudden, it could be as easy as, like, hey, you see Obama's speech last night.  And I'll play the part of hating Obama, I guess. 
[01:08:00]  And I'll go, ah, yeah, that's fucking blah, blah, blah, blah.  And all of a sudden, this guy's a huge Obama fucking guy.  But you think he's going to, like, take his time with your hair?  Yeah, now.  Or is he going to take it out on you a little bit?  Yeah, they can't just keep their emotions at bay while they're cutting your hair.  After you just trash the guy he likes.  Yeah.  That's why.  I don't even think my hair cutter understands much English.  No.  To tell you the truth.  That's good.  She's Japanese.  She's just like, you know, how are you? 
[01:08:30]  I go, good.  And then, oh, good.  Same as a, same?  You want same?  Washi-washi?  I'm like, yes.  Sucky-sucky.  No Yankee-cranky.  Let's go to Charlie in Philly, who has a great observation.  Charlie?  Morning, bu-bu-buy.  Hey, Charlie.  Hey, you can't pass over Jim's phone call like that.  The old barber offered him a blowjob.  How was the blowjob?  Yeah, well, that's true.  Did he go back? 
[01:09:00]  Did he get the blowjob?  I think we were just creeped out by his story and wanted to move on.  Did he just sit in the seat going,  Yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep, yeep?  Thank you, Charlie.  Hey, Siegfried from Oregon.  Siegfried?  How's Roy?  Hi.  Oh, yeah, I never heard that one.  Christ.  I had to do it.  I had to do it.  I know.  So I got this poof, and he's like, I'm getting a haircut,  and he's kind of rubbing himself on you, like the crotch. 
[01:09:30]  You know, it's right where the arm is.  Ah, yeah.  So it's very uncomfortable.  And then he is carving the back of my head, you know,  like just shaving it with kind of like a whatever, the buzzer thing, whatever it is.  And he messes up and carves into my head, and then he starts crying,  and he puts his hand on my shoulder and then cries for the next minute. 
[01:10:00]  While my eyes are blinking, I have no idea what to do.  And then what's really bad is he goes, oh, I'll give the haircut for free.  And then while I'm like, okay, that's cool.  Well, thanks.  I have to go to another hair cutter because it's totally fucked.  He asked for a tip.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Well, that's why when you do find somebody, you follow that person. 
[01:10:30]  Did he say a tip or the tip?  Yeah.  Because it's very stressful when you go into, like, a brand-new place to get a haircut.  It really is.  And I'm truly traumatized.  My brother, his ear was cut off by my mom, like, giving a haircut when he was a little kid.  And so I was like, talking to my brother.  My mom got some nice new scissors and sniffed, just took off the top of the ear of my brother.  Wow.  And traumatized ever since.  Very good, brother. 
[01:11:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, that's another thing about a guy cutting your hair.  Like this guy said, you got the armrests and your shoulder and stuff.  You can't contain yourself in the seat completely.  And sometimes they, barbers, stylists, whatever the fuck you want to call them, they do that thing where they lean back with their torso.  Yeah.  But their groin is still, like, pushing against you.  Like, what the fuck are you doing?  You got to, like, they got to look a little further back so they do this thing. 
[01:11:30]  And their cock is touching you.  I don't need that.  That's why I'd rather have a vagina near me when I'm getting my hair cut.  Nice.  Let's say hi to, uh, there's a lot of good ones coming in.  Someone wants to know if it moved when the guy shampooed your hair.  Did it move?  Did it move?  I think it moved.  It moved a little bit.  I think it moved.  Uh, then we got Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Jared.  Hey, buddy.  Uh, when I was, like, 16, 17, I used to go to this one place. 
[01:12:00]  I think I got Super Cups, you know, this shitty little place, right?  But, uh, they had...  Really?  Subway sandwich guy?  Yeah, I never heard that.  Anyway.  So I go to the Super Cups, they had a big tit monster, and, uh...  Let's see how far...  Every once in a while, I get her, and one time, she dropped the, uh, comb, bent down to pick  it up, and one of her tits just fell right out.  It was great.  Yeah, that shit is, uh, going on on purpose.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:12:30]  What else?  They don't have anything to lose.  No.  If they know if a tit falls out, it's gonna get a bigger tit...  Bigger tit.  Tip.  Tip.  Tip.  They're gonna let the tit fall out.  Yes.  Bug!  Sam, you ever have a tit fall out while you're getting your hair cut?  No, I always went to men.  Italian.  But it wasn't like a stylist.  You go to the barber shop.  It was a barber shop.  The barber shop, yeah.  You're missing out, man.  Where they have the, uh, the combs and the blue fluid.  Oh.  But that's old school.  It's like $13 for a haircut.  I'm not going to a stylist.  Another good question for Anthony coming in. 
[01:13:00]  Yes.  It's Dan from Cleveland.  Dan the man.  Hey, Dan the man!  Hi, guys.  Hey, Ant, do, uh...  Can't keep the bit going?  We just can't do it right there.  You think the listener would actually be able to catch the joke and keep the bit going  Like, we do our part and then you go, yeah, I haven't heard that before.  Yeah, yeah.  But no, not Dan.  I don't know.  Dan the man couldn't quite follow through three in a row.  Fuck, man, genie!  Now, go ahead, Dan.  I'm just wondering if Ant's haircut these days consists of reseeding and fertilizer. 
[01:13:30]  No!  It's not a lawn doctor, you dummy!  That would be hilarious.  No?  Very good.  You didn't even get the Dan the man fucking response line.  Here's a question.  Well, now we're going to give advice.  Dr. X is on the phone.  Dr. X.  Got one for Dr. X?  How you doing, boys?  Not really.  Here's the situation.  I go to this real old school guy.  He guy's probably about 60.  Cuts hair.  Great.  Gives a badass back rub.  Pops your knuckles and your fingers on your hand. 
[01:14:00]  You know, rubs your arms out a little bit.  Massages him.  What the fuck are you doing?  What the fuck are you doing?  Hold on, Sam.  You don't understand.  The haircut has really evolved into a lot of things going on.  I don't understand.  What's he talking about?  Cracking your knuckles?  I went to another place where they gave you a hand massage.  Why?  Which felt great.  But you're getting a haircut.  Yeah.  They massage your upper shoulders and your scalp and your neck.  And then they massage your hands a little bit. 
[01:14:30]  And then they go, would you like a cup of coffee?  What?  As I show you to the station.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's so nice.  I get offered that.  I go, got some club soda with a little lime.  Twist the lime.  And they're like, certainly.  And then they bring that over.  They go, can I get you something else?  You guys get fancy haircuts.  This is old school.  Wonderful.  Yeah, go ahead, Dr. X.  So you're getting the blowjob from the guy.  And what happened?  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you how old school this is.  You're just done it, Anthony, because you're around.  They have that old steamy thing where they pull out the towel and put it on Elmer Fudd's face. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, right.  That's how old school this joint is.  And they got the old 1950s pictures on the wall.  You said, give me the number one, the number two.  Oh, right, right.  The old haircuts on the wall.  He does the nut rub.  I've got to go back to this guy.  I put my shoulders in.  I put my hands to the side.  And I still get the nut rub.  Wait, how does he...  You can't get in the seat enough.  And he's still able to rub his nuts on you?  You're closing yourself like an accordion.  And he's still finding the nuts.  How does he rub your nuts, though?  Well, you know, his nuts.  Not mine. 
[01:15:30]  Rubbing his nuts on you.  Yes, that's what we mean.  Oh, he rub...  Oh, so what?  Okay, okay.  I got it.  No, he goes over and starts rubbing the guy's balls.  I thought that was part of it.  The knuckle cracking.  I got to raise his knee up between his legs.  So whatever part is exposed, he's rubbing his nuts on?  Yeah, but as a dentist, I do the same thing to the motherfucker when he gets into my chair.  I do the old little...  That's true.  Dentist is another one.  The problem is he doesn't take his hand away.  So what do you do?  Anytime you're involved with a chair where you've got to sit in a chair to do something 
[01:16:00]  and somebody's, you know, working on you for something, the nuts are going to be there.  They're right there.  That's what they're putting in the front.  My Wall Street brother, who's, what was I going to say?  My Wall Street brother.  That's what I was going to say.  He's a fan of the shave.  He's trying to talk me into going for a shave.  And I'm like, a shave?  I could do that at home.  He goes, you don't understand, man. 
[01:16:30]  You don't understand.  He loves it.  I guess it's old school with the fucking, you know, the fucking blades.  Yeah, the thing sharpens it on the leather strap.  And hot towels and foam.  What is the 1850?  And I think there are women in the shop that give you the little massage on the shoulders as well.  And he says it's the greatest thing.  It's the greatest half hour.  He loves going to get a shave.  What the fuck is this?  This is a video I saw a while ago. 
[01:17:00]  There's some barber somewhere, an African-American gentleman,  and he cuts other African-American gentlemen's hair using fire.  He basically burns the hair off.  He's using two of those big matches you use to light your fireplace.  And he's running it along the guy's hair.  And it's smoking.  And then he rubs it.  It rubs the fire off.  That place must stank.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Burning hair is not known to be a nice fragrance.  I mean, those places smell to begin with. 
[01:17:30]  And then you get the fucking hair burning.  Holy shit.  What places?  Barbershop.  Just barbershop.  And they smell like that with chemicals and that blue fluid.  Yeah, where's your mind at, Sam?  What's wrong with that, Sam?  Oh, come on.  Relax.  Just wondering.  Wow, that can't be real.  What the fuck?  It's just a gimmick to get on TV.  Everyone has their gimmick to get on TV.  I don't think that's strictly African-American because your hair kind of...  You ever burn your hair?  It kind of curls up like that? 
[01:18:00]  Well, you...  I mean, it's on the run.  It kind of looks like you.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, I was just telling my dumb story, but the phone's still on this topic.  People love haircuts.  All right, let's do a few more then.  We're going to get to the Larry King call in a second here.  Jim in Los Angeles.  Jim.  Hey.  Hey, Jim.  What's happening, boys?  He's dead, Jim.  He's dead, Jim.  What's up, swim Jim?  He's dead, Jim.  He's dead, Jim.  What's the slug?  Nobody.  Jesus.  You would think this guy would learn from what we said about the other guy, but no. 
[01:18:30]  What's up, Jim?  What's happening?  I'm stupid.  Anyway.  I got a main guy who's great.  He gives you the best haircuts.  He told me once he's Guatemalan.  We're talking about where he's from, whatever he's Guatemalan.  I go in one day, and we're talking about stuff, and I'm like, hey, you're Venezuelan, right?  Oh, boy.  That was a mistake.  Apparently, the Guatemalans hate the Venezuelans and vice versa, and that worst haircut ever.  You're supposed to know, like, political, world politics. 
[01:19:00]  But that's all it takes.  Uh, so you don't get a fucked up haircut.  It doesn't matter.  Los Angeles, it's impossible.  You can't refer to anybody as Mexican, because none of them are Mexican.  They're all from Colombia, Guatemala, wherever the hell.  They don't like being called Mexicans, yeah.  Yeah.  I hear you.  I hear you.  Because they're not from Mexico.  Is that why?  Yeah, I mean, same reason I don't like being called German.  I'm not from Germany, you know?  I wouldn't mind that.  Yeah, because you're black, so you said it.  Let's say hi to George.  Hey, boys.  How's it going? 
[01:19:30]  Are you in the jungle, George?  George, which way did he go, George?  Which way did he go, George?  All right.  Let's say Roll Tide one time.  Hey, uh, did you watch the big game, George?  I got to listen to Paul.  I watched half of it.  I was working third shift.  George, George, George of the jungle.  I've never heard that.  But anyway, I...  You got to sing it.  Oh.  I wasn't sure if you were listening or you...  No, I heard you do it, but I figured if I sang it, he might catch on. 
[01:20:00]  All right, gotcha.  Anyway, I went in this little barbershop, first time ever.  First clue should have been there was no cars there.  I go in, and the guy's about 80 years old.  He's an old veteran.  And I served in the military, so we're talking about it.  Well, he pulls out the clippers, and he's got to hold his right hand with his left hand.  He's shaking so bad.  Wow.  Parkinson's?  He's a nice guy, but he's just skinning my head up.  I know he is.  I can't see it.  Jesus.  And then he pulls out a straight razor. 
[01:20:30]  He wants to shave my neck and my ears.  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.  We'll skip that.  Well, he holds the mirror up, and I must look like a rape victim, because my head is skinned.  He looked like a dog with mange.  I mean, it was pitiful.  How can I see a barber?  A barber.  Hey, guys, love the show.  Thank you.  Hey, George, I appreciate it.  You know, that's where I'm tormented, because a lot of people call me the destroyer, but  if I went in and the barber had Parkinson's, I would sit through a Parkinson's haircut. 
[01:21:00]  You would think that would be easy for me to go, you stupid, shaking mess.  No way.  I'm going somewhere else.  You see, sometimes when they do that detail work around your ears with the tip of the scissors,  I would have to stay.  That's where I'm tormented.  That's why it just doesn't make fucking sense.  Let's go to Joe in Queens.  Joe, Joe.  Yeah, what else?  Smokin' Joe!  What do you know, Joe?  Oh, not much, buddy.  Jesus.  Anyway.  Holy shit. 
[01:21:30]  So when I was like 13, 14, there's a Russian joint by my house that used to go in and you  pay for a ham and cheese, they'd bring you in the back for a handjob.  If you ask for a turkey sandwich, they'd give you a blowjob.  Wait.  Wait, you would go to a barbershop and they would give handjobs?  Handjobs, a code for handjobs?  Yeah, the Russian chicks.  Oh, Russian chicks.  So you'd say you want a ham and cheese sandwich and they'd give you a handjob?  Yeah.  What if you want a ham and cheese sandwich? 
[01:22:00]  What if you just want a ham and cheese sandwich?  You're hungry.  Yeah, they took a giant pitch, too.  And then the guy that worked there, he would, I'd get in the chair and he'd go, what's up,  man?  You want to smoke a little wheat tonight?  You bang some bitches?  I was like fucking 14 years old.  I was like, nah, man.  I go to a Spanish place now and you guys were talking about the shave before?  Yeah.  And they offer the shave, right?  It's like, yeah, get the fuck out of here.  I want no HIV.  Believe it.  I'm like, my neck.  Jesus.  Wow.  There's a lot of accusations being made. 
[01:22:30]  A lot.  They're probably disenfranchised.  Russian bras will jerk you off like it's nothing.  Oh, the drop of a hat.  It means nothing to them.  To them, it's like they're doing their banking.  They don't give a shit.  Nothing.  Nothing for us.  All right.  It's fun to make up and shit, but anyway, see you later.  All right, let's go to Scott.  Hi, Scotty.  Great Scott.  Hey.  Hi, Scott.  What's going on?  Not strong ones anyway. 
[01:23:00]  That was kind of hard with that.  We were trying, though.  Go ahead, Scott.  I'm surprised you didn't go with that.  Beam me up, Scotty.  Oh, yeah.  What's wrong with us?  I said that, man.  Fuck.  I was waiting.  At least you're on to the bit.  Say, we fucked up.  At least this guy's on to the bit.  We fucked up.  We fucked up.  I can call back if you'd like.  No, that's okay.  All right, all right.  I eventually want to get to that Larry King.  Oh, yeah, right.  Go ahead, Scott.  They actually don't burn the hair to cut it.  They're actually burning the hair to remove all the bugs that are infested in their head. 
[01:23:30]  That's ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  Let's see.  Sam, you want to defend your race?  Well, first of all, I'm not technically black.  That's just wrong.  But second of all, I can't sit here.  I'm depressed.  There's no bugs in those people.  I can't believe we would go to that phone call like that.  That's not nice.  I know.  I just can't sit here and listen to intolerance like that.  And blatant racism.  I can't sit here.  Thank you.  I will. 
[01:24:00]  Well, you have to.  I have to.  It's my job.  I would walk out normally on our listeners just because of that one gentleman's call.  Thank you for taking a stand.  All right.  Do you want a seat?  The phone's, Ant, they're still at it.  Do you want to make a pact?  We'll do two more, and then we'll do Larry King.  Okay, yes.  All right.  We got Kevin in Virginia.  Kevin.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I'm paying attention.  I just got Frank's place.  He's an old Italian guy from Manhattan.  Two and a half years getting my hair cut. 
[01:24:30]  Always the same.  I go in one day.  He takes out the straight razor, or the clipper to get closer to the skin, and just zips right  up the top of my head out of the blue.  What?  How did that happen?  What?  Was he trying?  What did he do?  He cut my hair the wrong way.  Oh.  Were you angry?  I was pissed.  Who is this? 
[01:25:00]  I don't need to talk to you.  Now, is it true that you got to pay double because progeria kids have giant heads?  Yes.  That is true.  All right.  So he lost it.  This guy had the greatest barbershop on our show.  There was Playboy magazines on the counters, and he let no woman in the shop.  Not even to use a bathroom.  That's good.  That's fucking, that's like gay.  And apparently helium for everybody. 
[01:25:30]  That's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a  gee.  Why wouldn't you let women in the barbershop?  Yeah, punch it out.  All right.  One more.  Normal kid.  Getting a haircut.  Oh, this guy.  We're talking about the, uh, the shave with the, the straight razor or whatever?  Yes.  Uh, John in Philly.  Hey guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey there, Jen.  Hey, uh, I deployed to Iraq in 03 with the Marine Corps.  And, uh, you know, we, uh, had these Iraqis that would set up outside our base to basically 
[01:26:00]  like sell us crap.  So this guy's doing haircuts.  So I figure I hadn't had a haircut in about two or three weeks.  So I go out, sit down in this chair, start giving me a massage, a head massage.  And then he pulls out a straight razor and starts shaving me.  Here I am, my rifle sitting across the room.  And I got this dude, this Iraqi dude, giving me a, uh, shave with a straight razor.  Yeah.  I've seen those shaves on, uh, some of those websites.  You had to have been out of your mind.  I was sitting there thinking to myself in this chair, like, what the hell am I doing? 
[01:26:30]  Like, this is insane.  And there was nobody else in the room.  Right.  So I'm, uh, luckily, I mean, we had like 10 dudes outside, so they would have, they would  have messed them up.  But I have a buddy right, right there with a 45 to his head as he's doing that.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was like, one more cut and it would have been over for him.  It would have been done.  Unbelievable.  All right, John.  Thank you, John.  All right, John.  Thank you, John.  Thank you, John.  Thank you, John.  Linger longer.  Patrice O'Neil in studio.  Yeah, we're going to take a break and then we're going to get to the Larry King clip  because we just, you know, we, we did a lot of time there. 
[01:27:00]  Sam, you stick around to, uh, to walk us through the Larry King clip.  And, uh, for those of you, uh, that you're new listeners out there, uh, that are strictly  satellite listeners, that was your textbook.  W-N-E-W-O-P-T's.  Thank you.  Textbook.  Piss off.  Listener.  Thank you.  Tease.  Thank you.  Yes.  Nice to see.  Thank you.  I haven't seen it in a while.  Thank you.  Classic. 
[01:27:30]  Thank you.  Sam, you're fired.  Take a break.  May I help you?  Yes, I'm calling about the job.  Uh, yes.  Are you coming to work in downtown?  Yes.  Um, I will, I will actually, I was cutting hair uptown and now I want to get there because  I see what you say about the, uh, Wall Street thing there.  Right.  Now, I could probably bring in a lot of clientele.  Okay.  Um, yeah, I'll be interviewing all next week.  Okay, great.  Listen, what about styles?  What kind of styles are you looking for? 
[01:28:00]  We do, we do everything.  Right.  All right, look, I'm pretty far out there.  I've done some wacky shit.  I used to shoot people's heads up with Novocaine and carved roofs in their head.  I mean, if that's too far-fetched, you gotta let me know.  Well, well, first of all, we work on Wall Street, so the people here aren't gonna be that wild.  Right, right.  I did a lot of work in the village, man.  I'm a fucking, I'm crazy.  I'm a nut job.  One time I gave this guy a haircut.  He didn't like it.  He kicked my fucking ass all over. 
[01:28:30]  If you want to come in one day next week, I'll be glad to see you.  Right, right.  As long as my appearance wouldn't bother you.  I'm carved from head to toe.  I'm a, I'm a lunatic.  But I'll come in and we'll shoot this shit and you can see some of my work.  No problem.  Do you want us to, do you want us to find him one day next week?  Whatever's fine.  Listen, I'll bring my children down.  I carved the shit out of their heads, too.  But it looks good.  It looks good.  You never heard of that before?  Excuse me?  Did you ever hear of that procedure? 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  Is that something or what?  Oh, I don't think anyone down here would want that done, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.  All right, great.  Well, I'll come down and you can show me your shit.  And maybe kick me around the office a little and we'll throw ideas.  Back and forth, okay?  Very, you want my address?  Yes, please.  All right, we're at the Trade Center.  Oh, holy shit.  All right.  Okay, I'll see you then.  I'll see you what?  Wednesday?  Next week?  Wednesday is fine.  Okay. 
[01:29:30]  I'm so happy.  Bye-bye now.  Okay, see you then.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, guys. 
[01:30:00]  What's up?  Hope you're enjoying the show today.  We got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Patrice, I want to get that plug out of the way right away because we want to sell some  tickets for that big show.  March 6th, I don't have it in front of me.  Help me out.  March 6th at the Trump Marina, the Taj Mahal, you and Bob Kelly.  I don't know. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, the Xanadu Theater at the Trump Taj Mahal.  It's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, yeah.  It's, yeah.  How are we going to sell tickets?  The Xanadu Theater at the Trump Taj Mahal.  For details, go to TrumpTaj.com.  Yeah, all right.  And it's me and Bobby Kelly.  It's going to be a good show.  You know, if you've never seen me or Bob, or if you have seen me or Bob, come and fucking  see the show.  Dude, I'm going down.  Let's make this a big weekend down in Atlantic City.  Are you going to really come? 
[01:31:00]  For real, yeah.  I'm going to be in Tampa, too, next week, um, the 15th through the 17th.  All right.  You're back on the road.  At the, uh, Tampa Improv.  Yeah, I'm back to working.  You're back to work.  God damn.  I'm thinking I want to rob a bank.  If I get away with it, I get away with it.  If I don't, I do Fed time.  You know what?  You think everybody just thinks they're going to just rob one bank?  Like, some people get away with it for fucking 20, 30 banks.  Dude, why would you rob more than one bank?  Because you don't make enough to live off of forever from robbing a bank. 
[01:31:30]  I don't need them.  I don't need forever.  I just need, pfft, just to hang a little bit.  Not work.  Just $210,000.  Mm-hmm.  That's a, isn't it?  Isn't it cool?  I think you need, I think you need the vault for that.  That's a solid leather jacket you got going on today.  Thanks, buddy.  For real.  Appreciate it.  They're going to pop that fucking red dye money in your bag and you'll run out.  Do they do that anymore?  I think people are just too scared to die.  If I just, if I looked at some fucking goofy Puerto Rican girl and said, yeah, if I get 
[01:32:00]  dye, right, I want to fucking come back and kill you.  He's got it all figured out.  If I get dye, you're fucking dying.  Patrice, but you got to get Mars because I told these guys what happened right after  the break.  But before that, Patrice was checking out some college football last night.  I was following you on Twitter.  Big mom applause.  Oh, I had a, that was a great game, man.  That's too bad you guys don't like fucking sports as much as you should.  Yeah.  I'm getting, you should like sports.  I got a long way to go, but I'm, I'm, I'm finally getting back into sports in general. 
[01:32:30]  Long way to go, but I'm getting there.  College football is genius.  I know college football is where it's at.  I really do know that.  And a guy made a point because I'm a big playoff guy, but some dude made a point about  why you shouldn't have a college football playoff.  And, and it, and it made me think is that in college football, every single game means  some matters.  Not, not just matters.  If you lose, I mean, it, it, it, and when you make that point, like if there's a playoff 
[01:33:00]  system, then you start doing like what the fucking Colts did and you got to rest this  guy cause the playoffs are coming and it doesn't matter as much, but fucking college, if you  lose in week three, you're all fucked.  If you come out as Texas and you're like, we got, we got national championship dreams.  If you lose, you can't even lose a game.  You got seven more games that you go.  Fuck.  You can really do.  You, you could be undefeated and still be ranked seventh in the nation or whatever. 
[01:33:30]  Boise state.  Not only do you have to win, you have to win impressively.  How the fuck is that?  Cause at the end of the year, then they're like, okay, all these guys are undefeated,  but who won more impressively and took on better teams?  It's this whole, if you're Florida and you play cop and state and you don't beat them  75 to three, they, they, they judge you for that.  They, they, they really, is that, it's like the pros where it wins a win.  Is that good?  It's yeah.  It just cause the, the competitive level is always so fucking high. 
[01:34:00]  I know why it's good because if you're beating a team, I love beating a team badly.  Now there's this sportsmanship in the NBA and every fucking sports, uh, league out there  where they rest everybody.  Kobe sits because, you know, there's a 30 point league going in the fourth quarter.  Fuck that.  Not college football.  No.  It's, you know, 52 to three at halftime.  I mean, the stars go all the way to the end because they have to win impressively.  I mean, I didn't realize that's a very good point.  I never thought of that point until today, Patrice.  I never thought of that point until some guy was. 
[01:34:30]  I kind of like what you're saying.  I don't, I didn't agree.  I was a big playoff guy because I don't like this fictional national, basically Alabama  is the fictional national champion because essentially there's, okay, they played a team that was  undefeated last night.  Now they're one, now Texas is one Boise state and TCU are lower level schools who don't  get a chance to even play like Boise state.  Didn't get a chance to play Alabama because no one wants to fucking see it. 
[01:35:00]  So to give Boise state a chance, like in college basketball, North Carolina plays North Carolina  AT&T and they, and AT&T who are going to get smoked.  They do get a chance to say, Hey, you know, I know we're a small school, but we can't  play just as hard as the next guy.  But in college football, it's a guess.  It's a guess in the beginning.  It's like, well, we're going, it's arbitrary.  So you just go, I think we're going to make Florida number one and Michigan state. 
[01:35:30]  We're going to make them number five.  What do they face that on?  Nothing.  So if Florida is who is number one, right?  Loses, they bump down to like number four, but they still can go to number one, back up  to number one, but a team who's eight and O who started off 25th, they don't get a chance  to move up to one.  Yeah.  That's the other problem with the, that's the other side of the argument.  There are teams going into the, uh, the season that don't have a chance at ever being number 
[01:36:00]  one or playing for the national title.  So, and there's players out there, high school players.  They're not going to look at those schools.  They're going to look at the schools that are in that kind of group of schools where  you know, okay, any one of these schools could be ranked number one.  And then there's a whole bunch of them that have great football programs, but will never  be considered number one.  Two days ago, two days ago, three days ago, I think two or three, the Boise State TSU played  in the, um, in the Fiesta Bowl. 
[01:36:30]  Boise State has been winning for a while and TSU, TCU, sorry, TCU has been killing people  this year, but they're both middle act schools, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  So they were undefeated.  That's, it was, I mean, that was a big bowl, but I call it, I called it the, who gives a  shit, like, I was Twittering, this, this should be called the, uh, I want some respect for  my shitty college bowl, because that's what it is.  It's basically like, we're good, but here's what happened. 
[01:37:00]  That makes people, traditionalists go see, their game stunk.  It was a stinky game with two stinky schools.  And that's why they do it that way, I guess.  It was 14 and 10 or some stupid shit.  It stunk.  What's the worst, uh, bowl game every year?  Well, see.  I mean, you got the biggies, like the Rose Bowl and the Sugar Bowl.  Not anymore.  There used to be biggies.  The only game now in town, it used to be, I'm a traditionalist too, a little bit, because  every, you, you watch on New Year's Day, you watch the fucking games. 
[01:37:30]  That was it.  It's like Thanksgiving.  That's true.  Like, you just keep having Detroit on, but they go, why don't you have a good game?  But it's like Detroit is playing and Dallas plays.  Right.  On, on, on New Year's, on New Year's Day, you watch football all day.  The Fiesta, the Rolls.  Now, they all have their own day, and it's, and it doesn't mean anything.  The only game that means, they had the GMAC Bowl with Troy State and, and Southern, Southern, 
[01:38:00]  Central Michigan.  The day before the, the GMAC Bowl, which was a great game.  It was, it was 41-34.  But who gives a shit?  It means nothing.  That's what the, the BC, the, the, the, the BCS Bowl, the, the championship BCS Bowl, it,  it, it's, last night was the only game in town.  No one cares about any of the, the Orange Bowl was Iowa, and it was Iowa. 
[01:38:30]  See?  I don't even know.  Iowa won.  Georgia Tech?  Georgia Tech and Iowa for no fucking reason.  For no reason.  Why do we want to watch that besides people from Georgia and from fucking Iowa?  I would assume, yeah.  It was, it's stupid.  So, that's where playoffs come in.  The playoffs come in, like, come on, man.  Give, the, the, at least the, the, the best six teams play or something, the eight teams, 
[01:39:00]  the top eight teams, got to play two more fucking games.  Or whatever many games.  Oh, wow, really?  Just, but that's where people go.  Even.  But they're not going to do it.  For whatever reason, they keep saying money, but I don't understand why they won't do it.  But last night, it was interesting.  It was, it was a good game.  But college football is, is arbitrary, dude.  It's arbitrary.  But, the thing about the season, every game matters. 
[01:39:30]  Like, you can't fucking lose.  But apparently not to the shitty school teams, because they ain't doing shit anyway.  But that's, that's the argument.  That's the argument for playoffs.  No, but they're playing, right, right.  But they're playing to maybe move up to that group of teams that could possibly be national.  So, that's why, it's a big year.  Well, Boise State beat Oregon, and they beat, um, they beat TCU, Oregon, and one other decent fucking name, brand team.  Oregon went on to, to beat, win the Pac-10. 
[01:40:00]  So, Boise beat the Pac-10 champions, who, which has, consists of UCLA, USC, Washington, fucking Oregon State.  You, uh, just, it's a good fucking league.  Okay.  They beat the champion, but Boise State gets to play TCU.  More importantly, I really did want to know what the worst bowl game was, and I think Richard has it.  Richard?  Yeah, it took place in Nashville.  It's called the Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl. 
[01:40:30]  And it used to just be the Music City Bowl.  Yeah, I would assume.  Everything needs a sponsor now.  Now it's the, that has to be the word name.  The Tostados, this, the fucking.  That does sound like a horrible fucking.  That's great.  So the game was good last night?  Oh, it was genius, man.  Good game.  Because, um, Colt McCoy went out.  Yeah, I saw you tweet that.  Which made me take a little bit of a peek.  Well, yeah.  Colt McCoy is, is, you know, to, to Texas at this point, what, uh, fucking, you know, Peyton Manning is to the Colts. 
[01:41:00]  So he went out the first couple of plays, and you can just know Texas ass, everyone in Texas just wanted to die.  They put in a freshman, Gilbert, who, who, who, at the end of the day, he's going to be a good motherfucking player.  Because he's, he's a big boy, but he came in horrified.  Because Alabama's defense is just 11 fucking, like, Cleophage Johnson with, with dreads and one white boy named Blake. 
[01:41:30]  For some reason.  And, and they, they fucking are mean.  And they was on this freshman day.  I mean, you can feel the blood and the snarl coming out after this, this young boy, man.  Poor fuck.  After a while, he started playing like he is a, a, a, a, a, a true, you know, to go to Texas as a quarterback, you, you gotta be, you know, uh, what they call a blue chipper.  He's a blue chipper.  But, it, it, the score was 24 to 6 at, at half, uh, and then Gilbert start doing his fucking thing. 
[01:42:00]  And, uh, they came back within three.  It was 21, 24.  But, Bama just was meaner.  Yeah.  Just meaner kids, tougher kids, more athletic.  Because, I mean, I'll be honest with you, it was just, it was just too, Texas has just too many white boys.  Yeah.  That do things.  I mean, and, and you just, it's just.  Kind of racist.  I mean, I have to be a little racist.  But, college football, it was very racist.  You need big black guys.  You need big black guys.  Every, every time they show, live like. 
[01:42:30]  Jimmy the Greek was just telling the truth.  I don't know why they fucking.  Never understood why they fired that poor man.  Because, he was just telling the truth.  He was explaining how fucked up it is.  His explanation might have been a little rough, but he was saying what we all knew.  It wasn't rough.  To be true.  They bred the big black bucks.  Yeah.  With their big female.  With their big black female.  To make big black nigglets.  Running around, running around with big back strength.  And that's what they fucking did.  And they got the higher muscle on the back of their legs, which they run faster. 
[01:43:00]  They said there was an extra muscle.  No, they said there was an extra muscle.  Do we have it?  We have it right here.  And weak ankles.  That's why they don't, they don't fucking ice skate.  Let's hear exactly what it was.  Black is a better athlete to begin with.  Because he's been bred to be that way.  Because of his high thighs and big thighs, it goes up into his back.  And they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs.  This goes back all the way to the Civil War.  When during the slave trading, the big, the owner, the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman. 
[01:43:30]  So that he could have a big, a big, a big black kid.  Did you imagine today someone saying that?  He was.  Like he got fired back when no one gave a shit.  No way, but did you see the documentary about him?  They wanted him out.  Oh, they did.  He didn't get, he didn't get out for that.  It wasn't even for that.  It was because it was like, ooh, goody.  We got, we can get him out of here.  He was, he was, he was starting to not be the dude that he was. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, Jimmy, it was Jimmy the Greek mania for a minute.  He was like Mr. T for a second.  And then he started dipping.  And he did that.  It was over.  He was a handicapper for like everything.  They would call on him for every fucking game.  What does Jimmy the Greek think about this?  Well, I'm going to take Atlanta and I got, for everything.  And then he said that off the face of the earth.  One of the owners of football was like black people aren't smart enough.  That's why there's not black quarterbacks and black, and black GMs.  I wouldn't hire one.  I don't own a team. 
[01:44:30]  You can't force teams to hire blacks.  Yes, you can, a little bit.  Come on.  In the coaching ranks, it should be the best guy for the job.  It's true that.  But this is, this is why I do love, I love NFL.  I, all I want, and this is my dream, is that mediocre black people can get a chance to get fucking jobs.  That's it.  I don't want to have to have every black person be spectacular.  Mike Tomlin is a genius coach, man.  This guy is a prod, a coaching prodigy. 
[01:45:00]  He, if he was a white guy, they'd be, I'm telling you, he'd be carried to the field on one of those Roman things.  He's that good of a coach.  But, but, the fact is, there's been enough black coaches and enough black quarterbacks who sucked.  Yep.  So that I can just go, okay, I feel like the best black coach can get in.  Romeo Cornell wasn't a good coach, but Lovey is a great coach.  Marvin Lewis is a great fucking coach in general.  And Tony Dungy is going to go down as one of the greatest coaches of all time. 
[01:45:30]  So, I just don't want, the next black president, I don't want it to have to be this mystical thing.  I just want a motherfucking name, fuck, Leroy, Leroy Johnson, to come in and go, I'm going to run for president, and he has a possibility to win.  That's it.  I just, I just want a non-spectacular, just as many mediocre white people that get to have great jobs.  That's all.  That's fucking it.  Just equal footing. 
[01:46:00]  That's it.  The other thing about the coach last night, you were saying, during the break, and then we're going to move on to Mars.  You said with the Gatorade or something?  Oh, it was two things.  One is a little thing I noticed, is that when they show the background of some of the players, like the top players, it's always, you show the top white player, a concern, concern white parents.  It's always a concern white, no matter how good he's doing, it's the father who used to coach him with that concerned look,  and the mother who keeps looking at him for her emotional guidance, who says, okay, I'll just have the same look you have. 
[01:46:30]  Make sure he's okay.  And then, happy black mama.  It's just happy black mama.  Somebody tweeted, happy black mama with a different last name.  Who's just happy her baby's on the, he made it out the hood.  My child's out there.  And, and they, and last night, if you watched the film of the Gatorade bath, they give a Gatorade bath. 
[01:47:00]  I can't even watch it.  When I saw it live, I, I, I cringed up that deuce chills thing.  Kind of hack at this point, right?  But they've splashed him all over his shirt, like with a minute left.  And, and fucking Nick Saban looked at them with the peripheral look back.  You two fucking idiots.  Just pissed.  It just took away all the steam.  I guarantee you, you might not ever see the Gatorade bath ever again. 
[01:47:30]  The way Nick Saban looked at them too.  That could have killed it.  He might have jumped the shark.  I think they destroyed the fucking Gatorade shower.  It is really fucking just done.  What?  Why not just a cup?  A surprise or anything?  A nice cup of Gatorade and just splash around on his chest.  Like, good job.  Yeah, here you go.  A little fucking Dixie cup.  Oh, you should have seen Nick Saban's face.  It was just, I can't, I couldn't watch it.  The way he looked at the, I couldn't watch it. 
[01:48:00]  All right, I gotta see it now.  They're also saying the worst bowl ever, Emerald Nut Bowl.  That's pretty bad too.  There's a thousand of them, man.  Yeah, I know.  And they start, they start like on December 23rd.  Look at us getting some college football in because Patrice is here.  Thanks, Patrice.  Look at this.  Look, look, look, look.  And he's like, look at this.  He's not happy.  Wow, what the fuck?  And they hit him too hard.  They hit him so hard he moved.  Dude, they hit him with the, look at this.  The big bucket.  Oh, and it's just, oh.  Oh, my God.  That's why he's pissed off. 
[01:48:30]  The guy in the side of the fucking head with the bucket.  He might have taken the bucket to the side of the face.  What the hell is that?  Patrice, you didn't represent that clip right.  He got assaulted.  That's why he's pissed.  That was the bucket itself that hit him.  Of course he's pissed.  Look at, look at.  Oh, man.  Oh, look at him.  Look at that.  Did you?  Oh.  It's time for a new celebration.  Some team will come up.  Look at how not happy he is.  Fucking pissed.  Yeah, when it should be a nice moment for him right now.  Wow. 
[01:49:00]  All right, listen.  We've got to move on because we still have the Larry King clip, believe it or not, Ant.  But first.  Oh, Larry King clip.  I did walk out of the studio.  We were talking about haircuts.  And Mars goes, oh, my.  All nervous and stuff.  I didn't know how to.  But I, well, I just wanted to.  Why don't you tell these guys what you told me?  Well, I, well, I didn't want to kill the flow of the show.  What?  Mars killed the flow of the show?  That's crazy.  You've always been nothing but brilliant at the microphone. 
[01:49:30]  So when Opie stepped outside, I told.  You know what, Ant?  Same with the big boys.  Sam.  Oh, stay seated.  Beat it.  Beat it.  Scram, Sam.  Get lost, Sam.  All right.  Well, no, stay close because you're the only one that knows about the Larry King clip.  Actually, yeah.  And we like you on mic when he's in here because, you know.  Yeah, you just.  Because you can dish it out pretty good.  Mars likes sitting with the big boys.  You feel comfortable?  Loving it.  Loving it.  You're not nervous that you're right next to Patrice, who's.  That's my dog, man.  Yeah, that's right. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  You guys all right?  What are you doing?  I love Mars, man.  Not for his.  He's too hanging yesterday.  Not for his comedy stylings, though.  Nah, his mouth is getting dry already.  Where's my water bottle?  Yeah, get this man some water because he went.  Got stuck to the top of the roof of his mouth.  It's just us, Mars.  It's just his room.  Look at him.  He's fiddling.  Check it out.  Maybe too many people listening.  Back in the days, you guys are as old as I am.  I was inspired by the movie Shampoo.  I'm fucking not as old as you.  Yes, you are.  You're older. 
[01:50:30]  No, I'm fucking not.  Inspired by the movie Shampoo.  Shampoo by Warren Beatty.  Where he was.  I'll give you a lesson.  Don't ever try to get people on your side because misery doesn't love company.  You guys are losing your hair as I am, right?  You guys are losing your hair as I am, right?  You don't say something fucked up to me.  You guys have to go get prostate checks.  Like us, right?  Correct?  You guys have a middle-aged pouch like myself, right? 
[01:51:00]  Warren Beatty.  Yeah, Warren Beatty.  So we're all big fans of Warren Beatty.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Well, if you remember that movie, he was fucking everybody under the sun.  Apparently in real life he was too.  Was he?  Big stats just came out on Warren Beatty.  I'm just remembering Shampoo as he's saying it.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he had some nice stuff.  He had the shag haircut, which is the 70s version of the mullet.  The shag.  He was the Colin Farrell of that time.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  And he worked in a fucking hair salon.  And he was fucking everybody.  Right.  And who else was in that?  A Goldie Hawn?  Look, look at him.  He's got his shag hairdo.  He's rocking, right?  You want to look just like Warren.  And he wasn't gay.  Warren Beatty, right?  Apparently Warren Beatty.  And there was no gayness to his character.  No.  And that is the gayest looking motherfucker right in that picture.  How do you pull that shit off?  Yeah, that was before fucking that was associated with that.  So because of shampoo, you did what, Mars?  And he was fucking on his clients, so I thought maybe, you know, that's a cool gig right there. 
[01:52:00]  So I went ahead and enrolled in, I'm not trying to plug anybody, but Robert Fionn's Hair School of Design.  You're not plugging anything when you say that.  I went to their school.  Mars is making me nervous.  Why?  He's twiddling the fucking wire.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the wire is stretching just, oh, Mars.  So I went to the school for a little bit there, and I was really bad at it.  I did really...  Are you good at anything?  Oh, he's going to kick my ass. 
[01:52:30]  So I gave it a try.  There was things that you had to do with the mannequin, put little curls on it, you know,  weeds and stuff like this.  You fucking went to beauty school?  Yes, sir.  What?  What?  Why?  I just told you.  Drop out.  You're a shampoo.  Because of shampoo.  Don't you realize, like, that was fake?  It's a movie, Mars.  It's fiction. 
[01:53:00]  It's a movie.  It's a guy that is straight in a fucking hair salon.  Has a movie never inspired you?  Have you never been inspired to hunt for sharks?  Not a shampooing movie.  Yeah, like zombie movies.  Or shoot people.  Zombie movies.  Shoot people at the toes.  Because you've never been inspired.  My second salon where I worked at, everybody was straight.  All the guys were straight except one individual.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And that was you.  I didn't find that out.  I didn't find that out. 
[01:53:30]  All straight, huh?  Yeah, everybody was straight.  And they were doing their thing.  And I wanted to emulate, but I failed at it because I was really bad at it.  You look like a coach giving signals.  What are you feeling?  You are touching your chest, your shoulders, your arms.  Whatever I do, you guys are just going to jump on us.  So I, what do I?  Obi, try to lead him into the part that made you come in here with so much excitement.  Just the fact that Mars.  Obi was fucking happy as hell to tell this story.  Because I knew this would be really fun to watch. 
[01:54:00]  Look at him.  He's a nervous mess.  Okay, so.  We love having excuses to get Mars on the air.  So, because of shampoo and Warren Betty.  Warren Beattie.  Oh, Beattie.  I go to Robert Fiance School and I wasn't doing very well and I still owe those people money, I think.  So, I decided to take a shorter road by going to barber school.  By going to barber school, you could actually do it in a year and under an apprenticeship of another barber.  Yeah, but barber school only has you cut men's hair. 
[01:54:30]  Maybe they don't go to barbers.  You could still have a barber's license and I could still cut a woman's hair.  I've never seen a woman except for lesbians get their hair cut.  You can cut a woman's hair, but no woman would go to a barber shop to get her hair cut.  Right, so you get the barber license and then you go to a hair salon and work there.  Because that's allowed.  Under the tutelage of what?  One of the stylists?  Then why would you go to beauty school?  Because that was.  If you could just go to the barber school and work at a salon. 
[01:55:00]  I didn't know that at the time.  Why would anyone go to beauty school then?  If you could just go to the barber school, cheaper, a year.  A lot of people don't know that, you know, that's like.  Because they teach how to cut the other shampoo and conditioner, I guess, and big curlers.  All they teach about is the blue coat.  Weaving and straightening hair out, relaxing hair, you should call it, you know.  All that good stuff.  Tinting hair.  Where are we going with this, Morris?  Well, I was letting you know that that was a job that I had and I told you about it. 
[01:55:30]  I used to work at 56th Street.  How did he say it to you in the hallway?  He said he was really bad at it.  That's the punchline here.  You were really bad at it.  I made women cry.  I used to, uh, I used, yeah, I used to, uh.  Women crawl.  How many chances did you get to stink?  Well, check it out.  Under the, I was an assistant, all right, I used to wash a lot of hair, which I enjoyed  very much.  Hold on, Steve from Bayshore.  This story is fascinatingly boring.  On the highest level of, um, that's a great way to look at that. 
[01:56:00]  Are you enjoying yourself, though?  Because I know Mars, but I'm also, sometimes I pretend I'm in a car driving to work, and  this is the part where I want to be in the tunnel.  Yeah, you never want to be in the tunnel.  I'm going to tell you, the Larry King thing coming over here, I'm like, fuck, I don't want  to miss this Larry King thing.  We're about to play that, right after we get through this Mars thing.  So, um.  So, you're really bad at it, but you like shampooing the girl's hair? 
[01:56:30]  I, I, I, and.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.  You have to, you have to, you have to, you have to, you have to, you have to do that, being an assistant.  So, you do all the stupid little things, washing your hair, getting their robes, getting them  to change into the robes, getting them coffee, wine, and all that, and at the same time,  I'm getting tipped.  It's called a knee.  Okay.  and uh there were a lot of women around so occasionally these salons offer free haircuts 
[01:57:00]  right no no how would they make any money they do let me tell you what just happened  he goes occasionally salons offer free haircuts and then he goes to me presents his hand and goes  right like i would fucking know why would i even know that that's not me by the way  oh my god that's like when i used to smoke like a whole joint by myself and i i was too lazy to get  up and get a drink and you're talking to your friend and i just like sticking together 
[01:57:30]  it sounds like it sounds like you took a mouthful of pop rocks and he's talking  oh god damn it so on these days when they've offered free haircuts does your story have a point  not really this part is not going anywhere usually when you tell a story it leads to a point 
[01:58:00]  or a punchline i like something let's try and get the free haircut story out this is gonna be good  free haircuts so they offer free haircuts that i should know about them so on those free haircuts  those are the times that i used to actually go ahead and get a chance to apply my newly learned  techniques on hair cutting  i'll go home and get your fucking shine box  and he tells the story so slowly like he just says the words slowly  fascinating yeah no please tell the story 
[01:58:30]  for real we'll let you we'll let you uh finish  so on these uh nights of free haircuts and blow dries i used to blow dry hair as well  i've made many many women cry  that's the voice of the listeners yes what 
[01:59:00]  that is uh yeah that that video is making the rounds that's the most obnoxious rooster ever  that's one fucking rooster waking up in the morning  uh yes mars  so my point was that i learning that i suck at hair i don't have the faggot um talent 
[01:59:30]  free haircut day  right that's that's what i'm telling you go back to the beginning we get a reset on those free haircut  dates when i attempted to cut females hair or blow dry their hair i i really screwed it up  i'm gonna show you what's going on what's going on i'm gonna show you what's going on give me all your  tools i'm gonna do a little tink tinkering  yeah let me open up the board and just start working on it just give me your tools i just want 
[02:00:00]  to like you know fix some things around here well i didn't go to you and say hey i have a fascinating  story i just said that i did it at one time you raced down the hall with me  but you know what the thing is mars here i'll be honest with you the story itself could be  interesting it's like you let's say uh uh anyone else in the room danny let's say uh uh went to  beauty school and and worked at a salon for a little while he could convey that in a humorous 
[02:00:30]  fashion uh uh interesting something like that it's not the story it's you i mean he has the  added benefit of saying he was inspired by the film shampoo which is a hilarious detail yes that's a  great detail no one is inspired by shampoo i think i think we fucked him too i'm gonna tell you why  we left mars to figure out what was interesting about that story 
[02:01:00]  and i think i think if he had it we just went yeah i went to i went to school as if he just didn't  want to say it but he came in like once upon a time one of the jobs i like shampoo one of the jobs  that anthony and and one of the jobs anthony and i have is to kind of like lead you and kind of like  nah nah nah nah and then no over here go here nah nah nah not there you know yeah we decided to let you  just try to figure it out yourself always and i always fuck up yeah you do good point  i i went to opie as a homie say hey you know i didn't want to say this on the air but you know 
[02:01:30]  i used to cut hair so excited and he betrayed your hominess came in and made you have a personality  he goes what did you just start working for us this week did you do her hair  you missed that fucking lady's stupid knot it was the worst hair fucking do ever uh i got a question  for you let's say a woman comes in kind of has like medium length hair it's kind of curly 
[02:02:00]  but she doesn't want to cut what could you do for that lady she doesn't want to cut you yeah what  but she's in your shop what could you do for her or what what would you do that used to be like a blow  dry blow dry her hair and then what you style it that way without cutting it you wash your hair  and you use a little use a blow drying technique i'm going somewhere with this let's do it i want  mars to fucking style sam's hair get a blow dryer and a fucking brush do we have a blow dryer well i

[02:10:00]  ago i believe joining lauren silver with us now is deborah tate roman polanski's former sister-in-law  the sister of the late sharon tate on a personal note i knew sharon tate had interviewed her a couple  months before a tragic murder what do you want to see happen i would like to see this whole thing  go away i think that uh there's been a lot of time that is has passed and we need to bring it to an  end you ever talk to roman polanski i have wow how can you have a civil conversation with someone who 
[02:10:30]  so brutally murdered your sister roman didn't murder my sister  come on did i tell you no fucking way he said that that's what he said somebody imitating larry king  no it was straight from the program this could be worse than how important is the board that is  the worst i told you i've ever not only i told you not only larry king that is the worst fuck up in 
[02:11:00]  broadcasting i told you how could anybody even think that that's so brutally murdered it was  it was arguably one of the most no no it was one of the most famous murders of all time and he would  almost get away with it if he said murdered but he had to really punch it off roman polanski came  into the house and just feel that he stole the rights to your sister's song helter skelter  let's see how he gets out of this you have a civil conversation with someone who so brutally 
[02:11:30]  murdered your sister roman didn't murder my sister i mean well i'm sorry but when he when the fact that  he would have this terrible thing happen to him after the death of your sister to once again focus  you into the public right that's what i meant uh i don't have any any problems with roman whatsoever  that's not what he was backpedaling trying to get out of that anthony you do hear the  oh my god he just goes question one didn't work i'll just say i meant question two and that's what i meant 
[02:12:00]  how about the fact where he's from met a horrible tragic end when when caesar was the  is he from rome no no how could you drink folgers coffee when she was murdered right next to  your sister well we got larry king he's gonna explain himself larry good morning shit dicks

[02:13:30]  paid a man who cheated on your sister with a young girl right that's what i meant no  want to hear it again to see this whole thing go away i think that uh there's been a lot of time  that is has passed and we need to bring it to an end you ever talked to roman polaski i have  well how can you have a civil conversation with someone who so brutally murdered your sister  roman didn't murder my sister i mean well i'm sorry but when he when the fact that he 
[02:14:00]  what what is the thing she's saying about what what is she what happened to oh what's the brutal  what's the brutal like what's the thing that she wants to come to an end yeah yeah i i guess the fact  that that um right that the polanski thing is still happening it's still yeah uh uh yeah i mean the  the the one he had oh she's just only defending yeah defending just leave him alone as as his you know 
[02:14:30]  like the bitch is probably 60 now that he was fucking right that was too young yeah the bitch  doesn't care anymore sharon tate she's she said in interviews she don't care anymore sharon tate's  sister is just like yeah fucking uh roman polanski it's kind of what they were doing in hollywood  it sounds like there was some shit going on holy shit yeah so she's just saying leave roman alone yeah  and he says how can you talk to him right how could you talk to a man who so brutally killed six  six million jews no what i meant was his brother he went to france to get away from uh person

[02:22:30]  well you're a sir you're of sir stature but is that because of what i've done in comedy or  because i'm old both oh thank you because you're white mostly  well that brings up the topic we were talking about i went and saw the david mammick uh  play uh play about race oh he just calls it race yeah you've got that picture of the dress  you know i wondered what is the reason for the you know the picture they're using for the play 
[02:23:00]  and it it centers upon and it has that guy from boston legal so it's really easy to believe that he's a  lawyer and that's who i wanted to see the lawyer spader yeah yeah i wanted to see david spader we just  saw what no james spader yeah james yeah it's the david mammick uh play and we just saw what's  his name is in there too and john boy is supposed to be the guy who uh yeah david allen he does a  great job in there and and john boy yes of course john by walton is he in there he's the guy that 
[02:23:30]  supposedly rapes the black girl oh that's the that's what it's about would you call that a spoiler  because i didn't really know that about the fucking show razor was like some rape in there  no it doesn't spoil anything that is the topic of the play is a rape is a racial rape yeah but  it all takes place in the office you can't believe that black chick well that's what you  have to decide in the play i won't tell that what planet is this on on this planet oh okay i just 
[02:24:00]  thought it was bizarro world well now remember they have professional casting people who have  that was on bizarro world wait that's where everything's backwards wait that oh it's this  bizarro play fucking bizarro play isn't it usually the other way around that's great oh my god i see  the same people that did that production do uh well here's the problem is that there's black people  in the audience chase white murder victims and suspects well you just don't sit down black people 
[02:24:30]  and white people together in a theater and then make outrageous racial uh you know stereotypes no  or comments yeah because uh it makes everybody uncomfortable at least i was i don't know there  was were you uncomfortable watching this yeah yeah so it starts out with a rape no no no this all  takes place in the ladies and gentlemen you only discuss it you only discuss it you don't even get  to see the red dress with the sequence you just hear all the the orchestra warming up 
[02:25:00]  rape no there's no ladies and gentlemen there's no orchestra i give to you rape rape  so he could have called it that he could have called it rape but it's a nudity was carby  washington naked oh there's nothing it's only discussed it by lawyers in a room with books  what a boy sounds sexy discussing a white man's his i'll make this shorter not guilty  he gets away with the crime he just it's not what let's all right let's go over the case 
[02:25:30]  white guy right white guy race black woman  leave that book on the shelf there's just no need to even go through this ladies and gentlemen we're  going to pass around a half rage in hiv thank you for watching the show call one of the  motherfuckers and go hi here at james sokoloff and company have you been raped james sokoloff  here at schuster and schuster if you're tired of not going motherfuckers white boys not going 
[02:26:00]  to jail for raping you call us at 1-800 are you saying you could write a better play and it'd be more  uh pertinent and be more realistic yeah fucks yeah nigga well why don't you  your rape why don't you write important things to worry about i'll hit a bitch's pussy with a hammer  like that watermelon  it starts off with me hitting a bitch's pussy with a hammer  but what about david allen greer if if if it wasn't correct for race don't you think david allen 
[02:26:30]  would have something to say about it to the author of the play well no not necessarily this is  hollywood gallagher yeah this is hollywood now i'm not going to say david i because i like the  motherfucker but i'm not going to say that anybody fucking in this business has a has a moment of  integrity where they're going to go has a moment of integrity yeah to argue i never sold out i never 
[02:27:00]  had a tv show but really i have integrity yes that's that's where you fucked up and that's where  i fucked up yeah i i actually fucking say what i feel yeah and that's why we're not in david  mammoth's place i know it i know it why do we fight for freedom of speech if it doesn't exist in  america wait a minute hold on though i'm gonna say something about you sir big fan of yours for years  right big fan you people don't know how deep you are as a comedian in your days of the of gallagher 
[02:27:30]  mania used to say a lot of heavy shit but you had to fucking hide it from the goofy motherfuckers  with the with the toys and the jumping and shit you had a whole you he had carlin s shit yeah  carlin s but you used to have to fucking smash some shit so people would go oh wow it's a lot of  heavy shit oh here's some fucking razors upside your head so you feel better that's that's all  of us i was actually kept off of all the caesar's palace properties by an entertainment director from 
[02:28:00]  lake tahoe because he didn't like what i said at one of my shows up there in lake tahoe one time  and uh when he finally quit they called me and said well you can work our properties again oh geez  thanks i mean you said no because of your principles that ridiculous that ridiculous  thing we call i don't think my fans know anything about it so i don't care my whatever my fans want 
[02:28:30]  he mentions carlin you hung out with carlin a little bit right yeah now did you ever get arrested  for your material like carlin did and and uh prior and uh and lenny bruce certainly no the worst thing  that happened was the caesar's palace thing well i think tv in general was afraid of me because i  seem to be a loose cannon uh showtime love you were on those those only when i had well are they  sticking with me no why why don't they have a gallagher special i haven't had a special in over 
[02:29:00]  a decade and i helped make it a lot of my fans say i got showtime because of you and where are they  now i should have been on hbo i mean it's on the round turntable i blame you were very famous though  you're you're an icon i mean really what more do you want gallagher uh you want to continue i want  to continue to express my opinion more ronnie i well i have jokes and ideas that i got yesterday that  i'd like to have on tv oh no i mean what more do you want in retrospect not in nostalgic value meaning 
[02:29:30]  right now i can understand you like what the fuck but i mean then you were quite as famous as  anybody man you had a beautiful run i would say i had one of the longest runs when you think about it  iconic run three decades is a long time to still be and they come to my show name yeah still i think  he still is fucks yeah i couldn't do a show in manhattan nobody'd come i tried it because you you have 
[02:30:00]  in the city because these uh the people here don't know who i am you they know who you are but  but it's almost like they don't no no i'll tell you it's like bob nelson here's what happened  don't compare him to bob nelson i'm not fucking comparing him to bob nelson he just compared you  to bob nelson are you gonna fall for this ronnie i went to three broadway plays and the oh i walked  into three broadway theaters and the only people who wanted my autograph worked there nobody in the 
[02:30:30]  audience recognized me or wanted to talk to me because you don't wear the hat anymore that's not  i didn't have the hat on when i walk in to buy a ticket they know it's gallagher when i'm putting my  hammer in the coat room she knows it's gallagher the kids that are selling the drinks they know  gallagher but nobody in the audience knows it's me because i'm not this audience i can't work in la  either i don't think that to be true i just think i can't imagine i'm the one selling the tickets i  got 300 tickets in a little out of tower minnesota whoever heard of tower minnesota i got 350 tickets

[02:31:30]  think i'm just telling you the way it is well i would love to be on tv with my present uh but sir  let's be honest attitude who what what seasoned comedian other than carlin did you see on tv you  see they robin williams just did one but last night he was on against the football game it was funny to  see who all that what they put against a young man's and young woman's fucking wow yeah yeah yeah 
[02:32:00]  young people and you still and i'm gonna be honest with you you still you have i gave up mustache  you have i gave up hairdo like you gotta fucking you gotta fucking stay young man and you what  should i you should line it up line it up get a goatee muffins have goatees yeah this part the long  part of your hair get that the fuck out of here and smooth it out isn't that selling out isn't that 
[02:32:30]  selling out instead of selling out to an organization i sell out to stupid fads and trends i'm not  i mean i'm just like you you put it this way the older gentleman if i was to talk to a 20 year old  girl i would have to have older gentleman shit going on a little ties a hat like where she goes  you know you gotta be daddy now you gotta be well let me mention this you don't have your pants  halfway down your butt no no oh so you don't succumb to the trends either because it doesn't make a bit 
[02:33:00]  sense but that's what i'm saying i i have here's what i did i have a crease in my jeans which says  i'm with the style but here i'm gonna give it a little older touch by neating it up with jeans what  i'm saying is i want to look at you carlin and i'm not i'm just saying carlin was a guy who the world  looked to for their fucking feelings meaning how do i feel about all this shit going on that's what 
[02:33:30]  made carlin so relevant he he was a social commentator right i'm saying you're a social  commentator yeah you we gotta look at you i'm trying to help you man yeah we're trying to look  i want to look at you not like this guy gallagher i want to look at you like a fucking social  commentator there's a space now because carlin's not here anymore prize not here anymore no social  i want larry king's show you can't have it you can't have it i can remember whether somebody killed 
[02:34:00]  somebody or not right and you have to now go by ron gallagher you can't go by gallagher anymore  ron was my brother's name he doesn't like talking about his brother either i apologize now you're doing  larry king now what's your what's your what's your name well i never use it you gotta use it now oh i  have to use it now is it david or something i don't know hey wait a minute your brother's name  is ron you have to go by you can't be it gotta be a david or jerry he'll he'll go nuts i go nuts  all right fuck it ron really fucked him up well i used to work at um you know i used to be a doorman 
[02:34:30]  at comedy connection wait you saw the brother act the bro he had he had stopped at whatever  no no no no no no meaning he no no he wasn't doing clubs at that time right he was doing theaters  and yes and he was trying to i i remember what gallagher said call him gallagher too well  because that was my idea i did it yeah because carrot top was kind of like you know doing it  doing his act in the smaller scenes so he got his brother involved to keep uh right that's how it 
[02:35:00]  originally started sir but but mr gallagher this is with all due respect because i'm fucking a fan  yeah so you think if i dress differently and change my hair people would show up no come on  if you called yourself yeah whatever your first name is gal i think and i'm no offense  it's like andrew dice clay okay as great as he was you associate that with a certain kind of thing  if he wanted to change he would have to change everything right if gallagher wants to change 
[02:35:30]  there's gonna be people they're going where the fuck is the fucking fruit that you got if you come  out and my name is something gallagher i shaved my head at one in the year 2000 so that you couldn't  tell where my hair was you know thinning right and they hated it they absolutely hated it and i had  to grow it back in i just couldn't handle everybody and i usually stand up to what people say so you  want him to retire the mallet because the stuff he says in between the mallet is pretty deep it's it's 
[02:36:00]  he's a deep guy and i think that confuses people he should retire he should fucking go have have a  look you have enough name to go on every news thing and say i retire in this thing it's done  talk about the stuff you talk about because it's heavy thoughts and i'm saying i'm not always heavy  why doesn't the coach dump the gatorade when he's ahead and then he doesn't have to worry about them  dumping it on him later in the game i want to know why what how who started this tradition didn't  somebody get a heart attack or almost die because of that cold didn't he start that why doesn't the 
[02:36:30]  coach if i was a coach and i was ahead i go over kick over the gatorade i mean i'm not that deep i'm  just that smart common sense yeah i'm just telling you that i don't think ron i don't ron sorry i don't  i don't know his first name because i don't want to call him gallagher i'm calling you sir for the rest  of the thing okay go ahead sir uh-huh oh wait a minute i like it sir gallagher this is the way  this is the way i need to go i don't want to die man sir gallagher but i need to be in charge of 
[02:37:00]  the world you know i can solve the drug problem the immigration problem and the and the food  environmental problem and with a single stroke and no one's listening to me i want to put a dam  across lower california to dam off the bay of california and pump that salt water out of there  and could you pop up a map and show him what i'm talking about there's some islands halfway down  so it's shallow there and you could put a dam and then all the water from the colorado river would 
[02:37:30]  irrigate that and the mexicans could stay home and grow the lettuce and almonds and avocados that we  need they wouldn't come up here and let the drug lords do it because you know the drug lords aren't  going to quit growing drugs until they grow something else that makes as much money and i pay just as much  for avocados and almonds as i do for marijuana there's a giant uh problem already with what  colorado river running into uh southern california and and keeping that nice and irrigated yeah but 
[02:38:00]  there's still water as long as a motherfucker how many miles is colorado you have to pipe it in  southern california would look like a fucking desert if they didn't pipe that fucking water in  no no the water that is uh that is irrigating the central valley comes from sacramento and our  problem there is it's going to salt up when you put fertilizer and they don't drain it off the salts  remain and that's all going to be a desert for a different reason because it's salty which makes  it a brackish it makes the water nobody's listening this is it's going to happen in the future they're 
[02:38:30]  going to do this so you're not a fan of immigration uh not when the minority is the majority i live in los  angeles this is why he's having so much trouble with a large negro trying to help him with his  career why you don't want to hear it he doesn't want to hear it how dare i is what fucking mr gallic  is saying how dare you hey listen since you have a black team are you standing up for mexicans yes  well how come then the mexican gangs fight with the black gang because they hate each other look at you 
[02:39:00]  yeah you're a smart man it's because they want that to happen oh come on it takes they it takes  they they i think by this i mean no not i ran for governor of california i got 16th and one plank  from my platform was to sing the national anthem in spanish before the baseball and basketball games  because the majority of the audience is spanish you wanted to get those votes

[02:42:00]  i i'm just saying that showtime should have stuck with me and given me a forum to continue  like hbo did what happened with that i don't know they don't call i think it was ratings down in the  last special you did no i think it all it has to do with the old guy that owns it i don't think he's  uh sumner redstone he tried to be in with the uh gaming he bought uh midway games because of uh the 
[02:42:30]  game they had about stealing cars and uh they didn't have another game and so that that company's  stock went to nothing and uh you know these guys they try to buy coolness there's a there's a nowness  missing with you sir there's you have there's a there is a talking about he's part of metallica  there's a i'm looking at the logo there's a 2010ness that has to we have to figure out how to get you  i just told you i am i'm green i just told you how to improve the environment by draining out no i mean

[02:43:30]  an unfair thing i left-hander has to turn around before he starts running uh no he's right there ready  to go i think that the right-handed hitter should run the third oh i think you can go in either  direction and this would be fairer see i have a point of view i can't be part of trends dads and  sir gallagher yeah well what about this this this fad of writing down your this whole thing you're  doing just throw this in the garbage and let's really talk we have been just talking but why is the

[03:00:00]  duck they ought to damn up to colorado oh it don't make sense but it's two characters you get it you  you don't realize how we've changed the world by putting that idea out today really yeah this is how  idea this is what radio is about it's about bringing out new ideas you know that windows 
[03:00:30]  is going to clog up in the future and they're going to and it's going to ruin microsoft really  how does it clog well it doesn't have because it's a bottleneck it's sitting on top of dos and as people  need more and more um megabytes for the uses they're doing on their phones it's windows not going to be able  to handle it and apple is going to take off because they've got their operating system from the beginning  to handle uh this high speed i like windows anyway i mean yeah but it's old-fashioned it's going to be 
[03:01:00]  just like the milkman yeah milkman yeah you're doing a milkman reference i'm saying that windows is  going to be as old-fashioned i'm just telling you leo is a vindictive old man  he won't let it go this son of a gun here it's not called vindiction it's called recall and it's a  method of comedy wow leo yeah yeah recall gets a laugh i'm with them yeah you guys you want to play

[03:02:30]  the showtime specials and everything but what don't you think there's a reason why there's a hundred  people at the club and maybe that patrice has kind of a a good angle of the reinventing of gallagher  and and and maybe you know like you said trim the hair the mustache a little goatee do you really  think if i did a radio show in danbury and said i've cut my hair and i have a little bitty faggy um  mustache it's not going to be they're all going to get in line what about the weather isn't a storm 
[03:03:00]  coming in maybe there's a hundred people because they have more enough sense to stay home in a snow  storm i don't know rationalizing i'm not rationalizing i've always sold my own tickets  i read the theaters and i buy the advertising oh you do i've done it my whole life i'm revolutionary  i'm an individual i don't follow trends fads and fashion i'm not going to wear a gold necklace  on a t-shirt you save enough money not buying a good shirt to buy gold  oh i'm not falling for this because i'm going to help this man back you're giving me this no no 
[03:03:30]  i'm not going to get it at in new ireland i want you to try it on for free i want you to try this on  uh-huh because the reason is i don't this is a uh because it's on the radio it's a it's a cross  it's a uh uh it's a it's a solid looking cross yeah it's a rosary it's it's it's a meaning to it  no the meaning is i've got money why don't you just hang money around your neck no this 
[03:04:00]  see i'm learning because i used to be i bought a lot of goofy  shit and i stopped doing that because i learned someone said it's oh and i learned it from a younger  person we had a water i'm trying i'm saying he's got a cross if jesus was here he'd say now look  you're going to have to cut your hair you're going to have to get rid of the wrong reinvent  yourself why isn't there anybody in the church makes no point at all you need to wear jeans 
[03:04:30]  jesus here take my jeans i knew jesus and gallagher you're no jesus  all right let's go back to mars mars what's going on over there i need a fresh bucket of  water to rinse his hair out because this one right here is a soapy  yeah that's we're waiting dummy got his bucket of water soapy so i'm just sitting here with  shampoo in my hair how was the massage there uh sam it was good but now i'm just stuck with  shampoo in my hair why are we doing this is he having a problem meeting girls not at all well 
[03:05:00]  the hair is working then his girlfriend is so cute well the hair works and uh well no you know  something we haven't seen him uh with his hair any different than it's been yeah but in probably  how long now how many years oh you mean since it was short yeah two years ago yeah yeah and you  have the same girlfriend then yeah yeah i agree with leo this is inane  no it gets the jokes out of that background let's go to mike in new hampshire oh mike 
[03:05:30]  yeah hey guys i can tell you something gallagher is killing it's awesome but he has the line of the  century teach shamu how to press his jeans for the crease in his jeans that was written and awesome  he got nailed i don't think he said that you piece of shit troublemaker you were talking he said you  don't teach shamu how to oh look at the elvis impersonator on yeah like he just just stopped 
[03:06:00]  teller is not an impersonator no but i'm saying shamu did not splash anybody before me  shamu stole my shit see shamu a fucking killer whale what about hey what about core and insane clown  clown posse these are hip young bands that smashed stuff on the audience you said that  insane clown posse yeah what about that war that those crazy relevant 
[03:06:30]  fucking clear it's clear it's clear it doesn't mean you mean q-u-a-r  no-r-o-g-w yes he said insane clown posse as a reference of nowness they're milkmen now by the  milk what they do they crease their jeans they're nobody's leo you're a somebody and we're going to  call him leo i will not because leo makes me look at him he doesn't want to be leo he didn't want to 
[03:07:00]  be leo at one point he still doesn't know you're not my friend oh no i'm your best friend you just  don't know you're not i'm a friend of your life we don't know each other what other acts have you  helped with your advice that have taken off a lot of young kids yeah a lot of young kids have have  gone that way i've talked to a few guys that don't give me credit for helping them get through  isn't the object of entertainment to uh have your own identity and your own look and that way stand  out from the crowd of guys that are wearing gold and have jeans on and are talking about no you know 
[03:07:30]  i don't talk about the difference between blacks and whites and almost every black comedian that's  all they talk about do you talk about the difference between i talk about absolutely i do well i do it  very differently oh yeah no you don't you have the same topics as everybody else i'm sorry wait a  minute i understand this unis but i'm sorry mr wheelchair tiger woods joke that shitty joke you said  you don't think everybody's talking about that but i had a better joke i had a good joke 
[03:08:00]  the standing up fucking walking are you fucking serious that should have not  knocking ahead of it because i don't have jokes leo i have soliloquies i talk about it in reality  world oh you're not his friend i'm not a fucking friend no you're not you're just not we all see  you fuck that holy it is it's a good job i'm trying to teach him how to fucking buy seeds and grow 
[03:08:30]  his own fruit i've seen patrice's act and uh it is and i can't stand the whole you know black  comedy jam or or b-e-t black comic where he's just like it is nothing like that patrice is very  intelligent and he's very uh uh bill cosby never talked about that well he should have probably  because he's doing it now that's why bill cosby his relevance ain't as in the place where prior's 
[03:09:00]  relevance is or carlin's carlin talked about race right yes not really at home i guess i did too when i  just mentioned it yeah you certainly did and you went and saw the play of the same name and i'm gonna  tell you something here's why i'm i'm here to help it it's hard for white comedians to to venture in  that area so a lot of times they put that funny they put down they put down the ability that black  comics have to explore that world that they don't feel like they have it's dangerous to explore but 
[03:09:30]  you want to talk about it because it's relevant sir but it doesn't make sense to say that the that  people are the same no matter what color they are and then get on stage and tell how they're different  who said that every black comedian says how they're different than whites but yet not every black  comedian i can't think of one that does every white comedian goes i just had a baby today uh my wife  just had a baby yeah yeah you know the funny thing about babies i'm not gonna say all white guys do  that a couple of hats do and a couple of hat black comedians do let's get back to mars let's get back to 
[03:10:00]  this shitty hairdo it's back to normal it looks exactly like it why do you have to watch it's  clean yeah it's clean it was clean before it was clean before you've done nothing i wish an eagle  would grab your head and throw you off a cliff  sam yeah walk us through it how was it so far well so far so bad there's still shampoo and  conditioner but is mars doing a good job no he has not gotten any shampoo out of my hair he just gave 
[03:10:30]  off but he's really into shampooing you he enjoyed it very much and by the way i have already uh the  the thing that we were talking about about the balls on the chair thing yeah already when he was  applying the shampoo and conditioner his balls touched your his balls were very yeah right on my arm  now he's drying your hair which i think he did on purpose this is really fucking awkward it's a little  homo-ironic it is if his pubes are this thick as this i don't think his girlfriend can find his  dick oh wow i don't know why i don't know why it's gonna be like an eagle in a nest i don't know why we 
[03:11:00]  have to go there all right we're gonna straighten it now mars this become r-rated look how happy mars is  when was it he really is mars is into his tools he is skadoodly isn't he just like what is this  he used to be whistling mars what are you doing now he's using wow he's combing his hair out what  is that it's a wide tooth comb what do you think you're gonna get a picture that came from 1972 that  comb will probably not get through it what would you do for gallagher and his hair what does mars do 
[03:11:30]  here at the show he's already trying to figure that out he's just trying to figure out what he's good  at that was just the voice of serious management he's the resident also  he makes sure we're on the air yeah he makes sure these things are he flips the switch yeah yeah  basically flips the switch he goes check one two before we come on she's like that she's my new  personal stylist yes of course do you think he knows the difference between a photon and an electron 
[03:12:00]  ask him mars uh ask me a question about it i'm what's the difference that was the question sissy answer  the question answer the question no that's what can be dial i don't know about it i asked the president  of sharp electronics at the consumer electronics show that you know right he said i'll guess and i said  well i just won because you're guessing sure people don't know and they use um electronics all day long 
[03:12:30]  gallery are you racist why holy shit he'd rather be fucking smashing a niggas head  with sledge-o-matic than a fucking watermelon that's what a watermelon it represents nigger head  he desperately wants to be smashing eggplants  he could get a hold of some black babies 
[03:13:00]  that could be the best answer ever why why just why is the answer i don't discuss race in my show  i don't go there no but we're getting to know gallagher oh my head is almost full of man  i'm getting to know you as a person plus making people laugh that's what we do yeah that was a  really funny idea oh now you're helping me are there some like untouchable areas where you won't 
[03:13:30]  discuss i don't do any jokes about black people i i don't mean like um why yeah because i and why  mexicans you touch on mexicans but not on blacks that's right why why not black because of the  reaction of the audience exactly if i you're conforming i gotta talk about what you want to  talk about he's pulling your hair out crazy so you you uh it's an audience the audience would just go 
[03:14:00]  like oh why would they what is your what would be your topic matter if you talked about black people  it would be where the audience would go oh you have ideas because i don't agree with black comedians  that all black people act the same and all white people act the same when you did a white voice you  went low you went like this like all white people i do a great white guy though right you do not  i'm a white guy i don't talk like this but to your white guy patrice i will see leo what i'm saying 
[03:14:30]  here is that the situation yes these are white guys i hear well then you're the one who is why don't  you ask him if he's racist we know he's racist nigga i am i'm a fucking you better be lucky i'm  not white he's told i'll be the storm of the universe nigga that's torch to earth i want to  point you out we've already talked about this patrice will admit it well but i'm racial make  fuck racist you say racial i'm racial right are you racial anthony i'm i think i'm more racist 
[03:15:00]  fair enough i think i am are you race are you racial at least i don't think so i just tell that  one mexican joke and i think it's cute jokes it's cute in your mind in your soul in your in your  everyday life your social viewpoint is it is there a racial viewpoint do you see our president as a  black president or just a man with a but our president is just as white as he is black so he's 
[03:15:30]  not a good example well oh boy now you're gonna get anthony going no i'm just saying a lot of people  especially you know in the middle america there they kind of look at that a little differently  you know hawaii how many black people you know from hawaii uh all those samoans they call them  out there kinkamehameha it ain't a lot of them i don't know kinkamehameha that guy he's a spoon fork  at kentucky fried chicken they've got a thing that's a spoon and a fork at the same time 
[03:16:00]  that's what the president is king a sport king is a sport canoey and that's the problem with  america is nothing's well defined and everything is right down the middle half of this and half of  that yeah that's the problem oh wait sam wants to tell everyone that mars doesn't know what he's  doing mars does not know what he's doing mars mars is he's got your hair up in a clip and he's so  he's getting to the under yeah the salt trying to use that stupid brush on he's just pulling hair out  he doesn't know what he's doing he's not happy sam's not happy i need a black hair stylist there's 
[03:16:30]  one one person doesn't have to worry about a hair being pulled out this guy's got so much hair it  can't find a place to be sam you shouldn't lose a few hairs half of it half of it needs to be pulled  justice with that i could grow dope in his hair and the cops would never find it i'm 26 i can have my  hair no you can't get the clippers out and i can smell the shampoo and conditioner burning i'm

[03:20:00]  black people do oh shit oh shit told you this no he's mad at me because i asked that question  before break here's why he's upset because he knows fuck that he is the hulk and you brought in

[03:21:00]  question bad well i guess you'll have uh either an oriental or a gay comic on next time and i'll  have to deal with that oh shit talk race all the time in the show we really talk a lot i didn't  know i was on two days ago and we didn't discuss no no because it's not an everyday but he kind of 
[03:21:30]  just we we're all over the place but it's race only comes up every other day it's whatever  it's a very kind of for real the world is talking about thing in this day and age political correctness  is like yeah really a big thing and and we talk about that we talk about sex we talk about toilet  habits we'll talk about anything but race race is kind of a big thing especially in this day and age  with uh obama being president it was a big issue there was a uh there was a report a little story  about jimmy the greek on during the football oh yeah yeah we did we flick around we did jimmy 
[03:22:00]  the greek i know did you flick around i was interested in what the networks played against  that game trying to get attention because they did the born whatever it is odyssey or whatever  yeah there's like three born identity they did that i love that movie i watch it every time  yeah so i watched that and the football game it's kind of a pitiful game i didn't watch the  football game no well i wanted to know who won i like crime shows i saw him got hit in the bit get  hit in the back but it didn't look like it hurt him that bad his arm went to sleep it had to hurt 
[03:22:30]  though right no it was just a little hit it was just a little hit but they i guess they put them out  they could have had that as a strategy we're not going to come back from what happened before the break  huh i was just looking at sam's hair yeah sam's hair by the way it's over and we got nothing  accomplished it's a cross between frederick douglas wait marge wants to aqua and and oh shit he's  aqua netting and george washington on a dollar bill can i stand up now sure yes there's no difference 
[03:23:00]  you put a hair clip in his fucking hair you did nothing there's a part he added a part you have to  pay for that now yes that's to pay for that this is why there's black barbers and white barbers oh  wait there it is gallagher wait gallagher is got some ducats wait gallagher is running on a dollar  bill he's drawing oh it's a gallagher bill wow look at that a dollar bill looks like gallagher i'm current  he say he's current he put a mustache and and current currency can we put that on the internet 
[03:23:30]  it actually looks like uh adolf hitler it does a little but why don't you do that look go with  the free yeah hey there you go oh shit really no blacks or jews at my show  i do remember watching a lot of your specials though uh in the 80s and you know all 14 of them  are available for 22 dollars on ebay or amazon 22 teen special that's the bid you get it for that 
[03:24:00]  all right you could go show them the it's called the sledge-o-matic set i go on ebay and do gallagher  videos yeah they're not new they you know they copy them and then they sell it you get a very uh  specific demographic to your audience i've noticed that too yeah smart okay that's uh one way to put 
[03:24:30]  it patrice isn't talking it is funny watching it watching the guys with the dry look from gillette  hair and the big 70s porno mustaches and stuff i think it's interesting to look at the the audience  when you go there and go people come up to me and they say we were stoned when we watched your show  and i said i was too and you know that's where the jokes came from if your knees bent the other way  what would a chair look like what makes teflon stick to the pan why does net zero cost 995  i remember that one the uh teflon sticking to the pan that got me thinking for a while 
[03:25:00]  and did it hurt how the hell yeah thinking is thinking is well this is the problem with america  is that we think stupid is cool and then we're losing to these other countries because we don't  have an emphasis on anything we don't even have a super collider uh now the french are the leaders  in subatomic research and we're free because we had the atomic bomb during world war ii so we've  already shown that if you lead the world in subatomic research you stay safe and free and instead 
[03:25:30]  we've allowed our friends the french who were selling furniture to saddam hussein  and are never our friends you know we are with americans though we kind of sit back and then when  we really need something bad we buy it we get it we buy it with borrowed money and the chinese loan  it to us gallagher what do you think of the chinese and the french there are enemies look at it look at  no more french people at your shows now no more french words in my mouth you can't go out to eat  without speaking french there's a restaurant a buffet a cafe a cabaret there's a valet there's a maitre d 
[03:26:00]  you can order a la carte or get the soup du jour i start every day with a latte and a croissant and  i don't like it that's a carlin thing right there it's french good stuff it's an observation  there's a that's why i said carlin he was the king of the people don't realize that about africa  there's uh oh wow i'm just asking about africa like you asked about china and fucking france i'm  just saying that's a continent not a country that's right how about fucking nigeria oh we all hate 
[03:26:30]  that place what's what's their major export scams fucking yeah scams and now fucking underwear  bombs there was a bit of death here and we uh we're to send you six million american u.s dollar  please give to us information that's nigerian's export and fucking underwear bombs  and the emails and the emails about how they've got some money they need to get out of the bank 
[03:27:00]  and can you help them yeah why are you getting mad i don't know i guess it wasn't clear it wasn't  clear all right how are we going to get everyone on the same page again gallagher we're on the same  page if gallagher just stop his racism for four seconds we can love each other that was amazing  he feels like he was forced into a corner right when you replay this and you hear it  there's no force anywhere you hear what it is he just he's he just i hope there's a giant burning 
[03:27:30]  sledge-o-matic on your lawn motherfucker i'm telling you just stuck in the ground he's gonna be  smashing afro wigs tonight gallagher's not that way i know he's not i don't but he's but i don't  understand why he feels he he got he got mad at the question and i and you know well it was a stupid  question if you had even asked but the greatest answer ever well i know but it was a stupid 
[03:28:00]  question because and gallagher even said it there's no winning answer to that question how about no it  no because that implies that you're covering something if you're a racist why would you tell the truth  right why would why wouldn't you lie that's what the fuck i say leo that's what i'm saying just  asking the question don't listen to what people say notice what they do guilt right asking the  question is implying guilt like if i go right are you a racist there would have to be a reason i would  ask that that's right i'm not that's right tell your nose you're lying opie do you tell your nose 
[03:28:30]  i'm what what people notice about me is that i i appear old-fashioned because i am a traditionalist  and maybe a conservative but i want no wow i didn't say that gallagher i think the change is not  fountain guy myself believe me i like to give you a look i like two water fountains and he's getting 
[03:29:00]  mad now we don't want our new friend getting mad no but i do want to know his views on sickle cell  would you just stop being racial for a minute you know you know something gallagher you know who the  first person was to do your act the white guys with the fire hoses during the civil rights movement  they just not look he is giving you uh i've never seen a look like that 
[03:29:30]  we just lost him i know he did look him in the eye i dare you i dare you  i'm taking it to the umpteenth level is what i'm doing to diffuse it  if you take it to the umpteenth level it diffuses the whole thing that's just fucked up it's crazy i  know i'm out of here it's sick no one would even think that i'm sorry i wouldn't i wouldn't even  blame you it's not necessary i'm out of here too i'm not staying five more minutes i'm done oh wait a 
[03:30:00]  minute is it are you okay gallagher i'm sorry no he took his glasses off it's a joke that means he  can't read anymore it's it's a it's a he took his glasses off it's all shit oh shall it's over  maybe he puts him on over the hood oh wow come on sheesh come on as a joke my goodness because we  know it's it's called i like ridiculous it's so ridiculous it's fucking absurdity that that 
[03:30:30]  it's funny to to say it because it's so ridiculous and out of the question that that you would even  have any feelings like that like that people have known you for years there's never been any  controversy about you and race whatsoever so they even say it it's funny because it's anthony  you're digging yourself a hole just you're digging yourself a hole with him just stop here's the  question you ask all right why a watermelon oh wow he said it the other day a hard casing wrapped 
[03:31:00]  around something soft and mushy inside explodes better it has nothing to do stop it stop it man  i just tapped out what the fuck is wrong with you man he's not talking this is bullshit this is just  wow bullshit man this is bullshit what you guys doing so well i tapped out everything's cool though right  i'm i'm not even gonna i'm done i'm done there were just things rolling in in my head and stuff i'm  done every night i work with drunks and they're never done i don't believe i don't believe you 
[03:31:30]  are you implying i drink a lot i'm saying i know childish behavior and you're gonna make another  racist gallagher joke before the end of the show you can't help yourself you can't stop you know what  what i won't i don't believe you i won't i don't believe you i will prove you wrong by not doing that  i won't first you criticized him for saying the question then you went crazy with the same topic 
[03:32:00]  i'm a nice guy in the room my job right inconsistent behavior that's right at least you know what you  get with me it's called good cop bad cops shut up we use it all the time oh wow no no i'm not saying  i will i will bring this all back uh together yeah you want apologies what do you what do we have  yeah you want an apology or nothing but respect for i apologize for anything i did all right what  did you do i don't know what i did so i'm gonna fucking i'm gonna apologize for anything you think 
[03:32:30]  i did sir because i'm fucking on your side go ahead gallagher i apologize no no no that's not good  enough let's see gallagher what did patrice do you anything there's only one thing i can't apologize  for because i can't help being that but other than that i'm fucking gonna apologize for anything i did  in terms of personality that annoyed him i'm apologize but i don't know what it is but i will  i swear because feelings matter because how you feel is how you feel i know you know even if i don't  think i did anything wrong that doesn't mean that in pick impact versus intent yeah and my intent was 
[03:33:00]  not to make fucking leo gallagher upset i don't my intent was to to say that he's a great comic and i  don't want to walk out of here feeling like but the impact was something wrong and i want to know  what it is sir and i apologize for i don't give a fuck what it is if i spent my entire career keeping  my first name a secret how are you my friend by getting your girlfriend on the phone and telling  the whole world my name it ain't like the bitch knows you she went on google she typed in real name 
[03:33:30]  that shit said leo nigga what the fuck we're trying to bring everything back together patrice now sit down  what that's the shit he was out he was by the way he was just apologizing right sit down you asked  gallagher and he told you what the problem was i'm sorry for you didn't want anyone to know you  know what that's what i'm saying i'm such a dick so stop yelling you're right uh sir samuel 
[03:34:00]  miss uh gallagher sir i apologize for that i didn't think it was again the intent was not to be like  that the impact was disrespectful and i apologize with all my heart and i'll never say the the word  you're the first name again and they ever i i will even go a little further here the reason he was  using your first name was believe it or not out of respect because he was saying that the gallagher  thing in an image that's true that's fucking true that is true he was dehumanizing gallagher 
[03:34:30]  i was dehumanizing him by using his real name absolutely no he was saying that gallagher the  name itself is attached to the smashing the watermelon and and and and the sight gags and  things like that when in essence you're a very intelligent man who could do stand-up comedy  a la george carlin and and and uh uh such that you know and can i add this yes i i tell of there's  a lot of black comics who go by uh snooki jones booger chops and all that shit i go what the fuck 
[03:35:00]  shit what's your name because that shit is like they introduce themselves as you know my name's  bonnie b clifton but it ain't his name so i was just saying that if booger chops was sitting here  you'd get your girlfriend on the phone and find out his real name and tell everybody because that's  what and he wouldn't that's the type he would not come up there is no wikipedia for booger  gallagher is one of those one word he's a one word guy and that's part of like prince and

[03:42:00]  and you go there go one of them that's all i've come across you don't redo your apartment  well that's one of my friends sorry who's the immature i'll tell you the guy i told the  hair cutting story he's a friend of mine now and his partner uh uh a designer how often do you  call him we go to dinner once a while you know with couples without preconceived ideas of what  people are like you can't do comedy you can't do it without prejudice without prejudice 
[03:42:30]  right when you have to say that gay people are into hair and decorating that chinese uh orientals  can't drive right that uh mexicans are short but gallagher in in my right world that's what it was  my gay friends one is a hairdresser and the other guy design where am i going to come across  where am i going to find a gay uh person to hang out with like i don't i don't really uh frequent 
[03:43:00]  enough uh places and i understand they could be anywhere in this office you want me to go get  you three gay people on this floor i might have no way no way to go through life they have a blue  shirt and a white collar oh yeah that's that's a giveaway yeah would you wear a blue shirt with a 
[03:43:30]  white collar hell fucking no no but that makes you gay yeah why is that well that's one of the things  one of the things that would give you well look how do you go through life and you're unable to  identify people i can identify gay people can you identify a crazy person if you're walking down an  alley could you tell whether that was a nut can you identify a dangerous person can you identify a  truthful person yeah well that's a little harder but yeah there are certain things that are easily  identifiable and others that are a little more difficult but uh gay people uh flamboyant gay 
[03:44:00]  people you could spot a mile away but there are a lot of gay people that uh oh are fine they just  i don't work they do you'd never know they were gay i don't have flamboyant gay uh friends  no no that's too much for me gallagher at that point while i was talking gallagher put his head in  his hand and was rubbing his temples like i would you shut the fuck up anthony why did i bring my  mallet today yeah i do have my mallet i've got it out there i have to take uh i have to rent a car 
[03:44:30]  and drive to connecticut in the snow oh why don't we have someone driving this for a hundred people  because there's gonna be more than a hundred now there really is oh there will be yeah and  you call us and tell us there were more than a hundred people on monday yeah american nazi party  i don't think we're ever gonna see gallagher again does that count you said uh oh i said okay so  you can you'll see him again all right it just he needs he needs it's gonna need time 
[03:45:00]  you'll see him again is he at work is this what he does on the show yeah yeah oh he stands over  there yeah yeah gallagher people want to know if you're on valuable gallagher i did twitter one  day and it was interesting and amusing but i felt that the uh i don't have time for that yeah but  that's what is happening i know it you should get involved with some of the stuff that's happening  that might help you a little bit well i'm trying people saying they want to get you on twitter do  you have a twitter account i it's too much to do for one person i'm national i'm going all over 
[03:45:30]  the country i really can't fart with people one of the time i had a joke that i was going to say  and i didn't say it why because i told gallagher i wouldn't gallagher would you like to hear the  joke that i was going to say would you like to hear the joke no  what he thinks is a joke is not a joke it's just a comment or criticism on gallagher  no no it was and you guys all laugh because it's funny is it about gallagher yeah it was yes and it 
[03:46:00]  was right i'll tell you this if we weren't on the radio he wouldn't say it because it wouldn't  what's funny is the fact that you're embarrassing me in on a national scale no no i'm not trying to  embarrass you i'm just trying to like throw funny shit out there so the listeners go ha ha  well let's make fun of you then people make fun of me all the time they call me a  lunatic i'm a gun nut i'm an alcoholic i'm a pedophile racist i'm a racist absolutely  uh i'm selfish twice i'm a racist sandwich everything else in between see i think the 
[03:46:30]  problem is gallagher doesn't understand the show fully yet we make fun of everybody and everything  we really do right and i'm sure you're gonna get that clip including the guest up in a promo  me blurting off all those things no but i don't think we i don't feel like we were picking on you  okay let's go to the phone let's go to the phone all right just plump one down randomly don't go  looking are you sure well just no jesus christ are you sure okay i was gonna go the other way 
[03:47:00]  see that's kind of funny right yeah all right i wish i could have sort of twitter a little bit  yeah let's just be kind of funny uh patrice has become the cooler get gallagher wait all right let's  i'm just start i'll start from the top richard in indiana richard yeah uh first off i gotta say  anthony shame on you yes we all know it you you are so right uh yeah the trees has become such the 
[03:47:30]  cooler you should never bring him on when you've got anybody of any importance on there he runs them  all off um and uh i'm gonna i got someone i have to say before someone else does because i know they  will the house next door to me oh let me go to uh jojo hi jojo stop it hey you guys treated him fine  he he treated better than most guests but if you go to you've been treated better than most guests  wow that's not saying much sir that's not saying much about how we treat our guests you're supposed to 
[03:48:00]  help us out yeah but he wonders why he doesn't sell tickets go to his website and there's an ad  for every other comedian why are you doing that it's google does that because why would you put that  up there like i go to your website to buy tickets for your show yeah and i got a chance to buy  a seinfeld ticket yeah really lampanelli wait what do you mean google's doing that google if you  allow google to sell ads on your website michael richards yeah i'm just being cutting edge you asked  me to be a part of what's happening no why are you allowing google to sell ads on your website 
[03:48:30]  you don't have to do that no you don't have to so why are you doing that i thought it was cool  i thought it was cool are you making three yeah they pay you that's what google is google sells the  ads is it worth what they're giving you i don't know i could call my office  well i could call let me uh phone my office i don't know what the income we're gonna get you a  but i don't think uh let's give you a twitter account i have one and i told you i started it  and i and i met some people involved in uh developing uh applications and i talked to them 
[03:49:00]  i have a couple ideas i have smash my face where you take a picture of somebody who irritates you  you send it to this website you mutilate it in different ways put it back in your phone and then  show the person what you'd like to do to them physically but you only do it virtually i think  there's a lot of money in hatred you want to get answer money and i want to meet the guy who  started uh electronic arts because he has a company that does that yeah and i think he's  really cool i can't remember the name of uh the guy's name though he started he he give out your 
[03:49:30]  twitter account i want to i want to show you the power of the show you're gonna get i don't want to  have to deal if you don't call them back or or vlog them back then they're insulted why would i no you  just throw i can't around every once in a while i but i'm doing that here on a satellite good point  that's the way i need fair enough fair enough i do yesterday i did seven radio interviews  ours was the best though right well i didn't go there physically i do it on the phone but i'm 
[03:50:00]  just saying i'm the best i get it i get my message out plus i do a show every night and the people uh  listen to me you should do a little radio i do a lot of radio no you should do an actual radio show  he does you do a lot of radio shows yeah but where it's your show and you don't have to deal  with us yeah you just deal with you i'd have you on as a guest oh boy let's say hi to fred in  hoboken fred all right fred good morning boys i wanted to just point out to gallagher that in 
[03:50:30]  today's day and age saying someone is oriental is now considered racist oriental is for objects  all right asian they would say asian supposed to be asian right i also hello yes sir oh yeah  no and i also want to say i completely think that gallagher should be thankful to you guys because  you don't see gallagher getting an hour two hours of radio on anybody else's hours not having them  anthony slow down a little bit i think this guy's making a point i think gallagher does owe us an  apology today we gave him a lot of exposure we've sold a lot of tickets for his show let's find that 
[03:51:00]  out let's call one of the theaters and see how the ticket sales are all right are they open i want  to agree with the last caller that patrice is really on the radio but not everybody gets them  he scares people off it's the people who get them like louis ck and bobby that make the show great  and gallagher was right there but you know he got too offended but he should really be thankful  for the airtime you guys are giving them all right let's call the treehouse in denbury  connecticut gallagher's going to be there tonight i want to see if we sold tickets to gallagher 
[03:51:30]  that's right let's see all the abuse he talked that's right how do we get uh the treehouse on  the phone right and i want them to be honest do you think that any exposure is good exposure even  if it's bad uh and a bad very good question thank you there was oh no there's in most cases yes but  i think there was something that did come up recently where you went wow that type of thing is  not what was it it was a big story well what about tiger woods is he oh well that's the story  more of a man it's all based on your image yeah if you have a squeaky clean image and some yes
