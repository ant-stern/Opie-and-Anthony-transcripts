<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with listener calls and the hosts' commentary on their recent D.C. trip, the grueling nature of their morning show, and their annoyance with crying babies and inattentive parents on public transport.  Jimmy Norton's flatulence-induced seat-acquisition on a train was recounted in detail.  They also discussed a listener's encounter with a child-kicking man at the DMV, and expressed outrage over the use of a mentally handicapped child as a suicide bomber in Iraq, playing a song about "retards" in response.  Other topics included Groundhog Day (with a call from the Punxsutawney festival), the Pope's hospitalization, a Yogi Berra lawsuit, and a fake Delta Airlines commercial using AAVE.  The hosts also promoted "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," encouraging listeners to display "WOW" on their cars to solicit flashing from women.

The show then shifted to A&E's decision to air unedited *Sopranos* reruns, followed by a discussion about a past call with Sarah Jessica Parker and a vulgar assessment of her and other actresses' attractiveness.  They returned to the topic of a mentally disabled man used as a "guided missile," finding the situation darkly comical. A discussion of a New York City murder followed, focusing on the racial aspects and perceived media bias. The hosts then discussed Ward Churchill's controversial 9/11 statements and included a live remote from the Groundhog Day event at Gobbler's Knob.  The firing of two staffers from "The Miss Jones Morning Show" for playing an offensive tsunami-related song parody was heavily analyzed, along with Councilman John Liu's criticism of the station's response.  Audio of Miss Jones' distancing herself from the song was played, leading to a heated discussion of her perceived hypocrisy. A small plane crash in New Jersey was discussed throughout the broadcast, with listener calls offering varying levels of detail and speculation on the survival rates of those on board.  Opie's low blood sugar led to a prolonged and vulgar rant about the staff's milk-procurement methods.

A segment featuring listener-submitted phrases, many sexually suggestive or violent, transitioned into a discussion of vulgar children's songs ("Poop Goes the Weasel" and "Funky as a Diaper") from XM Kids, with a call from DeeDee (Cricket), an XM Kids employee, explaining their intended toilet-training purpose.  Further discussion included the Groundhog Day event, noting the poem's mispronunciation of "prognosticate," Nikki Cox's relationship with Jay Moore, and another Sarah Jessica Parker call, where she responded humorously to the hosts' previous criticism of her appearance and invited them to the *Sex and the City* set.  The hosts debated the appropriateness of their humor, repeatedly played the earworm "Banana Phone," and Bob Kelly was mentioned as waiting outside. Kev TV called in to discuss the song's annoying quality.  Bob Kelly eventually joined the broadcast, recounting a story about a sexual encounter with a large woman and an awkward encounter with a porn star.  A call from "Lady Di," discussing her job search and her son's father's suicide, concluded this segment.

A subsequent segment featured Bob Kelly in the studio, continuing the "Banana phone" bit. Kelly recounted a graphic sexual encounter.  A Christopher Reeve-themed song parody was played, followed by audio of Hillary Swank discussing CPR, which was met with mocking commentary.  A planned discussion of midget-related audio was postponed. The show concluded with listener calls summarizing their takeaways, an XM Radio commercial, and a train sound effect following Lady Di's call.  Dr. Jeff was present in the studio during portions of the broadcast.

[00:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet head?  It's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes, quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place. 
[00:05:30]  Controversial talkers, controversial talkers, controversial talkers, controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony show.  We are just, you better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  But enough of this palaver, but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He was banging clucks that way, just two at a time.  You're just a tool.  You don't keep your hands off of my mule. 
[00:06:30]  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  You're tired.  Of course I am.  Yesterday we were in Washington, D.C.  Today we're in New York, C.T.  Today. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Getting into the guitar solo there.  We're supposed to do that once a month?  Yeah, pretty much.  It ain't happening.  It ain't happening.  It ain't happening.  We'll put a stop to that.  We'll be motivated.  We'll probably do it by the end of the month. 
[00:07:30]  Probably late February we'll go down to Washington, D.C. again.  And then after that, why don't we make it every two months?  Why don't we make it once a quarter?  Yeah, four times a year.  Why don't you guys come up here and visit us?  Oh, please.  We can't be bothered.  Please.  No, it was a good time to go down there.  It's just a hassle to try to travel and do a morning show.  It just doesn't make sense on any level, you know?  No, it doesn't make sense to do anything in a morning show. 
[00:08:00]  It's just one of those things.  You sacrifice your being to come here and do a show for four hours.  It's impossible to do anything else in life while you're doing this.  Yeah, because after the show yesterday, we had more meetings to do down at the XM compound.  And by noon, I was just laying around on a couch waiting for the ride back to the train station.  And people are coming up to say hi and stuff, and they can't understand why I have no motivation.  Yeah, they're all happy.  You got a pep in their step.  And I'm trying to tell them, look, you know, I've been up since three because I wasn't able to sleep the night before. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, because we did the steak dinner and stuff like that, which was really nice of them.  But, you know, to eat all that steak and all that food and then go back to the hotel and crash right away, it's impossible.  No.  So four or five hours later, you're waking up with a stomach thing happening and, you know, doing the show.  It's just weird, I guess.  And being on that train, it's just enough.  Choo, choo.  Once a month.  Once a month doing that.  Some people do it every day. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, I know.  And we were on the easy train.  We were on the Acceler, which isn't that much faster.  I was looking at train schedules.  You know, Washington to New York, it's about three hours and 20 minutes, I think, regular train.  Yeah.  Acceler, two hours and 55 minutes.  Are you really saving that much time in the end?  Not really.  They make it sound the Acceler, it's like twice as fast, you know?  Yeah, you think it's like one of those Japanese bullet trains.  It's just a little faster, and if there's any type of delay, then it's not different. 
[00:09:30]  But I got to hand it to little Jimmy Norton.  First of all, he was farting, and he thought that was really funny.  On the train.  Well, there was a couple things that happened.  Well, the last one, he farted so bad, and I'm laying there, you know, kind of all crunched up  and reading email off my trio and just hanging out, just trying to, you know, kill time.  I was playing solitary.  You guys probably saw me doing that for hours.  Yeah.  Hours on end.  Nice OCD I have, huh?  And this fart was so bad, and I was thinking, I've been up since like three in the morning. 
[00:10:00]  I swear to you, I thought I was smelling like my own bad breath.  Oh.  And then realized, thank God that's not me, and then I'm like, oh, that's right, he's  sitting right behind me.  And I could just feel my seat kind of, you know, shaking a little bit, because he's laughing,  and he's got his...  He's hanging over the seat laughing.  Yeah, he's got his feet on my, well, on the back of my chair would be his, you know,  foot rest or whatever. 
[00:10:30]  So the whole chair is like kind of moving a little bit, because he thinks it's hilarious  to just let these bombs out.  It was awful.  But then the other thing, we stop in Philly, and that's when all the business guys get  on.  Yeah.  And it just reminds me that I picked the right profession.  I would have never made a good businessman.  All these guys with their blackberries, their blueberries, their strawberries, I don't know  what the hell they're called.  Whatever, they're blackberries, right?  Yeah.  Every single person has a Blackberry, and every single person has, you know, a phone 
[00:11:00]  with, you know, a hands-free option.  They all get on in Philly.  Did you notice this?  Yep.  And right away, everyone was on their cell phone, because it was the most important thing  to do, which is business, all the way to New York.  Whose phone was ringing, and the guy wasn't picking up?  Did you hear that one?  Whose cell phone rings for like 15 times, and no one picks it up?  It was loud, too.  And it just kept going and going.  Answer them.  Answering.  You know, I understand you think your job's important and all that, but I was listening 
[00:11:30]  to some of these conversations.  Nothing.  There was nothing going on.  They were calling people because they could.  Yeah.  And they were talking really loud because they're used to just, you know, not being shy about  it.  Like, let's say you and I, we don't take that train trip often, because I did see you  on the cell phone once.  I used the phone.  Did you hear me?  No, I did not.  And I could tell that you were almost embarrassed to be on it.  You had your hooded, like, coat on all the way over, you know, almost your entire head.  And then you were turned toward the window like this and whispering into the phone. 
[00:12:00]  Like, I'm going to need an eight ball delivered to me.  Yeah, like I'm making a drug deal.  And then you got Joe Businessman.  Yeah, that document that needs to get to Boston.  I'm just checking on that.  Did she send it out?  Well, could you email it to me to make sure she sent the right one?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Your job's not that important.  And we don't care about it, you know?  I don't care to hear his conversation, especially when you're on the train.  A lot of people try to sleep on the train, you know? 
[00:12:30]  Right.  You're a little sleepy.  There's nothing really to do.  So you want to go to sleep.  And these people are just yapping.  I was bundled up on the two seats, just sleeping away.  And then I heard the announcement in Philly, we're going to need every seat possible.  Well, we got a full train, so if you're taking up two seats or this or that, you know, this  would be a good time to clear the seat next to you.  Now you're going to have to sit with somebody.  So, yeah, I had Joe Businessguy next to me.  He was working on his documents.  Now, you and Jimmy were sitting in front and behind each other. 
[00:13:00]  Jimmy was sitting behind you.  Right.  You both had an empty seat.  Right.  Next to you.  Right.  So when you were told that other people were coming on and going to be taking the seat,  why didn't you guys double up, buddy up,  and then you wouldn't have to sit next to some mutant that came in.  You've hung with him?  Yeah.  Why would I want to sit next to him?  You always hope that the seat next to you will remain empty.  Well, is that it?  The hope was there that maybe you'll be the lucky one with the empty seat?  And that's what I'm going to get at.  And plus the fact that Jimmy's sitting right next to you, 
[00:13:30]  then all the goofing gets really uncomfortable.  Next thing you know, you're a gay couple going to New York.  He starts putting his hand on your leg.  It's just awful, and it's not worth it,  especially after you did a couple days in Washington.  You just want to get home and crash.  You're just tired.  You don't want the jokes.  You don't want him leaning his head on your shoulder.  But I helped him get his...  He had the only empty seat on the entire Acceler from Philly to New York  because no one even did.  Well, not the whole time.  I believe I did see a woman sitting next to him.  Well, okay.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I'm getting at. 
[00:14:00]  This woman sits next to Jimmy,  and her business partner, I guess, was sitting next to me, I guess.  Yeah, and they were yapping to each other.  They were yapping.  Oh, it was just awful.  Not even sitting in the same seats, and they're yapping each other?  Just turning around.  Shut up.  She's like, oh, I want to smash their faces.  So Jimmy kind of gets my attention, and I turn around, and he goes,  I forget exactly, but he basically says,  you know, how are you feeling?  I'm like, yeah, I'm fine.  Just a little tired, you know.  It was a long two days.  And he goes, yeah, man, I've been fighting this flu for two days, 
[00:14:30]  and I think I've got at least another two days, if not three,  and I just need to get home.  And then he kind of, yeah, I'm really sick.  Dude, like clockwork.  Five minutes tops.  The lady, all of a sudden, she leaves.  I think she's going to get a drink or coffee or whatever in the bar car.  She comes back and goes to the guy next to me.  Okay, I found two seats or whatever.  And they just get up and leave.  Nice.  Because she got completely paranoid that she was going to get sick 
[00:15:00]  from her little passenger friend that she was sitting next to.  I didn't expect her to leave, but I just wanted to make her ride uncomfortable.  Like, I wanted her to think of that.  That's what you get stupid for talking business next to me.  Old typhoid Jimmy sitting next to you.  Oh, it was absolutely great, man.  And you wound up getting a free seat because of that, too, huh?  Yeah, well, at that point, whatever.  Because all the business asses were keeping me awake anyway.  I mean, there were cell phones all around me, man. 
[00:15:30]  I dread the day they allow that on airplanes.  Yeah.  It's happening next year, they say.  They're going to allow that on planes.  You know, when you're on an airplane, you get that.  But it's so much nicer to not have to listen to everyone's goddamn conversation.  It's bad enough before you leave and after you land.  Yep.  And you pull up and everyone breaks out their cell phones to tell everyone they landed.  And that's bad enough.  You just want to crack them in the head. 
[00:16:00]  But could you imagine the whole damn flight, all that ringing going on and the unimportant business conversations?  Why are they allowing that?  I don't know.  Because they want it to be convenient for everybody.  They want it to be convenient.  Look, you could use your cell phone on our airline.  Please help us pay for the $50 a barrel fuel that's going on.  That's what it is.  Right.  They want to make everybody happy so they fly the airline more.  Uh-uh.  That ain't making me happy.  That and babies.  Throw them both off the plane. 
[00:16:30]  Put them both underneath in the baggage compartment.  Nothing worse than paying for a seat and having a kid screaming, crying, because the pressure is changing in their ears and they don't know what the hell is going on.  Yeah, but what's worse about that?  I'll defend the babies in a way.  No, I will.  Because, you know, they can't help it.  For the most part.  What pisses me off is the parents that just assume, ah, my kid's going to cry.  There's nothing I can do about it.  That's what really pisses me off.  On the way down to Washington, on the Accelerator, there was one of those. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  And everyone, one lady's like, Jesus Christ.  She just gets pissed off because it was obvious that the parent was like, ah, kid's going to cry.  Tough crap for everybody on the train.  Not bothering me.  I'm used to it.  You know, and yes, baby's crying in general.  Yeah, it goes right through me.  You're right.  But worse is the parents that just go, ah, oh, well.  Oh, well.  I'm tired and I don't really feel like dealing with this.  So you're all going to have to suffer.  Take the baby for a walk. 
[00:17:30]  Wasn't there a stewardess once that put like a Xanax in the baby bottle?  The mother gave the stewardess a bottle to heat up and noticed that there was some kind of blue specks in it.  Come on.  Yeah.  And she took it and had it analyzed and had the woman arrested.  Because the baby was just screaming the whole flight and annoying everyone on the plane.  So the stewardess crushed up a Xanax and put it in the baby's formula and gives it back to the mother.  Good for her.  What a psychopath. 
[00:18:00]  Should have been a cyanide.  Should have smothered her like the chicken in the last episode of MASH.  That wasn't a chicken.  Well, the kid got cocky.  The kid said, what are you going to do, tranquilize me?  Oh, oh.  Well, I'm a bell.  Yeah, we'll get to that story in a second here.  Let's go to Chicago, say hi to Derek.  Hey, Derek, what's up?  Hey, I was at a truck stop last night.  And this guy's got his kids with him in the truck.  And they're in the adult video games, you know, like the Terry Masters and that. 
[00:18:30]  And this kid was screaming.  I turned around and told him to shut the fuck up and told the father to get the kids out of there.  And I almost got in a fist fight.  I'm tired of the kids in the truck stops.  Yeah, they're yelling and screaming in the truck stops as well, huh?  Yeah, that sucks.  Yeah, I mean, the reality is to the parents out there, you think your kids are cute and all.  Your kids are cute and all to you, your wife or your husband, and some, not even all, of your family members.  That's it.  You can't even fathom how annoying it is when your children start screaming in public places and crying. 
[00:19:00]  You can't even.  And for the parents that really try and they got all their little gadgets and gizmos to shut the kid up, you know, and they're really trying, God bless you.  But to those parents that just let the kids scream and don't even give it a second glance, oh, you should be beaten with your own baby.  Grab it by the little ankles and just beat you over the head with his oversized baby head. 
[00:19:30]  Just because grandma thinks everything your kid does is cute doesn't mean Joe Passenger that's sitting next to you on an airplane thinks it's cute.  He hates your baby and he hates you even more.  The only reason a baby should travel if it's hooking up with a heart transplant somewhere.  That's it.  There's no other reason a baby should be on any type of public transportation.  Stick them in the car seat on your SUV and drive wherever you're going.  All right.  Anthony, it's a very big day today. 
[00:20:00]  Yes, it is.  It is.  It's Groundhog's Day.  Yes, it is.  Would the groundhog see its shadow or it's too early?  What does that even mean?  I don't even know.  Does he see it and it's more winter? 
[00:20:30]  No.  And which dopey DJ will be doing the wacky bit today?  Come on, everybody.  When I was in Buffalo, they were trying to dress me up as some kind of furry creature and they wanted me to come out of a manhole cover, everyone.  And if I saw my shadow, then Buffalo would have what?  Six weeks more of winter or something?  Or 365 days of depression.  What was your name going to be?  Puxatoni Buxley? 
[00:21:00]  Buckley.  If I saw my shadow, I'd get 20 years of being humiliated by my friend.  You saw yourself in the mirror, you'd get 20 years of lost dignity.  I don't know, it's Groundhog's Day and whatever.  I think if the groundhog doesn't see a shadow, it means you get more winter.  Is that it?  So if it's overcast?  So just because it happens to be cloudy on Groundhog's Day, that means there's more winter? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Who the hell came up with this crock of ass?  Archaic.  Oh wait, people think we're cleaning up the show.  Who came up with this crock of shit?  There you go.  All right, there you go.  Let's go to Kenny, who's at the Groundhog Day Festival.  Kenny, what's up?  Nothing much.  I'm at Punxsutawney right now at the Groundhog Day Festival.  You are, and what's it like?  It's pretty weird. 
[00:22:00]  There's a lot of central Pennsylvanians out here just getting weird at 5 in the morning.  And when does the groundhog make its appearance?  At sunrise.  They have a few pre-dawn fireworks festivities.  And then at sunrise, they took a little rat out of a synthetic stump.  And he sees his shadow.  You guys actually have backwards.  He sees his shadow.  It's six more weeks to winter.  Oh, if he sees his shadow, it's six weeks to winter.  He gets scared, and he goes back into hibernation for another six weeks.  Oh, is that it? 
[00:22:30]  So he sees his shadow.  He goes, ah!  He gets scared and runs back in.  And he doesn't come out.  So because he's not coming out, winter lingers a little longer.  Exactly.  You know what would help?  If he pops his head out, and you go over to him with a lawnmower.  He's inside the synthetic tree stump like the one we saw in the movie?  Exactly.  And what do they do?  Is there a big hoopla, like the guy taps it with his cane?  Yeah, there's some old chotch in the top hat.  He's got a clock around his neck like Flava Slave. 
[00:23:00]  And he's going to come out and carry him out and just say if he sees his shadow or not.  No, that's Bill Murray's brother, bro.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  All right.  Well, why don't you call in from time to time and let us know what's going on up there.  Pick up that blood.  As soon as he comes out, I'll let you know whether it's going to be out winter or spring.  Oh, good.  You'll be our reporter from Punxsutawney.  There's actually some good assault on the media attempts over here.  There's cameras everywhere.  But we're going to be signed.  So we're just going to try to run in front of us and say groundhogs or faggots or something. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  Hold on the line because we're going to get your cell phone so we can keep going back to you.  Groundhogs or faggots.  That's hilarious.  You know, it's good.  Even if they tape it, they have to use it because they only do it once.  It's like it'll ruin their shot.  Well, that's Kenny.  We'll go to him from time to time today over there at the Groundhog Festival.  George in Colorado.  What's up, George?  Hey, guys.  Morning.  Morning.  A couple years ago, I took a vacation and I took a train from L.A. to Florida. 
[00:24:00]  And I had to deal with screaming kids the whole fucking way.  And the best one was, we were in Texas.  We had like a two-hour stop.  And I was sitting in the bar car and I got a, my friend that was traveling with me.  Two kids were running around and he looked at me and he said, let's take these kids and see if we can leave them on the platform.  And we tried to get them little kids out of the train onto the platform just before it left. 
[00:24:30]  That's a little extreme.  And the porter saw what we were doing and he told us, he said, as much as I agree with you, you can't do it.  The porter saw, as much as ours agrees with you.  Let me get you a piece of lemon cake, sir.  All aboard!  All aboard!  These kids were, I mean, by the time I got to Florida, I was so tired of little kids.  I'd like to have taken them down to the ocean and pulled them in.  I was just done with them. 
[00:25:00]  I hear you.  All right, George.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  Bye.  It's just the worst.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Max?  No?  You want to try it?  I don't know.  Sometimes that kind of goes away when they talk.  All right, Max, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, Sugar Bridges?  Hi, Max.  Thanks for calling.  Yes.  Me and my wife were at dinner about a year or so ago.  And this little kid just looked right at me, walked up to me with his dad and kicked me right in the shin.  Oh, that's great.  A nice movie moment.  Yeah, I was just looking around for anything, you know. 
[00:25:30]  And I looked at dad and said, you know, what the hell?  And he's like, well, kids will be kids, you know.  Dude, I would have kicked the father right in the shin, man.  Yeah, kick him in the nuts.  That's what my wife told me, dude.  He said, why don't you just kick him and push the kid down or something?  Right.  There was a kid once.  We were eating dinner, nice restaurant.  And this little kid is running around the tables.  That's another thing that parents let their kids do.  Just run like maniacs around places.  And he's running around our table. 
[00:26:00]  He's just going around and then he goes around another table, runs around our table.  And then he'll stop and look at you, like, look how cute I am.  And I'm disgusted.  And the parents are sitting there doing absolutely nothing.  Because they have, you know, three minutes apiece to talk amongst themselves without the kid yapping at him and running around.  So everyone else should suffer.  So the kid's running around.  He gets around one point of my table and I'm seriously thinking of putting my foot out and tripping him.  But I figured the kid would rat me out, you know.  You should have just kicked the kid in the liver. 
[00:26:30]  That usually takes care of all problems.  Where did my little child go?  He's gone.  He doesn't look very well.  He's a little yellow today, I think.  He's got the jaundice.  He's running around the table.  And I seriously, dude, I thought of tripping him.  But I thought he'd rat me out and say, hey, man, trip me.  And then, you know, you've got a problem.  So I put my water at the edge of the table.  And as he came around, I knocked my water glass onto the floor and stood up and went, hey, hey, hey. 
[00:27:00]  You set up a kid?  Totally set him up.  And then the parents were like, get over here.  Come here.  What did you do?  Apologize to that man.  And the kid knew he didn't do it.  He knew it.  But even if he said, I didn't do it, it's not like I tripped him and he fell down.  And he's on the floor and he's blaming me for tripping him.  You didn't get the kid beat, did you?  I don't know.  I don't care.  I wish he would have cracked him right in the head in front of me.  And then the kid had to come up and apologize to me as I'm sitting there.  You've got to feel like an idiot.  And I'm looking at the kid smiling going, you know I did that and you didn't have anything to do with it.  And I totally set you up, you little bastard. 
[00:27:30]  You're evil.  How old is the kid?  The kid had to be maybe three, something like that.  But he's running, screaming.  What a jerk you are.  Just screaming, knocking right off the table.  Hey now, hey, hey.  What a jerk.  Why didn't you just commit a murder and plant the knife on the kid so he went to jail for it?  Really, man?  Little Bruno Mogli shoes.  Did you feel all good about yourself?  I felt so good.  My plan had congealed into perfection. 
[00:28:00]  I felt fantastic.  People think I'm evil on this show.  Dude, it was great because the kid's face, he knew he didn't do it.  And I was that evil guy that I was lying.  And if he said he didn't do it, the father would have smacked him in the head and go, don't lie.  Yeah.  I did it.  I'm happy.  I'm proud of it.  You're a jerk.  Fast forward 25 years.  He's on trial for murdering a prostitute.  I knew I didn't spill that water and I got beaten up for it.  So why shouldn't I just go out and do bad things anyway if I'm going to get blamed for them? 
[00:28:30]  That's why I ripped her in three pieces and put her in a dumpster.  Hey, Mark in Oklahoma City.  Spilled water, killer.  Tipped over a cup of water.  Sorry.  Jesus.  I stepped all over that.  I'm sorry, guys.  He's still talking.  I told him, hold on.  He's still talking.  He's still going.  Mark, you've got to start over.  You've got to listen.  We bailed on you for a second there. 
[00:29:00]  Go ahead.  Sorry about that, guys.  Anyhow, I was at the DMV the other day getting license plates for my pickup.  And these little Mexicans, I guess there's no word in Spanish for babysitter.  Because every time I see the Mexican people, they've got like three or four frigging kids.  They've got the wife and the aunt and uncle and all this shit.  And this little seven-year-old boy was running around playing grab ass with his sister where they have the lines with the ropes and all that junk.  Oh, yeah.  And this guy was standing there, just some guy. 
[00:29:30]  I don't know.  He's probably about 22, 23.  He had like tattoos all over his arm.  Had his nose pierced and all that shit.  And this little boy came up and hit him in the leg.  The guy turned around, looked around, and kicked this little boy right in his ass and sent him flying.  I mean, he probably flew about four or five feet, landed on his face, got to start crying.  I'm thinking, oh, crap.  There's going to be some sort of big deal about this.  A couple people around started clapping.  Oh, great.  See? 
[00:30:00]  That's the way to do it.  Hey, Mark, I've noticed patterns on this show.  You call a lot.  But the problem is, every time you call in another city, you're a trucker, I guess, huh?  Yeah, I'm in Oklahoma City right now, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Sorry about that.  No, usually I figure out the regulars.  Wow.  But what's throwing me off with you always is it's Mark from another city.  I had a question for Jimmy real quick, though, if that's okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, Jimmy, the other day, my friend and I were talking, and he mentioned to me that you point out a lot of things that might mean you're bisexual. 
[00:30:30]  And I asked him, I said, do you think he's bisexual?  And he said, yeah, he could be.  Punch down, Maverick.  Did you just try to get me with my own interview style, sir?  That was awful.  If I didn't have to paw through my instant replay, I'd play a car crash.  That was horrendous.  But my templates, once again, are missing because that's become the customary thing to do. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, don't worry about it there, Eric.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  I'll figure it out.  No, sir, I'm straight.  I like girls.  If a girl happens to have a penis, well, who's looking?  Tim from California.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Tim.  Hey, I got one complaint with the show.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hey, man, I'll pay $3 a month.  You guys switch your times from 10 to 2.  That put us guys out here in California from 7 to 11.  Yeah.  You guys can even have people call up doing nooners and shit. 
[00:31:30]  I don't know, man.  I would love middays.  Oh, would I love middays?  Well, we know there's a problem as far as the West Coast getting to hear this show live,  so we're thinking.  We're doing some thinking.  We're doing some thinking.  That's all I can tell you right now.  Hey, I got an idea for an expert.  No, dude, we're done with you because you tricked us.  I mean, it's fine.  You had a problem with the California thing, but you tricked us.  That's not what you wanted.  How did he trick us?  He had something else to talk about, which is fine.  I mean, we understand there's a problem as far as the West Coast goes. 
[00:32:00]  I mean, they're really not up to listen to the show live.  We're thinking of things.  Big Worm, the trucker.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, I got a story for you.  I was sitting at a truck stop at a McDonald's, and this lady was sitting behind me with about  five kids, and I'm sitting there minding my business, trying to eat.  You know, I've been driving all day, and her little kid kept turning around and messing  with my ear.  I kept brushing his hand away, trying to be nice, and finally, it got to be so aggravating. 
[00:32:30]  I turned around, and I told him, I said, you know what?  I said, I've been to prison, and he just looks at me.  He says, why?  I said, for killing an effing kid.  The lady got irate.  She turned around and started running her trap, and I told her.  I said, dude.  I said, you've got to get a hold of your kids.  I said, this is ridiculous.  They're sitting there messing with me.  I've been driving all day.  I said, you're sitting there just letting them do what the hell ever. 
[00:33:00]  I said, get a fucking hold of them.  And needless to say, she got really irate, stormed out of McDonald's, but you know, it's  ridiculous.  And I just can't believe how people let their kids be in public.  Yeah, they need a little boot in the ass sometimes.  So, sir, you went from being polite and allowing it to saying that you went to prison for murdering  a child.  Not a lot of middle ground with you, is there?  You should hang out with Anthony.  I just want to let you guys know, I'm a converted Howard Stern listener. 
[00:33:30]  Dude, you guys are great.  He's such big ones.  Thanks, man.  Well, the big difference, we're still doing a radio show, and he has chosen not to.  So, thank you, Big Worm.  Thanks.  All right, fellas.  He was real good when he was doing a show.  Gunk from Old Bridge, New Jersey, wants to straighten up the groundhog thing.  He says, if Ben's hog sees its shadow, we get six more weeks of big duties.  That's what Gunk from Old Bridge is saying.  All right, we'll step aside for a quickie.  Where's our coffee, man?  It's good to be back in New York, by the way. 
[00:34:00]  Our little Ben is still in D.C., huh?  Yeah, he's taking more meetings.  Are they goofing on him?  He's insane.  Or is this real, that he's got real live meetings?  I think he's, uh...  I can't.  I think he just didn't want to get up early today.  He's like, you know what?  I'm going to take more meetings.  Is that it?  Oh, pfft.  Because you know he doesn't have to be up for the show.  Right.  So he's got to be up for meetings, but they don't start their meetings until late.  Yeah, nah.  He's playing hooky today, pretty much.  Wow, that's a great scam.  It's a great, great scam. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Found something else that we used to play, Anthony.  Remember Delta Ebonics?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we love this fake commercial.  When we come back, we've got to talk about what's going on in the news.  A lot of big stories today.  Big, big stories.  They fired some people over the tsunami song.  Yes, they did.  We'll get into that.  Who did they fire?  Stay tuned.  We'll tell you.  And Yogi Berra is suing, I don't know, Sex and the City for $10 million. 
[00:35:00]  $10 million, and the Pope.  Why?  The Pope's dying, and he's in the hospital.  He's getting the world's prayers.  Don't write him off yet.  Sure, he looked a little goofy launching that dove the other day, but that was awful.  All right, we'll get into all that in a few minutes.  Y'all be going on vacation?  See, the thing is, if you about to be up off this bitch, check it.  Peep Delta.  We be flying all over this bitch.  Let me ask you something.  You fend to raise up and get your travel on? 
[00:35:30]  From the interior to the exterior, you've got to get your posterior in one of these big-ass planes.  $10, dog.  You lay in the cut straight sitting on your ass and getting your drink on and your snack on  while we floss and fly this mofo all over this bitch.  East Coast, West Coast, it don't matter.  Nia, we'll get you to your hoe and back lickety splits.  No $10.  Then you'll be back at your crib chilling with a flat spliff.  Thinking we were some crazy-ass angel. 
[00:36:00]  Hell, these fat, round, thick-ass vessels run up in the sky so deep, it beat crying.  Yeah, you thought it was rain.  So bring a towel, because at Delta, it's laid out like that.  Call one of these fly-ass Delta coochies.  And make all them punk-ass co-workers of yours catch the vapors as you be off and about.  You going?  We fly you there.  You been?  We done already flew up in there.  We got you covered like a Jimmy hat.  At Delta, we loves us some flying. 
[00:36:30]  And it be showing like a motherfucker.  In a starchy world, mired in imperfection.  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel, but for some reason at this place, they put it like on the grill.  One man.  It's all about me, me, me.  No challenge.  The status quo.  They don't have a toaster?  That annoys me.  Navigating treacherous terrain.  There's crap all over it.  Like I'm seeing grease.  Confronting the unknown.  And there's something green on it, which could be a pepper or a booger. 
[00:37:00]  It's awful.  With a platoon of interns.  You sheep.  And military precision.  Go, go, go.  Fix it.  The world will witness a revolution.  Bagel diva.  Coming soon.  Come on.  To a bakery near you.  Are you kidding?  First of all, white people, when I say Mexican, let's get it right off the bat.  I mean Mexican from here.  Okay, you understand that?  A Mexican from here.  There's a fucking difference.  There's two kinds of Mexicans, white people. 
[00:37:30]  Two fuckers, two.  White people, you think there's only one kind of Mexican?  Au contraire.  No.  There's fucking two.  There's us.  English speaking, articulate, and a very intricate part of the fabric of American society.  That is who you see here tonight, okay?  Okay.  You seem to confuse us for that fucker in front of Home Depot.  Hold the fuck up, papa. 
[00:38:00]  That's not me, fucker.  No, no, no.  That fucker who cuts your grass cuts our grass, too.  He does a better job at our house because we tell him in Spanish.  All right, and sometimes he's family.  Like some people are like, we don't know, what do you mean, Karloff? 
[00:38:30]  We don't get it.  There's two kinds of Mexicans.  Oh, yeah, like there's two kinds of white people.  Don't act ignorant, fuckers.  Yeah, there's you white people, then there's redneck trailer trash.  You know exactly what the fuck I'm talking about.  Oh, now you know, don't you?  You've seen them all.  I've been to Kmart.  You know that skinny-ass trailer trash that has no ass?  It looks like just a leg coming out of some Daisy Duke shorts. 
[00:39:00]  You know, you think she's wearing shoes and you get clothes?  Oh, my God, that's her foot.  Jesus Christ.  How do you get a callus that thick on your foot?  Oh, my God, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, right? 
[00:39:30]  We're up to Wednesday already?  Already Wednesday.  Wednesday, that's the one good thing about the Washington trip.  You come home?  It's the middle of the week.  And then we do a couple days, and then we have to take off to New Orleans.  New Orleans.  We got the New Orleans info in front of us.  How about that?  See, that's why we need Ben here.  And I like the idea that we're doing afternoons.  Yeah, we're doing Monday and Tuesday from New Orleans, Bourbon Street, 3 to 6 Eastern Time. 
[00:40:00]  Yep.  I forgot the name of the place, even though I read it a million times while we were in Washington.  The Crazy Horse.  Ah, the Crazy Horse on Bourbon Street.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  And it is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday today.  Anthony, real fast.  What's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday?  Oh, wow.  People are hearing us in very warm climates right now.  Yes, where wow would just be running rampant.  What you do is you put a wow on your vehicle, W-O-W, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  We have stickers. 
[00:40:30]  You can get one if you send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the address that Opie will now give you.  111, West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019, I think.  Don't know the zip.  That sounds good.  Fifth Floor, XM Radio, Opie and Anthony, Attention Wow sticker.  That's good enough.  Some kind of combo like that.  Something like that.  I think the address is up on opieandanthony.com.  Oh, you're right.  It is? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Then you put the wow.  Could be the sticker.  Could be something you make.  Just W-O-W.  Put it on your vehicle somewhere.  If you drive one of those big rigs, you just scratch it in the dirt on the back door of your truck.  And then if a girl is so inclined, she will drive up next to you and flash her lovely breast.  It's like a little code thing on your vehicle.  W-O-W.  And it lets the girls know that listen to this program that you can flash their boobies.  And Anthony, Michael from E-L-Y-N-I-A, Ohio, did just that. 
[00:41:30]  I got his self-adjust stamped envelope right in front of me.  Are you going to stuff that envelope right now?  Look at me.  Live on the air?  Look at that.  Stuffing it.  Oh.  And sending it off to good old Michael.  Don't lick it.  Huh?  Let someone do that with a sponge.  You don't know what the hell they're putting on those things.  Yeah, you should have rubbed his bag on it.  That's what I would do.  LSD.  There's LSD on acid on there.  Don't lick the envelopes. 
[00:42:00]  You get effed up with acid.  So one of those cold case file shows last night?  You ever watch that?  Yeah, of course.  Had some girl that was murdered when she was, I guess, 13 years old.  Murder went unsolved for 11 years.  They had DNA of some sperm on her leg.  And they saved that.  And, you know, DNA processing leaps and bounds over the past few years.  So 11 years later, they had a suspect, but they needed DNA from him.  They send him a fake letter from a law firm saying that there's a class action suit and this guy's got money coming to him. 
[00:42:30]  Sent him an envelope to send back, stamped, ready to go.  Just got to put some information in the envelope and send it.  He licks the envelope, sends it back.  They cut the part out that he licked, get a DNA sample off of that, matched it.  It was a match.  Arrest him.  Is that illegal, though?  I know.  Well, it came up in court that it was some kind of illegal thing that the cops did to get him.  But they went with the prosecution.  Why not just send a Girl Scout over? 
[00:43:00]  She can come back with a semen sample on her.  In her cookie box.  So wow is happening.  Get the wows on your car and join the fun.  That is Whip About Wednesday.  Okay?  Absolutely.  Jimmy was pointing out a story in the paper that he wants to get into.  This is beautiful.  Is this the G.I. Joe doll?  No, no, no.  Another story from Iraq, though.  Page two of the Daily News.  Okay.  Handicapped bomber outrage in Baghdad. 
[00:43:30]  Insurgents used a mentally handicapped child as one of the suicide bombers who launched attacks on Iraq's election day,  the country's interior minister said yesterday.  A handicapped child was used to carry out a suicide attack on a polling site.  Fa-la-ha-ha said, this is an indication of what horrific actions they are carrying out.  He gave no other details, but police of the scene of the Baghdad blast Sunday said the bomber appeared to have Down syndrome.  Oh, no. 
[00:44:00]  And the funny thing is that off the air, I read that, and I was like really outraged, and Anthony goes, now they're thinking.  Well, you know, you don't want to use up your resources of people that could plan these things and think ahead.  You want somebody that, and there's no fear there.  You just kind of strap the explosives on them and tell them, you know, you press the button, candy comes out.  And he can walk up, hit the button, and then it's over so quick, all you see is that fat tongue shoot out the front. 
[00:44:30]  The mowig goes straight up.  Mission accomplished.  Oh, my God.  So it's not like, you know, I mean, there's really no fear there.  You tell him you die, you go meet Allah, you get 70 colorful balloons.  If you die, he probably doesn't even die.  He probably just stood there and went, uh-oh, and black smoke poured out of his dumb shirt.  Uh-oh, made poopy.  Too stupid to even die.  Is this a real thing that's happening, or is this the weekly world news? 
[00:45:00]  Daily news, dude.  How many times have they used these Down syndrome?  Not enough.  His face gets all blackened, and his shirt collar peels back like a banana.  In the next scene, he's fine doing it again.  Sure.  Are you using cartoon logic on me?  Well, I'm thinking perhaps you could use them over and over again.  The police said that he appeared to have Down syndrome.  Yeah.  How bad is your Down syndrome when it's apparent after you've blown yourself up?  That's a bad case of D to the S. 
[00:45:30]  D to the S.  A little taste of this, in honor of that fine story that Jim just found.  There's a bunch of retards singing.  Down syndrome, children.  You better watch out of the incest to get you.  You better watch out of the incest to get you. 
[00:46:00]  You better watch out of the incest to get you.  You better watch out of the incest to get you.  All never watch out of the incest to get you. 
[00:46:30]  You better watch out of the incest to get you.  You don't see the things you tell you are  All over your body  Bugs are in the streets  And now I gave you  You better watch out for the incense against you 
[00:47:00]  You better watch out for the incense against you  Let quit all the smoke dust  Must eat all  Cool, so let's go  You better watch out for the incense against you 
[00:47:30]  You better watch out for the incense against you  You better watch out for the incense against you  Flies will try to steal your food  We don't like them  They're disgusting  You better watch out for the incense against you  Yes, and we win  Yes, you know that 
[00:48:00]  You better watch out for the incense against you  You better watch out for the incense against you  You better watch out for the incense against you  We gotta watch out!  The governor doesn't wear a 
[00:48:30]  Can I point out the... 
[00:49:00]  Yes, Jimmy, sorry.  No, no, that's okay.  We haven't played that song in a long time.  It was fantastic.  That's one of our faves of all time.  There really has not been this much attention paid to a retarded bomber  since Vossel won Last Comic Stand.  I'm just picturing, like, March of the Wooden Soldiers, you know?  They're just waddling toward their targets.  No, that way. 
[00:49:30]  He runs back to them and hits the button.  No, go that way.  B-Man, what's up, B-Man?  Oh, man, first of all, I got the whole claw on these Mongoloid bombers.  That's why they're wearing the turbans on their heads, to hide the giant foreheads.  Second of all, you fucking guys are killing me with these songs.  I'm going to eat this shit for the rest of the day.  Yeah, that'll be stuck in your head all day long, definitely. 
[00:50:00]  Definitely.  All right, well, that's a cute little story that Jimmy found.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Page two of Daily News.  Front page of all the New York papers, everyone's concerned about the Pope.  Pope crisis.  Prayers for Pope.  Rushed to hospital with breathing problems.  And Daily News, prayers for Pope.  Breathing problems.  Hospitalized.  Pontiff.  Guy's been hospitalized a thousand times already.  He was ancient.  What I found interesting on the news today, are we allowed to talk about the Pope without  getting maybe fired if we say the wrong thing? 
[00:50:30]  You never know in radio these days, you know?  But they're saying that prayer's coming in from around the world and everyone's hoping  for a speedy recovery.  Yeah.  You got to think that maybe they're not hoping for a speedy recovery.  You think the Vatican wants a new Pope?  I think it would help their cause if they got a younger guy in there at this point, right?  I mean, this guy can't even release a dove anymore the right way.  I mean, that video is just unbelievable.  They show him releasing this peace dove from his window and he lets the thing go. 
[00:51:00]  They got a still picture that is just horrific.  His tongue is hanging out.  His face is completely distorted and his arms are flailing because I guess he just released  this thing and it winds up turning around, flying right back through the window and scaring  the Pope out of him.  He's just completely petrified.  And then shortly after that, he was taken to the hospital.  He had his tongue out of his mouth as he was releasing the dove, which just shows he 
[00:51:30]  had to really concentrate on the act.  Yeah.  Because that's what you do when you have that tongue sticking out of your mouth.  Unless you're a suicide bomber over there.  Yeah.  You're just concentrating extra hard is what it is.  But I don't know.  I'm thinking that maybe they would want a younger guy in there.  Here's a guy that's been doing it since, what, 79, 78, somewhere around there?  For PR reasons, absolutely you want the younger Pope in there.  If you remember when this Pope first got into office, whatever they call that, he did a 
[00:52:00]  tour of the world.  And I remember him coming to the United States.  He came to New York.  I guess he spoke at Madison Square Garden.  And the crowds were huge.  And it really kind of boosted, it boosted membership, I guess you'd call it.  Membership in the...  A lot of people went over to the...  Membership in the cult.  Catholic religion after he came over.  I remember them selling t-shirts.  It was like a rock star was showing up, you know, because he was relatively young then.  He was the young Pope.  You know, I was at church recently. 
[00:52:30]  I mean, I was brought up Catholic.  And I'm having a tough time with it in general.  But I was at church recently, and you can't help but think it's a form of a cult.  Everyone just lining up to receive the body of Christ, and they're just chanting, and there's  a whole way of doing it, and then step to your left.  Step to your left after you receive.  All religions are cults.  Yeah.  One way or another, they're all cults.  It's something...  There's no proof of it.  It's totally based in faith. 
[00:53:00]  And there are rituals and things that you have to do.  So, yeah, there's nothing, no difference between a cult and organized religion.  Is this true?  Let me go to...  I don't know his name, but he has something to say from Long Island.  Long Island guy, what's up?  Yes, good morning.  How are you guys?  Morning.  What's up, sweet tits?  How are you?  Just eating a little breakfast, trying to have some fun today.  Yes, how are you?  Listen, you know when a bird flies into your house?  Anthony, you can back me up an old Italian proverb.  You're dead.  Somebody's dying in the house.  That's true. 
[00:53:30]  It's a bad omen.  Yeah, totally bad omen.  So, you know, I think the popper is on his way.  Interesting.  Well, I just thought it was interesting that people are praying for a speedy recovery all  around the world.  I don't know, man.  You know, the pope knows where he's going.  He has complete faith.  Yeah.  He's probably ready to go.  And I think, as far as the Catholic religion goes, it might be helpful to have a younger  guy in there at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah, you get a younger guy in there.  He could start touring the world again.  Doesn't have to, you know, when the pope tours, they put him in that thing. 
[00:54:00]  You either carry him around or let him drive that popemobile around.  It's, and they don't even do that anymore.  No.  So, you know, I think it would help out the Catholic Church if they got a new pope in  there.  And how do you get a new pope?  Well, this pope dies.  And then, what, do they look at cardinals?  They have nominees or something.  And then, uh...  Is Simon going to, like, help decide?  Like, American Idol auditions for a new pope?  Pope Idol.  That would be the best.  What business do you have even being here? 
[00:54:30]  You look ridiculous with that red hat on.  Come out, yeah.  Yeah, I want to be pope.  Yeah.  No, they gather in a room.  Yeah, they could have the American Idol judges gather, and then the smoke puffs out of the  chimney when they make a decision.  And you have a new pope.  Well.  I don't know.  Well, that's a huge story, and we're following that closely here on the Opie and Anthony program.  I like seeing the two different headlines on the papers today, on the New York Daily News 
[00:55:00]  and the Post today, because Pope Crisis is the big headline with the Daily News and Newsday,  but New York Post decided to go with Yogi Berra's $10 million sex suit.  The Post stinks.  The Post.  Just this sensationalist crap.  You know, the Post is barely a newspaper at this point.  You know?  Not that the Daily News is much better here in New York.  I mean, we don't have a real newspaper in New York anymore.  No.  Because then you've got to go all the way to the other side with the New York Times, which  they just, you know, they just try to show how cool they are with all their big words. 
[00:55:30]  Oh.  The Post is the worst.  I'm surprised today they didn't have a mongoloid bomber with a dynamite over it.  Right.  That's the picture of him staring off stupidly.  You know, I understand you've got to sell papers and stuff, but when there's a story  as big as the Pope possibly on his way out, and you choose to go with the Yogi Berra story,  you've got a problem somewhere. 
[00:56:00]  Yogi Berra sex in the city lawsuit.  Yeah, Berra yogasm is worth $10 million.  He wants $10 million for this.  Sex and the yogi.  No way, says Yankee legend Yogi Berra.  The Hall of Famer is suing Turner Broadcasting System for $10 million, claiming his moniker  was tainted when it was used in a racy ad for Sex and the City.  Berra is fuming that his name was an answer to a multiple-choice question asking for a  definition of a yogasm.  Do you know what a yogasm is, Anthony?  I am proud to say I have no idea because I've never watched that awful show. 
[00:56:30]  That horrible, horrible Girls That Think They're Hot show.  Ugh.  Well, and every girl in Manhattan is now thinking they're, like, as cool as the girls from Sex  and the City, by the way.  You wouldn't give one of those slobs a second glance if they walked by you in the city.  You absolutely wouldn't.  I saw what's-her-name, Kim Cattrall and Mario Cantone walking down the street, and Mario  looked better.  What are you trying to say, Noah?  Mario's kind of cute. 
[00:57:00]  What are you saying, Noah?  All right, well, yeah, it was a multiple-choice question asking for a definition of a yogasm.  Choice B was Sex with Yogi Berra, and he's outraged by this.  That's it?  That's the whole basis of the lawsuit?  Yeah, he's outraged.  Because they said yogasm.  Yogi.  That's...  And his was, like, one of the wrong answers.  Yeah.  Choice B was Sex with Yogi Berra.  Wrong answer.  The correct answer was C, what Samantha has with a guy from yoga class. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, she's such a whore slutbag.  Oh, it's so funny.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Ah, you see the one where Samantha gets a mouthful of AIDS and dies?  I loved that episode.  What a whore.  I tell you, those gals, those gals, those gals give it as good as any guy, though.  I'll tell you, you don't want to get on their bad side.  No, no.  Berra is a married man and his children and...  Berra is a married man and has, sorry, children and grandchildren.  He is deeply a religious man who has maintained and continues to maintain a moral lifestyle 
[00:58:00]  and has a spotless reputation for integrity, decency, and moral character.  He's like Superman.  Wow.  Can Yogi Berra just stop and relax?  Who cares?  It's, you know, his name is part of our, um...  It's Americana.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't worry, don't worry, no one wants to have sex with you, okay?  Look in the mirror.  No one's gonna, like, confuse having sex with you. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Your name fits.  Ever.  Oh, thank God Sex and the City, though, is on on TBS and stuff, because, uh, you know,  seeing nude chicks, uh, wasn't the only reason to watch that show.  Well, TBS, they cut all that out.  Cut the cursing out.  Anything that might have been, and like I said, I wouldn't have sat for three seconds to watch  this show, even when it was on HBO.  But now you take it.  It's like, I think, um, was it A&E just won the rights to rebroadcast The Sopranos? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Why bother?  You're watching The Sopranos because it's not on television, on regular TV that can't,  uh, say, uh, uh, the F word, or any, or, or show graphic violence.  Yes?  Eric?  Uh, they announced, uh, yesterday that the A&E reruns, they have alternate scenes that  they're putting in that were already shot, that they're gonna replace certain scenes  during the day, but after 10 o'clock, they're gonna show the originals.  But without any editing. 
[00:59:30]  With the violence and everything, without any editing.  Language violence.  Like, uh, like the F and the S bombs, but other than that.  But they got it.  That's what I'm talking about.  It's the gritty realism in their language that people enjoyed watching The Sopranos.  If they put The Sopranos on NBC when it first came out, it would probably have been gone,  uh, you know, first couple of years.  It needs that.  And also, they say, freaking?  Yeah.  I hate that.  When you see all those cool movies on regular TV.  Oh, you freaking, oh. 
[01:00:00]  Stop.  You mother faker.  Oh.  They say mother faker?  Oh, yeah.  Mother faker.  Huh.  Someone has a problem with us.  Let's say how to Mario in Virginia.  Mario, I don't need you to shoot.  Hey, if I remember correctly, you guys weren't that tough talking about the girls from, uh,  Sex and the City when you had, uh, just, uh, Sarah Jessica Parker on the phone with you.  What?  Good point.  She did smash us pretty good.  Well, we were humbled.  We were humbled?  I think we still said she looked like Ruth Buzzy.  Yeah, we, uh, I don't know. 
[01:00:30]  I would have to listen to that interview again.  It is a great little story for the new listeners.  Anthony and I were talking about, uh, Sarah Jessica Parker.  She was, uh, hosting some award show.  MTV, um, I forgot.  Movie awards.  Okay.  And we went on the air the next day and said, wow, doesn't she look like Ruth Buzzy in a dress?  She does.  She looks a lot like Ruth Buzzy used to look, you know, that just kind of a, kind of a horse  face, you know, and I'm sick of people thinking that she's a sex symbol.  She's not that hot.  No.  So we, we said all this on the air and, and all of a sudden there's a phone call and it 
[01:01:00]  says, uh, Sarah from, uh, New York, I guess, or whatever.  Yeah, she was calling from a cab.  And, um, was it a cab?  Yeah, because one of our cab driver friends, I guess, had had our show on in the cab.  No, no, well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Maybe she was calling from a cab, but how the story goes is, uh, she was, she was in  her trailer getting makeup or whatever for the show when they were filming and the guy  in there was a huge fan of the show and had it on.  Wow.  I heard the cab thing. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, really?  Wow.  Now we got to get to the bottom of this.  I remember it as she was in a cab and she called from the cab because she had heard us  goofing on, because she called right away.  It wasn't one of those things where she called hours later.  Yeah.  She called as we were goofing on her.  I thought she was calling from the set.  Hmm.  I don't know.  A little controversy here.  I remember it as a cab.  A little controversy.  I believe it was a cab.  I've heard the replay.  I wasn't in at that point.  I believe it was from a cab.  I got this one real wrong, huh?  Our lunatic listeners would know also.  Yeah, they'll figure it out.  Chime in.  They'll figure it out.  We'll have an answer to that.  But basically, uh, she heard the whole rap of us, you know, saying how ugly she was 
[01:02:00]  and this and that.  And then she like, she goes, I bet you guys are nothing special to look at.  And then she gave us an invite to come down to the Sex and the City set so we could show  our faces so she could ridicule us.  And we're like, fine, we'll go.  But then we were going to like send like, I don't know, models with roses and stuff.  Yeah, we were going to send like male models down there.  Hi, how are you?  I'm Opie and Anthony.  I'm Opie and this is Anthony.  How are you?  We are perfect.  Look at our abs. 
[01:02:30]  Very funny.  And, uh, but the difference is, um, I don't try to portray myself as a sex symbol like  these old, like, like Kim Cattrall.  I'm sorry.  I don't see it.  She puts these dresses on at these award shows.  She has square Lego tits.  You seen them?  She gets put in these dresses.  Her tits are flat on the bottom square.  This bunt is hanging out from our dress.  She, you know, maybe when she was, uh, uh, Lassie. 
[01:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  In Porky's.  Remember Porky's?  Oh, yeah.  She was the one that was, uh, screaming and howling as Lassie.  Oh, I don't remember.  Yeah.  She was the moaner in that movie and she wasn't that hot in that movie when she was younger.  No.  What made that so hot was the sound she was making.  She was also fully nude.  They showed full frontal nudity.  She had a big nasty 70s bush going and everything.  That was the groundhog.  Yeah.  Coming out of its hole.  But she was, uh, but you know what it was?  She was younger, you know, a little tighter. 
[01:03:30]  Now it's just, I'm tired of these old broads parading around on television with everyone  thinking they're hot.  It's, you know, maybe some older guys are looking and, you know, in front of their wives, they  don't want to look at, you know, turn on the OC and start looking at those girls because  they look like perverts looking at it.  Yeah.  Turn on an episode of Smallville and look at them, you know?  You know, it's, it's, you know, maybe it's safe for them to go, hey, that's an attractive  girl and that's about as far as they can go, you know?  But, uh, I don't see it. 
[01:04:00]  Well, the end of the story.  So, uh, we, we kept calling her people.  I mean, she gave us all sorts of phone numbers, you know, we were definitely going to do this  and go down there and say, what the hell?  We'll take our beating.  She could smash us.  And then, uh, turned out that she kind of blew us off.  Yeah.  She wasn't brave enough to actually face us on the set.  Mm-hmm.  Know what happened there?  I think she was, but her people got to her and said, you know, do you really want to  be, you know, you know, socializing with a couple of shank tanks? 
[01:04:30]  Do you really want to be seen hanging out with a couple of shank tanks?  Two, uh, two emails coming in.  Yes, Anthony.  She called from her freaking trailer.  I'm telling you.  And the other one, I have the MP3.  It was from a cab.  So, damn it.  Uh, wait, she was in a cab.  I heard it.  I listened to that show a few days ago.  I think she called from a limo.  She was in a cab.  Yeah.  That's the beauty.  Opie's right.  I have an MP3 of it.  Opie's right.  Ant's wrong.  She was on set.  She was in a cab. 
[01:05:00]  So, these people have no clue.  That's the beauty of this show.  You hear that guy?  I heard that show last week.  Yeah.  People are listening to our old shows around the world at this point.  You go to OAVirus.com and you can hear all sorts of old stuff that we talk about.  So, you can get caught up if you're a new listener.  OAVirus.com.  It's nice they're listening and no one knows what they're talking about, though.  They're listening.  I know.  I know.  Everyone has no idea what's going on.  It's the same amount of people saying both ways.  And both camps here are saying that they just heard it, have listened to it, and it's on my computer. 
[01:05:30]  I have the audio.  It's from the set.  It's getting crazy.  A lot of people are just downloading our old show, so there are iPods and all sorts of stuff.  OAVirus.com if you want to get caught up.  But, Anthony, you say cab.  I'm saying trailer.  I say cab, yeah.  I remember it as her being in a cab.  Oh.  All right.  Pope Health Crisis.  Breaking news.  Can I tie up this last story before we do that?  Because I just found more information.  On what? 
[01:06:00]  On the retarded bomber.  Oh, yes.  You're obsessed with the retarded bomber.  I love that Jim searches out these stories.  I was wondering why he wasn't talking for the last ten minutes.  This was in the post.  I saw you grab another paper going, I know there's another angle on this story somewhere.  I just do the, it's not much more, just to finish it up.  I got it.  He was 19, he had the mind of a four-year-old.  And people who knew him said he was, he was mindless, but he was mostly happy, laughing  and playing with children.  And the family believes guerrillas seized Amar, loaded him with explosives, and sent him 
[01:06:30]  on his way to the polling place like a guided missile.  But he apparently detonated the bombs before reaching the intended target, and no one was  injured.  So no one got hurt?  No one was injured, except dummy.  That makes me feel better.  Makes me feel better.  Walks into the middle of an open field.  Three butterflies were found dead.  Stupid.  Oh, just big oversized shoes in the middle of the field. 
[01:07:00]  And mess all around it.  Mindless idiot.  Cotton candy by its side.  He was mindless, but happy.  Oh, played with the children.  John in Jersey.  Yo.  Go ahead, John.  What's up?  I know where you talked to Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yeah?  She was in her trailer, but her driver heard the radio station and then told her, and then  she called in.  Oh, boy.  Now we're going to have to get to the bottom of the story, because now it's a thing. 
[01:07:30]  We made it into a thing now.  It's a thing.  All right, John.  Thank you.  All right, thanks.  Now, someone's saying we're both right.  She called twice.  What?  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Someone will figure that out, I'm sure, on one of the message boards.  Let me say.  She called from a trailer.  She called you guys out and asked you to come down to the set.  Yeah, but I think people are being confused that she was on set because she asked us to  come down to the set.  But I don't think she was on the set.  What if she called from her trailer? 
[01:08:00]  That's on set.  Offered to come down to the set.  You offered to ask the O&A Army to bring flowers.  You asked her, is Matthew going to come down and fight us?  It was the day of the roast of Jimmy on the show.  I guess Patrice and Voss were in.  I didn't even think I was a part of the show at that point yet.  Was I really?  I don't know.  I thought it was way before then.  Everyone is completely confused.  It's a developing story. 
[01:08:30]  Why don't we go to break, Anthony, with Team America.  America, fuck yeah.  America, fuck yeah.  America, America.  America, fuck yeah.  Come and begin to save the motherfucking day.  America, fuck yeah.  Freedom is the only way.  Terrorists, your game is through.  Because now you have to answer to America. 
[01:09:00]  America, fuck yeah.  So lick my butt and suck on my balls.  America, fuck yeah.  What you gonna do when we come for you now?  It's the dream that we all share.  It's the whole world to go.  Fuck yeah.  We got a.  Fuck yeah.  Walmart.  Fuck yeah.  We got.  Fuck yeah.  Baseball.  Fuck yeah.  NFL.  Fuck yeah.  Rock and roll.

[01:12:30]  Radio to the power of X.  M202.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Let's go right to the phones and say hi to Eric.  He's got a slight problem with the show.  Go ahead, Eric. 
[01:13:00]  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys that, you know, when you were down in Washington, your levels were great.  You know, when you went to commercial, I had no problems.  Wouldn't blow my speakers up or anything.  Now that you're back in New York, you go to commercial and I just blew two speakers.  Yeah, that's what I was trying to tell the tech guys down there.  We don't get it.  Something is going on, you know.  They're going to work on it.  I guess they're trying to figure it out.  But I was telling them, I got two meters to my right here.  And down in Washington, they were perfect.  Going up and down, up and down perfectly. 
[01:13:30]  And now they're all over the ball field again.  So I don't get it.  I don't know.  They're going to send people down here and work on it.  All right, Eric.  We're working on it.  I've got something else for you guys.  What?  I was down in Chicago the other day to see a little old midget.  Midget?  Yeah.  We're walking around.  Had a big old adult body.  Adult head.  Little Connor Peterson legs.  Yeah, but what was the midget doing?  Just walking down the street. 
[01:14:00]  What did you do?  Blew my horn as I went by.  It scared the shit out of him.  Well, did the person see you?  Hurry up, Anthony, and find it, please.  Yeah.  Please find it.  I'm hard to miss in an 18-wheeler.  All right, so the midget's walking.  Exactly.  Describe the midget.  He's probably, I don't know, about three foot, three and a half feet.  Big head.  Like a full-size, you know, adult body.  Short arms.  And about two foot long legs. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, my God.  I had to score until he found that.  It took forever without the templates.  It took forever.  Jesus.  What were the templates?  What happened to them?  Oh, again, they got lost.  I thought Ben was on the line.  What happened to Ben?  Hope wants Ben, Steve.  Where is he?  I think his phone crapped out, so he's calling back as soon as he gets his service back.  I'm amazed that Ben's even up listening to the program.  Oh, yeah.  His phone fell inside his ear, and he's trying to fish it out.  All right, we want to talk about, I mean, this is just a tragic story that is huge here 
[01:15:00]  in New York.  This very big story.  I guess it's a wannabe actress.  I mean, did she actually do anything?  Was she on any shows?  Aspiring actress.  All right, aspiring actress.  It's about live stage work and stuff.  You guys have heard us talk about this story for a few days now.  Basically, she's out drinking kind of on the Lower East Side, I believe, which we've discussed.  There's trendy places down there.  But in a lot of ways, it's a war zone, man. 
[01:15:30]  It's the plains of the Serengeti.  There's a lot of graffiti and stuff down there, so it's a little scary if you're down that  way at night, especially after the bars close.  These jackasses think they could make these bars, these nightclubs in this area because  it's so chic.  Look at us.  We're putting a bar in the middle of a jungle.  And then what happens?  Whitey staggers out into the plains of the Serengeti to have their throats ripped  out by predators.  It's insane. 
[01:16:00]  You've got to be a mad person to go down there.  I'll stick to TGI Fridays right there in Times Square.  Yep, exactly.  So, you know, it looks like this group of people were probably buzzed coming out of the bar,  safe to say.  It's like 3 in the morning.  They've got a buzz on.  They're stumbling around.  And then a bunch of youths approach.  And a mugging goes on, basically.  And the one girl says, what are you going to do, shoot us?  Or shoot me, or whatever.  And the one guy just goes bang, right in the chest. 
[01:16:30]  She's dead.  Well, he was 19, this scumbag.  And his girlfriend was 14.  14.  That's good.  She's probably pregnant already with his kid.  And they were, the guy and the girl who was shot, they were resisting the mugging.  They didn't take it seriously.  And not that anyone deserves to get shot, but that's really stupid.  That's stupid right there.  Because the guy was like, they were pistol whipping the guy.  And then the girl got up.  And I give her credit for having balls.  But she gets up and she shoves the gunman to leave her boyfriend alone.  And they just start arguing. 
[01:17:00]  And then he pulls out a gun.  And she says, what are you going to do, shoot me?  And he goes to pop the other girl that they're with.  And the gun misfires.  And then he points it at her.  Just an absolute savage.  It wasn't even like a hot moment.  He tried to shoot once.  It didn't work.  And then he consciously pointed at it and shot again.  Shot her in the chest.  She dies right there on the street.  Great.  Wonderful.  And now we find out, gee, and what a surprise this was to me.  He had been in jail before.  19 years old.  He'd already spent, I think, three years in prison for pointing a gun at a cop. 
[01:17:30]  For pointing a gun at a cop.  Three years.  That's all you get.  Hey, any criminals, just come to New York.  Apparently you can do these gun crimes.  And really, it's a drop in the bucket as far as time goes.  You won't really spend that much time before they just let you go.  So you can then kill people.  What I'd like to know is why, again, this type of stuff happens, but why is there not one mention of the fact that the assailants were black and the victims were white? 
[01:18:00]  Like, for instance, if that was a white gang and there were a couple of black teenagers coming out, you know, black actors, and they were assaulted like that.  And pistol whipped and shot.  The racial implications, and you said it off, Karen, before, the marches that would happen, the amount of uproar simply over the racial.  So you're saying if some successful, motivated, ambitious black people came out of a bar.  Absolutely.  And were accosted by a gang of ruthless, animalistic, white youths. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, little skinheads or whatever, little just white dirtbags.  Came out and cut down one of them in their prime, as they say.  Yep.  That there would be all kinds of outrage, that every black leader would get up in arms, that this was a racial incident, that race, a hate crime had been committed.  Hate crime, yep.  And they should be prosecuted as a hate crime, and there would be marches, and there would be people being blamed that there is this climate in the city of hate, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:19:00]  Yep.  You're absolutely right.  And the papers, by the way, not just black leaders, but every paper in the city would be saying the same thing, every newspaper.  Beautiful black actress killed by a white hate group, is what you would say.  But this, it's, ah, you gotta, you know, you gotta just let them do this, because society has crapped on them so long, and they don't have a chance to blah, blah, blah. 
[01:19:30]  More crap.  That is a great example of liberal arrogance, and I know it sounds paranoid of me to say that, but it's almost like they think that blacks are expected to behave like that, so it's not really news.  That's what it is.  It's expected of the blacks, so it's not really news.  Us as white people have to just accept it.  Yeah.  Just take it.  Black people will tend to do this from time to time, and it's not a hate crime or anything, it's just the way they are.  That's what the papers, that's what the black leadership, that's what everyone else is telling us by not saying anything in cases like this. 
[01:20:00]  And no one is saying that she's not getting coverage.  I mean, because when you look at, you know, a perfect example, Shoshana Johnson and Jessica Lynch over in Iraq, not to say white people don't get the proper news coverage.  I'm only saying that, you know, there is a disproportionate amount of it, I think, in white favor.  But I think in a case like this, I'm just sick of the racial implications.  Like Bernard Getz, the first thing that everyone was saying was the racial implications.  None of the guys that were going to attack him because he was a little white guy.  Lily White Gunman, they called him, if you remember. 
[01:20:30]  I don't remember that.  Reading the news stories back then.  He was the Lily White Gunman, I believe is what, you know, Sharpton and that.  What the black leadership, people like Al that was, you know, trying to run for president,  trying to stay out of the controversy these days because he thinks he's a legitimate leader.  People like Jesse Jackson, all the leaders that would have come out up in arms if this situation had been reversed,  should come out and spend all their time trying to find out why in the black community people feel compelled to have guns and shoot each other. 
[01:21:00]  And white people, but for the most part they're shooting each other.  You see stories in the news that we don't even bring up on a daily basis.  The Bronx, East New York and Brooklyn.  It's a battle going on and they're killing each other.  It's this whole mindset of you've disrespected me, if you bump into me, you step on my foot, you make me look stupid in front of my girlfriend.  It's not a smack in the face.  You pull a gun out and you shoot them in the head and you spend, you know, some time in prison, I guess. 
[01:21:30]  Where are the black leaders to get their own people civilized?  There's no other way I could put it.  Well, if you're civilized, your people, if you say something about it, like Cosby has the I think Cosby's an ass and he's been shunned, shunned.  Yeah, because he speaks up and says, hey, go to school, speak properly so you can get a job.  Don't go running around slinging dope and shooting each other.  And believe me, Cosby doesn't care about whitey.  He's not caring if they're going out shooting white people. 
[01:22:00]  But his own son was killed by a white guy, you know, I mean, he he's got to these these black leaders have to address the problem.  And the problem isn't that the society, blah, blah, blah.  It's raising a culture of young blacks that are this that you've got to get your house straight.  You've got to get your shit in line.  These animals prowl in the streets and for no reason shoot a girl in the chest. 
[01:22:30]  And this guy had already been in prison for three years for pulling a gun on a cop.  How do you get out of jail if you pull a gun on a cop?  And the victims handled this abysmally.  Of course, you don't.  Because what happened was this.  He's a guy and he's got his dumb girlfriend there.  I don't care how old she is.  He's got that male thing that he was being embarrassed in front of his girlfriend because they were resisting.  And that's why he pistol whipped the guy.  I think that's and the girlfriend was even starting crap and hitting the other girl.  Yeah.  And then her 14 year old.  Yeah.  Good, good people.  Her parents are saying she's a good girl. 
[01:23:00]  She's just she's a very disobedient child.  Disobedient.  Maybe if you kept your friggin little slut in.  Yeah.  And it wasn't.  She's out at three in the morning.  14 year old out at 3 a.m.  With a 19 year old guy with a gun.  Yeah.  Good girl.  Misguided.  Lock her up.  I'm tired of people trying to rationalize why this happened instead of just punishing these people that are amounting to nothing.  I read the transcripts of this guy's parole hearing and it was nothing but a parole officer sitting in front of this jerk off saying you could be a doctor. 
[01:23:30]  You could be a lawyer.  Go to school.  No, he can't.  He's a killer.  He's a murderer.  It's too late.  Lock him up.  I'm tired that we have to risk our lives walking around.  People that actually contribute to this society have to walk around with these test cases out there because some idiot thinks he's going to turn out to be productive.  It ain't going to work.  Look what happened. 
[01:24:00]  You let him out.  The only difference this time is he fired the gun.  He had one.  He pointed it at a cop.  And he said, oh, of course, I was scared.  You know, the police officer pointed a gun at me.  Yeah, that's his job.  He actually dumped in his pants?  That's what he said.  He said he did something.  He had a little accident.  He had an accident in his pants when the cop pointed a gun at him.  So I guess he was so confused he had to pull his own illegal gun out and point it at the cop.  And he came out, by the way.  Why did the cop shoot him at that point?  Oh, please. 
[01:24:30]  You know why?  I'll tell you why.  Because the cop is probably thinking if I shoot this son of a bitch, I'm going to jail with the climate of society today.  He's thinking if I shoot this, I'm going to be screwed.  They've got to think twice now, these cops.  They're in a bad position.  When Diggins is going to the bedside of shot drug dealers over police officers, he eventually apologized to that cop because the cop was in the right for shooting the guy.  But, you know, cops have this thing where we can't do anything.  And this is not the abuse of L.A. cops.  But when a guy points a gun at you, you're afraid to shoot him because there's going to be an internal investigation and there's going to be problems. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  That's it.  Look at a case like, who's the one that they, you know, Diallo.  Oh.  Oh, well, that was not a good one.  Oops.  Oops.  Yeah.  That wallet could look like a gun if you hold it the wrong way.  And everyone has held their wallet trying to see if it does look like a gun.  Yeah.  Hey, not saying there are exceptions to the rules.  Always.  There are always exceptions.  I'm not saying that there are injustices going on, of course.  But the issue has to be addressed.  There is a disproportionate number of blacks committing violence against other blacks, even. 
[01:25:30]  And why isn't why isn't the black leadership addressing this and doing something about it?  Why are they shunned when they try to blame it on their own community?  Why?  You know who addresses it well?  Although he blames white people a lot.  But Farrakhan is one of the only guys that actually does address it in the black community.  And just say, stop this.  People knock Farrakhan.  But you know what?  He does say a lot of things about it.  He wants to get his house in order.  Yes.  There you go.  Get your house in order. 
[01:26:00]  Please.  All right.  Well, the phones have just exploded.  Let's say hi to George the Trucker.  George, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hey, I got to agree with you on this.  I got a friend of mine a couple years ago that he was involved in an incident in self-defense.  He shot and killed a black kid.  And, I mean, the black community was up in arms.  And, I mean, there were leaders saying, oh, he's so wrong.  He should be prosecuted.  But yet the worst part of it is, it's like four years earlier, he was assaulted by another black guy in a different situation. 
[01:26:30]  And it was like a page 30 story.  But when my friend was involved in the shooting, it was like a page one story.  Well, what were the details that your white friend, you know, shot the black guy?  It was attempted carjacking.  Well, he'd come out of a bar and was getting into his car. 
[01:27:00]  And a guy walked up to him, pulled a knife on him.  And, you know, he wanted the car.  And my friend had a concealed carry permit.  And he drew his, you know, legally owned, legally carried handgun and put one shot into the guy and dropped him.  The poor guy wasn't jacking the car.  He was probably just asking for directions.  I'm sure that's what his lawyer said.  He was so cold that he just wanted a little warmth or something.  It's always something.  There's never any accountability. 
[01:27:30]  Never any responsibility.  It's always a problem.  There's always some reason that they did this.  It's not just a greedy, selfish, uneducated jack-off that wants what's his, what he feels is entitled to him.  And you know what that is?  It's your car.  It's your money.  It's your happiness.  It's your friggin' life.  It's selfish.  Yeah, go ahead.  Hey, do you guys have that story out here in Colorado about that college professor?  Oh, that jerk-off Ward something his name is. 
[01:28:00]  Ward Churchill?  Yeah, yeah.  What's that about?  He made some...  Comments about 9-11.  So here's the deal.  This guy is a professor out here, and on September 12, 2001, he wrote an essay basically comparing the people who were killed in the World Trade Center to little Eichmann.  Called them Nazis.  Called them Nazis.  Called them Nazis.  Nazis, and now the radio stations out here have all been playing little sound bites from press conferences this guy's done and speeches, and I mean, this guy is guilty as sin. 
[01:28:30]  He, if anybody ever deserved a bullet, it was this guy, and this guy is backpedaling so bad, and the truth is coming out about him.  And the worst part is he's supposed to be speaking at Hamilton College there in New York tomorrow.  Yeah.  And there are protests going on about this, and you guys really need to get into this deeper and encourage the ONA army and whatnot to really start a nice... 
[01:29:00]  Unless there's going to be nude chicks down there, they won't go, so...  Dude, I know what you're saying.  Look, this guy to me is a complete scumbag, but I don't like, just because what he said is repugnant, you've got to let the guy speak.  That annoys me when the liberals do it, and now the more conservative voices are doing it.  Yeah, but Jimmy, here's the thing, though, is this guy literally came out and compared everybody who died. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I know he did.  No, we know he said he's a scumbag.  He said there were no innocent victims over there.  He goes, they were all like Nazis.  I understand that, and I don't think maybe a school should be giving this guy a forum to speak.  He has the freedom to say whatever he wants, but if it's on a soapbox on an intersection, because that's all he could get, that's fine, too.  But I don't think schools should be bringing this guy in to give these points of view.  Well, they will bring in guys like that.  The only problem I have with it is they don't bring guys on the other side. 
[01:30:00]  Like, if you're that conservative and you're destroying liberal ideologies or agendas, colleges will protest you the same way they're protesting this guy.  I just don't like anybody's...  As long as you're not encouraging people to go out and commit crimes, if there's a legitimate reason to have him speak, then I'll let him talk.  Yeah, but this guy is encouraging people to commit crimes.  No, he's not.  This guy is actually encouraging the terrorists to attack him.  Dude, you're stretching there.  He's just got a disgusting point of view.  Dude, he's got a disgusting point of view.  I personally would like...  Hey, dude, this guy came out and...  We know what he said. 
[01:30:30]  I know, he called the hijackers gallant and he said they made sacrifices.  I know.  He also said they should do it again.  He has come out and said...  Believe me, I don't think the terrorists need any more encouragement.  I think they're pretty encouraged when they're strapping dynamite to mongoloids.  I think they're pretty motivated.  We're allowed to say I think Bush should nuke him.  This guy's allowed to say I think terrorists should do it again.  As much as I find his opinion repulsive, but I can't be a hypocrite and say I want so-and-so to be able to say what they want and not this guy.  This guy, you know, hopefully this guy will drop dead, but he's got the right to say it. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Thanks, George.  We've got to go back to Pennsylvania, Anthony.  It's Groundhog Day.  Oh.  We're all over the ball field today.  Let's say hi to Teddy.  Teddy, what's going on?  It's about to go down.  They're calling the Pennsylvania show out.  Okay.  I hear the crowd.  Listen to these.  Before the groundhog comes out, we're all waiting.  They're playing like disco favorites and shit.  Listen to these zeros.  They're playing disco? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  I think I saw the 60s DJ dancing.  Holy crap.  There's a live shot on the Today Show.  There's thousands of people there.  There's the fake tree with Phil's name plaque on it.  Pucks a tawny filly.  All the elders there with their hats on, their big oldie time hats.  Did you catch the name of the place?  Phil's shadow can prevent global warming.  Jesus.  All right.  Now, one of the guys, I guess he's got his cane.  Is he going to start tapping on the tree trunk and pull that little rat out? 
[01:32:00]  It's funny if a retarded guy put his head out and just blew up.  Eric, what did you do?  Eric, what did you do?  You stupid Eric.  God damn it.  Jesus.  He changed the channel.  All of a sudden, I'm looking at the Pope, who looks like a groundhog, but the Pope's  always knocking on the door with his cane.  He's knocking on the little groundhog door.  Bunch of flashes going off.  People love this, I guess.  They want a picture of it.  And now one of the guys is reaching in and, oh my God, Phil's dead.  Yeah.  Pull out a dead rodent. 
[01:32:30]  Big rat trap over his head.  Look, it looks like Opie's kitchen.  And they're holding up the groundhog.  They're holding him up.  Ew.  Oh, he's trying to bite the old guy.  Look how pissed off this thing is.  How funny would it be if this old guy just dropped him a heart attack and put everybody?  Well, how about twisting Phil's neck and snapping it in front of the people?  Why is the cop from Dog Day Afternoon holding Pucks at 20?  Give us off drinks.  Give us off drinks.  All right, Teddy, what's going on from your vantage point? 
[01:33:00]  Would you catch the name of the place?  Huh?  You catch the name of the place they're having this?  Gobbler's Knob?  Yes, it's Gobbler's Knob.  Of course.  Everyone knows it's Gobbler's Knob.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right, let's see.  Yeah, I think I saw the 60s DJ dancing the YMCA.  Stick to just reporting what's going on, sir.  Wait.  Did Phil see his shadow?  I think he's seeing it right now.  How do they know?  He just held the stupid thing there.  It looked the same as it did 30 seconds ago.  He asks him. 
[01:33:30]  I believe Phil talks to this guy.  Now he's making his proclamation.  All right, what's the proclamation, Teddy?  We don't have the audio up.  Hear ye, hear ye.  I cannot believe we went live to this.  On TV, I mean.  Yeah, to a guy who's telling us nothing.  Right.  There's real news going on all over the world, but they cut into this.  I know, the Pope threw a groundhog out the window. 
[01:34:00]  All right, we're waiting.  Prognosticator of prognosticators.  I heard it.  Anything, Teddy?  They're still going through a whole lot of BS.  Ugh.  A lot of BS.  BS, BS.  This stinks.  Look at these idiots!  Oh my God, they're out there in the frigid cold.  Can you see it?  Can I see it?  Can you see the shadow?  They haven't said yet.  Uh, they haven't said yet?  Ooh, I'm so excited.  I'm asking some locals. 
[01:34:30]  They say they haven't said yet.  Nope.  People are leaving already, though.  I don't know why.  Good.  Because it stinks.  That's why.  Because they realize that this stinks.  Downpours, floods, landslides.  They just mentioned the tsunami and the landslides.  Yeah, we can hear it if you put the phone there.  They cause much destruction, suffering, and pain.  What?  What? 
[01:35:00]  Why are you talking about the tsunami?  Why are you talking about the tsunami?  Did Puxatawney Delgado write a song about it?  Swim, groundhog, swim!  Wood chips through his head!  Well, I'm sorry to say, I see my shadow in there.  Uh, he sees the shadow.  It's gonna be winter.  It's gonna be winter.  It is winter.  You mean...  It's winter.  Winter continues for another six weeks.  He saw his shadow.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Punch it out.  All right. 
[01:35:30]  If anything else happens, give us a call back, Teddy.  Thank you.  All right, I will.  You guys suck.  One of our faithful listeners up there in, uh, in that place in Pennsylvania that I can't  pronounce.  Puxatawney.  Pronounce, yes.  I hope Puxatawney Phil gets foot cancer.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Phil?  Phil Connors?  Pick up your partner and social media, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, Pennsylvania.  It's the tsunami.  It's harder, it's rather, swim, you bitches, swim. 
[01:36:00]  And watch the screaming jinx.  Everybody hurts for when you're hunting, you're hunting, you're hunting, you're hunting, you're hunting.  It's the Phuket Polka.  Forget your bubbly reception.  Tree right through her head.  Start laughing at your country. 
[01:36:30]  Great.  A radio con queso grande presenta Senor Opie.  Dude, what happened?  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was. 
[01:37:00]  Yes.  Great country music.  Great country music of China.  That album, you know, didn't sell well,  but there were some fantastic country songs in there, like...  Bring me back my bowl of rice, you bitch.  It just didn't go well.  That wasn't a good song.  And it was somewhat offensive. 
[01:37:30]  And this one.  Well, the Yangtze flooded again.  There's blood in my clogs.  And my whole family was crushed by giant logs.  Well, they're damming the river up in the three gorges.  And I might have sex with a pig.  That was a weird song.  I don't really understand, you know... 
[01:38:00]  I don't think the translation was good, though.  It was very bad.  In fact...  I might have sex with a pig.  That's not, you know...  Do you like it?  No, I don't like it.  And who would?  They never call.  And if, by accident, they do call, 
[01:38:30]  a phone has fallen off its hook at the farm,  and they've gotten a duck to poke the numbers,  all you'll hear is...  They're good talkers.  Pigs, they don't care about your personal life.  They don't care about you.  They just take, take, take.  Yeah.  And then we kill them.  Don't they?  I guess they deserve all they can. 
[01:39:00]  So...  Me and Anthony, XM202.  Marco, do you want more?  Cook and roll with the Brooklyn boys.  One last time, I need y'all to roll.  Yeah.  Now, what the hell are you waiting for?  After me, there should be no more.  So for one last time, make some noise.  What the hell are you waiting for?  You're checking out the O&A virus spreading across America. 
[01:39:30]  We're back in New York City.  It's good to be home, I gotta tell you.  Gotta tell you.  Gotta tell you.  I felt like we were separated from our listeners.  We didn't take many phone calls in Washington,  because...  Oh, we had a delay.  Slight delay.  We got some bugs to work out,  because Washington wants us down there from time to time.  They're saying once a month, ain't gonna happen.  I can't sit in those meetings once a month.  No way. 
[01:40:00]  Uh-uh.  I think we got a lot done, though.  Drives me crazy, though.  You know what's great about Washington?  We discovered a lot of new freaks for the radio show.  You got the Mad Mexican.  Mad Mexican's great.  He's gonna be on the show from time to time.  We got Deedee with a weird voice.  Deedee, cartoon voice.  And then we got that fast-talking DJ that's just outrageous,  because he's been fired a lot.  I forgot his name already.  We're the 60s station guy.  Yeah, from the 60s channel.  Dude, he read an email over the air about something. 
[01:40:30]  I know.  What are you thinking, man?  You know, we're crazy.  Anthony and I downplay what we do,  but is he insane to try to impress us  by saying that he got fired for reading an email  that he wasn't supposed to read on the air?  Let me tell you what I did.  We did that on our first day together,  Anthony and I, basically.  I mean, does he understand the stuff we've done?  Apparently not.  I was like, yeah.  Oh, wow.  You did that?  Wow.  All right.  What do we want to get into? 
[01:41:00]  I guess we've got to end the whole tsunami story.  Can I point out one thing before we do  that ties in with the old story to finish it up?  Yeah.  I have to just point out how stupid Bob Kelly is  because I forgot to tell you before.  We were talking about the girl shooting last night  with the whole thing we just covered.  The thing, yeah.  And Bob was saying about how she comes to New York  and she's trying to be an actress.  And then you try to make your dream come to fruition.  He said, fruition.  He's the stupidest human being I've ever met.  I had to get that out. 
[01:41:30]  Bob makes Voss look like Stephen Hawking.  Are you kidding?  Bob is a dummy.  You're not going to get that.  Wow.  That's not a right to me.  That's not a right to me.  That is stupid.  The foolishness.  They should take both of them,  strap explosives to them,  and try to send them to a polling place.  They blow each other up.  Anthony, what do you got in front of you?  The tsunami thing?  No, this was some wrong alert.  Tell state to evacuate.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Connecticut was in a panic, what, yesterday?  We've got to get the audio of that. 
[01:42:00]  Man.  Despite what residents may have seen on television,  the state of Connecticut was not ordered to evacuate Tuesday.  State emergency management officials believe someone pressed the wrong button.  Oops.  And instead of running a test of the emergency alert system,  midday television viewers and radio listeners were told the state was being evacuated.  The state was being evacuated.  There's absolutely no evacuation or state of emergency.  It was an erroneous message.  The department was investigating how the alert was sent.  Must have been Rick Delgado. 
[01:42:30]  I think he was the producer.  Oh, he's over the top with everything.  Over the top, Rick.  Let me just push this button.  This will be funny.  They'll think a tsunami's coming.  Yeah, they're looking into it, but I guess someone hit the wrong button.  And why would only Connecticut be told to evacuate?  Like, what could possibly be happening in that small little square state?  And did people start evacuating?  That's what I want to know.  Yeah, I wonder how many people actually started evacuating.  Probably none.  It's like when the alarm goes off in a hotel.  Do you leave your room when the fire alarm goes off in a hotel?  Absolutely no.  I never do. 
[01:43:00]  It just starts wailing.  You're like, ah, shut up.  Shut that off.  Because, you know, I hate to say it, and it's probably not a good thing to say,  but 90, 95% of the time, it's a false alarm.  False alarm.  It's kind of like the car alarm thing.  At first, when you first got the car alarm and it went off, it was a big deal.  Like, oh, whoa, something's happening.  Car alarms go off in my neighborhood every single day to the point no one even pays attention anymore.  Oh, they do?  Oh, in the big city?  There, I don't.  I'm in the suburbs.  I haven't heard a car alarm since I left Brooklyn.  When was the last time you saw someone actually run toward a car because they heard the alarm going off? 
[01:43:30]  No one?  Shut up!  And everyone just goes about their business.  It means nothing in this day and age, car alarms.  Nothing.  So I want to know, do we have audio of this?  We've got to try to find this story.  Because I want to know if people were actually evacuating.  Yeah, probably not. 
[01:44:00]  I bet nobody tried to leave the state of Connecticut.  Let's go to Tony in Jersey.  Tony, what's up?  Oh, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Breaking news.  A small plane just crashed on Route 46 outside of Teeterboro Airport.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it should be coming on the news any second.  Why?  Did you see it?  No, I didn't see it, but I get the inside scoop.  Why?  Who are you?  Who am I?  Yeah, who are you that you know?  Well, I just know.  Uh-oh.  He just knows.  Who's this guy?  Who's this guy?  On Route 46, it went for an emergency landing and hit Route 46? 
[01:44:30]  Well, I don't know if it's an emergency landing.  I mean, the details aren't in, but there's debris all over Route 46, and they're getting  ready to shut it down.  Hey, there you go.  See you then.  Plane crash at Teeterboro Airport in New Jersey.  Wow, Tony.  You're like a prognosticator.  Yeah.  You're like a prognosticator.  That's the type of thing.  It came to fruition.  Fooition.  Fooition.  Fooition.  All right, thank you.  Plane hits building after skidding off runway in New Jersey.  Yeah, that doesn't look good.  There you go, guys.  Smoke.  Thank you.  There you go. 
[01:45:00]  We like breaking stories.  All right, Anthony, we'll see what's going on with that.  But yeah, the tsunami song thing.  This just, I told you, I changed my whole feeling on this.  I knew they were going to save the morning show.  I just knew it.  Morning show.  They got rid of two people.  Yeah, the two people that don't matter.  The producer and Todd.  No offense to Rick, you know, he's a good producer.  But I mean, you know, in the long run, it doesn't matter if he stays or goes. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  So they sacrificed him and they sacrificed Todd.  We know Todd from the Comedy Cellar a little bit.  I've talked to him a couple times.  I saw him last night.  And Jimmy knows him.  What is he saying about this whole thing?  I didn't talk to him.  I called him in the afternoon just to see if he was all right, said he was getting fired.  He's like, yeah, I'll talk to you tonight at the Cellar.  And I went on right after him.  And he was gone when I came off.  But at the end of his set, he was apologizing.  He said, like, I'm really sorry about what happened.  I guess it was.  He's apologizing to his audience while he's doing his stand-up?  No, no.  Probably just in general.  He's making. 
[01:46:00]  I think he's probably caught a lot of flack.  And he may have even gotten weird threats or whatever.  So it's probably a smart thing to do.  Yep.  Well, our old producer, and they dragged our names into this on all these hip-hop sites.  Where's that one statement where they're like, huh, figure, is it a producer that used to work for Opie and Anthony or something?  Well, that was the whole campaign of throwing Rick under the bus so they could keep Miss Jones in her seat.  When the truth of the matter is, we listened to the tape.  We listened to the conversation that went on before they played it. 
[01:46:30]  But Miss Jones was completely psyched about this, enjoyed the song, loved it, and played it.  And it was her show and her decision to play it.  Rick didn't tell her to play it.  Regardless, if he wrote the goddamn song, sang on it, it's her show.  She played it.  Like I said before, me and Opie weren't having sex in a church.  We could say, well, it wasn't us.  It was, you know, a guy that was a spotter with this couple, but it wasn't us, so fire whoever you want. 
[01:47:00]  But we didn't do it.  No.  Because the bottom line is, it's your show.  You're responsible for what goes out over the air on your show.  And to throw Rick under the bus and Todd like that just so she could save her job.  Eesh.  Nice that the rap websites, rap websites, the hip-hop ones are all mad.  Yeah, Figures, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, I know, you guys are really bad.  I mean, you should really, you know, fly straight like they do in the hip-hop community.  There you go.  Pull a little stunt like shooting somebody. 
[01:47:30]  Exactly.  Drive-by.  We're putting it out.  Lovely.  They dragged our names into it.  But no surprise here.  You know, they really need, now Miss Jones got all this attention, and there's a hip-hop battle going on here in New York City  because these guys starring Buck Wilde came back to town, and it was a really big deal.  There's billboards over the city, and they're trying to get the hip-hop audience.  And they're pretty much the front-runners to get the hip-hop audience, and Hot 97 had a real battle on their hands to begin with.  And now they got this show, Miss Jones, with all the attention that the Tsunami song brought. 
[01:48:00]  Now they could possibly survive this hip-hop battle.  And that's what Emmys is thinking.  They don't give a crap that people were offended by this song in the end because it comes down to, you know, the ad revenue.  Simple as that.  And now they know that Miss Jones is a valuable commodity to the radio company.  And, you know, they're going to spin it this way and that way with their press releases and stuff.  But Anthony and I understand how this works.  And there's more value in keeping her than firing her, and that's why she stays. 
[01:48:30]  Simple as that.  I was under the impression they were just going to dump everybody, but I guess there's a whole different head going on over there.  They dump a couple of people.  She gets back on.  You won't hear one word of support for Rick or Todd from her mouth.  That's for sure.  You won't hear them mentioned.  It'll just be like they never existed.  We're moving forward.  Yeah.  Why would they fire Todd?  He's an on-air guy.  I can almost understand. 
[01:49:00]  And I like Rick.  I know Rick for years.  But they're going to say, all right, the producer, the PD or something has to go.  But why do you fire Todd, man?  Who didn't do anything wrong?  Just why?  I think – didn't he make the shoot Asians comment?  We all heard it.  We know he was going – he was just saying it in phony, exasperation, like just joking.  I'm going to shoot some Asians.  He didn't know.  No one thinks he's going to shoot Asians.  Well, we got the audio of him saying that.  We could listen and see if he meant it or if he was just doing his job, which is to be kind of edgy and, you know,  and in a way, funny, you know?  If you ask me, Miss Jones made more racial comments than he did by talking about Miss Info, the Asian girl on the show, 
[01:49:30]  and how, you know, she feels superior over her because – wait, because you're Asian?  I'm supposed to – you know, she made some Asian comments.  I guess in the hip-hop community, if you want to talk about shooting people, you should do it with, you know, music behind you,  and then you're going to win a Grammy, and it's acceptable.  Right.  But don't do it in humor.  Once again, comedians held to a different standard than musicians.  Well, here's the story.  Sickening.  Hot 97 boots tsunami song pair vows $1 million in aid. 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  Hot 97 Radio fired two staffers and pledged $1 million for tsunami relief yesterday,  hoping to quell the firestorm over a song that mocked victims of the catastrophe  and used an ethnic slur to describe them.  The actions of the morning show crew were socially and morally indefensible,  and the entire MS family is ashamed by this, said Rick Cummings, president of MS Communications.  Cummings said Miss Jones in the morning.  Jim producer Rick Delgado and on-air sidekick Todd Lynn were asked to send a message that this type of insensitivity is utterly unacceptable. 
[01:50:30]  Really?  Really?  Really?  To send a message?  You're not sending any message.  You want to send a message, you fire the morning show host who has final say.  Yeah.  What?  Who has final say?  Anthony and I do a show.  Producers around us, they give us stuff all the time.  It's up to Anthony and I in the end.  Wow.  Should we do this?  Should we do that?  Because we might get in trouble.  There's no management here to look over us and say,  Hey guys, I know what you're about to play and I think you shouldn't play it. 
[01:51:00]  It really comes down to the morning show host.  Unbelievable.  Rick made a tsunami song.  Obviously over the top, you know, and kind of hacky.  I got to tell Rick, it's a hacky song.  He even says it was, by the way.  And, yeah, you've been talking to him off air a little bit.  And, you know, he handed it in, just like he's done on our show many times in the past.  And some of the stuff we have played and other...  Oh, wow, that guy's dead. 
[01:51:30]  Ew, is that someone in the car all burnt up?  Wow, that guy was just trying to drive to work.  Holy ass.  Gets nailed by a plane.  That stinks.  That's a bad day at work.  That's unlucky lottery right there.  Yeah.  Or is it sucks to be you?  I think that's unlucky lottery.  You're just driving on 46 in Jersey.  You're probably listening to us or whatever, the radio.  And all of a sudden, a plane just takes you out and you don't even see it coming?  Oh, wow. 
[01:52:00]  That plane's kind of in one piece, though.  It doesn't look like it's busted up or burnt up too bad.  That's what happens when they're right at the airport.  If they skid off like that, you've got so much emergency equipment, they could just put it out pretty easy.  Yeah, foaming the hell out of that thing.  You know what's weird?  I always think about stuff like that and then the timing of it.  You know, if that guy left literally not even a second later.  Oh, it stops at a light.  Or earlier.  Wow, that guy's got to be dead, man.  Ah, well, maybe.  But I always think that stuff, that car done and possibly whoever was in it dead. 
[01:52:30]  If that person one second left work one second later or earlier, maybe like he was out the door but forgot his keys.  Oh, I forgot this.  Or, you know what, there's the coffee on my kitchen table.  You know what, I'm going to go back.  I want one more slug of coffee.  He'd be alive.  Oh, I think about that weird crap all the time.  Or if his awful, castrating wife had shut her mouth 30 seconds sooner, he would have been past the crash point.  Would have been out there, right.  So anyway, yeah, but, you know, just like us, you know, Rick worked for us. 
[01:53:00]  You know, he's handed in stuff to us in the past and we're like, you know, Rick.  Rick, that's stunk.  What are you thinking?  But in the end, it's up to us.  Yeah.  So, I mean, if Miss Jones has any, eh, whatever, she should step down.  Oh, yeah, that's going to happen.  Stop.  No, I don't fault her, man.  She's trying to keep her job.  I fault the company.  Yeah, but she was all brave on this tape we're about to play.  Keep them all or boot them all.  That's what should have happened.  Exactly.  You either keep it and stand behind the show and ride it out and keep them all or you wimp out and fire all of them. 
[01:53:30]  You don't fire the producer and a sidekick guy and leave this woman there who's had the final word.  And, Anthony, we have, you know, stepped up for our own people.  There was a time that management at NAW wanted to fire Rick and we walked out.  Rick was fired.  Rick was done.  Oh, yeah, he was actually fired.  They sat us down and said, we're going to fire Rick.  We just, I don't remember what the problem was. 
[01:54:00]  Anthony and I go, yeah, really?  We're not working today.  Bye.  And we walked out.  Ain't going to happen.  We walked out.  So, you know, there's times you've got to stick up for your people.  I agree.  Especially when you're heard on tape, you know, pretty much saying that exact thing.  You know what?  You're not one of us?  You're not supporting the show?  What?  You know, that whole misinfo thing we're about to play.  Yeah, play that.  So, Emmis blamed Rick Delgado for writing, producing, and airing the We Are the World parody  and Lynn for offensive, racially insensitive comments. 
[01:54:30]  Cummings said, Miss Jones, along with sidekicks DJ Envy and Tasha Hightower will be back on the air a week from today to huge ratings, by the way.  Absolutely huge ratings, and that's the only reason they're coming back, but must donate two weeks' salary to give to Asia Tsunami Relief.  I guess that's a website or something.  That's also where Emmis will send its $1 million lump sum donation. 
[01:55:00]  That's right.  You just pay it off and everything's okay.  It's pennies.  It's pennies because of the amount of exposure that this show got and the ad revenue that will come in because of this.  It won't even compare it to the $1 million they just went throw at this thing.  This response, as with all their previous responses, is inadequate, said Queens Councilman John Liu.  He's the most vocal critic of this whole thing.  Of course, because no one's ever listened to him before, and no one ever will again.  This is his one moment in the sun.  I have made it very clear to Emmis that they need to give up a week's worth of advertising revenues, the relief efforts, and by my calculation, that's not $1 million. 
[01:55:30]  Give me a freaking break.  It's $10 million, Liu said, meaning a week's worth of ad revenue.  Liu said that.  Did he?  Rick Delgado and Lynn couldn't be reached for comment.  That means they're under a gag order because Rick would have his face all over TV if he could.  Oh, so this guy is saying now, okay, we'll kind of accept this, but we want another $9 million.  Now it becomes extortion.  Now it's, yeah, money.  I'm so irritated that they fired Todd, and it's not that I like him more than Rick, but just the fact that he's an on-air guy, and he said something racially insensitive, which, let's be honest, on a hip-hop station, it very rarely happens to hear anything racially insensitive. 
[01:56:00]  Rick shouldn't have been fired.  I agree he shouldn't have been.  I agree.  His job is to, no one a producer's job is to do is to throw a whole bunch of shit in front of the hosts of a show.  Produce stuff.  Just throw it all on.  Look at this.  Look at it in front of us.  Look at all this stuff.  And then Ant and I, we just pick around and decide what we want to use today.  Yep.  He has no responsibility as far as that goes. 
[01:56:30]  Your job is to produce stuff that then goes through the host filter.  Right.  As to what is used or not.  He should throw 10 tsunami songs at them, and then maybe there's one that the hosts go, you know what?  This isn't that bad.  I'm going to play this one.  Yep.  He's not, you know, putting a gun to anyone's head saying, play this song.  Here, this is something I made.  You know, play it if you want.  Pat from Munaki checking in, commenting on the plane crash. 
[01:57:00]  He just writes, it wasn't my fault.  It's a corporate jet.  There's someone very important that just crashed.  Yeesh.  All right.  We got to play the audio.  Of course.  Listen to her.  Listen to her.  She's completely into it.  She's chastising other members of the show for not being into this song, not supporting the song.  Crap.  Dr. Jeff?  Yes.  As usual.  Hey.  It's been a pleasure. 
[01:57:30]  Always my pleasure.  I haven't heard the tsunami song, but I would love to hear it myself.  All right.  Well.  I would.  Now is as good a time as any.  Now is a good enough time as any.  Right there, she's deciding, I'm going to play the song again.  Yep.  Not Rick or anyone else.  She's like, okay, this is a good time to play it again.  Right.  Starring the Miss Morning, Miss Jones and the Morning Show Players.  Yes.  Minus Miss Info.  Of course.  Okay.  The Miss Jones Morning Show Players.  Right. 
[01:58:00]  Minus Miss Info.  And then she goes, of course.  Now she's going to lay into Miss Info for not being part of the tsunami song, not being  involved, not supporting it.  Let's see.  The company and Miss Jones, everyone is trying to separate themselves from this song, saying,  ah, we had really nothing to do with it.  Really.  Starring the Miss Jones and the Morning Show Players.  Right.  That's it, damn it.  Why don't you just quit?  Why is it always minus you?  Why are you kidding me like everybody else?  I'd show stop the song.  That song is really offensive to me, and I opted not to involve myself.  But why are you all...  And you know what? 
[01:58:30]  I respect her.  I swear to God, I think I'm different than you guys, but I totally respect her for speaking  up and saying, look, I don't want to be part of this song.  I do, too.  The only problem I have with her is, again, just because she's Asian, she didn't like  the Asian angle.  And you know that this is not the first time.  And in this case, she happened to be right.  But you know anything that's...  You know, Jimmy, I disagree with you.  I mean, yeah, she's Asian, but she may just think it's a hacky song.  Understandable.  But what they're saying is, you always do this, meaning she's done that time and time  again, and you know that mentality and humor. 
[01:59:00]  Can you imagine if one of us, like, every time you guys did something or I said something,  Ant was like, oh, come on, dude, that's really way...  That would get really old.  Yeah, man.  Really quick.  And I'm not saying that she wasn't wrong to dissociate herself with an awful song that she  found offensive, but it's obviously something that she gets...  She gets like this all the time.  And that's what annoys me about her.  It's really offensive to me, and I opted not to involve myself.  But why do you always have to...  Like, if you feel that way, then why are you even on the show?  Like, you always have to separate yourself.  Because I support the fact that all of you guys have the right to say anything that you 
[01:59:30]  want to and make fun of anything that you want to.  And I understand that, especially in a tragedy, that's one way that people deal with things.  But for me personally, I just felt that I needed to opt out of it because me personally, I  couldn't deal with it that way.  I couldn't make fun of that.  And while we all respected that, because I don't think anybody was knocking your door  down to come and ask for your vocals on the song.  No, I mean...  Why do you all...  Wow.  She was very involved with this song.  While we all respected that.  Right.  That means we all discussed this and said, okay, that's fine, you don't have to be a 
[02:00:00]  part of it.  Right.  That's what that means.  And no one was knocking down her door for vocals.  See, they're spinning it in the press release and stuff that she really had nothing to do  with the song, really.  But, I mean, just listen to her.  Listen to her.  She completely supported the writing, the recording of this song, the playing of the song  on her show.  Well, wait.  I'll let you finish.  Let me finish, please.  Yeah?  Why do you always have to make it known that you're separate? 
[02:00:30]  No, I don't think that I always have to make it known.  No, you do.  You do.  You always make it known.  I gotta keep stopping this.  I'm getting more outraged, because now she's like, you know, make it known that you're separate.  Guess what she's now doing?  Guess what she will do?  I'm separate from this whole thing.  Yep.  Separating herself from everything.  Holy crap, the hypocrisy and the bullshit.  No, that, oh, I don't feel that way.  Even a celebrity drama, it's always, oh, well, I don't feel that way.  Well, who, but we're not, it's not always a question of if you agree or not, just give 
[02:01:00]  the damn gossip.  But I forget, you're a journalist, right?  Everybody else gets to say their opinion.  Please, give me a break.  Can I say one thing?  Can I just say one thing?  Just a minute, Envy, you can say it after I'm done.  Info's not always about all of our opinions.  But you don't, you always make it seem like you're separate.  If you want to be separate, be separate.  Go all the way there.  Be separate and be off.  You're misunderstanding.  Of course I am, but I'll tell you what.  Let's make it clear.  Let's make it clear from here on out.  You don't have to be a part of it. 
[02:01:30]  No, I'm trying to.  No, you're not.  You're not.  You're always trying to undermine everything that's done here.  That is so ridiculous.  Okay, well, you guys have a nice day.  We appreciate you.  We appreciate you riding with us.  And you have, of course, of course, because it's the real.  Can I say one thing?  What?  This portion of Ms. Jones in the Morning is sponsored by Sprint PCS.  Brought to you by Sprint PCS.  I don't feel that way.  I was out of it.  Who cares?  Nobody's asking.  You always trying to put our asses out of the line further than yours. 
[02:02:00]  No, I wouldn't say that.  Really?  Whose fat ass is going to be sitting in a chair?  Is that what she does?  With a job.  It's kind of like putting Rick and Todd's ass out there ahead of your own, you idiot.  I guess some asses were out a little further than yours.  Wow, man.  I wouldn't say that.  Yeah, well, you can't do it, but that's what your attempt is.  Anyway, have a great...  It's a very healthy thing from a psychological point of view.  Right, and like I said, I respect that.  But it's bigger than the Tsunami song. 
[02:02:30]  It's bigger than the Tsunami song.  It's every time there's an artist asked to be kissed or an artist asked to be put out there,  you opt, you want the invitations to the parties and to the this and the that,  so you don't even do the job the way it needs to be done because you have a different agenda.  I intend to.  I take it the way it's given, and I'm not a damn fool, and I know you feel you're superior  probably because you're Asian, but you're not.  That's really ridiculous.  You're not.  I know.  It is ridiculous.  The fact that you could be superior. 
[02:03:00]  That whole thing, that whole exchange just, like, angers me.  What is her problem with Asians?  I think she's probably saying that if the girl opted out because I'm part Asian-American,  the girl mentioned her ethnicity, and she's like, well, you probably think you're superior  because you're an Asian.  The girl never once even hinted that she was any more superior than anybody.  The woman has an inferiority complex.  Playing devil's advocate, Asians and blacks have had a lot of problems in the neighborhoods 
[02:03:30]  with the delis and stuff.  I mean, that's just maybe where that comes from.  I don't know.  What was the line?  Your mother.  Oh, your mother should be very proud of you.  Yeah, it was something like, I feel sorry for your mother.  I feel sorry for your mother.  Yeah, yeah.  I feel sorry for your mother.  What?  What did you say?  What was that one where he shoots him and then shows him on the videotape?  Yeah, and then he's showing the videotape.  Boys in the Hood?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No?  No.  It wasn't even a thing.  Menace to Society?  There you go.  Menace to Society. 
[02:04:00]  That was a great one.  Both of them were really good.  Yeah.  Poor Dullboy.  You knew how that one was going to end.  Yeah.  Two weeks later, he was murdered.  Yeah.  All right, let's get back to it.  Thank you.  And tomorrow when I say how many stories to be done in celebrity drama, please follow that.  Thank you.  All right.  Dr. Jeff, sorry you had to be here while family is fighting, but it is what it is.  It is about family.  But next time, just really say how you feel, please.  That's what I try to do.  Always.  Always. 
[02:04:30]  Even when it's not necessary.  I'm going to be at the club tonight.  No, it's not always necessary.  Well, actually, I do by my job on many, many occasions.  How about this?  I'm going to call you now on the warm line.  Let's necessary that.  Let me and you deal like that.  Let's do it.  You guys have a great day.  And I'm glad.  Oh.  Todd, do you see?  That's what he got fired for right there.  What happened right there was she said, I'm going to deal with this.  Ms. Jones was saying how she was going to deal with it.  Todd was just trying to be funny.  Over the top.  Yeah, he was being over the top. 
[02:05:00]  She's like, I'm going to do this.  And then Todd's like, I'm going to start shooting Asians.  No one thinks he's going to shoot Asians.  Right.  It's an outrageous, like, over the top kind of statement.  I see exactly what he was going for there.  If I was there, Mike's would have been off.  I'm going to be at the club tonight.  No, it's not always necessary.  Well, actually, I do by my job on many, many occasions.  You know what?  How about this?  How about this?  I'm going to call you now on the warm line.  Let's necessary that.  Let me and you deal like that.  Let's do it.  You guys have a great day.  And I want you to have the same heart.  It is funny.  That line's funny now. 
[02:05:30]  I get what he meant.  That's just a joke.  Right.  How can anybody know?  That's racially insensitive.  Put a little drum beat behind it.  Then they'll accept it on your shitty music station.  Well, because it's out of context.  Yeah.  And you just see the quote.  Right.  Like, oh, my God.  But in that context, it is a funny line.  Of course.  It's a same heart that you're having now.  Okay.  She sang on this song, by the way.  I'm listening more to her voice.  She is absolutely in this song.  You could hear the girl's voice is Miss Jones' voice. 
[02:06:00]  Well, right, Ricky.  I heard the way she said tsunami.  And it's this exact same way it's said in the song.  And she said earlier about how no one was knocking down your door to give vocals to the song.  Which means it's, you know, she was obviously singing on this.  Write, Rick, and ask him.  They're saying it was Tasha Hightower.  I don't believe it.  It sounds just like Miss Jones.  I think it's her on the song, too.  Listen, girl.  This is Hot 97, your official number one station for hip-hop and R&B. 
[02:06:30]  It's 9.55.  We'll definitely see you at a bar.  I'll send my job.  Some of us, well.  Yeah.  Some of you.  Yeah.  Is that it?  I don't really play the song yet.  I just wanted to hear her vocal.  Oh, okay.  There was a time when the sun was shining bright.  It's a bad song.  So I went down to the beach to catch me a tan.  I like my Tasha.  That's not her.  Then the next thing I knew.  Rick.  I can't even. 
[02:07:00]  I love it.  Then the next thing I knew.  Eyes closed, holding the headphones.  Oh, yeah.  Totally into it.  Oh, that's our boy, Rick.  Jesus, Rick.  That's Rick.  You can almost tell everyone else is not really into it.  They're like, ah, maybe we'll get a giggle out of this.  And it's Rick.  No, man.  The next thing I knew.  My ass was out the door.  You know why you just yell at the girls.  Sing, you bitch.  Sing.  Oh, my God. 
[02:07:30]  I got to.  I didn't even want to hear it.  No, I got to.  You have to.  It's a classic.  Then the next thing I knew.  Oh, wave 20 feet high.  Can't be washed your whole country away.  And all at once.  That's classic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You could hear the screaming change.  Oh.  And no one was saved from the wave. 
[02:08:00]  There were Africans drowning.  Little tournament swept away.  You could hear God laugh and swim.  You bitches swim.  So now you're screwed.  Oh.  It's the tsunami.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  Go find your mind.  This song doesn't even make sense.  No.  I just saw a blow by. 
[02:08:30]  A tree right through a head.  Oh, Todd.  And now your children will be sold.  Child slavery.  So now you're screwed.  That's her right there.  It's a tsunami.  She's in there.  In that mix right there.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  Go find your mommy.  Go find your mommy.  I was so close by.  A tree right through her head. 
[02:09:00]  And now your children will be sold.  Child slavery.  The deployment lies.  Jonesy.  It's Jones in the morning.  No, I don't know.  That's enough.  I don't know if that was her.  I can't tell.  I absolutely think that was her.  Rick will tell us.  We'll email him.  That's true.  Too bad we can't get Drew Boogie to break it down by different tracks.  A.  Rick.  Comma.  Comma.  Did Miss Jones sing on that song? 
[02:09:30]  Question mark.  And send.  There you go.  I'm making news.  You sure are.  That's right.  Let's play Rick's Christopher Street.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  See, now here's one where the producer gave us a song and we went, sure, we'll play that.  And this is great proof that no matter how vicious a parody is, as long as it's well-written  and funny, man, it's all that matters.  This is a vicious one, but God damn it, it's great.  Of course it is.  Rick, everybody. 
[02:10:00]  We're all gang, stick it, see, in our egg.  T-cells low, we got the HIV.  It's a great way to lose some weight on our way to Christopher Street.  Dead in days, legions all over my face.  Pound my egg, then grab some A-Z-T. 
[02:10:30]  You can watch my life wither away on our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  There you have it.  That is really bad.  It's funny, though, man.  I asked for this when we first came back on the air.  There's a Christopher Reeve parody sung to Kryptonite by Three Doors Down.  Oh, no, really? 
[02:11:00]  It is my favorite song parody, but it's in a live setting, so it's a little hard to hear.  But it is so well-written.  It is so, I just enjoy it as a regular song.  Where can we find that?  I'll give him the link right after.  You can play it, but some of the lyrics, it's really brilliantly written.  We'll give it a try.  We'll give it a shot.  Did we get milk, or we had to send someone out?  Ricky's going out and getting it.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'll be some milk.  No, I'm ready to pass out.  I didn't have enough food today. 
[02:11:30]  You need a little back rub?  Huh?  What did you eat?  Just the oatmeal today.  And that isn't enough to keep you going?  No, we're different that way.  You can eat a little-  No, no, I mean, I understand you need something, but Jesus, you ate something.  You eat just a bagel and a banana, and you're good until dinner time.  It's crazy.  I've got to eat the whole show.  Wow.  And I've been checked for all sorts of, you know, the diabetes and all that crap.  That's crazy stuff.  I know.  Why don't we do a little mash-up here?  One of my favorites.  It's called stalling, because I've got to get food in me.

Go out to the parking lot, and you get in your car, and you drive real far,  and you drive all night, and you see your light, and you come right down,  Man's on the ground and out from the man from Mars  Then you drive the run, put a static gun  And shoot you dead and eat your hair  And then you eat the man from Mars  You go out at night, eating cars  You eat catfacts, you eat cheese  Mercury's and Subaru  And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars 
[02:14:30]  Then, when there's no more, I just go out at night  And eat on Mars, bread people's meat  Face to face, get cheek to cheek  One-to-one, man-to-man  Let's cook the tub, don't eat the stove  But you're meant for Mars, it's a fluid car  He's in the bar, he's in the bar  He's in the bar, he's in the bar  He's in the bar, he's in the bar  All the halls, you want to eat them all  Wrap the door, the future, take the tour  Through the soul, come a straight train  Baby train, you'll be singing in the rain

[02:17:30]  Fighters on the Storm  It's the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report. I'm John Lewis. This report brought to you by Smugglers Notts, Vermont. The number one family resort in North America where family fun is always guaranteed. Visit Smugs.com. Well, all the sunshine sent the Snow Country crew into the parks at Killington, Vermont. 
[02:18:00]  Really picking up the speed today at Killington. We explored Bear Mountain where it was all about the terrain parks. Right from the top, an assortment of boxes and rails and some huge kickers, too. I stood up to the side and watched this guy go off and do a backward somersault and land it like it was absolutely nothing. Just a walk in the park for him, I guess. For Snow Country, I'm Jan Elliott.  Awesome. Thanks, Jan. At Sunday River Main, you'll find a park at American Express. Let's go to Jiminy Peak in Massachusetts skiing everything. In fact, they've got a pipe jam coming up this weekend. Seven Springs in PA, all 11 lifts cranking. Sugar Mountain in North Carolina, sweet across our 20 trails. Jackson Hole in Park City, Utah with fresh snow in all their trails. Mammoth, California, living large with over 30 feet of snow this season. I'm John Lewis with the XM Radio Ski and Ski. 
[02:18:30]  We've made it easier to get XM. 
[02:19:00]  It's everything. 24-7. XM 202. The O&A virus. It's everything. All the time.  Mammoth, the XM 202. 
[02:19:30]  I understand I have problems. Trust me. I know that. Do you hear yourself?  Dude, what did I say before break? What did I say?  I understand. There's something that happens from time to time with me. Matter of fact, it was a promo.  Yep.  Because they forgot my potatoes.  Yes, it was the potatoes.  It wasn't about the potatoes. My blood sugar level drops and I start losing my mind.  I understand. 
[02:20:00]  Dude, I just played a seven-minute mash-up song. Not for the stupid audience. I could care less about them.  Half of them went to another channel for a while. I threw that on so we could take a quick commercial break and I could get some food in my gullet so I don't pass out.  I am not talking about this situation.  So I wrote a note while we're discussing the stupid tsunami song that I could give a flying crap about, by the way, but I figured it would fill up 20 minutes of radio today.  I wrote a note to Steve. Steve, SOS, I need milk immediately, meaning my blood sugar level is dropping as I speak. 
[02:20:30]  So that was literally five minutes before we went to break and then I'm noticing there is no milk around.  So I'm like, I'm a professional DJ. Find what's called filler.  So I'm like, make it believe I care that the Doors Blondie song is cool enough to play on the show.  No, it was because it was the longest thing I could find, which was like six minutes long.  I'm like, hey, man, this is great. Listen to this crap.  Thinking that the milk would arrive any second, I would get the cereal in my effing stomach and then I would be fine for the rest of the show. 
[02:21:00]  I am not talking about the situation at hand.  I am talking about the fact that you sound like a madman.  And I understand.  I'm not saying I'm not with your milk.  His only crime is he was pulling it from a Dwayne Reed bag.  Who the eff gets milk from Dwayne Reed? 
[02:21:30]  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  He unloads on him.  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  Because I need it right away. There's a deli right downstairs. Is there not?  You sound crazy.  Is there a deli right downstairs?  There is absolutely a deli and I agree they should have gotten the milk from the deli.  We have a bunch of retards that should be strapping bombs on them and walking around in Iraq then working for us.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing how desperate I am right now? 
[02:22:00]  How come when I walked in, I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  I don't know.  I know. He yells at Jimmy, where's my milk?  Like I have a line on the milk getting.  You don't understand. My meters are like dropping fast.  So it's called I go into a panic.  It's not that I'm a diva or any of that.  I treat these guys very nice unless I get into one of these situations.  Eric, why wasn't the milk gotten from the deli that is right downstairs from this very building? 
[02:22:30]  Okay, one, I didn't send him, so I don't know where he went.  Two, apparently I've been told they don't sell milk downstairs at that deli.  They don't sell milk downstairs, Danny?  They don't have sealed milk downstairs at the deli.  I don't care if it's sealed.  They'll put it in like a coffee cup.  But that's fine.  Oh, see, now, how is anyone to know?  You wouldn't come up with that and go, what is it?  I don't know what that animal's doing.  It's open.  It's open.  It's an open container, Tina.  Hold on.  No, that's where I'm different than Jimmy. 
[02:23:00]  I don't really care about that, especially under this situation.  I just need to get food in me.  I don't care.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  You know what we need?  Emergency Parmalat milk.  You put it in a cabinet somewhere, and it lasts forever.  It sits there, and then when you open it up, then it's got to be refrigerated.  But it's like, in case of emergency, break glass, and you have your milk right there.  We have that.  I said that when I came in.  Stop it.  We have whole milk Parmalat.  That's all we have.  And he looked at me and did nothing. 
[02:23:30]  Because I didn't know what that was.  No one does.  No, I really didn't know what that was.  No, no, it's regular milk.  It's just been processed in a way that it's good until you open.  It's like, here's the other problem.  There is milk in the refrigerator, but you don't know if it went sour or anything.  That's Parmalat right there.  I really don't know what that is.  It's milk.  It's real milk.  There's nothing different about it.  It's just the way it's processed.  It can last sealed.  It can last for a long time.  Can I explain something to Dean in the Bronx?  I know I'm whining.  That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
[02:24:00]  I understand.  Anthony brought it up during commercials going, dude, you sound like a raging woman.  I had to look right at Opie and go, you sound like a madman.  You're trying to wake me up out of this weird coma state I get into.  It has nothing to do with being like, you know, Patrice from Brazil is saying, come on.  Come on.  I feel the whole blood sugar level thing dropping in my body drastically, okay?  We still have a radio show to do.  And then I'm looking at the clock and all the meters, you know, counting down thinking, 
[02:24:30]  I don't have enough time to eat before we get back on the air.  And then they walk in with the milk in a Dwayne Reed bag.  I'm like, I know where Dwayne Reed is.  It's not close to here.  No.  So who went and got it?  Ricky.  Oh.  Of course it was Ricky.  He stinks.  He stinks.  If Opie wants milk, he only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  No Dwayne Reed.  Never Dwayne Reed.  Jesus.  That is an odd place to get milk.  Mike from Jersey.  My goodness.  Look, I'm calming down already. 
[02:25:00]  Mike?  Where did you buy your cold medicine?  Dairy barn?  Long Island joke.  Mikey?  Opie, you sound like Doc from Back to the Future right now.  It's like you're asking for 10,000 gigawatts.  That's a stretch.  Yeah.  All right.  There he is.  Now we'll listen to Opie eat because he had to go to Dwayne Reed for the milk.  I thought, stupid me, by the time the mashup was done, I would have had the...  You'd have been done.  You'd have been on seconds already.  And no one would have cared.  And, you know, the show would have just moved on. 
[02:25:30]  You'd have been on your seconds.  What the hell is that?  The tail of the plane?  I don't know.  You were saying during the break...  But it looked like the other plane...  Didn't hit two planes, did it?  I don't know.  We don't really know the story of the breaking news of this.  The plane itself looked pretty survivable.  The U.S. Lodge is in one piece.  If it stopped before fire filled it up, I think people could have gotten out of there.  I think the car's on the ground.  A couple of people might have gotten killed from that.  But the plane itself didn't look in bad shape.  It was in one piece.  Do you know how long you're sitting there in traffic when there's a plane on fire on the road? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, that's not going to clear...  They're not going to open a lane for people to go through over the fire hoses.  When there's a burning plane in the street, you are waiting for quite a while.  You better call your boss.  Yeah.  It's over.  The plane accelerated, but apparently didn't take off.  Hmm.  A little problem, maybe?  A little setting problem?  Oh, thanks, Eric.  Why don't you just send him for milk?  Why would it matter if Bob Kelly's here?  He's got to tell you, though. 
[02:26:30]  I saw him.  Where?  No, you saw him.  I thought you might have breaking info about the jet crash.  He's holding up a big sign.  Bob Kelly's who cares.  Bob Kelly was in the plane.  He's good to goof on for ten minutes.  I don't care.  I thought you had breaking news about the plane crash.  Wow.  Next time, get the milk faster.  Jesus Christ, it's insane.  And the thing is, Bob Kelly's wearing a Dwayne Reed shirt.  He's going to have to pay for that. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, Ben.  Yeah.  What's up?  Ben, how happy are you that you're not here today to take the wrath of a milkless Opie?  Milk Diva.  How's it going down there in D.C.?  Everything's good.  What are you doing?  I was just hanging out with Elo, and now I'm in our studio, and I'm going across the hall to one of the other shows.  And then I'm meeting with all the music people later.  So I have a lot of productive meetings.  Is that now our studio down there?  I guess, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  I'm trying to find the templates, because Steve didn't know where the templates are. 
[02:27:30]  So I was looking in here.  But yeah, it's our studio.  Everything's still here.  It's just like it's our studio.  So yeah, no, I have a bunch of stuff to do.  What are you doing with another show?  I am going to, since the Bob Edwards producer sat in with us for an hour the other day,  I'm going to go, I'm going across the hall now to see what they do, just to get a different perspective.  In other words, you're going to watch paint dry for an hour.  Bring a pillow.  Welcome to the melatonin hour.  I know he's pretty much the biggest personality in that NPR type stuff, but what a bore fest. 
[02:28:00]  It's NPR.  It really is.  I know he does a great job.  He's the best bore out there, but my God.  Oh my God, you better finish that bowl before you get us all thrown out of here.  He's not a bore?  You should have heard what Norton was saying about the guy.  I never heard of him.  Why don't you tell Anthony how big his head is?  Hold on a second, Mr. Jones.  No, you have the right to make fun of Bob Edwards. 
[02:28:30]  I'm not saying you don't.  I'm just pulling myself out of it.  Right.  I heard he's very good at what he does.  I just noticed that when he was walking, he had a large skull.  Not unlike our old Ben, but Ben's is kind of fat and retarded, whereas Bob's is long and Stonehenge-ish.  It's just not my cup of tea.  And, you know, the guy was supposed to be on our show yesterday, and he blew us off because he was too busy smoking or something.  So, you know, F him.  Who cares?  Yeah, we are a little annoyed.  I could care less about him and his stupid NPR show.  Are we on the phone with Ben or Darth Vader? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  I love the breathing.  And he saw the Mad Mexican.  He's like, what am I getting on the show again?  I want to get on the show again.  Oh, dude, you know what?  They're new friends.  Get D.D. and the Mad Mexican to call our show.  Okay.  No, I'm serious.  Use yourself.  Well, whatever.  Just get him to call.  Okay.  No, I'm dead serious.  Produce from Washington.  Get him to call.  Produce.  So, when are your meetings over?  I have a 2 o'clock train.  Oh, you're coming home.  Yeah, I'll be back today.  We miss you, Ben.  Oh, man.  Misses little herkin jerk walking around the studio.  It's not the same. 
[02:29:30]  I'm just not looking around and seeing your, like, you know, little figure.  Yeah, big head.  Hey, Ben, what about the Sarah Jessica Parker?  Sarah Jessica Parker.  You called earlier about that.  I texted you.  You guys, I remember it clearly.  She was in her trailer.  There was a guy in her trailer area listening to the show.  She came back on the trailer, heard it, asked the guy in the trailer what was going on,  and then called in from there.  That was the initial call.  I don't know if there was a second call, but that was the first call.  I remember it clearly.  Oh, wow.  I would have thought it was the cab. 
[02:30:00]  No.  I'm still going to have to hear it to confirm it, but I'm not taking Ben's word for it.  No, I remember this one pretty quick.  She might have called again, but the first time there was a guy that was listening in  her trailer, and she had just come back and heard the whole Ruth Buzzi thing, and then  called in.  Because I remember it clearly, and I remember Rick talking to her off the air and telling  him how much he loved Sex and the City, and then, you know, putting her through.  Probably trying to get a part.  Yeah, exactly.  So, but that's how it initially started. 
[02:30:30]  So, I think everyone just confused.  There might have been another call, and I just can't remember on that.  So.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Get the Mad Mexican to call us.  All right.  I'll go get him.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Good.  Ben, down there, taking care of business.  I'll say he is.  There we go.  You done with your cereal?  Just about.  Whew.  See you.  All right, everyone.  Stand down, everybody.  You may stand down.  Everyone, stand down.  Opie has completed his cereal. 
[02:31:00]  It's bad, man.  Wow.  I understand.  Just insanity.  It's quite embarrassing.  I understand.  I'm not going to feel too good about myself later when I listen to the replay.  Will there be some guilt and stuff?  Of course there will be.  Why did I do that?  The Captain Queeg and Anthony show.  I knew there was milk somewhere, and it had the, uh...  All right.  There was milk, but he went down to Dwayne Reed.  He could have gone right down to the deli.  They were singing Old Gravy Stain. 
[02:31:30]  I just couldn't comprehend the Dwayne...  How many portions of milk did you get from Dwayne Reed?  How many did you get from the deli?  I just couldn't comprehend looking at a Dwayne Reed pharmacy bag and going, that's why  I had to wait.  That's why.  They're selling milk in drugstores now?  That Dwayne Reed bag set you off like I've never seen a shopping bag set anyone off.  He went insane.  He saw that big Dwayne Reed logo and lost his mind. 
[02:32:00]  It was.  It was like watching, uh...  What's her name?  Looking at that wire hanger in the closet.  Yeah, I know.  Little kids don't get that upset when they see a little bag in a stall in a men's room.  Prinkle, prinkle.  The old lad bag.  Brian, what's up?  Hello.  Hey, Brian.  Go ahead.  What's going on, man?  I love your show, man.  Y'all rock.  Cool.  No, I'm going to give you advice about your blood sugar, man.  Yeah.  They got the...  In the pharmacy, you go to any drugstore, they got these little sugar tablets for like 
[02:32:30]  when your blood sugar drops.  All right.  Pretty cool, man.  How about that?  You just pop a sugar tablet while you're waiting for your milk.  I probably just didn't eat enough food is what it is.  Although, if he's at Dwayne Reed...  He used them all the time in case the sugar goes low.  All right.  Well, what happened?  Because we were traveling yesterday, I was too tired to eat.  You ever get like that?  You just want to go to bed?  Too tired to eat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got home, I'm like...  Oh, God.  It was like it was a hassle to eat.  I'm like, oh, nah, screw that.  I'll just go to bed. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  So, the last time we ate was in that stupid cafeteria down there at what?  Noon?  The afternoon.  So, that's why.  A sugar tablet.  But then you have to go to Dwayne Reed to get it.  And if you're there, you might as well just get the milk.  That's right.  It's right there.  Or a candy bar.  This problem goes way back because remember Gary Wall?  Ah, yes.  He bought me Jell-O every day and had it in his office just in case.  Remember?  Like the school nurse.  I know.  You need some Jell-O.  You okay now?  Dave, what's up?  Let's move on here.  Go ahead, Dave. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  How's my little closed-hangered, half-aborted mongoloid?  Better now.  Thanks, Dave.  That's rough.  Hey, listen.  I've got ironclad proof that the Pittsburgh Steelers lost against the Patriots on purpose.  And I know Ben's going to say, you know, go after yourself.  You're talking out your ass.  But listen to this.  The Steelers lost on purpose because if they would have won that game,  they would have needed to be in Jacksonville all of this week, correct?  Yes.  How in the world could they be in Jacksonville and at home February 3 through 5 to see Jimmy 
[02:34:00]  Norton at the improv?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I saw that comment.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  I've got it all outlined on my website, www.eatabullet.com.  Or you can call me on my cell, and I'm going to answer the phone, Pitchburg Improv,  but those are just code words.  412-462-5233.  Thanks for the call.  Thank you, fellas.  Very informative, and I actually believe you. 
[02:34:30]  Thank you.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Who saw that comment?  That blindsides me every time, and it is so – what a talent.  They're getting more and more creative.  They really are.  Super Bowl conspiracy.  Speaking of the Super Bowl, Terrell Owens is just babbling in the sports section today  from the Eagles.  It looks like he's going to play now.  Why do these people do this?  Does he understand how stupid he looks babbling like this?  That's why the Pats are going to kick the Eagles' ass. 
[02:35:00]  Yep.  Because they're more of a team.  It's all about Terrell Owens.  No I in team.  That's right.  This is unbelievable, though.  Terrell Owens on God's reason for giving him an ankle injury, Anthony.  God gave him the ankle injury.  Why?  And now he knows the reason?  Enough with the God crap in sports.  He knows the reason, though?  God told him?  God's not paying attention to you.  He's got other things going on.  You think of the whole scheme of the billions of people crawling around on this shithole rock 
[02:35:30]  that sports plays part in God's plan and his thinking and praying to him about sports  is actually going to do something?  I want to thank God.  Ugh.  Makes me puke every time.  God gave him that injury, and while God was busy worrying about Terrell Owens,  he forgot to look out for the boy with Down syndrome who was being captured by insurgents  and strapped with explosives.  With explosives.  God's priorities stink.  Guided him.  Well, God may have guided him to that empty field while the dope hit the button with no 
[02:36:00]  one around him.  Well, there's a rumor that God took the under on the game.  Idiot Terrell Owens.  Dopey, big-tongued idiot probably walked up to a mirror and hit the button.  Yeah.  Bad man!  Kablam!  I'm sure Allah will be thrilled to see this idiot walk through the pearly gates.  Can you tell this moron?  It's not Allah.  It's Allah.  Oh, bro.  Well, Terrell Owens on God's reason for giving him an ankle injury, Anthony. 
[02:36:30]  God is using me to put me on a platform to really show the world how great he is.  How great he is himself or God is?  How great he is.  God.  God.  Oh.  So he's using him.  God is using me to put me on a platform to really show the world how great he is.  How great God is.  Oh, really?  God is using Terrell Owens to show the world how great God is.  I think God already showed how great he is by wiping out a quarter million people with 
[02:37:00]  one wave.  That's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  Right there.  That's pretty impressive.  No, what's more impressive is that Terrell Owens is going to play in the Super Bowl, which  is a joke to begin with, with an ankle injury, and win it for the Eagles, and that's going  to show how great God is.  People will go, wow, that God.  You know, all that other stuff, that miracle crap, eh, nothing.  But this stuff, that's good stuff.  Well, if you look close, you can actually see the Virgin Mary on his Achilles, stupid  jackass. 
[02:37:30]  No one cares about you.  How is that?  Does he believe this?  That he is like a message?  A lot of these athletes, when they're thanking God, you know, for giving me the confidence  and the faith to...  What?  I thank God for, you know, for the win.  Like, God is up there rooting for his team.  He's got his little God banner up on his wall.  I think, Terrell, there are believers on the Pats as well.  So I think your thing here just doesn't wash too well.  I think God is firmly behind the Pats. 
[02:38:00]  You know, if you look at the season, God is a Pats fan.  Terrell Owens on Terrell Owens, he says, a lot of people kind of criticized my character  and my antics.  A lot of people say I'm controversial.  And they may be right.  But I am who I am.  God laid this plan out for me.  Obviously, it was in God's plans for me to be controversial, and I accept that.  Right.  Of course it is.  God's not paying attention to you, you ass. 
[02:38:30]  He is.  He's busy.  He's worried about Terrell Owens.  He forgot to tell that girl and her boyfriend not to walk down that alley where he was going  to be pistol whipped and she was going to be shot in the chest.  Oops.  Yeah, God makes mistakes, too.  He missed that one while he was worried about showing the world his greatness through this  overpaid, arrogant jizz bag.  Yeah, because that's what's important in God's eyes.  Right, exactly.  Overpaid athletes.  I see blowout.  I see turn it off at halftime.  I don't know, man. 
[02:39:00]  I do.  It's over, Johnny.  I think the Pats are going to roll over them.  I truly do.  Any wagers?  With him playing, his dream may come to fruition.  I'm not sure.  There he is.  We'll get to Bob Kelly in a minute.  Don't worry.  Stupid David Wells.  He'll see it soon.  He'll hear it.  15 seconds.  Yeah, really fast.  Because basically, the doctors have told Terrell Owens that he just can't play. 
[02:39:30]  I mean, his ankle is not going to be able to withstand, you know, playing.  And he goes, I can honestly say God has already cleared me to play.  Oh, God cleared him.  So it doesn't really matter what the doctor said.  I've got the best doctor of all, and that would be God.  Dr. God.  Dr. God is telling him, no, he needs to play.  Yeah.  Dr. God will see you now.  Dr. God doesn't take after insurance, Mr. Norton.  So you have to pay it and then submit it.  I hope the Eagles get blown out, and I hope Terrell Owens never plays again,  because he was stupid. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know what's funny?  Dr. God once told God.  Nah, I forget.  I kind of screwed up.  Oh, damn.  Oh, boy.  Oh, I was so into it.  I totally forgot what I was going to say, and I realized my mouth had already started moving.  What happened there?  Dr. God.  What happened?  There's a good Dr. God joke coming up.  Maybe a prescription.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Well, that sure was a prescription for disaster.  That's what they say.  That's what they call it.  Hey, Patrick.  From Teterboro Airport, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  Yes, Patrick.  Hey, guys.  What's going on, man? 
[02:40:30]  Hey.  It's hurting uptown here.  I mean, I probably can't tell you more than what you're seeing on TV, but, I mean, there's  every camera crew in the world here.  Somebody wants to pull out a wild sign when they start going live again.  They're probably...  I mean, there's our guys radio interviewing.  I mean, there's every kind of cop and Homeland Security here.  Yeah.  I don't know if this is helping you out at all, but, you know.  Not really, sir.  I don't think this is an act of terrorists where they decide to take out one commuter 
[02:41:00]  at it as he's taking off.  As whatever.  Sorry, man.  It's all right.  The plane was going out to Chicago, from what I hear.  Yeah.  Two hundred and eleven missing is what they're saying right now.  Yeah.  It wasn't...  It probably was iced or something.  I mean, it looked like he just couldn't get the flaps up to get the plane off the ground.  He was plowed to the fence and then went right...  Could be a little ice, right?  Yeah.  Thank you.  De-ice those.  The major ones are not as bad if not de-ice, like the 757s and stuff, because they're so 
[02:41:30]  hot and they're so large.  But these things can't break de-ice when the wings expand.  The wings can't expand.  A quarter inch of ice on the leading edge of a wing will keep you from taking off.  Yeah.  A little quarter inch of ice.  That's it?  Yep.  That's all it takes.  Okay.  Because a plane, from what I understand, is actually built on suction.  The way the air goes over the wing, it actually sucks the plane up.  Ooh, that's hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  Suck that plane.  It truly is.  We interrupt the Opie and Anthony program to go to the phone and talk to the cricket.  Cricket.  Live from Washington, D.C., it's Dee Dee. 
[02:42:00]  Dee Dee.  Good morning.  How are you, baby?  I'm fine.  How are you guys?  We're doing geek.  We're fine.  Stop.  So what's going on?  Are you a big star down there in Washington now?  I'm getting lots of emails at XM Kids, your listeners.  Oh, really?  They're emailing.  Yeah.  What are the listeners saying?  The crossover audience with XM Kids.  They're just saying I was their favorite guest Tuesday.  Uh-huh.  Ooh.  And they want me, you know, to keep checking in and saying hi. 
[02:42:30]  Well, on the message board, I think it's on whackbag.com, there's a whole section dedicated  to you where people are coming up with things they want you to say.  Oh, God.  Okay.  What do you want me to say?  Uh-oh.  Will you say anything?  Sure.  I mean, on your channel, I can.  Yeah.  On our channel.  All right.  Hold on.  Well, there was actually a big controversy because people were saying that you were wrong  about where the Wiggles were from.  I got three emails saying you were wrong.  They're from Down Under.  Where?  Where, though?  Down Under is a very large area. 
[02:43:00]  Somewhere.  I don't know.  New Zealand, right?  I'm not going to say the country.  I know you want me to say it.  Why?  You said you'd say anything.  Yeah, please do.  Okay, Australia.  Australia.  Australia.  That makes us giggle.  They're from Australia.  Oh.  Oh, there's the snort.  Australia.  It hurts when I do that.  Good.  Good.  Yeah, people have asked us to say some, for you to say some things like.  Okay.  All right.  I'm sorry. 
[02:43:30]  What was the one, Daddy, put it in my dirty spot?  Oh, my.  Okay.  You want me to say that?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I'm like, okay, hold on.  Daddy, put it in my dirty spot.  All right.  Hold on.  Go back.  Did someone request that?  Oh, yeah.  There's a million requests on whackbag.com.  You got some sick listeners.  Yes, we do.  Give it to me.  We're not on.  I think you need to put a little more personality into it.  Yeah.  I got one.  Say it like you would as cricket. 
[02:44:00]  This is from me.  He wants you to say, I'm on my period, so you'll have to fuck me in the ass.  Oh, that's sick.  Okay.  Hold on.  She's a chipper.  I know she'll do it.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  That's sick.  Okay.  I'm on my period, so you'll have to fuck me in the ass.  Dad.  All right.  Here's one that's a little tamer. 
[02:44:30]  Just say.  Oh, my God.  No, this is tamer.  Just say, this house is clean.  This house is clean.  All right.  That's from Pulse.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Just say, Daddy, can I come too?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  He's going to the store, and you want to go with him.  Yeah, okay.  Sure.  I'm sure they mean C-U-M.  Okay, Daddy, can I come too?  Now, ask it slow like you're acting in a role, like you're young.  Daddy, can I come too? 
[02:45:00]  I got a rod.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Can you say this?  If you work hard, your dreams will come to fruition.  Um, what?  Oh, never mind.  He's an ass.  Let's see.  I'm trying to find others there for you.  Let's see.  Hurry up, because I have to do a report.  Oh, right.  Uh, DeeDee, just say, it won't fit in my mouth.  Oh, my God.  Okay, hold on. 
[02:45:30]  It won't fit in my mouth.  How about, uh, Mommy doesn't have to know.  Oh, my God.  Mommy doesn't have to know.  Oh, that's horrible.  Can you say this?  This is my request.  You are sick.  Is that Norton?  Yeah, yeah, this is mine.  This is my particular one.  Could you say, please don't kill my puppy.  I'll do as you say.  Please don't kill my puppy.  I'll do as you say. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, it's horrible.  Oh, I love it.  Let's see.  I'm trying to find others.  Uh, we understand you have a report to do.  Yeah, I do Chicago and then Minneapolis.  How did the XM Kids thing go yesterday?  Nice?  Yeah.  Yeah, you played some nice songs?  Played, um, Poop Goes the Weasel.  You did play Poop Goes the Weasel.  You're obsessed with this song.  I love it, because it goes, like, fart noise.  It's hilarious. 
[02:46:30]  I could just picture kids in the cars going,  Poop Goes the Weasel, and their parents getting annoyed.  Do we have it?  Oh, we do.  We actually have it.  Yeah, let's listen to it real fast.  It's funky as a diaper.  Right.  All right.  You got that one, too, Art?  Funky as a diaper.  And down the toilet bowl, big monkey chased the weasel,  but weasel has the diapers on.  That's silent.  Goes the weasel.  Jesus.  Big monkey takes the diapers off, wipes the weasel's bottom, 
[02:47:00]  puts clean diapers on, and then goes the weasel.  This is on a kid's channel?  Goes down the toilet bowl, big monkey tells the weasel.  So weasel takes the diapers off, weasel climbs up on the hole.  What?  But weasel doesn't have to go.  Well, maybe weasel has to go.  Then weasel gets the feeling. 
[02:47:30]  And weasel knows it's time to go.  Goes the weasel.  In the water down the hole, that is where the poop goes.  Weasel knows the feeling now.  Goes the weasel.  Flush the toilet down the bowl.  If there was a toilet bowl when I was a kid, I'd be happy.  Goes the weasel.  Really?  Yeah, those are fun songs. 
[02:48:00]  That is the most offensive thing I've ever heard on radio.  Goes the weasel.  A tree right through his head.  Oh, that is an offensive song.  It really is.  You could not play that on regular radio, by the way.  I know.  You can't like some kids.  Yeah.  Wow.  And what's the other song you like?  Funky as a diaper.  Touch daddy's weasel.  Oh, this one rocks. 
[02:48:30]  Funky as a diaper.  The kids seem to like this.  Oh my God, they love it.  Favorite song.  I'm a natural at being me.  Got no responsibilities.  I eat and sleep from nine to five.  And when I'm done, I'm super jive.  I'm funky.  Funky as a diaper.  Funky as a diaper.  Funky as a diaper.  I'm a little boo to dig my fat.  This birthday suit is where it's at. 
[02:49:00]  Keep me fed.  See, there's some fun music there on XM Kids.  All right.  How much street cred do you think this guy rapping has?  Yeah, no doubt, man.  That was very good, actually.  I know.  All right, I have to go do a report.  All right.  One last one, okay?  Okay, one last one just for you.  Okay, well, two, real fast.  Let me show you on my dolly where he touched me.  Oh my God, you guys are sick.  Okay, let me show you on my dolly where he touched me. 
[02:49:30]  And finally, Uncle Jimmy, want me to make poopy on you?  Oh, sick.  Okay, hold on.  I have to get the giggles out.  Wait, Uncle Jimmy, do you want me to make poopy on you?  Very good, Deedee.  A.K.A. Cricket, you rock.  You guys rock.  All right.  No, you rock.  No, you rock.  No, you rock.  You rock. 
[02:50:00]  All right, have a good Groundhog Day.  Six more weeks of winter.  Yeah, when are you on today?  I've got to listen to you today.  Well, today is Wednesday.  Actually, I'm not on today because I was off of my kids' show today.  I'll be back on tomorrow.  On the kids' channel.  What channel is that?  Channel 116.  116 at what time?  12 to 4, Eastern Standard Time.  I'll be back on tomorrow.  All right, good.  There she goes, Deedee.  A.K.A. Cricket. 
[02:50:30]  All right.  Cricket.  She rocks.  She's that hysterical, man.  Wow.  That is an awful song.  Funky has a diaper.  Oh, the other one.  The monkey chased the weasel.  The weasel's got to take a dump.  And then there's a strain and a fart noise.  Why don't we get that for our machines so we can get that stuck in people's heads?  It's supposed to train kids to go to the bathroom.  Now you know the feeling.  So you're supposed to know that when you get that little pressure going that you run to the turlet. 
[02:51:00]  And you let it go.  Let her fly.  Are there actual songs that the people will hear and get stuck in their heads that they hate?  Yeah, there are a few.  And I would love to play one if, you know, I had my templates.  I just heard this.  Oh, Eric, don't come running over.  Thank you.  But you and your Dwayne Reed bag.  Yeah.  Little feet.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[02:51:30]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  I've got this feeling, so appealing, for us to get together and sing, sing.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, banana phone.  It grows in bunches, I've got my hunches.  It's the best, beat the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[02:52:00]  Ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, ping.  Pananaphone  It's no baloney  It ain't a phony  My cellular  Pananaphone  Anthony, one day what we're going to do  Is play that song every time we go to the phone  Wow  It's ironic  That's what he called his lawyer on  Oh, God, Jim  Jesus, Jim  Oh  The internet is for porn 
[02:52:30]  The internet is for porn  Me up all night  Hugging me porn to porn  Porn, porn  Banana phone  Let's go to the phone  And then just play that every time  Banana phone  Hello  Alright, Jesus  Man, you think  The person that was working in that building bought it  He's just at his desk hanging out  Oh, you're sitting there 
[02:53:00]  Checking out his email  Just got to work  Checking out his email  And the plane comes flying through the wall  Right through a big brick wall  Stupid jeep  He parked his red truck right by the door  So he could get in without getting too cold  Yeah  Now he's got foam all over him  A big wing hits it  Alright, Anthony  We got the audio from the Groundhog Day thing  Oh, we do?  Because we weren't really sure what that stupid idiot was saying  Who, our caller?  Well, no, Teddy  Teddy did a pretty good job for us up there  Teasing him, of course  He did a bang-up job  Shows all over the country  Covering Groundhog Day 
[02:53:30]  Covering everything  Here's some highlights from the Groundhog Day  Banana phone  Banana phone  I'm Sabani Phil  King of the Groundhogs  Father of all Marmata  Seer of Seers  Prognosticator of prognosticators  Has been summoned by Groundhog President William Cooper  Lord of the Wasteland, Humongous  The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller  So that was the intro 
[02:54:00]  Then they recite some poem about disasters and tsunamis in general, I guess  Why is that?  I don't know what this has to do with a groundhog, but  He then turned to President William and in Groundhog East directed him to the scroll which reads  Natural disasters have been a terrible thing  Earthquakes, tsunamis, downpours, floods, landslides, heavy snowstorms, avalanches, frigid temperatures, sleet and freezing rain 
[02:54:30]  They cause much destruction, suffering and pain  When it seems like too much of which to cope, the coming of spring brings us new hope  Changing seasons are a wonderful thing  Now it's Groundhog Day and we think of spring  Will spring come early or will it come late?  It's time for me to prognosticate  The masturbate  Did he just write a poem  Time for me to masturbate  About the tsunamis?  I know  It didn't sound like it came out right  No 
[02:55:00]  It came out good  The milk  Good enough  I'm sorry  I'll blame it on the milk  Yes, Jimmy?  No, no  Blame it on the milk  What's that?  Did he just write a poem that involves tsunamis and avalanches to tie it in with this faggoty animal that might or may not see its shadow?  Yes, exactly  And what he was doing was the scroll is written down by somebody  It's transcribed  And the groundhog is supposed to be the one that tells this guy this stuff  And he writes it down 
[02:55:30]  So what he's reading is what the groundhog told him  Ah, so the groundhog was bothered by the over 200,000 deaths in the tsunami  And said, let's see what rhymes with that  Let's not use mommy, we've seen how that works out  We've seen that doesn't pan out very well  I hear the guy with the top hat got fired  And the guy with the cane  But the groundhog is keeping his job  Well, the groundhog is part Asian and kind of bailed out of the joke aspect  Yeah, he didn't find it funny at all  Ugh  And finally  But I'm sorry to say, I see my shadow today  Did I see my shadow? 
[02:56:00]  Six-year-old  I see my shadow today  He's only the messenger  Oh, I guess so  Don't kill the groundhog  Do you know what would really go well with that ceremony?  Mustard gas  I want to see Puxatawney Phil dead  I want to see all the people watching him dead  Is that the Puxatawney Phil audio?  At least we have it, that's good  From Puxatawney Phil's scroll  I shall read 
[02:56:30]  Please don't get my milk from Dwayne Reed  I know it's Reed and Reed and Jimmy doesn't like that, but fuck him  Hey, I gave you 20 minutes of material today  Alright, what a dumb little tradition they got there  It's horrendous  At Hob My Knob or whatever the place is called  Gobbler's Hob  Gobbler's Knob  Gobbler's Knob  Gobbler's Knob  Wow  And they say what happens is Monster Rain comes  And if Phil goes under the porch  There's six more weeks of humiliation and self-hatred 
[02:57:00]  Anthony, quick celebrity news  Oh, I love celebrity news  I think we know why  Doesn't Miss Info do this?  Yeah, really  I think we know why Jay Moore has not called the program yet  He's too busy chasing tail  Never stopped him before  Yeah  And page six is this little item  It says more or less 
[02:57:30]  More or less  I'm sure it's spelt like his last name  More or less  Very clever when they do that  Las Vegas hottie  Nikki Cox  Nikki Cox, yes  She's really hot and she's in that show Las Vegas, okay  Has broken off her engagement to Bobcat Goldthwait  They've been going out for years  Really?  Yeah, they were going out  Like they had some dopey Fox show together, didn't they?  Do you remember what that was called?  Unhappily ever after  Unhappily ever after  It didn't involve a puppet  But before 
[02:58:00]  Yeah  But before Bobcat  She was going out with one of the other guys from that show  The little midget guy  Because I remember like VH1 or something did a little show with Nikki Cox at home  Really?  And she had this like kind of trolly short guy that she was going out with  And then I guess she made it big and said, see you later pal  And then went out with Bobcat who was engaged to her  And wow, now it seems Jay Moore  But this is odd because Jay Moore is married  And just recently had a kid or a kid within the last year or two, right? 
[02:58:30]  Had a kid  He did nothing but praise and dote over his wife on the show  Had her on the show  Nicole, yeah  Had her on the show a few times  And they seemed like the perfect couple  Well, I don't know what's going on because we haven't talked to Jay in a very long time  But basically it says that Nikki Cox broke off her engagement to Bobcat Goldthwait  That is now dating another comic, Jay Moore  Wow  Dating?  So it's not just me  Dating another comic, Jay Moore  Cox and Goldthwait dated for five years after meeting on Unhappily Ever After 
[02:59:00]  But Cox should be careful of Moore, whom she met on Las Vegas, the TV show  The comic was at Sundance, hitting on every woman in sight, our spies say  Last adulterer standing  At one point Moore waltzed into the Converse suite at the Motorola Lodge  Looked at a young woman and leered  You should be on film while trying to touch her  The indie actress shot back  I already am  He tries that at a film festival 
[02:59:30]  You should be on film  Everyone there is pitching movies  That Jay is really slick  Jeez  He actually said that to Cape Capshaw  Cape?  I did say Cape Capshaw, did I?  Yes, you did  Ah, Cape Capshaw  Somebody strap a bomb to me  I'm going to a Pauley station  Get me my Cape Capshaw  Well, that's actually a little place on the coast of New England 
[03:00:00]  I love that  Where talentless women who bang big directors live  I'm going to go home tonight and rent Kate Fear  I love that movie  Come on, hurt me  I'm an easy target  You're fantastic  What are you writing, Steve?  Steve? 
[03:00:30]  What are you writing there?  I got some audio  You're jotting a lot of stuff down  I'd love to know what it is  Writing something on a CD  What you got, Steve?  Sarah Jessica Parker calls ONA  There you go  Wow!  It's really long, though  It is  Give it a listen  Give it a little listen  We could hear from the beginning  I'm sure she says where she is  That's the actual call  And it verifies exactly who she is in the first few seconds  Let's all listen in  Yeah, so  Let's give it a dang quick  Yeah, if you're tuning in  Just listen to the replay  Because we explained this whole thing earlier  Yep  That's the beauty of the show 
[03:01:00]  Just going over and over again  Yeah, we're not going to waste time  Explaining it to you  Right  Not you  Not you  I'm not going to explain it to you  You oversleeper  What?  What?  Sarah Jessica Parker  Hey  Hey  Who's this?  You're not Sarah Jessica Parker  See, at this point we're like  Alright, it's one of our goofy callers  Going, oh yeah  I'll make believe I'm Sarah Jessica Parker  Meanwhile, it sounds just like Sarah Jessica Parker  Because it is Sarah Jessica Parker  Oh, these are the fellas that were just trashing me 
[03:01:30]  Are these the guys?  Are you Sarah Jessica Parker?  I am indeed  Now, how do you prove that?  How do I prove it?  I don't know  How does one prove their identity with the phone?  It does sound a lot like you  I gotta say that  Do you listen to our radio show?  No, I don't  As a matter of fact, my trailer driver had it on  And I was fortunate  Trailer driver?  Okay, trailer driver  I said she called from a trailer  You said she called from a cab  Yeah  You're out  But she said  Wait, wait  You're out  She said my trailer driver had it on 
[03:02:00]  That doesn't mean she's in the trailer right now  Is what I'm saying  Good punt  She could have gotten in a cab  And made the call or something  What the hell is a trailer driver?  I guess a driver  When you go on a movie set or a TV set  There's just trailers sitting there  Sex and the City  A lot of location shots around the city  So they probably cart her around  In a trailer?  And take her trailer with her  She's jumping in a limo  No, I know  But her trailer then  Probably goes from point A to point B  And it needs what they call a driver  Okay  See, and he drives the trailer  What do you think?  They hook the trailer up to the limo and pull it? 
[03:02:30]  I don't know  I thought you'd hook it up to a Ford pickup truck?  Hitch it up  No, track trailer  It's a trailer  The timing was absolutely  Just absolutely beautifully fortuitous for me  Sarah Jessica  Oh, she used the Bob Kelly word too  What?  She said fortuitous  Yeah, Bob's is foolish  I know  It was close  I was trying  No, because she used it correctly  And she did listen to the show live herself  No one told her  I told you  She was listening  I thought her trailer driver told her  The show happened to be on  That's what she said  It was perfect timing 
[03:03:00]  All right  It was just absolutely beautifully fortuitous for me  Sarah Jessica  I got to say  Your performance on the MTV  Movie Awards  Fantastic  I thought you did a great job  I loved the costume changes  Especially the one at the end  You're such a puss, Ann  What?  It's Sarah Jessica Parker  You don't have the ball  To actually say to me  What you said to your  Maybe limited audience  Come on, buddy  Limited audience?  Come on  We get more people listening to this show  Than watching that Sex and the City  Really? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah  Are you certain of that?  Positive  I watched  Hey, guys, listen  I watched  Take it easy  It's all right  You're absolutely entitled to an opinion  I just thought it would be  I just thought maybe I'd put a human face  To, you know, some trash talk  And I thought it would be helpful  To you to actually make it less abstract  And more of a person  I thought you were really hot in L.A. Story  Hello?  That means the world to me  Thank you  Thanks  So what do you guys do?  You're DJs on the air in New York City? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, yeah  Your chat show host  Yeah, that's all we do  We're not as famous as you or anything  Nah  You know  But listen  What I wanted to do  What I actually wanted to do  Because I actually don't know you guys  And I don't actually listen to the radio  Only because I don't have time  Not because I'm an elitist  Or I think I'm above it  I simply don't listen to the radio that much  Yeah  But what I thought I might do  Since you've hurt my feelings so terribly  And since I actually am a person with feelings  And you seem to have an idea about me  That I'm sort of hideous and awful  Hold on  Wow 
[03:04:30]  If she wanted to put a human face on it  Why not have somebody with a human face call  As opposed to somebody whose head was in The Godfather  Stupid thoroughbred  You're going to make her call again, aren't you?  Hold on  Okay  What do I do?  Let me finish  What does she want to do?  Let me have mine  What do I do?  What do I do is  I would invite you to the set  If you're interested in coming  We're shooting in New York City  As you know  With our tiny little audience show  It's called Sex in the City  Which is just bigger than ever  I saw the season premiere 
[03:05:00]  And I enjoyed the whole Staten Island thing  You guys did this past week  Thank you  Well thanks  That's big of you  Thank you  What I do is  If you guys are brave enough  I thought perhaps  You might want to come to the set  And pay a visit  And actually see that  I'm not a deformed  Awful looking person  Oh my  Wait, wait  And he said  It actually  Actually  It forced me  It forced me to toot my own horn  And I will say this  We didn't take it that far  I've never been one  That had been accused  Of being stilted 
[03:05:30]  In her speaking  I've made numerous appearances  On Letterman  For God knows how many years  Sarah, you seemed a little stiff  Sarah  I'd hardly be accused  Of being a stiff person  Wait, we're just too  Let me just  Let me finish  We're just two schmucks  On the radio  Let her finish  What does it matter  What we say  Let her finish  We have personal  We have personal taste  That's all  It's a daunting experience  To be the host  Right  Of an award show  When one has not made a living  Nor a practice of doing that  And I think that perhaps  If you met me  You might actually discover  That you like me 
[03:06:00]  And you might actually  Be on my side  You want to come down today?

[03:11:00]  I'm not going to jump on your side  No but I'm just  I'm just giving my opinions again  Like  She was naked through that  Whole first episode  And I wasn't  I wasn't feeling it  I was hoping you were going to  Get naked with that politician  I'll never get naked  I never have  And I never will  No?  It was pretty close last night  On the movie awards  Alright why don't you  Please get the information  So I can go to set  And not get fired  Okay  Alright thanks guys  Alright  Thank you  Bye  Well you know  She's got some balls there  Comes calling up  And defending herself 
[03:11:30]  Wow I haven't heard that  In a long time  Yeah  That was the weirdest thing  End of the controversy  She was on set  I don't know why  After all this time  I thought she was in a cab  But okay  Rocky in Long Island  She was taken around  On a horse trailer  My favorite part was that  Oh you guys hate being called  Shock jocks  And twice heard that thing  You're like  We're just two dopey  Shock jocks  Shock jocks  Well that was years ago  And I think I was saying it  You know  Like we're shock jocks  You know but  Ed from Jersey  Go ahead Ed  She's not elitist  About listening to radio  But she sure is elitist 
[03:12:00]  About thinking she's  Better looking than Ruth Buzzy  I guess she doesn't think  Ruth Buzzy has feelings  Good point  End of that story  You know she ended up  Blowing us off  Of course we did  Because we did try to  Go down on the set  Yeah  Alright we gotta take a break  And continue  We got Bob Kelly  Outside the studio  Made him wait way too long  So he'll bitch about that  I'm sure  And we got lots of other  Things to get to  I think we found your song  The Paralyzed song  Yeah the  It's done to kryptonite  It's a Christopher Reeve tribute  Alright we'll play it  After the break  Alright Opie 
[03:12:30]  It is a natural impulse  To grab and squeeze  Squeeze the breasts  Squeeze the breasts  No shit  It's real real soft  Almost like pudding  Almost like pudding  Yes  A hot piece of ass  Quite a handful  Yeah  The nipples are so sensitive  Yeah  That a near tweak  Between finger and thumb  Will give a perfectly good result  We all be an Anthony show  In case you didn't know  God forbid they should put a few radio stations  Anywhere between here and Salt Lake City 
[03:13:00]  For God's sake  You hit your scan button  It's like playing roulette without the ball  It just spins and spins  Get a choice of static or national public radio  Let me flip a fucking coin  You're now listening to national public radio  We'll now go live to Liechtenstein  For a concert from a cafe  Where Jan's Cheska-Honavonavonavonavonavitz 
[03:13:30]  Is playing a dulcimer  Strung only with scrotum hair  This is national public radio  Don't fall asleep at the wheel  I blew a speaker in my car today  That sucked  Yeah, he was a motivational speaker  Left a bad taste in my mouth  But I feel a lot more positive 
[03:14:00]  It's the weirdest thing  I am  Oh my gracious  You know what I hate  The one thing I hated growing up  More than anything else  I hated being tickled  Tickling is the worst  Because it started off fun  Right?  Tickling started  Tickling!  What's tickle?  Started fun  Ended horribly  Didn't it always escalate the same way?  At first you'd be like  I can't breathe 
[03:14:30]  I can't breathe  Cut it out  Stop it  I'm gonna throw up  And they couldn't stop  They were like  I don't care  I had to punch my grandmother in the chest  Take it off  Take it off  The virus is out  I repeat  The virus is out  The virus is spreading

[03:19:00]  We gotta figure out  Yes you can  Every day just before we go to the phones  We have to just play a clip of this  You gotta get the other part  Where he goes  Banana phone  That's the beginning right?  Yeah  Right here  Ring ring ring ring ring ring  Banana phone  Ring ring ring ring ring ring  Banana phone  Right there  Every time  That's hysterical  It'll drive everyone nuts  And that's our job on this program  It really will be a  Ring ring ring ring  A pickaxe in the ear  That is horrible 
[03:19:30]  That's when we take phone calls from Chocolate City  We'll play it  What a happy tune that is though  Oh jeez  You know  I'm gonna join Rick Delgado  Yeah no that was bad  Banana phone  Banana phone  Banana phone  What's up man  Hey Bob  Bob  You know what  Go Pat's Ghoul  You had me sitting out there  Trust me  Trust me  We know what we're doing  An hour and a half  Trust me  We know what we're doing 
[03:20:00]  It was like  Wow  No it's a half hour with Master Poe  In prison now  Yeah  Because he actually takes your mug shot against the wall  Does he really?  Yeah you have to  He took my mug shot  Why is he taking everyone's pictures?  For what?  Unless he wants a photo  And then sitting on that  Could you get books or something  Or something out in that little thing  Aren't they as comfy as like airport waiting  I feel like I'm waiting for the dentist  There's nobody out there  I'm just a lonely ass  Looking in at you guys  Giggling and laughing  And then five minutes later  I actually hear it 
[03:20:30]  And every once in a while  You hear Bob Kelly  And I get excited  And then you're on to something else  I'm sitting there like  Holy shit  I really am nothing in this business  We are bad  We just felt like you had nothing to offer  As far as what we were doing at that time  What do I need to be fat  And talk about XXL over and over  To sit in the room  Can I just sit on the couch and listen?  That is true  That is very funny  Not him  Fat Ralphie May  Oh Ralphie  That's like XXXL  We got a lot of fat  You know 
[03:21:00]  Friends of the show  I don't know  I just want to  Can the next time  Can I just sit on the couch  And just be part of  I won't even talk to the mic  Let him just sit there  I see no problem with that  We'll think about it  Oh you mother fucker  You know what  I really  Oh  Opie you are  You know I still want to kick your dog right?  Why would you want to kick my dog?  It's a little silky  It's what he does  It's all he does  We were at the Brooklyn Diner  After Bob Kelly's last appearance  And I just casually said  Can I kick your dog?  Not hard  I just want to tap it  Just annoy it a little bit 
[03:21:30]  Bring back memories  Just a little bit  Not enough to hurt it  Just enough to just like  My dog weighs nine pounds  I know  There's no way you have that much control  In your foot  Just a tiny little  To kick it a little tiny bit  I just want to poke it  Why?  Do you want to poke it  So it doesn't even notice  Or give that little  Just enough  No just not even that  Just enough where the dog  Is just annoyed a little  Annoyed a little at you  That you did that  Yeah I just like  Where he turns his head  And looks up at you  Like hey  What are you doing?  You're not going to kick my dog  You ass  Just a little  What's wrong with you? 
[03:22:00]  Just a little bit  You're sadistic  Those dogs are nice  Jim Norton loves my  We talked about this  For like 20 minutes  At the Brooklyn Diner  And I was dead serious  Just a little tap  He's crazy  The little  Jimmy loves my little dog  And my little dog  Loves Jimmy  The dog does love me  I can't allow it to be kicked  I sent that video to Steve  Actually  This jackass  Came to my house  After the show  And fell asleep  And he's snoring on my couch  Yeah  So I get my video camera  And I'm taping him snoring  Then I look at my dog  Who loves Jimmy  And he's just staring  At his crotch 
[03:22:30]  So I pan down  This creep  Has a full-fledged rod  While he's sleeping  On a pair of sweats  On a pair of sweats  And my dog's just staring at it  Like a rat  Like a little toy  Like he's dying  Just to bite it  I was so appalled  I'm just like  Ugh  And then I wake him up  And he's like  That sleep apnea  And then he just goes  Right back to sleep  I don't like the fact  That you put off  Your homoerotic stare  At my mule  On the dog  While the dog  Was looking  And the dog  Directed me to look 
[03:23:00]  The dog went  Bob look  Do we have that video Steve  It will be online  Later today  Oh god  It's awful  Is it funny  You can really tell  Is he sporting  And all that  I've seen that  Norton's got  He's got an alright  Size mule  I mean  It's pretty good  And he has sweatpants on  And you just see my dog  Staring at his cock  And then he looks up at me  And he's like  Why  The dog should have  Just lunged  And bit into it  How funny would that be  To catch on tape 
[03:23:30]  Not particularly  If I can voice an opinion  For the people watching  Banana phone  Let's go to the phone Anthony 
[03:24:00]  And talk to  Banana in the sweats  Let's talk to Kev TV  From Wackbag  Kev TV  What's up  What's up boys  Hey man  How's it going  Good  What's going on  Yeah I sent that song  To Steve C  I figured that song  Was bothering me  For about the past week  Or so  So why not bother  Every single ONA listener  Really  Where'd you get it from  The absolute worst thing  You could ever imagine  To listen to  Like I've heard it  One time  And it's been in my head  For about eight days

[03:29:30]  Oh that's cool  You know  I usually don't do this  To do comedy shows  She goes  Oh no  I'm a big fan  Which never happens to me  I never get a girl  Never mind a chick  With huge tits  In Vegas  Go I'm a fan  Right  You know  I'm a fan  Just doesn't happen that much  Unless it's you know  You know  Some fucking intern  From the ONA show  Might go  Hey I heard you before  But it's never a chick  So I'm like  Get out of here  And I'm thinking  She you know  Saw me with Norton  Or somebody else  Or Dane  Right  You know  The story of my life  Yeah I saw you open  For somebody  So uh  She didn't go 
[03:30:00]  Not you  Oh Jesus  I'm a big fan  Oh thank you  Not you  Do you know how many IM's  I get now  Hey man great job  And then I go thanks  And they go  Not you  It hurts even in text  And they put capitals  Of course they do  Exclamation points  They suck  So I'm like really  She goes yeah  I saw you in Tough Crowd  And you know  I really am a big fan of yours  I'm like wow that's great  And uh  Listen to what he decides  He needs to say now 
[03:30:30]  In my head  There's two ways  To go about it  I'm either gonna  Try to get her up  To my  You know hey  Let's hang out  Or she's a porn star  Right  I'm thinking  That I just go for the  You know  Why don't we go up  To my uh  Why don't we go up  To my room  I just you know  Go right for it  Right go right for it  So I say go right for it  Be confident  So I says listen  You know  I go uh  Listen to this  She goes  You know  Do you have any CDs  I go yeah  As a matter of fact  I got CDs up in my room  Good move  Good move  So she goes  Oh really  So far so good  Yeah 
[03:31:00]  She didn't you know  So I go  Why don't we go upstairs  You know what I'd love to do  Uh oh  I go let me just cut to the chase  I just want to go upstairs  And maybe eat your ass  And you lick my ass  That's all I want to do  That's all I want  Right  And you're thinking  Because this is normal  Because she's a porn star  Right  She's a porn star  Like porn stars do anything  Anytime  Of course  Yeah  I mean  Yeah  I mean you're  You do do this  For a fucking living  Right  Exactly  So I'm like  And I  I kind of leaned in  And whispered in her ear 
[03:31:30]  And I kind of leaned back out  To look at her face  All sexy  Look at her face  And she's like  I don't think so  And I was like  Well you know  You know  I'm just  Maybe I'll just  You know  I can just  Maybe lick your ass  That's all I want to do  And I'm starting to try  And she's like  I don't know  I don't think so  I go  I got a CD upstairs  Why don't you come up  Upstairs  There you go  And she's like  No  I can't  Oh now you've ruined  The whole  Even come upstairs thing  Then I start panicking  I'm like  No no no no  Seriously  I have CDs upstairs  Why don't you just

That he didn't want to live?  Yeah railroad  Didn't want to live?  No because first of all  This only happened in 2001  And second of all  We've been separated since 1991  My son was only about maybe one or two years old  There you go  That's all I could say 
[03:37:30]  Did he do it on purpose?  Or did he trip over a treadmill by the train tracks?  I have no clue  Did he trip over a treadmill?  No he did not trip over a treadmill  All right thanks  Okay  Thank you  That's all I'm going to tell you  Well what else is there to tell us?  Well you know what else can I say?

[03:38:00]  Sorry Bob  We've been trying to get to the bottom of that story for a while  You know what her husband's dead?  It wasn't her husband  Like I don't know  The dude like got her knocked up  They had a kid together  And then I don't know  The kid was like  Did he hold a rock over her head?  What happened was the guy woke up one morning  And saw what he had slept with the night before  And you know  The next thing you know  She's pregnant  She has a kid  And the guy 10 years later  Jumped in front of a train  So we're trying to figure out what happened  He jumped in front of a train?  Yeah  Or walked in front of one  Jesus  Or he might have like 
[03:38:30]  I don't know  Skipped  Might have skipped  Yeah  Why she's  I've never seen  I don't think I've ever seen Lady Di  Haven't I?  Is she ugly?  She's not bad  I mean she  It's Oliver Hardy  Watch Oliver Hardy  From Laurel and Hardy  And it is Oliver Hardy  With tits  Are the same size  No same size  Exactly  Same body  Same face  Same hair  Everything  My husband went in front of a train  He was annoyed with my antics 
[03:39:00]  And had to kill himself  He'd rather take a locomotive  Than a pie in the fence  What an awful thing  Fiddling with her blubber on her neck  Like it was a necktie  I have to go find a job  So I may get my son back  Choo choo 
[03:39:30]  There goes my husband  Dead  Holy shit  Oh what a mess  She is awful  How the fuck  That mustache  We pencil in a mustache on her  To a tee  Give her a derby hat  That's all  God we should have gotten a derby  They did actually  They did paint a mustache on her  That used to be my favorite thing  In the old show  When she would walk in  And that awful  Laurel and Hardy music  Would play  Oh it would start playing 
[03:40:00]  It's hysterical  The visual  It's amazing  She looks just like him  Can you get a picture of her  For Bob  Is it possible  Yeah  Is she really  I like fat chicks though  Not this one  I've been with some pretty fat chicks man  She's a flatso  She's got like the fat  But the boobs didn't  Get fat too  She's not proportionally fat  Just a big mess  That greasy straight hair  That you'd expect to see  On a mongoloid bomber in Iraq  She's got throw mama from the train hair  It's actually that  Throw husband in front of a train  Throw husband in front of a train 
[03:40:30]  Why don't we take a break  We'll finish the show  With Bob Kelly  Excuse me my good man  When does the next train come through  We'll play the paralyzed song  Before we get out of here  Okay  Also hookers are getting caught  That advertise on Craigslist  I know they're dumb  We'll try to like squeeze  A lot of stuff in  In the last break  But first  Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring  Banana phone  Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring

[03:42:30]  Pulling a big trailer  Then it's 55 miles an hour  And they do this, of course  Because having everybody drive  The same speed on the same road  Just doesn't make sense  I'm surprised they make them  Drive the same direction  How about you? 
[03:43:00]  I couldn't spell  When I was a little kid  I couldn't spell  So my parents got all concerned  So they went down to the toy store  They bought me a little red box  Called Speak and Spell  You remember that?

[03:46:00]  She had nothing  I've actually done girls bigger than her  Oh yeah, Bob Kelly's taking a look at her  Really  I swear to God  I actually did a girl so big  I was on top of her in the bed  And both my knees didn't touch the bed  It was like fucking an upside down canoe  It was, I was in Houston  It was a black chicken  It was, I had to stay an extra night  And I went to the movies with all these black girls in Houston  It was, it was crazy  And this one big black chick  How'd you hook up with them? 
[03:46:30]  Well, they were just taking me out  I was there with Tracy Morgan  Yeah  And I had to stay an extra night  Because of the flight  So the next day they took me to a barbecue church  Yeah  And, you know, it was all this southern stuff  And taking me out of the black parts of town  How'd you know they wanted to take you out?  Did they call you?  Yeah, they called me up  And then I went to the movies  And this chick had a sundress on  It, oh  Oh my God  Don't you dare  And she called me up on the phone  She goes  Called you on the phone?  Yeah, my room  She goes, what you doing? 
[03:47:00]  And then she started singing this song  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring  Banana phone  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring  Banana phone  She sang that song  That's how I got her back to the room  I had a banana phone  Alright, so she calls you up  To watch you go to the movies  So I got this  She called me on the phone  She goes, would you?

I said  Nothing  She goes  You want me to come over?  I went  Sure  Two seconds later  It was a knock on my door  She called me from her cell phone  Outside the door  Cell phone?  I had a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos  In my room  As she walks in  Sits down  Grabs the Cool Ranch  Yeah 
[03:49:00]  Starts eating them  I'm just lying there petrified  And I had those pull away sweatpants  Yeah  So she basically started grabbing my conch with one hand  Eating Doritos with the other  Eating Doritos  I got a hard on  I'm just lying there still as a  Just lying there not moving  Then she just grabs my sweatpants  And rips them off like a silverback gorilla  Jesus  What?  And she  Bob  Alright, whatever  You gotta put some emphasis into the story  You're starting to phone it in  So  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring 
[03:49:30]  Banana phone  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring  Banana phone  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring  I don't know  All these think villages sound the same to me  My foot can't  It won't stop tapping  So she's eating Doritos  I really 
[03:50:00]  I'm gonna let you kick my dog  So she just  I just got on top of her  And I almost  I almost fell off  How much do you think she weighed?  She's probably over three  Yeah  Yeah, but I was in Houston  It was Houston on a Saturday stay over  Like you're on  Mars where they're lighter  What are you gonna do?  You're in Houston  So it's 300 pounds  Her tit was so big  I had to hold it with two hands  And I actually  This is the only time in my life  She was blowing me  And I actually stopped her 
[03:50:30]  I went  I can't do this  I actually got morals  Shoot up Doritos  Scraping you  It was just the size of our areola  Was the size of my head  Did you have to take your two hands  To make it look like a boob?  Just leave a little poke out the thumb  And they're so flat  That you gotta shape your own boob  For yourself  It was huge  You got great breasts  That's my arm  Wow, that was just a great story  Thanks  Aw, Jesus  That was really good  What are you gonna do?  I've been with a lot of fat girls in my life 
[03:51:00]  Yes  We got the Paralyzed song  That we promised  Oh, goody  I don't know what this is  It's a parody of  Three Doors Down, Kryptonite  We were talking about song parodies  And how  This to me is a brilliantly written one  I just don't know how clear the audio is  But I listen to this  I just love the way this is written  It stays true to the song  Is it really like  Offensive and bad?  No, it's just  So well  It's clean  And it's so well  It's everything a song parody should be  But it's about Christopher Reeve?  Yeah  Oh, then it's gotta be really offensive  It's not pleasant  But there's an audience  Don't clap 
[03:51:30]  I hope that's not the vocal  I took a ride one day  My hopes to ease my troubled mind  I hadn't landed a decent role  Since I made it somewhere inside of  I couldn't get a job  Unless I wore a blue and red suit  I felt there's no  Nothing I could do  Yeah  You know what I'm going with this? 
[03:52:00]  Yeah  There you go  Then suddenly that wall stopped short  That stupid thorough breath  My hands were tangled in the rock  I landed right on my head  I can tell that I had done some major harm  Cause now I can't feel my legs on my arms  If I'm gonna lock my horse  When you sit and call me super 
[03:52:30]  I go super afraid  I'm never gonna walk again  The only things I move are my lips and eyes  Cause I'm paralyzed  That is horrid  It's well written  It's a great parody  I just wish the audio was clearer  That's pretty funny  Someone will find that for us  Yeah please do  Cause I think the guy's name is Eric Snyder or something  I really want that whole song  Off my horse  Would you still call me super man?  Dude I broke two vertebrae  I'm never gonna walk again 
[03:53:00]  That's just great  That's just great  What a sicko  But that's what a song parody can be vicious  As long as it's well written  Alright  Poor Todd Lynn  Then we got audio of Hillary Swank  Talking about how she took a CPR class  Yeah  And then what?  Why is that good?  She's bragging about how she had this dream  That she was meant to save somebody's life  So she took a CPR class  So that it would happen  And then she went to do CPR  And it didn't work  Eric  Oof  Your hand off 
[03:53:30]  My hand off your mule  Thanks  What were you  I had my hand on the chair  And he just put his cock right against it  And was talking to the microphone  He was just  Well good move to patiently tell him  Instead of just moving your hand away  I was taught in an emergency  To relax and stay calm  And rub a guy's mule if you have to  Would you please rock back and forth  Until  Bob knows that Eric is known to talk a lot  So I think he would just enjoy himself  I just feel his banana phone for a little while  I was dreaming a lot that I was going to have to 
[03:54:00]  Save someone's life  And I thought  I'm not going to ignore this dream anymore  And I got certified in CPR  And I'd say  Three months after that  Someone collapsed in an airport  He had had a heart attack  And wasn't getting  He was dying  So I just  Administered CPR  And  Told the paramedics  Could get there  We didn't live 
[03:54:30]  And I got his heart going  And  I mean I kept  I didn't get his heart going  But I  Acted as his heart  Pumping his chest  Maybe you should stop dreaming  You bitch  Jesus  Maybe you should just get on your plane  Just walk  Get on your plane  Get on your plane at Teterboro  And hit a building  You melodramatic whore  Shut up  Jesus  That's pretty epic funny  That's what you want 
[03:55:00]  When you're going out  Is to look up and think  Oh great  Hillary Swank's got to save my life  Yeah next time  Take a sleeping pill  And leave the saving time  Jesus  He didn't live  Yeah maybe there was somebody  That was more capable  That looked and went  Well she seems to have things in hand  Hillary Swank  Boys don't cry  Apparently they don't know CPR either  Do they stupid ass  Oh  I tried CPR  But I didn't notice he was choking  Oh we don't have time to play this  Oh 
[03:55:30]  The hooker's getting caught  We'll have to save her tomorrow  Can I just say  That I really stunk today  But it's  It's not my fault  I like your story  Hang on one second  Hang on one second  I thought I was coming in here  To talk about the midgets  Oh right  We have midget audio  Oh my god  We haven't gone to it for a while  Yeah we haven't gotten to that  Remember that midget thing  Right  Right  Midget special  Now you remind us  Well  It's your show  Dude I  We're stupid  You should have sat out there  And told someone  That's the reason you were here  I thought you were here
