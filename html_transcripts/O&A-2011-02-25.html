<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with an extensive discussion of Charlie Sheen's firing from "Two and a Half Men," fueled by audio clips from his erratic interview with Alex Jones.  The hosts dissected Sheen's boastful and bizarre pronouncements, his drug use admissions, and his attacks on the show's creators, using frequent expletives. They debated whether Jones was exploiting Sheen for ratings and speculated on the future of "Two and a Half Men," as well as the possibility of a "Major League 3" film.  The hosts also briefly recounted their own past caffeine abuse and Anthony's recent YouTube cooking video.  Troy Kwan was mentioned as a potential source of information on Sheen's relationship with Alex Jones.  Sound clips from Sheen's TMZ interview were also played, leading to further offensive commentary from the hosts.  The hosts then shared a bizarre anecdote about a "fourth-dimensional" *Jaws* viewing experience on a yacht.

The show then transitioned into a segment featuring listener calls and various tangents. This included graphic and speculative commentary about the revolutions in Egypt and Libya, specifically Muammar Gaddafi’s fate, and the hosts' inaccurate past predictions concerning these events.  Humorous, and often crude, speculation about Libyan drug use followed, alongside a debate on the reliability of news reporting.  A lengthy and vulgar discussion about flatulence ensued, including a call with a microbiologist who debunked a caller's claim about unique fart smells.  The segment concluded with listener accounts of aggressive vendors in tourist destinations, particularly in Egypt and Morocco.  Patrice O'Neal and Pat Cooper were mentioned as upcoming guests. The hosts also referenced a previous interview with Donald Rumsfeld where Louis C.K. questioned if he was a lizard, and brainstormed various t-shirt ideas.

The next segment focused on negative experiences with tourist traps and the smells and experiences of fatherhood. Opie detailed a trip to Morocco where he was forced into buying a rug, leading to ten days of diarrhea in Europe.  He shared similar experiences on a cruise, highlighting his aversion to coerced tours.  The hosts discussed kickbacks received by drivers and tour operators. A caller, Mike, shared a humorous anecdote from a baby book, leading to a vulgar discussion about baby feces, naked children on beaches, and inappropriate behavior at child beauty pageants like "Toddlers in Tiaras" and "Little Miss Perfect," including sexually suggestive outfits and dance moves. The hosts even proposed creating their own such pageant.  Dr. Steve then joined, participating in a hypothetical scenario about identifying silent farts, leading to a discussion about the Medical MythBusters show and a previous experiment debunking the vodka-soaked tampon myth. Dr. Steve also shared a grim anecdote from his time as a medical examiner.  The conversation shifted to the relative fame of Louis C.K. and Chris Rock, segueing into a discussion of Adam Sandler’s comedic career.  Patrice O'Neal then joined the studio.  The show concluded this section with a discussion of a controversial Boston Celtics trade, with O'Neal expressing strong disapproval and analyzing the team's strategic decisions, alongside commentary on Carmelo Anthony's trade to the New York Knicks and the reactions of other players.  A caller, Stryker, shared his opinions on the trades and Carmelo's wife's alleged influence.

The following segment began with speculation on a celebrity couple's relationship, focusing on the woman's perceived domineering influence and her reality TV success. The conversation then turned to Denver Nuggets coach George Karl, his weariness, and his team's tattooed players, specifically a highly critical and detailed description of Chris "Birdman" Anderson's neck tattoos, eliciting amusement and bewilderment from the hosts and Patrice O'Neal.  Pat Cooper then joined in-studio.  The ensuing conversation was rambling and profane, covering Pat Cooper's career frustrations, his negative opinions on modern comedy, his views on athlete salaries and tax write-offs, and his experiences with agents and managers.  He also recounted a highly detailed, humorous, and sexually explicit childhood experience. The segment included numerous insults and personal anecdotes from Pat Cooper, along with interjections and commentary from Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O'Neal.  The segment concluded with a continued discussion of Cooper's career and longevity in comedy.

The final segment featured Pat Cooper as a guest, primarily dominated by his vulgar and rambling anecdotes, punctuated by strong language and frequent interruptions.  He discussed his career, opinions on other comedians (Jerry Seinfeld, Jerry Lewis, Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Jason Alexander), his Hollywood experiences, and his views on aging and the entertainment industry.  He recounted several stories involving famous figures using highly profane language.  He also discussed his book and an upcoming audio version, touching upon his health, including his views on erectile dysfunction and aging, in explicit terms.  He mentioned upcoming shows.  Notable moments included his vivid and outrageous stories about Robert De Niro, including a claim of making De Niro urinate on himself during a film, and anecdotes about other celebrities.  The segment concluded with promotions for his book and shows, along with a humorous, albeit explicit, discussion about erectile dysfunction.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You're the crazier, the better.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How are you?  How are you?  Are we ready to broadcast?  Yes.  There it is.  Why don't you do coffee in the morning?  That's always bothered me about you. 
[00:01:30]  I don't know.  I kind of got off of coffee in the morning.  But I don't think I ever was on coffee in the morning.  I like, uh, like a nice espresso after some dinner or something like that.  But when we first met, I got just so addicted to coffee.  But we were drinking coffee at eight o'clock at night.  It just didn't make sense.  Giant cups.  Giant cups.  Giant cups of coffee.  Oh, it didn't stop.  And the buzz that would carry over when you're trying to sleep.  Your head's ringing. 
[00:02:00]  It was awful.  I went through two pots of coffee when I was doing my night show at BAB.  And anyone associated with that show had to drink coffee.  Yeah, just pounding down coffee.  I don't even know why.  I don't know why that made sense.  Less shaking.  Yeah, like you said, then you go home and you can't sleep.  And then I was telling someone I ran into in the supermarket,  because they were grabbing a Red Bull and a cup of coffee first thing in the morning.  This was over the weekend.  And I was telling them there was a time, and maybe you remember, you do remember. 
[00:02:30]  Remember the water at AAF?  What was it called?  Yeah, it was called something 2-0.  It was caffeinated water.  Yeah.  And we used to drink the caffeinated water at AAF when we were doing afternoon drive.  And then we decided that wasn't good enough.  Do you remember we made coffee with the caffeinated water?  Coffee with the caffeinated water.  This shit would get your...  You would see like...  Crank 2-0.  Crank 2-0, was it?  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, I guess so.  You're right.  Crank 2-0.  Remember you would just get white flashes?  Because you had so much caffeine in you.  I don't know what that was.  A synapse misfiring and your fucking...  The blood cells in your retina is just bursting open from the blood pressure.  I remember I would get white flashes, and I'm thinking to myself...  What was that?  Maybe it's the Crank 2-0 coffee mix we're doing.  Using words like bertation.  Yeah.  Right.  But we should probably get right into the Charlie Sheen thing. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, God.  Charlie Sheen, CBS shuts down production of Two and a Half Men.  That means the show's over.  He's a hero.  He is a hero.  Is he a hero?  Some people think he's a hero.  He is amazing.  I find him amazing.  Yeah, why?  Because he so doesn't give a shit anymore.  Well, he has so much fucking money, so...  Yeah, the cash, the fucking...  The whores.  I think the guy is a hero, meaning a guy in general. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  If you have no money and you do that...  Oh, okay.  And you just throw everything away to just...  He has nothing to lose.  His life.  You're going to have that same rant in another year or two.  Is that going to be me?  Like, yeah, fuck it.  Because you're going to have nothing to lose, either.  I don't care.  I mean, how much money do you think he has in the bank?  He's got to have $20,000, $30,000.  I think you're about right.  Right.  Because none of us feel like doing that bit anymore.  No, I know. 
[00:04:30]  I think you're kind of right.  He knows who he is, and I would have to say he's probably a hero as well.  There are times when he's talking where he sounds like, wow, this guy is just taking  the opposite tack that anyone else in Hollywood would take.  He's not doing the usual Hollywood bullshit line of, yeah, I need rehab, I'm going to get  some help, a statement put out by his manager or something.  He is a fucking cokehead drunk and doesn't give a shit who knows it. 
[00:05:00]  And not only that, he seems proud of it.  Now, he doesn't give a shit because he's too far gone, you think, or he doesn't give  a shit because...  I think it's too far gone.  You think that's what it is?  When I heard his last rant about the fact that he tried sobriety and it was boring as  hell, and he could not do it, and the fact that he, that first drink he had after, how  many years was he sober?  He said something like...  I forgot.  12, was it?  Is it in the audio we're going to play?  I don't think so. 
[00:05:30]  I think it's in the previous audio.  Oh, the previous audio.  Yeah.  I'm not sure, but however long that sobriety was, he said that first drink he took after  that was the best thing ever.  Best drink ever?  Like, he was just being honest.  And then last night when I was listening to this audio, he's lambasting AA and the founder,  whoever the guy's name is, and calling them pussies and quitters, and he's not going to  sit there and deal with that bullshit, give up stuff.  Well, I think the AA people are going to be really fucking pissed off as well. 
[00:06:00]  Oh yeah, he's just spreading the fucking...  That one's rough.  Like, who gives a fuck?  The truth of Charlie Sheen.  Who cares if he goes after the creators of the Two and a Half Men and the network?  Who cares?  You almost, you have to be behind him with a sword for that shit.  You're supposed to just give everything up?  Right.  Fuck that.  Right.  He's like, I'm not fucking giving everything up.  I've discussed that with people.  I think there are people out there that they don't have anything if they're not partying.  Yeah.  I mean, there's people that the partying is affecting everything, and then they get their 
[00:06:30]  shit together, and they're able to have a better life.  But then I also think there are people out there, that's what they want.  And they...  That's just it.  And they know their lives, this is so not a cool thing to say, but, and they know their  lives are just extremely boring without it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, they don't want to pick up golf or some other fucking, you know, thing.  Like, you're supposed to hang out with sober people, or you're supposed to get away from  the crowd that you were hanging out with when you get sober, and he hangs out with prostitutes 
[00:07:00]  and strippers and porn stars.  I've not met a single one that doesn't drink and do drugs.  They're all just party animals.  Where's he going to find, like, hookers and fucking porn stars that don't do drugs and  drink?  Well, he's got to get rid of all those people.  And then what?  Hang out with churchgoers?  Yeah, yeah.  And he's supposed to be happy? 
[00:07:30]  And go to AA meetings.  Logically, that doesn't make sense to me.  And hold hands like he was talking about, like, and just relinquish your personality.  Yeah.  That's like his, these are his words.  Yeah, I know, I know.  You know.  And he says the rate of failure with people in AA is equal to the rate of failure to people  that just on their own decide they're going to stop drinking.  Like, it's very high, the rate of failure.  I would assume the rate is really high, but I don't know. 
[00:08:00]  I also see that it does good for a lot of people.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's whatever works for you.  You know, if that works, then fine.  But he doesn't want to, he doesn't want to be sober.  Well, he called Alex Jones.  Alex Jones has some kind of connection to him.  We've had Alex Jones on a few times.  Yeah.  I kind of want to get Alex Jones on this morning, but we usually wake him up and I think  he, it's, it's, I think he does a sleeping pill or something because last time he was  on, he was all over the place and then finally said, I'll get back to you. 
[00:08:30]  And then he hung up and we haven't heard from him since.  I think it's one of those Ambien things maybe.  I don't know for sure, but he was rambling to the point where, wow, this guy's not waking  up too quickly.  But when they put that disclaimer on the Ambien commercials where it's like, allow yourself  at least seven to eight, nine hours of good restful sleep before you get up.  I think he was up at about four hours.  Okay.  Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  Who, who enjoys the, the conspiracies.  Well, a Kwan-spiracy.  Yeah, we call them Kwan-spiracies. 
[00:09:00]  Where's Troy?  Troy knows something about Charlie.  Does he?  Well, there really is a friendship between Charlie Sheen and Alex Jones.  It sounded like there's a few years they've had some type of relationship going, but I'll  elaborate on that after we hear from Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  He's been on the show a couple times.  Yes.  Charlie Sheen has.  Yeah.  And Alex Jones.  He's a big conspiracy dude.  Oh, so Charlie Sheen's a big conspiracy.  He's a freedom fighter.  Yeah.  He's deep in the trenches with Alex Jones.  9-11's an inside job, the whole thing.  The whole thing.  He's all in?  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, great.  That makes perfect sense.  Well, me and Ant disagree with the Alex Jones right now because I was disappointed in Alex  Jones because he's buying into Charlie Sheen saying he's sober and everything during this  18-minute conversation.  But you think he was doing it just because he knew he had such a great scoop yesterday.  I've been in the old radio business for a while.  I know that in radio you're looking for that moment.  You are looking for that moment.  Here's a guy that's huge in Hollywood right now, Charlie Sheen. 
[00:10:00]  The story's huge.  It's on all these fucking rag magazines and rag shows.  And he gets them.  And now he's going to pump in for every bit of information.  As long as Charlie Sheen's talking on his show, he knows it's golden.  Now, whether they're friends or not, whatever kind of friendship they have outside of that,  because he's mentioned that he's been over Charlie Sheen's house.  They've worked out together.  They've sat and watched movies.  They've worked out together and stuff.  But it seems to me like if you were a really good friend, you would tell Charlie Sheen during 
[00:10:30]  that interview, hey, Charlie, we're going to take a break, put you on hold, and then  tell the guy, look, do you really think this is in your best interest to be doing this?  Right.  So I see it as, I might not go as far as to say using him, but there is a certain liberty  that he was taking with Charlie Sheen to forward his own name and advance his own radio show.  Maybe he was torn.  Maybe he is friends with Charlie, but he also knows fucking that.  We've been in that situation before where, you know, maybe not with something as high 
[00:11:00]  profile as Charlie Sheen and what's going on with this huge number one TV show and everything,  but where you are kind of like, should we continue with this?  Because I know this is going to like maybe fuck this guy's life up a little bit or something,  but it makes for such good radio.  You just plow through it and deal with it later.  Well, why don't we play the audio from Alex Jones' radio show?  Yeah.  This is just amazing.  And then Charlie Sheen came out with a statement yesterday.  Well, Alex Jones' voice, it's a little more raspy than a man cow, but you can almost hear 
[00:11:30]  him say turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  I'm going to have to get my turd clip.  Turd.  Turd.  Well, E-Rock put together a bunch of guys.  Speaking of turd.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  He put together a bunch of sandwiches.  Put together a bunch of sandwiches. 
[00:12:00]  That's fantastic.  I hit that by accident.  A little rolling laughing clip.  I got to remember where that is.  That's fucking great.  We're going to use that one.  Yeah, E-Rock put together something a while ago where it's all the radio guys that sound  alike.  Yeah, yeah.  There's about five or six of them.  They all have that voice.  High profile guys, too, and they all have a very similar voice.  The radio voice.  Very similar delivery and voice. 
[00:12:30]  Don't pop your P's and make your S's into SH's so it doesn't hiss on the microphone.  It's old school.  A little old.  Charlie talks about how awesome he is.  This is from yesterday.  And that was pretty much a thread through the entire interview.  Yes.  I'm tired.  I'm so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect and bitching and just winning every  second.  And I'm not perfect and bitching and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn 
[00:13:00]  because look what I'm dealing with, man.  I'm dealing with fools and trolls.  Fools and trolls that are shoveling money into your bank account.  Is he doing this speech from our brains?  Maybe some people will get it, but it also sounds like Scott Farrell when Scott Farrell used  to be off the rails, man.  Yeah.  Well, not the voice so much.  Not the voice so much.  Not as...  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  But the rhythm of it.  Hey!  And some of the phrases and words that Charlie's using is very Scott Farrell-ish.  He's not bitching all the time.  You know, dealing with soft targets and it's just, you know, it's just strafing runs in  my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these clowns.  He uses a lot of military analogies to kind of put himself out there and sell himself.  I got to go back. 
[00:14:00]  How do you go on a strafing run before you have your...  In your underwear.  In your underwear.  What could possibly be going on as you're waking up?  He's wiping people out.  Or in his case, he never went to bed, so I guess it makes sense.  Before the first cup of coffee, he's wiping people out.  He's strafing in his underwear.  Just strafing runs in my underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have  time for these clowns.  I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and, you know, they lay down  with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives  and then they look at me and they say, I can't process it. 
[00:14:30]  Well, no, and you never will.  Stop trying.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  Wow.  Come on.  Can we get that on a t-shirt?  With their ugly wives and ugly children.  I know it would be a little wordy on a t-shirt, but who doesn't want to walk around with that  on their chest?  And he's like, yeah, he's...  The only reason he's getting all this press is because he's partying like a motherfucker.  He's fucking prostitutes and fucking strippers and porn stars and his wife, apparently. 
[00:15:00]  It is just...  And most people, their lives are kind of sucky.  Drive in, drive out.  So you look at Charlie Sheen and how could he not deny that it looks like a great life  on the surface.  You can't process it.  Right.  So he's saying, if you criticize it, you just can't process this.  What is he supposed to do?  Get rid of the hookers, the party, the party that's around him constantly?  Who gives a fuck that he's not going to make it to that famous age of 74, 75, 76? 
[00:15:30]  He's living right now.  He might drop dead a lot sooner than he would have.  But you know what?  The guy's living the life.  And he doesn't sound like he's got any regrets right now.  No, none.  You know?  Wow.  I am speechless.  Later, we're going to get into Apocalypse Now.  But what comes to mind is when we were there a few weeks ago watching it in your home theater  when Colonel Kurtz is saying, you can kill me, but you can't... 
[00:16:00]  You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me.  Boom.  That's the whole movie.  That's life.  That's life.  There's nobility in that.  See, this is where I get confused with Alex Jones.  So he's at his house a couple weeks ago?  They're watching Apocalypse in his theater.  That was some primetime party for Charlie Sheen.  Yeah, yeah.  So Alex knows a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What was Charlie doing that day when you guys were hanging out watching Apocalypse Now?  If they're watching Apocalypse in the theater and they're getting deep into the quotes, 
[00:16:30]  Kurtz's quotes and shit like that, you don't do that without some type of fucking drugs or alcohol  or something to just really make it like, man, you know, what Kurtz was saying is, you know,  this is bogus.  You can judge me.  You can kill me, but you can't judge me.  Right, right, right.  Because if you judge me, that's just bogus, and then we'll be bogus too. 
[00:17:00]  Fucking Jeff Spicoli Sheen.  That's just the beginning.  Charlie talks about the two and a half men people.  You know, the guys that have filled his bank account.  Oh, with huge money.  With huge money.  Who created two and a half men?  Did they just kind of hire Charlie, or was this his project?  Does anyone know?  I don't think it was.  I think they hired him.  It was doing very well.  So he's got to be grateful to a point if that's the case.  No, I think he's just like, man.  Unless he created the whole thing, brought it to CBS.  It's like, my greatness is what makes this show great. 
[00:17:30]  Greatness, bitchin' greatness.  Greatness.  That's him.  It's obviously going to be, you know, if they ever bring it back, closer to three men at this point.  How old is that kid?  He's pretty funny at all.  It's not even two and a half men.  It's three men.  It's three grown men, right?  Three grown men.  I think the show is done.  Done, done.  You think that's it?  I think they can't just say the show's done.  You think they try to recast?  Well, they're going to probably sit there and maybe recast.  Darren Stevens or totally new character? 
[00:18:00]  Totally new character.  Yeah, you don't bring in a Dick York.  No.  You go new character.  You bring in some long-lost uncle or something because that kid who's now 30 needs like a parental figure in his life.  I say you just get Emilio Estevez, you throw him in there and say it's the other brother that they never talked about.  There you go.  Yeah.  That's what Hollywood does.  Of course.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Be creative.  Write something.  They want to sit it out, see if Charlie makes the miraculous comeback. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  As far as the parting goes.  Yeah.  If that doesn't happen, then they start thinking, well, can we keep this going for a year or two?  How do we do it?  With somebody else.  John Cryer is certainly not going to get the job done by himself, right?  No, I'm so surprised he's been on a hit show this long.  Yeah.  That guy has been just one of those.  He was toast when we met him.  Do you remember when we met him in the dumb museum?  And no one cared about him?  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And we're all thinking, holy shit, there's the pretty and pink guy.  What has he done lately?  Is he the pretty and pink guy? 
[00:19:00]  Isn't he?  Is that what he was in?  Yeah.  I couldn't even, yeah.  Wasn't he Ducky?  Yeah, yeah.  That's it.  You remember the museum?  It was the same museum that, uh...  Dice?  Uh...  At the car museum?  Yeah, the car museum where Biggie was shot.  Right.  We did a broadcast from that museum.  And John Cryer wasn't one of the people that we were all interviewing.  He was just in there?  He went there to hang out hoping someone was going to interview him.  I remember this like it was yesterday.  And I'm thinking, that's Ducky.  What is he up to lately?  What a comeback.  And then a few more years go by, obviously. 
[00:19:30]  And then finally he gets this fucking hit show.  And he's one of the biggest TV stars right now.  And he's...  But he was dead in the water.  And he's at the mercy of a lunatic.  Yes!  Holy shit.  I was like, you know, cut me some slack, motherfucker.  Yeah, but he banked his money, too.  He's fine.  Yeah.  He's fine.  But this is what Charlie has to say about the two and a half men people.  Ah.  But you're ready to go back to work right now.  Well, yeah, but Alex, I gotta tell you, and I'm tired of being told, like, 
[00:20:00]  oh, you can't talk about that, you can't talk about that.  Bull, S-H-I-T.  Let me just say this.  I said it's nothing, uh, uh, this side of deplorable that a certain Haim Levine,  yeah, that's Chuck's real name, uh, mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.  Check it, Alex.  I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind cannot process.  He's healing at a pace.  Okay, last night I checked Haim.  I've spent, I think, close to the last decade, I don't know, effortlessly and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. 
[00:20:30]  And the gratitude I get in this, get is, is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to write.  Clearly someone who believes he is above the law.  Well, you've been mornin', dude.  Bring it.  Bring it.  You've been mornin', dude.  Bring it.  See, there's this guy for up.  Bring it.  Ba-da-ba-da-ba.  He, uh, wow.  So he's saying, yeah, Haim.  Haim.  Your real name.  Oh, my God. 
[00:21:00]  He, he, Charlie Sheen is saying his greatness.  Turned the tin cans.  Made the show into gold.  Yeah.  Right, right, right, right.  And, uh, the gratitude, he gets no gratitude.  He healed at a rate that is, uh, inconceivable for anybody to notice.  Right.  Meaning he healed within a week.  Yeah, yeah, he's fine.  Maybe too.  He doesn't need rehab.  He don't need AA.  He doesn't need anything.  He just fucking, he healed.  He healed, all right.  Let's say hi to, uh, Chip in Ohio.  Chip.  What's that?  This is Martin Sheen.  You never judge a man's success by the size of his wallet. 
[00:21:30]  Hmm.  What happened?  I don't know.  I wish I had that men in black thing, though.  So, uh, Charlie continues on the Alex Jones radio show.  A guy we've had on the show.  You think we can get, uh, Alex?  He's going to be a...  Not right now.  He's basking in his spotlight. 
[00:22:00]  Well...  We don't want to share it.  Yeah, but that's what you do.  You, you, uh, do interviews.  So we want an interview with Alex Jones today.  Not on another radio show.  I want to ask him a few questions about this, uh, this appearance by Charlie Sheen.  I'd love to, but...  Uh, Charlie talks about his new gnarly tattoo.  Yeah.  What's your favorite part so far?  Uh, well, favorite part is to come.  It's that one you were talking about at the end of the day.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was my favorite, too.  You know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm an F-18, bro.  And I will, I will destroy you in the air.  He, he is just a weapon. 
[00:22:30]  Charlie Sheen's a weapon of mass destruction.  I really want to get a survey going.  How many people bought into...  Because most people have heard this audio by now.  Yeah.  How many people bought into the fact that he might be sober?  Look, I've done some, some Coke in my day.  Mm-hmm.  Back in the, uh, 80s when, uh, it was actually a law.  You had to do cocaine.  Pretty much.  Yes.  Uh, and...  If you wanted to get laid, you did Coke.  Yeah.  And I hung around with people that did Coke.  Right.  Uh, and I, I know what it's like.  This is Coke? 
[00:23:00]  This sounds like Coke.  This is, that, that talk, it just goes a mile a minute.  It doesn't really go anywhere.  That confidence it gives you?  The confidence, the fuck, yeah.  This is every, every, you just play this for somebody and go, this is exactly what Coke  is.  So what percentage of people have bought into the fact he's sober and he's really mad at  the world?  Is there less than zero?  Can you actually do that as a percent?  Wow, you're giving, you're giving people a lot of credit out there. 
[00:23:30]  There's no one thinking this guy's sober.  All right, good.  How?  Good.  You know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm an F-18, bro.  And I will, I will destroy you in the air and I will, I will, I will deploy my ordinance  to the ground.  Are you going to announce your new, uh, tattoo here on air?  Yeah, why not?  Because it's just pure, pure and complete gnarly-isms.  Um.  No, gnarly-isms.  Is he having a stroke?  Gnarly-isms.  The bertaceous gnarly-isms of a bertacean, bertacean gnarly-isms. 
[00:24:00]  It's pure gnarly-isms.  Ah, gnarly-isms.  And it's, he pluralized it.  Not isms, right, isms.  He pluralized it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's pure gnarly-isms.  It's pure gnarly-isms.  God, I love this.  Gnarly-isms.  Don't you wish we could get audio like this every week?  Oh.  Audio like this only comes out every, maybe once every two years, unfortunately.  It's gold, Jerry.  It's gold.  It's gold.  Everyone's going, he's so on code.  Um, yeah, I sat with two, uh, hey, coincidence, uh, F-18, the top gun, radical, fire, napalm 
[00:24:30]  dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the attack sequence, the chopper attack sequence  on the beachhead, to go surfing, because they wanted to, and those people were in their  way, um, and I, and I was getting a tattoo during the, the, the, the, the death from above.  And it was a, uh, it's the banner from the death card that, that Kilgore is throwing on 
[00:25:00]  his victims.  But there's also falling from it is the, uh, is the apple from the giving tree.  There's my life.  Deal with it.  Oh, wait.  Can't process it.  Losers winning.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Can't process it.  Losers winning.  Goodbye.  Where does this rate with the, uh, Mel Gibson audio?  Uh, it's a, it's a different area, a different category.  Like if, if there are award shows, cause we were some fucked up phone conversations, they'd 
[00:25:30]  be in different categories.  They wouldn't be competing against each other, but, uh, they both would take away, uh, the  statuette.  The Mel Gibson probably more shocking cause you didn't expect it from Mel, even though he,  he had hints that he was a lunatic.  And it was against leading up to a woman.  It was very, uh, nasty.  This is, but to hear finally, Charlie possibly, you got to say, possibly drugged up out of  his fucking skull.  Do you know how low you'd be on the totem pole of lawsuits with Charlie Sheen? 
[00:26:00]  If you actually just came out and said he was doing, he, this sounds like a guy that  is rip roaring fucking just spaced on, on, on something.  And, uh, Coke, it's got that cadence.  It's got that, the, the, the jaw, you can almost hear the tightening of the jaw.  The just, you can't throw enough words out about how great you are.  And he seems to like apocalypse now, huh?  Holy shit.  He's watching it with fucking Alex.  He's watching it with the pilots. 
[00:26:30]  He's watching it with the tattoo guy.  That's not how he described it.  He's rip roaring, top gun, fucking fighting, fighting, freedom, kill motherfuckers.  Whatever he said.  Amazing.  Right.  Not just pilots.  I just sit there in my theater by myself.  I got to invite some fucking fighter pilots and tattoo artists over and the fucking hookers  and prostitutes.  We need, we need, we need adjectives in our lives.  Yes.  We need some great adjectives. 
[00:27:00]  Porn stars.  You just don't say porn stars.  No.  Gnarly porn stars.  Gnarly isms of the rip roaring fucking death from above.  Bertatious.  Bertatious.  Bertatious porn stars.  Porn stars that you can't even fathom.  Your mind can't wrap itself around it.  So deal with it.  Loser.  Here.  Winner.  Yes.  Bye-bye.  I fucking, he is the greatest.  Also falling from it is the, uh, is the apple from the giving tree. 
[00:27:30]  There's my life.  Deal with it.  Oh wait, can't process it.  Losers.  Winning.  Bye-bye.  Can't process it.  That's now my new favorite quote from the whole piece.  He's so profound in his, his speaking and his, it just his life that no one could really  wrap.  It would be as if God himself presented himself to you.  You can't process that.  So now you gotta think acid. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, you gotta, yeah, you gotta think some type of hallucinogen.  Maybe mushrooms.  Shrooming up a little bit.  Mushrooms would give you that abstract thing.  Right, right.  But he's talking at a level that people can't understand.  He's on his own level there.  There's God.  Right below God, Charlie Sheen.  Imagine someone.  And then the rest of us way the fuck down here.  Dude, imagine somebody explaining to you in graphic detail the expanse of the universe  in a way that, that you, you should be able to understand. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  But you can't because you're, you're a mere human.  Yeah, I can't wrap my head around that.  You're not Charlie Sheen.  I can't wrap my head around that.  No.  I'm not Charlie Sheen.  Loser.  Deal with it.  I'm dealing with it.  Winner.  Bye.  He's a winner.  I'm a loser.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Charlie talks about Major League Three.  He's all over the place.  This is kind of embarrassing to go from two and a half men and now this might be Major League  Three.  This might be the only thing he has after two and a half men, you know, move on from Charlie. 
[00:29:00]  Back to the well.  Oh, look.  Working for the weekend is being played on the local news.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody.  The weekend.  Yeah.  Siemens answers America's.  A little tootly-doo for a Friday morning. 
[00:29:30]  I like it.  I just love how local news has decided to become Morning Zoo Radio.  To have rejoiners.  Yeah, it's really strange.  Charlie on Major League Three.  Moving on along here, Major League Three, your other two were giant.  Hitch, and I knew the answer.  This is where I was disappointed in Alex Jones.  Yeah.  Charlie was rocking.  I know.  And then he slowed him down with a Major League Three question.  What are you doing?  I want to hear more fucking... 
[00:30:00]  I want to hear more about the...  Righteous.  The pilots and the gnarly-isms.  Gnarly-isms and tats.  Why would you bring up Major League Three?  Yeah.  Certainly, I don't think that's in the works.  Oh, my God.  Moving on along here, Major League Three, your other two were giant.  That hits, and I knew the inside baseball of some of the planning for that.  You told me about it a while back, but now it looks like it's really starting to come  together.  Tell us about when we're going to be looking for Major League Three and who's going to be  in it. 
[00:30:30]  Major League Three?  I don't know.  I haven't read it.  I don't care.  It's being directed and written by a genius named David Ward who, oh, I don't know, won  the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting.  How old is this guy?  The Sting?  At 23?  23.  Can you look up this guy?  I remember watching The Sting when I fucking wasn't allowed to drive.  That was like 76, I think.  76?  Yeah.  Maybe even earlier.  73?  Wow.  So that's 27, 38 years ago, let's call it, right?  Yeah.  So this guy is now pushing 60, and he's going to be doing Major League Three. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, I don't know.  Won the Academy Award.  And I think Alex didn't have enough confidence in his audio yet.  Yeah.  And he was hoping to get a scoop.  Yeah, yeah.  Not realizing he already had the scoop.  You got the scoop, my friend.  Because he heard, like, inklings that there was a Major League Three being written.  So he's like, well, maybe this will get me on the TMZ sites.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  So hanging out in a room with him must be exhausting. 
[00:31:30]  Imagine hanging out in a room with Charlie Sheen.  Is there one moment of downtime where you can just sit and go, I just want to watch Apocalypse?  I haven't done drugs in 20 years.  And I think every once in a while what it would take to maybe do drugs again.  Hanging out with Charlie.  I've thought about maybe smoking pot again.  For real.  Yeah, yeah.  But, I mean, like, let's say Coke.  I think you would have to.  If Charlie Sheen came in and did an interview with us and then said, hey, man, I got a suite. 
[00:32:00]  You want to come back and hang out?  Sing and party?  You want to party a little bit?  Got a bunch of people coming over.  I think I would be doing Coke with Charlie Sheen.  We'll do lines of blow and I'll just tell you everything about Major League Three.  Right.  Oh, great.  I think that's a circumstance where I would probably do drugs again.  Charlie Sheen could just get anyone fucked up.  I would just throw it away.  You know Rich Voss is weak.  He would be right there.  Jimmy's such a fanboy.  Oh, Jimmy would be weak. 
[00:32:30]  He'd fall off that wagon in a second.  Yeah, Jimmy would be all in.  We'll have to ask Jimmy on Monday.  Because there's just, like, whores running around his place and drugs and shit.  Right.  And it's like, oh, God, I've got to do this with this guy.  How many opportunities are you going to get?  I think that's what it would take.  It's the guy from Platoon, motherfucker.  I think people do that in their own lives.  Think about it.  They're like, what would it take for me to really fucking lose my mind again?  Yeah.  Charlie Sheen inviting you to a party?  I think you're in trouble. 
[00:33:00]  The only thing that could kill Charlie Sheen is Charlie Sheen.  Oh, you know something about death?  Why don't you tell me about it?  Charlie's coming out with a YouTube video?  Oh, where he cooks a chicken, drinks wine, and plays video games.  That sounds familiar.  All right.  I might be in my house doing some kooky stuff, too. 
[00:33:30]  I didn't think you were drunk during your fine chicken video.  No, I actually hadn't had anything until I just drank my little glass of wine.  Actually, my Guinness.  Yeah, a little inside reference, but if you haven't seen it, go to our Facebook page.  It's linked, I'm sure, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yes.  The Facebook page.  You can see Anthony's chicken video.  It's pretty funny.  I cook a chicken in a bag.  Enjoy.  You sure do.  Are those delicious?  Fucking fantastic.  Because I go old school.  I fucking get a chicken.  I cut the stupid legs off. 
[00:34:00]  Who wants the legs when you want the breast meat?  Oh, no, really?  You like the legs?  Yeah, I like having them on there.  I like having the whole chicken in there.  No, I actually found a place where it's creepy because it's just a lump of chicken.  The body, the torso?  Yeah, it's just like a...  It looks like a serial killer's got into it.  Yeah, it's just like a square.  No hint that it actually was living because I don't like the legs and I get more breast meat.  Well, I get also the Purdue roaster breast.  It's just a fucking giant chicken breast. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, that's what that is, is they just cut all the legs off.  But there's no spine in it or anything either.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they just take the fucking breast.  Yeah, it's amazing.  How the fuck they do that?  I don't know.  It's amazing.  Like fucking Predator.  No, I need that.  They just lean over it and rip it out of his back and go...  It cooks better if the bones are in there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Maybe not in the bag.  And then I do what?  Hour and a half at 375, I think.  But now with this bag shit, what do you do?  Dude, I go for...  Because you didn't really explain it in the video. 
[00:35:00]  I watched the video because I really thought I was going to learn about chicken in a bag.  Cooking ain't much of this cooking video.  I was really mad.  I'm like, oh, good.  I get to see my pal and then I get to learn about the chicken in the bag.  Anyone that thinks I actually made a cooking video, you think Charlie Sheen  was fucking sober, too.  Not going to lie to you.  It was false advertising.  It was false advertising.  I'm a little bummed that I didn't learn about cooking a chicken in a bag.  There's a lot of other stuff going on in there.  Little cooking.  Very little cooking going on. 
[00:35:30]  But what?  You just throw it in the oven?  The spice is already in the oven?  Everything's in there.  It's all spiced and marinating and shit like that.  And then you throw it in the bag.  Purdue?  You cut a little slit in the top of the bag.  About an hour and a half.  Right.  You open that fucking thing up.  It is the most tender, juicy fucking chicken.  Wow.  I'm stunned.  Wow.  It is crazy.  What about the skin?  This was a skinless.  Really?  And it was still fucking amazing.  Skinless with all the spices?  With all the spices. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, fuck.  I gotta try this.  It was so fucking good.  It's like I'm doing a commercial for that goddamn Purdue.  Yeah.  But it was amazing.  You know what I realized for the first time?  By the way, you can get a full chicken in there, too.  Yeah.  I'm definitely gonna try.  Maybe this weekend.  Maybe it'll be my Oscar dinner.  I'll have one of these right before the Oscars.  Yeah.  You know when you eat like a dozen chicken wings?  Yeah.  That's six chickens?  Yeah.  You never realize.  Have you ever really done the math?  Because you don't really think about this shit. 
[00:36:30]  When I order chicken wings, I'm thinking, oh, this poor chicken.  No.  No, it's six chickens per dozen wings.  And a lot of times they're using the rest of the fucking chicken.  Right.  But still, you're like, holy shit.  It took six chickens to get me my delicious wings.  To fucking just perish.  So I could be sitting in there looking up at the TV, sucking the meat out of this fucking thing.  And I bet you at this point they raise chickens just for their fucking legs.  Yeah, just for the legs.  And the rest is ground up for like dog food or something. 
[00:37:00]  I would assume.  They give them special leg exercises.  They give them a leg press machine.  Yeah, they're not some tribe in the middle of nowhere where they use every piece of the chicken.  No.  You know us fucking Americans.  It's like, this one's bred specially just for legs.  Right.  Big burly, leggy chicken.  And who eats only a dozen chicken wings?  So, you know, safe to say two dozen is easy.  That's 12 chickens.  It's an amazing chicken holocaust going on.  Yeah, you don't want to think about it.  No.  Well, next time you're sitting around eating your wings at one of these wing places, bar 
[00:37:30]  slash wing places, just start doing the math in your head as they're hauling wings out  of the back.  Every two you eat, just go, one chicken.  One chicken.  Two chickens.  It's a fucking holocaust.  And then Frank Perdue's son is a sick fuck because he has these commercials where he treats  the chickens like they're pets.  Yeah, until, you know, he lops their heads off.  And he's the main fucking holocaust guy for the chickens.  Look at those baby chicks and chicken.  There's got to be so many chickens in this country. 
[00:38:00]  Do they have brains?  Oh, little pea brains.  They don't even know what's going on.  You don't think they know?  Not a clue.  I don't care because I like my chicken.  Chicken is the shit.  I'm not giving up chicken.  Dumb animals.  And you know what?  I had a dish yesterday made with turkey when it was supposed to be veal.  No, I want my veal.  Veal is so good.  It was one of those veal piccadas.  Yeah.  But it was turkey.  And I'm like, what's missing here?  Oh, yeah, the tasty veal. 
[00:38:30]  You want the pink veal.  Yeah, you do.  The white veal.  You could pound that shit with a hammer all day.  It ain't going to get tender.  It sucked my dick.  I love that scene.  Let's go back to the Charlie audio from the Alex Jones radio show.  Charlie talks about Major League 3.  Yeah, we were in the middle of that.  But Reddit, I don't care.  It's being directed and written by a genius named David Ward who, oh, I don't know, won  the Academy Award at 23 for writing The Sting.  And it was his pen and his vision that created the classic that we know today as Major League. 
[00:39:00]  In fact, a lot of people think the movie's called Wild Thing, as they should.  Because he was Wild Thing.  But whatever.  I agreed to do it.  There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson, a wonderful man, and Morgan Creek, a great company,  need to work out.  If they want me in it, it's a smash.  If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.  A tugboat.  A lot of people think it's called Wild Thing.  A bunch of people saying that it would be Major League 4? 
[00:39:30]  They've done 3?  I didn't know that.  Well, he was in Major League 1 and 2.  They came out with a third one, but it wasn't actually called Major League 3.  It was called Major League Back to the Minors.  But he wasn't in that one.  So technically, this would be the fourth Major League movie.  Not technically, Danny.  Not in Charlie's mind.  In Charlie's mind, they only made two, sir.  I don't know what's going on in Charlie's mind.  I don't think we can say technically.  Because we live in Charlie's world.  Whatever Charlie wants, Charlie gets.  You're speaking gnarly-isms. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  Because there's only been two with him in it, and that's all.  That's why Major League 3.  Yeah.  Even though the rest of the world would say no.  They kind of made that one already.  Are they doing Platoon 2 Back to Boot Camp?  I think everybody who wants to show support for Charlie Sheen during this trying time in his life  should get the Wild Thing haircut shaved into the background.  Ah, he is.  Wild Thing.  That way you could say, hey, I'm back in Sheen.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, here he comes out to the mound.  Wild Thing.  Whoa, look at what's in that rosin bag.  You make everything.  Yeah.  Wow, Thack.  Charlie Sheen is fucking off the hizzock.  Charlie talks about attacking people from the Alex Jones radio show yesterday.  Uh-huh.  This audio, obviously, everywhere today.  Yeah.  But, you know, there are parts of me that are Dennis Hopper because my motto now is you 
[00:41:00]  either love or you hate, and you must do so violently.  And the reason you must hate violently is because, and you have to hate everybody that's not in your  family because they're there to destroy your family.  And they will, and they will come at you in all forms and shapes.  And therefore, there's nothing in the middle.  I don't live in the middle anymore.  That's where you get slaughtered.  That's where you get embarrassed.  In front of the prom queen.  And I just, it's just not, it's just not an option.  So, you know, within that is, is it.  Have you ever been embarrassed in front of the prom queen? 
[00:41:30]  When I've been in the middle.  In the middle?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to be in the middle.  You've got to hate these people violently.  I wasn't lucky enough to even know the prom queen to be embarrassed in front of her.  Prom queen.  I don't know what he's talking about.  You don't?  You can't follow this?  I don't know what Charlie's talking about.  I can't wrap my mind around it.  I lose.  He wins.  Bye-bye.  And I just, it's just not, it's just not an option.  So, you know, within that is, is, is tremendous focus and tremendous clarity and tremendous  peace because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. 
[00:42:00]  If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.  And people say, oh, you know, you've got to work through your resentments.  Yeah, no, I'm going to hang on to them and they're going to fuel my attack.  And they're going to fuel the battle cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent  soldiers because they're all around you.  Anyway.  I thought you were just messing with one dude.  Sorry.  Winning.  He's crazy. 
[00:42:30]  I love this guy.  He's very sure of what he's saying.  Oh, God.  He's very sure of himself.  He's speaking like he's just, yeah, like he's, he's up in, giving a speech and everybody's  like, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Meanwhile, you're listening to this going, what the fuck is Charlie saying?  What is his family saying about this?  I think they initially came out with a statement that they hoped, you know, he would get help  and he's been struggling for years and blah, blah. 
[00:43:00]  Uh, but now they're just mum.  Mum's the word.  Like whatever.  Even Martin Sheen's just stopped.  Right.  You know, that's it.  Almost done here.  Uh, Charlie goes in on AA.  What does that mean?  Charlie.  Oh, he goes, uh, he starts.  Yeah, he goes.  Right, right, right, right, right.  You wanted to talk about AA because, you know, when I was at your house, I said, man, great  job being completely sober and, you know, uh, uh, how important it was.  But, but, but I can't use the word sober because that's a term from those people and, um, I'm 
[00:43:30]  just, I've, I've cleansed myself.  I closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Come on.  Come on.  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  You haven't in a nanosecond.  Nanosecond.  Wow.  And, and he can't use the word sober because it's not sober.  Right.  Uh.  I have cleansed myself.  I closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease 
[00:44:00]  and addiction and obsession.  It's just, it's just the work of sissies.  Um, the only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning, you know?  Uh, the, the, this, uh, this bootleg cult, uh, you know, arrogantly referred to as alcohol  exonimus, his, Alex supports a 5% success rate.  My success rate is 100%.  Do the math.  Do the math.  His, his success rate is 100%.  100%. 
[00:44:30]  In a nanosecond.  In a nanosecond he cures himself.  He is so awesome.  What, what, what is the success rate of AA?  I think it is around 5%.  Nah, I think it, it has to be higher than that.  I think it's pretty, I think it's pretty low.  I think it's pretty low.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Danny's looking it up.  Maybe we get it.  Like maybe the first time.  I'm going to guess it's closer to 10.  I'm going to go 10.  Really?  Yeah.  But then depending on what?  Rate of recovery is around 3 to 5%.  Wow, you nailed it, man.  Holy shit.  Really?  Yeah, it's, uh, that's a rough one. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  What about the people that stay, uh, sober for like 10 years?  That number's a lot higher.  And then they say, ah.  Maybe.  Survey after 12 years.  Wow.  I'm not sure.  Well, that fucking sucks.  That just, you know.  Yeah.  And Charlie Sheen ain't fucking falling for that.  I think it's tough because it's, uh, it's around you.  It's everywhere.  He's 100% though, dude.  He's 100%. 
[00:45:30]  He's 100%.  Well, he cures himself in a nanosecond.  Nanosecond.  Just closes his eyes.  He cleansed his whole fucking being.  And guess what?  He's cured.  He's cured.  Take, for instance, the founder of Death Ritten, I don't know, broken down plagiarist.  Stayed high on acid until the day he died.  And I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies.  And then, Alex, try to get your mind around this.  As a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches, their entire manifesto is built upon a complete  and total surrender, or the concept of complete and total surrender. 
[00:46:00]  They urge you to put down your sword and come join the winners.  In 22 years, the only winners I can locate in their toothless warren were either driving  a convertible van or living like trolls under some abandoned bridge.  Another one of those stupid mottos, Alex, is, uh, don't be special.  Be one of us.  Newsflash, I am special, and I will never be one of you.  There it is.  You sound like Thomas Jefferson.  Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson.  He was a pussy. 
[00:46:30]  That's the t-shirt.  Thomas Jefferson was a pussy.  That's the t-shirt.  That's it.  That we all need.  Thomas Jefferson was a pussy.  How do we start printing those immediately?  Throw a little O&A logo on it?  This guy is gold.  Said by Charlie Sheen.  Yes.  We're going to make a fortune off the Thomas Jefferson is a pussy t-shirts.  Coming soon from the O.P.  A pussy.  That statement right there is going to piss off a lot of fucking people.  Why?  The A.A. people are not going to forget that.  No, no.  The A.A. people are just going to, well, they're probably going to say he needs help. 
[00:47:00]  They're intense.  But I bet they say something like, he needs help, and we hope the best for him.  But they're going to take the high road.  Uh, not all of them.  Not all of them.  No.  Not some of the toothless trolls that live under the bridges.  No.  That's going to come back to haunt him.  That's my word on that one.  It really is.  He is awesome.  He is awesome.  I can't.  His gnarly-isms.  Yeah.  I don't have a problem with any of this.  No.  It makes for a great radio.  Here's a guy living his life.  I don't know the guy. 
[00:47:30]  Who cares?  Who cares?  And he, uh, he knows who he is, I guess.  I don't know.  You're having the bull by the balls.  Charlie is a winner.  One more clip here, and then we got a bonus clip that we weren't going to play, but then  me and Ed both decided it was our favorite clip.  Yes.  Yes.  Debate me on AA right now.  I have a disease.  Bullshit.  I cured it with my brain.  With my mind.  I'm cured.  I'm done.  Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.  Well, you know, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun. 
[00:48:00]  I'm going to hang out with these two smoking hotties and fly privately around the world.  You know, I might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex.  Come on.  Well, not everyone can hang out with banging bitches.  That's what he's talking about.  And flying in a private jet.  That's exactly what he's saying.  That's what makes it tougher to get sober.  But that's exactly what he's saying.  Because logically, that doesn't make sense to give all that up.  But he can do it because he's awesome.  Right.  So he's the one that could do that, cure himself in a nanosecond, winging with smoking babes 
[00:48:30]  Right.  All over the place, private jets.  Peace.  He's Superman.  We're designing our Thomas Jefferson as a pussy t-shirt.  Look at this.  Yeah, come on.  We're doing it right now.  On the fly.  Of course.  That is so fucking good.  Oh, the computer is always giving that.  They're calling it a radio rant.  I would love to know what the...  Well, let's see.  Al Pacino and Scarface.  Literally, like, you need the bad man to feel good about yourself.  That's the theme I think he was going with. 
[00:49:00]  Anyway, his boss, you know, the people he works for, CBS, they are shutting down his show for the rest of the season.  Two and a half men.  A big rally expected in New Jersey.  You know what, though?  If they shut that shit down...  You know what?  ...and then start it up again, it's going to...  The ratings will be huge.  Of course.  But he's crossed the line as far as they're concerned, not how we're concerned.  But the cha-ching factor...  I know.  The amount of money they're going to lose shutting down that show. 
[00:49:30]  But the amount of money they make with that...  When they come back, who isn't watching the premiere episode?  But how do they come back with him now?  They just put him back.  You think?  Again?  The guy...  I think he's gone too far in their eyes now.  But here's the deal.  The guy fucking...  But he was there to tape every show.  Right.  He apparently did a good job.  Yeah, you didn't really notice when you were...  No!  You noticed that he looked a little...  A little gaunt, perhaps.  A little gaunt at times, but... 
[00:50:00]  But it's...  Wait.  Well, the Alex Jones rant by Charlie Sheehan...  Wait.  The Alex Jones...  That doesn't make sense.  Charlie Sheehan on Alex Jones.  The whole rant ended with him talking about Jaws.  Yeah, talking about Jaws.  And this is my favorite part because I was listening to this a few times last night.  I really try to wrap my head around this minute of audio.  Right.  I really did.  I try to put myself in Charlie's position and I just didn't get it. 
[00:50:30]  I got it.  You did in a way?  Yeah, I knew what he was talking about.  Like, logistically, I knew what he was talking about.  I understood logistically, but...  But spiritually, I wasn't quite grabbing him.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was like, well, okay.  Yeah.  But he thought it was the greatest thing ever.  At the time, it probably was.  He probably had a girl sucking his dick.  All right, good point.  One sucking his tongue in his balls.  Good point.  And he's watching that going, this is great.  Of course it's great.  Doing lines off another girl's boobs. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right, you know what?  Listening to the fucking Indianapolis speech.  You're right.  It's the best time in the world.  Jaws.  Let's start talking about Jaws.  How great that was.  You thought to, a few days ago, go out on the Pacific Ocean in a big yacht while watching Jaws.  And you said the horizon matched the television perfectly.  It was incredible.  If you haven't done this, I urge you to make plans and do this tonight.  Meaning, go get yourself a yacht.  Get yourself a fucking pleasure crab.  Right.  Take it out into the ocean where you can't really see the horizon of the land. 
[00:51:30]  That'll ruin it.  Right.  Get a TV.  A big TV, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Mount it by the giant bank of windows in your huge boat.  It can't just be a little porthole.  Yeah, this is what Charlie's telling us all to do.  Yeah, you've got to mount it so it's there.  And then...  I don't know about you, but I've never been on a boat where I wasn't seasick.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's just too small to really deal with the waves out there.  And then make sure the giant flat screen TV, the horizon of the movie, lines up with the actual horizon of the sea behind you. 
[00:52:00]  And it's almost like playing Dark Side of the Moon and then fucking clicking on...  Wizard of Oz.  Wizard of Oz.  Well, do you've got to make sure that the time of day you're out there matches up with the movie, too?  It's probably got to match.  Like, just around sundown.  How do you do that?  Just around sundown.  And then you've got to have the right angle, right?  It's Charlie Sheen.  You've got to kind of move the boat around until...  Oh, yeah.  Until it lines...  Everything lines up.  But it's Charlie Sheen.  And do this tonight. 
[00:52:30]  What I wanted to do is I wanted to watch Jaws on the ocean in the dark and be afraid.  I wanted to embrace the fear and relive the movie.  What I didn't count on was it basically turned into Star Tours.  It turned into 4D because there were moments during the Indianapolis speech, which is about looking fear right down the barrel, which nobody understands anymore, where their horizon matched ours.  We were basically in the orca listening to the speech.  This is me not on drugs, bro. 
[00:53:00]  As I said, the first one's free.  The next one goes in your mouth.  So it was an incredible experience.  And I felt...  You know, I, of course, took full credit, but I had no idea that the fourth dimensional aspect of it would occur.  And it occurred in such a magical sense that we all just sat there in awe and with our jaws open.  See, you lost me.  See, he kind of lost me.  I get it logistically.  Right.  I get the setup.  I get mechanically how this works. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  But the thought that he was in awe and this fourth dimension, that I wasn't quite getting.  No.  No.  Oh, good job.  Pete in Jersey.  Charlie's the new Jan Michael Vincent.  Oh, wow.  Remember when Jan Michael Vincent started losing his mind?  When he lost his shit.  He had some good shit that came out.  Yep.  Yep.  So that audio made the rounds.  Congratulations to Alex Jones, a fellow broadcaster that certainly has been on our show a few times.  What a scoop.  It's a big scoop for him.  And within hours, CBS said, fuck that, we're shutting down two and a half men. 
[00:54:00]  They shut down production for the season, citing Charlie Sheen's conduct.  Yeah.  We finally had it.  So then Sheen goes, oh, really?  So he reacted by posting something to TMZ, saying, in part, I gracefully ignored series creator Chuck Lohr's folly for 177 shows.  I fire back once, and this contaminated little maggot can't handle my power.  I urge all my beautiful and loyal fans who embrace this show to walk with me side by side as we march up the steps of justice to right this unconscionable wrong. 
[00:54:30]  Okay, yeah, this unconscionable wrong.  What the fuck is he saying, walking side by side of the justice?  It was great.  I had a stripper.  She was treating my dick like the shark treated the Kittner boy.  Right.  It was the fourth dimension. 
[00:55:00]  But the straw that broke CBS collective back may have come with comments Sheen made to TMZ when the entertainment news site asked him to follow up on his radio interview.  I finally hate Chuck Lohr.  He's a stupid, stupid little man and a pussy punk that I never want to be like, Sheen said.  You could tell him one thing.  I own him.  Well.  There you go.  There you go.  Amazing.  Charlie fucking Sheen. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  That's what I'm calling him from now on.  Let's do a little good luck bro to Charlie Sheen today.  Good luck bro.  Good luck bro.  Good luck bro.  And Danny almost is done with the Thomas Jefferson is a pussy fucking t-shirt.  Yeah.  We're going to go with the nice portrait, huh?  Portrait, the famous portrait of Thomas Jefferson.  Nice.  That I think you find on a nickel.  Yeah, I like it.  And a $2 bill.  I believe he's on that one.  I thought we had the greatest audio yesterday, but man, were we trumped by Alex Jones. 
[00:56:00]  Oh my God.  Weren't we?  Come on.  We were fucking trumped by Alex Jones.  It happens.  To Louis C.K.  Are you a lizard?  Donald Rumsfeld.  Donald Rumsfeld.  Take it off.  Call Rummy a lizard.  We posted a video.  Is that on Facebook too?  The link?  To Louis C.K.'s...  Oh, it is up there?  All right.  You go to Opie and Anthony on Facebook, you can see about 17 minutes of our interview  with Donald Rumsfeld, including, of course, Louis C.K.  asking him if he was a lizard. 
[00:56:30]  Someone's suggesting here also that I'm an F-18, bro, is a great shirt.  I'm an F-18, bro.  Very rudimentary.  We might have to come out with a couple of them.  It's very rudimentary.  Yeah.  I'm going to Photoshop on this machine.  Yeah, yeah.  Rudimentary.  Rudimentary.  That's good, though.  I'll come up with something better later.  I like the Thomas Jefferson was a pussy t-shirt.  Yep.  I'm an F-18 is a good one, too.  I'm an F-18, bro.  I'm an F-18, bro.  So then we've got to get, like, graphics and stuff. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Make it all look all fucking badass.  Some swooshing fighter plane.  Nice.  Magically converting your tin can into pure gold.  I just want to see how the news handles this.  The gratitude I get in this kit is this charlatan chose not to do his job, which is to write.  Clearly someone who believes he is above the law.  Well, you've been warned, dude.  Bring it.  Now, there's one theory that Sheen actually wanted out of that show.  And it kind of may make sense.  This is a letter he sent to TMZ reacting to the decision to cancel filming.  This is, you kind of mentioned this earlier, Greg. 
[00:57:30]  Quote, I fire back once, and this contaminated little maggot can't handle my power and can't handle the truth.  I wish him nothing but pain in his silly travels, especially if they wind up in my octagon.  Clearly I have defeated this earthworm with my words.  Unquote.  Now, it's unclear when or if the show is going to begin filming again next year.  Rosanna, back to you.  All right.  Thanks so much, Ty.  Well, the woman charged with...  That's hysterical.  That show's not coming back. 
[00:58:00]  That's not coming back.  No.  He's calling him an earthworm.  He made a lot of money off that show.  Holy crap.  He...  A lot of money.  He F-18'd that bridge right there.  Yeah, exactly.  He didn't burn it.  He fucking carpet-bombed it.  He took it out with his F-18, bro.  His F-18.  Bridge gone.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's the big story today.  That's great.  We got Patrice coming back today.  Patrice O'Neal.  Yes.  Becoming a fan favorite.  Love Patrice.  He'll be in.  And Pat Cooper today. 
[00:58:30]  Wow.  Pat Cooper!  So between Patrice O'Neal and Pat Cooper, I guess we don't have to talk the second half of the show today.  We can save our voices.  Just sit back and watch.  Thank God.  Pat Cooper is a bit wordy at times.  Oh, boy.  We figured that would be a good mix today.  Patrice O'Neal and Pat Cooper.  Yeah.  We're going to torture you.  Is that what we're telling the people?  Yes.  All right.  We'll take our first break.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  On the virus. 
[00:59:00]  Sirius XM.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Everybody wants a new romance.  Hey, yeah.  Everybody's going off the deep end.  Everybody needs a second chance.  Oh.  Yeah.  We're working for the winger.  Yeah.  You better stop the stage. 
[00:59:30]  This guy got fat.  Mike Reno.  You see Mike Reno?  Good old Mike Reno.  One of those Whatever Happened To shows.  And Jesus Christ.  He is quite a chub.  What are you going to do?  Happens to all of us.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  Work out.  Maybe eat better.  What are you going to do?  That becomes a problem after a while, too.  I know.  Believe me.  But we all can't live like Charlie Sheen.  Unfortunately.  We've got real responsibilities out there. 
[01:00:00]  Cocaine diet.  Great.  Cocaine.  Gaddafi, what do you think?  Because we're going to have a replay today.  Yeah.  Now, here's the deal.  We blew it with Egypt.  When we were talking about Egypt, and it was the last day of Mubarak, we were talking about it,  and we didn't know it was going to happen.  So we do our little morning show, and then history happens, and Mubarak leaves.  Right.  And then we have the replay later in the afternoon with our dumb speculation that was completely wrong. 
[01:00:30]  We looked like assholes.  And we looked like a couple of assholes, man.  We said, he ain't going anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  He's going to make it until September at least.  This is just going to end in bloodshed, and there's going to be bodies in the streets.  Right.  It's like, we should have said, no, here's what's going to happen.  He's going to leave, and then a white reporter's going to get gangbanged.  And that's it.  Bye-bye.  I don't mean to laugh at that.  It's horrible.  Yeah, whatever.  It happened.  Someone did tweet me and said, don't they learn? 
[01:01:00]  And they showed me a picture of another blonde reporter in the middle of the chaos.  I'm not sure where.  I'm not sure if it was a Libya thing.  Maybe she wanted it.  But it's like, what are you doing?  Stay away from the blondes for a while.  I've noticed on the news, they say, and let's go to blah-de-blah, one of the reporters, who's  keeping an eye on the story from a safe distance.  And they make a point of saying that, like, we're responsible. 
[01:01:30]  We're responsible.  Don't worry about us.  Would the safe distance be, I don't know, Indianapolis?  Yeah, that's a safe distance.  That's a safe distance.  How about, yeah, from looking at a monitor of a fucking Predator drone from Vegas or something.  From the space shuttle.  Yeah.  That's a safe distance.  Yeah, it looks, here's what it looks like.  It looks like Gaddafi's in some big trouble.  He's in a jam here.  From the latest news I got, as of, you know.  Let's call it.  So we look like fucking rock stars later on in the replay. 
[01:02:00]  Here's what's going to happen.  Gaddafi is going to be overthrown.  Today.  Today.  It's going to happen.  Today.  What time is it, though?  I think it's tonight, over there.  Is it today or this morning?  I don't know, because now people are hearing this in the replay.  So what time is it now?  Hey, I'm an F-18, bro.  What time is it?  It's what?  Two in the afternoon?  No, it can't be two in the afternoon.  Two in the morning?  What time this replay is going to air? 
[01:02:30]  No, in Tripoli.  What time is it right now?  Oh, it's the afternoon.  Wait, this is prime time?  Let's take him out?  It's like the afternoon.  2.20, 2.30.  Okay, I'm going to go on record as saying he's already gone.  Yeah, he's gone.  He's been shot.  He's dead.  Can we get in trouble for saying Gaddafi's been killed?  Will we get fired?  Who knows?  They dragged his dead body out.  It's over.  Out the streets.  Blood.  I took care of that.  Beheading.  It was amazing.  You going beheading?  Yeah, I'm going to go hanging.  I'm going hanging in the little town square thing there that they got. 
[01:03:00]  Nah, not creative enough.  Really?  I mean, that's too creative.  No, but then they beat the shit out of him.  It's just going to be a bullet to the head, and then they just drag his life's body through  the streets.  Through the streets?  Yeah.  All clapping.  And that's some weird language that basically says, Gaddafi is dead.  Yeah.  Long live Libby or something.  And then they'll do a whole retrospective on his life and career as colonel.  Did you know that Beyonce performed for him?  Did he see that video going around yesterday?  Say what? 
[01:03:30]  I guess he threw some parties.  Maybe not for him personally, but for the family and stuff.  Yeah.  Those guys will throw money around, and then you get a private concert with someone like  Beyonce.  The Gaddafi party?  It was like a million dollars, and Beyonce's like, yeah, I'll go.  I think it might have been in the Caribbean, that one.  All of a sudden, she's just performing for the Gaddafis.  I don't know if the main one was there.  Probably not.  No?  No, I wouldn't think he'd show up.  You think Gaddafi would give Charlie Sheen a run for his money?  As far as drugs go? 
[01:04:00]  Well, the rumor is he's always on drugs.  I'm actually saying he's on drugs.  He's on drugs?  Guaranteed.  I'm guaranteeing it, because what's he going to do?  He's not on anything right now, because he's dead, and they're dragging his body through  the streets.  Dragging his body through the streets.  Yes.  Long live Libya.  Yes, yes.  Now, get another boss in there.  What kind of drugs are they doing in Libya?  I think it's an oil extract.  No.  They smoke it like hashish oil, like hash oil, under a glass.  I wouldn't be surprised. 
[01:04:30]  I don't even know.  They just take raw, light, sweet crude, and ball it up, and then they put it on a pin  through a book, right?  And they put a glass over it, and burn it, and then they go, blow it out, and cover it  with the glass, right?  Yeah.  The glass fills up with smoke.  They slide it to the edge of the book, and then go, lift up that lid.  And just inhale all the smoke from it under the glass, and then you feel it expand in  your lungs, and then you go, slowly you go, and you are so fucked up.  Sweet crude oil? 
[01:05:00]  What?  Sweet crude oil, though?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what it is.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't even know what the drug of choice would be in Libya.  Probably some kind of poppy thing.  Some kind of hash?  In that Middle East, they love their fucking hoppy heroin.  Is Afghanistan close enough?  Black tar heroin?  Is it?  Yeah, I think it's close enough to fucking, and their borders are just like, bring it  in, who cares?  You know what I love about revolutions?  You get to figure out where the countries are.  Yeah.  I didn't know Egypt was next to Libya. 
[01:05:30]  There was no reason for me to know that.  It's the only way you really learn.  You will look at the news and go, is that where that is?  And I think I also learned that it's part of Africa.  It's northern Africa.  I always thought it was its own thing.  I was looking at that.  Air pollution?  Yep.  Is the main cause?  What about cigarette smoking?  Main cause of what?  A heart attack.  Air causes heart attacks?  Hey!  No.  Yeah, air pollution, it said.  Causes heart attacks? 
[01:06:00]  Well, they said that 7.4% or something of heart attacks are caused by air pollution.  Nah, I think cause you just saw a graphic, you're like filling in the blanks.  How is that possible?  Maybe.  I got a mic in front of me though.  Oh, so it has to be real?  Yeah, it's true.  Alright, alright.  Oh, no, we don't want to predict that he was killed in a car accident, asshole.  No.  Kevin in South Carolina.  He was in Florida.  He had a young boy in the car.  Do you think we'd actually get in any trouble for lying that Gaddafi was killed in a car crash? 
[01:06:30]  I don't know.  Maybe the family's listening.  Uh, very upset.  Yeah, he's at his state-run TV station, which is in flames.  Right.  And he's complaining that we should be fired.  Hey, what's that part?  You see Africa there?  And then that thing, like, to the right?  It sticks out?  That's Somalia.  No, way up top.  Oh.  That?  No, the big piece.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, Saudi Arabia.  That's where that is?  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, see?  You kind of learn about Africa.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, that's where it is now.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  They moved it?  No, it's been there for a while.  Well, you said that's where it is now.  Well, if you want to...  Well, technically, the plates are moving.  I mean, it's not going to be there forever.  So it's moved a little bit, right?  What did they call it before?  Panjaya.  Oh, I thought that was a place from fucking, uh, from, uh, that, that...  That movie.  Panjaya.  Did you ever realize that Ethiopia is so high up? 
[01:07:30]  From Avatar.  I didn't watch Avatar.  I hated it.  No, look.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why what?  See, look.  Panjaya.  Panjaya.  Shows you all the continents together.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, I remember the Panjaya.  We learned that in school.  What was the name of the place then?  In what?  Avatar.  I didn't see that shit movie.  Oh, I saw it.  Um.  Pan...  Pandora.  Pandora.  Yeah, Pandora.  Oh.  It wasn't Tatooine.  You still haven't seen the Avatar? 
[01:08:00]  I keep seeing the beginning of it and pieces of it, and I'm like, I can't make it to the  end.  That movie will never hold up.  I have it, but, like, every...  I don't know.  It looks cheesy.  I don't know.  It does.  It was good, because it was the first, like, 3D movie that really did some cool 3D shit.  I saw Honey, I Shrunk the Audience at Disney, and let me tell you something, that was  the first 3D movie, and it makes you feel like mice are at your feet.  Yeah, it's not gonna...  Avatar doesn't hold up past...  Yeah, kids start crying.  It's great.  I'm a Captain EO boy for a long, long time.  Captain EO!  Captain EO was the first 3D movie! 
[01:08:30]  Horribly done.  Michael Jackson reached out and diddled...  He diddled the children in 3D.  Yeah?  Right in their own seats.  They'd sit there, and you know how Honey, I Shrunk the Audience?  They got these little things that come out and whip at your ankles from the seats  to make it look like rats and mice are at your feet?  Because they spill off the stage in 3D?  You're partying with Charlie Sheen?  Yeah.  They actually do that?  It's awesome, yeah, yeah.  It seems to be a major fucking pain in the ass.  Fourth dimension, man.  Fourth dimension. 
[01:09:00]  But they just got some fucking...  What?  Is it people?  No, no, it's like weed whackers that are on the legs of your chair, and they spin around  a little, and they kind of hit the back of your fucking socks and legs and shit.  Oh, I didn't know that.  And you just hear people go, what?  And it goes from one side of the audience to the other.  It's kind of fucking cool.  But Captain EO, they're doing the same thing, but every kid's seat has a big dildo thing  that pops up through the seat and actually penetrates their little bungs.  And as Captain EO, Michael Jackson, is singing, the kids are being actually molested in their 
[01:09:30]  seats.  That's the fourth dimension.  That's the fourth dimension, man.  Charlie.  Fourth dimension, man.  If you want to talk fourth dimension, that's the fourth dimension right there.  And with the 3D glasses, you get a shot of Jesus juice.  Yeah?  As a kid.  You do that sound, you get a little buzz.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Avatar was...  It's not going to hold up past the technology.  No, no.  All that shit.  It still will be looked at as a good movie, but...  You know what is amazing for 1993, and we've talked about it so many times? 
[01:10:00]  Fucking Jurassic Park.  Yeah.  It's like 93, and the fucking CGI is like, that's a goddamn dinosaur.  Pretty damn good, right?  It's not...  You look at it now and go like, alright, they could do a little better with the fucking,  you know, light blending on the things and textures and shit like that.  Did you say 93?  Yeah, I think 93 that movie came out.  Holy shit.  But still, that fucking T-Rex, when it's chasing the Jeep, that is a great scene.  And it holds up.  Sure does.  It fucking holds up, CGI.  Look at that fucking thing.  Why don't they... 
[01:10:30]  That sound, it was great.  Why don't they...  You think they would re-release Jurassic Park?  Remake it?  Not remake it, just like...  Oh, re-release?  Clean it up?  Clean it up a bit?  It's spilled...  Yeah, well...  Could you imagine?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No?  I don't know.  I'd say leave it alone, because he'll probably do something like, you know, oh, a parent wouldn't  do that.  Yeah.  Let me take that away.  Yeah.  Let's take the guns away and give the fucking Australian Velociraptor fucking guard guy  a walkie-talkie, and he just talks it out with the Velociraptor. 
[01:11:00]  He goes, smart girl.  And then he goes, yes, I am.  And then they go out on a date, and everything's hunky-dory.  Pussy.  Yeah, that took me out of the re-release of E.T.  Clever girl.  Clever girl.  They didn't even look right in their hands, the walkie-talkies.  The walkie-talkie.  Why would everyone have a walkie-talkie?  Because they wouldn't be shooting at a young child that's flying past the moon with an  alien?  Then don't remake the damn thing, or re-release it. 
[01:11:30]  What do you think you are, an F-18 bro?  I'm an F-18 bro.  You're fucking...  That's Spielberg you're talking about.  Winner.  You're gonna shit on him?  Bye-bye.  Yeah.  Well, I'm a winner.  Spielberg, loser.  Bye-bye.  Wrap your mind around that.  Bye.  I'm just gonna beat Charlie Sheen all day.  I'm gonna leave this fucking studio later.  What else is new?  Your Charlie Sheen weekend...  Touche, Danny.  You're touche. 
[01:12:00]  Your Charlie Sheen weekend starts in two and a half hours, sir.  Fucking watching Apocalypse in a theater, getting fucked up all the time with broads everywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's crazy, right, Ant?  Now that you put it in that context, that is a little fucked up.  You're Charlie Sheen light.  Yes, Charlie Sheen light, without the cocaine.  Right.  But you got all the other elements.  I do like the...  You got the movie theater, you got the Apocalypse now, and you got the girls.  Travis says that you're East Coast Charlie Sheen.  East Coast Charlie Sheen.  East Coast Charlie.  I, uh, yeah, I do, uh, like the fuel, the, the, the alcohol-fueled, uh, binge, the theater, 
[01:12:30]  the bar, fucking girls thing.  Yeah, this could be...  Wow, I never even thought of that.  Boy, there but for the grace of God go I.  I just don't have the Charlie Sheen fucking two and a half men mind.  Charlie's doppelganger.  Yeah.  You're doppelganger.  It never crossed your mind.  Yeah.  It never crossed your mind.  Yeah.  No, it didn't.  All right. 
[01:13:00]  We're like, uh, well, if E-Rock was still here, our show would be two and a half ton  man.  Yeah, E-Rock just left.  Because he's fat.  E-Rock's been puking all morning.  Oh, please.  We don't need you that bad.  Stay home.  I don't want to get sick.  He's probably eating too much.  Best thing that could happen to him.  Right.  Get it out.  Stop digesting.  Something went around this week.  Stomach saying no more could come in here.  Could you please stop?  You're full.  Did you have shitties yesterday?  I did.  Shitties?  No.  Oh, and horrendous.  It was nice, tapered.  Horrendous gas. 
[01:13:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Oil refinery gas.  Oh, God.  When it smells like a refinery.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's bad.  That's all methane.  My girl was yelling at me.  Was it the slow, long purge of heat?  I don't even know what I ate.  It feels like someone turned the thermostat up in the back of your pants?  It was horrible.  Just pure heat?  Yeah.  Or was it the quick, sound one?  No.  It was the long ones that just go.  And it's an actual temperature difference. 
[01:14:00]  You feel it.  Yeah.  Have you ever, like, you blast one of those off as you're sitting, and you get up like five  minutes later and smell it?  Oh, yeah.  And a bubble of it comes out from under your sack or something?  It's like, where was that hiding?  You know, a mistake that I've made a couple of times now, like more than one time, is I'll  fucking blast one, like, as I'm getting ready to leave or whatever, and then I bend  down to tie my shoe, and I basically just headbutt my own fart. 
[01:14:30]  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  And then every time I go, why did I do that?  Why would I do that?  Why did I do that?  I blasted, I blasted, you know, a few in the couch cushion and stuff, where you're just  sitting there, and then you get up like five minutes later, and it was, it was waiting.  It wasn't going to let you get away.  It was waiting for you.  That's funny, man.  Sometimes I like, I like when you have gas for like the whole day, and then you go home  and you change into something else.  But you go in, you just got to grab the ass of your jeans just to see.  Because you go, look, I know what I was doing all day. 
[01:15:00]  There has to be something in there.  It's like, fuck Breeze.  It just fucking, it permeates the material.  It just lives in there until you wash it.  It is fucked up, man.  That happens.  What are you going to do?  I know, it's just fucking human nature.  I don't understand why girls never get that, though.  Like, girls will admit they fart, but they don't get that over the top where it doesn't  matter where you are, you just got to release because you got the fucking gas pain. 
[01:15:30]  And refinery smell.  And it's just over and over again because you got something that's radioactive in you  that just keeps fucking emitting this horrible gas.  Laszlo said something once that always kind of stuck with me.  He was talking about farting.  When you smell someone else's fart, you just basically have the inside of that person's  ass in your nose now.  And you start overthinking it and you start thinking like, wow, yeah, like little fart  particles and molecules are now in me, like in my brain.  Yeah, because the receptors in your nose have to pick up, on a molecular level, pieces 
[01:16:00]  of shit, like molecular shit that was blasted out.  And they're coming in contact with your nose.  I just can't let that go sometimes where it's just like, that's so fucking this guy.  And then like people are using Purell and it's like, really?  Really?  But you smell someone's fart and you go, oh, that's okay.  You got a piece of someone's ass.  You're sniffing shit.  You're sniffing shit. 
[01:16:30]  Here's an experiment that I don't know if it's been tried or anything, but I've long  been curious about this one as far as farts are concerned.  Let's say you're in a room with somebody, right?  Okay.  You have gas.  The other person has gas.  Your farts, no smell at all.  The other person's farts, really bad.  But you're both silent at the same time, neither one knowing the other one farted.  I already know the answer.  Now, when you smell the other guy's fart, do you think it's yours and enjoy it? 
[01:17:00]  Never.  Now, why?  Because something happens to farts when they mix.  Like, you could like yours.  I could like mine.  You can like yours.  But if they mix, we're both of them.  No, no, no.  He's saying mine doesn't smell at all.  It's one of those days where there's no fragrance.  So now you're thinking the other guy's fart is yours.  Never.  No, I don't think.  Not a chance.  No, I think you would know.  So you don't fart.  You don't fart.  It doesn't fart, then.  No, no, no, no.  I do.  I know my farts.  I'm prying.  How do you know them? 
[01:17:30]  Because there are some standards out there.  There are some templates.  They're like, you could customize your fart, bring it into Photoshop and customize it.  But there are some templates that come with the program.  I don't know what it is, man.  I know my farts.  Really?  You don't need After Effects.  No, After Effects, yes.  My After Effects farts.  Even if it's a foreign-smelling one, I'm like, yeah, but that's mine.  I just know.  How do you know?  I don't know.  How do you know?  All right.  I'll do a lot count. 
[01:18:00]  How do you know?  Is this a Dr. Steve or a Michu Kaku question?  I don't know.  No, this is more a mental, this is kind of vague, this is kind of psychological.  There's a psychological thing.  Because it's not your nose now that's just smelling and knowing it's someone else's.  Your mind would absolutely think that that is yours.  Nope.  It's an evolution thing.  You just know.  It's like how birds know what birds belong to them.  Birds are retarded.  They don't know one bird from another.  But they just know.  They know their family.  Knowing it's baby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How does a bird know your fart? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  How does a bird know how to just fly to Florida?  Instinct.  Okay.  So you have instinct.  Instinct.  Yeah, you just know yours.  Instinct.  You know yours from somewhere else.  And you could smell yours and they could be the most horrific things ever.  It doesn't bother you.  But as soon as someone else farts, you're like, oh my God.  But I don't know.  You might think it's yours.  And is there any way to prove this?  Because you would know if you were.  It would have to be an experiment.  God, you couldn't get the.  It's synchronized.  And if you told the people what the experiment was, then they'd know.  You just know your farts. 
[01:19:00]  You know when you go in the bathroom and you smell someone else's.  You're like, oh my God.  Because you know it's someone else's.  That's what I'm saying mentally.  No, I understand what you're saying.  But nah.  Oh.  You don't fart.  You're not in the fart game, man.  I'm not in the game.  No, I'm a rookie.  You hold back too much.  Because what this is like now, this is like, I remember once I picked up a drink and I  thought that there was like soda in the cup or whatever, but it was iced tea.  Right.  I've done that, yeah.  So I picked it up.  I started to drink it.  And I realized once it hit my mouth, I was like, this isn't soda.  It freaks you out.  And I was immediately disgusted and spit it out. 
[01:19:30]  And then I realized, oh, it's just iced tea.  But my brain was so thinking that it was soda, it actually disgusted me that it wasn't.  So I think that's what you're getting at, right?  Because when you know, or when you think that it's something, you're more receptive to it.  And you know what I'm saying?  But then you'll think it's yours.  No, because your inner plumbing also has something to do with the farts.  Really?  Yeah.  The air is like pushing up against the walls and pushing other stuff out that you just  know is yours. 
[01:20:00]  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  Because you could smell someone else's fart and go, that is so fucking foreign.  And he probably had the same type of food that you had that day or whatever.  But it could just be because your mind knows it's someone else's.  But there's something in your body as well that is mixing in with the farts.  But if you smell a really bad one, you might think to yourself sometimes, I wish that was  mine, because I would enjoy that.  Oh, no.  You're out of your mind.  It's terrible.  You're not in the fart game.  I'm not in the game.  I've never.  I've been doing radio with you off and on. 
[01:20:30]  I've blasted a few, but I try to hold back.  We've been doing this since 70.  Hello.  I just consider it rude.  Since 1970s.  I've never heard you fart.  And there's times in the studio I can't help it, because, you know, I've got the gas.  Well, you've got to.  You've got the gas bubble.  And you've got to push out.  I don't know.  That's just one of the mysteries of life that, I don't know, I can't wrap my mind around.  Maybe Charlie Sheen knows.  Charlie Sheen would know.  I bet Charlie Sheen would know, because he's fucking awesome.  And he could wrap his mind around. 
[01:21:00]  He'd try to explain it to me, and I wouldn't even be able to fucking do it.  Boom.  I lose.  He wins.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  So Gaddafi is what?  What's the real news?  He's cornered as of 740 Friday morning on the East Coast.  A lot of these suburban areas, I guess you'd call them, the desolate areas, are already out of his control.  Done.  Done.  He's holed up in Tripoli.  That's pretty much the only place he still controls, but even that's fallen apart, because it's only mercenaries and some militia that are protecting him now. 
[01:21:30]  I think the entire military has turned on him.  Just about?  Yeah, just about.  And the protesters aren't stopping, even though they're being mowed down.  And I don't think he's got much time left.  Yeah, I think this one ends with his death.  Yeah.  The other guy.  We haven't even heard about the other guy since he left.  Where is he?  He might leave, though.  Mubarak?  Yeah, where is Mubarak?  I heard he was at that resort in Egypt. 
[01:22:00]  In Egypt?  Egypt, and he was in a coma.  A coma?  Why?  Yeah, because he lost the will to live and stopped taking his meds.  Really?  Yeah, that's what I heard.  He was on meds?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Something like that.  They actually canceled the rest of his show for this year.  He was doing so many drugs.  The Mubarak and half a fucking body.  But Gaddafi, this is going to be ugly.  Yeah.  I think it's just a bullet to the head.  They don't have time, and then they've got to get the body out in the streets for everybody. 
[01:22:30]  We didn't learn last time making these predictions.  I know.  At least we're acknowledging how uncomfortable it was last time.  When you hear this later, you'll be like, wait a minute.  I just saw the news, and Gaddafi is in exile.  He left.  He's been accepted in some shithole country.  I was wrong, too, because I said that I thought we should have cut that from the replay, because  it was so wrong and so off, and in a way, very old news by the replay.  Yeah.  But a lot of the listeners, they made their points.  They said, no, man, we'd just like to hear the show, how it was done. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  No matter what.  Yeah.  And it was just a bit of...  And then it gives you a chance to just openly laugh at us.  History.  It's what happened.  Bunch of dopes thinking they know world politics.  Yeah, yeah.  So I was wrong on that one.  I guess it's entertaining no matter what.  Yeah.  So Gaddafi's gone, and then what's going to be the next country that goes?  Saudi Arabia.  The people are too well off.  They make way more money than the Egypts and the Libyans.  Yeah, and I think even they know, like, if Saudi Arabia went, wow, that's a biggie. 
[01:23:30]  They actually stepped in yesterday and kept the oil prices down a little bit toward the  end of trading.  They said, hey, we can cover anything that Libya was pumping out, so no need to worry.  And they got a fuckload of oil.  So the oil prices went down a couple of bucks at the end of trading yesterday.  But if Saudi starts looking shaky, that is the key right there to the Middle East.  We're going to be paying over $4 a gallon. 
[01:24:00]  Already are.  We are?  Where?  Manhattan.  Manhattan?  Yeah.  There's a place in New York City where they did a story this morning, and they were talking  to the guy, and the reporter was even going, whether or not this has anything to do with  Libya, we don't know, but we talked to Mohammed as he was actually changing the numbers.  And it's like, all he was doing is, you know, not my fault.  I wish, for me, I wish it was, you know, for free.  For free.  But it was... 
[01:24:30]  Right.  Stop it, you lying sack.  They watch the news and just go, oh, people are afraid.  Let's hang up some higher numbers.  Right.  I want to prove to you that I know what I'm talking about with my farts.  We got a microbiologist on the line.  Microbiologist.  Mike in Jersey.  Microbiologist.  Asshole.  What's up?  Hey, Mikey.  Yes, well, Joe, Opie, you're kind of right.  You said everybody with their internal plumbing is kind of their own thing, and they make their 
[01:25:00]  own smell.  It's kind of true.  We all have what's called intestinal flora.  It's a whole mix of different bacteria living inside.  It's pretty much living inside of our gut, and it's those bacteria that make all the  gas that smells really bad.  Now, everybody's bacteria is different.  It's kind of like a fingerprint.  Everyone has a different mix.  So that's why everyone has kind of a different smell.  What might happen is you're used to your smell because that's what it smelled like your  whole life.  If someone else has a different mix of bacteria, makes a different smell, I'm not used to this. 
[01:25:30]  Jim Norton homage.  Wow.  Well, you know what?  Anthony goes, how do you know?  And it's just one of those things you answer with, I just know.  I just know.  Unfortunately, I can't give you the exact reason, but you just know.  You just know when you're smelling your own farts.  Attribute it to gnarly-isms.  Gnarly-isms.  Just gnarly-isms.  Yeah.  So every fart's like a snowflake, I guess, huh?  Snowflakes.  So sweet and nice and gentle. 
[01:26:00]  And every snowflake different.  We're all unique, like farts.  Has there ever been two farts exactly the same?  I don't know.  You'd have to smell a lot of ass to try to find that out.  I don't know.  Yeah.  If we smoked a little pot right now, we would discuss that for 20 minutes.  Oh, my God.  That would be a solid 20 minutes.  Fantastic.  All right, Mikey.  Thank you, brother.  The guy has a theory that the CIA is behind all of the uprisings. 
[01:26:30]  What?  No, man.  Because this whole thing's a hassle for the United States, right, Ant?  You know this better than I.  Yeah, it really is.  It's kind of a hassle.  We don't know who's going to run Egypt.  Why is the CIA stepping in to fuck with Muammar Gaddafi, who hasn't done shit in years?  He's an easy one to leave alone.  What has he really done?  He hasn't done anything in years.  I do believe that we're going to control who is the leader of Egypt.  We're going to have our hands involved in that.  You think that's going to be one of our moves?  Somehow, yeah. 
[01:27:00]  You think Rummy's got his lizards?  Yeah, Rummy's got his lizard clan.  His lizards?  I kind of believe that, that we help pick leaders from other places.  Yeah.  Maybe not totally, but we help out a little bit.  I know we used to be in that business a lot.  I think we still are.  A lot.  I think we still are.  Yeah?  I think it's more on the down low.  On the DL, as they say.  The DL.  Maybe there's a candidate that we like, so we pump him up a little bit.  In ways, I don't know. 
[01:27:30]  I don't know if we're really in that business, or if we can at this point with these fucking  protesters and everything.  I think it's tougher to be in that business, but you've got to think we do our best.  Who takes over for Gaddafi at this point?  That guy's been in charge for 40 fucking years.  Right.  Who now steps in there, a democratically elected government?  They don't even have the logistics in place to have free elections.  Oh, really? 
[01:28:00]  And it can't be set up.  No, they've been under a dictatorship for 40 fucking years.  How do you go about doing it?  The people don't even know what the fuck that's about.  Why doesn't Egypt just march in and make Egypt bigger?  Even Egypt doesn't know how to go about it.  It's just the most fucked up thing.  Did you see...  Oh, I asked you already.  I'm asking in the audience.  Idiot Abroad.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mickey Gervais' show.  Yeah.  They did Egypt.  They sent Carl to Egypt.  Oh, they did.  And I was thinking, wow, a lot of the people that Carl was talking about, I wonder if they're 
[01:28:30]  dead now.  Oh, man.  Yeah, they might have been gunned down.  Obviously before the uprising.  Yeah.  And then he goes to the pyramids and he goes, you know, you see this on TV and it looks like  it's in the middle of the desert and he shows like the angles they don't want to show you  because they're trying to get your tourist dollars where the dirty city's right behind  it.  It's right there.  I mean, if you take one angle, yeah, it looks like it's in the middle of nowhere, but it's  right there outside the city limits more or less.  And then they show all the fucking garbage. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  They don't even clean up the area.  It's a filthy place.  And he said there was a tornado of garbage.  He was calling it a little.  Yeah, but it looked cool.  It was kind of like the plastic bag scene in that movie there.  Help me out.  Beautiful.  The guy with the girl, the high school girl with the roses.  American beauty.  Oh, American beauty.  American beauty.  But there's Carl.  They're filming all these plastic bags just flying by his head and stuff.  Really filthy.  I like how he was talking about the design of the pyramids and how it wasn't a good design. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You got a lot on the first floor, but the attic is like really small.  You need a roomy attic.  Fucking retarded.  And then they filmed something brilliantly.  You know, if you've ever gone to a foreign country, I've been to one crazy foreign country.  That was Turkey.  I was in Istanbul.  And that was before 9-11, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've told the story many times.  Two days before 9-11 or one day before 9-11, we flew home, whatever.  But we were going through the market area. 
[01:30:00]  That's crazy.  And what sucks about these poor countries that you want to visit, you get hassled so much,  you can't enjoy yourself.  Oh, from beggars, right?  Beggars.  Well, because they need money.  Yeah.  You know, the average guy in Egypt makes nothing, right?  Yeah, bro.  So they showed Carl.  They filmed it beautifully where he's going through the market area and where a lot of  tourists go, and they showed him being bothered every single step he took.  And he would push one guy away like, nah, nah, nah, nah.  And the other guy was just waiting to take over.  Were they men or kids or women?  What were they? 
[01:30:30]  Mostly men.  Men?  Yeah, younger men.  But they would all be offering different stuff, too.  Oh, oh.  Watches, rugs, I don't know.  Yeah, like, oh, here's this guy, like, you know.  You saw it, Travis, huh?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so he would be walking through this courtyard, and one guy who owns a cafe is like, hey,  come get something to eat, and then he'd be done with that guy, and the next guy would  be offering him, you know, oh, come to my place for something to drink.  Right.  Oh, come to my place for something for dessert.  Well, you know.  And they're just lining up, just waiting for this.  And they're not, and they're harassing you, but they know their limits, too, because 
[01:31:00]  I'm sure whatever police force they have, they control it a little bit, because they  want the tourists.  They don't want them all pissed off for being harassed.  Travis, that was filmed really, really well, huh?  Oh, yeah, definitely.  They basically showed you can't walk around if you're a tourist in Egypt in some of these  places.  It's also what type of person you are.  Like, if you live in New York and you deal with that kind of stuff every day, you and  I, we're just walking through.  If you look like a mark, yeah.  But, like, Carl's just, like, stopping and actually talking to these people.  But it looked like he had no choice. 
[01:31:30]  I know what you're saying, Travis, but it looked like they were just, like...  They are everywhere, though.  Well, here's the deal, though.  We put up with shit like this when you ever go down to the Caribbean and fucking try to lay on  the beach and just fucking lay down and relax every two seconds.  Would you like the shirt?  Would you like the lady?  Would she like her braids?  Braids!  Braids!  Braids!  I don't go to those places anymore.  No?  No, because it is a pain in the ass.  It's a pain in the ass.  You're trying to take a nap on the beach, enjoying your corona or something, and every  two seconds.  I gave up on that. 
[01:32:00]  I know where you're talking.  Sometimes I don't want to fucking close my eyes and make believe I'm asleep.  I want to, like, you know, have a drink and watch the fucking beach, look at girl, whatever  the fuck you're doing.  And these motherfuckers just coming by trying to hawk their wares, not realizing you're not  the only fat fucking piece of shit on the beach trying to sell me shit.  Yeah.  I can't relax.  Shut up!  Istanbul was brutal.  There, though, they were obsessed with their dumb rugs.  They loved them rugs, huh?  And then, like, I did a cruise, and the cruise people are in cahoots with the locals, so they 
[01:32:30]  bring you to these places thinking it's a nice touristy thing, but no, it's a demonstration  on rugs and stuff, and they're trying to get you to buy rugs.  I'm like, what does this have to do with my trip?  Yeah.  Also, I'm at some Istanbul rug shop.  I need something to roll my wife up in and throw her overboard, please.  And then they're, like, making it easy where you can ship it back home, and I don't want  a rug.  What is this, like a timeshare meeting? 
[01:33:00]  It pretty much was.  They hook you up, like, hey, come down.  Yeah.  Under the guise that it's some kind of cool touristy thing, like, you know, they're known  for their rugs, so we're going to bring you to this place that's really cool, and you're  like, all right, I can check out how they make rugs or something.  Yeah, whatever.  But it's not that at all.  It's a showroom, and you're sitting there, and they're trying to sell you a rug for an  hour.  Yeah, I'd like to go there.  Maybe check out a new one.  You've never gone to a dirty place, huh?  A filthy place?  Let me think.  Oh, well, when I was a kid, Tijuana. 
[01:33:30]  Tijuana.  Went to TJ with the old man.  Holy shit.  Him and Chato Reyes.  Yeah, that's got to be crazy.  It was, yeah, talking about kids fucking begging.  They were the big things.  And then they took some poor fucking donkey, and they spray-painted him like a zebra.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then they make you take pictures with the spray-painted zebra donkey, and then the  kids are constantly begging and trying to sell you gum.  Right.  This fucking disgusting fucking gum with their dirty feet, nasty cans, fucking shit all 
[01:34:00]  over them.  You actually saw one of the painted zebras?  Oh, yeah.  That's really popular.  Yeah, with the big, dumb paper flower in his head, and when he's wearing a hat, like  looking all goofy, they cut holes in the hat brim, and then put his big, dumb donkey  ears through it.  He's spray-painted like a zebra.  Later on, they wash the zebra stripes off, and he's fucking some whore in some club downtown.  It's the same donkey she's sucking off.  He's multitasking.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the donkey.  He's like Charlie Sheen.  Many different ways.  Donkey ears. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, good old Kenny Powers, they did a little something with that on his show.  Yeah.  With the donkeys they paint into zebras.  And people are buying it like it's a zebra?  I don't know if anyone thinks that's a fucking zebra.  It's horrible.  Was the paint job bad?  It was really bad.  Really?  Bad paint job.  Bad zebra stripes.  They can't even find an artist to figure it out?  At least use an airbrush and maybe fucking look at a picture of a real zebra.  Right.  They'll just paint stripes on it.  Look like a tiger.  We got another microbiologist on the phone.  Oh.  Remember the fart guy?  Yes.  The only reason I went to him was because he was proving I was right. 
[01:35:00]  Uh-huh.  And now this microbiologist is going to say that that guy's full of shit.  Oh, my God.  Which is weird because we're talking about being full of shit.  Look at this.  It's like the science channel.  Lou, Pennsylvania.  Gentlemen, good morning.  Hey.  Mike from New Jersey is full of shit.  Oh.  99% of the bacteria in all of our stomachs are identical to each other.  So for him to suggest that farting is genetic, I think he's a little off base. 
[01:35:30]  Ah.  I love when microbiologists talk smack, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Moreover, the way your fart smell is largely dependent on the diet that you have.  Right.  So the way your fart smells on Tuesday is going to smell a hell of a lot different than the  way your fart smells the following Tuesday.  Right.  Because the bacteria in your stomach is a result of what you eat.  So over time, it changes. 
[01:36:00]  So I don't know really what the hell he's talking about.  Oh, that sucks.  Say again now.  We're just a fucking, I'm in a quandary about this.  Yeah.  I need an answer, but I don't know how to get one.  Yeah, we might have to go to Dr. Steve.  Yeah, you need to set up a controlled experiment with a series of controls, a double blind study  so they don't know, you know, the people don't know that they're smelling their own farts or  what's going on.  Very complicated, Anthony.  Very complicated. 
[01:36:30]  Very.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  Let's go to Austria.  Ah.  We're in Austria.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  What?  Heil.  Hi.  Heil.  Yeah, I was in Egypt a couple of years ago for a school trip.  Oh, I thought you were trying to take it over or something.  Get it?  How the fuck?  North Africa, cool.  Meh.  Meh.  How the fuck did you discover the Opie and Anthony show in Austria? 
[01:37:00]  I've been listening to you guys for years.  I'm originally from the States, but I grew up overseas.  Okay.  You know, I don't want to brag, but I bet I bring in a lot of the Austrian listeners with  some of my viewpoints.  What time is it in Austria?  Just trying to get a feel here.  I'm going to guess.  Let's try this.  Time to hate Jews?  I'm going to go with two in the afternoon.  Exactly.  Whoa!  See, I might not know that Libya is part of Africa, but damn, I know my fucking time zone. 
[01:37:30]  What time it is in Austria.  How much is a train?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't have to do the train anymore.  Get you a cup of coffee or something.  What do you got on the shitty pyramids, it says here?  Oh.  I was there a couple of years ago, and you get there, everything's in organized buses  and everything.  Yeah.  There's a couple of Egyptian secret police or whatever standing around with AKs.  That's a secret, I guess.  No, they're not secret. 
[01:38:00]  This guy's pointing them out.  Right.  But yeah, they're just standing around with AKs, and there's just peddlers everywhere,  just like you said, Ope.  Like in the markets, kids are running up to you trying to give you shitty toys made out  of sand that crumble within hours, and there's not much to see, and everywhere around, the  whole city is just one big ghetto.  There's a couple of Western places which are just meant for the tourists, but otherwise,  the city is just a large shithole. 
[01:38:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  It's scary, man.  And there's just garbage everywhere around the pyramids, right?  Garbage.  They don't really give a fuck about the image.  It's just, it's in the outer skirts of the city, and it's surrounded by the slums, and  it's nothing special.  And what they showed last night when I was watching Idiot Abroad, I'm a little behind,  I did the Egypt episode.  You get up close to the pyramids, Ant, this looks like a pile of rocks.  Yeah, from a distance, they look very...  From a distance, it looks really smooth. 
[01:39:00]  Sharp edges and everything.  Nice, right?  Yeah.  But you get close, and it's just a pile of rocks.  Big pile of rocks.  The edges aren't very...  Well, willy-nilly.  Very sharp, dare I say.  And then you're allowed to just climb up them?  What?  They used to allow it, but after a while, they kind of figured out that, oh, we might want  to keep these things under conservation, so they stopped along it.  What's going to happen?  People have been climbing up them for thousands of years.  Exactly.  All of a sudden, now, we're so fucking...  Well, the world is getting heavier. 
[01:39:30]  You know, people are a little more obese now.  Nice trim person just running up the side of the pyramid.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Let me go to Tim in Pittsburgh.  I'll meet you, Zane.  Tim.  Hey, yeah, you guys were talking about being in the Caribbean and those jackasses coming  and trying to sell you shit.  Yes.  I went to Morocco.  I was in Europe in the late 90s, and we took a boat over to Morocco.  And as soon as you get off the boat, you get into the port. 
[01:40:00]  There's about 500 local Moroccan guys, and they want to take you and show you around the  city.  And we didn't know where we were going.  Everybody does it.  So we get one.  And he takes us all over.  He takes us to this place.  We get some couscous and all that.  And then he's like, I'm going to take you guys...  Food's so nice, they named it twice.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he's like, I'm going to take you to the art college.  And we're like, okay, the art college.  And it turned out to be this big frickin' rugs factory. 
[01:40:30]  The rugs.  And the whole time, I'm like, I'm not buying any of this shit.  But I'm telling you, they kept us there for 45 minutes.  And finally, I'm like, fine, I'll just buy something just so we can get out of there.  Do the drivers get a kickback, you think, to take these people to that place?  Yeah, they make deals.  I'm telling you.  Wow.  Fuck that noise.  And then, to top it off, I spent all my money on this rug.  And we go and stay at this shitty-ass hotel.  And I don't have any money for dinner, so I ate soup.  And because I ate soup in Morocco, I had fuckin' diarrhea for the next 10 days in Europe. 
[01:41:00]  I'm shitting out of...  I'm pissing out of my ass.  Oh, God.  All over the globe.  I just picture a map of Europe, and instead of the dotted line, it's just a line of diarrhea  through all of the countries that he visited.  Big splat on France.  You know old school movies and stuff, when they show someone traveling?  Yeah, yeah.  And it's a line?  Yeah, the line.  It's just diarrhea.  I gotcha.  Right.  Wah.  Or instead of an airplane, it's a toilet bowl, just moving.  That sounds like a shitty trip. 
[01:41:30]  That's horrible.  And I'm not even kidding.  Yeah.  Just that 10 days is necessary.  Why would you...  Like, I don't know.  I go on a cruise.  I'm going to be going on a cruise this spring, and a lot of the ports, I don't like dealing  with the local fucking shysters that are just waiting for you.  The second they see those fat, fucking lovely, fat Americans getting off that boat, they just  know.  They start coming.  Dollar signs.  And they're like, we'll take you here, we'll do this, we'll do that. 
[01:42:00]  I'm like, I go, no.  You don't get off the boat?  Oh, I get off the boat, but I tell them where I want to go.  Right.  I go, here's where I want to go, take me there.  I'm like, I'm not going on a tour that you're fucking doing.  If you were any good, you wouldn't be a cab driver, you'd be a tour guide or some shit.  You're driving a shitty fucking thing, the steering wheel's on the wrong side.  You drive like shit.  Yeah, Istanbul was part of the trip of the Greek islands, and then I remember now, there's  another port.  I forgot the fucking island.  They all start looking the same after a while. 
[01:42:30]  And they brought us to a jewelry store.  Same shit.  Like, they know where to take you.  Fuck that.  There's someone on the cruise ship, knowing they're taking you to these places once a  week or once every two weeks, I don't know, however their schedules are, and they stop  off at the jewelry store, because they get a kickback if you're buying local jewelry.  The places that are set up right outside the ship and things like that, the little shops  and stuff, because they know the ships are coming.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I don't mind those.  No, they drag any of these places.  But you're not going to fucking drive me over Hill and Dale. 
[01:43:00]  And there's always a reason.  I forgot what that was, because this is many years ago.  We're talking right around 9-11.  Yeah.  So, what, 10 years ago?  Right?  What are we up to?  Yeah, 10 years.  Yeah, about.  Holy shit.  Yeah, but there was a reason why they had to take us to the local jewelry store.  Really?  And then you'd get in there, and it's like, oh, I see.  They want you to buy jewelry here, because this woman's going to get a kickback.  Thanks.  Jet ski.  Jet ski.  Oh, yeah.  Jet skis.  Jet skis.  Jet skis.  Jet skis.  Shut up. 
[01:43:30]  Paris was the worst.  100 different vendors in Paris.  Oh, Billy.  That must be great.  Let's go to the Eiffel Tower.  They're just waiting for you.  They're just waiting to sap you.  Look at their dumb French stupid thing with no walls on it.  Great.  You have a framework.  Nice.  It's an unfinished building.  Let's go see it.  We got Mike in Jersey.  Hi, Mike.  Mike, are you the other Mike that turned out to be wrong?  No, I told the call guy that I'm not microbiologist Mike. 
[01:44:00]  Okay, good.  What do you got?  There was an experiment that I was reading about this in a baby book, that they put a bunch  of shitty baby diapers out, and they had a bunch of moms come in, and each mom was able  to pick out their own baby shit.  So, Opie's definitely right.  I completely believe that.  I have smelled baby shit in my day.  Oh, yes.  You've had it under your nose.  And it'll knock you the fuck out.  My kid, I forgot to mention this, a milestone. 
[01:44:30]  His shit smells like shit.  Oh, it's finally there?  His shit finally smells like shit.  It's brutal.  Really?  But, within a week or two, you're used to his shit.  But if a foreign baby came to my house, and they changed a diaper in my house, I don't  think the nationality has anything to do with it.  I would be out of my mind smelling someone else's kid shit.  Absolutely.  You're right there, Mike.  Do you pick him up and stick your nose in his ass to see if he's gone?  I'm that guy. 
[01:45:00]  It makes it easier, because it's like rustling a fucking calf or something when you try to  change their diaper.  It's a nightmare.  So, if you know ahead of time that you don't have to open up that diaper to check, you're  saving yourself a lot of work.  Really?  A lot of work.  Travis, you smell the ass end of your kid?  Yeah, you can pick him up and smell the ass, or you can just kind of open up the top of  the diaper.  That's disgusting.  But sometimes you know.  They make faces.  I'd rather just pour a glass of wine and smell that before I take a sip. 
[01:45:30]  I understand.  I don't know.  Smelling a baby's ass for shit.  Someone was telling me the other day I got it easy, because eventually they take their  diapers off and start rubbing shit everywhere.  My kid's not doing that.  Cave painting?  What are they doing?  How the fuck do they take their own diaper off, unless you're letting them wander around  with just a diaper on?  Some people do, I think.  Fuck that.  Other kids just take their pants off.  They're just like, eh.  There's nothing more awkward than being over someone's house with a kid that's that age,  and they just fucking take their clothes off, and they're walking around. 
[01:46:00]  It's like, could you just not?  You don't want to be tempted.  Yeah, tempted.  That's it.  That's what the joke is, of course.  I know.  I'm sorry.  It's so hacked.  It really is hacked.  Which is fine.  But the truth of the matter is, the truth is, it's just an awkward situation to be in.  Yeah, it's uncomfortable.  You don't want a kid just, we talked about that years ago on the beach when they let  the kid run around, and that was where Puffy Vag came from.  Right.  Where I was laying on a blanket, and I just heard some footsteps next to me, and I opened 
[01:46:30]  my eyes, and standing, like, a foot away from me, is a naked little girl, and a giant, actual  size vagina.  Are they?  Are vaginas actual size?  I was going to ask you, is it like eyeballs?  You know how your eyeballs are the same size your whole life?  Your eyeballs are the same size when you're born, you're growing.  Is the vagina the same size?  I truly believe that a vag is born the same size.  That's hilarious.  And then girls just grow into them.  More importantly, I said it the other day, I'll say it again, when you become a father, 
[01:47:00]  you become aware of the creeps out there.  I don't know what kind of parent you are that you allow your kid to be naked on a beach,  because the pervs are everywhere.  It's like, why would you?  Especially, yeah, I would almost understand, like, your son, whatever, but, like, I think  you're way more protective with a girl.  I'm assuming I'm not in that world yet.  Yeah.  And you got, like, you just said, a young...  Oh, she's like 17, 18 years old, and she's naked.  It's just...  And you gotta lick all the sand out of her vagina.  Jesus.  But how is a father, you just can accept that? 
[01:47:30]  I know.  Knowing that there has to be creeps around.  There has to be, if it's a crowded beach.  Well, you know what?  I was watching that goddamn Toddlers in Tiaras and Little Miss Perfect, and the father's  on that show.  It's like, how do you allow your daughter to dress like a complete fucking whore?  Yeah, that's even bad.  You're right.  And shake her ass and do, like, dance moves that are done in strip clubs.  Right.  And the father's like, well, you know, I think it's teaching her a lot of confidence. 
[01:48:00]  The mother and her get along just great at these pageants, and we sit and watch, and  we're very proud of her.  And there she is in a fucking midriff top with hot pants on, pretty much diddling herself  and shaking her ass to the judges.  I'm for allowing everything for the most part.  But that's one of those things I'm like, they should just outlaw it.  It just doesn't seem right.  There's something just really wrong with that. 
[01:48:30]  It just doesn't seem right.  We should go to one.  Oh, my God.  Do they come to Jersey?  I don't even know if they come to this area.  We should find out.  You want to talk about making some videos.  Little Miss Perfect pageant.  We should go.  Yeah.  We should go.  Oh, God.  And check it out live.  We should enter someone in it.  Uh, big A.  It's time for well wear.  I'm in a little tiny shirt.  A little bippy shirt.  He's got to sing that song, though. 
[01:49:00]  Little Miss Perfect pageant.  Could we...  He's wearing those little socklets.  Could we have them all dressed for the pageant and then go to the table where you have to sign  up your little girl?  Oh, God.  And try to sign them up.  Here, uh...  Here's our little...  Our little, uh...  Our Little Miss Perfect.  Andy, we like to call her.  Right.  We should have a Little Miss Perfect pageant.  Big A and fucking dumb bobo.  That's not a bad idea.  Now you're talking. 
[01:49:30]  A Little Miss to do wow wear.  A Little Miss Perfect pageant with the creeps.  We have question and answer.  And then we have wow wear where they have to wow the judges with what they're doing.  Like a little dance number in very revealing clothing.  And then the beauty segment where it's like a gown and they have to be very poised.  Oh, my God.  Slowly turning their head.  Why don't we do a Little Miss Perfect?  I know.  Big A's in.  Pat from Menaki would do this in a second.  Pat would do it.  Yeah, Pat.  You're in, Pat?  Uh, stalker Patty.  Of course, you've got to bring the bobo. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Even though he hasn't been on the show for a while, which is good.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  But, uh, I think he would be good at that.  We're going to have to.  Pat says, oh, yeah, he's in.  We're going to have to think that one over.  Yeah.  A Little Miss Perfect pageant.  That could work.  With dumb Patty.  Did you get the little girl's number that you saw naked at the beach?  No, I didn't get her number.  Jesus Christ.  A lot of phone calls, but I think.  It's, you know, with all joking aside, it's so uncomfortable for somebody to do that because  you're like, you're trying to just not look at the dumb naked kid because it's just 
[01:50:30]  uncomfortable.  Yeah.  So now you're looking all around the beach or the house or wherever the fuck you are.  I don't get that.  Taking pictures of when we spilt the paint.  I think if you're kind of at a, I don't know, like a private beach or something, but like  a public beach, maybe the parents would argue it's a lot easier.  And they don't even watch the kid.  It's running all over the place, just naked.  Right.  Sand all over the place.  Maybe a Sandy Diaper is not fun or something. 
[01:51:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's a radio name you went by before BAB, wasn't it?  Sandy Diaper?  Yeah, Sandy Diaper.  I was Sandy Diaper here.  In the morning.  In the morning.  Sandy Diaper.  Dr. Steve, Ant's got a very good question.  Dr. Steve.  Okay, I knew you were going to go to me now because I just walked into my kid's daycare.  Hang on a second.  Oh.  Speaking of.  A little rough drop on the F-bomb in the middle of a...  I wonder where they learned that from. 
[01:51:30]  Well, we certainly don't have to do this today.  It's just nonsense if you need to know the truth.  Yeah, well...  I was going to tell you, my very first memory was taking a shit in my crib.  Really?  I felt very creative, and I remember painting the walls with me.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  And wondering why, when my mother came in, I thought she would be so proud of me.  Oh.  And why she was so upset. 
[01:52:00]  So it's, yeah, definitely something to look forward to.  Good luck with that.  I guess that's happening.  Good luck, bro.  I was like 18 months old.  But there's the kid update today.  My kid's shit finally smells like shit.  Congrats.  Thank you.  It's a milestone.  Being a father, that's one of the milestones you look forward to.  Milestone.  Yeah.  He's eating meat now, I'm assuming.  Oh, yeah, that must be it, right?  Yeah, meat will always make it to a sting.  A little meat.  And a lot of yogurt to eat. 
[01:52:30]  Really?  Things like that?  Yogurt chips.  Dr. Steve, are you prepared for a question?  Certainly, my friend.  All right.  I don't even know how you would answer this.  I think it's more of a psychological and physiological thing.  But let's say you have two people in a room.  People neither know what's going on with this little experiment.  They fart at exactly the same time, but it's silent.  Neither one knows the other one farted. 
[01:53:00]  One is having farts that really smell bad.  The other one is having farts that have no fragrance at all.  Right.  Would the person, knowing that you're not offended by your own fart smell,  as you are someone else's,  smelling that, the person that made the fart that didn't smell,  but not knowing the other person farted,  and smelling that person's fart,  thinking it's his own fart,  would he be put off by the smell,  or think it was his, 
[01:53:30]  and have that sick enjoyment of it,  as we do as humans?  That is a really great thought experiment.  It really is,  and I don't even know how you'd do it without tipping the people off,  and then they'd have to fart at the same time.  It would, it's...  My answer is that you just know.  You just know your own fart.  So, and you're a human being,  so you would,  you quickly would think,  okay, he had to have farted when I farted.  You think it's like a puppy,  like a dog could smell puppies and know it's its own puppy? 
[01:54:00]  Here's the thing.  I'm telling you.  I think that there's more to it than just the smell.  I think that the body knows  what direction that fart cloud is coming from.  Really?  I really do,  because I've had this experience before  where I could tell which person in the room fucking farted.  Oh, because it didn't come from...  Yeah, okay.  It didn't come from my side of the room.  It came from another side of the room,  and I could kind of pinpoint with my nose 
[01:54:30]  just by the gradient of...  Yes.  You know, which person laid that fart.  And you always know when you're in a room  and someone's laying stinky farts,  pretty much which person did it.  Right.  And I think that that would have to be...  To really do a controlled experiment,  you would have to bottle these farts  and then use a double-blinded method  of reintroducing the farts to their nose. 
[01:55:00]  To their nose.  with some type of sensor  so you would know when the person farted.  So you could then...  Well, they'd have to fart into a...  basically into a vacuum bottle,  and then you'd have to reintroduce that  in a double-blinded way to those people  to see if your theory is right  that people can identify their own...  Right.  I would think that they cannot.  Now you're in MythBuster territory,  so maybe we should give this question  to the MythBusters.  Yeah.  Would they take this one on?  Make a whole show about it?  Well, you know... 
[01:55:30]  It might be too dirty.  We did Medical MythBusters on my show.  Yes.  It might be something we could try.  Medical MythBusters.  Because we did the vaginal tampon  of Medical MythBusters.  Not vaginal tampon, sorry.  Vodka tampon.  Vodka tampon.  Yes, vodka tampon.  And we busted that myth, so...  Did she get drunk?  No, absolutely not.  And we had a breathalyzer,  and she didn't blow.  She blew absolutely nothing,  or none of us,  so we knew she wasn't drunk.  So you can't get drunk  from a vodka-soaked tampon, 
[01:56:00]  is what you learned.  No, the vagina is not designed  to absorb things.  Now, if you took that tampon,  and please, kids,  don't try this at home,  but if you shoved it up your ass,  then you would get drunk.  But that's...  Well, how do you know?  Did you guys try that?  Yeah.  No, but the colon  is well known for absorbing alcohol.  Well, why don't you try it  before you start saying that?  I think it is, right?  There's a lot of...  Like, how does it absorb?  Just through the thin walls? 
[01:56:30]  Well, yeah.  The colon,  the large intestine,  is designed to absorb fluid,  because that's what it does.  Fluid.  Fluid.  It takes a stool  and prints it into the earth.  Yeah.  Huh.  So, people have died  from doing champagne enemas  and stuff like that.  We had a couple of cases  when I was a medical examiner.  Wow.  People who gave themselves  champagne enemas  and they died from alcohol toxicity.  You were a medical examiner, too? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, when I was in Vermont, yeah.  Wow.  What a cool.  Yeah, I forgot, I guess.  I'm sorry.  You...  Yeah, that was...  That was really creepy.  No shit.  What was the worst one you saw?  Uh, saw...  Um...  I saw a suicide  and it was with a 38 Magnum  and there was a perfect  half...  perfect anatomic specimen  of a half brain  laying in the snow. 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  It was just...  Wow.  That is...  No, it looked completely  non-traumatic.  You know, it just looked like  somebody had done a surgical  or a, you know,  an anatomical specimen.  It just fell out of his head.  Yeah.  Damn.  I don't know how you do that.  Was he dead?  Yeah, I'm going to call this one, guys.  Right, right, right. 
[01:58:00]  All right, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, thank you so much.  Give me a little more information  on this thing.  I'm going to continue this.  I'm smelling farts  and Nobel Prize.  Yeah, you're not giving up  on this one?  Yes.  We may try it on our show.  By the way,  we're on tomorrow night,  Weird Medicine at midnight.  Nice.  Weird Medicine,  midnight Eastern,  right here on our channel.  Dr. Steve, Weird Medicine.  It truly is a great show.  Yes, it is.  And Dr. Steve really liked  the Louis C.K.,  Are You a Lizard? 
[01:58:30]  Donald Rumsfeld thing yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was absolutely brilliant.  Yeah, it's making the rounds, too.  The video's doing well for Louis.  I think, you know,  Louis' show may be  one of the best shows  that's ever been on TV.  I know.  It's fucking great.  Every fucking minute  of that show.  Yeah.  You know what?  For the next season.  We brought up Louis C.K.  I showed Anthony  something in the paper today.  Being famous is really,  really weird.  The Daily News  here in New York,  they have a picture  of Chris Rock  at the Knicks game  because, you know, 
[01:59:00]  Carmelo Anthony  made the debut.  Oh.  And Chris Rock  is courtside,  so they're like  Chris Rock  at the Knicks game.  Yeah.  And in the picture,  you see half  of Louis C.K.'s face  with no mention  that it's Louis C.K.  And I'm thinking  it's got to suck  to be Louis C.K.  He's got his own TV show.  He's been in movies.  Yeah.  He's...  Right.  And I'm going to say this.  Right now,  I think he's funnier  than Chris Rock, even.  I know they're good friends,  so if I said that  in front of Louis,  he would downplay it. 
[01:59:30]  But in my dumb little mind,  I think Louis C.K.  is funnier  than Chris Rock right now  and gets no credit  that he was at the Knicks game  or any credit  in this picture.  Matter of fact,  I told Ann,  I bet you they had  a picture of Louis C.K.  and Chris Rock together,  but chose the other one  where you see  just kind of his nose  and a piece of his eye  and his forehead.  You'd think they would put  Chris Rock and Louis C.K.  watch the game.  Right.  Yeah, and I'm thinking  Louis C.K.  No, nothing.  But I'm thinking  Louis C.K.  has reached this level of fame, 
[02:00:00]  but he's still not getting noticed  by the people  that notice that stuff?  Not next to Chris Rock.  Doesn't make sense to me.  It's the Adam Sandler syndrome.  What do you mean?  Well, it's like Adam Sandler.  They'd be taking pictures  and going crazy over him,  and do you really think  that's funny?  Do you really think  that's funny?  Who?  Adam Sandler.  I never thought he was funny.  I think he's made  a couple good movies.  I thought he was funny  when he was on remote control  with fucking,  when he was Stunt Boy  or whatever he was.  Some of the SNL stuff  was funny. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I hear you.  It's just weird  seeing that picture today,  knowing that we know  Louis so well,  and that obviously  has a great career  going for himself.  You know,  critically acclaimed,  that show of his.  Yeah.  And, you know,  he puts a video up on YouTube.  It does two,  three million views,  no problem.  I know.  But they're like,  yeah,  here's Chris Rock  in the game  not acknowledging  that Louis  is right the fuck there  and really funny  and really talented.  So,  really strange.  All right, Steve.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, we'll be listening  tomorrow night.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back,  Patrice O'Neal  joins the program.  Patrice-y.  And Pat Cooper's coming in  at nine o'clock  to say hi.  Oh, boy.  I don't think he's promoting anything.  Hold on to your hats.  Why?  We get to leave  at nine, basically.  No,  it is a chore  when he's in.  I've got to be honest.  It's a chore.  He just,  it's like,  I can't keep up  with that.  He's like  old Charlie Sheen. 
[02:01:30]  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  I'm a P-51 Mustang.  He's got to go  in older planes.  Want to play  the what game today?  What?  I've been meaning  to play that.  I know, right?  What?  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  Well,  we're all in.  All right.  Hey,  Oscars on Sunday,  so we got an Oscar moment  for everybody.  The Opie and Anthony Show  proudly presents  Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes  from Academy Award 
[02:02:00]  nominated films.  And now,  here's Oscar.  Nominated for  ten Academy Awards  including  performance by an actor  in a leading role,  performance by an actress  in a supporting role,  and best picture,  True Grit.  Presented by  Roland Campos  and Rich Voss.  All right,  Mr. Cogburn,  in four years  as U.S. Marshal,  how many men  have you shot?  I never shot anybody  I didn't have to.  Well,  that was not to question  how many.  Shot or killed.  Let us restrict you  to killed 
[02:02:30]  so that we may have  a manageable figure.  About 12,  15,  stopping men in flight,  defending myself,  et cetera,  et cetera,  et cetera.  Around 12,  he says,  or 15,  so many that you  cannot keep  a precise count.  I've examined the records  and can supply  the accurate figure.  Well,  I believe them  two war tones  make it 23.  And how many of,  and how many members  of this one family,  the Wharton family,  have you killed? 
[02:03:00]  Immediate or?  Did you also shoot  Dub Wharton,  brother,  and Cleet Wharton,  half-brother?  Oh,  Cleet was selling  odd and spirits  to the Cherokees.  He come at me  with a king bolt.  A king bolt?  Now you are armed  and he advanced  upon you  with nothing more  than a king bolt  from a wagon tongue?  I've seen men  badly torn up  with things  no bigger  than a king bolt.  I defended myself.  Return to the other  encounter  with Aaron Warren  and his two  remaining sons. 
[02:03:30]  You sprang from cover  with revolver in hand.  I did.  Loaded and cocked?  Well,  if it ain't loaded  and cocked,  it don't shoot.  And like his son,  Aaron Warren,  advanced against  an armed man?  Well,  he was armed.  He had the axe  raised.  Now,  I believe you testified  that you backed away  from Aaron Warren.  Which direction  were you going?  I always go backwards  when I'm backing up.  Stay tuned  for more 
[02:04:00]  Oscar moments  presented by  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM,  the virus.  This is  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Patrice O'Neill  in the studio  taking advantage  of the fact  that Jimmy's been gone 
[02:04:30]  all week,  so we made sure  we got a bunch  of Patrice O'Neill  for you this week.  Big Mama Prods.  Who's still waiting  for fame to call?  I just asked him.  Has fame called?  Because the big special  from Comedy Central  was great.  Everyone enjoyed it  and now they're  buying the DVD.  It did well.  I don't know.  You want to?  You can go there  if you want.  Can you hear this?  Yeah.  And then your DVD  was up on the charts.  Did well.  I guess.  I don't know 
[02:05:00]  what happens.  But I'm trying to  ride whatever  is going on.  Ride the wave.  People are very nice  as I tell you that  fucking much.  People enjoyed it.  It didn't get  a lukewarm response.  People enjoyed it.  People fucking  really dug it.  And we got  Pat Cooper coming  in at nine.  When Patrice  entered the studio  I asked him about  his Celtics.  I'm not all in  with the NBA.  I can't front.  I'm starting to get  really interested  in the Knicks  obviously because  of the big trade.  So I think I'm going  to be back in  for the rest of the year  and then next year 
[02:05:30]  I think I'll have  a lot more knowledge  as far as the NBA goes.  With that said,  the Celtics  made a big trade  yesterday  that I didn't even  understand  and I don't really  know.  I would call it  a dumb trade.  I wouldn't call it  a big trade.  And then Danny Ainge  was trending  all over Twitter  yesterday because  everyone was outraged  going what the fuck  is wrong with this guy?  Right?  What did they do?  What?  Oh, now you're  distracted.  What happened?  It was showing  bestsellers.  I'm number one on  You didn't know that?  Amazon.com 
[02:06:00]  Amazon.com and comedy.  Number one DVD.  I think I got a lot  of red savings.  Huh?  Slashes.  A lot of slash marks.  Look at all them  fucking stars.  And 21 used.  What?  It just came out.  Used.  People are watching  it and then reselling it.  Motherfuckers.  That's horrible.  What's going on?  What assholes?  21 used have sold.  The thing's been out  three days.  What?  What if it's used?  Three days?  Let's see the reviews.  That's what I need  that for my...  Used very good. 
[02:06:30]  I don't understand.  Oh, 21 are being sold.  I see.  Okay.  Used.  That's smart if you  think about it.  No, it's not.  He's probably putting it  on his Kaleidoscape  and fucking...  Please tell me  why this used...  Selling it.  It came out two days ago.  Because what their...  Ant just nailed it.  They put it on their  hard drives and shit.  They put it on their  Mac or their iPad, right?  Well, I guess you could do it.  They upload it to the  Pirate Bay and then  they return it.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  It is pirated, though.  Yeah.  Already.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:07:00]  I mean, pirated like...  The face is there.  The whole thing is like  it's there.  Yeah.  That's fucking smart, though.  You buy it, you upload it  to your shit, and then you  sell it and get a few  bucks back.  Sorry, but it's...  Oh, that's...  Are you apologizing to me?  That's pretty smart.  I didn't...  I didn't do a do-it-yourself  where...  Yeah.  I have a multi-billion dollar  conglomerate that has a  fucking piracy department.  I don't...  I just took the money  and let it...  I need more exposure  than I need DVD sale monies. 
[02:07:30]  I need to fucking exist.  So it's not hurting you  in the end.  Get some good product  out there.  You know, they want to  get their money back,  so I mean, I think, you  know, Comedy Central  has a department that  makes sure...  Either way, it's number  one.  That's awesome for Patrice.  But quickly, Patrice,  this trade the Celtics  made.  What do you want to know  about it?  This fucking sucks.  Well, you know...  They got rid of Kendrick  fucking Perkins, man.  And Nate, they got rid of...  Here's who they got rid of.  Okay, the main big guys  are hurt.  And I mean hurt and old.  The two O'Neils, okay? 
[02:08:00]  So they got rid of  Kendrick Perkins,  who's just coming back  from his knee injury,  but he's getting better  and better.  And then they got rid of  this other fucking Russian  who was a serviceable,  young, rebounding guy.  And they got rid of  their fucking...  Their back-up point guard  and Nate Robinson  who's an explosive  and they traded him  for a mid-level  fucking four.  And Jeff Green...  No one lets go  of young, 
[02:08:30]  like,  threes  who gonna be a superstar.  They're just too valuable.  Who lets them go?  It's something about  Jeff Green  that Oklahoma's like,  nah,  it ain't happening.  He's just not...  He's just not a guy  who's gonna...  He's not a beast.  He's just talented.  He's a guy that probably  wanted to do art,  but he was 6'8".  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  He's like,  he's not doing basketball  because he has other things.  He probably likes to take 
[02:09:00]  pictures and shit.  Other things he'd rather do,  but no one's taking him seriously.  So basically,  you went from a team  that everyone in the league,  okay,  every single person  who does basketball shit  says the Celtics were  in the top three teams  to win the championship.  And like you said,  they beat the Heat  three times this year already.  They beat the Heat  three times.  So why are you making  any changes  getting later in the season  like this?  I was listening to  Mike and Mike over here  because I can't listen  to the show no more  because it's serious 
[02:09:30]  and XM don't come together.  What do you mean?  What do you got?  I got a series radio.  So we got to get you  the best of XM.  They got to hook him up  so he can get...  But that's what I'm trying  to get is the best of XM,  but I don't know  how to get it.  Like, I don't know  what to do.  How about we ask somebody  and they hook Patrice up?  Can we have that?  Like, all they have  is XM.  It's just XM.  I mean, not XM.  I'm sorry.  It's just serious.  You need the best of XM package.  What is Patrice  going to give to us?  Oh, maybe, you know,  coming in and doing the show.  So I don't know 
[02:10:00]  what's going on.  You're like, listen,  I can come in here  and go, you guys  was talking about something earlier.  Yeah, exactly.  So I was listening  to Mike and Mike  and basically they was like,  well, maybe,  maybe the Celtics,  the Celtics are trending  towards what's going on  in their division,  which is small ball.  Like, everybody's going to go  to try to challenge  the fucking Heat,  but the Heat  lost to the Celtics  three times  all fucking ready  because they have size.  they just have bodies  that just pound you 
[02:10:30]  and pound you  and then they also have guys  that can score.  Like, what do they do?  No one knows.  Nobody who's a professional  sports person  has come up with a reason  why Danny Ainge did this.  They just can't figure it out.  And the arrogance  of him not saying,  listen, I hear the feedback.  I fucked up.  Or, here's why I did this.  But what it seems to me  is that he tanked the season.  Like, he said,  we gotta get young  because we're too old. 
[02:11:00]  He doesn't,  maybe he doesn't believe  that that team  was gonna win  and he's trying to keep  the Celtics  from being the Cleveland  Cavaliers.  But who gives a shit?  The Celtics didn't win  a championship  for 23 years,  86.  So, 2008,  22 years  the Celtics went  without winning  a championship.  Wow.  So, they can get  one last shot to win  and then gut the team  for another 22  fucking years.  All of a sudden  we're winners?  This is what makes me sick  about these 
[02:11:30]  fucking Boston teams  and Boston  fucking arrogance.  They were losers.  We don't come,  Boston does not come  from a tradition  of many  Super Bowls.  This is true.  In the last  decade,  the Patriots  was good,  the Sox  are good,  and now  two years ago  the Celtics  got good again  and the Bruins  haven't been good  forever.  Okay?  So,  cut the fucking  shit  with the 
[02:12:00]  we're winners.  You're not  fucking winners.  I'm from there.  You can say that shit  to everybody else.  We're competitive.  I put us in the same  category with Philly.  Philly's not winners  but they fucking  love sports.  Yep.  That's what Boston does.  Sports fans.  Great.  Enjoy the fucking  three Super Bowls.  Why are you  placing pressure  to win now?  Did you forget  there's people  who were born  slaves and died  and didn't see  the fucking  Red Sox ever win?  There's people 
[02:12:30]  who live full  healthy lives  and died at 90  and never saw  the fucking  Red Sox win.  Shit.  Same thing  with the Patriots.  We got beaten  every Super Bowl  we went in.  Destroyed by  the 85 Bears.  Beat by the  Green Bay Packers.  We're not  a special team.  We just run  with Brady  and Belichick  and this is what  they're doing.  Belichick's doing  the same thing.  Let's ship out  the old gangsters  get these new guys  in and they  fucking don't win.  It's back to normal. 
[02:13:00]  Losing is normal  for Boston.  It's not fucking  winning is not normal.  Well your black Celtics  fucked up.  They fucked up.  I mean because a lot  of people would say  that the Heat are  one of the teams  to beat obviously  and if you're already  beating them  three times  because the Heat  aren't going to  Boston and just  they're trying  really hard to win.  They're not just  going through the  motions when they  play the Celtics.  Some of these  teams they look  at the schedule  like we could  go through the  motions a little  bit for this 
[02:13:30]  team or whatever  but when they're  playing the Celtics  it's a huge game.  It's always  televised and all  that and they  beat them three  times.  He gutted the  season.  He gutted the  season.  Seriously.  It's weird.  He just said  fuck the season.  Let's build for  the future.  What future?  I was reading  Danny Ainge  tweets yesterday  because it was  trending and  everyone was  trying to figure  it out.  No one had a  real answer.  Why would he  gut a season to  rebuild for a team  that hasn't won  in 22 years?  We have to think  right now.  Why else did 
[02:14:00]  you get O'Neal  to win now?  Yeah to have  five.  Granted he's on  the other side  of his career  but still he's  got the experience  and the huge  fucking body.  They got him  to win now.  He's good for  one quarter.  That's all you  need.  Oh boy.  Is that what  it's down to?  Patrice is so  wrong.  The 2000s were  great for Boston  sports and the  teams are still  competitive.  That's what I said  the last decade.  The 2000s is this  decade.  He didn't listen  to you.  What the fuck  you talking about?  It's 2011.  I'm not talking  about the decade  of 2020. 
[02:14:30]  I'm talking about  the last decade.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Shut the fuck up.  You don't even know  what you're talking  about.  You in Connecticut.  You're on the fringe  of enjoying New  England sports  motherfucker.  You're a could be.  You're in the tri-state.  Yeah.  He could be a New  York fan easily.  New York fan.  Shut the fuck up.  And people would  accept that.  I'm fucking from  there.  From there.  86 was the last  Celtics win.  We'll give you  Hartford.  Hartford people are  Boston fans for the  most part.  But the rest of the  Connecticut could go  either way, man. 
[02:15:00]  You better get that  Whalers back before.  Kevin could be  walking around with a  Knicks jersey and no one  would question it.  What is he talking  about?  It's like they won  in 2000.  They won three Super  Bowls.  Okay.  Which was tremendous.  But that one that  they beat the fucking  the Rams.  When they beat the  Rams, that was enough  for me.  The other two was like  icing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Icing.  Like that was amazing  that they won.  I couldn't.  I can't believe I was  allowed to see the  Patriots win.  They won in 99 or 
[02:15:30]  2000.  One of the two.  And they had a great  decade really  competitive.  No, no.  But don't forget we  stunk.  Don't forget that  Boston stunk on  every level.  There's been one like  there was a good  Bruins team, but the  other teams weren't  good.  And the Red Sox  stunk until this  fucking this prodigy  comes in and this  Theo Epstein comes in  and fucking changes  the entire culture.  They had to get a  fucking savant.  Some 10 year old 
[02:16:00]  GM.  They had to experiment  with shit like from  the movies.  That's a movie thing.  He's right.  How old was he?  He's like 20.  He's now a little  older.  He's been around a  while.  He's not old.  Put it this way.  He's still not old  enough to be.  He is because as  as I'm getting  older.  So that means he's  the same exact age  he was.  If I'm 80, he'll  only be 40.  He's a fucking  savant.  He was very young  when he took over.  And he won the  fucking two World  Series, man.  Be happy.  Do you understand  how much how much  this 28 when he was 
[02:16:30]  hired?  Wow.  Do you understand  that?  That's what we  need it.  He's 37 now.  You know what  hiring a 28-year-old  fucking general  manager is?  That's crazy.  That's somebody  went, might as  well.  Fuck it.  We tried  everything else.  Might as well.  Kevin from  Connecticut's on the  line.  He wants to  defend himself.  Kevin, what town  in Connecticut?  We've never asked  you that.  I'm in North  Central, but I'm  originally from  Dorchester, Patrice.  Yeah, but  Savin Hill or  something.  We don't like  each other.  Don't fucking say  we're from the  same places. 
[02:17:00]  You're probably  from fucking  D Street Projects  or something.  White boy couldn't  drive through your  neighborhood.  Go ahead,  Quincy.  If I told you  where I was from,  you wouldn't  believe me.  Go ahead.  Right behind  Dorchester High  School.  Yeah, but you  was there when  what?  You must be  old because you  was there before  the great Negro  migration.  Do you know  there's synagogues  where I live with  fucking weeds and  shit growing because  the Jews just  bounced the fuck  out of there? 
[02:17:30]  Like, I'm trying  to fucking tell  me about Boston.  So you probably  know Kevin White  or something like  that.  When did Whitey  bounce?  What year did  Whitey bounce,  Patrice?  That's actually  my name,  Patrice,  Kevin White,  believe it or  not.  Kevin White,  the fucking,  the,  the,  the,  he was like  the,  who was the  mayor that was  in New York  for years?  The famous  mayor.  Koch.  Yeah,  Koch. 
[02:18:00]  Koch.  He was the,  Kevin White  was the Koch  of fucking  Boston.  He didn't,  you know,  he didn't go  nowhere.  This guy's  older.  Yeah,  yeah.  Connecticut  is telling  his age.  I've been  down here  since 19,  since,  moved out  here in  1990.  So,  I mean,  I grew up  in Boston,  and I'll tell you  something about  Boston sports,  too.  Okay.  The left  Sox are favored  to win the  East.  The Bruins are  doing better  than they've  done in years  and years.  Philadelphia was  just a little  bit more  powerful last  year.  They haven't won  2017.  That's fine.  Oh,  no,  no,  wait a minute,  wait a minute,  Kevin.  Here's my 
[02:18:30]  point.  My point is  not,  you're not,  we're not  disagreeing.  All that  doesn't matter  unless you  got the  championship.  I'm saying  that right  now,  Boston sports  fans are  very,  very,  you know,  we're not  historically  humble.  It's like,  right now,  it's like,  hey,  we've been  winning,  we've been  a winning  sports town  for 10  years.  You know,  not even  including the  Celtics.  don't forget  the Celtics  until they  made,  they just  imported this  team and  we won in  2008 and 
[02:19:00]  we possibly  could have  had one in  2000,  now 2010,  11,  but you  gotta,  don't forget,  we stunk  until 2000,  until we  came back  from a  3-0  deficit  to the  Yankees.  If the  Yankees  could have  fucking won  one game,  we'd still  stink.  And we  had to do  the same  thing with  Cleveland.  The trend  seems to  be that  you buy  these,  you get  these  superstars  and you  win  championships.  The Celtics  did it  in no way.  Red Sox  got two 
[02:19:30]  really great  players to  put,  you know,  everybody,  the East,  matter of fact,  to win the  AL.  Because it  is D.O.  Epstein,  he changed  the idea  of the Red  Sox.  They talk  about the  Yankees-Red  Sox rivalry.  It wasn't  a rivalry  until...  I've never  listened to  the Yankees.  But I'm  saying in  terms of...  Oh, wow,  then you're  not from  Boston.  No, I'm  talking about  in terms of  New England  sports.  If you're  going to be  a fair  person,  you've got  to understand  that the  Patriots,  the Red  Sox, 
[02:20:00]  the Bruins,  and for  22 years,  the Celtics  didn't win.  Why not  go we had  six championships  in the  2000s?  I'm giving  credit for  that.  He said  in the  2000s.  I'm giving  credit for  the 2000s  that we  don't have  tradition yet.  The Steelers  just lost  their first  Super Bowl  yesterday.  They win.  There's a  tradition.  The Lakers  have a  tradition right  now.  They've been 
[02:20:30]  winning since  90...  shit,  95 or  98,  2000.  What's going  on?  Is that  Kevin from  Connecticut?  He look like  a Boston guy  too.  Look at him.  Arch enemies  and shit  from fucking  Boston.  But I'm  not disagreeing  with you,  dude.  I'm telling  you.  It's just  let's be  happy with  and it  goes back  to Danny  Ainge's  fuck-up. 
[02:21:00]  He's  thinking of  the future  but he  shouldn't be.  The future's  right this  second.  We should've  good enough  that we have  these guys  like Theo  Epstein  and Danny  Ainge  and Cam  Neely  doing the  right things  making the  right moves  for the  future.  I think  it is.  I think  if you  got a team  that can  win right  this second  you go  with it  then you  deal with it  because you're  not promised  anything.  Look at the  Miami Heat  they're just  normal.  This team  was supposed  to be  a super  team  but someone  made a point 
[02:21:30]  I think it was  Kevin  Bouchard  he's a  basketball guy  he goes  every single  basketball team  that ever won  was like the  Miami Heat.  they had  three superstars  every team  I heard that  argument the other  day.  Yeah it's like  this is not  new it's like  it's not a new  thing to have  three superstars  because people  want to win  now.  Jordan didn't  win until  eight years  in you think  that was a  plan?  He wanted  to win now  people want  to win a 
[02:22:00]  championship  man and  the Celtics  had a chance  and now they  don't because  they got rid  of their youngest  best defending  big man.  They just  gutted their  team man.  I think it  was a stupid  move but  high size  2020 maybe  Danny Ainge  is a genius  and nobody  knows about  it.  Who the  knows?  Alright.  Oh fuck.  Alright Kev.  Thank you sir.  I'm upset  with this deal  man.  I'm upset 
[02:22:30]  with it man.  I'm not happy  with it man.  I couldn't  believe they  did that.  Not for who  they got.  What did  they do?  What did  they do?  Knicks did  what they  had to do.  I would have  mortgaged the  entire future  to get Carmelo  and what's  his name on  the same team  man.  Amari.  That was a  great move.  I was talking  about the  Knicks trade  with somebody  and they're  saying that  Chauncey doesn't  want to be in  New York.  Is that true?  Chauncey's  whole fee's  from Denver.  His whole  family's in  Denver.  So he's  really bummed  at this trade?  He's not  excited like  Carmelo?  No because  this is business  for Chauncey. 
[02:23:00]  Chauncey's not  all flipped out.  And I'm not  sure if Carmelo's  all that tripped  out.  Why wouldn't  they want to  be in New  York?  Playing at  the Garden.  The guy that  got with the  jersey, his  was missing  out of  basketball right  now.  And I guess  somebody can  say that about  anything.  You know when  you hear people  complain but  the happy to  be there thing  is just  gone.  It's like  you think about  you dream to  play in the  NBA but it's  almost like  some of these 
[02:23:30]  guys are  anointed at  an early age  that they're  going to be  playing in the  NBA.  And that  whole thing  like I don't  want to play  there.  It's like  oh shit.  Now it's like  Carmelo to  me he's a  scoring machine  anyway but I'm  not too sure.  I think he just  wanted to bounce  out of Denver.  And there's a  lot of speculation  that it was  because his wife  didn't like  Denver.  So he's just  like alright  bitch.  She's a big  star too.  She's not a  big star.  She's the MTV  broad.  Okay she's a  big star.  Which one?  La La Vasquez. 
[02:24:00]  She does a lot  of the reunion  shows.  Yeah yeah right.  She's the La La.  Oh god.  La La.  The word is that  she wanted to  move but you  know they got  this coming home  thing but I think  Carmelo's probably  an LA guy you  know and I think  he's a second guy.  I think he's good  here because I  think Carmelo has  the one talent  the number one guy  talent but I think  Amari has a number  one guy attitude.  He's a beast.  And I mean look  man I would have  traded to get him.  And Chauncey's 
[02:24:30]  just going with him.  Chauncey might.  He's older.  He wants to.  He's got a couple  years left in him.  He doesn't want to  shit around.  He wants to  probably be backup  too at this point.  Like he wants to  probably play start  play 20 minutes and  then have another guy  play the rest.  He's just old and  and his family's from  Denver.  He loves Colorado.  He went to Colorado.  He fucking wanted  to get traded to  Denver.  He was very happy  there.  I think he likes  George Carl because  George Carl's an  old time coach who  lets him. 
[02:25:00]  He coaches through  like he's a point  guard that coaches  on the floor.  He's an old school  player but now you  know he's with  D'Antoni.  He doesn't preach  anything.  He runs.  Chauncey's 40.  Then the Nets got  this guy and he's  already saying I  don't want to be  here.  Yeah.  He's holding up  the Nets jersey but  he's saying I don't  know if I want to  be a Nets.  This fucking  gangster Mozgov.  Yeah.  The Russian guy.  He's going to try  to fucking gangster  his way through the  Russian mobster. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  I mean he's a  billionaire.  A billionaire  mobster.  With no personality.  A billionaire  Russian.  Let me not say he's  a mobster but a  billionaire Russian  who lived in  Russia and survived  is some kind of  dangerous guy.  So he's just like  He still lives in  Russia.  He still loves it.  He could be  anywhere.  How do they make  that money?  Come on man.  And he doesn't  He has no  Speculation.  I don't know.  I'm sorry guy.  He has no  personality to it.  He's a weird dude.  He just buys  people.  But this guy's  going to be gone 
[02:26:00]  next year.  He doesn't want  to be there.  He's another one  that gutted his  team.  Basketball's  fucked up.  I don't want to  play here?  Well where do you  want to play  motherfucker?  Yeah.  Really?  Tell us.  What's your dream  team my friend?  These guys are like  but I'm telling  you these old  white dudes man  it's one thing  people don't  that's what  Boston helped  me out with.  We got  we got  we got  we got  Stryker.  He's a Denver  guy.  Colorado guy.  Stryker.  Hey morning boy.  Morning.  Number one  Patrice we need  to get you 
[02:26:30]  back out here  to the comedy  clubs man.  I saw you  once and you  were great.  I'd love to  get you back  out here.  I love that.  I like  Denver  improv man.  Beautiful room.  Have you retired  again?  Where are you at?  You were retired  for three weeks.  I was praying  that elephant in the room  it remains to be seen  it's only a week.  Back into retirement  yeah.  I'm just hoping  it gets me a fan  puts me in a few  movies and  I can't say sir  I like to come back 
[02:27:00]  to Denver.  I had a great time  in Denver though.  I really did.  I was the show  where you were  hitting on that.  You like Colorado  right?  No.  You don't like  Colorado?  I thought you liked  it when you  were out there  and was well.  I hated Colorado.  I thought you liked  it.  I had to go out  there.  No I understand  why you went  but it was  fucking freezing  it sucked.  Didn't we talk  about nothing  to do  the bars  close early.  Didn't you talk  about like the  type of house  you get out  there?  I thought you  kind of  know I was  like yeah  I look at a  lot of shitholes 
[02:27:30]  and think oh  the price of a  house.  I got confused  I thought you  actually liked  it.  I could get  a fucking  a castle in a  lot of those  places but you  know you get  where you pay  for it.  I think that  helped with  Carmelo too  man.  I think a  young soldier  you just wake  up in the  mountains and  it's just like  man.  Yeah yeah.  I love waking  up in the  fucking city  dude.  I just yeah  it's too much  garbage trucks  don't bother me  man.  You just like  no I don't  mind the car  horns and the  sirens and  shit.  But I like  Colorado though. 
[02:28:00]  I enjoy Colorado.  I will say it's  one of my  favorite places  but I don't  know.  I'd like to  check it out  someday.  What do you  got Stryker?  Hey Patrice is  right.  I love Esquad  Velasco  whatever the  hell her  fucking name  is.  She had the  final say on  this whole trade  deal with  Carmelo because  there was talk  to like three  different cities  him going to  and every  time it was  like no no  no the only  one she was  interested in  was coming  back to  New York.  God her  pussy must be  magical.  I don't know.  Why is he  following her 
[02:28:30]  magic pussy.  He's got a  play in the  end.  But she  muscled him  too.  This is  speculation  though.  This is  from black  websites.  It's like  she muscled  him.  She had a  kid and  she's like  I want to  get married.  She didn't  look like  that on  MTV.  She's like  I heard  she run  the show.  I bet  her head  gets going  back and  forth when  she talks  to him.  I ain't  living no  motherfucking.  I mean  she's a star  too.  She wants  to go  out there  and he  probably  just  doesn't  want to  hear  it.  You  know  what  I  mean  he  just  wasn't  because  he  wasn't  married.  They had a 
[02:29:00]  kid together.  She was a  baby's mama  for a while  and then she  put the foot on  his neck and  he's like  okay we'll get  married.  Then they had  a reality show  about her  marriage.  Like preparing  for the wedding  on VH1.  Now they got  another reality show  set up and I  think it was set  up before they  fucking even  came to New  York.  That's the  word.  What Chauncey  is even he  was surprised  when they  started talking  about him  being traded.  He's like  what the fuck?  Chauncey's a  Denver guy.  I had no  idea until 
[02:29:30]  right now.  Chauncey's a  Colorado dude  man.  I had no clue.  He left  Detroit and  got a chance  to come to  Denver.  Now they  got in Denver.  George  Carl's probably  not going to  last long.  He's kind  of sick.  He's probably  getting tired.  He's looking  tired and  he's coaching  all these  fucking gangsters  in Denver.  That's got  to suck for  an old  white coach.  I mean to  coach gangsters  he's coaching  gangsters.  Because we  were joking  yesterday.  George Carl's  been around  since the  poor black  guys.  The ABA man.  Where they 
[02:30:00]  had to wear  their tiny  little white  shorts and  behave and  now they're  all gangstered  up with the  neck tattoos.  George Carl  must be like  what?  Where the  fuck am I?  What's the  white guy's  name?  The Birdman?  He fucking  has the most  egregious  tattoos I've  ever seen.  Which guy  man?  A Birdman.  And I  forget his  name too.  Chris.  Chris.  Chris.  The Birdman  Young.  Dude.  His tattoos  are just.  Let me see. 
[02:30:30]  This guy.  It's just not  right.  No.  No.  No.  Go to the  newest one dude.  What do you  mean the  newest one?  He got one  that's Birdman  Anderson.  His name is  Chris Anderson.  That's what  you got to put.  Mr.  Anderson.  Please just  have patience  to see this  guy's tattoo.  It's Friday.  We don't give a  fuck.  Watch this  guy's tattoo.  His new  tattoo.  He looks  like he  should be  in prison.  Where's  his new  tattoo?  Birdman  Anderson.  It's on  his neck.  He has  a new  tattoo.  It's a  look at 
[02:31:00]  this guy's  tattoo.  No way.  Look at  this shit.  It's a  colorful thing.  It looks  wonderful  though because  it's white  skin.  White skin is  great for  tattoos but  look how dumb  he is.  He made  himself look  like he's  wearing a  turtleneck.  That looks  uncomfortable.  To the  way his  chin.  Right.  It's a  huge tattoo  that says  free.  It looks  like he's  in a  neck brace.  Why the  fuck would  you do  that?  Are we  getting too  old to  understand  this shit?  No. 
[02:31:30]  We have  to be  getting too  old because  the neck  tattoo is  all the  rage.  He really  looks like  he's in  a trauma  collar.  This tells  you no one  thinks about  living to a  certain age.  How the  fuck do  you do  that?  Damn.  It's insane.  And what  does the  other side  say?  He has  free bird  tattooed on  his neck.  And here's  the thing.  Can I say  Chris Anderson  is really 
[02:32:00]  just above  a journeyman  player.  Really?  So it's not  like he's a  super duper  player where  you can fuck  your whole  life up with  tattoos and  you'll be  straight for the  rest of  your life.  He might  have to  actually sell  cars at  some point.  He might  have to  go hello  welcome to  fucking  free bird  coffee shop.  Free bird  motors.  Yeah like  what is wrong  with him?  That's crazy.  I thought it  would be a  little thing.  That's huge.  I'm really  going to put  my neck out  for you.  That's what  he used to  look like?  Selling you this  Toyota.  Before the  neck tattoos? 
[02:32:30]  What the fuck  is that with  it?  He's got wings  on his biceps.  He was a  crazy kid.  And George  Cowell has  just got these  but the  next players he  got Gallinari  looked okay.  Wilson Chandler  looked okay  last night.  And Felton.  They might have  a better team  situation in  Denver now.  Maybe not  the superstar.  But they  looked okay.  They blew  the Celtics  out.  We're going  to take a  little break.  We'll change  gears certainly.  Talk about  other shit.  What happened?  Oh Pat Cooper  is here so we'll  get Pat Cooper 
[02:33:00]  in next.  Turns out  Patrice is a  big fan of  Mr. Cooper.  I love Pat  Cooper with  all my heart.  Good.  We'll end  the show  with him.  We've got  one more hour  to go here.  Pat Cooper  joins us  next.  The virus  Sirius XM.  This is  the O.P.  Anthony Show.  Let's get  Pat Cooper  in here  before he  fucking  loses his  mind.  I hear  he's yelling  and screaming.  Roland was  he yelling 
[02:33:30]  and screaming  down the  hall?  Oh look  very calm.  I know  right?  What the  hell?  Are you  yelling  Pat?  All right  bro.  Sit up  straight.  You're not  going to  come to  my house  and sit  like  Pat.  Sit up  straight.  Good morning  O.P.  Anthony.  How are  you?  Where's  the baby?  Thank you  Pat.  The baby's  fine.  Busted my  balls.  Yeah.  What's  happening?  Were you  yelling  down the  hall?  We got  a full  report. 
[02:34:00]  You were  yelling.  Hiya bro.  Patrice  O'Neal.  Why don't  you try?  Pat Cooper.  Pat's  putting his  headphones  on.  I don't  know.  But this  focaccia  thing is  working.  Will somebody  help this  old man  with the  fucking  headphones  please?  Don't  call them  all.  Jesus.  Anthony  how you  doing?  I'm doing  good.  Thank you  Paisan.  God bless.  Nice.  Thanks for  having me  on because  I know the  ratings were  going down.  Yeah.  That's what  happens.  How the hell  do I know?  What am I  yesterday?  We figured  we'd just  get rid of 
[02:34:30]  OK.  Ready to  broadcast.  Ready for  action Pat  Cooper.  Why are you  looking at  me?  I'm looking  at you because  I can't  believe you  guys are  still here.  I say  that with  love.  I don't  know how  people in  this country  with no  talent get  lucky.  It's  amazing.  What do  they hire  you as  one of  our bosses?  Anthony  you don't  need  anybody.  You  understand?  You're  holding  them up  all these  years.  I know.  What are  you going  to do?  What's  new Pat? 
[02:35:00]  Pat.  What are  you up  to Pat?  Come on.  I am  up to  here and  I got  a call  at 8 o'clock  this morning  to work  a condo.  A condo?  Yes.  I'd rather  work in  Germany  with  Hitler  still  around.  A  fucking  condo.  Who's  going to be  watching?  Now in  2012,  not even  in this  year.  So this  is the  shit that  I'm down  to at  my age.  Can you  explain  the  gig?  I'm  not  talking  to  you  yet.  I'll  let  you  know.  We've  gotten  uppity 
[02:35:30]  over the  years.  I'm  sorry.  Now I  know why  your  friend  North  quit.  I miss  him.  He's a  nice man.  I just  thought  he's  8x10.  It  sucks.  These  guys  think  they're  good  looking.  They  got  the  hair  quaffed  and  everything.  He's  a comic.  Shut  up.  Do  your  comedy.  Forget  about  quaffing.  That's  Patrice  O'Neill.  You did  some time  with him  on Tough  Crowd.  I don't 
[02:36:00]  know who  this  gentleman is.  He  touched  me  one  more  time.  I'm  going to  knock  him  on  his  ass.  I'm  going to  keep  even  with  your  carpet  tunnel,  sir.  I'm  a game  next  martial  arts.  All  right.  Let's  get  some  water  here.  Yeah.  you're  eating  while  I'm  talking.  I'm  a pair  of  balls.  You need  anything?  You need  some water?  I don't  want  nothing but  to get  out of  here  fast.  Why  did  you  move  me  from  eight  to  nine?  What  is  this  shit?  Well, 
[02:36:30]  we  figured  we  could  coast  and  let  you  just  shine.  No,  I  don't  want  to  shine  because  you  knocked  out  my  sleeping  pattern.  Can  you  ask  how  guys  got  famous  back  in  media  and  Twitter  and  emails  and  sending  out  flyer  things  electronic  flyers.  How  do  people  get  famous?  Because  they're  talented.  Oh,  see, 
[02:37:00]  that's  the part  that's  left  down.  Let  me  tell  you  something.  Without  the  electronic  shit,  90%  of  them  wouldn't  get  a  fucking  job.  Right.  And  I'm  telling  you're  one  of  them.  I  know.  Hey,  Pat,  I snuck  in right  under  the  wire.  I  got  right  in  there  when  I  have  to.  I  don't  care  about  yesterday  and  I  don't  care  about  today  because  it's  over.  It's  done  for  who?  It's  done  for  me  and  that's  the  end  of  it  and  this  is  the  last  hurrah.  Well,  if  it's  done  for  you,  how  come  I'm  seeing  stories  about 
[02:37:30]  you?  Well,  because  I  gotta come  here  with  something.  I  can't  come  here  and  hope  to  God  that  you  ad-lib.  That's  a safe  thing  to do.  Why'd  you bring  this  schmuck  along  with you?  I  need  him  because  Jewish  people  in this  business  have  what  you  call  power.  He's  my  only  Jew  that  I  know  with  power.  And  he's  a  good  man  and  he's  a  helpful  man  and  he's  right  there  when  you  need  him  and  he's  a  good  guy  and  listen  I've  had  a  lot  of  managers 
[02:38:00]  a  lot  of  agents  thank  god  he's  not  one  of  them  but  he's  a  good  guy  you  have  been  screwed  over  by  a  manager  or  agent  over  the  years  I  had  I'd  say  about  six  or  seven  managers  and  I  had  about  maybe  200  agents  I  told  you  I  got  called  this  morning  8  o'clock  and  all  she's  going  to  make  is  a  $12  commission  for  2012  that's  when  you  know  the  country  is  fucked  up  I  told  her  I'd  give  her  $20  to  leave  me  alone  and  she  turned  it  down  because  then 
[02:38:30]  I  feel  I'm  not  in  show  business  a  condo  it's  work  it's  1100  seater  it's  like  the  radio  city  music  hall  it's  wonderful  I love  doing  the  condos  they're  nice  people  but  not  8 o'clock  in the  morning  that's  the  third  time  he  interrupted  me  old  man  time  I'm  gonna  hate  black  people  you  go  out  there  and  go  hey 
[02:39:00]  Jim  what's  with  your  fucking  hair  you  see  he  wants  to  be  known  with  a  body  like  that  he  can't  miss  I  can't  believe  he's  doing  fucking  Mr.  Saturday  night  shit  the  man  is  not  in  my  league  does  he  understand  this  make  this  I'm  I'm  hurt  why  are  you  hurt  because  it's  like  Pat  still  he's  not  you  see  he's  fighting  for laughs  this  whole  show  is  a  fucking  laugh  how  the  hell  could  you  fight  for laughs  we gave  up

[02:40:00]  a point that I don't mean  that disrespectful to you  but people say  well you know  I see Pat  you know why  last  there's an  attitude  I say what about  fucking talent  when do I get  fucking  you know  but let's be honest  Pat  there is a little bit  of anger  it's a little bit  I'm gonna move up  the hall  and pay on the people  it's just  Pat  it's a little  anger  and I think  that keeps  it's not  anger  it's called  talent  you sick  fuck  what's the  matter  with you  I think  all the  all the 
[02:40:30]  he's a lonely  fucking man  all the slobber  coming up  the side of your mouth  is not just  talented  that's not  talented  spit  it's a little  bit of his  anger  he's pregnant  toward  Caroline  I am there  March 10th  he's gonna be there  next week  he's gonna be there  soon Pat  so you think  it's all  talent  no attitude  in there to  balance  it's all  in one  first of all  you gotta have  the confidence  in yourself 
[02:41:00]  right  and don't  listen to people  who think  they know  comedy  and don't  belong  and no  disrespect  to this  I tell you  I got  confidence  and if I  didn't have  confidence  I wouldn't  last this  far  and I'm 82  I hope  my buddy  here will  last 82  because it's  not easy  anymore  it really  isn't  no  why is that  because of  the bullshit  no because  well you saw  in today's  paper  Rodriguez  got 6  million  dollar  tax  right off  alright  there are  fucking  poor  people  who can't  eat  and this  fucking  guy's

[02:42:00]  respect  yourself  for  doing  that  man  but  that's  wrong  that's  wrong  why  I'm  telling  you  that's  wrong  any  man  that  hits  a  baseball  or  catches  a  ball  don't  deserve  a  six  million  dollar  write-off  I'll  tell you  who  deserves  it  the  school  teachers  that's  who  fucking  deserves  it  well  that's  a  talent  though  he's  very  talented  he's  not  talented  he's  a  fucking  ball  player  give  what  what  is  wrong  with  you  I'm  disagreeing  with
