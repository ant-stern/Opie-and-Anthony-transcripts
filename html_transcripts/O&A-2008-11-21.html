<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, featuring Patrice O'Neal as guest host alongside Dante Nero and Biz Markie, began with a passionate discussion on hip-hop music and sampling. Patrice, self-proclaimed "President of Racism," vehemently argued against the lack of credit given to original artists whose work was heavily sampled in popular hip-hop songs by artists like Dr. Dre and Puff Daddy.  He played numerous musical samples, comparing the originals (e.g., songs by Leon Haywood and Freddie Scott) to the sampled versions, highlighting what he perceived as the superiority of the original work and questioning the "genius" attributed to the hip-hop producers.  This segment included humorous commentary on sound engineer "Sam's" rhythmic body movements in response to the music, and  Patrice's complaints about his girlfriend's overly affectionate behavior and her daughter's unusual habit of talking to herself.  The discussion also touched upon the role of YouTube in making original songs more accessible.  The segment concluded with a comedic bit suggesting Patrice's takeover of the show during Opie and Anthony's absence, including threatened re-staffing and changes.

The show continued with Patrice O'Neal and Dante Nero, joined by guest J.B. Smoove.  The initial topic was O'Neal's struggles with housebreaking his new poodle, quickly transitioning into darkly humorous and offensive anecdotes about his girlfriend, her daughter, and his past lifestyle. This portion included numerous misogynistic and racist jokes. Listener calls offered conflicting advice on puppy training, ranging from crate training and positive reinforcement to harsher methods. The segment shifted to an "Unsung Sample Hip Hop Day" theme, a game to identify original songs sampled in various hip-hop tracks.  Smoove's extensive hip-hop knowledge was showcased, contrasting with O'Neal's less accurate guesses.  The conversation included Smoove's career, comedic experiences, views on the comedy scene, and his health and diet.  O'Neal's offensive language continued throughout this segment.

J.B. Smoove and Dante then promoted their upcoming comedy shows.  The hosts subsequently discussed Russell Brand's criticism of the Jonas Brothers' promise rings, which led to a conversation about sex education for teens. A large portion involved playing old audio from the show's archives, including a horse diary entry song, a condom superhero song, "Darth Vulgar," "Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre," car commute audio, "Scared Shitless Project" recordings from Harlem, and the "Schlong Song."  Opie and Anthony provided self-deprecating commentary, acknowledging the lowbrow humor, reacting to listener feedback, and playing celebrity voice ID drops from Burt Ward, Chaz Palminteri, and Arsenio Hall. They also discussed past negative publicity and experiences in different radio markets.

Opie recounted his early radio career, focusing on his creation of the character "Spuds Buckley."  Audio clips of Spuds Buckley's quirky and absurd on-air bits were played, along with details about Spuds' unusual attire. Opie shared a humiliating story about a promotional appearance as Spuds, which unexpectedly resulted in a raise.  The conversation covered low-paying jobs, including handing out roses and delivering food.  The hosts then discussed a trip to Doral with Rich Voss, recounting anecdotes involving Voss smoking, breaking his hand, and making out with an elderly albino woman.  Audio clips from Opie and Anthony's first show, described as chaotic and poorly produced, were played, showcasing their early, embarrassing work.  Joe and Anthony from Rotgut were present in the studio during this segment.  Opie also mentioned creating a new bit called "Celebrity Death Watch."

The show concluded with the hosts listening to and reacting to an eight-year-old recording of their broadcast, featuring highly offensive language, a Cuban refugee song parody, and an O.J. Simpson song parody.  The hosts expressed extreme embarrassment and disgust at their younger selves' behavior and language. A running gag involved replacing swear words with "darn."  They struggled to get past a segment featuring George Burns singing "Get the Funk Out," with Opie repeatedly threatening to leave.  Listener calls were interspersed, and Sam Kinison briefly appeared and left the studio.  The segment included further playing of the old broadcast and frequent mentions of Pizza Deluso, along with discussions of past radio experiences.

What up, sir?  What's up, fella?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  And good morning, Biz Markie.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Good morning, Freddie Scott, who I think is dead, actually.  Freddie Scott.  Um, today is, today is what we call unsung sampled.  The unsung sampled heroes of rap, your favorite rap songs, the originators are being, are being loved and honored today.  A.K.A. Patrice is finished with hip-hop.  I'm not sure if I'm finished with hip-hop. 
[00:03:00]  And it's not, it's not, it's not, you, you got what I need.  And you say you're just a friend.  It's you, you got what I need.  You, listen to this, listen everybody.  Don't sing along.  You got everything you need.  You're like medicine to me.  Alright, thanks, Don Brain. 
[00:03:30]  Listen to that.  Brain.  Isn't that beautiful?  That's a beautiful song.  Gorgeous.  And, this is the running theme today.  Is it, is, we're gonna, because, I, I grew up on hip-hop.  I would say about, what, 80?  82?  I mean, I grew up.  I'm not 70, 78, 77.  78?  What are you?  What are you?  Uh, I'm a young man, as you said.  You say 70s to nothing.  What are you talking about?  Ah, well, the first, the first, the first, the first hip-hop record, uh, King Tim III with 
[00:04:00]  the Fatback Man.  Uh, King Tim III with the Fatback Man.  Me, the Fatback Man.  I have that on my iPod, but we can't.  Yeah.  Anyway, um, so what I was, what happened is, I don't know what I got into, but the first  time I ever actually was, uh, upset with hip-hop was the day, it was a song by War.  Remember that war, that song, Slippin' Into Darkness? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, Slippin' Into Darkness.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,  so I heard, it used to be a group, it was a group called Poor Righteous Teachers, it was  like, um, rock this funky joint.  Yeah.  And, and I was like, I was like, first time I heard War, I had heard Slippin' Into Darkness.  No, I heard, I heard Poor Righteous Teachers first.  Right.  So when I heard War, I was like, who's these sons of bitches stealing from Poor Righteous  State? 
[00:05:00]  It was, it was disgusting.  So that was the first taste I ever got of that.  So what happened is, um, this is where I got angry.  First of all, I'm a staunch defender now of Puff Daddy.  Right.  Because for some reason, Puff is the supposed, he's the evil, evil sampler, Sith Lord of  sampling.  Right.  Sampling, he just, oh.  He just screwed it up for everybody.  He's the evil sampler.  Right.  So, ultimately, I'm listening to a song, um, can you cue up, um, Leon Haywood, please? 
[00:05:30]  That's what he had over there, isn't it?  No, I don't know, but Lee, no, that was Freddie Scott, Mr. White Man.  It's coming.  We got, we got a phone real time, so they're coming.  Okay.  But Leon Haywood, I didn't realize there's, there's a great hip hop song, um, that Dr.  Dre did.  Um, one, two, G-Thing.  One of the classic all-time hip hop songs. 
[00:06:00]  And universally, uh, you know, popular.  Everybody knows.  Yeah, everybody knows.  So, you know, I'm sitting there listening to it, and Leon Haywood comes on.  Um, I had, I picked up this thing called Pimp's Up, Holds Down, Outtakes.  And, uh, it was like a, a sidebar of, like, behind the scenes stuff that you didn't see  on the original Pimp's Up, Holds Down.  Or not Pimp's Up, Holds Down, American Pimp.  Um, and they, to kind of make up for the fact that it's a terrible DVD, they give you  this, the soundtrack. 
[00:06:30]  The soundtrack.  And, and on the soundtrack is Leon Haywood, um, uh, uh, uh, I want to do something freaky  to you.  Yeah.  And it, it is absolutely, it's not sampled.  It's, I want to know what makes a super producer.  Now, I'm not dissing hip hop, but I still, it has a place in my heart.  Right.  But, but Leon Haywood, that song, and when we get it, we'll play it.  It is absolutely the song.  This exact song. 
[00:07:00]  It's not.  Almost like they don't, they don't sample it at all.  It's not.  And I know people go, wait, man, what, you know, white people, man, they stole rock and  wall for black people, son.  I, I, I get it.  But we know Big Mama Thornton's saying, you ain't nothing but a hound dog.  But, but Elvis stole it, but Elvis did up.  Made it better.  He made it better.  So I'm saying, what makes Puffy evil and Dr. Dre a genius when Leon Haywood, that song, 
[00:07:30]  I want to do something for you, is the song.  Yeah.  It's the song.  So I got so obsessed with it, dude, that I don't know if I'm going to listen to rap no  more, but I guess maybe I should, I should, here's what my girl said.  My girl's like, look, you would have never heard of Hossam Ramsey if it wasn't for Jay-Z.  Right.  And I don't know if I would have cared.  Probably not.  And maybe you're right.  And ultimately, I guess I have to blame or give YouTube credits. 
[00:08:00]  Because God bless YouTube.  Right.  Because you just typing something.  And it's like, wait a minute.  So I guess the fact that guys that had to dig into crates, find these songs, put it on  something and, and do it is, is, is amazing.  But I am a big fan now of the unsung samples, the, the people with that, like, you got what  I need.  That song, you should know before you know Biz Markie's song. 
[00:08:30]  There's no way you should be surprised when you hear that song.  Where did the sample come from?  And I blame myself.  I blame myself.  Well, you know, it's almost a progressive thing though.  It's like, as you were exposed to these things, and then, and we had talked about this, that  we started looking into more of these samples deeper and deeper and exposing ourselves into  other music.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Listen again.  You got what I need.  You got everything you need. 
[00:09:00]  You're like medicine to me.  How dare.  It's a better song.  How dare I not know this man?  How dare I sing Biz Markie.  Over this.  And not sing this first.  How dare me.  How dare me.  Not how dare you.  Not how dare anybody else on planet Earth.  But how dare me not know who Freddie Scott is.  I was looking for a reason to not stop listening to hip hop. 
[00:09:30]  Ultimately, the only thing I could come up with that people convinced me is that without  hip hop, I would have never known Freddie Scott, which is a fair point.  It's fair.  But I was two inches from denouncing hip hop because there's not a song that's not just.  And this is clearly a better song.  It's more melodic. 
[00:10:00]  It's hot.  It makes you emotional.  So why did he go, just a friend?  Like, it just.  And just listen to this, man.  How can you.  I swear to God, no one would be upset about the black president.  If they were playing this.  If this was our music, no one would go, Obama, nah. 
[00:10:30]  No one would do that.  People would just be like, wow.  There's no racism to this.  Matter of fact, I'm going to prove to you there's no racism to this.  I need Joe Cocker, woman to woman.  There's a white dude.  I got to have it.  I got to have it when the show goes on.  Just to let you know that Patrice O'Neal.  This is about good music.  The president of racism. 
[00:11:00]  California.  Tupac and California.  Oh, wait a minute.  Don't even tell people that yet.  Don't even tell people that yet.  Listen to this.  Tupac and everybody was naked in the desert in the video.  The Thunderdome.  Chris Tucker was like, can you dig it?  This is the same guy. 
[00:11:30]  Hold on.  Stop this for a second.  This is the same man that sung.  Lord, lift us up where we belong.  You can leave your hat on.  Where the eagles fly.  On the mountain high.  Lord, lift.  Where we belong.  Play that again.  Just to let you know I'm not being a racist scumbag. 
[00:12:00]  The president of racism gives credit where credit is due.  Now, we're...  This is a very popular...  Please, don't get me wrong.  I am not attacking hip-hop, but why...  Tell me why Dr. Dre is a genius.  For this song.  And this is the whole song.  It's not a different...  This is not even a sample. 
[00:12:30]  It sounds like the same...  I think in the song, Roger Troutman had that thing in his mouth that went...  That everybody's doing now.  T-Pain and everybody's using that now.  Look at the black side of Sam moving.  You can't help it, can you, Sam?  One of his hands are popping.  He's popping one hand.  He don't know what he's doing.  One hand is still and the other one's tapping his foot. 
[00:13:00]  His hips and his little bird chest.  He's just moving.  He don't know why.  All right, Danny.  That is hot.  I just want to let you guys know, today is, throughout the day, unsung sample day.  Just to let you know that something that I, who am a card-carrying hip-hop fan.  Right.  Card-carrying.  Defend hip-hop to the injury. 
[00:13:30]  Not to the death.  I defend hip-hop to...  To the injury?  To the DL.  To the punch in the ribcage.  Non-lethal wound.  Before, though, I would defend hip-hop to the death.  Right.  I just want to make sure people know, dude, that this is where it came from.  Matter of fact, I don't even think I want to sample any James Brown.  Right.  But quite frankly, I was Googling, because I was just obsessed with this.  Right, right.  James Brown is responsible for hip-hop. 
[00:14:00]  In its entirety.  Responsible for hip-hop.  Not even...  Without him, I don't know if hip-hop would exist.  No.  As we know it today.  I think there's 20,000 downloaded songs.  I think James Brown, they said, was sampled 900 times.  Wow.  Something ridiculous.  Nine...  And I could be wrong about this, but I'm close.  I know I'm close.  He was paid...  He was paid something like $40 million based on the future sampling of his music. 
[00:14:30]  Wow.  Just for the fact that so many people sample him, we don't have time to go and get this.  We're going to pay him ahead of time for the fact that we're going to use his music.  Wow.  And his babies, and when I say his babies, the people that he put out there in music,  their music was sampled the second most. 
[00:15:00]  He's almost sly and...  Lynn Collins, Mandrill, the J.B.'s...  Wait a second.  Stop the presses.  We can't even go on now.  Type in the J.B.'s grunt.  Let me tell you something about the J.B.'s grunt that had a tear coming down my eye.  I was in a diner after I did a show, me and my girl sitting there,  and I heard Night of the Living Bass Heads.  And I said, wow, what's this? 
[00:15:30]  He said, oh, this is the J.B.'s.  The DJ was like, this is the J.B.'s.  I said, can you play that again, please?  And he played it.  That song, J.B.'s The Grunt, is the entire album of Nation of Millions.  My third rated hip-hop album of all time, number one is Run-D.M.C.'s first album.  Number two is N.W.A.'s first album.  Number three is that, is Nation of Millions. 
[00:16:00]  That song has at least five songs from the album on the song.  Just that song.  It was shocking to me.  Because I gave P.E. credit for my life.  I think I was going to kill myself one time, and I heard P.E.  And not past the P's, it's called The Grunt. 
[00:16:30]  Is it there?  You got it?  No, I don't.  I have the P's, and I passed the P's and sold out.  Find The Grunt, you mother-effer.  I'm sorry, Danny.  You must find The Grunt.  If you don't find The Grunt, we can't go on.  The Grunt is important.  We'll look during the break.  We don't want to lose Danny.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  People.  Oh, wow.  Listen to this.  Wow.  Listen to the horn.  The horn.  That's a whole horn section.  Listen to all the police that you, listen, all the police driving around today listen 
[00:17:00]  to this.  You can't pull a black man over for nothing after you listen.  Listen to this song.  Just let him go.  Wow.  He didn't kill nobody.  He just doesn't have insurance.  I didn't even know this one.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This is James Brown's babies.  Hold on.  I want you to hear the Night of the Living bass heads part.  I want you to hear it.  We can't go on without it. 
[00:17:30]  Hold on.  Wow.  Listen.  Listen, Danny.  Danny didn't know this.  That's fight the power, right?  Music will bring us together.  This is what's going to end racing, I think.  Ready?  Oh, man.  Here it is.  Bass.  You hear that stuff, Ray?  You didn't even know you had hips, did you? 
[00:18:00]  Look at him.  Pull over, officer.  Just let him go.  Just let that N-word go.  He's going to work so he can afford insurance.  Just let him go.  Hey, garbage truck, pull over a little bit so I can get by you.  Just a little bit.  You can't park a little bit.  It's 5 in the morning. 
[00:18:30]  You have to block the whole street.  And could you please pick up, just take part of the crib that I left.  I know it's not bulk garbage day.  Could you put that in there, please?  Is it possible?  Oh, God.  Huh?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  What?  Are you serious?  What?  This is, this is...  Dude, how can I... 
[00:19:00]  I'm at a dilemma, Stump Brain.  Hold on.  Start that from a dandy.  Thanks for finding that so fast.  How...  How...  What am I to do?  What am I to do?  My dilemma.  Please explain to me, what do I do to continue to go, I love...  Hip-Hop.  Hip-Hop.  When I love this song.  Now, just not...  Just tell me why I still need Hip-Hop if I got YouTube and The Grunt. 
[00:19:30]  Please.  I'm telling you, please.  I'm gonna blast this in my truck.  I'm blasting JB's The Grunt in my truck.  I love P.E.  They got me through a certain time in my life.  If...  But I don't even know if I'd ever listen to the song.  If...  Did you hear that song?  It's awesome, man.  Awesome.  It's...  It's Don't Believe the Hype.  It's Terminator X Speaks with His Hands.  It's...  It's...  It's...  Uh...  Bass Heads. 
[00:20:00]  It's...  All in...  All in one song.  Dude.  Well, this goes to what you were talking about yesterday, that we don't know history.  We don't have any history in this country.  And it's my fault, Stump Brain.  Well, it's...  No, it's all of ours.  It's my fault.  And you're bringing people some knowledge on this.  And why can't...  You know, things are updated all the time.  Movies, TV shows, books get updated.  So, you can have the original, and you can still have something new.  Every now and then, you stumble into something that might be better.  I...  Yeah, but...  Not really.  Here's my issue.  It's not better. 
[00:20:30]  My issue is...  I don't mind being influenced by things.  I mean, influence is different than...  Taking.  Yeah, you were saying that you thought these producers were getting too much credit.  I don't...  I don't know why.  Just tell me why.  That's...  Just tell me why Dr. Dre is considered a genius in terms of producer.  And again, don't get me wrong.  The dude... 
[00:21:00]  He's earned something.  You know, I'm just saying in my...  It's just like if I take Richard Pryor, George Conn, and I just start doing their jokes  a little better, but for a new generation.  So, I do...  I do...  There are some comics who actually do that, by the way.  I do, you know, Mudbone, but I do it...  A little different.  Different for the kids.  A little hip-hop in it.  And...  Should I? 
[00:21:30]  But you don't know till you know.  Like, I know...  You don't know till you know, and now that you know...  Tell me why.  Tell me why.  We wouldn't be right now playing these songs.  I agree.  We just wouldn't.  And that argument is the only thing that I am hinging my last bit of hip-hop love is  that I would have never heard of the grunt if it wasn't for the Nation of Millions. 
[00:22:00]  And trust me, I am no homo in love with P.E.  I love Chuck.  I love Flav.  People talk about Flavor now.  I think he deserves anything he needs.  If Flav wants to be 50 and kiss young girls in the mouth and run around crazy, he deserves  it for what he did for people.  He deserves it.  He's a middle-aged man, and he's 50-something, so he's black, so he's not a middle-aged man.  He's a senior citizen.  He's almost dead.  Because I'm 30 years old. 
[00:22:30]  I'm 38 years old, and if you do the black-to-white life ratio, I'm a 116-year-old white man.  Do you understand?  Man, I'm saying to you, I need to know why I should ever listen to that again.  I was watching a documentary with DJ Premier, super producer DJ Premier, and they were talking  about when they were doing these samples.  And they would, this guy, he was in an old record store, just with eight-foot piles of 
[00:23:00]  records.  And he was just digging through these records, dusty records in the basement, trying to find  a track.  So, I mean, now when you're looking at it now-  So you're saying, okay, the fact is, my laziness is what makes me not a super producer.  Yeah, I guess so.  So, that's fair enough, but here's the number, y'all.  Call in 877-212-6263, 877-212-O-N-D-A. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, and read the regular number, because most people got a cell phone.  There's no letters on it.  Okay, it's 877-212-6263.  Call in.  And there's a lot of calls right now.  Can we have time to take calls?  We should take a break.  We should take a break.  All right, listen, we're going to get to your calls, because already, it's already a bunch  of people on the line, dude, even without the number.  Right, right.  I don't even know why I started out with this, but the grunt- 
[00:24:00]  The grunt is awesome.  Makes me feel better about my diabetes.  I feel like I can have a cake.  I feel healed from diabetes, man.  Hey, we'll be back.  O&A, man.  Come on, stop breaking.  Yeah.  Hi, Opie here from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Patrice O'Neal doing our show today.  Listen to him make the same point over and over and over and over. 
[00:24:30]  That's really just so people understand.  That's so people get the drift.  Start that over again.  That's sexy.  Just real sexy.  The rap song attached to this, by the way.  Start that over.  I have to nail the point in, because people don't listen.  This is short attention span, baby. 
[00:25:00]  This is the land of the internet.  I have to say it again and again.  Listen to Quincy Jones, Summer in the City.  Listen to this.  Classic hip-hop song by, like, one of the, kind of a fusion hip-hop group, the Farside.  Well-loved group.  Yeah.  But why do I need them?  Why do I need to say Farside again when I have Quincy Jones and I have this?  Listen, this is a, listen.  Listen, officer.  I know I ran six red lights, but you know, anticipation is part of this driving thing. 
[00:25:30]  Let's be honest here.  Yeah, look at the big picture.  Let's be honest here.  Listen, I know I didn't take a shower yet, sweetie, but you smelt me this way before.  Let me get a little piece before I have to go deal with the man.  Come on, man.  Just kiss, just kiss it a little bit before I gotta go deal with this boss of mine.  I'm like a little meat with seasoning.  Come on, you stink.  You don't think you stink from time to time? 
[00:26:00]  I gotta see you when it looks like Kevin Bacon's neck from Friday the 13th.  Look at, look at Sam.  Got Sam.  Sam.  If anybody don't know, Sam has chosen a side, says President of Racism.  Sam is now black.  No more than he's teasing things.  Look at, and he's disappointed, too, because he can't even help it.  He's hurt.  It's disease.  Sam is diseased with rhythm.  You don't have a choice.  I can't.  Sammy, where are you? 
[00:26:30]  Over here.  Which one?  We're right here now.  I'm over here.  I don't have a choice?  What do you mean?  When that music comes on, you don't have a choice.  You know what you are.  Dude.  Dude.  Everybody.  We need to talk to your mom and dad and break the news.  And we need to have Maury Povich here.  That's fantastic.  So when your mother runs in the back, pretending she didn't know, crying.  Falls down.  Don't worry.  I'm a dude.  Wait.  Play that song one more time.  Wait a minute.  No.  Play the grunt one more time, Danny.  When Sam's father finds out. 
[00:27:00]  You are not the father.  I don't know about all that.  Sam, there's no way, if your parents are white, that you are both their sons.  It could have been somebody farther back mixing a little notch.  Not even on that whole Thomas, what is it?  Edison?  Jefferson.  Who's his dad?  Jefferson.  That Thomas Jefferson.  No.  It's just not.  Look at the way he moved. 
[00:27:30]  Did you see the way Sam?  Can you play that one more time, please?  You want this one or you want the other ground?  I want the smooth one again.  Quincy.  It's sexy.  People don't understand.  It's in your bones, in the marrow.  Look at Sam.  And I'm not lying to you.  There's a difference when white people are good at emulating rhythm and when it's really in your pores.  It's in the marrow.  Sam.  Dude.  Sam has the proper droop.  He got the Cheshire smile.  The Cheshire cat smile. 
[00:28:00]  And his hips is going.  Sam.  Dude.  It's in the music.  I'll be with you when you tell your father.  You are not the father.  Sam Jackson is your dad.  I'm going to take a first call.  Andrea.  Andrea, how are you?  I'm good.  You need to calm down, though. 
[00:28:30]  It's okay.  It's okay.  There's nothing original in the entire world.  There's nothing original here.  I, I, well, that's not true because somebody had to invent it.  What do you think that song is from the Bible?  Like, what do you, what I'm saying is, I mean, anything that's been invented was invented from something else.  There is nothing original.  It's been step by step.  Let me tell you something, Andrea.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  You cannot trace what we just heard just now, the smoothness of that, where that came from. 
[00:29:00]  You can't trace that back nowhere.  What I'm saying about the hip-hop thing is like, okay, I know people are like, oh, white people stole blues from blah, blah, blah.  I know that.  I understand that, and I'm a, I'm a card carrier because, you know, I'm president of racism.  Absolutely.  I'm a card carrier, a card-carrying hip-hop fan.  I mean, for my whole life.  I grew up with it.  I'm saying that when Elvis stole, he stole the, the concept and everything else, but he did make it into his thing. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  And, and I don't, look, stealing, stealing, but he did at least take it and make it and get an influence.  This song.  So are you saying, are you saying that's more honorable, more respectable than taking something and still giving that person credit instead of taking it and saying, no, no, no.  I came up with this on my own.  Put it this way.  So this, so when Dr. Dre sits down and he takes samples from everyone under the sun. 
[00:30:00]  She's starting to not believe it.  And he puts it together in this new way.  It becomes something.  No, no, no, no.  Here's my problem.  It's not.  Did you, did you just hear Joe Cocker?  Song, Woman to Woman?  What?  Did you, did you, you know what rap song that is, right?  Play that Woman to Woman again, Danny.  I think the difference, Andrea, is that it is straight jacked.  It's not sample.  It's just, he should have had a pistol. 
[00:30:30]  Listen to this song.  Just listen to it while you're being somebody from New Jersey.  You can sing the, the California lyrics to this.  You can sing.  Come on, Andrea.  Come on.  Come on.  Move those little skinny white girl hips.  Come on.  You hear that?  I'm not skinny white girls, but my hips ain't skinny.  Let me tell you something.  Let me, thanks, thanks, thanks for the call, sweetie.  Listen, listen to me.  This is the song.  In its entirety.  I don't, this is what I'm asking you.  I don't, I understand things are stolen and things, but this is the song. 
[00:31:00]  And what I'm saying, this is my own disappointment to this, is that I enjoyed California Love before I enjoyed this.  It's, it's unfair for me to enjoy anything besides this first, and then I go, oh, wow, woman to woman, he took it and hip-hopped it up.  All right, I'll go with that.  I'll go with that.  All right.  Jay from Yonkers. 
[00:31:30]  Jay?  Oh, jeez, what's up?  How are you, sir?  What's up?  I'm fine.  Yo, I love you this morning, man.  You have just, yo, you've uncovered a phenomenon.  Like, if you're not in this, you don't know what this is, and right now you're bringing it to everybody.  You know, you've uncovered a phenomenon called digging, you know.  Dre and any other producer who's trying to do it, you got to do your homework.  You got to dig.  Digging into crates.  And look, I will, I will, hold on, Jay.  I will say this. 
[00:32:00]  Again, the two, the two nuts and bolts that are keeping me attached is one that this is YouTube generation where I had just,  have access to woman to woman, and then I can judge, okay?  Okay.  And secondly, wait a minute, is that without digging, I would not even know that this existed.  So I'm saying.  That's why I say it's a, you got to be in it to know it's because as a producer, when you're digging, all right, 
[00:32:30]  like you may look, you may look at a Dre record and you look and you see where the sample comes from and you listen,  you're like, wow.  And like, only good producers will listen to that entire record, you know,  and see what else they could get from it.  But before you even go there, you got to understand the time and the era of hip hop.  Okay.  You know, that when all that music, if you think about classic albums from that era.  Wait a minute, wait a minute, Jay.  You sound like you're a DJ.  No, I'm, that's why I'm loving it.  Oh, you produce?  Yeah.  Yeah, I produce.  Okay, all right. 
[00:33:00]  So as a producer, I'm going to ask you a producer question.  Why is Puffy the, the, the Darth Vader and Dr. Dre is Obi-Wan when it comes to producing?  Why is Puff the cornball?  Oh, Jesus.  Puff is a thief.  And Dr. Dre is a genius.  Oh, Hank Shockley is a genius.  I'm going to tell you about the genius in it with them.  Okay, now, take for example, now, back in the days, before I knew how to play instruments 
[00:33:30]  or anything, I just, all I had was the records.  Okay.  And there was a beat machine called, it was the SP-1200.  All right.  We got, we can't get, we got to know, listen, man, Jay, what is, this is my question.  Because my thing is.  I'm about to tell you what the genius of them is.  Okay.  The genius of them is, is that they make, they take those samples and they make it appeal  to the masses.  That's the genius of them.  No, it does not.  Are you out of your mind, Jay? 
[00:34:00]  No, no, I'm telling you.  Because listen, listen, listen.  So you can give, you can give the same sample to 12 different producers and 9 out of 12 of  them.  Not with the songs I played today.  Look.  No.  Woman to Woman just now.  Woman to Woman is straight.  That is California love.  It is straight.  There is no, let me tell you the closest in my, thanks for calling, dude.  In my estimation, in my estimation or my research, my little research that I've been doing, the 
[00:34:30]  RZA is the, is the only one that takes it and does something else with it.  Now there's probably some songs that did that and this, that and the third, but the RZA  from Wu-Tang takes something and turns it into something like, that's creative.  Right, right, right.  Because I've been, I've been chasing them down.  They, they sample some stuff and they take it and they do it.  Doing something, other stuff, mixing other samples with it. 
[00:35:00]  But California love is straight jacked.  Ah.  Pistol, pistol thievery.  Patrick.  Is he there?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, what's up, Patrice?  How are you?  Nah, I just, I got a real big problem with, you know, these people calling up saying that,  you know, sampling is, it's all about appealing to the masses.  Because I go to school for, you know, music theory, music composition and things.  I write my own, you know, orchestrations, mainly on the guitar, because that's a more 
[00:35:30]  popular instrument these days.  But things like sampling and hip-hop and everything, all of it is garbage, no matter, you know, what,  you're taking someone else's ideas.  And it's like, I remember a couple years ago, Joe Rogan was on the show.  He was talking about how Carlos Mencia and Dane Cook were ripping bits off him, where it  was the same bit, you know, if Rogan did a joke about going to the zoo.  So you're putting, you're putting, you're just saying any, but what about, okay, what  about the idea that Elvis Presley stole from, from blues and, and, and old blues singers 
[00:36:00]  and old R&B people?  Um, and I'm not giving him credit, but I'm saying if you're going to do something, if  that is the, look, hip-hop is based on rap, you know, poetic, so you don't have to be  a musician, but I'm saying that why, why is that considered being genius?  And also, this is the question of the year.  Why is Puffy the guy who gets jerked as the, as the hack producer and Dr. Dre is a genius? 
[00:36:30]  Well, I, I, I, you know, I'm a car carrying hip-hop dude, and I never heard the grunt, you  know what I'm saying?  Dude.  So maybe, and which one would you rather listen to?  The grunt, but the, but the point is, the, the samples that, that, uh, uh, Dr. Dre used  was samples that, no, he just dug in the crates deeper.  It just, I, that's the only thing I can see, I, he's a deeper digger. 
[00:37:00]  He's a deeper digger, you deep digger, you, you diggin' dig, you deep digger.  Hey, hey, uh, Tim, New Jersey, what's up, man?  What's happening?  Will Smith has to be the biggest offender of this.  I mean, but his latest stuff was all stolen, man.  Some of, some of the time.  Yeah, some of the time was straight, that was straight jack.  You should be with it, man.  That was all stolen. 
[00:37:30]  I used to work in a warehouse, and that, like, the original tune came on, but I thought it  was Will Smith.  No, it's not Will Smith.  I mean, it was incredible how much he stole, Wild Wild West, and everything, man.  Yeah, man, thanks, man.  The, the, the thing, the thing that, that, that trips me out is for me, I'm just trying  to get it clear.  I love it.  I'm just saying, please tell me what, it, why should I not ever, why should I  not listen to, play, all right, ready?  We, we on the Dr. Dre thing. 
[00:38:00]  Play, play, uh, uh, Leon Hayward, please.  Hang on.  Just please play that.  No problem.  This one, this one shocked me, and I, I just didn't even know it, and I should be ashamed  of myself.  I should be ashamed.  Mm.  Triple platinum this album went.  Triple platinum.  I should be ashamed.  Yeah.  Please tell me where the, where the, where, what the, they, where he didn't use the sample  as an element to create something new. 
[00:38:30]  This is the whole song.  Just listen.  Even that, that's in there.  We just gotta get to this part.  All right, man.  All right.  Just turn that off.  They don't deserve more. 
[00:39:00]  Too much.  They don't deserve anymore, man.  They don't deserve anymore.  Oh, man.  Dude.  Tom from Westbury.  Isn't anybody on hip hop side?  Let me see.  Yo, Patrice, what's going on, man?  How are you, sir?  Yo, I just want to say, bro, I feel so stupid right now.  I'm going to tell you the truth.  I never, I never, I never even heard that Joe Cocker song.  Right.  And I hate, I hated Tupac.  I never liked Tupac. 
[00:39:30]  And when California Love came out, I was like, yo, he just robbed EPMD.  Because EPMD.  See what I'm saying?  See what I'm saying?  I, I, I can't even be mad at you because I did that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of Rocky's Funky Jones.  Poor Righteous Teachers.  This was a very, I said, how dare they, how dare this group war steal from the great  PRT?  Don't feel bad, dude.  Don't feel bad.  I'm going to tell you that, that Joe Cocker song you just played is hot.  I want that.  Woman to woman. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And when we get to Gary Wright, matter of fact, here's a Jay-Z all-timer.  You got, you got a five to one available?  Just like I said, I got to get, I got to, this is going to blow somebody's mind.  I got to get white.  This is going to straight blow somebody's mind.  Hey, thanks for calling, dude.  You got to post these on the website too.  I don't know.  You find them yourself.  I have to.  I refuse.  You do your own journey.  Look at Sam.  Look at Sam. 
[00:40:30]  Big mouth opening up.  Oh my God.  I did the same thing, Sam.  Wow.  We're going to get to the Jay-Z part that everybody's going to know in a second.  No one here gets out alive now.  It's crazy.  And it's hotter.  Listen, ready?  Ready? 
[00:41:00]  Remember that?  Remember that, Brooklyn?  When you shot that dude?  Remember when you shot that dude that was talking, that was trying to get your girl at the club, son?  On Pickin' Avenue.  Remember that, kid?  What that dude say?  Hey, yo, turn that up.  We about to blow his head off, son.  What?  Turn that Jay-Z up.  You was turning on the doors.  Listen, listen.  Listen.  Is that crazy? 
[00:41:30]  Ready?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look.  Turn that up.  Turn that up.  There you go.  What do you say, yo?  Hey, yo, kid.  Dude's got bodies.  Hey, yo, let's wrangle, son.  People got bodies on the doors.  People got bodies.  You stabbed that dude in the hallway, son.  He's leaking.  To the doors.  You kept it real.  To Jim Morrison. 
[00:42:00]  Representing.  You shot that dude, man.  Go apologize, man, because you shot him.  Because this song hyped you up.  Hey, yo, you ready?  You ready?  Yo, turn that.  Turn that Jay-Z up, son.  Turn that up, man.  Get you hyped up, yo.  You getting ready to body this kid.  Yo, take some of this, kid.  Take some of that.  Hit that.  Hit that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jay-Z, he knows how I'm feeling.  Son.  He feels me.  Son, I get crazy when I listen to the doors. 
[00:42:30]  I'm about to hit this dude in his face, yo.  I get crazy.  You what?  What'd he do to you?  What'd he do to you?  Yo, he stepped on my sneakers, man.  I just bought him.  My Jordan.  He's out of here.  Uh-oh, wait a minute.  Y'all ready?  Ready?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Build it up.  Hold on.  Look at Sam's goofy face.  He's been enlightening, you little worm.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Look at Sam.  Ready?  Ready? 
[00:43:00]  This is the big part.  This is the part.  Crazy.  Son, I get crazy to the doors.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  I'm going to wet everybody.  Wet the whole club to the doors.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Who?  What'd he say?  Son, son.  Son, son.  Son, mark that kid, son. 
[00:43:30]  Hold on.  This just in.  This just in.  We got to go to break, but we got a little primetime gossip from the new enlightened Negro Sam.  Negro.  We're back, and primetime gossip is exploding with breaking Opie and Anthony news.  ONA show hosts, Opie and Anthony, have abandoned ship.  They've decided to take an early vacation and leave everyone's favorite token black friend, Patrice O'Neal, with the reins of the show.  I almost think it's a setup. 
[00:44:00]  I don't trust it.  However, what started off as a happy-go-lucky experiment has quickly become a hostile takeover.  Upon sitting down in the studio, Patrice immediately became drunk with power, threatening the staff of the ONA show.  I'd like to thank sickly little Anthony and, um, in love, Opie, for letting me do this and abuse his staff.  I might have to actually whip these guys into shape.  Within ten minutes, Patrice started restaffing and saying goodbye to many of the show regulars, claiming that there were too many white faces around him. 
[00:44:30]  Patrice's reign of power is seemingly unstoppable.  However, if there is any good news to come of this, at least Patrice is breaking some of those ugly black stereotypes.  There's gonna be strippers and pit bull fighting in this place before you know it.  How has Patrice managed to pirate the Opie and Anthony show? 
[00:45:00]  Will ONA get it back?  And who will survive?  Stay tuned as PTG keeps you informed on one of the most dangerous situations in radio history.  Hey, it's Anthony of the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh, you're listening to a big racist, Patrice O'Neill.  Oh.  I thought you were the big racist. 
[00:45:30]  No, no.  Patrice O'Neill.  Uh.  Dix-a-n-a-day.  That's all you get, fatso.  Not even that insult by Opie bothers me with this song.  Say what you want about my mama.  Talk about my mama with this song.  Ladies playing.  What's up, man?  Welcome back to Opie and Anthony.  Patrice O'Neill guest hosting with, uh, with the lovely Dante Nero on my side there. 
[00:46:00]  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for joining us.  Um, today is unsung hip-hop sample day.  These are people that, um, you heard of the rap song, but you might not have heard of the actual song.  And, uh, welcome back.  Welcome back.  Thank you, Danny.  Uh, let me, let me plug Norton tonight.  Uh, Norty, the young Jim Norton, is going to be performing at 7 p.m.  at Caesars Palace in the Augustus Ballroom, and that's in, at the, uh, Comedy Festival in Las Vegas.

It's, uh, 85 East 4th Street in Manhattan. 
[00:47:30]  That's the Eastville Comedy Club, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, boy.  I don't know how I move on from this.  I could just...  We'll just play a little couple of samples here and there.  Right now, from now, we'll just, we'll just slip it in there and look, it'll be up to you.  Matter of fact, we won't even say the song no more.  You'll find out what it is.  Oh, man.  I had a good night's sleep last night and I'm feeling good.  I actually slept.  Really?  Um, I usually don't sleep.  Um, I slept over my girl's house the other day and I've realized what keeps me up at night  when I sleep over at her house. 
[00:48:00]  What's that?  Her love.  It's just an annoyance.  My, her love just keeps me awake.  Her love for me.  You know, cause I gotta, I gotta pee like an old man, you know.  Even my prostate's swollen or, you know, diabetes makes me go to the bathroom every five seconds.  And anytime I move, she goes, are you okay?  You're okay.  Are you alright?  Honey?  You okay?  You need anything?  You need anything?  You need anything?  She goes, runs the bathroom.  She goes, flush the toilet. 
[00:48:30]  I gotta pee.  Like, my girl just...  Does she shake for you too?  Or no?  Does she shake?  She just loves me.  And I'm not against that.  But I don't think she loves me.  I think she loves...  She loves loving.  She loves love.  She hasn't been in love her life.  She has a kid that she loves.  Now a new puppy that she loves.  And a man that she loves.  And she's always been this, just this selfish bitch.  Just all about her. 
[00:49:00]  Just, just, just, it's me, me, me, and more me.  And now she just, I realize, sweetie, don't get me wrong.  Sometimes I like you there.  But just, I realize why I wasn't sleeping.  I slept good last night.  You know why?  No love.  She didn't go, you gotta get up at four.  What, this is her voice I use for?  I use an old fat black lady.  You got to, you gotta, why you ain't, um, don't you gotta get up at four?  Why you not, why you not sleeping yet? 
[00:49:30]  It's quarter to seven in the evening.  You gotta get up and do radio.  You know, you gotta be up and ready to go.  I'm, I'm like, I'm, I was last night I was sitting up playing my video games.  I was drinking diet, um, some type of root beer, diet, root beer, something.  And I was gulping down like, actually like M&M's, sugar-free turtles with the, um, the, the nuts in the, uh, in the caramel inside. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  That ain't good for you.  No.  But I think anything that says sugar-free and diet means I can eat about 10,000 of them.  So, last night I was just, there was no love interfering.  Yeah.  I got up, um, went to the bed, chilled out for a minute.  And, um, usually when she's there, um, for some reason she needs me in the bed with her to sleep.  So, at some point I have to read something with my cell phone, like, um, and she's cold like some old lady. 
[00:50:30]  And, um, I'm trying, I know.  Uh, this is so hard for me.  I know because.  Because we used to be the pimp trio.  Like, uh.  Card?  Card-carrying pimps.  Pimps, stump brain.  I mean, only, and only thing when I mean card-carrying pimp, I mean, boy did I have a lot of girls.  Yeah.  And they all knew about each other.  And didn't care.  Oh, I kept them in the matrix.  I said, look.  The blue pill.  Be happy when I'm there. 
[00:51:00]  Straight.  I'm going to have to go to the board.  You actually have a puppy.  You have a puppy.  Pimps don't have puppies.  Look, pimps do not shop for puppies.  You got a puppy bed.  Let me, let me tell you something else pimps don't ever say.  Wee-wee pad.  Oh, God.  It's over.  Pimps, pimps do not say wee-wee pad.  I'm still carrying the torch.  Look, man, you just came back, though. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  You just, let's say this.  You've been married a long time.  Yeah.  Now you, I mean, if I'm allowed to say this, information.  Yeah.  You're no longer married, right?  Right.  Officially signed on the dotted line.  Official, official.  But-  And thank God you ain't got nothing because she didn't get nothing.  Exactly.  Getting everything.  Exactly.  I got everything I came in with, which was nothing.  Nothing.  She got 50% of nothing, which means half of nothing.  She got point nothing.  But one thing, one thing I think, say about marriage is that I was really glad that I wasn't 
[00:52:00]  faithful because I would, if I was faithful, I would have really been upset about the divorce.  So-  Oof.  I can't join in with you.  I know my girl's listening right now and her a-hole just tightened up.  Here's what my girl does know.  She knows I don't want to be faithful.  She knows.  Go ahead.  What was the thing that pissed her off that we, I said some, oh, it was the threesome 
[00:52:30]  rules.  And I said, never, when you have a threesome, you never go and sleep with the other girl.  While she's not around?  When she's not around.  And after that, she was finished.  You can't, because she's, her biggest fear was that I would, I would cheat with her.  With the threesome girl.  With the threesome check.  But here's the reason it's her fault that we don't do that, by the way.  It's because she doesn't have patience for women. 
[00:53:00]  I'm not supposed, in the threesome world of rules, you are not supposed to, you're not  supposed to, two things.  One is, one is two girls and a guy is a threesome.  Two guys and a girl is a train.  Train.  Absolutely.  Um, if I need to get another guy, that's my responsibility.  If my girl wants to be with another man and me, that's my responsibility to get the guy.  If she wants to be, if I want to be with two girls and, you know, her and another girl,  it's her responsibility to get the girl, but she's unfriendly. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  So she doesn't want, she doesn't have patience.  She doesn't have patience for the stupid stuff that she does.  Well, my girl don't do that though.  Not no more.  She used to, but not.  Mmm.  Yeah, I remember.  Mmm, yeah.  The only thing my girl is now that is overwhelming is in love.  Her love is jubilant.  And, and, and you can't see that's the, that's their pimp move is to overwhelm you with their 
[00:54:00]  love where you can't say, Hey, will you stop loving me?  Like this morning, I got a text from her at four 15 when I'm supposed to get up.  Hey, it's four 15.  Like she doesn't have to be up till 12 noon.  There's no way I'm getting up at four 15 to check on her, to make sure her mom is still  living.  It's full.  We can figure this out at 10 30.  If you don't get up at four 15, my mama going to die. 
[00:54:30]  I'd be like, how about 10 30?  You better stay up through the night.  You think your mom, cause I just go to sleep at four 12.  But anyway, I bought her a dog and, um, a puppy for a daughter.  Cause ultimately here's something since she has a kid and I have to, I've learned about  this cause I love the kid.  The kid's a good kid.  But she, one thing is kids don't have friends no more.  She only has friends from school and she makes play dates. 
[00:55:00]  They don't go outside.  They don't, there's no mommy.  I'm going outside to play.  It's because I guess all, all of a sudden out of nowhere, everybody's a pedophile and  everybody's a kidnapper.  I don't know if more people get kidnapped and kids get touch funny than before.  Or they just advertise it more.  I don't know what's going on.  So ultimately, um, the kid is lonely.  She comes in and I see, she talks to herself.  She has full blown, like actual schizophrenia conversations with herself. 
[00:55:30]  Like very well-thought conversations.  Um, and not even with dolls.  Almost, she's almost grown.  She sits there, her legs are folding in the chair.  Uh, she likes a little pretend cigarette and just has conversations with herself.  But it's not cause of craziness.  It's just, no, it's just, it's just that she has 47 hours of homework.  If she misses school, she has to do, it's unreasonable, her schooling, unreasonable schooling going on now. 
[00:56:00]  And she has to come in and do these crazy, this crazy work.  She does her work.  Uh, and then all she has to do to relate is from adults, adult kind of things.  And she has to make play dates and all kinds of goofiness.  So ultimately, um, I said, let me get her a dog.  But of course I'm allergic.  So, I get the sniffles in my eyes, swell up, scratchy in my throat.  There's a, you know, there's a special cat that costs $75,000 called a Siamese agunga cat that doesn't have a lot of dander. 
[00:56:30]  So, you can kiss my dad.  So, I got her this little poodle, you know, and she's in love.  The girl's in love.  But also, um, Miss, um, I got her, you know, she's in love too.  So, and unfortunately, uh, this is where my pimp card gets canceled in.  I love the dog too. 
[00:57:00]  The dogs, I just, I'm a dog lover.  It's, I wish to God I wasn't an animal lover.  Animal, that slows me up.  I never saw I am legend because of the scene where I, where I heard he had to choke his dog because he got bit by the I am legend monsters and he had to kill his dog.  Oh, look at stunt brain made a sad blowing out.  Yeah, I can't see it either because of that.  You're a dog lover too.  I'm a dog lover.  I mean, dogs, I had a dog when I was 17, got hit by a car. 
[00:57:30]  I never had another one because I just, I didn't want to, I just didn't want to love something that much that didn't know my name, that didn't know, didn't know.  I couldn't, I had to figure out what it said.  So ultimately, um, I haven't seen that, um, three things, three animal things that, that touched me to my heart, right?  One or four, actually.  Thank you, sir.  Four things.  One is this thing where pit bulls attack bears.  There's a, there's a sport. 
[00:58:00]  I forgot.  Bear baiting.  Bear baiting.  It's a terrible thing.  I saw it.  It messed me up.  Um, baby seal club.  And I saw once when I was a kid and that, that messed me up.  Um, this new, this new polar bears.  Oh, drowning.  The drowning polar bears.  Global warming.  Horrible.  Because they can't.  They know where to sit.  They, there's icebergs that they swim from icebergs because of global warming.  They can't get to a stable iceberg. 
[00:58:30]  So they just drown in the water.  They can't swim.  There's nowhere to go.  Right.  They just know where to be.  And so polar bears just get in the water and just swim to their death.  Horrible.  Is there a fourth one?  I think that's three.  What is the other one?  Clubbing.  Dog fighting.  And actual dog fighting.  But that's not.  What about the, uh, the, the, the free range food as opposed to, uh, where they put the chickens  in a little, little box where they can't move.  I'm going to be quite honest with you. 
[00:59:00]  There's certain animals that get no sympathy.  Chickens is one.  What about veal?  Veal is terrible.  I stopped eating veal just because of the way they make veal.  Yeah.  Um, they make veal by making calves stand in a box.  Yeah.  And not move.  And anemic.  They make them anemic.  So it's a weird thing.  So anyway, I, I stopped, I stopped getting these.  I just didn't want to have an animal.  It bothered me too much.  But now I got this poodle and I'm trying to figure out how to get it to, uh, I don't  know what's going on, dude. 
[00:59:30]  Now it's a poodle.  And Stump Brain, you got a poodle.  Yeah.  Um, now the poodle's five months or something.  And we're, and we can't take it out quite yet because, um, it hasn't had all its shots.  So we don't get the shots, get it fixed and all that.  And right now we're wee-wee patting it.  Now some people.  I just can't hear you say that phrase.  Oh man, I used to boy.  The pimp boy.  Oh, I used to do threesomes every week.  And now I'm wee-wee patting it.  You're wee-wee pad training.  I'm-I'm-I'm plotting the death of my girl. 
[01:00:00]  She's dead.  I'm gonna have to kill her.  I already know what I'm gonna do too.  You know I'm for it.  Pillow over the head with a-with two silences.  I won't even pull the pillow off.  I'll duct tape the pillow over it so I don't see her poor face.  Which, by the way, I used to wonder why, um, a lot of-  I used to- this is President-President of Racism.  President of Racism.  Why white guys kill their wives.  I used to go, why don't you just leave them, white guy? 
[01:00:30]  What are you killing your wife for?  What does she do to you?  So, ultimately, I realized what it was.  One day I wanted to leave my girl.  For no other reason except for-  I was on the radio with that Dr. Z.  It was a lady named Dr. Z.  And we was on the radio.  And I said, Dr. Z, you look like you taste like pineapple juice.  Right?  And so, when I get home, my girl's like,  Why are the women tasting like pineapples?  I'm like-  I looked at her like, you know, you're not to interfere ever with what I say on the radio. 
[01:01:00]  I don't care what I say.  This is how you got your shoes.  You know?  So, shut your face.  So, I'm looking at her like, you know what?  I already want a 21-year-old to run around here naked for no reason.  And you're starting to bug me.  I don't want to look at your head.  The size of your head is starting to bug me.  And I was getting ready.  I said, brace yourself.  And she stood in the doorway of the bathroom.  And she made a face like she knew this was it. 
[01:01:30]  Like, not necessarily that I was leaving, but love was going to leave her life.  Like, just love in general.  And I looked at her and she had that welling up eye.  And I said, I said, you lucky I love you.  Because I'd rather you be dead than to break your heart.  I'd rather a train hit you than to watch you cry for something that I did. 
[01:02:00]  So, you better be lucky I got feelings for you.  And that is one of the most romantic things you've ever said.  Other than, here's some flowers, bitch, and I'm going to choke you.  Ready to get choked and here's some flowers.  So, anyway.  So, I got this dumb dog.  And it's a good dog.  I let it out.  I don't know what the proper way.  I'm crate training.  And some people go, oh, crate training.  Like, everything is. 
[01:02:30]  You've got to be a punk now for everything.  Oh, crate training.  So, I guess crate training is you've got to put the dog.  Bobby told me about this.  Bobby's got dogs.  And his dogs are in order.  Yeah.  They love them.  He's got three of them, too.  Two.  And they love them.  They love them.  And they're in order.  Right.  And crate training, I guess you put them in a box like Veal.  Yep.  With it.  They can barely move.  Right.  They can only move just to turn around in a circle.  And you keep them in the crate until they have to go to the bathroom. 
[01:03:00]  Then you let them out.  And they know where to go to the bathroom.  But right now, it's the wee-wee pads.  So, we let them go to the bathroom.  Then we let them out.  She goes to the bathroom on the wee-wee pads.  And then we have some type of you-peed-and-doodooed party.  Yay!  With a treat.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Oh, you do-doed.  Yay!  Do-do!  Yay!  Everybody do the doodle electric slide.  Little doggie doodle.  Go get the doggie cookie meat. 
[01:03:30]  The chocolate chip doggie cookie with the chips of beef and the cookies made out of rib and guar gum.  And we had this puppy party and this, that, and the third.  And it pees on the wee-wee pad.  And then we let it out.  Because now you can play when you doodle and pee.  Because you earned it.  You earned it.  Now she's running around.  And then at any given time, she just decides to take a dump anywhere she wants. 
[01:04:00]  Like on the carpet, she just goes, I think I'm a dump right here.  And you do the whole, hey, hey, hey, try to catch them and all that.  And you can't kick them in the ribcage like you could in the early 60s.  Right, right.  Up to about 85 where you catch them.  You see a piece of, you see them leave a package and you take them by the scruff of their neck.  Smush their face in them.  There's doodle on their nose.  And you punch them in the stomach.  And they don't even go, what, back in the 80s.  They didn't even go, what, they just took it.  They just took it like Denzel Washington from Glory. 
[01:04:30]  You kick them in the ass and just a tear runs down their cheek and they just take it like a soldier.  Choke them, beat them, and do whatever.  Rolled up, you know, newspaper.  And, you know, they made newspaper out of that unrecycled stuff that was heavy.  It was hard.  And you hit them like a baseball bat swing to keep them from peeing.  So you can't do that now.  You kind of got to go, oh, schnicky, that's a bad move.  Let's not do that.  And put them in the cage. 
[01:05:00]  And it's, I want to know how long do I have to be patient with this dog?  Like, when can I kick it?  Or when can I, stump brain, when can I choke the dog?  The dog's five months old.  So you've had it a month.  It's really not five months.  It's 17 years old.  Then you got problems.  No, it's five months.  But it's, isn't it like every month is 18 years?  Yeah, but it's a five-month-old dog. 
[01:05:30]  It's still a puppy.  You've got a while to go.  And I'm just sitting here thinking, how many of the regular O&A listeners are tuning in to the wee-wee pad puppy training discussion going, what happened?  Dude, I'm still in my heart a pimp.  I'm really trying to listen to you.  And I just keep fading off into when we used to shop for alligator shoes.  I still got them.  But you can't wear alligator shoes and buy these bags.  I'm going to tell you how she got me.  I'm going to tell you how she got me.  If she didn't have a daughter, she'd be in deep trouble. 
[01:06:00]  But I told you that.  If she didn't have a daughter, that ain't even my kid, by the way.  No, it doesn't matter.  When I first met her, I was like, eh, beat it, other guy's sack.  I said, hi, Mr. P. Beat it.  I don't like you.  Somebody else humped your mama and out you came.  What do I need you?  I don't even want to talk to you for.  You're talking to me.  Get this thing out of here.  I treat your mother like garbage.  Go to your daddy. 
[01:06:30]  But ultimately, I'm helping her with math.  She's just like, yay.  And I see my math training techniques working.  And I'm just sitting there going, oh, you make me sick.  I love this kid.  I either got rid of her or not even get rid of her.  Because I told my girl I'm not ever going to get rid of her.  I'm just demoting her back down to hoe.  She messes up.  You're being demoting.  Give me them stripes.  You're a hoe again. 
[01:07:00]  And now you have to work your way up back to Mrs. Hoe.  Just private hoe.  Bump you down to private hoe.  We talked about this before.  I was like, that kid will get under your skin.  She makes me sick that I care about the kid.  And here's her mother.  I bought the kid.  She's in the supermarket pimping me.  And she's real cool.  And we go to the supermarket and she goes,  Mr. P, you know, I was thinking my birthday's in nine months. 
[01:07:30]  And I need an iPod.  So I'm like, I'm like, ask your daddy.  Ask your daddy for a damn iPod.  Oh, Mr. P.  She introduced me to one of her friends.  This is my stepdad, Mr. P.  And she introduced me as he's half famous.  Which is really, he's half a celebrity. 
[01:08:00]  That's kind of accurate.  And she introduced me to that.  And I go like this.  I go like this.  I said to her, I said, I looked at her, right?  I didn't even say nothing to her.  She said, this is my stepdad.  And I looked at her like, and she goes, oh, shut up.  You know, you're my stepdad.  I went, man, you're right.  It's disgusting.  All right, we'll be back.  I'll pick it up. 
[01:08:30]  We're going to talk more about this crane because we got some calls about the,  whether it's, we got somebody from Julie.  All dogs are different.  Because I know white women are dog experts.  And they know how to train dogs without kicking them in the rib cage.  The number is 877-212-6263.  That's 877-212-6263.  O&A, Patrice O'Neal, Dante Nero.  We'll be right back. 
[01:09:00]  Hi.  Patrice O'Neal doing our show.  And, you know, it's going to be a good show.  But you're not going to get paid, Patrice.  Sorry.  Last night, Halloween fell on the weekend.  Me and Ghetto Boys are trick-or-treating.  Finding little hits with pads.  I don't know the words.  That's Isaac Hayes. 
[01:09:30]  I told you what I was going to tell him about.  That's Isaac Hayes.  I'm, what is it?  I'm hung?  Hung up on my baby.  Hung up on my baby.  Hung up on my baby.  Come on.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Mind playing tricks on me.  Ah.  It is unsung sample day.  Unsung sample day on the O&A show.  This is Patrice O'Neal with the young Dante Nero.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Hey, we got a call about these dogs and the proper way to train them. 
[01:10:00]  And I'm going to any women, because women seem to, you know, they don't believe any  type of violence or any type of, like, the thing about the crates, the crating, is like  something, some detail that you have to know is that you don't use the crate for punishment.  Right.  They can never think that the crate is a place of pain.  So when it does wrong, look at Stump Brain still moving.  Look at you.  So good.  God, if Isaac Hayes was alive, it might not have been slavery. 
[01:10:30]  It may have not been Jim Crow if Quincy Jones was allowed to play his music.  Do you see that?  Look at Stump Brain.  And Stump Brain's car carrying white man.  Oh, yeah.  And he was moving his shoulders.  See that?  And you don't even know what the rap song is to that classic song.  No, I don't.  Last night, Halloween came on a weekend.  Me and Ghetto Boys are trick-or-treating.  Oh, man.  Classic. 
[01:11:00]  Wait.  Looking around my shoulder.  Peek around my shoulder.  Looking around corners.  Looking around corners.  Peek around corners.  My mind playing tricks on me.  What a great song.  Anyway, we have Julie.  Julie?  Yep.  Hi.  You said all dogs are different?  I'm trying to figure out how to get this crating.  But see, let me say this, though, Julie.  Okay.  The dog kind of comes between my house and my girl's house. 
[01:11:30]  When she's at my...  The dog pretty much respects me.  Like, the dog doesn't do all of that stuff to me.  Because I...  Like, it wants to play.  And I just sit there and look at it like...  I'm not playing with you until you take your dump.  It takes this dump.  And it doesn't do anything to really betray me.  But I don't...  The dog stays with my girlfriend and her daughter most of the time.  And so I'm trying to figure out how to get them not only to respect them, but also to not do-do on the rug. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, that's always...  That's a tough thing.  Well, the one thing is, the biggest mistake people make when they...  I have two German Shepherd puppies.  I got a three-month-old and a seven-month-old.  Okay.  Yeah.  And the biggest mistake people make is when they crate train, they put newspaper or those stupid wee-wee pads that you pay way too much money for.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  All right.  Okay.  And the crate.  The thing is, when puppies, when they're born and when they're weaned, there's always, like, newspaper and stuff with the mother.  So they associate that paper with peeing. 
[01:12:30]  And the wee-wee pads with peeing.  So if you put them in the crate, they're going to pee in the crate.  But I don't put them in the crate.  See, there's a little pillow in the crate, right?  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus, I'm gay.  I have to...  Proposition 8, I vote up.  I vote up for proposition.  As a matter of fact, I'm marching for them.  God, I'm gay.  It's a female puppy.  And we don't put it...  We don't...  The wee-wee pads are outside the crate. 
[01:13:00]  We got a pillow in there from...  Because what I understand about dogs, they don't like to do anything where they sleep.  So it comes out and it goes to the wee-wee pad.  But the problem is it goes to the wee-wee pad and we have the little you-peed party.  And then when it's part, it just decides, you know what?  I'm going to dump right here.  And then it keeps playing.  So the instinct is...  Most dogs won't even pee where they poop. 
[01:13:30]  They don't...  For some reason, my dog...  Really?  I take my dogs outside.  They'll pee in one place.  They'll go about 10 more feet and they'll poop someplace else.  I don't know why that is.  But the thing is, especially when they're puppies, you've got to watch them.  You've really got to watch them because, I mean, I would sit up all night.  My little...  My girl, she...  Let me tell you, she's a bitch.  My other one, he never peed in the house, never pooped.  He'd go...  Even when he was two months old, he'd go right where I brought him home.  He went right to the door and go out.  What was your technique, though?  What was...  I mean...  Unfortunately, the technique is not getting a lot of sleep. 
[01:14:00]  You've got to watch them and start knowing when they start getting, like, funky and restless  and start, like, tripping out.  Well, you do it on my rug.  Yeah.  Like, I mean, you're on my rug.  Hey, baby, you got to stay up.  Well, all right.  Thank you, Julie.  We've got to go to Ethel.  Ethel in Ohio?  Hello?  Hi.  How are you?  What's your deal?  What's going on?  Okay.  What you need to do is what's called bench training your puppy.  What is it?  You have to put it into... 
[01:14:30]  Bench training.  You have to put it into the cage or tie it to a bench.  That's why it's called bench training.  And then you have to...  That sounds...  Wait a minute.  That sounds extreme for a white lady.  Like, usually, y'all are very anti any of that.  Like, usually, it's just a lot of tickling and stuff.  But just saying, tie it to a bench and just...  Yeah, I'm not saying joking.  I'm saying, tie it like with a leash so that because a dog, most dogs, and I know pit bulls  are different, but most dogs are not going to pee where they sleep. 
[01:15:00]  And it was a vet that actually taught this to me because I was using the paper training  method.  And he said, do not do that because you're teaching it to go in the house.  What you have to do is bench train it.  So you put it in its house, its cage, and you said you have a cage for it.  And you put it in its cage, and what it will do is bark and yip at night when it has to  go to the bathroom.  You have to get up and take it outside.  And by doing that, you're teaching it to go outside.  And my dog, it took it a week to do it. 
[01:15:30]  Now, Ethel, does that mean that the crate actually...  This is Dante.  The crate itself becomes the den, the dog's den or the dog's home?  Yeah, that's the dog's house.  That's the dog's home.  So it feels comfortable, like secure in that den.  So this wee-wee pad situation is just useless.  My dog, when I first got her, she was six weeks old, and she was peeing and pooping all  over the house.  And when I took it to the bed... 
[01:16:00]  Wait, you only crate it at a certain time?  You only crate it at night?  At night.  Every night when you go to bed, you put the dog in there, and that's the dog's bed.  So don't crate it before the bedtime.  So what do you do with the dog during that whole daytime thing?  You let it run around?  You leave it out, but if it goes in the house, you take it outside, and you show it...  No, you go outside.  Just like you were saying, you rub its nose in it.  You do rub its nose in it.  So you do do the whole rubbing nose in it? 
[01:16:30]  Yes, you do.  You make that dog smell it, and then you take it outside.  Is that only when you catch it?  You show it, that's where it goes.  And how about a rolled-up People magazine?  No, you don't hit it.  All right, all right.  The only way you correct it is flick it in the nose.  A dog cannot stand to be flicked in the nose.  Okay.  Don't flick it hard, but you just give it a flick in the nose.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Not Steve, sorry.  It's Ethel.  I'm looking at the nose.  Thank you, Ethel.  Joyce?  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Hi.  You a dog breeder?  I am.  I've been doing it for 15 years.  All these women have no idea what they're talking about.  All right.  Now, you're not one of these breeders that the reason my damn dog got some...  Hooping cough.  Some hooping cough because the damn trachea is not fully developed because they breeded  the mother with an ostrich.  God, I got this shit.  No, no, no.  $1,200 retarded dog.  I have to breed maybe twice a year.  I breed when I want to keep something to show.  What kind of dog do you breed?  Japanese chin. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, okay.  They really, wow, rich people dogs fit for what, like 5 Gs for those, right?  $1,200 plus.  And what's the...  Family.  Okay.  Well, well, well.  All right.  So here's my suggestion.  Okay.  First off, is this puppy, like, pooping in one certain spot or is it just pooping all  over the house?  No.  It poops on the...  It poops.  Wait, let me get a hold of my...  Pimp card revolt.  Homosexuality, I am finished. 
[01:18:00]  Wait, let me just get a hold of myself, Joyce.  It poops...  Woo!  It poops on the wee-wee pads and pees on the wee-wee pads.  And when it does mess up, it only messes up in one spot.  Okay, well then, what you need to do is take those wee-wee pads, which I agree with the  woman that called in about the whole wee-wee pad thing.  I would try to switch over to newspaper. 
[01:18:30]  Number one, you know, it doesn't cost as much, but, you know, most puppies will go on either  or.  So I would try to the newspaper instead of spend all that money on wee-wee pads, you  know, because it's just ridiculous.  Well, you know, only the best for my dog, wee-wee pads.  Only the best for my poodle, all that old newspaper.  Now, wait a minute, though.  We're trying to figure out why it, from time to time, and it knows, here's the thing, the  dog's smart enough to know that when it goes to, that it has a disco party when it takes 
[01:19:00]  a dump and pees.  So she, when she's not getting played with, she goes, all right, come on, she absolutely  squeezes one out so that she can play, and then she goes and doodles on the damn rug.  Well, let me ask you this.  Okay, when she doodles, does she go around and do her doodle dance, you know, do the whole  circle thing?  Because if you have to catch them when they're doing that.  She's always sniffing around, though, but that, Bobby told me this, that dogs actually 
[01:19:30]  are embarrassed to doodle sometimes in front of people, like she only doodles when no one's  around.  Okay, well, okay, wherever she's doodling at, you need to put a pee-pee pad there, okay?  Start off by doing that.  Plus, also, the scent is already there where she's doodling.  So you need to try to, you know, there's a lot of different products on the market that 
[01:20:00]  you can use to try to get that scent out of there, because she thinks, okay, well, I pooped  here, and here I'm going to poop here again, because, you know, I did it before.  So the scent's there.  You need to try to get it out of the rug or whatever it is that you have down, you know,  at that particular spot where she keeps going.  All right.  And then, you know, put a pad there, because, you know, number one, she's going there already.  But won't that, wait a minute, won't that have her think that that's her pee place? 
[01:20:30]  Like, if I support that she's peeing there.  Well, what you're going to do is move it gradually towards where she's supposed to go.  First off, I think you're maybe you're giving her a little bit too much room to run, being  in a young puppy like that, if you're giving her the entire house to run in, you know,  then, you know, maybe you should try to restrict it off to maybe a kitchen area or, you know, 
[01:21:00]  maybe a laundry area or something like that, and try to keep her confined.  Now, when you guys are out paying attention to her and she's, you know, and playing with  her, then bring her out at that particular point.  But maybe confine her to one, you know, like smaller area, make sure she has her pee-pee  pads in there.  And then that way, she knows that that's where I'm supposed to be going.  I'm going on the pee-pee pad, you know.  And right now, I think you have given her a little bit too much freedom for being such 
[01:21:30]  a young puppy.  Maybe like you talking right now, Joyce.  Jesus Christ.  Do I have to put a wee-wee pad down for your mouth?  Will you slow down for a minute?  Jesus Christ.  Joyce, we got to take another call.  Thank you for calling, sweetie.  That's a lot of work.  Why don't you just have a baby?  I tried.  I don't think I'm working.  And Lord, that feels good.  Hey, Chris, what's up, man?  What's up?  How are you, man?  Listen, that lady you just had on can't be a dog beater. 
[01:22:00]  There's no way.  All right.  Nobody knows nothing.  My family's bred dogs from the time I was like five years old.  I remember teaching dogs to go to the bathroom outside.  I'm going to tell you, your accent sounds like you really love animals.  He's like, hey, there, come here.  Come here, Fluffy.  I love you, you.  Go ahead, man.  I'm sorry.  No, but the first thing any dog breed will tell you is there aren't no bad dogs.  There's just unattentive owners. 
[01:22:30]  If you know your dog's going to go, like if you know your dog, you can know your dog.  You look at it, you know it's getting ready to, you know, it'll circle.  It'll walk in circles, and then it'll take the dump.  Right.  You catch a dog as it's circling, pick it up since it's a puppy, walk it outside, and let it go.  It's that easy.  Wait a minute.  So, basically, what everybody's really saying right now, I hear, is wee-wee pads are ridiculous.  They're retarded.  They're a way to make money off your pet. 
[01:23:00]  They're like coats.  You don't need to buy a coat for your dog.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Thanks for your call, dude.  We don't have to think about this.  Oh, man.  Sounds like more time.  You got to put more time watching them.  All right, man.  Booth.  Boy, boy, boy, boy.  Steve?  Hey, what's up, Patrice?  How are you, sir?  I'm trying to figure out this whole thing with this dog.  Please help.  All right, listen.  Here's the deal.  When we were growing up, if we did something wrong, like, what did our parents do to us?  I got a beating. 
[01:23:30]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Okay?  I got two dogs.  You know, I almost feel-  Wait a minute.  Let me absorb this right now, because, dude, I'm feeling you.  I had a dog that, back in the day, you punched it in the eye.  That's it.  And they stopped going outside.  But it's just the same thing as children.  We can't do it.  That's it.  All right, punch it out.  All right, thanks, man.  We cannot-  You can't do it no more. 
[01:24:00]  You can't kick the dog in the stomach like you could in the early age.  You've got to be on ASPCA Dallas Cop.  You cannot-  Animal police.  Put the dog in a cobra clutch until it slightly-  The chicken wing.  It slightly starts to go to sleep, and then you hit it on the back of the neck to wake  it up.  Because we could hit a dog.  When I grew up, you hit a dog with newspaper. 
[01:24:30]  The dog went-  It smushed his nose in it.  The dog knew something bad was happening.  And if it doodered on the floor, it would look at you like it knew it did something wrong  and run for its life until you cornered it, hit it with a golf club, and dunked his head  in water while you wore your No. 7 Atlanta Hawks jersey.  Oh, man. 
[01:25:00]  I'm going to take a couple more calls, man.  Justine, make it quick, beautiful.  What's your advice?  No, I was just going to say you need to pay attention to your dog, because when we got  our puppy, he was three months old, and we would keep him in a crate when we weren't  playing with him.  We always watched him, and we would take him out every hour in the beginning and give  him a cookie every time he would go outside.  And then he got used to going outside and going to the bathroom, and now he'll come up 
[01:25:30]  to us when he has to go and just, like, make noises and just do, like, a pee-pee dance.  And how old is your dog now, though?  He's a year and a half.  He'll come up to you and go,  How long did it take you to train him?  About, like, two weeks.  Because you just got...  So it's five months.  So it's five months.  How much more time before I have to...  You're supposed to keep him in a crate for at least a year when you're not home or when 
[01:26:00]  they're sleeping, because it gets them used to being...  When they're by themselves, then they get used to, like, keeping themselves busy.  They don't get bored.  And then later on, when they're alone, they won't chew up your house, because he needed...  You know, he's a Labrador, so he needed to figure out how to keep himself entertained  and keep the crate trained.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to tell my girl to listen to this, because this is people helping her out,  because don't do it on my rug. 
[01:26:30]  Thanks for calling, sweetie.  Anyway, we'll take one more call.  Let me take...  JP.  Yo, Patrice.  Yes, sir.  What's up, bro?  Enough with these women.  It goes in the house.  I couldn't...  That's how I feel about it.  I'll punch that dog right in the mouth.  Punch his baby teeth out.  But let me tell you something.  Listen, you are a man who tries to tell me, oh, you've got to train your woman. 
[01:27:00]  You've got to keep your woman in line.  Ah, there you go.  And you can't stop your dog from peeing on the floor?  How are you training a woman?  It ain't my M-I-F-ing floor, I told you.  I'm trying to help this bitch to stop doodling on this other bitch's carpet.  Well, you better train...  You better not be saying you can train a woman if you can't stop a dog from peeing on the floor.  But you can...  This is what I was saying to Dante off-air.  I can talk to a woman.  They understand the communication in terms of...  I don't...  I don't catch my girl peeing on the floor and then grab her by the scrum for her neck and go, bad girl? 
[01:27:30]  Even though...  Yeah.  You actually...  I don't know.  But what I'm saying is, the dog...  Look, I watched that season of Milan, and he's gangster with me.  Yeah.  He's amazing.  But I'm saying, what you do with women is a social thing.  Dogs is this animal thing.  Even though the woman thing is animal, too.  Yeah.  But you've got to understand what I'm saying.  What are you...  I mean...  You've got to figure out what relates to women. 
[01:28:00]  Some pimps...  Some pimps hit their women, and some pimps don't.  I figured...  The problem is, you just said it yourself.  You said there's a difference between, you know, you treat a woman like a woman and an animal as an animal.  You're trying to treat with all these women saying, be nice and give it a cookie.  That's treating it like a person.  It's a dog.  If it pees on the floor, kick it.  I'm out.  He's got out of here.  If it pees on the floor, kick it in.  That's all. 
[01:28:30]  Hey.  Oh, man.  What are you going to figure out?  I just want to take another break.  Hey, and when we get back, a special, special guest, man.  Yeah.  One of my favorite people in the world and comics to boot, J.B. Smoove, will be with us after the break.  Awesome.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neill, Dante Nero.  Take care.  Yeah, if you're listening to the show and you don't hear Opie and Anthony, that's because we're not here. 
[01:29:00]  But Patrice O'Neill is.  Yeah.  So listen to him.  Let me give you a little synopsis of the show.  Bitches suck.  Whitey sucks.  Whitey sucks.  Patrice rules.  Repeat.  I can't argue with none of that.  I told you I'm equal president of racism, equal opportunity. 
[01:29:30]  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Let me stop right now before we get self-indulged and introduce a great, great man in the studio.  Let me give him the proper introduction.  This young man, when I started comedy, it was 1992, and I came here in New York 96 or 97, and his legend was already, he preceded himself as he's texting somebody who doesn't really love him as much as I do. 
[01:30:00]  But he's one of the guys that, there's a few guys, maybe four or five I can think of, whose success, my success hinges on his success.  Right.  Because there's certain people that have to be household names before they get their due.  Before you can.  Yeah.  So the universe would be right.  Right.  And this young man is moving towards that.  And quite frankly, I have to say this, precedent of racism, that white people have helped out tremendously, unfortunately, because he is king. 
[01:30:30]  King when I came here.  Comics comic.  Yeah.  Well respected.  Never heard he even slightly borrowed anybody's jokes like Dr. Dre did Leon Hayward.  That's right.  Originator.  Today, by the way, is Unsung Sample Hip Hop Day.  What? 
[01:31:00]  We are playing all unsung samples of hip hop songs, the songs that they sample from, that people just don't know and understand that this is where it came from.  But, ladies and gentlemen, drum roll please, the great from, what's the, the damn, no, also, he plays one of the characters, the black family that was adopted from Katrina on Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Ladies and gentlemen, the young, talented, good looking, smooth ass, J. 
[01:31:30]  You can't even tell.  The fact that you're saying chicken.  You can't tell.  Chicken patty.  In the vegetable, what is chicken about?  It's a soy product.  What is it?  Is it the texture?  It's the texture, man.  The texture that tastes like chicken.  Maybe it don't peel like chicken does, but the taste is, they can make anything nowadays, man.  You would not know the difference, man.  I would come back in the studio a year from now, you'll be down to 180 pounds, man. 
[01:32:00]  You're like, you know what, JB?  JB, you really changed my life, man.  Look at me, man.  I've been the same way since high school.  That's what I'm saying.  You always, you've always been that big even when pork was in your life.  I fit kids' clothes, man.  JB, you got Crohn's disease.  You kidding me, man?  Look at me, man.  JB, you look the same without the mustache at 12.  I'm telling you, man, I have ran into cats from my high school, man.  They're like, these dudes are like grandfathers, man. 
[01:32:30]  They're like, yo, man, what the hell, you been in a time machine?  Look at you, man.  You're the same weight since high school.  But you know what I mean?  I'm active, but at the same time, I'm eating kind of good, man.  But not to say I don't slip.  Same drinking?  Not to say I don't slip.  Same drinking?  What kind of drinking?  I don't drink, man.  No, no, no.  Not liquor.  Oh.  A lot of water.  Just water.  Just water.  Water.  You know what's good to you?  Cranberry juice is excellent, man.  Cranberry juice.  And you know what?  You got a urine tracker for it?  No, I know what?  You do it, too, bro.  You got to put it on your period.  I'll tell you another thing, man. 
[01:33:00]  You got to move them bowels, baby.  Yeah.  Get some apple juice, man, in your system, baby.  How about metamucil?  I'm telling you, there's nothing better than a reason to wait on it.  I'm going to move your bowels, man.  Riblets, apple juice, and cranberry juice.  That's good for you, man.  Apple juice is great.  Have you ever heard of controlled?  That cleans you up.  Apple juice cleans you up.  Have you ever heard of controlled diarrhea?  What?  That's controlled diarrhea.  Never in my life.  Apple juice?  Yeah.  Apple juice is controlled diarrhea, man.  How about metamucil?  That means you can control your diarrhea.  How about metamucil?  Man, don't start using stuff like that, man. 
[01:33:30]  It's supposed to be just fiber.  Metamucil?  I drank that.  You can do that eating some good cereal in the morning, man.  Apple juice, I'm telling you, man.  Apple juice run right through you.  Apple juice is the liquid garbage, man.  I'm telling you, man.  It's the liquid garbage, man.  It removes it naturally.  Organic.  Controlled diarrhea.  Organic.  So now you don't do the...  Show your diarrhea, man.  You don't do the colonics or nothing.  No, no, no, man.  I'm going to tell you, man.  Controlled diarrhea.  Diarrhea, I'm going to tell you.  I'll be the first one to tell you.  Diarrhea is nobody's friend.  I'm going to tell you right now.  In its wild state. 
[01:34:00]  Right.  But if you control your diarrhea.  Chaotic diarrhea.  If you can say, you know what?  I got diarrhea, but I can hold it for another hour.  But if you cannot hold your diarrhea, that's when you've got a problem.  Oh, I see what he's saying.  Controlled diarrhea.  I see what he's saying.  That means your bowels move naturally nice, man.  It's a natural sickness.  It's a natural sickness.  And don't be afraid of you.  Don't be afraid to drink a glass of prune juice.  You know what's good, too?  A prune juice diet, man.  Why don't you say not be afraid, JB?  Don't be afraid, man.  No, it's helping you out.  It's helping you.  It's doing you a damn favor. 
[01:34:30]  Prune juice does not have to help you.  Afraid of what aspect of it?  Afraid of losing control of yourself.  You know what I mean?  Now, I'm going to tell you what.  You're going to go to any restaurant and get sick and get uncontrollable diarrhea.  Chaotic.  Where you have to get your butt home before a certain amount of time.  And you know what?  Then you're going to have controlled diarrhea.  Well, you know what?  I'm going to drink this apple juice because I know this apple juice is good for me.  Right, right. 
[01:35:00]  And I know it's going to move my bowels nice and smooth.  Right.  But if you go to a restaurant, you know, some Peking duck or whatever it is, and you get food poisoning, guess what?  You have no control over what's going to happen to you.  Let me plug the show again.  JB is going to have uncontrolled diarrhea tonight.  Chaotic.  Chaotic.  Chaotic.  Diarrhea.  My paper down right quick because I don't, you know, I can control it, but I still have to lay my paper down. 
[01:35:30]  He's going to be at Comics tonight, tomorrow night, 8 o'clock, 10 o'clock.  That's Comics.  That is on 343 West 14th Street in Manhattan.  Numbers 2-1-2-5-2-4.  Hold on.  JB's going to the bathroom.  2-1-2-5-2-4-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2-5-2.  JB's move.  Two shows tonight, two shows tomorrow at Comics.  Let me ask you a question, JB.  You've been in the game how long?  Oh, God, man.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:36:00]  Put it like this.  I will say this much.  I was around in the heyday of black comedy.  I'm talking about when I turned that corner and Def Comedy Jam.  Ninety?  Ninety, ninety-one?  Yep.  I met...  Well, I started in ninety-two.  When did you start?  Oh, I actually started a few years around that time because I actually quit my job when my  daughter was born.  She was born in ninety-three.  So, I quit my job on the day she was born, man, and started doing straight comedy. 
[01:36:30]  But you kind of started it like around then.  I started around then.  Before that...  Because when I came to New York, you was already, you know, it was you, the names for like the...  I mean, I guess you call it Chitlin' Circuit, I suppose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The names out there, it was you, Talent, of course.  And Mike.  And Mike.  No, not the names I heard.  It was JB.  Talent was up there.  Right.  JB, where JB was the Comics comic.  Yeah.  It was a guy named... 
[01:37:00]  He was a fireman.  The rest of...  Wyatt, the one-man riot.  Stuntbrain, did you just say the rest of...  I'm thinking...  Why does white guys always...  He was a cop, man.  Don't interrupt blackness.  How are you guys going to throw out Nipsey Russell like that?  Do you really know Nipsey Russell like that?  It was Wyatt.  Wyatt, the one-man riot.  Wyatt, the one-man riot.  Wyatt was great.  But you were...  I'm not even lying.  JB was the man.  When I came here from Boston, JB was that, like, the guy that...  Yeah, he was the guy. 
[01:37:30]  He was the Comics comic.  People liked him.  He was just originality, the whole thing.  Now, let me ask you a question.  So, you started in a chitlin circle.  I started in Boston, so it was more white clubs.  And how is it now having white friends?  White...  Not keeping it real.  What's the difference now, kind of...  I have to say, like, you know, there's...  It's, you know, it takes some getting used to in terms of...  What's the difference between the vibe, the feeling between dealing with... 
[01:38:00]  What's the guy from Curb?  Larry David.  Larry David and Brad Garrett.  Brad Garrett.  Garrett and the fact that you came from Def Jam.  You came from, you know, in terms of underground, you know, street vibe, Def Jam.  And now you're just getting that kind of recognition, you know, on Fox, on HBO.  And it seems like your career has taken off.  What's the, you know, what's the difference that you...  You know, what is the difference?  You know what, though?  I will say this. 
[01:38:30]  When I started, I definitely started in the Def Jam era, but I also always was a comic  to write for the masses, even though I...  Oh, don't get me wrong, dude.  Let me make sure people don't understand that I am not saying that JB was a dude that had...  That did not, you know, he...  Cross boundaries.  JB was...  Everyone loved JB.  Yeah.  But I'm saying you made your bones in the hood.  Exactly, yeah.  And then now it's like, who's this dude that's exploded on the scene, but you've been around 
[01:39:00]  a long time, and is there a difference?  Do you find yourself going, you know, wow, I wish this was the case a long time ago?  Are you doing the same exact material that you do in a so-called white room, and then when  you go do chilling rooms, are you 100% the same, or you adjust, or what do you do now?  You know what, I kind of kept it the same, man.  I would say I kept it the same.  Only thing that changes, you know, you don't change, your audience changes, but your audience 
[01:39:30]  is more, you know, now they accept, you know, what you are saying on stage as who you are.  So it's like a way of getting your voice out there without having to change yourself.  Before, when people don't know you, it's more that you have to prove you're funny, but  now you have a brand in terms of the humor and everything.  So how is it working on the show?  Oh, it's awesome.  It's awesome, man.  You know, I think I've also prepared myself for a lot of stuff that's going on right now, 
[01:40:00]  only because even though I started in the Def Jam BET era, I also, you know, varied my  resume.  I also did one of the first pilots ever on MTV called Apartment 2F.  I did Kamikaze.  That was with the Sklar Brothers.  Exactly.  I remember that.  I was on that pilot.  I did Kamikaze.  I did Short Attention Span Theater on the early years of Comedy Central.  You know what I mean?  I did a lot of stuff.  So my resume looks like I can do almost anything.  I can go anywhere.  You know, I did Apollo, I did BET, I did the Def Comedy Jam. 
[01:40:30]  What was the pop?  What was the thing?  What's the thing now that's kind of, because you've been around, but right now you are bubbling.  You are bubbling, and what was the thing that made everybody all of a sudden go, who's this  guy, J.B. Smoove, that just came around after 20 years?  I think that's the fun part of your journey, because what happens is when you get out there  and you start doing what you do, you keep doing it, keep doing it, keep trying to do as many 
[01:41:00]  things as possible, keep your resume varied, keep doing different things, always challenge  yourself to do something different.  By the time you get to where you need to be at, you're kind of prepared for it.  So me, by the time I got to do Curb, although I had done a lot, my audience did change.  Now I'm pulling people in who never even, they never heard of me.  But that's the good thing about being in that position, because you can shoot your load and  be done with yourself by now.  I know plenty of cats who peaked so high, fast, and then all of a sudden, they're kind of lost. 
[01:41:30]  It's like, where's so-and-so?  Where's so-and-so?  So for me, I kind of take that in stride, that I'm happy that I didn't hit my full peak  back then.  Until you was ready.  I would have been done right now.  Right, right.  I would have been like, damn.  Smart man.  All right, did my TV pilot.  Damn, it didn't make it.  Damn, I'm still waiting around for that.  But I'm happy, I'm a little older now.  But at the same time, I'm happy that I didn't get where I want to go yet, because I can still  look forward to it.  You like the bubbling thing.  I like to look forward to it. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, exactly.  I like to look forward to it.  JB's going to be at Comics tonight, tomorrow, with two shows, 8 p.m., 10 p.m., Comics Comedy  Club on 343 West 14th Street in Manhattan, 212-524-2500.  We got to take a break.

There, Patrice O'Neill doing the show, because Obama president, nah. 
[01:42:30]  See what happens when you've got a black president?  Yep.  They take over the radio airwaves as well.  The whitest show on radio all of a sudden has a black host filling in.  See, if it's started, my friends, Patrice O'Neill filling in for Opie and Anthony.  Put it on the line, put it on the line, put it on the line, put it on the line, I don't  want no name, life season, I gotta have a name, show on the line.

That's hot.  Why even mess with that?  Exactly.  Wait a minute.  So, today is unsung sample day.  So, since we have a young man, you grew up with hip hop, JB?  Hip hop fans?  I'm going to tell you something about my hip hop, Hummel Beginnings, man.

The first joint that ever dropped.  That's my number one also.  LL Cool J's first album.  Ba-bam.  Is this in order?  It's in order.  So, wait a minute.  Which one?  Which one, though?

Let me hear your five.  Let me hear your five.  Run DMC's first album, Run DMC.  Self-titled.  Number two.

[01:45:00]  If you're going to go out west with a Reasonable Doubt.  Number five all time.  All right, play that song again, Stunt.  Let me hear that.  This is the unsung hip-hop song, but this is the test to make sure that you see what you know.  Name that stolen.  Name that stolen tune.  Put the hat on.  Put the hat on.  Make my fake ID out.  Ready?  Listen to the beat.  I need some guarantee. 
[01:45:30]  Tell me.  Come on, Jay.  What you're going to do.  Is it west or east?  East.  It's east, baby.  Stop this.  Stop it.  It's over.  It's over.  It's a rap.  How dare you.  I can't get this one, man.  How dare you.  Tell him.  I can't get it.  I shot you, LL Cool J.  Damn.  I can't make a dollar out of 15 cents and let my bees hang like I'm on the toilet.  My style is all that and a big bag of chips with some dip. 
[01:46:00]  That's nice.  With all that.  Hit him with the Isaac Hayes, Danny.  Give me another try.  Give me another try, baby.  Oh, here's the...  Oh!  Oh!  I'm getting chills in my spine when I hear that right there.  Yeah.  Uncle L, baby.  Ooh!  Yep.  You're right, man.  That was banging.  Sick.  All right, ready?  Give me something else, man.  Give me another chance, man.  Give me another try about this, man.  Which one do you want?  Which one? 
[01:46:30]  Isaac Hayes.  The one from earlier?  Yes.  I think I got that.  I think you do.  Damn.  The rap.  The rap song to this.  Now, this is Isaac Hayes.  I sit alone in my home.  I don't know the words,  but I know who it is.  Who is it?  I sit alone in my four-cornered room  with the candles. 
[01:47:00]  You can't miss that one, boy.  He got it.  He got it.  Bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill, bill.  Yep.  That's the Ghetto Boys.  The Ghetto Boys featuring Scarface, baby.  We're going to take a quick call.  Somebody's a big fan on the line, I guess.  Keith?  Keith?  Keith?  Can you hear me now?  Sorry, buddy.  Can you hear me now?  We try, Keith.  All right. 
[01:47:30]  Give him.  Hit it.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Give him.  Ready?  Give him Quincy Jones, Danny.  Let's do it, baby.  Let me see what I got.  I know, JB.  I don't know.  Let me see what I got.  Let me see what I got, man.  Oh, yeah.  I'm in the group.  Oh, God darn it. 
[01:48:00]  It's a weird name.  This is the Quincy Jones.  This is Summer in the City by Quincy Jones.  Oh.  Start it over.  We'll give you one last time.  I got another group.  Wait, I got another group.  You about to lose your car, JB.  What's the group?  Digable Planets?  No, no, no.  Not Digable.  One more time.  One more time.  He got it.  He got it.  No, he got it.  Hit him with it. 
[01:48:30]  You're killing him.  It's the far side.  Far side.  Far side.  Darn it, man.  I'm sitting here like.  Wait, Danny.  You got the, you know.  I thought it was Digable first.  You got the real song.  You got the rap song.  Passing me by.  Then I thought it was Main Source.  I said, not Main Source.  What is it?  Darn it.  Nice.  I'm asking, and I'm serious.  Nice.  I was close, though.  I knew it.  I was discussing with Dante that I may denounce hip hop.  This is the rap song to that, by the way. 
[01:49:00]  When I tell you all the parties.  See, you came in.  You came in from somewhere else.  I was here when it was going down, baby.  You don't understand, man.  I used to have a fake ID.  I used to be in the Funhouse.  The Roxy stand.  Danceteria.  I used to stand on the line in the Roxy.  The Roxy had this long corridor that went up into the club.  Yeah, yeah.  With the purple light with the white gloves on.  I used to be in the middle of the circle pop-locking and everything, man.  With a fake ID going up in that bad boy.  What? 
[01:49:30]  That's it.  I'm from back in the day, baby.  Oh, man.  All right, well, okay, wait a minute.  Hit him with the Daisy Lady.  Okay.  Let's do this, baby.  Hit him with the Daisy Lady.  I'm getting there.  I'm getting there.  You ain't got there once yet.  We let you get away with the rap.  Yeah, you're right.  Come on now.  Oh, oh, y'all went way back this time.  New York, Mr. Roxy. 
[01:50:00]  He's pop-locking.  He's pop-locking.  He's in the way.  JV's going back by the dance of the song.  That is 8th Wonder by Sugar Hill Gang.  Sugar Hill Gang, baby.  But the song is called Daisy Lady by 7th Wonder.  7th Wonder, baby.  Here's the one that's your namesake.  Hit him with the grunt.  Man, that's cold.  Dude, this is unsung sample day.  Oh, wrong one. 
[01:50:30]  That's all right.  Wait, hang on a second.  I don't know, JB.  Drop it, baby.  Drop it.  Drop it.  You didn't hit one yet on the money.  I didn't hit one.  I did not hit one on the money.  All right.  All right.  We'll give you a couple minutes on this one.  Just keep listening. 
[01:51:00]  Keep listening.  To the break.  Keep listening.  We're going to get to the break.  We're going to get to the break.  Keep listening.  Keep listening, JB.  Keep listening to the back of this.  Look at that beat.  Ready?  Come on. 
[01:51:30]  Come on.  He got to go.  JB.  I can't take it.  All right.  Turn it off.  Ladies and gentlemen.  I can't take it, man.  JB Smooth.  Name.  You'll name that.  What song is that, man?  He'll be at Comics tonight and tomorrow night.  Public Enemy number one.  No.  What's the song?  What's the song?  Next to the Millions of Holders.  No.  JB Smooth.  JB Smooth is a big album.  Who once was a part of the hip-hop community has now been expelled.  He's just been relinquished.  Oh.  No longer keeping it real.  He's German dog and the pink nails. 
[01:52:00]  He'll be at Comics Comedy Club.  Man.  Tonight, tomorrow night, two shows.  8 p.m., 10 p.m. at Comics Comedy Club.  Drack.  3-43 West 14th Street.  2-1-2-5-2-4-2-5-2-5-0.  JB doesn't like hip-hop anymore.  Smooth.  Man, I'm going to tell you something, man.  I love hip-hop, man.  I'm going to tell you something.  I'm not a big rap fan, but I sure am a hip-hop fan.  I don't believe you, man.  I'll tell you something about milestones, man.  I done been in there, baby. 
[01:52:30]  I was in there.  I was in there.  Oh, what?  What?  What?  What?  You got what I need.  You got everything I need.  You're like medicine to me.  Oh, baby.  Biz Markie, you got what I need.  Easy one.  But they say you're just a friend.  Oh.  You say you're just.  Oh, baby.  I got it.  How much time we got?  About a minute.  All right, plug your show, Dante.  All right, I'm going to be at the Eastville Comedy Club tonight and Saturday night.

Thanks, Sam.  Young Sam.  Thank you, Danny.  Thank you, O&A, for letting Patrice O'Neal and Dante sing it for you.  And remember, unsung sample day.  You can't listen to hip-hop today.  It's only the sampled music. 
[01:54:00]  Danny, can we go out with some type of something?  Choose something, my friend.  Choose your favorite out of all these today.  Hey, it's O&A, man.  Appreciate you guys listening today.  See you later.  Thanks, O.  Thanks, A.  Bye-bye. 
[01:54:30]  This Russell Brand, who did the VMAs, he went after the Jonas Brothers because they wear 
[01:55:00]  promise rings, Louie.  They wear promise rings?  Yeah, these promise rings, you're fruits.  These promise rings, you basically tell mommy and daddy, I promise not to have sex until  I'm married, I guess.  And then you wear a ring.  Why are you making sexually related promises to your parents?  To your parents.  It's creepy.  It's the creepiest friggin' thing. 
[01:55:30]  It just shouldn't be a conversation.  Well, it's a huge debate now because Russell Brand made fun of the whole thing and the Jonas  Brothers, and now the Today Show is talking about this.  Now they're debating teaching teens about sex.  Promise to wait?  Yuck.  That's not that...  You know, here's the thing.  They always tell teens, like, it's wrong or you're, you know, gonna die.  Yeah.  Just tell them the truth.  Like, you're gonna feel awful.  You're just gonna feel crappy the next...  If you don't care about the person, you have sex with them, you just... 
[01:56:00]  Parents should tell the stories of the people they've woken up next to.  The crappy, though, feeling the next morning, it's weighed, it's on a little teeter-totter  with how great it feels at the time.  Sure.  So...  Yeah, that's life.  I don't think...  And the promise ring thing, here's the deal with that.  You could put on a ring or not have the ring on.  These kids that are putting them on aren't having sex until they're having sex.  The ring has nothing to do with it. 
[01:56:30]  No, no.  It's just, yeah, I made a promise.  Right up until you get it, you know, offered to you.  And then you...  Forget about it.  You're gonna be, where'd you lose the ring?  Oh.  Oh.  I mean, funny.  Ironic.  It's very ironic where I lost the ring, Dad.  You wouldn't...  You don't even want to know, Dad.  There's gonna be a promise plink in the toilet.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  A promise plink.  By the way, if you want to stop me from having sex, make him wear a promise propeller hat.  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Right.  No, and it was weird because the ring was clanging around with a bunch of other ones.  Yeah.  Just heard a clank.  One day it pays off like a slot machine.  Oh, God.  Just click, click, click, click.  A wedding band, a charm bracelet, two pennies.  Some local...  Breast knuckles.  What have you been doing, Leslie?  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Breaking a lot of promises.  Opie and Dopey.  The degenerate tune of talk radio in the morning. 
[01:57:30]  Opie and Dopey.  FM ruling the house because they're foul-mouthed.  Fuck shit, cunt, motherfucker.  Feeble-minded.  And freaking morons.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony show.  What did I play last time?  I played that diary song, right?  Yeah, that was good.  That went over very well.  I went back to that book of diaries that I was telling you about, and I found another really beautiful entry.  Okay.  So, now I think every song is going to be the new bowling.  No!  Will you stop? 
[01:58:00]  There's a new diary entry that I thought was a really remarkable one, so I set it to music.  Okay.  Dear diary, today was a great day.  I bought myself a brand new horse.  She's strong and fast and so very beautiful.  And just a little wild, of course. 
[01:58:30]  I know tomorrow I can tame her.  If I only believe, wish me luck diary, Christopher E.  I just, I thought it was a really lovely way of expressing his love of the animal.  I haven't heard from him recently, so I don't know what's been going on, but I thought the sentiment was really nice.  Sweet!  I had no idea where you were going with that, too. 
[01:59:00]  That's really funny, man.  I took a ride one day, my horse to ease my troubled mind.  I hadn't landed a decent role since I met somewhere in time.  I couldn't get a job unless I wore a blue and red suit.  I felt there's nothing I could do.  Then suddenly my horse stopped short that stupid thoroughbred. 
[01:59:30]  My hands were tangled and the bright iron landed right on my head.  I couldn't tell that I had done some major harm.  Cause now I can't feel my legs or my arms. 
[02:00:00]  If I fell off my horse, would you still call me Superman?  I broke two vertebrae and I'm never gonna walk again.  The only things I move are my lips and eyes.  Cause I'm paralyzed.  I once was strong, but now I'm weak. 
[02:00:30]  I need a straw so I can eat.  I took for granted how easily I used to get around.  I drool and stare here in my chair and I can't even brush my hair.  And when I try to speak, I make these gargling sounds.  If I fell off my horse, would you still call me Superman?  Now I breathe through a tube attached to an ox that you can.  I sound like Blair's cut and Jerry from the facts of life. 
[02:01:00]  Cause I'm here with life.  I'm here with life. 
[02:01:30]  If I fell off my horse, would you still call me Superman?  Will you please wipe my butt?  Cause I no longer have use of my hands.  They hope I'll walk again if I exercise.  But I'm paralyzed.  Yeah!  If I fell off my horse, would you still call me Superman? 
[02:02:00]  I used to drive a Porsche, but now I have a handicap man.  I'm surprised my wife's not banging other guys.  Cause I'm paralyzed.  Hey everybody, it's Stephen Lynch.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And also, I have herpes.  Hit me!  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn!  I emptied another box in my apartment overnight.  And I brought in and made a lot of people laugh. 
[02:02:30]  Especially these newbies.  Not that they're newbies, cause they've been around a while.  But I actually brought in a box of carts.  And half the guys that work for the Opie and Anthony show looked at them like,  What is that strange thing?  I looked at them and went,  Wow, I remember those.  Like, I remember the labels on them and everything.  Yeah, and E-Rock goes,  Do you want these back?  I'm like,  I don't have a cart machine in my apartment.  Who's got a cart machine?  But they're legendary.  Cause they're the actual carts of bits and music beds and stuff that a lot of the hardcore fans remember like yesterday. 
[02:03:00]  We should maybe just sign the carts and hand them out to people that come in and check out the show on the bleachers.  You know what you should do, though, first?  Where are they?  Where are the carts?  Are they here?  You should stack them up and, like, fiddle around with them.  And people will remember hearing that on the radio.  Oh, okay.  Because remember when you used to hear carts?  You don't hear it anymore.  It's just something you don't hear in the background of radio anymore.  Yeah.  You hear, like, CDs and stuff. 
[02:03:30]  But carts made, I remember growing up listening to radio, carts made such a distinct sound on the air.  I think the famous cart scene is, didn't Howard knock over a bunch of carts?  Wasn't that a stack of carts?  I believe it was.  Carts and they fell onto the turntable.  Yeah.  In private parts.  Do we have that, Cliff?  Yeah.  I gotta say, that movie did have a couple of funny moments.  This was one of them. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, that's carts.  That's the sound of carts falling.  Why was he panicking like that?  I only saw it years ago.  The music was on the turntable.  It was an old, you know, turntable thing.  And the carts fell right onto the record that was spinning.  He was a nervous mess.  That was the part of the movie where he was just a nervous mess.  That was funny.  That was funny.  So we got this breaking news and then whatever was on the carts, they put on a nice little CD for us so we could go down memory lane. 
[02:04:30]  We could easily be throwing ourselves under the old bus because I have no idea.  I see a lot of these things and I think they're all good stuff, but I don't know.  I really don't know.  So you want to just listen to them?  Could this be painful again or is this going to be?  By the way, I finally unearthed the box of Real Rock TV.  Yeah.  VHS tapes.  Those will be coming soon. 
[02:05:00]  And I also gave a box of tapes to Sam and he found the time we gave away the shit car in Boston.  The news report.  Okay, good.  I'm hoping we have that ready for tomorrow.  If Sam's listening, I'm hoping.  It's the news report of a really bad promotion we did in Boston.  I think the first time we got negative publicity.  And I think I also have the...  Spudz Bookly?  The report on WOW that they did up there.  Oh yeah, that scumbag.  With the fucking asshole that came in with an earring like he's the coolest dude in the world.  Hey guys, this is great. 
[02:05:30]  Show us a little something.  Yeah.  He was trying to like...  He was all dressed down, like t-shirt and jeans and stuff.  And he had the camera crew and the mic and he's like getting sound bites.  And we were all caught up in the moment because we were stupid and didn't know that the news  was a bunch of fucking scumbags.  And we're just telling them how cool tits are.  We're offering them way too much.  A lot of info.  And these girls are barely legal.  Oh, it's fantastic.  And people drive and you almost crash your fucking car because you're like looking at tits. 
[02:06:00]  Let us tell you how rock and roll we are.  We're secretly hoping one of these dopes crashes because they don't give us more publicity.  Just being completely eager assholes, not having a clue what the news was all about.  And then here comes airtime.  Here comes airtime for the news.  All of a sudden, his earring is gone.  He's in a suit and tie, standing on the side of the road going,  The danger of a promotion from a radio station.  It's like, wait, where's the guy with the t-shirt that was laughing with us? 
[02:06:30]  And basically he's like, and here are the dopes that are responsible for this.  I gotta find that.  Fucking scumbag.  Sam was all hanging out with us.  Yeah, he was pretty much drinking beers with us.  Flirting with the girls that were in studio that day.  I remember bringing a girl down on my shoulders and they were videotaping it.  Remember that?  We took some girl and we were in the elevator and she got on my shoulders as we walked out  because it was going to look cool for the news if I had some topless chick on my shoulders. 
[02:07:00]  So we walk out and the news is like, yeah, that's great.  Oh, meanwhile, we just got crucified.  This was 96.  I remember we were onto something because people started hanging out in this parking lot in  Westboro, Massachusetts in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Yeah.  And they would drink beers.  I remember there was a bus, like a party bus, and they're on top of the bus just cranking  out the fucking show.  And we're in an office park where there's regular Joes going to work and everyone hated 
[02:07:30]  us.  And all of a sudden it became like this Grateful Dead thing.  People just started hanging out in the parking lot, checking out the show and picking up chicks  and stuff.  Just drinking.  Because the loose women would come and they would just be flashing every guy and girl going  in and out of the building that had regular jobs.  And I'm like, God damn, I think we got something here.  Anyway, so I brought in some old carts and let's see what we got.  We start with this.  Oh, boy.  Hopefully Sam will have that news report by tomorrow.  Both of those news reports for tomorrow would be great.  Ship down memory lane. 
[02:08:00]  Holy loose lips.  Holy conversations.  Hi, this is Burt Ward Robin.  If you want the best in big talk and small talk, listen to Opie and Anthony on WAAF 107.3,  the only station that really rocks.  That was Robin from the Batman series.  That was in a box in my apartment.  I've been carrying that around for 10, 12 fucking years.  Why?  If you need something really big, just look under my underpants. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, apparently.  There's a fat cock buried under two pairs.  I know what that was about.  When celebrities started doing IDs for our show and just mentioning our name, I thought  that was the coolest thing.  So I had to save all that.  Now it's like, ah, whatever.  Yeah, go fucking say our names in a studio somewhere.  But I saved the actual cart.  Here's Burt Ward, man.  That is cool, though, to have, man.  I think that's fucking cool to have.  But you know what?  I'm giving them away.  We'll sign them and just give them to whoever. 
[02:09:00]  If you want a cart, come check out the show tomorrow.  That's right.  And if not, don't.  There you go.  And then, of course, we've been looking for this for years.  I think it's just a music bed, but it'll bring back some memories.  Whoa.  Damn you.  Charlton Heston's bed.  Damn you wrong.  Oh, wait.  I got an actual one.  Is it an actual?  I got an actual one, man.  Charlton Heston bit?  Oh, wow.  Okay. 
[02:09:30]  This is when we first came back to New York.  It's Anthony doing Charlton Heston traffic.  Ah, yes.  Used to do Charlton Heston traffic.  Ew.  Hey, it was fun.  Why is it okay?  No.  Okay.  Keep that music, though, because we needed that one day, right?  Yes.  Yeah, I got the actual.  I think this is just the bed right here.  My cold, dead hands.  That's just the bed, yeah.  That'll be just the bed, but this is what Anthony did with it, which, I mean, people at 
[02:10:00]  NAW that walked the halls loved this bit.  Charlton Heston traffic.  Charlton Heston traffic.  Damn you all.  Damn.  Damn all.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Lord Almighty, why?  I am begged of thee to no avail. 
[02:10:30]  Your children continue to suffer.  Why have you abandoned them, God?  Damn you.  Is it not enough they slaved through the day?  Why have your merciful hands not touched upon them, God?  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  My eyes are pained as I behold the journey of tears that is the FDR drive.  Have they not suffered enough, God?  Damn you.  They are massed together as are the stones of the Great Pyramid, not a space between them 
[02:11:00]  to breathe.  Why, God?  Damn.  Damn, Lord.  Can you not hear them?  The sorrowful wails that they're stranded in the darkness of the Lincoln Tunnel?  Doth the murky waters block their cries from your ears, God?  Damn you.  Why do you test their faith so?  Do thine eyes deceive me?  Rubber-necking on the outbound Queensborough Bridge?  God, no.  Why?  What pleasure does one receive stealing a fleeting glance at a fallen brother, only to torture 
[02:11:30]  those who follow you there but for the grace of God?  Damn you, sinners!  Sinners!  I cast my staff across these waters and lead my flock home.  Follow me in the name of God Almighty!  Follow!  Damn you!  Damn you all!  Damn you all! 
[02:12:00]  Holy shit, we used to write for this show.  Remember when we used to write?  I remember that.  Was that actually...  Writing's stupid now.  Produced?  Yeah, there was a little bit of production there.  Wow.  It actually meant staying after the show for a few minutes.  Yeah, for a couple of minutes.  What do you guys think of the Charlton Heston traffic?  It's good.  Oh, of course.  Not bad, right?  Wonderful.  Great old bit. 
[02:12:30]  I carry with me.  This next one goes back to...  I acquired this when I was doing a show for BAB.  Ah.  Playing some of the carts that I found in a box in my apartment.  Another box unemptied.  Still got about ten of these to go, by the way.  This bit will last for, I don't know, who knows, a few more months.  Oh no, I remember this.  Oh God.  And it makes the cart sound of a broken cart. 
[02:13:00]  Well, they've been trying to transfer these all morning long.  They're like, man, these carts are in bad shape.  Yeah.  Condom man, condom man, condom man, does whatever a condom can.  Fits a richer than any size.  When you rise, condomize.  Look out.  Here comes the condom man.  Pregnancy and disease.  These are both his enemies. 
[02:13:30]  He is strong.  Oh my God.  He can hold an eight ounce rod.  Hey there.  There goes the condom man.  In the heat of the night, when she's about to blow your mind.  This latex superhero will arrive just in time.  Condom man, condom man.  Friendly neighborhood condom man.  Most of the time, he's ignored.  Action is his reward to him. 
[02:14:00]  Whenever there's a hang up.  Wherever someone's hung.  You'll find the condom man.  What do you think, Jimmy?  I like it a lot.  Condom man thing.  The wad line was my favorite.  The what?  The wad line.  The wad line.  Is this boring people, you think?  What?  It's the old school stuff.  They don't know what they're going to hear.  It's just a box of carts that I found and brought in today. 
[02:14:30]  God, am I a fat cunt?  This next one, I have no idea what it is.  This is the first one I have no idea what we're going to hear.  It could be douche chili.  I have no clue.  It's labeled crybaby.  Crybaby.  Let me think.  Oh, fuck.  Crybaby.  Crybaby.  Anyone?  We should play Guess What This Is.  Yeah, Guess What This Is.  Crybaby.  Okay.  We got a lot of...  It's Crybaby?  It says Crybaby on the cart.  42 seconds.  Played it a lot.  Enough that I saved it in a box for many years. 
[02:15:00]  Crybaby.  Crybaby.  Someone's saying, holy crap, you guys were hacks.  Yeah.  And this is coming in a lot.  Pretty hacky.  They're now typing this.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Someone's saying this is an off day for us.  I do not think that is true.  Shit it!  All right.  Here is Crybaby.  Oh.  It's just a Crybaby.  Oh.  Oh, we used to play that when someone on the phone would start like giving us shit or crying 
[02:15:30]  or whining.  Yeah, not all of these are going to be gems.  This is what we had handy when we were talking about Howard.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Fair is fair.  We would just play this in the background and then read how we were just...  I don't know.  Whatever.  We don't have to play the whole thing.  No shit.  That is disturbing.  It's all right. 
[02:16:00]  Don't be so upset.  I'm showing you how to be an adult.  Oh, God.  Come here.  I got some sardine oil for you.  Sardine oil.  Kids love sardine oil.  Yeah.  Have some cotton candy for Brevkus.  You're such a creep. 
[02:16:30]  You want a dark ice, you kiss?  All right.  Bit over.  Bit over.  Huh?  All right.  So far, we're not minding any gold here.  What?  What happened?  Oh, okay.  What do you whisper?  Here's the next cart.  Box of carts found.  Brought them in to see what these are all about.  And here we go.  Oh.  I remember this one.  Darth Vulgar, everyone.  That was Darth Vulgar? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, Darth Vulgar.  Jesus, we were hacks.  I am Darth...  Huh?  Maybe he cursed.  Well, I remember this bit.  We got in trouble because the bleeps weren't good enough.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little too close on the bleeps.  For back in the day.  I am Darth Vulgar.  Defy me and get a boot up your ass.  I'm Princess Leia.  Buff my helmet.  R2D2.  Shut up, you overgrown butt plug. 
[02:17:30]  I am Darth Vulgar.  Luke, I am your father.  Your mother was the worst f*** I ever had.  If she gave good h***, you wouldn't even be here.  I don't even believe it.  When she dropped her pants, it looked like she had a Wookiee and a leg lock.  Lando Carissi, we meet again.  Shouldn't you be sitting in the back of the ship, you f***?  And you, Jabba the Hutt, you fat bastard.  You can't even see your d*** anymore, can you? 
[02:18:00]  I am Darth Vulgar.  Yoda, make like a gerbil and crawl upon Solo's a**.  You look like a scrotum with ears.  My balls are as big as the Death Star.  Obi-Wan, you limp d***, go f***.  You can't even get it up anymore.  Have you played that?  I am Darth Vulgar, motherf***er of the universe.  I think that's, that got played on regular radio. 
[02:18:30]  I think that's more fun for us, because, holy shit.  There was a time that, there wasn't any beefs.  But there was a time in radio, just to bring inside a little bit, where that's all they  asked for, was to bleep the word a little bit.  Yeah.  So just the slightest bleep made it FCC friendly.  That was okay.  And then somewhere along the line, you had to bleep out the entire word.  Yeah.  You couldn't use the, you couldn't use the f***.  The bleep becomes part of the word.  Right.  It's like, f***.  Yeah.  But that was legal.  Yeah.  That wasn't even us taking chances.  I remember that was actually legal. 
[02:19:00]  And then I remember when it came down, look, now you got to bleep the entire word.  And I remember you and I were just so hours like, come on, what the f***?  That's bulls***, man.  Man.  Man.  It's the man coming down on his man.  Well, the reviews are coming in.  Tim from Columbus, Ohio writes, hmm, it's good.  I mean, it's no bra bomb or anything, but it's okay.  Fuck.  This is really old stuff.  I like Darth Vulgar, though.  Darth Vulgar?  Who wouldn't? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Ew.  Ew.  Boo.  Boo.  Someone, G-Baby saying, bring back Darth Vulgar.  Oh, yeah.  Can you bring back Darth Vulgar?  Please.  Um, no.  Darth Vulgar is dead.  Why?  Because.  Someone's like, way to go.  Way to bleep those U's.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  Yeah, I know.  That is f***ing funny, man.  Because.  Motherf***er of the universe.  Basically, motherfucker was on the radio.  Motherf***er.  Oh.  You want the next one?  You bet I do. 
[02:20:00]  This one's really hacky, because you see, my name's Opie, so I would collect like, uh.  Oh, no.  Opie bits.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  All right, moving on to the next one.  Hey, no, you gotta play that.  What the f*** was that?  Come on.  Play that.  By the way, I don't know if this guy is f***ing with me, but someone who's in the know, by the  way, it's not just some listener that's f***ing with us, swears that he's in possession 
[02:20:30]  of four Spuds Buckley bits.  Wow.  Where is he?  Where is this mystery man?  Come on.  He wrote me.  He's gonna end up dead by Opie's hands.  He wrote me, and I didn't even acknowledge that I got his email, so.  What's his email address?  I don't remember.  We can email him.  I'm so nervous, man.  That will be the end of this dumb looking back on the good old days bit.  All right, here we go.  So remember, Opie, so I'm collecting Opie bits. 
[02:21:00]  Oh.  In an alley behind Main Street, rockin' and rollin', he pulls the rope and starts the pullin'.  There's blood in his eyes, he starts on his spree to dismember the town of Mayberry.  Over on Elm, Thelma Loose in the kitchen, got her needle and thread out to do some stitchin'. 
[02:21:30]  A knock on the back door.  Who could that be?  As she hears the sound of her destiny.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, I wonder who the killer could be.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, in Mayberry RFD.  Gomer and Goober at the fill-in station, about to get themselves an education. 
[02:22:00]  Gomer's pumpin' gas, Goober's out of camp, when all of a sudden...  Shazam!  Surprise!  Bobby's car gets a flat in the rain.  Back in the trunk, our hero oils his chain.  As he pops the latch to the spare of the deck.  He's been terrible, I'm sorry.  He finds his next for a big hack attack.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, I wonder who the killer could be.  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, in Mayberry RFD.  Boring! 
[02:22:30]  Bobby's at home, so is Aunt B.  Wondering who the Chainsaw Killer could be.  They hear a knock.  Hey, maybe it's Paul.  But as they turn to look, they both get the...  Boo!  Andy's at the barbershop, opens the door, finds a bit more than they bargained for.  As he sits in the chair, she'll wait, says with a grin.  Glenn, you can come through.  Shut up!  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, I wonder who the killer could be. 
[02:23:00]  At the Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, in Mayberry RFD.  Is anybody with an umbrella?  The Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, I wonder who the killer could be.  At the Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, in Mayberry RFD.  It's the Mayberry Chainsaw Massacre, I wonder who the killer could be.  Kyle S. from Indiana, he writes, how did you ever get this one on regular radio?  Boo!  Boo!  That is awful.  Can I interest you in a haircut?  All right, you get it. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, he's going to kill her.  Florida Steve from Washington, D.C. writes, holy Casio keyboard pit, Batman.  Wait, where'd it go?  Fuck.  Is this from a radio comedy pit service?  Yeah, that one actually was.  Oof.  Prep Burger?  Yeah, I think it was Prep Burger.  It's a taxi, change, all that is it.  RFD, shut up.  Can I interest you in a haircut?  He means with the chainsaw.  Right.  Sure, if you cut this bit first. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, this is Chaz Palminteri.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let the show die, then.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  They should be shot.  All right, hey, so I brought carts in yesterday, another box that I unpacked in my apartment  there, and still so much other stuff to bring in. 
[02:24:30]  I brought in the tape of us giving away that awful car in Boston.  That was fun.  Yeah.  We got a lot of props for that from the staff at K-Rock over there.  Oh, really?  They were coming to work.  They're like, dude, that was really funny because we can all relate to giving the listeners  some piece of shit and make them believe it's good.  And then just telling them to go the fuck away.  Oh, la, la, la, la.  The la, la, la.  Oh, here he comes again.  Oh, no.  Oh, look who it is, everybody.  Not this character.  Oh, you're a character. 
[02:25:00]  No.  Do you think people at home are like, oh, Spuds Buckley's coming in.  This is my favorite part of the show.  I love this.  Stop.  Spuds Buckley's on.  No, I don't.  No, you don't.  Douche.  What a douche he was.  I don't.  Oh, if you only had a fucking time machine.  Oh, man, I'd give him testicular cancer.  Would you?  No problem.  No fucking problem.  I would probably, if I could get into a time machine, I'd go back.  Go back.  I'd find Spuds Buckley, who is a young version of me, and I would fuck myself in the ass. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  Wow.  You would fuck yourself in the ass.  And it's not gay because you're fucking yourself in the ass.  It's yourself.  It's your own ass.  It's your own life jerking off.  Right.  But Spuds Buckley would be like, you would know because you went into the time machine.  Right.  But he wouldn't know.  No.  Because he hadn't gotten to that point yet.  So he just thinks he's being ass raped.  Right.  And you're just having fun, and it's a goof for you.  Yeah.  Waking him up.  Yeah.  So maybe he could develop a little faster so he doesn't have to stay in these shithole markets  year after fucking year. 
[02:26:00]  Maybe that's what happened to him.  That's why his voice was like that.  It is like, how do you get so much from four seconds, you fuckers?  It's just so bad.  That's how bad it is.  I thought that was an hour.  Dude, that's at least the beginning of one to two minutes of material.  And that's all you get today. 
[02:26:30]  Because that's the brilliance of me.  Oh, my goodness.  Good morning, Bear Man.  Good morning, Bear Man.  Oh, no.  Here go the ratings.  Oh, Spuds, you've done it again.  It's true.  Done a lot.  Sucked.  Another piece tomorrow.  Hey, let it be known that Dark Vulgar has 874,000 views on Newgrounds.com.  I forgot.  Wow.  That thing was animated a while ago. 
[02:27:00]  Dan Milkman.  That's amazing.  My Vista has 2,500,000 views, by the way.  Yeah, because you got into the whole geek culture thing.  Yeah, I did.  I really hit a nerve with that one.  It's some of my best work.  We really got to get an animated TV show.  I hope HBO's listening to our play.  How fucking great would that be?  It's a no-brainer at this point.  Funny as motherfucker, I think.  People love these animations.  Hey, so you want to hear more stuff in the carts I brought in?  Sure do. 
[02:27:30]  Really old shit.  So keep that in mind.  This next one we did about almost 10 years ago.  Ant and I used to drive into work.  Yes.  And Ant was such a crazy driver that we decided to start taping our commutes into the fine  city of Manhattan.  And people love this bit.  Yeah, it was not mornings either.  Afternoon drive.  It was afternoon, so there was a lot of traffic and it just sucked.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  And I had this bit because we wanted to play it a lot on cart.  Here it is.  Cart.  Look at all the kids coming to see Daddy.  Come on.  Oh my God.  Okay.  That's us driving by the prison.  Yeah, that's right.  I always thought it was little boys walking into Ant's house.  That's what he called himself.  Y'all coming to see Daddy.  Yeah.  That's before I left the house.  Oh.  Oh, wow. 
[02:28:30]  Maybe the black.  This is a guy that knows how to linger longer.  Maybe the black guy.  This is Matt Lamb from the city.  Maybe the black guy in Buffalo was Ope in blackface going back in time to fuck himself  in the ass.  Hey.  Wow.  That could have been you.  And then he gives me a linger boo boo boo.  He had to go through the chimney.  That's why.  Maybe he landed in the chimney.  Yeah.  And it was soot.  Sooty.  You got a little sooty.  I should have known, man.  That whole rape thing that almost happened to me. 
[02:29:00]  God damn it.  That was me going back in a time machine.  I didn't even know.  That means at some point you are going to find a time machine.  Right.  But if you are going to, why don't you just.  Well, now I'm going to do it right.  Come back now and say something to yourself.  Right.  Like what?  Just to prove that, you know.  Oh.  I don't know.  Walk in.  Spuds.  Say la la la.  La la la.  Good morning.  Oh, no.  Good gravy.  That's some madcap fun.  Shut up. 
[02:29:30]  Madcap.  Oh, boy.  Strap in, folks.  Give me one of those days.  He's here again.  That's crazy.  He's incorrigible.  La la la.  And by incorrigible, I mean completely unfunny.  Hello, bear man.  That should be followed by a gunshot.  Do you have one in the replay?  I'm laughing because I don't want to cry.  Laugh.  Let me see something here. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  I would love to hear that.  This is my impression of that day.  La la la la la.  Good morning, bear man.  Hey, I'm getting props.  Bobby D from Brockton writes,  I just hope he needs to sue the creators of Spongebob  for stealing his Spuds Buckley voice.  Yeah.  See?  I was an innovator.  You know who's giving you props?  Spuds B from Buffalo.  Stupid Spuds Buckley. 
[02:30:30]  You know who should give you props?  A Cessna 180.  Or Carrot Top.  Here, improve that bitch.  All right, here's us driving to work.  The first comment was us driving by a prison  as they're waiting in line to go in and see Daddy.  Look at all the kids going to see Daddy.  Come on.  Oh, that woman has no teeth.  No teeth.  Sweetie, you need a burger.  Oh, my God. 
[02:31:00]  Look at that.  Oh.  That guy's got to be guilty of something.  What up, G?  What up?  Never seen one with blonde hair.  Jesus.  Oh, look at this.  That's the same f*** that would be honking  if you were in his way in a green light.  Look at these a**holes.  Look at this guy.  Hit him.  Oh, my God.  I'd ram right into the side of him. 
[02:31:30]  Would have made that light.  Billie Jean King called.  She wants her hairstyle back.  My lane here.  My lane.  A**hole.  Now you don't get in.  F*** you.  Hey, Fabio.  See that guy?  I cannot believe it's not about the wall.  Look at up there.  Where?  Coming up from behind there.  That's a dude.  Oh, it's shut up.  That guy's got the biggest s*** I've ever seen.  Yay.  No.  You think we're playing up to the f***ing recorder? 
[02:32:00]  Not at all.  Oh, my God.  I can't listen to this s***.  Why?  It's very organic dialogue on the way to work.  But there's two geniuses riffing.  It happens every day on the way to work.  This is why.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  What?  The geniuses riffing.  This is why when they have those discussions on the fan sites,  they were so much better at any W.  I laugh inside because I know it's not true. 
[02:32:30]  Because listen to this.  People remember this as a really good bit.  I had to stop the tape.  It's not a good bit.  No.  We were playing up to the recording.  You could hear.  When you know you're being recorded,  you're not just going to sit there and drive like you normally would.  No, I disagree.  I think it sounded.  I felt like I was a fly on the wall.  Just listening to two people.  More like a fly on a pile of s***.  Just listening to two people who comment comedically constantly.  Who's that guy?  Look at that fat guy.  Get out of here.  Who's that car? 
[02:33:00]  Nice car.  Hey, there's rust on that one.  Look how tall that building is.  It was just nonstop improvisations.  What a ride into work.  How'd you have anything left for the air?  Oh, God.  You suck.  That is so funny.  Constantly.  My new catchphrase is,  fuck you,  add name here.  Fuck you,  G-Baby.  Can't you believe it's not Butter Ope?  Can't you?  And then,  Smokezilla.  I can't believe it's not talent. 
[02:33:30]  And fucking Jared from Rochester.  Did you guys...  I don't know, dude.  Hold on.  Did you guys have a blimp in the back of the truck?  Just in case we had to take off and bomb a building with bra bombs.  I wish we had the audio of the guy knocking the mirror off the side of my car.  I don't.  Rod J.  From Colorado Springs.  Wait, can we hear more of the organic dialogue?  Sure.  Just keeping in mind,  this is two guys driving to work 
[02:34:00]  who comment on everything at every moment.  But we were so much better  when we were on NAW.  What the fuck is this?  Hold on, man.  John and Ope.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to see if Ope could do  his awesome impression of Fabio again.  I can't believe it's not...  He's right.  I'm going to hack my entire career. 
[02:34:30]  Let's go to Sean, North Carolina.  Sean?  That guy's got the biggest tips.  Anthony's there.  Why didn't you stop and give A-Roc a live?  What the hell?  I think that guy did something wrong.  Look at that.  He's got blonde hair.  Big tits for a guy.  Ben-a-bam-bam-bam-bam.  Just riffing on the way to work.  Yeah, just riffing.  Yeah, just laughs on wheels.  So, charity, we ride our bus into your town  and just make you laugh all the way home organically. 
[02:35:00]  Just riffing organically.  Mongo, what's up?  Sounds like Spuds Buckley got hit with the sword of the gate.  Two T-cells, two T-cells.  I hated that until he did the two T-cells line.  Yeah.  And now I don't.  Let's say hi to Dave in Tennessee.  See, they picked right up on it.  Dave?  Hey, good morning, guys.  I just wanted to hear more from you crazy motherhuckers  on the way to work.  Crazy motherhuckers.  All right, here's us just riffing, you know, 
[02:35:30]  because we're that damn good.  What are we doing?  Yay.  No, no.  Just go home.  I'll let you go.  You can go anywhere.  Wax on, wax off.  Oh, why are we stomping?  Come on.  Look at this.  It's the way it happens.  Oh, come on.  Maybe they drive like that in Bangladesh, not here.  See?  It's funny.  I'll take off your top.  Yeah, you eat that ice cream.  Oh, God damn.  Wow.  Thank God there was a crowd of people 
[02:36:00]  that commented on every single,  never a dull moment.  That's what the name of this is.  Never a dull moment.  It was just constant excitement.  Oh, my God.  And something to comment on.  And talking about,  this is how you know it's organic,  because people always go,  ah, darn, slowing down, 25, 24, 23.  Why are we stopping again?  Yellow light, red light, green light.  It's like these people were lined up for our amusement. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  It's perfectly lined up.  You got the black guy with the blonde hair.  You got the fat bitch, the skinny bitch.  You got the gay guy.  You got the Bangladesh guy.  Bangladesh cab driver.  You got the Asian kid.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Take off your top.  Yeah, you eat that ice cream.  Boja jokes, you know.  Out of the way.  Coming through.  Oh, this is awful.  My lane.  My lane.  Out of the way.  Ah, you f***ing a**hole. 
[02:37:00]  I was wrong.  Holy Jesus.  I'll get you, my pretty.  And you little dog, too.  What is that?  What was that for?  What is that?  I have no f***ing idea.  What?  Awful.  Was that for?  Horrid.  It was obviously an older lady that looked like, you know, the witch.  Oh, God.  I wouldn't care if it was the witch.  Why?  The only sound I want to hear is this truck crashing and the crackling of our fat burning. 
[02:37:30]  This is terrible.  No, what sound you should hear?  The sound of a f***ing train car striking a motor vehicle.  Like a train horn and the car just f***ing broadsiding the car.  The only authentic thing on that tape would be our screams.  Yes.  That would be good.  Oh, hey.  Is that a train?  Ha, ha, hopi.  Wah, wah.  What was the name of the f***ing movie?  Crazy Mary something Larry?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nothing's going to stop us now. 
[02:38:00]  Right, right, right.  Yeah, and then the train gets him.  Well, Matt LaFarre from Queensbury.  Yeah.  He writes, two guys, one douche chill.  And then you get, this is a linger longer.  The guy writes, no wonder you and Ant drove around after work and never wanted to go home.  Constant natural hilarity.  Absolutely.  Why get out of that?  Why get out of that nut house?  Really?  It's just funny shit happening everywhere.  Are you kidding me?  You got B Car from Orange County writes, such natural dialogue.  Hey, Ant, you're in my f***ing car.  Wow, what's the name of that show we were watching? 
[02:38:30]  It's called Everyone's Fodder.  You ready for more?  I could not be more ready.  What the hell is he looking at?  Hey, everyone, it's Arsenio Hall.  Arsenio?  Hey, it's Gary Coleman.  Watch out, he'll punch you in the knee. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, look here.  Here we go.  Please tell me you both just realized what you were doing.  Oh, my God.  There was our release, yeah.  Everyone has to drink.  Open the impression.  Yeah, someone's suggesting, Chad from L.A. 
[02:39:30]  Benny Hill should be playing in the background.  Oh, my God.  Look at these things.  Socks full of sand.  Sacky tits, I guess.  Oh, just keep going through red lights.  Keep going.  Pickle aid!  Put me off so you can just stop.  You f***ing d***.  Pickle aid!  Oh, my God.  Hey, look, it's the frugal gourmet.  Hey, molested boys, lay lay.  Hey, frugal gourmet.  I think that actually was him.  It looked like. 
[02:40:00]  That's it.  Just walk in the road.  Doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  Look at the fossil getting out of this car.  Jesus.  Oh.  Life.  Hug.  Come on.  Come on.  Just go.  No one in front of you.  What a d***.  You can't pick up a fair d*** in the middle of the road, you f***ing a**hole.  Holy s***.  He's stopping in the left turn lane.  Oh, my God.  It's Link from the Mock Squad.  Just in case you didn't know.  Where?  What did I do? 
[02:40:30]  We're almost there.  Make this light.  Make this light.  Come on.  We're one block away.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Natural conversation.  Absolutely.  Coming through.  No wonder you guys decided to take this.  Oh, it ain't out.  Coming through.  Yeah.  We made it.  It stopped.  Sanctuary.  It's good to know that our commute took three minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  Three minutes from our guy.  That's a short break.  That's just amazing.  The commute took just enough time to fit between songs. 
[02:41:00]  And the amazing thing is all of those laughs on a daily basis, both directions, why wouldn't  you get the tape recorder going?  What are we doing?  This gold is flying out the windows.  We're giving this gold to the dashboard.  What's the matter with us?  Cheap.  Cheap baby.  Cheap baby writes, fuck you, Jimmy.  Arsenio Hall whooping and then a midget punch in the knee joke.  Simply perfect humor.  And very naturalist.  The way you go back and forth.  Yeah, I know.  That's what it was.  Eric B. from New Hampshire.  Way to tag that zinger, Opie.  Watch out. 
[02:41:30]  He'll punch you in the knee.  Just a giant laughing box.  Four wheels on it.  And Philly fan writes, now I know where the car crash came from.  There should have been a tube from the exhaust pipe right into the window.  Jay Mansfield's wig should have fucking been at the end of that car ride.  Look, man.  What other radio show's brave enough to do this?  Oh, really?  Don't break out those pictures of yourself when you're 18.  Then you'll understand what we're going through here. 
[02:42:00]  Two douches, one car.  Yeah, thanks.  I bet you guys were sitting in a parked car.  The horn sounded like you were not moving.  Well, I beat my horn when I'm not moving.  Someone wants to know if I, this is Steve G, he writes, hey, did you say, hey, we made  it every time you guys got to work?  Yeah, I know, yeah.  Hey, we made it.  Very natural.  Because that's what you do when you pull up, you go, hey, we made it.  Billy S writes, make it better and tell everyone this bit was so old you were recording from 
[02:42:30]  a truck wagon.  Hey, we made it.  Oh, God.  Go, go, go.  Go to my lane.  I'm driving.  Now I'm driving.  I'm hitting the gas.  Oh, great.  Slow down.  Oh, great.  Yellow light.  Look at that guy.  Who is he?  Looks like Aunt Jemima.  Oh, great.  Going again.  Oh, my goodness.  Ricky Murphy from Massachusetts.  Knowing Opie, he probably hyped this for three days and replayed it all week.  I think we did.  Can I take you inside what just happened?  I'm ready to play this thing from these old cards. 
[02:43:00]  I swear I didn't listen ahead of time.  I'm listening to it cold like most people out there.  Cold as douche chills.  And I even remember thinking that, wow, this is a really good bit.  This is going to be cool to hear again.  And halfway through it, I'm like, oh, my God.  We got to turn the fucking mics on and acknowledge how hacky and awful this really is.  Oh.  Ugh.  Well, let's go.  Oh, no.  We just.  Let's go to cigars and scotch.  Cigars and scotch.  Yes.  I found more lost audio from this bit. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, OK.  Oh, hey, Anthony.  Watch this.  I'll tap the guy with my bumper and scare the shit out of him.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, cool.  We got to fucking crash cigars and scotch.  Yeah, I like that.  Let's go to Chris.  What's up, Chris?  Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  You talking to me?  Yeah.  Hey, man.  Fucking this is.  Jimmy, you're killing me tearing them a new asshole.  You're fucking hysterical.  I want to know, Jimmy.  Hey, could I hire you? 
[02:44:00]  Because I have a few people I need their assholes chewed.  And you would be a perfect.  You want me to chew their assholes?  They're fucking Chinese versions of yes.  No, I'm sorry.  I'm not a fucking.  I'm not a surprise boss.  I don't put on a suit and pretend I'm with the parent company and then start goofing and  doing abortion jokes.  Yes.  But thank you, sir.  I'm glad you're enjoying it.  We have another one from the old carts.  These are well over 10 years old for the most part. 
[02:44:30]  Remember?  Oh, how long ago did the Blair Witch Project come out?  Oh, my God.  Anyone?  Probably eight.  About 10 years ago?  Eight to 10 years ago?  Something like that?  Maybe 10?  Smud from Whackbag.  Surprised we didn't hear Opie telling people to back off, bro.  Oh, hey, we made it, brother man.  Yeah, we made it, mother heckers.  I wonder if George Burns would say this while he was driving. 
[02:45:00]  Right to me.  I feel sexy.  Oh, dude, it's inexcusable.  Pray for me.  Hey, we made it to the garage.  Yeah.  Say goodnight, Gracie.  Nine years, okay.  Nine years.  Oh, God.  Nine years ago for Blair Witch Project.  So, of course, we had to do our own version called Scared Shitless Project.  That's us going up into Harlem, you know.  Oh, is that it?  I have no idea what this is going to sound like.  I haven't heard this in nine years, whatever. 
[02:45:30]  Ew.  Well, hold on to your hats, kids.  Just more audio I found.  More hilarity.  More audio I found in these boxes that I thought was so, that these things were so good, I had  to carry them from apartment to apartment to apartment.  It all started with three college students in the haunted woods in Maryland.  And now it continues with two DJs in the streets of Harlem.  We're going to bring, like, a dat recorder and we're going to record our day in Harlem.  It was just supposed to be a goofy radio bit. 
[02:46:00]  I'll find the tape years later.  That's precisely what happened.  And this is what they found.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  What's that sound?  You cracker.  Get the fuck out of the motherfucking car, biatch.  Oh, my God.  Josh.  See what happens when Whitey goes to the hood? 
[02:46:30]  What?  It's a pile of crack pipes outside our tent.  What does it mean?  I'm sorry I came up here.  I'm sorry.  What is that?  Yeah, just a goofy radio bit.  What is that?  The Scared S***less Project.  You got to give out me and Anthony a lot of credit.  What was that? 
[02:47:00]  The first comment.  It didn't take long.  Jay Horror writes.  Okay.  He writes, the No Funny Project.  Why?  That was very good.  The black voice.  Oh, the black voice was great.  Yeah.  Who was that?  And someone writes, how did you get this job?  Was the XM interviewer deaf?  Wow. 
[02:47:30]  Holy Jesus.  You should put that bit up on Shitburger.  Bird in Philly writes, why don't you just put these things back in the box?  Were we ever good?  This is terrible.  I don't know.  I guess Bob is like probably the best agent ever.  What is he, Jedi mind trick these motherfuckers?  I'm now going to call him fucking Doug Henning Eatman. 
[02:48:00]  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  I only discovered you boys like two years ago.  Yeah.  Boy, did I dodge a bullet.  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  Do we have time for one more?  I hope not.  One more.  This is called the Schlong Song.  The Schlong Song?  It was on cart.  It's just bad, bad dick jokes. 
[02:48:30]  And like that.  Bum, ba-da-bum, bum, ba-da-bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  It was on cart, which means we thought enough of this that we wanted it handy to play.  At any given moment.  Wanted it right there at our fingertips.  Not funny.  Not funny.  Please no more, people are saying. 
[02:49:00]  Mutton, dagger, old blind bob, hanging johnny, fishing rod, tally, whacker, pocket, rocket, one-eyed trouser, trout.  Ding, dong, ankle spanker, pork, sword, engine, clanker, hairy, hot dog, Davey, crockett, let them all hang out.  Pet names for genitalia.  You know the girls pick up them and you've got to love them.  Pet names for genitalia.  There's always something silly about little Willie. 
[02:49:30]  Wang, wazoo, weenie, whacker, pecker, peepee, kidney, cracker, heat, seeking, moisture, missile, giggle, stick.  Love, whistle, tube, steak, uncle dick.  This is getting really sick.  I'm not through.  There's one more.  Purple helmet warrior.  Pet names for genitalia.  You know the girls pick up them and you've got to love them.  Pet names for genitalia.  There's always something silly about little Willie.  Pet names for genitalia. 
[02:50:00]  You know the girls pick up them and you've got to love them.  I can think of a pet name for genitalia if you're getting a couple of tools.  Two more.  Two more.  Opie, Anthony.  That's funny.  That damn has a line.  Opie, Anthony.  Oh, fuck.  Pet names for genitalia.  Something silly about little Willie.  So you douches out there that think we were better in the NAW days. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, you losing the argument today.  Oh, boy.  Have you lost the argument today?  Steve from Rockland has a good comment.  Yes, Steve.  Steve.  I have been a devoted fan for 12 years.  What the fuck was I thinking?  I hate these guys.  Nat Fanny.  Just Nat Fanny.  Awful.  Nat Fanny.  There's something silly about little...  What's silly?  Little Willie.  Come on, Jim.  Some silly names that you come up with. 
[02:51:00]  Sure.  Purple Helmet Warrior.  I guess we don't have time to play anymore, right?  That's good.  Shoehorned.  Shoehorned.  Warrior.  Warrior.  Warrior.  Calling.  It was a different time.  Yeah.  You know.  Yes, one devoid of humor.  And this is what kind of douches we were.  This is the kind of douches we were back then, too.  Because we're sitting there after every show going, God damn it, why haven't they syndicated  us yet?  We got exposed more people to the greatness of this radio show. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, that just hurts now.  What happened?  Cigars and Scotch.  Carol Miller was right.  Hey, this is David Tell.  I'm the new intern on the Opie and Anthony show.  Can I do this more cop-like?  Hey, this is David Tell.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  They suck.  Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to the worst.  Worst.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is the fucking worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:52:00]  That's pretty stupid.  Way before Anthony and I did our famous April Fool's prank that got us fired.  The first time.  Oh.  My second radio, by the way.  Because we all got fired when we were working in Buffalo back in the day because they, you  know, were bought out.  But anyway.  Spuds Buckley didn't save the day?  No.  There was a morning show, The Bear Man.  He's now heard in Allentown, Pennsylvania. 
[02:52:30]  Morning, Bear Man.  And his April Fool's prank was to come up with a parade.  And then people would call the station like, wow, where's this parade?  It sounds cool.  I want to check it out with my kids.  Well, the gag is there was never a parade.  But it sounded like there was an actual parade going through Buffalo.  And I was part of that bit that day.  Ooh.  As Spuds Buckley.  I just kept in.  The Fox Buffalo's home of quality.  Rock and Roll is 636.  Gracious.  Good morning.  You're on your way with The Bear Man.  We've got The Bear Man. 
[02:53:00]  We've got The Bear Man.  We're here at the, excuse me, at the reviewing stand for the first annual Fox Fool's Parade.  We're located just one half mile west of Furman Boulevard near Shooters.  And they're still working on kittens.  So you get the location and all of a sudden people show up and are like, hey, where's the parade?  And there's sound effects like they're building a reviewing stand or something.  Is that what they're doing?  Or a float?  What are they building?  Yeah.  As you're on it.  What is this, animal house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is the hammering in the background? 
[02:53:30]  Unless it's Spuds Buckley's head.  We're creating an illusion.  Spud Buckley's stink.  All you need is a hammer sound, you know, hammering a nail in and you create an illusion.  An illusion.  Yes.  Theater of the mind.  That's right.  Furman Boulevard near Shooters.  And they're still working on getting some of the barriers.  Some of these vendors we got over here, they want to know where the hell they're supposed to be.  Vendors, vendors, vendors, vendors.  Who's, where's, oh, what's they're going to be?  Well, la, la, la, la, la, la.  All right. 
[02:54:00]  Listen.  I was like, no, no, no.  You got it.  You got it.  I can't.  You got it.  I can't.  Yeah, I know.  Please.  I want.  Please.  Bobby, yes.  Just relish in it.  Please.  Please.  I want.  I can't.  What happened?  For the love of everything.  That's all.  He pushed that button.  What happened?  That was, you heard two seconds of Spuds Buckley, and now you just want to hear as much as  you can.  You haven't heard Spuds Buckley yet?  No, but did he have a hat with a propeller on top?  See?  It was that type of character.  I didn't, I didn't create this character be, like, cool. 
[02:54:30]  Oh.  It wasn't getting me the Buffalo Bettys.  You were like the nutty professor.  Like, like, one guy was like, and then the other one was Buddy Love, the crooner.  You had buck teeth in your pocket and Chinese, like, Asian guy glasses?  Dude, I've, nah, let me tell you something.  I would do a lot of stuff out in the streets, and I was too poor to get the proper outfit 
[02:55:00]  for Spuds Buckley.  So I would just, like, like, come up with stuff.  I have sweatpants, you know, and white basketball sneakers, and the sweatpants are tucked into  the white socks that are pulled up pretty high.  And then I got the, uh, the station jacket on, because it is Buffalo, and I'm freezing  my ass off.  And then I have, like, uh, like a do-rag on.  And are you making a la-la-la-la-la-la face?  No, I'm just, I'm doing a, uh, what's up, man, face.  Oh, my God. 
[02:55:30]  All right, let's play this.  Two swearzo.  What's the gonna be?  Well, la-la-la-la-la-la.  Oh, no, no.  Good morning, Bearman.  Ladies and gentlemen, put them together for Spuds.  Oh, Buckley.  Put them together.  Two mallets with his head between it.  You have to stop.  My ears almost fell off.  The two shivers just went up my back.  They almost shook my ears off.  Right?  Yeah, I, uh, you gotta remember, I was making 12 Gs.  This is, I'm being polite. 
[02:56:00]  12 large, huh?  I'm being polite.  This was at least, at least 15 years ago.  No, about 15 years ago.  You should have been making Governor Spitzer prostitute money to degrade yourself like that.  Uh, and I actually, uh, was, well, I told the story.  I was supposed to show up at a really nice outdoor, like, uh, club in Buffalo at Spuds  Buckley, and I'm there, and there's all these, like, you know, these hot chicks, and guys 
[02:56:30]  trying to pick up the hot chicks, and then I was supposed to be, like, the entertainment  and do a couple things and sell some beers, and I sat in my car and basically cried and  said, I can't do this.  Cried?  I can't do this.  Dude, I have suffered in this business.  And I never showed up, and it was a big client.  I believe it was, like, Budweiser or something.  I mean, it was a huge client, and I almost got fired.  And then I actually, I actually did cry in the general manager's office.  I'm like, look, I, I, I, you can't fire me.  I just couldn't do this. 
[02:57:00]  I, I was, I was mortified.  You had a life-changing moment in the, in the car, as Spuds Buckley?  In my Honda Accord that had close to 200,000 miles on it.  Did you go home?  In the parking lot of this really hip club that I was supposed to, like, make this  big appearance at Spuds Buckley.  Did you go home that night and take the outfit off and fold it up and put it in a suitcase  and put it up on the top shelf of a closet?  I think that's how this whole character ended.  I don't think I did it after that, because I just, I just kind of petered out.  Because the salespeople, they'll sell anything.  They're like, oh, this Spuds Buckley character. 
[02:57:30]  Apparently.  We got to, we got to have them doing appearances all over Buffalo.  And the first one, I sat in the parking lot with my dumb, awful outfit that, that I had  next to me on the passenger seat.  And I'm like, I can't do this.  I will not do this.  And I'm pounding the steering wheel.  My life sucks.  I'm 400 miles away from home trying to make something of myself in radio.  And then it got back to the GM.  I didn't show up.  And rumor had it that he was just going to fire me flat out.  And I actually had to let the tears flow to make sure I didn't get fired. 
[02:58:00]  You used the bitch get out of a ticket strategy.  Hell yeah, man.  Not only did I not get fired, I got a raise.  You got a raise?  Yeah, because I told him how down on my luck I was, making no money, you know, far from  home.  I was collecting change to eat.  But anyway.  I don't like that he's pulling on a heartstring.  I know.  He's trying to get some sympathy now.  He's giving you some background on this dumb thing.  I don't care if you cried in your car and you couldn't eat and you had to go down on 
[02:58:30]  people to get a meal.  You did spuds.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Good morning, baby, man.  Do you want to hear more or what?  Come on.  Not only do I want to hear more, I have to.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm here to make a buck this morning.  Spuds, when aren't you here to make a buck, huh?  Hey.  So do you have your vendor permit?  Uh, yeah. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  I'll trust you, okay?  Okay.  Now, you're going to be vending up and down the parade route today?  I'm going to be selling fudgy wudgy bars this morning.  Oh, Bobby's leaving.  Bobby just got up.  Bobby!  He's physically leaving.  Bobby!  Bobby just left.  That means we can't play anymore, I guess.  He's leaving.  Too bad.  I was willing to give you another 30 seconds today.  And he left.  He left his studio, Ann.  I need to hear more because, like I said, I want new Spuds Buckley. 
[02:59:30]  Everything so far, I've heard already.  I need just something a little new.  Well.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I had to go punch something.  Bobby, why do you think I'm, like, the biggest dick?  Because I've been through the freaking ringer in this business.  Oh, wait a minute.  E-Rock's got a Spuds Buckley song?  What?  We represent the Lolli Buck Show.  The Lolli Buck Show.  The Lolli Buck Show.  Wow.  Sounds just like him. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, you might laugh, but, you know, I was the inspiration for Spongebob Squarepants.  That is true.  Yes, Drew.  I could have been making Spongebob Squarepants money.  You got to play some more.  I need new Spuds Buckley for the next break.  Oh, yeah.  See?  Just in case you thought I was lying, listen to this.  Uh-oh.  Many years later, this is what was going on in pop culture.  I was on to something, my friends.  Yeah, you were on.  La, la, la, la. 
[03:00:30]  La, la, la, la, la.  See?  That's from Spongebob Squarepants.  Yeah.  I was on to something.  Yeah, you were.  About 10 years later, all of a sudden, they're ripping off Spuds Buckley.  Where's my residuals?  I need residuals.  Why do you think I'm a dick, dude?  I've done it all in this business.  Ant knows.  I freaking had to sit on the side of the Long Island Expressway at a gas station pumping  a dollar two gas and handing roses to fatties for Valentine's Day. 
[03:01:00]  I've done it all.  I've had it.  I've done the Jell-O wrestling in parking lots and stupid kiddie pools.  This is such a back story of how Opie became Opie.  Absolutely.  And I was the guy, oh, he don't mind.  Let him work every holiday.  Oh, God, that's why I'm a dick, if you really want to get into it.  I've seen it all, my friend.  Get into it.  I had to do two for Tuesdays, and I had to get the lead out.  And I did Mandatory Metallica, and I did the foreplay weekend where the fourth cut is always live. 
[03:01:30]  That was me.  Of course it is.  Who do you think was spinning the tunes for your block party weekend?  Me!  Who ran the 5 o'clock funnies?  Me!  5 o'clock, I've done those.  Freeway jam?  Yeah, the 5 o'clock traffic jam.  Traffic jam, yeah.  Well, you get some jamming tunes.  That was me, Bob!  He's having a nervous breakdown.  That's why I'm a dick. 
[03:02:00]  Let's go to Jason in Carolina.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, 4-Opie, he's gone through all this radio hell, and what was he doing a week ago?  Rubbing baby crap under his nose.  Nothing's changed for you, man.  Nah, that's true.  You're right.  I'm still Spongebuckly deep down.  I'll always be him.  It's okay, Hopi.  Relax.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It was just the beginning.  It was the way you got into, you know, the business. 
[03:02:30]  Who do you think played the songs when we did the 9 to 5 promotion?  Listen to a song in the 9 o'clock hour.  Listen to one in the 2 o'clock hour.  Listen to the one in the 5 o'clock hour.  Be the 10th caller.  And you win this crappy prize.  That was me!  I'm scared.  Very.  Done every dumb promotion available.  Very frightening.  Very frightening.  We still love you, though.  He's nervous.  Who started Led Zeppelin A to Z? 
[03:03:00]  I started with the first song.  The Firecracker 500.  That was me!  Firecracker 500.  That's 4th of July or weekend, right?  Yeah!  Who do you think had a sleep at the radio station the 4th of July weekend?  Me!  While you're out there barbecuing and drinking and picking up broads!  I had to make believe this Firecracker 500 thing was important.  Oh, guess what the number one song of all time is going to be? 
[03:03:30]  Oh, is it going to be Stairway to Heaven?  Oh, maybe it'll be Freebird this time around.  That was me!  I had to make believe it mattered!  What?  Oh, he's throwing things.  He's all angry.  He's not even throwing things that won't hurt.  He threw a coffee mug.  Oh, Jesus.  Big, heavy Starbucks one.  It's a big, heavy Starbucks.  Who threw that?  Who had to deliver the big six-foot heroes and the pizza to the office parks? 
[03:04:00]  I actually did that.  I remember that.  I did that at BAB where I thought I was actually, you know, finally doing something with my career.  And, like, one of my jobs was I had to, like, get the six-foot hero and go to an office park in the middle of nowhere.  And all of a sudden I'm in this office and no one gives a crap.  They just want the free sub.  No one knew who I was.  And I'm handing out T-shirts and ice scrapers.  And I see a kid I graduate with.  And he's like, why are you bringing me lunch?  And I'm like, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's me. 
[03:04:30]  Remember when I had this dream of going into broadcasting when we were in history class together?  Well, this is what it's become ten years later.  Well, like the guy said, though, I mean, you did make it.  You're on a great hit show.  Well, not back then.  Well, right now, though, you did.  You made it.  It's just embarrassing back then.  Yeah.  Actually, you know it wasn't.  It was actually cool.  Honey, guess what I did today?  I went down to this big office park.  I brought ice scrapers.  And everybody was glad to see me because it was icy out. 
[03:05:00]  Because it was icy out.  Brought a sandwich.  And it was great because everyone was kind of hungry.  Dude, there was a crowd.  And I just threw T-shirts into them.  It was nuts.  They were going nuts.  And I'd wait.  And then I'd throw it.  And they'd go.  They love me.  Oh, they love me, man.  The guy gave me his card.  He gave me his card.  He told me to give him a call.  He might want me to promote something as Spuds Buckley.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Let me say hi to Lydia from Oceanside.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Lydia. 
[03:05:30]  You know, last time I spoke to you, you said you would never, ever see a therapist.  But I hear so much anguish in your voice about your past.  I wonder if you wouldn't reconsider.  So you think I need a therapist?  I'm just suggesting that you may have a therapist.  Well, I think you need a big black dick up your ass.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  What's going on?  I certainly hope someone's being attentive.  I certainly hope someone's being attentive down the hall. 
[03:06:00]  Opie certainly gave her a fine, how do you do?  Wow.  Jeez.  Where are we?  Yeah.  Anthony, where are we?  Frequency modulation, Opie.  We are on frequency modulation.  You must wait until this signal is beamed into outer space.  Yeah.  And returns back to Earth, cleansed in the atmosphere.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, put it together for...  La, la, la, la, la, la, la. 
[03:06:30]  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:07:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  No, it's funny.  People have no idea that we're actually really good friends.  Because we just don't play that way on the air.  That's all right.  My chick goes, you actually shared a room with him when you played Doral?  I'm like, yeah, we were both lonely, man.  It was three nights we stayed in a hotel and a resort.  Was it three nights?  Yeah, it was like, yeah, definitely.  In the same room?  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  What is wrong with you guys?  I wanted a roommate.  Are you kidding me?  I didn't want sex or any of that crap.  I just wanted a roommate.  I was lonely.  I was just wandering around.  Lonely?  I was wandering around the country.  Rich Voss calls me up.  He's like, hey, I got this great deal.  We could go down to Doral and play where Tiger Woods plays and the PGA plays.  And South Beach is, what, a mere half hour, 40 minutes away?  Not even.  It was 20 minutes.  Over the bridge.  Over the bridge.  It was like 20 minutes.  And we both decide, what the hell? 
[03:08:00]  We'll just share a room.  What am I going to do?  Go back to like a room by myself and just sit there and stare at the wall?  Well, see, here's the thing.  I would never.  Yeah?  I didn't know.  Like, one night we're laying in bed, not together.  After that crack story, I doubt it.  Nice pair of hot pants on.  You're sponing with them?  All right.  I had a wetsuit.  And we're laying in separate beds.  And it starts off with, like, one depressing story about your childhood.  And it goes from my story to his stories. 
[03:08:30]  And his are starting to really bum me out.  It's hard to do.  You grew up.  I thought I had some depressing bad stories.  Wait, which story bummed you out?  Do you remember?  I don't remember.  But, you know, I don't know.  Maybe your mother up in the attic or something?  Did you see it?  Oh, yeah.  We used to find her in the attic every once in a while.  Yeah.  She needed a timeout.  What's her last name?  Frank?  Yeah.  My mom needed timeouts.  We would have to go search for her.  And we found her in the attic a couple times.  That's actually a true story.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Why was she up there?  She's, you know, got issues there. 
[03:09:00]  Dusting?  Haven't you been around long enough?  You don't need to ask why.  Just look at me.  What do you think?  No, I haven't, actually.  Look at the one side of me, and then you can figure it all out.  But that was the one that depressed you?  I don't know.  It just was, you know.  But then it was like, you know, then we were playing top this, basically.  And then Rich is telling his horrible stories.  And we're sitting there.  We're almost like, we're almost ready to start cuddling and find each other's shoulder.  Almost.  Then it was time to sleep.  And then this idiot has to wake up in the middle of the night to smoke cigarettes. 
[03:09:30]  Jesus.  Still on that health kick, Rich?  That was, that was.  Well, he stopped smoking finally.  But he was so addicted to the nicotine that he would wake up in the middle of the night to have smokes.  And he's half asleep, just drooling, having a cigarette.  The cigarette is like falling out of his mouth as he's falling back asleep.  He's going to burn you up.  Right.  Then we play golf.  And you've heard the stories.  Jackass breaks his hand in the sand trap.  So now I have a crippled depressed guy in my room that I can play golf with. 
[03:10:00]  Okay.  All right.  Oh, so that's what led you to making out with the grandma?  What?  I almost said he's hot chicks.  We met these girls now.  Hot chicks?  I almost said the mom, the grandma.  The grandma was Johnny Winter's mother, basically.  She was an albino.  This woman was an albino hippie with the weird blue eyes.  Yeah.  Not the cool blue eyes.  Like almost like the.  Albino eyes.  Like, yeah.  They're like faded, faded jean eyes.  Yeah.  Okay.  So we're both single at the time. 
[03:10:30]  But the daughter was hot.  And he had a nice.  She had some awful Indian name, I remember.  Hiawatha.  Hiawatha.  Hiawatha.  She was like some hippie kid.  You know, the mom name.  Yeah.  Between that or Granola.  You know what I mean?  You know, sunshine.  Yeah.  And so the girl was, the hot one was going towards Opie, you know?  Because maybe, whatever.  She was.  I think he's going to try to rationalize.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  Maybe it was a cast on his hand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a mother-daughter combo.  So to say she was hot, compared to the mother, she was hot, yes. 
[03:11:00]  And Opie had no, I don't think he had a rap, but I tried to take one on the team, you know?  Take one for the team.  Wait, I didn't have a rap because I didn't want her.  Oh.  Well.  Yeah, you were desperate for sex, so you're like, you go walking off at the, where were  we?  The Delano?  Some hotel.  Some really fancy, like, trendy hotel.  We decided to go to the pool area.  It's a pool area where you sit in these cabanas.  Cabanas.  And we're all sitting, having a drink. 
[03:11:30]  Rich doesn't drink, so he's drinking whatever.  And the mom is an alcoholic.  And we're in this cabana just hanging out, having a nice night.  It's a beautiful night in South Beach.  All of a sudden, Rich gives some kind of look to the mom and walks off with her to another  cabana and starts making out with her.  What did you tell her was a teepee?  And that's when Hiawatha, or whatever the hell her name was, said that, you know, that  she's actually a grandma.  She looked like, I knew, she looked like the blonde in Billy Jack that was tied to the 
[03:12:00]  steaks.  What, shit, white hair?  Way back.  What, what, 1971?  Billy Jack movie?  Rich, we're not all 60 here.  Oh, wow.  All right, that's a trial of Billy Jack.  Billy Jack.  Where'd a guy dinner on the beat?  She looked like Richard Widmark and, uh...  And you know what the worst is, though, when you're making out with a 60-year-old lady?  It's not that...  She wasn't...  I bet you in her day she was hot, you know?  Well...  It would have been a good story if I would have closed the deal, right?  That's wonderful.  A lot of chicks would be hot if you could get a time machine.  Yeah, exactly.  But her breasts stunk, too.  Her breasts stunk.  Oh, God. 
[03:12:30]  What a winner.  What the hell is that about?  I don't know.  Maybe because when you're 60 or something, I don't know, your breasts start, like, rotting  away.  Oh, her breasts.  I thought you said her breasts.  No, her breasts.  They probably did, too.  I thought you said breasts.  No, her breasts.  Like an old lady baby powder.  Her breasts stunk.  Well, she's an Indian.  Her liver's probably rotten.  We laughed pretty hard, though.  We had some good times.  Good times.  So, yeah.  Can I tell this quick story about going to the doctor yesterday? 
[03:13:00]  Should I tell it?  Can I tell it with that?  Yeah, since that one went by so fast.  Oh, this is what you wrote down before the break?  Yeah.  I don't know why that came up.  But, yeah, we shared a room.  Yeah.  What's the big deal?  Two guys.  You know what it was?  I didn't realize that I would make a little money.  Two guys, one bed.  What?  I just wouldn't share a room like that.  We did.  And I shared a room once.  We had to.  But we were both really poor at the time, and they flew us out to L.A., and we had to 
[03:13:30]  share a room.  They made us.  That was very awkward.  Sounds like a Barry Katz gig.  I know.  I got to be bumped up to a first class, too, on my gold, then.  You didn't have freaking flying miles or something.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  I got him bumped up.  Oh, wow.  Isn't that something?  You know, I took him under my wings, then.  You know, I said to the guy, you know, he's bouncing around.  Little hummingbird wings, you call his hands.  Bouncing around.  Not under his wing.  Under his wing.  Yeah, wings.  Both of them.  What are you, a pilot for Delta? 
[03:14:00]  When you were spooning, you took him under your wings.  I think Rich Voss secretly wants to date me, because then we went, then last summer,  was it last summer that I decided to go play golf with you, and you showed up with a nice  little lunch for me?  That's a sad story, too.  That's not sad.  I'm not going to kiss him.  We show up to play golf, it's like, you know, at the halfway house, you can get a hot dog  and a beer or whatever the hell you want.  All of a sudden, Rich goes, I packed this lunch, and he pulls out a nice little, little  like cooler.  It had a nice juicy, I think he got me a juice box or something. 
[03:14:30]  Were you just sitting in the middle of the fairway on a checkered blanket with the old  time basket?  What did you make me?  Some bread.  It was like egg salad and, what was it again?  Old time basket.  Yeah.  I'm not, unless I brought, wait, what was the lunch?  Seriously.  It was egg salad.  Did you cut the crust off it for him, honey?  Yes, I cut the, it was egg salad.  I'm not going to bring.  It was an egg salad sandwich, I think it was like an apple, a piece of fruit, and like a  juice box, I take my portion and I go, and I threw it in the garbage in front of him. 
[03:15:00]  I'm not going to make myself lunch and eat in front of somebody.  Really?  Yeah.  Where did you get manners?  No kidding.  Bonnie?  And there's other places to buy stuff to eat at a golf course.  Yeah, that's a...  So you didn't have to, you could have packed your own lunch and been, you know, the cheapo  that you are, and then let Opie...  Oh, I'm not cheap.  I'm far from cheap.  I'll spend some money.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Sure.  I just like a good deal, too, though.  Of course you do.  No, Voss.  What's with the territory?  Voss is all about the good deal, man. 
[03:15:30]  I like a good deal.  He likes a good deal.  Oh, I'm sure when you guys split that room, it was just like, oh, this is great.  Oh, half the price.  I subbed the couch to another person we didn't even know.  I was lonely.  I was lonely.  So, yeah, you packed me a nice little lunch that I...  I'm sorry.  ...that I threw in the garbage, because I honestly, you know, that was creepy.  Yeah.  Sharing a room wasn't creepy to me, but making me a lunch that now you're going over the line. 
[03:16:00]  Now you're getting a little weird.  You two are creeps.  We're all just a bunch of messes.  Who are you kidding, man?  Anthony, it reminds me I have an omelet in the green room.  Right.  Hey, let's go.  Join you for breakfast.  We'll do brunch.  And then the famous story where this ass is more concerned about how well he hit his wedge from 90 yards out that he doesn't bother to yell four as I'm standing there on the green wondering where the shot's going. 
[03:16:30]  He was trying to bargain it down to two.  And to this day, to this day, I got a lump on my hand.  Well, you know what?  Because I'm holding...  You know how...  You play golf, Nick?  No, I don't.  Okay.  I know enough about it, though.  I'm not gay.  A lot of guys, if you're on the green, you got your putter, you kind of almost use it as a cane.  You're leaning on your putter.  Your hand's fully exposed.  And I'm right behind the pin because I'm like, Voss is 90 yards out.  I'm like, he's not going to stick this.  So I'll stand right near the pin. 
[03:17:00]  That's usually a safe bet, right?  So I'm watching Voss hit, and he's not saying anything, and I'm trying to figure out where the ball is.  He's not saying anything, not saying anything.  Next thing I know, I got excruciating pain because the freaking wedge shot hits me perfect right on the top.  Look at the lump.  It's still there.  Two years later, it's still there.  Hold on a minute.  I go down like I got shot.  Like a Kennedy.  I really went down like I got shot.  Immediately start bleeding because it was one of those deep bruises that brought blood right to the surface. 
[03:17:30]  Really?  Yes.  That's the Irish in you.  Yes.  He's the bleeder.  I said, you don't even have to.  I said, don't putt.  Don't worry.  I'll give you the putt.  Okay?  Right before that, he was crying because he had a tick on him.  Okay?  He had a little tick on his butt.  A little tick.  Did you remove that in the room for him?  After the egg salad sandwich?  He did suck out the poison for me, which I appreciate it.  Thank you, Rich.  And where was that tick?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know what?  Calio had another parasite with you called Rich Voss. 
[03:18:00]  I'll tell you why I had a tick.  Because this ass doesn't know how to lose a golf ball.  We all lose golf balls.  Not Rich Voss.  He's a good golfer, Rich.  No, no, no.  He hits.  He's nodding.  You're saying nothing.  He'll spend forever looking for it.  Thank you.  He hits bad shots like anyone.  But what he has to do is find every single ball that he hits into the deep weeds where the ticks freaking live.  Oh, really?  The ticks stop at the woods?  They don't head out to the fairway?  It's sort of like a little tick ray, you know, an electrical tick fence. 
[03:18:30]  Guys, this is it.  We can't head out there.  I hit the ball a little to the left, and I went to look for my ball because I didn't want to take a stroke.  No, you didn't want to buy another one.  No, please.  He starts with a Nike ball.  He starts with a Nike ball.  By the time we're on the green putting, it's like a top flight XL.  The only way you know that is because there was an imprint of top flight on your hand.  That's the only way you would know something like that.  A ball that was lost in, like, 1988, he finds. 
[03:19:00]  He goes, I found my ball, and hits that one.  It doesn't take a stroke.  Anyway.  I can't play golf with him anymore.  Someone's going to get hurt.  Yeah.  Or pregnant.  Let's share a bet at Durrell.  All right, I'll be right back.  Yeah.  That sounds exciting.  I got a couple of drunk squaws at the pool.  I didn't even bring my clubs.  He does.  He does.  We were just hanging out.  What were the news cafe, whatever it was, down there on South Beach. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, I've been there.  And it's a hip little place to be seen.  You're hanging.  You're having some coffee and drinks, whatever.  And he decides to go after the two ugliest people in the joint.  It's South Beach.  It's a good strategy, though.  It's South Beach, though.  The place is, like, just dripping with models.  Desperate models.  And you decide the grandma that looks good.  First of all, they are models.  And so are the guys.  Okay?  We're like threes. 
[03:20:00]  And there's nothing but tens walking by.  That are, you know, from...  Then again, can you imagine?  Well, he's sitting there with his guest shirt, and I have this ugly diesel shirt that looks  like a doily of Paisley.  We're sitting, like, two...  The odd couple.  It's just horrible.  And all these guys are walking by.  They can tell we're from out of...  We're dressing like we think you're supposed to dress in South Beach, so we're so out of  place.  And can you imagine if we did end up picking up those two girls and explain that we're 
[03:20:30]  sharing a room?  Yeah.  See, we're sharing a room.  Could you guys not pay attention to...  I know it's kind of awkward being in here with your mother.  Like we're back in high school.  You're doing a make-out session right next to your bud.  This is kind of weird being in here with the out-of-work DJ and the guy that took third  place this year on Last Comic.  Because we don't have money for our own room.  Not only was she a grandma, she was an albino. 
[03:21:00]  People don't understand.  She had, like, transparent eyes, basically.  A hippie albino.  Yes.  I always liked Edgar Winner, so I figured, what the heck?  I had to bang her.  And you set the sights low, which is kind of good for South Beach.  These girls are so...  Because you know you have no rap in there.  What am I going to do down there?  That's what cocaine is for.  I know.  That's right.  You're right.  It makes you a nine.  It does.  Pulls the drugs out.  You're right.  Donna Trucker is asking if Voss dressed extra sexy, hoping that I would pick up the room tab. 
[03:21:30]  Linger longer.  If you're a person that suffers from depression, don't go to South Beach.  You'll kill yourself.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  I fit right in there.  I'm ripped.  Got a big unit.  There it is.  If you think you're...  He's a man with some pride, finally.  If you think you're somebody, and you walk around South Beach, you realize you're just...  You're just...  You know what it is, though.  Here it is.  Your genetic disaster is what I'm trying to say.  I've got to be honest with you, though. 
[03:22:00]  You've got to use what you got a little bit.  Who?  You.  If you were in that situation, if I'm hanging out with a rich Voss down in South Beach, and  he's picking up grandmas, I am going to be flashing cash, drugs, booze, whatever it  takes to get one of those hot, long-legged girls down there, and not have to get Voss's  friggin' throwaway daughters from the old bag he's making out with. 
[03:22:30]  What you need is a handful of date rape drugs.  There you go.  You know what, though?  In a way...  Hey, look at that.  Doink.  Plop, plop.  You know what?  Plop, plop.  In a way, though, it was...  I don't know.  It was entertaining that it went down that way.  You know what I mean?  He left with a broken hand, and I went and got a tooth pulled, too.  Oh, I forgot.  In between rounds.  What happened?  In between rounds.  Would she give you gingivitis?  In between, like...  Instant pyorrhea.  In between playing Doral. 
[03:23:00]  I forgot about that.  He had to go to a dentist one day.  I'm sitting there in the freaking room waiting for Rich,  because he's getting a tooth removed.  You're on a three-day little jaunt, and he's getting surgery.  Jesus.  You might as well have went with Jack Klugman.  My throat's infected.  Let's play another cigarette.  I forgot about that.  That he's, like, miserable because he can't talk.  He's getting teeth pulled.  His appendix is coming out.  He's getting corrective surgery on his eyes.  He looks healthy, too.  He's got a broken hand. 
[03:23:30]  I got a tooth pulled.  I got to go to Alabama.  I was rejected by a six-year-old lady.  I'm sharing the room.  It wasn't a bad trip.  It sounds like a real blast, guys.  What a mess.  From some bootleg dentist in a strip mall.  I just had dentist on it.  Oh, great.  I need a tooth pulled.  It was so much.  My whole face was swollen.  Of course it was.  It was just bad.  Anyway, I also smell like Coke Logic animation.  This one needs to be animated. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  Jeff in Wyoming.  Jeff?  Yeah, I listen mostly through audible.com.  And I listened to a show from about a year ago last night.  And you guys started to play your first show together.  And you never got around to that again.  Good for you.  Fucking nice call.  Oof.  You know what?  Anthony took my only copy.  You'll never hear it.  You'll never say it.  Well, it was good, the part we heard.  Did you really take it?  Because I can't find it anymore.  It was so complicated. 
[03:24:30]  Did you come in here?  It was completely bad that I took it, I scored the disc, and snapped it into eight pizza  slice-like pieces.  Dropped them all off in different trash bins?  Yeah, yeah.  Did that so it could not be recovered.  You don't think E-Rock has another copy ready to go?  I know he does.  I thought if I said pizza, it would kind of distract him.  Mayonnaise.  Hey, can we hear like a couple of minutes of that?  No.  I like the fact that you sound so young, and Anthony sounds so happy. 
[03:25:00]  We got to play one day.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Exactly.  We got to play one day.  And we got to do it right.  We got to invite the guys in, and we just got to sit back and just take it.  I don't want to.  We have to sit back and take it.  Even if we have to look out the window and not look these guys in the eye.  You get embarrassed when you hear that?  Yeah.  It's embarrassing.  It's the first show we ever did.  Dude, that show got us a job.  I was, well, maybe the subsequent shows got us a job.  No.  That show got me in the door to do more shows with you. 
[03:25:30]  What you don't understand is when we realized that we weren't staying at BAB and we were moving on together, I got most of the bits for the demo that I sent out from that first show.  I was hammered.  And the radio community was just blown away.  He used to do 7 at midnight, and I was in a band.  So, like, I would come in at 7 o'clock at night.  I'd already, like, worked, gone to the ex-wife's bar where she was tending bar, drank, used to drink when I drove everywhere. 
[03:26:00]  I never drove anywhere without a bottle of beer right between my legs, driving, just drinking the whole time, and then at the studio, more drinking, and just hammered.  And I could hear it in myself.  Like, I hear, oh, I'm fucking, I'm just hammered.  I'm all happy to be there.  I'm laughing at everything a little too much.  You know?  It's like, yeah. 
[03:26:30]  That's weird how some people.  I'm catching some slack.  It was 12 years ago.  Some people are able to look at stuff that they did in the beginning and laugh at it.  Like, I have tapes of me when I first started.  I'm doing stand-up.  I will not look at it.  Never, right?  I was dating this girl one time.  She goes, I want to see it.  She kept bugging me.  I go, fine, you want to see it?  Here it is.  And I left.  Everyone else wants to see or hear it.  I went to the store.  I went to the store.  Maybe I went to the other room.  I can't remember.  Remember the second?  First of all, she saw me going over my big, like, red afro. 
[03:27:00]  And she just, like, just immediately put her hands up to her mouth.  Oh, my God.  Like a horror movie.  I think my first joke is a pun.  I can't remember.  It's five.  Did you bring it in?  Of the worst.  Never.  Yes, I brought mine in from 93.  Three years in the business.  We got to explain.  Yes, when we were at NAW, we used to do this bitch.  I think Jimmy starred it where you bring in.  And this is where we're leading to our first show.  But we had all these guys bring in their early material.  And it was brutal.  The best one ever was Voss. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, it's.  Voss is great.  The stuff is so, like, dated also that, like, like that stupid George Burns thing.  It was like George Burns' 100th birthday was coming up or something.  So he was in the news a lot.  And then it was a song that was being played on the radio ad nauseum.  Like, every two seconds, Get the Funk Out was being played.  So I did George Burns singing Get the Funk Out.  How great is that?  We got to replay that.  And it's horrible. 
[03:28:00]  Like, now I hear it and just can't.  I want to bite the microphone and anything around me, my own half.  I want to punch myself.  But that's why we got to set a day aside.  And we have to just do it and let these guys go.  Okay.  How about Friday?  This Friday?  Sunday.  No, no.  2028.  I can't listen to it.  How about you take the day off that day?  It's impossible.  I can sit through it.  I can sit through it.  I know it's going to be brutal, but I can sit through it. 
[03:28:30]  There are days where even this show, like, a replay comes on.  And it'll be on.  And I go, could you?  I'll go to my girlfriend.  I'll go, could you shut me off?  I cannot listen to another word out of my mouth.  I just get sick of me.  I can't listen to that at me this weekend.  I was actually walking to my hotel room.  And it was the weirdest thing.  I dropped off my bags.  I was going back out to meet these people at this bar.  And I'm hearing my voice as I'm, like, having the door open. 
[03:29:00]  And I thought maybe sometimes I accidentally hit the recorder for my set.  And that was on.  And I'm thinking it's not on.  And it was somebody literally watching Comedy Central.  Oh, shit.  And the next hotel room, and I'm hearing my stupid voice, and I'm going, oh.  In the next room?  And I'm literally going, like.  You should have knocked on the door and said, could you turn that shit down?  Oh, I was thinking in my head, stop yelling.  Stop out and be funny.  Do you have to yell every joke?  You're awful.  That's all I was thinking.  I literally, I started humming like an idiot.  I tried to drown it out as I went down to get to the elevator. 
[03:29:30]  You should have knocked on that door and freaked them out, man.  That would have been great.  Just knock on their door.  Oh, that would have been funny.  Can you shut that shit up?  They would tell that story for the rest of their lives.  Oh, yeah.  We were watching, and then the guy.  You should have knocked on the door and go, could you turn down your fucking TV and see  if he even figures it out?  Then you realize it's the wrong room, and you get your fucking throat cut.  He's watching porno.  I also wanted to leave before I heard somebody moaning, like, this guy sucks.  Oh, yeah, see?  That's another thing.  All he's doing is yelling.  I can't, I'm like that. 
[03:30:00]  I can't listen to it subjectively.  I can't just, I hear every little inflection, every line, every little pause, everything.  I hear.  You also, you also do it.  Why?  You gotta do this.  Just for a minute.  It's putting his coat on.  Best Rock WBAB, Soul Asylum, Black Gold, Steve Miller, and the latest from R.E.M., What's  the Frequency?  Kenneth, as you do the nighttime attitude, it's opium board. 
[03:30:30]  Thanks for checking out the program tonight.  And we got another fine show planned for you guys tonight.  We got my pals.  I was way too nice.  My delivery is way too, hey, I'm your friend.  I don't want to.  I'm being edgy, but I'm also your friend.  Look, Anthony, it's coming.  A lot of people agree like that, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  We always.  Shut up.  We always get.  You gotta get off.  We always get to this point, and then we really can't go much further.  I can't. 
[03:31:00]  I can't.  You can't go much further.  Between on board, and I'm fucking.  Like, Opie's running a pirate ship.  Thanks for coming on board.  And I'm fucking.  Ah.  Yeah.  I'm just like.  Yeah.  He's like Paula Abdul.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on, Abba.  I'm all.  I'm too fucking happy to be there.  This time around, we're only 28 seconds in.  Let's try to get to a minute.  No.  Not a minute.  No.  At least try.  No.  Just tell me when you have to punch out.  I'm punching out. 
[03:31:30]  No.  Tap.  No, no, no.  You gotta stop when you tap.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's at least try to get to a complete minute.  He took his headphones off.  His headphones are off.  I can't listen.  He's covering himself with a coat.  Listen, can I make some phone calls and conduct business during this segment?  Joe and Anthony from Rotgut, live in the studio.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Just in case people don't know who you are yet.  Yeah.  Well, oh, that happens all the time.  They are the famous authors of Gun Electric Shock OJ, which you're going to do live on the 
[03:32:00]  show tonight.  That's right.  And you're going to do other ditties.  Yeah, other wacky, kooky stuff, baby.  What's wrong with that?  That's a funny way to answer.  Shut the fuck up.  Anthony, that's hard.  Shut it off.  I can't take it.  He sounds like somebody doing a bad impression of George Carlin doing the wacky radio guy.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Anthony, that was good.  By the way, this is no fucking bit.  He really is uncomfortable in his skin right now.  Oh, I can't take this.  I know exactly what happened.  No, I can't do it. 
[03:32:30]  I know what he's going through.  I'm not the kind of guy that can do this.  I can't do roasts.  I can't be roast.  I can't.  I can't.  I'm getting major douche chills, but I'm dealing.  I know it's worse than douche chills, but with something deep-seated, I can't deal with it.  And you know what it is?  I'll freak out.  You're bringing on the humiliation now, because I'm not even thinking about making fun of  Opie, because you're underneath your coat right now.  But I can't.  You see?  Because there's a lot to make fun of me about.  Wait.  No.  All you've got to do is just admit, yeah.  I said ditties.  I said soul asylum, of course. 
[03:33:00]  I'm your friendly neighborhood DJ.  Now Jim's going to pull his phony it's okay shit.  Here it comes.  Don't be such geese.  Opie made a good point.  He goes, we've got a rod get here tonight.  And Anthony went, that's right, Opie.  It's important to agree.  Listen, let's try.  You know what?  You're right.  You start to hear the chemistry between the two of them.  He was great.  That's where the chemistry began, right there, right there.  Did you play that again?  Because I don't think I heard that.  I don't think I heard it. 
[03:33:30]  I can't go backwards.  I usually go backwards with these things.  I can't.  Look, he's covered himself in it.  But that's where the chemistry began.  This is the first time we're on mic together, live in his studio.  Let's try, Anthony.  Oh, if there are aliens, please beam me up to a ship.  I don't want to be on this planet right now.  Dude, honestly.  Shut up.  How will he know you agree with him if you don't tell him?  That's right, Opie.  You were correct.  All right, let's try to get to two minutes.  No!  Let's attempt to get to two minutes. 
[03:34:00]  I will say this.  I had a Friday night video with my first TV spot recently, and I was trying to play it  for my girlfriend.  Yeah.  I got through 30 seconds of it because I was a high-energy guy, and I was coming out like  the nervous, quirky guy, and I rubbed my head, and I went, how you doing?  And I feel sexy.  And it was like this joke about how I'm not sexy, and I had to stop it.  Is the audio good?  It's from television.  It's really clear.  Can you bring it in?  Is it good?  No.  Is it clear as a bell? 
[03:34:30]  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Can you bring it in?  Yeah, of course I will.  Yes.  This text from my sister Dawn, simple, ew.  My fucking sister just texted me, E-W-W-W.  All right, let's try to get to two minutes today.  The last time we did this, I think we got about a minute in.  That was a misspell.  She was trying to write aww, and me with a bunch of W's because it's cute.  We're at 50 seconds in.  She smells this stink.  We're at 50 seconds in, and this first bit is 16 minutes, by the way. 
[03:35:00]  Can I, can I, 16 minutes.  Can't the defense have a few words?  I hadn't done radio.  I was in a band.  You could never tell, though.  You were so mad.  Shut up.  This is me after a few beers trying to make some type of impression on the great Opie.  Oh, Jesus.  Who at that point was a radio, you know, you had a radio career going for yourself, and 
[03:35:30]  I would have loved to have gotten into radio.  I hate to say this, but at this point, counting college radio, I had been doing it in a decade,  so I have no excuses.  I wanted to do radio.  I was so nervous and so, like, wanting to have Opie go, oh, my God, this is great, because  I knew this was my only foot in the fucking door.  I got lightning in a bottle.  So I was so overdoing things. 
[03:36:00]  Look, you know what, though?  That's exactly what happened that day.  I thought it was great, and, you know, it's dated now, of course, but as far as, like,  two guys doing a show, there was, like, major potential there, and we've been writing it  ever since.  I'm not going to be able to make it past George Burns doing Get the Funk Out.  We're 49 seconds in.  Bill just winced.  Bill just visibly winced at me.  Because I know what you're going through.  That's the funny thing about this fucking business is by the time everybody sees you, you know 
[03:36:30]  what you're doing, but there's no class on how to learn how to do radio.  No.  They'll teach them, and they'll take your money, but people send you emails all the time.  Hey, I'm starting out doing stand-up.  You got any tips?  And it's just like the old-school dad teaching you how to swim.  They just throw you in the deep end.  You're like, ah!  Sink or swim, you little fuck.  This is what I say.  You're suffering, Anthony, but I think we're going to do this until you definitely can't  take any more.  I know this. 
[03:37:00]  I'm there, man.  No, you're almost there.  This is so hard.  All right, back to the tape.  49 seconds in.  Don't look at me, Billy.  Just rip the Band-Aid off.  Just rip it off, man.  Here we go.  Let's sit here.  I'm trying.  Deal with it today.  Let's try again.  I'm trying to man up over here.  Let's move a little further in.  We're a little bitter.  We gave Eddie Vedder the idea to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what someone just said.  You know, they heard Pearl Jam's version of sitting on the Dock of the Bay, and they  were expecting to hear the O.J. version.  He sounded like he was heavily sedated.  All right, I need a ruling. 
[03:37:30]  I started a new bit yesterday.  All right, I'm out.  No, no, no, no, no.  Come on.  No, I'm out.  We'll give you a ruling?  Isn't this fucking hard?  I'll be honest now.  I'm out.  Come on, Opie.  Opie.  I want to hear some of your old stuff.  I want to hear some of your old stuff.  Jim.  Jim.  Jim.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Time out.  Time out.  Time out.  It was fun, but it's not fun.  Time out.  There's five people in here.  Oh, wow, Bill.  I wonder what they're going to vote. 
[03:38:00]  We're going to take a vote.  Come on.  It's America.  Stan.  Sit your foot.  Oh, please.  You know how she's going to vote.  Fuck you.  Oh, boy.  I'm so out.  I need to.  Come on.  Oh, boy.  And we took a couple.  Opie, just take one.  This is so horrible.  Oh, what is that, Iraq?  Well, you guys do an Electric Shock OJ live.  Oh, Jesus.  What was the bit?  Because I would be willing to give a ruling.  I think it's fair.  This is radio history.  You can't deny the listeners.  Oh, and there it should remain like fucking Pompeii buried in volcanic ash. 
[03:38:30]  Come on.  It's horrible.  Opie, come on.  It's too dated.  Oh, my God.  It's I'm too happy to be there.  Opie's doing his radio show like.  Look, I never deny that I did some hacky stuff.  All right.  Opie's not even looking at anybody.  Look at him.  Opie's staring at his fucking cereal like the Rain Man.  I had to listen to a boss back in the day because I had no choice.  This is so difficult.  Blaming the audience.  Let it be known we haven't listened to a boss in over 10 years. 
[03:39:00]  I can't.  I can't deal.  Oh, holy shit.  I started a new bit yesterday.  Celebrity death watch.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  You might have been.  You might have heard this.  Oh, yeah.  Monday, Jessica Tandy, the old broad from Driving Miss Daisy died.  Stop smiling, Dan.  I'll take that contract.  How old is she?  It's 85.  Oh, please.  Anyways, I don't know about you, but I've always been under the.  It's not that bad, actually.  Celebrities die in threes, basically. 
[03:39:30]  Always.  Always, right?  So, it's the celebrity death watch.  I guarantee two more prominent celebrities will die before October 1st.  I can't.  Dude, maybe it's a hacky band.  That's not awful, though.  It's like you were just a local guy.  That's honestly not that bad, a celebrity death watch.  I know.  I was actually enjoying it.  I'm wondering who the celebrity.  Shut up, you lying cunt.  No, you're not.  Dude, honestly.  I'm telling you, honestly.  Like, the part that I think is really, like, the type that I would feel like a dick about  is, and you went, okay, like that. 
[03:40:00]  All right, yeah.  But a celebrity death watch.  Stop it.  Don't rub it in.  Not that bad.  It's extremely painful.  Some of it will be, but that.  Will be.  I honestly didn't think that part was that bad.  I'm not even being a dick.  No, I'm telling you.  You know me well if you don't mean sarcastic.  I'm really not.  Believe me, I'm sure plenty of this is horrid.  I still have a little.  I can't listen to one thing I say.  I'm barely hanging in there, I'll be honest.  I'm on the ledge.  I got my fingernails.  I can hear just a little more.  A little bit.  I fell already. 
[03:40:30]  A little bit.  I can't listen to one word out of my fucking mouth.  Not one word.  You hear that chicken cliffhanger at the beginning.  Oh.  You just let go.  Yeah, I just let go.  I can't listen to one word without cringing.  I'm too happy to be there.  Before October 1st.  So we're just waiting and watching.  George Burns in the hospital the other day.  It was a close call.  Very close call.  But he got out of it.  98 years old.  He has like, his brain is swelling.  And he pulled out.  And he pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see.  Come out.  No, no, why?  That dude. 
[03:41:00]  No, he was just.  Thank God the FCC wasn't listening.  Oh, no.  Such a harsh reaction.  Oh, no.  I was like, darn.  Darn.  Darn.  Darn.  Darn.  Darn.  No.  Jimmy.  I'm just saying that Jimmy is picking up on all this.  Fucker.  Dude.  I'm just saying Jimmy's picking up on this.  Fine.  Fine.  And he's being the fuck about it.  Fine.  I'll.  We got to play this on the other side.  No.  Darn.  Darn.  This is horrible.  Darn should be a sound effect.  Fine.  I'll rewind.  Darn.  But now I continue to take.  No. 
[03:41:30]  Because I'm going to stop right there.  No, I'm with you.  You weren't with me.  You jumped off.  I'm with you.  Opie.  Live long and prosper.  I'm with you.  He wasn't with you, Opie.  Shut up.  Totally wasn't.  What a dick.  I played the whole tape.  This is eight years old.  He has like his brain is swelling.  He pulled out.  And he pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see George.  Okay.  How'd you guys land a job?  Like, weren't they afraid you'd get thrown off the air for language?  Hey.  Did you throw your fist to the side?  Like, darn.  Gee willikers. 
[03:42:00]  Boy.  You really were, Opie.  Came a long way from, yeah, I said fuck on the air, and I'll say it again.  Yeah, there you go.  That's when I was tough.  Oh.  From darn.  That's a great twist, by the way.  Speaking of faggots, we have calling in today.  Oh, yeah.  This is quite a progression.  Exactly.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I'm sweating.  Wow.  This just is beyond.  I know.  I'm all fucking sweaty hot now.  I'll listen to this.  It's not even that bad, guys. 
[03:42:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's not.  It's horrid.  It's just because you're in on the tape.  You feel it better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's not.  Exactly is what I'm trying to say.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  It's not that bad.  Oh, I want to reach back in time.  Of all the things I could do with a time machine, kill Hitler.  I would go back to this ass on the radio and slap him silly and say, knock it off.  Stop being so happy to fucking be here. 
[03:43:00]  Here's the deal.  We've attempted this bit, I don't know, four or five times.  We've never gotten past George Burns singing Get the Funk Out.  I can't.  Let's try to at least get past that part of the tape.  That was so bad.  That was a good thing.  He pulled out.  And he pulled out of it.  I was like, darn.  I always wanted to see George Burns singing that extreme song.  If you don't like what you see here, get the funk out.  But he never does that. 
[03:43:30]  Very good.  Maybe now after he's bopped on the head.  But I need a ruling.  I got an obituary.  Patrick O'Neill, 66.  People are going, Patrick who?  Now, I said it has to be a prominent celebrity.  This guy was in Stepford Wives, 1975.  What do you think?  It's on the fence.  Is he prominent?  Let me see, Joe.  What do you think?  I rule me.  I rule me.  All right.  So it's still one with two celebrities to go two weeks from now.  Two to go.  Two to go.  All right.  Well, we're going to debut real-  That was a great bit. 
[03:44:00]  I can't.  It was a great bit.  You got past the George Burns thing, and it's actually just you guys-  You're just talking.  No.  You guys got past it.  Yeah, I didn't get past it.  I'm still dealing with it right now.  I'm not past it.  Why did I care if George Burns sang extreme?  The key is you understood that a lot of people were curious.  No, why?  No one wanted to hear that.  No, it made sense, because he's George Burns. 
[03:44:30]  Should I recreate the one?  I couldn't possibly.  Come on.  You fucking ass.  Couldn't get the song wrong this time, shithead.  Why wouldn't George Burns sing this?  Now that I think about it.  I thought it was really embarrassing, because I actually bought this tape and thought it  was a good song, but it was out.  Did you? 
[03:45:00]  When did you buy it and where?  I don't know.  You're always going through your life when that happened.  Stop changing the subject.  I still want to try to fight our way out of this.  We'll fight our way out of this.  You got through a bad part, and you know something else is going to happen, and we can move on.  We should take a break, really.  You've been a decent part now.  I have incredible stamina today.  I don't know about you.  I feel great.  This is the first one.  What about XM?  You don't have to take breaks.  Beautiful.  That's too much.  It's like 45 minutes.  I got to pee.  This is the furthest we've ever gotten with the tape.  Unless there's something horrible coming up.  Travis has a faggy picture holding a cat. 
[03:45:30]  What?  I don't know.  I'm throwing out anything I can.  Shit.  Get the pic out.  Got emailed.  All right.  You ass.  Well, we're going to debut real fast a song from Rodgut about the Cuban refugees.  Right?  There was a...  What is wrong with this?  I say there's a very top goal because Fidel Castro, there's a jet watch.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's wrong with this song?  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can I shut the fuck up for a minute?  Can I just let you talk without...  Yeah.  Blah.  No.  Oh.  There's a mic in front of me.  I couldn't shut up for two fucking seconds.  I had to agree with everything.  But Anthony, weren't you like excited to like beginning of fulfilling a dream?  Yeah.  Obviously.  That's the point that's so embarrassing is that I was put in this position where I could  have been like cool and collected and done radio with an established radio show. 
[03:46:30]  You know what?  But I was like a fucking giddy fucking little girl in there laughing and yucking it up.  See...  Oh, I'm disgusted with that audio.  Most radio guys...  I kind of liked it.  Here's the problem, man.  Shut up.  Here's the problem.  Most guys...  See those tapes.  Most guys didn't save their radio shows.  I just happened to save everything.  Why did you save this? 
[03:47:00]  Because I knew.  I just knew.  This should have been flung out the window.  He knew you guys were going to be great.  And, you know, a lot of those old Tonight shows don't even exist anymore.  So the fact that they have this...  They taped on them, right?  Yeah.  Well, these actually are on kinescope.  You want...  I got my college radio tapes.  I'll bring those in.  No problem.  Now that I could listen to.  Yeah, but you have to bring something in.  You have to bring something in.  Jimmy, you have to bring something in.  I have...  One of 30 I'll bring in.  Very embarrassing...  Dan and Sam will just play your show you did two weeks ago. 
[03:47:30]  I have very embarrassing, sappy, 80s-type songs that me and my brother wrote.  All right.  That's good enough.  That are really bad.  Really incredibly bad.  Why don't we have one of those...  Douche chill shows.  Yeah, we'll go rewind or whatever you want to call it.  And we'll rewind.  Oof.  All right.  Let's see if we can get a little further in the tick here.  Oof is right.  I'll take another ending on that one.  All right.  Listen to the song that these guys came up with.  And with Fidel Castro dying any day, it's very topical today. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, is it?  12 years later.  What about the Cuban refugees?  Right.  There was a...  Billy Joel made a tribute to the Bayman.  Right.  And we figured, you know, why not go to the other southern half of the states and make  a little tribute to the Cuban boat people?  Let's check it out on the Nighttime Attitude.  I think it just goes in and out.  Wow.  With the whole song.  I could sail on a broken viñata.  Of course, the obligatory parody.  And I hope I can roll very fast. 
[03:48:30]  I've been out for about 15 minutes.  Didn't see that coming.  I'm leaving Cuba like my brother did before.  Him and his family sailing on the bathroom door.  My poor dead cousin was too dumb to build a boat. 
[03:49:00]  He learned the hard way that a Buick doesn't float.  Now I sail on a cheese enchilada.  Why?  And the water is up to my neck.  But the one thought that keeps us on the wing  is of cashing our first welfare check.  It's not bad, dude. 
[03:49:30]  We're leaving Castro not because he's to be feared.  We're just embarrassed by El Presidente's beer.  That hairy maddeness, you know he must have lice.  My mother's beard's long, but at least she keeps it nice.  Now I sail on a land.  It's not bad at all, man.  It's dated.  What are you going to do?  It's not much, but it's all that I've got. 
[03:50:00]  How I wish I was Ricky Ricardo.  Cause his drum would seem just like a yacht.  Ba-ba-loo, ah-yay.  Ba-ba-loo, ah-yay.  Ba-ba-loo, ah-yay. 
[03:50:30]  Ba-ba-loo, ah-yay.  Oh, you gotta love that.  All right.  Don't open the paper and start reading it during one of my parodies, motherfucker.  I just dump water on Pilsen's newspaper.  That, um, the only, maybe if you did that now, there might be one or two lines you would  make a little better, but that was good, man.  I mean, I'd love to trash you, but.  Thank you.  Fucking, there was, uh, what was one line?  It was really, oh, on the bathroom door. 
[03:51:00]  It was good.  Oh, yeah.  That Buick doesn't float.  Back in the old, uh, song parody writing days.  Let's say hi to a rude dog.  We've never gotten this far in the tape.  We're five minutes in.  Uh, rude dog, what's up?  The nighttime attitude?  Ugh.  I can have fun.  Hold it.  Cocksuckers.  Yeah, well.  It's not helping the heat issue.  Well, the nighttime attitude turned into the O&A virus.  See, it had to start somewhere.  Rob in Iowa, what's up?  Thank you.  It had to start somewhere for the love of fuck. 
[03:51:30]  They didn't just start building fucking skyscrapers, you asses.  You don't stop with the, you start with the top floor.  Exactly.  That's what everybody's saying.  So, you know, keep playing the tape.  The basement's usually a very ugly place.  Right.  You gotta start somewhere.  Foundations, dirt, and cement.  Look at the.  You'll get pretty windows in chrome.  Dirt, cement, and song parodies.  Look at the first computer.  Look at, uh, look at, uh, the old Discman.  It's now the tiny little shuffle that iPod has.  So you gotta start somewhere. 
[03:52:00]  Thank you.  Uh, the creativity was there, though.  Right?  I've.  Uh, Rob in Iowa, what's up?  See it.  Yeah, I just wonder where I can order some rock gut music.  Actually, Joe's still, uh, peddling rock gut stuff, right?  Of course.  I don't know where.  Ant doesn't even know where.  Joe's in Vegas.  Uh, I think at the Mirage for a month.  All month long.  Doing you two?  Yeah.  Are they staying at the Mirage?  I think so.  Jesus.  I know.  Apparently, if you can't get you two, you get my brother. 
[03:52:30]  That's.  Can we book you two?  No, they're busy.  Get me, Joe.  And the amazing thing is, he has a, a new Bono every week.  And he still pulls it off somehow.  That's it.  All right.  Uh, so far, not bad.  So why don't we continue?  There's one thing.  I will be completely honest.  As soon as it happens, because I know it will happen, I am completely out and you're going  to have to fight me to push play again.  I know what you mean.  I'm not even kidding.  I know what you mean.  You will have to physically fight me, sit on me, and then hit play again. 
[03:53:00]  Ah, God.  Because that will be it for me.  That will be it for me.  It really hasn't been that bad.  So far, not, I'm all right.  No, I'm not.  But there's one thing he knows.  I think Jimmy knows.  I actually don't know.  No, you do know, Joe.  This is the kind of radio I would have listened to back then.  Shut up.  I'm telling you, there's one thing, and it's coming.  And when it does, I'm done.  I know when you're punching out.  Done.  Done.  This is no explanation.  I have explained it, but.  My phone is going off like crazy.  I didn't know the text. 
[03:53:30]  Hold on.  Let's see.  Oh, it's Dawn again.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Ugh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Imperial.  Remember that.  Maybe a song or something.  Don't be so cryptic, Dawn, you dummy.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's.  I'm lashing out.  I love that.  Rock God on the Nighttime Attitude.  And on the eighth day.  St. John's.  Founded by the Vincentian community in 1870. 
[03:54:00]  Long Island's best rock.  WBAB.  Hold his eyes, though.  Squeeze.  Oh, we're live.  102.3 WBAB.  Oh.  Long Island.  It's Opie and the Nighttime Attitude.  All right.  Oof.  All right.  I got through that.  That's bad.  I get it, but I'm all right.  Well, it sounded like you were going to say live in Long Island, and you just, you were like,  and then I fucked, yeah, well, duh, my stammering started way back then. 
[03:54:30]  Who are you kidding?  It's fine.  Holy crap.  I just don't take my blood pressure.  Oh.  Long Island.  It's Opie and the Nighttime Attitude.  Squeeze, of course, and Tempted.  Sending that out to Sally in Levittown, faithful listener of the program.  Oh, you used to have to do.  My choice, Opie.  I'm out of my mind tonight, because I got Joe and Anthony from Rotgut, and these guys  are, you guys are, you guys are mental.  That's right.  But thanks for stopping on by.  I appreciate it.  No problem.  Anytime.  We're glad to do it.  Why am I talking like that? 
[03:55:00]  Because he's crazy.  Why am I doing that?  You're nutty.  Why am I, just fucking talk, you dumb fuck.  Why?  But it was funnier to go, Annie.  Can you play that again?  Like, his delivery was impressive.  Jimmy, we're going to get your first appearance on this show.  Dude, I came in, there's nothing you'll do.  If you blew each other on air, it wouldn't be as embarrassing as my 1993 tape that I played,  How We Did It?, where I was the high energy, please love me guy.  Oh, I hear it.  That went to the core of who I was. 
[03:55:30]  This is just newness and nervousness.  That's funny.  That was your most honest stuff, was when you first went on stage.  Jimmy, will you bring it in tomorrow?  I'll bring in a better one, which is the Friday Night Videos one, because the audio is clear.  Yeah, let's get you clear.  Yeah, of course.  I have it on DVD.  All right.  All right.  If you agree to that.  Oh, Joe's at the Imperial.  Oh, that's what it was.  The Imperial.  No problem.  Any time.  We're glad to do it.  Pizza Deluso, Comac.  Oh, gee.  That would be Cliff.  Yeah, no, that would be Cliff, Joe, and Greg.  All we have to do is say it 10 times and we get it.  Joe is the king of the plug from day one. 
[03:56:00]  Day one, Joe would just plug everything.  So apparently, if he said Pizza Deluso 10 times, they were going to bring a pizza.  Bye.  So, yeah.  And I was always kind of a little embarrassed by that whole aspect.  I thought perhaps, you know, as I'm trying to latch on to a radio career here, doing my great, great material, that maybe just plugging to get a free pizza.  But that wasn't the time nor place.  Let's say hi to Madonna, Mike.  Mike, what's up? 
[03:56:30]  Hey, who's playing at Sundance this weekend, boys?  You know.  I don't know what happened to the phone there.  I got something.  I got to say, though, I mean, 10 plugs for a free pie.  I mean, that Joe, what a negotiator.  Yeah, really.  Christ.  Really?  What's up?  Eight minutes of airtime.  This was a pie in 94.  Jesus.  $6.95?  Right.  He plugged for a $7 food item.  The movie was $4. 
[03:57:00]  Jesus.  60 cents off the bill for each plug.  Say it 10 times and we get a free pizza.  Are you serious?  They deliver it.  They're going to deliver it right here.  All right.  Do it real fast.  Is that right, guys?  That would be pizza de Lusso.  Pizza de Lusso.  Pizza de Lusso.  Pizza de Lusso.  Pizza de Lusso.  Pizza de Lusso.  Pizza de Lusso.  That's five, six.  Pizza de Lusso.  I said it, too.  Pizza de Lusso.  Oh, so that's 10.  We're up to 12.  That's a pie and a half.  All right.  All right.  So, Joe, Cliff, Cliff, get in your van and start down here.  I want one with everything on it.  That's great.  My boss is going to love that one.  That was about $1,000 worth of advertising.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it. 
[03:57:30]  All right.  Hey, we have Sam Kinison in the studio tonight, too.  Oh, no.  Dude, I'm a Kinison fan.  You didn't tell me he showed up.  All right.  You guys were getting a guest back then?  All right.  Hold on.  I have to leave.  No.  I really.  Dude, a celebrity came in.  This is the second time in a week that Anthony co-host is walking off of a program on 202.  Well, you know what?  I got to admit to him, Anthony, I'm not being a dick, but this is actually on a lot of levels  really cool to listen to.  Yeah?  Listen to you start out. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, sure.  You got to keep me in the room.  Try your best.  You can bring in a live and dish coop to fucking sit on my face, and I would still get up and  leave.  Anthony.  I can't listen to me.  I love Sam Kinison.  There's got to be a rule where you can't leave.  That's why I'm leaving.  Opie, there's got to be a rule where you can't leave.  How can you have douche chills if you leave?  Hey, he's got 50%.  What can I tell you?  I can fucking leave. 
[03:58:30]  He's got 50%.  What can I tell you?  Have fun.  I'm going to actually take a leak, I think.  Sam Kinison, everybody.  Keep it going for Sam Kinison.  Walk around.  I might go downstairs and get some air.  Hey, we have Sam Kinison in the studio tonight, too.  Hey, man.  How you doing, bud?  Pretty good.  Yeah, we're hanging out with the guys tonight.  That's a good impression, Anthony.  Hey, where are you going?  That's not a bad Kinison.  Yeah, today.  Oh, yeah.  He's walking down the hall, and he's mic'd by E-Rock.  By the way, this is no bit. 
[03:59:00]  Get away.  Don't look at me.  He's in the bathroom now.  I'm going to take a piss.  Nope.  No one allowed.  This seriously, honestly, is one of the, I think, as an entertainer, is one of the toughest  things you could do is just bring out, like, after you've achieved the level of success  and then bring out just when you sucked and just totally take away that whole illusion 
[03:59:30]  that you were always good.  It's fucking brutal.  It's no joke.  But the thing is, is he's not that bad.  That Sam sounded good.  You know who loves listening to their old stuff?  People that have failed in entertainment.  They love yanking out the tapes and the videos and showing their friends, like, hey, look  what I did.  And they show old stand-up because they never got better.  Or Bob Kelly, in his case, who's just doing the same jokes.  Most people really get the deuce chills, though, every time you look at their old stuff.  You're kind of supposed to.  You want to hear the Sam Kinison while he's in the bathroom? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, it wasn't a bad Kinison.  Yeah.  Tonight, too.  Sam.  Hey, old man.  How you doing, bud?  Pretty good.  Yeah, we're hanging out with the guys tonight, having a good time.  From Rodgut?  Yeah, I'm hoping that pizza comes down.  I'm losing a little weight being dead.  Hey, Sam, what do you think of O.J. Simpson?  I'm guilty as sin.  I was talking to Nicole and her waiter friend.  Yeah, she said he came up, looked pretty angry, stuck a knife in her.  You know, the whole deal.  Okay.  Very good.  Speaking of which, I think it's time to do Gun Electric Shock O.J. live on the night. 
[04:00:30]  Okay, that got a little bad.  Let's get right to my time attitude.  It's Rodgut.  Check this out.  Popeye Kinison.  He said Popeye Kinison.  And cut.  Whoa, whoa, what do you do?  Whoa, what are you doing?  That's what you were worried about.  You do something, he said.  Honestly, we're seven minutes in.  All right, well, that's going to have to wait for another time.  You do something bad?  Oh, good.  We got to the point, the guys got to remember, we got seven minutes in, finally. 
[04:01:00]  Right after Kinison.  And right after Kinison, they're about to play Gun Electric Shock O.J. live, which is not  bad whatsoever.  That was the song that brought Anthony to my attention.  I started playing the song, and then this is their first visit on the show.  What was it about his first time in there, seriously, that made you think?  His voices and just how quick he was.  It was amazing how quick he was.  You know, when you're a radio guy, you're always hoping to find someone you can bounce  off of, and whatever we were talking about, he had something to say about it.  Well, I didn't know about his thing back then, so he was still in the band with Joe? 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, and he was a tin knocker and all that, yeah.  So did Joe know that he actually wanted to get into radio?  Joe was the one that kind of pushed it.  Joe was the one that would show up at the back door at BAB banging on the door.  I'm like, oh, it's this Joe guy again.  Joe was plugging the band constantly.  Just pushing hard, and you might want to play this on the show.  And unlike the Godsmack debauchery, I actually listened to the stuff and went, holy shit,  is this stuff good?  They were great at song parties.  What happened?  Godsmack gave you a tape way back in the day, and he didn't listen? 
[04:02:00]  I threw it in a river.  Threw it out the window.  So he was a friend of our show.  He would come on a lot.  Oops.  And he was doing some kind of drum, what is it called?  Solo?  No, like a, what's the word?  Circle?  Snare drum.  Bass drum.  Seminar.  High hat.  Like a seminar, like a clinic.  A drum clinic, and we broadcasted live because there was a big client up there at one of  the music stores.  Yes, we did. 
[04:02:30]  Trying to be like the old Anthony.  And then, yeah, he's like, hey, there's my new project.  And he gave us a disc.  He gave everybody in Boston a disc.  A disc, yeah.  At that point, we were, so, at that point, we were, we listened to so many band tapes,  it's like, no one is going to give us anything that's worth listening to at this point.  So my friend was in the car with me, I said, dude, roll down the window, and I actually  threw it into the, I think it's called the Connecticut River, officially, that goes  through Boston, and threw it.  And then, that same tape was given to another jock at AAF, and he basically broke the band, 
[04:03:00]  and every article that was written about Godsmack for the first three years, they mentioned  this guy.  They mentioned this guy as the guy that broke the band.  Because one day, he just decided, the story goes, I don't know how true it is, he decided  to play it on his own.  You know, this, this, uh...  Yeah.  Was it Rocco?  Yeah, it was Rocco.  Yeah, dude.  All right, Ant, we're seven minutes in.  You're playing Gun Electric Shock OJ Live.  You want to hear that, or you want to bail?  I don't, you know something? 
[04:03:30]  Let's go get it over with.  I did not want to hear the Sam Kinison.  So you're all right with that?  I'm glad I wasn't in the room.  All right, you're all right with that?  Because it's awful.  It was like, it was like just set up, and hey, look who's in the studio.  And then I, you know, I had to do it.  I wanted to, you know, perform.  It was kind of throwing a, like a fish to the seal.  Yeah, it was the performing seal.  So I had to do it, but there really wasn't any context to it, and it's just embarrassing.  The fun part of that was the beginning when you went, uh, yeah, hi, Opie. 
[04:04:00]  Like, you said hi to Opie as Sam.  All right.  You know something, Jimmy?  Why?  I wish that was the fun part.  Yeah.  I love Jimmy.  There's a few people saying that, you know, this stuff is better than most shows on radio today.  Oh, shut up.  Who is calling the deaf?  This is awful.  Fucking awful.  I'm a fucking idiot.  I think O'Darn. 
[04:04:30]  I'm a fucking idiot.  O'Darn is a funny clip to have, like, in the box.  All right.  I do.  You should hit that sometime.  That's actually a silly one to have.  It's silly.  It's nothing as worse than shut up.  Oh, that's a one-second sound clip.  Yeah, but we don't really have that.  See, it's the authentic tape.  Yeah, if you actually had that moment of embarrassment.  All right.  Why don't we, um, you want to hear Gun Electric Shock OJ live?  This is the song that.  This was live, huh?  This is live, and this is the reason we do a show to this day.  Oh, we got to hear this. 
[04:05:00]  This was back when.  This is the song we talk about in articles from time to time.  OJ, of course, we know what OJ did.  And before his trial, though, everybody knew he was guilty and assumed that he'd be put  to death, death penalty, and that's what the song was kind of about.  And, uh, yeah, in hindsight, this song really.  And you've taken a beating.  I've been relatively unscathed here, except for O'Darn and the nighttime attitude and  a couple of dumb things, but I do have a motive here.  I'm trying to get to the point that will completely make me leave and that douche. 
[04:05:30]  Well, that'll probably come with an end of a phone call or something.  And I think we're heading toward a phone call, so I'm not really sure.  Toward disaster.  So here's, uh, Rockette doing Gun Electric Shock OJ live back in 94.  Joe's very good guitar work.  I'm sitting in Los Angeles jail.  And that judge won't let me post my bill. 
[04:06:00]  Now, this could be the end of me.  Cause California's got that death penalty.  They gone electric shock OJ.  Cook my behind like a chicken croquet.  Ooh.  They gone electric shock OJ.  Toast my behind. 
[04:06:30]  Nicole, I really loved that girl.  But she had the worst luck in the world.  I was only cleaning my knife.  I accidentally stabbed her 36 times.  They gone electric shock OJ.  Cook my behind like a cherry flambé. 
[04:07:00]  Ooh.  They gone electric shock OJ.  Toast my behind.  Looks like I'm a guilty man.  Love lots of women.  Now I'm gonna have to love my hands.  But what's worse?  What's make me flip my lid?  I hear Michael Jackson is watching my kids. 
[04:07:30]  Why don't they cut me some slack?  I'm an athlete, movie star, and I'm black.  Whilst lawyers argue over my hair.  Why they be warming up that electrical chair.  Ooh.  They gone electric shock OJ.  Cook my behind like a flounder fillet. 
[04:08:00]  Ooh.  They gone electric shock OJ.  Across my behind.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  That hurts.  It hurts.  Give me a call.  Give me the hell out of here.  I was in Chicago.  I swear I wasn't even near the girl.  Woo.  Ah.  Woo.  Ah.  Woo.  Woo.  Ah.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Ah. 
[04:08:30]  They gone electric shock OJ.  Boy, I do that whistle better than any better.  Bravo.  That's good improv.  That was not written by a professional.  That was a slower version of the song, by the way.  Now.  You slowed it down slightly.  Well.  It really wasn't that bad, Ant.  Well, you know.  The shocking sound effects.  Like, in 1994, it was topical.  It was very topical.  I really want to get to a phone call. 
[04:09:00]  It's not bad, dude.  I mean, it's like, the guitar work is actually really impressive, and it's like, it's not  right.  Joe can play anything.  He's great.  Joe's an amazing guitarist.  Anything.  He's amazing.  I, uh, I will start, uh, banning, um, critics on PalTalk.  Uh, here.  First of all, just as a, like a warning, I'm just firing a random shot.  Boom!  You're bounced.  Look at that.  Just somebody out of nowhere.  So I, I wield my iron fist. 
[04:09:30]  What kind of critics?  What are they criticizing?  It was written by a guy who was not a professional comic.  It was, you were a guy who just fucking, who had a knocking tin, and you wrote a song.  Thanks for your sympathy.  But that's true, though.  Like, I was doing comedy for, I was on television when I did what I did.  You were just a guy with his brother who fucking wound up blowing up into a radio star.  I was on television.  I was in comedy.  He's helping me.  But it's the truth.  Believe me, there's nothing I want more than to trash you. 
[04:10:00]  But it's not accurate.  I want to, I want to, I want to, uh, let's see if we can move on here.  I want to get, get out of this.  We're almost there.  No.  I'm not that bad, Anthony.  Keep playing it.  Hey, Joe, I think you did whistle better than me.  We're hanging out with Rod Good on the Nighttime Attitude.  They got a song about the guy that crashed into the, into the White House.  Oh, that kook.  That we're going to debut in a, in a few that you're going to love.  And if you've got something to add to the program tonight, give us a call.  955-WBA-Bay.  A touch is going to make it true. 
[04:10:30]  102% Long Island.  We're WBA.  That's more than 100%.  That's a lot of Long Island folks.  Well, there's a small 2% no one talks about.  I figured I'd, uh,  It's a small little town in the middle of Long Island that doesn't get any attention.  What's even better is the awful music you're coming out of, into that crap.  This is unbearable, dude.  Look how red you are.  You're totally red. 
[04:11:00]  I'm fucking sweating.  I am sweating.  100.  I can't sit through this.  102%.  102%, yeah.  Look how red you are.  And it was a home of rock and roll.  I worked for three homes of rock and roll over the years.  Nice.  That's a long time attitude.  I worked for,  I think I worked for two stations named after animals.  And one station that really rocks.  955-WBA-Bay.  102% Long Island. 
[04:11:30]  We're WBAB Babylon,  WHFM Southampton.  Thanking everyone in Hop Hog for showing the world they love rock and roll.  Uh-oh.  Yo, BAB.  Hey, kiddo.  How you doing?  Mickey James.  I got to tell you about this.  Well.  Oh, by the way.  Bit over in 30 seconds.  I know.  I'm kind of thinking back now and going, 
[04:12:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Fucking T.  Uh-oh.  Bit over in 30 seconds.  But, uh.  This is so bad.  Mickey.  I can't.  Mickey, uh.  Because you're going to forget about Mickey J by the end of this phone call,  unfortunately.  But Mickey J was a raging alcoholic from Montauk that, uh,  unfortunately died.  He drank too much and ended up going for a swim.  And they never found his body.  Uh, but, um, he used to call my show all the time.  And he was called the, uh, the mayor of Montauk, I believe.  He was one of those guys everybody knew. 
[04:12:30]  Everyone knew him.  He was drunk.  And he would always come up with some hilarious, just dumb thing.  Yeah, he had, like, uh, uh, his own weird take on the news of the day.  Unfortunately, not going to remember that in a few seconds here, but.  No.  Hey, kiddo.  How you doing?  Mickey J!  Yeah, what's happening?  The mayor of Montauk.  How are you, bro?  Uh, what do you think about the OJ now, man?  And the DNA came in and said his blood is true.  His blood is true?  Yeah.  It's his blood.  What do you mean his blood is true? 
[04:13:00]  Well, they said with their DNA.  Right.  They said it's his blood that was on the path of his house there.  You better find some good drugs, OJ.  Don't fool yourself, boys, going up your poop tube.  Wait, what was that line again?  Don't fool yourself, boys, going up your poop tube.  Hey, tell Rocco, save me a piece of, uh, pizza when he comes out this weekend. 
[04:13:30]  Who's Rocco?  Your buddy's there, right?  They ordered a pizza.  Hey, it's Rocco's pizza.  Well, that would be Rocco, but close enough, bro.  You want to sing a song tonight, buddy?  Well, how about a little Zeppelin?  Rocco wants to play while you sing.  Okay, go, man, go.  All right.  Which one do you want to sing?  Good times, bad times?  Yeah, there you go.  All right, whenever you're ready, bro.  Okay.  Go, man, go.  In my days of my youth, I was told what I need to be a man. 
[04:14:00]  Now, by the time's now, you know I have my share.  When the woman comes around again, I don't care.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mickey J.  Yeah. 
[04:14:30]  All right, good.  Done.  What happened?  What?  I'm safe.  Yeah.  I don't know what.  I'm safe for now.  The Mickey J call was fine.  Yeah, I know.  I'm safe.  Mickey J was very funny, yeah.  I'm safe.  He was all drunk and singing.  So what do you say from?  What do we miss?  Exactly.  I'm safe.  Yeah.  Until next time.  What'd you do?  Yeah.  We can't dwell on this.  Come on.  How about a teaser?  How about a teaser?  I'm safe.  What happened?  Just a teaser. 
[04:15:00]  What is the...  Because I really don't know what it is.  What is the...  Mickey J actually did it, but I didn't do it, so I'm safe for now.  We've already given them 102% of this pick.  I don't want any more.  Enough.  All right.  Secure this, then, for next time.  Secure it.  Yeah, I don't mind.  Put it in the fucking garbage.  I don't mind for now.  Hide that.  Make sure Ant doesn't see where you put that.  No, I'm safe for now.  We'll just keep it like that.  I wouldn't destroy a relic like that. 
[04:15:30]  I've been doing this a long time.  This is called the ultimate tease.  Now people are going to be like, oh, it's safe for more.  They heard a little more.  They heard a little more.  They got to hear a little more.  There's actually another...  There's like three more tracks.  Let me see.  All right.  There's like four left on that track, then another nine.  That's 13, then another 10.  That's 23, and another 12.  We have about 35 more minutes to get to the end of that.  No way I could sit through 35 minutes.  We did 12 today.  That's the best we've done so far. 
[04:16:00]  That's a long piece.  That is long since we could not make it through like a minute the first time we did this.  But I did have to leave.  I left my post.  We literally, the first time when we tried, he punched out after, I don't even think  it was a minute.  I think it was like 20 seconds.  It was hello.  It was my first like, hey.  And then he threatened to quit the show.  We had a hack.  No joke.  He was like...  You weren't a hack.  You were too young to be a hack.  A hack is a guy that does old stuff over and over.  You were just eager.  You were a douche.  There's a difference.  Let's say hi to Brent in Rhode Island. 
[04:16:30]  Brent?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's up, Brent?  Hey, you guys need to mix some of these awful old lines with a little Roger Daltry scream.  Oh, yeah.  You need some of that CSI scream?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  A little CSI with some of these old bits.  There you go.  Very good.  All right, listen.  A lot of people want us to continue, but that's a good place to leave it for now.  For now.  Yeah.  See, we gave him more than we've ever given before.  If the thing I'm talking about was right around the corner, I really don't know.  I would have no problem throwing myself under the bus, but for now, we'll just keep it 
[04:17:00]  there.  We gave you enough.  If you don't like what you see here, get the funk out.  Why?  You know what's funny?  I've got to watch that show now.  I don't get it.  I guess in the beginning.  Yeah.  Yeah, just the beginning.  We've got Tippi Tom from PalTalk.  Yes, Tippi Tom?  Yeah, can I speak to 102% Sam Kinison, please? 
[04:17:30]  Fuck off.  I don't know if that was 102% Sam.  That was more like 12% Sam.  12% Sam.  I've never hung up on people faster in my life, by the way.  88% excited douche.  Excited drunk douche.  That spiraled out of Sam voice quickly.  It was kind of I miss Popeye Sam.  You know, Jimmy, thanks.  But it was, you were young.  You do brilliant impressions.  Oh.  I can't hang up on these people fast enough.  Jeremy in Cleveland, what's up? 
[04:18:00]  Hey, guys.  102% homo rock and roll.  Is that the rate of your fucking T-cells dropping?  Faggots?  All right.  The rate of T-cells dropping at 102%.  It's a little harsh, sir.  Yeah, I love that.  Really?  Hope was excited.  Aunt was excited.  Don't usually call them homosexuals.  Let's go to John in Jersey, John.  Early radio and comparing it to the AIDS virus is a bit much.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yes, John.  Hey, what's up, man?  I've never seen the phones ring quicker in my life, by the way.  You haven't given 102%.  You've got to keep going. 
[04:18:30]  Frankas.  All right, listen.  Let's take a break.  I've got to tingle.  That's a good idea.  I always like hearing from the college.  I've got to just lay back and breathe.  Opie, I think a big part of this show is interaction.  I would love to hear from a couple more.  All right, let's say, all right, you want interaction?  Here you go.  Josh in Tennessee.  Josh.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just want to remind y'all, this is why y'all are millionaires.  Why are y'all complaining?  Oh, yeah.  No, it isn't.  All right, thanks.  I mean, I would do anything in the world to be where you guys are today. 
[04:19:00]  Is this Dr. Phil's first tape?  I know, right?  Wow, this guy really sounds like Dr. Phil.  Bill Burr, you are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And now, The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Nice. 
[04:19:30]  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on The Opie and Anthony Show.  Dude, he's dancing.  Yes, I am.  I'm good.  Let me dance, too.  Oh.  Opie's dancing.  Opie, I don't think I'm going to dance.  Opie dances like the father in fame when he parks the cab, the two arms going up.  That's my son!  Playing Bruno Martelli.  Easy.  Opie's actually danced in public.  What are you talking about?  You've danced at, like, clubs.  What are you talking about?  When you go out, you have a little too many, maybe. 
[04:20:00]  I don't dance in clubs.  Even as a joke.  Do you hear what you're saying?  Even as a joke.  I don't even go to clubs.  But you've done it.  Not a dance club.  A bar, let's say.  A song will come on, and you'll start doing your little dance.  Opie's a raver.  Well, that's a lot different than going, I go to clubs and dance, you ass.  Is it a club?  Now the Photoshop's are going to start going nuts.  They're going to have me as freaking John Travolta.  Go to opianthony.com to get to all our fan sites, by the way.  You didn't call me, Opie.  No, I'll do a little bounce thing from the side at a regular bar, you ass. 
[04:20:30]  That's what I'm talking about.  You said I go to clubs and dance.  It's a club, but you're dancing a little.  That's all I'm saying.  That's what you do.  You do that little backwards thing.  The little backwards thing.  You actually do move.  No, I raise my hands in the air like I just don't care.  You do like a move, though.  It's not different every time.  So you have a dance, and it's at a club.  I do a little bounce.  It's a little bounce, but it's not at a club. 
[04:21:00]  No, those hands are involved.  If you just did a bounce, that's one thing.  But hands are involved.  Kenny's seen it.  Kenny knows.  Kenny, can you do it?  Are you crazy?  You guys are crazy.  I am not crazy.  Watch Jimmy.  Jimmy's got it down.  Jimmy's got it.  There it is.  I don't do that.  That's the dance.  That's what we call the Opie dance.  I don't do that, you hooker-loving ass.  It's almost a Davy Jones skate with something else thrown in I can't quite figure out.  Ben.  Ben.  With a little bit of Ben Sparks twitch. 
[04:21:30]  You guys have lost your mind.  Do the Ben.  I do a little bounce.  Do the Ben.  I do a little bounce because I'm feeling the rhythm.  Next thing you know, I'm dancing in clubs.  Are you insane?  I meant out in public.  You know what that entails?  I meant out in public at a bar.  When a song comes on the jukebox, you'll do that move.  For 10 seconds.  It's long enough.  Maybe.  What I was getting to was the point that I don't dance.  Not at weddings, not at anything. 
[04:22:00]  And the fact that, you know, you should be proud that you're that open.  I don't dance!  You do.  How come everyone can do it then?  I don't know.  Ben.  Ben's doing it.  You guys had a secret meeting before I got here.  It's obvious.  No, we didn't.  Time to throw Opio under the bus.  No.  Again.  You dance.  It's all right.  Secret meetings going on.  I'm convinced of it.  Secret room.  No, it came up.  Secret room with secret meetings.  Okay.  I'll explain. 
[04:22:30]  You don't have to.  It's cool.  But clubs.  Maybe I made it sound like you were going down to the disco.  Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch.  Ellen's got nothing on OP.  Oh, no.  What did I do to you, Cigars and Scotch?  Does that make him dancing on in the beginning of the show?  I've done nothing but support you, my friend.  And you throw him under a bus.  Billy and Jersey, what's up?  Didn't I see you doing the electric slide at FH Riley?  See you later, Bert. 
[04:23:00]  Can I be here?  Of course, I will take advantage of that.  FH Riley's is the fine restaurant I own with my brothers in Huntington, 400 New York Avenue  in Huntington Village.  And no, I do not do the electric slide at that fine establishment.  Perhaps after a couple of glasses of wine or something, maybe you get to see OP do his moves.  Just karaoke, right?  Now everyone's going to be looking at me to see if I do a little thing.  I've seen you do it at FH Riley's.  I've seen you leaning against the wall. 
[04:23:30]  What?  Doing the little back.  It's like the shoulders kind of roll back.  You know, it's kind of like a little relaxed shoulder roll.  Ah.  Yeah, I think this was one of the songs.  It's the only time I feel like someone when I'm dancing, dancing down at the disco.  Hope he gets in the car with a double J.  A net cigarette. 
[04:24:00]  What the F?  I've just seen you do the moves, even at FH Riley's.  You were leaning against the wall one day.  And a song came on.  And you just like, you put on the face and you got the arms going.  And I'm like, yeah, I'm just feeling it.  I'm just feeling the groove.  I do a little bounce.  But there are arms.  Bounces like you're making it sound like you're river dancing.  Ben just actually handed me a funny note.  No way.  Hope he goes raving at crowbar with glow sticks. 
[04:24:30]  Well, Bert and Philly, the Opie dance is your chance.  Do the Opie.  Do the Opie.  The Opie.  Do the Opie.  Opie.  We've just all seen it.  That's all.  Yeah, yeah.  Great.  Great.  Hey, back's going to be a bitch.  Trust me.  I'm not saying anything that just we all haven't seen. 
[04:25:00]  It's the move.  The Opie dance.  It's not wrong with it.  We all have our own little things.  Nothing.  Everyone gets a little chuckle out of it.  It's funny.  We know you're not seriously, you know, dancing.  I could be on the next episode of So You Think You Can Dance.  This is inside probably, but we don't feel like explaining everything on this show.  Bert and Philly, this weekend at FH Riley's.  No filter Paul to Opie.  Why don't you call me, Opie?  Call me.  I hope it ends the same way with him plummeting from a bridge. 
[04:25:30]  That stupid Lego person wig flying off his head.  Big platform shoes.  Walking down the sidewalk crying.  That's what I want to see.  No filter Paul dressed in white 70s clothing with platform shoes.  Big platform shoes and gold chains.  White platform shoes.  Perhaps an Elvis cape.  Let's say hi to Chris in West Point.  Chris.  Yeah, he was looking like Buffalo Bill dancing. 
[04:26:00]  James Grumb.  What did you say?  Did I say James?  James, of course I did.  James.  Yeah, yeah, James.  James Grumb.  But there is a fine little dance sequence in the new Clerks 2 movie that made me laugh out loud.  What did you say?  Let's go to Dan in Boston.  Dan, what's up?  Sorry.  I got to do the thing here.  Touching his own nipple with his stupid, dirty mechanic fingernails.  She's a great big fat person. 
[04:26:30]  Mrs. Littman.  Mrs. Littman.  I think I got a card inside.  Jack Gordon.  You need help with that?  Would you?  Thank you.  Greatest character ever.  Oh, what a doll he was.  Dan, hold on one second.  Tony from a lake in New Jersey.  I cannot pronounce.  Ronkonkoma?  No, no, wait.  Lake...  Hopatakon.  Lake Apakon.  Lake Apakon.  Apakon.  Lake Apakon.  Lake Apakon.  I don't know.  It starts with an H. 
[04:27:00]  H-O-P-A-T-C-O-N-G.  Apakon.  Apakon.  Lake Apakon.  Oh.  Stinks.  Another Indian name.  Exactly.  The Indians got screwed.  We took their land and then just named things after them.  It's Lake Ten Bucks.  Now beat it.  Right.  Take these anthrax blankets with you.  Exactly.  Keep you warm.  Lake, here's a bead.  Tell your story walking, fella.  Tony's on to something.  Opie can't dance because his wallet keeps him off balance.  That's all you're seeing.  That's all you're really seeing there is me just trying to keep everything balanced. 
[04:27:30]  What I should do is start carrying two wallets in my back pocket.  Right.  Dan in Boston, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I got an old WAF Real Rock TV tape in it.  Opie and Anthony had a WAF event and Opie's dancing in the background to one of the songs.  He looked like a total jackass.  Wow.  Classic.  You don't have that.  Yeah.  You had Billy Idol in the studio doing an orgasm or having some girl do an orgasm for him. 
[04:28:00]  Right.  And then you guys were at the Bayside Expo Center and Opie was doing like a skateboard thing,  but it wasn't really him skateboarding.  Oh, I remember that bit.  That was funny.  It was me.  It was you.  It was Opie right at the lip of a half pipe.  Shut up.  It was me the whole time.  And he'd like jump off.  And then he switched clothes with this kid who was really good.  And he's like, he's got a hood pulled up over his head.  And he's doing some like some rad moves on this half pipe. 
[04:28:30]  And then he comes flying up.  And of course, it cuts back to Opie going, ha, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But when it cuts back to me, I'm supposed to be at the bottom of the half pipe.  Yeah.  You know, and I fell on my ass and pretty much messed up my back pretty bad.  I couldn't even do that part of the bit.  There was no real skateboarding in that without dying.  I want a copy of that video.  What gave it away is your shoes changed.  Oh, there's a whole series.  My shoes changed?  Yeah.  When it panned to the guy going down the half pipe, it was a different colored shoe. 
[04:29:00]  Continuity error.  Yeah.  Son of a...  All right, boys, you rock.  All right, Dan, send that tape in if you have it.  We'll throw it up on the website.  What the hell?  I'd love to see some of that old Real Rock TV stuff.  I got all of them.  I got all of them.  Do you?  I got every episode.  Are you kidding?  I save everything.  Okay, one day you're going to have to let me borrow them so I can put them on a DVD.  Invite me to your house and I'll bring them over.  You're cordially invited.  This Sunday. 
[04:29:30]  Sunday?  I got plans.  Saturday?  I got plans.  Tony, you don't call me.  No, I'll call you.  They're on VHS.  I got to switch them over before they run out.  They rot.  They're going to run out of VHS machines soon.  I got dats.  I got this.  I got dats.  Ow!  Once again, the Greg O.B. Hughes Literature Society presents another informative book review. 
[04:30:00]  What do you say, keep it by the what?  Man, I forgot.  What do you say, keep it by the what?  By the shitter.  Oh.  What do you say, keep it by the the Pit Guy?  What do you say? 
[04:30:30]  What do you say, keep it by the Pit Guy?  Oh, Jesus.  Wait for it.
