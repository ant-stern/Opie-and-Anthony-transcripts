<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts ribbing a co-worker's bathroom habits, followed by the announcement and welcoming back of Troy Kwan and E-Rock.  Kwan's recent nose job and E-Rock's fake sunburn (attributed to an Instagram filter mishap) were heavily joked about, alongside numerous gags related to E-Rock's WrestleMania trip and lobster.  A humorous comparison of modern and 80s technology ensued, spurred by a viral video showing a rudimentary 80s-style Twitter interface, triggering nostalgic reminiscing about Atari and Commodore 64 computers.

The conversation dramatically shifted to one host's frustrating traffic stop on the Long Island Expressway by an MTA police officer, who issued a ticket for allegedly failing to use a turn signal. The host vehemently argued the ticket's unfairness, focusing on the officer's perceived personal offense and the disputed infraction.  Callers, including a New York City police officer, weighed in, discussing the inconsistencies and attitudes often observed within the MTA police force and sharing their own anecdotes about navigating similar situations.

Next, a viral video depicting a tow truck and tractor-trailer plunging down a snowy cliff, with the tow truck driver miraculously escaping, dominated the discussion.  This segued into a discussion of Yankee GM Brian Cashman and his stalker, comparing the disproportionate consequences faced by male versus female stalkers.  Finally, humorous speculation about the menu items at the upcoming Gene Simmons Rock and Brew restaurant concluded this segment.

The next segment opened with a discussion about The Gap Band, unexpectedly transitioning to the anniversary of the Unabomber's arrest,  the long-term holding of a stock, and the death of Jesse James.  The focus then turned to Kenny's severe seasonal allergies and his struggle to administer eyedrops, leading to discussion about his eating habits and reluctance to accept help.  Troy Kwan joined the show, providing a graphic account of his recent nose surgery, its recovery process, including swelling and nasal packing removal, all while enduring relentless teasing from the hosts.  A caller then detailed his experience with sleep apnea and the pillar procedure, a dental solution to the condition, complete with a description of his uvula being cut in half.  The hosts discussed the upcoming appearance of Jim Abbott, a one-handed baseball player, and his book signing, interspersing the discussion with anecdotes, including one about a Florida detective using cheeseburgers to negotiate with a prostitute.  Jim Abbott briefly joined the show, discussing his career and the challenges of playing baseball with one hand.

The interview with Jim Abbott detailed his career, his 1993 no-hitter, the unique challenges of pitching one-handed, his experiences with different teams, the media's portrayal of him, his post-baseball life, and childhood anecdotes.  Following the interview, Abbott's impressive statistics were discussed, before transitioning to a comedic segment featuring Ted's absurd sleep apnea mask designs.  The show concluded with a discussion of Brock Lesnar's WWE return and attack on John Cena, speculating on the storyline implications,  comparing The Rock's successful film career to Adam Sandler's *Jack and Jill*, and contrasting box office success with production budgets. A caller briefly shared a personal anecdote about reading about Abbott in college.

The final segment began with the revelation of Bob Kelly's appearance on Monday Night Raw, sparking vulgar jokes and banter about wrestling, websites, and Kelly's physique.  Opie's new swimming pool and upcoming summer parties provided a transition point to stories about past skiing trips, including an anecdote involving a sales representative known as "Crazy Jim" and his exhibitionism.  A substantial portion focused on Opie's search for a summer house, fueled by listener suggestions, resulting in a chaotic exchange of ideas, locations, and vulgar jokes punctuated by E-Rock's club music. Speculation about potential changes at Sirius XM, spurred by the presence of executives, and continued discussion about Opie's summer house search, interspersed with more club music and vulgar jokes, concluded the show, hinting at a possible end to the program.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Missing good morning guy every morning now.  Yeah, well, he was in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Good morning. Got my dick in my hand. Good morning.  He's proper.  Taking a dump morning. Good morning.  He's very proper, though.  Welcome aboard the toilet.  You know when he washes his hands after he takes his dump?  Yeah.  He puts paper towel around his collar and stuff. 
[00:00:30]  He's one of those guys.  He's one of those guys.  Makeup's done.  He's very proper.  He doesn't want any water on any of his shirts or ties.  He's got to look the part, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep.  He rocks back.  Troy Kwan is back.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we'll have to get into that a little later.  I'm back with the show.  Well, I still have black eyes. 
[00:01:00]  Does he?  A little bit?  A little bit, a little bit.  Yeah, we'll have to get into him a little later.  And I looked at his nose job just now, and he doesn't like it to be referred as a nose  job.  No.  I go, turn sideways.  Turn sideways.  I go, so there was a bump there, huh?  I said, I don't know.  Did he have a bump on his nose?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was the cosmetic part of the surgery, to shave the bump down and smooth  it out.  And he said it was crooked, so they straightened it out for him.  Right.  All right, we'll take a look at Troy Kwan's nose a little later. 
[00:01:30]  And then E-Rock's back as well, and his face isn't a sunburn.  Dino's back.  E-Rock, your face isn't a sunburn.  No, it's not.  That was very deceiving.  If you weren't listening yesterday, E-Rock chose to go to WrestleMania on his own dime.  On his own dime.  On his own dime.  And then chose not to have himself ready for our show yesterday.  Ooh.  Yeah.  You could have gave us some great shit early in the morning when it mattered.  Yeah.  But he did tweet a picture of his face extremely red with Mr. Cowhead, who was dressed like 
[00:02:00]  a gentleman.  A gentleman.  He was very dapper.  He was very.  He was dressed like he was going to a wake.  Dapper damn.  I don't know.  He was so, he was like the most overdressed person outside of any official that had to  be there dressed up.  He takes his wrestling seriously.  And he's, I don't, I should have asked him what he was wearing, but he did smell great.  Yeah.  Probably bacon.  But he was dressed like a gentleman.  And then you're taking a picture with Mr. Cowhead and your face is beet red. 
[00:02:30]  And we had lots of lobster jokes, courtesy of Jim Norton yesterday.  Yes.  And thank you to everybody who retweeted those jokes to me.  No problem.  Any cool photoshops?  Lobster with E-Rock's head on it.  Yeah.  Claws.  Marr, marr, marr, marr.  It will be now.  Ah.  But then it turns out he's walking around here and his face doesn't look too bad.  Nah.  So then once again he's trying to explain because he, you know, used the fucking iPhone where  you, you know.  Put on the sunburn filter.  Yeah.  Use the sunburn app.  Instagram. 
[00:03:00]  Does Instagram have a sunburn filter?  An Instagram filter.  That's for hipsters.  Oh, you don't, you don't Instagram.  Nah.  I tried it.  I didn't like it.  That means you don't have skills.  You can't just put a filter on.  You have to have skills as well.  Doesn't that interfere with your Twitter?  That's kind of why I stopped doing it because I'm like, I can just Twitter this stuff.  Yeah, of course.  Well, it's a place to put your pictures up where everybody can see them and it's there.  I Twitter it.  Bobby Kelly.  Bobby Kelly does the cool filters and stuff.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  How many characters on?  228.  8 billion. 
[00:03:30]  I didn't realize.  Oh, 8 billion.  Much more room to operate.  Did you see the, uh, welcome back, E-Rock.  We don't have anything for you today.  Just enjoy yourself.  Believe me, vice versa.  We'll get to you eventually.  Trust me.  Uh, did you get, did you see the video, speaking of Twitter, of, um, it's going viral too?  It's, it's Twitter from the 80s?  Oh, no.  I haven't seen that one.  It's hilarious.  That is funny.  It's old school, though.  It's, it's, it's literally, if Twitter was in the 80s, what you would have to do.  Have you seen it?  It's visual.  That's pretty funny.  That's why we need a visual element for the show. 
[00:04:00]  A visual elephant?  Back to E-Rock?  Oh, wait.  A visual element.  Fuck it, we're going to, I'll play this for you anyway.  If Twitter would have been invented in the 80s.  Oh, that's funny.  The old school Twitter graphics, you'd have to sign on first.  Ah, with the blue bar going on the bottom.  Right.  The graphics are really bad.  That's funny.  It's like Atari.  I guess someone found just an old computer so they could do this.  Oh, man, it's got like the F1 Home, F2 Connect.  Just, and there's the Twitter screen. 
[00:04:30]  Wow, it's just a bunch of.  Remember, everyone's fonts were different colors.  Different colors and stuff.  There's a green, a red, a blue.  It's really terrible.  An orange, a yellow.  And look, that's your screen to fucking tweet.  Wow.  We'll put this on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  It looks like you're typing in a very old chat room and then the little window pops up.  Yeah, they're not fucking around.  This is exactly what you would have had to do, excuse me, in the 80s for Twitter.  Warning. 
[00:05:00]  And then there's warnings for viruses and.  That's funny.  That really looks.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  Good job.  Good job.  Unfortunately, a lot of us being children of the 80s, we remember this.  I remember, yeah.  Do you remember any of that shit?  That's looked foreign to you, right?  I mean, I remember it a little bit.  Atari 800?  You guys must have been smart kids to using computers like this.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Programming a little basic on your Atari 800 or your Commodore 64? 
[00:05:30]  My junior high had one of the first fucking computers when I was growing up in the 80s.  Big floppy disk?  Yep.  Right?  Although one computer was one big fucking room.  Yeah, yeah.  They had to have a separate room to fire up the computers.  Wow.  Remember that?  Yeah.  How small everything is now.  It's ridiculous.  It's amazing.  The fucking, what's stronger than the NASA computers that they put Apollo 13 up with?  My new Android phone?  Yeah.  Any of your phones have more memory and are faster than the computers in the actual lunar 
[00:06:00]  module.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's just amazing.  What are they doing there?  Well, they couldn't play games, so they were very bored.  That was all trajectory stuff, guidance, mostly guidance, yeah.  But then there were systems on board, all their life support stuff, all that, like fucking  just on this shitty little computer they had back then that barely, I swear, your phone  has to be a thousand times better than that computer. 
[00:06:30]  Really?  At least, yeah.  Wow.  Just faster.  It was slow?  Yeah, slow and not much memory either.  Yeah, they squeezed everything on there that they needed.  I've told this before, but when I bought my first Toshiba laptop, I walked into the store  and I didn't understand gigs.  The guy goes, this is six gigabytes.  Whoa.  You're never going to need more than this.  I know.  I'll never forget that.  He's like, you can put hundreds or thousands of songs. 
[00:07:00]  What?  And I couldn't believe, like six gigabytes.  I wrapped my mind around it.  What are we up to now, eight?  No, I'm six.  I hover around seven.  I just bought a 64 fucking gigabyte thumb drive.  Yeah.  It's like fucking a thumb drive and you just leave it on your key chain and shit.  And if you ever need to just get something off a computer really fast, but that's not  up on cloud or anything like that, you just pop it in, but it's 64 gigs, which would  have been unheard of in the biggest fucking like desktop computer.  Right. 
[00:07:30]  It would have been huge.  First gigabyte I ever heard of was a friend of mine.  He's like, I have a gigabyte of memory.  This guy, Joe, he's a comic at Dangerfields.  I couldn't believe it.  We were like, what is that?  Right.  And he had put like a bunch of hard drives together.  Like he was a computer guy and was using three or four different hard drives to create a  game.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I remember the guys that used to fucking, what's his name?  That used to do real rock TV.  Yeah.  Fucking Ian.  Whatever.  Go fuck yourself.  He had in his.  By the way, another bridge I burned.  Oops.  In his studio, he had, it had to be a bank of probably 20 hard drives. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  To store the video.  For one half hour show.  For like one half hour show.  He'd have to wipe it after that and start over, start over.  Couldn't, couldn't hold anything.  Nah, I guess, I guess Ian's all right.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  He took AF side when we got fired.  Dope.  I ain't got no idea.  We were friends, you idiot.  Fucking friends become, you know, is more important than a radio station.  You're under a, you're under a burnt out rubble bridge and you got a little lighter 
[00:08:30]  right here.  And you're going, you know what?  I just realized, fuck him.  You're trying to light it back on fire again.  Fuck him.  That's your bridge building.  The only one that didn't take AF side at the time was Ozone.  Yeah.  He's like, this is crazy.  I like these guys.  I'm friends with them.  This is nuts.  He was the only one.  Everyone else took AF side and decided, oh, now we can never talk to them again.  Love the Ozone.  Stupid idiots.  Fucking be your own person, you idiot.  What happened there, Ian?  Fucking pulled over.  God damn it. 
[00:09:00]  What happened.  What happened?  Well, I got out of the Queens Midtown Tunnel onto the Long Island Expressway.  And I see a police vehicle, right?  But it's not NYPD.  And it's not a state-y.  It's not a sheriff.  It's not a...  It's...  I look at it and I think I see a lot of these postal police on the expressway.  What's...  What they do is they escort big postal trucks that I guess are handling some sensitive stuff. 
[00:09:30]  But what if you want to make a robbery movie?  I don't think you use the postal police.  Why not?  Who...  Fucking postal police.  They don't do shit.  Fucking postal police.  I want to make a robbery movie.  I want to take out a postal truck.  For my movie, of course.  I bet you'd have no problem with the postal police.  They just seem like they just follow a truck.  Oh, really?  That's the only one I've ever seen them do.  Are they kind of rent-a-cocks, you think?  Follow the truck.  Eh-huh.  You know, I don't know any postal police, so I'm sorry.  Well, you're going to...  You're going to hear from one or two in a few seconds here. 
[00:10:00]  Well, on the hierarchy of law enforcement, I don't think the postal police come up there  with the FBI, is all I'm saying.  I would gather it's some type of law enforcement that is protecting the...  You!  Seal that envelope!  Yeah, right.  Just another one-cent stamp on that!  But what are you going to get if you take out a postal truck?  A lot of stamps?  You could get payroll stuff.  Payroll?  You could get some sensitive documents, perhaps, that are en route to the United Nations, perhaps.  What if your little team got together, they take out a postal fucking truck, now you're 
[00:10:30]  in your safe house with the postal truck, and you open it up, and now there's like a million  dollars in stamps.  Now what do you do?  Oh, man.  You've got to find someone that's going to convert that shit for you?  You've got to off them to people that are writing letters.  Oh, my God!  Sell them it one stamp at a time.  Just like, yeah, man.  Well, wouldn't that...  You know, I got stamps.  Wouldn't that be a bummer?  I would think it would be a bummer.  Are there people out there that will do that for you?  No.  I don't know where it would come from.  I don't know about the black market stamp market. 
[00:11:00]  But how much of a drag would that be?  You know you have a million dollars, but it's in stamps.  Yeah.  All right.  But it wasn't a postal cop.  No, it wasn't a postal cop, and that's what got me, because this gentleman was driving.  He was an MTA police, which is the transit authority of New York City.  Right.  Not a bridge and tunnel guy.  He's an MTA.  The same fucking MTA you see on the side of the choo-choo trains.  So he's got his MTA car, and he's driving. 
[00:11:30]  I didn't know that MTA apparently has jurisdiction everywhere like a state trooper.  I didn't know that.  And I think it's been just recently, since there was some kind of death somewhere or shooting,  they gave the MTA this very wide berth, as far as their authority goes.  So now here's what I did, though.  Here's what I did.  But he was in front of me the whole tunnel, and then he comes out of the tunnel.  We go through the toll, and then I get in the left lane, and I pass him by. 
[00:12:00]  I pass him by, like I have many times with the postal police, or many times with, like,  correction cars, correctional guys, because a lot of cars, they just see lights on top of  the car, and they fucking jam on the brakes and do 40 miles an hour on the expressway,  because they see a car with lights.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Do you pass an NYPD tow truck?  Yes.  Of course.  Fucking blow past that guy.  Of course.  What the fuck is he doing?  I've seen people slam on the brakes. 
[00:12:30]  I'm like, really?  It's crazy.  It's a tow truck with NYPD on the side.  Those guys aren't, even if they try to take off and pull you over, it's not happening.  Just stop it.  You can blow by an NYPD tow truck.  That, I mean, it's...  I'll pass the cops if they're going slow, as long as I...  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's just it.  If they're doing, like, just under the limit, I'll go past them.  I'm not going to fly, but...  Just make sure you're 10 and 2, though, when you're passing.  They're watching carefully.  Watch for phones.  And have your seatbelt on.  So I pass them by, right?  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  And now I start doing my thing, my driving home thing, which it entails a lot of use  of the directional and a lot of, you know, lane changes to get around these fuckers  that have all bunched up from the tunnel, right?  Because they're idiots that think the tunnel walls are going to crumble in on them.  They got vehicles that are fucking tankers, and they can't stay in one lane.  People get so scared in the tunnels.  If you don't know the parameters of your vehicle to the point where you've got to jam on your  fucking brakes every two seconds and do 25-mile-an-hour in a tunnel, give me your fucking license. 
[00:13:30]  You don't deserve to have it.  Well, the wall does look a little closer than it is.  Fuck it.  Everyone should know the fucking dimensions of their vehicle.  Yeah, but couldn't they make the stupid tunnel a little wider?  I like it.  I know what you're saying.  It's like Battlestar Galactica when they used to take off in the ships.  But they were going to make the tunnel anyway.  Why didn't they make it bigger?  So stupid.  Back in the oldie days, they had cars going...  A little Model T's. 
[00:14:00]  Well, how about you think about the future and future men?  Ah.  Yeah.  Eventually, in the future, we might need wider tunnels.  You say you'd like a roomier tunnel?  Yes!  Maybe a bit more to look at, perhaps, visually pleasing?  Well, this one's going to be a little too local, but when you're going in the Lincoln Tunnel  and they decide they need to open up the other tunnel to get traffic through, so now you're  in the tiny tunnel and cars are coming right at you in the middle of the tunnel?  That's fucked up.  Is that a smaller...  Oh, I like that.  Well, the tunnel's as small as is, but at least it's one way, usually, but they have 
[00:14:30]  to open up the other lanes sometimes.  Yeah, so they've got three lanes coming in, one lane going out.  And now you've got cars flying right at you as you're in the tunnel.  Yeah.  But anyway, back to your story.  I'm sorry.  No, it's okay.  I'm sorry.  Discussing the abomination that is driving.  So I come out of the tunnel.  Now I've got to make my moves to get around this fucking pack.  And, you know, so I get past the MTA cop, which I'm not sure if he has any jurisdiction,  but he does, and I didn't know that.  So I go past him.  Now I'm going in and out.  Uh, so I get down, uh, I'm about a mile and a half, maybe two miles out of the tunnel 
[00:15:00]  already down the expressway.  And I see this fucking MTA cop coming up on me pretty quickly.  And I go, uh, you know, the move, you look in the mirror and you're like, ah, yeah, it's  making up some distance quickly.  So his lights come on and this is where the fucking shit starts.  Um, his lights come on, boom, get the blinker on.  I'm in the middle lane.  I'm in the right lane.  It's the Long Island fucking expressway. 
[00:15:30]  I know there's an exit ramp coming up to the service road.  So I'm in the right lane.  He's on me with his lights on.  And I'm continuing to go.  I got my right blinker on.  The exit's coming up.  Right before the exit, he's like, pull the right out of this shit.  And it's like, yeah, and all I'm thinking is, hey, dummy, I'm doing this for your fucking  safety, shithead.  I'm not pulling over to the right on the Long Island expressway.  So you got to stick your dumb ass out in the fucking traffic. 
[00:16:00]  Right, because there's no...  So I'm getting you off the road.  It's not like I'm running from you.  At this point, I'm doing 35 miles an hour.  And I'm heading to an off-ramp.  Yeah, there's no shoulder.  So I could get you on the fucking paint where you're not going to get hit.  Right.  Dumb shit.  So he already...  I hope you said that to him.  No, of course I didn't.  Of course I didn't.  I'm a tough guy here.  It's a radio show.  Exactly.  Thank God.  Because you would have to just go through life being frustrated by what happened yesterday.  Thank God.  So, yeah.  So I pull over.  He comes up.  Now, here's where I... 
[00:16:30]  Well, I've been pulled over by the best of them.  I've been pulled over by New York's finest, your NYPDs, your Nassau County Police Department,  your Sheriff's Department guys.  Most of the time, they let you know what you were doing, whatever it is.  They tell you.  And that's that.  This fucking guy...  And here's something that some cops do.  And I got to assume the MTA cops do not get to write many tickets.  So he was probably very excited about this one. 
[00:17:00]  But I don't need the I'm a fucking guy with my learner's permit speech from this guy.  What are you?  You pass me.  You go pass me.  What will you think?  It's like, look.  And again, I didn't say this, but I am on the show.  The thing is, I know your job.  You caught me.  Great.  I was speeding.  You got me.  I understand.  Write your ticket and come back.  I don't need the...  We're two grown men here.  I don't need your fake, I'm angry with you. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you were speeding.  Look, Batman, you're not saving the fucking world out there.  Write your ticket.  I'm not even going to give you shit.  You caught me.  It's the game out there, right?  It's the fucking game.  I'm speeding.  You catch me.  You give me a ticket.  We both laugh and drive away.  Don't give me the...  Why were you...  What were you thinking?  What were you...  What was I thinking?  I was thinking I'd go fast and get home.  Right.  And it was a 71, right?  I was doing 71 in what amounts to a 45. 
[00:18:00]  Now, this is the Long Island Expressway, which is 55 mile an hour speed everywhere else.  71 is easy.  He gets me.  Anyone can do 71.  He gets me.  Yeah, 70, stop it.  71 nowadays is easy.  It's 2012, motherfuckers.  Let's all relax.  I got a nice, big, smooth driving vehicle.  Right.  Again, though, I'm not arguing the point.  It's the law.  You got me.  Sure, sure, sure.  But the reason of a 45 mile an hour speed limit around there...  It's just to give you tickets.  That's why they keep it their way.  Of course it is.  There's nothing that changes on the LIE in that area that makes it where they need to slow down the speed limit. 
[00:18:30]  It's amazing.  No, I wasn't doing 71 out of the tunnel, you dummy fuck.  Are you listening?  Well, because he heard MTA.  I was a good mile, a mile and a half away from the tunnel.  Yeah, you were on your way.  You were back on the LIE.  I was on the expressway proper.  That guy is sick of being passed by guys like you.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it is.  He knows everybody looks at him.  It was a personal insult to him.  Yes.  And that's what it was.  It wasn't the fact that I was speeding or anything.  I personally insulted him when I drove past him because he's not NYPD. 
[00:19:00]  He's not getting the respect on the road.  So he was pissed.  So when he came to the window, he was genuinely mad at me.  Not because I was speeding.  Stop it.  You don't fucking, you're not mad at people because they're going fast.  You're going to change the world as an MTA cop.  Stop.  Brian in San Diego.  Bravo.  He's a cop.  He says it's a lecture or a ticket, not both.  Yeah, well, this guy was giving me both.  Sometimes the cop's like, ah, fuck, you know, I don't have time to give this guy a ticket,  but I'm going to give him a piece of my mind. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  But you don't give the guy both is what he's saying.  That sounds like it's protocol right there.  Exactly.  And now here's the other thing.  Yeah.  He goes, and you didn't use your directional.  And now I'm like, I actually turned to him and went, yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  He goes, no, you didn't.  I said, yes, I did.  I go, first of all, I always use my directional.  It's a force of habit at this point.  And for me to not use it would be uncomfortable.  No matter how I'm weaving in and out of lanes or how fast I'm going or something, 
[00:20:00]  I always, it's second nature to me.  So don't tell me I didn't do it.  He wrote me up for that, too.  Wow.  And by the way.  And you know you did it.  I know I didn't.  And when he was way behind me, where he saw me, he goes, I saw you blow past me and this.  He couldn't see if I was using my directional because there were cars between me and him.  Now, if I'm in the left lane and I want to go around somebody in the left lane and I have to go to the middle lane,  he's not going to see my right directional from where he was. 
[00:20:30]  Can't see it.  His car's in the way.  He wanted to make it hurt.  His word.  He wanted to make it hurt.  He was so insulted.  What?  He was so fucking insulted.  There's a lot of problems there, man.  I didn't realize the MTA had jurisdiction.  I didn't either.  I thought they had to stay close to the tunnels and bridges.  And then secondly, I've been driving in and out of the city as long as you have.  I never knew there was a 45 speed limit there.  I know there's a 50 when you come out of the tunnel. 
[00:21:00]  Well, I didn't know it was 40.  It's 50 miles an hour until the Nassau fucking border.  No.  Yes.  That's stupid.  There is no part of the Long Island Expressway in Queens that is 55 miles an hour.  It's 50 fucking miles an hour the whole way.  Do they do that by, do you think, population?  Like, because it's populated areas?  Probably, but it doesn't matter.  It's not people aren't crossing the expressways.  It's a racetrack.  What do you think?  Yeah.  No, Jimmy.  It's a racetrack.  But I mean, it's how they regulate it. 
[00:21:30]  There's barely any entrance ramps at that point.  Yeah.  It's the same driving there as it is when you're driving through congested areas of Nassau or Suffolk.  It's the same road.  That's there just to give out tickets.  Of course it is.  And make money for the city.  And that just infuriates the fuck out of me.  Now we have to worry about MTA cops?  I didn't even know this.  MTA.  This fucking guy had such a hard on.  He didn't want to hear anything.  He didn't want to see anything.  He was just, I'm going to fucking write you up.  So he comes back.  He goes, he goes, stay in the vehicle. 
[00:22:00]  Did you show me any police cars?  Oh yeah, he didn't want to hear it.  He's MTA.  He doesn't give a shit about NYPD.  He doesn't fucking care.  So he goes, stay in the vehicle.  So he comes back, you know, after the allotted time for writing fucking tickets.  And he just, and still he's pissed.  He's like, I wrote you a ticket for that.  And he's yelling at me for this.  And directional.  And he goes, if you want to, you know, dispute it, not guilty, whatever, fill it out.  And then he just kind of throws it to me and walks away. 
[00:22:30]  Not even like, have a nice day, even sarcastically.  You know how even cops, when they're like, they gave you the business.  They're like, all right, have a good day.  And you're like, thank you.  So I didn't say anything either.  I just fucking looked at him like, you cunt.  What a cunt.  And boy, let me tell you, you know damn well, if you've listened to this program, I backed  the police.  God damn it.  I backed the cops.  And this isn't the fact that he wrote me up.  I understand.  Like I said, it's part of the game.  I've been written up by every fucking department from Montauk to the goddamn New York State. 
[00:23:00]  It's a game and you said it.  You lost.  I lost.  You got me.  It's just the way he did it to you.  But it's him, the yelling, the personal insult that made him give me the directional ticket,  by the way.  That's exactly why he gave me that one.  I used my fucking blinker, shithead.  And that's exactly how you should have said it.  Oh yeah, that would have worked wonders.  There's no way to prove that you did.  Nope, that's just it.  There's no way to go to court and prove, because it's his word against mine. 
[00:23:30]  Now I know me.  I know I've never, I always use my blinker.  Like I said, it's a force of habit.  It's like fucking leaving the toilet and going, did I wipe my ass?  You know you do.  You know you do it.  Right.  So I just know I use my directional every single time.  It's infuriating.  But now I'm going to have to deal with that.  I guess I'll get a mouthpiece and try to get it.  I don't care what I pay as long as I don't get points.  So sometimes you can send a lawyer in lieu of appearing, and they know who to talk to, 
[00:24:00]  and then you fucking...  That was probably, and I'll be honest with you, that's probably the most I've ever even  talked back to a police officer, by saying like, no I didn't.  I've never even argued an officer's ticket that he's given me.  Because I know once they write it, they have to give it to you, so arguing it is ridiculous.  So I've never even argued with a cop and said like, no, I wasn't doing that.  It's like, you got me, I'll deal with it.  Wow.  But this guy, he fucking was bullshitting about the blinker, and that anger thing.  Ugh, stop it. 
[00:24:30]  Some of them are just dicks.  Not angry.  Some of them are just dicks.  You're not angry with me for speeding.  I know you're not.  The funny thing is, when he's in his regular car, he's doing 71 in a 45.  That's what always drives me nuts about some of these guys.  He said that to me.  He goes, you know, even I don't drive past a police officer like that.  I should have said, well, where's a police officer?  He would have been mad.  You think you'd have been mad if you said, look, I didn't mean it, but I equate you guys  to kind of hall monitors to the real cops.  Right, right.  I didn't mean it. 
[00:25:00]  Aren't you kind of just, by the way, your car's old.  They don't even get new cars.  Whoa.  All right, now we've got good calls coming in.  First of all, Jason from CT on Twitter.  Those MTA cops wear full armor and carry MP5s.  Is that true?  I didn't see an MP5 on them.  Probably left it on the hood of the car.  I would think because of terrorism, some of them do, but I don't think an ordinary Joe  that's giving me tickets is carrying a fucking automatic pistol.  White guy?  Yeah, he was a white guy. 
[00:25:30]  Why don't you say that to him?  Point to him.  And he said, why aren't we bonding over this?  Why don't we take care of this right here in Minneapolis?  Oh, shit.  Well, where were you?  Was it Minneapolis?  I thought we could take care of this right here in Queens.  Queens?  Ah, it's my tags.  It's my tags.  I'll take care of this.  What happened?  He forgot to put the tag on?  Of course he did.  He was such an idiot.  He'd do these little fucking mistakes that would blow up into huge things.  Yeah, my fucking tags.  Somebody saying that cop might have seen you go by a million times and finally had it. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  I bet you were the only one.  Big man.  Big fucking king clip on time.  How many cars were on the road?  It was a pretty good day.  Fair enough.  But he didn't get me with a radar or he wasn't stopped waiting for me.  He was driving.  He was just driving from point A to point B.  So how does he know it was 71?  Well, that's another thing.  I don't know.  Do they have their radar tied into the Speedos these days where even if they're driving and  they hit you with a radar, they know how fast you were going? 
[00:26:30]  Maybe.  And how many cars were going as fast as you?  Nah, I'll be honest.  I was passing people.  You were the lead car.  That's what I do.  Nice.  I passed people.  That's my job.  Let's go to Eddie in New York.  Eddie!  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Good.  You're a New York City cop.  I am.  All right.  We're a bit dysfunctional.  We all know this, right?  If we actually go through a toll, let's just pick the Tribal Bridge, and our police department  vehicle, unmarked or marked, easy pass does not work, they will sit there and stare at 
[00:27:00]  you.  I've had my unmarked car, had an easy pass that didn't work or didn't have one in it.  Let's just say, because that was a big issue in time where they finally had to equip us  all with it, and we would sit there and show our identifications, our shields, our handcuffs,  and our placards, and they would literally, they wouldn't let us go through, and I finally,  you know, we were like, we're not going to pay you out of my own pocket, so either let 
[00:27:30]  us go through or I will leave my car here in the middle of the toll.  It's pretty bad.  Are they just assholes, the MTA?  Yeah, they're in their own worlds, and for some reason, they just don't want to give us  the same courtesy.  They seem to love the power they have.  I mean, we've all seen it at the tolls, where all of a sudden one of those guys has to walk  across lanes.  You can see that he's taking his time on purpose, because he's a powerful individual.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Just weird little things you pick up on as far as those guys go.  Well, he wasn't a bridge and tunnel guy, you know? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  No, I understand.  The bridge and tunnel guys, and then there's the MTA guy.  But they're all sort of related, aren't they?  Yeah, but this MTA, like bridge and tunnel, if you're driving down the expressway, I'm  pretty sure they can't fucking pull you over without being within a certain jurisdiction  of a tunnel or bridge.  Unless they saw you, though, and then that can very easily, just like any other, if I  observed you commit a traffic infraction or for some reason have the reason to follow  you further off, then yes, I mean, you know, lights and sirens right after you. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I get that.  Uh, another guy's saying MTA cops, they aren't real cops, they are there to catch toll violations.  No, that's, again, that's the bridge and tunnel guys.  But I guess they gave him a little more power.  Oh, okay, okay.  MTA's got, believe me, they got the jurisdiction.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they're not.  I googled it.  I'm sure you did your research.  But my question is simple.  Don't they have other things to worry about, like an MTA cop?  I don't know.  It's hard to pull over a train.  Does it, huh?  Yeah, but the front pin. 
[00:29:00]  Choo-choo.  Front page of the paper, Al-Qaeda is ready to hit New York again.  Well, if Al-Qaeda's speeding on the expressway, they'll pull him over.  But wouldn't that be something that an MTA cop should be more concerned about?  I would assume.  Than you speeding?  Big threats on the trains and, you know, mass transit, things like that.  Sure.  I think maybe he should be patrolling around looking for buses doing silly things.  I would assume that they should assume that there's plenty of cops out there to catch speeders. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They don't really need to go into that area.  He was personally insulted that I passed him.  Sure.  That's what it is.  And I know it.  I know he was insulted.  I did not respect his car and him driving, being the pace car, because I assume when  he drives down the highway, nobody passes him.  And he probably likes that power.  Oh, yeah.  I wouldn't doubt it.  So, you know, that's it.  That's it.  Yeah, this guy wants to talk to you.  Mike in Philly.  Mike. 
[00:30:00]  Mike!  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, I got the same kind of friends you got.  You know, you got to use your inside back channel connections, get through this guy,  and you have to show up.  But, you know, I had the same guy.  Same type of guy.  I drove down the sidewalk at a club I used to DJ at.  Yeah, I've done that.  And this guy rolls up, he goes, you're an asshole.  So, what do you think you're something special?  I said, excuse me, are you driving me on my sidewalk? 
[00:30:30]  I said, well, I'm sorry, but I have to pick some equipment up.  He said, well, I'll write you a fucking ticket, asshole.  Dude, I said, you see the name on the front of this club?  At the time, it was a little political thing we had.  I said, you know where that ticket's going to go, cuz.  He said, yeah, I know, so fuck you.  But again, you know, I said, you know where I have the ticket?  It's, uh, put the ticket on my windshield, and when I get done loading, I'll handle the ticket downtown with my people from here. 
[00:31:00]  If you don't want to show me respect, I ain't going to show you enough respect.  Well, you're a cop, too?  No.  But I know people.  I know people.  It's, you know what it is.  I pay your salary.  I pay your salary, sir.  It's that fake anger that gets me.  That's what it is.  It's the fake, like, you come to the window, and you're legitimately mad and yelling.  And if you're not, and that's like an act, we're adults here.  Save it for the kid with the permit, all right?  I understand, like I said, I understand the game. 
[00:31:30]  You got me.  I fucking was speeding.  You caught me.  Let's just leave it at that.  I don't need the daddy speech about how, you know, I'm fucking, you know, you know what could happen if...  Shut up!  No, you don't care.  And, how importantly, if that's the permit, how did you handle your, uh, friend on your, uh, right hip?  I assume that you're right-handed.  It's not a, uh, you don't have to, uh, mention anything to any police officers.  If it's the summer, if it's the summer, and, and you're very, you're wearing very light clothing, 
[00:32:00]  and I think that maybe when I go for my wallet or I lean over or something that it might show,  then I'll inform the officer.  I'll hand him the permit first.  I'll let him know what's going on.  Uh, and usually, that usually gets, that usually diffuses the situation,  because he kind of sometimes wants to talk about guns or, you know, shit like that.  Well, what I would do, the way I would show it, is I would just pull it out,  and I would fucking put it right in the, uh, dashboard.  And I would say, that's mine.  Don't fucking touch it.  I got the paperwork at home.  Now let's talk. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, my paperwork's at home.  That's not the way to do it.  Your turn.  This is my move.  What's your move?  And, and, and, and, uh, in this, on the, in the same, uh, uh, vein here,  I want to say hello and a very fine how do you do  to the wonderful, uh, Nassau County Police Department pistol licensing, uh, department in Mineola.  Are you good?  Because those guys were great.  Uh, they made a, uh, a normally shitty, uh, situation that you have to go through to get,  uh, renew your pistol license.  Um, not easier. 
[00:33:00]  They didn't do anything special, but I had all the paperwork.  I had gotten everything, uh, gave it to them, and very quickly and efficiently.  Well, because you said you were going to go down there and throw your weight around.  Did you, did you?  Ah, you're an asshole.  You said, because Ann had said, like, they know who I am.  I go down there and I throw my paperwork.  Throw my weight around.  What was the expression?  You don't even have to speak.  You just, you clap.  I clap.  And they jump to it.  They jump.  Atta boy.  Way to handle it.  That's funny.  Uh, no, they're great, uh, great guys down there. 
[00:33:30]  I, like, I see them down at the, uh, the P6, uh, range every so often.  So it's kind of nice to know them guys.  Very good.  Well, uh.  MTA, not my buddies right now.  Or at least that guy.  Ah, they're in their own world, I think.  Yeah, I think, uh, that's why I knew, I knew this guy probably never gets to write tickets.  And there was no way I was talking him out of him getting his big writing a ticket thing, you know?  It was a big deal for him.  MTA, this guy's fucking, he's probably constantly fucking, like, with buses and shit. 
[00:34:00]  You know, oh, let me make sure this is, he has an inspection.  You know, just shit like that.  Getting a rowdy guy in an Escalade like me, zipping down the expressway.  Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.  71.  And he didn't know I could have been a gangster.  Which should be in a 55, technically.  That 45, uh, that's just bullshit.  So, again, I'll pay whatever they need.  Um, I just don't want points on my license.  I got me one of them none-point license, and I want to keep it that way. 
[00:34:30]  Today's, uh, viral video is this fucking, uh, tow truck plummeting.  Oh, that's a good one, yeah.  The news is playing that one.  You'll obviously see this a hundred times.  That guy's amazing.  It's, it's worth watching at least 50 times before it gets a little boring.  Yeah.  I haven't seen it.  It's a, what is it, a big fucking 18-wheeler or something?  Yep.  He's got a big tractor trailer, and he's got a tow truck, and he's trying to pull it, uh,  from the shoulder of this icy, snowy road and get it back onto the road.  Uh, but I guess this thing just teetered over, slid off the side of the cliff, a huge mountain, 
[00:35:00]  and took the tow truck with it.  And as the tow truck is being pulled, uh, off the side of the road, the door opens, and the  guy fucking jumps out of the tow truck.  That was some James Bond shit.  This guy is lucky.  He's trying to pull.  There goes the tow truck, and he jumps right out.  Now the tow truck's about to go over the edge, and he jumps out at the last second.  Holy shit!  He'd have been dead!  And then someone runs to the, uh, the side of this cliff or, or mountain, and there you 
[00:35:30]  go.  You get to see the two vehicles just rolling down.  Yep.  The guy should have been in the fucking tow truck.  That was pretty fast.  That happened quickly.  Yeah.  No kidding, man.  I wonder if he felt it right before, like, it unbuckled his belt, like, this could be a problem.  I bet he knew when he got in and hooked it up, he probably went, if this truck goes over  the edge, I'm jumping out of this.  Like, he knew before anything happened that this was a possibility.  Fuck.  Unbelievable.  Being a tow truck driver on a fucking icy cliff road like that?  Who drives on that road?  Imagine being the passenger?  Oh, jeez. 
[00:36:00]  Cup of coffee?  All relaxed.  That would be, you know what, Dylan, relax.  I got my eye.  Look at the app.  Dude, look at my app.  Check out this app.  You bring up a good point.  I jailbroke it.  Because every time we've been towed, you sit in the passenger seat.  Yeah.  Because where else are you going to go?  He might have even told the guy, look, stand aside until I pull this off the shoulder onto  the road, and then, you know.  So the truck driver wasn't in the passenger seat?  I'm guessing that's where he was filming it.  Maybe.  Maybe he was filming it.  Okay.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Can you see that again?  Because that's a good...  I didn't realize he was just pulling it away. 
[00:36:30]  This is our visual element to the show.  Go to our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony Erock is going to put it up there immediately for us, even though you'll see  this everywhere today.  Okay.  Wow.  And it just pulls the tow truck with it over the side.  And the guy you see gets out just in time.  It's just carnage after that.  The two trucks just rolling down a hill.  By the way, perfect viral video.  It is.  Got all the action.  You don't have the...  Oh, shit!  Yeah.  No shaky cam.  No one in the middle of the action turning the camera to their face.  Oh, motherfucker! 
[00:37:00]  You've seen it!  YouTube!  YouTube!  It's going viral, yo!  And then back to the action.  Dummy.  Jesus.  And he didn't get hit with the door jumping out.  That was a good jump.  I know.  He lucked out.  But imagine being...  Yo, world star hip-hop!  Yo, world star hip-hop!  We hear Denny's...  Yeah, this shit going down!  Here we come!  World star hip-hop!  Just fucking shoot the action, please.  By the way, great. 
[00:37:30]  Brian Cashman had a stalker.  The Yankee GM.  Oh, yeah, he did.  And this fucking bitch is in so much trouble.  Like, they are throwing the book out.  Like, he got her put through the system.  Yeah.  It's like...  First, you know these people that just won't stop?  And men are much more dangerous than women when they do it,  because men will kill you,  whereas women are just fucking irritating, clingy fucks.  Right.  But I love the fact that he's fucking...  She's being ruined by this.  Dragged through the system.  Well, I would imagine...  I would imagine Brian Cashman has some connections, too, 
[00:38:00]  to help him along a little bit.  That's the point.  Jamming the Yankees in New York.  It's like, you stupid...  Could you have picked a better guy to stalk?  But that shit will trickle...  That shit will trickle down until the women,  thinking they, you know, want to do something like this.  So we'll help everybody in the end.  Hi, Brian.  I just want to say,  you don't deserve a girl like me.  Brian, I'm the best.  I'm the best you would have ever had.  And you threw it away, so whatever. 
[00:38:30]  I don't want to see you or hear from you anymore.  Aside from the 20 more times I'll call today.  Brian?  Brian?  Yeah, Brian.  Oh, this fucking bitch is so nailed.  They're just using every bit of fucking police power to get her.  I mean, because, you know, again, she fucked up his marriage and everything, so...  She was blackmailing him, right?  I don't know exactly...  Like, there's...  I think she's charged with extortion.  I just...  I know that she's just a clingy, no-hint-taking psycho. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  And I'm so glad she's fucking suffering.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Fucking asshole.  Back to the viral video.  Someone is writing on Twitter that the driver was in the truck, a few broken bones.  Is that true, Sam?  No way.  Is it part of the story?  I think.  Well, I'm trying to figure out, where would the truck driver be?  You're saying, yeah.  A Lithuanian truck driver is in stable condition with multiple broken bones after his vehicle  fell 196 feet down a snowy cliff, dragging a tow truck with it. 
[00:39:30]  How scared he must have been?  So the driver stayed in his truck?  The driver was in the truck, so the tow truck driver jumped out, but there was a driver in  that truck that fell down first.  He probably didn't have time to react.  Oh.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Oh, Gene Simmons.  I'm opening up Rock and Brew's Restaurant.  What?  What is that?  Gene Simmons is opening up a restaurant.  Gene Simmons is opening up a restaurant.  Where?  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Oh.  Rock and Brew's.  I had to watch the Country Music Awards.  Oh, God.  There he is.  Question for Jimmy?  Sure.  So Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley go up there. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, sorry.  To give out an award, whatever.  They looked very out of place.  But then you didn't have the Ace Frehley and the Peter Criss.  You had two guys looking really just stupid up there, because it was obvious they  Tommy Thayer, I think, is a guitarist, and I believe it's Eric Singer is the drummer.  And both those guys have worn the makeup in the past.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, but they looked really out of place.  Like, they are obviously barely part of the band.  I would prefer that they had different kind of characters. 
[00:40:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, I would prefer that, just because I don't need to have it look like it looked  in 1976, so it's a different band now.  Right.  Like, you know what I mean?  It's like, look, Ace and Peter left.  What do you even do?  They're gone.  Right.  So you got two other guys.  I would prefer to just have them, because I don't need to look at it and go, wow,  it's the visual.  Because that's what Gene's point is.  Like, hey, look, Ben, this is the way that people like to see the band.  It's what they like to watch.  I would prefer to see them in different characters.  That's all.  Can he fix his hair?  It's black cotton candy. 
[00:41:00]  Gene Simmons' hair has, it just has drove me nuts for years.  What is it?  It looks dead.  It looks dead?  He has dead hair on his head?  Yes, dead hair on my head.  It's a new restaurant.  I've secretly trademarked the word hamburger, so I'll be suing anybody that uses the word  hamburger like they do in my restaurant.  Really?  I eagerly look forward to going to Gene's restaurant and having a burger.  Having a kiss, some kiss fries.  Get up a fucking, yeah.  Thank you, Gene.  Could I have the pompous pork rib? 
[00:41:30]  And could I have the ridiculous ribs?  No.  Could I have the shithead shake?  And, uh, Gene.  No, I'd say, let me have the Starchild special, please, with a side of Demon's fries.  Oh, God.  That's what I wouldn't have.  Oh, really?  Hamburger shaped like a star.  I'm going to enjoy my kiss burgers.  A Starchild.  Yay!  Oh, God.  And if you could eat the hot dog in one piece like Paul does, just put it down your throat,  you get it free. 
[00:42:00]  I will not stand for this talk of my childhood heroes.  I know, Jimmy.  Oh.  Paul Staley had a jelly belly during the Country Music Awards.  Did he?  It's like star wearing a one piece.  He has his costume where the belly shows, I guess, back in the 70s.  He might have been in shape to pull that off.  Now it's just a jelly belly.  Let me see the Country Music.  An extremely hairy jelly belly.  Yeah, he is kind of a bear.  Yes, we have the Gene, the Simmons hair pasta, which is, we don't even boil it. 
[00:42:30]  It's just ramen noodles without any water.  Very dry.  See?  Get it?  I will not support any mockery of the Gene Simmons restaurant.  My childhood heroes, I will go and have myself a nice kiss shake.  It's four delicious ice creams.  One for each member of the band.  Oh, great.  I'll have the, you're going to try to fuck my girlfriend chicken?  Jesus Christ.  Fuck this guy. 
[00:43:00]  Sounds like Jimmy might be doing something with Kiss or Gene Simmons in the near future.  No, no, not at all.  I just think that that's being very selfish, and it's like any girl I've ever dated, it's  the rule.  Well, if anybody in the original four lineup of Kiss wants to fuck you, give it up.  If Ozzy wants to fuck you, he's also allowed to kill you after.  Those are my rules for chicks.  Remember how he made fun of everyone that got married or is in a long-term relationship,  and then this dummy turns around and gets married?  Stop.  Shut up.  Oh, that's funny. 
[00:43:30]  Kevin, we're going to get the stop your typing steak.  He told Danny to stop.  He doesn't like being interrupted.  Stop his typing.  As he shouldn't.  Can I have the, I'm going to shush you fries?  Yeah.  Oh, enough of you.  That's right.  That's what you need.  Gene Simmons shushing you.  That's right.  It's a rock and brew restaurant designed to capture excitement of concerts.  It's going to be all the excitement of a concert.  Trying to fucking eat in peace.  You're talking to somebody and a giant Kiss fucking million watts of lights light up over 
[00:44:00]  your table.  Sure.  You eat your chicken pot pie, you cut into it, and there's a little radio in it, and they  go, I want to rock and roll out of your pot pie.  That sounds dangerous.  I would enjoy that quite a bit, actually.  I don't know anything about this restaurant, but I would assume it's going to be hot waitresses  and maybe Kiss makeup.  Dressed in Kiss makeup?  There would have to be.  It's actually a good idea.  It would have to be some kind of a Kiss theme to work.  It can't just be a regular restaurant that he's financing. 
[00:44:30]  Where is it opening?  I need to know where this will be.  Kiss and Motley Crue this summer, though.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a good tour.  I would love to meet the original four Kiss together, man.  And it is a disgrace they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I mean, it's just wrong.  We had three out of the four, right?  I don't think Peter Criss was there that famous day at N.A.W.  Let's see.  Rock and Brew.  El Segundo?  I met them with Peter, but with Tommy.  El Segundo!  He's been with them a while, Tommy.  We've never met Peter Criss, I don't think.  I've met him a couple times.  I'd love to interview him, especially after the breast cancer. 
[00:45:00]  Because you look at Ace.  Ace is a fucking cool dude, man.  I mean, they're just not business guys.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I guess.  Is it El Segundo, California?  Yeah.  Where's that?  I don't know, but, um...  It's the El Segundo.  Fred Sammer used to talk about it all the time.  Going to El Segundo.  How do you remember that?  I don't know.  I just remember that.  Where is it in relation to L.A.?  Oh, another one is set to open in the Los Angeles International Airport later this year. 
[00:45:30]  Well, you could go to that one, Jimmy.  Yeah, I got some stuff in L.A., so I'll go.  Bing, boom.  Simmons.  We got our first flying car.  Makes debut at New York Auto Show.  I hate that, though, because it's a plane.  Flying cars should be a car that flies.  That's a driving plane.  It's not a flying car.  It's a driving plane.  I guess you're right.  I don't want a vehicle that, if it gets clipped in a fender bender, you can't fly it.  You know, if somebody hits that wing as you're driving it as a car, 
[00:46:00]  you can't then open it up and fly it.  They should make a rule that the wings don't fold in if you have a flying car.  So you've got to drive it down the highway with fucking a wingspan.  You've got to figure out if people are going to allow you to take up two lanes for your flying car.  Can I get in here?  Can I get in here?  Are you going to need all three lanes?  Trying to edge your wing in in front of a truck.  A little help here, please.  Yeah, I don't buy that.  Should we break and eat?  Yeah, let's eat, motherfucker.  I want to have my destroyer eggs. 
[00:46:30]  Destroyer eggs?  Yeah, I'm going to have my destroyer eggs.  Oh, good.  That's fantastic.  Have a nice kiss burger.  Some bacon.  I'm sure they'll be called things like that.  It's probably shaped like tongues, the bacon.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I bet.  Hanging out like it's fucking rocking in front of you.  Oh, douchey.  No.  Oh, Gene.  It's going to be good.  Gene's great.  He's a douche.  He's great, isn't he?  He's wonderful.  Fuck yeah, man.  Yeah, Detroit Rock City burgers.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  That'll be $70 for a burger.  He's great.  I need to make money, too.  Love him.  He's great.  What a guy.  All right, let's eat, man.  I'm hungry.  Kiss.  Kiss.  Kiss.  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  We're back.  Back in the New York groove.  Welcome back to the OBN Anthony Show.  Serious XM. 
[00:47:30]  The OBN Anthony Show.  Are we getting topical, you think?  I can't imagine any other reason he'd play this. 
[00:48:00]  Turn it up a little bit, I guess.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, sexy.  Such a dick move.  You enjoy it, though.  I see you laughing.  It was funny.  I don't allow the song to establish itself.  Oh, you dropped a bomb on me.  Oh, let's see.  All right.  We bombed something, then. 
[00:48:30]  What happened?  What happened?  I think we bombed something, then.  Yeah, that has to be.  Very obvious.  Maybe it's just a good song.  Is this a good song?  No.  You rock.  Maybe it's just a good song.  Who sang this?  Gap Band.  Right.  Right.  The Gap Band.  Unabomber?  Yeah.  Did he bomb something?  Nah, they caught him 16 years ago today. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, really?  Really?  Now, that kind of seems like that's about when that happened.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes you hear this shit, and you're like, what?  That long ago?  This one, that seems about right.  Who the, what the?  That one's all right.  We can handle that one.  What the, who?  That's the music shit I can't handle.  Yeah.  Because that seems like yesterday.  I was telling you about a stock yesterday.  I still have it.  Yeah.  That you sold a while ago. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Um, and I was doing the math.  I'm like, holy fuck.  We got that stock, like, like, it was 15 years ago.  A long time ago.  So, I held on to a stock for 15 years.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  That's going long with it.  You think?  Yeah.  That's long?  Yeah.  15 years is going long.  Damn.  What else is going on, E-Rog?  Anything else to mention in the whole birthday anniversary, things that happened on this date?  No, I wanted to do Jesse James was shot to death by Robert Ford 130 years ago, but I 
[00:50:00]  really wasn't finding much other than Woody Guthrie.  Oh.  Jesse James.  I thought Jesse James, I was going to get, I was frightened.  The motorcycle guy.  The motorcycle guy, who, by the way, was pulled over yesterday and didn't get a ticket.  Oh, really?  Picture him with the guy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm like, well, it didn't work for me.  Yeah, we got to get a little more famous.  You know, right?  Who am I kidding?  We're less famous by the day. 
[00:50:30]  Less famous by the day.  Oh, I mean, duh.  Jesse James was shot.  What do you know about this, Ant?  Who is this Robert Ford cat?  Oh, he was the coward.  The cowardly guy that wanted to be part of the gang.  Right.  Want to be part of the fucking crew, yo's.  And he shot Jesse James in the back as Jesse James was straightening out a picture on the wall.  Oh, fuck.  Yep.  Yep.  What a prick.  That's too bad. 
[00:51:00]  What a faggot.  What a puss-a.  Ah, puss-a.  Ah, puss-a.  I know.  Um, Kenny's freaking me out.  Why?  What's he doing?  We, uh, we finally found, um, Kenny's kryptonite.  What, a smile?  Intelligence.  Smile.  Oh, well, okay.  Here goes the bit.  A chin.  Uh, fashionable clothing.  Yeah, exactly.  Unable to wear a normal color.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Kenny.  Dry hair.  Look at his eye.  I know he is.  Oh, man. 
[00:51:30]  What happened?  You look like one of those kittens on those ASPCA commercials.  Yeah.  A big one, though.  Yeah.  I wanted somebody to pop my eye out and skull fuck me, but nobody would accommodate me.  No, he popped it out.  No.  Kenny suffers from, um, seasonal allergies.  What?  Seasonal allergies.  Seasonal allergies.  And that.  Oh.  Did you enjoy your, uh, your day yesterday?  When?  It was, uh, it was autism awareness day yesterday.  I wasn't aware of that. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, they realized.  Maybe they shouldn't call it awareness then.  That's funny how you think about it.  Yeah, true.  I mean, let's all acknowledge and do what we can, sure.  I mean, it's, it's an epidemic in this country in the last 20 years, but to call it awareness,  I don't know.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Uh, Kenny.  Yes, sir.  Seasonal allergies, they get you bad, right?  Yes, G.H., I'm allergic to everything green. 
[00:52:30]  And you have to get shots all...  You're allergic to envy?  Oh, boy.  I knew that was coming.  You have to get shots all year long, right?  You're one of those guys?  Yes, I do.  Wow, really?  Allergy shots, just to try to keep it all down.  So you eat your broccoli?  No, I don't eat anything green.  No, huh?  You're not allergic to that stuff.  You just don't like it.  He's lying.  He's not allergic to green stuff.  He's fibbing.  He just doesn't like it?  Yeah.  He's like a fucking little kid who doesn't want to eat his vegetables on the road.  So he says I'm allergic to it.  As far as the food thing goes, he's an older version of Sam. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  Kenny doesn't eat a lot of shit either.  He's gotten better, though.  Yeah?  With salads and stuff on the road, he'll eat his salads.  I think he knows he has to, because when he shits, little fucking building blocks come out.  It's good for my digestive tract.  Did Jim Morton tell you that?  Who?  No.  But I've been beating him up to fucking eat vegetables.  Jim eats very healthy.  I eat a lot.  I eat green every day.  Greens.  Yeah, but then he blows it with the dessert thing.  Not so much lately, because of the Weight Watchers.  You blew it! 
[00:53:30]  I've never seen anyone eat so well, and then the dessert tray comes, and he ruins it every time.  I've been really good lately, though, with the Weight Watchers desserts.  There are only two, three perints.  Some of them are four perints.  Nice.  April 29th, they'll have another dessert.  I thought it was 28th.  Oh.  We're going up to 28th.  Oh, we're broadcasting 28th.  No, I'm shooting the 28th, so late that night.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  I'll probably have a nice dessert.  Yeah, you've got to treat yourself.  I love when you go out to dinner with Jimmy, and he's eating healthy stuff.  I love when you go out to dinner with Jimmy.  Yes, that's true.  Grilled chicken, grilled asparagus, Caesar salad. 
[00:54:00]  When the dessert car thing comes by, and you just hear Jimmy go, ooh!  His meal's like maybe 400 calories, and his dessert's 2,020.  Yeah.  I want to go to that place on, have you been to that place that Patrice used to love?  The vegan place.  The vegan place.  No, no, no.  The vegan.  Vegan, yes.  Plataforma?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, Plataforma's great.  It's amazing.  Love that place.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is it good?  Slice that meat off.  Meat.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Love meat. 
[00:54:30]  Give me that, give me that, give me that, give me two of those, give me two of those,  give me one of those, give me one of those, give me two of those.  Would you like?  Yes!  And plenty of it.  Keep it coming.  That's the paddle place?  We were just talking about the paddle place.  I think planes should have, oh, I invented something I don't want to tell anybody about.  Oh.  Then why would you bring it up on a show like this?  It's for the plane, it helps it fly smoother.  Oh, God.  You have anything in aeronautics?  Giant fold-out roads.  No.  That roll out in front of the plane and it just drives really fast and they, it just  drives really fast and they roll back up behind it. 
[00:55:00]  You know how much money that would cost?  Yes, I do.  Approximately four billion a mile.  I've worked it out.  I don't think that works very well.  I want to see it in cartoon form first.  It's more of a Ted dimension.  So, back to Kenny, he's got a left eye that is fucked up.  It's bright red.  Yeah.  And I get the same shit as Kenny, so we kind of talk about this shit on the way in.  And my allergist gives me this tiny, tiny little fucking eyedrop thing. 
[00:55:30]  It's like $200 for like 20 eyedrops.  You can only use like one a day or something like that.  But Kenny, this is the weird part of the whole story.  Kenny can't put eyedrops in himself.  What?  What a man.  What are you doing?  He can't.  He needs someone to do it for him.  No, you don't.  How come you can't?  My eyes are very delicate.  But you can't just like open up your eye like we all do and just go lean your head back  and just plop an eyedrop in there. 
[00:56:00]  No, if I do it, I do it with my eye closed and just try to shoot it through the slit.  What's wrong with you?  He's raping his own eye.  Why would you do that?  What's wrong with you?  Where does this come from?  That's why I can never have LASIK surgery because you're awake and see that knife coming to your eyeball.  You don't see a knife.  I don't know.  You don't see anything.  No, I would get LASIK again in a second.  Where do I go? 
[00:56:30]  I kind of want it.  My left eye needs, which was always weaker.  Yeah, I can't drive as well.  I need my glasses now to drive.  I hate that.  So does somebody else who refuses.  He's the fucking worst.  It's like, can he put your glasses on?  I don't need them.  Well, you're slowing down for the exit.  It says three quarters of a mile and you're hitting the brakes.  Drive carefully.  You weren't driving carefully yesterday if we're going to bring it up.  I had to wake him up because it was time to fucking go through the green light.  I'm like, how do you fall asleep? 
[00:57:00]  You picked me up five minutes ago.  Oh, man.  That's his apnea.  All of a sudden, I'm like, oh, my God.  Has he been driving the whole time this tired?  All of a sudden, we're third in line and I'm looking down at my phone, tweeting or some dumb shit.  I look up.  It's a green light and the cars that were in front of us are long gone.  I just assumed we were still at a red.  I look over and this idiot is sleeping and heavily.  And I had to wake him up.  Sleeping right there at the wheel.  Heavily.  I'm like, Kenny, it's our turn to go. 
[00:57:30]  There's not many cars at that hour.  But it goes back to Jim Norton's shows at Caroline's.  Kenny drives in from Jersey to help Jimmy out and all that.  And then I go, Kenny, I got a guest room.  I got a couch.  Just crash.  I don't give a fuck.  Why are you driving all the way home just to come back in a couple hours?  So he's very tired.  I'm on it.  He's very tired.  He doesn't like people to do nice things for him.  It's weird.  Now he doesn't even acknowledge that I offer.  I write him text messages and stuff.  He doesn't even acknowledge that I extended the offer. 
[00:58:00]  He doesn't like to have people.  He doesn't know how to accept because he rightfully thinks that he doesn't deserve them.  No, that's true.  You're right about that.  Oh, is that it?  He doesn't think he deserves them?  Of course it is.  He doesn't want to be a good person.  What do you always say to us?  I'm just a help.  No, don't worry about me.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't worry about me.  He's been doing that for many years.  So you want us to put eye drops in your eye?  I mean, we can give you some relief.  Troy already did. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, it doesn't look as red right now.  You put one drop of sustain in.  Why the fuck wouldn't you do that on the air?  A giant like you that needs someone to put eye drops in his head.  That's true.  Open your eyes.  That's a radio bit right there.  So Troy is here with his new nose?  Yeah.  You want to take a look?  Yeah.  You got to see the new schnozzola.  You don't even recognize him.  Really?  He's so handsome.  He's even more handsome now, right?  He's so handsome.  I find that fucking good.  Even more handsome.  More handsome.  How can that be?  Here he comes running down the hall. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, God.  Great.  Hope his new nose falls off.  We missed Troy Kwan around these pots.  Thanks, Kenny.  I didn't know you got the eye drop.  We were going to try to take care of it.  Oh, man.  Look at this fucking handsome guy.  Who are you?  Who hired the model?  Wow, wait.  Well, I got my nose fixed.  I'm Troy Kwan.  I'm lightheaded from running down the hallway.  Oh, well.  You sound stuffy.  That's really, you should blow your nose. 
[00:59:30]  I can't.  I'm afraid my brain is going to fall out.  Are you still swollen, or are we looking at your new nose?  And now I'm confused.  I'm really swollen.  Still, right?  He's still swollen.  They say it swells for about six months.  Whoa!  Really?  Crazy.  So why would you do that?  That means...  Well, six months from now, he's going to be fucking knocking him down.  It's going to look gorgeous.  Knocking him down left and right.  Well, as I said to you guys before, I got it not for cosmetic reasons.  Of course.  Of course.  We believe you.  We never thought that.  No, I had it because...  I had it because I couldn't breathe. 
[01:00:00]  You couldn't breathe.  Right.  Because you looked in the mirror, and you're like, I could be so much more handsome, and  you lost your breath.  With a panic attack.  Yeah.  So you couldn't breathe because of that, right?  No, I just couldn't sleep.  Oh.  So...  You couldn't sleep.  You were just thinking about how much more handsome you should be.  I know.  That would be like racking my brain.  I understand what you're saying, right?  Is your nose blocked with, like, gauze, or no?  It's just swollen.  Everything's just swollen, and...  Did you have a bump or something?  I had a bump in my nose, and my nose was crooked. 
[01:00:30]  It was off to the side.  Yeah, but that's not why you did it.  It was to breathe.  Well, I mean, obviously, if you're going to go through the pain...  Yeah, I got you.  Right?  Right.  I mean, if you're going to go through it, why wouldn't you get it to look as good as  you can?  Exactly.  You sound a little nasally.  Exactly.  Why would you fix your deviated septum, and then just be like, oh, fuck it, just keep  it crooked?  How about your turbinos today?  Can I shrink them?  What's that?  I didn't have a problem with those.  That's why when you have a water pump go in your car, you get it all repainted and  fucking all detailed.  I mean, that makes sense, right?  I mean, why would I...  Yeah, sure.  Why would you fix a deviated septum and not straighten it out while you're there? 
[01:01:00]  Fix that shit up.  Yeah.  Why would you want to have a...  Would you want a crooked nose?  No, I understand you perfectly.  That's a bit combative today.  What's this one?  I know.  Well, when you're so good looking...  You ever hear from girls that say, like, oh, he was so good looking, but geez, he's  entering that realm of just the hot guy that just, you know, hey.  How much gauze does that stuff up that nose?  That was packed.  And then they pull it out, and it feels like it comes from inside your brain when they pull  it out.  Does that hurt? 
[01:01:30]  Oh, it's awful.  It's fucking...  It's a brutal surgery.  I never had the gauze, dude.  My guy...  I'll even...  I had a great surgeon, and I was done in, like, a week.  Mangala?  Yeah.  Yes.  That would have been good.  You had your septum done?  Oh, yeah.  I had a deviant septum.  He had a deviant septum.  Yeah.  It only works in his fucking young panties.  But they go in, and he has this gel I think he invented where he lines your nose with a gel  so you don't have to be stuffed.  It wasn't gel.  It's always a cum joke. 
[01:02:00]  And you have to sit up, though.  I slept sitting up for a week.  Yeah.  It was hard.  Yeah, man.  It's brutal.  It really is.  And my nose just keeps leaking.  Well, try it.  You know, a lot of people use that whole thing.  You know, it's an excuse to get a nose job.  You hear it all the time.  Yeah.  I didn't really need a nose job, but...  Well, let's see an old picture of you.  We'll decide.  We'll decide if you need a nose job or not.  I love the Troi Kwan gallery, though, on the Facebook page.  Thank you for that, by the way.  You did have a little bump.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  No more bump for Troi Kwan. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, man.  I mean, it's swollen now.  I have a fucking massive honker, but...  Are you sleeping on your back or your side?  Yeah, sleeping sitting up.  Oh, you have to.  Yeah.  It's hard.  Yeah, it was rough, man.  It was...  A rocky Dennis Knight's sleep.  That sucks.  I literally...  I slept for about a week.  Like, that's how fucked up you get, man.  It really...  And the surgery's a brutal thing, man.  I mean, they...  They give you Vicodin?  How do you know it's brutal?  You're out cold.  Well, when you wake up, you're just...  It just feels like you got blasted in the face with a sledgehammer.  And it's weird, too, because, you know, I'm sitting there waiting to go in, and they 
[01:03:00]  made me walk into the surgery table.  So...  What shitty insurance you have?  They'll give you a table, you're going to stand up and do the surgery.  It's just a weird thing.  And, like, I walk in...  It's got a lot of heart surgery.  Do you want anesthesia?  You want it, right?  Yeah, the whole gurney thing into the room.  Yeah, I'll blow off the gurney.  What else could I blow off?  Save some money there.  I'll go into the operating room naked.  I'll save a little money there.  Yeah, well, they...  They said, all right, well, you know, come on, you're ready to go. 
[01:03:30]  So I walk in, and, like, these guys are, you know, in their, you know, scrubs and whatnot,  and they're like, hey, what's up, man?  I'm just looking.  I'm like, dude, shut the fuck up, man.  I'm not ready for bro-ing down with you.  And then they have, like, music blasting in the surgery room.  And they're, like, laughing and hanging out and partying.  And I'm like...  What song was it?  You remember?  I don't remember.  But I had a panic attack.  But they probably know that you're, like, a handsome model rock guy that wanted to make  you feel like at home.  And I just...  I had a major panic attack and started freaking out.  And they just... 
[01:04:00]  You think they took me...  Wow.  Yeah, go ahead.  And then they strap you down, you know, when you're doing the surgery.  You think they touched your penis?  I very well could have, because I had no idea what was going on.  Who could blame them?  Yeah, you gotta be...  You gotta be very trusting.  Yeah.  To let someone put you under.  Yeah, but my doctor was good.  You know what I remember?  I remember laying there.  They wheeled me in.  And my doctor, I saw...  We said, hello, how are you?  It was freezing in the operating room.  Freezing.  Why is it so cold?  I have no idea.  I'm guessing for germ reasons or maybe for the equipment being heated.  I don't know. 
[01:04:30]  Letterman was a surgeon.  Yeah, yeah.  It was fucking cold.  It's probably better to keep you cold, I would assume, than hot.  Yeah.  And he was fucking humming.  He was like...  And he's telling me that you're going to get...  Count back, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, what an asshole.  Next thing I remember, I'm fucking in recover.  Yeah.  That's weird.  It's time travel.  Time...  Yeah.  And then supposedly the anesthesia has this effect where it can reverse what you remember,  but I didn't.  I remembered everything up to the point of laying down on the table.  And it's fucking... 
[01:05:00]  It's crazy, dude.  It's...  I'm with a sore ass.  That old gag.  That would be...  That would suck to be raped during surgery.  Oh, you're not kidding.  I mean...  So...  Yeah, I'm all right.  I'm very weak.  I...  Hey, you don't look good.  Yeah, I don't feel good.  You really don't look good.  I really...  Did he come back too soon?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, they can only give you five days off, and then you have to fill out all this  paperwork to take more days off.  So...  What?  At Sirius?  Yeah.  Fucking fill it out.  Yeah.  Fill it up.  I'm pretty...  You do realize that there's no one here ever. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  And they're giving you a problem.  Yeah.  Especially these days.  And I get back, and my studio's all fucked up.  It's tore apart.  Nobody told me anything.  So I haven't had a chance to do anything yet today.  What happened?  I don't...  Nobody knows.  No one ever knows.  So he was just torn apart, so...  Well, Sal was doing the boneyard with me, and he was in there causing a ruckus.  Yeah.  Ruckus.  Kicking shit.  He's a ruckus at this point.  Yeah.  But I'm back, and I'm going to sweat it out today.  Better than ever?  Not better than ever, but I'm...  Oh, you will be.  I'm hanging in there.  And you already put eye drops in Kenny's eyes? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  He looks like shit.  His eyes are completely...  I was like, dude, you need Visine.  I just had, like, an eye lubricant.  He needs to get Visine.  He's in pretty bad shape.  So we could still put eye drops in his eye?  I mean, it's not going to do anything.  It's just going to lubricate it.  It'll just look hilarious, because he's a monster, and he can't put eye drops in his  own eye.  Yeah, and I had to hold his eye open.  So weird.  He wouldn't even keep it open.  Could we do this?  Does anyone have eye drops?  I've got to see this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you just...  Okay.  How do you know your fucking terminate's okay? 
[01:06:30]  Because that's not what they had to do.  They just had to fix my deviated septum.  Okay.  And I just couldn't breathe out of this one side.  It was completely closed shut.  Yeah, man.  It's fucking brutal, dude.  Yeah, you'll be really happy.  But I can breathe better now than I've breathed in 10 years, so...  Wow.  I'll go get the drops in.  He's pretty righteous.  There he is.  There's his music.  I'm going to get my drops for Kenny.  And I... 
[01:07:00]  I don't feel so good.  Oh, but I look great.  You don't look great.  He looks like he came back way too soon.  Yeah?  Any normal place, if you were a boss, you would look at that and go, you know what?  I don't give a fuck about paperwork.  What the fuck?  Why don't you go home for another day or two?  Yeah.  Get your shit together.  Well, as long as in, you know, a month or two, he'll be looking great. 
[01:07:30]  Feeling good.  He gets a little fucking edgy there.  I don't think he likes this bit.  I don't think he likes this one bit.  No?  No.  He's really getting a little testy with this whole thing.  There he is.  Are you still on Painkillers, Troy?  No.  What?  Nah, they fuck you up, dude.  Well, yeah, that's the job.  Of the Painkiller.  You can't fucking shit.  You can't piss.  You can't jizz.  What?  You can't do anything. 
[01:08:00]  Where do they put you on?  Percocets.  Oh, man.  Look at him breathing hard.  He's breathing heavy.  I'm fucked, dude.  I'm really in bad shape, dude.  Wow.  You are fucked.  I'm ready to fucking pass out, man.  You're breathing probably through your mouth so much that you're probably getting lightheaded.  That's all.  I'm ready to pass out.  Yeah.  You will be fine, though.  I went to see Motorhead and fucking Heaven and Hell and Priest three days after surgery.  God, the fucking music alone.  I was rocking out.  You were, Jimmy.  Yeah, you were.  Gonna get my body healed very quickly. 
[01:08:30]  Oh.  Well, what we got in front of us is Kenny, and we need to put eye drops in his eye.  Are you ready?  It's still a little red.  Well, his eye head's back.  Kenny's head is way back.  You really can't do this yourself, Kenny.  Well, I'm gonna try.  Yes.  He's gonna miss.  He's gonna close his eyes and just pour it on his eyes.  It's okay.  I want to see what he does.  No, no, no.  You're not doing it wrong.  That's automatically you're doing it wrong.  You take your thumb and your pointer finger, and you open your eye, and you just hold it open.  You have to hold.  I can't even do it with my eye like that. 
[01:09:00]  And I'm doing it for 20 years.  I'm a good shot.  You're not, though.  I'm a good shot.  Hold it open with your eyes like that.  I'm telling you.  Okay, man.  Hold it open.  All the way back.  Look straight up.  And realize it's nothing.  It's just a drop.  It's not gonna hurt you.  No, no.  He's not even close to the top.  No, but he's just missing.  But your eye stayed open.  It hit his cheek, though.  It moved his whole head.  Go back again.  Try it again.  Because your eye, you literally just missed your eye.  He's able to open his eye.  That's good.  With his two fingers.  What are you rushing for?  Watch.  It's way up high.  Did he get it? 
[01:09:30]  Yes, he did.  Kenny, you did it.  See?  It wasn't a bullseye, though.  That's all right.  But it's good.  You know.  It's easy.  Look, he wants to put more drops in.  He's all excited.  He's cocky.  Now he's excited that he finally figured out.  He's very excited.  No, he's not even hitting it.  He needs some practice at it.  But you will be able to do it.  Something got in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He dripped in.  Unfortunately, it's not a 45.  Putting a contact lens in.  Any of that shit.  You get so used to it so fast. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Eyes are like, fucking, yeah.  You don't have to be fucked with.  Oh, wow.  That is red.  I had my sinuses done once, too.  You did?  Yeah.  It was a cute story, but it's too long.  Well, why were you bringing it up?  Now you have to tell it.  That shit drives listeners crazy.  Good for them.  Do you have a short version of the story?  No, it's like I had to have my sinuses done.  It was supposed to be same-day surgery.  And I went.  You got to be there early in the morning. 
[01:10:30]  When I got there, it was like dark.  And they give you like the gown to put on.  And it was like a reclining chair.  And the lights were out.  So I said, oh, this isn't bad.  Because I was trying to remain calm.  And then like all of a sudden, they bring the stretcher in.  And they bring me in a room.  And there had to be 40 other people lined up waiting to get fucking surgery in this bright fucking room.  And you're all like looking at each other.  There's nowhere else to look.  And then the fucking nurse comes over and kept yelling at me to put the stupid hat on. 
[01:11:00]  And I said, I'm not putting the hat on.  Why wouldn't you?  The hat.  Because it looks dumb.  It looks dumb.  You're not impressing anyone there.  Yeah.  I don't care.  You didn't want to look dumb no matter what.  Yeah, so she kept yelling at me about putting the hat on.  And then I said, I want to see my doctor.  Because I want to make sure he wasn't hung over or all fucked up or something.  So I had to talk to him.  That's a viable.  Yeah, I can understand how you want that.  So then I wanted to see the anesthesiologist too.  Because like they started coming in. 
[01:11:30]  And they were like wearing clogs.  Yeah.  And I don't go for that.  No man should wear clogs.  You made them take their clogs off?  Well, no, I wanted to see.  That was for like other people, you know.  So then my guy came.  And he was an American.  But he wasn't wearing clogs.  So I was okay with it.  Well, the clogs are probably for their comfort.  I don't care.  Men should not wear clogs.  That's where the Crocs came from, right?  I don't go for that.  Hospitals?  Oh, yeah.  Are they?  I think so.  I think they were made for hospitals at first.  And then they decided everyone should wear them. 
[01:12:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, so they wheel me in.  I have my operation.  And then, you know, they give you speed to wake you up in the recovery room.  And then I woke up.  And the nurse was right on me.  And she's like, do you know so-and-so-so?  I go, lady, I just had a fucking operation.  I wasn't ready for a test.  He must have been a rowdy patient, man.  What a treat you were.  Well, it turns out she was my brother's next-door neighbor.  And that's what she was asking me.  And it turned out in my benefit because she gave me a private recovery room with a fucking TV, which was nice of her. 
[01:12:30]  Oh.  I'm going in the recovery room for you.  Well, that's the interesting part, Jay.  Oh, thank God.  Yeah, because...  Thank God.  It was supposed to be same-day surgery.  And then the doctor came in with, like, his $1,000 suit on.  Like, he was, like, just checking on me before.  And Troy mentions the packing in your nose.  So he goes to pull it out of my fucking nose.  And this, like, gauze rope tube, he, like, pulls it down to your belly button.  It's like a foot long. 
[01:13:00]  And then one of my nostrils started gushing blood.  And it got all over his fucking nice suit and everything.  And this is, like, back when AIDS was first invented.  So they were, like, freaking out.  AIDS was first invented.  Well, some do think it was invented, so...  Yeah, so they were freaking out because my blood is all over his nice suit and everything.  Wow, yeah.  And the nurse is trying to, like, get it off with, like, hydrogen peroxide or whatever.  And then, like, they couldn't stop the bleeding.  So he said, like, I couldn't go home that night.  I had to fucking stay there. 
[01:13:30]  So I said, well, you know, I need a private room.  I'm not, like, sharing a room with anybody.  And they gave me a private room.  And then, like, the next day, they were, like, they insist you get in a wheelchair.  They have to wheel you out.  Why?  Is that just so you don't fall?  They can't have one?  It's just to stop any potential litigation?  It's a lawsuit thing, yeah.  I don't know.  And then, like, my wife was, like, pulling the car up.  And then, like, a guy I worked with's father was, like, coming in to visit somebody.  And it looked, I had black eyes. 
[01:14:00]  It looked like I got the worst beating of my life.  And I'm sitting in a wheelchair, like, and he's, like, what happened to you?  I go, oh, I had my sinuses done.  He's, like, oh, yeah, sure you did.  And he just walked away from me.  That's my entire story.  Oh, no, the last part was, you know that blog, the booger thing on YouTube?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had to go to the doctor a week later for a follow-up.  And he pulled the biggest blood booger out of my nose.  It looked like a giant slug. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, God.  Did you eat it?  I would have eaten that bad boy.  But it was pretty cool.  Now that's my entire story.  This is what came out of my body.  That's pretty tough.  I ain't eating.  It's actually, it looks like a...  Oh, my God, what is that?  Hey, look, it doesn't look like a booger.  I saw it already.  I looked.  I was like an abortion.  I did.  But what is that, officially?  I don't know.  It just came flying out of my body.  It looks like an abortion.  Out of your nose, right?  Yeah, it was probably about that big.  Yeah.  About the size of a baseball.  Yeah, like a large oyster.  Yeah, I was like, I have to take a fucking picture of that. 
[01:15:00]  It's crazy.  Did you smell it?  No, no.  I just flushed it down the toilet.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I would have saved it.  What would you have to do with it?  Put in a little jar.  Put it in the freezer.  Save it for later.  Ten your eye all right.  Okay.  Yes, thank you for your concern.  You do realize you were fast asleep yesterday, right?  Yeah, it happens.  You have apnea.  I've flown with him.  He's in the world.  Oh, God.  I'm watching him die and then live.  And then die and then live. 
[01:15:30]  I'm getting the machine.  You should get the machine.  No, pain is a lifestyle.  Thank you to all the people who sent me emails, by the way.  Because there's CPAP.  There's BiPAP.  There's different ones.  And, you know, one has constant air.  And one has air that it regulates.  So you can breathe.  Because you're breathing out against constant air.  But I can't wait to get my results and find out what I need.  If I have to pay for it myself, I will.  I need a machine, man.  Yeah.  I know it's uncomfortable to have.  But I've been waking up gasping.  Oh.  My heart's racing.  Like, it's very, very bad for your heart. 
[01:16:00]  Very dangerous.  Jimmy.  Every day I'm waking up exhausted.  Like, I did Caroline this weekend.  I felt high.  I was waking up.  And within 15 minutes, I'm sitting there and myself are just loopy and stoned.  Like, I felt stoned.  Oh, man.  And then I'm doing the shows.  And I can't nap.  I try to fucking nap.  And it's like.  It's fucking awful, dude.  That shit wakes you up.  Because that's why I piss so much.  I read that somewhere.  What?  It's like, you're not breathing.  So your body causes something to wake you up.  So you breathe.  Wow.  So, uh.  That's funny.  I can't wait to get a machine. 
[01:16:30]  Damn it.  Fucking scary, man.  And I gotta get my turbinates re-shrunk.  Yeah.  How do they show up?  They do it with heat.  It's an office visit.  It's not surgery anymore.  Because instead of scraping them.  Because that's what causes so much blood.  A lot of the guys do it through a heat.  Where they just.  They inject you.  And they go down into your fucking sinus.  To your turbinates.  And they shock them with something.  And then they.  It shrinks them a little bit.  Sounds harrowing.  Yeah.  Troy Cohn's just staring off into space. 
[01:17:00]  I'm ready to fucking pass out.  I'm not feeling good.  Yeah.  I really feel like shit, dude.  You think you're going to puke?  No, I don't feel like I'm going to puke.  I just feel very lightheaded.  I just.  I'm still up.  Have a banana.  I had a DJ last night, too.  So I'm still up from last night.  Is there anyone.  That's why.  When you can talk to around here.  Yeah, that's right.  Logically.  You're tired because you stayed up all night.  After surgery.  Well, yeah.  I know.  I'm just.  I get sent home if you stayed up all night DJing.  Well, I'm going to sweat it out today, but I have to do it, man.  I got to fucking make a living.  Are you DJing tonight?  No, no, no.  I'm just going to go home and sleep. 
[01:17:30]  But yeah, I literally.  From after the surgery till yesterday, I just slept, woke up, ate, and just kept sleeping.  You only have to go through that first week once, and you're through with it.  What's the big song in the clubs?  Right now?  Yeah, what's the one that gets the whole fucking place going?  Any Pitbull.  Everybody loves Pitbull.  Give me one.  Rihanna.  Give me one.  I want to hear one that gets the whole club jumping.  Everything Tonight.  Yeah, that's a Pitbull single.  Yeah.  Okay, I don't know.  Let's hear that. 
[01:18:00]  Should we go break with this shit?  Because we got Jim Abbott.  We got to get ready for the big Jim Abbott interview.  Jim Abbott is coming in.  Promoting his book.  I didn't realize it was 93 he threw that no-hitter.  I thought he was pitching in those championship years.  He's at the last Barnes & Noble tonight.  Wow, right.  Where is that?  Broadway in 82nd at 7 p.m. tonight, signing his new book, Imperfect and Improbable Life,  in bookstores and Amazon now.  To me, and I said to Opie off the air, he's the most amazing athlete we'll ever have in  here.  We had Kareem. 
[01:18:30]  Jim Abbott.  We had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  The most amazing athlete.  He even changed his name.  Yes, that's right.  And it didn't affect his play.  So did Jim.  His real name is not Jim Abbott.  Really?  What was it?  Jim Costello.  Oh, I know this song.  I actually know this one.  Ladies love pit bull.  Yeah?  Mr. 305.  Mr. 305.  Oh, we got a phone call for Jimmy.  This guy says, don't get the machine, Jimmy.  Oh, of course.  There's something better out there. 
[01:19:00]  What is it, Mark?  Play a shotgun.  What's going on?  Oh, hey.  Jimmy, I had apnea really bad, man, to the point where waking up, not breathing, my wife  is panicking.  She's like, oh, my God, you stop breathing.  You're going to get this checked out.  So I went to the doctor, had the whole test done, did the sleep test, was offered a couple  different options, and was told by so many guys that I know that have apnea that use the  machine that they use it for like a month.  And then they stopped using it because it's so uncomfortable, leaves marks on your face, 
[01:19:30]  you break out.  It's just disgusting.  Well, I know what you're saying.  What is the option?  There's a dental thing.  The option is called the pillar procedure.  Uh-oh.  If a doctor hasn't offered it to you, man, listen to me.  They take little strands of surgical-type suture material like they would use to tie you  up on the inside.  They implant it in the roof of your mouth.  Dude, I went from being like 30 pounds overweight and tired every day of my life to losing weight, 
[01:20:00]  feeling excellent.  What does the pillar procedure do?  Is that kind of like shocking?  Is that kind of akin to scarring the palate so it doesn't collapse?  They support it because what happens is the soft palate in your mouth collapses, and that's  what causes your airway to obstruct and close.  How is that possible?  They put these.  If you Google it, and you Google it, Google it.  If you do that, and you'll see that they inject these, they insert these things into the roof 
[01:20:30]  of your mouth, and over time, scar tissue builds around it, and it supports the roof  of your mouth.  It works for you, but I've heard that sometimes it's not foolproof, and there are downsides  to it.  I've been recommended against that, but I've heard of the procedure, but it doesn't work  for everybody.  I'm two and a half years in now.  I'm sorry.  How long could you not talk for?  Like, what was the...  Because, you know, again, I have to talk.  Right.  The first week sucked dick.  Not to mention that I also had my uvula in the back of my throat cut in half. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, Jesus.  You're a disaster.  Yeah.  No, stop.  No, they split that shit.  I sleep better.  A little disaster.  My brother had that.  My brother had a complete...  Actually, his was completely removed.  His uvula?  Really?  Yeah.  He opens his mouth.  It's just this massive fucking hole now.  Isn't that bad?  Wow.  They got rid of all sorts of shit in there.  I don't know.  The first week was brutal.  I mean, it really was.  The first week was brutal.  I mean, obviously, you got to do it when, you know, you're either out of the studio or, 
[01:21:30]  you know...  It's just...  It's rough.  But different...  Completely different person, man.  And I mean, just for all personal reasons, not wanting that machine.  It's loud.  It's obstructive.  You got to sleep on your back all the time.  And what about...  Not if you get a nose one.  And Jimmy, what about when the girls come by?  Fuck them.  They're paid anyway.  They're going to have to turn off...  Oh, they don't spend the night?  Yeah.  So they're long gone when you have to put that machine on.  And dude, the nose...  This is why I get my turbinate trunk, because they have these nose pillars, they call them,  or nose pillows, that you lock it into the nose, and the air can come that way. 
[01:22:00]  It's all the mask you get.  You got to get the right mask for yourself.  Right.  But people...  I've gotten a hundred and something emails from people.  I Twittered about it, raving about how their lives are different.  But you'll get some guys like this guy who just didn't like it and tried another option.  But I want to try the mask first.  It was an option for me, and he said that to me.  He said, if you want to try the mask first, he said, you know, no doubt, give it a shot.  He said, but I'm just telling you from my experience, and this procedure is fairly new when it first  came out, so I think I was taking a little bit of a risk by going for it. 
[01:22:30]  But completely, completely changed.  Just, I mean, I still snore.  My wife reminds me constantly, but, you know, I don't stop breathing, you know, which is  the huge part.  And, I mean, just the level of energy and the weight loss and everything else.  I mean, I'm so ugly as sin, but, you know.  Thanks for the call.  Because Colin, I saw Colin last night, and he goes, he said the uvula surgery.  He goes, you don't want that.  But maybe because we talk for a living that the risk is, not that it's not important for 
[01:23:00]  other people, but.  My brother sounds exactly the same.  He does, right?  If that matters.  I sound exactly the same.  I got it removed.  There was no, there was no issues they were talking about.  You could have issues swallowing.  You could have none of that, man.  Okay.  And, I mean, hey, maybe I'm a fluke.  Who the hell knows?  But it was worth it 100 times, 100%.  I'm going to try the machine.  Even though I hate stuff on my face like that, I just paused.  I figured there was a cock and balls reference coming on.  You said it.  You said it, not me.  I still want that mask, because I know that it's just, I can't wait to get that on my 
[01:23:30]  fucking fat face.  All right, Mark and Jersey, thanks for the call, buddy.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  Troy, go pass out somewhere.  Kenny, thank you.  Jim Abbott is up next.  I have one more thing to say.  What?  What happened?  DC Improv is selling very well.  Yeah, Jimmy's going to be watching DC Improv Thursday to Saturday, April 12th to the 14th.  Thank you.  Saturday, I think, is the early show.  It's definitely sold out in the late show.  It's selling very, very well.  I saw it counts.  It's great.  That's great.  Please don't procrastinate.  Buy your tickets now.  And that's next weekend. 
[01:24:00]  A week from this weekend, yeah.  Yeah, this weekend is Good Friday and Easter.  Yay.  I want to whisper a tweet from Kevin from Conn, C-O-N-N, just in case Jim Abbott is listening  right now.  Yeah.  He wants to know if the book was written in shorthand.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh, no.  See, that's the kind of thing.  That might be a problem.  Why?  He's not listening right now.  He might be.  I hope not.  Hey, why don't you put on the show so I could hear the show. 
[01:24:30]  But I whispered it.  I've whispered it.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  I'm still looking forward to chatting with Jim Abbott.  Oh, of course.  He's a legend.  Jim Abbott next.  Stay there.  The OPN SA Show.  Uh.  Well, Jim Abbott is late. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, boy.  Might be a great pitcher, but.  Oh, you know.  Yeah, well, he's not good with time.  You're right, Sam.  Boy.  Oh, the watch.  Oh, I get it.  Uh, Jim Abbott promoting Imperfect and Improbable Life in bookstores and Amazon now.  Big book signing tonight at, uh, probably the last Barnes & Noble in Manhattan on Broadway in 82nd.  There's one in, uh, Union Square, too, I think. 
[01:25:30]  The one near, uh, the one near Madison Square Garden.  You've had book signings there.  That's bookends.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  That was, uh.  That was, uh, the other one.  Borders.  Borders.  Borders, okay.  Is that closed, too?  Yeah.  So, is the Borders in the Time Warner Center?  I forgot.  I needed some kind of, I don't remember anymore, but I needed a book, and I'm like, I know there's one down near Madison Square Garden, because Jimmy did signings there.  So, I'll just, uh, jump on the subway and go down there.  Get out of the subway, and I look, and it's just a big, empty space. 
[01:26:00]  Nothing's in there.  Wow.  I'm like, are you kidding me?  Kindles are just killing them.  It's all that shit.  There's no need to buy books.  I mean, it's all that shit.  Well, Kindles are in.  Digital, fucking.  I mean, I mean.  I would assume Kindle's in trouble, too, because now everyone's just reading it on their iPad.  Nah, Kindle, I think Amazon is big enough.  The purists are still using the Kindle, but the average Joe's like, you know what, this is good enough for me to read a book every once in a while.  I have a Kindle, because it doesn't hurt my eyes.  I have a Kindle, too.  I love it.  Well, yeah, they have that technology, which is great.  I love it.  It feels like you're reading a real, you know, book page without straining your eyes. 
[01:26:30]  And you've got to use the little light on it, but I have the little teensy-weensy one, and I just, you know, bing, boom, zip, bing, boom, zip.  Is that how you read?  Do you actually say that while you're reading?  Yeah, just like, you know, flip, plug, zing, boom.  Books going away.  That's fucked up.  They are, man.  Done.  It's fucked up.  Done-ski.  I don't think you would read, I don't think you read more books, because it's on a Kindle.  Because you used to go through a bookstore, and you just would go, ah, you know what, and you just pick up a bunch of dumb little things. 
[01:27:00]  You're not going to do that anymore, I don't think.  No.  As much, anyway.  Yeah, I kind of love the books.  You know what, they do take up a lot of room, dude.  I hate having books in my house.  They take up a lot of room.  I throw them away as soon as I'm done.  You don't put them on display?  You don't display your books?  The signed ones.  I don't know, that seems to be something you do in one of those houses that kind of, you know, you've got books.  Maybe a signed book or something, sure, but as soon as I'm done with a book, I throw it away or leave it behind for somebody else.  I have so many signed books I've got to put in storage. 
[01:27:30]  I burn them while yelling out fucking horrible rhetoric.  Nice.  What's up with Jim Abbott?  I think we're on downstairs waiting.  Okay.  I am.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.  So, Jim.  Go.  Walk us through it.  You're on that mound.  You jostle that rosin bag.  You're looking into the heart of the abyss.  What goes through your mind?  That's good.  We could talk about the hooker that accepts burgers as payment. 
[01:28:00]  That's just sad, right?  Is that the type of hooker you would get, Jimmy?  One that would accept burgers?  It's a dream come true.  No, I wouldn't like my car smelling like burgers.  Hey, I don't want a hamburger.  It's just sad.  They were doing a little advising.  Man, I will suck your dick.  It's just sad.  What'd you say?  Mm-hmm.  Florida detective was trolling for hookers when he pulled up to a 47-year-old suspect and  asked if she wanted a ride.  The woman accepted the offer, got in the undercover vehicle, and engaged in a conversation about 
[01:28:30]  snacks.  About snacks.  Cop explained that he was looking to fuck.  So, I see you brought some cheeseburgers with you.  And asked the woman if she wanted to help me out with that.  He actually said, the fuck.  The woman, the detective reporter, replied that the pair couldn't go have sexual intercourse  if I bought her two double cheeseburgers off the dollar menu at McDonald's. 
[01:29:00]  Can't lose, man.  That's a bargain.  You think that's a good deal?  How fucking sad is that?  But you ain't getting pickles with that bitch.  That's what the cops are wasting their fucking time doing?  Mm-hmm.  Wow, they must be great fucking, they must be super cops if that's what they got them doing.  Don't bust the whore who needs money to eat.  She's getting hamburgers.  Fuck.  God damn, this country.  What do we care about that shit for?  I don't know.  The cop added, I agreed to the deal and purchased the hamburgers for $2.75. 
[01:29:30]  $2.75.  In addition to the cheeseburgers, the woman told the undercover that he could also give  her a tip.  In response, the cop handed over $60.  $60.  Terrible.  The woman kept 40, took the McDonald's grub, and directed the cop to a vacant parking  lot to park, to park, and to complete the deal.  Well, he's obviously a, you know, I know that they assigned him this stuff to do, but it's  just a fucking disgrace.  Stop talking and start sucking. 
[01:30:00]  Hamburg.  Oh, fuck.  Hamburg.  I'm going to fuck you in the mouth.  So, is it disgrace?  Hamburg.  I'll lick my sweaty balls.  So, they go to the parking lot, and then the takedown team arrested her.  Oh, that's good.  There's a takedown team.  Yeah, a whole team set up to stop a girl for sucking dick so she can buy hamburgers.  That's good.  That's not a waste of our money. 
[01:30:30]  So, she'll appear in court May 1st.  That's a good start.  Oh, here he is.  That is Jim Abbott right there, ladies and gentlemen.  Very cool.  Yes.  Hey, Mr. Abbott.  Mr. Abbott, take a seat, sir.  How are you, sir?  Very excited to have you.  Hello, how are you?  Good, how's it going?  Very cool.  Jim Abbott.  Wow, in our studio.  Very cool.  Promoting imperfect and improbable life in bookstores now.  You look the same.  I know, right?  Except for less hair.  Man. 
[01:31:00]  Well, it's hard for us, we never noticed, because you always had the hat on, so you guys  could really lose all your hair and nobody would notice.  You have.  Yeah, definitely.  So, what made you want to, not what made you want to write a book, but why, it's been  a few years since you retired, and now all of a sudden the book, what kind of prompted  this was the time to do it?  Well, there was a lot of different reasons for that.  You know, I played differently.  I grew up missing a right hand, and in a lot of ways, baseball and sports helped me to  come to terms with that.  You know, I mean, to be on a team meant something to me, to play baseball, to be a part of that 
[01:31:30]  helped me to try to move past the label, at least in my own mind.  But, you know, I discovered during my career, to the later part of my career, and now after  I'm done playing, that my hand was a big part of who I was.  It was a big part of the ambition and the drive that I had.  And it really wasn't until after a couple years I was away from baseball, I was away  from the sheltered world that that is, that I was able to kind of bring these thoughts  together and say, you know, there's a long form to this. 
[01:32:00]  I'd like to be able to explain it in a book.  Are you in the Hall of Fame?  No.  You should be in the Hall of Fame.  Simply, if you threw two pitches in a row in baseball, you should be in the Hall of Fame.  It's the most, I say you're the most amazing athlete we'll ever have in here.  Because to be able to pitch, and you're, you would, what would, the system, if you could  explain to people how you would do everything with one hand on the mound, every single play  of the game you're involved in?  Yeah, you know, I used to have to throw and catch with the same hand. 
[01:32:30]  So I, it was a system I developed with my dad.  He bought me a glove at a local drugstore, and we started playing catch.  And I would just cradle the, I wore a right-hander mitt on my left hand, and I would cradle  the glove in my right arm and pull the ball out and continue the rotation.  The glove would sit on my right hand or half a hand, and I would throw and then have the  ball ready to put it right back on.  It's an amazing move to watch because it's so fast and smooth.  Was there ever, I was thinking of logistical problems like maybe callusing from having to 
[01:33:00]  put the glove on and take it off so many times during the game?  Would that happen?  You know, it's funny.  Nobody's ever asked me that.  I was thinking that.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  Well, he wasn't going to ask you, but I said, talk to him about callusing.  Callusing.  Yeah, callusing.  No, it's just one of those things because most players, you know, you put the glove on,  it stays there until you go back to the dugout.  But, you know, that, you're constantly taking that glove off and putting it back on.  Any problems?  You know, that's, you know, I mean, minor problems. 
[01:33:30]  Callusing, I don't know.  Callusing.  I did used to, you know, push some of the skin back.  I mean, I would have these.  Oh, yeah, really?  Yeah, a little bit.  It would, you know, because it was so, I did it so often.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, it was great when I got to the major leagues.  I had a glove company, Rawlings, that helped me to, you know, so they sat down with me and  said, okay, you've been doing it this way for a long time, how can we build a glove that  will help you to do this faster?  Wow, man.  So they kind of reconfigured the opening, they made it a little bit bigger, they took  out some of the insides, and so that really helped the speed of the transition. 
[01:34:00]  I want to go all the way back to Little League.  Obviously, it makes it to the majors, but I think it's more amazing that it came up with  baseball and we're given a chance.  Yeah, that's true.  To shine, because, I mean, especially Little League, you have to bat.  Yeah.  So how are you getting recognized, besides the obvious, you know, for your skills?  You know, you'd think they'd have said soccer might be better.  Yes!  You know, I mean, that was, I grew up in Flint, Michigan, and, you know, I'll say something  you don't hear a lot, I come from the great town of Flint, Michigan, and I was just surrounded 
[01:34:30]  by tremendous people who had an open-mindedness, who had an optimism that if I wanted to do something,  they were going to find a way to do it.  And, you know, if it started with my dad switching the glove on and off, or a Little  League coach saying, hey, we're going to grip the bat down by the end, use the knob, and  wrap your left hand around and swing the bat, there was always somebody there who helped  me devise the ways to get through life.  I think that's kind of amazing, because there's a lot of Little League coaches that don't have 
[01:35:00]  the open mind like that.  And if you're too short or something, they're not even going to bother with you.  But for some reason, they, you know, they spent some time with you to figure all this  out. Were you that good from an early age?  I was pretty good, yeah. You know, in second grade, I won the softball long toss, first  and second place. And that was an indicator of my future success. But, you know, I had  athletic ability. And, you know, that's one of the things I try to say. I was given so 
[01:35:30]  much more than was taken away from me. So the point was to make the most of that.  Right. And then you move on to high school ball. You had a hit in high school, right?  I hit in high school, yeah. And you still had people that noticed your talents. What  was your batting average in high school?  My senior year, I hit .427.  Wow.  There you go. So you obviously figured it out. I hit some home runs. You know, I could  hit until they started throwing curveballs.  And what was it about the curveball that it was tough to hit? I mean, obviously, it's 
[01:36:00]  tough to hit for anyone. But for you in particular, was it a little more difficult?  Well, I think, well, I hit left-handed. So my left hand was on my backside. And my right  hand was kind of balanced. And I would pull through. But basically, my swing was long.  And I just kind of got the bat started on that path. So it was hard to make adjustments  within the swing. You know, all I knew about hitting was that it was hard to do, to tell  you the truth.  Right, right.  It's amazing to me, too. Every time you fielded a ground ball, because that comes back very 
[01:36:30]  quickly. Right at you. And to have to have the glove back on, throw the ball, and then  it comes out. You have to field it. You take the glove off, switch hands, and throw it.  And it was like you played the position as well as any pitcher. That, to me, was the  most amazing thing to watch, was you fielding a ground ball.  Well, you had to take advantage of those outs. You know, those outs come at a premium,  and you better be able to field your position. And I took great pride in that. You know,  I played for the Angels out in L.A. And we had a great old coach, a guy named Jimmy  Reese, who was in his 80s when I got there. And Jimmy used to walk out during batting 
[01:37:00]  practice. He had this cut-off fungo bat that he cut in half so it was light. And he wielded  this thing like a weapon. He could hit ground ball after ground ball with perfect timing.  And we'd go out in the outfield, he'd put two hats, separate them, and he'd do ten in  a row. If he got one by you, he owed him a Coke. And if he didn't, he owed you a Coke.  And it was a fun game, but I really credit him in those drills with helping me to find the  rhythm of following through and then getting that glove back on and being ready.  And people who know baseball, I mean, again, the most amazing thing was that you threw 
[01:37:30]  a no-hitter. It was in Yankee Stadium against Cleveland. And it's a Freddie pitcher.  1993.  1993. I thought it was later than that. I didn't realize that that was so many years ago.  Were there a few errors in that game? I'm trying to think if that's the game I remember.  Shane Spencer made an error? No? Am I thinking of a different one?  No. I don't think there was any errors. As a matter of fact, there were some great plays.  Wade Boggs made a diving play. I got Albert Bell by one step late in the game. Yankee 
[01:38:00]  Stadium erupted. That's kind of like when everybody was invested in it and doing that  countdown. I walked a few guys. It wasn't a perfect game. Hence, the book that I wrote  is centered around that game and the idea of the game not being perfect, but being great  and memorable. And I love the game because it's given me a great connection with the city  and with the Yankee organization and the great Yankee fans.  How did you feel about the press coming to New York? Because that's something that everybody 
[01:38:30]  talks about when somebody comes to New York for the first time. Were they nice to you?  Yeah. They were nice to me. All in all, they were fair to me. And I didn't pitch as well  as I hoped to here in New York. I came with great expectations. They traded some good players  to get me here. And I let some people down professionally here. And the media treated me  the way they should have treated me. For somebody who came here with high expectations, they wrote  exactly what they should. And in some weird way, that was exactly what I wanted. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, really?  I didn't want the focus to be, you know, hey, give this guy credit. He's out there trying  with one hand.  You don't want to be the guy who pitches well, even though you just want to be...  Even though. It's like, no, wait a minute. You're a starting pitcher in the Yankees rotation.  You're expected to win. And in some ways, I walked backwards into the door where I always  wanted to go.  And what year did you leave here? What years did you pitch for the Yankees? For some reason, 
[01:39:30]  I didn't realize it was 93, and it wasn't really long ago.  I know. 93 and 94. 94 was my last year, that terrible year where we were really good in  the strike.  The strike. We got six games in first, right?  Oh, my God.  Brutal.  Yeah, that was a rough one. And it's funny. Then Mattingly, I think, I remember his last  game in the stadium, which I want to say was 95. And him and Ruben Sierra hit back-to-back  home runs, and I was buying a hot dog and missed them both. I actually watched them  both on a monitor getting a hot dog from Mattingly's last. But you see these guys leave, and then 
[01:40:00]  all of a sudden, the dynasty kind of happened right after that. But that was just...  Unbelievable.  They had nothing to do with you. Who'd they trade for you?  J.T. Snow, Jerry Nielsen, and Russ Springer, I think, were the three guys who they traded  for me. So J.T. Snow, those guys had good careers.  Yeah, I believe he was a guy who murdered the Yankees. He was one of those guys like  Geronimo Barroa that just beat the shit out of the Yankees. Albert Bell was another one,  too. When you just said you got him out, people were probably happy on any level to get Albert 
[01:40:30]  Bell out.  He was ferocious. He was rough. I did play with him a little bit with the White Sox later on in my  career. But yeah, that no-hitter came against an Indians team that was... They had a good team.  Jim Tomey, right?  Jim Tomey was on that team. Manny Ramirez had just been called up to that team, and he hit  a couple home runs the night before. And the word was that George Steinbrenner wasn't too  happy that this kid who grew up just outside of Yankee Stadium had come in and hit a couple  home runs. And why wasn't he in the Yankee organization? 
[01:41:00]  Who, for you, was the guy that killed you? There had to be one guy that just... Like, I watch  Rivera pitch, and it seems like David Ortiz gave him a hard time, right? There's just  certain guys that give certain guys a hard time. Was there a guy that just owned you and  you could just never quite master?  There was about 50 of them.  The one guy... When I first came up in the major leagues, and a guy who I looked up to  growing up was George Brett. And he wore me out, even though it was lefty on lefty. 
[01:41:30]  You know, you had to change speeds with George Brett. And that wasn't my strength when I  first came up. And if I threw on the outside part of the plate, he was going to hit it the  other way. And if I pitched it on the inside, he pulled it. And I think I single-handedly  gave him the batting title one year.  Is that overrated? Lefty, lefty, righty? Because I always hated when, like, you'd have a guy like  Wade Boggs, who's just such an amazing hitter. And he's up. They're swapping him out and  putting, I guess, like Randy Velarde in, whoever they're putting in all season. And then in the 
[01:42:00]  playoffs, they have him bat against Randy Johnson. Because he's... It's like, why do  they swap guys out so much like that? I think that's an overmanaging thing.  You know, there's a lot of numbers and statistics that back all that stuff up. I have to say,  Buck Showalter, when I was here with the Yankees, was one of the best at inserting guys in situations  that they could do well. It was weird. We would go up into Seattle and face Randy Johnson.  The Yankees at that time were one of the teams that kind of gave Randy a hard time. And Buck  would pitch, or he would hit lefties. Donnie would play, and Paul O'Neill, those guys. And 
[01:42:30]  somehow that got into Randy Johnson's head a little bit. But, you know, it can be overplayed.  It depends on what kind of pitcher you are. You know, my ball cut across the plate. So lefties  actually sometimes were more comfortable against me than righties were. Some switch hitters,  as a matter of fact, the guy who made the last out of the no-hitter, which was Carlos  Baerga, he was a switch hitter. He hit lefty off of me because he didn't like the ball on the  inside part of the plate as a right-hander. So, ball on the outside, ground ball to short  stop, Randy Velarde catches it, and there it was. 
[01:43:00]  Well, some guys do that against Rivera, too. Some switch hitters will actually bat righty  against him because of the way his ball kind of cuts across. That for a lefty, it just  jams you.  Exactly.  And you break a lot of bats.  Yep.  I haven't watched baseball in a while, but I just remember that. I'm just stealing things  other people have said. It could be a total lie.  Anything different about the game now that you look at, whether you like it better or you  don't think it's as good as when you were playing?  I like it just as much. I'm an Angel fan. I live out in Southern California in my baseball 
[01:43:30]  family. So, the game, this time of year, it's great. It's starting back up. Everybody's  excited. The Angels have Albert Pujols out there, so people are fired up. It's going  to be a great year. And I can't get over the popularity of it. For a while there, when  the strike happened, there was some real backlash about the game and this and that. And now,  I was just down in Florida, and I hear stories of people buying spring training tickets for  $85. You know, these replica ballparks. I was in Arizona. They're playing spring training 
[01:44:00]  games in fields that used to be nicer than the stadiums that they'd go home to. It's a  great time for baseball. I think people are excited about it.  And it's such a great day when you go out and it's a nice day out and you're just sitting  in the park because the game is just part of what's going on there. It's something that  you can't really capture watching it at home or anything. It's just, I love going to the  stadium and watching a game. It's a lot of fun. 
[01:44:30]  What do you miss the most about it? Like, it's always interesting to me for athletes because  you guys at one point have to hang it up and have to stop and then start doing something  else. What for you is the hardest part to not be involved with?  You know, the paychecks.  He's being honest.  He's the first guy that said that.  Thank you for being honest.  No, you know, honestly, that was, we'd have played for half a, you know, it's just to be 
[01:45:00]  able to play a game for a living was incredible. I miss, you know, the spring training I really  miss. I miss that, you know, I mean, it's such a kid's game and you can spend hours on  end working on your fielding. You know what I mean? You can work hours on end on just  covering first base and very few things in life I've found afterwards are you able to  specialize and narrow down your focus and your efforts to one thing so, you know, so  completely. So I miss that. But I don't miss the game. I'm a fan of it. I'm so thankful 
[01:45:30]  for the time that I had in it. And I'm appreciative of the affiliation that I have with Major League  Baseball, with the Angels, with the Yankees. And I'm happy doing what I'm doing now.  So you are comfortable still being kind of involved on it, but not on a peripheral, but  not, you know, the day-to-day grind.  Yeah, it is. It is a grind. And that's something I try to talk about in the book is that, you  know, it's tough. It's competitive. You know, I met a general manager one time who said, you  know, I was looking for the guy to replace you this morning.  Oh, wow.  You know, and he said that to everybody. I mean, that's just, I mean, there's always somebody 
[01:46:00]  who wants to take your spot in the rotation. So if you're on the top of your game and  you're doing well, man, there's no better lifestyle. There's nothing better in the world  to do than to play baseball. But if you're struggling, if you're fighting, if you're  stuff like mine was at the end of my career, you know, you have to be perfect every time  out. It's a struggle.  And the book, just so we know, is called Imperfect, An Improbable Life. We're talking  to Jim Abbott, of course, the ex-Yankee pitcher through that amazing no-hitter in 93. 
[01:46:30]  And you're signing tonight, too. We should get that out there, too, because there's  so few bookstores left. Seven o'clock. It's actually not far from where we are. Barnes  and Noble on Broadway and 82nd. It's a great Barnes and Noble. So even if it rains, you'll  be inside. It's not like a little shitty bookstore where you're going to be standing  outside. And it's a great chance to meet a really legendary pitcher. How did you know  that it was time to step down? Like, what happened? Did nobody offer you anything? Or did  you just go, like, I can't do this anymore? You know, there's an old saying in baseball, 
[01:47:00]  the hitters will let you know. And it was loud and clear. Every time out, you know, I  was struggling. I made a comeback. I was released by the Angels, which was a painful  process. And I spent a year out of the game. And I was young. I wasn't yet 30. And I was  looking around. And I missed it. And so I made a comeback. I went to the minor leagues.  And I signed with the White Sox. I played in Hickory, North Carolina. I was a crawdad.  I was a Hickory. I was a Winston-Salem warthog. I traveled all around. And for a whole summer, 
[01:47:30]  for really essentially the first time, I played in the minor leagues. And I made it back to  the majors. I won a game against the Yankees in 1998. One of the greatest teams in the history  of the game. And played a little bit the following year with the Brewers. And worked my way back  into the bullpen. Worked my way back into the Edinburgh bullpen. And I just knew that wasn't  how I wanted to play. I wasn't contributing anymore.  Is it embarrassing? Or is it ego deflating when you're going back to try to fight to 
[01:48:00]  get back to where you were, as opposed to going down to the minors for an injury? Is it harder  to do that? Like, does your mind kind of like, God, these guys know that I was there, but  now I'm here?  Absolutely. I mean, yeah. Do you get sent down to the minor leagues for the free? You know,  I went from the Olympics to the major leagues. And it was good timing. You know, I was in the  right place at the right time. So all I ever knew was the major league lifestyle. And to get sent down  to the minor leagues was, in some ways, eye-opening and a little refreshing. But, you know, 
[01:48:30]  you're sitting in a clubhouse that, you know, you're looking at the TV. And of course, the major  league game is on. And you're looking at your friends. And you're looking at these stadiums that  you know every smell and nuance of. And you want so bad to get back. And that distance  seems incredibly long.  That sounds brutal, though.  Yeah, that's how real it does sound brutal.  I never thought of that. Watching a real, not a real, but a major league.  A real game.  I caught myself.  You know, watching a real baseball game.  I say, you know, I described it perfectly. You described that perfectly.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, there's rumors that you used to hit home runs in batting practice. Rivera says that he 
[01:49:00]  swears you used to hit home runs.  And I did hit a couple home runs off of Ron Guidry.  Really?  Ron used to come to spring training and throw batting practice. And we'd hit and kind of  have some fun. I don't know exactly why we were doing that. But Mariano Rivera was a young  kid, just about ready to break through when I was there. And I found that funny that he  remembered that.  Were you playing when they had that game? Because my first memory of Rivera, he was a starting  pitcher, I think he started as, is when he was against the Mariners, who that year had 
[01:49:30]  just kicked the crap out of the Yankees. And he was brought in, I think, with the bases  loaded and nobody out. And he shut down the side. I want to say it was 90, I might have  been 95. You might have been gone already. Where were you in 95?  Yeah, I know I was gone in 95. He wasn't there when I was there.  Okay. How good does it feel to go back and beat a team once you're gone from them?  You know, it feels pretty good. It feels pretty good. That game that I mentioned, that I made 
[01:50:00]  that comeback. And I started in Hickory, North Carolina. And I'll never forget, it was September  of that year, finally, when I made it back to the big leagues. And they called me up and  said, you know, good news, you're back in the big leagues. Number 25 is hanging in your locker,  Comiskey Park. Bad news, you're pitching against the Yankees Saturday night.  Oh, man, yeah.  And they were one of the great teams ever. I mean, and, you know, there's Derek Jeter,  and there's Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill, my friend, and pitching against Andy Pettit  that night. And, you know, we beat them. We beat the Yankees that night. And one of 
[01:50:30]  the great moments and highlights of my career, Joe Torrey walked by. And a classy man. I knew  him when he was an angel announcer. And he kind of looked at me and shook his head. He  had this mock indignation. And he had this piece of peppermint gum in his hand. And he  fired it at me. Hit me right in the chest. And he gave me the thumbs up.  Right on.  Oh, damn.  And he said, welcome back.  Hey, Jim Abbott's got to go in a couple minutes. But I want to go back to your childhood real  quickly. Your parents obviously didn't coddle you. I've read that over the years. You know,  you're born with a half a hand. How do they handle that with you and allow you to, you 
[01:51:00]  know, take care of your own, you know, problems and issues in school?  You know, that was one of the things in the book I wanted to pay tribute to is my parents.  You know, their strength. And they didn't coddle me. You know, they didn't shield me from  experience. And they didn't say, hey, soccer makes more sense for you. You know, if you  want to play baseball and your grades are good enough, that's fine. And what I love about 
[01:51:30]  my parents is that they made me feel as though I was special for being born this way. And  I know special is a word that has a lot of connotation, but it was a responsibility. My  dad said, you, what's been taken away once will be given back twice. This is something  to be lived up to. And you have the ability to do that. And that was the gift my parents  gave me.  Wow. And, and were the kids, uh, overly mean or how did that work out as you were growing  up?  You know, kids can be cruel, you know, for the most part.  But how'd you get through that? 
[01:52:00]  Baseball.  Really?  Baseball.  Man.  Basketball, football, shooting hoops. You know, there were a lot of times I went out there  and, and, and shot hoops till I, you know, was sweating and go inside and, and I just fought  my way through it, you know, but in sports, you know, I encourage people to find something  you love to do. And then you can channel that passion. And, and, you know, that mound was,  was a place for me to fight back against low expectations. That mound was a place for me  to go out and prove myself. And I'm so fortunate to have had that venue. 
[01:52:30]  Wow.  And you're an inspiration, obviously, for a lot of other people.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Born with, you know, handicaps or people saying you can't do it. I mean, you must have  heard that your entire career that you've inspired a lot of people.  We're surrounded by influences, what we can't do, right?  Right.  And, and, and, uh, Lance Armstrong in his book, you know, described him as the daily  creeping negatives. And I love his use of the words daily and creeping, you know,  cause we're, we're, we're surrounded by these things. And yet, you know, if I had  one purpose in the book and, and there were a few, but I just want people to know 
[01:53:00]  that the situation that you're in or the condition that you were born to doesn't  have to define you, you know, with, with, with, with optimism and creativity and  belief, amazing things are possible.  You've proven that. Absolutely. Fantastic.  Thank you.  The book is called, again, it's Imperfect and Improbable Life, Jim Abbott. And again,  if you're here in New York, you can meet Jim tonight. He will be signing at seven  o'clock Barnes and Noble. It's a great store on a Broadway and 82nd. There's plenty of room 
[01:53:30]  and a book signing is a fun thing to go to. You start getting more eager as you get up  to the front. And then just, just don't ask Jim any stupid questions. We've covered all  of them. All right. Jim, thanks so much, man. Absolutely. This has been great. Thank  you. Yep. Jim Abbott, everyone. Once again, the Greg O.B. Hughes Literature Society presents  another informative book review. What did he say? Keep it by the what? Man, I forgot. 
[01:54:00]  What? Keep it by the shitter. Oh.  Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus. 
[01:54:30]  What the fuck? I've never seen anybody. Jesus. Did you have a breakfast of sponge? 
[01:55:00]  What? Stay tuned for more book reviews courtesy of the Greg O.B. Hughes Literature Society  and your friends at the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hey, now, this is D.L. Hughley. Hey, this is Brewery. Hey, everybody. It's Joel McHale.  Hi, this is Jim Jeffries. Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon. You're listening to O.B. and Anthony. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, this is Jimmy Fallon. You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  I miss talking to shitty authors. I forgot all about that. The time I peed on the guy's book  while he was on the phone. I used to love when Jimmy would take a book and go, and it  says here on page, and you would rip it out as you're trying to interview the guy. We've  got to get some shitty authors back on the program. Jim Abbott was great, right? Yeah,  he was so nice. Really nice, man. Just a nice guy. He's cool. He's a nice guy. Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Well, he played in the majors for 10 years. What was his record overall? It was a losing  record. I want to say 83 and 100 and something. It was like that. He lost more than he won.  He did. Yeah. Can you look it up, Sam? I don't have it in front of me. It might have been  like, you know, 83 and 115 or some shit. Wow. Why was that? I don't know. I mean,  he had a high like four something ERA, but I imagine that his, I don't know. Let me  say, what's his record? 425 ERA. Yeah, 87 and 108. So he lost, I guess, 13, 21 more 
[01:56:30]  games. And the reason I thought he should be on the Hall of Fame is, and I mean, I guess  they're just treating him like any other pitcher. That's not necessarily a Hall of Fame  record, but it was so amazing. Yeah, you got to make special, you know. Dude, they  had one hand and he threw a no hitter. It's fucking, it's never going to not amaze  me. It should be in that weird wing of the Hall of Fame. Yeah, exactly. With the  midget and I'm just fucking around. Sorry, Mr. ERA. He was great. Of course he was 
[01:57:00]  great. But apnea. What an inspiration. Yeah. But apnea, what are you talking about?  Nothing. I just. We're going from a one handed. I know. I just was thinking. No hitter  to apnea. Just thinking. Just thinking about getting some apnea masks. Just wish there  was a place to go to get them. But there might be. Yeah. Where? Are you having trouble sleeping? 
[01:57:30]  Gregory, are you snoring? Are you gasping for breath? Is your tongue slowly murdering you  by collapsing? Slowly. Your tongue's a murderer. Maybe you can help out Jim Norton because he's  having a problem sleeping, Ted. Nice. I've heard that. How about you, Samuel? Is your  soft palate collapsing like London Bridge? It's a song we sing at Ted's sleep apnea mask  emporium. Oh, wow. Your soft palate's falling down, falling down. Your soft palate's falling 
[01:58:00]  down. My fair lady. We haven't fixed the my fair lady part yet. Yeah, that doesn't quite  happen. It certainly doesn't happen. It's a great point. You'll get there, though. Yes,  there are so many masks. There are so many newfangled sleep apnea masks. What kind of  different masks do you need? Well, you need constant air blowing into the sinus. So what  I'm doing is I've designed a fishbowl and you squeeze your head into it. Like a diving bell. 
[01:58:30]  Yes, you do exactly like a diving bell. But the hard part is cramming in the pillow and putting  your head backwards and we have a Rolls Royce jet engine that blows air up your nose and  into your throat. That sounds a little bit, well, not only dangerous, but probably expensive  to buy a jet engine. Yes, it's a $400,000 mask. It also sounds very loud, Ted. It certainly  is. That's a great point, Gregory. How the fuck are you going to sleep with a jet engine blowing  air into your face? So nobody, no one sleeps. So how does the mask even work? Well, at least 
[01:59:00]  you're breathing for Pete's sake. Oh, well, he's got a point there. Your tongue is murdering  you, Anthony. It's collapsing. It collapses. It's conspiring against you. How does it collapse?  It just kind of lolls back. You know, the tongue was told to stand down. You must push your,  because the tongue's not on your side, Bubba. Sounds like a conspiracy. Yes. It violated 
[01:59:30]  the most basic protection things a tongue can do. It collapsed on top of the throat and  murders people. Reggie wants tongue as a murderer. I also have a very good idea for drivers where  you could take a hose and allow the exhaust to blow into your nose directly. Oh, Ted, now  you know, Ted, come on. You know that's carbon monoxide. I don't know. I've given quite a few  of those machines out. Nobody has called to tell me how they liked it. Bunch of ingrates.  They're probably all snoozing. Well, you never get calls from happy people, so I guess they're 
[02:00:00]  doing good. That's a great point. And the whole fishbowl thing, what happens is sometimes the jet  engine blows dust into their skull swelling, so people can't get it out, so they have to break it.  You have to break your fishbowl every morning. Yes, you do. Are you expecting to make money off this  idea? I certainly am, Gregory. It sounds crazy. All I've got to do is sell 300 of them, and I'm  rolling in the dough. Rolling in the dough. So that's, what is it, Ted's? Ted's sleep apnea mask 
[02:00:30]  emporium, Anthony. And what do you sell? Sleep apnea masks and apparatuses.  All right. And then there's the one where you could just duct tape it over your nose and  mouth, because those straps are so uncomfortable. Well, I think that would cause a lot of breakouts  and stuff. Yes, that's an excellent observation, because I offered the strapless mask, and people  really wanted it. So I'm like, here, just tape this on your face. Tape not included. That 
[02:01:00]  sounds like a bait and switch to me. That's a good point. That's what the lawyers are calling  that. The jet engine's very loud. Yeah, it's very loud. It just blows air directly into  the fishbowl, which your head is in, and you're on a pillow. That doesn't sound very well thought  out at all. I've been told it's uncomfortable. I certainly won't use it. And what about fuel?  Like, how do you fuel a jet engine like that? It's got to be, it's not very cost effective.  Well, I guess you're going to have to go to Ted's portable gas pump emporium and buy yourself 
[02:01:30]  a little gas pump. Well, you need jet fuel for that. Yes, you do, Anthony. Not easy to  get, Ted. Very difficult, Gregory. You'd be surprised. How much money have you lost on  this idea so far? So far, I'm down 2.5 million in research and lawsuits. Because people are  going blind when their life partner breaks the fishbowl in their head because they're  suffocating. I think it would be hard to get zoning for a jet engine. Very difficult, yes.  I never thought of any of these things. But I figure there's a lot of plane crashes and 
[02:02:00]  things. Just let me have those engines. I'll save you the trouble.  And how safe could it be to have a turbine winding in your yard like that with an animal?  Yes, you'd be surprised how angry people get when their infants are missing. Because  they tend to jam the engine. They get curious. Oh, mama, look, air. No, stay away from that.  Mama, mama. Mama, giant swirly thing. Yes. Could, yeah, definitely. Yes, and then there's 
[02:02:30]  a scream and a loud clunk and a splatter against the wall. And darn it, you're going to be up  for weeks not sleeping and gasping and grieving. You might want to baby-proof that shit.  That's a great point. I probably should. Maybe put a fence around that tent. Well, I had a warning  sign posted. If you're under the age of two, stay away. Oh, that's got to work, man. Thank  you very much, Gregory. Yeah, very good. Another emporium that's going to not do well, Ted. So  far, the financial aspects are not as I'd hoped. I figured I'd sell these things and be rolling 
[02:03:00]  in glory. Roll? What's your stock up to? What is the emporium stock up to? Well, the share  is worth $4 million, but I only have one and I own it. One share. Yes, my portfolio's  not good. $4 million. Yes. One share. I invested a lot of money in soybean hats. Why soybean hats?  Can I figure they're delicious? You can wear a hat, stay dry, and then have lunch. That  was the tagline. Right. Oh, my God. Oh, Ted never learns. No, he learns. Another bad idea. 
[02:03:30]  Not yet. Yet another horrible idea. I just checked my Twitter. I didn't realize I said  sweaty hands in front of Jim Abbott. They're killing me for that. Oh, you did? Well, because  Norton was setting up the whole waiting on line thing, and I'm like, yeah, you get closer  and you have sweaty hands. Oh, no. Everybody was very conscious of the hand thing. He reaches  out with his left hand, I noticed. Yeah. Because I went for the... I didn't actually move my 
[02:04:00]  right hand for the shake, but that thought went in my head, like I want to now shake the  man's hand. Yeah, I don't know what to do. But I didn't make the actual movement, and I  think he feels that all the time, so he quickly put his left out. Oh, see, I just didn't shake.  I felt bad. I want to give him the right-handed shake. Why not? I don't care. Do you care?  Grab that. Yeah, grab it. Give him a shake. Hey, how you doing? And then some asshole  goes, how do you not ask Jim Abbott if he's ever fucked a girl with that hand? How do 
[02:04:30]  you not ask him that? How do you not ask? Brilliant. How do you not ask that? Really? Because we  read the room, and he was a really cool guy. You don't say that. What an idiot. This guy  was passionate. How do you not? I like to see you ask him, asshole. Yeah. You ask him, fudging  nerds. The guy gave us a lot. It was a different type of interview for us, that's all. We go 
[02:05:00]  in a lot of different directions here. I thought he was a very nice gentleman. Yeah. Gentleman.  Why was the camera crew there? Oh, because I tweeted a picture of Jim Norton and Jim Abbott.  I think they're doing some kind of piece on Jim Abbott that they're going to put up on  the screen at Yankee Stadium. That's what the camera crew is here for. What's the whole Yankee  Stadium thing? What's that angle? Well, they're doing a story on me, and they just want to  see different people I talk to. Oh, very cool. Oh, wow.  I was making sure I had my Yankee shirt on, and it was opened up so that the camera guys 
[02:05:30]  saw that and put me up on the big screen at the stadium. Perfect. I got a fucking shirt  on here. Yankees. Yankees. Eric in Jersey. It's too late now, Eric, but you saw Jim Abbott  pitch in 1987 in college? 87. I was a junior at Fordham. My brother was a senior. He was on  Fordham's baseball team, and they made the NCAA baseball playoffs. It was down at Georgia Tech. We  flew down, and on the plane, I read this story. It's illustrated about this Jim Abbott, this amazing 
[02:06:00]  guy.  A little bit more biographical info on you.  So where'd you move to next? Dollsville? Yeah. What happened to you? Well, well, you  know, I was going to go to school, but I couldn't get in there, so I went to Fordham. How much  biographical information do we need, sir? Oh, God. Fucking, what a dullard. He's probably  still talking, and you know, we hit a little turbulence, and we're on our way down to playing.  Well, he meant well. 
[02:06:30]  What I hate about that is it could have been the most amazing story. We'll never know now.  I know. It could have been, and then fucking Jim Abbott skewered two girls through their  vaginas and anuses, and we missed it.  Hey, Brock Lesnar came back to wrestling, huh? We try not to do a lot of wrestling on  our show, but the fact is, that's a huge deal, man. He was a monster in the UFC, and now he's  moving back to the WWE.  It's just better for his health, I think. That's all. His body just, UFC is rough, man. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, like UFC, they will specifically target his injured parts.  They'll be careful with him. Whereas in professional wrestling, they will specifically avoid.  Why would they avoid it to try to win the match, Sam? That's stupid.  Yeah, Sam, what are you talking about? Are you saying it's all fake?  Well, you see, the match would be choreographed so that he would win without having that.  Hold on, is that the hold on, Brods? It's Wilson Phillips. I'm looking at it.  Is that the hold on, Brods? What year is this? Yes. Oh, she's all fat again.  Uh-oh, they're doing Mama's and the Papa's song. Monday, Monday. 
[02:07:30]  She's a good dancer. They're fat arms.  Let's see her. What else you got there? Charna Phillips?  All the leaves are brown. And the sky is green.  And the sky is green. I've been for a while.  On a winter's day. This is lip-sync, by the way.  Is it? Yeah.  And if I didn't tell us, I could leave today. 
[02:08:00]  I could leave today.  California dreamin'.  That's horrible.  On such a winter's day.  California dreamin'.  On such a winter's day.  California dreamin'.  On such a winter's day.  You can hear this version in any bar in America.  It's just there.  Oh, boy.  It's like somebody's over here enjoying it.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing? 
[02:08:30]  What are you doing?  That's terrible.  You're doing a little bit of dancing with you.  That was so fun.  You're pretending like we sound just like the exact parents.  Oh, Sarah Palin.  Sarah Palin.  Sarah Palin.  I thought it was got down on my knees and I began to pray.  It's pretend to pray.  Pretend.  Oh.  I had no idea until I heard you just say that.  That's so fun.  Oh, man.  Get it to the bottom of everything.  Great job.  Thank you.  Oh, Palin looks good.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind giving her the old, you know.  She's got tight pants on right now. 
[02:09:00]  Tight pants.  Did you see the movie on her?  Did you like it?  I don't do that political shit.  So that's just the movie.  No, I hear the movie's good.  Yeah.  And it made her look kind of annoying, but it didn't make her look like it just showed  how unprepared she was.  And look, it comes from the guy who fucking ran McCain's campaign told the story.  Did we get deja vu?  We mentioned it yesterday.  Okay.  I wasn't sure if that was a deja vu thing or if we did talk about it yesterday.  The Oprah's admitting that she would have done things differently. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It's her network.  With own.  Yeah, right?  What the fuck are you doing, bitch?  Worth playing the clip or not?  I don't care.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm just trying to find shit that we can talk about.  You want to do this or not?  Yeah, I know.  I'm like, ha, ha, ha.  I got stupid allergy shit, too.  My lungs are so goddamn heavy right now.  Heavy lungs?  That's good for that.  You're not going to like it.  I'll take you inside the show a little bit.  Fucking Jimmy's killing with the Ted character.  Normally, I would laugh pretty hard there because I love that character. 
[02:10:00]  What's the laugh today?  Which character do you like?  I loved it, Ted.  Boy, do I love Ted.  Better than Josh?  I don't mind Josh either.  Good naturedly.  Josh is fun.  I don't mind Josh.  Josh is a fun guy.  Yeah, he sure is.  You don't like him?  He's the worst of all the characters.  I don't mind Edgar.  I actually enjoy Edgar, too.  How come you don't like Josh?  Because he's a creep.  He constantly touches me and gets in my personal space, and he doesn't say anything.  Ha, ha.  No, he's not laughing at anything.  He's just a wife at a party. 
[02:10:30]  No, he's not.  Nobody would be entertained by him at any point.  Ah, when we get to that pool.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  See, you can't like him anymore.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right, I'm starting to dislike that character now.  You gotta wear a jersey or something.  Yeah, he touches and tickles everyone.  As that character, you need a jersey, I think.  Pat fucking Duffy, no G in the fucking part, on Twitter.  He goes, the Yankee home opener is next week.  Maybe he's throwing out the first pitch.  So they'll throw a little thing on the scoreboard.  Oh.  But why would he throw out the first pitch 20 years ago? 
[02:11:00]  19 years ago was the no hitter, not 20.  Because he has a book.  So maybe they're like, can we time it with the book when he throws out the first pitch?  Why wouldn't he have the book come out as part of the 20th anniversary?  I don't think he's going to, throw out the first pitch.  Maybe he's throwing out a first pitch that week.  Or maybe he's just promoting it now because baseball's opening day.  Right.  And he used to play for the Yankees.  Oh, oh, Brock Lesnar comes back last night.  Yes.  So let's make this quick, Sam.  And painless, please. 
[02:11:30]  It's your show.  That's why I'm saying let's make it quick.  But you're asking me.  I'm saying let's make it quick.  Heck, I don't know anything about this.  So you're going to explain it.  So I'm like, please make it quick.  That's logical.  I didn't watch last night.  I have no idea what happened.  Fudge, yeah.  Fudge, yeah.  I see John Cena in the ring, obviously, because the clip's on pause.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I mean by make it quick.  Can we hear it?  You betcha.  Well, what happened, though?  John Cena lost to The Rock at WrestleMania.  Oh, boy.  So he was calling out.  Not calling out, but he wanted The Rock to come out.  So he congratulated him face to face. 
[02:12:00]  And obviously, The Rock is not even close to the venue.  He's back making movies.  No, The Rock was there last night.  He was there last night.  No, he wasn't.  He started the show with a promo.  Did John Cena want to congratulate him, you think?  I think so.  Probably not.  That's what he said.  This is how it went down as far as Brock coming back.  No surprise to any wrestling fans, by the way, right?  No, but still a thrill.  Okay.  Congratulate him on his victory.  So he's waiting for The Rock.  Yeah, he's waiting. 
[02:12:30]  He's waiting for The Rock.  Oh, maybe he's waiting for someone to come out and do some wrestling.  Waiting.  Oh, shit, no.  Listen to that crack.  Oh, shit.  What?  Listen to that crack.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Rock is back, says the sign.  Oh, man.  Wait a minute.  That's not the right guy.  There's a whole other guy there.  Why?  Where was The Rock? 
[02:13:00]  How did he not notice what's happening?  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Brock Lesnar.  Oh, my.  Oh, shit.  The former WWE Champion.  How about UFC Champion?  Yeah, maybe.  How about you throw that in there?  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive for him.  Why would they mention that?  Only 313 views.  WWE show.  It's more impressive.  Let's say UFC champ.  And American Airlines Arena has come unglued.  Unglued? 
[02:13:30]  It's fine.  Better get some helmets or something.  Yeah, something like that.  Of all the dramatic things I've seen.  Oh, my God.  John Shader knew.  That's what he's getting.  Brock Lesnar.  What?  Holy shit.  Oh, that's nice talk to have in the TV.  Holy shit.  They're getting holy shit here at the American Airlines Arena.  Let's get FCC can play golf.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of this holy shit stuff. 
[02:14:00]  These guys really know how to milk an entrance.  Oh, my God.  He's still fucking coming into the ring.  The moment.  And Sam Fastfall is a little music.  That's a death to Brock Lesnar.  Yeah.  Why are you singing the clapping?  You don't think this is what Brock wants to be doing?  You think he'd rather be in the UFC?  He wants to go where the money is.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's a big fuck.  Oh, shit.  He throws his arms up.  What's going on?  Are they going to duke it out?  Are they going to be fisticuffs? 
[02:14:30]  Is there going to be a Donnybrook?  Are they going to shake it?  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  Look, Cena.  Why did he pick him up?  Why is he picking up John Cena and slamming him?  Why did he do that?  Cena was applauding him.  He doesn't have a problem with Cena.  Sam, help me.  Why?  He wants to make an impact.  Oh, man.  Do you think he's going to be in contention for the championship?  I don't care. 
[02:15:00]  I don't even think he's going to wrestle.  I think he just wanted to throw the man down and say,  no, you take that, you.  That wasn't very nice of him at all.  He was applauding his entrance and being very cordial.  And Brock Lesnar decided to pick him up and smash him on the floor.  Whatever happened to sportsmanship?  I'd love an answer on that.  A good handshake between gentlemen.  Lack of sportsmanship in this sport, I'll say.  I don't enjoy it.  Back when my husband was alive, he never would have stood for that.  It's not my taste.  I'd rather watch my afternoon programs.  Not my cup of tea either.  My stories. 
[02:15:30]  See, I watch my stories, too.  It's General Hospital.  Oh.  And it's not like your stories.  Right.  Do you like your programs?  These are my stories, yeah.  You watch your stories?  These stories, General Hospital.  His story is, let's get somebody sent to the Dawn Hospital.  Oh, please.  When people slamming them on the floor like that, of course they're going to visit the hospital.  The big monster he is, too.  Oh, he is so big and monstrous.  Why 313 views?  Well, this just went up this morning. 
[02:16:00]  Why do you have to kick the man in the head?  You know, back when I was in school, we would always say you don't kick a person when they're down.  You pick them back up.  That's very nice.  Yes.  It was a different time back then.  A different time.  Yeah.  Brock Lesnar probably subscribes to a different viewpoint.  Oh, I don't care for that viewpoint at all.  You don't.  You can keep that viewpoint in your own eyeline.  Thank you very much.  So then what did Brock do?  That was it.  I hope he said he was sorry.  Well, he got up on the ropes.  Did he talk?  Nope.  Got up on the ropes. 
[02:16:30]  He fucking flexed.  End of the show.  What are they setting up, Sam?  Well, they'll do Brock Cena.  For the next year and a half?  No.  Please.  Exactly.  Holy shit.  Please.  The Rock came out last night and said he wants to be WWE champion again.  I'm assuming at some point this year they'll put the belt on Brock Lesnar.  Then The Rock will come back to fight Brock Lesnar at next year's WrestleMania.  Wait.  Isn't fucking...  Who's the champion?  CM Punk.  Oh, CM is the...  Right.  Okay.  Why?  So Brock will probably take the belt off him eventually. 
[02:17:00]  Obama's in wrestling now?  Brock.  Oh, CI.  Why would The Rock come back again?  For the money.  But doesn't he make a lot of money making the movies?  Or did the movie career dry it up a little bit?  No.  I mean, to promote the movies, it's all...  Because, you know, he's all over the place.  He's going to have a Tooth Fairy 2.  But he was gone for a while, Sam.  And now he's starting to come back.  To wrestling, you mean?  Yeah, he was gone a while, right?  Yeah.  I mean, he established himself as a movie star, and now he can use it for publicity.  Who's bigger?  Who would win?  Would they have win?  Brock or Rock? 
[02:17:30]  Brock.  Well, Sam makes a good point.  He did establish himself as a movie star.  Right.  Tooth Fairy was amazing.  It was very successful.  It was?  It made a lot of money.  No, I don't think it did.  I don't think you're checking.  I think you're just making that up, because he looked silly in a tutu.  I don't know anything.  He does look very silly in a tutu.  Was that a hit?  Yeah.  It was a hit.  Stop.  Come on.  I mean, Larry the Cable Guy's Tooth Fairy 2 might not have been as big a hit.  What?  Was he in it?  Larry the Cable Guy did Tooth Fairy 2?  Straight to DVD.  Oh, man.  He doesn't have the draw that Brock has. 
[02:18:00]  That's so weird.  I want to be in a Larry the Cable Guy movie.  How can I not get in one of those?  Exactly.  Just call him.  Hey, Larry.  We got right in.  Larry.  All right.  Come on.  He's looking it up right now.  Tooth Fairy.  Tooth Fairy made $60 million.  $60 million.  It's pretty successful.  It's okay.  That's not successful.  A movie like that, I bet you they want $100 million in the end.  It's a fucking $1 million a ticket.  That's 60 people.  That's all.  That's right, Ed.  It's terrible.  You tell them.  Are you sure?  Terrible.  I mean, I didn't see it.  It could have been. 
[02:18:30]  Well, you could say it was $30 million a ticket until people have seen it.  You could say that, too, Chip.  What about Tooth Fairy 2?  Tooth Fairy 2.  Let's see.  Tooth Fairy.  $1.80.  All right.  Now we're talking.  Oh.  No.  No movie.  No movie are people found.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's not good.  Oh.  Because it wasn't a box office.  Yeah.  Straight to DVD.  Straight to DVD.  Do you want to see the trailer?  Yeah.  Let's see the trailer.  Oh, the trailer for Tooth Fairy 2.  Yeah.  I bet the Tooth Fairy says, get her done.  I didn't even know that this happened. 
[02:19:00]  I didn't either.  Look at all the dislikes on the fucking video.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  It just came out this year.  When did it come out?  It did.  March last month.  Wow.  Did it?  What?  I didn't see one fucking ad for this.  Is that what he wanted to come in to promote?  I would assume yes.  Let's see.  We dodged the book.  Larry, why don't you stop tinkering with your own car and come over here and try to work  on somebody else's?  Larry Guthrie lived a life.  Who's the man?  Without responsibility or direction.  Most of these kids are more mature than you are. 
[02:19:30]  But after today.  Look, I mean, it's for the Tooth Fairy.  Yay.  All that is about to change.  You're in violation of the Tooth Fairy handle.  You didn't think Tooth Fairy's were real, did you?  Now you're one of us.  What up?  I'm a caseworker.  Your caseworker.  He's wearing a Tooth Toe.  I am a Tooth Fairy.  He didn't ask for it.  I'm flying around.  Oh, boy. 
[02:20:00]  I'm expecting it.  He's just falling over everything.  It's like an East Side Dave video.  You're a Tooth Fairy?  I made you powder.  It's a good one.  This is powdered sugar.  But with a little magic, he'll give everyone something to believe in.  That's a kid's movie.  I'll believe that when I see pigs flying.  Larry the Cable got a Tooth Fairy.  It's a pig flying.  Like you made me.  Bert.  It's a good one.  Wow.  Chip was cracking up.  Yeah.  The Tooth Fairy fell down.  I was going nuts.  Well, it is a kid's movie. 
[02:20:30]  You're right.  It was geared toward kids, I guess.  Yeah.  I'm sure you made a couple bucks off of that one.  It was filmed wonderfully.  Larry the Cable Guy.  I like the special effects and stuff.  So The Rock's last movie made $98 million.  The one before that made $200 million.  What was that?  Fast Five.  The one before that made $120 million.  Yeah.  So Tooth Fairy was a bust at $60 million.  $60 million.  It's not that good.  Kids movies are supposed to make a lot of money because kids will go see it fucking eight 
[02:21:00]  times.  Besides that, the parents have to buy the ticket, too.  So a lot of parents go.  They have no choice.  They've got to buy the ticket.  Yeah.  But that's true.  But one parent.  Oh, yeah.  So two parents will take ten kids.  Well, not necessarily.  You see a lot of kids with their father or mother.  The kids movie he did before that, which was the game plan, did $90 million.  Exactly.  Tooth Fairy was a failure.  I mean, it was still successful.  It was just a failure compared to his other grossly successful films.  You can't accept that The Rock could actually fail at something. 
[02:21:30]  What's he fail at?  Maybe Doom.  Tooth Fairy.  Doom wasn't that good.  Other than Doom, I don't think, you know.  What about Southland Tales?  I got one.  I got a movie.  What's that?  Tooth Fairy.  Let's do this all day.  Tooth Fairy.  There's no way it was a failure.  Get me a movie guy on the phone.  $60 million, I think, is considered a failure.  Then why would he be still making giant movies?  Because you're allowed to have a bomb.  You're allowed to have a bomb.  Sandler's had some bombs, and he's Sandler.  Yeah, but he makes the movies himself.  He's got a production company. 
[02:22:00]  He still gets them distributed.  And he got all the Razzies, huh?  The Sandler?  Yeah, he got every single...  Jack and Joe made history by getting every single category.  Did anyone end up seeing that movie?  No, not one person.  Why would Adam do that?  It's almost like you're...  I mean, I guess it makes money, but...  He's out of touch.  A little bit, maybe, yes.  That's why.  You don't need to do that, bro.  That's why.  He's out of touch.  You're a made man.  Someone should have told him, look, dude.  I mean, you're a funny guy.  Are you kidding me?  What?  It's $74 million, you know what?  Jack and Jill made $74 million.  The production budget was $79 million. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, but in foreign...  All right, go back to the Tooth Fairy.  What was the production value on that?  In foreign...  I think $40-something.  All right.  That was a lot of money.  That was a failure.  How much is the production value, though?  No, it wasn't.  It's his salary.  A lot of that...  $20 million, that might be his salary.  Yeah.  So a lot of that might be kind of deceptive.  I can't imagine $74 million worth of people saw Jack and Jill.  Why?  It's an Adam Sandler movie.  That's a guarantee people are going to go see it.  Much foreign.  It's $148 million.  That's a hit.  That was a hit.  He makes money.  That was a fucking hit. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, God.  What does Rotten Tomatoes give it?  Oh, God.  How bad?  That would be the worst thing ever.  Sure.  Come on now.  You know, but...  Rotten Tomatoes.  Rotten Tomatoes.  Rotten Tomatoes.  You want to get tomato face?  Holy shit.  God, are you kidding me?  $74 million.  You don't think it was worth it?  Who would go to see that?  At a million dollars a ticket, that's only 74 people.  True.  That's true.  All right.  You got me.  3% on Rotten Tomatoes.  3%!  And 38% of the audience. 
[02:23:30]  That's not even good.  I liked it.  It was funny.  Shut up.  It wasn't.  That's not even good.  A little over one out of three liked the movie.  Wow.  That's way too high, I think.  I'd give it a good review.  Let me say hi to Noel in Massachusetts.  He's been waiting for at least three minutes.  Oh.  Noel.  Hey, Opie.  Hey.  Hey, last night.  A guy from the show made his debut.  At wrestling?  Yeah, I can't believe that.  At Monday Night Raw, one of the guys from the show was there. 
[02:24:00]  He broke a leg.  He came in as Lord Tensai.  When he took off the mask, I couldn't believe it.  It was Bob fucking Kelly.  Does he look like Bob Kelly, Sam?  He does.  He does?  Yeah, Bob got a lot of tweets.  Why didn't you bring this to our attention, Sam Roberts?  You told me not to keep it brief at the wrestling.  Oh.  Oh, shit.  But that's something maybe we would have been interested in.  Don't you think?  I think so, but you know.  That's Brock Lesnar.  Who's her ass?  Who's her ass? 
[02:24:30]  See, how much bigger is Brock than fucking CM?  Oh, a lot.  He is, right?  That's the answer.  Is that their website?  Yeah.  Boy, they got some fucking nice website there.  All the people.  That's a great website.  You can punch up in alphabetical order.  All the superstars.  I want a website like that.  That is a good goddamn website.  I'm going to send my guide there.  You know, WWE probably pays a pretty penny for a website.  This is the guy.  Oh, my God.  He looks like Bob Kelly.  You can already see that. 
[02:25:00]  He looks like Bob Kelly.  He's got like a black ninja mask on or something.  He's a karate.  We did some research on him.  We understand.  Who is this guy?  Did he wrestle as another dude?  Yeah, he used to wrestle as Prince Albert.  Prince Albert?  Prince Albert in a can?  No, on a cock.  Ah, right.  That's the joke.  He was very pierced.  Oh.  All right.  He's taking off his shit.  Samurai little tape off.  And he's still got the samurai helmet and mask over his face.  I can't see anything. 
[02:25:30]  Let's see.  What's the feeling if he looks at this across the room?  Ha, ha, ha.  That's Bob Kelly.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  He ain't going to let that down.  That's fucking funny.  Dude.  Dude.  I'm going to stay here.  I got all these things written on my face, dude, to remind me like Memento, dude.  Ah, that's fucking great.  It does look like a big, fat-headed Bob Kelly.  God, that guy has got a meaty head.  Yeah, yeah.  That thing is meaty.  You'd have to hit him with a fucking Buick to knock him out. 
[02:26:00]  Probably a dumb question.  Is that a real tattoo, you think?  Not on his face.  No.  No?  Looks like Sharpie.  I don't think it's Sharpie either, but it's not a real tattoo.  Oh.  Yeah, he kind of looks like Kelly.  Do you have to do that every time then when he goes out?  I have to go, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Oh, you go, James.  I'll talk to you guys a little later, hopefully.  See you tomorrow.  You go.  You're leaving us?  I have to, yeah.  Then we leave, too.  No, I don't want to.  Then we leave, too, Sam.  I don't want to shut the whole show down.  He really does. 
[02:26:30]  That's Bob.  You can see Bob doing all these moves.  Dude, you pick him up.  Tending to be a ninja.  You give him the pile driver, dude.  You sniff his asshole.  Ew, he's putting his ass right in his face.  Yeah, dude.  You fall down.  Boom.  You got your app.  He's probably telling the guy while he's got him up in the air.  Dude, I got my app.  Did I show you?  I jailbroke the phone, but I'm putting it back the way it was, dude.  Suplex.  Dude.  Put the elbow in people's face, dude.  Yeah, you fall off the ropes, dude. 
[02:27:00]  Banging around.  Boom.  You got your ropes.  You got your centrifugal force.  Wow, that is...  It looks like him.  That's funny.  A little bit.  Are we going to put that on the Facebook there, Sam Roberts?  Yes.  All right.  Eric's working on it.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We're going to take a break.  We won't leave.  Or will we?  Or will we?  I'm going to lock the door.  You're not going to leave.  Fuck.  You don't have any say over us.  You're not the boss of me.  I'm the boss.  You're not the boss of me. 
[02:27:30]  You're not the boss.  Opie and Anthony are the boss.  You're not the boss of me.  You're not the boss of them.  They're the bosses.  Go away, Chip.  Yeah, why don't you go away?  Fuck you.  Oh, man.  Wow.  That's nice language.  My mother would never tolerate that.  You're not the boss.  I ain't standing for this.  Oh, I'm sick.  Fuck.  Bless you.  Thank you.  I want to get in a fight with Chip one day.  Yeah, why don't you get into a fight with my asshole?  Shut the fuck up.  Yeah, why don't you shut the fuck up?  I would love to see Chip fight. 
[02:28:00]  How would Chip fight?  I claw the eyes.  I'm a sick fucking puppy.  I would imagine he's a dirty fighter.  Oh, he's a sick fucking puppy.  I'm a sick fucking puppy.  I go right for the eyes.  I claw him out.  Is that where you got the name of the band?  Fuck yeah, man.  I fucking claw your eyes right out and they fall on the floor.  He's a tough guy.  I step on him.  What do you call the band on the radio?  Sick effing puppies.  Oh.  All right, Jim.  See you tomorrow.  We're going to take a break.  We'll finish up the show next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:28:30]  We're going to be filming a promo for Jim Norton's comedy special, huh?  Yes, we are.  That is what we're doing today.  We have to go down there and do some witty banter back and forth.  We haven't done...  Some repartee.  We haven't done witty banter back and forth in a while. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  I mean, on the radio we have, but like in front of cameras and stuff.  Ooh.  Huh?  You've been doing it for years.  I sit on the radio, yeah, but not like off air.  This is funny.  Hold on.  I just got to...  Well, you know, my pool was open yesterday.  I saw the fucking pictures.  Yes.  Is it almost full?  Well, yes, it is.  And that's my concern.  That's my concern is...  Why is there a concern?  Well, because I don't want it to overflow. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, it's still filling up right now?  It's still filling up.  I have it on camera.  So it's filling up faster than they thought?  Yeah.  I could watch it, though.  I know exactly where it is.  It's fine.  Because Ange is going there.  And she just put a great question forth to me on my messages, which I think is something  that somebody writes as a question when you really don't think it out for three seconds.  Okay.  I said, yeah, to turn the water off if it's up.  She goes, okay, where's the shutoff for the water? 
[02:30:00]  Uh-oh.  I just put, at the other end of the hose.  Oh, okay.  It's like, see, if you follow the hose from the end that the water's coming out of, there's  usually a valve that shuts the water off.  And I said, uh-oh, because I look like an asshole.  But I'm thinking, I mean, you've got a big house and stuff.  I don't know if there's some special thing in the fucking basement.  Nah, it's a fucking hose.  It just goes into the pool.  In the end, it's just a hose.  It's just a hose that goes in the pool.  So it's time to shut off the water.  Now, when can you actually jump in it? 
[02:30:30]  Because you're going to heat it up, obviously.  Uh, well, yeah, yeah.  Well, they've got to fill it up, obviously, there.  Could it be ready to go this weekend?  Between the chemicals and cleaning, what day is it?  Tuesday?  It could be.  It could be.  At least, put it this way, at least the jacuzzi is good for jacuzziing.  I could turn the heat on and really get that thing bubbling hot.  The rest of the pool, though, probably be a little chilly for about maybe a week or so 
[02:31:00]  until I can build that temperature up.  So you're going to be in the jacuzzi this weekend, for sure.  That does seem to be the, uh, and there's Ange laughing.  Ha ha, Ange, that was a silly question.  Uh, yeah, I'll probably be in the jacuzzi, relaxing, a little wine, uh, play some, I got  the Sonos system.  We blast out some fucking Sirius XM's lithium out the fucking speakers, and I will be a  chilling, niggies.  That's what I do, motherfuckers.  So basically, you're going to be throwing out the first sperm this weekend. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, throwing out the first.  Well, I mean, it's, you know, baseball's in the air, and so is sperm.  The sperm will be a-flyin'.  Well, it's, I think it's a little chilly for any, uh, spermatozoa, uh, out of doors.  It's still, you know, 63 degrees, and then if you do it at night, it'll be even colder.  Oh, it'll be colder.  But you know what?  When you're in that fucking jacuzzi, and that thing's bubbling, and the steam's going,  ah, it doesn't matter how cold it is.  I used to, I forgot what mountain it was when I was skiing a lot.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to get back into skiing this winter, but they basically never got snow. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, some of the places, I'm exaggerating, but it was a horrible year for the resorts.  Yeah.  But I used to go to this one mountain where, uh, yeah, you jump in the jacuzzi, man.  You run.  You run in the snow.  It's like fucking 10, 15 degrees out.  You jump in that hot jacuzzi for a little while.  It was awesome.  I did that up in Aspen one year, in Aspen, and, uh, just sitting there puffing on the  big cigars, and, and you got a big fucking glass of wine, and, ah, you got your wine, 
[02:32:30]  you got your jacuzzi, your snow, boom.  By the time you make it back to the condo, though, your hair is literally frozen.  Like, it's, it's cracky ice frozen.  That's why I don't believe in that cold shit, because you didn't get a cold from that, right?  No, no, no.  Hey, uh, do you remember when we were in, uh, I think it was Maine skiing for AF?  Oh, yes.  Sunday Mountain.  And they had a heated...  Or Sunday River.  Sunday River, which is a nightmare to get to, but when you do get there, it's a good time.  Uh, didn't they have a really, uh, over-the-top heated pool?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not just a heated pool, but it was like a hundred and something. 
[02:33:00]  It was almost like a jacuzzi.  It was fucking blazing hot.  It was almost like a jacuzzi, and an asshole Crazy Jim wanted to try to get us all naked.  What was that about?  Well, I think Jim had an agenda at times.  You think?  I haven't talked about Crazy Jim in a while.  A great sales guy up there in Boston, but he was also a nutcase.  And I think there were a few, uh, of the ladies that were more than willing to go skinny dipping.  Ladies!  But then Crazy Jim wanted to bring it over the top and have everyone naked.  Everyone naked, and, uh, he was just, uh, kind of liked that whole thing, debauchery. 
[02:33:30]  He loved, uh, pulling his dick out.  Yeah, yeah.  Pulled his dick out a lot.  Loved pulling his cock out.  I think I got about another foot or a foot and a half of water to go in.  Yeah, but that's quick.  Yeah, it is very fast.  Fast, fast fill.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, the chemicals, then the guy's got to come and vac all the leaves out and stuff.  Some get through, uh, in between where the cover is and everything.  Sure.  And, uh, and then, man, summer officially starts.  That's the beginning of summer when the pool opens.  I don't give a shit what's the temperature is. 
[02:34:00]  When's the estimated time for the beginning of summer party?  First party?  I usually do it on, um, Memorial Day weekend.  Mm-hmm.  But since the pool's open, I think a pre-party is in order, right?  That sounds good to me.  Because Memorial Day weekend's still pretty far off.  Yeah.  So, you know, it might have to be short notice.  You know, you might have to be on, on standby for a party, because it'll be like, all right,  the first nice weather weekend, and you don't really know if Friday or Saturday night's going 
[02:34:30]  to be good until maybe Wednesday.  Gotcha.  Definitely.  So, on a Wednesday, I could hear like, oh, this weekend's going to be 80 degrees.  Boom!  Yeah.  Put out the fucking alert.  It'll be obvious.  You have to go with the alert.  Oh, yeah.  Gotta go with the alert.  Kansas planet.  Yeah, like you said, it's so obvious that first fucking beautiful weekend.  Indeed.  I can't wait.  I'm trying to get a, a summer house this summer.  Oh, where?  Out in the Hamptons?  Maybe I should use the airwaves.  Nah!  Gotta go Jersey Shore, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Seaside Heights. 
[02:35:00]  Where?  No, I'm not going where the Jersey Shore people are.  Why?  I'm at the shirt store.  I need like, I need kind of like a town that's like, uh, geared toward family, but not too  fuddy-duddy, has a little edge to it, but not too crazy.  Oh, boy.  Couple clubs.  Couple clubs.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,  look, you got a nice house, I'll fucking rent it this summer.  I'll use these airwaves right the fuck now, I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  You would rent from a fan?  Sure, why not?  Oh, man.  It's not a fucking freak.  They'd install cameras. 
[02:35:30]  That's exactly going to be weird.  Here's fucking, oh, here's Opie, here it is, he's wiping the fucking rim with his sock,  check it out!  He does put his bald bag up on the fucking bathroom sink.  It's on my fucking sink, it's great.  His friends would be driving by the house at night.  All right, maybe that's not good.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,  all the fucking hands.  Yeah!  I stepped inside a tournament.  Whoa, whoa!  Ow, ow, ow, ow, I got these hundreds screaming out.  Yeah!  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, yo. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my God.  You gonna have a journey to short parties?  If you listen to this shit outside of club, you're gay.  No.  You have to be.  You can listen to this in your car.  Like, if I'm in a bar or club and this comes on, right on, I'm in.  You don't listen to this in your car?  Why would you?  That's weird.  That's when it gets weird, I think.  I listen to LMFAO in my car all the time.  But that might be different, no?  No, it's the same shit.  Same shit?  All right, then I'm wrong, Sam.  What can I tell you?  Oh, I don't know.  I just throw this shit out there and see if it sticks or not.  I don't know.  We could have a difference of opinion.  I'm sexy and not no way. 
[02:36:30]  That's right.  I'm sexy and not no way.  I don't feel sexy today, though.  Why?  I'm sexy and not no way.  It's all in the mind.  I'm downplaying my sickness.  Because I know it's a drag when I bring it up.  But the allergies are getting me, I think.  I had a sore throat.  Now I've got the heavy chest.  I'm going to laugh at the Ted bit.  I wanted to because it was hilarious.  What?  Oh, I'm sexy and I know it.  I'm sexy and I know it.  You want some of my bass for your voice today, Sam? 
[02:37:00]  I got a little extra today.  Yeah.  People say you have no bass in your voice.  Yeah, you really don't.  I got a little extra today.  You want to borrow a little bit?  I'd like to.  A squeaky little kid voice.  Bring it down.  Bring it down.  Give me some bass.  Oh, yeah.  What do you want me to say?  Say it's forced with you.  Yeah, it's what I'm saying.  You told me to give it to you.  You know, I'm sexy and I know it.  See, that was natural.  I'm sexy and I know it.  Very bassy right there.  That's not my voice.  I got a little extra bass today.  It's driving the ladies nuts.  Love it.  I'm sexy and I know it.  Oh, shit. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, shit.  You can listen to this song anywhere.  Look at Bradley Beach near Belmar and Asbury Park.  That's far, though, man.  Hey, can you help me give it a house?  Fuck the radio show.  Here's the wiggle part.  Let me look down.  You got a house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You love this shit, right?  Douche Nozzle checking in.  He brings back something from the old days. 
[02:38:00]  He says, ecstasy dad is laughing at you all.  Ecstasy dad.  Remember ecstasy dad?  Oh, man.  That's the way back machine.  I've got all about it.  I'm sexy and I know it.  Oh, my God.  And please don't fist bump.  I'm fist bumping on camera.  People are very upset with my dancing on camera.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  I got my hands up and, yeah, I'm raising the roof.  I'm sexy and I know it. 
[02:38:30]  I'm a dork.  No.  It's all mental.  Is it mental?  Yeah.  I just don't care.  That is good.  I don't care.  Apparently.  I obviously don't care.  I know it.  Whose house am I renting?  Oh, I got a house roping in upstate New York.  Upstate New York?  Dude, Brewers.  What kind of partying is going on up there?  Last time I hung with Brewer, he almost talked me into a lake house.  Fucking lake house?  But that's not a party.  Lake house you could use all year long.  Excuse me. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, but.  You could do a little skiing, a little golf, a little boating.  You're not hearing this music at a lake house.  You're hearing do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do.  And by the way, E-Rock is a better DJ than Troy.  Fucking it, right?  Yeah.  E-Rock's spinning some fucking tunes for us.  You know what, E-Rock?  You're the official DJ to the end of the show.  Yeah.  Keep the fucking music going.  Keep the tunes going.  Please, E-Rock.  Fucking like this place up.  That's right.  And you don't have to play the whole song.  When you feel like you want to change up the song, then you do that.  Oh, God, the people that are taking over of Sirius XM. 
[02:39:30]  Hi, guys.  Oh, hi, guys.  How you doing, guys?  There's rumors in the air.  The guy's taking over the company.  That's our new fucking bosses, dude.  Got to dance.  Oh, my God, there's rumors, and we know it.  Oh, look, they're looking in every window with suits.  Oh, that's never good.  They waved.  At least we made an impression.  They're taking notes.  Yeah, they are taking notes.  They're assessing the value of each show.  This show has to go.  Obviously, if they have time to wave to us, they're not doing anything of any import.  That's okay.  I'm ready.  I'm ready for what's next. 
[02:40:00]  Whatever it is.  Whatever.  I'm ready.  Oh, man, they're looking in the big engineering room there.  That's going to go.  Oh, that fucking Bart Simpson thing that's been in there?  That's going to go.  Can you go ask them if they're taking over the company?  Oh, my God, no.  Nope.  Why not?  Because you guys are going to be gone, and I'm going to be asking those guys for a job.  You want to get a lake house?  No.  Why?  It's not a party.  There's no party up there.  Where's the party at?  It's Opie.  He said he's going crazy up there by the lake. 
[02:40:30]  First time I ever went swimming in a lake, I sunk like a motherfucker.  Did you?  Someone has to fucking let you know about that shit.  Oh, that is fresh water.  Fresh water?  You've got to swim a little harder.  Yeah, you don't have as much buoyancy.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, I went there to Lake Roncon come on.  It was like, ow.  Yeah.  I've got to swim.  You don't realize how much more you've got to swim.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Yeah, boy, they're making the rounds already.  Look at those suits.  There is a gaggle of suits.  Aw, Don Wicklund.  Donnie Wicklund, bitches.  Right here to the party. 
[02:41:00]  No, it would be great.  Danny Donnie Wicklund.  We're out of no, sir.  No, it would be great.  Don Wicklund becomes our new boss and fires our asses.  Don, what's going on?  What do you know about the rumors, Don?  Don Wicklund.  Here it is.  Don Wicklund.  Yeah, bitches.  We win.  We're in the middle of the opening Anthony Club right now.  Yeah, it's the club.  E-Rock is the DJ until 10 o'clock.  E-Rock spins some tunes.  If you've got any requests, let us know.  We're just keeping things up here.  Yeah, motherfuckers.  That's right, motherfuckers.  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  You haven't fist bumped yet, Don.  Show's changed a bit, Don.  Give us a fist bump.  He doesn't want to talk.  We're going after the gay audience.  Where are you going?  Donnie.  Donnie Wicklund.  He's not saying a word.  Ah, even Donnie Wicklund.  He's one of the Illuminati with XM.  Yeah, he is.  You know what?  One of the few survivors from XM, so I don't know what the fuck he's got on these people.  Yo, bro, put this in the website, because you know what?  I might go so to spay this year.  What up, brah?  Because I'm taking a lot of time off this summer.  Fuck this place.  Yeah?  How much?  I'm going to take at least, I don't know. 
[02:42:00]  I'm going to try to squeeze a month off in the summer.  The hook on this song is sick.  Because it's at the end of our contract, so it don't matter.  Put this in the website there.  I'm telling you the truth.  We're playing club music, and we're going to get me a summer house before 10 o'clock.  Put this in.  Hook on this is sick.  Who is this?  Flo Rida.  With Rihanna?  That's not Rihanna.  Some of you sounds like Rihanna.  I need the backslash.  Backslash.  Hang on. 
[02:42:30]  Leave it up.  Okay.  I want to buy a house, but I'm going to rent this summer.  Oh.  And I ain't going Hamptons.  You got a bigger house on the Jersey Shore for the same money.  Rolling.  Rolling.  Come on.  Rolling.  Rolling.  Rolling.  We're clobbing.  We're clobbing.  Rolling.  Rolling.  Come on.  Rolling.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Look at that house, Ant.  Whoa.  That's nice.  That's on Sotus Bay.  Where's that? 
[02:43:00]  Where my boy Wheeze has a house.  It's in Roger.  Get down.  You got to party.  I know exactly where that house is.  We drove by that when we were whining.  You're sacrificing a lot of partying, though.  Why?  Because that's not going to be a party.  That's going to be relaxation.  Yeah.  You got to party, baby.  It's a party this summer.  There's some little trip and die.  What?  I like Sotus Bay, though.  My house is going to be a sick fucking scene this summer.  You need something that's like, you know, some party to it, but a nice homey atmosphere.  Danielle.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Real estate agent?  No.  I'm actually the homeowner.  Homeowner?  It's a lake that's across from a lake where Derek Jeter's house is.  Oh, you might have heard of a man named Derek Jeter.  Wait, you got a house on a lake?  Yeah.  And it's great for kids.  But look, it's right near Warwick Winery.  You're right down from the pumpkin picking in the apple stuff.  Oh, crap.  If you ain't here to party, get your broke ass home.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Dude, you could totally wind it up. 
[02:44:00]  Wind it up.  Wind it up.  Get the fuck out of here.  She made that up.  Yeah, nobody whines it up.  No one whines it up.  How far is the lake from New York City?  I like that, though.  Wind it up.  Wind it up.  Wind it up.  Wind it up.  And you just get wine glasses.  I said, stub your yapping, bitch.  Get some cops.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I'm trying to get a summer house.  I'm fist bumping.  If it's not in Jersey, it's not a summer house.  Damn it.  See, I told you this song was sick, bro. 
[02:44:30]  Sick.  Fucking sick.  I need a house.  You serious?  Hit me up on Twitter, OP Radio.  I know that was a cheap plug, but I got to get a summer house.  Got to.  People saying Bradley Beach is the way to go.  Got to get a summer house, Yos.  Bradley Beach.  Bradley Beach.  I'm throwing that town out there to fool some people.  Are you throwing them off the path?  I think so.  Is that what you're doing?  All right. 
[02:45:00]  Why didn't Don Wicklin want to talk to us?  He's not down to party.  Dandy Don Wicklin is so on the inside.  I built that bridge.  I rebuilt that bridge, Sam.  You never burned it down.  Don Wicklin?  You don't think I'd burn that down?  He loved you.  What?  You could do whatever you wanted to that guy.  He was in love with you.  Yeah, I think he was.  I think literally.  I'm being honest.  I think he was.  Yeah, for sure.  Remember when he went shopping with us for clothes?  He really wanted to see how those jeans looked.  Oh, and the dressing room. 
[02:45:30]  Are you sure you don't want me to come in there and make sure they're the right fit?  Yeah.  No, I'm all right, Donnie.  You're all right?  I'm all right, Donnie.  You're all right there?  All right.  People putting disco balls up in Pal Talk.  I like it.  It's nice.  LBI is on my list.  Thank you, Matt.  Long Beach Island, New Jersey.  That's on my list, Dan.  That's where all the money is.  Money.  I'm going to rent for a couple months.  But not the nagle fortune.  The nagle fortune.  I could be in a house right now.  Fuck.  The season started. 
[02:46:00]  You know that?  Holy shit.  Yeah, I know.  The rental season started.  The season started a while ago.  October is the season.  You got to get in there.  Make it feel right, baby.  Lake George is too far away, asshole.  I want like an hour, hour and a half drive tops.  With a party.  To get to my summer house.  Thousand islands.  That's too far, Joe.  Help me out here.  Well, I have to do fucking hundreds islands.  Tonight.  Let me go to Joe in Jersey. 
[02:46:30]  Joe.  Joe.  Hey, what up?  So listen, Bradley Beach shithole.  Down the street from like fucking crack asses.  But why is everyone saying it's so beautiful there?  Because they want to get you to be there.  So that's at least one decent person with money there, I guess.  Oh, fuck.  Mattoquan.  Mattoquan's the way to go, baby.  Where?  Mattoquan.  Where the hell is that?  Mattoquan?  Mattoquan?  Huh?  Hey!

We know we might not get tomorrow. 
[02:48:00]  Let's do it tonight.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Let's do it tonight.  Yeah!  Hold on.  I'm being told that Mattisquan doesn't have a boardwalk.  What?  We need a fucking boardwalk!  We need a fucking party!  We need a fucking party!  I need a fucking party!  Yeah!  Boardwalk for my summer house!  Yo!  Yeah!  Yes, people rule! 
[02:48:30]  Great!  This reminds me of my BAB days where they forced me to go into clubs like this.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then they would introduce me and no one gave a shit.  I'm like, I would beg the DJ, please don't fucking introduce me.  Let's make a deal right now because no one gives a fuck.  Ladies and gentlemen, coming out now, it's Greg Opie-Hugh.  Oh, shit!  And then I had to throw t-shirts and then I would get the fuck out of there.  Did you have to say BAB was your summer party station?  Yeah, I did.  It's the home of rock and roll, bitch. 
[02:49:00]  I did.  Yeah!  How am I going to get a house?  None of your kind.  Yeah!  How am I going to get a house?  I just want to play like Seattle.  Like where the elite go?  Am I elite, though?  Of course you are.  Nice.  You're fucking helping.  Nice.  I like being elite.  Wait till this beat kicks in.  Nice.  It's going to be sick, dude.  I'm trying to have a conversation. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah!  Where's this Bayhead shit?  Bayhead, Lavalette, where the fuck am I going?  Club Sonic Denny in the house! 
[02:50:00]  Ah, yeah!  Welcome to the club, Ken.  Yeah!  Welcome to the club.  We hit, we hit a...  Where is it?  Yeah!  Oh, shit!  Oh, yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah!  Yeah, mother fucker! 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, we're in Europe, bitches!  Yeah!  Oh, shit!  This is my shit!  Looks like I'm going to Spring Lake, everyone.  Woo!  What state is that in?  I got Spring Lake, I think.  What state is that in?  Jersey?  Jersey!  Jersey!  Yes! 
[02:51:00]  Jersey!  Jersey, bitches!  Jersey, what?  Yeah!  Can I rent the Jersey Shore House?  Do they rent that every summer?  They do.  I want to kick whoever the fuck out who has it.  They rent it.  It's expensive.  It is, huh?  Cape Cod.  I would love to go to Cape Cod.  Cape Cod's not a party.  I've been to Cape Cod.  There's no party in there.  I want to chill out this summer.  Where am I going?  Ain't no party there.  Felt like Kevin Bacon in Footloose when I went there.  Where am I going?  Oh, shit! 
[02:51:30]  All right, well.  Yeah!  Turn it up, B-Rock.  It's the breakdown.  Oh, yeah.  All right, come on.  Get my Matrix onto this shit.  Oh, fuck!  Yeah, what's that?  I don't even know.  Here comes the foam.  Yeah!  Whoa!  Look at this shit!  Oh, man!  Didn't we have a girl crack her skull in the foam one year?  That was great.  Wasn't Spaz involved?  Oh, yeah.  He was in the foam, and then...  Did he crack his skull? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, I think he fell down, too.  When are we going to do a club gig for the show?  Oh, we really need to.  Yeah.  Wasn't that the gig where our girls were on the side of the stage with their arms folded  in disgust?  Oh, wait a minute.  That was every gig.  That was every gig.  Turn up the music!  Yeah!  What the fucker!  I missed out on a lot of time!  Yeah!  Clapping over the head.  That's the shit.  I like that.  Yeah!  That's the shit.  Nothing worse than a girl putting an asparagus up her asshole, and then you look to the side 
[02:52:30]  of the stage, because you're having a blast, and you see your girl with her arms folded  scowling at you.  What the fuck is going on?  What do you think pays for everything?  Asparagus up the asshole!  Exactly.  Figure it out!  Well, I really didn't think I'd enjoy a dance party opening at any show.  This show is the best show ever!  This is a dance!  Oh, shit!  That's that funny!  I like this one.  Beat that beat up. 
[02:53:00]  I ain't gonna watch this shitty show, but I like this song.  Beat that beat up.  Yeah, come on!  Oh, wait.  Building bridges.  One at a time.  Paulie D. show rules.

[02:53:30]  It's a five-o!  I got a few towns, but now I need a few houses to look at.  What do I do?  Do I take a ride down there and fucking look around?  I think I have to at this point.  Or send Eric with the video camera so you have to leave your home.  I want to go down.  I'm going to go down to these towns.  I'm going to fucking get a beach house.  Where are we going to put our heads?  And you're all invited, motherfuckers!  Yeah!  Hey, you're on the hot day.  This is my jam!
