<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts expressing their post-holiday exhaustion using profane language.  They then announced that comedian and musician Red Peters would be a guest in studio at 4 pm, promising performances of songs including "How's Your Whole Family," "Holy Essence Christmas," and the controversial "Blow Me."  A significant portion of the early show was dedicated to a shocking Christmas card from listener Chuck Farnham, depicting a naked, quadruple amputee woman.  The hosts' disgusted reaction led to a phone call with Farnham, who defended his creation and revealed past cards included a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald's penis.  Other comedic segments included a listener's Christmas list, a "Top 10 Things Men Shouldn't Say Out Loud in Victoria's Secret" list, and a discussion about a Hispanic mobilization in Washington.  

Red Peters arrived in studio and performed "Blow Me," sparking a conversation about a DJ fined $25,000 for playing the song.  He also performed a Frank Sinatra tribute incorporating his own lyrics.  A surprise visit from the "New Christy Hamsters," a singing group mentioned in Peters' "Holy S***, It's Christmas," ensued.  The chaotic interaction included discussions of their past work with Peters, alleged alcohol consumption, and suggestive innuendo.  They performed "How's Your Whole Family" live with Peters.  Earlier in the show, a segment featured a conversation with Red about his singing career, including his rendition of the National Anthem, which was often interrupted by his Tourette's Syndrome.  The hosts joked about a potential duet and his upcoming CD.  The show concluded with further off-color jokes, anecdotes, and promotion of Peters' upcoming album and website, all while Led Zeppelin played on the radio station in the background.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The only station that really rocks Orange 9mm and failure.  Good afternoon, it's Opie and Anthony on F.U. Friday!  F.U.  Oh my!  F.U.  And this is the first day I feel awake.  Really?  In about four or five days now, yeah.  I'm just recovered from the holiday rage.  The three-day holiday rage was just an absolute success,  but everyone around here, you know, suffered the consequences.  We were all feeling like S for the last few days.  If it had been a four-day holiday rage, forget about it. 
[00:00:30]  I would be in a hospital.  Yes.  Definitely recuperating from something, man.  Hey, we've got lots to do today.  We've got Red Peters coming in today.  Finally, we've been trying to make this work for, I don't know, over a year now.  But Red Peters, I'm a big, huge fan of his.  He does that song, How's Your Whole Family.  And he does Holy Essence Christmas.  And he does the Blow Me song, and there's a rocket in my pocket.  Over you.  So he's going to sing some tunes and hang. 
[00:01:00]  He's coming in.  They're going to hang with us today, starting at 4 o'clock.  Cool.  FU's coming in, oh.  Really?  Let's see.  Now, I've got to give credit to this.  The guys in the band Chinstrap, they F'd us at exactly 3 o'clock.  Yeah.  This came through the Fax machine.  Right on.  Thank you.  Good guys.  We like FU Friday because, you know, every day of the week, people tell us to go F ourselves.  But on Friday, it's a cool thing.  That's right.  We feel the love when you do it on Friday.  So if you want to send one in, you can fax us, 931-1073. 
[00:01:30]  Keep the phones a-ringing, 931-1AF.  And you've got to stay right where you are because Chuck Farnham, our freak from the West Coast,  he sent us a Christmas card that you're not going to believe.  A Christmas card?  Yeah.  Well, I want to see it.  I'd show you now, but we've got to get him on the phone to explain because it is one of the most  demented, twisted things I've ever seen in my life.  Cool.  And you can open yours in just a few minutes, all right?  In the meantime, it's Cracker. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, it is way the hell out there.  Really?  Way out there.  All right.  The only station that really rocks, 107.3 WAF.  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  Like, how's your whole family?  All A and holy assets Christmas and some other faves, man.  Like, I got a rocket in my pocket over you.  Yeah.  So, that's going to be a lot of fun.  But right now, you've got to open up your Christmas card from Chuck Farnham.  Now, what's so weird about this?  Now, Chuck Farnham is that guy that just has a very bizarre life. 
[00:02:30]  We've talked to him many times on the radio program.  And he backs up every story he's told with pictures and stuff, right?  I want to open my own card.  I want to open that one.  I didn't open this yet for you.  So, Chuck Farnham warned us for the last month and a half that he always sends out really,  really twisted Christmas cards.  Right.  Well, I opened up mine.  And I want you to open up yours live on the air.  All right?  What is it?  Now, this is the same guy that makes Cannibal wear jewelry.  You know, that necklace I wear with the human bone? 
[00:03:00]  Last time we talked to him, he said he had to go out of state to get these printed up.  All right, here you go.  Here's your Christmas card from Chuck Farnham.  I can't wait for your reaction.  Chuck Farnham.  Okay.  He's the same guy that masturbated on his cab by accident, too.  So, in case you're wondering who Chuck Farnham is.  All right, Anthony's opening up his Christmas card from Chuck.  You're not going to believe this.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on.  Oh.  Are you kidding me?  Is that real? 
[00:03:30]  Read the caption.  Read the caption.  Oh, damn.  This can't be real.  It's real.  Now you got to put the picture in our listeners' heads for him.  This is morbidly disgusting.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, he sent us Christmas cards.  It is a woman who seems to be in her early 20s.  Who's naked on a bed.  Completely naked.  On a bed.  And she is a quadruple amputee. 
[00:04:00]  Oh.  Chuck.  What is wrong with this guy?  And the caption says holiday hugs.  Holiday hugs.  With a little snowman at the bottom.  So, she's completely naked.  She has no arms, no legs.  Big, huge, whatever.  Yeah.  Okay.  Big, yeah.  70s Earth Mama variety.  Right.  That looks like it has a rash because she's dragging it.  Ah, ah.  Dragging it on the floor, it looks like.  And then in the background, there's holiday lights and, like, holiday wrapping paper. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  It's very holiday-like and fun.  And, well, she's smiling.  Yeah, she is smiling.  And she has no arms or legs.  And this is our Christmas cards from Chuck Farton.  This guy is so twisted.  What a sicko.  We got to call him.  We got to call Chuck and try to get into his mind, man.  I am going to have nightmares.  This is the sickest picture I've ever seen in my life.  We will dial up Chuck Farnham and talk to him about his Christmas cards next.

[00:06:30]  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks ACDC from the Beavis and Butthead soundtrack, man.  God's shooting.  Those guys kick ass.  Hey, the movie opens next Friday, Beavis.  Is it next Friday?  Yeah.  Beavis and Butthead movie.  I'm sorry, I stepped out of character there.  You did.  You scared me there.  You've got to tell me when you're going to be in character.  Beavis, I'm not channeling correctly.  You know what we've got to do? 
[00:07:00]  We've got to talk to Chuck Farnham about his Christmas cards.  If you're just tuning in, what a sick SOB this guy is.  By the way, he was going to be sending the Christmas cards and to beware of the Christmas cards.  Now, when we asked him about Christmas cards, he said, well, I've got to go out of state to pick them up.  Yes.  So, well, why do you go out of state?  He goes, you'll see.  Yes.  I guess he's got to go to some secret location.  Right.  Well, we've got his Christmas cards today.  It's a picture of a girl naked on a bed. 
[00:07:30]  There's holiday lights and holiday like Christmas wrapping in the background.  All right.  But there's a slight problem.  She has no arms and she has no legs.  It's sick.  And this big 70s Earth Mama Muff is staring you in the face.  And the caption says, holiday hugs.  Holiday hugs.  Chuck Farnham.  Wow, that is twisted.  We got to get this on the website.  That's one of those shockers when we opened up the envelope. 
[00:08:00]  It was just like, whoa, the hell's going on?  We got to get this on the website.  People have been emailing about all the stuff we've been doing lately.  And we will get pictures on the website in the near future.  We will get some of the boob art pictures on the website.  Right.  We will, if management lets us, we'll put Chuck Farnham's Christmas card on the website.  No arms, no legs.  Christmas card from Chuck Farnham.  And it says, holiday hugs.  That's amazing.  Give her a few limbs and she wouldn't be that bad.  Not bad at all, actually.  We got Chuck on the line.  Do you want to talk to him real fast?  I'm not sure.  Chuck! 
[00:08:30]  Chuck.  Well, well.  Chuck, did you guys get my Christmas card yet?  That is why we're calling you.  That's why we're calling.  What the hell is wrong with you?  What?  Did I go too far?  Oh, my God.  This cannot be real.  Nice, isn't it?  Oh, my God.  This is the most horrendous thing I've ever, ever seen in my life.  Universally, everybody's freaked out.  Of course they're freaked out.  It's an amputé, man.  All four limbs. 
[00:09:00]  You know, she doesn't really look that bad.  She's smiling.  What did you think of the caption, though?  That is the best part.  All right, because there's this, you know, girl.  She has no arms, no legs, completely naked.  Blonde.  Blonde.  With a big, hairy bush.  And she's kind of cute, her face.  Yeah.  Kind of cute.  Got the holiday lights behind her.  And the caption is, holiday hugs.  Holiday hugs.  It really puts you in the festive holiday spirit, doesn't it?  Oh, my God.  You know, we were thinking of another caption. 
[00:09:30]  For this card?  Yeah.  Oh, no, I can only imagine.  No, something kind of a festive kind of holiday vein, like her stockings weren't hung by the  chimney with care because, A, she couldn't reach them, and, B, she really doesn't eat  socks.  I see some road rash going on there, too.  Of course there's road rash.  Who's going to wipe her, man?  I, of course, put the festive holiday lights on.  It's nice.  There's a wrapping paper type of background.  Yeah.  And Christmas lights all strung behind her. 
[00:10:00]  And she's on a bed or something.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fun to go down to the old photo drive-up place and have those babies printed.  Oh, my God.  They must love you.  Here comes, call the police.  He's coming back to pick them up.  Every year I use the same place.  What'd you have last year?  Last year was a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald's penis.  It's just, I'm just staring at this, and I'm disgusted. 
[00:10:30]  What's the problem?  It's weird.  Really?  Wouldn't you say?  I wouldn't.  I'm the one who sent out the card, remember?  It is just so festive.  Everybody around the office must be so proud of you, too.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I'm going to hang this one on the back of my door at the house.  Oh, I'll probably display it with all the other Christmas cards I'm getting.  Really?  Put it up on the mantle?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this year I'm getting a lot of the, I can't show this to anyone. 
[00:11:00]  You know?  What a guy.  It's holiday hugs for everyone.  It is.  All right, Chuck.  All right, guys.  Well, thank you, and happy holidays.  Same to you.  Chuck Farnham, everyone.  Live from Cali.  That is not right.  Now everyone's running into the studio to check out the Christmas card from Chuck Farnham.  Crazy Jim just looked at it.  He loves it.  He found a girlfriend.  Or a doorstop.  Or a doorstop. 
[00:11:30]  Wait, get on, Mike.  What did you say, Crazy Jim?  Crazy Jim just checked out the Christmas card.  If this chick ever gave me a hard time, I could always use her for a doorstop.  Are you ready?  She can't run away from me, at least.  Shut up.  Corn's on your damn radio.  A-A-F.  And our ticket's going on sale.  Well, call the Info Maniac Hotline and find out.  617-252-4-A-F.  That is brought to you by Executive Glass, all right? 
[00:12:00]  Dude.  Dude.  Real quick, you see this Hispanics mobilized on Washington?  They did their own, like, March.  Well, Million Man March, but it was the Spanish people, yes.  25,000 of them waving Latino flags and stuff.  And they want the president to sign a bill giving amnesty to illegal aliens and upping minimum wage to $7 an hour.  $7 an hour.  Minimum wage.  The president couldn't do it because he got to sign his name in spray paint for this Hispanic bill. 
[00:12:30]  Unbelievable, dude.  They're going to get us in trouble, man.  That's right.  And now our TV show's on the Spanish network, and you're making fun of the Spanish people.  So they couldn't find a hubcap left in Washington after they left.  I got something that someone emailed me that's pretty wacky.  What's that?  Top 10 things men shouldn't say out loud in Victoria's Secret.  Ooh.  Top 10 things men shouldn't say out loud in Victoria's Secret.  Number 10, does this come in children's sizes?  Ouch. 
[00:13:00]  Number 9, no thanks, just sniffing.  Number 8, I'll be in the dressing room going blind.  Top 10 things men shouldn't say out loud in Victoria's Secret.  Number 7, mom will love this.  That's a bad one.  Number 6, do you have this with the Dallas Cowboys logo on it?  Number 5, no need to wrap it up, I'll eat it here.  I don't get that one, really.  Top 10 things men shouldn't say out loud in Victoria's Secret.  Number 4, will you model this for me?  Number 3, oh honey, you'll never squeeze your fat ass into that. 
[00:13:30]  Number 2, 45 bucks, you're just going to end up naked anyway.  And the number 1 thing men shouldn't say out loud in Victoria's Secret, the miracle what?  This is better than world peace.  The only station that really rocks, 107.3 WAF.  That's the band Stir and Looking For.  Those guys playing Bill's Bar Saturday night on Lansdowne Street.  Did you hear what we're doing with these guys?  Yes, we're doing a write-your-own-ticket show, O.  So basically, you go to Bill's Bar to see Stir.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  You write on a piece of paper, WAF.  Yeah.  You hand it to the door guy, you get in free.  How stupid do you have to be to not be able to get into this show?  There you go.  Dang.  And I hear the...  Hey, what?  Hey, WFF, what?  Hello?  Wow.  So you do that, you get to see Stir, and I hear they're pretty cool live.  I haven't got a chance to check them out yet, so we won't be there because we're going to  be skiing at Sunday River this weekend with some faithful listeners.  You're going to be skiing.  You're going to be strapping them on, too, brother man.  I'm going to be in the lodge, drinking a toddy. 
[00:14:30]  I don't blame you.  I don't know.  I never skied before, so...  We'll get you out there, though.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll get you on a board.  You can get some fat air.  You don't have any patience, though.  See, Ope skis.  Right.  You know, so he's going to be...  And I'm just going to be at the top of the...  I'm going to be at the little bunny hill with the kids.  I will show you the bunny hill.  Like a pussy.  I'll show you the bunny hill, and then I'm gone.  Yeah, see?  See you at top of the mountain.  Well, Real Rock TV's going to be there, so...  Yeah, so we'll capture all your falls.  Maybe you could do some stunts like you did on the skateboard.  Yeah, I could do that, I guess. 
[00:15:00]  All right, hot shot.  Hey, look who we have in the studio.  Yeah!  Red Peters.  Hey, dude, thanks.  What's up?  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for having me.  No problem.  It's about time you came in to say hi to the Ope and Anthony show.  We are big fans of yours.  I've been wanting to come in for such a long time, and I don't know.  Don't ask me why I haven't been in yet.  Yeah.  And it's New England's own Red Peters.  Yeah.  That's right.  And your CD sells like crazy every year, man.  Yeah, all over the country.  It's doing pretty good.  I laughed, I cried, I fudged my undies.  I picked this up a couple of years ago, and it's one of my favorite CDs of all time, 
[00:15:30]  as far as comedy goes.  I personally like it myself.  And now that I finally got you in the studio, I've got to thank you for getting me suspended.  I did?  Well, I played the song Blow Me at a radio station in Buffalo.  I got suspended for two days.  Did you really?  Yeah.  What do I owe you?  I thought this song was so much fun, I'd put it on the radio.  Why not?  Found out they didn't like that too much.  Maybe we'll play it here today, though.  Yeah, I'll check it live if you want.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  It would be my privilege, actually. 
[00:16:00]  That'd be great.  How come you were just able to say the title?  Blow Me?  You could say Blow Me, I guess.  I guess.  Now he's saying it.  But if you sing it, you're in serious trouble.  Then you're in trouble.  Blow Me.  Right.  I think it's the next line that gets everyone in trouble, but.  What?  You hardly even know me?  What's that?  What is that?  What's that?  It's just a line.  You could say that on the street to anybody.  Something tells me we're going to cruise over that line doing 60 today.  Really?  Lock the door.  That's it.  And Lou, will you get the car running? 
[00:16:30]  Just in case.  So you guys are going to perform some songs live in the show today?  Yeah.  Well, you know, we've brought some, a few tricks with us.  See what we can do.  All right.  It supposedly has a goof commercial that's pretty funny.  Explain this, because we're going to play it.  Babe Marino, who produced the Red Peters album and who I've been with for decades now, has a dealership.  I won't say where, but, well, it is around this area.  It's called Babe's Auto Villa.  I'm sure some of your listeners have driven by it every day. 
[00:17:00]  But we have a new ad for it that Babe recorded just this week.  Oh, let's check out the new ad.  Sure.  New ad.  Babe.  Bad credit?  No credit?  No job?  No down payment?  Get the f*** out!  You want a great selection on a new used car truck or minivan?  Get the f*** out!  You want friendly service?  Service with a smile?  Get the f*** out!  That's right.  Get the f*** out! 
[00:17:30]  To Babe's Auto Villa.  Route 9, Chelsea.  Hey, I'd like a new minivan, but I have dick for credit.  Get the f*** out!  When I buy a new car, I expect good service.  Get the f*** out!  Come to Babe's Auto Villa.  Route 9, Chelsea.  Hey, did you hear what I said?  Get the f*** out!  Oh, I'm going.  I thought I'd help him out with that.  I did a cameo, a couple of cameos in there. 
[00:18:00]  That's awesome.  All right, Red's going to be here all afternoon long.  We've got lots more fun in store for you, man, so stick around.  It's FU Friday.  We're going to get loose today, right?  Yeah.  I think so.  That's just the beginning.  Trust me, man.  Here's Mad Season on AF.  Got a treat for our listeners today.  We've got Red Peters in the studio.  Hey, thank you, guys.  And we've got a studio audience.  I don't know where that came from.  Bob, Mike.  We've got a couple of guests in here today.  Mike's from Dan Ender. 
[00:18:30]  He's from Dan Ender.  He likes drinking those big Fosters, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he does.  Look at the size of them.  He likes the Fosters, man.  He's a big guy.  So we've got Red.  What's up, bro?  Hey, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  You don't sound excited.  No, no.  I really am.  Okay.  I really am.  You know we're big fans of yours.  Yes, and I apologize for that.  We're not making it out here any sooner, you know?  That's fine.  I mean, you're a New England boy doing quite well with your CDs.  Well, that's true.  I just finally got my car back on the road, you know? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah?  What was wrong with that?  Oh, it's just, you know, I drive the old cars, you know?  Yeah.  The boxes, you know what I'm saying?  We know what you're saying.  We all drive those type of cars.  I like them.  I like them.  Yes.  Now, the CD, of course, I laughed, I cried, I fudged my undies.  It's just absolutely brilliant.  A lot of people played on this album.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We had quite a few people.  We had the Hayward Jablomi Singers.  Right. 
[00:19:30]  You're familiar with them.  And there's, you know, I know you don't probably have too many people that are into rap, but we had Fudgie Johnson.  Fudgie, the Fudgie Johnson?  Yeah, the old blues guy with newer producer, rap producer, Sir Scratch Your Ass a Lot.  And, of course, they sing along with me, well, produce the Fudge Rap, which was a takeoff of a poem that I wrote during the 60s.  I was into the Rod McEwen thing. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  Really?  Poetry.  You might be familiar with the song, Did You Ever Fudge Your Undies in the Rain?  You know the kind I'm talking about?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  But, yeah, we have plenty of people.  Well, Bob Frapples.  No, Bob, right?  Bob Frapples.  Yeah, he's a kid.  Yeah, what's Bob up to lately, man?  I haven't talked to Bob Frapples.  I haven't seen him since the record.  I think he's from the North Shore somewhere.  Bob, if you're out there, you know, give us a call.  Check in.  Okay.  But, let's see.  I don't know.  We got a lot of good people on there. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, by the way, we got a surprise for you later on.  Oh, man, I don't like surprises.  Don't worry, man.  It's the holiday season.  Got a nice surprise for you.  That's all I'm going to say.  Yeah, sure.  Do you know what he's talking about?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a few people coming in.  Old friends of yours.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it Buster Hyman?  No, it's not Buster Hyman either.  Oh, man.  I don't even know who could be used.  That other rap star, Tyrone Shoelaces?  It isn't Alan Pinchloaf, is it?  No, it's not Alan Pinchloaf. 
[00:21:00]  It's the narrator on the Red Peters record?  No, it's not Alan.  Who is that Indian guy who used to play the sitar?  Oh, Mahatma Coat.  I know who it is.  Who?  It's the Dickner brothers, right?  No, no, no.  I've been heeben, you've been Dickner.  It's got to be them.  No, no, no.  It's not them.  It's just a special surprise that we'll let you in on a little later, all right?  Yeah.  One of my favorite songs off the I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged My Undies is the Blow Me song that we want to play. 
[00:21:30]  Well, you know, I was greatly affected, if that's the right word, by Frank Sinatra.  As a matter of fact, that's the first song that Babe Marino and myself recorded along with the Alan Pinchloaf singers years ago.  I don't know what year it was.  I don't want to give my age away.  But, you know, we're Sinatra lovers.  Right.  He's not doing too well.  No, you might be. 
[00:22:00]  You know something?  It kind of bums me out, because I was supposed to be on his next duet album.  Really?  Yeah.  Red Peter's doing a duet with Frank, huh?  We were even talking about doing Blow Me.  Really?  Wow.  Because I hear he really liked, you know, I had problems with Sinatra at one point.  You know, I haphazardly quoted, I was misquoted in Variety magazine, that I said I was better than Sinatra.  And then bigger than Sinatra.  What did you mean?  I meant, you know, where it counts. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, you meant where it counts.  I mean, I respect that.  I'm not saying I'm a bigger talent than you.  All right.  You just said I was bigger than him.  You had a bigger Johnson than Frank Sinatra.  Okay.  Now, what's this tribute all about that we got?  We want to play a little snippet of this.  Well, for his 80th birthday, Babe Marino and I sat down, and we took some of our favorite  Sinatra tunes and mixed them.  There's a couple of Red Peters mixed in there, just to show you.  Oh, so you put this together as a little tribute to Frank Sinatra.  Yeah, these are actual Frank Sinatra songs. 
[00:23:00]  Ah.  These are from his record.  Is Frank singing?  Let's take a listen, man.  Beautiful music.  Red Peters' tribute to Frank Sinatra.  Haunting.  You're blowing me.  You're blowing me.  You're blowing me.  In the wee small hours of the morning. 
[00:23:30]  You're blowing me.  In my easy chair.  You're blowing me.  When your lover has gone.  I want to wake up.  You're blowing me.  I want to wake up. 
[00:24:00]  You're blowing me.  It enters your face.  What is this?  You.  Okay, there we go.  Oh, my goodness.  I think we're going to get kicked off the radio for your little tribute to Frank Sinatra, man.  Hey, that was just Frank singing in his own words.  Wow.  How you edit it, you know.  That's beautiful.  I'm sure Frank was flattered. 
[00:24:30]  It's haunting.  It's a tribute.  Babe Marino.  Fabulous, I'll tell you.  He's great.  Wow.  All right.  Now, we also want to play the Blow Me song off the new record.  Or the record, okay?  Yes, indeed.  Let's check it out.  It's Red Peters on AF.  You'll love this one, man.  Hi, Dick.  Bye.  Hey, good.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye. 
[00:25:00]  Bye.  Put yourself below me, and blow me tonight.  A handy, handy, would certainly be dandy.  But it's not enough to slow me, you've got to blow me all right.  When you part your lips that way, I want you night and day. 
[00:25:30]  When you squeeze my balls so tight, I want to blow my load with all my might.  So blow me, you hardly even know me.  Just that, so blow me, you've got to blow me tonight. 
[00:26:00]  Come on, everybody.  Slow me, you hardly even know me.  You hardly even know me, so blow me.  You've got to blow me, so blow me. 
[00:26:30]  Blow me tonight.  107.3 WAF, it's Ophie and Anthony, and that's Red Peters with his blow me song from the  I Laughed, I Cried, I Fudged, My Undie CD that you can get in any record store.  Tell him what he said, Ant.  It was funny, right?  When the song starts, he goes, oh yeah, by the way, there was a DJ.  Where was he?  Rick Chase in San Francisco.  In San Francisco, got fined $25,000 for playing this song. 
[00:27:00]  Gee, thanks.  It's like, Red, couldn't you have told us before we started the song and give us the option?  No, just before, I was trying to remember something I was going to tell you.  Oh, that was it.  But then the song reminded me.  All right, more with Red Peters on the way.  Stay there.  La raja del culo de peste un pescado.  Wow, that was good, O.  You've got to love my pronunciation.  La raja del culo.  I sound like an Indian.  Cleaning guy's laughing at you. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, really?  You want to say this for me, bro?  No, he's just staring at me.  Okay.  La raja del culo de peste un pescado.  Do you know what that means?  Grab the mic over there.  No?  Uh-huh.  Okay, all right.  Against regulations, I think you said.  I guess.  Well, anyways, that phrase is, the crack of your ass smells like fish.  Ah!  Is that a necessary phrase?  As people continue to, you know, email us their favorite Spanish phrases. 
[00:28:00]  So, there you go.  Hey, on the way, if you haven't heard it yet, stick around.  We've got the brand new one from Bush.  The new CD's going to be out in early November.  We'll give you the first taste in just a bit.  I'm trying to give it a certain name.  Get that name.  Yeah, that's good.  I like that.  Rouge Pierre.  You know, people who are trying to think of last-minute Christmas gifts or whatever,  the new fragrance is out.  J-H-S.  J-H-S.  What's J-H-S?  Just had sex.  It's a new...  It's a nice fragrance.  I love that fragrance. 
[00:28:30]  That's a good one.  We need the drum today.  Boom, boom.  And you made all this money off that CD.  I laughed, I cried, I fudged my undies.  Yeah.  You know, I bought some property up in Southern Maine, an old chicken farm,  and I was going to convert it into a hamster ranch.  A hamster ranch.  And I really wasn't making any money, so I think someone took me on that one.  So I went back to raising chickens again, and I'll tell you, they're fascinating animals.  They're really fascinating.  I like hamsters better, though.  I think you could make money off of hamsters. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, why are chickens fascinating?  I mean...  Well, they're the only species that eat with their peckers.  Sorry about that.  What kind of drugs are you on, and where can I get some, man?  You know what I'm saying?  So on this CD, you got the famous song, Holy S, It's Christmas.  Right, right.  And I'll tell you, at first, my manager, Owen Money, you know, insisted that I put this  on the right, because I wasn't really proud of it, because I got duped.  You got duped? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, because originally, you know, the New Christy Hamsters, they have their annual Christmas  show, and they invited, they had heard How's Your Hole, Family.  Which you're going to do live on the show in a little while.  Yeah, in a little while.  Okay.  And they invited me to come on this show.  So they had this big thing, I was going to show up, dress like Santa, and the whole  bit.  And this, the song, which finally came out on the record, was like a rehearsal.  It was a one take, and the guys, those hamsters, believe me, I do not like them at all. 
[00:30:00]  So you didn't enjoy working with the hamsters at all?  Not at all.  Yeah, but the song's a hit, so maybe it's the hamsters that made it a hit.  I can't complain, I can't complain, as far as that's concerned, you know, but I'll tell  you, these guys, they're wise guys, they're fooling around, they switch my lyrics.  I'll tell you, I hate these guys.  You hate the hamsters.  He doesn't like the hamsters.  Uh-oh, he might not like our surprise then, but...  They're a popular singing group.  Yeah, they are.  Yeah.  They're very popular.  They, as a matter of fact, remember Paul Williams?  Sure.  The great guy.  Uh, they were on his show all the time, and, uh, I mean, they're pretty well known. 
[00:30:30]  So when they asked me to come on the show, I was, okay, I'll do it.  Right, right, right, the goodness of your heart.  I'll tell you, I've had it with the animal acts.  I'll never work with another animal act.  Wow, he doesn't like the hamsters, but they're prominently featured on this Holy S, It's  Christmas song.  Want to play it right now?  Do you mind?  Yeah, let's play it.  It is the holiday season.  Okay, it's Red Peter's, Holy S, It's Christmas on AF.  Check it out.  Hey, man, did you hear that? 
[00:31:00]  Hey, everybody, Santa's here.  Aw, there ain't no Santa Claus.  Yes, there is.  There is, too, man.  He's here.  He's here.  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Merry Christmas, boys.  Red Peter's.  Come on, you swinging hamsters, get over here.  We're gonna sing us a happy Christmas song.  Oh, no, it's not another corny, stupid song.  Yeah, no way, Red.  Yeah, you tell him, Ronnie.  Yeah, no way, no way.  Get over here and sing or I'll ring you a little neck.  Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. 
[00:31:30]  Grab your nuts, hamsters, gather round with me.  Forget about all that teasing.  We're breaking out the holly and aluminum tree,  cause it's that jolly season.  Oh, boy.  I know you've been naughty, but have you been nice?  That's only Santa's business.  That's right, Red.  He's making his list and he's checking it twice.  Oh, boy.  Holy s***, it's Christmas.  Santa comes just once a year.  Tell him if.  Just like you read, that's what we need. 
[00:32:00]  Hey, wait a minute.  He's got a soft spot for reindeer.  Oh, looks nice.  Especially Rudolph's derriere.  Hey, knock it off, fellas, it's a holiday.  Go on and give Santa a big kiss.  No way.  You can play hide the hamster on a one more sleigh.  Hey, wait a minute.  Holy s***, it's Christmas.  Hey, what happened to my lyric sheet? 
[00:32:30]  Anyone seen my lyrics?  Heck, we don't need no lyric sheet, Fred.  We know our parts by heart.  Right, fellas?  Yeah, sure.  I know my parts by heart.  Yeah, me too.  Well, that's great, guys.  I love Christmas cards.  Santa tried reaching up the neighbor's blouse after drinking all the eggnog.  Is that necessary?  Camped out in the bathroom for an hour or two.  Squashing off a U.L.A.  God, please.  We wandered his undies all over the house, but we grinded our own business. 
[00:33:00]  Till we caught us up the hamsters up and get trapped, too.  Holy s***, it's Christmas.  Santa comes just once a year.  Up the chimney, he'll disappear.  Keep on the lookout for Mr. Gale.  And stir the delivery in the air.  Roast nuts chest and on an open parson.  His tongue stuck to the doorknob.  What?  His balls got funneled by a caroling choir. 
[00:33:30]  While the parson gave him a hand.  What?  The sleigh came down and took him away.  The whole damn crowd was dismissed.  Because it's time to be dolly and it's time to be gay.  Holy s***, it's Christmas.  Holy s***, it's Christmas.  Holy s***, it's Christmas.  What are you doing?  Holy s***, it's Christmas.  Yeah.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks. 
[00:34:00]  That's Red Peters and Holy S, it's Christmas.  That sounded good.  That sounded great.  Why don't you like the hamsters, man?  They sounded great in that song.  I'll tell you, they just embarrassed me.  They taunted me.  They were making fun of me, laughing behind my back.  I just don't feel comfortable with that, you know?  The little rats, if I ever see them again, even.  You're getting me worked up about this.  Oh, Red, we got a special surprise for you.  Makes it a little awkward.  Live in the AM studio.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  You guys have a stripper coming in for me, don't you?  No, we don't have a stripper for you. 
[00:34:30]  Not a stripper.  What was that?  You can hear them in the background.  Some of your pals.  Here they come, in the doors, the hamsters.  Hey, Red.  Hey, Red.  How you doing?  Red.  Oh, it's Red Peters.  Long time no see, buddy pal.  Hey, I'm walking.  I don't like this.  It's your buds, man.  It's your buds.  Sit down, sit down.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm walking, man.  Hey, guys, man.  Keep walking, Red.  Hey, Anthony, how you doing, man?  Pretty good.  How does it feel seeing Red again?  Oh, it's not bad, yeah. 
[00:35:00]  Well, we got Raleigh and Bruce and Godfrey, man.  The hamsters.  The hamsters.  I never thought I'd see you guys again.  We've been very busy.  Getting a lot of jobs since you worked with Red?  We're in Vegas.  Vegas.  Vegas.  We're booked solid.  You're booked solid, huh?  Raleigh, man, solid.  We're working with the big people now.  Yeah.  No more Red Peter stuff.  Oh, man.  That sounds a little bitter.  I think the guy gave you a break, man.  You're dissing him.  We did something with Paul Simon. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  You did something with Paul Simon.  Yeah.  Yep.  Yep, we did.  Working with the big names.  Screw that, man.  Have you guys ever been used for sexual purposes?  I mean.  Only by Red.  Wait a minute.  He wouldn't hurt a plane unless it was open.  Oh, really?  All right.  I mean, have you ever gone up a tube?  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait.  Once I did, but it didn't count.  I needed a ride to the Cape.  That long final walk up the tube.  Godfrey. 
[00:36:00]  I didn't think that was very funny.  Yeah.  Why don't you watch your mouth?  Yeah.  You guys, do you ever meet Richard Gere?  Gere?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  You were paid not to talk about that.  Hold on.  50 bucks.  Richard Gere likes gerbils.  Let's get that straight.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Gerbils here, take me.  Yeah, me too.  Oh, my goodness.  Hey, are we going to sing with Richard?  Hey, listen.  Can I ask you guys a question?  What?  What?  You know, I, you know, we work together. 
[00:36:30]  Have you, have you worked with anyone else?  Have you, I hear you work with some cartoon characters or something?  We hate cartoon characters.  Yeah.  We hate them.  Yeah.  We're doing a serious documentary of Ross Perot.  Really?  We're into the serious stuff now.  But we hate cartoon characters.  They're very jealous people.  In fact, you know, to me, they live in a fantasy world.  Wait a minute.  I like you guys.  Hey, Gottfried. 
[00:37:00]  What?  What was it you told me?  Didn't you tell me a story about Daffy Duck or something?  Yeah, Daffy Duck.  Oh, he's on the sauce.  That's right.  Did you know that?  Daffy Duck's on the sauce.  He's got a problem.  He's got a new name now.  Lame Duck.  Lame Duck.  He's tanked, huh?  He's an outie.  He's tanked.  Wow.  He's a dude.  That's what showbiz will do to you.  One last thing.  Bruce.  What is it, man?  I saw Bruce during when we were recording this.  He drank a whole nip.  Really?  He drank a whole nip. 
[00:37:30]  An entire nip.  An entire nip.  Wow.  That's got to be a whole ounce.  It took me all night long.  Bruce the hamster drank a whole nip, huh?  A whole nip.  All right, let's hear it.  Was it hanging upside down in the cage and he did that little...  They accused me of putting vodka in their water bottle.  Wow.  No kidding.  He looks good now.  He looks like he's been working out, though.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He spends a couple hours on the wheel every day.  The hamster wheel?  You guys are going around and around?  We all go a couple hours. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  The wheel.  Well, let's hear it for the hamsters, everyone.  Surprise guest on the Opie and Anthony show with Red Peters.  Merry Christmas.  Geez, are they obnoxious.  They really are obnoxious.  Now I know why you don't like them.  See what I mean?  All right.  So you're going to do How's Your Whole Family next, bro?  That's right.  I'm going to go warm up in the bathroom right now.  You're going to do it live on the show, huh?  That's correct.  That's going to be a treat.  Stick around for Red Peters.  Here's the Meat Puppets on AAF.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks Pearl Jam from no code. 
[00:38:30]  Hell, hell.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And a lot of people are asking what's going to be on the next WAF Real Rock TV show.  I mention that because I'm hearing Pearl Jam playing here.  And I know for a fact they got some footage from the Pearl Jam shows.  Really?  That's going to be on the Real Rock TV show with our new friends WUNI,  the channel 27 on most cable systems, I guess.  The Spanish speaking station.  So we're going to have some Pearl Jam footage from the shows. 
[00:39:00]  Cool.  I guess you're going to be doing your...  I'm going to do my Howard thing.  Your imitation of the king.  Yeah.  We set it up to look just like the E! show.  And I was doing my Howard impression.  Very cool.  I'm looking forward to seeing that.  Also, I guess some footage when we broadcast it live right next to WAVU.  We were throwing those bowling balls through the TVs while they were tuned in to Channel 68.  Yeah, the candle pin bowling balls.  Throwing them.  And then you see some nut pick one up and body slams one of the TVs.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah.  Hopefully that'll be on the show. 
[00:39:30]  Also, I guess Orange 9mm when they were in town.  Yes.  And also Local H.  Yeah.  And other stuff.  So it's going to be a jam-packed second show.  We're mentioning the TV show a lot today because a lot of people thought that the show was only on once.  No, it's every Saturday at midnight.  W-U-N-I at 12 o'clock, like I said.  And the shows are only going to get better.  We have so much footage in the can.  I can't wait to see what future shows look like.  Yeah.  All right.  Should be a lot of fun over the next few weeks.  Now, where the hell is Rocco? 
[00:40:00]  I wanted to talk to him here.  Oh, God.  He's not here?  All right.  I guess he'll be in here in 10 minutes when his show starts.  I hope so.  In the meantime, we might as well play the latest from Bush.  Bush.  Bush.  CD comes out in November.  Want a taste?  You got a taste.  Wiggle.  You know, I got to bring this up.  He's shipping all night long.  I have to bring this up.  I don't want to say you're ripping anything off, but weren't there some things called the chipmunks back in the...  Yeah, we don't like them. 
[00:40:30]  We made them.  Back in the 60s.  We made them.  You made them?  You made them, huh?  We made them, baby.  They ripped you off.  They ripped us off.  They ripped us off.  Big time.  Way back.  Big time.  You guys have never been used for sexual favors before, the hamsters.  Only by Red.  By Red, yeah.  Here we go.  Tell it.  But it was kind of fun.  But it was kind of fun.  In the laugh.  I'm going to ring there next.  We had a couple of laughs.  Hey, two hamsters are walking by a gate.  I got to tell that job.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  Let's go in and get S-faced.  Okay.  I want another nip.  All right.  All right.  Shut up.  I hate rodents with attitudes.  Yeah, no doubt.  He's on his second nip.  I want one more nip, Red.  He's on his second nip.  He's on his second nip.  One more nip.  Those nips to a hamster.  My God.  They're a full ounce.  Wait.  We want to talk to Red for a few minutes.  All right.  First of all, I got to ask everyone, ask Red actually, when the new CD's coming out.  Because a lot of New Englanders.  New England.  Right.  They picked up the first CD. 
[00:41:30]  I laughed and cried.  I punched my undies.  And we want to know when the second CD is coming out.  Well, we're working on it.  We'll be going into the studio after the holidays.  All right.  And it's probably going to take us around the same amount of time it took us to record this one.  In around six months.  Oh, I thought you were going to say six years.  Okay.  That's the truth.  It did say six years.  That's hamster time.  See, hamster lights.  Right.  Okay.  But, no, actually, I hope to have it finished by opening day at Fenway Park.  I hope to sing the national anthem. 
[00:42:00]  Well, Roger Clemens won't be there.  That's right.  That bastard.  That rat bastard.  Why even the hamsters don't like him?  Hey, let's give him a special, you know, it's FU Friday, right?  Right.  FU Friday.  Right.  FU Roger.  He went for the damn money.  Can you believe it?  He's not even worth that cash, boys and girls.  He knew if he stayed around here, the press would eat him up if he sucked as bad as he did.  Right, right.  And in two years, he signed a four-year deal. 
[00:42:30]  In two years, it's going to make this deal a joke.  It is.  He's not that good anymore, man.  He had about one, maybe two good years left.  I'm sure he's still got a few games left, good games left.  Of course he does, but he's not worth all that money for four years.  I'm just sorry.  So now the Red Sox have all that money, they could go out and get some other players.  Just to stand there and have to listen to O Canada.  Well, this is going to be a treat.  We've got Red Peters in the studio, and he's going to do How's Your Whole Family live for  us.  That's right.  We've been jamming this record for so long. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Hey, thanks for spinning it.  No problem.  Hey, Red, do you mind if we join in?  Want us to join in, Red?  Oh, boy.  Come on.  Come on, Red.  Come on.  Come on.  Lighten up, will you?  Let me ask them.  Let me ask them.  Okay.  Do you guys mind if they join in on the song?  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah, we do.  Come on.  Maybe.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Christmas, man.  Can we pull them way down a minute, man?  Yeah, put them way down.  Yeah.  All right.  Just pull their volume back.  You just try that.  All right.  We're putting you way down here, boys and girls.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  It's Red Peters.  How's Your Whole Family live in the studio? 
[00:43:30]  How's your whole family, how's your whole family, how's your whole family, how's your  whole family, Anthony, how's your whole family, how's your whole family, how's your whole family, 
[00:44:00]  Family, how is your whole family?  How's your dick?  Fine, Red.  Tation machine, how's your dick?  How's your dick?  Tation machine, how's your dick?  How's your dick?  Tation machine, how is your dick?  Tation machine, take your pants down to the cleaners today.  Take your pants down to the cleaners today. 
[00:44:30]  Take your pants down to the cleaners today.  Take your pants down to the cleaners today.  Let me get my hands on those hands.  You very little rat.  Get him, Red.  Godfrey, get over here.  I ought to, you little rat pants.  Won't you do my ass?  Astrological chart, won't you do my ass? 
[00:45:00]  Astrological chart, won't you do my ass?  Astrological chart, won't you do my astrological chart?  Suck on a stiff cock.  Tail with me, suck on a stiff cock.  Tail with me, suck on a stiff cock.  Tail with me, suck on a stiff cock.  All right, everybody, including you, hamsters, how's your whole family? 
[00:45:30]  Open in there, let's turn it together, huh?  All you people out there in your cars, throw your windows down, sing, how's your whole family?  How's your whole family?  How's your whole family?  How's your whole family?  How is your whole family?  How's your whole family?  Yeah, Red Peter's live in the studio. 
[00:46:00]  Awesome.  Awesome.  Wow.  Harmonizing hamsters.  Nice.  I told you we could sing.  Yeah, you guys did all right, man.  You did all right.  Hey, Red, you know the hamster nip in here?  He's getting tanked.  Get him up with another nip.  Okay.  They did such a fine job.  Nips for all the hamsters.  Hey, Red, what is that name?  Uh, it's a study hall.  You ever be in study hall and you hear, I never went to school. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, yeah, that's right.  That's the sound of a hamster exiting.  Oh, that makes sense.  Wow.  That's really funny.  That's not very funny.  Yeah.  They're nice, nice hamsters.  Uh, it's nice to see a reunion here like this.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, guys, uh, what do you say, let's bury the hatchet.  Bury the hatchet.  I'll bury the hatchet.  Yeah, I'll show you where we'll bury that hatchet.  What do you say we do another Christmas song for next year? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, wait.  I don't know.  Okay, all right.  How much?  Damn it.  How much?  How much?  How much?  Really, as a good deal for us.  It's a bill.  We're in the union now, so.  We're in the union.  All right, have you on manager call, Owen Money, set it all up.  Owen Money.  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll have our hamster call your lawyer and.  All right, let's hear it for the hamsters.  Get out of here.  I just, I just shut up their mic, Red, so.  Oh, man, they aggravate the heck out of me.  And we want to thank you for coming by.  Do you want to hang out for a little longer or is this it? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, we'll hang around.  We're going to go through the CD racks and stuff, see if we find anything we like.  Okay.  I'm only kidding.  All right.  Wow, I sound like an intern.  Rocks 107.3 WAF, Stone Temple Pilots and Tumble in the Rough.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, it's Red Peters, it's the hamsters, it's Mike, it's Bob.  It's everyone.  We've got about 20 people in the studio today.  Everyone say hi.  Hi.  So there you go.  We had a lot of fun today, Red.  I appreciate you stopping by.  Hey, thank you guys for having me, really. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, you want to take another look at our Christmas card?  Stop.  Put that down.  Wow, that's a good one.  Red's gagging.  Yeah, if you weren't listening earlier, Chuck Farnham, our wacko friend from the left coast,  sent out his Christmas cards and he gave me an ant one.  And it's a Christmas card of a naked girl on a bed.  Wow, that sounds good.  So I don't know why Red is puking.  Why are you puking, Red?  Maybe the fact that she's a quadruple amputee. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, well, it's a naked girl with no arms, no legs on a bed with lovely Christmas lights,  though, in the background.  You like that?  I don't care what you say.  She's cute.  She is cute.  I thought she was cute.  How many beers would it take to go home with this?  Beers?  You're talking heroin.  You are so far past alcohol on that. 
[00:49:00]  You are definitely talking some real hallucinogenic drugs, man.  So this is our lovely Christmas card.  Look at our 70s earth mama.  Ooh, look who just walked in.  Ah, Angie!  Hello.  All right, we'll talk to Angie next.  Yeah.  Because now she's like, what the hell is going on in here?  We're just showing our nasty Christmas card we just got.  It's a naked woman with no arms or legs.  We just shocked her to tell.  And the funny thing is the caption. 
[00:49:30]  Did you read the caption of our amputee?  Holiday hugs.  Holiday hugs.  She can receive, but she can't give.  What's her name?  What's her name, Hope?  Bobette?  You can't say it?  Something swell up.  It's really her name.  That old gag.  She's got no name.  Yeah, okay.  Swaylo.  Swaylo, yeah. 
[00:50:00]  You guys are bad news, man.  We've gone on the edge.  Why don't you tell the amputee joke?  Oh, about the girl laying on the beach?  Yeah, she has no arms and no legs.  She's got no arms and no legs.  And a guy walks up to her and she goes, I want you to F me good.  So he goes, all right.  She goes, I wanted you to F me good in the water.  He goes, all right.  He grabs her, swims out with her in the middle of the ocean, drops her off and starts swimming back.  She goes, what are you doing? 
[00:50:30]  He goes, there, you're F'd.  Yeah, F word is the curse word for intercourse.  I think we gathered that.  Okay, so we've got to thank Red for stopping in.  Yeah.  We had a lot of fun.  People could still pick up this lovely CD, right?  Yes, it's from the CD, Red Peters.  I laughed, I cried, I fudged my undies.  Holy S, it's Christmas is on here.  And Blow Me and How's Your Whole Family and Rock It In My Pants.  This is a really funny CD.  Any Grammy nominations on that one? 
[00:51:00]  We've got a couple of Grampies.  Grampies?  Oh, that's a little different.  Yeah, you know, it's funny you ask because it just went aluminum last week.  It went aluminum.  Okay.  And your listeners, don't be afraid to check out the Red Peters site on the Worldwide.  Oh, he's got a website.  No, I haven't even checked this out yet.  It's www.redpetersoneword.com.  That's www.redpeters.com.  Check it out.  A lot of fun stuff on there.  Now, do you spell out Red Peters one word? 
[00:51:30]  No, no, no.  See, now I knew this.  We're going downhill.  Now we're losing it.  Okay.  It's redpeters.com.  All little letters, you know, lowercase.  Okay.  Am I getting to it?  No, no.  And then the new CD's coming out, hopefully in time for opening day.  Opening day because, you know, I have been making a lot of money this summer singing the National Anthem at different events, cockfights.  Cockfights.  Anthony, you'll be proud of me. 
[00:52:00]  Tourette Syndrome benefits.  Oh, but you've been singing those, really?  Regional.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And you sing the National Anthem?  Yeah, I'll tell you, you can make a lucrative, make a lot of cash.  Do you do it with Tourette's?  Oh, say can you see, I can't keep back in yet, by the dawn's early light.  Hoo-ha, hoo-ha.  Want soap?  I'd like to give that a whirl.

Take it from there.  By 12, I'll be sounding like I'm having a seizure.  Hey, man, maybe we can do a duet.  I don't know.  Yeah, let's work on that.  All right, Red, thanks for coming by, man.
