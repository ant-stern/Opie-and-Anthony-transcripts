<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion about a false news story claiming Opie tried to visit Warner Bros. dressed as Superman. This leads to a conversation about costumed characters around the Chinese Theatre, their territoriality, and a comparison to *Superman III*.  Guest Jason Mewes recounts being falsely reported dead twice.  He then details his struggles with crack addiction, gambling, and cigarettes, graphically describing his drug use, including rectal injection, scoring drugs, and encounters with other addicts. Fellow guest "Boss" adds his own experiences with addiction, sex work, and gambling, sharing stories of being ripped off and threatened. Mewes describes his paranoia during addiction, including believing his girlfriend was communicating with someone hidden under the bed. Another guest shares anecdotes about his drug dealing, including a customer paying with a jug of pennies.  Kevin Smith then reads a darkly humorous self-deprecating poem written by Jim Norton at age 17 during rehab at Princeton House, prompting commentary from the hosts and guests.  The segment concludes with a chaotic incident involving Bernie Getz, who becomes enraged believing his CD was destroyed, leading to yelling, a near altercation (with Getz allegedly kneeing Opie), and Getz storming out after Eric intervenes.  Comedian Billy Burr is mentioned as being in the studio.

The show continues with a description of a street stunt where Anthony, wearing a Nazi helmet, competes with Patrice to hail a cab first, ostensibly to comment on racial bias in cab driver passenger selection. Anthony wins. This is followed by a recurring bit about a building security guard who repeatedly denies entry/exit to staffer Jimmy without ID.  The hosts and Jimmy plan a prank: Jimmy will carry a large box, filled with pictures of male genitalia and eventually a dildo, out of the building, labeled "Free Puppy".  They brainstorm names for the bit, settling on "Must Get Box of Cocks Past Piece of Shit Bit," and spend time preparing the box's contents. A caller, Jason from New Hampshire, compliments the show.  A side conversation about the hosts' memories of deceased presidents ensues. Jimmy executes the prank, with the hosts observing the reactions of passersby.

The "Free Puppy" prank is further discussed, detailing the reactions of passersby (described with offensive language), the poorly designed box lid, and Craigâ€™s sabotage.  The hosts' commentary includes sexist, racist, ageist, and homophobic remarks.  The fallout with supervisor Elo is discussed, leading to a retaliatory campaign to flood Elo's inbox with penis pictures.  Strategies for prank improvement are discussed, along with alternative objects for the box.  Multiple phone calls with listeners and Elo occur, with continued offensive language.

A "Box O'Cocks" contest ensues, overwhelming the XM email server with listener-submitted pictures.  The hosts and their assistant read and react to the subject lines.  A caller, Eero, provides running commentary. A "dump report" details the day's most outrageous statements, with Louis C.K. prominently featured, using crude language and discussing sexually suggestive topics, including explicit details from his childhood.  The "Ultimate Challenge" follows: a contest involving placing testicles in a container of bees.  Fez Whatley from the Ron and Fez Show is a guest, observing as two contestants participate, with one getting stung multiple times.  The challenge involves equipment malfunctions and chaotic banter. The segment ends with continued attempts to complete the challenge and further discussion of an intern's perceived gayness.

The final segment features the hosts ribbing guest Noah about perceived effeminate mannerisms, making crude jokes about his sexuality and asking passersby for their opinion on his gayness.  They humorously interrogate Noah about a past sexual encounter, pressing him for details despite his attempts to deflect, and comment on his expensive outfit compared to their own.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  where I was maintaining, after I wrote the script,  that I wanted to be in the movie and play Superman.  I showed up at Warner Bros. wearing a Superman costume.  I remember that.  And I was just like, what?  That's not true.  Gee.  I mean, I don't even know where to begin.  What part of that story is not true.  Like, what weird world would I ever want to be, like, in the movie as Superman?  As anybody, you know, really.  That was a strange thing.  And then to go to the extent of getting a costume and putting it on.  And showing up.  Because you always hear those stupid stories.  Hanging out of the blue suit and over the belt. 
[00:00:30]  So you'd have to get yourself in shape.  You're like Superman in front of the Chinese Theater and shit.  That dude.  Oh, that guy.  Have you guys been out to Hollywood right now?  Yeah, those guys near us.  It's insane now.  Everybody, like, hawking.  It's because anybody could do it.  Like, I used to think it was kind of some licensed thing  that the Gromans Chinese Theater hired him.  But no, people just show up.  And they're real territorial about it.  They get tight, man.  Like, one guy will be Superman there at once.  Superman, yeah.  Yeah, and he'll kick the shit out of another Superman if he comes over there. 
[00:01:00]  That would be awesome.  That would be awesome.  It'd be like watching Superman.  What was that?  Superman 3 when he fought himself.  And Richard Pryor was there.  And apparently there's this big Elmo.  That black guy.  Dirty Elmo.  So he's filthy Elmo.  It just stinks.  It's the scariest thing.  And then every once in a while, you'll see him, like, it gets really hot.  The dude takes off his head.  And he's sitting there, Elmo body, human head.  Yeah, human head.  Confusing every child.  Like, they don't know which one they're more distressed by.  When he's filthy with the dirty T-shirt and the dirty red hair. 
[00:01:30]  Or when he takes his fucking hat off and it's a dude underneath.  Do you think it smells inside that mask?  Oh, God, man.  He stinks.  And why haven't people come after those people, like, licensing?  You would think they were just...  I don't know.  You would imagine.  But, like, some of them are just close enough.  Like, Elmo is not, like, the official Elmo.  It's, like, some guy.  A blind dude put it together.  Elmo.  A slight difference.  But those people collect.  It's, like, ten bucks a shot.  Ten bucks a shot to get that.  Yeah, to get a picture with him?  Twenty to fuck Elmo in the mouth. 
[00:02:00]  Jason, what about you?  What was the craziest thing you read about yourself that wasn't true?  Nothing.  That I died.  Oh, yeah, right.  Oh, that's true?  Oh, wow.  I forgot about that.  That is pretty crazy.  You're not dead.  Twice it was in the papers that I was dead.  That you were dead.  How is that to read?  Jesus.  You know, I didn't read it.  People were telling me, though, so...  Yeah.  But, yeah, it's pretty weird.  That's kind of cool, actually.  How fucking great is that, man?  Do you get all the sympathy?  Like, oh, we thought you were gone.  No, appreciate me now.  Let me come back and I'm still alive.  Give me dope. 
[00:02:30]  Free dope.  No, but I'm working on it.  Shit, man.  How long have you been off?  Three years.  A little over three years.  Like three years, three months.  Damn.  Wow.  Did it go quick for you?  Because it seemed to go quick for me.  I'm thinking you were just...  Not for me, because I don't do drugs.  I was dead last week.  I thought you were dead.  No, I thought you were still...  I thought it was about a year, but wow.  Since three years.  That's pretty good.  Nice.  Look at these two.  I know.  How long?  Boss? 
[00:03:00]  20 years.  20 years.  20 years of what?  Boss used to suck such a mean cock for crack.  That's right.  This guy had sucked such great cock.  No, I never sucked a dick for a crack.  I did it for a fuck.  Don't fuck yourself.  Don't mix it up.  He would never sully a good cock sucking with drugs.  All right?  I got three off of gambling and a fucking month and two days off of cigarettes, which is tougher  than all of them.  Yeah, that's a tough one.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Nice.  What was the gambling? 
[00:03:30]  What was your poison?  Craps.  Like, you know, anybody...  Same with freebies.  What's left?  You gave up the drugs.  You gave up gambling and cigarettes, but no booze.  What do you do for fun?  Fucking golf and buy clothes.  I'm a fucking second.  That's a fucking dick.  There you go.  I missed that part.  Darth Vader hair.  Let me tell you something.  There is a part where you need a vice, though, you know?  Well, you know, crack, you know, because like when you gamble, like crack, once you  start smoking freebies and you want somebody snorting, you're going, you're fucking  wasting it.  Right.  Same with shooting craps. 
[00:04:00]  If you see somebody playing blackjack, what the fuck?  Why gamble is such a boring thing?  Shoot craps.  Right.  Shoot the load quick and fucking have some excitement.  I mean, get high.  If you're going to get high, get fucking high.  Don't be able to.  Yeah, you don't understand sitting there for hours pacing yourself.  What is it?  I'm not a drug guy, so the idea of freebies is better than snorting it?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  It's like we're in a book backwards.  It's like the freebies is like fucking...  It's that boom, bam, right there.  Yeah, right there.  And then you spend the rest of the night trying to find that first hit, which never, ever 
[00:04:30]  comes.  What you got to do is just double up your next hit.  All of our palms are sweating.  When you said Worcester, when we're doing a show on Worcester, I picked a girl from Worcester.  Where at Worcester, Mass?  Whatever.  You fucking speak Worcester than anyone I've ever heard.  Horrible.  Worcester.  I was working...  When you said we're doing a tour there.  In where?  In where?  Up in Mass.  Up in fucking Worcester.  Whatever it's called. 
[00:05:00]  What the fuck do I know?  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester.  Worcester?  Yeah.  I worked a place that had plums and I picked up a waitress.  We drove back to New York from there and I copped $500 worth of coke, sat in a shitty  hotel room, fucked her and smoked coke all night, and drove back up to Boston broke to  do one more night.  That's how powerful...  I mean, you would do...  The glory.  The glory of it all.  I always thought smoking was a waste when you could shoot it.  What?  He goes, one better. 
[00:05:30]  He just dropped you hardcore in your ass.  So wait, the feeling of shooting it is even better than smoking it?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, sir.  Come on.  Right into...  Did you ever...  It's so right into the veins.  Did you ever do that?  My bong hole, too.  I was going to say, did you ever do the rectal thing?  I did.  You shot in your asshole?  Yeah.  Who did it for you?  Did you do it yourself or have somebody do it for you?  Jose Canseco came over.  I did it myself.  Did you by yourself?  Why?  Are you just afraid to show people your bong or no?  Don't trust them enough?  You want to know a little story?  I do. 
[00:06:00]  Because the point broke off my syringe and I already had it loaded.  So I didn't, you know...  Holy shit.  Wait a minute.  So the point breaks off so you can't...  So you can't put it in your vein.  Yeah, so...  And I didn't...  There's a contingency plan for that?  I never know.  There's a backup plan for that?  Oh, yeah.  Up the ass?  Up the bong piece.  So wait, so you're not injecting it into the ring?  You're sticking it in your ass and just letting the liquid fly?  Let it sit in your intestine?  Doesn't leak out or anything?  Well, you've got to hang upside down. 
[00:06:30]  So you've got to hold it and hope that the blood vessels in your lower intestine absorb it?  Yeah.  Wow.  But you think banging it is a quicker rush than smoking?  I don't know.  Listen, not at all am I glorifying any of this shit.  Don't get me...  I'm just...  Yes, you are.  You were chuggy.  I don't know.  That one hotel night with the...  That sounded fun.  Yeah, I was like, wow, what a night.  That sounded fun.  Oh, fucking great.  There was not one bad thing that came out of it.  No.  And then you went back to work?  No problem. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, he was actually responsible enough to drive and finish his gig.  You had it all.  What were you doing?  Sounds like a fun trip.  You're driving back to Boston from here.  You live here, but you've got to drive back there.  Your nose is bleeding.  What is that, six-hour drive?  I don't know, four and a half.  It was just horrible.  Were you depressed driving back?  We went into, like, Hartford, and we tried to cop some heroin and coke.  See, that's what I imagine with the problem.  The problem is, like, trying to score.  Like, that seems to be the...  I mean, of course, there's so many downsides, but it's the hunt that I think would bug me. 
[00:07:30]  Well, that's the excitement, too, is going to cop.  I mean, that's part of the excitement.  Really?  Yeah, we had a...  See, this girl, too, like I met, she goes...  And this...  I was a drug addict then.  She goes, I want to buy an ounce of coke, my sister.  And I was going to get the money, and obviously, I would have ripped her off.  Right?  Of course.  That's what she did.  You do as a drug addict.  I know.  It goes to that same.  I would have ripped her off.  But four years later, thank God I didn't, I'm working at a club in Florida, and she's  there with her boyfriend, who's as big as a house.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:08:00]  So if I would have ripped her off, I would have got fucking killed.  Four years later.  But that's what you think about is just...  You're not...  You know, just...  You got ripped off, didn't you, in Newark?  Yeah, a few times.  More than once?  At gunpoint, or they just took off?  No, no, they just took it.  There's...  In the hallway in Newark.  Yeah, it's...  No honor, man.  Nice fucking honor.  I was about to get fucked up one time.  Yeah, knife, too.  Knife.  Good Lord.  I was in the projects in New Brunswick.  I was actually getting crack, and I was such a...  I was so drunk, and I fucking walk into the projects, and I go up the steps. 
[00:08:30]  The guy goes, come up here.  So he was going to take me up.  Oh, good idea.  I was so dumb, and we're on the landing way, and this guy, Rodney, I knew, who lived in  the projects, walked in and said hello to me, and we talked to him.  He goes, no, don't go up there, man.  Take care of him right here.  So Rodney knew it was about to happen.  Maybe he was going to give me a special deal.  Yeah, the discounts are all upstairs.  When you hear stories like this, don't you just feel like, man, I've lived a really sheltered  life.  Yeah, no kidding.  Like, I used to think I was edgy, and then you hear shit like that, and I'm like, man... 
[00:09:00]  I was always too afraid of jail to do anything that was really bad.  You know, stupid stuff with knocking down mailboxes with your car or shit like that.  But I heard stories like, you know, hey, you want to take the car, and I got to pick  up a kilo in the city, and it's like, yeah, that's what I want to do.  Get caught with a kilo of fucking coke under my car seat.  All I'm thinking is, you know, oh, there I am sucking big black cock in prison.  That's the first thing that comes to your mind.  It's going to be about black. 
[00:09:30]  Exactly.  Cocks and cocks.  Because there's only one thing worse than sucking white cock.  I don't think we'll get anyone denying that.  It's hilarious.  It's just kept me out of, you know, trouble, and that kept me from doing that shit.  I wrote a bit on this, and this is true.  I pulled up in Harlem, and I go to this guy, what do you got?  And he showed me, like, five vials, and I snatched him out of his hand.  He punched me twice in the face.  He went, bam, bam, right, and I'm all fucked, so I drive away.  I go, let me get the fuck out of here.  You know, I'm in Harlem, and I'm getting punked. 
[00:10:00]  You're sharp.  So I'm not lying.  I'm banging on cars, and I got the five vials in my hand, or three, and I throw in the pipe,  and it was soap, right?  Oh, jeez.  He's hitting me in the face for ripping him off of fucking soap, right?  So I pull back on him and go, you don't rip me off when I'm ripping you off.  He hit me over five.  It's soap, you fucking douchebag.  At least, I don't know what part of that story is more horrible. 
[00:10:30]  And also, I just sit there going, all right, it's me, and I put myself in boss's shoes,  and I'm just like, the dude punches me in the face once.  Yeah.  And that's it.  I don't drive away.  I pass out.  You're done.  You're knocked out.  I can't see where the fist hits me.  I see it coming, and my nerve ending is down.  I've never been one for getting hit.  I go to complete physical shock.  My buddy Mike was a bodybuilder who I got sober with, and he eventually relapsed out  of a heart attack, and he's dead.  But he was getting high all the time in Harlem.  But he was in Harlem.  I didn't know him when he was active, and he's a big little fucker, man. 
[00:11:00]  He was a stocked...  Big little fucker.  I mean, short, but fucking, he was a problem.  And he went up into Harlem, and he was fucking getting high, and he said he came out, and  his car was on blocks, and he just fucking broke down and cried.  And a hooker helped him.  A prostitute actually helped him.  I try to sell my friend's car.  When he lent me his car, I pull it.  I go...  You were really, really wrong.  I got the radio.  I got the radio out.  Oh, we got out of the car.  I went up there with comics, Keith Barney, some guy, and I get out of the car. 
[00:11:30]  There's no lie.  There's a guy chasing another guy around the car with a butcher knife.  And so the guy goes, don't get out of the car.  I go, he's not fucking after me.  That's another thing going on.  I walk by, and I go, what's happening?  And I had the keys to the front doors in place this day.  I mean, it was just...  It was so fucking crazy.  We took David Spade hostage.  When he first came to New York, when he was a con, he was from Arizona.  He's this little white kid.  He's doing props.  So we're doing a gig, me and Frankie Bastille.  Frankie's a heroin addict, and I'm a crack addict. 
[00:12:00]  So we're driving, and David Spade is coming with us to this gig.  Like, on the way back from Jersey, we said to him, hey, look, we got to make a couple  stops.  And he's this little timid guy then.  And I go, look, I got to go up and see my sister.  She lives uptown.  So I go up to cop crack up in like 158th and after whatever.  He's on 57th.  Right?  And this guy's frightened.  He's there.  He's from Arizona.  Then Frankie goes to the lower east side.  Right?  And he's like, can you drop me off?  And we go, hey, we got shit to do.  I'm driving. 
[00:12:30]  I'm driving.  He's sitting in the front seat, and Frankie's in the back, banging dope.  Right?  He's going, look, I just want to get out of here.  The dude's like, bye-bye.  You know, you got to do what you got to do first.  Did you all make it to the gig?  That was after the gig.  Sounds like another fine story where no one got hurt.  At the end of the day, everyone gets to their job.  Nice David Spade story.  It's a cute story, but fast forward 15 years, Rich, David. 
[00:13:00]  Does this shit bug you at all, Jason?  Like talking about it?  No.  Did it years ago?  Like when you first, maybe your first year?  It's not like smoking when you...  I mean, if I'm around it, I mean, if I like, I went out and been around people doing coke  and stuff, and that bothers me.  It just makes me more sick, because I just, I see what I was doing.  And it's just, it's retarded.  Like, just sex stories like that, just doing the stupidest stuff, like ending up, 
[00:13:30]  and the nights, if I was at a club, I just wanted to do drugs all night.  So I'd go home with these random people and just be like in the middle of nowhere.  Like, and then they'd run out of coke, and I want more.  Everyone's like going right to sleep.  I'd be like, man, let's get more.  And just like in the middle of the woods, like, man, we're going to bed.  And I'd be like, stop, because I wouldn't know where I was.  Like an hour from like, wherever.  All you cared about was getting there.  And like going two and three in the morning to Elizabeth and the projects, and hanging  out in shooting galleries with like, people nodding out next to you, you don't know, and 
[00:14:00]  shit.  So when you're copping, when you're copping in New York, it's a little more glamorous.  You go to Harlem and stuff.  In Jersey, you go to Elizabeth.  Oh, God.  North shooting galleries, man.  I mean, it was a horrible time.  I'm so glad that it's over.  But there were like moments that in retrospect are like really hysterical.  And there was one of the byproducts was like this weird paranoia that this dude used to  get.  And we lived in this apartment in Red Bank.  And he was dating this chick, Stephanie. 
[00:14:30]  And one morning I got up, and his room was on the way to the kitchen.  And I stumble in the kitchen, and I see Muse laying on the floor outside the door of his  room.  And the door is cracked open about an inch.  And he's staring into the room.  And I'm like, what's up?  And he's like, shh, waving the hand and pointing at the room.  And I was like, what's up?  And he's like, just shh.  And so I look through the room, and I peer through the crack.  And it's like his old lady's in bed sleeping.  And so I go to the kitchen.  He follows me.  I was like, what's going on?  He's like, I'm pretty sure somebody's under the bed. 
[00:15:00]  And he's like, what?  I was like, what are you talking about?  He's like, I see her lips moving.  And I think she's talking to somebody under the bed.  I think she snuck some dude in.  And she's trying to fuck him.  Holy shit, that is kind of right.  It was fucking insane.  Wow.  Yeah, it was weird, because it wasn't cops or anything.  Like, anyone was after me.  It was always, I was always dating someone.  I was, like, just girl after girl, getting high with them.  And it got really bad.  The worst thing was, I was living in Huntington Beach with this girl.  And I swear, it got to where I'd make her come in the bathroom with me, 
[00:15:30]  because if I went to the bathroom, I'd swear I'd hear her talking to somebody.  And I'd run in.  Wow.  And she'd sit there watching TV.  What's up?  And I'd be like, who's in here?  Who are you talking to?  She's like, what are you talking about?  And it got so bad that I swear, I thought that I started sleeping with my legs wrapped  around her like this, because I swore that she cut a hole in our mattress, and there was  a dude in there with a hole.  So I started, I really started going crazy. 
[00:16:00]  Shooting crack is not good.  It will make you go insane.  A hole in the mattress.  Yeah.  And some dude would diddle her.  Yeah.  Diddle, yeah.  It was insane.  And, like, my friend one time came and slept over, a really good friend of mine.  And I woke up, and I, and he was downstairs, and she was right next to me, and I swore,  like, that I heard him running down the stairs and went down and, like, started a fight with  him.  And I was like, get out of my house!  And he's like, dude, what's up?  He's just sitting on the couch smoking dope and shit. 
[00:16:30]  Trying to just mellow out.  He was a fucking lunatic that comes running in.  It was, it was, it got, yeah, I started, I seriously started going, like, crazy.  A hole in the mattress, sir.  That is.  That takes imagination.  Really?  Like, that is, I bought, I bought one of those voice-activated recorders and put it under  a pillow, so, like, when I would go to the store, come back, and it got, I swear that  I'd play the tape, and I'd hear her on the tape talking to people.  Like, all crackly, baby.  And then I'd have one of my friends talk, listen, and they'd be like, dude, we hear nothing 
[00:17:00]  but air.  I want to do this shit sober.  I want one of those things.  You'd hear, like, things, you'd hear, you'd hear things in the hissing?  Yeah, like, it's just, like, bleh, bleh, bleh.  It's like, what is that movie, White Noise?  Like, I couldn't understand what was going on.  Yeah, yeah, White Noise.  The DMD and shit.  We diddle you through the matches tonight.  It's a message from space, and it's Hitler.  Here's the, uh, fucking, uh, contact.  Wow.  Man, no stuff.  That is some paranoia.  I, I, you know, been through people at my house when we, we used to, uh, me and my brother 
[00:17:30]  used to deal just to support what we were doing.  We never really did a lot.  Coke, you know, uh, we, people would come over, and we'd free base and stuff, and, uh,  uh, sell Coke so we can get some.  You know, you cut it up, you get some good stuff, you cut it up, sell it, and then snort  the good stuff or, or smoke it.  And, uh, people would come to the house.  It was like three in the morning, and you get a knock on the door, and there was a guy  standing there once with a big water jug from, you know, water cooler full of pennies. 
[00:18:00]  He's going, dude, man, I don't even know how much is in here, but I know it's more than  you, you're asking for.  And, like, didn't you just say that, like, uh, didn't you say ten minutes ago you're  too scared to do anything, like, go pick up a kilo, but you're selling crack?  Max, I was like, my brother was, this motherfucker's like, I won't pick up a kilo, but I'll sling  rock.  I won't pick it up.  People could die in my house.  No, my, my brother was dealing, and, and, but he was living in the same house, like, I  wouldn't be busted, too.  And we were all doing it.  You know, we were all doing it.  How much did the pennies turn out to be? 
[00:18:30]  It was, I don't know, whatever was in it.  We didn't take it.  As a matter of fact, told the guy, just get the fuck out of here.  You know, bring real money.  That seemed like a pretty sweet deal.  Bring real money.  It might have been more.  It might have been less.  We couldn't do the math.  It's like a jelly bean fucking thing.  How many jelly beans are in here?  It's like Goodwill hunting in that room.  But the paranoia, the paranoia that you would get, there would be people that would come  over and just constantly opening the curtains and going, dude, what, what is that?  What?  Like the constant paranoia.  And then there was, we used to like, our freezer was full of those pretzels that you  put in the oven and nice pretzels. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  But the salt would get on the floor.  And by the end of the night, like three guys would be crawling around with pretzel  salt in the pipe.  Just go, no, man, this, I have no, I dropped this before.  And they're fucking smoking pretzel salt.  It smells so bad.  Like anything, anything white or something that they would pick up off the carpet was  something.  And they would rather smoke it and see if it was a freebase or a Coke.  I was doing Coke and I'm sitting at my mother's house and I don't know where she, I used 
[00:19:30]  to sleep on the floor when she let me in.  And I'm fucking so high on crack and Coke and I'm drinking.  And I think I saw a mouse, right?  So I'm like in my underwear and I put plates of peanut butter around the house because I  thought it was a rat.  And I wanted to sit there and I'm sitting there like, oh, fuck, I'm going to catch a rat in  the house.  You know, I'm just like, I got like a fucking hammer in my hand.  Paranoid of rodents.  Rodents.  And most people it's cops and some people are diddling their girls with holes in a mattress. 
[00:20:00]  That is the best paranoia story I've ever heard.  That's right up there.  Meanwhile, the plate of peanut butter, you fucking hear something on it, you look over,  it's Kevin Smith.  I'm just like, free fucking peanut butter?  What are you doing, man?  This is awesome.  Kevin Smith's in my house.  But he won't eat it, he's just like rubbing the hole in his asshole.  Can you look at this?  Hey, we should take a break.  All right.  I mean, thanks for the listen.  That's some unbelievable shit.  Damn.  Were you ever drunk?  I was never drunk. 
[00:20:30]  Not really, man.  And like weed is the toughest thing I've ever done.  Well, maybe we smoked hash once at Quick Stuff, which is essentially kind of weed.  Hash, yeah.  But I never, never eat extra though, man.  I went through the Coke thing, but nothing too crazy.  I never did that either.  Len Bias, when his heart fucking exploded.  Yeah, that kind of.  I remember reading that in high school, I was like, I'll never touch Coke in my life.  I did it for about two, maybe two years.  And then it got to the point where I was like, this is really bad for you, you know?  And then like years later, like 10 years later, you go into a bar and see somebody that you 
[00:21:00]  used to do Coke with and they're there going like, hey man, what's up?  You want to fucking go in the bathroom?  And their mouth is like grinding away and their eyes are darting back and forth.  And you're like, dude, what?  You're still fucking doing this?  Are you insane?  Yeah.  How are you not?  I could have done it for 10 more fucking years.  Right.  You're like, why'd I quit so early?  I'm such a quitter.  Yeah, Jesus.  The all request Worst Of Show.  Subject the rest of the world to your favorite O&A moments.  Call 877-4-WORST-OV. 
[00:21:30]  877-496-7786.  In the last segment, a caller requested this, this, this.  How you doing?  My name is Andrew and I want to request anything with Kevin Smith, please.  Thank you.  Bye.  Continuing on with that bit, here's part two.  The all request Worst Of Show.  Kevin, we got the phone.  Oh my God.  How did we get the phone?  How did this shit happen?  Where did somebody pull this from? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, we have our ways.  Oh.  I put it on, I douched myself on my blog.  I mean, I haven't written on it in a year.  You see, put this up.  Yeah, yeah.  That and two letters I wrote to girlfriends.  You had a great blog.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You should go back to it.  Creatively, I'm very satisfied here though.  It's kind of hard to write because I'm doing it for five hours a day, but I would write  when we were off the air.  Right.  I did a lot of it.  And, you know, I found, again, I went over this.  And I did go over this, by the way, in fucking red ink and critique it now 20 years later  or whatever, which is what a drivel spewing little jet bag I was. 
[00:22:30]  It's all rhymey.  I like a rhymey poem.  Now, what is Princeton House?  It was a rehab I was in.  And this is...  At age 17?  Yeah.  You know, the old...  Yeah, he gave up at 17.  Oh, really?  I was...  God, everyone leaves such a fucking interesting life.  I got nothing.  Yeah.  Except the fucking huge movie career.  I don't know.  I'll trade you one drippy poem for fucking massive success.  Really?  Wow.  You make some point, Dan.  We were in hold-ups. 
[00:23:00]  And this, by the way, I fucking...  This is what a little cock I was.  I wrote this, and I wanted everybody to see, you know, but I was too embarrassed to show  people, so I left it on someone's bed, and they found it, and they were going around  asking, who wrote this?  Who wrote this?  Oh, you attention-seeking...  Dude, back of my head is now tingling with fucking humiliation.  The humiliation you feel like when your grandmother walks in and you're jerking off in her hamper. 
[00:23:30]  With grandpa.  And, um, I was always trying to start conversations about the poem to get people talking, and  then I finally confessed in group, but by then, they had all lost interest because they  were just done with it.  Yeah, and I kind of give them credit for that.  They were just like, yeah, whatever.  It was me, everybody.  They're like, what?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, yeah, that thing we...  Yeah, poem.  Last week's...  I think the Challenger had blown up by then because that was when the Challenger blew  up, so afterwards I tried to top it with fucking...  Well, who's going to read this?  I'm not. 
[00:24:00]  I think Kevin Smith should read this.  I'll go for it, sir.  Is there any particular inflection that you're looking for?  Here I lay, Princeton House, just staring at the ceiling.  Between these walls, they've taught me how to deal with all my feelings.  Oh!  I think we trashed him between every line.  I don't think so.  I think we should just let it go.  It's one of these rehab things, too.  It's fucking so awful.  Because in rehab, you know, it's one of these, you know, get to your feelings.  What are the roots?  Why are you...  What are you burying to get high?  All right? 
[00:24:30]  And the first...  You're laying in your bed.  You're not thinking that.  You're thinking about why you were touched as a kid and why you're in Princeton House.  But they didn't teach me how to deal with anything.  I drank in the rehab.  Hey, we need...  This is what we need.  We need some sensitive music.  Sensitive music.  And we need Kevin Smith to do the sensitive reading.  I've got a theory that you didn't even need to go to rehab.  You just wanted to go somewhere where you could write poems.  It was your own Walden Woods kind of thing.  It's Spalding Norton.  What song can we play in the background for something like this? 
[00:25:00]  No, do the music from Titanic.  Everybody Hurts.  What?  The Titanic music.  The Titanic theme would be nice.  That's like touching.  Everybody Hurts is pretty good, too, though.  Yeah, but it's hard to do it over the world.  But you're competing, yeah.  How about the Hulk music?  All right.  How about Ann Murray?  I cried at here.  I cried at here.  Huh?  Hulk walking away music might be good.  Back on the road.  David Banner back on the road.  Well, we have instrumental Titanic music?  Fine.  Yeah.  How about the fucking sounds that something makes when it smells like vinegar and water 
[00:25:30]  and it's on a coat hanger in the bathroom?  How about...  Is this good?  This is the old Hulk walking away music.  Let's see if Kevin's feeling it.  Yeah, I'll rock that.  All right.  Here I lay at Princeton House, just staring at the ceiling.  Between these walls, they've taught me how to deal with all my feelings.  Did they?  No.  I hid my pain down deep inside.  I tucked it all away.  The pain it grew, it ate at me. 
[00:26:00]  It killed me day by day.  I feel like I'm 16.  I had a friend, he helped me cope, named Johnny Walker Red.  How fucking hack.  What a booze hack.  If the Johnny Walker Company is listening right now, this is your campaign.  I was the fucking girl fart joke of fucking alcohol.  Help me cope, named Johnny Walker Red.  And then a dame walked in with beautiful stems. 
[00:26:30]  But just when you think, this is ugh, noir.  I could just see it.  Oh, I did question it.  In a fucking ad in a magazine.  There's a picture of Jimmy and it just says, I had a friend, he helped me cope, named Johnny  Walker Red.  A little picture of the bottle at the bottom.  And that was Johnny Walker Black upset you weren't friends with him?  Ah, alright.  It hurt inside to learn the truth.  He'd rather see me dead.  Oh, Johnny turned on.  Yeah, Johnny was a goose.  What kind of fucking friend is that?  Jack Daniels was another one, a so-called friend of mine. 
[00:27:00]  I'd wrap my lips around his neck.  He'd leave me feeling fine.  That's a little homo-orah.  Yeah.  It certainly is.  Jack Daniels, too, had lied to me.  I'd been deceived again.  So I set out in desperate hope to find a loyal friend.  Depressed no more, my spirit soared.  I was no longer sad.  For I soon met a southerner by the name of old granddad.  I like how you're just paying tribute to booze. 
[00:27:30]  Registered rehab, we're all running out and banging dope that night.  Sir, I give it up for your rhyme scheme.  I mean, it's not like iambic pentameter, but you've got a decent rhyme scheme.  Do you know that I have been fucked?  I'm less embarrassed admitting prostitute stories, golden shower stories.  I had a girlfriend piss in a cup and I drank it one time, and this was sober, and I'm less  embarrassed admitting that than hearing this.  A pal of mine.  Was the girl whose name is Johnny Walker Red? 
[00:28:00]  Another friend called Jose Cuervo Tequila.  It helped to dull the pain when I thought about my uncle coming in to feel ya.  Me?  You?  I had that so worked out in my head.  And then when it came out my mouth, I should have wrapped my lips around a Jack Daniels  ball.  He'd let you feel in fine till you realize he wanted you dead.  Then it really hurts.  Why didn't I print one of these?  He'd lead me to the promised land, the road we'd start to pave, but the only road this 
[00:28:30]  bastard knew was a shortcut to the grave.  Wow.  Bastard.  Yeah, that bastard.  There's passion.  I left these friends not knowing, I left these friends not knowing that my end was drawing  near.  Quite cheap, thought I, to leave the rye, the gin, and ever clear.  Wait, wait.  What does that quite cheap mean?  I tell you, well, I actually, it's funny, somebody just brought me a copy of what I wrote  on the blog, and I do call myself out on it.  It's not a fucking, uh...  You do, you do a line-by-line critique. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, great, yeah.  This is like CliffsNotes right here.  Yeah, I see.  Wow, yeah.  This poem, this poem is like two weeks into improv going, yeah, I get it.  I get what they're doing, right?  You know what I mean?  This is like, I get what they're saying to me.  So you wrote the poem like, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is like two weeks in, probably.  This poem is as epic as Paradise Lost.  Well, this is not, this is the poem.  You are Milton at age 17.  That's the poem plus my critique.  I mean, I did go over it with a fine...  He went line for line.  Fine-toothed comb and straightened myself right out.  Dude, you've inspired me. 
[00:29:30]  I'm going to go dig out my fucking high school ramblings and throw it up.  There's something kind of like, I mean, nothing as good as this, I assure you.  I wish I'd saved some of it.  I have it all, sadly.  I think everyone's got a douche chili.  What were you going to say, Rich?  You had something to say.  No, I said, I said, this is like two weeks into rehab where he goes, I got this stuff.  This is where the feelings, everything starts coming out.  Right?  That's why I already said it.  Why did you make me do it again?  No, I really didn't hear you.  I wasn't setting you up that time. 
[00:30:00]  I'd be okay if every day I'd only, I'd stick to only beer.  But I'd been tricked and my disease would look at me and sneer.  Did it?  Did it.  But this social drink, in quotes, made glamorous by commercials on TV would take its toll.  I'd sell my soul.  It was my enemy.  You're blaming the fucking media here?  Do I?  You're blaming a commercial, but this, quote unquote, social drink.  Hey, some people can just have a fucking beer. 
[00:30:30]  Well, maybe if you met a Southerner named Old Grandad.  And if you realized where that bastard wanted to take you.  Made glamorous by commercials on TV, man.  If you don't understand, what's important is the rhyme.  Oh, okay.  I would have said anything.  Like any good writer.  If I would have thought of it, I would have wrote, now I can't laugh.  Tee hee hee hee hee hee.  With you, I'm sure you could have fit in VD.  Yeah, or HIV.  I hadn't any kind of foresight. 
[00:31:00]  I knew not why I couldn't find a friend who'd really help, but then I knew the time was here.  It was time to help myself.  My mind was sick.  My body scarred.  My life was at its low.  But light shined through the Princeton house like fire in the snow.  Ooh, that's evocative.  What's evocative mean?  I can see it.  Fire.  Fire in the snow.  I thought it meant like what happens to stomach acids when you eat fucking six-week-old sushi. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, what a cunt face I am.  I'm happy now.  My life is good, and hope is shining in.  But the worst part of this mad disease is that to surrender means to win.  Sir, I give it up.  Seventeen, that's good.  It stinks.  You're a good man.  Seventeen, sir.  Seventeen.  I wrote a poem at age sixteen called The Princess and the Clown.  You want to talk about gay?  Horrible.  That, at least, there's some depth to it.  And you did keep the rhyme going the whole time. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, that rhyme.  I can't, I'm going to take your breakdown home.  Yeah, I enjoy the breakdown, and it's a blog I have not touched in a long time.  It's jimnorton.blogspot.com.  The first line of the poem is, here I lay at Princeton House, you're staring at the ceiling,  and you write, I suppose the first question would have to be, if I am staring at the ceiling,  how am I writing?  Your breakdown is very funny, Jimmy.  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, and I also break down a fucking letter.  I found a letter that I had written a girl, I, I was dating one girl, and I, well, I say,  I, I, I, I was dating a girl named Michelle, and then we broke up, and I started dating  Debbie, but while I was dating Debbie, I started fucking Michelle again, and Debbie found out,  and I wrote her a note about it, and she left it at my house, which is how I still had it,  it was from eighty-seven or eighty-six or something like that, eighty-seven, and I found  it, like, you know, two years ago, and, ugh, what a fucking cock.  I'm just impressed you were fucking two chicks at the same time.  Well, no, one was done with me, and she was fucking my Jamaican friend, John. 
[00:33:00]  It was true, that's what I had to follow, I remember the last time I fucked her, her  asshole stanked.  That's true, I fucked her doggy style, and her fucking ass reeked.  Hence leading you to Johnny Walker.  It was a fucking, a trip to the grave was preferred to that trip to the mushroom factory.  Hey, uh, Brian in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Um, I know Jay, uh, I used to be a bartender at Dr. Gimpy's, and I drove him home a couple 
[00:33:30]  of times, so back in the day when I-  Jason Mewes?  Sweet.  Yeah.  Were you ever a bartender at Dr. Gimpy's?  No, he is, and he said he drove me home.  Oh, I had a Red Bull second thing, but I don't know if you remember me, but I think-  I think I touched your bung piece once.  I think you guys could do a contest, uh, with Jimmy's poem, uh, to George Thorogood, I Drink  Alone, like a song parody.  You know how he does, he's got the rhyme going?  Yeah, with the booze and the rhyming, yeah.  No, we know.  You know.  There's only so much mileage you can get out of something, sir, and I think that having 
[00:34:00]  Kevin Smith read my drippy fucking horrendous poem was the greatest thing that could have  happened to him.  I might have loved that more than the Joel Siegel argument this morning.  Just because it's like, it's so nice to see that I wasn't alone in being gay.  I was such a pussy.  Jim, did you ever imagine-  At least you had something to talk about, though.  Did you ever imagine you'd write a poem when you were 17 and now you've got Kevin Smith  reading it?  How fucking fantastic is that?  It made it palatable.  It's pretty crazy, right?  Yeah.  Like it matters.  I'll fess up to a stupid thing I did when I was a kid.  I was, I think I was 16 and I was going out with a girl and she broke up with me and 
[00:34:30]  I was like fucking just heartbroken, devastated.  And I, I thought for some reason if I had a broken arm, she'd have sympathy for me.  So I went into the garage and tried to break my arm with a baseball bat and, and just  couldn't, but I couldn't bring up the oomph to really do it.  Yeah.  You always stop.  Like I just stopped.  So I had like this big bruise, but no broken bones.  I mean, at what point did you just sit there and go like, it'd be so much easier to just  jerk off.  Yeah, exactly.  If I just tug one out, I won't care about breaking my arm. 
[00:35:00]  What an ass.  My old man, my old man like had a huge fight with his fucking family when we were growing  up over something my, my uncle did when he was younger.  He broke up with this girl, this girl broke up with him and he wanted to make her feel  bad.  This is taking it back to like late sixties, early seventies.  So he sent her a telegram from my father, you know, from my coming, supposedly coming  from my dad.  My dad knew nothing about it.  And it said, uh, you know, I'm sad to inform you that Wayne died.  Oh, geez.  So the woman or the girl rather calls up my grandmother and she's just like, Oh my God, 
[00:35:30]  Wayne's dead.  And my grandmother's like, Wayne's dead.  And she's like, yes, Don sent me a telegram that Wayne's dead.  And she's like, Don knows Wayne's dead.  And I didn't know.  She calls up my father.  She's like, Wayne's dead.  And my father was like, Wayne's dead.  And she's, she's like, you sent this woman a telegram.  He's like, no, I didn't.  And it finally outed that it was my uncle that did it.  But my grandmother, like almost to her death remained mad at my father.  No shit.  For like a telegram, the dude had nothing to do with. 
[00:36:00]  That's what you do for fucking shit, man.  I know.  You think it's going to change it.  Hi, this is Kevin Smith.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yes, it's one of those days where these two dudes are too fucking lazy coming to work.  So they throw up some old shit that you've heard before.  So please don't call in.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  Hi, Rob.  This is Mark from Iowa.  I was wanting to hear, uh, the old Bernie Getz going crazy in the studio. 
[00:36:30]  Message deleted.  The All Request.  Worst of Show.  Bernie loves the weekly world news.  Yeah.  Hey, can you believe this?  There's an article.  This is a new revelation about history that the Vikings were sissies.  Actually, sissies.  The Vikings were sissies.  And they use that word sissies.  Wow, I don't know if I believe that.  Did you see that one weekly world news where the headline was, Bernie gets to the point?  Well, this is the news. 
[00:37:00]  This is the news I see.  There's a bunch of pictures of dead animals and stuff.  I can't understand what that is.  That's just for shock value.  There's a crossword puzzle.  I wouldn't even know how to do that.  And then other, let's see, nonsense.  Some personal ads.  Six-letter word for Target.  Hey, look, here's something everyone here could learn.  Trip Club Adequate.  Ten essential do's and don'ts.  Okay?  Okay?  Wait, wait.  What was that?  I missed that. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, look.  And there's another...  Oh, so what?  That's it.  And look, here's another article.  The Republicans now, they're fighting for Caucasian History Month.  Oh!  And they show a picture of Donald Trump shouting with Ronald Reagan standing in the background.  I bet you'd be honored during that month.  They want Caucasian History Month.  I would honor you during that month.  Wait, where's that other thing?  I want to hear...  What month is he on the Klan calendar?  This is a new one.  Just hit the newsstands.  They have him shirtless for July.  Wait, was that strip club? 
[00:38:00]  What was the name of that?  Oh, look.  Here's other stuff.  History.  Jesus drove his brother to drink.  It's possible.  Adequate.  Get Craig Christ ready.  That's how we'll end this.  Craig Christ from Stephen Lynch.  This is about vegetarian.  They're showing giant pictures of mutant vegetarian...  Mutant vegetables.  Mutant vegetables.  This is horrible.  Anyway, I'm going to take this home and read it.  Hold on.  Can you go back to the stripper etiquette?  We'll end with stripper etiquette.  Oh, what is there?  You know, you just do nothing.  You know, buy drinks.  Give them...  Put money in their belt. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Say nothing is usually the best thing.  Right.  Just look.  Look and enjoy.  Bernie, would you like to go to a strip club with us?  Nah.  No?  No, why not?  We'll take you out.  Oh, thanks.  That'd be fun.  Nah.  Nah?  Nah.  It's just...  Nah.  Definitely.  Nah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Better porno on the internet.  Gotta get bullets.  So that's the news.  And no news is good news.  Wow, Bernie.  You're safe from the horrible scene.  Definitely easier to shoot a gun and drive a car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Laugh at me.  I'll get out of here.  I'm a good shooter. 
[00:39:00]  Definitely a good shooter.  Definitely a good shooter.  Yeah.  And I want my CD back.  What CD?  That one...  You played one CD of that nice music in the beginning.  Of course, Wapner comes on it.  That was the om.  Yeah.  Remember that om?  You played one music of that?  You played about a minute and a half of that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Goddamn, Bernie.  I love when you come on.  Yeah.  The last love when you come on.  The first 40 minutes were quite boring, but, man, you made up for it.  What are you kidding?  You made up for it for the last 10 minutes.  Well, I didn't mean to. 
[00:39:30]  I thought it was the worst.  What did we learn, Anthony?  That Jesus Christ drove his own brother to drink.  His brother to drink.  His mutants.  Fat chicks make sexy faces sometimes.  Do the first have adequate...  Adequate.  It's easier to shoot a pistol than to drive a car with one hand.  Osma Bin Laden.  Oh, Bernie.  What are you doing, Bernie?  Of Osma.  It's right here.  It's right here.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  No, no, no, no.  You've got to go out of the machine.  Yeah, sit down, Bernie.  It's the thing.  It's right there.  Oh, yeah, sit down.  I'll get it to you.  We're going to say goodbye to you. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  You rule, Bernie.  Bernie.  No.  No.  This one, right?  It says, um, on the front.  Oh.  What are you?  Motherfucker.  Tony.  Oh, Tony.  You're asking for trouble.  Tony.  Oh, he's coming over.  Oh, Bernie.  Bernie, sit down.  Sit down.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  He's really mad.  He's really mad.  You pissed off, Bernie.  All right, get over there.  Get over there.  It's getting hot in here.  It's getting hot in here. 
[00:40:30]  It's getting real hot in here.  Bernie, you don't have to take that.  You don't have to take that, Bernie.  All right, sit down.  Stand up to your right, Bernie.  Sit down, Bernie.  Sit down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay, Paul.  It's okay.  It's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  Paul, it's okay.  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh.  I didn't get that fucking seat.  Oh, yeah.  Hand over that fucking seat. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, you're going to have another.  You lunatic.  Relax.  All right, Bernie.  He's fine, Paul.  You tell him to relax.  Paul, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him.  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Everybody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  I mean.  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep the CD.  I won't be here again.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie's leaving.  Oh, man.  Do you got the CD?  Give him his CD.  You ruined it.  Bring him back in.  Give him his CD.  No, we'll explain what happened.  We'll explain what happened.  Bring him back in. 
[00:41:30]  Bernie.  Come.  Oh, he's going into his back.  Holy shit.  He's going into his back.  No, he's at Bernie.  It's okay.  He's zipping up.  Bernie, we got the CD.  We got the CD.  Bernie.  Oh, he's pissed.  Oh, my God.  He's running out.  Wait, follow him out with the cell phone.  Make sure he knows we never.  It was a fake CD.  No, follow him out with the cell phone.  Obi took a fake.  It wasn't his CD.  Oh, it wasn't his CD?  No, of course not.  And he lost his mind.  Of course not.  Did you get him in the CD?  Lord, I think we saw some of that rage.  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it. 
[00:42:00]  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV where the guy finally snaps from the  stand.  The lawyer cracks him.  All right, I did it.  See?  All right, hold on.  I think...  And I'm not sorry.  I'd do it again.  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Jesus.  Bernie, there's your CD right there.  Okay, thank you.  That's not the one he...  Relax, that's not the one.  That's yours.  Tell him...  That's the one he used in the studio.  Eric, explain.  Explain what we do.  Bernie, the joke, he had another CD.  Whatever.  It was a separate CD. 
[00:42:30]  Sure?  It was totally...  Take a look at it.  It's not even broken or damaged.  Anyway, it's okay.  Why don't you relax?  Why don't you relax?  No, no, no.  I want to go...  It's 9 o'clock.  They want to go home anyway.  They still want to call to you.  Go back inside and at least...  Let's not burn bridges.  Let's go back in.  Come back in and talk to you.  He's coming in.  Nice to meet you.  Wait, that sounds scary.  He's coming in.  They just want to talk to you.  I hope he's building a barrier.  All right, Bernie.  All right, wait.  Sit down, sit down.  Sit down, sit down.  No, it's 9 o'clock.  Bernie, let me explain what happened, though, Bernie. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know how to explain what happened.  Wait, put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  Yeah.  Because I don't explain.  Because we really like you.  We want you to be a friend of the show.  I love Bernie Getz, and I don't want to get off on the wrong foot here.  We felt like...  Here.  I'm listening.  All right, we felt like you were a friend of the show, that we could pull one of our  gags on you.  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Here's the...  Wait here.  I'm going to show you.  Calm down.  Here's the CD I was smashing.  Okay, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Here's...  The CD I was smashing was called Haunted Pussy.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  It had nothing to do with the one that...  You were smashing Haunted Pussy! 
[00:43:30]  You're smashing that guy!  Bernie, I never touched your CD.  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in, and, you know, made the old switcheroo.  Bernie, we're still pals?  Things are okay.  All right.  Things are okay.  But I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  A friend of mine.  I consider you...  Or okay, or just, or whatever.  Bernie, look at your CD.  You think we're okay.  Bernie does not like...  It's okay.  Look at your CD.  There's not a scratch on it.  I didn't smash you.  I trust you.  All right?  Okay.  Don't look at it.  I thought we were at that stage in our friendship that we could pull one of our gags on you. 
[00:44:00]  That's all.  Well, I didn't smash your CD, though.  It's like...  I mean, it wasn't as bad as what if someone took your kid and said,  I'm hanging your kid out the window like Michael Jackson.  Well, there you go.  That's it.  I know.  That's not that bad.  It's only a CD.  All right, Bernie.  So we're cool.  We're cool.  And anyway, that's the news for the week.  Thank you, Bernie.  Okay.  Very good.  Bernie gets everybody.  Now that everybody knows what's happening in the world, you know...  I hear you.  And it's...  All right.  It's up a...  Phew!  Yeah, that was cool in the gang. 
[00:44:30]  That was intense.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now I know what those guys felt on that subway.  I'll tell you that much.  Just all night and day, the way he could turn it on...  Yeah.  He really turned it on.  Oh, what a quick fuse.  That's not a slow burn.  You taking the subway home?  Everything's cool, Bernie.  Everything's open.  Shut the fuck up!  We're going to be like little Fonzies.  And what's Fonzie, Bernie?  I don't know.  Cool.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  That's okay.  Yeah, Bernie, we didn't watch you...  We didn't watch you... 
[00:45:00]  It's going to be a mild winter.  Mild winter.  We didn't watch you going away mad.  Mild winter.  All right.  Is that yours?  Oh, you dropped something, Bernie?  All right.  There you go.  Okay.  That looks like the same Steve jacket he was probably wearing back.  Okay, guys.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Bernie.  Thank you.  Bernie, guys.  We'll talk to you again soon.  Is this Bernie?  Is this yours?  Holy ass.  No, no.  All right.  It's...  Yeah.  Did I get him?  Yes, you did.  He was coming back in.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  That was the rage. 
[00:45:30]  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  We saw it.  Yeah.  Eric was in between me and Bernie, and I got to give Eric a lot of credit, man.  He was holding him back.  He was out of his mind.  You know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man, and when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was  kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go, it's not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport, he just like, ah, just lost his mind.  That's what we saw. 
[00:46:00]  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster, and a little smoke billed up, and he couldn't  handle it.  Right.  Imagine that, though.  No, but you didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just walked.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I have. 
[00:46:30]  Look at me.  I'm still shaking.  I am shaking.  Dude, you had a pissed Bernie gets right here in your face.  And there's no reasoning with him when he's that mad.  You can't reason with him.  No.  No.  He just walked out.  Yeah.  He was convinced you smashed that CD of his.  That was one of his things.  You see how he was looking for it before you made Like You Smashed It?  He came over to Opie's area, looked through those CDs that Opie's got in front of him,  going, there was a CD.  I have it.  Because he needs to know where everything is. 
[00:47:00]  Very particular.  Yeah.  Or there's something wrong with him in the world.  Yeah.  And then he sat back down.  You told him that the CD you had in your hand was the CD in question.  When you started smashing it, the look on his face, that's when he snapped.  Keep your fucking CD.  Rawr.  Wow.  Eric, is he all right?  He's gone.  Eric, you, I have to tell you, you rock.  No problem.  Eric got in between me and Bernie.  Bernie was literally like, what?  He kept kneeing me in the legs. 
[00:47:30]  I'm like, stop.  He's like, give me my CD, my CD.  And I'm sitting there with this hand, trying to cover his real CD so he doesn't see it.  And Opie's just sitting there going, oh my God.  Look at that.  Could you imagine if he's got to go on the subway right now?  Oh.  Some black guy is in his seat or something?  Oh, forget it.  With an iPod?  Disrespecting CDs?  All right.  Bernie, what's the matter?  Hot water burn baby.  Hot water burn baby.  Fucking psychopath.  Why don't we take a break? 
[00:48:00]  We have Billy Burr in studio.  And that's the news for today.  Keep your fucking CD.  I pushed the CD in the case.  It does this when it's told.  It does this when it's told.  And you want your CD, Bernie?  Would you?  Wait a minute.  Would you say a great big black person?  No, we're going to do that.  Let's see the, uh, was that track 14?  Wow.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Billy Burr in studio, like I said.  Fine.  Keep your fucking CD.  But first, you know, Bernie Getz was talking about how Jesus Christ, you know, drove his 
[00:48:30]  own brother to drink.  He was.  I forgot everything that happened before that snap.  It's just a segue.  Yeah, bud.  Just a segue.  Huh?  The heart rate's still up.  I know.  Oh, that was really, like, exciting.  Poe came in here with the, he was the second most crazy person in this room.  That look in his eyes.  And he went to grab Bernie, and Bernie was, like, pissed.  Everyone was just out of their minds. 
[00:49:00]  Poe was in the other room, calming down, doing his little.  Oh, doing his calm down procedure.  Did they get video of that?  Uh, yeah, we have it all.  Danny was in here the whole time?  Yep, you stayed right there with the camera.  Oh, nice.  Get Danny in here.  I got to see how the video looks.  Did Poe make a wrong turn and go into the production studio first before he came in here?  I don't know what happened.  But did he know the directions to get here, to this studio?  The problem is, in his office, there's a delay, so he was hearing it late.  Oh.  Wow.  Hot in here.  Yeah, he heard the eye.  Oh, it's getting hot.  It looks like rain.  Oh, it certainly looks like rain tonight. 
[00:49:30]  John.  Yo.  Hey.  So, how fucking crazy are you to piss off Bernie Katz in the goddamn studio?  Yeah, that's not smart.  Yeah, I hope he's an idiot.  Ed Asner's one thing, he's 80.  Yeah, what's Ed Asner gonna do?  And Ed has never shot anyone.  Exactly.  It's not like it's Psycho Patty or anything, man.  Wow, yeah.  Dude, I never expected him to go like that.  I thought he'd get a little pissed off and bummed out. 
[00:50:00]  I never expected him to lose his mind like he did.  All right.  All right, thank you.  Master Poe, you all right?  No, no.  I'm gonna talk to Marcelino and I'm gonna find out.  What?  What's up?  What's up?  I want to get a patch directly into my room because this delay is no good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's why.  15 seconds of...  Yeah.  All right.  My heart is...  It's all good, bro.  You did great.  You did great.  It's good.  But I'm gonna get a patch.  What do you do to calm down, Poe?  I heard like you just kind of sit... 
[00:50:30]  Poe is pissed off now, too.  Poe is freaking right now.  Nothing was gonna happen.  If it came down to it, all of us would have piled on Bernie.  We just didn't want to go there.  That's all.  He is what they call in the zone right now.  Well, plus, there's not many problems in the studio.  So when there is one, you're the security guy.  You don't want to not be there.  15-second delay, a lot can happen.  I'm sure that he shot those four guys in a lot less than 15 seconds on that subway.  Bernie can do a lot of damage.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know, no one's hearing it.  No one hears...  Yeah, the security guy, 15 seconds after the fact. 
[00:51:00]  He's hearing what's going on.  We'll get him a direct patch.  This is what we do, though.  We create major havoc, and the only ones that are enjoying it are you and I.  Oh, yeah.  Poe's pissed.  Everyone's freaked.  Why do you say we?  There's one problem in the studio.  There's one fucking irritant constantly hurting and annoying guests.  Poking and prodding a Bernie guest always.  But I'm saying, you guys enjoy it, though.  Yes.  Of course.  It was incredible.  Who else was freaked out when he was running for his bags?  Bernie's driving on his way to a pawn shop right now. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  Todd from California.  That man wants to be the mayor?  I know.  Jesus.  We might have wrecked his whole campaign.  I hope he'd be the guy if we had Ted Bundy as a guest.  Let's get some girls in here naked.  Come on.  Bring in the nude girls.  They could give them a laugh dance.  A wading pool full of mud and a 12-year-old.  Ted, here.  Hold this blunt object.  Now bring in the girls. 
[00:52:00]  They're all whores, aren't they, Ted?  Come on in, ladies.  Yeah, these girls were bringing in their filthy whores, Ted.  Here's a bat.  We got Ted Bundy audio?  Yeah, that's when he's having sex with his girlfriend.  He's telling her to lay there and pretend she's dead.  What's that from?  The movie.  Oh, the movie.  Oh, the movie.  Which one was that?  Who played him in that one?  Mark Harmon.  Was it Mark Harmon?  Yeah.  That was a good one.  I liked the Mark Harmon, Ted Bundy.  All right.  Why don't we play Craig Christ?  Or Ted Bundy, as Bernie would call him. 
[00:52:30]  Did he get one name right?  Al Bundy.  Martin Scorsese.  What did he say?  Raji.  That was my favorite one.  Raji Dane.  Raji Dangerfield.  Oh, you're a very dangerous man.  Bernie Gates.  Raji.  Now I keep your fucking dick.  He ran right over, pointing.  Oh, he was.  Oh, was he mad?  He was the irate white man.  He was fucking angry.  Michael Douglas falling down.  Right, falling down.  That was it.  Bernie Gates falling down.  I'm like you, man. 
[00:53:00]  God damn.  I'm just like you.  That's every thug's worst nightmare is some bespectacled guy with a pistol who gets mad that fucking quickly.  Looks like the mild-mannered Easy Mark.  Yeah.  And he just loses his mind.  When he went out and grabbed his bag, his black bag, and put it up on the file cabinet,  I'm like, oh my God, here it comes.  Here it comes.  We're getting the best publicity we've ever had.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  As much as I'd hate to see Opie get shot, what that would do for fucking gigs for the next year. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, forget about it.  Every radio station in the country would want you on.  That would be huge.  If you pulled through, his record isn't that good.  You know, he shot four guys and none of them died, so you'd probably live.  So much for that vegetarian angle he has.  Yeah, so much for the vegetarians making you mellow.  Jesus Christ.  Have another piece of broccoli and I'll take some asparagus and...  You're the fucking CD.  You're the fucking CD. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  Enough about the friggin' soy milk and broccoli and soybeans.  Wow.  That was great that we really got to see him do his thing.  No one gives a shit about him running for office.  No.  We want to see you snap.  We want to see you snap.  And go into a murderous rage.  That's what we wanted to...  That was it right there.  It took four hours.  We wanted to see that.  Four hours of horrible news.  Four hours.  It took four or five appearances.  Yeah, he's actually been on our show about four times, so it took that long to actually make 
[00:54:30]  him snap.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Chris.  What's up, man?  Oh, hey.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, man.  The best part of that whole shit was as soon as you hear the CD break, you hear Bernie Gats  go, you motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You motherfucker.  He was pissed.  I hear him snappy.  Is there any way to pull that audio?  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I want to know what you think he would actually have done if he actually had gotten  to Opie. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  He probably would have hit him.  He probably would have hit him.  Yeah, I didn't want him to get to that point, so I used poor Eric as a blocker.  He would have hit you for disrespecting him.  He used lethal force last time.  Would he have dunked his thumbs into your eyeballs?  That guy would use the gun at a giraffe.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think he's...  He doesn't strike me as a grappler.  No, no, no.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Maybe a bitch slap.  I saw him walking down the street looking like a raving lunatic.  He had a shovel, and he was talking about Vermont.  I don't know what that meant. 
[00:55:30]  It's where he's buried, by the way.  It's where he buried his gun.  All right.  It's still there somewhere.  All right.  Well.  Whew.  All right.  We'll do a...  A lot of people are saying don't lose Bernie as a friend of the show.  No, we won't.  No, he'll be back.  No one else is going to let him talk for an hour about nothing.  Of course.  No one who has advertisers to answer to would allow that nonsense.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  Um, Colin, this is Shitzilla, Colin from Albuquerque. 
[00:56:00]  Want to request a worst of, going back from a few years ago.  It involved Anthony and Patrice as they decided to go take the radio show onto the streets to  hail a cab.  I would be really appreciated if you guys could get that on from me for some of the pests.  And, uh, one more thing.  Bobo, I hate you.  And I hope you bleed out from shaving your pathetic red rocket. 
[00:56:30]  See you, boys.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Message deleted.  People request worst of show.  Sir, I'm doing a radio show, but at any time that...  Where are you?  What do you got?  It's a real...  For your collection.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.  Take off your hat, Ann.  I cannot wear a Nazi helmet.  First of all...  The whole way.  That has fucking Hitler's...  Got the guy's name in it and everything.  Hitler's hair is in that motherfucker. 
[00:57:00]  You're going to swap me at, like, 30...  Wait, wait, wait.  Your mic's clapping out.  Hold on.  Sorry.  I hope you get World War II lice.  Oh, no, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  I'll walk...  I'll do the walk with my, um...  With my Nazi helmet on.  This is the real thing?  That's the real deal, yeah.  I got it.  It swapped me, like, 30 years ago.  Wow.  I got the guy's name in the helmet.  Motherfucker, I smell Cyclone B in it.  It's just a hat.  What's the matter?  It's just a hat, right? 
[00:57:30]  Good for you.  Hey, let him walk ahead.  I hope you get Third Reich itch, motherfucker, for wearing some strange Nazi hat.  Hey, Patrice, let him walk ahead.  There's Nazi lice in the helmet.  Yeah, see, look.  Brotherhood.  It's a brotherhood.  Wow.  You're crazy, Ed.  You're crazy.  How you doing?  What's happening, baby?  How you doing?  Look at the cops are stopping and going...  There's swastika on a helmet. 
[00:58:00]  I know there's a little swastika on the side.  Come on.  It's not like a Mel Gibson or nothing.  Oh, my God.  Did he give you that hat?  Yeah.  That's fucking genius.  Wow.  This I'll take home to my neighborhood.  They'll love it.  I'll put it on the mantle.  Where's this racist motherfucker at?  Do you got lampshades, too, you dick?  You what?  I actually had to use it as a helmet one day.  For what?  I was out with my friend the night before.  I left my helmet in his car and I had to get to work.  The only way was to use that.  Well, that's fantastic. 
[00:58:30]  Anthony?  Is anyone in New York even noticing or caring that I'm wearing a Nazi helmet?  That's the beauty of New York City.  Not one look.  No one really cares.  No one cares.  Not one look as you wear the Nazi helmet to XM.  How you doing?  Anthony, you've got to mow your lawn with that hat on.  Should I mow my lawn in my neighborhood?  Well, let me look at the reflection.  This is really...  Holy shit.  Oh, is that awful?  No shit.  He's going to bring him up.  Oh, is that horrible? 
[00:59:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  Guten Tag.  Wow, they're all just bothered.  All these people are bothered because we've got a big crowd today.  We're blocking the way as we walk.  We are the niggas.  Not one person has noticed that he's wearing that.  No, no one really...  It's New York, so...  Yeah.  No one really cares.  Isn't that amazing?  No one even looking.  No one is looking twice.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Anthony, do this. 
[00:59:30]  Hey, Anthony, wait.  Thank you, sir.  Give somebody the mic.  He's just walking away.  He gave you a World War II helmet and you're walking away.  Isn't that great?  Hey, listen.  Give somebody the mic, right?  And just walk without being...  Without everybody.  Just cross the street without everybody and see if anybody noticed you have a fucking  Nazi hat on.  Yeah.  Just cross the street, Anthony, and see if anybody...  Because no one's looking because there's too many fucking people around.  Go this way.  Go that way.  Let Anthony go by himself.  Just let him go by himself. 
[01:00:00]  There he goes.  Let him go by himself, camera guy.  Okay, so the camera follows.  Well, he has to walk by himself.  But everyone just looks down.  They don't notice crap in New York City.  He has a fucking Nazi helmet on.  One day we've got to get something.  I got a chuckle out of an old guy who kind of looked like, what the fuck?  Because he almost called you...  Hey, what's happening now?  Remember you?  Hey, man.  Hey, one day we got to have someone just walk completely naked to see if these people notice  anything.  They don't notice naked. 
[01:00:30]  You think they'll notice naked?  They don't notice naked, but not Nazi hat.  Oh, this lady noticed a Nazi hat.  Uh-oh.  She looks like Wiesenthal's daughter.  Oh, my God.  That is not right.  He's just walking across the street with the Nazi helmet on with, yes, the logo on the  side that needs to be covered up with a wow sticker or something, because that's not right.  Get the Yankee emblem on that damn thing, quick.  Put the Yankee emblem... 
[01:01:00]  I'm trying to find, like, Jewish people, because I figured they would probably be the most offended.  All right, let's go to Pickabagel.  Let's go to Pickabagel.  We'll get some stairs in there.  Wouldn't that be weird if I ordered a bagel with a little schmear?  Oh, hey, hey, Anthony.  Bust up, bust up.  Hey, Anthony, hail a cab.  Anthony, hail a cab.  Hail a cab.  Wait a minute. 
[01:01:30]  Go on.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey.  Anthony, hail a cab.  Hail a cab.  Hail a cab.  Here's one coming.  Here's one coming right now.  All right, watch.  This is a photo op for everybody.  Hey, the guy stopped.  He kept going.  Shit, I got to hail a cab.  All right, get over there.  Right over there.  Oh, my God, no.  This is not right.  The cab is stopping.  Get in.  Get in.  Get in. 
[01:02:00]  Get in.  Get in.  Ant, you got to get in one of these.  Where am I going?  Just go to half a block and give the guy five bucks.  All right.  All right.  Anthony's going to hail a cab to the...  All right, I got to hail a cab to XM.  I need a cab.  All right.  We got cabs coming this way.  All right, here comes one.  Oh, he's turning.  Shit.  All right, get your cameras out.  This is going to be a photo op.  Anthony hailing a cab to XM.  There's Anthony. 
[01:02:30]  That's not right.  That is so not right.  No, you got to wait.  Oh, here's one.  Here's one.  Here it is.  Here it is.  And make sure you get in.  You got to get in.  You got to get in.  All right, get in.  Get in, Ant.  Get in.  All right, we'll see you, Anthony, at XM.  He has hailed a cab with his Nazi helmet on.  And there goes Anthony.  Take me to Berlin.  That's pretty fucking funny, man. 
[01:03:00]  That is fucking hilarious.  Hailing a cab was genius.  We know you came up with it.  Steve.  You get the other one?  That was jumping in.  Wait till you see these pictures on opiananthony.com.  Holy crap.  And you know Arabs are pulling over with that shit.  They're like, hell yeah.  One of the best walkovers ever.  Anthony and a Nazi hailing a cab.  That's not right.  Oh, shit. 
[01:03:30]  Where is he?  Do they let him out or is he up the street?  How do they have this kid dressed?  Holy shit.  Wow, wow, wow.  All right.  Where is he?  He took that fucking cab.  Do they take him away?  I'm going to Berlin.  I'm going to Berlin.  He's way up the sidewalk.  That helmet is genius. 
[01:04:00]  That fucking guy gave him an official World War II helmet, man.  Yeah.  It's the real deal.  Where is that guy?  He left?  He left.  Yeah, he just took a left turn and left.  All right, Anthony's making his way back up the sidewalk here.  Anthony, genius.  That cab driver was laughing his ass off.  Oh, man.  How awful.  A couple didn't want to pick me up. 
[01:04:30]  I wonder why.  Goddamn.  Whose idea was that?  Steve.  Steve.  Is that Steve?  Got to give credit where credit's due, man.  Hail a cab.  Everyone left.  So it looks like they're going to be outside for this.  Yeah.  Are we going to do this?  Yeah.  Patrice, I thought you were getting your gold on.  You're getting your bling on.  Oh, you just have to pull it out from his shirt.  Stupid white boy that I am. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, my God.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  We're going to attempt.  All that was hidden?  Oh, my God.  We're going to attempt nigger versus Nazi.  The nigger Nazi cab challenge.  The nigger Nazi cab challenge 2006.  I will be putting on a Nazi helmet and trying to hail a cab with the Sigh Heil arm.  Don't you got that other thing that the guy gave you yesterday from Pittsburgh? 
[01:05:30]  What thing is that?  What was it?  The, uh...  Huh?  Oh, the...  The what?  It was like a...  A hazmat.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is like olive drab, isn't it?  I don't know.  No, I think you and just the helmet.  Just the helmet?  Yeah, that might save our jobs.  Because we'll say, look, he was just acting silly.  It's a helmet.  Someone gave me.  It's silly.  It's silly.  And, uh...  And I'll try to hail the cab.  Patrice will be before me in traffic.  Right.  So the cab...  So the cab...  The cab will get first dibs at Patrice. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  If he passes Patrice and picks up me, the Nazi, uh, then there's a problem.  And we want to do best, uh, best out of five?  Best out of five.  Or best out of seven.  I like the higher the better.  We'll see how it goes.  We could go NBA rules.  Want to go NBA?  NBA finals?  We'll see how it goes.  All right.  Oh, crap.  No, Dan.  Jesus Christ.  Will you hide that immediately?  What is wrong with you?  That is a giant flag with a swastika on it.  You should tie that around your neck like a cape. 
[01:06:30]  A cape.  Put it on me like a cape.  Let's see how it would look at least.  Anthony, you've got to tie that around your neck.  You know, I was thinking I might want to run for office at some point in my life, but...  No, you're not.  No, no.  Your sex with Sam wrecked that.  Because when we blow up our careers again, Anthony's going to go into the, uh, the professional  talk show world.  That's okay.  I'm going to...  He's going to be like the next Sean Hannity.  You watch.  But I'm going to be like, yeah, I'm going to do it.  Bob Grant or something.  Or the next O'Reilly or something.  So this is fine.  It's purely acceptable. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  In that genre.  Yeah, I don't know if I could wear the, um, the big flag as a...  No, the helmet's good enough, trust me.  As a cape.  Okay.  You look so silly.  The cape's juicator.  And you'll be doing the move, so you'll be all right.  Yeah, I'll be doing the move.  Yeah.  All right, want to do this one?  Are we going to stand on the same side of the street?  Yeah, we've got to be same side of the street.  You get the cab coming toward you first, though.  Because you've got to be the guy that they pass up for me.  Because everybody knows how hard it is for a black guy to get a cab in New York City. 
[01:07:30]  Okay.  Because they always think you want to go uptown and, uh, jack them.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to go on 6th Avenue, too.  We've got to do it on 6th Avenue.  We've got to do it on 6th.  I was thinking 57th.  Right there out in front.  Oh, um, no, 6th because, 6th because, um...  It's heading north.  Yeah, they think that I'm going uptown.  It's heading north.  They think you're going up.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Because going, I, I, I'm just telling you...  That might give Anthony an unfair advantage.  I'm giving the field, the field research I'm saying is that when I'm going down, when I'm 
[01:08:00]  pointing down at a certain, at a certain, um, level in terms of, like, 60th and I'm going  down, they tend to pick me up because they think I'm not going...  I'm staying in Manhattan.  And then you tell the cabbie, you, you turn it, motherfucker.  And I go, I'm going to the Bronx, bitch!  You trick him.  You fucked up.  You trick him.  I'm just thinking if they see me on 6th over there, they might think, uh, I just work  at, like, Jekyll and Hyde's or something.  Fucking Patrice probably...  They kind of have that kind of stuff over there, don't they? 
[01:08:30]  Fucking Pat...  I didn't...  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I didn't hear you yet.  I was just thinking, fucking Patrice probably puts, like, the Knicks jersey on, the Knicks cap,  heads, like, makes it look like he's heading toward Madison Square Garden  for the big game and all of a sudden he's like, I'm going to the Bronx.  With a big foam number one finger?  As soon as you get in, you're like, fuck that.  Fuck you, bitch!  I'm going to the Bronx.  So people betting out there?  Uh, yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, well, they're more paranoid than anything.  Yeah, people are scared.  They should wear the mustache.  Oh, the mustache.  All right.  Are we going to do this or what?  Let's go.  Yeah, I think we should.  Where's Anthony?  I just saw a picture of us go by on the bus.  Oh, really?  They're going to be ripping those down soon.  Where are you, Ant?  I'm, uh, down right in front of the, um...  Okay.  ...the doorway.  I'm in the elevator.  Waiting to, uh, for you to come down so you could observe. 
[01:09:30]  Give a little play-by-play.  Um, I am, uh, out here with Patrice, who has, uh, turned his hat a little sideways.  He was practicing how he's going to hail the cab in the mirror in the elevator,  and in very intimidating fashion.  It barely looks like he's, uh, doing anything.  Um, it looks like he's going to, uh, rob the...  Oh, sorry, I'm distracted.  The guy is kicking us out of the doorway.  My God. 
[01:10:00]  You'd think a Nazi could stand in a doorway of a building here in a free nation  like the United States of America.  So we're going to, we're going to go...  Yeah, we're going to go...  You're going to have to be first, and I'll be, I'll probably be, like, right here.  So we're going to do it here, or we're going to do it on the 6th Ave?  I think, I think we should just do it here.  Yeah.  Um...  Yeah, see, there, there goes the cab.  There's a lot of cabs available, which is good.  But you should go down a little further.  And then, uh, we have to put our mics down, and Opie will describe the scene. 
[01:10:30]  Because we don't want them to look like, uh, the cabs to think that, uh, this is some kind of ruse or something.  Well, these people...  These people are going to wreck it.  They've got to stay up here.  Yeah, tell them to...  Come this way, Andy.  Yeah, you guys stay up here, please.  All right, we're going down.  You go down by the corner a little bit, Patrice, and I'll stand kind of by the phone booth.  All right, we're setting this up.  What are we doing?  Best of seven?  Yeah, best of seven.  Best of seven.  All right, best of seven.  Hold your mic down. 
[01:11:00]  Anthony, if you're just holding it.  What?  Just so I can get some kind of, uh, sound from you guys.  Just kind of have the mics held by the front of you.  You've got to be a little bit closer to me so he can see you.  He can't see you from there.  Yeah, oh, he'll see me, though.  He'll see me.  All right, I'm going to sit on the planter here.  Wait in.  Yeah, yeah.  Here comes a bus.  After the bus passes, game on.  And I think you need to be a little closer.  I think you need to be where the bus is after the bus passes.  Yeah, you've got to be closer to me. 
[01:11:30]  Because the cab has to see both of you at the same time.  All right.  And then make that decision.  Because it's almost weird close.  Closer, like close.  Yeah, close.  Like where this fucking, like here.  No, not, well, then they're going to think that you're both, uh, together.  Yeah, yeah.  I like this distance.  I would never pick up a nigga and a Nazi.  All right, for you at home, these guys are like a bus length apart.  Yeah.  You got, uh, Patrice all ghettoed out.  Patrice, you look downright scary. 
[01:12:00]  All right, the second this thing, uh, goes by, now we've got to start.  And Anthony with his Nazi helmet.  Game on.  As soon as that light, uh, turns green, uh, game on, yes.  Stand, stand like this.  All right.  Uh, Patrice has his arm up.  Ant, get your arm up.  Thank you, sir.  Hold on, hold on.  All right, there's a cab.  He's confused.  He's stopped.  He has passed.  He has passed.  Oh, Nazi.  Nazi.  Fucking. 
[01:12:30]  Why didn't you, why didn't you, why didn't you, why didn't you pick up, pick up the African  gentleman?  You motherfucker.  I stopped.  You see me, I stopped.  You didn't stop for a nigga.  You stopped to pick up the African gentleman.  Uh, but, but then you put, you, you see that I, I'm a Nazi.  You didn't stop for the Nazi.  You picked up a Nazi over a nigga.  I stopped.  I stopped.  And you see me stopping, right?  I stopped.  And I see maybe.  You chose the Nazi, brother.  You chose Nazi over nigga.  You chose the Nazi, brother.  Wow.  Come on, brother. 
[01:13:00]  You don't pick up a fucking Nazi.  All right, Patrice.  Come here.  Come here.  I got to tell everyone what happened at home.  I'm the eyes of this thing.  So, so they're like a bus length apart.  Patrice, it's so obvious Patrice is hailing the cab.  The guy slows down, keeps looking at Patrice, not sure what to do.  He's thinking, well, I need a fare today.  Then he looks ahead and sees Anthony and he speeds up and picks up Anthony.  Unbelievable.  One for Anthony.  One for me.  None for Patrice.  One for the Nazi.  All right, let's get back. 
[01:13:30]  Son of a bitch nigga to pick up a fucking Nazi in this street.  One for the Nazi.  One for the Nazi.  All right.  All right, nigga, go and get a cab.  Let's see how this goes next.  Nazi one, shwuggy zero.  All right, here comes another cab.  Here comes another cab.  Start hailing at the same time, guys.  All right, here's the cab.  He's slowing down.  And he has picked up Patrice.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Talk to the brother.  I thought he was going to pass him.  I thought he was going to pass him.  Thanks for stopping, man.  Appreciate that.  Listen, there's a Nazi that needs a cab right there. 
[01:14:00]  No picking up.  No picking up Nazi.  All right, all right.  Two brothers, too.  We're tied.  We're tied.  Two black guys.  All right, we're tied.  Shwuggy one, Nazi one.  All right, best of seven.  Here comes another cab.  Oh, my God.  The cab sped by both of you all.  He didn't want either.  I had my mic up, too.  That might do it.  Hey, I need a cab.  He passed both of you. 
[01:14:30]  This guy's turning.  Here we go.  All right, here comes another cab.  You guys got to, like, hail the cab at the exact same time.  All right, their arms are up.  We got Patrice.  We got Anthony.  Oh, look at that.  That's two.  Damn it.  Two to one.  Two to one.  Damn it.  Two to one.  They know Danny Glover.  This is because of Danny Glover.  This is all Danny Glover's fault.  Where's a Nazi supposed to get a cab?  All right, Shwuggy two, Nazi one.  And you got to get a little closer.  You're a little too far away now. 
[01:15:00]  A little further.  All right, here we go.  All right, here we go.  Right there.  That's good.  Stand in the street, Anthony, like you really need it.  I'm going to be kind of like.  All right.  All right.  When the light changes, we got a couple of cabs coming up.  Oh, here comes one.  All right, here comes one.  Let's see what happens.  And.  Oh, man, now it's a runaway.  Now, well, well, the cab is kind of in the middle.  Ask the cabbie who he wants to pick up.  He doesn't know what to do.  Wait, now he's pushing toward Anthony. 
[01:15:30]  Who do you want to pick up, sir?  Whoever comes, you're the first to know.  Yeah.  I need the cab, man.  Is it the nigger or the Nazi?  Whoever comes first to know.  Whoever comes first to know.  You kind of hedged your bet.  Nah, he.  Let me tell you something.  This gentleman hedged his bet and pulled right between both of us.  What is that, a tie?  And then he kind of pushed toward Anthony.  I don't know.  Patrice has two, right?  I got one.  I say.  And that's a tie.  I don't know.  He started pushing past Patrice. 
[01:16:00]  He really did slowly start passing Patrice.  Well, you might have to give it to the Nazi.  If I'm the official judge.  I think it's two.  Yeah.  And my helpers here are saying thumbs up to the Nazi.  He made an excuse that he was like, whichever.  He was ready to pick up Patrice.  Then he saw you.  Then he hedged his bet.  But then he started inching toward you because I think he didn't want to get in trouble.  This is the tiebreaker, right?  We're going to seven, though.  Best of seven.  We got two for the Shruggy.  And two for the Nazi.  All right.  All right.  We're waiting for the next cab. 
[01:16:30]  Outside XM Satellite Radio.  This guy.  You're trying to figure out what's going on?  You figured it out finally?  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's another cab.  I don't think.  No, he's got people.  He's got people.  Oh, he's got people in there.  All right.  We're waiting.  Two for the Shruggy.  Two for the Nazi.  Patrice is loving this.  And you've got to be a little more aggressive because.  You've got to be aggressive.  And you've got to.  Anthony, move closer a little bit.  There you go.  Right about there. 
[01:17:00]  And get in the street a bit.  There you go.  This is definitely fair.  You've got to be trying to get the cab in.  He is.  He is.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  All right.  Wait for the bus to pass.  Wait for the bus.  Game off.  Alvita, Zane.  It's two to two.  It's two to two.  Two cabs have passed by to pick up the Nazi.  Danny Glover is going to be pissed if I win this.  Where's Danny Glover from this bitch?  Hold on. 
[01:17:30]  We're waiting for the bus to pass.  Hold on.  All right.  There it goes.  Hold on.  Let this cab go by because they're letting people out.  Yeah, they're letting people out.  We've got to keep this fair.  Let them go.  Let them go.  All right, Anthony.  Get back in the street.  All right.  Game back on.  Game on.  Will the cabbie pick up a shwibby or a Nazi?  All right.  We're waiting for a cab.  Don't see nothing. 
[01:18:00]  Now, the light's red.  When it turns green, we'll get a few people, a few cabs driving.  Yeah.  I cannot believe it's two up.  It is two up.  God damn, another bus turning over here.  You better not be stopping.  Oh, I'm trying to catch a cab.  She's trying to catch a cab, sir.  It's a little tough.  Hey, what the hell is this guy doing?  All right.  Hold on with the bus.  Just bust out of here.  You're ruining our bit.  They're letting someone out.  Letting people off. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  That's all right.  God damn public transportation.  That's all right.  We're killing time anyway.  That's good.  If you're just tuning in, we're trying to see if a cab will stop for a shwiggy or a  Nazi.  People are very threatened by Patrice.  You look a little threatening like that.  You put your game face on, man.  You're stuck grabbing yourself.  Hey, Patrice.  Monster house on the side of this bus.  I was just telling you about the movie during the break.  Let's see that shit.  The 3D one.  The 3D action.  It's not bad.  All right.  After this bus passes, we'll get back to the game. 
[01:19:00]  The bus driver is shaking her head at me.  How you doing?  Find out.  Find out.  Why is she shaking her head?  How you doing?  Excuse me, ma'am.  Is there a problem?  You don't appreciate it?  No.  She doesn't.  She's not happy.  Arriba Zane.  She's not happy what you just saw.  No.  All right.  Game on.  Here comes the cab.  Here it comes.  Put the mics down.  Go in.  Start hailing.  All right.  Cabby's coming up.  Cabby's coming up.  Another one that's kind of in the middle. 
[01:19:30]  Patrice, what do you think?  Patrice, what do you think?  He was going.  He got me.  He wanted me.  He was going.  Oh, he wanted me.  He was going.  And then he thought the...  He was going.  He was fucking taking a Nazi.  Totally taking the night.  He looked like a Nazi.  Do you see him?  Wait.  I'm going to the judges.  Nazi or shwoogie?  Nazi.  That was so Nazi.  That was so Nazi.  I'm going to pull this out.  I'm going to pull this out for niggas.  Wow.  You better pull this out. 
[01:20:00]  Nice.  You better pull this out, man.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, what a comeback.  Fuck.  Wow.  What a comeback the Rike is making.  Patrice just saw a girl with huge tits, and now he doesn't know where he is.  Patrice.  Niggas, stay in the game.  I'm pulling.  Stay in the game.  I'm pulling a Jesse Owens on you, motherfucker.  You better.  All right.  Hold on.  As soon as this bus passes, game back on.  It is three for the Nazi, two for the shwoogie.  What a comeback the Nazis are making.  Now, we can't.  Ant needs one more, and he takes out the shwoogie. 
[01:20:30]  I need one more, Kev.  And the Nazis will win.  All right.  Here comes the Kev.  Get in there, Ant.  My money's on Ant.  Kev is making the left onto 57th Street.  Here he goes.  He is.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Thanks, man.  We're on.  Damn.  We're going to game seven.  It's going right to game seven.  All right.  Hold on.  Don't yell yet.  I am in the street.  Hold on.  Let's set this up. 
[01:21:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get in the street.  All right.  Hold on.  Here we go.  Jesse Owens.  Wait.  Don't hail this one yet.  Hold on.  Let's set it up.  So, here we go.  The shwoogies got three.  The Nazis got three.  Wait.  Wait.  Ready?  Okay.  Ready?  Game on the line.  Okay.  You stand there.  Yeah.  I'm going to come out and wave it before you.  We're going to catch you.  You're going to already be waving, and I'm going to run up, and I'm going to wave to get  right ahead of you.  Okay.  Ready?  All right.  All right.  Hold on. 
[01:21:30]  Or maybe you guys should start from this doorway and go to your spot.  And then go run.  We run to the spot.  That's exactly it.  Run to the spot at the same time.  We come here, and then we...  Okay.  All right.  You go over there where you were.  Yes.  I go where I was.  Absolutely.  As we're both hailing.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Yeah.  You go straight this way.  Yeah.  Make sure it's...  Okay.  Plenty of cabs.  Plenty of cabs.  Okay.  See that one right here?  You say go, Obi.  You say go.  Right there.  See him?  All right.  Hold on.  See that cab?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  When that light turns green...  And he's right up front.  Wait, man.  So we get a green light like a drag race. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  It's like a drag race.  When that light turns green, game on.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on.  Shwuggie versus the Nazi.  Because that means three of them passed you by.  Mother...  For a knock.  A knock.  So you...  Who gets passed up?  The people that were enslaved for so many years or the people that killed six million  Jews?  You've already lost, man.  Fuck.  You've already lost.  All right.  What about this cab turning?  You may have a point.  As soon as that light turns green.  Light turns green. 
[01:22:30]  Game on.  Game on.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, you got to put the mics down.  Yeah.  Mic's down when the light turns green.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam, get this.  This is for the title right here.  Here it is.  Lights turning green.  Any second now.  And then we'll step out.  And...  And give our...  Go!  Game on!  Wait till he moves a little.  Wait till he moves.  Oh, shit.  He's turning.  Oh, he just...  No, he just grabbed somebody.  Oh, he did.  And a swogie at that, by the way.  All right.  Good.  I'm due. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  Right behind.  Right behind that cab.  As soon as he takes off.  Can't be two cabs in a row picking up black people.  Oh, yeah.  That would be...  It's got to be a Nazi sympathizer driving one of these.  That's like the deal of getting three tins.  Go!  Go!  Game on!  Go!  Nazi versus the swogie.  The cab!  Oh, damn!  The Nazi list!  Damn!  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for picking up a Nazi before an African American. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, Patron!  Did you realize that, sir?  I didn't know that.  You didn't know that?  You didn't see him with the gold chains and everything?  Oh, yeah.  Gold chain or silver chain.  Did you notice I'm wearing a German Nazi war helmet and I gave you the Nazi salute as  a hail?  Did you see me first?  Oh, and there he goes.  Did you see me first?  Ask him.  Ask him.  I need a motherfucking cab!  The Nazis win!  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  Oh, is that not right?  Patrice, that is not right. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  So, wait.  What happened?  What did the guy say?  This motherfucker.  He said he didn't see Patrice.  Patrice came bolting out.  He didn't see a 500-pound nigga with jewelry on and a mic.  And a mic.  He didn't see it.  These guys have been influenced, by the way, because what I noticed every time, they're  stopping sort of in the middle, like they're confused, and then they inch up toward Anthony.  And then they inch up toward the Nazi.  Just to get, like, just to get past you. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  Just in case.  Unbelievable.  There is a problem in this city.  You motherfucker.  I thought Danny Glover was full of shit.  The Third Reich gets a cab?  The Third Reich gets a cab before a black guy.  Are you fucking serious?  This city is fucked up.  Are you fucking serious?  Out of seven.  That was amazing.  Oh, Patrice.  I was sure I was going to win that.  I was sure you were going to win it.  That's ridiculous.  You pulled away. 
[01:25:00]  I had a comeback.  The fucking Third Reich pulled away.  And it's good, because with the seventh one, we did it completely even, where we both  came out at the same time, gave our little salutes and hails, and he came right to me.  Right to the Nazi.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  The injustice.  That's fucking despicable shit.  Did you see that?  Did you fucking see that?  Despicable.  Holy shit.  We'll be back upstairs in a few minutes.  It's the worst of the OPN3 show. 
[01:25:30]  Unbelievable.  Oh, that video's got to go up.  Yeah.  That video has to go up, because that was some of the most despicable injustice you will  see.  Oh, my God.  Was that funny?  The Nazi.  Every cabbie had a move.  He tried to stop right in between the two, but then he kept inching forward toward Anthony.  Yeah, even the ones that were stopping for Patrice were like, eh, do I stop? 
[01:26:00]  Do I roll forward to the Nazi?  I really thought he was stopping.  I thought you won.  Yeah, I thought you were just going to sweep it.  I thought the first one was a fluke, and then after you got two more in a row, I thought,  okay, now it's just going to be a sweep.  But no.  No.  Just horrid cab drivers.  And then we had a couple that didn't, that kind of stopped for me, and then he drove away,  and I looked in, and he looked like a U-boat commander.  That guy, that pulled right up to me, and then pulled away when I shoved the mic in  there, that guy was a U-boat commander. 
[01:26:30]  Das Boot.  Thought we had enough palaver earlier.  Yeah, more palaver for everyone.  More palaver.  Did I make it known that I hate that guy?  I think so.  Now there's going to be a problem, but fuck him.  Dude.  I think calling him a piece of shit might have done it.  I left some stuff up here.  You know, we went on break for, what, two weeks?  Turn off the goddamn music.  Thank you. 
[01:27:00]  Or fade it out slowly.  Oh, Jesus.  So, I'm running around like crazy, right, just before Christmas Eve, and I remembered I forgot  stuff up here that I needed for Christmas, right?  Gifts and such.  Very important.  So, I was shopping on 57th here, and I'm like, you know what, I'll go get the stuff  now.  Perfect.  I'm right here.  I'm here.  I walk in. 
[01:27:30]  It's me and that dude.  Like, I don't even know why he was working that day, because no one is coming in and  out of the building.  No.  And I walk up to him, and I go, hey, what's up?  I don't have my building ID card.  I don't acknowledge you.  But I have to go upstairs and get some stuff for Christmas.  And the guy goes, I can't let you up.  I'm like, you see me every day.  What do you mean you can't let me up?  And then he's like, well, I'll call up to see if anyone can come get you.  So, he calls up here. 
[01:28:00]  And of course, no one's here, because it's like, I think it was like the day before Christmas,  somewhere around there.  So, of course, no one's here.  And I got gifts and stuff up here, because no one's answering.  I'm like, all right, well, just let me up.  I'll be two minutes.  He goes, no, I can't let you up.  I'm like, you're kidding, right?  I get into an all-out freaking verbal battle with you guys.  Did you have the thing to get you in the door?  Yeah, how would you have gotten in here?  How would you have gotten into here, though?  Huh?  Did you have the thing you need, the electronic little meh, to get through the doors to up here?  That's the business.  If you had your ID, you would have had it. 
[01:28:30]  You might have been able to get through that, yeah.  You wouldn't have been able to get through that, yeah.  No, he wouldn't even let me upstairs.  No, no, I know, but I'm saying you wouldn't have gotten in anyway.  It doesn't matter.  He's a cut dude.  The fact is, he wouldn't let me upstairs.  I'm glad it happened to you, because that's why I don't talk to him.  Maybe there's someone that was here that wasn't answering the phone.  Who knows?  At least give me a chance, or I'm sure he could let me in.  All those wasted hellos.  He's a pile of shit with a fucking tie thrown on it, and that's why I don't...  He gave me a hassle one time it took. 
[01:29:00]  That fucking cunt one time.  And I'll never acknowledge his life again.  Ever.  I can't wait until I get screwed over and conjoined everybody and that's fun.  He's got a useless job.  He's a piece of shit.  And I told him all this.  Well, I just said piece of shit right to his face, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  That wasn't like hiding behind, you know...  That's not going to help.  That was right to his face.  And he is.  And I said, you have a useless job.  You're a fucking loser on a power trip.  You know I work here. 
[01:29:30]  You see me every fucking day.  You know you have a microphone, too.  It's not that that makes you a better citizen, but the odds are most people who are on-air personalities, most, don't go on shooting sprees.  He just sees you every day.  He knows who you are.  He's just a fucking worm.  I tell you, there's a black guy that works here who I actually like now.  But one time, I see him every morning.  I didn't have my ID.  He made me call up and get somebody.  I never acknowledged there was a human being there for six months that he worked on.  I would never acknowledge him. 
[01:30:00]  I'm like, if you want to look at me like I'm a robot, then I will treat you as a piece of machinery.  Oh, I like the way you think.  I don't say hi to machinery.  Why would I say hi to you?  If our interpersonal relationships are that fraudulent where you see me one day without my ID and don't remember me or don't acknowledge me,  then why would I ever speak to you as anything other than a desk again?  Like an ATM where you have to swipe your card.  You can't talk to an ATM and go, I was at this bank yesterday.  You know me. 
[01:30:30]  He needs to see your card.  And I don't talk to the other guy at the other building because one day I forgot my ID and I'm like, how could this possibly be a problem?  The guy sees me every day.  I'm walking in with Kenny who showed his ID.  What could be the problem?  And we get all the way to the elevator, inside the elevator.  It's five in the morning.  No one's around.  And also he's like, hey, hey, hey, you got to sign in.  Like losing his mind.  Sign in.  Which guy was it?  There's two guys that work at the Free FM place. 
[01:31:00]  The bigger one.  See, I like the fatter guy.  Nope.  It's the skinny one who looks like, who looks like Fillmore Slim, the fucking San Francisco pimp that I don't like.  Yeah.  That's who I don't like because he's a fucking, he stopped me one time.  All right, that's good, that's good.  Can I, can I ask a civilized, can I ask a civil question?  Sure.  Yeah.  Out of, out of the realm of friends and work associates and, and everything else.  What if you just had your ID with you all the time? 
[01:31:30]  Correct.  Correct.  So why talk to them?  But because we're on, we're on break for two weeks, I, I kind of emptied out the wallet.  Because I wanted to do that.  Hold on.  But I knew I'd forget.  No, because to get into these stupid buildings, you need, I mean, we need two cards for each place.  I know, it's ridiculous.  It's like having four extra credit cards or whatever in your wallet.  And they're thicker than credit cards.  So what, what I do on, every Friday, I empty out my wallet, but I put it right on the counter.  Oh, see.  So Monday morning comes, I, I, I, I grab them. 
[01:32:00]  I don't want that big fat fucking wallet.  It's ridiculous.  You're right.  I hate all the cards we need.  We should have one nice, one single card that works everywhere.  I, I, I want.  And that with a ton of PBA cards I have.  Like, it's quite a, so the other guy gave me a problem.  Like, you're kidding, man.  I won't talk to them.  And the guy's like, you don't sign in, you don't go upstairs.  I'm like, you know, and I know it sounds like a little thing, and it is.  It's not that much.  But, but these guys, the point I'm making is these guys, what is their purpose? 
[01:32:30]  What is their purpose?  Their security for the building, are you kidding me?  It's fake, yeah, it's fake security.  But they know.  Full sense of security.  Yeah.  They know you, they see you every day.  And that, the guys down here, I hate more, uh, because the, well, the Free FM guys see you  early in the morning, so they, they look at your face, they know you every day.  The guys here, the guys are kind, I think he was bringing a box out one time, he tried  to hassle me.  And the guy who, who, whatever, whatever, whatever it is.  That's the other thing.  It is. 
[01:33:00]  No, that's the other thing, just to explain, give it a little back history.  If you, if you try to leave this building with a box that's a little too big, that's  a problem, too, for some reason.  Might be leaving with some valuables.  That's a problem for some reason.  Yeah.  Even though it's your stuff, it has your name on it, because someone, you know, mailed it  to you or whatever.  That's a problem as well.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  You have to leave through a certain door, which, of course, I didn't.  I was like, it's not, you're going to have to physically stop me if you think I'm leaving  with, you're out of your fucking mind, you fucking chimp.  If you think I'm not leaving with my own stuff. 
[01:33:30]  It's my stuff.  Exactly.  Go fucking chimp.  I would love to see you on fucking alone.  I wouldn't acknowledge it.  Here's your options.  Tackle me and get your fucking face punched, or just keep talking in that fucking dirty tongue  that you're talking.  Shut your fucking mouth.  I'm with Jimmy, man.  I am completely right.  Don't acknowledge them.  Don't be rude, but don't acknowledge them.  Just so everyone can keep scoring at home, two buildings, a bunch of security guys, I 
[01:34:00]  was acknowledging everybody in the beginning.  I had no problem.  Right.  No problem.  So I haven't acknowledged the guy over there in six months, and now refuse to acknowledge  the guy over here ever again.  And the fuck, here's why.  Do you say hi to the urinal before you piss into it?  Never.  When you're about to shit, do you go, hello, toilet?  No.  No, you don't.  Same joke twice.  Yes, yes, I did.  Just two different bodily functions.  Dude, I look the guy in the eye.  I go, am I allowed up now? 
[01:34:30]  And he goes, yeah, yeah, all uncomfortable, because he saw the pack of wolves we travel  with.  He's just a...  And then I had called him a piece of shit right to his face.  Do you show your ID today?  No.  I don't either.  Exactly.  You never show it.  No, we don't have to show after a certain hour.  Like, you don't have to show it.  After hours, you've got to show again.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yes, you do.  That's why we had a show early, early.  No, no.  You do have to show it.  Absolutely.  You have to show it all day.  I have never shown my ID.  Because they like you.  See?  There's a personality thing.  And I was saying hi to people. 
[01:35:00]  And I tell you, I learned my lesson.  No more acknowledgement.  You want to treat me that way?  Well, I'm not human to you.  Like, oh, okay.  Then go, fuck your mother.  I'm not going to say hi to you.  I'm not going to be rude.  I'm not going to yell, fuck you.  I just walk by as if there's a fucking coat.  And there's a coat rack behind the counter.  That's what you are to me.  You're a coat rack who talks in a dirty tongue.  I don't know what shithole you were born in.  But you're not there now.  You're a dirty-tongued coat rack. 
[01:35:30]  Dude, can you go downstairs with a huge box?  Someone is suggesting this.  Jay Peterson from Wack Bag.  Thank you, Jay.  Jay's going, hey, I think it's time for a test.  Send Jimmy in and out of the building with large boxes and see how long it will take  before the lump of shit with a tie hassles in.  No, in the building.  Then Jimmy can explode.  Can you please leave with a fucking copy box?  A copier box?  In the building's different.  To me, then he has a right to stop you because you're bringing something.  It's almost like a shipment that you're not allowed to bring into a regular elevator. 
[01:36:00]  But as far as when I'm leaving, if it's something that's mine, I'm not stopping.  It's none of your goddamn business, sir.  Leave with a big box right now.  See what he says.  I'll, if it's a...  How big?  We got a big box?  Please do this, Jimmy.  All right.  Look at how big the box is.  Oh, wow.  That box is huge.  Please go try to leave with a big-ass box.  That is a big-ass box.  No, you see, that's almost a box.  That's some noxious.  No, but that's a box that doesn't make sense.  That's a box that's too big.  That doesn't make sense.  I'll tell you why.  Well, we want to try to keep it...  You know what?  That box is ridiculous outside of the deck. 
[01:36:30]  Hold on, but we want to keep it funny, though.  That's hilarious.  How big is that?  That is a huge box.  Now, well, the microphones...  Get someone down there with a microphone at first.  I'll just...  What am I going to do with it?  Just walk out with it and do what?  Just walk to the street.  See if you can get out of the building without him questioning the fact that...  I don't care if you're questioning me.  I'm going to keep walking.  I'm going to keep walking.  Fiddle with it, like, in front of him.  Like, you've got to kind of prop it up.  Like, be carrying it, and then stop kind of in front of him and hike it up a little higher. 
[01:37:00]  Make him take note.  You don't...  I will, but I don't want to engage him at all.  Like, I don't want to...  Yeah, you really don't even want to.  You want to keep him as a machine.  He's...  To me, he's a non-existent.  I mean what I say.  When I see a pile of shit, that's what I see when I look at that person.  I'll walk out with a box, make it totally empty.  I just...  I don't want to play with him.  I don't want to...  I just want to go, die, die.  That's all I want to say, die.  Oh, stop crying.  He was 93.  You really don't. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, I really have had enough of Ford, too.  Sorry.  He would have tripped and killed himself sooner or later.  Horse-bumbling ass.  Yes.  That's funny.  I just did a Gerald Ford clumsy joke in 2006.  Oh, my fucking Richard Lewis.  Get Sam and his camera.  I just want video.  Rich Little.  I meant Rich Little.  What'd you say?  I said Richard.  Richard Lewis.  Ooh.  God, I've got to listen better.  I just thought the old reference, though.  Kind of almost worked.  Note to self.  And 007, listen better. 
[01:38:00]  The 007.  The 007.  The 007.  The 007.  The 007.  007 is like what it is.  06.  07.  What's wrong with that?  Why do they got to...  Why does the hip-hop community have to call it the 007?  I don't know.  I kind of...  It's kind of the obvious one that they grabbed.  I like the 007.  Yeah.  I don't like it.  All right.  Jimmy, are you willing to just...  Of course I'm willing.  I'm going to walk out of the box.  All right.  Where am I going to put it?  Here's the thing.  She's got a Star Wars pocketbook, and she's dressed like a Jawa. 
[01:38:30]  She's got that hood.  She looks like the chick from Breakfast Club.  Now, what should I do with this?  Someone from our office can be outside and take it.  Dude, it's not your responsibility.  Just get the box out of the...  Just get it past them.  Okay.  Must get boxed past piece of shit.  Yeah.  That's your mission.  Yeah.  Once it's past them, fuck them.  Wait.  What's the bit called?  Must get boxed past piece of shit.  All right.  All right.  This is going to be as big as Son of Sam 3.  It's going to be a big one. 
[01:39:00]  Wait a minute.  How about this?  Yeah.  Do me a favor.  Get me a picture.  Here's what I want in that box.  Uh-huh.  I want photos of men's cocks taped to the bottom of the inside of the box.  I want...  Get me that honcho magazine.  So when he...  If he decides to open it up, go ahead, piece of shit.  Look in it.  It's just going to be cock.  Just lined with cock.  If he says what's in that box, I'm going to say photos of men's cocks. 
[01:39:30]  Get me photos of men's cocks and bring that box in here.  And then he would want to look, and you wouldn't be lying.  Nope.  That's what's in here.  Here's their options.  I'm carrying the box out, or I'll leave it here.  I don't want any trouble with that guy.  And that box can fit a lot of cock pictures.  As every good box can.  As every good box can.  Oh.  If I want to carry a photo of Laura... 
[01:40:00]  A box of cock photos...  Right.  ...taped inside, it's my business.  Fan, comment on the cock photos.  Uh, somehow our supplies are light, so we have to wait.  Well, of course they are.  Who the fuck is taking home the honcho?  What do you mean, who the fuck?  Travis, not only did you win $5,000, you had to steal all my best photos.  You can afford your own gay pornography now.  Well, how about this?  Someone's going out and buying a couple of quick fucking honchos.  That's right.  That guy's going to think we're fags for real, by the way.  I want to know... 
[01:40:30]  This is a sad day.  Who the fuck is...  We bought at least five copies of honcho since we've been doing that gag.  All right.  They all make it up here into the office.  What?  What happened?  Ah, okay.  Now my...  All right.  Now it's answered.  I'm doing a promo.  I don't even know what I...  I need an inspiration.  You just walked into...  You're backed into...  You're backed into...  Apparently...  One of the guys said that you were the one that took the pictures.  What? 
[01:41:00]  What are we talking about?  I have no idea what I just walked in.  The big cock pictures.  Big cock pictures.  According to two other sources...  Careful.  We're looking for...  We are looking to take that box and have Jimmy play, get the big box past the piece of shit.  Okay.  Something like that.  Downstairs.  I forget the name.  Who cares?  It's a good one.  And as...  Yeah, but the name was so nice.  As a little comic twist, we want to tape pictures of men's cocks on the bottom of the box.  Inside the box.  So if he asks what's in the box, Jim's going to go... 
[01:41:30]  Photos of men's cocks.  Photos of men's cocks.  And if he wants to see, it's not that he's joking.  He'll open it up and there'll be just photos of men's cocks.  Of men's cocks.  If he mines his beeswax...  Right.  He will let you just walk out.  He'll get off on the big box.  That's all he should do.  Now, we were wondering...  Someone's suggesting that we should fill the box with dildos.  Well...  No, it's too heavy.  Yeah, too heavy and not funny.  How about we fill it with fucking molten lava and so he looks at it and he'd spill it onto  his feet.  It's a simple bit, folks.  Fill it with dead babies and then throw them at him. 
[01:42:00]  So, Steve, I had commented that perhaps on six occasions...  Sure.  ...five or six occasions we had bought the copies of Honcho Magazine...  Right.  ...for our walk bit over here, which make their way up into the office.  Sure.  Where are the honchos?  Somebody, obviously, has taken a honcho, which is nothing but men with washboard abs and  giant hard-ons fucking each other.  Somebody was stealing them rolled up one at a time. 
[01:42:30]  I don't like what you're implying.  Here's the problem I have with this big box.  Uh-huh.  This is the problem I have with it.  I want a box that...  That's almost one that justifies him stopping.  I want one that does not justify it.  A little smaller.  Only because I can't begrudge a guy for doing his job.  Not a ring box holding it out in front of you.  No.  And walking going, lead, lead, lead.  No, no, no.  A box... 
[01:43:00]  You shouldn't be stopping you for any box.  That's the part of the...  More of this one.  That's almost too small.  That's too small.  Here's why.  Because there's a freight...  In my building where I live, there's a freight elevator rule.  And even as a resident, I mean, maybe they would let me get away with it.  But technically, if you bring a huge box in, it's got to go through the freight elevator.  And it's got to go through the freight elevator.  And it can't go out where people are coming in.  Because that will hinder foot traffic.  That's my thought.  What about that box?  Will he stop me for that?  I don't know.  See, now that's looking better.  I say you have to go with the oversized box.  I think you need the giant box. 
[01:43:30]  If that's the best one, I'll do it.  The giant box of cocks.  Giant box, pictures of cocks.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.  I want something a little smaller than that.  That just, to me, would enrage me.  That wouldn't enrage me if he stopped me with that.  Just say I got fired and it's all my stuff.  It should enrage you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they have a certain, again, there's a certain job they have to do.  I don't want to be unreasonable.  I'm not doing a bit.  I hate the guy's guts for real.  We're going to take a chance with the box Than just showed you.  But we could go with that if it's more reasonable.  I don't know. 
[01:44:00]  That might be too small.  I don't want to be too small either.  So he doesn't stop me.  No.  It's either the one Than showed you or the giant box.  It's got to be bigger than.  A grape or a watermelon?  Do we have a fucking orange or a grapefruit?  Exactly.  We need a bit of a bigger box.  We're not in the business of making boxes around here.  What's in that box up next to the thing up there on the shelf?  No.  Keep going.  Yeah.  That box.  What's in there?  That's a good size box.  And that's one he shouldn't stop.  See?  Look at that.  Let me see. 
[01:44:30]  Perfect.  Why don't you just.  That's.  That's.  That's good.  Okay.  That's a good box.  That's good.  What.  Yeah.  Did you think it was too big or.  That's fine.  Okay.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's something that I.  I'm wondering.  That's about the size.  Me and Danny were taken out.  What are me and Danny doing?  Danny knows what we're talking about.  Now get us some men's dicks.  That's right.  Danny was with me.  I was trying to bring a box out.  The guy gave us a fucking hard time.  That's why.  Ah.  Oh.  Thank you.  From your private collection.  Yes.  Craig.  Jesus.  Thank you.  Danny came up with that.  Danny came running in here all angry. 
[01:45:00]  You came up with that magazine a little too quick.  Oh.  Look at.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Look at this fucking.  Look at this.  There's a guy out there holding his cock bulge in his underpants.  But what a handsome fella he is.  Holy shit.  Jesus.  That looks like one of the Google dolls.  What a.  I don't even know what they look like.  It just sounded funny.  You're thumbing.  You're thumbing through.  What is that one called?  In inches.  Hold on.  This is the old make my cock look bigger by grabbing at the bottom of my ball bag.  And squeezing trick.  Which one of us hasn't done that on Pal Talk?  All right. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  How about some scissors?  Ooh.  Strawberry.  And some tape in a box.  That's a good picture right there to tape on the bottom.  That one.  It's a box of cocks.  That's a good.  And I'm not.  And just the giant cock one.  It's kind of a montage of cocks.  It's going to be hard to figure out which ones to use because the front and back of the  page are both so good.  I think the dilemma we're having is which one do you really want to look at?  Those are the ones that will face up.  Look at these fucking dough faces.  What about that picture of him pulling his ass cheeks up? 
[01:46:00]  Well, you're preaching to the choir.  Do I not know?  Of course that.  Why not?  Why not, Jim?  Why not enjoy the sunshine?  Of course.  All right.  He's got his scissors.  It's an art project.  Here's what I'm doing.  So I don't ruin any cock pics.  I'm actually fucking opening the staples in the middle.  Oh.  Very good.  It looks like you've done this before.  So there's going to.  Well, that's how you hang them up on your wall.  Well, I've done with kiss pictures for my whole life.  Not cock photos. 
[01:46:30]  No, no.  Now, now.  Hey, hey.  Guys, hey.  Now, let's play, but not that rough.  Hey, whoa, hey.  Wowee.  If I don't be careful with the scissors, he won't be uncircumcised for long.  How about a knife so I can open this?  I don't fucking, you know.  All right.  What's the bit called again?  Just take the nut.  Thanks.  I think simply it should just be box of cocks.  But it's get the box.  Must get the box past the piece of shit.  No, but cocks has to be in there, too. 
[01:47:00]  Must get the box of cocks by the piece of shit.  Piece of shit.  It will spell by B-I.  The piece of shit.  Must get box of cocks by the piece of shit.  By the piece of shit.  Jay Peterson's back.  He's suggesting that you put your own cock in the box.  Is that it?  Oh.  Cut a hole.  What's in there?  My cock.  My cock.  And then you open it up, and your cock and balls are shoved through.  Wow.  Do I wish I had the fucking moral courage to do that.  That is a good one.  It would be the funniest fucking thing ever. 
[01:47:30]  My cock.  And he'd get a good laugh like, ha-ha, very funny, let me see.  You wouldn't laugh.  People are reminding you to make sure you carry the box like it's really heavy.  They're just giving you suggestions for the bit.  What's the bit called again?  Get the box.  Must get the box of cocks by the piece of shit.  Bit.  Now we have to, look at the way you got the centerfold out.  How good you are at this.  Now what we have to do is, here's what we have to do. 
[01:48:00]  We have to get a cover for that too.  Again, you can't give people a fucking reason to have a problem just to make the bit work.  It's got to be fucking organic.  Can I have the scissors?  Please stand.  Jesus Christ.  What do you think about having a picture of a cock on the outside of the box?  Nah.  That's too much.  Exactly.  That's advertising.  And Steve would stop me from leaving.  I don't know.  I just want to look at the box for a little longer.  Yes.  That looks like furniture that's being moved into my house.  Wonderful.  Fantastic.  Yes, move the box over here, please. 
[01:48:30]  Yes, just place it next to the sofa.  I like this one too.  This is a good one.  There's just two men standing there.  Oh no.  Fucking, there's one kneeling.  They both have rods.  One is kneeling and one is looking up.  And they're both just looking at each other's eyes.  Two hard cocks that are keeping eye contact.  These are guys who like intimacy.  Alright, can somebody else fucking cut these, please?  It looks like you're enjoying that part of it.  I'd really rather have somebody else cut them.  Have you seen the ads for the Guys Gone Wild video? 
[01:49:00]  There's the Girls Gone Wild video.  Everyone knows what the fuck that's about.  There's the ad for Guys Gone Wild.  And it's the same exact commercial, but only with guys.  So it's not even like...  I think they're only marketing it to gay gentlemen.  Because it's not like girls would watch this and go,  Alright, it's guys doing what they do.  Working out.  Or surfing.  Or something girls might want to see guys do. 
[01:49:30]  It's guys...  Got some more examples there, buddy.  I was trying to come up with some more.  It's guys doing like...  Surfing.  Making the...  Let me think.  Riding bikes.  Like motorcycles.  What else is hot to watch guys do?  Number one answer on the board!  On the board, number one.  Get hit by a whiskey bottle by your father.  Guys on the elliptical machine.  Oh, there you go. 
[01:50:00]  They do the same thing.  By the way, Bill from Waterford...  They're shutting their eyes and...  No, no, no.  It's horrid.  Slow down a little bit.  Yes?  There's a yield sign right here.  Bill and Waterford...  I don't slow down for those.  No, Ed, I have not seen Guys Gone Wild videos.  How are you seeing these?  I didn't see the video.  I saw the commercial for it, you fucking faggot.  As I'm trying to explain this.  It's a commercial.  It comes on like Comedy Central and Spike.  I don't know why.  Like a guy's...  It should be on Lifetime, perhaps.  I don't know. 
[01:50:30]  But I've seen the commercials for it.  And the commercials are exactly like the Girls Gone Wild commercials.  So they show two guys like in a hotel room where, you know, it's chicks and they're kind of touching each other.  But they're wrestling around and they're guys.  Was that on Logo?  I think it's on Logo.  I'm a subscriber to Logo.  Logo.  I saw Fatty's Gone Wild.  No.  That's on, I think, Break.com.  Who hosted that one?  Marlon Perkins? 
[01:51:00]  Wow.  Fatty's Gone Wild was a great spoof.  Going back.  Great spoof on the Girls Gone Wild.  On Girls Gone Wild?  It's really funny.  It's on Break.com if you haven't checked it out yet.  The Girls Gone Wild...  Now they got them on these anti-gravity planes.  Yeah, I saw that.  I saw that commercial.  It's like it's the most unsexy fucking thing.  Here comes this floating naked whore past the camera.  But they've run out of things to do with the hot chicks.  They've completely run out of things to do.  It used to be where it was supposed to be.  Spring Break.  They taped girls, just college girls, showing their tits. 
[01:51:30]  And it's mutated into this staged, like, fucking strippers licking each other.  Just get fucking porno.  Do they show any pussy eating?  I don't know, because I've only seen the commercials.  I've never actually seen one of these.  I hear they keep it pretty R-rated, really.  I bet you they can't, because it's sold on television.  Yeah.  No, it's all about the boobies.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  The commercials for Girls Gone Wild would absolutely have been jacket material growing up. 
[01:52:00]  They show enough where, you know, they're just kind of blurring out the titties.  They put the little Girls Gone Wild logo over it and stuff.  And they have them in their panties.  They're showing pretty much ass, bare ass.  Absolutely.  Could have been jacket material.  Are we ready for the bit?  What's the bit called?  The bit?  It's called Musket.  It's called Musket.  The box of cocks past the piece of shit bit.  Nice.  Yeah.  We have to actually make a lid.  Yes.  So.  Why?  That box of cocks past the piece.  You should have a lid on there.  Can you just tape up the... 
[01:52:30]  Oh, look.  They made a lid.  We're making a homemade lid, so it's taking a little bit longer.  Jesus Christ.  Just put a lid on it.  This fucking Alan Funt candid camera.  Put a lid on there with cockpicks under it.  Cockpicks on the bottom of the lid.  So when you flip the lid, open that.  Right.  I thought we...  Every inch of the inside should be cockpicks.  Okay.  Wall-to-wall cockpicks.  Not an inch uncovered by cockpicks.  Jesus Christ.  Picture Travis telling what a decorator...  What a decorator would say to a decorator if he was buying a home.  Okay.  Wow.  Hold on.  Excuse me.  Wow.  Could you car crash that fucking... 
[01:53:00]  My apologies, Travis.  Does anybody remember last night?  Jesus Christ.  I should fall face first into that box after that joke.  Let's say hi to Jason, New Hampshire.  Jason.  What's going on?  What's up, Jason?  Hey.  You guys show rocks, man.  I just got to ask them.  And anyone who hasn't gotten it needs to get it, you guys are friggin' hilarious.  Thanks, man.  Give some shit.  I enjoyed his call. 
[01:53:30]  A brand new listener.  Welcome to the XM family.  Thank you.  I like it when people, you know, get the new XM for the holidays.  Of course.  And what is the live studio audience going to do today?  I don't know.  Sit there like lumps of shit and look in on us.  That's right.  I did the sex question last time.  How about they confess something they've never confessed before?  Ooh.  Well, I think three of them would be murder.  That's right.  Or how about that guy that looks towards the studio instead of just fucking staring vacantly 
[01:54:00]  off into the distance?  What, are you looking for an escape route at the open fire?  He's fucking just gazing towards the door.  There's a fucking bald guy with a beard not looking at the studio.  He's looking like everyone else is looking at the studio.  Oh, we're over here.  Yeah.  He's looking over everybody's heads toward the door.  It's like trying to figure out how he's going to get past Master Poe.  The person in the studio audience that's looking up at the monitor when the camera's on him.  That asshole.  We could have him confess stuff.  I like that.  Anything worthy?  Well, here's the deal. 
[01:54:30]  Well, they write it down on a piece of paper and we never know who confessed it.  That's true.  It makes it such a wonderful game.  We'll do that after the break.  Last time we played the sex thing, the strangest sex act they ever had.  Now a little confession.  I know.  I can't wait to read the one.  I got my ass fucked on Chewbacca sheets.  I have no idea who that will be.  Are we ready for the bit, which is called Must Get.  Must.  I almost got it now.  Must get box of cocks past piece of shit bit. 
[01:55:00]  Right.  Nice.  How's the box of cocks coming, Tham?  It's coming along nicely.  Ah, good.  I want to see the box of cocks.  Yes.  We must have a presentation.  Do we have tape?  Must meet our approval.  Are we almost done?  Do we have a fucking fake cock I can put in there?  Like one fake cock to roll around I can carry?  Just like a dildo kind of thing?  Yeah, of course we have.  We have a dildo.  Look at the quality of this Gerald Ford fucking video.  It's like this Bruder film. 
[01:55:30]  It's so far away.  What, no cameras were allowed close enough?  No, he wasn't a real president.  I don't think they're going to shoot him.  He wasn't a real president, so he gets like video phone coverage.  We didn't.  We didn't.  Ah, just so Giuliani is there.  All the bigwigs.  They're there showing off.  Wow, yeah.  Who's the first president you remember being dead?  Taft.  Taft.  Taft.  Jesus, it's not like we had a lot of choices, Anthony. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, God, how are you?  I just remember, because when I was a little tater tot, LBJ died.  Lyndon Baines Johnson.  Didn't he die with like a long beard and stuff like he was totally nuts?  I have no idea.  I was a little kid, and I was horrified because I was watching the news coverage.  My parents were watching it, so I was like in the room, and I heard him say,  as the body makes its way down the street, and as a kid, I thought the body, a body was  only your torso.  Your arms are your arms, your legs are your legs, your head is your head, and your body 
[01:56:30]  was this part.  So I thought they had chopped his arms, legs, and head off, and just put his body in there,  and it gave me nightmares of LBJ's limbless, headless body being driven down the street.  So where do you think the rest of his body went?  I didn't know I was a stupid little kid.  I'm only a one.  I wasn't one.  He was 21.  I don't know when he died.  When did LBJ die?  I don't know.  79?  Fuck you. 
[01:57:00]  I didn't know I was just a frightened little child.  For me, it was Nixon.  Nixon?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Nixon didn't die that long ago, though.  No.  That was it?  It went LBJ-Nixon?  It was it.  Death-wise.  Was that it, death-wise?  Yes.  Wow, what a streak.  Because Nixon, there was a photo.  Carter's still alive.  Ford was still alive.  Reagan just died.  Yes.  Yeah.  Nixon, Reagan, not Ford.  They're all fucking dropping dead 10 minutes apart.  Jesus.  Give us a fucking breather. 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  I didn't know it went LBJ-Nixon.  Yep.  It's quite the living president streak.  Should we take a break before we do our...  While they tape up, I see them taping.  Look out.  Now, make sure you're doing the right side.  Don't put ugly cocks.  Get the good ones.  73?  LBJ talking 73?  Yeah.  I mean, I was a little too old to be...  What a fucking body.  Sissy, you were...  That's impossible.  You were in high school.  No, I wasn't. 
[01:58:00]  That's right.  You should have been in college, but decided against college.  What do you think?  Was I 12 or 11 or something?  Wow, man.  How about this?  What a dopey little kid.  How about this?  A little too old for your stupid theory.  A little too old?  He was almost fucking voting.  I thought it was just the man's body.  How fucking old were you?  I could swear I was seven.  Or something. 
[01:58:30]  You weren't.  How did that...  It couldn't have been Eisenhower.  How literal were you?  How literal were you?  I guess I was.  Really stupid.  And he's ahead of the procession.  Ahead!  There's a head!  God Almighty, don't I could talk around you.  I was very sensitive.  I'm tired.  There's four of them on a car!  It was very scary growing up.  Oh my God, did you not handle things?  I was just scared.  It was a body. 
[01:59:00]  Why did you have nightmares?  Did you dream there were Jews living next to you?  Well...  Truman died in 72.  Johnson in 73.  All right.  Truman died in 72?  Yeah.  That's not even a good issue.  How come I don't remember that?  Someone had to die in 1966.  Eisenhower was 63.  Eisenhower was 63?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I was two.  No.  No.  It could have been.  No.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What month in 63? 
[01:59:30]  December, right?  Make it late.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It was 61.  Son of a bitch!  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  I'm sunk here.  When did Kennedy get shot?  63.  63.  Yeah.  Maybe it was Kennedy.  Hey, it might have been Kennedy.  Yeah, the body is being...  Oh, it was Kennedy!  I was too.  Oh, weren't you sweet?  I was scared.  It wasn't Kennedy.  It was Reagan.  It was Reagan.  It couldn't have been Johnson.  All these years, I thought it was LBJ, and it was Kennedy. 
[02:00:00]  All right, we're going to take...  Aw.  When we get back, we're doing the...  Must.  Must.  Get.  Box.  Of.  Cox.  Pass.  Piece of shit, bitch.  The all-request Worst of Show.  Subject the rest of the world to your favorite O&A moments.  Call 877-4-Worst-of.  Sub.  877-496-7786.  In the last segment, a caller actually requested this.  Yes, my name is Larry, and one of my favorite bits from the old XM Glory days is the old 
[02:00:30]  Box of Cox bit, where the boys took all the pictures of cocks, put them in a box, out  on the street corner, to see the reaction of people when they walked by.  Classic bit.  Loved it.  I think you'll enjoy it, too.  Continuing on with that bit, here's part two.  The all-request Worst of Show.  All right.  Anyway.  Oh, wait, wait.  Here's the box.  By the way, I wish I was right there.  Hold on.  Hi, you just farted in the box of cocks. 
[02:01:00]  Yes, right.  You were doing your impression of James Polk.  Wait.  Where did old swimming pool legs go?  We just hung up.  I got to go.  I guess Will thought we were having too much fun today.  Had to bring down the excitement and the happiness.  All right.  I'm going to go downstairs with this stupid box.  Oh, oh.  It's time to play.  Ant.  The name.  Oh, yes.  It is.  Must.  Must.  I know that. 
[02:01:30]  Must.  Get box of cocks.  Must get box of cocks past piece of shit bit.  Did Steve work up like a sweeper for this?  Where's the...  I just can't get box of cocks out of my mouth.  I need a microphone and headset, and Sam needs a microphone, too.  You got it.  Okay.  All right.  Now, let me just say what the box is.  I don't know if Sam filmed it, but it's an open box. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, Lord.  And it's filled with cock photos.  Jeez, that's a lot of cocks.  Oh, my God.  The biggest one being right on the lid.  No, but look.  Look what's inside of it.  There's a dildo, a pink fake cock that has been steadfastly taped to the bottom, and  it's standing straight up.  Dude.  All right.  Listen.  I got an idea.  Because this bit, after all the planning, might fail miserably.  Can we...  I say after the bit fails miserably, we leave that box on the sidewalk. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, good idea.  For all the nosy neds out there.  Put free on the lid.  Like, just write free.  Not what it is or anything.  Just free.  Just leave the box right next...  Right in the middle of the sidewalk.  Oh, and then we'll watch what people do.  Yeah, because this bit could be Jimmy walking with a box past somebody that says nothing.  Right.  Huh?  That'll be good.  And Danny, you're on the street, you know, nowhere near the box just so we can get the, 
[02:03:00]  you know...  Oh, can we watch out of the window?  Yeah.  Please get the mics ready.  I want to see this so fast.  Miss, would you like to open this box for $5?  $5.  $5.  No, just leave it there.  Wait for the...  I agree.  ...then, you know, the nosy neds.  Oh, yeah, right in the middle of the sidewalk.  You've got to write something.  Do you want to do it now or...  Free...  Why is it free now?  Free...  What should it be?  Free...  Wait, how about...  No, just don't write free.  Just write... 
[02:03:30]  Something that would make you...  What would make you want to...  Oh, well, you.  Box of coffee.  Wait, why don't we ask the peanut gallery?  Yeah, what should be written on there that would...  If you're walking down the sidewalk and you see a box, what would make you open it?  Huh?  What?  Liquor.  Liquor.  Booze.  Write DVDs.  DVDs, yeah, just DVDs.  Just write DVDs.  DVDs.  No one's going to open this.  No one will open it.  It's really got to entice you. 
[02:04:00]  Well, this does set up a good bit.  We will plan this one better for next time.  Yeah.  And we should get an empty TV box or plasma screen box and just put a giant fucking black dildo  in there and a blow-up mouth.  He goes, suck this, plasma whore.  Why?  I'd have to ruin it.  I guess we'll just throw it in the middle of the sidewalk, see if anyone is...  We'll open it up. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  Okay.  Lee, hold on.  All right.  It's time.  I can't hear you open.  I'm transferring headsets.  I have no ability to hear nothing.  I can't hear it.  There we are.  All right.  Good.  No one's talking.  Right on the back.  People saying, do not open.  Please take one.  Gerald Ford memorabilia.  Human head inside.  Free kittens.  Please take one.  It's good.  Free money.  Free puppies. 
[02:05:00]  That might be good because people might actually think there's puppies in there.  Free puppies.  Just write free puppy.  Yeah.  Free puppies.  Free puppy.  Please give good home.  How long are we going to say that?  Or just something like that year.  How about your mother was hit by a Bueller on Christmas Eve, the poor lass?  Free puppy.  Please bury your head.  But free puppy might be...  Someone might think there was a free puppy in there and not even go to look. 
[02:05:30]  But if you put please give home.  Free puppy.  I don't know what the wording is.  Just write free puppy.  Free puppy.  Yeah, somebody will open it.  Yeah.  Free puppy.  On white paper.  Free puppy needs home.  Yeah, put it on the top.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, someone write that sign and we'll add it to the box after the bit fails.  Okay, I agree.  All right, let's go.  Let's do the bit.  No, why not put it on the top of the fucking thing now?  Let him look.  He can ask what it is. 
[02:06:00]  What do you got?  I'll just say it's a box of photos of men's genitals.  Oh, I forgot.  I hope he's bank book.  Anthony's home address.  Free mumia.  Free mumia.  I'm going to suggest we write James Brown's head.  All right, free puppy.  There you go.  Put that on there.  Max Legg shitbag. 
[02:06:30]  Could you tear a bigger piece of tape off there?  What are you, just fucking arts and crafts?  He tore off a smidge of tape for the corner.  Company man.  You didn't want to waste it.  You know what it costs.  Here's the fucking tape.  Here we go.  Tape.  Here you go, you fucking dainty motherfucker.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  How hard is this?  Jimmy put a two foot long piece on, though.  Fucking tape.  Somewhere in between the two.  No, two pieces.  Done.  He's fucking smidging it off like it's an art project. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, with the cover these guys made, this could work.  It looks like a, yes.  All right, let's go.  If only we had a puppy.  Yes.  And then you fucking, you put milk on that cock and then the puppy is licking the milk  off the cock.  Open it up.  That's what we should do.  All right, here's another puppy.  I'm licking.  Here's a couple of fucking ideas.  One is we got to get an empty box that will entice people to open it.  And two, we have to get a dildo and put some kind of food on it that a kitten or puppy 
[02:07:30]  would love and just make them lick it off.  Like a fucking, a cock with like a hole in it, a little milk coming out of the tip.  That's my impression of an animal licking.  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I'm ready to go, boys.  All right.  I can't.  Oh, there we are.  My phone's off.  Okay.  All right, let's go, Jimmy.  Okay.  Jimmy is carrying the huge box of cocks out of the studio.  I don't think Jimmy should have his headphones on when he's doing this.  I mean, it might be.  I know you're not going to be able to hear us, but right when you open the elevator. 
[02:08:00]  Hey, don't they have the little ones?  I know you like the big ones.  They don't fit in his ears.  But how about a little one?  Just so you know.  Not the one that's been fucking in Danny's awful tomato ears.  Because it shouldn't look like you're working.  Yeah.  Like right now, it looks like you're on a radio show.  Yeah.  It should look like you're leaving the building.  Yeah.  Would he notice, though?  I mean, he's such a dumb piece of shit.  Would he even read it?  The headphones.  How do you think?  Would it mean anything to him?  Put your hood up.  I know you think of him as a fucking lump of diarrhea.  He is.  From James Polk's ass.  I'm just kidding.  God damn it. 
[02:08:30]  All right, put your hood up.  Let's see how that looks.  James Polk's toilet with a tie.  Now he's covering it with his hood.  That's nice.  Yeah, that'll work.  That's good.  That works.  Jimmy pulled his hoodie up.  Jimmy, keep the microphone hidden behind the box or something.  If you're holding it with the box, he won't figure that out.  Big box of cocks.  If I wrote, this is a radio bit on the side, he wouldn't figure it out.  He's a cunt with a hat. 
[02:09:00]  All right, let's go.  We've got two bits to do now.  We've got the free puppy on the top of the box of cocks.  Yeah.  So basically, after he gets it past the security guy, we're going to put the box out of the sidewalk.  And then we're going to watch to see how many people open up the lid to see the many, many pictures of huge cocks.  I cannot explain to people how horrific these pictures are.  They're not, like, cutesy little, like, soccer mom chuckles at a playgirl cover shot. 
[02:09:30]  This is hardcore, gay, hard-on, pornography, cock-up-ass pictures.  I went to college for this.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Box of cocks.  Oh, Jimmy's acting, too.  And he knows what to do with his hands.  That's right.  Hold the box.  That's right.  You idiot.  If I could hold a box in every scene, I'd be a star.  Fucking De Niro.  All right.  Oh, this box is heavy.  How's that for real?  Danny, you should get ahead of him.  Because we're going to lose the signal. 
[02:10:00]  So get near the door.  We're staying with the camera.  Oh, there he is.  I'm right here.  I got it.  All right.  Camera.  Camera.  The camera.  I just taped the damn hanging.  We're going to need microphones because we're going to go right to bits.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Is there anybody down there?  I don't know.  All right.  He better be.  I'll probably lose you on the elevator.  Useless piece of shit better be down there.  He won't stop me.  All right.  Where are you?  On the elevator yet?  No, not Jesus.  How fast do you think these elevators are?  This building's 200 years old. 
[02:10:30]  Really?  No, I'm still looking.  Danny is just pressing the fucking button incessantly.  Come on, Dan.  Make it faster.  That's what everyone knows.  That's where Polk died.  Right in front of those elevators trying to make it to a toilet.  For shitting ass.  Both of his boots were filled with liquidy shit.  He had to tuck his pants in like a horse rider so it wouldn't leak onto his presidential shoes.  Someone's suggesting if a kid tries to look in the box, we might want to try to save our jobs. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  Danny will go.  If he looks at his mother's closet, he'll find the same thing.  Don't worry.  Oh, I heard the camera roll.  Is that what that was?  That was the elevator.  Are you in the elevator?  Yeah.  I think he's going down.  They could lose us in the elevator.  That'll happen.  Can you guys hear?  Yeah, I can.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh.  I got...  Oh, no.  Hi, sir. 
[02:11:30]  He didn't even look.  Different guy.  Different guy.  We have to go to bit two.  I know.  I'm bringing it outside.  Why am I still...  Different guy.  Different guy after all that?  All that and the piece of shit ain't there.  That guy stinks.  Yeah.  All right.  Then again, maybe he died.  Okay.  So there could be a bright spot.  Let's take lemons.  Maybe he's got what Polk had.  I can only hope he's on his home shitter.  With him, he's throwing up.  All right.  Where do I put this?  Where can I put it where you guys can see it? 
[02:12:00]  All right, guys.  I'm right in front of the side.  Get off the street.  I don't want to walk across the street.  Well, have Danny get it across the street.  We'll be able to see it a lot better.  Yeah, walk across the street.  But then again, if a truck blocks you...  Oh, wait.  Jimmy, right there is good.  I see you now.  Okay.  But it should be in the middle of the sidewalk, because right there, it looks like the garbage  man's going to pick that up.  All right.  Here.  We'll move it in.  Danny, move it in.  All right.  All right.  The box is in place.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  It's the shift must have changed. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  A guy is looking.  He looked down at the note.  Oh, hold on.  I don't want anyone to do it while I'm coming up.  All right.  Where's Danny?  I'm here.  I'm in the doorway.  All right.  Whoa.  Oh, you just scared the shit out of me.  Sorry.  I opened the window.  You almost took my eye out.  I almost nailed you.  All right.  The box is in a perfect location.  Whoops.  I just dropped the knife.  I swear to God, what did you drop on someone's head?  I had a...  I mean, it sounded worse on the radio.  It was a plastic knife. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  That's it.  All right.  Now I'm all fucked up.  So far, no one's really looking at the box.  I'm coming up right now.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  All right.  And it says free puppies on it.  Yes.  I see a couple of, oh, three, two young ladies and a gentleman.  All right.  God, no one looks.  Oh, that girl looked.  Sort of.  It says free puppy.  It looks so lonely.  It's like, I...  Is it in the exact middle of the sidewalk?  Danny, could it...  It can't look like it's garbage.  You might have to turn it so they can read free puppy without turning their head. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, how about fucking turning it one way?  Wait.  Like where everyone's coming from.  But wait.  Yeah, wait.  Wait, let all these people pass just in case.  Oh, oh.  Oh, that guy looked.  He looked.  Did you see him?  Yeah.  Now here comes an old, older gray-haired gentleman.  He sees Bob.  They're looking at it.  Oh, he would have loved to have seen what was in that box.  I'm going to try and move it.  Move it kind of?  Yes.  No, no.  But move it in the middle of the sidewalk.  Move it away from the sidewalk. 
[02:14:00]  Away from the curb more.  All right.  Okay.  And straighten it out a little bit.  Make it look organized.  A box of genitals.  It's a box of cocks you're working with there, you douchebag.  This is much better.  All right.  Let's see.  Here comes a woman of color.  Your son.  Here comes another woman.  Older lady.  Taking a look.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's going to take one of these real tree-hugging animal lovers to walk by and take the chance.  Maybe should we have free puppy on the side, too? 
[02:14:30]  Or is that?  Well, this one's in.  Where's Jimmy?  Up here?  I'm right here, sweetie.  Oh.  Hi.  Imagine if we just looked out the window and saw each other.  Look at three homeboys walking by.  Oh, great.  Okay.  Hopefully they're not robbing somebody.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Guy looking.  Guy looking.  That's a piece of shit.  Hey, that's a piece of shit.  He wasn't behind the counter.  He must have been in the fucking can.  Oh, some guys.  Wait.  Oh, he's a...  Okay. 
[02:15:00]  Here comes the three homies.  God damn it.  The homies will look.  Danny, make sure he doesn't take our box.  It says free on it.  Make sure at least he looks at it.  Homies looking.  Looking.  Free puppy.  No?  It might be a pit bull motherfucker.  We might have to change the sign on the top.  What do you think it should say?  Free puppy's getting people to look.  Free puppy's getting people to look, but...  They might think it's a prank.  It is New York.  That guy's still looking.  See, the homies are still looking.  Of course they are.  All right.  We need one guy.  We should take bets on who it's going to take.  Please be the piece of shit.  Okay, here comes some fat person.  Oh, yeah.  Piece of shit could open up the box. 
[02:15:30]  Wait a minute.  Here comes a fat person.  Who's the biohazard suit person under us?  It might be food.  It might be food.  Free puppy.  Puppies good eating.  Puppies good eating.  Asian shall open it.  Puppies good eating.  All right.  What about this fat guy?  Old guy?  Old ball guy?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Wait into his hands.  God, people are taking a glance.  Look.  We might have to, like, fix up the box a little bit.  Here comes some.  Oh, please look.  It's going to take...  A lot of people coming now.  I think a girl will do it, but...  All right.  Look at...  Come on.  A lot of people. 
[02:16:00]  A lot of foot traffic.  Come on, woman.  They're all looking at the box.  It's right in the middle of the fucking...  Uh-oh.  Kids.  Look at the box.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wait, wait.  Here's somebody.  Oh, oh.  Here's a girl.  Here's a girl.  All right.  Look at...  A lady looking at him and shut the lid quickly.  A lady with a cane.  No, what was great was...  She's hobbling down the sidewalk, and she slowly opens it up. 
[02:16:30]  What was great was when she started opening up, more people gathered.  As soon as they all saw what it was, they all scattered and made believe they didn't know each other.  Danny is down there fucking laughing his ass off.  Oh, God damn.  Was that funny?  Oh, that was good.  That was a good one.  I had to run over there just to make sure those little kids weren't going to open up.  Oh, that's why you did that.  All right.  Very good.  You saved their jobs.  Kids can't see some cock.  Come on.  Not unless it's real.  Why waste their first time on a fake one?  Here comes a couple of...  Are these two ladies, or is that just a gay guy, and they're two gay gentlemen? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  If someone sits in the box, you'll know what you...  All right.  They're going to...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  She really was...  Oh, she's still looking.  She's still looking.  Come on.  Come on.  Turn around.  Self-centered whore.  She goes, it says free puppy, and it's cold out.  It's cold.  All right.  Okay.  Here comes two guys.  They'll look.  They'll look.  All right.  These guys are going to look.  It's obvious.  Here.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Please lift it.  And now he's looking around to see who did it. 
[02:17:30]  That's the greatest bit ever.  I love the box of cucks.  They make believe they didn't see what was inside.  Okay.  A guy pushing a hand truck of New York Magazine.  No.  No.  He's done.  Oh, how great is this?  Oh, that's fucking funny as shit.  This is a great bit.  We're getting it all on videotape, right?  Yeah.  Danny.  Any comments on the street?  I'm just looking out for kids is my main concern right now.  Here comes a guy with an empty hand truck. 
[02:18:00]  He looks like the type that might look.  No, he's not looking at the box.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Here he is.  No?  No.  Okay.  This gentleman now.  He's not looking.  God.  New Yorkers don't look around.  What about this old bald guy?  I look like Bob Eatman.  Yeah.  Okay.  Take a look.  Take a look.  He's looking past it.  It's like fishing.  All right.  He's looking.  He's looking.  He's thinking about it.  Nope.  We lost him.  Another couple of gentlemen walking down. 
[02:18:30]  Here we go.  Pointing.  And two ladies dressed in the same coat.  Oh.  Oh, they're coming in this building.  They're adding more.  Hold on.  They're going to add more sides to the box.  Are they?  Maybe one.  Like one on the side.  Okay.  Both sides.  Here's a couple.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  They're looking.  No?  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  They're holding hands.  They're holding hands.  They're looking at the box.  They're ready to lift it up. 
[02:19:00]  It's a couple walking hand in hand.  They pass by the box.  And the guy went, wait a minute.  And pulled her back toward the box.  And slowly opened the lid to reveal the pictures of Cox and the giant dildo they left in disgust.  Oh, that's great.  All right.  Here's a lady.  Oh, come on.  All right.  It's a cold puppy.  All right.  Come on.  It's a cold puppy.  God, I love the ones that are thinking about it.  They almost want to do it.  How many?  How many we get so far?  Three?  Oh, God damn.  It's not bad.  This is a fun bit.  It's like fishing.  Here comes a longshoreman. 
[02:19:30]  It's this guy.  Faggot.  He's got a little arm bag.  Come on.  Look at the box.  Look at the box.  Come on.  You might be able to molest it, sir.  If anything in a box that guy wants no part of.  Here's a bald guy.  He's going to walk into it.  Jesus.  He was holding the bar on his blackberry.  I would have loved it if he tripped and cracked his skull on a box full of cocks.  He impaled his eye on it as he's fucking texting Nambla.  Sorry I'm running late.  I have to testify.  I hear a couple of ladies. 
[02:20:00]  Come on, girls.  Come on.  There's a poor little puppy in there.  What does it say?  All right.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Nope.  No.  Self-centered.  Fixing her hair.  Of course, it's all about you, isn't it?  How about helping that fucking poor helpless uncut cock inside?  Not even looking these two.  Sidewalk, surprisingly busy today.  Yeah, it's good.  A little chilly, which is good because people think a puppy is freezing in there.  Danny, anything?  Any comments?  No.  Oh, a woman with a crutch.  A woman with a crutch.  Please.  Oh, you.  All right. 
[02:20:30]  Why does Danny have no jacket on?  Oh, she's looking.  Wait, wait.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move, guys.  She's going for it.  She thought about it.  She thought about it.  What about it?  Damn it.  Poor puppy sitting there freezing.  I'm actually looking at it like it might be a dog inside.  I might go check.  Oh, look at this.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Here it is.  Guaranteed.  Come on.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Come on.  Look, you little woman.  Here we go.  He's still curious.  He went back.  He's like, what the fuck did I just see? 
[02:21:00]  He's looking in the hole again.  Open the lid.  He thinks this.  He's laughing.  He's laughing.  I don't like that there's a hole in there.  He thinks it's a skinny little white dog standing on its heels.  We've got a problem with our design.  Yeah.  They had to make a lid for the box, and it leaves a little hole that they could peer into.  And the guy obviously saw there was no puppy in there.  He saw the cocks.  Big head of a cock staring.  All right.  This woman.  All right.  We've got three people here.  Come on, puppy lover.  Come on.  Come on.  There's a puppy in there.  All right.  Lady. 
[02:21:30]  Someone on polio braces.  What year is this?  Oh, my God.  Someone's got polio braces.  Where?  What the fuck?  All right.  Come on.  She's looking in her purse.  Come on.  She's a polio brace.  I see her.  Yeah.  All right.  Here comes a woman.  She's holding something.  She might not be able to open up the box.  It's a baby.  Oh, fuck.  Free baby in box?  We need one more good one.  A lot of people coming down the sidewalk in another, like, 15, 20 seconds here. 
[02:22:00]  This guy don't care.  He's got his iPod.  He's straight ahead.  Yeah.  Is he looking?  He kind of looked down fast.  Oh, here's an old lady.  Oh, come on.  If there is a God in heaven, have this 85-year-old piece of shit look in that box.  Oh, please.  Please.  Turn your head.  Turn the other way, you broke down broad.  Look.  We lost her.  Don't notice anything.  People with their Starbucks.  Here's a guy with a Starbucks.  He took a glance.  Notice the Grim Reaper.  How can you not?  He's fucking chasing her.  Oh, here comes an Asian guy. 
[02:22:30]  He's going to smell that there ain't no puppy in there.  And...  A guy pulling his laptop bag.  Oh, oh, okay.  Slowing down, slowing down.  Slowing down.  A couple of people slowing down.  No.  Old lady.  Old lady.  Oh, here we go.  We got one.  We got one.  Come on, look.  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  You can't see.  Pick it up.  Lift the lid.  That fucking hole in the box.  The hole is sabotaging us.  The hole is sabotaging us.  Cover the hole in the sign.  She looked in the hole and saw the cock.  Get the hole.  Cover that hole with a fucking sign that says fucking free puppy.  Yeah.  All right.  Way to do it in the middle of the sidewalk. 
[02:23:00]  Why don't you just put no cock in box before you're at it?  What a dolt.  Why is Sam running across the street?  With his camera.  With his camera.  Sam, hold position.  Sam, what are you doing?  Sam, get back in position.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, dude.  Why don't you put a knee on the sign?  We'll have one made.  Fucking enough.  All right.  Why don't we just get a big arrow?  All right.  Get the camera away from it.  Wait a minute.  Did that dummy just tape the sign to the side of the box?  That means the lid won't open. 
[02:23:30]  No, it'll open.  If he did that, I will shoot him.  All right, here we go.  Make sure that lid still opens.  Yeah, it will.  I don't want to try about it.  All right, now we have to wait for people.  Yeah, and Sam's got to get back in position.  Sam, get back in position.  I'm actually rooting for Sam to get hit by a vehicle.  Oh, would that be great?  Yeah.  All they find is footage of people looking at cock in a box.  Oh.  Oh, great.  NYPD.  Fucking somebody probably called in and said it was a terrorist threat.  Reverend Al will be outraged if Sam got hit.  Especially if a white person did it. 
[02:24:00]  No more commute.  Sidewalk's a little clear.  What happened?  It goes in waves, you know?  This is the big city.  Oh, Channel 4 News just pulled up.  What the fuck is this about?  Yeah, and those cops are making a U-turn.  You know something?  No, the cops obviously are here just picking up barricades that were here for New Year's Eve.  But I think that News 4 guys listen to the show.  Hi, News 4 guys.  And they're looking at the famous cocks-in-the-box bit as it's being done. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah, we'll keep everything on the QT.  Don't worry about that.  Okay.  That is really funny.  Okay, we got more people.  Please send Ernie and Astus in there to investigate.  Here comes a couple.  A young woman.  They stopped.  A gentleman.  They stopped.  Now they don't know where they're going.  Okay, here comes an older woman with a little scarf.  Oh, come on, lady.  Here comes a little lady on a cell phone.  Turn.  How does she know?  She's on a cell phone. 
[02:25:00]  How do these people not notice this huge box?  Okay, here comes a couple.  A couple.  Come on, take a look.  Free puppies.  What?  All right, we might got...  He's looking.  He's looking.  Take the hook.  Take the hook.  Take the hook.  No, we almost had him.  We don't care.  All right, here's a guy with a backpack.  Backpack.  He's looking.  He's looking.  Open the box.  Now he doesn't know what side to open.  You dumb fuck.  Open it from the other side, you ass.  What an idiot.  He tried to open the taped side.  He shook the box.  Maybe we need to get a little weight in there.  How about this fatty?  We've got a dildo. 
[02:25:30]  Come on, fatty.  Open it.  It's free puppies.  All right.  Okay, here comes another lady.  A bus is stopping, as you can hear.  We need one more good one.  Yeah.  Here comes a guy.  Gentleman.  Here comes another lady, I think, in a big furry coat.  Take a look.  Come on, slow down.  Damn it.  Uncaring New Yorkers.  A guy with a bike.  Bicycle.  This should be a tree hugger.  Yeah.  Riding a bike. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Either that or he's a fucking delivery person who wouldn't care if it was an infant.  Oh, God.  We've got a guy with a broken foot.  Giving it a wide berth.  They might be scared of the box.  You know, in this day and age.  Oh, here he comes.  Here's this guy with a bum fucking leg.  God.  He's on crutches doing half a mile.  If he opened it, it scared him and he fell and broke the other one.  Added rule.  He's in the building.  No, he's giving it a wide berth, too.  Oh, wait a minute, though.  The guy with the bicycle stopped.  He's parking his bike.  Is he going to check the box out or is he making a phone call at a pay phone like it's 1985? 
[02:26:30]  He's looking at it.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Take a bite.  Take a look.  Look, there's a big, juicy cock in there.  Did you say that or was that my subconscious?  Oh, all right.  No.  Asian guy just.  Oh, wait.  Another guy looking, staring.  Some guy's looking. 
[02:27:00]  And the bike guy is coming back.  The bike guy is interested.  The bike guy is definitely looking.  He wants to know.  But his kickstand won't fucking work.  He's leaning against something.  Take a look.  Come on.  He's holding his bike up.  He wants to.  He's dying to look at that.  Box of juicy dick.  Oh, here comes a black lady in the fur coat.  He's going to trip over the fucking thing.  Nell Carter.  Look at that. 
[02:27:30]  What are you looking at?  Come on.  One more good one.  Yeah.  Here comes a couple.  Yes.  And another gentleman walking with a little fisherman cap on.  And he's looking.  No.  And he passes by.  And here comes another couple.  Come on.  Look at the box.  She's yapping.  Oh, she sees it.  Oh, wait.  She sees it.  Come on.  No.  She doesn't care.  Oh, wait.  She turned back around.  Nah.  We need Democrats.  She's out of here.  Democrats. 
[02:28:00]  This is New York.  Why is Bicycle Guy just sitting there?  Oh, maybe he's listening to the fucking show.  He probably wants to live in it.  Okay.  Here's a gentleman.  Old guy.  The backpack.  He sees free puppy.  He turned around, but he keeps walking.  They're looking.  People just suspect a trick.  Do you think they suspect a trick?  Yeah.  Free puppy in the middle of the sidewalk.  Hey, we got a few people.  How about gold bars?  A woman. 
[02:28:30]  A woman.  A woman's circling.  She's hovering.  She's hovering.  Other side.  Other side.  Other side.  Other side.  Other side.  Other side.  Open it.  Open it.  God damn it.  There's dick in there, and she fucking couldn't open the box.  Dude, we got to get a weight inside, because she kind of moved the box around and realized  it was empty.  If that fucking idiot taped the box shut, do me a favor, Danny.  Go over there and jiggle that box.  Yeah, I'm going to have to.  If he taped that side.  If that thing is taped shut, I want him fucking shot.  If that fucking box is taped shut.  Because he taped, to cover the hole, he taped the fucking puppy sign down to the side 
[02:29:00]  of the box.  See if it opens, Danny.  Does it open?  No.  He taped it shut.  Oh my god.  Who the fuck did that?  Oh my god.  Who was that?  That was Craig.  Craig.  Craig.  You fucking dope.  I called that 20 minutes.  You stupid fucking asshole.  Holy shit.  How could you be so stupid?  Our whole bit is based on people opening a box, and you fucking taped it shut.  What did you write on the sign?  Don't look in here, cocks. 
[02:29:30]  That'll work now.  All right, Danny.  All right, thanks, Danny.  Oh my god, what a blithering idiot.  No, I want to look at the idiot.  I'd rather look at a complete fucking idiot than people opening a box full of cocks.  We want to tape you to the inside of the box.  Oh.  Holy shit.  You taped it shut.  What a dope.  Travis, call him a douchebag.  Oh.  All right, we're back in.  Wow.  That woman shook the box upside down and couldn't get it open.  I've never seen a woman want to open something so badly. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, we lost two people because of that.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  The object is to open the fucking box.  And stupid me, I assumed no one could be that stupid.  All right, here comes a couple.  All right, here we go.  Back to business.  He's looking at the sign.  Nope.  No, no.  One more good one.  Three people.  Two ladies.  They're looking at the sign.  She's looking.  Puppy.  Nothing.  It's got a register in their head that, oh my goodness, it's so cold. 
[02:30:30]  And then, of course, they get the treat when they open up the box.  Oh.  Help.  All right.  Oh, come on.  We'll get one more.  Come on.  We need one more.  Right now, there's a guy coming.  We can't end a bit this way.  No.  There's a guy coming from the other way.  Somebody's got to look in.  All right.  Guy looking.  Looking.  With a full head of black hair.  Nope.  And, oh, here comes a bunch of people.  Asian.  Lady.  And gentleman. 
[02:31:00]  All right, here we go.  Oh, this old couple.  The old lady looks.  A guy.  Old lady.  Come on.  Oh, she's looking.  Oh, they're looking.  They're stopped.  All right, they're stopped.  Old lady.  Opening.  Opening the box.  Open.  They look inside.  They're looking around.  Oh, the payoff.  Perfect.  The old lady.  I love the payoff.  Lifted the lid to see the cocks inside.  She obstructed the free puppy sign, though, with the other sign.  Yeah, Danny.  Yeah.  Get rid of that sign.  That is the worst taping job. 
[02:31:30]  I can't believe he is that stupid.  All right.  We done?  Yeah, I think that might be it.  Yeah, we'll have to perfect this bit.  But we found we could definitely do something with this.  Yeah, there is such potential here.  Yeah, absolutely.  Such potential.  Let's put a bomb in it like in Platoon.  Hey, this is important.  All right.  As Danny backs away.  Danny's head looks awful from above. 
[02:32:00]  Danny flipping the bird.  I forgot to get everything.  Here comes Art Carney.  Look at this old guy using his umbrella as a cane.  Look at how old this guy is.  Come on.  Look in the box.  We need one more.  Remember what a big cock used to look like.  Even Channel 4 is giving up on us.  Yeah.  Bye, guys.  Take it easy, guys.  There you go.  Look at the old guy.  He's just so tired.  Please open it.  He takes three steps.  He takes three steps and stuff. 
[02:32:30]  He probably wants to report it.  He hasn't seen it yet.  Oh, my God.  This guy drops dead of a heart attack because of Cox.  He's going to...  No, look at him.  He's making his way down the sidewalk.  He's giving it some room.  He's giving it room.  Wait a minute.  He's looking.  It says free puppy.  Come on.  All right.  Old guy's passed.  Oh, here comes a hippie looking chick.  She's got like some paisley top on.  She would want to...  She can't imagine that there'd be a puppy in there.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, here's a whole bunch of people.  Yeah, let's just give this one more because some people might come by here.  Well, we need one more now.  We've got to end on a high note.  Here's a whole group of people.  These people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  This is going to be a group effort.  Here comes...  Guaranteed.  Lift up the...  He just looked right in.  He got a good fucking wide look at him.  He opened that lid wide.  The best part is after they see it, they want to make believe they didn't see it as soon 
[02:33:30]  as possible.  Yeah.  Not acknowledge it.  All right.  Here comes a homeboy.  How weird is it that you know which ones are going to look?  Here comes an older woman.  She ain't looking.  She ain't looking.  That's obvious.  She's a hustling, bustling New Yorker.  Yeah.  Oh, what a scream.  Yeah, we got...  It needs some tweaking.  But it's pretty good.  But this really has potential.  The box...  We could get a tape recorder with, like, little dog noises.  Dude, the upside.  Yeah, yeah.  That would work. 
[02:34:00]  Nope.  Those two have no interest.  All right.  We done, or you want to try for one more?  We'll just wait.  There's one person walking by right here, dragging some wheelie luggage or something.  Is she walking up and takes a look?  Takes a look.  She's looking.  Come on.  Come on.  It's a free puppy.  She's thinking.  No.  We lost her.  Punch her in the foot.  Punch her in the foot.  Even better. 
[02:34:30]  And no.  That's about it.  There's a father and what looks to be his 11-year-old daughter walking down the street.  Danny, don't do anything yet.  Wait.  Wait till the second, because I want to see if...  Oh, hold on.  Someone's opening it.  Oh, he's got a good look.  And he kept walking.  It's a box with a cock and he's on the phone.  Okay.  Let's see how close to losing our jobs we get here.  Yeah, let's go.  Danny, get in position and just yell, don't open that box if she looks. 
[02:35:00]  Because I think a little girl might want to save a puppy.  20 feet away from losing our jobs.  Here it is.  Look at this.  15.  10 feet from losing our jobs.  10 feet.  8, 7.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Okay, good.  She kept going.  All right.  She kept walking.  Oh, here's an old broad.  This would end the bit perfectly.  No, she's hustling and bustling.  Here comes an old lady.  Old broad.  I've got the jacket on.  Look, look, look.  All right, here it is.  Open.  Oh, open.  Come on.  Oh, why did she get so close?  Why did she do everything but open the box? 
[02:35:30]  She's old.  Absolutely.  We're so selfish because we can't stop doing this, people.  We apologize.  We definitely apologize.  If you understood how great this was.  All right, here we go.  Here's three people.  We'll have it downloadable, too.  Here comes a kid.  Oh.  Danny, tell the kid to open the box.  Say, hey, kid, there's a fucking PlayStation in there.  Oh.  That's what we put on next time, PlayStations.  We get a big box of PlayStations we're holding.  Here comes a lady.  Now she's on the cell phone. 
[02:36:00]  She ain't going to open it.  All right.  One more group.  All right.  Are these, is that a young girl?  Yeah, it's too many kids.  Danny?  Yeah.  Is that a kid?  Yeah.  You sure?  Yeah.  She looks 18 to me.  No.  Go ask for her ID real quick before she opens that box.  Hold the cop, that one.  All right.  We're 10 feet away from losing our jobs.  Yeah, they just go.  They're slowing down.  All right.  A couple of feet.  No.  All right.  Passing by.  All right.  Boy, Danny's really making sure that kids don't go near that box.  I like my job, too, guys. 
[02:36:30]  I like my job.  Oh, yeah.  Be fanning Sam in the mornings.  All right.  The two weeks woman from Total Recall.  We'll let her pass by.  Oh, please stop.  One more.  Stop.  Now we have to go one more.  Feed that.  Yeah, feed the dog.  Feed that puppy.  Feed that cock something like your face.  Come on.  Look at it.  All right.  Open that.  Got a Yankees cap.  See, white people are too savvy, man.  They just know fucking street bullshit.  This is bullshit.  Exactly.  Don't be white do-gooders, bro. 
[02:37:00]  Let's pet it.  When this last group goes by, we'll call it.  What's this?  What's this?  Here we go.  Or one more good one.  This guy's looking.  He's looking.  He just gave it a passing look.  Nope.  Come on.  Come on.  There's a little kid in the group, though.  Where?  To our right.  Here comes a lady, a businesswoman in a fucking tan coat carrying a newspaper and hopefully  seeing a cock shortly.  Come on, peek, you self-centered hole.  Look at it.  All right.  Here comes two couples hand in hand.  No, we could do. 
[02:37:30]  They could be tourists.  I can't read it.  Look.  They've got their heads turned.  See, next time we leave it at the bus station because they have to wait for that bus stop.  And they'll think that somebody left it getting on the bus.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good idea.  And that woman ain't looking either.  They're looking in the piano store.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Well, oh, oh.  No.  And here comes two Asian women.  Didn't even give it a passing glance.  Guy in the blue hat. 
[02:38:00]  And then this guy.  And then I swear I'm going inside.  I could give a shit.  Right, Pat.  Here's this businessman.  How about this old lady?  There's an old lady to the right back there.  Yeah, we'll call it after this old lady coming.  There's an old lady coming.  This is the last one.  Sam, she's walking.  Well, Sam can't hear it.  It's so selfish.  All right.  This is just too much fun to watch.  Imagine new listeners right now who just bought XM for fucking Christmas and they're hearing this.  These idiots hang out a window and play jokes on people.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Believe me, this is as good as it gets.  It's a box full of cocks.  Here's an old lady.  She's heading right toward it. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, she's limping.  Oh, she looked.  Nothing.  And that guy.  The guy looks like Kevin Smith.  I guess that's how it ends.  Yeah.  With us just going humiliated and me going to shit.  We got some good video, though.  We got some great video, which will be online.  Opie and Anthony.com.  See you guys soon.  All right.  Let's take a break.  And what time?  Wow.  We spent that much time on that?  It's time to go home. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  We'll break.  We'll be back.  Yes.  My name is Larry.  One of my favorite bits from the old XM Glory days is the old box of cocks bit where the boys took all the pictures of cocks, put them in a box out on the street corner to see the reaction of people when they walk by.  Classic bit.  Love it.  I think you'll enjoy it, too.  Continuing on with that bit, here's part three.  The all-request.  Worst of show.  Tom in Philly. 
[02:39:30]  Tom, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  What happened to the box of cocks?  Why is Elo trying to destroy the show?  Where's Elo?  Yeah.  Can we get to the bottom of the box of cocks controversy?  You get to the bottom of it.  Because I remember what's in the bottom.  A big cock.  What happened to that?  Huh?  What about Ron?  And there was the whole thing about Ron and Fez getting their own channel.  Do you think we know everything that goes on with the Ron and Fez show, sir?  We do.  But listen. 
[02:40:00]  Where is Elo?  Could someone?  He's not here.  Punching out.  Is he coming over here?  I don't know.  Elo is stopping the box of cocks bit.  He rarely stops a bit.  No, he usually doesn't.  Better not.  He called late last night, and there was no fight in me.  There was no fight in me.  Three words.  Right.  So I was like, we'll talk tomorrow.  So we've got to get to the bottom of it today. 
[02:40:30]  I want to know why box of cocks is being banned from the Opie and Anthony show.  I say box of gaping man assholes.  I couldn't agree more.  If they don't want box of cocks.  Oh, my God.  And if Elo doesn't call immediately, I'm going to suggest that the pest start sending email  to Mr. Elo asking why box of cocks is being banned from the Opie and Anthony show.  But I suggest that they send dignified emails.  That's right.  Not ones that are disguised as one thing with a cock photo in it. 
[02:41:00]  Well, you may want to go, what is wrong with box of cocks?  And then you might have to, you know, send a...  It's his OCD.  I knew it.  No, it's not.  It's his neighborhood rubbing off on him.  I knew it.  I knew it.  You lost $50.  You lost...  Here it is.  Right here.  Right here. 
[02:41:30]  I don't care.  I don't care because it's for the guys.  Fuck the guys.  Right in their mouth.  Just give them another $50.  Give them another $50.  I only have hundreds.  Well, give them a hundred, then.  What's with this wrestling thing?  This fucking homo-erotic...  You're rocking his...  I know.  There is...  Oh, there it is.  You found it?  Right there.  There it is.  All right, now we can finally do the show.  Yeah, we can do the show now.  I gave myself a paper cut.  You... 
[02:42:00]  Who is this...  I'm bleeding.  Oh, these are signed by John Cena.  I don't want to throw these.  Paper cuts suck.  Nah, leave it a mess.  I could give a shit.  All right.  Let fucking Ronnie deal with it.  Wowee.  Yeah, that Ronnie's becoming a problem.  I gotta tell you.  Here we go again.  Every few months...  He's really...  Ah, these things gotta happen.  Every few months...  He's really getting under my nerves.  I gotta tell you.  Get rid of the bad blood.  He really, really...  How could he not?  All right, anyway...  Yeah, give me a band-aid. 
[02:42:30]  Where were we?  The faggot that I am.  What are we doing?  Oh, honey, I got a paper cut.  Band-aid for my paper cut.  You two are chatting.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Paul from Long Island will get us on track here.  Paul, go ahead.  Yeah, I guess I saw Elo is cock-blocking the box of cocks.  He absolutely is.  And he better explain himself.  There's no reason we can't do this.  Or at least figure out a way it can be done.  What's the worry?  What is the worry here? 
[02:43:00]  I think I know.  That a child will pass by?  It might be illegal in the community to expose pornography like that.  I'm taking a total stab at it.  Because, like, you don't have to cover the windows.  It's indecent or something.  There might be a real legal reason for it.  Cover the windows?  No, no.  In porno shops, you can't show a cop.  Yeah, I know, but we're not.  You have to actually make a concerted effort to open the lid.  Yeah, man.  We were just taking a little chance.  However...  You have to take a chance every once in a while with this career of ours.  Absolutely.  Imagine being fired from box of cocks. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that would be...  Box of cocks.  How would they put that in the fucking paper?  They would just put a box of pornographic material.  They couldn't print box of cocks.  That is hot and sexy.  Cock of Sam, they would call it.  Put your little band-aid on?  I got to put my little band-aid on my little paper cut.  Oh, imagine if that was on your cock hole.  Oh, ow.  Or crush your eyeball.  Well, I got to communicate out to Elo.  Oh, he wrote back already.  Already?  Where is he?  I thought he was here.  Number.  What do you mean, number? 
[02:44:00]  Number?  What does that even mean?  Hotline.  Oh, you...  Hotline ass...  He doesn't have the hotline number?  I like that.  Don't call him an asshole.  Oh, sorry.  He's still the boss.  Hotline, you fucking...  Oh!  Just give out the number on the air.  It's the way...  Oh.  Send.  Can't we give out...  That's what I do.  Can't we give out the number on the air?  No.  I want a free FM fucking thing like you're wearing.  He rockled it up.  Probably won the same size as you.  Someone's suggesting we do box of cobras instead. 
[02:44:30]  See?  You know, that's probably legal.  As long as people don't look at pornography, we don't care if they get a venomous bite  to the fucking nose.  God damn, that is funny.  I got it.  What?  How about box of duty?  We take a big piece of shit and put it in the fucking...  What's wrong with box of shit?  That's a good one.  Box of shit.  Box of duty.  Wow.  Elo.  We all just bit a huge pile.  How do you guys leave free FM and I'm still here? 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  Why are you there?  I didn't see you.  Yeah, why?  I'm trying to find JV and Elvis.  They're the next big hot thing.  I like that one.  Sorry.  Good one, boss.  Yeah, okay.  Who's calling me from D.C.?  Go away.  I don't want to talk to you people.  All right.  Hi, guys.  Sorry I missed you.  I was in with Mr. Chisano for it. 
[02:45:30]  With little Tommy Chisano?  Yeah, five-year-old Tommy.  Five-year-old little Tommy Chisano?  Give him a gobslapper to shut him up.  He's got to be 11 or 12, though.  I mean, who gets braces at 90?  Stop making fun of me.  Stop it.  He's got braces and he's got to be pushing 60.  I was chatting about his braces to him and he's had them on a few weeks and he's got  to keep on for a year.  And he says, it's very hard to eat.  Why?  Does he start getting hairs down there? 
[02:46:00]  What the fuck's the matter with him?  Who at that?  He's no kid.  No.  He needs dentures in three years.  Right.  I mean, at that point, you just say, who cares?  Take them out.  You know what it is?  I'll tell you exactly what it is.  Tom's the kind of guy.  He's always been like that good-looking guy.  He wears a suit very well.  He's always been that guy.  He's the American psycho guy, but older now.  American psycho guy.  So he takes care of himself and he must have decided at some point that he needed braces 
[02:46:30]  and he doesn't care how old he is or how silly it is to have braces.  Yeah, well, I'm 35.  I need a lot of things, like a few more inches, a few more pounds, but it's like, I am what  I am, you know?  That's a great way to look at it.  I mean, what are you on, the Iraq philosophy?  Exactly.  You need a few more pounds?  What's that?  To lose, he means, right?  Yeah, lose more pounds.  I could always lose weight, go take lipo.  I could do what Bubba the Love Sponge does and staple my stomach.  I mean, I can do all that.  Oh, does he do that? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  He's still around?  The rumor is.  Anyway, so, you know.  Elo.  I know, you're not happy with me.  You and I talked for an hour and then it was the, oh, this ass, I got to tell you what  Elo does.  He's a corporate ass.  He goes, this is how he tells us we can't do one of the greatest bits that we've come  up with in the last year.  He goes, I got some good news and some bad news.  And then he gives some unbelievable news about us and the channel and XM. 
[02:47:30]  I see through this crap.  I know you do.  You're a corporate ass.  What's the good news?  What book did you read that in?  Well, before you give really bad news, make sure you give some really, really good news.  Give some good news.  Even if you have to make it up.  You know what it's called?  It's called the cold prickly and the warm fuzzy.  Is that what it's really called in corporate terms?  Yeah, that's what they'll tell you.  So he gives this good news.  You guys, I got to tell you, you know, you're, I don't even know if I'm allowed to say what  you told me, but basically we're doing, we're like the number one channel on XM, something 
[02:48:00]  like that?  No, you're not like, you are.  All right.  We're the number one channel where we have more listeners than Howard as far as just  the satellite radio goes and this and that.  You guys are doing this and that and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, by the way, can't do Box of Cox.  I'll see you tomorrow morning.  It hangs up.  Click what?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Well, it was the kickoff of the Sugar Bowl, so I had a lot of money on the game.  So I had to go.  Were legal brought into this? 
[02:48:30]  No, legal was not brought in.  Just you.  Just me.  The legal mind of Mr. Eric Logan.  Or the illegal mind.  No, it's actually called the legal prevention mind.  The legal prevention mind.  Right.  Now, what do you see bad about Box of Cox?  Let's discuss.  We'll discuss and I'll tell you the same thing I said to Obi.  I said, listen, I'll be happy to sit down with the rooms of attorneys and run the traps.  But my experience leads me to believe that I know where we're going to wind up.  So here's the issue.  The issue is that you have a box on the sidewalk in Manhattan that has wires, antennas, the abandoned box. 
[02:49:00]  Now, let us forget that that also may bring the bomb squad.  Wait, wires, antennas?  We haven't gotten that far yet.  No, we haven't gotten that far yet.  And even if we had, I think that's still okay.  Okay, well, I think you're going to get the bomb squad in about five minutes.  We have a guy out there.  If the bomb squad came, if a cop came, they would go, no, this is what it is. 
[02:49:30]  We have a guy out there.  Okay, well, here's the problem.  The problem is unsolicited, somebody opening a box in pornographic material under the auspice of free puppies is going to get you guys in trouble.  What if we put free puppy and porno?  Free puppy and porno may work.  How about this?  Free puppy and there's a piece of shit in there which you could just as easily see opening if there was a dog in there.  Free puppy and poop?  No, just free puppy and they open it up and there's a log of shit in it. 
[02:50:00]  I just think you guys are asking for trouble.  How does Candid Camera and all these other fucking shows get away with deceiving people on video?  Well, they're not deceiving people.  Yeah, they are absolutely deceiving people.  Because what happens is, as you know, when they, but first of all, most of the shows rarely, most of the shows don't exist anymore in the way they used to, as you know.  Huh?  What?  They don't exist like that.  How about Punk'd?  Punk'd.  Name another one.  But Punk'd also, by the way. 
[02:50:30]  Borat.  Okay, well, how many lawsuits?  Dayline Pedophile Special.  Yeah, right.  Those guys, those poor sons of bitches.  That's Boxo Cox.  How many lawsuits does Borat have?  None.  One.  No, he has 15 lawsuits.  Fake lawsuits, though.  No, no, no.  15 lawsuits, but everyone knows the movie.  Yeah, but guess what?  Borat's going to pay them to go away.  Not a lot, though.  15, that's a fair trade.  It's a, you know, a fine line.  You've got to judge if the consequence is worth the good for the show. 
[02:51:00]  Now, we're saying that we need to do things for this program, both here and on our FM show, that will, you know, make some noise, shake up some shit.  Until we're able to do that, you know, we're not going to feel good.  No, I hear you.  I understand.  We've got to keep our number one status here, Mr.  That's right.  So we have to work out a way where we can do Box of Cox or something that can be worked out that is just as good. 
[02:51:30]  Fine.  If that's what you want me to do, I will get on it today, and I will come back to you with an answer of how we can do Box of Cox.  I mean, listen, just like Money Snatch couldn't do it over at Free FM or over here, but we can do it over there, and we just figured out a way to do it.  I suggest you talk to the lawyers pronto, or this bit becomes Elo's inbox of Cox.  Oh, shit.  I haven't.  Is that where you print out all the emails we have gotten from Elo and tape them to the inside of the box? 
[02:52:00]  No, it's when I print out all the emails that I get of all the cocks in my office.  There you go.  That's right.  Yeah, no, I know exactly what he meant.  Look at you asking for it.  Oh, please, please send them.  Yeah, no, no.  How about this?  Oh, shit.  I can put marshmallows in it instead and call it Box of Marshmallows now.  Elo's inbox of Cox.  Okay.  You're finally getting it?  Jesus.  I didn't understand that the pests would have been involved.  Oh, you didn't get it?  Oh, no, I got it.  No.  How about unclipped is his preference.  Send unclipped, lots of foreskin preferred. 
[02:52:30]  Well, no, we give him a day to make sure we continue with this.  Yeah, of course.  With this.  Yes.  Pests, don't do it.  One day.  He gets 24 hours.  24.  Before it turns into Elo's inbox of Cox.  I need at least until the end of the show tomorrow to figure out how I can get this done.  To the end of the show tomorrow.  Okay.  Now, that's the weekend.  Come on.  And then we're in Vegas.  You are.  We know your corporate ways.  Look at you.  No. 
[02:53:00]  You got 24 hours from right now.  That's right.  They don't bargain in the Old West.  What is it?  I mean, I feel like I'm Jack Bauer now.  I feel like I'm on an episode of 24.  24, or it's a mailbox full of cocks.  You better start growing that beard.  We turn over to the Chinese people and electrocute it.  So, no, we got to do the beard.  Does anybody remember laughing?  I kill rich, tunt.  Boring. 
[02:53:30]  Goddamn rich, cunt.  That's not true.  I've seen the stock price.  I thought it was going up.  What happened?  Yeah.  Hold on.  What are we doing?  What are we doing today?  It's all good.  I don't know.  We're like 15 and some change.  We went up.  Yeah.  Went up yesterday.  It's not 30.  Is 30 better?  Well, that's where it used to be.  Yeah.  Wasn't it in the 40s at one point?  Oh, yeah.  Ah, you know.  All right.  Well, if I've got 24 hours, let's synchronize our watches. 
[02:54:00]  What do you have?  940.  7 a.m.  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  939.  You want to call at 939 tomorrow.  939.  All right.  When am I going to be tomorrow at 939?  Hold on a second here.  Which, by the way, we're doing the bit tomorrow.  So.  Yeah.  939.  Okay.  I got a media.  Oh, great.  I got the company call tomorrow at 9 a.m.  Lovely.  All right.  All right.  Then call us at 839. 
[02:54:30]  You got 23 hours.  23 hours.  You just cut yourself an hour.  Okay.  We're still on FM.  Fuck.  Pest.  Uh.  Pest.  Go to alert status.  You're on alert status.  Collect your ammunition.  That's right.  Find some of the best pictures of cocks that you can.  Dude, but do me.  Don't get anywhere a cock is in an older gentleman's mouth.  That would be disgusting.  And definitely don't go to any medical sites and get diseased or infected cocks. 
[02:55:00]  Because Elo would hate opening that.  Yeah, that's not fair.  Nothing worse than a syphilis cock.  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  No, do not send them until his.  And by the way, if I get one, if I get one, I get an extra 24 hours.  No, because you'll send it to yourself.  No, that's not a deal.  No, that's not.  The hostage negotiation has a give and take.  If I get one email from a pest.  You don't get nothing.  We can't control the pest.  You know that.  One dick will slip through the crack.  Absolutely.  One dick.  I'm going to tell you, by the time I'm off this call, I'm going to have a dick in my email. 
[02:55:30]  A dick in your email.  Whoa.  All right.  Be careful.  Just you and the emails that Don sent back and forth privately.  Yeah.  Speaking of Don, here it is.  Okay.  Click in my email.  I won't make line of the day, but it could get close.  Ah, no.  Wow.  Some people are.  What's that?  Abandoning the show?  People are upset with Elo.  I don't know why.  Why?  What do I do now?  On the phone.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute. 
[02:56:00]  Let's say hi to Turtle from Whack Bag.  Turtle.  Hey there, Turtle.  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to thank Elo for abandoning the show so soon.  You suck.  Wow.  See how they turn on you, Elo?  Great.  Look at how the pests turn on you.  Wow.  One less email.  Thank you.  You said that.  That's about 20 more.  Exactly.  I know that guy.  He'll send them to you.  Turtle.  Ah, Christ.  So how did I abandon the show?  Because I won't let you do Box the Cock?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  You're the face that's put on this corporate reasoning that we can't do it.  It needs a face.  And that face is you.  Right.  So you know how it works.  You know how the corporate world works.  We know how the pest world works.  Yes, that's true.  They hear that we can't do it.  You made the phone call to Opie.  And that's all they know.  You abandon the show.  That's right.  Box.  I'm just trying to save another Opie and Dopey headline.  No.  No.  If, if... 
[02:57:00]  Ah.  How about, um...  Could we do Box of Shit?  Top of your head.  Box of Shit.  Probably think it's going to be a problem.  How about if we actually give it to a homeless person and say it's a sandwich?  I think there's going to be some health issues with that.  How about Box of Good Feelings and Money?  I like that one.  There's got to be something.  Severed head?  Listen, I mean...  How about Box of Iraq Belly Photos? 
[02:57:30]  Hmm.  Sexy.  What could we put in there?  What about a...  A cake.  What about something that was called...  I remember a sex toy called Bottoms Up.  It was nothing but a big rubber ass.  And you couldn't really see the asshole unless you spread it open.  So it's just a rubber prop ass.  What about that?  How about the pest suggests some other...  Some other box-os.  Yeah, box-os. 
[02:58:00]  Box of Elo's head.  No.  Although, they're ready.  Boy, do they want to send you those fucking pictures.  They're chomping at the bit.  Oh, yeah.  Their index finger is getting all...  Oh.  You know they've just gotten the worst possible dick pictures.  As opposed to those real luscious ones they could be sending.  Can we send one picture to your email right now?  Fine.  Send one.  All right, Pess.  Just send one email.  You guys figure out amongst yourselves which one you want to send. 
[02:58:30]  Somebody.  To send just one.  Someone will get the honor of sending just one.  Actually, you know what?  I only want it to come from Doug Outdug.  He's like...  Doug.  Doug.  He ain't going to send you just one.  No.  No, I'm not, but he should be.  He'll send you a real one severed in the mail.  What's in the box?  From the head of Wack Bag.  I'm just trying to go to the top of the pest pecking order.  All right.  Well, you can't take away one of our greatest bits.  I will get on the phone and I will give you the official legal answer as to how we can do it. 
[02:59:00]  You know what bit we're going to do in 25 hours if we can't do this?  Sex for Sam.  Great.  Well, again, I don't think that...  Only churches on the list.  That's right.  That's great.  And mosques.  Mosques.  Mosques.  And synagogues.  And synagogues.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Well, let's say hi to Larry in Minnesota.  Larry?  Hi, Larry.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Larry.  You got Elo, the boss of XM, on the air. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, I was thinking of a bit.  You guys could just take a whole bunch of pictures of Elo.  Yeah.  And then just call it Box of Pussies.  What do you think of that, Elo?  Box of Pussies.  Yeah.  But don't get alarmed because it's not actual like Pussies.  It'll just be pictures of you.  That's right.  It was.  Ah, nice one.  God, how do you turn?  Well, someone is suggesting Box OXM stocks.  Oh, wait.  That's an empty box.  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[03:00:00]  That's over the line.  Let's say hi to Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy?  Does anybody remember?  $30 a share?  Now, listen, Mr. Elo, I am going to forewarn you that if you kill this bitch, you will  have a box of gaping assholes just for me.  Oh, gaping.  Jeremy will be sending Box.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  Well, I mean, listen.  I mean, I'm glad to see the love.  Well, you know how this works.  I know how it works. 
[03:00:30]  It's give and take.  You give.  We take.  Yes, I know.  And there's never a gift back.  I'm very well clear on that.  It's about time we get a little take, yes, because we've been giving and giving and giving.  We need to work this out.  It is a great, fun bit.  Everyone enjoyed it.  No one was damaged by it.  Even the people that saw the box of cocks that lifted that lid just walked away.  Listen, all it takes is one, as you guys know.  And all it takes is crossing the street and getting hit by a trolley car. 
[03:01:00]  That's right.  Or laying down on a subway track.  It can happen to anybody in 1850.  Look, we need to do the bit.  Understand.  I'll do what I can.  All right.  I mean, that's all I can tell you.  All right.  8.30.  All right.  Oh, no.  We can't do 8.30.  Yeah.  How long is your meeting tomorrow?  Well, it's Nate's call, so I'll be on like a 9, so I'll be off by 10, probably.  What are you guys going to be talking about?  Oh, no. 
[03:01:30]  What's Nate's email?  Bob Jones.  Listen, don't do that one.  No.  I think I would recommend you guys have a meeting with the man before you do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who is he?  I hear you.  How come Nate doesn't like us?  That's not true at all.  All right.  I just think you should meet him.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll meet him.  We'll work that out.  I know you will.  All right.  All right.  Well, I've got a lot of work to do, apparently.  Oh, you do?  Well, I've got to get on the phone with attorneys and figure out how to do cocks. 
[03:02:00]  He has to make that phone call.  I know.  Right.  I mean, this is what we were going to do.  I love it.  Just so you're clear, I'm now going to call the general counsel.  Yeah.  All right.  And we have a few litigation issues with the company, I'm sure you're aware of, right?  Not really.  Yeah.  Well, can we conference you calling this lady?  That would make for some fine radio.  It's a lady?  No, it won't be the lady.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'll try to steer clear of that.  I'm serious.  Can we take that phone call on the air? 
[03:02:30]  Well, according to FCC regulations, since they're actually the experts in that, they would  know that they'd have to grant permission, so let me ask first.  Ask permission.  We'll just listen in.  That's all we want to do.  Yeah.  We want to see how you handle something like this on the corporate level.  Well, I mean, if you did that, you guys would actually have a little bit of appreciation  for what I do.  If I did that, I doubt it, but you never know.  It may stop one email.  I appreciate you, Eric.  I know you do, Jim.  I meant Iraq. 
[03:03:00]  Such an ass.  All right.  We've got to eat cereal.  Go eat cereal.  Much more important.  All right, boss.  Goodbye.  Bye, Eric.  In the last segment, a caller requested this, this.  Yes, my name is Larry, and one of my favorite bits from the old XM Glory days is the old  box of cocks bit, where the boys took all the pictures of cocks, put them in a box out  on a street corner to see the reaction of people when they walk by.  Classic bit. 
[03:03:30]  Love it.  I think you'll enjoy it, too.  It's not over yet.  We've got more.  Here's part four.  Are we at deadline?  How close are we to launch?  We're at launch in, what, T-minus 15 seconds, about?  He didn't even call?  Is he nuts?  We made this perfectly clear yesterday.  All right.  Pass in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
[03:04:00]  Launch your cocks.  Launch your cocks.  Repeat, launch all cocks.  Launch.  Flush the cocks.  Flush the cocks.  Take us to Defcock 5.  Turn your key, sir.  Turn your key.  Turn your key, sir.  Launch that cock.  I would like to know what kind of cocks are being sent. 
[03:04:30]  You can give the show a call.  That would be nice.  Someone's suggesting Elo's been sitting there all day with his pants down, waiting for the  pictures.  Wishing the deadline was 7.30, so he could start jerking off already.  Oh, boy.  Those cocks are flying.  We probably just gave the guy an alibi.  Beautiful.  Well, how's he going to tell, like, Hugh Pinero and Nate and all those guys, like,  God, listen, I have to leave this meeting for a minute because I'm going to have my inbox 
[03:05:00]  flooded with cock photos if I don't go call this shit.  Too late.  That's what I do for a living.  Too late.  That's my boots on the ground daily job.  Tony from...  Can't take them back now.  These cocks are fucking flying.  Absolutely.  Tony from his Subaru.  Cocks away.  Cocks away.  Cocks away.  As the Enola game rolls out onto the tarmac, the deadly cargo of cocks in her belly.  So many cocks that John Kennedy died. 
[03:05:30]  I mean, what's his name?  Joe.  Joe.  The young Joe.  Young Joe Kennedy, headed for the presidency.  Welcome to your first one.  Thank you, guys.  Awesome.  That's awesome.  It's about time, man.  Jesus.  Awesome.  I know.  I thought he was infallible.  Motherfucker.  This guy just sent his picture.  It's Ed in Jersey.  Ed?  Hey, how's it going?  I had a successful launch.  Oh, it was great.  This thing is bent at like a 65 degree angle. 
[03:06:00]  Did you encounter much resistance?  Any flack?  Any fire?  No.  No kickbacks?  Clean mission?  No AAA.  Clean mission.  You flew your sortie?  Fly a few more sorties.  Okay, I can do that.  More cock.  Can you describe the cock you sent?  It is.  He's standing over a bed, and he has this cock that's bent at about a 65 degree angle, completely  hairless, a la Jimmy.  Beautiful cock.  And you know, the only response you're going to get from ELO is an email with a T-Y in it. 
[03:06:30]  T-Y?  What do you mean?  Thank you.  The old T-Y.  Dave in West Orange.  I love the smell of semen in the morning.  We're going to pick that cock up and drop it right down where you need it, Captain.  Someone's yelling, oh, the humanity.  Let's see.  Let's go to Jeremy.  Jeremy.  I want you to put that cock right in his inbox. 
[03:07:00]  Jeremy.  I want you to get your case to be up for that one.  Hold on, hold on.  Just letting you know that I sent some nice, juicy black cocks, too, and those gaping  pics for you, Anthony, and some ass caves, too.  Ass caves.  I sent some ass caves.  That's good.  You've got to soften the beaches a little.  Run, Charlie.  Let's get a turtle from whack.  Charlie, don't send cock pictures.  Hey, guys.  There are four pages on whack bag of nothing but cock pics.  We've got at least 75, 80 of them. 
[03:07:30]  They've got gangrene, syphilis.  Oh, nice.  Cock tumors.  Any man pulls his cock out like that could drink out of my canteen at any time.  They're cock pictures.  My boys love them.  Stupid Elo.  He didn't think we were serious.  Oh, he's done.  Hold on, we've got Joe in New York. 
[03:08:00]  Keep the music going.  Joe, what's up?  It's time to cock and awe.  Oh, it's cock and awe.  Wonderful.  We're in the middle of cock and awe.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Down goes Elo.  Down goes Elo.  Yep.  All those cocks being sent over.  In every way possible.  He goes around.  His favorite music.  His favorite music.  Let's get a Dennis in North Carolina.  Dennis.  What's up, bubble boys?  Hey, Dennis.  Elo's saying, I love the sight of cocks in the morning. 
[03:08:30]  Looks like victory.  Or something else.  Boy, what a scene in this movie when you first saw this movie.  It's brilliantly shot.  Flying from water over to the beach.  This music blasted.  Brilliantly shot.  Oh, fantastic.  Great cinematography.  And the music was lovely.  Duvall was young and handsome before he became old Mitchum-ish.  Come on, sports fans.  Send those cock pictures.  Shooting that woman in the back of her black pajamas.  When he said, I'll ram it right at that dink bitch's ass. 
[03:09:00]  I like him taking a little swig off his cup of coffee with his first or the ninth Air Cav logo on it.  I'll take this one.  I'll take it, yeah.  Just a cockpit.  Just a cockpit.  Lance, you okay?  Let's go to Dennis in Canada.  Canada even getting involved with the cock and awe.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  It's a coalition of the willing.  I love it.  He says, that's right.  I sent them a bunch of broken cock pictures. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  You know, having sucked way too hard and then they fucking hit something and the cock breaks up.  The snapped cocks.  Yeah, we've heard about that on Ron and Fez lately.  Exactly.  That's what gave me the idea.  I sent them a bunch of busted cocks and shit.  It was so funny.  And I got a bunch of operations, too, where they try to enlarge the penis and just slice the open.  Went wrong.  I love it.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  It's kind of hard to say.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now. 
[03:10:00]  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  A cockalypse now.  It's flying over.  Hey, Joe from El Paso.  Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah, this gives a whole new meaning to you got mail as in M-A-L-E.  Oh, M-A-L-E.  You've got mail.  Very good.  It's Chris from Mississippi.  Chris.  Hey, it's Chris.  Hi, guys.  Love the show.  I think we need to change Elo's name to Swallow.  What?  Do we?  A swallow.  Are you sure? 
[03:10:30]  Oh, good Lord.  Yeah, let's go to Kirby from Wack Bag.  Kirby, what's up?  I asked an Elo's cock picture.  It's like, it's an extreme close-up.  The head of the cock is pointing right at the camera.  There's a tarantula on the cock.  And the tiniest little drip of semen is coming out of the head.  It's either the very beginning or the very end of an orgasm.  What a great photo.  Launch your cocks.  They're launching from all over the place.  Next wave.  Next wave.  Let's go to Joe.  Launch your cocks.  Joe, what's up?  Joe.  This is Joe from New Jersey. 
[03:11:00]  Hey.  First time corner, long time listener.  Hi.  Dude, this is the fucking gayest show ever.  I know.  And we're proud of it.  We've got to launch cocks.  You ever see a cock come apart like that, man?  Holy shit.  Let's send the bitch cock pictures.  Let's send cock pictures to the whole village.  Do it for Manny and Sal's cocks.  Let's say hi to Pat in Boston.  Pat, what's up?  Eero gets the cocks.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, very nice.  Wow.  Baghdad Bob is calling.  Baghdad.  This is Baghdad Bob.  There are no cocks invading the XM compound.  Well, apparently not one picture has made it through.  Did he own frunkus?  Yeah.  Frunkus.  Let's get a bill in Jersey.  Oh, we will stay the course, gentlemen.  We will stay the course.  You sinked your cock, Elias.  Wow.  The phones are just lit.  Hotline is ringing.  It's Eero. 
[03:12:00]  That's how the cock laughs.  Let's see how Operation Cock is going.  Let's talk to the enemy.  Eero.  Are you guys having fun yet?  Hi, Eric.  Eero.  Hi.  How are things?  Couldn't be better.  I bet.  What's wrong, Eero?  Nothing's wrong.  Have you checked your mail?  All 242 of them, yeah.  That's just the first wave, my friend.  Right.  Well, you know, by the way, the other thing that I think that, you know, good God. 
[03:12:30]  Who the hell did you say that?  He can't even.  God.  What was that one?  That is, that one, this one is directly from Cum Cock UK.  This is Ivan.  Look at that.  The British are always willing to help us out.  That had to be a real pioneer of this shit.  Whoever got Cum Cock UK was really ahead of the game.  Cum Cock.  He really knew that this internet was going to take off.  Eero, could you just read off maybe some of the subject lines that are coming in? 
[03:13:00]  Resume.  Resume.  You're costing me cash, cock.  Not more cock.  FBA cock.  More cock.  Let me scroll down here.  Free puppies.  That was not what it was.  There you go.  Then we're getting creative because they know that, oh, he put cock in it, he won't answer it,  so now I've got 2007 budget.  Good, good, good.  Because the message board has been chatting with each other trying to get a battle plan together, 
[03:13:30]  so they probably, you know, make sure he opens up here.  Something business-oriented.  What's in the budget one?  What's in the budget one?  Oh, fuck.  Hold on.  Shit.  Hold on a second here.  Oh, great.  This is a guy who actually does take a picture of his cock from his cell phone.  He wasn't home, but he had to participate.  Yes.  He didn't line at Starbucks.  That's like an insurgent.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That was an RPG or whatever it was called.  Yeah, an RPG. 
[03:14:00]  Hey, Anthony.  Improvise the IEU, whatever.  Yes, he loved it.  Anthony, is your email up right now?  Uh-oh.  Are you forwarding them?  I'll forward you the budget cock.  All right.  Let me pull up mine.  The other thing, too, now, Opie, you, I think, and Anthony both,  you've talked to my assistant here at the office, right?  Yes.  So I had to bring her into my office, and I said,  now, listen, we're going to have to have a delicate conversation,  and she thought she was getting fired.  Uh-oh.  And I said, 
[03:14:30]  You're going to see a lot of cocks today.  You're going to see a lot of cocks today.  I need you not to sue me.  I need you to understand that I'm not sending you the cock,  but there will be a lot of cock.  I am not kidding you.  I'm having a hard time logging on to my email.  Everything's running wildly slow.  I think there's too much cock.  Yeah, because the entire email server at XM is going to break down here.  Oh, damn it.  This is amazing.  Here's an example.  This is great.  This is almost like we're doing a damage assessment before the next strike. 
[03:15:00]  You know how you have to look at, see if the buildings have been damaged enough.  Yes, that is a fine hit.  That's a smart cock.  That is smart cock.  All right, Anthony, I just sent you the one.  This is a more cock one coming your way.  More cock.  Yeah, and there's some very interesting ones.  Actually, very creative.  All right.  No, it hasn't come through yet.  Come through yet.  Your cock hasn't come through yet.  Ah, more black cock.  Here we go.  Oh, God. 
[03:15:30]  This guy's bent over.  He's shoved all of his hardware back between his legs.  So it's just his balls are resting on his asshole.  Oh, is that wonderful.  Here's one.  Urgent.  Urgent.  Urgent.  What is it?  Oh, I'm sure he's sending it over.  I'll tell you what urgent.  Here, urgent.  Hold on.  Let me open it up again.  I think my computer's going to crash.  The other thing great about this is, oh, nice. 
[03:16:00]  It's a guy with a giant rod that's not nice.  You won't like it, Jimmy.  It's not groomed.  And he's squirting some sort of KY juice on this thing.  Okay.  Urgent.  Fine.  Well, now we...  That goes to Anthony Cumia.  Okay.  Forward.  We have to...  Now we have to do a little diplomacy here.  This is what Nixon did to get the Vietnamese to the table.  Bomb the shit out of Cambodia with cocks. 
[03:16:30]  That's right.  And then Vietnam came to the...  Can I just take a phone call real fast, though, before you go to plan?  Is this oral cock now?  Greg in Oregon.  Greg, you're on with Elo.  Hey, Elo.  I was wondering if you were enjoying the Battle of the Bulge.  Battle of the Bulge.  Boring.  Punching out, boys.  Elo.  Boring.  Oh, God.  We have a very diverse audience where they're getting pictures from certain websites. 
[03:17:00]  There's a gentleman who looks like me.  Oh.  When he's not looping up.  Okay.  Now they're getting good.  Yeah, why?  I need a door to a caddy.  That was my old email to you.  I love how Elo's got his own sound effects for his own phone call.  Okay.  Now this one, by the way, I'm going to give it on the cock.  Oh, I think it just screws up and up here. 
[03:17:30]  Son of a bitch.  I just screwed it.  Hold on.  You better not have sent that off.  He hit forward and it went to the boss.  Yeah.  Hugh.  Oops.  This one is...  This one is...  Ah, good.  Uh, from tfrolix at anyop.com.  Again, of course, that email box has probably sent one email.  Uh, and it was to me, subject line, Bob Edwards' contract dispute.  That's pretty good.  Wow.  That's clever.  Yeah, that's the best one.  Uh, this one just in, Ethel Listening. 
[03:18:00]  Uh, oh, this is a nice one.  Letter from Mom.  Uh, new one just in, Reference Inquiry, and Urgent Attention Required.  Any, uh, emails from Oprah yet?  Uh, no, but I'm sure they'll be coming shortly.  Oh, yeah.  How many are there total so far?  Uh, I've got a...  Let's see.  Uh, it's hard.  I've got to get...  I've got, like, since I've been on the phone, I've gotten 90 new emails.  So it's probably... 
[03:18:30]  Not counting when I was...  What was great is I was actually in a very senior-level meeting,  because I've got to get ready for this call here in a few minutes,  and I'm, like, looking at my BlackBerry.  And I'm, by the way, I know I've got to get out of this meeting to call you guys.  And I looked down, and I had, like, two unopened messages,  and it went to 112, and it was, like, cock, cock, cock.  I'm like...  You know, it's...  Right.  You missed your deadline.  And I had...  I had Carlisi calling me like a madman, like, leaving me messages.  Please forward every picture to me.  Every picture forward to me.  Yes, I'll name the people who there are pictures of.  I recognized them. 
[03:19:00]  I'll help you out.  You better call.  I mean, I didn't know any good way to stand up at this meeting and go,  listen, I've got to go.  I've got to take a call about cock, so I couldn't.  So, anyway...  Well, did you do any discussion...  Have any discussions about our Box O'Cocks contest?  I did have...  We did.  I did have a lot of discussion.  I talked with legal counsel, two different legal attorneys here,  and got all the answers, of which none of them are going to like.  Well, all we want to know, is there any way we are going to be able to do this Box O'Cocks, 
[03:19:30]  maybe with a different theme somehow?  What did the lawyers tell you?  It was...  Keep sending cocks.  That's right.  We aren't ready for the bargaining table yet, buster.  He's still a little too snippy.  Yeah.  He's still a little too snippy.  I don't know.  Those beaches are still a little dangerous.  Another wave, another salvo, another sortie.  There you go. 
[03:20:00]  That's what you get today.  All right, Louis C.K., Carolines, all weekend long, here in New York City.  We're going to have a party of Carolines tonight, and maybe tomorrow night as well,  before we fly out to Vegas.  All set up, Kenny?  I'm going to call Greg Charles.  Oh, you haven't done that?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Why, Kenny?  What are you...  Greg has always been a saint.  He's a good boy.  He is.  You want to do the dump report before we go to break?  Because you probably want to get out of here, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Today's dump report is worth reading, because Louis C.K. might have set a record. 
[03:20:30]  Here's today's dump report.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Librarian glasses go on.  Yeah.  Well, Opie started off the show correctly at 6.15 a.m.  He said, he also sucked Marlon Brando's car.  That's going to make it.  That didn't squeak by?  No, I thought maybe that would have...  It had been established that we were talking about something else.  Yeah.  Yeah, Wally Cox, right? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  7.20 a.m., Mr. Norton, what the fuck?  That slipped.  It really did.  My apologies.  7.40 a.m., Louis C.K.'s debut.  Masturbated to that several times.  People, if you can't say masturbated on the radio...  I thought that was okay on the radio.  It used to be.  It used to be.  That one is so stupid.  I think Jack Benny was the last person able to use that word.  Masturbate.  Masturbate.  And then Louis...  Oh, Rochester.  Could you jack me off? 
[03:21:30]  I want to masturbate.  19-year black face.  Ah, those are the old golden days.  And then Louis clarified it by saying masturbated to that video.  Oh, I had to...  Oh, Rochester.  Someone masturbated on my fiddle.  Jesus, how old are you?  I just know the classic.  Yeah, you do.  7.49 a.m., Louis C.K., angry weird boners at 10 years old. 
[03:22:00]  I think it was angry and weird, yeah.  You know, that kind of puts the boner in a bad light.  I'm the fact that you...  A boner in a bad light.  Sorry, what?  7.56 a.m., Opie chimes in again with cum collectors.  That's right.  Cum collectors.  To describe all women.  This next one annoys me.  Oh, I know.  These are the worst when I dump out of these.  8.08 a.m., little Jimmy. 
[03:22:30]  Dear Faggot, Norton, during discussion of a gay guy's computer.  You can say faggot, but not in reference to gays.  And congratulations to the fucking stupid terrestrial radio.  I'm glad XM heard it.  That's why you're fucking...  Everyone is starting to hate regular radio.  That's why.  You can't say faggot in the context of a gay thing.  And that's a CBS thing.  That's not the FCC.  No, again, all radio stations around the country will just make up their own rules now because  they're so scared. 
[03:23:00]  I got a sexual harassment case against Eric Logan.  What?  He's sending me pornographic material.  Nice!  To your BlackBerry.  To my BlackBerry email.  Oh, my God.  He just sent me 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...  I got a bunch of...  Dude, he has no idea what he's getting into.  That's wrong.  Let's call HR on our boss.  Let's send him cock pics.  All right, continue there, Kenny.  Is that for mine or yours? 
[03:23:30]  For mine.  Well, you forgot how to say it, but...  Let's send them cock pics.  Didn't do any better.  I'd call 30 if I didn't get mine.  8.15 a.m., Louis C.K. said fuck.  Okay.  8.17 a.m., Louis C.K., five penises in one mouth.  That's just too many for one mouth, Lou.  Four would have been all right.  That was just because you were greedy.  Did Al type penises correctly?  Yeah.  Is that the plural?  Penises, yes.  Penasia is the way I like to... 
[03:24:00]  Oh.  That's my plural for penises.  Penasia.  What do you think?  Was it like fish?  You could just write it the same way?  Five penises in one mouth.  Or peni.  8.22 a.m.  8.22 a.m.  Lots of references to what Louis C.K. thought was sex when he was a kid includes testicles  coming out of the tip of your penis and the girl bleeding during sex for the first time.  Yeah.  That should have been bleeped here. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty awful.  That's disturbing.  That's like fucking eraser head movie type sick shit.  Yes.  You should be hung for that.  Forget it.  That's right.  Next one.  Anthony was a bad boy.  8.24 a.m.  Reference to a kindergarten girl pulling down her panties.  How innocent was my stupid fucking discussion there?  I went down the block as a kindergarten.  I was in kindergarten.  She was in kindergarten.  And she used to show me her hiney.  She would pull down her pants and panties and show me her little white hiney and I would 
[03:25:00]  show her mine.  And it was like a show and tell innocent kid thing.  It's not fucking, you know, it's not now.  I'm not getting kindergarten kids now.  It's okay to look at little girls' asses and vaginas when you're their age.  When you're not their age, Lou.  Stop discriminating.  Sometimes you just want to see how it fits.  Like fucking Chris Hansen walked into the shed.  What are you doing here, Anthony?  I'm in kindergarten, you ass.  Go away.  I'm trying to see this girl's hiney.  I want to look at her coolly. 
[03:25:30]  What did you hope would happen today, Anthony?  Anthony, you came here with a licorice whip and marbles.  Were you going to play?  Yes, Chris.  I'm in kindergarten.  Chris, what do you think?  I'm fucking six years old, Chris.  She's six.  We're looking at each other's hineys.  Did you bring condoms?  What's a condom?  I still say that.  Yes, Kenny.  8.24 a.m. 
[03:26:00]  Louis C.K.  I just pulled it out during a sexual discussion of when he was a child.  I just pulled it out.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  8.26 a.m.  Come and come and come.  During gay John Madden produced bit, it was a clip of Madden saying, come.  C-O-M-E.  Correct.  But in the gay context, it was used as C-O-M.  Wait a minute.  But that's John Madden saying, so he got bleeped.  John Madden got bleeped.  He said, come.  He said, come. 
[03:26:30]  See, in the context that it was taken during the clip when he was talking, obviously it  was during a football game.  But in that bit, it takes on a whole new context where it's not come C-O-M-E.  It's come.  How do you spell delicious?  C-U-M.  But because it was gay-cum?  Because it was gay-cum?  Yeah, it could have been gay-cum.  But what if it was straight-cum?  Say it all you want.  Enjoy.  Yeah.  This next one's annoying, too. 
[03:27:00]  8.38 a.m.  He had to have an orgasm on Christmas Day.  Louis C.K., about a 14-year-old.  Ridiculous.  That's ridiculous.  That's a problem.  Perhaps the age is the problem in that one.  Just fucking annoying.  They worry about the kids.  It's all about the kids.  Louis C.K. again.  I don't know if he set a record today.  Yeah, what is the record?  Do we know?  You know something?  No, I don't think he did.  No, I don't doubt it.  8.42 a.m., Louis C.K. playing with himself in the living room.  This was said during a porn discussion. 
[03:27:30]  Okay, sorry.  I think the record was set by Dakota Fanning.  That's right.  She kept yelling, ouch, ouch, ouch.  And cock tease.  I'll straighten her right out.  I don't care what the birth certificate says.  She knows what's right and wrong.  Oh, my God.  Did you ever see her interviewed?  That's right.  She's like an adult.  That's right.  Let's see what the character would do if this happened.  Snot, no shithead.  Hate that kid.  Apparently, she's got a nude scene coming up in a movie. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  Is she?  Some kind of nude scene, rape scene.  Where there's partial nudity.  Is it a comedy?  It's the new Cedric the Entertainer movie.  Codename, the memory, the memory wiper outer.  What do we got?  Three more?  Yeah.  8.45 a.m.  Louis C.K.  Asked my wife to go down on me.  And then he corrected himself.  Oh, can't say go down on someone.  And then, of course, the last one.  Last one.  Louis C.K. 
[03:28:30]  8.51, that's horse shit.  Good job, Kenny.  Which really is kind of...  It does sum up the whole list here.  That's horse shit.  The way he said it, it's like a my new show.  And the audience yells it at the same time.  That's horse shit.  Welcome to...  That's horse shit.  Pan the live audience.  Trying to go to break.  Don't be looking up at the monitor.  Trying to go to break here, but Elo's forwarding all the emails to me. 
[03:29:00]  You know?  Yeah.  He's forwarding me the cock.  And some of the subject lines are hilarious.  Subject, merger finalization.  How great if one of those was real and he was dumping it?  Just doesn't even look at it.  Sirius gave a great offer and I just dumped the email because I thought it was cock.  Sirius said, like, ten bucks, you can have us.  And he dumped it.  Sends a cock back to him.  XM stock update.  Subject, filthy cum slinging. 
[03:29:30]  Playing hardball.  To take the gay away.  These are some of the subject matters.  Subs.  I just got subs.  Oh!  XM company outing.  God.  Look at this one.  Urgent attention required.  Ethel listing.  Yeah, he wasn't lying.  I'm going to have to put Elo's email address in a spam folder.  Why?  I mean, yeah.  I mean, I'm sure.  Good morning. 
[03:30:00]  Subs.  A lot of subs.  And it continues.  He's sent me like 30 already.  Have fun.  Oh, my God.  I'll just say the 400 I have already and hope that I don't slip in forward to a board member.  Oh, that was the subject.  Tarek Logan.  I have one final thing for all of my friends in the past.  Your mom's box.  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message. 
[03:30:30]  And this is Adam from Arizona.  And I would like to request the end of Super Bowl.  Because it's a great day for sports.  Wonderful day for sports.  Message deleted.  Request for a stuff show.  All right.  I guess we're ready for the ultimate challenge.  I think so.  The problem is we only have two containers and three people.  I understand.  They're going to have to share.  They shared mousetraps.  Yeah, you shared mousetraps.  It's not gay, believe me.  I think we should roll the dice or something to figure out who goes first. 
[03:31:00]  Or something.  How about whoever, yeah.  Paper, rock, scissors, pulling straws.  What?  What do you want to do?  Smallest cock.  I mean.  How do you flip a coin with three people?  Who has the edge?  I think my belt speaks for itself.  That I should go last.  All right.  Matt, that's good.  Good point.  Matt is the champion.  Well, they should flip a coin for who has to go in which one.  They're both pretty full, dude.  There's.  Yeah.  What do you want?  80 bees or 74 on your balls?  Who cares?  The only problem is.  What problem?  I think we should open it up and get the bees into the main container first. 
[03:31:30]  Just so.  Why?  Because this thing's hard to open the safety hatch.  And if they're doing it that way.  Hey, hey, hey.  Here's the problem with that, though.  Once the bees are in there, if they have a problem getting their bag in there before it  gets sealed, there's going to be some loose bees in here.  That's right, Bill.  It's going to be someone's responsibility to open that gate.  That's right.  I don't care what it takes.  I think I'm going to.  Balls go in first.  Gate open second.  Absolutely.  Good point, Ant.  That's what happened at Chernobyl.  They opened the gate first and put the balls in second. 
[03:32:00]  Now look.  We get balls right in there.  Yeah.  Do you want to just have Raphael call heads or tails for who goes first here?  Yeah.  Let Raphael do this one.  Nathaniel.  What is it?  It's tails.  Tails it is.  So.  Fez.  Fez.  Fez.  From Ron and Fez, everyone.  I'm very surprised that you're in the studio.  Well, I got here a little early today.  Can I say, finally, great radio.  My God.  This is what the country has been waiting for. 
[03:32:30]  Super Bowl every single day is what I said.  Fez, we had girls coming in here doing the Whiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Three of them were up on the console.  Really?  Where were you that day?  I don't recall that day.  But yeah, I just happened to get in here early to do some paperwork over some things with  Black Girl.  Just great show, guys.  This is the best.  Why are you pulling up a chair, Fez?  Why can't we do this every day?  Don't you have show prep to do or something?  Oh, fuck that show.  Oh. 
[03:33:00]  Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it.  Yeah, this is the best.  What's next?  What's coming up next here?  Well, we have the ultimate challenge.  This is the grand finale.  The apparatus full of bees.  The guys will be putting their balls in that hopefully airtight rubber top.  And then a gate will be open, releasing the bees into the chamber.  Yeah.  And then they have to sit there until one of them gets stung. 
[03:33:30]  This was one of many prototypes we had to figure out in the apparatus.  This is all Nazi technology.  I know.  One prototype was Jimmy Norton's mouth.  And that didn't work out too well.  Yeah, I don't want bees in my mouth.  I'm glad we all had a laugh at my expense.  Here we go.  Wow, I am now into the frightened portion of the show.  I've never had an anxiety attack.  I think I'm having one.  Yeah, this is a little much.  I'm getting a little freaked out now. 
[03:34:00]  I understand why Tracy left.  Yeah, see?  But you're showing you have more balls than Tracy Morgan.  It's not going to be that.  You can handle this.  She's going to be fine.  She's seen more balls than Tracy Morgan.  Yeah, that's true.  All right, now, how do we decide?  Is it who goes first or both at the same time?  I think, shouldn't it be both sequential?  Yeah, okay.  You're going first?  Raphael.  Raphael.  It's up to you, bro.  You look a little nervous now.  Wait, how do we get him up higher for the camera?  Can he stand on a box?  I'm not even kidding. 
[03:34:30]  Well, the camera, can the camera be aimed?  No, because he's a little shorter, so we want to make sure we get this on camera.  That's all.  If I was in better shape, he could stand on my back.  All right, we are adjusting the webcam.  That's good.  The apparatus filled with, how many bees are in there, seriously?  What do you guess?  Yeah, a shitload.  50?  About 50 bees.  That's fine.  They're not going to bother you.  Wait, and we need the camera where we see their faces, I think, too.  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  Raising it back up.  We could still proceed here.  You don't bother them, they won't bother you.  Yeah, we need to see their face.  I might have to pull out, then.  Yeah, pull out a little, because we're getting video, as well, for the websites that will  be close-ups and all that crap.  Whatever way is most comfortable.  We've got a two-camera shoot happening.  Bill, did you just say whichever way is most comfortable?  None.  Let's say whichever way is most comfortable.  Oh, wait.  None way.  And we need a girl to blow into the tube.  I think they're pretty...  Into the phallic tube.  I don't think you need to.  Yeah, I think they're pretty angry.  Who's going to put their mouth by the tube? 
[03:35:30]  Here we go.  The ultimate challenge.  We've been waiting five years to do this on radio.  Five years in the making.  We finally found lawyers were stupid enough to let us do this.  Gentlemen, take your balls out.  All right.  Let's explain.  Finally.  Raphael has...  Sticky balls.  Sticky balls, yes.  Yeah, they're sticky from the previous competition, which was the wax strip.  You don't have to worry about your penis.  None of us are looking at it from within a few seconds.  Please, don't worry about it.  I don't think that ball is going to fit in the aspiratis. 
[03:36:00]  Well, it better.  You're going to have to jam them in there somehow.  Don't fit.  Bill, push this ball.  Don't fit.  Bill, open up the rubber.  Force them in there.  Be a man.  Open up the rubber and get them in there.  Jam it in.  All right.  Is it in there?  Yeah, it's sticking.  Who's looking?  There you're boss.  Now who's boss?  Yeah, get the other side in.  Don't drop it, whatever you do.  Yeah, hold it, dude.  Don't drop it.  Don't drop it.  That'd be silly.  I don't think you've got enough sack in there.  Yeah, push more sack in there.  Push it up to the base of your, like, schlong. 
[03:36:30]  Can someone get a picture of the apparatus on?  Because it's really fucking funny.  Can you get a shot of that?  Should we do one at a time or both?  Oh, my God.  All right.  They're in there pretty good now, right?  Yes.  Do you have a good seal around your nuts so no bees are going to be jumping out?  Yes.  Dude, can you move your shirt?  We can't see from the side at all.  And there's nutsack.  You can see what's going on in there.  Come on.  I'm going to get fucking...  Nathaniel, get a long shot.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Raphael, smile for Nathaniel. 
[03:37:00]  He says, one more.  Yeah.  Make sure you hold on to that apparatus.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, God.  Is there any bag in there?  Yes.  Can I get signed copies of that?  Is there plenty of sack in there?  Yeah, there's more than enough.  There's enough sack in there.  Okay.  Oh, wait.  Raphael, what are you thinking?  Yeah, right now, what are you thinking?  The obvious question.  What are you thinking?  Are you nervous?  Be honest.  Oh, my God.  Fuck, let's just open it up and get it done with.  You're freaked out, aren't you?  This is the ultimate challenge.  This is why we're all here today.  This is the ultimate challenge.  Way to be a champion. 
[03:37:30]  Ari is covering her face.  How do you do this?  All right.  Ari's doing that girl thing.  I don't know how the gate is open.  Ask for your fingers.  I feel like I'm doing it.  Ask Bill how the gate gets open, because that looks like you're ready to open up the bottom  of the container.  And push the plastic clear lever towards the nozzle front.  Toward the nozzle.  Push it down and towards.  You're going to have to jiggle it a little.  Yeah.  Not too much.  Jiggle the handle.  Push hard.  Oh.  Don't break the thing.  No.  This is Bill's 4-H project.  I don't like this.  Uh-oh. 
[03:38:00]  Uh-oh.  It looks like...  Yeah, don't pull the lid off.  Yeah, you're pulling the lid off.  Bill, you're going to have to do it for me.  Bill, you're going to have to help him.  Just get in there, Bill.  Just be a trooper.  Put your gloves on.  Grab a hold of that apparatus.  We are running out of show.  You're going to buy me new gloves after this.  We are running out of show.  Now, how long is this going to stay on my sack?  An hour.  Oh, shit.  There it goes.  All right.  They're in there.  They're in.  They're in.  All right.  They're in there.  Do you feel anything crawling on your sack yet?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe.  He doesn't know.  Holy shit, dude. 
[03:38:30]  Are they on your...  They're tickling my bag.  Are you kidding?  I feel them on your bag.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding.  They're on his bag.  There's bees on his balls.  Oh, my God.  There's bees on his balls.  Oh, yes.  What?  Ah.  Uh-oh.  What?  What?  What?  Jump up and down.  Give us a jump up and down.  Oh, my God.  Don't be a pussy.  Dude, this is fucking...  This is crazy.  Agitate him.  Yeah, just jump up and down.  Just give it a big jump.  What do you mean it?  Like your twichels.  Boing! 
[03:39:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  We're just waiting now.  Can I just click the clock?  No.  I just want to rile him up a bit.  Yeah, rile him up a bit.  I think contestant number two ought to start preparing by getting his...  I think I just got...  I think I just got stung.  Did you get stung?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I feel swelling.  You won't be able to get it out of the apparatus.  A fizzle help.  Dude, this is fucking...  This is crazy, guys.  This is nuts.  Are you tapping out or what?  No, I'm not tapping out.  I think we ought to get the other competitor ready.  Yeah, I say so, too.  You guys aren't...  This is nothing.  We don't want to run out of time. 
[03:39:30]  Come on.  Just leave your bag in there.  Let the bees crawl around.  Oh, what the...  Ugh.  Right.  All right.  The feeling of the bee on my ball, like, walking around is just fucking unexplainable.  How about wasps?  Wow, he got his sack in there pretty quickly.  Wait, now you got to open up the thing.  Yeah, you got to open the gate.  Oh, God.  The tickling.  The tickling?  I think you're going to know when he gets stung.  I think they're going to stick to the... 
[03:40:00]  I think they're just nibbling.  They don't realize that there's a threat.  It looks like another nest to them.  All right.  Steve from Connecticut is trying to open up the hatch.  Sweaty, nervous nest.  To release the bees into the apparatus.  How come Bill could do it so easily?  He was testing this out.  He was working on this apparatus the whole afternoon.  Bill.  Help him out.  Help him out.  Help him out, son.  All right.  Bill will release the bees.  Could you move the paper towel roll?  Oh, fuck.  Oh.  What happened?  You getting stung?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Hold on.  I'm going to get a break.  You broke the tube. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, there's a breach.  Oh.  Is the tube broke?  Yeah, the tube snapped off.  Don't let him out.  They're not coming out.  It's secure again.  All right.  Dude, you got stung?  I'm opening this first.  Oh, great.  Good blessing him.  All right.  He's opening them up.  Master Poe is making a weapon.  Stop it, Jimmy.  Jimmy started smacking me like I got a bee on me.  Fuck.  You got stung? 
[03:41:00]  What honeybees, son?  They're harmless.  What happened?  It's not opening.  It's just nature.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What?  You having sex with the bee or what?  Yeah.  Let me shoot them.  This kid's going to come out.  We're going to get a bee.  Can't get that gate open?  Damn it.  One of our apparatuses is busted.  Guy's waiting.  Balls in hand.  Oh, come on, man.  Just a big stack of balls hanging around.  A big handful of nutsack.  Oh, those bees are...  What happened, Bill?  Here we go. 
[03:41:30]  All right, Bill.  There you go.  Bill's good, man.  Bill's good.  You got it, Bill.  Bill's a fucking professional.  Give him a second to...  All right, get your nuts in there.  All right, all right.  Oh, wow.  There's bees in there already.  That's all right.  He's definitely got some of your nuts in there.  All right, he's shoving his nuts into the bee apparatus thing.  No bees getting out.  Ow.  Oh, Steve is already agitating the bees.  Fucking Steve is tapping them, daring them.  Steve is tapping.  He's daring them.  All right, now do you have a good amount of sack in there?  Yeah, he's got his...  I see it hanging in there.  Dude, he's got a leg in there. 
[03:42:00]  All right.  Not as much as I can get in there.  Now lift up the phallic-looking thing and tip it back so all the bees get in there.  Mm.  Did you get stung at all, Raphael?  Twice already.  I swear to God.  Now tap the bottom of your apparatus on the table.  T-bagging some bees.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  T-bag a cup of coffee, not bees.  Do you want to tap the apparatus?  You got to shake it to get them flying around a little.  I think it was licking my balls.  Licking.  Licking. 
[03:42:30]  These have tongues?  Oh, there we go.  Are they on there?  What are they doing?  These suck.  What are they doing?  Nothing.  They're just fucking hanging out there.  I think you got to jump up and down and get them kind of levitating.  There you go.  Steve is rocking around.  Oh, he's getting them.  Steve is jumping up and down a couple feet in the air.  And they're still just laying at the bottom, all fucking...  Well, they probably can't breathe anymore.  Yeah.  Whoa.  That'll piss them off.  You feel them around your ball bag or anything?  No.  You should have painted your sack like a beautiful flower. 
[03:43:00]  I can't see it on my balls with sugar and shit.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Where are those wasps?  You may need them.  And you got stung.  Twice.  Twice.  Yes.  Are they moving around your ball bag still?  Uh...  They're...  They're walking around.  Definitely.  Look at them agitating.  I did.  All right.  Hey, I got stung twice here with my...  I'm trying to get stung.  They won't let me.  Oh, I see one walking up on the side.  Here we go.  Maybe he's getting closer.  One was flying around in there.  I won't agitate him for a minute.  See what they do. 
[03:43:30]  They got to kind of get acclimated to their new surroundings.  Perhaps that's it.  All right.  They're, uh...  That worked for me.  Oh, one's crawling up the side again.  Could be...  Could make contact with your nuts soon.  Now, Opie, what I'm worried about is when I remove my bag from this unit...  Yeah, we're all going to be worried.  It's what we're all worried about.  Yeah.  That's why they have to be soon.  My balls are sticky.  I mentioned it several times.  So you think maybe a couple of bees might be stuck to your nuts?  Yes.  So we'll just swat them.  Well, you know what?  We're running out of show, so we got to get Matt involved. 
[03:44:00]  So, Raphael, why don't you pass over the apparatus to Matt?  Hopefully...  Hello.  Make sure the bees...  How many bees are on your balls?  None.  EMT, guys.  Check him out.  See if he got stung or not.  What's that?  What the fuck are pubic hair stung?  What the fuck?  Ah, you see him on the toilet all the time.  Yeah, pull off your pubic hair and pass on the apparatus.  I say the wasps.  You got to go for wasps.  You got to get the wasps.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Just do it over the jar.  Matt's shaking them up. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, Matt's a fucking poop.  He is shaking them up.  Watch the tube doesn't fall off of that one.  Yeah, let's be careful.  All right.  Now we're ready to roll.  Oh, geez.  Oh, yeah.  They're rocking and rolling.  Look at these.  They're coming right up.  They're coming right up.  What happened?  Huh?  You might have...  The bees might have suffocated.  All right.  Here we go.  Matt is throwing his ball bag into the apparatus with the bees.  Get the wasps.  That's a nice contraption.  Now we try.  Very well thought out.  Yeah.  What the fuck? 
[03:45:00]  All right.  Uh-oh.  He's trying to squeeze his ball bag in there.  I'm in a little trouble.  They didn't bother you, huh, Steve?  No, hold up.  Oh, my God.  Watch the...  Don't pull that tube out.  Oh, he's shaking them up now.  Get them all angry.  Hoo-hoo.  He's copying off them.  He's shaking them.  You've got to get them up by your...  Fucking break.  You're dead.  No, they're not.  They're all...  Now they're fucking...  Look at them.  They're moving.  This whole thing has literally left me speechless.  Literally.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm trying to think of something.  It's like...  It's actually taking all the words out of my head.  Yeah. 
[03:45:30]  Wait a minute.  Will blowing into them help?  No.  Most of them are lying on their back.  They're not doing anything.  All right.  Well, they're fucking...  All right.  Matt's sacked.  What?  You get bitten, Matt?  No.  Matt is...  Matt's got the apparatus on.  He's moving the apparatus.  He's trying to agitate the bees.  These bees are fucking creeps.  All right.  Let's go.  I've got a wasp.  I've got two wasps.  You want to put them in?  Yeah, bring in the wasps.  All right.  Let's see if we can get...  Uh-oh, Po.  I just got mine in.  Yeah, well, Matt, you can keep yours on. 
[03:46:00]  Ooh.  There's nothing worse than a wasp.  How are we doing this?  Uh, Po, when you open that lid, don't let them fly out.  Yeah.  These have to go.  Oh, here they come.  Here they come, Matt.  Oh, they're pissed.  Yeah?  Here they come.  See them?  Yeah, they're all over the...  Oh, Jesus.  They're moving up the wall of the apparatus.  No, you should just put the ball...  No, no.  Leave the wasps in the jar.  They should put his balls over that jar, bro.  Leave them in the jar.  What's that?  Leave them in the jar, dude.  We can see it.  And we can just put it...  You can just keep...  Put his balls in there.  Don't dump him in there.  Ari's got to go.  Guys, I'm going to head out. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, yeah.  Thank you so much for having me here.  We'll have you back again.  We'll have you back.  I hope your balls are okay.  Oh, they're on me.  They're on me.  Yeah, dude.  There's only one wasp in each one.  We only have five minutes of show left.  Five minutes of show.  I just put them...  It's only one.  Oh, what happened?  Nothing.  There's like four of them on me.  Crawling on your...  There's four on your nutsack?  Let's see if you can go the longest.  Yeah, champ.  Put the wasp.  Wow.  Where's Raphael?  Getting checked out.  Okay, he's fine. 
[03:47:00]  All right, put your balls in the one.  He's fine.  Just got stung twice in the nutsack.  What do you want me to do?  Are we going to go head-to-head with each other?  No.  Guys, we are running out of show, so...  We don't have time to do much of anything.  Right in.  And just make sure you get a nice seal.  Oh, shit.  Get a nice seal there.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, ow.  All right, there...  I got stung, yeah.  You got stung?  Did you get stung?  Oh, no.  Where?  Wasp crawling by...  It's coming up.  You got stung in the sack?  Yeah.  You smell him. 
[03:47:30]  And now the wasp is...  The wasp is now making its way up the jar.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  It's just in the way here.  Oh, no.  How close is the wasp?  Oh, shit.  I can feel him feeling on my nut.  Like, his feelers come in and around and he walks away.  Oh, shit.  Jumping, yeah.  Matt is jumping up and down.  And he's got a wasp in a jar.  Christ.  That is...  Oh, yeah.  That's sick.  Is he on your ball bag?  He's getting...  No, he's walking back.  Get back. 
[03:48:00]  They're trying to get stung in the balls by a wasp.  Yeah.  They're attempting.  The wasp is disappointing them by his lack of willingness to sting their testicles.  Can I have the jars?  When you're done, I'm making jelly later.  Sure, guys.  I'll sign my jar for you after the show.  There we go.  Hello.  Oh, yeah.  Here he comes.  Boy, are you pissing that thing off.  Hello.  Hello.  Is he up on your sack?  He's right under my fucking sack.  Oh, goddamn.  Come on, you fucking cunt.  Wow. 
[03:48:30]  Excuse my English.  Dirty talking.  Sorry.  Yeah.  These wasps suck.  We need more vicious bugs.  Let's try this in the spring.  Where'd you get these fucking bees from?  Berkeley?  What are you doing, bro?  Oh, he's...  He's really just fucking up the mosques.  Oh, God.  He's shaking it up.  Why does it have to be on their backs so that the mosques fall onto them?  Good point.  You know what, Bill?  You raised an excellent point.  Someone quick.  Up on the console on your back.  Fuck it.  I'm not kidding.  All right.  What does he got?  What do you got? 
[03:49:00]  These are four.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Jesus Christ!  What?  Oh!  Holy shit!  Hey, uh...  Holy shit!  Hey, champ.  That came out of nowhere!  Hey, champ.  Why don't you take that one?  Holy crap!  Wait, no, no, Paul.  Leave it like that, Paul.  Champ.  Holy shit!  Why don't you take that one?  He's obviously a fucking...  He's no longer playing games.  Did you see him jump in?  Holy shit!  Holy shit! 
[03:49:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  He pops up to the top.  Wait, where's that...  Not yet.  What do I want to do?  Where's that last jar?  He's got...  Oh, there you go.  Okay, he's got...  Now he's got the pissed off wasp.  He's got the pissed off wasp.  Is he going right for the nut?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, my God.  That just ain't right?  That guy...  That guy...  Steve jumped like I've never seen anyone jump before in my life.  Oh, my God.  Who brought another jar in?  What was in the other jar?  Four, uh, small paper wasps that have shaken up vigorously. 
[03:50:00]  You want to go for the four paper wasps?  Sure.  When are those fucking gonna get me started?  That one wasp is really pissed.  This wasp has a taste for it now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No.  That's how it works.  God damn it.  No, not that jar.  Not the nest.  Plug it up.  That thing is gonna...  Nest.  Nest.  Nest.  Nest.  Oh, no.  Nest.  Nest.  Oh, God.  I'm petrified.  Can't put you going over the wasp nest.  We got a minute.  We only have a minute left in the show.  A minute left in the show.  Oh, he's going with the entire wasp nest.  A minute left in the show.  Holy shit.  When the show ends, just end it, because we can't give plugs or anything. 
[03:50:30]  Plug that shit up.  We only have a minute left in the show.  Can we go a little long?  Is it possible to...  No, we can't go long?  No, it cuts off and it'll go right to...  All right, we got a minute 15.  Matt has put the jar that has the nest of bees.  Don't drop it if you get stung.  Don't drop it.  Holy shit.  Jump up and down.  Jump up and down.  This is the grand finale.  Matt.  The current ball champion.  He has his ball for the wasp nest.  He's got his balls in a jar that has a little wasp nest. 
[03:51:00]  Wow.  Anything?  50 seconds.  They're on it.  They're on it.  They're on it.  Here they come.  Oh, shit.  Here they come.  We have 40 seconds left in the show.  He is basically shaking the jar upside down right onto his nutsack.  Oh, god damn it.  You put the entire nest against his sack.  Oh, my God.  The whole nest is against his sack.  30 seconds left in the show.  What courage.  30 seconds.  The cameras are rolling.  This is for the title, Matt. 
[03:51:30]  You are a madman.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hold the jar.  Get the jar.  Again.  Where's the cover?  Put the cover.  Oh, my God.  Give him the cover.  Give him the cover.  Give him the cover.  Oh, my God.  The listener requests voicemail. 
[03:52:00]  Next message.  This is Admiral Dan.  And I remember an intern that the boys had back in the XM days.  I think his name was Noah.  And he dressed up real nice and fancy all the time.  And I think it irritated Opie to the point to where he had to throw chocolate-covered strawberries that Paddy brought on his very expensive shoes.  And it was funny because his daddy made him quit shortly thereafter. 
[03:52:30]  Bye-bye.  Message deleted.  The all-request.  Worst of show.  I know it's in studio.  Why do you think he's gay?  He's saying he's not gay.  Exactly.  He looks like a huge fag.  Big, fat fag.  If he says he's not a fag, I guess I'll take his word for it.  But he looks like he belongs on Christopher Street.  He's just village gay. 
[03:53:00]  Just gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.  Well, you told me you heard my song.  You thought it was gay.  Why is that?  I don't think I've seen it.  Oh, my God.  The voice is a little...  I got to tell you, Noah.  The voice is a little, you know...  That's pretty funny.  She just said, she goes, I don't think I have to explain.  Like, he's speaking for himself right there.  The song wasn't gay.  What did you think was gay, the song?  Julia?  Julia was...  Flaming.  Flaming.  Do you like his outfit with the pink shirt and stuff today? 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, I think it's nice if he...  If it's a gay thing, you know, it looks really good.  For gay?  Yeah, for gay, it looks great.  I don't see why it's gay at all.  I think you have to explain why you think it's gay.  But you also have on sunglasses, and it's like...  I always wear sunglasses.  That's gay, too.  I know a lot of people that wear sunglasses.  And you're wearing pink.  You're wearing pink.  Yeah, so this shirt is like what P. Diddy and, like, Fat Joe. 
[03:54:00]  That's like the hot style.  Yeah.  Not necessarily gay, just because it's gay.  How about P. Enos?  One thing I'm noticing, though, that is very not gay about him,  I'm noticing your fingernails are a little dirty.  Now, gay guys are usually very meticulous.  Yeah, but his are dirty from holding ass cheeks open.  Oh, my God.  And you think he belongs on Christopher Street? 
[03:54:30]  Definitely.  And why is that?  I don't know, but you've got to watch out for the AIDS.  Sonny Cockett.  Oh, my God.  He says he's not.  So let me ask you, I mean, besides seeing the way I was dressed,  when you first met me, do you think my personality was gay, too?  Well, you look gay, too.  No, no, not my looks.  I was saying my personality when I first talked to you.  Yeah, you sound gay.  You look and sound gay and sing gay.  You kind of got the gay...  You're just gay.  You kind of got...  I got to say, you got the gay voice. 
[03:55:00]  Definitely.  It's kind of a...  Yeah, you got this, like, very feminine...  It's, like, swishy...  You talk like that.  You ever hear a gay guy talk?  Yes, I do.  And have you ever said, wow, that guy sounds gay?  Yeah, absolutely.  That's what you sound like.  Like, you don't hear that?  Nobody's ever told me that.  Stereotypically, you have the gay voice.  You have the gay voice.  Your mannerisms are very gay.  Nobody's ever told me that before.  Ever.  They've thought it. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, they're just not being honest.  Or they are so much more gay than you that you can...  People are honest with me.  Welcome to reality.  All my friends' roommates are straight.  I mean, they would tell me if they thought that I acted or talked gay.  No, they wouldn't.  They would just laugh at you behind your back at parties.  That's true.  And tease whoever your roommate was.  Where's your roommate?  Come on, man.  Shut up.  You see the way that guy talks, man?  Yeah.  All right, well...  It's very gay.  Wow.  Jesus. 
[03:56:00]  Francine.  We really don't know.  Yeah, we don't know.  Well, we have no hard facts to back this up.  I'm going to have to say I'm still on the fence with Noah.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm not really sure.  Noah's on the fence, too, and he's got the post stuck right in his crack.  Two feet dangling, not touching anything.  On the other side of the knot hole in the fence on his knees.  That's a pleasant thought.  Waiting for that prize.  All right, well...  Prize.  How much is your outfit today, by the way?  Yes, give us a rundown of what you're wearing. 
[03:56:30]  What are you wearing?  Those are cool boots.  These are Gucci boots.  How much are the...  Stan corrected.  How much are the...  How much are the Gucci boots that guy he bought you?  Pretty expensive.  They were about $500.  Pop one up over here if you could...  $500.  Leg up there.  How high up did I go, sweetie?  Not that high.  $500?  We got $500.  We put the...  For Gucci boots.  Yes.  And I got a banana jacket.  This was a...  I didn't see the boot.  Opie wants to see the boot. 
[03:57:00]  Put it on the...  Put it on the counter.  We're on the counter.  I'm going with you.  There you go.  Oh, Jesus.  He hit it.  That is a...  He just threw a chocolate-cover strawberry at his boot.  At his $500 Gucci boot.  It smashed right on the top.  Oh, what a dick.  What a great shot that dick has, though.  I really appreciate that.  Thank you.  It smashed on his $500 Gucci boot.  That was great. 
[03:57:30]  And what about the jacket and the shirt?  Give us the details.  The jacket and the shirt are both from Banana Republic.  Banana Republic?  Yes.  So they're relatively inexpensive?  The jacket was $250.  $250.  Wait, is anyone doing the math?  $750 so far.  Yeah, $750.  What about the shirt?  The shirt was $80.  $80 for the shirt?  This t-shirt was $40.  $8.70.  $40 t-shirt?  For a plain t-shirt.  Yeah, but that's what's happening out there with the t-shirts.  And the jeans are diesel, so they were like $140, $130. 
[03:58:00]  Dude, your outfit is over $1,000.  $1,010.  What about socks?  You got chocolate on the sleeve of your thing, though.  It popped up.  No, that's some kind of thread thing.  Oh, okay.  That's not chalk.  What is that?  Some thread.  I don't have no idea.  All right.  You might have to burn the jacket now.  How much are the socks?  Yeah, what about your socks?  I just wear normal white socks.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  No dress socks?  No dress socks.  And what about the sunglasses?  How much are those?  The sunglasses are $250. 
[03:58:30]  Can I ask you a question?  Are those button fly pants?  Yes, they are.  I have the same jeans.  What?  Diesel button fly?  Yeah, those are actually cool jeans.  Thank you.  How much did you pay for them?  Probably $140.  You spent $140 on jeans?  $140 for a pair of jeans.  Yeah, from me and Bob Kelly went shopping one day.  I bought a pair of diesel jeans, yes.  What do you think $140 jeans are going to get you, Jimmy?  No, I actually like them.  They're actually comfortable.  They look good on stage.  They are very comfortable.  Oh, stage wear.  All right.  But no, yeah, that's what I wear.  No, that's okay. 
[03:59:00]  Then I'm fine with it.  For the stage, that's one thing.  Yeah.  I thought you were just wearing them around, thinking you'd feel better about yourself  just walking the streets dressed in $140 jeans.  No, not wearing on a Tonight Show.  And I'm not bashing you.  I'm just saying I would be the same way.  I wouldn't wear it, because what the hell is that going to get you?  But Tonight Show, on stage, fine.  Where will you be performing?  Fellatio.  Me?  The hands just went up in the air.  The hands went up in this fashion you would only see at La Cage.  Like somebody was robbing me, robbing you. 
[03:59:30]  That was just like, I'm not just confused.  I'm not performing.  See, your hand motions, your mannerisms.  I, too, am not saying you're gay, because I have no hard facts to back it up with.  So you say.  But everything you do.  And what did so you say mean?  Well, you said you have no hard facts to back it up, but you're coming up with hard facts.  No, they're not hard facts.  It's all circumstantial evidence.  Okay.  But hard facts is like a picture of you blowing a guy. 
[04:00:00]  Well, no, that, too, can be taken.  Of course that's hard facts.  But the way you move your arms when you're talking.  I don't walk around like this and do this.  That would be more masculine if you switch your wrist like that.  No, I never.  I don't do this.  You kind of do when you talk.  The hand on the hip thing.  I'm not doing that.  But you were.  And you will again.  And your voice, I mean, they're just saying.  Guys, there's two regular guys standing out there that don't know you from a hole in the wall. 
[04:00:30]  Okay.  What's.  Which one?  Does he seem gay?  Got to wait for the delay to catch up.  Look, turn around.  Look at the blithering idiots sitting out there looking at us.  One in a Phillies hat, one in a Yankees hat.  Yeah.  Okay.  The guy's making the universal signal for a blowjob where you take the empty hand in  a ring, do it, and put your tongue on your cheek so it pops out, would you?  Is this the gay judging paddle over here? 
[04:01:00]  Well.  The American Idol paddle?  The guys kind of know.  They're saying, yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Well.  They're saying you're a swish.  All right, Noah.  Thank you.  Anytime.  I will defend you.  I have no idea.  I think we should switch shirts.  Oh, very funny.  He should put the low self-esteem and we'll give a blowjob for a friendship.  Oh, I don't have low self-esteem, so.  No?  You should.  Well, thank you, Shib.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  His outfit's like $1,200 today.  $1,200.  Mine is maybe $40. 
[04:01:30]  Nice jeans.  No.  I got the same one.  Oh, you totally nailed him.  Of course I did.  Did you ever see that girl again that you were talking about the other day?  Remember the one you hooked up with?  Went back to her place?  No, I have not.  You haven't seen her again?  What was her name?  Yeah, what was her name?  Well, the one that I didn't remember or the one...  Oh, the one you didn't remember.  What was your girlfriend's name?  Girlfriend's name?  Are we talking about Julia?  All right, Julia.  But no, there's the girl and you met her. 
[04:02:00]  Where was that again?  Where did I meet her at?  Yeah, where did you meet her?  Central Bar?  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's...  I forget where that is.  It's like 9th Street in the village.  Where did she live, though?  Yeah.  No idea.  No, you went to her place.  I don't remember.  You don't remember?  Oh, yeah.  Where?  Where?  It was like 30th Street between 8th and 9th.  Are you helping them?  No.  I don't remember what you're talking about. 
[04:02:30]  This is the best real ever.  Oh, man, this is the best.  No matter what, no matter what.  He just looks all like, oh, I got to remember what I said.  Yeah.  No one believes any of it.  Okay.  Thank you.  No problem.  Thank you.  I'm sorry, you had sex the first time where?  Sex the first time where?  At a friend's party in high school.  Right.  It was a party.  On the couch?  Yes.  In front of people.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Why do I have to go through this memory test?  No, no, no.  Just not the best.  I forgot.  I'm sorry. 
[04:03:00]  Right.  Okay.  I have a bad memory.  That's great.  Just what we thought of.  I forgot.  No, no.  I remember.  It was 30th.  Well, that's the best part of the thing.  It's like, just when you think you got him, he comes up with the answers.  He comes up with the answers.  That's the last possible second.  It hits me off every time.  It hits me off every time. </pre>
