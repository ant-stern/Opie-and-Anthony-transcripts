<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off course into vulgar and offensive territory.  The broadcast began with a discussion of Howard Stern's purportedly fake radio bit featuring David Lee Roth, with guest Sammy Hagar criticizing its execution.  This transitioned into listener feedback on the segment and listener-submitted "Assignment America" audio, specifically a hilarious clip of someone spoiling the new Harry Potter book to unsuspecting people, highlighted by a child’s angry reaction. The show then tackled the resurgence of Scooby-Doo's popularity, alongside listener calls, and criticized the animation quality of the original series.  A Page Six item about Owen Wilson's alleged penchant for licking women's buttocks ("Butterscotch Stallion") sparked a humorous discussion. The segment also included listener calls about the Red Sox and Yankees, and an audio clip of Bob Kelly describing a knee injury.  A comedic Dungeons & Dragons-themed song concluded this portion.

The next segment opened with a discussion about the massive sales of the new Harry Potter book, followed by disparaging remarks about J.K. Rowling's wealth and books in general. A random anecdote about the origin of the name "Hogwarts" was shared, followed by criticism of a staff member's clothing choices.  A caller then launched into a series of "Ben's hog is so big" jokes from a Drew Carey audiobook, leading to criticism of Carey's monotone delivery. The conversation returned to J.K. Rowling and Katie Couric's interview, sparking a lengthy, graphic, and vulgar discussion about women's aging and makeup.  Jimmy's birthday was mentioned, with various gift requests, including a bizarre saran wrap and underwear-related one.  A comedic interlude about a coffee errand followed.  Ron and Fez's upcoming appearance was mentioned, leading to a discussion about the hosts' coffee preferences and a derailed joke about Jimmy's diet. The Couric interview was revisited, with a humorous and inappropriate analysis of her use of Harry Potter terminology, prompting listener calls and further vulgar tangents.  A listener shared an offensive joke.  A discussion about a Richard Cheese song ripoff concluded this segment before a string of celebrity calls – Sean Penn, Samuel L. Jackson, Cameron Diaz, Jackie Chan, and Jimmy Norton – each providing brief, often humorous and unexpected interactions, frequently involving requests to recreate famous lines from their films. The segment ended with a comment about an unfinished story.

The third excerpt began with a humorous anecdote about a woman's aggressive reaction to a bad phone call.  A caller, Martin, then introduced a news story about women using Botox in unusual places, leading to sexually suggestive jokes. This segued into a discussion of listener-submitted analogies for female genitalia.  A call from Owen Wilson, mistakenly claiming a five-year search for Wes Anderson's buttocks, followed.  The discussion moved to listener-created "Pat Battle clips," and a commercial for XM Satellite Radio interrupted.  A significant portion focused on reminiscing about a former mentally challenged Viacom employee, Eddie, with his incompetence and workplace mishaps described in detail, including the use of racial slurs.  A Harry Potter-themed game with listener-submitted definitions ensued, featuring humorous and inappropriate twists. A caller mentioned the hosts' Today Show appearance.  A discussion about a man's death during sex with a horse followed, with graphic descriptions and sexually suggestive jokes, including a bizarre comparison to Spock.  The latter half showcased pre-recorded XM Satellite Radio show IDs with various celebrities (Owen Wilson, Aaron Magruder, Charisma Carpenter, Clive Barker, Elvira, Tom Kenny, Aaron Gray, Hal Sparks, John Kane, and Ren), highlighting their struggles with the lines and the hosts' inappropriate comments about them.  The segment concluded with a discussion about Richard Hatch and Stan Lee, including further offensive comments and jokes.  The hosts' frustration with the celebrity IDs and booking process was evident throughout.


The fourth segment featured Stan Lee's brief appearance, hampered by technical difficulties with the DAT machine affecting several celebrity voice-overs, including Thomas Jane.  The main focus was an interview with Wilmer Valderrama promoting *El Muerto*, with Big Kev as the interviewer.  The conversation included crude jokes and a discussion about *March of the Penguins*, devolving into graphic descriptions of harming penguins.  Big Kev expressed frustration with the show's booker and their inability to secure high-profile guests, leading to a discussion about guest booking difficulties.  A comedic bit involving "Everybody Wang Chong tonight" followed. Listener calls spurred discussions of movies, pornography, and television censorship.  A clip from Hulk Hogan's reality show and a call from Frenchy, discussing his life, were included.  The segment concluded with audio of penguins and the hosts expressing anger and displeasure.


The final segment started with angry, sexually charged messages on the "F.U." line. Jim Norton, promoting his stand-up shows, and Frenchy, discussing his brother's restaurant, were in studio.  Henri, a caller, engaged in a highly offensive and sexually explicit verbal altercation with Frenchy, including homophobic slurs, with the hosts and Frenchy responding similarly. Other callers, some with equally offensive language, phoned in. A discussion of one of the host's medical appointments occurred. The segment ended with a lighthearted "what we learned" segment filled with vulgarity. Big Kev was mentioned as having been in the studio earlier.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning, everyone.  This is Sammy Hagar.  The Opie and Anthony show has been replaced.  It is now my show.  I'm the new king of the Opie and Anthony, I'm the new king of all media, Sammy Hagar, sitting  in for Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie and Opie.  Howard Stern is doing the worst fake radio I've ever heard in my life, a bit.  Stop it. 
[00:05:30]  You know how to do fake radio, I know how to do fake radio, because he's a lazy, I'll be honest, I'll be honest, the bit could have been a home run, Anthony, an absolute home run, but Howard Stern doesn't know how to do that type of radio whatsoever. 
[00:06:00]  And the whole thing fell apart, and he had to go on the radio earlier than he wanted to.  What a douchebag.  Yeah, it was awful.  People were buying it, calling us. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, writing instant feedbacks.  I'm seeing all kinds of things.  Oh, he's whining on the air about saying goodbye.  Oh, my God.  Diamond Dave is making my ears bleed.  It's a train wreck.  Basically, what happened, I guess, on Howard Stern's show this morning, you know, people tuning in to listen to Howard, and David Lee Roth was in his place, because there's this rumor in the radio world that David Lee Roth will be taking over for Howard Stern.  First of all, that's a false rumor.  Yeah.  That the media is buying. 
[00:07:00]  It ain't gonna happen.  No, they're not putting David Lee Roth on K-Rock.  So, Howard's been on vacation for two weeks, so all of a sudden, David's in his place this morning.  Yeah.  Saying he's the new king of all media.  And he had some stripper as a sidekick that didn't speak English.  And then they had an announcement that was Howard's voice.  It was so obvious.  Yeah, it was supposed to be some manager or some management person over there at K-Rock. 
[00:07:30]  And if you listen to it, it was Howard doing it.  At least get someone else to do the announcement.  I don't know.  And then Howard calls David Lee Roth's show.  Yeah.  To say goodbye to his listeners.  Like, that would happen.  Dude, I was cringing so bad in the office for him.  Bad acting.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Ugh.  If you did it right, you could have got press all over the world.  Yeah.  You could have got a huge shot of press today and tomorrow. 
[00:08:00]  And then come back on the air Tuesday, right out the bit.  And then when you really go away from commercial radio, then you get the headlines again anyway.  That's how you do it.  He's too self-centered to actually let somebody else be on the air that long.  But he couldn't even commit to the bit.  No.  And I guarantee now his kissing listeners are now going to call and go, oh my God, I really thought.  Oh, dude, you had me, dude.  Oh my God, dude, you had me.  I really thought, oh, I really thought it was over.  Oh, shut up.  I thought I couldn't believe it. 
[00:08:30]  I turned on, I heard Dave.  I was like, I don't believe this.  I'm sure they're kissing each other's asses right now.  Dave, you did a great job.  Boy, that was really bad.  It was really badly done.  I mean, at least you as a different announcer.  That was pretty, uh, we're listening and going, wait a minute.  What?  Yeah, because they had, like, the fake GM or what have you.  Yeah.  Saying, the Howard Stern Show has been replaced by David Lee Roth. 
[00:09:00]  And it was Howard's voice.  He was, like, doing a voice.  Yeah.  But it was him.  What, you got it?  Huh?  Where, right here?  This is what they were playing this morning for, like, an hour.  Listen, it's Howard's voice.  Good morning.  This is Edward Lewis, the operations manager and head representative of WXRK Radio.  In recent weeks, there have been lots of rumors and speculation about the Howard Stern Show ending before December.  Well, the speculation is over.  And regrettably, so is the Howard Stern Show. 
[00:09:30]  Viacom decided that due to Howard's move to another broadcast medium, we should change the nature of the morning broadcast as rapidly as possible.  You're a big, fat phony.  Number one, to give the audience its new host for morning radio for the next five years.  And secondly, to give our advertisers the chance to see that there is hope to put on an entertaining radio show without Howard Stern.  Stop whining.  So, without further ado, we give you our new morning host, David Lee. 
[00:10:00]  Stop whining.  David Lee Roth.  David Lee Roth.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Could have been a good bit, Howard, but you couldn't commit.  You're too lazy to really pull it off now, aren't you?  Yeah, that was really cringeworthy.  Yeah, we saw it on the New York radio message board.  Someone announced, you know, oh my God, he's done.  He's over.  So, we flip it on and right away, Opie spotted it. 
[00:10:30]  I got to give you credit there, Opie.  Right away, Opie spotted some shenanigans.  I assumed they were just stunting with the Dave thing, but, uh...  Now, the Dave rumor is false.  Yeah.  It has been false, but, you know, the media will buy anything, so they went with it.  Mm-hmm.  You know.  And Howard, you know, he was smart enough to go with it, obviously.  Yeah.  But he didn't commit.  No, you got to do this for like a full day.  He could have had the whole media talking today.  Yeah.  With a bunch of production and everything.  But like you point out, his ego is so massive that he can't handle listening to David Lee Roth doing his show. 
[00:11:00]  No, not for a whole show.  Never happened.  So, there you have it.  Yeah.  Good fake radio by Howard Stern.  Yeech.  Hey, guys.  It's Eric.  Where's Jim today?  I just wish I could have done Sammy Hagar's voice better.  That's what we should have done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's supposed to have somebody doing Sammy Hagar.  You could have been, uh...  What's his name?  The bass player. 
[00:11:30]  Anthony Michael...  Uh...  Hall?  No.  Uh...  Michael Anthony...  Mark Anthony?  What?  Michael Anthony Marsh?  What?  Who's the bass player, Van Halen?  Yeah.  Um, not...  It's not Eddie.  Michael Anthony.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know why you're trying to put a little...  Michael Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Well, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  The only virus spreading across America.  And we couldn't be happier. 
[00:12:00]  This guy wants to start off with an awful new character.  Eric in Boston, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Um, I got two things for you.  Yeah.  First is, uh, I was taking a walk on Friday, and I saw a live news crew, and it was, they  were broadcasting in, like, two minutes, so I had no time to do an assault on the media.  But, get this, the story was about some kid who died at a local high school, but, you  know, he was Mexican, so it's okay.  And in the background of the shot, there were a bunch of kids just sitting there. 
[00:12:30]  I asked them what they were doing there.  It turns out, the reporter, because the story was about a kid who died, the reporter found  a bunch of kids in the area and got them to sit in the back of the shot and asked them,  swear to God, asked them to look sad.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I couldn't, I couldn't even believe it.  It was just a most ridiculous...  It looks sad.  Oh, believe it.  Oh, believe it. 
[00:13:00]  That was, it was unbelievable.  And the second thing I got, I was hoping that I could audition to be a new character on  the show, even though it's kind of an old bit by now.  No, it's not really an old bit.  None of these bits ever get old.  Oh, that's cool.  They come and go, and you guys can bring them back when you feel like it.  So, what's up, Eric?  All right.  I wanted to do Ben Sparks doing movie reviews and then becoming excited and going off on  something completely irrelevant.  All right.  Let's give it a shot. 
[00:13:30]  Go ahead.  All right.  Dote, Dote, Wedding Crashers just came out in theaters.  It's got Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn.  Vince.  Vince McMahon.  You know, I used to watch the WWE.  Stephanie McMahon had small tits, but then got implants and then had big tits.  I was lost at sea with a girl named Stephanie once, but then the wind picked up, so we tied  some sheets around my hog and sailed to shore.  It was crazy and insane.  Dote, dote.  Hey, Matt, what's going on today, buddy?  Matt.  Yeah, yeah, ho.  Whoa.  Hey, guys, I'm shaving. 
[00:14:00]  Sorry about that.  You're shaving?  It's calling from a septic tank.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, so listen, guys.  You speakerphone guy.  This is so messed up.  He did this 2004, April, on April Fool's Day.  He was doing the same thing with a new morning show because the FCC finds.  This is the same fucking thing.  He's lazy, dude.  And he's very lazy.  And I knew it was a David Roth imitator because before you guys came on, I was listening to  his show and it was bailing.  And this guy was doing prank calls. 
[00:14:30]  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  What is somebody...  This guy's saying, congratulations, shit dicks.  You were the only tools in America reporting the Stern story as real.  Nice researching.  Um, what?  Did you fucking...  Did you listen to the beginning of this show?  Are you kidding?  Do people not listen that much?  It says, congratulations, shit dicks. 
[00:15:00]  That was nice, at least.  You were the only tools in America reporting...  People don't listen.  They don't listen.  I started the show by saying I'm Sammy Hagar, you ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What an idiot.  And Howard's going to try to spin it now and make believe, oh, no, it was supposed to  sound fake the whole time.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Dave, what's going on?  Oh, that was the worst bit ever in the history of radio.  All right, Dave.  They're falling all over themselves, how great they are.  Oh, really?  Oh, you got to hear it. 
[00:15:30]  I keep flipping back.  They're like, oh, we fooled everyone.  Even ourselves.  We're so good.  We're so good.  All right, Dave.  He sucks.  Thank you.  I don't think Fred's going to tell you that your acting was good today, Howard.  Tell him, Fred.  Your acting stinks.  No wonder you're not doing movies.  Did one, but you played yourself.  That's easy.  Move.  All right, we should move on to some stuff here.  We got lots going on.  Absolutely.  No one caught my attention as we were preparing for today's show.  Anthony was the dude. 
[00:16:00]  Is this guy from Dallas?  Remember we threw an assignment out there?  Assignment America.  The Harry Potter assignment.  Yeah.  The book came out, and it's selling like hotcakes.  Like griffle cakes.  It's selling like hotcakes all over America.  A quarter million copies an hour or something that was going.  Wow.  Is that what they're saying?  When it first came out, yeah.  It was really a lot of books.  You know what?  I was told the ending, we were told the spoiler and everything like that, and I couldn't tell  it to you right now.  I couldn't tell you one of the spoilers that we heard, because I don't know the goofy names. 
[00:16:30]  I don't know the characters.  I don't care.  No.  I watched the movies.  Yeah?  The movies are actually pretty good.  I think I saw the first one.  The movies are all right.  So, yeah, we basically gave you guys the spoiler.  They're all getting too old now.  It's not as sexy.  The Harry Potter spoiler.  There's a bunch of spoilers, actually.  Yeah.  We threw it out there, what, on Friday?  Yeah.  And we asked the listeners out there, you know, when you see a news crew or your local  bookstore having a big adieu to do about the new book, to get in their faces and then  throw out some spoilers. 
[00:17:00]  Blurt it out and watch the fun ensue.  Where's Steve from foundrymusic.com?  Diligently working on something, I'm sure.  All right.  Well, we need to give this guy credit, first of all.  He, I think, I don't even know the, you know, the background of this.  I don't know if he was walking by the bookstore, driving back and forth, but basically he's  screaming out what was going on.  What's the deal with this bit?  I think it was a guy named Nick in Dallas who sent that to me on either Friday night  or Saturday morning, and he drove by a Barnes & Noble in Dallas at 1 o'clock in the morning, 
[00:17:30]  right when people were waiting to get the book.  1 in the morning.  I, boy, I just never understood that whole thing.  And you can hear from the audio, there's obviously kids waiting online, too.  So kids at 1 o'clock in the morning waiting to get the new Harry Potter book.  There have been things that I've wanted to buy, and you'll wait for it, and, you know,  anticipation.  But I have never stood out in front of a store until midnight to buy something.  Yeah, could...  Jesus.  Couldn't you just, like, wake up early and go there at 8?  Of course you could.  8, 9 in the morning? 
[00:18:00]  It's a big event for the kids.  They're probably all in their little jammies.  And what, they buy the book at 1, and then they go home and read a chapter before they  go to the book?  Read it.  Now go to bed.  I'll read it to you tomorrow.  Before they go to bed?  Right.  Read some now.  No, we'll read tomorrow.  They're just sitting on their nightstand.  Why are you touching me?  Their Harry Potter book is right next to their little bed.  They can't sleep.  With their Scooby-Doo sheets and pillowcases.  What year is this?  Scooby-Doo sheets.  Scooby-Doo is fucking huge again.  Is it?  Yes.  I ain't no clue. 
[00:18:30]  That was a great reference.  Really?  Yes.  Scooby-Doo is one of the biggest things going on right now with the kids.  Stop.  He's all I think of.  I'm telling you right now.  Parents, call me.  Scooby-Doo is hot right now.  I would think it was one of the newer cartoons.  Scooby-Doo, because the movie that came out, then all of a sudden I think they're even doing  new cartoons, right?  Yeah.  New Scooby-Doo cartoons.  SpongeBob.  SpongeBob?  Bob the Builder.  SpongeBob is so five minutes ago, as they like to say.  Really? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  It's still hot, but it's not as hot as Scooby-Doo.  Well, Bob the Builder.  Bob the Builder?  Yeah.  Kids like Bob the Builder?  No?  That's old news?  I think so.  I think so.  The big company.  What about Thomas the Train?  Thomas the Train?  No.  Is that the Ringo Starr thing?  I don't know what that is.  Yeah, it looks like that.  Little trains.  No, I didn't do a voice.  He did a voice in one of those kids' shows for a while, right?  That was Shining Time Station. 
[00:19:30]  George Carlin.  George Carlin did it, too.  Yeah, okay.  Whatever.  So, yeah, you know, everyone got their Harry Potter books.  Harry Potter sitting on the night table.  Yeah, and the parents got to tell them, now, now, tomorrow, because it's late now.  Go to sleep.  They have their wizard hat and their goofy Harry Potter glasses.  Because that's the way you have to read the book, kids.  You got to get the wacky Harry Potter glasses without the glasses.  Right, because that's dangerous for the kids.  Harry Potter glasses, a danger to your child? 
[00:20:00]  We'll let you know.  Say, Bill, Jersey.  It's all about Scooby-Doo, Anthony.  You got to be up on this stuff.  Bill and Jersey.  Why?  Go ahead, Bill.  Hey.  Morning, shit dicks.  Hello.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, oh, you're 100% right.  Scooby-Doo is bigger than ever.  My three-and-a-half-year-old is in love with him.  Really?  Yep.  Oh.  It's all the rage.  They just released all the old, when we were kids, those old Scooby-Doo shows and the 
[00:20:30]  Scooby-Doo hour movies with the Harlem Globetrotters, those are re-released on DVD.  My son's got them all.  He loves them.  As a matter of fact, he had the Scooby-Doo pillowcase last night on his pillow.  There you go.  Isn't that sweet?  Telling you, three-and-a-half years old.  Love Scooby.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  God, that is an old-ass cartoon, man.  Yeah, but because of the movie.  It's like 72.  Because of the movie, it came back strong, and they were redoing them and stuff.  The animation was the worst on those cartoons. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, the 70s was the downfall of good animation.  They had all that great Warner Brothers stuff that was really drawn very well, and then they  came out with that crap.  The whole Scooby-Doo and all the other cartoons that were around at that time, where they just  had like a single plate with the character on it and would just animate the mouth or the  eyes blinking or something.  Just horrible stuff.  You thought the Flintstones was good?  No, the Flintstones wasn't as bad as Scooby-Doo, but it was pretty bad.  The background, the same couch would go flying by when they were running through the... 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, when Fred was running through his house, it was the same background.  And how long was this house?  Because when they showed the outside shot, it didn't look like he lived in a big house.  Of course.  You'd go running by the same couch with the plant in the window, couch plant window.  Even as a 22-year-old, I could figure that one out.  Yeah, but the storylines were pretty funny.  Yeah.  And the characters were good.  Yeah, but their names sounded like rocks, and that was always wrong. 
[00:22:00]  You didn't like that?  No, that's not their real names.  Mr. Slate?  No, but I mean the celebrities that would come.  Oh, oh, I got you.  Right, right.  Like, who was that?  Stoney Curtis.  Stoney Curtis, and he was just like Tony Curtis, but only Stoney Curtis.  And Margrock.  Remember, she dropped in once.  Sure.  What about the Rock Hudson guy?  Well, that would just be Rock Hudson.  I think they called him fucking faggot. 
[00:22:30]  And a mouth with a belly full of pebbles.  I don't know what that means, but everyone got it.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York.  Mike?  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, yeah, no, my kid, last night I had to meet my kid fucking Scooby-Doo macaroni and cheese.  There you go, Anthony.  Scooby-Doo mac and cheese.  They even got the products and everything.  All right, Opie.  I pothed you.  He's fucking crazy for Scooby-Doo.  Yeah, it's nuts.  John in Texas.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Now, man, Scooby-Doo's gotten so big, they got these little Scooby snacks in the shape of dog biscuits for the kids. 
[00:23:00]  And my daughter loves them things.  I don't know what her problem is, but that's what she loves, and that's what she wanted.  Gee.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  Bye.  So there you go.  Do we have to take more Scooby calls?  I think you've been vindicated.  Ryan in Jersey.  What's up, Ryan?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  My wife was at Barnes & Noble in East Brunswick on Saturday morning, and there had to be about 150 people standing online buying this book. 
[00:23:30]  And I'm not sure if the guy mentioned you guys by name, but he said, hey, I heard on the radio who dies in the book.  And that entire mob, it just turned into a mob of people wanted to lynch him.  They were just vicious.  They wouldn't even let him get it out.  They started screaming, and parents are like little kids.  They're calling him an asshole.  And it was vicious.  Well, we got one that came in so far, and it's pretty funny.  At first, it's like whatever, and then it just gets really funny.  All right.  Thank you, Ryan.  All right.  Punch it out, boy.  So getting back to this, Anthony, the Scooby-Doo. 
[00:24:00]  Jesus, the Harry Potter spoiler.  So this guy in Dallas, he kind of worked the line as they're waiting for their Harry Potter books and started yelling out the spoiler, the big spoiler of the book.  I forgot this one.  Gary Grennett.  Remember him?  I'm Gary Grennett.  And Jimmy Darock.  That one's awful.  It must be Jimmy Darin.  Well, the TV stars, too.  Ed Sully Stone.  Jimmy O'Neil Stone. 
[00:24:30]  Rock Quarry was Rock Hudson, I think, right?  Rock Quarry was...  It wasn't really supposed to be based on any one actor.  It was just like a hammy actor.  I am Rock Quarry.  He was Rock Quarry, big Hollywood star.  Okay.  Holly rock star.  And he wanted to slow down a little.  He couldn't take it.  So he decided to go and make believe he was Gus Schultz, gas station attendant, just to get away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood.  I hated the Flintstones so much.  You did?  They make me physically ill. 
[00:25:00]  I loved them.  God, I hated them.  Loved the Flintstones.  And that Rock Quarry episode was my favorite.  He gets so upset that being Rock Quarry, then he goes to Bedrock, hooks up with the Flintstones.  They invite him in.  And then he gets bored because he's just bowling and shooting pool.  So he decides to tell the guys that he's really Holly Rock star Rock Quarry.  And they don't believe him.  Holly Rock star?  That's hilarious.  Yeah, he's in Holly Rock.  And he starts doing scenes from his movie, and they're laughing at him.  And the best part, he gets so pissed off at this that they don't believe him that he just hauls off and punches Fred right in the face. 
[00:25:30]  Like, because they're laughing at him.  He's like, you might remember me in Dr. Jekyll's Hyde.  And he turns around and just goes, ah!  And makes like he's a monster.  And shoot out at the OK Rock Quarry.  Pow, pow, pow!  And then they start laughing at him, and he just punches Fred right in the face.  Never a problem with violence back in the older days with cartoons.  Loved it. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  So getting back to the spoiler thing.  The guy in Dallas, he just worked the line, basically, while the parents were getting ready to buy their Harry Potter books for their children.  Harry Potter.  Listen closely, because he obviously recorded this on a cassette or something.  Oh, really?  I think he might have had a reel-to-reel or something.  Actually, the reel-to-reel would be better quality.  Better.  Snape kills Dumbledore!  Whoa! 
[00:26:30]  Snape kills Dumbledore!  Hey!  Snape kills Dumbledore!  No!  Bitch!  You bitch!  You bitch!  It sounds like he starts off, like, really aggressive, and then just is doing it individually.  Then just leans over to a little tyke. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  A little tyke.  Hey!  Snape kills Dumbledore!  What?  You gotta hear that again.  Snape kills Dumbledore!  Dumbledore!  Whoa!  Snape kills Dumbledore!  Hey!  Snape kills Dumbledore!  No! 
[00:27:30]  Bitch!  You bitch!  You bitch!  Oh, the disappointment in that kid's voice.  Yo!  Little kid goes ghetto, too.  Yo, bitch!  You bitch!  Language on that little guy.  On that little one.  That's funny.  Not bad.  Bravo to the dude in Dallas.  Bravo.  All right.  Oh, that disappointment.  It's wonderful. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Why is it so funny to hear kids just go, eh?  Whining with disappointment.  These are such coddled little creeps.  Oh!  Maybe we're just dicks.  Yeah.  All right, let's say hi to Gary in Kentucky.  Gary?  Yeah, I was going to let you guys know.  Hi, Gary!  Scooby-Doo is alive and well.  Boomerang, high def, big screen TV, drown sound all day long.  All Scooby-Doo, huh?  How do you know that, Opie?  How did you know that?  Is it young relatives that you see? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, nephews and nieces.  Oh, is that it?  Okay.  That's a problem, too, man.  You know, your kid gets into one movie, you've got to watch it a thousand times.  A thousand times.  It's a freaking nightmare.  Oh.  All right, Gary, thank you.  Thanks.  Punching out.  All right, punching out.  Yeah, let's say hi to Steve in Boston.  Steve.  What's up?  How about those Red Sox?  Awesome, isn't it?  What's awesome?  Yankees got three out of the four.  They won the World Series.  Who gives a shit? 
[00:29:00]  Oh, stop.  Look, it's a new year, my friend.  I know, I know.  Yankees, they're great, but still with the Sox.  We can't fight about this.  All right, all right.  Look, he's extending his hand in friendship.  Very good.  The olive branch of peace.  Go ahead, Steve.  Hey, what's up?  Actually, I was watching a Sox game on Friday night, and I actually saw Ben.  I got on a lot.  In one of the shots, they were talking to a Farrelly brother. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, I read a lot of instant feedbacks and posts on the message board.  Ben prominently displayed at the Sox game during one of the Farrelly brother interviews.  Why, was he sitting next to them?  Right behind him.  Right, yeah.  And someone's saying, all you see is Ben herking, jerking, and laughing at nothing behind him  as they're doing the interview.  He said it was the funniest goddamn thing he's ever seen.  Does anyone have video of this?  Well, I saw a few posts on the message board that said someone had a T-vote and was going  to put it on something and send it in. 
[00:30:00]  I've got to see it.  You have a T-vote?  I have a T-vote.  I'm fixing it right now.  I'm going to have it probably to you tonight.  All right, yeah.  You've got to email it to Steve, and we've got to see this, because I just hear he's  got like a beer in his hand.  He's herking and jerking and laughing.  Just being Ben.  That was great seats.  I had great seats.  You had really good seats, huh?  Hey, can I say one thing?  Yeah.  Stinky rules, bipolar speed rules.  Ooh.  All right, very good.  Hey.  Stinky rules.  Why didn't you do an assault on the media, Ben? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, we were doing assault on the media.  Okay.  You had a perfect opportunity right there.  So I don't carry WOW stickers around with me.  Yell out, ONA Party Rock.  Don't make me pull out the old newspaper article.  Oh, that one from the Mets game?  Yeah, you're being all cocky.  There's a picture of Ben and I.  It's got to be the worst picture ever taken for a newspaper.  That was at the Mets.  That was the year the Mets went to the World Series.  It was the clincher game of the World Series against the Yankees.  I mean, it wasn't against the Yankees.  It was...  Wasn't it?  They clinched.  No, dude.  That was the Mark McGuire game. 
[00:31:00]  The Cardinals.  Positive.  Wow, nice buzz.  I don't remember.  And the picture does show.  Nice buzz, by the way.  That's what I'm getting at.  We get great seats from one of our...  It was a listener, yeah.  Yeah, one of our faithful listeners hands us some great tickets to the Mets game.  And we're putting our beers on the dugout.  We're the first row above the dugout.  Boom, our beers are on the dugout.  And we're just heckling all the Cardinals as they go back to the dugout.  And I guess they took a picture, I'm not sure, of this one. 
[00:31:30]  McGuire going back to the dugout.  And right behind McGuire, you see Ben.  He has a beer in his hand.  He is hammered.  So snotted.  He's snotted.  He's got a wow sticker on a hat.  No.  Huh?  We also had the wow stickers on our beers.  Around the cups.  The beer cup.  See, we do the assaults on the media ourselves as well.  So Ben has like a wow sticker on his beer.  He has a wow sticker on his hat, a wow sticker on his shirt. 
[00:32:00]  And he's just in mid, like, just trying to drink the beer hammered.  Yeah, he's all tipping over sideways.  I'm next to Ben, like, looking at this hot dog.  And, like, my mouth is full and my eyes are half closed.  And the picture is hilarious.  I'll have to dig that up and throw it back up on the website.  We also made it that game.  We made it on this big screen.  Yeah.  We made it on the big screen of all of shit.  Because, actually, I remember, I think Jim Brewer was at the game, too.  And Jim Brewer saw us on the screen.  And then he called your cell phone.  Oh, that's right.  This was back years.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  That's right.  It was back a few years.  It was hilarious, this picture they took.  They obviously were taking a picture of McGuire.  But we're so obvious in the background.  Biggest day with our wow signs and looking just awful.  This one, though, is video.  Yeah, go ahead, Ben.  Video happened in Boston.  Well, no, what happened was is Peter Farley and his kids were sitting in front of me.  And we're talking during the game.  And what happened was we were in third baseline where several foul balls come over.  I mean, it's a really an area you've got to keep your eye open.  Pay attention, yeah.  Three guys over me got a foul ball off his chin.  His chin was bleeding. 
[00:33:00]  And there were so many balls.  So the ball was coming.  The ball was still in play.  And he went with his glove to grab it because his son was about six.  He was going to take his son's head off.  The ball was still in play.  So it was a ground rule double for the Yankees.  But then Dan Roach from Nesson came over to interview him.  And I was sitting behind him.  So it was funny.  You know.  It was funny?  It was funny.  It was funny.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I saw all kinds of posts on it on the message board.  And a couple of people then made some Photoshop that were pretty funny.  One was a Fenway, an aerial view, with a huge cock in one of the seats with ghost socks 
[00:33:30]  written on it.  At least I got to go to the game.  They won.  Jesus.  Ah, yeah.  They killed him.  I got to go to the game 17-0-1.  That was just a waste of time.  Al Leiter, picked up by the Yankees.  Yeah, I know.  It's good.  That is what you need.  It's always better.  I love the Yankees.  The mid-season replacement who's almost 58 years old.  That's a great move.  He's 39.  Oh, that's terrific for a pitcher.  That's what I like. 
[00:34:00]  And I hate you.  You know, Jeter, Rivera, Pettit.  What did they do for the team?  He did a great job.  What did he get?  Three hits and seven innings?  He pitched well.  Yeah, sort of hit Deky Araba when he first came.  And I'm sure Randy had some good games.  And Kevin Brown had some good games.  They're bums.  And I don't want them.  And I don't care about three out of four.  I could care less.  Al's a fun, nice guy, too.  You ever see interviews with him?  I'm sure he's terrific to hang out with and pull trains with.  But as far as pitching for the Yankees, I want someone who's 21 and not fun.  The Yankees have used something like 20, I think it's 23 pitchers this season?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want nothing to do with them. 
[00:34:30]  Three out of four.  I wish Ortiz could have come through.  Well, what's the name of the kid they brought up?  And he was part of that 17 blowout.  Yeah, I forget.  How about the center fielder there?  What's his name?  Milky or whatever?  That missed the fly ball.  And Troy Nixon got an inside the park home run in Fenway?  That was just an abortion of a game.  Bring up the young players.  That's what I want.  Yeah?  You want that guy in there?  I don't know him.  The guy was...  You've got to bring the young guys up, man.  You've got to bring the young guys up.  No, I agree with you there.  But you've got to bring good young guys up.  Okay, agreed. 
[00:35:00]  All right, let's say hi to John in Fort Lee, New Jersey.  What's up, John?  Good morning, boys.  I understand Ben is required to be at every Boston Red Sox home game.  They use his hog as a foul pole.  Is that true?  They use Ben's hog as a foul pole?  Except sometimes the ball goes fair and sometimes foul because of the jerking and the...  Jerking and jerking?  That's a fat foul pole.  That's hilarious.  And that's the call that made Ben leave the studio.  Ben was feeling good.  Like, okay, we're going to talk about something besides his hogs.  Huge hog. 
[00:35:30]  And now Ben's gone.  Todd the Trucker.  What's up, Todd?  Hey, morning, guys.  Morning, Todd.  National assault on the media.  I don't know if you guys caught it at the bush race Saturday.  Oh, yeah?  The guy got up behind the two announcers.  I was interviewing a stunt driver.  I guess he used to be a stunt driver turned bush racer.  I guess he did the stunts for the general leader at one time.  But the guy was standing up behind the announcer with a homemade sign that said,  O&A rules with the XM radio. 
[00:36:00]  Sticker, you couldn't miss this guy playing his day.  Wow, nice.  Jumping up and down.  I think the video's up on opianthony.com.  Let's check that out.  Yeah, I missed it.  I didn't get a chance.  I left like the last night.  I didn't get a chance until you get it.  All right.  Thank you, Todd.  All right.  Punch it out.  I don't know what he said at the end of his call, but I'm sure it was something nice.  While we punch that up, Instant Feedback, I just want to clear something up.  It says, hey, Opie, were you kissing Ben to get on the big screen?  No, it wasn't one of those moments, those awful things they do. 
[00:36:30]  That's usually an indoor hockey game thing, isn't it?  Yeah.  Where they show the couple inside the heart.  The kiss cam.  The kiss cam.  And they put the heart, and you're supposed to look, and you've got the people looking  into the monitor, and then, oh, we're on.  Did you pop the big question, Ben, will you be my producer?  That is the worst.  Yeah.  Sure.  Michael Kim, man.  I need time to think about this.  Such a big move.  Don't ask your broad to marry you at a sporting event.  No.  You'll look anywhere else for that matter. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  Here's the assault on the media, Anthony, that happened over the weekend.  These are happening on a weekly basis now.  Very good.  Opie and Anthony side in the background, an XM logo.  That's a good one.  That's a really good one.  And right behind the guys broadcasting, very good job.  Oh, being a perfect pass.  And then, look, they had to switch the shot.  Oh, and it's closer.  Yeah, but now the sign's closer.  What a pest.  Oh, that's a classic Opie and Anthony pest right there. 
[00:37:30]  Very, very good.  That's on...  That was part of the Speed Channel, I guess.  Is that on Foundry or where?  Jesus, at least 100 people must have saw that, huh?  Let's say hi to Tom in Virginia.  Tom?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Morning.  Hey, Tom.  Friday night on Speed Channel.  They're wrapping up all the driver interviews.  And there's a big poster in the background of Opie and Anthony.  No XM on there, though.  Yeah, I saw the XM.  It was in yellow, so it was very hard to see. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, it was great, though.  I was telling my girlfriend all about it.  She didn't understand what an assault on the media was.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You guys punch it out.  All right.  I don't think the one on the Speed Channel over the weekend is going to get the job done  for the best one of the month of July, right?  Yeah.  Have we decided which one's in the lead?  I still think...  Are they still voting, Steve, on the assault on the media?  I still like the guy.  The links are still up.  I don't know.  Well, we have to make a decision.  The wow sticker's over his boobs.  We have to decide who's in the lead, and then that's it. 
[00:38:30]  And that's what you have to beat for the month of July for the My Five.  July and a day in the studio with the program.  I like the guy with the wow sticker's over his boobs.  That was behind the cameraman.  He had balls.  Okay, yeah.  It's over, Paul.  It's over.  The new leader, as far as the assault on the media contest for the month of July, is Steve  in Salem, Massachusetts.  Anthony, he was the guy.  Showed up behind Dan Housley. 
[00:39:00]  We know this guy because he did a lot of reports on us when we got fired.  And Steve was just an annoying pest behind Dan.  Messed him up.  Yeah.  Steve was topless, showing off his man boobs.  His nips were covered with wow stickers.  And he made a complete fool of himself.  Yeah.  It was a perfect assault on the media.  Steve is officially in the lead for the assault on the media contest for July, okay?  Right.  And the winner for this month will win a MiFi and a day in the studio with the gang. 
[00:39:30]  Simple as that.  Is this a true story here?  What?  Man commits suicide after learning Harry Potter spoiler.  A rabid Harry Potter fan took his life yesterday after inadvertently learning a plot spoiler from  the soon-to-be-released Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince book.  Jude Ralston, 32, of Hudson, Ohio, left a suicide note indicating that since he overheard the plot spoiler  at a shopping mall earlier in the day, quote,  Jude, I no longer have a reason to live. 
[00:40:00]  Family and friends gathered for a candlelight memorial outside his home.  Wondered if they could have done anything to prevent this tragic fate.  When Jude got the vanity license plate that said Hogwarts, that seemed harmless enough.  Said Polly Clovis.  Went to school with him, I guess.  But when he started wearing the wizard hat around town, we really should have seen that as a cry for help.  No.  Is that, come on, is that true?  No, it's not.  Read the bottom. 
[00:40:30]  Okay.  Ah, okay, good.  You're right.  It's fake?  Yes.  Okay.  You scared me, Anthony.  Well, you never know, though.  That's why I said, is this real?  And I started, because I didn't read it.  No.  I just read the headline.  I'm sure Howard read this as a real story.  As he continues doing his fake, awful radio.  It sounded legit right up until wearing the wizard hat around town.  Only I do that.  Hey, can we play D&D as we go to break?  Speaking of wizard hats.  Ooh.  Before we do that, though, I got a really funny thing that I just, I just, this guy, 
[00:41:00]  just, I can't get enough of him.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  How Owen Wilson crashed out of school.  This guy just, it just, this guy's nuts.  Why do you hate Owen Wilson?  You are coming off as very petty.  Hate him?  Are you kidding?  And very jealous, Jimmy.  Jealous?  Why?  I'll never compete for parts with him.  I don't comb my hair forward.  He's terrific.  I don't, I don't.  Oh, this guy's a bad boy.  Don't get the obsession with that.  Dude, he's a bad boy.  Yeah.  How Owen crashed out of school.  Dude, before you go down that road. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, right.  You do realize that Owen likes to lick women's asses.  I completely, that's fantastic.  Where'd you hear that?  Where was that story?  We never got to it last week.  It was the story of the week and we never even touched on it.  Licks ass?  He likes to lick ass.  By the way, I saw the Team America uncut, uncensored thing over the weekend.  Holy shit, was I laughing my ass off.  That sex scene between the puppets, for how funny it was in the movie, it is so goddamn hysterical.  When his face is buried in the puppet's ass, and then he pisses on her face, and she shits on it. 
[00:42:00]  Are you serious?  Classic.  It is so goddamn funny.  I thought it was hysterical the first time I saw it.  When it was censored.  Can we just get that up on our website?  Oh, we gotta put it up there.  Just that?  Just that part.  Just this sex scene.  By the way, you just spoiled Team America for me.  Sorry.  Well.  That's a spoiler.  You know, it's not a need to hear.  It is funny enough.  No, I saw the original.  Even spoiled.  It is funny enough.  His face, his puppet face buried in her ass. 
[00:42:30]  She's on all fours.  He's on his knees behind her, just buried in puppet ass.  We fucked up, Jimmy, though.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  No, please.  You're the one.  Let the crowd die.  Wait for their laugh.  Here it comes.  Right.  All right.  Because this guy is incorrigible.  Wedding Crashers bad boy, Owen Wilson, was always that way.  It just goes on to say the high school he was thrown out of.  I got kicked out of St. Mark's High School for a bunch of Tom Sawyer pranks.  Cool.  Could you do it with the pursed lips? 
[00:43:00]  I'm sure that he did.  Of course, he had, of course, he had, you know, cook, Jim.  I was caught wearing white socks, which was against uniform rules, Wilson said.  I claimed I had athlete's foot.  And then he stole a geometry teacher's book, which had all the correct answers, and he gave  out the answers to classmates, so they got A's.  I tell you, this guy, what a bad boy.  I know one of the people are just involved with him. 
[00:43:30]  He's a maniac.  Oh, wow.  Well, when you grow up in that kind of environment, pulling gags like that, fame's right around  the corner.  Comedy is just a natural progression for you.  You've seen him as a funny guy.  When you're that good looking, you purse lips, and you comb your hair forward, you wind up  wearing white socks when you're not supposed to.  Is there, what is the problem with him and you?  No problem with him.  He's a good actor.  I'm actually, I agree with you, he is a good actor.  I like his stuff.  Oh, he's terrific.  He's, what's that, page six?  He's got a big picture of him with his locks just flowing in the wind. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  I got the story in front of me, Anthony.  All right.  Sexy face.  This started out as a blind item that we talk about from time to time in the Post.  Like, they say, which Hollywood actor, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  And they're basically talking about this Hollywood actor that just loves looking ass so much  that that's all he does.  Like, he brings girls back to his hotel, and they're expecting a night of romance and love.  Oh, wow.  And he just flips them over and just goes to town.  Get your ass up.  I mean, if that's part of the lovemaking, whatever, but he is all about the ass. 
[00:44:30]  Wow.  I bet he smells it, too.  I bet he likes to smell, too.  So, everyone was like...  Something in common.  See?  You share a common...  Sure do.  So, everyone was trying to figure out who's the dude, you know, that's into this, right?  And, well, the headline in the Post says,  Star Won't Scotch This Tale.  It takes more than a cheeky blind item in page six to aggravate Owen Wilson.  We recently ran a just-asking-about-a-blonde stud nicknamed the Butterscotch Stallion. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, no.  You're kidding me.  His nickname is the Butterscotch Stallion, who brought a woman back to his hotel room and proceeded to lick her buttocks for over two hours.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Butterscotch.  Oh.  You might go in for a little, uh, how do you do, but two hours.  Jesus.  Eh, just to let him know you're there.  Right.  Hey, look at this.  Look what I do now, but for two hours...  I'm there and I care. 
[00:45:30]  Well, that's why he's called the Butterscotch Stallion.  Proceeded to lick her buttocks for over two hours.  Is this in the Post?  Wow.  The Post has turned into a hustler.  Readers familiar with Wilson's Butterscotch Stallion moniker correctly guessed his identity, but the easy-going actor was hardly embarrassed.  It's like, who cares, Wilson told Rolling Stone when asked about the item.  I play it as it lays.  Certainly does.  Okay, so I may not be the greatest lover in the world.  Well, let's make that angle work. 
[00:46:00]  There's lots of different paths to the waterfall, he says.  Oof.  You don't have to be Don Juan over the mud trail.  Well, and wasn't it Gloria Steinem who said that women have to be responsible for their own orgasms?  Well, I take her at her word.  I'll do my best, okay, but at a certain point, you've got to, like, you know.  Hmm.  No, I don't.  I do respect that, actually.  Yeah.  So, Owen Wilson, the Butterscotch Stallion.  That's why his lips are always percy.  He's trying to smell his upper lip from yesterday. 
[00:46:30]  He's trying to remember that gal.  Yeah.  Two hours.  And then she ratted him out.  Is there that much going on back there for two hours?  Sitting around with her yapping gal pals.  And he ate my ass.  And, yeah, how was it?  You were with Owen Wilson.  Two.  Oh, yeah, how was it?  Hours.  A little weird.  He licked my ass for two hours.  Hello?  New York Post?  Stop the presses. 
[00:47:00]  Was he a good kisser?  I don't know.  That's a whole movie.  Yeah.  Butterscotch.  Yeah.  Yeesh.  I like that.  Yeesh.  Figures a rookie would just leave her there for two hours without helping her out, helping  her relieve herself.  The old reach around.  Yeah.  Let's go, Barney.  La, la, la, la.  I'm not listening to you anymore this morning.  Jesus Christ, are you fucking with me?  Problem?  Yeah.  I can't listen to the whole hour now on replay because of the Harry Potter shit. 
[00:47:30]  But you already know.  No, I don't.  Because every time you guys go to say something, I turn it down.  Snape kills Dumbledore.  Die, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Fuckers.  What an ass.  Yeah, why don't we hear this again as we go to break, Anthony?  Yes.  Some fine pest in Dallas just being an ass as everyone was getting their Harry Potter books  on Friday.  Listen to the poor little kid at the end.  Snape kills Dumbledore. 
[00:48:00]  Whoa!  Snape kills Dumbledore.  Hey!  Snape kills Dumbledore.  No!  Bitch!  You bitch!  Get a little harmonica.  Woo! 
[00:48:30]  I'm sorry.  I got my 12-sided die and I'm ready to roll with a wizard and my goblin crew.  My friends are coming over to my mom's basement bringing Funyuns in the Mountain Dew.  I got a big broad sword made out of cardboard and Mysterio's a pumpin' Zeppelin. 
[00:49:00]  It's that time of the night.  We turn on the black light.  Let the dungeons and the dragons begin.  It's D&D.  Fightin' with the legends of yore.  It's D&D.  Never kissed a lady before.  Nope.  Woo!  All right.  Take it home.  A little solo for it.  One more time.  Now the Lord of the Rings, the dark crystal and things. 
[00:49:30]  We use these as a reference tool.  And when we put on our cloaks and tell warlock jokes, we're the coolest kids at the school.  No, we're not.  I know.  Now Tack's a real bastard, but a fair dungeon master.  Mysterio's got hit points and charisma to lend.  And I rehearse in my room or what I call the dragon's tomb.  When I'm not out with my girlfriend, it's D&D.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got a girlfriend? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  It's D&D.  Warriors who terrify.  It's D&D.  Virgins to the day we...  One, two, three, four.  Dad!  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  All right.  Can we play some of the Bob Kelly audio?  Of course.  Is it Bob Kelly?  Oh, from your CD?  Yeah, from my CD.  Jesus, son of a bitch.  This is the audio that everybody has been waiting to hear.  Oh, here's the one.  Jim!  He's down.  You're way down.  He's down.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I snapped my knee, man.  Oh, no.  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, man.  Get it.  911, dude.  I broke my knee, man.  Hey!  I broke my fucking knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Hold on.  Can I look at it?  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, shit.  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke my fucking knee, dude. 
[00:51:30]  I heard it break, dude.  Oh, no.  I heard my knee break, dude.  You made it just pop it.  You're going to be okay.  I broke my knee, man.  I can't grab my knee.  Oh, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Hang on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Fuck.  Hang on.  Hang on.  God.  I broke my knee, dude.  Hang on.  Cut some ice.  Just leave this one flat.  Can you get it some water?  Hold my hand, man. 
[00:52:00]  Do you want some water?  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  Hold my hand, man.  Hold my hand?  This is not shit on my chest.  That would have had more dignity to it.  Grab a log on me, man.  Oh, my hand.  What happened, Bob, man?  I broke my knee, dude.  You're kidding.  Weird.  My leg.  How did this happen?  I was playing football.  Where?  On my knee. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, God, I love him.  Give my condolences to the faggot.  That was all this.  It's this one.  We got more audio, Anthony, of Bob Kelly playing football.  Oh, boy.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[00:53:00]  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best on you?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best on you?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best on you?  Congratulations to Tiger Woods. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  Winning another British Open.  Wasn't even close this week.  He's a good golfer, I should say.  Yeah.  He's a good golfer.  Golfer.  Yeah.  Ten majors.  Ten majors.  What's the record?  Eighteen.  Jack Nicklaus.  Eighteen.  Jack Nicklaus.  I loved him in that movie, The Shining.  He was great.  Like I said, I make that mistake all the fucking time. 
[00:54:00]  A golfer cook.  Anyway.  Man, a lot of people said that Tiger Woods was done.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, a couple of years back, it was looking like he was in a bad slump, and they're saying  his heyday over.  No.  No, he was just proving that he was a man.  Right.  He had that chick, and he was just banging her on an hourly basis.  That chick?  You mean the...  His wife, yeah.  The 11?  Yeah.  The Swedish model?  The Swedish model.  He hooked up with her. 
[00:54:30]  And he was sucking and fucking.  I heard he was the butterscotch golfer, they called him.  Just burying his face in her ass.  He didn't have time to practice.  No, that's what happened.  He had to get all that effing out of the way.  You're just effing every hour on the hour.  And it kind of cut into his game, and it was there for everyone to see.  You've got to remember to eat.  But now he's settled into a rhythm.  When you get into that new relationship, you've got to remember to eat. 
[00:55:00]  You don't need no stinking food.  Sometimes you've got to go, oh yeah, I've got to breathe.  Yeah.  You'll blow off your friends.  That's it.  You'll blow off the rest of your family.  You'll blow off your job when you get into a situation like that.  They're not making me feel good.  Huh?  They're not making me feel good.  Why would you go to work?  So he got a lot of that effing out of the way.  Now he's, I think he's settled down to just regular effing now.  Right.  He's down to the regular effing, and now he can start winning the majors again.  He's actually made it out to practice a few times. 
[00:55:30]  That's right.  And he's back.  That's right.  Now he's only doing it maybe three times a day instead of the seven that he was doing.  Yeah.  Imagine how hard it is to golf when you're just chafing down there, when you've just rubbed  skin away from it.  Yeah.  You've got to turn your hips.  Yeah.  And you feel like, oh.  Oh.  Ow.  The tip is stuck to your underwear because you're just leaking stuff.  That's the worst.  Yeah.  You've got to pull your underwear away.  Ow.  Ow.  Jesus. 
[00:56:00]  Ow.  Like that's happening to him every day, like multiple times a day.  Oh, that's great.  That is the worst.  You forget to shower in the morning, your bag stinks.  He's on the golf course.  He's on the golf course.  Yeah, he's with a smelly bag.  He tees up.  He goes to tee off, and he's just, oh.  This ball smells like garbage juice.  It stinks.  He's too busy having other golfers smell his fingers instead of actually playing.  She's calling her parents every 10 minutes, but he's rich.  I know. 
[00:56:30]  I know.  But he's rich.  But he's, I know.  I know.  He's half Asian.  He's not.  Yeah, play that angle.  You think she's played that angle with her folks?  Oh, many times.  That's hilarious.  Yes, 100%, of course.  Well, because she's got the pure blood in her.  Well, you know what?  Your kids are going to.  Oh, of course.  Conglomerated.  Malata.  Mongrel golfer. 
[00:57:00]  But that's all that was.  He had to settle down.  He got married and had to get a lot of that effing out of the way, so he wasn't practicing  as much, and now he's back.  Yeah.  He can get away from the house for a little while to practice.  That's all he needs, just a little.  That's all we're trying to say, if you think about it, really.  Hey, before we move on from the Harry Potter thing, which, by the way, did we mention 6.9  million copies sold in the first 24 hours?  Yeah, that's huge.  That's pretty good.  You're watching the record held by the previous Potter release. 
[00:57:30]  Books are stupid.  And like you said, a quarter million sales per hour.  7 million copies of...  That lady, she's got to be pulling in $80,000, $90,000 a year doing this.  I would say a bit more, Jim.  Perhaps more than that, even, gentlemen.  She's, I guess, one of the richest people in England, besides the royal family.  I think in the entire world at that point.  How much?  She's over a billion dollars.  Over a billion.  Over a billion dollars for just jotting down stupid names for things. 
[00:58:00]  And the sorcerer.  By the way, there was a whole conversation that went on.  Draco.  During the break.  Hogwarts.  Hogwarts.  That's what happens when Ben bangs a chick without a bag.  That's how they got Hogwarts.  That's Hogwarts.  Hogwarts.  Oh, is that amusing?  Yeah.  They're so big that they got little Red Sox hats on them. 
[00:58:30]  Charm bracelets.  I doubt.  Anyway, I want to bring up the discussion we had about Eric during the commercial break.  Yes.  What?  And his clothes.  That, oh, he could do nothing right in Jimmy's eyes.  I'm starting to side with Eric here.  Well, what was the comment you made?  Well, I like Eric.  It's not a, I just said, Eric, why are you dressed for your confirmation?  He's wearing a confirmation shirt today.  And so then Eric goes, is nothing good enough for you or something like that?  Yeah.  And then that's when I realized that Eric is now dressing to make you happy. 
[00:59:00]  Because you're the one.  He's making a conscious effort every morning.  Notice he's not wearing his tiny little baseball hat that barely fits his head.  But I don't, I'm not unhappy with his dress.  Yeah.  Like you wear just a t-shirt and it just has a regular shirt on.  But Eric would normally have these weird medium shirts with a t-shirt underneath that showcases  his gut and a baby hat.  How do I not comment on that?  A baby hat.  And then, you know, and the alternative, he comes in like he's doing a video for put on  the Ritz.  I mean, there's got to be a happy medium where you just put on a t-shirt. 
[00:59:30]  The jeans are fine.  Eric.  Let me see.  The sneakers are not bad.  They're like denim sneakers, which are really, you know, cool if you're, you know, maybe  in a Wham video.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with those.  Eric.  Yeah.  I want you to be honest.  Are you now dressing for, for him?  Today I did.  Yes.  Yeah.  You looked at something and probably said no.  And you said, you know what?  I don't want them commenting about my clothes, so I think if I wear this shirt, good old  Jimmy will say nothing, right?  That is exactly why I wore this shirt. 
[01:00:00]  Well, you shouldn't have given it away with it, but I still have pins in the back of it.  A brand new.  Pins.  Crispy shirt.  Cardboard in the collar.  It's all stiff.  Itches because you haven't washed it yet.  Yeah.  Or worsted it, as I say.  Worsh.  It's not a bad shirt, actually.  It's just weird to see in the morning.  All right.  Let's say hi to Josh in Oklahoma City.  Josh.  Good morning.  Morning.  Ben's hog is so big, he uses the equator as a cock ring.  Is that another Drew Carey joke?  Oh. 
[01:00:30]  Where's the Drew Carey audio?  They're all the Ben's hog jokes.  Who stole those?  All the listeners?  All the listeners.  Yeah, the listeners kind of jumped on board.  You bastard.  This is where they're getting all the Ben's hog is so big jokes.  I dig it so big, there's still snow on it in the summertime.  We heard that one?  I dig it so big, I went to the Viper room.  My dick I ride in.  I had to stand there and argue with the doorman.  I dig it so big, I have to call it Mr. Dick in front of company.  My dick is so big, it won't return Spielberg's calls. 
[01:01:00]  Ah, there's another one.  My dick is so big, it graduated a year ahead of me from high school.  My dick has an elevator and a lobby.  Yep, that one.  Yeah.  My dick has better credit than I do.  My dick is so big, clowns climb out of it when I come.  Where is this audio from?  Yeah, what is that?  That's actually Drew Carey's voice, like doing a reading.  Yeah, sleepwalking.  This stinks.  My dick is so big, it was once overthrown by a military coup.  It's now known as the Democratic Republic of my dick. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  My dick is so big, it has casters.  My dick is so big, I'm already fucking a girl tomorrow.  My dick is so big, ships use it to find their way into the harbor.  My dick is so big, there was a movie called Godzilla vs. My Dick.  My dick is so big, it lives next door.  My dick is so big, I entered it in the Big Dick contest.  It came in first, second, and third.  My dick is so big, it folks.  My dick is a better dresser than I am.  Okay, terrific. 
[01:02:00]  My dick is so big, it has a three-picture deal.  I heard that one.  My dick is so big, that the head of it's only seen my balls in pictures.  My dick is so big, Henry Aaron used it to hit a 750th home run.  Heard that one.  It's like the delivery...  My dick runs the 440 in 15 seconds.  It's like that somber delivery with the clear voice that you'd read like the AIDS dead,  you know, at the quilt dedication or something.  Something important.  This is like the reading of the Titanic names.  Yeah, something like that.  Reading of the names of the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, my God.  But it's dick jokes.  Where's this from?  I want to know what this is.  What?  In context, what this is.  Maybe he wrote them down.  Oh, book on tape.  It's his book, and then him reading his book for books on tape.  But isn't he supposed to be a funny guy?  He's funny, yeah.  Maybe he's just reading these books.  No, isn't he supposed to be a funny guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ugh.  You don't like Drew Carey?  No.  You don't like Owen Wilson?  I don't like Drew Carey.  I don't hate him.  I don't know him.  Drew Carey's good.  I like Drew Carey. 
[01:03:00]  His delivery is awful.  Well, in this, I think he's just reading.  My dick is the walrus.  Cuckoo kajoo.  No matter where I go, my dick always gets there first.  My dick takes longer lunches than I do.  Yeah, this is really a weird situation.  It's like something he's probably done on stage, maybe, but the delivery is him reading  because it's books on tape.  He's not doing his act.  And in a book, it probably looks good when you read a list of things like this.  Boom, boom, boom.  Right.  Book form, it's probably fine. 
[01:03:30]  But if you're a comedian, I mean, he's got to know this is boring as shit.  But it's the book on tape, not a recording of his live act or something.  Yeah, but why can't he just give it a slight oomph?  That's just it.  What do you do?  Do you do that or do you just read it because it's a book on tape?  Because instead, you get this.  My dick contributed $50,000 to the Democratic National Committee.  My dick was once ambassador to China.  My dick is so big it's gone condo.  My dick hit .370 in the minors before it hurt its knee.  My dick was almost drafted by the Cleveland Browns, 
[01:04:00]  but Art Mordell didn't want a bigger dick than he was on the team.  There are funny lines, but the delivery is awful.  Yeah, that is weird.  It's a weird thing.  He probably toiled over that decision.  What do I do?  Do I read it with inflection or it's a book on tape?  I'm just supposed to read.  You're not supposed to distract.  You're supposed to just read it.  My dick is so big I use the Eiffel Tower as a French tickler.  It's so big when it rains, the head of my dick doesn't get wet.  My dick is so big I could wear it as a tie if I wasn't so afraid of getting a hard on and killing myself. 
[01:04:30]  My dick is so big I have to use an elastic zipper.  My dick is so big it has feet.  My dick is so big a homeless family lives underneath it.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  But that's where the listeners got the Ben's hog.  Ben's hog jokes.  Jokes.  Lifted them.  Before I move on from the Harry Potter thing, this is definitely worth checking out.  Katie Couric interviewed J.K. 
[01:05:00]  How did you say her last name?  Rowling?  Rowling.  J.K. Rowling.  I don't know.  The author of the Harry Potter books.  Harry Potter?  It was the exclusive interview, Anthony.  Exclusive?  Yeah, the only person in the United States to talk to J.K. Rowling.  How about that?  And it was Katie Couric, of all people.  Because, you know, she does such a great interview.  They're usually wonderful.  Usually learn a lot about the person. 
[01:05:30]  Yes.  That literary juggernaut known as Harry Potter continued to cast its spell on wizard wannabes  all weekend, as copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince flew off the shelves faster  than a golden snitch.  I get it.  Oh, boy.  See, what she's doing is she's... 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Wow, that's a...  I needed a good laugh.  That's good stuff.  Come on, right?  Well, is that what this is about?  She's using terms from the book during her interview?  Oh, fuck.  Ugh.  Too bad one of the terms isn't middle-aged house-frau who dresses like a sailor.  Semi-colon twat.  You know, they talk about how she was dressed over the weekend in the paper today.  Give me the post there, Eric.  Really?  They're commenting on her clothes now?  They're awful clothes.  I was saying that she wore a tiny little, like, uh, jean shorts and was showing too much 
[01:06:30]  leg.  Oh.  Hot.  Very hot.  Oh, Queen Latifah, man.  I can't wait to see her next film.  That's gonna be funny.  Sure.  She's probably gonna play the sassy black woman.  White man don't know what he's doing.  Yeah, he's too busy banking, going to college.  I like the trailers.  I like the trailers where it's like, I'm gonna put my foot up, y'all. 
[01:07:00]  They put a sound effect in.  I wonder what she said.  I'll put my foot up, y'all.  Yeah.  Catch Queen Latifah.  Why don't you go, y'all.  Hey, can you hold the whistle?  Yeah.  Because I have to do one.  I'm just a stupid...  We did bring it down the house. 
[01:07:30]  Steve Martin's a real...  ...lover.  That's classic.  All right, here we go.  Katie Couric.  Oh, right, Katie Couric.  Katie Couric at the Mainland Restaurant at 64th and 3rd, sitting in low-rise jeans...  Oh, it was jeans, okay.  Sitting in low-rise jeans and showing a lot of skin and a metallic silver long. 
[01:08:00]  That's nice.  I can't...  She's doing the look that...  I, all of a sudden, was making the butthead face.  I'm just sitting here shocked.  Ugh.  Ugh.  She's doing the look that the young girls like to do.  The low-rise jeans, and then you get to see a little bit of thong.  Not on Katie.  We don't want to see that on Katie Couric.  There you go.  Oh.  There you go.  How old abroad is she? 
[01:08:30]  She's got to be at least...  I don't know.  I mean, look.  She's not a mess.  I'm not saying that.  Was she 48, 49?  But there's an age where you don't wear that anymore.  Yeah, 14.  There's nothing worse than driving down the road, and you see some chick from the back with  like long blonde hair, kind of got a good figure, good shape from the back, and you drive up,  and you take that look, and it's like a 60-year-old grandmother with the rouge all over her cheeks 
[01:09:00]  and big red lipstick, and eye makeup on.  It's like a horror movie.  You actually go, oh!  Woo!  Taken aback.  You realize she's wearing a wig?  It's not even her hair?  Yeah, big wig.  What happens with the women, though?  Like the younger women, they know how to put on the makeup perfectly.  Yeah.  And something happens with age, and all of a sudden you're right.  It's just a big smear red mess.  Where you live, it's the worst I've ever seen anywhere.  Yeah.  You walk the sidewalks up by where you live, and there's these old women with that makeup 
[01:09:30]  on, and their face pulled back by, I guess, surgery, but maybe they have problems with  the loose skin.  They're trying to make up a bulldog or something.  You've got like a lot of flaps and folds going on.  It's not tight like a drum, but it's easier to put paint on a drum.  There's a big red smear that's not blended in at all.  Yeah, it's not blended.  Because how do you blend in red with like white, with transparent skin?  They start lip-sticking outside the line. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  And then it wicks up the cracks.  Jesus.  We all colored when we were kids.  How hard could it be?  You silly goose.  Stay in the line.  Because all people, their lips disappear or something.  You can have nice full lips in your youth, and then you get older, and their lips disappear.  So they put lipstick on, and they make it bigger than their lips.  And then because it's their skin now, and they've got wrinkles above their lip, the red  lipstick kind of wicks up that crevice, and now they've got like spider web things of 
[01:10:30]  lipstick going up to their nose.  Probably because they put it on when their teeth are still in a jar, and so there's not  a good lip thing.  And then they put it in, and the teeth kind of blow the skin out.  That's the other thing, too.  All of a sudden, there's lipstick on their teeth.  On the teeth.  You don't see that with the young ladies out there.  And lipstick on the Chesterfield cigarettes.  It's just that heavy lipstick.  If you get a cup of coffee in a diner, and there's lipstick on the cup.  So disgusting.  It's awful.  You ever find a condom and there's lipstick on it? 
[01:11:00]  We've talked about that.  When I used to have to commute on the train in, I would take the same train as all the  old ladies coming in for the matinee, so they all get together, and they're doing  their makeup on the train and stuff, and wow.  And their voices are deeper than mine.  Like, what happens?  They cut all their hair off.  Because you know they probably were hot in their day, and something happens, and you  wake up, and you realize you married Bob.  They just give up.  Yeah, their hair is short. 
[01:11:30]  Manly features.  Their voice is deeper.  They're trying to throw the makeup on themselves to look like they're female, but...  Yeah.  It's awful.  Just end up looking like men.  For some reason, old women decide they can't have long hair.  And I don't mean like, you know, have that long witch hair where it's, you know, pure  shocking white and down to their ass.  It's funny.  But, you know, as a happy medium, you don't need the crew cut, you know, a marine cut. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, your hubby loves that.  Looking over and just seeing a hair that's shorter than his.  Yeah, if your wife comes home with a short haircut and goes, I love it, it's so much  easier to take care of.  Yeah.  You are so done.  You're done.  It's so easy to take care of.  She just gave up.  She gave up on you.  Right.  Congratulations.  You just married your friend Bob.  Yeah.  That's it.  Oh, she started out as Jane 20 years ago, but now...  Not anymore.  Might as well start calling her Bob.  Or if you say something funny to your wife and she goes, what's that?  Some kind of sick joke? 
[01:12:30]  All I've ever asked of my marines, they obey my orders as they would the word of God.  If we please get that sound clip.  That's my favorite moment ever.  We need a lot of sound clips.  We've got to freshen up the instant replays.  Ooh, freshen it up.  Okay, so Katie Couric, why don't we go back to the first clip, because now we went off on  a 20 minute tangent, Anthony.  Happy birthday to me.  Oh, Jimmy's birthday today.  Fuck. 
[01:13:00]  No, it's not.  Look at him.  No, it's not.  Damn it.  I knew there was something we'd forget.  How old a guy are you today?  Let me see.  My birthday's up until tomorrow.  Yeah.  I was just even thinking.  What's the date?  19.  Wait, I'm not sure if it's the 18th or 19th.  Oh.  Jimmy's birthday tomorrow.  I'm not even going to fake it.  I don't know.  What are we going to do for your birthday?  Nothing, guys.  No reason to mention it.  Is it tomorrow?  Oh, who thinks about that?  Is it today or tomorrow?  It's tomorrow, but who thinks about it?  Okay.  You want girls to line up and just take dumps on you all day tomorrow?  Ooh.  We've got to do something for your birthday tomorrow.  What are you scotch comic?  I'm going to Ozfest right after in Philly. 
[01:13:30]  You are?  Yes, tomorrow?  Yeah.  Very good.  Jimmy's birthday tomorrow.  Here's what I want for my birthday.  I want Ben to wear saran-wrapped slacks with no underpants.  Finally get that mystery out of the way.  Hey, I sent the guy for coffee an hour ago.  Where did he go?  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute, dude.  Why didn't you ask me for coffee?  Because it was while I was outside going for coffee.  I remembered your birthday.  You didn't.  I had to sing quietly.  I actually faked it.  I'm like, oh, wait.  Of course you did.  Which one did you sing? 
[01:14:00]  I'm a better actor than who, who, who, though.  Harry.  An hour ago.  An hour ago.  Harry.  It wasn't an hour ago.  How long was the last break?  How long ago was that?  Half hour ago.  20 minutes ago?  No, about 20 minutes ago.  Hey, I need coffee, too.  Coffee diva.  Can I get coffee?  Fucking fast.  I want one of those apple things I got last night.  Apple diva.  Remember when they shoved that?  Apple diva.  They shoved some kind of apple crumb cake-looking thing in a bag?  Why is Harry still here?  Harry, what are you doing here?  Weren't you supposed to get coffee for Jimmy? 
[01:14:30]  No one told me to get coffee.  Oh, boy.  I didn't send you specifically.  I put the thing up for coffee.  I told one of those guys.  Oh, boy.  No one told me.  Sorry.  Lapse in communication.  Well, that means I get coffee now, too.  Right.  Can I get an ice, bro?  You know how I like it.  I want the apple thing.  What is it called, Jimmy?  The apple cake.  Low-fat apple cake.  Low-fat apple cake.  For me.  Make sure they don't just throw it in the paper bag this time.  What the hell was that?  I gave you 20 before.  Who did I give 20 to?  That's me.  I still have the chance.  You don't need to give it back.  Just... 
[01:15:00]  You don't need to give a change of a 20 for a cup of coffee.  Harry, are you happy that Ron and Fez are coming to 202?  Are they officially coming?  I didn't...  What?  I didn't hear the news.  But if they are, I'm very excited.  You used to work with those guys, right?  Yeah.  They were great.  Yeah, they are.  A lot of fun.  Why do you think Harry's been posting something he shouldn't?  I'm just asking him.  Okay.  You know it's illegal to post on message boards if you're an intern here.  I don't post anything on my bag or any website.  Any of the interns post?  You hear?  What's the word on the street? 
[01:15:30]  Not that I know of.  Go ahead, Ben.  Ron and Fez Diva.  What?  Post Diva.  Post Diva.  Jesus, Ben.  Os Fest Diva.  All right.  Yeah, I need a grande ice, please.  Yeah, I'd like a medium ice latte with fat-free milk.  And I'd also like a piece of low-fat cake.  Blueberry preferred.  It doesn't have to be blueberry.  It can be some other sort of low-fat cake, please.  Apple for me, sir.  Low-fat apple cake.  But it's not right.  And if there's no apple, blueberry will not suffice.  Excuse me, but they're not really low-fat. 
[01:16:00]  They say it, but they're still, you know...  You know what, Bob?  They're still going to make you chubby.  I want low...  I'm eating a little bit of carbs today because I have a long day ahead of me, and I want  a little bit of that...  You need the energy, Jimmy.  I've been going to that little gym, just working out and checking out some figures.  Ooh.  Why don't you go on, like, the South Beach diet?  Nah, it's no way.  Then you put it all back on.  I'm just going down slow.  Question?  Question?  If they do not have apple, what would suffice?  Finding a place that has apple for the most.  Low-fat blueberry muffin.  No.  I hate blueberry.  It's awful.  Clean job.  I hate blueberries. 
[01:16:30]  Don't like them.  No?  Don't like them.  No.  Anything but blueberry?  Nothing.  Nothing with goddamn peanut butter.  Peanut butter?  I just had to bring that up because I hate it so much.  Starbucks isn't a fan of peanut butter.  I've never seen peanut butter stuff there.  Oh, I have.  There was a peanut butter thing.  It was so rich.  It was sinful.  That's what me and my friends would always say.  Just put it this way.  By the way, we...  There better be apple.  We talk about Starbucks every day.  Why can't we get a Starbucks machine like they have in Washington?  Because...  I've been asking for this for three months.  Four months, maybe.  Because that's probably mixed in with the TV commercial somewhere. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  On the billboard.  All right.  Marketing.  Yeah.  All right.  Where were we?  Katie Couric.  Yeah.  J.K. Rowling interview.  By the way, the South Beach diet thing was a setup for a pretty good joke.  And now...  What?  Oops.  What was it to me?  What was the...  Oh, boy.  Someone interrupted.  Now you got to do it.  I was going on a...  No, because now I know it's going to bomb.  But no one knew you were doing it.  No.  See, that's not fair of you.  This is not fair of you.  I was frustrated, though.  Then you shouldn't have brought it up.  I was frustrated because I really thought I had a good line. 
[01:17:30]  I set you up with, why don't you go on the South Beach diet?  And he said...  What did you say?  Nah, because then you put it right back on.  Like, that's why.  And then you had to, like, talk about apple stuff.  Oh, he had a question.  And peanut butter stuff.  And blueberry stuff.  Oh, so Harry wrecked my line?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Harry was, like, on the mic like this.  Like...  And just on purpose.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm prepared to bomb.  I'm not even going to play this game.  No, no.  Don't.  Don't prepare.  So I was going to go, Jimmy's not on the South Beach diet.  He's on the South Bronx diet. 
[01:18:00]  Hookers and losing weight.  Yeah.  But you can see where it could have been cute in the right context.  I think you'd have gotten blank stares.  That was a little vague.  A little...  If you could have brought it around a little more.  Well, I was trying to think of a... 
[01:18:30]  A few more details.  A very popular hook application.  Yeah.  I got one.  Jimmy's on the South Orange diet.  All right.  But you can't do better than the South Bronx if you're going to try that joke, right?  Maybe I'll eat Mexican food.  Go on the South of the Border diet.  Oh!  It's a South Beach diet.  Or maybe I'll only eat black people and go on the South diet. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  Katie Couric and J.K. Rowling interview.  This was an exclusive.  And now they're running it on the Today Show.  It's such a big interview.  It's a huge interview for the fine folks at the Today Show.  So...  All right.  Here we go.  So let's start with the first one again.  I guess we're doing this because Katie has to, like, get some of the terminology from the book.  Is that it right there?  Yeah.  Oh.  We're taping it.  That literary juggernaut known as Harry Potter continued to cast its spell on wizard wannabes all weekend as copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince blew off the shelves faster than a golden snitch. 
[01:19:30]  Oh!  How many references?  That's what we're getting at.  These are all the references.  Blew off the shelves.  Eric did a good job with this.  Eric did a good job with this.  Eric did a good job with this.  And Nathaniel?  A lot of...  Mangro wizard!  So, uh, faster than a golden snitch.  Now, I...  The wizard is a...  I saw the Harry Potter movies, and the golden snitch, it's pretty fast. 
[01:20:00]  Oof.  I couldn't tell you.  See if I take a rolling!  Call it Hogwarts heaven for those chosen few aficionados, most of whom had won contests, hunting for Harry's most bewitched.  Fans.  Harry Potter rocks!  So, needless to say, I felt privileged.  J.K. Rowling granted her only Half-Blood Prince television interview to a muggle like me. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, my God.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  See, she's getting into the spirit of the Harry Potter thing.  She's a muggle, Anthony.  She's getting into character.  What the fuck is a muggle?  Um...  A muggle like me.  Can you hit that warning we used to have?  I know, I know that.  Can you explain where a muggle is?  All right, hold on a minute.  I had that rolling around in my head.  I haven't used that in so long, I don't even know where it is.  Oh, you better find it.  You better find it, because I'm really, uh... 
[01:21:00]  De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-dum.  Muggle, muggle, muggle.  Uh, where is it?  Oh.  Uh.  Raging bull.  Wow, your mud has muggled in.  Oh, you moved it way down there.  Okay.  Warning, warning.  Seaward alert.  Seaward alert.  Warning, warning.  A muggle is a curmudgeon.  Easy with the language. 
[01:21:30]  Let's go to Dugout Doug from whackbag.com.  Let me just start off by saying that Jester has me in his sights.  Finger on the button.  Maybe Jimmy can eat munchkins and go on the Good Witch of the South diet.  Oh, wow, you...  Wow.  I'm off the hook.  Wow.  Wow, thank you.  Oh.  Thank you, Dugout Doug, for getting me off the hook.  Crash.  All right.  Wow.  I wouldn't even dignify that with a crash.  All right, here we go.  Some more, um...  That's a...  More Katie Couric references to the Harry Potter books in her exclusive interview with J.K. Rowling. 
[01:22:00]  I've worked very hard on it, but if 15 years ago, if someone had said, you know, yeah, you'll publish it, it will be popular.  There will be guns involved.  It's really, it's just, it's surreal, isn't it?  Meanwhile, Rowling's money keeps, well, rolling in.  Rolling in, get it?  Everything's got to be a little quip.  Who writes this shit? 
[01:22:30]  Dribble.  And the way she delivers it, and Rowling's money keeps, well, rolling in.  Rolling in.  Hold on to your hats.  Hold on to your wizard hats.  Let's say hi to...  Hold on to your slips.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jim.  Jim?  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing, guys?  Hi.  A muggle is a mongrel class of wizard.  It's basically a...  Don't try to cover up your bomb by explaining. 
[01:23:00]  Well, you know, what do you want?  He did.  He tried.  He almost threw his ass for the muggle.  I'm driving.  What do you want from me?  Yeah.  You can't be funny and drive at the same time.  You silly.  Goose?  Not in Atlanta, that's for sure.  Hotlanta!  Yeah.  You're going to drive through Freaknik and you just yell muggle out the window and see  how many people chase your car.  Freaknik.  Fine timing.  Punch it out, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Let's get back to the exclusive interview here.  And as she looks forward to a literary life beyond Harry Potter, Joe says she'll savor 
[01:23:30]  her final journey aboard the Hogwarts Express.  I got to tell you, I really hope Katie Couric is getting on a train and she gets pressed between  the train and platform and her stomach and heart leak out her asshole.  Man.  You know they trap people but they're still alive?  Yeah.  Because they're compressed.  You know how hard it must be to breathe?  Yeah.  Like you know you're compressed?  Probably be pretty rough. 
[01:24:00]  They've shown that on some of those shows where you're alive until they have to move  the train and say, well, guess what, dude?  It's like, well, you're done for.  All right.  Say goodbye to your wife and your kids.  Anything else you want us to do?  Because we have to move this train along because people are waiting to get home.  People got to get to work.  I'm just concerned about looking at you.  Dude, what are you doing down there?  You're holding up the train.  Because you're right.  Like your whole bottom half is gone and you're just going to bleed to death, but it's all...  That was in Signs, too.  Was it in Signs?  Remember that?  His wife got pinned against the tree.  The guy driving pinned her against the tree and he got there and talked to her. 
[01:24:30]  And she said all that wacky stuff.  Remember?  Did she die?  Remember Signs?  Of course she did.  She was pinned against the tree.  But why do you have to remove the...  Why do you have to move the car?  Just leave it there?  Just build a house around her.  Right.  Why didn't you kill her?  Drill a hole through the back of the tree so you can bang her?  Why are we so pompous as a society?  Why can't we let that person live?  Just leave them there.  Just leave the car, the tree, and the person in between the two?  I think there could be a problem.  I think they could still have a productive life. 
[01:25:00]  Maybe get into some kind of a computer work.  Right.  So you can just set up a keyboard on the hood.  And who decides that it's time to remove the car from that situation and then the person dies?  Just leave them there until...  Yeah, build a structure around them so they don't get wet when it rains.  I don't think you're looking at the big picture here.  Why?  Well, I believe they would probably pass on quite quickly.  What do you mean? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, Jimmy made it perfectly clear.  What do you mean those organs?  Everything is still intact.  Yeah.  No, everything is smashed.  Everything, your intestines would probably be gone.  I saw it on TV with the whole train thing, too.  You stay alive until they remove the train.  And then everything just flushes out of you.  Right.  It comes out of all the holes that are in you.  So why can't we just build another subway line and let that person live?  Because people have got to get to work. 
[01:26:00]  All you do is just put, you cut them out, but you leave enough pressure on the back.  And then you just cut out a piece of the platform and you send them home.  Like, you just tie, like you cut a piece of the platform and you kind of tie it with a belt or some type of rope around them.  To keep it tight.  So they always have belt, they have train back and platform around them at all times.  And mangled root legs.  Bloody root legs.  Stay off of the way.  Maybe we'll be doing that in the future. 
[01:26:30]  Let's say hi to Ed in Jersey.  Ed?  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning, Ed.  Good morning, Chicken Lips.  Hello, awful name.  Yeah, I know.  Did you guys wish to know what a muggle really is?  Yeah.  A muggle in the book is people who are non-magical people.  So the wizarding community refers to regular people as muggles.  Oh.  You see, I'm a fag and I read all the books.  Ugh, you certainly are.  Yes, well, I'm not really a fag.  Which means it's perfectly fine to stereotype.  There's nothing wrong with it. 
[01:27:00]  I hear you.  If we're going to stereotype, we might as well stereotype.  I think so.  I think you're correct.  But I didn't actually go out and buy the Harry Potter broomstick that vibrated.  I missed out on that one.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, guys.  Bye.  A couple of pissed off people.  Why?  This spoiler for Harry Potter.  Eh, stop it, you faggots.  But I got to tell you, people ruined it for me.  They ruined the World Series of Poker. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  You know what should be the spoiler for Harry Potter?  The first time you fuck a girl.  Ooh.  Wow.  That's a spoiler.  All of a sudden, no interest.  Wow.  Who cares what a muggle is?  All right, we have one more.  A muggle is now what you leave on her back when you're finished.  Give me a towel.  There's a muggle in my hair.  And you can see more of my exclusive interview with J.K. Rowling, including more questions from you muggles at home, tomorrow on Today.  She said it again. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, boy.  This is what passes for entertainment for everybody.  Yeah.  Thank you, Katie.  Oh, she's just awful.  Thank God you're out there to entertain us.  Muggle, do the same line again.  Muggles like me.  The money keeps swell.  Rolling in.  Rolling.  Get it?  Name?  All right, you guys know the insects song?  Yeah.  Better watch out or the insects will get you.  Uh-huh.  Good old Pepe.  He's good for a tune every once in a while for the program.  Mm-hmm.  He did a swinging remix of the insects song. 
[01:28:30]  Hoo-hoo.  Is this a rip-off, though?  Why?  Richard Cheese.  Oh, it sounds a lot like Richard Cheese.  It sounds like Richard Cheese.  Tell them, Fred.  Richard Cheese is definitely going to be pissed off.  I would be.  How's the Richard Cheese feel to it?  The guy's kind of lifting his act.  Well, you heard Richard Cheese and the boys do their version of shit dick.  So, Pappy said, you know what?  I'm going to do my version of insects.  All right.  Dedicate this one to all the pests out there. 
[01:29:00]  Better watch out or the insects will get you.  I said, you better watch out or the insects will get you.  Listen up.  If you accidentally fall in the water, you're in trouble.  Spires will come after you. 
[01:29:30]  You.  You better watch out or the insects will get you.  Look out now.  You better watch out or the insects will get you.  Run for cover, all you trainables.  Flies will try to steal your food.  Pappy don't like them.  They're disgusting.  Get the bugs spray fast because they're in the room.  Room.  Room. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, you better watch out or the insects will get you.  I say, you better watch out or the insects will get you.  Timmy.  Better watch out or the insects will get you.  Anthony sleeps in a plastic bubble because he heard.  You better watch out or the insects will get you.  Well, some of that oxy powder will kill the bugs when it bugs you. 
[01:30:30]  Better watch out or the insects will get you.  Wow.  Not bad.  The most amazing part, he was able to understand the words that that retard was singing during  that song to write him down.  Yeah.  I never knew those were the words.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jack in Boston.  Jack.  Hey, I got a term from Harry Potter I think Norton would get kicked out of.  All right.  The slang for a half wizard, half muggle is a mudblood. 
[01:31:00]  Mudblood.  When you get tired of yelling about mongrels, you can throw in mudblood instead.  Maybe we should have some Harry Potter terms for the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, I'd love that.  That could be the bit today.  Maybe working off the word muggle.  Or a few other words.  Or a few other words like...  Hogwart.  Hogwart.  You already have that.  Hogwart. 
[01:31:30]  I don't know.  We'll throw it out there and see if maybe something can develop there.  All right.  This Richard Cheese ripoff has an originality index of zero.  Wow.  He's getting bashed because of the ripoff thing.  He's at richardc at yahoo.com.  From Los Angeles, California.  Thanks, baby girl.  All right.  Why don't we ask them?  Did they have apple?  Yes, they did.  Do they like wrap it up or did they just throw it in the paper bag again?  There's like a little piece of like...  Did you poke your fingers in the bag?  I'm not...  I'm not...  What are you doing? 
[01:32:00]  I'm holding the outside of the bag.  No.  No, your fingers were inside the bag.  Your fingers were in that bag?  Your fingers were in the bag.  I may...  Don't you know how to touch the apple?  Don't touch it anymore.  I didn't touch...  Don't you know how to present the apple cake to Anthony?  I was trying to show you the inside.  The bag at a 45 degree angle.  Come in with the cake.  Come in with the cake.  That's right.  Come in with the cake.  Come in with the cake.  Now look what I have to do.  Now I have to rip off the part of the bag that you touched the inside of.  Because now when I pull the cake out, it won't touch the part of the bag that you were touching. 
[01:32:30]  Hey, can you put a fork between your ass cheeks and bring it to me?  Because I have to eat this.  I'm going to eat it with my bare finners.  Anthony, don't you want milk with your...  No.  Are you sure you don't want milk with your...  Maybe a little bit.  With your apple cake?  I need a fork.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  He is to open the bag with his right hand.  And hold the bag out to me at a 45 degree angle so I may reach into the bag without touching the paper. 
[01:33:00]  If there is any variation of these instructions, even to the smallest degree,  the entire process must be repeated from the beginning.  Come in with the milk.  Repeated.  Come in with the milk.  From the beginning.  Come in with the milk.  Repeated.  Come in with the milk.  From the beginning.  Repeated.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk.  Come in with the milk. 
[01:33:30]  Come in with the milk.  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself and he's just ugly and his nose is falling off.  I don't love it.  He's a asshole.  Eric Nagel is this bisexual incompetent radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him and he's not really that smart.  I'm sure I can go fuck himself. 
[01:34:00]  Ah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program, the ONA virus spreading across America.  It certainly is.  Frenchy's coming in today.  Wow.  It's an action packed show. 
[01:34:30]  Only the biggest guest for this show.  Jesus.  We got Frenchy and Big Kevin Studio with audio from Comic Book Convention.  I got juiced as soon as I walk in and start a prep sheet.  The big Comic Con.  Alright, well.  Another action packed show for the boys.  Star studded, I'd say.  I heard tomorrow's actually, tomorrow's actually be difficult. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah?  Hey Kev.  We actually have celebrity, what did they do, little promos for us?  Yeah, show IDs.  Show IDs, Opie.  Oh, well.  From some of the biggest celebrities in Hollywood.  Show IDs are very important to a radio show.  Yeah.  I didn't say that.  What, the biggest celebrities in Hollywood?  Keanu Reeves was there.  No, he wasn't.  No?  No, I saw on the commercial. 
[01:35:30]  Who were some of the bigger guests at this comic book geek fest?  There were a lot of people there.  Kate Beckinsale.  Kate Beckinsale.  Kate Beckinsale.  Wow.  I'd be cool to have an ID from her.  Who the fuck is she?  Who's Kate Beckinsale?  What'd she do?  Which one?  Laurel Canyon and all that.  Right.  Underworld.  Underworld.  Ben Helsing.  She was there?  Ben Helsing.  She is.  Unbelievable gorgeous.  She's one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood.  Working today, Anthony, as they say.  Working today.  Also, there was Charlize Theron. 
[01:36:00]  Holy crap.  A Charlize Theron ID?  I could handle that.  She's huge.  Quite the looker.  I can't wait to hear all these great IDs you got for the show.  We got one from Charlize and one from Beckinsale.  Who else was there?  Who else was there?  Who else did we get?  I didn't get IDs from...  You didn't get from...  From those two.  Well, obviously, there were bigger stars there that Kev was able to get IDs from.  Very exciting.  If there are bigger stars, if he was so busy getting them from the bigger stars than Charlize 
[01:36:30]  Theron, they must be just the best.  Today's show is now doing the Newlywed Game, Anthony.  What?  As Matt Lauer is the host.  Can we pot it up?  Are they going to recreate the...  In the butt?  Harry Potter it up.  All right.  Alan, what song best describes your relationship with Sarita?  Whoa.  Well, this is our second time around and I think we got it.  I think we figured this thing out.  No.  No.  This is our second time dating.  We reconnected.  That's a hot little piece of chocolate there, that guy's wife. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  Cool.  Now, Mark, what song best describes your relationship with Sarah?  I would have to say, I believe Fred Astaire sings that the way you sip your tea, the way  you sing off key, you can't take that away from me.  I thought it was...  In the butt, Matt.  In the butt.  Finally, Nick, what song best describes your relationship with Kim?  Can I sing it?  Sure.  But I can't sing.  Well, then don't sing it.  Eric Logan.  It's...  And I will always love you.  Oh, look. 
[01:37:30]  He was getting choked up.  Well, let's go.  Do we have time for the bonus question?  I have to bite his neck.  No.  It sounded like he got choked up there.  No time for the bonus question?  All right.  Let's bring the ladies back, okay?  Yeah.  Come on, ladies.  Come on back.  You've ever made whoopee.  In the butt.  In the butt.  In the butt.  So, back to Big Cavs.  So, we're looking forward to getting the audio of your fine trip to L.A.  Oh, yes we are.  This is star studded.  You went 3,000 miles for this.  Adrian Brody listens to the show. 
[01:38:00]  Adrian Brody.  Oscar winner.  I love him.  Adrian Brody.  Well, I look forward to playing that ID from time to time.  That's another good one.  The pianist.  I didn't...  I didn't get an ID from him.  Why?  How did you not get an ID?  He listens to the show.  Why wouldn't you get an ID?  How do you know he listens to the show?  I asked him.  What was he going to say?  No.  No.  Oh, those guys.  Yeah, those guys.  Hey, by the way, if you're a big celebrity and you're listening to the show, Adrian Brody,  call in. 
[01:38:30]  Give the show a call, please.  Come on, Adrian.  We did this last weekend.  The biggest celebrity was Richard Cheese.  We're trying to do a little bigger than Richard Cheese today.  And if you're listening to this on replay, because I know that's what they do in Hollywood  there, then call the show when we're live, please, the next time you're up early.  Yeah.  Because we want to see what big stars are listening to the Opie and Anthony program.  That's right.  That's an ongoing thing.  So what did Adrian Brody say?  Actually, it was him and Jack Black and Naomi Watts.  And Jack Black was saying that he had a good time when he was on the show and that the 
[01:39:00]  three of them ought to go in and do the show when Kong comes out.  Right.  And now, where did that come into?  Adrian Brody all of a sudden having a wow sticker on his car.  Where's this audio?  Now I've got to hear it.  What happened with Adrian Brody?  What did he say?  Nothing.  That's what I just said.  Adrian Brody probably went, yeah, cool.  We'll do that.  Yeah.  All right.  You just said that Adrian Brody listens to the show.  No, I said to Jack Black that...  Didn't he say that Adrian Brody listens to the show?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I did say that.  Well, shut up and I'll explain it, Jim.  Oh! 
[01:39:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  So, and I approached Jack Black, and I said who I was, and he said, oh, yeah, I  remember, we played foosball in New York when he and Colin Hanks were on, and he then 
[01:40:00]  greeted Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts and said, oh, this is- Hey Kap, can you speak  a little softer?  Because only ninety-nine percent of the audience just fell asleep.  Sorry.  Jesus Christ.  This is good.  We all want to talk like you it's early, but a little energy.  Yeah, come on, Masterpiece Theater.  They were playing foosball, and I believe the score was 5-4. 
[01:40:30]  Fine, fine, fine.  When they had to go back in the studio to the putting for birdie interview with you guys at that time.  That's it. That's the story.  No, it wasn't. It has to be more.  It has to be more.  That's it.  All right.  Let's say hi to Sean Penn.  Sean?  Hey.  What's up, Sean?  All right. How are you all doing?  Pretty good.  Sean Penn, everyone, calling from Hollywood.  Big star listening to the O.B. and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  I told you these guys were out there.  What's up, Sean?  Hey, man, I just want to let you all know that I do listen to you on the mornings I get up and I go work out. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, thank you, sir.  No problem. I think you all have got a great show.  Could you do me a favor?  Fast Times at Ridgemont High, one of my favorite movies of all time.  Can you just reenact one of your classic lines from the movie?  Do a little Jeff Spicoli.  All right. This is actually my favorite one I've ever done.  All right. You ready?  Yeah.  All right. Sean Penn, everyone.  Okay. Listen to this.  You know what that was?  What?  It was my skull, man.  Right. When he's hanging out talking to his buddy from the bathroom. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah. And I hit my head with the van shoe.  Right.  But I thought the line, Sean, was, it's my skull.  I'm so wasted.  Well, yeah. I didn't think you guys would remember the actual words.  No, Sean, we remember every word from that movie.  Well, your character was great in that.  Yeah.  Can you do one more line for us, please?  While we have you for this couple of minutes.  I'm going to Europe and jam with the Stones.  Yeah, it's got to be, Sean. 
[01:42:00]  I'm going to wing on over to London and jam with the Stones.  London, Europe, you know, it's over there.  Yeah.  All right, Sean.  Thank you so much for calling from Hollywood.  All right. You guys are doing a great job. See you.  All right, Sean.  I love this.  Well, we might as well go right back to the phones because all the big celebrities,  they're getting up now and having their morning coffee.  It's Samuel L. Jackson.  Samuel L. Jackson.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Hi, Samuel.  Hi, Sam.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Well, I got it right off the bat, I got to tell you,  and you probably hear it all the time.  Pulp Fiction, one of my favorite movies of all time. 
[01:42:30]  Thank you very much.  You want to hear a line from it?  Yeah, let's hear a line from that movie.  Swine is a filthy animal.  Great.  Don't eat swine.  When they're in the diner.  Yes.  Yeah.  Good.  But you don't really give it the oomph you did in the movie.  Yeah, I'm not really hearing the inflection you used in the movie.  You mean I don't sound the same as I do in the movies?  No, it's still close.  It's still waking up, you know?  It's close.  It's real close, but you put a little more into it in the movie.  I understand all you black actors.  You wake up white, and slowly but surely, after you have your coffee and stuff, 
[01:43:00]  you get the ghetto back into your voices.  Well, you know, it's different.  When I sit with Katie, I sound like this.  When I sit with Oprah, I don't sound like this.  I say, hello there, Oprah.  How are you doing?  Fun time.  All right, well.  And then Jackson there knows the lingo of the show.  That's very good.  Let's say hi to Cameron Diaz calling from Hollywood.  Cameron?  Yeah, this is Cameron.  Hi, Cameron.  How are you?  I'm doing all right.  Thanks for calling.  Justin Timberlake is over here nudging me a little bit.  Hold on. 
[01:43:30]  Justin Timberlake is in bed with you.  Yeah.  This is an exclusive, Anthony.  We enjoy when celebrities call from the bed.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  He's got it.  He's been.  Your voice, it must be very early in the morning.  Well, it is over there in Hollywood, because your voice is a little, just a little raspier  and maybe even a little deeper than I'm used to hearing it.  Well, let me put the cigar on.  Hold on a second.  All right.  You smoking cigars?  Maybe that.  Maybe that.  Any better now?  Yeah.  Yeah, very good. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Now, that's the Cameron Diaz, we all know.  Okay.  You were very good in something about Mary.  Well, you know, the scooge in my hair worked out really well.  Yeah, and I liked how you were in the movie, kind of like without a bra on.  It was very sexy.  Very sexy.  I enjoyed it.  We know.  Oh, we're getting a problem with the phone.  Oh, that's too bad.  That's right.  Maybe Justin rolled over and fell over it when they kissed.  Why don't we take one more here and say hi to Jackie Chan.  Wow.  Calling from China.  Jackie.  Hey, guys. 
[01:44:30]  How you doing?  Hey, Jackie.  Jackie Chan, everyone.  I've been practicing my English.  And it's getting a lot better, I guess.  I always thought maybe that was some kind of put on, that you would be in those movies  and not be able to speak English, but you sound fine.  Oh, you guys got me.  All right.  I liked you in that one movie, the movie with the cop, and you can't communicate with each  other because you're Asian, and he's a muggle. 
[01:45:00]  He's a swogie.  Well, you are learning a lot of words.  Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?  Yep.  That was it.  That's it.  That's the line.  I nailed that one.  Very good.  All right, Jackie.  Thank you so much.  Punch it out.  We got one more, actually, Anthony, calling from New York City.  Yes, sir.  Hello.  Oh, hi.  This is Jimmy Norton.  I'm a big, fancy person.  How are you guys today? 
[01:45:30]  Well, hi.  Jim Norton.  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm a big Hollywood guy.  I'm on the Jay Leno Show.  Maybe you guys saw my performance?  Yes, we did, Jimmy Norton.  Okay, and I think I'll be in Washington at Caroline's this weekend.  Punch it out.  Washington, Caroline's.  He's all over the place.  The guy's trying to do fake plugs.  He doesn't even know the venue.  From what I remember, Jimmy plugged a lot better than that.  Jimmy would have said something about Cleveland this coming Saturday.  The late show, maybe you have tickets, but that's just Jimmy, Ticketmaster.  Right.  Speaking of which, I got something for you, Jimmy.  Ooh.  Your day is the calling Ticketmaster for tickets to see old Jimmy Norton July 23rd at the Cleveland 
[01:46:00]  Odeon are over.  Oh, what smartasses.  That is funny.  That was a good one.  We can't end this bit without going to Tom Cruise, the biggest star in Hollywood.  Tom, you listen?  Yeah.  Hey, it's Tom Cruise.  What's up, Tom?  I'm sitting here in bed with Rob Thomas. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  An exclusive.  Yeah.  I thought the rumors were true.  I thought you got some lube on that first.  Ow.  Oh, shit.  I got to let you go.  Punch it out.  He knows the show lingo.  There you go.  Only the big stars for the program.  He ruined that bit fast.  He certainly did.  Awful overacting.  So, wait.  Why, what?  Because we interrupted Kevin.  He was actually finishing his story.  Oh, yeah.  Big Kevin.  Oh, right.  No, I finished the story.  No, you didn't.  No, I didn't.  You didn't.  No, I didn't.  Who could tell? 
[01:47:00]  No.  You said originally Adrian Brody listened to the show.  Right.  So, then you said Jack Black came off stage and said, Adrian Brody, we should go on the show.  Where does I listen to the show come into that story?  That's why I don't.  I didn't catch it.  Jack Black said, oh, he's from the Opie and Anthony show and they're on satellite radio.  And Adrian Brody says, oh, yeah, XM, I listened to that.  Oh, XM, I listened to that.  Okay.  Sorry.  I drew a conclusion.  All right.  Yeah, you took a big step there.  I got it.  Let's say hi to Sarah, Jessica Parker, Anthony, calling from New York City. 
[01:47:30]  Sarah.  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Hi, Sarah.  I was just leaving the set and my driver had your show on.  Yeah.  And to be honest, I didn't like it.  Two years ago, I heard you call me Ruth Buzzy and I did not appreciate that.  Well, you kind of look like you could be Ruth Buzzy's daughter.  You know what?  You know what?  I don't think so.  And if you guys want to come down to the set, we can work this out.  Set of what?  Think faster, Jessica.  All right.  Kirstie Alley.  Good morning, Kirstie.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Kirstie Alley? 
[01:48:00]  Bitch, I'm a big fan of this show.  I just get tired of Jimmy making fun of me all the time.  I don't mean.  I'm just trying to be silly.  I'd love to say you don't want me to test there.  It's a sweet dance.  Oh, what is that?  A bad phone?  She's eating her phone.  Having a problem taking a bite out of it.  All right.  Can you just shut the F up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Battle Stations.  Battle Stations.  Dive.  Dive.  Dive.  Dive.  The Puerto Rican lady stands up. 
[01:48:30]  Boyfriend turns to me and goes, oh, now you put her in battle mode.  Like she's a frigging transformer.  I put her in battle mode.  Even he went like, oh, that's it.  Nothing I can do.  She's in battle mode.  Oh, why don't you turn it off?  That's very funny.  A little, uh, people are, uh, talking liberties with our clips. 
[01:49:00]  Let's go to Martin in New York.  Martin?  Hey, Martin!  Martin!  I got a little birthday present for Jimmy Norton.  Oh, yeah?  Here on the post on the page 33.  Yeah.  The women, they want their Botox where?  Yes, female patients are getting their Botox in super sensitive areas.  Oh, to like puff up the vag?  Eh, you read the article, that's not really what it is, but yeah, it sounds like it.  They try to be racy and they just spoil it.  What is it all about?  Oh, I guess some woman got Botox in their underarms and it quits perspiration and the 
[01:49:30]  rest of the article goes on how women are getting Botox in their bikini line.  Ew, good fat underarms.  That's attractive.  Yeah.  You can't tell if they're lymph node cancer.  But, you know, they're getting closer and closer for you, Jimmy.  Nice, meaty.  That's what I like.  Yeah.  I'm with you on that one.  When a girl wears panties, I want it to look like when Freddy Krueger was coming through  the wall.  Remember the way his face got lying on the wall?  Stretching out, yeah, pushing out.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  You want that little thumb coming out of there?  Lovely.  I want an obscene lump that she's embarrassed to wear anything but a skirt with.  I want her whole high school life to have been tortured with pussy buried in the locker  while she put her underwear on.  She was so worried the other girls would look at it and call her silly putty box.  I smell bit.  But, every time you describe how you want a woman to look down there, you come up with  a new analogy.  Yeah.  A new one.  It's wonderful.  All right, guys.  The great last two weeks, by the way.  Thanks, bud.  Whatever.  Smashing radio.  Whatever. 
[01:50:30]  Smashing.  Maybe that's today's bit.  We're always looking for the bit of the day.  Yeah.  Well, what do you want to do?  Well, Norland just does a great job describing the vag and how he wants it to look.  Yeah.  You've come up with five or six already.  I've been keeping track.  You want the listeners to come up with something like that?  Well, man.  You're a madman.  Well, the Freddy Krueger thing's brilliant, man.  Well, maybe Nathaniel or somebody could put a few of them together.  It doesn't have to be now, but it could just be something.  Find them.  We'll keep track of that, because he did five or six.  He did the chimp's mouth, right? 
[01:51:00]  Or whatever the chimp's...  Chimp's face.  Chimp's face.  Scooby snack.  Scooby snack.  Been a lot.  Been a lot.  All right.  I've been so many stars checking in.  I don't know if we have the time now, Ant.  It's a big show in Hollywood.  I knew there had to be a couple, at least, but, man, there's quite a few.  Owen Wilson, what's up?  Hey, I'm a great big fan of your guys' show.  Hi, Owen.  But they had the story wrong in the paper.  It actually sounds like a little bit.  It was actually Wes Anderson's ass.  I was looking for two hours. 
[01:51:30]  What?  Wes Anderson's ass?  Oh.  Yeah, it was Wes Anderson's ass I was looking, actually, for the last five years.  Because he does a lot of Wes Anderson films.  Right.  That would be the best thing he was doing.  Not too funny, though.  You're a car.  Good work.  All right, Owen.  Thank you.  Ouch.  Won't you join me?  No.  That battle doesn't allow it. 
[01:52:00]  Oh.  Please, can we hear that again?  Please.  The nightmare continues.  No.  No.  The battle nightmare continues.  Won't you join me?  No.  Pat battle doesn't allow it.  Allow it.  No.  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  Pat battle.  Oh, it's the greatest.  I want to go ballistic with Pat Battleclips.  Believe me.  Yeah.  And that was one of the ones I thought of.  I love the people that are putting these together. 
[01:52:30]  No.  Fantastic.  The greatest moment in Clockwork Orange is he's just quiet for a second, and he goes,  Food!  All right.  He can't even contain his rage.  No, he is so mad.  He's just glaring at him, and he blurts out, Food, all right, because he's just chowing down  on spaghetti after he raped and killed his wife.  All right. 
[01:53:00]  Why don't we go to break with Howard Stern talking about XM Satellite Radio.  Yes.  Radio.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for  the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news,  sports, talk, and comedy, all in digital quality sound.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service. 
[01:53:30]  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  XM.  Check it out, electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City, Beyond AM, Beyond  FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Like sun through the hourglass, so is the old name virus.  We loved Eddie, but he was a little slow.  He was like...  A little slow.  It could have been Rosie O'Donnell's brother in that movie that was on the other night. 
[01:54:00]  You know what?  They gave him the job of taking the garbage out.  This was his job.  Take the garbage out.  Dude, you know he can't trash Eddie.  I'm not trashing him.  I'm just kind of telling him, wait, you think he could work in XM radio?  He wouldn't worry about it.  He's not hearing this.  Good point.  Whenever you give somebody who's a little mentally challenged a job, they will talk about it to  you like it is the most important thing in the world.  Oh, it's very important to them, Eddie.  Very important.  You know, the garbage don't stop.  Every day is all this garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage. 
[01:54:30]  I remember once he was going on vacation and he was very worried that no one would take  care of the garbage.  Yeah.  That was going to pile up.  Like it's going to pile up and Viacom is going to go under.  Who's going to take care of the garbage?  I'm essential to the Viacom effort.  He's still there, probably.  Stop it.  He's still there.  He lasted a lot longer than we did.  Of course he is.  So go ahead, Anthony.  So that was his job.  I don't know how that translated into giving him the job of delivering the mail.  So you'd go up to your mailbox.  It was like a bunch of little cubby holes in the wall that had everyone's mail in it. 
[01:55:00]  It had your little name tag on it.  And you'd grab your mail out of it and look through it.  And every name that worked at Viacom was in your mailbox except for yours.  And you'd look around.  And remember, our checks would be in there, paychecks.  And, like, I'd pull it out and go, oh, Earl Douglas.  Great.  I have Earl's paycheck.  And you know it's not going to be that much because he's a black guy.  You can barely get lunch on his paycheck and Earl somewhere is buying a brand new BMW with your paycheck. 
[01:55:30]  So he would just walk around and just, he would just take, like, four envelopes and shove them in one of the holes.  Take three of another, shove them in another hole.  Not paying attention.  And then every so often he'd come in the office, point at someone, and go, who's this?  Who's this?  And he'd point at the name.  And if he did that to Ben Say it, said Earl Douglas on it, Ben would go, oh, yeah, that's Don Geronimo. 
[01:56:00]  And still he couldn't read anyone's name tag, so he would just shove it in.  And we used to explode.  But we didn't want to get Eddie in trouble or make him feel bad so we could never say it on the air.  Well, the other thing is you were going through a lot of heavy personal shit.  Oh, my God.  And you had a lot of –  I had no address.  My ex-wife was living at my place in Huntington.  So my mailing address was 888 7th Avenue. 
[01:56:30]  It was the NEW building.  That was my mailing address where I got bills and legal things and stuff for my divorce and everything.  And so all of a sudden my cell phone gets turned off.  And I'm like, where is my – and then I'm thinking, oh, my God, I haven't gotten a phone bill in months.  And I look, and apparently Eddie was throwing them away.  Because occasionally he would just throw the mail away.  Like garbage. 
[01:57:00]  Look like garbage.  Garbage, garbage.  Garbage, you know, garbage never stops, guys.  Garbage never stops.  And he would throw them away.  And then we would get these big packages once there were mic flags.  Then we got a big delivery of mic flags, those little cubes with the company logo, the station logo that goes on your microphone.  And we were wondering why it was taking so long to get these things.  We were doing a lot of press at the time.  A lot of TV stations would come in and tape us.  And there was nothing identifying what station we were on on the microphone. 
[01:57:30]  So we ordered a bunch of mic flags.  And every so long we'd be like, where are the mic flags?  We never got them.  It turns out Eddie had received the box and put it in a storage closet without telling anybody.  Just opened up the big – and it was a mechanical closet where the air conditioning units are and stuff.  The big lower furnace units and everything.  And just threw the box in there.  And then the time with the television.  The TVs. 
[01:58:00]  There was like 30 TVs.  30 TVs were coming upstairs.  Oh, yeah.  Another prize thing.  There were prizes or TVs that were going to be used for 1010 Winds, the sister station upstairs.  So they came to the freight elevator downstairs.  And Eddie's in charge of bringing them up.  So wasn't it one of the homeboys?  Yeah, it was the homeboys and it was the guys in the garage.  And the guys in the garage in the home.  And we went, hey, Eddie, can I have one of those TVs?  Oh, sure.  Okay.  Okay.  No problem.  Guys.  Eight TVs missing. 
[01:58:30]  Eight TVs missing.  They came in and just ravaged this retard's television delivery.  It's like, Eddie, where are the TVs?  Oh, a couple of guys downstairs took some.  No, you idiot.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so tired of waiting, waiting for us to. 
[01:59:00]  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so sick of waiting for us to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  And we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  It's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  And we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Wake up, wake up.  We hold in front of us the Harry Potter glossary. 
[01:59:30]  Ooh.  Because Harry Potter's all the rage.  Jimmy, what is a bludger?  A bludger.  I won't look at the glossary I have, but I'll put it down.  Let me guess.  What is a bludger?  A bludger.  As far as Harry Potter goes.  The proper term for a man who runs on the subway with a hammer.  A bludger. 
[02:00:00]  Very good.  Very good.  How about Bogart?  Maybe a gnome that doesn't pass the joint.  Yeah.  A gnome.  Wouldn't that be a muggle?  No, no, no, no.  No?  A muggle is a gnome that marries outside of his race.  How about a butterbeer?  Butterbeer?  Mm-hmm.  It's what your beer turns into after Owen Wilson drinks out of it? 
[02:00:30]  How about the Chamber of Secrets?  A place where Ben keeps all of our good guests?  Hey, very good.  What else, Ant?  You see any other ones that are worth doing here?  I'm looking, but... 
[02:01:00]  How about flu powder?  F-L-O-O powder.  Flu powder.  What Ben said was on his mirror.  How about the Forbidden Forest?  Oh, the Forbidden Forest?  Mm-hmm.  Um, I don't know.  I don't know that one.  All right, it goes on and on. 
[02:01:30]  Maybe we'll test you a little more later on in the program.  There's a radio tease for you.  Oh, by the way, Anthony, reports are coming in.  Let's go to Rick in Staten Island.  Rick?  Hey, you guys were just on a today show when they were doing the dating game.  Yeah, you're doing the newlywed game.  Newlywed game.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, another assault on the media.  Very successful this morning.  Opie and Anthony signs all over the Today Show.  Yes.  You know what the Forbidden Jungle is?  Huh?  Pat battles legs. 
[02:02:00]  What are you waiting for, sir?  Yeah, very good.  Hang up on yourself.  Hang up on yourself.  Sometimes we make you hang up on yourself.  That's right.  Sometimes it's a privilege to be hung up on this program.  Some people would say the Forbidden Jungle are certain streets north of other streets.  It was forest.  Oh.  You turned it into a jungle for the joke.  I didn't remember.  Yes, Anthony. 
[02:02:30]  Forbidden housing complex?  That's easy.  You're right.  Phones are going nuts.  Yes.  Yes.  A successful assault on the media.  Yeah.  Done on the Today Show.  Gotta love it.  That sign kept popping up behind Matt and Katie.  Too bad Adrian Brody wasn't being interviewed.  He could have turned around.  That's my favorite show.  We'll have video up on OpenAnthony.com later today.  And some still shots.  Yes.  It was very successful. 
[02:03:00]  Adrian Brody, big fan.  Really?  What'd he say?  Well, Jack Black mentioned XM and he didn't yell, what the fuck is that?  All right.  More Harry Potter crap.  He's heard of satellites.  That's right.  He knows they exist.  Because what happened was Jack Black said, they're on XM.  And he goes, what is that?  Is that like AM or FM?  And he goes, yeah, but it's different.  And Adrian Brody went, okay.  Rob J. from Cleveland.  Chamber of Secrets equals Jimmy's apartment. 
[02:03:30]  Oh.  All right.  Hurt me if you want.  I like the Jimmy's better.  I'm an easy target.  All right.  And there's other people coming in with definitions.  More Harry Potter, Anthony.  Part two of Katie Keurig's exclusive interview with the author of the Harry Potter novel.  Listen to this.  The magic of Harry Potter has captivated the hearts and minds of readers worldwide.  This morning, through the magic of television, we transport you to Edinburgh, Scotland, the home of his creator. 
[02:04:00]  And voila.  Isn't this a fitting place for a Harry Potter convention?  And that's exactly what happened here at Edinburgh Castle this past weekend,  when scores of young muggles got to meet with J.K. Rowling as she launched her new book,  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Ooh.  Yuck.  Well, we asked some of our viewers to write in their questions. 
[02:04:30]  Okay.  I wish I could have brought hundreds of children in my suitcase.  That would have been illegal.  If you'd chop them up, right?  Very dangerous.  Laugh.  Oh, that would have been very dangerous.  Yes.  Your son is attempting to bring an outside party into this situation.  A muggle.  A muggle.  Cook.  Cook.  Well, we asked some of our viewers to write in their questions.  Okay.  I wish I could have brought hundreds of children in my suitcase. 
[02:05:00]  That would have been illegal.  I wish I could have made it funny.  But it was hard to fit a hundred children with my slips, old lady dresses, and diapers.  Irrelevant bag of meat.  Shut your mouth.  Thanks.  For a suitcase filled with tampons, just in case.  Just in case.  Christy and Beth from Slinger, Wisconsin. 
[02:05:30]  This is a good question.  What is a question that you wish people would stop asking you?  Oh, that's so mean.  I hope none of mine qualify.  No.  I don't know.  She's good.  Where's the rest of the interview?  Do you really want more?  Yes.  It's over, Johnny.  I wanted to see more of her questions. 
[02:06:00]  Look at Nathaniel.  He's like, please, no more.  More?  He's been working on Harry Potter stuff all morning.  Look at him.  He's a beaten man.  I want to know what happened.  What else did Katie ask?  No.  No.  No.  He's going to ask more.  Uh-oh.  He went to the board of writing.  Oh, no.  See, they write on the board now and hold it up.  What does it say?  That's why it's called the board of writing.  It stinks.  It stinks.  Very good.  Took it that long to write.  It stinks?  Yeah.  As opposed to don't stink. 
[02:06:30]  Is it really a bad movie?  As opposed to a good one?  I don't know why Jay sounds just like him.  I sound like an 80-year-old Jew.  As opposed to good.  Oy.  Ugh.  I made a note for myself.  You did?  Because we always go off on tangents.  What were we supposed to talk about after the break, Anthony?  The horse.  Oh, you did remember.  I got it right up here.  I started forgetting all of a sudden.  I got it right up here.  You guys remember the horse story from Friday?  We dropped the ball on this one.  Severe.  Severe.  Yeah.  We talked about the story.  It was a guy that was killed having sex with a horse. 
[02:07:00]  Now, we assumed that he was up on the little stool.  Jimmy actually made a little comment about the guy up on the stool behind the horse, screwing  the horse, and got kicked, and died of internal injuries.  The story is so much better, even though Jimmy's comedy is brilliant.  Jimmy brought up the point that the horse is in the stall with the other horses who don't  want to make eye contact with that horse.  They're all embarrassed.  Yeah.  They all look away, and they see the guy walking in the barn with the stool. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, with the stool.  They all look away.  You know, it's coming.  Well, it wasn't that.  That was not the case.  He was not kicked by the horse.  Stupid us.  Stupid us.  Who didn't see this coming?  Seattle man died after engaging in anal sex with a horse at a farm suspected of being  a gathering place.  All right.  So, we got that part right.  Um, no.  No.  He wasn't having anal sex with the horse.  He wasn't screwing the horse in the anus.  He was being screwed by the horse. 
[02:08:00]  I'm scared of you.  He was under the horse, getting fucked in the ass by a horse cop.  Oh, exactly.  And, uh, yeah, we didn't see that one coming.  Wow.  He died of a perforated colon.  Internal injuries.  And a sore throat.  Jesus.  You're right through him.  Skewered.  He probably figured that they probably have the horse harness, so it only puts it in a 
[02:08:30]  little bit.  And I bet you the horse got so excited.  Why do you think?  Because, obviously, what's a horse harness?  Yeah.  Something that will hold the horse back from thrusting completely, because you know you can  be killed.  I mean, the horse, it just felt so good.  It just pumped harder than everyone thought.  I think he thought he could probably, you know, move forward if the horse really, if you've  ever seen, you know, I used to have horses back in California, and if you, you ever saw  when you bred these things, the male horse goes insane.  It just goes insane. 
[02:09:00]  It's like Spock during a muck time.  They just go crazy.  And they have a heart on this about three feet long.  Hold on.  I got to...  What?  Just like what?  Spock.  You ever see an episode?  No, it's not, Professor.  That's just Star Trek trivia.  A muck time, where he had to go back to Vulcan to breed.  You're with him, right?  Yeah, that's a recall that I would have had.  Every Star Trek geek knows what I'm talking about.  Sometimes my references are very focused at just a few people out there. 
[02:09:30]  Can you explain to us muggles?  No, that I can't.  Sorry.  Spock goes crazy every so often.  He has to go back to Vulcan.  Right.  Every seven years, I think it is.  Or, yeah, he goes nuts, has to go to Vulcan, and pretty much get laid.  That's what he's got to do.  He's got to go through this ritual, a little fight,  dan-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an-an, you know, music,  and then everyone's happy, and they're back on the ship.  But my point was he goes nuts, and the horses are the same thing. 
[02:10:00]  They lose any rationality they had.  They're gone.  And they rip up the female horse.  They jump up on its back.  The hooves are grabbing around its neck.  They're kicking.  And that schlong, sometimes it doesn't even get in the female horse,  and it starts going off like a fire hose.  They get so excited.  Oh, and it hits your face.  The horse is all embarrassed.  He's going to apologize to her, drive her home. 
[02:10:30]  See, the part of the story that we really missed was it did kill the guy,  but now it's reported that the horse has been visited by friends,  and he's just laying in the barn in a robe.  Jesus.  And he has a little dog that will come over and head it occasionally.  A little dog.  His friends come over and water his plants for him.  I can't stand up without getting dizzy.  You do realize this show has three jokes.  That's it. 
[02:11:00]  We have three fucking jokes.  Three lousy jokes.  All this talent in one room, and we have three fucking jokes.  Al in North Carolina.  They are doozies.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up, Al?  I love you.  Hi.  Pot battle, shining references, and the robe joke.  Right.  That's what we do every day.  There's three jokes.  You know how much we get paid for three lousy jokes?  I'd like to know.  Al, what's up?  Hey, I saw you on the media with Katie and Matt. 
[02:11:30]  It was great.  All the way down to North Carolina, you saw that, huh?  Yeah, I've been a listener since about a year and a half.  Love the hell out of your jokes.  Your show, little Jimmy, you're the biggest slut muffin around.  Oh, cut it out.  A little pet name.  Focus.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  All right.  You guys have a great day, man.  He just loved the assault on the media is what he wanted to say.  It was funny because he kept shooting up quickly.  Every time they'd go to that cut, the little, you know, sign would just pop up. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, it would fly up.  It was kind of funny, actually.  Joe in Brooklyn.  A lot of movement in that assault on the ass.  How you doing, guys?  What's up, Joe?  I got a question.  Now that this horse technically killed this guy, are they going to shoot the horse?  You always have to shoot the animal, Anthony.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I think this guy pretty much put himself in harm's way.  Yeah.  Oof.  All right.  You ever see some of those videos online with the chicks?  Yeah.  Like they're sucking off the horse and unloads right in the girl's face.  We saw a horse gag. 
[02:12:30]  A horse gag was a good one.  But this guy decided he was.  What?  How?  How gay do you have to be?  Oh.  Shark story?  Ouch.  Well, this morning, Frank is in Montauk, New York.  Frank, good morning.  I missed it.  Good morning.  I'm not only in Montauk, I'm in beautiful Star Island Yacht Club.  Well, it sounds like you're having a good morning so far.  Shark hunter.  Let me just ask you this with all due respect, sir.  This Jaws character, Captain Quint, was nasty, reckless, and just a little bit crazy. 
[02:13:00]  So how much were you like him, actually, in your earlier days?  Well, in my earlier days, there was a lot of whiskey involved.  But we got out of that.  Yes, we were reckless.  Yes, I will say that.  And in those years, or something like 60 years, you captured and killed something like 50,000 sharks.  They're tenderizing, don't you go? 
[02:13:30]  But you changed from those earlier days.  You've actually gone from being a shark hunter to being a shark conservationist.  What caused this change, Frank?  Oh, that's so cute.  Well, it's very simple.  You're running out of fish.  And because we're running out of fish, we have to conserve the fish.  So that's what we're trying to do, is to conserve the fish.  Yes.  Well, you know, some people might not want to conserve sharks.  So, Frank, because, you know, we've heard about so many shark attacks, including the ones so far this summer.  There were two shark attacks just this day. 
[02:14:00]  Is that so many, you asses?  There were two.  There were two.  What do you say to people who don't think that these particular kinds of fish are worth worrying about?  Well, you see the problem now.  See, we're back.  Well, we're back on the sharks.  Yeah.  It's all about the sharks again.  So another good story comes around.  All right, Anthony.  Sorry, let's get back to that horse story.  So it gets a lot better.  Yeah, he was down at this farm.  He got under the horse.  The horse stuck it in and gave him internal injuries, which he later died from. 
[02:14:30]  But it turns out that this farm that he was at, it's known as a gathering place for people looking to have sex with livestock.  They have everything down there.  Chickens, goats, cows, horses.  And if you want to have sex or let these things have sex with you, it was known that you went to this farm and went down there and had sex.  It's been going on for years, they say.  You could pick the animal and everything.  Sure.  It's like a little whorehouse. 
[02:15:00]  You go down there.  You look around.  You want to fuck a chicken?  There's a chicken.  Stick it in.  Do we have a number for this farm?  We've got to call them.  They're giving no information on the farm.  Maybe our crack research team here can find out where it is.  We'll give them a call.  Wouldn't you love to know, like, after, like, a couple goes and fucks two different animals,  what do you talk about in the drive home after you both had your orgasm?  Like, you know how you come and you come back down to earth?  Yeah, yeah.  When you're driving home, what do you discuss?  Something a little freaky seems totally normal. 
[02:15:30]  Then you shoot and then you feel a little weird about it.  Look down and there's a feather in your zipper.  You're like, ugh, what happened to me?  How was your chicken?  Yeah.  I wanted to be an astronaut growing up.  Just fuck the chicken.  Jesus.  Is there a moment where you're showering and you're like, my dick has slime on it and it's  from a chicken?  From a chicken.  From a horse.  It'll wash chicken crap off.  Or do you get in the car with your buddy that you went down there with and high-five  and go, yeah, I fucked that chicken. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  All proud of it.  Probably.  Probably.  What would be the number one animal?  Well, you've got to think sheep, right?  Well, they say the sheep is the closest to a human vag.  They say having sex with a sheep vag is the closest to a human vag.  But I would say, yeah, probably the sheep.  And then for the gay guys, you know, a pony.  Give them a pony.  Let them slip. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, good lord.  And, uh, enjoy.  I wonder if that guy had to go to the hospital.  I wonder if he died instantaneous.  I would love to know.  No, he went to the hospital.  A friend drove him to the hospital.  A friend.  A friend.  By the farm owner.  Drove him to the hospital and dropped him off and left.  Didn't even go in with him.  Would you have?  No.  So that's the real story, though.  There's a sex farm out there somewhere?  Sex farm.  So the horse thrusted in, just wrecked his intestines.  Yeah.  God, is he, I'm so happy he's dead. 
[02:17:00]  Busted him up inside.  All right, let's, uh, let's say hi to Patrick in Tennessee.  Patrick?  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  I just wanted you to check on your facts about Star Trek.  I believe that, uh, it's called Pon Far, is it not?  As opposed to Amok?  Well, it's Amok time, and then the, uh, that's the ritual that he had to go through.  Ah, I understand.  I'm sorry I'm mistaken.  Go ahead and crash me.  No, that's fine.  Good to talk to you, Jimmy.  I just wasn't getting into real specifics there. 
[02:17:30]  Well, Jimmy and I knew that, too.  We just, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just wanted you to get the credit for that one, so I'd like to spread the credit around here.  Jesus.  All right.  Hey, Jimmy, I had another idea, too, about a nice-looking vag.  How about the thighs of a nice little midget?  Nice, pumped-up vag that way.  I got it.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Punched out.  Someone in Instant Feedback had a good one.  He wanted to look like Dizzy Gillespie's cheeks.  He's a trumpet player. 
[02:18:00]  Maybe a little lighter than that, though.  Yeah.  I may be so bold.  Matt, what's up?  Hello.  What's up, Matt?  Let's go.  Hey, uh, I was, when I was younger, I was in North Carolina, and I spent a good part of  the day in court for a traffic violation.  But I'll tell you what, a lot of the people in there were waiting on, uh, bestiality charges.  Really?  What do you mean, a lot?  Uh, probably three-quarters of the courtroom.  And these people had to stay.  What was it, bestiality night? 
[02:18:30]  I guess it's just a popular pastime there.  And why were you in court?  Not much to do besides drink and, uh...  Why were you in court?  I got pulled over for drinking and driving, but I was up on vacation.  I remember when I got to sit there and just listen to all these people answer to the charges.  It was pretty, uh, pretty funny.  Sure translated that way.  All right, sir.  Yeah, so I guess it's a popular pastime up there. 
[02:19:00]  All right, thank you.  I remember when I was a kid, my buddy Dean had to go to court.  So me and my friend Kenny, uh, Hines went to court to support him.  And while Dean was waiting for his case to be called, one of the cases was a guy who was on the court stand testifying how his stepson had smashed him in the head with a frying pan.  And me and Kenny were laughing because the guy looked like Dudley's father from different strokes.  This may be so...  Remember awful Dudley's father?  And you're laughing at...  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  We always got thrown out.  We were just snickering.  Well, you should have been thrown out.  I remember the Dudley episode where he was molested.  Yeah.  He got left in the basement.  In a bike shop.  In a bike shop?  Yeah.  Smooth black legs.  Like piano keys.  How do you not touch them?  Wow.  All right.  I think we, uh, we'll take a break.  All right?  Just a quick break because, uh, we've got to get prepared for Big Kev's, uh, interviews. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, that's where we were.  I think that's where we were going.  Hold on, ladies and germs.  Not interviews.  We always get, uh, off track.  Who are some of these people that interviewed, uh, Big Kev?  Why don't we play them and see if we can figure it out?  Oh, really?  They probably say who they are.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Hi, I'm...  Exactly.  All right.  We'll go through them and see if we know.  Don Levin.  Everyone knows who Don Levin is.  Yes.  Don Levin.  Who the...  Some of them are just funny. 
[02:20:30]  Don Levin.  Uh-huh.  Richard Hatch?  Not the one you're thinking of.  I know who Richard Hatch is.  Oh.  Thomas Jane?  Holy crap.  How'd you get him?  He was there, I asked.  Oh, no.  I...  Oh.  We have no idea who that is.  Jimmy, of course...  I know Thomas Jane.  Thomas Jane?  Yeah, I do not.  Jimmy, tell him.  Um, he, uh...  He's involved with comic books and stuff.  No, he's not.  He's somebody who, if he walked in right now, you'd fall over yourself to get a picture with. 
[02:21:00]  Really?  Ooh, really?  Who was he?  Who was he?  He was in The Punisher.  Never saw it.  He was in...  I didn't care less about him.  Oh, which guy was he?  The Punisher.  Oh, he's The Punisher?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Is that good?  That was a good movie.  Well, judging by the film he did, apparently he created this radio segment.  It's been in other things.  Okay.  Hey, what's that?  Well, you've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the centerpiece  of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes. 
[02:22:00]  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  is...  is...  is...  is...  is...  is...  is...  is...  is...  a fucking rock, you dildo.  a fucking rock, you dildo.  a fucking rock, you dildo.  waitin'.  Give me a gold-hot bitch.  She was shaking her head, girl, that was all that I need.  you're all right over there. 
[02:22:30]  You're just going to adjust my chair.  These chairs are the weirdest things.  Looks like you were wrestling with a shark.  It's got, like, all kinds of notches and things that happen with them.  Like, all kinds of...  Sounds like you're loading a gun.  Yeah.  It's like my armrest.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  I'm trying to get through the goodness. 
[02:23:00]  Is that your Honey Nut Cheerios, or...  Yeah.  It's like a hurricane.  Pour in the filter.  Breakfast with Opie.  Every morning.  Every fucking morning.  This is not a real show. 
[02:23:30]  Who does this?  There's three jokes and eating.  That's what this show is.  Edward R. Murrow, I'm sure, did just this.  Oh, he's spinning.  Well, anyway.  Yeah, anyway.  Play some tape.  We've got big kids' interviews from L.A.  They're not interviews.  They're show IDs.  Oh, these are just show IDs? 
[02:24:00]  With famous, famous people.  I can't wait to hear Jack Black's.  You got Jack Black?  No, I didn't.  What if it was on the show one?  Yeah.  What happened?  You asked him?  No, I didn't ask him.  Why?  Because it was inappropriate at the time.  Why?  Because they were leaving.  They were hanging out for a few minutes and then just leaving.  And it was way too loud.  So instead, we got this guy.  Who's this?  Yo, what's going on?  This is Aaron Magruder, creator of the Boondocks. 
[02:24:30]  I'm listening to the Opie and Anthony show on X...  Fuck.  XM Radio?  XM Satellite Radio.  XM Satellite Radio.  All right.  Take two.  Yo, what's up?  This is Aaron Magruder.  I'm listening to Opie and Anthony...  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Take three.  Take your time.  Hey, what's up, y'all?  It's Aaron Magruder, creator of the Boondocks.  I'm listening to the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  Y'all heard...  I don't know.  Am I supposed to say something else?  I normally just do that. 
[02:25:00]  All right.  We'll do one more.  It's XM Radio?  You can cuss.  You can cuss.  It's XM Radio.  Yeah, you can cuss.  You can say whatever you want.  I really don't have anything derogatory or profane to say.  That's ridiculous.  That's a lot.  All right, what's going on, y'all?  It's Aaron Magruder, creator of the Boondocks.  I was checking out the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio, and they're asking  you to curse, so shit.  Who is that?  Aaron Magruder.  He does a black cartoon. 
[02:25:30]  He does a paper comic strip.  Yeah, they say nigger a lot, I think, on the cartoon.  Yeah, there's an article in the paper about it.  Actually, it's coming on cable really soon, and they showed us clips of it there.  Everyone's going to be talking about it.  The Boondocks?  Yeah.  It's called the Boondocks.  Did you have it written out, like the thing your name is?  No.  Because I didn't.  I figured it's two sentences, and he'd be able to remember it.  Oh, Boondocks.  Boondocks.  Oh, okay.  So, like most of the celebrities, he's making...  I thought it was a doctor show.  No.  Wow.  Sorry.  So, he's making believe he listens to us. 
[02:26:00]  That's cute.  Yeah.  Could you do this?  Hi, my name is Charisma Carpenter, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Whoa.  Let's do one more just to be safe.  Who the hell is Charisma Carpenter?  She's right there on the wall.  Yeah, she's hot, but who is she?  Who is she?  She's from Buffy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Of course.  This is...  These celebrities are so bad, they actually have to list their credits first.  Yeah, that's kind of rough when you've got to say who you are.  I'm so-and-so, and I do this. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  You think Tom Cruise says, hi, this is Tom Cruise.  I was in War of the Worlds.  Okay.  Tom Cruise, Risky Business.  I was in ten of the greatest films of all time.  Let me look at them now.  I didn't know she would be a charisma pose nude like that.  Playboy.  Playboy?  Greatest films.  Wow.  She has nice areolas.  Steve just was in and said, I don't like those nipples.  I think they're too dark.  They're very dark.  Not only do I like them dark, I like them bigger.  Yeah?  You like them bigger than them?  I don't like nipples really dark. 
[02:27:00]  I like them small and pink.  Do you really?  Fat calves?  Just slices Achilles tendon.  Oh, we know this next celebrity.  We do?  Yes.  This is Clive Barker and you're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Holy shit.  What's wrong with Clive?  Nothing.  With his voice.  The way he said it.  Was that really Clive Barker?  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Do you have any contact information for him?  Sure.  This is Don Levine, the father of G.I. Joe, talking for O.P. and Anthony Show, XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:27:30]  Father of G.I. Joe.  Is he the creator of G.I. Joe?  The creator of G.I. Joe.  Get me hot coffee so I can throw it on him.  Creator of what?  The G.I. Joe figure?  Yeah, in the 40s.  Action figure in the 40s?  What's the matter?  Wasn't the guy who did the genital molds for Superstar Ken available?  Oh, God, I wish I had hot liquid in my hand.  This is Don Levine, G.I. Joe's dad, talking for O.P. and Anthony Show, XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:28:00]  Satellite?  What is that?  That's pretty impressive.  Oh, my G.I. Joe's.  Don Levine should fall down the elevator shaft.  People are signing up for this like crazy.  Yeah.  You can see why now.  Oh, of course.  Hello, darling.  This is Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, and you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  You're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we are.  She's right.

She's not in the makeup or anything, so it's just...  No, it's just her.  Cassandra Peterson, yeah.  Of course, because everyone knows her real name.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Cassandra Peterson was with her?

Hello, darling.  This is Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show  on XM Satellite Radio.  Who's that?  Elvira.  When?  That's Elvira from...  From 1958?  No. 
[02:29:30]  What a huge, hairy muff.  Guess the year, by the month.  You sure that's her?  I'm going to guess that's 74.  Yeah?  I was going to go with 78.  Any clue there?  She's hot.  All right.  It's very 70s, yeah.  Well, we know the next celebrity.  We do?  Oh, cool.  Nice.  Hello, discerning listener.  This is Tom Kenny, also known as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants, and you're listening  to the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Bye-bye-bye.  Well, that's a big star. 
[02:30:00]  Thank you, Kev.  Spongebob.  Thank you.  Nice.  That should help out our three to eight listening audience.  Jesus.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Spongebob.  Well, we got Spongebob Part 2 here, right?  Uh-oh.  You got more stuff from him?  Yes, I think.  Hey, air breathers.  This is Tom Kenny, also known as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants, and when I want to  fill my ear holes full of cool, cool sounds, I listen to the...  Hello, air breathers. 
[02:30:30]  This is Tom Kenny, also known as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants, and when Tom and I  want to...  I'm figuring it out as I go along, man.  I want to kill this guy.  Yeah, I got what I'm doing.  Yeah, this is good.  I'm sure it's going to be great.  Oh, with that voice.  Hello, vertebrates.  This is Tom Kenny, better known as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants, and when Tom and  I want to fill our ear holes with cool, cool sounds, we listen to the O.P. and Anthony  Show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:31:00]  Right, Tom?  Right, SpongeBob.  Oh, when he goes from his voice to that voice, it's killing me.  It goes right through.  That's what he does when he wants to fill his ear holes.  What do you do when you want to fill your asshole?  Do you go to a farm in Seattle?  Cool, cool sounds.  Yeah, because we're playing music and stuff.  He's a creep.  All right.  Well, another big star here, Kevin.  Thank you for this next one.  Nice.  This is wonderful.  Cool.  Hi, this is Aaron Gray from Buck Rogers in the 25th century, and you're listening to 
[02:31:30]  the O.P. and Anthony Show on the XM Satellite Radio.  She used to be hot back in 1975.  Is she still hot?  No.  No?  She's like old lady now?  Yeah.  Kind of.  See what she looks like.  Remember her?  This has got to be so depressing, these things, these junkets.  They all want to still be famous and stuff, right?  Clyde Barker is the legitimate.  Clyde Barker was the cool one for me so far.  Well, they've got a few that are still, you know, happening legit, but then it's filled 
[02:32:00]  with a lot of people that are hoping that there's...  Remember her?  We'll still be famous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's beautiful.  Let me see, Hawk.  Remember that lady?  Oh, yeah.  Aaron Gray?  Yeah.  Was she in Dallas?  Who was the lady in Dallas?  That was in one of those.  That was an actress named Gray, too, right?  Silver Spoons.  Something gray.  All right.  Here we go.  Another big star doing an ID for the program.  Hey, this is Hal Sparks from VH1's I Love the 80s and Queer as Folk, and you're listening  to the Opie and Anthony Show, and I think that speaks very poorly about you. 
[02:32:30]  I would just take up drinking.  And let's end it on XM Satellite Radio.  Let's end it.  Okay, cool.  Hey, this is Hal Sparks from VH1's I Love the 80s and Queer as Folk, and you're listening  to the Opie...  Everyone does XM Satellite Radio, which means you have money to... 
[02:33:00]  How'd that get cut off?  I was plagued with technical problems.  I think when it works, you're plagued with technical problems.  Hal Sparks, you got so mad at me in a tough crowd because I slammed the door like I would  do to people.  Right.  He got so pissed.  He hated my guts.  That's a great gag, by the way.  Oh, he was in mid-sentence, and I smashed the door shut, and he was just talking to no  one but a shut door.  Oh, basically, you ask a question, and they start answering, and you slam the door on my  face.  Hey, dude, what are you doing when you're out in L.A.? 
[02:33:30]  Well, I always start, flap!  In mid-sentence.  Oh, he got mad at that?  How do you not just laugh at that?  Because he's an L.A. guy, and that's the way they react.  He was really...  And he's like, well, maybe that's funny if you know somebody.  Shut up, stupid.  It's funny any time.  I enjoyed it.  Patrice enjoyed it.  Keith enjoyed it.  Yeah.  All right, the next big celebrity.  You're going to recognize this one, Anthony.  All right.  Anthony especially.  Whose faggot ringtone is that?  Oh, it's Big Kev's. 
[02:34:00]  Maybe this is one of the celebrities.  Or maybe that's the clinic going.  It's positive.  That's what it should be with that fucking ringtone.  That is your ringtone?  Yes.  It's classic.  Yeah, I know it is.  What's the matter?  They didn't have Philadelphia?  What is it?  XM Satellite Radio.  Hi, this is John Kane.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show on...  XM.  XM.  Satellite Radio.  Satellite Radio.  Wow. 
[02:34:30]  Okay.  I'll do one as Ren.  This is Ren Haunt.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Idiot Show.  On...  Satellite.  XM.  X-M.  One more with Howard Stern.  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  Here, dude.  Get her to do it.  I'm okay.  You're doing fine.  He's a real voice guy.  Do the thing with Howard Stern again for me.  What?  Do the one with Howard Stern...  Where you say Howard Stern at the end.  Well, I just didn't.  I know, but I missed it.  Oh.  Oh, it's poor God.  This is Ren Haunt. 
[02:35:00]  Toad's Tot.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show on...  XM Satellite Radio.  What was wrong with the sound on that one?  I was plagued with technical difficulties.  You're just plagued.  The plane making it out there was a technical difficulty.  Yeah, what did you do with him?  Did you crawl into a bathroom stall and say, right now, yell?  Here's the problem.  This is why you've got to have them written down, because none of these guys do it right.  Yeah.  Then you just hand it to them. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, you go, hey, I am, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony on...  What are you looking at?  I don't know.  He's looking at Poe.  Master Poe out the window.  I thought it might be a guest.  I forgot where I was.  Yeah.  I saw someone with an Opie and Anthony t-shirt on, and I assumed it was somebody that didn't  work here, but...  What amazes me...  What amazes me is that we actually pay someone to book celebs for this show, but we're not  supposed to talk bad about this company.  No, don't say a word.  No, don't say a word.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:36:00]  When was the last celebrity we had on the show in the studio?  I couldn't tell you.  I couldn't tell you.  I'm sure XM is happy to write that check every month.  Well, this is a cavalcade of stars we're getting on these recordings.  By the way, I disagree.  I don't think you should write anything down.  You should let these celebrities try to figure it out on their own.  Just so they get their name right and stuff.  Well, it's sure a confidence booster when half these people don't even know what XM is.  On XM?  What?  X what?  X who?  Where?  What?  How long is it going to be going to be? 
[02:36:30]  We'll just do a show ID.  Huh?  We'll just do a show ID.  Hi, this is Priscilla Barnes from Three's Company.  Hi, this is Priscilla Barnes from Three's Company and currently Devil's Rejects.  And I'm with the Opie and Anthony show at XM Satellite Radio at the Lionsgate booth in San Diego and Comic-Con.  Good.  Good?  How could you? 
[02:37:00]  As opposed to bad?  Priscilla Barnes, huh?  Who was she?  She was like...  She was like the third replacement for Chrissy.  She wasn't even the second replacement?  No.  No.  That was the other one.  Oh, wow.  Was her name?  Jenny Lee Harrison.  Jenny Lee Harrison.  And then they went to Priscilla Barnes.  Priscilla Barnes showed a tits in some movie recently.  What was it?  It was Mallrats.  Was it Mallrats?  Yes.  Not too recently then.  There's Mallrats right there, 1995.  How'd she look?  Not good.  Not good, huh? 
[02:37:30]  All right.  Why don't we move on here?  Yeah.  Good.  Hi, this is Priscilla Barnes.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony, and I should kill myself.  That's how that idea should go.  Yeah, she's got enough plugs in there.  The Lionsgate.  Yeah, no one's going to go there.  Oh, that's sick.  That's her right there, yeah.  Wow, she was old in 95.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Where's Larry Klein, by the way?  I want him.  Okay.  Hi, everybody.  This is Richard Hatch.  Battlestar...  Sorry.  Hi, everybody.  This is Richard Hatch, the original Captain Apollo on the original Battlestar Galactica. 
[02:38:00]  And you are listening to XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Where are you going again?  Hi, everybody.  This is Richard Hatch, the original...  Hi, everybody.  Hi, everybody.  This is Richard Hatch, and you're...  Hi, everybody.  This is Richard Hatch, the original Apollo on the original Battlestar Galactica.  And you are listening to the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  Let me do that one more time.  That was good.  Hi, everybody.  This is Richard Hatch, the original Apollo on the original Battlestar Galactica. 
[02:38:30]  And you are listening to the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio.  He's all bitter.  He is so bitter that he wasn't asked to be in the new Battlestar Galactica on, what, Syfy?  Yeah, on Syfy.  And, yeah, he's very upset.  He was the original Apollo.  Hollywood stinks.  They do this to these guys all the time, too.  Can't you throw these guys a bone?  Throw them a bone.  They're the ones that made the series popular or the character popular.  Just give them a little part, a little cameo. 
[02:39:00]  He probably wanted to be Adama or something.  He wanted to be the older starring role now.  Just give them something to acknowledge that you had something to do with this thing.  Yeah.  Nothing.  Instead of listing who he was, he should have just listed who he was.  And, hi, this is Richard Hatch.  Not the tax-avoiding faggot, but the other one that was in the spaceship.  They made, like, 12 Batman movies, and they didn't even give Adam West one little bone.  They offered him one.  One little part.  They offered him one in the second, and he turned it down.  Why? 
[02:39:30]  What was his reasoning?  I think because it was too small a part.  Too small a part?  Who do you want to play?  I don't know.  Hey, we got Stan Lee.  The creator of...  Stan Lee's a good one.  Oh, okay.  Of Spider-Man?  Yeah, a lot of Marvel comics.  Hulk.  And X-Men.  X-Men.  Punisher.  Star-Devil.  And Brenda Starr, I think, too, right?  I don't know if he created Brenda Starr.  I'm here with Stan Lee, legendary comics creator. 
[02:40:00]  And, Stan, I want to ask you just a couple of quick questions.  How do you feel about the continued success of your characters on the big screen, as well  as in the comic books?  I'm sure he hates it.  Good question.  That's a good question.  Not now.  Not now that he's sued and he's getting a piece of all of it.  That's a good question, because you never know how someone's going to feel about the  continued success of their work.  They might be very upset by it.  I like you.  I just wanted the ID.  I had to do questions to get there.  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  Let's see what the answer is. 
[02:40:30]  Hello?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now, can you do the ID?  Damn, Lee.  Hey, this is Stan Lee.  You're listening to me.  You're talking about all of your things.  You're still there. 
[02:41:00]  Technical glitch.  Well, it'll come as no surprise to you.  I feel pretty damn good about it.  Are you enjoying your cameos that you seem to get in all of the films of your creations?  That's the most fun I could have.  You know, I'm a frustrated ham, and I love doing these cameos.  The only thing I don't understand is why they don't give me a featured role.  I think these cameos are just my auditions for the future movies.  And everyone, of course, enjoyed you in the great Kevin Smith film. 
[02:41:30]  Mallrats.  Can you tell us how you got involved with that?  Well, Kevin and I had gotten a little bit friendly.  And when he asked me to do it, I couldn't say no.  Although, to be very honest, even if we weren't friendly, I would have said yes.  And I couldn't believe he was giving me such a big role.  But luckily, I carried it off magnificently.  And I think I'm a jinx, though, because that was the only movie of Kevin's that I appeared in.  And it's the only one of his that didn't make any money, which worries me a little bit. 
[02:42:00]  Thanks so much, Stan.  It's great to be here with you today.  This is Stan Lee, co-creator of X-Men and Spider-Man.  And you are lucky enough to be listening to the Opie and Anthony show on X-Men Satellite Radio.  Shut up!  Do one more just to be safe?  Shut up!  This is Stan Lee, co-creator of Spider-Man and the X-Men.  And you are lucky enough to be listening to the Opie and Anthony show on X-Men Satellite Radio. 
[02:42:30]  Excellent.  Thank you.  At least you knew you did the idea, right?  Yeah, it was a good idea.  That was wonderful.  If it wasn't for you turning the volume up to 10.  Yeah, it was me.  Wow.  It was you.  Well, who did it?  Stan didn't hold the mic.  Well, I guess I should have taken a few more radio classes before I went out there.  Well, you don't have to be...  Radio classes?  An 8-year-old knows to look at meters.  How to work at that machine?  Yeah, okay.  That machine has meters, doesn't it? 
[02:43:00]  No.  It's got a little meter at the bottom.  Everyone's nodding.  Yes, it does.  All right.  All right.  Was it pegged?  It's all my fault.  It must have just been pegged in the red.  That's not your fault.  So what?  That's no big deal.  Machine did it.  I suck.  It's 2000.  It's not like we're going to play any of these IDs again, so don't worry about it.  How about the...  Thomas Jane.  Who?  I don't believe he got Thomas Jane.  We end with Thomas Jane.  Who's Thomas Jane?  Yeah, and I'm waiting for it to start.  Who's Thomas Jane?  He was in several films, including The Punisher, Deep Blue. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  That guy again.  That guy.  Ready?  Yeah.  This is Thomas Jane.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  This is Thomas Jane.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  This is Thomas Jane.  This is Thomas Jane.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  It just ends.  Why did it end? 
[02:44:00]  Why did that just stop?  When the DAT machine stops, it backs up when you start recording again.  So there were a lot of these on the end that it backed up and cut the end off.  Why do you use a DAT machine?  Because that's what I was given, Jim.  I don't know how to use a DAT machine.  Knowing what you were going to get, they should have gave you a reel-to-reel.  I don't know this DAT machine.  I don't know what it does.  Yes.  I can see the meters.  Thank you.  Excellent.  Oh, the meters.  He just brought...  Well, you said there wasn't...  Danny just brought in the actual DAT machine.  So according to Kev, there's no meters, and Adrian Brody's a big fan of the show. 
[02:44:30]  Are you pissed off they didn't give you better equipment?  No.  With what you were getting, they should have gave you a Thomas Edison creation with a big  fucking...  Where it burns into wax.  Right, exactly.  Why don't you get the booker to get some people there?  It's a...  Oh!  Oh!  Wow.  Good for you!  Oh!  Good for you!  Good for you, Kev.  Good for you.  You're going to take that?  Oh!  Wait, there was another one.  There was a longer one, which I'd like to hear.  Yeah.  You don't have enough time.  Why?  Because it's seven minutes. 
[02:45:00]  What is it?  No, which one?  It's ten.  We're on until 11.  Which one?  Oh, it's only ten.  Yeah.  The interview with the great...  The great...  Wilmer Valderrama.  Wilmer Valderrama.  What?  Who's he?  Yes.  He is from That 70s Show.  Oh.  He has a new movie coming out called El Muerto.  El Muerto.  Yes.  That's Spanish for the muerto.  I think it's Spanish for the crow.  Oh, it is?  No, but...  No, it's the dead, right?  Yeah.  I think it's Spanish for... 
[02:45:30]  Ugh.  It's Spanish for...  Yeah.  I'm in That 70s Show and have been typecast and will never do anything else of merit.  I'd like to hear this.  I think you guys are being negative.  I think this is going to be...  I'm being negative and I did it.  I think it's going to be interesting because Kev's interviews are usually good.  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Wilmer Valderrama from That 70s Show.  Is that a radio voice?  Oh, this is Big Kev.  Hello, wasn't it?  I couldn't hear.  I could be wrong.  This is Big Kev.  I think there's a radio voice going on there.  This is Big Kev.  I'm here with Wilmer Valderrama from That 70s Show. 
[02:46:00]  That 70s Show.  Oh, I'm hearing a little radio inflection.  That 70s Show.  Not That 70s Show from That 70s Show.  Why don't you tell us the inspiration for your character?  What do you think is the greatest way to...  How's that barrel fit?  Just great.  We got two furs coming up from...  I have furniture.  I have furniture coming into the barrel because I spend so much time in it.  Let's get the lead out. 
[02:46:30]  Let's get the egg out.  Yeah.  Breakout film called El Muerto.  Tell us a little bit about El Muerto.  El Muerto is a story about this young man who's used by the Aztec gods and sacrificed...  By the what?  By the Aztec gods to become this human weapon to execute three sacrifices in the name of the...  Sacrifice?  Yeah, the gods.  In order for them to rise up again and take vengeance against the Catholic people who slaughtered them when they were...  Did you ever lick Lindsay Lohan's asshole? 
[02:47:00]  Hmm?  Butterscotch Vilma?  Do we have to listen to the rest of the...  No, you don't.  It's great, dude.  Oh, come on.  Totally not.  Gotta hear some of Cat's question.  I really think you should not listen to it.  The question was good.  Uh, the answer, the answer was, uh, was rooting.  Come on.  They were in their own man.  Revenge against the Catholics, huh?  Well, I mean, but the funny thing about it is that it's, it's just, um...  The punny?  It's such an unspoken truth, you know, it's such a part of, of history, you know, uh, you know, according to the books, you know. 
[02:47:30]  And, and in this movie, you know, the, the needed thing about it is that, is that this character just so goes, this is, this happened so long ago.  This is just, you know, why am I fighting someone else's battle?  And he's, and he's, and he's probably the first hero ever to, to, uh, to mainly have his powers because of love.  You know, um, not because of some freak accent or anything, but really because he was brought back for a long time. 
[02:48:00]  But at the same time, you know, he was, you know, he was brought back, uh, by love, you know, and, and, and, and, and prayer.  Stop it!  And that's, uh, that's an interesting, uh, beautiful way to bring back, you know, a person that way.  Shut up!  It's kind of a, it's kind of a dark movie.  I've seen the trailer.  And, uh, it's, uh, it's, it's a, it's a little spooky.  There's going to be obvious comparisons to things like The Crow.  How do you answer, uh, things like that?  Well, it's completely different from The Crow.  I mean, look, I'm, I'm, I'm one of The Crow's biggest fans.  Hoo-hoo, he's ripping off The Crow. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, tell him, Fred.  Completely different.  Look at the movie poster.  It's, it's, it's.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  That's the same fucking character with your hair.  It's the same thing.  What an ass.  Oh, he must be, and you can hear in his voice, he was so pissed hearing that question again.  It's The Crow.  Look at the poster.  It's completely different from The Crow.  We use blanks.  Wow.  Wow.  Hey, that was a terrific interview.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's not over.  Come on.  Obi, there's more.  Come on.  I'm really with you. 
[02:49:00]  There's over five minutes left of this.  I want to hear his response.  This guy's great.  I'll start by saying that, you know, but what's different about this movie is that, is that,  first of all, it goes back to the Egyptians, you know.  Ah.  There's been stories, you know, there's been stories, you know, for decades and decades and decades of, you know, beings bring back to life, you know, and superheroes, you know, bring back to life, you know, for certain tasks, you know.  And this one uses an amazing drop, which is the Mexican holiday, which is the Mexican holiday, which is the celebration of the dead. 
[02:49:30]  And that celebration of the dead is basically the time where you have, you know, when you have your loved ones, you know, in prayers, bring back your soul to earth, you know, to spend, you know, this evening with you every year, you know.  And it's a beautiful, it's a beautiful message, you know, I mean, it's the only time during the year where, where there's one day, you know, parents or brothers and sisters or, you know, daughters. 
[02:50:00]  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Mom, please stop calling me.  Mom, I'm not going to work.  I have to do this now.  He's kept with his tapes.  Mom.  Mom.  Wow, that was, I don't think we'd come back from that.  I just. 
[02:50:30]  That's wonderful.  Come on.  I saw the Superman trailer.  Oh.  It didn't entirely suck.  Okay.  What happened in the trailer?  Nothing.  I would like to know.  No, no, it's okay.  The reason I got dead silence is because you didn't say anything about the movie.  Let's see, Sean from Old Bridge.  I'm getting from this interview that El Muerto is Spanish for, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep. 
[02:51:00]  His career is El Muerto.  That was, well, that was good.  3,000 miles.  Actually, 6,000 if you count the trip back.  But it is true.  Big Kevin gets bigger celebrities than our.  That is true.  Than our talent booker.  That's true.  Okay, great.  Hey, wait.  I do want to know about the Superman trailer.  How are the effects?  You know.  What?  Nothing.  I'd like to.  Oh!  Big Kevin's really mad.  Uh-oh. 
[02:51:30]  What, Big Kevin?  Go ahead, Big Kevin.  The floor is yours.  That's right.  You complain all the time about this booker.  And, and.  I said you get bigger.  You think I was kidding?  You get bigger guests than our booker.  That is the truth.  Okay.  That is, that was actually not a slam.  Okay.  We'll just leave it at that.  That was my way of twisting it to make it look like you're doing something for the program.  Yeah.  Thanks.  So now, Kev, what are you, Kev is annoyed.  Kev, what are you trying to say?  Just say it.  Yeah.  I'm saying that.  Speak your mind, Kev. 
[02:52:00]  I'm saying that I could do the job better than the booker.  That's what I'm saying.  Hmm.  Who would you get on the show tomorrow, if you could?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow's a little short notice.  Right.  Why don't you give me some credentials and some time and why don't you see who I could get on the show?  First guest.  I don't know.  Who do you want?  Anybody.  That's not anybody.  I love the lists we've been getting sent.  I want, um.  That's great.  Believe, believe it or not, I'd like Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn. 
[02:52:30]  Number one movie in the, in the country.  Wedding Crashers.  Or how about this?  See, but I can't say, you know, that I represent the show or I represent XM because then people get in trouble.  They get angry.  Or I can't go to a studio executive or a studio PR person and say, here's who I am and here's what I'm trying to do because then people get in trouble.  How about this suggestion?  How about, how much time would it take you, do you think, to get a good guest in here?  Well, what are you qualifying as a good guest?  Well, by the end of this week. 
[02:53:00]  That's a week.  That's including.  By the end of this week?  Yeah.  How about by the end of next week?  Yeah.  All right.  If you could bring in, how about you get like.  In studio or calling?  In studio.  How about you get like Clarice Starling, the FBI that expires.  You're not real FBI.  How about this?  For now until that date, you are able to say I represent the O.P. Anthony program.  You don't have to give them the expiration date on the credentials.  And it's kind of like a pseudo audition. 
[02:53:30]  Oh.  To see who you can bring in.  Who you dredge up.  Fine.  We have to wait a week and a half.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  It doesn't happen overnight.  It's a process and it's a long and drawn out process and things are booked months in advance.  If I'm able to get anyone in here in two weeks, I would be astonished myself.  But I'll at least give it a try.  Well, we're on air.  I think that's a good suggestion.  But if you're going to be our booker, why are you going to be astonished if you can find someone in two weeks? 
[02:54:00]  Because of what I just said, O.P.  It's booked months in advance.  They know their schedule.  Not all of them are booked months in advance.  Not all of them.  Okay.  We'll even take a phone call from someone big.  Phone calls are much easier to do than in studio.  Let's do a phoner.  I will do a phoner, but I would prefer to still get someone in studio because, again, there's enough celebrities in New York.  They're all going over to Sirius.  All of them go over there.  They do the radio chick.  They do every fucking show at Sirius, so they're in New York.  They're not people that are out of New York.  They go through one, one, one.  They do every show because somebody over there is getting them in. 
[02:54:30]  Did you see the lists that we get emailed to us, and we check off the ones we want, and then you never hear another thing about it?  Yeah.  I get lists.  I'm like, okay, Steve Buscemi.  I'd love to have Steve Buscemi on the show.  Check that one off.  And then I send it back, and you never hear anything.  Steve Buscemi's, you know, movie what?  Is it out?  Which one?  I don't know.  That's just it.  And then all of a sudden, I hear nothing about it.  The guests never come in. 
[02:55:00]  But let me ask you this.  They certainly don't make it easy to work for XM.  No, they don't.  Is the booker for this show the booker only for this show?  No.  I don't know.  We met her once.  She's talked in a funny accent, and that's all I know.  That's the problem.  We haven't seen her since.  She has no idea about the show.  She doesn't know what guests are appropriate.  I questioned her on one of the guests that was supposed to call our show and didn't, and she came up with this whacked out thing that his cell phone wasn't working.  And I wrote her back.  I said, are you really buying that?  And she goes, yes, he's a good friend.  She got all.  She got all in my face about it. 
[02:55:30]  And I'm like, all right, that's it.  Pissy.  That's it.  Done.  Done with them.  Pissy.  Not saying I'm friends with anybody or I have better connections than anybody.  That was the Vin Diesel thing, right?  Yeah.  We were promoting it, and he didn't call because he couldn't get cell phone service near Teterboro Airport.  And that's the excuse she used, so I wrote her personally.  I'm like.  That's a lie.  I'm like, you're not buying this, are you?  I'm like, we weren't born yesterday.  At least tell us that he blew us off for whatever reason.  But don't say that it was a bad cell phone.  She goes, well, actually, I do believe it because I have a good relationship with, you know, his publicist, and how dare you. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, don't you question.  Yeah, don't question what I'm saying.  Well, did he ever call back, or did he never get cell phone reception again anywhere?  That's right.  That's right, Jimmy.  Where was he traveling to?  Fucking Jupiter?  And why would you not get cell phone reception near Teterboro Airport?  Well, that could have happened once.  That's an acceptable thing.  It happens everywhere.  Even in New York, on 6th, everywhere they get dropped.  But then to not call in, that's the problem.  Right.  If he calls on the next day and goes, hey, sorry, guys.  Okay.  We're not a priority.  Someday we'll be a priority.  Someday. 
[02:56:30]  What do you mean?  You don't think that they're pushing to get people?  Nah.  I would.  I don't think XM pushes to get celebrities on this show that they have coming through Washington  and our booker that they actually pay a lot of money for.  They're not pushing this show at all.  No.  Never.  No.  It's certainly not.  You know, we have Major League Baseball.  We have the All-Star Game, and we can't get one baseball player.  One baseball player.  But the bosses want us.  One.  But the bosses want us to have more celebrities on the show.  That's one of their goals.  Hello.  That's one XM could have controlled, and we couldn't get one? 
[02:57:00]  I say fuck them.  So.  All right, Kev.  People seem to enjoy the show.  Fuck the guests.  Well, we do it our way.  It just makes it hard.  That's all.  I can do it.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to do this, then.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the only name violence.  I don't know.  You know what?  Why don't we just move right to Wang Chong?  All right.  Wang Chong.  Everybody have fun tonight.  We all remember this.  What a big, fun hit this was. 
[02:57:30]  Everybody have fun tonight.  Took forever.  Everybody have fun tonight.  Everybody Wang Chong tonight.  Everybody have fun tonight.  There you go.  Have fun, Wang Chong.  Everybody Wang Chong.  What does that mean, though?  Has anyone ever figured that out?  It means having fun.  Wang Chong.  I think Wang is a euphemism for sodomize, and Chong was maybe a retarded boy they knew in the neighborhood. 
[02:58:00]  That was the idea.  Everybody Wang Chong tonight.  We're all going to Wang Chong.  Everyone have butt sex with a retard.  Poor Chong.  I never thought of it that way.  I just want his friends to come over and hug him and talk to him.  Then he'd wind up face first crying into a Cookie Monster pillow.  What's the matter, Chong?  They Wang me.  Oh, he doesn't know what he's talking about.  Who Wang you?  Everybody.  And they have fun doing it. 
[02:58:30]  Old Bloody Bottom.  Chung throws a punch when he takes it in the ass.  He's been on vacation.  Across the nation, around the world.  Everybody Wang Chong tonight.  Some guy even drove a million miles to fuck that tempting bottom.  Didn't even keep it a secret.  Spread the word.  Everybody Wang Chong tonight.  Oh, there's a line of cars like at the end of Field of Dreams. 
[02:59:00]  Old Lady put it in his short tookus.  Jesus.  We're actually laughing at this.  Oh, poor innocent bottom.  Little Chung.  Oh, he's just confused.  He wants friends.  Sheepish dope.  Kirby and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[02:59:30]  Nice.  All right, guys.  Rock.  Spreading the virus across America.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:00:00]  Hello.  Mike wants to correct me, actually.  Why?  Mike in New Jersey.  Mike.  Hey.  Hey.  First of all,  Wedding Crashers is not the number one movie  in a matter of when the chocolate factory is.  Ah, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  It's $55 million or something like that.  I'm sorry.  I thought the number one movie was going to be that Penguin movie.  I was shocked and amazed that it was actually Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Charlie.  What Penguin movie?  Hey, Jimmy.  What kind of Yankee fan are you? 
[03:00:30]  What's the matter with you?  The Yankees are kicking ass right now.  You should be supporting them.  I'll tell you why, dude.  Because I'm not just about the Yankees winning.  I love the way the Yankees built that team from a young team.  And I liked what Gene Michael did when Steinbrenner wasn't in baseball.  And what happened to them is they just started buying big players.  Guys that I hated.  I love the Yankees.  I don't just want to win.  I don't want to beat them with guys that I've always hated and continually try to do that.  I'm sick and tired of the way they're doing things.  That's why.  All right.  I understand that, but...  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, I actually hate when they list the top movies of the weekend or whatever because  it's like...  It's obviously going to be the ones most advertised.  Yeah.  You know?  The Penguin movie, Anthony.  Penguin movie?  Yeah, the Daily News did a little article, Best of 2005.  The films so far, the Best of 2005.  And my favorite movie of 05, according to Jack Matthews, so far, is a documentary about  penguins that was made by a French film crew in the Antarctic.  Are you kidding me?  This guy's favorite movie was a penguin documentary? 
[03:01:30]  It's doing gang-up business on the art house circuit, but no amount of cute penguins can  reverse the box office slump.  Yeah.  I don't think the Penguin movie is going to pull it out of the slump.  The movie is called March of the Penguins.  March of the Penguins.  And it leads his top ten list, Anthony.  They show it in my...  This guy must be a bore.  This guy must just be a bore.  It's getting rave reviews.  Of course it is.  How do you give a bad review to a Penguin documentary?  RottenTomatoes.com has given it 93% positive reviews. 
[03:02:00]  Because of what it is...  Also known as a fresh tomato.  It's going to get a good review just because of what it is.  That's like an easy thing.  What review is going to go, I hated it.  Those penguins weren't adorable.  They're penguins.  They waddle when they want.  Can I read some of the reviews of the movie before you make your judgment?  Let me hear a review.  They have two colors.  Yeah.  Black, white.  Tiger Woods' house.  What is wrong with you? 
[03:02:30]  The madman.  Ixnay on the...  Hey, how you doing, man?  I like that, actually.  That's a great get-up.  Oh, yeah.  That was hilarious.  That's a great get-up.  We forget that you actually wear the uniform in every so often.  Every so often when you're...  I'm going out of your neighborhood.  You don't have to say, but...  Detail here in New York?  A little OT?  No?  Just they put you here?  Security?  Homeland security? 
[03:03:00]  Maybe subway?  You don't have to arrest your friends, do you?  No.  Can you imagine?  He's got to arrest his friends.  Guys, this is no bit.  I'm taking you in.  Subways?  Yeah, could be.  All right.  Kit Kat Club?  Kit Kat Club.  Kit Kat Club.  Beautiful girls?  Couple Arabs smuggling bums.  All right, Anthony.  I got the reviews for the Penguin documentary, okay?  It's called...  What was it called again?  March of the Penguins?  March of the Penguins, right?  March of the Penguins.  Okay.  Love a man in uniform.  Joe Leiden, Leiden from Variety.com says about the movie... 
[03:03:30]  Yes.  The spirit-lifting finale will delight audiences hardy enough to brave the journey.  Okay, what?  What was...  I guess there's a...  I missed that.  Why?  I guess there's a big finale to the movie.  What?  Hardy enough to...  A finale?  Yeah.  You'll never look at the Penguins in Madagascar quite the same way again, says Willie Weffel.  That's a joke.  From Weffelmovies.com. 
[03:04:00]  No one's ever looked at them in any way, any how, any time.  How can I...  Right now, I look at them, and I want to hit their stomachs with a bat.  How will I look at them differently when this is over?  I want to double them over.  Well, let's try.  Can you double over a penguin?  I don't know.  Can you double over?  A stiff oval.  I want to see if it can bend over after a bat slams into its little adorable stomach.  A little soft belly.  A little furry belly.  And aborts little penguins by accident.  This is truly a great film.  What makes it a great film is its emotional impact. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  And this is europeanfilms.net about March of the Penguins,  the inventive use of well-written and acted voiceovers,  and the technical sleekness of this work makes one hungry for more.  You know what my favorite scene in this movie's going to be?  The guy with the riding mower who rides through the penguin colony.  And all you see is little kicking feet.  Blood and black and white fur with blood all over it.  Just flying out of the little exhaust part of the mower. 
[03:05:00]  They're confused.  They don't know what it is.  They just know it's killing their young.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  The Charlotte Observer writes,  I decided long ago that I needed no further proof that animals have souls,  but if I didn't need some, I could find it in March of the Penguins.  What is this man doing?  He's riding with a long...  Oh, my God!  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Nice.  Let's see. 
[03:05:30]  March of the Penguins.  All right.  Well, let's go with the cream of the crop.  There's more drama and more heartbreak in March of the Penguins  than in most movies that are actually scripted to tug at our feelings.  Yeah.  There's the one penguin sitting on the little piece of ice,  and the other penguin just can't hang on,  so it lets go and drowns.  I like to lay a penguin on its side,  and then soccer ball kick it right in its little penguin belly,  right up against a wall.  Wah! 
[03:06:00]  You know what I like to do to a penguin?  You grab it by the neck, and you put a finger into it.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Then you put it into the fingers.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  And you put a crucifix around it,  and it hits your knuckles with a ruler.  Shitty little animals.  There's no way it could get a bad review, is what I'm saying.  It's one of those movies that it's impossible to give a bad review to.  Well. 
[03:06:30]  All right, well, there you go.  March of the Penguins, the top movie of the year so far,  according to Jack Matthews,  with five reviews on RottenTomatoes.com.  Trying to find one more for you guys.  They walk upright, little creeps.  What are you?  You're a bird or a person.  I can't fly.  Make a decision.  With their little tuxedos.  Their little useless wings.  Yeah, just flapping around.  They can't even grab shit.  No.  I like to put a big rig of gas around those penguins  and set it on fire,  and watch them whack-whack that way through it. 
[03:07:00]  Thinking, I have wings, yet I cannot fly over this fire.  Guys, I got another review if you'd like to hear it.  Right.  All right.  Except for the part where sometimes leopard seals eat them,  penguins are just like you and me.  Stop it.  Another penguin pissing out of a penguin's face.  It is like Jimmy.  Yeah, they picture a penguin laying on its back,  jerking off with its head on a glad bag.  I was going to say that, just like Owen Wilson,  licking ass, butterscotch penguin.  Yeah, of course.  Those little Percy beaks, 
[03:07:30]  rotten forward-combed hair.  So I guess there's some,  I guess that's the heartbreak of it,  is when they're getting eaten by the lion seals.  That's the best part.  Leopard seals just eating their little fat fuckers.  Let me, uh, let me.  Full of blubber and deliciousness.  Eating them alive.  Sharp teeth and that little body.  Oh.  Yeah, you know they don't, like,  painfully put them out of their misery  and then eat them.  And that.  They're just half of penguins  on the ice,  just full of blood.  And that little cute shit  doesn't work with the leopard seal.  He's hungry.  Wah, wah, wah.  Fuck you. 
[03:08:00]  That is so funny to see him in his little suit.  Uh, who did I thought I'd ever be funny?  No one has ever been funny.  Hey, did it get all good reviews?  I'm trying to read the ones  that don't have big words.  I'm seeing one that,  did it get a bad review somewhere?  Um, I can't really find a bad review.  It doesn't have 100%.  Oh, here we go.  So there's got to be a bad one.  For the emperor penguin,  celibacy is not an option.  Yeah, that's the review.  What the hell does that mean? 
[03:08:30]  I don't know.  Still a chock full of penguin pussy.  Uh, you'll learn, quite frankly,  that penguins have a really tough life.  I thought they were just like you and me.  It's just penguins.  Penguins are just like you and me.  Uh, alright, well.  Who is the, who is his wah, wah?  Yes, kids, we're talking penguin sex.  How awesome is that?  Oh, I'd like to check out penguin sex.  Really?  Why not?  How can they tell if they're fucking a male or a female? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  You're just going to put it in a hole,  and if you hear, ooh, you know what's right,  and if you hear, ah, wah, wah, wah.  Move on to the next one.  Just like real life.  Yeah, you just look for a hole that lets you in.  Ah, ah, ah.  I don't think Anthony knows the question,  the answer to this question, Kristen.  Kristen?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Uh, I wanted to ask Professor Anthony if he knew how penguins have sex,  because they don't have arms or hands.  Interesting.  I would think like any other bird. 
[03:09:30]  I don't, I don't know how,  I would think he puts his little penguin dick in her penguin pussy.  Ha ha, you don't know something.  Yeah, I don't.  All right, thanks, guys.  Find it out.  Never professed to know everything.  I know, but it's fun when you don't know something.  I don't know that.  Because then, then you're just like Jimmy and I.  Just like a penguin.  Ah, Keith in New York, what's up?  Hey, guys, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey.  I actually took my fiancé to see that movie,  and it was actually very well put together, 
[03:10:00]  and Morgan Freeman did a good job narrating it.  Pretty much kept it interesting the whole time.  Morgan Freeman narrates it?  Hey, Jimmy.  Must have been fascinating.  I wanted to tell you, last time we talked,  you asked me why I liked the cream pies.  Yeah.  And I figured out, you asked me if,  because I told you that my girlfriend,  I told you that the only sex,  the only videos I like are the cream pie videos  from black guys doing fat white girls, 
[03:10:30]  and you asked me if, like, my mother was fat or something,  and I didn't even think about it,  but, like, my girlfriend used to date a black guy.  Who was it?  I don't know.  They call you during the show?  Why are they calling you during the show?  I honestly don't know.  But did they say hi?  I heard the answer.  No, maybe they didn't know I picked up.  Oh, all right.  What did you say, sir?  Yeah, great, great story, dude.  Do you like that?  Keith in New York.  What's up?  Did you get that?  No.  What?  Last time Jimmy and I talked,  I was telling him that the only porn I like  are those cream pie videos. 
[03:11:00]  Who's calling you during the show?  I'm not sure.  Did I lose you guys?  No.  Oh, okay.  What are you doing?  Hurry up.  Continue your story.  No, so Jimmy was asking me, you know,  like, what it was that was motivating me  to like that kind of thing,  and I didn't even think about it,  and I realized it's because my girlfriend  was a black guy.  But they just called you.  Maybe it was a telemarketer.  Nah, now it was a 6-4-6-7,  but it might have been someone.  So now every time I look at porn,  all I look at the black guys doing fat white girls.  I don't know what that's all about.  Oh, really?  Steve C?  Because he was teaching me  how to boot up an iPod. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, very nice.  I need to know how to do screen caps  off of a DVD.  I keep getting a black screen.  I want to download a ringtone.  It piss me off.  All right, punch it out.  Okay, go ahead.  Oh.  What a bore-fest that guy was.  Here's how to do it.  Oh.  Put the whole switch  onto the on position,  then back to the off.  Then back to the off.  Put the whole switch  onto the on position.  Guys, I bet you would like to know  some of the other films  that Jack Matthews thinks  are the best of 2005. 
[03:12:00]  Well, if that's his number one pick,  I can only imagine  what the rest are.  Usually we like to work our way to the top,  but we did it a little differently this time.  In 10th place,  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Oh, giant piece of shit.  I didn't see it.  Haven't seen it.  Big Kev's calling it  a giant piece of shit.  Yes, sir.  And again.  Then we got Hitch.  Long Rouge.  We got Hitch.  The Will Smith vehicle.  Oh.  This is the best films?  This guy likes Hitch.  They like to call them vehicles  in Hollywood. 
[03:12:30]  This is a Will Smith vehicle.  Vehicle.  Vehicle.  Yeah, I like the Jane Mansfield vehicle better.  Then we got Cinderella Man.  Ah, yes.  Russell Crowe.  It got great reviews,  but no one went to see it,  and then they started offering refunds  if you didn't like the movie,  and then people still didn't go.  No.  So you could even fake it.  You could have went and saw a free movie,  and people still didn't take them up on it.  You probably had to mail something in for a refund.  And 7th place,  a movie I saw and I enjoyed,  Murderball,  and we're going to get  a couple of the stars of that movie  on the show soon. 
[03:13:00]  We are.  We are?  Yes.  Sure.  That was a great...  Did you see Murderball?  Yeah.  Did you like?  Yeah.  Be honest, yeah?  It was awesome, yeah.  Wasn't it amazing?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  We talked about it a little bit  on the show last week.  6th place,  George Romero's Land of the Dead.  Huh.  You like that?  The best zombie movie ever.  Stuff.  And the bleakest look yet  at American Life  after the death  of the middle class.  Did anyone see that one?  I did.  Of course you did.  I saw every movie ever, ever, ever. 
[03:13:30]  How many movies do you see a week?  Three or four.  Jesus.  Do you like most of them?  No.  I don't care.  No.  I know you don't care.  5th place,  Batman Begins.  Very dark.  I like that one.  That's good.  I didn't see that.  4th place,  a film called Millions?  Millions.  Yeah, that was a good movie.  Millions.  Jesus.  British films.  What's that about?  How many guests  marched through Sirius  as opposed to here?  No.  Well, I'll tell you  what the plot of the movie is, Jimmy.  It's Opie's bank account. 
[03:14:00]  Millions.  British charmer  about two boys  trying to figure out  what to do with a fortune  and found cash  abandoned by train robbers.  They discuss it under a porch.  And I'll buy candy.  And cake.  All right.  And 3rd place,  according to Jack Matthews,  the best films of 2005 so far,  a little movie called Crash.  Ah, right, right.  I like Crash as well.  And 2nd place, Sin City.  That was good, too.  I like Sin City. 
[03:14:30]  But he put the Penguin movie  on top of everything.  Over Sin City, wow.  What a faggot.  All right.  I'm actually writing a comedy  about a penguin.  Really?  Yep.  It's, uh,  I don't want to give it away,  but it's about a family  that adopts a penguin,  and they put it in the corner,  and they chain it up,  and they don't feed it,  they just slap it.  That sounds great. 
[03:15:00]  They ask you questions in English,  and whenever it goes wah-wah,  they hit it.  People are calling you out  on the quacking penguin, Jimmy.  I understand.  I don't care.  I'm reading instant feedbacks going,  penguins quacking, Jimmy?  Exactly.  I shouldn't know what noises they make.  You have no idea.  A penguin could call me right now,  and I wouldn't know what it was.  You know why?  Because I don't watch shows  about penguins.  I watch films about trannies and logs.  Where's this postmark for murder?  Do we have this audio somewhere?  That would be hilarious. 
[03:15:30]  I enjoy documentaries,  but usually they're war documentaries and stuff.  I was watching some Hitler thing  on the Hitler Channel  over the weekend.  On the Hitler Channel?  Yeah.  It's got a big H in the corner,  in the lower corner.  I assumed it stands for Hitler,  because every show involves Hitler.  And they were showing, of course,  again, concentration camps  and ditches just full of dead people.  And they put close-up,  I mean, close-up shots  of dead people  with their mouths open,  all contorted.  And why is that fine to show? 
[03:16:00]  Why is that fine,  but you can't show, like,  modern footage?  for an eighth of a second.  Yeah.  Or even, like,  footage from Iraq  and show that.  It's really graphic.  Or you could show tits.  If there's nude women...  Dead tits.  You could show dead women  in a ditch.  Dude, tits?  I saw a dead snatch  on this show.  They had women  laying in the trenches,  dead,  just completely like their...  Their thigh bone  just covered with skin  is pretty much what it is.  And you're just seeing,  like, nudity. 
[03:16:30]  But if you showed that  on a living human being,  you get in trouble.  And the excuse is,  well, one is to titillate,  one is not.  But it's like,  why would one be considered bad?  Why is titillating bad  and showing you something  in this horrible situation?  We're all messed up.  Really?  It's true.  I was actually thinking  about this point this morning.  You know,  I watch the news  as soon as I wake up,  try to start getting  prepared for the show.  And they pretty much  showed the whole  Jessica Simpson video.  Yeah.  And I don't even think  it was on MTV.  I think they were doing  some kind of story  or something.  I don't know what gets written.  It's one of the hottest videos 
[03:17:00]  of the last ten years.  Absolutely.  And why, I mean,  granted,  I think everyone knows  where we're coming from  at this point.  We think you should show everything.  But why,  if you're going to start  making rules,  that's okay,  but Janet Jackson's  boo for a sixteenth  of a second isn't.  It was the most unsexy,  untitillating thing ever,  Janet Jackson.  And most of it was still  covered with some kind  of jewelry and stuff.  It was covered with jewelry.  It just flopped out a second.  But yeah.  The Jessica Simpson video.  Jessica Simpson video  is hot the whole way through. 
[03:17:30]  It is meant to be hot.  There's no other value to it  but to be hot.  I was this close  to whacking off the story.  To just scrapping one?  I'm not even kidding.  I was like,  I gotta whack off.  Yeah.  She looks unbelievable  in that video.  It is unbelievable  how hot that video is.  And she's just wearing  nothing but a bikini,  washing a car.  Right.  She's got wet.  She's soapy.  And that's made  purely to titillate.  Yeah.  Of course.  The rules are ridiculous.  There are no real rules. 
[03:18:00]  It's stupid.  Let's go to Seamus  in Brooklyn.  Seamus.  Yeah.  Seamus.  I watched that thing  on the History Channel also.  Yeah.  It wasn't only dead people.  They had,  when they were putting them  in the gas chambers,  you had alive people.  You see their emaciated  ball bags and scrotums  hanging out.  Yeah, they had guys  walking in,  taking their clothes off  and you're seeing  yam bag and dick.  And notice that.  But we like to keep  the show to hotness.  Oh.  Keep it all to myself.  Alright, thank you. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, look.  Yeah.  I don't know why  I watch those shows  because there's not going  to be any new information,  that's for sure.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  It passed.  Aw.  But what?  You made us all look.  I'm sorry.  Did I ruin it?  No.  What?  Jimmy?  It was just something  that said Bitter Ant.  That was the name  of the product.  I was just thinking  that thing because...  Maybe when I'm all bitter?  Yeah, but it just  doesn't hold on.  What noises do penguins  make, by the way?  I don't know.  I think it's some kind  of squeak, though. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, I think it's more  like a squeaky noise.  I think it's more  of a squeaky noise.  More toward a pig  than a duck.  Well, that's why...  No.  Like, more like a tweet,  but not a tweet.  Like a squeak.  Tweet like a bird?  Yeah, sort of,  but a little more  than just a tweet.  Like, they don't go...  Would you say  it's kind of a tweet-oink?  No, it's more  like a squeak.  Really?  Like a...  Kind of a squeak.  That's kind of  like what I was doing.  You were going quack,  quack.  You were doing  Burgess Meredith. 
[03:19:30]  That's the noise  they make.  Burgess Meredith.  Does it sound  like a puppy?  Uh, oh yeah,  maybe a little like that.  Yeah, like a squeaky thing.  Oh, here's the video now.  Thank you.  Ridiculous this is.  Thank you, Eric,  for totally ruining  the show,  taking us right out of it.  What video?  You haven't seen  the Jessica Simpson video yet?  I don't even know  what the song is.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, by the way, yeah,  I watched it  without even the sound on.  You don't need the sound.  You don't need the sound.  I'm drooling on myself. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  The Dan Band.  What?  We've been meaning  to get to the Dan Band.  What is that?  Oh, there it is.  Listen to the Dan Band  for a second  as we look at  Jessica Simpson.  That was for  Jesus Christ.  Every now and then  I get a little bit lonely  and you're never coming round.  Every now and then  I get a little bit tired  of listening  to the sound of my tears. 
[03:20:30]  Every now and then  I get a little bit nervous  that the best of all  my years have gone by.  Every...  Turn around, Jimmy.  Wait, I was enjoying that.  Yeah.  Opie, what are you...  And I need you  more than ever.  Ugh.  Turn around,  turn around.  Fucking every now  and then I fall apart.  And I need you  now tonight.  I fucking need you  more than ever. 
[03:21:00]  If you'll only hold me tight.  We'll be holding on forever.  And we'll only  for making it right.  Cause we'll never be wrong.  Together we can take it  to the end of the line.  Your love is like a shadow  on me all the time.  Shit, I don't know what to do.  We're always in the dark.  Living in a public gig  and giving up fucks.  I really need you tonight. 
[03:21:30]  Before ever's gonna start tonight.  The fucking ever's gonna start too.  Once upon a...  We're trying to do...  Curse words?  Yeah, that was from that movie.  Old school?  No.  Which movie did the Dan band?  I think it was.  Right?  When they're saying  adding fuck to the word.  It was the wedding band, right?  Yeah.  I'm married in the beginning.  We're trying to do a bit here  but this Jessica Simpson video  is ridiculous.  I knew.  The second Eric put it up there  we're not gonna pay attention  to anything.  Britney Spears is so done. 
[03:22:00]  Cause she's doing  the Britney Spears thing.  But so much better.  Britney Spears...  I bet you Britney Spears  wants to throw herself  out of a window.  That bikini's flattering  on her.  I would say that.  I think she needs to be  flattering.  Showcase her figure?  Yeah.  She's got an attractive figure.  I think she should get  one of those  old lady bathing suits.  See if she can work that.  Then we'll see  how hot she really is.  That is god damn ridiculous.  With the little  old lady skirt.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  The skirt that goes  over the bathing suit.  See that would be the bit.  Hide the hurt.  If SNL was actually  creative  you'd take that video  and you'd do it  with an old lady bathing suit.  There.  There's a bit for SNL.  Run with it.  I think she'd look good  even in one of those.  As long as it didn't have  the skirt.  But if you had the  like a tight one piece  maybe that showed off  her meat flaps.  That's the bit.  Get Jessica Simpson  on SNL  to do the same video  in an old lady  bathing suit  with a skirt. 
[03:23:00]  Oh a couple of  still pictures.  Yeah that's great air.  Or maybe to have her  do it while she has  food poisoning  so she's vomiting  and shitting  all over the car.  Look at these  still shots.  They got still pictures  of her in their bikini.  Let me see one.  It's ridiculous.  Paving suit  needs some  butterscotch on it.  Let's say hi  to Steve McQueen.  Steve McQueen?  I wonder if you guys  saw the making  of that Jessica Simpson  video.  Did not. 
[03:23:30]  Well it's  pretty sick.  Her father  who I guess  is her agent  or whatever  is sitting there  right on the set  not more than  ten feet away  while she's  you know  going through  all these gyrations  and soaping up  the General Lee  he's got a big  grin on his face  and he's making  comments about her  body and like  hey look how hot  she is  you know  you know where  she got that  body from  and it was just  I mean this guy  is  Imagine being the  father of Jessica  Simpson  you just sit around  all day and go  yeah I made that  that's creepy  that's my creation  I say that while  I was fucking her  can we try to 
[03:24:00]  find that audio  that sounds like  something we would  enjoy on the show  Larry and W.Y.  wherever that is  Wyoming  Wyoming  Larry  I just wanted  to let Jimmy know  that not only  do penguins  not quack  they also  don't have fur  they do so  thank you sir  let's go to 
[03:24:30]  Georgia boy  Georgia boy  yes sir  y'all doing  alright this morning  we're having  a good time  that's good  I want to let  y'all know  that penguins  sound exactly  like Pat  from Winocchi  do they  later  he might be  right  they also  have rosacea  little red faces  that you want  to smack  with crystal  in your hand  their toes  are falling off  as they walk  on the ice  what are you  going to do  raven  raven  or raven  from florida  what's up  it's raven
