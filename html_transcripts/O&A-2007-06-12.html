<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with the hosts’ usual banter, marked by Jimmy’s professed illness and disgusted reaction to a David Chase interview.  They teased listener emails attempting to decipher the ending of *The Sopranos*, engaging in playful, repetitive arguments about the theories.  This was followed by a chaotic "Rock Scream Tuesday" segment featuring loud sound effects.  Paris Hilton's jail sentence was discussed, including a purported exclusive phone call with Barbara Walters,  with the hosts employing crude humor in their speculation.  Jimmy’s various ailments, including a rash, were graphically described throughout the broadcast.

E-Rock's recent tanning experience became fodder for jokes about his appearance.  A significant portion of the show focused on a supposedly explosive “limo incident” resulting in Vince McMahon’s perceived death—revealed to be a staged WWE event—leading to humorous speculation from the hosts and a guest caller, Taz, a professional wrestler.  Anthony shared highly graphic details of his childhood memories involving his mother’s sexual encounters with her then-boyfriend and subsequent dating of a minor league baseball player.  The show mentioned Adam Ferraro and Carlos Mencia as scheduled guests and promoted a Father’s Day giveaway: a trip to the Bunny Ranch.

Further discussion of Vince McMahon's staged "death" involved analysis of the video footage, revealing inconsistencies such as a fake leg, and playful accusations of Taz's involvement.  The conversation shifted to Taz's agent and the challenges of the talent agency business, segueing into promotions for Opie and Anthony's upcoming Jones Beach event.  A shower cam feed of Red Room, a PalTalk personality, was shown, followed by comments on Jim Norton's girlfriend and living situation.

The show returned to lengthy, humorous analysis of *The Sopranos* ending, fueled by listener emails and multiple interpretations of the final scene's sound effects and music. Audio clips from the show were played and analyzed, with callers offering their own theories and details.  The debate remained unresolved.

The show opened another segment by discussing construction workers facing prison for overcharging, before pivoting to a Father's Day contest featuring a trip to the Bunny Ranch. Dennis Hoff, the Bunny Ranch owner, participated via phone.  Further debate over *The Sopranos* ending involved listener theories about wardrobe discrepancies in promotional photos, including a claim of inside information from a boom operator (later dismissed).  The Bunny Ranch contest dominated the segment, with callers sharing stories – including Johnny from Brooklyn, facing assault charges, and "Bear," the front runner, despite his wife's apathy.  Hoff detailed the VIP experience.  A past negative experience of a Bunny Ranch employee during a previous show appearance was mentioned.

In-studio guest Adam Ferraro discussed *Rescue Me*, joked about his on-screen persona, and recounted awkward real-life encounters related to his TV appearances.  The hosts teased a disastrous voiceover audition tape for the next day. The show concluded with a news story about a doctor dressed as Captain America, arrested for alleged groping and marijuana possession.

[00:00:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you for listening. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wake up.  Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up Trish, wake up Trish, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. 
[00:05:00]  Right off the bat on Pal Talk, why is Jimmy disgusted?  I have the camera on Jimmy, and Jimmy's not disgusted.  No, I'm actually feeling a bit under the weather. 
[00:05:30]  Oh no.  What is going on?  Aren't we all under the weather?  Well no, technically we're a part of it.  He's not disgusted?  No, I'm reading a David Chase interview, maybe I have a disgusted face.  Oh, hey man, I got the email overnight that explains the final episode of The Sopranos, okay?  Yeah, and then it's been...  I was privy.  I was the only one.  It's been debunked. 
[00:06:00]  It has not been.  It's been debunked.  It has not been.  It's been debunked.  It has not been.  It's been debunked.  It has not been.  It's been debunked.  Who sent it?  I just wanted to keep doing that for three hours.  Oh, some dude from Columbus, Ohio, I don't know.  I know him.  Yeah.  And I'll tease it.  I'll give you...  I'll explain the ending to The Sopranos in about 40 minutes or so.  Wow, you're going to explain the whole thing.  Oh yeah, it makes perfect sense.  Kind of wrap it up in a nice little bow, like everyone wanted.  It makes perfect sense.  Perfect sense now, because yesterday, it made no sense. 
[00:06:30]  Well now it makes sense, and I say David Chase is brilliant!  See, now you're going to have to stick around for the email I got.  And only I got.  Well, I have to stick around anyway.  Oh yeah.  Unfortunately.  I'm part of the show.  Hey.  Oh, well, sorry.  That was my brain.  Jeez.  Sometimes filter it before that comes out.  Some of those things are supposed to stay in my head.  Our phone number is 877-212-5762.  That's 877-212-5762. 
[00:07:00]  I know, no reason really to call and just giving the number out, but maybe you want to call  and say hi.  We welcome your calls.  Sure.  We're a very interactive radio show.  You don't have to wait for some wacky topic that you can relate to.  We don't care when you call.  Call, we'll plunk a phone line down and go, hey, what's your beef?  I like talking like it's the 30s.  Sounds good.  And then you get radio executives all over the country going, we're paying them for this?  What?  For this?  What?  They just go to the phones and just say hi to people. 
[00:07:30]  Bye.  I, uh, oh.  Is Sammy Hagar available to do a radio show?  I don't know what to do.  Uh, Rock Scream Tuesday, yes.  That's taken off, isn't it?  Well, Derek came up with something really funny.  Yeah.  And it might be too early to play.  Really?  Yeah, we're finding out.  We're learning how to do this morning radio thing.  Are we?  And radio executives, they're learning? 
[00:08:00]  Learning?  On the job training in the number one market?  What the?  Why?  How the?  What the?  How the?  How the?  What?  A bunch of...  But they're on the air in the number one market.  And they just said they're learning.  They're learning?  What?  They should have learned everything by now.  They should have learned everything when they were in Worcester, Mass.  They shouldn't still be learning in New York City.  That's right.  You don't get your chops when you're in the...  Pop.  Shut up. 
[00:08:30]  Pop.  Shut up.  Anyway, it might be too early for this.  I'm dying.  Can we get some AC?  Yeah.  Are you hot?  Well, I'm just sick and I hate being sick on my birthday.  It's not your birthday.  Oh, Jimmy.  Is it really your birthday?  Yeah.  Is it today?  No, it was just his birthday.  Stop.  Stop.  Remember?  When?  A few months ago.  No, he said it was...  He said it was his birthday on my birthday.  The selfish bastard.  Yeah, but he's also...  Oh, look. 
[00:09:00]  TV.  Why the hell are we on TV today?  I don't know.  There's Opie taking his fake call.  He's ripping me off.  Because I'm taking my fake call behind it.  Ah, that's good.  CW11.  We revealed that to who?  Billy Connolly?  That we were taking fake phone calls?  Yeah.  Yeah.  As we were under pressure from the media.  Whenever we get on camera and we take fake phone calls, we just take our cell phones out  and start talking into it.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:09:30]  I got a new one.  What's the new one?  I might have to use it.  Next time they just follow us with cameras all day long, I'm just going to be picking  my nose the entire time.  And each one you should roll up and show the camera.  Flick it at the lens.  I'm going to just be picking, flicking, and rolling.  Until the entire lens is covered.  Picking, rolling, flicking.  I forgot eating.  Roll, flick.  No, if you flick, you can't eat.  You can do both.  You can lick.  Picking, rolling, flicking, licking. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I like it.  All right, now it's not too early to play this.  See, we're stalling there.  Just to get people to wake up.  Because, you know, their alarms are set for 6 a.m.  Yeah, you don't want the alarm going off and having this play.  No.  Not at all.  This is pretty obnoxious.  Derek came up with this.  As a goof, we do this thing called Rock Scream Tuesdays.  Which we don't really do.  No, but now it's taken on a life of its own for some reason.  Of course it has.  For some reason, it's completely taken on a life of its own. 
[00:10:30]  So Derek came up with this.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[00:11:00]  Rock Scream!  And Anthony.  I have a feeling.  I have this strange feeling we're going to hear a lot more of those.  That rocked.  My God, did that rock?  Yeah, that was all right, man.  Wow.  Rock Scream Tuesday.  Rock, rock, rock, rock. 
[00:11:30]  Jimmy, you're under the weather.  You all right?  Yeah, I think so.  What do you got?  AIDS?  I don't think so.  A little of the AIDS.  That always makes my feet itch.  Does it?  Yeah.  A little known fact.  When you have AIDS, your feet itch.  AIDS or the gout?  No, I just have a colder thing or a little flu.  Really?  A flu.  It's probably a cold.  A cold and a flu.  That's a big difference, my friend.  Yeah, I don't feel like I'm completely incapacitated.  See, no one gets the flu in summertime, so it might be something else.  I would get checked out.  Oh, boy.  I think it's just...  People get the flu when the weather's cold and stuff, and they say when you get the flu 
[00:12:00]  when it's over 80 degrees, it could be something else.  Eesh.  I have a sore throat.  A little more sore throat in the middle of the summer?  I've had a rash on my hiney, too.  It's like a mandrel?  No, not not.  Like a baboon?  No.  Do you have a baboon hiney?  It was.  It was not.  We couldn't see it.  I just felt it was, like, itchy.  It was, like, my cheeks and the back of my legs.  Almost, like, because I had sat in a steam room, but I had a towel on it.  Oh, God.  It might have been...  It's, like, where you...  It's right where you'd sit on a seat. 
[00:12:30]  Of course it is.  Well, it could have been from a toilet, like, a cleaner products that they put on a toilet.  Like, it might have just been some type of cleaning products, like, something...  Where are you going?  I was at XM the day.  I stopped and used the bathroom on the way home, and I was in my own steam room.  That's the only thing I could think of.  I was outside my room.  What am I talking about?  Can we see your rash?  No, you can't see it.  It was just itching as I was trying to sleep.  Should have just used the boss's desk.  And in conjunction with that... 
[00:13:00]  Yes, yes.  This is true.  As you know, I shaved, and I switched razors, and I've had...  Let's just say this.  Oh, no.  My groin...  It's not like you have chicken pox.  No.  Oh, okay.  It feels like a tap-dancing ant colony.  It is itchy, itchy, itchy, and it's all, like...  Why?  It's horrible.  When you shave, hair comes back in, and it's, like, tickles.  I got it all figured out.  You got to use a brand new razor, and you just got to sweep the area once. 
[00:13:30]  What?  No itch, and no chicken pox.  How do you do it once?  Don't you have to go...  I'm not Italian, you freak.  No, I have to go...  I'm more wispy.  I'm not Italian.  You've got all those problems.  It's not problems.  It's just, you know...  You're wispy down there?  Not wispy.  I don't look like chemo head, either.  I'm talking...  You know, anytime you're shaving, it's kind of hard to just do one swipe and get all  the hairs off. 
[00:14:00]  See, that's all I got.  I'm not even looking.  I wouldn't even look.  I'm both his underpants.  The band of his underpants.  Yeah, so I'm a mess, man.  You're itching in the front, the back, the legs.  I switched razors, and I shaved, and it's coming back in, and it's driving me nuts.  Lady Bic, what are you using?  No, I should use those women.  So you don't hurt your fadge?  No, it's just itching like crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, it's the worst.  Oh, poor boy. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, we're getting a lot done with the first break here.  Yeah.  People are talking about Paris Hilton.  Are they, though?  Well, she called Barbara Walters.  Now, if you go to jail for DUI...  Yeah.  ...and we all know a lot of people that have been in jail for DUI.  Mm-hmm.  Let's be honest here.  I don't think you're allowed to just call Barbara Walters.  This is what I heard.  I love having the inside scuttlebutt.  That's what Jimmy has.  Scuttlebutt.  What, you roll over and tap Barbara on the shoulder and say, 
[00:15:00]  give me the inside scoop?  Hey, Babs.  I'll slip you a nither.  I'll slip you a nither if you give me the inside scoopage.  Skinny?  Apparently, the skinny.  Do you think someone actually sleeps with her?  No.  Not at all.  She's like...  Well, I was watching...  And this...  I know this sounds bad, but I take a peek at the viewer once in a while,  especially with that controversy with Rosie.  Now, I mean, I know she's on the show now,  and I'm one of the people that have said,  goodbye, don't need to watch this crap anymore. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  But before Rosie left, they were having a sex discussion,  and Barbara was, like, way in on the sex discussion,  like, the other ladies are kind of talking about sex,  and she's talking about it, Barbara Walters,  and I'm like, oh, my God!  There's a topless picture of her floating around from...  Yeah, oh, shouldn't have done that while you were drinking coffee.  Please say from at least three decades ago.  Yeah, it's real old.  All right.  It's real old, but...  I bet you even way back then she looked awful. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, it was awful.  She looked awful.  It was not an attractive shot.  No.  But here's the inside skinny I'm getting on that.  Apparently, Barbara Walters was on the phone with Paris Hilton's mother.  At the same time, lo and behold, Paris Hilton calls and decides,  hey, I think I want to talk to Barbara Walters.  So it was a spur-of-the-moment thing.  She was just calling home, and Barbara Walters happened to be calling her mom, 
[00:16:30]  and they decided, hey, you know, you want to talk to Barbara Walters?  What a lie.  Does that sound like the biggest bullcrap story?  Why was Barbara calling her to book a room somewhere?  Yeah, right.  Gee, by the way, your daughter's in jail.  Come on, stop.  Yeah, yeah.  We didn't know what was going on.  Yeah, of course.  Drug deal.  So she got on the phone with her and started spouting how she's a changed woman. 
[00:17:00]  She realizes how much older she is now, and she's not going to be stupid, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She found Gwad.  Did she?  Gwad.  Usually it takes a while in prison, like years in prison before you pick up that Bible and go, you know?  If you're in jail for less than a week for DUI, you're not going to find Gwad.  You have to get a little scuttlebutt in the shower before you hit the old Bible in prison.  Yeah.  And then, you know, you hit the Bible, you read through it, you've got plenty of time, and then you find Gwad.  I think you've got to be in for murder to find Gwad. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, that too.  Death row.  Not DUI.  Well, Paris actually had an incident in jail where there was a problem.  And somebody disrespected her in the line, and she broke a balloon of gas over their head,  and another prisoner behind them threw gas on the lady, and they settled it old school.  That sounds way too familiar, Jimmy.  That's a nice way to settle it.  I hear they filled up her light bulb with gasoline, and then when she turned on the switch.  Well, here's the latest on Paris, just to keep everyone up to date. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yes.  Just when you thought there couldn't be anything more to the Paris Hilton drama,  there is.  Barbara Walters had an exclusive telephone conversation with the Celebutante,  her first since being sent back to jail Friday to serve out the rest of her sentence  for violating parole on reckless driving charges.  Miguel Marquez has more.  It's the most riveting detail Paris Hilton shared with Barbara Walters during their exclusive conversation.  Back up!  Jail and the chaos over the past week has changed her life. 
[00:18:30]  I used to act dumb, said Hilton.  That act is no longer cute.  Now I would like to make a difference.  God has given me this new chance.  The jailed heiress confirmed to Walters just how terrible her initial three days in jail were.  It might explain why she cried when she was handcuffed and transported back to jail from her Hollywood Hills home.  I was not eating or sleeping, said Hilton.  I was severely depressed and felt as if I was in a cage. 
[00:19:00]  It was a horrible experience.  You know why she wasn't eating or going to the bathroom?  Did we talk about this on the show or was this a private conversation I was having with somebody?  You probably just thought this.  Don't you hate that?  Was that the show or was that like a conversation I was having?  Well, because it's, I don't know, it's interesting enough, but I'm like,  why would I repeat myself if everyone heard this already from our radio show?  But she didn't want the guards taking a cell phone picture of her and throwing it on the Internet?  And that's why she wasn't eating, because she figured if she ate, then she'd have to, you know, go to the bathroom. 
[00:19:30]  And I guess the toilet is right there in the open in front of a big window where the guards, you know, are watching the prisoners.  Can I throw something in here that people might have forgotten?  What?  There's a sex tape of her.  It's like, who cares if there's a picture of her eating or on the can?  There's a whole tape of her in that creepy green light with zombie eyes.  Sex tape is very hot and sexy. 
[00:20:00]  Having a hot girl on a bowl is hotter and sexier.  Exactly.  Where are you going with this?  To some people, but...  Speak German, Paris.  To some people, but I don't know.  I think there's a huge difference there in her world.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want a picture on the toilet.  That's a little creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  Unless you're doing an ad for, what was that, candy or something?  I don't know.  There's an ad on a toilet.  With what's her name that goes out with Jim Carrey. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, right?  Oh, well, she's the wacky one that just has no problem.  E-Rock, who's nice and tan today.  Picking her nose.  What, did you go to the tanning booth?  Did you go to the tanning booth?  You went to a tanning booth?  Oh, my God.  Why don't you just go outside?  Oh, E-Rock.  Well, we went, we were out over the weekend, and my girlfriend likes to tan, so I started  going with it. 
[00:21:00]  What, E-Rock?  I couldn't hear you.  You were drinking water.  Poor E-Rock.  So you went out, your girlfriend likes to be tanned, so you went into a room and tanned.  What?  Yeah.  Started going with her.  Oh.  Oh, God.  What do you wear in the tanning booth?  E-Rock's so in love, he's going to get skin cancer.  That's so cool.  Oh, how cool is that?  And look at Sam comes in with the camera right away.  Dude, just to come on.  You should stay away from those tanning booths. 
[00:21:30]  Wait a minute.  What do you have?  They always give you like a heart or something that you put on it so you can see how much  progress you've made.  Oh.  What do you have that you can put on your skin that shows you the progress you've made?  Um, I keep my underwear on.  Oh, let's see your tan line.  But don't you have big like underwear?  It goes from like your belly button down to your kneecaps.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  He just did the copper tone ad.  He did the copper tone ad with the girl with the doggy pulling down her little bikini bottoms.  It's the copper tone ad.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:22:00]  What are you doing?  He looks good.  Yeah, what if she started getting Brazilian waxes?  She'd start doing that, too.  No.  So, all right.  Well, E-Rock's tanning in the middle of the summer.  Well, shouldn't you hit a tanning booth like in February, January?  Now you can get the natural sun.  Candies.  Thank you.  All right.  And finally, here's more on Paris Hilton in jail with Barbara Walters.  Walters and Hilton's chat was unexpected. 
[00:22:30]  Walters was on the phone with Paris' mother, Kathy, when Paris rang in from jail.  Paris also wanted to talk to Walters, so the multimillionaire 26-year-old called Walters at her New York home.  Collect.  What did you say to Paris?  She's being strong.  Being strong.  That's how sister Nikki Hilton described Paris on Sunday.  Nikki and Paris' on-again, off-again boyfriends, Stavros Nyarkos, were the first two to visit the wayward socialite behind bars.  Earlier in a statement, Hilton directed her lawyers not to appeal her sentence and urged the media to focus on more important things, like Iraq. 
[00:23:00]  Hilton has about 14 days left to serve.  That's it.  14 days, and she's already found God.  And she wants them to talk about Iraq instead of her.  Yeah.  But see, her saying that is going to be in print.  So if you don't want anyone talking about you, then you wouldn't, like, just get on the phone with Barbara Walters.  And just fade away. 
[00:23:30]  Like, don't be the go-out-every-night-whore kind of thing image that the press loves to jump on.  She never made that point before when they were photographing her doing good things or at the award shows.  Yeah.  She never said, concentrate on Iraq.  Hey, concentrate on Iraq.  No, nothing.  I hope she comes out and she has two teardrops tattooed on her face.  Yeah.  Gang tats.  A couple of hits.  Big swastika over her breast.  Like American History X.  True cut.  She stomped on someone's teeth against a curb. 
[00:24:00]  Just all tatted out.  Tats everywhere.  Yeah.  Well, they never explained what her medical condition was.  Yeah.  I'm hoping she had so many hands in the back of her head that they had to remove a furball  from her throat.  The catch.  All right.  Well, this first break was a complete disaster.  I loved it.  No, it was fun.  I loved it. 
[00:24:30]  My birthday.  I'm sick.  We talked about Paris.  We talked about George Hamilton.  We played...  I think it really might be Hamilton.  George Hamilton.  Another ton joke.  Don't point at him, though.  We got to point...  You get to point and laugh on Fridays.  Today, you just get to laugh at him.  I love how he wears those big boxers.  I think it might be your birthday.  No, it was just his birthday.  I remember recently it being his birthday, and you said, this is your only day that you 
[00:25:00]  get to say it's your birthday because it's your birthday today.  Well, we usually celebrate his birthday.  Do you remember my birthday?  It was about a week away from when we did the HBO...  Lucky Louie released DVD signings.  I'm almost positive it's a week from today, but I'm not sure.  A week from today?  Birthday week?  I don't remember...  Yeah, your birthday's not that close to my birthday, and my birthday just passed.  I kind of remember Jim's birthday just passing.  It's in June.  Jim, your birthday's in January.  No!  You're crazy.  I had a 12-to-1 shot.  I know that much. 
[00:25:30]  I think it's like June, or maybe...  No, it's not early July, because it's the 4th of July.  I'm going to go with June 23rd.  No, no, no, no, no.  June 12th.  It's my mommy's birthday.  June 12th.  That's today!  It is not!  It's not your birthday today.  Your birthday's not even in June.  I kind of remember him, like, saying that it was his birthday, and all of us were like, 
[00:26:00]  all right, today's your birthday, but...  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  I yelled and screamed, because he said it was his birthday on my birthday.  No, I remember that, too.  But I do remember his actual birthday.  We let him have that day, because it was actually his birthday.  Kenny, when is his birthday?  You guys don't remember the guy?  We had the guy on the bike taking me from here to XM on my birthday.  That was a summer thing.  Oh, oh, remember?  Okay, his birthday.  I was going to say there was a rickshaw guy.  Yeah.  And don't lie.  July 19th. 
[00:26:30]  And I know it's true.  Wow, he sold you right out.  I know, from your face.  Why?  I don't know.  Where does his loyalties lie like that?  You couldn't keep the bit going?  We could have ran with this all morning.  I must speak the truth.  Wow.  Could have just gone to Internet Movie Database.  It would have had a different Jim Norton, though.  No, I've seen you.  I've seen you on there.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  Right. 
[00:27:00]  I'm going to explain the ending of The Sopranos in mere minutes.  Why don't you just let him spoil it?  This second.  Yeah, Kenny.  Kenny.  After the break, I want you to explain the ending of The Sopranos.  Oh.  All right?  My interpretation?  Yeah.  All right.  You better get writing.  We'll go to you next.  But let's not forget, it's Rock Scream Tuesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We'll be right back. 
[00:27:30]  It's Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[00:28:00]  Rock Scream.  Bop, bop.  And Anthony.  Hi.  Good morning.  Welcome to The O.P. and Anthony Show.  If you're just tuning in, that music's a little loud, huh?  Yes.  If I was in bed right now and I heard that blasting out of my clock radio, I wouldn't be too happy.  That's all right.  I think we've got to slowly, uh, slowly rock.  What is it?  Roger, oh, Chris Docher.  Docher, Roger Docher.  Don't play.  Roger Docher. 
[00:28:30]  I caught myself.  Phone number 877-212-5762.  Adam Ferraro stopping in today.  Yes.  We've got a phone call from Carlos Mencia.  We've got, uh, Dennis Hoff.  Oh, Dennis.  Talking about our Father's Day giveaway.  Yeah, that's a good one.  One lucky father's going off to the Bunny Ranch in Nevada for a date.  For a date.  With a girl.  Yeah, we're going to take more of your horror stories.  We're looking to take care of a couple dads this, uh, Father's Day.  And Bear, uh, definitely in the lead.  He's the front runner. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  Pathetic mess.  Married four kids.  Uh, hasn't had sex in 12 years.  His, uh, wife openly admitted on our show that she doesn't give a crap.  Doesn't even really love him anymore.  Doesn't love him.  She's too busy with the big house.  Big house.  All the cats that she collects.  Fifteen cats.  And four kids.  Four kids.  A job.  And she's got no interest whatsoever in sex of any kind with her husband.  Now, she pretty much admitted she's the problem.  Yeah.  Because Bear wants to have sex, right? 
[00:29:30]  Yep.  And I was thinking about Bear and Louise, uh, the other day.  And I'm thinking, now let's say Bear decides to get a divorce.  Mm-hmm.  He gets screwed.  Totally.  He totally gets screwed, even though...  He's not getting part of the marriage contract.  Even, yeah, even though it's her problem.  She's reneged on the contract.  Yeah.  She's in breach.  Unbelievable.  But we'll take more of your stories in a little while.  But someone, and possibly their son, will be flown out to the Bunny Ranch in Nevada for a date. 
[00:30:00]  You know what, though?  She's on the air saying that she wouldn't have sex with them for 12 years.  To me, that is grounds for divorce if he wanted it.  Oh, yeah, but he doesn't want it.  Right.  He said, he goes, no, I got, you know, my kids, and he's got his stuff.  It's grounds for divorce, but he still loses, like, you know,  a lot, pretty much everything.  Yeah.  The guys pretty much lose everything in these cases.  Yes, they do.  I'm starting to suspect my parents are swingers, and it's giving me the creeps.  I just heard somebody say something, and it couldn't have come out of anyone's mouth. 
[00:30:30]  We just saw your mom and dad at the HBO table.  She's just a little, like, sweet little lady.  You know something, though?  She looks like a librarian.  They were, you know, they were young in, what, the 60s and stuff,  so they probably have that mindset, right?  Yeah.  Oh, brother.  They went away with another couple somewhere.  Ew.  It just really gives me the creeps.  Where?  Some island.  My dad gave me, left me a message, and I forget where they went, 
[00:31:00]  but it was like, ugh.  It just bothered me.  Oh, ooh, with another couple.  Yeah, I don't know why it annoyed me.  Like, it just happens.  Is that the only reason you have to suspect this?  Are you just like...  I don't know.  Or do they say things, or...  How funny would that be?  I mean, they don't do anything obvious.  Like, they're not around...  They don't see, like, a UPS guy with strapping big arms,  and I catch my father going, get his info.  There's nothing like that.  So they went away with this other couple, and you're just... 
[00:31:30]  Anything else.  I just know that, and there's something about the tone of the message.  You don't want to...  The tone of the message.  What was the tone?  I don't know.  I just didn't like it.  No, you...  It just bothered me.  No, what?  But there was something in the message.  Oh, this is creeping me out, seeing Jimmy so creeped out.  You think your mom drops, like, ecstasy and stuff?  No, I don't think she's a drug.  She probably has, like, a little...  What do older people drink?  Something cream, like a Bailey's?  A Bailey's.  No, I didn't know.  What did Judy used to drink back in the day?  Grandma, yay. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Grandma, yay.  Yeah.  So what do you think?  Like, they're hanging out on vacation, and then at one point they'll go,  Hey, you know, we're going to go into this room over here,  and some guy takes your mom in there, and your dad takes some...  I hope they don't swap.  I hope...  Oh.  I hope that they're view-only and not swappers.  I hope my parents don't go to the swamp.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Do you think that might be happening, the swamp? 
[00:32:30]  I think your dad's just a watcher.  He probably is.  He just sits in the corner nude.  And also, it's a horrific face.  Oh, stop.  I'm happy to your mom.  We just saw them at the HBO taping.  That's what makes this so hot.  Hot.  My dad's a cuckold.  You think he just watches?  Your dad watches from the corner of the bedroom and just, like, breaks down and cries.  You know, your deviant behavior has to come from somewhere.  So perhaps it wouldn't, you know... 
[00:33:00]  The obvious choice is Jimmy's dad, but I think it's the mom.  I think she's into some freaky thing.  The log doesn't fall far from the...  I don't know.  I just know that I got a message, and it was...  Yeah, what was it?  I still have it, but I can't replay the whole thing.  This part of it, I'll have to...  I've only heard it one time, but I'm sad that I'm like...  You can't replay the whole thing?  Get your mom on the phone now, but she's sucking...  No.  It was...  This hedonism is terrific. 
[00:33:30]  We love this.  Yeah, they went to some island with another couple, and I don't know why it was like...  It all depends on the island, I guess.  What island?  Bermuda, something like that.  I don't know.  Bermuda is like...  Bermuda.  That's an old people's island.  Is that an old people's island?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know why it bothered me.  It shouldn't have.  Can we play the message?  I have to go through it again.  There's stuff in there.  I probably can't.  What happens with the message, though, that...  There's something in that message.  What is it?  I don't know.  It was just...  He was saying, you know, hello to everybody, and, you know, it was a very nice message.  I don't know why. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, he was a little too happy, right?  Well, it was almost like...  A little too happy on Jimmy's voicemail.  It was...  I don't know why it bugged me.  I can't put my finger on it.  Maybe because I've never heard them say anything.  But I've been hanging out with more couples lately, I guess.  Oh, no.  It's like since they moved away, my dad, like, retired, they've been hanging out with more couples.  Maybe they're just, like, part of a nudist colony.  They don't use their real names.  My dad is a taffy bag, Jim. 
[00:34:30]  Maybe they're just, like, part of a nudist colony.  Well, that's good.  Somebody's suggesting they're drinking Donald from Detroit.  Harvey Wallbangers.  I'll have a Harvey Wallbanger?  Oh, they get me wild.  Speaking of wallbanging...  Oh, I don't know.  You don't know.  It's probably not that they could have just hit me to say it.  I know.  I've heard the message.  No.  Yeah, come on, Jimmy.  I can't picture that.  We just saw your parents down there in Washington.  Yeah.  They're not the swinging type.  I've never thought so either, but lately they've been hanging out with other couples, and going 
[00:35:00]  away with another couple is just creepy.  Going away is a little...  Seems too happy, huh?  I don't know what it was about the tone.  I'll listen to it again, and I'll give you an update.  I don't know what the tone of the message was.  I just...  I hadn't mentioned it.  It happened, like, four or five days ago.  You didn't hear any moans and groans in the background while your dad was on the phone  with you?  You ever...  Is that mom?  You ever hear your parents having sex?  No.  Um, but I did, many, many years ago, find a prophylactic in the toilet.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  When I was young. 
[00:35:30]  I was probably 14.  Eesh.  15.  Sorry.  Guess they didn't want...  No, you don't want to think your dad's doing that.  But, uh...  Was your little brother in there?  There was a whole bunch of what could have beens.  And, um, yeah, I found that it kind of...  It was supposed to have gone away, and I guess the, uh, the water didn't take it where  it was supposed to be.  Oh, wow.  Pop back up for a friendly hello.  Wow.  I think that's lovely.  It really is creepy to think about your parents having sex.  Oh, it's awful.  It's awful.  What about you, Ant?  Uh, yeah, I actually, um, heard, which is even worse, was, um, after, uh, a dear old 
[00:36:00]  dad went out to California, um, mom would, uh, you know, have Sal over.  This was before they got married, many years ago.  Uh, and, and I'd hear, like, Sal giving it to my mom.  Are you serious?  Oh, it was awful.  Didn't he know?  And one time, one time it was, um, because he was, like, he, he was a brand new guy coming  to the house.  We didn't know him or like him or anything at the time. 
[00:36:30]  You know, I love Sal now.  He's been around forever now.  Yeah, the guy's been around for years, since the, you know, 70s.  Wow.  Uh, so he's been, he's been around for, for quite a while.  And, um, but this is like right when he first started coming by and we're like, who is this  guy?  And then all of a sudden you're just hearing those awful sounds of the moaning, groaning  and, uh, and, and stuff from the bedroom.  And my brother got so pissed off.  He grabbed a baseball bat and banged on the door.  He's like, knock it off.  Knock it off. 
[00:37:00]  Didn't they realize you guys were home?  Yeah, but they didn't care.  They care.  They didn't care.  Well, why would they care?  They're just like in lust.  Did you hear them say anything?  No, I didn't hear any talking.  It was just pure, like grunting and moaning.  Pure lust.  And you hear like the guy grunt and then the woman grunt.  And then you realize, ew, that's mom.  She's getting it on.  Were you trying to picture what position they were in?  No, I didn't picture anything.  I would put the pillow over my head and like, like, start crying and go, make it go away. 
[00:37:30]  Stop doing that to my mommy.  Stop doing that to my mommy.  No.  I was a little too old for the crying thing at that point.  But, no, I would just cover up my ears and stuff.  Didn't matter.  At that point, like, she would leave to go to work and we'd drag girls in there and have sex with them.  So that house was like a goddamn whorehouse.  How awful are your moms in the next room having sex and you're laying there like Joker in full metal jacket with your hands over your ears?  I was. 
[00:38:00]  I did not want to hear it.  Oh, that was really rude.  And then Joe went after Sal with a bat one day.  He went after him?  Why?  Yeah.  I just, he didn't like the whole thing about the hearing, the moans and groans.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So Sal came to the door and Joe was like, what do you want?  And he goes, I'm here to see your mother.  And Joe's like, yeah, well, you mother F.  And he started, like, cursing him out and talking about things and yelling about hearing noises.  I want to hear that sound through the, you two in the room right next to us. 
[00:38:30]  So that was, you know.  Your brother was C-blocking your mom, man.  Good.  Good.  How old was Joe?  Joe was probably 18 at the time.  Joe was like the father figure.  Oh, Joe was a ball buster.  Because he was the older brother there.  Back then, yeah, he didn't want to hear it.  And he'd let you know.  Yeah, you know.  I was just like, hi.  Hi, glad you're enjoying my mom.  That was me.  I didn't care.  Could we go throw the baseball around? 
[00:39:00]  I need a father figure.  Could we go out back and toss around the ball?  Could we do something normal instead of hang out at a bar?  I figure since you're banging my mom and I hear it, perhaps we could do some fatherly things.  You know, if I got to sit there with a pillow over my head and clenching it so hard to my ears that I can't even breathe, perhaps, you know.  Perhaps we could go to the park and fly a kite. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, maybe we could do that.  Fly a kite.  That's good.  Then I won't feel so bad when I hear you just banging my mom at night.  Schooling your mom.  Schooling her.  How ironic that many years later you're still like your face in a pillow for a second.  Oh, it's just awful.  That's kind of weird because Sal's been around.  I even know that Sal's been around a long time.  Sal's been around.  You thought he was just a guy that was just trying to get some? 
[00:40:00]  Probably 30 years.  Wow.  Maybe a little less, but yeah.  Does Joe like him now?  Oh, yeah.  We love Sal.  He's like our dad, you know.  The guy's fantastic.  Were you convinced he was just trying to get some, though, at the time?  Nah.  Well, you know something?  He was a little more sincere than some of the other gentlemen that stopped the kite.  Let's just put it that way.  You know.  I don't.  Well, look.  Here's the situation.  Dude, it's not.  I understand what you're going to say.  You had a single mom that was very young. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  My mom got divorced.  I can't even imagine that.  She had to raise three kids by herself.  So then when we reached the point where we were able to, you know, take care of ourselves  as well as we could, she went out to, you know, live a life, have a little fun.  She was a cocktail waitress at discos all over Long Island, you know.  She kept herself in good shape.  So, you know, there were always guys coming on to her and stuff.  She's still in good shape.  Hey, enough.  Wow.  Enough.  Absolutely.  I don't want to hear that. 
[00:41:00]  This is ancient history.  No, she's still in great shape.  Ancient history.  What?  All that stuff.  What stuff?  You know.  She's still in shape.  The before Sal.  Wow.  It's almost stuttering.  I don't think Sal likes hearing the before Sal days.  Remember the story that got us in big trouble.  Yeah.  He basically threatened our lives.  Sal was a little serious.  Well, that's because, you know what it was?  It wasn't so much us talking about this because it's part of life and everybody in general, 
[00:41:30]  but the listeners get a little carried away and they started saying, like, bad things.  And Sal, at that point, we were, like, he was new to this whole radio thing also and  didn't quite understand that listeners are a bunch of, you know, jackasses and they'll  say awful things.  So when I brought up a couple of instances where perhaps a gentleman caller came over the  house to have a date out with my mommy, the listeners took it to the extreme.  And Sal called our show and threatened us. 
[00:42:00]  And threatened to kill us if this line of programming and call taking.  And considering what he used to do for a living, we knew he was dead serious.  The guy was a legitimate union organizer.  What?  He was a what?  He's a retired union organizer.  Leave him alone.  So when a guy like that calls your radio show, it threatens your life.  You better take it serious.  It wasn't like he was working at UPS or something.  He was a union organizer?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  What was his name back then when he did that?  Right.  Now that he's been hiding.  Salvatore.  Sal the nose.  What was his nickname?  Sal.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Baltimore Sal.  Oh, there you go.  Baltimore Sal threatened our lives.  Great bunch of guys down there.  Threatened his stepson, basically, live on our show.  Because people got, well, my mom was a big baseball fan.  She liked the Mets.  But stop. 
[00:43:00]  That's all I'm saying.  What?  You lost me.  What?  You lost me.  Well, she went out on a date with one of the Mets.  Did she really?  Yeah.  Doc Gooden?  No, it was.  See, say that was the bit.  That was it.  I don't want the phone call.  How many phone calls we got about Mookie Wilson?  Yeah, yeah.  They all looked up the old Mets lineup from the late 70s.  Everyone, everyone was trying to guess.  And that was the bit.  And everyone.  Shut up, Jimmy. 
[00:43:30]  The phone call is going to come in in a second now.  Daryl Strawberry.  It was like everybody was bringing up names.  Was it Ed Cranepool?  No, it wasn't Ed Cranepool.  It was.  It was.  Leon Jones.  No.  Rusty Staub.  No.  Bob Apodaca.  No, he wasn't even a name.  If you heard the rumors about Rusty.  He was.  Oh, really?  What rumors about Rusty?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, I did hear that rumor.  Wait, was it a rumor that Staub was shortened from trombone? 
[00:44:00]  No, it was a relief pitcher.  All right, stop.  I'm telling you to stop.  Well, no, as long as it doesn't go where it went last time.  This is fine.  This is my mother's past.  It's going back 30 years ago.  30 years.  Find a relief pitcher from 30 years ago.  No, it's all right.  It's all right.  I don't want the phone call.  That was a scary phone call.  What? 
[00:44:30]  You won't say his name?  I don't think it matters.  Why wouldn't it?  It's just a date.  It's not nothing.  Yeah, I don't even know.  Just don't.  I'll tell you one thing that happened that was pretty funny.  Oh, God.  It was Ed Glynn.  Just a relief pitcher.  Too bad it wasn't Fred Gwynn.  No, it wasn't Fred Gwynn.  That would have been cool.  Mom's bringing home Herman Munster.  Your mom dated a Met hack.  Well, he never really had a career.  He was barely in baseball. 
[00:45:00]  Ugh.  Ed Flynn's a ball-like player.  I just...  Ed Glynn.  Glynn.  I mean...  I just remember one evening before he was pitching the next day that perhaps they were  doing something where Ed Glynn...  What are you getting into now?  I am not going any further with that.  Wow.  But it was...  It was, you know, very popular around that time.  And, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  You...  And completely blew, uh... 
[00:45:30]  The game.  And don't make any jokes about what I just said.  This...  This...  Don't do any plays on words or sound call.  Wait.  There's a couple of things you can do with a razor.  Well, not in the 70s.  You weren't using it to shave with.  You were right.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey.  How great is that?  What?  Ah, it was great.  You know, he'd come over and, you know, I'd be like, hey, look, it's a mitt. 
[00:46:00]  Did you get to throw the ball around with him?  Uh, no.  No.  He wasn't interested in your mom then.  I probably...  I caught a fleeting glimpse of this guy.  He wasn't interested.  That's about it.  He wasn't interested in going, uh, all nine innings.  That was about it.  He was a, uh, middle right.  My, my, my mommy.  This is 30 years ago.  She did a damn good job raising three kids.  We all, uh, successful and out of trouble.  And, uh, she did a fine job.  And she wanted to live a part of her life. 
[00:46:30]  Uh, and then she did.  And then she settled down.  Found Sal.  Settle down.  Find a nice gentleman.  And, uh, you know, they've been, uh, happily married for years now.  What about the Met?  What ever happened?  Like, did he, like, have to...  I don't know.  Did he go on and leave baseball?  She'd find out what happened to him.  I don't know.  She hooked up with Mr. Met after that.  But that didn't last because he couldn't come in through the door.  That big baseball head.  All right.  Listen.  That's my mommy.  That's wonderful.  Why don't we take a break before Sal calls? 
[00:47:00]  I'm a little paranoid.  That phone call from Sal, I'll never forget.  No, because it didn't go where it went.  Why Sal got mad.  Yeah.  That's all.  If Sal's listening, I, Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show,  I, uh, I had nothing to do with the last 20 minutes.  Sal knows I love my mommy and I love Sal.  All right.  They're both, uh, great people.  Uh, I could explain the ending of The Sopranos.  I was, uh, privy to a fine email that went around to about seven people across America. 
[00:47:30]  Seven people?  I was one of the people.  I was one, too.  You got it, too?  Oh, because I forwarded it to you, right?  Than?  Did you forward it to Than also?  You got it, too?  Yeah.  Oh.  Is it already on Snopes?  It explains the ending of The Sopranos, and now I'm thinking that David Chase might  be brilliant.  Uh, you, yesterday, we're not saying that.  I'll read the email I got, uh, after the break.  All right.  And we got to talk about the death of Vince McMahon today. 
[00:48:00]  Uh, why isn't this in all the newspapers and, uh, on CNN, Fox News?  It's only on the WWE website, apparently.  Uh, there's a limo, uh, uh, if you're just tuning in and listening.  They got the scoop, that's all.  There was a tragic, uh, limo explosion at one of the events.  What event was it?  Who cares?  Uh, who cares?  And, um, a tragic limo explosion, and, uh, Vince McMahon is presumed dead in the explosion.  But, not a word about it in any of the papers or the news organizations, just on the WWE 
[00:48:30]  website.  Can I, uh, make, uh, the observation of the thing?  Uh, yes.  Vince McMahon is a cheap F.  He goes all out to, uh, to have this limo blow up.  Yeah.  So everyone is going to presume he's dead, and that'll be the next storyline with the  WWE, and who knows how he can back from it.  Uh-huh.  Boo!  The guy couldn't even, like, he's a ghost.  Thank you, Jimmy.  He can't even break character for the ghost line. 
[00:49:00]  Boo!  The guy blows up a very old limo.  Yeah.  I mean, come on, man.  I think I went to my prom in that limo.  It's like, come on, man.  If you want us to believe that this could possibly be true, why don't you, why don't you blow  up a limo from this decade?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that limo at one point had, uh, Nazi flags flying from the fenders while  it drove Hitler around.  You make enough money.  Yeah, you know, why don't you, why don't you commit to the, uh, the storyline there? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony on this rock.  Blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah.  Ooh.  Ooh, you too.  Go check it out, the Opie and Anthony show.  Getting very excited, the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Oh, yeah.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  Four days out?  Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday.  And then she blows up like Vince McMahon. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, that Vince McMahon video is very ridiculous.  We were analyzing it the whole commercial.  We are idiots.  We're idiots.  We completely, we're doing exactly what they want us to do.  We're analyzing the stupid Vince McMahon blowing up in the limousine video.  Yeah.  And Opie's, uh, uh, come to the conclusion that it's a fake leg that is sticking out of  Well, it has to be.  It didn't really blow up Vince McMahon.  Well, if you ask Sam, Sam's convinced.  Every time he watches it, Sam goes, oh, this is so tragic.  Oh, this is terrible.  Like, Sam is completely convinced Vince is dead. 
[00:50:30]  And now we're trying to figure out who would blow up Vince McMahon.  I'm thinking Ivan, uh, Putzky.  Ivan Putzky?  I'm thinking the Polish Hammer.  That's a long-standing grudge, then.  I think there's a grudge that goes way back to the J.J. Strongbow, uh, era.  That is going back.  It was Bob Backlund.  Bob Backlund.  Bob Backlund?  Bruno San Martino.  Look at that car explode.  Never got the respect he deserves and decided to blow up Vince McMahon. 
[00:51:00]  So now is it going to be a who shot J.R., who killed Mr. Burns kind of a storyline on WWE?  Is that what we're led to believe?  And, E-Rock, what did you do?  Did you email somebody?  What was the email?  I, uh, I emailed the WWE to see if, uh, Vince could call in to talk about his death.  Vince McMahon is not going to call in to talk about his death if he's dead.  I think that was the joke. 
[00:51:30]  Maybe you could have just laid under the car and caught some rays.  You could have gotten a hell of a tan under that car.  No kidding.  Either way, I hope he gets a horrible...  I hope he falls asleep and the machine kicks out high and he's a scalded, lobster-faced idiot.  We can slap him.  Hey, call our, uh...  Call our old friend Taz.  Yeah, because Taz's going to be, I think he's going to be on that stage at, uh, Jones Beach this Saturday.  Taz could be a suspect.  Yeah, let's call up Taz and see if he knows what's going on with Vince McMahon's death. 
[00:52:00]  God, it's got us talking about wrestling for the first time in three years, so, you know, he did something right last night.  Oh, well, now it's making, uh, what, what, what newspaper is this from?  Yeah, what, uh...  What responsible publication periodical is this from?  Yeah, WWE.com got the, the scoop, but now it's spreading.  What is this?  It's a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, which is where most of the big news breaks.  Yeah, absolutely.  Does it say AP?  Ooh, it doesn't say AP.  No, I don't see any AP.  I don't see any Reuters. 
[00:52:30]  What do we got, Travis?  That's from WWE.com.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, if Vince McMahon is dead, you would think, you know, the AP or Reuters would pick up on this one.  Wow.  Let me just give the headline here.  Uh, a night originally, uh, designated Mr. McMahon Appreciation Night turned deadly when the WWE chairman's limousine burst into a fiery explosion just moments after Mr. McMahon stepped into it.  Permanently uprooting the world of sports entertainment, the chairman has been presumed dead in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 
[00:53:00]  Why do they say Vince at all on this?  It's all Mr. McMahon.  Mr. McMahon.  It's respect.  Uh, local authorities stated it was still too early to declare anything as fact, including exactly what caused the explosion, but described the blast as, uh, an apparent car bombing.  They also revealed that as of 11.30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, no body has been recovered from the incinerated wreckage.  Interesting.  No body recovered.  Sam, I know you're, you're really busted up about this. 
[00:53:30]  I hope you can even talk on mic.  Sam, I don't know, man.  Sam, how are you holding up?  Not well.  Not well.  Every time he watches the explosion, it just takes another piece of him.  Uh, the, the kids, uh, all busted up about this.  It was supposed to be Mr. McMahon Appreciation Night.  Yeah.  People were disrespecting him all night.  Right.  We don't know who it could have been.  It was obviously some kind of bomb.  Ah, obviously a bomb.  So you're saying, yeah, it was a bomb.  Obviously the cameraman knows what's going on because they got a wide shot. 
[00:54:00]  They were focused on the, on the car, on the limo.  And then they pulled back for a wide shot for no reason whatsoever.  Well, because the cameraman knew what was going on and didn't tell Mr. McMahon for whatever  reason.  So you would say, question the cameraman immediately.  First thing.  And who are you suspecting?  Hacksaw?  Could be Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  Yeah.  I don't know why he was there, but I saw him there.  And what about the Polish Hammer?  What do you think?  Ivan Putzky?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a prime suspect of mine right now. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I think so too.  Yeah.  Jimmy, who do you think?  I think it was a suicide.  It can't be a suicide.  Well, he was very broken up about losing the ECW world title.  So it could have been a suicide.  You're right, Jim.  This incident is the first of its kind since the assassination of political figure Orlando  Letalier in Washington, D.C. in 1976.  Sources say that given the nature of the apparent car bombing under law, federal authorities will 
[00:55:00]  be called in for more thorough investigation that would supersede local Pennsylvania authorities.  Check back with WWE.com as we continue to follow the developments in the most shocking incident  in sports entertainment history.  Easily.  Wow.  Wow.  Vince McMahon, dead?  I guess Vince McMahon decided to give us the ending that the Sopranos couldn't give us. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, that was it.  Thank you, Vince.  Jesus.  Vince decided.  Who saw this coming?  Oh, is that perfect?  What a hack.  Hey, our friend Taz is on the phone.  Hey, Taz.  What's up, guys?  What the hell's going on?  How are you holding up today, Taz?  Well, I just woke up thanks to the call.  You haven't been in mourning?  How could you sleep when Vince McMahon is presumed dead in a horrific limo explosion?  Well, you know, I was nervous about it last night. 
[00:56:00]  I couldn't sleep because I was worried about who the hell's going to pay me.  Goddamn, Taz.  But then once I found out that, you know, Shane O'Mac and Stephanie, I guess, could take  care of their funds, I was all right.  I went to sleep.  I slept like a rock.  You slept like a baby.  Who cares?  You have no interest or care in finding out who did this and bringing them to justice?  No, I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  I mean, you know, I'm just like you guys.  To tell you the God's honest truth, we had no idea.  And that's the truth.  We didn't know what was going to happen. 
[00:56:30]  It wasn't like, well, you know, the old saying, well, it's in the script.  No, it wasn't like that.  This is something that came out of God.  It came out of nowhere.  You don't know.  You know, I mean, they wanted to get everyone's reaction as far as surprise.  The funniest thing was sitting in the live house in the arena.  And after it happened, I mean, while it happened, I looked at the monitor, all the announcers,  we were like, whoa, that was pretty wild.  And you look at the live crowd, and it was like silent.  Everybody was like, whoa, how'd they do that? 
[00:57:00]  You know, I put it on.  How'd they do that?  How'd they do that?  They were like, it was like a little bit of a hush.  I mean.  How'd they do that?  They hired Chris Angel to help them out.  How'd they do that?  Would you like to respond to that, Sam?  How did they do that?  I mean, what do you mean, how did they get the bomb on the car?  Listen, we're in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, considered a sauce.  So, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what we're going to do.  What's happening?  I don't know.  If anyone could survive it, I'd say it'd be Vince. 
[00:57:30]  I hope so.  We love our fans in Wilkes-Barre, but let's be honest.  They picked the perfect place to try to pull this out.  Oh, jeez.  Are you saying that maybe they're not as sharp?  You know.  If they did it in Philly, you know, someone would die for this.  Yeah, okay.  But honestly, I don't know what's happening.  I mean, at the end of the show, I'm like, all right, where's Vince?  I didn't see him.  I didn't see him.  I walked to my car, and I'm thinking my car was only about maybe 70 yards from that explosion. 
[00:58:00]  I'm like, oh, jeez, man.  Now my car's going to be on fire here.  I'm like, this is my wife.  Taz is so self-centered.  Yeah, well, Taz, did the fans wonder why Vince was getting into a limo that was last  used at the Tangiers Hotel?  I mean, come on.  You might be able to trick the fans at Wilkes-Barre, but you're not tricking Opie and Anthony.  That limo looked like it's from, like, 1985.  No, I know you guys are sharp. 
[00:58:30]  That limo stinks.  Actually, the fact of the matter is that was the only limo in Wilkes-Barre.  Oh, that's okay.  There's only one limo.  Well, wow, somebody must have rigged it with explosives.  But no body has been found.  Now, that's a little odd, but that might give you a little hope there.  Well, wait.  Listen, listen, it's smarting me up.  So, WWE.com, because I didn't see any of that stuff.  What would they say on there?  Well, they're saying that no body has been recovered from the incinerated wreckage, 
[00:59:00]  but they're assuming he's had to have been killed and probably just burnt to a crisp.  That's what it looked like.  It was a huge explosion.  Yes, yes, Sam.  We know.  We saw it, Sam.  We understand.  Sam's pretty busted up.  The video's pretty hacky, because you see Vince McMahon go in,  and his leg is still dangling.  Then the leg goes in, and then the leg comes out,  which would be, obviously, now the fake leg.  Then George's leg from Otto and George pokes out the bottom of the door.  Right.  You guys sound like you figured it out on me. 
[00:59:30]  We could have, Taz.  Maybe.  You know, we're skeptics.  I might, and I might be going for the conspiracy theory here.  There might be multiple assassins.  Yeah.  I just want to get paid.  I mean, really, I don't want to be rude.  I don't want to make sure I'm getting paid for my contract.  I've got to talk to my super agent.  Then again, since the other thing went away, I don't even hear from him no more.  Think of the family, Taz.  Think of the McMahon family and empire.  Well, there's going to be a power play now for the WWE with Vince Conn.  This throws a whole monkey wrench into the whole works. 
[01:00:00]  I guess they're talking to the Brooklyn Brawler, seeing where he was last night.  The Brooklyn Brawler.  Well, it's funny you mention him, because he wasn't there last night.  Ah.  All right.  Anthony, you missed something, by the way.  What?  Taz, you've got the same agent as us, right?  Yeah, I do.  And he hasn't talked to you since Free FM went back to rock.  Yeah, that's pretty true, yeah.  Ah, come on.  We share Taz as an agent? 
[01:00:30]  No, he's got super agent Bobby.  Yeah.  Oh.  I think he's dealing with the other guys who are probably still crying in San Francisco.  You know what his closing move is?  The sleeper voice.  That's what Bob uses.  He talks to you and lulls you to sleep with his boring conversation.  Tremendous.  You know, Bob's got a tough gig.  When it's going good, it's going great for him.  And then, like, you know, you get a lot of these guys out of work, and he just avoids smoke calls. 
[01:01:00]  So the guy just disappeared.  I mean, just like gone.  So email, text message, gone.  Take care.  Bob, give Taz a call.  Gone.  See you later.  All right.  I would never want to be an agent.  No.  All right, Taz.  Well, thank you for your insight on this.  It's apparently the breaking news from Taz.  He was sleeping, didn't know, doesn't care, wants to get paid.  Right.  That's the headline.  But, Taz, you hanging with us at Jones Beach Saturday?  Yeah, I'll be there.  Yeah, I'll be there.  I'll hang out with you guys.  Nice.  I'll help you out.  I think you're doing some signings and stuff, right? 
[01:01:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I didn't hear that.  Hey, slow down.  Signings?  What are you doing?  I heard you might be signing stuff in the O&A Village.  I don't know.  We'll get a limo for you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  A white one.  Yeah.  Yeah, a white one.  Exactly.  They haven't used white limos since 1979.  I know.  Since Leonard Skinner put out their last LP.  Tom Hanks came out the sunroof of that one in big.  Right.  Vince, man. 
[01:02:00]  We've got to talk to Vince.  Come on.  Yeah, forget Vince on the phone.  Come on.  What a great storyline.  But, you know, make it believable.  Get a nice black limo from 2005.  2005.  Something newer.  Yeah.  He's old school.  He is old school.  He might like that.  You know what?  Maybe you guys remember.  Oh, you don't remember this.  What?  Al, um, the guy, Torrey Wilson's father who died on the show.  Al Wilson.  You know, none of you guys remember that.  No.  One of your guys over there might remember that.  We had a storyline.  Uh, here's Sam.  Like, yeah, I know exactly what Taz is saying. 
[01:02:30]  Sorry, Sam.  No, we're not the experts on wrestling.  No, I don't want to be either.  It's my job.  I got to be.  Sam, what's the story?  Sam, do you know it?  I think, uh, Torrey Wilson's father, Al, ended up having an affair with one of the other divas.  And, uh, I think he had a heart attack on TV or something.  Oh, wait a minute.  You're good.  I almost remember that.  Yeah.  You really have no life.  You're good.  I watch a lot of movies.  No, no, no.  Yeah, so it'd be good now.  Maybe there's a match in hell or heaven with Al Wilson and Vince. 
[01:03:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe by the time I get to Jones Beach, we'll have, uh, we'll come to, come to the bottom  of this.  Yeah, you can give us a little more info.  I'm sure you'll get some answers tonight.  You gotta watch, uh, a little plug action here.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  We'll watch tonight.  ECW tonight.  You got us, uh, you got us interested again.  Oh, so maybe ECW has something to do with this.  They could easily.  Huh?  Could easily, Sam says.  Could easily.  Sam's a former ECW champion and he's been distraught since losing the ECW title, guys. 
[01:03:30]  Let's wake up.  Gut shot Drew, uh, from Instant Feedback.  I saw Coco Beware lurking in the shadows of his parents.  Coco Beware.  Well, I'd like to say something.  There's no way you can see Coco in a shadow.  Oh.  Oh, no.  You gotta be kidding me.  Inappropriate, Bell.  Way to take the fun out of the room there, Taz.  That's why Bob isn't calling you.  That's why Bob ain't calling you.  That's right.  He doesn't have time for people like you. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, look.  We're on TV again.  Why are we on TV?  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  Fake phone call.  There's Opie taking his fake phone call.  Who's that?  I don't know.  All right.  What are you getting on TV for?  I don't know.  We're suspects in the Vince McMahon murder.  Yeah.  Might as well blame us for that, too.  All right, Taz.  We'll see you Saturday.  Jones Beach.  All right?  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Always a pleasure.  All right, Taz.  Take care, guys.  Well, Taz really does not care less.  Huh?  He could give a crap about Vince. 
[01:04:30]  He just wants to know where his paycheck is coming from.  But O&A traveling virus, Saturday, four days away.  We can't wait.  You got the tailgating.  Then you go into the O&A village and check out all sorts of stuff, including a video confessional.  We got a karaoke thing happening.  We got that crazy clown that you get to dunk.  You got the O&A pest booth.  Are the $10 tickets still happening?  Are they done?  They are done.  Done.  Man, you missed your shot, stupid.  Then Pal Talk's going to be there in the O&A village.  All the sponsors are going to be doing their thing. 
[01:05:00]  Pal Talk's going to be backstage, too.  Going to have exclusive backstage access.  I guess the headline today is if you're going to Jones Beach Saturday, get there early because, you know, it's an all-day thing.  And then you got eight or nine comedians.  I keep saying eight or nine because I've lost track.  Bob Kelly, Bob Saget, Frank Caliendo, Jim Norton, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, Stephen Lynch.  Oh, $70 for whatever.  Okay.  That's all the ticket prices.  Oh, speaking of...  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  You can get all your tickets through Ticketmaster for Saturday's show at Jones Beach. 
[01:05:30]  Yes, Anthony.  Speaking of Pal Talk, Red Room just got into the shower.  We have shower cam up.  And the shower cam is completely level with the area in question.  That's a nice area.  I got to be honest, Red Room has a very nice body, but why did she, like, destroy that whole area with all sorts of tattoos?  Some guys like the tats, some guys don't.  I'm not big on the tats like that.  Are you a big fan of the tats?  No, no, I'm not. 
[01:06:00]  Like, I don't understand the women that have a really nice set of breast...  Yeah.  And then they, like, F it up with a big, huge tattoo on one of them?  Uh-huh.  Jimmy, are you into the tats like that?  Not necessarily, but she looks good.  Her hiney right now on camera is wonderful.  But her tramp stamp is too big.  She's a tats.  She's like a wild chick.  Yeah, she's got a bunch of tats, so she likes...  And Red Room, no disrespect.  You're beautiful.  I'm just not a fan of the big tats around the area. 
[01:06:30]  I'm not either, but she's just sexy.  So, like, she's, like, it just, it works for her because she's, like, a dirty, like, you know, just a dirty, sexy, naughty girl.  She's not.  She's a mom now, Jimmy.  You can't say that to her.  So what?  She's probably, she's naked on a camera, showering.  Tell you one thing.  She got her body right back into shape, huh?  Yeah.  Look at that.  She's shampooing her hair.  Ooh, look at it.  Look how the soapy water runs down.  She spun around where we could see her back.  And she's rinsing her hair and the bubbles from the shampoo, they're cascading. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, can I, it's an apple ass.  Is this interactive?  Can she hear us right now?  I'm not, I'm not sure.  I want her to go for the soap scoop.  What's the soap scoop?  You know, the soap scoop.  What, underneath?  The undercarriage?  Get a nice soapy, you know, and then, oh, she might be going for the soap scoop.  And you've got to wash the, um...  The old soap scoop.  No?  No, she's still on the hair product.  Girls take so long in the shower, don't they?  My girlfriend's the worst.  Really?  It'll be 7.30, we'll have to leave at 8, we both have to shower. 
[01:07:30]  It's like, hey, selfish, it's 7.52.  Can I get in there?  Hey, selfish.  She's got to dry her hair.  Hurry up.  Take 10 minutes and I'll take 10 minutes.  God almighty, what are you doing in there?  Reliving the womb experience?  Get out.  Well, that's lovely.  That's on Pal Talk right now.  I don't think you're made for a living girlfriend, Jim.  Yeah.  I don't know how it's ever going to work out with you two.  And we love her.  I do, too.  I mean, I get along with her well, considering she's looking for an apartment now because she 
[01:08:00]  wants to move, but we're not ready to live together.  But she's there a lot.  She's there a lot.  But no, she wants to get, I want to help her get her own apartment.  Like, she still has one, but she wants to be closer.  Set her up like a guma?  Yeah.  Like, I'm trying to find her a place in Manhattan.  I want to find her a two-bedroom in Midtown for under $800 a month.  If anybody has any type of an insight into that.  Why a two-bedroom?  Just so I can, in case I want to come over and not be bothered. 
[01:08:30]  Like, say I want to go in the other room and look at porn on the laptop.  I go, stay in there.  I'll be in the veranda room overlooking the Time Warner building.  Ooh.  Soap is running down her belly button and then down the front continues and goes into a little  river.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a river, all right.  Hey, Jared, Boston, what's up?  Hey, boys, you may have done this yesterday by now because of the Boston delay, but I was  wondering if you could play the three-time trampoline Iron Sheik going into a break.  Could the Iron Sheik have been a suspect? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I think so.  Vince McMahon's always been a patriot.  Right, of course.  And the Iron Sheik is on the other side of that fence.  Vince loves America.  We under...  I get it!  All right.  Oh, wow, that was a good franca.  It certainly was.  Had volume, had LR rolls.  A lot of R rolling.  Had pizzazz.  Hey, after the break, we got Adam Ferrara.  Hey, Adam's here, my pal.  Also, I'm going to finally explain the ending to The Soprano.  Finally.  David Chase is brilliant.  I was privy to an email.  They went out to about seven people. 
[01:09:30]  Unfortunately, three of them are in this room.  I'm going to reserve judgment on his brilliance and try to hear your explanation.  And let's not get distracted.  I want to read this next, okay?  As we go to break, a little Iron Sheik.  What do you think?  Iron Sheik.  Iron Sheik, playing Madison Square Garden.  Is this a longer one?  A minute.  How long is this?  A minute.  A minute.  For the newbies.  Iron Sheik came on.  He was a really god-awful interview.  He was hysterical.  The guy couldn't speak. 
[01:10:00]  But the beauty of him is we wanted him to just say that he is Iron Sheik and he's listening  to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, you know the things you hear when celebrities say, hey, this is blah, blah, blah, and you're  listening to blah, blah, blah.  We wanted the Iron Sheik to do one for our show.  So we went into the studio to do it.  And he just, he couldn't get it right.  He was going on and on and on.  Also, just babbling.  Right.  Babbling.  And this is what we got out of him.  Oh, by the way, this is like 20 minutes.  This is just a short version.  Oh, yeah.  It went on and on and on forever. 
[01:10:30]  But here's the Iron Sheik.  Just trying to say that he's the Iron Sheik and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is the Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  Pleasure for me today.  Anthony and Opie bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans and everybody know I'm the real Middle Easter man.  come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world, Manhattan, Madison, 
[01:11:00]  Sierra Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American and also my Iranian friend.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans and all my wrestling fans.  Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to talk to the Opie and Anthony and pleasure for me always. 
[01:11:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  These sex scenes for himself.  It's unbelievable.  God bless him.  With his sex faces.  I want to be on Rescue Me.  I want to pitch a character called Jim the Firebug.  I'm not a really good actor, so I don't want to do any dialogue.  I just want to light a fire and then smile wryly and then run off the camera.  That would be cool.  Jim the Firebug. 
[01:12:00]  They push you in on your face with that big smile with this music playing.  Rescue Me is one of the best shows on TV.  Yeah, it's really good.  It really is.  It's really good.  The fires like we were talking about during the break, Adam.  Yeah, there was a lot of fires this season.  But, I mean, just so believable.  Usually when you see, you know, a fire on a TV show, it's like, eh, you kind of see  how controlled it is and stuff.  But the fires in Rescue Me just look like they're completely out of control.  They actually, we did one up in Harlem in the middle of the night. 
[01:12:30]  We blew up this building and the fire comes shooting out.  They're real fire trucks.  This guy, Nils, drives the big fire truck.  And I play chief in this other house, so I ride in a little car.  Yeah.  And it's a real fireman just tear ass around this in the Binda Giant truck.  And I'm looking over and Daniel Sinjata's driving the truck I'm in.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  You're an actor.  Can you handle this?  Because I just picture him driving over the side and we follow the fires in.  And the fires blow out.  And it's really, it's a lot of fun.  It's all real.  I just can't wait for Rescue Me.  How much permits do you have to get to start a building fire in New York? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, right?  Yeah, up there.  It's amazing.  They block off streets and everything.  New York is weird.  You can't do anything without a permit unless you're, like, filming a TV show or a movie.  Then it's like, ah, do whatever you want.  Then you can get the permits.  But, like, if you want to do anything, like, if we wanted to do, we wanted to do, like,  some bits out on the street.  Yeah.  There have been plenty of times.  Some dumb thing.  And we hear, like, no, you can't do that.  They won't allow you to do that.  Well, do we need a permit?  Yeah, but you'd never get a permit to grant, you know, the use of a bullhorn.  Yeah, but we just want.  Oh, a bullhorn. 
[01:13:30]  We just want to do a bullhorn right in front of 20 people.  Oh, wow.  We're filming a movie.  Look, we want to light 57th Street on fire for 10 blocks and then fly a jet fighter right  down the middle of it and crash it into the Queensborough Bridge.  Perfect.  How's Tuesday?  And Dennis Lurie will be having sex in the middle of the fire.  We got thrown at a Walt Whitman Mall trying to film stuff with a video camera about 35  years ago.  Yeah.  Oh, we were at the forefront of that whole thing.  We were at the forefront of YouTube, but there was no place to put it. 
[01:14:00]  No YouTube.  We would go around just goofing on people in the mall.  That's what's so frustrating about jackass.  We all were doing jackass.  I know.  We were smart enough to, like, actually distribute it to people.  Yeah.  And there was no outlet, you know?  There was no outlet aside from public access cable.  That's it.  We read in the paper in, like, the parade section on Sunday.  Yeah.  On Newsday.  Public access.  Public access.  So we're like, all right, what do we need?  Yeah.  A camera.  Get your uncle's camera. 
[01:14:30]  I got my uncle's camera and I walked in like Gleason.  All right, pal.  We're making a TV.  Pretty much it.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Call Joe Buck.  We need a sound guy.  Yeah.  And we videotaped a bunch of stuff.  And for some reason, we weren't able to get it on public access cable.  Nah.  Who has all these videotapes?  I don't know where the hell they ended up.  You might have them.  You guys got to find those.  Unless DX threw them in the fireplace with everything else.  With all our radio awards.  Yeah.  My big radio awards.  I had one that was shaped like an oldie time radio. 
[01:15:00]  Right.  Oh, like a big.  I must have clogged the flow up really nice with the plastic melting.  That's healthy for a chimney.  Long with my clothes.  That went to goodwill.  That's some twisted stuff, man.  Burning your stuff.  Burning my awards.  Like important stuff, too.  Yeah.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Ah, what are you going to do?  In a little while, I just saw a glimpse of this.  We're trying to save the strippers in Ohio?  Save what?  We're trying to save strippers in Ohio.  Are they endangered?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Have they swam up a river and the Coast Guard's trying to push them back into the river? 
[01:15:30]  They need to get back in the salt water.  They'll drown.  What's wrong with the strippers?  I don't know.  We're going to find out in a few minutes, Jimmy.  I don't know.  I just saw something about an email.  There's an organization.  They're trying to save strippers in Ohio, and they want our help.  Why?  Are they too dumb?  They don't know how to eat?  They're just looking at food, and they keep trying to put it in their ears and their  noses?  Like, cinnamon.  No, stupid.  Eat it.  The only reason...  Cinnamon forgot to exhale.  We've been teasing this email I got.  That's why we can't do the stripper thing right now, because the listeners are going to 
[01:16:00]  kill us.  They will.  And then we'll talk to Adam about Rescue Me and Season 4.  Adam, you watched The Sopranos?  I did, yeah.  What did you think of the ending?  He got me.  I thought my cable went out.  I was screaming.  Yeah, I was one of those guys.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  No, I knew the cable didn't go out.  I just went...  The first words out of my mouth right when it went black was, you gotta be...  Yeah.  ...ing me.  The whole thing was building.  I mean, the weather...  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, don't stop me.  He's going to get no...  Here it comes, yeah.  He killed the front of his dog.  Believe in!  And bang! 
[01:16:30]  And then all you hear was me cursing.  It's like, what the...  You gotta be kidding me.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  David Chase is brilliant, Adam.  Yeah.  We were yelling and screaming yesterday, but I'm privy to an email.  Oh, yeah?  Only seven of us got this email across America, and I'm one of the people that got it.  You and six strippers in Ohio.  Well, then again, Anthony also got it, and thanks.  Of course.  But then there's another four people out there that also is privy to this email I'm about  to read to you.  Okay.  Sopranos final scene theory.  Go ahead.  David Chase is brilliant. 
[01:17:00]  Tony was killed.  Really?  The end.  Wow.  You're going to have to explain a little further than that.  The end.  A little further.  Well, this email I got explaining the final scene.  Tony was killed.  In fact, the ending was genius if you paid attention to the show or are just a fan of  well-developed, well-thought-out plots that all tie together and have the memory of a  champ to remember it all. 
[01:17:30]  So you gotta remember past episodes, and then you realize that David Chase is brilliant.  Well, that's easy to remember past episodes when each season was a year and a half in between.  A year and a half.  Three years.  Three years.  Between five and six.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  The ending was simple.  He got killed.  But let me tell you why.  And this person doesn't give his name.  He might be an inside source.  It might even be David Chase himself giving me a whole email overnight.  Was that from JamesG at Yahoo.com?  James G. 
[01:18:00]  Gandolfini.  There I know.  The ending was simple.  He got killed.  But let me tell you why and explain the detail.  There were three people in the room total who had a reason to kill Tony in that diner.  Oh.  The two black guys.  Right.  They were paid before to kill Tony, but he was only shot in the ear.  This was in one of the earlier seasons.  Uh-huh.  Do you remember that?  Anyone?  No.  Sure.  I remember that.  Do you really remember?  Yeah.  Maybe people can help us on the phone lines.  What about the guy in the members only jacket? 
[01:18:30]  We're getting there.  We're getting there.  He was very important, too.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  This was in one of the earlier seasons.  The black guys, uh, trying to kill Tony, but they only shot his ear.  Were they the two guys?  Uh, this.  Okay.  Okay.  You follow me so far?  I'm with you.  Then the camera switches back to Tony's face.  Then it once again switches to his perspective, and it shows him looking at the door and looking  at the people coming in.  Okay?  Every time the door opens, the chimes sound.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  Carmella walks in. 
[01:19:00]  Chimes.  AJ walks in.  Chimes.  Uh, uh, this when Meadow...  Oh, okay.  And this is all happening when, uh, Meadow is trying to parallel park.  Trying to park her car.  Very exciting.  Three minutes left in the episode, and she's parallel parking on it.  Yeah.  Uh, and she's still trying to get into the restaurant.  Okay.  At this point, the camera switches back to the trucker who goes in the bathroom.  Right.  Then it goes to a scene where Meadow finally parks and starts running into the diner, right?  Mm-hmm.  The door's about to open.  Tony looks up, and no chimes! 
[01:19:30]  Meaning he's not looking up at someone entering the diner.  No music.  Everything just goes black.  I thought I heard chimes.  Yeah, me too.  I remember hearing chimes at the end when, uh, when Meadow, supposedly it was Meadow that  walked in.  According to the secret email, no chimes.  Maybe the guy's sound was off.  He was looking, he was looking up, and you're, you're assuming he's looking up because Meadow 
[01:20:00]  is at the diner.  I remember chimes.  I remember the chimes, and I remember...  You don't remember chimes.  Yes, I do.  I remember chimes.  I remember chimes, and I remember Sollozzo sitting there and him leaning over saying,  I'm going to speak Italian to Michael.  Got good Italian food here.  I have the dumbest question McCluskey could have asked.  McCluskey's a dope.  Is there going Italian food in his face?  McCluskey's a big dope.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Well, here's the...  No music, everything just goes black.  Uh, hold on, Jimmy.  The going black part is actually an interesting point.  Oh.  Because someone I, someone I talked to last night said that it was actually a lot of, one 
[01:20:30]  thing I liked about the last scene, although I found it to be an anticlimax, was that it  did show you Tony's paranoia, like, that's probably how he lives all the time.  Sure.  Looking, which would be interesting in a regular episode.  Now, right, that's the explanation I heard, is that all that tension, all that paranoia,  all the, oh my God, he's going to be shot.  Who is that guy?  What is that?  Oh, that doesn't look good.  That goes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That all is Tony's vision of the world.  That's his life.  And it gave you insight on how he lives his life day to day, constantly under this threat, 
[01:21:00]  the paranoia, and all that.  However, if these guys are who this guy says they are, then that's a very interesting point,  too.  Chase could have been doing that as a goof, or he could have been doing that like there's  three possible murder suspects in here.  And then Tony just looks up, he has a weird face, and it's black.  Why would they all three be there?  It could be a way to symbolize that Tony will never be away from his past, like his past  will always be there, and blah, blah, blah.  Well, let me.  Well, we're not going to be able to hear the jingle. 
[01:21:30]  Well, hold on.  Let me finish the secret email I got overnight.  Okay.  So, no chimes, no music, everything just goes black, okay?  In one of the early episodes of The Sopranos, Tony's talking with Bobby about what it must  feel like to die.  Yeah.  Bobby says at the end, you probably don't hear anything, everything just goes black.  Right.  You remember that, right?  Yeah.  Part of that was revisited in the second to last episode during the last seconds of it  when Tony's about to go to sleep, and he flashes back to the memory of him and Bobby  on the boat.  You probably don't hear anything, everything just goes black. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  So, in the end, the Journey song was playing, the chimes on the door sounded, but when Meadow  came in, the guy in the trucker hat came out and killed Tony.  Tony, it's the reason you ain't here or C.S. when he died.  It was from his perspective, and everything went black, then the credits rolled.  My only problem is where they synced up the music perfectly then.  See, why was the music synced up perfectly?  Stop it!  You understand?  Like, who dies on a music cue? 
[01:22:30]  Who dies on a perfect music?  I would buy that more if it was in mid-lyric, like in the middle of another line.  Mm-hmm.  All right, let's go to the phone.  Yeah, and you do hear the chimes.  You hear the chimes.  And the guy can't come out of the bathroom and kill him, because he would have been shot  in the side of the head.  He wouldn't have looked up.  Yeah, he wouldn't have looked up.  He looked up straight at the door when he walked in.  Oh, that email is crap all up.  It is.  If you read it backwards, you hear Paul is dead.  Paul is dead.  I am the walrus.  What happened?  Play the last 15 seconds, Hawk, and play it now.  All right. 
[01:23:00]  Actually, act it out, Hawk.  Here we go.  Here's Meadow, going into the diner.  She's running toward the diner.  Don't stop.  There's the chimes.  Rip that piece of crap up.  No chimes, dude.  Did you notice?  There was no chimes.  That's freaking odd.  Yeah, it was part of the chimes, because then he got killed before the second part of  the chimes.  Then again.  All right, let's go to the phone.  Wait a minute. 
[01:23:30]  Meadow shot him.  Hold on, Jimmy's.  Oh, I ripped up the wrong thing.  Oops.  What was that?  That was the David Chase interview.  I got that.  That stunk.  No, that email had more value than that stupid interview.  Oops.  Here it is, sweetie.  I got Chase interview.  Fine.  Is there a difference in the time between the chimes?  Like, the chime, a half a second before it goes black.  Now, with the other ones, how long, I want somebody to watch this, when like AJ and his  dumb wife walk in, how long before, like, when he looks up at the chimes, do they take 
[01:24:00]  you to get to the table?  Like, would the chime happen a half second later, him see her?  Maybe he was getting killed as she was walking through the door.  Well, of course that could have happened, but you know something?  Nothing happened, because it's a fake show, and they didn't end it.  So anything could happen.  He could have stood up, had no pants on, and Carmella could have given him treats right  there in the diner.  That's as logical as anything else.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's up? 
[01:24:30]  Do you guys remember that episode where Tony got shot by a black guy?  He gets shot, and he killed those guys.  Those guys aren't around to kill him later on.  Yeah.  So that's number two.  Blow your nose on that email.  They're dead.  Oh, man.  I thought I had a great secret email.  Here's why we all want to be different.  None of us want to feel like we waited that long for that.  We don't want to feel ripped off.  We're trying to find some type of an ending that we can go, oh, yes, it was as great as 
[01:25:00]  I had hoped.  We got ripped off.  And he wasn't good, and he's in France where he belongs.  How great would it be?  I think the repeat is on tonight, and they have an actual ending.  Oh, same ending.  Brilliant.  That would be brilliant.  That he'd be a genius.  Let's say hi to Brian on Longstreet's ending.  How would they do something like that?  We get the whole country talking.  Or no, HBO blew an opportunity.  They could have had a missing scene there and then made everyone go to HBO.com or something  for the actual ending.  They could have really had fun with this. 
[01:25:30]  Brian, what's up?  Hey, you know, they already debunked the whole Nicky Leotardo theory, too, because the local  paper where the actor is from did a story on him, and they confirmed that he's never  been on Sopranos before, and it was a one-time only role as a mystery man.  He's never been on.  That's the worst email you could have gotten.  That is like one of those.  Did you like that?  Did you make that up?  That was from Steve at FoundryMusic.com.  It's all true.  I read it.  I've screened this myself. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, wait.  John?  I read till my eyebrows fell out.  Yeah, what happened?  Wow.  All right, we'll talk about that.  We'll get your take on the whole thing.  Yeah, he's creeping everyone out, but first, John, because I went to him.  Hold that thought.  John, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing, O?  Yeah, go ahead, John.  Yeah, listen, that chime, that wasn't a chime at the end of the show.  No, that was a symbol.  That was a symbol from the song, Don't Stop Believin'.  Ah, to confuse you a little bit.  Let's hear it again. 
[01:26:30]  Come on.  Give me that again.  Come on, John.  I hope you're all right.  Come on, O, rock.  All right.  We're playing it.  How about we play the actual song, and then you would hear if there's something at that point.  Let's hear it.  All right.  Symbol or chime?  Here we go.  Here goes, O, rock.  Speed like diesel.  Don't stop me.  Shut up.  Symbol.  What the hell kind of symbol are they using in Journey? 
[01:27:00]  It sounded like one of those at the fair where you hit the big sledgehammer and the thing goes up and hits the bell.  It's a chime.  It's the middle of the symbol.  It's the middle of the symbol.  It is not, you dummy.  It's a chime on a door.  I'm with John.  That's in the song.  Don't stop believing.  I don't want to stop believing.  I believe in this theory, man.  John, you're an ass.  John, right on, man.  It's not a chime.  It's the marbles in your head clanging around, you dumbass. 
[01:27:30]  Part of the song.  I can't believe we entertained that call.  Hey, man.  Let's go to Bob in New York.  Bob, what's up?  And we're back and listened again.  That's right.  Bob.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  He's playing a joke on us.  The first song is Vanilla Fudge, You Keep Me Hanging On.  Next scene, Tony's sitting there, and they're going, you got to listen to the music.  And the last song at the end, you got to believe, right?  He could have did, I did it my way, Sinatra.  He played that last song.  The whole joke is in song. 
[01:28:00]  So he's saying in song, go screw yourselves.  This is what I did.  I read a Chase interview.  He's not doing that.  He even said, I'm not trying to fool people.  I'm not trying to do anything like that.  He goes, I'm trying to entertain you.  And I actually believe him.  I don't think he's trying to...  He had an artistic vision that most of us just found boring and awful, unfortunately.  I think that was just his vision.  I still think there's more to that ending.  We wish that was.  That will come out in the coming days.  Yeah, yeah.  I wish you were right, bro.  But the thing I didn't like about it, it was too suspicious. 
[01:28:30]  The black guys, no.  They're there buying cake.  The trucker, no.  He's just a dumb trucker.  And the other guy was too suspicious looking.  It's not the way it works.  They wouldn't have done that.  They would have walked up and just popped him real quick.  They wouldn't have waited for his whole family to be there.  How about this?  All those people were suspicious, but Tony realized, no, they're just what you just said.  But then there's somebody else that we don't even see that kills him.  Well, how about he's killed on his way to Schenectady?  I mean, it could have been anything then.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  How about he had some pie and he was allergic to it?  He choked on an onion ring.  No.  Everyone's saying it's a symbol, not a chime.  Eric on Long Island.  I guess all the Journey fans are checking in now.  Yes, Eric.  Well, I'm not necessarily a Journey fan, but that's definitely the bell of a symbol.  No, it's not.  It is not, you dunce.  Yes, it is.  It is not.  Play the song.  You won't hear it.  Yeah, go find Don't Stop Believing and find that part of the song.  Let's go to Steve Perry on a car phone.  Steve.  What?  Bryce?  What? 
[01:29:30]  Huh?  Who the...  What?  Why are we...  What?  What do you got now?  I don't know.  A secret text?  That's some footage of Opie and Anthony.  What is that about?  What did we do?  You know what I love, by the way?  What?  You know, I see people.  See people.  I see people.  And because...  I guess we could say this much.  The news is showing footage of us from, I think, 1987.  Yeah.  You riding on a razor screw?  Yeah.  And then people will look up to me and go, wow, are you sick? 
[01:30:00]  Are you tired?  I'm like, no, you ass.  You're looking at footage from, like, eight years ago.  Eight years ago?  That's great.  What happened?  What happened?  You all right?  You feeling okay?  Your goatee's kind of going gray overnight.  Yeah.  Isn't it?  Overnight, eight years, you dummy.  And I just chopped my ponytail off.  Let's go to Tyler.  Tyler. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I think that there's a chime earlier in the show when AJ comes in.  I don't think that there's actual, that that's a symbol in a stupid song.  Of course it's not.  Why don't we hear one of the earlier chimes and see if it's that?  Yeah.  E-Rock?  E-Rock?  We can match it up.  Oh, let's go with this theory.  Eddie in the Bronx.  Eddie.  Hey, what's up, bro?  Hey.  Okay.  Let me ask you guys something. 
[01:31:00]  Did anybody ever realize that in the show, Tony had two different shirts on?  When?  In the diner or restaurant?  Let me tell you.  When I looked in the newspaper, right, they showed him with a short-sleeved shirt on, right?  Yeah.  But it's weird.  In the show, he had on like a gray and black shirt while he was playing with the jukebox.  Wait, he has two different shirts on in the diner?  I don't know if he, if David Chase used bits and pieces or what have you, but I realized 
[01:31:30]  that, you know, what was he thinking when he had two different shirts on?  I'm telling you.  You may have to see it again, but I know he had a gray and black shirt on.  He has two shirts on, different shirts on in the diner?  That's right.  He had, in the newspaper, it shows him with like a short-sleeved shirt, an old little  colorful shirt.  But I remember that when he was playing with the music, he had, you know, a gray and black 
[01:32:00]  shirt on.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Here's what we have to do.  See, this would be huge news.  Oh, my goodness.  We would have to call Royals.  Well, if I was looking, I realized Mary Magdalene was really Jesus' wife.  Yes.  I've heard that.  All right.  Eric has the matched up.  Eric has the chime.  All right.  Let's hear the Journey song with the cymbal.  Let's do the TV thing first.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I guess it's your show.  Sure.  It's the Eric and Nagel show.  Why not? 
[01:32:30]  Directed by E-Roc.  What do I know at this point?  Yeah.  All right.  That's a cowbell.  That was ding.  I'm going with a cowbell.  You heard the door open and hit the ding.  It's so ridiculous.  Now you got the actual song.  All right.  Let's go.  Oh, it's in the song. 
[01:33:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Here it comes.  Don't stop.  It's in there, but it's not the part of the song.  It's a ride cymbal.  David Chase is brilliant.  There's no chime.  It's in the song.  I'm completely convinced.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  It's lined up with the cymbal in the song.  Why would they do that?  Why would they line it up?  Go to the part where either...  There's no reason for him to line it up.  Carmella or AJ comes in, and let me hear what that bell sounds like. 
[01:33:30]  They just raised that in the mix a little bit to make sure you're understanding what's  going on here, man.  They went back and found the masters of that journey set.  Right.  Absolutely.  And they remixed it on classic albums and gave it to David James.  That's right.  Of course.  Okay.  Eric, I can't see it.  E-Rock is under some severe pressure.  There is no music with Carmella.  I don't care.  I want to hear what the chime sounds like.  Jesus.  Oh, he's not going to be able to figure this out.  He's sweet.  Let's see.  That's it.  It's the same goddamn chime. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Listen when Carmella walks in.  But no.  We played just a song.  There's a cymbal or something.  Listen.  Listen.  Here she comes in the door.  And that's before the song started.  They don't go ding, dan, dan.  The song doesn't start with a chime.  David Chase.  That's the same goddamn bell.  If David Chase is listening, and I know he is, I apologize for all the things I said  yesterday and how hacky you were.  No, you don't.  And all that.  I think you're brilliant. 
[01:34:30]  He obviously found a chime or a cymbal that sounds very similar to the one in the song  to really trick us and throw us off.  Really throw us off.  When you listen to Helter Skelter, you think the Beatles are talking to you?  Absolutely.  Okay.  Someone's actually saying you can see the killer reflected in Tony's eyes.  All right.  All right.  E-Rock.  Oh.  That frame.  Yes.  Wait.  Wait.  Enhance.  Wait.  Where's that?  Enhance.  Enhance.  Wait.  I saw it on PalTalk Discussion. 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  What do they know?  That was Red Room's camera, and that wasn't a sideway mouth.  That wasn't.  All right.  We got more theories.  People are going nuts.  I saw two different shirts, too.  We're into the two different shirt theory after the break.  No, he's got a short sleeve.  I just saw it.  He's wearing one shirt.  Huh?  Now, where's the...  Go ahead.  Let it play, E-Rock.  He's wearing one shirt.  It's a short sleeve shirt.  Where's the long sleeve come in?  All right.  Well, we're going to have to wait four minutes.  Keep...  Fast forward. 
[01:35:30]  Fast forward.  Let's go.  Fast forward, E-Rock, before I bite you.  One shirt.  One shirt.  One shirt.  It's the same shirt.  One shirt.  One shirt.  Oh, we're going to keep going.  Nobody would make that consistency error in post.  One shirt.  One shirt.  One shirt.  Same shirt.  Now, it's short sleeve.  I see it.  Why does she park for an hour?  We don't see it.  Yeah.  He's wearing the same goddamn shirt.  Short sleeve.  It's a nice shirt.  Yeah.  Short sleeve. 
[01:36:00]  That's a Van Heusen, I think.  Short sleeve.  The whole thing was just about him being with his family in the end and still being paranoid.  Look at you.  Yeah, that's what I think.  Short sleeve.  See?  Long sleeve.  Back to short sleeve.  I see it.  Don't stop ding.  I have to see it.  Enough.  Enough.  I'm done with it.  I'm so done with it.  I understand what happened.  Yeah.  Nothing.  That's it.  There's no chime, though.  That was in the song.  No, it wasn't.  It's the exact same chime. 
[01:36:30]  It was.  It's the exact same chime.  We proved.  As when Carmelo walked in.  We so proved it.  That's what we proved.  Get us a forensic sound guy that can.  Here we go.  Denise in Jersey.  Denise.  Hi.  Hey.  Yeah, the three Boy Scouts in the diner that are sitting there are the three Boy Scouts  that were in the train shop when Bobby got shot.  All right.  I'm going with a ghost theory.  I just came up with a ghost theory.  The diner's heaven. 
[01:37:00]  It's filled with dead people from past episodes.  The two black eyes.  Why would they be in heaven?  Or hell.  Wherever.  Wherever the hell you go.  There's no service in heaven.  Yeah.  My onion rings are so fattening.  God wouldn't allow that.  I'm going.  I'm going with.  He was dead the entire series.  Oh.  Like Tony's sitting there, but he's not there.  Well, the whole family would have to be dead.  No.  The rest of the family is having a little dinner.  Maybe thinking about Tony.  And Tony's there, but he's not there. 
[01:37:30]  Where's the Boy Scouts?  They were in the booth.  They're in the booth with the guy.  Yeah.  In the corner, right?  I don't know.  I read that, too, but I'm not willing to believe it unless I see it.  And what about him checking out the song, Who Will You Run To?  Who Will You Run To?  Iraq, go to the Bobby Bacala getting shot footage that was probably on YouTube.  All right.  Search that and see if the Boy Scouts are in there.  Yeah.  And also, where's the Boy Scouts from the one we were just watching? 
[01:38:00]  Why do people think Anthony's totally right?  Christine.  Because people love me.  He's Italian.  Is that it?  Yeah, I'm Italian.  I love that shirt.  Is that a Van Heusen?  They despise me.  Van Heusen.  That's true.  It's true.  Christine.  Let's get him a Van Heusen.  Christine, go ahead.  Christine.  From Gertz.  Hi, Christine.  Hi.  I love you guys.  Anthony, you are so right.  My husband's in a Journey tribute band for the past a million years.  I think he's even played with your brother.  Of course he has.  I've heard that song, I don't want to say how many times. 
[01:38:30]  That chime is not in that part of the song.  It is totally the doorbell.  Oh, my God.  You're crazy.  You're crazy.  We just played the actual Journey song.  There is something in that part of the song.  But it's not the chime.  It's a ride symbol.  No.  The chime doesn't come in at that time.  And it's not even exactly the same.  We played the actual Journey song.  We played the final scene and then we took an actual CD of Journey and played that part  of the song and we heard something exactly right there.  It's not exactly like it.  It's not the chime.  Right.  It's not the same bell. 
[01:39:00]  It's a doorbell.  Haven't you heard that song a thousand times, Opie, that you would know that that big loud  bing doesn't come in there?  Why are you blowing up my spot?  Are you going to tell me there's no Santa Claus now, too?  I'm looking at Bobby Bacala getting shot.  I want to see if there's Boy Scouts.  I know there were children that were cowering when it happened.  Is one of the killers the one that shot Bacala?  But I don't, I'm not sure if there's Boy Scouts or something.  Yeah, this is, uh.  Ah, that train.  I'm going to go for it.  Yeah, that train. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Oh, going around the train.  He's going to buy a little choo-choo train.  Oh, here we go.  The train scene.  And he winds up laying on the table.  Ah, excuse me.  That's the same guy from the diner.  Go backwards.  Which guy?  No.  Go backwards.  Now watch.  Wait, hold on.  Watch, watch.  After it goes through, these two guys walk in right about.  No, you didn't go back far enough.  Dane Cook shot Bacala?  I want to see the Boy Scouts if they're in there.  You'll see them hovered on the floor after he gets there.  Yeah.  Wait, watch this, though. 
[01:40:00]  Well.  Eric, those are not real people.  Those are little mannequins.  Watch the two guys walk in.  The one guy looks like one of the guys that walked into the diner, right?  Yeah, see?  No.  No, he's not.  Keep going.  What is that?  Just keep going.  I hope it's time for this conspiracy theory.  Hey, man, you got to love conspiracy theories.  It ain't working, though.  Oh, Bobby.  Why?  There he goes.  Did anyone else notice that the killer looks like Dane Cook?  He does.  All right.  Bobby's getting all shot. 
[01:40:30]  The train's going around the track.  There he goes on the table.  The train falls on the floor.  Back.  And where are the kids?  Back and to the left.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, see?  The kids are right there.  Are they Boy Scouts?  Kids are right there.  See?  Where are they?  Right there.  Where are the kids?  I see them.  Where are the kids?  I see them.  See, right there.  He's on top.  Are they Boy Scouts?  Dummies.  They're just two kids.  They're two kids.  With a lucky older gentleman.  You know, you people are just rubes and stupid.  I believe. 
[01:41:00]  Passing around emails from someone that has these half-assed thoughts and didn't even confirm  them by actually going through the episodes and checking if they're real or not.  David Chase, I'm not going to stop believing.  I believe.  Good.  You believe.  Here's the chimes.  The one is from the original scene?  The ending scene?  The final scene?  Whatever?  Yeah, the two chimes.  It's Carmella's chime and then Meadow's chime or whatever.  All right.  Here's Carmella's chime.  Same chimes. 
[01:41:30]  So that's back-to-back.  Yeah.  Those are the two chimes.  They're the same.  I don't hear it.  Can you hear it again?  I hear it a little different.  Just a little.  Let's hear it.  It's the same exact tone.  The same chime.  No, it's a little different.  The same chime.  If you listen closely, it's a little different.  I'm going with Than's expertise because Than is a pianist and he's got a great ear for a note.  Than, wouldn't you say this is the exact same chime that is being rung? 
[01:42:00]  Yes.  And also the ride cymbal thing doesn't...  I mean, it is a ride cymbal beforehand, but it's between beats.  It doesn't make sense for that to be in the song at that point.  Exactly.  Cool.  So play it again.  Listen, it's the exact same tone, the exact same note.  Well, I think at this point we're going to have to agree to disagree.  Oh, okay.  Well, then we'll agree to disagree.  I like when a conversation reaches that point.  You know, world powers should just do that. 
[01:42:30]  At one point just go, we're just going to have to agree to disagree.  It is chime.  You do not hear it.  It is chime.  We'll agree to disagree.  Move your missiles.  Look, I don't want to be a believer, so let's just agree to disagree.  All right.  Oh, now we got...  Good.  We'll take armies back now.  Now we got an ER 104.  I don't know what the hell that means.  Been in radio a long time.  I've never seen an ER 104.  Oh.  Dude, it's a sign.  It absolutely is.  Thank you, Adam.  Finally someone on my side. 
[01:43:00]  You know, in...  I'm going to blow up my spot again.  I got this special secret email last night that I felt like sharing with you guys.  I didn't have to share.  Absolutely.  That's right.  You got Oliver Stone's cell phone number?  You guys going to chat after the show?  Oh, so different.  Agree to disagree.  If you can't hear that, I don't know what to tell you, man.  I really don't know what to tell you.  Listen, one more time. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The second one, much more pronounced.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  It's pronounced boob.  The inmate who wanted to kidnap letting his kid escape?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's an ongoing story.  Do you know, he got acquitted on the kidnapping plot, but he actually got 10 years in prison  for overcharging David Letterman on the work he was doing at his house. 
[01:44:00]  They probably knew he was guilty.  That's, uh, yeah.  Sounds like they found a loophole.  It was a little loophole there.  Talk about some, uh, you know, obviously the guy's a sicko.  Put him in prison for however long they want to.  I don't care.  If that was an actual law, half of Bayshore would be in jail for a very long time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every construction worker on Long Island is going to prison for 10 years for overcharging.  Hey, we got to take a break.  The answer is in the song, Pamela from New Hampshire.  We're going to talk to you next.  It's in the music, man. 
[01:44:30]  It absolutely is.  No, it's not.  And we blew him off yesterday.  We got to talk to him today.  Dennis Hoff from the Bunny Ranch.  Yes.  There's Nevada.  We're doing something special for the fathers there, Adam.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  We're going to get a father a date.  A date.  Yeah.  Hmm.  We'll talk about that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Sorry about that.  Meh, meh, meh.  Still getting used to the new sweepers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Locally, it sounds like, all right, punch music.  No?  It might be me.  I got to pay closer attention.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[01:45:00]  I am Ferrara in studio.  Hey, a lot of people are coming up with the two different shirt thing.  Yeah.  Yep.  And this is very interesting.  Unfortunately, it's the New York Post.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  We're still on this?  Really fast.  Front page is the New York Post.  Look at that.  Sopranos.  Sopranos fans out for blood.  Right.  I had one really pissed off at the ending of The Sopranos, right?  Look at the shirt Tony's wearing, and that's the shot from the diner, okay?  Yeah, that is a different shirt.  It's probably a read-through.  Huh?  It's probably a photo from a read-through.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, yeah, I know, but it... 
[01:45:30]  Or they said they filmed a bunch of different endings, maybe.  That's true, too.  And then you go to page six, you know, and there's Tony in the diner shot, and Carmella  has the exact same shirt on.  He has a different shirt on.  Yeah, maybe he spilt some...  Maybe he was having a little...  I'll go, rest in peace.  Maybe he had some...  I ain't the God.  I didn't mean no...  He got a little managot on it.  It's a managot.  Whatever it means, it is there.  There are two different shirts in the paper today for the same scene. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, it was probably a shot from a read-through.  Probably a read-through or something like that, or he was having his shirt maybe spilt  something, or he was having it pressed.  Yes.  Why don't you just tell me there's no Easter Bunny, Jimmy, while you're at it?  There's no Easter Bunny.  Why would I lie?  He hops around in April, and there's also a sandman who sprinkles sand into my eyes.  David Chase told us, don't stop believing, and I want to keep believing, so stop.  Nice.  All right.  I believe he's an anticlimactic ass, and I'll continue to believe that.  He's an artsy-fartsy dullard. 
[01:46:30]  I should have just said no to HBO.  One more before we move on to Dennis Hoffer who's on the line.  Mark in Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Maybe he was just dead ever since he got shot with Junior.  There you go.  This is all a dream.  Well, if he was dead, how would he dream?  That's what I'm going with now.  That's my new one.  I like that one even better than the chime theory.  Yeah, he's been dead.  I thought the Uncle Junior stuff was great.  That was a really good scene.  Junior.  Him and Junior, yeah, with no teeth. 
[01:47:00]  I got that turn in his eye, too.  That's a mess of me.  I'll be like, whoa.  Yeah, all right.  Thank you, Mark.  Let's go to Pamela in New Hampshire.  Pamela?  They're not going to kill their cash cow, and there's a line in the song that says,  the movie goes on and on and on.  They're going to make a freaking movie.  Do you realize I say that?  Oh, my God.  So, Journey wrote the song knowing that the Sopranos were going to use it 25 years later.  Ha-ha!  Hey, Steve Perry's been in on it since the beginning.  Yep.  Even though he doesn't sing for Journey anymore. 
[01:47:30]  That's why they didn't use it.  No, miss.  I like it.  People want to believe.  It's a good theory, though.  He didn't think it through.  He just wanted to show you.  All right, you talk.  Why would I mean chime in?  Go ahead right away.  I apologize.  Don't say chime.  Go ahead, miss.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to talk.  Go ahead.  You go.  It's all about you.  Go.  Don't stop believing because he doesn't want you to stop believing in Tony.  Yeah.  Okay, that was worth interrupting me for.  I appreciate it.  Anything else you want to chime in with while I sit here?  No, but seriously, my cousin is a boom operator on the set.  Mm-hmm.  And he told me exactly what Chase was thinking. 
[01:48:00]  What was he thinking?  Really?  Yeah, the boom operator gets all the information.  Yeah, that's it.  He's got the spoon.  The boom operator is the guy that also goes out and gets the sandwiches.  You guys need to open your mind.  She might be giving us everything right now, but you don't want to acknowledge it because  it's coming from a boom guy.  And a brook.  Kind of like when you see a crazy homeless guy on the street and he says he's Jesus Christ.  He just might be.  Go ahead, miss.  But we're not paying attention to him because he's homeless.  Miss, what did the boom guy say?  Yeah.  Let's go. 
[01:48:30]  First of all, there were no alternate endings taped.  What happened was that they were taping the same scene on a particular day and Tony did  have on another shirt and somebody's already gotten flack for that because the person who  was going through in the editing room was supposed to notice that and didn't.  Because Frank Vincent, because Frank Vincent, who is an actor on the program, actually said  there were alternate endings done and he was filming different.  Yeah, but that's just Frank Vincent.  That's not a boom guy.  Okay.  Then what did the boom guy say?  What happened was you see Meadow. 
[01:49:00]  He's building up the suspense with Meadow trying to park her car, trying to park her car.  The guy goes in the back room.  And when the door opens, Tony looks up and...  And?  Oh, no.  Oh, she got us really good.  That's a great gag.  But everybody knows she's lying.  That's a good gag.  Here's how I know.  And then she hung up.  No.  First of all, she's a Boston liar.  We sat there quiet waiting for her.  Because we really thought she might have some inside scoop for the boom guy. 
[01:49:30]  I felt exactly like I was watching the show again.  I was sitting there and going, and...  Wait, wait, what?  And what?  And then what?  Did Opie hang up on what happened?  She's a liar.  Here's why.  Okay.  Because she's saying things like, yeah, the guy in the editing got crap.  Really?  Did the boom guy help edit?  And what editor?  These shirts are not close.  Yeah.  The one Gandolfini has on in the paper is like a blue one with like sails on it.  It's like something a retarded kid wears to camp.  And then the one on the show is black.  It's completely different.  This is real mafioso.  And by the way, there's an entire wardrobe department that will never let that happen. 
[01:50:00]  Jimmy, you spoil everything that is fun.  Why don't you just tell me that it's gay if you use hand lotion?  Why don't you just tell me that too?  It's not.  It's only if you use saliva, and it's not yours.  And it belongs to a friend named Pete.  Can we move on?  Yes, please.  We have a filthy man to get to.  I'm tired of it already.  Let's say hi to Dennis Hoff.  Too funny.  What's up, Dennis?  You missed the whole thing. 
[01:50:30]  The daughter ran in there to tell him that she was going to the bunny ranch, and that she's  going to get broke in by me and Ron Jeremy.  We have a date to wrap up.  Yes, we are actually going to send a lucky gentleman out on a date with a lovely lady from the bunny  ranch.  Very excited.  We have a leader so far in this contest. 
[01:51:00]  Maybe Bear could call in, and Dennis could maybe tell him what he could expect at the  bunny ranch if he wins the Father's Day thing.  Yeah, this guy named, what the hell is his name?  Bear.  Bear.  Yes, Bear.  Is this going to be a father and son team?  Possibly.  Well, that's also a possibility.  I don't think Bear has a son.  No.  I think he has a lot of daughters.  I think if daughters should call in and tell their stories, maybe even mothers will call  in and say they cheated on their kid's father or something. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  They try to make it up to them.  It's hard to get the daughters involved.  This guy's wife is actually okay with it because they haven't had sex in 12 years, and we had  them both on the phone, and she knows where he's going for his date if he wins, and she's  okay with it, which was bizarre, but they have four girls.  But she's a real, ugh, she just won't, there's no sexuality left in this woman whatsoever.  She gives this guy no type of womanly companionship.  It's just awful. 
[01:52:00]  And for this guy to be with a beautiful woman, to be able to hang out with her and have a  lovely evening with her, will be fantastic.  Oh, that's great.  Well, you know what I'm doing is today I'm sending Brooke Taylor and Bunny Love who are  on my new series that airs this Saturday night.  They're heading to New York to help you with this.  Oh, I thought you said Bunny Love.  I thought maybe the nutty professor guy was going to sing witchcraft.  Make me an Alaskan polar bear heater. 
[01:52:30]  I didn't know he fell on such tough times.  Bunny Love.  Bunny Love.  Yeah, the girls are coming into town, but I'd like to get the daughters to call in, the  sons.  And who's deserving, I mean, what a better gift than Bunny Ranch for the Father's Day.  Oh, perfect Father's Day gift.  And you're rolling out the red carpet, as they say, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, is it that time of month for the, oh, a royalty.  Okay, now I get it.  The lady he has his date with?  Barbie?  I got a question for Dennis Hoff, because we were reading what you're giving away, which 
[01:53:00]  is amazing.  Yes.  It's a VIP treatment for two days at the Bunny Ranch, and I'm thinking after an hour  or two, what is there to do at the Bunny Ranch?  Nap and recoup.  You know, the downtime, so to speak.  Is there like a foosball machine or something?  Foosball.  Is there like one of those hockey machines and a little bar set up?  Like, what else can you do there?  Well, there's other bunnies.  And, you know, it's like a guy can barely hang around his wife for more than an hour, 
[01:53:30]  but if another new wife comes in, guess what?  He's excited.  Yeah.  Ah, see?  So he can go, you know, out on a couple of dates.  Oh, absolutely.  We want them to have a good time.  We want them to owe you guys for the rest of their life.  Yep.  You guys have a full-service bar and stuff there, right?  Yeah, 24 hours a day.  That's the beauty of Nevada.  I mean, you know, you can 24 hours a day, it's liquor, gaming, and having a good time 
[01:54:00]  with the girls.  Isn't Nevada a wonderful place?  I love it.  They put it right next to Utah just to irritate them.  All right.  You couldn't have two completely different states next to each other.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's say hi to Johnny in Brooklyn.  Johnny, you're on with Dennis Hoff from the Bunny Ranch out there in Nevada.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right, Johnny.  I'm ready to come down to the ranch.  Are you still married?  Yes, I am.  Are you a father?  Yes, I am.  How old's your kid?  Five and seven.  Five and seven and still married.  And why do you deserve to get a date at the Bunny Ranch for Father's Day? 
[01:54:30]  All righty.  I'll start with a mother of my kids having me locked up for Christmas, saying that I sexually  assaulted her when it was consensual, just the fact that she's cheating on me and she  wants me out of the picture.  Oh, she's...  Wait, your wife said you sexually assaulted her?  Her.  Yes.  On Christmas?  On Christmas.  Actually, you're making a good case for us to send you to a ranch with a lot of women.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, I'm on charges of assaulting my wife. 
[01:55:00]  On a holiday.  Yeah, where's the wife?  We need to talk to her.  Yeah.  This is a big misunderstanding, possibly.  I thought that was always a tough one, a tough sell, saying that you were sexually assaulted  if you're the wife.  Well, apparently, it happens all the time.  Wait, all right.  You're not telling us the whole story.  Yeah, well...  You got locked up for this.  You got locked up for a domestic.  So the cops came over and there was something that made them believe that maybe they should  look into this a little further.  Well, it's just, you know, just as you know, it's always the woman has always got the benefit 
[01:55:30]  of the doubt.  Yeah, if the woman says that you did it, you usually end up going.  But what did she say that made the cops arrest you?  You got some physical evidence, though.  Yeah, there's something more to this you're not telling me.  That's why the case went away, because basically there was no proof.  So it was dismissed and sealed as of last month.  But then, you know, because there was no evidence there, I mean, it was consensual.  She didn't even go to the hospital because she knew it was a lie.  So she gets you locked up on Christmas Day. 
[01:56:00]  When do you get out?  I get out the next day.  Next day.  The next day.  You're still living in the house with her?  No, I'm living with my mom now, because I try to go back, you know, after I find out  about her being with another man.  So I try to make a deal with her so she can get out of the house, you know, and try to  keep at least that.  And you know, she's not going to get remarried because she's probably collecting money from  you.  Sounds a little volatile, this guy.  Yeah, I'd say so.  Like, uh, he doesn't say, we want, we want a whole fun situation going on. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Not, uh, allegedly assaulting her.  Assault and jail.  Yeah.  The thing is, that's the killer.  I mean, I, you know, she's taking even my kids away from me.  She's having this guy even drop off my kids nowadays.  You know what I mean?  And I have...  Yeah, she does owe him, though.  She does owe him.  She should be the one calling and begging for this trip to make things right with this  guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  She had him arrested on Christmas.  Yeah.  Ha ha.  Uh, well, sorry, Johnny. 
[01:57:00]  I don't think you really fit the criteria here.  Wow.  You're going to have to go out and get your own.  What?  Yeah, let's find a...  Where do you stand with chimes, Johnny?  What?  Enough about the chimes.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, that kind of doesn't seem like the right side is in there.  No.  So, Dennis, what could the father expect when they go to the bunny ranch?  Well, what's going to happen is we're going to fly him out here, of course, and we're  going to pay for it, and then I'm going to have two or three hot bunnies waiting for  him at the airport in little short shorts and little halter tops with a big sign that 
[01:57:30]  says, opening the Anthony on it, and we're going to put him in the limo, and we're going  to drink champagne in the limo, this lucky father with the bunnies, and this is his day  to live like a rock star.  He's going to see how the guys really live, that party hard, the billionaires and the  rock stars and the rappers and all that.  So, then he gets to the ranch, and we're going to put him in a VIP suite.  We've got this special suite there that we set aside for certain people, and big shots, 
[01:58:00]  and then he gets to hang around there with the girls and eat with them.  Big shots.  Clean the ceiling.  We go to dinner, we go to clubs, eat, drink, and he's going to have the time of his  life, and the bunnies are just going to spoil the hell out of him.  He's going to be treated right.  Wow.  This guy's not going to want to leave.  He's never going to want to leave.  He's never going to want to leave.  Oh, man.  Then we're going to have him call into the show and tell Norton what a good time he's  having.  All right.  We've got Bear on the line.  Bear, you're talking to Dennis Hoff. 
[01:58:30]  He owns the Bunny Ranch.  Dennis, this guy's the front runner for the date.  Hi, Bear.  Bear.  Oh, my God.  Hey there, Bear.  Hey, Bear.  See, he's so backed up, it's in his ears.  I'm in a little trouble.  Hello.  Hey, Bear.  Oh, please.  Oh.  Hello.  Bear?  Hello, Mr. Hoff.  All right.  He's gone.  Whatever.  Where's Bear?  We're going to take more stories tomorrow, by the way, Dennis.  We got some good ones so far, and I think we're going to get the potential guys in on 
[01:59:00]  Friday, and then we're going to have the girls talk to them, and then we'll get a winner.  Yeah, we have it.  Absolutely.  You want the girls on Thursday.  They're in town waiting for you.  They're going to be partying at the Waldorf, being crazy, waiting for your call.  All right.  Good, man.  So we'll have them in on either Thursday or Friday, and we're going to determine a winner.  Bear is the front runner right now, but you never know.  We've had a couple of really good stories, so right now he's the front runner.  Oh, yes.  And real pathetic, sad sacks.  Could the girls do something a little special for Pat from Wynaki on Friday?  Oh, I think we could have some fun. 
[01:59:30]  Another sad sap that needs a little help.  Poor Pat.  They're going to have a good time there.  Believe me, these girls.  Norton, you know Brooke and Bunny.  You think these guys are going to have a good time?  Yeah, they're troopers, man.  They're the same girls that hung out at Big A, I think.  Oh, wow.  I've got to personally apologize to Dennis.  One of his girls did something for us on our show with Big A, and she ran out of the  studio crying and ended up puking in the bathroom.  We had no idea that was going to happen.  We had no idea.  That was awful.  So we're hoping that it would go a little differently with Pat from Wynaki. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  The girls yesterday said, that guy's not going to be there, is he?  These girls have seen everything.  And, of course, leave it to us on our show to get one of the girls to run out crying.  And throw up.  And it was nothing as gross as people are thinking.  It wasn't like she had anything on her, spilled on her.  It was just to say, it was something that bothered her olfactory senses.  Oh, it was a smell. 
[02:00:30]  It was a smell.  Yeah, it was a smell that she couldn't relinquish from her hand.  Oh.  And there may have been a black substance.  Oh, God.  That had nothing to do with whatever.  Just think black substance and don't think, you know, think of the fifth possible thing  that I guess it could have been.  Now, Pat from Wynaki is all different.  Yeah, we want to take care of Pat.  Maybe Pat could call the show right now.  Bear, real fast, because we've got to let Dennis Hoff go.  We've got a break coming.  Bear?  How are you guys doing? 
[02:01:00]  How are you, Dennis?  Hello, Bear.  Tell me your story quickly.  Tell you.  I have four daughters.  I have twins that are 12, 15, and 17.  Four girls.  I'm with my wife almost 18 years.  The last time me and my wife have fooled around was when I conceived the twins.  Why?  Okay?  I work, you know, I work two jobs.  I break my butt.  You know, all my friends tell me, leave.  You should get out of this, this and that. 
[02:01:30]  But I'm the type, I don't want to leave my kids.  I don't want to be a weekend father.  You know what I mean?  Take them with you.  What's that?  I wish I could.  Take them with you.  Leave this chick in the dust.  I would love to, you know?  But she's, they talk, she's out of her mind.  Yeah.  Oh, Bear, you're getting a little nervous.  Is she starting to give you crap about this whole thing?  Because we talked to her on the phone and she said that you're more than welcome to go to the bunny ranch and she would invite you back in the house after it's done.  Yeah, she really doesn't care. 
[02:02:00]  You know what?  And in a way it hurts, but you know what?  I want one that cares.  Oh, you'll forget about that.  I want one that's going to be sitting there crying.  Yeah.  You'll forget about that pain.  We got to.  Hey, Bear, write this down.  N-E-X-T.  Get rid of this broad.  That's right.  Yep.  All right, listen, Dennis, we got to go because we're late for, we're very late for a break, actually.  It's always fun.  Dennis, we'll talk to you during the week and we'll see the girls either Thursday or Friday.  And what's the, Dennis, what's the big plug?  The Cat House on?  Cat House, Saturday night, HBO.  It's our last show of the season. 
[02:02:30]  And like I said, you're going to see the Soprano daughter at the bunny ranch.  She's going to be turning parties.  Nice.  All right.  Good talking to you, man.  Bye-bye.  Bear, we'll be in touch.  There goes Bear.  There goes Dennis Hoff.  All right.  What better gift to give a guy?  There's nothing better than that.  A beautiful lady to spend some time with.  We're going to dedicate a big chunk of our show tomorrow, getting more stories from the dads.  Yep.  And the sons and the daughters they could call about their dad and why they deserve a trip to the bunny ranch for Father's Day.  The poor messes.  To have a, quote, date. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  We'll talk to Adam Farrar next about Rescue Me Season 4.  Sure.  Great.  Starts up tomorrow.  Yep.  And also this bad voiceover audition.  This is really good.  Oh, good.  Let's try to squeeze this in as well.  Get to that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Adam Farrar in studio.  Let's not forget Rescue Me starts tomorrow night on FX.  Tomorrow night.  Yes.  Yeah.  I like it.  My pal Adam plays, what do you play?  Like a sheaf? 
[02:03:30]  Sheaf needles.  Yeah.  Sheaf needles.  And they gray your hair up.  Yeah.  Because you're too fresh-faced.  You're too baby-faced.  They need me to gray.  I look like Keith Olbermann.  They gray you up a little bit.  Yeah.  But, you know, I was watching.  I'm like, wow, he's good.  Finally, like a role.  That's a good role for you.  Thank you.  Because it's not like the typical, like, Italian guy they give you.  Nah.  Usually.  I just walk in and yell at people, I'm channeling my father. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  You have a good model, a good base to work off of.  Yeah.  I like that.  I like seeing my pal on TV.  It's funny.  Yeah.  And he's going to be all over season four.  Yeah.  They're filming all sorts of scenes.  It's great.  The fire stuff is really cool.  It's really, it's a lot of fun this season, so.  Do you get to go in those fires?  Yeah.  Well, I'm the chief.  Like, I kind of stand outside and point.  You know, like a Jewish guy ordering people around the house.  Get the Italians to fix that.  Pick that up.  Do you have a white shirt?  Do you have a white shirt?  Yeah.  Ah, you're the white shirt guy.  Yeah.  You know the weirdest thing about having so many of my pals pop up on television? 
[02:04:30]  You know, you turn on Comedy Central and HBO, a bunch of comedians on there and Adam  and stuff.  When you're fooling around, you ever fooling around in bed with your chick and you're doing  things and then all of a sudden, like, one of your pals pop up on TV.  He goes, hi, pal.  And you just look and go, oh, and you've got to change the channel.  You've got to ruin the moment.  One of the worst is because every time I'm fooling around, you pop up on TV, you're in  trouble.  And that's true.  I'm concerned. 
[02:05:00]  He's got to bail out, stop and call and text you.  Now I've got to call a bail me out or something.  Yeah, we wreck sex for all our friends and family.  Awful.  At least it's all funny and stuff when you pop on.  Just one time I want to be on TV where the person seeing me on TV doesn't go, what do  they do now?  It's just so good.  What do they do this time?  It's always that, too.  It's like if the volume's down and we're on the screen, you know it's not good.  I use footage.  You're on a Razor scooter.  It's eight years ago.  I actually want to be able to smile on TV just once. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Just once.  And not make it look sarcastic or bad.  Just like being able to smile because we're happy with something we just did.  It's never a thank God for these two pieces.  Yeah, that kind of does suck.  It does suck.  By the way, Christine from Massapequa, Opie, your secret email, and she puts that in parentheses,  I was reading that same secret email at 9 p.m. last night as a MySpace bulletin. 
[02:06:00]  Wow, it got out quick.  I thought there were only eight people that got that.  Can I tell you one time, the greatest thing that's happened to me for being on TV, I did  an episode of Ed, and they were replaying it, and I was on a date in a pizza parlor,  and we look up, and I'm on television, so she looked up, and it was our first time  really hanging out.  That's cool.  Oh, it's cool.  Yeah, that was me.  Toots.  Easy, easy, toots, easy.  Worked out wonderfully.  Maybe you ran one of me as a pedophile. 
[02:06:30]  That didn't go out to well.  Yeah, I remember that one.  What was that?  Lawn on.  Lawn on?  Lawn on order.  There's my pal Adam laying in a hospital bed, playing a pedophile, and singing the  creepiest little song.  What was your song again?  It was like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star or something like that.  Yeah, and he's like tearing up, Twinkle Twinkle.  And I'm like, I'm looking at the TV going, I'm never calling him again.  Did you sing it?  He is a creep.  Yeah, I had to sing it.  Could you sing it?  No.  Could you?  No. 
[02:07:00]  Where'd you get the inspiration?  Not with that smile on your face, Jimmy.  I'll lisp and cry.  Where'd you get the inspiration?  What was your inspiration for that role?  Jim Norton.  Now believe me.  I played the Yellow Discipline CD and just channeled him.  That didn't come out of nowhere.  That was like a weird memory he had.  It had some type of someone who was like an uncle, but in parentheses, that means close  family friend, and he could slightly smell alcohol coming from one side.  And razor stubble burn on his cheek.  A lot of...  It was coarse feeling, and I thought I smelled cough medicine. 
[02:07:30]  Playing a pedophile.  Pedophile.  Yeah.  You pop up in some weird ones.  Weird stuff.  Have you ever seen him with a kid, or was it implied pedophile?  No, it was implied pedophile.  Yeah.  You still doing the stand-up there, Adam?  Yep.  Yep.  Well, I'm going to be at, actually, the Pechanga Casino.  Pechanga?  Pechanga.  Where's that?  In Temecula, California, right by San Diego.  Those are the worst words I've ever heard.  Pechanga and Temecula. 
[02:08:00]  How are you working there?  Yeah, and I'm working there.  How are we supposed to find this joint?  You know, it's on the West Coast.  All right, well, I think there's too many casinos that they're starting to call in Pechanga.  They're making up Indian words.  They're running out of Indian words.  The Tomahawk Casino.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be at Teepee's in Ohio.  Adam's a good comic, man.  He's a very light guy on stage.  Really bugs me.  The crowd loves him.  Yeah.  He's boisterous.  They do.  Oh, and the girls.  It's so...  Ugh.  Where the hell were we? 
[02:08:30]  Our governor's out in Levittown, and we're hanging out.  I go to see my pal, Adam, and he just kills, of course, and then there's the bar outside  of the main showroom, so I walk out.  I sit at the bar, grab a beer.  Adam gets done.  He comes out, and it's like that old Bugs Bunny cartoon where the chicken comes, and  he's the Frank Sinatra chicken, and all the other little chickens swoon over him.  Oh, look at that.  They all come walking up to Adam, and they're just, like, fawning over him.  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[02:09:00]  And I get some fat guy in a whack bag t-shirt.  Hey, you're Anthony.  Yes, I am.  A fat guy in a whack.  A far-going leg on.  He comes in, Mr. Opie and Anthony, with, how are you, James?  Yeah, sure.  Oh, they love Adam.  They sure do.  Why don't we start, end the show with a fun story?  Yeah, what is this?  What do you got?  Well, no, we're going to save the audition tape.  We, you know.  Oh. 
[02:09:30]  That could go, we could go.  I know.  I heard a piece of it, and I.  That was creepy.  We're running out of time, and I, we.  Not even a taste.  If we save it for tomorrow, we could do this justice, all right?  He's awful.  Some kid's audition tape that Sam brought to the table, or somebody did.  Actually, a listener, I believe, sent it in.  The first ten seconds I heard made Goosebumps stand up.  I was, like, so embarrassed for him.  Yeah, we're organized now, if you've got something for the show, on our website, there's, like,  a link there where you can send stuff in.  And this guy took advantage of that, and thank you for that, because he gave us Radio Gold 
[02:10:00]  for tomorrow.  Yes, it's a website called DoWhatWe'reTooLazyToDo.com.  See, I told you.  We've got radio execs in big offices now.  See, I told you.  It's not a joke.  It's not a joke.  They don't show crap.  We're not joking about this.  We're paying for garbage.  Let's go to country.  Oh, sorry.  Here we go.  Sorry.  This is no fictional comic book hero seen in handcuffs getting booked at the Melbourne 
[02:10:30]  Police Department.  Instead, it's Dr. Raymond Adamsick, dressed up as Captain America.  His name is Dr. Raymond Adamsick.  Adam Adamsick.  Aw.  He's a doctor.  Sorry to hear that, pal.  He's a doctor.  Doctor.  Yes.  It would be kind of like if he was a, imagine if he was an OBGYN and his name was Dr. Smelly.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  Dr. Stinky. 
[02:11:00]  Wait, it's Dr. Dumpster.  All right, Jesus.  Instead, it's Dr. Raymond Adamsick, dressed up as Captain America.  He was arrested Saturday night at the ONTAP Cafe and Lounge.  Now, he's being accused of grabbing a female patron's privates and verbally abusing her while he was out partying. 
[02:11:30]  It was just a group of doctors that were traveling throughout the city, going from bar to bar.  While the Marvel character is often seen as a symbol of American spirits, the female patron's boyfriend saw something very different.  According to police, he defended his girlfriend's honor and fought the alleged villain.  The alleged villain.  What an idiot.  What is she trying to make of this piece? 
[02:12:00]  I don't know.  A guy in a Captain America outfit grabbed this girl's privates and then verbally abused her?  It's like, how angry are you?  Yeah, that is angry.  Do one or the other.  Don't combine them.  That's just ugly.  I'm here for pecked America, you...  What do you say?  And how good a grip do you have where you can verbally abuse her while still grabbing?  It's Captain America.  It's got a hell of a grip.  And the boyfriend defended.  The boyfriend was dressed as Red Skull.  And he had to pull Captain America's arm off. 
[02:12:30]  He's like, hey, cut the neck.  Hey, hey.  Oh, here's my Captain America f*** grab.  Your f*** is no match for my f*** grab.  Though when it came time to identify the attacker in a lineup, police had their hands full.  Batman.  Unfortunately, because there was a costume party going on inside the bar, there were several  men dressed as Captain America.  Police say the victim was able to positively ID Dr. Adam Sick. 
[02:13:00]  By smelling his hand.  No, they didn't actually...  She didn't recognize it.  They made a bunch of guys in Captain America outfits sit there with their hands down,  and whichever one the cat ran up to.  See, steal Adam's joke.  Make it gross.  He was able to positively ID Dr. Adam Sick.  Then he was hauled off to booking.  But the story doesn't end there.  According to authorities, Captain America had something to hide. 
[02:13:30]  While in the restroom, he attempted to flush a bag of marijuana, as well as a joint, down the toilet.  Police say they were able to recover the joint from the toilet, but the bag got flushed.  Now the doctor faces a long list of charges, and those include battery and drug charges.  The funny thing is, how do they not be able to identify him?  Well, there's five guys in a Captain America outfit.  Only one has a bloody lip and black eye.  What did the boyfriend do, swat his shoulder with a purse? 
[02:14:00]  How did he have no visible marks on him?  Captain America charged with crotch grabbing and being a silly goose.  How do you not love that guy?  He's great.  All right, we got to get out of here.  Another Rock Scream Tuesday in the books.  A superhero can't flush dope down the toilet.  Yeah.  What kind of powers does he have?  What kind of flush do you do where the bag goes and the joint pops back up?  Yeah, he must have been pissed when that thing came up.  It's like, oh, damn, I almost had it.  Gives a new meaning to stink weed. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, it's in the toilet.  All right, Adam, what do we got?  We got Rescue Me Tomorrow Night on FX.  Very cool.  Very psyched that you're part of the fourth season in a big way.  And then you got that weird gig at some strange place that we can't pronounce.  But you idiot.  That's all right.  No one out there is hearing it anyway.  Oh, yeah, it don't matter.  Save your voice.  All right, Adam, thank you so much.  Good to see you guys again.  Don't be a stranger, huh?  No, I'll be back.  No.  Adam comes over for my poker games. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, I just, that's what I want to do.  Give you my money.  Donate money.  I don't win either.  You win.  Nah, it's Dan or Danny.  Or Brother Joe.  Yeah.  All right, pal.  Hey, good to see you.  Don't forget to get your tickets for Jones Beach.  Four days out.  We're very excited.  Eight, nine, twenty comedians.  I don't know.  Virus tour.  One word on MySpace for all the info.  And by the way, Red Rum had a great idea.  Something to do with a shower on stage.  Yes.  Very good, Red Rum.  We're going to investigate that thoroughly.  Let's look into that. 
[02:15:30]  And for anyone that's still listening, we'll give away a pair of tickets to the virus thing  right now at Jones Beach this Saturday.  Yes, at Jones Beach, 877-212-5762.
