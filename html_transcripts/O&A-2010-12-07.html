<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Opie recounting a near-bathroom emergency before the broadcast.  The hosts then immediately launched into a scathing commentary on the New York Jets' humiliating 45-3 loss to the New England Patriots.  Their discussion was rife with expletives and jokes at the Jets’ and Mark Sanchez's expense, comparing the game to the Harlem Globetrotters versus the Washington Generals.  They dissected the game's lopsided score, the poor weather conditions, and speculated on Rex Ryan’s questionable strategy, referencing a similar 1986 Jets defeat.  They also reacted to harsh listener comments from Twitter.

The conversation abruptly shifted to the arrest of Julian Assange, sparking a heated debate about the ethical implications of WikiLeaks and the release of classified information.  The hosts voiced differing opinions on Assange's actions, discussing the potential dangers to troops, diplomatic relations, and the broader impact on foreign policy, business, and the stock market.  They mentioned a large encrypted file Assange supposedly possessed, and the discussion included strong language and varying perspectives on the morality of his actions.

Interspersed throughout the show was promotion for a Paul McCartney concert ticket contest.  The contest involved a complex photo scavenger hunt at Beatles-related locations (Citi Field, the Ed Sullivan Theater, and Strawberry Fields), requiring participants to tweet their photos. The hosts humorously debated the contest rules and shared a funny anecdote about a (presumably fictional) call from Paul McCartney himself.  They also briefly touched upon the significant growth of SiriusXM subscribers since their early days and made a joke about Donald Trump's hair.

A substantial portion of the show focused on the WikiLeaks controversy, with callers weighing in on the potential damage caused by the leaks and Assange and Bradley Manning's motivations.  Callers discussed the government's response, the media's role in disseminating leaked information, and the double standard regarding information release by the media versus private citizens. A caller ("Can't Say") even claimed inside knowledge of government information-sharing practices. Other callers highlighted dangers to informants in the Middle East and the irony of Scooter Libby's swift capture versus the prolonged search for Osama bin Laden. The discussion included tangents on a poorly sung National Anthem at a sporting event (with audio clips played and comparisons to Whitney Houston), one of the hosts' upcoming comedy show, the R. Kelly National Anthem performance at a boxing match, and the extension of Bush-era tax cuts.  The language throughout this segment remained consistently vulgar and offensive.

The show then veered into a discussion about the vastness of the universe, spurred by Joe Rogan's tweets, leading to philosophical musings on infinity and the existence of a creator, again laced with humorous and profane language. This transitioned into speculation about the impending ends of Larry King and Oprah's shows, Howard Stern's contract, and – once again – the Paul McCartney ticket contest.  This version of the contest involved guessing the weight of a staff member, E-Rock, in his underwear and socks, leading to humorous debate about the rules and the necessity of closing the curtains to avoid nudity.

Next, the show tackled the E! reality show *Bridalplasty*, detailing its premise, the procedures offered, and the contestants' reactions.  The hosts and callers questioned the show's legality and discussed the contestants' personalities and desired procedures. A caller provided further detail on the show's challenges, and the segment concluded with more banter and discussion of the show's legality.  A call seemingly from Michu Kaku was revealed to be a prank.

The final segment began with a discussion of another bizarre reality show involving Botox and breast implants, highlighting its shocking premise and the absurdity of its creative meetings.  This segued into a clip of Al Pacino's uncomfortable appearance on Larry King Live.  A caller, Roland, sought medical advice from Dr. Steve, resulting in a diagnosis of possible sleep apnea.  The conversation then veered towards Dr. Steve's unusual "injection parties" and his profession as a hospice doctor, sparking further off-color jokes and speculation about his personal life.  The segment concluded with promotion for Opie and Anthony's upcoming live show, utilizing the recurring comedic device of adding "McGillicuddy" to various scenarios for humorous effect, frequently involving morbid and offensive themes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio  Satellite radio  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks  Oh, here they go again  Fun, dopey radio show  Not just any radio show  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream  The show is a lot funnier on any W  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us  It's just astounding to me  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn 
[00:00:30]  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later  There you go, all right  We just lost our demo, man  What's wrong with you?  This is the last straw for the rocking radio duo  The Opie and Anthony show  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  And we're off  Bye  Hi everybody  You can blame me for the late start  I was ready to go 
[00:01:00]  And then all of a sudden I felt my colon filling up  What did you say, Danny?  Like a water balloon?  Yeah  And I ran out of here as Ecstasy of Gold was playing  And man  Man  Felt a torpedo in this torpedo tube  Torpedo tube number one loaded  I was in a panic  I'm like, just throw anything on  Please, give me a couple minutes  You know, last week at the garden  Before Ozzy came on, Halford was on  And I went to fart  Did he stick his dick in and stop it? 
[00:01:30]  Right, that was record time for the first homo joke  But dude  I don't know what  It's like, you ever feel like  You're about to cut a gasser  And you realize that you're going to shit your pants  And all of a sudden you realize it's going to be liquid  And you're going to shit  And you have to emergency slam it with one of those  Yeah, but have you ever had that same situation  And you're not sure which way it's going to go  And you decide to go for it  I'm going to, it's like a game show  I'm going to go for it 
[00:02:00]  I think this is going to be a fart  But it could very well be that I'm going to shit my pants here  You know what, I've got to go for this  Now, are you going to hold it in?  I've got to go for it  Or are you going to try to fart?  I'm going to try to fart  He's going to try  He's going to try  Oh my god  Oh, oh  Yeah, because you feel the pressure  You're like, you know what  I'm in a situation right now  That I think I've got to go for this  Sometimes doesn't it feel like the air itself  Has to go around something?  Yes  You're like, it's either going to go around or push it 
[00:02:30]  Well, that's where the horrendous farts come from  Well, yeah  The air is just moving around a doody  Picking up all of its goodness  And that's why they're just horrendously bad  No, I did not find a beach, Kevin from Connecticut  Fucking Kevin from Connecticut  And all you fucking Pats fans  Fucking congratulations  Wow  And your fucking team up there in fucking Foxborough  Wow, what a  Chuts didn't even show up  What a close one  45-3  I gave up 
[00:03:00]  I congratulated everybody on Twitter  Around middle of the third quarter  It was obviously over  I did during the coin toss  Hey, might as well  It just looked over from the first play  It was just  It just looked over  Yeah  It was like, oh no  Brady's just back there  He's got a lounge chair  He could just sit back  The ball snapped  He's fucking doing his taxes  Whatever he wants to do  Obviously not a fan of Brady 
[00:03:30]  But he's an unbelievable quarterback  And what makes him unbelievable  Is the fact that  It was very cold  And very windy up there  And it didn't bother him at all  He knows how to play in that shit  Yeah  He was making passes left and right  And they acknowledged how bad the wind was  You know  Yeah  I don't think that had anything to do with it  I think like you said  The Jets finally got caught  A lot of people think  I'm not willing to officially say this  But a lot of people think  The Jets aren't as good as their record  They're a fraud  And they finally got caught 
[00:04:00]  They're a fraud  That's just what some people out there are saying  They were squeaking by Spicoli  But I bleed green  So I will not say that, sir  Bleed Jack green  I will not say that, sir  Bleed Jack green  What was the final score?  45-3  45-3  45-3  Yeah, it was 24-3 when I left  It was a complete spanking  And even the field goal they made  Was starting to curve to the left  I'm like, oh my god  Really bad  At least fucking  The dunk from Boston  How about that 13-yard punt?  Yeah  And then our punter 
[00:04:30]  Almost whiffed  Really bad  He almost whiffed  The punt was 13 yards  And I think that was because  It rolled forward slightly  And the abuse on Twitter was brutal  But Spectro and Michigan  I'm not sure if he said it on Twitter  But he says it here  Pats equals the Harlem Globetrotters  Jets equal the Washington Generals  Yeah, that's what it looked like  Did you see that pass Sanchez threw  Like right to one of the Patriots?  Yeah  Just like, I mean, directly to him 
[00:05:00]  Where it didn't even come close to a receiver  It was just here  You take this  Yeah  I don't want it anymore  No, no  I need my hands in a warmer  Unbelievable  In a hand warmer  Yeah, yeah  I just need to put my hands in my little hand warmer  I don't know if he could play in the cold weather this Sanchez  Oof  Being from Southern California  Yeah, well  A little suspicious of his cold water  Cold water  Cold weather play  It was grim  I think they got caught 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, I think you're right  For the frauds they are  Squeaking by  No, I'm not saying that  Squeaking  I am  Fraud  I'm not saying that  Was that a first place game?  What do you mean?  Like to determine who was going to remain in first alone?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Both 9-2  I would love to hear Joe Benningo today  You know Benningo  Sure  Oh  He must be really unhappy  Jets are now 9-3  Pats are fucking 10-2  But let's remember  We both have won  One game each  Well  In the season series 
[00:06:00]  I don't think  The game the Jets won  Was quite the blowout  I know  It's all about the 45-3  I can't spin this at all  First Patriots drive  Right up to the end  It was complete  Domination  Domination  I don't even know what else to say about the fucking game  I know  There's not even anything to say about it  It was supposed to be the game of the year  Yeah  They hyped it up  And Belichick is like  No, it's another game for me  You hype it up all you fucking want  Yeah  And talk about it being a rivalry  It's just a game for me  Yeah 
[00:06:30]  That guy is miserable  He doesn't want to put the Jets on the same level as the Pats  No  So he wouldn't make  He wouldn't build up on the hype or anything  He's like  Yeah, yeah  They'll come here  No  You know why he's just a jerk, Belichick?  Is he a jerk?  He doesn't even get excited when they win the Super Bowl  I understand how he's so stoic during the season  But how about you show a little excitement when you win the fucking Super Bowl?  Well, isn't that like  That's why he's a jerk  Did Landry ever show emotion?  No  He was always a sideline guy just with his dumb hat 
[00:07:00]  Landry had more personality than Belichick  Did he?  I think so  Landry  Did Landry ever speak?  Well, he had a TV  I made a Tony Hill for celebrating  And Landry was like one of the first guys to hate the celebration  Oh, really?  Yeah  The touchdown celebration?  Yes  What a fuddy-duddy  He really was  Old school  What a fud  Stick in the mud  I think he banned his players from doing it  Really?  Yeah  Wow  Well, you know, one of his good old boyfriends  But he didn't mind getting his dick sucked 
[00:07:30]  That's from Landry  What happened?  Why, was he getting blown?  Yeah, he's a man  He got blown  Oh, yeah  I don't know if there's any stories about it  He was a tough cookie  He sure was  He was old school  Coach goes, yeah, very tough cookie  So, uh, you don't think he would like Rex Ryan  And how he handles  No, he just handles his press conferences  And  And I'm married to a supermodel  Are you?  He said that?  That was hysterical  That was funny, come on  Oh, yeah, come on 
[00:08:00]  Enough of the jokes  He was having a little fun  He's keeping his team loose  He seems like the kind of guy that they pulled off a job site  And gave the coaching job to  Sure, sure  He's a blue-collar guy  Yeah, let me tell you  I think that's why people that are, you know, fans of the Jets love the guy  Yeah  You got a lot of blue-collar guys that like their football  They can relate to a Rex Ryan  It's not all just football, double-speak  And fucking, you know, bring the brother game face  And all that stuff  He makes a few jokes  I'm a big fan of anyone with personality in sports 
[00:08:30]  You got personality  There's not a lot of it going around  So, I like the Rex Ryan  I would never tell him to shut up  Yeah  Keep doing what you're doing  Wow  Well, maybe  Took a little beating last night  But  Yeah, it was  It's easy to sleep on that loss  People expected  45-3  People expected a closer game  I mean, Jesus Christ  Yeah, at least maybe at 41 points  Yeah  He had a real dose of humble pie  Oh, ho, ho, ho  Apparently the Jets suffered a similar defeat back in the 80s 
[00:09:00]  What are you fucking Googling?  Uh, no, I heard it on the news  Uh, and the same  It was the same score  45-3  Yeah  To the Pats  No, it was to  Somebody else  Was it to  Um, yeah, same score  1986  Good  Somebody will  Somebody will blurt a team out  Good  Dolphins  Was it Miami?  I knew they were playing Miami  But I didn't think it was Miami  45-3  Did they keep Brady in?  This was the worst  Yeah, Dolphins  The most lopsided loss 
[00:09:30]  Jets' worst defeat since a 45-3 loss to the Miami Dolphins in 86  And it had to be against the Pats  Ah, Jesus  Yeah  In a first place Monday night football game  Exactly  With the whole country watching  It really is humiliating  It wasn't like a 4 o'clock game on a Sunday when people are holiday shopping  It had to be Monday fucking night against the Pats  Because you know the whole country is thinking  Of course  Same old Jets  Of course  Is this another little fun fact?  Last time the Jets started out 9-2  They lost the last five games of the year 
[00:10:00]  Well, yeah  That's true  They might have had a problem  Really?  Oh, boy  Yeah, but this is  You know  I'll say this much  This is Rex Ryan's strategy  Just telling you  Yeah  Yeah, and now everyone's thinking  The Jets aren't as good as their record  Maybe they aren't  That's the brilliance of Rex Ryan  He goes  Guys, I want you to get your asses kicked on Monday night football  He told them to throw the game?  Yes  And everyone will just put down their guard  And now they just march to the Super Bowl  That's an interesting theory  They march to the Super Bowl 
[00:10:30]  Very interesting theory  It's not a theory  I know for a fact  Oh, it's a fact  And the guy's like  But, but, but  And he's like  No, I know  I know it's Monday night  In front of a national audience  Very important  Monday night  I know it's up in Foxborough  But trust me on this  This is going to work  Were they giving you a razzin on Twitter?  Oh, boy  Saying things like  Oh, boy  Hey, what?  Did you forget where the end zone is or something?  Oh, boy  Oh, hey, look out  That actually would have been a good one  Wow  There were some doozies 
[00:11:00]  And then there were just some  Yeah  Some guys  Yeah, there were a lot of duds  I just wanted to make  But I was like  Wonder why I was so quiet  I'm like  What can I do with this?  What do you say?  What can I do with this?  I just wanted to make a joke  So I said something  And people were just like  Well, the Jets aren't even from New York  They're playing Jersey  It's like  All right  I just wanted to make a goofy joke  About the Louisiana Purchase  Hard to fit in during a football show  True  Always  Hard to fit in Louisiana  Here's one that just came in 
[00:11:30]  M3  TAL Metallica  Jesus  It seems like the Jets would rather jerk their dick  Than play football  Huh?  Huh?  Good one  The Jets were using Don Meredith as their quarterback  That's River Red  Doc  That's actually pretty good  Dandy Don  Because a dandy Don would have done almost as good  If you think about it  Dead dandy Don  Yeah  Is the audience too young to know Don Meredith?  Oh, he's dead  He was a fucking legend  There's a few  With the Monday Night Football thing 
[00:12:00]  I got a few chuckles with the  Dandy Don did his final  Nesty plunge into a six foot hole  You know, not a lot of people realize  He was doing the Nesty plunge  Can we pull the audio of Frank Gifford?  Frank Gifford was his on-air partner for many years  And obviously they were very close  Good friends when they weren't broadcasting  And ESPN had to have the halftime interview  With Frank Gifford from his home  Oh, they did  And Gifford was obviously a fucking mess  He just lost his friend a mere few hours ago 
[00:12:30]  Was he trying to have anal sex with a hooker?  And they said, hey  That's all I remember him for, by the way  Yeah  His greatest moment  And then he finally just bailed on the interview  Like, have a good day or something like that  Really?  And he was in tears  It's like  Damn  It's like, why are you doing that to the guy?  Yeah  Do you really need his thoughts on him at that moment?  Tell us, what do you remember?  Some memories of Dandy Don Meredith  Could you please?  Studley Moore writes  Breaking news  Sanchez fired 
[00:13:00]  Just saw him outside Home Depot  See, because he's Mexican  And now he's got  Because  Pick him up and bring him to a job as a day laborer  Yeah, yeah  We'd call that  But they went on and on  I just got killed on Twitter  There was nothing I could do  Fuck it  Tweet  Tweet  Yeah, we could find the Frank Gifford interview from last night  Patrice was good, too  Yeah, what was he saying?  Yeah, Big Mama Prods  Oh, he was just some funny fucking shit about the game  Every, you know  Every play he was tweeting something ludicrous  Really? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, he's a funny motherfucker  He's a great one on Twitter  Yep  He's a superstar on Twitter  When there's an event that's a good  A sporting event or something going on  Right  Patrice, he's a good one to have  Yep, yep  Big Mama Prods, right?  I know about Jim Leonard, JD, in New York City  But, you know  One guy  It was a big guy  We lost Jim Leonard  You know, one of our safeties  So  You're kidding  And everyone knew that would be definitely a fucking problem going into this game  But  One man does not a teammate  I'm not gonna blame the fucking 45-3 defeat on 
[00:14:00]  On one guy  On the fact that Jim Leonard's hurt  Although, you know, that's a biggie  That's a biggie for us  Yeah  That's a big position to not have  Well  We'll get him next time  Yeah, we'll get him next time  We'll get him next time  I think it's part of Rex Ryan's strategy  He's unpredictable, yeah  You don't need to win all the games  No, you don't  And if you have a big, huge fucking loss on Monday Night Football 
[00:14:30]  In front of a national audience  It's such a nice for the playoff run  I think he's brilliant  Because other teams will take you lightly?  Yeah, then they're thinking  Is that how it works?  It's the Jets  Okay  Yeah  They let their guard down  Wouldn't it be better to beat the Pats  And then have the intimidation factor going into the next game?  Anthony, you know, you would think that  You would think  You would think that  But that's why it's so smart  And that's why I don't coach the Jets  Right  That's why  And he didn't want it close 
[00:15:00]  Because then the guys would get a bad night's sleep  You know, if you talk to athletes  They say they sleep much better when they get blown out  Than if they lost by like  Blowout, yeah  By three points, a point, whatever  Yeah  So he wanted them to make sure they got a good night's sleep for the playoff run  That's great  That's about to happen  It's brilliant  Good, good for him  It's a brilliant strategy  45-3 is a humiliating loss  That really is  It was just  That's getting taken out to the woodshed  Oh, is that what they call it?  Ooh  Yeah  So you have some fun at the end  A little beating with a switch on your bare tiny 
[00:15:30]  Yeah  Does anyone know if Brady stayed in the game?  Did they pull him?  Or did they just let him stay in there?  Who watched that line?  All the way to the end  Well, all the Pats fans did  No one was leaving that stadium  You would think they would leave  No, they were frozen in their seats  Yeah, they certainly were  Brr  We've been to that stadium with that wind  Holy shit  It must have been a fucking cold one last night  Yes, it was  What else are you going to do with that?  There's nothing else to say  I know  Fucking  Brady threw for four touchdowns 
[00:16:00]  Okay  Sanchez had three interceptions  Sanchez just did not look good  Did not look good  Terrible  A lot of dropped balls to him  But he played the whole game  He did play the whole game  That's  You would think that's kind of crazy  Gets a little injury late in the game  Why do you keep him in there?  I think they just wanted to humiliate the Jets  Yeah, but Belichick says it's just a game to him  See that?  Yeah, but  He's a twisted fuck too  After taking, you know  He knows it's not just a game  Some shit  He doesn't want to acknowledge that  But he wanted to make it hurt  Yeah  Yeah 
[00:16:30]  All right, we've got to give away these Paul McCartney tickets  Yes, we do  I think we finally have an idea, don't we?  Yes  Yes, we do  And if we're going to do this  We've got to get it going now  Get it going early  Because it's going to take some work  When is the big concert?  Next Monday?  Next Monday at the Apollo  At the Apollo Theater  It's an exclusive show for the Sirius XM listeners only, I guess  Yeah  And maybe some VIPs thrown in there  Some VIPs  But you can't buy these tickets  No  I think it's celebrating 20 million subscribers 
[00:17:00]  Yeah  Wow  When we started on satellite, what was it?  Eight  Two point something, I think  Just eight  Sirius had like 600,000  Am I correct about that?  Oh my god, they didn't even have a million  That's right  And we had like two million or something?  Yeah, we were  XM was ahead for a while  XM was ahead all the way to the end  And technology too  Yeah  That was a horse race where the XM horse died in the fucking final stretch  Well, because the head had Down syndrome  But Sirius had good content 
[00:17:30]  I guess financially their structure was decent  XM had better content  I mean, but I'm saying  Until the Howard move, XM had way better content  Yeah  I will always defend that  And honestly, way more creative fucking people  Yes  But they decided to do what they did  And that's fine  It's a merged company  And we're all happy now  One big happy family  But XM did a fucking great job until that merger  They did  An amazing job  And some of those people should have been able to continue on after the merger  But they saw it another way 
[00:18:00]  Not really  No, no, I mean with other jobs  Oh yeah  They only took a couple people in the big positions  And then they were sort of pushed out, to be honest with you  They certainly went the right way with the CEO though  That was certainly a smart fucking head to lop off and kick  Completely agree on that  Completely agree  The whole, the titular head of XM was just an abomination  Really enragingly bad  Horrid  Yeah  Honestly, I think if XM had a CEO that really understood the radio game 
[00:18:30]  There would have never been a need to merge  I know  Because they had such a big lead that they just fucking couldn't figure out how to keep  Pain in the ass  Whatever  But we have the Paul McCartney tickets for next Monday at the Apollo  20 million listeners, subscribers  That's what this is for  And Paul McCartney put on a big show at the Apollo Theater  And we got tickets  He wants to be open for them  Oh yeah?  Yeah  That'd be nice  He said, but make sure it's really dirty 
[00:19:00]  I love your Paul McCartney impression  Yeah, people say that like  If you're not looking, you think it's him  He does these impersonations  I swear, you would think it was the real people  You would  Was there more to your conversation?  No, that was it  That was pretty much it  He called me up  I got a message  I delayed it though  That's too bad  It's like  I understand you've done some really good comedy  I would love to have you come on  Do some of the Apollo  Arnold Schwarzenegger you're opening for? 
[00:19:30]  No  Arnold?  That's an English Arnold Schwarzenegger  Perhaps  Why do you got to open for me?  Just keep it really dirty  I'm a beetle, you idiot  My name is John Lennon  Ringo  He asked me just to keep it dirty  Can we play Total Recalling?  Recalling!  So we can only mention this  Can we play that into break?  Thank you  Can we only mention this once?  I don't know  I think we can only mention it 
[00:20:00]  Right?  Yeah, this is your mission  Should you decide to accept it  Kind of a thing  What happened yesterday after the show  We were trying to figure out  How to give away the tickets  Instead of just doing a quick contest  Knocking around some ideas  By the way, Mafia Life Chris  Hit me up with an idea on Twitter  And the email  It's a great idea  But we don't have enough time  To do your idea  We have to get these tickets done today  I said  My suggestion  He gets mad if I don't acknowledge them  So there's your acknowledgement  So there you go  My suggestion was rejected  I said, how about we have the listeners take bricks 
[00:20:30]  And throw them through as many fancy store windows as possible  Yeah  And then at the end of the day  We give the best brick thrower Beatles tickets  But they're like, that's too vague  Yeah, yeah  Nor is it funny to say  Well, one of the ideas  And it's the reason I kind of have given up on contesting  Like how we used to do it  Because it's really tough in this environment  Yeah, there's wording  I'll keep it PC today  You got lawyers in an environment that's very different 
[00:21:00]  Than when we just said  You know what?  Today we're going to do  What's the craziest thing you'll do for Britney Spears tickets?  We didn't have to go through lawyers or nothing  As long as we could get, you know, the FCC off our fucking backs  We were fine  Yes  And it's gotten to the point where we finally came up with an idea  One of the guys did  I think it was Derek  Best Beatles memorabilia  Yes  All right, that's kind of cool  And we'll get to see some cool stuff, you know  People bring it in  And it's all right  It's not going to  It's not going to  It's not going to set the world on fire or anything 
[00:21:30]  Oh  And then all of a sudden they come back to us and said  Well, that idea can't be done because  It's too vague  It's too subjective  Subjective  Because it implies  But I wrote a big email about this  Yeah  It implies to me that there is a best piece of Beatles memorabilia  Right  And people could argue  This isn't the contest  No, this is not  This is what we suggested  People could argue whatever method you use to judge the best piece of Beatles  But so I said, how about we say you bring in Beatles memorabilia 
[00:22:00]  And whichever one the guys like the best  Yeah, that's how it used to be  And all, yeah, judges' word is final  You know, they have disclaimers like that  In radio, the rules used to be  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton are the judges  And whatever they decide is final  And that used to be good enough  But for some reason that has changed now  And now if you do a contest where it's subjective  You're opening yourself up for lawsuits or something  I don't even know  And that's people being greedy scumbags and suing  I guarantee you there have been lawsuits already 
[00:22:30]  Not with Sirius, but with other companies  Then I wanted a water drinking contest  Yeah  But that went down the shitter  Then write your rules better  Because now you're thinking way, way too fucking far  And I said put the tickets in a church pew  Right  And then pick it up with your penis  That didn't go over either  No, I won't give the real contest  Yes  It's already  But that subjective thing was like  I'm not wasting my energy on stuff that I know will not ever pass with these guys  Oh wow, he's running fast  But Anthony's idea is pretty good 
[00:23:00]  This is it  Now you've got to think back  To the heyday of the Beatles  Ah yes  Remember the British invasion  The four mop tops coming over from Liverpool  The lovely Liverpoolians  Coming over and just sweeping the nation  Remember  Remember as I just hope to maybe get a Beatles song playing  While I'm babbling like an idiot here  But somebody is just kind of standing there 
[00:23:30]  I saw him standing  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, maybe  And E-Rock was standing there  What do you think your job is in there?  To just stand there?  What's the matter?  I don't know  I'm looking for Beatles songs  And somebody's calling on the  Oh yeah, blame it on them  I think you can hit a button  And probably get a Beatles song  He's spelling it wrong  B-E-E 
[00:24:00]  Come on, Eric  Why would we pump the discussion up?  That's dumb  Yes  You know, I want to build a little excitement here  About what this is about  We're having a contest  Giving away Beatles tickets  You're going to have to do something  It's based on Beatles history  Here in the United States  How about this?  I still wait  Can we give out?  I'll do it  Maybe we can do it for incompetence  E-Rock  Have fun at the concert  Thank you, Danny  Danny's got it  Thanks, Danny 
[00:24:30]  What were you saying?  Wow  Oh, and I like the song too  Of course  Yeah, she was  What I mean  And if you remember  The Beatles came over  And swept the nation  With their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show  And the big concert at Shea Stadium  Remember that?  Yep  And we also remember the tragedy  Yes, John Lennon  And the death of John Lennon 
[00:25:00]  Which they made a little park  Called Strawberry Field  Up  Uptown there  And  I have no fucking clue  I've never been there  It's my neighborhood  Is it?  Yeah  72nd Street  Well, here's the deal  And Central Park West  Is the entrance  You're going to have to grab yourself  Just trying to help the people out a little bit  I hear you  You're going to have to grab yourself  A newspaper  Probably the post  Or the daily news 
[00:25:30]  Something that would prove  That it is today  Not that you would just have  A stock picture of these things  Just in case  Whoa, whoa, whoa  Don't say  I already know  Don't say any  Or something like that  Just say today's paper  We don't care which paper  Today's paper  Because they're going to go  You're going to come running down here in a panic  Like, oh my god  You did not just say that  That was such a suggestion  No, you're  It's not about you  Trust me  Yeah  One of today's papers  One of today's New York papers  Whatever  Whatever paper  Just a paper 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, one  A newspaper from today  Okay  Some of the newsstands  Has papers from  Other parts of the country  And maybe the New York papers  Weren't delivered yet  Hill Valley  The Hill Valley paper  The Hill Valley paper  With a big story about the clock  That was a joke  Because now the lawyer's going to run down  Like, oh my god  Can't be a fake paper  Save the clock, Tyler  No  Oh, god  Yeah, you need a newspaper  Hostage style  To prove that it is today  And we want you to take a picture 
[00:26:30]  At  Citi Field  Which is the  Mets  Home stadium  The old Shea Stadium  Which used to be Shea Stadium  Well, Shea Stadium used to be next door  Yeah  But just  In front of Citi Field  In front of Citi Field  You've got to see Citi Field  Yes  In the background  Or something  And by the way  Can I throw in this amendment  Yes  By saying you have to see it in the background  It can't be from 10 miles away  You actually have to be  No, be there  There  No  Yes  And then you also need a picture 
[00:27:00]  From the Ed Sullivan Theater  You might know this as David Letterman's studio  Where he tapes the Late Show  It'll say David Letterman right on the marquee  Don't worry about it  Or Late Show, I believe  Late Show  Late Show on the marquee  And then  We want a picture from  Strawberry Fields  Of course  You can do this in whatever order you want  Don't say just Strawberry Fields  Yeah  Yeah 
[00:27:30]  You want what?  The Imagine thing  The Imagine  Because Strawberry Fields is a lot bigger than the Imagine thing  But someone could just go in the park and go  No  And then the lawyers go  Well, no, it's not  We Google Earth it  And that's not fucking Strawberry Fields  So now we've got another problem  That's the Imagine thing  A plaque  He's on the ground  Oh, the big famous Imagine tile thing  Oh, the Imagine tile  It's like a little fucking thing  That's a circular  It's on the ground  Alright  You've got to have that in your picture  You've seen the Imagine thing  It says Imagine  When you have all three of those pictures  You tweet them 
[00:28:00]  Tweet them  To  Let's go with OA Photos  OA Photos  Because we're trying to promote that Twitter account  It's a great Twitter account  Because it's all the old school photos  From all the years we've been doing radio  So OA Photos  Tweet that  And very easy to remember  All three  All three  To OA Photos  Twitter, of course  And the first person to do that  Will get the tickets 
[00:28:30]  That's how it works  For Paul McCartney  The Apollo  This takes you around a few places  How many tickets do they get?  83  That's not  That is not true  Do we have two pairs to give away?  I believe  That'll be the first pair  That's the first pair  That's the first pair  And we'll leave it at that for now  Leave it at that  We'll have another pair to give away  A little later on the show  That'll be a little easier  Yes  Maybe to include the whole country or something  Yeah, yeah  But this'll be  This'll be the one 
[00:29:00]  That kind of gets people  Running around New York  This is a little difficult  You've got to go to some  Historic Beatles  Locations  So once again  And real fast  For the Paul McCartney tickets  A pair of tickets  At the Apollo Theater  This coming Monday  You have to take a picture of yourself  With a  Today's newspaper  Hostage style  Like that  That's how the hostage people do it  In front of Citi Field  In front of  The Ed Sullivan Theater  Which is also the late show  With David Letterman Theater  And the Imagine Tile 
[00:29:30]  Memory thing  Of John Lennon  At Strawberry Fields  Exactly  That's what you need  All three of those  You then tweet it  To OA Photos  And at Twitter  The  At  I hate the  Ampersand  Yeah, they know  Yeah, of course they do  Get on Twitter  And that's it  What's wrong with you  Figure it out  If you need any more info than that  I'll punch you in the head  And for the people that are like  We'll have another pair  That we give away to  Will they say that? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, pretty much  That's what I read  When I fucking read  Half this shit  Oh, God  We'll have another pair  That's a lot easier  For everybody  Yay  To have a chance  To win  That listens to our voices  Right  On a daily basis  Look at that, huh?  Very good  Beatles tickets  Go get going, man  Get on it  Get on it  And we can only mention this once?  No, we can mention it  But we have to mention every single thing  I just mentioned  The exact same words?  Are you sure about that?  We can mention it more than once  We just have to give out  All the information 
[00:30:30]  Oh, okay  And you must be an active  Sirius or XM subscriber  Since November 15th  Why since  Because that's when they announced the show  Because that's when they announced the show  I don't know  I don't know  Maybe because it's exclusive for the listeners  Is somebody right now  Just jamming on the brakes  Because they're in a friend's borrowed car  And going, fuck!  Well, it's like  What are these guys  You can't  A lot of people  A lot of places do this  You can't  It's to make people not like  You know, subscribe just to be able to 
[00:31:00]  Well, that would be a shame  For people to actually start subscribing  Right  Like to get some subscribers  Just based on  The  What?  They don't want people  Don't subscribe  I know  Like Pearl Jam does it  For their tickets  That is hysterically  Fucking ludicrous  What are these lawyers?  I gotta walk by their office  They gotta be the biggest fucking force  Don't want them subscribing now  And then going  They just sit around  They just sit around  Every day thinking how they could  Complicate the world  That's what lawyers do 
[00:31:30]  That is pretty funny  And I know there's a few of you out there  That are good, solid lawyers  Yeah, whatever  I mean, we deal with lawyers in our lives  But most of you are just the worst  Their role  Gotta be an active, serious, or XM subscriber  Since November 15th  Ugh  Jesus  And that's that  All right  So if that is you  Get a newspaper from today  Get to Citi Field  Take a picture  Get to David Letterman's  Late Night Theater  Which is the Ed Sullivan Theater  I gotta get the newspaper  From November 15th 
[00:32:00]  No, no, no  That is today's paper  Oh  Yeah, yeah  Today's paper  Early edition?  It doesn't matter  It doesn't matter  Can it be the late city final?  Well, I don't think  I think it'll be done  By that time  Sure  Yeah, and Strawberry Field  The plaque on Strawberry Field  Right, right  Imagine  I don't know if it's really a plaque  Whatever it is  What is it, a tile?  It's a bunch of tiles that say imagine  You've seen this thing  You can show them  You haven't seen it live  But you've seen  Give a shit about Strawberry Field  Can you show them the picture? 
[00:32:30]  And be honest  You've never seen this  You might have seen a photo of it  And not realized what it was  You think I go uptown?  No, but  It's only 70 seconds  That  Never saw it  You've never seen a picture of that?  Never saw that in my life  You who knows a little bit about everything  You've never seen that?  It's a mosaic  It's a mosaic  I would have called it a mosaic  How do you know that?  The Imagine Mosaic  I know it's a mosaic too  And I'm not the smartest one in the room  Take a picture of the mosaic  Yeah  You with the mosaic  Yeah  Thank you 
[00:33:00]  I didn't know that  Wow  Watch out for the homeless people up there  They bite  Yeah  Do they?  Oh, yeah  Where is the strawberry field?  I said it already  Yes, he did  Gregorio said it  I wasn't listening  72nd and Central Park West is the entrance  Oh, that's not bad  Yeah  That's not a bad area  No, the homeless like to hang out on the benches there  Oh, okay  It's a nice place  And watch out for the guy that has to make peace signs every fucking day  With flowers?  Yeah, he's known for doing the peace sign every day  And then he gives a little speech every fucking day 
[00:33:30]  What do you mean the peace sign?  That peace sign  Yeah, he's making like a peace sign  Usually makes it in a bunch of flowers  Yeah  He picks different flowers depending  But then every once in a while he'll make it in apples  You know what I call that?  What?  The footprint of the American chicken  Huh?  That's what I call it  The footprint of the American chicken  That's what they called it back in the Nam days  Are they?  Construction workers  Yeah  Peace, man  Footprint of the American chicken  America love it or leave it  Could you look up the peace guy? 
[00:34:00]  He does his every fucking day  Is this his whole identity now?  It's his whole thing  Oh, and he made it about him  He made the place about him  And he has to give a speech every day  Who listens to it?  All the fucking rubes that come to New York  The rubes  They crowd around the guy for the big speech  Thinking they're going to hear something real  Instead he has to brag about  All the different peace signs he's made over the years  One time he made it in bagels  Because it's New York  Oh, gives a fuck  Jesus  Why don't you make it in clits  Like it's the Sudan?  One time he got really crazy 
[00:34:30]  The cops went around  So he fucking did it in pot leaves  In weed?  Did a little weed  He's a rebel  He's crazy  But that's what he's known for up there  And he just sits there all fucking day  Yeah  This guy can go jump in the lake, Gregorio  Oh, easy  I hear ya  Come on now  I hear ya  They call him the mayor of Strawberry Fields?  Of course  He has to be associated with it  That's the guy  Make it about me, man  That's the guy  Peace  How many years has he been going there?  Probably three weeks  He's been there for a long fucking time 
[00:35:00]  I videotaped this guy before giving a speech  It's horrendous  Is it annoying?  It's so bad  It's not poignant?  No  No, not at all  Hacky?  Yes  Sixteen years  Sixteen years  He's been going there  Sixteen fucking years?  And he's pretty much there every day  Give it up  Pretty much  What does he do for a living?  Does he panhandle?  Yeah, he fucking puts the hat down  Oh, so he puts the hat down  He gives a little speech  Gets some money  And then all of a sudden the roofs just empty their wallets  Yeah, it says here  His last name is Dos Santos 
[00:35:30]  So it says Dos Santos' income comes from the tips he receives from tourists as a result of his work  And a three-minute monologue he delivers to tourists  So he just lives off of panhandling  That's great  Yeah, he talks about the Lennon Park in Cuba  And I don't know  He's just  Fantastic  Just making money off the back of  There's a Lennon Park in Cuba?  The dead John Lennon  Yeah, there's a Lennon statue and bench in Cuba  Yeah  That was big news when I did  Oh, communist  All right, let's take a break  So the contest is on  We sure can eat 
[00:36:00]  Contest on  Very good  I have to tinkle  The Colby and Anthony show on the virus  Virus  Sirius XM  Da-da-da-da-da  Hey, I forgot to mention one more thing about Monday Night Football  Please humor me  I just tweeted it  Did you see Donald Trump's hair?  Mm-mm  Dude, this thing will make you fucking howl  And I think they did it on purpose 
[00:36:30]  If you go to my Twitter, I just tweeted it  It's literally 12 seconds  They went to where Mr. Kraft was sitting  You know, and he had Donald Trump as his guest  With a gang  And in between plays or whatever  Is that it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And, uh  They got video of Donald Trump's hair trying to escape  Trying to escape?  The video's only like 12 seconds  I fucking zoomed in on my big  My big  My big TV  It's like an amusement ride  Whee! 
[00:37:00]  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  Whee!  It's flapping up like a fucking  Yeah  Like an entity unto itself  He has it probably so sprayed  But I guarantee you  There's something  Oh, holding it down  Is it right?  Comb over  Yeah  Is it a comb over?  Oh, God, yeah  But I think it's also weaved in somehow  No, I don't think  If it was a weave  He would just have it like  No, if it was a comb over  It would pop straight up in  Well, he's probably got it sprayed in pretty good  That's why I think he kind of has it  Has it matted on the other side 
[00:37:30]  I'm sick of his miserable face  Yeah, look at that  That, that, that, the pursed  Trying to be intimidating  What is it called?  Purse  Purse lips  Purse lips  But, uh  Ooh, I love to roast him  If you go to my Twitter, Opie Radio  It's like a divot on his head  I just, I just tweeted  I, I, I had to fucking go back  And, and, and film this fucking thing  Low class  Low class  Yeah, you're a classy guy  Fucking  But his fucking hair was trying to fly  Off his head  It looks like cotton candy  It does 
[00:38:00]  It does  Flapping around like that  Looks delicious  Yeah, whatever  It's just a quickie from last night  And I know Monday Night Football  Did that on purpose  I think they got  Oh yeah  I think they got this  10, 15 seconds  And they just saved it  And made believe  They were going to the booth live  Because the timing was too  Perfect on this  Yeah  They went there  And all of a sudden  His hair's flapping like that  Flapping in the breeze  Maybe they saw it a couple of times before  And were like  Just keep the camera on it, man  Yeah  Get it  Yeah, probably  Yeah, they knew what they were doing 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, because it was breezy  They were kind of chuckling  Going, there's your golf partner  But they didn't  They knew if they actually  Said something about it  Look at his wacky hair  Right  What's wrong there, Jimmy?  This fucking Julian Assange  The head of WikiLeaks  Yeah, they got him  Oh yeah  Breaking news  I know that there's been  These rape allegations  And they have been  Alleged before  Mm-hmm  We talked about it the other day  There is something disturbing  About the fact that his  Swiss bank accounts  Have been cut off  They're not allowing him to use  And I understand  Some of it's very sensitive 
[00:39:00]  Mm-hmm  And I've said before  As long as it's not  Endangering troops  But the stuff he's leaked  That I'm aware of  None of it's endangering  Tough shit  If it's fucking embarrassing  Tough shit  I'm just saying  It's making it rough  On diplomacy  Tough shit  You know what?  The fucking Saudis  Have been bankrolling  Fucking Al-Qaeda  And it should be out there  And if the North Koreans  Gave nukes to Iran  It should be out there  And if Hillary said shit  Fuck it  Let it be out there  I think the stuff that  The stuff is so bad  It could change everything 
[00:39:30]  We know  That's a bunch of people  Talking shit  It's like anybody else  And that's why  They're panicking  And trying to shut  The whole fucking thing down  The idea that  Regardless of what he did  Forget about what he did  The idea that  They can do this  To somebody  Of course they can  Is really  And right in front  Of everyone's face  This isn't a conspiracy  This is  This is something  That's being done  Of course  This isn't like  This wacky  Wow are they doing it  It's like no  This guy 
[00:40:00]  If he didn't  If he wasn't in  The head of the  WikiLeaks  And all this stuff  Didn't come out  They wouldn't have been  Fucking with him  With these charges  And freezing his bank accounts  And shit like that  They do this all the time  This one's just very public  Creepy  Everyone knows about it  What has he released  That is going to hurt  The troops  Or whatever  Maybe one of the listeners knows  I don't  Well in  In the  Trickle down theory  You know  Anytime you  You got diplomatic  Memos 
[00:40:30]  Getting exposed  Secret ones  It could endanger troops  Other people  Agents  It's gonna damage  Hearts and minds  I mean come on  They fucking hate us  No not so much that  Just  It's like  It's like if you go into  Negotiations  With a company  And  Some guy  Just puts out  What was being said  Between your agent  And the company  And that  And this  And that  And all that shit  Like gets out  And now 
[00:41:00]  The company knows  Your whole position  You know the company's  There's no bargaining  Leverage thing like that  You probably wouldn't be happy  With that  I agree  Of all sides  We're equal  But the thing is  We always  That's what everybody does  We're all fucking  Sneaks  Oh yeah  Everybody just fucking  Says one thing at the meeting  And then whispers  Like a bunch of little faggots  I like the fact that it's all  Go ahead  Fucking blast it out  Why shouldn't  If you want it changed  Go to  Imagine  Strawberry Fields  And put peace signs on the ground 
[00:41:30]  It ain't gonna fucking change  No but it's human nature  This fucking  Kvetching  What they  Do they care that Hillary Clinton  Or somebody else  Bad mouth  The king of  Fuck him  Diplomacy  In the world  Is based on this shit  I know  I mean  I don't know  Who didn't know that  What do they think  Everybody that goes there  And they sit in those chairs  That are too far  Awkwardly far apart  When they're filming  And there's a table  A dumb table in the middle  And the cameras are clicking  And they're just chatting  To each other  From five feet away 
[00:42:00]  And it looks odd  No  They're bad mouthing  Other people  They're making backroom deals  With other countries  They're speculating  What they should do  If something happens  And sometimes that speculation  Is taken out of context  That's where they are right now  We'll see  He also apparently has these other  A giant  A giant file  A terabyte file  Or something  He put out there already  But it's encoded  256 bit encryption  Yeah  Jesus  And he says 
[00:42:30]  At some point  If things happen to him  He's releasing the key  To the code  And everybody  That downloaded it  Will be able to  View it  So it's already out there  Smart guy  Yeah  He's not a dumb guy  He's going to end up dead  What if the government  Panics  And just shuts down  The internet  Because they don't want  That shit out there  It's hard to do  Shut down the internet  Since it's  You know  People  True  It's kind of hard to do  But it bothers me  That again  I don't know  What he's given away 
[00:43:00]  So far  If it's troop positions  Or things  But this diplomacy shit  Where the Pakistanis  We're like a bunch  Of schoolyard assholes  The whole planet  The Pakistanis  Aren't popular  They didn't say  Something about Hillary's dress  God fuck everybody  Tired of it  A whole planet of lawyers  The whole fucking planet  Is like that  Yeah it is  Oh no you said that  Smile and shake hands  And then motherfuck him  In the back room 
[00:43:30]  And then cry  That people found out  You motherfucked him  Who cares  That's what they're scared of  The motherfucking get out  Yeah their egos are damaged  Fuck them  That's what it is  Yeah it's  Yeah this guy  Went and you spoke to him  And you're all nice  And everybody's huggy kissy  And then you leave  And you tell some other  World leader  Or another diplomat  That that guy's an asshole  He is an asshole  And then it gets out  And it's like  Oh shit  But I was trying to  Make friends with him  I know he's an asshole  I was trying to  Make friends with him  And now he knows  That I think he's an asshole 
[00:44:00]  And makes things fucked up  I'm sick of all this  Sneaky peeting around  I'm tired of it  Everybody tiptoeing  Like a fucking pederast  On the world stage  Trying to protect  Their own egos  And their own images  It's annoying  Yeah  We need the Flintstones  Tiptoe sound effect  Because that's what's going on  That's exactly what it is dude  It's fucking horrible  Oh yeah  I think I had it  I want to hate this guy  But I can't  Everything I hear about this guy  I like what he's doing  And maybe that makes me an idiot  What's your name?  Me son 
[00:44:30]  Sorry  I like what he's doing  Transparency in government  Well here it is  Yeah let's get some  I don't know  That  I don't know about this one  I don't know  Because  And I'm not going to take  The old slippery slope thing  But where do you draw the line?  Where do you draw the line?  What this guy did  Now the next step  Is like  Information that's a little more sensitive  Where does it become  Treasonous?  I think that there's a certain  That's a good question 
[00:45:00]  But just because  Of course it is  Just because  But just because  There is a place  Where it becomes treasonous  And it's not the most  Easily definable place  It doesn't mean  That because he's at one point  Of the slope  That he's treasonous already  Like if he's giving away  Troop positions  Or  I don't know  That's blatant  It's a great question  Everyone would hate that  That's a good  I think everyone could rally behind  Hating him giving away  Our troop positions  That's a good question 
[00:45:30]  Yeah  I don't have the answer to that  But just because  I don't have the answer to it  Well  Doesn't mean that he's treasonous  Maybe we could get our friend  Alex Jones on today  I'm sure he knows all about this  We have Mike Baker  Today or tomorrow  Mike Baker's tomorrow  We'll talk to Mike Baker about it  Mike Baker  Your ex-CIA agent  I really would be interested  As to his take  Because he obviously  He'll have a good take on it  And the people of Pakistan  Have been strong allies  Of the United States  And we want to continue  That relationship  I can't stand that motherfucker  He's an idiot 
[00:46:00]  The guy from Pakistan  Jeez he sucks  What  Oh  Hold on  You are an ally  That will be our friend  That will be our friend  For  Two seconds  The guy from China  Is a homo  He's a fucking homo  Swear I  Hold it  Hold it  Saudi Arabia  Is one of our strongest  Most stable nations  To be allied with 
[00:46:30]  In the Middle East  Fuckers cut off girls' clits  They fucking cut off girls' clits  I got one  Oh  The British are coming  The British are coming  At South Island  I ran out of steam  But you know  And I'm sounding really archaic  Saying troop positions  By the way  Because everybody knows  Where the troops are now  With Google Maps  Yeah  So I don't know  What information is  But strategies and  Strategies or 
[00:47:00]  Strengths  Deployments  I don't know  What information  Secrets  But as far as  Egos being in check  And Hillary saying  Bad things  Fuck  All of them  And Saudi Arabia  I have been fucking  I'm so  Sick  Of the US  Being lapdogs  For that fucking country  Just a fucking  Terrorist ATM  I am sick of us  Being lapdogs for them  Let me go to Mike in Chicago  I've got a question  For Jim Norton  Mikey  Yeah  I guess Jimmy  You wouldn't mind  If somebody went through  Your emails  And your mailbox 
[00:47:30]  And advertised it  To everybody  No  You're right  I would not like that  But you have to  Understand something  I am not  I'm a citizen  I'm not on the world stage  And I'm not making decisions  That affect everybody's lives  And I'm not an elected official  There's a huge difference bro  You are right  I value my own privacy  I'm not saying  I want  Hillary Clinton's  Private life exposed  I'm not saying  That I want people's  Sexual liaisons exposed  I'm talking about  Decisions that are made  On the world stage 
[00:48:00]  That affect me  And affect all of us  Well it's the same  Just as if  You were going to  Start corporate espionage  That's the same thing  You're starting to  Advertise all kinds of stuff  And what about  Shouldn't be  Out there  Isn't there stuff  On the informants  And all that  We got some informants  Out there  That might be in trouble  Yeah  Things like that  Things like  Guantanamo  Deals that were being made  For other countries  To take 
[00:48:30]  Guantanamo prisoners  That you know  Wasn't supposed to get out  We'll do you this favor  But you got to take  This Indonesian  Muslim guy  Wait that's  That's a line I would draw  That's a good  Good point  Giving away identities  Of people  Who are agents  From any country  I mean really  That to me is where  It gets into  An area that I don't like  But as far as  Deals with Guantanamo  Good  How about this  Stop this fucking  Phony polite shit  That the US has been  Running around  Like we're fucking  Everybody's aunt  How about we fucking 
[00:49:00]  Start showing balls  Again as a country  Stop trying to be  Phony polite  Hey if you take  This one guy  Here's your option  He's a fucking criminal  Take him  Or we're gonna  Fucking put him  In the sand  And smash his face  You know what though  That was childish  Of me to say that  When we did have  Balls as a country  Which was  You could say  Under the Reagan  Administration  He got in a jam up  About secrets  That got out  With Central America  And Iran-Contra  Sure  And shit like that  That got out 
[00:49:30]  Now would you say  That that should  Have gotten out  Do you mean  With Ali North  Arms for hostages  Yes it should have  Those deals  You think that should  Have gone out  Yeah because  There's a reason  For covert operations  I was always  From the school of thought  With that whole situation  With Iran-Contra  That it's the government  Looking at  What needs to be done  In the best interest  Of the country  Yes  And doing it  In a covert fashion  Covert means  We allow them 
[00:50:00]  A latitude  Sure  To do things  That go beyond  Congress  Sure  And beyond  The people's  Knowledge  So if we  How about  And this is where  I'm calling  How about we  Become an honest  Society  As people  And understand  That and say it  I don't  I don't mind  That they did that  But I'm sick  Of the sneaking  Around  I'm tired  It's fucking annoying  Because then you get  The partisan politics  In play  Where if  He would have said  We want to go  And do this  And trade arms  And  Who do they give arms to? 
[00:50:30]  It would have been  The Contras  Yeah  Yeah  Arms went to the Contras  It was  Yeah  It was one of those deals  Where  It was shady  Yeah  It was shady  Sure  But  That was the deal  Especially  For the time  There are  There are things  Called covert operations  Things have to be  Kept quiet  It's the way  This country  Has operated  Since its inception  But there are  And I agree with that  There are things  That of course  Have to be secret  And the guy was saying 
[00:51:00]  Corporate espionage  I'm not  I'm not looking  For saying  That that's appropriate  I'm saying  The things  That I know  That he's released  I don't see  How they harm troops  And all I've heard  So far  From people  Is a bunch of  Politicians  Trying to make it  Look like  They said  Something  Differently  That's all  It has been  So far  Is a bunch  Of fucking  People  Who got caught  Shit talking  Like is that  What it's come down to  With Pakistan  And possible  Nukes  And fucking  Cash funding  To terrorists 
[00:51:30]  One of our closest  Quote unquote  Allies  We don't want  People knowing  That we bad mouth  Them when they're  Out of the room  It's fucking  Idiocy  Well it could be  Detrimental  Especially with  Something like  Pakistan  And their  Nuclear capability  Because they're  Supposed to be  An ally of ours  If they find out  If they find out  That we are  Keeping tabs  On their  Nuclear program  Making sure  They don't get  Completely out of  Control with it  Which is something  I think  You know  As far as  Being world police  It's too late  We are  Yeah  But  It's something 
[00:52:00]  That should be  Looked at  But in order  To keep the  Pakistanis  On our side  You can't  Tell them  That we're  Looking at  Their fucking  Nuclear capability  They're gonna  Get pissed off  So you gotta  Keep it quiet  You gotta  Smile  And use  You know  Some of that  Covert  Backroom shit  I understand that  But to the guy  That called up  And made it  Like oh your  Personal email  I'm very big  On people's  Private lives  And the government  Staying the fuck  Out of people's  Privacy 
[00:52:30]  Yeah  I've never  Advocated anything  That was breaching  Average citizens  Privacy like  Yeah  Go ahead  Look through  People's shit  Never  Yeah  Yeah  I understand that  I just think  This is a weird  Situation  I don't know  All the information  That was exposed  So I can't sit here  And go one by one  On what was okay  And what was worse  Than something else  But I really do think  This sets a precedent  To just leak shit out  That perhaps does  Fuck up our foreign policy 
[00:53:00]  Even business  Finances  World finances  The stock market  A lot of shit  Besides just military stuff  Can get really fucked up  If information gets out there  But look at  Look at the way  It's gone so far  The fucking  Ant United States  Runs around  Minding everybody's business  And fucking  The whole world  Hates our guts  Yeah  And we forgive  Foreign debt  And meanwhile  We have to vote  People out  So our fucking taxes  Don't get  It's sickening to me  The way the whole thing  Is run  I agree with you  Believe me 
[00:53:30]  I agree with that  Stop this phony  Polite shit  It drives me  I'm not saying  The US  Should be pansies  I'm tired  Of just trying  To be everybody's pal  Yeah  I'm sick of it  I'm sick of this  Fucking weak approach  It's like anything  That we know about  As far as politics go  We know about shit  And we go  Oh that's bullshit  That'll never change  This is the way  Business goes  With taxes  And other things  They're doing the same thing  With diplomacy 
[00:54:00]  We just didn't really  Quite know about it  In this detail  And now we do  And realize  Oh that's run  The same way  Every other part  Of the fucking  Government's run  No surprise  It's just bullshit  Yeah  And that's what  Again I don't know  If I don't want  Again secret identities  Coming out  Like but again  You want to blame  Assange for that  She didn't fucking  Scooter Libby  Who did that  To Valerie Plame  What was her name  Yeah yeah  The CIA  It was done by our people  It's like  So come on  Don't act like  We don't understand  Why it's done  Am I getting 
[00:54:30]  Killed in instant feedback  I'm sure people disagree  I just don't know  What information  Has come out  That would be damaging  To the US  Because they're all  Over the place  And the guy's going  Jimmy why don't you  Read all the leaked  Documents before you  Decide  I can only go by  What I've read  So  I'm saying that  We haven't read it all  And I don't think  We're going on  A specific basis here  We're kind of  Talking general  With the whole thing  Of information  Getting out there  And what would be  Detrimental  Let's go to Steve  In New York  Steve 
[00:55:00]  Hey Steve  Right  I think  The problem is  That there's a PFC  The private first class  I think it's Bradley Manning  Who leaked the documents  Yeah he looks like  Eastside Dave  Doesn't he  He sure does  He's the guy  He's the crush  The problem is  Weakleaks  Is just acting  As a conduit  For the information  That he leaked  Right  I think the government  Knows what's been leaked  And the problem is  They really can't stop  Weakleaks  Because they have  The information  So to charge him  With treason  You're going to charge 
[00:55:30]  This kid Bradley Manning  Who's pretty much screwed  You could charge  Why'd he do it  I have no idea  There are a bunch of  Argos on it  I don't know why he did it  But I think he's being held  By the authorities  Somewhere now  But he's the one  Who leaked I think  Something like  250,000 documents  So I think they know  What's out there  It goes beyond  I think the  You know  The stupid backroom  People talking  About each other  And all that bullshit  I think there's  More stuff  Giving up  You know  Various sources  And things like that  And that's what  They're afraid of  I have a feeling  They know what's out there 
[00:56:00]  Yeah  Trying to put a cap  The problem is  Genie's out of the bottle  So I don't know  How you put the cap back on  But again  Some things like that  I'm not being unreasonable  There are the sources  Certain things that  I don't know  Individually when I see  Certain things  I would go that  I would not want out there  I personally wouldn't  I just haven't seen  That stuff yet  I don't know  The problem is  I guess  They just  The problem is  I don't know  How do you stop it  And they just want to  Stop it as a whole  But I don't think they can  I mean  Weekly  The stuff that's  Most scintillating  For people to hear  The sources 
[00:56:30]  You know  Sources and things like that  Some of this stuff  Is fun to read  But it's  You know  I think somebody  From the UK  Got fired  Because he was exposed  For being a source  For the US government  Or something like that  But you guys  I mean  States need secrets  Some things are  Probably ridiculous  But at the end of the day  Trying to put the genie  Back in the bottle  Is tough to do  It's just  I don't want the  True answer  You're not going to get  This guy Julian Assange  On treason  Because he's not  A US citizen anyway  No no  You're not going to get  On treason  I wasn't saying  He would get 
[00:57:00]  Brought up on treason  But you know  You take an American citizen  Now maybe he leaks out  Information that is  A little more sensitive  I mean  What I was saying  Is where was the line  Where's the line drawn  But I don't know  I don't know  We'll see  Because this  This isn't going to be  A single case  Of just wiki leaks  There's going to be  Fucking  You know  Googie leaks  And all kinds of  Other fucking leaks  And that'll be  The next big thing  Absolutely  Thank you Steve  Let's go to  Cassius in Brooklyn 
[00:57:30]  Cassius  Cassius Clay everyone  Mohammed  What's up Cassius  Hello  Hello guys  Hi  Jimmy  Jimmy was saying  You know  He doesn't know  What's been harmed already  The very first time  He leaked stuff  A lot of informants  In the Middle East  He put up the names  Of all sorts of  Informants working  You know  Helping our government  Or trying to help  Our government  Well that's something  I certainly don't want  To put up  That  Okay let me just  Not to interrupt you  But that's something  I don't want  Yeah  That's  That'd buy it 
[00:58:00]  Yeah yeah  And the other  The other danger  With this guy  Is  Well Anthony said it earlier  That who the hell knows  What he's going to leak  In the future  You know  Where  Yeah  And once it's on the web  It's too late  Like once it  Graces the web at all  In the slightest bit  It's too late  To try to  Try to stop it  So  Yeah I do agree with you  That it's good  To get  To air this  These cables  Recently  Because it shows  What  These countries  In the Middle East  How they're lying  And you know 
[00:58:30]  Their coward  Cowardliness  I do  I do  Agree with that  But who the fuck  Knows what he's capable  Of doing  He said that he's  He's out to destroy  America  In interviews  He stated this  Plainly  You know  I didn't know that  And I don't want  The U.S.  And this is  Believe this is not  Me going  Fuck the sneaky  U.S.  At all  I just  I'm tired  Of the U.S.  And the phony  Politeness of this country  I keep saying that  And I'm not saying  We have to be barbarians  But I wish there was  Some semblance of honesty  The way we dealt  With other countries  Like look at the European Union 
[00:59:00]  All they did was  They bashed the U.S.  And look at the  Fucking financial trouble  They're in  It's like I'm sick  And tired of us  Always taking the hit  This is going to change  Policy though  Obviously  Big boy on the block  You know there's  More wiki leaks out there  So it's going to change  How the U.S.  Does business  That's pretty obvious  To everyone right  Let's  Another call coming in  From New York  Thank you Cassius  New York  I don't know your name  Brother  Is it me?  Yeah  Yes sir  Yeah  Wiki leaks  The latest thing he leaked  Was a whole bunch of  Energy infrastructure  And communication infrastructure 
[00:59:30]  All the points we think  Are the weakest points  And he put out  A whole list of them there  Just giving the terrorists  A road map  Of how to really  Inconvenience the rest of us  Alright well  Again  There's an example  Of something that I don't like  There's an example  Of something  That I don't think  Should be leaked  And the reason that we  Really shouldn't have  Leaks out there Jimmy  Is because  Remember before 9-11  We had all these problems  With information  Not getting from one group  Of the government  To another  Well now that they got  Some private  With all this information  And the idiots leaking it 
[01:00:00]  They're going to have to  Tighten up all that  Information sharing stuff  And it's going to go back  To us not knowing  What we should know  But dude  I don't agree with that  Because I'm telling you  When it was like that  The FBI and the CIA  Were not sharing information  When it was all secret  And I'm not saying  It's better that  All of it's out there  They weren't sharing it  They weren't sharing it  But now look what happens  When people start  Sharing information  It fucking  It makes a leak  Yeah  Alright  Thank you New York  Okay  I don't know what the solution is 
[01:00:30]  Yeah I don't either  I have no fucking idea  It's  It's  It's  Quite interesting  Mike Baker will have  A great take on it tomorrow  Yeah I'm kind of curious  As to what's been  Because again  Two people raised  Examples of things  That I certainly  Would not want leaked  Right  So there you go  Let's go  Let's go to Brian  In St. Louis  Oh yeah  I might be following  The St. Louis Blues  For the second half  Of the NHL season  They're making  They're making a good case  For me to be a  A fan of the Blues  For the second half  I would have  Got to pick that team soon 
[01:01:00]  Football  I'm all in with the Jets  Oh okay  All in  After last night  What you're  You're blowing it off  You said you were  The biggest Jets fan  I might bleed another color  Brian what's up buddy  It just amazes me  First of all  Yeah  Scooter Libby  Dick Cheney  They got about  100  100 to 200 people  Killed in Iran  With Bruce Jennings  Because he outed  That Valerie Plame thing  Yeah pretty much  In the paper  So I mean  That was a big  Big deal  What kills me  Is the fact that 
[01:01:30]  They chased this guy down  In what  A little over two weeks  And they cancelled  All this money  They basically  Followed the money trail  And yet  Here we are still  What 10 years in  And we can't get Osama  You know  Isn't that  Don't you think  That's kind of ironic  Not ironic  No  Nor do I think  It's conspiratorial  I mean I just think  That Julian Assange  Is an easier guy  To trace  Than a billionaire  Unfortunately  Who's protected  By religious zealots  Yeah Obama's not  Fucking running a website  Yeah and Assange  No but I mean  Videotapes  It's all about 
[01:02:00]  You know  It's all about  The Saudi  Obama  What's that sir  It's all about  Did he say  It happens all the time  Yes I think so too  I think it's about  The Saudi  And that's what  My major  Annoyance is  Is the United States'  Attitude about  Saudi Arabia  And how they're allies  And there's so much  And you know  They are hesitant  To shut down  These charities  Which they know  Are being funneled  To Al-Qaeda  There's a couple of them  Where they  Where they want to  Build schools 
[01:02:30]  And they have  Over inflated  Prices  So when the money  Comes in  They build the school  And then the rest  Goes to these  Terrorist groups  To bad  Naughty people  It's this understanding  They seem to have  Yes  I don't know  What's going on  We're talking about  WikiLeaks  And CNN has a whole story  On how they killed  Rudolph  What the fuck's  Going on in this world  Talk about WikiLeaks  You assholes  We'll talk about  How they killed Rudolph  Really  Why are we doing  Your job today  That whole story  Where was that  During the Thanksgiving  Day parade 
[01:03:00]  Rudolph got caught  On a traffic light  And a big fucking hole  Right in the front  Of his head  And then he's  Screaming  In front of the kids  It was in Gilly Plaza  Yeah  And the headline was  They killed Rudolph  That's what they're  Doing right now  Is we do this  WikiLeaks thing  Oh poor Rudolph  God loves  And they also are  Doing the  National Anthem  You want to take  A break before  The National Anthem  Guy  We'll do that  Oh I guess  National Anthem  And also Larry King  In rare form last night  He had Al Pacino on  Oh really 
[01:03:30]  What's he plugging  The Merchant of Venice  Probably right  He's doing that play  Across the street  From Colin Quinn  Good news for Colin Quinn  Long story short  Is extended until  February 5th  Yes congratulations  To Colin  That's a fucking  Huge extension  Because it's through  The holidays  Where everybody's  Going to be in New York  I'm telling you  This fucker has a hit  Big news  It's great  I'm not just saying  That because Colin's  My friend  It's truly funny  Yeah  And it's going to  End up on HBO  Eventually or somewhere  Something  He'll go on the road  With it  He could possibly  Do a run in Philly 
[01:04:00]  Or Boston  I'll do it all over  The country  Yeah so  Colin's on to something  Yes Jim  And there is something  That WikiLeaks  WikiLeaks leaked  That was supposed to  Be a big secret  Oh what was that  That's not good  And it's the final  A third and final show  Has been added  At the Borgata  There will be no more  After this  Because it's the only  Other time we have  You know the show  That's available  Which is Saturday night  11pm January 15th  The last show  Literally  Two hours in  We had no idea  We were going to do this 
[01:04:30]  Two hours in  There was 133 tickets left  And a lot of them  Were single  What yet  Wow  When we went on sale  Last week  Wow  Two hours in  Pete said you can  You can say the show  Was sold out  That's crazy  The tickets that were  Available were pretty  Much just singles  Damn WikiLeaks  Guy leaking that  Information  So this Friday  10am  The third and final show  Of the Antisocial Network  I am the host  Bill Burr  Dave Attell  Jim Brewer  This show is  Fucking fantastic  Oh absolutely  And the tickets are only  45, 55 and 65 dollars 
[01:05:00]  I think that's why  It sells so fast  Because they're reasonable  No one's getting fucked  Yeah 125 dollars  For a ticket  Or something like that  It's ludicrous  Yeah it's like  Four headliners  For 65 bucks  People can seem to  Stomach that  That's awesome  Yeah I'm very  Thrilled with the way  This is going  11 o'clock  Saturday the 15th  Goes on sale  This Friday morning  Friday  Alright  We'll do the dummy  Messing up the national anthem  Man  You never want to do that  In front of a sports crowd  No  Got the Larry King 
[01:05:30]  With the Al Pacino  Yeah  Now  Doing lines from Scarface  Really?  Wait till you hear it  Oh no  He does think  Larry does things  Interviewing that I'd be  Embarrassed to do at a party  And also  A guy says  Says cunt  And it could be  One of the biggest laughs  You can have  In a while  Or at least  He found it really funny  Where does he say it?  Obama was talking to Hillary  He was an NPR guy right?  We'll get the back story  After this  This is the O.P.N.A. 3 Show  There's too many men 
[01:06:00]  Too many people  Making too many problems  And there's not much love to go around  Can't you see this is a lot of confusion  Ha ha ha ha ha  This is the world we live in  And these are the hands we're given  Use them and let's start trying  To make it a place worth living in 
[01:06:30]  We got lots to do today  Can I point one thing out  Because I might have made it  No  Why isn't the media declared treasonous  When they print everything  Freedom of press  I'm not saying they should be in jail  I'm talking about the  Perception of them  Why is this guy so demonized and criminalized 
[01:07:00]  And yet the New York Times  Or a million other newspapers  Would print everything he wrote  Or revealed  That is freedom of press  Okay but how come  You're terrible to reveal a spy's name  And yet the media is fine  To print  Like  It's this really weird line we have  Yeah it really is  With who can say what  Well it's kind of rough  Because it's not perfect  You know  It's a great point though  Because you go back  To the famous Janet Jackson thing 
[01:07:30]  At the Super Bowl  And everyone was outraged  But they were allowed to show it  But because it happened  During the Super Bowl  Those guys are the ones  That were in trouble  Why not the rest of the media  That showed it a million fucking times  It's your same point  Yeah it's exactly the same point  Because they're doing the same thing  And I'm not saying they shouldn't be able to  But I'm only talking about  The perception  Of if information is leaked  That is really damaging  The media  Maybe not always 
[01:08:00]  But I would say 90% of the time  Will print it  Without caring about the consequences  Except to the most extreme cases  Yeah of course  Of course  They don't care if it gets people killed  They're not held accountable  If people are killed  By them giving away certain information  Or certain propaganda  They're never held accountable  Yeah  So it's just  Again I don't know if that means anything  They're under that umbrella  Of the First Amendment  So it's  People should be outraged  By the media  For keeping these stories going  You know when someone 
[01:08:30]  Gets in trouble  That's so brutal  But they'll replay  The brutal audio  Or the brutal video  Saying look how outrageous  And bad this is  Now that private  Was disgusting  To release a lot of this stuff  And you could say  That Assange was disgusting  To release a lot of this stuff  But I never went to WikiLeaks  I never heard of it  You know who told me  The media  Oh my god  You're so right  I never heard of this guy  I know more about WikiLeaks  From just reading it in newspapers  I never saw what he looked like  Right  Or other websites  You know who told me  Some of the things that were said  The New York Post 
[01:09:00]  Yeah  Not him  The Post and the Daily News  So why is that okay  They printed  What was said about  All this stuff  And their whole thing is  Well the cat's already on  There's always an excuse  Oh man  More people are finding out  What WikiLeaks is all about  By reading it in the newspapers  Instead of going to the website  That's a fact  And the media would have  Gone undercover  And gotten a lot of this stuff  If they had the means to do so  Right  And there are certain things  I'm sure they wouldn't print  But I think 90% of it  They would 
[01:09:30]  Hey we got Can't Say  From Can't Say  On the phone  Can't Say  From Can't Say  What's going on  How's it going guys  Hi what's your name  Where are you from  Jeff  I'm from here  And that's my name  Alright buddy  So Jimmy had a couple questions  About certain types of information  The answer I can't tell you  The reason why the press  Is allowed to release certain things  Is most of the time  They get clearance to release it  Even though  That's not on the books  The clearance to release it  Is out there  Oh okay I didn't know that  The only time 
[01:10:00]  It's ever been really stopped  If you guys remember  The Pentagon Papers  Is the only time  That's really been  They put the kibosh down  And stopped the New York Times  Yeah  Other than that  You wanted to know  Questions to  FBI and CIA  Backward compatible information  Is CIA  Sometimes  Information sharing  To the DOJ  Isn't allowed  Because the information  Isn't gathered  Legally so to speak  Yeah  So that's why  There was information blockages  That's why there's  Still information blockages 
[01:10:30]  Can I ask you a question sir though  Because you obviously  You know  You sound  At least you sound  Like you know  You're talking about  How much of it is  Because the CIA  Collects things illegally  And how much of it  Is really departmental ego  Where the CIA  Doesn't like sharing  Or the FBI  Doesn't like sharing  Because they feel  Like they've worked for it  And there's like  Those departmental rivalries  As well  Well you have politics  In your workplace as well  Right  Sure  Sure  So that's a lot  Some of it does come down  To the simple politics  Of the matter is  People want to look good  On paper 
[01:11:00]  Because that's how  They're decided  But that's kind of  What bugs me  Because like politics  In this dump  Is you know  Us trying to get  A stupid contest through  Or you want to get  A chick to put a  Fucking hoagie  In her vag  We're not making decisions  On no fly list  Or terrorism  Or things that affect  People's lives for real  Yeah this is true  But you have to remember  It's all the same  When it comes down to it  It's someone's job  It's someone's job  Yeah that's true  And that's pretty much  What it shakes out to  If it's gathered legally  Usually it's shared  If it's not  It just can't be  NSA and CIA 
[01:11:30]  Do have programs  Where they take information  That's not exact  That can't be shared  Because it can't be used  Right  So what's the point  In the information  Right  It can be acted on  But they can't  Well but I mean  Stuff like with  Didn't they not share  Identities  I'm trying not to go  Ah as much  Of 9-11  Suspected hijackers  Weren't there  Information that just  Wasn't shared  The agencies weren't  Sharing information  That could have been shared  Of course  That was more ego 
[01:12:00]  And politics  Internal politics  And that's the stuff  I'm talking about  That was apparently  Taken care of  Over the past few years  Yeah nothing's happened  Since 9-11  Knock knock wood  Something has worked  Since 9-11  Yeah yeah  I mean  I just wanted to  Answer a couple  Questions for you  But I gotta get going  Okay  Alright brother  Thank you  Thank you  Is there any more  Wouldn't that be funny  If he's like  I gotta get going  And you cut to him  He's hanging up  And jumping out  Of a black helicopter  With fucking parachute 
[01:12:30]  Into some jungle  Somewhere  Or  Or  Alright guys  I gotta go  Can I take your order  Yeah  One or the other  That's probably it  Actually  Fries are up  Asshole  Yeah you hear  An alarm  I gotta go  Fries are up  Oh  Ma  Ma  I gotta do this now  Ding fries are done  Or what  It's the holiday season  A little ding fries are done  Hey we got a guy  Fucking up the national anthem 
[01:13:00]  Why  We got some comedy  For you  Well it's a tough song  To sing  We all know that  Very tough  Very hard to sing  Even if you know the words  And a lot of us  Don't know the words  There's a part in there  Where we all kind of mumble  What part gets you  Nah I know it all  Yeah go ahead  I'll start low  Oh say can you see  By the dawn's early lights  O'er the ramparts we watched  Were so gallantly streaming 
[01:13:30]  Nice try shit dick  Who's brought stripes and bright  You fucked it up  Yeah I did  And the rockets  What about the rockets  You fucked it already  Wait what was the  What's the  I went into the  Third verse second  Oh say can you see  By the dawn's early light  What so proudly we hailed  You commie fag  Yes what so proudly we hailed  At the twilight's last gleaming  Who's brought stripes and bright stars  For the perilous fight  Or the ramparts 
[01:14:00]  Or the ramparts  It's O-E-R though  Parts of a ramp or something  We watched  They was gallantly streaming  Like a bunch of  Streams from rivers  I'd write it down on my hand  So we got audio of  This dummy messing up  At the Chiefs-Broncos game  This is a biggie today  My life is like  Screaming  Oh do the  That was killing

This thing is, uh, he cracked himself up  NPR  I think it was NPR  Is that him?  What's happening in the course of the next hour?  Well, first up after the news  We're going to be talking to Jeremy Hunt, the culture secretary, about  Broadband  It's eight o'clock on Monday 
[01:33:00]  The 6th of December  American officials have condemned WikiLeaks  After the website published a list of hundreds of facilities  Said to be vital for American security  Every community in Britain has been promised  That they'll have access to the fastest broadband networks  Within five years  Excuse me  And Egypt has called in international shark experts  To investigate a series of attacks  In the Red Sea  Pardon me  Coughing fit 
[01:33:30]  The news comes from Rory Morrison  A word before we go on  I'm afraid many of you will have noticed  That I landed in one of those awful verbal tangles  Just before eight o'clock  Courtesy, I should say, of Dr Spooner  Some of you, we know from emails  Thought it funny  Some, we also know from emails  Were fairly offended on Monday morning  And, uh, all I can say is  Occasionally in live broadcasting  These things happen  And, uh, I'm very sorry to, uh, anyone  Who thought it wasn't what they wanted to hear 
[01:34:00]  Over their breakfast  Neither did I, needless to say  And we have an email from Mike Page  A reader in psychology  Oh, well, that might help  The prominent speech error in today's programme  Was more the Prime Minister's fault than Jim's  He says  It's well known in psycholinguistic research  That two words that share a vowel  Are prone to a speech error  In which the initial consonants are exchanged  For this reason, making Jeremy Hunt  The Culture Secretary  Was reckless in the extreme  Jim can be reassured  As can viewers, listeners  That the underlying theory 
[01:34:30]  Has far more explanatory value  Than Freud's theory of parapraxis  Or Freudian slips  I'm most grateful, uh, Professor Page for that  If I may repeat  Sometimes things happen  In live broadcasting  That, um, you deeply regret  And, uh, anybody who  Was offended by what they heard  I'm very sorry  And, uh, I hope you all realise  That it was, uh, the most  Unintentional thing imaginable  There we are  We'll pass on quickly  That's it from us  Our editors were  Olly Stone, Lee and Jack Gill

[01:39:30]  It's an extension of what  Bush did  It's just not raising  The fucking taxes  Like Obama wanted to  So Obama doesn't get  Credit for this  No  For extending it  No he never would have  If the fucking  Republicans didn't  Take over the house  But he kind of did  And some of the  Democrats even  Realized oh fuck  I am so out of a job  If I don't go along  With the Republicans  On this  That they got some  Democrats to actually  Go along with this  Reid fucking left  And somebody said 
[01:40:00]  When Reid walked out  He looked like  Someone had shot  His dog  He was very angry  With the president  How's your debating  Skills today  I don't know  Let's see  All right  Mike in Jersey  Mike  Hey Anthony  I'm so sick  Of your hypocrisy  All right  Let me hear why  Okay  One second  One second  Okay  Oh it's  Stop him in his tracks  Jim  What's the problem sir  Let me hear you  Okay  Every day  It is a sin 
[01:40:30]  To borrow money  From China  China is taking us over  What are we going  To do about it  So now we have  So now we have  The chance to raise  Taxes on people  Making over  A quarter million dollars  From  From  35%  To  39%  Right  And that's  That's evil  That's going to  That's going to  Cause all these jobs  If we do this  Yes  Why haven't the jobs  Come over the last  10 years  And why do you  Not have a problem  Borrowing from China 
[01:41:00]  Right now  To pay for your tax cut  The jobs  Have come  They would be cut back  I know personally  I'm talking about  My personal  Life  As a business  I employ people  With the taxes  Going up on me  I would have had to  Not employ  As many people  It was a given  And you think  I'm the only person  Hold on  I'm answering your question  Do you think  I'm the only person  In this country  That looked at  The financial situation 
[01:41:30]  Looked at the tax  Being raised on me  And thought  I'm not going to  Be able to hire  As many people  Anthony  Yes  The point of it is  Is that we have to  Borrow this money  From China  No we don't  You know how we do it  We cut back  On government waste  How about  Instead of taxing  The shit out of people  We cut back  On government  Redundancy  And waste  And save money  That way  Instead of taxing  This country  Into a depression 
[01:42:00]  Okay  Then let's  Get rid of  The people  That monitor  The meat  The food  I'm not talking  About essential  I'm not talking  About essential  Hey dummy  All right  How about  We get rid of  The 20 levels  Of redundancy  In government  We get rid of  Pork barrel  Spending  That these fuckers  Are giving money  To their cronies  In each state  How about  We look  How about  We look into that  Which fuckers 
[01:42:30]  Who  Every one of the fuckers  Are doing favors  So they get elected  Next time  Come on  Where you been  You don't think  You don't think  Politicians  Do favors  For corporations  In order to  I would love  To come in  And explain  To you guys  How it's done  I've read  So many books  On this  That it makes me sick  I'm not a democrat  I'm not  But you're into  Just taxing the shit  Out of people  That employ people  What I'm saying  Is we have a deficit  We need to deal with it  The way we deal with it 
[01:43:00]  Is not to borrow  More money from China  So that  Not saying that  2%  I'm not saying  Borrow  And I'm not saying  Tax the rich  That's what I'm saying  I'm saying  Don't borrow from China  And don't tax  The fucking wealthy  You want to eat it too  That's what you're saying  What  You're saying  You want your cake  And you want to eat it too  That's exactly it  No no  I want half my cake  Because that's all  The government gives me  And I want to be able  To keep half my fucking cake  As long as you understand  You're borrowing from China 
[01:43:30]  To do it  Oh stop it  Cut back on government waste  That's the biggest thing  Not fucking borrowing  From China  Or taxing  The fuck out of people  That are employing  This country  Stop it  We'll see how your taxes  Are paid for  Yeah we'll see  We'll see  We'll see  And I bet you  China has something  To do with it  Can I ask you  Can I ask you  Can I ask you a question  As a novice  Are you really saying  That Ant is wrong  Or I'm wrong  To not want to pay  More taxes 
[01:44:00]  Like we should be guilted  No  Hold on  Let me finish my question sir  You're saying  That somehow  I should  I should be comfortable  Paying more taxes  So this way  The US won't  Be perceived as  Borrowing more from China  When Ant is right  About cutting government waste  So how about  Stop forgiving foreign debt  How about  Stop bailing  Certain fucking companies out  And put that money  To where my tax money  Would have gone  I agree with you  A hundred percent  That you should be 
[01:44:30]  But right now  The tax rate  Is lower  Because Bush  Lowered it  So  And he  He made it  So it's going to  Expire under  Another president  Terms  So that now  The Republicans  Can say  Oh you're just  Raising taxes  Well they're not  Really raising taxes  They're just letting  Taxes go back  To their normal  That's not  That's not why  Bush did that  Because it could have  Been a Republican  That was in office  Silly goose  Come on  How many people  How many people  Does Anthony hire  How many people  A lot  A lot  I suck his dick  He pays me  Yeah of course  And kisses 
[01:45:00]  And people can't  Take their medication  And yeah  Who cares  Medicine is for fags  It's for fags  I get it  Whitney  I listen every day  It is for fags  You know  No  I think  You really got to understand  Taxing  The people  That employ  This country  Is not  The way  To do things  Just as borrowing  From China  So  So what  What  You know  You know  What our government 
[01:45:30]  Is doing  It's keeping  Businesses  Whole  It's keeping  Businesses  That pre-exist  Whole  And it is not  Allowing  Any new businesses  To start up  In fear  Of competition  For the people  That already  Have  You know  The industry  Locked up  Okay  Look at what  It  Look at what  Tie up  It was to get  XM and Sirius  Together  The FCC  And all this other  Crap  Had to do  Stuff  And you see  Oil companies  Merge in  24 hours 
[01:46:00]  And it's  Done  Yeah  Can you hit that bell  Yeah  Debate over  Debate over  Just hang up on him  I don't know  Debate over  There's no  There's no fucking  Less government though  Figuring things out  That's where I do  Agree with you  Just cut back  You know who's  Making a lot of  Really good points  Here on feedback  Is a guy named  Old Man Dick  Old Man Dick  Oscar Butts  Oscar Butts  They're just making  Really great points  Oscar Butts  And Old Man Dick 
[01:46:30]  And Old Man Dicks  You know  Those are the  Scholars of this show  How about  Quit channeling  Limbaugh  Anthony  Oh shut up  That's true  How about  Michael Hunt  Michael Hunt  Why don't you tell him  How you play golf  With Limbaugh  All the time  Oh that's what it is  When are you going to let that secret out of the bag  That's it  My golf games  With Limbaugh  And Hannity  Yeah that's you know  That's where I get all my material from  Not from my fucking accountant  That tells me how fucked I am  Beary  With taxes  And not from 
[01:47:00]  Looking and reading  What happens  When you raise taxes  On people that are  Fucking  Fucking  Employing people  Beary  You think I could  Honestly  Honestly  I don't understand how people  Who are not in  My position  Can understand  My position  And I'm not talking about  Oh my god  Like I'm fucking  Stuffing my mattress  With hundreds  And lighting fucking  The fireplace  With all my money  Why  Well I am  But I'm saying  I don't want people to know that 
[01:47:30]  Well they know how  I'm employing people  Barely though  And when I buy things  Where do you think  That comes from  Where do you think  When I buy something  Do you think  It has to be manufactured  And it has to fucking  Be sold  And then that's taxed  Do you understand  I am helping this country out  And I'm being penalized  Fucker  Too logical to make sense  Sorry  Obviously  Too logical to make sense  Obviously  Too logical to make sense 
[01:48:00]  Flat tax  Everyone pays  You're a fucking piece of shit  And you make  Four thousand  On welfare  A year  Pay tax on it  Pay tax on it  Flat tax is the fairest way  To do it  For every person  Whoever came up  With a progressive tax  Is a fucking asshole  The more you make  The more you pay  Why  Progressive tax is sickening  Yeah but we'll never get  A flat tax  Of course we won't  Makes too much sense  Too logical  Yeah  Anything too logical  Doesn't work  And it doesn't keep  The class war  Going between the people 
[01:48:30]  So if the politicians  Can pit  The rich against the poor  The middle class  Against the lower middle class  You always have to have  These classes  And the only way to do it  Is with things like  Progressive tax  And it keeps them  Able to have a certain  Constituency  And battle it out  With other things  And pit each other  Against each other  So they can get re-elected  Ah  Boo  Do you all  Boo  When we get back  Al Pacino and Larry King  Had a nice little chat  Last night  Ah  And  How important is the wig 
[01:49:00]  Very important  Very  Very  Yeah  Ask questions  But don't think  Broadcast  But don't do the research  Look  But don't know  Who your guest is  That's right  Lick your eyes pussy  But don't let it  Wipe the guys  Come at it  From before  What a stretch  Unlike me  Yeah  I'm sure  I gotta do the  Merchant of Venice  On my tippy toes  I only sell things 
[01:49:30]  On the bottom shelf  Oh  This is  Cause I thought  It was the  Midget of Venice  One more National Anthem  To wrap up that  Dumb bit  What  Carl Lewis  We forgot about  Carl Lewis  The fastest man in the world  1993  He had a fine rendition  We've played this before  But we'll play it again  Because you know  We're talking about  The National Anthem today  Eek  So listen to this  For the ramparts we watched  With so gallantly streaming 
[01:50:00]  And the rockets  Oh  Uh oh  The bombs bursting in air  Gave proof  Through the night  That our flag  Was  Still there  I'll make up for it now  No you don't  Oh  Say  Does that 
[01:50:30]  Star  Spangled  Badly  Get way  You make up for it  It's a high note  O'er the land  O'er the lands  Of  The free  And the home  In person  Of the  Oh

[01:51:30]  Beautiful game  They romped the Pats  Well no no  I know  They got their asses kicked  But it's exactly what  Rex Ryan wanted to do  He's trying to trick  The entire NFL  Right now  What a genius  He's that smart  Anthony  What a genius  He absolutely is a genius  I didn't see that  I heard the team  Was really bummed out  When he gave them  The speech in the locker room  Said look  We're gonna fucking  Throw this game  And we're gonna  We're gonna allow them  To kick the shit  Out of us  And they're like  Oh come on coach  Oh come on 
[01:52:00]  We can take them easy  I heard someone say  Right  And they're like  No  Hear me out  Then the league  Is gonna just kinda  Relax a little bit  Thinking we're not  The front runners anymore  And we're gonna  March our way  To that Super Bowl win  It's brilliant  It's a fucking brilliant  That's why I love  This Rex Ryan  You'll see  It'll come out  On a blog  I'm sure  Puddle of AIDS  Is all over it  On tedwilliamshead.com  Great little sports blog  That guy has  What else is going on  In the world  Man  Yeah 
[01:52:30]  What else is going on  In this little  Little blue marble  As I like to call it  That's what we are  Turdling through space  Did we mention  Until we all die  Did you mention  How they figured out  There's a hell of a lot  More stars  Than previously  Thought  I forgot the number  How does infinite  Turn into more infinite  I don't get that  There's so gotta be  Life out there  It's so funny  How people  They don't understand  The scope of  What the universe  When someone just goes  Oh in the whole world  People don't even realize 
[01:53:00]  How large that is  And then say  In the whole universe  And people get surprised  When there's more shit  Out there  It's like yeah dude  It's the whole  The sun is 96 million  Miles away  And it's huge  And it's nothing  And it's nothing  I hate people  That discuss astronomy  Because it just creeps me out  How large it is  That I don't want to even go there  In my brain  Just keep going  Just keep going  Wasn't Joe Rogan  Wasn't Joe Rogan tweeting  About a big mass  The size of Jupiter  Just hanging out  Outside the solar system  Yeah  What is that about 
[01:53:30]  I found something  I try to avoid this stuff  But I follow Joe Rogan  On Twitter  Joe's pot addiction  I guess  That's what that's about  It's a big cloud of smoke  No but he  He let out a year ago  He loves his pot  But he's well  Well researched  He tweeted something  This guy knows his shit  About the universe  It was an article  About the universe  Never  Has always been here  Meaning  And I read the article  Actually added to it  The big bang  Was something that happened  See I'm getting creeped out  After a universe 
[01:54:00]  Had already occurred  And then I believe  When they say  When all atoms  Or whatever  Or all things  Lose their mass  Yeah  It makes them  Something like that  Meaning  That there are  Two scientists  Claiming that the universe  Has been continual forever  But how did it start?  It did not  And what was here  Before that?  It's just empty space  What do you mean  Empty space?  It's empty space  That had to be here  And then  But how did that get there?  The whole cosmos  Because it's just emptiness  It had to be  But who created the emptiness? 
[01:54:30]  It had to be  Because it's there  If we're here  It's there  We just don't know  What we're talking about  It's infinite  And never ending  And a giant room  That goes on forever  In every direction  But how was that  Giant infinite room  Created to begin with?  It's nothing to create  It's just nothing  What was in it's place  Before that?  Nothing  Because it was nothing  And it's always been  Just nothingness  But it's something  And then pieces of it  Fill up with stars  And stuff  But where did that shit  Come from?  From supposedly  A big bang 
[01:55:00]  Some kind of  Cosmic soup  That mixed together  Play along with me  Like alright  What was before that  And then you would  Explain that  Just empty room  And then what was  Before the empty room  An empty room  And then what was  Before that empty room  A wall-less empty room  Just that goes on forever  Of empty space  Of nothingness  But how did it all begin?  The emptiness part  Emptiness doesn't have to begin  It's just always there  But then how does it  Fill up with stuff?  Something was in there  And it  Why was that in there?  I don't know  A piece of dust  Do you understand  What I'm saying?  A piece of dust  Where did that come from? 
[01:55:30]  It hit another piece of dust  And all of a sudden  Made something  But how did the dust  Get there?  How was the dust created?  Big empty space  Wasn't dirty  It was a little dirty  But how does it get dirty?  Hoarders  Hoarders  Space hoarders  Now men  Space hoarding  You know what I'm trying  To say though?  I know  You can't wrap  Your fucking mind around it  The whole spark  Of where it all started  Brings you back to religion  And a creator  And all that  But how was God created?  He can't just be  Mr. and Mrs. Kumia  Fucked 
[01:56:00]  And their middle son  Oh boy  See I'm implying  I'm God  And on the seventh day  He said  Let there be  Alcoholics Anonymous  Please  Pot talk  Yeah  It's a little pot talk  And on the twelfth step  There you go  I agree  It's a little pot talk  He said boo  We  This article  That Joe tweeted though  About the universe  Never having  Let's see what  Hope was saying too  Jupiter sized 
[01:56:30]  Dark object  May lurk  In solar system's  Outer edge  What is it doing lurking?  What does it want?  Wouldn't that just be  An extra planet?  That's what I would assume  But they're saying lurking  If it's an object  It might not be  It might just be gas  It might be  Some kind of other thing  I had to make  A fart sound  For gas  Because I couldn't  Sound too educated  Farts  Gas  Gas  We got Michu Kaku  Who wants to explain  The history of the universe  Oh really?  Michu Kaku  Yes  Good morning  Opie  I would like to help you 
[01:57:00]  Understand  The universe  Imagine  You know nothing  About carpentry  Or houses  But you show up  And see  An empty house  That  Is the beginning  Of the universe  Oh  Now imagine  You have things  To put in your house  Like couches  That is the big bang  Ah  Oh I get it now 
[01:57:30]  He sure made sense  It's very simple  What's out  So what will you call  Outside the house?  Everything outside  Of the house  Are things you know  Nothing of  So they don't exist  Until you discover them  What's your  They have always been there  What's your neighbor's house?  You have no neighbor  Until you discover them  I like this guy  He's actually making sense  Though  You have no neighbor 
[01:58:00]  Hey a lot of fake  Michu Kaku's call  Thanks Kenny  I'm going to put this one  On hold  So we give him  A little code  So we know  It's this guy  Because I want to  Talk to this guy  I like this fake  Michu  Stay on the line sir  Stay on the line  Here's another  Michu Kaku  Check it in  Michu  Connect to follow  It's not Kaku  It's Stephen Hawking  You don't know  What the fuck  You are talking about  The universe  Is there  It has been there  Forever  Any questions 
[01:58:30]  That's all you give us  And then any questions  What a dick  And he's gone  Perfect phone call  Right there  It's been there  It's always been there  Any questions  Any questions  Any questions  Well I guess not  I think you covered it all  That's an entire  Fucking year of college  In front of a professor  Hilarious  There you go  Larry King  We're going to miss him  He's almost done  When is his last show  December 18th 
[01:59:00]  You really know  I think it is  So that would be  A week from  Friday I guess  I have no idea  Oprah's almost done too  Right  I think  Isn't she going to do shit  For her own cable channel  Oxygen  What do you call it  The own  Oprah Winfrey Network  But what is she going to do  On that  Herself  Talk show  I'm sure  I'm sure she just  Put it out of there  Goodbye  She's saying goodbye  To like  She's having to split money  With a syndicator  That's what it's about  It's all about 
[01:59:30]  The almighty dollar  I say  Yeah exactly  The big old buckaroo  It's in your purse strings  She's having a major  Goodbye year  And you're telling me  That the show  Basically will continue  I bet  Huh  You think that's  What's going on  Yeah  She hasn't really  Announced that yet  Maybe because she  Doesn't want to  Piss off the syndicators  Then she's not  Really saying goodbye  No I never thought  She was  I think she's just  Moving the whole thing  Maybe she'll tweak  The format  She had Phil Donahue on 
[02:00:00]  Going what can I expect  When I retire  And all that crap  She ain't retiring  She'd never retire  Maybe she does  Less of a schedule  Or something  Maybe  Maybe one of those  Some specials  Maybe she'll do  Some Oprah specials  Is Howard re-signing  I have no idea  No one knows  I haven't heard anything  I actually do know  What is  Oh you know  What's the word on the street  He might  He might  I was talking to him  I said  Are you going to sign again  He goes  Possible  We laughed  Made love 
[02:00:30]  Someone's saying  We got to go  Howie Leakes  Alright we got  That'll show us  Alright we got our next  Pair of tickets  To see Paul McCartney  Read that  Oh my god  That's cool  But see the other part  How would you  Fucking  Just fucking  Do the right thing  Once  Alright we have another  Pair of tickets  To see Paul McCartney

[02:01:30]  Oh no  That's very racist  What  It's terrible  Do you think the Sandman  Will come out  And give him the hook  Wouldn't that be great  Give McCartney the hook  Does his little tap dance  And comes out  Just hooks him  Comes out with a single  Wooden leg  Pulls him off  Pulls his fucking wallet  Out of his pocket  Here's for the new tickets  The new pair of tickets  My idea was  I said  Let's see 
[02:02:00]  If we can throw  A pile of shit  Onto a scale  And weigh it  Like a pile  Like from the bathroom  Yeah  Yeah okay  Like just a wet pile  Of shit  A big smelly pile  Of shit  And the company  Said we'd like  Something even worse  Yeah  So I guess  We've come up  With something  What have we come up  With Jimmy  Well I don't know  If we're ready  To divulge that  I don't know  What the rules are  I think it's  E-Rock  Oh  We're going to

[02:05:30]  With the curtains closed  I love them closed  I hate when people  Can look in  Mind your business  Fucks  They're called  Looky looms  Exactly  I hate the looky looms  When people look in  I just want to open the thing  And just go  Mind your business  Fucker  Celebrity working  Can you work in  Looky loom  What's your looky loos  Stupid looky loos  So what's the contest  Jimmy this is yours I think  Is it  Or is it  Not mine  Who thought this  Who thought this horse shit up 
[02:06:00]  I said it was you  Travis  Travis  Travis  How will this translate  Into someone winning tickets  Degrading Iraq  How does that turn into  Like tickets  Well we're gonna  We're gonna weigh Eric  In his undies and socks  And then whatever caller  Guesses the exact pound  Not point  You know whatever  Just the exact pound  Right  Do we round it up  Or do we round it down  Or are we not able to round it  No  We keep going until we got  The exact weight  No 
[02:06:30]  We should probably  Depending on the decimal  Yeah depending on the decimal  Less than five will round down  Oh I see  What if it's five  You guys will get  Then you round up  Then you round up  Hold on  You guys will get  An official weight for Iraq  And then the listener  Has to nail it  How about we just  Don't use the decimal  I don't care if this takes  All day  And then they will be  Provided with two  Tickets to Paul McCartney  Yay  Someone's saying  The contest should be  How long the scale screams  It's not that heavy  Shut it right there  What 
[02:07:00]  We have to close the curtains  Yeah  Who said to close the curtains  We can't have breasts  Oh my god  They got him so bad  Sam ran away  Sam ran away  Sam ran away  Oh my god  That ain't right  Very rarely do I see Sam  Almost not able to get out of Joe's  I know  Almost didn't get the line out  Do we really have to close the curtains  Yeah  Because of breasts  Who said that  Wait who said that  Yeah because titties are all over the place  How about Gary  How about Gary gets brave 
[02:07:30]  And comes in here  And explains why  The curtains have to be closed  For a guy  Topless in his fucking underpants  Well if we can't see breasts  Then when Gary's head is in here  We'll have to close the curtains as well  Because he has a head like a boob  Gary looks like he's from the future  Stupid egg hag  Oh god damn  And I'm heating up 
[02:08:00]  Because I tried to tag your line  I got so excited  And I said stupid egg hag  Well egg hag is good  That's it  Oh boy  I got way too excited  Why the curtains  I want an official explanation  Because this shit's getting crazy  And out of control  We probably could have you rocking his underwear 
[02:08:30]  Let me go get an official  I want the official explanation  Why the curtains can't be open  For a guy that's just going to have  His underpants on  See if you can have him teleport in here  It's like if  You saw somebody in shorts  Walking around without their shirt on  Yeah we're just overthinking  This whole thing  And it's very dangerous  That we continue down this road like this  You ever pick your wax and smell it?  Oh yeah it stinks  Oh god what are you doing?  I usually rub it on like a cracker though 
[02:09:00]  No  Yeah  Then it makes it too salty  And then put a little strawberry jelly on it  Nice  That's disgusting  $100 for someone does that right now  Probably not allowed to do that right  Fuck I'll do it for $100?  No consumption  No consumption is one of the rules?  Food contest  No food contest  It's not a contest  This is a bet  It is if it's money  I'm going to broadcast somewhere else  Gary's got a long commute home  Back to Area 51  Yeah 
[02:09:30]  The future  He breaks in a cold sweat  Whenever he goes by Roswell, New Mexico  Bad memories  Yeah  Let me see  He's a gray  Poor Gary  Oh that's funny  Come on  How's this contest work? 
[02:10:00]  I'm waiting for the official explanation  You got the official explanation?  No  It's coming  Oh it's coming  It's got a  Is it still being  Hatched?  It physically has to go down  In the hall  Are we trying to make contact?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Travis is playing those tones  Because the lawyers say so  Me  Ma 
[02:10:30]  Me  Ma  Me  I have no idea  I'll ask someone  Me  Ma  Ma  Ma  Me  Because everyone else hates this show  So they put me here  Me  Ma  Ma  So uh  Gary  What are the rules?  Alright  So it's  Are you saying  They gotta guess  Closest to E-Rock's weight  Or catch it exactly? 
[02:11:00]  Uh oh  No that's not it  That's Eric's stomach  Oh dude  That's not  This is the conversation  Going on outside right now  Oh oh  Really?  But then  Sam's on the keyboard  Oh  They're learning how to communicate  Alright  Well he's talked to the lawyers 
[02:11:30]  You can only mention it once  You can only mention it once  Wait a minute  Uh  No transportation  No transportation  They gotta get here  On their own  Cut from the replay  Yes yes  Cut that  First one for the replay  Uh oh  We've lost contact  What's the cut from the replay mean?  We can't replay the first contest in the replay  With the rules  Because people keep doing it  Oh my god no  People keep doing it  No  Yeah  Yeah  You can get stuck in a constant loop 
[02:12:00]  And it can create a parallel  A tangent universe they call it  What a bunch of assholes  Then all of a sudden  All the tickets are given away  It's like some Donnie Darko shit  Are you serious?  No one told me  Oh my god  I would never lie about that  What are they doing upstairs?  I'll lie about a lot of things  HIV status  How much I make  Whether or not I sharted  But I would never lie about a replay  So why were we going to waste  One of our good ideas  On a contest  That we can't replay  During the whole day  Oh fuck  Not only during the whole day  We can never replay it again  Not even in our own minds  Or to our friends and family 
[02:12:30]  Oh my god  That has to be wiped now  From the face of the earth  I can't even play it to a friend  Through a buddy booth hole  Which is how I  I like to go to a buddy booth  With a Victrola  And play songs through the hole  While a guy's putting his dick through  Alright so what's the official  Reason why  We can't even strip down  We can strip down E-Rock  But we have to have the curtains closed  Because he has cancer  Claymation  I know your legs are good  But they're solid  They're too thick  Travis 
[02:13:00]  Davian Goliath character  Davian Monolith  Sorry  Sorry  Erica  Gravy and Goliath  Gravy and Goliath  Oh shit  I'm sorry you are  Oh that's so bad  Go ahead  Sorry  So Eric in his underwear  Would not be something  You would typically see  Walking around an office 
[02:13:30]  That's true  So  How about if we were  At the Bronx  No aquarium joke  What's that  No aquarium joke  I didn't think of one  That's probably better  So why would that be a problem  Yeah  It's not nude  Too sexy  Well  Jesus Christ  And who decided this  They don't want the milk  Just to spoil  Gary decided this  The guy that said  Friday to me  That he tries to fight  For the show  That's hurting the show  He does enjoy  Your future jokes 
[02:14:00]  Does he  Yes  Well he knew them  Before he came in  We're not doing  The future jokes for him  I don't care if he enjoys  We're doing it for our audience  All this is for our audience  No it's not  So I can get paid  And get blown  The audience is incidental  I don't know how they feel  About this nonsense  I just want to put money  In my bank account  And lips on my cock  Deposits suck  That's how it works  Deposits suck

[02:23:30]  How much  What a face  How much has he gained since the last time we weighed him  Keep track of that shit  Travis has the facts and figures  The Lennon  Here's the Lennon book  And I ran out of improv  He rock weighs 97 pounds more than me  Oh  Makes it by yourself  Way to go  This uh  Have you been heavier than this?  At some point in your career?  I'm just wondering  I honestly don't 
[02:24:00]  You don't seem  I can't really tell  I didn't hear the first part  Oh  Is this the fattest you've ever been?  Oh yes  It is?  Really?  Yes  Wow  He doesn't look fat when his shirt's off though  Want to know how much I was when I started?  You look like a pile of Sanjay Gupta  He's on TV  What uh  What were you when you  I was 189 when I started in 2004  Wait and you're 
[02:24:30]  Wow  You put on 44 pounds?  Yeah  Oh E-Rock  Oh E-Rock  Oh E-Rock  Wow  What um  What uh  What don't you eat?  It's called stress  It works here  Danny was 155  He's 183 now  Holy shit  Well we're all sitting on it  What about Travis?  I was at 1.127  I'm about 158 now  What the fuck is going on?  I weigh more now than I've ever weighed  You put on 20  It's because there's a lot of sitting 
[02:25:00]  A lot of justifiable self-hatred  I put weight on  We all have  I'll put weight on too  No I was 165  I'm pushing 180  And put on muscle weight  It's all muscle mass with me  It's all muscle now  It's like a block of sinew  I'm crazy  Trust me I'm fighting it every day  I know what I weigh  It's so hard  I haven't weighed myself  And I've gained 15  I will not weigh myself  So could someone figure out  How much weight the staff has gained  Since doing this? 
[02:25:30]  Put me in for 15  I gotta be 180  I'm so depressed  Put me in for 15 pounds  That can't be true  What's your number Jimmy?  I'm not getting on the scale  No how many pounds since we started?  Don't know  Honestly don't know  I might have been  When we started  I was actually heavier  So you're about even?  No I've lost weight  If you see me on the HBO special in 05  I was a fucking  Alright so you're out of the equation  I weigh 180  I'm huge  How much weight have you gained?  I'm less now right?  I gained 10 pounds 
[02:26:00]  Alright I put down 10 for Ant  15 for me  Travis 30?  Yeah I was at 127  You're still a skinny little fuck  What about Samuel?  What were you Eric?  I was 187  Let's see how much  More  Wow you're contributing a lot  To this extra person of weight  You sure are  You're like the bell curve  We're all going to get better grades  Because of you  Thank you Eric  I always loved that guy though  In class  Thank you 
[02:26:30]  Oh yeah  Thank you Mr. Dummy  Big bell curve  My B minus is now a solid B  Big bell curve  I've probably gained 8 pounds  I think  All in your hair  So we're going with the 6 people here  Danny  Travis  Eric  Sam  Anthony  And myself  Roland  Oh my god  Roland has gained a shit load  He is the roundest thing  Has he put on weight?  Has he put on weight?  Do you want the Just Us figure without Roland? 
[02:27:00]  Or do you want to wait for it?  Yeah yeah yeah  Let's hear that first  Well we've made another person  With all  With all the fatness we've put on  Is it a big person?  In the last six years  No he's a little guy  We know it's not a bright one  He's a little guy  Cat sheds hair  I'd go  I'd go about 150 pounds I guess  It's under that  But it's 137  137 okay  We've collectively  Made a human being  What are you holding?  What?  What are you holding?  Gifts?  Holding like four Mexican babies  Hey  No in your hand  Oh  Warcraft  Warcraft 
[02:27:30]  Oh is it the new one?  Yeah  Cool  What's Warcraft?  What's it called?  World of Warcraft  He has such a hard time saying it  World of Warcraft  Let me see  Is it the new one?  Yeah  That's nice of him  I'll give that a try  Cataclysm  Expansion  How much have you gained  Since we did Satellite  Or since we met you?  A lot  About?  I was like 195  When I started here  Can you get on the scale  Or you don't want to do that?  On the scale  What do you think you would? 
[02:28:00]  What?  Bruce would weigh himself  Sure would  What?  What do you think you would now?  What would Bruce do?  What would Bruce do?  Bruce would weigh himself  Exactly  Or what would Ozzy do?  Play this game?  Ozzy would ignore me  He'd walk out  Probably  I'm guessing 295  You're saying you gained 100 pounds  Since we met you?  Yeah  Are you kidding?  What's up with that?  Why don't you come say that to my face  Little man  Let's find out  Oh shit  Remember Roland don't take no shit  I don't fuck with Roland 
[02:28:30]  He's a guy I don't fuck with  Roland's vicious  I will like  Why 100 pounds?  I don't know  Between food, booze, tears  Did you change your eating habits?  Or is your metabolism just slowing down?  I think  The combination of everything  Because I was like  I think I went  185 when I first started here  Yeah  I was walking down the street  With Roland yesterday  After the show  And it was like  A little snow in New York  Just tiny little snowflakes  Nothing  No big deal  Everyone was bundled up  And he was outside  With his t-shirt 
[02:29:00]  He wears his t-shirt  He doesn't own a winter coat  And the looks people give him  But Springsteen never put out  A winter coat  Were you cold?  That's pretty much it  He's just never cold  You come to work  In a t-shirt, right?  Yeah  And how cold?  It's cold today  People offer me jackets  On the street  They go  Can I buy you a jacket?  Really?  Yeah  Like a bum?  Yeah  People get weirded out  They don't wear jackets  It's just annoying  I took him to a Rangers-Islanders game  I probably told the story  But maybe for the new audience  And he lives sort of close to me  So I went to meet him  So we could take a subway  Down the garden  And it was a snowy  Fucking winter day 
[02:29:30]  And it was freezing  I was wearing gloves  Which I rarely wear  That's where I stop  I don't need gloves  And a hat and shit  But I had the gloves  And the hat on  Because it was definitely  Really cold  He's on the corner  Waiting for me in a t-shirt  Do your head not get cold?  No  I'll sweat  It's the weirdest thing  Oh yeah  Look at that  Oh boy  When I was with Carson Daly  I was 120  No way  Do you have pictures of that?  A video  When were you fucking him?  No  Say when you were with  When he worked for him  Say  No 
[02:30:00]  I was like between 115 and 120  How did we find that picture?  I want to see that  It was under MySpace  Yeah  Really?  You were a skinny little kid?  Oh yeah  Were you always small growing up?  Over there it was like pure stress  Like we  You had no time to eat  You're a waif  What?  Yeah  Is that  That's rolling?  Oh he's got to blow it up  Hold on man  Sorry  Oh yeah  Sorry for the people  That don't have TVs  Attached to their radios  Oh yeah  No that's their problem  It's a terrific technology 
[02:30:30]  Go to Best Buy  And get one of those  Makes the show much better  Does Gary say if that's going to be happening or not  In the future?  Gary  Yeah that was the Carmeletra one  That was like  I'll probably go to the team  I gotta forget it  Where's that picture?  Everybody gonna be alright  Everybody gonna  That's gonna be the drum solo portion of the evening for me  Where I get up and go to the bathroom  Hope I don't get mugged  Are there gonna be a lot of the people that usually go to the Apollo Theater?  Probably not 
[02:31:00]  I wouldn't think so  Whitey's taking over right?  Yeah when Bruce played there  What about security?  What do you think?  They'll probably go  Come on in  A lot of security?  Yeah  What do you think?  Yeah  Oh my god  The security for this show is gonna be ridiculous  Crazy?  Yeah  Everybody gonna be alright  While we wait  Yes?  Do you guys want to hear how much weight Eric has lost in the last month and a half?  Yeah  One pound  A lib 
[02:31:30]  In a month and a half?  Do you want to know how much weight Eric has put on in seven months?  But wait  The one pound  We never weigh him without his clothes on  Oh that's true  This is like the stock market  When you look at the daily chart  And then the monthly chart  And it's like  You look at the daily and go  Hey the stock's going up  And then you look at the monthly  And it's like  Oh  No it went down  Oops  So you're saying in a month  He's lost a pound  According to my records  Yeah  He's lost a pound in a month  But he has gained six pounds since May 
[02:32:00]  Ah  Not bad  No  He's  He's kind of evening out  You know what the best thing is though  That he has to look forward to?  Once a guy gets married  He always loses weight  That's right  That's not true  That's right  Has that ever happened in the history of men and marriage?  Which I submit to you now  Oh god  All this just to see Roland skinny?  Yeah  It's worth it  It's worth it 
[02:32:30]  I went and tracked him down on the old MySpace  But I guess me and Roland aren't MySpace friends  And his profile's private so  You're not MySpace friends?  I guess not  I try to become MySpace friends with Colin Quinn  And he's full  He's full up  Well he's a big Broadway star  Won't let me in  That would be I am Colin Quinn on Twitter though  Yeah yeah  I follow Colin on Twitter  I gotta see that show still  Oh my god  Now Roland can't get into his own lives  Well hello 
[02:33:00]  Hey Roland  Dark Steve's concerned  Do you have the sleep apnea?  Gaining that much weight?  What do you mean?  I sleep  Do you sleep well?  What do you mean?  Oh I sleep everywhere  Yeah he's gotten busted twice sleeping in our meetings  Well Roland was at my house for the Jets game  He lives in the neighborhood  You know  And all of a sudden he starts falling asleep  And I start getting the itch to go get my HD flip  And he knows  He woke up and goes  I'm leaving before you tape me  I'm like how do you even fucking know? 
[02:33:30]  And he fucking got up and left  Twice now he's falling asleep at our meetings  And the boss has said  You having a nice nap Roland?  And instantly he opens his eyes and says  Praying for your soul  Really?  He doesn't go  Hiya  We're still waiting for the Roland Thinpick  He can't remember his password  I haven't been on the MySpace in a while, huh?  I'll try one more  Bruise  It's all about how many you's is in the password  How many you's

Take a break  Maybe after the fucking break  That doesn't look like MySpace  I don't know  I've been on MySpace forever  I don't know what the fuck this is  MySpace is fucking terrible  It's nothing  What does their spam filter do?  Invite it?  It's like a fucking fly pest strip for spam  It just shows up  They blew it  But they're trying to change things up, right?  That's great  I catch up to Facebook  Holy shit, that's Roland

[02:39:00]  Got a nose job  Immediately  Oh really?  And then they show  The nose job surgery  And then  They drag her back to the house  Where the rest of the contestants  Are waiting  And they cheer on  Like, oh my god  And they start crying  Because they weren't the ones  That got the nose job prize  And then they have a big room  That says in huge letters  Recovery room  And then they go into this room  And hang out for a day or two  While the rest of the house  Is competing for other challenges  Do they all have big schnozzolas  Or something?  They all got fucked up shit happening  Like some kind of fucked up  Some of them need some lipo 
[02:39:30]  Sucked out of their  You know, some shit  Sucked out of their asses  Some need the breast implants  They kicked out a girl yesterday  That had chunks of her breast removed  What?  From some kind of  Pre-cancer  Or some kind of cancer scare  Oh, lord  And they kicked her out  Even though she had a great personality  They all said how she's a great person  And this and that  But they kicked her the fuck out of the house  Damn  And she was one of the ones  That really needed some help  To get her body back together  For the wedding  I guess she just wasn't good enough  For the show  Dude, the show is so sick 
[02:40:00]  Because the girls are crying  Because they're not winning  The procedures  Fatty  It's on E  It's unbelievable  E  And it's Shanna  Yeah, Moakler or whatever  Never heard of her, sir  Yeah, you did  She was married to Travis Barker  Oh, okay  And I don't think they're married anymore  She had a little reality show  And she was like a former Miss USA  Or one of those  But you gotta take a peek at the show  How twisted and sick it is  Hmm  Oh, yeah, she needs a schnoz right there  That wasn't the schnoz winner, though  Well, she needs one 
[02:40:30]  Maybe we could get some clips for tomorrow  Maybe Sam  Clits for tomorrow?  Yeah, some clits would be nice  All right  And maybe Sam could work on some clips  What was wrong with the toothy one there?  Which one?  Up in the upper  Yeah, that one  What does she need?  That was the one that got the nose job yesterday  Oh, wow  Cheyenne Aikens, 21  Does that scroll down any further?  Is that picture any longer?  Can you see her ass?  She was pretty hot  But she had a fucked up big nose  Which the plastic surgeon had to point out to her 
[02:41:00]  How bad her nose was  And when I take care of your nose  You're gonna even be more beautiful  It's a sick fucking show  Nose job lipo on a wish list  Yeah, they all have wish lists  I forgot  I don't know much about this show  Because I took a peek yesterday for the first time  Liposuction  There's one on here that's really strange  Outer thighs  Liposuction of inner thighs  Gums reduced  Shortened  Second toe  Remove scar on nose  Redo  Veneers

[02:42:00]  And the further they go  The more procedures they get on this fucking show  They get Botox and all sorts  So she could win more shit?  Yeah  What does this chick need?  What?  Which one?

[02:44:00]  Or giving it as a prize  In a contest  Oh  I'm sure they figured out  Some way  I'm sure their lawyers  Are better than the lawyers here  We can't do liposuction contests  Well, this woman  The one we're talking about  Her name is actually  It's Long Toes McGillicuddy  Yeah, the one wanted her  Toe shortened  Who is that bitch  With sleet stacked tootsies  But they don't even know  If the show  Walks around tapping  The bathroom floor  Like a velociraptor  You know she's coming  Get a clicking sound  She spits in some fat man's face

[02:46:30]  And I was trying  To call out Ethan  The reasoning is  It's so scary  To admit to anything  On this show  Why?  You can't just say  Hey man  I was watching Oprah  And  Yeah  And Oprah had  President Bush on  It was a great interview  You just can't do it that way  You have to kind of  Watching Oprah  You kind of have to  Weep it  It's like  If you're watching Oprah  You're just sucking a dick  Yeah you can't just say  You gotta kind of  Oh I walked in the room  And Oprah just happened to be on  It was on  The TV fell off the wall  Because my kid found the remote

[02:47:30]  Right  It's hilarious  These bitches are so callous  There was a cute girl  She had cysts on her titties  So she had her tits removed  You get nothing  You lose  Good day sir  Man  You are one pathetic loser  Go ahead  Yeah and so they kicked her off  Because she was a good contestant  Like  Oh she's way too smart  To stick around 
[02:48:00]  We gotta get rid of her  Some guy probably made a comment to her  Who is that city  That I can't say it  Yo cyst  Cyst titties  Get over here  Oh  I insist  Get it  One broad needed a clit tuck  By the way  Thank you Kevin from Connecticut  A clit tuck happened on the show  A clit tuck  Hey can we just play that clip  Is it worth playing  I don't know  I didn't listen to it  Okay so this is one of the contests  They did  The puzzle play  Ooh  Bridalplasty  It's worth a peek  On E  Hello ladies

[02:49:00]  Oof  Oh my gosh  Ugly cunts  I am terrible  At doing puzzles  In general  Now ladies  Over there  Is a tray  With ten syringes  As you finish your puzzles  You may grab a syringe  Go downstairs  Where Dr. Dubrow  And his staff  Will be having  An exclusive  First class  Injectables party  Right here  In the house  Thank you  Best show ever  Injectables party  Now you're in  It looks like it would be on SNL  Like a parody of reality shows 
[02:49:30]  Grab a syringe  So they grabbed the syringes  And they ran downstairs  And they had a big party going on  As they were giving them  Botox or whatever  Filler  I don't know  Whatever the fuck they were doing  Giving them all those duck lips  Yeah  The show is twisted  I'm telling you  They're pushing the plunger  And all the syringes  And one of those contestants  They're pulling it out  That's a creative meeting  That I would have fun at  I think  Because it's like  It's like  You know  Alright so the bachelor  They give out roses  And this other show  Gives out whatever  What can we give away  To these contestants  And someone went  Skim syringes 
[02:50:00]  Syringes  And everyone went  Okay  And now that's what they do  That's why we gotta  Work somewhere else  Because  That's fucked up  You can't even bring that up  Around here  People would be like  What's wrong with you  That's much too offensive  Right but they're getting away  Wow  Still you know  Very edgy stuff  Everywhere else except here  Except on our show  If we said  Look we want to  Make a little round table  Put syringes on it  And then have a docket  And then people come in  They pick a syringe  They go down  They'd be like  What?  They already said no  Three or four times  They'd be like  What?  Wait what? 
[02:50:30]  Syringes?  What?  It's an injection party  Yay  Hey can we get some more clips  From that show for tomorrow?  Because when they're losing  Their minds and crying  Because they didn't  They didn't win  The breast implants  And all that  It's  It's unbelievable  It shouldn't be too bad  I think there's only  Two episodes so far  Oh really?  Oh then I'm all in  I've seen every minute  Of this show  For long though  There was a  Coming preview  For next episode  Where they're giving  Somebody breast implants 
[02:51:00]  And the doctor  Actually goes  Look how she just  Engulfs these  Engulfs these?  Did her titties  Just go right over them  Real nicely?  Is that what he meant?  I guess he was very happy  With the procedure  That was going on  Here's Al Pacino  On Larry King  When I look at your credits  Just some of them  Godfather  Serpico  Dog Day Afternoon  Scarface  Author  Author  That great line  Do that line  The great line  Every day  Every day above ground 
[02:51:30]  Is a good day  That's an overstone line  My little friend  Oh say hello  To my little friend  Asshole Larry  Oh my god  Do you believe  He did that?  I was just  Completely embarrassed  Do the line  Do the famous line  How about  Glen Gary  Glen Ross  You fucking shitbag  Of a man  Do the famous  La  Famous line  I would have gone  For the first time  Together again  For a get together  To do it a bit 
[02:52:00]  Yeah  Why would he make him  Do that?  It's Al Pacino  You fucking  And he's not gonna  Do it like that  He's not gonna do it right  What do you think?  He's gonna put the accent  On for you  Larry  What a dunce  Yeah Larry  What a fucking dunce  Dr. Steve's on the line  And Roland  Wants to know what he has  Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve  So Roland used to work  For Carson Daly  And he's gained  About a hundred pounds  I guess  Yeah  In how many years? 
[02:52:30]  It's been a while though  Eight years or so  It's not like it was  Overnight  No  And you're saying  He has some kind  Of daytime thing  Well  That's just a symptom  He admitted  He has daytime somnolence  Which just means  You fall asleep  During the day  And that's one of the  Chief symptoms  Of sleep apnea  Is that people  You know  They think that they  Sleep during the night  But they're really not  Sleeping adequate  Or good sleep  So they  You know  Fall asleep  During the day  I have to 
[02:53:00]  I have to step in  On this though  Dr. Steve  Because he did tell me  He falls asleep  During the day  But it's only in  Management meetings  And I can absolutely  See how that happens  Yeah  Because I've been  In those meetings  And I've been  Completely nodding  Off  It's just something  That happens  In those meetings  They should bottle  That shit  They really should  Bottle that shit  The new sleep aid  Bottle that mess  Yes  I sit there  And my eyes are open  But I'm pretty much  Dazed and completely  Out of it  Sure  You don't think 
[02:53:30]  He's sleeping though?  There's  That's that  Coupled with the  100 pound weight gain  And his nasal  You know  Obstruction  That you can hear  Pretty plainly  On the air  The three of those  Go together  To at least  Lead you in the  Direction that  He's probably  Got sleep apnea  Well you know  What it is too  He gets like  A blockage  From mucus buildup  And it drains  From the nasal  Passages  And you gotta get  Something to do  To fix that  Or you're gonna 
[02:54:00]  Wind up suffocating  Like Reggie White  What do you need me for?  Yeah it's a very  Viscous thick buildup  Breathe right  Strip can work  We might want to  Go a little bit  More medical  Get surgery  I'm still laughing  About long toes  McGillicuddy  That show  I can't wait  For the next episode  This show is  Twisted man  Bridal plasty  Or something like that  I do those  Injection parties  Oh what? 
[02:54:30]  I do those  Injection parties  Who better to  Inject your face  With Botox  Than a hospice doctor  Yeah right  You deal with people  That are pretty much  Checking out  Well no I do those  I do the  Injection parties  On the side  Are you a hospice doctor?  Yeah he is  Is that where you  I didn't know that  He's a good guy man  I don't know how  You do that shit  I'm still certified  In family medicine  No you're not  Hospice  He just  You know  It's just the easy way out  It's pretty much 
[02:55:00]  You know  Hey what could go wrong  The guy lives  You know what  That's right  That's doctors  Who aren't that good  They always go  With the hospice  Because they're like  Ah what am I going to do  Make a mistake  That's the worst  That's going to happen  Sorry I said Tuesday  It was Monday  Sue me  So sue me  Yeah  Wow that's a hell of a job  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Rotting old people  That's terrific  I've spoken to Dr. Steve  About that  He says it's not  That bad  Yeah  No it's very  Not bad  Because it's fulfilling  How is it fulfilling 
[02:55:30]  To watch a dead  An old person die  Or a very sick person die  It's a downer  It's giving them comfort  If you've got people  Who are suffering  Are you the angel of death  Yeah you smother them  With a pillow  Here's a pillow  With handlebars on it  Steering wheel  Do you go in there  And go  My method is unorthodox  You think he has  An unorthodox method  Yes  Here's a pillow  With heaven express  Written on it  Oh never mind  Oh fuck it 
[02:56:00]  Yeah  Because you do that  And it pushes the nose  To the side  What  And there's a gum imprint  With teeth on it  And they know  You smothered them  You may not see it  On the servers  But the autopsy later  Will reveal it  Little teeth imprints  In the gums  You do these parties  Now what does this entail  Like do people just say  All right  Shoot up my forehead  Yeah  Yeah  You get  The thing I like about it 
[02:56:30]  Is it's a switch  From my regular job  Because it's basically  Young  Healthy  Good looking women  Who want to look better  And you know  You get five  Or six  Or ten  Who want to have  Some Botox  And you order the Botox  And you have them  Over to the house  And you know  Apply them with a little wine  Jeez  That sounds fantastic  And we just do  From the eyes up  So you can do  Crow's feet  Foreheads 
[02:57:00]  Those little lines  Between your eyebrows  That you know  The frown line  How about that one  Dumb line under their nose  Can you fill that up  So no more sound  Comes out of it  How about that fucking  How about that horrible  Gaping wound  On a woman's face  That idiocy tumbles out of  Dr. Steve  Yeah  I gotta ask this  Yeah  How big is your cock  I need to know  Yeah  Will you  We have a girth bet going  You sound like you are 
[02:57:30]  You sound like you might have been  A swinger back in the day  Yeah  I was a fun party guy  You know  Years and years ago  But I'm just  He would have swing parties  Like  But it wasn't a traditional  Swing party  Him and five friends  Would fuck somebody  In a coma  Oh shit  I'm making myself giggle  I'm sorry Dr. Steve  I'm tired  Of course  Dr. Steve  You notice 
[02:58:00]  At the heart of your push  Your head moves up  On a pillow  Are you mad at me  I don't mean that  Shake that corpse  You're a good man  From yesterday  The bear  Right  Alright  Alright Dr. Steve  We have three minutes  To kill  Oh boy  You know this show  Too much  Hey  Is Roland going to be okay  What has he got to do  Well  We love the Roland  He's helped the show  Tremendously  In the last month or so  Absolutely  And one of the things is  Is that if he did have  Sleep apnea 
[02:58:30]  And got it treated  A lot of his weight  Would come off  Pretty quickly  And it's just a suspicion  Just from the things  That he said  And the way that he sounds  I got to jump in  We'll get serious  For a second  So people that are  Overweight  And they take care  Of their sleep apnea  The weight falls off  Them quickly  How is that?  Well because it's  Harder to lose it  When you're living  Half your life  As an anaerobe  In other words  With somebody who is  Not living with  As much oxygen  As they're supposed to 
[02:59:00]  You know at night  Some of these people  With sleep apnea  They're oxygenable  Did you hang up on me?  No right here  That is so funny  You panicky feet  Panicky feet  Sometimes we do  Sometimes they  Did you hang up on me?  Yeah anaerobic slippers  It got real quiet  No sometimes we care  What you have to say  We were actually interested  Yeah continue  I will say though  That I think I have apnea  Really?  Yeah dark sea  Please continue  Half of their  Oh no  I really wanted to hear that 
[02:59:30]  Oh no  Of course  That's what makes it good  Dr. Steve  No  It sucks to hang up  On nonsense  I have apnea  I think  You're apnea  I'm always tired dude  Yeah  Does your chick say  If you like snore or anything  Or stop breathing  A lot of times I'll wake up  And there'll be a sock  In my mouth  And a clothespin on my nose  And she said  You looked cold  You guys  You guys  You guys are a comedy team  The fuck goes on in that house  I've been in Cunt Stella  Oh fuck man 
[03:00:00]  Alright Roland  You're gonna be alright  Yeah good luck  God bless you  You'll be fine  Aw Roland's just been  Standing there the whole time  Like this is great  Go take a nap  You gotta go take a nap  Are you sleepy?  Oh yeah  Always  I'm always tired too though  I feel like you have to  I don't feel well rested ever  You gotta wear one of those masks  That pump the oxygen  Into your face  I feel sleep on my keyboard
