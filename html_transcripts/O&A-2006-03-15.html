<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties involving the hosts' headphones, leading to a series of crude sound tests.  Studio guest Steve was briefly mentioned and teased about his weight loss.  A major portion of the show was dedicated to a phone interview with Sean Hannity.  The conversation focused on Howard Stern's recent admission to Hannity that he had "gagged" Opie and Anthony during their time at Infinity Broadcasting.  They discussed the listener reaction to this revelation,  the ongoing negotiations for Opie and Anthony's potential move from XM to K-Rock, and the detailed behind-the-scenes machinations Stern employed to silence them, including using their management.  Hannity's role in extracting this admission from Stern was emphasized.  The hosts then ridiculed the Catholic Church's shifting rules about meat consumption on Fridays, particularly for St. Patrick's Day. They further detailed Stern's attempts to sabotage their careers, highlighting his hypocrisy concerning free speech, and vowed to make his life "miserable." A caller to Hannity's show echoed these sentiments about Stern's hypocrisy. The segment concluded with a song dedicated to "man's men," discussion of their upcoming St. Patrick's Day broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe (featuring Hulk Hogan, Patrice O’Neal, and Bill Burr), and a missed call from Don Imus.  Throughout, the hosts used frequent profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

The next segment opened with speculation surrounding a missed call from Don Imus, with humorous scenarios involving Opie on the Verrazano Bridge.  The conversation then turned to "Stalker Patty," a listener visible via her PalTalk webcam. The hosts and studio guest Jimmy Norton mocked her living situation and questioned her use of listener-donated money, particularly her purchase of a PalTalk camera and premium account.  They threatened to sue her for misappropriation of funds.  Patty revealed her unemployment, a Starbucks interview, and her recent firing from Godiva Chocolates, eventually vaguely admitting to rudeness towards a client.  Norton then presented gifts:  WWII-era newspapers with racially charged advertisements and boxing gloves and a hat signed by several boxing legends (including Jake LaMotta, Larry Holmes, and Emile Griffith).  A debate ensued about who should receive the boxing gear, culminating in a decision to hold a listener poll.  The segment concluded with further mockery of Stalker Patty and encouragement to explore adult content rooms on PalTalk.  The conversation was filled with homophobic and racist slurs in addition to other crude and offensive language.

A segment focusing on the boxing gloves (one autographed by Jake LaMotta and others, possibly including Jose Torres and Mitch "Blood" Green, and the hat) continued the discussion on who should receive them, with a decision to let listeners on openanthony.com vote. This led to tangents about meeting celebrities (Jake LaMotta, George Carlin, Sam Kinison), and challenges of displaying the hat.  Mark Spitz, a recently fired *Spin* Magazine writer, joined the show to discuss his career, new book ("Too Much Too Late"), and their shared opinions on musicians (Axl Rose, Black Sabbath), and the music industry.  They also promoted their upcoming St. Patrick's Day broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe. The segment ended with a discussion of Drive-By Truckers and a song from them, interspersed with further off-color jokes.

The following segment began with a discussion about classical music and a game to identify "Overture to the Sun," which they incorrectly attributed to various composers and films.  A caller from New Mexico shifted the conversation to current bands, prompting a debate about Miles Davis's place in rock and roll and a harsh critique of jazz music by one host.  After playing and criticizing Miles Davis's "Bitches Brew," Mark Spitz called in to promote his book.  The conversation then turned to Isaac Hayes quitting *South Park* due to a Scientology-satirizing episode, with audio clips played.  This led to a discussion of Bill O'Reilly threatening a caller who mentioned Keith Olbermann, with audio played, and a call to former Connecticut State Prosecutor Susan Philan to discuss the legality of O'Reilly's actions.  Finally, NASCAR driver Jimmy Johnson called in, discussing his career and dealing with paparazzi. The segment concluded with further discussion of O'Reilly and attempts to contact Keith Olbermann.

The final segment addressed the perplexing loyalty some people have towards Bill O'Reilly despite disagreeing with his political views, leading to a discussion of how political affiliation influences relationships.  A caller then discussed his MySpace account and his top eight friends, which included inanimate objects.  The hosts praised Stephen Colbert's *Colbert Report*, contrasting it negatively with Nick DiPaolo's unpicked-up pilot, suggesting a bias against non-liberal viewpoints on Comedy Central. They compared Colbert to Andy Kaufman. A call from "Keith the cop" followed, discussing New York State Penal Law regarding aggravated harassment in relation to the show's phone calls. The segment concluded with announcements about upcoming events, including the listener poll for the Jake LaMotta memorabilia, Jim Norton's MySpace page, Jim Florentine’s appearance at the Stress Factory, and brief mentions of Ice Cube and American Idol.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Satsang with Mooji 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural  degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock, rock?  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[00:04:30]  Why do my headphones sound different today?  Why, why, why?  Uh, when in doubt, just turn them louder.  I'm trying to avoid that.  Uh, crank them up. 
[00:05:00]  How does your headphones sound?  Uh, they sound okay.  Might be something a little more muffled, right?  Yeah, what's that about?  I don't know.  I sound okay, I think.  Yeah, it's something slightly not as sharp, not as bright.  It's like, uh, a little more bass.  A little more bass.  What happened there, Mars?  This might be annoying.  Any adjustments made to the headphones?  What's that?  The old adjustments.  What?  I reverted back to the old adjustments.  Is there a reason? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, there weren't, um, something changed, um, yesterday.  I don't know why, but there was, uh, there was some change, and they had to reboot it and reestablish the old settings.  Ah.  Hmm.  I gotta just turn it louder.  All right.  Fuck it.  Guess in, uh, three, four days, we won't notice.  I guess someone has decided that we need to, uh, do this.  The headphones weren't right for us.  We were very happy for a very long time, and, uh, ah, ah, they've been happy for, for too long. 
[00:06:00]  I kinda liked them the way they were.  Let's fuck them up a little bit.  A little bright.  A little muffled.  Yeah, I don't like this at all.  It's, it's muffled, it's bassier, there's nothing going on here.  You know how I test my headphones?  This is a good test.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  How is that?  It kind of gives you just, like, a wide variety of sound.  Yeah.  I don't mean to annoy the listeners.  Is it good, though, for you? 
[00:06:30]  It works well.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Oh, is that horrid?  Ha!  What's up, Steve?  Oh, not much.  That was a lovely noise.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I'm just trying to test the headphones.  I didn't realize how loud the headphones were until I put them on.  How are yours?  Oh, they're lovely now.  Thank you.  Got a sound you want to make?  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  You can test the R's out?  No, I'm sure you could make that one for me.  Oh, E-Rock's trying to get a body shot of Steve on Pal Talk. 
[00:07:00]  You really did look good, man.  You definitely lost a lot of weight.  Thank you, fella.  I'm working out.  You're toned up.  Big.  I'll say you are.  Ooh.  Scary guy, Steve.  I'm just trying to get in shape.  Very scary man.  I'm just trying to get in shape.  Ha!  Stop!  It's so...  He's got to test his headphones.  Hey, we got to start the show off with a song for everyone out there that considers themselves  a man's man.  All right. 
[00:07:30]  This is for you.  He's a man, such a man, such a man, he's a real, real man's man.  He's a man, such a man, such a man, he's a real, real man's man. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, man, we got to cut right into our song.  That is a man's song.  One of our pals is on the line right now, and we want to say hi to him real fast.  We'll get back into the man's man song in a second here.  But first, well, he's a man's man.  Sean Hannity, everyone.  Sean!  Hey, guys. 
[00:08:30]  I'm running out with the kids, but they told me to hear I've got to make time for O&A.  Nice.  Sean, bang-up job, man.  You're getting a lot of props for your Howard interview.  You know, look, he's a very interesting guy to me, you know, because one of the things  I like the most about him is he was dead-on honest.  I don't know if you guys know, but I asked him about you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  You heard the clip.  It's not like that's the reason why you're on our phone right now. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, okay.  I thought you wanted my views on Bosnia and Iran.  No, not at all.  Well, I want to personally thank you because we were saying for years that Howard gagged  us at the old joint, and no one really believed us.  I mean, there was a couple articles that came out, but most people were like, you guys are  paranoid.  He would never do that.  Blah, blah, blah.  And you finally got it out of him, and we're very happy today.  Well, I'm glad I can help.  Yeah.  My job is to make everybody in the radio world happy, I guess.  How are your listeners responding to having them on? 
[00:09:30]  Pretty, pretty, pretty, like there were some people that, for example, when you guys were  on the program, some people had a fit.  Right.  You know, people thought I was too nice to you guys.  People don't understand why I take a very strong pro-responsibility, pro-First Amendment  position, and I keep trying to explain to people, I said, you don't get it.  If you can get rid of O&A, if you can get rid of Stern, you can also silence conservative  talk radio and dumb guys like me. 
[00:10:00]  So that's my overriding concern here.  But it was kind of mixed.  There's some people that don't like having them on at all.  They swear they're never going to listen again.  They think I crossed the line.  How dare I do this?  But they thought the same thing when I had you guys on, so it wasn't very much different.  No, you'll be all right.  They come back.  They certainly do.  You know what?  One of the things I think is kind of signature in my show is I like to have guys of all opinions  on.  Look, you cannot deny his success.  You cannot deny your success.  You guys constantly cross the line, and I keep telling you as soon as you get in trouble 
[00:10:30]  that you have a home to be interviewed on.  I like when you brought up the fact of the gag order, and he answered and said, yeah, I  had them quieted.  I had them shut up because it was a war, and that's how he reacts to it.  Three times during the interview.  We had a caller bring it up one time.  I brought it up with him.  I asked him, and I kind of pressed him a little bit on it.  Yeah, you did.  It was great.  You did a great job with that.  But I don't think he was being completely honest as far as that's concerned because  we worked for the same company.  We were in afternoons. 
[00:11:00]  He was in mornings, so there was no direct competition.  Anthony, I remember listening to you one day, and you were like a big fan of his.  And I said that to him.  I said, you know, I know you guys were fans of his, so I don't know why there was some  conflict there.  You and I have discussed this before, that the perfect station would have been him in  the morning and you guys in the afternoon, and thank God for me that never happened.  And that was happening in other markets, by the way.  Yeah, it was.  By the way, I've got to break some news here.  All right.  Any truth to the rumor about K-Rock in the morning? 
[00:11:30]  Let's say they're...  All right, now here it comes.  Bill Clinton Jr., I can hear it.  Yeah.  Come on, answer the question.  We have been negotiating with them for a few weeks now, yes.  So they're so disappointed with David Lee Roth that you think he's on his last day?  Well, we've got some major hurdles that have occurred, though, now.  We would never compromise the integrity, if that's an odd word to use for this program, 
[00:12:00]  but we see it that way, the integrity of the satellite radio program that people have  enjoyed now for a while over a year and a half.  And is that going to be amenable to that?  That's the things that have to be worked out before we go on any terrestrial radio station.  You know, this started about two and a half weeks ago, Sean, and when it first was presented  to us, it was a done deal.  It was a done deal.  And then you get lawyers going back and forth, back and forth.  And then it's like, well, it's a done deal, but we need this.  Here's this one little thing, and then this one little thing. 
[00:12:30]  And it's like, all right, well, we can handle that, I guess.  All right, it's a done deal, but now we have to add this.  So you guys had to draw a line in the sand.  Yeah, it was pretty much, you know, of course we would have wanted to do something like that,  but it got to the point where we were like, you know, we just can't give that much.  What are the odds out of 100 that this happens?  Right now?  That's a really good question.  We're kind of at a...  You're at a crossroad.  Yeah, we're kind of at a standstill at this point.  Now, could you confirm...  If you asked that question... 
[00:13:00]  If you asked that question a week ago, I would say well over 90%.  And it's to do morning drive?  Absolutely, yes.  On K-Rock?  Absolutely.  You know what?  So then CBS, when they came out with a statement...  There's something about Sean Hannity that just makes you blab.  We've been skirting the issue for like...  It wouldn't surprise me.  I mean, these are the people that forge documents for Cranial Out.  Right.  Jesus.  You know, I mean, we love being on satellite radio. 
[00:13:30]  And, you know...  They love the freedom we get here.  If it compromises our satellite radio show too much, then we don't want to do it.  Can you imagine the Sean Hannity show with cursing?  How weird that would be?  It certainly would be a little odd to listen to.  That would be a little odd, Anthony, don't you think?  I don't think it would have the same personality.  You know, as a goof, you should do that.  Just one show.  I'll have to do it on your show.  No, I know.  No, I know.  Just do it on...  Sean Hannity says the S word, the F word, right on down the line. 
[00:14:00]  You should do it for like an hour or two on just satellite radio.  Yeah.  But it's an interesting...  Let me ask you a question.  Do you guys...  Do you really not like him or is...  Because there was one point when I know you guys liked him.  I'll answer that.  The fact of the matter is, when we came into New York City the first time from Boston,  when we got fired, we knew you don't come into Howard's backyard and start bashing him.  So when he said that, I knew that was not honest.  We did not come into New York and bash Howard Stern.  We had listened to him compete with other people in the past and knew that's suicide. 
[00:14:30]  We're going to go into his backyard where his listeners are and bash him.  It wouldn't work that way.  What we did was we slowly built up an audience that happened to be his audience driving home.  Right.  We had a common audience.  He saw that somehow as a threat.  He saw that there was potential here for the Opie and Anthony show to get an audience and perceived it as some kind of threat to him.  Maybe it was because it was in his backyard, even though we were in a different day part. 
[00:15:00]  But we didn't start the whole thing.  Then we had to start hearing copycat this.  And we went into it very fun.  We didn't attack him as a human being or anything.  It was how we attack a lot of people through parody.  I would do impressions of him and how maybe he's not as close to his audience anymore  because he's winging out to the Hamptons and the Howie Copter and things like that  to kind of chip away at this credibility that he had gained with his listeners.  And it worked.  It seemed to work.  But instead of coming back to us on the air and battling that way, 
[00:15:30]  like he had with John DiBella and many other personalities across the country.  I think the most brutal was with Mancow.  We were talking about it.  Oh, yeah.  That was another brutal one.  But he went behind the scenes this time.  This is something that his listeners, if he's so honest and he always put things on the air  and always would confront people on the air, he didn't.  He went behind the scenes to Mel Karmas in himself and had Mel drag us into his office  and threaten us with firing if we did not stop talking about him.  That is how that gag order got put in place. 
[00:16:00]  You've got to give him credit.  He didn't dodge it when he was asked about it.  Well, no, no.  Years later.  Let me look at my watch and see how long this has been.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Sean, this gag order went down well over five years ago, four or five years ago.  And I was listening to your order on you, too, because I was actually up against you.  But it didn't work.  You were doing very well.  Sean, I was listening to your show yesterday, and that's what was so confusing.  It's like, yeah, when it comes to competition.  And I'm like, how are you ass?  We work for the same guy.  We weren't your competition.  Yeah, do you think he would have sat there or been okay with it if Don Imus, 
[00:16:30]  when he first came to New York, when Howard first came to New York, Don Imus put a gag order on him?  Look, I'm not defending anybody.  I'm not getting involved.  But here's the point.  He did say, anybody that I view as my competition, absolutely I want to silence them.  I mean, he couldn't have been more clear about it.  I mean, he didn't.  How is he viewing us as his competition is what I want to say.  Well, you know, this may be a shock to you guys, but you guys do get massive ratings when you're on the radio. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, but he was getting his massive ratings in the morning.  We were getting our massive ratings in the afternoon.  And it was the same goddamn audience, man.  And they said something like, back in the day, that we shared something like 75% of the audience.  I might be getting that a little wrong.  75% cum duplication.  That's almost unprecedented in radio.  Yeah, well, that's what was told to us.  If it's a little lower, it's a little lower.  I don't want to, like, misrepresent the numbers here.  That's what was told to us.  You know, look, off the air, he's as nice a guy as can be. 
[00:17:30]  That's what I've heard.  He, you know, it's funny because I know you guys off the air, too.  And, you know, people ask me about you two all the time.  And I tell everybody, you know, you guys are really nice guys.  And you're smart and you're funny.  And, you know, that some of the stuff you do is just outrageous because you just got this crazy side of you.  And, you know, I say, I'm just waiting for the call.  Well, okay, we're available now.  We're in trouble again.  No, please.  Yeah.  I'll never forget Opie apologizing sort of kind of on my show. 
[00:18:00]  He's like, I apologize, but I really don't want to.  No, I didn't want to.  That's all right, Sean.  We've all gotten the same apology here on the show.  Is that right there on occasion?  On occasion, definitely.  Yeah, by the way, what you did to that poor girl when you threw the stuff off, what was that?  Oh, that was awful.  Wait, what?  What did we do?  I was listening one day and you had this girl on and, like, you knocked her, I don't know, chest pieces off.  Yeah, she brought a present in.  This was a while ago, and Opie threw poker chips at her. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, that was awful.  I think it was an angry day he had.  No, no, it wasn't an angry day.  Her presents were awful.  They're from a garage sale.  Her presents bothered you.  The gift that she gave you that out of love bothered you.  Yeah.  Why can't it just be the meaning that counts with Opie?  I don't know.  Oh, where's the present she gave you?  I don't know, but I did not throw it at her.  I'm sure it didn't make it into your new house that you just moved into.  Nothing did.  No.  I got to take the kids to school, but listen, if you guys end up, you know, staying on XM and doing Morning Terrestrial, that'd be a heck of a development for radio. 
[00:19:00]  Well, that's the puzzle that needs to be figured out, and that's why we don't have an announcement.  I think I got more out of you guys than you wanted to say.  That's all right.  Let him talk.  Let him talk.  Sean does that.  All right, man.  All right, guys.  Have a good day, man.  Sean, what channel on XM are you on?  Oh, boy.  Well, because I use 124, is it?  Yeah.  124 this afternoon with Sean Hannity.  The right wing channel.  All right.  We want to talk about religion with you a little bit today because they're changing the rules about eating meat on Friday. 
[00:19:30]  I'm sure you're going to get into this on your show.  For St. Paddy's Day.  You can't change the rules.  No meat.  You go all the way or forget it.  Well, yeah, I don't think religion is something that you can kind of put a gray area.  All of a sudden, I think God decided that sex outside of marriage is okay.  Did he?  Yeah.  It is not.  Really fast because we'll give you some show prep today.  You should get into this on your show because...  Yeah, a couple of cardinals in a few areas in Jersey, Passaic and around that area are telling people that because St. Paddy's Day is on a Friday and corned beef and cabbage is such a big thing and a lot of Catholics. 
[00:20:00]  Don't you guys think St. Paddy's and churches and all that stuff ought to be taboo now for you guys?  Well, we're trying to slowly get ourselves back in the good light.  Yeah, we're kind of just trying to wean ourselves off that stuff slowly.  Yeah, we're trying to get back into the good graces.  We're trying to, you know, stay clean.  I'm going to like Dwight Goodman for the 400th time.  Yeah, good luck to you.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Sean.  Bye, Mr. Hannity.  He is the man, Sean Hannity. 
[00:20:30]  You know the weird thing that they were talking about, too, like with the meat, with the religion?  Did you hear that there was now a lot of the...  They're trying to be moderate, some of the Christians, and they're going that, okay, Christ may have been the son of God.  We're not sure.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He might have been.  Possible.  You know, murder.  Yeah, you could kill someone, but you need a good reason.  The meat thing, we all looked at it as pretty ridiculous growing up as a Catholic, but religious rules are religious rules. 
[00:21:00]  How ridiculous religion is, it's this belief in something you don't know, whatever.  For how ridiculous it is, I think the rules of religion should be the ones that there is no gray area.  However this is written, that's how it should be.  Yeah, humans should not be changing the...  This is God's word.  The rules that were handed down from the mountaintop.  You can't change them for your convenience, and it's happened throughout the ages.  Now, I might not agree with them, and that's why I'm not like this practicing Catholic, but you can't then bend the rules, because as St. Paddy's Day falls on a Friday this year, let's allow them to eat the corned beef. 
[00:21:30]  And it's the old gag, there's someone in hell because they ate meat on Friday.  Yeah, and didn't repent.  But I ate meat on Friday, and I'm in hell.  So now other people are eating...  And they're on earth eating meat this year.  And they're okay because they got this special dispensation for the day.  Logically, it doesn't make sense. 
[00:22:00]  No.  And then they were saying you can make it up on a later day where you can eat meat, just cut back on me.  It's like a diet plan.  It's like a God diet plan.  It's like you can kill someone if you save a life somewhere down the road.  Yeah, somewhere down the road.  And then it all evens out.  Is that what they're saying?  Ridiculous.  I just follow the good book.  You know what?  Take them literally from like right when they published their first book.  I'm talking burning eyes out, hand for hand type things. 
[00:22:30]  Gays, sorry, you ain't got a chance in hell in this one.  Oh, yes, you do.  Well, you do got a good chance in hell.  But they bend the rules for political correctness, to make life more convenient or easier for people.  To get more people to believe.  More people to believe.  Yeah, if it's too inconvenient to get a lot of people.  They notice the attendance is down on Sundays.  Drop off.  How do we get attendance up?  You think the church is there?  We need a promotion.  And talks about things like churn rate. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  We need a promotion.  The numbers are down on Sunday mornings.  The one rebel priest always has bad ideas.  Blowjob Thursday.  It's not going to work.  All right.  Well, let's listen to some other ideas and we'll get back to that one.  You know damn well the church does promotions.  My dogma was so funny with Buddy Christ.  Yeah.  That's great.  I think that's where I got that from because I was just watching that dumb movie.  Not dumb.  It's a great movie.  That great movie the other night.  So backing up a little bit.  Oops. 
[00:23:30]  There's something about Sean Hannity.  All of a sudden you just start blabbing.  I felt like I was on 60 Minutes.  I know.  It's like hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina, hummina.  I wanted to smoke a big cigarette with a long ash on it and sweat.  You ever notice when someone has credibility they could get a lot out of you?  Yeah.  If you look at the person, they're asking you questions and they don't have credibility,  you're like, ah.  Sean, you know he was taking his kids to school and he was in his Sean Hannity suit. 
[00:24:00]  He's in his suit and tie.  His hair, perfect.  Gets into his vehicle.  Children probably in size order lined up as they get into the vehicle.  You know?  Just like the perfect guy.  Still getting info out of you.  That's the beauty of him.  You guys are trying to, we better keep this to ourselves and he's fucking, he's combing  the kid's hair.  All right, what's the scoop?  And like you're telling him on the phone.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  There we are.  Blabbing and blabbing and blabbing.  Yeah.  And then like he let us off the hook, but I felt like we needed to just blab more.  Blab a little more. 
[00:24:30]  That's what happened in my head and I'm thinking, oh my God, what are you doing?  No.  You didn't say anything bad.  What's wrong with telling the truth?  It is the truth.  I mean, if everyone's talking about it, yeah, if everyone's talking about it, then you  gotta, you gotta speak.  Certainly do.  And, um, I don't know.  You know, honestly, I don't know what's gonna happen with that anymore.  It's not looking as good as it was a week ago, two weeks ago.  No, it's one of those situations where we can't really compromise this show.  And our listeners have been worried about that. 
[00:25:00]  I read the message boards and stuff.  I see it.  They worry that if we do something like this, regardless of who it's with, by the way, let  throw that out there, it's, uh, it's one of those situations where we're not gonna ruin  the satellite show.  It's not gonna be ruined.  Don't worry about it.  The basic, the basic sticking point was my new bit, um, about, uh, like every hour I  was saying that we should do like a whole big pussy fart thing.  And they were saying that wasn't going to fly in commercial and we fought it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That we figure is, uh, completely acceptable under FCC guidelines. 
[00:25:30]  I just thought I'd throw something cute in there.  Check your headphones.  Hey, is this true?  Just my volume.  Yeah.  Let's go to flying standby.  Flying standby.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Uh, how are you guys doing?  Uh, you kind of moved on a little bit, but I want to tell Professor Anthony a little bit  about the, uh, the no meat on Friday thing.  Um, actually, from what I remember seeing, and I don't remember my source, but, uh, and  I can take a look into this.  Uh, it originally started because back in the day in, in, in Rome with the Vatican, the 
[00:26:00]  Popo wanted to sell more fish in Italy.  So they made it no meat on Friday.  So you can up the fish sales.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's something I remember hearing about.  I guess.  The fact or fiction, is that a rumor?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Uh, you know.  Urban legend.  Let's go to Scopes and find out.  Where's Snopes.com?  I mean, Snopes, Snopes.  Yeah.  I'll look into it and let you know.  Find out because a lot of people thought it had something to do with the, uh, you know,  Easter and with the, uh, the death of Christ and with, uh, I mean, that's what I always 
[00:26:30]  thought it was.  Yeah, I think it had something with a little more religious significance.  All right.  He might be right, though.  All right.  Hey, uh, backing up just a bit, uh, we want to play the audio from Hannity's show.  Mm-hmm.  We want to play it with him on the, on the phone, but, uh, he had to get his kids to school.  This is the family man.  But, uh, Sean Hannity finally got Howard to admit that, uh, Howard gagged us when we were working  for the same company.  Yeah.  It's a very good day for us because, uh, the frustration we felt for years and most  people didn't believe and the Howard Stern fans didn't believe that his hero would do 
[00:27:00]  that.  Yeah.  And his fans would trash our fans and it was a whole thing that was going on.  And listen to his delivery on this too, because it sounds like he's saying, yeah, I did it  and that makes it okay.  Like just because he's admitting it that, yeah, I did.  It makes it okay.  No, it really isn't.  It's so not okay.  You're being a hypocrite.  You are being, um...  He was fighting the FCC and he was like...  Freedom of speech the whole time.  He was the freedom of speech guy. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  That's why this is, this is unbelievable news that he's finally admitting it.  Freedom of speech and he's making other people shut up.  He's censoring.  He is directly censoring another radio program where they would dump out of our show.  They, you remember how angry he was anytime they dumped out of his show?  Do you remember the anger that he felt?  Well, uh, we didn't like it too much either when we were dumped out of, and it wasn't the  FCC doing it.  It was, uh, Howard Stern's decree on our program that we'd be dumped out of, that we'd be silenced. 
[00:28:00]  Uh, and he tries to say...  That's hypocritical.  And he tries to say we were a competition.  We were working for the same fucking company.  Same company?  Stop.  We were invited to the same Christmas parties.  Yeah.  We weren't even in the same time slot as him.  Because, you know, these, these companies now, they own a bunch of stations in the same  city.  So, he might have an argument if we were doing moorings up against him.  Yeah.  Might.  Yeah.  But we were working for the same company.  He's making well over $20 million a year at that time. 
[00:28:30]  We were nobodies that just came from Boston.  It was our dream to come to New York and do, uh, radio in our backyard.  You know, being born and raised on Long Island.  You know, just trying to make a name for ourselves.  And here's a guy with all this power behind the scenes just making sure we wouldn't succeed.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me ask you about one other...  But then again, you're a white guy, I guess.  Let me ask you about Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Now, I've been on their show a bunch.  Right.  And they say that you would forbid them from listening... 
[00:29:00]  I'm sorry, from mentioning you on the air.  Absolutely.  Is that true?  That's true.  Why?  Why?  There it is.  That's true.  That's true.  Yeah.  And that makes it okay, Howard?  Yeah.  Just because he said it quickly and as a matter of factly.  Uh, then it's okay.  I love that his delivery right there was telling.  Because he said it, he knew he had to say it.  He knew he was now faced with having to fess up with this.  Because Hannity's asking him directly.  Um, and instead of skirting it or trying to, uh, make it seem like it didn't happen, 
[00:29:30]  he goes, I gotta say it, so I'm gonna say it like, yeah, I did.  Okay?  Now, next.  Almost like a cat, like the way you admit something that's very obvious, like, where  are those throw pillows?  Well, they're right there, I told you.  Yeah, right there.  Yeah, okay.  Like a very casual admission of something that's very obvious.  Yeah, I told you this.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  Yeah, I fucked her two years ago, I told you that.  Yeah, right?  Fine.  No, you didn't tell me.  I did, remember?  Yeah, I fucked her, yeah.  Fine.  Now, I admit it, it's over.  This is why we don't like the guy. 
[00:30:00]  He's, he's a complete prick.  All right, let me ask you about one other, let me ask you.  Then again, you're a white guy, I guess.  Let me ask you about Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Now, I've been on their show a bunch.  Right.  And they say that you would forbid them from listening, I'm sorry, from mentioning you  on the air.  Absolutely.  Is that true?  That's true.  Why?  Why?  Because you're a big advocate of free speech.  This has nothing to do with free speech.  When I, uh, in the business, in the company, and, uh, they hired Howard Stern imitators  that on the afternoon.  They wanted to capitalize.  They did really well.  I mean, they're very well. 
[00:30:30]  And, uh, love Sean.  We love Sean.  Love Sean Hannity.  Because then even Howard had him in.  Yep.  They did really well.  Yeah.  Couldn't deny that.  Howard Stern imitators.  That is getting so fucking old.  It's not even funny.  It's not even funny.  They wanted to capitalize.  They did really well.  I mean, they're very well.  And, uh, the fact of the matter is, I said to management, I'm not interested.  I'm, uh, this is Procter & Gamble to me.  I'm a, I'm a brand of soap.  Yeah.  And, um, uh, I don't want anyone not. 
[00:31:00]  Disturbing to hear a Jew say that.  I have a plan every time I go up against people.  If I have to go up against you, I analyze the competition, and I think about you six  different ways until Sunday.  And I turn to Mel Karmazin.  Thank God I'm not.  When I go up against people, you weren't going up against us.  It wasn't against us.  It wasn't morning drive.  We were in afternoons.  Same company.  Paranoid fuck.  And he's destroyed people that worked for the same company for Infinity Broadcasting.  He went and bashed the hell out of people that worked for the same company. 
[00:31:30]  So it's not, don't give the company line bullshit and that he's, you know, uh, it's competition.  Worked for the same company.  The bottom line was a lot of, if he said that you guys were imitators, the only way  to handle that is to do it on the air, face to face, and if somebody is so bad, then  you smash them.  Then you wreck them.  You fucking ruin them.  And if you can't do that, then you gotta go behind the scenes and cover stuff.  I think that's clear to everyone.  I got him.  He knew damn well he couldn't, uh, compete with us on the air. 
[00:32:00]  No.  So he did it behind the scenes.  I gotta keep going back to the Don Imus thing.  When Howard first came to New York, WNBC, uh, the Don Imus situation.  Imus was there.  Imus was the shock jock of New York.  You know, he was.  He was the irreverent, crazy, out of his mind, gonna get fired at any moment disc jockey  back then.  And, uh, when, when Howard came in, uh, he's the new guy coming into New York radio for 
[00:32:30]  the first time.  And, uh, if you watch his, uh, fantasy movie, Private Parts, you'll see Imus being played  off, you know, for a few seconds anyway, as this real prick, you know, Howard wanted to  meet him or he was brought in and, you know, he said, fuck Howard Stern.  Uh, Howard bashed the hell out of Imus.  Imus, Imus never went behind the scenes to get a gag order, order against Howard.  No, Imus just did what he could.  He took it on the air.  Did what he could. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Goofed on Howard.  Howard goofed on Imus.  Uh, but, and they worked for the same company.  What happened?  What happened there?  I mean, it's just, and then for what Howard did when we came into town.  Now, Howard's the premier shock jock in New York City.  Here we come into New York.  First time we're doing New York City radio as the Opie and Anthony show.  And this guy turns around and just gives us nothing but problems with management behind  the scenes. 
[00:33:30]  Gives us a gag order.  And now we're sitting there going, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  Isn't this the guy that's supposed to be the champion of free speech that took all kinds  of shit from Don Imus when he first came into New York?  I still remember when Imus lost in the ratings, too.  It was, it was like a ratings thing.  It was, Imus, if he ever beats me in the ratings, what did he say, I'll eat a dead dog's dick?  It was something funny he said he would do if Howard ever beat him.  And then Howard beat him.  And I remember the line of something, Imus was like, well, do you have salt?  He was like, he made some stupid admission.  But I mean, that was, it was an afternoon and morning thing, originally. 
[00:34:00]  One afternoon, one mornings.  And then when he finally lost that battle, and he did lose the battle, he just admitted,  I lost the battle.  Yeah, that's why we love Imus, because he has an honesty to his program, man.  Yes, he does.  And he has a sense of humor, and he's still having a good time.  He's been around a really long time, and he still has fun doing his radio show.  That's the key.  We have a blast doing this every morning.  Oh, we get angry, and then we lose our minds from time to time.  But in general, we have a really good time doing this program.  And that's the difference.  Howard's not having fun anymore. 
[00:34:30]  I have a plan every time I go up against people.  You didn't go up against us.  I have a plan against you.  I analyze the competition, and I think about you six different ways until Sunday.  And I turn to Mel Carman.  Thank God I'm not on in the morning.  I turn to Mel Carman.  All right, he said, thank God I'm not on in the morning.  And then Howard addresses it also.  But neither were we.  Remember that through this whole thing.  Neither were we.  We weren't on in the morning.  He was doing just fine in mornings, and we were doing just fine in afternoons.  He was number one in mornings in the demo. 
[00:35:00]  Well, in pretty much everything.  We were number one in the demos.  We were supposed to be number one in.  Where was the problem, Howard?  Except for your paranoia.  I analyzed the competition, and I think about you six different ways until Sunday.  And I turn to Mel Carman.  Thank God I'm not on in the morning.  I turn to Mel Carman.  Morning radio is the most vicious.  It's vicious.  Stay in this time.  I'm staying right here.  I said to Mel Carman at the time, I said, your two boys that you hired, who sound identical to me.  Yeah.  Of course we do.  I give them three to four months.  They're so desperate to be famous.  They are going to do something stupid. 
[00:35:30]  By the way, we were on New York radio for three years.  Yeah.  A little over three years.  And I think the gag order came after about six months.  Yeah.  So there's more lies going on here.  Yeah.  We're going to implode after three or four months.  No.  We did just fine for three years.  Okay.  If we were on for six months.  We'd have been on a footnote.  Right.  Please.  Do something stupid.  If they can't talk about me, they're going to go insane. 
[00:36:00]  Watch.  And he laughed.  And I've made other predictions on radio.  And one thing I know is radio.  But if you say, Howard.  And I watch them implode.  And I watch them lose their job.  But if you're a strong supporter of free speech.  Yeah.  I'm a strong supporter of my free speech.  All right.  Well, but that's the point.  When you say that they can't talk about you or mention you.  Right.  And you have the power because you're Howard Stern.  Absolutely.  And you're making all this money for the company.  Uh-huh.  Isn't that a little hypocritical?  Sure.  Maybe.  But you know what?  I win.  They lose.  Oh.  Ouch.  No.  That's it.  It's a game.  You know what? 
[00:36:30]  It's warfare.  And let me tell you something.  But they admire you.  I heard them years ago.  If they admire me, they used to.  All they would have had to do is admit it.  But they used to.  Well, they stopped.  So the fact of the matter is, their strategy was, Sean, their strategy was, let's bash  Howard Stern because nobody's doing it at the company and we'll look like heroes.  My strategy is shut them down.  Let's see what you got.  Watch them implode.  Okay.  And that wasn't.  So we are at war, huh?  Because we're winning now, Howard.  We have more listeners than you now. 
[00:37:00]  We were asked a bunch of times by listeners or people that didn't like us when we first  got to New York, what do you think of Howard?  You know, calls would come in and of course we'd take them and put them right through.  And there was an admiration there.  We were Long Island guys in radio.  You know, you grow up listening to the guy.  And there was an admiration there.  And, you know, if things could have worked out differently, it would have been great.  Fine.  We didn't start the whole thing.  Absolutely not.  We did not start that whole bullshit with him. 
[00:37:30]  We were doing our show.  He was doing his.  We started doing very well.  And there was a perceived threat there by him.  He saw you in the morning.  Eventually, he saw you guys doing exactly what he did, going from afternoons to mornings  and really hurting him.  Somewhere else.  And it was nipping out in the mud.  And the perceived threat continued after we got let go.  They continued to pay us for two years because they didn't want us competing with Howard Stern.  They knew what we would do.  That's a fact.  They knew we were going across the street to go to do mornings against Howard. 
[00:38:00]  Howard, and they didn't want it, so they protected him by paying us.  Paying us a lot of money to do no radio.  That's what happened.  And we had no choice in the matter.  We could have signed this dumb piece of paper we talked about yesterday where we wouldn't  talk about him or anybody else from Infinity Broadcasting.  And if we did, it would be a $100,000 fine per incident.  Right.  So we had no choice.  We had to sit out.  That would have been nice.  Because how do we do a radio show?  With you digging in your pocket every day.  I win, they lose, man.  That's dirty shit. 
[00:38:30]  That's only viable in a DeBella's.  Like, if you have DeBella's wife on, which she did, that's I win, you lose.  That's like, hey, stupid, she came on.  Tough shit.  You're embarrassed.  Yeah.  But there's something about you can't fucking go to the boss and tell them to tell somebody  they're not talking about you.  You can't do it.  When he would bitch slap jocks back in his heyday, they would fold.  And it was this, you would look and say, wow, Howard kicked that guy's ass.  Happened all over the country.  A lot of jocks went down to him. 
[00:39:00]  He would get on and just pound him and pound him.  DeBella's a perfect situation.  Brought the wife on, the whole thing.  It was just brutal.  Brutal.  But there was never anybody that fought back.  And I remember Anthony and I, we used to commute together.  And Howard started taking his little shots at us.  And we had a conversation on the way back to Huntington, Long Island, going, no fucking  way is this guy going to destroy our careers like he's destroyed other guys' careers.  We will fight this. 
[00:39:30]  And we didn't give a crap about the consequences.  We're like, no way.  So, you know, when someone attacks us, I think the faithful listeners understand this point  finally.  Someone attacks us with like a little pea shooter.  We attack back.  Oh, the howitzer comes out.  Oh, we're great at that.  Yeah.  We'll be the first to admit and tell the media we're great at fighting back.  And the first inkling he got of that, that we weren't going to just like pull a DeBella  and fold or a Mark and Brian and just fold without the ability to fight back. 
[00:40:00]  He knew he was in and over his head.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, now what do I do?  Well, I'll use the power.  That's it.  Then he went to Mel.  And I remember a meeting with Mel Karmazin and Mel's like, I just wish you guys would  get along because you guys are making me a lot of money in afternoons and doing great  and he's obviously doing great.  I just wish you guys would get along.  And I go, I go, Mel, that's not, that's not us.  We could give a crap.  Yeah.  You know, we don't, we're just doing our show.  Yeah.  We're not obsessed with, uh, with this whole thing. 
[00:40:30]  We're just protecting ourselves.  Right.  Wasn't going to be treated like DeBella and the rest and go down like that.  I'm having so much fun at XM Satellite Radio.  I really am.  Um, Howard is the reason that I had a miserable fucking time at Infinity Broadcasting.  Yeah, we were always being called in.  And, uh, you know, I started in radio at 18 and it was my goal to, you know, make something  of myself in New York radio.  And we finally get here and we finally, uh, start making something, uh, hat, you know,  happen.  And we were just getting killed behind the scenes and meetings every day. 
[00:41:00]  The arbitrage would come out and we would be number one again.  And it wasn't about being number one again.  It was about, you know, you're still talking about Howard.  You're still doing this.  It was, it was unbelievable how miserable of a time I had when, uh, we were over there.  And, and people can say some of the best years of my life.  People can say, oh, well, why didn't you just not talk about him?  Well, uh, we could have, uh, if the fact of the matter wasn't that when we tried to get 
[00:41:30]  guests, we were being cockblocked, you know, there were, there were other things going behind  the scenes where we wanted guests on the show.  They would be booked.  We would announce it because it's something you want to promote that we're going to have  a celebrity guest on our program.  They would hear it over there.  And all of a sudden the guests, uh, people would call and go, oh, we can't make it.  Right.  And then boom, they're on Howard's show.  And there would be some strange thing that would happen.  Oh, I missed his flight.  Oh, he, uh, came down with the flu.  Yeah.  But, and then, you know, the next day, but he performed at, uh, Madison Square Garden or 
[00:42:00]  what have you.  And he was fine.  It was all this mysterious shit.  Like, uh, guests were just, you know, canceling all the fucking time.  And we found out again, and there was an admission that, uh, they were telling people not to do  our show.  So he did everything possible to, to make it tough for us to succeed.  And we still succeeded.  And it was impossible for us not to talk about.  Like he said, he just didn't want us talking about him.  Well, that would have been easy.  You shut up about us. 
[00:42:30]  You'd not, don't cock block us.  Things like that.  There wouldn't have been any talk.  There would have been a respect and admiration.  That was the most amazing thing because, uh, we would just get beat up behind the scenes.  Do not talk about him.  We'll fire you.  We, we got dump buttons.  We'll just dump out.  And we're like, Oh my God.  And then, uh, we get, you know, word that he's just blabbing about us on his show going,  look at those pussies over there.  I'll go out on a limb and I'll be completely honest here.  Do you know how bad you have to fuck up to screw me up as a fan? 
[00:43:00]  Like I was a huge fan back when I was working in construction.  Everyone listened to Howard, turn the radio on.  The work didn't get done.  You know, you'd sit there and listen and look at the clock and go, shit, I got to get something  done.  But the shows were compelling, entertaining, and you'd listen to him.  Do you know how badly you have to fuck with someone personally to screw that up?  It got to the point where I was like, Jesus Christ.  You know, I went from a real big fan, really admiring the guy to, to seeing what happens behind  the scenes and going, what a fucking asshole. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, well.  That was a tactical error.  He was a smart guy for a long time.  With you two guys, he underestimated, or maybe he did understand how fucking, how vicious  your fan base was and how loyal they are, but he should have embraced you guys.  He should have embraced you guys and talked about you highly and pushed people towards  you.  And it would have been, why would you want to attack somebody who was helping you and  treating you that way?  It wouldn't happen.  It was just a fucking stupid move.  So now it's an all-out war, because it's not over.  No.  Because my whole goal is to make his life fucking miserable.  Trust me.  Because now it's, you know, we're on competing satellite radio systems. 
[00:44:00]  Now, now we are.  He's doing mornings over there.  We're doing mornings over here.  Competing satellite radio.  Now we're in competition.  That's right.  And there's nowhere to run.  You can't run to Mel.  That's right.  Oh, he's right down the hall, putting on his rub-on tan.  He's right there.  You little midget with his rub-on tan.  He's right down the hall.  But what happens?  You can't have him shut us up now.  So now we'll see what happens, Howard.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Because this isn't over by a long shot.  And we have more listeners.  Here's, really fast before we move on, one of our pests got through to short-headed  yesterday.  By the way, you know where that question came from, right, everybody?  Oh, yeah.  We have a lot of control in this business.  Matt in New Jersey for Howard Stern on the Sean Hannity Show.  Hello.  Why won't this man answer that question?  I'm not.  This is not what I do.  Hello, Matt.  How are you?  I think it is what you do.  Hey, I'm doing all right.  Big fan, Sean.  Thank you.  He's like a jackrabbit at home.  I know.  You're telling me the big fan. 
[00:45:00]  Wife's worn out.  Big fan, Sean.  Thank you.  I just have a question for Howard.  Why are you bothering, Sean, about his values?  I mean, there's actually people out there that take pride in their values.  We're having fun together.  We're having a good time.  We're mixing it up.  That's it.  You've got to learn to relax, Pat.  My daughter sees your values and sees all the stuff that you do and might react towards  that.  Who sees my values?  No, your daughter.  My daughter.  Yeah.  Well, certainly my daughter sees my values.  And is going to react upon.  I mean, me and my friend Ramona are sitting here listening to this. 
[00:45:30]  And also, you mentioned one other thing.  I don't mean to go off.  But you mentioned one other thing about censorship.  No, Sean mentioned censorship.  Okay.  And you put a gag order on O.P. and Anthony.  That's right.  That's right.  What's the problem?  You're censoring somebody.  That's right.  Do you believe in censorship?  I do.  I believe in censoring anyone who's my enemy.  You said you don't believe in censorship, but you're a gag order on O.P. Anthony.  I believe in censorship when it benefits me.  I'm like Saddam Hussein.  My world is very simple. 
[00:46:00]  Go against me, and I will take out all my weapons.  You know, you need me running that war.  Trust me.  Osama bin Laden would be dead meat.  That's the same mentality that the FCC has.  Exactly.  You fuck with our values.  You fuck with us.  And we will pull out our weapons and silence you.  This is censorship based on their own morality.  He's been complaining the whole time that the individual members of the FCC were putting  their morality on his program instead of interpreting FCC law and then directing it towards the show. 
[00:46:30]  They were taking their own personal morality as members of the FCC and implementing that  on his program.  Hello?  It's exactly what you did.  See, and I wouldn't even have...  If you're pulling out...  You want to say all is fair in love and war?  If you admit that on the air the whole time, that's a different...  If you say, yeah, this is part of what I do.  Yeah, I'm an ass.  This is what I do.  Go fuck yourself.  That's what I do.  Now what are you going to do?  If you come out and tell the listeners that and you're very honest from the very beginning, 
[00:47:00]  then there's something to be said for that.  But when you hide it and pretend it's not happening, that's just...  And when your whole thing...  The biggest thing that he has been known for over the years is to be this champion of  free speech.  He's one of the downtrodden, the oppressed.  And he's out there fighting the good fight for everybody for free speech.  And then, oh, yeah, yeah, I shut him up.  Yeah, why?  What do you want? 
[00:47:30]  I want to know why you're such a hypocrite.  Yeah, that audio is going to end up hurting him big time.  Yep.  Big time.  Have fun.  All right.  So there you go.  That was a big day for us yesterday.  Thanks to Sean Hannity once again for getting into that discussion.  At least his presence over there is driving the stock price up.  Oops.  52-week low for Sirius Satellite Radio.  They were worried about it dipping into the fours. 
[00:48:00]  It is now way through the fours.  Was it nine-something at one point?  4.45.  Who bought it nine-something?  Anybody?  I want to laugh at you.  I'll be who didn't.  I was waiting for it to hit 10.50.  I bought some at, I think, like five and change at one point, and I still own it.  I don't care, though.  I don't care.  No, you know what it is?  It's so bittersweet because if it goes up, I make money, but if it goes down, I get to  go. 
[00:48:30]  And you know why you don't care, Anthony?  Why?  Because you are a man's man.  I'm a man's man.  I only wish there was a theme that I could have that could play when I felt like such  a man.  When you're drinking your Miller Lights.  Right.  Let me pop open a Miller Light.  And checking your stocks.  And, uh, no, that's kind of geeky.  Checking my stock cars.  That's a man's man.  Ah, very good.  You're learning.  A little Miller Light, a little stock car racing, chasing broads, and maybe hearing  a song. 
[00:49:00]  Is there a song that would-  Absolutely there is.  To everyone out there that considers themselves a man's man, this one's for you.  Yeah.  Turn it up.  Work whistle.  He's a man.  Yeah.  Such a man.  Such a man.  He's a real, a real man's man. 
[00:49:30]  You ever seen a grown man naked?  He's a man.  You like movies about gladiators.  Such a man.  Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?  He's a real, a real man's man.  He's a real, a real man's man. 
[00:50:00]  Gotcha, Melinda.  This is the man's man solo, by the way.  He's a man.  Such a man.  Such a man.  Sing it, everybody.  He's a real, a real man's man. 
[00:50:30]  Man.  No one made me laugh so hard yesterday.  My CD?  Well, of course, Jimmy.  When we were doing that whole stupid Bubba Love Sponge thing.  Mm-hmm.  Fucking phony.  He wants to fight me.  I told him where I'm going to be Friday, and he's already backing out.  Yeah.  We're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe for our St. Paddy's Day broadcast.  Show up.  It's going to be fun.  And it was getting all down and dirty, and I go, well, I want to respond in song. 
[00:51:00]  In the Culture Club.  Oh, I know.  I heard that on the replay.  In the Culture Club.  That made me laugh.  Dude.  That made me laugh.  That's the gayest song ever.  Dude responded like a faggot.  Faggot.  That made me laugh so freaking hard yesterday.  That was good.  Uh, let's go to Shane in Tennessee.  Shane, what's up?  Yeah.  Uh, O-A.  Whispy-ass.  I was going to ask you what your call was like with, uh, Imus there.  Oh, my God.  That's a great question. 
[00:51:30]  Well, first of all, we got the audio from yesterday.  I guess this is our other radio jock segment.  Okay.  Uh, this is Imus on his program yesterday.  No.  24 FDR here on the Imus Wayne program on the radio all over the country and on MSNBC.  Hey, Bernard.  Yo.  Ask Julie if she still has Opie's phone number.  I know he called me a while back, and I'll return it now, the call.  I forget when he was about a month ago.  Sufficient time has elapsed. 
[00:52:00]  Now I need to talk to him.  I mean, I can get him to come to their senses, both of them.  Yeah, come to their senses, both of them.  I love that guy.  He really makes me laugh.  You hear the sense of humor there?  Well, yeah.  He called me a few months ago.  A few months ago.  It's about time I returned the call.  That is so fucking a prick.  So, uh, there was all sorts of things going on.  There was IMs going on and phone calls being made.  Yeah.  And it was reported that IMs was going to call Ben's phone at 1105. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  So we're all just sitting around the phone waiting for Mr. IMs to call us.  The i-man.  And, uh, the i-man stood me up.  Oh.  Anthony gave up.  He had, uh, new house shit to get to.  Jimmy gave up.  And I'm just sitting there like an anxious little fella waiting to hear from Mr. IMs.  And I sat.  And I sat.  And I sat.  And I'm checking the time on my Blackberry.  Oh.  And I sat. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, poor Opie.  And I sat in there.  Oh.  How long did you sit for?  I was stood up.  Uh, about a half hour to 40 minutes.  Oh.  That's sad.  And maybe IMs was giving us some time to, like, wind down after the show.  Yeah.  You start thinking, well, maybe he was, uh, pulled into a meeting at the last minute.  Yeah, that's it.  Ill call today, though, I bet.  I felt like a little girl being stood up or something.  It was pretty awful.  That hurts.  So.  It's New Year's Eve.  You're looking at the clock.  It's 10.  10.15.  Well, you know, maybe there was traffic. 
[00:53:30]  In the mirror again and adjust yourself.  So, I don't know.  Maybe we can find out if Mr. IMs is going to call us today.  We tried calling him on his show, and he's like, oh, guys, do not do that.  He's not going to call.  But I want to hold out hope that Mr. IMs is going to call me back.  He's never calling.  He's going to call me back, isn't he, Anthony?  I'll be.  You've got to move on with your life.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  He's just not going to call.  I didn't get much sleep last night because I'm thinking about how the phone call is going to go. 
[00:54:00]  It's like you've got, like, a, like he's your big brother.  Well, it's good that we finally have someone in this.  The big brother's, uh, organization.  It really is good that we have someone in this business looking out for us finally.  Yeah.  I mean.  He wants to talk some sense into us, but then he doesn't call.  I think he wants us to shut up about the whole CBS thing, but then, and, and we were,  we actually had a discussion this morning, Anthony and I, like, maybe we should not really,  let's just let that lie for a little while.  Yeah.  And then Sean Hannity asked one simple question. 
[00:54:30]  We're just babbling idiots again.  That's fine.  You know what?  There's nothing, you didn't say anything awful.  So what?  Everybody talks.  Their companies, people talk.  Is it a surprise?  The guy's bombing that maybe your names are brought up?  What?  That's not a big shot.  Right.  Yeah.  You know what?  If, if Imus doesn't call, I foresee a horrible scene.  Opie in platform shoes on the Verrazano Bridge with, uh, Imus going, come on, come on down  from there.  Come on, come on.  You didn't call me, I, man.  Why didn't you call me, I, man? 
[00:55:00]  What are you doing?  Come on, come on down from there, Opie.  Opie, what?  Double J, get around and, uh, uh, try to get, uh, Opie off the bridge.  Look, uh, look, I, man, I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  Yeah, that's, uh, that's wonderful.  Uh, Opie, uh, uh, come down from the bridge.  Uh, yeah, you jerk.  Yeah, I, I didn't, I, I was busy, um, uh, with my own program.  You didn't call me, I, man.  You didn't call me. 
[00:55:30]  Come on, get back in the car.  We'll, uh, uh, we'll, we'll, we'll go out.  I, man, didn't call me.  Opie jumps.  See, um, now you're a cunt.  Oh, it was fun to be able to say that.  No kidding.  See, Imus isn't scared of competition.  Imus rules. 
[00:56:00]  Imus does rule.  Hey, by the way, remind me to give you guys little gifts.  Stop it.  You got gifts?  You do not.  They're my friends.  Read the right strips?  It was a big day for Jimmy Norton yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  I, I'm thinking he's showing a little appreciation today.  Wow.  Oh, no, this was before yesterday.  I just forgot.  Lucky Louie t-shirts?  Are they Van Heusen shirts?  I said gifts, not fucking keepsakes.  Heirlooms.  Right.  Ooh.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm so excited.  Does it involve engraving? 
[00:56:30]  What?  No.  Oh.  What, is it a charm bracelet?  No.  I don't think he's ever engraved as the word slut across some girl's chest.  Exactly, with lipstick.  Or a target, and then dumps flow on him.  Why did I have to go there?  Yeah.  Because it's real, and it happened.  I mean, let's be honest.  Excellent point.  We'll be right back. 
[00:57:00]  Another fine whip-em-out Wednesday.  If you want to see boobies, all you've got to do is slap a wow sticker on your car, truck,  et cetera.  If you don't have a wow sticker, you can get one by going to opiananthony.com or sending 
[00:57:30]  a self-addressed stamp envelope to Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers, 111 West 57th Avenue,  New York, New York.  Insert zip code here.  What you do then is slip this sticker on your car, and when the ladies see the sticker,  they will show you their beautiful boobies.  And when you do get wowed, give the Opie and Anthony Wow Line a call at 866-WOW-ME-05.  And as a side note, you guys need to institute whip it out Wednesday for us again, guys. 
[00:58:00]  The church doesn't allow it.  That's right.  We're not going to change those rules.  We're not changing the church rules, sir.  Damn it.  Well, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Can't you whip it out?  No!  My health won't allow it!  Does gay guys enjoy the old breasts, no matter what?  It depends.  You know, I don't mind seeing a good set every once in a while, you know. 
[00:58:30]  It's one of those things.  You see a naked girl, does it do anything?  Well, if I see the bottom half, it makes me vomit.  All right.  What about turned around?  Like, do you just think maybe it looks like a young boy's ass or something?  You know how gay guys look at a naked woman from the bottom down?  It's like when you drive through your old neighborhood, and there was a mall there, and now it's just a lot.  And you're like, wait a minute.  What's gone?  There's something not here that's just missing.  That was very useful to me. 
[00:59:00]  All I see is a lot of brush.  Where's the old Hempstead lady's house?  Old lady Hempstead.  All right, Tony.  Jimmy's right.  It's got to have the cock.  Oh, even the gay guys, though, enjoy Whipping Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  That's what we're getting at here.  Thank you, Token Gay.  All right.  Y'all have a good one.  All right.  Anthony had a very good observation.  This Pal Talk thing is taking over this radio program.  This radio show used to be just a four-hour experience.  Now it's just around the clock. 
[00:59:30]  Yep.  The Opie and Anthony experience continues around the clock.  When the show ends, you can go on Pal Talk or numerous message boards or anything, and it continues.  The relationship between the listeners and the program continues.  And they're hanging out at my brother's place.  Yeah.  It's like a whole thing that's going on.  They have a hangout online, a hangout if they want to be part of the real world.  Yeah.  But what I'm getting at here, you notice that Stalker Patty has a Pal Talk camera.  I'm looking.  I see Stalker Patty up there.  All in the corner. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Off center.  Her whole place is a corner.  I just looked at it.  It's awful.  It's horrid.  It's a horrid little cracker box she lives in.  And, yeah, Patty has a camera and an account.  And if you notice, she's got a green account, which means that that's the one that you pay full price for.  You get all of the benefits of being a full paid member of Pal Talk and a camera.  Now, recently, our listeners had put a charity together because Patty was going to be kicked out of her apartment. 
[01:00:30]  She had a bunch of back payment to make on the rent.  And the listeners came up with a bunch of cash and gave her money, which we made her earn by crawling on her hands and knees naked through mousetraps blindfolded until she found the checks.  It was fabulous.  So she got the money and apparently spent a little bit of it, I see, at least on a camera and an account. 
[01:01:00]  I think she uses us to be quite frank.  Look at her.  Now she's holding up her cat.  She's got her cat in there.  But I think maybe misappropriation of funds.  That's right.  I think perhaps we should sue to get it back now.  Let's contact the SEC.  And we can have the money taken away.  Please sue Patty.  Someone go and confiscate her camera.  Oh, please sue her.  That would be the greatest story. 
[01:01:30]  Why are you suing me?  A charitable event to raise money for her.  And she's buying luxury items.  That's right.  It's a luxury item, Pal Talk.  It certainly is.  She's living high on the hog.  Patty, are you doing other things besides just Opie and Anthony fan rooms here on Pal Talk?  Do you go into some of the sexy rooms that they have?  That's what I want to know.  She's looking for the virgin witches.  Put your cat down and type, you ass. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  She's going to crawl.  Pal Talk camera is technically ours.  I think E-Rock should go over there and just take it.  Take the camera.  No.  No.  Fan room.  There she is.  Patty, turn down the radio, please.  I just turned it off.  All right.  Let me come on.  I have been using the internet to fill out applications online, which has been a lot of fun.  And I'm on about five job hunting sites, too.  A member and stuff with passwords. 
[01:02:30]  Because you're unemployed now, right?  Yeah, but I had an interview with Starbucks this week.  Yeah.  And they're checking my references.  And if all goes well.  So I'll be working again by April.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  And I wanted to work for Starbucks.  What I did was I got up and went to about 15, 20 Starbucks, left a resume, a cover letter.  That's wonderful.  Fabulous stuff, Patty.  Hey, Patty. 
[01:03:00]  How much was your Pal Talk account?  Well, I had a little help with that.  Have you ever heard of MafiaLife.com?  Yes, we've heard of MafiaLife.com.  Yeah.  Well, he gave me my account.  Oh, look at that.  Hence the free plug for MafiaLife.com.  Right.  And what about the camera?  The camera?  Well, Henoroso had an extra one, so he just mailed it to me because he didn't need it. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Obviously, this camera's from, like, 1999.  Yeah, it's an old one.  It looks like when you put a nickel in the Nickelodeon and turn the crank.  Patty does a little dance in black and white.  A little flapper dance.  I happen to love my camera.  I think it's awesome.  Your camera stinks compared to everyone else's cameras.  Why don't you just take Polaroids and hold them up?  Well, I love my camera.  Well, you're not even in front of it.  I'm looking at an old chair that looks like it came from the foundling center you were at. 
[01:04:00]  It's actually hotter than her sitting there.  That chair is from Little House on the Prairie.  Did Pa Ingles carve that fucking thing?  Look at it.  He probably did.  Look at that chair.  What year is that?  What year do you live in?  She's got an old tilted, her wooden bookcase.  She has a wooden bookcase that's slanting and tilting over to one side.  Yeah.  And she has to have a pillow on her wood chair.  All right, get the hemorrhoids. 
[01:04:30]  And that stupid cat in that little room, there's probably hair all over the place.  It's an animal dander.  Oh, Patty, does that pillow on your chair just smell like ass?  No.  I have to be comfortable because the chair is wooden.  Hey, Patty.  So are you.  Someone brings up a good point.  Reno from Mississippi.  You talked about the Starbucks interview two weeks ago on our show.  Yeah.  I said I was going for an interview.  I just had it this past Saturday.  And, you know, all kidding aside, she's a great employee. 
[01:05:00]  Very dedicated.  Very dedicated employee.  Very simple.  And I'm going to be very good for Starbucks, too.  You would be great for Starbucks.  Because most of the Starbucks people I've run into lately have such an attitude.  Yeah.  Well, I don't.  The customer comes first.  Yeah.  Yeah, you would be great.  I don't know who we could call.  XM has a deal with Starbucks.  We should get you a job somehow.  I really, yeah, I want to get hired.  I really do.  This place is only a block away from me.  Yeah, Patty wants to work. 
[01:05:30]  Patty definitely wants to work hard.  She doesn't want to just sit back and collect, you know, checks from the government.  She really wants to work.  And she would be a great employee.  What a gal.  Well, if you know anybody from Starbucks, tell them that.  Right.  Because I really would love to work there.  What happened to Godiva?  Did I miss something?  She got the boot.  Why'd you get the boot, Patty?  Well, because new manager equals little conflict, I guess.  I don't want to talk about those people.  You know, it's easy to do, you know, radio with Patty and just make fun of her. 
[01:06:00]  But I do care about this one.  Do you?  Yeah.  Oh.  She worked for Godiva for how long, Patty?  Five years almost.  She worked for five fucking years for Godiva.  Dedicated employee would show up early, would do whatever they said, you know.  That's right.  And clothes and stuff when nobody wanted to.  All right, shut up, Patty.  I'm trying to help you out.  I mean, it's so easy to term it.  Don't you understand that?  I'm on your side.  Thank you.  And then she would bring gifts in here, but she wasn't stealing the gifts. 
[01:06:30]  She would work up what?  We got our-  I used my employee discount.  Employee discount.  And then she'd like, every once in a while, for doing a good job, you would get a certain  amount of money that you could spend on chocolate, whatever.  And she would use that to bring us gifts.  She was a perfect employee.  Well, they get a new management team at the store she was at, I guess.  And they fired her.  For what?  For what, Patty?  Um, I don't know.  A lot of women managers can be that way.  But they got to give you a reason. 
[01:07:00]  Well, I'm going through my friend's lawyer now who's helping me, because they did the  write-up slip, and there were some lies on it and stuff.  What were they accusing you of?  Um, oh, God.  Um, I can't tell that on the air.  I really can't.  Yes, you can.  It'll help your case.  It's not the Enron scandal.  Yes, you can.  Yeah, really.  This is going to be a movie about it.  The lawyers are listening.  She talked about the big chocolate thing of 06.  Oh, no, she talked about the truffles. 
[01:07:30]  I know.  I really can't say that.  Shut up.  You can.  Shut up.  I have to keep that to myself between me and the lawyer.  I bet you she was putting chocolates in her panties and doing all kinds of dirty shit  and pretending to her birds and eating them.  Patty, you're not going to tell us?  I'm not allowed to.  All right.  You've just been bounced from the room.  There you go, stupid.  There you go, Patty.  There it is.  Bye-bye.  Stalker Patty, bounce.  Oh, wait a minute.  And now I'll put you on the ban list so you'll never get in unless you tell us what happened.  No, please. 
[01:08:00]  What happened?  All right.  I'll tell you.  What happened?  Or you get banned.  See?  Don't you understand?  Anthony has found a way to be God.  That's right.  He wins, you lose.  Right.  I'll tell you what happened.  All right.  What happened?  But I got to be very careful how I word it.  Just word it.  Go ahead.  Just dabble.  Okay.  There was one thing about me and a customer, but I didn't have anything to do with why they  went to another store to shop from.  Actually, you know, it was like a corporate account.  And what were the allegations made? 
[01:08:30]  Oh, that I was rude to her and stuff like that, and that's why they went to another place.  But it turned out there were two other ladies in the same office who just used the other  store and had nothing to do with the original client.  All right.  So there's a big corporate account comes in.  The account got lost, and they're blaming you for that loss of an account.  And she needed an excuse to let me go.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Okay, Patty, I pardon you. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, look at you.  You are now able to log.  You can now log back in.  What a bunch of shit dicks over at Godiva.  Wow, that really annoys me.  I'm not even kidding.  What Godiva was it?  The one, where was it?  Well, I don't see where I was.  Well, I'm asking you where it was.  What Godiva?  It's not a secret.  It was the one at the Time Warner building.  Yeah, Columbus.  And I actually walked in there once, and she worked really freaking hard.  She had pride in what she did.  You know, most of these people that work at stores like Godiva or Starbucks, they don't 
[01:09:30]  have pride in what they do.  She did.  Why don't we...  And it's easy to attack her and go after her.  We'll save that for another time.  This one really bothers me.  Let's try to get them on the phone, then.  Maybe they have a very accurate explanation, and they'd like to explain to the country,  Shut up, Patty.  I'm talking to my friends, Opie and Anthony, the millionaires.  Why don't we find out why they fired her?  Let's blow the case for her.  It's obvious what happened.  The new manager didn't like Patty for whatever reason.  I mean, she's a little strange.  We know that.  But she's a hard worker.  And so then at that point, what they do in the corporate world, they're like, you know, 
[01:10:00]  I don't want her around.  And then they figure out how to get rid of you and fire you.  You ever notice whenever we try to help Patty out, it usually ends in disaster.  So maybe we should just not call.  She'd probably wind up having to pay for the losses that the corporate account lost.  Yeah, she's going to have to hold a press conference.  I am distancing myself from Opie and Anthony through their irresponsible phone call.  I now owe $246,000 to Godiva. 
[01:10:30]  She's going to have to hold a press conference like Howard did.  I don't understand why they would do this to me.  I was a dedicated employee for five years.  And they figured me.  Sometimes they also bring their own people in, too, you know?  It's a lot like radio, Patty.  It sounds a lot like radio.  Do they give you severance?  No, I got absolutely nothing.  Yeah, they just kicked her out the door. 
[01:11:00]  I'm serious.  It's so easy just to beat her up.  But on this one, no fucking way.  Help you with fudge as you leave.  It's a throw to your head.  Patty, good news.  We just booked you on Letterman.  And all we need you to do is wear a T-shirt that says, I hate truffles.  I hate truffles?  No problem.  I could never leave them anyway.  When did they shit-can you?  I didn't even know this.  It was January 6th.  If I get to stop at Starbucks, that means I found a job in less than two months.  We understand what the month math is.  Yeah, months.  But if you don't get one until next month, it'll mean it took you almost three, right? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  And that would be bad.  Real bad.  I'm looking for a little bit more in the unemployment office when I go there for counseling and stuff.  How's your rent?  So far, so good.  I just owed this month's rent, and I paid a half of it already, so I'm fine with my rent.  I'm doing very well.  All right, Patty.  Oh, Anthony did want to ask you, what rooms are you hanging in?  What room?  Yeah, where do you go?  Aside from the Opie and Anthony room, Opie and Anthony Live. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, I go to the virus room a lot because it's smaller.  Yeah, but have you gone to the adult, some of the sex?  No, no.  I haven't explored those sites yet.  Patty, you can go there now and, in the comfort of your own home, see male junk without having to worry about it attacking you.  Why don't you go look at a penis?  I guess I'll try that tonight.  No.  Come on, tell me.  No, we want you to try it right now.  Try it right now, okay? 
[01:12:30]  I'm going to log on.  All right?  Log on.  All right, I'll try it right now, but that means I've got to close out of the room and stuff.  We understand what it takes.  And, Patty, turn your goddamn volume on your computer down.  I just about figured out how to turn it up.  I don't really know much about computers.  You could have stopped it.  I don't really know much.  That's right.  I do know one thing.  I am interested in a computer program up in 125th Street where they get computer courses for free. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, they do.  Oh, yeah.  They certainly do.  Because they want you to bring your own computer up there and let me hit you over the head with it and take it.  Yo, man.  Yeah, I teach a computer course.  They have classes with computers.  Yeah, yeah.  I wonder where they came from.  The last person that brought their computer to the lesson.  There's cranberry sauce on my keyboard.  It's so sticky.  It looks like ketchup. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, Patty, we're going to teach you cobalt.  Is that a 1980s concept?  Actually, it is, Patty.  Very good.  Now, Patty.  Patty.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Are you logged on?  Right now I am, yeah.  By the way, Patty, as Anthony gets you in one of these rooms, seriously, do not take a computer course.  No one takes computer courses anymore.  No.  They have made it very easy for you to just figure it out on your own. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, but I want to know how to do Quark and Photoshop and how to do all the little tricks with the computer and how to fix problems and stuff like that that you might have.  All right.  Then go up to 125th Street and risk your life to be able to freaking.  I've been up there before for different reasons and stuff, you know.  Patty.  You're logged on?  Yes, I am.  All right, do you know how to get to the list of rooms?  Get Patty's camera back on.  Oh, sure I do, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  All right, get the big list of rooms.  Okay, let me just close that on everything.  All right, Jesus Christ.  And then.  She's an old 486.  All right, now.  Monochrome monitor.  All right, now you got the rooms?  Let's go to browse video chat rooms.  What do you.  Adult contact on.  Patty.  Adult contact on.  Okay, browse video chat rooms.  Adult.  Adult, right.  Okay.

[01:15:00]  Are you in adult?  Oh, yes, I do.  I see playground.  All right, click on playground.  Okay, I just did.  All right.  All right.  Now, okay, Patty, you got to listen to me.  Yeah, preview some of the cameras.  Do you see porn, perverts, pervettes, flicks, and cams?  Yes, I do.  All right, get into that room.  All right.  All right.  Doing it.  All right, you're in there.  Now, now, click on Allen 99969. 
[01:15:30]  I missed it.  Okay.  Use video.  Oh, my God.  They're doing something.  Right.  That is a Negro having ass sex with a woman by a pool.  Oh, I get it.  No, no, don't get out.  Look at the size of that cock.  That's right.  Oh, you're fun. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  What's he doing?  See, Patty, this is the fun of Palto.  Oh, look, see?  Look, and that's something a black man doesn't normally do.  I bet those jokes are fake.  You see what he's doing there, Patty?  Yes, I do.  Now, wouldn't you like a guy to be doing that to you?  I don't know.  I have no idea what it's like.  You're a virgin.  You're a 50-year-old virgin.  Oh, my God.  Somebody said, hi, Patty.  Don't tell me they know I'm here. 
[01:16:30]  Yes, they do.  Why don't you rip your clothes off and cam up?  Cam up.  Cam up, Patty.  Cam up.  I'm just dealing with seeing it.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And somebody else said, hi, Ann.  The same person.  There they are.  All right, Patty.  Patty, go to Herbie Smoke-A-Lot.  All right.  I punch him up. 
[01:17:00]  And look at what he's doing.  All righty.  I bet you see your cat doing this to himself all the time.  Yeah, let me just.  Oh, wait.  What the heck?  See, look what he's doing now.  He's going to dig right in.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Patty, you have no idea how wonderful that is.  It's weird.  It really is.  Look, look.  There he goes.  Oh, my God.  That's got to hurt.  No, it doesn't hurt.  He's giving her a rim job.  Patty. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Explain to the rest of the country what you're watching right now.  Yeah.  Give us a blow-by-blow.  Somebody's butt and a guy taking his middle finger, which is the F finger, and going in  and out of her butt.  Now what's he doing?  He's just still doing it.  Yeah, but what's he doing with his face?  What is he fisting?  Is that what fisting is?  No, that's not fisting.  Shoot.  He's going to hurt her.  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:00]  That's not the part of baby comes out, you know?  Oh, Jesus.  It's I-hater.  Isn't she awful?  Oh, my God.  I hate her, too, Jimmy.  There's just something about her.  I hate you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  You get a good view.  You know, some other people followed me into this room.  Of course they did.  Because they're going to...  Oh, Patty, go back to Alan's camera now.  Yeah.  And look at what the black guy's doing.  Wow.  He is wrecking... 
[01:18:30]  Alan, okay.  Let me just...  Oh, Alan, here he is.  Right here.  Yeah.  Let me just close out of this month, Brock.  Here you go.  They're having...  It looks like a little conventional sex going on.  Yeah, but then he...  In the normal sense of the word.  You know, wait a minute.  They're posed the weird way.  It looks like just a butt and nothing else.  No, her legs are completely up in the air, Patty. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, they're up.  And her legs are together to make it feel like the cock is even bigger.  Is this...  That's not missionary.  No.  Patty, is this getting you hot at all?  Like, are you getting a feeling down there?  Like, when you see stuff like this?  Well, I don't know.  If I was alone and on my own, by myself, maybe.  But now I'm in the center of everything.  I'm not right under these circumstances.  No.  Well, now you know the rooms are there, so when you're alone, you could log in and look 
[01:19:30]  at some sex and maybe play with yourself.  Really?  Because I only go on in the morning for the show, like a couple mornings a weekend, just  at night.  In the middle of the day, I'm up and out.  We got the bob cam on that black guy.  He's giving her the jackhammer, though.  It's like, all I see is a bouncing butt and nothing else.  No, you don't see the ball bag?  Well, I see that, too.  But wait, there's two girls. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, it's called fucking Patty.  You see it?  Yeah, except, you know, as if what he's doing is not enough, you need them two to get in  there, too.  Well, yeah.  I thought it only took two to tango.  Tango.  And Joey's back is writing Patty, Patty, Patty.  I thought it took two to tango.  It only takes two to tango, but it takes three to lay down with a colored Patty.  He's got a lollipop there.  All right. 
[01:20:30]  Well, have fun in those rooms, too, Patty.  Don't just hang out in the O&A rooms.  It's about diversity and variety.  And go to the lesbo rooms.  Just go to all of the porno rooms and enjoy.  And wait till the black guy pulls his mule out.  There's going to be a good dive of chocolate on the helmet.  All right, Patty.  Okay.  Have fun.  There goes Stalker Patty, everyone.  A lot of people saying that Stalker Patty needs her own show.  Really?  Well, maybe we give her a couple hours on the weekend. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  We need some kind of theme for a Stalker Patty show, though.  We need someone to help her out, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Kvorkian.  Hey, Jimmy has gifts for us, Anthony.  Yeah.  What are the gifts, Jimmy?  Well, I forgot that the other day I thought of my...  Wow.  Those papers.  Oh, somebody.  God, I don't have his name, but sent me some newspapers from...  It's the Cleveland Plain Dealer.  It's from Wednesday, January 27th, 1943. 
[01:21:30]  It costs four cents.  Four cents.  Nice.  Good shape there, man.  It's all World War II stuff.  Uh, look at this.  Three hundred bombers raid Greece.  Nazis smash towards Kiev.  And, uh, I love the war stuff.  You know, I'm a big, uh, big fan.  But, uh, it's the little things in here.  Like the, um, the want ads.  Right.  And the, uh, the sales at the stores.  Some of the editorial stuff. 
[01:22:00]  Wanted Black Buck to carry water in from the bar.  Well, you're not very far off, Jimmy.  Well, Jimmy.  Because, uh, a wanted, uh, cook, a restaurant cook, uh, colored.  He wants a colored guy.  And you could just write that in the paper back then.  And this guy wants a cook.  And it says white.  He wants a white guy.  Uh, it's, it's amazing.  But, uh, but true.  You could actually pick the race that you wanted. 
[01:22:30]  In 1943.  In 1943.  You gotta see the cartoons, too.  Pittsburgh Press.  Oh, the cartoons have just some blatant racist black cartoons.  Uh, but it's, it's really funny.  Some of the, um, some of the, the editorial columns about how, uh, it was almost like affirmative action.  Like blacks wanted, uh, certain fire department jobs.  And this one guy talks about how discrimination is, uh, is not a good thing unless there's a reason for it.  He says he, like, preps this whole thing about, like, ah, discrimination isn't that good of a thing unless, of course, it's a good thing. 
[01:23:00]  A lot of ads for, um, cigarettes.  Okay.  Uh, one of which is done by a former Olympic skier who now trains the, uh, ski patrol for the Army.  And he's talking about how great it is to light up a Chesterfield because it's smooth on the throat.  And, uh, as he trains the troops, he likes smoking Chesterfield.  Imagine skiing, being an Olympic skier, and you're endorsing a cigarette only in 1942 and 43. 
[01:23:30]  That was 25 years before I was born.  It's very weird when you think of the world before.  You think it didn't exist before you showed up.  Yeah.  And it'll continue to exist long after we're gone.  Oh, long after.  Look at this.  See that?  Here's today's.  Yep.  Here's 1943.  Yep.  It's just a little yellower, but, uh, basically the same paper, the same format.  Someday this thing could be all yellow like this.  It could be this afternoon after it gets on Jimmy's bathroom floor. 
[01:24:00]  Or it could be from time.  That tends to yellow paper.  So.  Yeah, fantastic.  I gotta thank this guy.  Well, you gotta, you gotta thumb through it a little more.  Oh, yeah.  We gotta find some of those really strange cartoons we were looking at in the office.  Wonderful.  Yes.  Uh, but Jimmy has gifts for us.  I have gifts.  Yeah, gifts.  I want to get presents.  I want presents.  Well, I went, uh, it was last week.  My buddy, uh, Chris and my other buddy, uh, John, um, from PC Richard, actually. 
[01:24:30]  They was at a boxing event.  Um, that had nothing to do with them.  They're just friends and they, um, said, yeah, we'll get you.  It was like a cigar event where Jake LaMotta was gonna be appearing.  So I went.  Jake LaMotta.  Because I wanted a picture with him.  How old is Jake now?  He's gotta be in his 80s.  Wow.  He's really kind of out of it.  But again, it should be dead.  I mean, you know, if you look at the age of...  Jake was fighting when these papers were out.  Do you understand, LaMotta, when this paper was popular... 
[01:25:00]  It was the sports section.  He's probably in it.  It was a boxing section.  Oh, my God.  Give me the sports section.  That's the section I want to check out.  All right.  Because LaMotta fought in the 40s.  I mean, I don't know if it was 43 or 47.  It might be a couple years before, but he was boxing when this happened, whether it  was in the gym as a young guy training.  Jeez, how big do these fucking papers have to be?  I know.  Where's the TV ad for T-Bone shit?  Yeah.  There's no ads for anything, like, cool.  You know how bad singles ads were back then?  There was no sexual implications.  Well...  Looking for somebody who likes a flower on their hat. 
[01:25:30]  In the real estate section, you could get a house on the water for $5,000 or something  like that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but the dollar was different, right?  A little bit.  Really?  How much?  Grocery man.  Established city route.  Pittsburgh.  White or colored.  That's nice.  I like it.  Guys really looking...  Female help wanted and male help wanted in separate sections. 
[01:26:00]  People bitch about now, how shit is now.  Just stop.  Oh, boy.  Here's the sports section.  Look at this guy kicking.  What's he kicking?  Football, obviously.  He's got that leather football helmet on.  Ken Strong was a runaway buffalo with the speed of an antelope.  They were talking about a baseball contract that was for $5,200 a year for Major League Baseball.  They traded some guy from the Boston Braves to the New York Yankees for $5,000. 
[01:26:30]  And they didn't say trade.  It was bought and sold.  They were buying and selling people.  Here's a lovely little comic called Cracking the Whip.  And it's this black mammy peeking out the door going, get Moe off of the end there.  And it's a bunch of young Negro children holding hands. 
[01:27:00]  And it's Eenie, Meenie, Miney, and Moe and Susie.  Could you imagine this in the paper these days?  It's your stereotypical cartoon black people.  Get Moe off the end there.  I don't know what it means.  It must have meant something back in 1943.  Joe Palooka?  Joe Palooka's in there, Jimmy.  Joe Palooka.  I'm looking for the houses for sale. 
[01:27:30]  A lot of dressmaking.  Can I have one of those papers?  Rosie the Riveter.  I want to read a paper.  You get Roosevelt and Churchill meet in Africa to map out victory.  I remember when this happened.  Hey, look at this.  Casablanca with Bogart and Bergman is up among best melodrama of the year.  Oh, look at that.  Hey.  It's the movie section.  Extra added.  Let's see.  At the Palace.  This is not just the movies.  Live performance. 
[01:28:00]  On stage, in person.  Louis Armstrong and his orchestra.  Extra added.  Step and Fetch It.  Laziest man in the world.  Dude.  Step and Fetch It.  Here's how it's built.  Laziest man in the world.  That's a black guy.  Gotta love it.  The good old days.  Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth.  You were never lovelier.  That's playing tonight at the Allen Theater.  And then, what do they got?  Jap food? 
[01:28:30]  Jesus, this is crazy.  And Chinese food?  And I wouldn't go to a Jap restaurant back then.  It's the enemy.  Keep an eye on them while you eat.  I can't wait.  I guarantee there's a post going on right now.  Good radio, guys.  Reading the paper.  Reading the paper.  Yes.  We can read the paper on the radio.  It's fascinating, though.  Yeah.  Get one yourself.  It's the Cleveland Plain Dealer.  Play along at home.  From 1943.  Boy, look at the science. 
[01:29:00]  Look at this.  This is a one-page ad.  These were big papers, too.  They were huge.  Like, they were twice the size almost of the post, each page.  Science reveals cold sufferers need extra B-complex vitamins.  That's an entire one-page ad.  Wow.  That was important news.  They died when they were 22 back then.  Lil' Abner.  I hate Lil' Abner.  All right.  Lil' Abner stinks.  Well, maybe we'll look at the paper during the break to get the good stuff.  A lot of clothing ads, too.  Sure.  See, they still, back then, with the fucking ads, like they do now, 
[01:29:30]  you can't get through a goddamn newspaper without a thousand ads.  Jimmy, I've got to take a leak, so could we do the gift thing after the break?  I think that that's a good tease.  Hey, here's how you set the tease up.  I'm getting good with radio.  Hey, the gifts will be coming soon.  What are they going to be?  I want my gift.  No.  I don't like that.  That was a tease.  People are on the edge of their seats.  Maybe use the word unwrapping.  What?  Because it's a gift, and we'll be unwrapping it.  But it's not wrapped. 
[01:30:00]  I can't.  Why?  How about this?  Um, pretty soon we'll be in the presence of presents.  That's good.  I'm coming down to the ATL.  That's right.  Hotlanta.  Jim Norton heading down to the Punchline Comedy Club.  March 16-18.  That's this Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Box office number is 404-252-LAFF, L-A-F-F. 
[01:30:30]  That's 404-252-L-A-F-F.  March 16-18.  Thanks, Steve.  What's this note say?  Atlanta has n-  Yes, it does.  And I'd appreciate it if none of them came to my show.  What the hell is wrong with you, Jimmy? 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  I didn't read it.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  And Jimmy's got gifts.  Yeah, that's what we hear.  And I have to, before the big gift thing that I've been making everybody wait for hours.  Yes.  Elo I just talked to.  And I love, this is why I love Logan.  He like knows I was bitching.  Because I wanted a little portable unit because I was screaming about them.  They're wonderful.  The Helix. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  I've been using mine like crazy.  It's unbelievable how small this thing is.  Yeah.  You guys are going to love this when it hits the market.  Very tiny.  I've heard.  I'll go get one, too.  So I was just talking to Elo, and he said we're trying to piece together one for you.  Yeah.  Like, he's going to send me one, but he's trying to get a charger.  It's like, I don't want a demo one.  It's not to be a prima donna.  I'd rather buy it because I don't want people's hands were on it.  You just want to open up a nice package.  Brand new.  They're in such limited supply.  Yeah, I'll just go. 
[01:32:00]  They really don't have many down there in Washington.  I don't even think they have any others.  Later on.  Well, if they did, he would have had access to it.  Well, they have one, but they have to find the charger and find the earbuds.  I don't want.  I'm not.  I won't use Junet.  I'll buy it.  I'll go to the store and buy it.  I'm going to buy another one anyway.  It's that damn good.  Yeah.  So what do you got, Jimmy?  Jake LaMotta, right?  Yes.  Now I'm annoyed again.  No.  Don't be annoyed.  Look, you're wearing your Black Sabbath t-shirt.  Remember yesterday?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Two days ago.  Oh.  Hey, you know what?  Used is better than not at all.  Wait, you take lemons, take lemonade.  I don't even want to sing.  I just want to dance and enjoy the music.  No reason to send me anything.  I mean, I get paid the same as the guys, right?  Motherfuckers down in D.C.?  How about helping a brother out?  You know what, though?  They do help me out in plenty of ways.  If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have any place to go every day.  I wouldn't have a fan base.  You know what I mean?  I'm really happy that they do allow me to come on here and talk shit about their products every day.  And I can talk as much shit as I want, but I'm not going to get anything sent. 
[01:33:00]  Maybe I can stand in line at Best Buy like the fucking rest of the schlubs out there who talk about it day in and day out.  And rave about it because the products are good.  They're all so well-built and well-constructed.  And that's why this company is beating the dog shit out of serious.  There's no way to compete because technologically we're really advanced.  However, I think they treat their employees just a little bit better.  I think they give their employees a lot of shit.  I'll bet you Howard's people aren't sitting around waiting for shit.  I'll bet you Martha Stewart's people aren't sitting around waiting for shit.  But that's because they work there.  Jeremy Coleman probably traipses it and just hands shit over to people. 
[01:33:30]  Then again, if Jeremy Coleman walked in right now, I'm trying to think of something happy to say.  Even though I'm snapping and dancing, I'm still thinking about the reality of the whole thing.  But I'll just keep being happy because you can't be sad when this song plays.  I have gifts to give.  I don't even know I get.  I want gifts.  Let's get to the gift giving.  I don't want to explain that to the new listeners.  All right, we will really fast.  That's Jimmy's camo music that calms him down when he gets a little out of hand on the program.  So I went to meet LaMotta because my friends got me in. 
[01:34:00]  And I walk in.  It was amazing.  I walked up and Jerry Cooney is standing out there.  It was his event.  And everyone is so nice.  So I get a picture with Cooney.  And I walk in and I'm like, where's Jake?  And I find Jake.  They show me where Jake is.  He's ancient.  I mean, he's got to be in his 80s.  He has a black cowboy hat on.  So I brought a copy of Raging Bull for him to sign.  Yeah.  I didn't have anything for Jake to sign.  So I get my picture with him.  And then I look over and I see Larry Holmes. 
[01:34:30]  Wait, you got a copy of Raging Bull signed by LaMotta?  I brought it with me.  I thought of it as, as, as, what a, what a, wow.  And someone else goes, dude, I wish I would have thought of that.  That is a great one.  I didn't even think of it until I was leaving the house.  I'm like, you got to get something to sign.  I thought of pictures.  And then I'm walking around and I see all these people with boxing gloves.  And then I realized they were selling boxing gloves there for 50 bucks.  So I bought one.  I had Holmes sign it, Cooney, LaMotta.  There was a couple other guys there, old, real boxing fans, something, Emil something, 
[01:35:00]  old black guy, and some other guy, fuck whose name, I can't remember.  But they were obviously popular guys way back in the day.  And then I thought of my buddies.  I said, what am I doing?  I'm being very selfish.  I have two friends who I would love to.  Oh, no.  He's going to make us feel guilty.  Oh, Jesus.  Because I can't remember the last time I bought Jimmy Norton anything.  I'm thinking of shit.  Well, I thought of my pals.  I said.  We think about you too, Jimmy.  I know.  I know you do.  I'm sure you hear me on the replay on your brand new units. 
[01:35:30]  I decided.  I said, I'm going to get.  I'm like, how selfish.  I was.  I didn't know they were selling boxing gloves.  Yeah.  So I go back over and I said, give me two gloves.  I want to buy two boxing gloves and take them around and get them signed from my friends.  However, there's an odd dilemma I had.  There's two gloves left when I get there.  Oh.  I have one and I see the other one on the counter.  So I say to the guy, well, the guy, because the guy says to me, there's only one glove left. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, no.  And I'm like, no, there's one right there.  And so he says to the other guy working there, well, is that ours?  And the guy goes, no, no, no, I got it.  Like the other salesman.  And the guy he was selling it to says to me, you need two, huh?  And I'm like, yeah.  And he goes, dude, I'm sorry.  I just, I got to get this signed from my kid, which means I've paid for this first or tough shit for you.  So I'm like, all right.  So now I have one glove and two people.  You're not going to make us fight for it, are you?  No.  We don't have to go into an octagon. 
[01:36:30]  What do we do?  So.  A man's man.  They didn't have.  I'm more of a man's man than you are, Anthony.  I think right about now I could kick your ass.  I say a little man to man comparing straightens this whole thing out.  And no filling up.  That's cheating.  Look at those ribs.  So I had to buy one glove and then I had to buy another gift, which wasn't as good as a glove. 
[01:37:00]  As good as a glove.  Because the glove is like, you know, it's a boxing glove.  It's a bunch of famous boxers.  Yes.  Sure.  So they had T-shirts and they had hats.  Good Lord.  What are you doing, sweetie?  Glove or T-shirts or a hat.  My famous loser sound effects doesn't play anymore.  Well.  I don't know why.  Fix that, Hawk, before you get your teeth knocked out.  All right.  Anyway, go ahead, Jimmy.  So I had to buy one glove and the other gift wasn't a glove, but it wasn't that I didn't 
[01:37:30]  want to spend the money on the other guy.  Of course.  Well, Anthony has no problem with the T-shirt.  He's not really a boxing fan, so don't worry about it.  Well, I didn't get a T-shirt.  I bought a hat.  Oh, no.  Because the hat was easier to get signed because the brim of the hat was easier for these guys  to sign.  It's an easier one to display as well.  Anthony's cool with the hat, I'm sure.  Here it is.  Here's how I feel about the whole thing.  I'll just show you the glove. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, wow.  Look at that glove.  His name is, I'm sorry, Emil, some other boxing fans, an older black guy.  Let's see what we got.  Larry Holmes, Jerry Cooney, Jake LaMotta.  Jake LaMotta and silver.  And silver.  Wow.  I bothered him while he was eating for this one.  I went back over to all these guys to get them for you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That looks like it's easier to sign than a baseball, by the way.  That would go great in my sports collectible room. 
[01:38:30]  You don't have a sports collectible room?  Of course I do.  You don't?  What do you have in your sports collectible room?  Oh, so much stuff.  I can barely even keep track of it.  Lots of stuff.  Lots of sports memorabilia that's signed.  What do you have, Ed?  I have a, I have Wayne Gretzky's stick.  And it's signed.  I have one of those.  I do.  I have a Derek Jeter signed jersey. 
[01:39:00]  I know you do.  Or something like that.  You do not.  I have a.  What is wrong with you?  No, no.  Okay.  I don't have that.  I don't have the stick either.  I have a boxing glove that is signed, or I will anyway.  No.  When I build my sports collectible room.  Jimmy, who do you think should have the boxing glove?  Don't you?  I love the way Jake signed this one.  And mine doesn't even have this.  He signed this in silver.  Because that was just the one I had. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  So it stands out.  I wish I knew this guy Ernie's name.  I don't remember.  Emil.  I'm sorry.  Emil.  Because everybody else knew who he was.  If you're a big boxing fan from the old days, you know who he was.  And, um.  Just hand it over to who you think should have it.  Oh, this is.  No, I.  No, no.  Not that the other gift isn't good.  Let's see the other gift.  No, the other gift is nice.  Let's see the other one.  Let's see the other gift.  Oh, my God.  It's the cheapest hat I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, my God.  That's like a hat an old guy would wear, man. 
[01:40:00]  Holy crap.  It's not.  It's.  It's.  Oh, my God.  It's the worst hat.  It's got Jake LaMotta.  Dude, no offense, but that is the worst hat.  Oh, it's not a great hat.  That is a hat you see in a retirement community in Florida.  However, this hat, it was either this or a t-shirt, and the hats were better than the  shirts, and I figured the hats are easier to display.  But what are you going to do with a t-shirt, a signed t-shirt, and you get folded?  At least a hat.  How do you display a hat?  That hat is losing t-cells as we speak. 
[01:40:30]  How do you display a hat?  Yeah.  Is you can at least put it up on something like that.  You can hang it.  A hat is not that hard to display.  Only Jimmy can get gifts and now make me feel bad because I don't want to be an ass.  And you want to hear the irony of what really sucks is the older guy who was trying to help  me out.  And he did.  The guy was looking for another glove for me because I really, it would have been just  easier.  Well, of course it would.  He actually went outside to another area to see if they had gloves.  He actually checked in two locations for me, and they didn't have another one. 
[01:41:00]  I see him an hour later, and he goes, you know, after you walked away, we found another  glove.  And I'm like, let me have it.  He goes, oh, we sold it.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, thanks for letting me know.  It was, uh...  Hey, by the way, we got some info on the Amelia guy.  Emile, yeah.  Emile?  All right.  Pete in Richmond.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Pete.  Yeah, I figured this might make you guys want that glove a little bit more.  Emile Griffith is real famous.  In, like, the 60s, he was gay, and he was a really sick officer.  That's him. 
[01:41:30]  He killed the guy in the ring.  That's him.  That's him.  That is absolutely him.  He's famous for, um...  Basically, the guy called him gay in the ring, and he just fucking went crazy.  And there's a real famous...  It's like a timeline photograph of the dude he killed right after he killed him just hanging  in the corner, dead.  Wow.  Yes, and I know that story's absolutely true.  And he actually did not sign the hat.  He signed the glove.  Oh, my God.  That hat doesn't even have that guy's signature.  Who's the other guy?  Who's another guy?  Who's another guy?  Torres or something like that? 
[01:42:00]  An older guy?  I don't know.  I just figured I'd call him crazy.  I remember Torres.  No, this is...  Dude, this is...  So, Carlos something...  Is there an old fire named Carlos something?  Like a middleweight?  My buddy John would know.  I'm so annoyed.  Because he signed my glove.  I didn't get...  He wasn't on this.  Again, I had to go back and do all this.  Yeah.  And Emil, my friend Chris Patrick got while he was eating.  Emil just...  He handled...  I got Jake while he was eating.  They signed this faggot?  Yeah.  Well, John told me this story about it.  He goes...  This guy...  He goes...  He said there's a story with this guy. 
[01:42:30]  He's gay.  And he killed a guy in the...  That's the guy.  Wow.  I want to see that picture now.  The guy just dead in the...  I would love to see that.  ...in the corner.  If someone has it, send it in.  Wow.  We'll throw it up on the website.  So, who did sign the...  The really...  The hat is signed by...  It's actually...  I mean...  The nice hat?  Who signed the nice...  Oh, Anthony likes the hat.  So now you have no decision to make here.  No, I'll tell you something.  I like the boxing glove, of course, because that is the top of the line and stuff.  But this, Opie, contrary to your beliefs, this isn't about the value of it or anything. 
[01:43:00]  This is just Jimmy thinking about us on a night out.  That's right.  And I would be honored to accept whatever you would give me in that vein.  Because the glove would look good.  I have to get myself the glove with a case.  Because gloves have a nice case.  You display them in.  Yes.  Yeah, I got one.  And I myself...  I got a case that's empty right now.  Yeah, it's an empty case and it's...  Though I would be happy with the glove more than the hat, I am not so shallow that I could 
[01:43:30]  not just accept a gift from you.  How about this?  I'm trying the Star Trek strategy where there's two Kirk's and then the one Kirk goes,  shoot him!  He's the other Kirk.  And then the other Kirk goes, Spock, shoot me.  I got this.  Just to make sure.  Shoot us both.  One of the listeners got...  It's not working.  He has the idea.  Abbott in New York.  Uh, what's up?  Hey, I think you guys should do a contest for that glove.  And what's the contest? 
[01:44:00]  Uh, Ben, I don't know.  I just thought that you guys should do a contest.  I have an idea.  Um, and I'll be the judge.  It's whoever gets down farther without gagging.  Let's go to Pat in Boston.  Pat actually does have an idea.  Pat?  And you can put this right on good old PeterBullet.com.  I'd say a little fan poll.  What the listeners decide?  Oh.  I know I will lose.  It will be a landslide victory for Anthony.  No, because now that you said that.  But I am willing to do that.  Now that you said that, it's going to go the other way. 
[01:44:30]  I am willing to do that.  Take pictures of the two items.  Hawk did.  Hawk's on top of it.  Can you do a poll on EatABullet.com so you get some action?  Well, I'm actually in the process of updating that site, right?  I probably have 60 new pictures to put up there.  So why don't we do it on OpenAnthony.com or Foundry?  Because it's just more, it's more.  OpenAnthony.com.  Or Foundry.  Yeah, one of those.  It's better for the poll.  Get some pictures of the great gifts Jimmy got us.  And then let the listeners decide who gets what.  I would love to have had it on EatABullet, but it's not ready.  I'll tell you who's signed the hat.  It's got, I mean the hat is still, it's got. 
[01:45:00]  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  It has Chris Patrick, my friend.  It's got Jerry Cooney, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta.  Wow.  I mean, they were the three big.  Larry Holmes is weird, too, because I shook his head.  He never does appearances, either.  I couldn't fucking believe he was sitting there.  I mean, they must have paid him a lot of money.  Larry Holmes does not come out.  And he.  Oh, that's the dead guy.  Wow, let me see that.  Wow.  That's the dead guy?  Wow, man.  Did he beat him up?  Holy crap. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  Okay, guys, a man's man.  Yeah.  Can I see the glove at least?  At least he didn't fuck him to death.  I would let you see the glove, but I have to be careful, because if Opie wins the glove,  he may not have wanted you to handle it.  And that, I have to.  I have to.  Can you hold it up?  I have to think.  Sure, I can display it.  You are a twisted.  Fuck.  I bet you there were two gloves, Anthony, and he's enjoying this.  I think he enjoyed just getting one glove. 
[01:46:00]  There really was one glove.  I would love to have avoided having this happen.  All right, get the gifts up on openanthony.com and let the listeners decide.  I hated having two different gifts.  Do you know how much easier it would have been to traipse him with two gloves and go,  here for you, here for you?  How many times, like, grandma would come over with two gifts for the brothers or something,  and one is really good because grandma doesn't know anything, and one turns out to be good,  and one's like crap?  Look, I, you know, although I'm not saying it's crap, Jimmy.  Yeah, it's nice.  That, without the glove, that's a major, major gift. 
[01:46:30]  I just didn't want to get the t-shirt because I figured the t-shirt's too hard to sign,  and this is a hard brim.  These are older guys, especially LaMotta.  If you're going to sign a t-shirt, it would just be a scratch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well, is the pole up there yet?  Hey, could you do a jumping jack?  Oh, my God.  Please?  He's the one with the short arms.  All right, cool.  That was nice.  Thumb in each ear.  That was good.  He almost got him over his head.  Thumb in each ear.  It was close enough, Jimmy.  He did a jumping juke.  All right, let us know when the pole is up. 
[01:47:00]  Are you willing to do a pole?  Yeah, that seems to be a fair way to do it.  It is the only fair way.  The listeners decide.  I really was annoyed that there wasn't a second glove.  It would have been a lot easier.  You were annoyed.  Yeah, well.  At least I got the hat, though.  I mean, there was nothing else.  I tried to buy the fact the hat was a lot cheaper.  It did make it a little more palatable.  Yeah.  But I mean, I figured whoever...  I didn't know who to do what with, so I'm like, whoever the fans say gets the glove,  I mean, you're the one I'm going to sell it to. 
[01:47:30]  I personally think you should bring the other glove in, and you take the hat.  I'm glad you think that.  That's an interesting thought.  The only reason I wouldn't do that, no, nothing to do with being selfish, is the fact that  the other glove not only has Emile's signature on it, it has that guy, I want to say Carlos  Torres.  Jose Torres?  Let me see it.  Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  What's up, man?  Hey, Jimmy.  I think you were reaching for Jose Torres before.  He's a small guy, probably a middleweight.  He's fought in the 50s or 60s or whatever? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, he's a little bit older.  He was trained by Customato, who trained Mike Tyson.  I'm pretty sure he was the first boxer to win championship in multiple weight classes.  Yeah, that might be the guy, too.  This guy was like an ex-champion, and I also got him on my glove, and I also got Mitch Blood  Green, who showed up last minute.  So I would be happy to give that one away, but I figure that the gloves should have equal  signatures on it.  Not that I kept the best one for myself, of course.  I will pass, and I will give the glove to Anthony. 
[01:48:30]  No, you can't do that.  I think you would really enjoy the glove.  Then I'll feel guilty.  Well, who's...  Now I got a guilt thing.  Who's honestly...  No, no, no.  Who's honestly...  Because neither one of you...  There was a hundred of these going around that night.  I saw guys with gloves, and I thought, what a brilliant idea.  I should have brought one.  I just didn't think that boxers signed gloves, because a lot of ballplayers won't sign  a baseball for eBay purposes.  Anthony, take the glove.  I'm sure I can figure out some way to display that hat. 
[01:49:00]  We have to get you away.  Whoever takes what.  I don't care who gets what.  I mean, whichever one would get more out of it.  I want...  Who's the bigger boxing fan?  I mean, it's...  You know...  Well, I think as far as boxing goes, we're probably...  No, it comes down to the Jake LaMotta...  ...equal fans, but the Jake LaMotta thing is huge.  Yeah, that's...  And, I mean, you know, even the rest of the boxers on there, at some point in there...  See, Jerry Cooney's from our hometown, so, I mean...  Yeah.  That's an easy one to get for us if we really wanted it. 
[01:49:30]  I've seen him a million times.  Actually, he gave me his card, because he found out I was a comedian, so...  I imagine Cooney, if he was there promoting something, he may even be willing to come  on the show.  That's just a guess.  Yeah.  Because he does a charity event.  He helps out a lot of old fighters.  Yeah, he does.  That's what it's called.  That's what the whole organization is.  It's about helping...  Yeah.  You know whose son was there, too?  Mills Lane?  Do you know who I should have got a shot with if he was there?  Maybe, again, whoever called in could help out.  Or one of you guys...  Al Mackey, I think his name is.  He's like...  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  Do you know who he is, or no?  No.  Thank God.  Because I was really ready to kill myself.  He's in all day city.  He reffed more fights than anybody. 
[01:50:00]  I think he's the old guy.  Jake LaMotta!  That old box...  Really?  I think he's the guy who was walking in Raging Bull when LaMotta was winning the championship.  There's a little old referee walking across the ring in slow motion, moving his arms  in and out like, that's it?  Yeah.  And he has a little tough...  It's one of the best shots ever taken in a film.  I think that was Al Mackey.  I didn't realize it until after.  All right.  We'll throw the gifs up on opianthony.com and let the listeners fight at ours decide.  My Raging Bull's a good one, too.  I wish I would have thought.  I would have just brought more copies of that. 
[01:50:30]  That would have been really cool.  I got Raging Bull signed by Jake.  And I got the inside signed.  That's perfect.  You know what?  Maybe I could take my Raging Bull...  Because I already know I'm going to lose this.  I'm going to take my Raging Bull DVD and wrap the hat around it.  How about...  Or I'm...  Is there...  Wait a minute now.  And I was being serious.  I don't know how to display that fucking thing.  Chris...  Well, the hat I just felt would be easier than the thing. 
[01:51:00]  I didn't want you to have to put it up, hang it up like it's a hockey jersey.  I...  I know I'm a glutton for punishment.  This is not going to be fair.  No, see?  Because you're saying this now.  I'm campaigning.  Here's what...  You're campaigning.  And people are going to...  I can see it going one of two ways.  People could see that people would expect Ope thinks Ant's going to win.  Right.  People would vote for Ope because he's Ope.  And then people would vote for Ant because of the Raging Bull angle.  I mean...  What needs to be acknowledged here?  Jimmy's really into this.  No, but believe it or not, I'm not...  Why would you make such conflict? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  But believe it or not, I'm not into it.  Because for me, it would be easier to give my two pals...  Alright, when's the poll up?  I want some poll results before the end of the show.  A gift and receive the glory of having given a gift.  Alright.  Right.  And receive the love from my pals.  To have to give one a gift is not a comfortable thing.  But now...  I'm not a sadist.  Alright.  Or a masochist because I know whoever gets the hat, there's going to be fucking problems.  Hey, good morning, Jim.  Yeah.  Hey, go fuck yourself.  Hence, I shouldn't get the hat. 
[01:52:00]  You shouldn't even get the glove because regardless, it's not going to matter tomorrow morning.  I want to...  You're not an asshole.  What an asshole.  But no, I want to...  I wish they could...  You're more evil than I.  Chris or John would know if he's given me another one of these events.  I'm sure there will be.  Yeah, alright.  Jake does some signings for PC.  Yeah.  Alright, they're working on getting the poll up.  We're going to take a quick break.  We got Mark Spitz outside the studio who used to write for Spin Magazine, right?  He doesn't write for Spin anymore.  Thumbs down on Spin Magazine.  Something happened with Spin Magazine, but he knows the music industry and we're going 
[01:52:30]  to get into some things with him in just a bit.  Alright, we got lots going on with the program.  Don't forget this Friday we're broadcasting live from the Hard Rock Cafe, our St. Paddy's  Day broadcast.  It's going to be a lot of fun. 
[01:53:00]  We're doing it from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. East Coast time.  Oh, yeah.  And then we might replay it if it's a good show.  If it's an awful live show, then we won't replay it.  Right?  I think it's going to be a good show, though.  We got lots going on.  Yeah.  We're going to be doing some karaoke.  Starker Paddy's going to sing White Rabbit.  Master Poe, we learned, has a really good singing voice and loves to sing love songs.  Love songs.  We'll get Big A up there to stammer his way through a tune.  We got Twitchell showing up.  We got the Hogan family showing up. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, really?  Hulk Hogan and the gang will be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  I'm really in the right corner.  I'm going to miss that.  I would love to meet Hulk Hogan.  And Dr. Ian Smith from Celebrity Fit Club, I hear, is coming by with maybe a special guest.  Jimmy Norton?  Maybe.  I like guests.  Paddy, Jimmy?  It's not definite, so we don't want to announce it yet, but we're working on some other things.  It should be a really, really good time, though.  I think we're going to have a lot of fun there.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  And before, as our guest is coming in, can I just mention tonight, because it's for, 
[01:54:00]  it's Kenny's son has like an athletic league he belongs to.  Right.  That's why we're doing a benefit tonight, the Stress Factory, for that youth athletic league.  It's a good cause.  It's myself, Jim Florentine, Chuck Manganielli, and Don Jameson for Meet the Creeps.  732-545-HA-HA is Vinny's repulsive phone number for that.  Ha-HA.  That fucking, he should be beaten with a rock for that.  But tonight only at the Stress Factory.  Yeah, it's for a great cause.  Ben is also telling me Patrice O'Neill will be at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Bill Burr will be at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[01:54:30]  Rich Voss will be there.  Jesus.  Wow.  Damien Fahey from TRL on MTV.  Star-studded event.  And also Laszlo will be making an appearance, so it's going to be a lot of fun.  Yes.  We don't even really have to promote this.  It's going to be just a zoo this Friday.  I wish I was going to be there.  All the girls will show up with their vagges.  Yeah, we get more girls that show up at these things than the old days.  Yeah, it's because people think I'm going to be there and the girls love me.  So that's a good thing because we used to have to do live broadcasts and parties in front  of a thousand dudes and maybe like three slutty girls. 
[01:55:00]  And now it's getting to the point where girls feel comfortable.  They can hang out in the Opie and Anthony atmosphere there.  Right.  So very good.  We'll see you guys at the Hard Rock Cafe this Friday at 11 a.m.  Let's get Mark Spitz in here.  He used to write for Spin Magazine.  Cool.  And he's got a book out, I guess.  There he is.  What's up, Mark?  Hey.  I am so glad the first thing you did was take off the sunglasses. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  No, it's early.  You know, so I had them on.  I didn't want to be.  We're like, oh, no.  This guy's just hanging out outside the studio with his Ray-Bans on.  Ray-Bans, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I will make eye contact.  All right, good.  And then I'm like, man, it's not that bright in here.  And he did the right thing, and he took them off, and I appreciate that.  We thought we might be dealing with a hipster.  Well, yeah, you are, but, you know, without the sunglasses.  Yeah, without the sunglasses.  I get called a hipster.  I'm not any hip, any more or less hip than anyone else. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I just like to dress the part a little bit, right?  I get prejudiced against.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You used to write for Spin Magazine?  Up until two weeks ago.  Yeah.  I got fired.  That's a cool gig to have.  It was great.  Eight years.  Eight years, and then you just got fired?  They fired me the day my novel came out.  Uh-oh.  Like, literally the day it was in stores.  Why?  Maybe they were threatened by it, because it was so good.  A lot of inside information in the novel or something?  No.  No, I didn't name any names or anything. 
[01:56:30]  I think it was just coincidence, but it was just weird, you know, because I was really excited.  The book's coming out.  You know, it's like a year and plus building up to the release, like a record or a movie  or anything.  Right, right.  And then I get this call.  I'm taking my laundry out of the dryer in my apartment, and they're like, we need you  to come in.  I'm like, look, I know that the magazine's been sold, and I know what you're...  Like, just tell me.  I'm fired.  You know?  And they're like, yes, your job's been eliminated.  Eliminated.  Why?  Because they had a different management come in.  They sold the magazine.  There's a new editor-in-chief and, I guess, a new vision, and I don't fit with that vision. 
[01:57:00]  That's always what happens.  I'm too hip.  Again, too hip.  Will you be able to get another gig, easily?  Another gig?  This is my, you know, I'm promoting the book.  And now he's a writer.  He's got an obelow.  Yep.  What kind of stories did he write for Spin Magazine?  Anything we would know?  I wrote 14 cover stories since I was there, since 98.  I wrote about the Strokes twice.  I wrote about the Killers twice.  I wrote about Morrissey.  My first cover was Axl Rose in 99. 
[01:57:30]  Did you...  So you interviewed him?  No.  I interviewed everyone else.  I interviewed everyone, like, affiliated with him, except Izzy, who's disappeared, and Axl.  Although Axl did call Spin, or my editor then, Alan Light, in, like, the middle of the night,  to kind of rant and rave and maybe commit to an interview, and then he backed off.  But, like...  Well, that doesn't sound like Axl.  That's strange.  What the fuck is wrong with him?  Like, he doesn't show up for gigs?  It's like, what's the...  What's he got?  Like, one of the...  Agoraphobia? 
[01:58:00]  What's the problem with this guy?  I don't...  This is before he showed up at the MTV thing.  This is, like, 99.  Before anyone knew about the cornrows and the...  Yeah, whatever's going on there.  They're thinking plastic surgery.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I saw the show at the Garden, like, I guess the last ever show, and they were great.  They sounded great, but it's just, they...  I don't get the look, you know?  Yeah, it's a little weird.  Oh, you mean when they got back together?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What, with the other guys, with Buckethead and all that?  Buckethead and...  But I just don't...  I don't get the football jersey and the kind of Predator hair.  I just...  It breaks my heart a little bit. 
[01:58:30]  Why the cornrows?  The jersey, at least, he wore in the...  What was the video?  Oh, my God.  Paradise City?  Paradise City, yeah.  Was it Paradise City?  The Mean Machine jersey, yeah.  So, he used to wear it back in the days, but...  It's just kind of weird.  He's kind of turned into a douche, so this guy was one of the best.  Well, he was always a douche, though.  Was he?  I remember, I saw Guns N' Roses, and who the hell opened up for him?  It was, uh...  Oh, my God.  Great memories we all got on here. 
[01:59:00]  No, what?  For Skid Row, Jesus.  And there was another band in Toronto at one of these, you know, open-air stadiums.  It was like 100,000 people there.  And Axl Rose made everyone wait for like an hour and a half.  It's like, what are you doing?  He was always a douche, Jimmy.  His music was great.  I was a huge Guns N' Roses fan, but he was always just a dick.  Yeah, he really did have no respect or regard for the fans at all.  He didn't give a shit.  In 90 minutes, he'd make you sit there and wait over three hours sometimes.  Well, the famous story with Metallica, with James Hetfield.  Oh, with that riot. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, burning himself.  And they basically went to Axl Rose, and Guns N' Roses said, look, you have to, you know,  pick it up here, because Metallica played a shortened set, because James Hetfield burned  himself on stage.  And Axl and Guns N' Roses were like, yeah, whatever.  And they played a short set, and that's what caused the riot, because people felt like they  were gypped at that point.  And instead of going right on stage, because Metallica had to cut their set short, made  the fans wait, what, a couple hours or something crazy like that?  And then did a shortened set, and that's when the riot occurred. 
[02:00:00]  That crazy riot that is just classic now.  And they've contributed nothing on the level that Metallica has anyway.  I mean, Guns N' Roses was great, but fucking Metallica smashes them anyway.  Like, dopes.  Well, Guns N' Roses had the chance to continue, and they just imploded.  So anyway, what else could you tell us about Spin Magazine, and all the stories you  wrote?  Well, you know, I had a gossip column for like six years, and I basically tried to make indie  rock kind of juicy, you know what I mean? 
[02:00:30]  Which isn't easy, because it's full of preppy, kind of fae, maybe non-sexy, non-celebrity  kind of guitar players and stuff like that.  So it was not-  Kind of hard to dig up kind of sexy dirt on those kind of people.  On like Steve Malkus from Pavement.  Yeah.  Not going to be caught.  Would you have informants and stuff?  Uh, yeah, I would get tipped off, yeah.  Yeah.  But it's like, you know, he's not- no one's going to get caught with their pants down kind  of thing.  Everyone's kind of too cool.  And they wouldn't really care, probably, either.  Yeah.  So, I mean, I just feel- I feel like it's just weird.  It's a weird emotional thing, because it's like, you know, eight years somewhere. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, you always hate getting the boot.  I was kind of spinning my wheels at the end, you know?  It's kind of like, you know, it started to repeat stories and stuff like that, or just  fall back on shtick that I knew-  You just open up a file and go to the back of it and go, yeah, we'll bring this one up  front again.  Like, my B notebook, you know what I mean?  But like, so I think they did kind of put me out of my misery a little bit, but like,  I could have probably gone out with a bit more, you know, dignity or something.  My last story-  No one gets to go out with dignity, by the way.  You realize that, you know, you think you're important, and you realize you're just not 
[02:01:30]  important in the end.  You know?  I'm not even- I'm not- it's not a slam against you.  It happened to us, too.  You think you're this very important thing to a company, and then they just one day go,  ah, we're done with you, and they just fire you, and there's no dignity to it.  I feel, honestly, like they just didn't feel like paying me what they've been paying me  anymore.  You know, I kind of earned over the years up to, you know, like, because I was publishing books,  and I got kind of a bit more of a readership outside of spin, so they, you know, they had  to pay me a bit more, and then they came in, and they just had to, you know, I guess save 
[02:02:00]  millions of dollars, and I just went down the toilet with like-  One of the cuts.  Yeah.  What do you think- what do you think of today's music?  Um, you know, I- I kind of-  And where did it change?  Because I'm starting to get bored with today's music.  Well, I don't know.  I'm in my, like, mid-30s, so I don't- I mean, I feel like I've become that kind of big chill  person now, whereas, like, before I was just like-  I made a point to be up on everything, and now I just, like, like, my girlfriend is  25, and she goes to- she writes for the NME, which is this British Music Weekly, and she 
[02:02:30]  goes to everything, and after a point, I just found myself just standing there with my arms  crossed, going, like, this sounds like music I listened to in high school, and I'm old,  and I should stop.  You feel like the old guy?  Yeah.  No longer down in the pit.  I like this when it was Echo and the Bunnymen, you know, in 1986.  How'd you feel about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame out of the night?  I- you know, I- were you guys there?  Did you guys go to the-  Oh, Jimmy was there.  Jimmy went.  Yeah.  Well, I thought it was about time that Sabbath got inducted. 
[02:03:00]  I- I-  Thank you.  You are now Jimmy's best friend.  Thank you.  I interviewed Ozzy when he was promoting his box set last year, and it was over the phone,  but, like, the first thing I said, because, like, they just inducted, like, Jackson Brown  or something, like, last year, or something like that, I was like, I want- I want to- I want to tell you,  Ozzy, I think it's a fucking travesty that Sabbath aren't in this, and he's, like, he just went off on it.  He's like, you know, it's a jam.  I don't jam.  I jam at the end, and it's like- and he's like- he's like, Paul Schaefer, what the fuck is that?  It's not rock and roll, you know, and stuff like that.  Do you have any pictures from that Rock and Roll Hall of Fame over there, Mr. Do-Nothing? 
[02:03:30]  Mr. Do-Nothing?  He rock is working hard.  I know he is, but I want my pictures, so I have to be bossy.  Yeah, Jimmy got a picture with the entire band, and, uh, it's pretty much the pinnacle of his entire life.  He's the pinnacle of anybody's life.  In his existence, this guy is the biggest Sabbath fan you'll ever see on the face of the earth.  It's weird Ozzy showed up, though, because he genuinely didn't seem to care.  I think the rest of the band wanted to do it, too.  In my chats with Tone, you know, I've kind of-  Yeah.  I think the rest of the band wanted-  I think he threw the rest of the band a bone and said, all right, it's really important to you guys more than myself, and I'll show up. 
[02:04:00]  Well, I'm sure Sharon wanted them to, too.  I mean, it's good for sale.  It's kind of the greatest hits thing, I mean.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Yeah, for financial reasons, they're not dumb.  That's a lot of press, man.  The Blondie thing was amazing yesterday.  Oh, the-  And I didn't realize when they were having that exchange, because we only heard the audio, that the guy was right in her face.  Yeah.  Saying, hey, are we allowed to play with you tonight?  No.  And she's like, no, not tonight, or whatever.  No, I got my band up here.  Right.  I thought Blondie was being inducted.  Yeah, the band.  They're all suing each other or whatever, and there you go. 
[02:04:30]  There's the picture of Jimmy with Black Sabbath.  Is that the greatest shot you've ever seen?  Ozzy looks like 10 to 15 years younger than everyone else in the band.  Yeah, he's just-  And he's looking at the camera.  It doesn't look like he is, but he's just-  He's kind of on a tilt, hanging out.  Sure.  You're convincing yourself.  I saw the eyes.  I zoomed in.  You got the perfect shot.  Dude, I zoomed in on the eyes.  I still think Ozzy's looking off to the side a little bit.  So the Blondie were not backstage together?  Like, they couldn't have worked that out?  Jimmy, no.  No, no.  Zoom in on the eyes, Hawk. 
[02:05:00]  Excuse me.  Zoom in on Ozzy's eyes.  How many times, though?  Because I know you.  How many times did you look at that picture and go, man, is he looking at the camera or not?  Because if he's not looking at the camera, it's not a perfect shot.  Somewhere between 3 and 1,500.  No, be honest.  I am.  A lot.  Okay, good.  But I am zooming in.  I'll tell you one thing.  But now you're convinced that he was looking at the camera.  I know he was.  I looked at the eyes.  I zoomed in on the eyes.  I told you, Anthony.  I told you.  But I'll tell you one thing.  Because it's not good enough to get a picture with the entire band.  Now it has to be the perfect picture.  They all have to be, you know, looking at the same camera. 
[02:05:30]  A second before Ozzy, the picture was taken, Ozzy was laughing and looking away.  And I actually went, okay, guys.  I actually said that to the Sabbath.  Because Ozzy was fucking goofing off.  To get them all looking.  Like, looking.  He was laughing at Tony Dennis or somebody on the side.  I'm like, fuck.  And my friend got the camera.  I didn't want the camera to show it off.  So I'm like, you know, like, all right, look at the black guy.  I think I told him, look at Earl.  And then he did actually.  Look at the black guy.  Do you geek out when you meet your heroes?  No, I'm usually pretty collected.  I'm awful.  Yes, I do.  That's the thing that's been, is I met, I met, like, over eight years, too, like, so many 
[02:06:00]  of my heroes.  And I just tried to, you have to.  Like who?  Like who?  Who was the biggest one?  Or who was one that you were, like, fuck?  Morrissey, I think, was the biggest one.  Really?  Yeah.  I just, I had to, like, I met him at the Beverly Hills Hotel the first time.  And I went into the Polo Lounge and I had three Bloody Marys, like, back.  And they cost, like, 20 bucks there or something.  And it was just, like, and it still, like, was, it was, like, noon.  And it was, like, I never got.  Yeah, and it was still, like, I was still.  What was it about Morrissey?  I never got into Morrissey.  I was just, I was just, I was just one of them. 
[02:06:30]  You know, I was, like, the Smiths fan in high school and it just never went away.  You were that kid?  I never outgrew it.  Jesus Christ.  So you were really close to killing yourself many, many times, huh?  Yeah, right?  That's the Morrissey thing.  Yeah.  I know.  I was never into Morrissey or his crowd or his fans.  But the equivalent, I mean, I remember I met the B-52s, which was, like, huge at the time also.  And the Jesus of Mary.  All the bands I listened to growing up, but I never thought I would meet.  I was not supposed to meet. 
[02:07:00]  Like, Robert Smith from The Cure.  I sat, like, in a hotel square right across from him.  There was another band where it's, like, wow, you fell right into that whole thing, didn't you?  I was a sad, confused person.  I didn't mind The Cure.  The Cure, great.  I didn't mind The Cure.  He's a great guitar player, too.  He's underrated as a guitar player.  How close were you to, like, with the black eyeliner?  Were you goth?  There are photos somewhere.  Are there?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's all right.  We all got them.  You didn't wear the thin ties growing up, though, did you?  I wore everything that you probably shouldn't wear. 
[02:07:30]  I had a friend like that, man.  Plock of Seagulls was doing that crazy crap with their hair, and my best friend at the time  had to show up with this crazy hair.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Don't do that.  Not that one.  And then it was the stray cats, and that was the stray cat's hair.  See, Jimmy's studying the Aussie picture to make sure he's looking at the camera.  He's kind of looking away, dude.  No, he's not actually.  I've seen on my own copy.  I've seen it.  It's clear.  It's blatant.  He's looking at it.  I was obsessed with it.  Yeah.  He is.  Yes.  See, I knew it. 
[02:08:00]  I knew it.  No one's ever come in here who's, like, tripped you out?  Aussie.  Yeah, Aussie freaked him out.  But you have to remember your job, right?  Early on, it was really, like, freaky.  I think my first big celebrity interview, rock interview, was backstage in Worcester, the  Worcester Centrum.  And Eddie Van Halen came walking back, and I stuck a mic in his face and asked him a couple  of questions.  And I couldn't concentrate on anything except, holy shit, that's Eddie Van Halen, like, three  inches from me.  You know, he was just, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, whatever he was saying, I couldn't listen 
[02:08:30]  to it.  And all you're thinking is, Eddie Van Halen, Eddie Van Halen, Eddie Van Halen.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what it was.  Eddie Van Halen, Eddie Van Halen.  Just looking at him going, holy shit, there he is.  For me, it was comedians.  I met Sam Kitteson.  That was unbelievable.  I got a great shot.  Yeah, you do.  And he's looking right at the camera.  He absolutely is.  Not a kind of a way like Aussie.  I would display it, but the sweater I'm wearing is the silliest sweater that anyone has ever  worn in their life, and that's the only reason I don't throw it on a website. 
[02:09:00]  And then it was George Carlin and Dave Grohl, because I'm a huge Nirvana fan, and that's  the closest I was going to get to Kurt Cobain.  He's very down to earth, too.  You forget.  Dave Grohl is like, you feel like he will just go out and drink beers with you.  No problem.  Would you want to meet Courtney Love?  Nah, I could care less about her.  Okay.  I met Courtney.  How is she?  Yeah.  She's great.  I never see what anyone else sees.  Like, when she's around me and we're talking, she's lucid, and she knows a lot.  She knows a lot about rock and roll.  Gabbed up skank. 
[02:09:30]  No, she's really...  Wait a minute.  I do have two Sam Kinison pictures.  One is proudly displayed on our Demented World CD.  That's where it should be.  With a radio station sweatshirt on.  This is a better picture than the sweater picture that I got.  The Carlin, too, man.  Yeah, the Carlin thing was amazing.  Yeah, that was...  When George and I did TV together.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  No, no, because I had some video with him.  We did the sketch and the whole thing, and then we got the pictures.  You know how it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Congrats.  At the end, by the end, I was just jaded. 
[02:10:00]  I would be like...  I would ask Kid Rock to buy me a drink.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And he actually gave me a $100 bill.  Oh.  So it's good that...  I mean, they kind of...  They kind of...  So maybe it's good that they fired me, because it probably was heading towards like a car crash.  Yeah.  And I always liked Spin Magazine more than like Rolling Stone and stuff.  They seemed to be more with it.  Yeah.  Not anymore.  Don't expect it.  I don't think...  Oh, with the new...  Oh, don't buy it at all, right?  No.  Yeah, because they just fucked me over.  So it's got to be changing.  Dude, why do magazines like Spin and Rolling Stone? 
[02:10:30]  Like, why do they always ignore Sabbath?  It's like the people that are supposed to know music.  Like, I mean, why do they always ignore them?  I don't know.  I mean, I think Sabbath is kind of the 21st century, Jimmy.  No, but I mean, even historically, they ignored them.  And they...  Like, the Stones are a great band.  I mean, obviously, they deserve all the attention they get.  But why is it 98 to 2?  There's not that much of a difference.  Sabbath has never been on the cover of Rolling Stone?  No, Ozzy was not on the cover of Rolling Stone until the Osbournes was on TV.  And like you said, guys like Jackson Brown and that type of shit. 
[02:11:00]  The problem was that Black Sabbath was ahead of their time.  Okay.  It was as simple as that.  I mean, Metallica went through that for a while.  They were ahead of their time until that Black album hit.  Like, the kids knew who they were, but the media maybe didn't.  But yeah, but mainstream is like, they were just ahead of their time.  If Black Sabbath came out the same time as Metallica, it would have been a different story.  They would have been all over the place just like Metallica was.  Once they hit, it's like, yeah, they sold out.  The original fans hate them.  Getting back into today's music.  So, I mean, what is your opinion about it? 
[02:11:30]  To me, it seems like it's all watered down and there's no real...  There's no one that is in the lead.  I don't know how to explain this, but there's no one that's just like a Nirvana or a Guns  and Roses when we were growing up or what have you.  It just seems like it's really thinned out.  There are so many more bands that people are into.  I think if you count the amount of bands there were in 1991 when Nevermind came out,  and the amount of bands now, it's probably something like a hundred times more.  Like, there's just, like, you know, with the internet and with sites and MP3s and iTunes 
[02:12:00]  and everything, it's just, I don't think there will be another U2 or Nirvana.  And I think that, like, you know, Coldplay probably wanted that,  but maybe didn't get there as, you know, naturally.  I just, I think it's over that period.  But then I'm talking like the old person that I am.  Until we build colonies on Mars.  No, you know what?  But you do make a good point.  The future of rock and roll is...  Right.  You do make a good point.  When we were growing up, we didn't have the iPods and the internet,  so you got into the bands and basically heard on the radio, 
[02:12:30]  so they told us what we liked.  Yeah, there won't be a great album.  Right.  It was so hard to go out.  Never another Benny Goodman.  Let me tell you, kids.  But it was so hard to go out and find these more obscure bands.  It was just, but now you can with the internet and the iPods.  Did you ever think that maybe the Rolling Stones and U2 are what they are  because they come about one every 10, 12, 15 years sometimes?  Yeah, but where is the equivalent now?  I mean, is it the way?  Maybe that, you know, we're kind of in between, you know? 
[02:13:00]  He did he.  And that shit.  Actually, I was listening to Top Tracks this weekend,  and they played Stairway to Heaven, and I haven't heard it in a long time.  Because I just stayed and listened to it.  Yeah, I don't listen to commercial radio anymore,  where they will shove that song down your throat a million times.  But I haven't heard it in a while, so I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to check out Stairway again.  It's been a while, and I listened to it.  And then I was thinking to myself, if this song came out today,  would it be as huge as it is?  I think so.  Would it get the exposure that it did back in the day? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  I mean, would everyone come together and go,  holy crap, this is one of the greatest songs ever recorded?  Different time, though.  Yeah.  That's what I mean, though.  I mean, with the iPod generation and all that.  Well, that's why so many things have to come together.  It can't just be a great band.  There has to be a whole timing issue with where are we now as even, like, a society.  You know, like when Nirvana hit, if Nirvana came out at the peak of the hairband thing,  they'd been overlooked because people were so into the hairband thing, 
[02:14:00]  they would have been like, who the fuck are these guys?  Go back to your garage or something.  You know, people were sick of that whole thing.  Right.  There was another generation kind of growing into their own and their own music,  and Nirvana kind of was their voice, and that's when it worked.  There have probably been bands that maybe five years, give or take, would have been huge.  Right.  But they fell off timing-wise.  Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.  Yeah.  I was listening to Stairway to Heaven.  It also depends on how edgy you are or, like, what you mean to people, like, would it be considered original? 
[02:14:30]  Like, there was a time when Tootie Fruity was, like, an edgy rock song.  Right, right.  But, like, is there a song that came out in the last couple of years that should be as big as Stairway to Heaven,  but because, you know...  Biggest Stairway, huh?  Don't forget they got 30 years of Stairway, too, though.  That's what I mean, too.  And that's why I don't think you're going to have songs as huge as Stairway to Heaven,  or name your favorite rock song from that ear, because you're not going to get the airplay over and over and over again on regular radio anymore. 
[02:15:00]  It's classic rock.  You're just not going to...  It's just not going to happen anymore.  Yeah, that's true.  So you're not going to have that over-the-top exposure with the music.  And, again, you have a lot of options out there these days.  The kids are too well-versed with the kind of behind-the-music history of rock and roll now.  So, like, I think Nirvana was the last band who could, like, legitimately go through it, like, from beginning, middle to end.  Whereas, like, now there's, like, I was out with The Strokes when they were kind of, you know, supposedly, like, the next big thing, like, saviors of rock and roll. 
[02:15:30]  And they were so aware of the fact that they were supposed to be saving rock and roll.  Because I think Nirvana were just like, we're Nirvana, we're going to go out and...  Exactly.  There's, like, a self-consciousness now.  I do like The Strokes, but I don't like that about them where they're like, okay, everyone's taking a look at us.  And just do your thing.  Just do your thing.  Self-consciousness, or is it an arrogance?  No, they're nice guys, man.  I mean, you know, they're...  We talk about this a lot.  We went to...  They're shy.  We went to OzFest in Philly and broadcast live. 
[02:16:00]  But, you know, this is about four years ago now, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe four years ago.  And I was so bummed out being backstage.  And I've been lucky enough over my radio career to be backstage a lot.  And when we went to OzFest that summer, that's when I realized, oh, my God, this whole music thing is so freaking different than when it was, let's say, 10 years prior.  These guys were walking around all tattooed up and had to look like they were tough and they were, like, heroin addicts and this and that. 
[02:16:30]  But they're having veggie meals and drinking spring water.  It's like L.A. exploded.  And they're all online, like, asking how, you know, how many carbs is in this and do you have a vegetarian meal and do you have something with less fat?  And then, you know, we were lucky enough to now be in the stands checking out these same bands we saw backstage.  And they're on stage with that attitude rocking.  And I'm like, dude, you were eating a fucking salad and drinking water backstage.  That's, like, why Axl is so disappointing now.  Because I think he was legitimately, like, that rocker guy, you know, who would throw the Jack Daniels back. 
[02:17:00]  And now he's, like, we've slowly watched him become.  And, like, rock has maybe changed with him.  Like, he's a perfect, like, singer.  But now, I guess the point I'm making, nowadays they're just playing the part.  Yeah.  You know, it's not about what they are personally.  They're playing what they think is the rock and roll star.  And we did get filled from Pantera that day.  And he kind of brought it back to reality.  Yeah, thank you.  You're 100% right.  Wow.  He came by and he was on something.  They swear he wasn't on the H.  He was on everything. 
[02:17:30]  He was on, yeah.  The guy, he couldn't even walk by himself.  They had two guys bring him to the interview area.  And then I was like, okay, it's still out there a bit.  You've got to look a little harder.  Best line ever.  Death is overrated.  Yeah, he told us death was overrated.  It's still the stamp of authenticity, heroin addiction.  Yeah.  Yeah, that kind of gives you that credibility.  But I was bummed out that day.  And I lost a little bit of the whole getting excited to be backstage and rock music in general.  I'm like, these guys are just playing the part.  They're more into being considered socially brilliant and poignant instead of just getting pussy and being fucking animals. 
[02:18:00]  Like, rock guys have always been.  Like, rock guys always seem to be, like, poignant accidentally.  Like, you know, maybe they were aware of it, but they were such good actors, they didn't show up.  But it just seems like the social relevance of a lot of music, people didn't realize how socially relevant they were until everybody had told them.  And now they're trying so hard to be socially relevant and to mean something, man.  I think it's cyclical, too, you know?  I think that happens, like, every few years you get that whole thing where the bands come out and they're poignant and have to have meaning. 
[02:18:30]  And then there's just, you know, a few years past, people get sick of that and they want their drug addicts back.  Yeah.  And then it goes back again.  When in the 70s or the 80s?  Fucking Lemmy.  Huh?  Why is Lemmy not on the cover of Rolling Stone?  That man is a drunk.  He's the fucking greatest.  He's just an animal.  Three guys.  He's an animal.  Little tights.  He wasn't that great.  Lemmy?  Oh, dude, he fucking rules.  He wears white cowboy boots on the outside of his jeans.  He's the greatest thing ever.  You ever hear fucking 1916? 
[02:19:00]  I rest my case.  Let's go to Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey, Ope.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey, you guys are completely missing the point, just to you, Ope.  All the great bands were obscured, made themselves great.  Now they just put these corporations, just put these bands together.  They're just shit.  Corporations?  I'm not sure what you mean, though, dude.  Well, you know what I mean.  Like, P. Diddy puts together bands, and all these other companies, they put together bands,  and they're big, they're huge off the bat.  Nobody comes out of obscurity anymore. 
[02:19:30]  I think Chris is making a pretty good point.  You do get a band that has this raw talent, and then they get a hold of you, and then they  mold you, instead of you figuring it out on your own.  Right?  How come G.G.  Allen was never on the cover of Spin Magazine?  Because G.G.  Allen, to be honest with you, as much as he was an interesting guy, and an interesting  dude to listen to, musically, was not good.  No.  No, absolutely not.  But he was rock and roll.  He was more, no, he wasn't.  He was just a degenerate.  Rock and roll is different.  Rock and roll doesn't mean anarchy and throwing shit at the audience. 
[02:20:00]  I mean, rock and roll is crazy, and it's drugs, and it's chicks.  But it's not a lack of respect for your audience in a fucking warehouse somewhere, throwing  duty at them, with your cock sticking out, and fucking falling asleep.  Plus, he never killed himself on stage.  I'm a big punk guy, and even if I'm a punk, you know, watered down now, it's ridiculous.  All right, Chris, thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, most ridiculous situation you've gotten into with your name.  Oh.  Yeah, you know, like, if you were born at a certain, if you're like, you know, 30 or late 
[02:20:30]  20s, you keep, but like, there's some people, so many people now who don't even ask me that.  We were hoping to see gold medals today.  But I heard, because I heard, what do you guys think about having Mark Spitz on?  And I go, well, of course.  Why wouldn't we?  Thinking at first, sorry, but thinking the first name you hear when you hear Mark Spitz.  Yeah.  And it reminds me of Office Space with Michael Bolton.  Right.  But the thing is, I, you know, I should have changed, I had an excuse to change it, because  I'm, you know, I put out books and stuff like that, but like, I couldn't think of anything, 
[02:21:00]  like, I couldn't think of anything.  Really?  Like anything better.  Brian Boitano.  No?  Brian A. Boitano.  Right.  An A in there.  Let's go to Mark in Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, boys.  You know, there's no greater example of somebody who's one thing on stage and you think he's  all rocked out, and another off of it than Travis Parker from Blink-182.  Tattoos, Mohawk, everything's pierced.  And then you see him on his MTV show, and he's the biggest fucking pussy in the world. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, he's living in a mansion with, like, in a neighborhood with soccer moms.  You can't fault people for that?  Why would you have a problem with something like that?  Sounds like a wonderful way of life.  Sure does.  I don't think Keith Richards ever spoke like that voice.  Like Keith doesn't have a mansion somewhere.  I bet Keith's house is pretty nice.  Yeah, I bet it really is.  Nice decor.  I bet he can pick it up and take it on the road with the stones, too.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, that's a good one there, Mark.  That's funny.  I hate the Barkers.  It's like, this guy doesn't look like a rock star at all.  You don't feel like they're genuine, like a guy like Tommy Lee.  One minute he's the fucking rebel, the next minute he's fucking talking like he's in hip-hop.  It's just like this embarrassing attempt at being relevant and popular.  To fit in and be relevant, yeah.  And you look at other bands.  I mean, of course, I would raise Sabbath, but just for the sake of the audience, I'll say Robert Plant.  And those guys, they were just consistent.  That's who the guy was, and that's what made him loved and interesting. 
[02:22:30]  Now they're just trying so hard to be popular.  Let's go to Mark in Rockland County.  Mark?  Hey, this is Murph in Rockland County.  Sorry, Murph.  No disrespect.  Hey, God bless Black Sabbath in the first place.  Good point, Murph.  Good point.  Okay, I just want to ask this guy about bands like the Drive-By Truckers and the Bottle Rockets.  It's like Americana.  It's like modern CTR.  Oh, my God.  We interviewed the Bottle Rockets.  Yeah, they did.  Wow.  What was their hit song? 
[02:23:00]  I think they played it live for us.  Radar Gun.  Yeah.  Radar Gun.  Remember that, Anthony?  Of course.  These guys were good old boys, man.  Hillbillies, basically.  Well, there's a band, the Drive-By Truckers.  I know Spinner, Rolling Stone, always says they're America's greatest live band.  Can I, uh...  And they really are.  You've got to go see them when they come around.  This is the second time I've heard about Drive-By Truckers.  The first time was in Stephen King's column that he does for Entertainment Weekly.  Oh, no kidding.  Stephen King does...  We've been trying to get him on the show. 
[02:23:30]  He does a pop culture column in Entertainment Weekly that is just unbelievable.  And he was talking about the Drive-By Truckers, I believe.  Yeah, they're great.  They play a three-hour set.  They're a bunch of alcoholics.  Before they go on, they're drinking Jack.  They drink Jack on stage.  They just...  They're like...  In their late 30s, 40 years old, they're the real thing.  And they're...  What kind of music?  Is it like Southern rock or country?  It's modern-day Southern rock.  These guys are like...  It's like CCR if they were complete alcoholics today.  Do you know one of their hit songs? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Don't go obscure on us here.  I know.  I'm trying to...  I'm on the...  Just break out anything from the dirty South.  There's a Daddy's Cup, Father's Cup, or something like that.  But they've got three guitars, each one of them singing song, right?  So each record is complete.  It goes every which direction.  I'm telling you, they're the real shit.  Well, we want to play a little bit of Drive-By Truckers, but we need more of a popular song.  The record is the Dirty South. 
[02:24:30]  You can just bounce around there.  Oh, mister.  Never Going Back.  That was their hit off the Dirty South.  Never Going Back?  Yeah, something like that.  It's something along the line today.  All right, we'll take a look.  We'll try to find it.  Yeah, take a look.  I'm telling you, they're a great band.  All right, thank you, sir.  Okay, Lappin, you suck.  All right.  Told him.  Who sucks?  No idea.  I don't know.  Must be a friend.  It's good jukebox music, Drive-By Truckers.  Oh, there it is.  Let's get a taste of Drive-By Truckers. 
[02:25:00]  Never Going to Change.  No?  There you go.  I don't know. 
[02:25:30]  Let this be a lesson to you, girl  Don't come around where you know you don't belong  They're riding on the avenue  They're probably coming after you  And they all look mean and strong  Mean and strong like you  Mean and strong like fear 
[02:26:00]  Strong like the people from South Alabama  Mean like the people from here  You take it from me  And they're never gonna change  Daddy used to empty out his shotgun shells  And fill them full of black eyed peeps 
[02:26:30]  It ain't real low and you tear out your ankles  And rip right through your knees  There ain't much traffic on the highway  There ain't much traffic on the lake  Cause the ATF and the A.B.I.  Got everything they could take  Take it from me  They didn't take it from me 
[02:27:00]  Take it from me  We ain't never gonna change  We ain't doing nothing wrong  We ain't never gonna change  So shut your mouth and play along  Jimmy loves it  I like that  No you don't  This I really do  The guy's got a great voice  That's really  I was enjoying that very much  He had a really good voice 
[02:27:30]  Yeah I definitely like that  I'm gonna go check out some more drive-by truckers  Me too  Derek do that illegal downloading  You know what I'm gonna do for me  Did you see Skinner at the Hall of Fame?  I was busy backstage  I did see them  I was in the press room  So I was getting my photo at Sabbath  Chit-chatting with Tony and Geezer  That was always backstage  While they were playing free  I didn't care what they were doing  But the fact that it took  Lennon Skinner this long to be inducted  Just shows you how out of touch  And irrelevant  A lot of that thinking really is  Jackson Brown  Well the band was disrailed for  Yeah  For quite a few years  What's that?  They were disrailed 
[02:28:00]  Yeah they had an issue  Who?  They had a little bit of an issue  I don't think they really  I don't think they really cared about  Being in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Nah  Iggy  Iggy is still not  For a while  What was the big song  By Jackson Brown?  Maybe I'm missing it  What was Jackson Brown?  Loadout's Stay  Hear the song in Fast Times  Oh yeah  Is that it?  Got to be somebody's baby  How does that go?  Can we have a moment of Jackson Brown?  Got to be somebody's baby  Yeah put on the Jackson Brown Fast Times song  This is when  Where's Jennifer Jason Lee 
[02:28:30]  She's getting fucked in the dugout  She climbs out the window  By the stereo cell  Losing her virginity  What year did he  What year did he get into the Rock?  25 years you have to exist right?  Hey this is great iced tea  This is  Love that guy  This was a huge hit for Jackson Brown  I'm sure it was a massive hit  On your home of rock and roll  Hey this is the scene  When I'm in a pool cabana  And I come too quick  I just think you're getting fucked 
[02:29:00]  Anytime you hear this song  Jennifer Jason Lee  Is getting it somewhere  I wonder if her husband  Has to play this  When he fucks it  Yeah when he's banged  Or they just pop it on  You know as a goof  He's done that to her  I remember  Jesus is this  Fucking unlistenable  Hey Red  Would you get that  Out of the hamper  One of the best characters 
[02:29:30]  In any movie ever  Damone  And then there was  Running on empty  Thank you Ben  From the office  Well come on  Lawyers in love  Lawyers in love  Now that's one of my faves  That was the one to put him over  He wouldn't have been  In the hall of fame  Wouldn't have even come close  How many years  25 years in existence  To be in the hall  So what year did he go in  Did anybody know  A few years ago  I think it was like  Two  It was in a couple years  Probably closer to the first year  Or second year of eligibility  Right  Because he hasn't been  Rapping for 30 years  Has he  Yeah  He did load out  Stay 
[02:30:00]  One of the biggest rock songs  Ever  Since the late 70s  Which load out stay  Why don't you stay  Just a little bit longer  Remember that one  Anybody  Just a little bit longer  Yeah  Yeah  It's lovely  Yeah sure  That's up there  He got in early though  How about  Sure he should have  He's terrific  What about  What's his name  That was inducted  The jazz  Miles Davis  Miles Davis  I'm sorry  Does it belong to me  Rock and roll  Love  Miles Davis 
[02:30:30]  Stop  Not the rock and roll  Hall of fame  Defeats the  Love  Miles Davis  And do you ever  Just sit around  And just like  Have background music  On  No  Or do you need  The music to be  Front and center  And you have to  Rock along  I need it to be  What  You're reading the  Something I know  You're reading the  Sunday New York Times  What planet is this  And you got a cup of coffee  And you throw a  Miles Davis CD in  Nope  Why not  Look I'm not saying  You can't appreciate  Miles Davis  Are you checking out  Chill  Channel 84 on XM  XM 84  I have not even come close to it 
[02:31:00]  I look for great background music  I won't go to  The channels around it  Because I don't like it  Do you ever listen to  I don't even know what's on it  You listen to classical music  Classical  Ever  Sometimes  I  It's like Sunday morning type music  No  You know what I find  Classical music  It's depressing  It's soundtrack  To depression  No  There's nothing uplifting  About it  You walk into a house  Where classical music is playing  You expect to see a casket  Sitting somewhere  Where you're supposed to  Like kneel down  And give your respect 
[02:31:30]  It's not music where  I want to be  I want music to  Lift me up  That's why I'll play  ABBA  Who are not in the hole  I will play  ABBA  There's a song  I got some good  Overture to the Sun  Fantastic  Classical  Oh my god  I know this one  Jimmy  Who doesn't  Oh and everyone knows  Like the songs  They try to be cool  By knowing the song's  Real classical name  Instead of  The theme  The Lone Ranger 
[02:32:00]  That was  No don't you know  That is  The Polovetsian Dance  Number 3  By Borodin  Remember that old  Codder on that commercial  From years and years ago  No it scares me  That might be the real answer  I don't even want to ask him  It is the real answer  And there's other ones  Like  Is that really the answer  It might be  I'm not sure what that song  I remember because  There was an album out  Years ago  When I was growing up  And it was classical songs  And he would say  You might remember this  As the theme  To The Lone Ranger 
[02:32:30]  Did you realize  It was actually called  And then all of these  And more can be yours  If you order now  Jimmy  Overture  We need a little more info  Overture  It's from Clockwork Orange  Oh okay  It's a great  It's not a Clockwork theme  It's not a Beethoven song  Yeah but we can't find  Ludwig Van  Lovely lovely  Ludwig Van  Ludwig Van  Yeah  Is it by Mozart  Or Wagner  I would guess Mozart  Wagner  Wagner  Mr. Classical 
[02:33:00]  No it's Wagner  Robert Wagner  I will  I saw my Robert Wagner  It's called  Get the Scuba Gear  It was done by  Oh shit  Wow  Oh that is nasty  Wow  Alright  We need the real name  Of the dance song  Do we have anything  From Clockwork Orange  In there Hawk  Does it look harder  Or this bottle's coming over  I gotta hang up  On a bunch of people  Because we gotta find  The answer  This  Nah that's the  William Tell Overture  I know 
[02:33:30]  William Tell Overture  Not that one  No  Let's see  It's a great scene though  Alright we'll go to Ray  In the meantime  From New Mexico  Ray what's up  Hey man  What's going on  Hey  Hey man  Alright listen  You're naming bands  That started  Over 10 years ago  I'm talking about  Bands that are  Coming out now  What's hitting you now 
[02:34:00]  In the last two years  I loved all those bands too  And continue to love them  What  Huh  System of the Down  Is up there  You'd be surprised  They've been around  A while now  Maybe not 10  But they're  They're probably  Up to 7 years now  I saw them on the  Second stage  Of Oz Fest  Oh Jesus  But if a band  Don't freaking party  Oh man  I'm fucking Satan  I'll talk to you  Wow punch out  The call is going good  Oh my god  Punch out  You're going in Maverick  And that guy's  Missing our point  I don't care if my bands 
[02:34:30]  Don't party  But don't make believe  You do  Be who you are  The honesty in the music  Be who you are  That's what I'm saying  Yes  Oh my point about  Miles Davis  Is he didn't belong  In the rock and roll  I don't know man  Put him in the jazz  Hall of fame  You're going to lose  That argument  Why  That's not rock and roll  No one into rock and roll  Is listening to Miles Davis  It's not rock and roll  It's music  It's jazz  It's music  I think  It's okay  Then who else should be  In the rock and roll  I know what you're saying  I know what you're saying  What about the trombone player 
[02:35:00]  Put him in there  Hey Kenny G  When is Kenny G  Going to be fucking put in  In another 15 years  You think so  Did Miles Davis have any  Fusion stuff with rock and roll  Yeah I think he invented it  Is why he's in there  He invented like  Shitty rock fusion  Actually I invented it  Bitches Brew  That's a rock and roll  What is that  Bitches Brew  Thank you Ben  What is Bitches Brew  Bitches Brew  Is like kind of a rock album  And what's that  Kind of a rock album  Give me something off  Bitches Brew  Bitches  What was Miles Davis'  Masterpiece  Something blue  Kind of blue  Kind of blue  Thank you  I love that album 
[02:35:30]  What the hell is it  Rock and roll  It's jazz  I don't like it  I think jazz is awful  Rock and roll is an attitude man  It's the best selling jazz album ever  Yeah listen  Listen to kind of blue  His instrument talks man  Shut up it does not  It tells a story  It says where's my needle  I weigh 12 pounds  It tells a story man  I don't buy it  It's not that bad  Fucking unlistenable direct jazzes  Exactly  Oh it's horrible  Go listen to kind of blue 
[02:36:00]  And then come in and talk about it  They're all great musicians  Jazz musicians are great musicians  But it's like  Could you cocksuckers rehearse once  Each one thinks they're better  Than the other guy with them in the band  So they all gotta outdo each other  And it winds up just sounding like this mishmash  I know  I don't sound very cultured when I talk like this  I don't either  It stinks jazz  You heard it here  Jazz  Stinks  We got any Miles  I'm not gonna say I'm a jazz fan  I'm a Miles Davis fan  Give me some rockin' Miles  Give me some Miles Davis that rocks 
[02:36:30]  Alright well let's go to kind of blue  Well Bitches Brew is a nice one  Go to uh  We don't have any Miles Davis in the old computer  Gotta be  Gotta be  I would find that before you get shaven with the back of my hand  Where's  Alright here's Bitches Brew  Now play Bitches Brew  Bitches Brew  It's 27 minutes long by the way  Holy shit is it  Hey man  We wanted to call it in today anyway  Is it really  And you'll hear it here  And enjoy  In it's entirety 
[02:37:00]  Right  Ah yes  Pee you already  It gets going  This is a tuning session  He's tuning  We're like halfway through it  Halfway through it  Halfway through it  Yeah man  It will sound exactly like this  Yeah  Guaranteed  Halfway through  Right there  Ah yes  That's like a Muppet  Anthony's trying to jump out the window 
[02:37:30]  I tried to jump out the window  Let it be known  This is so god awful  I can't even tell you  Who fucking enjoys this  You know what I can't fake it  I don't like this either  It stinks  How can you like it  Go to  Mark  What do you think  I think it's one of those records you're supposed to like  Yeah  Like you put it in your little thing  So you're cool  It's a rock stop record  Yeah  So people read and go 
[02:38:00]  Wow is that  Yeah man I like it too  No  I'm stupid  And I hate it  Yeah I have records like that on my iPod  That I never ever listen to  Oh by the way  We gotta move along here  Because we got Jimmy Johnson calling in  Oh shit  He won another NASCAR race  And we gotta get to him in about 15 minutes  But first Larry in D.C.  Larry  Larry  Hey Jimmy  You're gonna find your dog dead in the hallway Larry  What you're looking for Jimmy  Is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony  The choral finale  Also called Ode to Joy 
[02:38:30]  Because a poem by a guy named Schiller over in Germany  Was put to that music  I love Ode to Joy  But that's not the one I mean  The one I mean is Overture to the Sun  It's a different one  I like this  This is great  I can sing you one bar of the Ode to Joy  And it's the most famous thing from Clockwork Orange  This is fucking great  It's Ode to Chernobyl  Yeah yeah no I know that  Yeah that one  It's great  I play that in my house every day 
[02:39:00]  It's wonderful  This is one of the best shot scenes ever  Okay  Punch it out  This is not depressing  No this isn't depressing classical music  This is good classical  It's great  It's calming  It's calming  It's very  Yeah I like calming music  In this scene right now  Alex is jerking off  And they show his face  And the camera is fucking panning  He has a little thing  A statue  It's four Christs together  Uh huh  And Kubrick was  His director of Star Wars is a genius 
[02:39:30]  That like to the beat  He's panning on different parts of the Christ  Like their hands  Their heads  Their feet  It's fucking amazing  If anybody remembers that scene  To the beat of the music  It's just great  Which has nothing to do with the song  This is good stuff  Yeah alright  But you know  It's very limited with me  I could listen to a little bit of that  Over show to the sun  You'd like if I could find it  I just want to wear this as a hat  So bad you have no idea  This bag  I've been fighting the urge to put that on  And just make it a hat  It would be the funniest thing 
[02:40:00]  I've ever seen  I didn't want to break the room up  Personally  Alright listen  Let's uh  Well Mark you got a book out  We gotta talk about the book for a couple minutes  Yeah too much too late  And what's the book about?  Um it's a story of a band called the Jane Aschers  And they kind of were together in the 90s  Around like the grunge era  And then they broke up  And kind of lived normal lives  And then they get discovered by a blogger  Um  That's racist  And get really  And they get really huge and famous in their 40s  And how they cope  How they cope  It's about growing up within rock and roll 
[02:40:30]  And how  You know I've been on  I've been on tour with bands  Who handled it well  And I've been on tour with bands  Who kind of fell apart  So I figured it was a good theme to kind of examine  And you know it's a comedy  You know it's really funny  And it's kind of raunchy in places  But also kind of sweet  You know it's like  It's my first like adult book I guess  You've cast it in your head already have you?  Oh yeah  The movie?  No people ask me  You know  And my last book  How soon is never  Is being produced now  And I still don't see  Like I don't see actors

No but it's  But it is  I've been told I write  You know like  Good dialogue  And it would be  You know  Translate well to film  But  I can play any part you want  I'm fucking good  Jimmy's a good actor  You can read from it  If you want  Hey who told you  This was a good picture of you  On the back cover  Oh they  It's  Jesus  Wow  He'll admit it  I know  You look miserable  Look at the guy that was  File trading with Gary Glitter 
[02:41:30]  Right  When you pull back  You'll see  You'll see the bar  But it looks like  You're still listening to Morrissey  Quite frankly  No I  It looks like it's a picture  From a webcam or something  Oh you're acting?  I was reading  Oh wait  Let Jimmy act out a little bit  Yeah go ahead  You need to get over there  I'll go with you  Bravo  Bravo  Wow you are good  It's not a depressing book  Even though I look morose

I don't know  Is it in your favorites?  I don't know  It's in my favorites  Alright see if the poll is up there  Also we got a little press in the Daily News again today  We got a couple little hits in the Daily News  This is called stalling 
[02:44:30]  Because Jimmy Johnson's calling any minute  And we can't get into anything too involved right now  I know what I'd like to get into after Mr. Johnson calls though  What?  I'd love to get into train kills Miss Deaf Texas  Oh shit  That's right  That happened today  Tragic  It happened a couple days ago  I think  Do we have audio of it?  The actual story?  News story?  Or the actual death?  The audio of the death  Of the death  David Hinkley in the Daily News  Just something quick about us today  Michael Harrison  Editor of Talkers Magazine  Told Opie and Anthony last week 
[02:45:00]  It was an oversight not to put O&A  Among the top 100 talk show hosts  Talkers annual list had O&A in its second tier  Yes  And David Hinkley not really helping us out  Because Michael Harrison actually went on to say that  We would have been 6 or 7  Number 6 or 7 is a far cry from just the top 100  And by the way we have blown off  Going on the front cover of Talkers Magazine  For the faithful listeners  That we're following that story  Screw them  Yes  Yes we blew that off  But I say  We're not going to be on the cover 
[02:45:30]  Doing something wacky  I wanted you to do something not wacky though  Like what?  We don't know what that is  I don't know  We should all put our little heads together  I think you can come up with something that's not wacky  And then we made a lowdown in the same paper  The New York Daily News  It's the gossip page in the paper  What's the lowdown  In snark attack  What is that?  What's snark mean?  Can you get the Isaac Hayes thing  Because we've got to play that again real fast  Oh that looks good  It's going to make the room smell all cinnamony  I like cinnamony 
[02:46:00]  You want one?  Jimmy?  Nah you eat it  You're hungry  Who cares about me?  I'll give you a piece of raisin toast  For that fine glove  I like raisin toast  Oh no  Smell it Jimmy  I smell it from here  What do you say?  It's an even trade  It's an even trade  It's an even trade  No?  It is delicious  But do we know what snark means?  Snark attack?  No  It's kind of like shark but with an N  Oh okay  That explains it then  Thanks Jimmy  No but it's like  Black shark  It's snark attack with a big exclamation point 
[02:46:30]  And then  And they make the same point you made yesterday  Of course they did  What point was that?  Did someone get to Isaac Hayes?  Uh huh  This is exactly what you said yesterday  Scientologist Hayes was the voice of Chef on South Park  But just quite the  But just quit sorry  The Comedy Central hit citing intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs  Only last December  Hayes went on Opie and Anthony's XM radio show  And didn't mind a recent episode ridiculing Tom Cruise and Scientology 
[02:47:00]  Yep  One thing about Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the South Park creators  They lampoon everybody  And if you take that shit serious  Then I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge for $2  I ain't buying  Yep  That was uh  That was him on this show  Well here's the actual audio  Hey my question is for Isaac Hayes  Yo  Hey  Yo  What did you think?  You're Scientologists right?  Yeah  Okay what did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on South Park about Scientology? 
[02:47:30]  Well  With Cruz in the closet  Well  Yeah that was a great episode  So they reran it I think last week too  Yeah one thing about  One thing about Matt and Trey  They lampoon everybody  Mmhmm  And if you uh  If you take that shit serious  Then I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge for $2  Yeah  Yeah  You gotta realize what they're doing  Yeah that's what they do  Oops  Oh and now he's saying he quits  Uh because of what they did  Their intolerance  Right  For religion  Well your religion  Cause they have been doing uh 
[02:48:00]  Religious parodies and goofs for  For years on that show  For the entire time he was chef  And uh  Scientology though  And Scientologists  Don't like criticism  They've always been rabid  The Scientologists  About uh  Defending their faith  And they go after people  With huge teams of lawyers  Uh if you criticize them  But I think nowadays  A few years back  If you wrote an article  About Scientology  You'd have lawyers  Their lawyers  On your ass  Uh and even if you were right 
[02:48:30]  It would cost you a lot of money  To defend yourself  Nowadays though  Uh with the wonderfulness  Of the internet  And everything  And blogs  And you can  Criticize all you want  A lot of people do  And they just don't have  The resources to cover everything  You think they got  Isaac Hayes though  So now what they're doing  Is pretty much staying internal  And keeping their own people  Straight  So somebody absolutely  Got to him and said  What the fuck are you stupid  What are you crazy  You don't go on a show  And talk about 
[02:49:00]  We're out there  Talking about how  That was awful  For them to play that  On South Park  And a character  On South Park  Is a Scientologist  And he's saying  Oh  It's no big deal  Now you quit  You know who asked  For the audio  Keith Oberman  Really  Asked for the audio  They might do something  With it on MSNBC  Keith Oberman is still  Having a very good time  Doing this show  Unlike Bill O'Reilly  Oh Bill's miserable  Bill O'Reilly is miserable  Dude  That audio 
[02:49:30]  Of Bill O'Reilly  Threatening  A caller  With some type  Of legal action  For mentioning  Another person  It is so  Desperate  So  So  Like he's talking  To three year olds  He's out of touch  As a daddy  Now you don't do that  Just chastising  His listeners  Like they're children  And  Keith's response 
[02:50:00]  To it is  Hysterical  Do we have that audio still?  I hope so  I see  A madman  Pawing through  CDs right now  I know  No it's alright  Oh my god  He's going crazy  There it is  Thanks Iraq  Yeah  This is  This is what  This douchebag O'Reilly  Is all about  And he really is  Another guy that just  Doesn't know how to  Have fun anymore  Doesn't know how to  Have fun  And  And he's out of  His mind  How do you think 
[02:50:30]  You can threaten  People  To this degree  For calling into  A radio show  Regardless of what  You're saying  You can say  Whatever you want  You can say  You can curse  You're not going to  Get in trouble  You can criticize  The host  You can mention  Other people's names  Other radio hosts  Names  Doesn't matter  There's no  Legal recourse  Unless you do  Something like  Make a threat  Against someone's life  Against the president  Or sing a copywritten song  Oh that'll get you  In big trouble  Jimmy  Well we gotta  Put this on hold 
[02:51:00]  Oh  We got a big  Big star on the phone  Jimmy Johnson  Yes  Congratulations sir  Thank you so much  Another victory  For Jimmy Johnson  It's been a good  Start to the season  A good start  You're the points leader  My friend  Yes  And you're blowing off  Races here and there  At times  Didn't you blow off  One race  No  No  We're gonna  We're gonna  Stick in there  Keep trucking  Lots of trophies  That's the goal  And a big goal  Is that big trophy  At the end of the year  That NASCAR passes out 
[02:51:30]  For the champions  So hopefully we can do that  What was I reading though  You blew off a race  For something  Was that last season then  No  Oh forget it  We can joke about  Something like that  No it's okay  That's never happened  I mean we can say  That you know  I had a big night  The night before  And just didn't feel  Like doing my job  But not the case  So what is it  What's giving you  The success  It's uh  I mean I know  You guys hear it  All the time  And  Hold on a minute  Jimmy Johnson  What  I don't want to  Be made the fool today 
[02:52:00]  What's  Why's that  While he took  A week off  Of racing  NASCAR went to  Mexico last week  You didn't go to  Mexico  No that's for  The Bush series  Oh okay  That's where I was  Confused  I told him  He and Jeff Gordon  Went snowboarding  You thought you had me  Didn't you  I told him  I'm like that was  The Bush series  No no no  But there's a reason  I bring this up  Why would I bring that up  It's boring  Yeah you missed a race  Who cares  But I like this  Little story though  That was attached to it  All right so  Instead of doing that  You and Jeff Gordon  Went snowboarding 
[02:52:30]  Okay  There was a whole group  Of us  We had a blast up  There in Aspen  Snowboarding  Very cool  You were in Aspen  Yes  So you're a California guy  And you're hooked  With the celebs  So we here  Yeah  Know a couple guys  All right here's the story  Because he's a celebrity  The paparazzi got a shot  Of Jimmy's wife  Getting out of a limo  With Nick Lachey  See he's laughing  You want to know  What the limo was  What was the limo  The car that I was driving  And if you look in the photo  You can see where  They totally cropped me out 
[02:53:00]  My arms there  Like holding my wife's shoulder  Really  They totally cropped me out  And like have a picture  With Nick standing next to my wife  And try to make something out of it  Thank you  That's the story I'm getting into  This is what the paparazzi do  Wow  Bastards  So Nick Lachey is getting out  That's flattering to you Jimmy  You must have a  I don't know what your wife looks like  But the paparazzi thinks  She's a fine piece of ass  Obviously  She is gorgeous  So Nick Lachey  Yeah  Is right next to your wife  So they  Take the picture  You're in the same picture  But they crop you out  To make it a better story  Absolutely 
[02:53:30]  So you're part of that whole thing  Jesus  It's amazing  I feel bad for him  I mean  Unfortunately  In Hollywood  You know  The celebs out there in LA  They have to play into that scene  And go out and be seen  And take the photos  And take the abuse  To really grow their worth  In their industry  But man  That's a tough world  Those guys  I thought we had it bad  With being at the racetrack  With 150,000 fans at times  But  You know  The fans are awesome  Those camera people  They're out of control  But you're kind of now 
[02:54:00]  Getting into the realm  Of being a celebrity like that  Where people want to know  More about you  They want pictures of you  It's different than  Some of the NASCAR drivers  I mean  You know  Quite frankly  I don't think the press  Really wants to  Know what they're doing  Or get pictures of them  But you're  You're kind of in that thing  Where you're a young guy  You know  And they kind of want to  Make news  Yeah  I mean  It comes with the territory  I've watched Jeff Gordon  Go through some different things 
[02:54:30]  And I'm sure  You know  So far  It's all been  Very positive things for me  And I'm sure  At some point  There'll be something  That I don't want to have  Happen  But you know  It just  It comes with it  And you try to  Walk down the road  And live your life  But at the same time  Look over your shoulder  Every once in a while  And make sure  You're not doing anything stupid  Very good  Do you ever ask  To smell Nick's fingers?  Jesus  Why do I got to be  The hole here?  Opie  Well you know  I mean  A lot of people 
[02:55:00]  Feel sorry for him  Because he's split  With Jessica Simpson  But I'm imagining  He's doing just fine  If not better  If I dare say  Well if he's in your car  Apparently  You know  You're friends with him  I would gather  Yes  Yeah  Okay  So you talk  He's doing well  Is he doing alright?  Yeah he's doing good  I mean  I do have to say  He's a good dude  And he definitely  Loved his wife  And cared for  And it's been tough on him  But now that he has  Worked his way  Through all of those emotions  He's in full force 
[02:55:30]  Living everywhere  In full force  He's out looking  Wow yeah  Geez  Imagine these guys  Just stepping into  A bar atmosphere  Or some kind of  A ski lodge  The girls probably  Just come flying at him  When were you in Aspen?  We were there  From Wednesday  To Wednesday  Of the off weekend  So I've been  I've been away from home  For 35 days  Today's my second day  Back at home  In Charlotte  I'm in my office now  Just signing  A bazillion autographs 
[02:56:00]  That I'm way behind  On my fan mail  So I'm just trying  To catch up on everything  But had a great time  In Aspen snowboarding  There's a big group  Of drivers that went out there  And  Jimmy  Tell me about it  We're just like you  I mean before the show  Anthony and I  Had to sign an autograph  For a fan  Isn't that rough?  Yeah  I was just like  I couldn't believe  We had to actually  Sign one this morning  I remember one day  It was in the tens  Of autographs  Yeah we had about  Ten in a row  We're like oh my god  Will this ever end?  You guys sign  I just tell someone  To put my name on there  And send it out  You guys really think  About that machine  That signs it for you 
[02:56:30]  You know with tens of autographs  And it kind of looks like  A real signature  Right right  You got a MySpace?  You know what  I just shut down  Two or three of them  Where people were imposing  Fake ones  Myself  Don't you hate that?  I actually had a couple  Of fake ones  That I thought were me  And that's the only reason  I made a MySpace  I think MySpace  Is making celebrities  Or you know  I consider myself a celebrity  So I can say that  Celebrities  They're making duplicate pages  So that the real guy  Has to get on there  And make a page 
[02:57:00]  To say  Hey this is really me  That's what I did  That's not a bad thought  There were two fake Anthony's  And I read the bio  Were they doing a good job  Impersonating you  Or a bad job?  Horrid  I believe they had me  As some type of homosexual  Which you know  It's not a bad thing  But it's not true  You don't have to be  Politically correct  To the NASCAR driver  About homosexuality  They don't push that  Big time in NASCAR  This is not part of the fan base  No this is not an LA writer 
[02:57:30]  You're talking to  You're not going to see  Any rainbow decals  On the NASCAR  Rainbow decals  On the fender?  No on the NASCAR  No no no  Alright  I didn't know  You're talking to  You're learning  You're learning  You thought I was  In a bush race  And now you realize  There's no rainbow  That was OP  I don't know  Jimmy you want me  To make believe  I know about NASCAR  I can do that for you  We're brilliant broadcasters  But  Hey I remember  When they switched  Crap over  And it used to be  Grand National  And then they switched it  And made the two series 
[02:58:00]  Different  Back in like  1988  That's cool  I don't know the date  But you're making me  Look bad now  Yeah see  I remember stuff like  I used to watch  The old days of  Earnhardt and Waltrip  Beating the shit  Out of each other  And you know  No offense to you  Kids out there  But that was some  Real racing my friend  Absolutely  But that's  But that's before  That's almost like  Like say  That's like Shaquille  Calling in  And us going  So what about the ABA  Exactly 
[02:58:30]  No you guys  Tearing it up  But he won  Daytona 500  And I was watching  And I'm like  Hey I interviewed  That guy  That was a good day  For us man  It's been an awesome  Start to the season  We've won  Won two  And finished second  In the other one  So I don't know  What happened that day  But you know  We're really trying  To improve  How much luck  Is involved  As opposed to  I mean your crew  Being there for you  Because we all know  When you ask somebody  Why are you winning  Like this  They say well  The crew  And the car's  Running great  And I'm driving  Like better  Than I ever have  How much luck 
[02:59:00]  Is there involved  That something  Just doesn't happen  Man there's a ton  Of variables  In our sport  From luck  To the  You know  You're only as good  As the equipment  And then the equipment  You know  Need the driver  To be in there  Wheeling it  Doing his job  So it  Really is more  Of a team sport  Than people  People  He's still there  Don't worry  Yeah  Where'd he go  He's still there  Wait  But I can't get him  Back  Hello  Here he is  Jimmy sorry about that  There you go  Did you guys lose me  Someone's screwing  With a phone 
[02:59:30]  Beautiful  I'm trying to  Show you run there  Yeah I know  I'm trying to call  My brother  Because he's a huge  NASCAR fan  Our team is awful  Over here  We'd fly  If this was an auto race  If this was a NASCAR race  We would be flying  Out of the pits  And you'd see all four tires  Come flying off the car  Falling off  Yeah  And no one would want  To take the blame for it  But when they do wear a car  They concentrate on the wrong shit  Like you pull into the pit  And stupid Eric  Would get out the brushes  And try to wash it  Fucking  That would be  Rifling through the glove compartment  Looking for his package  A lot of times 
[03:00:00]  It is a team effort  Every one of your teams  And stuff  But is there something  That has ever happened  During your career  Where you can definitely  Blame it on one guy  The reason you didn't win  Yeah if somebody crashes you  No I mean like  What your team  An equipment failure  Somebody didn't put  A hose clamp on right  Or something  And you go  You son of a bitch  You know I  I can't say  In my cup career  That I've had  A mechanical failure  Really?  Yeah  Some team  We've had some different 
[03:00:30]  Different things  That broke  And there were  Experimental parts  That we knew  Had the potential  Of breaking  But we were willing  To risk it  But I've never had  Just something random  Or stupid  Fall off one of my race cars  You know you just  Jinxed yourself  Yeah thank you  Knocking on wood now  Sorry man  You gotta keep knocking  Let's go to Greg  Let's go to Greg in California  He's got a question for you  Greg  Yeah  You're on with Jimmy Johnson  Hey good morning Jimmy  Hey buddy  Glad to hear you're on the radio  With ONA  But ONA  ONA is missing  One of the biggest things here 
[03:01:00]  Nobody has started off  The NASCAR year  With a shotgun start  Like you've had this year  How does it feel  To be  Standing right now  In a position  Where you can break  All records  I mean you've passed  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  With what he  Has accomplished  You are gaining  On Tony Stewart  And in a short amount  Of time  You have never finished  Out of the points  NASCAR with  Cup points  Nextel Cup points  Out of the top five  Yet  I appreciate it 
[03:01:30]  It's been  It's been  First of all  A kick ass career  Great start to the season  I really don't  Look back  Or look at the stats  I just  You know over the off season  I think I reflect  A little bit  But I'm really going  To save the reflecting  For when I'm old  And wrinkly  And sitting there  On the couch  Telling my grandkids  How good I really was  But until then  I'm just chasing  Trophies  Chasing trophies down  And it's been a lot  Of fun  We've got  A great car  We've learned a lot  Over the off season  And we're just  You know we're 
[03:02:00]  Hitting our stride  And hopefully we can  Maintain it over the whole season  We've been off to fast starts  In other seasons  And just didn't close  The deal at the end of the year  And that's really  What we're focusing on  This year  It's like you've been  Shot out of a cannon  This year  Thank you  What a start you've got  Thank you  One last question  Yes  You pluck your eyebrows  They're always too perfect  Too perfect  You got them  Perfect eyebrows  I look like caterpillars  Parked on my head  I don't pluck them  I break out the chainsaw  And carve on  I got the same problem  I got one brow  From ear to ear  Listen there's not 
[03:02:30]  There's not as many  Jimmy Johnson haters out here  I'm not a  I'm not a total  100% Jimmy Johnson fan  But I'm with you  And you're gaining my respect  But you know what  There's not that many  There's not haters out here  Like you say  So keep up  No I appreciate it  We went through  Went through a tough time  With Chad's suspension  And then the restrictor plate races  That took place last year  I caused a wreck  And one of them  Was blamed for two other wrecks  And I took a lot of heat  So I was  I was speaking to those people  And it felt pretty good 
[03:03:00]  To be there  In victory lane  At Daytona  Saying hey haters  Look where I am  Look what's happened  But I also do recognize  That I have a big fan base  And then also  Other fans that respect  What I do on the racetrack  And all I really care about  At the end of the day  Is the respect  They don't have to buy my shirts  They don't have to be  A full 48 fan  But you know  Just a little respect  That's all I'm asking for  Alright let's go to Andy in Ohio  Andy  Hey what's up man  You're on with Jimmy Johnson  Hey Jimmy how are you  Hey good I'm right  Good man  Hey Sunday's race man 
[03:03:30]  Kansas  Kansas led the most  Last of the race  You led the most important one  The last one  If it was the other way around  And Kansas was trying  To pass you  Was there any  Would there have been  Any foul play going on  You think  Man I lost one  To Carl Edwards  At Atlanta  Last year  The same way  And I did everything  That I could  I was on the lower line  Felt like I was going  To beat him back  To the start finish line  And didn't do it  So I feel for Matt 
[03:04:00]  He's a great driver  We had a very clean  Hard race  And I've been there  Before so I feel  His pain  And I think  He will  In the future  Protect the outside  A little bit more  Which is what I've  Learned to do  In that situation  And I've won two  Now like that  I beat Bobby Labonte  It's the Coke 600  Doing that  And then just won  This one the other day  Very good  Billy Mack has a question  Billy  Jimmy how are you  Doing everybody  Tired man  I'm right  Jimmy congratulations  I was at Daytona  You ran a nice race  There under the conditions 
[03:04:30]  The weather was pretty crappy  But the way this season  Is starting off  With these extra laps  Towards the end  There obviously  How does that affect  The set up for you guys  The last couple of laps  With gas and everything else  It really just depends  On that particular run  We don't  The only thing we plan on  Is the fuel mileage  Making sure that there's  Enough fuel in the car  For green white checkered  After that  There's a couple things  You can do inside the car  We have tire blowers  That blow on the bead  Of the front tires  And also on the brakes  On the front and rear tires 
[03:05:00]  I should say  So what I was doing  I was already a little loose  On that run  And I didn't want  My front tires  To have too much grip  For a two lap shootout  So I shut my fans off  To let the heat  Stay in the tires  To try to keep the balance  A little better  And off I went  Billy  Yeah  That answer your question  It sure does guys  Thanks a lot  All you're thinking is  You know  What are they doing  Turn left  Turn left  Turn left  Exactly  Yeah  And this guy's  Yeah I better turn off 
[03:05:30]  The fans on my tires  So my tires heat up  Jimmy  When you're in the lead  Are you ever tempted  To just kind of  I don't know  Throw things out the window  You know  Maybe a few nails  Or  Golf balls  Just to make it  A little interesting  Maybe  It would make it interesting  Maybe a banana peel  So the car spins around  In circles  Like it did in cartoons  No  You're a little busy  In there  I know  It looks boring  Looks like we're  Going in circles  But  Has that ever  Happened  Gliding a car  At 200 miles an hour 
[03:06:00]  Is quite an interesting job  I used to hate that  Because I would do  The same thing  I tried to go slow now  But when I had my last Saturn  You should have seen me  Zipping down the turnpike  Sometimes I'd hit 58  60 miles an hour  People didn't know what to do  Man be careful  What an ass  You know  We really don't know much  About NASCAR  We're not going to try to fake it  But are there any stories  Out there like that  Like what's the craziest thing  You heard ever happen  During a race  You know  One thing  You mentioned stuff  Falling  Throwing out the windows  Or  Falling off the cars 
[03:06:30]  I know that  Jimmy Spencer  I believe it was  Needed a caution  A few years ago  Maybe it was  Five or six years ago  And there's a piece  Of roll bar padding  We have roll bar padding  To keep our arms  From smacking the tubes  Inside the cockpit area  And he pulled a piece off  And threw it out the window  And got a caution  In the process  He was about ready  To go a lap down  And he got a caution  Which helped him out  And then I've also heard  Of cars in the old days  You know  You've got to meet  NASCAR didn't have  Such a tight  Tech inspection  And they would only 
[03:07:00]  Wear the cars  Before the event  So all the  Teams were filling  Their race cars  Full of lead shot  And when the car  Would drive off  Under the caution  At the beginning  Of the race  The drivers would  Pull a pin  And it would drop  All the lead shot  Out of the car  And now the car  Was 20 or 30 pounds lighter  That rocks  What's lead shot  How do you do that  Like when you're  Having a shotgun shell  Yeah exactly  Lead shot out of  A shotgun shell  Yeah  Oh that's funny  Well Jimmy  You do a show  On XM  For a half hour  Yes  The guy's busy 
[03:07:30]  I understand  But NASCAR  Is alive and well  On XM  It's XM 144  And you do a show  From 7 to 7.30  On the east coast  East coast time  I should say  Yes  We're having a blast  With it  I have to give you guys  Some props  Radio is much  Much more difficult  Than I ever imagined  Without having a camera  There  There's a lot more  That you have to do  To tell a story  And I'm learning it  Slowly  Having a great time  XM's been a great partner  Yeah  And I'm looking forward  To growing it  You know what it's like 
[03:08:00]  To tell a joke  And have it hit the wall  At about 200 miles an hour  It's not fun  It sounds like this  I guess it would be like  Us trying to get into  A NASCAR  Oh I know  Just a disaster  No we're not really  All you do  With a joke bombs  On a radio  Is you just tough it out  Riding a car  And doing a man's sport  Like that  Your fucking life  Is on the line  We do nothing  Just three zilches  We're wimps Jimmy  I have a question for you  How do you pee in a race car  I know it's like  A question you probably heard  But I piss like  Awful 
[03:08:30]  I can't stop  Do you have to hold it  Or like  I know astronauts  At times will just piss  When they're sitting there  You know I've  I've heard that some drivers  Just let it happen  But I have a pretty good system  Where I've never  Needed to go in the car  Believe me  I've gotten out of the car  And run to the bathroom  But one thing is  We sweat so much  Inside the cars  That if  If you stop drinking  Two or three hours  Before the event  You can't put enough  In your system  To overcome  What you're sweating  Oh wow  That's the key  Very good 
[03:09:00]  Thank you very much  Jimmy thank you  And continue  I hate to ruin your thought  I mean I know you guys  Think a lot of me  And you wanted to have this  Tell me that I pissed myself  Yeah but I heard that  I was surprised  I heard astronauts  Have had to do that  Like when they're  Waiting for a countdown  If there's like  Delay or something  They can't get up  And just piss  So like  You saw that  In the right stuff  Okay  That was from 1962  That was in a movie  Jesus Christ  I think they're doing that now  Well I didn't say  I heard it in astronaut school  Okay I saw it in the movie  So what  I didn't say  I have the inside skinny 
[03:09:30]  That's different  When you're surfing  And you need to warm up  Your wetsuit  I mean I've done it then  But never in the race car  Oh really  Okay  Yeah that's a thing  Shark repellent too  Alright Jimmy  No  Alright nevermind  I live in New York  Where the hell are we going surfing  I am  You know  Yeah exactly  Out east  Nowhere  Out east  I surf the Hudson  The Hudson River  Yeah you just jump  On your surfboard  And you don't move  You just stay on top  Like it's concrete  Yeah  Have you ever seen a shark  Yes  When you were surfing  Not surfing 
[03:10:00]  Scuba diving  I've seen plenty of sharks  Yeah  That's a man's man  Yes  Oh oh oh oh oh  Jimmy Johnson  A man's man  This is not getting  Any better for me  Surfing  Surfing  Alright Jimmy  We'll let you go  Thank you so much  We worked hard  To build up a good reputation  And you guys  Have officially destroyed it  Not at all  We're trying Jimmy  Well we don't feel good  About ourselves  Alright Jimmy Johnson 
[03:10:30]  Everyone  Thank you Jimmy  Bye  Later  There he goes  Surfing  Surfing  Surfing  Surfing  I'm surfing  He's a real  A real  Bad  And there he goes  Jimmy Johnson  That's cool  I was trying to get my brother  On the phone  I think he wimped out  Did he?  He's like the biggest  NASCAR fan ever  So I called FH Riley  To get him on the phone 
[03:11:00]  So I could  You know  Ask a question  That would have made his day  But what was happening  They were just hanging up the phone  Hanging up the phone  Hanging up  Busy day  Nah they knew I was on to him  Oh is that it?  I think he might have panicked  It's too bad  Hey where were we?  You want to do the Keith Orman thing?  Yeah see look  Trying to keep organized  We've been more organized lately  Fucking Scarface was more organized  When he was trying to like get the place together  After he pissed off Sosa  I gotta get organized  He puts the phone back  Gotta get organized 
[03:11:30]  He's doing a fucking  He put the phone back  He's doing a pile of coke  And he puts the phone back  Gotta get organized  Gotta get organized  And he clicks the phone back on  While fucking  80  80 murderers are showing up  With machine guns  He's making sure the phone is  On it's  Fucking earpiece  That is ridiculous  That makes complete sense  Yeah it certainly does  I have to tinkle  No  No  I gotta go  No  Go in your pants like the astronauts do  When they're sitting waiting for liftoff 
[03:12:00]  That really was dumb of me  I remember I saw that  I just wanted to ask you a question  I know  So we got the audio  Where do you want to go with this Ant?  I just want to hear the  O'Reilly thing  The O'Reilly  Chastising his audience  Treating them like infants  Because some guy called up  And I guess mentioned Keith  And he got mad  And started threatening them  With all kinds of legal things  That could not possibly happen  You can say whatever you want on the radio  And it just shows  He's another one of these 
[03:12:30]  Stuffed shirt assholes  O'Reilly  With a big cock and a loofah sponge  Apparently  He's competing with Keith Oberman  Keith's having a lot of fun  With his TV show  And gives it to Bill  On a regular basis  And O'Reilly's not too happy about that  A caller got through  To O'Reilly's radio show yesterday  He insists he used no foul language  That all he did was mention my name  Compliment my show  And ask  Why are you always smearing him Bill?  And the host  Using the dump button  All talk radio shows have 
[03:13:00]  And the seven second delay  Cut him off  We're not certain  What actually got on the air  But this was what was posted  On O'Reilly's website  As the air check  For that part of the show  Orlando, Florida  Mike, go  Hey Bill  I appreciate you taking my call  Sure  I'd like to listen to you  During the day  I think Keith Oberman showed  There you go  Mike is  He's a gone guy  You know we have this  We have your phone numbers  By the way  So if you're listening Mike  We have your phone number  And we're going to turn it over

[03:14:30]  Yeah  They're very scary people  They're really scary  Hello  It's Fox Security  Did you say shit  On the telephone  You know what I picture  With Fox Security  Is any of the movies  That go behind the scenes  At like the movie sets  And stuff  And the security guards  Always chasing people around  In a golf cart  Never catching them  You know  Like that whole thing  Like Pee Wee's Big Adventure  Like Gary Coleman  With a badge  Yeah  Yeah  That type of scene 
[03:15:00]  Things like that  That's kind of the  The security I picture  But they contact  Local authorities  Local authorities  That means in your town  And you will be  And then he's thinking  He goes  I can't say arrested here  Held accountable  Held accountable  Did you call  Mr. O'Reilly  A cunt toads  Yes I did  We thought so  Good day sir  What a baby  He's a fucking baby  Fox Security  Hannity and Combs  Come to your house  With billy clubs

[03:16:00]  Name gets mentioned  I love Keith  Oh is he funny  I watch him on a  Regular basis  I think he's a lot  Of fun  Somebody actually  Called up some people  As Fox Security  Could you imagine  The pests getting  A call back and saying  This is Fox Security  With the Fox people  Thinking they're going  To be getting them  Yeah  And what kind of  Response they would get  I really hope that  Doug out Doug and  Those guys  Oh of course  Have dealt with this  Maybe they have some  Recordings of Fox Security  Call him  I'd love to hear it  Yes yes yes  It's hysterical 
[03:16:30]  Bill O'Reilly's live  From noon to 2pm  On the east coast  1-877-9  No spin  1-877-9  No spin  It's not an attack  Just lob a few  Over the wall  We want to  We want to see  If he loses his mind  Yeah  XM-168 by the way  Let's lob a couple  Of grenades  Over the wall  I'm not a part of this  You think I want  Fox Security  Contacting me  I'm a little  Scared myself 
[03:17:00]  And can we get  Keith Oberman  On the program  That'd be cool  I'd like the guy  A lot  No you didn't  I'm not buying it  See  Stop it  Your acting skills  Are a little  I talked to him  Yesterday  I talked to him  Where are you going  So here's Susan  Philan  Former Connecticut  State Prosecutor  On legality  Of calling a radio  Show and being  A pest  He seems to think  Or wants his  Listeners to think  That if they don't  Cooperate they can  Get into some kind  Of legal trouble  With Fox Security 
[03:17:30]  Joining me now  Former Connecticut  State Prosecutor  Susan Philan  Thanks for your  Time tonight  Having done  Calling  I've done  Calling radio  Off and on  Since 1975  I thought I knew  This thing pretty well  The caller can only  Get into trouble  If he threatens  A violent  Or illegal act  Right  The only person  That's going to  Get in trouble  Here is Bill O'Reilly  He's lost the plot  Entirely  To think that  You can commandeer  Local law enforcement  To be your  Personal henchman  Because you don't  Like something 
[03:18:00]  A caller said  On the air  Is absolutely  Outrageous  And absurd  It's an abuse  Of the media  It's an abuse  Of law enforcement  And he's now  The one engaging  In threatening  Behavior  You can't  Do that  He's crossed  The line  What did the  Caller say  That's obscene  Keith Olbermann  I don't think so  There you go  Even if the guy  Cursed  It's not the guy's  Responsibility  To not curse  It's your responsibility  To not let it  Go out over the air  You can't  It's not  Even the jocks  Like  If a jock  Was on the air 
[03:18:30]  And cursed  The jock  Doesn't get fined  By the FCC  The station does  It's the station's  Responsibility  To keep curses  Off the air  It's certainly  The last person  In the chain  Is the caller  That cursed  You know  You're not  Going to get  In trouble  For that  There's certain  Language  Like I remember  When I was a kid  My grandmother  Had a big falling out  With her friend  Ruth  Ruth  And I didn't know  What happened  And I said  My grandmother  Told me  That they had  An argument  And at the end  Of it  Ruth questioned  Her integrity 
[03:19:00]  And Ruth said  You're full of turkey  You're full of turkey  She said that  Well I looked back  I realized  I was a young lad  Ruth probably said  She was full of shit  But my grandmother  Was protecting me  And said  You're full of turkey  So for years  I never understood  Why they would fight  Over you're full of turkey  My grandmother  Was fucking  My grandmother  Was giving me  A bunch of  Bull turkey  Malarkey  I think  She was giving me  A bunch of bull turkey  Bull turkey  I'd like to kick her  Right in the chicken gizzard 
[03:19:30]  By the way  That's nice talk  We got more audio  The people behind this  Say that one of their  Callers  Spinners  They call themselves  Actually got calls  Today from somebody  Identifying himself  As a former  New York City policeman  Who is now  Director of Fox News  Security  Who advised that  Organizer  That if you call  Anyone too often  In this circumstance  You can be charged  With harassment  Is that  A scare tactic  Or is there anything  To that particular claim  The idea of harassment  I think that's a scare tactic 
[03:20:00]  Because what is too often  If one called and said  Every single day  I love you  I love you  And he likes your message  Is that too often  Is it only too often  When he doesn't like  What you're saying  The harassment here  Is coming  From Bill O'Reilly  To that caller  That caller calling up  And saying your name  On there  How is that harassment  It's a public radio show  He's inviting people  To call in  That person has  A first amendment right  To say your name  On the air  Bill O'Reilly  Doesn't have a first amendment right  To threaten  A visit from law enforcement 
[03:20:30]  As if this person  Committed some kind  Of criminal behavior  He just can't take it  He's a baby  He lost his mind  The trolley off the track line  Love that  Is there some line  You can cross  When you're  When you're being asked  To call into a radio show  To be a participant  Of course  Once first amendment right  Ends where somebody  Else's nose begins  You can say  What you want to say  But you can't use  Threatening behavior  You can't say  I'm going to kill you  If something like that  Is said on the air 
[03:21:00]  That's clearly a threat  That's more than harassment  There can be an on-air stalker  But can you really tell me  That calling into  The Bill O'Reilly show  And using the name  Keith Olbermann  Is harassment  Is stalking  Is crossing the line  Insights violence  Is obscene  Or foul  Or illegal  Her voice should be illegal  And for a host  To threaten  The power of the media  Fox News security force  To call local law enforcement  To knock on your door  And say  Hey buddy  You're in trouble  Because you said  Keith Olbermann's name  On my show  Is patently absurd 
[03:21:30]  And the only one  That's going to get in trouble  On this one  Is Bill O'Reilly  I'll bet you the guy  Something tells me  The guy cursed  The guy probably said  You suck  You're show fucking  The guy probably did curse  But even with that  Tough turkey Bill  He dumped out  Tough turkey Bill  You get on there  And start threatening  With all kinds of legal  Mumbo jumbo  Everyone knows  Bill O'Reilly's a tight ass  Yeah  Stop  He's a real tight ass  You know this is becoming  A very uncomfortable  Work environment  And I'd like to say  That the prop family 
[03:22:00]  Should stop  Or I may take legal action  Shut up  Could Bill O'Reilly  Could Fox News  Be charged with harassment  Of some sort  Well I think  That this has to be investigated  I think if Bill O'Reilly  In fact  Made that threat on the air  And in fact  Followed it up  With someone from Fox Security  And in fact  Local law enforcement  Was called  I think that has to be investigated  Because that is  An abuse  Of Bill O'Reilly's power  And it's an attempt  Literally  To commandeer local law enforcement  To be his personal henchman  So that he can be  The censor  The arbiter 
[03:22:30]  Of what's allowed  To be said on his show  How can it be illegal  How can it be a crime  To say Keith Olbermann  On the Bill O'Reilly show  How great would it be  If Bill O'Reilly  Was arrested  Tried  Convicted  And raped  Wonderful  All in a one hour period  Yep  Alright let's say hi  To Lon in Georgia  Lon  Yeah  What's up  What's going on  Lon  Lunging of mice and men  Thanks for calling the program  Stupid name  What's going on  Nah man  That's a good name  Yeah it is  1910  Lon Chaney  Yes 
[03:23:00]  Yeah  I was wanting to talk about  Keith Olbermann  You know  He was one of the loudest critics  Of the  Of the club  Get Mo shit  You know  About the abuse  Of the prisoners  Down there  You know  He'd be on there  Nearly crying about it  He's a fucking pussy  Alright so he's probably  Is he a liberal  So what  I mean I'm sure  Maybe either way  He's still right about this one  Don't like his politics  You could still think  You know  He's funny  Well  Hell he might be funny  But still  I mean he's just a fucking pussy  Dude 
[03:23:30]  I don't understand  The love for him  You know  Dude because he's  Look politically  Maybe he's repulsive  But so what  The issue here  Is he still has a sense of humor  And O'Reilly's a boo  How come so many people  Base  Their  Relationships  On political  Affiliation  Like  Why do I do it  This guy sees this guy  As just a pussy  And he hates him  And I don't see where  The love comes from  Because of his politics  I could give a shit  If the guy  There are plenty  Of liberal scumbags  Out there  And conservative scumbags 
[03:24:00]  And there is  A couple of liberals  That I find very funny  And don't care about  Their politics  I don't agree with them  At all  But you could still  Find them funny  You can't even  Like find humor  In somebody  That like is a liberal  Yeah sure  I mean I can  Laugh at him  As I'm shooting at him  Huh?  I hope he's a good  Funny liberal  He's not really a liberal  Compared to this guy?  Yeah  Nah he's probably a liberal  I'm not a liberal  Compared to this guy 
[03:24:30]  I'm a liberal  Jesus Christ  I'm a  I don't give a shit guy  Yes sir  Hey add me to your  Friends list  On my face  I've been  I hadn't heard from you  In like three days  I know  I just ran through  All of my messages  Sorry  I had to blow out  36 pages  Of messages  I just had to blow them out  I answered maybe five of them  Because I don't have my computer  Set up  So they've been building up  For a couple of days  But I added all the friends  And I'm not going to have  My computer for a while  So the MySpace thing 
[03:25:00]  Is going to slow down  My brother wants to be  In your top eight  I don't have any humans  In my top eight  I have things  Well when you go back to humans  The clock  A cracker  A shirt  I saw that  But when you go back to humans  He would like you to throw him a bone  And be in your top eight  All right  When I go back to humans  Do me a favor  Excuse me sir  Can you hit that button  For what I almost said  Bill  Please  Out of the way  Thanks  Oh okay  Hey disregard my FU line  Then message in  Ask me  All right  Yeah  You know I moved  I got to set up my computer stuff 
[03:25:30]  All right  Very good  So we'll try to get Keith Oberman  On the show  That'll be cool  One of the things  About these political talkers  On Fox  And on CNN  And things like that  And the  Pundit shows  Colbert  The Colbert Report  Have you seen that  Oh absolutely  It is so god damn funny  Really hysterical show  Completely just mocking  Bill O'Reilly  On a nightly basis  Yeah it mocks  All of those kind of  Types of shows 
[03:26:00]  Where it's not news  It's one guy  His name is the show  And they talk about politics  And he is so  So smarmy  He plays it perfectly  He plays the sarcastic  He's supposed to be  Like a heavy  Hardcore right wing  Conservative  But it's so sarcastic  And he does it perfectly  It is one of the funniest shows  On television right now  He is really a funny guy  Yeah  However it's just so typical  Of Comedy Central  That's what they put on  Nick DiPaolo's pilot  Was supposedly very funny 
[03:26:30]  And didn't get picked up  Really  Of course not  Because it's not  A liberal point of view  I don't care if the listeners  Get mad  That's what Comedy Central  Does always  However Colbert  Is hilarious  The character he portrays  Is perfect for that though  He's got that  Kind of where he almost  Looks reputable  As this newscaster  Like they all do  They put the suit on  And stuff  And you're the part now  You're the guy  My favorite is when  He has guests on  And every other show  They invite the guest on 
[03:27:00]  And the guest comes out  And the audience applause  And the guest bows or waves  And sits down  And they have an interview  His format  The guest is already seated  At a table far away  From his desk  He introduces the guest's name  Stands up  And applauds  And bows himself  As he walks over  Because he is the most  Important person  On the show  And he bows  And thanks the audience  For applauding him  As he sits down  With the guest  That's like Andy Kaufman  Oh it's beautiful  You ever see Andy Kaufman 
[03:27:30]  Mock talk shows  Yeah  Where he's like  Ten feet above  The guest in a desk  He's in a desk  That's ten feet  Off the ground  And the guest is way below  Talking down to him  To show a power position  Perfect  By the way  Why don't we get  Tony Clifton on the show  I have contact information  Yeah we can get Tony on  Sure  I'd love to have him on there  Hey Keith the cop  What's up  Morning gentlemen  Hi Keith  Hey  I'm just going over  The New York State  Penal law  In regards to the  Aggravated harassment section  And when you actually  Read this penal law section  It's pretty much written  For every single fan 
[03:28:00]  Of our show  Oh really  And it says  A person is guilty  Of aggravated harassment  In the second degree  When with intent  To harass  Annoying  Threatening  Or alarm  Another person  He or she  And then it says  Communicates with a person  Anonymously  Otherwise by telephone  Telegraph  Mail  Any other form  In a manner  Likely to cause  Annoyance  Or alarm  Yeah but I don't think  That fits a radio show  That is accepting  And soliciting  Phone calls  From people  That's probably  Private  You know  If you call  A private line  Like you would 
[03:28:30]  Call a radio station  You'd get in trouble  On a daily basis  But if it's a radio station  And a talk show host  I think that's different  Where you're encouraging  People to call the show  Right  You're giving out  The phone number  And everything  I used to make prank calls  Where I'd call somebody  And I'd go  Do you have Prince Albert  In a can  Right  And they'd say  Yes I do  And then what would happen  I would say  I yell  Well then why don't you  Get AIDS  And the ironic thing  Is I did this  When I was 10  And there was no AIDS  I was ahead of my time  Can we save  The Train Kills  Miss Death Texas  For tomorrow  We're going to have to
