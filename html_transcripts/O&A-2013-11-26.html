<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a William Shatner impression before diving into a purported deathbed confession from E. Howard Hunt regarding the JFK assassination, presented by Alex Jones. The hosts played the audio, deeming it vague and rambling, questioning its authenticity and Jones’s motives.  A caller, Lee, offered some context, but provided little clarification.  The discussion then shifted to the documentary "Burn," detailing the dire state of the Detroit Fire Department due to severe underfunding.  Numerous Detroit callers described arson, equipment theft, and the department selling fire poles for money.  The show briefly covered the movie "World's Greatest Dad," focusing on the plot and then transitioned to a discussion of Adam Lanza and the Sandy Hook shooting, criticizing the parents’ perceived failings. A short Adam Lambert clip was played.

The next segment began with criticism of Adam Lambert’s performance as Queen's frontman, describing his style as "too Broadway" and "very gay," preferring singers from "the slums."  Caller Finn passionately defended Almost Queen, a Queen cover band, prompting the hosts to play a shaky video of their performance. The conversation moved to George Michael, then Adam Lanza's mother and the accessibility of her firearms, leading to a heated exchange with caller Brian, who defended her actions and revealed a connection to Lanza's father.  A listener requested Maynard James Keenan's Puscifer covering "Bohemian Rhapsody," which the hosts critiqued.  Upcoming guests Rich and Bonnie Voss, and David Tell, were announced.  A lengthy, vulgar discussion about workplace harassment and the idea of a designated "harassment day" followed.

Rich and Bonnie Voss then joined.  The discussion focused on Rich's tattoos, appearance, and relationship with Bonnie, including anecdotes about his aftershave and intimacy.  Topics ranged from Bonnie's tilted uterus and Rich's perceived agelessness to a home burglary and further discussions of their relationship dynamics, including Rich's tendency to "fuck up" good things.  The segment concluded with more discussion of Rich's tattoos and a story about him cancelling a hot rod event gig due to intimidating bikers.


The following segment focused on podcasts and live podcast events, detailing the hosts', Rich and Bonnie Voss's, experiences at a LA podcast festival.  They discussed their successful live podcast with Andy Kimmer (marriage counselor) and Jake Johansson, comparing recording in their dining room to a live performance.  Future East Coast live podcast events with celebrity guests and a counselor were planned.  Voss discussed his movie, experiencing delays due to legal and clearance issues regarding stand-up routines; he'd invested one-sixth of the budget.  Bonnie participated, frequently expressing frustration or hunger.  Caller Steve from DC shared a funny anecdote about Voss's stand-up. Voss discussed recent gigs at Gotham Comedy Club, including audience restrictions and performance evaluations.  The conversation touched on Voss’s frustrations with Obamacare and high healthcare costs, leading to tangents about Canadian healthcare and political commentary.  Jokes about Voss's lotion, Bonnie's attire, and other comedians punctuated the discussion.  The hosts and guests reminisced about past events and interactions with other comedians, including a humorous anecdote about Voss’s role in *A Bronx Tale*.

The next excerpt began with an anecdote about a club owner's actions, followed by a critique of Colin Quinn’s performance.  Scheduling discussions and guest invitations for the next day, including a road trip with Quinn and "Bobo," were made.  Voss's Gotham Comedy Club show and David Tell's performance at Caroline's were mentioned.  A phone call with Bobo detailed plans for a cross-country road trip with Quinn, highlighting Bobo's lack of a driver's license.  The conversation then covered B&H Photo,  jokes involving Nazis, a host's penis size, personal anecdotes about children and drug use (cocaine and crack), negative experiences with network executives, encounters with Mike Tyson and William Shatner, and experiences at comedy shows and conventions, including the presence of porn stars. The death of a *Family Guy* cartoon dog was also discussed. Crude humor and personal anecdotes dominated.


The final segment began with unintelligible chatter and live reads for MagicJack and Steven Singer Jewelers.  Dave Attell's appearance was brief.  The bulk focused on a post-show discussion with Sam Roberts, featuring Roland (talent booker) discussing upcoming guests (Colin Quinn, Bobo, a magician), and reminiscing about a previous show featuring a giant prosthetic ass.  A caller apologized for worrying about Sam Roberts' health.  Thanksgiving plans were discussed, contrasting Eric's in-laws' opulent lifestyle with others' more modest plans.  John O'Hurley (J. Peterman) was interviewed about his career, including early voice struggles, his Seinfeld role, acquiring J. Peterman, and hosting the National Dog Show. He shared anecdotes and discussed his book, "The Perfect Dog."  Sam Roberts mentioned a potential "SBW" after-show and a possible Kanye West interview.  The segment concluded with a final Steven Singer Jewelers ad.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The European Central Bank legte den Referent. 
[00:00:30]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddamn it.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do it. Good morning everybody. 
[00:01:00]  Goodness gracious.  Hi.  I think we gotta start off with the fact that we got kinda lazy and tired at the end of yesterday's show.  I didn't even discuss this with you before.  No.  And I meant to.  That was Alex Jones on that deathbed confession.  That was...  He made that tape.  What do you mean?  He made that tape.  Cause why isn't that tape anywhere?  Oh, oh, that... 
[00:01:30]  The JFK thing.  That he wanted us to listen to.  First of all, he said it was audio and video.  Right.  I was clock watching around 9.30 yesterday.  Deathbed confession.  It's a radio thing where you start watching the clock.  Clock watch.  I was clock watching.  Got a little lazy.  And then I went home going, wait the fuck a minute here.  We had Alex Jones on.  He was talking about the JFK thing.  He thinks it's a conspiracy.  And then he points us to this deathbed confession from...  Howard Hunt.  Howard Hunt. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  But this thing, no one has ever played really.  It has a life on YouTube.  Uh huh.  But he, Alex Jones, told us that there was audio and video.  Right.  All we saw was, I guess technically it's a video cause it's on YouTube, but it was an  audio clip with some stupid old, old school fucking painting graphic or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't video.  And then I'm thinking to myself, I think that was Alex Jones to keep his shit going.  Uh, that would be, um, hilarious. 
[00:02:30]  Can we go back to that again?  We're going to sort through this a couple of times, so let's just go ahead and roll  it now so that, uh, people can hear it.  This is the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt, proving that there was a JFK conspiracy.  Here you go, the first airing, the first national airing of the testimony of E. Howard Hunt  from January of 2004 about the JFK assassination on Coast to Coast Live.  I heard from Frank that, uh, LVJ had, uh, designated, uh, 
[00:03:00]  I didn't know what Howard Hunt sounded like at the end of his life.  Right.  To, uh, undertake a larger organization.  That just sounds wacky.  Or keeping it totally secret.  You can pause it.  We don't have to replay the whole thing.  Oh my God.  And if it really is, uh, E. Howard Hunt, it's, it's extremely vague.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, if you're going to have a deathbed confession, why wouldn't you just say,  okay, A, B, and C.  Here's what happened.  Here's what happened, right.  In aughts?  Is that him? 
[00:03:30]  Wait, see, this is a different fucking video now.  Wait a minute.  But it's stills.  Stills of him, um, laying in his deathbed, as they say.  All right.  Well, go back to where we were.  But I don't know.  Uh, it didn't sound like Alex.  Yeah.  It was playing on Coast to Coast, which is, uh, what's his name's.  All right.  Maybe it's far-fetched to say it was Alex, but you know.  Okay.  There's the old Art Bell show.  Art Bell.  Yeah, I know.  He's very suspicious about the, uh. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  About this, is what I'm saying.  Because why would you be so vague in your deathbed confession?  Right.  You have nothing to lose at that point.  Yeah.  You know.  Maybe he's a senile and medicated old man.  Well, that's true.  He sounded wacky.  He's shooting off at the mouth.  Push play again.  Cordbear himself was a, uh, rather favorite, uh, member of the, uh, Eastern aristocracy.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Something like that.  Eastern aristocracy.  What?  What?  I've never heard about the Eastern aristocracy.  He just keeps...  Aristocracy.  I almost can't say.  He just keeps going and rambling on and it's, uh.  But then...  Maybe he's heavily medicated.  Or maybe that's how the CIA people talk.  Right.  They have their own language.  Keep going.  On their deathbed, though?  Hunt and Litty.  Right.  Right.  I was a graduate of Yale University and, uh, had, uh, joined the Marine Corps during the 
[00:05:00]  war and lost an eye in the Pacific fighting.  Okay.  All right.  I think that, uh, LBJ settled on, uh, Meyer as a, uh, as an opportunist.  Like, what is he going into?  Just say, yeah.  Right.  LBJ killed Kennedy.  Right.  Ah, I'm on my deathbed.  Oh, LBJ killed him.  Yeah.  I think...  It says, I think that LBJ settled on Meyer as an opportunist.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Wouldn't you just say, LBJ picked...  Right. 
[00:05:30]  Meyer.  You picked this guy to kill him.  Right.  It's so stupid.  All right.  So maybe it's not Alex Jones himself.  Yeah.  But it's still very, uh, very fishy because of the...  Suspect.  Just how it just kind of weaves around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Keep going.  It's not, um, it's not, it's not, it's too vague.  Keep going.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  That's not vague.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  That's not vague.  Nice.  That's not vague.  Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  And of course, could not, uh, number Cord Meyer among, uh, JFK's admirers.  All right.  Quite the contrary.  Yeah.  Cord's wife fucked JFK, so Cord, uh, was happy to kill him for LBJ.  Right.  Right.  There.  Fucking conversation done.  Right.  And then it goes, as for Dave Phillips, I knew him pretty well at one time.  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him. 
[00:06:30]  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him.  I knew him.  He wouldn't be the one time.  Oh.  Where are you going?  I don't know.  I knew him pretty well at one time.  Yeah.  Uh, he worked for me, uh, during the, uh, Guatemala Project.  Oh my George.  He was useful to the agency, uh, in Santiago, Chile, where he was, uh, an American businessman.  American businessman, in any case, his actions, whatever they were, came to the attention of the Santiago station chief. 
[00:07:00]  So grass umbrellas, 99 cents apiece.  Right.  It's the rambling of an old man.  But what does he mean by, in any case, his actions, whatever they were, came to the attention of the Santiago station chief.  And when his resume became known to people in the Western Hemisphere, that's a big area, Western Hemisphere Division. 
[00:07:30]  Is there a Western Hemisphere Division?  Oh, well, we should know about that.  He was brought in to work on Guatemalan operations.  Ah.  That's kind of like all over the road, right?  A long-winded way to say, like, oh, he worked for the agency in Guatemala.  He was well-qualified.  Keep going.  It's almost over.  And when his resume became known to people in the Western Hemisphere Division, he was brought in to work on Guatemalan operations. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Okay.  Spruce and Morales and people of that ilk stayed in apartment houses during preparations for the big event.  Oh, why did he say for the big event?  That would be the JFK assassination. 
[00:08:30]  At this point.  If you're on your deathbed.  Right.  Unless the party thinks, wait a minute, maybe I can spin my health around and I'm going to be all right.  Yeah.  And at that point, then I'm fucked because I wasn't speaking vaguely.  I don't want to spill all the beans here, just in case they come in with a cure.  Right.  Is that what's going on here?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Why would you say the big event and not say to kill Kennedy?  Right.  All right.  Keep going.  Your addresses were very subject to change, so that where a fellow like Morales had been 
[00:09:00]  in one day, you're not necessarily associated with that same address the following day.  But he's already associated with that address, no matter what.  No matter if he was there a week or a day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you saying?  He moved around?  All right.  He moved around a little bit.  Is that what he tried to say in that fucking long-winded nothingness?  How can he have all these details and then no specifics at the end of the day?  That's why I went home going, man, we just didn't do a good job with this tape. 
[00:09:30]  It's a weird tape.  Well, it proves nothing.  Right.  Well, and no one has really played it anywhere.  Because it's nonsense.  Right.  Yeah.  But here, I think he's finally starting to summarize what he's trying to say.  Oh, boy.  Mobile experience.  In short, it was a very mobile experience.  I want to point out at this point that if I had wanted to fictionalize what went on in  Miami and elsewhere during the run-up for the big event, I would have done so. 
[00:10:00]  But I don't want any unreality to tinge this particular story.  Well, who talks like that?  Right.  I don't want any unreality to tinge the story.  It's like, oh, I don't want to make anything up.  Right.  And, you know, taint this fucking...  What is he trying to say there?  They were practicing in Miami or they wanted to take him out in Miami and Chicago, as we've 
[00:10:30]  heard over the years?  No, there's stories about, yeah, Miami and other places.  Right.  Well, the other place would be Chicago.  But I don't want any unreality to tinge this particular story or the information, I should  say.  He's just babbling.  Go ahead.  Information, I should say.  I was a benchwarmer on it, and I had a reputation for honesty.  I think it's essential.  So he's saying he was a benchwarmer for the big event, which is the JFK assassination. 
[00:11:00]  Uh-huh.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Why would he say, okay, my job that day, just in case I was needed, was to do blank.  They had to bring in the left-hander.  Right.  You know?  He just says benchwarmer.  What does that mean?  Yeah, yeah.  And who's he talking to?  Someone pulled a hammy.  Yeah, exactly.  He was there to go in.  You'd think whoever was there recording would be there to keep him on focus.  Of course.  Something.  What are you saying?  Put me in, coach.  You finally got a guy doing a deathbed confession, but he's speaking, you know, vague. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you're not asking follow-up questions like, what does that mean you were a benchwarmer?  What are you telling me right now?  What is the big event?  Just so we have it on record.  Because maybe he's talking about some other nonsense.  Big event.  Some fucking birthday party for his great-granddaughter.  He's probably got everything confused this time.  Oh, he does.  I think it's essential to refocus on what this information that I've been providing you and you alone, by the way. 
[00:12:00]  Consists of what is important in the story is that we've backtracked the chain of command up through Cordmire and laying me on the ground.  The doings at the doorstep of LBK. 
[00:12:30]  Oh.  The doings.  In my opinion, had an almost maniacal urge to become president.  So to kill him?  JFK as he was, in fact, an obstacle to achieving that.  He could have waited for JFK to finish out his term and then undoubtedly a second term. 
[00:13:00]  So that would have put the LBJ at the head of a long list of people who were waiting for some change in the executive branch.  What?  All right.  So what happened that day in Dallas?  Right there.  He fucking took his last breath.  Right.  That's what it sounds like.  It just cuts off.  Yeah.  How about some fucking, you know.  And LBJ never went for a second term.  So if you really want to be president that bad, why would he just give up on that a couple years later? 
[00:13:30]  Hunt's a cunt.  So I just went home going, what the hell did we listen to at the end of the show there?  It was just babble.  You know, and Alex Jones sells it that it completely proves that there was a conspiracy that day.  That's like everything Alex Jones puts out.  Documents, tapes.  It's like this is obviously going to show that Kennedy was assassinated by and or, you know, the World Trade Center was brought down and it's obvious there are this tapes. 
[00:14:00]  And then you listen to it.  It's like, no, it's not obvious.  Let me go to Lee.  He wants to, I guess, translate this for us.  Oh, God.  Lee, go ahead, buddy.  Hey, well, this recording was done by the son.  He was letting his dad talk.  His dad had finally had, he's been trying to get his dad to convince his dad to explain this thing for years. 
[00:14:30]  He finally let his dad on recording.  Yeah, he's already 80 some odd years old.  I don't know if it's necessarily a deaf.  Babbling father like that.  Well, yeah, it's just the way dad talked, apparently.  But anyway, so the guy's explaining it.  And, of course, he's explaining it the way some spook, which he was for years, is explaining it.  He doesn't want to get off into great detail.  There was zero detail.  Yeah, a deathbed confession should be a, you know, a deathbed confession. 
[00:15:00]  I didn't have to grow up with that guy.  I think that goes down as the worst deathbed confession ever.  Yeah, terrible.  He didn't explain anything, Lee.  Well, you need to know the back story a little bit, guys.  I mean, apparently.  You know the back story.  You don't seem to.  You don't have all the details of the thing.  This was presented on Coast to Coast AM with Ian Punnett.  Ian Punnett is the guy you think was calling.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Let's start with this.  What happened that day in Dallas, according to Hunt? 
[00:15:30]  Well, there was people that were drugging through the streets.  Can you imagine that information being stored in that vehicle?  Oh, God.  Right.  Like, that's where, that brain has all the information, but the only way it comes out is through talking like that.  The cartoon voice with the vagary.  Lee, explain it.  All right.  You're making a bit out of it, but it's not.  We're not.  Oh, boy.  Honestly.  Oh, my God.  I mean, sadly, we're not really making a bit out of this. 
[00:16:00]  We're just going back to this tape because it just seemed a little fishy when I went home yesterday, and I was just thinking about it.  It proves nothing.  Yeah, because if you're having a deathbed confession, there's way more details involved.  What did he mean by being a benchwarmer that day in Dallas?  Basically, he was kind of like to provide money and stuff like that for those guys that were doing the hit.  Why didn't you say that, then? 
[00:16:30]  Jesus, Sam.  The guy was 80 fucking years old.  Oh, come on, man.  I hope you're as sane as this guy was when you're 80.  Oh, that's nice of him.  See, that helps the conspiracy people.  Exactly.  See, he was 80-something.  That's why.  It's always an excuse.  I hope you're going to get a lot on YouTube.  I don't know how long that YouTube video was, but this was the whole show.  Too long.  Yeah, way too long.  Three-hour show on Coast to Coast that the son finally, you know, St. John Hunt is the guy's name, I think, came up with this thing. 
[00:17:00]  Well, how about this?  His son is the worst interviewer ever.  That's true.  Even though it's your dad.  Because, okay, if you're dealing with an old man, which you are, someone in their 80s, okay, I'll buy that a little bit.  But there's ways of kind of keeping him on track and asking him to explain a little bit more.  Yeah, simple follow-up.  How about, you know, instead of saying the big event, that throws people off.  Because, like, at the big event, that could be anything that was associated with Kennedy.  I'm sure he had all sorts of scandals and things going on. 
[00:17:30]  So at least go, hey, Dad, what do you mean by the big event?  And he goes, well, the assassination, of course.  I understand.  I understand.  But I think this is the way an 80-year-old guy talks.  I mean, you guys...  Maybe this is all about LBJ.  It was on to the fact that JFK had all these mistresses and they were going to try to, you know, fuck him over that way.  I don't know because he doesn't explain.  No.  Well, anyway, it's probably too long for y'all to get into the whole thing.  But it was a three-hour show that night. 
[00:18:00]  But you can't even explain it.  He's the benchwarmer.  That means he had a few bucks in his pocket.  So here, here, pay your rent at this crazy place before you move on to the next place you can live tomorrow.  As I understand it, he would provide money and support, different types of things.  See, it's all vague shit.  All right.  Unlike his dopey son, what does the support part mean?  Well, I'm not exactly sure.  All right. 
[00:18:30]  Well, see, that makes it easy for you.  If he wouldn't have been so vague, you wouldn't be sure.  There's a three-hour show and you can't pull out one soundbite.  This guy was a benchwarmer.  He provided money and support.  So what is the support part?  Support part are things like logistics, you know?  See, another weird word.  Logistics.  What does that mean?  Moral support.  He was like a cheerleader.  No, what is the logistics of it for him?  Well, I wasn't there, guys. 
[00:19:00]  Was he looking to the left and to the right, making sure no one was watching?  You admit that you were not there.  Maybe he was providing the map.  Maybe he was providing the map.  But you listened to the three-hour show.  Your name's Lee.  You're from Dallas.  Were you there?  Yeah.  Huh?  I listened to your show for four hours.  How much am I going to really get and be able to talk about at the end of the whole day?  Valid point.  But you're kind of making our point today, because you're not really adding much to this  either.  All right.  All right.  Well, take your five-minute YouTube video and have a good time with it. 
[00:19:30]  But I'm just telling you.  All right.  But you're not really.  He's yelling at us.  You're not really helping good old Hunt.  I don't want you to help him or not.  I mean, he did.  He did.  It's hard to help him now.  Right.  Like you say, guys, I wasn't there.  So I don't know.  All right.  Well, you added a lot to it.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Appreciate it.  All right.  Quite exciting.  Ron in Toronto.  Ron.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't.  I don't know what that last guy was saying, but yeah, apparently it was made by his son. 
[00:20:00]  His son has some wacky first name.  Yes, we covered that.  Okay.  It was, I think it was part of like a larger like article that he wrote or something.  Uh, I think that most of it was kept for his writing, uh, as opposed to sort of an audio  thing.  That was, uh, yeah.  Why hear it from the horse's mouth?  Another, just another, another puzzle piece put in.  Wow.  Thank you. 
[00:20:30]  Thank you, sir.  This is like trying to do a puzzle upside down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the pieces are upside down.  Right.  So you can't see the little, like, the little sky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or here's, oh, here's a piece of the tree.  We need to find Rain Man to put this thing together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But this is what I'm trying to say.  It's just ridiculous.  He's trying to say that he left it more for his article.  Right.  Because God, we all know we'd rather read than listen to something.  Of course.  And left it for his article. 
[00:21:00]  When did he plan on doing that?  Where's this article?  Can we read it?  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Eric in Jersey.  Eric.  So, you guys were talking about a great deathbed confession.  Yeah.  You remember the famous Loch Ness Monster picture that, for years, they couldn't figure out  was it real, was it not?  Right.  Sure.  And then, finally, the last guy who was part of it on his deathbed said, hey, guess what?  It was just a model.  Explain the whole thing.  Mystery solved. 
[00:21:30]  Case closed.  That's how you do a deathbed confession.  That's a deathbed confession.  Not, well, during the big events.  Anyway.  I was a bench warmer.  Meaning I was making hot cocoa for the guys.  Well, let's talk about Guatemala.  Mala for a while.  But he's right.  Deathbed confession.  Hey, guess what?  It was a model.  Thank you.  Yeah.  That's all we need to know.  towards the water and see the...  There was some form of creatureistic qualities on the surface of the near glass-like water that... 
[00:22:00]  Oh, right.  We ate potatoes the day before.  The time you could buy potatoes.  You're right.  You get to the point, you dying old fuck.  But then I got tricked again by Alex Jones.  He goes, oh, that's a deathbed confession.  It's all right there.  Of course.  So then he hangs up. 
[00:22:30]  We listen to that.  And then we're just staring at each other like, what the fuck are we listening to?  Let's say hi to Kevin in South Carolina.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, that guy in the deathbed said he was giving logistics and support.  So how come Oswald had to ride a bus then walk back to his house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He sucked at support.  Yeah.  Thanks for the support and logistics.  Bravo, Kevin.  Have a good day, boys.  Yeah, this guy's running for his life, jumping on city buses, paying for a movie ticket. 
[00:23:00]  Shooting cops.  Shooting cops.  He's like, he's got his own GTA game going on.  Yeah, yeah.  But then you got this Hunt guy that's, you know, the support guy.  And...  Where was he?  The movie's playing at the theater at the time.  All right.  Oh, that's a great phone call.  You're right.  Oh.  Oswald, if there was proper support, wouldn't he just be...  Yeah.  Jump in a car or a van.  A black van or something.  That's in the back of the...  Yeah.  You know... 
[00:23:30]  I was driving the black van that Oswald hopped in.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Now you got something.  Tell us more about that.  I heard Oswald.  One word that actually ties it to this whole fucking thing.  But there's Oswald all nervous and sweating, running down the street.  Yeah.  Hoping that someone was going to help him out.  Help him out.  He's shooting cops.  He jumps on a bus.  Buses.  The best he could figure out, because, you know, I guess the support was lagging that  day.  Was I'll sit in this movie theater and hope no one notices. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Hunt was probably taking so long to give him directions to the movie theater afterwards.  Yeah.  Well, I gotta go.  I don't have time.  Now there's a little stationary store catty corner on the block that you'll pass.  All right.  I gotta go.  On the northwest side.  Hunt, I gotta go.  Just committed a horrible crime.  I have to leave.  Right.  Let me say hi to Paul in Jersey.  Paul.  Yes, good morning, ONA.  What's up, Paul? 
[00:24:30]  You know what?  Deathbed professionals.  There's a book that came out, I believe, this past month regarding D.B. Cooper and how  he actually survived.  And on his deathbed, he told his brother-in-law who he really was.  He changed his name.  And it is like, I think it was 20 miles from where he landed.  I bought a house from Holt Field.  The book about it just came out.  Like I said, last week.  Oh, yeah.  You might want to check it out.  Yeah, I would check.  I like that D.B. Cooper story.  Yeah, that's a pretty interesting story.  I'll check that shit out. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, so that's my last name.  I figured that it was.  It interests me anyway.  I don't know if it interests you guys or not.  You sound like the deathbed confession guy, by the way, a little bit.  No one believes deathbed confessions as much as they say.  They go, why wouldn't you have a deathbed confession?  Right.  You know, the guy was quiet the whole time.  Because no one really believes them either.  It's like, ah, well, he was dying.  He'll say anything.  Sure.  So no one really believes him.  Yeah, you have nothing to lose.  There's no accountability.  No.  Well, you've got to hook them up to a lie detector test as they're doing their deathbed confession.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  And then zap them if they're lying. 
[00:25:30]  Right?  That might help.  So, all right, man.  We don't have to, like, dwell.  Dwell on it.  But I was just so bothered by that.  I'm like, man, we just let that sit there.  Yeah.  Although we played it really late.  Yeah, it was late.  We probably should have waited until today.  Have fresh minds.  Our new, fresh, pliable minds.  I like that, though.  He was the support guy.  Yeah.  Good job. 
[00:26:00]  You've got Lee Harvey just out of his mind going, where's all my guys?  Where's the bench warmer?  They told me about the bench warmer.  Where's the bench warmer?  I'm in a movie theater for fuck's sake here.  Help me out.  Running into the theater.  Bench is ice cold.  Yeah, look at me.  I got punched in the eye.  Right.  Some fucking guy's running up shooting me.  You stink.  You're the worst bench warmer ever.  Right.  Exactly.  Got punched in the eye. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Got a fucking gun in my gut.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Damn it.  Piece of shit.  Maybe you could have come off the bench one time during all these crazy events that  happened to me after I did my job properly.  Stop talking to people.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop just rambling on like that.  That's probably why.  Help your man out here.  He probably was the bench warmer, supplying support, and then somebody at Dealey Plaza  asked a simple direction, and he's like, what you gotta do is... 
[00:27:00]  Gunfire, people running.  Now you're going to want to go down two blocks.  All right.  He got distracted.  Yeah, a little distracted.  Yeah, a little bit.  It's like Hunt could get distracted pretty easily.  A little bit.  Yeah.  All right.  Have you seen Burn?  Did you see Burn?  I wanted to see it last night.  I watched it last night.  Yeah.  It's great, right? 
[00:27:30]  It's pretty fucking good.  And they've lost a shitload since then.  Houses and whatnot.  Crazy.  The fires in Detroit are just completely out of hand.  It's a great documentary, yeah, on the Detroit Fire Department and...  Why would you bother?  What they have to go...  That's pretty much what the gist of it was.  Why would you bother?  Because it's...  You're not going to win that battle.  Yeah.  There's no funding for the...  The funding part is astounding.  It's the complete lack of funds. 
[00:28:00]  They have...  Like, you see fire trucks around big cities, and you could tell they know to maintain them  enough to do the job.  Right.  But these things are so busted up.  So fucked up.  They just get...  A lot of times they have to take some of these engines offline, and then another company  has to give them one of their engines, and it just works out where they don't have enough  equipment.  And there's...  The amount of fires is astounding. 
[00:28:30]  How many a week?  Oh, God.  I'm not sure of the actual number.  Do they follow all of them around, or just one department?  One department, primarily, but they show what everybody has to go through.  Everyone else is dealing with.  Yeah, and then they show the chief, the head muckety-muck, that came in from L.A., that  wants to, you know, shake things up.  And he's the guy that said...  Had the let it burn policy.  Okay.  Where they pull up, and if they know it's an abandoned building, and there aren't structures  near it that are in danger, to just let the fucking thing burn, because they don't 
[00:29:00]  want to sacrifice firemen or equipment.  Because those houses, you can't live in them anymore, anyway.  These firemen, though, are kind of like, you know, a lot of these things, we don't know  if there's people inside.  Right.  You know, there's people in these abandoned buildings, so they kind of, you know, they're  firefighters, they want to go in there.  But if someone's living in an abandoned building, I mean...  Well, yeah.  They're going to risk your life to get them out of there?  Exactly.  But that's what they kind of do.  I mean, you've got to kind of make choices as a human being. 
[00:29:30]  I'm like, oh, all right.  How important is that life, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I got kids at home.  They had cameras on these guys while they went into some of these fires.  It's pretty amazing.  Then they showed where a brick wall came down and injured some of the firefighters, and  one guy's paralyzed now, and they show him going through physical therapy.  Was he paralyzed during the making of the documentary?  No, he was paralyzed before that, just before it, I guess, when a brick wall came down. 
[00:30:00]  Horrible.  They had video of that, and the worst part is, like, they show the guy's wife, like,  putting his pants on and shit, and you look at it and go, oh, my God, his wife is so fucking  hot.  Oh, really?  It was ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  So you start thinking, like, oh, he can't.  Oh, the hell this guy's in.  And that's got to play with his mind.  Yes.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Horrible. 
[00:30:30]  And no real solutions here.  It doesn't end with a, you know, a happy ending where they get all the funding and the  fires stop, and it's just a continuing thing.  These fucking poor bastards are working with nothing, with, you know, duct tape and bubble  gum holding their shit together.  Old equipment.  Yeah.  Fires every day.  At one point, they showed a clip where one of the fire engines are going to a fire,  I guess, and smoke starts pouring out of it, and they all get out, and the fucking fire 
[00:31:00]  engine bursts into flames.  It's on film?  Yes.  Oh, that rules.  It's like, this is fucked up.  What are they going to do up there?  I don't know.  It's a disaster.  I guess you just got to let it take its course.  A lot of arson.  And just the abandoned buildings.  They start on fire with anything.  And there's a lot of arson, there's a lot of people burning down their own shit because  their houses aren't worth anything, so they figure they could at least get some insurance  money out of it.  They figured there were 80,000 abandoned buildings in Detroit. 
[00:31:30]  80,000.  And the mayor's plan is to take down 3,000 of those a year.  Jesus.  So it really doesn't, because that's their biggest problem.  The firemen are saying, our biggest problem is the fact that there's all these abandoned  buildings.  You know, they're just left there to burn, and these firefighters are going in there  fighting it, sometimes for no reason, and getting injured.  Where are all the abandoned buildings up there?  I don't know.  It's in the city limits, obviously, but yeah, we did a comedy show up there a few years back, 
[00:32:00]  but we weren't even close to the city city.  Yeah, I don't know Detroit very well, but it's not a good place.  Boy, it's not a good place.  And then they don't even have enough detectives, so they're not even investigating these suspicious  fires.  They don't have the resources.  And everyone knows that, so if you're sitting there in a house, or sitting on a house you  still own, and you know it's worth $1,000, you know.  They showed the new fire, the head of the fire departments, of all the fire departments 
[00:32:30]  in Detroit, all the firehouses, and everything.  He's the muckety-muck.  They brought him in from L.A., and they show him vacuuming his office, because he had  to fire the guy, the janitor, because they just don't have the money to pay the guy that  vacuums.  So there he is, vacuuming his floor in his office.  Why would he leave L.A. to go to Detroit?  I don't know.  They didn't come up with that either.  They didn't bring that up.  Like, why he...  He probably had no choice, because why would you do that?  He was born and raised in Detroit. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, okay.  Because it's a winless situation.  Oh, man.  The shit that you must have to go through and eat.  Did he say how many fires this particular house went to a week?  They did, but...  Was it pretty much a fire every day?  I don't remember.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  At least.  At least.  Wow.  Multiple fires.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just a dismal situation.  Right.  That doesn't look like it's getting any better. 
[00:33:30]  Let me say hi to Gary in Detroit.  Gary.  Gary.  We only have six arson investigators here in Detroit.  Six, huh?  Yep.  Grand Ole 6.  Just thought on the news 10 years ago.  Six.  Six guys trying to figure it all out.  I think they need more.  Yeah, of course.  Just a few.  Or do you let the whole thing just take its course up there?  I don't know.  Taking its course seems to be just like an abandoned city. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  Like where they find, like, Pompeii.  Right.  Where it's just a volcano blew up and killed everyone there.  And you dig through the layers of silt over the years and you say, hey, this used to be a place called Detroit.  Wow.  So weird.  I don't know what to do with it.  We just do our best to forget it exists.  Well, where is all this going down, Gary?  It's all over the city.  The whole city is a disaster.  But if you move out into the boonies, you're all right. 
[00:34:30]  Pretty much.  I live about 10 minutes outside the city.  And it's all fine here.  But you move 10 minutes.  Yeah, it's the city, obviously.  There's just too many buildings.  Not enough people in them.  There's no businesses going on.  And the people that are here, a lot of them are fuck-ups.  Why are you staying there?  I can't afford to move.  Okay.  I think it's too late.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  I don't think there's anything we can do as a country to save Detroit at this point.  No.  Oh, I agree.  They said there was something like 1,500 firefighters back in the 1950s.  And now there's maybe 500, I guess.  Right.  Wow.  And there's 300% more fires.  Oh, my God.  So they're really working with nothing.  Right.  I wonder if the firemen like the fact there's so many fires?  Or what's their whole vibe?  Firemen are a weird bunch of people. 
[00:35:30]  They love fires.  Well, they want to.  So they love their job.  I mean, and they wish they had more resources, obviously.  But I don't think there's anything a fireman loves more than running into a fucking building  that's on fire.  Right.  It's crazy.  It really is a, you can't just be a fireman.  Like, oh, I don't know what I want to be.  And then you're like, well, fireman, I guess I'll be a fireman.  They're all like, they love fire.  They're all in. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, do they love fire.  Are other departments going up to Detroit to train?  No.  It just looks like no one gives them the time of day.  That's unbelievable.  It's like, here, you're a fireman in Detroit.  Go ahead.  Right.  You're on your own.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Chicago.  Tommy.  Tommy.  What's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, so, and you were kind of hitting on two things.  And you were kind of hitting on that wall that collapsed.  Yeah.  Detroit is so fucked up that when that wall collapsed, they didn't have ambulances to send 
[00:36:30]  their own guys to the hospital.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  They were throwing these guys in the fire trucks and in the police cars to get them to the  hospital.  Right.  To get them to the hospital faster because, yeah, the ambulance is just, they're really  broken down.  They don't have enough people to man them.  It's crazy.  Wow.  And they were, uh, they had a story in the, in the news, yeah, uh, probably six or seven  months ago.  So the guys had made like a steak dinner for themselves and they ended up getting a run.  So they drove out on the call. 
[00:37:00]  They came back half an hour later.  Everything on their table was totally gone.  Someone had broken into the firehouse, sold them the steak from the table, the baked potatoes,  the coffee from their little like kiddie.  Motherfuckers.  Unbelievable.  It's a real bad.  When it started to get real bad, they had to end up selling all the fire poles because  they were made a copper to make money to pay for bills for the fire department.  It's a fucking war zone.  It's unbelievable.  It's, it's, I hate to say it's kind of fascinating though. 
[00:37:30]  What's going on up there in Detroit.  I'm watching more and more YouTube videos of Detroit.  And then someone turned me on to another documentary called, uh, Detroit, Detroitopia, I think.  Something like that.  Yeah.  Detropia.  Yeah.  Which just is more of an over overview of, uh, everything that's going on in, uh, Detroit.  And then of course the burn documentary, which you saw and I didn't see yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the last thing.  It's on Netflix.  Everyone's talking about how great it is.  So thank you, Tommy.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Uh, Brian in Detroit, Brian. 
[00:38:00]  Hi.  Uh, we live in Metro Detroit and we have some customers that are firemen.  There's so little funding.  If these guys are married and have three or four kids, they are eligible for bridge card  or food stamps.  Yeah.  One of the guys is saying, if he gets his pay cut, uh, again, um, he can get on food stamps.  Uh, it just seems, uh, like a very dismal situation for those poor bastards.  Right.  Uh, and they know it's just not going to get better anytime soon. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know.  I don't know how you deal with that.  Yeah, there's no, there's no light at the end of the tunnel in Detroit.  Right.  That's for sure.  Oh, is this true too?  Uh, Ant would probably know because he saw it.  Uh, Tony in Detroit, go ahead.  Oh, hey guys.  Morning.  Morning.  Hey, um, yeah, they had a report out a few months ago.  You know, they have, and, uh, firefighters are going out to all these fires and ruster  spots going out.  They come in from the building and their trucks are stripped.  I mean, there's, uh, their axes or pickaxes are gone. 
[00:39:00]  Their chainsaws are gone.  And, you know, so their equipment's being ripped off as they're fighting the fires.  It's just, uh, that's no way to, no way to work.  Right.  People stealing your shit.  All right.  Have a good day, guys.  Thank you.  Remember that guy saying there's only six arson guys?  Uh-huh.  Well, Chris in Detroit has a comment about that.  Go ahead, Chris.  Hey, that last call is full of shit.  Oh, man.  I hate arson investigators up here, boys.  Don't worry about it. 
[00:39:30]  They got it covered.  Oh, that sounds great.  Okay.  Obviously.  So you liked it, huh?  Yeah, it was, uh, it was really good.  And, uh, I guess, uh, Leary is one of the executive producers in Serpico.  Um, it, it had a good, uh, it looked good.  Had a good, like, rock fucking attitude.  Oh, nice.  Some, uh, yeah, good music.  Yeah, it was, uh, it was very well done.  It's on Netflix.  Well done on Netflix.  I like, uh, I watch YouTube videos, too. 
[00:40:00]  Like you were saying, like, if there's a good documentary and you can't find it anywhere but on YouTube.  And then you use that goddamn Apple TV, it's great.  Right.  Puts it right up on your fucking TV screen.  For the most part, now, the videos look pretty good.  Especially if they're in HD.  And you just watch it that way.  Yeah, perfect.  It's not like you just gotta watch it on a little computer screen.  Um, yeah.  So I was watching that.  And then, uh, I watched that Bobcat Goldthwait movie.  It was out a few years back.  Oh.  The, uh.  The World's Greatest Dad.  Oh, no. 
[00:40:30]  I thought you meant the one where the guy and the girl go around shooting everything.  I saw that one, too, a while ago.  What's this one about?  This one's the one with Robin Williams.  And, uh, and the little boy from fucking, um, from Spy Kids.  Okay.  But he's grown up.  He's, like, high school aged.  World's Greatest Dad.  When did this come out?  This was 2009?  Yeah.  It was pretty fucking good.  Another one of these twisted.  I may be young, but I'm not your boy.  I won't pick your cat nor pick up your dishes. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I say.  Someone read poetry in his poetry class.  I don't.  Stay black, y'all.  Anybody else have their haiku?  Magnolia Pictures.  My name is Lance Clayton.  I'm a writer.  But so far, nothing I've written has ever been published.  Ernest Hemingway once said all he wanted to do was write one true sentence.  He also tried to scratch an itch in the back of his head with a shotgun.  Your poetry course is not very popular. 
[00:41:30]  There's poetry, sir.  Does it bother you that I have male friends?  Hmm, not at all.  You just feel sorry for this character.  We're going to do something together tomorrow.  Yeah.  Like, build a rocket?  Sure, if you want to.  That's retarded.  Yeah.  This son's a piece of shit.  If it's 9.30, we can go to a video store and get a movie.  Are you stupid?  I hate watching movies.  Carl's a complex guy. 
[00:42:00]  Put on some music you like, Carl, okay?  No, I hate music.  You hate music?  Yeah.  All music?  You know, the only thing to clear the music are the people who like it.  It's such a...  How's Carl been acting at home?  Are you on your period or something?  Does he seem normal to you?  Oh, yeah.  We're not to dinner tonight with Claire.  What?  No.  If you don't act right at dinner, I'll stab you in the face.  So, what do you like to do, Kyle?  Nothing. 
[00:42:30]  You must like to do something.  No.  You're not conveying the movie much.  Oh, no.  He likes you a lot.  You don't look so good.  Well, I had kind of a rough weekend.  Kyle, you ruined everything.  You just shook up.  They're not kidding when they say that raising a child is the toughest job you'll ever learn.  They sure have kept it a secret.  This movie looks like it sucks.  I know, right? 
[00:43:00]  It does?  And the trailer?  I...  I...  I thought he was a zombie.  I like zombies.  Doesn't even convey...  I don't even know what the movie's about.  Now, we bash trailers a lot for giving away too much.  Sure.  That didn't give away anything.  I have no idea what the movie's about.  Yeah.  I guess, you know, he's got a teenage son.  Yeah.  Not even a dick kid.  Just a teenage son and he's trying his best to, what? 
[00:43:30]  Make him happy?  They didn't convey what an asshole the son is, first of all.  Okay.  He's a complete dickbag.  Okay.  And he's a pervert.  Right.  So he's constantly jacking off and fucking mouthing off to girls and everything.  And he likes to practice autoerotic asphyxiation.  On himself?  Yes.  So he kind of puts a tie around his neck and kind of chokes himself in a chair while he's  watching porn and jerking off.  Well, that wasn't in the trailer.  Exactly.  And everyone hates him in school. 
[00:44:00]  Okay.  Everyone fucking hates him.  He's a dick.  I didn't get that.  Yeah.  Well, then his father comes in and finds him dead.  What?  Yeah.  That kid's dead?  Yeah.  So the father...  They made that look like a light, fun comedy.  It makes it...  The father there makes it look like he hung himself.  Right.  Instead of autoerotic asphyxiation.  All right.  And wrote this very eloquent suicide note.  Okay.  That all the students pick up on and are like, oh my god, he was so deep, we never knew who  he was. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  And start loving this kid.  Right.  Even though he was a fucking asshole that no one liked.  And then they're all like, no, I loved him.  I knew him.  I did...  Then the father writes a journal, a whole journal of this for this kid.  And puts it out and it gets published and everybody thinks he was the greatest kid.  And then the father becomes a writer.  Yes.  Because he got something published.  And then they want him to write a book about his experience as a father.  Right.  So he finally gets this big opportunity.  But he finds it very hard to live with himself because he knows it's all based on bullshit. 
[00:45:00]  That's the fucking movie.  Is there a twist in there?  Yeah, there's a little twist.  I'm not giving away the whole thing.  And by the way, it's a spoiler if you...  But the synopsis of the movie is that.  No, I don't think he gave away too much.  I'd still...  How quick does the son die?  I would still see this film.  The son doesn't die until you realize what a fucking douchebag he is.  Oh, that takes at least a half hour.  It's a little bit.  It's very... 
[00:45:30]  He plays a great asshole fucking son.  But they give it enough time so that you don't feel bad that he's dead.  That's exactly it too.  Like they had to really make him an asshole.  Right.  Where you kind of didn't mind that he was now dead.  And the whole thing of him being a dick, I mean, he had to be a big asshole because all  the students had to start liking him.  And the audience has to be like, you didn't like him.  No one liked him.  He was a fucking asshole.  All right.  And all the like, there's this goth girl that fucking is just like so taken by him. 
[00:46:00]  And the father writes everything about him.  She was like, what music did you listen to?  And he's like, oh, Bruce Hornsby.  Because the father listened to Bruce Hornsby.  And then at one of these memorials, Bruce Hornsby shows up.  Oh, God.  And he plays a song.  It's really Bruce Hornsby.  Yeah, there's nothing better.  Of course you could get Bruce Hornsby.  Of course.  Of course.  The way it is, is many years ago.  Yeah.  I think I could get him for one of my dopey YouTube videos at this point. 
[00:46:30]  The goth girl was Jack Nicholson's daughter, I guess.  Yeah.  She looked pretty good.  With the goth makeup, it's, you know, a little man.  But I think she looks pretty good these days.  Oh, I got two things to watch now.  I got to watch Byrne.  And I got to watch World's Greatest Dad.  That was good.  And how was Robin Williams?  Was he the funny or serious Robin Williams in this film?  He was the serious Robin Williams.  Okay.  Yeah.  A little.  See, that's kind of cute.  A little Hayden Panetieri thing going on there with the squat legs. 
[00:47:00]  She goes goth in the movie?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, okay.  She liked goth in the movie.  All right.  But, yeah, Nicholson put out a pretty nice photo there.  Yeah, yeah.  So that was pretty good.  I like Bobcat's movies.  They're really kind of twisted and weird.  He seems to be pretty clever and pretty intelligent, that guy.  Pretty strange.  He tricked us with all that.  Ah!  Ah!  And it turns out he's a really good writer and a good director. 
[00:47:30]  That and the fucking Police Academy movies.  Yeah.  Right.  You think he's just a cornball, but I guess the guy's a lot deeper than that.  All right.  Very good.  Let me say hi to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hello.  Love the show.  Listen, you guys saw the report came out yesterday about Adam Lambert in Connecticut.  Lanza.  Lanza, yeah.  And the Lambert.  What?  What?  Is he gay?  And, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Well, I don't see anybody mentioning, like, what an asshole his mother and father must have been.  That, I mean, you got this kid hiding in his room for three months sending his mother emails for his Froot Loops.  And she's, like, giving him a gun to connect with him.  Yeah, I completely agree.  She's a big piece of shit.  She was dope.  You know, you got to know your kids. 
[00:48:30]  Well, his father's been hiding.  I haven't seen his face anywhere.  He probably wanted nothing to do with this fucking kid that he had.  Well, the mom absolutely looks like a whack job herself.  I don't know exactly what her deal was.  She's probably got this Norman Bates thing going on.  My boy.  Right.  He's my baby boy, and he's fine.  And she leaves a bunch of fucking guns unlocked with this fucking nut in the house.  And this wasn't one of those nuts where you, wow, we didn't know he was a nut. 
[00:49:00]  He's a nut.  Look at the picture of this kid.  I'm just crazy.  It was talking about the whites of the eyes, right?  Yeah.  And after 10 hours a day playing Call of Duty with fucking AK-47s laying around, what the  do they think is going to happen?  Yeah.  He was also playing Dance Dance Revolution.  Was he really?  Yeah.  And he didn't dance onto someone's head.  No.  They have a video of him playing Dance Dance Revolution.  And the Call of Duty angle is rough, sir, I think.  I think there's a lot of kids that are playing Call of Duty 10 hours a day, and their parents 
[00:49:30]  have guns in the house that they probably could get to.  He had an obsession with mass murder and school shootings and Columbine especially, but he  also had an obsession with mass killings that date back to, like, the 1800s.  He had literature about mass killings and videos.  And the mom should have known all this.  Exactly.  And then maybe, you know, kept a closer look on, a closer eye on the kid and locked the  guns up better. 
[00:50:00]  Institutionalize him.  Lock your fucking guns up.  She didn't lock him up at all, right?  No.  Oh, my God.  Ridiculous.  They were just, yeah, the open vault.  I would have locked up the butter knives.  I'd leave the guns out and put him in the vault.  Because that would have killed him.  Oh, it's great.  This kid got a hold of a gun and came out and shot the pointer all in the head.  I mean.  It's horrible.  He's got to stay on the jail for it.  But, you know, if you talk about bullying and shit, this Adam Lambert, I would have  beat the crap out of him.  Lanza. 
[00:50:30]  He keeps blaming Adam Lambert.  Poor Adam Lambert.  Horrible crimes.  He's just a performer.  There's one crime that Adam Lambert's...  What is Adam Lambert doing?  The crime against God.  Is he now Freddie Mercury?  I think that's...  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  Yeah.  Can we hear him as Freddie Mercury?  Sure.  Thank you, Steve.  Good talking to you.  Thank you.  All right.  Yes.  You know, no one feels like fucking parenting their own fucking children.  No, no, no.  That's the biggest issue in this whole goddamn country. 
[00:51:00]  It's not easy, dude.  You're...  Obviously, it's not easy to be a parent.  It's really a lot of work.  It's hard.  I know.  And I can see...  Open up a can of cat food every morning.  I mean, you joke, but you probably understand slightly.  I gotta feed little Beavis.  And a lot of times, you could...  It's so easy to go, you know what?  I'm gonna just do the pass here.  Instead of, like, maybe sitting down my kid and spending a lot of time explaining shit to him.  Yeah.  I could see where you'd decide to skip a few steps. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  But you can't.  Yeah.  Gotta do your best.  Raise a fucking nut like this.  Fuck.  And even if you do your best, there's no guarantee your kid's not gonna be a fuck-up.  I understand that.  But at least fucking give it the old college try.  She absolutely was delusional as far as her son's mental health goes.  And to leave guns open, unlocked, and unattended like that when you have a lunatic.  And to not be enough part of your son's life to know that he's looking at things that... 
[00:52:00]  You know, put all the pieces together, you fucking dumb bitch.  Well, now she's dead, so...  Well...  Whatever.  That's too bad, isn't it, now?  Yeah, fucker.  Uh, let's hear this.  Oh.  Oh, Las Vegas.  So this is what he was doing before his shooting spree?  No.  Oh, different guy.  This is Adam Lambert. 
[00:52:30]  Brian May finally figured it out.  Good for him.  Yeah, right.  I was so...  Get the band back together.  Dude, I was so sick of interviewing Brian May over the years.  Feeling bad for him.  Yeah.  Great guitarist is sitting there waiting for someone that could take the place of Freddie  Mercury.  He finally figured it out.  I can't believe he gauged it up more than Freddie did.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Freddie would have loved to gauge it up this much.  Time to wish I'd never be born at all. 
[00:53:00]  Oh.  Well, he does have a very strong voice.  It's...  And he's got some range.  It's subtle, though, but he's a little too Broadway-ish.  He's too Broadway.  Yeah.  And I know Freddie Mercury, you know, he could kind of...  Say he's a Broadway type of guy.  It's very show-tune-ish.  But, uh...  He's got his toes in the show-tune world.  Yeah.  The queen stuff.  Winkly toes.  Then, then, then, then. 
[00:53:30]  What?  No?  What's that?  Oh.  What happened?  It's a little medley, I guess, because they don't want to...  Oh.  I like his tough guy act.  Is he the gayest of all the, um...  Gays?  Of all the gays? 
[00:54:00]  Oh, God, no.  I saw one on TV yesterday.  Yeah?  The skater dude.  Holy fuck.  Skater?  Figure skater dude.  Oh, well, yeah.  I don't know.  I think it might be on a kid channel or something, but it's some kind of door of the Explorers  slash ice skating commercial for something.  If someone can help me out, I've got to play it for Anthony now that he's asking.  Wow.  What was that guy's name again?  He wore the fur coats in the Olympics.  Oh.  Wasn't he the one he walked through here like a girl one day?  Johnny Weir.  Johnny Weir. 
[00:54:30]  He's pretty.  Johnny Weir was in here.  Uh, puzzled at which bathroom he is, I think.  And, uh...  Johnny Weir, I said.  Brian May looks like, uh, Jimmy Page, huh?  Yeah, a little.  I'd see this shit.  But he's definitely the gayest American idol.  Gayest American idol.  He outgained Clay Aiken.  He did.  Which is a tough thing to do.  Yeah.  He's got a nice little career he got for himself, though, right? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  This guy's got to be touring now with this, right?  Yeah.  He's a little too Broadway, and he's, uh, very gay.  Oh, yeah.  He's a good front man.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  He's a good front man, though.  He's pulling it off.  Oh, yeah.  I'd see this shit.  And looking back, Freddie Mercury was also extremely gay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's no journey, kid.  Uh, no.  You've got to get your new lead singer from the slums. 
[00:55:30]  They'll work harder for you.  That's it.  Now, what are they playing?  Work for a sandwich.  This is from the iHeartRadio Festival.  I just can't handle it.  Yeah, this is almost...  This is getting very close to, like, a Rock of Ages version of Queen.  That's what I'm saying.  It's just a little too show-tuney.  Which, by the way...  A little Broadway-ish.  Could be the worst thing ever put to film.  Did you see it?  No.  I saw parts of it.  You've got to watch the whole thing through. 
[00:56:00]  Do I?  No.  It is maybe the worst movie ever made.  I didn't even know what was going on.  No.  Tom Cruise is there.  You mean Stacey Jacks.  Ugh.  Stacey Jacks.  Holy shit, was that awful.  Maybe the worst movie ever made.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  We got a request to play Almost Queen.  Oh, yeah?  Cover band of Queen.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Finn in PA.  Finn.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  What's up, man?  Oi.  Hey, we just saw...  Me and my buddy, Mikey, just saw Almost Queen this past summer. 
[00:56:30]  It was fucking phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Here's the problem.  We're going to find a YouTube video, but it's going to be recorded from the back of the room.  Horribly live.  That's why I hate doing this cover band stuff.  Yes.  It's hard to...  Say it.  There you go.  It's a shaky video.  It's a shaky camera from the side.  The condenser mic.  All right, we'll try, though.  Oh, this guy does it all up with a mustache. 
[00:57:00]  It's tough to hear Queen in, like, a bar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like a giant show, not like where you can hear individual people in the audience.  Yeah.  I think he's...  Come on, see it.  I think he pulls it off better than Lambert.  Yeah.  Oh, don't...  No.  No.  Not the audience.  No.  We're paying to see you.  You do this part. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, you can really tell they're great.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  Great job, guys.  Come on.  Middle-aged guy with his shirt open by the drum kit.  Oh, there he goes.  He's pulling it off. 
[00:58:00]  All right, Finn.  Thank you, sir.  Not bad.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  See you guys later.  All right, brother.  And then someone saying George Michael with Queen for the tribute to Freddie Mercury.  Well, George Michael can step in for anybody, of course.  Of course, with Elton John.  Mm-hmm.  Don't let the sun go down on me.  Mm-hmm.  He did a great job there.  Thank you very much.  There's something I'd like to say...  Jesus, do you have to be so flaming to front Queen? 
[00:58:30]  I think you do.  Yeah.  I think a lot of people here this evening...  Ugh.  ...want to pay tributes to Trayvon Martin.  Why?  Not necessary.  Homophobic people.  Oh.  People here are probably taking some small comfort in the fact that though Freddie died  of AIDS...  He's just trying to justify showing his dick at the urinals.  Uh-huh.  God.  Him in the bathroom, public restrooms. 
[00:59:00]  How about you just fucking play a song for everybody?  You ever seen one of these before?  Wow, look how many people are there.  Oh, my God.  Good God.  Is that at Wembley?  Yeah, I think so.  Wembley.  I think that's the only place those fans play.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, God.  He's still talking.  And...  Oh, I was stolen.  You got your food over there?  When did that come in?  Oh, I don't know.  I was in Stole Tactics there.  Oh, I just want to hear a little bit of fucking...  And for your own sakes, please be careful. 
[00:59:30]  He's a minute 30 into the video without singing.  There you go.  It's called Somebody to Love.  To Love.  To Love.  Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, can't have you. 
[01:00:00]  Jesus, that's unbelievable.  You gotta say, that fucker can sing pretty well.  Let him show his dick to whoever he wants.  He's earned that right.  Yes. 
[01:00:30]  Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, can anybody find me?  Somebody, Lord.  Jesus.  Wow. 
[01:01:00]  Except for George Michael.  You can kind of tell why he still kind of had a career after so many times pulling his dick out.  That's a lot of years.  How long ago was that?  I don't know.  I feel like he did a couple times.  That looks like a much younger George Michael.  Oh, this video you made.  Oh, yeah.  He's a little haggard these days.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  All right.  And then finally, we got Josh in Philly.  Josh.  What's going on, buh-buh-boy?  Oh, gosh.  Hold on a minute.  Uh-huh.  Hold on a minute. 
[01:01:30]  Let's go to Brian, New Hampshire.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  The thing I want to say is that there was a special on PBS.  On Frontline, all about Adam Lanza and his mom.  Right.  And it turned out that she actually did every single thing that she could for that kid.  She knew that he had problems.  She took him to several different schools.  Uh-huh.  She tried to get him help everywhere she could.  Uh-huh.  And it seemed like nobody could help him.  So why didn't she lock her guns up? 
[01:02:00]  She did.  No.  She didn't.  As far as I can remember, she did.  But what happened was she was asleep.  And he took her keys and unlocked the safe and took her out.  I don't know.  I've seen...  The firearms...  Go ahead.  I've seen pictures where the safe is opened.  There's guns around.  He had guns in his room.  He has access to his mother's guns.  I don't think she was very careful with those, quite frankly. 
[01:02:30]  I don't remember that he had his own guns.  I remember that he used her guns.  Yeah.  Yeah, we all know he used her guns.  It wasn't like they were locked up and then he took her keys one day and he constantly had access to them.  I don't know that that's...  With all due respect, I'm not sure that that's...  I don't need all due respect, but I did see photos that were newly released of an open gun safe.  Yeah, I do believe he had much too much access to his mother's guns. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Well, the...  We can put that aside for now, but I did want to say that...  That's the big important part.  Is that his mother was delusional.  Well, it's just been a while since I've seen that special, so I don't remember it exactly.  I don't know if what you're saying is a popular opinion of what went down.  Well, I...  He was obviously a very troubled kid. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, he was very troubled, obviously, but when it came time for them to actually...  He and his mom to actually connect on anything, the kid had no interest in anything.  Well, they should have put a GPS on the kid.  Yeah.  And the mom...  He knew where he was the whole fucking time.  Yeah, of course, it's easy to...  You know, in hindsight, it's easy to look at this.  Oh, hindsight.  Yeah.  But, yeah, it was unfortunate that she, that the mom grew up with guns. 
[01:04:00]  They were a part of...  Kind of like that hunter chick you guys were talking about the other day.  Yeah.  With hunting.  But firearms were a part of the mom's life forever, and she would go to the guns.  And she should have fucking known how dangerous it is to have guns around somebody that's fucking unstable, like her son.  Whether they're locked up, whether...  If she had the keys in a place where he could have gotten to them while she's asleep, she's irresponsible as a gun owner, and shouldn't have had that made available to him. 
[01:04:30]  I think it was an incredible responsibility for her to have guns.  Possibly she might have thought about maybe getting rid of the guns.  Yeah, sorry.  Sorry, you have a nutty son.  You've got to fucking put your guns away.  Well, it's like one of those situations where she thought she was doing the right thing by having an actual thing that she connected with her son on. 
[01:05:00]  And that was the one thing.  She was totally into it, and then he got into it, too.  He connected with her on that subject, I'll tell you that.  Right to her fucking skull.  I'm going to go with the...  She was a shitty parent.  Yeah.  What I want to impress upon you guys is that she was...  She tried, and she made a really big mistake, and she paid for it with her life.  Well, unfortunately...  Well, no one gives a fuck about her life, trust me. 
[01:05:30]  It would have been great if he would have shot her and then blown his own head off.  Right, that would have been beautiful.  Two fucking wastes would be gone, but unfortunately he went out and killed a bunch of innocent people.  Fuck her and fuck him, period.  I say fuck him, but I do say that I think you guys should also see that front line special on PBS.  What, were you fucking her or something?  What, were you fucking her?  Do you have a connection to this family, sir?  Do I what?  Do you have a connection to the family?  No, not at all. 
[01:06:00]  All right, hold on a minute.  Hold on, let me go to...  I think it was fucking her.  Pat in Jersey, you're on with Brian in New Hampshire.  Go ahead.  Hey, that kid's fucking full of shit.  It's documented.  Fuck him.  It's actually documented in court papers that that lady was an unfit mother.  Oh.  If you Googled that, that was a big thing when they were looking into her background.  I think that kid was fucking that lady.  I don't know why he's sticking up that.  Well, he's still on the line with you.  Brian, you got a comment?  This guy's saying you were fucking his mom. 
[01:06:30]  You might want to defend yourself, because he's assuming you were fucking her.  Actually, I was fucking her ex-husband.  That's actually the end.  I think you're the other brother in that fucking family, the way you're sticking up for that broad.  In all fairness, it seems like the brother has distanced himself from the whole situation.  Wouldn't you?  Of course.  Of course I would.  It is kind of weird that the brother...  Change my name to Lambert.  Oh my God, you're so fucking boring.  Stop it with the fucking love to the mother. 
[01:07:00]  Ah, fuck.  Hey, real quick, because I can never call when you guys talk about this.  Fucking Building 5 at the World Trade Center fell down because there was a million dollar diesel fuel tank.  Oh my God, with this stuff.  Uh-huh.  I'm just telling you why, when these assholes call up and talk about that shit.  So back to that fucking thing in the broad.  You don't got to sell me.  All right.  All right.  All right, man.  All right, Pat.  Thank you, Brian.  He grows a chance at the society.  Bye.  All right.  And Brian, thank you, sir.  Yeah, watch that special on PBS. 
[01:07:30]  All right, we will.  Watch the mother.  She looks very pretty.  All right.  She's wearing a lovely blue dress.  I just Googled it.  Yeah.  That guy was fucking his mother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just read that.  Yeah.  Google it.  He said the ex-husband.  No one else picked that up?  Uh-huh.  I heard him saying it.  I think he was a little white.  Josh in Philly has a little something.  Loafers.  Let's go to Josh in Philly.  Jesus.  Josh.  It might have been like all that, but Maynard from Poole did a cover of Bohemian Rhapsody with 
[01:08:00]  his band Pussifer, and he actually had-  Pussifer is kind of a cool band.  I only know that one song, really.  Maybe two.  What's the one song they do that everyone likes?  I can't even think of it right now.  Yeah?  Popular?  Yeah, it was popular.  Hmm.  Here's Tool doing Queen.  They're telling the truth.  Well, Pussifer.  I mean Pussifer, right.  Is this the real life? 
[01:08:30]  No way.  Is this just fantasy?  Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.  Oh, the video's creepy.  Hmm.  Check it out on YouTube.  Look up to the skies and see.  And go.  I'm just a poor boy.  I need no sympathy.  Because I'm easy come, easy go. 
[01:09:00]  Little high, little low.  In your willow, the wind blows.  Doesn't really matter.  That's creepy.  The video's creepy.  Iraq, put this on our Facebook page.  Hope you're announcing a Facebook.  They've superimposed their wackily made-up faces on the bodies of a real old movie. 
[01:09:30]  And now I've gone and thrown it all.  But you have a very creepy effect.  Yes, yes.  Or they shoot the whole thing like this.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, you're right.  Oh, oh, oh.  And it needs to be a crime.  Or whatever. 
[01:10:00]  Pussifer.  Pussifer with Maynard.  To make creepy videos.  There's nothing you can really do with this song to kind of make it your own, you know?  So it just ends up a bunch of, there's a bunch of covers that sound good, but.  I don't know.  I think he's doing a great job with this.  Yeah, I think he's doing an amazing job.  It sounds great.  But it sounds like the original, you're saying.  Yeah, and it's.  But it's got a little tool in there, but.  I would like to hear him do it as, you know, tool.  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[01:10:30]  Really fucking tool it up.  Really dark.  Tool it up.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  God, I gotta listen to some tool now.  You like tool as well, right?  Oh, yeah.  I've always been a fan.  Yeah.  I celebrate their entire catalog.  Yeah.  All right, we're gonna take a break.  Who's in today?  I think we got Rich and Bonnie, the Vosses.  The Vosses are coming in nice.  Yes.  Very cool.  And who else is coming in?  Their podcast is still going strong. 
[01:11:00]  I listen to their podcast.  It seems to.  From David Tell.  Oh, David Tell's coming in today, too?  Yeah.  That's right.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Their podcast is on the channel this weekend.  Yeah, their podcast is great.  Ah.  Oh.  Really, I really enjoy their podcast.  Mm-hmm.  So, all righty.  Rich Voss, Bonnie McFarlane, and David Tell.  Stay there.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM. 
[01:11:30]  Let's discuss harassment for a second.  Let's just see it.  You feel it a little bit?  Like, let's just discuss it.  Why can't I harass you?  Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, I can never harass you. 
[01:12:00]  Never.  And I'm not talking about, like, I'm talking just, at the job.  It's unfair that I can't harass you at the workplace.  Like, you're looking how you're looking, and I can't just, a little something that has 
[01:12:30]  to do, like, you've got to be careful just to say, hey, you look beautiful today.  That's how messed up the game is.  I think you should be able to comment on any part of the body that you see.  If you, if you, I'm saying, what's your name?  What's your name?  Jeannie.  Now, Jeannie, no disrespect, but if I work with you, I should be able to walk in and go, 
[01:13:00]  oh, Jeannie, beautiful, uh, titty meat you have.  And, because I see that.  But, whatever the scientific term is, I'm looking at, Mr., a 4.9 grade point average.  What's the, what's the science term for, uh, the titty meat?  What's the actual, and it's not the cleavage.  I mean, the cleavage is the space in the middle. 
[01:13:30]  I'm talking about the meat, the meat, the titty part.  And I'm not being foul, just, you know, whoa.  You know what I'm saying?  Just so I can go through the rest of the day without pretending that I don't see.  Which, which, you understand what I'm saying?  I mean, let's work out a deal.  Don't get me fired. 
[01:14:00]  Having women work with men, right, is like having a grizzly bear work with salmon.  Dipped in honey.  Like, so, now you dip the salmon in the honey, right?  Grizzly bears, and the salmon gets to walk through comfortable with honey and fish, and  good morning, grizzly bears. 
[01:14:30]  And the grizzly bears is like, hey, he can't even, he can't even growl, like, ah, what's  up, fish?  Oh, my God, human resources.  The grizzly bears just did grizzly bears, so, so, so, like, I can't even go, hey, good  morning, good morning, fish, good morning. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, I can't touch it, like, oh, look at that.  Oh, let me just get a little bit of that fish, a little bit.  Get that honey.  Oh, my God.  Fish and honey, man, that's my favorite.  Usually I kill fish and eat them and stuff, but I just wanted to just rub that, rub a little  bit of that.  God damn.  That's oppressive. 
[01:15:30]  Like, you shouldn't even, and there's cameras everywhere.  Yeah, you can't do, like, weird stuff behind the back, like.  Why would it be disrespectful?  I said, what's your name?  Terrell.  If I go, hey, Terrell, we work together.  And I go, Terrell, hey, do me a favor.  Let me know when you're getting up to go to the bathroom so I can sniff you a chair.  That's disrespectful because it's sexual, but that keeps me from being, like, I think, 
[01:16:00]  look, I think there should be a holiday, uh, for lack of a better word, harassment day,  but not, that sounds whatever, but I mean a day where I get to find out, like, because,  and this is why it should be harassment day, because women get to be inappropriate sexually 
[01:16:30]  all the time.  You get to be inappropriate.  And when I say inappropriate, I mean say hello to me too close.  Hi.  Or some weird massage, because you think we're friends, and you, good morning, a little kiss,  and he's just like, oh, oh, boy, oh, boy, boy, boy, boy. 
[01:17:00]  And you think in your head, man, I wonder if I could, I wonder if I, you know.  Well, harassment day allows you to be able to ask all year, I say the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.  And it's, and it's a beautiful day, flowers and everything, you buy a flowers, you're just  real cool, you walk up, you're respectful, you say, hey, how are you? 
[01:17:30]  You know, good afternoon, Terrell, happy harassment day.  And you just, like, say, listen, I was wondering all year if you would suck my dick in the broom pile.  And you'd just be like, no, thank you, I'm not, and you'd be like, I'm, thank you, keep  the flowers, I just thought. 
[01:18:00]  I made a mistake, I thought you was a hoe all year.  I was confused, I thought you was a hoe, but you're not.  The O.P. Anthony Show continues.  Yeah, this one, thanks, Iraq.  We knew this a little while ago.  Puss of her.  I love this song. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Who's singing with him?  Maynard.  Oh, the chick?  Yeah.  I don't know who the chick is.  Is she in the band?  I don't know much about Puss of her.  I just know it's Maynard's side project.  I know this one stinks.  What?  You don't like Maynard?  No, or Puss of her.  Puss of her, oh.  Well, we gotta say hi to Rich and Bonnie.  Rich and Bonnie are here. 
[01:19:00]  They're off to a great start.  Rich and Bonnie.  You're saying her pussy stinks?  No.  What were you saying then?  What?  If it stinks, it means it smells like candy.  Aw.  Wow.  Aw.  Wow.  It's tilted.  If you like black licorice.  It's tilted.  Yeah, it's tilted.  I have a tilted ear.  How a, it's how, oh, a uterus.  Oh, you don't see that.  Is that a real thing?  It's like a fucked up pinball game.  I hate tilts.  Wait, is that a real thing?  A tilted uterus?  And what, what happens? 
[01:19:30]  It's supposed to make it hard to conceive, but I guess that, uh.  Wait, you've heard of the tilted uterus?  Yeah.  Really?  I know a little bit about a lot of things.  Yeah, but what, what does that mean?  It's just like off to the side a little bit.  Yeah, it's tilted.  No, I understand what a tilt is, but.  It's like.  It means, uh, he feels big, this one.  That's what that means.  Huh?  Oh, man.  I don't want to do this.  Tilted.  This was a bad idea. 
[01:20:00]  What?  How were you diagnosed with that?  I just, I just put my finger in and checked it.  Oh, it feels a little tilty.  That's tilty.  That's not quite straight.  A friend of mine and I were comparing our uteruses.  Oh.  I was telling these guys off air that their podcast is one of the best.  Thank you.  I still listen on a regular basis.  I tapped out of a lot of podcasts.  It's because it's a good, uh, original idea.  Because you can't keep up with everybody's.  So, you know.  Yeah, it is an original idea.  It's very different. 
[01:20:30]  We'll have one guy or two guys that are sitting there bullshitting us on the, uh, to have  the married couple air with the, uh, all the foibles.  Right.  We're doing a lot of marriage foibles.  Right.  You want to be our, uh, our counselor at Caroline's?  We're going to do a live show.  Come on, do it.  No, I don't want to do that.  You don't want to do that?  I don't want to be weird, but, Ann, do you want to be?  I would actually do that, I guess.  What's the, uh, what's the gimmick?  Well, it's my wife hates me, but every now and then, like, we bring on a, uh.  Are we supposed to notice your tattoo now? 
[01:21:00]  Is that what you're doing?  Yeah, it's so, please don't.  Oh, God.  Is that what you're doing?  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Is that what you're doing?  No.  Yes.  Bonnie.  Bonnie.  I can't talk about it.  We're trying to talk, and I guess we were off Rich Moss for five seconds, so he decided to break  out his tattoo cream, knowing that we would all have to notice and go, wow, I noticed  you got new tattoos, Rich.  No, I didn't do this at Immortal Inc. in Flemington from Josh.  Uh-huh.  No, we're, uh, the best tattoo place.  Oh, you're the worst.  I know.  I did not.  But, no, he puts cream on all the time. 
[01:21:30]  It's like, he's made me hate cream.  Of course.  Right.  Why are you still putting cream?  They look like they're new.  Oh, they're still new?  The guy that's still chewing that Nicorette gum.  Oh, right.  Why is he putting cream on?  Those things will look like an old World War II sailor's tattoo.  They'll still be rubbing cream into them.  Ah, cream.  I want to make fun, but you look all right with the almost full sleeves.  This is like, it's so gross, but he'll, I don't know what he's been doing.  He looks so good lately. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, wow.  Bonnie.  I don't mean that.  I mean it in an angry way.  He conquered.  Like, it's, let's say on stage, I was like, how did he become the young hot one in our relationship?  Oh, my God.  I signed on to be always, I married someone 52 years older than me so that I could always  be the younger one.  We were looking at old pictures and we said it recently that Rich is the only one that  hasn't fucking aged in our radio crew. 
[01:22:30]  It's like Dorian Gray.  It's creepy.  You started at what, looking like you were 55, 56 and you've stayed that age all the way  through.  It's almost strategic.  Like, you looked like utter shit.  So then you've gotten like, you're able to get better and people go, wow, he looks better.  It's because it started with the ponytail or the fucking, the jerry curl and the teeth  and everything.  You can only look better from that picture.  You're right. 
[01:23:00]  There's only up from there.  There's only an upside.  You don't, you have no idea how much pussy I used to get when I looked like that.  Can I just say something?  That video, is that from that?  Rascals.  Yeah.  Rascals.  My friend and I watched that and we both, it's, it made it clear why there's something,  somebody who looks like that should not have that amount of confidence.  It was called drugs.  There was something crazy about watching that and you would, you know, you're like, oh,  I guess I would.  Wow, Bonnie.  Let me see this. 
[01:23:30]  Go ahead.  I mean, watch this video.  You'll see.  How long is it?  No, don't watch that, please.  It's just a part of it.  Yeah.  It's better than watching you rub lotion into your new tattoos.  Oh.  That looked good.  I gotta say, they looked good.  He's got more confidence in this early thing than he does now.  I saw this, uh, what, you got the chicks on your arm?  Yeah, she's swinging a club.  I saw that one.  And what's the other girl doing?  Holding a club.  She's holding a club.  No, I saw the holding the club one.  Yeah, this one's new.  She's swinging the club.  Do you like golf?  I get to play with chicks.  Two pinup girls. 
[01:24:00]  These are the RMC Huggs' six-year-old daughter.  Oh, go with pinup girls.  Right.  But they're underneath.  They're on his forearms.  Yeah.  I mean, the under.  You don't think I said the message?  When we're fooling around, I'm looking at these two girls.  Oh, God.  Last night I said, do you want to have sex?  What did you say?  What?  I got to get my testosterone checked.  Why?  Because you didn't want to, really?  You're just like, eh.  What's up with the testosterone thing?  I don't know, Dr. Steve. 
[01:24:30]  A lot of people are talking about testosterone.  That's going to be the downfall of humanity.  Dr. Steve told me to get it tested.  I should start selling it.  Yeah.  All right.  I heard you guys talk about that on the podcast.  That's probably what he heard and said, it's easy to get it tested or something.  Yeah.  If you want to fuck, you don't have to get any.  And if you don't want to fuck, you need some.  But what?  Like, would it?  What?  Blue pills help.  I mean, if you get it checked and they fix it.  Does a blue pill help the urge? 
[01:25:00]  Like, do you want to have sex?  Look what I'm saying.  Please.  Oh.  Oh, Bonnie.  She's as pretty as she's ever looked.  Yes.  Oh, that was convincing.  See how he rubbed her face?  Oh, my God.  I know.  He puts look shit on everything but his hands.  I just got scraped.  Oh, my God.  You do have, what are you wearing, a little Artie Lang show hat and a Nike sweaty.  Just rolled out of bed, did you?  I don't think you've ever seen me without a baseball cap. 
[01:25:30]  Really?  Probably me too, right?  You leave before the morning?  Yeah.  We always have the lights out.  Anthony Bourdain loves Bonnie.  I know.  Loves Bonnie.  Is that a problem yet?  What?  It should be.  It's the fact that Anthony Bourdain loves you.  I don't want to talk about how crazy Rich is because I don't want to ruin.  Right.  I don't want Anthony Bourdain to hear it and be like, ah, I better just hang.  Is it a problem yet, Rich?  This is a weird thing.  No, listen.  Because you're a little paranoid. 
[01:26:00]  I met his wife.  She's gorgeous.  Oh, wow.  Let's throw that in.  No, he did the CNN thing in Vegas.  Yeah, it was great.  I'm a big fan of parts I know.  No, I mean, listen, I'm glad that...  It is a great show.  I had to watch all the episodes.  Oh, you didn't watch it before he asked you to do the show?  The live show?  No.  That was like the wrap-up show after the season was over.  Did you see the wrap-up show?  Yeah, she did great.  I know.  Bonnie did great.  And she was with the dude from The Wire.  They were all...  It was all fantastic. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, he was a little too stuffy.  He wasn't off-camera.  He was really fun and nice.  Oh, we found him on.  He's a good guy, but he was a little stuffy for Anthony Bourdain.  I don't know.  Fucking...  What's his name?  Oh, the big guy?  Yeah.  Big black guy.  I always forget.  Listen, I'm happy that a famous, successful guy is fans of Bonnie.  No, loves Bonnie.  Oh, relax.  Loves.  Loves.  He's trying to start some.  Huh?  What?  No.  Right?  You start trying to get him going.  No, no, no. 
[01:27:00]  I don't care anymore.  Let the people see what kind of craziness I have to deal with on the podcast.  I always think of that tile guy that you never really got an answer to.  Yeah.  Always pops in my head.  It's like, that didn't make sense.  See, that's worse than what I did.  That didn't make sense.  Call him out.  That's way worse.  But we're still tries to catch him on, and he's like, hey, remember our neighbor?  What was his name again?  Oh, really?  How would he know the color of the tile?  That's, don't, listen.  That's fucking Columbo shit right there.  Hey, you know what? 
[01:27:30]  I'm going to tell you another one.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  Okay, you got it.  There's a whole, there's a whole.  This is a good one.  Yeah.  Our old door.  Our door to our bedroom.  Right?  I don't want to start a fight with our guy.  Oh, my God.  This is.  This will start the fight.  I can't defend stuff.  I don't know how things happen.  Okay, listen to my theory.  Uh-huh.  And you'll, the door to our bedroom locked had a latch on the inside.  Like, you walk in.  Can I just defend myself with one thing?  We understand latches and how they work. 
[01:28:00]  Okay.  All right.  When a woman says, let's have sex, and her husband says, I got to get my testosterone  checked.  That wasn't.  What is a lady to do?  That was a nice.  That was a nice.  That was a nice.  Okay, so it latched from the inside.  So, I was on, I come home, and the latch is like broken, like somebody was pushing the  door.  So, the only way, okay, you go in, you say you lock the door for some reason.  Maybe you would lock the door because you don't want your kid to walk in.  There's many reasons.  Okay.  But you lock the door.  There's no way.  There's some masturbation going on. 
[01:28:30]  There's no way for one person to lock the door.  For door dolls?  Wait.  There's no way for one person to lock the door.  I masturbate a lot the afternoon.  They get on the other side, and then the lock is broken.  Right.  So, here's the theory.  Somebody's up there.  They get in an argument.  He leaves her.  She locks the door.  An argument about what?  He breaks it.  Let me, you know what I'm saying?  Do you see what I'm, do you understand what I'm saying?  Well, maybe, say what you're saying.  Well, maybe she, uh, I didn't break the door.  I didn't have anything to do this.  But maybe she, hold on.  Maybe she locked the door because she was masturbating. 
[01:29:00]  And then all of a sudden the phone rang where she heard Raina or something, and then ran  quickly to open the door and forgot that she had it locked.  Yeah.  And my hand was slippery, too.  How, uh...  She's not that strong.  How badly was it broken?  Yeah.  And what kind of latch?  Is it a little wimpy latch?  Yes.  Okay, so it's a little wimpy latch.  She just tried to open the fucking door.  I forgot that it was locked.  You can't take the same sides.  That's not a good radio.  We're taking the logic side.  Your Honor.  Your Honor, if I might.  Also, there's, you know... 
[01:29:30]  Do you know how it's broken?  Two teenage girls that are often in her house and a six-year-old.  Well, at that time she was probably more like...  So, do you know how it got broken?  I don't know.  I didn't even know it was broken until he showed it to me.  Oh, so you didn't even pull out?  And Rich, why wouldn't the guy just continue until the latch popped off?  And also...  And he came and opened it.  Stop!  Stop!  I never say stop to him.  Oh, shit.  That's why I let all that go.  Ever since I started looking like this. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, gosh.  Oh, shit!  He shined!  I almost did an over-enter on one of the ties.  Oh, my God.  How long it would take.  Wait, so you're trying to get another woman, I guess.  Huh?  Why are you doing all this shit?  Because I know I'm going to land a TV show showing.  Because I know I'm going to land a TV show showing.  He shaved his hairy abs.  Yeah.  We've been looking at his hairy abs for ten years.  Well, they were shaved a while ago.  And then once I get abs back...  Because...  You always had abs.  Yeah, but...  We've seen them forever.  Not like this. 
[01:30:30]  He's acting like...  What was different?  I don't know.  What?  He's at...  You know, where it's just a matter of time before he convinces me to get a facelift.  And then over-medicates me and drowns me in the hot tub.  Why don't you ask you to do anything like that?  Why don't you tattoo abs on?  And then you don't have to work out as hard.  Thug life.  No, just...  Thug life tats on your...  Tattoo the shading and it looks like you have abs.  He doesn't work out hard.  No?  No.  I lift.  I just don't do cardio.  That's stupid.  Yeah, it's stupid, right?  Well, cardio? 
[01:31:00]  It's good for you.  I mean, for losing weight.  It's good for your heart.  It's good, yeah.  I can't believe you shaved down.  I shaved up here, too.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Shaved down.  I don't mean down.  I should get my testosterone checked.  I shaved some shit.  You gotta...  Is that gay stuff?  Well, clipping and...  No, my hair goes...  You know, all that shit.  But completely shaving like that?  Wow.  That's a commitment.  Yeah, but my hair just keeps growing and growing for whatever fucking reason.  It's too much hair.  It's too...  Yeah?  You know, it's too...  It's just, you know... 
[01:31:30]  Can we see the video from Rascals?  Well, wait.  Didn't you want to hear about the podcast that we're doing live?  No, not yet.  It's stalling.  Eventually we will.  You know what?  I'm not listening to you.  The last thing is not suspicious.  It's not?  Nah.  Get it broke from the inside.  Also, I might say...  No, that means someone's pushing from the outside.  But it could be your daughter or something.  Yeah, I was...  She was three at the time.  No, you have two older daughters.  Why would my older daughter come push the door open?  Maybe they were having a party in your house.  They have friends over all the time.  Oh, man.  That could be anything.  Maybe there was some fucking going on in your bed. 
[01:32:00]  I'm not saying your daughters.  I'm just saying people they would have had all over with them.  I'm just not going to go down that road.  But if they're having a party, then maybe others are using your room.  Dirty friends are fucking in your room.  Shit, yeah.  You don't think they've had a party or two when you guys are out of town?  Oh, when fucking...  We used to have parties at my house.  And every room was fair game.  Your daughters are how old now?  23 and 21.  You don't think they had parties?  This was four or five years ago.  Yeah, when they were in high school. 
[01:32:30]  The perfect time to throw a party.  But even when they're babysitting, Raina's like, oh, there was like six people over and  stuff.  Never.  Yeah.  Never.  Oh, boy.  You're crazy, Rich.  If you don't think your daughters threw some parties while you were there.  There was never evidence of a party in my house ever.  No, except for all the things you think that...  Yeah, yeah.  That's the evidence.  How many times have you thrown parties where there's no evidence because your fucking parent  or your parent's going to kill you?  But also, if I broke the latch, can I just say this?  And I know what kind of person he is. 
[01:33:00]  And this is all the things that he thinks that I do these things.  Wouldn't I fix it?  Like, why would I leave it for him to find?  Because you don't process stuff.  That was a party.  Get out of my dad's room.  Right, right.  Bam, bam, bam.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happened.  I would bet that was a party if you want a real answer.  Well, I feel about that.  We could continue to make you paranoid because that's fun.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I think it might have been a party or a get-together.  What about Anthony Bourdain?  What does he say about her?  He thinks she's very talented.  Oh, that's okay.  He was in here recently. 
[01:33:30]  No joke.  Do you say she's hot?  Oh, come on.  Let's not...  He's a normal person in the business.  I don't know if he's normal.  We don't need to drag him into our marital bullshit.  I bet he doesn't need testosterone.  He's talented.  I don't know if he's normal.  He's got to be packing.  Look how tall he is.  Yeah, he's probably got to be...  Yeah, no, he is packing.  But here's the thing.  I have a tipped uterus.  That's true.  So we can't enjoy the full...  Everything seems big.  I want to see Voss from Rascals.  Have we ever played this clip? 
[01:34:00]  No.  20 years ago.  All right.  Well, this is what Bonnie says she's turned on by this.  Yeah.  So I want to hear this.  It's confidence.  Just a couple jokes.  You don't have to play the whole song.  I know.  But you have to see it.  Look at all those necklaces.  You have to see it.  Rich...  Everyone remembers how awful Rich used to look.  All right.  Let her rip.  They have the visual in their head.  How do you feel, New Jersey?  Oh.  I mean, it sounded like you.  Scary thing happened to me last week.  I had a burglar break in my house.  The scariest man is because I'm home at the time. 
[01:34:30]  I'm laying in bed and a living room window opened.  So that's when I crawled out of my covers.  Burglar climbed through the window.  He's tiptoeing around the house.  Tiptoed in my bedroom.  That's when I pretend to be asleep.  Now, it's tough to pretend you're asleep when you're laying in a puddle of piss, okay?  Good one.  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  Oh, crazy.  Guys, tiptoeing around the room.  That's when I started talking in my sleep.  The money's in the top drawer. 
[01:35:00]  I bought a dog to guard a house.  I bought a St. Bernard.  I like big dogs.  That's a good joke.  I like to get naked and ride around the house going,  Equus, Equus.  Oh, boy.  He thinks that's a good joke.  I like doing sick things.  I brought some culture to it.  I knew Equus.  Equus, Equus, Equus.  That was hard to say.  I'm like, Will.  I had to practice that.  It doesn't sound like you.  Your voice isn't mature. 
[01:35:30]  Do you see what I mean, though?  It's like in between.  He's just like, there's no shame.  He's got his hands on his hips.  Very confident.  He's got a swagger.  There's something about it.  Did the business just knock you down because you don't have that confidence?  On stage?  Are you kidding me?  On stage?  On stage in general, yes.  It's almost like...  Because that's natural.  Yeah, it's just a natural...  That's you.  I know what I'm doing up here.  First of all, let me explain something.  I have confidence.  For a couple years in here, I used to take in this and that.  Now, with your guys declined, I don't put up with any kind of bullshit. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, we're going to remember this when we climb back up, okay?  Oh, boy.  It's happening right around the corner.  This is going to become a media destination.  It was told to us.  And the thing is, too, I'll get tweets or people come up to me after shows, whatever, and go, man, you'd really take a beating in there.  I go, look, why don't we give it back and forth? 
[01:36:30]  Yes.  They don't get...  And two...  You're done.  What happens here?  No other radio station would I let happen to me.  Oh, exactly.  Nowhere in this country.  What are you laughing at?  I don't know.  You're just funny when you defend yourself.  I know.  Who cares?  You're always doing it.  Why are you doing that?  See, that goes back to my point.  What happened to that guy?  That guy would just go, you know what?  Fuck you.  Fuck you, Joe.  Fuck you.  That was fucking 20 years ago. 
[01:37:00]  What are you going to do about it?  You know.  All right.  What are you guys doing for the holiday?  More cream.  Why do you have to keep creaming it?  You just put it on.  Huh?  You just put it on when you walked in.  It just...  It dries up quick.  Yeah, that's what it's supposed to do, though.  He just did it, though.  It just dries off, and then you're fucking...  Are you going for full sleeves now?  Just probably.  Yeah, maybe here.  She keeps telling me to get them.  I keep...  I did last night for the first time. 
[01:37:30]  Wow.  Where else you got tattoos again?  I forget.  Just up my arms.  Mostly up your arms, right?  And I had this one done over at Immortal Inc. in Flemington.  Yeah, that's a little too dark.  That's too...  Well, it's a cover-up.  Yeah, the cover-up.  You're going to have to add a little more to that one.  No.  I love this.  Whoa.  You don't say no.  Huh?  Dope.  Do you have them on your legs or anywhere else?  No.  Why have them where you can't show them?  So it's just your arms?  Yeah.  I'm not doing anywhere else.  Maybe some on my neck and my face, but that's it. 
[01:38:00]  You would look badass with a neck tattoo.  You've got to do it.  No.  Just a little neck right here.  The guy at the tattoo place the other day is like, why don't you put a spider web on  your elbow?  I go, look.  I've never been in jail.  I'm not getting a spider web.  Then he goes, how about skulls?  I'm in my 50s.  I'm not putting skulls on my arm.  I want to put like...  You'll soon enough be one, right?  I want to put like AARP signs or something.  Put a skull.  Why is he obsessed with tattooing your elbows?  It just brings everything together? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  I guess.  Okay.  I don't know.  He said, when you finish it, what are you going to put on your elbow?  Well, they're like anybody.  They want more work.  You know?  They're just always like, hey, I'm about a little hair.  First of all, the guy that does me, Josh, the owner, he doesn't need work.  He's one of the best in New Jersey.  Yeah, but what about the tattoos?  What do you mean?  It's a does-me joke.  Oh.  He's one that...  It's still early.  You don't want to.  You'll get your groove.  I actually like me.  You know, he'll...  See, unlike...  All right, whatever.  He doesn't need to work. 
[01:39:00]  He's, you know, he squeezes me in because I'm a celebrity.  Oh, boy.  He squeezes you in.  How much for that rose tattoo?  What's that?  How much was that one?  For this?  Yeah, it's a relatively big piece on your whole forearm.  He did this and this.  Touched up the purple for $200.  That's pretty cheap.  Wow.  That's cheap, right?  That's a good deal.  Really good deal.  Yeah.  You know, he did this...  He even looks for good deals when you're getting tattoos.  I know, Tats.  What?  Fuck that.  What's that?  It's like the most expensive fucking I'll pay full price. 
[01:39:30]  No, he's got HIV now, but it is very good.  No, he's...  Why are you looking for good deals as far as tattoos go?  You're not looking for good deals.  He's one of the best tattoo guys.  That scares me that it was only $200.  No, no, no, no.  You're lucky it came out well.  No, it would never be that for anybody else.  Well, one, I was going to do a show for him.  What happened?  You know why?  It's because you go, look, I'm going on O&A show.  Oh, no.  And I'm going to mention your place.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the business you're going to get from those guys.  No, first of all, first of all, do you think the people that listen to this are leaving 
[01:40:00]  their basements and having their mom drive them to get tattoos?  It's not going to happen.  Oh, audience members.  He's his only audience, and he trashes them.  I know, right?  He had me.  Okay, he was doing a.  This guy's a hot rod guy.  You would love him.  He's got hot rods and motorcycles.  He's got a hot rod club, right?  Real hot rod guy?  He doesn't like hot rods.  I'm not a hot rod guy.  He doesn't like motorcycles.  I don't like motorcycles.  Well, don't you like those kind of car type things?  No, I like a car type thing. 
[01:40:30]  You know, you get behind the wheel.  You know what I'm talking about?  I like a fast car.  Well, hot rods?  No.  A hot rod is like going to the fucking.  How many people like hot rods?  Going to the car shows and the track and seeing a hot rod, which is the difference between  a hot rod and just a fast car.  Well, anyhow, he has a hot rod club.  He has like 12 acres.  So he does a thing every year.  He takes some testosterone.  You can have one, too.  He has a. 
[01:41:00]  So he's doing his outdoor hot rod, you know, party and.  He has a hot rod party.  Well, you know, an outdoor thing with bands and stuff.  And are they racing hot rods?  No, they don't.  They put them on.  They show them.  They put them on display.  Like a car show.  Gotcha.  Okay.  And there's, you know, thousands of people.  So I said, well, he had bands.  I said, I'll host it, right?  Oh.  And I get there and there's at least a hundred bikers.  I don't want to say what, what, what a motorcycle club. 
[01:41:30]  Uh-huh.  And I'm on stage for maybe 30 seconds.  A very popular one?  Very popular.  Oh, okay.  And I'm on stage for like 30 seconds just to introduce myself.  Uh-huh.  And people walk around drinking.  They got their kids.  And then just, then I'm looking around.  I'm going, I can't do this.  I go, because I'm going to say something.  Uh-huh.  And someone's going to go, I'm going to have to kill him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to have to kill him.  I'm going to have to kill this guy.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Because it wasn't conducive for comedy.  Like, if I was in a club and there was 300 of those bikers in the club, I'd have no problem  doing a show because that's what they were there for.  They weren't there to see this little Jew bag on stage telling his jokes.  All right, I get it.  So what happened?  So I bailed out.  You bailed out.  But he still gives me deals on tattoos because I showed up and, you know, was going to do his  thing.  Do you see what I'm saying?  That's why he gives me deals.  Is Bonnie all right?  His stories.  He's always like, I'm a great storyteller. 
[01:42:30]  You're like, Jesus.  Yeah.  I'm a great storyteller.  He tells people that.  You shouldn't have to tell people that.  Tell people.  I don't know.  I hear it.  I mean, I have to hear it all the time.  You can't tell people you're a great storyteller.  No.  People could say, like, wow, he's a great storyteller, but you can't say it.  You've got to leave that telling people to decide.  It's like picking your own nickname. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  Yeah, you can't do that.  Well, you asked, why do I get deals?  And I told you.  Well, let me tell you a great detail.  And you being a great storyteller, you hit it out of the park.  Well, you like to give details.  He doesn't know what details, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Bonnie, he's going to turn on, because I listen to the podcast a lot, when Rich brags that he's  going to take the blue pill.  I don't understand why you have to call it the blue pill.  But it sounds like he's waiting for you to get extremely excited, because he's going to 
[01:43:30]  take the blue pill.  Yeah, well, it's better than the way that he used to tell me that he wanted sex, which  was to hit me in the side of the head with the gel.  I do it at her once by accident.  I was watching TV.  Really?  Well, I guess we're doing it.  No.  But he likes to just, in the middle of watching something, pull down his pants, and, ooh,  come on.  It's like...  Oh, man.  You've got a good presentation.  You've got to show it off, right, Rich? 
[01:44:00]  But there's no kind of...  Oh, no, no, no.  Nothing alluring about him just pulling his pants down.  Let's fuck.  That's why we need the lube.  Oh, Jesus.  How big was I the other night?  That fucking thing was like a monster.  And I...  I took a pill, and...  We were watching Lock Up.  Oh, that'll do it.  And it was...  And the thing is, you've got to tell him I'm taking a pill, because I'm not going to take 
[01:44:30]  a...  He acts like it's so expensive.  Yeah, like 10 bucks a piece.  Like, if it doesn't happen, he's like, I took a pill!  Yeah, who wants to waste, like, 10 bucks?  It's not the money.  It's just $8.  It's not the money.  It's just that I don't have that many.  It's like, medically, it doesn't do anything to you.  You know, it's fine.  Where are you getting your blue pills from?  From the...  The black market?  Oh, Jesus.  He's got a guy.  He was going to do a gig.  Okay.  And, uh... 
[01:45:00]  He paid him in blue pills.  Another one of those good stories.  Yes, come on.  Tell us.  Yeah.  So...  Ah, Mr. Viagra.  Can you, uh, you know, get hard without the blue pill?  Not with her.  Oh.  I knew that was coming.  Oh.  I'll give myself an assist on that one.  Oh, Bonnie.  You know, I was thinking about this the other day, like, Rich will fuck up everything in  his life.  You know, I mean, if something good happens, he will find a way to just fuck it up. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  But why didn't he do that with me before we got married?  Like, how come he didn't...  Oh, that you...  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck that up.  Yeah.  No, somehow he hung on to that and then ruined my life.  Yeah.  What is it, Rich?  Oh, please.  I turned your life around.  You've never had a BMW.  What year?  Well, she got it.  It was only two years old.  That's pretty impressive.  2008, and she got it in...  How long have you guys been together now?  Ten years.  Oh, I mean, we're eight.  Ten years.  Marriage. 
[01:46:00]  No, nine.  Is it eight or nine?  It's eight.  We celebrate our eight.  I always go with how long I've been with my girl.  She never gets me a present.  Instead of the, uh, how long I've been married to.  Nine years are pretty much a limit.  What's that?  That's a, um, that's like a big...  Nice.  At least with me.  Oh.  It's always like, yeah, my stupid marriage lasted nine years.  Oh, I thought that was your cutoff age.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you deserve to rub some lotion. 
[01:46:30]  Do it, do it.  You deserve it.  That's his tell.  You deserve it.  He's told the joke.  Rub some lotion.  You deserve that.  What do you call, what was I going to say to you?  I don't know.  So many things.  I don't, like, you know.  All right, so what's this podcast about?  I'll help you out.  Well, no.  Instead of watching you trying to figure out what you're going to say.  I can't do it.  I wanted to watch.  What's the Caroline thing?  This weekend, I'm at Gotham.  We're not doing it there. 
[01:47:00]  This weekend.  Gotham?  Yeah.  This weekend?  Both of you guys?  No, just me.  Okay.  Fine.  But one night at Caroline, it's like on the 9th, in January, like, if you listen to this  podcast that we did in L.A., we went to a podcast festival, which was tons, all the  podcasts are awful.  It was kind of, kind of cool.  Was it cool or what?  It was, it was a lot of fun.  Like, Mark Maron's podcast, was there all, like, a lot of the things.  Who got that together?  They do it out on the West Coast.  No, who was the, who organized that to do a podcast festival? 
[01:47:30]  That's a bunch of guys.  That have podcasts.  Yes.  You know, Benson's podcast, there was Dana Gould, there was some big, funny podcasts,  you know, Aisha Tyler, they're all big podcasts on the West Coast, and I guess throughout the  country, because they're always in the top, whatever.  So, there was only two East Coast podcasts, Keith and the Girl from Queens, and us.  Who's Keith and the Girl?  They were, like, the first to do podcasts.  They do it every day.  They do it every day, yeah. 
[01:48:00]  That's a big deal.  They have a studio in Queens.  They're really nice.  Podcasts every day is really stupid.  Why?  Because I like listening to podcasts.  I can't keep up with all of you guys.  Yeah, that's like...  A nice quick hour from all you guys once a week is perfect.  Yeah, but see, someone like them, who were, like, the first, they're like a radio show.  They have their following that listens to them on a, you know, daily basis.  So, we went out there.  We were on the opening night.  We were in one room, but they put us up against Marin in the big room, you know, and we filled 
[01:48:30]  our room.  Do you see what I mean about the details?  Are you kidding?  I'm saying silent just to see the story.  You need a good editor.  What I'm getting to is, so we did the podcast on, and we brought Andy Kimmer on.  He was our counselor.  Is he funny?  He's so...  I heard you guys talking about how funny he is on your podcast.  He's beyond fucking funny.  I don't know if I've ever seen a stand-up.  He seems like he's a dick, though.  No.  Is he a dick?  No, I'm telling you, just...  No, as a person, he's horrible, but he's very... 
[01:49:00]  He's really a nice guy.  He's not even one of these guys that are...  What does Marin say about me, Rock?  Last time Marin was here, Marin talked about him.  Marin loves him.  Who?  Mark Marin.  He's...  I'm telling you.  I'm just asking.  Can you answer it?  Go ahead.  So he came on.  He was our marriage...  No, a lot of people, like, I mean...  It's almost too easy.  People do listen.  So you don't have to say it over and over again.  Our marriage...  He came on as... 
[01:49:30]  I heard you.  I had a question.  You answered it perfectly.  He came on as a marriage counselor.  Okay.  And then Jake Johansson was in the room, so he also came up.  And we did an hour and a half live to a packed house.  And it was probably the most fun doing a podcast you can...  Because, like, when you do a live event and you get to...  You know, as a comic, you want that applause or that laughter because it fuels more, you know, energy and humor.  Or just sitting in our dining room doing it with me and her, it's real fucking tough. 
[01:50:00]  It's not easy because, you know, I got to carry it and she's, you know, doing shit, eating and, you know, whatever.  It's just aggravating.  This is...  You did it on purpose.  I hope that people understand.  We understand when things are at a lull.  We wanted that lull that time.  Caroline.  But, like, he doesn't read it as a lull.  He's in the middle of a horrible story.  He's like, I carry it. 
[01:50:30]  Like, do you think people are going to believe that at this point?  Wow.  It takes you a long time to get to the point.  I get it.  When you do a radio show and then if you do a live event, you go, holy fuck, people do react to this shit.  And you get the energy.  We understand all that.  I said that.  They didn't get it.  The people listening don't know what I'm trying to say.  No, people listening are saying, he's telling a snorry.  So what does that have to do with Caroline?  So you like the feeling of doing your podcast in front of a live audience, so you're going to do it again on the East Coast. 
[01:51:00]  You're going to try to do a more regular thing in half.  I guess celebrity.  Look, look, look, he's the, but, no, don't tell me about this, because you said, what's a podcast festival?  Well, we said we did one in L.A.  Yeah, but then you didn't really answer that either.  It's like Hunt's deathbed confession.  Yes.  So we'll do it live, bring in a counselor, and we're going to start doing a show like that.  A counselor?  A guest celebrity.  Right, a guest celebrity. 
[01:51:30]  And they're supposed to kind of, what?  Yeah, it's a loose question.  You guys kind of talk, and they figure out, hey, this is what you need to do.  The first time we did it, we brought Florentine.  Florentine really acted like a counselor.  And a couple days after we did the podcast, Rich and I were driving, and he was doing something.  I go, remember what Florentine said?  Like he really had good advice.  Oh, that's great.  Time's done tonight.  Come back again next week. 
[01:52:00]  All right, when is the Caroline's thing going down?  You don't have a date?  That's, I think, January 9th.  But this weekend, I'm at Gotham.  Yeah, you said that.  Headlining.  Good.  The real clubs.  Very cool.  Wow.  All right.  It was nice seeing you guys.  I've been kicked out of radio so much.  It's so funny.  Why?  Why are you getting kicked out of radio?  Because they let you go.  Yeah, when they do that, it's like, well, Rich Voss.  Your Honor, I said, hey.  Thank you.  Well, we've got to squeeze everything in in seven minutes or something, right? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  When you get up at like six in the morning, you've got a driver.  They drive you to half an hour from your hotel.  You go in.  They don't know it.  Some know you.  Some don't.  Yeah.  That's got to be the worst when they don't know you.  When they, you know.  Because we enjoy the lulls and stuff.  Last week, I did a live event in Vegas for Tom Bernard's radio show out of Miami.  You love that guy.  Yeah.  Do you know him?  Well, you just, I didn't hear what he said.  Did you say, I love that guy?  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  He's great.  I know.  You've said it.  Yeah.  I've said it.  Thus, why I said you love that guy.  Oh, I thought you said I love that guy.  That was a statement.  Yeah, I played golf with him.  Hey, here's.  Is it a good show?  Yeah, it's a good show.  It's.  Yeah, maybe that'll help.  You can hear the things that they've said.  Oh, sorry.  Don't flinch.  I wouldn't hit you.  You're frail.  You're frail.  You're frail.  I wouldn't hit anybody.  He still has tats.  Yeah, he's thinking you're fucking, like, going to beat him up.  Someone has a problem with you.  Can you put your headphones on? 
[01:53:30]  Let me say hi to Steve in DC.  Steve.  Yes.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Here we go.  Hey, I can relate to Rich, as I'm also a bad storyteller, so you have to bear with me here.  Great.  So, I went to the DC Improv a few years back to see Mr. Moss.  Uh-huh.  And I was taking a young lady on a first date, and she's Vietnamese, and they put us in the  front row, and she started getting a little bit tipsy, and was yelling out, Nam Phat, or 
[01:54:00]  something like that, some guy who had just won last comic standing.  Oh, that fan.  Nam Phat.  They call Nam Phat.  It was two syllables.  Nam Phat.  Was she ordering yogurt, or yelling?  Nam Phat.  Nam Phat.  Whatever happened to that guy, that fan?  So, got everything he deserved in life. 
[01:54:30]  So, Rich, you zoomed in on her pretty quickly, and then asked me if her pussy tasted like sweet  and sour pork.  Oh, nice shit.  That's kind of, I'm sorry, I thought he was calling to attack me.  No.  No, no, no.  You fucked up his night, though.  Not at all.  Because she had to deal with that after you said that.  On the way in, an elderly couple was walking up the steps, and some guy said, I didn't pay  $25 to get insulted the whole night, and I knew I was in for a good night. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, boy.  You know, sometimes they're very temperamental audience members.  Yes, yes.  Sure.  You know, no one's trying to be mean.  You just throw in a dumb line like that, but I'm doing a lot of brilliant, genius stuff  in between.  You know what I mean.  Like what?  Whoa.  Look at...  No, I'm asking.  I'm asking.  Oh, the new bit I wrote about the storm.  What storm?  I just wrote a bit.  Super storm?  Yeah, I'm working on it.  Because you see all these signs when you're driving. 
[01:55:30]  The toll booths that say, New Jersey Stronger Than The Storm.  And I'm going to have to say, Jersey Lost.  I'm going to have to say, The Storm Won That One.  You've seen enough neighborhoods to...  I'm going to say, it's not even a draw.  Right.  Yeah, that's funny, actually.  That's a sound assessment of the situation.  Jersey got his ass kicked.  How arrogant are you that you think you can beat Mother Nature?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:56:00]  That's funny.  Yeah.  At least call it a draw.  Right?  I mean...  I just said, it's not even a draw.  Okay, maybe if you pay attention, okay?  Bonnie wasn't paying.  Damn, I bring her in here.  Fuck it.  It's just...  Oof.  Where's the movie at?  You guys sell the movie?  Don't talk about that.  Yeah, for real.  Oh, no.  No, we have a deal.  No, we have a deal.  And here's...  I'm so sick of talking about it.  I know.  It's been so long.  It's going to come out...  Look at the Scarborough.  It's going to come out...  What?  They're comics. 
[01:56:30]  They're twins.  I know who they are.  They were at the podcast festival.  Yeah, they have a big podcast.  We have a couple of deals on the table.  We're just trying to finish their legal stuff.  Fucking lawyers.  I'm not saying...  I wrote to my lawyer the other day.  I said, I write to you.  You'll say you'll get back to me the next day, and I don't hear from you.  Right?  I just...  We have to get this legal done.  Say, hey, brother, I'm with the tribe, too, here, motherfucker.  Help us out.  And so he goes...  I didn't know you could...  He goes, I'll call you to... 
[01:57:00]  Invoke Jew...  Jewism.  You can.  You can.  Pull the...  Play the Jew card.  So I emailed him.  I said, we...  You say you'll get back to us the next...  You know...  You know...  After that email, he goes, all right, I'll get a hold of you tomorrow.  No.  Nothing.  But he's good.  They're good.  Just finish the legal, and it's done.  It's sold.  All right.  It's sold.  What's the problem?  That's good news.  Legal.  Huh?  What's the legal problem?  We have all the releases.  We got to get the clearances for the stand-up in it.  Oh. 
[01:57:30]  The clearances.  That's all.  And we have permission.  We just have to pay it, and it's a complicated system.  Ah, so you're negotiating, though, how much you want to pay.  Gotcha.  We would have paid it when we finished.  All right, then.  So let's...  Thank you.  Come on.  And people out there that listen to this show think you financed the whole movie.  I gave you a little taste.  Oh, you bankrolled it.  One-six of the movie.  He did one-six.  What the fuck?  I don't understand why he...  Why would he do that?  What?  He gave a million...  I was a nice guy.  He gave a million...  No, because...  That guy's, like, killing me on it. 
[01:58:00]  No, because he's so consumed with making sure people know that he...  No, no, I get...  Dude, I've never bragged about...  No, no, it's not you.  It's the dumb money.  Giving you guys a cent on the movie.  No one even knows I gave money.  Yes, you do.  You said it, but there's nothing I really have.  But, no, what happened...  When I say let people think it, then, who cares?  But, no, it's not against you.  What is he doing?  Stop.  I know.  It's not against you.  It's people that...  I thought I was very generous.  Richard's dumb movie, that OP finance...  Well, I...  I didn't even think of it as finance.  I do think of it as your dumb movie, but I don't think of it as... 
[01:58:30]  I wasn't thinking about making money off you guys.  No, not you.  I thought it was just a nice thing to do.  Producer credit.  Holy shit.  Yeah, a little credit action.  Producer credit rolls at the end.  They got producer credit.  In the beginning.  The beginning.  And he saw it live with an audience.  It's very funny.  Oh, wow.  It fucking came out very good.  Damn.  Now he's trashing me.  I guess I should have gave you more money.  No, I'm not trashing.  But why did you only give us that amount?  Right.  Just one six.  I mean, one six.  It's a big number, you fuck.  I'm trashing the people. 
[01:59:00]  And I never asked for anything in return.  That proceed.  Oh, see?  He's got to put more lotion on.  For those keeping track.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Voss is lotioning again.  All right.  No, listen.  It's not you.  We're grateful.  You love yourself, don't you?  Look how he caresses his arm.  I know.  He's never touched me like that.  I guarantee you.  Dude, if I put lotion on, it'd be like this.  Slap, slap, slap.  Slap it on.  He's like caressing his arm.  He's rubbing and slowly.  He's doing figure eights and circles.  But now watch him touch me.  Go ahead.  Yeah, that's it. 
[01:59:30]  It's like he's giving me a snake bite.  Why don't you tell everyone how much I gave?  I didn't say how much.  Yeah, but you are.  You said one six.  Yes.  Well, because of the matter.  You're giving too much information.  Who cares?  He loves to tell the number.  No, I don't.  Listen.  Stop.  Can you guys listen?  I gave you more than you guys wanted.  I know.  Oh, wow.  They came to me asking for something.  And I said, all right, well, I can do this instead.  No, we're grateful.  I'm trying to say the perception of people that think.  Who cares, though?  Who cares what Greg and wherever. 
[02:00:00]  I don't even.  Cut some points.  I don't even.  Back end points.  Yeah.  I don't even expect my original investment back.  But that's already, that's already, uh, uh, whatever.  It's all.  Made?  No.  Uh-oh.  One six.  Bonnie showed it in Portland.  What am I, a schmuck on wheels?  Right.  I want my money rich.  Oh, yeah.  Bonnie showed it at Portland.  She did a female comedy festival called All Jane, No Dick.  That was the festival. 
[02:00:30]  Was it really called that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at her.  And that's because.  Bonnie's mad right now.  That's because.  I'm hungry.  He said that you guys would get us food.  Well, we will.  Well, but see, that's what you were supposed to do when you first got here instead of demanding  to come on.  You settle in.  You take your.  She hasn't even taken off her sweatshirt yet.  You get your.  I'm taking off my sweatshirt, buddy.  I don't think she's got anything under it.  You get your breakfast order in and then you come in here nice.  I haven't shaved my stomach. 
[02:01:00]  You shaved.  Your abs aren't shaved like Rich.  Yeah, that's too good.  Why don't we take a break and then we can get you guys some breakfast.  Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.  I ain't paying for shit, by the way.  Fuck you.  You pay for one sixth of our breakfast.  Oh, it's got one of them Bob envelopes where you got to sign a bunch of checks to people  that I don't even know who they are, right?  New York City Department of Finance, $10,463.  Was that tax time?  Is that?  I guess.  What?  They're giving you.  That's a check for you.  No, that's taxes.  That's my.  I just laid out $12,000 for my half year school taxes. 
[02:01:30]  How much?  Oh, my God.  $12,000.  It's $24,000 a year in my neighborhood for school taxes.  Stop dating those girls.  I know, right?  You got to pay.  That's just school.  And then property is separate.  It's amazing out there in Nassau County.  Your fucking taxes have to be.  My brain doesn't even really process that.  It's the highest in the fucking country.  Nassau County is the highest.  And it's not.  Yes.  And that's where I'm in complete agreement with you. 
[02:02:00]  And then they want more from us.  And we're not doing a fair share.  You're not doing your fair share.  Go fuck your mother.  Yeah, I have enough money to pay these bills.  But the amount of money coming from one guy, me, is ridiculous.  You know, the wealthies.  Do your fair share.  I'm doing my fair share.  He says, shove your fucking face in it like a dog that just shit on the rug.  I love hearing wealthy people talk about it.  Now you have knowledge, I understand.  I don't want to get trashed about this Obamacare.  You know, everybody's saying, I'm paying.  Can we wait until after the break?  You know that it's serious when he's reaching out at you. 
[02:02:30]  No, this is a topic.  It's going to take a while.  Why don't we take a break?  Remember this.  Remember that.  It's going to be up to you to remember this, though.  We're not going to remind you.  I don't doubt it.  I can't wait to hear.  Yeah, I want to hear you taking Obamacare for real.  It's killing me.  Oh, no, God.  I might not be able to come back in.  And I think, is David Tell here?  He's on his way.  All right, we've got David Tell today as well.  Thanks.  Very cool show.  Rich and Bonnie are in.  Rich Voss at Gotham this weekend.  This is the O.P. Anthony Show. 
[02:03:00]  Here is XM.  See, told you we had sponsors.  And now, back to the O.P. Anthony Show.  We've got David Tell in the studio.  Rich Voss, Bonnie.  Hey, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Good morning, David Tell.  Rich just told me that there's no better club comic than him. 
[02:03:30]  And I know we're going head-to-head in this battle.  No, that's not what I was getting at.  And I said, don't you have your own podcast?  It's not fair for you to promote here when on podcast list.  Right, you should just be promoting on a podcast.  Yeah, but you're David Tell.  You don't even have to promote.  Just your posts are.  Dude, I'm not even on the show right now.  I'm sitting in the place where they look up stuff.  I'm not on the show.  That's true.  I offered up my chair to you.  No, you guys are a theme.  Where they look up stuff.  This is the, like, this would be, if this is Star Trek, this is like the Spock area. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of off to the side.  Yeah, they're looking in that thing.  Where the weatherman's too busy, so they go right to his office to do his broadcast meteorologist.  You don't need promotion.  You're David Tell.  You're a fucking genius.  Besides me, you're the number one guy of the comic copy.  I just did a USO show with Jay Oakerson, April Macy, and Jesse Joyce, and 40 people showed 
[02:04:30]  up.  So I need a lot of promotion.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it was a great crowd.  It was excellent in Delaware at the Dover Air Force Base, but it was funny.  Yeah, I need promotion.  What happened?  No, no.  It was just, it's holiday times, and like, you know, it's a Monday night, so it's a little  difficult.  But it was a great, great show.  Service guys?  Yes.  And the support of the families.  Isn't this a tough weekend to do comedy?  Yeah.  Thanksgiving?  Not New York.  Or does everyone want to get the fuck out of their house after Thanksgiving?  Well, I don't know.  I'm already selling a lot of tickets at Gotham, so I don't know how he's doing. 
[02:05:00]  But David Tell will be at Caroline's.  You're going to be at Gotham.  But there's a lot of tourists, especially for you.  You're on Broadway.  They're just going to fucking fly in.  You're working both.  They're going to come flying in.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Gotham is, where is that again?  That's in Chelsea.  That's where the Broadway people live.  That's gay Broadway.  Yeah, it is.  Hey, Dave.  You got here just in time.  What happened?  We held Rich Wasp back for the commercials because he's going to give us his take on Obamacare. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Apparently.  Oh, this is why it's killing him.  And we wanted to fucking clear the field.  Apparently it's killing him, as he said.  Well, listen.  Wait, wait.  Before you get started, bodies from Canada, you should jump in on this because they have  health care.  They have that socialized fucking health care.  There's nothing wrong with socialism.  What?  Tell that to your crack, fat mayor.  Huh?  Yeah, exactly.  We all love him.  That's how magical Canada is.  That's how great our health care is.  He's on crack and he's fat. 
[02:06:00]  There you go.  It's a magical world up there.  If you beat off, a woman appears.  It's backwards land.  That's what I call Canada.  Backwards world.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Why has he been so quiet lately in this world, Ford?  What's wrong with him?  He doesn't understand.  He's got the heat right now.  He's got to keep going.  Hey, buddy.  He went away for a bit.  Yeah, do more stupid stuff.  Didn't they take away his...  All his powers.  Now he's just a figurehead.  Yeah, he's just a figurehead.  Yeah, but now he has nothing to lose.  Now he should really start getting wild.  Let her rip.  He should try to be a dictator. 
[02:06:30]  Like Toronto's dictator.  He's so Canadian.  It's so funny to watch.  Like even his sister, she was on, you know, defending him.  And she's like, he's not an alcoholic.  You know, you're going to count binge drinking.  Okay.  Have I had to ask him to leave my house?  Yes.  I've had to ask him to leave my house.  Does he pass out sometimes?  Yes.  He passes out sometimes.  But he's not an alcoholic.  But he's not an alcoholic.  Do the 911 call from...  I don't do things. 
[02:07:00]  Please, come on.  Do it.  Who was the girl that was...  The three girls that were held in the basement for 10 years?  Yeah.  Ariel Castro's chicks.  Yeah, what was the girl's name?  Amanda Berry?  Amanda Berry.  Oh, you do it.  The Amanda Berry.  I love that Amanda Berry.  It's Amanda Berry.  I've been locked up for 10 years.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Where you at, Mandy?  No, you don't understand.  I need someone to get here quick.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:07:30]  I love how she thought people were still looking for her.  Oh, shit.  She had no idea.  That was hilarious.  No one fucking gave her shit.  What did she say?  She goes, you know me.  What happened to you?  You know me?  I'm Amanda Berry.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, shit.  What are you doing?  Where you at, Mandy?  Where you at?  Where you at?  Well, that's terrible.  I think that's a great take on the kind of humor we can expect out of the bosses.  Hurtful, topical.  I'm not working with that. 
[02:08:00]  Hurtful, topical.  Wait, you're not on the gig, Bonnie?  No.  Is that a genre?  Hurtful, topical.  Yeah, but if you want family-friendly Broadway style.  Ah.  Like a wet-for-no-reason pretzel.  Yeah.  Served by a terrorist.  So much time.  Wet-for-no-reason.  Now, what's your bonus, uh, your bonus number?  Fifty?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, now they've got inside shit going on.  Every comic has this thing of, like, when do they pull the curtain? 
[02:08:30]  You know?  Where they disguise half the room, the empty, your career is dead part of the room?  Yeah.  It is like putting a veil over a body.  Like, all right, you don't need to see this.  You don't need to see this.  Well, at least they make the curtain black, so they are trying to trick everybody.  Yeah, Mike, I get a curtain off after the second row.  I go up wearing a curtain on my head.  Just not to see.  I'm horrible.  I used to walk into Carolinas and go, oh, it's a curtain show.  Oh, okay.  And then you lower your expectations a little bit. 
[02:09:00]  That's what's great about the road gigs.  The rooms I do are so small, they can't have a curtain.  Oh.  I did a room.  Just the shower curtain.  I did a room two weeks ago where, one, I wasn't allowed to say fuck or do crowd work.  Why are they doing that shit to you guys?  I understand doing it to fucking radio guys, but leave the stand-ups alone.  Who gives a fuck?  What's the problem with saying fuck on stage?  He wants to compete against the other club that's dirty.  He wants to be the clean club.  Well, that's just stupid. 
[02:09:30]  What club is it?  They should be called out.  Every one of these clubs that do that to you guys should be called out.  I'm not saying the club.  I'm not going to burn the bridge.  Look like Bonnie's like, don't you fucking.  Dave, do you think that's stupid?  I don't see why you should burn that funny bone bridge.  No, I think it's horrible.  Especially if you get a guy like Voss in here.  You know he's going to be edgy, as they say.  And crowd work.  As I would say, a little blue.  Oh, what are they doing?  They're going to fuck that up too?  Friday. 
[02:10:00]  Wait, wait, hold on.  Go ahead, go ahead.  So, the sign out front goes, no F-bombs at this club.  Oh, it said F-bombs?  Yeah.  Well, you're not going to say fuck.  He should just sell the club is what he should do.  But anyhow.  But you got an A.  He gave you an A.  I heard this on the podcast.  Rich now gets graded A.  I got an A.  So he's called for now grading the comics.  Grade A comedian, Rich Voss.  Does he actually sit you down and tell you what grade you got?  No, no, I had an argument. 
[02:10:30]  Friday and Saturday, the first shows were good shows.  You know, 150.  Okay, okay.  The second show Saturday.  Hold on.  No, he has to build it up because he's got to tell on himself a little bit that he didn't  fill it up second show Saturday.  But it's an interesting topic and he's going to fuck it up.  No, I'm telling you right now.  The second show Saturday, there was 25 people.  No, 24.  In a 300 seat room.  Scattered.  Not even together.  That's nice.  So how you, you can't do your fucking dog and pony show. 
[02:11:00]  You got to do talk to the crowd.  Yeah.  So I'm talking to the Navy guy.  I'm, thank you for your service.  I mean, then there was a Marine guy go, well, I'm sorry.  You take, you know, and I, whatever I said.  And then after the show, well, I wasn't too happy.  You kind of downplayed the Navy.  I go, are you fucking kidding me?  I was.  What?  He's critiquing your fucking.  So I said, what do you mean?  I go, are you kidding me?  You're fucking.  I go, I killed both shows.  I kept it clean.  I even recorded one because I don't ever do clean shows. 
[02:11:30]  I record.  He goes, no, I'm giving you an A.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks so much.  He didn't push for an A plus at that point.  He's giving me an A.  And where does his A go?  Does he go on a big board at the club or something?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a gold star next to your name.  It's in the computer program.  They can look it up.  See, here's the deal.  We have to deal with one set of assholes here at SiriusXM.  I can't imagine you guys that travel around the country have to deal with different assholes  in every city.  But not usually headliners don't.  Some, I'm sure, are being cool, but you've got to deal with dicks. 
[02:12:00]  Not usually when you're at a headline, you do whatever the fuck you want.  Not anymore if they're telling you no F-bombs and they're grading you.  I can see this guy's theory.  I can see why he's trying to compete with the other club and get an older audience.  I get his point.  Okay?  But still.  Old people like the word fuck, too.  I know.  I know.  They do.  They're cooler than the young people now.  And the young people are more often.  You know what?  They're very politically correct, those young kids.  Yeah.  They really are.  Dave's pretty accurate with that statement.  You get a lot of, ooh.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yeah.  A lot of girls are out looking around. 
[02:12:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Men looking at their women to see if they can laugh.  Yeah, yeah.  Did we lose a war?  What?  What's going on here?  Men looking at their women?  Yeah, they're like, is this okay, honey?  Oh, dear.  Looking at the black guy in the audience.  Uh-oh.  That's the worst.  Oh, did he say something that's going to upset my African-American friend?  I don't have one black friend in my life, but I'll pander.  You know, though, it would be worth your time to just pay a local black guy to come  in, sit near the front, have him laugh at everything.  I try not to have black comics on before me, because the audience falls for what, it's 
[02:13:00]  hard.  I love black comics.  Oh, it falls for it.  By the way, this is why you-  You know that no black comic can get a laugh without white guilt, right?  Right, right, right.  Right, right.  Do you understand that?  Don't get me wrong.  Don't get me wrong.  On the road, I'm not talking about New York.  You go on the road, and you get these, I can't, they're so likable.  Just.  You know, and energetic, and-  Hacky.  Yeah, I'm not talking New York comics, obviously.  I know.  And they're fucking energetic.  You know, I'm on the road, and they- 
[02:13:30]  They bamboozle the audience.  They do.  I gotta go up with my-  If they start dancing, I mean, it is lights out.  I go up there with, you know, something that might seem racist.  Uh-huh.  The fucking crowd is here.  I just imagine his opener is coming on with, like, a basketball.  Yeah, yeah.  This is why both of you were cut out of the Mom's Mabley documentary.  Whoopi's like, I'm not having it.  No.  You're both out.  No.  I don't want to hear your geneticisms.  I don't want to hear your geneticisms.  Eugenics.  Do you care who opens for you? 
[02:14:00]  Do you get, like, or-  I either, like, it's either a guy who's too dirty to get in the club himself, or like a local.  Oh.  Yeah.  So I really don't care.  You don't give a fuck either.  But I'll tell you, now most of the openers, it seems like it's really hard for anybody  to get into the clubs now, so I feel bad for all the younger comics.  Well, yeah, I get emails all day long, can you take me with me, you, or, you know what  I mean, can I do this in Philly or D.C. with you, and-  I'll suck your cock.  Yeah.  You get that?  Huh?  You ever get that?  Not at home. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  Wow, edgy.  That was edgy.  Interesting.  My mouth isn't tipped.  It's sipped.  All right, and what about Obamacare, Rich?  Yeah, Rich.  It's fucking killing me, because Oxford UnitedHealthcare keeps raising my health insurance every year.  Every month it's going up $200, $250 a month.  Every month it's going up?  Well, for a year, yeah.  I mean, my payment a month is-  Oh, okay, I gotcha.  So I'm paying almost $20,000 a year in health insurance- 
[02:15:00]  That's crazy.  Okay, to subsidize for the people that aren't paying for it.  I'm subsidizing for these people.  But basically, it's not enough that I'm paying taxes, like you say, property tax, income, federal, state tax.  Well, the people at the bottom can't pay, so the government says, well, you don't have to, because we've got so much money coming in from Rich Voss and the other people. 
[02:15:30]  I'm not upper class.  I'm luckily middle class.  Well, no, no class.  So people think, hey, we're getting free health.  It's not free.  I'm fucking paying for it.  Well, there you go.  Okay?  I'm paying for it.  And don't get me wrong.  There's nothing I would rather see-  Middle class is paying the bill.  Well, it's a bigger problem.  You voted for him.  And people go, well, in the long run, it'll weed out.  No, I don't have time for the fucking long run to pay $20,000 a year on health insurance. 
[02:16:00]  Did you vote for him?  No.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  You know he didn't.  I love just going.  And also, it would be cheaper for me to buy a house, another house in, like, Florida or somewhere, you know, and have residency in Florida where your health insurance is, like, $500 or $600 a month.  You know, it would cost me $10,000.  I'll save $10,000 on health insurance, which-  So welcome to Obamacare. 
[02:16:30]  What can I do for you?  All I know is 50,000 people signed up for it.  That's like, whose Twitter is that?  That's like the least of the Kardashians.  It's like, there's a magician somewhere in, like, Oklahoma with Warren followers.  I mean, it's horrible.  No one really was clamoring for it.  And nobody, the people that really can't afford it, they don't understand, or they didn't understand that you had to pay for it anyway.  It's not free health care for most people. 
[02:17:00]  It's, you got to pay.  So they're selling you insurance.  If you didn't have it or don't give a shit about it, you're not going to sign up for it.  There's going to be a bunch of people not fucking signed up for it.  It's the website.  You understand this.  You're a comic.  I'm going to have to do this.  Building a good website is the hardest.  How did they, how did they fuck up the website?  They outsourced it to a Canadian software company, Bonnie.  How dare you.  Michelle Obama.  Manitoba Jones or somebody handled this.  Saskatchewan Steve.  Some shady dealings over the border.  Saskatchewan Steve's pretty good. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  Well, either way, it's a web problem.  It's amazing they fucked up a website in this day.  I know.  Exactly.  It's part of the thing.  Could you imagine a month later, if Amazon.com didn't work, how many heads would roll over  there?  Oh, my God.  But they're like, well, we're working on it.  What do you be working on?  Just fucking get it done.  Well, I've listened to interviews where they've had top web designers and companies and go,  we could have done it for a million.  Of course.  That's not the government way.  You've got to dump millions upon millions and get the worst possible product. 
[02:18:00]  They're terrible.  I'm not against it.  Of course you would want free health care.  Of course.  I mean, if it was right, if you got to see your own doctors and didn't wait a month for  Our government and system and people aren't set up for free health care.  Well, first of all, one of the reasons why I work in Canada is there's a lot fewer people.  It's Elysium.  They don't deserve to go to the spinny chip.  It's the spinny, nice place.  They can't be in the tanning bed of curists.  And I'm sorry, Bonnie.  You know, everyone in Canada fucking crows about that wonderful free health care and stuff. 
[02:18:30]  The only reason you guys are able to have socialism and social programs like you do up there.  Let's remember, socialism killed the Jews.  Right.  Is one reason.  You're border with the United States of America.  And that's the only reason you're able to fucking, you know, it's like being, you're fucking in the same family with, like, some rich guy.  And you're able to buy some toys and have some fun because, you know, the rent's going to get paid. 
[02:19:00]  But wait, we're not subsidizing Canada.  No, it does too.  How are we subsidizing Canada?  It's not subsidizing Canada.  It's that Canada doesn't have to spend horrific amounts of money on, like, national defense because they know we're not going to sit still while Canada gets invaded.  Yeah, but that's not fair because if you weren't here, we wouldn't, there would be no reason to have a national defense.  Oh, stop it.  You joined NATO.  You don't think the Soviet Union would have plowed over Canada if it wasn't for fucking the United States being there? 
[02:19:30]  Please, all that shit.  There's a lot of countries that don't have people trying to invade them.  It's the direct border with the United States makes it national security to keep you guys safe.  And that's what we've done since the beginning of the United States.  Well, how come we don't do it for Mexico?  Because Mexico's a piece of shit and we don't even care about it.  Okay.  Let the drug lords kill each other.  They're the best neighbors ever, the Mexicans.  Showing up working, bringing drugs.  Why can you do that, Canada?  And bringing drugs.  We dare Canada.  We got Colin.  We shielded Geronimo. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, sorry.  Sorry about that.  We got Colin Quinn that wants to pipe in here.  Oh, shoot.  Mr. Quinn?  Wow, it looks like I stepped into a real maelstrom.  Rich doesn't know that word.  Maelstrom.  He thinks it's a gay club.  I said it to make Rich laugh.  Yeah.  Wow.  How are you, Colin?  Carl.  Wow, what's going on?  You should have come in.  We got Rich, we got Bonnie, we got David Tell in studio today.  Wow.  You guys are really lighting it up, huh? 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  Every club in the city is covered.  Where are you doing your Spanix show this weekend?  My what?  Nothing.  Spanix.  So, boss, why don't you block me like you do with the rest of your followers?  Are you a blocker?  There's nothing worse than watching boss lecture his followers.  Yeah, there is one thing worse.  Your second one-person show.  Wow. 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  Great church.  Oh, that was me.  That's his work.  I saw that show.  It was a great show.  I know.  I love it.  You know what happened?  It's my fourth one-person show.  The only one that's seen all my shows is David Tell.  I did.  And I loved it.  It's about the Constitution, okay?  Yes.  But how happy were you when he skipped from 6 to 11?  Come on.  Well, all I'm going to say is I also saw Mike Tyson's thing, and Mike Tyson had better graphics,  but your story made sense.  Wow.  Wow.  There was no holes in your story.  So go see Colin's show.  Can I just say something? 
[02:21:30]  Rich used to always just kiss Colin's ass constantly, constantly, constantly.  And then just one day it dawned on him, one-man show.  Like, Colin can't help him.  Oh, right.  He figured it out.  Oh, shit.  That's where you're wrong.  Solo show.  Colin is my favorite comic anywhere, anytime.  Okay.  Tell us in my top 25.  No, Colin's the guy.  Colin, Colin.  I didn't even make the top 25 dance.  He's the only one I ever fucking mentioned in an article on radio, because he's brilliant. 
[02:22:00]  Wow, that must be a lot of press for me.  Okay.  Why do you think I use his cousin to open for me whenever I'm on Long Island?  Oh, right.  I try to keep it in his family.  I like Tim Gage.  I love him.  Leave my cousin out of it.  Fucking call me his brother.  Beat the shit out of my cousin.  Wow.  You got to let that one go, Colin.  No, we're not letting go.  You hold a grudge, I think.  We're not letting it go.  Joey C used to beat up Tim Gage, and we don't like it.  Are we at least over the Mark Cuban incident? 
[02:22:30]  No.  Oh, man.  I'm over it, but every time I fucking see that Mark Cuban's face in the news, I watch it.  That new?  That cartoon watching dollars.  What about Paul Anka?  Are you over that?  Well, that was just...  That's a good question.  Yeah.  So you're over Paul Anka, and you're not over Mark Cuban.  What happened with Mark Cuban?  We kind of...  I don't know.  We were lame.  We were lame that day.  Me and Bill Burr were kissing Mark Cuban's ass a little too much. 
[02:23:00]  And Colin was relegated to the couch.  It just got ugly.  And then I took a shot at Colin.  I wasn't really taking a shot, but it might have been...  Yeah, he's like misplaced to anger.  Oh, he was just angry.  Oh.  He was like, oh, I guess this guy's a whipping boy.  He fucking...  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Wow.  Give me a coffee.  A lot of people watch that, so it was just ugly. 
[02:23:30]  And I was the one that had the previous relationship with Mark Cuban.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was a small one, but you know.  Yeah, but it was a relationship.  What do you think...  Colin, can I ask you a professional...  You know that guy Incognito?  You know that...  Yeah.  When do you think he'll start touring?  Because I cannot see him not turning this into like a club thing or a podcast.  I can just not see it.  I mean, he is the guy of the moment.  He's in your face.  We all know where he stands racially.  Well, I mean, he's going to get a reality show, I guess. 
[02:24:00]  Something like that.  Do you guys think it's lame when guys get stand-up...  When they start doing stand-up because they just were in the news for something?  Oh, all of a sudden they're like...  One just called in.  That is a slam.  Jesus.  Rich, are you saying that as a comic or as the supporter of a social net of health care?  I like how you think you have like this job, like you're a retired something like airline pilot.  How much Social Security do you think you actually paid into the system over all the many years? 
[02:24:30]  Social Security?  Yeah, or whatever it is.  Ah, 8,000.  There you go.  There you go.  That's a good couple of weeks.  You're like one check away from like the meth guy who also worked at a Denny's as a cover job.  The meth cook.  Do you have health insurance?  I think so.  I don't know.  Jesus!  I usually go down to Voodoo.  Like, what do we call it?  Voodoo is the stop gate.  In New Orleans, they have the Voodoo shops.  It's like they're Dwayne Reed.  They really do have it down there.  People walk in. 
[02:25:00]  Sorry to hack it up.  Sorry, guys.  Where were we?  Oh, yeah.  Health care.  All right.  Carl, what are you doing?  Where are you?  Yeah, are you doing New York?  Nothing, guys.  You don't have to talk.  I just don't listen in for a while.  It's lonely here.  Aw.  You should have came in.  He's out in Staten Island.  Oh, you're far now.  You're in Staten Island now?  I miss the days when Colin was pretty much across the street and he would almost come  in with his pajamas on.  Huh?  A little bit of Staten Island very now, yeah.  But I was like, I didn't want to interrupt you guys were hammering Bonnie about the Canadian 
[02:25:30]  health care.  Well, yeah.  I don't want that to end just because I called in.  Oh, no.  That was great stuff.  I was just, I think it's reasonable to say that the Canadians were able to spend their  money on a lot of other things to make their country better because the United States  was down here with, you know, pouring money into our military, keeping the evil people  away from this hemisphere.  We have their back.  You've seen that movie, The Devil's Brigade.  Haven't you?  Yes, sure.  That's the best.  We gave them one fucking job, which is watch Rwanda and look what they did. 
[02:26:00]  I'll tell you a story about my friend and I when we would just go to the doctor and  get like, you know, like, you know, whatever we needed.  Birth control plugs.  Yeah, you know, condoms, birth control, whatever.  Oh, shit.  And our doctor, we had to take an AIDS test in order to get free stuff.  Sometimes you had to do something.  Whose blood did you give?  So we took an AIDS test and then he brought us in and he sat us in together and he goes, 
[02:26:30]  one of you has AIDS.  Holy shit.  No fucking way.  Yeah, and I, my friend, my friend Lynn, I knew it was her.  I was like, oh, shit, Lynn has AIDS.  And then he goes, ah, just kidding.  Holy fuck.  Holy jokester.  Wow.  That's how they pay for it with that Canadian sense of humor.  I didn't get it.  Who is this Jim Carrey of, who is this?  Wow, that's funny. 
[02:27:00]  And we got our birth control pills and left.  And the hair sweat and rubbed.  Then you guys got back on your sled and headed to their life below zero.  We can afford a sled.  We had snowshoes.  Here's the good thing about the Canadian, like, they have our festivals up there, which is  a slam on this country, that we can't hold our own comedy festivals.  Like, we have the New York comedy festival.  Were you involved in this?  Yeah, we did one night.  Okay.  We did a podcast thing.  But that's how less I draw. 
[02:27:30]  Like, I can't do that festival.  And then also we're Caroline's.  I have to pick one.  So I always pick the club over the festival.  And it never feels like a festival.  It doesn't.  I mean, that Montreal thing is amazing.  It feels more like that wedding in Game of Thrones.  The red wedding.  The red wedding.  Everyone's going to die.  I'll tell you something.  Yes?  I was going to just be quiet and enjoy this conversation, but the New York comedy festival  infuriates me on a fucking level so big.  I can't even take it right now.  Go ahead, Carl.  Spill.  Why?  Because I've never really been given any fucking... 
[02:28:00]  You can be on shows in the New York comedy festival and find out a week later you were  in the New York comedy festival.  I didn't realize at the time.  You didn't know at the time?  That sounds like a fucking piece of shit run festival.  You weren't in the festival, Colin?  Jerry wasn't doing anything?  I wasn't in it.  Actually, like Bonnie said, accidentally, that Bob Kelly podcast show was in the fucking festival.  There you go.  Oh, see?  I've come.  That's why you got paid more than $25, Colin. 
[02:28:30]  That's festival money.  That's festival.  It was $100.  That was a good show, though.  Nice.  Colin is my favorite person.  He's my favorite person.  My brother.  It's so much fun to be with him.  It really is.  Oh, Jesus.  I bet you don't say to him.  I've got to get my testosterone checked.  Oh.  I don't need it with him.  He can't fuck Bonnie anymore.  I don't know what happened.  He needs some testosterone.  Yeah.  Or Viagra.  Hey, Colin, can you tell them what a good actor I am, please? 
[02:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Louis Beans, remember?  Louis Beans.  What's that?  Oh, I'd love to hear that again.  That was when he did...  That was one of the greatest moments.  It really was a great moment.  Rich Voss acting.  Dave, do you know about that one?  No.  You don't know this?  Play this.  Oh, this is great.  Play it.  It's quick.  I want to just ask this.  This is from a Bronx tale.  Right.  Oh, now I know.  Okay, go ahead.  I want to hear it.  Oh, my God.  They tricked me into thinking I was going to read with Norton.  With Norton.  And Norton's as bad of an actor as I am at the time. 
[02:29:30]  Norton's good, though, now.  I saw him do something.  Yeah.  I like when he doesn't have any dialogue and he just uses his eyes.  Oh.  You like that?  He can communicate so much.  Yeah.  Because he's blinking Morse code.  He's known as loud eyes.  Lower your eyes.  He's blinking up the scenery.  His eyes are overacting.  So then, yeah.  He was like the dog in the artist.  Right.  So we switched out. 
[02:30:00]  We switched out to Norton.  For Chaz Palminteri, who, of course, wrote a Bronx tale.  Starred.  Yeah.  Starred in the movie and did the one-man show.  Yeah.  So he did a scene.  And, of course, Chaz Palminteri is just flawlessly natural doing it.  And we're going to put it.  Guys, you're not doing the interviews.  Relax.  I'm a fucking guest.  I'm not there.  We're Cuban all over again.  We're going to do the dry version.  Every guest is a god on fucking Opie and Anthony.  No, I said, look, we've gotten better since you called us out. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, I notice it every time now.  No, I feel like we've gotten better since the big call-out from Colin Quinn.  Every time I ask a question.  So back in 1974, when I just imagined Colin listening, going, oh, shut up.  Stop it.  He pretty much says we stop our whole show.  To kiss their ass.  And he's right.  I know.  For the most part, he's right.  We suck.  Here's the dry version of that day.  We usually play the production piece.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So here we go.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, my God.  See, what are you doing?  Come on.  What are you yelling about?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20, and it's been two weeks now, and every time he sees me, he keeps dodging  me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  Listen, see, come on.  Sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John, I don't even like him.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on.  You got up cheap. 
[02:31:30]  You're right, John.  You're always right.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny?  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time, and I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  What do you read?  That was the only real moment.  I read things.  You know, I read philosophy.  Philosophy?  You read philosophy?  Come on, John.  Sure.  You read Machiavelli?  Who?  Come on.  Nick Machiavelli.  Who?  Oh, wow.  That was good. 
[02:32:00]  That's right.  That you read line, I think, was your best line.  That guy with Voss, he's going to make it.  Yeah.  That guy.  He's all right.  Were you holding the script, or can you memorize it?  No, I got in here.  First of all, they said, come in tomorrow.  And then I got in here.  They go, you and Norton are going to read the script together.  You know, I didn't practice.  I did an audition yesterday.  Knocked it out of the park.  Yeah, why practice for our big radio show?  What was the audition for?  Because I didn't have it.  They didn't give me the sides or anything until I went in that morning. 
[02:32:30]  I didn't have a regular store.  Is that my coffee?  Thank you.  Wow, look at that little airplane meal you made for yourself.  A little quick flight to Albany.  So that was, I didn't know that you were an actor as well as a comic.  Yeah, that was good.  It was my oatmeal.  There's this guy, Louie Beans.  We missed that part because the track skipped.  Do you want to hear that?  Yeah.  Boy, that's Chaz Mollman.  He was a good sport to do that.  Oh, yeah.  He was great, man.  Because think about it.  That's like a dolphin swimmer with a tart. 
[02:33:00]  I mean, he's such a good actor.  Exactly.  That'd be like a dolphin swimmer with a tart holding a bowling ball.  I mean, he is so good.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Play that first part.  Let's quick.  Go ahead.  Let's go.  Here we go.  Louie, Beans, I want my money.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Look at you.  Say, what are you doing?  Come on, what are you doing?  You can't dodge me forever.  I've got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie, Beans.  Louie, Beans. 
[02:33:30]  All right, that's enough.  I love that.  Guy, Louie, Beans.  Oh, is that great?  Now, this has been going on for 10 years.  I've got a clip of ice cream coming out of Colin's ass in Grown Ups 2.  That was real method acting right there.  Oh, what happened there?  I saw it.  I didn't see Grown Ups 2.  By the way, the fact that Voss has really zeroed in on that lately. 
[02:34:00]  It's because it's the last thing.  What's the problem with that scene?  Nothing.  Colin was very funny.  He saved the movie.  I didn't see it.  Oh, shut up.  It was good.  I'm telling you.  People get trashy, and then at the last minute, you always back off a little bit.  It's really annoying.  I know.  He's so in love with Colin.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you were the one that brought it up like it was a horrible scene, and now you're  saying he saved the movie.  No, he did.  Up to that point where he became a prop actor. 
[02:34:30]  I'm just kidding, Colin.  I love you.  I love you.  Yeah, I better not get that fucking call later.  Hey, you know, we can get a kid around.  You know, on a radio show.  You know, we all pump things up.  All things are being equal.  I thought I was the only one that got those calls.  You're not mad, right?  We all were taking shots.  We're having a good time.  How was my appearance?  I thought I did good.  I want to grade myself. 
[02:35:00]  He used to call me and give himself grades.  I was a club owner then.  Well, now the club owner's doing that to you.  What do you think of that, Kyle?  There's a club Rich played recently, no F-bombs, and they grade you at the end.  What the fuck is that about?  A grade A comic.  Huh?  Who does?  The club owner?  Yeah, he won't tell us which one, but I think that's fucking bullshit.  I pray more club owners don't go down that road. 
[02:35:30]  Goddamn moron.  It was just Stretch Factory.  What?  I'm okay.  It can't be Vinny.  What did this club owner give you?  No, Vinny, you have to grade him.  He will hound you after the show.  What'd you think?  Did you like it?  Did you watch all the new stuff?  What you do, you watch Vinny, you try to grab one thing, you know, and then you can go and  mingle with your friends.  Oh, so you can talk about it.  So later after, you're like, the bit about the whatever, that was fantastic.  He's like, oh, yeah, thanks.  Thanks.  But what about the other one?  I know. 
[02:36:00]  What about the other one?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What would you give me, an A or a B?  What?  Anyway.  I like when McBottis.  But we love him.  We love him.  He's great.  We love him.  We're talking about Norton's expressive eyes.  That way he's not acting.  He's like the governor on Walking Dead with that one eye, but he has two eyes.  He's like, really looking.  It's like his whole face is a mask.  Looking for a recurring part in the distance. 
[02:36:30]  Hey, Kyle, what are you doing tomorrow?  You want to come in?  Yeah.  I'm serious.  It's our last show before the big turkey thing, you know.  Did he just pretend to look through the daily news?  I heard the paper rustling.  Let me check my schedule.  And no one even has one of those anymore.  You just use your phone.  And then you can go from here to Joan Hamburg. 
[02:37:00]  I'll see you guys later.  Oh, what's that about?  What's that about?  What's that about, Rich?  He said it, but it was funny.  Okay.  The timing was right.  All right, Colin.  If you want to come by tomorrow, we'd love to have you.  That's a real invite.  Thank you.  Are we promoting anything?  No.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  What am I saying?  I'm at Tarrytown Friday and Bayshore Saturday.  You guys are going to come out.  Oh.  That's a great theater.  That's a great theater.  Wait, you're at Bayshore West Saturday?  Yeah. 
[02:37:30]  I'm going to go.  Holy fuck.  I might be on Long Island, too.  I'm going.  Come on, fellas.  This is it.  I'm right there.  I'm right there.  That's Tarrytown Theater.  That's perfect for a show like that.  Is that the old porno theater?  We're right next to the conch.  Yes.  The old Bayshore porno theater.  Right.  Used to go there before videos.  You know, you'd have to go.  It was the old theater, yeah.  Yeah.  I went in high school.  Yeah, that was great.  That used to be a road trip with some road sodas.  I'm in a porn theater in Bayshore.  Bayshore.  Nice.  If I come in tomorrow, we have to discuss a road trip also with a certain gentleman. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, with Bobo.  That's correct.  So maybe we should have Bobo in tomorrow.  Why not?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Why not?  Right.  We're doing a road trip with Colin and Bobo, the stars.  I'm going along to maybe film it.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  It started out as a goof, but I want to do this, even if it's a day thing.  Well, Bobo thinks we're going to do a test show.  We're going to do a test.  We're going to do a test.  We're going to do a test.  Like up to fucking Westchester or something.  This could be the equivalent of that Bruce Dern movie that's out now. 
[02:38:30]  The independent classic.  Walking to.  Stark.  In the cornfields.  What is that movie, Colin?  What is that movie?  It's like Kansas City or something like that.  That's not Nebraska, is it?  Nebraska.  Yeah, it's okay.  Ah, that's the movie.  Hey, when a, when a, didn't he like win some fake?  Yeah.  Lottery.  Heading towards a dream or a fantasy.  Everyone's telling him it's not real.  I'm walking.  Oh, no.  That doesn't sound good.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  All right, guys.  Bye.  All right, Colin.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Colin Quinn, everyone.  He is great.  I love the great Colin Quinn.  Rich Voss, Gotham this weekend.  David Tell, Caroline's this weekend.  We're going to break so you guys can eat, and we'll continue.  Okay.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Got a busy room today. 
[02:39:30]  Rich Voss in studio playing Gotham tonight and tomorrow.  No, when are you playing?  This weekend?  Friday, Saturday at Gotham.  I'm starting to think this is like Friday.  I'm all fucked up because of this.  I know.  It's only Thanksgiving shit.  Oh, yeah.  It's only Tuesday.  Fuck.  It's Indian Friday.  But it feels like a Thursday because we have tomorrow and then we're off.  Yeah.  So you got to say, ah, it's Thursday. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Hey, how about a shout out for Hanukkah and Thanksgiving finally buddying up the way they  should?  That's right.  Whoa.  Burying the hatchet.  Boom.  That is true, right?  Rich, jump in on this.  You're a Jew.  Go ahead.  No.  Hanukkah starts early, huh?  It's ridiculous.  When does it start?  You're like, now?  Because it's wandering around the calendar.  You know my Hanukkah?  You know how I know about the Jewish holidays?  What's that?  You know how I know about the Jewish holidays?  B&H Photo doesn't fucking deliver on certain days.  They can't take the order right away when there's certain holidays. 
[02:40:30]  That's all I know.  How are they in business?  It's amazing.  That's how great they are.  They could close when the sun goes down and still make the ends meet.  You know what?  You could still log in.  It's unbelievable.  You know what, though?  The efficiency of that place is definitely ripped up from the Nazis.  It's amazing.  It really is.  They live in the camps.  It's very efficient.  Oh, my God.  There's, like, fucking conveyor belts.  One guy takes care of this.  One guy's standing there with a thumbs up or thumbs down on your order.  He's getting off the fucking box car. 
[02:41:00]  It looks like...  You know when they go see the guy with the beard?  Looks like someone was paying attention back in the day.  I lost my umbrella there, and they said, go to the Loser Valley, and there was, like, umbrellas,  then shoes, then little kid shoes, then eyeglasses.  Come on.  If they had just kept all that shit in a pile, nobody would have hated them.  But the separating of them, that's what...  That's the Nazi anal.  Very nice.  Holy shit. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, that's funny, man.  Eyeglasses.  I love that place, though.  You could fucking order something, like, in the morning, and by the next morning, it's delivered right to your door.  Unless it's a Friday.  Well, yeah.  You know how they owe those people.  They just walk it over, don't they?  They sent you a fucking book this big in the mail.  Yeah, the catalog.  The catalog.  The catalog.  The Torah.  By the way, people don't know how big you were doing.  You were doing...  What?  When you said this big, people didn't realize you were doing the size of your cock. 
[02:42:00]  Whoa!  Booyah!  Yes!  Good night!  Nice.  Boom, baby.  Oh, me and my ass all weekend.  Damn.  Doing laundry.  You got another star calling in.  What?  Oh, what?  Hello?  Yeah, this is Bobo.  Gosh, this is Bobo.  You know Bobo?  Everybody knows Bobo, right?  He's Adam Lance's friend, right?  Yes, yes, Adam Lance's friend.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God. 
[02:42:30]  Bobo.  Bobo, explain to David Tell what you're doing with Colin Quinn.  Everyone needs to know.  Go ahead.  No, what I'm planning with Colin Quinn is a road trip from New York to L.A.  Oh.  It's going to be a road trip, and there's going to be, like, all different kinds of things  that take place in each of the states we pass through.  So, let's say you pass through Texas.  What's going on in the panhandle of Texas?  Well, maybe we have things we do with Texas.  Maybe something that's synonymous with Texas.  Like what? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, you should know all this now.  What's synonymous with Amarillo?  This has been in the planning for months.  Well, the thing is, we don't...  Look, if we...  They haven't mapped out their trip here.  No, at this point, if we name a state, you need to tell us what you're doing in that state.  What states are you going through?  Let's start with, I don't know, let's start with...  Jersey.  Yeah, let's start with Jersey, your first state.  Jersey.  New Jersey.  What are you doing?  Well, let's say Jersey, I guess we did. 
[02:43:30]  Jersey, I haven't thought it yet.  I know...  What are you going to do?  Are you going to go by 95?  It is a tough state.  And if you're going across country from Jersey, wouldn't Texas be out of the way?  Well, you take the southern route or the northern route.  They might have to take the southern route because the weather's starting to get cold.  Southern route takes you down Texas and then you get through New Mexico and Arizona and stuff  so you can kind of see the Grand Canyon, Great Meteor Crater.  Okay.  I would just get on Route 80 and go straight.  Well, you could do that.  I'm a little sexually attracted to Bobo. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  Wow.  He's got a tilted penis.  Bobo, yeah.  No, he's my type.  He is.  You can tell.  He doesn't know what's happening.  Yes, you can.  I can tell the similarity.  You do have a type.  Who's doing the driving, Bobo?  You recall.  Well, it could be both of us at different points.  Now, Bobo, you don't have a license, though.  Yeah, but by that time, hopefully, if everything goes as planned, I'll have a license.  When is this plan going?  There's no better way to learn to drive than on the road itself.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:44:30]  That is the best way to do it.  This is slated for March.  Oh, it's slated for March.  Now, you don't have a license.  It's slated for March, and you're going to learn to drive going cross-country.  Well, I'll be driven a bit before then, of course.  But it's a lot different driving cross-country.  Highway driving.  Yeah, that's hard.  Proficient highway driving.  Remember seeing the planes, trains, and all that? 
[02:45:00]  Fucking college.  Yes.  All right, Bobo.  This isn't working.  Maybe you can work the mixtapes.  They're going to make a nice, good, long road mixtape.  And when you go through North Carolina, Bobo, my friend Roy is building development, and  he's naming the street after me, Voss Terrace.  Oh, good.  Somehow he made that story about him.  How does he do it?  How do he do it?  I wanted to bring up my friend Roy.  I wanted to bring up my friend Roy in North Carolina.  He's a developer. 
[02:45:30]  It's like a Kevin Bacon thing with him.  Everything goes right back to him.  You don't get it.  I was bringing up my friend Roy.  Chris Rich never asks a follow-up question unless it's going to U-turn right into...  Why are you...  You're crazy.  Why are you saying that about me?  Is that your joke?  Yeah.  Bobo.  Bobo.  When you're merging onto a highway...  Oh, good question.  Yeah.  Who has the right of ways?  The white person.  Right. 
[02:46:00]  The person that's already on the highway.  Whoa!  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  All right.  The answer is always me.  That's what I'd say.  Me.  That's very good, Bobo.  What does a yield sign mean?  A yield sign means yield to the person that has the right of ways.  Whoa!  What's a blinking yellow?  A blinking yellow... 
[02:46:30]  Norton with hepatitis.  What do you do with a blinking yellow?  Dark before they throw a ninja star?  A blinking yellow is a pass-through with caution.  Ah.  He knows some of these...  He's kind of rain-man-ish when it comes to certain things.  Sure.  I bet he can pass the written test and then completely be an asshole on the road.  Just spinning around.  Yeah, yeah.  Just driving in circles.  Taking the fucking...  Going the wrong way on the on-ramp. 
[02:47:00]  A lot of these young kids...  I assume this Bobo is a young millennial.  They don't learn how to drive or anything like that.  They don't do it.  I guess they're...  Whatever their drone friends do.  Yeah, yeah.  They either get the...  Hello?  Hello?  Buzz.  All right, Bobo.  Is that turkey bacon?  No, I'm good.  I think I just ate enough on that last one.  Bobo, we're going to let you go.  You can come in tomorrow because Colin's going to be here so you guys can work out the road trip.  All right?  All right.  I'll be in tomorrow.  Oh, we can't wait, Bobo.  It's been so long. 
[02:47:30]  Maybe we'll give you a good driving test tomorrow.  Yeah.  Come up with some questions.  That was good.  Did you see that movie, 12 Years a Slave?  I haven't seen that.  I heard about it.  A lot of people trying to get me to see it to make me more tolerant.  Exactly.  Well, I don't know if I want to see it because it reminds me a lot of my Verizon plan.  Boss, come on.  Let's work out some of our gems.  That's very good.  I did one earlier.  You guys gave me nothing.  You were the only one who gave me just a little baby bird help. 
[02:48:00]  I can't wait until I'm really old and just in my own filth in a diaper wearing a bow tie like the old comic.  And that kind of thing.  And the nurse will have to like, mm-hmm.  Don't make it funny.  All the time for your pills.  That'll be the best.  Right around the corner.  Exactly.  Like fucking, um...  Like Jake LaMotta with that,  I fought sugar-y so many times I have diabetes. 
[02:48:30]  And then he says it like five, six more times.  At least.  In the next...  But then again, he's what?  Ten minutes.  How old was he?  Ninety or something?  Ninety.  And he's got this young chippy wife, the girlfriend wife, who's 70.  Are you talking about Rage and Bola, the real one?  Yeah, the real one.  The real guy was in here.  He came in here.  Did you read for that one?  She puts him up on stage.  She puts him up on stage and like he tells stories and he shadow boxes but he can't move.  But she swears that he still wants to do it. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, sure.  He doesn't want to be doing that shit.  And his wife's making him?  Well, she's saying she's not.  It's kind of like when you have to fly to Jacksonville.  Uh-oh.  His wife's making him.  That's going to be Bonnie with you.  What are you talking about?  What happened?  What happened?  I don't like him at home.  I try to get him to go on the road.  Oh, do you make little, uh, aw.  Poor little kitty.  Wait, what's going on?  I don't understand.  Do you have to go to Jacksonville?  How old is your daughter now?  Like 10?  I don't know.  Six.  When will she be working for the act? 
[02:49:30]  Like the actual, like the three generation kind of thing.  Oh, you know she's working on her mic technique.  It's just a matter of time.  I remember when we did the show and she came out and grabbed the mic.  I thought that was adorable.  It was great.  Dave put her in his jacket and zipped her up.  Oh, my God.  She's a baby head.  She fell asleep in there.  Yeah, like a little kangaroo in a junkyard.  Like a little kangaroo in a junkyard.  Alleged.  A rue.  No, but then when we were doing the show at Comics, at the Fall Comics, you remember  she came out on the stage at the end.  Yeah, she likes, she still likes going. 
[02:50:00]  One time we were at...  What are you guys, the least proud parents in America?  What?  I'm bringing up your own kid.  You should be excited about it.  I don't, I feel like people don't want to hear about the kids.  All right, all right.  This isn't a kid-friendly show.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  We're all parents here.  Come on.  Yeah.  I have a cat.  Just going to somebody going, who's your daddy?  Doesn't make you a parent.  I have my cat.  I apologize.  Fuck it.  I hate when people go, look at my kid.  They show you a picture of the dog, really? 
[02:50:30]  Oh, I hate that.  It's fucking good.  I am a bi-curious New Yorker.  I'm going to take offense at that.  I don't like poor quality photos of people's animals.  When they take pictures and they're like these blurry pictures, like it sucks.  Take a good picture, you dumb animal.  After your show.  That's his issue.  Do you sell merchandise after your show?  No.  You don't do that.  He doesn't talk a million times about selling merch.  Oh, no.  Okay.  You can't do it again. 
[02:51:00]  One more time, no.  Do people come up to you after your show and go, can I take a picture?  Yes.  And they have no idea how to work their own art?  Yes.  You've been taking a million fucking pictures.  But aren't you happy that someone wants your picture?  Yeah, but give the fuck.  Lemonade?  Making some lemonade?  Who cares?  Yeah, I hear you.  Because when you're selling merch, you're holding up the line.  Oh, I see.  Oh.  Hey, Jew.  But that's weird because you're right.  They don't know how to work their own cameras.  And then they give it to the drunkest friend to do it.  And that's always a mistake. 
[02:51:30]  I like the one that comes back like 10 minutes later and goes, yeah, it was blurry.  Can we do another one?  Because it took them that long to review the picture.  Yeah, it's just the same thing of they don't know how to use their cameras.  Thank you.  Does that happen when you're playing in the rock band?  When you're out?  Oh, yeah.  Without doing it.  Yeah, so many pictures.  No.  You still go out and jam, right?  Very rarely.  But if my brother gets something together and gets everybody in one place at one time,  sure, I'm game.  You usually do it around the holidays. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  You just get out there or what?  When you do something like now, like Wednesday night at one of those Long Island bars,  you used to like fucking fast eddies.  Or something?  Staten Island stinks.  That's been going for 15 years.  I don't know.  That's the Staten Island and you're talking.  Yeah.  What do you need us to ask you?  What is it?  How is it coming back?  What do you need?  I'm not.  I'm just saying.  We're not figuring this one out.  How could you make fun of Long Island like that?  When I grew up there, everybody in this room pretty much lives there.  That's right. 
[02:52:30]  How did I make fun of it?  What borough president would you be?  You know de Blasio, I'll tell you that.  Oh, boy.  That's going to be fun.  Yeah.  Long Island's great.  You can drive out there without any traffic.  Oh, yeah.  He's being sarcastic.  He hates it.  You must have a problem with governors.  No, I love governors.  How about that Long Island Expressway, people?  Am I right?  That's what you do at governors and fucking brokerage.  No, you saw me at governors. 
[02:53:00]  I know.  It was great.  Thank you.  I had a pisser.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Ed came out with Keith the Cop.  Oh, yeah.  It was a star-studded evening.  Did you go to the dairy barn before or after?  Dairy barn.  It's right next door.  And there's a petco right across the parking lot.  You're going to have to step out of your vehicle to buy the beer.  You can't.  What?  They make you?  Yeah, you can't.  They can't sell you the beer through the window of your car.  Because dairy barn here, it's a drive-thru. 
[02:53:30]  It's this little drive-thru, a little shack with a silo next to it.  It says dairy barn.  It looks like a little farmhouse.  And you drive through and you buy like, oh, give me some potato chips.  Milk, eggs, and fucking donuts.  Right.  And then they sell beer.  So you go, ah, I'll take a six-pack of Bud.  And they go, you've got to step out of your vehicle and come in to grab the beer and get it.  Because they're not allowed to sell it when you're in the car.  Through the window, yeah.  And that's when you go, make me. 
[02:54:00]  And that's how Jerome Mackey got started.  Long Island beat down.  Hardcore taekwondo before Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  It started there.  And my fucking stories are boring.  You're talking about beer through the window.  Hey, man, people are.  I'm just saying it's odd that they would do that.  Meanwhile, they're selling it to you and you're getting right into your car anyway.  He's giving you information also.  That's a good.  You know, you're a fucking turncoat.  Oh, wow.  Anthony, you missed something.  Wow.  Hold on.  You missed something in there, though.  Using a phrase from his childhood. 
[02:54:30]  You missed his simple.  You bring it.  What did he do?  I missed it.  You missed his thought process.  The thought process of a simpleton.  You said it's like a barn.  And he goes, ooh, they're talking about barns.  Barns.  Oh.  And farms.  What does that mean?  That's her fucking dairy barn.  That's all he knows about me.  Dairy barn?  She grew up on a farm.  That's her.  Okay.  That's so away from the dairy barn.  We also had alcohol. 
[02:55:00]  They have, like, in Kitalia, you go on the road.  They do.  They have drive-through where you get liquor.  And they hand it.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a major alcohol problem, where you can't even get out of your car.  And you just.  It's just convenience.  Like everything else we want in this world.  I used to drink and drive all the time.  At the same time.  Like, I would drive around with a beer right between my legs there, driving and drinking the beer.  And not even wonder, like, what would I do if I got pulled over?  Like, where am I putting this beer?  I did that with crack.  Wow. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, one-ups.  You nailed it.  You old one-up guy.  How'd it get me?  Yeah, but how do you, like, a crack guy can afford a car, really?  Oh, yeah.  That must have been your first day of crack, to, like, still have the car.  Like, when did that all go?  When did all that stuff?  I tried to sell my friend's car.  He gave me his car to go cop, and I tried to sell it.  Oh, my God.  I got the radio out, and I said it got stolen, but I didn't have the bill of sale, and I  tried to sell his car, and I would have just said it got stolen.  That's all.  That is the best, the morgue story that you tell, about your drug, like, when, whenever 
[02:56:00]  that is, the bottom.  You know, like, with the head and all that kind of thing.  That is just great.  Am I giving a...  Is that...  I don't remember.  It's just the old bit you're talking about, or...  Yeah.  I'm trying to promote you, dude.  Yeah.  You might have a...  You're such a crackhead.  What's the story?  I don't remember.  I don't know.  You're in the morgue, and this guy's, like, do you remember this, where you're, like,  at the graveyard?  Oh, my God.  Haven't...  Is he getting high?  No, we used to get high at my French funeral home.  Okay, yeah, this is what I'm talking about. 
[02:56:30]  I'm sorry.  You can't figure out what Dave's talking about.  Yeah, the head and go, see, you can't have any because you're dead.  I was like, which one has Alzheimer's?  Okay.  He relates dairy barn to farms out of nowhere, but he can't relate the fucking funeral  home to the morgue.  Because he said graveyard instead of funeral home.  Right, right.  I'm sorry.  He's got a better memory.  It's a bit I used to do it.  I love the bit.  I compliment on you every time, except I will never do it again.  I didn't know...  In my head, it's the graveyard bit with the dead head guy.  And now, I didn't know it's the mortuary something... 
[02:57:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm going to bring the bit back.  Thank you.  Can we hear the bit?  No.  What happened?  No, I thought I was stepping on your closer.  No.  Get the guy's closer away on the radio.  You get that flash of your eyes, that one-eyed governor look.  That's like when people are like, you stole my bed.  I've been closing with that bed for 25 years.  That's my bed.  Oh, Rich.  But that's a good...  That was like...  Thank you.  The ultimate crack.  You would smoke a lot of crack, right? 
[02:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'd smoke as much as I'd get my hands on you.  That's what a crack addict's do.  You don't know.  That's enough.  I mean, like every day.  No, I'm good.  No one ever gets past the pipe and goes, nah.  No, I'm going to switch to water for an hour.  And then I'll get back on the crack.  I'm going to go for a job.  With your smoking crack, if there's enough there to smoke three days straight...  I remember this dude came to my house.  He brought two ounces of Coke to sell from Florida.  It was so fucking pure.  I mean, it was unbelievably the strongest Coke. 
[02:58:00]  And somehow my mother was gone for the weekend.  I was staying...  And we're selling Coke out of my house.  I mean, people are in an apartment building, like, just knocking on nonstop fucking in  and out.  The dude passed out.  And I took his fucking ounce of Coke, right?  And I took an eighth out.  And I cut it with an eighth of, you know, whatever you cut Coke with.  Yeah, baking soda and not so tall.  Baby laxative.  Baby laxative stuff that came in the cube. 
[02:58:30]  And it was so strong.  And, you know, he's sleeping.  I'm stealing.  Here's a better story.  Wait.  Then you go to the morgue.  How about you finish the first one?  Oh, my God.  What happened?  First of all, can I just say this before you launch?  You can't stop smoking.  What?  Into your next story.  I've never seen you so happy.  I think you should go back to drugs.  This is where your passion is.  He does love talking about drugs.  No.  No, I know what I'm talking about.  You love life insurance. 
[02:59:00]  There's a...  I bought this...  Like, I copped this guy an eighth.  He goes, get me an eighth.  And when you get it, put it under my door.  Oh, boy.  At my house.  Oh, no.  And then...  It got stolen.  No.  I put it under his door, right?  Yeah.  I kept going back...  I kept going back every 40 minutes.  I kept going back every hour with a hanger and pulling it back out.  Cutting it some more.  Coke is hilarious. 
[02:59:30]  Then another kid, he goes, look, this is where I was doing comedy.  He goes, I haven't seen you in a while.  He goes, I'm going to buy an eighth, right?  And we'll do a gram and I'll sell the other five half grams.  The other five half grams, right?  You got a free gram.  Yeah, a free gram.  Because it was $2.50 for the eighth.  Five half grams.  So we smoked a gram.  What would that be in today's money?  I don't even know that.  It was a million.  So he went to bed and I knew where he...  He could have barely had two grams. 
[03:00:00]  Where he hit the five grams.  Oh, no.  The five half grams.  So I would go in.  I would steal one half a gram.  Drive to the fucking convenience store and buy ammonia.  I was cooking in ammonia then.  Right?  And then I would throw the ammonia out.  He goes, I can't do it.  I made five trips by the ammonia.  To get a new bottle because you throw the...  Every time because I throw the other one out.  And I went in there.  I'm so fucked up.  I go, hey, I got a cleaning business.  And the guy woke up.  And all you heard was him yell, fuck! 
[03:00:30]  Because all this Coke was stolen.  It's gone.  Of course.  So you remember that story.  But you don't remember the graveyard slash morgue story.  That was a joke.  That was a joke.  Okay.  It was always a fine line between, can you sell the Coke that you've cut up and put  in the little half gram envelopes and stuff?  Can you sell it before you do it?  Because if it's just there and you do yours, like, because you took some out and then cut  it and you got the cell and then you got yours.  If you get rid of yours, you're just going to start doing the shit you're supposed to 
[03:01:00]  sell.  It's impossible.  It's impossible to have it in the house and not do it.  You're saying, now, if I cut this to quarter grams and throw in a pair of sneakers.  The guy came to our door once with a giant water jug from the water coolers full of pennies.  And he's just like, here, man.  Like, what the fuck are we going to do with this?  It's giving me anxiety thinking about it.  Oh, really?  People would come up with cameras and shit.  Oh, yeah.  I told you the golf club story many times. 
[03:01:30]  I think I told you that here.  I would go to garage sale and buy, like, $2 golf club sets, you know, like they would  have for, like, $3.  Then I'd go to drug dealers.  Hey, look, man.  I'll leave my clubs.  I'll be back for them.  I play golf.  You know, I got to have my club and I'll be back Monday.  And I'd get a gram and they'd never see me again.  You ever run into these old people that you owe money to?  I think no.  They're all dead.  Oh, I'm sure somebody went like...  Well, at least we get Gotham.  Yeah.  Throw it in there.  Come down to Gotham if I owe you money. 
[03:02:00]  I think it's only one stick on some coke, yeah.  There was only one I really owe money to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other guys, you know, the fuck they're...  It's their problem.  They should have known better.  Yeah, you don't give...  Caveat mTOR.  You know, one time, you know, they give it to you and they give it to you.  That's a great word in the drug culture.  Hey, my man, Caveat mTOR.  Caveat mTOR, nigga.  Yeah, that's what I said. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, shit.  You know, they put it in your hands.  They try to sell it.  It's half their fault.  You know?  I don't fucking...  I love it.  You know, it's a pedophile.  Watch my kid.  You don't do that.  You don't do that.  You know better.  You don't fucking do it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a fucking drug addict.  Oh, a day watcher.  You guys wanted me to hold your baby.  And what TV show was that again?  What rendition of your life story?  That was the lifetime one.  That was the one where...  Did I immediately say this is not good?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, you tried to help figure it out.  These guys are so funny and so dark and, like, just great. 
[03:03:00]  And then they always get involved with, like, Nickelodeon 3.  Hey, you're going to follow Gumball Princess Fairy time with this dysfunctional relationship.  Yeah, go ahead.  I overheard Rich on the phone.  Somebody had asked him, you know, what did you think of the pilot?  And I heard him go, I watched half of it.  And turned and punched Bonnie in the face.  It was so bad.  That pilot was fucking...  She got a beating.  That pilot was unwatchable.  Yeah, bad.  Yeah, but it's not your fault.  It's like you get involved in the wrong network.  Well, when you go in the pitch, they go, they love your ideas. 
[03:03:30]  And you go in...  And then they have to switch everything around with their nose.  Like, when we did the one for Comedy Central, it turned out great.  It was a great pilot.  I don't know why they didn't pick it.  But this one was so fucking bad.  Yeah.  They bought it.  They go, okay, we want it to be...  It looked like it's your house here.  And they rented us a house and moved all of our furniture into this fucking house.  I think it's also the same where they shot the wire.  Yeah.  That's the neighborhood they moved us into.  They spent a lot of money on you. 
[03:04:00]  Did you burn it down?  No.  That's what I started thinking, though.  Might have a talent.  That's pretty fucked up.  They're fucking...  They just...  They come in and fucking ruin everything.  Damn.  They're just fucking...  They're dumb notes.  Well, now you don't need them.  Like, we were just talking.  Like, you could do your own show, like, on one of these other platforms, you know?  That's right.  And I think that would be cool.  It doesn't even have to be a half an hour.  It'll be like 15, 20 minutes.  You know, like, webisode stuff.  Well, thanks, Dave.  Thanks.  We never thought of that.  I just wanted to out-ju...  I just wanted to throw a little Jew on the fire there. 
[03:04:30]  This guy's always thinking.  This guy.  Nobody ever wants to hear the what you should do involves you doing it with your own money.  But I just know you gotta man up and do your own stuff, so...  We made a fucking movie!  You mean I'm not gonna meet someone out of kookaroo or coffee bean and charm them with my comedy stylings?  I bought a new brassiere.  I think it's gonna be fine.  I'm into metal rock and roller derby. 
[03:05:00]  I'll find the exact reason.  I always liked that in L.A.  Like, what is that guy into?  Like, be into that?  You know?  Like, go see him?  Is that the...  I don't know.  I haven't had, like, a real meeting in, like, 15 years.  I mean, like, the assistant over the speakerphone, and there's, like, horrible connections.  And it's like, we're in the business of communication.  And it's like, I don't know what's going on with him.  Me?  Me?  And then it just ends.  So I assume I...  Whatever.  I've never got the part.  Help me out of this one.  Help me out of this one. 
[03:05:30]  You guys are the most unhelpful couple.  Rich, tell them about the meeting.  Rich can't make it about himself.  What about the meeting?  The one where the...  Oh.  The lady, she...  Oh, wait, hold on.  That one?  She brought her kid to the meeting, and she said, or, you know, we were in her office,  and her kid was there, and she goes, it's bring your kid to work day.  And I was like, that was last week.  I know.  I have a kid.  And I brought my kid to work.  Well, first of all, though...  She goes, oh, well, some people do it at different times.  She was just blatantly lying to us.  They canceled on us four times.  Why did they bring the kid in? 
[03:06:00]  Four fucking times they canceled.  And then the fifth time, Bonnie, I said, we're not going.  We're not going there.  We don't need to.  And the manager, come on, just give them one more.  So we go to the fucking meeting.  The kid is in the meeting, and she's showing her little arts and crafts.  It's so bad.  It's in the meeting?  Yes.  The kid's in the meeting.  They wouldn't let the kid...  They wouldn't...  Wow.  ...take the kid out of the meeting.  That's fucked.  Okay, so it's the head lady, the second...  What network?  Are you saying?  That sounds nice.  What network?  Head lady.  We network.  We.  Okay. 
[03:06:30]  Oh.  It's a head, the second...  Another one.  Another one, and the kid.  And so then the head of the meeting walks out, and the little kid says, you want to see  something uncomfortable?  I go, what, you got a videotape of this meeting?  All right.  Because it was the fucking...  Who brings her kid...  And she was just like, doing us a fucking favor.  The little kid?  No, the little kid.  Who fucking brings her kid to a fucking meeting and expects us to...  That's horrible.  It all of a sudden makes it unprofessional, and they're not taking you seriously. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, they're not paying attention.  They never asked to see us.  We never asked to see them.  How did that work out for you guys?  It was a preemptive strike.  We're here.  They fucking asked to see us.  We never said, oh, let's go pitch to WE Network.  What is WE?  I heard of it, but what is it?  It's a thinking man's logo.  It's the...  It's on the working man's...  Does W stand for women?  Yes.  It's a women network.  Women Entertainment or something? 
[03:07:30]  Like Lifetime.  Have you pitched for Oprah yet?  Her own network.  Yes.  Own.  That would be probably the hardest meeting to get.  That's got to be like a real...  Oh, I bet.  You have to be whatever, like presidential kind of meeting.  Well, what had to be hard was to get a show on Bravo when the head of the network was  putting on his own shows.  You know, we'd like to put you in, but there's another show going in that slot.  My show.  Oh, yeah?  Andy Cohen.  Yeah, he was the head and he gave himself...  I guess it would be hard not to get a show if you're the head of the network. 
[03:08:00]  He would put all his projects in.  He's right.  Oh, really?  But he bowed out now.  He's not the head of the network anymore.  He's trying to get in over there.  He's working his way.  No.  We'd love to be on Bravo.  Are you kidding me?  All the fucking people that watch Bravo?  Talking about TLC.  We'd love to be on anything.  Yeah.  We'd go back to We.  If the kid wasn't running back to We with the dumb kid.  We would take that meeting again.  We'd just bring our kid to play with our kid.  The kid has decided to pick you up.  He's got to run with it.  Yeah, that sounds like unprofessional.  It sounds horrible.  What are you going to do?  We get there.  Then the second meeting we had that day was great because it was guys. 
[03:08:30]  You can't have a good meeting with all ladies in the meeting.  Oh, damn.  You ask her, she'll tell you.  Bonnie, look out.  I refuse.  Misogynistic rich boss.  Yeah?  Starring him.  No, when we're at home and you've got your hands around my neck up against the wall.  Yeah, I agree with you.  Sexy.  Sexy.  Get out of here.  Why are you?  He just farted in her face.  He got up and bent all the way over.  Bent over.  Shove his ass in her face.  Sharted.  That is so. 
[03:09:00]  No, she knows.  There's some girl.  There's some ladies that get it.  Get us.  There's some.  What?  Fart humor?  When you're in a meeting when there's.  Yeah.  Did he do that in a meeting?  A lot of women don't like that.  Isn't that crazy?  Shove his ass in the child's face and fart.  You still do fart shit with your wife?  We love it.  Does she do it back?  We love it.  She does it all the time.  I never do.  You can tell she's sorry by the way she said I never do.  Give us one.  Give us one that she does.  I'll be laying in bed and she'll come and you know.  She'll fart on you? 
[03:09:30]  And hers are men.  She has men farts.  That's not a girl.  She's a man.  She's a man.  She's a man.  She's a man.  Is that why you dress like a boy?  To cover your man fart.  I think of Rich and I as buddies.  We're just Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer.  With different baby parts.  We don't like that.  Oh boy.  Back to the cream on the tattoos.  Dave, you've missed this all morning.  Is that something you've done in a meeting with execs?  I'm just going to cream my prison tat.  And women don't get it. 
[03:10:00]  But look how he caresses his own arm.  It's creepy.  Part of the character's lore is that he just keeps creaming his tattoos.  It's hilarious.  Oh, that sounds good.  I like that.  Are you running out of cream?  You're running out of cream?  I've got cream everywhere, baby.  That is really weird.  Look how he works his own arm, though.  You've got to do it nice and gentle.  You don't want to fucking...  Why don't you get on one of these tattoo ink shows?  Tattoo nightmares.  Actually, I got this one done.  Where?  On this one.  Was it the tattoo ink people? 
[03:10:30]  America's worst tattoos.  Oh, that's great.  They played that show how many times?  Oh my God.  Our neighbors who saw you on a tattoo show, and I was bamboozled to do it.  Oh, I hate the bamboozle.  I got to get a picture with Jay Peterman.  Can I just say this?  Yeah, go.  Get a picture.  I don't know if he's coming out yet.  What's happening?  I interviewed him on Later.  How was it?  He was very nice.  Was he nice?  Jay Peterman from Seinfeld.  Seinfeld.  Gray hair guy.  I don't know if you saw him.  We're looking to get him around the holidays like this.  I think he hosts a game show or are you used to it or something? 
[03:11:00]  I'm thinking of Jay Thomas, but it's a different Jay.  It's a completely different man.  Excuse me, I'm getting a call from the Canadian.  Jesus, he ran out for a picture.  I thought...  He really does, but he likes the Seinfeld people.  Oh.  We should just get him on and say hi, but...  I thought the things were going swimmingly.  Maybe he'll remember me.  Anyway.  He's going to walk in and go, oh, you're the one with the tilted...  Oh, wow.  Back to the tilted vagina. 
[03:11:30]  It's not a tilted vagina.  It's a tipped uterus.  She has a tipped uterus.  Did he get the picture?  Was he a nice guy?  Sure.  Oh, thank you.  Was it DJ?  Thank you.  Was it him?  Yeah, he's from Seinfeld.  Why didn't he ask him to come in?  He didn't give a fuck.  He's doing the after show.  Oh, good.  Sam Roberts.  Perfect.  Don't people know?  No, we don't care.  I'd rather have this than him.  I'd absolutely rather sit with you three than any real celebrity. 
[03:12:00]  We're not starstruck anymore.  We don't give a fuck.  Every once in a while we are, I guess.  Wasn't he on that show, Tom Hurt's show, right?  The Man of a Certain Eight?  What is it called?  I think he was, right?  Yeah.  I always get the name of Tom Hurt.  He was game show hosting, wasn't he?  He did Family Feud for a while.  He was a Family Feud guy.  Welcome to the Family Feud.  He did like that or something.  It wasn't like Richard Dawson, but it was pretty good.  But, of course, Seinfeld.  Yeah.  The biggie.  Who's the most starstruck, do you think, that came in?  Tyson was pretty big.  Who? 
[03:12:30]  Tyson.  Tyson.  When was he here?  The chicken guy.  Shut up, Anthony.  Yes.  Mike Tyson was just in here.  He's been in four times.  He does it regularly, you know.  He's been in a few times.  Yeah.  Who else starstruck us?  I don't know.  It's the A-lister guys.  Mostly, but it's people I see on TV, too.  Bourdain.  When we first had Shatner in, that was pretty cool.  I'm the only one who's going to mention it.  Captain Kirk.  Yeah, that was a great one.  Yeah.  Captain Kirk, man.  That's like, the guy's a fucking icon on television.  Yeah.  And movies.  And Price.  We had Hugh Jackman. 
[03:13:00]  Canadian.  That was pretty big.  Canadian.  He is Canadian.  I saw him doing some fucking show over the weekend.  He was doing this documentary for a space program, some mission to Mars thing.  And they tried to fit in so many Canadian aspects to it, but they always just had to go back  to NASA and all the leaps and bounds America had made.  It's that Canadian arm.  They love fucking, with the goddamn maple leaf on that fucking arm.  They love showing it.  Hey, it's our arm, eh?  Look, it can take off a toque.  Fucking crazy. 
[03:13:30]  That sounded like Dave.  But this is the thing.  He went to Vancouver.  He went to Vancouver.  He's watching, you know, Canadian television, Rich was, and he's saying, God, they love  talking about themselves.  And the Studies in Canada show.  You know, it's like, you're in Canada.  Right.  They do love talking about themselves.  What about America?  I mean, that's all the...  Well, they have these Canadian PSAs and stuff, and it's about how great Canada is, and how  America's stupid.  To prove your self-esteem.  Yes.  They're the dumbest things. 
[03:14:00]  There was one where this guy, this real raucous kind of asshole guy, it was supposed  to be the 1800s, and he comes riding up, and he's like, I'm American!  And the Canadian guy's like, hey, settle down, you know, this is our fucking shit here.  And he's reasonable, and the American was just the biggest asshole.  But that's how the rest of the world sees you.  Yes, I know!  And it was to make Canada feel good about themselves.  I find those things hilarious.  Yeah, they're like...  They're available on YouTube.  A Canadian invented basketball. 
[03:14:30]  They believe out that it happened in Massachusetts.  We were flying home from Canada, and there was 200 people waiting to get on a flight to  go and catch a boat and go on their cruise, on their big cruise, or one fucking trip all  year.  They were taking a boat to Cuba.  And the flight was canceled for bullshit, and the Canadian...  No one's yelling or pissed off.  Really?  They're like, hell.  They're like, oh, well.  Oh, what do we do?  Well, I guess that's that.  People are quoted as saying, I guess that's that. 
[03:15:00]  And, oh, well, maybe next time.  Oh, well.  And that's probably acting up.  Yeah, yeah, that's acting up.  Hey, settle down over there.  What do you mean?  Maybe next year we'll get a bumper crop, eh?  Be able to go again.  Yeah, meanwhile, America's like, they're five minutes late!  Fuck you!  We are entitled pricks.  We're out of our minds yelling, and they don't...  Mike, Mike, please. 
[03:15:30]  No, I said...  Go in the microphone.  I pointed with Mike, please, and he looks for Mike.  He turned around looking for, like, a guy named Mike.  No, microphone.  Hey, Canadian, they're just nice, pleasant people.  Yeah.  They are future people.  They really are.  Future people.  Like, once they've solved...  It's like in Star Trek.  Once we've solved racism and sexism, that's what we'll be them.  When it's like Vol is the god.  Yeah.  Vol put fruit on the trees.  Vol.  Yeah, and then all of a sudden, you know, they have to come down and, once again, not  fucking with the Prime Directive, they fuck with the Prime Directive and screw it all up. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  We had to.  We had to get involved.  Well, the one where it's, uh...  Where he went down to that Indian kind of village thing and became Kirok.  I am Kirok!  Behold!  Behold a god who bleeds!  Jesus.  That was great.  Am I supposed to say...  That's old, old Star Trek.  When Shatner comes in here, he, uh...  That's all I do.  And he gets so fucking annoyed.  Yeah.  He hates it.  He's like, I don't even know what you're talking about.  He doesn't even remember the episodes.  He goes, I don't remember what I did last week. 
[03:16:30]  What...  My favorite, though, is I did the, um, Rathakhan death of Spock through the glass here with  him on the other side, and he was just annoyed.  Yeah!  I was trying to get him to, you know, live long and prosper, and, you know...  You liked Star Trek?  You liked it?  I loved Star Trek.  Growing up, my life is horrible.  I haven't seen one Star Wars.  And you can tell because he calls it Star Trek.  And then it's like Star Trek and Star Wars.  You just don't like anything that shows technology or...  Intelligence.  You know, intelligence. 
[03:17:00]  You're a cool kid.  You didn't need all that stuff.  Right.  You're out there with the...  You watched it?  Star Trek?  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  What the...  He's got a cramp.  Yeah, you lost it.  You have a weak, restless leg.  Is it still going?  Oh, no.  It's gone.  Oh, I caught it.  I caught it before it started.  Before it started.  Your body is falling asleep.  Before it just totally pulls in.  Oh, I love that it pulls in.  You have to just grab your own calf muscle and scream in pain.  Make sure it doesn't go up your leg.  Yes.  But letting out that little, that little whispery, ooh, ah, ooh, ooh. 
[03:17:30]  That was good.  Something was up.  I thought his testosterone came back.  Yeah.  That's probably what's cramping up.  Oh, your muscles are all fucked up.  Talking about so boring.  You can put your leg to sleep.  You don't get restless leg.  Friday night, I was up in Massachusetts, and I did a show at, like, a Comic-Con up there.  It's called Mega.  It's called what?  It was Mega something.  Mega something.  But it was their Comic-Con.  Mega something.  Mega Comic-Con.  There are thousands of fucking people in this hotel that are so into this stuff. 
[03:18:00]  I mean, who was there?  Fucking costumes.  But who was there?  A lot of porn stars.  Oh.  And they have, like, you know, the guy that was on Ghostbusters.  The black guy?  Yeah.  He goes around all the time to those cons.  Yeah.  He just sits there at the table.  How degrading.  Elvira type, and Jenna Jameson was supposed to be there.  She canceled it.  Virgil from WWE.  All these weird celebrities are up there. 
[03:18:30]  And people are like, look at this, Rich Voss is here.  Oh, no.  People came up.  There are so many ONA fans at those things.  Of course.  It's Massachusetts.  Yeah, that's why.  Those things are so weird.  They put out a list of who's going to be there, and it's like, oh, this is Mary.  She was on episode 23 of The Twilight Zone.  You might remember she answered the phone in the diner.  And there's a line of people waiting to get a signature.  Barbara Eden was there.  Was she?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  She's great.  I don't think I saw her. 
[03:19:00]  I didn't see her.  Which one of the Doctor Who's was in there?  Yes.  Is it changing of the Who right now?  There's a changing of the Who.  E-Rock knows.  Yeah, E-Rock is all about Doctor Who.  Oh, boy.  I haven't been a big Doctor Who fan.  You haven't been into science fiction at all, Rich?  Doctor Who's from what?  From Dr. Seuss?  No, he's from Doctor Who.  I love it.  It's just so...  You don't even have to like Doctor Who or have watched an episode. 
[03:19:30]  You just know about it.  Yeah.  No, you just know it exists.  You must have been a very cool kid not to know any of this stuff.  I've never heard of Doctor Who.  I think there was a character in Doctor Seuss, Doctor Who.  No, it was Horton.  Here's a Who.  This is how stuff gets past him.  Last night, he goes, what's this?  What's this twerking?  Oh, my God.  Last night.  Last guy to know.  Yes.  Wow.  That thing is over.  That was a drug thing, I thought.  No.  That was twinking. 
[03:20:00]  That's some ass shit.  Twinking?  That sounds like something different.  Yeah.  That sounds delicious.  That's how you got drugs.  Twerking.  You didn't know about that.  Like, you're in your own little bubble of rich.  But he's online all the time.  How does he?  You would think you would know things like this.  Pop culture things.  You don't really know.  Some of it I do.  I know the dog's dead.  I'm a family guy.  All right.  How'd you know that?  How did that happen?  What happened?  He got run over by a car.  He was drawn dead. 
[03:20:30]  That's how it happened.  A lot of people are like, this is so tragic.  There's a petition being put out now by people that are like, you killed America's dog.  We grew up watching this dog for 15 years.  It's a fucking cartoon.  It's not a, he got hit by a car in the cartoon.  But why would they take him out of, what's the reason?  For publicity.  Why would they do that?  Of course they're just going to bring him back.  Stupid.  You think they're going to bring him back?  The dude on Boardwalk Empire doesn't get shot.  I hope they bring him back though as like a Frankenstein-y.  He'll be a ghost dog. 
[03:21:00]  The guy hasn't missed a shot in fucking four seasons on Boardwalk Empire.  Half-faced guy.  I haven't watched it.  You don't watch Boardwalk Empire?  I know I have to.  There's many shows that are marathon shows that I got to get on.  You don't watch the Americans?  No.  Oh my God.  Fuck this.  I got to go fucking meet with Barry.  Oh man.  Fucking Barry's here.  I just found out.  Oh wow.  Really?  All right.  I'm going to miss that meeting.  He's our Jew accountant.  He's as boring as they come.  I'm sorry.  That's really.  It's all right. 
[03:21:30]  No, it actually works pretty well.  It works in our favor because you don't want someone with a big personality if they're  looking after some of your cash.  Hey, I just want to say thank you guys for having me in, especially around the holiday  season.  Oh yeah.  It makes me feel good.  We always like spreading the joy of the O&A show for the holidays.

Thanks for having me guys. 
[03:22:00]  Bonnie, always a pleasure.  You should be coming in more too.  Bonnie, that's a cool look with the glasses.  You're coming in off.  That's sexy.  No, that's sexy's up the hat and the sweatshirt.  The glasses sexy it up?  Yeah, because it really adds the whole like just you don't give a fuck thing.  You're like a hot Snowden.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, that's good.  When was the last time you washed your hair?  Uh, last night.  No.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Just because she's wearing a hat.  I thought maybe she's had like.  But I do go sometimes, you know. 
[03:22:30]  I could go four days.  Dave, there he is.  Look at it.  I love to like sometimes.  I'm at Gotham this weekend.  I'm a mom.  I'm just.  I'm just.  Gotham.  Yeah, we know, Rich.  I'm going to get a mortal ink in two weeks and hi to my friend Roy in North Carolina.  Who's.  By the way, whining.  Whining out.  I'm a mom.  Isn't very sexy.  I'm a mom.  I know.  And she does it like she's a Jew.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  That must have been osmosis.  Thanks, guys.  Voss.  Gotham.  David Tell. 
[03:23:00]  Caroline.  Bonnie.  Nothing.  Nothing.  And of course, the podcast, which I truly love.  Thank you.  My wife hates me on Ridecast.  There better not be three of those.  Thanks, everybody.  Son of a bitch.  I got it.  I got it.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'll trade you live reads to go talk to that fucking guy.  I know.  It's up to you.  You want to make a deal?

The O.P. and Anthony Show is available later today with SiriusXM On Demand. 
[03:27:30]  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After O.P. and Anthony Live is coming up next!  This is After O.P. and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:28:00]  Jesus Christ.  866-WOW1-WOW is the number.  If you want to get in touch with us here at After O.P. and Anthony Live, and me, more specifically, Sam Roberts.  What a show!  Some of the funniest people in the country were just sitting in this studio, entertaining you. 
[03:28:30]  How lucky are we all to be in that presence?  I don't know.  You had Voss and Bonnie in here.  Dave Attell in here.  It's always fun as we lead up to vacation and watch the shows just become fun.  Not that the shows aren't usually fun, but just filling up the room with comics and or weirdos and watching the magic happen.  I can't wait until tomorrow.  Roland, you're the talent booker of the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:29:00]  Yes.  When they say no to, like, Oliver Stone, for instance, you're the guy, right?  Yeah.  You didn't sound enthusiastic with that, yeah.  Yeah, I have flashbacks.  When they say yes to people, you're the guy, too, right?  Yeah.  We're looking at a star-studded show tomorrow.  If I heard right, Colin Quinn and Bobo scheduled to be in studio tomorrow, is that right?  That is correct. 
[03:29:30]  That's huge.  That's huge.  That's got to earn you some points down the hall.  And the magician.  David Blaine?  No.  Just a magician?  Yeah.  And when we know, or?  I think so.  You think so or don't think so?  No, but a fool Bobo.  But a fool Bobo with his tricks.  Yeah.  I would love to see how Bobo reacts to magic.  I think that's a great booking, Roland.  That's a great booking.  Bobo would go, wow.  Should Bobo have to bring back the prosthetic ass?  That's true. 
[03:30:00]  We did.  I guess people, if you don't follow ONA Show on Twitter and Instagram, you didn't realize  Bobo was in last week.  That was last Friday, wasn't it?  Or was it two Fridays ago?  No, last Friday.  Last Friday.  They all blur together at this point.  Bobo was in last Friday with Eliza Schlesinger and Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve had brought in this giant prosthetic ass because he thought it would be fun for everybody  on the show to feel what it's like to give a prostate exam. 
[03:30:30]  I don't know why Dr. Steve wouldn't just do something for the show for once and bend  over.  Yeah.  Don't bring in a prosthetic.  Pull down your pants, bend over, and let us all feel what it's like for ourselves.  I got a finger up my ass.  You did?  By Dr. Steve.  How'd that go?  Well, that was a friend of 60 people on the bleachers.  Was it romantic?  No, it was awkward.  So you were like, yeah, Dr. Steve, take the prosthetic out of here, down with the pants.  How about we all just take turns putting fingers inside you?  Or Eliza could give him one. 
[03:31:00]  Whoever.  Whoever.  She's got nails, right?  Yeah.  It could work.  And then we just wait.  Is that supposed to feel like this?  We get to feel around in there, but he instead brought in a prosthetic.  And it was a big, heavy thing.  Like, it was a human-sized ass.  There was balls and a shaft under it for whatever reason.  I don't think that has anything to do.  In case you want to give a reach around.  And little moving parts so you could add in different prostates and touch it.  Dr. Steve donated it to the show after he was done on the air. 
[03:31:30]  And, I mean, we didn't have anything to do with it.  So, we sent it home with Bobo.  We told him to go home with it.  He was excited.  734, you're on after Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing there, Samuel?  Good.  I actually want to apologize for rolling for my call on Friday.  Good.  You know how I like apologies here.  Yeah, I'm sorry I showed any concern for your health, sir.  I'm sorry.  Oh, back to the health thing. 
[03:32:00]  If you want to.  Oh, boy.  No problem.  I hope you don't show during Thanksgiving, Mel.  Piece of shit.  What are you doing for Thanksgiving, Roland?  Staying away from people.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Are you doing the loner Thanksgiving?  That's fantastic.  You're just not going to, you're going to be off the grid.  Off the grid, watching football.  Lock yourself in your apartment.  Watching movies.  I'll walk around.  I'll get out.  You will?  You'll leave the apartment?  Yeah, I'll get on the bell.  But not with people?  Oh, hell no.  I'm good.  Thanksgiving is your day of rest. 
[03:32:30]  Thanksgiving is the day that you say, I'm thankful for Roland.  I'm thankful for myself.  And if you see people trip or struggling with something, I just go, they need someone to help them.  So you're thankful for people who are struggling because it brings you joy.  Yeah.  You know what that makes you, right?  A bad person.  Or an asshole, yeah.  Or an asshole.  You don't mind that.  I'll take the role as a pilgrim.  Eric.  Attacking the Indians.  You're going to try to conquer these people that are struggling.  Nah.  I just like watching these people.  Yeah.  You're far too lazy to be a pilgrim. 
[03:33:00]  You're just being a dude who just sits there and watch people.  I'll be an Indian lover.  I don't know.  Do you know what you're saying anymore?  No, I don't.  You don't.  An Indian lover?  Yeah.  You don't.  You just started saying words.  Just sit back, drink, watch football, and sleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all I care about.  Eric, what are you doing for the holidays?  Family.  Just for Thanksgiving.  What are you doing at?  Whose house are you doing it at?  At my aunt's house.  Oh, okay.  So it's your family.  Yeah.  And the wife's going?  Well, it's the wife's family.  So our family. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, so it's not your aunt.  It's your wife's aunt.  Yeah.  But at this point, you don't.  It's just everybody's every now.  No, it's not.  There's in-laws, and there's people who are your family.  You don't count your wife's family as a different family?  Nah, not anymore.  It's all one family.  Yeah, but don't you see.  So when you go see your wife's mom, are you like, oh, hey, mom, how's it going?  This is just like when I grew up.  I call her mom, yeah.  But you don't consider her your mother. 
[03:34:00]  No.  The relationship is different.  That's your mother-in-law.  To go to your wife's family's house is a big difference from going to your house.  If you go to your house, and it's your relatives, even if you don't see them that often, it's far more comfortable, because you can really be yourself and just be a complete waste of space.  Not you, Eric specifically, but the public you, but also you, Eric specifically.  That's horrible for you to say.  You can.  You have the option of being a complete waste of space if it's your family.  If it's your in-laws, even if you've been married for years, it's still your in-laws. 
[03:34:30]  You don't want to be a schmuck.  Yeah, you're still on.  You have to impress.  That's what I'm saying.  So there's a big difference from going to your aunt's house than going to your wife's aunt's house, correct?  That is correct.  Right.  What do you do to try to impress them?  Do you have to wear a nice red sweater?  Do you wear your cardigan?  I wear a golf shirt or a polo shirt or something like that.  Corduroy pants?  Do you wear corduroys?  No.  Penny loafers?  No.  Ew. 
[03:35:00]  I don't know how you dress.  No.  I have some black dress shoes.  Is it catered or no?  No.  People generally cook for themselves.  A lot of people get catered.  No.  A lot of people don't get catered.  Maybe in New York City or wherever.  You go to restaurant parties.  Those are catered.  But for the most part, Thanksgiving dinner is cooked by a family.  I don't know about that.  It's true.  So you're going to, you got to dress up though?  You got to wear nice grown-up shoes?  Church shoes? 
[03:35:30]  I have black dress shoes and I'll wear a nice shirt.  That's about it.  How often do you check to see if the dress clothes still fit?  Once in a while.  So do you ever get to the point where it's Thanksgiving and you're like, oh shit.  I should have checked before last year.  No, I used to have that issue.  I don't have that as much anymore.  You're not fluctuating as much?  No.  But I hate dress pants.  You never have to panic though.  Models is always open, my friends.  They don't sell dress anything.  No.  They sell those breakaway track pants that Roland loves. 
[03:36:00]  Well, yeah.  Well, his relative is Italian.  He can wear like the, it's like he's a...  Your mom.  Roland gets home from work and just rips his track pants off and then sits down on the couch in his underwear.  He doesn't wait until he gets home from work to rips his track pants off.  He sits there in the office after the show with his underpants on.  So why do you hate dress pants?  Itchy?  No, they're just not comfortable.  They're not me.  You look like management.  I just hate it.  Yeah, I would hate having to dress nicely for Thanksgiving. 
[03:36:30]  It's such a pain.  I always do it at my parents' house.  And that way you could just, like I said, I could just go and be an idiot.  I don't have to impress anybody.  I'll wear a fucking Yeezus t-shirt and a pair of jeans.  Eric's in-laws, after you're done eating, you go catch a movie in their theater.  You have a, your in-laws have a theater?  Yeah, they do.  What?  Yeah, Roland's been to that house.  Yeah, it's nice.  Whoa, your in-laws got some cash, huh?  They got a movie theater in their house.  It's too nice.  I hate Rich Marries Rich, doesn't it? 
[03:37:00]  Look at you.  They have an elevator in the house, too.  For what?  Are they handicapped?  No.  Just lazy.  Let's have it.  Just lazy.  They have like a chef's kitchen, like a legit chef's kitchen.  How many, how many?  They have the basement, and then they have the car garage basement, and...  Super nice.  Wait, car garage, basement?  I don't understand.  You, um, you can bring the cars in through the side of the house, and then go down, down  by the basement.  How big is this house?  Is this a hotel?  It's pretty big.  It's huge.  How many stories?  Uh, including basement, four. 
[03:37:30]  Four-story house?  How many people live there?  Two.  What the fuck do they do all day?  What do they need all those rooms for?  They work.  They own a corporation.  I have to say, though, their food spread is fucking unbelievable.  Do they enjoy their life?  And their food's delicious.  They have a, um, they have a custom-made bar, wet bar, where it's surrounded by a seawater  water tank.  Oh, my God.  It just seems so opulent.  It is.  But by that bar, they have, like, different meats and everything.  But then, do you have to be on your best...  Are they classy people, or are they, like, new money? 
[03:38:00]  Um, no, they're classy people, but then they'll sit there and they'll watch, like, Christmas  Vacation and love the shitter jokes.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you have to wait until they get a little intoxicated before you can feel free to let  the Nagel flag fly?  No.  I actually never drank around them.  How did that...  That's probably a good idea.  How did that family feel about you entering it?  As horrified as your wife felt about you entering her?  No.  That is horrible for you to say on all accounts.  You're right.  I shouldn't have. 
[03:38:30]  No.  They were fine with it.  They didn't mind you?  No.  They didn't say, who's this Nagel?  Nope.  How is your family fortune compared to that?  Um, it might be on par.  My dad doesn't tell me a lot of things.  He doesn't?  No.  He's not going to waste a whole bunch of money on an elevator, though.  There's a lot of secrets on my side.  I like that, though.  That's the way it's supposed to be.  I've met my dad many times.  Yeah, he's a good man.  He's a strong man.  He's like John Wayne, except filthy rich.  Doesn't look the part, though.  What do you mean?  He doesn't look like a... 
[03:39:00]  Doesn't look or dress the part.  No, he doesn't look hoity-toity.  You know what?  So he's in golf clothes.  Your dad's a smart man.  He likes golf.  He's going to spend his money on golf.  The rest of it goes into investments.  Let the money make money.  Yep.  He's not going to sit there and buy a seawater bar and a lazy person elevator.  Doesn't that make you just a lazy person if you have an elevator in your house  and you're not handicapped?  Oh, that's awesome.  Why is it?  No, because you're lazy, Rowan.  Yes.  Like, you would want an elevator in your apartment and you've only got the ones...  You're not even in a duplex. 
[03:39:30]  But it's a nice luxury.  Like, if it were up to you, you would have segues positioned at the doorway of every room  so you never actually had to move.  That's a dream, Sam.  I believe your guest is ready.  He is?  Yeah.  They're bringing him in right now.  Jay Peterman.  John O'Hurley's coming in here.  You all remember John O'Hurley from the show Seinfeld.  He now hosts the dog show that's on after the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.  He's got a new book out and everything.  Yes, Mr. O'Hurley can come on in. 
[03:40:00]  Hello, how are you?  Welcome.  We're live on the air already.  Are we?  Just waiting for you.  I'm live to tape.  You are.  You come live to tape.  I come with a delay.  That's how prepared you are.  John O'Hurley is here.  Welcome to the show, my friend.  Well, if you have cans on, I'm going to put them on, too.  Yeah, let's match.  Listen to that voice.  Now we have that similar look to it.  That is like a knife through smooth butter, that voice.  I have to tell you, I'm very envious of your voice.  Are you?  Of course.  You bolt upright in bed at night going,  Damn, I hate this voice. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Even in my dreams, it's a bad voice.  I just want to sit back and listen to it.  You know what happened to me?  Did you do Entertainment Weekly Radio while you were here?  I did.  They made me.  Okay.  That's part of my community service.  They forced you to.  Well, I'm sorry.  You could have talked to me over there, but here's what happened.  When they started this channel, I tried out for it.  Not to say that this is not better than Entertainment Weekly.  I'm not trying to downgrade my own show because I've built this up since then.  But here's what happened back then.  They're launching this channel. 
[03:41:00]  I'm like, yeah, I'll try out for the show.  And I did the demos.  And they loved them.  Right?  All the people around here loved them.  But there was one person.  And they said, these are better than anybody else's.  But there was one person who I guess was a higher up that said, you know what?  I can't stand the sound of that kid's voice.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, my goodness.  And I'm in radio.  I know.  You've got to live with this.  This is really, yeah, I know.  Wow, wow, wow.  So, to me, especially at that point when it was made clear, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  It's not the content of what you're saying.  It's not you as a person being a bad guy. 
[03:41:30]  It's just the audible sound.  I've had the same problem in radio.  I have never been able to secure anything permanent in radio because of my hair.  Yes.  Which, you know, that makes about as much sense.  Because when people listen to the radio, they want a nice personality.  They want somebody they can relate to.  And they do not want my hair.  No.  Yes.  You have a wonderful head of hair.  Some of it's real.  Don't downsell yourself.  When did you realize your voice was the stuff of legends? 
[03:42:00]  Well, thanks for the kind words.  You know what?  Let me tell you a little bit about my voice.  My voice was the last one to change in high school.  I mean, really.  Really?  I was well into my 16th year, and I had a squeaky little voice.  Did it sound like this?  No, no.  Much higher.  Oh, no.  It was in the soprano.  It was like male choir stuff.  Like you could try out for the school play, and they all thought you were a great singer,  but it was just because you were the only one whose voice.  I think what happened was, in the late 60s, which is when I was growing up in my early 
[03:42:30]  teens, all around cultural America was rock and roll, but it was controlled by the DJs  of these rock and roll stations.  Right.  That really, you know, we didn't have such a splintering of radio now.  So there were only a certain number of people that could be DJs, and they all had the same sound.  If you remember the old DJ sound, these great radios.  And so you grew up with these voices in your head, these big musical voices, and every  album ever recorded can be up here. 
[03:43:00]  You know, they had this, so they had these wonderful ranges.  And you're thinking about every word and the way it comes out.  Exactly right.  So I think I grew up with a lot of that psychologically in my head, so that as my voice developed, and  then I went into my minor in college, my major was in acting, my minor was in opera.  So I studied classically as a vocalist.  Wow.  But in studying classically as a vocalist, you're also studying the speaking voice, because  it's the same thing.  One is just sustaining tone longer than the other.  Do you think you did all that because you were emotionally scarred from having this voice 
[03:43:30]  that never changed in high school?  I think part of it was that.  Yeah.  Absolutely, yeah.  Yeah, you were like, well, now that it's changed, I'm going to value this.  I'm going to use it.  Yeah, we are the wounded kids, you and I.  Yeah, yeah, except mine is just still here.  Maybe I should have minored in opera or something.  You know, if you lived in L.A., we'd have a support group for you on Thursday nights.  We've got pretty much everything out there.  What did your parents think of you saying, yeah, I'm going to have this minor in opera,  and this is what I'm going to pursue?  Ah, they hated it.  They did.  Yeah, no support from the parents.  But that's all right.  You know, my father was a doctor, and my mother was in love with a doctor, and they had no experience 
[03:44:00]  in that.  And, you know, what they knew of entertainment, they read when they were in line at the grocery  store, and they picked up the Inquirer.  So it wasn't really something that they had, you know, touchy-feely on.  So it wasn't really something that...  But also, I didn't either.  I mean, I just knew I wanted to be an actor.  In fact, not that I wanted to be, I defined myself as an actor since I was three years  old.  Three?  Yeah.  Three years old, I knew what I wanted to do.  And people would say, what do you want to be when you grow up?  I'd put my hands on my hips with a sense of disgust that only a three-year-old can muster. 
[03:44:30]  And I would point to the black-and-white oval television set in the corner of the living  room, and I would say, well, I am an actor, so that's what I'm going to be.  I have to tell you, from probably the ages of, like, three until you actually get a  job as an actor, that seems very pretentious as a kid.  It kind of does, yeah.  As I say, it was a sense of disgust.  And I remember, actually, I'll tell you even a funnier story.  I was sitting at 10 years old having stole...  I stole our portable black-and-white television set that weighed 40 pounds and made it portable. 
[03:45:00]  Right.  And stuck it under my sheets every night with the little rabbit ears, and I would watch  the Johnny Carson show at 11.30 at night, and well past my bedtime at that age.  But I would watch it because it was my connection to entertainment.  All the great stars, and Johnny would talk to them, and they would have very funny stories.  But I remember getting up in bed, and I walked around the room with my hands again on my hips,  listening and saying, I don't have any stories to tell Johnny Carson.  And you were how old?  10 years old.  Okay.  And I was serious. 
[03:45:30]  I go, what am I going to tell him when I'm finally on the show?  The first time I was on The Tonight Show, Johnny had left, and it was Jay Leno.  And so Leno, during a commercial break, he turns over to me, because I had put one hand  on one side of the chair and one hand on the other.  And I was just looking forward, and he looks at me, he says, you okay?  And I look back at him, I said, oh, I'm fine, I'm just saying hello to a 10-year-old kid.  Yeah.  It's an amazing thing when that stuff starts to happen.  But when do you kind of realize that this is something that happens to people?  Because when you're a 10-year-old and you're watching this, and this is as big of a dream 
[03:46:00]  as you're describing, it seems as attainable as it is, it's a different world.  It's unattainable.  You know, I never realized that I couldn't.  I think one of the things that I've been lucky enough to have is always living with the power  of my imagination.  Yes.  And I do talk a lot about that now when I speak to other people about valuing what you  imagine rather than valuing what you think.  That your imagination doesn't lie to you.  It tells you really who you are and what you're capable of. 
[03:46:30]  Your mind will lie to you, and it has a different agenda.  It knows fear and everything else, but your imagination doesn't.  So I've always kind of lived with that as my guide.  And so I think in many respects that I could not get that daydream out of my head of what  I was going to do with my life.  So it was always my guiding force.  So it seems like you were kind of born with the mentality of like a motivational, power  of positive thinking type of speaker.  Very much so.  So is it hard for you to process when other people don't have that? 
[03:47:00]  Like, is it difficult for you to give advice when people say, well, I can't just not think  that, or I don't understand what you're talking about?  Well, I always believe that success is meant for the minority and not for the majority,  which is why it's called success.  Yeah.  And it will, that historically has always been that way.  I don't know that the nature of man is going to change, but there are just some people  that just decide to live by their imaginations, and they're no-limit people because of that.  They're no-limit soldiers, as Master P would say.  And if it was easy, everybody would do it. 
[03:47:30]  Right?  Exactly, yeah.  The wonderful line was that successful people just do the things that failures don't want  to do, and it's as simple and brutal as that.  That's good advice.  Now, when you, we should mention what you're here to talk about before we get into Seinfeld  and everything else, because there's so many things to talk to you about, Mr. O'Hurley.  But, of course, the dog show.  We're on Thanksgiving Day, once again, 12th year running.  It's the National Dog Show, presented by Purina.  It's the number one show on NBC.  Yeah, and it's an amazing thing that the dog show, I feel like the dog show started 
[03:48:00]  as people would notice it was on TV, because they had, everybody watches the parade, and  then they go back into the living room, and they're like, oh, what's this dog show on?  Yeah.  I think it started that way, because if you have, I mean, if you're sitting there with  the remote in your hand, and you start pressing it around, and all of a sudden you see a close-up  on a pair of dog eyes against a beautiful blue carpet, you're going to watch.  Right.  You're like, oh, what kind of dog is that?  And then you're watching two minutes, five minutes, ten minutes, and, you know, pretty  soon we've got you.  Yeah, when do you think it became like a thing where people are like, no, no, no, I watched 
[03:48:30]  the dog show every Thanksgiving?  Our first show in 2002 was, I think we had 19 million people.  Wow.  Yeah, we've grown since then.  I mean, it was a, it, it, uh...  So how many people watch this thing?  We have an audience now, we grew up about 13% last year, up over 21 million people.  That's good.  Yeah, it's an enormous undertaking, but it's an enormously successful thing for, uh, for  NBC.  And a perfect piece of programming, because if you think about it, following, what do you  put in that slot? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  And this was, they would scratch their hair for years trying to figure out what to put  in that two-hour slot that, that precedes football that comes off the parade.  And it's like, what is there that, you know, they used to run, you know, reruns of It's  a Wonderful Life and get a 1.3 rating, and they were happy with that.  Right.  But the dog show comes in, and all of a sudden it accelerates the ratings from the Macy's  parade and just gives a great lead-in now to football.  What does 21 million people translate to in ratings points?  Gosh, I don't know.  I honestly don't know.  Probably huge, though.  A lot more than 1.3. 
[03:49:30]  Yes, it does.  Significantly more.  Significantly more.  And it seems like it's the easiest, sort of, it's a family show without it being corny.  Something, you know, the nice, yeah, it's exactly right.  There's something for a two-year-old and a 92-year-old to watch.  And the nice thing is that there are 78 million dogs in this country, and we have 2,000 of the  best there in, with 175 different breeds, and each year we introduce more.  We're introducing three this year.  So there's something new and fun and exciting every year, and you get to, as my co-host David 
[03:50:00]  Frye says, you get to root for the alma mater factor.  The dog that is sitting next to you is the one that you're rooting for.  But that's why you like this dog show, too, because you're sitting there thinking, you  know what, success is meant for the minority, not only in human beings, but in dogs.  I like that top 2,000.  I'm not interested in the junkyard mutts that are sitting there watching their TV going,  how do I get to the dog show?  Well, it's funny, and that actually brings up the funny point, because I wrote, I've written  several bestsellers on the subject of dogs, but I have a new one out this year called 
[03:50:30]  The Perfect Dog, which I've written for children, and it answers the question that my son asked  me last year before the dog show.  He says, Daddy, is there a dog that's perfect?  And he was talking about Best in Show, and I said, well, so I wrote him in response to  that question.  I wrote him a Dr. Seuss-style poem called The Perfect Dog, and it introduces the question,  is there a dog that is perfect?  And I go through all of the elements that a dog, a perfect dog, would have, but then I  conclude with the phrase that the dog that is perfect is the one next to you.  There you go, because you can pet him, he's wagging his tail. 
[03:51:00]  That's exactly right, and it's your companion, and that's what dogs are.  They're our companions for life.  But the dog show gig has also got to be frustrating for you, because you're sitting there going,  there's 21 million people watching this.  I should be negotiating for a ridiculous fee.  And then NBC comes back to you and says, John, people are watching for the dogs.  All right?  Thank you for being my agent on this.  Because most of the time, you could be like, look at all these viewers I'm bringing in.  And NBC can easily say, no, what are you going to do?  Go host a cat show and see what happens. 
[03:51:30]  I promise you, they take very good care of me.  They do.  They take very good care of me.  Plus, you get to hang out with a bunch of dogs.  I'm pretty low maintenance.  Is hosting a game show, is it the easiest gig and show business, or is it more difficult  than we can possibly imagine?  You're talking about Family Feud.  Well, Family Feud, but you know what?  I also did To Tell the Truth.  That was my show.  To Tell the Truth?  I loved that show.  To Tell the Truth was, people ask me, what was your favorite experience in entertainment?  It was always To Tell the Truth.  It was.  Because it was a talk show that you played along with.  Yeah.  It was the perfect, and it was funny. 
[03:52:00]  And unfortunately, had the internet not grown and developed as it did, that show would probably  still be on the air.  But the internet just made all of the things that we talked about on To Tell the Truth kind  of secondary.  Right.  Because people already knew the answers to the story.  You know, interestingly enough, though, one of the people that I had on To Tell the Truth  was Sergei, who founded Google.  Really?  And nobody guessed his occupation.  Huh.  And now?  And now look who it is, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Did he give you any stock or anything from having him on? 
[03:52:30]  I looked at him, and I said, you know, someday, because I had known him before that, but  I said, you are going to be one of the wealthiest men in the world.  You said that to him?  Yeah, and intrinsically, he knew it, but it wasn't something that he had to say.  He was already aware of it.  But is it an easy gig?  Well, you know, is it easy?  No, it's actually very...  Even Family Feud.  Family Feud seems very extraordinarily easy.  Well, it isn't, because here's why.  You have nothing written.  There is no comedy written.  You're out there flying by the seat of your pants, hoping that you can be quick enough  to process the information that's in front of you to come up with a witty answer or something 
[03:53:00]  funny.  And that's what it is.  So you end up, every time you begin a show, you're really leaping and hoping the net will  appear.  Right.  And you have to trust that your mind is fast enough to pull your little database of one-liners  and what have you, or make something funny out of their comments.  So that makes the show difficult for the host.  But it's also very enjoyable, too, because I always looked at it as just, you know, it's  a cocktail party, and I just have two families that I'm going to have some fun with.  You just go hang out.  Plus, maybe you have a little drink before you go out there and loosen everything up. 
[03:53:30]  That doesn't loosen things up for me, no.  Makes regrettable choices that end up on television.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  When you get Seinfeld, and you get to be Jay Peterman, it was already a hit when they  brought you in, correct?  Oh, God, yes.  So is this like...  It was the number one show then, sure.  It's just the role of a lifetime, I would imagine.  You're like, they want me to be on Seinfeld?  Yeah, well, and originally I said no.  Why?  Because I was...  The dog show?  My series...  We hadn't even thought about a dog show then, no, but my series had been cancelled the day 
[03:54:00]  before by ABC.  It was called A Whole New Ball Game.  It was a comedy.  And I was crying in my beer that evening with my manager, trying to take the cancellation  as personally as I possibly could.  Of course.  And I got home that night, and Larry David's office had called and said, do you want to  come guest star over here on Seinfeld?  We have this really wacky role we think you'd be spot on for.  And I originally said, yeah, I don't think so.  I think we're still licking my wounds here over the cancellation of the show.  So I said, yeah, tell them thanks, but no.  I'm not a guest star. 
[03:54:30]  I do my own.  I'm sorry, I just didn't want to do one...  I was just not in a good frame of mind, anyway.  Which, by the way, gives me hope, because I also wanted to know if you've ever not been  in a good frame of mind.  You seem like an extraordinarily nice man.  I'm glad that there are some dark moments.  I allow myself 24 hours to mourn anything, and after that, that's it.  Good.  I get 24 hours.  Good.  My wife knows that as well.  I want to hang out with you during those 24 hours, personally.  That's what I would like to see.  But it's, yeah, so the next day I ended up going over to Seinfeld.  I did go, and the rest is history. 
[03:55:00]  And it was, they handed me the J. Peterman catalog, and they said, we just wanted to sound  the way this catalog is written, which if you go to jpeterman.com, you'll see the catalog  that we parodied.  And to me, it sounded like, oh, I guess a 40s radio drama combined with a little bit  of a bad Charles Kuralt.  So the cadence is you?  Oh, yeah.  I just created the character.  Oh, that's great.  And they loved it, obviously.  They had a great time with it.  And it gave the writers a chance to write these long, flowing, ridiculous monologues  that went nowhere. 
[03:55:30]  And the farther they didn't reach their destination, the farther the destination, and the more pointless  it was, the funnier it was.  Did you get to tell Jerry, listen, Jerry, do not end this show.  This is our gravy boat.  Jerry called me to tell me they were pulling the plug the day that I was, I was actually  at Best Buy that day, buying a refrigerator for the brand new home that I had closed on  the day before.  And he said, we're pulling the plug on the show. 
[03:56:00]  And I said, they will never find your body.  I'm putting it in this refrigerator.  Well, look, they are wrapping you up.  But you know what I found out about you?  Did you really, do you own Jay Peterman?  I own the Jay Peterman Company.  You bought the company after Seinfeld.  I liked the role so much, I bought the company.  After Seinfeld ended, they went into some financial difficulties.  And John Peterman, the owner of the company, came back and said, do you want to put the  company together under our parallel strengths?  And so to this day, since 99, I've owned the Jay Peterman Company with the real Jay Peterman. 
[03:56:30]  That's insane.  And is it doing better now?  We're doing fine.  We've been running successfully.  We do about 35 million a year.  Recognize this wallet?  Is that a Peterman wallet?  I swear to God, I've had this for a year now.  Look at that.  Jay Peterman is made out of catcher's mitt leather.  It's a fantastic wallet.  It's exactly what it's made of.  And some catcher is running around without a mitt.  But where are they?  Honey, have you seen my mitt?  All right.  I've got to plug your stuff.  And I want to plug your stuff, more importantly.  It's the perfect, the perfect dog is the book.  It is.  It's a kid's.  Pick it up on Amazon. 
[03:57:00]  It's great.  If you're looking for a great gift for your kids or kids that you have to buy for this  year, it's under 10 bucks.  Yeah.  It also includes a CD of me reading The Perfect Dog.  So if your child says, read it again, you don't have to.  Slip in the CD, and I'm there on an endless loop.  And I wish somebody had given me that CD as a child.  Maybe my voice would sound a little more pleasant to everybody listening.  And, of course, the dog show is on after the Macy's parade on Thursday.  So you're going to watch that anyway.  Thank you so much, John.  Great to be here. 
[03:57:30]  We're going to take a break, and we'll be back in a minute.  Thanks again.  The O&A Show continues sort of next.  This is After O&A Live.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  And now, After O&A Live continues.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Woo!  John O'Hurley.  What a delightful man. 
[03:58:00]  I don't even know why.  I mean, by the way, the dog show is on NBC.  I don't think I ever mentioned what channel it's on, but who's not going to watch that?  Red in Canada.  Hey, yeah.  I was actually kind of curious whether John has actually done any professional singing in his career with that voice.  Yeah, yeah.  Or your voice.  I'd rather listen to a dog scraping his ass across the carpet.  Well, I don't think that makes a sound.  Maybe the moaning that goes along with it.  But, yes.  If you actually want an answer to your question, he's done some Broadway work. 
[03:58:30]  However, I'm starting to think that the whole question was nothing more than a farce to get your joke in about my voice sounding like a dog's asshole on a carpet.  Thank you, Red.  Artie on Long Island.  Hey, how you doing, Sam?  Good, buddy.  Hey, Sam, listen.  I don't know how these assholes don't have you have your own show.  The last two interviews I heard from you were phenomenal.  Oh, gosh.  I couldn't get out of my car.  Thank you, man.  You kept me unbelievable.  And the last one with Hurley. 
[03:59:00]  Hey, I'll tell you, you're a talented guy, man.  The little mini, uh, Ben, uh, uh, Juan Bennington there.  Oh, thank you so much.  I appreciate the compliment, Artie.  You're welcome.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  I enjoy it.  Thanks.  Thank you very much.  John O'Hurley makes it easy, though.  You forget.  I mean, you just got to look into some of the stuff this guy has done.  And, uh, there's so much to talk to him about.  I could have easily spoken to him for the rest of the after show.  I thought I was going to.  I didn't realize that our time was so limited.  But, uh, but, yeah, he's a fascinating dude. 
[03:59:30]  Very, very, uh, very fun guest.  Speaking of guests, you know, uh, I was supposed to get Giovanni Ribisi, who I love for movies.  Boiler Room.  Boiler.  Do you love Boiler Room, Eric?  Of course.  Best.  One of, probably in my top ten movies of all time.  Yeah, and he was on Friends, but he was, uh, he was promoting the show Dads.  And I've said on Twitter that it.  What, that got canceled?  Well, that's the part.  Here's what happened.  It, Dads, it was not a good show.  It was Seth MacFarlane's live action show. 
[04:00:00]  And I watched it, and it was just, it was not my cup of tea.  Like, it was one of those, uh, shows where they were just, they were doing, uh, weed jokes.  Smoking weed jokes.  And just really laying everything on so thick, it was like, come on, a little subtlety, a little respect for me as a human being to be able to figure things out and process information.  But no, um, it wasn't a great show.  And I have them booked for an interview. 
[04:00:30]  And then Fox announces that they're putting the show Dads on hiatus.  So I'm sitting there going, oh, great.  I could talk to him about that, because I didn't know how I was going to talk to him about Dads without being like, ah, it's not a great show.  So, but then he cancels.  I guess because he doesn't want to talk about the show being on hiatus.  David in Ohio.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  So I'm bringing a little birthday today.  I want to call and tell you that, uh, you're spot on.  Uh, enjoy the voice and the personalities like you bring in. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, gosh, thanks.  Well, yeah, I'm on the road.  Like, I can't cancel my serious subscription, even though I'm frustrated.  I know ONA are frustrated.  But, uh, I need to get a morning fix from you guys.  Look, I'm going to tell you something.  ONA talk about people, uh, canceling subscriptions.  ONA talk about leaving the platform.  That's ONA.  I'm going to tell you from Sam Roberts, who does not have any fuck you money whatsoever.  I don't even have, I don't even have toodaloo money.  I don't even have a polite goodbye money. 
[04:01:30]  I have money, uh, to pay for this month's rent, and that about covers it.  I plan on being on SiriusXM for quite some time.  I think the service is phenomenal, and I hope everybody subscribes and tells their friends  to subscribe.  Ah, glad to hear it, brother.  Hey, I was, uh, seeing if you and Roland, uh, or just you, uh, could hook a brother up  on his birthday with some, uh, Yeezus handouts or maybe a DVD or something.  I don't have any Yeezus stuff, but I can, uh, I'll send you a copy.  We, uh, what do you like, uh, comedy, horror? 
[04:02:00]  I got all these DVDs.  All right, I'll send you a copy of, uh, We're the Millers on Blu-ray.  All right.  All right, that's that Jennifer Aniston movie.  So I'm going to put you on hold.  Somebody's going to take your address.  Happy birthday.  And we go to Izzo in New Jersey.  Hey, Sam.  What's going on?  How you doing?  Hey, you brought up, uh, Master P and No Limits.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, I did.  And, uh, I know this goes back to, uh, Monday's show, but yesterday I wanted to call in and  you, uh, you were talking to Mike.  But, um, another song for Anthony I think that you guys could look into with the N-word is 
[04:02:30]  Down For My Niggas by, uh, C Murder.  Look, I mean, one of these days we'll really get deep into it because there are a lot,  especially now, there seems to be this whole thing going on, thank you, Izzo, in hip-hop  music that is completely, uh, opposite from what's going on in the media where everyone  on the news is waiting for anybody to say or do anything even remotely racial so they 
[04:03:00]  can pounce on it so they can attack them so they can tell them how bad they are as human  beings.  On the other end of the spectrum, in hip-hop, there's this whole group of artists that are  just like, let's see how much N-word we can fit into any given song.  And it's not like it's an underground group of artists.  It's the big songs.  Jay-Z is putting out songs just flooded with the N-word.  And like you heard yesterday on Opie and Anthony, YG is flooding songs with N-words. 
[04:03:30]  And it's really weird that the media is kind of just waiting until somebody says it in speech  or, or somebody says it, I guess, in an arena where they're not supposed to say it.  Because so many people go on television and they say the N-word is never appropriate, it  should, uh, never be used, it should, blah, blah, blah.  They do the Brian Gumbel speech, where it's an outrage whenever that word is brought up  from whoever. 
[04:04:00]  But they never mention any of these rap songs where it's been there for, you know, years  they've been doing this.  And it's only more, it's more now.  They're absolutely using the word more now than they've ever used it.  Like, I don't even know if I'm supposed to be playing this song.  And we play this song on SiriusXM.  And this is an XL channel.  But I don't want anybody to attribute those words to me  and say nobody should use it at any time. 
[04:04:30]  So I go, why don't you talk to the guy who said them and recorded them  and made a hit single out of it?  I guess that these news cycles just have so much time to fill  because there's so many news channels  and they always need to get the scandal going  and they need to have the outrage  that they're just waiting for somebody to make the slightest mistake  and hoping that they can blow it up into a national scandal  that people will just leave the news on for  as opposed to actually reporting news. 
[04:05:00]  You love this song, Eric?  It works.  It's catchy.  It's better than Drake.  You like this song better than any Drake songs?  What was the Drake one that we...  Oh, um...  His version of...  Started at the bottom, now we're here.  That's his song.  What do you mean his version of it?  There's only one version of it.  The dirty version, as they call it.  The XL version.  I like this one better. 
[04:05:30]  They're both catchy songs.  But it's also great because, you know,  white kids love hip-hop.  And so...  Huh?  Get out.  Yes.  Yes.  Is this a trend?  It's starting to become a trend.  Wow.  And I blame that Marshall Mathers, that Eminem guy.  But it's making a generation of kids be okay with it.  And the kids use it.  And O&A have brought that up  and other people have brought it up.  Especially in urban areas.  Huh? 
[04:06:00]  What'd you say, Roland?  I like to do it like this.  Oh.  Somebody just walked in.  Kids will use it.  But then I guess they reach a certain age.  Maybe 18.  Where they're no longer allowed to use it.  And it just becomes confusion.  I think everybody...  It's okay to be offended by it.  I don't mind when people are offended by that word.  The problem is...  Having to make rules and laws.  And everyone has to agree with me. 
[04:06:30]  And everything has to be okay.  And blah, blah, blah.  Like...  If you could just decide...  Yeah, I don't like that word.  Even if you say,  I don't like anybody who uses that word.  That's fine.  You don't have to like them.  But if it's okay with you,  I'm gonna probably define my life on my own terms.  And just move on.  Because I'm not sensitive about any words.  But I feel like,  Uh-oh, I don't want to bother anybody.  Because I could be the next story.  They're just waiting.  Look.  I gotta tell you something. 
[04:07:00]  Kanye West just walked in.  That's why Roller was making a...  Kanye West wave to you?  Yeezus himself?  What's Kanye West doing here?  He's going to all the hip-hop stations.  And I'm gonna tell you this.  You all heard me with John O'Hurley.  Imagine if I was actually a die-hard John O'Hurley fan.  I'm gonna tell you,  there's nobody in this building  that would do a better Kanye West interview than me.  Um, I would,  because I went to see him.  Roller, nobody even knows what you're saying.  I would say Kanye?  I don't even know what you just said just now.  Well, Kanye would. 
[04:07:30]  No, he wouldn't.  I was very confused at your concert.  Eric, do you think anybody here  would do a better Kanye West interview than me?  What about the morning mash?  No!  They're included.  They're included.  They would do a terrible Kanye West interview.  Terrible.  If Nicole wants to do a good Kanye West interview,  she's gonna have to sit in here with me.  But he's only doing hip-hop stations  because they play his music.  Um, listen.  The reason you're gonna hate Steven Singer  comes in many colors this holiday season.
