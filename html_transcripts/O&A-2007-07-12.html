<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts recounting their previous day's activities: a successful book signing for Jim Norton (allegedly outdrawing Sylvester Stallone), followed by a visit to a strip club, Cheerleaders, and a discussion on the relative merits of different strippers, with a particularly negative opinion voiced towards Russian strippers.  In-studio guest Ian then detailed a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chest, describing the injury and its location.

The show continued with the ongoing "strangest/wildest/craziest thing you own" contest, featuring entries like Elvis's hair (unverified), a porcupine foot, a stab wound from a bet gone wrong, an Asian longhorn beetle, a 1950s portable car urinal, a boss's severed fingertip, breast implant drain tubes, salivary gland stones, a large swollen testicle, and an Iraqi dagger.  Graphic descriptions of these items accompanied jokes about the Holocaust and Puerto Ricans. A female listener, contacted via video feed, engaged in sexually suggestive banter and revealed her lingerie-filled MySpace page.  Comedians Danny Ozark, Gino Biscotti, Ed McGonigle, and Brendan Kennedy performed stand-up routines as part of a 42-inch plasma TV contest, with Ed McGonigle winning a spot on the Opie and Anthony traveling comedy show.  Kid Chris and Jimmy Norton were present throughout this segment.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to "Perv News," focusing on the arrest of a New Jersey lawyer for indecent exposure and a teenager arrested for breaking into a neighbor's house to watch pornography.  The hosts discussed these events extensively.  This was followed by a comedy contest to determine an opening act for their "On A Traveling Virus" tour.  Little Jimmy Norton and Kid Chris were in the studio, along with comedians Joseph Griglio, Benny Michaels (who made jokes about race and his wife's drinking habits), the Tickle Finger Death Squad (a musical act), and Ed McGonigle (who told jokes about various controversial topics).  The contest included a "speed round" for the top contenders.

The show also featured "Phone Call Thursday," where many callers simply stated it was "Phone Call Thursday."  Other segments included listener calls, discussions about listener-submitted items for the "strangest thing you own" contest,  a discussion about a listener's dog receiving a year's supply of Viagra, and a mention of a comedy show opportunity for an amateur comedian to open for Jim Norton.  Another guest was a man who was stabbed by his ex-girlfriend with a pen.  Further discussions covered Michael Savage's upcoming book mentioning Opie and Anthony, their own upcoming book ("The Opie and Anthony Experience!"), and their upcoming show in Mansfield, MA.  A segment featured a bizarre challenge:  guest Twitchels was offered escalating sums of money (eventually over $500, plus a George Foreman grill) to lick cake off Duffy's exceptionally large testicles, which were graphically described and compared to various objects.  Much discussion ensued about the act's implications and its comedic/monetary nature. Twitchels ultimately completed the challenge.  The show concluded with clips of a post-show tongue scraping and the subsequent smearing of the scrapings on a man's face, along with numerous sponsor plugs and further sexually suggestive banter.

[00:02:30]  uh we outdrew stallone in philly it was the uh the biggest one they've had there the biggest one  they've had at this philly barnes and they also said that stallone was an ass they did say that yes  he showed up 45 minutes late yeah yeah i don't take pictures i don't take pictures with anybody  did he say that what yeah yeah yeah yeah he wasn't taking pictures probably like if some  buxom bodacious blonde bimbo came up he'd probably take a shot with uh her but

[00:03:30]  dude that shot himself does anyone know the story of this guy yes he wanted us he wanted i misspelled  his name on the book he just couldn't handle it you know the way you did put that sounded like  he shot himself at the book signing all right well you know keep him guessing that's what you learn uh  when you do this stuff you want to get a buzz going on a book kill yourself at a signing i would  appreciate any fan that did it i mean things are going badly but the guy was bragging about like gunshot 
[00:04:00]  wounds all over his chest and uh and he said yeah back in the day i don't know how many years ago he  decided to kill himself and uh take a gun to the chest and uh he survived it he like and he's in  like perfect shape now with these like crazy gunshot wounds yeah it didn't seem like he really put the  gun somewhere i mean the chest is the chest but it wasn't like right there on that in the oil pump  you know he kind of had it on the the right side to the side and it was down a little bit i'm not

[01:25:00]  michael j fox a lot more entertaining when he's shaking because i i didn't like family ties or back  to the future but when he's on there doing that hippity hop i can't change the channel  i i read where hillary clinton and barack obama might run together as a ticket yeah a black guy  and a white woman personally i'm still getting used to it at the mall  i might be old-fashioned who knows you know i read where an 18 year old boy got kicked out of 
[01:25:30]  boy scouts because they discovered that he was gay now if you're 18 years old and you're still in  the boy scouts nobody needs to discover that you're gay that's what they call an open and shut case  you don't have to call in colombo on that one uh i i was reading an article about all the uh profiling  going on at airports personally there's two things i hate to see in an airport profiling and arabs  i don't think either one of them belong there really i heard when they were talking about a 
[01:26:00]  four dollar a pack tax on every bag of cigarettes four dollars you ever think you see the day when  buying a dime bag would be a cost cutting measure but i actually saw a report on tv where they said  the farmers are making more money selling marijuana than they are selling corn and i wasn't that shocked  because i've had corn and i've also had marijuana and there's almost no comparison between the two 
[01:26:30]  i mean you and your friends sit down and watch scarface with a plate full of corn  not going to be as good a movie i mean guys have a real hard time getting women to hang out with  you because you're holding good corn i wouldn't recommend it as a battle plan but i can't believe  all the clothing the young girls are wearing nowadays you know the massive amounts of cleavage the  hand tops the low rider jeans that almost show off the crack i mean isn't it freaking awesome isn't  isn't like the greatest thing ever i mean you know my motto why buy porno when your neighbors have

[01:45:00]  whatever man  i'd expect anything out of this look at me look like a date rapist from the lifetime channel  right that's okay i heard every man's potential attacker you believe that  no you traitor not every man's a potential attacker you know how many women i see in my  day-to-day life that are not potential victims you got a mustache a toe ring and you're riding the bus  i don't think anybody's looking for you honey 
[01:45:30]  we gotta bring this concept to comedy  how many clubs how great would this be you always think you're gonna slip something in  their drink right honey let me tell you the only thing i put in that girl's drink was an altoid for  the stank breath whore nobody's touching her with that breath i don't care if they play lacrosse for  duke it ain't happening oh thank you oh no i want to keep it going for chris can i can i give chris it  didn't matter if the lowercase g was cursive as long as it's a lowercase g 
[01:46:00]  he took notes on it oh yes jimmy's taking this very seriously jimmy's critiquing this is a very  important spot on our tour but i want to point out the fact the break this show gives on rape jokes  it's like if if if you're on the rape theme we want so badly for you to succeed no that won't get  crashed you won't get crashed if we think you might be on the right track  it's terrible hey why don't we do one more there uh than sure let's give a big warm welcome to danny 
[01:46:30]  ozark oh all right yeah yep can chris knows him yes yes okay yes uh good news from the world of  sports the nhl is actually reaching out to the african-american community they want to make the  sport more appealing to blacks so they've parted up with mitchell and ness local manufacturer of throwback  jerseys i actually have my own ideas how hockey can make itself more appealing to african-americans  first thing i do is put bars in the penalty box 
[01:47:00]  it's okay my boyfriend's black don't worry about  next thing i do is let them use the zamboni machine for drive-bys because with that kind of aim but  overall i don't think overall i really don't think that hockey is ever going to be something that's  appealing to african-americans because in hockey success is dependent upon achieving goals and um  i've been going to the movies a lot lately but it's been disappointing because movies are never 
[01:47:30]  about what i think they're going to be about based upon the title like i went to see the forgotten  but i didn't like that because it wasn't about how ronald reagan referred to the first 75 years of his  life but the worst was when i went to catch that kid okay because that wasn't about eric clapton's  son thanks a lot there's a story with danny ozark too he's uh yeah yeah big into the trannies he uh  recently was uh invited to a local anchor's house uh the house sitter was uh having a party and he went 
[01:48:00]  over and went through the lady's panty drawer and uh then the news found out about it and went to his  house and went through his bedroom and all that stuff it was pretty crazy wow wee you're a wild  man he's a rapist for real i like this kid even even though it was some of the jokes were okay needed  work i liked like the fact that he just plowed through with the racist angle i thought was a  showed a little stick to it of this mr ozark well i like to give treats to um black guys so yeah he'll 
[01:48:30]  like compelled and i was oh you're gay yeah well bisexual i was raped by a black guy when i lived  out in vegas all right well way to deal with it just give them all some yeah  just concede hey now what would you do if you got food poisoning just eat the same thing for the  rest of your life true that true that but um no i just i also get a lot of chicks too so it's all  good he's big into trannies big who's your favorite tranny superstar uh just like real ones um  what's that girl uh gia darling maybe but um yes uh uh yes of course she lives in southern 
[01:49:00]  california she's got her own films transsexual superstar she's old hat go ahead what do you  got her training card no no no we've just uh yeah you get the rookie card it's a boy  when i lived in vegas um i dealt with a lot of like really hot um transsexuals and some of them  were good enough to like work in strip clubs like they would fool the people there that hired so

[02:05:30]  how about one joke is that that's a little too brief yeah yeah how about one minute each then  one minute each okay fair enough all right so can we get uh the four people i mentioned up here  please ed gino brendan and uh danny ozark wow these guys are running out of steam but they're tired  they're not used to the morning sitting there and laughing all right let's hear for your first uh  finalist ed mcgonigal all right here goes ed he's all four ten of them four eleven 
[02:06:00]  yeah i saw a commercial where they said there's nothing funny about drunk driving and that's not  really true because if you don't get caught it's funny i mean come on you're high-fiving your  friends you're laughing at the cops i don't know i don't know where these buzz kills live but if you  get loaded and make it home it's freaking hilarious i mean come on i keep hearing people always say tiger  woods doesn't act very black i'm sure you've heard that i disagree he dominates the sport and he has a 
[02:06:30]  hot white wife that's what black is against i mean come on what is what you want you want the poor  guy to bust a cab in somebody i mean come on and then there was a shooting over germany a high  school shooting and a woman who lived nearby said i can't believe anything this violent could happen  in germany can't believe because as we all know nothing violent has ever happened in germany  apparently this woman's cable system doesn't carry the history channel you know a couple of  a couple of big events you missed hearing about you know violence in germany the next thing 
[02:07:00]  you're trying to tell me there's body odor in france nice not a not a particularly strong last  joke but the rest of it was still very good all right yeah let's go we're running out of show here  all right cool that was ed now it's here for gino  the fan just wants out of that room here comes stop all right people hi it's good to see you again again  i'm here for you this isn't what i do for fun if i want to have fun i'll sit on the subway reading 
[02:07:30]  the diary of anne frank and then i'll slam it on the ground and scream what is taking the freaking  german so long right she's in the attic colonel clink okay this could have been a short story the  black guy's like oh i get this bit off now look then you get all these uptight people are like oh  don't make fun of the holocaust it could happen again the holocaust could not happen again not with  these gas prices am i right because  and who's going to kill an entire race of people when you can sell them on ebay eyes up here honey 
[02:08:00]  but then you get these politically correct people oh we got to get rid of guns guns kill people guns  don't kill people puerto ricans kill people right and i shouldn't make fun because puerto rico did  great in the olympics they went home with five medals in landscaping but i will tell you  you i'll end on that there you go all right gino gino visconce moving right along 
[02:08:30]  go ahead pan hurry okay cool let's hear it for uh danny ozark  yes yes uh madonna has a new children's book out now it's actually her fifth personally i think  she's running out of ideas like now she's just putting her spin on some popular children's tales of the  past like for instance in madonna's new children's book little red riding hood that's about her  clitoris  and also also in madonna's new children's book the abcs that's about all the various forms of 
[02:09:00]  hepatitis you can get if you have sex with her so it's an important read for the entire family  we just had july 4th my favorite holiday though is actually ash wednesday because that's the one day  year when aaron neville looks normal and i think that i'll wrap it up with this the harlem globetrotters  are touring u.s military bases all across the world in an effort to boost morale with the troops  i actually think that's a good thing because now the globetrotters get to hang around other people  that didn't get drafted so it's all a good thing for everybody thanks a lot thank you all right 
[02:09:30]  danny ozark everybody moving right along right yeah all right next the final finalist brandon kennedy  yeah i think uh i think i have a problem i think most guys can relate to me on this but  don't you guys hate it when you're at a urinal in a public bathroom and somebody comes up to the  stall right next to you and then you gotta stop checking for crabs oh man oh man i don't know i think 
[02:10:00]  about a lot of dumb stuff like i was thinking the other day about thongs and uh to me a thong  says i don't really want to wear underwear but my genitals are just too darn sloppy to be trusted  to pants alone i don't know before i get out of here though obviously my hair is a little long i  need a haircut and i saw a sign there and it was great it said two dollar haircuts i was psyched you  know because like the last time they gave out haircuts that cheap you to get numbers tattooed on  your arm first thank you i'm out wow i'm noticing a lot of nazi jokes making their way in all right

[02:26:30]  thing at first did your father leave her oh yeah she has a fear of abandonment then that's why she  cuts the feet off so the thing can't run away wow you're good jimmy jimmy analyzed uh the mother  why aren't you past secrets with stuff like that i don't know brilliant i thought it was i thought this  would be something good to win until i saw the 40 guys out there so i don't know hey that's pretty  good though man it got you on the air you want to say hi to anybody in philly or what yeah my boy mike  wagner from jw bruschette carpet oh yeah yeah put it in play yeah how about that porcupine in the 
[02:27:00]  wheelchair uh also you guys had on the guy the other uh a little bit ago got shot little chest yeah yeah  so i figured i'd tell a story actually okay chris is here which is perfect because i want to get into the  the mutilation thing he's got i got stabbed in my thigh right here oh god and i got scored  holy cow not only that they were nice oh my god what is that they gave me beauty mark on the other  leg too hold on we gotta explain this for everybody what did you do a coke dealer wrong no no no what's 
[02:27:30]  that who you hanging out it's a very very bad bet going wrong jimmy explain what we're looking at  please um well jason uh has uh on his right leg he's lifting his uh tacky shorts all the way up to his  like to wait like above where his thigh is yeah it's where your thigh meets your groin and he has  a stab wound it goes all the way from the top of the thigh and the groin all the way down to the  middle of his knee and then continues on the calf like they stopped got something to eat and came  back and continued stabbing him on the other side is like they hit this side too they hit the other 
[02:28:00]  side completely this has got to be some kind of surgery you didn't get stabbed this is a car accident  surgery wound itself is just this right here oh it's a two inch mark what happened was he severed my  artery and it was like the movies you know you see that arterial spray yeah well it was spraying  out wow you know i was done i don't know how i'm even standing here today and then the other leg what  they had to do was they had to take a vein from this leg put it over here as my artery you know okay  so one stab wound severed the artery and it caused all that scarring yeah i did my last surgery was just 
[02:28:30]  in april uh it's been a year what was the what was the uh bet gone wrong or did you say hey mom i'm going  to college i was going to move out you know you know 27 was time for me to leave so mom you know  she wanted to cut my leg off i didn't take a joke repeated  drinking actually my boss did this to me we had made bets and we made a bet in mexico that he can 
[02:29:00]  throw this knife and stick it into a wall well i lost 150 on this one bet so we're at a restaurant  he pulls out the steak knife things 12 inches long rounded tips rated edge he bets me from 10 feet he  can throw and make it stick in my leg we get home a couple hours later this is after 12 hours of  drinking he changes the i owed him eight thousand dollars i borrowed previously eight thousand thousand  dollars for what well just you know months just borrowing money you know no no that doesn't cover 
[02:29:30]  it just borrowing money what did you borrow eight grand for sale so it's a commission-based job right  so if you don't sell you don't get commission sometimes you go a month or two with no money so  just over the couple months pay the bills and you know whatnot i got up to eight grand i ran i ran it  up to eight grand well how bad a salesman were you you know really bad this went downhill  what's that that's i did sell mortgages it wasn't a good time i borrowed some money so he ended up  betting me eight thousand dollars you throw this knife when we got home he changed it into he i said 
[02:30:00]  i could stick it in your leg obviously i said look this bet's off you're crazy and uh he wouldn't let  me go he was just like listen you know you made a bet you owe me eight thousand dollars now you owe me 16  grand and i was drunk i was like yes the hell i do i pulled my pants down i said you're gonna have to stab me  i picked up the knife without hesitating stabbed me right in my leg that sounds like a healthy uh  boss worker relationship yeah wow and he got you right in the uh right in your femoral artery you 
[02:30:30]  know people say half inch this way would have been dead half inch i would have got two stitches been  done hit me right there perfect spot severed a clean right in the middle just sue him i'm in the  process insurance company you know a good i would hope so you call the cops absolutely yeah it was  it was more like an accident it wasn't no he picked up a knife and stabbed you that wasn't a mistake  he wasn't handing it to you you know so you know what that meant i don't either oh yeah keep it on  keep it on the qt yeah yeah i just put it on place on the radio pending litigation oh okay well no one 
[02:31:00]  will hear this you know but that's just that's the way it went you know somebody's got to pay yeah  absolutely okay i'm gonna hit a million in bills so cool what do you think about the porcupine  footage i say after porch can i just get a tv yeah chris do i can i can i get it on that i mean  is that mutilation yeah that's mutilation yeah oh hell yeah doing a mutilation uh contest yes for a  thousand bucks i could use that then then we could hire you here to sell things because you're obviously 
[02:31:30]  very good salesman i'm back on track i'm making the money you know why they have to take the vein  out of the other leg though if why can they just sew up the uh artery and you would think they'd do  a better job taking it out i mean that was like we need 18 feet of vein yeah and they pulled it out  of them what kind of insurance did you have ted's of philly what happened was they put in a fake  artery it was a tube and and there was no circulation so my toes were turning like black you know there's no 
[02:32:00]  blood getting down because instead of you know the compression from the flex in the vein it wasn't  going it was just kind of basically dripping through so they had to take the vein out to make it  natural so it would give me the circulation you know down into my toes but why such a long he started  right up at the top jesus and he had to follow it exactly where it goes so he could clip it because  it's the entire side size of my thigh over here were you unconscious for that operation no oh man  no i said were you unconscious oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah no i wasn't oh no general anesthesia on 
[02:32:30]  that one it's a local we use a local on that all right well  we're in the lead right now yeah right now you're in the lead with the porcupine foot oh yeah above the  eldest hair yeah he barely got off better than the porcupine yeah right thanks fellas i appreciate it  all right stick around we may have a prize for you that would be all i wouldn't bet on it but it's  possible i'm not going to make any bets in a plasma tv 42 inch all right what do we got next steve we

[02:33:30]  around september 11th i thought ant might like being a big world war ii fan obviously the other  side though my in-laws made me take it down because they they thought it was offensive but  can you stop shaking so we can read the poster what's it say oh my god let's talk about sacrifice  it's a lady with a hat yeah babushka right i think it's like a russian yeah it's kind of russian uh  propaganda let's talk about sacrifice and what's it say underneath well i thought it was a little  better than elvis's hair so i didn't know a guy was gonna have a porcupine foot in a stab wound next 
[02:34:00]  by war bonds by war bonds oh that's an old poster topical yeah it certainly is here's your bug  hey i hope you say does somebody have anything crazier than that like maybe a little a little globe with  figures that you're shaking it snows i hope a drunk driver paralyzes you why the anger because  that awful thing you brought in like it was unique you're number eight on amazon jimmy no anger i'm  number seven but after i pass secrets i've got a secret my book sucks we still don't even know what 
[02:34:30]  that book's about it stinks whatever it is all right let's go this is uh michael hi how you doing all  right i got this uh nice 1950s portable urinal for your car oh wow here no stop messy leaks in your  car messy leaks it's one of those auto johns auto john never seen one before i found in my basement  yesterday look how happy the cartoon character guy is he's fantastic box he is just smiling yeah joe  businessman taking a leak while he's driving oh sticky but yeah oh would your dad use it or something 
[02:35:00]  i think so he must have oof drink some beer out of that yeah oh yeah do i get the tv if i don't  no shots i get some beer it's it's a great invention yeah it's just uh wow it's a plastic bottle more  impressive it is pretty sticky they were really oh god dad was doing something else 
[02:35:30]  mommy wasn't taking care of i guess the helmets were a lot bigger back then  jesus look at the size of that bell damn evolution yeah oh god i think daddy hooked  up the vacuum cleaner to the other end of that ed jump in there and take a bath  ed's feeling good about himself see these guys march in right ed all right well all right well  all right you're in the running if the porcupine foot catches fire stick around with that all very good 
[02:36:00]  you know that's what it reminded me of when uh that guy passed around the bug uh jimmy looked at  it like hyman roth looked at the gold telephone at the meeting in cuba barely even gave it a passing  glance take it away pass it around let everybody be disgusted by it oh wait we might have something  good here steve this is good this is uh tom hey tom what's up howdy um i have the fingertip of my boss  uh-oh um your boss's fingertip he was loading something onto a trailer it was like a tilt 
[02:36:30]  kind of trailer where he stands at one end someone was loading onto the back end of it  and it went all the way down and it caught his pinky so ah that's what his hand looks like now  he wait wait wait oh wait they made another pinky though why would they no that's just kind of  that's where it cut off cut off there yeah oh okay it should have been a lot longer wait  wait i can't i can't count this five still there yeah i was looking at four what an idiot yeah it's  actually like you wouldn't probably notice that in casual conversation in regular life his pinky's 
[02:37:00]  like just half the size yeah i think missing the nail now i bet there was a lot of crushing going on  on that that's it that's why they didn't put it back together oh my god i'm looking at it it's  like it's in a glass cube it's the the last knuckle of your pinky oh oh that's good yeah it's like one  of those cubes where they etch your picture at disney in a laser there you go it's one of those  cubes all right i gotta ask you now first of all it's a zombie finger that is creepy oh it's smashed 
[02:37:30]  the nail still on it ed don't put that digit anywhere  so how do you why do you have it uh he's my boss i work with him and uh yeah is that the same boss  that cut up his other employee but why do you have your boss's finger yeah why do you have this  instead of your boss he's no longer attached to it so but how did you get it were you there  why did you want it i work with him like he's my boss no no i understand the boss employee  relationship he keeps it in the office oh it's his yes oh you're just borrowing it for the contest 
[02:38:00]  oh this is like show and tell i'm taking it home with you oh like what's the weirdest thing you  borrowed right yeah it's gotta love philly jimmy well the boss's fingertip worked around the rules  good that's that's a damn good one yeah that's uh were you there when it happened or no nothing  looking no did he scream the hell the paperweight it's like he actually kind of felt like he went  into shock like he wanted to finish doing what he was doing and the guy that he was working with
