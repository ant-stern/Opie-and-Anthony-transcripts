<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily focusing on current events, media personalities, and stand-up comedy, with a heavy dose of vulgarity and irreverence throughout.  The show began with a discussion about the significant increases in MTA tolls in New York City, particularly affecting the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.  Opie, Anthony, Greg, and others expressed their outrage at the rising costs and speculated on the MTA's mismanagement.  This segued into a discussion about the challenges of accessing local sports channels on cable television.

The conversation then shifted to a critique of various media figures.  Charlie Sheen's alleged exploits with a porn star were discussed, along with Mayor Bloomberg's tree-planting initiative.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to mocking the radio show "Scott and Todd," focusing on their perceived lack of edginess and criticizing their appearance.  The hosts also discussed a documentary about a married couple with Down syndrome, highlighting humorous anecdotes from the film, and suggested alternative, outrageous wagers for the traditional World Series bet between mayors.  Guests mentioned at this point included Jackie "the Joke Man" Martling, Otto from "Otto and George," Buck Angel, and a phone call from Ross in Maine, a truck driver with his own radio show.  Jimmy McMillan was also referenced.

The show continued with a discussion centered around a large, naked statue at the Time Warner Center, specifically the significant wear on its penis due to public interaction. This segment featured vulgar language describing people's interactions with the statue and the resulting news story.  The mocking of Scott and Todd continued, with a particularly scathing review of a poorly executed Keith Richards audiobook reading impression and a disastrous Yankees song parody, both described as rambling, nonsensical, and poorly performed.

Jackie Martling joined the show in studio (along with Otto at one point), providing numerous anecdotes from his comedy career.  He shared stories about meeting Les Paul and Keith Richards, his experiences as a gymnast and comedian, his Grammy nomination, and a humorous tale about his first encounter with Otto's act involving an Asian woman and a dummy.  He detailed his experiences at various comedy clubs, especially Pips, recounting bizarre and violent incidents.  His stories included a memorable encounter with Bob Woods, and a detailed recounting of the “Aristocrats” joke, along with discussions of his drinking problem, quitting drinking,  and brushes with censorship.  Martling also discussed picking up women with Otto, including a story involving a woman with an unusually high hairline and a jacuzzi incident referencing her grandfather's suicide. The hosts also played listener-submitted "dump logs" – vulgar and bizarre statements.  A brief "Primetime Sam Roberts One Question Interviews" segment featured Max Weinberg.  Further discussion focused on Martling's early career, including a project with other comedians to raise money for a struggling comedy club and his experiences working with Woody Allen.  Martling and Otto also mentioned upcoming shows.

A later segment with Jackie Martling continued the focus on his stand-up career, detailing his frustrations with club owners and their scheduling practices, using highly offensive language ("cunt," "cocksucker") to describe his experiences. He shared anecdotes about his act, including jokes about bathroom tiles, Pepperidge Farm, and a girl with braces, and recounted a story about a student's application containing a racist statement that he later incorporated into his act. A caller, "Johnny Cleveland," attempted to stump Martling with a joke about breast cancer, which was met with disapproval from the hosts.  Discussions also included bathroom graffiti and a related book.  The overall tone remained highly informal, conversational, and laced with vulgar humor and offensive language throughout the entire broadcast.

[00:03:30]  looks like the pitcher for the uh the giants yeah what's up hamilton good game good game last night  yeah got him the thumbs up all right yeah he's like the moan he really is walking around hey how you  doing i i watched the world i watched the world series because my islanders i used to be able to watch  the islanders um on time warner here in manhattan yeah and i guess they've decided to only show maybe 
[00:04:00]  four games this year because uh great thanks thanks for throwing me the bone so so i write my brother i'm  like yo where's this fucking game it's it's the islanders and the canadians canadians beat them  last night and he goes oh it's on he's on long island different cable uh company obviously and he goes  oh it's on uh a channel called iosp what so then i had to search 1200 channels because i don't have a  good search feature with time warner yeah to try to find a channel called iosp make a long story short 
[00:04:30]  i don't get iosp so i didn't get the islanders game last night so i went and watched the world  series but then i was telling you this morning my cable bill is well over 200 a month and now i got  to go buy the fucking hockey package so i can watch my islanders so how much money do they need  from us they're just gonna soak you and yeah meanwhile they're making everybody buy all these  individual packages yet uh if you have uh cable vision you still don't have fox right so you still  can't watch the world series at your house that is fucking horrible man it's just amazing god bless 
[00:05:00]  fox for uh for uh turning down their you know the latest yeah they're like go fuck yourself they're  playing hardball yeah well who what does fox want what does cable vision i don't know i like you  know they don't uh agree on uh money price yeah yeah fox about the money we want to get paid  uh for you using our uh our material so and cable vision doesn't pay at all they're like screw you  we'll you know we'll give you this like a pittance they're like no we want a competitive price 
[00:05:30]  they actually were cable vision offered fox the same that uh fox is getting from time warner  and they turned him down so i don't know there might be some kind of a a real hate battle going  on this might have gotten personal now and they're in no hurry because you would think they want to  get a deal done you know because the world series is having it yeah but they're in no hurry and god  bless them maybe it breaks up these fuckers because 1200 channels and i can't get my my hockey come on

[00:07:00]  story today for new yorkers but but everyone in the country can relate they are raising the tolls on  the bridges and tunnels again didn't we just talk about this yeah the mta uh the whole place should  be cleared out i mean just fire everybody how does how does such incompetence keep their jobs it's it's  it's the the union of course uh that lets these these criminals that are lining their pockets with  our our dollars it's it they're raising to 13 dollars for the varazano 13 dollars yeah they're 
[00:07:30]  the mta is basically holding the the city hostage at this point because there's no one there's no one  around that could stop them they just make their own rules no one no one governor governs these uh guys  drive through that's all you can do is everybody agreed to plow through and not oh really that's  all you can do they can't they can't arrest everybody it's their board it's the the board met  and decided that uh they needed to get the cars to pay more since they were jacking up the price 
[00:08:00]  of the uh tickets for the subways and buses and stuff right so they said well the cars uh have to do  their share too it's like how about you do your share and figure out how to fucking make money  with what you have already by firing your eight levels of management uh uh by by getting out some 
[00:08:30]  of these slouches that you see sleeping in fucking uh uh the booths uh uh sleeping on the trains what  does bloomberg have to say about this i know i know there's not much he could do but does he say  anything he hates cars he hates commuters by car he probably loves it this fucking pussy loves it  well i mean all the all the bridges are going up but the big one is the verozano which uh connects  what staten island to uh brooklyn i guess it's always been the big expensive bridge so uh it used  to be eleven dollars yeah that's right eleven dollars people are probably like driving off the 
[00:09:00]  road right now from other parts of the country you know some worker wants he fell in the cement and he  dies dumb fuck no they raised it two bucks an 18 rise and it's now 13 i did some quick math  13 so yeah people need the verozano bridge every once in a while i i do the verozano to to cut  through you know don't have to deal with the city to get down to philly or atlantic city yeah or if  you're going you know wherever washington is a cut through it's yeah but staten island is just a 
[00:09:30]  it's a cut through so we can fucking but except a jersey so to me i'm like whatever what what are  you going to do but you got people that are using that bridge every day because they have to use it  for work yeah thirteen dollars a day times five days a week obviously is 65 fucking bucks a week  which leads to about 260 bucks a month just to use the mta bridge to go to your job and in many  cases that 260 doesn't obviously doesn't count the gas obviously doesn't count the parking when 
[00:10:00]  you do get to work and maybe some other fucking uh tolls on the way yeah how are people are uh  supposed to afford that yeah why do they think that's okay that's a that's a car payment is there  any uh what's the uh the metro like from uh what's the train like to brooklyn from stat honestly a  complete nightmare it's not an easy fucking commute from there by there's no train from staten  brooklyn yeah there's no choice for those people how hey what scumbag how are these people supposed  to get to work take the staten island ferry yep to brooklyn well to to lower manhattan and then into 
[00:10:30]  brooklyn and then and then yeah what fucking pieces of shit man you got to go all the way around  because let's say you take the verrazano into brooklyn to uh from staten island to uh manhattan oh  yeah now you either got to go all the way around and take the uh brooklyn bridge right if you don't  want to pay anymore right or if you're in lower manhattan working now you got to take the brooklyn  battery tunnel which they're raising the price of that too how much is that do you know uh see what 
[00:11:00]  they're raising the uh battery tunnel to yeah all the increases are straight across the board it's a  five percent if you're using easy pass and around 18 if you're paying cash oh if you're using cash  good yeah you know what i stand corrected it should be more though if you've cash even the easy pass  fucking fee is way too high it is don't let these fucking guys get away with already it's already  ridiculous yeah i wish everyone had easy pass but you know what that's fucking highway robbery  should be 30 if you don't have it enough already 260 bucks a month to to use their fucking bridge 
[00:11:30]  and then like ann said if you use uh the battery tunnel that's that's another at least six or seven  bucks i would assume yeah what a day right it's currently for cash nine bucks right oh no that's  ferrazano ferrazano that's old because ferrazano's up to 11 and now going up to 13 let's just get a  ballpark figure oh 2008 it was nine a mere two years ago it was nine and now they're up to 13 bucks and  and and and no one is uh stopping them no one is stopping them yeah they they all got together there 
[00:12:00]  was no people don't have a say in it no one has a say in it it's some board that decided we need to  keep our jobs and we need to keep our pay so let's jack up the price for everybody during a time where  people are really struggling it's fucking sickening uh it really is how how the the public transportation  system in new york city is broke is astounding to me it's it's it's beyond reason why isn't someone 
[00:12:30]  looking into this it's new york city you know how many people take public transportation they have  they should have a surplus coming out their ears they have customers all day long all day that's  what you want in a business all day customer i'm in a restaurant with my brother obviously silent  partner i gotta say that every time because he works his ass off but if we had customers all day  long like that we wouldn't even think of raising any prices yeah every time you go to a a toll booth 
[00:13:00]  there's always people lined up customers all day long all day and you're raising your prices that  that that doesn't make sense in the business world they fuck staten island so bad yeah they have  uh the dump is there they just fuck those people man they really do fuck people from staten island  it's the the lost borough yeah they can't go to work without spending money oh battery tunnels 550 cash  they cannot go to work without spending a lot of money and that's one way right yeah so then now 
[00:13:30]  the battery tunnel will cost you eleven dollars round trip if you have to use that and the verrazano  to go into the uh your job every day so basically because of the 18 hike and if you pay cash it's  going to basically go from like 650 uh 550 to 650 yeah amazing and no one looks into this and then  the stupid news will do their cute hey what are you wearing for halloween this year go  fuck yourselves and talk about something real and the politicians will talk about gay marriage 
[00:14:00]  and right and fucking abortion and things that don't make a goddamn bit of difference to 99 of  the people uh but this is everybody that has to drive in and work in new york city that's why  politics is all horseshit in my world because uh you know let's see a politician take this on yeah  instead of all that dumb shit oh can you can can people wear wrestling gear to the polling booths who  gives a yeah well you can i know i know they got that great well well you can i got that overturned  but what the fuck talk about something real on the news you idiots the tolls are two damn i just saw 
[00:14:30]  him by the way as i was taking my taxi in yeah jimmy mcmillan was uh going right from our building to  fox i know it was him it was he is just yeah we're gonna get him on again before the election walking  just uh new york's darling isn't he i think they should have left what they should do is if you  have easy pass they don't raise it at all yes if you have pay cash 25 easily 40 to go through 
[00:15:00]  get the fuck out of my way they're killing the easy pass people too trust that's what i'm saying  they shouldn't raise easy it shouldn't cost that much to use a bridge or a tunnel there's some other  problems with easy pass though like i haven't encountered it but uh i know travis has where you know  cuckolding uh you know you manage your checking account you know pretty much to the dollar  sometimes and uh when your balance gets low on easy pass they'll automatically take funds from your  account yeah yeah so there's been instances where you could overdraw your checking account because 
[00:15:30]  easy pass just decides oh well we need another seventy dollars right now so yeah exactly yeah  ah shit that happens yes that does happen yeah a lot apparently wait they're  fucking criminals man it's fucking criminals eleven dollars right right now what's a five percent raise  five percent of eleven yeah would be uh uh fifty seven fifty cents it's still enough it's still  under twelve that's ridiculous bad enough it's it's ridiculous let's go to ross in maine uh ross what's 
[00:16:00]  up yeah i was just kind of bitch about tolls what else is new i'm a truck driver and uh i own my own  truck i got a radio show yeah really i'm a part of a radio show i tell jokes on the side  hey uh i pay about 500 because i do a lot of the new york area yeah i'm paying about 500 every week  and a half on that toll it's i i understand who's gonna stop these people yeah yeah no one's gonna stop 
[00:16:30]  it but and a truck a truck driver i guess that's got to be the cost of doing business which sucks yeah  it really does suck but for the most part it is a company um and doesn't the company  in some way shape some of that it's probably deductible i don't i don't and they do a lot  more damage to the roads than cars do because they're so heavy it's just need their goods  joe commuter joe and jane commuter uh driving into work every day uh just being raped and the price of 
[00:17:00]  the um for the railroads are all going up it's it's unbelievable they raised everything and cut the  shit out of the service so they cut service they raise the rates and they're still crying poverty  uh they raise my tolls meanwhile i also every three months i get a little slip that i have to pay a uh  mta tax on top of this on top of it they put a new tax in place where i have to pay because i am in a  a zone that is serviced by the long island railroad right i do not use the long island railroad have not

[00:18:00]  know the verrazano bridge back in 1964 i know it's 1964 money was 50 cents each way 50 cent 50 cents in  64 now we're up to 13 dollars 50 cents and they probably said something like we're only going to  have the toll until the bridge is paid for i've heard that rumor forever was that ever true hike they  said the same thing was that really what they you know thought at first i think so and then then 
[00:18:30]  somebody goes fuck that this is free money all day long cash who counts the cash and they got we  got to paint this thing so we need some we need some money dude there's not a there's not an honest  person alive if they see a room full of cash they're not taking a taste yeah i'm sorry i don't care who  you are or what you do for a living if if you're in a cash business and cash is coming in at at those  levels yeah if your if your customers are lined up also and money is just being handed to you are 
[00:19:00]  you gonna all of a sudden stop right all right it's free now yeah no unbelievable oh and well  the good news though mayor bloomberg this was oh good for this was in the paper over the weekend  and and this is a good spot to bring this up you know what bloomberg's trying to do in new york city  or or suck a cock yeah have penises sewed onto his face the entire new york alleged fag  the entire new york city area he has a goal he's he's planting trees that's that motherfucker fuck 
[00:19:30]  the toll hikes don't worry about the toll hikes right mayor bloomberg yeah yeah he's so proud of the  fact that he's uh has a planting tree program going on but he's doing the streets he's doing in the  street he's putting planters in the street he's so out of touch but you want to guess how many trees  he wants planted i i forgot by what year i think like 2012 or something like that a couple more years  he's got how many trees let's guess in new york city the new york city area 18 billion trees  a rain forest thousand trees i don't know how about a million no stop he's trying to plant a 
[00:20:00]  million trees in the new york city area what the before whatever year like 2012 or something and and  just uh so you know where he's up to about 450 000 he's almost halfway there where just wherever  he could find some fucking piece of little dirt he's it's an aggressive act that's why he's put he's  cutting down the uh the lanes to put these fucking turn lanes and bike lanes in that's an aggressive 
[00:20:30]  act because he he likes the fact that cars are out because again he's a coddled irritating  billionaire who doesn't commute in a car he has state troopers take him wherever he needs to go  and if he needs to go in a car they block traffic of course that fucking asshole he's an asshole and  you know what you people that voted for him deserve what you get to vote that jack off in a fourth a  third term yeah oh we'll go back to the trees in a second but uh my heart just stopped verrazano  bridge thank you danny in 2008 that's the last time we had stats statistics yeah i'm sure it's 
[00:21:00]  higher than this now 2008 a hundred i'm getting chills 190 000 vehicles use the bridge per day on  every day so on every day every day and what was in 2008 190 000 vehicles a day i could see that  all right i'm pretty sure it was nine bucks in in 2008 yeah we say that not yeah all right so so  by those stats you tell me why they're fucking broke after you hear this number for one one 
[00:21:30]  bridge by the way the bridge they run all the bridges 1.7 million dollars a day a day they bring  in 1.7 million dollars a day for one fucking bridge a cash business basically oh and now they said you  know what that's not good enough we need more money from people what what the fuck 1.7 million a  day one bridge one bridge and and i'm sure the weekends are a little lower so let's go for  five days a week it probably stays at 1.7 so and that's nine dollars oh now it's gonna be what 
[00:22:00]  13 13 try it for 13 and see what they're gonna rake in a day yeah go with that yeah that's easier  those motherfuckers a week 109 000 a week 100 if everybody paid cash 13 uh the bridge would take  in almost two and a half million dollars a day two and all right knock that down because people  aren't paying cash so it's still over two million a day still two over two million a day and that's  one bridge one fucking bridge look it's one bridge and they can't and they're broke that's one bridge

[00:27:30]  watching her i get like it'll pop right up i'm sure yeah i certainly will um so there you go oh  by the way someone's reminding me too that uh that's just for cars the trucks pay per axle so  they're looking at 26 a day yeah it's infuriating we'll just keep doing this until they get every bit  of our our fucking money on top of that they don't even uh improve the service you still have to wait at  a lot of these tolls yep even with easy pass because everyone either clogs it or or or they 
[00:28:00]  don't have enough easy pass lanes with their snotty fucking toll takers with that fucking attitude  yeah as you hand over your 13 now you still get the nice blow me blow me it's the world's insane  it really is and i'm watching all these political ads i'm like shut the fuck up none of you guys are  going to do anything they're really going to take on the the any issues that are uh on the forefront  of people's minds and we're no you're not you're bullshit with this uh uh distractions to get the 
[00:28:30]  votes and then they don't do anything about the fact that the mta is jacking up prices and one of  one of the birds being a fucking nut with his million trees a million trees you know what else is i'm a  tree guy too and i i think that's ridiculous here's i don't mind a little nature but it's like great a  million trees before all this other shit that is wrong with the city when did uh and i i i never noticed  the this this crept up really slow there's this thing going on with the lights in manhattan where 
[00:29:00]  now there's the left turn and right turn arrows that come on after the initial green light so  you're not allowed to make a right turn or a left turn depending on which way the one-way street  goes right because they let the pedestrians they give them a little time right to cross so uh they  won't let the cars make a right turn because the pedestrians are right but the lights green to go  straight right you can't go straight because the fucking idiots are blocking both lanes to make the 
[00:29:30]  right turn right the the savages can't figure out to stay to the right or there's so many double  parked vehicles that you can't get into that right lane you want to make a right turn now you're stuck  in the straight lane no traffic is getting through it's fucking infuriating there's a fucking up uh  intersection i think it's around fifth avenue here in in the city yeah where there's a left was one of  those left arrows yeah and the pedestrians don't understand that just because my left arrow is 
[00:30:00]  red doesn't mean it's going to turn green any second and they'll just all stand in the lane and  every day i have to scare the shit out of people by either revving my engine up into the sixes or or  you know honking my horn because these retards they're just standing there looking with a dumb  look on their faces i have my green little stupid turn arrow yeah and they're just standing there they  will stand in the street like in your lane also i've seen that move where they stand there and  or or or they'll see one guy that can make it one guy's like he'll look and go yeah i got time there's 
[00:30:30]  a car coming but i got time and he'll start walking and the sheep that are people just see one guy  walking and step right off the curb without looking assuming that if he's going it must be safe  and oh me whoa  i step on the gas i'm beeping the horn i love the scared look of someone that thinks they're dying  the look i get i want to put a camera on the front of my vehicle because the look people give it's that 
[00:31:00]  like they turn look at you their eyes get real big they're scared fuckless i think i told the  story once before but i was flying down on the street because like you know how sometimes you  get lucky and like there's just a whole empty block where you can just fly down gas it and i knew that  i saw the light turn in halfway down so i knew i had to stop but i was slowing down uh but i guess  some old lady was crossing the street and she just all she saw was like an engine you know and a car  coming at her barreling up and she just pulled that it was like the classic movie where she just kind of 
[00:31:30]  turned saw what was going on put her hands up and just went  and i laughed so that's hard it was raising his hand one of my favorite things i've ever seen  anthony do was i was following you down 57th one day oh as he it's that weird time where it's it's  yellow almost red but anthony doesn't stop he just as it's getting to the as he's getting to the  intersection you lay on the horn and you and you plow right through right as it turns red oh yeah yeah 
[00:32:00]  yeah i i couldn't keep up with you you just shot and hit every red light down there with the horn  going yeah we all have a favorite anthony moment they changed they changed the timing on my uh my i  think it's 47th yeah i turned down 47th street to get up here off a third um and they changed the  timing so i have to make that turn on 47th and instantly hit the gas as hard as i can to get over uh  park avenue because it it starts like i see the light turn yellow and people are crossing the 
[00:32:30]  street i'm on the horn they're running out of the way it's fucking great it's like a gta real life gta  yeah they're like bouncing against the walls the next word the next thing are they going to get  you with is uh the traffic uh cameras you notice there's more yeah yeah more of those around because  the technology is getting cheaper i guess so they're gonna yeah they're gonna wire the entire  city with traffic uh yeah you'll see that flash and you'll be like up and all of a sudden you're  just getting bills in the mail because they need more money from you the ant villains 
[00:33:00]  all right you know what we're gonna break a little early today because we got a busy show we got uh  jackie the joke man coming in today promoting a gig i think he's promoting a gig on staten island  matter of fact i think also otto from otto and george and is buck angel still coming in yeah eight o'clock  eight o'clock oh jesus buck is very sexy and why isn't stupid bobo showing up bobo called me last  night saying like and i can hear it in his voice that he was really really upset about this always 
[00:33:30]  sound like that no but there was a usually you could sway him but i could hear it that like he was really  serious yeah it was a strange thing and he said that he i guess one of his family members has some  kind of moving business a movie company so he calls me he's just like i i my uncle needs me i have to move  it's it's very it's i i can't i can't not do it i can't i could come in friday but i can't and i'm  just like all right we'll figure something you can't tell his uncle that he's doing something with  apparently a hermaphrodite i told i even asked him like i was like how much are they paying you 
[00:34:00]  figuring that it wasn't going to be too much and then we could just buy them off yeah but you know  but like i i've told before bobo has no concept of money he has no idea how money works so when i asked  him how much he got paid for the gig he told me somewhere between five hundred and a thousand  dollars he doesn't know no he has no i mean he's gonna get a couple hundred bucks what did he what  was his answer when you asked him how much he thinks people make yeah he thinks like me and travis make  like seven hundred dollars a year but seven hundred dollars he doesn't understand like long-term money 
[00:34:30]  like he understands short-term money like he understands if you go to white castle and you  want a crave case like it's going to be like eighteen dollars or whatever that he understands that's his  world but he doesn't understand that over the course of a year a person might make more than  seven yeah that's a little fella oh is he a dog his uncle wants him to work for him obviously  yeah because he's giving he's giving him like ten bucks telling him it's five hundred  he has another difference he's a dollar eighty put this towards something rich we want to do  something with buck angel and bobo obviously yeah that's the bit of course all right uh when we get 
[00:35:00]  back jock tober and uh and the news refuses to say a certain word oh of course a new a new one  they were the news refuses to say a certain word a new word i fully expect it from wimpy radio stations  and and other places but the news is the news they should be able to say whatever fucking word  they want which are pussies wait to hear which word it is it's ridiculous

[00:37:30]  giant muscles a big clit right it's the beauty of buck  god damn i guess we can ask some questions uh i i gotta say i uh last night was documentary night  oh yeah uh at my house i was i watched a lot of documentaries one was monica and david  it's a little documentary on hbo called monica and david nice what's that and you'd think why would 
[00:38:00]  i give a shit about watching a documentary called monica and david because they are two adult down  syndrome people that got married and they show they did a whole documentary before the wedding  the wedding and then their life after the wedding living with uh the the girl's uh stepfather and  mother uh in the in the house that's a great show i was howling howling and not not for like  not like like hey look at the retards you know it just some of the shit they are doing 
[00:38:30]  is funny as fuck they're they're trying to be self-sufficient and everything you know  cold whatever sure and and they have to take the recycling bin and bring it back to the house  house so she's rolling it and then she's supposed to put it against the wall of of the the house  in this little wooden fenced in area so he's on the other side of it so she's pushing it into the 
[00:39:00]  wall and she's like like people with down syndrome apparently they have a routine and they have to  follow it every day and and she puts it against the wall and now he's helping her because they're  married and he's pulling it as she's pushing it and now his back is against the wall and she's  trying to put it against the wall but her husband's in the way no concept that he needs to get out of  the way and he goes no he is good she goes no it's gotta be against the wall and then he she she's 
[00:39:30]  pushing it into him and he's squeezing trying to squeeze out from behind it it's a scream they  have ocd they got ocd they're crazy do you mean the people with all odds in life against them  didn't do the recycling right they didn't do the recycling right and then they were working they  were working at um uh one of the um one of the little care down syndrome care centers that they go 
[00:40:00]  to they go to and they give them little jobs to do so they had to fold up these and they're pain  chips they had to fold up these papers and put them in envelopes you might as well have given  them uh a math problem that stephen hawking couldn't figure out they're trying to fold these these pieces  of paper and put them in the envelopes it's like this is too big he fell manly in love with monica  that's my girl and someday i'm gonna marry her she's kind of fuckable though 
[00:40:30]  i want more of a natural these are the parents talking yeah two people who love each other and  want to be together she's pretty good looking for uh she's not bad for a tard yeah it is the light of  my life and i firmly believe that i was thinking the same thing like for a tard she almost i've seen  uglier tards she almost looks like foreign but listen  my husband she's really she doesn't look she looks like rosie yeah they show them cooking 
[00:41:00]  this is difficult they're trying to put things in envelopes  needs and desires they are very much like everyone else  oh no that's what your mom said  what are they thinking of jumping out the window what was that scene about  we're gonna have to get audio from this associate with society yeah they're not giving much audio 
[00:41:30]  because we want to protect them so much we are typically the first ones you just know his  cock is giant it's a fat cock he's a wrecking ball four by eleven  it's a chode he's a chode we got to get audio this yeah yeah properly but they talk about what  they want to do for a living and uh she's asking questions that are just you know i mean obviously 
[00:42:00]  she's checking a watch where does she have to go yeah she's putting on makeup so what do you want  to do for work i want to bounce a ball son of job sir and she didn't oh they're all drinking  champagne that's good then they just show them dancing at their wedding they were uh they were  moving they were moving uh because the the family the husband was retiring they were apparently from  money so we're moving down to florida and this girl uh like i said down syndrome people have their 
[00:42:30]  their their routines every day and she she likes cleaning so she's cleaning the bathroom and she  would put her comb in the middle of the drawer and then close the drawer real slow looking in it  to make sure it didn't move from the exact middle of the drawer and it's just a comb that's all she  puts in the in the drawer so then they're moving is it a blue comb so i don't know what it was my  life a lot easier all right the blue comb sorry yeah it's one comb and then and then so they're 
[00:43:00]  moving so they start taking shit out and and she starts putting it back she didn't understand the  concept of moving and and she goes into a room and goes all of my pajamas are gone i don't know how  i'm going to sleep where are my clothes my clothes are all gone and it's like we're moving we're leaving  this place yes but everything i have is not here anymore who's more of a disaster out of the two of 
[00:43:30]  them oh uh actually he is he's more of a disaster but she gets into these things where she's talking  they asked them they asked each of them individually uh what is handicapped and she goes it's when you  can't walk and you're in a wheelchair she can't say wheelchair she goes wheelchair and you can't hear or or  talk uh and then they asked um uh the guy if he if david if he was handicapped and he goes sometimes 
[00:44:00]  and then he goes do you know what down syndrome is and he said yes and she goes do you you know you  have down syndrome is that a handicap he goes no i have down syndrome sometimes no it's all the time  they're just trying you you would be you would be i all i was thinking is jimmy and bobby would  probably tear up at it i wouldn't tear up you wouldn't tear up no there was some moments that 
[00:44:30]  were kind of sweet like what i don't know name a name a sweet moment when they wake up in the  morning and the mother comes into the bedroom to wake them both up and the guy the second his eyes  open his hands are all over the retarded girl he's like and i think he grabbed her pussy at one  point he's constantly grabbing her ass and kissing her and just mauling he's mauling her can i tell  you that retarded morning breath is probably not good i thought that too because the girl's talking  right into her mom's face the second she woke up like wow god only knows she was eating bugs 
[00:45:00]  and you know that that dream probably caused a lot of sour spit it wasn't a good one  one what did you dream uh just that the that milk was chasing me what what that's our dreams too  our dreams don't really make sense either and i bet your dreams are really lucid and different like  what did you dream well that i was arguing a case uh before harvard right and uh there was a problem  with the uh the tort that's probably what it really is and they can't explain that to anyone that they're 
[00:45:30]  geniuses where they're no idea yeah right they're arguing before the supreme court right  making good points right the jobs they give them are fantastic too i got a stamp she had to take a  stamp and put it in ink and then stamp these paper bags at this uh clothing store i i would imagine that  all that's really cute until uh they start growing pubic hair then it just becomes jesus enough already  well uh they're they're adults i mean they said something like in in uh the early 80s the life 
[00:46:00]  expectancy for someone with down syndrome was uh 25 years old and now with um medical technology and  wait they only live not 25 they only did now it's 60 so they've increased now it's 15  why what do they die of at uh 25 they they have a lot of problems i never knew this before  uh diabetes things like that because david has diabetes he's got to give himself insulin shots and  that was a whole production like how much to give himself and when and and how to count and oh my 
[00:46:30]  god it just looks like a disaster they have to live with the parents though they're like they want to be  independent and want to work and the parents are so sheltering because they don't want their their  kids to be made fun of like the mother was saying like she would lose her fucking mind if she saw  people making fun of them so they actually keep them in the house and shelter them the the guy was  going like i want to get a job at the grocery store i want to get a job at the grocery store and the 
[00:47:00]  mother was like no she doesn't want him being in the public eye where he could be ridiculed but he  wouldn't know i mean would he yeah it's it's an odd thing the parents were very um but all parents  are like that even if you're a quote normal kid i guess you can't you know what's normal right  we all know it isn't but is that about her you think huh you think that's about the mother being  embarrassed i i think maybe that's what i'm gonna be embarrassed or i'm not sure because she was  saying that like she just the thought of people ridiculing her daughter was like she couldn't even 
[00:47:30]  fucking deal with it so um so hate this show shelters it oh yeah she would not fans of this  program would not why would they allow it oh this show yeah yeah i'm thinking she she probably it was  a cousin that did the documentary it was a family cousin and it was done in a way there was no  ridiculing it showed them like you know it didn't show them fucking tumbling down the stairs or licking  fucking uh a statue or something it was just them fucking trying to be regular people we should get 
[00:48:00]  some audio of that it was it was it was cool i i i thought it was good a lot of laughs a lot of laughs  any tears in no there were there were some tender moments you choke up a little bit nope didn't  choke up at all i choked up at the next documentary sins of the father oh jesus that was the pablo  escobar uh the son that was good right that was a good one it's subtitled so you non-readers uh pay  no attention but uh it's uh a look at pablo escobar through his son and um he actually meets up with 
[00:48:30]  the sons of two uh prominent politicians that were murdered by pablo escobar and then there's the  son meeting with these two sons of the the murdered uh politicians so that was a little  fucking tense and they were big time oh yeah pablo didn't have these were like one was about to be  elected president of colombia he had major major people killed yeah yeah he was a bad guy man he was 
[00:49:00]  just a bad man and you knew the second he was dissed because he was actually a politician he became  what a congressman he wanted to the senate yeah the senate and uh he uh a few of these other  politicians like this guy's a drug lord yeah to ask him where he gets his money but so they forced him  to retire and that's when he just lost his fucking mind and decided oh yeah you're gonna fuck you  gonna fuck with me he was humiliated he was humiliated so he just started killing every critic 
[00:49:30]  of him killing them all and he also um after uh oh i forget what i was gonna say it was something  about after he was uh into congress and then he had to leave oh he had such power that he had the uh  constitution of columbia change so they wouldn't extradite uh citizens because he was so afraid of  extradition that's all he was afraid of was getting extradited like to the united states and being  tried because he you know you're going away forever he knows in columbia he went to prison 
[00:50:00]  he built his own prison which he then escaped from his prison was a palace a palatial fucking mansion  uh that he built for himself so he knew how to get out of it yeah exactly probably when he  was building it he had a little escape plan he escaped uh because they were going to transfer him  to a real prison real place yeah because he was running his own operation yeah he was still running  the operation murders uh cocaine it was amazing and then he got out and um he fucked up on the phone 
[00:50:30]  is what what what finally got him missed his family missed his family enough where he he was making  phone calls that they traced they found where he was and they have uh the recording of his call 30  seconds before he died you hear in the pablo goes uh uh what was that i'll call you back i'll call you  back and it sounds like it was helicopters outside you could hear through the phone that's pretty cool  see helicopters helicopters and that was it 30 seconds before he died and they fucking shot him in the 
[00:51:00]  face they showed pictures of him on that rooftop holy fuck shot him right in the face to make sure  he was dead oh yeah oh yeah well yeah that's a good one sins of the father los pepes for the guys who  were targeting him they were crazier than him i think holy shit they were drug lords and i think that i  think they're like cali cartel yeah i also think the u.s was involved yeah yeah yeah where anybody who  helped escobar they killed they killed family members they got really really awful and they 
[00:51:30]  murdered anybody that tried to assist him so his fucking lifeline got cut off yeah got him on the  phone what a badass though holy shit good documentary really good documentary day very good um you want  to do some jocktober who wouldn't where's uh where sam we got to get sam in here do a quick jocktober and  then we got uh jackie the joke man in the meantime we were talking world series a little bit we forgot  to talk about the mayor's bet oh no do they have a sound let me guess every year it's a mayor's bet

[00:59:00]  and you guys aren't the only one that get a little edgy when you talk about kristin davis  because we know where she came from oh boy used to be not a hooker though she's a madam hold on  it doesn't matter when scott and todd get a hold of it mad men throw the facts out the window  they still do well in the ratings well enough what are ratings i mean they got their audience  they're just they're they're fucking terrible they're all they're all my mama  where are my wife's daughter what happened to you 
[00:59:30]  fucking guy just bugs me  he's like a talking rock  dumb tongue what happened i hate him he looks like rocky dennis we did that whole thing last year  really awful pulling the pins out of the map you're supposed to go with me my wife says i look  like a lion does she you're fucking that drunk share putting crank into her womb 
[01:00:00]  pumped out that fucking monster  rocky dennis you know man google image god fucking jesus i wish share would go in and try  to wake him up for his morning show open the shades chin mcgillicuddy  his fucking chin bugs me oh is he a boob yeah jimmy you said easter island head yeah yeah  you got that uh look his hair is nailed on it's fucking really is it's disturbing to look his skin 
[01:00:30]  is so stretched his eyebrows he constantly looks surprised oh my goodness you know it was the  number one scott and todd fan back in the day he rock you bet he you want to defend yourself please  no i worked for them no you didn't look at hannity next to the hanger on look you  punch that picture up look at hannity's head compared to scott shannon's head yeah yeah like  hannity's got a normal size head it's bizarre it's huge it's really really large that is the biggest 
[01:01:00]  jaw i've ever seen in my life god  he's got a tennis ball for a chin yeah that's crazy makes him look manly he looks like quagmire from  family yes all right they talk about kristin davis john potter had to apologize for calling  kristin davis the gubernatorial candidate a hooker because she really technically wasn't she wasn't  the hooker no she says she never has had sex for money she said i'm sorry i called kristin davis a 
[01:01:30]  hooker big column today a big headline yeah she just made money off of other people doing that  well she was the she was the hooker booker right she's a madam she's a madam right for the escort  sir is is todd's job just to repeat like big phrases in a story what's great about this is  big headline when we were setting up the clip yeah everything all the information that's in this clip 
[01:02:00]  was given out by jim in a single moment he said yeah she wasn't a hooker she was a madam  mm-hmm that's all you need to say yeah except they spend what a minute  yeah that's a good idea reading uh we should compare scott from last year to this year because  there's a drop-off and we're big fans of the drop-off from year to year put together a scott montage 
[01:02:30]  yeah oh yeah she's a madam right for the escort service she said she had a business degree and she  wanted to make more money than she could just doing regular business so that's what she's doing business  all right damn all right that was nonsense why is this voice slowed down everyone else's isn't  making more business all right they gotta fill time i mean they got all this time what if scott and  imus did a show yeah yeah because imus i mean we love the guy but he's he's had a drop-off too 
[01:03:00]  who are our guests today john imus no we got a little senator coming out and start talking about the  upcoming election well we should do some more comedy bitch do you do song parodies i used to do song  parodies back in the day i don't do much anymore we do all the two movies yeah i ain't in trouble too much 
[01:03:30]  i ain't in trouble too much once i'm not behind it all  i can understand them turd hey turd turd turd turd  i would go hey scott your head so big you can't even fit into the lincoln tunnel  nailed him totally  he's looking for turd he doesn't know where it is that should be on a hot button exactly 
[01:04:00]  that documentary you watched ah down syndrome sorry eric i don't mean that shit now yeah monica and eric  on hbo scott brings up the famous the famous uh penis uh guy statue that's right we've talked about  it yes in the time one building i video people touching the fucking penis statue i sucked the 
[01:04:30]  paint off that thing very good that's why it's very good jimmy if you notice it it does uh the  the penis on it has a worn everybody grabs it everyone grabs the fucking greasy hands they've  polished it down ah it's bob kelly it really does i guess the the times and uh a bunch of new york  papers finally did a story on it because everyone goes there and gets their picture taken with the  penis statue and touches the penis and all that so they had to bring up the big story here everything  new york on scott of course got to keep it local there's a big statue at the time warner center 
[01:05:00]  there's a big statue his nasal fucking passage is closed i don't think that's a cold i think that's uh  from surgery is that todd you know what you stand there they grab your hog dude it takes the paint  off boom you smile i'm giant there's a big statue at the time warner center mall you know over there  the shops at columbus circle bill that's right near you and oh yes they have a great big statue in there 
[01:05:30]  12 feet tall and they have some problems it's a pretty impressive piece  fernando botera is that how you say his name gives a shit familiar with it might have something  over my house like that yeah no a lot of 12 foot statues you don't have the paintings with the big  fat really like huge round fat people that was botero yeah botero you know that you know like the other  two uh they're they're slowing down their deliveries just to kind of hang with scott they want to be 
[01:06:00]  going a lot faster with their show you could hear it well the last thing you want to hear it you  can't go on scott's show and outshine scott right big thank you  he stinks his fucking salivary gland just be squeezed out of his mouth you don't think he sounds  natural when he talks slow yeah yeah the time warning building is a big statue 
[01:06:30]  he's a wreck exactly what he said it's a wreck his face looks like he's constantly facing the wind  it's a mess it's just what did he do back right it's affecting his speech it was botero yeah botero  sorry and and statues as well this guy's name is adam and there there's a big problem going on because  he's naked and he's 12 feet tall why do they do that he has put a pair of pants he has like a little 
[01:07:00]  miniature thing on him yeah well that's what they that's what they do that's his thing he liked it  that way he like yeah you'll see like did him yeah big fat women with little tiny breasts and  i mean that's just though that's what his style so oh that is terrible you weren't interested in  the artist who did the statue was that the same artist that did the the fat woman that was in  front of k-rock because i was a fat woman with little breasts oh probably like rosie that was a 
[01:07:30]  botero it probably was a botero this is how bad that radio show is i like botoxo  don't give a shit what you did for this business you suck oh this is how bad they are they were  talking about a 12 foot statue and people grabbing its dick and they lost me yeah yeah they couldn't  how do you lose me on that yeah it could be the easiest thing to do on radio how do you 
[01:08:00]  that they couldn't talk about it also because it's regular radio well they continue talking  about it so let's give them a second chance here yeah it's not done yet jimmy spoke too soon i think  i got you well the problem is when people come in there tourists come in there to take a picture  by adam it's about his personality they reach up and grab his thing they do yeah look there's a  who the fuck is saying that in the background they do he's fucking horrendous yeah you do  underpants underpants underpants he's just background noise you know what he is he's like 
[01:08:30]  it's like hearing someone being interviewed in a bowling alley there's just fucking verbal pins  falling down so shut the fuck up you fucking broad shut up what's worse is they've been on the  radio together longer than we have dude all he's saying is like oh it's terrible  they're gonna put pants on it they do why pants why wouldn't you touch it it's a great facebook  photo kind of fucking guy thinks like that right who gives a shit you touch the fucking penis and 
[01:09:00]  you move on that's all he does is chime in the back with nonsense it's like rubbing buddha's belly  exactly you just jack off the fucking statue right i've actually good luck i've actually watched  families getting their picture taken i'll walk right up and go don't you wish you were tall so you  could suck that thing i'll tell you this much if you don't touch the penis you're gay  what because you got feelings inside you can't handle yeah then you're not secure about your  own masculinity if you don't touch the penis you're gay if you can't touch a 12-foot tall gentleman's 
[01:09:30]  right cock because it's silly you grab the fucking thing and you know it is i'm gonna be him it's  silly it is oh yeah yeah because it's cool his little ding-a-ling why is it white because it's  so many people are taking pictures so many people have taken pictures worn away yeah it's gold it's  kind of gold when the rest of it is a dark bronze yeah because it's been rubbed clean a building  work that's not to use his name why why is that because he's a douchebag it's not even done in 
[01:10:00]  humor they would have dumped out of that at cbs huh they would have dumped out of that of course  they would yeah yeah yeah because she's the worst lawyers ever yeah you can't say you can talk about  the penis without mentioning the word penis and then talk about it's a statue we're talking about  yes i know uh but you can't talk about uh stroking the penis okay you know what at cbs i bet you we  wouldn't even be able to do the story at all no that's there would be no way to do it that you  had to walk on over there yeah like when they just said that because they referenced they said the 
[01:10:30]  word penis and then like in the next sentence they said something about rubbing it in my brain  went oh dump yeah yeah yeah ah do we have the dump logs i have uh they used to get really mad at  us when we read the dump i like to read them sometimes out of context because we have to do  on a slow morning bring that in and we're going to go through some of my favorite  when louis was in huh when louis was in then you'd realize why the dump guy was there louis says  cunt but with a k yeah yeah and then he looks all puzzled yeah what i can't do that oh you can't 
[01:11:00]  you can't say i diomere shit in her mouth i said ship not shit that's not to use his name said  legend would have it that when they put him in here he wasn't smiling now he's smiling  that's it that's a what was that noise oh yeah hopefully a machine gun shooting all of them  there's not a genuine moment on that show no not a genuine moment of conversation and they still 
[01:11:30]  fucking have their job oh we got a dump sheet oh my god look at all louis ck's you just read the louis  ck dumps from june 27th 2008 when we were on regular radio commercial radio  722 you poop your pants on my body 722 again diarrhea that came out of your anus 724 diarrhea on top of  the chocolate 724 diarrhea dispenser 724 splurge diarrhea all over your food

[01:12:30]  going in oh boy and then 845 and 55 it just says douchebags and 856 just in quotes and this is why i  love the out of context dump report i can have a gun and an erection none of those should have been  dumped by the way the last four the last four should not have been dumped right all right scott and todd  uh  bit time all right i mean you guys know where they shine oh hold on we're not done with the penis 
[01:13:00]  thing i thought we were oh damn it no oh yeah we're gonna laugh again is there any way to get back  like 10 seconds somebody in the store that's that customer who's laughing saying you can see his pee  peepee's a different color because people are always rubbing on it yeah oh dump that yeah we  wouldn't be able to do that say the peepee's a different color because people are always rubbing  on it well scott and todd are a little more edgy than the opian anthony show on k-rock there was a

[01:30:30]  his whole american song and all of a sudden the oceans white with foam he says is that the  fucking best i can do and he put it in the drawer for like two years and then pulled it out two years  later and became this huge thing oh no kidding i didn't know the history of the ocean isn't white  with foam it's blue and then the foam is kind of there and though as the wave breaks he needed to  rhyme home and he's going a b c moon june spoon right yeah oh wow yeah he had a rhyme home home  and that's the best thing you come up with and that that the keith richards bit i you know a third 
[01:31:00]  grader could have done better but i have a classic story i met les paul and keith richards the same night  do we got two seconds to tell you so this is your time let's roll there's a booker named adam sands  that for 10 years was trying to get me and fred norris you got to come see les paul you gotta  leave us alone leave us alone finally one night uh carrie ash grabs me and she says you're going  to les paul's birthday party it's his 85th birthday party you're coming i don't care if i have to drag  you he's a fan he knows you blah blah i'm like bullshit you know but it turns out old people don't 
[01:31:30]  sleep they're up all nights and they you know so he would listen to the story listen everything  and he was sharp as a tack he died at 94 as sharp as any of us you know it's hard to believe  so we go to see him oh and she says you got to come the rolling stones might be there  the rolling stones right so this is when i was at marlowe's at like 63rd and broadway so um  i go to the show and we're sitting there and les paul comes walking down the aisle to go on stage 
[01:32:00]  and i hear him saying to adam the booker he goes jackie the joke man's here and i couldn't believe  that came out of les paul's mouth right and keith richards is sitting there with the scarf and he's  got his hair all done up you know with the with the curls and and and you know the whole rock star  thing and he's with his mother and his stepfather keith richards is and his mother was a blues singer  i didn't know how could we not know that did you know that i never knew keith richards mother was a  blues singer and knew les paul so here it's my first time ever seeing him and i'm still drinking at the 
[01:32:30]  time so i'm getting bombed and les paul uh fools around for a second he says and and jackie the joke man  is here jackie the joke man let's bring jackie the joke man on stage and i i couldn't believe  it because this is his birthday party and i mean the place is jammed with you know affectionados of  of jazz and but crazy i mean it's just a real eclectic crowd what am i gonna do so i go up on  stage and he says so you tell dirty jokes how you tell dirty jokes i'm like yeah he says well go ahead 
[01:33:00]  tell me tell me some of your dirtiest jokes and i'm a little loaded so i hit him in between the  eyes with like five jokes and he almost almost died right there laughing and we were best friends  for like nine years after that so the crowd couldn't really believe that this guy is up at  les paul's birthday party telling disgusting jokes and so i was just in heaven just in heaven so  i said you know i sit down and uh les paul says all right now now we got another great guy here we  got with keith richards here and so he brings keith richards up on stage and keith richards comes on stage 
[01:33:30]  he says i don't know if i could follow that bloke and i'm like wow you know so i'm sitting out there  with a hard on he's falling around so keith takes the guitar and plays you know three songs or  something and the crowd's going nuts they're having a great time and um les paul's trying to get keith's  mother come up and sing and she won't come up and sing she won't come up and sing so he's making a  big deal about this is keith's mother and she's a blues singer and come on and sing i can't think of  her name because it's so random i would i would have looked up so she wouldn't come up and sing 
[01:34:00]  mrs richards so then yeah so he he talks a little bit more after keith gets off and you could see  it would it was bugging him a little the whole dirty joke thing and also he goes you know this  and i i went to see him 50 times 70 times he never had anybody on stage twice ever ever he's like you  know it bring jackie the joke jackie the joke come come back up here because it was bugging him you  you know they'll just meet me it was fun for him it was fun for me so i'm a little little drunker 
[01:34:30]  now and keith richards has been up there so meanwhile if his mother is a blues singer she'd  been around the block and her son's a rolling stone for christian so i come on stage and i say  oh les it's so nice you have me back up listen you know before we go any further let me just say uh  keith i'm really sorry uh if i knew your mom was here i certainly wouldn't you know done those filthy  filthy jokes you know and he stands up and he says yeah well i'll tell you something about your mom  and i'm like and i turned to the crowd and i said i'm getting heckled by a fucking rolling stone how 
[01:35:00]  cool is that so the crowd goes nuts someone sitting in this ball goes jackie you know you sit there and  you write notes for the guy tell me how it works tell me i said less listen it's you know my balls are  this big i'm drunk i said it's your 85th birthday you know they're here to see you they these are jazz fans  and and lifelong fans because some of them might know the howard stern show some might not they  might know what who cares i'll tell you what you do why don't you do your show and we'll hang out 
[01:35:30]  when the show's over you know we'll go to the bar and we'll talk about the stern show we'll have a few  beers and and uh maybe keith will join us and uh who knows maybe he'll buy us a drink and if he  doesn't have any money maybe he could use some of those beads that are in his fucking hair  and the crowd went fuck because he was all done up with the beads yeah yeah and the crap i mean it  was one of the biggest laughs i ever got the place exploded and i turned to the crowd and i said  now i'm fucking with a rolling stone how cool is that and they went for and afterwards me and keith 
[01:36:00]  hung out and drank beer and did you get a photo with him yeah i got a picture of me  it's not just me unless paul and keith but it's with his mother and his stepfather the five  is in there getting drunk that's pretty cool man so you know that hung out with keith richard  but the thing i wanted to say is that he really does mumble and he really does sound like he's  done all those drugs and done all that drinking right but in his mumbling he's incredibly eloquent  he's brilliant right he doesn't it's kind of like he doesn't mumble in that yeah because people get 
[01:36:30]  distracted by how ozzy talks but if you really listen to him he's he's hilarious and he's very  he's very smart it's right so when people are doing goofs on him you know well that's a horrible  goof is what you're getting at scott and todd are the worst as far as radio goes i didn't mean to  make such a long-winded story but keith richard doesn't come up every two seconds we don't have  a fucking rolling stone story jackie so i have one you do yes oh do you what happened i i saw them walk  by and they were going to perform and we went and watched them all right i i met stein brenner's pillow

[01:45:30]  things around the last telling of it we'll make believe we never heard it so i always  always have had to go to the bathroom i eat a pig and drink like a pig or used to and so i got and  and i i'm also hyper so very and i'm always behind so very often if i'm going out at night i'll grab  something to eat grab something to eat because you got to get something in your stomach and run out  and go to the bar go wherever i am i would always have to take a crap no matter what then and i'm 
[01:46:00]  not a guy that just could hold it i could because i'm gonna laugh and i'm gonna goof and i don't  want to crap yeah which i've done plenty of times too so i got so i could go to the bathroom  anywhere and i mean anywhere and it got to a point where the the people that hung out with me knew  my routine like when we're at a bar or something you know bars have horrible bath you know so all  of a sudden they'd see oh there there goes jackie they'd see me go to the bar and grab a big stack  of bar napkins and they knew what was up right now there's a place at michigan state called max bar 
[01:46:30]  which is still there it's been there for a couple hundred years one of those little tiny dumps of a  bar and all the fraternity guys used to go there and hang out there now me and the guys my band would  go there because they loved that we were the pillowcase with a y pillowcase and we were just  drunken we were a horrible band but we was so much fun that we were the top party band at michigan  state because we would run over and pull the girls pants you know we were just insane and they'd play  a little rolling stones you know people keep them happy i actually used to do that stupid 
[01:47:00]  gymnastic routine we'd be starting out to thank god it's friday party and it'd be a big open thing  and i'd run out and do a flip or something just and the people like what the fuck you know  i was an idiot so we would go to these but this bar because the fraternity guys loved us and they'd see  us so it was probably five pitches for a dollar or whatever it was back then it was a friday afternoon  special but they'd buy us drinks so you know the guys in the band said hey let's go there because  we don't have to spend money because they'll take care of us so we'd go there to let these guys buy  us drinks and this was one of these bars an old crummy bar that had a little tiny bathroom with a 
[01:47:30]  door that didn't really shut right you know what i mean like a wooden door that didn't really shut  right with a tiny you know there's a little uh seat a little crapper and a sink right next to it and  it was and a little tiny urinal it was like a really small bathroom you know and i would go in  there and the door wouldn't really shut right and one night i was in there and i grabbed my bar napkins  and larry wick at my guitar player oh there he goes you know and i go running in because i had to 
[01:48:00]  you know i ate something and ran out to go get drunk and i my stomach's going so i'm sitting there  and i'm i'm taking a crap and i'm trying to hold the door but yeah you know you just finally said  hell with it so i'm sitting there and a fraternity guy i swear to you this isn't that great a story  except for the fact that it's true i'm sitting there and this drunken fraternity guy comes in  and he stands at the urinal and i yeah this sounds gay but you know this is 1966 i'm sitting taking a 
[01:48:30]  crap and the guy's standing taking a piss and he looks down at me and he goes oh wow man he says i've  been coming to this bar for three years and i've only seen two people take a  shit in this bathroom and you're both  you're that guy is that a great stuff anywhere there's no fucking uh stall around the toilet

[02:04:00]  were younger where else are you gonna go but you get your car you go drive somewhere i lived in  residential i didn't have money for hotel rooms when i was 16 17 i was making money yeah 200 a day on the  street jesus that's because he wasn't uh driving i've known jackie how we go back to the a zillion  years what mid 70s late 70s well i didn't start to like 70 years the rainy night house 1979 the rainy  night house in queens on what was that union union turnpike and 200 i remember sitting there and and 
[02:04:30]  watching uh this guy and i said there's not a funny bone in this guy's body and then the next time i came  back i said you know this guy he's a little funnier now and it was a fucking paul riser oh he wasn't even a  little but the oh yeah wait wait you can't just jump past that no no no he just wasn't funny but  he probably was i just wasn't sophisticated you know like he was up there just you know  rambling and i'm like where the fucking jokes you know and then six months later he was funny  the first time i saw you and i had god damn it i haven't thought about this in 20 years and i had 
[02:05:00]  it on a micro cassette and i don't know what happened to it i i he looked like he'd be interesting so i  turned on the micro cassette to you know for whatever reason because i'm sitting with rob  bartlett and we're sitting there and i had never seen otto before so i don't know his act from adam  right and neither at bartlett this is very in the very very beginning 1979 so  the fucking auto gets up there so you don't know what's part of somebody's act and what isn't  and there's a an asian girl sitting right in front of him oh no and i don't know this is a 
[02:05:30]  mainstay of his act so me and bartlett were going to quit comedy that night because we thought this  is off the top of his head and it turns out his main thing but he goes up there with the  fucking dummy and we're already peeing and he goes uh blah blah blah blah blah blah and also he just  takes george and pushes george's face nose to nose in front of the girl and says excuse me miss  oh my fucking shirt's ready and i'm telling you on this micro cassette you can hear me and bartlett 
[02:06:00]  gasping for fucking air and i thought we but had something he's been saying forever and i thought  it was just off the top of his oh my god we said we got to get out of comedy and i've been laughing  and i'm never you just one of the funniest i just don't go for the salty talk oh yeah i don't go for  that salty yeah i'm bringing that salty language i don't care for that i had to do some fucking phone  in yesterday this guy was really on my nerves he was like uh he was wanting me to uh do jokes about  greg giraldo and then and he's like saying um well what do i feel about gays in the military i go i 
[02:06:30]  don't know there's a war going on what do you want bits from me yeah maybe i was crazy show is that  just some fucking stupid internet thing just couldn't i'm so much more comfortable with you  guys what do you want to talk about giraldo i'm not saying that's off limits i mean he was a comic  but i mean you know what are they trying to get it it's a terrible thing i don't know let's go back  to you being comfortable you don't seem very comfortable to me i don't we're doing um we're  doing a roast for um florentine yes tuesday and the money's going to go to the greg's kids next 
[02:07:00]  tuesday comics yeah uh comics uh who else is on it i'm on it you're on it everybody i saw the line  oh is that going to be a bash fest yeah yeah oh you guys know him too well just be mean as possible  right yeah yeah you lived with him for uh three years three years so yeah fuck your mother  leaving it boy yeah  i lived with him for three years three years in that shithole moldy 
[02:07:30]  fucking apartment my first paid gig in comedy i love florentine yeah yeah he's great  me and jackie were in uh comedy's dirtiest dozen and the aristocrats and the thing called rules for  men that's three films fucking look at that underground movie stars yeah  just the aristocrats great flick yeah i love that great fun i never knew it was going to get  released i thought we was just crapping around nobody nobody knew yeah no you know they came  into your apartment with a with a camera like hey you know talk about this professor said oh i got to 
[02:08:00]  put you in this movie because uh you told me the joke 30 years ago yeah the aristocrats was great  i didn't even tell a joke you know i just i just fucked around and talked and told a few jokes i was  against it i didn't i'm not really a joke teller and i don't find that joke that hilarious but he  convinced me to do it because he said all the a-list stars were in it and what's you know it was  a whole goof it was a whole fun thing yeah because it was a it was a fun thing to fuck  around with a million years ago and in the movie i actually recreated what i i decided i was going to 
[02:08:30]  quit stand up on the road because i thought i had a chance of getting doing more on the stern  show i was working two days a week and nancy said just stop going on the road and you'll be  available and when i quit going on the road then i was available to be there five days a week  and when i made the decision i was at zaney's in nashville and i said this is my last week i'm  not fucking coming out on the road anymore so i got so drunk and i was telling the joke to somebody  and when i got to the punchline i literally ran and slid on my belly you know in the in the  shit and the diarrhea you know and i recreated that but it was it was so much fun to tell that joke 
[02:09:00]  and that they didn't go to the interesting the interesting part of that  was the the guy legman with the big thick book that they talked about oh yeah his his premise  was that you are defined by what you find funny which is a real interesting premise and he had two  huge joke books he was a big collector he was a madman and the last joke on the last page  was the aristocrats and i had been telling that joke for years before i discovered that was the 
[02:09:30]  last joke because that uh movie hasn't been out in a while could you like uh bring in the audience a  little more uh it's an old vaudeville joke basically it's it's it's just a ridiculous  show and i laughed at the wrong thing for years right the wrong thing let me just say so yeah go  ahead so the bottom line is here's this aristocrats joke that's my favorite joke that i've been telling  to people and this is like 1980 and here it is and he says the the following joke was told to me  by a guy who was raised in squalor by two battling parents but they stayed together for 40 years 
[02:10:00]  battling for the good of the children and i'm like they just described my motherfucking  childhood and this is my favorite joke it's completely you know it made what is his premise  absolutely on on the money and in the movie the aristocrats that old music the old magician oh told  the gershon legman version of the joke which was much shorter and i think if it gets too long it 
[02:10:30]  gets lost and gets crazy but the bottom line is a guy when i tell this joke and that they said it  in the aristocrats when i tell this joke i'd say that that the guy goes to a low-level show business  agent and i say when i tell this joke i always picture joe franklin's office and in the movie they  actually cut the joe franklin's office joe franklin and what's so funny joe franklin had an office where  you could hardly walk in because it's all full of crap i know and then he moved and i'm like how could  they possibly move and he moved to a different place a hoarder it's exactly the same it's they  moved all that crap right but the guy goes and says this is for the audience so they hear the joke 
[02:11:00]  he says uh like you want to tell it you don't you don't like that no i can't the guy's gonna have  stuff here the guy goes to show business agent he says i got an act i'd like you to look at the  acting and the guy's well there's no room there my office come out in the hall so they go out in the  hall and he stands there and the guy goes around the corner he comes back around the corner  he goes down and he takes out his dick and starts whacking his dick and then he goes back around  the corner all of a sudden he comes back around the corner with his wife and then he's got his 
[02:11:30]  dick and then all of a sudden he rips off her blouse starts playing with the tits and he's playing with  his dick you know he goes back around the corner and all of a sudden comes around the corner he's  got his mother and his father with him you know and they come back and they're french kissing and  making out and his father starts fingering his mother and he starts he's jacking off and he's playing  with his wife's just and all of a sudden they go back around and then they come back around and it's the  the grandmother and the mother and it's the guy and his wife and they're all naked and the kids  come out and the guy takes his shit and then takes his son and pushes his son's face in the  shit and then pisses on the back of his son's head and his and his sister starts playing and 
[02:12:00]  they're all waddling in the shit and waddling in the shit and all of a sudden they go  he says the agent what do you think the agent says it's different what do you call yourself  but they get into the whole thing with you know kids dying and everything well the joke is told  differently by a million different guys that's that's the key to the joke with the punchline  being the same every time it's very long it has a dynamic though where you'll be like all right 
[02:12:30]  where's he going but then the longer it gets after that it gets funny again it's like a shaggy dog  yeah yeah it's like how much patience are you you know how much you're going to invest with  somebody yeah are you on a car ride where you want to eat up a half hour you know right right it's  it's well done the documentary on the joke because i think gilbert's was really he fucking twisted  oh man he really went off on it and then yeah he's fucking the boy like yeah yeah gilbert's  performance was awesome in that it was great oh yeah he fucking he was wasn't he like the 
[02:13:00]  first what's wrong what did i do i don't just makes me laugh what's what i don't think you  remember the magician before when jackie said like the magician i went oh  he's just agreeing it was just i have no concept of who the magician no  catch up later you know process at least oh that was such a great  he's comfortable here very comfortable jimmy just doesn't believe a fucking thing i said i love i 
[02:13:30]  used to promise dinners with people yeah well dinner so many fuck he's the greatest dismisser of things  hey i really love you okay thank you okay before they're finished he's nodding and dismissing them  i i feel more comfortable with scorn than praise i just i don't know what's coming next when somebody  praises me it makes me uncomfortable yeah i don't know how to react yeah it's all right it's just  like yeah thanks mothering it's like oh thank you thank you or just say good i really enjoy your 
[02:14:00]  stuff and then just leave me alone yeah because the the multiple compliment is very uncomfortable  because you got to go oh thank you thank you go thank you and then it's something else and you  oh no i really appreciate that oh thank you thank you not that it happens all the time  starts to water it down yeah yeah yeah it's like after a while you're just like shut the fuck up  i really appreciate the concise compliment and then just leave me alone move on yeah well because  so often somebody say you were so great i really loved you thank you you know it was really good 
[02:14:30]  yeah thank you yeah except for you know and then all of a sudden they get to the but the but this  the real reason why they're talking yeah right right or else they'll say you didn't you left out my  favorite joke and you just had what you consider a great set and then they'll fucking say well you  didn't do the one thing that i came here to hear i'm sorry i fucking ruined your night  that's right turn the sound back on and go up do the one joke for you so long ago on the  fort lauderdale comic strip we used to everybody was the same as well it's like 79 and 80 there was 
[02:15:00]  no in the very beginning there was no headliner and middle and opening act there was three guys  did a show at the comic strip in fort and we do the show of joe balazzo's no no this is joe  mullen long before balazzo said it joe mullen yeah bob woods used to always talk about that  joe mullen was the all-time great guy he's the guy that threw the guy out and then threw his  wheelchair out on top of him oh and and he's mr compassion wow did he really oh like oh the  fucking stories about the guy but but we get done with the show and we'd be sitting in the bar the 
[02:15:30]  three comics and the people be filtering out and it was always so fucking uncomfortably great because  you'd be sitting there and people always would like one guy or two guys and maybe not all three  and they'd go oh you were so great oh you were so great and then look at me and sometimes they'd  love me and sometimes they'd like the other two guys and i'd be too dirty and they'd like look at  me and just they walk by and you're all so uncomfortable man compliment the other two and 
[02:16:00]  then just stare you oh god that's fucking rude shit unbelievable you stunk but a lot of times they  just don't recognize me because they were watching the puppet but i'll take it personally  like they won't even know that i was just on stage i remember one time we were in the  stare at george me and auto were in the parking lot one time in delaware and then we actually  hooked up with girls at that gig uh i remember with wendy and the other chick yeah the only time  me and auto ever fucking hooked up with chicks i was just saying she must have been good 1988 
[02:16:30]  we were in the parking lot and this girl comes up to us and she had um her there was something  wrong with her head because her fucking literally her hairline started almost in the middle of her  skull she had like a fucking almost a neanderthal ridge too much fucking forehead oh she was terrible  wow it was a drive-in movie but uh we were uh she came up and she goes uh i liked to me she goes i  liked you a lot um you were really funny and i don't think she knew and she goes i liked you better 
[02:17:00]  than the headliner oh but she was she liked out but she was he was just too dirty i think he's more  of a guy's come and i forget what she said to you and you said well i kind of like you too except for  your forehead it was too big and she took her palm and she palmed auto in the forehead  had you a fucker no yeah he didn't have a car exactly we were gonna get a fucker in we did pick up  girls and we were in the and the girl had talked about her grandfather committing suicide and he had 
[02:17:30]  jumped out a window and it was very sad yeah so we're in her kitchen and we're getting ready to  win the jacuzzi and there's a picture of an old man on the refrigerator and auto goes hey is this the  one who tossed himself out the window it's one of my top five biggest laughs ever and you still want  to toss himself out the window and you guys still got action after that dude that's pretty amazing  we fooled around but we fooled around with them in the in the jacuzzi and i was doing a lot better 
[02:18:00]  than he was and and he goes look at those two they're like melrose place and we're like meet the  press he was on fucking fire that night it was more fun making you laugh than trying to get a nut  oh did i fucking howl that night that was it was the toss is the word of course is this the one who  tossed himself out the window what an excellent choice of a woman it was a short bereavement 
[02:18:30]  how do you guys pick up girls and how does it get to by the way my father committed suicide  suicide i don't know how it got i honestly don't remember the process i wouldn't remember the  night if it wasn't for those horrible moments that's what made it memorable those terrible  moments they were like an hour south of fucking uh nice jacuzzi yeah it was okay it was a pool it  was a pool jacuzzi in their underwear or naked or what i don't remember i don't remember i don't 
[02:19:00]  remember no i'd remember we were all in the jacuzzi right at some point yeah i think so and you guys  were just chatting while me and her were fooling around that was her name was sheila the girl i  fooled around yep i remember her last name too i don't say yeah you know bob woods was bob woods  was so huge yeah he must have weighed like 350 another comic obviously yeah but but he used to get  girls and it was amazing because he was so gruff and so disgusting and so ornery and that place  mr rips upstate you know so him and jim myers are up at this place mr rips myers this is myers 
[02:19:30]  favorite it's not even that great a story it's just so odd if you picture this huge man in the  front seat with a girl and myers is in the back seat trying to fuck this girl and all of a sudden  out of a clueless guy this 350 pound man says to the woman he's with get your finger out of my  assholes myers couldn't believe it this huge man is lucky enough that the girl took her finger and 
[02:20:00]  he's yelling at me he's yelling at me she must have a long finger i don't even know how she could have  negotiated it you know oh it's so great oh fuck yeah he was like you know him you know it's true  he was he had he would blow his stack he was hysterical you would you will believe this story  you guys won't believe this story but you will believe this story he was so big that when he  was in the front seat in i mean you know in the passenger seat of my volvo he his legs he took up 
[02:20:30]  the entire area and we're coming back from mr rips and he had so many problems so many problems and  he had a bottle of heineken and he's the kind of guy the cop would pull you over and he'd say let's  kick his ass you know so he's sitting there grab his gun and we're driving right and we've been  we've gone to gigs for years so we're done talking we've talked about everything forever and ever now  so we're just driving and driving and driving so we're on our way back from mr rips and woods is 
[02:21:00]  sitting there with like a half a bottle of heineken and he's sitting there and all of a sudden he he  starts to deeply sob really and and freaking out and and all of a sudden he's crying and he  hits the window to put the window down and he pulls but the window didn't go all the way down  and he throws the heineken out the window but the window isn't completely open and the heineken bottle 
[02:21:30]  bounces off the window and caroms around but he's so fat and big that it lands  so it's still upright somewhere and some of the crevasse is sitting there and a few minutes go by  and all of a sudden he's he starts giggling and laughing and he grabs the heineken bottle  that's still got beer and takes a sip out of me and turns to me he says sorry pal  i tell the entire gamut of emotion i almost drove off the fucking road it was an amazing play 
[02:22:00]  i assume he didn't make it no he's gone he's gone what did he die and i never met his name  you know i knew he was and i never met him he was a very very big guy and he he was just a mess and  he collapsed on stage in maryland and they took him to the hospital and cut him open and they just  sent him back to his room to die that was just wow it was too much stomach to cut through to get  to whatever organ just really what year was that like it must have been early 90s 89 or something 
[02:22:30]  before i got on the guy went from his wake to replacing him at some gig in in long island it  was the hardest thing i ever did i'd never been to a wake in my life and and it was just it was so sad  it was just bizarre bizarre you know and then having to go do a show it was awful we loved him he was  like our fucking he was the guy you always look forward to doing a gig with you laugh all the way  there and all the way back the first night i ever worked with the gang i i had met minavenia and those  guys and they convinced me to come over to dixon's white house in yeah and went over to dixon's white 
[02:23:00]  house in like in 1979 in in the beginning of 1979 and dixon had his face surgically changed to look  like richard m dixon and that's fucked up and he just what he just oh i remember that and he had a place  called richard m dixon's white house in and you know and he that was his place and he and it had a  variety show the reason we started we wound up doing a comedy show on long island in huntington  at cinnamon was that dixon wouldn't pay us he wouldn't give us any money so they convinced me to come  over so i came over and it's the first night i met woods and the only thing dixon would give us was 
[02:23:30]  free booze so here i am with bob woods with two drunks and i'm meeting him for the first time so  we're sitting there at the bar long after the show's over drinking and drinking and dixon's  trying to get us you know he wants us to leave so dixon takes a bus box and he's going around and  he's cleaning up the tables you know and i'm sitting there with woods and i said i think we got to go  bob he says why i said i'm so drunk now the fucking bus boys are starting to look like nixon  he said you're all right pal we were best friends until he died best friends until he died 
[02:24:00]  yeah that was a bad idea giving him a free liquor as opposed to hey i mean he could do some damage  him and hawthorne would drink so much you remember dave hawthorne yeah hawthorne the walrus  man he'd grab his dick and go walrus walrus and and friedman um uh silver friedman at the improv hated  us because we would just be laughing we didn't kiss her ass for spots and we would we'd be laughing  she goes could you guys keep it down and woods is like it's a comedy club i'm laughing  she's like you have to laugh laugh like a horse and then he started that set him off again for 10 
[02:24:30]  minutes a laugh oh he's just a fuck and she liked all those douchey little paul riser uh kiss ass  comics that would fucking you know suck up to her and do her little bidding it was such a fucking  woods and hawthorne the night i opened governor's i was like i walked in the men's room and woods  quoted this for 10 years i walked out and said jesus fucking god are you donkey smoking pot in the  men's the smoking pot opening night governor's the smoking pot in the men's room just to break my  ball they didn't want to get high they just want to fuck with me you know oh man here's god what a

[02:30:30]  block he didn't work for any particular restaurant or anything and it was like in the middle of the  summer during the day and it was this drunk jewish guy who was just going into every business like  with a budweiser and just you know flirting with the girls and just being a jerk but not really out  of line and he was leaning on a car and drinking a bottle of budweiser fat anthony his hand came from  like florida and it was like the size of the screen and it just he drove the bottle into his teeth and 
[02:31:00]  the punch followed through and it was just a sickening sight and me and mulrooney saw the whole thing  we went he's gonna anthony's gonna do something he punched a bottle into his teeth yeah just but with a  hand the size of a microwave oven and then just bam and then just collapsed on the ground and uh  nobody saw nothing he just laid there he just turned away the guy was never the same we saw him  like six months later and he was like you know just a fucking old nervous crazy neck of the woods  what a punch that is disgusting those are the old days where like you'd always you were constantly 
[02:31:30]  reading in the paper about you know a joey the horse uh the bottle exploded into dust there was  nothing left of it it was just a heyday you wonder if these places really existed and this and there  it is yeah yeah fat anthony had enough of him and his fucking flooding with the girls had enough of him  that that show that we did that was that was great fun they did a movie about uh doing a show to raise  money to save a club but they did the movie to raise money to save the club it was kind of show

[02:37:30]  jackie the joke man in studio and otto and george were well just otto george's uh back home i guess  there's a story i don't know if you told me or somebody told me about uh the the the gist of it  is jesus weed do you remember that story about getting pulled over and then having and having 
[02:38:00]  like homegrown pot do you that's not enough of this you know you haven't narrowed it down enough  what i heard was that the the guy you you got pulled over and you had like an ounce of pot right  there and then i got pulled over yeah oh go ahead and the cop was like what what's that oh man it's  pot i'm lost i'm so fucking so you were just honest with the guy and like talk your way out of it by  just saying look if you're not a girl with big tits being like brutally honest is your only chance of 
[02:38:30]  getting away with it but then you said you said to the cop that it's we call it jesus weed it's homegrown  he goes what do you what's jesus weed mean he goes you smoke it and you pray you get high  and then the guy said all right you guys are comedians open the trunk if i don't find any  more grass i'm gonna let you go that that doesn't ring a bell that does not you know but so many  stupid things happen that you know that's too good a story i mean yeah but i'm not going to say it  didn't happen because i want the story to keep getting yeah that's a good story well jackie was just  telling us when he knew he had a drinking problem you brought up something we were talking about 
[02:39:00]  drinking we used to drink on our way to go to drink so if you're going to a bar or going to a  gig or something like that uh we would bring beer it was normal the drive it was normal for to drive  around with a beer between your legs as you're driving and just drink not thinking like what the  fuck am i going to do with this if i get pulled over like what am i going to where am i going to  drive along and take a beer and open it with another beer upside down yeah yeah so easily i mean  that was just tell the story when you knew you had a drinking problem well and that was probably 
[02:39:30]  years before but um anytime you're going out we'd always want to be on time because we wouldn't want  to you know miss happy hour and god forbid you know and i would always get the happy hour and then  ask for you know a couple of extra drinks so you'd have something so you wouldn't have to wait for  the waiter to come to the table and take your order you know all these little tricks you thought  they were tricks but i would have a beer ready to go you know i'd open a beer and  when we were getting ready to leave and very often your wife isn't ready i'm like what are you 
[02:40:00]  doing what are you doing so i'm standing sipping my beer and sipping my beer and she's not ready yet  all of a sudden my beer is half gone and i'm like well fuck this isn't enough beer to get me somewhere  and i'm not going to bring an excellent one in my pocket i don't want to piss her off so i would  go downstairs and finish the beer i was drinking and put it in the refrigerator the empty because i'll take  care of it later and take it i'd get another beer out and i mean she's two floors away but just to  be careful i'd cough and and pop the pop top and come up so i'd be on my second one and we'd be on 
[02:40:30]  the way you know yeah and it was and it was very funny because we never i mean every time you got  done with dinner or whatever and then they come around with the coffee and i would never ever have a  cup of coffee no i would you know i would have another drink yeah he's dad you gotta the last  the last time i ever drank i was uh at a christening in in may of 2001 and we're at this christening and 
[02:41:00]  the waitress came around and was a real low level christening so she had the the the coffee thing in  one hand and i and i you know a pitcher of beer in the other hand you know not the classiest joint you  know and she's coming around and she's you know filling up the coffee and filling people's beers  and i pushed my beer glass back and put my coffee cup in front of me and nancy looked at me like she  was sitting with a fucking alien yeah and she said what are you doing i said i'm done wow just like 
[02:41:30]  that she said what are you talking about i said i'm done and and that was it that was it what what  clicked in there i had gone to he was done drinking beer out of mugs he started coffee  i had gone to memphis the week before we had gotten so drunk and i just would spend the whole  day just waiting for it to be five o'clock so i could start drinking i was like you know what  and i was off the stern show and i had way too much fucking free time i'm like when are you going to not 
[02:42:00]  drink you know when you have to get up at 4 30 in the morning you know you couldn't go you know  you'd still get pretty crazy pretty often but um at least that was some kind of governor i mean  that's the search i saved my life it was 15 years that i had to be somewhere every morning you know  but uh i just was done and and i have no idea how or why i didn't go to aa or anything i just and  everybody said well then you didn't have a problem i'm like trust me i had a fucking problem no big  like uh bottom you didn't reach this point where it was like oh i gotta go you just decided at that 
[02:42:30]  moment that was it well we got we we were at that party but we were we were separated you know  you took stock of yourself yeah no well you know i moved to pick yourself up by your bootstraps  i moved to the house by myself i quit drinking got divorced quit the show i mean there was so much  wrong that you know it was such a fucking major hiccup that like who the fuck knew how long after  you quit the show did you quit drinking uh what is it a couple months oh it was that close  march well but i knew i had to quit right away and obviously the show made you drink 
[02:43:00]  you know it's one of those things i got divorced and everybody oh nancy left jackie because he left  the show you know we were we're going to be split up years before that but there was no way i was  going to go through a divorce and be on the show oh my god i would have been just too brutal hey you  getting any fresh pussy you know you know yeah and uh so when you and i know i had to quit but but  you know that's a tough thing and you know it's it's in the back of your mind it's like the little  guy back there going you know one of these days because i quit for a year like in 1990 or something 
[02:43:30]  and i said yeah i could quit anytime now i know i could quit anytime i said wait jackie that was 10  fucking years ago you know did you have withdrawals no i didn't go through anything nothing you didn't  have a problem yeah but you know and that's what everybody says i'm like all right you know but i and  when i tell tell myself i didn't have a problem i say that's my way of trying to sneak myself back  into yeah just uh one beer that's all it's so funny i was at a new year's eve party a couple 
[02:44:00]  years after i quit and i was at a new year's eve party out in the midwest somewhere and some girl  was standing there and everybody was drunk and somebody took champagne and she had a very low cut  and a lot of cleavage and somebody poured champagne down her cleavage without even thinking not going  for the booze i i licked the champagne between the tits just without even thinking and all every  cell of my body's like wow we're drinking again we're drinking again because i wasn't thinking in  terms of the booze i was just being outrageous it was like popeye with the spinach like 
[02:44:30]  wow shit but yeah we always drank it you know yeah that was part of like just driving around  i had a 1961 chrysler imperial which was the year of the remember the fins got bigger and bigger and  bigger and that was when they topped out it was just the ugliest biggest baby blue car with a  the trunk was big enough that you could have a fucking orgy in it and and there was a back shelf  and we actually had a plastic bus box from piping rock country club there and the thing there was it 
[02:45:00]  was a fancy car and it was a thing it was old but it was a fancy car and there was a thing in the  back that pulled down an armrest and we ripped out the leather and ripped a hole in the cardboard and  we'd put beer on ice in the bus box we called it our james bond and we go out and park the car and  drink and then reach through the thing to get beer and you know you put your empties in there too  no toss them out the window toss them out the window yeah we were idiots the beer would be in the trunk  of the car and you would be and we got pulled over one time the cop was like you know we're parking in 
[02:45:30]  the middle of nowhere and where's the beer and one of the guys freaked out and said it's it's in the  back and bob bishop and the guy opened and you but you couldn't see it the trunk was so big and it  was a shelf he said what are you a wise guy and there was no it was like we got away with it once it  was like incredible it's it's not a believable story but if you see it you know i never think  nowadays it's the you got the internet you could google it it's 61 chrisis imperial and see how  fucking huge you know that's one of the last things i would ever google  but i'm saying it's a real good thing for uh verifying stories you know yeah but yeah drinking 
[02:46:00]  and driving you of course that's what you did like i remember driving i was going to the um  patchog uh uh marina out there to catch a boat over uh to the to fire island and i had a case of  beer on my passenger seat and i'm just taking cans from it popping it drinking them and i got pulled  over for speeding on the expressway oh and uh the cop actually gave me a breathalyzer he did i think i 
[02:46:30]  blew like a 0.7 and and i think drunk legally was was one at that right right right it wasn't 0.8  um and he goes yeah he goes i could hold you here a little longer and make you do this again to see if  you know you've been because you've been drinking he goes but uh i'll let you go go ahead and i had a  case of beer in the passenger seat i'm drinking as i'm speeding down the expressway and he's like all  right go ahead now forget about it is the act of having beer on ice illegal in itself or do you  have no you can have it can't be open there just can't be an open container and and you know of 
[02:47:00]  course i i had that i never gave thought to like all right if it's empty you could stash it on the  seat or something right but if you have half a beer and you get pulled over where are you putting  this oh you just never thought about it was like i'm not i won't get pulled over yeah in the 60s it  was crazy i mean they'd pull you over and you'd roll the window down the cop go oh jesus christ  can you get this thing home you know it was unbelievable you know i'm fine i'm fine okay  get the fuck out of here drive fast so you get there quick it wasn't even a law in the books until 
[02:47:30]  like what like 25 years ago right before that i don't i don't know if it was a law we got through  the 80s too with some crazy stuff what you have to do back then for them to actually really had to  bring in yeah you had to be like drunk and kill someone and plowing over one of the greatest  take a shot at hoover you talk about and even after like well whatever you talk about  letting you get away i remember i came home from college one one christmas or one summer and it 
[02:48:00]  was quarter the drinking the the bars used to be open until three and in the late 60s the bars were  packed until they threw you out nowadays i drive through oyster bay at 12 o'clock at night  and the place is on friday it's a ghost town i'm like what where's everybody what's going on and  because in the old days so here i come home from college and it's quarter to three and we're at the  the local the homestead in oyster bay we're at the restaurant and it's quarter to three and i said hey 
[02:48:30]  you know we better line them up and they said what are you talking about i said you know come on it's  quarter to three you know you you line up your drinks because the bar is gonna close yeah they said no  no no they they changed the law i said what are you talking about they changed the law till four  o'clock and i said what fucking legislator sat there and said all right these guys get drunk till three  in the morning you know what they do have an outside chance of making it home alive let's change the  law till four o'clock in the morning it's absurd they moved it back a fucking hour and they had to 
[02:49:00]  change they changed the law yeah some of those laws uh we always talk about the strippers yeah uh  whenever you get strippers that uh because they have full nude in some places but long island it's  always the bottom and topless uh you know you never see any pussy occasionally it's some of the  sleazier joints but it's illegal and shit like that you gotta go to jersey yeah yeah but they made a law  and and you have to know when that law is made that it's made for good because there's not one guy 
[02:49:30]  that's gonna run on the platform of and we're gonna get the fucking panties off of these strippers  you're gonna see some pussy if i'm elected you better really think about those laws because  there's no taking that one back it's gone forever it's got you're never seeing pussy on long island  in a strip club it just ain't gonna happen because no politician can run on that platform and there's  so many laws i vote for them there's laws like you can have full naked girls if you don't have booze but  if you have booze you can't and then you can send people out to buy your own bottle of booze in 
[02:50:00]  some place is it a bad thing that we can't see the pussies though long island strip club yes it is  man i don't care i would rather i don't care there were some there were some rough fucking strippers  on the day shift in a week fucking the brass monkey or fucking uh down at uh frogs in in smith town  there's nobody in the first three rows i don't want to get too close i would cover my beer wow i  would put my hands over my dog it would be like i would i would go up on my elbows like i was getting 
[02:50:30]  closer to get a better look really but i was covering the top of my beer because she was walking on the  bar yeah i didn't want any fucking crabs or whatever fall into my rear just to order a beer in a clothes  flatbed away from my wrangles it was terrible curtains these girls would go by but and it was  always uh when i was growing i'd go into a tit bar grilled cheese and bologna oh god  and you'd have you'd have to you know you'd have to put some money up the beers were expensive and  shit but i didn't have a lot of money so you'd have to sit next to the guy that had a stack of bills 
[02:51:00]  right right because the girls would get in front of him and do the fucking dance and shit and you'd kind  of you know you yeah you could sap off of him sponge off of his dollars because you're seeing  everything i could give a shit if she's making eye contact with me that's okay that's a very good  point i'm a whore fucking ronkonkoma what's the name of that place bird's place ronkonkoma that's  where all the motorcycle guys went yeah oh and they they would do anything there because they'd pull  they'd pull the fucking g-string aside just show the carousel right bush carousel is still open 
[02:51:30]  still is that right i've been down there a couple i was i think the last time i was there i was uh  it was uh christmas eve at my uh aunt and uncle's house and i was getting hammered there and and they  live like off of uh like cedar road over there in uh uh elwood and i'm driving back home to nassau  county and i'm i'm like i wonder if the carousel's open christmas fucking eve they're open i go in  there i'm half in the bag christmas eve and just to see who's in the strip club at christmas eve

[02:52:30]  my guitar and tell my dirty jokes and i was really horrible i was trying to quit the band  but i didn't make the move to comedy yet so i'm working at this place the hungry bear which is a  single storefront in huntington and there's a scottish bartender and there's like two or  three drunks at the bar and i'm at the other end playing my songs and telling my dirty jokes but it's  like two days before christmas anybody with any kind of family or heart at all is christmas shopping and  buying trees and doing everything and there's a couple lonely drunks and the bartender at the  other end and i'm trying to be cheery and i'm playing a song telling joke playing a song and 
[02:53:00]  the guy says something to me and i gave him the exact perfect straight line i still want to shoot  myself i'm playing singing telling joke please sing don't joke between jokes and the bartender says  jack they want you outside and i said who he said everybody  i still don't like telling that story

[03:01:00]  yeah well it's a whole different world though the fcc i don't worry about at all even if i was on  regular radio it's it's the people running the radio yeah you can't incite way more than the fcc right  yeah yeah the special interest groups and all the fucking pussies that run the radio stations  you don't want to incite the wrong people way worse than the fcc really yeah at the end of our  careers on uh commercial radio that was that was a joke the fc that we didn't worry about the fcc  didn't matter you can say cut but you can't say jesus yeah we were worried about the asians 
[03:01:30]  special interest groups and all that those were the ones getting people fired not the fcc so whatever  wow yeah oh god we don't need that type of humor anyway the type that denigrates other  people there's a lot of ways to have fun if you have to do that trash talking yeah we don't need  that type of stuff no you know i michigan state i was a uh a um student assistant for a while which  meant you led the you know they had the the lectures on the television in this classroom because it's  such a huge university and you'd be in charge of plug it in the television turn it on the show
