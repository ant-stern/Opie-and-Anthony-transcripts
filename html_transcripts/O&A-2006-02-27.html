<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, featuring Kevin Smith as a guest throughout the entire broadcast, began with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their characteristically vulgar banter directed at their staff, Ben and Steve.  The show quickly transitioned to broadcasting a live, uncensored sexual encounter between a couple known only as "Map of Hawaii" on Paltalk. Opie, Jim, and Kevin Smith provided running commentary on the act.  Following the encounter, the hosts interviewed Map of Hawaii, who disclosed their occupations and motivations for their online performance, mentioning plans to visit Opie's restaurant, F.H. Riley's.

The conversation then shifted to Kevin Smith's career, encompassing his views on films like *War of the Worlds*, *Brokeback Mountain*, *Mission Impossible 3*, and *Bad News Bears*, with graphic descriptions of *Brokeback Mountain*'s sex scenes.  He discussed his work on *Green Hornet*, a brief appearance in *Spider-Man*, video game addiction (mentioning *EverQuest* and a Ben Stein anecdote), and the challenges of independent filmmaking, including the MPAA rating system and dealing with online criticism.  The difficulties of getting his film "Vulgar" distributed were also discussed, alongside his collaboration with Jason Lee on *My Name is Earl* and the upcoming release of *Clerks 2*.  Several callers phoned in, one recounting a love story linked to Smith's films, and another representing a fan website.  Smith detailed a secret screening of *Clerks 2* for Harvey Weinstein.

The show continued with Smith discussing a *Clerks 2* screening for fans from the Opie and Anthony website, acknowledging concerns about audience bias. The hosts then launched into crude humor about satellite radio, its lack of commercial breaks and restrooms.  A significant portion focused on Atlantic City casinos, detailing both positive (Borgata) and negative (Caesars) experiences, including discussions about prostitution. Smith shared his struggles with Jason Mewes' heroin addiction, his involvement in interventions and rehab attempts.  Further tangents included discussions about *Jersey Girl*'s challenges due to its stars' high-profile relationship, opinions on films like *Casablanca*, *History of Violence*, *Murderball*, and *Gigli*, a well-made fan film combining *Batman*, *Predator*, and *Aliens*, the poorly-received *White Chicks Incorporated*, and Smith's experiences in Vancouver, contrasting the prostitution scene of the early 90s with the later crystal meth scene. A caller asked about an Indiana show shutdown during a Kevin Smith Q&A, revealing an outraged audience.

A later segment featured Smith discussing a friend's successful heroin recovery and his subsequent increased Red Bull consumption, which spurred his renewed interest in filmmaking, leading to a *Clerks* sequel. He shared anecdotes about his creative process, mentioned the upcoming *Clerks* DVD and his *Silent Bob Talks* show.  A caller complimented a line from *Mallrats* and referenced Smith's story about his first sexual experience.  The discussion then turned to celebrity reality TV, particularly the Olympics and *Flavor of Love*. Smith expressed disdain for most reality TV, finding *Flavor of Love* amusing for its lack of politeness, playing audio clips of explicit arguments and insults between contestants.  The hosts analyzed the show's appeal and low budget, discussing the desperation of celebrities for fame and money.  They also touched upon the history of violent reality TV and similar themes in films such as *The Running Man*.

The hosts then reacted humorously and sarcastically to their show's absence from Talkers Magazine's "Heavy 100" list for 2005, making derogatory comments about many listed shows and personalities.  A call with Gunnar Nelson, a *Celebrity Fit Club* participant, followed, discussing his weight loss journey, interactions with contestants (Kelly LeBrock, Tempestt Bledsoe), and the show's challenges. Smith also discussed his "Fat Smash Diet."

Another segment, featuring Dr. Ian Smith along with Kevin Smith, centered on *Celebrity Fit Club*, focusing on the participants' successes and failures (Tempestt Bledsoe, Jeff Conway, Young MC, Bazaar, Kelly LeBrock, Chaz Bono, Countess Vaughn). Dr. Smith promoted his diet plan, Fatsmashdiet.com. The conversation included tangents on angry emails about the show, a humorous anecdote about Jeff Conway and Benadryl, explicit emails received by the hosts, one host's experiences in Brazilian brothels, a shocking news story about a man drinking children's urine, the hosts' experiences with Paltalk and a woman flashing her breasts ("Beach Bunny"), and discussions about other *Celebrity Fit Club* participants like Gary Busey and Harvey. The segment concluded with a trucker seeking weight loss advice and a conversation with Kevin Smith about his weight loss surgery and recovery.

[00:00:00]  To be continued... 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the coffee?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, the show has begun.  Wow.  And it's not the Opie and Anthony Show that we're talking about. 
[00:04:30]  What the fuck?  Well, that's what video conferencing's all about, isn't it, Opie?  That's right.  Hi, welcome, good morning.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Blah, blah, blah, sound effects, sound effects, sound effects, blah, blah, blah.  Let's get right into it.  Yeah.  First of all, we've got to say hi to Kevin Smith, who's in studio.  He just stopped by to say hi.  Hi, Kevin.  Good morning.  He just walked into all sorts of things here.  Yeah.  That's not a bad thing to walk into.  That's good, right?  Walk in the room, look at these two people talking. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, they're just banging away on here.  Map of Hawaii is their name.  They're on the Pal Talk.  We have our own Pal Talk room.  It's Opie and Anthony live.  So everyone can see this?  Yeah, yeah.  And we have a camera right up there.  No, no, the fuck show.  It looks over the whole thing.  Yeah, the fuck show.  It's very important.  Because everyone's watching.  Nobody's watching.  No one's watching.  The studio portion right now.  No.  Oh my God, look at this dude.  They have this picture up full size, full screen.  I gotta tell you, it's a tough decision though.  Hmm.  Check out Kevin Smith on the Opie and Anthony program or a couple fucking. 
[00:05:30]  Let's look at a sausage party room full of dudes.  Right.  Or this dude actually getting a chick.  Well, I'm looking at the office cam at Steve's smiling face right there in the office doing.  No work is being done in the office right now.  He wishes he was her.  Well, this started with an email over the weekend from E-Rock.  Yeah.  And E-Rock brought it to our attention that this fine couple would be having sex live on our show today with their Pal Talk camera.  Yes.  The whole show?  The whole show or just as long until he's done? 
[00:06:00]  As long as he lasts.  Really?  That's a very good question.  I don't know.  He was doing a good portion of eating out before he even started to do it.  A little foreplay.  Yeah.  Foreplay while Ecstasy of Gold was playing.  Advertising himself as a generous lover.  Right.  Right.  He gives a little.  Smart move.  He gives a little.  And then now he's got her.  She's on her back.  Her legs are up.  It's an uncomfortable looking place, though.  She's on a table.  I mean, I understand it's a...  Kitchen table.  Yeah, but they just threw a sheet over it.  Not... 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, what's up with the table?  That's why he ate her out.  He's making up for the fucking table.  I think as far as direction goes, it's probably a better location than the bedroom.  It beats the bed, too, because the bed, you kind of sink it to the mattress a bit.  Yeah.  This is a better view.  A better view of everything.  You're not losing anything by sinking in.  How many people are in the pal talk room?  I don't know right now.  I think the numbers are going to go way up all of a sudden.  That is fantastic.  I would say maybe 300, 400 are in the room right now, but those numbers are going to  go up very fast. 
[00:07:00]  The thought behind it, I mean, somebody actually had to set their alarms to wake up, probably  take a shower, get all ready, and then get to the fucking.  They were just 319.  Now there's 352.  It's leaps and bounds here.  It keeps slipping out.  Kevin, you're a big-time director.  What do you think?  I mean, are they directing this out well?  I think it's shot pretty well.  That's how I would shoot it.  Still camera, no action.  Still camera, no moves.  Things happen in front of it.  You like the lighting and everything? 
[00:07:30]  You know, I go for a bit.  I really bathe it in tons of light so you can get all those shadows out of there and see  everything.  Yeah, he's getting a few reflections off the window.  She's a pretty large labia.  It's really lovely.  And he's keeping the boom mic out of the shot.  Oh, there you go.  You're ruining it, dude.  You're ruining it.  He's got a microscope in the apartment.  We saw that.  Well, it's not like he's on a dolly and can really kind of move this around.  That's true.  He's multitasking.  Give him a break, kids.  Can we get their audio or what? 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  Sometimes you can get their audio.  Well, we can give it a try.  Hey, Mapa Hawaii, I will give you the audio.  Let's see.  By the way, his chick is very fine.  She's all right.  She is kind of attractive.  Because when E-Rock said that a couple want to have sex with the pal talk camera today,  I was like,  uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  But, uh, no, they're-  You have attractive fans.  You have attractive fans.  If I had a couple fans, fucking-  All right, here we go.  Let me go over here.  All right, this is live audio as they have sex. 
[00:08:30]  So it's kind of hard to have a conversation.  Yeah.  See, now the pressure's on to produce some dialogue.  Yeah, it was great when it was just pictures.  Totally, totally.  All right, we got some action. 
[00:09:00]  There you go.  She's turning it up a little bit.  Wow.  I think the whole world needs to get pal talk.  What, what, what can I do?  I can, oh, I can pop it.  I got it.  Oh, good.  I like watching people have sex.  Oh, God.  Isn't that great?  Kind of an understatement, but yeah.  I got it real sick. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  Kind of watches that cheek.  Look at Steve's face in the office.  I'm checking out the accent.  I'm checking out Steve in the office.  No one is working.  Is that it?  Oh, was that it?  I don't think so.  Oh, girl.  I think, oh, yeah, a little loving.  That's nice.  A little loving.  That means it's over.  We'll make it out. 
[00:10:00]  There must be some love there to be like, honey, we're going to fuck on pal talk.  Well done, kids.  Well done.  All right.  Huzzah.  What a way to start the Opie and Anthony program.  Very nice.  That is fantastic.  Wow.  Big tit shot on the camera.  And the family doesn't know when they come over to have Thanksgiving dinner that that took  place on their table.  That's great.  The turkey's great.  And cut.  Did I do well, Kevin?  Not bad.  I would keep rolling in case something else happens. 
[00:10:30]  You never know, right?  Yeah.  Well, you got to keep rolling for the DVD, you know?  Totally.  Get some extras in there.  Some extras.  And now there she is, smiling on camera.  She's got that fresh, fucked look.  Can she call a program so we can talk to them now?  Yeah.  If you're listening, call the show.  Totally pretty chick.  Yeah, call the show so we can talk to you guys.  See what you're all about.  Yeah.  Call up.  Call the show, and we would love to talk to you.  That was a nice surprise.  All right. 
[00:11:00]  Nice.  Now we have to regroup.  Tony in Queens, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, ONA.  How you doing?  Hey, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Jimmy, I was at your show on Saturday.  You killed Jimmy.  I was at the 8 o'clock show, me and my girl.  Unbelievable show, Jim.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, Jimmy played Albany all weekend long.  That went well, Jimmy?  Yeah, it was cool, man.  It's a shitty, boring town, but I mean, you know, the gigs were good.  There's nothing to do.  That's awful.  We went to a strip club, and that was all we did.  I was there with that little Corvette group that was very shocked at your humor.  It was a bunch of 60-year-old people that were part of a Corvette group. 
[00:11:30]  They all drove Corvettes.  And what, they just stumbled into the show, had no idea what they were going to see?  Yeah, slob they were about to watch.  So, you know, it was good.  Did they walk out?  No, no, they stayed.  It was like 10 of them.  Were they really annoyed?  Slightly through a lot of it, yeah.  Through the Monster Rain shit.  And a lot of it, they just didn't want to hear a lot of it.  The Monster Rain stuff is, you know, some cute stuff, though.  Yeah.  Well, they didn't find it adorable.  All right.  Thank you, Tony.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  I'm sorry, but the Map of Hawaii couple really fucked us up as far as our rhythm and energy go.  So, we'll get it together here now. 
[00:12:00]  Brian in Brooklyn, what's up?  Why the fuck did I leave for work early today?  I was on Paltorp last night, and Map of Hawaii had boobs out all night.  I won a little pre-show, and I missed the whole sex, the whole action.  Well, don't they, like, tape all these now, and it'll be shown later or something, Ant?  I have no idea what they do.  There's a whole underground network going.  You know.  I think that.  You know.  I think someone might do some caps.  Somebody had to capture that.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, though.  They banged yesterday, though.  Their schedule's really weird.  It was, like, yesterday in the afternoon. 
[00:12:30]  I just turned it on.  It was, like, four in the afternoon, and they're fucking.  It's all they do.  That's all they do?  That's all they should do.  Look at her.  Don't they have to go to work or anything?  They got to call the show.  That apartment actually looks kind of nice.  It's nice, right?  The view?  Yeah, it's a good view and whatnot.  Yeah, where are they from?  Floor-to-ceiling windows.  Independently wealthy couple, I guess.  Greg in DC, what's up?  Yeah.  Yeah, is this the beginning of a new bit called Moaning on Mondays?  We've already got to whip them out Wednesdays.  Yeah, you need that radio catch thing where you have to have an M-word and then Monday,  a T-word, and Tuesdays. 
[00:13:00]  Exactly.  A lot of alliteration.  Yes.  Exactly.  The problem is our list.  Makes it that much better.  Fucking on Friday.  Well, your listeners don't know what the word alliteration means, so you might need to  explain that one, too.  Our listeners are very competitive, too, so they're going to try to outdo each other.  Let me tell you something, I respect their listeners a lot more after watching that display.  Yeah.  They may not know what alliteration means, but they sure know how to move that camera  around.  All right, let's go to Eric in Bethlehem.  All right.  Oh, hey there.  I was at the Javits Center this weekend, and I saw Big Kev, and let me tell you, he was 
[00:13:30]  just a great guy.  He really represents the program well.  Oh, look at that.  Sweetheart.  He was totally cool, and also, got to mention, Kevin Smith saw you there this weekend.  Also, fantastic.  I didn't represent the program well at all.  No.  No, you could have done a little bit better.  I really should have.  That's okay.  You could have fucked on a table or something.  I had a table, too, and why didn't I think to use it like that?  Yeah, come on.  That was the comic book convention, right?  I purchased some things from the Viewers Cube booth. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I appreciate that, sir.  Send my kid to college one day.  You guys are great.  The program rules, and let's keep spreading the virus.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  How interactive are you guys with the message boards and everything these days?  I know at one point you were pretty deep in.  Yeah, I'm pretty.  I'm always there.  Still?  I get on once a day and answer questions.  Yeah.  I pop over to the website and check it out, and you're pretty attentive.  I do.  I'm like this dude.  I ate him out for a while before I ask him to fuck.  Give him the good fucking. 
[00:14:30]  Before I get it.  Well, I don't know if the fucking's any good, but I give him the fucking.  That's it.  But yeah, I spend a lot of time on the web.  You know, without those cats, I ain't got a job.  Yeah, exactly.  Don't have fans like this, though, sir.  No?  No.  Not that appreciative.  They're all different types.  But we do the same thing here.  Like, I'm on the message board.  You guys fuck on a table?  Yeah.  Fuckin' on the table for the listeners.  You gotta give.  Awesome.  You gotta give a little bit.  Eat a little ass, go right into the fucking.  You gotta be willing to eat a little ass.  Totally.  But yeah, I'm on there a lot and stuff. 
[00:15:00]  And you find that it does kind of, it makes a difference.  You only think you're hitting a few people here and there, but it really does make a difference.  Word gets out that you actually spend time there.  And the upshot to that is that, you know, a bunch of people come.  The downside is that a bunch of assholes can come as well.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, how do you take that?  You know, for years, I used to just take it.  We used to have people jump on and be like, you suck.  You suck cock and spell cock we're on.  Take a lot of shit.  And then one day we decided to institute a message fee to join the message board. 
[00:15:30]  Two bucks and it goes to charity.  It goes to RAIN, the rape and incest charity.  And you would be surprised it cut down 98% of the bullshit.  People, when forced with the idea of paying $2 to call you an asshole, they're like, it's not worth it.  $2, right.  They're like, it's not worth it.  And the ones that will pay the two bucks that really want to call you an asshole, they'll pay.  And then they get on there and they say their piece.  And then you delete their piece and keep their $2 and throw them on the website.  Because it's not like that $2 joins you for life.  It just joins you for as long as you're good.  Sometimes you do have to wield an iron fist. 
[00:16:00]  You have to.  And some people are like, oh, you should take it.  Don't be a pussy.  And it's like, life's too short to take that.  Dude, this is censorship, man.  And, you know, we should have the right to.  No, it's our message board.  Exactly.  Or it's this guy's message board that owns it.  And it's his right to put up or take off whatever the fuck he wants.  No such thing as free speech there.  Exactly.  No, not on a message board.  And why, like on a fan site, should you have to take that kind of abuse?  Why?  Who?  I mean.  It shouldn't be an ass kiss site. 
[00:16:30]  And that's what it, hopefully, remains for the rest of my life.  But why on earth, like if you don't like something, do you ever go seek it out and be like, I don't  like you?  Don't you just ignore it?  No.  If somebody, like, if someone, like, beat up my mother.  Right.  And made a website about it.  Right.  I'd probably write in and be like, you're a fucking asshole.  Or be like, I disagree with this website.  Yeah, I completely don't like this.  But aside from making something like that, I could give a shit.  Exactly.  Yeah.  But there are people there, you know, these fucking guys, man. 
[00:17:00]  They talk about this too much, or they do this, or prima donnas complain about the equipment  not working.  We have some, uh, we have fan sites that don't have any fans on them anymore.  No.  It's just complete fashion.  And then they get pissed off that we don't promote them on the show.  I'm like, why would we promote you guys?  You're not fans anymore.  It's obvious.  We know who our fans are.  Yeah.  If you go to a message board that's supposedly an Opie and Anthony fan site, and over 75  to 80% of all postings are negative, how is that a fan site? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  And why should we promote it?  You guys just can't take criticism.  Oh, angry typing guy.  That was kind of like irritated typing guy.  That was irritated typing guy.  Only Opie does angry typing guy.  Anytime he talks about it.  Yeah, we understand it shouldn't be a kiss-ass thing, like you said, but-  No, it shouldn't.  It really should be a kiss-ass thing.  You think it should just be a kiss-ass?  Why not?  Can't there be one place in the world where you go and get props for what you do and people  are happy with you and whatnot that's filtered out all the assholes?  All the assholes.  I think there should be. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  It's rough, though, sometimes.  I like the idea of being able to turn someone around.  Right.  I've done that in the past.  It's kind of like a mission.  I used to enjoy that, because I've been doing this.  I've had a message board now.  We started in 96 or what?  10 years now.  I used to enjoy trying to turn people around.  Not anymore.  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, if you don't like it, you don't like it.  You know, I can't spend all my time, waste all my time trying to fucking convert one  person, because I've done that so many times.  And the wife would just be like, I can't believe you spend all your time trying to convert 
[00:18:30]  fucking Wampa One instead of coming in here and knocking me.  And I'm like, yeah, why am I doing that?  I'll never meet this guy.  I'm not going to fuck this dude on a table.  I'm not going to convert this dude.  I used to do that as well.  But now I just write him back and just write, oh, well.  Yeah, that's my, my philosophy now is just like, do you feel better?  I hate you fucking, and I just reply, oh, well.  That's why.  And that burns, too.  They'll hate that.  Because they're like, I wrote all that.  You wrote two fucking words.  This is why I don't like you.  That's why that scene was so cool when you guys just went to the houses and just started 
[00:19:00]  beating the shit.  And they're all like 12-year-old kids.  And you're punching them in the face.  The people that don't like our stuff on the internet really cite that movie as being childish.  Yeah.  Which is, I think, ironic.  Yeah, a bit.  They don't like that scene particularly.  Hey, we got to break into this conversation and talk to Katie from Pal Talk.  All right.  She just got laid.  Katie.  Yes.  Very, very nice.  Thank you.  Well done.  Thanks.  A big star got to see you guys have sex. 
[00:19:30]  I know.  We didn't know Kevin Smith was going to be here.  Hardly a big star.  I was a big star while you were fucking.  Very big in my pants.  Very nice.  That was tremendous.  So you guys woke up early, set an alarm to do that?  Yeah, well, we got to go to work.  Yeah.  But it was definitely scheduled.  So what do you guys do?  I mean, if you're not comfortable saying, although you just fucked on the internet, so I can't see how you wouldn't be comfortable saying what you do for a living.  I'm a financial advisor.  Invest in Pal Talk. 
[00:20:00]  He's used to fucking people.  Exactly.  On a regular basis.  And what do you do, ma'am?  I work in a doctor's office right now.  Tremendous.  That is great.  And it looks like you guys are doing pretty well.  What state are you from?  We're out on Long Island.  You're on Long Island?  Strong Island, as we saw this morning.  Wow.  Damn.  But you have a telescope.  That's kind of nice.  Nice place for Long Island.  I thought the telescopes are for Manhattan, I thought.  Eh, Long Island.  No, we're way out east.  We're right on the Sound, so we look over at Connecticut with it.  Yeah.  That telescope was an award they got for fucking on the internet. 
[00:20:30]  It was the first prize in an internet fucking contest.  Yeah, there were people in Connecticut looking at you.  They're actually using the telescope to look at stars.  Can I ask what made you want to do it?  I guess there's a bit of an exhibitionist streak running through both of y'all.  You know what?  We actually got our camera yesterday.  We signed up for Paltec Talk, since you guys were talking about it so much on the show,  and just got hooked immediately.  Yeah, immediately.  Now, is there any fear of repercussion, like family seeing this or something like that? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  It's kind of hot.  Oh, so it's the danger that makes it interesting.  Yeah.  Good to know.  I don't think anyone in my family would be on here, so.  Nah.  Where do they live?  Close.  Close.  They don't have XM?  No.  No, I don't.  I want to get it, though.  I will.  If I was banging her, the first thing I'd want to do is get a camera and show everybody.  She's fucking solid.  Yeah, she's very attractive.  She's more than solid, sir. 
[00:21:30]  She's a solid is what?  A six, seven?  No, no.  For me, a solid is more of a nine area.  Really?  No, no.  Not for my own life.  Just a gem.  Two and a half is fine.  Right.  When observing on film.  How long have you guys been dating?  Are you married?  No, we've been dating for about a year and a half.  A year and a half.  Yeah.  I guess the dream is to have some ex-girlfriend or boyfriend cruising around pal talk and  be like, oh my God.  Yes, I know.  That's what I mean.  I'd let her go.  Oh, the boyfriend.  An ex-boyfriend's just going, hey, you know, I heard about this pal talk. 
[00:22:00]  Let me...  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  The ex-girlfriend is just like, I can't believe he ate her pussy.  Yeah, that's pretty nice of you there, dude.  Giving a little bit beforehand.  That's smart.  That's called marketing, sir.  Yeah.  Just in case things don't work out, be like, you may have seen me on pal talk eating my  ex-girlfriend out.  You've got to give her a little something on the front end.  They just got the camera, what, yesterday you already had sex two or three times?  We got it two days ago. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, we've had sex like three times.  Because, Jimmy, you saw them having sex last night, too, right?  It was yesterday sometime, yeah.  It was lovely.  Did you jack off to it?  No, it was...  But then I was like, you know what?  Let's just do it.  Got a little excited.  No, I didn't bang because I still don't have shades, so I'm in that open, like, fishbowl  room, so I just have to kind of squeeze my mule through my sweats under my desk.  You are despicable.  People can look in from all these windows and see me.  Do you think there's a point where it's not going to be enough that you have to take it  to the next level, a.k.a. anal? 
[00:23:00]  Oh, he's been trying.  No doubt, man.  Who hasn't?  If there's blood in his veins, he's trying.  How old are you, wacky kids?  I'm 22.  I'm 25.  Right on.  Where'd you guys meet?  In a spa.  Yeah.  Which does?  I worked in a salon, and he came in.  We went to the same school, though.  Just graduated different years.  Want to plug that school?  Because I'm sure they'd be proud to see two of their alma mater out there really making 
[00:23:30]  it in the world.  I think you'd like to see this clip on classmates.com, baby.  Then and now.  Did you guys know each other when you were in high school, or you were a few years apart?  Yeah, we didn't know each other through high school.  But he would be, what, a senior when you were a freshman?  Yeah.  Right on.  And you had no idea that one day you'd be fucking this upperclassman on the internet.  Life takes weird turns, doesn't it?  These guys are the stars of PalTalk, though.  They've only had a camera a couple days, and everyone knows who they are now.  There's going to be a little jealousy on PalTalk, though. 
[00:24:00]  That's what I'm thinking.  There's going to be some jealousy and some people shit-talking, because, you know.  There was guys talking shit yesterday.  It's like, what are you doing?  They just banged for you.  It's a matter of you.  How could they possibly?  Who would criticize that?  Who's complaining?  I mean, I can see, like, the conservative side, the moral majority criticizing.  But if you're on PalTalk, and if that bugs you, you wouldn't be looking at it in the first place.  Who would possibly criticize that?  There's a section on PalTalk for talk, liberal, conservative.  There's, like, talk where you could sit there and talk about the issues and everything. 
[00:24:30]  And then there's adult section with the video like this.  People fucking.  The only criticism I would have is, why have they only fucked three times in two days?  This needs to be happening all the time.  We're trying.  Got to earn some money, I guess.  Go to work.  Is it a long commute?  Yeah.  Where do you work?  Manhattan?  No.  No, I work on Long Island.  Ah.  There's no way they would make it.  Actually, not too far from F.H. Riley's.  We're going to go next week.  Yeah, we'll be there.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:25:00]  You just gave the best plug.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Opie's Brothers Restaurant, F.H. Riley's.  You guys are going to be there what day?  We're going to go on Saturday for the karaoke thing.  But listen, since there's so many weird guys on the internet looking at my girlfriend naked,  could you guys bring Master Poe to protect her?  We're going to have Master Poe there, Club Soda Kenny.  It's going to be a great night.  You'll have all kinds of protection, believe me.  We're talking about late night karaoke at F.H. Riley's this coming Saturday night.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington, yes.  Sir, I guarantee you nobody will hassle her because I'll be standing right behind her whacking 
[00:25:30]  my bag.  That's fine.  Well, that's wonderful.  And, sir, don't discount the amount of guys who will be eyeballing you as well now that  they've seen your gear.  It's so true.  The guy's packing.  I turned it on.  I'm like, who's putting a leg in that girl's vagina?  Oh, it's a stick.  Isn't that the weird thing?  Like, we all watched them fuck, and we watched it.  Once he pulled out his cock, nobody said, hey, that's a really good-sized cock because  nobody wants to say that's a good-sized cock in case somebody in the room goes, that 
[00:26:00]  cock's small.  You know?  Yeah.  Nobody wants to admit that, like, wow, that cock made me a little-  Poor son of a bitch.  You're just afraid that your voice will crack while you're saying it or it'll come out wrong.  That's quite a cock.  That cock looks delicious.  That's so funny.  Yeah.  Well, thanks again.  We'll look forward to seeing you on Pal Talk and Saturday night at FH Riley's.  Wow.  We'll be there.  God bless your union, kids.  Keep on doing it.  Yes.  Thank you, guys.  All right. 
[00:26:30]  There they go.  Bye.  The stars of the show already.  We've talked about it in the past how someone must have approached the patent office, software  company, the first idea of video conferencing, and just been, this is great.  You know how Bob has to go over to Japan every couple of weeks and meet with the Wasaki people?  We can now do it online.  Right.  And the very next thing was, and people can fuck.  You know damn well the pitch was all business.  But then when we come down to the reality- 
[00:27:00]  market was like, could you imagine watching Bob fuck his wife real time in Japan before the  meeting?  All right.  The phones.  Wow.  Wow.  Let's see.  Let's start with this over here.  Mr. Motherfucker from Whackbag.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I just wanted to ask Kevin about what Brian Johnson is up to these days.  Brian Johnson, a friend of mine, a guy that made this movie called Vulgar.  I saw Vulgar.  Oh, yeah.  I saw Vulgar.  Brian has been in Jersey for the last, I guess it's coming up on five months. 
[00:27:30]  I'm going to see him tonight, actually.  And he's going to be coming west again.  He was living in Los Angeles for a while.  He's been writing the next flick he wants to do.  Yeah.  I just want to thank him for, I was at Wizard World in Chicago, and he took part in something  that I shot where I tried to get a few celebrities to wish Jim Norton a happy.  Happy birthday.  Right on.  Oh, thank you.  And that was pretty cool, so.  He's a good guy.  He's a tremendous dude.  Funny guy.  One of the funniest people I've ever known in my life. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, yeah.  Anyway, I'm punching out.  All right.  Thanks, man.  I did see some of that footage, too, by the way.  Thank you.  Punching out who?  No, just punching out.  Oh, I see.  That's in, he has nothing else to offer.  That's it.  And he wants to get out before he crashes.  Yeah.  That was a good move, man.  That was smart.  A lot of people don't do that, though.  They just hang on there and be like, so.  They hang out.  Their jet goes right in, and then they go, I'm punching out.  And it's like, no, you're flaming fuel and metal.  Yeah, it's done.  I like to punch out.  Some people, they try to be humorous on the show, and they stop, and they go, but punch 
[00:28:30]  it out.  Right.  And that's legit.  He reached between the legs, pulled it.  The canopy went.  He flew out.  He's fine.  Right.  His joke, you know, into the ditch.  But some people don't know when to punch out.  I think you unload, and you get out quick.  Yeah.  Hey, going back to the Vulgar movie.  How did you get that in Blockbuster?  You know, they did two cuts of that movie.  One that we did theatrically.  I saw the clean cut, then?  You saw the clean cut.  No way.  If you got it from Blockbuster, we had to do an R-rated cut, because they don't carry  on NC-17 movies, yeah.  Are you kidding?  That movie was deeply disturbing.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  They cut some stuff out.  I could not believe I got it in Blockbuster to begin with, but you're telling me there's  a dirtier version out there.  Yeah.  The clown rape scene goes on a little bit longer.  That's what I thought it should have.  You're sitting there going, this movie would be all right if they just push the edge of the  envelope.  That could absolutely go longer.  Very twisted.  Yeah.  Why did you decide to make Vulgar?  Brian wrote the script, and he directed it.  All I had to do was throw some money behind it.  Right, right, right.  I just thought it was funny.  Well, that's what I mean.  Why did you get behind it?  The script, to me, who can't get behind clown rape, sir? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Especially male-on-male clown rape.  You see so many rape movies that it's just the standard with a guy and a girl, but why  not switch it up and go the other way?  Equal time.  And the script, to me, just played like Brian Johnson on a page.  It was just my friend kind of splayed out there on a page, and every line just reeked  of him and made me laugh, so I was like, oh, I can get behind this.  Plus, it felt like a real 70s exploitation kind of flick.  Totally.  Totally loved it. 
[00:30:00]  What do you think of Jason Lee with My Name is Earl?  My name is Earl.  Thank God the rest of the world seems to have caught on to Lee.  It's great.  Does he call you and thank you?  I mean, he's always been very incredibly gracious.  Yeah.  But it was nice when, right before the show debuted, there were billboards for that show.  It was all over.  The hype was huge for us.  In Los Angeles, I really couldn't drive five blocks of that, seeing Jason Lee's face all  huge, and that just did me proud.  Yeah.  It made me feel like a smart guy.  I was like, I cast that dude.  I think he's fantastic, and I was a little scared when I saw all this hype, thinking, 
[00:30:30]  oh, shit.  It can't live up to it.  It can't live up to it.  No, it did.  He is too goddamn funny.  He is so charming.  The show rests solely on his shoulders, and he's very charming at its epicenter, so it  kind of works.  Ethan's funny, too.  Ethan's a play.  He plays his brother.  And just the thought that he has to walk around with that mustache and that hair all the time  really cracks me up.  He came in and did a day for us on Clerks, too, and he showed up in his mustache, and I  was like, well, dude, we're going to have to shave that mustache. 
[00:31:00]  He's like, I can't do it, dude.  This is the money.  I was like, I'm kidding, sir.  I'm kidding.  It's like Burt Reynolds' mustache back in the 70s.  Totally.  He finally has his Reynolds' mustache.  It's gotten like that mustache has become so identifiable that those articles would  be like, who should be cast in this movie?  They were talking about doing a Magnum P.I. movie.  They're like, top choice should be Jason Lee.  Why?  He's got the mustache.  The mustache, man.  He's got the Magnum P.I.  Never mind whether or not he's good for the role.  He just has little facial hair, and that'll do it.  What about Clerks 2?  Clerks 2, August 18th, comes out.  August 18th? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Happy with it?  Love it.  Yeah.  I think it's really, really funny.  Yeah.  I saw the trailer.  Not much info in the trailer.  Yeah.  Teaser.  A lot of movement.  Teaser.  Yeah.  Teaser.  Teaser.  Just to give you a general flavor of what it looks like.  And it's great to see everybody again.  Yeah.  I'm definitely looking forward to it.  I love it, sir.  I'm not going to oversell it.  I just, I love it.  I think it's funny, and it's really raunchy.  It pushes the edge of the envelope very, very far.  I don't think we're going to get a rating, because we know we can't get an R, so rather  than go out on the NC-17, we're just going to go out unrated.  Unrated.  Yeah, because ironically, you get an NC-17, nobody gets into your movie, you know, under 
[00:32:00]  17.  But if you're unrated, a five-year-old could buy a ticket.  What are the restrictions to, like, unrated?  There are no restrictions.  Unrated means you haven't gone through the NBA.  Yeah, why wouldn't everyone do that, then?  Because most studios are signatories of the Motion Picture Association of America, so they  have to get a rating.  So most of your independents aren't, you know?  And that's why films that come out, like The Aristocrats, was independently distributed,  and so they had no rating whatsoever.  So the risk you run is there are some chains out there, some theater chains, that are like,  well, we won't take an unrated flick.  But we weren't looking for, you know, 3,000 screens anyway. 
[00:32:30]  I'd be happy with 1,000 screens.  I know there are 1,000 screens out there, wouldn't mind programming our flick.  What kind of goods are in there that might catch an NC-17?  Again, it's not even like, it's certainly nothing like the couple on Pal Talk.  You know, there's nothing visually titillating.  It's just all the stuff they talk about.  Yeah.  Conversation-wise dialogue.  It's conversation.  That's the weird thing in this country, is you can get away with showing people get  blown away and chopped up in an R-rated movie.  Yeah, we talk about that all the time.  The moment you start talking about sex, they get really antsy, give you an NC-17. 
[00:33:00]  How many people are in the MPAA?  How many, what is that?  There's a great documentary that just screened at Sundance, and it's going to be on, I think  it's on IFC.  Yeah, it's going to be on IFC this year, and it's called This Film Is Not Yet Rated, made by  this guy named Kirby Dick, and it's about the ratings process and how it works.  And it's shrouded in secrecy.  You don't know who's on the MPAA.  You don't know who's screening or rating your film.  And Kirby spends the whole movie trying to track down and identify the people that are 
[00:33:30]  actually on the MPAA.  And he hires two detectives to follow them.  And really, by the end of the film, it does identify them.  I mean, hopefully I'm not spoiling it.  And then the rest of the film is made up of interviews of filmmakers who've gotten an  NC-17 for ridiculous shit.  Yeah, most people have no clue.  I don't know how.  That's the thing.  I've been through that process so many times, getting a film rated six times.  Twice I've had ratings that I've actually had to go in there.  Three times that I've had to go in there and fight.  Twice I actually went in and fight.  On Clerks, they gave us an NC-17, and we went through the appeals process, and we got that 
[00:34:00]  overturned to an R without cutting the flick.  That was pretty much dialogue, right?  That was all dialogue.  Jersey Girl, which is a film that is so fucking tepid.  You know, there's nothing in that film that's, by any stretch of the imagination, like R-rated  territory.  And they gave us an R based on a conversation that Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler have in a  diner about masturbation.  And I was just like, are you insane?  Like, we don't even use, you know, colorful euphemisms for it.  Like, you know, bopping the bishop or something, even some lame shit like that. 
[00:34:30]  It was all clinical terms.  Yeah.  And still, one of the raiders that were, I think her name was Joan, when I spoke to her  afterwards, she goes, look, I would not be comfortable with my 16-year-old daughter sitting  there listening to Liv Tyler talk about masturbation.  I'm like, your 16-year-old daughter is rocking the showerhead, I assure you, every morning.  Don't worry.  She can hear this because she does far, far worse, finger banging.  I love when they pull their personal little attention into the job.  But that's the thing in the doc, which is amazing, is that when they identify these people, they 
[00:35:00]  tell you the age of their children.  Because the MPA is supposed to be made up of parents.  It's parents, you know, looking at a film and rating it for other parents.  And the average age of the child that these people have, 22, 25.  I mean, you know, like, these people have kids, technically, but kids who are long since  passed, you know, the stage where the parent has to worry about, like, is it okay for them  to see Dave Chappelle's block party?  You know, it's just, it's a silly, really silly process.  And one that's not governed by anybody. 
[00:35:30]  It's not like beholden to the FCC or something like that.  You know, it's just-  Who pays them?  They're paid.  It's a government body, but they're not voted into office.  They're all just pretty much handpicked and hired for a long time by, like, this  They tell you who picks them and everything.  It was a student for ages, this dude Jack Valenti, since the MPA was started, was this  old dude who had, like, government ties and whatnot.  I mean, he was handpicked by, I think it was, if I remember the doc correctly, Nixon? 
[00:36:00]  Pre-Nixon?  I forget.  Wow.  So, great documentary.  This film is not it-rated, it's called.  Why is it a secret who they are, though?  Why do they want to be identified?  This is what the whole documentary is about.  Like, why is it a secret?  Their philosophy at the MPA is, like, they have to keep the identities on the down low  because they would get lobbied by people to, you know, rate their film differently.  But, eh, it's just kind of horseshit.  Based on that, you wouldn't know who any government official was because they could be lobbied.  You know, it just makes very little sense.  Let's go to Mark in Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:36:30]  Kevin Smith.  I think you're great.  I love clerks.  Thank you, sir.  Real quick, how come you picked the shithole town of Paulsboro, New Jersey, to film Jersey  girl?  It was very close to Philadelphia.  It was about 15 minutes from Philadelphia, and that's where we were based with the crew  and whatnot because you have to kind of shoot in areas where you can pull from a crew base.  In Philly, there's a big crew base.  Shooting in Philly is cheaper than shooting in New York and shooting in Jersey because  where we live in Jersey is about 75 miles away from what's considered the zone.  The center of Manhattan goes out about 60 to 70 miles. 
[00:37:00]  And once you go beyond that, you have to pay people more because they have to travel further  to get to where you're shooting.  And so by shooting in Philly, we can stay within a zone.  And then Paulsboro was only like 15 minutes down the road.  So that was still well within the zone.  And it kind of doubled pretty well for the town of Highlands, which is like two hours  south of there or north of there, north of there.  Did you have any issues with Clerks 2, where you shot it because of so much time going by?  Was there any? 
[00:37:30]  No, I mean, so much of the Clerks 2 is set in a burger joint called Mubi's.  So we didn't have to worry about shooting in Leonardo in New Jersey where the quick stop is.  We went back there for like a week at the end of the show and shot there.  But most of it was shot in this town in Los Angeles, Buena Park.  So it didn't really have enough time had no effect on it.  I mean, the great thing about what the movie has going for it in its back pocket is time is on its side.  Like both Brian and Jeff look older. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  And there's something kind of poignant about that, you know, something even more sad about these dudes still working at these shitty jobs.  I saw some, I went to a website and saw some pictures of the location then and now.  And it's so odd, like to see a little twig of a tree growing on the side of it.  And it's just this huge, massive tree now.  The weird thing is when people see it in color for the first time, they're like, I don't agree with the color choice.  Right.  Of the building.  It's like it's always been that color. 
[00:38:30]  Are people just stopping by that location all the time?  Yeah.  They said that they get people at literally every day.  Jerry's a legend, man.  They buy Gatorade and smokes and then they ask to take a picture behind the counter.  Oh, that's so cool.  And they hate it.  The toppers who own the store are just like, oh, it's too disruptive.  People come in here all the time.  Screw that.  Why wouldn't you?  Just charge five bucks to do it or something.  Totally.  That's what I said.  You got to sell them t-shirts.  You got to start charging people to take a picture behind the desk.  I mean, make the most of it.  But they're very, it's every time we go there to shoot. 
[00:39:00]  Like, we went there to shoot this.  They refused to shut down for us to shoot.  So basically, we're shooting while the store's open.  So you go inside.  You're rolling on a take.  You say cut.  They open the door.  People come in, buy cigarettes and milk while you're getting ready for the next take.  Yeah.  Then you wait for everyone to leave and then you roll again.  You think they would throw you a bow?  Oh, my God.  I know.  Because it's not like we're doing it for fear.  You have to throw them a location for you as well.  But still, their philosophy is we cannot shut the store down.  Because what if people come here to buy milk and we're locked up because you're shooting 
[00:39:30]  your movie and then they go to Crousers and buy milk instead.  Right.  So they don't want to.  I mean, good for them because they're loyal to the customer base.  But it is kind of strange.  Come on.  If you give us an hour of closed store, we'll be done and out of your hair.  But that hour becomes four because you have to wait for somebody to come in, buy a pack  of Skittles and leave.  That's really cool.  Do you think maybe they like the idea, though, of people coming in and seeing you guys film  there, too?  Maybe it's a way to kind of show off that they're having a movie made there?  I don't think it has nothing to do with that because if they could, they would erase 
[00:40:00]  the memory of the movie from people's minds because they feel it disrupts business all  the time.  When people come in to take a picture of the store while they're working, it's just like  that's holding up this dude behind them from buying a paper.  So, I mean, they're very nice people and they're kind to everyone that comes in, but  they secretly can't stand when people come in and say, like, this place is so much bigger  than it looks in the movie.  They're like, we can tell the people when they walk through the door, we can tell them  right away that they're fans because their eyes are wide and they're staring at everything  in the store.  It's like I could understand about the disruption thing if, you know, you did the movie in a 
[00:40:30]  hospital.  It's like, God, you're a fucking convenience store.  Totally.  Lighten up.  I think maybe at the end of the day, it's just like too much traffic.  They like their downtime.  Yeah.  They like to, you know, the morning rush and then the post-school rush, but like, they like  that downtime.  They can sit around and watch TV and stuff, but now they got people come in all the time.  Dogma.  We talked about it over the phone for a little while last time we spoke.  You had a lot of issues with that, with the Catholic League.  You know, no.  Such a great organization.  Donahue.  We've had our problems with him, too. 
[00:41:00]  Did he got on you?  Oh, that's right.  The Catholic Church, the St. Pat's thing.  Yeah, that dude's a tool.  That dude has nothing to do with the Catholic Church whatsoever.  Nothing.  None.  He's self-appointed.  He created his own organization.  He loves the attention.  Oh, like you read about.  Yeah.  And then he makes grist for the mill out of it.  And then at the end of the day, like, because he took us to task for Dogma and raked us over  the coals and whatnot, and then some Entertainment Weekly reporter who had spoken to him passed  on to me, like, once the Dogma thing died down, she said, Bill Donahue, he said he would  love to take you out and buy you a beer. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  And I was just like, first off, I don't drink.  Second off, like, this dude made my life hell for months.  Yeah.  And what's the Catholic dude doing drinking?  You know, like, I'm bad.  I'm going to hell because I made this movie and this dude wants to booze it up.  Yeah.  Would you ever take on something like that that you know would give you some shit in  your life at this point in your life?  It'd be tough.  When you're full of piss and vinegar as a kid, it's like, you know, yeah, I'm going to fight  a man.  It would be tough at this point because I've thought about doing a follow-up to Dogma, 
[00:42:00]  not necessarily Dogma 2, but something in the same vein.  Particularly after September 11th, like, religion became a big topic of discussion.  I mean, you know, September 11th is religiously motivated.  Our president admits to being a born-again Christian.  You know, creepy religious things going on where I was just like, wow, I do have a  lot more to say about religion.  But now I'm married and I got a kid.  And the thing is, if you're going to talk about religion, you have to talk about Islam  at this point.  Yep.  And the moment you talk about Islam, you know, you've got to worry about fucking getting  killed.  Yep. 
[00:42:30]  And when I was single and by myself and I was irresponsible, who gives a shit?  I got my friends.  We'll kick their ass.  Totally.  It's just like Brian Johnson, Walt Flangman at Hefstack, we'll take them all on.  We'll kick their ass.  Take on the entire fucking community.  And now you've got to think of a wife and kid.  I got a wife and kid and that's the thing.  It becomes, and people will be like, oh, you pussy.  It's like, all right, all right, you go do it.  You know, take my place.  Never understand that.  At least you're honest, though, about being, because they are, to me, Islam is scary and  they murder you for speech issues.  Right.  And nobody wants to talk about that.  Everybody's like, well, you know, you can't be judgmental.  I mean, they're peaceful. 
[00:43:00]  They're not peaceful.  Well, that's not Kevin saying that.  That's me saying they're not peaceful people.  Yeah, no.  It's not about like, I'm being kind to people and letting them have their say.  It's just like, if you, I mean, look at what's going on with the Danish folks who drew  the cartoons in the newspaper.  It's like, that's, that is some frightening shit.  How about Van Gogh, who did an unpopular film about Islam?  So the guy stabs him, shoots him and sits on his chest and waits for the cops.  They're sociopaths.  But it's not violent.  No, I'm back and forth with an email thing with a guy who's not a bad guy, but he's  like, you're a Muslim hater and I got to deal with that shit.  And it's like, no, I'm not.  Kind of. 
[00:43:30]  Three keys on the keyboard.  The Y, the E and the yes.  Jimmy.  Same.  And that's the thing.  It's like, they'll make it like about hating Muslims.  And it's not about hating Muslims.  It's about hating any extremist.  Anybody.  A Catholic, a Christian extremist, anybody who takes it too fucking far.  Well, when Christians all over the world are fucking rioting and setting fires because  it's something Marmaduke did, they don't love them all into the same category.  But right now, Islam, this one is on you.  Don't you remember the great Garfield uprising?  Yeah.  People were like, he likes lasagna far too much. 
[00:44:00]  And somehow this besmirches Christ.  All right.  Well, let's go to the phones.  A lot of people want to talk to Kevin Smith this morning.  Heather, what's up?  Hey, Kevin Smith.  How are you?  Hey, how are you?  Good.  I wanted to tell you I love clerks.  Thank you.  Ironically, I moved to Jersey.  I moved to Middletown about five years ago.  So I've been to the Quickie Mart.  But I wanted to know if the food circus clown made it into the second clerks because I saw 
[00:44:30]  you taping there.  We did.  Food circus clown is totally in the opening like five minutes of the movie.  There's this big, there used to be a food store in Middletown, New Jersey that, you  know, back in the days they would do that huge pop art and they had this scary looking  fucking clown.  You know, it's about 30 feet high and about 10, 15 feet wide that hung out in front of  this food store, food circus it was called.  And it would rotate.  And then eventually the town got us to stop rotating because it was too distracting because  it's on a main highway. 
[00:45:00]  Then the place sold, closed down, the food circus closed down and became a liquor world  instead.  So now he's like the liquor clown with these red eyes and whatnot.  And he's got an oddly placed hand there.  There used to be a secondary piece of art that came out, him holding a balloon, but the  balloon's gone.  It looks like he's holding his cock.  So it's this thing, this, this, this, this, uh, total, like wonderful eyesore that sits  on the highway in Middletown that people have been trying to get taken down for years and  a bunch of people, the rest of us have supported it because it's such a great, like piece of  pop culture that you don't see anymore. 
[00:45:30]  They don't really do big art.  Now it's all billboards whoring something, right?  Some corporate shit.  But this is this great piece of fucking like, uh, bizarre advertising art that you just  don't really see anymore.  Like, like the giant Alfred E. Newmans that sit in front of like great adventure and shit  like that.  So, uh, we've, we've been trying to put that in a movie for so many years and finally got  it into, into clerks too.  We were shot and that's what she was asking about.  All right.  Let's, uh, say hi to Vince in Chicago.  Hey, Vince.  Hey, good morning, boys.  What's up?  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hello, Vince. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, good morning.  How are you?  Are you wearing your fubu today?  I'm not wearing fubu now.  I stopped wearing, I used to wear fubu shirts all the time.  And then I just went, I found a dude who can make me a close approximation of a fubu  shooter so I could put my own shit on it.  Cause I used to get really bad looks from some, from some black folks.  Why are you wearing fubu?  I'm like, cause it fits.  You know what the you means in that, sir?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Uh, hey, I saw clerks on, I don't know, cable over the weekend and it reminded me the last 
[00:46:30]  time you're on the show.  Did, did you say there's a, uh, there's an alternate ending to that?  Yeah.  If you check out the clerk's DVD, there's an alternate ending where Dante, uh, gets shot.  The guy who works in the convenience store gets shot and killed.  Yeah.  It's just an awful depressing ending for that movie.  Such a fun, good spirited, uh, movie.  And then there he is just laying there dead on the floor.  Totally not a good idea.  Horrible.  But the first idea I ever had about the script, I was just like, I want to make a movie about  working in convenience store and at the end of it, the guy gets killed.  And, uh, when I put the movie together, showed it to somebody, um, friend, my friend, John 
[00:47:00]  Pearson was just like, you got to cut that ending.  Yeah.  He's going to make sense.  You grow to love these characters over 90 minutes and then you kill the guy for no other  reason other than you don't know how to end the movie.  I was like, yeah, I guess you're right.  Let's go to Jeff in Canada.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Kevin, I was at your, uh, Q and A in Vancouver in the summer.  Oh, right on.  Yeah, that was awesome.  Now you went like all night.  Um, I think they basically shut the place down while you were still talking.  Yeah, that was about, I think we wind up going like six and a half hours at night. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  The DVDs are great, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Where, uh, Kevin goes around various colleges and locations and just takes Q and A and  they're funny and entertaining and informative.  I love doing Q and A.  It's obvious you like doing it.  Oh yeah.  Huh, Jeff?  You got a second volume of those coming out, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, Evening with Kevin Smith 2, Evening Harder comes out in August.  Oh yeah, it was pretty cool because when we left that night, we saw Jason Muir leaving  with two chicks.  That was pretty cool.  Yeah, he's, uh, the Jason Muir is just a fucking pussy magnet.  Yeah, I saw him at a party one night and he was just, you know, working the room. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, it's insane.  And now that he's sober, cause you know, he was just a fucking really bad junkie for  a while.  Yeah.  He was on heroin and Oxycon, but in April it'll be three years completely clean and sober for  him.  Now he just gets insanely more pussy.  Like, don't matter.  Like, Jason gets really bad cold sores and shit.  You know, I get cold sores too, but Jason will get cold sores like three at a time across  his lips look like fucking Rocky Balboa, like, you know, after a few rounds, like big nasty  ones, like unavoidable.  You can tell what they are.  It's not like, oh, he's got chapped lips.  You're like, there's a fucking cold sores. 
[00:48:30]  And the dude will still get fucked with those cold sores.  Jesus Christ.  One of those dudes doesn't even have to try.  Let's go to-  Is it easy?  You would assume it's easier to work with him these days.  It's sober.  Oh, much easier.  I mean the-  But I'm thinking the other way.  Maybe now he's a prima donna and you know.  No, not at all.  The truth was though, every time we've ever shot a movie, he's never really been  musing or drunk or anything like that.  As soon as we stopped shooting, left to his own devices, when he doesn't have something  to occupy all his time, that's what he would occupy his time with, fucking drugs. 
[00:49:00]  Now it's poker and fucking this Lord of the Rings online game that he plays.  I mean, you know, you drop one addiction, you've got to replace it with another.  And he's replaced it with fucking Lord of the Rings.  Which is how they ought to really market or advertise that game.  It's just like, if you're a junkie and you want to get clean, you know, storm the castles  of Mordor and shit like that.  Lord of the Rings.  No addiction.  Those games are just like Crack though.  Oh, yeah.  I was on EverQuest for years where-  EverCrack.  Where you were able to look and see how much real time you've actually played. 
[00:49:30]  Not how long you-  Cumulative.  Since you subscribed.  Yeah.  How long you've actually been playing the game.  And mine had reached over 365 days.  Could you imagine?  And it's like, there was a year of my life spent playing this fucking game, man.  It's amazing.  It's just this whole thing.  If you have anything of an addictive personality, those games are built for it.  Oh, totally.  It's like, I've got to get to the next level.  And then once you get there, it's like, I've got to get to the next level.  And is it a game with an ending or does it just keep going? 
[00:50:00]  No, it's open-ended.  They keep giving you expansion packs so it adds new material.  And then you've got to keep going.  And then you could peak out at like level 60 and then you do that and all of a sudden,  hey, we're opening up to 75 people.  Level 75.  Now you've got to be at level 75.  You're fucking pushing.  You're getting your ass off.  Level 60.  It just doesn't end.  That's tremendous.  Actually, what's his name?  His son was addicted to it.  Ben Stein?  Oh, Ben Stein.  That's right.  Ben Stein wrote a whole thing about how his son was addicted to EverQuest. 
[00:50:30]  Serious, man.  Took him to rehab.  Had to sit in there.  Woke up at two in the morning to find him crying.  On the computer as his father was dragging him off and stuff.  Just picturing this thing, could you please get off the computer?  I can't picture him being angry or anything.  But had to send him to rehab for video games.  Unbelievable.  Really sad.  Let's say hi to Mike in New Jersey.  How embarrassing to be in rehab.  What are you here for?  Video games.  EverQuest.  This guy with track marks on his arms. 
[00:51:00]  No septum left in his nose.  He's got carpal tunnel syndrome like you read about.  His hands are claws.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, Kevin.  What's up?  I'm a big fan.  Hey, good morning.  Thank you.  Hey, I was wondering how involved you are in the independent film festivals.  I know you've sponsored Freedom Film Festival and Red Bank.  And I was wondering if you're still involved in everything.  I didn't really, I mean, I don't want to take credit for that festival.  They asked me to throw some money behind it, and I think I bought some ads and threw them 
[00:51:30]  some cash or something.  But that was a festival of their own doing, those cats that put that together in Red Bank.  But I don't get that involved.  I mean, I'll be involved in a fest if I take a movie there or if I go there to be a judge  or something like that.  But I haven't, the only festival that I've sponsored, and it was more of an online festival,  was this Movies Askew contest we did last year where people could send in their flicks  and other people could vote on them and stuff like that.  But I'm just not talented enough to pull off a film festival myself. 
[00:52:00]  I mean, we've done these things called vulgar-thons where we'll, like, rent out, in Los Angeles  we rented out the Cinerama Dome for a day and showed, like, four or five of our movies  and stuff.  But that's kind of, that to me is a one-day event, and it's not as involved as a Sundance  or something like that, or even as that Freedom Fest in Red Bank.  Because it takes a lot to traffic a bunch of prints and find a bunch of movies to show  from various distributors.  If I want to show a bunch of stuff I've done or some friends of mine have done,  very easy.  You must get solicited a lot from people, like, hey, dude, I got a great idea. 
[00:52:30]  You got 60 grand I could use.  Yeah, which is kind of a bummer, because you just sit there going, like, hey, man,  like, I never did that myself.  You know, because the thing that hits you with is, like, you know, you were, I am where  you were once.  Right.  You were me once.  And it's like, I was never you, because I never asked anybody for anything.  You know, I put it on my fucking credit cards and shit like that.  Go into debt, you idiot.  Yeah, exactly.  It's just like, I can't help you out, man.  Or I could, but, like, why would I?  Like, I'd rather help out my friends who want to make a movie, people I've known for  fucking years, not total strangers. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, what was your favorite movie of the year, Kevin?  Last year?  Yeah.  I mean, Oscar's right around the corner here.  I think, I did a list online.  I think it was War of the Worlds.  I loved War of the Worlds.  I still haven't seen War of the Worlds.  I could watch that movie again and again and again.  I mean, it has, like, a kind of bullshit ending where you're very, like, last few minutes.  The reviews were kind of shaky on that when it came out.  Not that we should, like, follow every review.  Totally.  I mean, and I could see where some of the complaints were.  I thought it was fucking gripping.  Visually, it was great.  The best time I had in a movie theater.  You know what?  I'm going to go home and watch that tonight now because it's on my on-demand. 
[00:53:30]  I'm like, I'm looking for a movie every week and I always pass and say, I just don't want  to see War of the Worlds.  It's good.  Like, it's really, like, he's, Spielberg sets up a mood, man, and then keeps that tension  going throughout the fucking flick.  Yeah.  What were some of the other movies you liked?  I liked Brokeback quite a bit.  Did you see it?  Yeah, I saw it.  I thought it was, like, incredibly poignant.  That's what I did.  I came in and I'm, like, of course, jumping in the barrel with these motherfuckers.  And I said, I liked it.  Yeah.  It was good.  It's a love story. 
[00:54:00]  It's very much a love story.  But, you know, it's two guys.  Two dudes.  There's an issue there.  There's a couple of points where, as a guy, you're just watching and you go, ah, Jesus.  Right.  The moment where he spits in his fucking palm and rubs it in his cock and just grills the  dude from behind.  Just drills him hard.  The tent scene.  You know, you got to sit there and go, all right.  That doesn't say love.  I don't know.  I don't know what does it.  You know what?  And we were even talking about how, all right, you know, two guys ass sex in the tent.  Right.  Savage sex is one thing. 
[00:54:30]  It was that more disturbing was the thrown against the wall kissing.  Yes.  It's like, that's so.  That was kind of.  And also, there's a scene in the movie, like, where he throws them against the wall and  they start making out where he hasn't seen them in a few years.  Yeah, yeah.  And meanwhile, like, his wife is, like, 10 feet away.  The look on her face.  Within eyesight.  Like, there's just, they throw caution to the wind and they're making out.  In the middle of this community, it would fucking drag them behind their truck if they  could.  And that was the one moment where I was like, all right, I get it. 
[00:55:00]  The idea is, like, these two dudes are so passionate about one another, they would throw  caution to the wind.  But it's like, if they'd moved five feet to the left, they would have been hidden.  Nobody would have seen them.  There's no threat whatsoever.  Get under the stairs.  It's like, I'm all for passion, but logic has to factor in there somewhere.  But I thought it was a really wonderful movie about the road not taken more than anything  else.  Like, how some people will fucking live their lives not doing what they want to do or  trying to do what they want to do because of a societal norm or just because, oh, it could  never work out, like, just shitting on their own dreams. 
[00:55:30]  And that, to me, is where it really worked and where it's kind of poignant and whatnot.  I mean, a lot of people, like, it's the gay cowboy movie.  There's about a minute and 30 seconds of gayness in that whole movie.  Ah, should have been longer.  Yeah.  That was some hot gayness.  I wouldn't mind being fucked in the ass.  Just don't cup my chin and look me in the eyes.  That's what would creep me out.  There is a lot of longing looks and whatnot.  It was the oddest thing with that movie was the first sex scene where the guy's in the  tent, the other guy's cold in the sleeping bag outside.  Did you feel it was kind of abrupt? 
[00:56:00]  And it was like, wait a minute, you know, now they're fucking.  Yeah.  It was so quick.  It's kind of come out of nowhere and it wasn't like, some people have gone back and forth  with it about me going like, no, you could see them laying the seeds and whatnot.  You could kind of see a little, but not that much.  It's not like there was a shot like where one dude, like, there was a shot where one of  them had her shirt off and the other dude was washing up, but it wasn't like the other  dude was looking at the other dude with a shirt off and you kind of get the sense of  like, well, I think he might like that dude with the shirt off.  It was like they were in a tent and they were kind of cold and one dude pulls the arm of 
[00:56:30]  the other dude over.  Yeah.  And then it was Jake Gyllenhaal pulls Heath Ledger's arm over them.  Heath Ledger wakes up and reacts poorly to it.  Yeah.  And then Jake Gyllenhaal starts kissing him.  And then Heath Ledger literally spits in his fucking palm, rubs in his cock, pulls his pants  down and starts fucking him.  And you're like, is that all it takes?  I've been very close to dudes over my life.  I've slept in the same bed with Muse.  Who knew that fucking if I had my arm over him, fucking he'd wake up if it was fucking  home.  Five degrees colder. 
[00:57:00]  That's it.  Thank God the heat was on.  Yeah.  I thought that was a good movie.  But really well made movie.  Really totally.  It looked great.  Will it win all the awards, you think?  I think it's going to win Best Picture.  It's foregone conclusion it wins Best Picture.  Sadly, I don't think Heath Ledger is going to win Best Actor.  I think Philip Seymour Hoffman was taking it for Capote.  He was amazing in Truman Capote.  He was great in all props to him.  I think he's a fucking brilliant actor.  He was a little long.  But at the same time, it's the Jamie Foxx, Ray Charles thing. 
[00:57:30]  I give it up to him for pulling off Truman Capote, but at the same time, it's an impression.  Thank you.  You might as well give-  Holy shit.  Why not first time someone's agreeing with me here?  And I am not taking anything away from him.  He did a great job.  But between him and Heath Ledger, Heath Ledger created a character, and who knew fucking Heath  Ledger could act?  Yeah.  He was amazing in that movie.  You stop thinking about him as being Heath Ledger, and you're like, this is a dude that  fucking exists.  One of those quiet, fucking sad people that you've come across in your life and shit.  Friends of your parents and whatnot.  Dudes who apparently wanted to fuck your dad. 
[00:58:00]  Now you find out why they're so quiet.  But that dude really created a character from scratch, so much so that you get lost and  you forget who he is.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, while great in Capote, has basically had shit to go from.  He knows what Truman Capote sounds like.  You can go back and listen to recordings.  You can watch him in that movie Murder by Death.  And to me, it's like, well, why not give fucking Rich Little an Oscar?  Yeah, Rich Little on Carson doing Capote.  Exactly.  Isn't that also the same thing that could sink you, though?  The fact that everybody can kind of go to this guy and say, so it's as easy as it makes 
[00:58:30]  it for you to do it, it also makes it that much harder, because people can make a relative  comparison and go, eh, no.  I would agree, but at the same time, you're not talking about somebody who the whole world  knows.  Like Truman Capote, you really have to be kind of well-versed in the field of literature  or arcane fucking pop culture to know who Truman Capote was and what he sounded like.  It'd be one thing if he was playing fucking George Bush, and everybody goes, all right,  we all know what this dude sounds like. 
[00:59:00]  A lot of people don't necessarily know what Capote sounds like.  But you're right.  If he didn't pull it off, it could have been horrible.  But at the same time, he's not playing a guy where if he didn't pull it off, the whole  world would be like, you fucking ruined Truman Capote.  You got most of the world going, who the fuck was Truman Capote?  Dude, I think if you're going to give an Oscar for best actor, it should be based on a performance  of somebody.  Yeah, like you said, hey, this guy created a character from nowhere, and it's so believable,  and this guy's doing a great impression of Truman Capote. 
[00:59:30]  It was a sublime impression.  Like, boy, he really fucking...  If you watch that movie Murdered by Death, and then you watch Capote, you're like, that  guy fucking nailed it.  He is more Truman than fucking Truman was himself.  I think he should have gotten an Oscar for Boogie Nights.  Yeah, totally.  That was a fantastic character.  And there's a character, totally created character.  Oh, yeah.  You bought that.  You forgot that dude was an actor, and you're like, even when he's holding the board with  two hands, and he's holding a pen in his mouth, you're like, that fucking dude exists.  My favorite scene in that is when he's trying to hold the boom mic, and the sex starts, 
[01:00:00]  and he's like...  He can't even fucking breathe.  It's hysterical.  You know what's great?  I saw Mission Impossible 3.  J.J. Abrams showed me a girly kind of movie.  You bastard.  It is fucking awesome.  Is it?  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the most sinister, crimson, believable screen villain you've  ever fucking seen in your life.  Yeah.  Like, the scariest screen villain since, like, Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, where  you're like, this dude is fucking scary.  And not scary, like, you know, they show you villains all the time, where it's like, I'm 
[01:00:30]  going to kill you, and it's not that scary.  Especially if they deliver it like that.  Exactly.  I'm going to kill you.  That's the performance.  Especially after 9-11 now, every terrorist they show in a movie is still German.  Yes.  Or Russian Euro trash.  That's fucking realistic.  Hans Gruber.  Totally.  Right.  That's, I am Christian.  We know.  We understand.  We know.  But this dude pulls, he's, Philip Seymour Hoffman is so fucking disturbing in the movie.  Like, if you've seen that trailer online, where he's going, like, do you have a girlfriend? 
[01:01:00]  Like, what's even more impressive about that scene is he's in, in that scene, he is in the  submissive position.  Like, he's been captured at this point, and he's still fucking, like, just sitting there  talking to Cruz, going, I'm going to hurt her.  I'm going to hurt her, and then I'm going to kill you in front of her.  And you buy it.  He's so fucking good in the movie.  You got to see it.  It's a tremendous flick.  Like, I saw, you know, I was watching it last night, and I couldn't get enough, but  a fucking grizzly man was on.  Oh, you watched that?  I told you.  Dude, I told you.  I didn't see the whole thing, because I had to get to bed for this.  I saw, like, an hour and a half of it, or an hour and 20 minutes of it. 
[01:01:30]  I really liked that guy.  He was a bit of an ass, but I wound up liking Timothy Treadwell.  Oh, you did?  Dude, I liked him.  I really liked Tim Treadwell.  I was, like, so happy that he got eaten.  Showed it a bear.  Liked him a lot.  Yeah.  I wound up enjoying the movie.  That guy decided to commit suicide, man.  I liked him a lot, man.  You can't do that.  You didn't see the end of the movie yet?  Not yet, no.  You can't sit there and cavort with bears and not expect to get fucking eaten.  Oh, he was a douche, but I mean, I just kind of felt for him at one point.  But did you read the story about those two bears that just euthanized?  There's two bears who, I guess they had them in some kind of zoo-like preserve or something 
[01:02:00]  like that, and this four-year-old got through three different barriers, aided and abetted  by his parents, apparently, to take a picture as close to a bear as possible.  Holy.  Didn't get mauled by the bear, got kind of scratched or hit by the bear, and it's a question  as to whether or not it was, whether he was actually hit or scratched by the actual bear.  But there was the place that, I don't know if it's a zoo or a preserve or something, immediately  opted to euthanize the bears and then check them for rabies. 
[01:02:30]  That's amazing.  And now the town's in an uproar because they didn't clear it with the town, and the town  is maintaining, like, look, this is on our property.  So you had to confer with us first, and you didn't.  Now there's a massive investigation.  But you sit there going, what kind of asshole parent gets their kid through two fucking  barriers to get close to a wild animal?  Did the kid die or just get hurt?  No, the kid didn't hurt.  The kid barely got hurt.  But now they have to kill the bears.  It's not like he was in the hospital, but he put the bears down.  I hate that shit.  Yeah.  Like when someone gets too close at a zoo and they grab the coat and yank you into the...  And they're like, we gotta kill it.  They gotta taste for human blood. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ever see the...  Because the animal is doing what it's supposed to do.  Totally.  You ever see the polar bear one where he's ripping at the lady's...  Oh, that's the greatest footage ever taken.  But they ended up killing the polar bear because the lady was stupid enough to be that close.  A couple years ago, about a year or two ago in Jersey, right by Six Flags, by Great  Adventure, I guess there was a lady that had some wild animals who I guess used to be...  Yes, yes.  I remember the story.  And she had a tiger, and the tiger got out.  And for the first day, she was kind of going like, what?  I don't have any tiger. 
[01:03:30]  Everyone knew her as the tiger lady.  But she didn't want to cop to it because it's illegal to have a fucking wild animal.  Of course.  So they captured the tiger, and they put the fucking tiger...  The tiger did nothing.  Strolled around, didn't attack anybody and shit, and then they still chose to euthanize.  You'd think they could just dump them somewhere where they belong in India or something.  Apparently in this lady's yard.  Yeah.  That's where it was, but just got out one day.  Or a zoo or something.  Let her just hang out.  Fucking...  I don't know.  I don't like hunting.  Take shit out of its natural element and then decide to kill it.  They do the same thing with sharks, though.  Shark attacks. 
[01:04:00]  They go nuts.  They're like, we gotta kill it.  And it's like, dude, you are throwing yourself in harm's way.  You step into the ocean.  It's an eating machine.  Totally.  That's like the story of every summer.  You know, if it's a slow news week, they focus on the shark attacks and it's epidemic.  Remember 2001, like right before September 11th hit?  There was that whole...  That was the summer of shark attacks.  Yep.  And you could not open up a paper without reading about it and shit.  And then September 11th happened and people were like, fuck the sharks.  Yeah.  We gotta worry about people again.  We got something real to talk about finally. 
[01:04:30]  We went through some stats here on the show.  We did our own research about shark attacks and deaths related to shark attacks.  And it turned out more people were killed by vending machines falling on them.  Get out of here.  Than shark attacks every year.  Not a sexy story.  The vending machine falling on you.  Like you're just going crazy trying to get that and it falls over and kills you.  More dangerous than sharks.  It wouldn't be a good movie.  Robert Shaw and Scheider attacking a vending machine.  Give me my change, you son of a bitch.  Talking about the vending machine on the Indianapolis. 
[01:05:00]  You know, anyway, we delivered the bomb.  There was a...  I'll never try to buy a Hershey bar again.  A great DVD I watched last year is called Anatomy of a Shark Bite.  Did you ever see it?  It was like a Discovery Channel special, I think.  And it was people talking...  Oh, is that the guy with the pressure sensitive equipment?  Yeah, they created like...  That part of the show was kind of bullshit.  Where they're like, we're going to have a team of experts create a shark and show you what it would look like.  You know, and they had these mechanics, like movie mechanics, people that work on special effects and scientists all recreating the bite radius and the pressure and shit like that. 
[01:05:30]  That part was just such a waste of money.  But they had interviews with people who survived attacks and fucking footage.  And they have this one footage, a piece of footage of this girl in the water falling off this fucking boat.  She was a cook on some, not so much a cruise ship, but it's kind of like a day cruise ship or something like that.  Not like a Pacific Princess, like love boat kind of thing, but something that goes out for a day.  It's got like 50 people on it.  And so there's two boats in the water.  That one and another boat, a smaller vessel, holds about 10 people and they go out and cruise this area. 
[01:06:00]  I think it was in Australia.  Chick fell off the boat.  She's swimming toward the, and it's somebody on a third boat with a fucking camera who's just like, hey, this chick fell in the water.  I'm going to shoot this footage.  And all of a sudden you see her.  She's coming back to the fucking boat.  This fucking just shadow come up from under.  Oh, man.  And fucking take her right down.  And the screaming and then suddenly the camera work starts herky jerking around.  You see blood in the water.  She bobs down.  She gets back up. 
[01:06:30]  These dudes throw a pole at her.  She's grabbing onto the pole.  They're all struggling to get to her.  And you see the fucking fin flapping back and forth.  And then they yank her out of the water and you just see her leg get left behind, like from the hip all the way down.  It was fucking frightening.  And you're just sitting there going, this is the best piece of footage I've ever seen in my life.  Like, thank God somebody had a camera so bad for her.  And then they interview her and she's alive.  She lived through it.  But she's missing her leg from the, you know, from the hip down.  Her right or left leg.  I forget which one.  And they're sitting there talking to her about it. 
[01:07:00]  And, you know, it's years later.  So she's pretty calm about it.  She's happy to have her life and shit.  But you know it's got to eat at her in some place.  Like, you survived it.  But, like, you think about it.  Like, something fucking ate you.  And then shit you out.  You know?  It was like, and that was it.  Like, what an insult that is.  You know?  It's not like it took your life.  It ate your fucking leg.  Shit it out.  Never thought about you again.  Didn't even think about it.  And for you, that is a defining moment in your life.  And for that fucking beast, it was just like, yeah, I ate something once.  I don't remember.  You reach over and grab a french fry and throw it in your mouth. 
[01:07:30]  Totally.  Didn't even enjoy your, like, sneaker.  Yeah, probably didn't like it.  There was too much pressure.  You know, everyone watching and shit like that.  Didn't get a full meal.  But it's so weird.  The notion of something eating you and then just crapping you out and that's it.  And that'll affect you for the rest of your fucking life.  I think the fact that she's alive makes it a little better.  Like, think of those people that get lost and eaten.  And just completely eaten.  Gone.  You never existed.  You're just gone.  And they get shit out.  That's the weird part to me.  It's like the shitting out part.  Like, you were just some part of somebody's fucking food chain. 
[01:08:00]  That's it.  You gave them a little energy to last another day.  You mattered to them for like 16 hours.  That's it.  A little protein.  There was one point where you were touching your kid's head and educating them.  And the next thing, you were a log floating in the Pacific.  Let's go to Kent, the movie guy.  Kent, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  I just get home, turn it on, and Kevin Smith, my fucking god, is on the radio.  Where are you?  Oh, my God.  You are my hero.  Oh, thank you, man. 
[01:08:30]  Yes.  You get a lot of this, do you, Kevin?  People don't know what to say to you.  A little bit, enough where you sit there going, I feel okay.  You're very recognizable is what it is, too.  Yeah, because I've been in the flicks.  Yeah, you've been in the movies, so everywhere you go, you get people coming up to you.  Yeah, it's not like I've been out in the world with Affleck, and that's just, I don't  understand how somebody could live like that.  It's a whole nother level.  Oh, it's fucking insane.  But like me, I can go to a food store, and every once in a while, I've got people going,  you look like Silent Bob.  And I'm like, yeah, I get that a lot.  Yeah, thanks.  But if I go to something like a comic book show, like we went to the comic book show this weekend, 
[01:09:00]  that's when I'm like Affleck and shit.  You know, get my dick sucked by anybody in that room.  But it's really very, it's so manageable.  And every once in a while, I get people who are like, oh, you're awesome, and thanks.  Yeah.  But yeah, it's totally cool.  So, sorry, you still on the line?  Yes.  Well, you're on the phone.  I'm just in awe.  What do you want to say to Kevin?  It's like, you got him here now.  Your hero is here.  What would you like to say to him?  He's meant a lot to you.  He's right here.  Thank you for your work.  It is the reason I make films myself. 
[01:09:30]  Awesome, sir.  I love all my friends.  I totally appreciate that.  You're just amazing, amazing.  How about a question, Ken?  What's the deal with Green Hornet at this point?  Green Hornet, I was attached to write and direct about last year, two years ago now.  And is it?  And I bowed out of directing because I realized that I'm just not talented enough to pull off  an action flick.  No way.  Oh, shut up.  It's true.  I'm not an action movie guy.  I like movies where people talk and stuff.  And I was just like, I can't do this. 
[01:10:00]  So I wound up just writing it and bowed out of directing it.  But you fought Mark Hamill.  I did.  But, you know, it's not like people are like, man, that's a gripping action scene.  People are like, oh, Mark, you had Luke Skywalker play Cockknocker.  Like, that's what they remember about it.  Not how it was shot.  Because of your own self-criticism, a lot of times, whenever me and my girlfriend are  watching one of your moves, we go, ooh, camera move.  Right.  Exactly.  Look at it.  He's moving it.  The next move, the Clerks 2 is actually, like, pretty visually accomplished.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Like, we were really happy with it.  It's kind of, cameras always move.  And there's a definite, there's thought behind what we did this time around.  Not just like, let's just shoot people talking.  It'll be fine.  There's actually some thought behind it.  But still, not enough for, not, I'm not in that mindset yet to get out there and try  to make an action movie.  Now, is the Green Hornet script, are you just being polite because the Green Hornet script  was awful and you didn't want to do it?  No, no, no.  Well, it was, well, I had to write it, so it could very well be awful.  I didn't know you wrote it, so it's obviously okay.  It could totally be awful.  But I wound up writing, I was going to write and direct it, but I wound up just writing it 
[01:11:00]  and somebody else, I presume, will direct it somewhere down the road or make their own  version.  They've had such a hard time making this Green Hornet movie.  It was in development at Universal for at least seven to ten years before I got involved  with it at Miramax and now it's gone from Miramax.  They can't seem to get it made.  And I think that has a lot to do with the fact that there's a familiarity with the Green  Hornet because of Bruce Lee, but there's no built-in audience.  You know, it's not like people are going like, it's not like you have the identity factor 
[01:11:30]  of a Spider-Man or an X-Men.  A lot of people, you know, people who know Green Hornet are people that don't go to the  movies anymore because they're like, oh, those fucking whippersnappers.  You know, they're like seven years old and shit.  But it kind of worked for Batman because people are very familiar with that franchise.  And then the last one that came out was fantastic, I thought.  Yeah, totally.  Absolutely.  But also Batman, like you would have to be, Batman is part of the pop cultural mainstream.  It's so iconic.  Like when they first launched that series of flicks in 89, they had ages of familiarity 
[01:12:00]  with the character from not just the TV show, but fucking the cartoons.  Like everyone knows Batman.  Right.  You don't even have to know comic books to know Batman.  Green Hornet, not so much.  Walk into like the average, walk into a supermarket, ask a hundred people, do you know what Green  Hornet is?  And most people would be like, floor cleaner?  You know.  I don't think you get a lot of people going, oh yeah, there's a radio show that they turned  into a TV show with Van Williams and Bruce Lee.  And they've done it as a small series of comic books.  You know, I don't think a lot of people have that built-in familiarity. 
[01:12:30]  I bet everybody knew what the Comic-Con, though.  Totally.  That place?  Absolutely.  But that's why like comic book movies are, for a long time, people weren't, were kind  of daunted by the idea of making them.  Because now they've figured out a way to do it where it's like retell the origin story  and go mainstream with it and lose some of the cool things about a comic book character  that you do like so that you can get out there into the mainstream.  Because if you think about it, like the best-selling comic book on every given week is what?  Let's say the average right now is 100,000 books.  Yeah.  100,000 people go out to see a movie on opening weekend, pay 10 bucks. 
[01:13:00]  How much is that?  A million dollars?  You've spent 70, 80 to make a movie?  Yeah.  That's not great.  How about the Fantastic Four?  Didn't that not do well?  Fantastic Four did pretty well, yeah.  It actually wound up doing well, which is amazing because that movie was such fucking piece  of shit.  Piece of dog shit.  Yeah.  I keep seeing it on cable and I won't even like-  I don't have any real ambitions.  I mean, it was such a- imagine like trying to follow the Incredibles, which was like Fantastic  Four done right, and then they did that movie and just so not good.  Like the ending battle sequence, Dr. Doom comes out of a garbage truck at one point. 
[01:13:30]  Like there's no grandeur to it whatsoever.  And they're making a sequel.  Yeah.  Well, it made a lot of money.  It made what, 160, 170 or something?  I didn't see it.  I mean, after all my work on Spider-Man, I just decided-  You are looking at Surly Truck Driver from Spider-Man.  Like he doesn't know that.  What part of Spider-Man?  Well, you know, there was like a bunch of man on the street stuff.  Right.  And I was kind of the critical turning point of the film where I said he stinks and I  don't like him.  Where's the club? 
[01:14:00]  You were that dude?  That was me.  Right on, man.  How was that?  Well, it's been a lot of pressure to kind of follow that up in my career.  The bar sits so high first time out.  Oh, here he is.  Here it is.  This is his actual line from Spider-Man.  Here he is.  He stinks and I don't like him.  There you go.  What do you think?  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  You know what?  He's got talent, right?  Sir, you are the next Ben Affleck.  Yeah, but you should have seen the look.  You know what I mean?  I looked.  I wasn't just standing.  I was loading.  I was looking.  It was very busy.  I remember that part of the movie.  And you were Surly.  Yes.  Which is the most important part of a Surly truck driver. 
[01:14:30]  And there was a truck there.  I mean, the whole thing was-  How did it all come together?  How did you wind up doing that?  So I'm like, low self-esteem.  I'm like, I'm not going to audition.  So I went out and they had the improv dialogue.  So I just trashed Spider-Man.  And he sucks and all that shit.  So they put me on the street.  I got it.  And it was all second year.  I didn't get to meet Raimi.  And 45 minutes of just talking.  Right.  I did a few, like, you know, load jokes.  And they're like, ah, this is for kids.  Right, right.  I do that.  Load jokes.  Yeah, just fucking, like, you know, web jerk-off references. 
[01:15:00]  And that was just the one line they left in.  It was a miracle I even got left in the film.  So did you know when the movie was coming out that you were going to be in it?  Or were you sitting there watching it going, I'm in this fucking movie?  I'm in a blockbuster.  Jesus.  This is amazing.  I had moved by that point from Jersey to New York.  So the invitation to the premiere I get, like, months later when my mail was forwarded.  But I found out, like, when the listeners called in that day, we were on NAW.  And they were like, dude, you made the flick.  And somebody played the clip that day.  That's how I found out I was actually.  You forgot about that.  You're right.  What a delightful surprise.  I was like, that must have made you a week.  Or, like, the next two fucking weeks. 
[01:15:30]  I still get checks for that.  Call up everyone you know going, go fucking see Spider-Man.  I still get checks for that.  I mean, it was, like, a grand for one day.  It was a great pay.  And I still get checks because that movie has made so much.  Like, $35, $50 checks.  But it's, like, when it goes on a DVD or it goes on a series.  $35, $50, but you were in the movie for about maybe 10 seconds.  Possibly.  And my nephew loves it.  Imagine the checks that fucking what's-his-name gets.  Tobey Maguire.  Oh, dude, he probably made $50, $80 off that film.  Could be a couple more dollars than that, Jimmy.  Let's go to Nate in Utah.  Nate, what's up today? 
[01:16:00]  What's happening, guys?  Hey, man.  All I want to say is, Kevin, thank you for lots and lots of laughs, man.  Oh, right on.  Thank you, sir.  That's it?  Yep, that's it.  All right.  So, uh, Mew's in the, uh, Clerks 2?  Mew's in the Clerks 2 as well.  He comes in, and we have a-  Jay and Silent Bob have about as much screen time as we had in the first Clerks.  The first one, yeah.  It's really like Dante and Randall's movie.  Yeah, so was the first one.  He's so fucking gorgeous, so talented.  Really like charming actors.  I've watched, uh, Clerks, the original, so many goddamn times, and then, uh, the DVD. 
[01:16:30]  The, uh, you've, you've fallen into that thing of making me buy it about three or four times.  Thank you.  I gotta appreciate that.  So not my idea.  So not my idea.  But this is everybody.  Every DVD I own, I own three copies of.  Right.  Because I have to get it right when it comes out.  And then, and then it's just there in its little cardboard box with the DVD.  I have at least ten.  Barely a booklet at that point.  Yeah.  Ten versions of, uh, Terminator 2 and Evil Dead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They constantly come out with variations. 
[01:17:00]  I got the Godfather, Goodfellas, shit like that, where it's just like, I got ten.  Anytime they're like, now we got a documentary where you can see the cast ten years later,  I'm like, give me it.  Gotta say it.  Totally.  Yeah.  I roped into Clueless, buying Clueless, because I was like, I gotta see what they all look  like ten years later.  Yeah.  And I was, I was watching it and, uh, watched all the behind the scenes stuff and the exclusive.  Uh, some of the funniest stuff is the, um, when you, you leave the dialogue on between  all you guys as you're watching the movie. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, the commentary tracks.  Hysterical.  It's fun.  I like doing this.  Drinking.  I just, I, look, I don't know what was going on, but it seemed to me the longer it went on,  the, the more Affleck started talking.  Right.  And, uh, the little slurring was happening.  Right, right, right.  Muse, and that commentary track's for the, for the first, the first commentary track,  which we recorded for the Clerks Laser Disc, like, which we recorded on the set of Mall  Rats, back on Laser Disc.  Yeah, yeah.  Muse was there and he was drinking, and by the end of the commentary track, he's just 
[01:18:00]  unintelligible.  And you just hear him like, ah, fuck you.  Yeah.  Pretty funny stuff.  What do you think as a director, best director's film you've ever seen?  I don't, if it's Citizen Kane, let's go asterisk, okay, anything like that.  Right, let's say Citizen Kane is, is, is the, is the bar, and, and, and go beyond that.  Um, I, I think Jaws is an insanely well-directed movie.  JFK is an insanely well-directed movie.  Um, Last Temptation of Christ is an insanely well-directed movie.  Spielberg's got a technique that is so recognizable that, I mean, I've watched old, like, Universal, 
[01:18:30]  Universal Studios' Columbo.  Right.  And I'm watching it and going, that's fucking Spielberg.  And he did it.  And at the end, you see, Spielberg directed, you know, that, that episode of Columbo.  Right.  And you can tell by, you know, what he's doing with the camera that it's Spielberg.  That guy's-  That, to me, is amazing.  That guy is a genius.  Something like that is recognizable.  Some people will bitch about him and be like, oh, he's fucking this, he's too Spielbergian,  blah, blah, blah.  Spielbergian.  But he, I mean, whether you love or hate any given movie of his, you have to cop to the 
[01:19:00]  fact that that dude is really a genius at what he does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How about Clockwork Orange?  I love that movie.  I mean, Kubrick is a fantastic, was a fantastic character.  Yeah.  That's another one who you look at-  The Shining yesterday was on TV.  Yeah.  And that's a movie that even when it's cut up on TV, I'll still fucking watch it.  He's another one, though.  Totally.  You see his movies and you're like, those stark wide shots, tracking wide shots.  What about the slow push-in like that with the stark walls?  What about Caddyshack 2? 
[01:19:30]  Caddyshack 2, Back to the Shack?  Fantastic.  We were directed.  Great.  Great.  I see the Pink Panther made a lot of money over the weekend.  How much did it make total?  It should have made nothing.  I think they were up to 60.  It's up to $61 million.  All right.  Is that bad?  How much did they spend on it?  They spent about 70, I think.  It's a success.  Yeah.  Because then you got the DVDs and everything else.  That's the thing.  Basically, if they can ring the bell of what they made shooting the flick, if they can  win at the box office, the DVD will take care of it. 
[01:20:00]  We get very pissed off about movies like Pink Panther, The Honeymooners.  We're like, why are you making a Honeymooners movie?  I don't think they're going to make another Pink Panther, though, after this, because it  didn't make enough money for them to warrant going back.  And this was on the shelf for a while, right?  Yeah.  They shelved it because it was so bad.  Now they put it out when there's nothing else happening.  But Steve Martin, of all people, it's like he's one of the funniest guys ever.  He's such a good actor and he does this dog shit, spit in the face of Peter Sellers.  It was like, why do you do it?  It's not a CGI movie.  Yeah, why would you step into those shoes?  It's a role that was so insanely defined by somebody else. 
[01:20:30]  Just leave them unfilled now.  Yeah, it's just like, what's the point?  And the studio perspective is like, well, if we don't remake these movies, we can't get  an audience to go see these movies.  So let's remake them for another generation.  I mean, it's a vulgar grab at a dollar, essentially.  And the one to me, which was the most insulting and the one I was most outraged by.  Can I guess?  In-laws?  No, Bad News Bears.  Oh, yeah.  Bad News Bears is a brilliant fucking movie.  We just talked about that a couple weeks ago.  I mean, I love Richard Linklater, the guy that directed it, but there was no reason to  remake it.  I understand why I did it.  They were like, we'll give you six million bucks to head it up. 
[01:21:00]  Like, why not?  I finally watched that on demand and I was so pissed off and went out the next day and  got the original to just get the original back in my head.  I was talking a quick note about it.  And I thought it would be good because of Billy Bob Thornton.  I'm like, oh my God, he was made to play this role.  And I get mad when they remake comedies, especially.  But then he's got the kids drinking non-alcoholic beers.  He's drinking non-alcoholic beers.  They're not cursing.  Meanwhile, Walter Matthau was drinking as he's driving with the kid in the car.  No seatbelts.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  There was, I was talking to Quentin about it before I saw that movie because I'd  asked him, I was like, what'd you like last year?  And he said, I like the Bad News Bears a lot.  I was like, get out of here.  Really?  He goes, yeah, it's like a really good cover tune.  Like, you know, it's like basically it calls to mind everything about the original that  you like.  And I thought that was an interesting perspective.  And then I watched the movie.  I'm like, I'd rather see the original.  I'd rather not have the original call to mind.  I'd rather just flat out watch the original.  Greg Kinnear was just not believable as the nasty coach.  Greg Kinnear just fucking slapped his fucking kid down on the mound. 
[01:22:00]  And he doesn't, Greg Kinnear doesn't slap his kid.  He gives him, he slaps his hat off of him.  And then he kind of gives him a push and the kid falls back.  Something tells me that was Vic Morrow not acting.  Totally.  He's just like, he always came off as a guy that would have just smacked his kid like  that.  And no one is scared of Greg Kinnear.  After As Good As It Gets, no one is as frightened of him after it.  Remember the character you played?  Yeah, right.  Fucking flamboyant sissy.  It's like you're not slapping anybody.  And he also, he just seems like he's like playing the aggro funny dad in the movie. 
[01:22:30]  Like, Vic Morrow seemed like a real guy.  Yeah.  Greg Kinnear's playing a character.  And Vic Morrow's performance, you never got the impression like this guy is acting like  somebody else.  Just like, this dude exists.  Yeah.  He's one of those asshole parents that I knew in Little League.  He smacked the kid from Courtship of Eddie's father.  Like, Brendan Cruz.  That movie, it's such an unsung fucking gem, man.  Like, that first bad, the original Bad News Bears.  Like, it's insane the performances he got out of those kids.  Right.  You're sitting there going, like, there's no performances here whatsoever. 
[01:23:00]  Like, they just rolled a documentary camera on this Little League team.  Yeah, because the acting with the kids in the new movie is so bad.  It takes you right out of the movie.  It's just like, it's like watching, you know, fucking Fresh Prince of Bel-Air or something  like that.  Knocks his hat off.  And the girl who played, like, remember Tatum O'Neill, how brilliant she was in the movie?  The chick that plays Amanda in this movie is just not good.  Her acting, I'm like, oh, it could be the worst acting I've ever seen.  And you sit there going, well, I guess maybe she's really good at baseball or something.  Right, right, right.  When he did School of Rock, he hired a bunch of kids who weren't actors.  He hired kids that could actually play instruments. 
[01:23:30]  And so I'd heard that, like, for Bad News Bears, he was doing the same thing.  He's like, well, he's not necessarily going for kids who are actors.  He's going for kids who are baseball players.  And then in some of the outtake footage on that new Bad News Bears disc, they show that  girl throwing a ball, and she's not great.  Oh, that bad either.  She hits a piece of equipment or something like that.  And so you're like, well, then why did he hire that girl?  But I thought making that movie was just sacrilegious, because the original's so good.  And they're like, yeah, but kids won't watch the original.  And you're like, well, fuck kids then.  Then they don't deserve it.  Yeah, then come up with something else.  Totally. 
[01:24:00]  Come up with something new.  Make another Mighty Ducks.  Same premise.  Bag-tag kids.  You know, give them that.  But don't fucking touch something new.  Mighty Ducks without skates.  Why is it like the last 10 years?  I mean, there's been some great movies made, but why is this obsession with remakes, man?  Is there shitty scripts floating around?  I think it's just people going like, well, we know this is going to make money.  We know there was a built-in audience for it once.  Maybe there's another built-in audience for it.  It's kind of pre-sold.  They like pre-sold.  Everyone likes the safe bet.  I mean, it's a business, right?  Like, they just want to see returns on their fucking dollar.  There's probably more of a DVD market for the remake than there is the original also. 
[01:24:30]  And also, you get basically a bump, too.  If you release Bad News Bears, you release the old Bad News Bears on DVD.  They always do that.  Again, and you get another bump.  Like when they try to fool you on cable.  Yeah.  When a new movie comes out, a remake, and they play the old one, you're looking and going,  wait, that's still in the...  Oh, yeah.  Right.  What about them again?  No, I want to see if they're going to remake the taking of Pelham 123 with Martin Lawrence.  I think they did remake it.  Yeah, Money Train with that stupid Woody Harrelson.  No, no, I think they actually remade it with Vincent D'Onofrio. 
[01:25:00]  I was kidding.  I swear to you.  Like a TV version?  Like a TV movie, yeah.  The Money Train was a rip-on.  We can IMDb it and find out right now.  Yeah, I know.  Greatest site ever.  Fantastic.  What did we do before the internet?  Like, did people actually rush and grab an encyclopedia and leaf through it?  I'll tell you what they did.  What did they do?  Because my mother insists on still doing it.  We've tried to get her to use a computer.  She will not...  Electronics scare...  They scare the shit out of her.  And we tell her it's so convenient.  You want pictures from us on vacation?  We can email them to you. 
[01:25:30]  I don't want to...  Oh, no, no, no.  So we tell her about Internet Movie Database because she's huge with movies.  Loves movies.  Right.  For that site alone, get a computer.  Totally.  She won't.  She goes, nope, every year...  And this is what everybody does that doesn't have a computer, I guess.  I buy my Leonard Maltin book.  Oh, she gets that book?  This thick encyclopedia that she has to thumb through to try to cross-reference.  If you want to cross-reference something on IMDb, it's easy.  Totally.  She's there, like, studying.  She's got a card catalog in her house with Leonard Maltin books. 
[01:26:00]  Built on the Dewey Decimal System.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  That's in the 800s.  She will not get a computer.  The way to get her over her computer phobia is tell her you've got fans fucking online.  There you go.  Well, you want to see some pictures, Mom?  Mom, I'll get you a camera.  Let's go to Dave in Tennessee.  Hey, Dave, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Dave.  I just want to thank Kevin.  I met my wife because of his movies.  A bunch of us were sitting around, and she and I were the only ones that had heard of  Clerks, and got together, rented all the movies, hung out for the weekend, and that was it. 
[01:26:30]  And led to sex and love.  Right on, yeah.  So thank you very much.  Oh, no props.  Kevin Smith Film Festival.  That's pretty hot.  Having those at the house every so often, yeah.  That's pretty hot when people meet because they're like, have you ever seen this shitty  movie?  Yeah, I have.  Let's talk.  That's awesome.  Let's go to Robin Derby.  Clerks was one of those movies that I don't think I know anyone that saw it in the theater.  Yeah, totally.  It was one of those, dude, you've got to see this.  It only ever played on 50 screens around the country.  Really?  Like, never played on more than 50 screens, and it was a real, like, it played in the 
[01:27:00]  Angelica, in Los Angeles, it played at the Lemley.  Like, it was just total arthouse release.  Then it got passed around like a Jerky Boys tape, where it was like, you've got to see  this.  Totally.  I'm like, what?  I never heard of it.  And popped in, and it just grabbed me from the start.  Yeah.  And, yeah.  It had that discovery feeling to it, like where you felt like you found it before anyone  else, and you would pay it off to your friends and be like, you've got to see this.  Yeah, you've got to see this.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Robin Jersey.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys? 
[01:27:30]  Hey.  Wait for me to pile on the pressure, because I've listened to you guys for about a year  now, never called in.  Leave it to me to call in the day when one of the best filmmakers of the 90s is sitting  in with you guys.  So, I'm nervous as hell right now.  You're doing fine.  You're doing all right, except you're insulting me with the of the 90s part.  Yeah, exactly.  You're like, he's not relevant anymore, but back in the 90s, he was something.  From 93 to 94, he ruled.  And, sir, Quentin Tarantino is not here.  Exactly, sir.  Rob, don't think of the million people listening to you right now.  Don't worry about them.  It's just us and you. 
[01:28:00]  Well, I'm watching you guys on PalTalk, and I'm also representing newsaskew.com.  Oh, right on, sir.  A little plug.  And I was wondering if there's any way at all that I can grovel at Kevin's feet for his  super secret thing that was happening this evening.  Oh, for the screening?  We're all booked up.  We're showing clerks tonight.  Tonight, we're showing it to Harvey Weinstein with an audience for the first time.  Wow.  Pulled a bunch of people.  I didn't want to do this, the test screening thing, the traditional test screening, because  to do those, you hire a company like this company, NRG. 
[01:28:30]  They go out there and recruit the screening where they hang out at movie theaters and recruit  people coming out going, would you like to see a free screening of a movie, a test screening  of a movie?  And then you get a wide cross-section.  And they get a certain percentage of males, females, and different races, and not creeds  and colors, just races.  I was going to be like, race is creed, but they're not like, are you a Catholic?  Would you like to see this movie?  What is a creed?  Yeah, what is your creed, sir?  So they collect those people, and then you have a test screening.  I didn't want to do that because basically they're collecting a bunch of strangers, and 
[01:29:00]  then one of those cats is bound to write it up and throw it up on Any Cool News or Dark  Horizons or something.  And it's just too early to spoil the flick.  It's too early to let a lot of stuff, let the cat out of the bag.  Movie don't come out until August.  I guess we're not invited, Anthony.  We're booked up.  I guess we're not invited.  We'd be babbling like idiots tomorrow.  We're the guys you're talking about.  Totally.  Even if you said, look, you could come tonight, but please, do me a favor. 
[01:29:30]  We can't help ourselves.  By August, everyone would know every little nuance.  JJ Abrams said to me the other day, he's like, don't tell anyone you saw this movie yet.  And I was like, I won't.  And then I was just in here going, like, I saw Mission Impossible 3.  Can't help it.  You can't help yourself.  Because tomorrow you're not here.  Like, oh, my God, we saw Clerks 2.  This is how it is.  We're not going to tell you a lot, but I've got to tell you this one part.  And God forbid it sucks, too, because you're like, oh, we saw Clerks 2.  But we recruited the audience for this thing from our website, from the message board. 
[01:30:00]  And I basically just went through and picked out posters that have been posting there for  a long time.  That's pretty cool.  Who I knew wouldn't, you know, they wouldn't go out there and spoil it and write about  it on the web or send in fucking secret reports to other websites or something.  And some people have been like, well, that's just a loaded audience.  You're just putting fans in the audience.  And I'm like, well, who the fuck do you think Clerks 2 is for?  Yeah.  Like, you know, you would obviously people that like our stuff, you know, it's not like  we're going for like a completely fresh audience who's not familiar with our stuff in order  to go into any movie that has a two in the fucking title. 
[01:30:30]  You want them to be aware of the previous stuff.  Familiar with the one.  Exactly.  You know one of the fans is going to babble, though.  I don't know.  We had one of these screenings in Los Angeles in Burbank right before Christmas.  And everyone turned out to be cool about it?  Everyone turned out to be cool.  Nobody spoiled it.  So hopefully the New York cats, you know, ape the L.A. cats a little bit.  Keep it quiet.  By Wednesday, it's going to be burnt.  They'll be selling them on the street.  Exactly.  Bootleg cover.  That's always the danger.  Well, I got to take a leak.  It's been an hour and a half.  Wow.  So you guys take a break with a satellite? 
[01:31:00]  Well, occasionally we can throw on some shit.  We're supposed to take a break every half hour, but it never works out that way.  And what do they do during the break?  They don't run commercials, do they?  A few.  A couple of them.  Yeah, not a lot, though.  We got a new hard-on cream commercial that we're psyched about.  So we got that.  The idea behind satellite radio was like, you will never hear a commercial again.  That's usually on the music channel, so it's just straight music.  But talk guys, it's like, guys, we got to take a piss.  Right, right, right.  What the fuck are we supposed to do when we got a piss?  My omelet's been here since five after seven. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, it'll be tasty, Jim.  I haven't eaten it.  It's going to be real tasty.  I picture satellite radio talk radio as like a series of fucking empty milk jugs filled  with urine.  You know, dudes who can't get up from the mic.  Just take a leak in wide-mouth Snapple bottles.  Exactly.  We should do that one day.  Lock the studio door.  Completely Howard Hughes in the locker-on tissue boxes of pissing a bottle.  Are you hanging?  Are you going?  I'm here to, I got nothing else to do all morning, so if you guys want me out, that's  totally cool.  I'm not sure if you've got a bunch of shit to get to. 
[01:32:00]  This is it.  I certainly don't want it to become the fucking Kevin Smith show.  I'd love to hear your take on a lot of this stuff.  We could do all the stuff you normally do.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that, man.  That'll be fun.  We're hanging out with Kevin Smith today.  Stay there.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  And we're loving that.  Getting more gooder and a little bigger every day.  Right, Anthony?  That's what they tell me. 
[01:32:30]  That's what they call me.  I don't know if more gooder is not.  More gooder is perfectly acceptable.  Actually, it's more gooderer.  More gooderer.  Which is even bester.  Hey, how cool is this?  Kevin Smith, he's having such a good time, he's just going to hang out with us all morning.  You know what he's doing right now, though?  He's smoking.  He's smoking.  He's smoking.  But he's, I'm just wondering if he's leaning against the building just smoking a cigarette,  because that would be the oddest thing, walking down 57, turning your head, and seeing Silent  Bob sitting there, just standing against the wall, just smoking a butt. 
[01:33:00]  Is that what he's doing?  Yeah, Danny.  That's exactly what he's doing.  Is anyone looking at him and going, fuck, dude, that's Silent Bob.  Yeah.  How come I can't hear anything?  Oh, you're fine.  You're on.  Don't worry about you.  Where's the headphones?  He goes, yeah, because he's got that overcoat on, and he's just exactly how you'd expect.  It looked like it was the outside of the convenience store, of course.  It's a setup.  He's got the cigarette with the overcoat, and there he is just smoking a cigarette.  We should have brought the camera down there and taped that.  Well, I'm sure he'll go back down for another one next break. 
[01:33:30]  Get him on the next cigarette break.  By the smell of it, it seems like you might have went down and had a cigarette with Kevin.  I may have.  All the boys are smokers.  I have good times of smell, but I'm stuffed.  I can't tell.  I'm terrible.  I'm awful.  Trust me.  After Atlantic City, I could smell smoke.  Holy shit.  Why?  There's smoke down there.  How awful are the casinos down there with the smoke?  I fucking hate Atlantic City.  I want to go on the record and say that.  Atlantic City does really blow.  I had to go down there Saturday night, and I had a good time, because the reason I went  down there was great, but the place itself, ugh.  Only place to go, Borgata. 
[01:34:00]  Well, of course.  Borgata's the only place in Atlantic City to go.  You played at the Borgata, right, Jimmy?  She's the only place I work, A.C., in Borgata.  And we went down there.  We had a great time.  In the Borgata, you feel like you're in one of the new hotels in Vegas.  Five-star hotel.  It's unbelievable.  All the cocktail waitresses are all hot.  They wear the skimpy little things.  It's clean.  The hotel rooms are nice.  Everything's brand new.  The food is good.  Yeah.  And when I went down to Atlantic City, I don't go down there often.  I was wondering why the Borgata was so far away from everything else.  Now I know.  Yeah.  They don't want to be part of that. 
[01:34:30]  Nope.  Eventually, the Atlantic City near the boardwalk, that's going to be like old Vegas.  Yep.  Because I was at the Caesars Hotel, and I checked into my room, and they didn't give a shit.  So, well, I don't give a shit, and this is what I have to say.  Your hotel stinks.  Yep.  I got a room.  I looked out the window.  No view whatsoever.  Whatever.  I'm just there to crash.  There's a generator as big as this whole fucking studio right outside the window just going like this. 
[01:35:00]  So I called down.  I'm like, you're kidding.  You actually give people this room?  Yeah.  Save this for the maids or something.  You shouldn't be giving this to people.  I'm a high roller.  Spending their hard-earned money.  It's $400 a night, and this is what you get?  Yeah.  And, you know, I'm not fancy like Anthony.  I just need a place to sleep.  I don't give a shit.  I need to be calm when I go there.  Anthony needs a suite, and Ope runs three hots and a cot. 
[01:35:30]  So Ope is not high maintenance.  I really don't care.  But for $400, I care.  I'm like, what?  I'm not sleeping in a room with a generator right outside the window and garbage right outside the window  as you're looking at a brick wall.  Were the blueberries evenly distributed in the muffin?  The blueberries.  And, dude, I tell you, I had a similar experience in a hotel, which I got to.  You just remind me after.  Even worse than the generator.  And then I get it.  You know, the colors of the room, they're so awful because they don't want you in the room.  I get it.  I've seen the specials on fucking casinos. 
[01:36:00]  But could you, like, pretty it up a little bit?  Gussy it up?  You feel nauseous staying in the room because the colors are all fucked up.  And they do this on purpose because they don't want you to get comfortable in the hotel room.  They want you downstairs gambling.  Not in the Borgata, though.  That's what I mean.  But this is the point I'm making.  When you go to Vegas, even, they give you the really nice, fancy rooms.  They don't mind that when you are done gambling that you have a nice, relaxing location to go to.  This room, I swear to God, I was getting nauseous.  Like, what's wrong with me?  Do I have food poisoning?  And I realized it was the color schemes on the wallpaper and shit. 
[01:36:30]  And they're like, well, and they couldn't believe I was complaining.  I'm like, for 400 bucks, I don't want to, you know, sleep in a room where I have to hear a generator all night.  Yeah.  You know?  I had the same experience at the Tropicana over there.  Of course you did.  Ancient hotel with ancient people working there.  They didn't have any internet in the hotel rooms.  They had a hot tub in there that had this, you know, remember when digital watches first came out? 
[01:37:00]  There were red numbers, red, like, LCDs, LEDs.  That's what the control panel on this hot tub had.  And it was punched in.  So it was just this 70s hot tub, like the first one.  Never getting there.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Just an awful old room.  I had an alarm clock in my room that was, like, anchored down or whatever, so you couldn't pull it out of the walls.  Like, I don't want your stupid alarm clock.  What am I going to do with your stupid alarm clock from 1984? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Dude, I hated Caesars.  Hated it.  All those old casinos.  And they didn't give a shit that, you know, I had a bad room.  Finally, after I called three times, I'm like, look, this is just unacceptable.  They're like, well, we're having a car show, and there's, you know, the hotel is sold out.  I'm like, I can't sleep next to a fucking generator all night.  So finally they moved me up a couple floors, but.  And then after midnight, the casino itself, just completely, and I mean completely infested by hookers. 
[01:38:00]  Infested?  No, completely, like, to the point you're scared.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Where was this?  I had to go down to Atlantic City.  That's why I'm a little tired today, Kevin.  I had to drive back and forth, and I had a bad experience.  And you stayed at shitty Caesars.  We stayed at Caesars.  It was a family thing.  I went down there.  I had a good time.  But I've been to the Borgata.  You've got to go to Borgata.  I've been to the Borgata.  That's the only place to go now.  Borgata is like, when they opened that place, I went there, I was like, wow, somebody finally approximated Vegas here.  Right.  It feels like a Palms Hotel kind of thing. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Like a Maloof Brothers affair.  But I was on the boardwalk at Caesars, and I had a really shitty room with a huge generator outside the window, and they didn't give a shit.  And I'm like, I can't sleep with a noise going, eh, all night long.  And I questioned them.  I'm like, why would you give this room to anybody?  And they couldn't believe I was actually complaining.  I'm like, I never complain.  I never go on the front desk.  They don't pump any of their money back into the hotels over there on the boardwalk.  It's just a done deal.  They know whoever comes in, it's day trip people. 
[01:39:00]  They're not getting the high rollers that are flying in to be there.  They're day trip bus people that come in, so they don't give a shit.  And the whole place is one look away from a huge riot breaking out.  It really is.  You're walking around, everyone's hammered, but most people are very questionable to begin with.  I don't want to trash it.  One dirty look at your girl or something, and it's on.  I don't want to trash it because it's the homestay, but I thought I knew what a casino community was until I hit Vegas.  Then I was like, oh, my God. 
[01:39:30]  No, but see, this is nice here.  Yeah.  It's warm.  It's nice.  The people are fucking nice.  There's still like, if you're into the, you know, if you're into any kind of vice, there's a seedy element to it.  Yep.  But the seedy element out there is just, there's still kind of safe.  There's a safety to it.  The Atlantic City, the community around Atlantic City is kind of a little frightening.  Yeah, in Vegas, there's a peripheral economy that is thriving.  You know, you've got Vegas, and then you've got people that live and work in Vegas.  Right. 
[01:40:00]  In Atlantic City, you have the casinos, and people that don't work in the casinos, don't work anywhere, it doesn't look like.  Right.  They work you over.  They work you over, yeah.  You make a wrong turn around there somewhere, and you're like, oh, Jesus.  You have two choices, casinos, projects.  Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.  But what I brought up is the Bregada, you know, they built their place far away from all that, and I was wondering at the time, like, why would they do that?  They just don't want to be a part of that, and they want to start something new.  They want to start, like, a new Vegas.  When you're driving in, it's far from the Strip. 
[01:40:30]  It's far from everyone else.  Yeah, arena, whatever.  Yeah.  And I was telling these guys, and right around midnight, I mean, the casinos get infested with hookers.  Really?  It's not even a question.  I'm so not good at spotting hookers, man.  Yeah.  I'm not a good hooker spotter.  The only time I've ever spotted hookers was if you live in Los Angeles and you fly to Vegas, you usually fly out on Southwest out of the Burbank Airport, what they now call the Bob Hope Airport.  Yeah.  And it's very small, but, like, insanely convenient, better than going to LAX.  And you'll be on this flight to Vegas, and it'll be littered with gorgeous women. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, shit.  And you're sitting there going, wow, like, where are they?  Is there a convention?  And then you realize that it's the hookers, like, the high-priced call girls that work Los Angeles who go to Vegas for the weekend.  Wow.  Like, when you order them on the internet, they fly out there, and you're looking at them and going, why?  It's so suspicious.  There are so many good-looking women on this flight.  Here's a good way to tell if a girl's a hooker, and this is actually, this is a very, a very, if she's under 300 pounds and she's talking to me, she's probably being paid. 
[01:41:30]  Jimmy uses a lot, a lot of hookers.  Pros?  I've loved it a lot.  There's a logic to it, I think.  If I wasn't married, hookers would make a lot of sense to me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I've never, ever gotten a hooker, even, like, as a kid when, you know, especially growing up on Long Island, a lot of the guys would be like, hey, why don't we go into the city tonight?  And when the city was scary.  Right, right, right.  New York City was, like, really scary and stuff.  And just, like, was not even, I would not even think about doing it.  And then these guys like, Jimmy, that's just. 
[01:42:00]  The only involvement I've ever had with hookers was after I got married.  Really?  Yeah, with the wife.  The wife was like, let's bring a girl in.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, no, I kid you not.  Look at you.  Yeah.  You pulled that one off.  A couple of times.  I didn't, it wasn't even my idea, it was hers.  Which means I'm a terrible fucking lover, because she's like, let's bring a pro in.  But, uh, not a regular occurrence, but it's happened on more than one occasion.  And it's kind of fun and kind of weird and out there.  But there's something wonderfully convenient about, like, that's done, and there's no awkwardness, 
[01:42:30]  like, we have to see that person the next day, and like, oh, remember when we were all  doing weird things?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's interesting.  Thank God she doesn't listen to radio, the wife.  That is really something to pull off and not have to pay thousands of dollars every three  months.  She's a wonderful woman.  Wonderful woman, that wife of mine.  Yeah.  I gather.  And she's one of these chicks, like most chicks, who's very suspicious, like, I do a lot of  college gigs and stuff, go out and do Q&As, and she's just like, you know, I don't trust 
[01:43:00]  you going down the road.  I'm like, I don't want to fuck anybody else.  Like, you're fucking it, man.  Like, who could I possibly fuck who would offer me more than you do?  Not just, like, what we do one-on-one, but, like, whatever else comes into it later on.  Like, trust me, I am totally trustworthy.  Girls at the colleges kind of throw themselves at you.  I mean, but the thing is, if you look out at my audience, a bunch of dudes look like  me, you know?  If there's three chicks in the audience, I'd be surprised, you know?  Yeah.  I think we have the same audience. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, you know what I'm saying?  We do road shows and stuff.  We'll do it, like, we're doing St. Paddy's at the Hard Rock.  Right.  And it is just full of cocks.  Totally.  It's a sausage party.  Dicks all over the place.  I always whisper to Anthony, maybe we should be a little nicer on the radio.  Yeah.  Talk about stuff girls like.  Yeah, just a bit, so we can have something nice to look at.  We need to start talking about Juicy Clothing and Louis Vuitton, and maybe some broads  will show up.  And the latest movie on Lifetime.  Exactly.  The Opie and Anthony Road shows where a five is treated like a queen. 
[01:44:00]  Any chick there who might be a five who shows her tits.  The guy's like, you're fucking gorgeous.  You're terrific.  They love her.  At least you made Jersey Girl.  Come on.  That's true.  That was, like, endearing to the lady.  So there are some people out there who, some Lifetime audience watchers.  Right.  The older women who'd be like, oh, I like his movies, even though they've only seen that  one.  This weekend, a Lifetime movie premiere.  Jersey Girl.  I know you're going to see that.  That will play so well there.  Oh, it will.  So well there.  They'll love it.  Anytime the mom dies.  Sadly, didn't play well anyplace else. 
[01:44:30]  Lifetime.  Should have made it directly for a Lifetime.  Lifetime.  Starring Marky Post.  Just remember, like, when Lifetime first really kicked up, it was the same five people.  Valerie Bertinelli in a very special movie about a guy that she meets that's really cool.  Treats her great.  She's telling all her friends what a dream this guy is.  And he's got a deep, dark secret.  And it won't be long before she's just got two black eyes and he's pounding her in the 
[01:45:00]  face.  Wearing sunglasses.  Her friends are suspicious.  Yeah.  What happened?  Good night.  Oh, I fell down the stairs.  Mother, may I sleep with danger?  Next on Lifetime.  I just watched a Lifetime movie.  Bought it on DVD called Murder in the Hamptons.  And there's a chick on the show.  I've never seen this show without a trace.  Her name is Poppy Montgomery, I guess.  She's an actress.  And she was in this movie about this chick who married this rich guy.  And then it kind of fell for the contractor who was rebuilding their house. 
[01:45:30]  And then they conspired to kill the dude and kill them.  And she died of cancer.  But it was a total life.  A total life.  Yeah, total life.  You're sitting there going, what a hateful bitch.  And then she's dying of cancer.  You're like, I feel kind of bad.  But it's like you sit there going, the formula for the Lifetime movie is like women on top all the way across the board.  Oh, yeah.  Smart enough to fucking marry rich, smart enough to kill a husband off, and then poignant enough to die of cancer.  Right.  And there it is.  Perfect Lifetime movie.  And then the original programming is always the woman doctor, woman lawyer, very in control. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, there's a women's doctor show.  I forget what it's called.  But the chick who played Joe on Facts of Life is on the show.  Is on the show?  Yeah.  Great.  Nancy McCain.  Oh, she's powerful.  Is there a movie out there you haven't seen, Kevin?  Yeah, tons.  I mean, how about a movie that people would be surprised that you've never seen?  Because it's obvious that you have a crazy DVD collection.  I have never seen Casablanca to this day.  And people get outraged, you tell them that kind of thing.  Because you're supposed to do your whole movie history, but I've never seen Casablanca yet. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  Well, if you would have stayed in college, you probably would have seen that.  I probably would have seen it if I'd stuck around a little longer.  Instead of wasting your money making a movie.  I'm in that great time of year, it's just kind of coming to a close right now, where from October to like February, they send you every movie.  Every single movie ever made.  As a member of the Academy, they send you all the current movies.  So like, from October to February, I don't leave to go see a movie.  I just watch everything.  I'm like, I watch Brokeback at my house.  I watch Capote at my house.  Everything that's up for an Oscar, I saw it. 
[01:47:00]  You watch History of Violence?  History of Violence.  Loved it.  That was great.  That was my favorite movie.  Yeah, that was in my top.  I think I had it in my top ten or just missed the top ten.  But I thought that was great.  Total surprise.  I had no idea what it was.  Yep.  I thought the name of the movie fucked it up a little bit.  Because you almost think, what is this, a documentary or something?  Right.  It's a great movie.  He was good.  He was fantastic.  I could always watch Maria Bella.  I think she's a really cool actress.  Right on.  And she has zero compunction about taking her gear off, too.  Yeah, no kidding.  Some of the sex things in that movie were pretty crazy. 
[01:47:30]  Pretty hot when they fuck on the staircase.  Yeah.  It's like, right on, man.  Married a couple of fuckers.  You see in The Company of Men, there's a great film about some deaf girl that works in  this company.  And the two guys are, I think betting is who can fuck her first.  Right.  It's something along those lines.  Aaron Eckhart, and the bet is whether they can make her fall in love with her and dump  her.  Like, just to be hurtful.  Yeah.  He was really mean-spirited.  One of the guys falls in love with her.  He'll be great.  It was a couple of years ago.  The guy that did, he did Nurse Betty a few years after that.  And he did this, he's a playwright, but he directed this movie. 
[01:48:00]  Great movie.  Angry, angry film.  Yeah.  Like, really great.  No one movie I'm surprised didn't get more of a buzz was Murderball.  Yeah.  Murderball had such pre-release hype.  Like, from Sundance to the moment they released it, tons of coverage and tons of, like, if  you go, like, here it's the Village Voice, but in every city they got a Village Voice type  paper, like a kind of counterculture paper that comes out on a weekly basis.  Their weeklies, it would be the cover of a weekly in every city I'd been to right before  it came out.  Then it came out and just a lot of people didn't wind up going to see it. 
[01:48:30]  And now the DVD just came out with not much of a buzz.  It's a, I'd love that movie.  It's a totally good movie, but you sit there going, wow, man, I guess, I guess they're  angry.  Yeah.  They're really angry to be in those wheelchairs.  Good way to channel their anger here.  Wheelchair rugby, who knew?  Yeah.  You get a, you get a lot of people, um, emailing you like, hey, I made this on iMovie.  Take a look at it.  Yeah, but I, I get a lot, what I get a lot of is people hand me things.  If I go to comic book shows or Q&As, they'll hand me DVDs of their movies.  You ever see anything that was, like, getting a chuckle or. 
[01:49:00]  Back in the day, I used to actually watch them.  We'd kick back with the friends and we'd watch them.  And every once in a while, you discover a real gem.  And when I say gem, I don't mean, like, wow, I'd back this.  Right.  It's just so bad.  It's good.  Yeah, yeah.  Um, where you want to get involved in the lives of the people that made it and whatnot.  Like, cause they'll give you these elaborate fucking press kits in history where you can  follow their whole story of what led them to making this.  And there was one that we saw, it was like a movie made by this married couple.  And I think they were in Canada and it was a movie about, um, he was an assassin and, 
[01:49:30]  and, but the dude looked like he was 12 years old and his wife's in the movie too.  Everything is always so bad.  Well, they cast themselves, you know, they cast themselves, they work with what they  have.  And, um, the movie was just so over the top bad that we wanted to call them and get  involved in their lives and see what, how, what led to this and why they think that this  will lead to other things.  Yeah.  Forget the name of the movie, but that was the last one I actually watched.  And that was back in like, uh, 98, 99, 2000.  I've seen some, uh, like star Wars fan films that they make that are just the most elaborate 
[01:50:00]  things that, uh, costuming and CGI work.  There's that one.  What is that one?  And I, I look to you, Kev, cause I'm, I assume that you would know the one that they, they  made that's online.  Duality.  Is it duality?  Duality is the shorter one.  Then there's one called revelation.  Revelations.  I should have looked to fucking you.  Just like the guy went all out with this thing.  Revelations I've heard a lot about.  Some of the CGI work was amazing, amazing on it that they're doing them on their max. 
[01:50:30]  And then you would imagine that this would lead to another gig of some sort, but you  don't hear the follow-up story.  Like there was that dude who did that Batman dead end short.  Sandy cholera.  That looked great.  What was that about?  It was a short where he did a Batman who like, rather than the Batman they do in the  movies where the dude's wearing like the hard armor and whatnot, he wore a Batman costume  that kind of looked like the Alex Ross type Batman, like Batman in tights.  But it's like this fan geek-gasm picture where it's only about 15, maybe 10, 15 minutes  long.  But first there's Batman battling the Joker. 
[01:51:00]  Then...  And who played the Joker in that?  Then...  Boner from Growing Pains.  Boner from Growing Pains.  Really?  And you couldn't even tell that was him.  Wow.  With the makeup on.  Then they introduce Predator into the film.  Like the Predator.  Then they introduce fucking aliens into the film.  So you're sitting there going, it just keeps getting better.  Like, what's next?  And it's just Batman battling fucking like the Joker who gets killed by a fucking Predator  or an alien first.  And then Batman battling the alien. 
[01:51:30]  Then the alien shows up to battle fucking Predator.  And Batman's got to battle the alien and the Predator.  Astounding.  You're sitting there going like, God, this is what it would be like if there were no  corporations and you could just do whatever you wanted.  It looked great.  It looked fantastic.  Yeah.  Dude did a great fucking job.  Yeah.  Do you hear of a film called White Chicks Incorporated?  Mm-mm.  It's arguably the worst film ever done.  starring Jim Florentine, Artie Lang, myself, and Rich Voss.  And it could be the worst thing ever put on film.  Really?  Do you do a spit take in it? 
[01:52:00]  No, I don't do a spit take in it.  That's the criteria for the worst film ever made?  Oh, I love Jimmy's spit takes.  He's the best at it.  I've got to tell you, Kevin.  I've done a couple of spit takes that are actually very good.  But in this one, I play a celebrity comedian and it's so, I get the douche chill thinking  about that I actually got up early and said, I'm going to do a movie.  Like, I felt like I'm going to do a movie and I'm awful and everyone else is awful.  We all have that one piece of secret shame somewhere in our resume.  You have clerks predated stuff, predating clerks?  No, clerks, first thing I ever did. 
[01:52:30]  It was the first camera you picked up?  Not even an eight millimeter?  Well, I mean, technically, when I was in, I did four months at a film school in Vancouver,  First Columbia, and we did this little short.  It's on that clerk's disc called May Day.  And it was supposed to be a documentary about a tranny, a pre-op transsexual.  And we shot her performing, but then she wouldn't do the interview.  Yeah, it just didn't come together.  So then we turned it into a documentary about how our documentary fell apart, called it May Day instead.  Did she ever get to the operation?  She did.  And then when I did that, that dude called up about that Vancouver show. 
[01:53:00]  When I was at the Vancouver show, she showed up.  She was at the show and she had gone through with it and got the dick cut off and whatnot.  And it was, I hadn't seen this woman until, or this guy who is now a woman in like 11, 10, 11 years at that point.  It was kind of strange.  I never know what to call them.  Yeah.  Well, at this point, I guess she's a total she, but then she wasn't.  I mean, Vancouver, back in the day, man, Vancouver, when I was going to film school there in 92,  hooker fucking hooker land.  Yes.  Like tons and tons of prostitutes.  I'd walk to school in the morning and you would know these were fucking prostitutes because 
[01:53:30]  they would solicit you.  Tons of hookers.  And then I spent the last three months in the summer up in Vancouver again because I  was working on this movie, acting in this movie called Catch and Release with Jennifer  Garner.  And now the hookers are gone and it's all about fucking crystal meth.  Like there's a lot of fucking spun people on the streets.  Yeah, it's kind of sad.  It's weird.  You go out to eat at a restaurant and I'd pull up to the steakhouse they had there called  Gotham and I was eating there quite a bit. 
[01:54:00]  And you'd get out and you would see people doing deals right there on the street.  Like I saw some dudes and they all look like they just got the shit beat out of them for  some reason.  Yeah.  Like they're all scarred up and whatnot.  For some reason, yeah.  Crystal meth kind of chews you up.  It really chews you up.  And they approach each other in this kind of awkward fashion.  And one dude will grab something out of his mouth and put it into the mouth of the other  dude.  And that was their handoff.  That was their deal.  It was nuts.  I'd never seen anything like it before.  And I'd been around fucking...  Spiff his hand, rip his pants down.  You know?  Basically a total broke down affair.  I got blown in an alley in Vancouver.  I went there to a sober event in 1990. 
[01:54:30]  I was like three years sober with a bunch of sober people.  We went up to like to see the gardens in Canada.  And I had like a hundred American dollars left.  And I spent 80 of it being blown by some girl.  Me and my buddy got blown.  She just bent over and fucking blew us.  And I gave my last 20 to another girl who like helped her and let me pat her on the  bum.  And...  While it was going on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I got blown by two hookers in an alley.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was great.  And that was my Vancouver experience.  Clean alleys though.  Clean alleys in Vancouver.  I remember nothing about Vancouver except a head going up and down and me handing over 
[01:55:00]  cash.  It fucking...  It could have happened anywhere.  I just remember...  It could have been any city, USA or Canada.  Yeah, she was just like, you know, don't come in my mouth, eh?  That's all I remember.  Let's go to Pat on the phones here.  Pat, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  We're having a good time with Kevin Smith.  Yeah, man.  Huge, huge fan.  I'm one of those suckers who bought three copies of Clerks.  Right on, sir.  One pen and the original.  Right on.  Thank you.  I got two questions.  One question's been really, really bugging me for a long time.  On an evening with Kevin Smith, you were interrupted where they shut down your show. 
[01:55:30]  Yes.  On the end of the first disc, they shut us down in Indiana.  And what happened there?  That was it.  They literally shut us down.  Like, basically, they used it as a framing device on the DVD to get to disc two.  But when that dude came out and shut us down, that was it.  They were just like, they were not prepared.  I tend to do these Q&As that go on for a very long time.  Yeah, yeah.  And the shortest one that I've done in the last few years, about four hours, and the 
[01:56:00]  longest was eight hours.  Oh, my God.  So we're in Indiana.  And that's the thing.  I mean, I don't know if it's the same for you guys.  But you go out on the fucking road, and it's like, once you're in a place, I'm married.  It's not like I'm going to go out there trolling for pussy or something like that.  I might as well stay on stage all fucking night.  Because I'm just thinking about the flight home at that point.  So I'm like, if I can make it till...  If I can kill all my time there and grab a few hours of sleep, get on a fucking plane,  I'm good to go.  But other than, if I get off the stage after two hours, three hours, I'm like, what am  I going to do in fucking Indiana?  Yeah, exactly.  I might as well be up here and shit.  So I tend to go on for a very long time. 
[01:56:30]  In Indiana, I think we had hit the four-hour mark.  And they were like, well, we've got to shut this place down.  We've got things to do, and you can't just sit here talking all night.  So they closed down into that.  And people got outraged.  Like, the audience was kind of pissed off.  It was like an audience of 3,000 people.  And sometimes they go.  Like, if you're going on, you hit the four-hour mark, basically.  At that point, half of your audience starts going, well, I've seen enough.  I'm going home.  You know, what more could he possibly answer?  And then you get the rest of them sticking behind going, who do you like better, Batman or Superman?  Like, they'll just pull fucking questions just to keep you standing there. 
[01:57:00]  But this audience had really stayed.  And being that it was fucking Indiana, I guess there was nothing else to do.  So they were all there.  And they would have stayed if I'd gone on for another two, three hours and shit.  But they shut the hall down, and they got kind of outraged and whatnot.  It was not a pretty affair.  Nico!  Yo, what's up, man?  What's up?  Hey, sorry my voice sucks, man.  I sound like a kid-toucher.  But I got a question for Kevin Smith, man.  I'm a big fan, and I'm black, which should really surprise you.  That's rare, Sarah. 
[01:57:30]  That's rare.  When you made Jersey Girl, there was a lot of shit going on around the Internet about how you wanted to get away from, like, the Jay and Silent Bob characters.  Right.  What made you go back and do Clerks 2?  And I got a second question for you after that.  Okay, there were a few things.  I mean, at that point, I wanted to get away from Jay and Silent Bob because Jason Mewes was so deeply into heroin and Oxycontin.  It was just not fun to do things anymore. 
[01:58:00]  Like, at the tail end of the Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back shoot, we were in Jersey for, like, the last three days of that shoot.  And I swear to you, we wrapped on the shot, the last shot involving Jay.  He went to his fucking trailer.  I went to see him ten minutes later because the Middletown cops were like, can we take a picture with you guys?  I said, yeah, let me go get Jason.  And Jason had just went and buried himself in a pile of fucking heroin.  And he immediately, it was like night and day.  His appearance could demeanor completely fucking change.  And he spent the next fucking three weeks just going on a serious bender. 
[01:58:30]  I went back to Los Angeles to cut the movie, came back out to the East Coast in July to shoot a music video with him.  Showed up at the place he was living in Kingsburg at that point.  And I hadn't seen him in, at this point, two, three months.  So I'm waiting outside.  His sister was outside.  She's like, I'll go get him.  And she goes into the house.  And then this real skinny, skeletal, long-haired, Jason-looking dude came out of the house.  And I was like, wow, man, he, Mewes is hanging out with crackheads that look like Mewes now.  And then that crackhead got in my fucking car. 
[01:59:00]  And it was Jason.  And he had dropped like 40 pounds over the course of two months because he was doing some crack at that point.  And it was heartbreaking.  I was just in, I broke down and started crying.  And I was just like, dude, I can't do this anymore.  I can't, I can't watch you throw your fucking life away.  And I tried to help this dude.  Would bring him in, go cold turkey in my fucking house.  Like, I would give up months at a time and just sit on Jason, just babysit Jason.  It was this whole period where I would take him to the, what was that, methadone clinic every morning in Asbury Park and shit.  And like our day was structured around the meth clinic.  We'd get up at six in the morning, fucking drive to the meth clinic. 
[01:59:30]  He'd bang his fucking meth.  And then we'd go to fucking Dunkin' Donuts and he'd get a manager special where they put fucking sprinkles on it and shit like that.  Then we would go out looking for 12-inch Greedo dolls at Toys R Us when they first started doing those 12-inch Star Wars dolls.  And Greedo was hard to find.  So we'd go to all these Toys R Uses in the fucking greater New Jersey area.  Just constantly keeping him distracted.  And every day was spent, like, coming up with a program to keep that dude from thinking about fucking heroin.  So it just got to be too much at that point. 
[02:00:00]  And finally there was a rehab counselor who was like, look, you're not helping him.  Like, you keep throwing a net out for this guy.  Like, he needs to hit rock bottom.  And I was like, well, what if his rock bottom is him dead?  He's dead.  Death, right.  And he's going, you can't do anything about that.  If he's going to die, he's going to die.  And I was like, this is my friend.  And he's like, you can't, don't you understand?  Like, you're not helping this dude.  He's like, you need to really step off.  You need to step back.  You need to not throw a net out for him.  You need to hit him with some hardcore tough love.  Like, don't let him in your house.  Don't let him see your kid because they have a real tight relationship with my daughter and whatnot. 
[02:00:30]  So that kind of led to the whole, like, all right, I'm not going to do any view of skew flicks anymore.  And also at the same time, I was like, I'd like to try one that has nothing to do with the other movies.  One that really stands alone by itself.  So that led to that.  When Jason cleaned up, I mean, some people are like, well, obviously Jersey Girl didn't work, so he wants to do Clerks 2.  And they've kind of missed the target but hit the tree.  It wasn't indicative of me going, oh, fucking nobody wanted to see Jersey Girl, so I better go back to the well.  Like, if I was going to do a safe movie, it would have been The Green Hornet.  Like, a movie that, like, had a big budget. 
[02:01:00]  I get a huge fucking payday on.  You know they'd spend a bunch of money marketing it to make it work.  That's a safer bet than going back and doing Clerks 2, which we made for, like, you know, very little money.  And it doesn't have a bunch of people that love it on video don't mean they're going to go out and see it.  Like, if the movie wound up making $25 to $30 million theatrically, I'd be fucking shocked.  And that would be great because we didn't spend that much to make it.  But that's not, like, a safe bet movie.  And the Jersey Girl part of it, of the equation, wasn't because it didn't work, so shit, I'm going to go back to something that I know works. 
[02:01:30]  It was more like the experience of making a movie where you don't have as much power as the fucking stars of the film was really disenchanting.  And it's not like Affleck was an asshole or Jennifer Lopez was an asshole about it.  But their relationship seriously affected our ability to open and market that movie.  And there are some people on the Internet who are like, oh, fuck you, the movie just sucked.  And it's like, look, maybe the movie sucks, in your opinion, but you can't be blind to the fact that it was an insane challenge, an uphill battle to release that movie in a post-Gilie climate. 
[02:02:00]  That was the worst timing, yeah.  Oh, bad.  The Gilie and the fact that they were...  What does Gilie mean?  What does that mean?  That was the movie they made.  That was the movie they made, that movie Gilie that came out.  It wound up coming off like...  It was like, hey, remember that movie you hated so much came out a few months ago with those two people you can't stand?  Man, here's a second helping.  Here they are.  And it was nothing but...  I mean, the news, I'm sure you remember, that's all it was.  Sir, I just watched that channel unfold and I was just like, oh, my God, this is it. 
[02:02:30]  It's all over.  And amazingly, we were able to make it.  Like, that movie cost them $70 million to make, Gilie, and they made $6 million.  It would stand to reason that Jersey Girl following Gilie would make less than $6 million.  Somehow we were able to get to $25 million, but when he spent $35 million to make it, you're still...  That's a disappointment.  There's still a $10 million fucking loss there, which DVD takes care of, but still, it hurt.  And so for me, I was like, I don't want to work with fucking famous people right now in my life. 
[02:03:00]  And not so much...  And again, not because they were dicks or something, but it's just like their relationship, I have no control over.  I have no control over how people reacted to their relationship, but it adversely affects my movie.  And it's just like, I want to make a movie with people who in the whole world don't see every day on fucking InTouch Weekly's cover and know so much about their relationship, but they can't divorce themselves from their public persona and get lost in a movie and shit like that.  I was like, look, as long as Brian O'Hallor and Jeff Anderson don't fall in love and get married, I'm fine on the next movie. 
[02:03:30]  Do you think Ben Affleck, because I loved him in a lot of the earlier stuff, and now I'm kind of sick of watching him, with the exception, of course, of Reindeer Games.  I mean, who couldn't enjoy a film titled Reindeer Games?  Wow.  Do you kind of notice that he's done a lot of not-as-good films lately?  There was a period where he was saying yes to a lot of things that he probably should have thought a little bit more about.  But, like, Paycheck comes to mind, like, the very appropriately titled Paycheck, you know? 
[02:04:00]  Just kind of like, but to be fair, it's like, as a script, I think it kind of worked, but once they put John, and then you see, like, you got a script that you like.  Like, I remember we were shooting Jersey Girl, and Matt came in for a few days to do it, and Matt, I was at this dinner with Ben and Matt, where Matt was like, I just read this chick, this flick called Paycheck.  Like, he's like, which I can't, I loved it, I can't do it because it's too close to the Bourne identity.  He's going, but I think you should read it, and then Ben read it, and Ben wound up doing the movie. 
[02:04:30]  And you like the script, and you're sitting there going, wow, that's a pretty good idea.  And then you hear that John Woo's attaching, like, John Woo's made some pretty fucking badass movies.  Yeah.  And then somehow it doesn't all gel together, and the movie just turns out kind of poorly and whatnot.  And I think that happened to him a few times in a row.  So, like, the movie he did, Surviving Christmas, you know, he's got James Gandolfini in the flick.  You're sitting there going, I'm going to work with Tony Soprano.  I get to do a comedy, like a comedy I've never done before, like, real over-the-top broad kind of Jim Carrey-type performance and shit. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, it's got to be hard just reading a script, looking at who's in it, and then going, oh, I know this is going to tank.  Right, yeah.  Like, nobody does that.  It's got all the good ingredients.  Nobody sits there going, like, I'm just doing this for the money.  Like, everyone thinks that, you know, hopes for the best.  That's going to be the next huge movie, right?  Yeah, totally.  John Woo, has he done a good movie in English, though?  I like all of his Chinese stuff.  I don't like any of his stuff that he's done here.  I mean, I thought Face Off was watchable in a real kind of campy way.  But I'm not, I don't know.  I hated his Mission Impossible 2.  I thought it was so fucking terrible. 
[02:05:30]  Because I liked that first one a lot.  And Mission Impossible 2 was just like, what's going on?  A lot of doves in this picture.  You know, he's got a lot of birds in all his movies.  All his movies.  It's just so strange.  But, you know, it's weird.  It's just like, you go on good runs and bad runs.  Like, Matt's been on a really good run lately.  He's picked projects that have really kind of fucking panned out for him.  And Ben was on this run where he just hit like two or three bad ones in a row.  How rough is that for those two, though?  Because they'll always be compared to each other. 
[02:06:00]  To one another.  With their work because of the way they got into things.  I mean, thankfully, they're good friends.  So they were able to keep that shit in perspective.  I mean, I guess the key is to just not read a lot of that shit.  Like, Affleck just didn't read a lot of that shit that was going on at that time.  Because they were slamming them every day.  But that isn't even reading.  That's walking down the fucking street, man.  And turning and looking at a magazine rack or something.  Totally.  I think you become inured at that point.  When you're used to seeing your face on magazine covers all the time.  Like, during that period of his relationship with Jennifer Lopez. 
[02:06:30]  They were on the cover of fucking Us Weekly.  It felt like every week.  And I think at a certain point, you're just like.  Just get numb to it?  Yeah, you're just numb to it.  I think people just got sick of him.  Like, everybody else get a little overexposed.  People are like, ugh, all right.  And he's actually a good actor.  But I mean, I like that.  He's a good actor and he's a funny dude, too.  Like, he's a really fucking sharp, funny dude and whatnot.  And he got a bad rap over the last, like, two years.  And he's been laying low for at least the last year and whatnot.  And next flick he's got coming out is this movie. 
[02:07:00]  They were calling it Truth, Justice, and the American Way.  Now it's called Hollywoodland.  It's about George Reeves, the guy that played Superman,  who was either killed or killed himself.  They never really knew that.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's supposedly a pretty good flick, and he's really good in it.  Wait, what's the film before Jersey Girl?  I have to know.  I have to see this now with Jennifer and Ben.  Oh, Gigli?  It's called Gigli.  How do you spell that?  G-I-G-L-I.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  I find it shocking and surprising that you didn't know that movie.  Oh, he knows nothing about pop culture. 
[02:07:30]  It's such a part of the national consciousness.  Yeah, Gigli was, yeah.  Jimmy's the worst.  The way that Ishtar was bitch slapped and the way that Waterworld and Heaven's Gate,  like, Gigli redefined it.  Gigli made, like, Mariah Carey's going, finally, we're going to stop talking about glitter.  Because Gigli really fucking took the torch and ran.  What was it about, I mean, roughly, in a nutshell?  It was about a hitman who converts a lesbian.  Wow, I mean, how did that not work?  Kevin, what was the worst film you saw? 
[02:08:00]  Worst film I've ever seen?  I would give it up to The Flintstones, the only movie I think I've ever walked out of.  I was 20 minutes into that movie, and I was like, this is terrible.  Wow.  Not a controversial choice.  No.  But that's the one.  I walked out of it.  I walked out of it.  It's fucking terrible.  I walked out of a movie, a guy, it was so long ago, I think it was called Ruby.  With Danny Aiello?  I don't even know who it was.  About Jack Ruby?  No, no, it was some kind of murder woman thing.  It came out the same time I think Carrie was out.  Wow, you're just going far back. 
[02:08:30]  Late 70s or something like that.  I walked out of Elizabethtown recently.  Did you really?  Yeah, my friend Scott Mosher watched it, and he was just like, dude, you have to, and I  love, it's Cameron Crowe, normally he knocks it out of the park, but Scott was just like,  you gotta watch this movie for the opening fucking 20 minutes, he's going, just to watch  like an actor not fucking fitting that material.  No, not at all.  He thought Orlando Bloom was incredibly miscast.  I hate the people that just take you right out of movies, but I walked out of that.  I was snoring so loud, and I never fall asleep in the movie theater. 
[02:09:00]  I'm snoring so loud.  I got the old elbow, and I'm like, all right, let's get the hell out of here.  It was a packed theater, it just opened up as a Friday night, it was the only movie that  looked like it might be something.  It was the worst writing ever, I think.  Yeah, Cameron Crowe, I mean, how could you go wrong with Cameron Crowe?  I walked out of Mission Impossible 2 before it started.  Did you?  Yeah, it was a Puerto Rican family in front that was making noise, and my girlfriend  told him to shut the fuck up, and I had to leave.  Yeah, you were like, we're out of here.  Hey, by the way, Nico has his follow-up question still. 
[02:09:30]  Nico, didn't you have a second question?  I still didn't even finish the other one.  Long and short of it is that basically Muse got clean.  How did he end up getting clean?  What was the thing that said, all right, look?  He, you know, for years we'd put him into rehabs, like we put him into this rehab called Promises  out in Malibu, and that was during the Jay and Silent Bob press tour, because we brought  him out to, after I discovered him when I went to his house and he was fucking bone thin  and shit, I took him with me back to Los Angeles, because we were doing the press junket for 
[02:10:00]  Jay and Silent Bob strike back.  How did you get him back to, this is a weird question, but how did you get him back to  L.A.?  Just put him on a plane, brought him with me.  Was everyone just staring at him like, holy shit.  I mean, but most people, it's not like he's insanely well-known where people are like,  hey, that dude looks different than I'm used to seeing him.  Some people, you know, people involved with the flick were like, what the fuck happened  to him?  But while he was, we were staying at the W Hotel in Westwood, and, you know, I was just  like, dude, you got it, we're giving up the drugs, and we're going to go rehab, and he  was like, right, right, right, I'm going to stay clean now. 
[02:10:30]  But, you know, when you're in that mindset, you just lie.  He was having heroin FedExed to the hotel.  His sister was FedExing fucking heroin to the hotel, and the hotel found out and called  the fucking police.  So at that point, I was like, dude, you have to go into fucking rehab.  Why would the sister do that?  I mean, kind of a dumb question, probably, but.  Was she afraid he'd get bad?  That's codependent behavior, obviously.  Was she afraid he'd get bad stuff on the street?  She also had a problem with drugs, too.  I mean, it was a bad situation all around, and they would alternate between heroin and 
[02:11:00]  Oxycontin and whatnot.  So finally, I was able to kind of use that moment to be like, dude, you're going into  rehab.  Like, I'd been able to use another moment a few years earlier when he borrowed my ATM card  one night.  He was like, hey, dude, I got here, a cab dropped me off, and I don't have any money, and it was  like two in the morning.  We were at this hotel in Los Angeles, so I was like, dude, I'm sleeping.  I don't have any cash on me, but here's my ATM card.  Go take out 50 bucks.  Wow.  Pay the cab guy.  Just give me my ATM card in the morning.  Can we guess how much?  Take a shot in the door.  $4,000 cab ride? 
[02:11:30]  It was over the course of, that was two in the morning and 11 o'clock when I finally  figured it out.  So nine hours he had it for?  So nine hours he had it for.  I would say five grand.  Apparently, you can't take that much.  Well, that's the only reason, because I'm thinking he's going for it.  But they always tell, like every time I go to take money out of the ATM, they tell me  like 400, that's it.  You've exceeded your limit.  He was able to take $1,000 off of my fucking ATM card.  And I was like, how can this dude do it?  I can't get more than 400 bucks out of my fucking ATM card over the course of 24 hours. 
[02:12:00]  So at that point, I was able to be like, dude, that's grand fucking theft.  I'm going to stick you in rehab.  You got to go or else I'm going to turn you over to the cops.  He went to rehab, got clean, stayed clean a little while, eventually got back to drugs.  This time, after the junket thing, we put him in a rehab in Malibu called Promises.  Real plush and shit.  Like me and Jen went to visit him.  And Jen was like, fuck it.  I'm an alcoholic.  Stick me in here.  You know, they were in this beautiful house overlooking the water.  The waves roll in under the house itself.  Really gorgeous place.  He was there for about a month. 
[02:12:30]  And he was allowed to go out on passes and whatnot with a sober living escort.  And he went out to see a movie.  He came back.  And they were like, people that run the place were like, we need to talk to you.  And there's somebody checking in here who you know.  And Muse is like, trust me, nobody I know would be in this place.  And they're like, there is somebody that you know.  And you're not allowed to talk about it to anybody.  You can't, especially can't tell Kevin at this point.  And they were like, he was like, what are you talking about?  Who is it?  And they opened the door and it was fucking Ben.  Because remember Ben went into rehab?  Also right before September 11th and stuff. 
[02:13:00]  And then everyone forgot about that.  That was like the cover of all the fucking rags for a while.  And then September 11th, I haven't nobody fucking remember that.  So Ben and Muse were in rehab for a little while.  Ben was in for booze and Muse was in for really harder stuff.  So they spent a lot of time in that rehab together.  Muse got out, stayed clean for about four months, and then went back on it.  But meanwhile, telling everybody that it was clean.  So we believed he had been clean for a good year before we caught on to the fact that he wasn't.  So it went like that for a long time.  And then he got busted in New Jersey. 
[02:13:30]  There was a warrant out for his arrest.  He was trying to stay out of New Jersey.  And then finally he went back to Jersey to deal with the warrant.  And they said, okay, you get rehab or one year in jail.  And he chose.  It was a tough choice for him.  But he chose the six months in rehab.  And for some reason, that rehab, the most non-plush rehab, the fucking down and dirty, you know, state-run rehab, was the one that clicked.  And just worked for him.  And he just got to this point.  He's like, he'd been saying for years, if I'm 30 years old and still living this way, I just want to put a fucking gun in my mouth because I can't stand this. 
[02:14:00]  And for years, he'd also said, like, if I could get a warehouse full of Oxycontin and never have to worry about where to get my drugs again, I promise you I would never get clean.  He's going, the worst part about this is trying to figure out where to find the drugs.  But with this rehab, he had just hit this wall where he's just like, we don't hang out anymore.  You know, you don't let me see the fucking kid.  I understand all that.  He's going, I'm just tired of living this way, so I'm going to try to live in a different way for a while.  And that was three years ago.  And he's been really fucking successful at it. 
[02:14:30]  Came out of rehab.  He did six months in Jersey.  Moved back out to Los Angeles.  Been living with me ever since.  Took to a steady diet of Red Bull.  Like, that's yet another product that they need to advertise is like, if you used to love junk, this is the product for you.  Because that dude drinks Red Bull like it's fucking going out of style.  I watched that dude bang ten fucking Red Bulls in the span of a half an hour.  I'm like, how does your heart not explode?  He's like, dude, I used to do tons of heroin.  I'm like, yeah, good point.  So he's been able to stay clean.  So that made it easier to think about, like, hey, maybe we can do another film with Jane, Silent Bob. 
[02:15:00]  And also, I was working on that Clerks 10 DVD.  And I fell in love with the characters again.  And I was just like, boy, I really want to make a movie about what I feel like it's like to be in my 30s.  Because Clerks was a movie about what it felt like to be in my 20s.  So I was like, maybe I'll use Dante and Randall to tell that story.  It came after Jersey Girl.  So it was like, yeah, I would like to work with Brian and Jeff, who are incredibly low maintenance compared to the cast I just worked with.  So everything just kind of clicked that way.  Thanks for being so open, by the way.  We get a lot of, you know, big names in here.  It's like, they don't tell the shit. 
[02:15:30]  They don't tell the stories.  And then they got publicists outside the studio, like, getting all nervous and stuff that we might ask.  It's always more interesting.  Yeah, that we might ask that question.  Oh, my God.  God forbid we ask the question.  Hey, Nico, what's the follow-up?  That was the 20-minute answer to the front.  Sorry about that.  That was a long, long answer.  It was still interesting as well.  Who are you, kid?  Go ahead, Nico.  A comment real quick, man.  The best line from one of your movies was in Mallrats where they get the breakup letter. 
[02:16:00]  And she's like, yeah, she calls you callow in here.  Right.  And you mentioned that it means fragile and weak-willed.  Right.  Yeah, I've actually been called callow.  So that was the thing that just made me die laughing in that fucking movie.  That's such a great word, callow.  But also, on Silent Bob Talks, An Evening with Silent Bob, you actually told the story about the first time you fucked your wife.  Yes.  Very long story.  Did you tell that again?  You know what? 
[02:16:30]  We don't want to monopolize the show with that shit.  But if anyone's interested in hearing the story about the first time I fucked my wife, fine, rent, go to Netflix, whatever, buy, Evening with Kevin Smith.  It's a very long story.  There are great stories on those things that are, yeah, long form.  Very long.  And one of my favorites was the one with the Wild West.  The Superman story with John Peters.  Unbelievably funny.  Crazy true story, man.  Crazy true story.  Yeah, you've got to check it out.  Hey, can we go take more leaks?  Ooh.  Want to take another leak?  Took a lot of water today for some reason. 
[02:17:00]  And you need a cigarette problem.  I got an iron bladder.  Smoke break for me.  We already told everyone that you're outside smoking in between breaks, so don't be surprised  if a few people walk by to take a picture.  There were people looking at me a little suspiciously out there.  Well, I thought it was probably odd to see you in a long coat leaning against the wall smoking  a cigarette.  You know, what's next?  A groucho walking down the sidewalk with a cigar.  This is my wife.  She's just like, why do you wear that coat?  She's like, it instantly identifies you.  It's like, this is the only coat I have that fits me. 
[02:17:30]  Like, this fits me well.  And I was stupid enough to wear it in the movie once, so it became that fucking coat.  But I ain't ready to give it up as my coat, too.  It's not your movie coat that you wear outside.  It's what you wear.  It's what I wore.  And I just happened to wear it in a movie once.  But yeah, I should just get a new coat.  But I like this one.  You know, I paid 10 bucks for this coat.  I don't know if you guys remember, in the malls, they used to have these stores called  the Oak Tree.  Oh, shit.  It's kind of urban clothes for white dudes.  I remember Oak Tree.  Yeah, and I bought it in the middle of the summer, back in, I think, 89, 90, maybe 91, 
[02:18:00]  the latest.  In the middle of the summer, it was on a fucking sale rack for 10 bucks.  And I said, this coat will fucking come in handy.  10 bucks?  I'll buy it.  And it's fucking lasted me like this fucking long.  I missed that store, man.  That was when I used to wear mustard-colored clothing, a lot of purples, upscale urban clothing.  Now it's like it's pants down.  You see your ass cracker.  You're wearing backwards and shit like that, but back then, it was like if you were a white  guy and you wanted to dress black, you wore a lot of purple and a lot of mustard-colored 
[02:18:30]  vests.  And I had a lot of that shit.  Is Ocean Pacific still popular when I was younger?  O.P. was the-  O.P.'s back, man.  O.P.'s still around.  So is Iza.  Coming back, yeah.  Yeah, Iza too.  All right.  We'll talk more after the break, all right?  Yeah.  Hey, closing ceremonies of the Olympics.  Oh, really?  It's over?  Yeah, Olympics are finally over.  Thank God.  Most people just didn't give a shit.  We'll be back with that.  Curling, O.P.?  Well, we like the curling.  Opinion on the Olympics, maybe, and you watch any of the good old Celeb Reality?  No, I can't stand that reality TV. 
[02:19:00]  I can't get enough of this dumb shit.  What are you watching, the dancing show or the skating show?  No, I got hooked on the skating show, and it's god-awful.  It sucks.  We're doing American Idol.  I do Flavor of Love.  I do Celebrity Fit Club.  Did you-  The trash show, the better.  Have you watched the skating one?  Yeah.  I just read that story about how the chick who played Buffy, what's her name?  Christy Swanson.  Yeah.  It's like, it's now fucking the dude who she was, that's her partner?  It's the greatest story ever, because they hook up with this dumb celebrity, you know,  skating with celebrities. 
[02:19:30]  And the skating guy who's won all sorts of shit in real skating events-  Won a couple bronzes.  Yeah.  He left his wife, who's eight months pregnant.  No.  She had a kid.  Yeah, he left her, and a month later, she had the fucking kid by herself.  Right.  Their second child.  Their second child.  For Christy Swanson, for the OG Buffy.  Right, that's right.  OG Buffy.  Said, fuck this.  But it was so sad.  Like, this dude, the karma this dude's got, like, behind him now is a fucking horrible-  Oh.  And there's no way he could possibly win at this point.  Like, who's going to vote for those people?  The homewrecker and the fucking dude who would leave his pregnant wife? 
[02:20:00]  Well, I would.  It was-  Awful, Jimmy.  He would.  The show was fun to watch, because Bruce Jenner was so god-awful on skates.  We joked, you look like, you know, Frankenstein or Herman Munster or something.  It looks like he's had some work done, right?  Oh, yeah.  Something's going on there, because his nose got small.  He's got a white Michael Jackson thing going on.  Yeah, he's all pulled back, skin on his face and everything.  And the greatest show ever, and it's getting huge ratings, is Flavor of Love.  What is that?  It's Flavor Flav in a mansion.  Oh, that's the Flavor show? 
[02:20:30]  Trying to find his latest chick.  Right.  And they're all vying for his attention, and they're all just ghetto chicks from the projects.  It's hilarious.  And they bring him into a mansion, and-  Yeah, and he votes girls off every week.  And he's having sex with some of them, and it's just, it's so trashy.  It's great.  Phenomenal.  It's amazing, the celeb reality that they're just able to revive these people's careers  out of nowhere for, you know, limited time.  But just take them from, you know, whatever they're doing, working at a gas station. 
[02:21:00]  And here, you're back on TV.  Yeah.  You're popular.  You're signing autographs.  All right, we're through with you.  Goodbye.  Back to your former life.  And they'll do it, too.  And a lot of people, like, the cynical take on it is just like, oh, can't these people  let go of fame?  And it's like, hey, man, if somebody's willing to pay you $10,000 to monkey it up when you  can't make $10,000 anymore, you try saying no to that shit, you know?  Yeah.  A lot of people don't realize that.  It takes black people to make celebrity reality TV interesting, because they're like the last  group in this country that's not obsessed with being polite or politically correct. 
[02:21:30]  And, you know, like, in a white show, they would never be fucking the girls and booting  them, you know?  You gotta be nice to the ladies.  Right.  They give them a rose.  Yeah.  Or not give them a rose.  We kissed once on the hand.  Flavor's fucking dumping all over them.  Flavor's grabbing ass.  Let me tell you what happened on Flavor of Love last night.  He boots the white chick off, the last remaining white chick.  And it was down to three, so now it's down to two.  So the white chick gets into it with the remaining black chick, who's just completely nuts.  And all of a sudden, she just hocks a luge on the black girl's face. 
[02:22:00]  A white chick hocks a luge at the black chick?  Oh, man.  And then all hell breaks loose.  They're complete classless girls.  It is great.  Like, he's got these real whores.  No, but we're still in a political climate in this country where if it went the other  way, if the black chick hooked a lube at...  They wouldn't show that.  They wouldn't show it, but also you'd get away with it.  But to do the white chick honking a luge at luge at luge at luge at luge at luge.  And then the black chick, her nails came out, and she grabbed her by the back of the head  and just shoves her into the camera.  I thought I was watching wrestling all of a sudden.  No, for a white girl to spit on a black girl, for them to show it is amazing because normally... 
[02:22:30]  They would never show that in a million years.  Yeah.  You know what?  I completely missed the point.  You're right.  They would never, never...  Normally, they don't show.  So hats off to them for actually going against the grain and being like, look, this is fucked  up.  Check it out.  You know what?  It's worth playing.  I got the audio.  Before we go to break.  That was the last white chick.  So now I guess the Midwest can watch in a little bit of comfort.  Yeah.  A collective sigh of relief from Pennsylvania to Utah. 
[02:23:00]  She was trashy white, though, man.  She admitted she was on Blind Date and fucked the guy there, and she's done like four or five  other shows.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Show whore?  Well, here's some audio.  It's worth playing.  I guess this is right when she got kicked off the show last night.  F***ing.  You're punking.  You're punking.  Punking.  Punking.  Come back.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You just disrespected me.  First of all, I did not disrespect you, love.  Yes, you did.  No, you disrespected me by holding information from me.  If you would have asked, I would have told you.  Everybody else in the house knew. 
[02:23:30]  Why do I have to ask?  So why everybody knows except me?  You're in my house.  I am not here for reality TV.  This is the aspiring actress standing right in front of you.  That's not fair to me, baby.  Were you trying to address me?  I just said you're the aspiring actress here.  I haven't did any TV shows, and I have not been playing with it.  I've been on Game Show on TV shows.  He knows it.  That's why I'm standing up here, and you're getting ready to get the boo.  Pumpkin is eliminated.  This f***ing b***h tries to call me out.  She's telling Flav that I'm an aspiring actress, which I am, but I've been real with Flav the whole time.  You know what? 
[02:24:00]  You know what?  You are just as ugly on the outside as you are on the inside.  Hoops, I wish you the best of luck, baby.  Thank you very much.  If you want a real girl, pick Hoops, because she's the f***ing real girl, okay?  Bye, Pumpkin.  Your opinion doesn't count.  You're getting the door right now.  All right, so now they're going at it, right?  I like the...  They built the tension with their music, of course.  So now they continue here.  At least I didn't gain 20 pounds being on the show, you fat-ass f***ing transvestite-looking,  I look better than you making your accent right now. 
[02:24:30]  Yes, the hell I do.  She's a f***ing fake bitch play.  Buy Pumpkin.  Buy Pumpkin.  New York and Pumpkin, they started going back and forth.  It was crazy.  At least I don't look like a pumpkin.  Give me a hug.  Bitch, you look like a f***ing man, and you need that facelift and get rid of the crow's  feet with that f***.  I don't even have no attention.  I'm not.  You're bigger.  Okay?  I'm not.  Okay.  I love you.  I love you too.  Get her out of here.  All right, so...  Girls and guys' fighting tactic is so different. 
[02:25:00]  Chicks are just...  You've got crow's feet.  Your ass is fat.  Could you see me and Jimmy just going out?  They tack you so fast.  Oh, Jimmy, you're so fat.  I know.  Look at my man tits.  I'd agree with you.  It's worse, though, because if you f***ing haul off and hit a dude in the eye, that eye  will heal and s***.  But when you tell a chick that she's fat, that will haunt her forever.  She's got wrinkles.  She'll be in the mirror every day looking at the side of her eyes.  What do you remember more?  The f***ing...  The people that have taken a swing at you or the people who have said s*** that just lives  in the back of your head.  It's a really heinous kind of f***ing fighting.  Girls are vicious like that, man. 
[02:25:30]  Do you hear the spit?  Do we get the spit?  Here it is right here.  This is just like The Bachelor.  It's the same show.  Actually, I can slap this s*** at you because...  Do it!  Slap me, b***h.  There's the spit.  Oh, and you hear things go f***ing shocked silence.  Who are you f***ing?  You put your f***ing hands on me.  Did you see that b***h f***ing spit in my f***ing mouth?  Miss, I will take you out.  Because I'm staying in the house and you're eliminated, you're going to spit in my f***ing 
[02:26:00]  hair.  What?  She spit in my f***ing face.  I don't play that s***.  Now you got to go for real.  I was f***ing up.  I just want to f***ing go home.  I ain't got to f***ing up.  I don't like nobody spitting in my f***ing face.  I am definitely not a fake person.  The girl I spit on, he's clearly so f***ing fake.  Like, he's trying to, like, make an excuse.  I can't even talk.  I can't even breathe.  Go home and watch the video of this, by the way. 
[02:26:30]  Because then they slow it down.  It is one of the funniest ten seconds you'll see on TV yet.  I love this girl.  Why are people so fixated with this?  Huh?  Like, I...  Like, why are you so...  I'm embarrassed to tell people I love this type of s***.  Yeah, but this is at least real.  This is the way people interact.  It's not f***ing...  Who wants to marry a millionaire with an underwear model convincing chicks to f*** him in a mansion?  Right.  This is great.  This is the next f***ing junkie, which is what Flav was...  This is what happened if you had real people vying for money.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who knows how much money Flavor Flav even still has at this point? 
[02:27:00]  It's worth $300.  It doesn't matter.  You know what it is in his house that they're in.  Yeah, most of these bitches are so stupid they really think it's his mansion.  Right.  It's not a mansion that they're just renting for the, you know, the show.  They have no idea, because they keep referring to how afterwards it's going to be me and Flav  in this mansion.  It's like, Flavor Flav, he's lucky to have a house half that size.  We're really one step away from just, like, Escape from New York, where they just f***ing  wall up the city, throw a pile of money in it, and watch people kill each other for the  f***ing money.  We really, like, some people talk about the ancient Rome and the Colosseum. 
[02:27:30]  Same thing, man.  And, oh my God, that's horrible.  This is just a different way of presenting it.  The same thing.  It's the same emotion.  It's the same rush you get watching confrontation and violence and stuff.  Same f***ing thing.  Stephen King is such a genius, because he saw this in The Running Man.  What was that, like, under the Richard Boplin books?  It was, like, the early 80s.  What was my name in that one? 
[02:28:00]  Oh, I can't remember.  Come on, Kev.  Wasn't it Ben something?  What was it?  Ben Richards.  Hi, I'm Ben Richards.  This is my thing.  Richard Dawson was the announcer.  We love the names they give Arnold in all these movies.  Hi, hi, Peter Matthews.  How are you?  Yeah, right?  You're f***ing...  Just don't even try.  All right, we have Ben Richards.  There's a movie like Total Recall was on TV last night.  What was his name in Total Recall?  There's another one, yeah.  But the villain's name was Cohagen.  Cohagen.  Which, that sounds more like Schwarzenegger's name in the movie.  But, like, he had a very plain, like, Dick Scott kind of name. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, what was his name in that?  No one knows?  Come on, fan.  We'll look it up.  IMDB.  Or go to the Answered Feedback.  Someone's got it immediately, I'm sure.  We have one more clip here from Flavor of Love.  Hold up a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  Because she got my chin.  I'm getting disrespected in the worst way.  You know what I mean?  The bitch, she spit in my hair.  And a little tiny bit got on my face.  So I'm going to whoop that bitch's ass.  And I mean it.  And that bitch breast stings to a f*** all in my hair. 
[02:29:00]  Check this out.  Check this out.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Oh, my goodness.  Listen.  You smell a f***?  Her breath smelled like straight up f***.  It smelled like a toilet full of nasty ass f***.  It's so stupid.  It's great.  Because you know the chick probably had, you know that dry, awful, sour mouth you get when  you're arguing that pasty, awful, sour ball sweat in your mouth.  Doug Quaid, by the way.  Doug Quaid.  Or Doug Hauser was also his name in that. 
[02:29:30]  Doug Quaid.  There you go.  The Flavor of Love.  I'm Doug Quaid.  Getting huge ratings, that show.  Doug is not a movie name.  It's not his.  It couldn't possibly be.  She was mad she got it in her hair.  And she's like, but she was very quick to say, only a little got on my face.  Right, right.  Like as if that made it, you know, she didn't get me.  She can leave it a little more dignity.  Right.  Exactly.  And this chick knew how to lube, man.  This thing was solid.  That is kind of, that is maybe the ultimate indignity, man.  Yeah.  Spitting on, I mean, short of f***ing getting them on the ground and pissing in their mouth. 
[02:30:00]  Spitting on them is pretty bad.  Jimmy loves that.  Is that your move, sir?  The shower?  Your fight move.  Not even a fight move.  That's the love move.  No, that's before you hand over the cash.  That's the finale.  I've seen some spit scenes in movies that have looked completely disgusting.  There's one in Dune.  Remember in Dune where the dude's like, the dude, the fat dude who flies around in the  suit.  A little spittle just in your face.  Harkin.  Yeah, Harkin.  Just horrid.  Best spit scene ever. 
[02:30:30]  Clockwork Orange.  When they want to hold him down and Mr. Deltoid spits a f***ing white line of spit  across his lip.  And it's the one man spitting in the face of another man.  And it's just a, it's not a, it's a, it's like one of those real mouthful of liquid  spits.  It is so disgusting to have to sit there or stand there and watch real spit on your lip  and how they do it.  In high school, we used to do this thing called gleeking where you take a bunch of spit on  your finger and flick it. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could really get it.  And that would really bum me out.  But that was, for some reason, that was more acceptable than just flat out being like,  pfft.  Yeah.  From finger, the fingertip removes half the germs or something like that.  And then the flight removes the other.  And you also couldn't spit into a cup and then drink it.  Right.  Yet the spit is, but it's your own spit that's in your mouth.  It's your own spit.  But once it goes back in, you're like, ah.  And swallow it.  There you go.  You ever do.  But why can't you remove it from your mouth and then back in?  Take it back in.  You ever do a wet willy where you put your fingers in your mouth and jam them in somebody's  ear?  Yeah, yeah.  That was the greatest when someone was, my friend Bill D'Angelo would drive his dumb truck 
[02:31:30]  and I'd sit behind him and spit in my fingers and jam one in each fat ear.  And it was the greatest thing I've ever done.  I was in a tent once and my friend was outside and it was a little cold.  I invited him in and did just that, Jimmy.  Let's go to Mark.  I haven't seen him in years.  I wish he'd come by the house.  A wet willy with two hands on your shoulders.  Hey, Mark, what's up, buddy?  Hey, good morning, fellas.  The only reason that they showed a white chick spitting on a black chick was  that you and I are the only two idiots that watch that show.  Actually, the ratings for that show are crazy. 
[02:32:00]  I can't believe I'm discussing this with Kevin Smith.  Is it VH1?  Yeah, they have the whole celebrity thing sewn up.  Yeah, they've actually, they've done this, their, VH1 is really into the, the celebrity,  what do you call it, celebrity?  They call it celebrity.  Yeah, they even have a name for it.  Yeah, they've really kind of championed the whole notion of like, not just real life  TV, but.  They ran out of decades to salute, so they had to come up with something else.  And it works, like apparently they do a full night of that programming and it's like  Through the Roof.  I'm hooked, I gotta admit, but.  I liked, I love the 80s.  And then they did like the 70s, which they didn't have as much info for. 
[02:32:30]  The 80s was just videotaped and a bunch of stuff.  They went to the 70s and, you know, they showed the pet rock for a half hour.  I did 90s.  I was a meme.  Yeah, we saw you guys did 90s.  Yeah.  Saw that.  But the early 90s.  Tough to be nostalgic about a decade that just ended a few years ago.  Yeah, the early 90s was cool because it was kind of like the late 80s and stuff and even  the mid 90s and stuff.  But then the late 90s was like, wasn't that last week?  Exactly.  Like I just, that just happened.  And you can't do I love the 60s.  You know, oh look, she got into the school despite the protests. 
[02:33:00]  Sick them.  Can we go take leaks, please?  Pretty much the only video they have.  It's either that or hand over a bucket.  Yes.  All right.  More with Kevin Smith in just a bit.  Come on, Jimmy.  Sing this one for everybody.  I like blacks because they're nice and they sing really good and they dance too.  Oh, that's good.  Right. 
[02:33:30]  I changed the lyrics.  People think I'm against black people.  I'm not at all.  Of course not.  I like black people very much.  This is the Opie and Anthony program.  Kevin Smith hanging out with us today.  He's downstairs just smoking a cigarette against the wall.  We got pictures and video that we're going to throw up on opieandanthony.com.  And his clerk's jacket.  Yeah, all the boys just smoking cigarettes with Kevin Smith as they lean against the old  wall outside.  That's like what you do with him to kind of be cool.  You hang out and smoke a cigarette with him.  And by the way, I don't know the lyrics to Back in Black.  That's why I did that.  I just go, Back in Black. 
[02:34:00]  Hit the set.  Right.  To be the move.  Exactly.  I just run out of...  You just got to go...  The only one that knows the words is Anthony.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, listen.  I kind of...  Listen, I got to hand it to Talkers Magazine.  They are on the pulse of what's going on in radio.  It's a brilliant, brilliant trade magazine.  It's obviously agenda-driven, by the way.  We all know exactly why this happened.  It's an agenda-driven thing.  The guy is obviously not a fan.  Actually, I'm very proud.  I'm...  I got to tell you, I'm pissed off and proud at the same time, if that's possible. 
[02:34:30]  I know we piss off so many fucking people in the radio world.  Yep.  And every once in a while, it bites us in the face.  We've annoyed a few people.  Yep.  I guess Talkers Magazine, we've been featured in Talkers Magazine many, many times.  Maybe not featured, but they have talked about us enough in Talkers Magazine.  It is an industry trade magazine, is what it is.  Right.  It's...  You don't get this on the newsstand. 
[02:35:00]  Right, right.  If you're a general manager of a station, program director, it gets sent to these people,  it gets sent to stations, things like that.  Right.  Well, they compiled a list of the top 100 talk shows in America.  Don't give it away, guys.  Don't give it away.  What is it called?  The Heavy 100.  The Heavy 100.  It's Talkers Magazine's Heavy 100 2006.  100.  100.  Yeah.  DJs or shows... 
[02:35:30]  That's right.  ...that are deemed the hottest shows on radio, talk shows on radio by Talkers Magazine.  Dude, you guys top five?  We get it, Talkers Magazine.  You hate us.  We get it.  Fucking assholes.  We get it.  All right, well, let's...  You don't like the Opie and Anthony.  I'd like to find out who compiled this.  I really would like to find out.  Well, let's give the fine folks the top 10, because we must be in the top 10, right,  guys?  Top 10.  Right, guys?  I think top five.  Number one is Howard Stern, because everyone knows he's the greatest. 
[02:36:00]  I thought we were going to go from 10 to...  No.  No.  No.  All right.  This is what we do.  We don't want the mystery.  I thought we were going to have a little mystery.  No.  No mystery.  We know what the mystery is, okay?  The mystery is where does Opie and Anthony place?  That's the mystery.  That's the mystery.  That's why I started with number one.  All right.  Atta boy, Opie.  Number one is Howard Stern, because, hey, he's the greatest.  I'll say.  Of course.  Who-hoo.  Number two is Rush Limbaugh.  Rush Limbaugh.  Number three is Sean Hannity.  Our friend Sean Hannity. 
[02:36:30]  Number four, Michael Savage.  Michael Savage.  And all these names so far deserve to be, you know, up there on this list.  Number five, Dr. Laura Schlesinger.  Who looks like a corpse in her picture, by the way.  She's awful.  Holy crap.  She should go back to the good old days of just showing her cunt to a boyfriend.  That big, hairy bush.  She's got...  It looks, in my opinion, that she's had so many facelifts that her eyes are now cross-eyed.  Yes.  Look at that picture.  Yikes.  Our pal Don Imus in sixth place.  Oh, I thought that was Dr. Laura Schlesinger. 
[02:37:00]  Fucking horse teeth she has.  Jesus Christ.  Number seven is Laura Ingram.  Laura Ingram.  Okay, now we start getting like, huh?  What?  Where most people are like, what?  Who?  Number eight is Mike Gallagher.  Mike Gallagher.  I've heard of him.  Number nine is a guy that I will spit in his face when I see him.  I have never forgotten.  Neil Bortz was one of the guys that had to be on TV when we fucked up and had to tell  the whole country how awful we were.  Who the fuck is Neil Bortz? 
[02:37:30]  Even though this fucking guy has never heard one of our shows.  Who is Neil Bortz?  Never heard of him, sir.  Never heard of him, sir.  Who is Neil Bortz?  I've heard of him, sir.  Number 10 is Randy Rhodes from Air America.  Uh-huh.  Opie, who is Neil Bortz?  He's a guy.  I don't know.  That talks.  How are you number nine when there's an R, a T, and a Z in your last name and no one  has still heard of you?  He's got 3.75 million weekly listeners, Jimmy.  I don't care if he has a billion and all of Africa. 
[02:38:00]  No one knows who Neil Bortz is.  Then you got Randy Rhodes in 10th place.  So, guys, we didn't make the top 10.  Oh, we weren't in the top 10.  I can understand that in a way.  Damn.  It's opinion-driven, Andy.  And we were out of circulation for two years.  But this is for 2005.  We were on the air the entire year.  Wait.  2006.  Huh?  Oh, for 2005.  For 2005.  Yeah, yeah.  So we were on the air.  We were on the air the entire year.  So we have no real excuses why we wouldn't make the top 10. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Well, let's see if we're in the top 20 at least.  Maybe top 20.  I'm sure we are.  Number 11 is Bill O'Reilly.  Uh-huh.  Number 12 is Mandouche.  The fastest-growing FM morning drive talk personality in the nation.  Emerging superstars.  What kind of agenda-driven?  The guy's been in radio forever.  Right.  They're making him sound like the new kid in town.  No.  And he's really not picking up many stations. 
[02:39:00]  Howard Stern leaves regular radio.  Mancow couldn't get any of those stations.  Yikes.  So I wouldn't call him the fastest-growing.  If he was that great, he would have picked up a lot of stations when Howard left.  I think we sound a little like sour grapes.  Well.  Number 13 is Ed Schultz.  Who the fuck is Ed Schultz?  It's Ed Schultz.  He's the most listened to progressive talk host in America, Jimmy.  Who are you?  He drew the peanuts of character. 
[02:39:30]  For the record, I'm going to say I hope Ed Schultz gets prostate cancer.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Then you got in 14th place, Glenn Beck.  Glenn Beck.  He's a rising star with an edgy approach to issues.  Talk radio.  And he sure has a memorable name.  The Glenn Beck Show.  Yes.  On ugh.  All right.  Look.  We got to be in the top 20.  We got to be.  Let's relax.  Next page.  If we make the top 20, it's okay.  We got to be here.  Jim Bohannon.  Bohannon.  Bohannon.  Sounds like banana, I guess.  America's most experienced late night talk show host. 
[02:40:00]  Moderate generalist radio pro.  Mm-hmm.  Then you got in 16th place, Alan Combs.  Alan Combs.  He stinks.  Alan Combs beat us out wherever we are on this list.  Alan Combs beat us out.  Well, it's got to be close now.  We got to be here soon because Alan Combs, then we got to be like, what, next?  You got to think we're in our league now.  I mean, Alan Combs, come on.  Here we go.  All right.  17th place is Jim Rome.  18th place is Al Franken from Air America. 
[02:40:30]  19th place is the transvestite, Dr. Joy Brown.  Dr. Joy Brown.  And here we are.  We got to be on 20.  The next page.  And number 20, finally.  Oh.  What?  What?  Joe Madison from WOL.  Does he do a cooking show?  The nation's preeminent issues talk host activists operating from the African-American perspective.  Oh.  Joe Madison is in 20th place as far as the top talkers in America. 
[02:41:00]  Dude, how did you guys only make top 25?  I mean, there's no way you couldn't be in the top 25.  No, we got to be in the top 25.  Don't give it away, Jimmy.  You have to be in the top 25.  All right.  Well, 21st place is Doug Steffen.  Who is that?  I haven't heard of him.  I don't even know.  I've been on radio my entire life.  I've never heard of Doug Steffen.  Never heard of him.  Dude, he is an energetic dynamo.  And how the hell did Doug Steffen beat out number 22, Bill Handel?  Because I know I would have voted for Bill Handel.  You got to vote for Bill Handel. 
[02:41:30]  Who is Bill Handel?  Bill Handel is the heart and soul of KFI.  He's one of the most.  I'll tell you who Bill Handel is.  All right.  You naysayers.  He's one of the most listened to talk show hosts in America.  And I like that because it's not generic.  Also does syndicated weekly legal show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the words of Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah, there it is.  All right.  All right.  Number 23.  Well, we got to be in the top 25. 
[02:42:00]  No.  No.  23.  It's Dave Ramsey.  Dave Ramsey.  This guy does a financial advice show.  Okay.  We can't even beat him on a financial advice show.  We can't beat the financial advice show.  Kevin, you are on.  Kevin, why are you even here?  You are on one of the worst shows in the history of radio.  Wait a minute now.  Dave Ramsey.  We've talked back in the office about how in competitive radio, Dave Ramsey is the guy that beats you.  It's all about Dave Ramsey.  It's all about Dave Ramsey.  Just so you know, Kevin, we're running down the list of the top talk radio hosts in America. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  100.  Top 100.  I believe in lowered expectations, so I like to go to the show that's not listed in the top 100.  Is that it?  Because nobody expects anything from me, though.  We thought we'd be at least 25, but we can't find ourselves here.  Who's 24, though?  Well, 24 is some lady named Kim Commando.  Commando.  Commando.  Look how they spelt it.  It's like Commando, only commando.  Dude, you ready for this?  I'm Kim Commando. 
[02:43:00]  You ready for this?  Yeah.  If this isn't an insult, Kim Commando is the talk radio industry's leading personality in computer talk.  It's a computer talk show.  Computer talk advice show.  Opie, do you know how many computers there are in the world today?  So I would say, fine.  Kim Commando is ahead of her.  I find it surprising that Dr. Laura is still number five, or up there.  I thought everyone was up in arms about her, because she said stuff about the gay community.  I hadn't heard that name in a long time.  Yeah, well, apparently she's very popular. 
[02:43:30]  Number five.  I missed number six.  I would have thought he would have been higher.  A little higher, right?  Well, higher than Dr. Laura.  Bill O'Reilly, number 11.  I thought he would have been higher, too.  We're still searching for us in this list.  We're up to 25 with Bill Bennett.  He's a historical, bright political figure now heard in syndication by more than two million listeners weekly.  All right.  I've never heard of him.  Well, you haven't been listening.  Bill Bennett's on fire.  26 is Curtis and Kubi.  You've got to give them a little bit.  Well, they should have been up on the list.  They should have beat out computer talk lady. 
[02:44:00]  When the mob tries to kill you, you would think you'd make the top 30.  Right.  So, of course.  Michael Medved is 29.  Michael Medved is 29.  George Nourie is 28.  George Nourie probably should have been a little higher on the list.  I mean, that's a massive show.  He took over for Art Bell.  Michael Medved is a movie critic?  Oh, yeah.  A movie critic.  After, Siskel and Ebert used to do a show called At the Movies.  Yeah.  Before it became, they went off and started their own show called Siskel and Ebert.  And when they left, Michael Medved and, who was the other jackass who took over? 
[02:44:30]  It was Michael Medved and, God, I forget the other dude's name.  But he was one of them.  Did they have a thing?  Because, of course, the thumbs up was a huge thing.  The thumbs up, I believe, they also used.  They used it, too?  On original rip-offs.  I know.  Until at least when Siskel and Ebert started their show, I think they might have cornered  the market.  Couldn't you give it, like, two okie-dokies where you make the circle with your fingers?  Michael Medved probably would have gave it two crosses up because he's a pretty hardcore  Christian.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's one of those cats that, like, talks about how your movie is morally repugnant. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, so he loved Dogma, I'm sure.  Yeah.  He was right up his alley.  They used to rate some of these movies on the Christian.  I was going out with a girl and there was, like, a Christian, at the time it was, like,  a pamphlet that the church gave out and it was listed in one of these Christian newspapers  and they had a rating system for movies where it was family-oriented and the last thing  was Condemned.  Right.  It was actually rated Condemned.  Right.  And those were always the movies we went to see.  We told the parents that we were going to go see one of them.  Alan Rankin is 18? 
[02:45:30]  18.  Well, we're up to 30, though, because we've got to be in the top 40.  Yeah, of course, you're in the top 30.  Two faces, the two guys, John and Ken.  Wait, that isn't us.  What?  John and Ken.  From KFI.  John Cobalt.  Consistently one of the most listened to talk shows in America.  In America.  And Ken Shampoo.  C-H-I-A-M-P-O-U.  It's Shampoo.  Shampoo.  Ken Shampoo.  Fancy spelling of shampoo.  It's shampoo, because it's a radio name, and they spell it fancy like shampoo. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, that's the Ken Shampoo here.  Then there's 31, Ron Owens.  32, Spike O'Dell.  33 is Lionel.  Lionel.  34 is our good pal, Tom Likas.  That guy's good, though, man.  Sam Likas.  Yeah.  You guys, I've never heard that show.  Do you not like Tom Likas?  He's a douchebag.  It's Ron Hulson.  We worked with him for 10 minutes here in New York, on WNEW with us for a while, and  yeah, he's really a prick to work around, near, or with. 
[02:46:30]  Was he here, did he move out here?  Because I thought he was like an L.A. person.  He is an L.A. guy, but I guess New York's the number one radio market, so he kind of,  I guess he gets the offer.  So did he actually physically come out here?  He physically came out here to do radio out here.  Oh, it just tanked me.  He fell twice in New York, so far, man.  He's one of these guys, like, we like having fun with our female listeners.  Right.  We're nasty at times and stuff, but they all know we love women.  Right.  We really do.  This guy is just such a cock about women, and when the word misogynistic comes out, 
[02:47:00]  it's just, he's the poster boy.  And you can tell it just came from chicks never, ever giving him the time of day when he was  growing up.  He's got, there are allegations of domestic violence in his house at a Christmas, after  a Christmas party in Boston.  He apparently went home, and it's alleged that he got into a fight with his wife.  This made the newspaper, by the way.  At his house, and threw her into the fireplace. 
[02:47:30]  I'm Tom Likas!  Yeah, right.  And we just pictured, like, you know, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  with a fight going, and the tree blinking nicely, and then him just flinging her into the  nice U-log in the fireplace.  Unbelievable.  So, when you've reached a position where people, some people know who you are, I think nobody  should ever be causing violence to anybody else.  No.  Nobody should ever be causing violence to a man on, a man on woman violence, particularly 
[02:48:00]  is a no-no.  But when you've reached some level of, like, hey, people know your name.  Know you, yeah.  You can, you cannot even think about hitting a woman anymore.  Your days are done doing that.  You can't even, like, sit there going, if I was fighting balls, I'd fucking smack her in  a face.  You can't, you can't think about it.  No.  To do that, it's just career suicide.  Well, yet you can still be what number?  Hey, Dr. Ian Smith, how are you, sir?  There he is.  Number 34.  Well, the list goes on and on and on and on and on and on.  Of course it does.  I guess we can pick up the list a little later.  Yes.  We're up to 34, and your pals, Opie and Anthony, are still unmanaged. 
[02:48:30]  We'll see if we're in the top 50s.  I think you're right around here.  All right.  We gotta be, right?  We'll get back to the list in a sec.  Dr. Ian Smith, that's Kevin Smith.  Hi, how are you?  Hey, Kevin, how are you?  Good to meet you, sir.  Good to see you.  And we got Gunnar Nelson on the phone here.  Gun man.  Gunnar!  Yo.  What's up, man?  Sorry to make you wait there.  We were waiting for Ian Smith to show up.  That's okay.  That's okay.  No problem.  That's my man.  And, of course, we're talking about Celebrity Fit Club.  Yes.  Dr. Ian Smith is one of the panelists that actually gets to weigh them every week on the show. 
[02:49:00]  It's a lot of fun, the weighing.  That's right.  Yes.  Yes, we get to enjoy Dr. Ian's teeth every week.  Gunnar, don't start.  You do have some wonderful choppers on you there.  He does, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Floss.  You do a lot of the floss things.  Yeah, I floss, and I don't eat sweets.  It's breathtaking.  You look like a handsome Chris Rock.  Everyone says that.  Has he heard that?  Yeah, and Chris Rock weighs about 10 pounds.  Well, you look like a fuller.  Now you sound like a handsome Chris Rock.  Put a little Chris Rock in that delivery right there. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, we heard that coming.  So, and then Gunnar Nelson, if you were watching Celebrity Fit Club, took over for Jeff Conway,  who had major, major problems there and went into rehab.  Yeah, he was really fucked up.  Nothing against you, Gunnar, but I was very bummed when they said goodbye to Jeff Conway  because I thought it made great TV because he was such a mess on the show.  Oh, yeah.  You know, there's great TV, and then there's just kind of like just dangerous to everybody  around him, and it was pretty bad.  But, you know, it was just the Benadryl. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, but you aren't quite as messed up, like, physically either.  Yeah, that's what I was getting at.  So they get rid of Jeff Conway and like, all right, they got to introduce a new fatty.  And all of a sudden, Gunnar Nelson walks out, and he's like, yeah, I only got a five-pack.  I want a six-pack.  I think I need to use two pounds.  All right, join the rest of the world there, Gunnar.  No, guys, I was actually just coming up and doing a radio show for a lifetime for a year,  and you know what the hours are like, and all of a sudden I'm doing a morning show, and  I just did kind of let myself go. 
[02:50:30]  And I don't know, I was supposed to represent the millions of Americans who were not looking  like they looked in high school, and as Ken ran an extra, I thought, like, an extra 15  pounds, I wound up losing 30 pounds.  You lost 30 pounds on the show?  Well, I got to be honest with you.  Gunnar, let me just say something here.  You know, when they said that Gunnar Nelson was coming, and I said, okay, fine, let me  see a picture of him.  And they showed me a picture, I was like, no.  Yeah, like, why?  Like, I was like, no, I can't do this.  I mean, my credibility to the viewers is they're going to be like, reject him.  And then, you know, after talking to Gunnar and saying, okay, fine, you'll represent people 
[02:51:00]  who only have maybe 10 or 5 pounds who can't lose it because they say,  I can't lose the last 5 pounds, Dr. Yun.  And I said, and then Gunnar was like, crazy.  Like, the man is crazy.  He was like, he followed the diet to the T.  Like, I was getting scared because he kept losing weight every time.  And I was like, oh, my goodness.  So to his credit, he's the hardest working guy.  It got kind of funny because, you know, he obviously lost the weight he needed to lose,  and then he wanted to lose more.  And I'm like, yeah, you go, man.  Just start anorexic in front of our eyes, please.  Get an eating disorder, please.  Celebrity Fit Club sponsors anorexia. 
[02:51:30]  And then they have to do, like, these things, you know, what was it?  Fit Camp, I guess it's called, right?  And Gunnar and Nelson's just kicking everyone's ass because he's like 165 pounds or whatever.  Yeah.  160 pounds.  He's in shape.  And you got a couple that were over 300, and everyone else hasn't, you know, ran in years.  Yeah.  And he's just killing everybody, and everyone else is pissed off at him.  Yeah, but you know what?  I got to tell you, the Fit Camps, I mean, the Fit Camps, you guys don't see the full Fit Camp  or what happens, and sometimes on the sideline you get pissed off because, you know, these 
[02:52:00]  are celebrities, and they get pampered and stuff like that, but if you sign up on a show  to get in shape, then you need to work out.  I mean, that's what it's all part of.  And, you know, there's some friction about, you know, whether the workouts were too hard  and blah, blah, blah.  Too hard.  Nonsense.  And right, it was nothing.  It was nothing.  They were doing, like, 15-minute, like, drills, like, before, you know, the challenge.  I'm like, you guys, relax.  I mean, you know.  I don't want to do this.  Where's craft services, right?  Well, yeah, you had a whole bunch of people that were running the spectrum as far as their  attitudes and what they were really there for. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, Kelly LeBrock was awesome.  I mean, truly awesome.  Yes.  And driven and stuff.  And then you had, you know, people on the other end of the spectrum, which were like,  you wondered why they were even there in the first place, seriously.  And it was every single week.  I know why they were there.  They just wanted FaceTime.  They wanted exposure.  Did you say Kelly LeBrock?  I was shocked at how Kelly LeBrock had let herself go.  Weird science, Kelly LeBrock?  Yeah.  Dude, probably one of the hottest.  She was still hot when she was fat.  She was still hot.  I went on the radio and said, no.  Definitely.  I said, yes. 
[02:53:00]  You know why?  Maybe if she was walking down the street and you saw her and went, wow, okay, for a chubby  girl that she's pretty hot, she was iconic as the hot chick of the 80s when she comes out  of that bathroom door and the bikini briefs and the little half shirt, that was so mega  hot that even if she was a little chunky, it was like, oh, she fucked up, man.  Fucked up.  Steven Seagal's a fatso now, though.  He put on like 35 pounds. 
[02:53:30]  I never jerked off to Steven Seagal.  Speak for yourself, fella.  That guy was quite a tussler.  What is the diet, may I ask?  Oh, sure.  It's called the Fat Smash Diet.  Okay.  And basically, it's a four-phase diet that starts off with a detox.  Right.  And the crazy thing is that when all the celebrities saw my detox plan, it was a nine-day natural  detox.  Oh, you know, I can't do this.  I can't just eat this stuff, blah, blah, blah.  They come in after nine days.  They're losing nine pounds, eight pounds, seven pounds.  And they're like, oh, actually, this thing works.  I'm like, hello. 
[02:54:00]  I mean, you know.  Is it like lemon juice, psyllium husk?  No, no.  It's all fruits and vegetables.  Really?  You can't eat white potatoes, white rice, white bread, and no alcohol.  It's a racist diet.  I'll say that.  Jesus Christ.  First time to call a racist before, but okay.  I thought I was making some headway.  No golden girls.  No happy days.  But no, the diet, you know, it's a great diet.  And the crazy thing is that when the people started stealing, like the cast started stealing 
[02:54:30]  the diet, because I made the celebrity sign a confidentiality agreement.  Like, only you guys could see it.  Next thing I know, I'm in a script meeting, and the director, I'm like, man, you're looking  really good.  And he's like, well, I got to be honest with you.  You know, I'm doing your diet.  And I'm like, what?  I haven't even published it yet.  What are you doing?  So, now, Gunner was, Gunner, Young MC, Chaz, and Kelly LeBrock.  Those guys were awesome.  How much did Kelly LeBrock lose?  Kelly lost, I have my little notes here.  Kelly lost 31 pounds.  She started off at 175.  She's now down to 144 and lost 8% body fat. 
[02:55:00]  She was 175?  Yeah.  She was a big, that's why when she first came on the show, she was a rack.  How tall is she, 9'3"?  How does she get so good fat?  Paul, girl.  She said on the show, she was sick of being a sex symbol, and just was like, you know.  But you know what the point is?  That was her excuse.  They all have these cute excuses why there's stuff in their face.  Like, it was a conscious decision to just blow up.  Yeah, like, I'm so sick, everyone's looking at me like a sex symbol.  I'm going to just live my life.  The Snapple Lady's excuse.  But I love Kelly.  What was her excuse?  Her excuse was, she...  This is Wendy, the Snapple Lady? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  She was growing up, not even growing up, she was a baby still.  Right.  And her parents had another kid.  Decide to have another kid.  And she started eating.  She just wanted to eat.  Yeah.  That's her excuse for being as big as she is.  Yeah.  And by the way, Celebrity Fit Club blew it.  They should bring Wendy Snapple back every year.  Everybody says that.  Everyone knows what it is.  When she's crying...  So we can just openly laugh at her.  When she's crying about not getting the attention from her parents, I love that shit.  Wendy's awesome.  But let me tell you about Kelly.  Kelly kept saying, you know, I blew up, basically, and stopped. 
[02:56:00]  I didn't want to be a sex symbol anymore.  And then every way in...  Mission accomplished.  Well, but no, but every way in that she came in, losing five, six pounds, she wore tighter  dresses.  Cleavage started coming up.  And I was like, you guys, I told the producers, let's do a montage of her saying, I don't want  to look sexy anymore.  And then show her in all these things, boom, boom, boom.  But they didn't go for it.  But that would have been...  Why didn't they go for it?  That's great.  Yeah, that's good TV right there.  Can we put Gunner in sexy things, then?  Gunner?  Well, I just put me in Kelly's sexy things.  That's fine with me. 
[02:56:30]  Gunner's got one of those.  Make sure she's still in it.  Gunner and Nelson have one of the best Beavis and Butthead scenes ever.  You remember that one, Gunner?  No.  Which one was that?  Come on, guys.  Where you guys are playing, and they went, hey, who are these chicks?  Yeah, these chicks are hot.  These chicks are hot.  That's the best.  Hey, Gunner, the cast hated you, huh?  No, no.  Actually, I got to work pretty well with just about everybody except for Tempest.  Tempest, she had an attitude, man.  She did not want to be there.  Tempest from the Cosby show, yeah. 
[02:57:00]  I'm not saying a word.  I got in trouble already for saying something on radio about her.  I got all these hate emails.  All right, don't say it on this show, but tell us what you said on the other show.  Look, all I'm saying is I feel sorry for Tempest.  It just makes her life a whole lot harder on herself than it needs to be.  She didn't realize what she got herself into, it looks like.  Didn't want to work that hard?  No.  Did she lose weight?  Yeah, she lost.  Yeah, Tempest lost 19 pounds.  You know, guys, it really wasn't all just about losing the weight thing.  It wasn't supposed to be.  It was really supposed to be. 
[02:57:30]  Your body's a reflection of what's going on inside.  She came across like a bitch on that show, I got to say.  Dr. Ian Smith's not going to comment.  Well, I'm going to slowly do a little something something because, you know,  don't send me any hate emails saying I'm not a black anymore because I'm criticizing the black.  Please, I don't want to get that nonsense.  That's what you have to deal with?  Really?  Oh, it's nonsense.  Ian, what the heck does that have to do with anything?  Gunnar, when you and I were on Wendy Williams, the emails I got after that show were, like,  basically I lost my black card.  It's like, are you crazy?  Because I can't criticize someone.  Does that mean there's a black card up for grabs?  I got one years ago from Chris Darden. 
[02:58:00]  Where's that guy?  Anyway, let me just say this and then I'll shut up about Tempest.  My issue with Tempest is, listen, everyone is a celebrity in their own right.  Like, you're amongst peers.  Like, no one's bigger than anyone else.  I mean, Kelly LeBrock in her day, like you said, was iconic.  Bruce Valanche has been, you know, great these days.  They were all bigger than Ant, who acts like he's the biggest celebrity on the show.  Who?  Ugh.  Ant.  Can I say it?  Oh, but he's so flamboyant. 
[02:58:30]  I actually love the show, but I can't stand watching him host that show.  I hate it.  You could make the argument that Tempest's Blood show might have been the most well-known  because that show was massive.  The show was huge.  For so many years.  Yeah.  Which show?  Cosmic show.  You know Jimmy, right?  You remember the Cosmic show?  I don't remember her.  She was the middle girl.  She was the middle girl.  The middle daughter.  Yeah.  But anyway, she lost 19 pounds.  Hey, Tempest, if you're listening or someone tells you, I love, this is Dr. Ian, I love  Tempest's Blood show, but it's like, let's not have attitude. 
[02:59:00]  I mean, do what you got to do.  I mean, it's a show about losing weight and getting your butt kicked.  Yeah, she did it to herself.  Isn't that what makes it like an entertaining TV for people to watch, though?  They want to see somebody be, somebody has to be the designated asshole.  Yeah.  Well, Jeff Conway was just, oh, he was a classic.  Yeah.  And then he comes back from rehab and he brings the Benadryl box to prove that he wasn't on  drugs.  He just happened to have Benadryl when they filmed him all fucked up.  Are you freaking kidding me?  I'm going to set the record.  I know.  Because he came after me.  He came after me about that.  Listen, Benadryl may cause drowsiness, but too, Benadryl does not cause what's called 
[02:59:30]  an ataxic gait, where you're walking around like you're freaking you had, you know,  10 bottles of whiskey.  I mean, the guy was falling asleep.  He was slurring.  He couldn't have a coherent conversation.  He was a train wreck.  He was harmful to people.  That's why he had to go to rehab.  I mean, Steve C., our own producer.  Yeah.  Same thing.  Same thing.  Wow.  And he was trying to pass for being affected by Benadryl to a doctor.  Kevin, it made great. 
[03:00:00]  Can you believe that?  That's funny.  It made for great TV because they kicked him off the show.  He was such a mess.  He comes back like 30 days later or something like that.  And everyone is like has tears in their eyes.  Oh my God, he's taking care of his problems.  This is pretty cool.  And then he gets up there and goes after Ian saying, look, it was Benadryl that day.  Right away.  I'm standing by that.  He comes at me and I'm like.  Apparently a hickey from Kenickie is like two Benadryls.  I saw Jeff about five days ago.  Yeah.  And man, I hope he gets his stuff together because it's not together yet. 
[03:00:30]  I bet Benadryl sales went up.  Totally.  People go, that gets me that fucked up.  Benadryl gets you fucked up?  Wow.  Give me it.  And I got another rash of emails from people.  How could you as a doctor say that Benadryl doesn't do that?  Hello?  I mean, are you kidding me?  Did you see him?  I mean, his own doctor, Dr. Drew, said the guy has an addiction problem.  I mean, the emails.  Dr. Ian Benadryl can do that.  I've taken Benadryl.  Yeah.  Stop reading your emails.  Yeah, don't read the emails.  Don't read the message for us.  We've all been through this.  We've all been through this.  We'll walk you through.  The only time you read email is if it's from a girl and there's like a pick attachment. 
[03:01:00]  If she's fucking kidding me, that's it.  J-Pig, right?  But I didn't see the final show.  I've seen every show.  I didn't see the final one.  I had a crash early last night.  Can I tell you what happened?  Yeah, I don't care.  Okay.  It's not like it's going to be a huge surprise.  Yeah.  But okay.  So the winner was Young MC.  How much did he lose?  38 pounds.  He went from 278 to 240.  And then the next was Bazaar, the rapper, Eminem's crew.  He lost 32 pounds.  Then Kelly lost 31 pounds.  Chaz.  Chaz could have lost more Gunnar. 
[03:01:30]  I mean, she had three weeks where she stalled.  She just stalled.  But she lost 24 pounds even with three bad weigh-ins.  And then Bruce.  She's got to stop wearing the man clothes, though.  Who's Chaz?  I know Chaz Cibono.  She's great.  She seems really nice.  Has a great personality.  But the men clothes, I understand it's her lifestyle.  But man, dude.  Her lifestyle, yeah.  Soften up a little bit, please.  Remember when Sonny and Cher used to bring her out as a little kid during the Sonny and  Cher variety hour?  And now she's...  Good night, Chaz.  Today she had little pigtails and waving.  Well, on Celebrity Fit Club, she's wearing blazers. 
[03:02:00]  She's wearing men's blazers.  And there's also nothing decidedly heterosexual about a dress.  Easy access is easy access.  There you go.  All right.  That's true.  I like that.  The guy makes a valid point.  Very valid.  Yeah.  So anyway, so these guys did well.  You know, Kelly's team won.  Hey, what's her name end up gaining weight?  Countess Vaughn.  She gained four pounds.  Wow, really?  Somebody gained weight on her?  She's from the Parkers.  She's a little thing.  Don't you know the Parkers?  I got nasty emails about that.  Dr. Ian, how could you be a black person and not watch the Parkers? 
[03:02:30]  It's a UPN show, isn't it?  Wow.  It was a UPN show.  I'm serious.  Like what?  I have to watch every black show in America?  Yeah.  Anyway, she gained four pounds and...  Oh, that's funny, man.  No.  I'm going to stay...  I'm not going to say anything.  Gunnar, you say something.  Gunnar, why am I talking?  Yeah, Gunnar.  Well, because we got nine people talking at the same time.  I'll tell you what.  She actually...  She was full of it.  This girl, Countess, made everything up about her whole side story.  Oh, my life is so hard. 
[03:03:00]  I'm not losing weight every week because I'm under so much stress and I'm in a divorce  and these tears were coming.  It was all bullshit.  The whole thing was bullshit.  She was there for the paycheck.  She fooled the producers.  She said she wasn't going to follow the diet.  She wasn't going to work out.  She was going to collect her check every week and that's it and that's what she did.  So she gained four pounds.  But here's what I have to say.  For all these people who were on the show, some people took advantage of the situation.  Some people just totally wasted it and that was their choice to do.  Look, someone came to me and said, I'm going to give you a good paycheck. 
[03:03:30]  I'm going to give you all the support, a nutritionist, a drill instructor, a really hot psychiatrist  and a fixed amount of time to get your life together.  Who wouldn't take someone up on that?  Some people, funny enough, didn't.  And Countess was one of those people.  I couldn't understand it.  See, that's why I got as a soldier.  That's why he was the best because he and Kelly were the best and got young because they were very serious.  Like they wanted to leave the show after...  It was only 100 days and they wanted to leave the show looking much better, feeling much better and look at him now. 
[03:04:00]  And they go back to their regular lives for two weeks, right?  And you fly back out to L.A. every two weeks?  Every two weeks.  Yeah, that's right.  I mean, I actually live in Nashville, so I was doing the commute and stuff.  But, you know, Ian, I also...  Your diet really did work for me because, guys, I had a third less time than everybody else.  I was replacing Jeff.  Yeah, that's right.  I only did it in 60 days.  Where do we find this diet?  It's on fatsmashdiet.com or amazon.com.  Fatsmashdiet.com.  It's a book.  Put it out as a book.  Do you have copies?  You know, I just came from South Carolina. 
[03:04:30]  I just told Roland, I wish I had...  I'll send you guys some.  I'd love a copy.  I need to lose...  How much do you need?  He's lost a lot of weight, actually.  I want to lose probably 15 pounds.  That's it?  Yeah.  Oh, that's easy.  Oh, well, I think you'll look at me and go, hey, fats, I'll lose 40.  No, no, no.  Thanks, Doc.  No, no, no.  What's the easiest way to lose 10, 15 pounds?  I'll tell you what.  You've got to start eating.  Yes.  You've got to start eating.  You've got to eat a bunch of meals a day, right?  Small meals, multiple meals, like four or five. 
[03:05:00]  Seriously.  Like, people think starvation helps.  Starvation just slows your metabolism down.  You just end up gaining weight.  So all the...  It's completely counterintuitive.  When he told me, hey, look, you've got to turn up the wick.  What I was doing, I was working on the show and working on music.  And the other day, I went, wow, you know, I'm really hungry.  And I would gorge on one meal and then go to sleep on that.  And I was putting on weight like crazy.  And when someone says, every two hours, you've got to be eating.  I was eating.  I mean, Ian said like four meals a day.  I was eating like seven or eight.  Wonderful.  Every two hours, I was eating. 
[03:05:30]  And my God, man, every week, it was like, wow, I've just lost four pounds.  But you've got to eat healthy, though, right?  Like, you know, I went to McDonald's last night for the first time in months.  Honestly, God, because I wanted to fart in the studio.  And it didn't work.  I had two cheeseburgers.  I was just suicidal.  I'm like, my mouth is dry.  I'm like, why did I do this to myself?  When are we doing the fart off this week?  Probably, yeah.  I just wanted to give you a little sample.  But I just couldn't do it.  I don't understand why we're not on this list.  I'm not participating.  With great topics like this.  All right, so I have to eat more?  Yeah.  In two months, you will lose 15 pounds. 
[03:06:00]  That's my commitment to you.  Yeah.  I'm going to work with you.  I just did, last year, I did, during the summer, I went on Optifast.  You know, it's like a liquid diet kind of thing.  It's 800 calories a day.  And I lost 70 pounds over three months.  Oh, yeah, you lost a lot of weight.  But that's like, you've got to give up solids for a while.  But the re-entry is difficult.  That's my problem right there, is that these programs where it's like liquid diets, well,  okay, when you're done, then what?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  You've got to eat regular foods again.  Then you have to slowly bring food back in.  And the moment you start eating again, you're putting on pounds, but it's not all of it.  You've just got to kind of figure it out. 
[03:06:30]  That's why my program is like this four-phase, where we do a detox, then you slowly, you can  eat pizza and stuff on my diet, but you work up to that.  Like, you just don't kind of go crazy after the detox.  Right.  My thing had to be easy, because I'm touring all the time.  I'm all over the country on airports and bad hours and all that kind of stuff, and it  had to work.  And the liquid diet thing, obviously, would work, but it totally changes your lifestyle.  This thing, I just fit it into my lifestyle, and it worked fine.  I find it harder to work out on the road.  I don't know, I like the gym where I live.  I go on the road, they have these shitty fitness rooms. 
[03:07:00]  That's just depressing.  They're stupid.  50-year-old ladies, that's their workout.  So old, universal sets, when I grew up as a kid, people don't use that stuff anymore.  That's a waste.  They say, we have a fitness club.  I'm like, yeah, right.  He's worried about dirty workout equipment.  He goes to Brazil and fucks hookers without any contraception.  That was one incident, twice.  Why don't you tell Dr. Ian Smith about your diet there, Jimmy?  Yeah, tell me.  Your late night diet.  Occasionally, I've dabbled with, you know, I was in Brazil. 
[03:07:30]  I love Brazil.  Me too.  You're in Coba Cabana?  Ooh-wee.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  You go to the little houses.  What's the word for them?  There's a word for them.  Whorehouse.  What?  Whorehouse.  No, not brothel.  Not brothel.  No, no, it's a Brazilian.  It's a Brazilian word.  I know what you're saying, too.  I just, for the record, I didn't frequent them.  No, no, no.  For the record, let me stay.  But there was one called the Monte Carlo, which I would go to with Patrice and a couple  other guys.  It might help you with the calories of what you were eating. 
[03:08:00]  Sex is a great...  Let me tell you, one of the best workouts is sex.  I'm not kidding you.  Like, one of the best way to...  Not the way I do it.  It's like doing one push-up and falling asleep.  Can I tell you something?  When I went to Rio, right, we went to this place, and we thought we were in a nice little  restaurant, right?  And all of a sudden, I said to my guys, we just landed.  I'm like, oh my goodness, these are the hottest babes in the world, right?  And they're giving us the eye.  So we're like, whoo-wee, Americans, you know, we're coming up.  They were hookers.  Of course.  Yeah.  They were completely working.  Not only were they hookers, they were probably tranny hookers, man.  Those Brazilians got those she-males that are fucking to die for. 
[03:08:30]  I was obsessed with...  Honestly, I didn't want a tranny.  I was like, so...  I saw so many chicks, they're like, that's a tranny.  And they're like, no, it's not.  I'm like, that's a fucking tranny.  And I wouldn't touch half the chicks down there for that reason.  Yeah.  But the other half...  If you look at she-male porn on the web, which I do quite often, apparently, because  I can give you the distinction.  You certainly can.  The Brazilian she-male sites have chicks that...  Guys that absolutely fucking look like girls.  Are you a Joey Silvera fan, are you?  I don't know.  Who's that?  Okay, good.  Good cover.  Jimmy will tell you. 
[03:09:00]  No guy should die before they go to Rio, I'm telling you.  No guy should die.  I've spent three trips, I can't go back, I'm afraid, because there's so much crime down  there, it's a very dangerous area.  I mean, the drug lords really do run the whole city from the projects, so it's very frightening  to be there.  Favelas, that's what they're called.  Favelas, right, right.  But the little whorehouses are called something, if Patrice is listening right now, he's screaming  at his radio, I cannot remember what they're called, but it's just too dangerous  to go back.  What was the diet you were talking about?  What was he eating?  Oh, it's up to Jimmy if he wants to tell...  Oh, he's just...  And then he can help you out with how many calories that might be. 
[03:09:30]  There was one girl in the whorehouse who I did have sex with two days in a row, and  I had a condom, but it remained in my wallet, and I kind of went unprotected twice with  the same Brazilian hooker.  It can't happen to me.  That's why I did it.  No, seriously, like I'm...  Jesus.  No, I got to ask a serious question.  It was a diet called I Dare You, God.  That doesn't scare you?  Like, I would be...  No.  I couldn't get up.  If I'm in that situation, literally, I'd be so scared that I couldn't get up.  Like, I wouldn't be able to do it, I don't think. 
[03:10:00]  Well...  Especially, it's a foreign country with a hooker.  But she...  But it was...  Because she kept going, you're special.  You're special.  Oh, okay.  I was like, all right.  I'm special.  Tell him about the log.  Well, that's what I was...  There's got to be some kind of oral thing going on here, because he keeps hinting at calories.  What?  All right, well...  Oh, come on, dude.  She crapped in your mouth, Sarah.  Is that what he's saying?  No, it never...  No, not in a foreign country.  That's disgusting.  Not in a foreign country.  I don't know what they're eating in Brazil. 
[03:10:30]  All right, there you go.  Well, Jimmy's on a liquid diet sometimes.  Sometimes he's on a liquid diet.  I'm not...  I've had some golden shower.  You know, who hasn't?  Where he's had to put down the plastic on the floor of the bathroom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You ever see Lethal Weapon 2?  Yeah.  When the guy gets shot in the office?  That's kind of what my bathroom looks like during sex.  Lovely.  I'm an enchanting individual.  But again, I want to lose 15 pounds.  I'm tired of paying for it.  No, I want to lose 15 pounds.  And apparently drinking piss isn't working, so he's looking for something else.  No, that will never change.  That's actually just, you know, show me who's boss. 
[03:11:00]  You are.  All right, I got you.  There was an article I read online yesterday, most disturbing article I've ever read in the newspaper  about this dude who was arrested in Ohio for, and they still can't figure out what the exact charge is.  But I guess he was, a parent saw him, a parent was in the bathroom with their kid, and they  saw this dude kind of leering at their kid, so they alerted the cops.  Cops arrested the dude.  And in the interrogation process of talking to this guy, who I guess wasn't a suspect,  they just kind of brought him in for questioning, he started talking about how into drinking  children's urine he is, little boy's urine. 
[03:11:30]  And he has this elaborate system where he'll go into a public bathroom, turn the plumbing off,  stick a cup of some sort in both the urinal and the toilet, wait until the kids use it,  and then leave, collect it, and drink it.  And his quote was, you can find it online, you can Google it.  The quote was, it makes, I feel like I'm drinking their youth.  Oh, so it's kind of a vampire-like thing.  Yeah, first of all, that's not what I said.  I read the same story, and I mean, with the chick I've done stuff like that, that guy 
[03:12:00]  should be executed, because he's a child-toucher, he's a kid-toucher.  And that's the thing, he was convicted of some form of child 13 years prior.  I mean, that's why they might have arrested him, I guess he's a violation of some kind  of sure there's natural law.  They'll come up with something.  You know, I think we should be more extreme, seriously, with molesters, like some of those  other countries.  That's the crime we should really, like, institute the death penalty for.  That rape, I mean, it can't be just like, if you kill somebody, you could kill.  I think Gunner got bored. 
[03:12:30]  Gunner.  Gunner got bored, I think, he just hung up.  Gunner?  No, he's gone.  Missed her.  Doesn't want to be part of this conversation.  He's like, what?  Piss-drinking?  I'm out of here.  What?  Yeah, I've heard enough, thank you.  He's like, I'm close to a comeback, goddammit, I can't be part of this.  Yeah, right?  Well, you're saying that might be more extreme with child molesters.  Yeah, because I just think that, I mean, you've got, like, the weakest of the weak who  cannot protect themselves, okay, and you have adults preying on them.  I mean, that's worse than murder, I think, because these kids, afterward, have to live 
[03:13:00]  the rest of their lives.  Oh, the trickle-down is intense.  Yeah.  It's basically ruined one person's life, and you probably, they wind up being kind of  involved in child molestation themselves.  They're melodiously down the road.  Yeah, they're going to be like a carrier, and peripherally, they're going to affect everybody  they're with.  Totally, totally.  So the trickle-down is insane.  It's unbelievable.  The riffle's ridiculous.  So I agree, kill them.  Sometimes murder, I mean, you walk in, you know, your girl's there with another guy or  something like that, it hits you spur-of-the-moment like that.  Sometimes murder is completely reasonable.  Crime of passion.  Crime of passion.  Things like that. 
[03:13:30]  That, there's no way to rationalize it.  It's not reasonable.  There's no, like, I, you know, I was in the heat of the moment, I shut off the plumbing,  put a cup in the toilet, that kind of thing.  And the recidivism rate is like, what is it, like 80% or so?  It's disgustingly high.  It's not like most of them get better.  They're just fucking-  There's that national registry website where you can go and enter your zip code and see-  Yeah, yeah.  Just on that.  And not just the, and this isn't a full list of all the child molesters.  These are just the ones they've caught.  Yep.  And it's fucking frightening when you look around your area. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  And you can find out how many registered pedophiles are where you live.  Doesn't matter where you live, you'll see a lot of dots.  You'll see tons of them.  You'll see a lot of dots, yeah.  And I think the scariest part about it is the ones that aren't listed.  Just knowing, like, if these many are listed, how many more are out there that we don't  know about?  Horrible.  Well, we watched that, what was that special, 2020?  Perverted Justice.  Perverted Justice, where they have the hidden cameras.  Dateline.  Hidden cameras in a house.  People go online, pose as children, and invite them over their house.  Oh, yeah, I saw that.  I saw that.  And the hidden cameras are there, and these guys showed up in three days, 55, I think, 
[03:14:30]  or 53 guys showed up.  Did they arrest them?  For every single one of them.  Is that considered entrapment?  Whatever it's considered, I don't think they gave a shit.  One guy came back.  One guy they released, like they said, you know, okay, you know, be good, blah, blah,  he promised.  And a week later, the guy comes back again.  He came back again.  Outside the McDonald's, and then the guy's probably thinking, it couldn't happen again.  And he's going to get that young dick, and all of a sudden, the camera crowed.  He's like, fuck. 
[03:15:00]  Why would you come back?  Crazy.  But episode three, they finally started arresting these guys, because the first two they did,  they just let them go.  Yeah, it was just a news report.  But I'm sure they were gay.  The reporter would come out and confront them with cameras in their faces and ruin their lives.  You know what happened with Dateline?  They were probably getting a lot of email, like, what the fuck are you guys doing?  Letting these people go?  The guy isn't working anymore.  He loses his wife, his job, and everybody's still walking around, you know?  So these guys, they arrested them.  And rightfully so, man.  Let the life be ruined.  Oh, the hot girls.  This is a pal talk.  We have a lot of fun with this.  Oh, wow.  See, we're on camera over here. 
[03:15:30]  Right.  And they could all see us.  And then we have various, you know, it's always better to pop the girls up than, you  know, the guys.  Yeah.  You missed this morning.  You said when we started, there was a very hot couple from Long Island banging for us.  Having sex.  Yeah.  That's how we started today's show.  That's how we started today's show.  You could see it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This pal talk is amazing.  Why do you guys bring me to 10 o'clock?  What's wrong with you?  That's discrimination.  Yeah.  Maybe Beach Bunny.  Beach Bunny, you want to give a little show over here?  Please.  She's very nice.  If she could just flash a little bit. 
[03:16:00]  Show the good doc to your bosoms.  There you go.  Hold on.  Let me bring this over.  There you are.  There we go.  Wow.  See, isn't that great?  Wow.  XM is unbelievable.  Holy cow.  I'm an XM convert.  Isn't that nice?  Holy cow.  Thank you, Beach Bunny.  She's lovely.  Yeah.  19 years old.  Healthy young bosoms.  How do you find these guys?  They just come on the, they come on pal talk.  They got the cameras.  You should see what happens in some of these other rooms.  There are rooms that are, you go into the adult room, categories, there's bi, man on 
[03:16:30]  man, woman on woman, man, woman.  It's just rooms where there's hundreds of guys just jacking off on camera.  Wah, wah, wah.  I know.  And you got to go under and assume names so nobody recognizes you.  They recognize your floor.  Hopefully they don't see a familiar tattoo or something.  That dude's wearing a silent bob coat.  See that?  We should take a break.  You want to hang?  It's up to you, Dr. A.  Yeah, I'll hang.  I love this.  My first XM deal. 
[03:17:00]  We only got like 10 minutes left in the show anyway.  All right.  And you're blown up.  You started on local TV.  I remember seeing you on the local news.  Remember WNBC?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those are the days, huh?  You did the medical...  Medical correspondent.  Yeah.  Now look what I'm doing.  Now I'm chasing around celebrities with attitude.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Are you guys going to bring Wendy back for the next show?  I got to tell you, she's got the number one hit on the website.  Everyone keeps saying, bring her back.  Bring her back.  You know who I want?  Tanya Harding.  Is she a fatty now?  What?  Holy shit.  The insider's been doing a bunch of things with her recently.  God damn it.  Because of the Olympics. 
[03:17:30]  She is massive.  You wouldn't recognize her.  Seriously.  She's unbelievable.  I mean, I'd get her on my diet.  I would work her butt out.  I'm telling you.  How many pounds do you think she gained?  50?  Minimum.  She's probably 70.  Is she still a Jeff Galooly?  No.  No.  You remember the guy, Jeff Galooly?  How could you not?  It was very impressive.  And he really banged it well on their honeymoon and then released it.  How do you not love Jeff Galooly?  Jesus.  His name should be on the dollar bill.  I just know the most interesting thing about that porn was afterwards, she had a bunch  of his fucking spunk in her hand and she held it up to the camera. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  It's such a weird way to end it.  I don't remember that part.  Happy honeymoon.  I don't think I know you're going to remember this.  Oh, baby.  So strange.  All right.  We'll continue with Kevin Smith and Dr. Ian Smith.  Is that two Smiths in the studio?  Two Smiths.  Yeah.  I just realized that.  Oh, dear.  More on the way.  All right. 
[03:18:30]  We're back with Kevin Smith and Dr. Ian Smith from Celebrity Pit Club.  Hey, what happens to these celebrities after the show?  Well, I got to tell you, Gary Busey from last season.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in the gym working out Upper East Side.  My phone rings the LA number.  It's Gary Busey.  And the guy is like, won't get off the phone.  I mean, I love Gary, but I'm like, dude, I'm working out.  He starts getting emotional. 
[03:19:00]  So I'm like, I moved to the corner because I don't want to sound like some wimp having  this emotional conversation.  And the guy looks great.  He lost all that weight.  He's kept it all off.  And he now works for the Today Show.  Tonight Show as a correspondent.  He's a frigging lunatic.  Yeah, but see, let me tell you something.  The difference between him and Jeff Conway, he's a good lunatic.  Yeah.  Like Gary had all those accidents and he recovered and half his head was gone.  And he just, you know, he just loved the world.  I would call him colorful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  He doesn't mean any harm.  He doesn't mean any harm.  I met Gary Busey years ago.  I was opening for Dice and Gary Busey showed up and I met him in the dressing room and I 
[03:19:30]  wanted to meet him.  He put his arm around me and he told me the same joke three times and he tickled me.  He's a fucking man's man and he tickled me and he hurt me.  And I just kept laughing every time he told the same joke.  I'm like, ha ha, good one.  That's Busey.  That's Busey.  I wish he was there when Jeff was doing his speech.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  Because he said to me, Dr. Ian, if I was there, I would have snapped his sternum.  That's his favorite move.  I would have snapped his sternum.  He's an old football player.  So why didn't you guys keep Jeff Conway on there?  Because that's the type of shit I love in my reality.  I know.  I know.  Just keep it as real as possible. 
[03:20:00]  But the guy, honestly, the guy is dangerous.  Like the guy was, you saw him explode on Harvey.  First of all, Harvey was going to jump over that table.  Like I physically had to restrain Harvey because he was going to.  Harvey.  Harvey.  Who's Harvey?  Harvey who?  The drill sergeant.  He's the drill sergeant.  He's the mean guy.  I'm the nice guy.  He's the mean guy.  And then he's the sexy girl.  But anyway, Harvey was going to kill him.  And so it got to the point where he had threatened so many people on the show.  He had got Harvey pissed off.  I'm worried about Harvey.  They just couldn't do it.  I just wish they would play it out. 
[03:20:30]  You know?  Like the Bonaduce show, they played it out.  It was kind of cool.  How did you see the end of that?  That was a little weird, that Bonaduce thing.  Didn't he try to kill himself or something?  Yeah, he tried to kill himself.  Harvey's shooting up steroids on the show.  I mean, they're showing him.  They showed him shooting up.  Shooting up steroids.  And what does shooting up steroids do for you?  Makes him that big, nasty animal that he tends to be.  Like Lyle Alzado.  Remember Lyle Alzado?  I mean, that's all he did.  He's a workout fiend.  So he did the steroids and all.  It made for great TV because they played it out. 
[03:21:00]  They said, all right, we'll play this out.  And what happened at the end of the show?  Hollywood ending.  He learned a lesson.  That's probably why they played it out because they knew in the end it was going to be okay.  But they'd have him at like a marriage counselor just yelling at the marriage counselor, yelling at his wife, just going crazy.  They show him, go off and start drinking again.  I used to do his shows over when the show began.  Yeah, he was clean and sober.  I used to do his show the other half when it was on.  And I got to tell you, like he was the best one because the guy would do anything.  Like he'd go way off script. 
[03:21:30]  So as a guest, you love having a host who's going to just roll with the punches, freak the script.  But that was like the man version of the view.  Right.  You were involved with that?  I used to go all the time with those guys.  They were really.  They were fun.  Jesus.  It was like the dude from Mario.  Mario.  Mario.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The dimples and all the girls loved him and blah, blah, blah.  Are you guys casting for the next season?  Right now.  We need some good.  Any names?  They're looking at this guy.  You may not know him.  This big black dude, a bone crusher.  He's a rapper.  He's got like crazy hair. 
[03:22:00]  Like if you saw him, he's very.  Was he in Bone Cucks of Harmony or something?  I think so.  I think he's one of those groups, but he was like, he's huge.  He's like bigger than Bazaar, I think.  So they're looking at him and I don't know.  They're kind of, they keep it close to the vet.  Patrice O'Neal say no?  Because Patrice, as funny as Patrice, I'm not even shitting on him.  I mean, he would be hilarious on any one.  Yeah, I agree.  He would never.  Oh, you know who else?  Carney Wilson, I think, they're trying to talk to.  Did she wait again?  She lost a lot of weight.  She did.  She was like the first one, the big celebrity to have the surgery.  But, you know, here's a mistake people make. 
[03:22:30]  They think that that surgery is going to cure them forever.  Right.  No way.  If you don't change what you eat and exercise, you're going to gain it back.  She gained a lot of weight.  But Kev had the surgery.  Yeah.  You did?  He used to be 600 pounds or close to it.  Yep.  Are you?  No, you guys.  No bullshit.  No bullshit.  He's down to what?  3?  280.  280 now.  From 600.  Yeah, but did you change your stuff, though?  Had to, right?  Yeah, he changed it.  Ah, that mic's not on there.  Ah, mic ain't working.  Eric, put that on or I'll smash you.  Now it's on.  Okay.  It's, uh, yeah, I'm down to about 280.  I had to change some of my eating habits, obviously. 
[03:23:00]  But, I mean, overall, I didn't make an entirely drastic change.  But do you exercise?  Yeah, but not any more or less frequently than I did when I weighed 600 pounds.  But see, most people at 600 aren't exercising.  They're just sitting around in the bed.  Yeah, did you work out?  Yeah, I walked to the end table.  No, this guy could move.  When he was 600, he could still move.  Wow.  We did a celebrity softball game and the guy could move.  Oh, my God, right?  Remember what you do?  What do you do here?  Uh-oh, whatever I'm told.  He hangs out.  Uh-oh, he's your guest. 
[03:23:30]  Fine guests like Kevin Smith.  He just had the surgery where he had the skin removed, the excess skin.  Did you?  I didn't know that part, really.  What is that called?  Which apparently is one of the most dangerous friggin' surgeries you could have.  I got three I'm dying calls from Kev where it was like, well, this is it, bro.  The priest has come in and it's like-  Yeah, it was that complicated.  So they took off extra skin like the stuff that's left over.  Yeah.  Wow.  The problem-  How long has the men done something like that?  It wasn't very long except for the fact that I was severely complicated, so- 
[03:24:00]  But the problem with that is that when you do something like that, you ruin your electrolytes.  Like, your body has a balance of chemicals and stuff, and when you do something like  that, take that much stuff off, you throw your body into, like, it gets haywire, and  so it seems like, oh, what's the big deal?  They're chopping skin off, but then your internal chemistry is all messed up.  I mean, that's-  Wow, congratulations, man.  I mean-  That's true.  They had to readjust my chemistry, so-  Yeah.  Congratulations.  I mean, whoa.  Old change per stomach.  That's it.  Yeah.  I mean, people-  On my diet, I mean, I'm trying to help people before they get to your point.  I mean, obviously, at 600 pounds, you probably had some medical complications, too, like diabetes 
[03:24:30]  or high blood pressure.  No, I had nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing.  I didn't even have sore joints or anything.  What brought you-  What led you to the surgery, then?  Because I knew that-  Wow.  You know, I was entering my 30s or in my 30s, and I knew that eventually it was going  to catch up with me, so I had to do something about it.  So it was more preventative than anything else.  Right.  And I was diagnosed with certain intestinal problems, and so this was a good solution  for a lot of things.  I remember the first time I went to get my throat checked, because I had tonsillitis, 
[03:25:00]  and the doctor used the term morbid obesity, and I was like, what's that?  Oh, my God.  What does that mean?  And he was just like, well, you're overweight to a dangerous, potentially dangerous place.  Wow.  Had no idea that that term existed.  Horrible when somebody says morbid obesity.  Obesity is bad enough, but when it shot past unpleasant and landed on morbid, it's like  all that's left is creepy obesity.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to the phones there.  Creepy.  Jeff in Pennsylvania.  Jeff. 
[03:25:30]  Hi, ONA.  Hey.  Little Jimmy.  What's up, man?  Kevin, love your movies.  Thank you.  Dr. Ian, I'm a trucker.  I was in the military.  I weighed 180.  Now I'm like 290, and I was wondering if there's anything you can do, like for truckers  specifically that could help them, you know, lose some weight.  Yeah.  I've had, actually I had like five or six truckers email me who are doing well on the diet now.  I mean, it's just that, you know, I can't obviously explain the whole diet to you on  air, but if you get the book, my email's on the back of the book. 
[03:26:00]  You can email me.  I mean, I really try to help people.  So, it's the fatsmashdiet.com, fatsmashdiet.com, and I can definitely help you.  I mean, you know, but you got to work.  You know what the problem is?  People want to lose weight, but they're not ready to lose weight.  Like Countess Vaughn from the show, she wasn't ready.  She shouldn't have been there, you know?  And instead, she's crying.  She wasn't ready.  So, dude, I mean, if you're ready, I mean, get the book and email me.  Yeah, I definitely want to get back, you know, when I was in the military and shaping  everything, but I find it real hard driving 11 hours a day, and I'm just really tired. 
[03:26:30]  I got you, man.  Seriously.  Email me.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  What kind of weird country has America become, man, where it's like truckers used to call into  radio shows and be like, I need a pocket now.  Yeah.  I'm on a job on the road, and now they're like, how do I lose weight?  We're men in this country.  What do you got today, John?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, Kevin, I live over in Hadley, not too far from where you used to.  Right on.  The Hazard Multiplex.  I used to know that. 
[03:27:00]  And when I first moved over here, man, I went into the store, because, you know, the  clerk's store, and I got to tell you, you were right, but the guy got wigged out on me,  because I thought, you know, being a tool at 32 years old, nothing to do, and going to  check out the clerk's store.  He just was like, you got to buy something or leave.  Just get out.  I got other things going on, and I got to tell you.  I love the attention.  That amazes me.  Is the lot still empty in front?  The lot, right across the street, still wide open.  Still wide open?  Well, what is wrong with that area that that hasn't been built on?  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  And real estate in that area is pretty inexpensive, too. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Like, pretty darn inexpensive.  Hey, by the way, you were right about Jersey Girl.  In what way?  You said last year, when the boys interviewed you on the phone, that, you know, a lot of  people checked it out after a while.  You know, it wasn't that bad.  And, you know, really, I mean, it's a chick flick.  Total chick flick.  It's kind of like a guilty pleasure, but it was actually a pretty good movie overall.  Oh, I appreciate that, sir.  Thank you.  You did a great job in clerks of framing those two establishments because there's so much  more to that building.  Yeah, there's a lot more.  And I absolutely thought it was just the convenience store and the video store. 
[03:28:00]  I got my, like, first and second tattoo there.  And then there was a place at the very end that used to be a series of rotating restaurants.  Like, a restaurant would come in, like a diner, you know, grill, and they would leave within  a year.  And then finally, this obedience school took it over.  And I don't know, or a fighting school.  We're not sure whether it's dog training or if it's, like, some kind of people, like,  fighting training.  Because they have, like, a pit bull, like, drawing with a fucking mask on on their sign 
[03:28:30]  out front.  Yeah.  You never hear dogs, and it just looks like people learn some kind of fighting style.  It could be either, yeah.  Hey, we got 30 seconds left in the show.  Ah, damn it.  We're on a master computer.  They just shut us down after the show.  So, Dr. Ian Smith, thanks from Celebrity Fit Club.  Hey, guys.  It's great.  I got on DVR.  I'm going to watch the final episode when I get home from this.  Cool.  Cool.  Thanks.  I love the show, so continued success.  And Kevin Smith, what can we say?  And Kevin, thanks so much for coming in.  Oh, thanks for having me in.  I didn't gush, but I swear to you, you are huge to me. 
[03:29:00]  I'm a huge fan.  Thanks for having me.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Ron and Fez up next.  Thanks, guys.  That's it.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here. </pre>
