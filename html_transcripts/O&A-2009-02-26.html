<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with Opie describing his water-damaged Blackberry and the ineffectiveness of the rice remedy, sparking a discussion about technological dependence and the shift from phone calls to texting.  This led to a tangent on *Lost*, specifically Jimmy's accurate prediction of Walt's return, further punctuated by listener calls regarding water-damaged phones and the rice method's debatable efficacy.  The conversation then jumped to Twitter’s pervasive use, even during important events, followed by a discussion of a photo of Opie, Anthony, and 50 Cent, and the ensuing racist online commentary about a comment Opie made about 50 Cent's intelligence. The photo's poor quality was also debated.  The hosts then excitedly discussed the growing popularity of the FattyRock.com website, showcasing photoshopped images of a fat man's body with various heads.

The show continued with a discussion about Tiger Woods’ return to golf, followed by vehement criticism of Michael Bloomberg's plan to restrict traffic in Times Square.  The hosts expressed considerable frustration about the inconvenience this would cause, extending the discussion to include commentary on pedestrian behavior and NYC congestion.  The broadcast then shifted to a discussion of the Antique Roadshow, followed by a recounting of the hosts' own unusual possessions – a Nazi officer's cap and a pickled punk.  This bizarre collection prompted a listener call about wanting to display his preserved head after death, similar to Ted Williams' cryopreservation, and ended with a brief mention of the Mütter Museum and its collection of medical oddities.

A subsequent segment focused on the “Body Exhibit,” with descriptions of its macabre displays, such as a preserved vascular system and a pregnant woman's body.  The hosts and a 13-year-old caller, JC, shared their reactions and observations. This led to a humorous discussion about astrology and birth signs, followed by a surprisingly detailed discussion about the hosts' and callers’ conceptions, including their parents’ marital timelines and conception dates.  A call from Wheeze about his unafraid approach to death and his desire for his skull to be displayed after death, triggered a conversation about Bill Maher, the hosts’ differing political views, political correctness, and a detailed anecdote about a caller apologizing for comments about Jerry Lewis.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a news story about "Drunken Negro Face" cookies and the ensuing controversy, involving local officials and the Secret Service.  The hosts debated the government's role in addressing such issues, touching upon freedom of speech and the potential overreach of government intervention.  Multiple callers engaged in heated debate with the hosts, particularly regarding the government's role in regulating speech and thought.  This discussion continued throughout the segment.

Another segment began with a caller's comments about taxes and wealth redistribution, sparking a debate about government programs and the Obama administration's budget.  This involved discussion of earmarks and lack of press access to Guantanamo Bay, interspersed with comedic tangents about tattoo removal funding, a listener's brother's inappropriate behavior, and media polarization.  A caller then discussed his struggles in the real estate business before the conversation switched to music, with crude descriptions of songs by Puscifer and the Ting Tings.  The show featured a lengthy discussion of a guest's new "MyVu" glasses, punctuated by technical difficulties and humorous banter.  A significant portion was dedicated to the mystery of a missing pair of "MyVu" glasses intended for giveaways, leading to accusations and speculation amongst the hosts and staff.

The latter part of this segment introduced Pat from Munaki, a caller with significant financial and health problems (diabetes). The hosts engaged in a lengthy conversation about Pat's life, job, housing, and unsuccessful application to "The Biggest Loser," interspersed with jokes, listener calls offering support and job offers.  This segment was meant to conclude with an interview with author Dick Russell about his book on the JFK assassination, but was cut short by a break.

The final segment featured the interview with Dick Russell, discussing his book *On the Trail of the JFK Assassins*.  The conversation focused on conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination, including multiple shooters, the "magic bullet," and alleged alterations to the autopsy. Russell detailed his investigations, mentioning interviews and claims of cover-ups.  The discussion also touched upon the Zapruder film and mysterious deaths connected to his research.  The hosts interjected with jokes, referencing *JFK* and other pop culture moments. The segment concluded with a Carbonite advertisement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  it's the opian anthony show opian anthony radio shock job opian anthony  and we're off and running good morning with the opian anthony show good morning i don't know why  but i i woke up drove him yep got in the elevator yep all that time until kenny said  well one more day i thought it was wednesday really even though you know lost is on a wednesday 
[00:00:30]  i watched it but then for some reason i got up this morning thinking it was wednesday again  isn't that a nice treat for you it is so it's a whole day just gone there you go you just did  some uh traveling into the future my friend how does it feel a little time travel a little time  travel great no delorean necessary it's nice right it was very nice but uh yeah so happy uh thursday  whatever you want to call it i uh i i burnt down my blackberry last night how's that and the only 
[00:01:00]  reason i mentioned this i was shaving and i i decided that the blackberry needed to be on the  sink and i'm splashing water around to clean out the sink because it has all the uh the beard hair  whiskers because i was growing my my my facial hair for a while for whatever reason yeah i'm pretty  grabbing myself and uh next thing you know i see the thing just did you see a little puff not really  but it just kind of just phased out fizzled on you and then i uh i dried it for a while and then i 
[00:01:30]  turned it upside down and let it dry i mean and then i put the battery back in and then as it's like  charging up i hear it's not good so i turn it off again and uh let it sit all night long turn it on  this morning and uh done done done done so then i i bitched to one of the bosses because i'm supposed  to get a new phone hooked up and he goes well i was reading this is the only reason i'm telling the  story by the way uh i was reading an article the other day if you spill anything on your blackberry 
[00:02:00]  what you should do is to you know put it in a bunch of rice that's not cooked yet to soak up the  fluids i'm thinking to myself that works when you're in a restaurant and you want to keep the  salt from clumping up yeah and how is that going to dry out a blackberry that got some water splashed  on it and then was that a real article i think so come on there's no way that would work because i  mean the water gets into the you know it got in the top crannies like i didn't even see where the 
[00:02:30]  water went yeah the battery was dry as could be what were you rinsing out your sink with a fire  hose i don't know what uh i'm the stupidest man alive it's like i do the dumbest thing little little  splashes got on it like little droplets i guess and that did it i saw just a little water on the top  so i just like dabbed it with the towel and then all of a sudden it just started uh phasing out damn  yeah so uh the only reason i bring it up this rice trick does that work with with electronics 
[00:03:00]  i doubt it i don't like that you get those little silica gel packs yeah and dump it in in a big thing  of those what do you got stuff right according to uh blackberry geeks.com yeah yeah they say one of  the things aside from being tempted to take a blow dryer they say don't do that stick that oh see i was  going to do that well it doesn't matter it's not working stick that baby in a container of rice 
[00:03:30]  rice absorbs the moisture the idea is that it'll suck the moisture out but you wait 48 hours before  you put the battery in that's you do have to wait a long time when electronics get water on them  you got to be patient so you think there's a shot that this thing will dry you know you probably fried  it by putting the battery in well the thing fires up and i see the screen for like a split second  it says i have mail a couple phone calls and then it just goes black again so you gotta like teasing  me you gotta take care of business in three seconds no how about a third of a second all your all your 
[00:04:00]  crap you gotta do like yeah a quarter second and it's it's weird not having a phone in the year 2009  i feel completely lost i have your stuff synced up on your computer oh why would i do that  why would anyone do that are you kidding but no all my cards are fine everything's fine the battery  never got wet my cards never got wet it's just the buttons on the top some water got in there and  then fried out the screen oh you could just take the card from that one and put it in all right okay 
[00:04:30]  oh okay then you're then you're fine or it looks like i can sync it up to a computer and get my stuff  off it's not like the phone is completely dead the screen just won't go on yeah so but not having a  phone is how weird is that when was the last time you you didn't have a phone i i forgot my phone um  at the house when i was driving into work one day yeah and i got like three blocks away and you're in  a complete panic right i i like was filling my pockets i was ah i turned around went back to the 
[00:05:00]  house and i got it but for the for those three blocks yeah uh i didn't know what to do yeah yeah we  are lost without a little gadgetry that keeps us in touch with everybody and i instantly and  and i saved my pebble because i'm i'm on silent right now yeah because i forgot i saved my pebble  because i'm constantly doing this i'm either i mean i just told the story i lost my phone remember  that's the same phone now i've had it three weeks and now i fried it out with the water  so i got the pebble and it's just so foreign to me it's like a phone that just takes phone calls 
[00:05:30]  and maybe we'll text people i know that's ridiculous yeah i need to check out some websites i need  to do i can't tweet on a pebble no are you crazy how are you gonna take pictures of people and post  it up there i'm not gonna i'm i'm out for a while so i'm out for a day or two fellow tweeters you think  i'm bad with the tweeting there's a story of a surgeon who wants to tweet during an operation  and i just got uh some audio during obama's speech all the lawmakers they they couldn't be 
[00:06:00]  bothered listening to obama they're tweeting like crazy in the middle of the tweet that whole speech  as he's doing his speech yes to their followers boy that's got to be some fun reading huh  a representative or a congressman tweeting to his followers  awful harumph harumph how do you spell harumph uh hold on let me  all right sorry uh david in kansas city what's up morning guys hey my mom dropped her phone in 
[00:06:30]  the toilet the other day and i put it in a bowl of rice for two days and dried it right out put the  battery back in and it's just fine so i got a shot at this thing working it works the rice is so dry  that it just you know it draws the moisture out of everything really so it does work all right  maybe i should i throw it in some rice for a while no it's too late now you've already turned  it on and oh i shouldn't have turned it on oh you heated the water up when you plugged it into the  electronics oh i sure did because i heard it going you can't you can't do anything you can't you can't 
[00:07:00]  do anything until after you've already dried it you can't power it back on until it's been dried out  so it's probably smoked all right man thanks yep so now i got a phone that makes phone calls that's so  that's so stupid yeah that's ridiculous no apps no email no website browsing you've you've been  no picture taken thrown back into the past yeah you're thrown back into the past that's uh 
[00:07:30]  yeah i can't even deal with that in this day and age the other thing i was thinking um you know that  i haven't made a phone call on my blackberry in weeks really i'll i'll communicate with it yeah  by you know writing email and uh and text messages but to actually dial a number that's  stupid who does that with their phone these days they don't just take the keys off like that the  phone they might as well are you noticing you barely use it as an actual phone i text only when 
[00:08:00]  stunty calls me well yeah it's it's it always has to be there's only a couple of calls i take yeah  like like boss phone calls that's it even family members you know bob eatman yeah um that i like the  people that call you and then um you know either i don't pick up or or oops i'm sorry i missed the  call yeah uh and then they don't leave a voicemail they just text me what they were going to say  just do that in the first place yeah there's no need to call me yeah and i i like the extra text or 
[00:08:30]  email that goes back and forth someone tells you something thanks and they write and you go thanks  i guess because you want to acknowledge that they did something for you and then they have to write  back no problem yeah np or something and then it forces you to do something next thing you know  there's like three or four different exchanges you never had to do yeah you feel a little  vibrate in your pocket you're like oh what new text and it's just like okay i assumed you got that  and said okay because we had talked about it and well i wasted too much time on my dumb phone thing i was 
[00:09:00]  lost it's all about lost well um i i just was amazed that jimmy is a psychic why what happened jimmy is a  psychic well you know watching lost is a big community event and um i was on pal talk uh um  there's a lost room yeah i'll talk and uh so i was in the little lost room and and uh then walt  shows up for the first time in and like a year he's not been on the show but yesterday jimmy went 
[00:09:30]  on a rant about lost which was nothing short of genius ben driving the island down manhattan  yeah that was the funny part when you said that jimmy's a genius and and he called it i'm like  what they actually drove an island yeah they drove the island down uh middle of manhattan yeah  but uh no they they show walt um coming out of a school or something and and lock is there he's 
[00:10:00]  across the street he's he's in a wheelchair again because he's back uh you know on regular time off  the island so i guess fate has to step in and make him not be able to walk he broke his leg yeah you'll  see it and then uh he waves to walt they show walt and he's like 30 years old he's like  hey john how you doing what up does he acknowledge how old he is everywhere no he just says you got 
[00:10:30]  hey you got big you know but uh everybody in the room is just like oh my god jimmy is a psychic  he completely called this one and the thing was we had no one had seen walt in in quite a long time  on the show and you just talking about him that episode there he is well he was in one episode i  saw in like season three or four yeah yeah where they show his silhouette in the window uh-huh and  he's obviously just on on on leave from the military i mean he got too big that's the problem when you 
[00:11:00]  cast the kid yeah you better make sure you shoot a lot of his stuff uh quickly it's with that show  especially with a flashing backwards and flashing forwards and and things like that you can't do a  flashback with with walt because he's just too big amazing yeah couldn't have gotten another kid that  looks like walt i know yeah why not and then just throw it into the storyline somehow what's rodney  allen rippy doing probably still looks like a kid right sure uh vince just doesn't get it from bayonne 
[00:11:30]  new jersey uh op you're a millionaire you lost uh a blackberry go to the store and pick up a new one  you whiner oh there you go well i i have a blackberry that i bought two to three weeks ago  i want to be on the corporate email system because i do a lot of work through my blackberry  it's like it's like uh going through the csi or or whatever yeah let's csi wait wait it's impossible 
[00:12:00]  to get this thing hooked up without paperwork and approval from this guy and that guy because  they only get cratic right crap they uh yeah they will give you phones yeah so you could get  corporate email but they're crappy phones they're older versions of the blackberry i love the blackberry  so i got the brand new one that literally came out two weeks ago it's been sitting in a box this  blackberry is almost too old now i think there's going to be a new one coming out by the time i get this 
[00:12:30]  hooked up those things that get dated in uh days and and there's some weird thing where like no we  can't uh hook up your new blackberry to the system sorry only the phones that we approve which are  older phones i'm like that is crazy in this day and age when we're in the communication business  you should allow anyone to have the latest phone and just hook it up to the system they want their  phone so they could slip the little bug in there right so they had to change everything everything  you say they had to change everything they had to like make new like rules and laws just to get  my phone hooked up and i sit here and still wait does it have a sporty monochrome screen yeah pretty 
[00:13:00]  much pretty much uh scroll scroll let's say hi to marcos marcos hey what's up boy hey buddy  what's going on no i was gonna say that uh i had lost my phone i was without a phone for three days  and i had to make a really important call and i was outside in the street and dude it was like  impossible to find a pay phone i don't even know they exist these days there's one pay phone 
[00:13:30]  apparently in front of the xm facility oh really yeah it's been there you know forever i guess i  didn't even notice that it's there that's like the only one i've seen in all of manhattan yeah  all right sir but what are you gonna do make a phone call put some change in please deposit 25  cents right for the next three minutes what approximately 50 cents right now well see  see how long 50 cents i would know i remember when it was a dime pay phones take me out of movies old 
[00:14:00]  movies because it's so weird to see like a king of comedy when dinero's at the pay phone yeah and he  makes a call and now he needs uh what's his name to call him back and he's and he's hanging out at  the pay phone all day waits and waits and there's a line of people waiting to use the phone and they're  all mad it just takes me out of the mood i'm like that's so weird like that everyone would have cell  phones that obviously now pay phones are just uh outdoor urinals for the homeless yes that's pretty  much what they are right now uh and it's the only good they're they're there for yeah remember the 
[00:14:30]  actual phone booth with that wacky door that you had like squeezed through squeezed through and  yeah the actual phone booth it kind of felt good when you were able to finally close that door  though i don't know what that was about because you felt all like private yeah and and you were out  of the wind and and the traffic sounds and things like that yeah i kind of liked the phone booth  although when those things got used as a bathrooms they just stunk forever forever and they actually had 
[00:15:00]  a phone book hang in there a little phone book would be hanging in there so you could look things up  oh really yeah so you could clean yourself up after yeah exactly i had to use the b section to uh  wipe with did you all right we're just getting started everyone wants to talk about phones it  was just a dumb quick thing uh uh well kent the movie guy he knows a little something about 
[00:15:30]  movies and tv shows what do you got on this loss there kent well uh now that brought walt back it's  actually kind of perfect timing because for everybody off the island it's been a few years  yeah he's actually now this age he should be technically yeah the thing is he looks 10 years  older it's supposed to be three years going by he looks 10 years old because i guess when he was a  kid he's was probably a little older than um than he was supposed to be on the show i think he was 
[00:16:00]  12 playing 10 something yeah something like that that was a bad move so now he's 15  playing like playing a linebacker 13 oh really yeah waltz getting a little big  you know i was gonna watch loss last night yeah just to try to catch up like instantly and then  just come in and try to tell you what i know about the show that would be interesting just popping  in now and seeing all right even fathom it all right i'll do that next week i haven't seen one 
[00:16:30]  episode try and check it out on uh try and check it out on g4 uh when they do reruns on there because  they put up little factoids they got the people who are trying to catch up they are they are amazing  brilliant at what they have done on uh abc as far as lost goes because from eight till nine they play  the previous week's episode but they have like a pop-up video kind of thing where at the bottom of the  screen it pops up and says this guy like you see somebody on the screen go this guy you might  remember from episode uh two of season two oh wow he did this this this so it kind of fills you in 
[00:17:00]  if you were confused last week on who the people are and then the new episode plays and the ratings  are great for it people like i just watched the episode last week but i again watched the eight  o'clock version you want to read the factoids right factoids on who's who and who's doing what  great idea you're you're actually watching two hours of lost uh on abc they're getting the the whole  slot from eight o'clock till uh 10 o'clock i would do that for any show that i'm in yeah any show that 
[00:17:30]  i saw the week prior i would re-watch if they did that no problem just if they had just dumb little  pop-ups and factoids because there were a couple of instances during last night's first run episode  right where i was looking at someone and going is this significant who's this person right and i'm  just like i'll just watch it next week i know they'll pop some stuff up and say hey this guy was  from this and you might have seen him pop up that's all this situation uh exactly matches what 
[00:18:00]  happened in the pilot episode and you know you notice in general that tv's starting to figure it  out a little bit just a couple that's a great example and uh cnn especially they're using i'll  say it again the tweeter but they're also using the facebook their guys will be on tv talking about  obama speech or whatever and then they go to their own facebook and like and all these people are now  get involved with their uh their program they're they're finally starting to figure out that the  whole media world is changing integrating uh personal electronic media right uh with their their 
[00:18:30]  news programs it it involves uh the general population sure you could get information faster  that way pictures even videos things like that right i mean there was video of of people involved with  uh sully's little water landing right after it happened well they got something on cnn i think  it's called the i report yeah it's called the i report you you sign up for it and now we're all  walking around with our camera phones right and let's say you saw that plane crash or the aftermath 
[00:19:00]  you you're taking 10 15 second video you send it right to the cnn uh uh website and then they show  which videos they've actually uh shown on cnn uh brilliant yeah it is because now you're like  everyone's hoping to get a little fame who we can we're all looking at our facebook seeing how many  friends we added and all this crap and and and and some of these videos are are go from camera phone  right onto cnn yeah and that person's like look they used my video how cool is that it on yeah i actually 
[00:19:30]  signed up for that but i haven't seen anything cool nothing cool to uh that's the problem no one wants  to see voss without his teeth right cnn i'm gonna oh yeah this yeah watch this dolt with no teeth  i'm a member of that but you have to see the news happen yeah they don't want like video of like  pedestrians in new york city who cares but if something cool happens and you happen to get a  little video and throw it up there you got a shot at you're ready international exposure my friend

[00:23:30]  grab the black face or the white face and focus on it yeah and we're so different complexion wise  yeah he's i'm lighter that works maybe that's what happened with this picture maybe that's all  it is you can absolutely do that in photoshop adjust i don't know how to do it levels it's pretty easy  the camera might have got really confused because of uh finnie's face and our faces and that's a  pretty good uh my pants messed it up too that's a pretty good picture my pants aren't in my picture  though i think they're only in your picture damn it uh some of the comments ha ha ha and silly uh

[00:27:30]  some people um don't get the uh the gist of it and just throw some wacky picture and and there's  fatty rock on there but some people really know what picture to choose to really immerse fatty rock  into the photo and make it make sense let me ask you can you do this can you because the fatty rock is  just him holding his bosoms can you reverse that and have him instead of head cocks left or whatever  have it be head cocks right and this way you open up more photos you could possibly put in it danny and 
[00:28:00]  i were talking about that on tuesday and we hope that uh that he can make an update to this website  you're hoping they're listening at fatty rock.com yeah you know the staff at fatty rock.com i know  they're very busy yeah but maybe in the update we can have like a reversal i believe the easier  thing to do at the time now would be to reverse the photo you're using and that way he'd be looking at  it there you go also the other the other thing about the fat e-rock picture is that no matter  what size your picture is the fat e-rock picture is still the same size right so if you have a small 
[00:28:30]  picture the fat e-rock is going to take up 75 percent of that big giant in it yeah so you gotta you gotta  choose the right uh size choose wisely i just saw one that just said fat not lost and it was the lost  uh poster or whatever so all right we gotta take a break oh fatty rock phones are lit i we're gonna  blow off the phone conversation whatever just a little observation 877-212-0&a i saw what i saw 
[00:29:00]  you getting mad over there jimmy i knew that one would bother you did you know which one i was reading  yeah and i i gotta tell you i think six months ago i called this i think about six months ago i said  this very thing would happen i hate oh yeah i was thinking remember it yep thank you i said i thought it  would take a little longer but it it's going to be a reality in a few months we'll explain next opie  and anthony good morning to everybody it's the ona show jimmy's outraged why are you outraged that 
[00:29:30]  tiger woods is back playing golf that's crazy it's a racial thing i said i wanted to be white people  it's a white sport and it's fun for old white people i know you guys aren't the only thing i like  about golf i know you guys aren't golf fans but uh this is exciting news that tiger's back it's on the  front page of one of the uh rags here in new york uh today and then and what were you telling me  on the target what's the thing he won his first match they're doing match play you know you play  one guy at a time right until there's only one guy standing and uh he's looking good for his bracket 
[00:30:00]  he took it uh three and two but he really was dominating in the first in the first half then he  kind of had uh tied him up and then just coasted after the 15th hole there's nothing better than on a  lazy sunday afternoon just kind of sitting on the couch doing mundane stuff checking your email  with a little laptop and watching tiger woods play watching some golf is very relaxing yeah it's very  okay boogie and the ratings were horrific without tiger woods last eight months oh yeah the swing 
[00:30:30]  looks good very smooth the swing looks very smooth that's good only thing interesting about golf is  tiger woods the only interesting thing about it yeah he needs a couple guys uh to really challenge  i mean then it would be a lot more fun just the monster on the golf course but that's not what  jimmy's mad at no it's the broadway car band yes which is annoying me almost as much as eric's sketch  camera what did eric want to do he's got a plinstone's camera dude it's horrendous a little bird inside  that just chisels it out chiseling out the photos um yeah this this bloomberg we all knew he was a 
[00:31:00]  liberal uh you know he's just gotten the republican ticket because i think the democrats he couldn't  get on their ticket or whatever it was but uh he is acting like a spoiled uh out-of-touch billionaire  again with the traffic and it's like sorry dickhead new york oh wow i like it sure though he is  he's he's a baby and it's like sorry mike that we all have to drive to get around the city he wants 
[00:31:30]  to close down uh time square to to vehicular traffic yep so it will be open just to pedestrian  traffic and uh it i might i was clenching my jaws reading this while you guys were just talking the  opening break i might i was clenching my jaws i saw that because i drive all over to get the spots  infuriating of course it's infuriating that uh he's shutting down all these major roadways  for just pedestrians to put up tables chair like you're like you're hanging out uh in the middle 
[00:32:00]  of a road well this is where we live we need places to hang out anthony there's plenty of parks  look at central park it's giant you're one of those tunnel and bridge uh folks oh please you know  something get these goddamn uh enough pedestrians on the roads their roads you drive on where are we  supposed to hang out anthony we're supposed to drive i'll tell you where the sidewalks they take up  all the roads i'm just gonna drive more on the sidewalks can you acknowledge that i said this  was gonna happen six to eight months ago oh yeah people called me crazy but when i was walking 
[00:32:30]  through time square that well i'm working on it trust me uh when uh when uh when you go through  time square they start expanding the sidewalks into the street and i went ah ah i know where this is  leading let me tell what is this happening jimmy i believe memorial day started to the experimental  period of time but this idiot bloomberg and he is an idiot traffic driving through there  is is gonna do nothing so you're gonna tell me that people are gonna get out at seventh avenue or 
[00:33:00]  whatever and walk in the rain and the cold you dummy yeah you're hurting businesses there and also  at three o'clock in the morning you tell me i can't just drive through do you know how awful that's  gonna be at three o'clock in the morning no the lifeblood of like traffic and cabs and stuff going  through what a dummy he is but he's not worried about me he's not worried about the three a.m.ers  there jimmy you don't care about you three a.m.ers and i think it was uh ant said uh that he his  traffic plan didn't get approved yes his his basic traffic plan that he came up with uh about a year 
[00:33:30]  ago didn't get approved this is the one where he wanted to limit uh traffic that was coming in in the  city um between uh i guess it was 60th and 30 something i don't even know what the streets were but  midtown he if you were gonna drive into midtown he wanted you to pay a lot of money uh double if  you're a truck uh and it didn't pass and he has since gone into a little temper tantrum and decided 
[00:34:00]  all right you didn't pass that i'm gonna first of all uh make up my own rules so i can have a third  term and then uh i'll just start taking your roads away is he did he get the third term or no is he  gonna run well yeah he's working on it it went through i mean the he can run yep who's running  against him it's great it's cool he didn't want to do that when rudy was here after 9-11 and we  actually wanted rudy to stay yeah yeah but uh do it for yourself so you can close off uh car traffic 
[00:34:30]  in broadway so more people can walk that's good he has enough personal funding to campaign against  anybody when uh the election finally happens uh who's who's going to compete against that i don't  know he's going to go out on little fundraisers and trying to get money when this guy's got  a war chest of billions and billions of dollars that he can spend on his re-election campaign  i think i think it's going to help the businesses in times square how is that going to help it like  telling you it's raining have you guys been down there like trying to drive through there's a 
[00:35:00]  nightmare because there's so many effing people already it is congested but you know what it's  not gonna hurt businesses i don't think who's gonna want to walk with packages it's like this is all for  the tourists that whole area is just a tourist trap but new yorkers don't really hang out there  and what happens about crosstown are you gonna be able to cross over broadway yeah uh they'll they have  you just can't drive down broadway correct so in between all of the uh uh uh streets  uh that's where people are gonna be able to hang out and and lounge around and walk around they're 
[00:35:30]  talking like eight blocks and then seventh is going to be open wider so this is going to be  where you're going to be able to what about the crossover seven the broadway what a mess that's  going to be with people walking well down broadway and then you're how are you going to get your car  through i'm sure they'll have cops there oh please it's going to be terrible also they have the cop  that just does this a disaster it's gonna be like a street fair every day yeah first of all the 
[00:36:00]  pedestrians don't know how to stay on a mother effing sidewalk right i have been in in uh the left lane  of a three-lane road here in manhattan which is hysterical because the other two lanes are taken up  by parking and sometimes the middle lane by double parking but when uh you get to an intersection and i  want to make a left yeah and there are pedestrians standing in that left lane looking waiting for the  the sign to change so they could walk and meanwhile i'm trying to make the turn someone stopped in the 
[00:36:30]  uh in the uh middle lane because they can't get across the intersection but i'm turning so i'm fine  and they will walk right out beep beep i cannot lean on my horn hard enough and then i drive through  with my windshield washers on and my wipers at full blast and splash them with washer fluid it's the  most fun thing to do jimmy because i'll tell you i love the escalates power wash window uh washer and it 
[00:37:00]  even has a button where you could heat it up so they get hit with hot cleaning fluid in their face  it's fantastic you gotta tap them no no no i won't tap them you gotta tap them yeah maybe years years  ago before they could you know rape me but uh now i just like hitting them with a little hot uh  windshield washer fluid but what happened i think the pedestrians uh just took over that area  they started walking in the streets and uh you know that's good because if it's raining or snowing 
[00:37:30]  or windy and freezing cold yeah i'm walking yeah no one's gonna want to walk well their goal is to  make it really hard to own a car in new york city simple as that they're gonna want you to use the  mass transit and uh stay away from time square in these other areas but it's new york it's it is a  major city and this fruit is acting like it's venice hey dummy there are cars here um i'm sorry but it's  if you have to cut down on certain things at certain times what that's one thing but to 
[00:38:00]  completely ban it is just the sign of a guy who can take the subway at all hours because he has  state trooper bodyguards with him and this is the sign of a guy who if he needs to get through  can get through anywhere anytime with a motorcade and cop he can do that we can't do that and it's  out of touch fruit billionaire then explain where i could hang out as a new yorker central park  it gets boring after a while now f the apartment i can't walk out of my apartment and get some fresh 
[00:38:30]  air there are plenty of parks i need to i need an outdoor cafe and a little table and a little chair  and i could sit there and people watch and drink my my my my cappuccino plenty of that brian park  sixth avenue it is you go it's where the hbo building is instead of broadway right you go to  sixth avenue and 42nd and you got brian park yeah they do outdoor concerts there it's a giant  open air place it's got wi-fi right there for you all right there you already have that i want to  hang out on a street stunt brain writes when unemployment hits 20 it's going to be a camp 
[00:39:00]  for the homeless this uh times square you know something you're right it's just going to open  up times square the more you know when cars are driving through it's hard to set up spackle bucket  drum sets right when uh you're there's cars going there uh when when it's shut off and there's just  people hanging out it's going to be more homeless more shysters and shills dude bring back three card  monty shanty town yeah by the way and i couldn't take a picture because i was gonna look like a creep  homeless guy under uh the most horrific dirty blanket dirtiest blanket i've ever seen having sex

[00:47:00]  that person would have a heart attack on the set how great is that show though oh yeah it's the  them is guilty it's a guilty pleasure i like some of those don't disappointed yes well somebody seems  to have taken off a very important label on the back that would have made this worth thousands but  since i uh i took the label off well i thought that i was looking for maybe a name underneath the label  yes that label made it so rare and now it's worth probably three dollars and thirty cents and then 
[00:47:30]  they clunk three dollars and thirty cents and then they go on to the next dope yeah well i decided  to finish it myself is that oh you repainted it yeah really yeah because it was fading a little bit  so i decided to put a little stain on it these are in demand in their normal natural state oh i didn't  know i found these in my attic i believe they belong to my grandmother right i have i have this teddy  bear but i i i i took the arm off is that and i and then i i re-sewed it because there was oh no the

[00:55:30]  a good one too that is such a twisted place man actually that's the best museum i've ever been to  oh there was some uh woman that was buried next to a river and and and like lye from the ground and the  ground water actually transformed her body into what amounted to soap the fat in her body and the  lye and the water it was the perfect conditions and they dug her up and threw her in this museum 
[00:56:00]  yep so you're looking through a glass top coffin at at this woman soap lady made of soap yeah  i think they dubbed her soap lady so sick is that her right there everyone walks out of the museum  with clean middle finger  and the one angry guy with a clean fist  yeah oh look how horrific that is she's screaming i'm so i'm so can we have soap in my eyes 
[00:56:30]  put that up on onaradio.com absolutely it's a weird bluish color and she looks her mouth is wide  open and she looks like she is screaming that is a monster movie thing that is something that  comes after you in a monster movie in a horrifically scary movie i wonder if they've ever borrowed it  for like a movie just have that recreated maybe i think she'll uh bust apart if you kind of move  even touch her oh i'd love to punch it oh wouldn't you love to just punch it and have a lather foam 
[00:57:00]  foam up on your knuckles spray rain i'd spray water on her a bunch of melt does the mute run a big giant  soap dish to just decompose into a little sliver or wash my hiney with her i want to wash my hiney  with her head worse i want to worse worse we got a website for the muter museum it's a great museum  it was the other really sick thing in there there was a uh there was a skeleton of yeah what's that 
[00:57:30]  guy's skeleton giant colon oh yeah giant colon tumor obviously it's medical oddities mostly in this  museum it's if you're ever if you ever find yourself in the philly area you know check out  the muter museum m-u-t-t-e-r there's some weird crap in here they're like real embryos through every  like month oh right in different jars right yeah it just gave me the creeps that place so full of death  and a horror if that creeps you out don't ever go to uh what what what is it called uh with the dead 
[00:58:00]  bodies is it called dead bodies big a's house no no i think you're thinking of bodies right just  called bodies yeah bodies and don't go see the bodies exhibit then no that is amazing i've seen  pictures of it and he gives me a creep they actually this artist was able to get dead bodies and then he  poses them and and all sorts of ways to kind of show off the human form it's really weird they  pump the bodies full of polyurethane yes and then it hardens and they're able to just slice them up 
[00:58:30]  yep and do whatever they want they could take the muscles off and have the entire circulatory system  just standing there uh and and it's filled with um polyurethane i was totally cool with the bodies  exhibit until i went into this one room and there was one display in there it was a horse without its  skin on it with a guy uh in front very injured the only real the only thing left was his wrist watch 
[00:59:00]  because they were both petrified but his watch was still taking this and other there's give me the  watch there's the picture show the guys should that horse have your watch look at this right this is the  only thing they had in uh the one room a guy riding a horse uh the horse no skin so you could see all  the muscles and the bones pretty cool and and the rider same thing no skin so you could get right to  the bones and the muscle you know it's that creeped me out with the tail still intact too they take uh 
[00:59:30]  some of the muscle and they peel it back to simulate speed yeah like oh yeah you're running  well they have a sprinter like that in this exhibit i saw that like i'll look at the pictures and stuff  but i don't want to go down there i heard most of these uh skeletons like asian guys that they just  kind of you know oopsie i don't know falangong people they're questioning if these bodies are you  know were actually donated for some purpose the stories come up every every year because there's 
[01:00:00]  people trying to shut this uh it's amazing really an interesting exhibit it's amazing i think an ethics  question on on whether you know these bodies were these people's wishes right too bad you know one of  those things they didn't say i don't want to be part of the bodies exhibit so as far as i'm concerned  they're fair game okay i don't want to be part of the bodies exhibit i do you do yeah no what do  you want to be hell no sloppy party bottom exhibit no the the enlarged genital man this man actually 
[01:00:30]  walked through life with this attachment you know who you know who we should get on the phone today  brother wheeze he couldn't tell the story because he had he wasn't allowed to talk for like a year on  radio and he remember we sort of started talking about this and he was at the doorway and he was  nodding i want him to tell the story and what he wants to do with his body oh really why is it pretty  twisted should i just say it because we might not be able to get him what is it yeah he wants his  family to save his head and then display oh not the whole and display it oh i thought you meant like 
[01:01:00]  yes like a freeze it yes like ted uh ted williams can we get wheeze on for a couple minutes is that  possible display it in what after the jar we could do it for like two or three minutes i'm sure he's  doing his radio show right now where do you display the heat i was in a diner with him in rochester  and we were talking about death and stuff and he he he him and death it doesn't scare him uh in the  least he's one of these he's one of those guys ah my brother's like that too well when it happens 
[01:01:30]  yeah really you don't you don't get woken up in the middle of the night uh he realizing you're  gonna be dead someday you're you're the only one that that that it doesn't bother you but then  wheezes in there he's like yeah i want to like uh i don't know if how i'm gonna get this done but  i want my family to you know take my head well how do you display it i don't know we'll have to get  him on the phone to talk about it for a couple minutes oh he's dead serious i hope he wants to have  something done to it not just have it rotting imagine totally natural it stinks up the living 
[01:02:00]  room sitting there on a shelf and nobody yeah and it's just kind of rotting i don't know how we're  gonna get a hold of him because my stupid blackberry doesn't work what all right we'll uh we'll try to  do it after the break and we'll give us a couple minutes it's it's twisted but he's dead serious  because he's got his father's ashes on his mantle so he wants to do it take it to the next level he's  like yeah ashes a lot of people do that everyone does the ashes he somehow wants them to preserve 
[01:02:30]  his head his head yeah futurama they actually talk on futurama oh uh yeah you know what this is this  one got me worse than the horse you're right rob go ahead rob talking about the body exhibit as well  go ahead yeah a couple years ago i went to the body exhibit in philly and uh halfway through the exhibit  you see what look like a family like a man a woman and a child and i guess it's the vascular system  just all the veins and capillaries but to to to see how many veins that you have through your entire 
[01:03:00]  body just look like a the entire body just like a ball of like knotted up twine and stuff and it's  just incredibly freaky just to see that your entire body's just made up of just there's like not one  square millimeter or a centimeter of space on you that's just not completely covered yeah what's  robbing and how they and how they pull that out of you rob i gotta explain further just so everyone's  on the same page they were able to take everything else out of this body except for the capillary and 
[01:03:30]  uh yeah and then it was still in the form of a human being there was no skin there was no muscle  there was no bones right yeah i don't know how the f they got that they pump they pump the veins  and arteries full of polyurethane and then let everything else and everything else they can peel  away after it hardens wow and and you actually have this the whole uh a circulatory system um intact  and then everything else is like you know there was a nice moment during the body's exhibit they have 
[01:04:00]  like a a mother with her uh baby i'm like oh look how nice that is and then you go wait a minute that  these people had to die to be in this exhibit but how they how they presented it it was like oh look  look at this how nice a mom and a child together how pretty yes sir yeah anthony towards the end of  the exhibit i saw they had a bunch of um like you know uh mice that were just uh you know drinking  out of some uh they looked thirsty did they it was so weird to see the mice and their capillaries 
[01:04:30]  holding little pollen spring waters doubt that that is true i made the whole thing up i'm kidding oh  jimmy jc how old are you now jc you're still 13 yeah i'm still 13 april you got one more month well  with those initials just be nervous when you're 33 april what sir uh april 15th ah april 15th  i'm the 26th yes are you a taurus  uh i have no idea or an aries i don't know don't they start in the 20s well don't you know what the 
[01:05:00]  hell you're no i think you guys are different because you're 26 and he's 15 so i think that's  two different ones it's something i think yes right because i just made gemini barely yeah  because it's uh may 23rd does anyone even care about your birth signs anymore no but you know  it's not the 70s man yeah i don't really believe in astrology at all but it might have something  some bearing only for your personality because of uh where the earth is when it happens and uh we are 
[01:05:30]  water-based creatures you don't know that so there may be something but i get tired of here you know  you're kind of a you're you're you're a cat from leocuts do you know what uh yeah star your uh sign is  in what planet phase mars was in when you were born what shut up how about just live your life and  stop trying to figure out why you're an ass it's when dad uh nine months after dad uh dropped one 
[01:06:00]  exactly after the commercial break for that whatever movie was shown in 1967 drunk dad rolled over on mom  and uh during bonnie and clive  i i did the math and i was uh i was my dad's birthday uh bang oh really nice hey nice birthday  bang his birthday is march mine's december i just i figured it out one day i was like ew  i was a i was a honeymoon baby for the day my brother was born um six months after my parents got

[01:07:00]  are you jimmy i'm a cancer but i'm on the leo cause why do they name a sign after a horrific disease too  i don't know understood that it's like what are you i'm tuberculosis i was born in march i'm tuberculosis  yeah i was born under the sign of aids great  cancer is a water sign you know most mice are cancers  uh there goes little uh 13 year old jc what do you what you say about the body exhibit oh yeah 
[01:07:30]  okay well i went to the exhibit and it was really really freaky because they literally took a dead  body and cut it up so it looked like what an mri would see all right like in slivers like in that  movie um yeah yeah what the hell movie was that they did that to the horse it's pretty cool uh  uh yeah uh back to the future no the cell thank you point blank so you like the jc yeah it was cool 
[01:08:00]  but it was freaky at the same time yeah did you see any uh uh wee wees yeah it's quite a few  yeah in the men's room of the place oh uncle paul they're all about the wee wees in this uh bodies  exhibit yeah oh yeah they keep them all intact really what about the women were you able to see  oh yeah kind of uh yeah well they removed the skin and everything so there really isn't that much 
[01:08:30]  but you saw a little something did you giggle i'd have giggled at 13 and gone ha ha ha tee hee well  you know if they're going to show the penises you think they should have got the bodies from the  congo all right jc get out get lost go learn something yeah all right little bastard there  he goes yeah the pregnant lady at the bodies exhibit too yeah that one was i think that was the one i'm  thinking of she's pregnant you're like oh look you know a pregnant mom gonna give birth oh no she's  not no she's frozen in time perpetually preggers right open anthony stay there 
[01:09:00]  checking out the op and anthony show looks like we got we's on hold here  we're gonna sync up a couple morning shows because uh we told me a little story when i was at a diner  in rochester i think last year nice uh dining uh conversation oh no kidding man this guy isn't  afraid of death you can learn a thing or two from this man  what are we waiting for you still calling him

[01:10:30]  saying one more thing i want to pass along because i think i did this story a few weeks ago is about  the doctor in york city uh in a messy divorce and funny please sue the show for using his signal  a court has rejected he didn't really want it back but it's kind of what they made the story sound  like a court has rejected the surgeon's claim that he should get a one and a half million dollars  in his divorce settlement this is easy uh as compensation to the donated kidney they have  decided that the kidney was a gift it was not marital property although the doctor's attorney says 
[01:11:00]  he considered like real news and stuff right because the donation will be considered as a  factor in the overall distribution of marital assets really she'll get something for the kidney  good for him interesting brother deserves a little something for the kidney thanks dougie  all right everybody have a good one that's kind of cool actually she gets the kidney get the house  or something obi-wan kenobi hey weese what's up buddy is it you yeah it's us it's me it's jimmy 
[01:11:30]  it's anthony hey hey listen before you got whatever it is you gotta ask for the first time in my life  somehow they put me on the subscription list for talkers magazine yeah and i know you had that dude on  the show a few years ago yeah yep you saw what the douchebag ranked you guys uh yeah we're uh one  above bubba the love sponge right that redneck hillbilly who does awful radio bro please what  about everyone else that's in front of you i know what are you what are you gonna do bob and tom bro  yeah bob and tom they're great aren't they yeah no i'm not you know i mean it's just that friggin 
[01:12:00]  magazine that guy should go hang himself well we bitch because one year he didn't even put us in the  top 100 like and he goes oh it was a mistake i'm sorry and then the next year i think he put us at  number six which is huge and then we've been slowly moving down the list ever since thanks for bringing  this up by the way because we weren't even going to talk about it what do you care about your show  is phenomenal who cares what that dick rod says yeah we're at 51 and i think bubba was 52 and bubba's 
[01:12:30]  the type of guy that cares about these lists so it's got to drive him nuts that we're one above him  what does he think about the other people though there's a whole bunch of i mean at the end of  that thing there's there's morning shows in in bum f bigger bum after where i'm at yeah and who are  these guys are there they're nobodies it's a joke what's going on bro how's new york it's good we we  were talking about death today and i was telling these guys that you're one of those guys that you're  not scared to die and all that fun stuff but i i told them a story i was up there and uh we were at a 
[01:13:00]  diner and you said you want to save your head or something yeah i want to make a business i think  i think people should do it and how is this going to work i just want to know the logistics behind  saving your head it's easy bro this is not what you might think i'm talking you see the skull i've  been wearing skull rings and i got skulls tattooed i'm a a lot of people like the skulls now i'm saying  my daddy is on my mantle as we speak just as ashes i keep my daddy so you can watch it he was a gambler 
[01:13:30]  he likes to watch the football games make a wager i got my daddy forever i want my people to keep  my skull skulls are cool bro think about it oh that's different how is that different than his  head it is my head because because your family's gonna go wow that was my daddy yeah that's gonna  be that's creepy bro they can put cool hats on it and everything he's serious too and it's i am  stone serious i don't think there's anything weird about it but i think you know someday people  you don't might want to get in first of all there's no room to get buried people are going 
[01:14:00]  in those boxes in the wall now right do you know it'd be great if they save your head and they just  stand up in front of a tv and show gay pornography 24 hours a day now that would piss me off that would  piss me off but you never know you know doreen's not gonna let that happen yes she i'm telling you  she's gonna she's gonna put your skull on a mantle someday she knows that i love it and she can put  it in funny hats and i can beat a skull i mean we've all seen skulls we dig don't we yeah why  not have it be someone you dug you know she's gonna do it for about a week because it's your 
[01:14:30]  wishes and then you know you're gonna end up in a closet somewhere behind a bunch of boxes in a  bowling ball bag how about how about if they paint it up nice that'd be good maybe put some like grapes  so plums in your eye sockets i like it they can break it out every super bowl party or something  yeah you could eat like dip well anyway if you sincerely step back and think about it it's cool  as hell and i don't care what they do to it because they'll be talking to you loving it you know 
[01:15:00]  playing with it it's cool and then wouldn't it suck though if there was an afterlife and then  people would be like oh my god dude you needed that skull you're walking around with this deflated  head please please forget that afterlife garbage i'm with bill maher there is an afterlife i know  here we go religious guys are popping up well the religious was a great eye-opening uh documentary  that bill maher did so i loved it i i want to like the guy but he was such a a dick to us when we were  in la that you know and then we were pumping up his movie and he decided not to do our show the guy 
[01:15:30]  comes off so self-important no matter what he's doing if he just like toned it down a little bit  where maybe he could be a little self-deprecating right the guy is just the most important most  intelligent man on the face of the earth well unfortunately i'm a humongous fan because of  the politics and i can't disagree with what you're saying right i mean it bums me out that somebody on  my team uh acts like that you know i need guys to be a little cooler than what you just described 
[01:16:00]  is bill maher that's how he acts i think you would uh bring a lot more people in if you just lightened  up a little bit well who's his friend someone should tell him no kidding well anyways i was uh i was  with a very staunch republican friend of mine yesterday i didn't tell these guys yet we're coming  home on the thruway and it was a a chrysler van loaded with barack obama green stickers everything  right we passed the guy i'm going here's a guy on my team you know and this guy's going i can't even  look at people like that the guy gave me the stink eye i couldn't believe it i go bro i'm on your team 
[01:16:30]  and then i ended up cutting them off and he comes swirling around fingering me  i'm on your team you're not supposed to act like that and the republican dude laughing look at them  ass wives you hang out with you can't have obama stickers and be acting like a schmuck  that's funny i i cut those people off all the time because of course uh we as you know my politics  uh uh differ a little different than yours well just slightly to the right of uh obama's  slightly to the right of goebbels 
[01:17:00]  yeah that's what i don't know i don't know bro i mean i can't be there to uh sway you but you can't  be a comedian and stuff and be on the right you're screwed up that is your soul to soul i don't know  uh we i gotta say you're right about the the right has not been good but the left has not been good  with political correctness and free speech either which makes it kind of tough as a comedian  when the groups that want to silence you the most tend to be uh uh liberal organizations lately 
[01:17:30]  is that jimmy yeah but jimmy you're you're buying into propaganda that's not true don't be listening  to that fairness thing take that out and you know damn well liberals are for nothing but talking all  the crap you can talk but that's not true political correctness uh comes from the left more so than the  right as far as you know uh um uh offending people they're the first ones to come forward and go hey  stop that don't talk about blacks or asians in that fashion that's terrible uh they're the first ones to  jump out and and even if you're doing it in humorous context as a comedian uh they'll crucify you i just 
[01:18:00]  called i just got within the last three days i was called to the carpet i had to do a public apology  uh you wouldn't believe what happened wait what happened bro i was at i was at a academy awards  party for the am talk station here yeah and uh you know jerry lewis was getting uh getting as  humanitarian award yeah and uh there were people in wheelchairs protesting yeah i don't know if you  know about all this so the news came and wanted my opinion now i didn't know what jerry lewis was 
[01:18:30]  about except that i'm a big fan because i'm jewish it's a rule if you're a jew and you like  entertainment jerry lewis is one of your guys king of comedy come on there you go french right so  you know i'm telling you the truth i saw him in uh in um damn yankees on broadway and i cried when  he came out oh boy i'm not that much of a fag bro you're not my friend anymore bro i can't hang  with you anymore but listen to this so they put me on the tv and you know how they do the only two  clips they showed was i said uh don't be protesting jerry lewis and they show me again and i go 
[01:19:00]  i got a bulletin for you he's a comedian you know because i didn't know what he had done right now  i find out i get called i go to this disabilities joint sit at a table with my boss and a bunch of  people in wheelchairs and they told me all these terrible things jerry lewis had done which they  had documented and they were actually terrible and he said that these people are half the people  they don't shouldn't be able to get jobs and he actually said in vanity fair in 1993 quote 
[01:19:30]  f them say it in caps and then you can see it in caps f-u-m so you know and so here i was sticking  up for the guy without so i had to apologize but a guy coming out and saying something like in an  interview like hey all kidding aside at people in wheelchairs is different than when somebody says  something in humor and people know it's being said in humor but they're choosing to kind of like  hijack that moment to push their agenda farther like that that's like i could see people being pissed  off that he said that but like you know whether it was i missed or the asian groups those are all 
[01:20:00]  left-wing ideologies being pushed and that's what guys have been getting fired for well you know i'm  not going to debate you with that because uh it's pretty much of a point but there is a reason for  political correctness which i actually try to subscribe to because i don't see uh i mean if people are  sincerely hurt by anything i don't think i don't know why they should be we should be cooler and more  progressive than that but but we doesn't want people but it's a transient thing what people  find acceptable or not acceptable because believe it or not it's like there are places where they 
[01:20:30]  still ban interracial couples at proms like i can't comprehend that but there are segments of  our population that find that really offensive um so if we call it's radio i shouldn't raise my hand  i know especially not the right one straight out like that but you know it's like if you worry about  offending people like with stuff like that it's like you know it's it's such a subjective thing man  people being hurt is a lot of times their way of getting attention or uh you know a lot of uh ways 
[01:21:00]  they're they're trying to control what you say so they they feign being injured so you have to apologize  not saying well you know something you can't say i mean it's like abortion and everything else you  can't even uh you can't argue those things and you being in radio you you know obviously know that  no matter what you say uh somebody is going to be hurt and offended by it and sometimes you're  taken completely aback because you're like i would i didn't even sometimes i know stuff i'm saying  is is going to hurt somebody somewhere but you know if it's a joke or something whatever yeah 
[01:21:30]  sometimes i talk about things that i'm affected by personally in in a humorous fashion uh but you  know something you could just no matter what you say somebody's going to jump down your throat and go  oh you you hurt this or hurt me i love your show that's what i hate i love your show but when you  said this it's like oh so you laughed at everything else when it didn't involve you then it hits too  close to home that's human nature you know but you love it until it hits too close to home that's just  it that's why i think like that you you there's no right uh being an american there's no right to 
[01:22:00]  not be offended by something uh and and that's something that's hard to beat through people's  heads by the way norton you're huge bro i was in the palm beach airport who knows how big that  bookstore is you got two books right in front oh really that's huge that's where the discount bin is  exactly you know what going with that uh my wife's good friend is now living in dubai 
[01:22:30]  in the dubai bookstore i forgot to tell you really i'm telling jimmy right now live yeah oh great so i  can never go there they'll probably have like a guy with a machete waiting at the airport but i'm  thinking how do they get that done in in dubai you can't have that type of material in dubai  obviously you can yeah no kidding obviously you can dubai's supposed to be the coolest place  yeah i want to go hello it's not like you're going to like saudi arabia we're actually we're  actually going to go and uh and uh visit this dude oh yeah i'm going to get to dubai yeah i need

[01:28:00]  cookies in honor of our president right honor we're in honor of the people that voted well what was his  take on that thing again his take on this thing was trying to sell cookies right obama's not a drunk  so it's like i don't get the drunken negro face it was uh it was tasteless for many why you have  want to use more sugar yes we got sugar wine you might have to make cookies with 30 or 40 clans 
[01:28:30]  i love cookies oh that's right my i had a cooking place and i would make yam cookies  ew why yam yams are delicious gregory especially in cookie form i hate the yam they're wonderful  yam socks baloney cookies for big sellers baloney cookies yes  they sound very perishable they are they had a shelf life of 11 minutes 
[01:29:00]  well we got an update on uh drunken negro face cookie guy oh yeah yes i was kind of surprised that uh  we'll put the picture up of the cookie on onaradio.com i was surprised that uh  this guy kind of went away there was a little bit of a protest we went down there to try to talk to  the guy and he kind of closed his business for a few days yeah i guess that's what you have to do  you know and then you reopen and everyone leaves you alone but this guy never went away and uh we got 
[01:29:30]  an update today the day after our initial report we broadcast what the baker called an apology  but the reaction intensified the new black panthers began protesting every saturday  outside the bakery on greenwich avenue local officials including state senator thomas duane  demanded the baker undergo diversity training we really pushed him and pushed him and pushed him  to agree to allow the state to come in and do a training wow and what his responsibilities are 
[01:30:00]  so last week capolinos attended us uh wow do you i'm sorry to interrupt the clip do you believe  go ahead hit it the nerve hit it of the government to step in with a business owner  and say that we think he needs to feel differently about the product how dare you it is uh just an  intrusion that's our lives by the government now that is the left yes exactly that is the left 
[01:30:30]  that wheeze back in the phone sensitivity training how dare you he would actually agree with you on  this one yeah i know you know you can't allow you can't allow the government to do that whether you  like or or hate the drunken negro face cookie guy you can't do this you can't do this it's freedom  of expression and you diversity training right we're based in in in freedom of expression and  free speech and sometimes people are not going to like it and a free market too you know yes let's 
[01:31:00]  not forget that it's simple if you don't if enough people don't like drunken negro face cookie guy he's  going out of business because he's not going to get the business he needs to keep going we're living  in a uh world uh and this is a related story we could talk about it later a little more in depth but  the united nations is trying to pass a um resolution to make it illegal to criticize islam  in any way shape or form uh yes and and yes crazy absolutely they are and this isn't some wacky guy 
[01:31:30]  in there just running off at the mouth and everybody going oh they're gonna friggin pass this thing  where the countries then have uh you know based on their laws uh the right to then um either adopt  the law or not but the united nations is going to push this forward where a country will be able  to say you cannot criticize islam or you will suffer a penalty uh depending you know it could be 
[01:32:00]  anything from a slap on the wrist to death and um it's it's uh obviously um a freedom of speech issue  here in this country but you know that means a guy that uh writes an article about it posts something  on a website uh is uh could be held criminally liable for uh critiquing islam which by the way  why would they need a resolution for just islam uh why look people comment a little too much people 
[01:32:30]  saying things that may be a little uh hurtful a little too true or is it a fear-based thing because  of the absolute 15th century barbarism they use to deal with people who disagree with them  whether it's intelligently or not uh their their their answer is to stab the playwright and then sit  on his chest right and wait for the police to show up uh that is their uh that's their answer the  united nations is being run by uh islam uh at this point it really is it it should just it should 
[01:33:00]  absolutely not be in this uh it shouldn't be in the state of new york uh especially manhattan and it  shouldn't be in this country the united nations should be moved out of this goddamn country  i'm tired of it these these uh people come here they do nothing but slam us and then they're treated  like kings when they come here they go to the finest restaurants nightlife they enjoy the finest 
[01:33:30]  hookers they love it oh they love it and then they all they do is bash yeah get out of here  put it in some crap hole that you live in who's pushing this resolution yeah we're gonna have to  follow this there's a huge delegation of of uh islamic states that that are pretty much running  the united nations now so if all the islamic states say uh this is what they want they have  enough uh they got enough numbers to get this through yeah they're fine can't the u.s can't the u.s  veto it um do we really believe this is not a security council issue this right right this is 
[01:34:00]  a binding resolution binding resolution that's what it's called the fourth straight year that  they have attempted to push this through they have a 57 nation organization and uh that is asking the  u.n to adopt legislation banning the defamation of religion and this came out of that cartoon that  was all religion well they're specifically uh targeting islamic defamation yes because of the  remember the cartoon a couple years ago and there's a dutch documentarian who's not been  allowed to travel to england because they want to prosecute him for defaming islam in england in 
[01:34:30]  england well england by the way state is sickening uh you think england people i get i've had enough  of hearing about how great england is uh because their problems our problems black and white are their  problems with i guess islam and non-islam muslim non-muslim yeah they are because that like ken  livingston was the mayor of of london just a groveling groveling terrified yes yes of course  wow yeah england england for free speech sucks we'll follow that one but we don't really listen to 
[01:35:00]  the united nations huh uh less less and less we do less and less used to but bush didn't really listen  to the united nations now did he it was uh yeah years ago not when it served some kind of a purpose  now it's just uh it's just showboating all right let's get back to the the drunken nero face cookie  guy so where were we the government stepped in and who pretty much said hinted that uh this guy  should do a little diversity training right yes the state some some politician i've never heard of 
[01:35:30]  before but can you imagine if they bashed christianity and a politician had said we sent that we think the  state should send somebody in to teach you about bashing christianity how fast people would be up  in arms about it who is this dumb democrat obviously well let's listen and find out more here so last  week capolinos attended a state division of human rights racial sensitivity training session oh my god 
[01:36:00]  racial sensitivity what radio station did they get this broad from to come in and give the training  class like when you get too many tickets and have to go to that class do you really care or you're  just going to get your record clean you're sitting there with a bunch of racists and everything else  like you're doing those those uh driving classes it's like yeah i was drinking yeah i got a ticket go to  that class to make new friends yeah that's what it does look out smoke a butt talk about the  all right yeah we got a break coming up jesus you know what though that's that's so true yeah last 
[01:36:30]  week capolinos attended a state division of human rights racial sensitivity training session a session  senator duane's staff reported was not very successful he really needs to undergo much more sensitivity  training because i'm not sure that he's completely gotten the message yet what do you want to give him  electric shock treatment a lobotomy right just have him card him out and let chief smother him with 
[01:37:00]  a pillow with my personal i hate the guy i hate the drunken negro face cookie guy i really don't know  drunken face negro cookie guy i don't know what he does i understand i understand you have to take  that position for your for your fellow message tell him you don't like sugar cookies i'll never make  him again believe me i understand yeah i i don't like this guy from what because of what you know  whatever but uh this is even worse this whole uh government stepping in with the diversity training  crap my the language this scumbag is using amazing my chest i'd like to slap his face it is so 
[01:37:30]  completely anti-american without even trying to camouflage it right this is an against everything  that this country stands for everything now we've listened to two clips you know who this person is the  reporter right anyone anyone anyone anyone anyone don't say i don't know i know i don't know i mean  you know i i had no dad you would know you don't shame shame on you guy arnold diaz arnold diaz now is 
[01:38:00]  arnold diaz gonna step in and say how outrageous this is hopefully shame on arnold diaz if he doesn't  how about arnold diaz saying shame on this was an assemblyman this bum right who is this it's a  senator from where from where and what what democrat obviously but i i think he said senator  doucheville dwayne which is the state senator who handles that region on the west side  i thought i heard him say senator dwayne's staff we can't allow this to happen man 
[01:38:30]  let's pick up our arms and go down there more sensitivity training  the government is deemed this gentleman needs more sensitivity training and i hate to bring up  uh uh things like this but when you watch the movie 1984 it is hysterical how they they actually want  the person to believe before they kill them right like they do want the person to love big brother in  the country and and everything like like so the sensitivity training they actually want this guy 
[01:39:00]  and expect him to change his thinking based on what the government thinks is is best or what is  popular and acceptable at the moment yeah yeah where are here's what i want to know all you slippery  slope liberals and where are you where are you complaining all you big brother obsessed liberals  who complain about well they put up traffic cams they're gonna monitor me yeah and here's a guy 
[01:39:30]  saying the government thinks he needs to think differently where are you where's your outrage  why are you screaming i apologize that's bigger than that's bigger than any traffic camera or or uh  uh phone tapping or any of that stuff is the fact that this guy is is implying that the government  should be in charge of changing your thinking changing your baking changing your baking habits 
[01:40:00]  your baking habits it should just like what who who the hell is this guy this guy should say you know  what i don't agree with this uh business owner at all yeah but unfortunately the price you pay in a  free society right is people are going to do and say things that don't infringe on your rights that you  don't like absolutely but you know we've we don't have that in this country and i want to know  everyone should understand that by the way so many people out there still don't understand the point  jimmy just made the basic point of this country where are all of you outraged liberals who i hear from 
[01:40:30]  all the time and you complain all the time about big brother where are you with this type of thinking  you allow it they're standing around him in that picture all smiling at him is what they're doing  big fat so he has a dumb dumb tie this guy's bakery would close quicker than anything if they  just publicized the fact and nobody would shop there but i would you're not going to change his  mind when did tim sabian going into politics yeah really tight slacks god i hate this guy  our report also got the attention of the united states secret service that do good i hate the secret 
[01:41:00]  service investigating cookies there's so much going on with this story i hate arnold  he's he's that guy that we all hated in school he's an attention whore the guy that had to be the  tattletale well i want to know the principal behind your back did the secret service get in touch with  jesse jackson after he was heard whispering into a fox news microphone that he wanted to rip obama's 
[01:41:30]  testicles off this is a guy with with right access to obama that's a great question this is a guy  something you have to look into yeah when someone says that especially on tv but he didn't mean for it to  be heard so it was actually said in a private moment which is even which is even scarier and  this is a guy who has not searched before he sees the president this is a guy who has  unrestricted access to the president so the secret service contact him that's a great question or is  it only in stupid cookie uh cookie making things the secret service is investigating cookies 
[01:42:00]  god is arnold diaz a sissy  our report also got the attention of the united states secret service thank god right arnold agents  were recently sent to speak with the baker about statements he allegedly made to two customers  and um as he walked away he continued on to say um he's following the same path as abraham lincoln he  will get his but the secret service wanted to know more kefalinos told the villager newspaper 
[01:42:30]  they asked if i'd ever been treated for any mental illness the answer's no they asked if i'd been to  washington recently am i a member of any groups he refused to say what else the beatles  nothing happened nothing happened  oh boy that's probably standard questions this guy's gonna be found dead  nah six months from now tiny little story page 84 on the paper cookie man  that was it and arnold diaz is such a fraud i hate him wouldn't you love if anybody listening 
[01:43:00]  we have people in the media that listened can somebody contact him and say why aren't you doing  a piece on this fat piggy uh senator whatever he is and say why are you thought policing citizens  why are you legislating thought we don't see it as thought policing at all what we're doing  is sensitivity training this gentleman obviously isn't sensitive to the diversity that we have in 
[01:43:30]  this great land of our blah blah blah blah blah shut it wow there's some crazy phone calls coming in  what let me play the last clip and uh everyone on hold just stay there  then last week he posted this notice of apology in the store window it says in part to the people  who perceived our product was offensive i apologize for an error in judgment what i saw as a flower  you saw as a thorn based on cross-cultural differences his supporters say the baker has 
[01:44:00]  suffered enough over an innocent mistake  tears wow that's hilarious he thought it was a cute little flower thing what i saw as a flower  you saw as a bucket of chicken excellent apology jesus way to go we're not saying this guy isn't a  dummy and he's really sorry about it because he had no idea that it would hurt people's feelings 
[01:44:30]  but some say the apology which blames the irresponsible misrepresentations of the media  and refers to the customer who blew the whistle on the cookies as a helen of troy type is further  proof the baker just doesn't get it  he can't use shame on you anymore because he changed stations good i am enzo i'm here for the  cookies cookies for your president for your president president we gotta go to greg in philly 
[01:45:00]  listen to this uh greg you're on the opian anthony show hey guys i'm just calling for the main fact  that it seems like you guys are just trying to pick a fight it's like you're angry about something  and then you're just calling this guy out he definitely has mental issues correct who does cookie  guy we don't know we're not we're not calling cookie guy out that would mean anthony has mental  issues right no i understand i understand but what my point is this is not that big of a deal  this isn't affecting you how does this affect you how does this because this kind of thing uh 
[01:45:30]  snowballs just like this stupid uh politician talking about the thought policing people's  sensitivity you don't think that's that's crazy that that a politician should get in in somebody's  face and say that you're not thinking properly and you need to go to some kind of training you don't  find that dangerous anthony this man made national headlines basically threatening the president in  an indirect way off baked goods this guy has issues dude dude this the the politician is mentioning 
[01:46:00]  sending this guy to sensitivity training not based on any threats he made but based on the fact that his  cookie was uh offensive not that it had nothing to do with any threats that were made the secret  service visited him based on some woman uh saying that he said something but this politician saying  that he needs to go to sensitivity training wasn't based on the fact that he made any threats uh uh to 
[01:46:30]  the president it was that he wasn't being sensitive to uh the uh uh to black people by making these  cookies is that crazy a little bit because listen because listen on the other on the other end of the  spectrum you look at it this man is making baked goods correct correct right right that's it yeah  that's it and now at the end of the day just i don't i'm an idiot i don't know what to say  dude you just no no no the problem is this you're wrong because it's a national story so we're talking  about it uh if he made a threat towards the president the secret service has got to talk to you 
[01:47:00]  okay fine that's that's no one's complaining about that that's whatever that's fine if he said  something about obama getting shot like a guy fine you got to be talking about the secret service  yeah of course we're talking about the politically incorrect angle of the cookies  this mock outrage and this this this fruity politician um and the thought policing how is  that not bothering you and i've never heard liberals stick up for for points of view they  don't agree with jimmy hold on jimmy first off you're an idiot i'm not going to listen to you 
[01:47:30]  well my point is if he said no i do not want to go if he said no sir i'm gonna just i agree with  the guy now well sir i'm going to you you have no point and you know that you're probably a guilty  liberal who cannot defend that your own ideology is just kind of biting itself in the ass now  jimmy you're an uneducated ass when it comes to politics really sit there explain what i just said  100 percent explain what do you want me to explain about james how is how am i wrong  and what and what and what personally what respect james what what do you want from me 
[01:48:00]  uh i want to know a politician first of all did you say in what retrospect  sorry sir you dummy uh but i'm uneducated uh so i'd like to know how how is that good where this  politician is legislating thought and thinking the state should send uh or have this man sent to  sensitivity training for an issue that should have nothing to do with the state it's it's the bigger  picture it's the fact you guys are making an uproar about something you have no control you don't think 
[01:48:30]  that it's an important issue that politics politicians the government is is going to police  what you think if this man said no would he go to jail would they lock him up 10 years so the thought  just just the concept my friend of this politician bringing this up that that people should go to  sensitivity training based on what the government believes is offensive is crazy and and should be 
[01:49:00]  looked into it is very serious he's doing it for this man's own safety could you imagine opening up  a shop with thanks that's what we need the government's stepping in for our own safety that's always what  it is it's always our safety there you go thanks a lot i appreciate that kiddo you just keep justifying  your own ideology shortcomings you just keep explaining away why it's big brother when it's  conservative but it's for your safety when it's liberal you just keep on doing that but i'm an 
[01:49:30]  uneducated dummy you keep on justifying how slippery slope is okay when it's conservative but there's  never a slippery slope issue when it's liberals offending you we're helping you helping you  protecting well you crack dick jokes for a living jim you hold no ground in any argument by the way  hold on sir let me correct you you this is why i hold ground in an argument you silly child  because i do use expression and talking for a living this guy was doing an unpopular form of  expression and now the government is stepping in so if i'm expressing something that's unpopular or 
[01:50:00]  offensive to a small segment of the population you're goddamn right i have a reason to be annoyed  when it's being addressed with someone else should jimmy go to sensitivity training because of uh  some of the stuff he says in his act no he doesn't have mental why he's not a complete psycho pad  he's just a moron dude you're being murdered in this argument you look how does it feel to have  your ass handed to you in an argument you're a terrible debater all right well then you know  what fine i'm just gonna hang up because you guys can't look at the fact you do that that big of a 
[01:50:30]  deal just hang up little boy little boy just hang up you you suck and your ideology sucks and you  cannot face that you cannot face the fact that liberals really are not for free speech or they'd be  standing up defending this guy saying he's an ass but he has the right to be an ass in a free  society he's just basically being helped out at the end of the day sure he is that's what you do  out all right thank you very much let's go to jonathan's helping by telling you that you need to 
[01:51:00]  think differently i could have listened to that guy i know just dig your own graves stupid just keep  digging we're stupid we're fans of less government we're fans of the politicians leaving our music our radio  shows our video games right just leaving us the eff alone but greg and philly you be a good boy  and you keep being told how to think good boy we got an angry liberal on the line here and he agrees  with jimmy jonathan from long island he's labeled himself angry liberal what's up jonathan morning  guys hey not only am i an angry liberal i'm a law professor really liberal dude i totally agree with 
[01:51:30]  you totally you uh the answer to speech you don't like more speech yeah you know what people don't  like this guy let them stand in front of his uh shop with uh cookies in his image right  okay we're totally dead i'm sorry i just i i stood i stood with you guys i stood with on this  even if i disagree with them this is america you don't get to tell me what you think do you think 
[01:52:00]  what i think i i agree with you because i i'm one of these idiots that holds myself and everybody  else to the kind of the same standards do you think i agree with farrakhan i mean no but i would  never want farrakhan to have any repercussions for what he said other than maybe people who don't agree  with him don't show up to hear him talk it's it's like so if i don't agree with a guy and i'm all for  him saying whatever he wants why shouldn't other people feel the same way about what i say or anybody  else it's like it's simple that's the basics we're a country of spoiled babies who kick and scream until 
[01:52:30]  we get our own way and we don't like what somebody said so we want people to legislate so they can't  say it that's all that's all it is is a spoiled children we are uh oh go ahead sorry sir that guy  from philly the only reason he can stand on the radio and talk to you guys is because of that he was a  dummy dog absolutely i wouldn't mind debating a guy if he was brighter but to hear like you're an  idiot like it's like all right child just i'm not your mommy and daddy you're not trying to get extra 
[01:53:00]  allowance from me if you're gonna call in and debate a point just be a man and debate it don't be  kicking and screaming little boy this is not mommy you're talking to we have to head toward a break  but dan and east meadow i don't think we have uh we might have just a dan if you make it quick we  can squeeze you in here what's up yeah i know i don't agree with the politician but why don't they go  to the freaking rap artist it's a double standard again the typical double standard and the guy from  philly was a douche yeah well he knows that he is he is a douche but again it's embarrassing when  the rap artists definitely say some outrageous stuff should uh they uh take sensitivity train 
[01:53:30]  yes i you know i'm not a big fan of the rapper thing but i i feel like they should be able to sing  whatever they want i feel the same way oh but you know come on no more double standard i i agree  where is this this liberal what's it tom duane whatever his name where is he knocking on uh  why isn't he in east new york knocking on the door of some rapper or or why isn't he uh going to  bust a rhymes place or or some other rapper that says things some people find offensive because 
[01:54:00]  that's too scary of course it is that's another theme theme of our show the politicians take on the  easy stuff they're cowards they always take on the real easy headlining making stuff of real  problems please blank please  opiate anthony just around midnight 877-212-01A what do we got phones are lit let's just ride the 
[01:54:30]  phones to the end here  uh tony black guy dc yeah hey what's going on hey tony how are you buddy stop hey look anthony  no man i'm telling you you you you you're going nuttier and nuttier man why is that first of all  jim yes sir jim you're a liberal and open you're a liberal but both of you guys are like exhibiting  cognitive dissidents right now like oh that's the left i'm not part of the left i'm i don't think 
[01:55:00]  those things you know it's like tony hold on hold on i i am socially liberal about a lot of stuff like  i'm for gay marriage i am for a lot of stuff oh when it comes to like a crime and issues like that i  tend to be more conservative so i'm not really a liberal uh at heart but i agree with him about a lot  of uh what they say well here's the thing you guys have gotten into a pattern following this guy  anthony anthony i told you about the crazy train or trail or whatever you you keep going down that 
[01:55:30]  path because now everything is just the left it's called another man crazy too in the uh 30s  you always say that man hold on sorry tony what here's the thing look where was anthony and all  his guns and his weekend militia gang when bush was putting people in free speech zones when people  were walking into conventions with a bush sucks t-shirt on and they were told to take it off or get  about it it's all right same same thing happens with people that uh have anti-obama uh wear on 
[01:56:00]  and want to protest him they don't even get close to uh where he's speaking it's been that it's been  that way for years no it's been that way it's called 2003 and they call it they call it a security  issue well you think you think uh uh bill clinton didn't have people that uh when they uh were  criticizing him they didn't chase them away when the press was going to be around it's been happening  for years and we're not talking about that just uh people that are that are swept away from the 
[01:56:30]  president because uh you could even say that that oh it's a security threat the guy doesn't like him  whatever but some guy just babbling about cookies and uh saying a politician saying the government  should step in and reprogram this guy's head is a little off yeah tony where you at with that  tony where you at with that do you think that should have happened with this politician  no no because i i do believe because i listen to you guys show you know i love it i don't think  that the government should step in and tell anybody what to say or how to say it and everything 
[01:57:00]  but what the problem is is that anthony and then the republicans and everything they don't they don't  legislate free speech they don't say you know you can't say this but what they do what they do  is they demonize the people in public relentlessly i mean the dixie chick say uh i'm ashamed george  bush is from texas and that that that s ran on tv day and night radio day and night they were boycotted 
[01:57:30]  and everything yeah did they uh well well let me just came out of eight years of this this crazy guy  who i mean kidnap people off the streets and just call them a terrorist therefore you know i guess  they're terrorists because george bush pointed at him and said so and anthony and all his guns he never  had word one to say now he's put now he's uh uh putting all his guns in a safe phase he's so scared  for his money and his life i don't get this i mean like it's the angry white man thing angry white man 
[01:58:00]  thing if there's ever been a time for white man to be angry it's now it's why because we've been  pushed into a corner of political correctness yes of political correctness where we can't even  express ourselves without being called a racist it doesn't matter what we're talking about in what  context or anything racist racist racist racist that is the scarlet letter of the new millennium  is being called a goddamn racist it ruins your life your job disappears and you're banished 
[01:58:30]  for being called a racist no and that card is pulled every two seconds no no one is fired because  someone's called them wait wait wait hold on listen listen without reviewing the with the person said  they don't just go on where anybody says because some people do use you know saying racist too much  just like you use the analogy for obama and hitler every damn day who reviews who reviews what somebody 
[01:59:00]  says and determines that it's racist and the people should be fired oh who employer their employer  and then why does the employer have to do that is it because reverend al and his his mafia and his  mafia of extortionists come over and and and put pressure on the employer to have a more diverse  workplace or he's going to protest and makes threats uh uh of uh um of financial despair against 
[01:59:30]  the company if he doesn't fire the guy give me a break where we're put where white men are backed  into a corner now that we can't even get out of uh what when you see hate crimes i know what a hate  crime is every day when i hear one it's a black guy that some white guy uh uh assaulted or a white  group assaulted the other way around it's a robbery it's this it's that it's never a hate crime please  that that that case in california where that marine was killed by a black gang of his his uh own um uh 
[02:00:00]  subordinates uh that you mean to tell me that wasn't a hate crime the guy was married to a black  woman they called it a robbery they raped the woman murdered her killed the guy it that wasn't a  robbery that was based on hate that was a hateful murder tony when it comes to language anthony is  right uh white people are doing fine but when it comes to language and what's acceptable in language  oh tiptoe on the eggshells but look at look this is the thing look anthony is saying oh my god i'm 
[02:00:30]  being backed in the corner because people are saying things about me i mean look when people  were opposed in the iraq war people were saying they should be charged with treason now look treat  being charged with treason the punishment is death that's silly i i never agreed with that anthony is  being called a racist by who knows because every day he's angry about some random person  some random person you're right and it ruins his whole damn life look at his life his life is ruined 
[02:01:00]  my life's fantastical and class in one of his dens my life is great i live in a jewish neighborhood  you know what's amazing i love it tony's making a pretty good point how is he making a point some  random guy will just ruin your day random guy it's it's a different random guy every day than i'm 
[02:01:30]  seeing on convenience store security cameras on the news but you'll never have a relationship with  that person you'll never meet him how do i know how do i know it'll never affect you never leave  your house i'm sure the guy whose door was kicked in and he got a home invasion i'm sure he was  thinking the same thing it'll never happen to me frying pan lady she didn't need a gun well what  what well we didn't get to the story with a frying pan yeah she has an arsenal hey tony i got a  question i enjoy shooting guns they're fun tony you're not wrong tony hold on you talk about the 
[02:02:00]  bush sucks and people being thrown out for that you're right that is kind of free speech well you're  saying that bush started that i bet you it started even before bush we did but but i'm only trying to  say that all started in 2003 hold on let me ask you a question increased after after 9-11 and  everything okay this whole thing increased they have clear channel have uh billboards of george  bush just saying our leader we couldn't even say anything about this guy without being called  bush bashers but tony that was come on it was a weird time after 9-11 it's a weird example i'm 
[02:02:30]  talking about free speech repression and i don't disagree that bush sucks shirts should be allowed  at rallies but what i'm saying is the way the left will go after that and they'll address that is what  it is it's the unpopular speech being repressed because it's unpleasant for people to hear or see  at that moment but when it's the reverse the left doesn't address it and i'm the one that was screaming  about the left today because i've had to deal with them in show business for 19 years and i've had to  deal with standards and practices at networks and i see the sacred cows that they don't allow you to 
[02:03:00]  make fun of or that they curtail you making fun of it's a bigger issue too because you're talking  about the bush sucks the obama sucks t-shirts you can't even sit you can't even wear yankee socks  uh red socks suck t-shirts anymore yeah they're banning all that stuff we're all we're just trying  to express ourselves we're so sensitive now we're sensitive to everything this goes beyond politics  and and saying obama sucks or bush sucks you can't even say uh your arch rival in sports sucks  well but it was but this thing about just saying it's the left you know like this you know like 
[02:03:30]  this voltron like left character that's just roaming around just pointing at people taking away right  well the left says the right that's you know it's the same thing it's the same argument uh because the  the left says the right and and they criticize them i like to think and it's funny right though it's  funny that people um uh think i'm so far right i am completely for things like abortion uh you know 
[02:04:00]  woman's right to choose uh i'm you want to be a man's right to choose a man's right to choose  doc martin and then uh where you at with gay marriage yeah where you at with that i'm fine with  that go ahead you know get married you dummies you want to lose half your crap too to try to figure  out who the bitch is in the wedding uh so you know who gets all the money once you get a divorce  let him suffer like us heteros right ad  what that hack joke i hate that i'm like that i'm for that i'm just i hate that joke i'm not for 
[02:04:30]  my tax dollars being used for uh a certain uh liberal programs i don't like that uh what what  are you moaning about because because anthony you're taxing you're fine well i'm not going to say  you're fine because your taxes is going to go up yeah but after eight years i mean come on now  i mean be serious and i mean what don't you want your taxes to go to we pay the government the  government should do something in return i mean yeah yeah keep the roads nice something and pay for 
[02:05:00]  keep the roads nice keep the bridges built nice keep the railroads running things like that i don't  want to pay pay for midnight basketball oh it creates jobs no it doesn't that's what obama say  it's creating jobs don't look at each individual thing it's creating jobs in general barack going  to take ants money i'm uh yeah and i'm not happy about it but i have no problem if the government  takes just a little more just a little more a little more i give so much if it helps the country 
[02:05:30]  in general giving more money i'm not happy about it but i'm okay with it coming from somebody who  probably won't have to give more uh that's very uh sincere to what i really want i won't have to  give more i'm telling you the truth don't tell me you rob over 250 000 a year oh my god what's  wrong with you i'm having a very educated black man having fun with tony and he's got that comedy  you know what i noticed about tony he's got that civil rights voice yeah you can you could rise up my 
[02:06:00]  brother no because then anthony would be clapping on me but you got that voice you just need a  you just need a bullhorn and a box and you're ready to go man you got that you got that voice  to you you can get things done honestly what i would really want the government to do like tell me  force me to pick i'm serious about this too because i do make a very nice living force me to pick 20  people i have to help in this world then i'd be a lot happier with them taking a little more 
[02:06:30]  and if they did that with all the people that do well in their lives but force you go look okay it's  time and it has to be has to be people that aren't you know making a certain amount may even may even  give it the cutoff i don't care young white but that's the but see that's the same thing with taxes  is that your taxes are being used to help you know less fortunate people or other programs that help  you know okay midnight basketball okay i don't i don't understand that but let's be serious i mean 
[02:07:00]  you act like every program is midnight basketball no i mean jesus christ you know they have real  programs that they're that they're paying money into and you just don't want to pay i mean anything  more than what you already will you don't want to pay what you're paying now no i i i don't want to  pay more than i'm paying i've gotten used to paying what i got but um in in the new budget by  the way that obama put out uh you know how he was uh yeah it's coming out uh you know i was saying 
[02:07:30]  that the the the stimulus plan had no earmarks and and transparency and this isn't going to be  um like the old administration the new budget that is coming out by the way has get this nine  thousand earmarks in it nine thousand earmarks in it is that a lot then yeah i think that's a few  and then if i'm not mistaken i believe the attorney general went to guantanamo yeah to uh check things 
[02:08:00]  out and here's uh some obama transparency he shunned the press would not allow the press to follow him  uh to guantanamo to uh check out the things that are going on down there with that's transparency  that's business as usual what about these with these earmarks can you at least dip them in like  buffalo sauce and a little blue cheese here's the earmarks so we at least cook them up nice if  we're gonna have nine thousand of them nine thousand earmarks i i gotta read this brian from 
[02:08:30]  st louis he's a regular to the instant some are going to by the way uh here's here's uh some money  going to and this is no crap tattoo removal all right tattoo removal that's jobs what it is not  just stop those are jobs it is not you those are j-o-b you could say anything is jobs this is  stupid stuff but if it's if it gets someone working then it's a it helps out brian st louis writes uh  opie just said my brother getting a little too friendly again are you need a reminder of the old

[02:32:00]  yo what's up boys son of all you at work but uh do you do you think maybe we could do just just a  little bit of a show oh okay yeah we could do that what we are doing a show it's called a lousy  right you're right jimmy i'm sorry and number two real quick hey you need to uh oh instead of the  rice with your blackberry what you need to do is you got to get you have to get little straws  the moisture out of the i get you back to you yeah very good buddy you're a bum by the way we do 
[02:32:30]  have a little controversy here what around the studio what with this uh product what's that well  we should we have to find out what what happened oh oh i did hear about this in my views it's actually  a very very cool piece of technology to be honest with you um maybe they saw my view on it and said it's  mine it didn't say your view that's a good point you know what ain't you make a good point  why no i'll crash yourself on that but danny had uh taken some serious issue here and he did he was 
[02:33:00]  right if if that unless it was just a miscount crime dan well no i know i won't be ignored dan  the read started uh yesterday and i knew that some boxes had come in so i was kind of wondering what  happened to these boxes don't uh say that about ladies when they come into the studio beautiful  my view uh glasses we're supposed to have ten pairs and there's only nine pairs and everybody seems to  have a different story of ten pairs well yeah for giveaways so we can give some to the listeners 
[02:33:30]  wow and now there's only nine yeah someone let's guess who took it let's guess yes  it's my view that's right gay marriage is correct that's my view  who do you think took it uh i will say e-rock no why he's a thieving little  shit language he's a sneaky little shit just like you come on it's from animal house 
[02:34:00]  i don't know you rock put niedermeyer on it he's a sneaky little  shit just like you you rock is too busy i don't think i don't think the interns would  they're too scared we got them scared are you  i'm not making any accusations it's just that there were there are two boxes and they're both  open and one was obviously removed removed so why don't we just 
[02:34:30]  i just want to know what happened there so we take a break and like regroup here well i don't  know if we need to you know panic about it but i i think that uh steve what happened i don't  are you the only person i know who's yes we got uh two boxes of these glasses and i was told to  put them away until they figured out um what to do with them uh because some were for listeners  some were for staff i mean you guys and um and i guess ron and fez were supposed to get some too  and nobody who had access to the office well during the the question isn't about who they 
[02:35:00]  were for the question is where's the missing one is there a missing one is the question i thought  there were 10 in there and then now i'm just i counted and now there's nine i just went back  there and there were nine before i handed them out was there a miscount done there might have been  a miscount i might have looked and said yeah maybe they sent nine you're the one that was  responsible for the count who opened the box i did i see a problem now so steve you opened the boxes  yeah you counted ten now there's nine i may have i counted one box saw five and just threw both in 
[02:35:30]  there assuming that there was but both boxes are open though right i did i i didn't like i didn't  do a specific count so i'm you know look if one's missing then one then one's missing if hold on  let me give out the award for worst exclamation ever sorry if one's missing then one's missing  i mean if one's missing then we got a problem but if they only sent nine they only sent nine that's my  that's the point i'm trying to just bring it back tomorrow one's missing no questions asked  policy i mean god damn it yeah were you kidding let's all let's all bring it back let's all put 
[02:36:00]  our heads down on the desk whoever did it just get up put it back put it on the console  no questions asked no one will get in trouble i would guess it's either steve  or will chapman knowing that he's done ah i would guess yeah that's a good point  will taking one going no one's gonna fucking oh really well it's not a thief though he's just  no he's just doing what anybody would fucking do would be 
[02:36:30]  mm-hmm that's right all right well i want will arrested  are you rocky got anything come on here what do you got we know you know the skinny you always do  no he never knows the skinny oh yes jenny all right oh you're right we didn't mean to interrupt  you go ahead no i saw the boxes come into the office right and uh allegedly no i saw them okay  and um they were quickly taken by uh by steve and that was on monday and that was the last i saw 
[02:37:00]  of all of them allegation that's right and then i asked on tuesday your gut thickens  sorry sorry go ahead go ahead blurry camera jesus christ  why don't you have the hubble pointed to our window and take photos when we have a guest  i apologize and then on tuesday i uh will was here and i asked him i said so what happened with the  my views and he said um they didn't believe that the shipment was for us they were for another

[02:38:30]  should not prevent him from keeping his plan  we like mars well things filling up hi thank you and and we know he said that his uh his boy is no  longer with the company but besides that best buds forever the master his best bud do you keep  in touch with uh master poe no not at all no no no not at all i catch mars sometimes spilling out 
[02:39:00]  some of his 40 for him mars were you frustrated that you were connected uh to mars uh to to poe  same thing yeah it is the same thing yeah we all thought these guys were best buds i thought  what they would call asshole buddies when you hang out with somebody long enough you're called an  asshole buddy yeah we saw you were asshole buddies initially we were i know what happened uh just  his antics too much asshole son of buddy yeah he was basically a disappointment you know to you guys 
[02:39:30]  so he did a lot of things that kind of made us look bad so really i detached myself from him now  expect a subpoena in the end i was all right with him to be honest with you okay but he still did a  lot of things mars is just saying that now he was best friends with paul until paul left  i just saw a lot of sam sam he could rip your head off his shoulders i know he learned it  mars is a trained killer too i know poe trained him they're best friends yeah yeah all we gotta do  is train him in technology we'll do a stick fight all right get back to the pal talk why don't we 
[02:40:00]  shut this down we're gonna take a break and we're gonna regroup we got uh dick russell calling or  stopping by stopping it with us he's got a book about the uh it's called trail of the jfk assassins  right it's tough to sell a county book because a lot have been written but i'm interested to hear  anyone have my brother's phone number because my brother uh knows a little something something  about jfk does he did he talk to the warren commission yeah who is he is he the babushka lady

[02:41:30]  to get to stories oh we're very excited big celebrity in the studio pat from munaki everyone pat from  munaki hey everybody now pat uh i heard that you went out for biggest loser yep  stood online for eight hours that's the show i watch actually and i would love to see you on  biggest loser me too and uh i was asking you wait soon as you came in here you're 335 yep which 
[02:42:00]  means you're kind of tiny for biggest loser that might hurt you because there's monsters that are  on that show yeah then what you were saying what a 500 pounder walked by and and everyone was like  what like oh like a big celebrity walked by but i think he would have a good story competitive eater  i know diabetic no toll yeah well i got i got nine of them hey that's why i said no toll you like  our fucking my view box half full huh i look at the foot is half full i heard yeah right yeah we got 
[02:42:30]  that thank you and uh what were you saying what's your chances like uh well they were saying a lot of  people were getting callbacks the same day well like the people that were getting to the second part of  the process yeah but uh i didn't get a call back but i i did get confirmed for my corned beef eating  contest on march 16th at gallagher's steakhouse wow congratulations one door closes another open  another mouth open 
[02:43:00]  did you sure you should have showed him the eggnog drinking contest because you're saying that you still  have a shot if you make a video so we need someone out there that's good at making videos to make  pat's video for biggest loser and maybe you could incorporate the baby bird that might get their  attention yeah i was gonna pull scumbag moving by uh uh one of those flip video things and then  return it when i'm done making a video i love this that did work yeah so who can make the video for  you because you incorporate like the baby bird a little more of your personality i i think you yeah 
[02:43:30]  they want to see your your day right you at work and stuff i guess oh this is me driving  huh this is me crashing because i'm holding the camera here's me here's me crying in my trailer  oh oh it's still uh still in that trailer huh oh yeah that was falling apart like years ago years  ago when we did your cribs episode yeah episode of cribs are the holes getting bigger find that again 
[02:44:00]  uh actually i i got a little motivated and i i threw down some uh like sub flooring on top of the  holes nice very good and uh i got like half my floors covered right and i didn't have the  motivation to continue covering the whole floor yeah who would were you praying that sully uh said  fuck the river and crashed into your uh oh that would have made me famous he was trying to get there  i think i know he was going toward your airport yeah even sully so i said oh is that near munaki i'd  rather crash in a river jesus all right so the biggest loser we're keeping our fingers crossed 
[02:44:30]  i'm not i'm not even a winner at losing  but i think uh maybe with the video maybe you got the last shot at it what else is going on with you  all right oh the economy i was on the bottom rung of the economy when it was doing good  now i'm at the part of the ladder that's in the ground business is a little rough it's never good  but it's really slow uh yeah yeah you don't like seeing uh terms like uh shut out right shut out 
[02:45:00]  notice in your uh notes from your landlord yeah long trouble with the rent hey oh man  how much could the rent be for a trailer at the end of a runway  six hundred twenty dollars not including utilities a month 20 huh yeah but but i got behind in that  and then i i made a stipulation after the legal papers come on my door come on my door 
[02:45:30]  where i was gonna pay them 920 a month until i caught up then i got behind on that and then you  get the how far back are you pretty far back how far i'm not real good at division but uh like  well multiplication over three thousand into oh so you're about three large deep into uh at least  your rent at least and then they throw and when you're late paying money they throw uh late charges  on top yes interest late charges deeper in the hole i go yeah the only reason you you're late is because 
[02:46:00]  you don't have the money so they make it almost impossible for you to catch up pat  insult to injury i call it  i know you uh you do work though right i know so what are you doing with your money that you're not  paying your rent uh not not much i uh actually actually i'm i used to do like a lot of deliveries in  a day but now i'm doing like one delivery a day into the city and well that doesn't sound like it's  very profitable i charge seventy dollars into the city for one delivery what's the what's the name of 
[02:46:30]  your delivery service uh philip and transport but i i changed the name on the side of my van to just  pat from munaki nice name recognition that's your that's your problem branding that's good did you  guys hear that that's your problem seventy dollars for a delivery in the city between the tolls the  gas what kind of money are you making well it's a it's a cutthroat industry a lot of a lot of couriers  they get a lot of deliveries and they'll charge like like uh thirty dollars right because they do a 
[02:47:00]  a bunch of deliveries at one time right right so you're suggesting that other the the potential  customers go elsewhere your business your business model is based on ted's uh delivery emporium right  i have one i deliver one item at a time i go that extra mile it's true we don't have to do the  bit you're doing the business model is ted's delivery emporium i hold it in my lap and fly cross  country you have to pay for airfare and hotel oh my i fold spindle and mutilate 
[02:47:30]  unbelievable pat what are we gonna do oh we could get you some customers just pay the 70 bucks  that's what i need i need deliveries right and you need deliveries back to biggest loser you told them  that you were a true loser yeah down on your luck it's a perfect story for them you don't you can't  afford to eat right and you can't afford to to work out that i need the health care i don't have  that diabetes medication so yeah no you're not taking any diabetes medication no i should be on 
[02:48:00]  a whole slew of medication yeah i should uh yeah i make sugar out of air one time i like didn't eat  for two days then i took my uh blood sugar and was like still in the the 300s that's a lot what's that  about i guess i don't know uh yeah it's supposed to be between uh like 90 and 120. your pancreas is  just pumping that out huh yeah i know why do you have so much sugar why do you have so much blood 
[02:48:30]  sugar because he's a sweet boy look how sweet his face is yeah very sweet looking oh my god you're a  mess i'm just saying i try not to think about it i don't mean you know that way i just mean you know  with the whole the whole package yeah kind of the job thing the the trailer how's the van running  i believe they call that a rut you're in a rut yes the grand canyon yeah oh oh damn i was right 
[02:49:00]  there what are you trying to phrase there huh how are you trying to for you right yeah i was going  grand canyon myself just thinking of natural yeah oh yeah absolutely yes when you think of that you  gotta go right to the great snake river right meteor crater arizona yeah uh oh so you got the  van's running yes run actually i got a uh a relatively new van from fred from brooklyn thank  you oh really he uh yeah he turns over his van he does uh builds chimneys and he like loads a whole 
[02:49:30]  bunch of concrete and shit in his vans yeah and he like turns them over every two years oh that's  good for the car instead of he usually gives the charity and this year those kids with the rusty  wheelchairs will have to go another year one eight seven seven cars for pat yeah one eight  fred knows fred knows his business he's a good businessman he's trying to sell me a chimney i  live on the 40th fucking floor here man i'm like enough with your stupid chimneys i can't buy one 
[02:50:00]  but he keeps trying pat that's the key you can't give him away you gotta watch him you should listen to  50 cents yesterday he's got 50 cents yeah you you have 50 cents and he  i have no sense he was shot one time for every toe you have  nine jokes it's um it's just kind of you know i would think after this many years you might have  found a niche somewhere to kind of get yourself out of this uh yeah position that you're in this 
[02:50:30]  rut i'm not a nicher because  there's uh because there's i i guess there's you know things out there maybe not now it's a little  tough to get a job and everything like that but what made you stick to the delivery industry instead  of maybe going and getting some higher paying job or it's really uh i like doing it like driving  around listening to my music my xm and uh oh good for you yeah who's paying for your xm i am 
[02:51:00]  can we at least get him free xm yeah what the hell please i can't get it  but you have money this fucking guy is nothing well you know what i just spent on a movie theater  uh that's terrible that's kind of sorry pat no it's a valid point though you like to watch big  movies yeah i do i really do well let's see the difference between you two you got you said it  because i'm now saying a quarter million dollar movie theater in your house pat how do you like

[02:52:30]  marissa tomei i saw the trailer thing i'm like wow that's how pat lives right there and he's got hair  but he was living much better than yeah but you live and we really felt sorry for him  it turns out he's not even that guy he's rich i feel my comeback coming real biggest loser yeah  how are we gonna get this done we do we know anyone from mbc they gotta take a good look at this uh  pat and then if you win the whole thing you're rich a couple hundred thousand and then 250 000  250 and then cover the bill on my toe that's exactly how much it costs you're still paying for 
[02:53:00]  you the total no i'm not paying they want a quarter million dollars to drop your toe off yeah i know  you'd think they'd add a toe for that much you know what he makes a good point though they're gonna  take your toe and then you gotta pay 250 i would do it myself tin snips something why not what do they  do that was special all those antibiotics for the three months afterward yeah i'm sure i am yeah  i'm sure pat it's no health insurance right so you had no health insurance no

[03:09:30]  dick there he is there he is in his hand he's got a book uh what's the book it's called on the trail  of the jfk assassins it's a groundbreaking look at america's most infamous conspiracy  you know a lot has been said about uh jfk we've talked about on this show uh a lot of times but um  only in the sense of the airport so i think it's interesting to hear that the president's  ed b but i've kind of leaned against conspiracy theories now uh yeah i don't know what what uh 
[03:10:00]  dick wrote because you turned it into a liberal no i don't know what that means no the liberals  actually are very very pro conspiracy are they but uh yeah i'd be interested to hear what he has to  say yeah we'll do that next pat you sit in the big boy uh chair yes you stay right there and you  help us interview dick russell all right all right read the book i'd say the butler did it  like a what oh jesus christ oh my god he did not that's right why don't you go back to the bleachers  we're back 
[03:10:30]  opi is uh currently in the bathroom and uh i was just chatting with dick russell  were you yes uh on the trail the jfk assassins he also wrote a book called the man who knew too much  which was another kennedy assassination book and he co-wrote uh jesse ventura's book um so we're  just talking briefly about uh i said the longer i've kind of looked into it and the more i've read  the more i doubt conspiracies which is odd because normally you go the other way yeah um yeah because 
[03:11:00]  there's so many theories and uh yeah some of them are viable other ones are plain puppycock well  that's true absolutely true but everybody always says about the conspiracy theory if you just look  at the simplest thing it's probably that and and the simplest thing oh yes thank you uh danny uh  and if that's the case you're talking oswald uh in the uh building uh taking a shot his shots and 
[03:11:30]  then he got him yeah but you know but that there's there's other ways to look at that and the studies  that they've been doing in recent years texas a&m university did one is that there was no way that this  guy firing from behind with a really lousy uh italian weapon a manly carcano rifle could fire three  shots in 6.2 seconds i believe it was and uh and assassinate the president and and you know there's  plenty of evidence i mean oswald was a lousy shot for another thing and there's a lot of evidence that 
[03:12:00]  there were more people more gunmen involved somebody firing from the grassy knoll or maybe even uh the  manhole cover under the under the street i mean can i ask you about that too about the shooting because  they have for a while they've said that you couldn't no no uh marksman had been able to recreate  it but that proved to be incorrect because they've actually have recreated it i mean not under those  perfect conditions and people forget oswald did miss the first shot um and the other argument that's  made is is why didn't he shoot as he was coming towards for the easier shot they raised that in jfk 
[03:12:30]  but you know i mean my guess is simply because the secret service would have seen him you know  you can't fire at a president as he's coming towards you and everybody's looking in your direction  um or you'd be shot well it may be true but you know that there's this so-called the magic bullet  theory as they say yeah sure sure which is you know that uh that the same bullet passed through  kennedy and hit governor connelly sure and connelly himself said that there's no way that that happened  that it was two different you know there were two different bullets and uh you know there's just a  to me it's bullshit i mean it's bullshit the fact that you know they keep putting these the books 
[03:13:00]  that come out like bugliosi's big tome that just came out recently uh regurgitating the  warren commission basically and before that you had uh gerald posner's bookcase closed  i mean these are the only books that get reviewed for one thing the only ones that get a lot of  attention because the big media doesn't want to admit they'd have egg all over their face if they  never investigated this and in fact in some instances set out to cover it up but what about you  oh things like uh they've they've had stuff like um they've had stuff like uh they said that the uh 
[03:13:30]  the house like uh coming on assassinations said that they think that they did hear uh possibly another bullet  but that was from a i believe a a cop microphone a police microphone but now they're saying that  they have the wrong cop motorcycle that the cop motorcycle that they're hearing that's what could  be a shot was actually a mile back um there's a lot of different things i i've heard where they're  saying well yeah this can be recreated um i've just i've gone more against the uh uh the conspiracy  it just seems like highly unlikely there plus there's people in the book depositor on the fifth floor 
[03:14:00]  that heard the shell casings hitting on the floor above them i did not know that i i was surprised  to actually learn that in uh bugliosi's book but there's documented cases in the war commission of  people who are on there was like three or four guys watching from the fifth floor and they heard  the shot coming from above them and the floor look i'm not saying there wasn't somebody prep oswald  himself firing from up there but the fact that he was the lone guy the lone nut as you know firing you 
[03:14:30]  you know it's just there's too much evidence against it and and so there was somebody else  which means a conspiracy firing from some other location i mean and i knew a guy who's dead now  but i knew a guy who worked for the cia and he worked for the russians also uh who was an intelligence  officer who definitely i saw enough and spent enough time with him uh to believe that you know he was  involved with oswald and a couple of cubans cuban exiles actually who were right-wing cubans posing as  castro guys to convince oswald to get into this deal oswald had his own ties to the cia and the fbi 
[03:15:00]  and you know but he was apparently a trotskyite leftist who thought he was gonna do a favor to  castro by uh firing some shots at the president and then he was going to be welcomed in cuba as  a revolutionary hero i mean i knew this guy really well he was involved with you know at least three  other people in in this uh plot and so you know i don't know i wouldn't doubt there was a plot leading  up to it for financing or funding or and all i certainly would not doubt that but i mean the  actual thing where they're talking about the triangulation of crossfire a lot of stuff with 
[03:15:30]  the grassy knoll like there's a very famous uh shot it's a little silhouette uh i guess they call  it black dog man which is which is what it could be looks like a little black dog or whatever and  they say is that the shadow of somebody uh behind the fence in the knoll or wherever and then  they've done computer stuff on it recently where they analyze depth and all that and they say if  that really was a person it'd be two and a half feet tall it's like what a short assassin i know and  a quick little fella but i mean like there's certain computer things that have been done which have  actually worked against like bugliosi's i'm an assassin yeah yeah lee lee the short guy was lee hardly oswald 
[03:16:00]  oh oh that was that was wow oh that was shut up you're in a sass hole  um and and there's one shot you know there's the thing about it the shots came from the front  that was why the neck snapped back and costner made a great thing in jfk about you know what  common sense dictate you know it was it was a great speech but then there's a photo where they capture 
[03:16:30]  kennedy's head actually going forward and the blood shooting forward like it's not just shooting back  into the left back into the left like it looks like it is but there's a photo of his head the moment the  bullet hits him he's leaning forward and it's coming out completely forward the way you'd think  like a like a really talking about the zapruder film yeah there was there was a uh uh whatever  they did with a photo where they uh photo negative it and and you can see kennedy's head what frame  number it was frame number 236 look i don't know what the parkland hospital doctors saw after the 
[03:17:00]  assassination was was very different picture of the wounds than what the official autopsy result later  said when they after they did it at bethesda that night and uh one one of the revelations in my  new book is an interview i did with this guy doug horn who was on the assassination records review  board that was set up after oliver stone's movie came out to review go through all the records and  you know finally get them out to the american people and his specialty was the military stuff he  was one of the people who interviewed the autopsy doctors and what he came to the startling conclusion 
[03:17:30]  actually was that there were this is going to sound crazy but that there were two autopsies that night  there was a there was a and the time frame he talked to a lot of people who the time frame  didn't add up that the the first autopsy happened at 6 35 the official autopsy at eight that little  after eight o'clock but what they did was they altered the the wounds to make it there were orders  from coming from somewhere maybe just to to cover up the fact you know maybe somebody may have been told  you know this was uh but they covered it up by by the autopsy doctors involved actually altering the 
[03:18:00]  the head wounds but see that see i've read that david lifted wrote a book on that called best  evidence where he believed that it was done he didn't know if it was done on air force one back  to dc because there was a couple fbi agents in there uh and they overheard i think it was james  humes the commander hume saying uh appears there's been some surgery to the head area like the the uh who  is the the guy at bethesda who did the autopsy and it just seems like when you look at that logically  and i know that there's certain illogical things that will make things work  who actually like when you look at the war on commission and stuff who actually said 
[03:18:30]  to commander james hume all right look fix the head wound of the president like when you think  about that logically who who said like all right we have to have this be a conspiracy  we have to blame it all on oswald we have to fake the head like who thought through all this in  the first few hours that this happened what if somebody thought in a high high level position back in  those days that even though this wasn't the way it was that the the soviet union communists our 
[03:19:00]  enemy and and cuba had pulled this off and uh they enlisted oswald because he lived in russia  you know he'd maybe been to cuba uh certainly been in mexico city going to the cuban embassy  and it was all made to look that way but uh so what if somebody from the top says you know if this  comes out the truth of this comes out we're going to have world war three now this i do not believe  is what really happened but you could have had people covering it up sending these orders down you  know for all for very benign so-called reasons thinking this was what had gone down and it 
[03:19:30]  really hadn't so i don't think that's something you could rule out but if that if that was the case  um again you've heard how hard it is to keep a secret between five people in a room i mean when you  look at the way information is passed obviously differently now than it was in the 60s but you  look at something like the uh uh abu greb the prison where they were just having prisons do this kind  of stuff and that got out like after all of these years i mean it just doesn't make sense to me or  the warren commission that they would put their their reputations and their legacies on the line 
[03:20:00]  i mean you're dealing with where earl warren was you know met the supreme court like this guy is  actually going to throw his entire life his legacy away because somebody felt it was a good idea to kill  the the acting president like who is co-signing all these people are co-signing for the murder of an  acting president it just doesn't make sense i don't think warren would know you know where it  was coming from necessarily and warren was a good man you know he was a decent man there was one  member of the warren commission senator russell he was sure that that this was bullshit you know that 
[03:20:30]  there was definitely more than one person involved and he didn't sign off on the whole uh you know the  final commission uh conclusion you know who humes the guy you mentioned he admitted he burned his  autopsy note again another because there was blood what i mean that's just you know he was  not what he was not he was not he had never done gunshot wounds before we had michael boden he was  talking about that so he was obviously not qualified right and uh there was a tracheotomy uh incision  made that they thought was uh what would they think it was an entry or an exit wound um that you know 
[03:21:00]  so there's a lot of things that were done by the original parkland doctors that i think that he  wasn't quite sure of what what had happened yeah but he didn't do a good job on the autopsy  it's just amazing that evidence like that would disappear on such something so historic and  uh important that the autopsy notes are gone the autopsy notes are gone the president's brain is  gone so they can't do any further work on that yeah this wasn't a boating accident exactly  well i've heard speculation that uh uh boden did speculate because he was on the uh uh these 
[03:21:30]  the selector for assassinations that uh the brain was actually buried with the body because he said  robert kennedy then they had another ceremony at night where it was only family members that were  involved and they put something else he speculated yeah but yeah but he knows that there was that  other ceremony that most different different people had their own reasons for what they did  and certainly the kennedy family not as a some kind of cover-up but you know just for personal  reasons would have done certain things and you know the fact is i mean so many people hated kennedy  i mean you know he had enemies from uh you know the cubans to the mafia his brother was going 
[03:22:00]  after the mob and putting you know trying to get out of business at the same time that uh you know sam  g and connor was sharing a girlfriend with the president i mean you know there was some  heavy-duty shit speaking of the mob didn't they come out and say they had something to do with  it carlos marcello the head of the new orleans mob he's dead now but yeah there are tapes that  exist that the fbi is finally uh releasing some of them uh there's a new book come out uh that came  out by lamar waldron that gets into some of this it's it's pretty good book um and yeah so he's saying 
[03:22:30]  yeah we we i off the son of a bitch you know this is carlos marcello and he working with uh i'm not  i don't i think the mafia was involved but they were not the uh i don't think the mob has the  wherewithal to cover something like this up all these years where nobody would how many people would  you need though that's a jimmy hoffa yeah that's one guy you know yeah how many people would you  need to cover this up i mean the amount of people you'd need i mean they were implicating the dallas  police department i mean the amount of people you would need to co-sign this and never unsign it 
[03:23:00]  is mind-boggling i don't know if it is i mean it wouldn't have to be a monumentally large  conspiracy involving a whole lot of people it would have to be commander hume's he would have  had to been involved in a cover-up okay if they cover up conspiracy of it commander hume's it would  have to be whatever superior gave him the order it would have to be i mean who else would have to be  involved in this i mean uh the people certainly people at the fbi um and there were people at the cia  in other words well here's the deal oswald worked with a lot of these different agencies 
[03:23:30]  so they're covering their ass uh the fbi and certainly the cia in terms of the relationship  they've had in the past with oswald because you know the cia sent him to russia um and the military  you know i mean there's all these kind of tentacles and interconnections where it's not that you had to  be involved in a conspiracy to kill the president but they had the perfect guy the perfect he said i'm  a patsy i'm a patsy it's he stood up there before he was shot by ruby and said that so maybe he felt he  he was said i'm sorry i apologize maybe maybe he felt that he was a patsy because other guys had 
[03:24:00]  put him up to it and now he was going to take the fall he's going to take the right as opposed to  there's other shooters um which again i wouldn't doubt that but he could be i'm a patsy because uh  you know these guys put me up to it i don't say that there was nobody in the government involved  in me setting it up but i'm saying the cover-up to me is so improbable because the amount of people  you would have needed to be involved all you would have to do though is convince those people that are  involved that to cover it up is in the national interest um and like that's right like you were 
[03:24:30]  saying sure for national security if if somebody from upstairs says hey look you know if word gets  out that the russians had anything to do with killing our president we're going to war that's  exactly what i'm saying yeah that's what you're saying before uh so you don't necessarily have to go  look we all killed the president here we were involved so you got to keep quiet and alter this  or do that you just got to say look the president was shot he was killed there were people that are 
[03:25:00]  involved that could be linked to certain communist organizations even up to the soviet union the  kremlin um let's avert war we saw what happened with the cuban missile crisis let's you know take  care of this just switch this around a little bit keep your mouth shut and then you know those people  don't really have a reason to think well you know uh i think they were involved in his actual death  more so than a conspiracy in the cover-up or yeah or if i can just say or you got the cia you know 
[03:25:30]  at a high level or the military saying oh my god here's this guy we thought you know we worked we  were working him yeah we sent him to russia he came back we thought we had a handle on him we had  control over him and somebody else must have got to him or maybe he's fooling us they look real bad  then the fbi by the way would have thrown them to the wolves because the fbi and the cia typically  work terribly together and they would no one would love to see someone get dicked more than one of  those organizations oh yeah sure 9-11 happened because they weren't working it's almost like 
[03:26:00]  even in this age of where technologically information is passed so well they couldn't  work well enough to prevent 9-11 from happening because they just don't share information  contest it's territoriality absolutely power plays it's it's all that stuff and and that existed  back then if if uh yeah an organization if the fbi found out that the cia was working with oswald  and oswald shoots the president they'd be like what the yeah how stupid are you guys that you didn't see  this coming yeah you know and he had somebody like hoover running the fbi who yeah always hated the cia 
[03:26:30]  and he was his own little fife to me been in power since the 1920s always looking for another way to  hold something over someone's head to keep his balls on clive tolson's nose yeah exactly  he was he was he was this closet gay guy who kept secrets on everybody else and threatened to expose  them and i know for a fact that he was warned he was told in september of 63 by this guy that i wrote  about in my first book richard nagel and again in this on the trail jk's eric nagel richard nagel  was he a great big fat person cheating of course no he was told hoover was warned and given enough 
[03:27:00]  information to warrant the arrest of oswald and these two cuban exiles and he didn't do it so  he's covering his own ass then too because uh you know what happens to him if that comes out and he  wanted to he was going to get he was going to lose his job too if jfk got re-elected in 64 oh yeah  they were going to get they were going to dump him you know which finally you know he he lasted  through uh through nixon and died in the side now your uh your book on the trail of the jfk  can i ask one question before yeah would they really have fired hoover with all he knew about people 
[03:27:30]  well they were questioned that's why he i know that's why he had so much but there was talk of  that yeah there was talk of what what what are you uh getting at in this book like what's your uh  high angle do you think you're just oswald no no i'm kidding yeah i'm joking  my hype i mean you know this book covers a lot of different ground i spent years since the 1970s i  spent two years solid as a probably the first investigative journalist in the country you  know going around interviewing as many people as i could and um certainly some of them i've i 
[03:28:00]  later discovered were bullshit artists you know i'd listen to somebody's story at first i'd believe  him and then i'd you know compare it and think you know this guy's right right full of shit he's  making this up and uh but there were a few people that i i met that i really felt hey you know there's  there's something to this and one of them was this guy nagel another was antonio vachana this cuban exile  so in this book i kind of just track my own journey part of it's a memoir part of it's you know articles i  published years ago and part of it's new evidence that i uncovered along the way so uh you know it's 
[03:28:30]  it's it's really a story of my life on the trail as and some of it was very strange it must be hard  to come up with new evidence on something that's been gone over with such a fine tooth comb as they  call it uh you know what what type of uh what type of new evidence have you come up with well a lot  of this i developed back in the 70s for example so that's closer to the one that this really happened  in 63 and uh the the main guy that i believed was was richard nagel who had a he was it's a very  strange story he walks into a bank in el paso texas on the 20th of september 63 two months before 
[03:29:00]  the assassination he shoots two holes in the ceiling he intentionally gets himself arrested and placed in  federal custody the fbi finds among other things in his trunk some notebooks one of these notebooks  which i saw before i ever met him had amazingly similar listings to the notebook that they took from  oswald after he was arrested for fair play for cuba committee the cuban embassy mexico city i mean  clearly the guy bore some looking into so anyway i track him down um i had this weird relationship 
[03:29:30]  with him i mean i oh not that he was he was a very reluctant to talk uh he was suing the government to  try to get something out of him i was at the time i i ended up going out to l.a to work for tv guide  actually as a staff writer in the hollywood bureau so i'd meet this guy in dingy bars at night and  i travel around with bob hoped or something during the day you know it was an odd combination  it was an odd combination but uh anyway he would never tell me everything he knew but what he did  tell me was enough you know he talked about the fact that he had been involved eventually with oswald 
[03:30:00]  in this conspiracy there have been several earlier plots to kill kennedy uh that he knew about the  russians he was a double agent cia soviet deal uh and the russians had him tracking both oswald and  these assassination plots and then they all came together in the summer of 63 it was the russians  he said who ordered him to either convince oswald he was being set up that this was a phony deal or  kill him kill oswald in mexico city uh you know a couple months before the assassination instead of 
[03:30:30]  doing that he sends warning letter to hoover he lets his people at the cia know what's going down and  he takes himself out of the whole deal by walking into this bank in texas and they railroad this guy  through prison for four and a half years i mean it was you know he was just like salted away and um  when i knew him i think he used me you know i think you know he was i was kind of it was kind of  carrot and stick thing he was he was talking to uh the military and saying you know if you don't  if you don't give me what i want this full disability pension i'm going to tell this uh  hot shot journalist yeah yeah everything i know and then uh open up this can of worms so but nick if 
[03:31:00]  everybody's so scared of um the big thing was people didn't talk because they were afraid for their  lives that was one of the things yeah um so but then in the other thing what what kind of a guy  would try to hold it over the head of the military he had stuff salted away if there was that that he  had he okay he told me a very first meeting he said i've got stuff put away that they know that in  the event of my untimely demise you know it's going to come out well what finally happened was he did  have an untimely demise in 1995 the the uh jfk records review board finally they just they were they 
[03:31:30]  subpoenaed him and they were gonna you know go talk to him get his records the very day that that  subpoena arrived in his mailbox in la he's found dead too and um you know interesting yeah i mean  one of a number of people that we can look that up by the way yeah you can look that up and uh  and so i get a call about this and i was pretty fucked up about it i mean you know yeah yeah i  thought well geez i just gave this talk the review board you know uh they they're going after this guy  finally and now he's dead you know and and uh it was sad man i i knew his uh son and they were 
[03:32:00]  estranged so i ended up breaking the news to the son and then the you know the police go out there  to la and they cordoned off his house and the review board people go out there and it was to uh  it was in the house that he had these trunks salted away in a in a storage area in tucson arizona so the  kid he wasn't really a kid anymore but he's grown you know son goes there and there were supposed to  be nine trunks and one of them the purple trunk he had said you know this is the one that's got the 
[03:32:30]  the stuff in it well when they got there in arizona the purple trunk the only trunk that  was the only trunk that was missing so you know nothing ever surfaced in terms of the evidence  that he said that he had salted away that was going to come out in the event of his death he  was supposedly a heart attack and uh you know the all that's what the autopsy said but i also you  know from some of my research know that heart attacks can be induced intelligence agencies know how  to do that so when you look at all that stuff all the cloak and dagger and all the things that would 
[03:33:00]  have to line up right for this to still be i guess a secret which includes hume's lying to his teeth  risking his military career lying to at the uh house uh select committee on assassinations uh all of  these things how is all of these these different things lining up and working harder to believe or  easier to believe then oswald got two shots at a prior a little bit better than he should have been  able to get like how is you understand what i mean like how is it to believe and and and that 
[03:33:30]  oswald just that this long uh so many people and this comes up a lot it's like so many years go by and  no one says anything and this people do say things and i think as time goes by it's harder for people to  have any credibility on it yeah because you could get somebody that was involved you know old as dirt  right now saying yes i know it was a conspiracy this that the other thing and and people just kind of 
[03:34:00]  go yeah all right whatever and a lot of it's almost easier to keep a conspiracy um uh under wraps the  longer it goes on it almost becomes legend instead of uh factual it's like oh the legend of this  conspiracy so it doesn't matter what you tag on it it's still just this fake thing the real the  real thing is what they told you was real and a lot of people are dead i mean you know we're talking  yeah yeah five years so you know certainly the older people are all gone and and and over the 
[03:34:30]  years a lot of people have died quote mysterious deaths i mean these have been documented starting  way back with dorothy kilgallen the columnist she interviews jack ruby says i'm going to blow the lid  off this whole thing and then she's she shows up dead in her apartment as a supposed suicide i mean  people that i interviewed over the course of time i mean they ended up dead and uh or shot i mean  there was this cuban exile in miami antonio vecchiana and i when i first met him i didn't know he even knew  anything you know and he's i'm sitting there with him in the trailways bus station a member in miami  says let me see your your government card i said i have a government card i'm a journalist he says okay 
[03:35:00]  so i finally convinced him i'm not with the government and then he starts telling me this amazing story  that that he was telling the house uh committee investigating this at the time that he's  you know he was working for the cia uh all these plots to kill castro and his case officer  for the cia who he called mr bishop uh he said calls him to a meeting in august of 63 and there's  this young guy sitting there for the whole meeting well it's lee harvey oswald now that doesn't prove  conspiracy uh to kill the president but you know it was pretty startling story and he's talking about  this and he's talking about to the house committee and there's this big guy david phillips who looks 
[03:35:30]  like as mr bishop and who was a high-level cia guy all right so what happens is a couple years go by and  uh all of a sudden actually outside that same trailways bus station uh i get a call one day  that vichyana has been shot in the head now you know it could be he has lots of enemies the cuba  natural community and all that but you know after that he lived but you know he he shut up basically  he didn't want to talk anymore and i just move over to the uh right here a little by the window and  leave a little opening between the building the building across the way and you 
[03:36:00]  i thought i was being said i don't want yeah some guy just went yeah all right the dopey  shock jock just moved well there were also plus it wasn't just the uh uh the zapruder film there  were other shots uh the next film i i i think was that which were taken from the other side um and  there was a couple of other films that were taken of the assassination from the other side that kind of  showed the knoll and uh something that somebody raised one time made a lot of sense after the 
[03:36:30]  shots rang out and all hell broke loose people ran towards the grassy knoll and what logical person  in a shooting runs towards the gunshots what group especially a couple of renegades maybe but what group  fearfully runs for their lives towards where the shots are coming from but if you look at the pictures  i mean those people had heard something over there yeah i mean the president's just been shot 
[03:37:00]  you know and they figure what's well what the what maybe sometimes the echo it could sound like it's  coming from somewhere else yeah that's true too you know yeah you hear that you don't know where it's  really coming from so and a crowd that big you're gonna get chicken without their with their heads  cut off kind of running all over the place but yeah but it's it's it's like you know it's it's the  echoes could play into it but if the echoes did anything they would make it sound more like it was  coming from the knoll than not um and they're implying that there was people running towards  the knoll because they heard shots yeah that's been a very common conspiracy some people have said 
[03:37:30]  that some people who were interviewed have talked about the fact that they thought they heard something  coming from there and that's a pruder film you know there's some interesting questions about that  um in the the interview i did with this guy doug horn for the for my book um he says that what he  discovered was that any this they these people called him up the assassination records review board and he said  you know i want to tell you something about there's a pruder film because i was involved in the in its transfer  uh that it was taken that weekend of the assassination from dallas to a photo lab in rochester new york that 
[03:38:00]  was run by kodak but it was also a cia front and uh that that the pruder film was altered that weekend  you know through these very sophisticated techniques that they had of i don't know exactly how they did it  but the weekend it happened yeah do you think though when you look at that public didn't see that for five  years more than that so logically would they really alter it or just destroy it if that showed something  why wouldn't they have just destroyed it and said film didn't come out there's no internet back then 
[03:38:30]  there's no information passed away it is today nobody would have it would have been this guy named  abraham yeah saying no it wasn't destroyed they would have said we overexposed it by accident sorry  well you make a good point but you know dan rather for example he wasn't with cbs yet uh he was local  state he'd already seen the film what he described actually about seeing the zapruder film was very  different than what what the final conclusion was he talked about what he's talking about is it seems to  be an extra frame you know as far as where the president's uh head moves but um you know yeah you got 
[03:39:00]  a point but but the i don't know zapruder had already signed a deal with life magazine which started out at  50 grand after the weekend it ended up 150 grand where they bought the film rights a lot of money  in those days 1963 and uh you know that so that that seems like the chain of custody that he signed  documents indicating the film was still in dallas but actually it had been taken to new york but to  think also too that they would know exactly what frame in that short a period of time not knowing  where public opinion would go uh the warrant commission had not been released yet so to think 
[03:39:30]  that in that first week or so they would have the foresight to go you know what that implies conspiracy  this implies lone gunman let's remove that frame it just it the foresight you'd have to see to pull  that off it would just be to me non-existent if you look at the film and and you see clear evidence  that the president shot from the front and you know that the official verdict is it's he's been  shot from the rear and that's what that's what is going to be said this one guy did it who's about  to be dead on sunday um you know then why not i mean you've got people who are pretty smart who can 
[03:40:00]  look at these things and you know with technical expertise and figure that out but zapruder's never said  this film has been offered uh oh no no he would and and paid a lot of money it's been it's been  it's been documented so many times it's been seen so many times it's been run through modern computers  so many times i think that's something that would have been especially i'm sure the cia could do a  good job but in 1963 what they could do to splice film i'm sure could be picked up now uh the way we  can look at things especially when they had they had the release version with the extra spra i mean that  would have been uncovered well maybe so but uh you know that film was salted away by life magazine 
[03:40:30]  by time life for like 15 well 12 years anyway it wasn't wasn't shown and uh they said you know  it would cause too much uh it was just too painful to see and i've always wondered about it because  you know the media uh time life at that time had this guy cd jackson who was the publisher of life  and he he's you know he clearly had he was connected to the cia in the 50s i mean you know you've got  people like that very strong links between the the intelligence agency and the media that seems like 
[03:41:00]  everybody uh had some kind of links to the cia or the yeah the cubans or russia or something was  going on yeah the tentacles were everywhere yeah yeah and um but you know the media to this day has  really not uh devoted a lot of time or attention to at least trying to look into the conspiracy uh  possibilities oh i don't know i think that there's so much has been done about it like when you look at  book the oc raise and again i don't say that he's the only voice at all but he's just one of the  the the fewer voices that's that's well respected from the oswald uh loan gunman theory was that jfk 
[03:41:30]  wore a back brace which acted almost as a girdle uh because he had a very very bad back and there's  a weird they said that kennedy's problem may have been the reason he actually died may have been  because he couldn't fall because if you watch when he gets shot he he's leaning down and there's an  awkward way his arms are up at his neck um and they it's like he probably couldn't fall because  he had a back brace on which you know in milliseconds allowed that neck shot to pop him in the head but 
[03:42:00]  very possibly if he didn't have that back brace on he would have gotten hit uh uh blasted his throat  out he may have died anyway right but he just fell over uh immediately and that that shot may not have  popped him in the head well you know we could go on arguing and debating the technical merits of this  forever i mean and i'm not i'm not going to claim to be an expert in the forensics and the bullets and  all that kind of stuff that wasn't my my thing that wasn't what i did some people have really done some  great uh look at that looking at that and like david lifton and others but you know i went out and i 
[03:42:30]  interviewed all these people and as i say just missed a lot of their stories but i just you know i just  encountered too much i mean too many people with uh really credible information i felt that that  indicated oswald had intelligence ties again that doesn't prove that you know he didn't do it by himself but  it certainly leads to leads to the inescapable conclusion that uh we have not been told the  truth about who oswald was what he was up to he was dealing with and why not you know that's what 
[03:43:00]  and i think it's still really important that we know i agree it was a very uh secretive time uh  back then uh during the cold war and and people did tend to especially the press keep their mouths shut  uh when when things especially were told that it would affect national security so uh it could you  know dealing with a whole nother uh time now forget about it it would be uh all over the all over the  news yeah i'm sure people that love it the press didn't didn't get into kennedy's dalliances or his 
[03:43:30]  yeah yeah exactly there'd be there'd be 8 000 uh camera shots different angles cell phone cams going off  things like that uh but you know you got one film and some still pictures and uh people that could  really make up whatever kind of story they wanted uh back then yeah and the way i look at it is you  know something stopped that day i mean in the american consciousness psyche there was this wound you know  like in the in the national psyche and uh and we weren't told the truth about it for on whatever level 
[03:44:00]  you want to look at it and uh and therefore you know it led to other things i mean i i've looked a  little bit at the other assassinations of the 60s at bobby kennedy and martin luther king and malcolm  rex you know the to me the four great men were cut down uh were supposed to believe all by you know  lone assassins and um not x though there's a couple right yeah yeah there were but i mean was that a  conspiracy you know were there other people involved was there's there was a whole probably the nation 
[03:44:30]  yeah the nation of islam yeah the nation of islam for sure but maybe the cia too i mean there's been  a whole book written about that that i read i've never investigated it but but you know so you have  a sea change happens in the 1960s when these four people are are shot and and you know the reason i  spent as much time as i have looking into it and writing about it is because i think it's still vitally  important for where we are today you know as a country and for our kids and you know here we got a  a new president uh who's really looking to change things and much in the way that kennedy was and 
[03:45:00]  you know we need to we need to look at these things and and come come clean about it and get to the  truth of what happened there and move on there are some people though that are so easy to snap to  conspiracy and i think 9-11 showed that because there are some uh so many websites and uh people that  just you cannot convince them that it was hijackers hated the uh american way of life hated what we had  done in the world and wanted to just wreak havoc on us and did it uh they the claims of of dynamite uh 
[03:45:30]  of being put in the trade center to bring it down in a controlled explosion things like that people seem  to just gravitate toward conspiracy during these very uh traumatic moments i think to give them  uh a little more control and relief the fact that like oh my god i hate to think that this could just  happen without this great huge plan behind it because that means we're very vulnerable makes them 
[03:46:00]  feel safer yeah we're very vulnerable to just you know a group of islamic uh uh militants or is it's  got to be this wide ranging conspiracy well lone gunman can fuck up the whole country by taking out  the president no it's got to be this big thing we hate to think we're so vulnerable that one nutty  guy or a couple of nutty extremists can can wreak such havoc on us well i think we're more vulnerable  if it's if some of these things really are results of conspiracies because then who is it you know and 
[03:46:30]  what's going on that's true yeah yeah yeah but that's what i mean like the truth of the matter is  though especially with something like 9 11 um i i you have to look at what happened and and honestly  well you do but even with 9 11 even with 9 11 you know i'm not a big believer in the whole buildings  were blown up from inside i've read about this stuff but you know the bush administration they knew  they had all kinds of evidence that they ignored oh yeah yeah there's that stuff but i mean in any 
[03:47:00]  situation uh you know things that have gotten us into wars uh pearl harbor for one is one of the more  well-known one uh those they had intelligence uh they didn't use it it always seemed to be kind of a  just human error kind of a thing then let's just not you know let's just not uh let people on to  this maybe let's look the other way when you i'm sorry when you do use your intel the intelligence you  have and you start bothering people and saying don't do this all of a sudden you're called a police 
[03:47:30]  state you know there's no winning it's like there's been nothing that's happened in this country since  then um and obviously you know the gloves kind of came off and the politeness had to go out the  window but when you do that uh uh people get angry and go what are you fascist like you you really  can't win yeah yeah so if you if you use the information that you've gotten covertly which is  how a lot of good info has gotten you use it and people accuse you of being you can't win secretive  why don't you sell congress there's a covert uh investigations and uh infiltrations of this 
[03:48:00]  that and the other thing well that's how we get our our best information to protect the country and  yeah well yeah with this though of course it really played into the hands of the neocons i mean let's  face it you know it allowed them to create this iraq war uh and claim that's you know these false  claims that i was right right to do it and then we we go in on completely false pretenses both the  weapons of mass destruction and the fact that maybe hussein was collected and connected to 9-11 which he was not  so it gave these guys you know uh and premature i guess is one word to to go in and do whatever  the fuck they want well i will say i don't think weapons of mass destruction i think that was just 
[03:48:30]  bad intelligence otherwise they never would have left colin powell swinging like a if it was a cover  story i don't think it wasn't a terrible decision but if it was a cover story they would have put  something better together than something that was so easily shown to not be if you're going to make  a conspiracy or something just plant things there they would have planned to say you know who's  going to argue but tried in nigeria i think it's a terrible idea i mean colin powell you couldn't  be more he was hung out to dry oh yeah the whole the whole public opinion changed after that like 
[03:49:00]  yeah it was so counterproductive when it very easily could have not been had they just you know  yeah it turned and it wasn't even an acknowledgement of okay we we screwed up on our intelligence and we're  changing the whole mo of this war to free the people of iraq uh it just like morphed into this  other purpose that americans didn't give a shit about if it was a fact that he had weapons of mass  destruction and intended on using them on us or our allies uh that's what we were all gung-ho rah rah 
[03:49:30]  let's go in there and take this guy out if it's hey we want these people to have the freedom that we  have i would never have signed off on anything like that and the american people wouldn't have  either sacrificed our guys for a freedom that they're not worth uh willing to fight for yeah  look at how many people have been killed over there both our guys and you know thousands hundreds of  thousands of iraqi it's ridiculous i i think you know saddam knew exactly how to take care of his 
[03:50:00]  people if they wanted to rise up and and fight for their own freedom that was their business that guy  though there were no there were no uh infighting uh between uh you know sunnis and he knew how to  keep them under an iron fist and to think you could just wheel in and make a democracy out of  something because you screwed up on this weapons thing uh really was a dumb dumb move but i think  the important thing is the woman who should have been shot in the kennedy assassination is the woman who 
[03:50:30]  was on the i think it was fifth or fourth floor of the book depository and had a video you probably  know her name i don't remember her name she had a video camera she was from oswald's perspective  she was filming the motorcade and this dumb broad didn't know how to use the video camera so as  the assassination is happening she's filming the trees oh i've heard about that can you see that  video oh yes you can the trees are lovely she didn't know what she was doing she probably panicked  when shots were ringing out and you know she's watching the president be killed but what was 
[03:51:00]  that what was the i should know this but they made the turn on elm coming from yeah from houston  houston okay she's filming the motorcade coming and she had the view oh she was behind kennedy  while he was being assassinated from oswald's perspective and this fucking broad didn't know  how to use the man's equipment she's in the same window oswald's hanging out of excuse me pardon me  because his elbow moved her camera and she didn't notice it this camera's messing my hair she was 
[03:51:30]  really out of it but you know what i mean have you ever seen the footage it's no it makes you  you want to find her and set her on fire dad are you on youtube looking oh damn that's that's  terrible so dick you obviously believe uh you go you go behind the scenes and get some stuff like  not just the shooting evidence but the stuff that led up to it yeah exactly you know witnesses people who  were like i say involved with oswald in one way or another uh also i look in the book and it's a 
[03:52:00]  it's some pretty far out stuff but at the possibility that oswald you know you know remember this program  called mk ultra you ever hear of it well it was back in the 70s that it came out the senate hearings  that the cia had this program to control human behavior called mk ultra and they've been working  on it for more than 20 years is that like manchurian candidate stuff yeah exactly um and uh that they were  using hypnosis and drugs and trying to create uh assassins and there's documents about this this  is you know proven stuff and in the book i i interviewed a couple of guys um one was sid 
[03:52:30]  godlieb who ran that program for years another was ike feldman who was a case you know cia uh case  officer in the program and without going into all the details but but feldman said yeah there'd been  without being specific and both of them you know indicated there'd been rumors or you know they'd  heard things that maybe oswald and even ruby could have been uh as he put it uh you know doped or uh  you know given something before the assassination i mean oswald's behavior was really weird after he  was arrested you know he was very cool and calm and collected and and and very very strange i remember 
[03:53:00]  his brother came to visit him in prison one story is and or in jail that weekend and then it looked in  his eyes and oswald said uh you won't you won't find anything there oh really yeah and there's  there's a lot of circum circumstantial but you know the the air base at sugi where he was in japan was  one of the two field stations overseas where they used had did lsd experiments in those days on on  soldiers um and he went to russia and you know they they put him in this hospital for 10 days i mean 
[03:53:30]  there's really weird stuff goes on with him in the in the years before you know immediately he has a  tremendously interesting past for a guy 23 yeah i mean yeah for a guy 23 the his past is amazing so  much uh intrigue and and cloak and dagger and and uh you know to this day you don't know where his  loyalties lied um as far as the communists go and and uh this country and and and the president that 
[03:54:00]  cuba it really is amazing that there was that much going on in this guy's life and then he turns out  to be the you know guy shoots the president it is it's really yeah there's even you know i had a  guy phil corso he was an intelligence guy national security advisor to eisenhower and stuff and he told  me that uh he said he worked for senator russell investigating warren commission stuff he said you  know he says i and we found out that there were two oswalds that this guy you know that there were  two of them came back from russia a look-alike who was working for the russians and then this other 
[03:54:30]  guy had been over there i mean you even get to that you know who's in the grave i mean it's very yeah  right bizarre i write about that some in the book too that is uh just uh an amazing history he had  uh uh before the assassination or and even after i mean that ruby coming up and just hey hello here  you go take this with you yeah and ruby of course had ties to the mob and yeah yeah all that i was  surprised that there was so much um uh photographic coverage of of oswald before the assassination like 
[03:55:00]  him handing out pamphlets and uh a lot of um uh film and back then you know it wasn't like everybody  had a camera but what if somebody's setting him up i mean that's what i mean yeah yeah that's a  little odd too that there he is handing out these communist pamphlets and it's on film it's him doing  interviews he calls and wants to make sure the tv station's there and yeah yeah to cover him and  they do they come out there and then they interview him and and there he is with a gun 
[03:55:30]  yeah his picture with the gun yeah right that it's just there are very convenient things uh when it  comes to oswald uh that that he was the perfect patsy in that sense yeah yeah he really was i  mean if if it was a lone gunman thing and it just was him doing it boy he would have been a perfect  patsy if if it was a setup yeah because he had everything you needed don't forget there wouldn't  have been that photographic a lot of that photographic evidence might have just been  because he was involved with these these uh anti-government organizations right it was probably 
[03:56:00]  natural for them to track and photograph these groups anyway i mean it was saying it was right but  they did uh yeah record of these people anyway could be but there did seem to be a lot for just  some you know he was putting himself out there kid uh handing out some commie stuff yeah he was he  was kind of making propaganda here's lee harvey's handing out a pamphlet yeah and excuse me  i love the fact that what ed grant bombs yeah i said i was gonna say ed i meant to say 
[03:56:30]  a high note yeah yeah i guess it's 11 20 or something yeah let's let's you should be tumbling  out of the enola gay all right the book is called it's uh dick russell and the book is on the trail  of the jfk assassins and um it covers some different angles that have been covered before and um  i feel nauseous but not because of your book thank you no no no i ate i drank coffee and then a  grapefruit and a combination yeah a little acid and uh caffeine to get it into your system that's 
[03:57:00]  good maybe you knew too much maybe it's not uh the coffee yeah i see the guy in the window over  there yeah yeah who who got you the grapefruit is it club soda canny where does he who does he work  for exactly he doesn't even know g-h g-h club soda coming all right there you go back yeah stop i'm  back i'm turning your mic off so yeah yeah you're a patsy from monaki 
[03:57:30]  uh this is good right on very very interesting i mean anything you could get your uh hands on as far  as the jfk thing but this is um uh insightful in the way that uh you talk to a lot of these people  and uh it's not so much uh the technical let's get some strings and line up where the bullets go  things it's it's talking with the people and that's a that's a pretty good angle i like that  thanks good to be with you today all right dick thank you dick russell everyone and uh i guess that's
