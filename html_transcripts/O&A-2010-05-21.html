<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with in-studio guest James Norton discussing his friend's newborn baby, leading to humorous anecdotes about parenthood and Anthony's aversion to fatherhood.  The conversation then shifted to regrets in life, briefly touching upon Adolf Hitler's personality and habits.  Norton recounted a Twitter incident where he was accused of racism for a tweet about a Hispanic power washer, detailing his sarcastic responses and the frustrations of online negativity.  He compared online interactions to stand-up heckling, sharing a tearful anecdote from his early stand-up days.  The discussion included video games, specifically *Red Dead Redemption* (with a funny story about Norton being shot in-game by Danny), *Portal*, and the differences between PC and console gaming.

The show continued with a discussion about the social aspects of console gaming versus PC gaming and the annoyance of friends knowing what you're watching on streaming services.  This transitioned into a reminiscence about the limitations of VHS tapes and video rentals compared to the ease of accessing older shows and movies via streaming, with humorous commentary on shows like *21 Jump Street* and *Quincy*.  The hosts discussed the drawbacks of on-demand streaming, such as decreased attention spans, and criticized a Jamie Lee Curtis Activia yogurt commercial.  Audio quality issues with a *Quincy* clip were noted, followed by playing and discussing a clip featuring an impassioned speech from the show.

The broadcast then included a gossip segment about George Lopez and an escort, focusing on the escort's decision to publicly reveal details of their encounter. The hosts discussed the perceived betrayal of professional discretion and compared it to historical perspectives on such encounters.  The show concluded with a pre-recorded comedic bit, "Adventures in Docking," a humorous phone interview with a man discussing his experiences and urological procedures related to a specific sexual practice.  Opie and Anthony commented on the caller's awkwardness and the success of the themed radio segment.

[00:05:30]  keep the stupid bloodline going like who cares oh who cares keep this wreck going you don't care  about you don't care about the kumia lineage no no my brother and sister have like kids so at some  point it keeps going but my brother's is uh a female was not a masculine child so uh you know the 
[00:06:00]  name apparently there was uh you know he's gone unless he has a son he's not gonna he got snipped  did he really oh yeah one and done one get me out of here that's what he said and i'm done so you know  will i regret it later in life how much more later is there tell you the truth but will i  it's a nice way to look at it it's just one of those things it's like a great way to keep your 
[00:06:30]  chin up and look for the future like i know i know when i was just fucking up by the numbers in high  school and everybody was like you know you should go you're gonna regret it later in life and and  there was a point i did right because i regretted it i'm looking back and everybody's you know going  to college and and doing things that are good and look important and i'm installing above the ground  swimming pools i kind of thought like maybe they were right i should have stayed maybe i should have 
[00:07:00]  stood in school uh i think you think like oh am i gonna regret this laying on that fucking deathbed  no one around just just laying there doing a death rattle alone alone just handing money out to  people to come and make believe they're my friends take a 50 off the bureau before you leave  like hitler in the bunker they hear a shot and light cigarettes because they weren't allowed to smoke 
[00:07:30]  down there oh is that what happened yeah right after the shot they all just lit up he didn't like  him no cigarettes are unhealthy why would he like that he was a vegetarian oh that's right he was  yes odd morality yeah i know do you like animals uh yeah seems he was uh you know he did like uh  animals loved his dog yes very tender gentleman well well you know i wouldn't say that across the board 
[00:08:00]  no not across the board there were inconsistencies i understand that he had a bit of a temper  yeah yeah um would be would be a time short with people could could have been killed six million  people um was also uh quick and judgmental yes yes yes he uh he was indeed all of those things  um but so much more yeah such a deeper person we got into that last time i don't think maybe i  think this time i'll leave the praising of adolf hitler alone today you really are trying to take 
[00:08:30]  genocide and make lemonade but uh yeah you wonder you know if you're gonna regret things like that  not having kids like that i can't and i'm not i'm not sitting here getting sentimental or or  thinking about it like i'm just not i can't do it the thought of of my life being turned topsy-turvy  for a kid just uh drives me insane gives me anxiety thinking about it yeah it's too much 
[00:09:00]  it's too much inconvenience it's you know too much work the responsibility of making sure you're forming  a human being that works in society right is just a little too much for me i'm barely functional  how the hell am i supposed to you know be the one that that raises a kid so it works i just don't  want to do it it's not that holding a baby is fun and it's like it really you know it's cute and it's  like i understand the attraction to being a parent but well i'm done in 10 minutes like not that i don't 
[00:09:30]  want to i could be around the kid but i don't want this to be my life i'm not yeah i'm not ready to  commit this much no you're a good guy you're on planes you're you're out on the road automobiles  yeah uh boats what other what else we got skateboards yeah higher balloons rocket ships  dirigibles backs of fat girls backs of fat men  so the baby is he's very very uh full head of hair too already does it really what color is it 
[00:10:00]  um i mean the baby oops he's white i cross myself thank god teasing of course sir  uh yeah he hopes he's got like a reddish hair but i'm not good at judging hair color like that  can't tell a little east side dave in them not quite no it's like carrot heads you don't want  that no not at all uh for red you kind of want strawberry blonde kind of a thing i guess and then 
[00:10:30]  it turns blondish as they get older because uh man that big head of red east side davish curly hair  i mean yeah he it's it's the ronald mcdonald syndrome you don't want that happening to your kid  yeah just that bright red clownish you just know it's a life of having the piss beat out of you in  school and being called names which is like that goes beyond the whole parenting thing too  like you can't even control what happens you raise the kid up until it goes to school 
[00:11:00]  and now you're you're out of the loop you could have done a great job and it'll get all fucked up  because three kids in class decided they can make up a cool name for him and you know fuck with his  head now your little kids being bullied coming home crying yeah his his red hair that you secretly  hate is all punched in right oh just black eye yeah there's a there's a shade of red that's very 
[00:11:30]  cool on girls too yeah yeah i mean it just becomes like a short just carrot orange color you don't want  that no i can't respect that you ever been with a um a real redhead yeah i mean i've pretty much  covered every base all the bases yeah everything they can have on their head fucking horns a dunce cap  a mo howard wig hockey helmet  yeah if it's been on their head i'll fuck them 
[00:12:00]  yeah uh well yeah i'm i just um i couldn't handle that i'm too irresponsible i um i got a nice twitter  war yesterday for a little while just a little while i don't i don't i don't tweet a lot i'm not  like uh i just started following the great wonderful colin quinn so i um and there is a man  that seems to tweet a lot i am colin quinn yes i am colin quinn and uh don't get me wrong funny as

[00:13:00]  much he talked as we went to iraq to it together he just yaps he's a yapper he fucking babbles and all  of his uh all of his his tweets are um very just off the top of his head shit about what's happening  in the world and the news yeah in his life on twitter yeah he goes congrats valerie bertinelli  got engaged today however i'd be more impressed if the guy asked her when she was still over two bills  i guess she was a fatty yeah yeah she's doing those weight watcher commercials 
[00:13:30]  so uh but that's that's funny stuff yeah he's talking about muhammad pakistan and you know he just  gets into a little bit of everything but um very funny yeah he's calling quinn it was funny how he  talks about here he doesn't like cursing yeah yeah watch watch the blue language i don't think we  need potty talk yeah yeah we don't need potty talk but uh then i i got into a little uh war i just  like documenting things that are happening in my life and um i had some help some help over the house 
[00:14:00]  yesterday and uh i was just saying how i'm contributing um i said well here's me again  helping the downtrodden i wish i was in arizona i'd ask for his papers then call the ins and uh it's a  a hispanic a gentleman of some type of hispanic descent with a power washer power washing my basement 
[00:14:30]  stairwell just like mars yes yes of the spanish ilk absolutely although this gentleman seems to be  doing his job well yes look at him go sorry he didn't stop uh yeah he's he's he's power washing  my stairwell and uh i'm like i'm kind of proud of myself i'm employing people i'm part of the  solution yes you're not the problem yes but some people didn't like my tweet they thought i was  racist in what i said now uh i didn't understand why it was racist so i just kept coming back with 
[00:15:00]  um more racist uh comments than than that and some people get so upset there's that one i guess some  bitch that got after you about being a racist oh i don't know or believe about what what she is i  don't know if it's really a chick or i don't either well her bio says she's got like six kids  lives lives at home i i don't know what it is it's probably some just dumb guys yeah that's what i 
[00:15:30]  think but uh this idiot called me a a racist and um so then i i kind of fought back i said i am not  you fucking insert horrid race here and uh some people didn't like that other people asking me do  i hate black or brown people and i said only the bad ones does that answer your question winky face  see i try to be vague i try to be a little vague with my posts but some people don't get the joke yeah 
[00:16:00]  they're very um very sensitive well you handled it well here you went to hey uh you're a lib twat  with a hundred followers i'm a raging racist with the radio show i win haha we get our country back  that's good that's good okay maybe that wasn't as vague as it could have been yeah sounds like  somebody's been drinking and tweeting thinly veiled yeah i was a few beers deep of course during that 
[00:16:30]  exchange oh boy i'm a dangerous uh twitterer um and texter sometimes yeah uh if if i if i am  imbibing in some alcoholic beverages i might get a little loose with my texts which uh sometimes  could be a little dangerous i have to look at my phone sometimes and uh i look at my texts and i go  um what did i say to that person i look at the list of people because you know your iphone you got all 
[00:17:00]  your messages and uh you look at everybody so i just hit one and i go oh oh and then i don't want to  scroll back and look at the entire conversation because i don't want to actually see what i now  i texted sometimes it's kind of embarrassing you know it's going to be humiliating it's just going  to be embarrassing humiliating uh irrelevant stupid so i i tend not to look but um i guess i was pretty  good yeah yeah i was good with the texts but the tweets yeah i kind of got into a little 
[00:17:30]  a little battle yeah that that that that person with her or his whoever it really is  they're just attention or occasion and again whatever i mean i if i could get people's attention  who i liked or hated by doing that yeah yeah you'd do it too i don't know it's it's it's one of those  things though twitter isn't like a message board um some people were bashing me the other day  it was just like two people because i blocked a couple of people yeah and then other people that 
[00:18:00]  know that person get on me about blocking their their friend or something oh real brave man you  blocked it's like why wouldn't i block you yeah like i don't want to troll through tweets and look  and find something that just bashes me i mean yeah you could you could write it you could have your  you know few followers read it but i'm not gonna read it yeah i blocked some people too i love it 
[00:18:30]  because if someone disagrees with me that's one thing but if someone's just being a cunt exactly  if you you that's the equivalent of you're that's heckling right you're heckling if you're heckling me  at a club i'm not gonna go oh you're entitled to say i mean you are yeah get the fuck out this is  the get the fuck out of my twitter club yes i am yeah you're in club twitter yeah and you are being  you're making a ruckus and you're being ejected and if i think management if i think you're being  a purposeful jerk off i'm gonna i'm gonna make i'm gonna call it audible and fucking block you 
[00:19:00]  because people don't understand fans while you know obviously they're very necessary and they are  the reason kind of we do what we do i mean without fans you don't fucking have success yeah but but  sometimes they uh they want to have too much input into what you're doing yeah yeah and they start to  resent you and they've become too close to the show or too close to you and they're like you know  what the fuck yeah goodbye there is this resentment yeah what is it there is this just resentment they 
[00:19:30]  know everything about the show and that's why it's hard sometimes to attack them see this is what a lot  of you guys don't understand this is why blocking is the only thing it's the only way to really get  under your skin yeah yeah because you know me i use my real name you know my job you know all these  things yeah all i see on you is some fucking wacky twitter name some name not even a picture  yeah they just put a little fucking avatar thing on there and and that's all you know about the  person there's no way to know anything more about them like that look oh nice nice stock fucking 
[00:20:00]  picture so they don't want to present themselves they don't want to give any information about  themselves but they want the respect and the ability to speak out as somebody who has presented  themselves like they're in a room with you yes yeah like we're sitting down for a debate uh and  you've opened up your opening volley is just a blatant insult yeah well what am i gonna do sit  there and take that shit i'm gonna take a personal interest and seen you suffer yeah it's like instead 
[00:20:30]  of getting into a twitter war with someone who's got 13 followers yeah just block them that's what i do  and it annoys them it really does and you don't think of them ever again no ever i couldn't tell you  who i've blocked yeah it's probably about 10 people it's not like a lot but it's it's i mean  i probably blocked more than that yeah yeah people just they tend to be nasty sometimes they're just  nasty not a lot when you look at the amount of followers you have and the amount of people you've  blocked it's not that much no but it's uh it's a far cry from a message board where uh people have 
[00:21:00]  this power and ability to just you know bash the shit out of you and and the post stays there forever  and shit like that but i don't see a lot of people doing that these days going to message boards and  stuff they're they're not that they're not the message boards don't matter but it's kind of  evolved a bit like uh pal talk because again you can look at people it's people having real  conversations yeah you know they would show off for each other and whatever just look at the  chest tits it's more interactive yeah and twitter is much more immediate everybody wants because we all 
[00:21:30]  like to see who's read our posts i mean you know you're on message boards you want to know who's  responded who read it yeah well with twitter it's immediate you know you immediately know people  see what you say yeah yeah that's why it's uh that's why i block people i don't tweet that often  i just put pictures of mexicans working my house doing landscaping really busting apart those  stereotypes yeah this the girl you're talking about i don't necessarily believe is is uh who she 
[00:22:00]  is or says she is yeah i get you get you'll notice too you get contacted by people there are people  who are who again have this weird resentment but are somehow desperate for a relationship with you  as a performer yeah it's really bizarre is that i don't get it and the bad the bashing like and  whatever you don't like the show fine if i don't like something i would just not even get that  involved and invested in in bitching about it so much uh if it was just inconsequential to my life 
[00:22:30]  you know never and not that i wouldn't be critical because i'm very critical of a lot of things but  i've never gone to a message board of something that i either liked or didn't like yeah just just  to shit talk it it just i guess but then again i'm able to talk for a living so maybe i get out of  my system yeah you get it out of your system but you know unless something's affecting  me why am i going to get all impassioned about it just shut it off or you know don't listen don't 
[00:23:00]  watch don't whatever but uh some people just feel compelled to just bash the shit out of you  goodbye yeah and again people who bash you on the level of this is who i am and this is why i have a  lot more respect for because that's kind of the way it is in clubs too yeah where if somebody yells  at you you see what the person looks like you see their face yeah they're right there you can  address it yeah it's almost like if someone yells you suck well the first thing you got to do is  look at them all right well i know nothing about them i don't know what their job is i don't know  what they suck at so you have to immediately go after their appearance or the person they're with 
[00:23:30]  or their voice or what you have to address it somehow yeah because the whole audience is staring  at you but if it's just a voice it's like them pipe here's what would be guys who are douches on  twitter and using wacky names that you don't know what it is it's like somebody piping in a heckle  over a loud speaker yeah it's like speaker in the back of the club you're in the middle of your act  and somebody's like you suck and you're like where who said that where are you and it's just a speaker 
[00:24:00]  in the corner and you're supposed to address the speaker like i'm supposed to be me in front of  everybody addressing the speaker yeah hey you anonymous anonymous person unplug the speaker go fuck  yourself speaker you know i have a lot more fun when somebody's right in the room there  yeah absolutely i guess i've just been kind of all after 20 years of stand-up you kind of get used to  that yeah yeah i like what you brought up though about uh when you see somebody and and you're just  looking at them that when you get on them the first thing you're going to do is is what you see 
[00:24:30]  sure so it's usually going to be looks or what you're wearing or just some type of vicious attack  on their person because you don't know them or your voice like one thing you do when you're when  you're heckled is i've i learned this trick many years ago in a club that kind of had a bit of an  l shape to it somebody was yelling like yeah and i was just addressing them but the right half of the  room didn't hear it they didn't hear what they said so they just heard me kind of addressing a  heckle so you repeat what they say you get to hear their voice again you get to hear what they say 
[00:25:00]  and the more they talk the more likely they are to fuck up that's the rule so why do you what do you uh  you know you have to engage them a little bit because they will fuck up yeah yeah they're not  used to this they're not pros and if they're really good at it you can just fucking mock what alpha male  assholes they think they are there's always a way to smash their fucking teeth always but you have to  engage a little bit yeah yeah otherwise you're just going off one word and that's to me what what  twitter can be like or a message board and that's a lot of the message board guys get mad at me because  i've harped on well how come you don't use your name but it's like if you're going to smash me 
[00:25:30]  i'm not so above it all that i won't smash you back like i don't think that i'm so oh you're  just a little peasant you can't win with fans yeah hello sometimes hello did you say do you hear that  is that me danny button it's if somebody bashes me i'm not so above it where i don't bash back  yeah it's like if you bash back why do you care what i say or if you ignore it you're elitist it's  like you can't win with them yeah yeah oh what you don't want to address this look he won't talk 
[00:26:00]  about it and the second you do address it oh got nothing better to do yeah you can't win for losing  i say i've said that many times on first dates loudly good gosh uh i i i find it phony on tv and um  and movies and stuff when when people don't know each other they get in a confrontation and don't go for  the the jugular uh the um appearance uh i don't think um people of different races can get into an 
[00:26:30]  instant fight without throwing an epithet out to tell you the truth it's unless you think you're  going to get killed but um i don't see a genuine evenly matched fight happening on the street  without because you if you're getting to the point where you're gonna start throwing fists  fisticuffs uh you're you're gonna just say horrible things aren't you yeah if you can't  stand somebody or somebody cuts you off you'll look at the car that and this is absolutely what i do 
[00:27:00]  you'll look at the car you'll look at who's driving and you just either mumble under your breath or yell  it out or whatever the worst thing you know i don't know that person as a person right so i only know  them as what i see yeah so you blurt it out unless unless your argument is over unless the issue you're  arguing about or fighting with somebody about is so so much in itself stands as something to argue  about like if you're arguing over i pulled into this spot first racial stuff might fly but the the 
[00:27:30]  point of you fucking cock i'm here no you're not there's something to both focus on other than that  the racial stuff will probably eventually come out it probably would fucking you uptight white  motherfucker you spoke whatever it is it's gonna come out or you at least think it because you're  angry and those are angry words yeah you're at least thinking it i like i like when people say that  they go like i've never thought of uh a racial epithet in my life i've never you know it just doesn't 
[00:28:00]  come into my head like bullshit if you're wronged by a person of a certain race you're at least gonna  think it what at least gonna think especially if you don't know them when i argue with patrice or keith i  really don't think that stuff no no not at all because i just i i i know those guys right so i  have like a lot of stuff to get annoyed about or a lot of stuff to fucking yeah you know them well  enough to be annoyed my friends a hundred things before race comes into it i know patrice's  inconsistencies or what i'm ass he is or keith's fucking player so i look at them like you know any 
[00:28:30]  other friend it's like there's a million layers to fucking go into it that's not the issue but when  you don't know somebody you you don't have those layers to peel when you're fighting yeah or to get  angry about i just see parking space chinese yeah i think people are phony when they say they uh  have never thought it's it's a complete lie because and and it's it's not human people who don't think  there are people who i think don't think in racist terms like there are people oh i'll agree with that 
[00:29:00]  sure like my ex if i get cut off and say something racist she'd be like what do you and she really meant  that like if she got caught up by a black guy she wouldn't think you fucking that really just  wouldn't be her thing she'd be like what a prick yeah because her her upbringing was much different  and her family was different and you know the racial makeup of her family was different right so  she would it really wouldn't be her instinct she told me the time where she noticed it like where  i was rubbing off on her is when she performed in front of an all-black crowd because she was very uh 
[00:29:30]  very much liberal when it came to race and stuff and she i said you don't feel that when you're  ever on stage in front of a black crowd you don't feel that weird aggression sometimes and then the  next time she did it she was like yeah i did feel it like thanks asshole with this audience i felt  that there was something there from them you do feel it sometimes from the audience like you know i'm not  some they're not this great audience i'm just this creepy white guy they feel some type of an  animosity towards me sometimes wow you've you've felt that on stage oh without it i don't do ethnic 
[00:30:00]  shows not um black shows i won't do latin shows i won't do special i won't do gay shows any type of  specialty show i don't want to perform on because to me anybody that's in the room simply because of  i've never seen jim norton yes i was at the gay lebanese bear convention it was me and three others  so there is a feeling though you can't like absolutely tell when you're on stage but you  know in front of a black crowd they don't black crowds are weird like they're great audience they're 
[00:30:30]  like the italian crowds they're very very ethnic if they love you you're fucking golden man they're  great great audiences if they don't like you it's gonna be a long night it's gonna be rough yeah  but black crowds are weird they're like nicer they're a little more lenient with white comedians  than they are with black comics like there's a an illusion that if you show up in front of a black  crowd and they're just gonna be like hey fuck you it really isn't like that yeah unless you're maybe  in a really thug crowd most of them kind of like they know that you're walking into a lion's den in 
[00:31:00]  some way yeah they always give you a a moment more than they would give before they just rip you apart  if you suck yeah if you suck they're gonna let you know yeah you're getting killed but i've i've had  experiences where some of my stuff was going over some wasn't the sex stuff they go crazy for like  they love my sex stuff it goes very well like black crowds don't like stuff about god that much that's  really nasty they don't like any nasty religious stuff oh really no they don't like pedophile stuff  just not it's just not what uh black culture thinks is really funny you know well that is 
[00:31:30]  ah there's see there is such a difference between what you find funny what you don't it's just  culture but when you're killing in front of a black crowd and again i haven't done one in so long  but i mean it really is yeah but it's it's a weird feeling when black people don't like you too  you feel like god damn it yeah yeah why i wish i was kind of hoping you'd like me thought i was  gonna win you over like i was in i was doing pittsburgh i did the improv and in the back left  there was this one loud table and i couldn't see them you know guess why but it was a table a black 
[00:32:00]  table and they were kind of chatty and they weren't they weren't yelling at me they were just chatting  with each other yeah and i got annoyed like of course the fucking black people were talking  but you know again this this table but it's different like why is that different than a  table they weren't yelling at me they were just being rude yeah i get that all the time yeah yeah  with fucking white tables but immediately it's a black table i'm like ah fuck they don't like  because i'm white they're just yapping because they're black you know it's stupid pull a michael  richards on them no it wasn't that bad but it's amazing how you it's not like fuck them they're 
[00:32:30]  black i figured they were thinking fuck him he's white all right it's like a defensive reaction  because you think that they're looking at you yeah yeah am i making sense yeah totally i i i understand what  you're saying i just can't imagine being in that position well again i would just that that would  be all that would be going through my mind and i would not be able to function it depends on why  you think somebody's heckling or giving you a hard time or being rude if you feel because again man  you're perceptive up there you pick up things you're perceptive dude you know when someone's just kind 
[00:33:00]  of being an ass and you know when it's something else you can feel it man you can feel the energy  like when a guy is fucking you know who's tough these wall street guys who are so used to be in the  fucking funny guys in the room and the attention guys in the in the boardroom hey how you doing you  know the alpha male guy with a tie yeah and then when when they start heckling you you know what  they're doing they're trying to fuck you up because they're jealous that people are looking at you and  they don't like that there's way more to it than a guy just having fun we're gonna do that kind of  lean back in the chair look up at you like all right come on funny man yeah do your thing like that 
[00:33:30]  oh i will blow the whole set humiliating that guy fucking with that person lenny marcus who  you know lenny has worked with me many times he's a funny guy he's a you know lenny have you met  you he was in here one time with glasses he looks like really nerdy and like a victim i don't pay  attention to anyone that walks i don't blame you uh he's a jewish fellow you might have lost each  other on certain political ideologies okay while you are while you were fucking uh you know doing a  fucking mexican hat dance around the screen while fatherland was on he might have it happens but he's 
[00:34:00]  he's he looks like a victim but you know with the glasses and he's nebbishy and his little jewish  arms and you know but he's funny lenny's a funny comic but yeah lenny has really weird jewish arms  like he keeps his elbows by his ribs when he talks and he gestures with his fucking elbows out like a  praying mantis almost so it's like yeah yeah he's a really weird little w with his arms he wears two  t-shirts he's a fucking ass but he's funny man and he's a lot funnier than you think he's gonna be and 
[00:34:30]  he's more competent than you think he's gonna be because he's just this like he looks like you know  his opening joke is about how he looks like a computer tech and he does so he's on stage at  the cello one night and he brought in this female friend not a girlfriend just a chick and there was  a table and some guy had this awful hat on and he was trying to heckle lenny because he thought he  could get over on lenny and he's like yeah you're not funny and boy did lenny put down the comedy  character fuck you you fucking piece of shit this he humiliated that guy the whole room got 
[00:35:00]  uncomfortable with it and the guy immediately realized oh motherfucker i just put my dick in a  bear trap and it was so bad that when lenny walked off outside off the uh because the guy wasn't being  playful and i guess lenny picked up on that and just took the gloves off right and the guy really  embarrassed lenny in front of his friend friend because he wasn't trying to be a fun heckler he was  trying to really hurt him yeah so when lenny was at the he walked back into the cellar and lenny told  meet me outside you fucking cocksucker it was like one of those wow he was serious he shamed that guy 
[00:35:30]  the way that guy tried to fucking embarrass him he embarrassed that sometimes you gotta ruin the set  sometimes you gotta make your fucking point just to get it the one person that's fucking with you  because you're you're trying i'm not gonna be playful with you you're trying to embarrass me you're  trying to be a real prick so i was really so happy he did that i would think also that the the set is  going to be fucked anyway if this guy can continue yes unabated to fuck with you so you might as well 
[00:36:00]  throw the set away and pound the son of a bitch colin is so this is where colin is so great he's  like like nick nick is such a great comic but nick nick is psychopathic nick's fuse is fucking it's  hilariously short like he could be killing and he'll do a joke that should get grown dead that  fucking hillary clinton and dyke and then one person goes whoa ah you fucking nyu and he just  and nick is your hero a lot of times because you'll love the way he's just fucking straightening the 
[00:36:30]  audience out yeah whereas colin is so great at like not like if somebody is like if a joke doesn't  go over colin does it immediately attacking it defensive and he's amazing like you know well all right  folks well you know okay and he just looks like that's the way it's supposed to be going that  went well yeah you don't have to you know a lot of times he just brings them around but he never seems  to be fucking phased at what he's doing that's that's the thing with colin he's never seems to be  fucking uh frazzled is the word is that the word yeah yeah i i don't i i don't know how you even get 
[00:37:00]  to the point of what you do and uh colin and you know patrice because you obviously had to take  so much shit early on when you didn't know how to handle the situation and i wonder how many  actually talented comedians give up and just say fuck it and don't go on because they just got  they got fucked i've told the story before but my my worst heckling thing which the one that hurt 
[00:37:30]  me the most was like two nights of the night before desert storm broke out in 1990 i was like in the  business six months levy was the host of the show i talk about in the books i'm not gonna get through  the whole story but i looked up to bob levy back then i loved him i mean i still love bob but he  was the fucking funny local guy it was the big room at rascals i had only done the bar and bobby  went up and was murdering just killing and he brought me on and i went up and i had my purple baggy pants  and i bombed and i remember i actually broke character i didn't know how to hand i didn't 
[00:38:00]  know how to dig myself out and i was like am i too dirty no you started like asking i was like five  minutes like am i too dirty or something and some guy just went nah get a new act  get a new a new act and i just went i'm sorry i'm not gonna waste your time anymore and i walked  off in the middle of the set oh oh now after that how the fuck do you get back on a stage i walked 
[00:38:30]  off and that was humiliating i cried i cried driving home i really did no i cried what a great scene for  a movie oh my god i fucking cried driving because to me it's like it's a common when you first start  maybe i'm when you i don't know how it was when you first got into to doing uh radio but you always  think like this is not gonna last this is way too good to be true yeah yeah the bottom is gonna fall  out i'm gonna fucking die on the vine it's a pipe dream faggot and that was the confirmation like 
[00:39:00]  after six or eight months of having my old open mic success like yeah this kid's pretty good oh here's  jimmy norton this is what you are you fucking flop and i fucking bawled like a bitch all the way home  i was it was over the dream was over i was never gonna get back on stage and i called ward magnuson  who ran rascals and i don't know why i was like i don't know i just talked to him i apologize he's  like that happens apologize for your set for your act i was gonna get a new act and that's such an 
[00:39:30]  awful heckle oh it's like from vaudeville get a new act you're packing your props in your steamer trunk  oh i guess we need a new act exactly the chimpanzee died what are we gonna do chimpanzee  that's a chimpanzee with his friend maxine they do a show together chimpanzee chimpanzee  maybe that's why i bombed i couldn't say chimpanzee i should get a new act for the radio  a new act quick bring on the dancing girls and levy was very nice about it after levy was very cool 
[00:40:00]  because bob can be a caustic prick but he was very he was very sweet was he sympathetic yeah yeah  yeah he was a comic you know he knew it really hurt like you know he didn't even tease me like you  know bob is wow normally you'd fucking thank god it wasn't voss if that was voss as the host of that  show i i would be fucking i would be working in a hardware store to this day selling flooring  that rotten fucking twat fucking ripped you an ass don't fuck with me or i'll bring norton back  he cries oh i was awful but i talked to ward who ran the club and he goes uh well you know do some 
[00:40:30]  soul searching you know he was basically saying don't give up it's one of those things wow soul  searching yeah like because i was he's like to see if you should give up or not so i was like should i  quit and i uh didn't i kind of wanted to be talked out of quitting and he did effectively so the  next night i was like fuck it i'm gonna go back on tonight i gotta get it i gotta do it right now  but then the war broke out so all the shows were canceled that night so i went on like two days  later but it will i think it will never hurt that bad again even by it'll never be that humiliating 
[00:41:00]  again right right that's what it is humiliating i'll never be that helpless i've bombed worse than  that believe me when i was warming up for leno in september i went on at a place not the comedy  cell it was another small club and i was doing this it was the leno stuff was hard for me because it  was five tv clean minutes of one subject it was a themed thing they were trying to figure out what  that bit was going to be so it's not natural to go up and do five minutes on planes for me yeah and i  went on this one place and i was dying a death it was like there was a fan in the room this is back 
[00:41:30]  in september you were able to hear the ventilation i'm 20 years in and i could hear the fan oh no it was  shamed silence and the comics were watching uncomfortable and it wasn't but it wasn't  aggressive the crowd wasn't being dicks they were not talking i couldn't shit on them i was just  bombing and i was so shaken up by that i was like this is what oh yeah this is why everyone doesn't 
[00:42:00]  do this i remember now i thank god i had another seller set right after so i could go and fucking get  out of my system yeah because that was a bomb that was a bomb where i'm like wow that was an  uncomfortable one like i couldn't get out of it 20 years and i couldn't get out that's another  thing about that that business that's uh beyond me is is that yeah you can be 20 years in you're  good you know you're fucking you know you're working yeah and and then one night it could just not 
[00:42:30]  work that's fucked to me it is so i always wanted to do a documentary on on uh comedy on doing the  same stuff like well like seinfeld did one warming up and i guess he kind of showed it but to me it's  fascinating how something will work literally from one show to the next it will kill one show and bomb  the next yeah how does that work i mean different people but it's the same shit yeah same people  yeah you were telling me that story when you went into was it danger fields or something and then they 
[00:43:00]  just look and stare at you and then the same stuff kills down the road hills downtown it was it would  be for 20 minutes later it's like where were you people 20 minutes oh you fucks doesn't make sense  how does this group assemble well and that group up there are cunts doesn't make any sense i think  lenny bruce i don't know if it was lenny bruce might have said the comic audiences he said i think as  individuals they're idiots but as a group they're a genius i think that was a lenny quote about how they pick  up on stuff and if you're fucking scared or you're uncomfortable they feel it man the pack mentality 
[00:43:30]  they just kind of get it growl smell the fear on you see the sweat yeah that's why confidence is so  important we're faking it well enough yeah because not a lot of comics i know have a lot of confidence  you know people are up on stage they could look like they have confidence but then most most of you  guys are insecure little boys you can tell like david tell i know fairly well and i can if if i think  tell is nervous or uncomfortable oh got yourself a piccaninny see you went you got yourself a 
[00:44:00]  piccaninny you know when it's fucking you know he's i'm sure he was a few sheets to the wind as they  say funny bastard man but i can tell if he's uncomfortable or a little bit nervous because  i've seen him so many times yeah he has little tells um you know patrice like you can always tell  when guys you really know and i know the audience doesn't know they never see it when you see guys  enough times yeah you would know you can tell when they're a little bit jesus you know or kyle i can  tell if kyle's trying to do a good set like where it actually matters to him if he doesn't you know 
[00:44:30]  he's not just playing around and you know yeah yeah yeah because you know these guys david tell  looks like um i noticed uh if you watch that broadview security the one with the mother and daughter  playing in the backyard and then they lock the door and turn on the alarm and the guy that kicks the  door in he's wearing a hoodie he looks like david oh does he i don't remember it really does but of  course you know it's the the thug white guy busting into the um the white people's house yeah that's how 
[00:45:00]  it normally happens yes of course it does we um i guess we'll take a break yes and then uh i'll talk  a little bit about um dead red red dead red dead oh you play it red redemption dead red red dead  actually um danny sent me a clip that was very entertaining danny's an asshole and i'd love to  touch on george lopez oh yeah yeah that too yeah george oh i like him more now oh well yeah he's uh 
[00:45:30]  doing that tbs show and um apparently he has that extracurricular activities uh where is that story  yeah that's a good one i gotta give that a full read yeah it's a short one oh yeah yeah oh  oh no oh oh boy oh boy not good yeah that's funny all right we're back yeah we'll uh we'll take a  little break we'll we'll eat and uh we'll be right back the opiate anthony show is now is now back on the 
[00:46:00]  virus sirius xm  hi  there'll be an anthony show jimmy norton yes uh danny ross sitting at the fort thank you danny  can i address what danny was asking me in the break certainly because danny was like he was asking 
[00:46:30]  if i gamble and i'm like no i don't gamble and he said well what are you going to do when you're at  the brigade july 2nd and 3rd i said i'm going to perform dan i don't gamble you know i was sitting  here the entire time and i completely missed that conversation oh it was kind of it was kind of  understood we you really couldn't hear it it was just he and i making eye contact ah but i knew  that's what he was saying so it was an unspoken thing yes but you picked up on it that you will be  at the borgata july 2nd and 3rd yes for uh amazing shows let's hope so yeah of course of course 
[00:47:00]  already a lot of people talking about that one yeah yeah it's always easy to get people that when  you're just gambling and fucking debauchery yeah yeah people could i i i have a feeling it's going  to be one of those because i'm going and uh i think it's just going to be this contrived me sitting  there and going watch everyone black jack and they'll all oh look at him he's doing it he's doing his  thing and while i'm fucking raging yeah i'm pissed off i'm punching listeners square in the face if they 
[00:47:30]  laugh at me for losing believe me let's hope that none of the listeners see you and go  yeah oh yeah don't do that yes seven please  embarrassing especially if you go up to like the big boy tables yes how annoyed would everybody be  up there if there's just a crowd of fans being loud yeah because the uh the high stakes room  they don't really like the riffraff yeah i know it'll look like happy gilmore 
[00:48:00]  just stuff shirts with shenanigans going on they don't like it when you're there yeah exactly  yeah they don't bastards i have fun though fuck it um wow just reading uh some of the pal talk stuff  hi hi everybody any good stuff or is it all no are they being a bunch of negative no actually 
[00:48:30]  they're they're very nice but they're very nice hey fucking pal talk why don't you get something  from mac yeah i annoying they have that pal talk express i have that is that good no what's the  difference it sucks it's web page based and what's that mean it's not like a proprietary program  you know you gotta go to a website and look in and then the cameras don't work well and  it just sucks really does suck why would they just make one for mac i don't know what are they doing 
[00:49:00]  come on come on pal talk no one's buying pcs anymore no no really a lot of people are yeah but  uh danny was um very mean yesterday was very mean and rude to me did i not say hello to you in the  morning no no i gotta i gotta jokes it's jokes everybody can realize this up now are you making 
[00:49:30]  jokes are you uh well i get you know i i get i get my phone my little iphone vibrates and i look and i  see it's a text from danny so i look and and oh an attachment i love those a picture or something  and i click on it and it's a video oh like what is what is danny doing he's sending a sending me a  video yeah it's my cum shots yeah make my own compilations what's that from relations what's that  did you or are you is that from a movie no well on uh all the tube sites like if you want to like 
[00:50:00]  look up just like the busting shots if you type in cum palatians get it yeah get it oh it's like  you're calling palatians and telling them to come over here yes yes chip some gold palatians still  over there palatians don't know whether they're coming or going yes whether it's up or down or  something or what i said what's that chip nothing it's fine too busy thinking of my lines 
[00:50:30]  so um it seems danny was playing uh dead red red dead red dead redemption red dead i can't i i can  never remember what's first red or dead that game is beautiful by the way it really is stunning looks  really good stunning but uh danny wasted no time um finding me in the game and uh this was 
[00:51:00]  this is what i had to deal with hopefully you'll be able to hear it  why would the volume be loud on a knife  well hard to barely hear it yeah that's the iphone stupid iphone volume should be louder 
[00:51:30]  of course it should be come on steve jobs too busy fucking putting on giant turtlenecks  oh well danny found me yeah you're very you're very very early on in the game i don't know if i  mean uh as lazlo said yesterday you're one of the gunsmiths yeah in the game yeah and uh i don't  know because i haven't played too much of it so i don't know if you if you run multiple shops or not  but uh you're basically the first gunsmith that you run into in the game oh so i said wow there's 
[00:52:00]  my friend anthony and i promptly took out my shotgun and shot the back of his head off i'm laying on the  floor didn't you hit me with the gun first first i push you to the ground yeah and i'm laying on the  floor and i said something about not enough room back here for both of us and uh boy you know uh for  the people that like to compare this game to gta a lot it is a lot different uh and one in one of  those ways the fact that in red dead redemption everybody is armed oh right so whereas in gta if 
[00:52:30]  you're walking around the city and you just pull your gun on somebody everybody starts shitting and  running away and you know putting their hands up well red dead redemption is a little bit different  in the sense that if you you draw your gun and someone sees you draw pretty much they're taking  out their gun and shooting and starting to shoot at you pretty much wow because all i did was i took  out my gun and i was fine and then i bumped into you and kind of knocked you to the ground and that  was all it took for for me to start getting shot up that's why in the video i sent you i kind of 
[00:53:00]  i'm kind of like spazzing out a little bit i don't know what to do because i was not expecting to be  shot multiple times and the second that it took for you to hit the floor yeah and did you do the um  the uh target tagging no that i didn't i didn't try it i didn't play too much of the game um like in  game i guess because especially at the beginning there's so much storyline and cut scenes and stuff  yeah um i didn't i don't even think i got to that that particular like lesson you know how they kind  of guide you through the first few missions i didn't even think i got up to it yeah they do have  that formula where they kind of uh have a lot of cut scenes and show you how how the game works 
[00:53:30]  that's kind of a that's that's a talent in itself in game making is being able to show you how the  game works without just running through the training mission you look the curve and i think  that's why portal worked so great on so many levels because you know you had to apply lessons that you  learned uh from previous test chambers into the later test chambers yeah and then at the end you  kind of had to put everything together and it just it was a perfect formula so the whole game  was actually a training kind of mission uh for the for the end game portal was a great game it still 
[00:54:00]  really and you can get it for free people if you're listening out there yeah steam is offering a free  portal from now until i think you have four more days until the 24th you could download portal for  free i think mac or pc and there's going to be a new one coming out a new portal coming out i think  around halloween time portal 2 it's going to be a huge game a lot a lot of people complained how short  the original portal was and it was but uh the release that's coming out in october is going to  be a full a full portal game you're gonna you're gonna it'll be a full price game and you'll get 
[00:54:30]  your money's worth i hope they don't um i hope they don't cheese it up like i i sequel sequels are um  like half-life of course one of my one of my favorite games ever was the original half-life and um  they wound up dumbing down the sequels like i liked the puzzle solving i don't like games where  um you have to try to jump to a rock 20 000 times your plummet to your death and you got to you know 
[00:55:00]  do the same thing over and over again hate those but it was like a puzzle solving kind of thing the  puzzles were very complex it kept you in game it didn't take you out of the game because you were  solving a puzzle and took you out of the first person shooter part of it uh but they wound up  dumbing it down and made it just a straight run and shoot kind of game and those get boring as fuck 
[00:55:30]  you know they can yeah on the other side i mean i always hated games where there was just some really  intricate puzzle that was right in the middle of some like action game especially like the first  resident evils like you're getting chased by zombies and then you're in a room where you have to like  you know uh you know solve some some coded puzzle and it's just like i have zombies after me why do  i care why am i doing this why am i why am i doing a jigsaw puzzle in the dining room half-life the  original one had puzzles but they were part of the game like you had to the only way to get up another 
[00:56:00]  level of stairs well the stairs were gone was to take an elevator the elevator didn't work  so now you had to go downstairs and try to figure out how to turn the power on to make the elevator  work but it wasn't just flipping a switch there was like a box was blocking a circuit you had to break  the box to slap the circuit together and you still didn't get power so you had to follow the power lines  to where something was broken and fix it so those it kept you in game those games i love but then they 
[00:56:30]  just they took all that shit out and maybe made you throw a lever or something and uh then you were back  to just running and gunning which if you're into that there's so many games that you could just run  and gun but i kind of liked that whole thing where it was and it was a lot creepier there was a lot  more um surprise shit around corners i think they just designed the game a lot better than they did  with the sequels did you play the uh uh the sequels yeah i played them all yeah all of them um no cheat 
[00:57:00]  codes either by the way uh which was frustrating as fuck i think the original game probably took me two  months to finish and it was uh i think it cost me i think it was part of the price of my marriage  because i would uh i i think i've told this before i would come home and um uh the wife thought it was  romance night uh because i me and opie used to carpool so we'd pull up to the house and the candles were in 
[00:57:30]  the windows like there'd be candles lit in the house the door would be open a little so i'd see candles lit  and i'd be like all right she she and i believe me i i'll even take credit for being a prick about  this one because i know what's coming when i go in the house and it ain't me what's coming when you  get the house uh the the candles um she probably had cooked uh probably had a nice uh captain and coke  mixed up for me when i get home because this was afternoon drive so you know i was getting home at 
[00:58:00]  seven o'clock yeah well getting home about eight o'clock and uh i'd walk in the door and maybe  she'd have something a little sexy on and there it was you know the two the all the things that are  supposed to be the the good wife doing the the good job for her husband coming home from work and i  would walk in the door and look at everything and then quickly just dart my eyes over to the computer  at the desk and all i wanted to do was play half life i just wanted to get on and go through a few 
[00:58:30]  more levels so what would you do would you actually would you eat the nice dinner and would you would  you fuck or would you go would you walk in and start making excuses hey do i'm tired man my back hurts  or i i would i would sit down like in front of the tv with with dinner uh and and watch some tv drink a  little bit and um and then yeah try to like i'm i'm slowly going trying to blow candles out from 
[00:59:00]  across the room picking up the paper really let me read this yeah yeah yeah hope you can fans them  out picking up anything flat and waving it around the room just trying to take the romance out of the  room yeah uh yeah she she was she was trying and i was just telling horrible stories how was work  that child was killed on the l.i.e that was terrible you know so she was trying and all i wanted to do 
[00:59:30]  was you know get on that game blast away some head crabs with a shotgun and get up another get up  another level new call of duty's coming out too yeah yeah yeah yeah can't wait for that one  i was i was really um i was really bad with with video games for quite a while i've i've definitely  gotten better because i don't uh i can't sit there for hours on end i just don't find i is it i don't  know if it's me or the games themselves i i think i just kind of moved on but i can't sit there for as 
[01:00:00]  long as i used to with video games i would sit there and have a drink smoke the the room would be  full of smoke have an ashtray with a mountain of cigarette butts and just sit for it was probably 18  hours straight just playing games and then the wife would just be like you know at some point i'm 
[01:00:30]  going to bed all pissed and she'd go to bed and then i'd crawl into bed when the birds are tweeting  and the the sky's getting blue out i didn't even know birds had twitter back then oh no the sound  they make chip they make a tweeting sound thing is that's so that's so funny here's why you can't sit  in front of a computer all those hours because you're no longer in a long-term relationship  so you have moved on and now all you can do is stick your dick in different people  that takes up the video game time no but that's not the truth you're fucking 
[01:01:00]  your assembly line cock  pussy ass next pussy ass next pussy ass next  no  i just don't find them like like everquest was was huge too for me big big giant game when it first 
[01:01:30]  came out before they really made it easy um it was just i was on it constantly that was the game  where you're just like one more level one more level one more level and you look at the clock and  you're just like fucking five hours went by and you thought it was 10 minutes when you're playing  some of those games time can just fucking race by and i used to play pc games much more than like  yeah yeah console games oh well it was criminal they would call the criminal african-american or 
[01:02:00]  asian-american oh not politically correct uh games but you know what in jim's voice  i think it has a lot to do with the fact that you're just not sitting in front of a computer for  as long as you used to yeah like if you wanted to communicate with somebody online you used to have  to you know be at like you know where your computer was in the house that's true yeah and  now laptops are so affordable everybody has a laptop everybody has some kind of phone where they  could be in contact with people so you just you're not sitting there for the hours and hours like 
[01:02:30]  you like you used to be at least i know i was yeah you know back in the day with my first computer  but uh i think i mean i guess the other argument could be like well you know you could still game  on xbox but there's something that's just completely different about that sitting on a couch like eight  feet away from your your television uh as opposed to just being in your chair right up against your  monitor there's something completely different yeah and if you had a 17 inch crt monitor you were  golden uh but a lot of people are like 15 inch monitor and you'd sit there and play these games 
[01:03:00]  you know just with your with your face like fucking five inches from the screen and yeah now you you  know you're across the room it's a completely television wide screen it really is i i don't know it seems  more um more uh communal with the uh console games you were really kind of just by yourself in your own  little world with the pc games but uh when you when you're playing uh console games you're kind of out  there and anybody who's in the house can kind of look at what you're doing be annoyed that you're 
[01:03:30]  playing and not watching tv especially this generation of console games too because all of a  sudden you know your friend pops up on xbox live or whatever yeah yeah and you're like oh and then  it kind of takes you out you kind of go to your menu oh what's what's he playing oh maybe i'll play  with him and then you know who knows maybe you swap a game out or something but i gotta disable that  feature that tells all my friends what i'm doing on xbox yeah so should d-boy because i don't feel  like i don't need to know that when he's watching ernest goes to jail on netflix i got what he was  doing yeah one night sure he was watching ernest goes to jail i got ragged at um for watching 21 jump 
[01:04:00]  street it's like hey faggot get on call of duty what are you watching 21 jump street for and i'm like  oh yeah they know what i'm doing you need to alter your privacy which is freaky man that's fucked up  yeah when they know what you're watching you know i just wanted to see a young johnny depp  yeah that's understandable why wouldn't i yeah smooth and then quincy you know just pop up some 
[01:04:30]  episodes of quincy so people start texting me quincy jimsy lines i haven't seen a quincy episode in  such a long time it's so great they are just fun and that's the great thing about the new media  and mediums that we have for uh outlets for for watching tv and movies uh not everything's  available and sometimes i bitch about that movies you can't get on netflix instant uh shit like that  but tv shows there is shit that would just be gone in the fucking vapor of the cosmos never to be seen 
[01:05:00]  again and you could dredge these old shows up and watch them uh whenever you want just pop them on  it's an instant you know yeah like a quinn hey can you look for some uh any quincy episodes  moments on youtube where quincy is making a speech of some sort yeah also old movies too because  you know a lot of time i mean going to like the old school video store or whatever you'd look through  some movies and you never wanted to commit to some movie maybe like you heard of it you know but 
[01:05:30]  did you really want to spend the four and a half bucks to rent it yeah and now it's just you could  just you know hit play and it starts playing and then at 20 seconds in if you decide out fuck this  you just turn it off yeah you bail and there's no big deal that's uh yeah that's what it and that's  how it should be it's great though because then everything like you're saying you just get to  you get to discover new stuff that you just wouldn't have new stuff you wouldn't do or just  shit that like you remember from your youth and just kind of makes you laugh people's patience is  much less though because again like you said you can turn it off for 20 seconds yeah so people have 
[01:06:00]  much less tolerance i think for getting to know things it's like yeah no good turn it off  that's that's why shows don't get uh as much time yeah uh radio stations build an audience radio  stations yeah i mean years ago when uh but here in new york you had two four channel two right four  five seven eleven eight was connecticut and it came in kind of fuzzy uh nine eleven and educational 
[01:06:30]  you know pbs channel 13 that was it you would sit and watch a half hour show uh  and through commercials and everything that's all you did you sat and watch the fucking thing  now commercials pop on bump bump bump chicks are the worst too i don't want to sound like a hacky  fucking comedy act here but comedy act your act stinks get a new act get a new act but uh  commercials come on them bitches will grab a remote in a second yeah and i don't mind watching 
[01:07:00]  through commercials because sometimes i like commenting on them you know and fucking the  alarm one or that's stupid activity of fucking commercial by the way that would explain why  she grabs the remote she's every girl goes the commercial oh great here it goes he's gonna  complain about the white criminals again it's true he's gonna complain about jamie lee curtis and her  awful fucking shit all right jamie lee curtis we get it you're helping people take dumps 
[01:07:30]  activia take the activia challenge oh i was a little bloated but now and they do that little  hand thing where they make like they're whooshing in front of their belly with their hand uh to  signify that they have shit the commercial is telling you eat our yogurt and you will shit listen  to jamie lee she's done it it is great too i like to shit into a surgical mask this way it strains out  all the equity icky liquid equally which star is dead oh no quincy 
[01:08:00]  oh yeah a star is dead can we turn this up yeah let's listen to a little uh quincy he's walking in  a  horrible audio  find a new one that one's terrible that one's terrible but that guy was in everything that guy  with the glasses you remember him right yeah yeah there were people that just made the rounds

[01:09:00]  that but he's not a doctor he could be wrong no you're wrong he just said so you don't know if  there's any risk steve just don't play in this game i mean just in case i'm gonna play  if i didn't play i'd be letting him down worse than that i'd be saying to him hey hey you don't  care about me all you care about is that damn record that's why i kept your mouth shut you've  listened to me we're not saying that at all i don't want to hear it my father cares about me  my father my father does he loves me he always has and he always wills and i feel the same way  about him and i'm not going to do anything to let him down you understand me that's denunzio from 
[01:09:30]  caddyshack but it was great to quincy was having the impassioned speech quincy had the open  fucking big collared shirt and the jacket but why is he there talking to the child you're a coroner  why are you trying to straighten it wait till he's got a toe tag on him then fix him  exactly nosy fuck i'm sure he uh plays the game and uh it's horrible i'm sure something happens to  him i tried to save the child the record was more important oh no way to treat a flower tell you

[01:11:30]  money yeah you uh uh show their faces yeah and they're getting you know you know they're getting  paid for these uh stories stories so what is the george lopez hooker story is he a dirty boy no not at  all they're saying that you know just the text he wants to hook up with hot chicks and he they said  he had a big dick yeah and he wore condoms he was okay with the condom he's very normal sexually

[01:12:30]  up when you're supposed to show up and then to not uh open your your mouth or call or anything else  that's why you're paying them and they're going against the rules so annoying regularly was he cut  she didn't say he is whether or not he was clipped can't be i wonder if he's got a little peeny hole  in his foreskin like our own sam roberts old fucking stinky dick old water balloon cock 
[01:13:00]  goiter dick  squeezing it out like toothpaste yuck that whole image is disgusting well we have a piece of production  that we could play that i would love to hear it all right what is it well this is a production piece  that's entitled adventures in docking adventures in docking oh let's take a listen listen to this  welcome back everybody to adventures in docking now as we all know docking is when two gay men uh have 
[01:13:30]  their penises erect and one man takes the foreskin of his penis and stretches it over the head of the  other man's penis so let's go to the phones let's see we have sam here from new york um let's see  now sam uh when did this docking fetish begin for you well i was in college i was a freshman in college  so i came home for spring break uh-huh and i scheduled it to do it on the first day wow the 
[01:14:00]  very first day huh you sure are eager to try new things yeah so like what made you even want to get  into docking in the first place for whatever reason i wasn't circumcised obviously when i was born  okay so i see what you're saying basically you figured hey i have this extra skin on my penis  i might as well use it to my sexual advantage yeah uh now sam would you say that your penis is big  enough for proper docking like i don't know six inches uh i mean i don't know if i'm quite there  it's average now it says here that you once tried to dock with a very large black gentleman and it  didn't quite work out tell me about that the hole in the foreskin it wasn't big enough to stretch 
[01:14:30]  over over his giant cock head gotcha so it wasn't getting stuck to the head right it's not stuck to  the head it's just the hole is too small to fit over the head that is so embarrassing what did you  do about it going forward i don't want to have to have an explanation and so we went to the urologist  to get uh you know a word on it right so you wanted to get your foreskin stretched out so you  could dock with bigger men urologist said you know it happened it's not typical if you want to change 
[01:15:00]  it for aesthetics or for whatever reason it's a simple procedure and you come in and you do it  and you're out well that's great now you can dock with anybody yeah that's correct thanks for the  call uh this is all the time we have uh for adventures in docking this week join us next week  where we'll be discussing proper docking techniques at a pumping party see you then that's great oh  great oh you look stupid in that sam i yeah you came off looking stupid really queer in that i know  i didn't notice he looks really queer but i'm hosting a show called adventures in docking
