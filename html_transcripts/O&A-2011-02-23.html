<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie describing his son's christening, highlighting the unorthodox officiant, the presence of homeless individuals and a person with a large afro (later revealed to be a man) in the church, and a bizarre room behind the altar containing a Madonna photo and numerous maxi pads.  This led to a discussion about the difference between christening and baptism.  The conversation then transitioned to a scathing review of Scorch’s PFG TV show, characterized by its peculiar sponsor segments, odd production choices (including added crowd noise), a distinctive visual style (turtlenecks and blazers), and a generally bizarre aesthetic.  A segment of PFG TV featuring a bombing comedian was played and dissected, focusing on Scorch's obliviousness to the comedian's failure and his self-perception as a Johnny Carson-esque figure. Listener theories about the maxi pads from the church were also discussed.  The "Weird News" segment featured stories of a bank robber apprehended due to his driver's license found in his discarded mask, an 80-year-old convicted sex offender who donated to a baseball park, and a man caught burglarizing a business while watching pornography with his pants down. Studio guests Dylan Thompson (Children's Tumor Foundation) and Josh Kondelman (comedian) were present during this portion.


The critique of Scorch's show continued, focusing on insensitive comments made towards Dylan Thompson, a child with neurofibromatosis, during a segment featuring him.  Audio clips from the show were played to highlight Scorch's perceived ineptitude and bizarre behavior.  The hosts also recounted anecdotes about Scorch’s past radio work, including his claims of working off-the-books and his "Naked Militia" persona,  along with instances where Scorch falsely claimed the hosts were naked on air. Rich Voss then joined the studio.  The conversation shifted to Voss's science fiction convention experience, focusing on a humorous interaction with an actress and several off-color jokes. This was followed by further off-color humor, including sexually explicit discussions and anecdotes.  The hosts then brainstormed a new segment called "Deadliest Snatch," a contest where women compete for a prize by having the worst-smelling vagina.  They discussed logistics, potential prizes (over $2000), and strategies to attract contestants, including encouraging artificial enhancement of odor.  A female listener called in, enthusiastically supporting the segment and offering suggestions.


The "Deadliest Snatch" contest was further discussed, with the hosts brainstorming repulsive ingredients like stinky cheese, dog feces, and menstrual blood.  Pat Duffy, a former intern, called in confirming his fiancée (whom he met on the show) would participate.  The hosts discussed contest details, including providing clean panties and on-air descriptions of contestants' methods.  Another female caller, Sarah, expressed interest, stating she'd remove her pants but keep her top on.  Sexually suggestive banter ensued, including comments about her body and Facebook photos. Her participation was confirmed, and the contest was scheduled for a future date.  Rich Voss's experience with local radio versus Opie and Anthony was discussed, highlighting the differences in atmosphere and the hosts' tendency to verbally spar with guests.  Voss's upcoming comedy gigs, a potential golf outing at the Masters, and a subsequent phone call with a golf connection were also discussed, along with banter about their perceived celebrity status in potential golf pro-ams.  The segment concluded with further discussion about the contest and promotion of Voss's comedy appearances.  Vulgar language, sexually explicit jokes, and offensive comments were interspersed throughout the entire broadcast.


The show continued with a discussion of parenthood anxieties and frustrations with babysitters, including a story about re-hiring a previously upset babysitter.  The conversation expanded to anxieties about strangers and child predators, focusing on the perceived creepiness of male babysitters and men in roles involving children, extending to coaching and scouting.  Anecdotes about uncomfortable encounters with strangers who approached their children inappropriately were shared. The conversation shifted to airplane etiquette, bad drivers, and other irritating public behaviors. Roseanne Barr was mentioned as a potential guest. John Leguizamo and Fisher Stevens then appeared as in-studio guests.  The conversation initially continued the parenthood theme but quickly shifted to Leguizamo's Broadway show, *Ghetto Clown*, anecdotes from his career (including collaborations with Stevens and humorous incidents resulting in an Actors' Equity fine), family life, his relationship with his father, and the process of self-revelation in his work.  A caller recounted a story about an Air Force serviceman molesting children, and another listener shared similar experiences with suspicious individuals.  A brief discussion about the romanticization of Somali pirates also occurred.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a listener who claimed to have been briefly friends with Fisher Stevens in college and a humorous recollection of Stevens’s experiences with method acting.


The final segment featured a conversation with a guest, Rich, about his experiences with the documentary "The Cove," detailing production challenges, threats from the Yakuza, and mercury poisoning from consuming too much tuna.  The conversation included discussions of Rich's new documentary on female comedians ("Women Aren't Funny"), a past relationship with one of the hosts (possibly drug-fueled), anecdotes about Rich's personal life (multiple wives and an ex-wife babysitting for his current wife), and the hosts' and guest’s dietary habits (ranging from veganism to Kentucky Fried Chicken).  Rich's Broadway play, "Ghetto Clown," was heavily promoted.  Several movies were briefly discussed ("The Machinist," "The Fighter," "Social Network," "Winter's Bone," "Animal Kingdom").  Crude humor, sexually suggestive comments, and jokes about bodily functions marked a significant portion of the conversation. The segment concluded with further promotions for Rich's projects and the show's hosts, followed by a comedic promotional piece for a fictional musical artist, Tiffy Tom.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  Get a good one.  I brought in treats this morning.  You're doing me good.  You're doing me so good.  Give me a nice bite live on the show.  Oh, my God.  My sister could take on the cake boss, I'm telling you.  Not to step on Bobby's toes there, Sam. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, watch it.  But my sister is a fucking baker as well.  She knows what she's doing.  My mom doesn't make chocolate-covered Oreos.  My sister's got to, she's got to get a real website,  because she could take over Long Island with the baking.  I'm telling you.  How good is that?  Oh, my God.  It's heaven.  I don't even know what it is.  It's like an Oreo.  I know it's an Oreo cookie.  Then it's like dipped in like dark chocolate.  And then there's like a, there's a little, uh...  A little crucifix on the top.  A little crucifix on the top, because it was for my son's, uh, baptism.  Oh.  Baptism, right? 
[00:02:00]  Christening.  Christening.  When do they get baptized, or is that the same thing?  It's part of it, but the...  It's part of it?  Catholics christen and Baptists baptize.  Oh, okay.  How good is that, eh?  Oh, my God.  That was so good.  That was the favors at the old, uh, baptism.  And it looks...  Baptism?  Oops.  Christening.  Christening.  Christening.  Oh, my God.  And it looks perfect.  Like, it's symmetrical.  Like, there's no...  Yeah.  There's no, like...  It's not like she just dipped it in with her hand or something.  No, and then it's in a little plastic bag with a little blue ribbon representing the 
[00:02:30]  boy.  It's got...  And look...  It's got a little, uh, confetti in the bag to go along with the treat.  There's a little...  There's a little metal charm on the bag.  Yes.  I know.  It's a onesie that says baby on it.  That's right.  It made it impossible for me to get.  I had to breach the side of the bag.  You had to rip through it.  Yes, I couldn't take it.  Yeah, I didn't even talk about it, but my, uh, my, my son was christened on Sunday.  Wow, that's good.  In a church.  In a church.  In a church that, uh, like I'm on New York City, uh, like transplant, like I was, I was, 
[00:03:00]  I was telling people, I wish, I wish my kid got christened in maybe the church I used  to go to or the church my, uh, my wife used to go to, but just a weird church in the middle  of Manhattan that I have no real connection to.  And the guy could barely speak English in the front of the place.  And then he's like, he's shaking and he's got bad breath.  What the fuck is that about?  My whole family's listening now, but now you get to hear the real story.  I'm up there with my, uh, my kid with a bunch of other families and he's going through the 
[00:03:30]  pamphlet.  It's a christening.  There's supposed to be some connection with the, with the big guy.  Uh-huh.  I'm like, how is there a connection with the big guy if he doesn't even know what the  fuck he's doing in front of the church?  He's reading out of a God's pamphlet.  He's reading out of a pamphlet and he's like, oh no, not this.  And he's trying to figure out where to go next.  Yeah.  And then I'm, I'm just, just smelling his horrendous breath.  I don't know what he had before, before the christening.  And then he pulls out a bottle of water cause you got to christen the kid and get him all 
[00:04:00]  wet and getting, get him screaming.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he, he claims it's a, it's a bottle of water from the, the river Jordan.  And I guess that's supposed to be really special cause I guess not every christening gets that.  So they ship that over?  I think he might've been there and decided to get a few bottles.  I don't know.  It looked kind of dirty.  That's kind of cool though.  You know, is it for that kind of thing?  Cause they say it's the same river of where the Jesus got his christening. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I mean, that water is long gone.  Yeah.  That water has been, you know, it's been washed in and out a few times.  That's long gone.  It's not the same water.  Right.  So what does it, what does it matter?  If that really is, when he held up this bottle with this label on it, this kind of like religious  label on it, like the place went, Ooh, Oh, Oh, water from the river Jordan.  Oh, Oh, and I'm sitting there.  It's the same water.  No, no, it isn't.  I'm sitting there trying to make sense of this whole thing. 
[00:05:00]  Like, how is the, how is there a connection between this guy that maybe took a few classes?  Cause I didn't even think he was a priest and the Lord and the Lord, the Lord Jesus and  the Lord Jesus.  And then in the back of the church, this church is one of those rare churches where they let  the homeless in.  So now there's commotion in the back cause the homeless are trying to take naps and stuff.  Are you kidding me?  Not kidding.  This city is just weird.  And I, unfortunately I was too busy to pull out my flip or a camera, but there was, there 
[00:05:30]  was a lady in the back who had a, uh, Afro, uh, like, help me out like this big.  Like, like OJ and the naked gun in that scene where you had the big Afro.  Exactly.  I'm not even exaggerating.  You see how big I'm making this fake Afro on my head.  Giant.  It was that giant.  And then it turns out it was a dude, but everyone thought it was a girl.  And then people are talking that they think the dude is pulling tricks in the back of  the church while my son's getting christened. 
[00:06:00]  What the hell is going on in this church of Satan?  I can't wait to go back.  I don't want to do any of my funny business while I have my young son in the, my young  son in the church, but I'm going back cause it seems like there's some weird shit going  on in that church because the, the, the guy that's not the priest doesn't have a control  of the situation.  Do a little expose.  So I think, I think the homeless have decided they could take over this church and no one's  going to kick him out.  Does the archbishop know about this?  Does the Vatican?  I have no idea, man. 
[00:06:30]  All I know is like there were guys, you know, walking over to the Afro dude who we thought  was an Afro chick.  Yeah.  I mean, we didn't see anything going down, but there was some funny business going on.  They were in like the back row.  So they're in the back row.  There's plenty of rows between the christening and the, and the bums.  Lots of buffers.  A lot of, right.  So I'm going back cause I, there's something, there's something going on there, man.  Expose it.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Expose the church where, because if, if there are people having sex in a church, I think you 
[00:07:00]  should expose, you should be the one that goes in and exposes that and turns those people  in.  That's just, that's just wrong.  Abomination to Jesus.  Yeah.  We don't know.  Honestly, we don't know, but there was something very suspicious going on in the back of the  church.  I don't know.  Maybe there's a little, a little drug dealing.  Could be some dealing.  I don't know, but they were coming and going.  Prostitution.  But we all thought of his girl and somebody's kid, you know, we had, we had all the nephews 
[00:07:30]  and nieces there got a little too close and my brother goes, uh, uh, sorry about that  or whatever.  And, and she, we thought it was a she at the time goes, no problem.  No problem.  And that's when my brother's eyes got really big, like, holy shit, that's a dude.  Oh.  So, but anyway, the treats are from the, uh, the baptism.  I believe it was a christening.  The christening.  Yes, christening.  So I did some, uh, I did some godly stuff over the weekend, I guess.  Godly. 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, sounds like some was ungodly and some was godly.  I don't know.  Depending on where you were in the church.  But how is it that the guy reads from a pamphlet and then there's this, some, some spiritual  connection with the God?  Shouldn't he have that down?  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's what I said.  Especially if he's the guy that bringing water from the river Jordan, he should, he shouldn't  have to read off a pamphlet.  Don't you think he should have that memorized?  Memorize it.  Like he's done a million of these things and, and, and maybe he's got like, if you're reading  out of a pamphlet, how is that connected to the God thing? 
[00:08:30]  Well, for christenings, weddings and funerals, they should have all that shit down.  Right.  Because they've done enough.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Uh, confessions.  Well, it's different, you know, it's all different every time.  And then I go, can I go to the bathroom?  He goes, yeah, the door behind the, uh, the altar there.  I'm like, really?  All right.  So I'm in the back of the, no, just piss on the door, like the homeless guys do.  But they don't have, I don't know if they have public bathrooms or they, or maybe the  homeless took that over already.  So they gave up, they gave up that area.  So now I'm in the back of the church right behind the altar and, and, and in the back,  I swear to you, there's a newspaper clipping of Madonna and her young daughter on a bulletin 
[00:09:00]  board.  I don't know what the connection is to the church.  Oh man.  And then I saw a 40 pack of maxi pads, swear to you, wait a minute.  And I could have taken that picture and I should have, because I have no proof of this.  What is going on?  I don't know.  Like this is that for the homeless women.  You think?  I have no idea.  It's like, I need me a massive pad.  It was just a messy room right behind the altar.  You take the door to the left and you, you kind of go down this like very thin hallway 
[00:09:30]  that hallway that kind of, you know, wraps around the altar.  And of course I'm going to explore.  I take my leak and then I'm like, I'm, I have to explore a little.  So I go a little further and it's a really messy room that they barely use, obviously.  But the bulletin board had a picture of Madonna, her daughter, and then in like a bin or something,  there was a, I don't know if it was a 40 pack, but it was a big, huge fucking pack of  maxi pads.  Maybe this guy really doesn't know about the religion and he was told by his boss to put  up a picture of the Madonna and he's like, oh, I got you. 
[00:10:00]  No problem.  I'll do one better.  I'll put it in her and her daughter.  Yeah.  Oh.  And then what kind of disease is my kid going to get?  Cause he got the, the, the water from the Jordan water from the river Jordan.  Did they put it through some water filters?  Cause this is maybe the homeless guy's name was Jordan.  That would really be bad if it was water.  That's the picture or something similar to the one Danny just found.  Yeah.  That was in the, in the paper, uh, I don't know, a year or so ago.  And they just had it on the bulletin board and I like, who checked this water? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Are you sure this was a real church?  Cause this is a church actually was beautiful.  I'm like, damn, they spent some money on this church instead of, you know, taking care  of the, the needy.  Wow.  Cause that's what, uh, religions, uh, like to do.  She's just looking fantastic.  That little Lord is.  Yeah.  I think she's only like 13 in that picture.  Yeah.  She's getting, uh, but I can't argue with you because she dresses like she's a lot older.  So what are you supposed to do?  And a really nice hair.  You can just tell she's going to, uh, she's going to be a good one.  Blossom.  Well, she's got the Latino in her. 
[00:11:00]  So her, uh, and the Madonna, the slut, she got the slutty Madonna, young Madonna in her.  Yeah.  Her, uh, her father was at Sirius XM the other day.  Oh yeah.  People interview him.  I don't know why.  Cause I don't really know what he does.  I think he's a trainer still or something.  Getting tall too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got those nice dark features, right?  Yeah.  Cause Madonna is not a, not a good looking broad.  She's, she's figured out how to make herself a good looking over the years.  Yeah.  But all you have to do is take one look at her sisters and realize, oh, okay.  You're supposed to look like that. 
[00:11:30]  If you weren't a multimillionaire.  She's, I bet.  Oh my God.  Could you only imagine?  She must've grown a giant bush at like nine with Madonna's hair.  Oh, the kid.  And the Latina in her.  Well, she had a mustache by the time she was 11.  Oh, and the fucking eyebrows that met in the middle.  At least she's waxing that shit down.  Forget about it.  That must've just been giant.  You think the water from the river Jordan's all right?  I don't know.  I hope he ran it through a filter.  Yeah.  He got all his shots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's all right. 
[00:12:00]  But you know, they're crapping in the river Jordan, aren't they?  I don't know.  Having sex in the river Jordan?  There's shenanigans going on over there.  It's not as sacred as, as, as the Catholics like to think.  It's not like the river they pull that water for the Coors beer out of.  Right.  That looks nice.  Oh, that nice.  Sparkling and cold.  Nice cold fucking.  Rocky Mountains.  He's not tapping the Rockies.  No, he's not tapping the Rockies.  The river Jordan's pretty filthy.  But you couldn't put it through a filter, because that would get all the Jesus off of  it, too.  There's no Jesus filter.  There is.  Yeah, the filter would wipe all the Jesus. 
[00:12:30]  The Jesus, does it?  Of course it does.  And then you just throw the Lord away in that filter?  Exactly.  The Britain thing.  I'm not a huge fan of the organized religion, but I figured, you know, at least, you know,  put my son on the path and then let him decide.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just in case there is something.  I don't want, I don't want the guilt of going, ah, come on.  And then there happens to be something and he never went, he never went down the path.  You've got to do the prelims of the things that he can't do yet, because he's just too  young to decide on his own. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  So you do the preliminaries, and then when they get old enough, they want to keep pursuing  it, or if they want to change to something else, they'll just say, fuck everything.  I'm not saying that.  That's one thing, yeah.  I'm not sure what I believe, but I know the organized religion is a little messed up.  I think they have caused a few problems over the years.  That's where I'm at right now, but.  Was the water, like, brown or milky?  It wasn't good.  Did it have dirt in it?  It wasn't good.  Sand?  It wasn't good.  No.  It wasn't, like, obviously brown, but you could tell it was a little dirty.  And then my son is a bit on the older side for a baptism? 
[00:13:30]  Christening?  Christening.  Ah, christening.  And a little old, because I think you're supposed to do it when they're, you know, they're freshly  baked.  My kid's pushing one years old, but it made it a lot easier, because my kid wasn't the  one screaming and crying, like the one that was up there ruining it for everybody.  Were you the only white baby?  Um.  Were there other white babies there?  Or was it just all pretty much Hispanic?  No, there was a Hispanic.  A melting pot?  It was a melting pot.  A little Asian kid? 
[00:14:00]  No, not a little Asian kid.  That's what I'm getting at.  Oh.  A 10-year-old Asian kid.  Wait, what?  Where the father, maybe not 10, but they're going to hog all the water.  Maybe not 10, but eight with a full head of fucking hair, because you've got to get the  head wet, right?  Yeah.  The father is struggling, because you know you have to dip the...  He's got to hold an eight-year-old up and dip his head in?  Over the thing.  Yeah.  And then the priest spills the dirty water from the water.  He's struggling.  He's going to drop his eight-year-old, because his eight-year-old weighs about 80 pounds, 
[00:14:30]  it looks like.  Holy mother of God.  What were they thinking?  I don't know.  That was a little weird, because I think you either get christened around, I don't know,  before you're one, let's say, or 30.  Boy, they needed something really quick.  Oh, you think?  Yeah, something was going on, like, christen this kid, do it now.  I don't even want to know.  I don't know.  So enjoy the cookie from my sister.  Yeah, that was fantastic. 
[00:15:00]  Who certainly could take on the cake boss, and possibly Bobby.  I don't want to.  With her baking skills.  Don't start making challenges.  And I wish I could give an email or something, because people probably need baked goods.  I'm telling you, she's the best.  She's fucking.  How good was that?  That was fucking fantastic, to the point where I would eat six of those.  All right, there's more than that.  No, no, no, I'm not going to, but I absolutely could just sit here, and the sixth one would  be just as good as the first.  Well, the next time you have a teen party, I'm sure she could put together some kind of nice 
[00:15:30]  teen favor.  They're called favors.  A sleepover.  Yeah, maybe a little pajama cookies or something.  Yeah, because I got all the ingredients for, like, s'mores.  Yeah?  I got, like, the graham crackers and chocolate and marshmallows, and, you know, you can make  them in the fireplace.  Nice.  And, ooh, those are delicious.  How good are s'mores?  Oh, they're great.  Holy shit, I want some now.  Yeah, they're fantastic.  Who would win a little pajama parties?  Who would win baking battle between your sister and Mars' wife?  Oh.  Oh, I would kick Mars, uh, my sister would kick Mars' wife, wife's ass. 
[00:16:00]  No problem.  Destroy?  Yeah, destroy her.  Annihilate?  She would have a tough time with Bobby.  She would kick Martha Stewart's ass easy.  And also the cake bosses.  Wow.  Because the cake bosses, uh, I've had some of his stuff.  It doesn't taste too good.  It looks great.  It doesn't taste too good.  My sister knows how to make it look good, but also taste good.  It's all pizzazz.  Yeah, because they use that.  Ah, no substance.  It's all sizzle.  They use that fake shit.  What is it, Mars?  Fondant.  What?  Fondant.  Fondant.  Fondant sucks a dick. 
[00:16:30]  It's horrible.  But it's supposed to be, uh, edible.  Really?  Well, that's what they use to make it really look nice.  You know what I mean?  Right.  It's like Play-Doh with sugar.  Yeah.  All right, enough of that, so.  Stupid Islanders lost last night to the fucking Toronto Maple Leafs.  I'm not paying attention, though.  I'm just.  Anyway, uh, PFG TV in.  PFG TV.  Holy shit.  Me and I went old school, and we were texting back and forth all night long. 
[00:17:00]  It was fantastic.  It really was.  Someone tweeted me, man.  I read every fucking tweet, and I appreciate the tweets, and I can't get back to everyone,  but you guys are turning me on to some good shit.  Guy tweets me and goes, dude, the latest, um, uh, version of PFG TV from our old friend  Scorch that we used to work with many, many, many fucking years ago.  Scorch.  Up there at AF.  He was pizza.  You were hamburgers.  Yeah, but now we're starting to understand that maybe, even though we don't like Dave  Douglas, that Dave might have been on to something. 
[00:17:30]  I don't think it was.  I think officially we're going, you know what?  He was on to something.  I actually texted last night.  I said, this isn't pizza or a hamburger.  This is a giant shit sandwich.  Oh.  It was just so bad.  But he's like three seasons deep, dude.  Ah.  Someone's got why the maxi pads in the back of the church.  No.  In the back room of the church.  I was trying to figure it out myself.  I kind of was thinking this, and I didn't want to go there, but if someone else says it,  then I'll be fine with this. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yes, Danny.  Go ahead.  I hope I don't ruin this guy's joke.  No, I didn't see this.  Is it just in case the Virgin Mary starts bleeding?  Oh, hey.  That's a good one, too.  That is good.  Joe the Trucker.  A little stigmata.  It's a little more obvious than that.  Joe, go ahead.  My guess is that they had maxi pads in the back of the church for the young altar boys' buckles.  Oh, you think the altar boys are wearing them?  I don't think it's any worse than that.  After some type of horrid abuses have gone on? 
[00:18:30]  No.  Yeah, this almost priest, I'll call him, he didn't look like he had it in him.  No, huh?  Nah.  Were they maxi pads or tampons?  No, they were maxi pads.  Maxi pads.  Yeah, they were maxi pads.  If they were tampons, I guess you could just use them as a palm plug, right?  Yeah, yeah, if you're stigmata.  That's what I'm saying.  You could just plug up your feet and your hands.  And you're all set.  You're getting stigmata.  I just felt like I couldn't take out my camera.  I was off the clock.  But now I'm going back into that church, man. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, you got to.  And I'm going to explore.  You got to.  Because this guy obviously doesn't have control of this place.  Yeah.  The zombies slash bums have taken over.  They really have taken over.  And there's some creepy hallways and staircases that go downstairs, obviously.  I meant to say down to a basement area.  You can only imagine what's down there.  Oh.  And the church is like 300 years old, so.  I was going to ask, is it an old, old church?  It's one of those creepy old churches?  I'm going to go explore.  Yeah, wow.  Yeah, this guy don't care. 
[00:19:30]  That's probably, you'll find some like Indiana Jones shit in there.  Imagine.  Like a fucking secret wall.  Imagine.  Bugs and skeletons with their mouths open.  Imagine.  Yeah.  So PFG TV, yeah.  This guy tweets me and says that Scorch had this comedian on that bombed horribly.  Wait, which one was the comedian?  Because, wow.  And he goes, it's 36 minutes into his latest PFG TV.  I go, why fast forward 36 minutes when you can watch the entire show? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, why would you sift through gold to get to just another gold nugget?  I mean, Scorch is the only show where you don't even fast forward through the commercials  because they're Scorch sponsor breaks.  Oh, that's what he calls them.  Thank you.  We're trying to remember.  Sponsor break and the camera goes in and out.  Right.  And he's like, whoa, it's Sponsor break.  It's like Wayne's World in 2011.  Yeah.  Great.  For the people that I don't know, me and Ant, like I said, we worked with Scorch for maybe,  I don't even know, less than a year at AF. 
[00:20:30]  That's all it was?  He's an old school rock DJ and now he's got like this TV show, sort of.  I think he pays for the TV show.  That's correct.  He buys time like an infomercial.  That's correct.  On a local channel.  One of the My Networks in New Hampshire.  Right.  And then I guess he goes into some studio that is supplied.  It's got to be some kind of local access studio in town.  Yeah, local access studio because there are TV screens and stuff.  Yeah, the place looks great.  And he has facilities, I guess, for editing and things like that. 
[00:21:00]  And his look is bizarre because I was telling Ant, he's a guy that doesn't have to be bald  but decides, I look better bald.  Yeah.  And then, so he's completely bald, shaved right down the skin, and then grows that weird beard  where the beard just starts.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, the sideburns.  It's not attached to anything.  It goes from sideburns to beard and then just stops at the top of the sideburns because  he shaves his head.  And if that's not good enough, then he's decided he wants to bring back the turtleneck. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He loves turtlenecks and sweaters.  He wants to bring it back for the young people.  Yeah.  Because we learned the old people, like Tom Brokaw had one on the other day on TV, and Ant  said it.  It's to cover up the fucking turkey neck.  The gobble, gobble neck.  I didn't know that.  That's why the older guys wear the turtlenecks.  He's sporting a fucking crazy Eddie look because he's got the turtleneck.  But then he wears this blazer over it, and it's a bizarre look.  You ask him, though, and there is nobody who dresses as well as he does, if you ask 
[00:22:00]  him.  Now, I didn't look close enough.  Would there have been dog hair?  Certainly.  And dog urine smell all over those clothes?  It wasn't smell-o-vision.  I think that was the rumor back at the old station.  One of these days, because we own this channel here, we have to play audio of an entire show.  Because we were going back and forth, like Mystery Science Theater there, just fucking 
[00:22:30]  laughing our asses off and texting each other.  Because it's hard to explain, because it's nothing over-the-top funny.  But when you understand Scorch's mindset, it makes it one of the funniest things you could  watch.  It sounds like a good 10 o'clock hour activity at some point.  Oh, my God, yeah.  He thought for sure that he was Johnny Carson.  Right, yeah.  And thinks.  Reincarnated.  Thinks.  Yeah.  Well, I told Dan, he has the confidence of Mick Jagger with none of the skills whatsoever. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing to back it up.  He is a confident man.  But he knows how to broadcast, so he's not stumbling around.  He actually knows what he's doing.  He knows how to put a TV show together or a radio show together, but there's no substance  to it.  But he's presenting nothing.  Right.  And most of the things was him plugging stuff.  That was going to happen on his show.  That was going to happen and doing live reads.  Instead of doing it.  Right.  It took 12 minutes to actually do something on his own TV show, because he was too busy  promoting what he was going to do.  Yeah.  And then he did the, what is it called again? 
[00:23:30]  The Scorch Sponsored?  Scorch Sponsor Break.  Scorch Sponsor Break.  Where he talks about his unbelievable sponsors for 10 minutes.  One of his unbelievable sponsors, I was telling Anthony, and he was bragging about it, is a  company that takes your old shitty laptop.  Oh, God, yeah.  Puts it back together and then sells it for 99 bucks.  And then he's bragging that he's got one of these laptops.  And I told him, this laptop looks like it's from, like, 1998.  There's no reason to brag about it.  I love reading on my monochrome screen. 
[00:24:00]  And then he's doing commercials for eating, a place to eat, restaurants and whatnot.  And what was another one he did?  Well, he did the bar.  Oh, the photo place.  Oh, the photo place.  He's bragging about this sponsor that's a photo place and bragging how this woman that  owns the place takes pictures with a cell phone and they look great.  So the photo place doesn't even have, like, actual cameras.  It looks great. 
[00:24:30]  She takes it with the cell phone.  It looks fantastic.  It looks just amazing.  That's why you have to go there.  It looks amazing.  It's like, what are you talking about?  I'm going to be locked in my dog cage for the pause.  Right.  What is it?  Pause for the cause.  Pause for the cause.  Boy, does he love to rhyme things.  He does.  He loves rhyming things.  He's all about branding.  He was rhyming.  Which goes back.  I got to see what he was rhyming.  He knows how to put shit together.  Yeah.  And then he's, what was the other fucking thing I wanted to say? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, and then he's talking about his pub crawl.  He wanted to promote his pub crawl.  Oh, yeah, the pub crawl.  And then he wanted to show all the places they're doing the pub crawl.  It was two bars.  Did anyone else pick up on that?  The pub crawl.  Two fucking bars for a pub crawl.  Two bars for the pub crawl.  I got, what was he, what was he, he rhymed something and it was so.  You might have rhymed on that.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Let me see.  I'm looking for it because it was a typical.  Oh, God.  Let's see.  Oh, my God.  It looked like Joey Butta Fuqua. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, Scorch rhymes everything.  Did we ever, oh, oh, okay.  Inflation disintegration?  Yeah.  Inflation, they practice inflation disintegration.  Right, right, right.  Inflation disintegration.  And then he has a, he has a comic on, and that's why we're playing this today.  And the comic, you know, I know the guy's trying, and, you know, he's probably doing  well locally.  I don't know.  I can't imagine that he is.  I'm sorry.  But the fact is, he had a horrendous set, and Scorch is laughing in the background. 
[00:26:00]  And then Scorch now believes he's Johnny Carson, and now has to invite the guy back  to the couch to have a little chat.  Well, that's only because he liked him.  Yeah, that was Scorch's way to show approval, like, yeah, I'm going to bring him to the couch.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, it was Scorch's way of just filling up more time.  Oh, no.  He's already done.  Anybody would have, he would have pulled over anyone on the couch.  Yeah.  But Johnny used to do that, like, sometimes a comic, you would just wave, thank you, thank  you, and they'd go behind the curtain, and they were gone. 
[00:26:30]  And sometimes they were so funny, and Johnny was laughing so hard, he'd be like, yeah, why  don't you come over here and take a seat, and people would be, that was the, oh, my God,  he just made another star.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Johnny Carson just created another star.  Right.  In that split second.  Scorch was thinking that's what he was doing.  Yeah.  He actually said, why don't you sit down and relax?  Yeah.  Like, sit down and relax here on the couch.  And I want to know where he gets the crowd from.  And I brought it up last night that he pumps up. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, the beginning.  He adds, he adds, adds sound to the crowd.  Sound effects.  He puts, like, crowd sound effects at the beginning of his show.  To make it look like, holy shit.  I said it was like fucking 1977, The Who, coming out for an encore.  Yeah.  But then throughout the show, you can tell there's not nearly.  Yeah, because, like, throughout the show, when he gets a little applaud break, it's just  kind of.  And the crowd sounds like they don't want to be there.  Well, he gives free pizza.  Is that it?  If you go to his TV show.  I told Ann, it sounds like they're either being held hostage or it's like, I don't even 
[00:27:30]  know if he is into this stuff, but it sounds like maybe it's his drug dealers or something.  Like, they don't want to be there.  I love it.  Like, where does he get his crowd from?  Well.  Are they sort of friends?  I love that.  They didn't need the visual picture of Scorch's nippies.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, of course, show of hands.  Did anybody on TV see that?  Trust me, the hands were up.  Although they say that now.  But you know what? 
[00:28:00]  They're going to be emailing me later on saying, Scorch, you got those pictures of those nips?  We want to see them.  Anyhow, you all know Nick Carpinelli, right?  Give it up for Nick, the man on the couch.  The man on the couch.  That's Nick Carpinelli.  He is flying.  You know?  It's supposed to be, okay, yesterday was like 50 degrees.  It was nice.  It was beautiful out there.  Today, it was freezing.  Tomorrow's supposed to be 50 again.  Yeah.  And then through the rest of the week, it's supposed to be above average temperatures,  so we're going to have a lot of melting, and I'm kind of concerned about those in  the low-lying areas.  Oh, nice. 
[00:28:30]  Because there's a lot of low-lying areas.  There are a ton of low-lying areas.  Plus, a lot of our listeners, during the week, they live in gutters.  You know?  Nice one, Scorch.  That's what I'm talking about.  I don't want the others to watch the way.  Make sure if you're living in a gutter, cover yourself up nicely, because you don't want  to get wet and catch pneumonia.  You know what I mean?  Bad enough we're all going to be sick next week.  Yeah.  We'll probably be out sick.  We'll have Nick hosting the show again.  His computer's now covered with swabs.  Anyhow, what a show today.  I'm really psyched to have Dylan back on the show.  Dylan is...  Dylan Thompson's here. 
[00:29:00]  He's from the Children's Tumor Foundation.  And he is...  You can't intro a cancer kid by saying, I'm really psyched that Dylan's back.  That he's back.  He's not dead yet.  I'm really excited about it.  You saved that for a comic or someone with some kind of special skill.  I'm really excited.  That's his credit.  We're really excited to have Dylan here.  He has cancer.  Yeah.  Sorry, Danny.  Could you go back slightly?  Listen to how he talks about the cancer kid. 
[00:29:30]  Really excited.  Could be the worst thing for a foundation ever.  Because there's a lot of low-lying areas.  There are a ton of low-lying areas.  Plus a lot of our listeners during the week, they live in gutters.  So, you know, just make sure if you're living in gutters, cover yourself up nicely.  Because you don't want to get wet and catch pneumonia.  You know what I mean?  Bad enough, we're all going to be sick next week.  Oh, yeah, you did.  You never know.  It's a place in the show again.  But I'll give you plenty of notice next week.  Anyhow, what a show today. 
[00:30:00]  I'm really psyched to have Dylan back on the show.  Dylan is...  Dylan Thompson's here.  He's from the Children's Tumor Foundation.  Children's Tumor Foundation.  I'm hoping I'll get this right.  Neurofibromytosis or something.  Neurofibro...  Is that it?  Neurofibromytosis?  Yeah.  Wow!  He's laughing.  They're applauding, Dr. Ray.  He's making cancer fun.  My mother always did, so that's why she married one.  I don't get that.  Anyhow, let me talk to Dylan. 
[00:30:30]  This is on his second trip on.  And I'm looking forward to speaking to him.  Really cool young kid.  And he's actually sharp as a tack.  Last time we had a foot-smelling contest on the set, so I don't know what's going to happen  this time, but I'm going to leave it up to him.  I don't know.  He's a really smart kid.  He can smell feet.  The winner of the Laugh Ride, the Comedy Fest, it's Josh Kondelman, is here today as well.  Give it up for Josh.  I hate to see the losers.  We're going to talk again about winning his comedy things. 
[00:31:00]  Also today, we have got the Scorch's PFG TV CD Review.  We're going to be doing the Press Fist CD.  Danny, can you pause that?  The CD review, me and I were talking about this, too.  He picks a CD, and he describes the track for two minutes, and then plays 30 seconds of  the track.  Yeah, that's it.  And then that's not good enough.  Then he has to do it again for another track.  Right.  Do you think...  It's like, it starts off with a great instrumental, and it sounds kind of like tools for a little 
[00:31:30]  It gets a little tool-ish.  And makes sure you listen to the lyrics.  Do you think he's not getting these local bands to pay him to do that?  Oh, boy.  He is looking around every corner.  Who knows me?  I don't know for a fact, but it does fit...  Who knows what he's putting in his back pocket?  It does fit Scorch's MO to collect money and not to tell people about it who worked for  him.  I mean, his co-host slash sidekick was so pissed that he left Syracuse.  So pissed.  He just took off on it, right? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  For three months, he was like, don't worry, Pauly.  I'm sending out our tapes.  Don't send out any tapes.  Don't send out any tapes now.  I got this well in hand.  And then Pauly would go to the bathroom and be like, Simmy, don't tell Pauly, but I'm  going to be up in New Hampshire in three months.  Why would he not let Pauly try to get some...  No, no, no.  The day before Scorch's last show, I got a call from Pauly and I knew the next day was  his last show, but Pauly didn't.  And I was like, hello?  And he goes, Sam? 
[00:32:30]  I go, yeah.  And he's like, come on, we're going out drinking.  Oh, shit.  Because he had just found out it was Scorch's last show.  Scorch's last show.  And he had just not told Pauly.  You're not along for the ride.  Scorch's got to go solo.  But you're a shitty friend.  You're not going to go drinking with a guy that just got fired.  Well, I mean...  Well, that's the thing you're supposed to do.  What did you drink when poor Pauly there was drowning his sorrows?  Well, I mean, I would have Coca-Cola's until the calorie count got a little high.  Then you switched to Seltzer. 
[00:33:00]  Great.  While he's like, fuck Scorch, man.  Fuck his Scorch.  And then he asked me, he was like, did he tell you?  And I had to be like, yeah, dude.  Oh, shit.  You had to fess up.  I knew that was coming.  Yeah.  Let's get back to this.  This is the big intro for PFG TV.  And then we're going to play the comedian.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  We're trying to give this justice because you've got to understand this.  One day it'll all come together for the listeners.  It's horrid.  It's just...  Well, Scorch will have a national show one day and that's what it'll all come together. 
[00:33:30]  Well, that's what he told us last night.  He goes, eventually I'm going to pay you guys, meaning the crowd.  Right.  Because the show's going to get so big he's going to actually pay the people.  Are you going to pay the crowd?  I'm thinking Oprah doesn't even pay her fucking crowd.  Letterman doesn't pay the crowd.  I think she's kind of big.  Occasionally, she does give out cars.  Yeah.  Favorite things.  And every day, I mean...  Scorch's favorite things.  You get a slice of pizza.  You get a slice of pizza.  You get a slice of pizza.  All right.  I'm out of pizza.  You're on.  That's all the bugs.  We send someone out for some pizza. 
[00:34:00]  It takes money from the audience.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  The pizza never comes.  Maybe the audience could chip in.  Yeah.  And you get a laptop.  Oh, $99 laptop.  That's all I got.  One.  Oops.  One.  Maybe you can share on it.  And I'm having trouble booting it up.  I don't get that.  I don't get that.  I score.  All right.  Let's hit this again.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Watch the name of that band again that's on here tonight.  I love them.  I'm so glad to have them back.  They have a new disc. 
[00:34:30]  We're going to be talking about that.  Five Points is back in the house tonight.  Look at him.  He's just...  So we have a lot of stuff going on.  Why don't we get into things with a segment that we call Weird News.  I forgot about Weird News.  Okay.  For starters, the police in Madison Heights, Michigan.  See, you learn something new every day on Scorch's BFG TV.  Who would have known?  Every day.  Other than Dylan, of course, that there is a Madison Heights, Michigan.  Weird news.  They thought they'd never find the person that robbed several batches of Madison Heights, Michigan. 
[00:35:00]  Did you know that?  Give the fuck.  Did you know?  You learned something new.  Did you know there was a Madison Heights, Michigan?  If it said, like, Manhattan, Michigan or New York, Michigan...  But the question is, did you know there was a Madison Heights, Michigan?  No.  Do you know now?  No.  I already forgot.  There is.  And you should be thinking, Scorch.  But you learned it from Scorch.  Well, thank you, Scorch.  Yeah, we teach here.  And what does he say?  That we stole bits from him?  Yeah, he said...  Will we share bits or what?  He said you guys and him kind of go back and forth with the bits. 
[00:35:30]  He takes a little from you.  You take a little from him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, what did he give us?  Feels for Meals.  Feels for Meals, he says.  Yeah, really?  I mean, it does rhyme.  The beauty is he has no fucking idea that we mock him.  And you guys took douche or dressing.  He has no idea we mock him.  Well, we did take douche or dressing.  I guess we did take that one, sure.  Because who wouldn't?  No.  We took it by making fun of it one day.  Of course.  But in his mind, that means we are doing his best.  Yeah, they appreciate a good bit. 
[00:36:00]  All right, back to the...  Weird news.  Weird news.  It's like weird science.  Yeah, take a fucking 30-year-old movie theme.  You learn something new every day on Scorch's BFG TV.  Who would have known, other than Dylan, of course, that there is a Madison Heights, Michigan.  They thought they'd never find the person that robbed several banks lately because of the wrestling mask the person wore when they robbed the banks.  They thought they wouldn't be able to find that person, but they did. 
[00:36:30]  How?  You're asking yourself right now.  You're saying, how?  About a block away from the last bank the person robbed, they found the mask laying on the street.  Wrapped in the mask was some of the money and the gun.  So, at that point, police figured out it must have been a man and not a woman.  Of course, that made it easy, or it made it easy because in his side, the mask, was the guy's driver's license with his current address.  That's weird. 
[00:37:00]  He's in trouble.  I like the punchline at the end.  Folks in Windsor, Ontario.  Beautiful, beautiful part of the world.  Windsor, Ontario.  I was offered a job.  I was offered a job at CIMX in Windsor, Ontario.  I really.  Of course he was.  Not as good as our radio station, Rock 101.  www.rock101fm.com.  Holy mother. 
[00:37:30]  Now, Jessica, who's our announcer, has commercial-free middays starting in just a couple of days.  Whoa.  Hey, yo.  This is just painful.  They're not too happy the Windsor, Ontario, folks.  80-year-old Jim Masson bought the rights to have parts of a baseball park named after him.  Have you heard the story yet?  No, I have not.  Has anybody heard about the story?  He donated 55 grand to get the scoreboard clock named after him.  Normally, that would be a good thing, 55 grand named the clock.  In this case, it's not because it turns out Mr. Masson is a convicted sex offender involving three men. 
[00:38:00]  He apparently did inappropriate things with, and that's why they do have background checks.  It checks people's background, you know what I mean?  Oh, God.  I know what you mean.  Yeah, it's amazing.  I heard this guy's favorite tune is, take me out to the ball game.  Listen to them laugh.  What do you think, that's a laugh track?  Thank you.  And finally, this is a great one, too. 
[00:38:30]  A man walking into a business in the Florida Keys got caught, but he didn't hear the real silent alarm.  It's always better when there's a laugh track, and then you can hear the audience booing behind the laugh track.  I was distracted watching porn on one of the company computers.  Remember when Doc went into the radio studio the other day and you were looking at porn?  Absolutely, yeah.  What Doc was doing in the building on the overnights, I don't know, but that's okay.  Not only was he looking at porn on the company computers, but his pants were down, and he was what we call taking care of business. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  Taking care of business.  Now he's facing burglary charges.  Breaking and entering charges as well, so these guys got some issues.  I'm a hypnotist.  I'm a key holder, so I'm a great job.  And I guess you can say the cops caught this guy.  You've heard of getting caught red-handed?  This guy was caught red-glended.  And that, my friends, is today's installment of Weird News.  He wrote that joke down.  You know, I was just thinking.  It's a five point. 
[00:39:30]  We're going to have Jessica Taylor.  He says, did you hear about this one?  Did you hear about this one?  For a second, I said to myself, he probably watches Leno and Letterman and takes notes,  but that's not what Scorch does.  Scorch watches Leno and Letterman with people, and he says, in all seriousness,  you know, and he starts criticizing what they do.  We're actually a better show than this show.  Oh, really?  I'm sure of it.  Yeah, yeah.  We're actually a better show.  I heard that monologue.  Weird News is actually better than that monologue.  You know, Weird News, and we got the theme song. 
[00:40:00]  Weird News.  We have segments and stuff.  We're actually a better show than this show.  And I throw up my little jokes after reading the Weird News.  Yeah.  Dude.  Let's take a little song.  Red glided.  Red glided.  Get it?  And then he moves on to a local band and interviews them.  And the local band is all like middle-aged guys.  Middle-aged.  They are fucking...  I said, hey, one of the guys got to be a grandfather.  Yeah.  And they're still trying to make it.  One guy was wearing a shirt that said the rat on it, because, you know, the rat from Boston, 
[00:40:30]  that has been closed for how long?  I don't even know.  Like...  Hey, don't mention the competition.  And I know...  Hey, wait a minute.  I think it closed like the first year we were up in Boston.  So, 95, I'm guessing.  Yeah.  And I know this guy probably played the grand opening of the place.  He was a grandfather.  Right.  Retro.  And then the lead singer looks like just a regular guy.  He looked like every guy I saw on every job site, a steam fitter, a plumber.  Right, right, right.  Doesn't look like he should be a rocker. 
[00:41:00]  Whatever.  Not a rocker.  And then you got a guy that's sort of trying to look hip, but he doesn't look hip.  And then they say that they're drummers from Godsmack.  And Scorch doesn't call him out on it.  No.  Because we kind of know Godsmack over the years.  Why would Scorch call him out?  Well, Scorch likes that.  Maybe he was in Godsmack one day because somebody was sick.  Scorch loves embellishment of people's achievements, especially himself.  Right.  Scorch likes the idea of people watching his show and thinking the drummer from Godsmack.  He's on his couch.  Yeah.  And then it was just sad because the band is talking about how they're making another  CD and they're hoping to make it someday. 
[00:41:30]  They're going to make it.  Make it.  Later on in the show, they played like a 10-minute song that was kind of Spinal Tap-ish slash any  kind of band you'll see locally.  Yeah.  As you put it, it was Spinal Tap meets any shitty local band.  Right.  Right.  And that's what it was.  It turned into some opus where the regular guy that you've seen a million times on the  job site was trying to show the world that he has a tortured soul as he's singing. 
[00:42:00]  Angst and stuff.  Yeah, man.  Well, Scorch has seen people come from nothing and become world famous.  Do you guys know?  He told me this.  So he, I wish he was in here today.  He got Triple H into pro wrestling.  You know what?  I was going to ask Triple H that Friday.  Oh, my God.  And then William H. Macy showed up a little early.  I got him adacting.  That was me.  But that's when Scorch was Vito Carlucci.  Yeah, he said that he brought Triple H into the wrestling game.  And China.  And China, too, huh?  Yeah, both of them. 
[00:42:30]  Anyway.  He sure does embellish.  I don't know.  Finally, we get to the point why we're talking about PFG TV today.  Thanks to that guy that tweeted me.  So he had this comedian on.  So you got to hear this comedian.  You just got to.  It's just not bad.  Not bad.  You're Scorch introducing the comedian.  This is comedian Josh Condelman on Scorch's VFG TV.  Yeah, Scorch's VFG TV.  Branding.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you, Scorch.  Thank you.  It's good to be here with someone else who is bald and whose name is a verb. 
[00:43:00]  So that's very exciting.  Thank you.  Nothing.  Well, something.  There was one laugh I heard.  Yeah, Scorch laughs through this whole thing, by the way.  Just listen to.  Because this guy.  Because it's his reputation.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got to have a funny comic on his late night TV show.  On my late night show.  I got to have a comic.  I got to have a band.  I got to do everything.  And in Scorch's head, if the audience hears Scorch laughing, they'll think it's funny.  Right.  Because whatever Scorch says is, you know, gospel. 
[00:43:30]  But this guy.  Now, mind you, there are, albeit a few, but there are people in this room.  They give this comic nothing.  Nothing at all.  And he deserves nothing.  And the comic is feeling it.  Oh, yeah.  He's awful.  I guess he's a teacher when he's not doing stand-up.  Yeah.  And he might be.  We don't know, though.  He seems a little light in the loafers.  We're not sure.  From listening to him.  Yeah.  But that's important because Scorch doesn't really pick up on the fact that he might be. 
[00:44:00]  He Regis Philbin's this thing.  Oh, he totally does.  And asks him a heterosexual type question.  But we don't know for sure.  We don't know.  Who does know?  But here's more of Josh.  I just know that if I ever adopted a child, I'd have no idea how to break the news to him.  I'd probably have to go to Barnes & Noble and get a book called How to Tell Your Son He's Adopted.  and just leave it on the counter until he found it on his own. 
[00:44:30]  That's a joke?  Oh, boy.  This is great.  Go on, buddy.  A doctor.  You're a PFG comic.  I'll tell you that.  Pretty effing great.  Yes.  Pretty fucking great.  I'm very open-minded, right?  Try to love all sorts of people.  That's one of my messages, right?  That's what I try to instill in the kids.  That's what I try to say in on stage.  I love all sorts of people.  Here's the way I'm open-minded, everyone.  I love lesbians and not just for their work on film. 
[00:45:00]  True.  Thank you.  I hope.  Thank you.  I hope I have a lesbian daughter.  Not out there in the world now.  Goodness, no.  But when I have a daughter, on purpose, I hope that she is the lesbian kind.  Because I feel like it would really cut the sex talk down to a more manageable length.  Lesbian daughter, right?  We can all agree.  Teen pregnancy, pretty much off the table.  Teen pregnancy.  So it'd be kind of a one-sentence discussion. 
[00:45:30]  Just like, hey, honey.  Have fun out there.  You're living the dream.  Make daddy proud.  Holy fuck.  I'll tell you guys this before I scoot.  There's a story about the cutest kid in my class.  And you're not supposed to pick a favorite, but some of those little jerks make it so easy to narrow it down.  Which I think is ethical. 
[00:46:00]  Cutest kid.  Smallest kid.  Only three and a half.  All the other kids are four, four and a half, five.  And he's got a very thick Mexican accent, which is very charming.  So he comes up to me the day before Halloween and he says to me,  Yosh.  Because that's how you say Josh with a very thick Mexican accent.  The J's become wise.  And I don't quibble because I like the arrangement the Mexican people and I have with burritos.  And I don't want to jeopardize that in any way.  So he says, Yosh.  And I say, Jess.  Yeah, I know what that means.  He goes, I'm going to be Batman.  And I go, oh, you mean like when you grow up?  And he goes, Jesus Cristo, no. 
[00:46:30]  Now, I mean like right now, I am Bruce Wayne.  But later, when they put on my outfit, then I am Batman.  I was like, oh, that's adorable.  So the next day is Halloween.  He comes in.  He's wearing his Batman outfit, just flexing, happy as a clam or a bat or whatever.  Until the middle of the day, where I just see him crouched by himself looking sad.  And I go, what's wrong, dude?  And he stands up and I can see that he'd wet his pants.  And I go, oh, no, buddy.  Did Batman have a little accident?  And he goes, Jesus Cristo, no. 
[00:47:00]  Bruce Wayne peed in my outfit.  Thank you guys very much.  It was a real pleasure.  Thank you, guys.  That was great.  Have a seat, man.  Relax.  Very cool.  There it is.  The invite over to the couch by Scorch right there.  New Hampshire has a new star.  We're almost done with this, but people are confused.  This is a guy we used to work with up there in Boston because they're just tuning in.  Scorch.  And now he does a TV show that is so bad.  He has a lot of confidence. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  But he has no awareness of himself.  It's on in New Hampshire and it is also on in Syracuse.  Right.  But he pays for his own TV show, but he makes it sound like he was recruited to do TV now.  Oh, yeah.  Like he was called up.  And what you just heard was a comic bombing and then Scorch because now he wants to play  the Johnny Carson role.  He's inviting him to sit down on the couch because that's what Johnny used to do.  I'm a star maker. 
[00:48:00]  I'm a star maker.  You guys should be careful as far as how much you like this because yesterday in the mail,  I just got the entire month of January of PFG TV episodes.  I'm not joking, Tim.  What?  Burn me a copy.  Holy shit.  I have to watch every show now.  I have a source up there.  Actually, just burn it.  It's just set on fire.  Burning a copy.  Just burn it.  Yeah, I need a copy of that.  I'll burn some copies.  Wow.  All right.  And here's Scorch asking the guy that might be a little light in the loafers. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is what he asked the comic.  Did you, and be honest about this, because Lord knows I have.  Do you ever look at one of the kid's parents and go, damn.  You know, do you ever see a MILF?  Oh, do you ever see a MILF?  Um, no comment?  Can I go no comment?  But, like, no comment?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  See?  Get it?  No comment?  Scorch couldn't pick up on the fact that that lisp and talk that he has. 
[00:49:00]  And the fact that out of nowhere he brought up a joke about adopting a child.  Yeah, adopting a child, not having a child.  Right, right.  Loving everyone, open-mindedness.  Open-mindedness, open-ass-edness.  Not that we know one way or the other.  You should ask them about filths.  Yeah.  Not MILFs.  A filth.  A filth.  A filth.  What are you into, filths?  Dilths?  Yeah.  All right, we're just about done, but Scorch talked to little Dylan. 
[00:49:30]  He was very excited that Dylan was back on his show.  Well, yeah, Dylan was in promoting cancer.  Which is obviously horrible, but there's a way to deal with cancer, kids.  Try to keep it light, but get the message out there.  And I think Scorch missed that opportunity here.  Dylan!  This is our pal, Dylan Thompson, on Scorch's Band TV.  Dylan!  Thank you, Dylan.  Tell you, man.  Dylan! 
[00:50:00]  Hey, man.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  So what's going on, Dylan?  What's happening, bro?  You don't want to talk to me, huh?  He's going to be one of those ones again.  Somebody's got to talk.  So, Don, talk to us about Dylan.  What's up with him?  What's going on?  Dylan has neurofibromatosis.  Oh, I did get that right.  Yeah.  I don't care what he has, but I pronounced it right, I think.  He's patting himself on the back.  Oh, I got it right.  Oh, yeah.  You know how horrific that is, Scorch?  Any clue?  This is one of the lighthearted segments. 
[00:50:30]  Right.  Any clue how horrific this disease is?  Hey, so what's up, Dylan?  I'm dying.  All right.  Yeah.  BFG.  So is that comic.  Did you see his act?  Fibromatosis.  Oh, I did get that right.  It causes tumors to grow anywhere, anytime, and there's no predictable course and there  is no cure.  So the Children's Tumor Foundation uses their donations for research and for family support. 
[00:51:00]  For family support, the tumor.  Yeah, the Tumor Foundation.  You're right.  The worst name for a foundation.  The Tumor Foundation.  No, the Tumor Children's Tumor Foundation.  Children's Tumor Foundation.  The Children's Tumor Foundation.  Scorch is also using the moment when she says that this young child grows tumors randomly  every place throughout his body and there is no cure to giggle at the little kid as he's  playing, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey, hey.  He's giggling. 
[00:51:30]  He's not paying attention to that point.  He don't care.  And then there was something in there.  I'm playing whack a tumor on the kid.  One pops up.  I hit it down.  Another one pops up.  I'd wipe that one down.  And then he used that opportunity to snore.  It sounded like.  Making noises and stuff.  You're boring me.  And then finally, the TV show ends.  And, you know.  Conversely.  He's kind of doing.  Now he's decided he's got to do the SNL thing and have everybody that was part of the show  on stage as he closes the show. 
[00:52:00]  That's the big set.  He's barring from a lot of different shows.  Oh, he certainly is.  But he's watching SNL going, you know, our ending is a little better than that.  Our ending is better because we actually talk a little more and, you know, interact with  the people.  A little personality.  People like that.  So, I'll be honest.  The last hour of our show was a complete waste of time.  What?  And we should have just played this one clip I'm about to play.  Oh, geez.  It's hype.  So, hopefully you're still listening.  Scorch decides he needs Dylan, cancer kid on his shoulders.  Tumor kid. 
[00:52:30]  As he closes PFG TV.  Yeah, tumor kid.  Right.  You know, where tumors pop up.  Tumors grow on him.  Throughout his entire body.  Yeah.  And there's no cure.  Right.  And Scorch, being extremely clueless, says this.  Hey.  All of a sudden, I got like this growth.  This growth on my neck.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  That's my pal, Dylan.  Anyhow, you know, Dylan that grows tumors.  Grows tumors.  He had them on his shoulders.  At the end, he had them on his shoulders with the rest of the crew.  They're all around waving and everything. 
[00:53:00]  And Scorch is talking.  And he's got the tumor kid on his neck.  And he says, all of a sudden, I feel like I have a growth on my neck.  Hey.  All of a sudden, I got like this growth.  This growth on my neck.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  That's my pal, Dylan.  Anyhow.  Yeah, that's my pal, Dylan.  Unfortunately for Dylan, Dylan can't say that.  No, no.  Because Dylan's growth is tumors.  It's true.  Scorch.  He called the tumor kid a tumor.  Yeah.  And there's no cure for it.  They pop up anywhere.  He's a little kid.  But let's have fun with it, even though we don't even know we're having fun with it. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, that's Scorch.  Wow.  Why did everybody look so surprised?  What's the problem?  Who said what now?  I don't get it.  I don't get that.  I don't get that.  I don't get that.  Because it wasn't a joke.  Yeah.  No one else did either.  He's trying to be ironic.  He's great.  And humorless.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  It's a segment I like to call tumor humor.  Tumor humor.  He likes to rhyme.  Tumor humor. 
[00:54:00]  I mean, this is the same guy who pretended on the radio that this day is the anniversary  of the jungle gym because he found a list of top ten people named Jim that he wanted  to do so badly and needed a reason.  We're going to play a game.  It's called Pants or Cancer.  I'm wearing pants or do I have tumors on my leg?  Pants or Cancer?  Call up now.  Oh, looky, looky, Miss Cookie. 
[00:54:30]  Looky, looky, Miss Cookie.  That's what he said when the phone rang, right?  Yeah.  When all three phone lines were ringing.  He got excited.  That meant all three of our phone lines were full.  Then he had a full house.  Yeah, three people were calling.  Three people.  All three phone lines.  Looky, looky, Miss Cookie.  Brain cell stimulator worked today.  He has a trivia question called the brain cell stimulator.  Brain cell stimulator.  I can learn from him.  Did you ever see him mad?  No, but he lied to himself, so it's like, you know, you have to live in a shroud of... 
[00:55:00]  Does he make money?  No.  How does he live?  Well, he makes enough money to get by.  Yeah, how does he do this?  Is he just renting?  No, he makes, like, a low annual income, and then, you know, he tricks people into giving  him money on the side for stuff.  Really?  Like, sponsors and stuff.  He just pockets all that, I'm sure.  He's just wheeling and dealing?  Yeah.  At one point, oh my god, at one point, we were in Syracuse. 
[00:55:30]  He was the morning guy in Syracuse on Rock 105, the dog, and between talk breaks, during  the songs, he goes, yeah, I got a pretty sweet deal.  I got a friend over at a Mexican restaurant.  He's going to let me work in the kitchen off the books.  Off the books.  So that's what he's going to do in the afternoons, working in a Mexican restaurant in the kitchen.  That's how I roll.  Where do you guys work in the afternoons?  That's how I roll.  Do you guys work at a restaurant?  Restaurant in the afternoons.  That's what my second half of my day. 
[00:56:00]  I'd rather not say, because I don't want to be, you know, made fun of by the listeners.  He was a cashier at a tattoo parlor for a while.  While he was, you know, a big radio disc jockey.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  What do you want to do, piercing?  I know we haven't done this justice, but we're going to keep trying, because you,  when you finally understand this whole Scorch world, it's just some of the most amazing  stuff to follow.  It really is amazing.  Scorch is the definition of long form. 
[00:56:30]  Like, you've got to stick in there for a while, but when you get it, you really, he is, he's,  you know, he's the David Brent of radio.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  The David Brent of radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really thinks.  A hundred percent.  Yeah.  Because he, he should be behind that desk on TV crying, but he has no idea.  He's like listening to his tapes.  He's like, I'm hilarious.  He's making no money.  He thinks at any moment, he's going to get the big fucking gig.  Yep.  He thinks he's Johnny Carson when the comics come on.  Right.  Wow.  He thinks he's like Carson Daly interviewing bands. 
[00:57:00]  And then he does the SNL thing at the end.  Yeah.  And then he's doing punchline jokes like Leno and fucking Letterman.  He's got that sharp, that wit, that, that he could, he could just improv.  He could throw shit out.  He's doing weird, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.  And then he's got lines for the story.  Yeah.  And then he could break it down and go serious when he talks to Tumor Kid.  Yeah, right.  Then he could do a serious segment, but still keep it light enough where, you know, people  aren't uncomfortable.  It doesn't get maudlin.  You don't want to bring the audience down. 
[00:57:30]  But he's making everyone extremely uncomfortable and not in a good way.  He can't pull any of those things off that we've just mentioned.  He is the host of the afternoon Lumpa Nation.  What?  What?  That's what they call it.  Rock 101 in Manchester calls their fans the Lumpa Nation.  That's why he had to stop.  Manch Vegas?  Manch Vegas.  That's why he had to stop doing Naked Militia because the station had already branded their  fans are the Lumpa Nation.  Why Lumpa?  I don't know what it means.  It's like Lumpa Lumpa. 
[00:58:00]  I have no idea what it means.  Well, when we used to work with him at AF, it was the kingdom of nakedness, right?  Right, yeah.  And then it was...  Wait, was it Nude Radio?  Wait, what?  Naked Radio?  How did he say Nude Radio?  Totally Nude Radio.  Totally Nude Radio.  Totally Nude Radio.  The kingdom of nakedness.  And I remember something else that happened because he came on after us and then we would  do production.  We'd be around the station.  We'd come in and say hi to Scorch.  You know, back then we were extremely motivated.  And then all of a sudden, he gives the illusion that he's naked doing his radio show.  So then if you come in to say hi, he's like, oh, Opie and Anthony here.  They're nude too. 
[00:58:30]  I'm like, no, Scorch, we're not nude.  They're all naked.  We're not hanging out with you nude.  We just came in to say hi.  Well, then he moved to Syracuse and he became the naked militia.  No one's nude.  Naked militia because now we're going to stand up for a right to be naked.  Right to bear a penis.  The naked militia.  He believes that the ONA army came from one place.  Naked militia.  You guys heard about the naked militia and started the ONA army.  He didn't say that.  He did, I swear.  We never had an ONA army.  He said the ONA army.  We never really did the army thing.  No.  Because that's kind of hack.  Yeah, a lot of people have done that. 
[00:59:00]  I mean, we did our hack and shit, but...  But you had a militia.  Naked militia.  Naked militia.  And he said that the reason for that was that when people are naked, everybody's equal.  So how can you fight when everybody's naked?  The right to scorch your listeners to bear ass shall not be infringed upon.  But he wasn't naked.  Naked militia.  And then guys are coming in just to say hi, and now we're naked.  I'm like, we're not naked.  I don't get that.  He used to brag about wearing Drakkar.  Drakkar. 
[00:59:30]  He would wear Drakkar.  We don't want to give the impression that we're...  It was good.  The ladies like it.  Me and Aunt don't want to give the impression that we're naked in front of other guys, Scorch.  The ladies like it.  You guys did a naked show or two with Scorch, though, in Boston, right?  Yeah.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Dude, why'd you guys take all your clothes off?  It's just like, Scorch, why would you want to give that impression?  Yeah, Scorch, why are you trying to paint that picture?  We don't have any clothes on.  No, we do, Scorch.  Wow.  I don't know.  We're taking our pants off.  You know what? 
[01:00:00]  It makes us fucking laugh our balls off.  I don't know.  That certainly does.  We're very fond of Scorch.  I hope he doesn't get the right impression.  I don't have a lot of confidence in how we present Scorch yet.  But you know what?  Damn it.  We're going to try again because...  Oh, yeah.  We're going to try again.  I don't want to stop.  Yeah.  It'll come across.  I think there's some good stuff in there.  Yeah, definitely.  Fucking Sam has tears in his eyes.  He was laughing.  Tears in his eyes, I guess.  I love Scorch.  All right, we'll take a break and we'll start our radio show.  How's that sound?  Yes.  Totally nude. 
[01:00:30]  iPad 2.0 coming out next week.  That's what they're saying.  Yeah.  Any line on what the new additions are going to be?  Not a new screen.  They're saying they got a one megapixel camera.  Whoa.  What?  They usually add more shit in than just like what you hear about before they announce it.  Yeah.  It's got to be something impressive because we're all loving our iPads, so why would we  get rid of these so quickly?  So it's got to be something.  Probably be hard driving.  When are they going to announce that?  Probably next week.  I don't think.  Maybe USB? 
[01:01:00]  I don't think we'll see a USB.  USB would be nice.  Why?  USB would be nice.  It would be nice, but I don't think we'll see it.  Because then they're just building a computer.  Yeah.  I mean a laptop.  It actually flips open now.  It comes with the standard Apple OS.  That Apple confuses me.  We were able to get everything down to tiny, and now they're like, no, we need big now.  Yeah.  They kind of...  And then this is going to turn into a laptop, but it's like we always had the laptop.  It's all fluid.  Everything's in flux here.  I'm very confused, but man, they know what they're doing. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Big or small.  All right, we'll talk about maybe some Libya action.  Qaddafi.  Got some thoughts on that, I'm sure.  Libya's Labias.  We're going to be doing a show, Libya or Labia?  We're going to hear people screaming, and is it from touching their Labia or getting shot in Libya?  Scorch thinks of names like that.  Oh, of course.  But he never thinks of how the game would actually be played.  Name first, game second.  Then we'll figure out how to be going on.  Name then game.  I'm going to play name then game. 
[01:02:00]  We're going to come up with a name and then play the game.  And look, I just did it again.  It's like a paradox.  They did it again when we get back.  Paradox.  They love them at Rock 101?  Yeah.  I mean, that's a pretty big rock station up there.  A lot of morning shows have gone on to big things.  Name that game.  Hey, paradox or paradox?  Is it two doctors or some kind of space-time mix-up?  Paradox or paradox?  You can do anything with Scorch.  We got Miju Kagu and Doc Brown here. 
[01:02:30]  Paradox.  But it's also a paradox.  Because what did they talk about?  What if you had two Doc Browns?  Holy shit.  I don't get that.  I don't understand.  I don't get that.  Then it'd be a paradox.  I don't get that.  He once said that, I mean, he would go into what he was writing off as taxes.  He said he wrote off $10,000 worth of toothpicks.  Because he's always got a toothpick in his mouth.  But then Paul and me started doing the math.  And $10,000 worth of toothpicks is an obscene amount of toothpicks. 
[01:03:00]  There's no way.  It would probably fill up this entire studio.  I forgot.  That's his thing.  He has a toothpick in it.  But we didn't have a toothpick.  I thought last night, I was watching, when I was watching last night, I'm like, does  he have a toothpick in his mouth?  Yeah.  Like the whole time.  Maybe I talk.  I'm like Muggsy.  Yeah, see?  See, boss?  Yeah, I got a toothpick in my mouth.  When's the next one?  Next.  I mean, PFG TV's on every week.  It is.  Oh, yeah.  And there's now the website, right?  We should plug the website for the people that do care enough to maybe see the visual. 
[01:03:30]  What is it?  PFG dash?  I think it's dash.  It is dash, right?  Dot com.  PFG dash TV dot com, I guess.  Okay.  Greatest site ever.  And I'll make you guys some DVD copies.  Oh, please.  I mean, a PFG TV party in the big movie theater.  Oh, my God.  I would love to just sit in the theater and do a festival.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  All this guy wants to tell us about Lump Nation.  Lump Nation.  Or Lumpa?  Lumpa Nation. 
[01:04:00]  Lumpa Nation.  It's the afternoon Lumpa Nation with Scorch.  John in New Hampshire.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, brother.  The whole Lumpa is basically your working guy, your working Joe.  And it was, it's not even his.  It's the morning show that is on his station and the station on the seacoast, which is both  owned by Cheap Channel.  Wait, he doesn't even do mornings?  Is it like you're a Lumpa shit?  Like you're a Lumpa shit?  You're a Lump?  Yep.  And they call it Lumpa? 
[01:04:30]  Lumpa Nation.  You're a worker.  You got this decal that goes on.  They're morning shows.  You know, it's all right.  But it's a couple of people.  And then, no, he does the afternoons.  And he sucks.  Oh, don't say that.  We love the sports.  We do not have the news.  I think the morning show on that station is like Greg and the Morning Buzz.  Yeah, it is.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  And it's on both stations.  And they're in Portsmouth.  He's in Manchester.  And they, you know, they're going by the same company.  Playing tunes in the afternoon.  That's what I like to call it. 
[01:05:00]  Playing the tunes in the afternoon.  Yeah, but Scorch is only out of Manchester right now.  But he is working on a lot of different markets.  He'll be all over the world very soon.  He told me.  I think SiriusXM is going to hire him very soon.  Well, I mean, he told me that.  It's a very high-level contract.  I mean, yeah, the merger slowed it down a little bit.  But now that we're back on track, probably Scorch coming here soon on the virus.  Yep.  He's on the afternoons.  And I'll tell you the reason why he's got people following him.  He's got no competition.  There's no other stations in this area. 
[01:05:30]  We live in Manchester.  What else is near here?  Nothing.  All right.  That's it.  He's carved out a little niche for himself.  Of course, Manchester is near Boston.  Thanks, brother.  He told everybody in Syracuse he was going to Boston.  Me.  I'm going to Boston.  We'll take our first break.  And we've got Rich Voss coming in today.  Yes, we do.  And John Leguizamo.  John Leguizamo's coming in, eh?  With Fisher Stevens.  Remember him?  Right.  You remember Fisher Stevens?  Well, from, you know, Short Circuit. 
[01:06:00]  Short Circuit.  But he was also in Lost.  He also directed The Cove, I believe.  Produced, I think.  Produced?  Produced.  Produced The Cove.  It was a terrific documentary.  You just film some dolphins being slaughtered.  Exactly.  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gotta go to a sponsor break.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  For the virus.  Sirius XM.  Rich Voss is in the studio today helping us out. 
[01:06:30]  What's up?  What's up?  Hi.  Hi, Rich.  How are you?  Good.  Good.  I got semi-sleep last night. 
[01:07:00]  Semi-sleep?  Semi-sleep.  So you're semi-well-rested?  Semi-well-rested.  Yeah, that's a bitch, man.  A little drift.  Over the weekend, I was working in Baltimore, and at the hotel I was staying at, there was  a science fiction convention.  Oh, boy.  I've never seen so many nerds in one place.  I'm telling you, they were the worst.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting there, and then there was black nerds, which are even worse than white nerds. 
[01:07:30]  That's got to be really sad for them.  Well, because they're hated by people in general, and then black people call them Uncle Tom, so  they're hated twice over.  Yeah.  Like, the black nerds are worse.  I felt worse for them.  Yeah, because they got no street cred with the other black guys, and they're not quite  accepted for the white people, except, you know, if they're going to, maybe Geordi from  The Next Generation, Star Trek, is talking.  Yeah.  I've been at hotels when they had Star Trek conventions. 
[01:08:00]  Star Trek.  But this one made that.  Did I say Star Trek, I said?  Okay.  I thought it was Star Trek.  Star Trek, track, whatever.  Whatever.  One letter, one letter, big deal.  It's just one letter.  A or E.  That's okay.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  It's a vowel.  Okay, Viss.  Okay.  It doesn't matter.  No one remembers me.  Jesus.  So sad.  So, these nerds, it was ridiculous how nerdy, and I heard people from this show go to those 
[01:08:30]  conventions.  Yeah, a lot of people.  No, I mean at work here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, E-Rock goes, right?  There was a girl.  E-Rock, Sam.  Really?  Danny.  How do you mean to go to Baltimore?  It was a biggie.  I go to comp.  No.  I don't usually go to Star Trek stuff, but I'll go to like a horror movie convention  if there's some good people.  What about science fiction?  This was all, like there was a girl signing pictures, like some actress with blonde hair,  very pretty.  She flew in, and I'm thinking, okay, let's say she signs 100 autographs. 
[01:09:00]  Let's say, let's say she charges 10 bucks.  No, it's never 10.  How much for a signed order picture?  Usually it's 20.  20 is like the minimum that you'll ever find at one of those conventions.  And then there's other stuff too.  It's like if you want a picture, some guys charge for a picture.  Some people charge if you want to bring your own item.  You know, like if I have a DVD, I want you to sign it.  Oh, yeah.  That's going to be more.  It's like that might be 30 instead of 20.  Okay, well, this girl, the most I would imagine she signed was 50.  What did she do?  Do you know who she was? 
[01:09:30]  She was blonde hair.  Yeah.  But what was the name of the con?  I can look it up.  What was the name of the what?  Of the convention?  Do you know what it was?  I don't know.  It was in Baltimore over the weekend.  But if she signed 50 for $20 a piece, that's a nice grant.  That's a thousand bucks.  That's nice.  That's nice to fly in and she had somebody with her and get a room and flight and I don't know.  She got mad at me.  But the promoters, don't the promoters pay some of these people to be at the convention?  I think so, yeah.  I believe the promoters are possibly flying her in and putting her up. 
[01:10:00]  Depends on how popular you are.  Maybe they pay her travel expenses and then she banks the cash.  And I walked up to her like she was hot.  You wouldn't take $1,000 for just sitting there signing your name 50 times?  Are you kidding me?  I'd take $1,000 just to say 50 minutes worth of horrible jokes.  I, uh, so I walk up to her, you know, like, hey.  Do you know who it was?  Oh, no.  He'll find her.  What store?  I mean, what show?  Jesus.  She was in a movie, I think.  What movie, Rich? 
[01:10:30]  Fucking science fiction.  Break it down, baby.  Blonde hair, hot.  So I walk up to her.  I walk up to her.  Like there hasn't been a thousand of those.  Tens of thousands.  Well, okay.  She was under 17, so I'm sure you know her.  Was she a kid?  Was she young?  No, she was hot.  What frustrates me about you, you don't give us enough info to actually find the person.  Blonde in a science fiction movie.  Are you serious?  Laurie Holden.  Oh.  Bonita Friedrich. 
[01:11:00]  It was the Farpoint.  Oh, you can tell me any name.  The Farpoint convention.  I have to see her face.  If we showed up.  The Farpoint website sucks so much.  The fucking con was like just the, I guess, over the weekend.  I can't find who was there.  Really?  There's no fucking guest list.  Well, can we pop a couple of these names in the Google image?  Yeah.  So I walk up to her like, you know, hey, I'm also an entertainer.  When I walk up to her table, I go, I hope you're not judging these people.  And she looked at me like, who the fuck do you think you are?  Wow, really?  She gave me this, you know, like trying to be funny, you know. 
[01:11:30]  Uh-huh.  You know, please don't judge these people.  And she looked at me like, ugh, be gone.  And I just like walked away, got in the elevator.  All right.  Who is that?  Is that her?  Yeah, that's her.  Which one?  The one in the middle.  That's the, from Walking Dead, the blonde chick.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, she's the fucking wife from Walking Dead, right?  Is that a big one, Danny?  I don't even know.  Well, if you like the show, I guess.  Yeah.  Okay.  She's kind of new on the scene.  It's not like you're getting a, you know, a classic. 
[01:12:00]  She's on the TV show now.  Yeah.  And she flew in from L.A.  And her arms.  Walking Dead's a hot show.  It's like the biggest ratings for AMC.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's a zombie show.  Sean in North Carolina, because you said, what's one letter, right?  Yeah.  One letter, Voss.  And then this question's for you, Rich.  Which would you rather have in your mouth, duck or dick?  That's funny.  It's just one letter.  Just one letter.  How many ducks are selling crack? 
[01:12:30]  Just one little letter.  That's funny.  That's good.  Look at that.  We have a little scrambler here.  A little letter scrambler.  What?  So that was my weekend story from science fiction.  How's Baltimore?  You got stuck there, huh?  I was at a club.  Is Baltimore a nice place?  No.  I hear it down near the water.  It's a chalk outline.  It's a nice place.  It's a nice place.  What about the, what is it called?  Inner Harbor?  Inner Harbor.  Is that a nice area? 
[01:13:00]  Is that where the club is?  No, this is in town, outside of Baltimore.  You always say the closest nearest city.  Right.  But it's not even near.  But the new club I worked was a great club.  It was like 300 seats, theater.  It was a great club.  And the radio was actually fun down there.  The guy did, I played golf with him.  It was good radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it was fun.  Baltimore, downtown, you know, the Inner Harbor.  On the harbor there, like they have all the restaurants and stuff.  And also on the water, they have a, that's where Domino's has their sugar factory. 
[01:13:30]  On the water, so like rats are like hitchhiking from New York to go and swim up to them.  That's got to be some good shit.  The sugar factory is right there?  On the water.  Does it smell all nice?  What?  That's heaven for a rat.  The sugar factory, like when you're around there, does it smell all sweet?  Oh, no.  No?  Because some factories smell good.  Do they really?  Yeah, you ever drive like certain parts of like Brooklyn smell like, like, what are 
[01:14:00]  those kids, like Starburst fruit chews?  No, we spend our Saturdays going maybe, you know, out to the mall or, you know, maybe up  into the, we don't drive, hey kids, we're going to go smell factories today.  I thought if you were near it, you might have, you know, gotten a waft.  Dad, what do we wear for factory smelling?  Factory smelling day.  Rich, just take this as a joke because I know how sensitive you can be.  What?  This is funny though.  Tom in Vegas.  Go ahead, Tom.  I can't hear.  Can we just listen to an hour of Scorched? 
[01:14:30]  Wait, oh.  Can we listen to Voss towards his ass?  Wait, say it again?  Start from the beginning.  He fucked it up.  What did he say?  Did you make us listen to an hour of Scorched to make Voss seem not so bad?  Oh.  First of all, you fucking asshole, I've been in here.  He's telling good stories about his weekend.  I haven't, I haven't failed.  I feel like I, I never fail in studio and I'm, I feel like I'm, I feel like I'm in Baltimore  as I listen to you.  You're really painting a nice picture of the rats and the sugar factory.  Yeah, stuff like that. 
[01:15:00]  I come in, you know, I, the comedy club is almost in Baltimore.  I got it.  It's very visual.  Maybe I'll be like certain comics and yell about white people and this is how girls  are, uh, you know, what, what do you want?  You know, white people.  Yeah.  They crazy.  Crazy crackers.  What about, uh, Gaddafi?  Got anything on that, Rich?  It's a big story.  We're going to lose Gaddafi.  He's been, he's been, uh, what?  He's been the man for 40 years, right?  40 years or so, uh.  Well, we should have lost, we should have taken him out after Lockerbie, all right? 
[01:15:30]  That's when we should have knocked him, that's when we should have went in and I don't  know.  Lockerbie.  That's what we're going to be playing today in commemoration.  Is it a lock or is it a beat?  You guess.  That's when we should have taken him out.  Yeah.  You know.  You think they kill him or he, uh, commits to suicide, Ant?  Nah, he's, he's not going to kill himself.  He's going to, uh, try to squash this.  He doesn't really care about what the world thinks about him.  But no.  How's he going to, how's he going to squash it?  All his people are leaving.  Yeah, but he's got enough. 
[01:16:00]  You think he still has enough people behind him?  He's going to bomb the shit out of protesters and just open fire on him.  He already started, though.  Yeah, he's killing a bunch of these people.  I think it's up to a thousand around him.  You've got to quill the uprising.  Yeah, it's going to be rough.  You've got to do.  I play those video games.  I know how that works.  You've just got to squash the fucking dissidents.  He's a weirdo, though, man.  Did you, did you, uh, listen to any of the speeches?  Wait a minute.  It's like crazy talk.  Muammar Gaddafi's a weirdo?  Is that what Opie, are you saying that?  Yeah.  Why, you, you know something? 
[01:16:30]  I'll have to research him a little.  Just, just call me Captain Obvious today.  Well, why does he look up to the sky when he talks?  He's talking to like God.  Is he?  Allah or something like that.  I can't look you in the face because you can't believe what he's saying.  I can't do that.  The other night on stage, my kid, my daughter came to a club with her friends.  You know, there's like five, 20, 21 year olds.  And I'm talking about, you know, licking jizz off my stomach.  I can't even look at him the whole time.  I'm on stage.  I focus.  And that's why you can't look at people certain times when you're saying things. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  And Gaddafi's like that.  You couldn't have just.  Gaddafi had a look up in the air.  You couldn't take the jizz jokes out of your set because your daughter was in front?  No.  No, there was 300 people.  You have plenty of material.  I know, but there's.  The jizz jokes go over well, though, right?  This one's a new good one about where guys, you know, before they jerk off.  I said this in the studio a couple of times ago where right before they jerk off, you  know, when they're all crazy in the head, like guys get crazy before they jerk off.  Right.  They go, this time I'm going to taste it.  And it lands and then they get it on their finger.  I don't. 
[01:17:30]  What?  I never had that thought.  No.  Yeah, then you get it and then you get it to your mouth and you go, nah.  Come on.  What?  No, really.  No, really, no.  Really.  Most guys out there.  I know a lot of your listeners have.  Most guys, huh?  Yeah.  I said, yeah, this time I'm going to taste it.  This time.  But it never happens.  This time I'm going to.  It never happens because after you come, then you lose all your craziness and all your  Your craziness goes out with the jizz.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All that craziness is in there.  And then you just feel funny.  Yeah.  It's like, ah, I better fucking get up and actually do something productive. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  You're like, why did I, you know, why did I even shoot this load on my stomach?  I knew I was going to eat it.  I should have done it into a towel so it's, you know, felt the same and clean up would  have been easy to clean up.  We used to do it.  We used to do a bit where we talked about how you, you were crazy with your girl and got  into some wild shit.  Oh yeah.  And then as soon as, yeah, as soon as you're done, all that craziness goes away.  And now you're looking at all this awfulness around the bed and it's just like, oh my God,  we're fucking lunatics. 
[01:18:30]  We're fucking nuts.  And then you're putting stuff in the, in the dishwasher to clean it off.  It's funny.  But 20 minutes earlier, it all made sense.  Oh, Bonnie does that.  Like, you know, oh, I can't, put it away, put it back in the closet.  I don't want to see that again.  Put it back in the case.  She's the only one that watches like pornos, like where their eyes have closed.  Why?  But why is that?  As soon as, as soon as you're done, man, then you're right.  That craziness drastically goes away quick. 
[01:19:00]  It's not even a slow fade.  You go from this all makes sense to holy shit.  I'm the biggest creep alive.  I've told this story on stage a million times where I picked up this girl.  Long story short, we're getting ready to go into a hotel that has no cars in a parking  lot.  It was like a crack hotel.  So I'm sitting out front and before I go in to get the room for $20 or $18, you know,  she jerks me off or blows me and I shoot a load and I go, wait here. 
[01:19:30]  And I walk in and come back and go, they're all sold out.  Right?  Because I already fucking busted my nut.  Do you think I'm investing in, you know, to sit there where you would try to get it up  again?  Of course not.  Investing $20.  To sit in some roach fucking hotel with a pig that already jerked me off.  How do I respect anybody that already fucking blew me?  But maybe she wanted to get the fuck out of there too, man. 
[01:20:00]  And that's why she did it in the parking lot.  I don't want to go in this hotel room with this zero.  Oh, that's a good point.  I'm serious.  That's a good point.  She was probably in the same mindset.  You're right, she already got a free burger at the diner.  Yeah, you comedians really know how to treat your women.  Get a burger first at the horrible diner.  Not even the deluxe.  I said, you know what, you didn't give me no pussy.  You don't get to call Slough Fry.  It's always too late at night because their spots are on late.  You're dragging her to some shithole diner at all hours. 
[01:20:30]  It's just horrible.  You guys are a pisser.  It was fun back in the day.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  Girls blowing me in the coat room.  One time this girl watched me jerk off and I swear to God I shot a load through two Dunkin' Donut napkins.  I blasted through two fucking napkins.  That's back in the day.  Back in the day.  Was she impressed?  I don't care.  I was.  I don't give a fuck about her. 
[01:21:00]  Right?  You know, to go through two...  It's like a silencer.  Yeah.  It's like a homemade silencer.  It's like putting a pillow in front of your gun.  Like fucking Don Corleone wrapping it in the towel before he shot that guy in the head.  Went right through, huh?  God, all the pussy.  I remember one time with Norton.  I was begging a maid to fuck Norton.  A maid?  Yeah.  I said, just, yeah, you know, at least look at him or something. 
[01:21:30]  You know, we were on the road together back when, you know, he had no career.  You know, he didn't know how to, you know, brown nose at the time.  And he fucking, I was like trying to get him laid all the time.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was fucking...  Did it work?  No, she fucking grossed down.  I said, just look at his dick.  That's all.  I was begging her.  Oh, shit.  You're trying to sell him.  I was trying to pimp Norton.  Reese W. writes, blowing your load is like hitting the shame button. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, it's over after you do that.  Yeah.  And you do.  You get a little freaky every so often.  Yeah, especially if you've had a couple of drinks and you decide, well, let's do something crazy.  You know?  Yeah.  Get out the razor.  Start shaving things and fucking doing all weird shit.  And then you come and you're like, oh, God.  Oh, God.  Now my crotch is going to be itchy and weak.  I know.  It's fucking going to be chafed.  Did you shave down to nothing? 
[01:22:30]  I'm going to...  One time I did.  It was just so stupid.  Because I was fucking hammered and it was a great idea at the time.  You're all worked up into some horny frenzy.  And you're just like going, meh, meh, meh, meh.  I did it once.  And then I'm like, I look like I'm eight years old.  What the fuck?  Why would you do this?  That's...  No, to keep it nicely trimmed is fine.  You keep it nice, bro.  Yeah, that's it.  When you go...  It just looks ridiculous.  The only time I ever did that is because I had crabs. 
[01:23:00]  That would make perfect sense.  I was eating my girlfriend's pussy once and I saw a crab walking.  I was like...  Really?  Yeah.  Crab walking.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Years ago.  It was a king crab.  It was a king crab.  It was a king crab.  Fucking deadliest catch.  No, I saw this little...  There's a problem.  You saw a little crab like on...  Did she have pubes?  Or was it just like walking?  It wasn't a crab that was lost.  I thought maybe it was just a guy skirting on her labia or something. 
[01:23:30]  So it was clinging onto her hair.  Just cutting through.  It was doing like a high wire act?  No, it was...  I think it walked above, you know, it got out of the hair.  And did it get into like on your face and shit?  No, I looked.  I saw it.  You must have had crabs in your mouth.  Oh, you saw it before you went down.  Yeah, I saw it.  I go, you know, fuck.  And then did you look down at yourself and go like, oh, fuck, I'm infested.  Yeah, I go, no, I got to get that quell, that shit you put in there and the comb.  And then you got to throw the comb out so nobody sees it and knows you had crabs.  You know, go in your bathroom.  The pube comb for crabs.  I had a guy go in my bathroom, when we were doing our last pilot, me and Bonnie, the whole 
[01:24:00]  crew came to our house, right?  So I had to use it.  Like the night before, I had chocolate ice cream, right?  And I'm eating chocolate ice cream.  And then I walk into the bathroom and I put the spoon on the counter, right, without taking  it into the kitchen.  So this guy goes to my room and he sees a fucking spoon with fucking brown ice cream.  And I think he thinks that I fucking clean my ass with a spoon.  I'm sitting there, got to explain to him why there's a brown spoon next to him. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, Jesus.  At that point, it's probably all dried up.  Yeah, he's going, oh man, how much is toilet paper?  No, use a spoon, it's cheaper.  Use a spoon.  Fucking crabs.  Oh, God damn.  That was the worst.  Remember back in the day, did you ever get the clap and you had to go to the clinic back  when you were young?  I can say no.  No, I was lucky, man.  I've never had an experience where I had to get rid of crabs or any communicable diseases 
[01:25:00]  or anything like that.  The shaving thing was just, you know, you get a drunken fucking sex romp going and then  you're just like, oh, what are you, what are you, oh, God.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Pick up and go, oh, fuck.  Aren't we doing Deadliest Snatch?  Yeah, I want to do that.  I still want to do that.  Deadliest Snatch.  Deadliest Snatch.  We just talked about it, actually.  I don't know what the official update is.  Really?  We want girls to come in here and we want, especially Bob Kelly, because he can't stand 
[01:25:30]  smells.  Yeah.  To, you know, to smell and see who has the worst snatch.  And judge who has the worst snatch, but she could actually, you know, make it.  Yeah, see, we want the prize to be so good that women would want to do this and maybe  not shower for a while or do whatever they have to make it horrible.  Don't shower.  Bike ride in here with, like, fucking old panties on.  Right, whatever.  Some kind of yeast infection.  And then vaginosis.  Bobby goes to smell and the fish is smelling back at him. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, it's sticking its head out.  Yeah, bacterial vaginosis.  But I think women would make their snatch dirty on purpose just to win if the prize is  really good.  Rub some shit all over it.  Because no woman is going to, you know, go, ah, you know, I know mine stinks, so I'll  come in for this contest.  I know we're not going to get anyone to do it unless they could dirty it up themselves  for the big prize.  How great would that bit be?  Oh, come on.  We've been trying to do it for a few months.  So, and you just can't get women. 
[01:26:30]  First, you've got to get women listeners.  I mean, yeah, that would help.  We might have to throw just money at it in ourselves.  Well, we have, what, a grand?  We do have a thousand dollars so far?  We have a grand for prize.  That's not bad.  That's a good start.  Some fucking girl wants to win a thousand bucks.  And that dope down in Philly would give us money.  Yeah.  Wouldn't Vagiseal?  Steven Singer.  He would give us money for this.  Dope.  Dolt.  He's our sponsor.  Wouldn't Vagiseal give you money?  Vagiseal?  Vagiseal.  What is that?  Like crazy glue?  Crazy glue.  Fuck.  You can't just see me. 
[01:27:00]  Just have it.  If you can't caulk down at the pussy, you get Vagiseal.  It keeps the water out.  First of all, it's called Vagiseal.  Okay.  Vagiseal.  All right.  That's what happens when they see you naked.  Vagiseal.  Just fuck it.  All right.  So thank you.  Oh, Vagiseal.  That is great.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Just get a homeless woman.  Maybe someone brings in their snatch. 
[01:27:30]  We'll call her Golden Snatch, like the Golden Voice guy, and we can make her a big star for  a week.  Golden Snatch.  Until she, you know, fucks it all up.  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy.  Can we get this done?  I'm talking to the listeners, actually.  You think there's enough women willing to do this?  It would be hilarious.  Ladies?  The concerns that we all kind of share, I suppose, was that no girl's going to want  to come and be humiliated without some kind of kick-assery on the line.  They could be.  Yeah, yeah.  I just don't know if a G is going to do it for ultimate humiliation. 
[01:28:00]  What if they could change their names?  Yeah.  They don't have to be known.  Yeah, well, of course.  They could change their names.  It's all fake names.  Certainly want to get some video because it'll be funny, but we don't have to show their face  to them.  Stank McGillicunty.  Maybe we could do it with, like, bags on their heads or something.  Yeah, that's not even more degrading.  Hey, we're going to smell your stinky pussy.  Put this bag on your head.  At least they could leave the studio without us really knowing who it was.  Yeah, that's great.  I think we could get enough people to do this. 
[01:28:30]  You don't want to hear this, though.  Okay, honey, I'll see you later at home.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Who is that?  You ever fuck a girl and had that white glue stuff fall out?  Yeah, we've talked about that where it's, you know.  It's yeast, right?  No, sometimes it could just be, it could be whatever, vaginal or even your penis discharge.  And from the constant pumping, it's almost like a butter churn, you know?  Oh, Jesus.  It kind of gets a little thick.  Oh, yeah.  Mixing with air. 
[01:29:00]  And then the air almost gives it like a frothy thing.  It's almost like the foam on top of a latte.  When you get a little foam, you're pumping air into all that shit.  Or the foam on a rabbit dog's mouth.  Right, yeah, ravey.  Did you just say a fucking rabies, though?  A rabbit dog's mouth?  A rabbit dog, yeah.  Yeah, that's what you call it.  A rabbit?  Yes.  When a dog has rabies, he's rabbit.  You did say it.  What do you think he is, you fucking idiot?  Rabid.  I just love...  With a D.  I fuck up a lot of things on the show, but I love having you in, because there's no way 
[01:29:30]  I can compete with you.  It's just one letter.  It's just one letter again.  I'm flowers from Algernon or something.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, that makes sense.  You ever read flowers for Algernon?  Well, the key word in that sentence was read.  Ah, that's true.  I used to read a lot, but now I haven't read.  It's a guy that's all fucked up and kind of retarded and shit.  And then they give him some treatment, and he becomes a genius.  And, alas, the treatment is only temporary, and he goes back to being a retard. 
[01:30:00]  That was like a weakness.  You're just like that, without having that genius part in the middle.  I think I am a genius.  Yeah?  Do you really?  Yeah.  It's all relative if you're around fucking turtles.  Why do you think you're a genius?  I'm around turtles, yeah.  Whatever.  Not one woman is saying they would do the contest, so maybe Danny and the boys are right.  I want to do this one, man. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Rub some tuna fish on there.  $1,000?  Whatever.  That's a good money.  And whatever the dope in Philly gives us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guarantee you they're going to end up with a couple grand, some, you know, I'll throw in  a CD or two.  I'll definitely throw in some money on top of whatever we could get from this company,  which is not much, but I'll throw a little at it.  I'll throw a little at it.  No problem.  If we actually do get girls up in this motherfucker, I'll throw in like $500. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  That means I got to throw five.  Yeah.  I was thinking two.  I was thinking two.  But it's another grand, so that's like, that's kind of good.  That's fair.  And we got a couple of thousand.  $2,000.  Now we're up to $2,000.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know when you're going to do this, but give me two weeks in advance because I  can tell Bonnie not to watch her, but do not, okay, $2,000.  And they don't even, they don't have to be naked because that scares off a lot of women  these days.  How are you going to get to it?  I guess they got to be wearing panties or something, you know, but. 
[01:31:30]  A skirt.  They wear a skirt.  What a.  If they want to be naked, that would be awesome.  I know.  But.  I'd rather, yeah.  I'd rather be naked.  But if you, if you say, you know, you have to be naked, I'm telling you, it's going to  drop our numbers.  Yeah, they don't have to, but, but then when we get them in here, we talk.  But they're not, they got panties on, you sniff through the panties.  We're so charming.  Sniff through the panties.  We're fucking disgusting.  We're charming, though.  We could charm those panties right off of them.  Come on.  Certainly we can.  Some of them.  Some of them.  Yeah, yeah.  You can keep your panties.  But they can't be big, fucking, dumb, bloomer, cottony things. 
[01:32:00]  Maybe the listener looks out and they, she has her period and just lets it all just kind  of.  And he, oh, God damn.  But here's the problem with panties, though.  What about these girls that will stink their panties up and their vagina can be as clean  as possible.  That's why.  But they like rub tuna juice on their panties.  That's why judges.  But.  We'll know.  Will we?  How?  If it's like on panties.  That's a good question.  I don't know. 
[01:32:30]  It's got to be like kind of raw.  In the end, if it sounds good for the listeners, I don't give a fuck.  You know something?  Why am I going through it?  See, our job would be, no, that's coming from the snatch, all right.  That's coming from the snatch.  We know it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And then you get Bob Kelly in here.  It's, it's, it's, it's writing itself.  And then.  And then we get.  He'd stop puking.  And then we get to actually do a bit for the first time in two years on our own show.  Oh, my God.  That would be amazing.  That would be completely amazing.  We used to do bits every other day.  What? 
[01:33:00]  Not one girl calling.  Great.  So how else do we, we're up to $2,000 and whatever that, and whatever the dope gives  us in Philly.  $2,000.  $2,000.  I'm here.  $2,000.  And we got a stinky pussy in this motherfucker.  All right.  Line six is a girl and she's from Long Island.  All right.  Kalia.  Kalia.  What's your name?  What's your name?  Kalia.  Kalia?  It's Kalia.  Yeah.  All right.  You sound hot.  No, I thank you.  That means you're not hot.  Fuck.  No, I just, I want to say that I think a lot of girls would do this. 
[01:33:30]  Maybe you just don't have a lot of the female listeners listening right now, but A, in my  opinion, it would be awesome because I'm a huge fan and I would love to come in just  to be able to meet you guys.  Oh, wow.  And plus, if you get $2,000 on top of it, people need money right now.  It is.  So, the only thing is, I think you might have a little bit of trouble with rules because,  all right, for instance, I'm probably one of the cleanest people in the world.  If I would come down and do this, I would get creative.  That's what I'm saying.  We want the girls to get creative. 
[01:34:00]  We don't make that thing stink.  We're not going for natural stink necessarily.  Yeah.  Although, we should have a side prize for naturally.  Natural occurring stench from some type of bacterial infection would be great.  Where you come in and brag, look, I didn't fuck with my pussy at all.  This is how it smells when I wake up in the morning.  I'm at it, boys.  This is organic.  Right.  This is farm grown.  Right.  I probably wouldn't brag about that, but I would do whatever I had to and brag about  what I did to make it smell horrible if I got $2,000 and was able to meet you guys. 
[01:34:30]  Thank you.  You get the bit.  See, I think if women understand that they don't necessarily have an actual smelling pussy  when they're not in this contest, then they would do this.  I mean, you're going to get girls that are, you know, pretty cool and down if they come  in.  You're not going to get somebody who's all fucking uptight and, you know, obviously is  going to be embarrassed.  So, no, I think you could definitely do this.  I would totally do it.  And then we got to go old school.  We used to, who knows with this company, but we used to sell spots in studio for the  bit. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  So, you got rich listeners out there like, I'll fucking sit in and watch the smelliest  pussy contest.  And they're giving up a couple hundred, $500 to be in the studio.  To sit in and watch.  Next thing you know, the prize money goes way the fuck up.  Right.  And that's how we got some of the things done in the past.  You could have.  We sold spots in studio.  Sold tickets.  Special categories.  If I was a rich person and I'm a chick, I would come in to watch that just to see  how embarrassed the girls get, honestly.  And they could.  I think you guys could totally do this.  We could get Halloween masks so we don't even know what. 
[01:35:30]  I wouldn't wear a mask.  I'd let you see me.  I could care less.  Well, you're saying you're in.  Are you in?  I would be in.  Yeah.  Well, then you have your first one.  All you need is.  All right.  We got one.  Hold on a line.  Yeah, hold on.  Because we're actually going to get info.  Fuck it.  We'll get your info and shit.  Fuck this.  We're going to get this ball rolling.  Oh, my God.  I love this kid.  Pat Duffy, everyone.  It's been a while.  What?  How are you, sir?  I'm doing great, guys.  How are you?  Pat Duffy.  Wow.  Did you get that gig or no?  No.  Not yet. 
[01:36:00]  I'm fucked in that sense.  This fucking guy should be doing radio, man.  What's up, Pat?  Not much.  I know my chick will do this.  I just know she's down for it.  She's asleep right now, but I know she'll do this.  I won't even have to ask her.  Contest's over.  If Pat Duffy's girl's involved in this, she's going to win the money.  Yeah.  Because Pat Duffy knows how to play.  He knows how to prep his chick's pussy with some real stink-ass shit.  And Pat, she's more than your girl, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We're actually engaged now. 
[01:36:30]  Congratulations.  And they met on our show.  It's that same girl?  Yep.  Yeah, say, she kicked me in the balls and I asked her to marry me.  Yep.  Wow.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do.  Remember that bit?  They met on the show and now they're getting married.  I wonder how many fucking kids we're responsible for.  Oh, wow.  I think we're responsible for a few at this point.  So she would definitely do it, Pat?  Changing lives.  Oh, absolutely.  I know for a fact she'd be down to do it.  We got two girls already.  That's great.  Can we do it Friday?  What are you doing between 9.30 and 10? 
[01:37:00]  No, I want to do this like next week.  Yep.  I mean, you got all weekend to prepare.  We could do it either Monday or Tuesday.  Let's put it on the fucking couch.  Yes!  We need more chicks.  Can't just have a couple of chicks.  I know my chick is right on the verge of her period, too.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Front runner.  That would be great.  Would she do it without panties so we could get a real good sniff?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  That's fantastic.  Oh, that's fantastic.  That's fantastic. 
[01:37:30]  That's fantastic.  She's certainly a looker there, Pat.  Yes.  Congratulations to you.  Thank you.  And I run into your dad every once in a while in Weird Places.  Really?  Tell him I said hi.  Weird Places.  Weird Places.  Weird Places.  I was in the worst casino in Atlantic City.  The worst.  I don't even remember the name.  And there's Pat Duffy's father walking down the fucking hall.  I'm like, why would you be here?  I had to be here.  There's something that was going on.  Yeah, he told me he recorded you in a hotel room, like a hallway.  Hotel room. 
[01:38:00]  I'm like, you say hallway.  Hey, why don't you talk to Opie about this privately first and see if it should be on the air.  Jesus.  Really?  He did say hallway.  Yeah, he did.  Okay.  He did say hallway.  All right, Pat.  Hold on a line.  We want to make sure we got all your info, because I'm telling you, we want to do this.  We want to do this sooner than later.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I'd love to see you guys again, man.  We'd love to do this.  All right.  Good.  Good talking to you, Pat.  It would be good to see Pat again.  Still the most amazing intern we've ever had. 
[01:38:30]  And he worked for us a little bit, right?  The Duff Meister.  Did he ever get a paycheck?  No.  Stop.  Wait, is this the one that used to do all the crazy stuff?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  It was out of his mind.  He's the guy that he got his face puked on by Pat from Munaki.  Oh, I remember this.  That's how we met him.  Projectile.  Not met him, but that's what made him just a fucking star in the ONA community.  Oh, yeah.  He took the baby bird, man.  That is still a huge video.  That was the first time we met him.  Yeah, he wasn't even an intern yet.  He did that to become an intern.  Oh, that's right. 
[01:39:00]  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  I forgot the story for a second.  People used to do things.  They used to work for...  Yeah, Pat Duffy worked for two years.  We would try to get him hired, and it just never happened.  Yeah.  He literally worked for free for two years.  Not counting a little cashier in there that came out of my fucking pocket.  Whatever, you know.  I just tried to do the right thing, and I don't know.  So his girl's in.  Yeah, that's good.  Okay.  So now...  Bonnie's in, so that's three.  Oh, Jesus.  Didn't you say?  Bonnie's in. 
[01:39:30]  No, he's not in.  Two grand and whatever that dope in Philly fucking gives us.  Jesus.  That's good.  Bonnie's got a nice pussy.  It doesn't stink.  There's nothing you can do to make it stink.  You're fucking up our bitch.  No, I mean, I can't even put stuff on it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  There's nothing you can put on it to make it smell bad.  No.  How about rub it with Limburger cheese?  Yeah, what would be some of the ingredients the women would go for?  Some kind of stinky cheese.  You just rub it in there.  Dog shit.  Dog shit.  Dog shit pussy.  How crazy are you going to get?  Yeah, how crazy can you get?  Like, what else? 
[01:40:00]  Imagine they walk through that door.  It's like, holy shit.  Wow, you pussy stank.  The fish is almost hack at this point.  Yeah.  You want it to be like really something, something really disgusting.  Shit, that fucking liquid that you'd spray on that would smell like shit.  Liquid ass.  Liquid ass.  It smelled like funky, sweaty ass on a construction worker.  Spray that on your bush.  Mm-hmm.  And that would be funny, too, if they just let them grow in a bush and just, their hair's 
[01:40:30]  all matted and stinky.  Oh, that would be great to see.  I think we could get enough people.  Yeah.  I really do, yeah.  How about, like, the juice from the bottom of your garbage pail and just spread your legs  and dump it on it?  Well, that's just what's going to make this great, too, is when women describe it.  Describe how they.  What they did.  What they did.  Like, their formula and how they did it.  What scent are you wearing? 
[01:41:00]  Another girl on line nine.  Oh, nice.  She's got a question, though.  Oh, okay.  Sarah, where are you calling from?  Hi, Jersey.  All right, so you're within the area, so you can certainly get here.  Yeah, totally.  All right, you got some questions.  Yeah, can I keep my tank top on?  Because I don't really like my stomach, but I don't mind taking my pants off.  Oh, my God, yeah.  We'll take that straight anyway.  That's fine.  You'll leave a tank top on?  Yeah, you can hide your bunt. 
[01:41:30]  No problem.  Is that because the shirt's a tank top, or you're shaped like a tank?  Is it a turret?  Do you want to remove your turret?  A little bit of both.  Sorry.  Yeah, no, you can't.  No, that's good.  I mean, technically, you can even leave your panties on, but if you want to be a trooper,  a good sport, we certainly would.  If you're going to leave on the tank top, you might as well ace the panties, you know  what I mean?  That's true.  Get rid of those fucking things. 
[01:42:00]  What kind of concoctions?  Do you have any ideas that we're not thinking of, of a way to maybe stank it up?  Well, I'm on my period now.  Oh.  We all still have it on your day.  Congratulations.  Yes.  Yeah?  I know.  Are you on Facebook so we can take a look at you?  We won't give out your Facebook thing unless you want us to.  But if you want us to just promote it right now, I don't give a fuck.  No, please don't.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  All right, hold on the line for a second.  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on for one second.  I think this is panning out. 
[01:42:30]  Funks29 on Twitter.  Fucking brilliant, man.  Why didn't we think this?  Have the show supply clean panties for the women to wear so they can't cheat.  Oh, that is good.  So now we need a panty sponsor.  Yeah.  That's brilliant, though.  That is good.  Then they can't come in with stinky panties.  And they can't come in with shitty panties either.  Yeah.  We'll have some nice ones.  Although, let me think.  God, if a girl's got a period and doesn't put it in a tampon and her blood, she's got blood  in her panties and just stinks. 
[01:43:00]  She left it there for days.  How great would that be?  That would stink.  Do you think it would stink, the blood?  Oh, yes.  What do you think?  Yes, that's not just blood.  That's like womb lining.  Sarah?  It's disgusting.  Sarah's back.  Sarah.  So, I think we got $2,000, and like I said, that dope in Philly might help us out, too.  Oh, that's awesome.  I love him.  He's great.  I know.  He's great.  He's a great sponsor, that dope.  I love him.  Yeah.  Absolutely love him.  Why are you laughing? 
[01:43:30]  He's a great guy.  I like the whole idea of the whole bit.  Yeah.  That's Sarah.  I mean, you get into a really stink down there.  Yeah.  All right, Sarah.  Sarah on Facebook, huh?  Oh, let me say, let's go to some pictures there.  People want to know maybe a little bit about you.  I could tell the listeners this.  There's a picture of you where you're only showing from your eyes up.  Oh, a little Facebook magic.  You're not that bad.  You look like you've got big titties. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, she's all right.  You've got a tat, right?  You've got a little kitten on your shoulder.  Looks like you're hoping people look at the cat more than you.  Oh.  There's a lot of pictures of you with a cat.  Oh, don't blow it.  That's mean.  You saw you.  There's one pussy we deal with.  Oh.  You're going to rub some used kitty litter on your pussy?  That'd be great.  That'd stink.  I could find some of the harder turds and kind of.  Shove it in there like a tampon. 
[01:44:30]  Do you have giant tits?  You probably should use all the vegetables that you don't eat.  That are rotting.  Oh, man.  You know, those strange leafy things.  She's not that big.  You know, the fruits and vegetables you allow to rot in your kitchen.  Yeah.  You could smear that in all of you.  That fucking slimy black head of lettuce that was never touched. 
[01:45:00]  When you shit out your roast beef.  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  Oh, come on.  We're just fucking with you.  I know.  That's great.  I listen every day.  I'm actually a really big fan.  Yeah.  Oh, we know that.  I like your...  She's not even that big. 
[01:45:30]  What's...  No, she's not.  I'm looking at a picture right now.  She's got nice hair.  She's got nice hair.  She's got nice hair.  She's wearing Harry Potter glasses.  Yes.  Yes.  Very nice.  And you're at...  It looks like you're at a restaurant.  Yes.  And the staff looks worried.  Oh, here comes John Keonis.  What would you do? 
[01:46:00]  No, that's great.  You're just...  You're kind of a big girl, but you're pretty.  I don't think she's big.  She's not like, oh, my God.  No, no, she's not.  She's like...  Let me see another picture.  She's not big at all.  Let's go to another picture.  Let me see the snowboarding one.  The one where she's moving the couch.  Do the one where she's moving the couch.  I'm moving the couch.  What's sitting on it?  No.  I'm looking at the snowboarding one, and you just look...  You got a shape to you.  You know?  You're not, like, fat.  It goes in your hips and then comes out. 
[01:46:30]  It definitely goes in.  Unless that's your snow pants.  Oh, you're not wearing snow pants.  No.  What are...  So you snowboard?  I did once.  Oh, just once?  Yeah.  I don't want to go back, but...  Was there any snow left on the...  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh, that's terrible.  Did people try to snowboard on you?  Oh.  Oh.  See, that looks good.  You're there with your cat.  I like that picture.  It looks like you got a tiny little bra on. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  What is that?  A Star David on your arm?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah?  You got a Star David?  What's wrong with that, Rich?  Nothing.  I like it.  Don't you know the Jewish religion really kind of frowns upon tattoos?  Yeah, I know.  But you don't care.  They also find out people that throw their pussy around for $2,000.  No, they wouldn't.  No.  Oh, that's a deal.  What a bargain.  That would be good.  And the Jewish food is not known...  I think Jews aren't known for good food, so maybe some matzo balls, some gefilte fish. 
[01:47:30]  You could throw some in there.  Oh, I like her tattoo.  How about bitter herbs?  Rub some bitter herbs.  Yeah.  For Passover.  Yeah, for Passover.  Passover, you could pass it over your pussy and make it stink.  You know, I'm thinking maybe the women come in and we take a Brillo pad and kind of scrub  the area.  That's going to hurt.  What?  Well, yeah, that would hurt.  And then...  How about painting an X of lamb's blood on your pussy? 
[01:48:00]  You're going to have...  Trying to keep this all, you know, white school Jewish.  You could have a black girl come in because there's your Brillo pad right there.  Brillo and kind of rub back and forth.  Well, Sarah, I think you're in.  Is that racist?  You're going to do this contest?  Okay.  Yeah, I can do it on Monday.  Yeah, Monday might be...  Monday's a little too short notice, though.  Yeah, we might need...  We're thinking we need a week.  So next week, Wednesday or Thursday would be nice.  Maybe we make a nice big Friday show for everybody.  Yeah, it could be a Friday thing.  Next Friday's rough?  What? 
[01:48:30]  Friday's Car Crash Comedy.  Oh, yeah.  So we might have two bits next week.  We got Car Crash Comedy next week.  We're trying to do bits again.  What about...  Or at least some.  You know, would you be available, I don't even know, in like two weeks?  You don't just don't clean yourself for two weeks.  Well, the best thing about my schedule is I have Monday mornings and Friday mornings off.  Yeah?  So, yeah.  Otherwise, I can...  When do you take off for meeting?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  What do you do for a living? 
[01:49:00]  I do security overnights.  Is your security guard?  Really?  Yeah.  Where?  Really?  Oh, you can't say that.  Do you carry a weapon?  No.  A nightstick?  No.  What do you do?  I sit at a desk.  I'm a fucking waste of life.  I'm an overpayment.  We just broke her down.  I'm sorry, man.  Oh, man.  You just start crying.  You hear the window open. 
[01:49:30]  God damn.  It's like private pile.  What do you...  So you just sit at a desk.  I sit at a desk, and I watch the monitors, the cameras, and I wait for the phone to ring.  Oh.  And if something's going down, you call a policeman or something?  What's the address you gave for the pizza?  Waiting for the phone to ring.  You got it?  Ah, man.  That's the Sarah.  He's going to the bullhorn.  Yeah.  Watch out. 
[01:50:00]  I'm going to the bullhorn.  I'm doing a wacky telephone bit.  Hold on.  These are slow.  He's turning around.  He's going to the trunk.  He's got the bullhorn.  I got the bullhorn out.  Hey, man.  Let me tell you.  I say Sarah has a good shot at winning this thing.  Are we going to try it for next week, or do you want to give it a little time?  I would prefer to do it in two weeks.  Yeah, we should build this up, make it a real big thing.  But like early two weeks, not like two weeks from Friday. 
[01:50:30]  You know what I mean?  Sure.  Like not next week, but the following week's like a Wednesday.  You ever see anything on your cameras or on your monitors where you're like, oh, shit,  I've got to do something?  There was a bear a few months ago, just kind of walking around.  Really?  Yes.  Hello, I'm lost.  Women are mad at the Brillo suggestion.  What?  That bit felt horribly funny.  Oh, don't worry.  Come on, ladies.  It's going to hurt.  I know, I know.  That's what I was getting at.  No, we would never want you to scrub Brillo on your vagina. 
[01:51:00]  It was a major bomb.  You have a boyfriend?  No.  All right.  Why not?  When was the last time you've had any kind of sexual intercourse?  This past weekend.  Oh.  Oh, really?  With just some guy?  Well, he's a friend.  Oh.  Are you like, you know, go out, get some guy and just fuck?  I haven't.  When you go to a bar and you try to get, like, picked up, how late does it take?  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:51:30]  Who's picking up?  When you finally leave, is the sky turning blue?  There are some girls, you know, they're like, ah, fuck, it's only midnight, but what the hell?  And then there's other girls, you know, it's last call, four o'clock, and there's still one.  All right, I'll go to the diner.  Maybe I'll get lucky there.  And then there are the girls that go home with the bouncer because he wants to, you know, be with someone when he's doing his crystal meth.  Does, does fucking, does 4 a.m. Prince Charming kneel down in front of you with a horseshoe and see if it fits? 
[01:52:00]  The, ah, what the hell, I don't want to do this crystal meth alone.  I'm bored.  I could, I, I, I could use that.  Now, be honest, which girl are you?  Yeah.  Um, I usually go home alone.  Oh.  That's sad.  That's really sad.  That is sad.  Good for you, though.  Go to your cat, but your cat is unconditional love, right?  No.  Why?  Because cats suck.  Is your cat dead?  We all know that.  And she doesn't want to play with me all the time.  Yeah, because she's sick of you biting her.  Oh, God.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:52:30]  How old are you?  27.  Oh.  Oh, you don't look 27.  You look young.  Yeah.  You really don't look 27.  I know.  I'm only 4'11", too.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Yeah.  What, pounds?  Why is she staying on the line?  I know.  Sarah, you realize we can't help ourselves, right?  She's very cool.  We are.  We are.  We really can't help ourselves.  We can't help ourselves.  I'm just being quiet and letting you do your thing, guys. 
[01:53:00]  She's a team player.  All right, Sarah.  We're going to have you.  She's a team player and a team.  You rule.  Now, you rule.  4'11".  How much do you weigh?  Um, I think 140.  When you put both legs on the scale?  4'11", 140.  That's only 140?  Well, 4'11".  Jesus.  Yeah, it's the...  Okay.  That's pretty short for a...  I don't think she's that big, though.  No, it's not.  No, no.  She's not like, oh, my...  You know what I'm saying?  She's not like...  You look at her, you go, huh, I'd fuck her. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's a...  If you're at a bar and you sit down and she starts talking to you and she's kind of cool,  you would definitely fucking, you know, do some shots of Jägermeister.  I would stay sitting the entire time at the bar.  So, you know, it's the iceberg effect.  Oh, my God.  With the iceberg where most of it's under the water.  Oh, I got you.  Oh, if she sits down, the top of the bar acts like the surface of the water.  Yeah, man.  Oh. 
[01:54:00]  You ever see an iceberg underwater?  There's a lot more going on.  That's right.  The difference between her and an iceberg is that fucking iceberg.  Oh, no.  You know what?  Here's the deal.  What's your name?  Sarah?  Yeah.  This is all jokes.  It's like, I don't want to read in the paper you did something drastic because I can't  handle the guilt.  Nah, she's fine.  So, from the bottom of my heart, I'm saying you're not a fucking total mess.  Is your middle name Lee?  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:30]  You know, can we bring it all together?  E-Rock, you got a Sarah song for us?  Give us a nice Sarah song.  Sarah, there are some very nice Sarah songs.  What's your favorite Sarah song?  I think Starship is one of the...  Which one do you like, Sarah?  There's Sarah's Smile.  There's Sarah.  There's that other Sarah.  Um, I think the only Sarah song I know is the one that goes, uh, No Time is a Good  Time for Goodbye or something like that.  That's the Starship.  Yeah, we're going to play it.  The Starship.  We're going to bring this together and at least play the Sarah song for you. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  See, this is it.  Yeah, remember this?  This is a fucking popular song.  To keep you all, you know, to keep you all nice and happy.  That's nice.  It's nice, right?  Yeah.  I like it.  It's soothing.  It really is soothing.  And this is like, this song was huge.  I'm sorry, no pun intended.  But this song was, uh...  Massive.  Massive.  Wow. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, remember this?  It's so good to go back in time.  No.  You fucking cunt.  Fuck you.  No.  Right?  You look like a fucking bitch on heat.  And if you get raped by a pack of niggers, it'll be your fault.  Right?  Nice, right?  Bring it together. 
[01:56:00]  Stew is brewing on your stove.  Right?  Right?  You're such a super lady.  I think she's very nice.  Kiss my fat ass!  Oh, no.  Come on.  Terrible. 
[01:56:30]  Holy guacamole.  Yes!  Because when you're sleeping, there's no lonely times.  It's just dreams.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  Oops.  Yeah.  Everybody want to kiss the mic, think it's something right.  Take this finger, you can't ride it.  Do it a bit.  Eat that watermelon, eat that watermelon, eat that watermelon. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Any comments in the book, no?  Because you are a disgusting fat body, Private Pyle.  Oh.  Where is that Private Pyle?  Sir, Jelly Donuts, sir!  No time is a good time for goodbye.  Hey, you little maggot! 
[01:57:30]  You make me want to vomit!  What's your name, fat body?  Nice, right?  It is.  Bringing it together.  Yeah.  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  Turd?  All right.  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook in it.  Sarah's going to be part of the contest. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  No!  Now I think we got three girls, and we got at least two grand.  Code or not?  Four now.  Why?  The other two and Sarah.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  See?  That's what we want.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich, Dr. Pepper, and make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Yeah, for some reason or another, who signed a little cola on radio? 
[01:58:30]  Hee-hee.  Hee-hee.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We know the song.  It's great.  Sarah, stay on the line.  We're going to get your info for the contest.  Stay.  Stay.  Yeah, don't go anywhere.  The big, uh, deadliest snatch contest.  Coming soon.  To the O.B.  The Anthony Show.  She's cool.  Yeah, she's all right.  Don't go anywhere.  Hey, Rich, uh, you're promoting something.  We've got to take a break and get you the fuck out of here.  What do you mean, get me out of here?  What?  What do you mean, get me out of here? 
[01:59:00]  That's never happened in my whole O&A career.  Get me out of here.  It sounds like, I feel like I'm in radio on the road.  Hey, thanks for coming.  Hey.  We want to thank Rich Voss for coming in.  Uh, Rich is going to be at, uh, and that just means get the fuck out of here.  Oh, it's terrible.  It was great seeing you again.  Yeah, yeah.  Great seeing you again.  We're going to get you out of here.  All right.  We, uh, we definitely want to thank Rich Voss for, uh, hey, listen, next time you're in  town.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I want to tell you, anytime you're around, feel free to stop in. 
[01:59:30]  Uh, we're going to take a break and, uh, I want to thank Rich Voss.  Well, the best one.  It's like you'd have no power.  I want to stay.  The best one.  If they want to wrap up, we do it.  Not as much as regular radio guys.  Yeah.  And Rich will be, uh, this weekend.  Yeah.  They just go into your plug and you're like, fuck it.  I thought I was going to do another five or 10 minutes.  You're gone.  That's the worst one.  Like I got to go the night before and you go do radio and you get like five or eight  minutes, you know, and you're like, what?  Yeah.  How is that going to help?  Hey, can you write down five topics you like to talk about? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, that's the fucking worst.  You know, what?  Oh, sorry.  For after the break.  Okay.  For after the break.  I want five things you want to talk about.  I hope you just threw Rich a Sharpie and a piece of paper.  I want to see how this works.  Go ahead.  Huh?  I want to see how this works.  Right.  Right.  Five things, funny man.  Five things you want to talk about during the next segment.  I'm serious.  There's a Sharpie.  You got a piece of paper in front of you.  All right.  I want to see how they do this.  All right.  So, uh, huh?  Like preparing for a radio show. 
[02:00:30]  It's so weird.  All right.  Rich is going to be at, uh, what?  The Funny Farm Comedy Club in Atlanta.  Nice.  This weekend.  Dude, I might be going down for the Masters.  I'm playing.  Oh, really?  You want to go?  Yeah.  I got a guy.  Oh, really?  We can walk the course on Friday.  I'm playing TPC this, uh, Sunday down there.  Oh.  TPC and fucking, uh, Sugar or something in Atlanta.  It's fucking off the hook.  Oh, yo.  Off the hook, yo.  You're going to the Masters?  I have a, I have a connection.  I'm trying to figure it out.  I'm going to walk.  I'm just going to walk around. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Nothing special, but I want to see the course.  No.  Well, they have like, uh, pro-ams and all that crap.  Why don't you get in?  How come you don't get in?  Look, here's a, here's why you're going to work.  I don't want to do any of that.  I just want to walk the course.  They're having, by my house.  Okay.  Wait, hold on real quick.  This weekend, Roswell at the, uh, Funny Farm and next week at the Stress Factory.  Right.  Okay.  In Brunswick.  Everybody.  Atlanta this weekend by Funny Farm.  Yeah.  But listen, in August at the Plainfield Country Club, they're having the Barclays.  Barclays or Barclays?  I, I, I, I corrected.  Barclays. 
[02:01:30]  I know, but Barclays.  They're having the Barclays.  Uh, well, you know something, Travis is going to the wall.  Yeah, I know one thing.  It's not Barclays.  It's not Barclays.  Barclays.  It might be Barclays.  How, can't you get us into the Barclays?  Okay.  Can you get us into Pro-Am on the Tuesday, Wednesday?  I don't want a Pro-Am.  Why?  Why don't you want to do that?  Because it's too stressful.  Why is it fucking cool?  Because you play with guys that really want to win.  And I'm like, I'm not that good.  No, it'd be fucking great.  Are you kidding me?  I just want to play a little fucking golf here and there.  That'd be cool, though.  To play in a Pro-Am?  Playing Pro-Am.  I got to figure out how to get into the fucking Pro-Am.  Dude, you realize that we would be the celebrities and, and, and then regular shows come up 
[02:02:00]  to the golf cart excited.  They're going to play with celebrities and it's me and you.  You know how fucking pathetic that is to that person?  No, it is.  What are you kidding me?  It's happened to us.  Oh, wow.  Who are we going to play with today?  Oh, these guys.  It's like some local fucking weekend weather guy.  It's like, really?  Yeah, but you're bigger than that.  And I was bigger than that.  No, man.  That's what, listen, would you rather play?  You could think you're bigger than that.  I certainly don't.  Would you rather play?  If we're in a Pro-Am and we're the big celebrities, somebody out there is going to be deeply depressed 
[02:02:30]  when they walk up and put their bag on our golf cart.  Would you rather play with you or some fucking third baseman from the Cardinals, you know,  that played, you know?  Dude, it's the Barclays.  They're going to have real celebrities.  Barclays.  No, because it depends on what, it's in Jersey, so it's not, you know.  Oh, yeah, because New York doesn't have a lot of celebrities that could just take a fucking  cab ride.  That's true.  That's a good point.  But what I'm saying is, it's not.  I'm telling you, you don't want to put yourself in the position where you're in the celebrity  category and then people are going to be disappointed.  I don't give a shit if they're, I play, when we played in a tournament in Arizona. 
[02:03:00]  We should not be the celebrities is what I'm saying.  And have them hook us up with real celebrities.  Have us play with them.  How great would that be?  Oh, that would be good.  I want to be the M in the pro-M thing.  You just want to be the M.  I want to be the M guy.  You just want to play with a professional golfer.  Whatever.  But that's a celebrity, a real celebrity.  Yeah, so.  So let's take us out of the celebrity category.  Celebrity, pro-M, you just want to be the M.  We're the M's.  Then it costs tons of money.  Oh, really?  Is that?  Yeah, I think so.  I think when you played in Pebble. 
[02:03:30]  I've been in that situation.  I've seen the look on people's faces and it's not fun.  It stays with you a long fucking time.  No, as a comic, it's great.  You know they spent a shitload of money to play and then they're like, oh, I wonder  who I'm playing with today.  Oh, wait a second.  So in a pro-am.  It's false.  Don't we?  You mean.  Was he on classic comic standing or something?  I'm not really sure.  What the hell was that?  I know him from somewhere.  You never want that.  Do I know you from somewhere?  Yeah.  That's the worst when you walk into a club and the person working the door doesn't know 
[02:04:00]  who you are.  Can you help?  I get so mad.  Look at the poster.  See, right in front of you.  I got that going into my apartment.  I almost got in a fight with my neighbor.  In your own apartment?  Yeah.  He goes, can I help you?  I'm like, are you fucking serious?  You've seen me a million fucking times.  I live right there.  You dope.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  So in a pro-am.  Huh?  Nosy neighbor?  He's not nosy.  No, he was like, why is this guy on the floor?  I should explain myself.  Oh, yeah.  Not a lot of apartments on my floor. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, okay.  And he's like, can I help you?  Like, who do you think I am?  You should have just totally went like, um, what do you mean?  He's a fucking asshole.  What do you mean, help you?  Can I help you?  I would have showed up.  I don't trust the par is my problem, so I know it's partly my fault.  So if we were in a pro-am, you're saying, you and I, say we were the celebrity, we wouldn't  get to play with a golf?  We wouldn't get to play with a pro?  What?  We wouldn't get to play with a pro?  If we're the ams, we get to be with the pros. 
[02:05:00]  Or the celeb.  No, a celebrity goes with a pro, and then you get to, uh...  All right, so we're the other guy.  No, we're fucking...  We're celebrities.  I don't care what you think or not, even though...  Dude, we still get to play golf, and then we get to see real celebrities.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with you?  Because then you've got to pay tons of money, which you have.  I don't.  Someone could be all excited, though.  It's like Rich Ross and fucking O.P.  Yeah, are you kidding me?  That's his fucking ass.  No, he's right.  Yeah.  Man, what, are you kidding me?  This girl can't call and goes, I want to come and meet you. 
[02:05:30]  I'll show you my pussy.  Okay, so you don't think somebody will play golf with you?  My problem is there's going to be real celebrities there.  Listen, I played in these things before.  Who's there?  There's athletes there.  No, but I have the cost.  What?  Oh, how much?  $30,000.  All right, we're the celebrities.  That's for three people.  That's what it costs.  It's only $10,000 each, then.  All right, well, the course is beautiful.  And that means they're going to be even madder when they pay the $30,000, walk up to their 
[02:06:00]  golf cart and see me and you.  It's like, oh, God.  Where you fucking made me another shitty cheese sandwich.  First of all, with a little tiny little cooler with our juice boxes, you fucking weirdo.  I'm not playing golf with you anymore.  I couldn't even have gotten Rick Schroeder, you know, all pissed off.  Jesus, get that loud.  Isn't DJ Jazzy Jeff playing?  Do you know Jay Thomas?  Yeah.  Oh, this is a hookup.  Uh, Ryan. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, what's up?  What's going on?  You're my hookup.  Yep.  Wait, do you have two Twitter accounts?  No.  Okay.  Oh, questioning.  I like that.  A lot of these guys want to answer immediately.  No, I know there's no pro-am down there.  I just want to walk the course.  There's one after, after the Masters they have it.  But then everyone's saying there's nowhere to fucking stay.  After the Masters they let the media play down there.  I'm not doing that.  Are you crazy?  It's a quick in and out.  I got to go see my, uh, my, uh, nephew.  Check out the, uh, uh, uh, check out Augusta and then fly home. 
[02:07:00]  You could play on Monday or Tuesday, right?  I don't want to.  At Augusta.  I don't want to.  What's wrong with you?  They don't want anyone to play on Monday or Tuesday.  It's like the volunteers, the police officers that work and stuff like that.  But, uh.  We probably could get in.  Is there a media too?  Uh, no.  Like, no, there's not.  Hey, do you have any pull?  I'm going to, uh, who is this guy?  It's Ryan.  Ryan, do you have any pull?  How are you doing?  Where's he going to come?  Do you know?  Do you have any pull?  We're going to Monterey in a couple weeks. 
[02:07:30]  Do you have any pull at Pebble?  Uh, yes.  You do?  Yeah.  I've had people golf their, uh.  Did you just cut them off?  Are you crazy?  Hey, email me.  Email me.  Yeah, this is all he's hearing too.  He's not hearing you even say email me.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  We're going to Pebble in a couple weeks.  I hate you.  Why?  Because I just don't like you.  I don't.  Oh, darn.  Darn.  Oh, the guy that doesn't call me back doesn't like me. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, get the hint.  Okay, I don't give a shit, okay?  I'm 53.  I'm not trying to make new friends.  What do you think?  I give a fuck all my whole life.  Really?  The cyst on my kidney's not bothering me.  The fuck that you don't like me doesn't bother me either.  Go fuck yourself, all right?  I'm playing in the goddamn pro-am because I'm a semi-celebrity.  You fucking, no one knows your face.  You fucking idiot.  I've been all over TV.  I still do, Joey Behar.  At least I'm admitting it.  No one wants to say that.  You don't have to admit it.  The public's admitting it. 
[02:08:30]  Okay?  Go fuck yourself, all right?  I don't want you to have to stretch back through next week or in Roswell at the funny farm  this week.  Are you writing down the five things you want to talk about for after the break?  Yeah, we need the five things.  Five things.  Rich is one of my favorite people.  I can't get enough of this fucking guy.  I'm fucking lame.  We used to hit the road together and act like an old married couple.  Just amazing.  I got to take a piss.  Yeah, all right, all right, all right, all right.  Sirius XM, the virus. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, this is the O.P.D. Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Hey, man.  We're hanging with Rich Voss.  We're very fortunate radio people to have Rich in studio.  He's just an amazing comic from New York City.  I see him acting like the local radio guys.  Right.  We're very fortunate to have this very funny comedian in studio.  Very funny young man.  Thanks for having me.  They show you respect, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  They don't beat you down like we do?  No, I take over.  I beat them. 
[02:09:30]  I take over.  This is a whole different ballgame.  Really?  This is the Rich Voss O.P.  And how do you feel when you're...  How do you feel...  Character.  Let me ask you this.  What?  When you leave regular radio on the road, local radio, I should say.  Yeah.  How do you feel?  Like, just real good about yourself and...  Well, I mean, I feel like, you know, I'm going to sell some tickets.  It's going to...  You know, because it usually goes very well.  Uh-huh.  You know?  And I feel like it was fun.  I felt like...  I feel like, hey, I'm still somebody. 
[02:10:00]  And then when I come into this fucking depressing, low self-esteem, everybody just attacks everybody  to take the fucking focus off of themselves.  It's beat him down and make me feel good radio.  Okay?  I love...  A young girl calls in and wants to be involved in a contest where you can't get girls, and  you fucking beat her to the pulp.  Okay?  The defenseless, little pudgy girl calls in to help you, but you beat her down.  Okay? 
[02:10:30]  To build up your self-esteem.  So it's just a difference.  A little bit of a difference.  It's a difference.  But I have my five topics.  How many times have you wanted to quit comedy after doing our show?  I don't...  Here's the thing about your show.  I love comedy.  I was plugging the shit out of you guys on Baltimore Radio.  Everybody always talks about you guys.  It got back to us.  It was amazing.  Huh?  Yeah.  No, it doesn't.  No, I mean, everybody always talks about Opie and Anthony when I'm on the road, you know,  that, you know, where the fuck are they now? 
[02:11:00]  But it's always...  No, but I always talk...  And here's the thing.  This is...  I always say this is the best radio.  Okay?  This runs neck-to-neck with the sports junkies.  So what I'm saying is, this is great radio.  I like those guys, though.  You could have picked them up.  I know.  There's a million shows you could have picked where...  This is great radio.  But the thing is, with this radio, is some of the fans think they're Opie and Anthony.  That's the problem.  Like, you know what?  Like, Wednesday, Monday, I reach a big achievement in my life, whether it sounds corny or not. 
[02:11:30]  I read about that.  25 years sober.  And that's a big achievement.  That makes me an old-timer in AA.  Okay?  I mean, I'm an old-timer in life, but now I'm an old-timer in AA.  What makes it a big deal besides 25 years?  Is it really a thing when you hit 25 years?  Yeah, 25 years, you become an old-timer.  Like, you know what I mean?  They call it that?  Yeah, they call you an old-timer.  Like, you've been around a while.  25 years.  Yeah, and I understand 25 is a long time, but...  To do anything. 
[02:12:00]  Okay?  Okay.  So, you know, and you get...  That's 25 in this fucking business.  What's that?  Nothing.  What did you say?  I'm an old-timer.  Huh?  Radio.  Radio.  14 years.  No.  I did it a while before.  Oh, yeah.  I did it before that, yeah.  You haven't been doing a 25 yet, though.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Because you...  Yeah, you do kind of look like you're getting beaten down.  I don't know if it's a radio or the baby, but you're...  It's the baby.  Holy fuck.  It's not even, like, looking at Opie anymore.  It's like looking at...  Trust me. 
[02:12:30]  I don't want the Opie anymore.  Huh?  The name doesn't...  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, I know.  It's a kid's name.  You know what?  Maybe...  I aged a lot in the last year.  Huh?  That having a kid...  I'm not even going to lie to you.  My eyes didn't go...  What do you call it?  So some of the fans, the ONA fans, and most of them are great.  They come to shows, a lot of them tend, and they get comedy.  ONA fans, like, you know...  Yeah.  Because you guys have the best fucking comics in the country.  Come here.  Come on.  Come on.  Absolutely.  You do.  You really do. 
[02:13:00]  And we were talking about this on radio.  What's that?  We're lucky.  You know, you got Louis C.K. and fucking Colin.  Yes.  The tree.  Colin Kane.  I mean, you have all the biggies.  So, you know...  He's throwing...  He's doing...  What's his name's bit?  Who's bit?  Was it Kevin Nealon?  Who's Kevin...  Oh, really?  I listened?  Who's Kevin Nealon?  He was in here.  Doesn't Kevin Nealon do that fucking...  That little fucking jabbing?  Subliminal shit?  No, Wendy Lehman does it.  Okay?  Oh, really?  Oh, really? 
[02:13:30]  Kevin Nealon's just out and out funny.  I remember doing XM with him.  He was so fucking funny that day.  Anyhow, so you have the best comics.  Where am I going with this?  But a lot of your audience thinks they're O.P.  or thinks they're Norton.  Thinks they're funny.  Didn't you write down five things?  Yes, I did write down five things.  Just trying to keep you on track.  Here's my five subjects.  All right.  Kids, pirates, sobriety, golf, and eBay.  I always put golf on the road because this is where I get my plugs in. 
[02:14:00]  And you get free golf.  I get free golf.  Because all of a sudden someone goes, oh my God, I fucking got an in at this country club.  All the time.  You're willing to deal in consulate.  We're actually not supposed to talk about the list on the air.  You'd say something like, you know, O.P., obviously, you know, wow, having a kid must  be rough.  Rich, you got kids, right?  Rich, Rich, you got kids.  Oh my God.  That's it.  Can I not ship at night?  You got kids, Rich? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, we were just talking about how O.P.  It's just talking about how difficult it is, especially that first year of having a...  I've aged a lot in it.  Rich, you actually have kids, don't you?  It's like this, though.  Rich, you got kids.  You got kids, right?  That's like the question.  Like you're not really sure.  Yeah, meanwhile, it's like giant Sharpie letters.  Kids.  Kids.  I want to talk about this.  Talk about my kids.  Oh, God.  So I think you got some right there, Rich.  Oh, mine are grown up now.  I mean, well, I got a baby, but I got the two older daughters. 
[02:15:00]  Your kid's not a baby anymore.  She's like seven, I think.  She's three.  Oh.  She's three.  His girlfriend's seven.  You're mixing them up.  She's three.  I thought you were...  That's funny.  You guys are three, 22...  20, 18, and three.  Oh, man.  My ex-wife moved yesterday.  They were two miles from me.  Whoa, I don't know what to do with this, because it's not on the list.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  What's he doing?  Are you crazy?  We'll be right back after this.  Rich, stick to the list. 
[02:15:30]  Jesus.  What's he going to do?  Don't you see our pie chart?  In two minutes, we've got to do weather.  We've got to squeeze in the kids, the eBay, the pirates, the sobriety, and golf.  Oh, my God.  What a horrible list of five, man.  Jesus.  Early in the morning, it's bright and early.  You've got shit in your eyes, and you've got to write down pirates.  I know why, but it just looks stupid on paper.  I don't want to talk about pirates.  I was going through the paper this morning, and God, that's a shame about those Americans 
[02:16:00]  that were killed on that boat from the pirates.  Oh, right.  You hear about that, Rich?  Yeah.  I hear about it.  What?  Are you kidding me?  You like pirates, right, Rich?  You like pirates.  You like pirates.  Let's sound natural, but it's so awkward.  Yeah.  Everyone knows what's going on in the room and have the listeners.  You a fan of the pirates?  Thinking it's the Pittsburgh pirates, it's actually the Somalian pirates?  Well, I heard.  How old are your kids, really?  Okay, we'll get back to the pirates in a second. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, 2018 and three.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, you said that, but then we were going to do some real shit, so, okay.  Oh, your ex moved.  Who cares?  I do.  She was two miles from me.  She is real close to Rich State.  Two of our babysitters are gone, my ex-wife and my 20-year-old.  Oh, where'd she move?  Like far?  North Carolina.  She moved, moved.  Yes.  I thought she moved to the next town.  Like the rest of the white trash.  No, she had a big house.  The rest of the white trash.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  I'd never met your ex.  Was she nice?  Yeah, very nice.  She's all right.  You know, she's fun.  No, no.  No, not actually, but still have a little feeling for her.  No, but I was talking.  One time, Bonnie, we were in a baby's room, and Bonnie was ironing, which I don't know  why she was ironing, and I was on the phone.  She learned it from you.  I was on the phone with my ex-wife.  Right.  So she's ironing, and she knows I'm talking to my ex-wife, and my ex-wife hangs up, and  she doesn't know it, and I still be talking.  I go, all right, I love you. 
[02:17:30]  I'll talk to you later.  You said to your ex-wife.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you did it to fuck with Bonnie.  Oh, yeah.  You're an asshole.  What did Bonnie do?  She almost dropped the iron.  Why did she move to North Carolina?  Everyone wants to move there.  What's that?  Why did she move there?  Better weather, less property taxes.  It's fucking nice down there, man.  The fucking houses.  You can get, like, a mansion for, like, nothing.  I wouldn't move in a second.  I know. 
[02:18:00]  The problem is you've got family around.  I don't care.  You didn't have that pesky family shit.  There's some great places to live.  But then you have to say goodbye to them forever.  Oh, fuck them.  I'd leave in a second if it wasn't for, like, the fact that everything is here.  If the show business was out of fucking North Carolina, I'd move.  You could get a house for nothing.  Well, most people don't move because they're tied down with family.  And if they have the kids, and the kids have the school they like.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Like, you're stuck.  There's great places to live that will never happen.  Yeah, that you could fucking not have to worry about.  You'd get way more for your money, like Ann was saying.  Yeah.  You don't have to worry about pirates attacking you, walking from your car to your house.  You could look for a house on eBay.  Yeah.  They have houses on eBay?  It's your list, you asshole.  Oh, but not for houses.  Oh, sorry.  We got a good deal.  I'm sinking into the next fucking topic.  Oh, yeah, eBay.  I was on eBay the other night.  Oh, I was going to go pirates. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, you want to go pirates still?  Well, we were kind of talking about pirates.  Well, you're done with the ex-wife moving to North Carolina?  Yeah, but you know these pirates, and I heard, this is what I, you know, my wife reminds me of a pirate.  She takes my kids and just moves.  You know what I heard?  Pirates do that.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  I really don't want to move on yet.  So your ex moves to North Carolina.  Yes.  Your daughters have to be bummed out.  That's their mom.  Well, first of all, my 18-year-old's already in school in North Carolina. 
[02:19:30]  She's already down.  Oh.  So that's going to help us in a year with her tuition.  That's where it's going to help me because she'll become a resident.  So it'll be like, you know, cutting costs.  Now, my 20-year-old is flipping out that she's got to leave all her friends.  Wait, the daughters are moving?  Listen to me, fucking low attention span.  I just said it, you fucking, your mind's on fucking faggot cereal.  Well, my 18 or whatever, my 18-year-old's already down in school there. 
[02:20:00]  Right.  My 20-year-old's having a tough time moving down with her.  Gotcha.  Okay.  I thought you were the strong parent and they would stay with you.  I would have my daughter stay with me.  I have no room.  Gotcha.  I have two bedrooms.  I'm sorry.  I use one and the three-year-old uses the other.  I can't have the three-year-old sleep in the living room because she's three years old.  If I had another room, my daughter would move in with us.  Gotcha.  If I could get Bonnie out, I would have my 20-year-old in and I would sleep in the living room. 
[02:20:30]  He has thought this through.  He really has.  But in the end, he couldn't figure it out.  Yeah.  So goodbye to the daughter.  So I should, that's got to be bumming you out of it.  Yeah, it's kind of depressing.  Yeah.  How often do you think you're going to see them now?  Huh?  They're old enough that they should just stay in Jersey where they're comfortable.  One is already in school.  I know all that.  Okay, so the 20-year-old.  But the 20-year-old's old enough that she doesn't have to move in with mommy anymore.  I know, but all the sudden.  I was long gone at 18.  Huh?  Ann was long gone at 18.  Yeah, because you guys come from broken down. 
[02:21:00]  You couldn't wait to get out.  Oh.  I was gone at 18, too.  I got the fuck out.  What do you think?  Your home was fucking wonderful?  They come from a broken home?  No, but they come from a good home.  No, they don't.  I never made my kids take a shower together with me and sing songs.  The girls.  I had to build a tree house where my kids would get raped in.  All right?  So go fuck yourself.  Just pull in vagaries.  You're out of the sky.  I know. 
[02:21:30]  It's great.  Okay.  Vagary.  Little things he's picked up on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  They've not become...  A fake farm.  What I'm saying is...  It wasn't a fake farm in his case.  You grew...  In my case, it was a fake farm.  Yeah.  The whole backyard had to be best friends.  So we could save, what?  20 bucks a month?  On taxes?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, and probably taxes.  That's what it was.  My kids come from...  My kids never saw me on drugs.  I was sober before they were born.  Oh.  25 years, remember?  Yeah, 25 years on Monday. 
[02:22:00]  Did that take care of the sobriety thing?  Or we got...  But you know what made me happy?  What happened?  That Ann even saw it on Twitter.  That means he followed me.  I did.  Look at that.  I have some good Twitters.  I see your Twitters.  They're called...  I know.  That's if you're in the cult.  If you're on the outside of the cult, you call them Twitters.  Okay?  You're fucking culted.  All right.  All right.  Culted.  In a way, that makes sense.  I can't...  I had an argument the other day who tweets more, you or cowhead.  I don't...  I go through stages.  Yeah.  Because I save my tweets knowing there's going to be a day where I'm going to tweet a lot. 
[02:22:30]  And I'm tweeting more because I'm stuck at home.  I burn that tweet.  I can't get the fuck out.  That's your communication with the world, isn't it?  I'm babysitting my kid every day.  Why don't you get one of those?  You're in New York.  Just like a million Jamaicans.  I don't trust them.  Haitian or whatever.  I don't trust them.  Haitian.  Yeah.  You don't want...  I want family, man.  I don't trust them.  I know what you're talking about.  And I'm sure there's a few out there.  But there's stories in the paper every fucking day.  Once they get older, you start loosening up.  Like, we'll go on the road and just call the hotel for a babysitter. 
[02:23:00]  At least I want my kid to be able to talk.  So, you know, if some shit's going down, he'll be able to hopefully communicate.  When I was in Montreal...  Listen, here's a fucking nightmare babysitting story.  When I was in Montreal two years ago, you know, we're backstage.  We're doing a...  We're doing...  Is that the girl coming in?  No, it's Roseanne.  Oh.  In a bathing suit.  Oh, what's she doing?  I am listening to you.  No, it doesn't matter.  Your fan is.  We were... 
[02:23:30]  I was in Montreal two years ago.  And, you know, the craft service girl in the dressing room, you know, doesn't...  All the food was, like, rotten by the end of the week.  And I was trashing the food, whatever.  So the girl cried.  Okay, enough.  She started crying.  And this is the craft girl.  Really?  So you're crying.  So that was...  So the following year, I'm in Montreal again.  I'm talking to...  We need a babysitter for a Friday night.  So the craft girl this year goes, oh, I have a friend.  You know, and then we called whatever, an office. 
[02:24:00]  And we talked to people.  Next thing you know, the knock on the door opens up.  And it's a girl I made cry from two years ago.  Did she remember?  Yes.  We looked at each other.  I go, what...  Did you babysit the kid?  You ass.  Well, we had no choice.  Oh, man.  I just...  I just smacked the kid around.  Fucking your father's an asshole.  Babysitters.  You're taking chances, dude.  It's tough, man.  Fuck that, man.  You know, you can't... 
[02:24:30]  You know, here's the thing, too.  If you get a babysitter and something happens, you know, like, what the fuck?  But who do you...  Something could happen with a first cousin or an aunt or anybody.  I understand that.  You know what I mean?  So it's creepy.  There's probably family members I wouldn't allow.  Yeah.  To babysit.  Roll the dice.  But some, like...  Who is it going to be?  You have an interview with some big, huge Jamaican black woman, and all of a sudden you're like,  all right, yeah.  No.  You need, like, Mrs. Doubtfire.  I don't know, because they're weirdos, too. 
[02:25:00]  You know what's even the weirdest?  When you go to a preschool or a daycare, and there's a guy working there?  Dude, I...  That's creepy.  Yes, you're absolutely right.  And I'll tell you something else that I haven't brought up in this show.  When I walk my kid around Manhattan, you so see how many fucking creeps are walking around.  Holy shit.  Your eyes are wide open, and you see stuff, you're like, holy shit, that guy is a fucking creep.  Yeah, don't...  What do you mean?  I never noticed this before.  Don't come up...  Well, I do the dumb thing where the kid's on my chest in, like, whatever they're called. 
[02:25:30]  You know what I mean?  Backwards papoose.  Yeah, so he's looking out, I'm looking out, and you pass people on the sidewalk, and the  looks they give the kid, you're like, holy shit, that is a fucking kid toucher.  Sometimes it's just a cute kid, so you just go like, aw, yeah.  I could go to the phones right now, and these fucking parents know what I'm talking about.  Your eyes are open to so much different shit.  You're like, that guy that just walked by and checked out the kid is a kid toucher.  There's no doubt in your soul.  Really? 
[02:26:00]  Dude, and there's way more than you realize.  Way more than you realize.  I'm telling you, I'm not even fucking going for the bit.  You know what?  I mean, you can make it into a bit, but I'm telling you, you see some shit that you never  saw before you had a kid.  Well, the worst, the worst, the kid, they'll come up to you and they'll touch your kid.  Like, my kid's not a dog, don't fucking pat my kid.  Yeah, you don't want to touch him.  You know, or the worst, you take them into somewhere, and I said, they'll go to give  your kid, like, a lollipop.  I go, whoa, whoa.  The first thing you teach your kid is not to take fucking things from strangers. 
[02:26:30]  I'm, the parent is right here.  Give it to me, and I'll give it to the kid if I want to.  Like, we were in the store the other day.  I swear to God, we're in the store, and my daughter's yelling, I want, in the post office.  I want a lollipop.  I want a lollipop, right?  In the post office?  In the post office.  She just goes, take me, I want to go get a lollipop.  I want a lollipop.  So maybe they're selling lollipops.  That's a code word for, and he has to go, I want a, so I go, you're not getting a  lollipop.  I have one at home.  We walk out in the parking lot.  Some lady goes, oh, I got a lollipop in my car.  No, no, thank you, man. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, one that's been in your fucking car.  Two ladies offer me lollipops.  But in all fairness, you also see people just being nice.  Yeah, I know.  Nice people are idiots.  But you do see, look, the phone's lit, and I don't have to go, but you see that.  Yeah.  Your eyes are open, and you realize, oh, my fuck.  And it's people you see in the neighborhood.  You're like, oh, that guy?  Really?  I always assumed it was like, you know, when you see a puppy or something, it's like, oh,  that's cute.  So you see a kid, it's like, oh.  No, you get that.  Never.  You get that, and you know the difference. 
[02:27:30]  I can't explain it.  It's a feeling, and you're like, wow.  I don't know.  I don't see.  I'm not the kind of guy.  And male babysitters?  What the fuck is that about?  You ain't getting any of those.  What is a male babysitter all about?  Don't two-knuckle a kid in a fucking second.  Don't two-knuckle a kid in a fucking second.  Yes, a male babysitter.  Stop it.  Just go out and get a real job, you fruit.  What are you doing?  You're the worst.  Cam counselors, anything with kids.  Yeah, yeah, anything with kids.  There's certain jobs men.  There's exceptions. 
[02:28:00]  There's exceptions, certainly.  But in general, no fucking way, man.  I'm suspect of any guy that spends his hobby time with kids in any capacity.  I'm even talking your soccer coaches.  Boy scouts.  Boy scouts, things like that.  I'm suspect of every single one of them.  Well, the coaches are usually...  Sorry guys out there.  The coaches, it's because the sun is on the team.  Well, how about the guy coach that coaches the girls' soccer team?  Yeah.  That's a guy that's smart. 
[02:28:30]  Oh.  No, I mean like not a high school soccer team.  Okay, I'm talking like, you know, eight-year-olds running around kicking each other and what?  But you know what that's about.  We're all going out for pizza.  Hey, everybody.  Come on, girls.  Pile on top.  I still say a guy that decides to become a gynecologist could be the smartest man in the world.  Well...  And then they'll downplay it because they know their wives are listening.  Look, we look at Dirty Snatch 2 and Old Snatch.  It's not a crime what he's doing. 
[02:29:00]  I'm talking about these guys that are around fucking kids.  Well, I was leaning toward, you know, when you got girls like leaning over with skirts  playing field hockey, why wouldn't you want to be the fucking male coach?  Because that's pedophilia.  Well, no.  High school.  No.  Pedophilia is when you start doing something about it.  No.  You could be pedoing.  Oh, really?  Oh, I'm just a peeping Tom.  If it's elementary school, it's terrible.  Oh, thank you.  Like, junior high, you start looking, seeing who's going to be hot. 
[02:29:30]  Junior high.  He went from voice of reason to creep again.  And then high school, you know.  Hold on.  Junior high is a gray area.  Let's just...  A gray area.  You could start telling who's going to shape up.  That's like the fucking...  Yeah.  That's when you're...  When I'm at...  It's like...  I remember being at my daughter's basketball game.  Yeah.  Right?  I'm watching the game and I lean over to the guy and go,  Hey, is that one seeing anybody?  That's good. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Something to do with guys.  Anytime a guy's involved with kids in any way, it's creepy.  It's creepy.  It is.  You know.  It's like, why would you do that?  Like, there's other shit you could be spending that time doing,  but he likes doing it so much.  Why?  Why wouldn't you want to be the high school coach for the field hockey team?  High school you would.  Well, field hockey don't say in high school.  I'm talking about the guys that are fucking, you know,  taking the kids in the SUV and they're like eight years old from the soccer game. 
[02:30:30]  And it's like, what's this guy doing?  You know, they're all playing that they're not the last one to be dropped off.  No, no.  You can take me now.  Yeah.  Why don't you sit up here?  You can sit up here.  There's no one else left.  I mean, you might as well, you know.  So, good job today, you patter on the leg.  Good job today.  You really hustled out there.  And then you don't remove your hand on the last pad.  Do you want to help drive?  Yeah.  Come here.  Yeah.  Why don't you come here?  Come here.  Oh, how creepy. 
[02:31:00]  Don't move your hand.  And then you just turn around with your digital camera.  Smile.  Oh, you just start taking pictures of her.  Oh, God.  Dropping her off last is totally out of the way.  Like, even the kids are questioning, like, she was one stop from the soccer field.  High school coach that has the pool party.  Smart or perv?  Brilliant.  Brilliant?  High school, brilliant.  Brilliant?  I'll never diss the high school thing.  Junior high, pool party. 
[02:31:30]  Again, again.  We'll call it the gray area.  You're looking at the minor leagues and seeing who's got the arm.  Who's shaping up?  Who's going to go to the majors?  High school's even creepier.  High school's not creepy.  I remember.  Yes, it is.  No, it isn't.  Did you ever coach?  Not to do shit, yeah, but to look and say, wow, that girl's fucking attractive.  It's basic human nature.  No, and to look at a high school girl and go, some day she'll be very attractive.  To look at a high school girl and go, wow.  And say she's hot?  No, no, you're lying. 
[02:32:00]  It's basic human nature to look at something attractive and go, like, wow, she's pretty.  There's kids that are seven-year-old.  There's seven that, you could tell when they get older, could be a model.  Well, then you'd say, wow, that girl will probably be hot when she gets older.  But in high school, they're already cooked.  You go like, all right, that girl is hot.  That's it.  And then once they grab that diploma, it's all downhill from there.  Oh, the second they throw that cap in the air, fucking time starts ticking. 
[02:32:30]  You start throwing your cap around.  Talk, tick, talk.  Oh, God.  We're veering off my list.  Oh, really?  We're kind of on...  We're on kids.  We're on kids.  Kids and touching.  It would never happen on the road.  Seventeen's legal in New York for anybody.  It knows.  Yeah, I go through all the laws.  Yeah.  What are parents...  Dakota Fanning, not even a funny kid-toucher joke anymore. 
[02:33:00]  She's 18 today?  I don't know how old she is.  Well, the girl you're seeing is...  The girl that comes in the studio, I don't know if you're still seeing her.  Seventeen today.  She's as good-looking as anything on the planet.  She's beautiful.  And she follows all the comics on Twitter from...  She doesn't follow me, though, but all the other comics.  So I'm not a big fan of hers anymore.  You can tell me.  You know what?  I'm sure she'll follow you now.  I mean, she's following everybody else, you know?  Do you tweet too much? 
[02:33:30]  No, I barely do it once or twice.  Maybe three times a week, four times a week, five.  All right.  I'm not a big one.  We'll have to remedy that.  You know, I had a good one a couple weeks ago.  Did you?  Yeah.  It's not just plugs?  No, no.  I said, I hate all of you except one person, so you can't erase me because you might be that  one person.  Oh, that's good.  That's where you use that element of doubt.  It's like the one blank in the shooting when they have a fucking firing squad.  No, I barely plug on Twitter. 
[02:34:00]  Well, you should, though.  I do once in a while, yeah.  I mean, it just doesn't want you plugging too much.  Here's the thing.  I mean, it's really smart for marketing.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  I have 11,000 people following me, so that's one quarter of a person in every market I go  to.  I mean, if you don't have fucking five million people following you.  If they're all right around the club you're going to, you're golden.  Roswell, Atlanta, this weekend.  Yeah.  Where are you going to be again?  From there?  Wow.  At the funny farm in Roswell. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, let me take this phone call because all the parents are trying to get in.  Got Tom in Connecticut.  Tom.  Hey there, Tom.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I totally, totally agree with you on the freaky, skeevy scumbags that check out your kid  when you're at the park, man.  I took my daughter to the park when she was two years old, and there's just a guy sitting  on a bench.  He's sitting there, just nothing.  And like 20 minutes after the air, he just left.  Yeah, but how do you know that they...  No, Rich. 
[02:35:00]  I know.  I can't believe you're not on board with this one.  No, I am.  I am.  You just see things so differently when you're walking around with your kid.  You know what the worst is when you're at the park with your kid after you just got  divorced, and you look to see who has rings on their hand to see the other divorced parent  that's there.  And it's so depressing because sometimes you'll see a family, then you'll just see the single  dad that gets his kid on the weekend, and he takes him to the park.  It's a sad, sad, sad day.  Uh, okay. 
[02:35:30]  I'm just saying, I went through that.  Someone asked, do you notice the people that hate kids, too?  Because that comes up.  Oh, what do they go like that?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  They make an ugh face?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They let you do a slam on your kid?  Yeah, they look at it like, ugh, I hate fucking kids, and your kid better not, you know,  pipe up or do anything.  But we make sure our kid doesn't pipe up.  Here's the question.  You're on a plane.  We haven't done that yet.  I'm a little too scared.  Okay, but no, you're not with your kid.  You're on a plane.  I'm not scared.  I'm just, I don't want it to be a scene.  No, no.  I don't want to be that guy that has a kid with a scene. 
[02:36:00]  You're on a plane by yourself.  Right.  And you hear a, not you, because you don't have a kid.  You hear a kid screaming and crying, and do you get mad, or do you go, well, I understand.  Ridiculously mad.  Because it's not my kid.  Yeah.  But you understand, though, don't you?  No.  I mean, you're going, I have a kid.  I can see it happening.  No, we've done our kids on plane stories over the years.  Like, all I ask, honestly, in the end, is you try.  But a lot of parents don't even try, because they're like, ah, he's going to cry, what  can I do?  Of course you try.  The kid, he's on a plane, his ears hurt. 
[02:36:30]  They don't even try.  One stupid, should we tell the story in first class again?  Where this kid's screaming bloody murder, because he wants candy.  It's a long fucking flight.  I forgot where we were going.  It was when we were flying a lot.  The mother decided at that moment she needed to teach the kid a lesson and not give him the  candy.  So guess what happened for the next two hours?  And we're all sitting there going, give the fucking kid the candy and figure it out later.  But she's like, nope, you're not getting the candy.  I don't care how, she's basically saying, I don't care how much you scream.  I don't care. 
[02:37:00]  In first class?  Everyone else did.  Yeah, when I see a kid sitting in first class, it bugs the fuck out of me.  Because it's like, you know, you pay premium price to do that.  So do you make your day go to coach?  I don't care.  Get in the back.  Why?  So you're paying premium, right?  Yeah, you're paying a good price to be up there and not have to deal with certain problems.  And I don't want fucking kids in first class.  If they're quiet and I don't even know they're there, then I don't give a shit. 
[02:37:30]  But once they start crying, boo.  We had our daughter in first class, she was perfect.  Because we all got bummed.  I was sitting in first class once.  I'm not bullshitting.  And the guy next to me, he's sitting next to me.  And I do this at home.  I talked about it last time.  Had his sneakers or shoes and socks off.  And he was picking his toenails.  I look at him.  What the fuck are you doing?  I go, I turn to him.  Because I don't let anything slide off.  I go, are you fucking for real?  Are you really going to do this next to me? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  You're fucking not even from a third world country.  You fucking, you're an animal.  Put your socks on.  Savage.  I was in a fucking restaurant recently.  And I'm at the counter.  And the guy next to me is blowing his nose.  I go, are you fucking for real?  I'm eating.  I mean, he wasn't a big black dude.  He was just a regular average white guy.  Well, yeah.  So easier to yell at.  But that doesn't fucking drive you nuts if you're sitting there eating and some guy's  blowing their nose in a restaurant.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to the bathroom.  Do it there.  Whatever the fuck you need.  People are just inconsiderate dummies.  They're dumb.  People are fucking dumb. 
[02:38:30]  They have no social skills.  They're selfish as fuck.  They don't know what to do when they're out and amongst other people to not annoy the  piss out of them.  How do you fucking sit in a restaurant where people are eating, blowing your fucking nose?  Go to the bathroom.  There's a fucking bathroom in the place.  Yeah, and the fucking fat people.  I saw a guy at the salad bar where you could take it to go.  You must have made fucking five plates to go, you fat.  If you ever wonder why you're a fucking hemoglobin. 
[02:39:00]  Hemoglobin.  He's blood.  I can't even put it on the list.  It's already there.  Hemoglobin.  You see how long your list is, by the way.  It's exaggerated.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  It goes down half the door and then there's four columns.  Hemoglobin.  Of words that Rich is mispronounced.  Yeah, fucking people.  In first class, I'm flying first.  I get bumped up tomorrow.  I already got bumped up.  It's only a short flight in Atlanta. 
[02:39:30]  But when I fly to Seattle, I'm in first.  Yeah, you got it one long time.  And I get aggravated if I'm not in first.  I'm in coach.  Sometimes I don't get bumped up.  And just the fact that they sit next to me.  Okay, here's your space.  Here's mine.  I've almost said to people, see, there's a glass wall.  None of you should hang.  Not one piece of you in my space.  In my space.  I pay for this.  Because I'm making a concerted effort to not do it to your fucking seat.  And I think about things like that. 
[02:40:00]  It's like, we're fucking assholes.  When I'm driving, if I see fucking headlights really coming up on me and shit, I'll put my  blink around.  I'll look.  I'll put my blink around and get out of the way.  I actually scan my mirrors so I don't make a fucking parade behind me when no one is  in front of me.  And the people, and you pass them, and I look and go, that figures.  Every time I go, that figures.  Because you know what?  They really are the worst drivers in the world.  It's a stereotype.  And I'm not even going to say the race. 
[02:40:30]  I'm not going to say it.  I'm writing me.  They are absolutely the worst fucking drivers in the world.  Let's see if we have a match.  Well, okay, I already have it written down.  It's the second one.  No.  Not pirates.  No, that's like second worst.  Oh, you're talking about...  I'm talking your typical everyone knows.  Dude, every time I'm on the road and someone's doing something fucking ridiculously stupid,  not just a little stupid, ridiculously stupid, I will turn my head... 
[02:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I'll turn my head and go, yep, there it is.  And then I blurt out the epithet to myself in my truck, and I pass him, and then I cut  the fuck in right in on him.  And then I take my driver's side wheels, and I go right into the shoulder and kick rocks  and sand up on their windshield.  That's the best move.  And yell, of course it's another David.  Or something like that.  Thank you.  No one tries me fucking nuts.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:41:30]  From...  It's from...  It really works when you have to explain your joke.  I got to do it all the time.  You know what...  You're doing crickets.  I just...  No, it's not.  This is what gets me...  Think?  Yes?  No, because people now are thinking it's Jewish people.  No, no, no, no.  They're not bad drivers.  Remember...  Yes, why am I doing this to myself?  I'm just making it...  Okay, when you hit your golf ball on the side of a hill, what's it on?  See, that's way better. 
[02:42:00]  When there's a weakness in your armor.  Dude, I...  Okay, when...  This joke, by the way, is so bad that I just did.  Wow.  And I can't even explain it because then I give away Ann's fucking secret.  I can't tell you how bad this is right now.  When those little cheese crackers, what are they called?  See, that's way better. 
[02:42:30]  Way the fuck better.  No one else drives me fucking nuts when I'm sitting in first class and someone puts their  fucking luggage above one of our seats and then walks back to coach.  It's like...  Like, really?  That's not your fucking seat?  No.  No.  You don't have luggage privileges above me?  Yeah.  Kind of smart, though.  Yeah, because they want to get it as they're leaving and they make sure that there's space.  Kind of smart.  Kind of smart.  Another thing is, don't bring a fucking suitcase on the plane that's too fucking big, you lazy 
[02:43:00]  fuck.  You're fucking holding up the whole plane.  You're trying to fit it in.  Okay?  You're like...  Oh, I...  Well, that's why you gotta have your carry-on has to be the proper dimensions.  Yes.  Thank you.  Or else don't bring it on the fucking plane asshole.  Thank you, TSA.  Are you doing your airplane material?  No, I switched on.  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't on the list.  Airplane.  No.  We're a little off.  That's not my airplane material.  I get better airplane material.  Yeah.  Why waste your good stuff on this show, right?  My new airplane bit?  Yeah.  It's a couple months old.  Oh, okay.  It's a couple months old.  I go...  And this is true.  When the plane landed, and it hit me... 
[02:43:30]  The flight attendant said, if you're waiting for a wheelchair, please stay in your seat and wait  for assistance.  And I go, opposed to what?  I'm falling in the aisle and laying there like a human speed bump.  If you're waiting for a wheelchair, please don't sign up for the Taekwondo tournament  and quit being a burden on your family.  It's kind of funny in the moment.  It's not a bad little bit.  I like it.  A little...  Hey, let's go to a sketch.  A sketch.  All of a sudden, he turns into Brian Regan on radio. 
[02:44:00]  Do the donuts.  Before we get to the next topic on your list, we got Ray in Tennessee.  You can call me Ray.  Oh, Ray.  What's up, Ray?  Hey.  When I was deployed to Afghanistan this past November, I was reading in the Stars and Stripes,  the Army magazine, whatever.  And there was an Air Force guy out in Germany that he was babysitting family's kids.  And how he would...  He ended up molesting like seven little girls. 
[02:44:30]  Jeez.  But what he was doing...  Way to keep it fun.  Jesus.  He would go up to these families or whatnot, and he would be like, yeah, I have a lot of  problems.  It's really hard being in the...  I don't want to hear that.  Meh.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  You cut the guy off.  I don't want to...  Eh, sometimes you just hang up now.  Oh.  Yeah, but it's a lot easier.  Trying to keep it fun today.  Yeah, that is kind of tough.  Like, I can't watch movies where, you know, shit like that happens, or the kid, you know... 
[02:45:00]  Really?  ...is fucking...  They're great.  Or the kid gets kidnapped, and you can't watch those kind of movies.  They're fucking tough.  Voss would be on the phone.  Would you take a half a million and a car?  This leads us to e-bay.  Bargaining.  E-bay.  Don't you like the e-bay?  Oh, I love it.  First of all, this can never happen on the road, because you spent 20 minutes on one  topic.  Exactly, yeah.  I would have been in my car already listening to you guys still talking about the topic. 
[02:45:30]  What are you kidding me?  Do you turn on the radio station, and do they ever talk bad about you after you leave and  stuff?  No, I've never turned...  One time, I think I turned it on somewhere, but no, they...  I don't...  I...  90% on the road kill, but there's times where...  Like, when I used to go with Bonnie, she would just get me in so much trouble.  You know, we went into some radio in Florida, Monsters or something, and there's like seven  people, and we walk in, and Bonnie goes, all right, who's the main monster here?  She just started smashing... 
[02:46:00]  Like, I smash them in a fun way.  Yeah.  She does it in, like, you know...  Vicious.  Vicious.  Like, why am I here?  That's a funny line, though.  I know.  She's had us kicked out of a couple places.  That's awesome.  We went to a meeting once, big executives at NBC or whatever, you know, affiliate of NBC.  We didn't ask you about this.  I'm talking about...  Oh, my God.  And they go, where are you from?  And she says, my mom's pussy.  That was her opening line in the fucking meeting.  I swear to God.  It was the black lady, the Chinese guy. 
[02:46:30]  Good for her.  And she goes, my mom's pussy.  Obviously, that meeting tanked.  We've probably got to head sort of break.  Unless you've got something big on that list.  Well, I just remind...  She reminds me of pirates.  Ah, pirates.  You know, we'll talk pirates after the break.  Somali pirates.  Because we might be able to...  We got John...  Leguizamo.  Leguizamo.  Thanks for saying that.  Because I have a tough time saying that guy's last name.  Leguizamo.  Funny farm.  Funny farm in Roswell this week and next week in the Stress Factory. 
[02:47:00]  Are you going to make Mr. Leguizamo have five topics?  No.  Oh.  Golf is on your list, and we've got a guy that wants to give you free golf in Atlanta.  Matt, I hope so.  In Atlanta.  Matt?  Hey, boss.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, boss.  One of my next-door neighbors, he's a big fan, but he's in the middle of work right now.  He's the head superintendent at a pretty exclusive private course in Atlanta.  Yeah, I've got a radio show.  What?  White columns?  No, it's about six, seven miles south.  I really can't say it. 
[02:47:30]  It's more private than white columns.  Oh, really?  So, I want to play Friday and Saturday.  One of Friday or Saturday.  What are you going to play?  Did you hang up on him?  Email me.  Email me.  He only hears this.  Don't fucking turn that off.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You keep fucking golf blocking.  Sirius XM. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  We're going to have a big star in studio in a few minutes here.  A big star.  John Leguizamo.  Yes.  I think I said it right that time.  Yeah.  And Fisher Stevens.  Yeah.  Who's more like a, what?  Producer now.  Producer now?  Yeah.  He's producing the new play.  Yep.  I heard the morning mashup.  Ghetto clown.  Morning mashup went and saw John Leguizamo and said the play was really good.  Yeah.  I saw his one man show a few years back. 
[02:48:30]  I think we were at any W.  Yeah, man.  Guy knows what he's doing up there.  Obviously.  You moving over there, Rich?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  He's moving over there.  No, that's good.  I like having you as a buffer.  What do you got?  I don't like having the guests like next to me.  Is that rolling?  I don't know why.  Am I young enough to be next to you?  Please.  That's the third time I used that joke today.  I know.  But how many times do you guys use slobber and fucking slur jokes?  Oh, that's true.  Fucking Jew jokes? 
[02:49:00]  Well, not as often.  They're not fucking pirates.  And I didn't make this up.  I heard another radio announcer say this.  Okay.  They're not pirates.  The media glorifies them like they're pirates.  They're terrorists.  Yes.  Okay?  They're not pirates.  They're fucking...  When you see pirates, you think, Johnny Depp, arrr, arrr, arrr.  Just go ahead and think, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr, arrr.  And I didn't make that up.  I heard another host say it.  They're romanticizing it.  You're right.  They're romanticizing it.  It's the fucking media.  Okay?  Think Johnny Depp.  It's not Johnny Depp getting on your yacht. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  No.  No.  And causing you a little problem.  Come on in, gentlemen.  No.  It's not at all.  That's good.  Very relaxed atmosphere.  Oh, we're on the air.  We don't...  We're just...  John Leguizamo in studio with Fisher Stevens.  Fisher Stevens.  Hey, guys.  Welcome.  John Leguizamo.  Oh, what a chair.  Got Ghetto Clown, your show.  That's right.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Hanging out.  I'm going to go after the interview, which is always smart.  Yeah.  What after the one?  It'll be better.  I wanted to go yesterday, but I got a kid I had to babysit, so... 
[02:50:00]  Yours or somebody else's?  Mine, yeah.  Yeah, we were just talking about how creepy guy babysits us.  He's got you back.  He's babysitting.  Yeah, the pay really sucks here.  It drives people out there, like...  It drives them crazy.  They're like, it's your kid.  You're not babysitting.  You're parenting.  I'm like, I like to say I'm babysitting, though.  Your wife must be like that.  Huh?  Does she pay you, your wife?  Yeah, she pays me.  All right.  50 cents an hour.  She'll make you pay.  We have a lot of people bringing their kids babysitting during the show.  Yeah, really?  There was a kid last night.  There was a kid last night? 
[02:50:30]  It was like church.  All I was saying, I was supposed to go.  I did not go, but other people that work here at SiriusXM did go and said,  holy mackerel, this thing is good.  That's all.  That's all I was getting at.  Holy mackerel.  Who went Kathleen Bates for misery?  You fucking asshole.  I just wanted to say this.  Holy mackerel.  Holy moly.  Holy cow.  When you guys walked in, I just realized this.  Every time a guest comes in, listen, I'm not fucking part of it.  I'm a guest, too.  I'm not like the third guy.  I don't want you to look at me as a radio guy.  I'm a major.  I'm not attacking you, man.  I'm not looking down on you. 
[02:51:00]  I'm not a union bust up.  I love my unions.  I'm a major stand-up fucking headliner comic that was big five years ago.  He's working his way back.  I respect you.  I respect you in the future.  You scare me.  You got tats in it.  John, you know who he is, right?  Rich Voss.  Yes, it do.  You know me?  No.  I know all your partners from back in the day.  I can't really remember.  I don't know anybody right now.  I'm kind of tired.  I see.  He's being polite.  That was him being polite.  I don't care.  Listen, I know he doesn't know me.  You're a shitty radio guy like us today.  Yeah, really. 
[02:51:30]  Don't try to talk your way out of this garbage.  You're as big a hack as we are right now.  I'm here plugging just like they are.  So go fuck yourself.  And I said this on radio once on this show.  Yeah, Broadway show or some shitty comedy club in Atlanta.  Yeah, that's the same thing.  Oh, listen, listen.  Okay.  Sorry, Fisher.  I was saying how hot he was where he played the transvestite.  Remember I was saying that when we were talking about transvestites?  Oh, no, not that.  We're not going there.  Holy shit.  That's 10 years ago.  Do you know how much prison mail I got for that?  I bet.  That's in the show.  Yeah, somebody gave away my address online at that time. 
[02:52:00]  And I started getting all this prison mail from a couple of jails.  And I was like, I was going to have to move.  I was scared.  Were you just being the most straight ahead, not doing anything illegal guy at that point,  knowing that if you went in, you would just be the queen of the weight room ball?  They're still waiting for him, bitch.  They're still waiting for him.  Big Bubba, chocolate thunder.  That does kind of suck that, like, it's like men dressed as women and you were the hot one.  I know, yeah, exactly. 
[02:52:30]  I was too good.  Too good.  I was too good.  He's sad.  Eh, hell.  Hey, he's doing that a little too well.  Well-known role.  Well-known role.  Luckily, Wesley wasn't that hot because now he's, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank God because, you know, he'd have his situation.  Wesley looks like he could take care of his shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, he can now.  He's a real fighter.  He's a real black, though.  He's doing fine in there.  Yeah, for real.  Exactly.  He's training 24-7.  I played his trainer, actually, in a movie.  Really?  In Undisputed.  I played his agent.  Oh, Jesus.  Really?  We're going to go visit Wesley, actually.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, see how he's doing. 
[02:53:00]  As soon as the show gets-  If we get good reviews.  We've got to stay away from the prison if we get bad reviews.  How long did he get?  Two years?  Two or three years, right?  He really got-  Ah, they screwed him.  I was so bad, man.  He seemed to make an example of him.  I know, they screwed him.  He's being used, man.  It's really terrible that, yeah, he-  He's such a bright dude, man.  Such a smart guy, funny guy.  His kids speak four languages, man.  Yeah.  They came to my house.  They prayed in Spanish.  They can speak Korean, French, fluently, better than I do.  Speak Spanish. 
[02:53:30]  Jesus.  I don't speak Korean.  Maybe they should have interpreted that textbook into a-  Oh, my God.  You guys are going to read legalese.  If they read legalese, it'd be a different situation.  Yeah, that's one language.  Tell us about the show.  I know you guys want to talk about the show.  Ghetto Clown.  Let Fish talk.  Yeah.  I'm talking about this.  Because all he does is talk in the show, and all I do is listen to him.  But I love it.  That's a great way to start the relationship.  I love it.  I love it.  Yeah, sure you do.  Basically, it's the story of John's or an artist's career and life in the- not just in the movie and theater career, but basically how he got inspired, what got him to start getting into writing, which is what kind of spurred John's career, actually. 
[02:54:00]  Because I met John in 1988.  We were doing a Midsummer Night's Dream at the Public Theater with F. Marie Abraham and Elizabeth McGovern.  We were both 24.  We were 24 years old, and he was Puck, and I was Demetrius.  And we were both kind of rebel rousers and rowdy kids. 
[02:54:30]  And he, during one of the scenes where I-  When I was on stage, he put itching powder in my jock, and I-  I bought it at the joke shop.  I was playing Puck.  I was-  You know, I'm the funny guy in the show.  I'm going to be the funny guy.  There you go.  Why do you pick on me?  Why do you pick on me?  Why do you pick on me?  Why do you pick on me?  Why do you pick on me?  Exactly.  So I'm itching my balls.  I know exactly who it is.  So I knew-  But you were screaming, dog.  You were screaming.  Because that itching powder is being bullshit, man.  Because it's actually like fiberglass.  It's burning powder.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:55:00]  It's like little nettles that get in there.  You put it on every morning?  Attic work.  I didn't always have this cushy job.  I used to crawl around in attics, and that insulation itches.  That shit makes you itch.  And that's what they put in the thing, and he puts it in my jock, and I'm screaming on  stage with Elizabeth McGovern.  She thinks like-  She thinks you're hot for her, but it's just your balls on fire.  That's what was hot.  And then, so when John went on, I took shaving cream, and I shaving creamed his next costume  and his entire dressing room.  In my backpack, in my shoes.  All his shit, his scripts, his shoes, everything. 
[02:55:30]  The phone got fined by Equity.  Actors had re-fined us.  Really?  You got a harassment thing?  Yeah, yeah, we-  Harassed each other?  Actors' Equity is a great union, but they play-  Anyway, we don't want to get into the union discussion today.  There is no union discussion.  Unions rule, and that's it.  So, shut up.  So we-  Shut up.  Shut up.  So I've known the guy a long time.  Then we did Super Mario Brothers, and while we were doing it, he was always writing.  And he'd already done one show at that point, Mamble Mouth.  Right, right.  But he was writing his second show. 
[02:56:00]  He'd be shooting all day.  You know, we'd be shooting, and then we'd go play basketball.  Well, I'd have to write, because me doing Super Mario Brothers, that movie sucked, let's be honest.  And I had to feel like I was going to do something better with my life, because that movie might have ended my career.  Oh, shit.  So I was in panic mode.  Quick, get me a pen.  So Fisher would give me shrooms and stuff, so I wouldn't calm down.  I helped him write Spikorama in a different way.  I was his dealer.  So then we-  I was kind of blown away, because Super Mario Brothers actually did ruin my career, because I didn't write anything. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, shit.  You weren't writing.  Anyway, I know I hated to write, but-  So about two years ago, John did a little- did workshops of this piece, and asked me to- and it was a very interesting piece about his growth as an artist.  And we started working about a year and a half ago together, and here we are on Broadway.  And, you know, with this show, it's like I'm trying to- we're trying to do something that's raw, more dangerous than everybody's ever done.  You know, take that one-minute shit, because I've done a couple already, so we wanted to go balls out. 
[02:57:00]  And it's been scary.  He's been a little- it's been a little tough, you know, a little- you know, got a couple of lawsuit calls and stuff like that.  Oh, really?  From- from- from mentioning names and-  Mentioning some people.  Just talking about shit, honestly?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's pushing it.  And even people who aren't celebrities-  Yeah, yeah.  ... called me up and said, you know, you're saying this about her, and you can't say this, because you're not a doctor, so you're not allowed to make-  Because I was calling her a psycho.  Can you say- can you say in my opinion?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you can say in my opinion. 
[02:57:30]  If you say in my opinion.  You have problems, huh?  Huh?  Well, I don't know.  Uh, I'm an entertainer- yeah, in my opinion, then you can't get through it.  You're allowed- you're allowed to say it, but it's still-  Yeah.  You still- you still can be going- taking the court for that.  But John's also, I think, you know, you're going to dark places in your own life about yourself.  Right, right, yeah, yeah.  He's- he's revealing shit about himself that he's never revealed before.  Right, right.  Or that I-  I was scared when my wife saw it.  I was afraid she was going to leave me.  Right, but she loves him now.  She got- she got lucky after he saw it.  Do you feel like, because you've done a few one-man shows, do you feel like you have to 
[02:58:00]  try to top yourself?  Yeah, absolutely.  And then the pressure must be on, because-  Yeah, always.  So now you've got to get more dangerous.  You've got to let people in a little more.  You've got to try crazier stuff, and, you know, just go further, man.  You know, just reveal more.  I mean, in some ways it's incredible.  As an artist, as a person, it sucks a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  You put all your dirty shit out there that you don't really- you want to seem like you're  at the top of your game.  I wouldn't even try to compare any aspect of your life and celebrity with mine, but  on this radio show- okay, there is none. 
[02:58:30]  That's what I meant, Rich.  But on this radio show, we've noticed, and me and Opie have talked about this, when you're  having a slow day and there's nothing really in the news, you find you just start talking  about shit in your life that you would never mention.  Why don't I mention that?  Now you would never talk about it.  No, hell no.  It's called doing a fifth step.  That's what it is.  It's where you air out all your dirty laundry.  Don't start this 20-12 step.  How many steps is it?  Is that 12 steps?  12 steps?  Yeah.  He's 25 years sober. 
[02:59:00]  He wants to tell you.  25 years sober.  All right.  Congratulations.  See, you got your-  Crack, freebase, everything.  25 years of waste in time.  25.  Monday.  You did crack?  There was a fact.  They looked good.  You used to blow guys for crack.  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  You kiss it doesn't mean it's a blow job.  Okay, if it doesn't cross your gum lines.  He would wear-  Okay, you're not in the club.  Mickey Rourke before the-  Before he had his surgery.  Yeah.  Yeah, thank you. 
[02:59:30]  That's whatever.  That's a compliment.  That is a compliment.  But when you let out, when you air out all your stuff, it frees you of all your fucking  inner demons.  No, it's true.  It's true.  I mean, it totally-  Well, I mean, because it's-  What can anybody sling at you now?  Right.  You sling at yourself.  That's the best thing.  And being in the public eye or putting yourself out there, as they say, it makes it so much  easier when you do say shit like that, because, yeah, no one can then say shit about you.  You read stuff on the internet, and it's like, I've thrown out crap on this show that 
[03:00:00]  puts that to shame, so shut up.  Right, right, right.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Exactly, exactly.  But it's hard to cross that line on yourself.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now, early on in the earlier one-man shows-  Bitch slap yourself is not a cool thing, you know what I mean?  But once you cross that line, then you're kind of okay.  I can bitch slap you, but-  Did you realize earlier on in the one-man shows that, like, I'd like to say that, but  I'm going to hold that back.  I'm not going to fucking expose that.  Oh, absolutely, yeah, yeah.  I mean, also, because, you know, once you put that stuff out there like that on print  and in a show, you can't take it back, you know? 
[03:00:30]  Like, you know, like, when I did Spickerama, my mom was really upset about the whole situation  and the freak my father was going to sue me and everything.  Oh, shit.  And they were all pissed off.  Really?  And my mom is really, she's really uptight about this one.  I haven't even told my father.  No, I guess he knows.  Well, he'll know.  It's on a bus poster.  It's all over.  But it doesn't say it's about you.  Right, but he probably figured it out.  No, he's not.  That's what you should have called it.  It's about you.  So anyone that looks at it goes, fucking John.  Right.  He's screwing me over on this one. 
[03:01:00]  It's not about him.  It's about me.  I'm more attacking myself than everybody.  Were you close with your dad growing up?  Moments.  Moments.  We had moments of closeness.  Yeah.  Not a lot.  In general, not really, obviously.  Well, not really.  But we had some great moments.  There were some great moments of closeness.  But, you know, he was an immigrant.  You know, he was a hardworking man, 24-7 player.  Not much time for a little personal attention to the kids.  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  He liked the work.  He liked the ladies.  So there was no time for, you know, the rest of us. 
[03:01:30]  Which is great, because look at maybe who I am today, man.  Without that, I'd be just a regular Joe Schmo.  Like the rest of my friends.  Everyone in here is one of Santa's broken toys.  Yeah, it does.  You're not the only one.  Okay, you can go around the room.  Believe me.  His father made him his brother, and the father takes showers together.  No.  Okay.  There was one time he was trying to teach us how to shower when we were little kids.  And that...  In a hotel on vacation.  It wasn't a hotel on vacation.  Go fuck yourself. 
[03:02:00]  You're the creep.  I love the fantasies you bring up in your head.  That's crazy, man.  I love the fantasies in your head.  Whatever gets you off, Rich.  That's cool.  But Rich has the best stories.  Oh, please.  I got great stories.  Way better than what we have.  How's your mom shut up?  They're all fucked up.  My whole family was fucked up.  Use me as a pawn in your divorce.  But you know what?  I broke the chain of dysfunction with my kids when I got divorced.  I didn't fucking come see them every other week and fucking try to get the whole visit  in on, you know, hit them, take them out to dinner, buy them toys. 
[03:02:30]  I spent time...  I raised my kids.  Okay?  So I broke the chain of dysfunction.  So you can't...  You know, whatever happens...  Your psycho babble is disgusting.  You want a hug from everybody in the room?  Yeah, what do you want?  I was digging it.  I was like, whoa.  You were digging it.  I thought you were going to say you abandoned your kids.  You just didn't see them.  No.  I'm going to make a cycle.  Stop wasting the time.  He breaks the chain of dysfunction by leaving his family.  No, that's nice.  I'm fucking out.  I'm white, man.  You know, Fisher, I...  That's a big confession. 
[03:03:00]  There's something going on...  No people knew that yet.  There's something going on in here with one of the guys that works here who insists he  knew you or knows you or knew you in college or whatever the hell it was.  I was in college because I didn't go.  Okay, already.  Oh, my God.  This guy says you guys were best friends for a week and then you blew them off.  And then, like, something happened where you weren't friends anymore.  But, like, you hung out and were really friends for a week.  And played basketball, right?  I'm just calling severe bullshit on this one.  But you were talking to him. 
[03:03:30]  Don't even say his name.  Fisher's always playing b-ball.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to see if Fisher even recognized.  Get in here, Mars.  Now, do you know this guy?  What's up, Fisher?  Fisher, you look scared.  You know him.  You know him.  I know him.  He's put on weight.  He's lost a little hair.  He's lost a little hair.  He's lost a little hair.  He's put on weight.  But we didn't go to college together.  No, I assume you went to NYU because we played ball there all the time.  I was a member of the gym.  There you go. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  Okay.  All right.  So he's partly right.  He's partly right.  He's partly right.  But now you were friends.  What kind of friendship did you have?  Yeah, because he's hurt, Fisher.  He's hurt.  Very injured.  What happened was that it was a good week.  We hung out and we were playing ball over at the NYU gym.  What year?  What year?  That was, I think, in 88 or 89.  He was doing short circuit two.  Oh, my kids saw that last night.  They loved it, Sish.  That was like 80, 80.  He played the first Indian man, the white guy, to play Indian man.  Nobody was doing that before. 
[03:04:30]  Now you couldn't do that.  Now you couldn't get away with that.  No.  The Indian guy would be like, I want that shit.  You'd be like.  They'd outsource your ass.  We're going to collect you and take you somewhere and technologically improve you.  I did get offered a couple of Bollywood films after that movie.  Did you?  For real?  Thinking I was.  People actually thought you were Indian.  Yeah, yeah.  It was nice.  He wants you to help him with his two-man show.  You should have taken those jobs.  Why did you turn those jobs down, man?  Don't believe me.  It was a bad mistake.  Yeah, it was.  No better now.  Hindsight, you know?  Always 20, 20.  So we played basketball?  For a week.  We played basketball for approximately a week, maybe two. 
[03:05:00]  Full court?  Full court or half?  Half court.  Oh, so you really got to know each other a little closer.  Right.  And we also went to dinner.  No homo.  We went to dinner.  I went to dinner.  And he stayed in character.  We went to an Indian restaurant and he spoke to me.  Oh, I was doing...  I was...  I was...  Yes.  You said that already.  I was a method actor.  Yeah.  I was trying to live the life of the Indian.  I actually went to India and almost died doing research.  You're stoic?  Yeah, my stomach. 
[03:05:30]  I had the worst dysentery.  I decided I was from Gujarat, from a poor village.  So I went and lived in a poor village, but there were no toilets.  And I happened to get dysentery and basically sat in a river for a week.  Wow, man.  That's crazy.  You could have just gone to the Indian restaurant around...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's all I needed.  You could have hung out the whole time.  I would have saved a lot of money.  I would have saved a lot of money, too.  I had a heartache.  Yeah.  I don't think...  Now, the thing is, he's remembering this stuff.  I don't think he's really remembering doing any of this with you.  Like, he remembers the method acting, the Indian restaurants, but I don't think Marcelino's... 
[03:06:00]  There's no story with him.  There's no, like, oh, he cracked me up.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I remember.  Remember that move I made on the court when I fucking came over the top of you?  None of that.  And then you slammed it down?  No, it's more like I left town.  I was in another country where you weren't down.  I got exodus the way.  I actually broke into your apartment.  I lived there.  I sued your wife.  Yeah.  What happened, Mars?  Something's going to come.  Is that why...  That was dark fish.  Damn, where'd you go with that one, man?  It's these guys.  I'm getting their energy.  I like the way he plays to everybody else for his own shit. 
[03:06:30]  Dark evilness in this place.  He's right.  You do it a lot.  You blame other people for yourself.  He's a method actor.  It's a horrible place.  He felt the vibe and he went with it.  The studio's an awful place.  But Mars says, Fisher, that then you blew him off after this unbelievable weak relationship.  It's just...  All of a sudden you dropped off the face of the earth.  Because he probably had another movie.  He was filming a movie.  Don't be familiar to me, too, man.  Who are you?  I'm Puerto Rican, so...  Oh, that's why.  That's why.  Yeah, yeah.  You're like a cousin or something. 
[03:07:00]  John Digo.  You go to NYU.  Cousin or something, yeah.  I did go to NYU.  I dropped down, but I went there.  But Mars wants to know...  NYU, the evil empire.  Mars wants to know why you blew off the friendship that he thought he had.  Sorry.  Because I was probably an egocentric young actor full of himself at the time.  And you were just a piece of shit.  Exactly.  And things haven't really changed.  Did you feel like you guys were going to be friends for years?  Hey, I was hoping.  You were getting that vibe? 
[03:07:30]  Why not?  And you were like, oh, man.  You probably went home and told everybody, I'm playing fucking b-ball with the guy from  the fucking short second one.  Yeah, from short second one.  But you're Puerto Rican.  What do you expect?  Jesus, I didn't take it this far when my fucking first wife left me.  Oh, please.  Me the did she.  Oh, I'm rubbing your clothes.  Did I pay for the dinner, at least?  Absolutely.  Oh, look at that.  Was it just you two?  Spreading around that short circuit money.  A little foggy back in those days. 
[03:08:00]  Smoking a lot of weed.  I think there was...  You were his drug dealer.  I think there were other people with us.  I think so.  Supplying other suppliers.  Okay.  You never did hard drugs.  There it is.  He doesn't remember the other people.  It's hallucinogenic stuff.  Creative stuff.  Just creative drugs.  Shrooms, weed.  Right.  That's all.  You were a fucking fanboy.  That's right, baby.  Just telling everybody shit.  And he knew that.  That's why he had to leave.  So he's like, what am I going to do?  Hang out with a fanboy?  You don't need a yes man.  These guys don't hang out with fanboys.  Everybody needs a yes man. 
[03:08:30]  Shut the hell up.  There you go.  What the fuck?  The day's hard enough.  Life's tough enough.  You need some yes people around you.  You need some yes men, yeah.  Do you still play basketball?  Oh, really?  Look at him.  Look at him.  He's in.  This one's giving me ADD, man.  I can't with all the screens and TV and everything.  How do you guys play?  I know.  Really?  We fall out all the time.  We'll be in a conversation and be like, what?  Wow.  That looks awesome.  I mean, Gaddafi is dressed like Casper the Friendly Ghost.  Yeah, they got the uni stuff.  My wife's going to the union.  She's really going crazy.  What?  I think today.  Oh, really? 
[03:09:00]  The union protest?  The city hall in the protest, yeah.  Yeah.  There's one in New York?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's growing.  Oh, you didn't get the email, huh?  First of all, I live in Jersey.  Second of all, I didn't do enough TV last year for after to kick in for my health insurance.  So you're kind of resentful?  So you're not going to go?  No.  Why don't you go?  Why don't I go to a rally?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe because I'm going to my fucking Save the Whale rally today, okay?  Oh, speaking about the Cove.  Way to go, Rich. 
[03:09:30]  Way to go, Rich.  Thank you.  Mr. Stevens was the producer of the Cove when I saw him.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So he likes to, he likes that.  We have a big documentary coming out, Jim.  And fishies.  About what?  It's called Women Aren't Funny.  It's a documentary on female comics.  Women Aren't Funny.  Women Aren't Funny.  John, it's good.  It's fucking.  Are they funny?  That's because Bonnie McFarlane, his wife, is the one that's doing the whole thing, really.  We have every fucking big time.  And she's funny.  Is that your ex-wife or your present wife?  No, my present wife.  She's funny.  My ex-wife just moved to North Carolina. 
[03:10:00]  What did she do?  Who, my ex-wife or my new wife?  Yeah, ex-wife.  What did she do?  You had so many wives to talk about.  She was babysitting my new wife.  I know.  My ex-wife was babysitting my kid for my new wife, but she's moving.  But this fucking doc, no, the Cove.  What, are you fucking kidding me?  You're right.  Yeah, this is fucking, this is some real fucking stuff.  Well, well, during the Golden Globes, when I saw you get up there.  Oscars, not the Golden Globes.  Oscars, excuse me.  The Golden Globes, they don't acknowledge the documentaries of the Golden Globes.  It was the Oscars.  That's a lucky thing for you.  Excuse me.  No, no, I didn't mean to say that.  It's just the Golden Globes, they don't care about. 
[03:10:30]  Well, you're definitely not going to get nominated if they had a category now after  that, Comics of Golden.  Yeah, I know.  After, yeah, I don't think me and Ricky Gervais are going to ever be back in the Golden Globes.  Yeah, no, but when I found out you were involved with that, I was like, oh, fuck.  You know, that's pretty cool.  That was an amazing experience and it was weird because I actually decided to be, I had to  do, I was filming a whole other doc in a slaughterhouse and I saw how they were killing, you know,  cast. 
[03:11:00]  So I decided to become a pescatarian, only eat fish.  So I started eating a lot of tuna and then I got, I started feeling metal in my mouth,  run down.  I went and had my blood work done and I had incredible mercury poisoning.  You were like a thermometer.  I was.  That's right.  If anyone didn't feel well, I would just touch them and I could tell them exactly what, I  would turn red up to here, up to here.  But, and then when I got my friend, Jim Clark was financing the Cove and he said they, they  need to make a movie out of it.  They've been shooting, but there's no movie.  And I, I got obsessed with the whole dolphin thing. 
[03:11:30]  I didn't really care at the time about dolphins, to be honest.  I cared about the oceans.  Yeah.  I thought swimming with them was cool.  And then, yeah, then you learn about how they feel.  And then you learn about what the Japanese are doing.  And then we tried to make a kind of really interesting kind of oceans 11 type doc and  make it entertaining.  Cause you know, docs, I, I haven't seen yours.  I'm sure it's, it's, it's much easier if it's about a comic or comics, if it's about  people killing dolphins, that's tough to get an audience. 
[03:12:00]  That's more of an Oscar bait.  I mean, it's going to be hard for him to get Oscar.  Well, ours is, it's more of a comedy.  It's intertwined.  We're doing a reality based on our lives intertwined with a documentary, which it's kind  Hey John, do you use a mic during your show?  Yeah.  How about you use one here?  I want to be off the record.  Yeah.  So I mean, are you guys union?  That was union guy.  Union guy.  Yeah.  So yeah, it's intertwined.  It's not like, it's not an empowered thing. 
[03:12:30]  You'll learn from it.  But our goal is for people to walk out, you know, saying that was fucking funny.  To walk out halfway through it.  Excuse me.  You know, entertainers are talking now.  Fucking fly by night, CB fucking radio host.  Fly by night.  Set up one step above a podcast.  Have fun, Rich.  Because they're going to be gone.  We've been.  You look like Steve Buscemi a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  That's the tags. 
[03:13:00]  Buscemi was sick.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  You don't like us?  No.  You think John's going to remember you after he leaves?  You know I'm only kidding.  You only have us, brother.  In the end, you only have us.  Yeah, really.  Remember that.  It's going to be a time when we're just all sitting here.  You're going to want your fucking plug for the chuckle hut somewhere.  But the cove.  The cove, fuck.  But you made it entertaining.  Well, that was the goal. 
[03:13:30]  And, you know.  Fucking.  It's a tough watch at times.  It is.  Holy shit.  There's some moments that are.  And they're still killing them.  But not as many.  But that's why I picked Fisher to direct my show.  Because I saw the cove.  If he could work with dolphins, he could work with me.  And nothing changed.  Darkness.  You'd think some of these documentaries will change some shit.  It's changed a little bit.  They don't kill as many.  They still, you know.  But I think in the next year or two, it's getting better and better in terms of the awareness.  They banned the doc in Japan for a long time.  Yeah, but now it's coming back.  So we're actually, we open tomorrow in Japan on video. 
[03:14:00]  And it'll be all available to them.  We open in the theaters and select.  Actually, the Yakuza threatened the distributors.  They went to the house of the distributors.  Japanese mafia.  They threw rocks into their windows.  They followed the distributors' children.  That's all they did was throw rocks?  No, they followed them to school and threatened them.  I mean, it's opened up a definite wound in Japan.  It's a real tough mafia that throws rocks.  Break the window. 
[03:14:30]  Next time.  Well, that's the beginning.  Terrifying mob.  I've had rocks thrown through my winter.  It's not fun, dude.  So you won an Oscar for that.  Leave the rock.  Take the sushi.  Now, how did you burn the bridge?  What did you say you burned the bridge there at the Oscars?  Golden Globes.  The Golden Globes.  No, no, I didn't.  I'm just saying Golden Globes.  No, the Golden Globes doesn't recognize documentaries because it's the Golden Globes.  There's no category.  You've got to be a big star.  They want big stars.  They want Golden Globes.  They don't care about documentaries. 
[03:15:00]  I'm not going to diss the Golden Globes because...  What do you eat now?  Like, doing documentaries about slaughterhouses and that.  It's very hard for me to eat.  Like, how do you find food to eat?  Down to plants.  Yeah, I eat a lot of chia seeds.  Yeah, that's...  Chia.  I had them this morning.  They're delicious.  No, it is.  Phenomenal.  So tasty.  And then you go see a movie like Food, Inc.  And then you see how the corn is grown.  And then you see how the...  GMO'd food.  So now you can't eat anything without feeling fucked up.  It's kind of sad.  It's kind of a bummer.  It makes you want to just...  Tootsie Rolls.  Go back to just eating Tootsie Rolls and Swedish Fish. 
[03:15:30]  Well, then you read a book called Sugar Blues and you don't want to eat sugar.  I mean, everything is.  I know.  It's really...  You know what?  You know, a chicken is great, but boy, those chicken assembly lines are pretty nasty, too.  Oh, man.  Purdue or...  Kentucky Fried...  I used to work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.  I know what's...  That's not chicken.  Whatever that is.  What is that?  You know they couldn't call it Kentucky Fried Chicken.  You see it's KFC?  Because it's not chicken.  They don't have beaks.  What the fuck is it?  It's processed chicken meals.  It's pieces of... 
[03:16:00]  Even the breasts?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't eat that shit, but really?  Not anymore, you know.  No, I haven't eaten that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Back in the day.  Back, you know, after a day or in White Castle after, you know, a night out.  A night out, White Castle.  Oh, my God.  That was amazing, man.  One of those greasy sliders at 4 a.m. in the morning.  You didn't even have to get out of your car to throw the stuff in the garbage.  You could throw it right in the parking lot.  That's right.  That's right.  Right there.  Because you were just sitting there all fucking ugh and just throw the shit out.  You'd get into your car, though, the next day and still smell that shit. 
[03:16:30]  It was like fucking a fat girl.  And it comes back out.  Yeah, it's not good when it comes out.  Yeah, you've got to watch when that shit comes through you.  We're out of the house real fast.  Just get it done and leave.  Indian dysentery.  So there's really nothing you could eat?  I mean, there are.  I mean, you know, if you hang out with Woody Harrelson, you eat pretty well.  Yeah.  The vegetables, the vegan.  Vegan, but most of the vegans I know are very pale.  I hate fucking going out with a girl and she goes like, 
[03:17:00]  Oh, I'm a vegetarian or I'm a vegan.  Oh, but dude's a cheap date.  Come on, a couple of vegetables?  Yeah, but what a pain in the ass to try to find a place.  They're like, oh, and then ordering.  Is that cooked in a separate fucking thing that isn't cooked with the meat?  It's like, you know what's going on back there?  Shut up.  Don't worry about it.  Bonnie has a great...  She ate meat later, though, didn't she?  Yeah.  Union?  She's got to get her protein somewhere.  Holy cow.  On stage, Bonnie goes, I'm a vegan. 
[03:17:30]  I'm not talking down to you people.  I just choose to be a vegan.  Well, I cheat once in a while.  I eat veal.  It's so tender.  The worst thing.  Yeah, anything with the letter V.  Patrice tried to be a vegan for like a week or two.  Really?  For a while, Patrice was a vegan.  When I was in NYU, I was broke, and I used to tell girls I was a vegetarian so I could be cheap on dates and not have to buy steak.  Let's go, just some bean sprouts and shit.  You'd save a lot of steaks.  No steaks.  I can't eat the steak.  No, I can't eat the steak.  Let it be known that Mars was blown off again here, by the way. 
[03:18:00]  He's just standing in the office.  I'm sorry, buddy.  Oh, Fisher, man.  What the...  It's 1988 all over again.  The guy's having flashbacks over there.  Look, he's just hoping that...  I thought he was going to tell me that he came in and stole shit out of my house.  Oh, my God, because he's Latin?  Oh, Jesus, John.  He's hoping they can rekindle the one-week relationship they had.  He's having friggin' flashbacks.  Mars, you all right?  I'm perfect.  You all right?  So you realize now that this relationship was nothing, right?  No, I'm sorry, dude.  I'm sorry.  Put on an old Chicago song and cry? 
[03:18:30]  You can start again, man.  The opportunity's there to recreate that friendship.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  Go down to the gym, play some basketball.  I'm busy.  I've got to do a play.  I'm sorry, dude.  We haven't even really talked about the play, but I'm telling you, it's going to be another  great one.  John, I have to say, I've known John, as I said, in 88.  He's doing incredible work.  He's an inspiration to work with.  He's hilarious.  And he cries.  Who's the blonde?  Sorry.  Who's the blonde, Roland?  Those are the housewives.  Oh.  Which ones?  Which ones?  It doesn't matter. 
[03:19:00]  Is it New York?  Housewives are celebrities now.  What?  One's with no talent.  Real housewives of Miami.  Miami?  That's all of them.  The new show started last night.  Oh, great.  I just saw a blonde and just freaked out.  I was looking at Mars, man.  I'm sorry.  I know.  Yeah.  Mars.  I was finally giving him some love.  We have ADD on this show.  So, Ghetto Clown, you're saying it's his best work?  I think, well, I think he's incredible.  I think it is my best work, too, though.  I mean, working with Fish and I, I've been trying to, like, go as hard and crazy and still  be hilarious.  I think we've accomplished it.  Yeah.  It's pretty well.  I mean, we've been touring for two years now. 
[03:19:30]  I've been going around Canada.  Far away from everybody.  It's far away.  The show in the Ukraine really went over a bit.  So, that was a good idea.  I can't wait to see it.  You dig it.  I mean, it's really, and every night, you know, we've only...  I've seen John's stuff.  Always liked it.  Yeah.  And it's, Broadway's an incredible place to do it.  It's elevated both of us, our game.  Oh, hell yeah.  In an incredible way, so.  Because the risk is crazy.  Crazy risk.  You would rather do a, on stage and be in a movie, right? 
[03:20:00]  Would you rather be...  Hell yeah.  I mean, the feeling on stage...  I mean, yeah.  I mean, movies...  Instant satisfaction, yeah.  I just saw that fucking movie.  You got to...  Please, I want to go right to the source here.  What the fuck?  How did it end?  You were on the goddamn pool table, and then you disappear, right?  Pool table.  Oh.  Yeah.  And then everyone's fucking disappearing and shit.  Vanishing on seven street.  Vanishing on seven...  Vanishing on seven...  And then, like, where did you go?  I...  It's a Twilight Zone type of movie, brother.  It pissed me off! 
[03:20:30]  I was invested in the whole thing.  I'm watching it.  It's an intellectual movie.  I know.  That's why it's pissing you off.  I know.  That's what Brad...  Don't even try, then, boss.  No.  Come on.  It was fucking scary as hell, man.  No, it was scary and shit.  And then I'm like...  Tell me you weren't scared.  I was...  It was very fucking scary.  But then you were pissed off, too.  It was a scary movie.  But then it's one of those movies that ends, and I'm like,  I like movies that end, and I could just fucking forget about it.  But I don't like those as much as these movies that fuck me up,  because then I get on the internet, I'm starting to go,  what are other people saying about this fucking movie? 
[03:21:00]  Where the hell did they go?  John Leguizamo was on a pool table, now it's closer there.  Because they did mad research, man.  They did all that...  The Haldring...  Oh, man, what's that place in Geneva?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where they're banging particles together.  Right, right.  The particle accelerator.  Right, right.  Particle accelerator.  And they just did it recently.  They actually were able to...  Yeah, blasted that thing off.  You literally...  You literally...  You disappear.  You vanish.  But then it's like, I exist, I exist, I exist.  But you don't.  Well, you don't, because if you stop feeling like you exist, you do disappear.  Don't you feel like that sometimes when you wake up in the morning at the hangover? 
[03:21:30]  But how did the light keep it on?  What was with the light?  I'm not going to reveal all the secrets of the play.  Because he doesn't know.  Fuck!  He doesn't remember.  God damn it!  He's long past that.  I know!  He doesn't even remember.  That was three movies ago.  Yeah, exactly.  They're saying, come on, that movie's great.  I love Brad Adams.  He did the Machinist and Christian Bale.  He did the creepy, scary...  The Machinist was great.  I was more in for the journey than the destination.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  You know, it was...  Is there a movie that Christian Bale won't lose weight for?  That's two years. 
[03:22:00]  He's done.  That's two years.  But he loved...  The mechanic was sick.  He looked like...  And then he buffed up for friggin' Batman.  And he was great in The Fighter.  Unbelievable, man.  He was incredible in The Fighter, man.  Unbelievable.  He's going to take that Oscar hands down.  Yeah, he's a good man.  So I thought doing the movie with Brad Anderson would give me the stick with the other...  I didn't lose enough weight, obviously.  Hey, what movie's going to win the Oscar this year?  King's Speech.  King's Speech, hands down.  Everyone's saying that, huh?  Yeah, yeah, man.  It's got to.  It's the tightest story.  The tightest story.  The best journey of all of them.  It's...  I like Social Network. 
[03:22:30]  I like Social Network.  I like Winter's Bone.  That was a great movie, too.  That was a great movie.  That won't wait.  You know what was great about it?  You didn't know if those were really actors or people from the fucking Ozark.  I like when that happens.  It was both.  Animal Kingdom was amazing, man.  Yeah.  Everybody's like blanked out.  It's Australian.  It's an Australian.  The Australian flick was incredible.  I loved it.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That was like a gangster film made for no money.  Oh, wait.  I saw a part of that.  You know what I mean?  It was too tight.  No, I fell.  See, I didn't see.  It's where the fucking name was.  The family.  The family.  Yeah, the family.  I was just too out of it. 
[03:23:00]  She got nominated for an Oscar.  Like a tiny, low-budget movie like that again.  Any attention?  The mom.  The mom of Animal Kingdom.  Okay.  Yeah.  She was nominated for an Oscar.  Jackie Weaver, though, you know it's got to be a good flick.  We're getting the wrap-up.  Oh, we've got to go to another radio station.  Yeah, you've got a lot of stuff to do.  We're doing the tour.  Sorry about that.  I don't know if it's...  I tried to make you feel special, but I've got to go to another one.  You actually did.  You know?  I'll be honest.  I don't know if we did Ghetto Clown Justice, but I'm certainly going.  Well, come see it.  And then we'll talk about it a little more, you know?  Definitely, man.  Oh, you're going to love it, man.  But Legu Zamo on fucking Broadway.  You can't go wrong. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, we're going to destroy it.  Ghetto Clown.  What else do you guys want to promote real fast?  Yeah.  Anything else there, Fisher?  You're good?  What I'm doing?  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm doing a documentary called My Decision, so I've been around the world following interesting  people making big decisions in their life.  I just actually was with this kid, Jadavian Clowney, who was the number one football prospect  in high school who was trying to decide what college to go to.  He just chose South Carolina.  But that, to somebody who's deciding to have a sex change operation, to somebody who's deciding  how to treat cancer, to someone who's deciding to get divorced. 
[03:24:00]  I mean, like, so I've been, I went to Egypt, right, three months ago.  Wow.  Had no idea this was going to happen, obviously.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  A woman deciding to actually become religious.  So, I've been doing that, and I'm going to play Glenn Close's Shrink on Damages.  Oh, it's the best fucking show.  You like Damages.  Oh, fuck, I can't wait for season three to come out on video.  That's one of the great shows.  I'm going to get on video.  John, you good?  We've got to get you out of here.  Anything else you want to promote?  I've got a lot of movies coming out, but.  All right, Ghetto Clown, though, is the big one. 
[03:24:30]  Ghetto Clown is what we love.  Let the other suckers promote their food.  GhettoClown.com, Clown with a K, for all the info.  Yeah, yeah, for all the other.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  This was a pleasure, man.  A lot of fun.  Thanks a lot for a little, man.  I think we're ending the show.  Rich?  Rich Atlanta?  Fuck Rich.  Okay, Rich Voss.  Funny Farm Comedy Club in Atlanta this weekend, and then the Stress Factory next weekend.  See you guys tomorrow.

[03:25:30]  And...  They'll continue to...  So...  So...  So...  Hello?  I'm...  And...  Don't change the...  This...  This...  Nation.  The virus.  Sirius.  Or ... 
[03:26:00]  97.  XM202.  From Stinko Records, it's the new collection of covers from America's favorite derelict.  I'm the original Golden Mother.  Tiffy Tom, regurgitated.  Tom Jones.  It's not unusual to be in love.  He's drunk, smells like feet.  It's not unusual.  And he's forgotten most of the lyrics.  Tiffy Tom, regurgitated.  Chews up your favorite pop hits. 
[03:26:30]  She's a lady.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's a lady.  And spews them back out, dirtier, grittier, and stinkier than farts and old beer.  But the lady is mine.  Or something like that.  From your favorite haunting melodies.  Riders on the storm.  Something like that.  To your most cherished classic rock cut.  Come on, baby, light my fire.  Tiffy Tom hunkers down, craps all over him, and refuses to wipe. 
[03:27:00]  Trying to sit the night on fire.  And if you act now, you'll receive Tiffy Tom's tribute to the town he calls home.  I've been stuck on Frank Sinatra.  Start spreading the news.  It's old blue eyes.  I'm leaving today.  Meets old crusty eyes.  I'm gonna be a part of it.  New York, New York.  It's a sappy salute to the city that broke his spirit, crushed his dreams, and left him blowing strange men for cheap wine in the Port Authority bus terminal. 
[03:27:30]  If I can make it here, I can make it.  Tiffy Tom.  Anywhere.  Regurgitated.  It's up to you, New York.  New York.  That's my vote.  Wrapped in a special carrying case, brown in the back, yellow in the front, just like Tom's underwear. 
[03:28:00]  Call 1-800-NO-T-CELL right now for your copy of Tiffy Tom.  Regurgitated.  Any more requests? </pre>
