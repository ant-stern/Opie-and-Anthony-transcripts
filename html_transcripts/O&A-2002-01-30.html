<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a brief mention of a pinball machine incident involving a producer from a competing show, before diving into their "Naughty Nighty" contest, a listener-participation event featuring women submitting lingerie photos for online voting and prizes.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Andy, spent considerable time reviewing these photos, using highly explicit and offensive language to describe the women's bodies and commenting extensively on the geographical disparity in participation, with Washington, D.C. significantly outperforming New York City.  They detailed issues with photo submissions, including poor photo choices and ID verification problems.  Numerous listener calls commented on the contest and the photos, often contributing to the sexually suggestive banter.

A significant subplot involved the hosts offering Super Bowl tickets contingent on three women from Boston participating in the "Naughty Nighty" contest; failure to meet this condition meant the tickets would be destroyed on air.  As a humorous alternative, a clam chowder-eating/puking contest was devised, with the last person to vomit winning the tickets. This contest was further elaborated upon with the mention of Patty's toenails being a potential addition.  The hosts also recounted a past prank call where they tricked a pizza parlor employee into stripping down to his underwear for a fake Super Bowl ticket giveaway, detailing the employee's adornment with pepperoni and cheese.

In-studio guests Dennis Leary and Adam Ferrara, promoting their show "The Job," joined the broadcast.  The conversation with Leary and Ferrara covered various topics, including product placement in "The Job," upcoming episodes, Leary's involvement in a Worcester firefighter's foundation event, his dislike for the Los Angeles Rams, and his catchphrases ("Life sucks, get a helmet," "Capital N, small Y, big effin' Q," and "Shut the eff up, next").  The hosts and guests reacted to listener calls with vulgar language and offensive jokes, often involving sexually suggestive discussions. One caller described a "race shoot," leading to further discussion of her photos.  The show also included a lengthy discussion about the protests surrounding the World Economic Summit in New York, interwoven with unrelated tangents about USA cigarettes, the aftermath of 9/11, and the personalities of protestors and police officers.

A call with a 12-year-old boy named Gary, who was relentlessly teased about his romantic relationship and breakup with his 13-year-old girlfriend, resulted in sexually suggestive innuendo and humor at the child's expense.  Steve-O from "Jackass" also called in, discussing his new DVD featuring dangerous stunts, including setting his hair on fire, consuming a boiled possum, and receiving a vodka IV.  The conversation also included descriptions of Steve-O's girlfriend’s alleged sexual encounters and intoxication.

Further listener calls featured updates from various locations, including Boston (where two partially clad women were at the WBCN studio, planning to participate in the chowder contest), and Cleveland (with female callers planning to submit photos).  A "six o’clock queef" segment from a female listener was played.  The hosts also mentioned a future guest, Gina Gershon, who was scheduled to appear in her underwear, and a planned feature involving a "Chinese naked midget" from a movie.  A recurring bit involved repeatedly saying "Quiet. Exactly."  The show concluded with additional listener calls, including a verbally abusive argument between two callers, promotion of Leary's "The Job," the "Naughty Nighty" contest, Opie and Anthony's website, and a Boston road trip.  A humorous, crude John Madden parody about a gay male orgy was also included, and the hosts repeatedly used the phrase "cleanse the palate" while transitioning between reviewing photos in the "Naughty Nighty" contest.  There was also mention of a  planned reshoot for one of the Naughty Nighty contestants and a plea for more female callers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I'm a kook magnet, I swear to God.  And one of them works for Ron and Fez, the show that's on after us here in New York.  He's their producer, well that's what they call him.  Al Dukes is a fag, basically.  The guy is attracted to you.  I don't think I've ever said hi to him officially.  He bought me a present.  A $3,000 classic Rolling Stones pinball machine.  It was just, I brought a nice gesture.  Oh God.  He's got the big Gallagher mallet.  Oh Jesus Christ.  Make him kiss Mick Jagger goodbye.  Oh my God, no. 
[00:00:30]  No.  Oh no, he's got it.  Smash.  Oh my God.  Keith Moon lives.  Keith Moon lives.  Oh no, no, the moon's going to take it.  We're down.  Smash.  A work relationship.  Smash.  I was just making a nice gesture.  Oh.  Smash.  There is a mess out there. 
[00:01:00]  No, it looks like James Dean's car.  Opie lost his effing mind.  It's gone.  There is one heartbroken little Nancy boy out there.  That's what I think of your kid.  And that's what I think of you.  And welcome to the O&A show.  Hello.  After seeing what Steve-O could do?  Yeah.  I'm nothing with that pinball machine thing.  I'm nothing.  Steve-O would have thrown his body through it.  That's true. 
[00:01:30]  God, we were just watching a little bit of his DVD in the back office.  Oh my God.  That's out of his friggin' mind.  Funny as hell though.  That's all the stuff MTV wouldn't show on Jackass with Steve-O.  When he does that stuff with the fireworks, he launches a bottle rocking out of his mouth first.  It just goes all over his face.  Then one out of his butt.  Then he put a bunch of like mats and mats of firecrackers on himself and just lit it up. 
[00:02:00]  Would you say like 10,000 to 20,000?  Yeah.  They were going off forever.  That's all you heard.  He was sick bastard.  But then again, we knew that already.  Is it too hard for the people in these offices and studio to put the toilet paper back on the roll?  You know, you unwrap it and just put it up on the back of the toilet bowl.  Can't you put it on the roll?  How many people have heard that?  Do you still use that bathroom? 
[00:02:30]  Nah, I just had to blow my nose.  I was like, oh, look at this.  Somebody actually just put the roll on the back of the toilet.  But like, does that bother you?  It doesn't bother me at all.  I think it sit there for a year.  I could give a crap.  I remember when I was married, that was a big issue.  Oh, is that why you're bringing it up?  No, I just saw it there and it gave me a chuckle because I knew I didn't have to put it on the goddamn roll.  It didn't matter to me.  Well, we could discuss that for a half hour.  No, what are you kidding?  It's a quick little chuckle for me in there.  The first chuckle of the show? 
[00:03:00]  I'm chuckling.  I guess I don't have to tune away, Rick.  There's going to be plenty of chuckles today on the show.  20 minutes.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, give us a call, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar are stopping by from ABC's The Job, which is on tonight at 930.  Oh, my God, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  Completely forgot.  Because technically we're in winter mode as far as Whip-Em-Out Wednesday goes. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, but lovely weather so far.  All right.  It's going to get colder, though, I hear.  Leanne has a problem, and she's calling long distance, so let's get this out of the way.  Leanne, problem?  What's up?  Hey.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'll just start that over again with your potty mouth.  Oh, sorry.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm going to pick you up again, too, because something's wrong with the microphones.  Okay.  She had a little potty mouth.  Dad.  God forbid we, it still sucks, God forbid we start a show with all the equipment working properly. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Listen, what is this problem?  Can you hear it on your radio?  Yeah, it's got sort of an underwater sound to it.  Can I hear it on my radio?  I don't know, Leanne.  So, basically, you're saying they took Essie pictures of you for the Naughty Nighty contest.  No, we took killer pictures.  All right.  What's wrong with these?  We took, like, 16 pictures, all right.  I'm looking at these right now.  All of them, right?  What's the problem?  Like, we went through them, and we were like, all right, there was, like, five we wanted  to send.  Yeah.  Okay, so then I called the guy that took on the Godfather on our station, I-H-9, right? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  I called and say, I'm like, what happened?  You're supposed to send the good ones.  And he's like, oh, I don't know.  They just picked the ones that they wanted.  Those are ugly.  I look terrible almost.  By the way, if you're online right now, go to opianthony.com, and you can check out Leanne's  pictures as we're doing right now.  Contestant number 36.  See, and they're brutal.  T-minus 60 seconds before I break this mic, by the way.  No, it's not the mic.  What is it?  It's just sometimes when we get a call, it does this.  It has that underwater sound to it.  It's not that bad.  At least it's not going, we'll just have to muddle through. 
[00:05:00]  So, you're not happy with the pictures they put up there for you, right?  No, but don't you have, like, all 16 of them?  Did we get all 16?  You should.  He said he sent the whole thing, and we went through them.  So, you guys picked the terrible.  Like, those ones are...  We probably have them, but you know what?  Those are probably the best ones.  No, they're not, though.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, because the couch shot looks a little strange.  Someone is trying to imitate Rick's picture-taking style.  Rick's style, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  And they didn't pull it off with the couch picture.  That's not bad.  They should have gone to the side a little more, Rick,  and gone a little more to the arch of the back, I think.  Right, right, right.  Too much of the from-the-back shot might not be good.  His ass is too fat.  It looks very inviting.  Yes, he's inviting.  Those are good pictures.  Shut up, Rick.  What?  Anyway, yeah.  I think it looks good.  I like the way your face looks in picture three.  Listen, they're so brutal, though.  I look sad and ugly.  I'm so disappointed.  I'm so excited.  I woke up this morning, and I was like, yes, my pictures are on.  And they're, like, terrible. 
[00:06:00]  Really?  And I'm sick about it.  Well, that's what you look like.  But no, it's not.  Those are bad pictures.  How about you get another hot outfit and go to the Buffalo Station today and get a reshoot?  We like the reshoot.  Reshoot's always good.  Always good.  Well, see, then, obviously, my photographer sucks, though.  See what I'm saying?  You might want to ask someone else there to take the pictures.  You can't put any of the other ones on there.  All right, we will look for those other pictures.  We'll check with Columbo.  See if he got them.  We'll put every picture that was taken to you up.  The guy that's putting the pictures up on the website, he's under a lot of pressure. 
[00:06:30]  He's going through thousands of pictures at this point.  And, you know, maybe he rushed through your pictures to get home early.  So we'll take a look at the pictures and try to get more flattering photos up of you.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  Thank you, Leanne.  All right.  Obviously.  Hotter chicks sit in for her.  Obviously.  Oh, Rick.  She was very hot.  Obviously, the Naughty Naughty contest continues.  The qualifying continues.  We don't even know when the voting's going to start because this contest is way too cool.  Still, no one representing from Boston, Anthony. 
[00:07:00]  Uh-huh.  No one whatsoever.  What's up, Boston?  We're going to be up there Friday.  Friday, so.  No one.  The girls better make up for lost time on Friday.  What do you like?  Tell you that much.  Would you like the update, Ant?  Yeah, let's hear.  New York completely disappointing us at this point.  I don't think we've had a girl qualify in a week.  In a week.  Here in New York.  God damn.  And this is the easiest place to qualify.  Ladies, if you're in the area, you come by with the Naughty Naughty and you get your pictures taken.  You've got a chance to win a trip to Hedonism 3. 
[00:07:30]  Do we have a little incentive for a girl to come down today?  Yeah, what do we have?  What do we have?  We have, you know, tons of little knick-knacks.  We can put together a nice little prize package.  A little prize package.  All kinds of CDs, DVDs.  We have all kinds of stuff.  All right.  Come on, girls.  You'll get a little prize you come down.  A little incentive.  While the prizes last, we'll just give out stuff all day long for the ladies that show up here in New York.  Okay?  Here's the countdown.  Sacramento has one fine-looking piece of ass representing for the Naughty Naughty Contest. 
[00:08:00]  One girl has shown up at KXOA so far.  Do you have a number on her?  Which number she is?  Not offhand.  Oh, damn.  She's the one that you could almost see what she had for lunch.  Ah, yes.  Okay.  Do I have to explain any further?  No.  Okay.  Then in second-to-last place as far as women showing up to the station at, Buffalo with two representations.  Ah, Buffalo.  Uh, and, uh, next, and this is a nice surprise overnight, we got two more contestants from Washington, D.C., bringing the total up to three. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, one girl basically said, screw the Naughty Nighty, and she's practically naked through all of her pictures.  Yeah.  So, uh, go check that out if you haven't gone to opieandentony.com today yet.  I just checked them out for the first time about, uh, 15 minutes ago.  What's her name and what's the number?  We've got to give her props.  All right, we're looking at, I think it's number 30.  Uh, go to 37.  Seven.  Yeah, there you go.  From J.F.C.  37.  Picture two.  We have a winner. 
[00:09:00]  Stephanie.  We have a winner.  Stephanie, uh, from D.C., contestant 37.  Man, did she really...  God.  She put the contest in a whole new light.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  What a rack.  Look at picture three.  Let me go to three.  Let's go to three.  Look at her.  She's totally naked.  One.  Two.  She's barely covering up the bottom.  Nice.  Cans just hanging out.  But, and, officially, she's still in the Naughty 90 contest because she's holding the Naughty  90.  Right.  She's holding it against her body. 
[00:09:30]  Look at that.  Look at the last picture where she sprawled out on the console with those huge, delicious  jugs.  Just meaty cans.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  Who was the last girl attending the contest?  I don't think I've seen her pictures yet.  A girl named Mary or something?  From Washington.  She's from Washington.  Another one from Washington?  Yeah.  That's not bad.  Go all the way down.  Bad at all.  All the way down.  All the way down.  38.  38.  Oh, yeah.  She was pretty smoking, too.  Yeah.  So, the two girls that we got from Washington, D.C. overnight, very, very nice.  Yeah.  Very nice.  So, they got three girls representing in Washington, D.C. 
[00:10:00]  Anthony, New York, we only have eight contestants in the contest.  That's it.  Only eight.  Thank God we're syndicated, or this contest would be a bust at this point.  Cleveland has eight girls representing.  Yeah.  Which is very good, because, you know, they're way out there.  Right.  And then, still in first place, as far as girls showing up at the station, Philadelphia.  Yeah.  We like to call it Philly.  17 girls.  We do.  17 girls have shown up. 
[00:10:30]  17 girls.  Three of the contests so far.  And, ladies in the Philly area, you could show up today with your naughty 90s.  Someone standing by with the camera, right?  Yeah.  That means, out of all the cities in on this contest, San Francisco, which is no real surprise,  and Boston, no representation whatsoever yet from your few fine cities.  Yeah.  Completely letting us go to Boston.  Bastards.  The amount of trim we used to have marching through our studio when we were broadcasting live in Boston a few years back. 
[00:11:00]  Uh-huh.  And we can't get one girl for this contest?  Come on.  All right?  So, that's the deal.  And we'll continue qualifying today.  We have at least another week of qualifying, because this is starting to get good.  A week?  Well, we were ready.  Well, I said at least.  Because we were ready to, you know, stop the qualifying Friday after we go to Boston.  Uh-huh.  Oh, by the way, ladies, yeah, you can show up while we're there live Friday.  Oh, yeah.  At WBCN with your naughty 90s.  That's what we did for Philly, and they came out of the woodwork, so we're hoping the same thing happens in Boston Friday. 
[00:11:30]  We're pretty much going to, you know, stop the qualifying Friday, right?  Yeah.  But Washington, that chick from Washington put this whole contest in a whole new level.  Totally.  Whole new level.  That girl pulled out all the stops to try to win this contest.  Yeah.  And I do believe there's going to be a bunch of ladies going to follow her lead.  Right?  Yeah.  No, we check IDs.  Yeah, there was one there.  I'm like, wait a minute.  Anthony.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, listen, is number 35 under 12 category? 
[00:12:00]  No, we checked out her ID.  Her ID.  Yeah.  It looks like she got carjacked out of some old man's van.  All right, man.  She had some junk.  Hey, we don't like to mention numbers.  Yeah.  Right.  You guys can comment, and I think our listeners are smart enough to figure it out on their own.  Right.  Can I comment on this?  Islanders suck.  Oh, God.  Oh, the game is soft last night.  It's effing bad, and I need tickets for the Islander Raging game tonight at the Garden.  Someone help me out. 
[00:12:30]  You don't have tickets?  Do we have any connections for the Garden?  I need to go.  I need to go.  Oh, now I'm in a bad mood.  All right, let's go to Joe.  Did you miss the most exciting part of the game again last night?  Three goals in the first period.  You know, everyone knows I can only see the last two periods because I have to drive all the way to the Coliseum.  Yeah.  I get there.  One more goal scored, and the Islanders lose 3-1.  To the Devils.  Another very boring game as soon as I enter the Coliseum.  Don't.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, do the girls from D.C. get a bell curve? 
[00:13:00]  What do you mean a bell curve?  Do they get a curve since your ratings down here are kind of soft?  Oh, so that should be taken into consideration?  Yeah, I mean, you got three nice girls.  Compared to New York, you got eight.  Are you trying to say that the girls from D.C. are blowing away the girls from New York?  I would have to say yes.  Oh, no.  See New York.  See.  New York's letting us down.  Whatever.  See what you're doing to us.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  You're from New York. 
[00:13:30]  We can't.  Where are they?  The one girl, her pictures we just described, we can't fight against that.  That girl's blowing away.  Every girl that has shown up in New York so far.  So the question is, when are you all coming down here?  We wanted to be there tomorrow and Friday.  We wanted to be there tomorrow and Friday.  And for some reason they said, no, change of plans.  And they're not giving us a reason.  I know.  I don't get it.  Because everyone says we don't have listeners down there.  I know we have listeners in Washington, D.C.  We'll figure out something soon, all right?  All right.  All right, bro.  Come on. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, see, now the cities are going to start battling it out.  Andy.  Yo, boy.  Hey.  Just want to put it into perspective for you guys.  Listen.  All right.  Four Cleveland girls are worth one New York girl.  Have you taken a look at them?  Just keep that in mind, all right?  Well, I think they have.  Hang up on us New York guys.  We'll get them out to you.  Andy, I think they have a bad digital camera in Cleveland, though.  All the girls have devil eyes in Cleveland.  Yeah, they're all red-eye.  They got the red eyes working.  Tom from D.C.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, that girl Mary, the last one. 
[00:14:30]  I think her name is Mary 38.  Representing D.C.?  D.C.  Yeah.  She is.  She's a bomb.  I mean, she makes New York look bad.  See, New York.  See?  We can't even fight back.  We can't even fight back.  They're digging that.  I'm telling you, New York girls look all used up or something.  I don't know what's up with them.  Washington is Tyson.  New York is Chuck Webner at this point.  We can't even fight back.  Can't even fight back.  And you know what else?  I don't know where these Arbitron people are calling, but, you know,  everybody's talking about O&A down here. 
[00:15:00]  And the ratings should be higher than they are.  I don't understand it.  By the way, thank you, bro.  By the way, just because we don't read every instant feedback, trust me.  You entertain us all day long, guys.  I'm going to read this one.  Screw it.  All right.  So long, guys.  All right.  Dan from Cleveland writes, since Boston sucks so bad as far as this contest goes,  just give them number 21 to represent them.  Great. 
[00:15:30]  Awful.  All right.  So we need new girls to come down here today.  Brand new.  No reshoots.  None of these reshoots.  I'm sick of that.  You see a girl walking.  You're like, oh, we got a girl for this?  Oh, it's a reshoot.  Yeah.  Her hair is just different.  No reshoots, girls.  It's as good as you're getting.  Can I back up a bit?  What?  Amy representing for New York.  All right.  Let me.  I like punching up the.  Her reshoot pictures from yesterday? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  We'll put her right in the competition.  Definitely.  Let me see.  I forgot about her.  I forgot that the reshoot pictures came out really, really nice.  Really nice.  Great.  All right, Rick.  Third outfit.  And look at Rick's posing.  Look at Rick.  Wow.  That's so impressive on posing, though.  Oh, my God.  What is that I see in the last picture of the third set?  Last picture of the third set?  Yeah, look.  Look at what I see there.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I see baby bumpers. 
[00:16:30]  That's Kabul.  Yeah, that's pretty nice.  See that?  That's a weird pose, Rick.  Are you trying on a new pose?  No, I didn't take that one.  Stick to the basics, Rick.  Stick to the basics that you have tried and true.  You've honed your skills.  Stick to the basics.  You're trying to add a few more poses to your itinerary there.  Rick Cucciode.  Or I should say artillery.  All right.  All right.  Here you go.  Hey, Ant.  Yes.  I think we figured out how we're going to give away those tickets to the Super Bowl.  Uh-huh. 
[00:17:00]  When we go to Boston Friday.  Mm-hmm.  Now, hold on a minute.  You're going to love this.  Cindy.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I'm heading down to Cleveland now.  To join the Naughty Nighty contest?  I am.  Nice.  Can't wait to see you picture.  Don't count Cleveland out yet.  We're not counting anyone out.  We're counting New York out.  Yeah.  Right now?  Yeah.  We will say that.  We are counting New York out.  Eight girls have shown up for the contest.  We've been qualifying for a week and a half.  That's pathetic. 
[00:17:30]  If we weren't syndicated, this contest would be an embarrassment.  Oh, my God.  Because it's radio show.  That's because you should have done it in Cleveland.  You should have brought it to Cleveland.  Well, you guys are representing just fine.  Guys are doing a great job in Cleveland.  If you show up to the station today, Cindy, that means more girls showed up in Cleveland  than here in New York.  That's right.  All right.  Because Cleveland rocks, man.  Well, we look forward to seeing your pictures a little later on.  Okay, great.  Thanks, Cindy.  All righty.  Bye.  Uh, David, what's going on? 
[00:18:00]  Hello.  Hey, David, what's up?  Hello.  What's up?  Listen, I'm here to file a complaint.  All right, go ahead.  Uh, contestant number 25, Beth, the original contestant number 25.  Where is she?  We lost Beth.  25.  One of the girls pulled out of the contest?  Which one?  Was she hot?  I was ready to cast my vote, and now she's gone.  What?  What?  Oh, like, from Cleveland? 
[00:18:30]  There was a problem at the radio station that was there.  Well, you should announce it so no other ladies have the same problem.  Wait, wait.  Was it from Cleveland?  I don't know.  I thought it was Philly.  I didn't care where she was from.  What?  What, Steve?  Four chicks were pulled out of the contest.  At least that's what I just found out from Scott and John down the hall.  Any hot ones?  I think one of them might have been one of the real hotties.  Why?  Which one?  It's something, um, I don't know.  I think it might have been one of the chicks from Sacramento, or the chick from Sacramento 
[00:19:00]  might not have made it.  I'm not sure, though, so I don't want to, I don't want to say for sure.  Why?  There's something going on with their IDs.  Their forms weren't filled out.  They're not getting their IDs photocopied.  Oh, stop.  Yeah, we have to make sure we do this contest the right way, so.  Damn.  Sacramento might have lost their representation.  No, they're working on getting that problem.  I know a couple of them are working on getting the problem.  David, some of the girls will rejoin the contest.  We just have to make sure their papers are in order.  We need your papers to be in order. 
[00:19:30]  All right, David.  You guys rock.  All right, man.  Thank you.  What are you laughing at?  More comedy from instant feedback.  Look.  Look.  Look, I have no problem reading these, as long as the lady that is listening to, uh,  listening realizes that I'm just reading someone else's, uh, comment.  Okay?  This is, uh, Bensonhurst Johnny.  All right.  What was number 21 thinking when she put on that lace tablecloth? 
[00:20:00]  She should be in a Ram's uniform, blocking for Marshall Falk.  That fat effing pig.  Look, man.  Oh, my God.  Stop.  I think all the ladies are lovely.  Lovely in their own special way, Opie.  What was...  Huh?  Was that about a contestant?  Yeah.  I didn't, uh, see her.  Hey, Jim.  Are you with us today?  No, I just didn't know what that meant.  Have you seen number 21?  I haven't, no.  She's lovely. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Take a look at her pictures when we take a break, okay?  All right.  All right.  We have to take our first break.  When we come back, we'll explain how we're getting, uh, given, uh, the Super Bowl tickets.  Right.  It's going to be fun.  When we're live in Boston.  It's going to be a good old-fashioned contest, right, eh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We can play this.  Yeah, thank you, Aaron.  The naughty car cover contest.  Before we take a break...  Yeah.  ...don't hit the commercials yet.  Got a cute little skit.  A cute little skit, Anthony.  A cute little sketch. 
[00:21:00]  A little, little skit, little sketch.  A little sketch comedy.  Sometimes they're called bits in the biz.  Right.  Here's a cute little bit.  A cute little sketch.  Bit.  Skit.  All right.  Bit, skit, sketch, here it is.  It's coming to the Gay Channel.  What is up?  It's the second annual male group orgy competition.  And he hits the hole right after Jesse opens it up.  With your hosts, John Madden and Pat Summerall.  And then everyone's kind of slopping around down there and grunting and groaning. 
[00:21:30]  And, you know, you get mud and stuff flying and gang tackles and scrums and quagmires.  No fems, fats, or hairies.  Just the hunkiest gay studs and wild group action competition.  Nice to pack that guy around, too.  Don't get carried away, John.  There was all kinds of stuff flying around there.  It's male group sex to die for, as described by the best play-by-play team in the biz.  That was a late one.  That one didn't come and didn't come and didn't come and finally they threw it out of there. 
[00:22:00]  Boop.  I don't know where that one came from.  Look at that big old butt.  Whoa, what a meal those guys are having.  That look good.  That's a good group.  If you go nuts for tight butts.  You push, you push, you push.  Get Gaper View today.  He just rode him backwards.  Just put him right on his back.  With Pat Summerall and John Madden.  That looked like it was the last shot out of the Roman candle.  The second annual male group orgy competition on Gaper View.  Nice to pack that guy around, too. 
[00:22:30]  Floyd.  Yeah.  He's going to fire into his guy right here.  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE to order today.  Nah, okay.  What should we go with?  Hey, this is Steve-O and you're listening to the Opie and Andy Show.  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I?  All right.  Opie and Anthony Show?  And illegal street narcotics are keeping me alive.  Andy.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar are stopping by in a little while.  Four o'clock, I believe, from The Job on ABC. 
[00:23:00]  Tonight, 9.30.  Right.  I'm getting word that we have a brand new contestant in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Another girl from Washington, D.C.  Absolutely.  I hear her name is Sabrina.  Want to check out our pictures?  We have to refresh our browser, Opie.  And, yes, brand new contestant from Washington.  Let me get it down.  And there we go.  Take a look. 
[00:23:30]  Wait a minute.  Let me scroll down.  Let me go.  Here's the stick in the last picture.  Go to the last picture.  There we go.  Look at that.  We have to.  Come on.  I would do it.  I would definitely work that.  Wow.  Without a doubt.  Yeah?  Yes.  What?  I would definitely work that.  Without a doubt.  Wow.  Wow. 
[00:24:00]  Here's the fact, kid.  Oh.  No, man.  I'm telling you, no.  More nudity coming out of Washington, D.C., though.  Perhaps the photographer was at the wrong angle.  Yeah.  He should have been maybe down the hall.  Those heavy, natural cans.  That's nice, man.  Wow.  I bet.  Well, you know, to her credit, I bet she's got good upper body strength.  I don't even think Rick could fix that situation.  Rick, what would you do with that?  If you were the photographer, being the pro you are. 
[00:24:30]  The consummate professional.  She's probably a lovely lady, but that's definitely not my body type choice.  That's all.  That's all, John.  I would hit that in a second.  Dorton says he'll go there in a second.  Without a doubt.  Thick leg.  She's nice, man.  I'm telling you, she's not fat.  Don't say thick.  No, thick is nice.  It's feminine.  I don't think girls ever want to hear thick.  I don't care what they want to hear.  They never want to hear suck it or I'll shoot either, but.  All right.  All right.  So there you have it.  Our latest contestant in the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[00:25:00]  Mm-hmm.  That's like the fourth girl representing in Washington, D.C.  Come on, D.C.  Nice.  Very nice, right?  Oh, Anthony?  Yeah.  We have a pair of tickets to the Super Bowl.  Yes, we do.  We're going to be broadcasting live from WBCN in Boston.  Friday.  Friday.  We're coming up.  We encourage you guys to come hang out at the station with us.  Or at least on the sidewalk and, you know, we'll have microphones and we'll be bringing  people in and out all day long.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we have a pair of tickets to the Super Bowl. 
[00:25:30]  We don't have a way for you to get there and we don't have a place for you to stay, but  we do have the tickets.  Yeah, you have to work out your accommodations and travel to get to the Super Bowl.  In typical Opie and Anthony fashion.  Yeah.  Isn't that cheap?  We don't have tickets, but we do have a hat you can wear when you're scalping them.  Isn't that awful?  Ridiculous.  Isn't it sad?  We're a syndicated radio show, Jim.  Can't get anything done.  Ben, who's from Boston, you know, we spend a lot of time up there ourselves. 
[00:26:00]  Ben goes, it doesn't even matter, man.  Hardcore Pats fans, they don't care.  They get a pair of tickets, they're jumping in their ride and they're leaving.  Right.  Friday night, right after our show.  All right, look.  Boston has truly let us down as far as the Naughty Nighty contest goes, man.  Oh, my God.  They have truly let us down.  All right, look.  I don't want any of these girls mad at me.  I will read the instant feedback.  I just don't want the ladies thinking it came from my brain. 
[00:26:30]  All right, Ant?  Is that fair?  Yeah.  All right.  Nate from Boston.  Oh, I can't read that.  Let me see.  Nate from Boston.  Well, it does take care of the local reference for today.  For the Boston area.  Sabrina looks like the cow is at Hilltop on Route 1 in Saugus, Mass.  Thank you, Nate.  So, Ant, this is the deal. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  If we can't get three girls from Boston to represent the Naughty Nighty contest between now and the end of the show tomorrow.  Right.  Before we jump in our little cars and drive up to Boston.  Yeah.  We will, and ask Anthony, if I'm kidding, we will rip up the Super Bowl tickets on the air right at 7 tomorrow night.  Three girls have got to show up.  We need three girls between now and the end of tomorrow's show. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  Ask Anthony if I'm kidding.  No, no.  I know him.  Believe me.  He's not kidding.  You made us pull this out.  Incentive.  Come on, Boston.  Jesus Christ.  Not one, not two, three girls.  Between now and the end of the show tomorrow.  Yeah.  Help us out.  All right?  Speaking of the Super Bowl, remember yesterday we had Julie from New Orleans?  Yes.  Wanted to put up her house to the winners of the contest, but then she wanted to charge the guys and stuff. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And then a lot of outrageous Pat fans started yelling and screaming at Julie.  Calling her a hooah.  Well, now Julie's calling back because she's very distraught at the comments from yesterday.  Julie, what happened?  What's up with that?  What happened?  I forgot.  I mean, people were bashing me.  What's up with that?  I didn't say anything bad.  Well, because you were trying to make money off one of our fellow listeners here.  Well, I mean, you've got to think about it, though. 
[00:28:30]  If they want to stay at a hotel, which they probably don't.  No, no, no, Julie.  Nine times that you're not going to be able to do.  I forgive you because we haven't been on in New Orleans that long yet, but we try to take care of each other on this show.  I understand that.  We don't need, like, you charging $350 for people to stay at your house.  The nice thing would have been, hey, I've got a place.  I know someone might be, you know, struggling to try to figure it out.  If they win these tickets, they could stay with me. 
[00:29:00]  And then if the people from Boston feel like you gave them some hospitality and a good time, maybe they would throw you a little something.  $350 for how long?  For a night.  For a night.  For a night.  Wait, $350 for a night.  And now she's pissed because everyone yelled and screamed.  $350 for a night.  Right.  See, now you're reading me wrong.  How, how, wait, wait, let me ask you a question.  Jim, you missed the show yesterday.  Yes.  They get nothing.  They get nothing.  $350 just to sleep there?  Right.  We said, we said they should be able to watch her shower, watch her have sex, maybe, maybe have her have a job. 
[00:29:30]  Now, you see, people were calling, well, people were calling up after that, telling me I was a slut.  Well, yeah.  What's up with that?  I didn't say nothing incriminating, and I didn't say nothing bad.  Hey, man, we don't control our listeners, you know, that's.  Well, no, I understand that, and I'm not saying nothing about you.  Well, I'm saying you're a Cajun hooker.  $350 for a night is disgraceful.  Okay, well, you know what?  You could stay in a great hotel in Midtown.  Okay, well, you know what?  I will let somebody stay at my house for free, okay? 
[00:30:00]  Nah, it's too late now, because now we've got a couple other people that called, and they're willing to do it for free.  I know, I heard, I heard.  We didn't even have to, you know, force them or anything.  They just wanted to do it and take care of one of our listeners.  I think you're a little crazy, too.  The fact that you have small children in your household, that you would let a stranger come in, is a little odd.  A little odd.  Okay, well, you see, my husband, it was my husband's idea, okay?  Yeah, well, your husband's crazy, too.  And that's why I called.  Julie, it's not like everyone knows, no one knows where you live, so just cut your losses and move on. 
[00:30:30]  Well, that's exactly what I'm doing.  But you know what?  I am, like you said, you haven't been on New Orleans very long, and since you've been on, I have been a dedicated listener.  I enjoy listening to your show, and I think you guys are hilarious.  What are you?  I really do.  What, what?  But I'll never listen again, because the people from Boston are cool bastards, and they told me a whore.  I'm not holding anything against you guys.  I'm not holding anything against you guys.  Thank you.  For what?  Ah, there you go.  There's a, fine, how do you do? 
[00:31:00]  I'm picturing her at the other end of the phone line.  I'm not blaming you guys for it.  Hello?  Hello?  Son of a bitch.  They didn't hang up, did they?  This phone.  Kurt, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Last night.  Yeah.  Those two bags.  The one from Philly with her kid crying in the background on the cue off.  Oh, the queef off.  Yeah, the little queef contest.  Yeah, that must have been the funniest thing I think I've ever heard.  There was a little argument over queefs yesterday.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[00:31:30]  One girl did one, and another woman called up and said it sucked, and she did one.  And then we were comparing the two queefs.  One sounded like a nice, tight queef.  Right.  Sounded like a nice, high-pitched thing.  And the other one sounded like, I described it yesterday as letting truck tire air out through a London broil.  You know?  Something like that.  There's nothing like hearing good beef curtains flap in the window.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Rick, can we clean that up and get it on the air again? 
[00:32:00]  Because you guys missed a lot of it because they were cursing and just using the wrong terminology.  And she had her baby crying in the background.  She had to win.  Were that close to Van Halen now?  No, we were.  Oh, yesterday.  Yeah, yesterday we were very close to having Van Halen play for the new cities when we run out of dump.  All of a sudden, like a Van Halen record will pop on.  Yeah.  And we were very close yesterday.  So it might take Rick another day.  It's going to take a couple days.  Yeah, Rick's going to clean it up, and you'll get to hear all the stuff you missed when we were dumping out. 
[00:32:30]  So it was classic, though.  Thanks, Kurt.  Awesome, guys.  All right, man.  Later, bud.  All right.  People in Boston pissed off because we might rip up the tickets.  Nick, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  How's it hanging today?  All right.  First of all, are you crazy to rip up the Super Bowl tickets?  Are you out of your freaking gourd?  What?  Give them to one of the other cities and have people show up.  Even, you know, I'm from New York.  I'd love to take them, but, you know, we don't have any nice pangs showing up, so. 
[00:33:00]  What?  Like, hey, you know what?  Do you have people showing up, and maybe they want some tickets?  Don't rip them up.  Are you crazy?  You should be shot.  It's punishment.  Maybe we should have a fine listener from New York go.  Oh, that would piss off Boston.  That would piss off Boston.  Even more than ripping them up.  Just say, whoever has, whatever city has the most people show up in the next two days, one of the listeners from that city gets to go.  I like ripping it up.  Yeah.  I like going right for the heart. 
[00:33:30]  It's Mardi Gras.  It's Mardi Gras down there, boys.  You get to have more wilds down there during the Super Bowl than you ever want.  See, other people like to, like, rip the wings off the fly and let them live for a while.  I like how to just go for it, man.  Go for the gusto.  Right.  No, it's Mardi Gras down there, guys.  You can have as many wild signs as you want in the middle of Bourbon Street.  We'll have to think it over.  No, we're ripping them up.  We've got to rip them up.  I think New York and all the other cities will completely understand.  Come on, precious. 
[00:34:00]  Do that.  All right.  No, that's the deal, though.  We need three girls to show up for the Naughty Nighty Contest in Boston between now and the end of the show tomorrow,  or we rip up the tickets live on our show.  Would it piss Boston off more ripping them off or just calling someone random in St. Louis and giving someone in St. Louis the tickets?  Oh, that's good, too.  Just call up a random place and go, hey, you want to go to the Super Bowl?  We'll FedEx the tickets to you.  There you go.  You're going.  Hey, you reminded me of an old prank from the O&A archives. 
[00:34:30]  Which one?  The cheesehead guy.  Oh, we got something to play for you in a minute.  This is the last time.  Yeah, that was the last time the Pats were in the Super Bowl.  Doc, what's up?  Ouch.  Hey, guys, you know how you were just talking about that filthy treglet bite from D.C. that sent in the pictures?  I know how to fix that problem.  Well, she's our latest contestant.  Well, you know, I'd rather cut my mule off and feed it to a donkey before looking at that again.  Oh, stop.  I'd like to see the girls you're with.  Well, I never said I was a winner or anything.  I'm a complete and pathetic loser. 
[00:35:00]  But I'm like Andrew Dice Clay.  I still have my hair.  Talk to you later.  Dude, she's not bad.  Norton's really digging her.  I'm telling you, you guys are giving her a hard time for what?  She's got, she's like, she's not like a tiny girl, but she's not like really a huge girl.  She's definitely workable, man.  Nick, what's up?  Owen A, how are you?  Hey.  Listen, guys, I would pay a thousand bucks a night to see that receptacle mother hang herself.  I'll go there.  Please, she's, doesn't she realize on how many levels she's an idiot for what she called and asked for yesterday? 
[00:35:30]  And she doesn't even realize that you should just cut your losses.  Now she's calling back today because she's upset about what happened yesterday.  That's only going to, you know, encourage you guys more.  It fuels the fire.  It fuels the fire.  It fuels the garbage.  All right.  Thank you, Nick.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Now, Elizabeth brings up a very good point here.  Elizabeth.  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Tell them to shut up.  They're ruining it. 
[00:36:00]  Who, what?  All of them.  All the instant feedback.  This happens to you guys every time.  Oh, you are absolutely right.  All the girls don't show up because all the stupid guys open their big mouth.  Start criticizing a little too much.  You're right.  You're right.  We've been giving a lot of the girls some major props.  Major lead props.  I know that, too.  But you always seem to have the ones that have been around too long in New York.  Maybe they've been around listening too long and they've seen what goes on sometimes when  the girls show up.  That makes a good point, Anthony. 
[00:36:30]  Maybe we should be a little softer.  Maybe we should continue commenting, but we'll just leave out the numbers.  Right.  Leave the goddamn numbers and names out.  That's right.  Because then people can kind of figure it out on their own who we're talking about.  Exactly.  Great.  All right.  You've got to be kinder and gentler, you know?  All right, Elizabeth.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Although you could comment in a good way on people.  Like someone just commented that Melanie, Contestant 3, Teen Melanie.  Teen Melanie rocks.  Looks like JonBenet Ramsey would look if she grew up. 
[00:37:00]  I like that.  Good look, right?  Doesn't she look?  Look at that.  Where's the little cowboy hat?  Cindy.  Oh, is that nice?  Cindy or Cynthia?  Yeah, Finn.  Call me Finn.  Hey, Finn.  Are you guys on crack?  You going to rip up Super Bowl tickets?  Well, we got...  Yeah, because Boston has let us down.  There are plenty of other people that want them.  Why should we do a favor of someone in Boston if Boston's not helping out the show?  It's no secret that Ann and I made our names in Boston radio. 
[00:37:30]  It's no secret that we entertained Boston for many, many years.  They can't help us out with a stupid little Naughty Nighty contest.  We're embarrassed.  People always will let you down.  Be selfish.  Sell their tickets and pocket the cash.  We're just hoping that this rallies the troops up in Boston.  Where's some of our old girl pals from up there from Matthews?  I thought you were going to say you.  All right.  Where's some of our old whores from up there?  Where's some of the girls we used to pour Boston baked beans all over? 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Where are you?  Yeah, where's the bean girl?  Where's the goddamn girls from Tans or Matthews?  Where are the girls from...  What was that, Bill?  Oh, where are the...  A realvideo.com or whatever it was.  Where are the Kahlua girls?  Oh, the Kahlua girls.  With the half shirts.  I guess all your old girls probably died of venereal diseases.  Come on.  Where are the ladies?  Where are they all?  I told you they all died of the class.  No.  Stop.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  Thank you, Sid.  Peace.  You know, Tony has a really good idea.  And it goes with our idea so we can maybe adjust it.  Tony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Norton, you sick freak.  Hello, sir.  Love you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Guys, you really want to go for the throat?  Yeah.  Let Pharrell have his way with those tickets.  That'll piss them off.  All right.  I'll get them off their asses.  We have just up the ante.  If three girls don't show up for the Naughty Naughty Contest in Boston between now and the  end of the show tomorrow, we will have Scott Pharrell right around 7 o'clock tomorrow night 
[00:39:00]  rip up the Super Bowl tickets.  Yeah.  And we know how you guys love Scott Pharrell up in Boston.  Oh, that will be really bad.  Girls better show up.  Jared, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  All right.  So I'm not going to name any numbers.  I'm not going to name any names.  But I just checked out the latest picture of the Naughty Naughty Contest.  And I might be wrong, but I think I saw her helping a man push a couch into the back 
[00:39:30]  of a van last week.  Comment?  Anybody?  Ah, nice.  I'm hanging up.  Very nice Silence of the Lambs reference.  Am I correct?  I have my top five picked out.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  I'll tell you what.  That one girl from Washington is definitely in my top five.  Oh, one of the ones.  Bobby from Philly is definitely in my top five.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Bobby's in my top five, too.  This chick from JFK. 
[00:40:00]  Which one?  Turn it around.  This one.  I love her, though.  Isn't that great?  No, I'm saying that.  That is really good.  That's the same one that's in my top five.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at this shot.  It's like, dude, come on.  That's beautiful.  She's in.  Washington representing.  Alex, what's up?  Okay.  I'm from Boston.  Yes.  And if I go down between today and tomorrow, will you give me something for being the first 
[00:40:30]  girl to do it?  Yes.  All right.  Whatever it takes.  That's a good incentive, sure.  Because I'm not going to lie to you.  We don't really want to rip up the Super Bowl tickets, but God damn it, we will.  What will you give me?  We'll figure it out.  I'll tell you this much.  WBCN has the best prizes as far as all the syndicated cities.  Okay.  It's unbelievable what they have to give away up there.  Yes.  We usually steal half the stuff when we broadcast from Boston.  They pull stuff out of the secret room up there.  It's great.  I think you get to do cocaine off the turntables in the secret room as you win stolen CDs. 
[00:41:00]  No thanks.  I had so many stolen CDs in my truck on the way home, man.  I can barely drive the car.  Isn't it great?  Okay.  Well, will you make it good?  Secret room.  We will make it good, Alex.  Thank you.  Make sure the station calls us when you show up, okay?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Maybe we've got something going on.  Fine.  Yeah.  Hopefully.  Deb, what's up?  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how you're actually going to win the tickets.  Oh, we haven't said that. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  No.  I realize if we don't show up, they're getting torn up, but I'm not going to show up just  to save them.  I have confidence.  I'm not going to get them.  You know, I feel bad we had to pull this out of our bag of tricks, but I have confidence  in Boston that it'll now be taken care of.  See, Deb brings up the point, though.  She goes, I'm not showing up if I'm not getting the tickets.  That's not the point.  The point is, you'll be in a contest that might get you a trip to hedonism, too.  Three.  I'd give up hedonism for the Patriots. 
[00:42:00]  Well, don't worry about it.  Just show up.  Well, I'm worried about it.  See, the city's got, you know, you're one.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  It doesn't really matter that you don't officially win the Super Bowl tickets.  It's that you just saved the tickets from being ripped up so one of your fellow people  from Boston can go on and wash as the other.  It's like all the nepotism up there.  You all take care of each other.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right?  All right, thanks.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  Here's another girl on her way to the station in Cleveland.  See what's going on here.  Kristen.  Yes, yes.  Hi.  Hi.  You're on your way to Extreme Radio.  I sure am.  All right, cool.  Well, we look forward to seeing your pictures.  Are you hot?  I'm hotter than the girls from Cleveland that I've seen, and I know there are some hotter  girls out there.  I don't know where they are, but they are not on your website.  What are you kidding?  There's some beauties on there.  From Cleveland?  Oh, I know there's more hot girls than that in Cleveland.  I like the representation from Cleveland.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  The devil eyes are throwing me off a little bit.  We're going to kick ass.  I'm telling you.  All right, Kristen.  We'll see you soon.  All right.  We can't wait to see your pictures.  Call us after the pictures are posted.  Okay.  All right, good.  All right, bye-bye.  She's got quite a few dishes in Cleveland.  Dish.  She's quite a dish.  Nice pegs.  Should we announce how we're giving away the Super Bowl tickets?  Yeah.  If we have them to give away when we broadcast live from Boston Friday?  Yes.  I think we're going to go with a good old-fashioned puking contest. 
[00:43:30]  Good old-fashioned puke fest.  Yeah.  People seem to enjoy puking.  And it gets the guys involved.  We weren't going to tell you what we were going to do and have everyone show up at the station and then decide.  But we've got to weed out the wimps.  Yeah.  This is going to be a good old-fashioned puking contest.  It's got to be hardcore.  It can't just be luck.  If it's luck, somebody might win that doesn't really want to go.  If you participate in this event, you're really going to want to see the Super Bowl. 
[00:44:00]  That's right.  A lot of fraternities up in the Boston area.  Yeah.  Do we have a wacky, goofy name for it or anything yet?  No, we could probably come up with something.  Yeah.  The listeners will come up with something.  After all, they're our head writers for the Opioid Act.  That is true.  We don't have to pay anyone.  All right.  But we are going to hold a lottery outside the station.  Yeah.  Basically, you show up at the station and you could...  Well, there's a few things you've got to realize here.  We have the tickets, but we have no transportation and we have nowhere for you to stay. 
[00:44:30]  If that's cool and you'll worry about it after you win the tickets, whatever.  That's the first hurdle.  Second hurdle, you've got to be tough enough to survive the contest.  Yeah.  Okay.  Then you show up at the station.  Here's the initial hurdle.  We'll give everyone numbers and then we're going to pick numbers out of the hat.  We're going to pick ten people to participate in the good old-fashioned puking contest.  Uh-huh.  You want to take it from here, Anthony? 
[00:45:00]  Well, those ten people will be whisked away into the BCN studios.  Mm-hmm.  Where we will have buckets and tarps galore.  All over the studio.  Then, uh, here's the contest.  We're going to tie it in to the Pats being in the Super Bowl with good old-fashioned New England clam chowder.  Mm-mm-mm.  White and milky.  I love it.  White, creamy clam chowder. 
[00:45:30]  Big chunks of potatoes and big chunks of clam all in that creamy, white, saucy soup.  Mm.  Now, what you guys will do is eat a big bowl.  Oh, no.  Maybe we can call it a Super Bowl.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  A big bowl of this clam chowder.  All ten years. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  Uh, which will be followed in ten short minutes by another big bowl of creamy, clammy chowder.  And ten minutes after that, yet another Super Bowl of glingling clam chowder.  Uh, and by this point, people will be vomiting up the creamy clam chowder into the bucket, at which point you're done skiing.  Right.  Out.  The last person that pukes will be, uh, going to the Super Bowl. 
[00:46:30]  That's right.  We'll get tickets to the Super Bowl.  That's right.  Okay, there it is, our Super Bowl of clam chowder puke fest contest.  So do your, um, do yourself a favor, and if you're a wimp, do not try to, uh, join this contest.  This is better than any of the, uh, drinking contests that have been done, that we have done.  Right.  Uh, where we have people drinking water, booze, or whatnot. 
[00:47:00]  Even the milk contest was, uh, not as bad as this.  Chunky, creamy, thick, and filling clam chowder.  How the hell are you even going to get through two bowls?  You know what would really spice it up, too, if you threw toilet sheets over the head and gave them, like, a slap-happy type tagging?  Right before they, blah, blah.  Why?  Uh, Mike, what's up?  Hey, I got a name for it.  Yeah.  Just call it the puker bowl. 
[00:47:30]  The puker bowl.  The puker bowl.  That's not a bad idea, man.  Very good.  All right, man.  Sully calling in with the name for the contest.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Sully!  I got one that, uh, it's called Yak for the Pat.  Yeah.  It's not quite there yet, though.  I know it's, it's not as good as run around the park after Aaron.  Yeah, I love that.  We were going to try to do that contest in Boston, but, uh, we decided, ah, we don't want to spend, uh, the weekend in jail in Boston.  It's a good idea.  All right.  I'll talk to you later, Pickle Sniffers.  All right.  Uh, Frenchie wants to. 
[00:48:00]  Looks like a pork rind and a nightie.  Frenchie.  All right, Malcolm.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just want to know if you want me to bring, bring some, uh, French delicacy on Friday.  No, we figured out the contest.  No, no, we figured it out there, Frenchie.  All right, because I had, uh, some, uh, lamb head in stock.  No, we, much like victory in Europe, you won't be needed, Frenchie.  Son of a bitch, huh?  Goddamn Italian.  Someone picked up on a great line yesterday.  Frenchie, we were asking him if he could find some guts, and Frenchie goes, yeah, I think 
[00:48:30]  I could find some guts.  I can find anything.  And, uh, this guy, this guy writes in, it took 60 years for a Frenchman to find guts.  Yeah, well, we'll go around the corner and find them.  Best line of the day that never was read on the air yesterday, because we ran out of  time.  All right, Frenchie.  All right, take it easy, guys.  You twat.  Yeah, you're all back.  All right, there we go.  This little snail-eating sissy boy.  We're proud of ourselves.  Look at that escogol.  All right.  Get it.  We're proud of ourselves.  We spent at least five minutes trying to figure out how to give, uh, the Super Bowl 
[00:49:00]  time.  At least.  I know.  Showing that we do, indeed, show prep.  We toiled for in the ones of minutes.  Well, we had to watch the CIVO video.  What's more important?  We had more important things to do.  So, does everyone get the contest?  As long as we have the tickets still.  It's that bruise on our arm from guys touching our 10-foot poles.  I'm not saying names and numbers.  Come on.  I'm being fair.  What a bunch of creeps everyone is. 
[00:49:30]  The Vomit Palooza?  No.  No.  The Chowder Chunk Challenge.  The Chowder Chunk Challenge.  The Super Blow Chunk Challenge.  I can't wait to get the video.  Puking, always funny.  I don't care how old you are, man.  We were watching the Steve-O video.  Eating the possum still.  And Steve-O was eating the possum.  And he puts a little bit in his nose.  He's just barely chomping down with his front teeth.  He makes a face like, uh-oh, here it comes.  It just does go.  And he's doing that sound. 
[00:50:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Lenny.  Hey, what's up?  It's Lenny.  Hey, Lenny.  Hey, what's going on?  I want to know if extra zaniness, you got to spell Super Bowl?  S-O-U-P-E-R?  Super Bowl.  Be good, guys.  We're doing the Super Bowl.  Very good, bro.  That's funny.  That's wax-zain-erific.  So there you have it.  A good old-fashioned.  Yeah.  Puke fest. 
[00:50:30]  Puking contest.  But it does separate the people that are like, well, I wish I'd win that or something,  to the people that really are willing to work for it.  Yeah, so.  All right?  Yes.  We're going to need a lot of clam chowder.  So, basically, you got to get your asses to the WBCN studios or outside there on the sidewalk  where a lot of people hang every Wednesday.  Yep.  And get there by three, and we'll hand out numbers, and we'll have some hot girl pick  numbers from a hat, and you guys will be, you know, brought into the studio, and then 
[00:51:00]  the puking contest will begin.  She looks like she ate the three-course Willy Wonka gum and just hit the blueberry pie dessert.  All right, well, you'll have to figure out who it is.  Frankie wants to spice up the contest here.  Frankie!  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a great little twist for yous.  All right.  You ever mix milk and orange juice together?  Uh-huh.  Well, you should have them drink a big glass of orange juice in between every bowl of clam 
[00:51:30]  chowder.  Well, we're confident that you're eating a bowl of chowder every ten minutes.  It's not going to take much time.  You're going to dump.  No, you'll be surprised how much quicker people will start blowing chunks.  Well, maybe if they were in Miami or something like that.  Some orange growing place.  Right, right.  But it doesn't really apply.  All right.  I mean, the other thing, too, is you're going to be on the clock, so if you don't finish  your bowl of chowder, then you're out of the contest as well.  Mm-hmm.  Or how about in between every bowl, they have to watch a clip of Voss's act?  Oh, stop now.  That's too cruel. 
[00:52:00]  He's not even here to defend himself.  He never is.  I hate when that happens.  I wonder where he is.  I know where he isn't, writing new material.  Teen Shannon checking in from Cleveland.  Teen Shannon, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hi.  I just want to tell you guys, I'm going down for a race shoot.  Oh.  I don't know if I'm going today because I'm at work and I work late, but my pictures  did me no justice.  Why is that?  Let me pop your pictures up.  Look at you.  You're a little cutie.  Yeah, I look like a little pig.  What? 
[00:52:30]  Wait, hold on.  Let's go to Teen Shannon.  I don't like them, so I'm going down for a race shoot and I'll show a little more skin  this time.  Are you kind of, though?  You kind of look like Winnie Cooper if she ate Kevin Arnold.  Everybody tells me I look like Winnie.  Ben, go up.  I saw you.  Really?  They do?  Yes, everybody.  What number are you, 11?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  Go to 11.  Yeah, she's 11.  I wouldn't mind seeing a shot of your dumper, though.  Yeah, I have a nice one, I swear.  Oh, you're the one in the pink?  Yes.  I like you.  You like me?  Yeah.  Well, thank you. 
[00:53:00]  They only took two pictures, though.  That's not a good sign.  Yeah, that's not promising.  That's never a good sign.  That's never a good sign.  What?  You look a little chubbier than you would like to?  Yeah.  Well, because the pink thing, you know how it, like, flows off of my butt?  Because my butt's bigger, so it looks like I have a fat.  I don't know.  You know what you've got to do?  What?  For your reshoot.  Get in something severe.  Something that shows your midsection and some kind of little panty thing for you.  Yeah, I think I'm going to wear my, um, black.  I think I'm going to, I have a, I have really hot underwear to wear, and I want to see if 
[00:53:30]  they'll let me change it into a few different things.  Because you've got a great, uh, you know, sex in the janitor closet at the junior high look  on your face there.  Your face is beautiful.  Thank you.  Absolutely beautiful.  Yeah, and I mean, what are the girls from Cleveland doing?  There's way beautiful girls here, and nobody's going down, I mean.  Man, Cleveland's a competitive city, we're starting to find out.  Yeah.  We are, and there's such beautiful girls here, there really is.  And New York, you know, you've been on the air an hour, and not one girl's coming here 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, I don't know what they're doing in New York.  Okay.  You guys are crazy, you guys got to get down there, but.  You know what's going to happen?  A girl from New York's going to walk through that door, we're going to punch a square in the  face.  Yeah.  Why the F, where were you, bitch?  Yes.  Who were you with?  Where have you?  Bitch!  You've been hanging with the girls from Philly!  Um, but yeah, look for pictures.  We can't wait.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right, Ed?  Yeah.  Let's play this little prank that we did a few years back, it's off our CD, Dementor World. 
[00:54:30]  A CD that we encourage you don't buy.  It's a spuper ball.  That's cute.  Because the guy that put it out is a douchebag.  He wasn't always a douchebag, but he decided to be a douchebag for whatever reason.  And decided he didn't want to, like, sell these CDs, knowing we were going to be syndicated  all over the country.  Scumbag.  Scumbag, yes.  It was when the Pats were in the Super Bowl with the Packers there. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, Green Bay.  And you and I pretended that we had a pair of tickets to give away, and we were like  a local TV station, I think.  That was a wacky, kind of wacky thing we were doing.  So we randomly called a pizza parlor.  Yeah.  And check this out.  Hello?  Hello, Art Bowling!  Uh, wrong number.  Really?  Yeah.  What number did we call?  Sammy's Pizza.  Oh, we were trying to give away Super Bowl tickets to Art Bowling.  Well, give them to me.  What do you think?  It's a little unorthodox.  Am I going or no?  Let's hear how excited you would get. 
[00:55:30]  You sound excited.  You just might be going to the Super Bowl.  No way.  We might go to the Super Bowl.  Go Packers!  Do you have a co-worker there, sir?  Oh, sure.  Okay, give her the phone.  Okay.  Hello?  Hi, how are you?  I'm good, how are you?  Good, we're going to give that guy tickets to the Super Bowl, but we're going to make him  do something really stupid for him.  Okay.  All right, tell him he's got it stripped out to his underwear right now.  You've got it stripped to your underwear right now.  Go! 
[00:56:00]  Hey, that's underwear.  Tell him this is a radio station in Green Bay.  This is a radio station in Green Bay.  We've got green and gold boxers on.  Really?  Really.  Did he take his shirt off, too?  No.  Tell him to take his shirt off.  Take your shirt off.  That's a shirt off.  Because if you look out the window, we actually have somebody seeing if he's doing all this.  Open your blinds.  This will all come clear in a few minutes.  We're going to have someone run into the pizza parlor with the tickets. 
[00:56:30]  Someone's going to be running into the pizza parlor with the tickets to make sure you did this.  And we're filming it for the TV station.  We're filming it for the TV station.  What is he down to?  His boxers?  He's down to his boxers.  And you guys work at a pizza place?  He's working at the pizza place.  Can you take a couple of those pepperonis and put them on his nipples?  We want to make them look really silly for the 5 o'clock news tonight.  Can we put pepperonis on your nipples for the 5 o'clock news?  We have our man in the street, Brad Force, is going to be running in with Super Bowl tickets.  And if he looks exactly like we have him set up to look, he will be going to the Super Bowl. 
[00:57:00]  He has to have the pepperoni on?  Pepperoni.  Pepperoni on.  All right, we'll work on it.  Well, hurry up.  Okay.  This is all going down as we speak.  This is unbelievable.  I'm not kidding.  This is it right now.  Does he have the pepperoni on his nipples or not?  Just about.  He's got it.  He's running with the pepperoni.  Take some cheese and sprinkle it on his head.  We want to come in and see a cheese head.  Okay, hold on just a second.  Paul, you've got to have cheese and sprinkle it on your head.  He needs pepperoni on his nipples. 
[00:57:30]  Don't forget the cheese on his head.  Okay, we won't forget the cheese.  Put it on your head.  Hurry up.  Sprinkle some cheese because he's got to be a cheese head.  He's got to be a cheese head.  Okay.  Okay, we got the cheese.  All right, ma'am.  Now explain what he looks like right now.  Okay, we got green and gold boxers.  Okay.  We got pepperoni on the nipples.  Okay.  And cheese on the head.  Very good.  All right.  This is what I need him to do.  This is going to be unbelievable.  We're waiting outside with the TV cameras.  He needs to run outside right now.  You're waiting outside with the TV cameras.  You need to run outside right now.  As soon as he runs onto the sidewalk, the God Force will hand him his Super Bowl tickets. 
[00:58:00]  Okay, as soon as you walk outside looking like that, you will get handed Super Bowl tickets.  And beyond the 5 o'clock news.  And beyond the 5 o'clock news.  Is he outside?  You know, it's pretty cold out there.  We know that.  That's why we're making him do this.  It's going to make great TV.  Now, is he outside?  You bet.  All right, go get the dork from outside.  We got to talk to him.  This is going to be brutal.  Hello?  Okay, so you were outside with pepperoni on your nipples, cheese on your head, in your box of shorts. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Did you see any TV cameras?  No, I didn't.  Sucker!  Sucker!  Let them hang like the animals they are.  Hey, we're back with the O&A show.  Let's get the party started, Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  Yes.  Look who's to our left.  Adam Farrar and, of course, Dennis Leary from The Job.  Good job.  How are you?  It's very good.  It's on tonight at 9.30.  That's right.  Everyone's checking out the show just to see the wow sticker.  Yeah.  Yeah, isn't that great?  I can't tell you how much email we've gotten over that.  Really?  Oh, hundreds upon hundreds of emails.  Yeah, I don't think we couldn't possibly get a better product placement unless he wore it on his ass.  I know.  Well, we were hoping for that one.  Yeah, last week, the opening shot, it's got you and Adam in the shot, and right between you, glowing, 
[00:59:30]  oh, this big friggin' wow.  Yeah.  How did this clown get that?  I'm going to say I walked in that he had put that up.  I went, that's unbelievable.  That's like right out in the open.  He's like, yeah, it's going to be in every shot.  I was like, okay.  Fine with me.  That's a pal.  I'm going to start selling the space on the side of my desk.  Yeah, exactly.  You probably could, man.  Yeah, you could.  We're waiting for the bill.  Well, now you've got to just get an Opie and Anthony sticker that, you know, just... 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I'll put that on my desk.  Will you?  Sure.  See, he's going to help you out.  If you do smoke, please try call.  Yeah, what kind of cigarettes are going to be smoked?  I saw these new cigarettes the other day in the store.  You've seen these USA cigarettes?  Talk about capitalizing on 9-11, right?  Are you kidding?  Car companies are doing, you know, you've seen all the commercials, you know, with the  flags waving and everything else.  There's a brand of cigarettes called USA, and they come in three different kinds, you  know, regular and then mild and ultralight, whatever, and they have the flag right  on the cover of them.  I was like, come on, guys.  Jesus Christ.  You know?  I hate that. 
[01:00:30]  The story just came out that some company bought a bunch of iron, scrap iron from the  trade center.  Oh, that's a good thing today.  Yeah.  And they're melting it down, making them into commemorative medallions.  Not even the whole thing.  25% of it is going to be metal from the World Trade Center.  The other is going to be, you know, aluminum cans and whatnot.  And then they're selling them.  And here's their line, since they've been getting so much flack from family members and  whatnot.  They say, well, the company itself has lost a lot of work since 9-11. 
[01:01:00]  This is a way to prevent the layoffs in the company.  Wow.  Slimey, slimey son of a bitch.  Right.  $29.95.  Exactly.  Was the guy sitting on his tail when he was doing that interview?  I know.  Some of the survivors, family members, said, this is ghoulish.  Yeah, it really is.  That my loved one hasn't been found yet, and this company is hawking medallions.  Like the ones you see on TV, you know, commemorating Groundhog Day from the Franklin Mint. 
[01:01:30]  And it's just this cheesy, badly pressed coin.  The George W. Bush coin.  This nerd with a magnifying glass.  I would be proud to have this in my collection.  Get out of here.  Order now and get the bamboo steamer.  You know, I smoke USA cigarettes because I'm patriotic.  That's what it is.  What are you doing?  Blow that smoke towards Afghanistan.  And then the people are complaining now that the cops cracked down on the sales of NYPD  and FDNY merchandise.  Well, I'm actually for that. 
[01:02:00]  I think that's a good idea.  The crackdown?  Hell yeah.  If you're going to raise money, you know, for the fire department or something,  by selling these hats and these T-shirts.  But you got, like, my brother-in-law said to me last time I saw him, he goes,  look at this, FDNY hat.  I said, where'd you get that?  He goes, I got it off the street.  Five bucks.  And I was like, great.  It's not even a real hat.  No.  It's not a real hat.  He's wearing it proudly, though.  And he's smoking USA cigarettes.  Because, you know, I want to support my country.  Let's crop some USA cigarettes on the AFK.  You know, I just don't like the idea of walking downtown.  I don't know if they're still doing it down there, but all the pictures of the Trade Center 
[01:02:30]  that is on there.  All around the garden, they're still doing it.  It's gum.  The guy that's selling it, believe me, looks exactly like what was the windshield of the  plane before it hit.  Yeah.  I'm really not appreciative of the fact that the people from probably the same country,  at least nearby.  The terrorists.  Yeah.  The terrorists.  Thank you, Dennis.  They're all over.  The terrorists.  They're selling pictures of the Twin Towers.  See, it's a good thing I'm not a cop or an FBI agent, because I just round these guys  up right now.  I put them in Giant Stadium.  Yeah.  Just hold them, you know.  Round them up.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Get a big catapult and shoot them into the ocean.  Let them swim home.  That's what I would do.  The one J in your name, you're coming with us.  Yep.  Bye-bye.  They were selling pictures of the towers on fire for a while.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the big explosion coming out the side.  It's also off the street.  I was just, I walked by in disgust.  If I open my mouth, I'll freak out, so I don't say anything.  But it's just, people are slowly, they said, hey, we've got to get America back to normal,  back to the way we were.  Get the normalcy.  There it is.  Capitalizing on a disaster.  Yeah, yeah.  We've commented so many times on the goddamn Titanic slide that are at the kids' parties. 
[01:03:30]  You ever see this thing?  It's a huge blow-up Titanic that it looks like it's sinking into your lawn, and the kids  climb up and slide down.  Yeah, baby.  And bounce off the big inflatable day.  That's entertainment.  It's like, how much time has to go by before a tragedy that killed thousands is now a carnival  ride?  Unbelievable.  It doesn't matter.  Daddy, take me on the Hindenburg.  I want to go on the Hindenburg.  Yeah.  All right, son.  Get on.  Unbelievable.  It doesn't take long before we get back to normal.  He's tall enough to ride the Holocaust coaster. 
[01:04:00]  He's so awful, isn't he?  Jesus, Adam.  Go ahead.  It's all right.  Put that right in, the Arthur Ashe doll.  You're not right, man.  I've got to interrupt for a second.  Andy in Philly has something to say.  Andy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  I've got Cindy in the studio here, guys.  All right.  She showed up.  Yeah, she's here.  And she's sitting right across from me, and she's smoking, man.  She's hot, huh?  Cindy, say hi to the guys.  Hi, guys.  Hey, you want to say hi to Dennis Leary?  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Hi, Cindy.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Hey, Andy, that's not saying much, because Dennis Leary's smoking right here, too, and  I don't want to see him in a night.  Hey, put him on the website, man.  Literally.  Put him on the phone, man.  Is she cute?  Yeah, she's really cute.  Really cute.  I got two thumbs up just down here, and I'm all nervous.  You're all nervous?  All nervous?  All right.  Smoke an American cigarette.  It'll calm you down.  Have a USA cigarette.  We got the pictures on the way, man.  Why are you so nervous, though?  She's that hot?  Yes.  Really?  Can't wait to see the pictures now.  Yeah, yeah.  Once you guys get the pictures, you'll be thinking what I'm thinking. 
[01:05:00]  You're kind of stuttering, too.  Just calm down now.  Calm down.  Andy, sometimes you lie.  Hey, I'm not lying.  Okay.  He has lied in the past.  He has, yeah.  We've asked, hey, is she hot?  He said that as far as every girl that's stopped by.  Technology is great, because he'll take pictures of this girl.  We'll have them up on the website.  But is he one of these guys just happy to have a girl in the room?  No, no.  He sounds it.  No, absolutely not.  No, no.  You're still stuttering.  He sounds it sometimes.  It's not a fact that I'm in.  All right, listen.  I got a hot chick in front of me.  Dennis Leary on the phone.  Obi and Anthony, I'm sorry.  I'm just going nuts. 
[01:05:30]  Now, what is she?  Like a nine, an eight?  You know what?  I'd have to go 8.99.  8.99?  Nice.  Let's just say nine and get it over with.  I know.  8.99.  Let's round up, right?  Come on.  Where's the flaw that's a .001 that's keeping her from being a nine?  What is it?  Simple on the ass?  What is it?  Come on.  That's at least a .1, not a .001.  She was an 8.9, but he was stuttering.  It was an 8.99.  No, no, no.  I'm not.  That's not a nine.  All right.  I love you guys, man.  You guys are the best.  All right.  We look forward to seeing the pictures.  They're on the way, man.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Later.  That guy is one second away from just braining her with a hammer and assaulting her.  Maybe.  He really sounds a little.  Who is that guy?  He's a board op from our station in Philly.  You know, in Philly, I heard that they're banning the cops from smoking.  No, are they?  Yeah.  They're going to put this rule in effect in a couple of weeks that the cops are no longer  allowed to smoke.  On the job?  On the job.  They'll be able to take out their aggressions in other ways, I guess.  Unbelievable.  Shouldn't you let the cops do whatever the hell they want as far as smoking?  You don't want to get them angry.  Cops and firefighters should be allowed to do whatever the hell they want. 
[01:06:30]  Right on the job.  Have fun, guys.  They're making crap money doing stuff that none of us would ever even dream of wanting  to do.  Just do it.  Let them smoke.  Yeah.  Bust a drug dealer.  Do the drugs.  Whatever you want.  See what they got going on here in New York with this goddamn trade thing that's going  on?  What?  Oh, the economic summit.  You see the one in Seattle?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, they're busting windows.  They're looting places.  And now, you know, it's been a few months since 9-11, but did the cops really need to deal  with this now? 
[01:07:00]  No.  Like, Rack, I just hope, I hope, because I was watching it on the news and I saw them  that they're all making their signs.  There's about 50 different organizations that just protest for no apparent reason.  This has become like...  Have you seen the haircuts on these guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You see the guy in the paper who has his whole head kind of, you know, crew cut and colored  and then he grew his bangs from here on one side of the face?  You know, if you're in a band, okay.  But if you're not in a band, I'm sorry.  I'm picking you up.  I'm shaving your head completely.  Okay?  Perfect.  It's ridiculous.  And now, the cops are saying, look, we're not going to put up with any violence. 
[01:07:30]  Good.  I think New York has seen a share of violence.  I'll tell you what we should do with these kids, because we have planes leaving every  day going back and forth to Afghanistan.  Yeah.  We get them, shave their heads, put them in Taliban outfits, and we drop them over there  and go, well, see you.  If you make it home, we'll see you then.  But otherwise, goodbye.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  And how smart could they be?  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me hear what Parrothead's opinion is.  Maybe I'm not thinking clearly.  Right.  We're going to send some people down there to talk to the people that are protesting.  Because I don't know what it is.  It's like a World Economic Summit, which is fine and dandy, but then it's turned into 
[01:08:00]  this thing where it just riffraff decides to show up.  I'll tell you what it is.  I'll tell you what it is.  Fish is not on tour right now, and it's all the fish.  It has nothing to do.  Let's make up some signs and protest Starbucks.  Yeah, come on.  Let's go.  Fish.  I never thought of it that way.  Tennis Larry from The Job.  Tonight, 9.30.  ABC.  Why don't you spoil some burger?  How's Lenny doing, man?  Lenny's doing great.  We were on The View this morning.  You guys did The View? 
[01:08:30]  I made Barbara Walters cry, which I was very proud of.  Did you?  Yeah, as opposed to her usually making celebrities cry.  But Lenny was great.  Wait, how'd you make her cry?  Richard Simmons was so afraid of Lenny that he wouldn't come out of his dressing room  until after we left the building.  I swear to God.  Lenny asked one of the crew people, where's Richard Simmons?  He said, well, he doesn't want to come out until you guys are gone.  He thought Lenny was crazy.  Well, he is.  So Lenny knocked on his dressing room door and screaming.  Open the door, you faggot.  It's really funny.  Really funny.  Is Lenny too big for us these days?  No, Lenny had to go back.  He's got a charity thing that he runs up in Boston, a skiing event that he had to go back for. 
[01:09:00]  Now, we would have loved to have him here.  Lenny's got a skiing event.  Yeah, he has a skiing event.  I can't see it.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I know.  For you, I can see the hockey, sure.  Yeah, but no, Lenny on skis.  Lenny on skis.  You don't want that coming up behind you.  Going, get out of the way.  I'm out of control.  What do you think?  I can turn?  I can't turn?  He's lost a lot of weight, though, you know.  The tree was killed today when Lenny Clark hit him.  Speed.  He lost 100 pounds.  Did he?  He's been, yeah.  He looks great.  That was great. 
[01:09:30]  The episode last week with the soup.  Oh, was that last week?  Yeah.  Well, tonight, I got to tell you, tonight is really funny.  I think it's one of the funniest ones.  It was a telescope one where he finds a telescope, Adam.  Yeah.  And, you know, we set it up, and we find this chick across the way doing naked yoga.  And she's blocked by an armoire, so we go over and pretend to be janitors and go in  and move the furniture around.  And then next week is Gina Gershon as a special guest in her underwear.  Oh.  We're at the price of admission right there.  You're going to want to tape that.  You think the board up is shaking now.  The job is a great show. 
[01:10:00]  I'm telling you.  Very cool.  Thanks, guys.  It really is.  Let's go to Andrew.  He wants to smoke USA cigarettes now.  Andrew.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Andrew.  How are you?  Hey, listen.  Hey, I don't smoke, but I'm a patriotic guy, and I want to take up smoking.  I want to know where I can get those USA cigarettes.  I think they're literally like three packs for $4 in your local corner store.  That's where I saw them, anyways.  It was one of those things where you buy one pack, and there's two extra packs, and a  jacket, and some other stuff.  It was like a shirt.  A shirt.  Lighters.  There's all kinds of paraphernalia. 
[01:10:30]  It's like desperate for you to get patriotic smoking.  First, let me say, I don't agree with the protests going on, but basically, it's a lot  of these college kids who want to believe they're making a difference in the world.  They're afraid this world economy thing is going to crush a lot of third world countries.  How do you crush a third world country?  I tell you what.  How?  By being America and just thinning out the herd.  Kids, that's what it's all about.  I'm sorry.  Basic nature.  Basically, at this point, I think we've reached the...  It's like when you're a kid.  You're either with us or against us, and that's it.  Uh-huh. 
[01:11:00]  These kids with the crazy haircuts, if you're not in a band, bye-bye.  You know?  Learn how to play an instrument real quick, because we're coming to pick you up.  Right.  Write a song.  All right, Mike.  Later, boys.  I hate angry college students.  The best thing that happened in the 60s was Kent State.  It's the finest thing.  It's the best thing that happened.  Spoiled brats.  Wow.  First of all, if you're in college, what do you really have to be angry about?  Yeah.  Well, that's why.  They've got to make up things to be pissed at.  It means your parents or somebody is paying about, what, 40 grand a year for you to do 
[01:11:30]  nothing, really.  I'm outraged.  I don't know about you in college.  I got laid and did a lot of drugs.  I wish I could go back.  If it was a 12-year program, I'd go back right now.  It was the best anger.  It was the best time of my life.  Yeah, I got laid like every day.  Where does the anger come from?  There was no anger from me.  I was very happy.  You know, there's not much.  That's why I'm so angry now.  I haven't been in college in 20 years.  I'm really angry.  I think they'd find there's not much time to be angry at, like, Starbucks.  Like you said, if you have to get up at 6 in the morning and work your ass off to keep a roof over your head. 
[01:12:00]  You want to be angry?  Get a mortgage.  You'll see how fast your anger dissipates.  And you won't have time to go out and protest with your friends because you'll lose the house.  And you won't have the 15 hours a week to spend on your haircut.  You know, should I shave the whole thing and leave just the bangs growing on this?  Idiot.  Well, try to get a fat chick out of your hotel room in Philadelphia if you want to know what anger is.  Oh, is that happening to me?  Yeah.  That's bad.  That's a bad experience.  Don't get the hint.  No, they don't.  You killed in Philly and you ended up with a fat chick?  Look, I'm like, look, I got AIDS.  Could you go? 
[01:12:30]  And it still didn't work.  No, she's like, well, I'll drop a few pounds there.  She's waiting for room service, man.  You should have told her the minibar was open.  There's no more nuts.  It's on your way.  How fat was she?  190, 210 in that area.  Wow.  When you use that AIDS line, the worst thing is when they go, that's okay, so do I.  Oh, yeah.  And you're like, ah, Jesus Christ.  What did she look like?  She looked like a water bed.  Kind of shortish, Prince Valiant hair.  Oh, my God.  Nouveau chic haircut. 
[01:13:00]  Fat pig.  I hope you're dead if you're listening.  She didn't enter on Naughty Nighty Contest.  Yeah, she's coming up.  There's some pictures of her coming up.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  What were you drinking?  I was just like.  Everything.  I had a good show, and I'm like, I've got to celebrate.  I've got to get something.  And, dude, the options were gone.  And I'm like, come on.  And she came.  It was awful.  You know, a little short haircut?  Yeah.  They think it makes them look clever with a little bond.  Yeah, they look sassy.  Yeah, a little sassy. 
[01:13:30]  What's that?  A little sass.  That whore.  That's the thanks she gets.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  Brian's pissed off.  He's in Boston.  What's up, Brian?  Dude, I'm really pissed off.  First, I want to say, Dennis Larry, you kick ass.  He's the best.  Opie and Anthony, I used to listen to you when you guys were on the air down here.  Yeah.  And I liked you even more when I found out why you guys got fired.  I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.  Yeah.  You should have lived through that, whatever.  Yeah, it wasn't fun while it was happening, but whatever.  It worked out, though, thank God.  Dude, I'm annoyed.  I'm allergic to shellfish. 
[01:14:00]  I want to go down.  I want to go down to BCN.  I want to win tickets to the Super Bowl.  I can't because if I eat clam chowder, I'm going to die at BCN, and I'm not going to win those tickets.  Yeah, that's our contest we got going for the Super Bowl.  Yeah, that kind of sucks, man.  Yeah.  So what are you saying, Brian, that they should have, like, the clam chowder eating contest for people who can eat clam chowder,  and then a separate thing for you guys?  No, I'm just saying.  Maybe vegetarian vegetables, too.  What are you saying?  I want to win Super Bowl tickets.  Hey, Brian, how about you get someone to represent you? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, then get on.  Yeah, I could do that.  How about the fat chick that you can win?  She can eat a lot of clam chowder.  She did that night.  Explain this to Dennis.  No, we got a bunch of guys coming down to BCN Friday.  We're broadcasting live from there.  And we have a pair of Super Bowl tickets.  So whoever eats the most clam chowder.  Yeah, we just got to do one of those wacky, I even got the wacky horn.  It's a good old-fashioned puking contest.  No, that's good.  And then they eat all the crap, and whoever wins goes to the Super Bowl. 
[01:15:00]  Every ten minutes, they eat another huge bowl of clam chowder,  and then the last person that pukes gets to go to a Super Bowl.  Nice, right?  That's a great contest.  You know, because puking is always fun.  You just see some guy, yeah, I'm good.  You know, because we talked to him beforehand,  and all of them are pumped like they're going to win.  Let me tell you something.  I ate so much chowder one night.  It was unbelievable.  And he's the first guy, bleh.  And it's just fun to watch and listen to.  It's fun to watch people puke.  It is.  It really is. 
[01:15:30]  As long as you're not sitting next to them, you know.  It brings you right back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to love it.  Why don't we take a break?  You're hanging right there.  Oh, we're hanging, yeah.  Any girls going to show up for the Naughty Nighty contest in New York?  Oh, ladies, come on.  Extra boring to get to Dennis Leary.  Yeah.  Stop by with your Naughty Nighty.  Sorry, calm down.  Take a Xanax, pal.  All right.  The job's on tonight with Dennis Leary on ABC 930.  930.  We'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. Line is there for you when life sucks. 
[01:16:00]  Sucks to be made.  Call any time.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rock.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  In the studio, Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar from The Job.  It's on tonight.  930.  ABC.  Yeah.  You know, you want to explain the show really fast?  Yeah.  For maybe people that don't know.  I mean, we've been talking about it off and on for the last year.  Go ahead.  It's a comp.  Okay.  Come on.  Do some work.  How would you explain the job, Adam?  The job is... 
[01:16:30]  You're going to pick up new viewers today.  Barney Miller meets NYPD Blue meets Acid.  All right.  No good.  The job is, without a doubt, one of the funniest, if not the funniest show on TV.  And I don't say that just because I'm on the show.  Although, that's a good reason.  Adam's hilarious on it.  Diane Farr is really hot.  The chick.  Lenny Clark.  Lenny Clark is absolutely hilarious.  And great guest stars.  Next week is Gina Gershon in her underwear.  This week, we're looking at a naked chick doing yoga.  Yeah.  That's great.  I like how you...  You want to laugh your ass and see some really hot chicks. 
[01:17:00]  That's the show to watch.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Watching that ballerina, Vandanova, was nice.  Have you ever seen a hot chick on the West Wing?  Not once.  Not once.  Nope.  I could not imagine watching that goddamn show.  West Wing?  I can't.  I look.  I go, who's...  I haven't watched one.  Who the hell is watching that?  I haven't watched one show.  People that protest the economics, so I'm going to watch it.  Yeah.  I'll tell you what.  Just the Sheen family alone is about 16 million viewers.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  And all the grape workers that he supports.  He's telling everyone in rehab.  It's Mexicans and the Sheens.  That's pretty much it.  But the thing is, Martin Sheen... 
[01:17:30]  And all the guys from rehab, which are...  Yeah, that's right.  Martin Sheen thinks he's the president.  He really does.  Which is odd.  And this is a guy speaking of protests.  Yeah.  Every other week, this guy is...  You know why he's working?  He finally ran out of things to protest about.  Between that...  You know, we did a movie together called Monument Ave back in 97 or 98, and we told him.  I mean, we were serious because we had no budget.  We were producing the thing ourselves, me and Ted Demme, and we said, Martin, when you  come here for the two weeks that we need you, you can't protest anything.  Because he always gets arrested.  He's always trying to get arrested, handcuffed to a tree or something. 
[01:18:00]  You know what I mean?  So...  And we had to actually keep somebody with him, his driver, to make sure he didn't go and  get arrested.  He was in the news all the time during the Reagan administration about the nuclear arms.  That was like his big deal.  He chained himself to this, hi, I'm Martin Sheen, I'm not leaving until you arrest me.  And they get the big bolt cutters, they cut them off, and haul them away.  And then, that problem pretty much solved.  I'm sure there's plenty of nukes out there, but no one seems to care about them anymore.  And then he was protesting, yeah, the grape workers.  The grape workers, he loves the grapes.  Yeah, it's kind of a step down from world destruction to a few wetbacks needing a job. 
[01:18:30]  Guys, I don't know about you, have you ever wondered where the grapes come from?  They're just at the store.  They're there all the time.  They're always there.  I don't care.  And they're not even important, because you can walk right by, pick one and pop it in  your mouth, no one cares.  Nobody, you can steal grapes.  It's not like you walk by a shoe store, you put a shoe on and walk out, someone's going  to be pissed.  Grapes, no one seems to care.  Nobody cares about grapes.  No, people care about the grape growers.  No, I don't care.  I don't even know where they are.  Where are they?  Martin Sheen against people that wear shoes.  You know, shoes squish bugs.  Martin, you're running out of goddamn things to protect them. 
[01:19:00]  I'll get a job.  West Wing, and now he thinks he's the president.  Hey, we talked too long about the West Wing, let's go back to the job.  Yes!  There you go.  My favorite episode of the job is when Adam closed down the Yankee Cranky shop.  I'm still pissed off at you.  Oh yeah, the massage episode.  The massage episode.  Based a little more in fact than fiction, Adam.  Adam did some personal research.  I heard that story.  Whee!  Yeah.  Happy ending.  Happy ending.  When happy ending came around, the woman goes, whee! 
[01:19:30]  She throws her hands up like a birthday party at a Japanese restaurant.  Banzai!  And there I am like Mount Vesuvius.  Run!  Run!  The lava's coming!  Run!  But the thing is, I didn't know, I swear, I was a kid and a friend of mine took me.  I didn't know what was going on when she started.  Yeah, right.  Well, she likes me.  Didn't know what was going on.  I know!  I didn't know what you did.  You thought you came in for a massage and she just liked you?  Yeah!  She likes my penis.  She really likes my penis, this girl.  Look at that! 
[01:20:00]  She loves it.  When I left, my buddy took me and I go, you know what she did for me?  He goes, yeah, I know.  I paid her 40 bucks to do it to you.  I said, oh.  Oh, you're all disappointed.  Oh, yeah.  Not close.  She liked you.  Not close.  Yeah.  No, tell them about the hooker.  You didn't know about her either, right?  She was a bit surprised.  Well, she liked me.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  We're hanging with Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar.  Yeah, I got a question for Dennis.  Yeah.  Because I asked Adam about this last time.  Yeah.  When are you going to have O&A on the radio during a scene in one of the cars?  Oh, yes.  Come on.  I mean, it's a New York-based show. 
[01:20:30]  You guys are in New York.  You've been on for a little more seconds.  Absolutely.  You never know.  You'll never know.  You'll never know.  I appreciate it.  You're in life.  By the way, guys, by far the funniest show on television.  You know, and this is a man with good taste, I can tell.  I think so.  Well, thank you.  Thank you.  Tell your friends to watch.  I always do.  Tell them to stop watching that stupid West Wing.  Do you have any friends named Nielsen?  No.  Sorry.  All right, Chris.  Later, guys.  Bye.  It truly is a great show.  Joe from the NYPD is a detective.  What's up, Joe?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey.  First off, you guys are just talking about the job. 
[01:21:00]  The show is more realistic than any of the other cop shows that have been out there.  Thank you.  So, great show.  Thanks.  Anyway, we're all getting ready to go to this World Summit deal in Manhattan.  Yeah.  And you got, like, maybe 4,000 detectives that never were in uniform, putting a uniform  on, so they're kind of pissed off to begin with.  Yeah.  Oh, just as a presence, huh?  Yeah.  And you guys earned the opportunity to not have to put the uniform on anymore, and now  you got to slap it on because some people decided they want to protest rocks. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  And we really don't care what they're protesting.  We don't care what the world people, the World Summit's about.  Yeah.  But if they do, we've already been told, if they get out of line, we're just to bloody  them and keep going.  Yes.  We'll bloody them and keep going.  By the way, Joe, that's a pretty good policy across the board, don't you think, for people  who want to break the law?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  We're going to bloody you and put you in a truck, okay?  So that's...  Move on.  You want a bologna sandwich?  Get on the truck.  Let's go.  That's right.  Yeah, I think if they think they're going to be able to go like they were in Seattle... 
[01:22:00]  Well, the good thing is they're going to tear it up.  This kid I was talking about, Joe, with the stupid haircut, he's got the long bangs in  the front.  It's easy to grab onto his head, you know?  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  You're wrapping around your middle finger and just pull.  Oh!  Good luck, Joe.  Well, thanks a lot.  Great show again, Dennis.  Thanks, man.  You too, guys.  The show on the radio.  Oh, cool, man.  Thank you.  Let's go to Amy.  Amy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Dennis Leary for president.  That's all I have to say.  He's the greatest.  And your show is totally hilarious, but I'm so sick of hearing all these people going, 
[01:22:30]  oh, the Afghani children, oh, racial profiling, whatever.  You're with us or you're against us.  Simple as that, right?  Hey, racial profiling is back in the biggest possible way and all for the betterment of  America as far as I'm concerned.  That's right.  Yeah.  Go along to Giant Stadium, and Dennis, you rock.  Your show is hilarious.  Thank you.  All right, cool.  Bye.  Bye, Amy.  Dylan wants to shed more light on the protester situation.  Oh, boy.  Dylan.  Hey, what's going on?  The other side.  What's up, Dylan? 
[01:23:00]  How are you doing, Dennis?  How are you?  Well, I'm not really a protester or anything like that, but from what I understand, the  reason that so many people are upset about these meetings is that they're like the biggest  business leaders in the world, and sometimes the decisions they make involve going to other  countries and taking over land of people who have no real documentation of ownership  or anything like that, so they really steal it from them.  Yeah.  And, you know, there are actually a whole bunch of different organizations protesting for  different reasons, but that's one of the things that I know about.  Uh-huh.  I read a list of some of the organizations, and I still don't know what they're protesting. 
[01:23:30]  Believe me.  It's not just about people taking third-world country land.  Who's taking that land?  Yeah.  What land is that?  Well, Afghanistan.  We just took, so there's one.  Well, there you go.  We took it, but we didn't keep it.  I'd like to take, hey, by the way, I'd like to take Iraq, Iran.  I want to take all of them.  Oh, yeah.  Okay?  I hope we keep going.  One of the funny things, though, is that none of us really do know what they're protesting  about.  I mean, right now, it might not seem like a big deal to us, but, you know, I'm sure a  while ago, nobody cared about the state of politics in Afghanistan, and now everybody 
[01:24:00]  cares.  Now they've done something drastic.  Well, you know why they care?  Because they attacked us.  Right.  Nobody cares.  I want to play risk and roll nothing but sixes.  I want to take over everything.  You know, when I was 19 years old, I think the biggest protest we had going on was the  price of weed going up.  Yeah.  That's where your head should be, not up your ass.  That should still be going on.  It's cast me.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Not how much it costs now, but you know what?  That's what you should be worried about.  Dude, I bought two-finger dimes for ten bucks.  Really?  What the hell is this?  It went up. 
[01:24:30]  It went up.  I'm protesting.  It went up because of Martin Sheen, the pot growers.  They're unionized now.  All I care about with the protesters is, at some point, I have to cut over and head  west on 57th.  Yeah.  And if I'm crossing first in Lex, I'm going to be pissed off if the road's closed because  somebody's got to get their head beaten with a police club.  It's going to be a mess tomorrow.  Yeah.  You were going to say something?  Yeah, that sucks.  No.  You're still thinking about the fat chick, right?  I know.  Roll her over the protesters.  It's not going to leave you for a while. 
[01:25:00]  That's a bad scar in your brain.  We have so many...  When you got on top of it, did your ears pump?  I didn't wash you.  I cut my ass on a ceiling fan.  No, I didn't...  I didn't have a bag, so it was just like...  Right now, she's on our friend's radio show going, I had to F some bald comic.  No, she just...  Thank you.  Not a...  We have so many cops checking in.  John, what's up?  Hey, Oney, how you doing, buddy?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  Listen, Dennis.  Yeah.  You by far have got this part down pat. 
[01:25:30]  I'm telling you, man.  You must have did your homework.  We appreciate the support that all you guys are giving us.  Dennis, you guys should do a show like on all these guys working second jobs and our wages,  how low they are.  But I'll tell you right now...  That's next week.  Yeah, we have one of those shows coming out.  Oh, awesome.  Awesome.  Because I'll tell you, man...  That's actually the Gina Gershon episode.  It's about the guys moonlighting, doing security jobs.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Because I'll tell you, man, we work at two, three jobs, trying to make ends meet.  You know, it's rough.  You know, it's rough out there.  But I'll tell you, tomorrow, you know, these guys are coming.  You know, Anthony, we got something special, don't we?  We got Mike Tyson on ice. 
[01:26:00]  We're going to just turn him loose on their asses.  And they're just going to bite him up and tear him up, and he's going to chase him away.  We're not going to have to do nothing.  So, you know, maybe later Mike Tyson will check in and let us know what's going on.  Yeah, sure.  I can't believe they didn't give him his license back, man.  That's unbelievable.  I know.  New York, we want the $300 million.  We want the $300 million.  Bring the money our way.  New York appreciates the business.  Come on, Mike.  Come on to New York.  We love you.  You know, Vegas is insane because they've lost a lot of money from people not traveling 
[01:26:30]  there after September 11th.  They could have cashed in.  They call Mike Tyson their ATM machine whenever they need a big payoff.  An old-fashioned brawl, too, man.  But what is it?  It's the morality of boxing that is being screwed around with Tyson?  I don't get it.  It's two guys.  They beat the crap out of each other in a ring.  Yeah.  And hopefully one guy bleeds, falls down, and doesn't get up.  That's the best ending to a fight, right?  You don't want to see it go to a decision.  No, no, no.  Not necessarily.  Sometimes, you know, you get somebody running with a chair and hitting people over the head.  I mean, those are fine.  They're walkie-talkies. 
[01:27:00]  That's fun, too.  Okay.  Remember the guy's mother who ran into one of me?  Any kind of a crazy brawl.  I mean, I was pissed off.  What if I couldn't see Tyson bite Lennox Lewis' leg at that thing?  I know.  Who's fooling who, though?  This is what we want to see.  Yeah.  As human beings, we want to see the most violent ending to these brawls as we can.  That's why we go.  Yeah, and we know Tyson's going to give us something.  We don't want a 15-round decision based on...  No, we want six rounds of ear biting.  Judges, right.  Pulling on a shiv, stabbing him.  Exactly. 
[01:27:30]  Wouldn't it be great to go, Mike Tyson stabbed him?  Yeah.  It would be all over every front page in the paper.  It's like Tyson came out, third round, he pulled out a shiv, and he just stabbed him.  And he stabbed him.  It was great.  It was like an episode of Oz.  The mom with the shoe.  Oh, yeah.  Do you remember that?  They might have dumped out of that.  That's why I had to see it again.  That's great.  The mom with the shoe going into the ring.  Oh, God.  Man.  I remember that.  Embarrassment on that guy's face when I looked over and saw his mom hitting his opponent 
[01:28:00]  with his shoe.  It's like, ma!  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  That's killer, man.  Get out of the ring!  I don't think that guy ever...  He never fought again.  Would you?  No.  I didn't show my face for a long time.  Just fade into obscurity.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  Hey, I just really wanted to comment about the protest out there.  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  I got out of college a year ago.  I got a degree in criminology.  I've been trying to become a cop ever since.  Yeah.  And the only thing I protested was the fact that Mamiya Bull Jamal, a cop killer, is still 
[01:28:30]  alive.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And the only thing these kids are worried about, the third world countries.  When I was in college, they told me a little something about natural selection.  Yes.  Something about a guy named Darwin.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  If you want to go to the third world countries, go move there and make it better.  Yeah.  You know what?  That's all I want to say.  Dennis Bigfin.  Thanks.  No Tour for Cancer was my first comedy tape ever.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Check out the job tonight, all right?  Check out the job.  All right, you got it.  I got a hockey ticket tonight, but next week.  Where are you going? 
[01:29:00]  Where are you going to see?  Hello?  Hello?  Take it easy, guys.  Wait, Brian, hold on.  You got hockey tickets tonight?  Yeah, well, for the Philadelphia Phantoms, it's the farm club.  I've been trying to get Ranger Island tickets all day long.  Is your kid playing?  That's not the game to watch tonight, my friend.  Hey, you might be able to see a father kill another father.  I'll give it up for you, dude.  I'm not a big Rangers fan.  You can have...  Hockey Dad.  Thank you for getting...  Take the intro.  All right.  We really need it.  Hey, I don't care. 
[01:29:30]  I'm an island of strength.  You got 49 points.  Yeah, I get it.  Thank you.  All right.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye, Brian.  Trying to portray Hockey Dad like the gentle giant.  Yeah.  Did you see that guy's big freaking oven-stuffer roaster fist?  Yeah.  And he slapped the wife around.  See, you heard about that?  Oh, yeah.  That came out in the sentencing, yeah.  Birthday Party?  Yeah.  See, moved around a little bit.  Didn't he really look like if you were doing a comedy sketch about a guilty guy?  This would be the guy...  Yeah.  This big maniac-looking Dick Butkus guy.  Yeah.  With a neck the size of the other guy's...  Probably the other guy's legs.  Oh, the other guy was... 
[01:30:00]  From what I hear, he was a real little son of a bitch, too.  Always brawling.  Yeah, he wasn't.  But, you know, just the idea that this guy tried to pawn it off his self-defense.  Yeah.  And he had his kid testify.  What a scumbag.  I know.  Bastard.  I love this guy.  You got to love this guy.  Oh, my God.  That bitch got mouthy at a birthday party.  Max, look for him.  They can't wait to get him at MCI.  Oh, yeah.  Let me get him in.  Hi.  How are you, Rocky Dad?  You know what he looks like?  He looks like an older version of that kid.  What the hell was his name?  Eddie O'Brien.  Eddie O'Brien.  Remember that?  The gem out of Massachusetts. 
[01:30:30]  Somerset, right?  That killed his friend's mother.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He looked like him grown up.  They could have a little father and son bagel nosh there up there in the prison.  And we got to go to Andy in Cleveland.  Yes, Andy.  Andy, what's up?  You guys, New York's going to have some problems, because I got another girl in here, and we  got three more on the way.  Oh, really?  Cleveland is tearing this up, man.  I got 21-year-old Kristen in here.  She's wearing a sheer white knighted see-through top, and she even brought a little schoolgirl  knighted to wear it to change into after this one.  Is she hot, Andy?  I'd have to say pretty darn cute, yeah. 
[01:31:00]  Why don't you guys have, like, a live video hookup?  Well, we're getting the pictures.  Have you seen the pictures, Dennis?  Damn, we got, like, 40 girls in the contest, right?  I haven't seen the pictures.  Show them the one from Washington.  That's one of my faves.  You must be talking about number 37, Stephanie?  Yeah, Stephanie, number 37.  Hey, Andy, we look forward to seeing the pics, all right?  Right on, man.  Andy, put her in that little schoolgirl outfit.  Yeah.  It's coming, dude.  It's coming.  All right, cool.  Later.  I'm picking the winner right now.  It's Stephanie.  Which one's not?  I'm picking the winner, because she went the distance.  No, show Dennis the next picture.  That's Stephanie. 
[01:31:30]  That's Stephanie.  Scroll down.  Look at this.  Holy.  Look at that.  Did you?  Wow.  Look at that.  Scroll down another one.  We just got a nice purse from Dennis.  How old is she?  We don't know.  We don't know much about her.  I hope she calls us.  Let's cut her open and count the rings.  Hello, Stephanie.  It's the Naughty Nighty contest.  She's still holding it, so officially she's still in the contest.  So in the night.  Stephanie, how would you like a part of the job?  Yeah.  Wow.  She's pretty good.  Not bad, right?  That's nice.  That's going the distance.  We have all different types, man. 
[01:32:00]  This contest is good.  How many you got total?  40.  Here, clean Dennis's 42.  Can we jump through a few of these things?  Yeah, clean Dennis's palate and show him the other side of the spectrum.  No, don't give him the cleansing of the palate.  I'll show him.  I'll show you.  Go to this one.  Oh.  That's not sorbet.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, my God.  Is that the girl you were with?  That's not.  Oh, my God. 
[01:32:30]  What's her name?  You know what?  That one's not bad.  What's the other one?  I thought she choked on a ham sandwich in London.  Yeah, she did, actually.  Naughty night.  That's Alaska where the nights are six months long.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Wow.  Where's she from?  The other one you guys are giving a hard wrap.  She's from the Serengeti.  All right.  Now show them another good one.  Go to Bobby.  Good, right?  She had a great clam bowl.  She looks like the chick from the Spice Girls.  Oh, yeah.  A little bit.  Hush.  Hush.  Hush. 
[01:33:00]  Hush.  Hush.  Dirty Spice.  All right.  Now, anal spice.  Anal spice.  Now, ang clean the palate again for Dennis.  All right.  I guess to cleanse the palate, you'd need...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  No.  No.  Ow.  Ow.  Go to the other picture.  Go to the...  Oh, my God.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  What are you trying to do to me?  She's got a bell around her neck.  Oh, my God.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Go to the one where it looks like she should have a Rams jersey covering up her shoulders.  I would work that. 
[01:33:30]  I would work that.  That's not that bad.  I'm telling you.  It's not that bad.  There's no surprise.  There's no surprise out of you, Nora.  She's going to be protecting Brady this Sunday.  Where is she from?  That's great.  The Amazon.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Oh, we don't get out the names or the numbers yet.  I think it's so offended.  Because we need more girls to show up.  We don't want to scare them off.  That's Little Morgan.  Her name is Trigger.  Little Morgan.  I know she gave out the names of the hot dog.  Where's Morgan from?  She's from Philly.  Another Philly girl.  Morgan. 
[01:34:00]  How old is Morgan?  Morgan is 12 years old, Dennis.  And you know what?  I don't care.  I used to be a teacher.  I can help.  Should we clean the palate one more time, man?  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah, one more time.  Where's the one I was thinking of?  I don't know her name offhand.  I think she pulled out.  She pulled out of the concert?  Oh, the man?  Oh, right there.  But she's still...  Go to...  No.  Yeah.  No?  I think Opie spends a lot of time with us at home.  She's got it burned on a disc.  I know.  We won't give a number, but go to the small caliber weapon. 
[01:34:30]  Where is it?  She's not that bad.  No.  Yeah, she's not that bad.  No, the other one had a dorsal fin.  This one's...  This one's all right.  That one's all right?  Yeah.  I mean, comparatively to the other two.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not, you know...  Yeah, look at what you're doing.  There are the other two.  Who's that?  Who's that?  Ooh.  That's Amy.  Amy's pretty hot.  Where's Amy from?  She did a reshoot yesterday.  Amy from...  Dumper.  We took about 40 pictures of Amy.  Amy's right here in New York.  That's the thing.  That's it.  That's the couch.  The special couch.  She had like...  Hello, Amy.  Hello, Amy.  Danny's nice.  Dr. Vary will see you now. 
[01:35:00]  Look at this just gawking over pictures here.  Are we on the air?  I mean, we're off.  We're just...  At least they can play along at home.  We've got to get some live girls in here.  Oh, they can access...  This is your website, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what are we talking about?  After we get about 832,000 girls posted on here, we're going to vote and let the listeners  take the best one.  We're going to take our time.  We're just going to have a circle jerk and just quit the radio.  Whatever girl eats the cracker wins.  Hey, my penis came off. 
[01:35:30]  Aim for the one you like.  That's it.  There's your contest.  That's it.  Bullseye.  Game wins.  Anything off the top shelf.  Do they just show up all day, like every day?  Yeah, but in New York, we're having a problem.  Like day one, we had a lot of girls come in.  Philly, Cleveland, they're going crazy.  Boston, they can go F themselves.  They haven't sent one girl to the studio up there.  No, I don't get it either.  So what?  They're all studying.  They're all college chicks. 
[01:36:00]  I was a hooker back in the day.  I was supposed to be their team, man.  Wait, where's Rick?  Should we, we should play Angelico, one of those.  He was singing songs for us.  He's like 92, 93.  He's out of his mind.  He's senile.  I think.  Sometimes he's got his moments of clarity, but others he's.  But wasn't he one of those guys, I kind of want to sell you the guy's reputation.  Was he one of those guys that back, way back in the day was getting high with Mitchum and all those guys?  Oh, really?  I think he was one of those stories.  Mitchum just, what a hero that guy is.  Unbelievable.  Boozing, doing drugs. 
[01:36:30]  Smoking weed all day.  Didn't care.  Didn't care.  All right, here's Buddy Epson.  Buddy Epson got high with Socrates.  Here's Buddy singing Angelica.  Aw.  It's short.  Who put the jam on the pussycat's tail?  Oh, yeah.  Who put the grease on the banister rail?  Who put cement in the scrubbing up pail?  Who, Angelica.  Oh.  Screeching tires.  Out on the drive.  Uncle Jed.  Who squeezed the goldfish until they aren't alive? 
[01:37:00]  Who spilled her mommy's Chanel number five?  Listen to this note right here.  Who, Angelica.  You ever just think maybe the Grim Reaper loses some files sometimes and just slips through the cracks?  You know, like any job, you go, oh, damn, I was supposed to do that last week.  And you forget, and you think the Grim Reaper goes, Buddy, Buddy Epson, I knew I saw that name in my book.  I forgot.  Yeah, Buddy.  I got to, you got to promise me if I ever get, if I ever hear you on the radio going, Connecticut School of Broadcasting. 
[01:37:30]  Who put the pussycat's tail?  I'm coming to get you.  Who put the pussycat's tail?  You scared me there, man.  I know, you scared me for a second.  All right, Buddy.  That's going to be good.  Buddy rocks.  Yeah.  Who put the pussycat's tail?  I can't find it.  Who put my pussy in her mouth?  Angelica.  Angelica.  Who filed charges against her Uncle Buddy and Jerry? 
[01:38:00]  Who did I touch where the bathing suit covers?  Jethro.  Jethro.  Jethro.  Uncle Jed, you can't talk no more.  What's that guy's name?  What's his name?  Max Baer.  Max Baer.  Where's he now?  I don't know.  I heard he was in Vegas.  Vegas.  What's he doing?  Yeah, he's doing like producing.  Three to five.  Directing.  Three to five.  Producing porno.  Should we play Buddy Epson forgetting how to sing the theme song?  Yeah, this is kind of... 
[01:38:30]  This is really uncomfortable.  Yeah, this is bad.  You like uncomfortable things?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You like the cringe thing?  Oh, yeah.  All right, check this out.  We asked him to sing the theme song.  Yeah.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jed, a poor montaneer, barely kept his family  fan, and that's it, wasn't it?  And then one day, oh, he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people, I'm sorry.  Oh, Angelica. 
[01:39:00]  Angelica.  Come and listen to the story.  It started out real fast.  Yeah.  And then the second line is like, oh.  I'm a famous Mr. Red.  No, that's not it.  My synapse.  I'm breaking it up.  You're on Gilligan's aisle.  No, that's not it.  Is it modern day America?  Gladys, what's up?  Hi.  You guys got to play Buddy Epson with the girl moaning and groaning.  Oh, okay.  See, we'll make fun of you after you leave, Dennis. 
[01:39:30]  I guess so.  I can't wait to hear this.  You get it?  Let's see what's going on here.  All right, we'll do that as we take a break, Gladys.  All right, bye, guys.  Bye, Gladys.  Here's Buddy doing his well doggy, well doggy.  He was kind of doing it like a song.  Yeah.  And we decided it would sound good with some porno music and a girl moaning.  And it kind of works.  Yeah, check this out.  It's the reason.  You did or lose it.  I, uh, I don't know how it's going to show.  I, uh, well doggy, well doggy, well doggy, well doggy, well doggy. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, doggy, yeah doggy, yeah doggy, yeah doggy.  Oh, doggy, oh doggy.  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh.  I, uh, I, uh, I, uh, is that supposed to be sexy?  I, uh, I'm sorry.  Hey, well doggy to you.  You guys are really twisted.  Come on, man.  Way nice. 
[01:40:30]  Well doggy, well doggy.  Oh, man, very nice.  Yeah, that's fun.  Are you guys hanging or what?  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  Dennis Leary, Adam Ferrara from The Job.  It's on tonight on ABC 930.  Watch the damn show.  930, watch the show, laugh your ass off,  follow your chair, puke.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  What do you do here?  Look, look, look at breasts.  If I wasn't on this show,  I'd be out there with a wow sticker just crawling for breasts.  Hey, here's a pirate.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:41:00]  And E.W.  Uh, we're back with The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Dennis Leary, Adam Ferrara in the studio from The Job.  It's on tonight at 930 on ABC.  Yeah.  But who cares about them?  I might be able to get Islander tickets for tonight.  You are a whore, man.  J.D., what's up?  Hey, who's this?  O.P.?  Yeah.  What's happening, man?  Tell me you got tickets for the Islander Ranger game tonight.  I got four in the skybox and I got four in the blue line.  I don't understand the hold button, though.  Who's that jackass that answers the phone?  I apologize for that. 
[01:41:30]  I'll have him fired immediately.  Oh, shut up.  You are disgusting.  He's dead.  No, I mean, really.  I'm the one holding the tickets and I got to be put on hold.  All right, hang on a second.  There's a bunch of cops here.  Hey, guys.  Arrest that guy.  The hold button guy.  You know, J.D., I fully agree with you and Stinky is fired starting tomorrow.  Stinky's a filthy, dirty whore.  Now, what do you need for the tickets?  You want an autograph from Dennis Leary and our pal Adam Farrar?  Actually, I'm a big fan of Dennis Leary, but I'm not an autograph guy.  I'm not a star heifer, as they talk about. 
[01:42:00]  What do you think he is, a fat chick in Philly?  Man, Dennis is killing with lines that are getting dumped out of him, unfortunately.  But that's funny.  Well, are you in the area?  My buddy owns a bar at Tupelo's across the street.  I mean, I don't know your guys' schedule or how many guys want to go.  They're just mentioning the bar is pretty valuable.  How's that?  The what?  It's a free ad for the bar.  There you go.  Tell us about the bar.  Give us a sticker.  We'll put it on the show. 
[01:42:30]  Tell us about it.  Right across the street.  It puts two shorts to shame, if you remember the old days.  Yes.  Yes.  But, I mean, I'll probably be over there, like, probably in an hour, if you guys...  So I've got to find you for the tickets?  There's going to be eight Opie's walking up to them with...  Hello!  My name is Opie.  I need a ticket.  I've come to see Island Man play Ranger Boy.  It is the processing that makes my voice sound different. 
[01:43:00]  Give me tickets.  There's an Opie in every town, bro.  I'm screwed.  Do you want to sit on the blue line or do you want to sit upstairs?  Do you want chicken fingers or do you want to see hockey?  Oh, blue.  Blue line, always.  Don't like those guy boxes.  I need to be down low.  Where are you right now?  Those are...  I'm actually heading into the city.  I'm on the hutch.  All right.  Well, can't you figure out a meeting place?  Yeah.  How about the station?  Yeah, come to the station.  Why don't you come to the station?  What the hell for?  You won't get a...  What the hell for?  I'm not even...  I'm not into meeting you goofballs. 
[01:43:30]  I'll give you the ticket.  Well, just leave them with the security guy downstairs.  I'll tell you what, Gary.  You tell me what to do and I'll do it.  Well, how many do you need?  Two.  Two on the blue line.  Those are waiters.  You're not taking...  You're not taking little Gary?  You get an opportunity to get a free ticket now.  You can take little Gary.  Gary's in the Bronx or something.  Oh.  Gary.  Who's little Gary?  You're right.  Little Gary.  He couldn't get you.  He was 11.  He just turned 12.  A kid... 
[01:44:00]  Oh, I know.  Idolizes Opie.  Opie has promised to take him to a hockey game and has since just blown him off.  Yeah, but not Rangers.  Well, who's that sick game?  Who's that sick game?  Thank you.  Exactly.  I'm waiting for a weekend game with a sub-500 game.  Yeah, exactly.  You know what?  There's no swearing and cursing and no fights.  It's not like it's a 19-year-old sorority girl, eh?  Yeah.  There's a crossroads for this kid right now, and you're sending him off on the bad side.  Here's Gary right now.  He's 12 years old.  Gary.  Gary.  Gary.  Gary?  Oh, my God.  Where is he?  Let me try this again. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, little young Gary.  Don't lose the guy with the tickets.  Gary?  Here's something, but...  I blew off the guy...  Hold on.  JD.  I love Zopie.  JD, you're still there, right?  Yeah, I'm here.  All right.  One more try.  Hey, Gary.  Everyone's calling in as Gary.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me try this, Gary.  There's a midget calling in now.  Gary.  Yeah.  Here he is.  Here he is.  Gary.  You got a ticket?  Aw, Zopie.  Come on, man.  Gary. 
[01:45:00]  You're a bastard.  Gary, it's Ireland of Rangers.  I know.  But it's a free ticket.  You're more like Tampa Bay.  No.  Yes, you are.  What, are you insane?  I'll shoot myself as I was in Tampa Bay.  I hate Tampa Bay.  Opie, this is the perfect opportunity.  It's not even your ticket.  He sees Tampa Bay.  Show him the pictures of the girls.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Gary, you want to go to the game tonight?  Yeah.  All right.  You got to go find this guy and pick up the tickets.  You're digging such a hole for him right now. 
[01:45:30]  It's funny.  I'm trying to be funny.  It sucks.  Gary, get on your bike.  Ride up to the hut.  She's going to meet you at a parking lot.  I just want to say I love you.  And Ferrari, you are the funniest.  And you know Dennis Larry?  I'm nice to you.  Dennis Larry, I love you.  He's the hystericalest comedian that's around.  Dennis, seriously, this guy's going on like 30.  He's 12 years old.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's got a girlfriend, right?  You still got that girl?  Yeah, don't say anything.  You got a girlfriend?  Don't say anything.  Why?  What, your parents listening?  He was telling me a little something. 
[01:46:00]  How old's your girlfriend?  On a commercial break.  Yeah.  How old's your girlfriend?  She's like 13.  She's 13?  She's 13.  Older woman.  He's 12.  Oh, but he's got another girl on his side.  Don't say anything.  I just want to say I'm done with her.  Oh, you're done with her.  You're done with her, huh?  Yeah.  What happened there?  I don't want to get into it.  It only gets worse, kid.  Thank God I didn't marry her.  Gary, you...  It took everything from me.  I learned that from Michael Jordan and everybody else.  They got married.  You'll protect those women in the car. 
[01:46:30]  Michael Jordan lost his mansion.  He lost his mansion there.  It's the bitches that'll get you, right, Gary?  Yeah, it's the bitches that'll get you.  They might...  They might...  I'll turn this into baseball.  They might have a 1.8 average, but in the end, they'll have a 90-point average.  Hey, Gary, speaking of that, how's school going, by the way?  Good.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you're doing well?  Hey, Gary, you've got to trust me on this one, okay?  You have to tell everyone...  I told...  You'll be a hero on this show.  Tell everyone why you're not going out with your girlfriend anymore. 
[01:47:00]  No.  Why?  Come on.  No, because my dad's listening to me.  Oh, your dad's going to think you're the coolest kid ever.  Trust me.  No, he doesn't like that.  Your dad's very proud right now.  You can make your dad very jealous if you tell that story.  All right, let's just say she was cheating on me.  She was cheating on you with who?  One of my friends.  And how old is your friend she was cheating with?  Same age as me.  Same age as you.  That's unacceptable, Gary.  You're right.  I don't.  That's why I don't, though.  Hey, you know what?  I learned from people's mistakes. 
[01:47:30]  Gary's going to be president of the United States one day.  You can tell, tomorrow.  Take him to the hockey game, you creeper.  Yeah, I know.  What a bastard, man.  And I told you, Opie, my two favorite hockey teams, Rangers and Islanders.  Hey, Gary.  What?  If you tell the real reason why.  No, I don't trust you.  An above 500 team.  I don't trust you.  I don't trust you.  Yeah, there you go.  Gary, you've got to want it.  He does learn.  I'm thinking Islanders Flyers, if you tell the story.  No, no.  Why not?  No.  He wants Islander Rangers.  You can just know what you do, Gary.  This is what I do, and it gets me out of trouble all the time. 
[01:48:00]  What?  Just say, ah, that was for the radio.  No.  No.  I was just telling the story for the radio.  Gary, if Dennis Leary promises that old people take him to the game.  Yeah.  Gary.  You've got Dennis Leary backing you up.  You've got Dennis Leary's ear right now.  Gary.  No, no.  No.  No, no.  Stop.  Gary.  Stop.  Gary.  I'm going to hang up the phone.  Gary.  We're going to call you back.  We're going to come to your house.  Try it.  Try it.  We'll come to your house.  Gary, you've got to trust me on this one.  Gary, I'll smooth things over with your dad and everything.  Without saying how.  You don't have to get smoothed over for anything. 
[01:48:30]  How did you find out she was cheating on you?  My friend told me.  The friend that was cheating?  Yes.  Wow, that's a good friend.  Jeez.  What did he say?  He was like, oh, your friend's cheating on you, so I was like, thanks.  He walked up to her and said goodbye.  He's like, why, why?  I was like, because you're cheating on me.  What constitutes cheating in a relationship between a 12 and 13-year-old?  Kissing.  Yeah.  Hanging out.  Yeah, that's it?  No.  I have to start doing.  No.  I got Tampa Bay Lightning tickets. 
[01:49:00]  And you're pointed?  All right.  Come on, then.  We're pointing at him, right?  All right, let's just take...  By the way to hell?  I'll tell you what, Gary.  If we guess it, will you confirm?  Did your friend...  I'll say maybe.  All right.  No, no, how about baseball?  Like, we were talking baseball.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  Did your friend do...  No.  And your friend and your girlfriend do things that Jim Norton and a fat girl did in Philadelphia?  I doubt. 
[01:49:30]  Uh-huh.  You doubt?  I'm not sure.  Maybe.  Maybe.  That's a little vague, too.  Because he didn't plunge a knife into his chest.  I want to say it over the air.  All right.  If you tell a story, you're going to impress a lot of...  Gary, do you have an attorney sitting next to you?  No, that's why I'm not saying it.  All right.  All right.  I swear, if you even say it when I get off the air...  What are you going to do, beat him up?  No.  I call you out. 
[01:50:00]  Gary, listen.  Gary, I would have said it already, you know?  Yeah, I don't trust you, man.  But he'll take you to the game.  You don't trust anybody, apparently.  I want you to say it.  Huh, me?  Yeah.  He's thinking about it.  Ooh, you can hear him thinking.  Blue line.  Ooh.  I want the flyers.  Flyers.  Guaranteed by Dennis Leary.  Behind the goal.  Jeremy Roenick.  Every time they score a goal...  Shut up, shut up.  Shut up.  ...tussle in your hair.  Rick Tockett.  Shut up. 
[01:50:30]  What do you think?  Hot dogs, beer.  Yeah.  I hope you'll get your hooker.  Hookers.  Heidi Fleiss.  I wish.  I don't want to get the bug, nudge, nudge, wink, wink.  He listens to our show too closely.  He doesn't want to get the bug.  Wow.  It's called the ninja.  Then it's actually the bug.  The high five.  Well, all we know is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she was cheating with  another kid.  You know how we can guarantee this to the kid?  We got 12 New York City police departments. 
[01:51:00]  All kinds of cops here that can say, hey, look, he'll take you to the game.  What do you say, Gary?  No.  He's not looking at me.  He's not.  He's not looking at me.  So you know what?  This kid's the kid you want in your team.  Yeah.  That's it.  You're trying to keep secrets.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  All right.  Your Honor, I didn't see anything.  I didn't see nothing.  Yeah.  I didn't see anything.  You got nothing on me, Papa.  You got nothing on me.  Gary, what else do you want to say?  We've got to move on here.  I just want to say Dennis Leary and Ferrari, you guys are the best. 
[01:51:30]  All right, Gary.  All right.  All right.  Well, you're going to watch the job tonight?  Hell, yeah.  Have you watched it yet?  I've only watched the first season.  Haven't saw...  Where Adam pulls down the Yankee Cranky shop, right?  Oh, nice.  Keep your pimp hands strong, little brother.  All right, Gary.  All right, Gary.  All right.  See you.  Bye.  There you go.  I ain't ready.  He's a good kid.  12-year-old Gary.  That's good.  Time.  I don't punk out.  He's a stand-up guy.  Yeah, he would not give up.  He's three feet standing up.  What are you doing?  12 years old, going on 30.  Just turned 12. 
[01:52:00]  And, dude, if I'd have known that was his girlfriend, I never would have done that.  Oh, God.  You're a despicable man.  Despicable.  Hey, Jason, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Yo, Adam, big fan of Dennis.  I got both the CDs, but I got a question.  How did you make Barbara Walters cry?  I got to know.  She tried to turn on me on the show and say, you know, I read a magazine article that said  you would never do my show because all I do is make celebrities cry.  And I said, yeah, that's what you do.  You make everybody cry, so the ratings go up. 
[01:52:30]  Julia Roberts, whoever it might be.  So she said, no, I don't make everybody cry.  And then she grabbed my hand and she said, well, you know, I think she thought she was  going to get me to cry.  And she said, and it would be funny.  And she said, you know, has anybody close to you ever died?  And I was like, yeah, my cousin died in the fire two years ago.  Ted Demme died two weeks ago.  And she went, oh, my God.  And I was like, see, now you're crying because she actually started to well up.  And then we just kind of burned it on her.  Jesus.  No, it was the guy he did.  Quick, play bloody Epson again.  All right.  I don't want to get the bug. 
[01:53:00]  The high five.  The bug.  I don't want to get the ninja.  That kid's unbelievable.  Isn't that something?  I know.  Like it's like some kind of a dopey Hollywood kid.  Where does he live?  He's Jersey, right?  No, I think he's now in the Bronx.  Is he?  Oh, he's one of those kids.  He moves around a lot.  Has he ever come into the show to visit?  We don't know what he looks like.  Oh, really?  No.  He looks like Finster.  His name is Ant Hill Harry.  At least baby face Finster.  Them's not babies.  Them's fidgets.  You guys ever get midgets in here?  We've had a midget girl for a, she had a porno website, and we kind of got her almost naked. 
[01:53:30]  We got her to take everything off but her thong.  Yeah.  Her thong?  A midget thong?  When you see a midget standing, she was standing right on the console there, and her head didn't  hit the thong.  Oh, my God.  We had Tom Hanks.  We had Tom Hanks.  Bony elbows.  Oh, my God.  Bull legs.  We had Tom Hanks' son in here.  Yeah.  Colin Hanks.  Colin Hanks was in here.  Was it with the midget?  Yeah.  Yeah.  At the same time, the midget and Jack Black.  And Jack Black. 
[01:54:00]  And they were just like, oh, because I'm really pushing it.  I just, I threw everything out the window and just said, I don't care.  If I got to sound like I'm begging to see a naked midget, I'm begging to see a naked  midget.  You see the naked midget.  You saw Total Recall, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Remember the naked midget now?  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of wanted to see a naked.  Hey, why not?  Right.  So when this midget walked in.  If you see a midget in the room, why not see a naked midget?  I want to see her little turkey leg, boned leg.  That little wishbone physique.  It's like a foot long.  Yeah, little bones just popping out everywhere. 
[01:54:30]  So what did she get?  She got embarrassed?  She wouldn't go all the way?  She wouldn't go all the way.  She wouldn't.  I wanted to, to tell you the truth, I wanted to see midget Bush.  Did you really?  I wanted to see the midget Bush.  The midget thing.  I want to see if it's smaller, bigger, proportion.  Well, you know, that can be arranged.  Really?  Yeah.  You can get that.  You know, she's got the porno website.  Yeah.  And we got nothing for Dennis today.  There's nothing.  I want to get the NYPD for you.  I'd like some naked Chinese midgets next time I come to the show.  Wouldn't that be great?  Hey, if I bring Lenny, Lenny loves naked Chinese midgets.  Does he?  Yeah.  It doesn't surprise me.  When you come back, we guarantee that. 
[01:55:00]  Okay, because you know, he said if he gets some money off the show, if the show becomes  a hit, first thing he's going to buy is a Chinese midget just to walk around with  him.  Next time, I swear, I promise, unlike Opie's promise to a 12-year-old boy, I promise we  will get a Chinese naked midget for Lenny.  Someone remember that for us.  Because we won't forget.  Do you remember we were shooting the Hasidic midget?  Oh, yeah.  We saw a Hasidic midget.  Yeah.  With the curls that went right down to the floor.  Oh, yeah.  He was tripping over the curls.  He was running.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:55:30]  Because his buddies were leaving him.  He was running after him.  Unbelievable.  That's classic.  I like midgets, man.  Midgets are just funny.  Yeah.  You don't see as many as you used to.  You used to see a lot of midgets.  You don't see that many anymore.  No, they kind of weeded him out with genetics, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a shame.  There's not as many as there used to be.  There used to be always a few in school.  Well, now you can find out what you're having, you know?  Yeah.  That's all the fun out of it.  Well, you see a lot less of them ever since Roe v. Wade.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Jasmine.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, Jasmine. 
[01:56:00]  Hi.  Don't be ruining any family pictures.  You know the difference?  I took the back road to that joke and you went right down the highway.  He's ruining any family.  That's awful, man.  We had the same idea.  I took the back road.  You're an awful, awful man.  Jasmine, go ahead.  Yes.  Hi, Jasmine.  Hi, how are you?  Is that your real name?  Yes, it is.  Really?  Yeah.  It's usually a stripper name.  Yeah, where do you dance?  So, what do you have today, Jasmine, for us?  What happened? 
[01:56:30]  What do you have for us today?  I would like to be a naughty 90.  Get down here!  Now!  Get in the car!  Hey, what are you doing?  Where are you?  Yeah.  What are you waiting for?  Where are you?  Well, I've been busy a few days and I just wanted to call and tell you that I wanted to  come down.  Where are you right now?  Right now, I'm at home naked.  Where's home?  Where's home?  Brooklyn, New York.  Why don't you put some clothes on, come here, and then take them off again?  Yeah, why are you naked?  I mean, that's a good thing, but why?  I just came out of the shower, that's why.  Jasmine, you like hockey?  I hope he's got tickets. 
[01:57:00]  She's clean.  How long would it take you to get here, miss?  Oh, my God.  I have to take the W train to Manhattan.  Get on it.  All right, that doesn't help.  I live in Jersey.  How long does that translate into?  Um, probably a half an hour.  We can do that.  Yeah.  Get in the car.  Just show up.  Candy?  Yeah, we got some cafe lattes.  Your fine African princess.  All right, Jasmine, there's nothing going on here.  We're going to move on, all right?  Hopefully we'll see you tomorrow, okay?  Okay, all right.  We've got to cut our losses.  We're disappointed by girls and 12-year-olds. 
[01:57:30]  Stephanie.  Isn't that awful?  Hey, Stephanie.  Yeah?  From D.C., what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Are you the Stephanie from D.C.?  Yes, I am.  Hello, Stephanie.  All right, let's get our pictures back up.  One Stephanie.  From the Naughty 90 contest.  Oh, yes, from the Naughty 90 contest.  Are you the one that got pretty much, oh, my God, June.  Yeah, it's Stephanie.  Turn it off so Dennis can talk to you.  Oh, my God, this is you.  Get on a plane.  A guaranteed finalist in the Naughty 90 contest.  Stephanie from Washington, D.C.  So when did you decide to lose the 90 when they were taking the pictures there? 
[01:58:00]  Towards the end, I figured it'd be different.  Nobody else has.  No, no.  You raised the bar in this contest.  More than a bar.  Stephanie, how old are you?  24.  I'll be 24 next month.  What do you do for a living?  I'm a surgical assistant.  Stop it.  Really?  Yeah.  I have a bad kidney.  Not that kind.  I work for an oral surgeon.  I've got a cavity.  I've got a cavity.  Too many jokes there. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, I know, I know.  Make up your own jokes.  Very nice.  Hey, Stephanie, I've got to ask, and I think I know the answer.  Are those real?  No.  Hey, they're hers.  I admire the artist's work.  Wait a minute.  They're not real?  That's a good job.  No, never mind.  That's a great job.  That's a really good job.  Why does an oral surgeon need a fake boobs?  Or an assistant?  For an assistant?  Well, fun.  For me, anyway.  What size were they before?  It was a B-cup.  A little B-cup.  Yeah, a little B.  A little B-cup. 
[01:59:00]  The size of a spit sink.  That's very nice.  Thank you.  You're doing a great job there, Poe.  Well done.  Take a couple of bucks out of petty cash.  Yeah, you're getting rave reviews on your pictures up here in New York.  Oh, thanks.  If you want to go down and get more pictures taken, then, you know, we're not going to  see you.  Oh, I can?  Okay.  I was going to go ahead and have an outfit, because I knew the other girl, Amy, she went  down and did a reshoot.  Oh, you can do a reshoot.  I love the competition.  And I'm like, well, I don't know if I can, so if I can, then I probably will.  Of course.  You absolutely can do a reshoot. 
[01:59:30]  Cool.  Then I will.  All right, Stephanie.  I'll probably go down tomorrow, then.  We look forward to your latest pictures tomorrow, right?  Okay.  All right.  Hope you like them.  All right.  All right.  I got it.  Let me think.  No.  No.  No.  That's one of the...  It's a hard show.  It's a TV show.  Isn't that crazy?  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Boobs and all.  Tans.  Tans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That disappointed me immensely when I found out they were fake.  Yeah.  But they're fake.  You know something?  I like real.  I agree with you 100%.  I like real ones.  I like the real ones. 
[02:00:00]  Medium sized, big.  I like them real.  As long as they're real.  You know what the fake ones...  To me, that should affect Stephanie's final score in the contest.  You think so?  Wow.  It probably will, because any time we've had a contest like this, the fake boobs do not win  out.  See?  You lose a point for execution.  Yeah.  I like the real ones, too.  Very good.  The fake ones, they kind of look good.  They look better clothed.  Yeah.  Once you take the clothes off, you kind of see.  You can see, and also they feel like, you know...  Yeah.  Like a planet.  A rubber tire. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, like a planet.  You know?  Like a Golden Globe Award.  Like one of those things you see through and have to go in.  And you can see them in shades.  Hey, that'd be fun.  That'd be fun.  That'd I go for.  See, that's it.  That's it.  That's what I want.  Van Halen on the way.  A shiny smidget with fancy milk lobe cans.  They are dumping out like crazy.  Jump up and down, make it snow, little girl.  All right.  You know who was on the...  Daddy wants to go to Winterland, honey. 
[02:01:00]  You know who was on the hotline?  Slam up on the counter.  Who?  Steve-O was checking in and he hung up.  Uh-oh.  Do you watch that show Jackass on MTV?  I've seen it a couple of times.  Oh, my God.  We had one of the guys in here two days ago.  Are they back on the air?  No.  This guy, Steve-O, he's got this DVD out, which is just...  It's worse than anything you ever saw him do on Jackass.  All the stuff they will not show on MTV.  Stuff they wouldn't show on MTV.  Fire, things like that, that the kids might say, oh, this is fun.  Let me stick a bottle rocket up my patoot and light it. 
[02:01:30]  And he does these things.  Fat chicks in Philly.  He set off a mortar.  My patoot.  Yeah, whatever.  A-hole.  He set off a mortar in the backseat of his car as he was driving.  One of those big poof, lots of mortars.  Just for the hell of it.  He strapped all...  You ever see how you go to Chinatown on 4th of July?  Yeah, yeah.  Huge strings that are a few yards long of firecrackers.  Wound them around himself.  Many of them. 
[02:02:00]  There had to be thousands.  And lit them all.  And it just sounded like...  And he's running around being blown up by firecracks.  You couldn't even see him.  The fire coming out of the fireworks was too bright for the camera.  The guy's out of his mind.  He sounds like he smokes a little weed.  Oh, more than that.  He almost OD'd on our show.  He came in here.  No joke.  He's got a girlfriend named Dee who, when she's on the West Coast,  F's Henry Rollins, which is dangerous enough.  That's bad.  Because on the East Coast, now she's having sex with Steve-O. 
[02:02:30]  She did eight Xanax.  They're drinking tequila.  She could barely talk.  Do we have that quip, the mule clip?  Yeah, listen to this.  You've got to get the mule clip.  She's a governor still, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, Norton brought up the fact that you can drink out of his mule.  The mule being the unit.  And she actually thought he had a mule.  A real mule.  Just by the way she says it, you can tell how intoxicated she is.  Yeah, listen.  Could she catch my mule if I throw it?  I have a mule.  I mean, I have a goat. 
[02:03:00]  The bias is I'll literally be ready to play.  Well, I really do have a goat.  Do you?  Well, he really has a mule.  Yeah.  She was slant.  He's going to have a goat.  He's calling back.  Oh, here he is.  Here he is.  Steve-O, how F'd up were you when you were here?  I did.  Now, we're not using this F word anymore, are we, dude?  Yeah, well, we're still on the...  Man, I was waiting, guys.  I had a lot of fun.  You had a good time, right? 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, thanks for all the booze and stuff.  How's your girlfriend's goat?  How's my girlfriend's goat?  Yeah.  Yeah, good.  Hey, Steve, I heard you had to ditch her that night.  Yeah, I really actually did have to ditch her that night.  Have you seen her?  Is it true she was naked with a knife?  She was...  Nah, was she naked with a knife?  She woke me up at knife point.  Nice relationship. 
[02:04:00]  A little bit of danger, a little edge.  She was like, she just had the knife just because she wasn't really like...  Hey, Steve-O, I've got to introduce everyone.  You know Dennis Leary?  Yeah, what's up, Dennis Leary?  How are you?  And Adam Farrar.  How are you, Steve-O?  They're on the show The Job, which is on tonight at 9.30 on ABC.  Oh, okay, killer.  Yeah.  Don't say killer.  See, we were watching your DVD, and you're really...  I'm really doubting your sanity. 
[02:04:30]  When you lit your head on fire, your hair, and then had...  Here's the thing.  He put some...  What did you put in your hair first?  Hairspray.  He put a hairspray in his hair.  He lit it on fire.  He lights his hair on fire.  And a guy...  What did the guy have in his mouth?  Alcohol or something, right?  Yeah.  And then went...  Blew a huge plume of fire at Steve-O's head, which then completely was engulfed in flames.  There's no pool around or anything. 
[02:05:00]  So he does a backflip, tries to pull the shirt over his head, and puts the fire out with his shirt.  And he's got skin flaking off of his face where he burns himself.  Yeah, by the time I had my face, all the fire put out, like...  I was holding all the skin from my face rolled up in a joint.  Like, you know what I mean?  I was like...  The skin rolled off of his face.  Wow.  Steve-O, we got to ask you about the vodka IV.  Yeah, okay.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha. 
[02:05:30]  He took an IV bag.  Yeah.  But five shots...  This is all on his DVD of the stuff you can't...  They won't show on our TV.  Yeah.  Five shots of vodka in it.  Yeah.  And then proceeded to put it in his vein and walk outside across the street to a bar in a hospital gown,  wheeling an IV full of vodka, going directly into his bloodstream over to the bar.  Wow.  Yeah, that was awesome.  Steve, are you a college graduate?  Yeah.  I graduated from Ringling Brothers Barman Bailey Crown College. 
[02:06:00]  No kidding.  Yeah, I really did, yeah.  Wow.  They must be real happy about you now representing them.  Awesome.  I mean, like, I didn't get a contract, though.  Yeah.  Hey, Steve-O.  You don't need a contract right now, my friend.  Steve-O.  Yeah.  We were just kind of going over the DVD before the show, and the other thing that just killed us once again  was you eating the squirrel on the skewer and the possum still.  And the boiled possum.  Yeah.  Hilarious.  He couldn't get any down.  He just started projectile comedy. 
[02:06:30]  And you see it.  I mean, his face is going...  He starts heaving, and then...  Like a fire hose.  I was getting the dry heaps just looking at that possum in the pot.  It had the head on it and everything.  The meat was falling off of the head.  It looked tender.  It looked like it was prepared very nicely and tender.  And the meat was falling off of the skull with those huge possum teeth.  And he takes a big chunk of meat off of this thing, puts it in his mouth, and then just 
[02:07:00]  bop, just projectiles off it.  Peebo, how long did it take before you realize, man, this is not going to stay down?  Like seconds, right?  Yeah.  It was kind of on the idea of it.  What made you puke?  Yeah, was it the idea of the smell and the taste?  I think it was...  I was feeling kind of like I was when I was on your show.  Oh, so maybe it was the alcohol.  Yeah, that might do it.  Of course, his head had been on fire.  He was still recovering from the IV bag full of booze that made him puke.  He's still recovering from New York.  Then he comes in, and he does like three or four things for us. 
[02:07:30]  He slices his tongue with a piece of glass.  He takes a light bulb, breaks it, takes a sharp piece of it, cuts his tongue.  Bad.  Where it just, it's bleeding profusely, and it's not a trick or a gag.  The guy cuts his tongue.  Then he pops the glass in his mouth and chews it, like a potato chip, and swallows it.  Yeah.  By the way, we got the audio of him just chewing the glass.  All right.  Bye, my guy.  Holy Jesus.  I'm so into the water. 
[02:08:00]  That rocks.  Now, the key is in having it still be crunchy when I swallow it off.  Are you ready?  Are we getting the crunch back here?  I'd sting your tongue a little bit.  All right.  You got some fun.  I'm glad to be here.  Wash it down with tequila.  More tequila.  On that tongue.  That's good.  Gargling with tequila, by the way.  Wow.  Steve-O, that was...  Steve-O, what's in the future for you?  What do you think of your...  Death.  Huh?  Yeah, I would think.  That's a good question. 
[02:08:30]  You know, Steve, if you went to an AA meeting and told the stories, nobody would believe you?  Yeah.  They would say, get out of here, you're making a mockery of our...  Well, they've got to tell these guys about the showstopper.  Oh, yeah, then...  What's the showstopper?  Well...  The turtle.  The turtle.  The turtle.  We've all, like, messed with our junk where you make it kind of...  You kind of...  You grab it and then push on the end and it goes in like a turtle head going away.  You know, you take your...  I've got better things to do with my Steve-O, don't you?  Then you take the skin from your, let's just call it yam bag... 
[02:09:00]  Yes.  ...and pull it up over the whole thing you just pushed in.  So now, it's a complete covering like you're a Ken doll.  Right?  Now, it's not going to stay like that, Dennis, right?  You let go, it's going to snap right back.  Yeah.  Unless you take an industrial stapler and staple it to your lower abdomen.  Yeah.  Well, you've got to have your topless girlfriend do it, though.  Yeah.  So, he stapled right through the skin on his bag into his...  70s bush.  Yeah, 70s bush. 
[02:09:30]  And then it was staying right there.  Well, hold on, guys.  We've got an audio clip.  Yes, Dennis?  We have an audio clip.  You know, there's a reason people have hobbies.  All right.  He's down.  His...  He's completely gone.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  All right.  Wait a minute.  I just know.  The top was in front of Steve-O.  Steve-O's upside down.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  That makes you cringe.  That's one of those things where a guy will just grab it, lean over forward, and go, ah. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Steve-O, man.  Steve, you're a talented guy.  I'm really having a lot of fun.  Boss, don't get any ideas for an episode.  I ain't doing that.  The mortar shell in the back of your car is hysterical.  Right on.  Like, the anticipation when you light it, and you start driving away, and you know it's  lit, so it's coming, but you don't know how bad it's going to be.  Yeah.  You go like, oh, crap.  You know, like, he's like, oh, no.  Like, he's lit.  Oh.  And then just, boom.  You see fire in his backseat. 
[02:10:30]  The whole inside of the car is engulfed in smoke.  He throws it in par, steps out and goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Comic genius.  You're a classic.  We're just glad you're alive, Steve-O.  What are we doing writing all this stuff?  Yeah, we've got to get Dennis one of his DVDs.  Uh-huh.  We've got to get Dennis one of these DVDs.  Yeah, you do.  We have one laying around?  Oh, you'll laugh your ass off watching this.  Twisted.  Give him the one that Ant's got.  We'll replace that.  Yeah, I got one at home.  You've got to take this out.  Oh, yeah, I definitely want this. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, right on, Dennis.  I appreciate that.  I think you might enjoy it.  I definitely will enjoy it.  And it's stevovideo.com, and there's a link on our website if you want to order the DVD.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, man.  So, I was doing great, and so I ran out of drugs.  Did you get some more?  Yeah, that's always a rough time, isn't it?  Yeah.  I got to say, New York's got some pretty good drugs.  Yeah?  Does it?  Yeah, please.  At one point, you came in here, and I couldn't figure out how you got so much snow under your nose on such a warm day here in New York. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, well, where there's a will, there's a way.  Oh, yeah.  The mayor's glad to hear that, too, by the way.  Exactly.  Well, take care of yourself, man.  Hey, for sure, man.  Thanks again, guys.  Hey, tell the goat we said hi.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do, man.  We'll do.  All right.  And keep in touch, all right?  Yeah, for sure.  I'll check in from time to time with when he's stunned.  Cool, Steve.  Hey, thanks a lot, everyone. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  Peace.  Later.  Where is Steve?  Who's going to go first?  I think he's back in L.A.  Who's going to go first?  Him or Buddy Epson?  I would say Steve O.  Jeez.  The guy, you cannot do that and not die.  He's crazy.  He has no fear.  He was driving across a bridge.  I don't even know where that was.  Oh, go ahead.  He's standing on top of a car.  One of those low, not even that low, but it's not a suspension bridge.  It's just a bridge like you see in the Keys or something.  It had to be about 25 feet.  In Florida.  From the water.  Between the Keys.  Stuff like that.  And he's driving, somebody's driving him, he's on the roof of the car, and he just jumps 
[02:12:30]  off of the roof of the car into the water.  He goes, I wanted to be a stuntman, but he doesn't finish the story.  I'm like, what happened that you weren't?  I wanted to do those drugs, and you know, you'll...  All right, Steve, this is what happens when you go to clown college, kids.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  What happened that he couldn't be a clown?  We hang around with midgets too long, you know what I mean?  We've got to stay at midgets again.  Still taking the crazy stuff to do.  Yeah, we've got to take another parade.  Ah, damn it.  It sucks. 
[02:13:00]  You guys still staying?  Yeah, we'll stay.  I'll stay at about 6.  Cool.  Well, that means we've got to say goodbye then.  No, we'll say goodbye at 6.  Yeah, we'll come back.  We'll come back, and we'll say goodbye to Dennis Lee and Adam Farrar.  The job's on tonight at 9.30.  Check it out.  It really is.  It's a great...  9.30.  Trust us on that.  Hey, can we play that John Madden thing?  Where's Rick?  What John Madden thing?  This is funny, too.  Yeah, this is pretty funny.  I like John Madden.  You're going to love this.  The clips.  John Madden's like you've never heard him.  Oh, really?  In a context you've never heard him before.  He's in a car with a mortar.  Yeah.  Keep your headphones on for this one. 
[02:13:30]  Check this out.  It's coming to the Gay Channel.  What is up?  It's the second annual male group orgy competition.  And he hits the hole right after Jesse opens it up.  With your hosts, John Madden and Pat Summerall.  And then everyone's kind of slopping around down there and grunting and groaning.  And, you know, you get mud and stuff flying and gang tackles and scrums and quagmires.  No fems, fats, or hairies.  Just the hunkiest gay studs in wild group action competition. 
[02:14:00]  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Don't get carried away, John.  There was all kinds of stuff flying around there.  It's male group sex to die for, as described by the best play-by-play team in the biz.  Yeah, that was the white one.  That one didn't come and didn't come and didn't come.  And finally, they threw it out of there.  Whoop!  I don't know where that one came from.  Look at that big old butt.  Oh, what a meal those guys are having.  They look good.  That's a good group.  If you go nuts for tight butts...  You push, you push, you push... 
[02:14:30]  Get Gaper View today!  He just rode him backwards.  Just put him right on his back.  With Pat Summerall and John Madden.  That looked like it was the last shot out of the Roman candle.  The second annual male group orgy competition on Gaper View.  I'd like to pack that guy around, too.  Boy?  Yeah?  He's gonna fire into his guy right here.  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE to order today.  Хорошо.  Well, it's 6 o'clock, Ant. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, 6.  That means we gotta say goodbye to Dennis Leary in a few minutes here.  I was hoping he would be around for the 6 o'clock.  Oh, it's 6 o'clock, Anthony.  It's 6 o'clock, what?  It's 6 o'clock.  You're gonna have to stick around for a few more minutes.  Don't tell him. 
[02:15:30]  What is it?  Just a couple of minutes.  Ladies...  Give us a couple more minutes, Dan.  Ladies, please.  Look, on today's...  This is a unique circumstance.  Even if you've already done it...  That's right.  ...on the show, call up.  He's a big star.  We're trying to impress him.  Yeah.  Please.  He might invite us on the set or something someday if he remembers all the cool things we gave him.  Ladies, call immediately.  Yeah, please, help us out.  Take one for the team.  In the meantime, Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hello.  I just wanted to give a heads up to Dennis over there for putting that thing on every year in Worcester. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, thanks.  Thank you very much.  You know, I think it's a real good thing that you do that.  For the firemen, man.  It's a firefighter's foundation, yeah.  Right, yeah.  He runs a good show over there all the time.  There's enough money for him.  Fun time.  Hey, guys, how do I get in on the Clam Fest there in Boston here?  The Clam Fest.  Well...  Do you have a shellfish allergy?  Hey, we're going to be broadcasting live from WBCN Friday.  Yeah.  I guess you just show up in the station.  Just show up, man.  And right around 3, we're going to have some type of lottery.  We're going to get 10 contestants, and you want to take it from here and again? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, after we pick the 10 contestants, we bring them inside.  We're going to have a bunch of clam chowder.  So you're looking for the guy with the biggest stomach, or what?  No, no.  Each guy is going to have to eat a big bowl of clam chowder every 10 minutes, and the  last person that pukes up that luscious chowder is going to be going to the Super Bowl.  Yeah, my girlfriend's pregnant.  Can I bring her?  What a lamp.  Oh, yeah.  She's going to love to see people puke.  I can be her sponsor.  She's going to have the kid right there.  Yeah.  No, you have to puke.  There's a lot of puking.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, hey.  You've got to be the last guy standing.  She'll be the last girl standing.  All right.  Well, just show up at the stage.  Yeah, she's eating for two.  That's what I'm talking about.  All right.  Yeah, be good.  Okay.  All right.  Are you a big Pats fan, Dennis?  Typical Boston guy.  No, I'm not a Patriots fan.  I'm a Green Bay Packers fan.  Yeah, but now, unfortunately, because of the twisted world that we live in, I have to  root for the Patriots because I don't want the Rams to win.  That's right.  No one really wants the Rams to win.  No.  I don't want the Rams to win.  I think even the people that aren't Pats fans, speaking of soup, a chunky soup quarterback 
[02:17:30]  that they have.  Oh, God.  Kurt Wana.  Kurt Wana.  Kurt Wana.  Wana.  I hate the Rams.  I hate the uniforms.  I hate everything about them.  Yeah.  The L.A. Rams.  Yeah.  It's L.A.  So, forget it.  I don't care what city they're in.  Here's what I'm rooting for.  I'm rooting for Brady starts and his arm is torn off early in the first quarter and Bledsoe  comes in and leads the Patriots to a gigantic victory and then it just goes on a huge, gigantic  Coke and booze fender and gives the Patriots a finger and signs with somebody else. 
[02:18:00]  See, these are my secret evil plans.  That would rock.  I look forward to the Super Bowl but also the arrest afterwards.  Right.  Everything that comes afterwards.  Yeah, the rape charges, everything.  I'm a total footballer.  Maybe he can go to a light bulb, cut his tongue open.  He can go to some big blast at a bar and mosh and stage dive onto some poor girl.  Do that again.  Paralyze somebody.  Yeah, why not?  He's famous for it.  It's all good, clean fun.  Tonight, Drew Bledsoe, live on our stage. 
[02:18:30]  I'm going to bite your ankle.  I thought that was great to watch him come in last week.  How did that watch?  Yeah, that was something.  Because he sucked it up and never said anything negative all season and this kid Tom Brady has  got a big smile on it.  God love him.  He's winning, he's winning, he's winning.  But his ankle.  You know something, though?  I know Ben over here.  He's a huge Pats fan.  I was at home watching the game and the second Brady got hurt and they brought Bledsoe in,  I'm like, I could hear, if I'm quiet enough, I could hear Ben screaming no all the way  in Brooklyn.  Yeah, but one of the team has a backup quarterback like Drew Bledsoe. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  The guy's got an arm like a cannon.  He did the job.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  By the way, it's 6-0-4.  Hey, Mike.  Come on.  Hey, Dennis.  What?  I just wanted to thank you for the three greatest lines in comedy history.  What are they?  Life sucks, get an effin' helmet.  Yeah.  Capital N, small y, big effin' Q.  Yep.  And the ever popular, shut the eff up next.  Yep.  When I hear that, I think of conversations I've had with my mom over the last 20 years.  I try to make people think of their mom when I do stuff like that. 
[02:19:30]  I love life sucks, get a helmet.  That is one of my faves of all time.  Yeah, well, I like all of them.  All right.  That's why I say them.  Thank you, Mike.  Thanks, Mike.  It's now 6-0-5, and Dennis has places to go, ladies.  Yeah, I got places I gotta go.  Help us out.  Come on, girl.  Andy.  Yo.  What's going on?  We're back in Cleveland with Andy.  It's girl number three.  It's Ann.  She's a redhead.  Wait, there's the third girl coming down today alone?  Yeah.  And no ladies in New York once again today. 
[02:20:00]  Where's the picture?  Can we see a picture of her?  They're working on getting the ladies.  Short red hair, smoking body, tan, tattoos.  Andy.  Wow.  I gotta call you out on something.  Does she have a goat?  Yeah, real.  Totally real.  Good, good, good.  We can't quite use that T word as much as...  What did you say, can?  We're using it.  Andy, I'm calling you out on this.  You don't sound as excited as the last time you called us.  Yeah.  Oh, I can't.  They got somebody in here watching me,  so I have to be careful with what I say now.  Oh, really?  Who's watching you?  The Pope? 
[02:20:30]  Well, listen, Ann, say hi to these guys.  Dude, you guys, say hi.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Very good.  How are you?  I'm okay.  Are you going to get naked in these pictures?  No nakedness.  That's okay.  Half naked, though.  Half naked, good.  Which half?  How about you just cover your face and arms?  Just make sure you cover your junk.  All right, Andy, we look forward to the pictures, all right? 
[02:21:00]  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, Andy.  That was a guy.  I know.  It wasn't a great voice.  It wasn't a great voice.  John, what's up?  I have a bubble full of confetti.  Hey.  I wanted to tell Dennis one more nice quote.  Yeah.  Okay?  I'm Isaac.  I have my teeth degree.  Merry, effing Christmas.  Yeah, there you go.  That's a good one, though.  That's a good one, though.  You're going to watch NyQuil, man.  You're going to watch the job tonight?  I think so.  You mean you think so?  You think so?  You better.  I am.  I'm sorry.  9.30 tonight.  All right, bye.  Dennis just gave you two hours of great radio.  You've got to at least watch the job tonight.  Check out how good the show is. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, next week as well with Gina Gershon in her underwear.  Yeah.  Come on.  You know, I've been stalling, and it looks like the ladies are letting us know.  Yeah, we're not going to get the six o'clock.  Well, guys, I guess next time we're going to have to have that Chinese naked midget for Lenny.  Someone better remember the movie.  Absolutely.  Chinese naked midget.  C-N-M.  Okay?  The C-N-M network.  Can you bring the Hasidic midget for us?  Oh, if we can find it.  Yeah.  That was hysterical.  Calling all midgets.  What we missed out on sharing with you is the six o'clock queef. 
[02:22:00]  It is a girl calls up, and without getting into any detail, because any detail is bad,  she takes her phone, and we hear a wonderful queef.  I think I know what that means.  Yeah.  It kind of makes everyone happy.  It sounds like this.  Oh, oh.  Hold on, Ant.  Oh, what?  No, stop it.  Chrissy?  Yeah?  What are you calling for?  The six o'clock queef.  And where are you calling from? 
[02:22:30]  Cleveland.  All right, hold on the line.  We got an intro song in a minute.  Yeah, we got to do our theme.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart, it's six o'clock,  it's time for a queef.  Blow out the candles, make a wish, it's like a fart, but smells like fish, it's six o'clock,  it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor, test up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  All right, Chrissy, are you ready?  I think so, yeah.  Okay, everyone be quiet.  You've got to listen. 
[02:23:00]  Everyone.  Shh.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, go.  Do you hear it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's not a burp, it's not a fart, it's not too sweet, it's not too tart, it's six o'clock,  it's time for a queef.  Thank God.  Blow out the candles, make a wish, it's like a fart that smells like fish, it's six o'clock,  it's time for a queef.  Undo your pants, let them drop to the floor, test up and let yourself roar. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, a queef.  Thank God.  Great timing, guys.  Isn't that good?  Unbelievable.  You like the comedy timing?  You guys are clutch.  Dennis, where else are you going to find something like that?  Seriously, clutch.  Somebody called us from Washington one day and said, look, I don't like your show because  you don't have enough featured items, you're not formatted enough.  And we took that to heart and added things like the six o'clock queef, where somebody on  any given day can know that at six o'clock, goddammit, they're going to hear that queef.  Yes, you know what?  You're right. 
[02:24:00]  You guys are unbelievably organized people.  Exactly.  You're formatted to a T.  Right.  Anybody can get a cuckoo clock.  Come on.  News?  We don't need news.  No.  Al, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to kiss Dennis' ass.  First of all, love you and the Thomas Crown Affair.  Oh, man.  Definitely checking out the job tonight.  And you rule being a Packers fan.  All right, Al.  They love you on Venus.  That's where he's calling from.  Calling from an avalanche.  Goddamn cell phones, man.  Hey, Chachi's checking in from Boston. 
[02:24:30]  Chachi.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, man?  What's up?  Very, very proud to announce we have two partially clad ladies in the conference room.  Oh, thank God, Boston.  With wild bumper stickers on their left-wing breast.  Partially clad.  Partially clad.  That's a good name for a band.  Partially clad.  We have Natasha and Adrian.  Nice.  Natasha.  They are commemorating the number 12 Tom Brady jersey on their lovely butts. 
[02:25:00]  Oh.  And some good photos.  So we're going to send them off to you guys.  We're very happy.  Our first two contestants.  Thank God, Boston.  Austin finally representing the Naughty Nighty contest.  Hey, Chachi, are you ready for the chowder competition?  Very ready.  Legal Seafood is providing us the chowder.  Oh.  We are psyched.  We got a foosball game for you guys.  We got all that stuff.  It's retarded.  It's going to be retarded.  It's retarded.  A wicked bizarre.  Bizarre.  If you want in on the chowder competition, your chance at the Super Bowl tickets, you've 
[02:25:30]  got to just show up at the station at 3.  You know something?  I've been to Legal Seafood, and that chowder there, so creamy, rich, rich, and thick.  It's great puking material.  Oh, you will love it.  When it comes back up, you're talking about spray painting at that studio.  Oh, yeah.  Now, listen, boys.  I'm starting with 40 gallons of chowder.  40 gallons.  40 gallons of chowder.  That's the title album, the newly titled album from Poshly Clad.  It's a hot new band out of Boston. 
[02:26:00]  40 gallons of chowder.  Damn it.  Do you want to talk to these ladies at all, or are you upset?  I throw them on a couple of seconds.  Poshly Clad.  Do you want them?  Natasha?  Yeah.  Natasha.  Natasha.  Natasha's wearing a lovely little thong thing going on there below the hoes.  Come on over here.  They want to talk to you.  Come on.  O&A wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Which one are you?  Okay, here's Natasha.  She sounds like she's six.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  You having me on? 
[02:26:30]  Hey, Natasha, how old are you?  I'm 21.  Yeah.  Oh, bold.  Are you in college up there?  Yeah, I am.  Where do you go to college?  I go to a small Catholic college.  Oh, isn't that nice?  You should have bought the uniform.  Yeah, well, I went to Catholic high school, too.  Oh, really?  You should have brought the uniform.  We should have, actually.  I went to Catholic high school.  And now I'm with the devil.  Would you like to meet the devil?  Yeah.  Natasha.  So, well, great.  They're going to take your picture, put them up on the side. 
[02:27:00]  You feeling confident, are you?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And what about your pal?  She's right here.  You want to talk to her?  Yeah, throw her on.  Okay.  Thank you, John Bonet.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  What's your name?  Adrienne.  Where are you from?  Weakfield, Mass.  Yeah.  How old are you, Adrienne?  I'm 21.  Yeah, right.  I am.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Well, teen would be better, but 21, okay.  We like the 21, too.  Good, good.  That's good.  Just legal.  One of our favorite ages.  Yeah.  All right, and you think you look good enough to be a contender? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, actually.  I'm pretty damn good for somebody else.  I could be a contender.  A contender.  What are you wearing right now?  What do you have on right now?  We have a couple of wow stickers on.  Oh, that's it?  Over the top section?  Yes.  And then the bottom, what are you wearing?  Stickers.  A thon.  A thon?  Stickers.  Stickers.  Stickers, yeah.  That's sort of a naughty nightie.  Okay.  Yeah.  What do you look like?  They're making do with the materials.  Well, the two of us kind of look similar.  Oh, really?  Actually, we both have blonde hair and light eyes. 
[02:28:00]  Can you guys make out and stuff?  No, we're not going to make out.  We've been asked to do that for money, but we still haven't done that.  How much were you offered?  A lot of money in that field.  I was going to say, that means you can make a lot of money if you're offering.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  If they're offered money, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  Usually, you don't want pigs to make out.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do, actually.  Man, Norton.  Just a thing.  Coming from Norton.  You do.  Thank you.  You do.  Where's Chachi?  Hold on one second.  All right.  Chachi. 
[02:28:30]  What's the matter?  Nothing.  Everything's good, Chachi.  Yeah.  They're pretty hot, baby.  Let me tell you something.  Okay.  I'm going to do something.  All right, Chachi.  Calm down.  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  All right.  We look forward to Friday's show.  We can't wait.  We can't wait either.  We're going to email you these photos, and we're all set to go.  It's going to be the big puke-off on Friday.  Let's puke.  Make sure you...  Let's puke.  Hey, Chachi, you're going to have to get a tarp.  I'm telling you now.  We've got it all covered.  Let's tap.  We've had these puking contests, and they get a little messy.  Tap. 
[02:29:00]  Let's puke.  Tap.  Okay, boys.  All right, Chachi.  See you Friday.  See you.  All right.  And one more call before we say goodbye to Chachi.  We've got a site for the Boston road trip.  Yeah.  It's going to be cool.  You guys want to go?  We feel like we hang out.  Yeah, we'll do one more.  We've got to roll.  Anyone going to be up in Boston?  Yo.  Hey.  Dude, we had this hottie named Anna come down last night during my show.  We did a photo shoot with her for you guys.  Chris is on in Sacramento.  Sacramento.  After us.  Yeah.  He's going to take it.  I'm telling you what.  You're saying this girl's going to win the whole competition.  Yeah.  She's a hottie.  She's 18, and she lost to Virginia at 13, too. 
[02:29:30]  Ooh.  To a 12-year-old kid in the Bronx.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, I've never been in Sacramento, so don't look at me.  Wow.  All right.  Make sure...  I'm telling you, she's a hottie, dude.  The pictures just got sent, so look for them right now.  I haven't seen any new pictures up since the show started, and I'm a little disturbed  by this.  No, it's okay.  They'll be up a little later.  When is the end?  You go to OpenAnthony.com.  When's the end of the contest?  We don't know.  Five years from now.  15 years later.  We'll be going, when is time for... 
[02:30:00]  Buddy Epson's going to win.  Stephanie's 45, and the winner of our new...  The winner is Angelica.  Yeah, the grand prize is for Hedonism 3.  It might be Hedonism 23 by the time we're done.  Who the hell knows?  Yeah.  All right, Kid Chris.  Thanks, bro.  Keep rocking in Sacramento for us, man.  Bye.  Later.  Bye.  There he goes.  I think these guys...  I hate that out.  Yeah, we got out, man.  Dennis Lurie.  All right, guys.  Adam Ferrara.  Tonight at 9.30, next week, Gina Gershon in her underwear. 
[02:30:30]  Very psyched to see that.  Partially clad.  Partially clad.  Partially clad.  Gina Gershon.  9.30 on Wednesday.  Shout out.  You laugh like you're hurling chatter.  These guys just gave us two and a half hours of great radio.  So, you know, do us all a favor.  So, check out the job tonight.  You're not going to be disappointed.  And we'll bring Lenny Clark in it.  Oh, definitely.  And we will bring that Chinese midget.  Chinese midget.  Guaranteed.  Or you go home.  That's right.  If we don't have the Chinese midget, we won't go home.  We'll probably just hang around and make our lives miserable.  It's Dennis Lurie and Adam Ferrara. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Take care.  There's a car with a wow next to me.  Whip out your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  I'm willing.  You look fabulous.  Opie and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well done.  And E.W.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What a day, man.  Dennis Lurie was so effing cool. 
[02:31:30]  I got to say it.  Yeah, it was fun, man.  He was like one of the guys.  Just hanging.  It's not like a...  We get a lot of people in here.  And a lot of them have attitudes and stuff.  He was just one of the guys.  And we just had so much fun.  What a recoup from my first meeting with Dennis Lurie up in Boston.  I think it was two comics come home ago.  Remember?  He blew you off.  Totally blew me off.  And we told him that story, though.  Yeah, we dealt with that last time. 
[02:32:00]  But this time it's not like, you know,  Dennis, do your material or be like you are on stage or anything.  He was just hanging out.  It was really...  He really had fun, too.  A lot of fun.  Bobby, what's going on?  I just had to call and tell you.  That was the funniest freaking hours with Dennis Lurie up there, man.  Y'all were absolutely great.  It was a blast.  It was a great show tonight, man.  I'm driving through D.C., man, about to kill myself in my car.  It was absolutely hilarious.  And I'm like, there's my frigging friend hanging out with Dennis Lurie.  He's on a goddamn show on ABC with him. 
[02:32:30]  I will be watching it for tonight, if you're...  It really is a great show.  The job, 9.30 tonight, ABC.  It's good to see...  I will check it out, man.  You guys are great.  You know what?  It's interesting.  We had a typical Opie and Anthony show sandwich.  For the new cities, you've got to understand this.  New York Ori understands this.  Oh, yeah.  We usually follow up a really good show with a really sucky one.  Yeah.  And in this case, we went Steve-O.  Great show.  Yeah.  Yesterday, average at best.  And came right back with the Dennis Lurie, Adam Farrar thing today. 
[02:33:00]  Right.  A typical Opie and Anthony show sandwich.  I actually went to sleep last night, and the last few thoughts in my head was, oh, my  God, we did a goddamn top 20 list.  Like, I was disgusted with ourselves.  Well, that was more to just, I don't know, get conversation going.  And it got none.  Well, thank God we left out the top two.  Yeah.  We did that.  We had a stupid 20...  Thanks, Bobby.  Top 20 American albums as per Blender magazine. 
[02:33:30]  Well, it worked so well with the list from Spin.  We thought we'd try it again.  Yeah, Spin.  It was fun with the bands.  And then we get down to, like, we announced the third one, going to the last two, and just  said, you know, this sucks.  Screw it.  Didn't even tell the last two.  What was this?  Yesterday.  Oh, yes, then.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, you're right.  No, you didn't.  Just like that chick up in Philly, right?  Never happened.  No, didn't happen.  I got to say, too.  Yeah, but we did have the queef-off, which...  That was fun.  Okay. 
[02:34:00]  Which saved yesterday's show.  Absolutely.  If you were a trooper and hung in there with us the whole show, you got to pay off.  Hey, let me tell you.  Let me tell you.  You know, we're being a little too hard on ourselves, because I was at...  Hard on.  What?  I was at the Coliseum last night.  People loved the Tom Brokaw...  Oh, I forgot.  We did that, yeah.  What were they called again?  The Ashna?  Ashna.  The Ashna bit.  They loved that.  The young Ashna.  You hear about this?  So, we did 12 bits yesterday, and two were good.  How nice is it to see the job succeeding, like an edgy, good comedy with good comics, 
[02:34:30]  and the chamber got canceled.  Fire it off, you rip-off artist.  Shaheed.  Hey, what's up?  O&A.  What's going on, guys?  Norton, one of the best comedians of this century, man.  Thank you, sir.  You got to go see him someday, man.  He's great.  He's great.  Listen, I want to kiss your ass a little.  I've been listening for about two and a half years now, out of New York.  For real?  Yeah.  Yeah, go.  Oh, thanks, man. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, but...  We were trying to make you feel at home.  A little Oz music.  Oh, yeah, thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you, yeah.  When I hear somebody asking about kissing another man's ass, I'm just...  Whoa.  Slow down, baby.  Slow down, baby.  A little Oz music, man.  Hey, listen, Schillinger.  What's up?  Get over there and whoop your white ass, Schillinger.  We're just trying to relate to the community.  Hey, at least Schillinger ain't taking it in the back door.  He's giving it. 
[02:35:30]  Wow.  Well, I want no part of that, man.  No, believe me.  That show has completely scared me away from any life of crime I may have thought.  But you know what?  I don't want it.  As much junk as they do on that screen, man.  I can't stop watching that show, man.  It's a great show.  That show on HBO.  Ben, did you finally see last week's...  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You know something?  Did you see that cocktail?  Yeah.  At one point, the guard that got his Achilles tendon sliced because he was going to play the  basketball game, he comes back to work.  He's miserable. 
[02:36:00]  I mean, he had a promising basketball career, and he ends up back at Oz as one of the screws.  So, one of the convicts goes, hey, you want a drink?  He goes, oh, yeah, well, are we going to go out for a beer?  He goes, no.  How about a, and the derogatory term for urine, crap, puke, blood cocktail?  He throws a bucket of it in his face.  Oh, wait a minute.  You know who threw the cocktail, right?  That's Madonna's ex-boyfriend there.  Oh, what's that?  That's the father of her baby.  Leon something?  Yeah, Carlos Leon. 
[02:36:30]  Carlos Leon, he's got a really good build, good legs.  Oh, well, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, why don't you bring this up in the office?  We had our contest for the Super Bowl tickets.  Hey, listen.  Hey, guys, I got to get off, man.  Let's do this chowder thing.  Hey, listen, guys, I got to get off, man.  But, yo, great show, man.  Thank you, man.  Keep it up, guys.  See, we've softened our delivery, and the brothers are coming, and they're starting to  listen to the show.  What show are you listening to?  We've softened our delivery, my friend.  We're a little more user-friendly with the ladies and the shwoogies.  Oh, my God. 
[02:37:00]  You just totally negated.  Oh, did I say negated?  Anything that we, any headway we might have made.  Shwoogies means...  You're going to spook them.  Oh, Jesus.  Hold on.  Now, see, you don't know how to do comedy.  That's not funny.  I have to...  Stay out the bushes.  That's not funny.  Stay out the bushes.  See, we know how far to take it.  Can you just stop monkeying around?  All right, stop.  Oh, look, look, look.  Look, Opie didn't say that, and Anthony said it.  That, see, we know...  Oh, my God.  That's why it's still called the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:37:30]  We're responsible broadcasters.  Stay out the bushes.  For the record, shwoogie's not even a word.  No.  It's Brucey Mittman.  Boy.  All right, stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Quiet.  Yeah, exactly.  Quiet.  Exactly.  Quiet.  Exactly.  Quiet.  Exactly.  Quiet.  Exactly.  Quiet.  Exactly.  I can just do that all day.  You know my OCD, too.  I'll do it forever.  Quiet.  Exactly.  Quiet.  Exactly.  Quiet.  Exactly.  Quiet. 
[02:38:00]  What?  What?  All right.  Look at Chris from Manhattan.  I learned little Gary's only worthy of a Tampa Bay game.  You totally blew that kid off, man.  We don't like to give all our secrets, but don't worry.  Gary's going to an Islander game.  People want to shoot me at this point.  I thought you were going to give him a fighting pigeon for your little ush.  Jim, we're a little ush now.  Jim.  Oh.  Hey, Jim.  Hello.  All right.  What's going on?  Well, not much.  We're closing up shopping a little bit. 
[02:38:30]  You called the show, and now we're waiting for you to say something.  Yeah, I know.  You need tickets?  For what?  Islanders Rangers?  Yeah, tonight.  Yeah, I do.  You do?  Yeah.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  What time are you going to head over there?  Like, in a few minutes.  Okay.  You're going to have to pick them up at the box office.  You really got tickets?  Yeah.  You can't use them?  No.  I go to most of the games.  You don't want to go to the Islander Ranger game?  Are you insane?  No.  Well, I live in Bohemia, so it's kind of a hike.  But I work out on the island, so it's too far for me tonight. 
[02:39:00]  Will I be able to get them?  Yeah.  I could just, I would have to call the box office if I could just leave your name.  Holy yes.  Hold on, all right?  Yep.  Jim, I'll make it up to you.  You can come down to the station any time you want.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  If that's for real, man.  Johnny Blue Ball's checking in from Jersey.  Why do people break Jay Moore's balls about movies?  I thought he was great in Harry Potter as Malfoy.  It's just Johnny Blue Ball's out of nowhere.  All right.  Mike has a great idea. 
[02:39:30]  The guy hung up.  Oh, man.  People are effing with me.  They know how bad I want to go to this game tonight.  Oh, I just got used really bad.  Yeah, you got totally.  I just got tooled.  That's what you get for leading on, the little fella, making him wait for a game.  Oh, I just got tooled.  Yeah.  I'll leave the tickets in your clique.  Oh, Mike, what's up?  Nothing much, yo.  I should have saw that coming.  What do you got, Mike?  Yo, you still got Patty's toenails, right?  Yes, we do.  All right.  They are disgusting toenails.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  Toenails in general are pretty gross, but a stalker Patty just puts it in a whole  new level.  Well, she has problems with her feet.  She's got hammered toes, and she had these big, thick, fungused toenails.  Like, it's a fungus that builds up under and on the nail that makes them, they look like  if you took a Frito's corn chips and put them on the end of her toes.  Those are her toes.  Big, gnarly, and in some places, they're black from the fungus.  And a podiatrist came in and had a professional set of clippers and cut these big, thick things 
[02:40:30]  off.  It was like, I was reminded of being a tin knocker.  Like, cutting through metal with my snips.  It's disgusting.  So, do you have an idea for the toenails there, Mikey?  Yeah, a little bit of math here.  You got ten competitors, right?  Yeah, for the chowder competition that we're doing in Boston when we broadcast live Friday,  yes.  Right, ten toenails.  All right.  Toenail competitor. 
[02:41:00]  Instead of the crackers, a toenail.  I can't even.  You know what?  We're going to take your idea, and we're going to just make it a little better.  All right.  Because it's all about wondering if it's going to be you that gets the toenails.  We know we have a 40-gallon, what, pot of chowder from Legal Seafood.  Yeah.  We're going to just kind of drop the toenails in.  Oh, God, man.  And you're just not going to know if you're going to be the one that comes up with the 
[02:41:30]  toenails.  As you're reading your polls and chowder.  I swear, I just got like.  What if they swallow it whole, though?  Just wondering if it's going to happen to you could really make this contest interesting.  Remember, it has caused the fungus.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Can the fungus live like that?  Oh, I'm sure it can.  Rick, make sure you pack the toenails.  We're taking them to Boston with us.  Probably growing mushrooms by now.  I can't wait.  Moss.  Thank you, Mike.  Yeah, and you also blew me off for what did I learn? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, what did you learn?  From yesterday.  Kandahar?  Yeah.  Taliban?  Good thing.  Gets the gay out.  It gets the gay out.  Boy, you should have just punched out Maverick.  Oh, come on.  Now you're in a flat spin and the goose is dead.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  All right, Mike.  You guys go.  Quiet.  Wow.  Quiet.  Wow.  Quiet.  Wow.  Quiet.  Wow.  Ask Anthony. 
[02:42:30]  I could do it all day.  I don't know.  I can annoy everyone in the room.  They will all leave and I will continue doing it.  Yeah.  What?  What?  What do we play?  What do we learn next, huh?  Yeah.  The dueling retards as we go to break.  Actually, it's one retard and one guy that likes to give up.  Frenchie and Marion.  Frenchie!  Yes!  How you doing?  Hey, how you guys been?  Two annoying bitches. 
[02:43:00]  Hey, goose crap.  Retarded hole bag.  You Canadian queer.  You annoying fat hole bag.  Are you from Canada?  I'm not from Canada, you twat.  Where's your home?  Do you have a home?  You down-seed-home twat horse.  Twat bitch.  You Canadian gay.  Shut up, you twat. 
[02:43:30]  Why don't you go fall into a big vat of careless things?  When I saw you the first time, I looked at you and said, she has to be the dumbest poor in the world.  Go find a park you could craft in.  Yeah, yeah, shut the head up, you whore.  You sound like a retard.  Why do I shut up?  The only thing you know is succeed, you whore bag dummy.  You sound like you're queer.  You must have a chromosome left over in the toilet every time you go to the bathroom.  Why don't you cross the river so the alligators can get you?  Shut up, man.  Go find a park you could craft in.  Yeah, yeah, shut the head up.  You look like a down-seed-home bitch when you're married. 
[02:44:00]  I don't know what kind of husband you have.  That's right.  Why don't you goddamn die already?  Why don't you die first?  I'll die after.  Die, die, get in the coffin and die.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. Line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime, 212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, we're running out of time.  A lot of fun today. 
[02:44:30]  Holy S. Andy calling from Cleveland again.  Andy.  Didn't pop down.  There we go.  Hey, Andy.  Yo.  What's up, man?  We got number four in here.  The fourth girl today alone, huh?  The fourth girl today.  Goddamn amazing.  And she's smoking.  Say hi to the guys.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's she smoking?  She's...  Nothing right now, but the outfit's looking really good. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  Can we talk to her for one second?  Yeah, go ahead.  What's your name?  Jennifer.  Have you ever been photographed since the world according to Garb?  No, I haven't.  All right.  John, lift down, Joe.  John, lift down, Joe.  You all ready?  You feeling good?  I'm feeling real good.  Oh, well.  Or her.  All right there, Andy.  All right, you guys.  Hey, thank Jennifer for us, okay?  Will do.  And we look forward to seeing her pictures later tonight on opiananthony.com. 
[02:45:30]  Awesome, guys.  The contest is shaping up, man.  If you can't see the pictures, watch our cooking show.  Oh, I'm taking pictures in a thong bikini.  It's wonderful.  And my hump decorated in some lace thing that I've slung over my shoe.  You can't say that.  Norton, what's wrong with you?  What is wrong with you? 
[02:46:00]  We didn't give you enough attention today.  It really made me laugh.  A lace number is wonderful.  As I lean over this pot of stew and my breasts fall right in.  Norton.  Sorry.  We paid too much attention to Dennis Leary, right?  And that's how he pays back.  I just didn't know if he could say that.  I figured I'd give it a shot.  The big C?  The big C, Tony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Yo. 
[02:46:30]  What's up?  I learned that I don't have to listen to the show tomorrow.  No.  He's going off the rules.  That's not the case all the time.  You guys suck.  And Norton really sucks.  All right.  But we're not talking about triple-decker sandwiches.  Just the regular kind.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned Andy from Cleveland exaggerates more than Voss's agent.  I know the struggle.  Thanks for using that line on our show, Dan.  Thank you.  We appreciate it. 
[02:47:00]  He's coming back to the fold.  Obviously, his shift has changed in his work life.  I guess so.  Thank you, Dan.  Nice to have him back.  Good to have you back, pal.  Well, Ron and Fez up next.  Yes.  Zeno from P.A.  And I learned there's a height requirement on the Holocaust roller coaster.  Jerry from Edison.  I learned by the time Opie takes Gary to an Islander game, he'll be able to drive himself  and pick up beer on the way.  And also, I'll never be able to watch the job again without thinking of naked Chinese midget. 
[02:47:30]  Uh-huh.  The job is on tonight.  We're telling you guys, it's a great show with Dennis Leary and our pal Adam Farrar.  Uh, Jersey Gary, I learned the decline of the midget population coincided with the Roe versus Wade decision.  He also learned fishes and touring.  And just because you're smoking doesn't mean you're cute.  Right.  Ted from Huntington.  Huntington!  I learned puking, always funny.  Danielle.  Uh, uh, is it Danielle or Daniel? 
[02:48:00]  I ask this every time.  From Alabama?  Syndication underground?  Uh, I don't know.  All right, well, I learned today that girls never want to hear suck it or I'll shoot.  And Al Mack, uh, from Clifton.  Put the Brewer bit away, Opie.  You're not going.  Go Rangers.  Bleacher Anthony says, uh, today I learned that some days we don't have to hear a cheap plug for eatabullet.com.  But you did it.  I was just reading it.  Yeah, I know.  What happened there? 
[02:48:30]  Wow.  This is a good one, too.  Anthony.  Yo, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Good.  I learned two things today.  Yeah.  One thing I learned, when Norton talks, tis better to be on hold.  Yeah.  And I can look, just seeing 12-year-old Gary in the next episode of Cheaters.  Imagine.  Norton, you rule.  Thank you, sir.  You're cheating on me.  Later.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what did you learn on the show today?  Uh, today I learned, I learned that Boston can have number 21.  Oh. 
[02:49:00]  Later, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Quiet.  Okay.  Quiet.  Okay.  Quiet.  Okay.  Quiet.  Okay.  What?  Quiet.  Okay.  Quiet.  Okay.  Quiet.  Okay.  Quiet.  Can we stop with that, please?  I told you.  I told you.  It kills me.  I can do it.  I like pressing the button.  I can do it until every single one you watch.  Tom Cruise should be taking you cross country.  He just doesn't get sick of something.  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:49:30]  Quiet.  Okay.  Quiet.  Okay.  Quiet.  Okay.  Mike, what's up?  Yo, I should have cut out after my thought of the day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yo, and also, season tickets for the Rangers.  However, I am either going to or have, you know, given away all my tickets for this year.  But next year, you're in, Anne.  I know.  You ass.  Get out of here.  Uh, Dixon.  Hey, boys.  How are you?  Good.  Dixon and Phil, you know what I learned today?  Huh? 
[02:50:00]  The 40 Gallons of Chowder is the next big album from Parshly Clad.  You guys suck.  Get their new hit album, 40 Gallons of Chowder, from Parshly Clad.  All right.  And their follow-up, three rights make a left.  Yeah, we can try it, Chris, here.  Teen Melanie is a grown-up, JonBenet Ramsey, from Sean from Rutherford.  Very good.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah.  Today I learned Angelica has a shot at winning the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Angelica! 
[02:50:30]  And one more thing.  Can we end with Angelica tonight?  Angelica!  Angelica!  Guys, I learned one more thing.  Yeah, go, Chris.  Everybody has to watch The Job tonight.  ABC 930.  There you go.  All right.  Later, guys.  And you can call us tomorrow and tell us if we're wrong, if that's not a really funny show.  Funny as hell, that show.  Yeah.  Good writing.  Dennis kills.  Adam kills.  Lenny Clark kills.  And then Dennis' little mistress there is a hot piece of ass from, what, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air?  Best comedy on television. 
[02:51:00]  Does not need the laugh track.  Watch for the famous Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  I've seen it.  All right.  Good.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  I have to say, in all honesty, the most realistic police show on television.  Forget what I'm hearing.  Forget everything.  That's what goes on every day.  It's nice to see something that isn't just a cutesy little sitcom.  And believe me, it is not just because my pal is on it, too.  Because he has been in some real crap shows.  And I'd be the first one to say, we keep it up.  We're going to be on that radio.  I hope so.  That would be fun. 
[02:51:30]  That's our goal.  Even if it's for five seconds as they're tooling around the city.  Yeah.  Radio on with O and A.  Look what Steve from Jersey learned.  That if you burn your head, you can roll the skin into a joint.  Steve-O teaching people.  Why don't we leave the fine people with Angelica?  Stick around for the last note of the song.  That's the keeper right there.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Who put the jam on the pussycat's tail?  Who put the grease on the banister rail?  Quiet. 
[02:52:00]  Who put cement in the scrubbing up bails?  Quiet.  Who broke the milk puddle out on the drive?  Quiet.  Who squeezed the goldfish until they aren't alive?  Quiet.  Who spilled their mommy's Chanel No. 5?  Quiet.  Angelica.  Could you shut up?  Friends of the Opie and Anthony Show stay at the Park Central Hotel here in Midtown Manhattan.  1-800-346-1359.
