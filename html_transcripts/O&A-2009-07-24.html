<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts commenting on the unusually quiet Friday atmosphere in their SiriusXM studio and the disappointing, cool, rainy New York summer weather.  They then reviewed listener feedback from the previous day's show, which featured extremely graphic content involving guest Bobo's involuntary ejaculations and easily-induced erections.  This included playing audio clips and discussing potential repercussions from the explicit material.  The discussion also touched upon executive producer Steve Carleese's extended sick leave, Ace Frehley's surprise guest appearance, and upcoming segments for their weekly "worst of" countdown show, highlighting controversial moments including the Bobo incident, healthcare discussions, dead pet stories, and their accurate prediction of Wendy Williams leaving her radio show.  The hosts then shared explicit details about their pornography preferences. This transitioned into a discussion about various television shows, including "Big Brother," "First 48," "Gangland," and "Crime 360," before returning to listener feedback and further details about the upcoming countdown show.  Bobby Lee was announced as a future guest.

The show continued with a discussion of a video showing LeBron James being dunked on by a high schooler, focusing on the NBA's attempt to suppress the footage. This segued into a humorous, crude critique of romantic comedy movie posters and their predictable plotlines, with callers suggesting alternative endings.  A New Jersey political scandal involving rabbis, mayors, and organ donation was briefly discussed based on a Twitter summary.  The hosts then launched into a lengthy debate about the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. and President Obama's response, with callers offering varied perspectives, including a fireman attending a slain police officer's funeral (who had donated his organs) and a Nebraska deputy sheriff recounting a disturbing murder case.  The segment concluded with reflections on human nature and competition.  Bobby Lee remained scheduled for a later appearance.

The Gates arrest and Obama's response remained a central topic, with caller Graham describing police officers as a "government-sanctioned gang," prompting a discussion about police respect and challenges faced in high-crime areas.  Jay, a black man from Ohio, shared his perspective on police interactions with African Americans, addressing racial profiling.  The hosts played clips of Obama's press conference and Jon Stewart's commentary, criticizing Obama's handling of the situation and suggesting it was a distraction from his healthcare plan.  They also played Sergeant Crowley's refusal to apologize and analyzed both men's statements.  The segment shifted to internal SiriusXM issues, including complaints about censorship of the "Bobo clips" and repetitive airing of the Obama/Crowley segments.  A humorous, sarcastic campaign ad imagining Anthony Cumia as president was aired, followed by a lengthy, playful comparison of behind-the-scenes employee E-Rock to various superheroes.  The hosts speculated about E-Rock's absence and his perceived influence. The segment concluded with further discussion of the Obama/Gates/Crowley incident and media coverage criticisms.


The show then took a chaotic turn with a focus on the impending departure of staff member Sam and the anxiety-inducing presence of "Stalker Patty," a frequent studio visitor.  Guest Bobby Lee's extreme anxiety, amplified by Stalker Patty's presence, became a major storyline.  The hosts made crude jokes about potential interactions between Stalker Patty and Bobby Lee, discussed Sam's job performance and potential firing, and gave away wrestling tickets. Bobby Lee's panic attack escalated, culminating in him revealing his discomfort and leaving the studio.  The segment included discussions of Mark Burley's perfect baseball game and off-color jokes.  A call describing Stalker Patty's body odor further intensified the raunchy tone. Stalker Patty herself participated, revealing her age (54) and virginity, contributing to the bizarre atmosphere. The segment concluded with further discussion of Bobby Lee's experience and past anxieties and pranks on the show.

The final segment centered on Stalker Patty's PlentyOfFish.com profile, analyzed by Opie, Anthony, and Bobby Lee.  They discussed details like her age (54), profession (barrister at Starbucks), interests, and dating preferences.  Her profile's humorous aspects, including her description as a "sincere person" and "animal lover," were highlighted, along with her lack of recent sexual activity attributed to past religious affiliation, and her ambiguous stance on having children.  Bobby Lee's reactions to Patty's profile and pictures, culminating in his panicked escape after seeing a partially nude image, were a comedic highlight.  The hosts repeatedly urged Patty to reveal more of herself physically.  The segment included sexually explicit jokes and comments about Patty's body.  The hosts and Danny attempted to craft a message to a male user on PlentyOfFish, further punctuated by crude jokes.  The segment concluded with commentary on Bobby Lee's outburst and the playing of a Joy Division song.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Friday!  Oh, Friday!  That went well.  And we're the only radio show broadcasting from this huge SiriusXM facility.  That's it?  Dude, I walk around Friday before the show, there's no one here!  It's a ghost town.  A massive broadcast facility, you would think there would be hustle and bustle.  At least some bustle.  At least some bustle.  And then later on in the day when people get a little more energy, some hustle. 
[00:00:30]  People bumping into each other in the hallways going,  Excuse me, excuse me, there's very important stuff going on.  Yes.  I gotta lay down some tape before my show this morning.  Yes.  Look at the halls, there's nobody.  A couple of our interns, that's it.  Interns walking up and down.  You take away the 30 people that work for us behind the scenes,  there would be nobody here.  There really are quite a few, aren't there?  How did that happen?  I don't know.  It used to be just you and I.  It used to be so easy. 
[00:01:00]  And like an intern that we said,  Alright, you produced the show.  That's it.  That's how it started.  I started hanging out.  I don't even know half these people anymore.  No.  So what's up with summer?  I got a summer cold, I got a sore throat.  This isn't supposed to happen.  A little scratchy.  In the summertime.  I get my sickness in the winter, like most people.  But now the good doctor that was on said the weather has nothing to do with it.  Oh, I understand that.  Yes.  I understand that.  Now what do you do?  What do you say?  What do you go?  Yeah. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, but...  But I get sick every time.  No, but what did he say about the cold and getting sick again?  He said you're indoors a lot more with a lot more people,  so the germs are festering indoors instead of spending time outside  because it's nice and sunny.  Yeah, but that's kind of what we're doing this summer.  Yeah.  Like, it's cold again.  Yeah.  It's almost August, and it's...  64 degrees when I was driving in.  I was debating t-shirt or long sleeve.  Yeah.  Usually this time of year, it's t-shirt and shorts. 
[00:02:00]  Not even thinking.  You don't have to look at the weather.  You retire your jeans and everything for a good month, month and a half.  Not this summer.  I have winter clothes in my closet that I usually turned over and, you know...  Yeah, no, no.  The summer clothes come out.  I haven't worn shorts here once, and I'm not going to anytime soon.  It's been raining in New York the last three days.  More rain.  Yeah, it's disgusting.  And if one more person tells me, well, we needed the rain.  Did we? 
[00:02:30]  We needed the rain.  How much do we need?  We needed the rain.  I've passed by some reservoirs in my day.  Enough with we need the rain, we don't need the rain.  Nature figures that shit out.  Makes flowers bloom.  Right.  You just sit...  What is a sprinkler?  Shut up.  You just sit in your seats and enjoy nature.  You're not part of the show.  You pay to see the show.  Just stay in your seats.  Stay in your seats, please.  Exactly.  Watch the show.  Just watch the show and shut up.  Don't tell me, meaning nature, that we need the rain.  Yeah.  You won't be participating. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  We are just spectators.  Have we ever run out of water in the reservoirs?  For some reason, though, they usually tell us we're very close to running out of water  a lot of times when it's hot.  But we just make it every time, right?  Yeah.  Actually, not even just make it.  Yeah.  Then it pours rain for 10 days and they go, oh, the reservoirs are full.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  You want some?  Who cares?  Come with your buckets.  Yeah.  Use as much water as you like.  It's supposed to rain the next 9 out of 10 days?  No.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:03:30]  Wow.  Wait, wait.  That is a very vague weather forecast.  I see a piece of a sun.  I see a lightning bolt.  I see a cloud.  And I see some rain sprinkles.  But I see the sun, too.  Well, scattered tea storms for today, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  That's deceiving, though.  Wow.  That means if it rains, you know, a quick thunderstorm for 5 or 10 minutes.  Somewhere.  Isolated.  Yeah.  It'll be fun.  It's like Florida weather without the hot temperature. 
[00:04:00]  Mm-hmm.  Like, we're getting in the 80s, kind of.  But every day in Florida, you see scattered thunderstorms, a chance of thunderstorms.  It's that humidity.  Yeah.  And then it goes away and everything's cool.  The streets steam for a while when the sun comes out.  And you're a sweaty mess.  I love those summer rains.  You just nailed it.  The streets steam.  And within five minutes, everything's completely dry.  It's dry.  It never happened.  And then you're like, did I imagine that it was just pouring all around me?  You're back outside.  It's nice.  But I mean, the sidewalks, the roads, completely dry. 
[00:04:30]  Even the dirt.  You're like, what?  How'd that happen?  I don't know.  Yeah, we're getting screwed this summer.  It better really go into September and October, some nice weather.  I hope we did shift the axis or something.  Mm-hmm.  Well, Rape Kid from Harlem, his phone call says, yesterday's show was so gay, even Al Q thinks  you're fags.  Oh.  Somebody else writes, please, no Bobo today.  Yeah.  See, the over-the-top stuff, people either love or hate. 
[00:05:00]  And that's exactly what I read all day yesterday.  People loving the show and people going, enough with Bobo.  But they listened.  But they listened, right.  And the whole thing is, what kind of over-the-top stuff do we do on a steady basis?  Not much anymore.  We really don't.  Actually, I thought we were going to get fired yesterday because I'm so not used to doing  over-the-top stuff anymore.  So I walked out of here going, all right, we have to be fired because that was just  crazy.  And then I was thinking to myself, you and I used to do that once a show. 
[00:05:30]  Well, maybe not the gay thing.  Spit on each other's dicks.  Right.  But over-the-top stuff, we did once a show.  I woke up yesterday from my little nappy after work, and I was like, did that really happen?  I was thinking to myself, did that really, was that our show?  It was horrible.  With Bobby Lee blowing on it.  Bobby Lee.  He's my new favorite, man.  He is out of his fucking mind.  I'll tell you.  The feedback on Bobby Lee was really strong. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  People like, this guy rules.  He'll do anything.  Make sure he comes back soon.  He is coming back soon.  He'll be in today.  Oh, wow.  That is soon.  A little later, but he'll be in today.  But I was trying, I don't know, I don't know where to begin with this.  Because kind of like you, I was horrified that it went down.  Yeah, yeah.  I really thought we'd probably, we might, you know, be in a bit of trouble or fired.  For real.  Yeah.  Because like I said, most days now we have to just kind of talk. 
[00:06:30]  We don't get to do all that.  We just bullshit about things.  We don't get to do all that crazy stuff anymore.  And then I found myself yesterday kind of just staying in my apartment all day.  And unlike you, I like to be out.  Yeah.  I like to be out there doing stuff.  And I just had this feeling I need to just stay indoors.  I just, yeah, I had like a creepy feeling walking on my truck yesterday.  I was like, oh, God, what did we do?  Like, what did we do?  Kenny and Jimmy were listening on the way to the airport.  Oh, my gosh.  Jimmy's playing the punchline in Atlanta this weekend. 
[00:07:00]  He already did one show last night.  And they said, bravo.  They thought it was hilarious.  It was so, so, ugh.  For the people that weren't listening, Bobo came in and, I don't know, the guys discovered  last Friday that he gets boners really easily.  Like, you could talk him into a boner.  Like, we have no problems, but it's not like when you're 14 or 15, you know?  Yeah.  For the most part.  This kid is like a 14-year-old man. 
[00:07:30]  The wind blows, and he's getting a boner.  I don't think I'd be able to be talked into a boner by a bunch of gentlemen.  You know what I mean?  It's like if a chick is talking hot to you and stuff, of course.  Yes.  But with a bunch of guys describing a girl and stuff like that, you're like, yeah, that's  hot.  That's, you know, whatever.  But he would just, like, get a boner, and then we'd stop and just instantly start talking  about, like, the Mets or something.  And then his boner goes away. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  And then talk about his girlfriend there, who he likes to call his girlfriend, Christine.  And he just gets the boner again.  Rock hard, throbbing.  Ridiculous.  Aching boner.  Two and a half inches of boner, by the way.  That looks like, as Bobby Lee said, it looks like it went to Vietnam.  That was great.  And then we'd talk about NASCAR, and it went right back down.  Yeah, right back down.  And then after a while of this up and down motion, I guess the prostate gets working. 
[00:08:30]  And it starts leaking clear stuff, which Bobby Lee could not help but want to blow on it.  Not blow it.  No, because we all were in the same place.  We were convinced this thing was ready to blow at any second.  Yeah, yeah.  And we thought it would be the funniest thing ever if this thing blew in front of a bunch of guys.  By the way, if you want to listen, this whole thing was done with Bobo. 
[00:09:00]  His pants weren't on.  Yeah.  He's standing here.  That kid isn't shy, huh?  No.  He's just standing here.  He'd awkwardly pull his shirt up and hold it under his chin and then pull his pants down to his knees but hold the waistline of his pants.  Because he wanted to pull his pants up at any second when the time was happening.  He did the same place thing.  What was the other thing he did, you said, just before the show?  Oh, God. 
[00:09:30]  The chanting?  No, what was he doing?  In the, it's in the, in that promo we played.  Yeah.  Oh, whatever.  Damn it.  I don't know.  Yeah, he was, oh, Bobo, someone's saying here, Bobo's moaning was really creepy.  Yeah.  Oh, that's what it was, yeah.  Because there was some, some naked girls on the computer monitor.  Yeah.  So he's looking at that and just going, oh, yeah, you want it, you want it for Bobo.  It was the sickest fucking thing.  And he never touched himself. 
[00:10:00]  No, no, he wouldn't.  He wouldn't touch himself.  He's like, Bobo, what'll happen if you just grab it and squeeze it?  He goes, and he wouldn't even answer what would happen.  He just went, uh, uh, I'm, uh, and for some reason he thinks.  Oh, God, what a mess that is.  For some reason he thinks he needs to save it.  Yes, he's saving it up.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  It's a little boner.  Everyone took video.  Everyone took video yesterday.  We don't even know where we're allowed to post this.  There's nowhere to put that. 
[00:10:30]  We don't know.  What is that?  For the personal home collection?  Here go the curtains again.  Jesus.  Enough with the curtains.  There's no one here on Fridays.  By the way.  Every time you guys close the fucking curtains, I feel claustrophobic.  You could shut that one, I guess.  The, um, oh, God.  Yeah.  Maybe we could get it.  I can't even watch.  I want curtains over my eyes for this one.  Can I have, I want eyeglasses with curtains on them.  Maybe we could get this footage on, uh, the big jumbotron in Times Square.  Oh, yeah, that'll be great. 
[00:11:00]  Unbelievable.  And then what's going on with, uh, I noticed, um, people peeking in the corners of the curtains.  Now, if something happens when someone peeks in and then turns around and tries to get  us in trouble, I swear to God.  It was all our people trying to watch it.  It was one of our idiot interns.  All right.  You know, from this vantage point, it's impossible to know, so.  Yeah, I know.  So you just see people peeking.  It's like the curtains are there for a reason, I guess.  If it was up to me, they wouldn't be, but.  Yeah.  Andrew from Albany, um, summed it up. 
[00:11:30]  Nothing funnier than an Asian man spitting on a retard's cock while he verbally rapes an innocent  girl.  Oh, you, you have that?  Oh, wow.  We got that clip.  If you want to hear him spitting on, uh.  Oh, yeah, of course we do.  Yeah, let's hear this.  Should I spit on it?  Yeah.  No.  Spit on it.  Are you out of your mind?  Let me spit on it.  Are you out of your mind?  Are you out of your mind?  Are you out of your mind?  Ready?  Ready?  Ready?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Are you out of your mind? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, great.  That is.  I need a napkin.  Get me a napkin.  I was laughing so hard.  I thought I was going to pass out.  That was so goddamn funny.  And, and Bobby says, um, he goes, yeah, I wasn't sexual or anything.  I wasn't spitting on it like that.  He goes, I was just spitting on it in anger.  Cause like, you know, when you just spit on somebody, he goes, that's what I did.  I spit on it in anger. 
[00:12:30]  The, the best visual that was, yeah.  The mind was when he was blowing on it, but he didn't want to get too close.  I guess we both said pretty much the same time as like lighting a firecracker and trying  to run.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Try to run away.  He was trying to get as close as he could to, you know, have an effective blow on it.  So the wind, the breeze gusts over his minuscule penis.  I really thought that's all it was going to take for this thing to just explode.  Yeah.  So then he would blow on it and then like pretty much run. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  He'd run away from it.  Also the, the clear stuff was on a, it was stringing like two feet long.  So when he'd, he'd blow on it, it would swing one way and he'd want to get out of the way  before it swings back at him.  It was the most bizarre fucking thing I think I've ever seen in this studio and I've seen  or in our studios during our, our tenure as the O.B.  and Anthony show.  And we've seen girls, you know, smoke out of their pussies.  Oh yeah. 
[00:13:30]  We've seen it all.  That was just really bizarre.  He spit on his dick.  You just hear.  And I'll tell you why the gay stuff and, um, and we're going to turn this thing around  finally.  What happened was when we were on regular radio, they took the girl out of, out of the equation  for our show.  Out of the mix.  They completely took the girl out.  We weren't allowed to have them topless anymore.  We certainly weren't allowed, uh, to have them smoking out of their vaginas, all that  stuff.  Yeah.  But for some reason, like we did like a, some kind of gayish bit with somebody and the lawyers 
[00:14:00]  over at that place were like, yeah, that's fine.  Yeah.  They didn't say, how is that fine?  But we can't get a girl naked in studio.  Yeah.  So then, then we went all in cause we were still trying to do edgy radio.  So also we went down this gay road.  It's like, see, let's see how far we can push that with these goddamn people.  And, uh, apparently they didn't have no problem with it.  They're in their office jerking off listening.  Who the fuck knows?  I don't know.  But we started doing some crazy stuff with, with guys. 
[00:14:30]  But if we wanted to do the most, you know, the tamest thing with a woman, they're like,  no way.  We just want to have, we never got that.  Yeah.  I never understood that one.  Women come in and get completely naked and they're like, they freak out yet.  Like someone said, an Asian man could spit on a retard's dick.  Oh yeah.  So that was the highlight of yesterday.  It certainly was.  And I, I hear, uh, the countdown show that we do every weekend on 202 is, is starting to 
[00:15:00]  get some legs.  Some legs.  People are listening.  People are trying to figure out what's the number one bit of the week and all that.  And I, I, certainly the Bobo thing is going to be right up there.  That's, that's, well, I was going to say that's huge, but that's really not.  I'm sure the Bobo thing will be replayed for everybody.  All that goodness will be played.  Oh, you'll catch it.  Right, Sam?  Oh yeah.  This is, uh, going to be one of my favorite countdown shows.  Oh, I bet.  Because not only do we have the whole Bobo thing, but the entire Steve debacle will be 
[00:15:30]  featured prominently on the worst of the week countdown.  It's a show featuring two dicks.  Wow.  Steve, uh, Steve's day off.  Yeah.  Before you continue.  I love it.  Yeah.  I got to hear this again.  Yeah.  Because so Bobo's going to be part of the countdown this week.  Steve, uh, discussing that he decided to take every Monday off.  Yeah.  Well, that's what we thought.  With a foreseeable future.  And it, but that's only five days.  Yeah.  I'm still confused by his explanation.  Forever and ever and ever.  Forever.  Forever. 
[00:16:00]  Three days.  Well, I think Derek put this one together.  Yes.  Who said life was all about following the rules?  Carleese.  Carleese.  I'm a man of leisure.  This summer.  Greg Hughes, it's Mr. Carleese.  You're an asshole.  Find out what happens when one executive producer discovers he has 50 sick days and decides  to use them all.  Ah, the Prius.  If you have the means, I highly recommend you pick one up. 
[00:16:30]  Starring Steve Carleese.  I want to eat in that restaurant.  I'm going to make a fake reservation with my new stomach.  And Steve Carleese as Steve Carleese.  Don't you know me?  I'm Abe Froman, the internet king of Jersey.  Look at the Foundry logos on everything.  We're shaking a baby now.  Twist and shout coming every Monday.  A family member has days off and you give them crap? 
[00:17:00]  You're an asshole.  Steve Carleese's day off.  Life goes by pretty fast.  If you don't take vacation time, you'll miss out on it.  That's really good.  I like them just taking random shit and clips from the show and throwing them together like that.  What else did we do this week that's going to be part of the countdown, Sam?  Well, I mean, people forget Ace Frehley stopping by was a huge...  Oh, yes.  That was this week.  That was this week, too.  That was Monday.  I thought that was just, to be honest, I thought that was just going to be a little present for Jimmy coming in. 
[00:17:30]  It's going to be funny.  Watch Jimmy kiss Ace's ass and talk about a dress, some dress, maybe a dress for a dress.  Right.  But it turned out Ace was really cool.  He was funny.  He was just kind of hanging.  Yeah.  He was very New York, Ace.  Yeah.  He was very New York.  And the surprise on Jimmy's face, the video that we posted was really good.  But, all right.  So, yeah, Ace turned out to be a great guest, like Ian was saying.  I thought it was going to be a bunch of kiss shit.  And instead, it was like...  He doesn't give a crap.  He pretty much doesn't give a crap about Gene Simmons. 
[00:18:00]  Like Gene, when Gene comes in.  I was reading between the lines there.  Oh, come on.  Not very hard to read between those lines.  You're right.  No.  And the fun of the countdown is, with all this stuff, this was an amazing week of radio for the Opie and Anthony show.  Who knows what will be number one?  Ooh.  You know?  It could be one of the things we've talked about.  Could be something else.  Maybe it'll be something that happens today.  Today is not off limits.  Today is this week.  I don't know what number one is.  What?  It's Sam talks about going to the furry convention. 
[00:18:30]  That was last week.  Because that was Friday.  That's a week ago already?  That was one week ago today.  Get the fuck out of here.  That will not be on the worst of the week.  I would have bet money.  So did I.  Yeah, I think you'd lie.  You lie?  You lie, Peewee.  And Sam, what do you mean by who knows what's going to happen today?  It's obvious we've done enough radio this week.  Yeah.  You've done enough for the average person.  Are you trying to tell us we have to do more radio today?  You don't have to, but the thing is, it's like...  When they put you two guys in front of mics... 
[00:19:00]  This is called coasting day.  But you never know what's going to happen.  And you put your two guys in front of microphones, and you end up with gold every time.  All week is that chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, where the roller coaster goes up.  That's where it has to work.  That's where the mechanism is going chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.  And then once you're over the top and it goes...  Then it's called just gravity.  So you've hit your peak.  Yeah.  Now it's like, just let gravity run the rest of the show.  Unless you want Bobby Lee to blow on your penis.  No, I don't. 
[00:19:30]  All right, then you're with us.  We're coasting today.  Maybe we'll find a nice number seven or eight bit today.  Seven or eight?  Number seven or eight.  It doesn't have to be number one today.  What else is part of the countdown?  Give me one more.  The Manhattan Madam coming in.  Oh, okay.  I don't remember her.  Kristen Davis?  I don't remember her.  When was she in?  We were going to...  She was in this week.  Was she?  But what happened that day?  What was it?  Like right before that.  Yeah, the healthcare debate.  Yeah, so that was fantastic.  That's on the countdown.  We're going to replay a healthcare debate? 
[00:20:00]  My God.  Well, it's a fun debate.  What the fuck's wrong with you, Sam?  We'll cut out all the talk about healthcare and just talk about the times Jimmy said funny things  about AIDS.  Just isolate the AIDS jokes.  Yeah.  Yeah, but Patrice was in here as well, and that author was in here.  Healthcare?  I mean, it was good, but for a countdown show?  E-Rock also insisted that your conversation about dead pets should make the countdown.  Oh, really?  So, I mean, that might be washed out if there's something good today. 
[00:20:30]  We don't know yet.  Oh, well.  But E-Rock and me host this thing, so you could tell it's an exciting show.  Yeah, it's amazing.  When is it on, Sam?  Just all weekend?  All weekend long, except it's not on from 9 p.m. to midnight on Saturday,  because that's when special, special, that's a special delivery.  Thank you, Sam.  We really appreciate you doing the countdown for the Open Anthony show.  Plug that shit.  I want to add something because I don't usually take credit when credit is due me,  but I am taking credit today, because who is the one that sat here in this chair and said 
[00:21:00]  that Wendy Williams will quit her radio show to do her TV show full-time?  I remember when I said that, and you said, you were saying, oh, my God, no, that will  never happen.  What?  What are you talking about?  Who gives a shit about Wendy Williams?  Stupid Wendy Williams.  We didn't even discuss her.  We just make fun of her.  Of course.  No, I was thinking yesterday, though, because I read, of course, I only read Travis's email 
[00:21:30]  on some of the topics that we'll be discussing, and one of which was Wendy Williams, who we  like to call the monster.  The monster, yeah.  The monster with the wigs.  Yeah.  Is apparently leaving her radio show, and I thought to myself, you know something?  Opie brought that up.  He said, I guarantee you, she will be leaving radio to do this show full-time, so if you're  one of her listeners, she will fuck you over, leave the show, and do that full-time.  Well, man, I'm a seer. 
[00:22:00]  You just don't know that yet.  Oh, a see?  I see things.  Oh, a see.  You know how important that is to radio?  I see things.  I'm a seer of all things.  Why would you do...  Honestly, man, if we had the right TV gig, we would be so gone, I can't even tell you.  I'm not even going to front.  Did you take some of the staff with you?  Maybe.  Staff the TV.  Maybe a couple people.  Better take a staff infection with him.  Maybe a couple of people.  Maybe a couple people.  Not you, Sam, but a couple of the people would go with us.  I'm TV friendly.  Can't take anybody of questionable race. 
[00:22:30]  And if we were able to figure out the TV thing, and it would be something that was edgy  and creative.  Yeah.  And something we could really get behind.  And something we could sleep in a little bit for.  Right.  Would we really continue with radio?  Take this mic and just push it away.  Certainly not full time.  Bye.  We wouldn't do full time.  No.  And especially regular radio, it'd be a little different because we're now on the satellite  thing.  Yeah.  Regular radio, fuck no. 
[00:23:00]  Those guys can't do anything to begin with.  So of course she's going to leave radio to do TV.  After the people meter started for the ratings, they started making her play a lot more music.  Like, oh, they found out that the music was what people were tuning in for.  Yeah.  But the black stations didn't do well with the PPM.  No.  And that there was a lot of racist claims there.  Yeah.  They said that the people meter was racist.  Something like that.  What the hell does that mean?  No, it just meant that the black audience that listens to radio or the black radio stations 
[00:23:30]  are extremely loyal.  So they're writing down shit that they're not even listening to.  So how is that racist?  That's just how it goes.  They claimed racism.  They said that about Howard, by the way, that a lot of people at the end of his run,  Howard does very well.  I'm not going to front.  Okay.  But some people hinted that he probably didn't do as well as the ratings, that it was just  out of habit that people were continuing to write his name down.  It's right for all the hours.  Right.  Like the people meter, I guess, when you pass by a radio, it picks that up. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  And it says, okay, for 15 seconds, you listened to this station because the stations all have  this underlying signal that the people meter you wear throws out.  So it knows, the people meter knows what you're passing by, what you're listening to,  what sound is going into your ear.  It knows it.  So usually if you're a fan of a show, you would just write down, I listen to this show  from, you know, six to 10.  Yeah.  I mean, you never, you take a dump sometimes.  To be fair, our listeners did the same for us as well. 
[00:24:30]  Of course they did.  Because I used Howard as an example, but it's any, it's any show that has a extremely loyal  fan base.  You know, if you get some kind of ratings, I'll just say some kind of ratings, you're certainly  going to like, you know, really, really up the listening of that show.  Of the show you listen, Phil.  If you're a fan of it.  Yep.  And then the people meter, like I said, just picks up all kinds of things.  And, you know, when you're not listening, it picks that up too.  So if you go off to take a dump or a piss, it's, you're not listening. 
[00:25:00]  You got to be an earshot if you're wearing one of those dumps.  So the ratings dropped.  Right.  For a lot of these black stations, especially because they are really loyal to the black  stations.  Because why, you know, why keep things diverse and tell them you listen to Whitey when you  just can put down black shows.  Right.  Things like that.  Of course.  But they found out that the truth was they weren't listening as much as they said they  were.  So then all of a sudden it was the company's fault.  It was the PPM's fault.  Yeah.  It was the people meter was racist somehow.  The little racist thing on your head. 
[00:25:30]  So the black owners got together and said it's racist and you guys got to figure out how to,  you know, figure this out so we get better ratings.  Ridiculous.  All right, Sam.  Thank you.  So the countdown starts sometime.  Starts early in the morning on.  Wake up on Saturday, flip on the radio, and I'll bet me and E-Rock will be exploring  some of our favorite bits from the week with you.  Two ones are on.  Maybe after that.  And you don't let E-Rock talk too much, do you?  Oh, no.  All right, good.  I've listened to you guys a couple of times and it's right at the point where I'm like, 
[00:26:00]  shut up and play the goddamn bit.  You don't like their banter?  I hate their banter.  Whose banter do you hate more?  I care.  Theirs?  Whosoever is on at that moment is the worst banter.  It just gets worse.  Whose banter is worse though?  Sam and E-Rock's or the local news team?  The local Channel 5 news in New York?  Yeah.  Um, wow, I gotta say Sam and E-Rock's banter is worse. 
[00:26:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Because at least I can look at the blonde for a few seconds.  Than the dumb blonde pregnant bimbo on Channel 5 here in New York?  Yeah.  With her partner there who hates her guts?  Yeah, E-Rock kind of still kind of puts on that radio voice.  Yeah, we've made moves.  It's been changed up a little bit.  The intros are much shorter than they originally were.  We keep them to about 30 seconds because...  And I'm sure that was your guy's idea, right?  Oh no, it was management.  No. 
[00:27:00]  Management actually had one good idea.  Could you chalk up one?  Put one on the...  We have a big poster in here that says,  Management ideas, good and pieces of shit.  Pieces of shit we have extended the page down with stapled papers.  And good we don't have a mark on.  Could you put one on the good column?  And then we will just put this day as when we were able to put...  Take a picture so we can remember when we put the one.  With the blue paint.  Telling you guys to keep the breaks short. 
[00:27:30]  Good idea.  But what's up with E-Rock with the fake radio voice?  The one thing...  Hold on.  Let me jump in here.  He's been with us five years.  Most of you guys have been here since we came back to radio, right?  Steve's been...  Is the only one that's been here longer than the five years.  Because you would think you guys, and you have except for E-Rock,  would learn the one basic thing that Ant and I teach everybody.  Just talk.  E-Rock does a fake...  I learned that from wheeze years ago.  It's like, don't use the fake radio voice.  He does the fake radio voice and his timing is terrible too. 
[00:28:00]  Danny probably picked up on this too when we did the Tippy Tom show.  Alright, now we need some fucking examples.  So now someone's got to work and get some of these cut-ins.  You can get the cut-ins from some old shows.  I don't care.  Because when you throw it, like, I would like...  Maybe it was in my head, I don't know.  But I'd throw it to him with the intention of,  here comes the wind down into the bit.  Yeah, yeah.  But then he brings up, he's like, yeah, remember earlier when you...  And I was like, no, don't you understand?  I'm doing that so you could just intro the clip and we're done. 
[00:28:30]  So, yeah, what Sam said.  That's it.  And then I'm like, okay, well then I'll intro what I just set up for you to intro.  Oh, it's the word.  I gotta hear the banter between you and E-Rock.  Because Sam's gonna have his own radio show someday.  I'm convinced of that.  But the problem is, he's like, working out all sorts of different partners.  And it's just a nightmare for the king.  Between Sam and Eastside Dave and E-Rock.  Eastside Dave, there's a good prospect.  He's funny.  He's drunk. 
[00:29:00]  He is sometimes drunk.  There have been issues with recording shows with Dave in the past.  Can we get some old ones?  You got old ones still around?  It's gonna take a second or two.  All right.  But you gotta find some good ones.  So, maybe after the break, you give us some examples of the banter between Sam and E-Rock.  And when he's all like, yeah, well, here's when the guys...  Like, he wants to sound interested.  E-Rock?  Or he wants to sound like profound or something.  I don't know what it is.  He's just like, yeah, well, this...  I remember when the guys did the... 
[00:29:30]  Shut up.  Just shut the fuck up.  He also does a thing where, like, because he listens to the criticisms, and he does  a thing where he's trying to just be sort of, like, out there, like, I just don't care.  Here's just a joke that is way too inside and nobody will get.  Yeah.  But, like, you sit there on it and you're like, there's no way to go with this.  There's no way to go with this.  Just intro the bit in a regular voice.  How did our show, by the way, become the Sam and E-Rock show?  I want to know.  Because I listened one fucking weekend, I'm like, wow, I think we were replaced by Sam 
[00:30:00]  and E-Rock on our own channel.  They're trying to do, like, wacky things.  They're doing wacky bits.  So they're talking for five minutes.  Like you said, where's the bit?  Where's the bit?  It's a clip show.  That's been brought down.  Five-minute intros.  Hence the one on the good idea column of management.  Yeah, I mean, you guys get a lot of freedom to talk a lot on our show.  Yes, the five-minute intros are brought down to about 30 seconds.  You've got to find bit that we're running into the ground, and you're on the air a lot. 
[00:30:30]  Danny's on the air a lot.  But the countdown show's got to be quick and to the point.  Right.  You know, the goodness of the bits of the week.  No complaints.  Now all I want to do is hear E-Rock's banter.  I've got to hear this after the break.  I hope Travis finds something.  What, what, what?  I'm just watching Jill going over the Sonos system.  She knows how it works.  She used that in the bathroom all the time.  I swear.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what you got, obviously?  Guaranteed she's looking at that, remembering the bathroom.  Wow, she's looking pretty good. 
[00:31:00]  The time she went to the bathroom.  Yeah, yeah.  She looks good with the clothes on, right?  Yeah, with the clothes on, with the dark hair.  The hair color's good, too.  Yeah, that fake blonde stuff wasn't working out.  Are you eyeing any of these other traffic girls?  The traffic girl from Channel 5.  Isn't bad, right?  Not too bad.  I think she's out of range, though.  She's a little chubby.  I don't know.  Is this on stretch?  Is that screen on stretch, or is it a...  Yeah, she's a big girl.  Speaking of boobies.  Yeah?  You don't watch Big Brother, obviously. 
[00:31:30]  No.  Do you watch Big Brother?  No.  You're a reality guy.  Yeah, but I never got it.  You know why?  Because E-Rock's the Big Brother guy.  They kicked off the tit monsters.  The house filled with gay guys or something?  Oh, man.  Did you see the girl that was on Big Brother?  No, but I'm going to be in a second.  I guarantee CBS is pissed off, because this girl is a bikini model.  She's got massive breast implants.  Massive.  And all she does is walk around the house in bikinis, and they kicked her off.  The show's only been on three weeks.  It's going to be on the rest of the summer. 
[00:32:00]  Why would you do that?  I don't know anything about the show.  My girl watches, and I was watching last night with her, and I'm like, all right, I'll take a look.  And I'm like, why would they kick her off?  E-Rock's a huge fan.  E-Rock wants to be on Big Brother so bad.  Really?  He's got the big part down.  Really?  You know what?  She's probably going to be brought back now every week as like, well, we've got a special guest to help you with this one.  And they bring the big tit monster back the next week.  Same thing.  We have a special guest.  Guess who it is? 
[00:32:30]  This show is nonsense.  It's another dumb reality show that means nothing.  Nonsense.  So at least get the girls that look good to stay as long as possible.  Yeah.  So the two girls that were up for elimination yesterday was a really hot blonde and this, what we like to say, this tit monster.  Right.  So they're going to lose one out of the two hot girls on the show.  Oh.  What happened?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, she's.  That's her right there?  No, she's safe. 
[00:33:00]  Oh.  That's not the one?  No.  Oh, okay.  She's the blonde.  I think her name's Jordan.  Yeah.  All right.  She's not bad.  She's way better than not bad, Ant.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  Trying to figure out if she's got the implants or if those are natural heavy boobs.  Well, we look for that clip.  I got to say that Danny sent me a link yesterday, which started me on a four-hour marathon of looking at porn.  I couldn't stop.  What was the clip, though? 
[00:33:30]  It was a clip that apparently he was looking for yesterday where it was supposed to be some 18-year-old girl coming to clean some guy's pool.  It's like the over-the-top, you know, like, oh, hey, mister.  Mister?  Mister?  She was more retarded than young.  Yeah.  Like, she was supposed to come off as, like, this young girl.  She came off as a retarded girl.  Nice.  Is this good?  Am I doing this right?  And it's funny.  It's like, do you know what oral sex is?  Yeah.  And she's like, no. 
[00:34:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  And then he goes, yeah, now put this in your mouth.  And she goes, like this?  And he goes, yeah, like that.  And then she proceeds to get a porn star blowjob.  First time out of the box.  Melody, that was it.  Melody by the pool.  Yeah, yeah, look.  She's like, and she's acting retarded.  Dude, she looks.  And then there's Vin Diesel, I guess, getting some head.  Is this legal?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is, you know.  No, she's a porn star. 
[00:34:30]  Girl looks young.  But then again, you just pull the hair back and put it in ponytails and then make it.  See, you can tell there she's not.  She's over 18.  But it's like, so I watched this video.  And I laugh because it's kind of funny how retarded she is and how she's just taking a giant mule cock up her ass.  And, you know, it's her first time ever.  It's ridiculous.  And then I'm just clicking links.  And I realized four hours went by.  And I'm just like, I've been looking at porn for four fucking hours. 
[00:35:00]  Jesus.  And I just ended up on a site that was completely different than the one Danny sent the link from.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, we've discussed it.  You don't know.  Yeah, look at her.  First time.  First time.  That's the first time she's riding a fucking guy in a way that defies gravity.  Right.  Jesus.  Her pussy shaved.  Why?  You know what?  Fuck.  We might end up just watching porn for the next.  Just watching porn.  That's what I did.  Now I understand it. 
[00:35:30]  I totally understand.  I'm just like, all right.  Oops.  These are moves that, like, a veteran made.  Looks like my brother Joe fucking.  Wait a minute.  Wow.  It does look like Joe.  That's hysterical.  That angle looks like Joe.  Go, Joe.  She fucks like that.  And then at the end, you know, when it's time for him to finish up, she's like, oh, what's that?  What's that?  Get this cup all over her face.  And she's like, what is it?  It's gooey.  Shut up.  It's like, stop.  You're a mess.  All right. 
[00:36:00]  The bobshot.  Back of balls.  Good old bobshot.  So the big brother chick.  Just to show Ant.  Tube 8 rules, by the way.  Tube 8 rules.  Yeah, yeah.  What was the last clip?  Do you remember?  Free porn.  No, by that point, I was just still picturing it.  I was just still picturing, boom, boom, going through.  I was looking for, you know what I really like? 
[00:36:30]  Girls.  I really like full nude, laying on the bed, kind of toying a little with themselves, but looking at the camera.  Like, so they're looking at you kind of nastily.  Oh, really?  So if you're jacking to it, it looks like they're watching you jacking.  No, because then if they're looking at the camera, then I know they're aware of their surroundings.  Yeah, but it's good, because you can kind of see that look.  I like the illusion that they just happen to be doing this, and maybe there was somebody caught it.  No, no. 
[00:37:00]  Some of the voyeur stuff is good like that.  But I need them, like, looking at the camera.  And it's better if there's, like, three chicks that are just fucking around with each other, and kind of one of them's looking at the camera.  Because then it's like, all right, she's looking, going, oh, man, look at him jerking his cock.  See, wow.  I'm totally, wow.  If they look at the camera, then I'm like, oh, they're, see, they're moaning a little too, they're moaning, you know, loud for the camera.  Yeah.  They're trying a little harder for the camera. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  I like to think they're doing it because they just need to or want to do it.  You know what I mean?  I know exactly what you mean.  That's why, though, it's a fine line between that, what you're talking about, and just looking like an amateur kind of thing looking at you.  Yeah, this is that point.  No, no, no, I just got scared because, you know, it looked like the conference table from WAAF.  For real.  Dude.  Right.  See, and then she looks kind of, she's kind of looking back.  That's nice. 
[00:38:00]  I would use that.  I think you like this video because of her ass, not because she's looking at the camera.  Well, yeah, no, it's the whole package, believe me, the whole, the, God damn, the package.  Sam, nice, right?  Yeah.  That's nice right there.  Hanging out with the guys, right, Sam?  Yeah, watching chicks in porn.  What's up, AJ?  Who's got, hey.  That's a character, AJ.  Sam, why'd you come back in?  Nice legs and everything.  Because Travis has an E-Rock intro.  Could you, um, could you email me this link too, Danny, and I could spend another four hours looking at pornography? 
[00:38:30]  It's, I wonder, and they say how unhealthy it is to just look at porno.  Yeah, whatever.  When you spend hours like that looking at it, how am I affected?  Yeah.  I just, like, it made me feel good.  I'm like, I'm just looking at, I'm looking at something that is so nice to look at.  Your blood pressure goes way up a little bit, but after that, you're calm and you got back down and you go right to sleep.  Yes, wonderful.  Put you right to sleep.  I didn't know how exhausting it was to come. 
[00:39:00]  And if it doesn't feel like four hours, is it really four hours?  I mean, when you play a video game or look at porn for hours and hours and hours on end.  It's not like you're working on a spreadsheet.  Exactly.  Yeah, it goes very quickly.  It's not like you're redoing your bathroom or something stupid in that time zone.  Yeah, it's like eight o'clock at night and then it's like, hey, it's midnight.  What happened?  Damn.  I must have looked at 10,000 photos and videos.  That's amazing.  You got some stamina, my friend.  It's great. 
[00:39:30]  I love looking at nudity.  Huh?  I was just reminded.  I saw this picture in my internet browsing a few months ago, I guess.  It's somebody took a screen cap of their internet history.  I guess they have a roommate.  It's like a college roommate.  So he saw what his roommate was doing on his computer all day long.  Porno watching starts at 6.52 a.m.  And then porno watching stops at 2.27 p.m.  Roommate finishes marathon beat-off session. 
[00:40:00]  Checks Gmail.  That's like, what, eight hours?  Wow.  Holy shit.  But you can do that.  It just keeps, you know, you keep finding another site, another link pops up, and you're like,  oh, what's this treat?  Ted in Providence wants in on this.  Ted.  Gentlemen, what's going on?  Hello, Ted.  So, Anthony, I've got to completely agree with you about the eye contact thing.  Thank you, sir.  I was watching this one video on, like, PornoTube or RedTube or one of those things where this 
[00:40:30]  girl was getting fucked but looking at the camera and saying, yeah, jerk it, you fucking  pervert.  And it was a great thing I had ever seen in my life.  I loved it.  You know what?  You can turn me around.  That sounds all right right there.  I don't like when a girl's getting fucked, though, and looking like that.  Like, if she's naked on the bed, then it's like the prelude to we're going to be having  sex.  Sure.  It's kind of the prelude to that.  Yeah, keep the pesky dude out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  I just like those or like a good two or three chicks scene on the bed where they're paying 
[00:41:00]  attention to the camera a little.  Well, even a good still photo of that is good because you kind of, you know, you got  to use your mind a little.  You know what?  You know what takes me completely out of the game is when a girl is flashing in these videos  or like a girl's gone wild is a perfect example.  But you see it all over the Internet.  And they you know, they have a really nice set upper right and they're going to show you  right at it.  Yeah.  And they go like this.  They lift up their shirts and then make that weird face like, yeah, don't make fucking 
[00:41:30]  dopey faces.  It completely takes me out of the game.  They stick their tongue out and wave their head around.  What a perfect set of tits.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, it's our first time getting naked in the bathroom.  Look, she's.  Yeah, this is the first time really.  She's never done this before on camera.  God, what a great.  See, this is what happened last night.  Yeah.  This is exactly what happened.  We're going to move on to another subject.  And all of a sudden we're still looking at porno again.  That tube aid is dangerous. 
[00:42:00]  And she's just washing.  Oopsie.  I dropped the soap.  She just said.  Looks like some Ukrainian chick.  What is with the Ukrainian Russian girls in porno now?  I like these.  They're all paying off that debt.  Yeah.  Paying off that shipping debt.  They got some bills to pay.  Shipping is expensive for those.  Those broads.  All right.  So the big brother chick.  Yeah.  Back to her.  Yeah.  Because we can be on this all day.  A little shampoo on her tits.  That's great.  Those are really nice, by the way. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  So the big brother.  But that's how it happened.  I understand.  So this is the girl.  Wow.  Exactly.  All right.  I mean, her teeth are a bit on the big side.  She's a little.  She looks like she could be related to Rich Voss.  A little secretariat head.  In the mouth area.  I mean, that's the most clothes she wore is the clip that Dan found.  Are those big fake titties?  They have to be.  Ticks. 
[00:43:00]  They have to be.  But she walked around.  I've gotten completely into natural tits now.  Like, I don't even want to look.  The second I click on a link and see fake tits, I'm off.  Off of that link.  Big.  You know why?  It's like a diamond in the rough.  You find a nice, heavy, good set of real tits.  And you're like, oh, that's special.  Yeah.  Not man-made.  It's not a cubic zirconia.  Well, because they're.  I don't know what they're doing with the implants.  I just don't. 
[00:43:30]  They're just.  They look rock hard.  They don't move.  They look hard.  They're overstretched.  They're perfectly round globes with this fucking goddamn Colorado river running through the middle of them.  I don't need that.  People are whitewater rafting.  Yeah, they're whitewater rafting from a neck to a belly button through this cavern that is supposed to be a cleavage.  Yeah.  Whatever.  So on Big Brother, they kicked off the hot chicken.  I would imagine CBS is like, we couldn't control this better?  Yeah.  Get rid of one of the ugly broads? 
[00:44:00]  Well, at least they still got that blonde, I guess.  That's what they're probably figuring.  Yeah, absolutely.  Man, they got the blonde.  Whatever.  I don't watch that show or many other reality shows except for the goddamn, I can't stop watching the detective ones.  Forensic ones.  You see, it's not forensic files, but it's something about forensics.  Something with forensics.  You were wearing forensics.  It was forensics at the mall.  And they do this whole thing where they scan the area, computer scan it.  And they have like this animation of the crime that happened with like these bullet time shots of where the bullet actually went through the guy. 
[00:44:30]  And it really happened.  Like it's a real case that they're working on and shit.  And my favorite is, I didn't do nothing.  Because it's said in every episode.  It's like the catchphrase.  It's like Dynamite was in Good Times.  It's I didn't do nothing on first 48.  You've got to have a nice catchphrase if you can have a hit TV show.  Why you want to do me like this is another one.  Why you want to do me like this?  And the officer goes, there's blood on your hands and now on the back of your shirt.  He goes, blood? 
[00:45:00]  It's like, no, that's not an excuse.  Well, you asked it as a question.  Let him go.  Yeah, what do you think it is?  And I sit there also and go like, how stupid are these guys?  The smart ones, they go, well, you know, I'm going to have to talk to a lawyer.  And then the cops go, all right.  They pick up their stuff and they have to leave the room immediately.  And then they shake their head like, God, I almost had them.  So now watching that, wouldn't you know that if the cops are pissed that you said, I want  a lawyer and they pick their shit up, leave the room and then the camera's on them and 
[00:45:30]  they're going, God damn it, that that's what you want to do if you're a bad guy.  Yeah, of course.  But they sit there and go.  Well, it was self-defense.  And the cop goes, I got him, I got him.  And they use the same trick on all of them.  They're like, you know, why don't you just let us know what happened.  It's going to help you out in the long run.  You know, when you lie to us like this, it hurts you.  You know, you don't want to lie to us and get into more trouble than you're in already 
[00:46:00]  because we know what's going on.  And then they're like, OK, well, I walked in with five of my friends and she screamed.  So as self-defense, we cut our head off.  And, you know, and it's like, shut up, get a lawyer, dummy.  Lawyer up.  The cops are all looking in the TV monitor, the ones that aren't in the interrogation room  drooling.  Like, look at this asshole.  He's actually fessing to it.  That's awesome.  Great show, though.  God, I love First 48.  I'm going to have to take a peek at that.  Oh, it's fantastic. 
[00:46:30]  Millionaire matchmaker?  No, I don't watch that.  Sam, you're out of this conversation.  Sam, watch a man's show.  Really?  It's on Bravo.  What about logo?  What did you say?  It's on logo.  Bravo.  Your favorite channel.  Let's go to Aaron in Alabama.  Aaron.  Alabama more.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up, sir?  Hey, I was actually going to say about the board thing a couple minutes ago.  So there's a site called poosyplicks.com, and there was, like, a video a little while 
[00:47:00]  ago, and this girl, while she's given, like, the blowjob, she'll stop, and she'll look  at the camera and spit on the lens and then kind of slurp it back up.  Oh, God damn.  That's pretty sick.  That's what gets you going there, Aaron.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's pretty hot.  Right on.  And then Gangland is another one that's just fantastic.  Are you talking about Crime 360? 
[00:47:30]  Yes, Crime 360.  John in Arizona got that.  That was the show.  Thank you, John.  Thank you, John.  Okay.  And Gangland is another great one, too, where they show, they do a little documentary on  a bunch of gangs.  I watched, what I watched yesterday, I watched Hell's Angels, which was really good, and then  they show, like, video clips of them doing, like, horrific things.  And then they had the Bloods, which was good.  It's like, wow, this is, like, top-of-the-line gang stuff. 
[00:48:00]  They got A-listers.  Yeah, they got the A-listers.  It's an all-star team.  The Bloods.  And I did not know this.  Do you know the Bloods are outnumbered by the Crips?  Like, there are something like 6,000 Bloods and 18,000 Crips in Los Angeles.  Wow.  And, yeah, they say for some reason they get, they're able to survive through just really  sticking together and being loyal to each other and not really screwing up.  It's like the Clippers versus the Lakers.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot more Laker fans. 
[00:48:30]  A lot more Laker fans.  Than Clipper fans.  Occasionally the Clippers, you know.  But it's cool to be a Clipper fan.  Why is this guy talking about Marty in Cleveland?  Marty.  Hey, good morning.  Hey, you hear LeBron James smoked pot in high school?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Is the sports world going to be able to survive?  That's crazy.  I was already on welfare when he was a kid.  Hold on, hold on.  We're using you to get some Cleveland info out there.  So LeBron James has a book out, and they're going to say that he smoked pot as a 17-year-old 
[00:49:00]  in high school.  Wow.  I've got to pick that book up.  But it was the big sports headline yesterday.  And they also finally found a tape of, what was his name?  The kid who dunked on LeBron.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I saw that.  Huh?  Jordan Crawford.  Jordan Crawford dunked on LeBron James at, what, a basketball camp.  And they tried to, pretty much like the Kennedy assassination, they tried to burn every copy  of this tape, and finally one has come out of this kid just completely dunking on LeBron James. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, my God, look at him, right over the top there.  So that kid is like a star now.  He is everywhere.  You can find it on YouTube, TMZ.  It's everywhere.  Yeah, TMZ has like the bad quality version.  There's actually a real high quality version on EBAM's World, which is linked on, if you  go to What Would Tyler Durden Do?  Oh, okay.  It's on like the second page.  Our boy has it.  That's cool.  So what's the back story on this game?  Just a dumb pickup game at camp? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, it was just one of the, it was at LeBron's own basketball skills camp.  Oh, damn.  The story isn't so much that he got dunked on.  I don't really think that that's like such a huge deal, but the fact that...  No, that is a huge deal.  NBA players don't want to be dunked on by high school kids, ever.  True, but...  Ever.  I'm serious.  That is a huge part of the story.  It's not like one of these unbelievable things like where it could never happen.  No, to them, they don't want it to ever happen.  I don't know, but...  Because it's called what?  Being post... 
[00:50:30]  What was the old term?  They don't want other NBA players dunking on him and making him look silly.  Yeah.  But it was a Nike-sponsored camp, and so I guess they didn't want that tape getting around,  so they tried to confiscate like all.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's a bigger story than...  Oh, yeah, of course.  They just didn't...  Like Lucas with Star Wars Christmas.  Exactly.  All right, Marty, why are you calling?  I'm sorry.  Hey, I was listening to XM yesterday, and I...  Classic Rewind, Meg Griffin, who...  I think she's as stupid as the Meg Griffin on the frickin' Family Guy show. 
[00:51:00]  She said something about food stamps, which she was trying to be really nice, how you  could use them at farmer's markets and crap like that now, but I just thought it was kind  of retarded, because if you're listening to, like, satellite radio, why are you on food  stamps, you know?  It was just kind of dumb, but that's just my thing.  Sorry.  It's hard to get out there.  At least we got an apology out of you.  At least we used them for the LeBron James.  Yeah, see? 
[00:51:30]  See?  That's why...  And that's why Obi said, hold on, hold on.  We just want to get some Cleveland news out of you.  Just to guarantee that your phone call's average.  You knew even if you tanked, at least we'd get something out of you.  Yeah, because we've got to set you into these stories, so, you know, we've got to get  there somehow.  Thanks, Marty.  Bye.  No worries, brother.  I've seen the movie poster for The Ugly Truth.  What is The Ugly Truth?  And it is one of these typical...  I don't know what it is.  Okay.  But if you look at the poster, it is exactly the same thing I said. 
[00:52:00]  Now, I've been looking at these for years now.  The guy-girl looking, and the guy's looking like...  And the girl's like...  No, no, no.  I hate those.  Yeah, but if you watch the trailer, you can tell they're doing something new with it.  Oh, are they?  Yeah, what are they doing now?  All right.  I'm sure that something...  But you've got to describe the poster, because Gerard Butler's in it.  Yeah.  He's leaning.  But see what he's doing? 
[00:52:30]  The symbol of love.  They both have hearts in their hands.  And the broad, what's her name?  Katherine Heigl.  Oh, Heigl.  Heigl.  She's holding it up by her head, by her face.  Yeah, like...  The heart.  Yeah.  And she's leaning on a wall.  This kind of black wall that's separating the two of them.  Right.  She's leaning on it with a little smug smile on her face, going like, oh, love.  You know, looking at the heart.  And Gerard Butler is leaning against it, and he's got a thumb tucked in his belt loop, and  he's holding the heart over his cock. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Over his cock.  Because he's in love, too.  And he's looking out like, hey, I'm going to get a little of this action.  See, it's the difference between guys and girls.  And how we think differently.  But that whole guy, girl on the cover with the stark white background, it just means  horrible chick flick.  Every single time.  Well, duh.  I know, but it's...  When I see it now, I just can't help but look and just be disgusted. 
[00:53:30]  But Hollywood knows that people will just eat that shit up.  All the chicks look at it and go, oh, it looks like it's another romantic comedy.  A romantic comedy.  Do you want to know what the premise is?  What's the premise?  Did you have to go already?  Gerard is a pull no punches, you know, guy's guy.  No, he isn't.  Really?  I couldn't tell from the movie.  And he doesn't mind telling Katherine Heigl what it is.  And Katherine Heigl, on the other hand, thinks that guys like a woman who tastes wine and 
[00:54:00]  things like that.  A classy woman with a good mind.  And they hate each other.  But he helps her be more attractive to men.  And guess who becomes attracted to each other?  Don't tell me.  Wait, in the end?  In the end, I bet they hook up after the whole movie of not liking each other.  But there's some sexual tension there.  There is.  There's something brewing.  But there's always one scene that lets you know that, wait a minute. 
[00:54:30]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  It might be a look from her or a look from him.  And they get, they're like, because they're having a moment where they understand each other.  Right.  And then they'll almost get close and then someone will say something stupid and they're arguing again.  Oh, this will never work out.  I can't stand it.  Or they're distracted.  So now we got to wait another 20 minutes to this horse shit to find what happens.  The pretty woman poster.  See, I can't take these.  Yeah, it's very similar.  We should get a whole montage of these posters.  Don't get along at the beginning. 
[00:55:00]  But at the end, they realize they are made for each other.  Can't one of these end just tragically?  It should.  Just when they're going to get back together, there's a horrific car accident or something.  It should.  He should end up being like a serial killer.  And he takes her back and chops her up in his bathtub.  Did you see the trailer for the time traveler wife or something?  The time traveler's wife.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah, yeah.  No reservations. 
[00:55:30]  There's another one with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart.  Well, he's the dude from Batman, right?  Yeah, Aaron Eckhart.  Yes.  Same thing, though.  Only there's not the stark white background.  But still, back to back.  Kind of, hey, you.  Hey, you.  We know how this is going to end.  We're going to be fucking.  But I hate you now.  Oh, I hate those.  Yeah, the time traveler's wife.  That looks horrendous.  Apparently, this guy travels through time, and he's got no control over it. 
[00:56:00]  Like, he'll just disappear.  But he still has time to fall in love.  Well, he falls in love with this girl.  He knew her when she was a kid.  Right.  And then he travels through time.  Yeah.  And she's all icky and older now.  No, I'm kidding.  What do you mean?  She's 25?  Exactly.  That's what I meant.  No, she.  And for some reason, they kind of fall in love.  Oh, failure to launch.  Failure to launch with Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker.  He's got his hands in his pocket, and he's on his heels, leaning backwards as she's pushing him. 
[00:56:30]  Forward.  Where?  Forward.  Does that mean he can't cum?  Failure to launch.  Is that what the whole movie's about?  The story of Bobo.  She tries to get him to cum, but he fucking is completely limp.  Because she's got a horsey face.  It looks like she's.  Who watches these?  I can't take it.  It's the ultimate one.  There's a whole market out there. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, my God.  Is that in another language?  Failure to launch?  He's.  She's, like, now got a hand truck.  He's in a chair, and she's hand trucking him away.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Awful.  Awful.  Just from the cover, you can tell a movie by its cover.  You know damn well.  Look.  Which one is this, Dan?  Dude, is Hollywood just fucking ridiculous that they put the same fucking cover together  for these movies?  And they're mostly back-to-back.  There is four Christmases with Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, back-to-back, stark white 
[00:57:30]  background.  They're wrapped in Christmas ribbon, and he's got his arms folded like, hey, hey.  And she's got her hands on her head like, hey, hey, hey, we're going to fuck at the  end.  But I'm going to hate you now.  But they're wrapped in a ribbon, Ant.  His father, her mother, his mother, her father, all in one day.  Oh, that's crazy.  Four Christmases.  That's crazy.  Starring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon.  Oh, as you've never seen them before. 
[00:58:00]  Hopefully dead.  Ugh.  We all have to go through the Christmas shit.  It doesn't mean you make a movie about it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You know how quickly Christmas goes by?  Deal with it.  It's two fucking days usually.  Two lousy days.  God damn crap.  You just keep finding them.  Ghost of Girlfriend's Pass.  Once again, back-to-back.  Matthew McGonagher and Jennifer Garner.  The stars of the movie are in the poster, obviously.  But the key here is they're back-to-back.  You've got to have them back-to-back.  Every single poster we've seen so far. 
[00:58:30]  And looking in a way like he's like, look, he's smiling.  And the hands are always kind of up on the guy.  Either the arms are crossed or up.  The body language says it all.  The guy is smug.  And like, I don't, you know, hey, I got a bunch of chicks.  I'm the womanizer.  And then Jennifer Garner's holding his scarf now.  She's got some kind of handle on him.  Like, the girl always has some kind of restraint.  She's got to get him on a leash.  Right, on some kind of leash.  And she's making the face like, you're not that tough. 
[00:59:00]  I'll fucking tame you by the end of this movie.  He's basically saying, I get a lot of pussy.  Right.  And she's saying...  This is the last pussy you're going to get or want.  Yeah, and she's saying, like, he's mine, ladies.  Yeah.  Back off, ladies.  He's mine.  Whether he knows it or not already, he will by the end of this boar fest of a fucking movie.  You girls stink.  You girls suck with your fucking movies.  Hollywood wouldn't make them if there wasn't a demand.  I can't see how there's a demand for this. 
[00:59:30]  It's horrible.  Every week, one of these comes out.  You know who loves these movies?  Who?  Roland.  Oh!  Roland.  Roland loves them.  God damn.  He goes to these...  Does he...  Just laugh?  He's admitted on our show.  He likes the chick flick.  The proposal, which Danny had to post her up a little while ago.  Was that the one with the guy and the girl back to back?  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, now I remember which movie you're talking about.  Roland saw it in theaters three times.  No way.  All right. 
[01:00:00]  See, look.  Again, the guy, the girl with some kind of leash on it.  It's...  When they present these to the movie company, do they just go with a working formula?  Of course.  Or do they go like, there's a new idea, not knowing that it's been done a thousand times?  No, no, no, no.  Is everything like regular radio?  Yeah, everything.  Is every business like regular radio?  Everything is formula in Hollywood.  So back to the big brother chick.  Oh, right.  The big brother.  Why don't we take our first break? 
[01:00:30]  Horrible.  Oh, okay, good.  I was hoping for an ending to one of these movies that is a little different, and Bud  the Trucker's got one.  Bud.  I think this movie's great.  I think it's Angels or City of Angels or something with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.  Yeah.  They finally hook up, and she's riding her bike.  They're all happy and shit.  She's riding her bike down a hill and gets plowed by a gravel truck. 
[01:01:00]  I never laughed so hard in my life.  There you go.  Well, that doesn't quite have the movie poster that all these other ones have.  Right.  No, but it's got that sick twist, which is kind of cool.  It is cool.  You need the sick twist.  But it's not, it doesn't, I'm looking at the movie poster thing, and it doesn't look like  that kind of movie, like they're trying to present it as that romantic comedy thing.  See, I'm talking about one of those romantic comedy chick flick that ends horrifically and 
[01:01:30]  just fucks the crowd up.  Like, they're just there to laugh and laugh at the guy, the smug guy that finally gets  it in the end and falls in love with the girl, and then have her get hit by a gravel truck.  That would be fantastic.  That's exactly what they do.  It's great.  Cool.  Thank you, Bud.  Did we, Picture Perfect, we did that poster, right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And also, the poster for what, two guys, one girl?  Yeah, that's coming in a lot.  And a guy in the middle.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Two guys, one girl, and a guy in the middle doesn't know the others are cooking up. 
[01:02:00]  A lot of porn things are coming up, Ann.  Oh, well.  Two girls, one cup.  What?  Yeah, that movie poster.  Yeah, that's the poster.  Well, that is a movie I might want to see.  No kidding.  It's all porn.  Here we go again.  Hey, click on that one.  Right back to porn.  Yeah, that led us to some fine porn shots.  Damn it.  I think they were playing cards in our bag.  Tom, what is it?  Two guys and one girl?  Yeah, it's always like, it's kind of the same scenario. 
[01:02:30]  It's like the two guys and the one girl, and the guy on the left, and the girl on the right,  and the guy in the middle.  I was nervous.  Those two are all girls.  Oh, he's not talking about an actual movie.  He's talking about the two guys and the girl in the middle.  Right, right.  Oh, no, there's a movie.  It's Dean Cook's My Best Friend's Girl.  Two guys, a girl, and a pizza.  Yeah, my best friend's girl had some of that going on.  Did it?  Yes, it did.  Bunch it out.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Horrid.  Yes.  And, oh, there it is. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, my best friend's girl.  There it is.  Back to back.  The smiles.  The troubled look on the fucking guy that put his dick in the apple pie.  So you think Ronnie should have been kicked off Big Brother and not the girl with the big  boobs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh!  Wow, that's weird.  That shouldn't have happened.  Watching your horrible, horrible reality shows. 
[01:03:30]  That was supposed to be crickets.  All right, why don't we take our first break, Ant?  All righty.  We got Bobby Lee coming in today.  We're going to get into some serious shit for a little while after the break because  Obama...  Serious shit?  I don't know what Obama's thinking, but...  Well, that's just it.  He's getting involved with this Cambridge police thing.  We'll give you all the details on that, the latest on that.  Also, rabbis, mayors, organ donors.  I don't get the story.  Jersey's a mess. 
[01:04:00]  I don't even want to try to figure it out.  All I know is a bunch of mayors and a bunch of rabbis were...  Two mayors and some rabbis get in trouble in New Jersey in this summer's biggest hit.  They were arrested at a diner and there's organ donning and I don't know.  Yeah.  And I tried to read up on this one because, you know, we got to be...  We got to at least look smart for you guys and I don't get it.  It seems like it's tiring to try to figure out.  It just looks tiring.  What the fuck?  Maybe someone out there could explain it in... 
[01:04:30]  Could you explain it in...  I can explain that scandal in one paragraph.  Well, everyone is...  Most people are into the whole Twitter thing.  Can you explain it in 140 characters?  Characters.  Rabbis, mayors, organ donors.  And no ampersands.  Don't use an ampersand.  No, it's got to be the Queen's English or whatever. 
[01:05:00]  Is there a Back to the Future 3?  Did they try to put any romantic angle in that cover of that?  What do you mean?  Because I know...  I think, from what I remember...  By the way, I fell asleep to that last thing.  I mean, they all...  Each Back to the Future always has the DeLorean and then one's behind the other, behind the other.  So I think behind Doc is actually the chick.  Oh, stupid.  What's her face there?  Let's see if I'm right.  Steenburgen?  Yeah, Mary Steenburgen.  I fell asleep when she went running after the train in her stupid purple dress. 
[01:05:30]  I can't stand it.  And the great clip of them going off on the hoverboard together.  Looking so fake.  Why bother?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, she's behind.  Why bother?  That right there, that movie poster tells me this movie stunk.  Yeah.  Oh, we got more Bobo clips?  All right, let's get to the break, Ed.  And then we're going to regroup with Bobo clips, rabbis and mayors, Obama with the Cambridge  police situation.  Yeah.  We had a fucking perfect game last night.  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Holy shit.  Not an easy one either.  No, no.  Catch of the year there at least.  Has to be.  Travis is nodding, yes, because he knows we don't like him talking.  And Tom Watson still has me very depressed.  What's he doing to you now?  I just can't get over the fact that he blew it.  What, he shit his pants?  What the fuck?  Someone explain this.  I spit on Bobo's dick yesterday.  It pretty much wiped out everything that happened before that.  It just wiped it out of my head.  The FU line.  It is Friday. 
[01:06:30]  Thanks for checking us out today.  Opie and Anthony.  Before the break, I said, explain the rabbi, mayor, organ donor.  Walking to a bar joke?  Yeah.  Thing that happened in where?  Hoboken yesterday?  Hoboken, yeah.  A bunch of people arrested at a diner.  Rabbis and mayors.  A lot of mayors?  What, are the mayors just getting together like that?  Yeah, I guess they were using a few of them for their political contacts and things to launder money or some crap.  And I asked for you to explain it in 140 characters, in Twitter terms. 
[01:07:00]  And I give credit to Mainline Mike on Twitter.  He writes, they were selling black market organs in Israel, politicians arrested for bribery, rabbis for laundering millions through charities.  The end.  That is pretty much it.  All right, so we don't need to do this.  Over 40 New Jersey politicians?  Oh, yeah.  There were a lot of people involved in this.  And no one's really surprised about it.  Because there's corruption.  Yeah, Jersey is just known as kind of, eh, a little corrupt. 
[01:07:30]  Well, the whole system is corrupt.  A little corrupt.  And what kind of, and then, of course, Corzine, the governor's asking that they step down.  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  It's going out on a limb.  Yeah.  You know, I'm asking that you please leave.  Yeah.  So, we don't have to do this story, do we?  Yeah, it's going to bore the shit out of everybody.  That's all it was.  That's all it was.  There's nothing really interesting about it.  It's just a nice corruption story.  Yeah.  Happens every so often. 
[01:08:00]  How sad is it that we got a nice corruption story or we just put it to the side because it's like, ah, another corruption story.  It's like, who cares?  Is anyone surprised?  By the way, the only detail is the fact that Jersey really needs leadership and a government in there that can kind of get them out of the shitter that they're in with this economy and everything.  And that's what's been happening.  Corrupt leaders.  And you've been getting the shit taxed out of you by Corazine.  Fun Jersey. 
[01:08:30]  Corazine's a nightmare with the taxes, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's another one that's probably going to lose the election because he's taxed the shit out of people.  And he ran on a low or no tax platform years ago.  That's why I just can't vote.  They're all assholes.  And people go, what's the matter with you?  You don't vote.  I'm like, because that system is really fucked up.  It's completely flawed.  They all just lie just to get into office.  And then when they do get in office, this is all the stuff we talk about on a regular basis.  They don't even know what they're – they supposedly represent you, but you don't even know what they're doing for you down in Washington. 
[01:09:00]  They're all picked before we get to pick them.  So we don't actually get to pick who we want or who would be best for the job or anything because you only get a choice of a couple of people.  Vote independent.  Vote this.  Vote a write-in.  Yeah, that always works.  It's called a wasted vote.  You've got to get to the point where people are really going to back an independent or something that is really going to change stuff.  But people, they always talk that they want change, but then they really don't. 
[01:09:30]  Like everybody, oh, Obama's going to bring change.  Is he?  He's going to bring change as far as a color goes.  Everything else?  Boy, if this guy is in business as usual as far as Democrats go.  That's where I completely agree with you with the Obama thing, by the way.  I was a little excited like a lot of people out there, and it's the same guy, just a different color this time around.  I mean, I know we simplify stuff on the show, but that's basically it.  Yep.  Basically it.  Same guy, different color. 
[01:10:00]  And speaking of which, we can move into this Obama-Cambridge thing.  Obama!  But first of all, we've got to do the right thing.  We've got Kenny in Jersey City.  Kenny, I see your phone call, and we've definitely got to talk to you.  What's up?  Kenny.  Good morning, guys.  How are you today?  Pretty good, Kenny.  I'm in the car.  I'm on my way to Jersey City.  I'm a fireman in Jersey City.  We're all going to the funeral this morning of Detective Mark DiNardo.  Yes.  To take a moment for the fans to, you know, if you see an officer in the street today, just take a moment to give him a thanks or, you know, just a condolences because it is, that's a tough job, guys. 
[01:10:30]  It really is.  You're not going to get an argument from us.  Ed was saying just before we went on the air today, he's like, I don't even know how these guys do their jobs as cops or would want to even go into that profession at this point.  Like, who would want to, the way they're just being shit on at every turn, you know, it's like there's thugs out there. 
[01:11:00]  There's just thugs out there that if the cops use any type of force on them, they're brought in front of boards and internal affairs and community leaders and they need apologies.  They got to be fired.  They got to be sometimes imprisoned.  But this guy just going out there and gets shot for doing his job.  It's it's atrocious how people treat the police. 
[01:11:30]  And I don't mean like everybody, you know, and I mean, there are some scumbag cops out there, believe me.  But I just mean like, like how they treat them just on a daily basis.  And these communities where it's like, oh, boy, the cops, they fuck everything up.  They come in here and roust everybody.  And they're the first ones to call up, help, my husband's coming at me with a knife or some shit.  Oh, then you want the cops there.  And then when they show up and start rousting your husband and handcuffing him, usually the wife jumps on their fucking back trying to protect the stupid husband. 
[01:12:00]  Just leave a wall off the area.  Wall it off.  Cuts a Tina wire.  There you go.  Kenny, what?  Anthony, we appreciate this.  So you hope when they autopsied that mutant, they found 19 bullet holes in him.  Fantastic.  Absolutely.  Fantastic.  I would say not enough.  No, not enough. 
[01:12:30]  You know, listen to you guys a long time.  I was down in New Orleans with you.  That's so true.  Stay, enjoy, enjoy the show and take care.  Thanks a lot, Kenny.  By the way, I'm going to the funeral of Mark DiNardo, a good guy we lost.  Mark also donated his organs.  Yeah, donated his organs, which is, you know, just an amazing thing.  And, yeah, just a real hero, that guy that just, you know, you don't hear anything.  You know, how about Obama comments on him? 
[01:13:00]  How about, you know, Reverend Al comments on a brave cop that was doing his job and killed in the line of duty?  These goddamn community leaders just never want to bring up the fact that there's a problem out there.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  Totally right.  Unbelievable.  It's just a sad day.  You guys, I'm going to punch out, and you take care, fellas.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Kenny from Jersey City.  We move to another cop.  Motorhead.  Wackbag. 
[01:13:30]  What's up?  Hey, guys.  You're a cop, Motorhead.  Yeah, I'm a deputy sheriff in Nebraska.  I know.  That sounds like I pretty much watch cornfields in college.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I work in a pretty big city here in Nebraska.  I bet there's gangs.  I bet you have gangs in Nebraska.  We most certainly do.  We have MS-13, Crips, Bloods, Latin Kings.  You've got five minutes I can read off the rest of the list.  That's where it covers the big ones.  Is that like the minor leagues?  They work their way up to L.A. and stuff? 
[01:14:00]  It's fraternities.  I think a lot of times they come here to hide because they've got so many warrants and everything  issued out of them and other places.  They'll come here and hide.  And you move to Nebraska going, you know, I think I'm going to go to Nebraska.  I'll be safe there with my family, and then you're among all these people that are hiding.  I had a story yesterday.  I'm sorry.  I'm just going to step in for a minute here.  I heard a story yesterday that just disgusted me.  This 9-year-old, I think it was, or no, 14-year-old white kid was riding his skateboard, just having  a little fun, riding his bike. 
[01:14:30]  I'm sorry.  I get everything wrong now.  And was beaten to death by some young gentlemen who turned out to be gang members, all black.  The kid was white.  He was riding his bike, just having fun.  Where did this go down?  This was in the suburbs of, I'll have to look the story up.  I heard it last night, though.  But it was in the suburbs.  Was it a bad neighborhood is what I'm looking at.  As a matter of fact, no, it wasn't.  But there was this bad element in the neighborhood. 
[01:15:00]  And then somebody actually said, one of the reporters was like, this isn't really a gang.  It's more people imitating a gang.  It's like, wait a minute.  You look at their MySpace pages and Facebooks, and they're all throwing up gang signs.  They're all wearing the same color bandana.  They're committing crimes, and they've killed someone.  What do you need as a definition for a gang than that?  Why?  Because they're not in an inner city?  They killed some white kid. 
[01:15:30]  Because, you know, no other reason.  There's some riding his bike.  I guess he was white.  And what the hell?  Let's kill him.  Any hate crime charges?  No.  No.  Only one of them being charged as an adult.  Just despicable, the double standard, and how no one opens their mouths when it's that way around.  If five white kids beat their life out of a black kid, you would see marches, demonstrations.  They'd be called for the death of the parents of the kids, never mind the kids themselves. 
[01:16:00]  Well, it's just an atrocity.  It's a very, very sad story.  You know, you've got to get the leaders on, like you said, on those cases.  Yeah, where are they?  They've got to talk.  It gives them no credibility when they can't look at both sides of something.  Oh, absolutely.  You're correct.  Motorhead, why did you call?  Well, I was just kind of voicing my opinion over this Obama son of a bitch get involved in a local matter  with a local police department with his Harvard professor. 
[01:16:30]  You know, it's bad enough we take a shellacking in the press because one idiot managed to get through the process  of being selected to be a law enforcement officer, and he's tasing toddlers or something like that  or raped somebody in his patrol car.  You know, that's bad enough.  We get enough press.  But then when two officers or how many officers were there are actually doing their jobs and are berated  to the point where this person needed to be taken in just to, if anything, just to quiet him down 
[01:17:00]  and show him the error of his ways, the president of the United States came out against cops.  Without even knowing all the facts.  Well, I think this hurts Obama.  Oh, it definitely does.  I know a lot of people are outraged by Obama's remarks, but I think this really hurts him in the end.  I think it was really stupid on his part.  He should have kept his statements very vague.  We were discussing this before the show.  Just keep it very vague.  Obviously, he had to say something because he knows the guy personally.  But, man, he went all in, which was just a dumb move on his part. 
[01:17:30]  And here it is also.  That speech that he had, that press conference, was for the health care plan, period.  And then the last question is this question from this woman reporter.  She stands up and asks him about the situation with the cop and what turns out to be one of Obama's asshole buddies.  This professor of black studies is one of Obama's asshole buddies from the past.  So Obama goes off for three minutes on this story. 
[01:18:00]  Three minutes is a long time when you're standing at that podium.  Goes off for three minutes and has no facts on it.  Really has no facts of what happened.  Just a basic idea of what happened.  Yet goes right to his friend's side and criticizes the police department as being stupid, acting stupidly when he doesn't even know what happened.  The guy was belligerent.  He was accusing this officer of being a racist. 
[01:18:30]  Meanwhile, he has an exemplary record as a police officer.  He was the guy that taught a racial profiling course for five years to the academy.  So this guy wasn't a know-nothing guy about racial profiling.  He taught the damn thing.  He was very experienced about it.  Very experienced, and a black officer who he worked side-by-side with in that course said that this guy is just an amazing police officer who has nothing to be embarrassed or apologize about. 
[01:19:00]  Sergeant James Crowley.  They've got to be feeling a lot of heat up there in Boston so far.  But they're not.  Thank God for Boston Police Department.  They could give a flying fuck, and I love them for it.  Well, you know what?  Today they could give a flying fuck.  Yeah.  This is – I'm going to – it's going to be curious how it plays out the next week.  I'm just saying I hope it continues down this road.  Trust me.  Unfortunately, NYPD, I think it would be a different story.  You think NYPD would have folded?  Oh, Bloomberg would jump in and this and that, and the commissioner would have to say something. 
[01:19:30]  Boston's police department, or actually Cambridge police, but when you're up there in that area, it's a whole other animal, man.  Those cops are like, you know, we know what we're doing up here.  Everyone else could go fuck themselves.  Yeah.  We've seen it.  The whole city's like that.  The whole city's like that.  They still believe in racism, like, openly up there.  Yeah, yeah, separatism and segregation and stuff.  Oh, I do.  They are insane.  Barferston.  Barferston, right.  Barferston. 
[01:20:00]  What did Mayor Menino have to say?  No one understood him.  I'm sure he hid, but when it comes to firing shock jocks and getting involved with radio issues, he's all in.  How about this one, Mayor?  Yeah, how about you jump out and talk about this?  I don't say it's not my territory, because Cambridge literally, you know those movie posters?  Yeah, yeah.  They're back-to-back, Cambridge and Barferston.  But this cop said in a live interview, he said, I'm not, he was asked if he would apologize.  I want to hear this audio.  I haven't heard it yet.  He said, I will not apologize.  Can we get that?  He goes, well, in the future, he goes, does that mean never? 
[01:20:30]  And he goes, yeah, never.  Good for him.  And he goes, what if, he was asked, what if, what does it mean if you maybe have to apologize or you can be reprimanded or lose your job even?  He goes, it's not going to happen.  He goes, I have the backing of my department.  I can't be more appreciative about that.  He has the backing of his union.  Really?  And for now.  The commissioner came up and said that.  I'm a little nervous about what you're saying.  For now, it sounds great.  But it's kind of like, you know, though, no, it's kind of like the radio business.  No, we got the backing of the company. 
[01:21:00]  It was a sponsored event.  They're telling us to hang in there.  Next thing you know, you're reading a fake apology.  God, I hope this guy doesn't have to read a fake apology.  Maybe I'm being naive.  But I tell you, the way this guy was talking, the way that his boss, the commissioner, the Cambridge police commissioner was talking, I really.  But when the president's involved in any way.  But the president looked stupid.  I know he did.  It wasn't like the president came out and said something that was like, wow, yeah, this guy's fucked. 
[01:21:30]  The president came out and came off sounding stupid to the point where the White House had to say that what Obama meant was that cooler heads should have prevailed.  He wasn't calling anyone stupid.  But when you say the police acted stupidly, you're calling them stupid.  Don't fucking when I love when the White House spokesperson comes out and completely changes what the president said, because that's what he said.  And they acted stupidly. 
[01:22:00]  And he said this with no fact.  I read the entire police report last night in between four hours of pornography.  And back to the future three.  Yeah, yeah.  And back to the future three.  I read the entire police report.  And this cop, in my opinion, based on what I know about past things like this, about knowing a lot of police officers, knowing a lot about the law.  I do a lot of research on shit like this, believe it or not, in between porno.  Now, and this cop was justified in what he did. 
[01:22:30]  This gentleman was causing a ruckus.  Could the cop, could he have left and just left this guy at his house?  He probably, of course he could have.  I don't know if he could have.  This guy was yelling at him.  Yeah, there was a complaint by women walking by the house, seeing this guy breaking into a house.  Yeah.  So now the cops are involved.  They go there.  They can't really leave that situation.  But after they determined that this guy was indeed the owner of the residence, there was the end of the story. 
[01:23:00]  And the cop was leaving.  He was leaving.  And the professor kept saying, what's your name?  Hold on.  Is there witnesses that say that he was leaving?  The cop, in his statement, and a cop was outside looking in the front door.  Right.  And there was the woman that initially made the complaint.  I'm saying the cop could back it up that, look, I was actually leaving.  He goes, I was leaving.  Right.  He goes, he was leaving the premises.  And he was being berated by this guy.  He was being called.  You know something?  When you accuse, if you're a black man in the position of power, as this fucking professor is, in his black studies course. 
[01:23:30]  Where can I enroll in white studies?  Can I?  All right.  Yeah, that's right.  I can't.  Because that's called the Ku Klux Klan or something.  It's just amazing.  But this guy, when you use the word racist the way this guy did, you take it and you take away from people that are really being treated in a racist way.  And this guy calling this cop a racist was an insult. 
[01:24:00]  He's yelling it where people in the street are hearing this.  He's ruining this cop's credibility.  Can I tell you something?  It's especially an insult to this cop who has a lot of knowledge, like you said.  Five years experience teaching about racial profiling to the academy.  So a guy like that obviously has an interest in this whole thing and then is now called a racist.  That's got to hit him right in the soul.  And what he did was he just stepped, he was stepping away from that situation like, all right, we're done. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  And he said to the guy, because apparently the professor at that point wanted to discuss this more.  He wanted the officer's name, which he gave him twice and wouldn't stop yelling, I want your name, I want your badge.  And Officer Crowley said, Sergeant Crowley said, I gave you that information twice, sir.  And he goes, you want to discuss this anymore?  You step outside.  I'm not going to do this in your house.  So when the guy stepped outside, he kept yelling and yelling.  And that gave the officer the opportunity. 
[01:25:00]  He said, you know something?  I got my cuffs out.  He goes, you're going to be arrested.  And there were people there.  He goes, you're disturbing the peace.  And he arrested him.  Completely legitimate.  Some people, of course, would say, well, he baited him to come out.  He did this.  The professor wants to be that stupid and step out of his house at that point.  That's him.  But, again, most of the black studies professors I have had experience seeing on the news, seeing as pundits, seeing giving interviews, have a huge chip on their shoulder against white people and against police officers. 
[01:25:30]  What they're teaching in these schools a lot of times is hatred and separatism.  And this guy doesn't seem, in my opinion, to be any exception to that rule.  And if I'm a police officer and I'm being accused of being a racist in front of the public and in front of my fellow officers, that, to me, is not only disturbing the peace. 
[01:26:00]  It's slanderous.  Right.  Motorhead, you got anything else on this?  No, I think, well, shit, Anthony steals your thunder whenever he gets going.  I'm sorry, sir.  Well, this is one of Anthony's.  I just want to say, you know, thanks for, you know, sticking up for us a little bit.  And the other thing I was going to bring up is Anthony or Shelby's for punks.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  What do you got?  I got that 98.  I don't know if you ever go on Wattberry.  I got that 98 Camaro SS with about 900 horse. 
[01:26:30]  900 horse?  All right.  Yeah, she's on the bottle.  That must be good.  Drive in the rain, you prick.  I can't make a left or right with this.  No, exactly.  It's a straight line car.  Motorhead, we got to cut you off because the phones, everybody wants in.  Cool, man.  Watch it out, buddy.  Later, bro.  And this is definitely one of Anthony's strengths.  He knows this shit.  Bill in Philly, what do you got?  There was, on ABC News yesterday, they had the mayor of Cambridge, who's a black woman,  had said the first thing that she did when she heard about this horrible story is call 
[01:27:00]  the professor and apologize for the police doing that.  And again, no knowledge.  No facts out.  Yeah.  Just astounding.  This morning on the news, they had some black gentleman from Washington, D.C. called in and  said how out of place that guy was for doing it.  He said, as a black man, when the police come to my house or whatever, he's like, I'm very  polite.  I teach them with nothing but respect.  He said, that's what he should have done.  He said, he blamed Gates.  Right off the bat, when this police officer approached this professor at his front door, 
[01:27:30]  there was a burglary or attempted break-in in progress.  So the cop goes up there, and he's got to question the guy, and he immediately got a belligerent  son of a bitch who had a chip on his shoulder against the police, calling him a racist.  It's like, why did he pull that?  Why did he have to do that?  Why wouldn't he go, thank God, I got police officers here that are looking after my house, 
[01:28:00]  and apparently his door was broken from a previous break-in, is what I was reading in  the report.  I was writing something to Danny, but yeah.  It's like, Jesus Christ, the guy's there to help you out.  This was the second break-in in the week, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So maybe the cop's there, you know, to help you out, and you got to jump right on him  about being a racist, about asking for your identification, asking what you're doing there.  It's like, hey, sir, can I ask you what you're doing? 
[01:28:30]  Why do you got to ask me what I'm doing?  Because I got a call that there's a break-in in progress.  Now I have to check into this.  You want to give me your ID?  Who are you?  Basic police work.  I'm a cop.  You idiot.  Yeah, it's basic police work at that point.  Yeah, basic police work.  Gates got his house broken into three days before, yeah.  Yeah.  Enough with this guy.  You don't learn about minority issues in regular school.  What?  What are you talking about? 
[01:29:00]  Minority issues?  Do we have to?  Who's this?  Yeah, this is Al.  Hi, Al.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on?  All right, look, Anthony a few seconds ago said that where can I enroll in a white studies course?  What I'm getting at is that when you go to a regular public school, public middle schools,  what you primarily are taught is like Renaissance, it's English history, like English American.  You get a month for black history that they put in there, but you don't really learn anything  about any of the other minority studies. 
[01:29:30]  It's shoved down our throats on a daily basis.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  In school, the schools are packed with liberal teachers that can't help but put out revisionist  history.  Maybe we're taught English history.  Maybe we're taught history, Renaissance history, because unfortunately, I'm sorry, it was a lot  of white people back then doing a lot of the stuff around the globe.  Sorry if we're not teaching African studies where the wheel hadn't been invented yet. 
[01:30:00]  You know what I mean?  Perhaps we're learning about German history and European history because that's what was  happening at the time.  Roman history.  Could you imagine going to school right now?  No!  Oh, my God.  I'd lose my mind.  Oh, my God.  When we went to school, was it as liberal?  Did we have to call it an African-American board that the teacher writes on now?  I don't know.  I haven't been to school in a while. 
[01:30:30]  Was it as liberal when we were going to school?  No.  No.  And we were just too innocent to know or understand?  I don't think it was at all.  I don't think so either.  I think teachers have always had a little bit of a liberal leaning.  Maybe not in the 50s, but now it's just crazy.  All right.  This guy.  I love the people that say, don't be a pussy and do such and such.  I think our record proves that we're not pussies on the radio.  First of all, Darren.  Jesus.  Darren McDaniel from Augusta, Georgia. 
[01:31:00]  We're not pussies.  Look into our history.  That's one thing we're not is pussies.  I'm also reading here.  He showed his school ID.  He showed his ID.  Right.  And then they got the university police.  The cop actually got university police over there to confirm that it was this guy.  But the guy kept just bashing and making accusations of racism against this police officer.  So Darren goes, Opie, don't be a pussy.  And I think our history shows we're not. 
[01:31:30]  First of all, let's get that out of the way, Darren.  You're probably a newer listener.  Ask Ant why it's okay to berate a meter maid just doing her job.  Ugh.  Wait a minute.  Why is it fair to berate a meter maid just doing her job?  Ask Ant why it's okay.  Oh, oh, oh.  Because they're...  I guess this guy has meter maids in his family or something.  No, because they are automatons.  They are machines that you cannot speak to.  You cannot reason with. 
[01:32:00]  And in some cases, they're completely right.  When there's double parked trucks on roads that you can't get past because they're there, I have no problem when they're getting a ticket like that.  Can I tell you why I have...  Go ahead.  I interrupted you.  But there are cases where you are either...  And this is where my point comes in.  I don't even say that.  You know, as far as them doing their job, it's one thing.  The guy's right.  Thank you.  What they're doing, as far as they're doing their job, I don't have an argument.  Thank you.  If you parked illegally, who's to argue? 
[01:32:30]  They gave you a ticket.  Whatever.  But it's the way they go about it.  Well, it's that.  And the problem I have with meter maids is very simple.  They don't listen to you as a human being, and they don't give anyone a fucking break.  End of story.  End of story.  Because I've seen...  I think we've all seen the mother running with...  I know this is going to sound like the lamest example, but I really did see this.  A mother running with her kid, obviously, has all hell breaking loose, and she's just trying to buy something. 
[01:33:00]  And the meter runs out literally that second.  Yep.  And now you've got the mother with a crying baby or something, you know, going, could you give me a break?  I was just in the store.  I know it just ran out, but please, please, please.  And they just look down and ignore the person.  Yep.  That's why they drive me insane.  And when they sit there for alternate side parking, waiting, while looking at their watch, and then they'll write the ticket, the second, you know, the minute hand.  And even before.  I've seen them write tickets before the time and just put down it.  Dude, I lived that life because I lived on a side street. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, I lived on a side street in New York with a car.  You did it in Brooklyn.  And they have a meter made, whatever the fuck you want to call these assholes, you know, stationed on pretty much every corner.  I think they got like two, maybe three blocks that they're responsible for.  And all they do is just wander back and forth in these streets trying to catch people where their meters are running out.  And in some cases, like you said, writing tickets before the actual meter runs out, knowing that the person is not going to be back in time or it's going to be really close. 
[01:34:00]  Or in my case, where I double parked with my blinkers on to run in some luggage from a long weekend.  And by the time I came back out to get my second load, I swear to you, I couldn't have been gone more than a minute.  It had to be less than a minute.  And I had a ticket.  How does that happen?  What happened?  And they're gone.  So you can't even discuss it with anybody because they're a bunch of pussies.  They run and hide like cockroaches.  Imagine police officers always acting like that, where now you get pulled over or you're doing something. 
[01:34:30]  Cops give a lot of people a lot of breaks.  Believe me, they do.  And I'm not even talking me or anything with the show.  I've had breaks.  I've had breaks without even pulling the radio show guy.  You know, you get breaks.  You can talk to a police officer.  They're humans.  These are just like, like I said, automatons, all from the same mold.  And, yeah, they're just despicable.  But, you know, whatever.  I could berate them.  What is Pete saying?  Pete in Cincinnati. 
[01:35:00]  Pete.  I wasn't accusing them of being anything also.  I wasn't using the R word.  Right.  Guys.  What's up, Pete?  It's supposed to be a Friday show.  Let's have a little fun.  We're having fun.  Seriousness all week.  We had an Asian guy spitting on a retard's dick yesterday.  Come on.  Cut us some slack.  Really?  We fucking.  We went home feeling like we were too intelligent.  Not intelligent.  I'm sorry.  We felt like cavemen yesterday.  Let us show some intelligence today. 
[01:35:30]  I had a 65 IQ driving home yesterday.  I couldn't understand street signs.  Go somewhere else.  That guy doesn't even own that house.  Did the guy yell Obama president now?  Yeah.  You know, this is how we kind of, you know, judge if we're doing good radio.  If the phones just are lit and this is all they want to talk about, we're not going to  go back to Bobo getting hard odds right now.  I'm sorry.  You know, there are some things we think are working on the radio and the phones are dead.  Yeah.  We're like, okay, we really got to move on and get these people interested in something. 
[01:36:00]  Like hearing from the listeners.  Looks like the guy will get an apology because it was his own property.  I can't see that.  Uh, uh, just graduated high school.  I can tell you a million things about the Holocaust and slavery.  Nothing about the Renaissance.  See, that's the new age we're living in is this revisionist history kind of a thing that's  going on where, um, you know, it's assumed that white history or European history is taught 
[01:36:30]  just by living your life, like you're ingrained in it just because you're white or because  you're, you're living in America that it just seeps into your head.  So all they have to teach you in school is about, uh, blacks, slavery, um, uh, uh, and, and,  and things that what weren't brought up years ago, I guess.  I don't know.  I haven't been in school in, in years, you know, I'm centuries.  I'm going to, uh, you know, I'm going to have, uh, kids.  I'm still, uh, you know, into doing that whole thing. 
[01:37:00]  And, uh, I can't do it before you're out of your thirties.  Yeah.  Well, that means I only got a year left.  I know a year.  I get, get, get, get a move on nine months at this point.  Wow.  Yeah.  Uh, I can't imagine sending a kid of mine to public school.  I can't imagine where you can't celebrate Valentine's day anymore and mother's day and  all that shit.  We can't celebrate mother's day or father's day because some kids don't have one.  Right.  Hey, that was just it.  Sorry.  That teaches you lessons about life. 
[01:37:30]  It's not always going to work out your way.  Sometimes you're not going to be included.  And so, and those kids that didn't have the mommy or daddy, they, they were treated real  nice that day.  Yeah.  They got the extra cookies and shit.  That's like, it's one of those things.  From the teacher that brings in the extra pair of underpants.  Isn't that nice?  She would give you nice little hugs.  It's okay.  You don't have a mommy.  Here, why don't you suckle on my breast for a while?  Oh, I never went to that teacher.  It's true.  It's like, it teaches you that you're not going to be included in everything.  Dude, I don't know how I'm going to do it because, you know, I'm hoping that my kid 
[01:38:00]  is athletic.  You know, I, I, I want my kid to be in all sorts of sports.  No competition now.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't know how, I don't know how I deal with it.  Yeah.  I don't know how I deal with that.  You're going to be one of those dads that run onto the field and punch the ref in the  face.  And they're going to have to probably be on the news.  God, you son of a bitch.  I'll probably take like, I would probably try to run the league, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  For real.  Five year old league.  And, and go, all right, this is what we're doing over here. 
[01:38:30]  We still believe in competition.  We still believe in winners and losers.  You'll have protesters to deal with.  It'll be great.  What it comes down to is explain to your kid, you know, yeah, it does suck to lose, but you  can learn from that.  But here it is.  What did you do?  You can learn from that.  That you can do next time.  That'll make it better.  That you can now win.  Like that's, how the fuck do you learn how to win if you don't lose?  Like, I don't get it.  How could you want to win if it's just as good losing? 
[01:39:00]  Like if they teach you that we don't keep score or, or, you know, there's no winners  or losers.  Everyone's a winner here.  No.  Now, now go into the corporate workplace and tell your boss that.  Yeah.  Hey, there's no winners or losers here.  Look, this guy, uh, build, uh, this much this, uh, month and I built this much.  Yeah.  We don't need numbers.  Yeah.  There's no winners.  I'm, I'm what?  I can clean up my what?  Yeah, exactly.  You know why humans are fucked?  It comes down to something very, very easy.  We're going against nature.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  You could summarize it with that statement right there. 
[01:39:30]  We're going against nature.  Basic human nature.  Instincts.  If you look at nature and what goes on in nature, that's what's supposed to happen with humans.  Competition.  Competition.  Survival of the fittest.  All that shit.  Yeah.  You can't save everybody.  I mean, we used to joke about it, but not all the baby turtles, you know, make it to  the ocean.  That's nature right there.  I haven't seen the baby turtle documentary in a while.  They ought to put, put one out again.  Right.  Where you watch some little flapping turtles and the seagulls are circling above and eating 
[01:40:00]  them.  They're not supposed to all make it.  No.  They'll fuck things up if they all make it.  That's nature.  Yep.  But we, we think we're smarter than nature, human beings.  And we, we're just going to ignore what nature has taught us from the beginning of time.  Yeah.  And we're just going to ignore that and, and try to do it differently.  And try to be something we're not.  And that's why we will lose in the end.  It's inevitable.  People, they try to think that we're something we're not.  They try to take the animal out of humans.  Right.  We, we're, we're basically, uh, uh, animals. 
[01:40:30]  We're very smart.  We have an opposable thumb.  We can build things.  But we're, we're basically still creatures.  Are we really that smart?  Uh, well, relatively speaking to what's on this planet.  It depends.  I think your, yeah, I think your definition is smart too.  Look, we could take shit out of the ground and build stuff that flies.  Yeah.  To me, that's amazing.  Of course.  Of course.  But, uh, and people mistake that for us not being animals and not having instincts, not  having, um, uh, wants and needs to be together with certain people and have fears, uh, of, 
[01:41:00]  of, of other types of people.  We just basically do.  Um, do we try to train ourselves to not be like this?  Yeah, sure.  But there's this instinctive thing in people.  It's going against the instinct that we all have in our souls.  And competition is, is a basic instinct based on, hey, if I don't fucking catch this animal before this guy does, I'm starving.  It's kind of like trying to, it's trying to make like the killer whales get along with the seals. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  No.  You know what I mean?  No, they're going to bat him with their tail and nose and then swallow him.  Sit down a killer whale and go, okay, look, I know you've done this for centuries and centuries, but it's a, it's a new way of looking at things.  You can't eat the seal anymore.  Be nice to the seal.  And oh my God, he ate him.  What happened?  We're fucked.  I'm telling you, you can't go against nature.  Yeah.  Uh, by the way, that guy, Darren, that I'd be rated.  Yeah.  He actually says that I'm his hero. 
[01:42:00]  So now I love, see how, see how you can turn me around.  It's so easy with us.  A little praise and we fall down.  He's my favorite listener of all time.  Just call me your hero and I'm in.  That's it.  Uh, I have too much respect for cops.  Really?  Uh, Graham at PA, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, I was just calling to say that, uh, cops are basically just members of a government  sanctioned gang.  I mean, they, they joined the police force for the same reason that, uh, hoodlums joined 
[01:42:30]  gangs because it serves, yeah, it serves their best interest.  Does it?  Yeah.  Now if, hmm, what about them putting themselves in horrifically dangerous positions for  no money, for basically shit money.  Yeah.  Uh, usually in horrid neighborhoods that don't want them there anyway, but keep calling them  because they can't stop beating the fuck out of each other, uh, doing drugs, uh, shooting  each other and missing and then hitting a baby.  What about that, Graham?  And not only that, after their job is over, they now go to the shitty neighborhood to live 
[01:43:00]  because they can't afford to live anywhere else.  What about that, Graham?  What, what, what, what about, what about that?  Well, women like, women like a man in uniform.  I'm sure they get a lot of pussy joined in the force.  Yeah.  You didn't address my question.  What about the fact that they have to go into shit neighborhoods with shit people that  don't want them there, but keep calling them to address problems like shooting each other,  stabbing their fucking wives or, uh, uh, girlfriends, whatever, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, drugs. 
[01:43:30]  Um, what about that?  What about, well, why not address that?  Why not have respect for the cops and not have respect for the hoodlum, uh, savage motherfuckers  that are shooting them in the face?  I'm not saying I respect either one more.  Well, it seems like you might respect the other one a little more.  No, it's just that they, they have a lot of authority.  That's just the price that you put in.  We give them authority.  That's the only way the police force works.  You don't give cops authority to do certain things. 
[01:44:00]  Then you're getting robbed.  You get, what are the cops supposed to say?  Please.  Thank you.  Okay.  I'll leave now.  Well, we give the cops a certain latitude because we don't want to do it.  That it's a quote from a movie.  I'm not sure which movie it was, but we give the cops that because we don't want to fucking  do it and we can't do it.  And if, if, uh, you want to look at them as a government sanctioned gang, uh, why?  Cause they all wear the same colors and they have a gun and they have the ability and, and 
[01:44:30]  are, are, are, are a tip of our hat to do certain things.  Then, you know, so be it.  Let me just say this though.  If, if all the laws changed and right became wrong and they were still upholding the laws,  then they would be the hoodlums.  And if I had a pussy, I'd be a girl.  What are you talking about?  It doesn't matter.  It's fucking the, but the rules aren't like that.  They they're like, they are now.  So the cops are out there enforcing laws.  Are all the cops good?  No, no. 
[01:45:00]  But, but you know something, you're not going to get any job where everyone's fucking,  uh, a saint.  But for the most part, cops are out there doing a shitty job dealing with fucking animals  on a daily basis that don't have the fucking right to walk this earth, but, and they got  to deal with them with respect and honor and shit because they could be thrown in jail if  they don't fuck them and fuck you.  They should all be shot in the fucking, uh, uh, uh, and I'm talking about gang members, 
[01:45:30]  not cops.  They should all be fucking put down.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Graham.  Uh, cops are decent people.  Meter maids are assholes.  Oh, there you go.  I would kind of agree with that.  I'm sure there's some meter maids to listen to our show.  Sorry, but don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying I've run into, I've run into cops that are complete fucking assholes.  I mean, I've been pulled over by cops that are just assholes.  It's not perfect.  They got chips on their shoulder.  It's not, it's not perfect, but I understand the position there.  They walk over to the car and instantly have this shitty attitude and you're like, all right, 
[01:46:00]  this guy, I understand why he became a cop.  He was beat up in school.  He's short.  He's this, he's that, he's whatever.  And that's why he's a cop.  But for the most part, the cops I've, I've, I've known and, and seen at work, at work,  you know, seen them working, um, documentaries, just, just things, just basic knowledge.  Uh, it's not that way.  Let's get, uh, Jay, a black guy from Ohio. 
[01:46:30]  Uh, he wants to give you the black perspective on the Cambridge situation.  All right, Jay.  What do you got, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Um, the thing is being a black guy, dealing with cops, you have to deal with them with a  little extra respect.  Cause usually the cops are a little heightened sense being, being black.  Why are they heightened?  Just answer me that.  Unfortunately, it's because of the situations that they usually deal with.  Exactly.  And I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't do anything but apologize for this. 
[01:47:00]  Because this is just, I actually, from what I heard at the beginning, I was with the professor,  but from hearing all the facts coming out, it's fucking bullshit.  I think it is too.  It's, it's one of those situations.  I gotta apologize for what's going on.  You don't have to apologize.  You know what it is?  Let me, let me, let me say, it makes, it makes my people seem like much of fucking  whining assholes.  You know what the solution is, Jay?  There is a solution and it's not an overnight solution.  The solution is that when something happens, if you're not committing a crime, but you 
[01:47:30]  get pulled over, look, there've been times I've been pulled over when I haven't really  done anything.  Uh, and, and you just, or I've been questioned, uh, as I'm walking into a place or something  and you answer with respect and stuff like that, it'll take a while.  But if you're not doing anything wrong and the police question you and you treat them  with respect and you're, you're set on your way, you don't have to have a chip on your shoulder.  And when the cops stop dealing with, um, uh, uh, a disproportionate number of, uh, minority 
[01:48:00]  criminals on a daily basis, then maybe they won't approach your car or another minority's  car with as much caution, uh, as they do.  Or with, uh, with, with that thought like, uh, Oh, uh, I'm not profiling, but I don't  want to fucking get shot tonight.  Exactly.  I got, I drive a big truck.  I was down in Southern Illinois last, uh, back in Memorial day, got busted doing 67 in 
[01:48:30]  the 55 cop, walked up to the car, took to the truck, talked to him for a couple of minutes.  He's like, you know, something just go on your way.  There you go.  Yeah.  You know, we all have an attitude when we get pulled over, by the way, we really do.  But a lot of us, you hide that fucking attitude.  But a lot of people realize that the attitude is not going to help you in that situation  whatsoever.  No, no cop is going to understand your attitude in the end.  They're just not.  So you got a choice.  You're not going to bite your lip and go, God, I want to say some shit right now. 
[01:49:00]  Cause I'm pissed off that I just got pulled over or you just deal with it.  So you don't make it worse.  That's it.  In the end, that's it.  Well, I watch these guys go across the scale and the DOT officer walk up to their truck.  And then start giving the DOT officer, uh, uh, issue.  Next thing you know, the DOT officer got some gloves out and getting ready to go through  the truck.  Yeah.  Now he's going to go through the truck now.  Oh boy.  You won.  You know, you don't win.  So whether you want to, even when the scumbag cop walks up to the window, you know, when 
[01:49:30]  these, if he's being a scumbag to you, you fucking bite your lip, you smile.  Because again, we give them the latitude to be the authority because that is what protects  us, whether you like it or not.  And sometimes you're going to be thrown into that light where you have to then be questioned.  You have to confront the police officer, not confront him, but, but, uh, be questioned  by him and, and, and treat him, uh, uh, respectfully, whether you want to or not, because you're 
[01:50:00]  not going to win.  There you go.  I had the asshole cops fool me over.  I used to date this white girl.  One cop used to fool me over all the time.  Now, now, now, Anthony's got a problem.  You just lost me, Jay.  Now, Anthony's got a problem.  Sorry.  I thought it was on the same page.  Aren't they sweet though?  Right?  Nice white ass.  God.  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  Listen, we got to take a break.  The phones are still on this topic, so we'll do a little more after the, uh, after the  break. 
[01:50:30]  Also, we got, uh, Obama's comments, which are pretty amazing.  Yeah.  We got Sergeant Crowley's comments.  Uh, he was on a radio station up there in Boston.  Has anyone done a song parody yet to Mr. Crowley?  Sergeant Crowley.  Yeah.  Come on.  Also, Jon Stewart, it's, it's now made CNN.  I guess he, he gave Obama, uh, kind of a beating over the whole thing.  Yesterday on the daily show.  How did he, he did that?  Jon Stewart. 
[01:51:00]  And, uh, and what else?  Oh, tell you the truth.  And, and for the guys down the hall, supposedly Chris Rock has a really funny little, uh, little,  uh, bit on black people being pulled over by cops.  We'll take a peek at that.  See if it's worth doing on the show.  And then I, I, I read on the, on the screen here, Danny just wrote that Rob Cross and Steve  Blatter need to approve any Bobo clips we replay today for your information.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Why is that?  This is satellite radio.  Get the fuck out of our way.  And it's a replay. 
[01:51:30]  And it's a replay.  You dummies.  It's already out there.  It doesn't matter.  There isn't any problem.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of our way.  What's going on?  And let us see what this satellite radio could do.  Don't, don't turn this into regular radio.  We still have an opportunity to show the difference between the two.  Does anyone know what the problem was with that bit in their eyes?  I, I, as far as, and, and it does, like Anne said, it's a replay. 
[01:52:00]  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't mean it's happening.  If it's already broadcasted, it doesn't matter anymore.  And if it happened, it happened.  There was no problems.  So let's let it roll.  I love when we have to cut shit out of replays.  It's like, do you understand?  It's already out there.  We, it's not like we, it was a practice show and we decided, wow, this is going to get  us in trouble.  We better get this out of the replay.  It's too late.  It already made the air.  Yeah.  And there's nothing in there that's going to.  Obama stands behind, acted stupidly remark. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  We're going to race relations in America on CNN.  We're heating up on many levels today.  So we'll take a break.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  I got to eat.  You gots to eat.  Yeah, yo.  Uh, all right.  Someone give me, why would someone give me ketchup with turkey and American cheese?  That's good.  On a bagel?  I mean, I appreciate the, uh, you know.  Well, if it was an egg sandwich, egg, turkey, a little cheese, a little ketchup.  Nice.  No. 
[01:53:00]  Nice.  Tangy.  Yuck.  On an everything bagel.  Nice.  I like one thing tangy.  Like cocks.  Butch put this together.  It was ranting about Obama the other day and, uh, and, uh, Butch did something nice  with it.  We'll continue.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Good morning.  So Obama, Cambridge, phone's still lit.  Everyone's talking about this Jon Stewart clip. 
[01:53:30]  So you want to take a listen and see what it's about?  Yeah, sure.  Because, uh, I think, I think, I think a lot of people are, uh, are noticing that Obama  just blew it on this one.  Yeah, this, this is kind of catching fire.  A lot of the, uh, a lot of the news shows have, uh, this story going on.  What about MSNBC?  Well, I'm sure they think, uh, Obama's, you know, completely right on this one.  What about Fox?  Uh, they would think Obama was wrong if he cured cancer. 
[01:54:00]  And CNN.  Uh, they're kissing Obama's ass too.  In between talking about Michael Jackson's nose and where is it?  Yes, the entertainment show, CNN.  That's the latest on Michael Jackson, by the way.  They don't know where his nose is.  Where's his nose?  Is it like Dillinger's penis now where they don't know where that is?  They said that, uh, someone who saw Michael Jackson in the autopsy room, whatever, the  nose is missing.  So there's basically two, like, holes where the nose...  Are you kidding?  That's what they're saying.  Wow, that's cool.  Yeah, it is. 
[01:54:30]  Ha ha.  Uh, all right.  So this is Jon Stewart talking about the Obama situation.  Recently, Professor Henry Lewis Gates Jr. was arrested at his home in Cambridge.  What does that incident say to you?  And what does it say about race relations in America?  Is that Boba?  Don't answer that! 
[01:55:00]  That's true.  It's Jon Stewart looking at a picture of, uh, Christina or some porn.  No!  I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played  in that, but I think it's fair to say that it's a complicated issue, and I don't really  have any comments at this time, because I wasn't there, and I don't know all the facts!  Exactly.  The Cambridge police, uh, acted stupidly. 
[01:55:30]  I couldn't save him!  I couldn't save him!  Now, I wasn't at the press conference last night, and I also don't have all the facts, but  I think it's fair to say that Obama handled that question, oh, what's the word I'm looking  for? 
[01:56:00]  Stupidly?  It's amazing, Obama used the word stupidly.  Stupidly?  The president.  He handled it stupidly.  All right, 56 minutes of press conference, 55 minutes and 30 seconds on healthcare, 30  seconds of racial controversy.  I wonder what the media will lead with the next day.  Let's go to the wheel and give it a spin.  Round and round.  Come on, healthcare, daddy needs a new hip replacement. 
[01:56:30]  I should have known, always bet on black.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, well, he's the one that decided, why would you have a press conference for your  healthcare plan, put all that work and effort into it, like Jon Stewart said, you know, put  that much time into not only coming up with a plan and trying to sell it to people and then  calling a press conference, and then at the end, you close with a racial thing. 
[01:57:00]  Huh?  Hands are up.  Let's see.  Greg?  It's the oldest trick in the book.  Distraction.  Is it the distraction?  Because he knows that America's not on board with this healthcare thing right now.  So it's the slide of hand?  Yes!  The little slide of hand?  It's like I didn't see him put the card behind there.  He knows there's problems with the whole healthcare thing.  He did a race card trick.  Yes.  It's not quite right.  So then you end the press conference with that, knowing the media. 
[01:57:30]  He's not stupid.  Obama really isn't stupid.  He knows how this whole thing works.  He handled it stupidly.  He did.  He knows the media is going to lead with that and ignore pretty much the whole healthcare  thing.  Healthcare thing, yeah.  Because that is just not in good shape yet.  Yep.  And he knows that.  So he's like, you know what?  We could use a good distraction here.  Because I think someone said that that question was set up even.  Yeah.  That that reporter stood up.  It was a plant and said, all right, now ask him about this, knowing the media is going  to run with what he says about that.  And he got a, you know, here's the Congressional Black Caucus woman. 
[01:58:00]  Now no one is talking about this healthcare thing, which is a biggie.  Well, the healthcare thing also, an announcement was made that it's not going to be signed by  the time Congress goes on their recess.  And Obama said, well, I hope then it gets signed by the first of the year.  How long is their recess?  It's a long fucking time.  Holy shit.  Where he's like, all right, I hope maybe we get something at least out there the first 
[01:58:30]  of the year.  Yeah.  I think they get the whole month of August off.  That that's how it used to be.  Then.  But now I think that they start in late July and then come back sort of in September.  Oh, they, they, they stretch this thing.  I'm not, maybe Danny can find out exactly, but, and then finally, uh, John Stewart went  with the montage of all the media jumping on this instead of the healthcare thing.  This is textbook.  Yeah, it is.  And welcome to today on this Thursday morning.  I'm Meredith.  And I'm Matt Lauer, president of Obama's primetime news conference last night, mostly about healthcare, 
[01:59:00]  but it was the comments he made at the end of that news conference about the arrest of  an African-American Harvard professor last week that are getting a lot of attention.  Everybody's talking about it.  The topic was healthcare, but it was that question at the end of the hour that has everyone talking  this morning.  Last night, President Obama during his news conference was asked about Henry Louis Gates.  Did he go too far and rewrite the headlines that should have been about healthcare reform?  Yes, he went too far.  But I believe you rewrote the headlines. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they know what the media wants.  And he played into it.  I hate the fact that, um, they say, uh, an African-American professor and a white police officer,  like, then call them something else.  Call them, uh, Irish American Crowley, right?  Yeah.  Well, cop up there.  Sure.  Gotta be.  Gotta be.  So, uh, just that, or say a black, because he, he, what's the course he runs? 
[02:00:00]  Is it African-American studies or black studies or something like that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But, uh, yeah.  Do you want more of the Obama statement?  Tired of the double standard.  I love the Obama statement.  All right.  Because we had the Stewart version, but, uh, let's, let's really go with the Obama statements.  Oh, yeah.  Instead of, instead of writing John Stewart's, uh, back today, we'll, we'll, we'll make this  entertaining too.  Here goes Obama off script.  Look out.  I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played 
[02:00:30]  in that.  Should end it.  But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us, whenever you hear, but in the middle  of a statement, you know, it's not going to be, especially after I wasn't there, you know,  it's never going to be in your favor.  When someone says, I understand.  Actually, I think we just went through that.  But any other president or politician in their right mind would have said, look, I don't  know the facts about this.  Uh, I'll look into it, but I really don't know this. 
[02:01:00]  And I think this is best handled by the people that were involved.  And, uh, you know, this, I'm doing a press conference here.  It's about healthcare.  So.  Right.  Right.  Let's, let's, let's keep the focus where it needs to be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where it needs to be.  He wanted this.  He wanted to do this.  What his motives were, whether it's a distraction or because he's asshole buddies with the professor  and wanted to do this.  Hey, look what I did for you, dude.  You know what?  The government's always looking for distractions.  Hence the bird flu.  Hence the swine flu. 
[02:01:30]  Bird flu.  What was that?  Oh, you go back a little bit.  Was that something that was really?  Yeah.  You know, then it turned out to be a bust, right?  I remember the good old days of shark attacks.  So remember, remember the summer of shark attacks?  What was going on that we were supposed to focus on that summer?  For real.  I think it was the war.  Because we were supposed to focus on something else, but they, they threw the shark attack.  Shark attack.  Distraction at us.  And we all bought into it.  It was the summer of, the summer of sharks, they called it.  Yeah.  Until something else hit the news.  So what, what happened? 
[02:02:00]  What happened that summer where, where they were focusing on shark attacks instead of the  real issues of the day?  It was the same year as Katrina.  And we all, the media does it.  And I love the fact that Jon Stewart doesn't acknowledge he's part of the media because we've  been doing that forever too.  Because then people call us out.  Aren't you part of the media?  No, there, there's, there's a separation that's going on with intelligent broadcasters going,  you know what?  No, they're the dummies.  And we're trying to like, uh, you know, expose them for the assholes they really are.  Yeah.  And I, I love, and we're just a dopey radio show. 
[02:02:30]  I love someone like Jon Stewart and the Daily Show is basically saying we're not the media,  even though they're, they're certainly are part of it, but they're trying to like separate.  They become more of the media now that a lot of, you know, that show is, is really, it's  news now.  Like I said, a lot of the younger people are getting their news from Jon Stewart.  It's a fact.  And you'd be silly to say, well, no, it's an entertainment show.  Look at the news every day where they're putting dancers on and they're, you know, doing skits  and sketches.  Sure.  So where is the separation? 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Here's Obama.  I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry.  Number two, that the Cambridge police, uh, acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there  was already proof that they were in their own home.  And number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is  a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos, uh, being stopped by law enforcement 
[02:03:30]  disproportionately.  All right.  That's just a fact.  I can't even deal with that.  I can't deal with that whole line.  I can't deal with that line.  There is a long history, right?  Exactly.  Holy Jesus.  Why?  Because there's a disproportionate amount of crime in those communities based on other  communities.  I hate using the word community, but there is a disproportionate amount of crime. 
[02:04:00]  Sorry.  It's fact.  You have the FBI at your beck and call.  Take a look at the stats.  They're available everywhere on the intratubes.  Look there.  I do.  I look at the FBI stats on crime based on a race and a demographic location.  And there's a disproportionate number.  So why wouldn't cops then, if they are looking for a shooting suspect, let's say, and that 
[02:04:30]  shooting suspect is a black male.  Why would they then question white women if they're looking for a black male that robbed  a liquor store or something like that?  I don't know.  Maybe because that's the description they were given.  Because they don't all look alike.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  It annoys the piss out of me that the president now is saying this.  It's bad enough when you see someone like Reverend Al saying it. 
[02:05:00]  He's not running the country.  He tried.  He runs radio.  He doesn't run the country.  He sure does.  I did not sexually assault Andrew McNulty.  Saturday was the first that I looked at.  Obama's good.  Is this still Obama clips?  I see what's going on here.  So, okay, Obama's statement, and then Sergeant Crowley responds to Obama.  How cool is that, though?  Now you're on the president's radar.  Maybe not that cool, but.  Yeah, maybe you don't want to be on the president's radar. 
[02:05:30]  I did not sexually assault Andrew McNulty.  Saturday was the first that I learned of her accusations.  Wait a minute.  That's not him.  Her false and vicious allegations are attack on my family.  I don't think he did that.  No.  What happened?  That would be the, uh, Rothfuss-  Yes.  Orger thing.  Yes.  No.  Where did that-  Sergeant Crowley did, uh, make a statement, though, to Fox News.  Sergeant Crowley! 
[02:06:00]  Da-da-da-da.  All right, I got it over here.  Why do you hate the blacks?  Ba-da-da-da-da-da.  All right, we got more Obama, and then this could be the Sergeant Crowley.  Things are a little mixed up right here, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Let's get back on track.  Obama.  You were tough on the Cambridge Police Department.  Do you regret saying that the Cambridge Police acted stupidly?  You know, I have to say I'm surprised by the controversy surrounding my statement, because  I think it was, uh, pretty-  First of all, why are you surprised? 
[02:06:30]  Dude-  You know this country.  Dummy.  And he lost me.  Where do you think you live?  What news have you been watching?  Of course they're gonna jump all over that.  He's, uh, he's the same guy.  Wow.  Same fucking guy.  Uh, I didn't, uh, I'm surprised at the controversy.  How are you surprised?  I'm surprised at the first black president, uh, bringing up a racial issue and getting it  completely wrong, um, and, and mouthing off before the facts were in. 
[02:07:00]  Uh, oh, wow.  And by the way, his number two that he said before, that, um, he was, uh, uh, arrested  after proving that he lived there and stuff, that wasn't the case.  He wasn't arrested for B&E.  He was arrested for a disorderly.  Right.  And, and Obama mouthed off about that before he got the facts.  Right.  It wasn't the fact that he, he had proven that he lived there.  That wasn't the case.  We said, I mean, according to the police report, the officer was actually leaving and the guy  was carrying on still and it got to a point where the guy goes, I got to arrest this guy. 
[02:07:30]  He's out in front of people.  Like he would do with anyone else that was in that position.  Yes.  White.  Making accusations of racism.  Yellow, purple, green.  Who gives a shit?  Man.  You get arrested in that situation.  God.  Because I think it was a pretty straightforward commentary that you probably don't need  to handcuff a guy, a middle-aged man who uses a cane, who's in his own home.  Now.  You know what?  Get over it.  All right.  People get handcuffed all the time.  But he uses a cane.  It's okay.  All right.  Now I agree.  You never do anything to a guy that uses a cane. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  I got him.  I'm with Obama now.  So the old guy used a cane.  Don't arrest him then.  People with a cane.  I would rob a bank with a cane under what Obama just said.  Let me go into a bank then and rob it with a cane.  Right.  Hey, hey, he's got a cane.  Obama said it's cool.  Now, what I do know is, as I said last night, I don't know all the details to the case.  I think that.  How does everybody, hold on, hold on.  How does everybody today, by the way? 
[02:08:30]  Now, this is, when was this done?  When was this taken?  Probably yesterday.  Okay.  Everyone knew the facts of the case by yesterday.  The police report was out.  It was out yesterday.  And you mean to tell me a story that was this big, this big of a story, that he didn't take  the time to review all the facts of the case, that he's still not familiar with the case?  That is bullshit.  Yes, hands up.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. 
[02:09:00]  I'm the only one in the room today.  I have to do it with the teacher.  He knew we blew it with his statement.  Yeah.  So now he's never going to know the facts of the case?  Well, so you can't acknowledge that you read all the facts.  And then it comes obvious to the people that, oh, see, he didn't have the facts before he  said what he said.  Yeah.  I love breaking this shit down.  It's one of my favorite things in the world to do.  But he's still saying he doesn't have the facts.  Because he can't now.  The first thing he was given was a stack of the facts. 
[02:09:30]  He just has to drill that into people's head, though.  I didn't have the facts.  I didn't have the facts.  I didn't have the facts.  He knows he's wrong by his statement at this point.  Oh, my God.  The case, I think that I have extraordinary respect for the difficulties of the jobs of  police officers.  As I said, their responding was exactly the right thing to do.  OK.  And my suspicion is, oh, is that words were exchanged between a police officer and Mr. 
[02:10:00]  Gates and that everybody should.  Yeah.  Not a suspicion.  Thank you.  He called up his buddy on the red phone.  Yeah.  And the Gates guy probably said, I kind of said something.  And by saying words were exchanged, it makes it sound like the police's words were as inflammatory  as the professor's.  Words were exchanged between the two.  Now, if you read the report and listen to the witnesses who actually heard this, the professor  was being loud, belligerent and making accusations against this officer. 
[02:10:30]  And the officer was being soft spoken, polite and leaving the residence.  Yeah.  So Obama's kind of, you know, through through his great way that he has with not saying  what he really means, like, you know, saying I'm taxing the crap out of you without actually  saying the word taxing.  Right.  Which is amazing.  He's doing the same thing right there.  Yeah.  There's definitely some backtracking, though, going on here with Obama.  Oh, yeah.  You could tell.  As much as he will.  And that everybody should have just settled down and cooler heads should have prevailed. 
[02:11:00]  That's my suspicion.  Not everybody.  The one guy.  But I was asked, you know, did it make sense for it to escalate to the levels that it did?  And I said, probably not.  No, you weren't asked that.  And you didn't say probably not.  It would have been more sensible for everybody to just, once it was established that Mr.  Gates was in his own home, that we should just settle this thing down.  Well, maybe he shouldn't have kept yelling at the police officer and accusing him of being  a racist.  Perhaps that should have stopped. 
[02:11:30]  Maybe his cooler head should have prevailed.  And you didn't say any of that.  What I said was, what I know you didn't.  You called the police stupid.  You called the Cambridge Police Department stupid.  They handled it stupidly.  So that is stupid, is the root word of stupidly.  He realizes that public opinion is that he blew it.  So he's backtracking.  As best he can.  Because you're still, even when you backtrack, you got to, you know, save a little face,  right?  I guess so. 
[02:12:00]  So that's what he's doing.  He's like, I can backtrack to right about here.  Any further back, though, and I look stupid.  Now I start looking stupid.  So he makes up things that he said that he didn't really say, or says he meant it this  way, but he used the word stupidly.  And conveniently say that you didn't read the police report, that's a biggie.  You're the president, and you're right in the middle of this issue, and you're not reading  the police report?  Come on.  Or someone's not reading it for you and giving you the bullet points?  You know what else really pisses me off?  The cops can, I can understand them calling each other stupid, but there shouldn't, you 
[02:12:30]  shouldn't be allowed if you're not a cop to call each other stupid.  You should say the S word.  Because only cops should be able to call each other stupid.  You're my stupid.  You know?  Yeah, I like that.  Sergeant Crowley.  So we finally get to hear from him.  He was on WEEI yesterday.  As I said yesterday when I was cornered in my backyard by the media, that apology will 
[02:13:00]  never come.  It won't come from me as Jim Crowley, and it won't come from me as a sergeant in the  Cambridge Police Department.  Whatever anybody else chooses to do in the name of the city of Cambridge or the Cambridge  Police Department is beyond my control, and I don't worry about that.  I know what I did was right.  I have nothing to apologize for.  He doesn't have to worry about a thing.  You know what, though?  Mark Furman dropped the M-bomb, allegedly, and he's all over CNN now.  You know what?  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  That's a guy that has the backing of his bosses.  Oh, he does.  You could tell.  That would be a nice thing to have, huh?  You could tell.  The backing of the bosses.  Yes.  Instead of making the fake apologies.  Well, I'm just saying, instead of making the fake apologies.  I'm talking about the past, Dan.  Relax.  Right?  I see the red flag.  I just red flagged.  I'm just talking about our situations in the past where we thought we had the backing  of the bosses, and we did not.  I know.  So then we had to go on the air with the...  You know why?  Fake apology time. 
[02:14:00]  And let me tell you why I think he does have the backing of his bosses, and not like we  thought we did when they would come.  Because his boss went out in public and backed him.  We have never...  Behind the scenes, when they would tell us, you know, hey guys, no, we're going to stick  with you on this one.  We just got to ask you some questions and review this.  Yeah.  Never in public did they come out and back us.  Yeah.  But this guy, his boss, publicly backed him and said he supports him.  He's a great cop, and that's that.  We acknowledge we've fucked up in the past. 
[02:14:30]  But there has been a few situations, like, you've got to be kidding me, you're not backing  us on this one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The homeless Charlie thing to this day is so ridiculous.  I can't even tell you.  Ridiculous.  And they could have backed us on that.  A homeless guy's ranting and raving, and the company doesn't back us on that one.  And we get suspended for 30 days.  And actually, we were supposed to get fired, but someone kind of figured out how to keep  us employed.  Oh, by the way, remember how all the newspapers reported that we got suspended for that with  no pay?  We got paid. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  We sat out.  Yeah.  Had an easy life for a month.  We had a month vacation paid.  Yeah.  Thanks.  We got to sleep paid.  We actually, actually, they did us a favor.  Thank you, homeless Charlie.  They did us a favor.  I slept late.  Slept late.  It was wonderful.  Got all our money.  That was fantastic.  And became more famous.  Thanks.  Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh,  Well, not only in my mind, we have a professional standards unit that conducted an inquiry right  after this event, and I believe they canvassed the neighborhood and spoke with the caller 
[02:15:30]  and any other witnesses.  Had I deviated from that which is acceptable and that which is a standard policy, then I  would have been corrected for it.  I would have been disciplined for it.  Correct.  There you go.  See, he's sticking by what he did.  He's a cop.  He's been one for a lot of years, a sergeant.  He taught the racial profiling course at the academy.  So I think this guy's pretty qualified to know what he should or shouldn't be doing in  a certain situation.  Sorry.  That's just the way it is. 
[02:16:00]  If he was some kind of lunkhead.  A lunkhead.  They would have sacrificed him immediately.  Some kind of dolt.  Right.  Oh, they've been plenty of cops they've just thrown to the wolves, whether they were right  or wrong, unfortunately.  And we also learned this guy gave mouth-to-mouth to Reggie Lewis when he collapsed.  Up there in Boston.  That was performing the CPR on him.  If that's true, I don't know, because I haven't read it myself.  I heard that.  It is true.  That has been confirmed, Opie.  Yes.  A real racist guy.  Yeah.  Summer of shark attacks was because of the gas crisis. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, was that it?  Bobo wants to grind the show to a halt to let you know he's doing fine.  Footer.  No one has ever called Obama out.  All right, wait.  Grind the show.  Bobo, you all right?  And I've been telling everybody that Bobo will not be on the show.  I'm all right.  All right, good.  Footer.  What do you got?  What's up?  Hey, footer.  Hey, man.  Hey, the biggest thing is why I think Obama was, like, surprised in some way that people  are criticizing him on this is because no one fucking, like, as you say, and no one 
[02:17:00]  ever says anything to him.  Oh, my God.  You're right.  So for anybody to even think of saying something to him, he's all fucking blown out of shape  and, like, you know, he's out of shape.  He doesn't understand it.  He doesn't know how to deal with something like that.  You know what?  You're absolutely right.  None of the reporters or anybody, they've been treating this guy with kid gloves the  entire time, and this is the first time he's being called out on something, and he doesn't  know what to do about it.  He's losing his mind, freaking out.  By the way, I saw this little thing on how he is treated with kid gloves, and he had 
[02:17:30]  a press conference last night, or the other night, of course, it was about health care,  and then this subject came up, but no one asked him a question about the soldiers, the  Iraq, or the fact that in Afghanistan, it's been one of the deadliest months ever for the  soldiers, and no one's asking him questions, what are you doing about it, why, how come  there's been this resurgence of the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and why are we 
[02:18:00]  losing so many soldiers?  Does this show maybe that they're coming back again in force because they see you being a  weaker president?  Do you think that's the perception that they get, that you're not a president that's going  to take decisive action on that?  Why not ask him those questions?  No.  Because it's boring.  Yeah, right.  To the media, anyway.  No, they don't want to ask him.  It would scare him. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you, sir.  Footer, I've got to move on.  Thanks, man.  We're just lit right now.  Joe in D.C., recess is July 31st through September.  Is that true, Danny?  You get the info on their vacation?  It's 30 days every August.  Plus, they have a week every day there's a federal holiday.  So if there's a federal holiday on a Wednesday, they get the whole week.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Come on, stop.  Come on, stop it.  What? 
[02:19:00]  When do we get into this vacation territory?  Do they work for the government or Sirius?  Satellite radio.  It says, Congress often holds business sessions only on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday so  that legislators can visit their constituents over a long weekend that includes a work day.  Bullshit!  Visit the constituents?  I've never gotten a visit.  That's bullshit.  Also, Congress recesses the week of a federal holiday.  The week!  And it says here, the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 stipulated a 30-day recess each 
[02:19:30]  August.  And here's the weird part, except in a time of war.  Hey, well, there must be a party going on over in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Is that it?  Except in a time of war.  Oh, they got rid of that little clause, huh?  Well, because I guess they don't declare a war.  It's not a declared war.  If it's a declared war, then it's different.  What is that?  Well, you know something?  When soldiers die...  Yeah, we're only fighting for our lives right now.  When soldiers die based on people sending them, a government official sending them overseas  to fight somebody, I would say that's a war. 
[02:20:00]  That's an insult to every soldier and every soldier's family, especially the ones that  have lost their son or daughter.  They don't really consider it a war.  Let me ask you something else.  Do you...  What constituency that they represent voted for them taking a week off for a one-day  holiday during the week?  That is where I say that they are not representing us.  If they were representing us, who voted for that?  Do you think they put that to a vote to the people? 
[02:20:30]  Hey, we'd like the whole week off when there's just a day.  Right.  Can we get...  What is that called?  The fucking...  Is that the Carleese law?  Can we enact that?  We want to enact the Carleese law.  Big Earl from Philly.  Black gentleman.  Important to the discussion.  Usually, we don't care.  If you're a fan, you call, whatever.  But when it matters and...  You know what I'm trying to say?  Yeah, you're backpedaling.  Yeah.  He's a black gentleman.  Anthony is right. 
[02:21:00]  I'm always nice to cops.  The reporter that knew Obama.  This is Chris in Phoenix.  The reporter knew Obama when he was a senator.  And then finally, we have this before we move on.  We got Kim in Staten Island.  Kim.  Hi, guys.  I love you.  My husband just started listening to you.  And every night, he came home to tell me how he thinks Anthony should run for president.  Oh, that would be great.  I could see the campaign now.  My opponent running everything I've done since I was 19 years old till now. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  I pretty much threw away my political career chances.  Yeah.  They could just scrape the surface and get all sorts of dirt.  There's plenty of dirt in my life.  Now, imagine you're the best man for the job.  But, I mean, there's just, you know, there's a little too much skeletons laying out of the closet door.  The commercials for your opponent would be awkward to watch.  Yeah.  Do you want him to thank you, Missy? 
[02:22:00]  Well, I think we got some stuff on that.  Time is running out.  Tick tock.  The American middle class is shrinking every day.  You know, the people that are hard pressed, we have to help bring them up.  These economic challenges call for strong leadership.  But not everyone agrees.  Some people are starting to go like, hmm, does this guy know what the fuck he's doing?  Senator Nagel says, Anthony Cumia is the Antichrist.  Of course.  Chairman Teff says, Cumia will destroy us all. 
[02:22:30]  Nope.  Chief Justice Roberts proclaims, Cumia will wipe his ass with the Constitution.  Enough already.  Wise, benevolent, and even-tempered.  Anthony Cumia has the solution to our nation's economic crisis.  Just tax the shit out of everybody.  Liberal-minded philanthropist Anthony Cumia will restore balance to our nation.  It is like the old communist method of everybody gets a piece of the pie.  Say no to discretionary income. 
[02:23:00]  Say yes to a mountain of costly social services.  This fall, vote for Anthony Cumia.  That's what I am.  Tax and spend Democrat.  You got it.  Paid for by the United Negro College Fund in cooperation with the NAACP.  Yay!  I like that one.  Hey, Whitney Dubs from D.C. writes,  Okay, hypocrites.  I've listened to this show for years.  You have never bitched about the Republican Party taking a recess.  Are you kidding me?  What?  We constantly bitch about Congress. 
[02:23:30]  That's not a party thing.  I don't even care.  That's just ridiculous no matter who you are.  I don't even care what party they belong to.  I don't care.  It's just ridiculous.  But then someone else writes, this is actually good because the less time, it's John the Redneck.  Let him say it for himself.  John, go ahead.  Yeah, you guys look at this vacation stuff all wrong with them.  Yeah.  We need the motherfuckers only up there about two months a year.  The less time they're up there, the less they can fuck things up. 
[02:24:00]  That's wonderful that that's how we have to look at it.  But you're kind of right.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Rich in LBI.  Nice little town there, Rich.  He writes, how does President McCain sound now?  I'm not a fan of either.  Yeah, well.  Not a fan of the system that's in place right now.  Also.  We need some tweaking.  Also, how about any questions at all from the press to Obama about our U.S. soldier hostage? 
[02:24:30]  No.  Bergdahl, who's over there in Afghanistan.  Probably not a lot of tasks.  Sending videos.  Probably not a lot of tasks.  This poor guy is just sitting there in Afghanistan with the Taliban with a knife to his neck at any moment.  Hands.  Hands.  Let me look around the room.  Oh, Greg.  Because we don't have a true free press anymore.  And there's something that goes on. 
[02:25:00]  I think the documentary was called Outfox.  It's worth a watch.  It's really interesting how the media works.  And I believe that the reporters that are allowed into the inner circle and are allowed to get that close to the president and ask questions.  Yeah.  One mistake and they're gone.  You mean like a –  So the word gets around like, you know, it wouldn't be too smart to ask a question about probably one of the biggest things happening right now.  Yeah.  Because you'll be out.  You mean like one of Obama's top Secret Service guys in the White House that just recently got transferred off of Obama for questioning the fact that Obama, apparently – this is what the Secret Service gentleman said. 
[02:25:30]  And he discusses with his family about demographics, certain demographics around the country and how horrible things are going for certain – he talks a lot about race in the House.  And this Secret Service agent, I guess, did not really appreciate it and voiced his opinion and – get out. 
[02:26:00]  That's how it works.  Get out.  That's how it works.  Another thing about our great president –  Because why wouldn't one person ask a question about that poor soldier that is probably going to lose his fucking head?  Why would you ask that before you ask about the stupid professor being arrested story?  I mean, how about the soldier that is, you know, being held hostage?  Yeah.  We have a soldier being held hostage by a group that is just known to horrifically execute people. 
[02:26:30]  And, you know, Congress is going to just – eh, we're going to take our month off.  And Obama's talking about his buddy, his asshole buddy from one of the black study courses.  And there's – you know, we got – in Afghanistan, there's a soldier just sitting there.  You would think that would come up.  Boat bird doll.  Just sitting.  You would think that would come up.  Yeah.  Maybe someone should ask a question like, are there any plans on, you know, even talking to or negotiate – you know, obviously they don't negotiate with terrorists. 
[02:27:00]  But they always ask that question so the president could go, we don't negotiate with terrorists.  But – by the way, another great thing about our president is how during the 40th anniversary of the Apollo moonshot there when he had the three astronauts at the White House and was relaying a lovely story about him on his grandfather's shoulders in Hawaii when they were splashing down and how he imagined – and he was waving flags and imagining that he would actually talk to the astronauts. 
[02:27:30]  And it was a great memory for him.  He was in Indonesia from 1968 to 1971.  Maybe he came home for the weekend.  1969 falls in that fucking little slot.  He wasn't in Hawaii on his grandfather's shoulders.  He was in Indonesia.  Maybe he came home for the weekend.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Full of shit. 
[02:28:00]  More bullshit.  Boy, you don't give this guy a break at all, do you?  Fucking – no, I study it.  I study it.  And I believe it might have even been, like, earlier than 68.  This leads to this.  Or that leads to this.  Time is running out.  Tick tock.  The American middle class is shrinking every day.  I thought maybe it was a series.  You know the people that are hard-pressed.  We have to help bring them up.  These economic challenges call for strong leadership. 
[02:28:30]  But not everyone agrees.  Some people are starting to go, like, hmm, does this guy know what the fuck he's doing?  Senator Nagel says Anthony Cumia is the Antichrist.  Of course.  Chairman Tapp says Cumia will destroy us all.  Nope.  Chief Justice Roberts –  Yeah, that was the same one.  Of course.  What's going on with the guys today?  It's my clips, so I don't mind you playing them eight or ten times.  No, that definitely came in in two different forms.  Did it?  And then that other clip was part of the Obama thing. 
[02:29:00]  What's going on?  Oh, my God.  Is Steve out today?  And things are falling apart?  Oh, no.  He's here.  Wait a minute.  Know who's out today?  Who?  E-Rock.  Does E-Rock actually run the show?  Holy shit.  I knew it.  I knew it all.  He's the brains of the outfit.  He's the man behind the curtain.  E-Go.  E-Go.  We need E-Go.  E-Go.  We need E-Go.  We need E-Go.  We need E-Go.  Come on.  That fat fuck runs the whole operation.  I knew it. 
[02:29:30]  Wow.  Oh, here's Sam to say no, of course.  Sam couldn't get in here fast enough.  Jesus, Sam.  So, Eric Nagel, what you're demonstrating.  What's being demonstrated here is Eric Nagel.  Basically, if he takes a day off, the whole place falls apart.  The place goes to shit.  Comet.  Incorrect.  What happened?  Comet.  The problem with the clips, I guess you're just getting doubled up clips.  Oh, God.  That sounds like you're backpedaling, Mr. President.  And it's campaign ad, and then Anthony Comey election promo. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, Jesus.  That looks like it would be two different things.  It certainly does.  It made me very excited that we could play both.  I was supposed to know.  Yeah, I know.  I agree with that.  And Nagel would have known.  I tell you this.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Nagel.  Come on.  Nagel.  Come on.  Join.  Join in this chant.  No?  The shortcomings of people who are here do not.  Boo!  Listen.  The shortcomings of the people who.  Come on.  Get your fucking shine box.  Boo!  It's not Nagel.  Boo!  Eric Nagel is the guy that runs the show. 
[02:30:30]  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  Iraq.  For him to be so, like, behind the scenes with it.  Like, we goofed on him for so long, and he's never come up and said, guys, I'm the guy  that holds it all together.  That's the iron curtain.  Do the right thing and just fire yourself now.  It's not me!  You really should.  It's not me!  You came in here to bash Nagel, and obviously he's the guy that runs the whole friggin'  show.  Fire yourself instead of behind closed doors where no one hears from me again.  Come on, now.  Make it impressive.  Wait, what?  Just resign.  I'm not, no, I won't.  Resign. 
[02:31:00]  What are you doing at 10.30?  I just need to ask.  What am I doing?  I'll probably, I'll be doing E-Rock's job since he's not here.  Running?  Running the program?  Yes.  Well, no.  Efficiently?  No.  Smoothly?  No, he doesn't do that.  It's like a well-oiled Italian hero.  He sits there.  How the fuck did this happen?  We turned on E-Rock in a good way.  Because he's not here to hear it and bask in it.  He spends all his time.  By Monday, he'll be that fat son of a bitch.  Get E-Rock on the phone right now.  I need to praise him. 
[02:31:30]  He's probably not even picking up his phone.  He will.  He's not Steve C.  He can't pick it up.  No, he's not picking up.  Boom!  He's not picking up.  Of course Travis is going to say that.  I can just picture.  It makes Travis look bad if E-Rock picks up the phone.  As we're praising him, I just picture his fat body snoring and drooling on his pillow right now.  Nagel's the man.  He's not.  He just archives all the time.  Is E-Rock like Michael Jackson where he needs someone to feed him while he's sleeping?  Yeah.  Just to keep the food coming in. 
[02:32:00]  I think maybe it's time to call Eric out on the staff meetings.  Oh!  What?  We have these staff meetings every week where we have to say what's going on and what we're all working on.  I think probably for the last two months, every time it's Eric's turn, he just goes,  Well, working on August vacation.  I always scold Eric after meetings because I tell him that he needs to display leadership qualities and he needs people to respect him.  Because he goes to meetings and, first of all, over at the other place, when we were at CBS, he would sit on the floor during meetings. 
[02:32:30]  If all the seats were taken, he would sit Indian style on the floor at a professional meeting.  Let me add this in.  You ever watch Spider-Man?  Oh, yeah.  You ever see Peter Parker?  He doesn't quite handle himself very well.  He's that.  But behind the scenes, who is he?  Eric is not Spider-Man.  Who is he?  Spider-Man.  That's right.  Spider-Man's Spider-Man.  So Eric, throwing everyone up.  Clark Kent. 
[02:33:00]  What is he like when he's Clark Kent at the Daily Planet?  He's the biggest geek ever.  Exactly.  He's awkward.  He doesn't do things.  That's Eric.  But with selflessness, he is a hero that helps people and doesn't let it be known.  That's Arnagel.  No, no, no, no, no.  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  He is like Superman or Spider-Man.  Awkward in the meetings and stuff, saying,  stupid things.  Do you have a website dedicated to you?  E-Rock does. 
[02:33:30]  E-Rock!  It's mocking, though.  No, it doesn't.  I see E-Rock.com.  Able to eat an entire hero in three minutes.  In a single bite.  In a single bite.  In a single bite.  That's the lie, Dan.  Yes, of course it is.  I did a gotcha on that one.  In a single bite.  He slouches at meetings.  Heavier than a locomotive.  Able to leap over old people to get to the buffet?  I don't know.  I'm trying here.  Look, up in the sky, it's the Goodyear Blimp.  No, it's Nagel. 
[02:34:00]  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  I say we go home until E-Rock can properly...  Yes.  That sounds like an excuse.  Here in the Fortress of Hunger, dude.  Without E-Rock, why are we even here?  I know.  For real, Dan.  Let's go home.  He puts the collar of his t-shirts up over his nose in meetings with bosses and slouches  and bites the inside of his shirt.  If someone sees what's under that shirt, it's his superhero uniform.  It's breasts!  So he pulls it up. 
[02:34:30]  It's breasts!  Those are pectoral muscles, if you knew the difference.  E-Rock!  E-Rock!  Danny says, he's Clark Camp!  Travis says, Peter Porker.  Yeah, that's more like it.  We can't let him off the hook, totally.  He is fat, but he's a superhero.  And what kind of superhero takes off every Friday for the foreseeable future? 
[02:35:00]  Well, wait a minute.  He got Fridays?  Did he take Fridays?  Hey, wait a minute!  Anyone have dibs on Thursdays?  I thought we totally said no to that.  No, I need dibs on Thursdays.  Motherfucker!  Nagel's the man who can.  He's not the man.  He's correct.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  We got Bobby Lee standing by.  Yeah, I know.  Poor Bobby's been out there for a while.  Why does Stalker Patty stop by?  I don't know.  She's worried about all the attention Bobo's getting. 
[02:35:30]  She asked me a few weeks ago if she could come up.  Can I stop?  Has she been in the studio yet?  I don't think so.  Oh, it's so smooth.  The other show.  Huh?  The other show.  Oh, yes.  Or an F.  Yes.  Yeah.  Bobby Lee is very paranoid out there.  Why?  Because he said every time he comes here, the craziest shit in his life happens.  In his life?  Yesterday was the craziest shit he'd ever seen, and now Stalker Patty is walking around.  He has no idea what's happening. 
[02:36:00]  He just doesn't know why she's there.  What fucked up thing can we do with Stalker Patty in front of Bobby Lee?  I know I'm not the only one thinking that.  Yeah, I know.  True.  That's what goes down.  Do we have another vibrator laying around?  Because she was good with that in her pants going.  We could find something.  We have a fridge full of Stalker Patty.  Can we beat her with sticks?  Beat her with sticks.  That would be nice.  Oh, look.  She's got a little gift bag and everything.  Wonderful.  Maybe we could see what...  She says she's got a belated birthday present for me.  She probably does. 
[02:36:30]  I was...  What?  Oh, B, I knew you did, but I couldn't make it so...  Oh, she's got her O&A All The Way shirt on, and...  Yeah, all right.  You don't have to turn around.  Wow.  Hello.  I just came to say hi.  That's it, huh?  You know we're broadcasting, right?  You know this is a radio show.  I don't even allow my family to just stop by and say hi.  If Nagel was here...  We're entertaining the masses without E-Rock, which makes it really tough, by the way.  It's not.  It runs the show. 
[02:37:00]  It's not.  We found out today.  No impact.  No impact.  We owe him a giant apology.  And why all the mistakes today?  Because certain people are here...  10.30.  Amazing.  10.30, Sam.  People who are here are making mistakes.  It doesn't have to do...  They're not supervised.  Someone has to take the fall for this.  Yeah, supervisor.  Get it?  Super.  Super.  That's what he is.  Visor.  Super-sizer.  Sam, 10.30, all right?  Someone's got to take the fall for this.  Not bad.  We're going to miss you, but it's all right.  I've done such good work today. 
[02:37:30]  What?  I've done good work today.  Just fire yourself.  I don't want to, though.  I do good work.  I'm preparing a Sandy Kane in your...  Patty, can you leave the studio?  You make me very uncomfortable.  You bought a present, though?  No.  What'd you bring?  No, just a couple of stupid magazines I thought you might enjoy.  All right.  Barely legal.  And what?  How about we do it after the break?  Sure.  All right.  She's got magazines for... 
[02:38:00]  Leave the studio.  Don't show Anthony.  Yeah, don't show me yet.  We've got to save this for the air.  Yeah.  How long have you been doing radio with us?  She didn't even answer it.  What can we do now?  People's voices these days.  Meh.  I know it's going to be tough to come up with a Stucker Patty bit without E-Rock here.  Yeah.  Let's try.  E-Rock doesn't come up with bits.  Let's just try as a team.  Moose Wayne.  Moose Wayne.  Moose Wayne.  What the fuck?  The mild-mannered... 
[02:38:30]  That's a stretch.  Come on.  That's kind of a...  Moose Wayne is funny.  I still love your Clark Kent, but Moose Wayne.  Clark Kent and Moose Wayne.  Oh, we could do this.  One little letter change.  Yeah.  Who wasn't thinking of that?  We could give away wrestling tickets in E-Rock's honor.  Oh, that's your brilliance that you bring to the table today?  That's pretty good.  E-Rock, thank you, Danny.  Danny was just saying, good idea.  Wow.  That's so odd.  What made you think of wrestling?  Because you never...  Well, E-Rock likes wrestling, too. 
[02:39:00]  It's just his cover.  Don't you understand?  He acts like that to throw everyone off the hook that he's actually the guy running this show.  He wants to get along with the peons like yourself.  I'm not a peon.  So he goes, wow, one of my guys likes wrestling.  All right, I'll like wrestling, too.  He sees what happens to people of alleged authority.  Right.  They get thrown under the proverbial bus.  Talking about Steve Steve.  He'd rather be the bus.  Sam, fire yourself.  I don't want to.  Go ahead.  Please.  It's time.  No.  For real. 
[02:39:30]  No.  For real.  Why would I?  I know we made it a bit last week, but for real, it's time.  I do good work.  I do a lot of work.  Fire yourself.  No.  Come on, you fire yourself.  I don't want to.  Danny, you want to see him go, too, right?  Sam?  Yeah.  More than life itself.  Why?  Why?  I don't understand this resentment.  Do you have anybody that supports you here?  For real.  Not the fake support that I give you.  Opie is truly the gas can.  Opie is a walking gas can. 
[02:40:00]  He sees a spark and just walks up to it and tips his head.  Wow.  Who really supports you here, Sam?  Well, here's the thing.  Obviously not Danny.  No, Danny does not.  He threw E-Rock under a bus, even though he's not here to defend himself.  Right, so E-Rock doesn't anymore.  That's nice.  Travis is probably going to stick with Danny.  Yeah.  I bet I would have had Steve until the beginning of this week.  I completely...  Yeah, you might have lost one there, huh?  Yeah.  Lost a vote.  I think...  It makes it... 
[02:40:30]  Intern David is gone, so...  Well, yeah, he was...  Oh, you were his hero.  And you know, if you're out of the picture, it makes it easier to have a relationship with  Side Piece.  What are you talking about?  Oh, no.  For me, too, bro.  That hot...  For who?  Hot girlfriend of yours.  Yeah.  I appreciate that compliment that you're giving her.  She's very cute.  Yeah, I think so, too.  In the words of Tracy Morgan, you better put a baby in her belly.  You know what she reminds me of?  Because we're swarming.  We're swarming around.  You know what she reminds me of?  Like, just about every girl I looked at on the porn sites I was looking at last night. 
[02:41:00]  It was like, she has that cute face and everything.  She's good looking, but she's not on any porn sites.  Very attractive, but I wasn't implying that, sir.  I never would.  That's disrespectful, and I would never do that.  I appreciate that.  But she has that cute face and very nice figure.  She does have a nice figure.  What does Danny...  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That was at a wedding.  What's she doing with you?  Is that my wedding?  I get angry when I see that.  That was last weekend.  I'm so mad.  That's last weekend? 
[02:41:30]  Yes.  She just gets better looking.  Are you doing the tango?  What's wrong with you in that picture?  Is that the tango?  It's a silly picture.  Just a silly pose.  Were you wearing your sport jacket with the anchors on the buttons?  I wasn't wearing a sports jacket.  It's easy to grin.  Are you wearing a Judge Smell's jacket?  I looked good at that wedding.  I think you wore that to fans, if I recall.  Did you?  Sam, give away your wrestling tickets.  Okay.  So we can be done with that dumb wrestling thing for a while.  Done with you.  Well, the good thing is, we have two tickets to Night of Champions. 
[02:42:00]  This Sunday night in Philadelphia.  Why are you cricketing?  It's an amazing pay-per-view with every single WWE championship on the line.  People can go.  If you can get to Philly, we're not.  Be more funny.  I'm trying to.  I can't.  If you can get to Philly.  This is going great.  I thought so, too.  Well.  No shit.  Okay.  We're not providing transportation.  So you have to get to Philly on your own.  I don't care.  I don't care.  You should care. 
[02:42:30]  It's tickets to see Night of Champions.  Triple H.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Ray Mysterio, Jeff Hardy, Ray Norton, and your favorite superstars battle for WWE gold.  Night of Champions is this Sunday night on pay-per-view.  July 26th, 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific.  It's only on pay-per-view.  But you can go see it live if you call the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll give you two tickets to Night of Champions.  You get to see it all.  It's at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia. 
[02:43:00]  I don't care.  One more time.  No.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Every WWE championship is going to be on the line.  Raw, SmackDown, PC.  I don't care.  I don't care.  They're all going to be there live in person, and you can see it.  You just got to dip down to Philly, go to the Wachovia Center.  All you have to do is call the Opie and Anthony show, 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[02:43:30]  We'll give you two free tickets.  Two free tickets to WWE Night of Champions this Sunday, July 26th, 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific.  It's one of the biggest pay-per-views of the year.  They put the tag team title on the line.  They put the world title, the WWE title, everything.  Oh, da-da-da-da.  So call now.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  Wow, we got to use that clip more often. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, da-da-da-da-da.  That thing is great all the way to the end.  What were you saying, Sam?  I was listening to Kimmy.  He's very funny.  Tickets to the pay-per-views of Sunday.  Asshole.  Call now and get them.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Asshole.  It's a very nice thing.  Oh, I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  I'm so scared.  Oh!  So, Sam, make your...  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  Make yourself available at 1030 today, please.  Meeting?  Yeah.  Yeah, Steve Blatter's office.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, cool.  Promotion?  Just you.  Promotion?  Oh, that's a laugh.  And just me.  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be...  And Danny Garth, the office.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't know why you need that.  Also, bring your ID that gets you into the building.  Oh, I have it just in case...  Yeah, yeah.  Just bring that to the office, too.  What?  In case Steve wants to go to lunch or something?  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If they want to change the title on it to, you know, for your promotion.  I like the way that sounds.  You're being made.  Hey!  Hey!  Okay! 
[02:45:00]  What about it all?  I'm being made!  Like that.  Yeah.  Travis, over here.  We go to break with this from Dave Chappelle.  So...  A burp?  No.  Bobby Lee next.  Stork of Patty.  And hopefully not Sam.  Why?  What?  You said not Sam.  Hopefully not me.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Wait, there's a note outside the studio.  What is that?  How are we supposed to read that?  Are you crazy? 
[02:45:30]  That's Fat Matt for you.  Fat Matt.  Fat Matt?  Come in.  Come in for a second.  He put a note against the window.  That's just going to be angry.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, look out.  We know what this guy's all about.  What's up?  What's the note?  Yeah, what's the note?  Steve told me to stand in front of the window and hold this note up.  But who could read that?  I don't know.  He just told me to...  You're fucking 20 feet away through a window and it's written in like light pen.  Ballpoint pen.  Ballpoint pen.  In a sharpie around or something?  Ballpoint roller pen.  Steve just scrolled it and handed it to me. 
[02:46:00]  He said, here, hold this up.  It's the thinnest pen that they sell.  Fine point.  If E-Rock was here, he would have used a big fat fucking sharpie to make that note.  Well, I can't control everything.  I'm in the studio.  Condiments.  Yeah, condiments.  You've written it in ketchup.  Hey, whatever.  We'd still be able to read the fucking note.  What does it say?  Not my fault.  Sam, I want to win those tickets.  Whoa.  What do you do for them?  Something embarrassing?  You know you can't. 
[02:46:30]  I know I can't.  So call the show.  I did.  The phone number was busy.  A lot of people want to win these.  What are you doing?  Is this your last pair of tickets?  We only got one pair.  Oh, well.  You know people associated with the pro show cannot win this.  I know.  Beat it.  So leave.  Okay.  So quit.  I'll leave.  Quit and then go to a pay phone.  That's a rough one.  And you can call.  Oh, well.  Matt.  Oh, boy.  I totally nailed him.  That was rough.  What?  All right.  We'll go to break with Dave Chappelle.  Hopefully Sam will be gone by the time we get back. 
[02:47:00]  See, he did it again.  He did what?  He just said, hopefully Sam will be gone.  I'm standing right here.  Well, because we're going to move on to other things.  That's all.  1030.  Steve Blatter's office.  Yeah.  All right.  I just ran down the hall.  Bobby Lee's having a complete panic attack.  He's playing Caroline's this weekend.  It's our show.  He wants to come in here.  Our show is giving him panic attacks.  Yeah.  He wants to come in and discuss that. 
[02:47:30]  And we have Stalker Patty here.  And we had a perfect game yesterday, huh?  Yeah.  How do you say his last name again, Danny?  Mark?  Burley.  Burley, right?  Okay.  Thanks, Travis.  Mark Burley had a perfect game.  Always on mic.  But this was a very special perfect game because one of his teammates, you know, saved it by grabbing a home run.  Yep.  Mark Burley was perfect. 
[02:48:00]  And he's got teammate Dwayne Wise to thank for it.  And Burley pitched the 18th perfect game in Major League history Thursday.  A 5-0 gem over Tampa Bay.  The 2-1 to Bartlett.  Swing shot the short.  Ramirez has it.  Throws.  Burley picks the perfect game.  His second no-hitter.  He no-hits the Tampa Bay Rays.  People going crazy here at the U.S.  But there would have been no celebration were it not for Wise earlier in the 9th. 
[02:48:30]  With the drama unfolding, he raced to the left center field fence, leapt above the 8-foot high wall, and took a home run away from Gabe Kapler.  Then almost lost the ball on the way down.  Everything was going quick.  You know, it was kind of like I caught the ball and hit the wall at the same time.  And I couldn't really feel it going to my glove.  So as I was following, you know, I saw it just easy, you know, slowly rolling out of my glove.  And that's when I stuck my left hand up there and caught it.  That indeed is a perfect game, by the way.  Yeah.  Not just because, you know, by definition, but also it was perfect because then you also got some excitement as the guy's trying to save the perfect game for the pitcher, making it a perfect game. 
[02:49:00]  A perfect game, indeed.  Amazing, right?  And then the guy catches the home run ball, and then he almost drops it on the way down.  It was just unbelievable.  Boy, that team did help him out, huh?  Oh, yeah.  It's like we're watching some of the highlights right now, and wow.  Because it's not like they weren't getting some pretty legit hits, you know? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Where's our perfect game pitcher today?  Oh, that's right.  He's not here.  Oh, Nagel?  Yeah, Nagel.  Where is the Nagel?  Danny can't even be part of the pit anymore.  Danny Snickers.  Snickers up the Nagel.  And then this.  Two outs later, Burley had finished off what was almost unthinkable.  Obviously, it means a lot, but I think it's another thing when you retire and sit back and, you know, you see how many perfect games have been thrown in the history and your name's in there.  I think that's when I sit back and kind of be surprised.  Burley threw 116 pitches and struck out six to add the perfecto to the no-hittery toss against Texas in April 2007. 
[02:50:00]  But this was much more special and earned Burley a call from the White Sox first fan.  Hello?  Yes.  Thank you, sir.  It was.  You surprised me by doing that.  It was the first perfect game since Randy Johnson tossed one in 2004, and Sox fans who went to the afternoon game were giddy with what they saw. 
[02:50:30]  It was like electric.  It was like electric.  It's electric.  I've never seen anything like it before in my life.  Unbelievable.  Not only did the fans get to see the masterpiece, the win moved the White Sox within a percentage point of Detroit for first in the American League Central.  There you go.  Wow.  Yeah.  That is a perfect game.  I like it.  Just watching these clips, it's just amazing.  They're going through everybody that kind of got a potential hit.  Yeah, there's a few of those that should have been hits, right?  Man.  A couple of them anyway?  Yeah.  He probably would say he didn't have his best stuff, that his team really helped him out. 
[02:51:00]  From what I'm seeing here, it's like they did a great job.  Hell yeah.  Of backing him up.  The only problem I have with the story is the guy calling it a perfecto.  A perfecto.  Steven S. from Bayshore probably just wrote the grossest thing ever.  You read it too?  No.  I'm going to go look now.  Naked E-Rock?  Steven S. writes, that's pretty good.  Heyo, please make sure you adjust the mic so we can't hear Patty's yeast infection fizzing away the whole show. 
[02:51:30]  Like an Alka-Seltzer?  Oh, shit.  Hey, that is pretty funny.  And gross, though, man.  What the fuck?  You want to get Bobby Lee in here?  Sure.  Did he just run away?  Where did he go?  Did he run off?  No.  He's hiding over there.  Hiding in the corner by the window.  Wait, Sam first.  He wants to jump.  Can we play the final countdown every time Sam comes into the studio today?  Because it's kind of the final countdown.  We just want to make it special for you.  What?  So you can be added to the list of people that used to work here. 
[02:52:00]  What are you talking about?  People that will go like, oh, yeah, we'll keep in touch.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, you know.  Well, I don't even understand where this is coming from.  And then you can write your angry article.  Oh, my angry enemy.  Oh.  My whole life fell apart because I couldn't suckle off Opie and Anthony's tits anymore.  Fuck yourself.  Now, where are we?  Eighth inning?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We've been just watching this. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, broken bat.  Yeah, man.  Some of those should have.  I lined it to third.  I know.  Some of those should have been singles.  Who plays third for the White Sox?  He's freaking out.  One second.  Look at him.  I told him to just wait.  What happened, Sam?  What's going on?  I got some video that I'm posting right after the show.  Oh, it's going back and it's over the wall.  It's going.  Oh, no.  He caught it.  Oh, my God.  And then he bobbles it on the way down.  That is amazing.  Okay.  That's fucking amazing. 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  He had to get it out of his glove where it was falling and put it into his bare hand.  People are going to remember.  As he's falling.  Dude, he didn't grab that from his glove.  It came out of his glove.  He then grabbed it with his hand.  And people are going to remember that catch more than the actual perfect game.  Damn.  That catch is unbelievable.  Oh, in other sports news, we're going to get Bobby Lee in here in a second.  Roethlisberger responds to the rape allegations.  And, of course, he's going to be fighting that all the way to the end.  So there's a definite misunderstanding going on in that situation. 
[02:53:30]  Am I?  In this broadcaster's humble opinion.  This broadcaster.  I love when they say that.  This broadcaster wants to sell you.  Sam, what's going on with Bobby Lee?  He's freaking out.  Why?  Well, he's sitting on the floor outside right now, away from your eye shot.  He wants to go back and sit in the office.  He's been here for an hour and a half.  And he has said that yesterday was the craziest shit he's ever seen in his life. 
[02:54:00]  All right.  Well, I can't really deny it.  It wouldn't have been that crazy if he didn't decide to blow on some guy's dick.  He said you guys should have stopped him.  This is bad for his sobriety.  And that he said this is not.  He wants to do one segment here, plug his gigs, and leave.  This is not a fun show for him.  He said he has no fun on this show.  Holy shit.  Why?  Because we fuck with him every once in a while?  No, because he likes doing other shows like in Nebraska where he can control the room.  But here, he's just paranoid trying to make you guys laugh because he thinks maybe you might be funnier than him. 
[02:54:30]  No, he's very funny.  Well, but we are funnier than him.  But besides that.  Oh, my God.  Don't get them all.  We could have him control the show.  That would be great radio.  I like that.  What do you want to talk about?  Asian stereotypes?  Wow.  Bobby Lee needs a Xanax drip.  Bobby.  There he is.  Bobby Lee.  How you doing, Bobby?  Hi.  How was your night?  What?  How was your night?  Good?  You're a pisser, man. 
[02:55:00]  This endears you to our show.  Do you understand that?  No, no, no.  Can I say something?  Yeah.  No offense.  I think this is the last time.  This is the last time.  I mean, honestly, it's the last time.  You can't.  No, because I don't have fun.  I don't have fun.  It's supposed to be fun.  I don't have fun.  It really is.  It's supposed to be Sam's last day, not yours.  No, but can I just say something, though?  It's not.  Yeah.  All right.  It's my last day.  Yesterday, like, when I did that, it was fun, right?  No, it was not fun because you're – I'll tell you why it wasn't fun.  Because you're supposed to – you're friends with me, right?  Well, yeah.  You're supposed to stop me.  Not really.  We barely know you. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  We're supposed to stop you and go, no, Bobby.  But, dude, because I – you know, I thought I was bombing.  Then I go, I got to do something.  I spit on it.  Yeah, and then, like, you know, I'm a comedian.  And then I couldn't sleep last night because I knew I was going to do this show.  I can't live like that.  You know what I mean?  I can't live like that.  That's how I am every day.  I can't sleep because I got to do this fucking show.  How could you think that you were bombing, though?  I mean, the situation was you came in.  There was a guy that's kind of half-retarded naked with a hard on.  Yeah.  And you're supposed to tell your jokes?  But that's what I'm saying.  No, no, first of all, I don't – 
[02:56:00]  You're supposed to fire out some funny lines and maybe suck his dick a little bit.  I did a – no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  But what –  No, but do you understand?  Like, I've done radio before, right?  You go into certain markets, and I can walk into a room, and I control the room.  Right.  You know, I've been on television, whatever.  You know what I mean?  I come in here, you know what I mean?  I start shaking like a little leaf.  Like a leaf.  They're a bunch of hacks, though.  I get scared.  Those shows are hacks.  I know, but I come in here, it's like a whole thing.  I feel like there's a prank.  Trickery, like shadow play.  Trickery. 
[02:56:30]  You know what I mean?  Chicanery.  Shadow play.  Well, you know what I mean.  Love that song.  Yeah, like Joy Division.  Yeah, of course.  The original version is better than The Killers.  I understand what he's saying.  We've got to play Shadow Play by Joy Division when Bobby Lee runs out of here.  Anyway –  Wait, what is that based on, though?  We've been nothing but nice to you.  No, I know.  This is only your third time on the show.  It's a third or fourth time, but I want to say this, though, is that when you guys  go out there and you say hi to me, like you always come out and you go, hi, you shake 
[02:57:00]  my hand and stuff, you don't – I don't ever see you.  No, I don't leave the scene.  You're always in here.  I don't leave the chair.  But you're like, I like it.  Like I go, oh, I like Opie.  You know, I like Opie a lot.  He's a nice guy, right?  And I see Jim, I hug him, and, you know, when Geraldo and all – I like those guys,  you know?  Yeah.  But then when I actually come in here, I can't breathe, and my chest hurts, and I want  to go.  And I swear to God, like I'm going to leave right now.  It is not bad.  That's not bad.  You can't leave.  I'm like, can you plug my show?  I've got to sell tickets, man.  You can't leave.  Why?  Because –  You know what?  Here's another thing, though. 
[02:57:30]  Can I say another thing?  Can I say another thing?  You know why I know there's more trickery going on?  Who the hell is that lady?  That's Stalker Patty.  No, no, no.  I know.  I know.  But I asked who that –  No, no, no, no, no.  No, I asked who she was, and people were like, that's Stalker Patty, and she used to  live under a bridge, and I go, that's when it started.  I couldn't breathe.  No, she used to live at the radio station.  Yeah, I don't like it.  Under the stairs.  Yeah, I don't like it.  We're a stuffed rabbit.  There she is.  Oh, my God.  Stalker Patty, can you get naked for Bobby?  No, no, no, no.  I'll be, I'll be, I'll be.  Please.  I would like to spare him.  Yeah, hi.  I would like to spare him. 
[02:58:00]  Listen to how she talks.  It's very funny.  He's scared to death.  He's shaking.  She got little chiclet teeth.  Well, I'm a man.  I'm a man, you know.  I don't like this chemistry.  I want to talk to Bobby a little –  Get her out of here.  Why?  We'll get to her in a second.  Whatever it is.  What happened?  What happened right there?  We could just throw her out any time we want.  She'll just sit there, though.  No, don't feel bad about her.  Oh, okay.  What is that?  Trolly woman.  She's an old hooker, though.  She'll blow you for $10.  No, no, no.  I don't do that no more.  She's actually a 50 – how old is she now?  55 or something like that?  53, 4, somewhere around there.  She's a virgin.  She's not a virgin.  You want to smell her pussy? 
[02:58:30]  No, I don't want to smell it.  I don't want to see it.  You want to spit on it?  No, I don't want to spit on it.  I don't do any of that, Anthony.  So what was wrong with yesterday?  No, not –  All right, first of all –  Hold on.  The feedback we got on you was amazing.  People were like, holy shit, Bobby Lee.  Oh, you're a little loud?  Hold on, Bobby.  Back off on the mic.  You're fine.  It was a setting.  All right.  All right.  People said you were great on the show yesterday, and they're like, you've got to have this  guy back.  Yeah.  So you blew on a guy's dick.  Okay, can I just say –  I'll tell you what.  I'll tell you something, okay?  Yeah.  I go on Facebook last night in my hotel, right? 
[02:59:00]  And people in my private messages going, what are you doing?  You gay?  What's going on?  You know what I mean?  I don't need that in my life.  No, no.  I mean, I got problems.  You know what I mean?  That's a new problem.  It's all because of you guys.  Let me just say this.  Anthony, can I say something else?  That last year when I was here, and you guys played the rabbit prank –  What rabbit prank?  You know what rabbit prank and the earthquake and all that.  Don't deceive me.  I was there.  All right?  I don't know why you're laughing, dude.  I don't know why you're laughing, but let me just say something.  I could literally sleep for two weeks.  An earthquake prank.  It turned into a panic attack, and then later, it became anger. 
[02:59:30]  Wow.  And what are you doing, Aaron?  Nothing.  I don't do anything.  That's the problem.  Yeah, I just hold it inside me.  It turns into a boil or something.  He just bees angry.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's like what I'm saying to you is that today –  You get panicky, though?  Yeah, I'm panicking right now.  So I'm just going to keep talking.  You're quickly becoming my favorite person on earth.  This is what I'm saying right now.  I know.  I love this guy.  This is what I'm saying.  I'm going to plug my shows for the club.  Yeah.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  I'm going to say my goodbyes.  Lock the door, Sam.  And then it's going to be great.  And then next year, I'll come back.  And then let me see if I'm going to do it again.  Like, you'll forget over a year. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, I'll probably forget because I forgot about –  You're like an L.A. guy.  You're out west.  What do you mean?  What does that mean?  And they'll be like, oh, O&A?  Yeah, I'll do their show.  I did it.  I remember doing that.  We don't let L.A. guys in here for the most part.  Oh, thank you.  You're one of the rare exceptions.  I remember their show.  Yeah, I'll do it.  And then you come in and realize, oh, my God, it's that show.  Wait, we have a clip from the earthquake incident.  No, no, I don't want to see it.  It was the real earthquake that happened in New York.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  You did?  No.  Because I saw him on Kimmel.  That's why.  You best not fuck with Baa. 
[03:00:30]  He's turning –  You all right?  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  I started having a panic attack, man.  Why?  No, I started breathing.  I started sweating.  I got to get out.  Yeah.  Why are you panicking?  I had a breathing thing.  So we'll fucking deal with it.  Xanax or something?  What's wrong?  No, I just started getting like I was –  He's sweating.  He turned red.  They're not coming in.  They're fine.  He was freaking out because we weren't talking about him.  No, that's not what it was, man.  What was that?  All of a sudden, I don't know what was going on.  You want a Vicodin?  No, he's sober.  Dude, he's sweating really bad.  And he turned –  Your color came back. 
[03:01:00]  Well, you were a different color.  You were red.  I was picking out yellow again.  You might be better not being sober.  No, no, no, no.  Some people do better.  Oh, my God.  Don't say that.  Why do you say something like that?  Will you be my sponsor?  Be my sponsor.  Some people do better when they're drinking.  No, I don't –  Honestly, I literally gain weight and I carry a knife and I get really weird.  Oh, like Jimmy.  Yeah, like Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so I'm better sober.  And let me tell you something right now.  I'm only like this with you guys.  Really?  Yeah.  Every other time you're fine.  I'm totally fine. 
[03:01:30]  I control things.  That's a compliment.  Now you're like this.  You're talking very fast.  It's like –  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know why I do that here.  Well, I think it's probably the anxiety.  Yeah.  I've had anxiety attacks before.  So I'm going to play Caroline's.  You're not fun.  I'm playing Caroline's.  Yes, Caroline's.  Two shows tonight.  Bobby.  Two shows Saturday.  We just got some surprises for you.  Relax.  All right, all right.  We're going to get through this.  And where are you running off to?  There's nowhere to run off to.  I got to go to sleep.  Oh, that is nice.  You got the whole day to sleep.  All right.  That is a nice idea.  Why are you blocking the door?  I can get through you.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, Jesus.  I fucking thought Sam is going to walk the door.  Look at him. 
[03:02:00]  A twink.  The rock?  What is going on here?  I can do it.  A twink at the door.  Yeah.  You got a prostitute story for us that I just heard?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Tell him.  Well, which one do you want?  The one you just told me.  I don't want to talk because my fans don't know that I do stuff like that.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's like I have fans that are kids, and I can't tell them that I went to Tijuana  a bunch of times and did crazy things with wooden ladies, you know?  Really?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you be?  I'd be scared to go to another country, even though it's still, you know.  Oh, it's the best.  Let me tell you something.  If you're ever in Tijuana, you've got to go here, all right?  You've got to go to Adelita or Chicago Club.  Chicago Club.  They're adjacent from each other, right? 
[03:02:30]  But they're nowhere near Chicago.  I know they're not, but listen to me, okay?  Let me tell you something.  Adelita is where all the leaf blower Mexicans go.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All that stuff, right?  Right.  And the other one is where the white people go, like Marines and stuff, but they're both  fantastic.  Really?  Yes.  And the girls are good?  Oh, my God.  They fly from all over South America.  Oh, okay.  So you like Brazilians and stuff like that?  There's Asian ones.  It's incredible.  I don't know anymore because I'm on a spiritual path.  Yeah, of course.  I'm on a new path.  He gets panic attacks all the time, but you're willing to do that? 
[03:03:00]  I've done crazy things.  It's not that.  It's just that I come in here and I don't like it when people – I think there's tricks.  Yeah.  You know, that's all.  And the whole thing with a panic attack is it's randomness.  And it doesn't have to do with, you know, you're doing something crazy.  Right.  It's going to give you a panic attack.  Sometimes you just get it.  How about this?  Yeah, Opie.  How about this?  Yes.  We'll make a deal with you.  What?  You take a look at Stark and Patty naked, 53, 54, virgin, and then we'll let you go. 
[03:03:30]  We can do that.  Okay, but I'm not going to touch or anything like that.  He's thinking that – no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  But how much fun was yesterday for real?  It was weird.  We were laughing so fucking hard.  No, I was laughing at the time.  Was it weird?  I'll be the first to admit it was weird.  I felt weird all day yesterday.  You didn't spit on him like I did, man.  No, no, you did.  That was great.  Hey, I didn't raise my hand.  I woke up like – I woke up wondering if that had really happened.  Yeah, me too.  Like I was like, did that really happen?  Yeah.  And then I realized, yes, it did, and I felt very bad.  Well, that's never happened to me before, and I just – this show – 
[03:04:00]  That's weird.  They just closed the curtains.  It was good, but when you –  Why are they closing the curtains?  Bobby.  They just closed the curtains because if there's any sex going on, if there's any nudity in  here, they don't want people in the hallway seeing it.  Why?  Why did you do that?  Because if somebody walks by and sees nudity in the studio, they can have us fired.  Turn the lights down.  You all right with the lights down? 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Did someone turn the lights down?  Don't play – oh, my God.  You put the video up.  You want to see that?  No, no.  The video.  From yesterday.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  What bothered you about yesterday?  Because I walked into it.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It didn't just gradually unfold.  Right.  It was like –  You know something?  Yeah, you were –  It's like, Bobby, you're going to NOM, and then I'm just flown in there right  that day.  No, no, no, nothing. 
[03:05:00]  You know what I mean?  You weren't even in the military.  I need training.  I need training.  They just grabbed you off the street and sent you to Viet.  Straight to Vietnam.  Straight to Vietnam.  Here's a gun.  Good luck.  And I'm in a foxhole.  I don't like it.  Now, let me tell you something.  Yeah.  If this girl – if she touches me –  No, no, no.  No, no.  But, Anthony, if she touches me, I'm out.  And let me tell you something.  I agree.  You will never see me again.  You know something?  But I love you, and I love you.  And you guys are talented guys.  Thank you, Bobby.  Bobby.  Yeah, yeah.  So you're a very talented guy, and you're going to be at Caroline's.  Yeah.  When are you going to be at Caroline's?  Tonight.  Two shows.  Saturday, two shows. 
[03:05:30]  It's a Sunday, and I'm out.  Nice.  Hey, Bobby.  What a weekend.  We all know you from MADtv.  You held up that show for years, right?  Yeah.  For real.  Yeah, Opie.  What are you up to now?  I'm doing the road, man.  I'm asking a real question.  Yeah, literally, I'm doing the road, and I did it – you know, I'm just doing –  You're doing movies or anything else?  I have a couple lines in a movie in August, yeah.  Because your visual shit is hilarious.  They only give me two lines, these movies.  It needs to be – yeah.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Is it because I'm small and Asian?  I don't know, man.  What do you think it is, though?  I don't know, but when you were – they showed me a picture, a still picture yesterday  that I was laughing my bald off at.  It was you dressed up like – who is he dressed up? 
[03:06:00]  John McCain.  John McCain.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Dude, that was so fucking funny.  Yeah.  That was really good.  No, I'm saying –  No, I'm thinking, Anthony.  Really?  I appreciate it.  You know what?  There's one Asian guy in Hollywood getting all the work.  That is hysterical, man.  It's Ken.  Who is –  Ken Jeong.  Oh, yeah.  Is he the one that was in Hangover with the tiny, tiny –  Yeah, penis.  Minuscule dick with the big pubis hair area?  Him and I was going to fist fight.  Why?  I can't talk about it because it will blow up in my face.  This is a popular radio show.  So let's go.  Let's get this done for you.  Okay, let me just say something. 
[03:06:30]  Okay, this kid, right?  His name is Ken Jeong.  He looks like an old dude.  I know, but he's a good friend of mine.  He used to be a very good friend of mine.  Okay.  All right?  And I put him on 16 sketches at MADtv.  He was on MADtv?  Oh, like as my sidekick.  You know, when no one wanted the guy.  Okay.  Right?  He gets Apatow movies, this and that.  Then he starts – he got on my face in San Francisco saying like, you know what I mean?  You're coming back to beg for my friendship because I didn't talk to him for a while.  And he's like, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like he had a sense of like I'm the new guy now.  You know what I mean?  You're done and all that kind of stuff. 
[03:07:00]  And I'm like – and then Hollywood gave him every movie.  Like he's in The Goods coming up.  And I'm literally, you know, spitting on people's penises.  Oh, my God.  He was in Role Models.  He was in Role Models.  That guy, right?  Hangover.  Knocked Up.  Was he in Knocked Up?  Yeah, he played a doctor.  Knocked Up.  He's in The Goods.  Well, at least –  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  He's in everything.  But he's a talented guy.  I saw him in Tara, Tara, Tara.  Midway.  Yeah, yeah.  Bobby, that's your roles. 
[03:07:30]  That's got to piss you off.  No, I don't care.  I could see you in The Hangover role.  That would have been hilarious.  I know, Bobby, but I can't even get in the doors.  Why?  I don't know.  You're a funny motherfucker.  I have the biggest agency in town.  I have CAA.  I can't even get in the door.  I don't know him as well as I know you.  Yeah.  But my dumb knowledge, you're way funnier.  I know, but what can I do?  I mean, he does well.  No, he's a talented guy.  What he does in Hangover is hilarious, but it's a sight gag.  Yeah, yeah.  I got a small, tiny penis with a lot of fucking pubis hair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why they laugh, not because he's a funny guy. 
[03:08:00]  I know, but still, people don't know the difference.  Why not?  They see his penis, that's funny.  You know what I mean?  I'll show my penis, you know.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah.  Relax.  But my point is.  Relax about showing the penis.  I'm sorry.  We're getting along now.  I'm sorry.  We're getting along for the first time in three appearances.  But what's going on now?  I don't want to tell you.  All right.  But what's going on now?  I know what you just did, though.  What did I do?  That was really nice.  I set you up, right?  No, what you're doing is this.  You took my mind this way, and I'm like, oh, this is a regular thing.  Yeah, we're doing regular radio.  But then that's Deception.  Yeah, that's Deception.  And there's going to be a surprise. 
[03:08:30]  Right?  I know what it is.  I can't wait to play Shadowplay after this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Joy Division, though, right?  I love Joy Division.  Although the Killers did a good job with the song.  Yeah, yeah.  I like them, too.  You can turn up the lights a little bit.  Okay.  Turn it up a little bit.  You see all the shadowy people out there?  Yeah, yeah, it's shadowy.  Through the curtain?  Jesus.  It's shadowy.  All right, so the deal is, if you see Stalker Patty naked, then we could move on.  Okay.  Promote your gigs.  Okay, good.  Get you out of here.  Okay, good.  Unless you want to talk normal for a little longer.  No, no, no, that's fine.  We're doing great.  What other normal stuff do you want to talk about?  How long have you been sober? 
[03:09:00]  Six years.  Fuck, really?  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  No, there is no problem.  You know what I mean?  There is no problem.  You just want to make sure you continue down that path.  And what do you mean by spiritual?  What I mean by that is, I just want to be a good guy.  You know what I mean?  What do you mean?  Are you doing some religion?  You're doing some yoga?  Are you doing meditation?  No, I go to the AA meetings.  Okay.  And they have spiritual principles in it, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  So I just try to follow the thing.  I don't really believe in it, really.  No, no.  But I just do it just because I don't want to die. 
[03:09:30]  I guess a lot.  It's helping you out.  Yeah.  Anthony, I don't want to die.  No, who does?  No.  What was your poison?  A Vicodin, dude.  I was doing like 35 Vicodins a day, Brett Favre style.  Really?  Yeah.  What do you mean Brett Favre style?  He did a lot of Vicodin.  What did it do for you?  Do we know that for real?  Yeah, he did like 30 or 40 a day.  Really?  Documented?  Yeah, documented.  I have no idea.  What?  Documented.  Documented.  I say it as an Asian.  How?  Sometimes I do that, slip into it.  Documented.  Oh, real funny.  It's the one thing you want to get nervous.  I know, right? 
[03:10:00]  Russell Brand.  Do you mind stereotypical humor?  I'm fine with it.  Yeah.  Do you mind?  Like it was mostly on MADtv.  Well, no.  Some of it was.  I guess I was just trying to get his opinion.  I know.  I think I was just trying to get his opinion in general because like  in the radio world, you just, you can't do it on regular radio.  You get fired now, which is completely ridiculous.  Listen, dude, I'm very comfortable with who I am.  You know what I mean?  You know, I don't have a problem dating any kind of woman and I'm very confident.  So I don't, that race stuff doesn't bother me. 
[03:10:30]  They say you have a small penis.  I don't care.  Do you really though?  Yeah, I'm quick though.  You got that stereotype?  You know what I mean?  Like a rabbit.  You know what I mean?  And that's my talent.  You know what I mean?  Black guys, they lug it around like, you know, a big gun.  Me.  You know what I mean?  And they go, ooh.  Girls go, ooh.  So you can do just as much damage.  Yeah, damage.  Yeah, yeah.  Then the rat-a-tat-tat.  Then the boom, boom, boom.  You know, bang, bang.  Power hump.  That's what I call it.  I like to lock my shoulders in like this and go, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta like that.  You have to bring them down like that.  And white chicks, they don't even know what's up.  They go, oh my God, it's Eastern. 
[03:11:00]  You know what I mean?  It's from the Orient.  You get a lot of kama-sutra.  You get a lot of pokes at that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  It's great, man.  35 Vicodin, really.  Yeah.  Did you have like.  Dude, let me tell you something.  Did you have an incident that turned it around?  Yeah, can I tell you my last –  We love those stories.  Check this out.  Okay, this is what happened.  I was taking 35 a week, and then MADtv and Fox gave me an intervention, which is embarrassing.  It was Thursday night.  Executives.  I'm wearing a sweater.  I have boils on my face.  I'm shaking.  They're like, you're going to get fired from the show.  And they go, can you do one more live, and then we're going to send you to rehab. 
[03:11:30]  I go, okay.  So the Thursday before the live, which is Friday, right, I threw all my biking away.  I flushed it down the toilet.  I show up at work the next day, and I'm shaking.  Spiders are crawling out of my skin.  And I had to do a Connie Chung sketch in front of a live audience.  So they put makeup on me.  You know what I mean?  I'm sweating it off, right?  I have the dress on and everything.  I get in front of 500 people, right, TV cameras, right?  And I have my legs crossed, and the lights dim down.  They go, five, four, three, two, action. 
[03:12:00]  The lights turn on.  I see the audience, and I go, good evening.  And poop ran down my stocking.  No fucking way.  Yeah, then I hear cut.  And the producers, yeah, the producers came out, and they go, you're doing it!  And so the poor wardrobe is wiping the shit off my legs.  Aerie Spears is going, man, it smells like shit, my foe.  You know what I mean?  And literally, and when I left that sketch, I literally thought I would never see those  people again.  Well, I would have thought the same thing.  I thought I was done, but you know what happened?  I got sober, like, the next day was my last day. 
[03:12:30]  And I started going to meetings.  That is kind of hitting the bottom when you shit yourself.  On television.  On live television.  As Connie Chung.  Yeah, as dressed as a woman.  Wow.  So, yeah, it was my bottom.  Damn.  How'd you get so caught up in the Vicodin?  When I was younger.  Everyone blames an injury.  What?  Everyone blames an injury.  No, for me, it was like, it started with Valium, right?  And then it just progressed to Vicodin.  Why?  Because it just felt good.  It made me feel euphoric, you know what I mean?  I like euphoria.  Yeah, I like euphoria.  Euphoria is euphoric.  Yeah, it's nice.  It really is nice. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is very nice.  How come all the things that make you feel good are bad?  I don't understand that.  Yeah, but you know what?  What you don't understand, Anthony, is what you're doing now, it makes you feel good.  And it's not bad.  No, it is, but the waking up part sucks.  Yeah, that sucks.  Like, it's too early.  If I could do this at, like, nine at night, it would be great.  Perfect.  Yeah, but then they won't pay me as much.  Yeah.  Which sucks.  But what's great, there's a lot of stand-up sober, which I feel comfortable about.  I can't call them out.  Did you think your stand-up was going to suffer if you weren't on drugs? 
[03:13:30]  No, it's gotten better.  No, but beforehand, were you like, if I stopped doing it?  Dude, Pauly Shore, Jamie Masada in the L.A. clubs called me and said, you're banned from  the clubs.  Oh, really?  I thought I was out of the game.  You were that bad?  I was that bad.  And then, as I got sober, I got back into the clubs.  Were you shitting on the stage all over the country?  Yeah.  No, I was...  And now, let's join the Bobby Lee!  No, I got five comics addicted to Vicodin.  Really?  Because I would pass it out.  Yeah, I can't name who they are, but, like...  You don't want to be all fucked up alone.  They were real.  Well, name one. 
[03:14:00]  No, no, no.  But they were real...  No.  See, that's what I mean.  But they're real, like, entities, like, real big kind of people.  You know what I mean?  Really?  And I got them all fucked up.  They still got problems?  Just check this out.  No, you didn't do this book.  No, one of them does.  Yeah, he's about to die.  What can I do, though?  Oh, yeah, okay.  This is great.  About to die.  Comic about to die because of Bobby Lee.  Let me think.  No, no, no, no, no.  What?  Blind item.  Blind item.  Blind item.  Column.  So, anyway, is it now that we're done?  I thought we calmed you down.  I thought this was going well. 
[03:14:30]  I know.  Hold on.  We got someone that wants to help you relax.  For real.  Lydia.  Lydia Oceanside.  Oh, this friggin shrink.  Don't listen to her horrible voice.  She's smart.  Lydia.  Oh, hi, guys.  Such a timing.  I'm about to walk into a psychiatric hospital to see a patient.  Oh, really?  What do you got for Bobby to make him relax?  I wanted to say that if he's going to see Stalker Patty nude, I think he needs to start  with this subjective muscle relaxation right now.  How do you do that?  Do you know that?  What is it?  Yeah, he has to close his eyes and start with each body part. 
[03:15:00]  Start with his toes and just keep his eyes closed and breathe deeply until he can't feel  his toes anymore and then keep going up.  If I had time, I would walk him through it.  Well, I'll fall asleep if I do that.  It's not working.  It's not working.  It's not working.  It's not working.  Like, start with your toes and then all the way up to, like, top of your head pretty  much, you just relax every muscle and then breathe and you wind up falling asleep.  That's exactly right.  Or you could just listen to Lydia babble on and on and fall asleep, too. 
[03:15:30]  That's right.  I could bear you to death, too.  That's what I meant, Lydia.  Okay, sorry, guys.  All right, Lydia.  Thank you.  All right.  It's time for Stalker Patty.  Turn the lights on.  Wow.  She's changed.  Oh, that's an intern.  Stalker Patty's coming.  Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-e.  Yay.  Patty.  It's all right.  Now, could you get naked for Bobby?  No, why don't you move over there?  No, don't use Bobby's mic, you friggin' maniac.  I'll at least wow him, and it's not even Wednesday.  You know what Whip It Out Wednesday is?  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Whip Em.  I know.  Everyone said Whip It Out Wednesday. 
[03:16:00]  It's been a dummy.  It's too bad.  Yeah, but do you know what that is?  No, no, no.  Oh, it's the greatest radio promotion in the world.  You've never seen it?  Can you listen to that voice?  Can you do it, please?  Oh.  You've got to get completely naked.  Oh, not completely, but I'll wow him.  No, well, it's too bad it's going to be your last appearance on the show.  Right, Sam?  That's right.  That's right.  What do you want me to do?  Oh, there's the line.  Wow.  That's one of your catchphrases from the song.  What do you want me to do?  Hold on.  Take the shorts off first. 
[03:16:30]  It's all right, Bob.  Don't worry.  She doesn't have a dick.  We'll get through this.  And it's going to be great.  She should have a dick, but...  No, I don't.  Patty, how old are you?  54.  And she wears all our merchandise.  Isn't that great?  The O&A panties.  She comes here to shop.  This is like fucking Armani for her.  All the t-shirts and...  How old are you?  54, he said?  Yes.  And you're still a virgin?  Yes, I am.  Are you closer to having sex with anyone?  Well, I joined plentyoffish.com, and I met about... 
[03:17:00]  I've slipped out of it.  All right.  I got about 50 matches so far.  Plentyoffish.com.  What's wrong with that?  It's a free site.  It's a free site.  It's a great website.  I love it.  Get me to plentyoffish.com.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go there.  That's in plentyoffish.  I'm on plentyoffish.  You are.  You are.  It isn't.  It's for fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got 50 matches, I'll have you know, and I might even have more.  Wow.  Did you connect with any of these matches? 
[03:17:30]  Well, I want to write letters to about three of them that I saw that interested me.  There are probably 49 of them from prison.  Oh, my God.  No.  Please tell me...  Please, even just let Danny know.  I need to know who's interested in you, and I got to see...  I know.  I want to see what they wrote.  Also, on the website, I got my password.  My password.  I got my password.  Yeah, let me put my shorts back on, go out there, get my book with my passwords in it.  Chiclet teeth looking for the same. 
[03:18:00]  Dude, just take your old school wrestling shorts and walk out.  I need to get the password.  I don't have my password memorized.  What's going on?  She looks like Bruno San Martino when she takes her shorts.  Things change, Bobby.  What happened?  What happened?  I know.  She was supposed to.  I thought you were going to do it.  But then she all of a sudden got us onto this plentyoffish.com, but now we've got to  know more about this before the show ends.  Go get your stupid password.  Go get your stupid password.  Sign up.  Okay, but...  Because we want to see your matches now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bobby, we're doing okay.  No, I'm going to turn this thing around.  The weird thing about this show is there's no set track. 
[03:18:30]  No, not at all.  Yeah, I get that.  I get that, Anthony.  It's very free form.  Yeah, I get that.  We're all over the place.  What do you like about...  Some people would call it disorganized.  Why do you like other radio out there?  This is the only radio?  This is the best radio.  This is the only radio.  It's the only one, but let me tell you something, right?  It was about control is what I'm saying.  You like the guys that come in and go, hey, it's Bobby Lee, everybody.  You know him from Mad TV.  He's going to be playing the Carolines all week and long.  Bobby, what's going on?  Yeah, because I don't respect them, so I just go in and roll them over.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh, yeah.  And they just sit there and do that, and you roll.  Make a promise to us right now you're not going to do anybody else's show. 
[03:19:00]  Why?  Well, that's crazy, man.  Why?  That's stupid.  I'm going to do it.  Jesus Christ.  Why would you even say something like that?  I'm going to do it.  Good luck next time you're on this show.  He does things like this all the time, and it embarrasses me.  I know.  That's why I do it.  What are you doing?  She's putting a coat down.  That's my name on it.  Oh, good.  Great.  I can only imagine what you're...  All right, start getting naked while we find your password.  Yeah, go ahead.  Show Bobby the goods.  I want to see the goods. 
[03:19:30]  Take off your pants, all right?  Hey, lady.  Okay.  Dice.  All right.  Everyone knows who I was going to get.  Are you a fan of Bobby Lee, by the way?  What?  Are you a fan of Bobby Lee?  I've never heard of him.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  You never watch MAD TV?  It's okay.  You never watch MAD TV?  No, I don't.  What's wrong with you?  It's okay.  Do you have a TV?  I do.  What do you watch?  Oh, God.  Lifetime channel, history channel.  We saw that already. 
[03:20:00]  What is this?  He's not on Lifetime channel.  No, we're going further, Bobby.  Okay.  There will be digits going in her vagina by the end of this.  Oh.  What?  Patty.  Oh, Danny.  Sorry.  You don't even have a picture up here, Patty?  Oh, I don't.  That's why you got so many.  You got so many.  Oh, there you go.  No, there it is.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  What are you doing there, Patty?  Oh, that's me and my cat.  Crazy cat lady.  Yeah, crazy cat lady.  Looking for a man that does not like sex.  What does she say? 
[03:20:30]  Dan, what can you find so far?  Her sign is Gemini.  She says she's 5'3".  Her age is 54.  She put her height in centimeters.  Well, that's for the European unclipped cock.  I like that, too.  It says, I'm a fan of Opie and Anthony.  Yes, we're on there.  Good, good.  All about me.  I'm a fan of the Opie and Anthony and the Ron and Fez show on XM Sirius Radio.  I work as a barrister at Starbucks.  I love the Beatles, especially John Lennon's work. 
[03:21:00]  Enjoy concerts, visiting museums, and I'm a real music fan.  I can sing and have a good voice.  I like long walks.  You didn't put that.  Long walks, love Central Park, and I'm an animal lover.  You put animal lover there.  You do understand that.  Yeah, I know I did.  Is that funny?  That's supposed to show you a sense of humor?  Yeah.  I'm a sincere person, quiet but not shy, and just wants to get to know more people and make new friends. 
[03:21:30]  First date.  A quiet dinner in a fun restaurant where we can talk, and I love seafood.  Bubba Gump.  Bubba Gump is an idea for a first date.  I also like music, and can fancy a really cool concert.  Recently saw Fleetwood Mac, and I loved it.  Afterward, a leisurely walk through Central Park where a Negro could bash us on the head with a single block. 
[03:22:00]  I enjoy a good wild thing.  Just something simple.  For the old scores.  That's what they're getting when they date you, just something simple.  You know what?  When she's new, maybe she could sing a little Fleetwood Mac for Bobby Lee.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Landslide.  Landslide, please.  You know how to sing Landslide?  I don't know.  I would have to hear the song.  You know, I just know a couple of their songs.  What song do you know?  What song do you know?  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,  Stand back, stand back, stand back.  That's Stevie Nicks.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Go back where you are.  She's in Fleetwood Mac.  Oh, I know that.  That's fine.  Dude, here's a, she's seeking a man for dating.  Do you drink?  She says, no, you're a liar.  I've seen you drink and get fucking drunk.  Oh, shit.  At bar nine?  You never drank at bar nine?  No, I have never.  You didn't drink at the, uh, at the St. Paddy's Day thing? 
[03:23:00]  I just had a little, like, Zinfandel, but that's not drinking.  You drank yesterday's.  I only had one.  You couldn't write better shit than this.  No, this is incredible.  I mean, a little wine doesn't make you a drinker.  You couldn't put occasionally there?  You couldn't put occasionally or very light drinker or social drinker?  Well, because I really don't.  All right, well, okay.  I hate beer.  I hate beer.  Go back up.  Uh, all right.  Uh, smarts, uh, which I guess is schooling.  Uh, some college?  Yeah.  What does that mean? 
[03:23:30]  It means I, uh, attended.  Community?  No.  I thought you said you had a degree.  Wagner College.  Oh, Wagner, okay.  Did you say you had a degree?  BA speech in theater is a real degree?  With a minor in music.  Here's my favorite.  A little education.  All right, guys, shut up.  Here's my favorite.  Do you want children?  She puts prefer not to say.  How about you have no say?  Your womb preferred to say no years ago.  The factory's closed.  Yes, exactly.  Shut down like a Detroit auto company. 
[03:24:00]  That's done.  What do you mean prefer not to say?  Why did you put that?  Well, if I were to meet somebody later on and they had kids, I wouldn't mind them, you  know?  It'd be awesome, you know?  What do you mean by later on?  At the funeral home?  Later on?  You don't have a later on.  Yeah, there's not much later on.  There's a point in your life where you realize, I don't have a later on.  It's now or never.  In 54, I probably have about 50 years left. 
[03:24:30]  50 years?  50 years what?  You're 104 years old, you're going to be.  Yeah, you don't live in Okinawa.  What the fuck do you think?  Well, let me tell you something.  People are living longer.  What, do you eat yogurt?  You are delusional.  Yeah, she's in Soviet Georgia.  I eat a lot of healthy things.  I don't eat junk.  But Patty, your body isn't going to look like anything at 104.  Yeah, what do you think?  So what?  What do you think your quality of life will be?  I'll age gracefully.  Who the fuck's going to want to have sex with a wrinkly old stalker patty?  Oh, boy.  Use that body now. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, do it now.  Yeah.  I'd use that.  You should do it now.  As in right now, Bobby.  Yeah, yeah.  I have to see it.  Bobby, pull your pants down right now.  Right now.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wait.  Did we get any pro responses yet?  I want to see what these guys are saying back to now.  All right.  No, I'm just.  This is just her profile.  So if she wanted to, like, she'd have to log in.  Log in, Patty.  All right.  Get naked and then you can log in.  Yeah.  Yeah, get naked first.  Log in naked.  Get naked.  Why?  Yeah.  Bobby wants to see.  Bobby log.  Oh. 
[03:25:30]  It's nice.  It's only a show, okay?  It's nice.  It's only a show.  It's really nothing.  I'm not really like this.  It's okay.  It's so easy to get her naked.  It's so good.  I remember the days it took for a long time to get her naked.  She should absolutely be following Reese's pieces through the woods.  What is that?  What?  The stomach.  There's a knife wound?  Yeah, what's that?  Yeah, what is that?  It's appendicitis when I was eight.  Oh, okay.  They take it out with a spade shovel?  I don't remember.  I was under the ether.  Well, ether?  What hospital did you go to the ether?  Okay, this is... 
[03:26:00]  I was eight years old in 63.  They used ether.  They put leeches up.  They did not use ether.  Yes, they did in 1963.  Yes.  Holy shit.  You watched too much Bugs Bunny.  They didn't use ether.  They had anesthesiologists.  Does Matt like stalker party topless?  That would administer an anesthesia.  Ether is a...  You're a maniac.  All right.  Let me log in.  I want to give you ether now.  Let's get...  Hey, Matt.  This isn't naked.  Do you like...  You like patty?  Naked?  That's partially nude.  No, not really.  That is how they should find your body.  Partially nude in a shallow grave. 
[03:26:30]  Alien autopsy.  Yeah, exactly.  Every time.  It's been said a million times.  The breasts are okay.  Huh?  The breasts are okay.  Yeah, they could be a lot worse.  Yeah, they could be a lot worse.  I would have to give her above average for her age.  Yeah, yeah.  I was expecting, like, you know, beef jerky or something.  I take care of myself.  Well, how do you take care of your breasts?  You eat right.  I'm not that.  What do you eat for your tits?  What's good tit food?  You eat vegetables and lots of them and fruit. 
[03:27:00]  Call back.  Ugh.  I must be...  Oh, Eric.  Just call up Iraq and see what he eats.  Ah, good Danny.  Come on, Patty.  You can't keep the boobs in shape.  They're either going to fall or they're not going to fall.  It's gravity.  You've got a little, you know...  What do you do, a handstand every other day?  You walk on your hands?  No.  It's just that I happen to be very lucky, I guess.  I don't know.  No, slow down.  Patty, at 23, when you were 23, you must have been attractive, kind of, right? 
[03:27:30]  Why wouldn't you have sex then?  Because I was in with this religious group and they messed me up.  At least she's admitting it, finally.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're trying to get her out there, believe it or not, Bobby, and enjoy her life as a human  being, but so far, we're getting her closer.  Well, there's one way of doing it.  I hope to meet somebody there.  Yeah, pop your friggin' password in there, because I want to see who these guys are that  are responding.  God, they've got to be gems.  Oh, my God.  I bet they are just...  I'm going to pass on the vagina, I think. 
[03:28:00]  Are you?  What's wrong, Bobby?  I'm just going to pass on it.  I don't know.  I just want to.  I just want to.  I don't think this is a game show, Bobby.  I can't pass on it?  I don't think this is a game show where we can pass.  It's not Family Feud?  It's not Family Feud?  I can't go pass.  Bobby, let's walk you through this.  You rang the buzzer the second the door opened, and now you've got to play.  No, because if I look at her vagina, it's like abalone.  I can't do it.  You know what I mean?  It's like abalone?  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, right.  You know, it sticks out.  Yeah, I don't like that.  I don't think so.  I think from what I've seen...  But if she's a virgin, it's probably a slit, right?  Yeah, I think there's a slit there.  Don't you hate that exploded fucking steak? 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, I'll break up with a girl.  It is really horrible.  It's too meaty for me.  You don't need that.  Jimmy Norton loves that.  Yeah, I don't like it.  It's terrible.  But what is this going to lead to, Bobby, if you see her vagina?  I don't get it.  Well, I don't know, man.  Like when you chew a full pack of Hubba Bubba.  Yeah, but if it's like...  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.  Asian girl's vaginas I don't like.  No, what's wrong with him?  Well, the lips are purple.  Are they?  Yeah, they're dark purple.  I've seen that.  For real?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Well, my sack is purple.  I think Indian women have dark lips.  I don't know.  I think ethnic people have just purples in the sacks. 
[03:29:00]  Purple sack.  You know, and imagine if they used to call me black sack.  I swear to God.  Because my sack is black.  You want to see it?  No, that's okay.  Sam, you want to see his sack?  I do.  All right.  All right, Sam does.  Sam will take a look at Bobby Lee's sack.  Sam, not.  Is it purple?  It's got to see its little...  Oh, you just turned around and got to see this, Sam.  I thought that was your underwear for a second.  I thought you were wearing brown...  Why is it so dark?  I thought you were wearing, like, brown underwear. 
[03:29:30]  Why the fuck is it so dark, Bobby Lee?  I'm playing Caroline's all weekend long because it's still on sale.  Well, they call me black sack.  Black sack.  I swear, I thought you were pulling your underwear, and I was like, why isn't he pulling his bag  out?  He's got, like, brown underwear on.  Okay, can I just say something about ethnic women, people?  Yeah.  I think people have dark genitalia.  Yeah.  And, like, the calamari, the anus, right, is usually dark, too.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's okay.  Well, people like that, I guess.  Patty?  Patty, go ahead.  Do the vagina thing real quick, because I can't...  The suspense is killing me.  Yeah.  You just have to do it, and then I have to... 
[03:30:00]  You just have to put them down, so you've got to pull your...  Yeah, you've got to do it now.  You've got to do it now.  You've got to help them out.  And then bend over and spread your cheeks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pull them down.  Pull them down.  No, no, go ahead.  Patty, what's the...  Patty, Patty, pull it down.  Pull it down.  Pull them down there.  Pull them all the way down.  Let me see.  I've got a comment.  Pull them down.  Pull them down.  Patty, Patty, Patty.  Pull them down.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Patty, when was the last time you shaved?  It's like a Cambodian jungle.  Keep it down.  It's a Cambodian jungle.  A month ago.  A month ago, you shaved?  What happened?  I thought you were keeping it nice and clean.  You were shaving?  Patty, keep it down.  Keep it down.  Remember you were shaving? 
[03:30:30]  What happened?  I just got lazy.  Keep it down.  Okay.  You got lazy.  I'll see you.  Look how many gray pubes you have.  I'll see you.  Your pubes are all gray.  Bobby, sit the fuck down.  No, no.  I'll see you the next time.  Bobby.  I'm scared.  I've got to get the fuck out of here, man.  It's enough.  What's the problem with that?  Enough, enough.  For real.  I need to get into your head a little bit.  Her body's like Gollum.  I don't like it.  You know what I mean?  It's a whole thing.  It's like Middle Earth.  I don't like it.  Yeah, it really is.  It's otherworldly.  It's otherworldly.  You want to see her anus? 
[03:31:00]  Yes.  No.  Just bend over.  I want to see her anus.  I'm here, Patty.  Oh, sorry.  That's okay.  It's okay.  I was on television for eight years.  Give me a break.  Look at her anus.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, Patty.  Turn around.  Late night television.  Bend over, bend over.  Spread your cheeks.  Spread.  Spread your cheeks.  Spread your cheeks.  Spread off.  What is it looking like?  Moisture.  I saw moisture.  Anal moisture?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway, thanks.  Bobby Lee.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There goes Bobby Lee. 
[03:31:30]  Caroline's all weekend.  Two shows tonight.  You're really leaving us this way.  Oh, my God.  He feels like he can't get out.  I need to get out.  Wait a minute.  You got to get out.  Bobby, get out.  You're freaking him out.  How is that locked?  It can't be.  That doesn't lock from in here.  Bobby.  Get open the door, man.  He's freaking out.  Bobby's freaking out.  He got open the door.  Holy shit.  And now he's gone.  That's it.  He just fucking ran out. 
[03:32:00]  I fucking love this guy.  Oh, Patty, it's not about you.  Put your stupid clothes on.  Yeah, put your clothes on.  Who gives a shit if you're naked?  But now, I want to punch up some of these guys that she wants to see.  He is fucking hysterical.  I love him.  He's like one of my favorite guests.  I don't know if he'll ever be back, but I love Bobby Lee.  He was one of my favorite guests to have on this show now.  Facebook the shit out of Bobby Lee and say, please go back on the Opie and Anthony show.  He's so fucking weird.  And it's just funny to watch him freaking out like that. 
[03:32:30]  I got to get out of here.  Do you want to see her anus?  Yes.  Yes.  I have to now.  I have to.  He turned like this.  This is mine.  You want to see my sack?  He knew the whole time he wanted to, but he was trying to get out before he actually  saw it.  Yeah, yeah.  Before he had to.  And then he couldn't help himself anymore, and he had to see the anus, and then that was  it.  Wow.  Everyone's saying on instant feedback, Bobby Lee fucking rolls.  He's great.  Oh, my God.  He's fucking hysterical, man.  All right, Patty, punch up some guys.  What are we looking at?  Yeah.  Who?  Because we got to get the fuck out of here.  We got a meeting.  Because we're like, I don't want to say we're like your older brothers, because that's weird. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  Because you're way older than us, but.  Oh, Whoopi, age 55.  Who?  Who?  Whoopi, that's what he calls himself.  He calls himself, oh, God, this guy's got to look like a pedo that runs a softball league.  This guy's so married.  Yeah.  Jesus.  But he says he's single.  Let's see.  What does he do?  He's single, Capricorn, smoker, no.  Body type, a few extra pounds.  He's Jewish, and.  Doesn't look Jewish.  He was married.  He's divorced.  Oh, he's divorced, of course. 
[03:33:30]  He's an educator.  Does not want children.  All the kids are over 18.  So he's got grown kids.  Does he drink socially?  He's a raging alcoholic.  What a great sight, because one of the questions is, do you have a car?  Do you have a car?  Yes.  What do you think, Patty?  You go out with him?  I go for a date with him.  You give people the benefit of a doubt.  You know, you just.  But down, whatever.  It's for getting networking and getting to know people.  Shut up.  That's what it's all about. 
[03:34:00]  Go to another guy.  Patty, I think you have nice eyes.  After all these years, I think I just noticed your eyes.  Why don't you wear contacts?  Nah.  I've never been into that.  I prefer glasses.  There's nothing in her body.  She puts nothing in her body.  Her eyes are pussy.  Anything.  What?  You got to squint a little.  All right.  Hold on.  And only look.  Like, go like this with your hands.  Open your eyes, Patty.  From like.  Yeah.  No.  It might be the glasses making them bigger, dude.  Take your glasses off, Patty.  The nose sucks.  The teeth suck.  But the eyes are.  Well, not when you look like a psychopath. 
[03:34:30]  Christ.  Jesus.  She's making fucking.  Look, normally, I'm trying to give you a compliment.  I think you have nice eyes.  Making Shelley Duvall eyes.  Yeah, really.  Patty's got nice eyes.  Let me see.  Go ahead.  Look at me, dummy.  Now move your hair out of the way.  God, what's wrong with you?  Ugh.  No, I'm not seeing it.  Because you're looking below the eyes.  I know.  It's hard to get the whole picture.  Maybe if I gouge him out and look at him just sitting on the shelf.  All right.  So what else about this guy?  Oh.  All right.  He's just basic.  Whatever.  Now we've got a 60-year-old. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, let's see this guy.  What is he, 60?  Okay.  He's an Aquarius, and he's 6'3".  He's 60 years old.  He's a Caucasian with brown hair.  You know that's all hair dye, by the way.  Smoker, no.  He's got a few extra pounds on him.  Does he drink?  Doesn't say.  Uh-oh.  It says socially.  That's a problem.  Oh, it said socially?  Oh, right there.  Do you?  He socially drinks.  He's divorced, too.  What's this visiting family in Bayshore thing?  I can't read it.  Now visiting family in Bayshore or Long Island, I always respond out of courtesy to whoever 
[03:35:30]  messages me.  This guy's looking to get laid.  He's just looking for some nookie, Paddy.  This guy's just looking for you.  This guy's a player.  Yeah, he's just playing.  Yeah.  What is he wearing?  An American flag shirt jacket?  The fuck is that?  He's like a maritime guy.  Oh, oh.  It's a sailor.  Oh, he likes yachting.  That's good.  He could always dump the body in the middle of the ocean.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Find someone else.  Oh, hey.  This guy looks smooth. 
[03:36:00]  What the fuck?  Boy, you really...  Did you put in an age bracket that you're looking for?  Yeah.  What was it?  Over the age of 35 and under the age of 60.  So between 35 and 60?  Yeah.  You don't want no 20-year-old banging you in the ass?  No.  No.  No.  They're like little babies to me, you know?  Well, why would you just go for the young cock there, Pat?  Yeah.  No, because I think it's kind of sick.  You should be with people your own age around there.  Don't fuck yourself.  No.  I'm too embarrassed.  I would never...  No. 
[03:36:30]  I'm not going to be a sheriff looking for a toy boy.  You just want to make friends with people.  Oh, really?  Besides, what could I have in common with a 20-year-old as far as interest?  His cock in your ass.  No.  I'm looking more for like interest and similarities.  These guys all look like pedophiles, by the way.  Every single one of these guys look like they...  It's a mugshot for pedophilia charges.  Look at that.  Non-religious athletic body type.  This guy is 49 years old. 
[03:37:00]  Wow, a chippy.  Let's see.  He drinks socially.  They all do.  He's divorced also.  He's a dentist.  So he might be able to fix you a little chiclet teeth.  He doesn't want children.  He does not do drugs.  He has children.  And he has a car.  And a car says N-A.  Non-applicable.  What does that mean?  Maybe he lives in the city or something?  Yeah.  You don't need to drive in the city.  Patty. 
[03:37:30]  One more.  And what was this wild man with a boat?  That's the same guy.  Oh, that's the same guy?  He's cute.  It looks like Abil.  You think he's really cute?  It's Abil.  Abil.  Hey, Patty.  Hey, Patty.  I'm going to fuck in your hiney.  Maybe too inside, but...  Abil.  Who's this guy?  All right.  Another social drinker.  Divorced.  I'm retired.  I have a bachelor's degree.  How old is this guy?  61.  Hey, that's over your bracket.  He doesn't want children. 
[03:38:00]  Doesn't have any.  Doesn't have a car.  He's a retired executive living the life in New York City.  Now, that sounds like fun.  Yeah, so is Bernie Madoff.  Oh.  The fuck is...  What sounds like fun about that?  That sounds like fun.  A retired executive living in New York.  That sounds dull.  Let me tell you about the time.  Ha-ha.  I had a hostile takeover.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Blowing cigar smoke in your face.  Well, he says he doesn't smoke.  Oh, wow. 
[03:38:30]  Silly me to make a joke about it.  Would you like any of these guys to eat your ass or...  Yeah, what about it?  What about sex with any of these guys?  Point to the one guy that you would like to eat your ass.  Oh, no.  I wouldn't want to be like that.  You have to pick one.  Remember when you said you wanted the edge to have sex with you?  Out of all these guys that are interesting, you point to the one guy you wouldn't mind  eating your ass.  Look at...  When they're all put up there, it looks like face blech.  Come on, Patty.  You have to pick one.  Oh, no.  The black guy?  Oh, no.  Patty. 
[03:39:00]  Patty.  Are you into the black guy?  Oh, no.  No.  Couldn't you put a race in there?  No.  You couldn't put a race preference?  No, because...  Why?  Could you, though?  I don't know.  Maybe.  I think you can, Patty.  No.  You know what a black guy would do to your 54-year...  No.  No.  54-year virgin pussy?  Patty.  Danny started typing in a response to the big black guy.  No.  No.  Oh, please.  This is her whole life.  Come on.  She's panicking.  What is he about? 
[03:39:30]  What is he about?  Let's see what he's about.  What do you think he's about?  Patty, stop.  Let's see what he's about.  No, I'm not going to send him anything.  Get to his bio.  No, I'm just trying to get that out.  Get to his bio.  He's a divorced 45-year-old man.  Is there a nice woman out there?  I want to read stuff.  Body type.  Athletic.  Yeah.  He...  What about...  Yeah, there it is.  He drinks socially.  He's divorced.  Athletic.  The guy's ripped.  The social worker and personal trainer.  This guy will fucking destroy you.  Meanwhile, that means he went to prison.  He's a personal trainer. 
[03:40:00]  Well, graduate degree.  He's a professional.  Do you want children?  Undecided.  He's open-minded about it.  He doesn't do drugs.  He has children.  And he has a car.  Until the LoJack system sends out that signal.  What kind of music?  I think you could click on the interest.  It says music.  Oh, right.  Let's see what kind of music this guy likes.  What is that?  I don't know what that does, Patty.  What does that do?  Now we're somewhere else.  Yeah.  Those are all the girls he's interested in. 
[03:40:30]  Exciting.  What does he say about me?  Hi.  Just here looking for a nice, interesting woman.  I have a variety of interests that I would love to share with someone.  And also hope that we have some uncommon interests to share with each other.  That sounds interesting.  First date.  For a first date, I would do anything where we can talk, laugh, and get to know each other.  As I deep dick you with my balls, pull them out and go, booyah. 
[03:41:00]  Delete her account.  Delete her.  Wow.  What do you think?  A little chocolate in your peanut butter?  There's so many other choices there, too.  I think she secretly has a black.  Yeah, yeah.  She wants a black guy.  Oh, my God.  What's this guy?  All right, Hamilton.  Aged Spicoli.  Here's a 44-year-old Caucasian. 
[03:41:30]  He's an Aquarius.  Yeah.  He's from Jersey.  Does he drink?  No.  He's single.  He's an audio engineer, man.  Hey, you can talk about music with him and stuff.  Yeah.  He doesn't want children.  He has a car.  He's got lovely long locks.  What do you think of that?  He's the coolest one so far.  He's the coolest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I would love to get to that one.  Is he at every trial he's there?  Where is he? 
[03:42:00]  Whoa.  It's on a brick wall.  No.  I don't think it's a brick wall.  It's yellow.  When I went the other day, it was yellow.  What are you talking about is yellow?  That's a brick wall.  I thought there was some brick somewhere.  You can see what color it is.  Well, I went to FH Riley.  They painted the wool yellow.  All right.  Oh, you're talking about FH?  Yeah.  FH.  I'm sorry.  I do apologize.  Yeah.  Tell Brett that Chicken Farfowl is the best.  Would you go on a first day to FH Riley?  Sure.  Why not? 
[03:42:30]  It's a great place to go.  Oh, at 400 New York Avenue?  In the heart of Huntington Village?  Oh, we're talking about the Spicoli guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, not the guy before.  Come on.  I don't want to wreck the joint.  It's a little joke.  Of course.  I was only joking.  Patty.  Yeah.  Terrific.  Okay.  You have to tell us which guy you would want.  I like the one with the 44-year-old one the best.  He's cool.  Now, what's the next step?  What are you doing?  So he's the one that you would allow to eat your ass, right? 
[03:43:00]  Not eat my ass, no.  What are his interests, Dan?  Oh, the black guy?  No, no.  We looked at him already.  The guy with the long hair.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  I gotta go back.  Sorry.  I've been...  I should've...  I've been perusing these sexy asses.  Have you?  Danny's gonna be on...  By the way, as Danny finds that, Sam ran out with Bobby Lee.  What happened?  He's definitely not coming back?  No, he's out of the building.  He freaked the fuck out.  He ran down the hall. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  And then he started calming down because somebody out there knew him.  Okay.  And he's like, oh, I'm such a big fan.  He's like, oh, good to meet you.  So I grabbed my recorder and then walked to the elevator with him and just kept asking  him questions.  And he told me...  He was like, listen, I want you to know, when I was in the studio, I was bad.  Then I calmed down.  I was okay.  And now I'm bad again because of you.  No, I was doing it.  I was asking him questions.  And so I jumped in the elevator with him.  He would be tiring to be friends with. 
[03:44:00]  He is exhausting.  He literally...  I got on the elevator with him and kept asking him questions the whole time.  When the elevator opened, he ran through the lobby and out the building.  He ran away from you?  Yes, he ran.  Long-haired.  The guy doesn't have any about me.  Oh, really?  That's a little...  That's suspicious there, Patty.  Yeah, what are you thinking there, Patty?  There's nothing about him.  I don't know.  I would like to know...  Well, maybe not.  I have to know something about him before I see him.  That's a guy that's cheating.  And just in case someone sees his picture on this side, he goes, oh, one of my dopey 
[03:44:30]  friends put me up there as a gag.  Obviously, Patty likes this guy.  Yeah.  Why don't we contact Mike?  Yeah.  Or whatever his name is here.  Yeah.  And let's type out what Patty should say to this guy as an introduction.  Yeah, come on, Patty.  We'll help you.  No, because you're going to make me say really dirty things.  No, no, no.  We won't.  We won't.  And I don't want it to think I'm like that.  We won't.  Okay.  Put hi.  Hi, Mike.  Hi, Mike.  Hi, Mike.  All right.  Yeah, but I'm going to be a lot faster than you type.  Yeah, you type too slow. 
[03:45:00]  See, you got caps lock on.  You're already yelling at the guy.  Not high there.  Yeah, you're yelling.  What are you doing?  Oh, my God.  Now she's got cap locks on.  So it's capitalizing everything.  Except what she wants to capitalize.  Just let me do it.  Let Danny do it.  He types fast.  Dictate to him.  Just dictate.  All right.  We're running out of show computer wise.  We're not going to have a show of Patty typing.  Patty.  I refuse.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Let Danny do it.  And you tell him what you want to type.  That's fair.  Hi, there.  See, there you go. 
[03:45:30]  My name is Patty.  Hi, there.  My name is Patty.  See, so far so good.  My name is Patty.  I am on plentyoffish.com and would like to meet you.  So you want to say that you're on the same website this gentleman is on, obviously.  Yeah.  He knows what site you're on.  It's her, though.  Let her.  And I would like to meet you.  And I would like to meet you.  How about I would like to get to know you?  Danny, pump it up.  Yeah.  Danny needs to punch it up a little bit.  Get to know you. 
[03:46:00]  Not in every way.  Please take that off.  That's all right.  Don't touch me.  It is not okay.  It is not okay.  Not in every way.  Because it implies something.  It doesn't imply anything.  All right, Patty.  Let's see.  I'd like to get to know you.  All right, good.  Can you contact me through this website?  All right.  And write me a no.  Again with the website.  No.  Can you contact me through plenty of fish?  No.  Do not give out my number.  I don't know. 
[03:46:30]  I want to be the one to give out my number.  Like he's giving out your number.  You know, I've got to protect myself.  Sure.  Shut up.  Yes.  Can you contact me on this site?  On this site.  And, you know, if you respond, then if you respond, maybe I can have a chance.  Maybe you can eat my pussy.  Do not.  Oh, my God. 
[03:47:00]  What?  No.  Maybe you can eat my pussy.  Patty, we're trying to help.  We're trying to get you dates.  Come on.  Come on, Patty.  What's wrong?  Come on.  Patty.  Patty.  Drop me a line.  You're typing stuff wrong.  All right, Daddy.  You promise not to.  I promise.  All right.  Let me a line.  You fucking.  Drop me a line if you are interested.  All right.  Let Daddy run.  Let Daddy run.  You are interested.  That's it.  That's all I have to say.  No.  He's got to punch it up.  Let him punch it up a little. 
[03:47:30]  I'm typing this.  I'm typing this.  Nice.  To you.  Topless.  No.  It's too late.  I already signed it.  Do not.  No.  I could do this all day.  Have a great day.  Have a great day.  Have a great day.  Patty.  All righty.  He's like.  That's boring.  He ain't writing that.  He's not going to write back to you.  No.  We have to put more stuff in there if he's going to write back.  That's boring. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  I don't care.  I want to be boring.  He's never going to go for that.  Patty.  Let Danny just punch it up in a nice one.  Come on.  Let me just.  I'm not going to do dirty things.  Why would he do that?  He's already done that.  Now he's got to just punch it up nice for you.  In the end, we'd love you.  Jesus, Patty.  Relax.  Will you?  How long have you known us?  Relax.  I don't want to know too much.  I would rather have that on the first meeting.  All right.  All right.  I understand.  Let Danny just.  Because have a great day.  Patty's boring.  Let that be the last line.  Have a great day.  It's got to be at the bottom. 
[03:48:30]  Let's see.  Drop me a line.  Wait, Patty.  My name is Patty.  I'm 54 years old.  I'm 54 years old.  No.  Do not say I've never had sex.  Why not?  It's the truth.  Why?  No.  Because that's not what I'm after.  I'm 54 years old.  You are too.  Describe a pretty.  Let Danny.  Yeah.  No.  All right.  I'm 54 years old.  Relax.  With a gray haired pussy.

I don't want anything to go over to the, you know.  All right.  We understand.  Because you'll get kicked off the site.  Excuse me.  Danny's just slamming emoticons on it.  Guys love emoticons.  They do love emoticons.  The more emoticons I get.  The better.  The sexier it is.  So cute. 
[03:49:30]  Put an emoticon on there.  Yeah.  One with a big dick.  One with a smiley face pissing on a sign or something.  No.  Those are funny.  Why?  That's fun.  No.  Those are funny.  I am 54 years old and look great for my age.  Why don't you put the shit happens emoticons so when he sees you, he'll understand.  I.E.  Example.  Very good, Danny.  This is very smart.  And it is.  Excuse me.  No.  No.  Oh, Danny.  You're supposed to put in the blue letters.  Oh, my God.  I don't want anything like that to go out. 
[03:50:00]  You know, they'll ban me from the website.  That's not what this is about.  No, they won't.  All right.  This is a very nice thing for Patty, Danny.  You're a fag.  Sam, you want to.  I don't trust Danny anymore.  Let's Sam do it.  Hey, no.  You got to answer the blue letters.  Just the blue letters.  All right.  Blue letters.  All right.  We're not done.  H-Q-G-D-B.  Yeah.  Patty, Danny wouldn't hurt you.  You know that.  Like my hat.  Like my hat.  No.  No. 
[03:50:30]  Sorry.  No.  No.  What's wrong with that, Patty?  Come on.  If he thinks you have a tight punt.  Danny just wrote in subject line, us fuckers.  I'm sorry.  That's what I'll do.  I'll put interested.  Interested.  In your dick.  No.  No.  Okay.  I just said. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, my God.  No, you did.  Yes, it did.  I just did in your dick.  It just said.  Oh, well.  It said interested in your dick.  Hey, can we play?  And it finally said.  It didn't go through.  Yes, it did.  Yeah, it did.  Hey, Travis, can we play Joy Division Shadowplay for Bobby Lee, please?  Oh, God damn.  That's funny.  Even though most people know the killer's version, the original is pretty damn good, too.  It did sound.  See?  That's why she just realized it did sound. 
[03:51:30]  I hope it didn't.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Interested in your dick.  By the way, can I have my clothes?  I don't have your clothes.  Where are your clothes, Patty?  They were underneath me right down here, and now they're missing.  Oh, boy.  I saw that.  Bobby Lee took it.  I noticed that about 10 minutes ago.  No, we didn't.  Bobby Lee's punishing us by taking the clothes.  I saw that in a movie once.  They took all the guys' clothes.  Oh, well.  Yeah, you got them in the next room.  Well, you love Ron and Fez better than us anyway, so I'm sure they'll give you your clothes back.  Give me my clothes, please.  Because they treat you nice. 
[03:52:00]  They'll buy your clothes.  All right.  Joy Division Shadowplay for Bobby Lee.  Bobby Lee at Caroline's all weekend long.  Jimmy back on Monday.  Yes.  Ann, have a good weekend.  You too, app, app.  Maybe I'll run into you.  Maybe not.  I know you took them out of here.  Patty, thanks.  Always a pleasure.  Always a pleasure.  Travis, get us out of here.  We're a little Joy Division, please.  No, really.  Come on.  Who's my clothes?  I don't have them.  I didn't take them.  I haven't touched your clothes.  Yes, you did.  You took them out of here.  What happened?  You closed them.  What'd you do when you closed, Patty? 
[03:52:30]  They're right here.  Patty, if you're going to bring things to the studio, you got to keep track of yours.  Close, Patty.  Come on.  You don't feel stuff.  You got to be careful.  You sit there naked in Toronto, Pat.  You're on the chair.  Oh, my.  There's a slug trail on our couch now.  That's not the other way.  That might have sounded nice.  No.  Plenty of fish.  To the center of the city where a road's been waiting for you. 
[03:53:00]  To the depths of the ocean where a road's been searching for you.  I was moving through the silence with a motion waiting for you.  I was moving through the silence with a window in the corner.  I found truth.  I was moving through the flood.  I was moving through the pit of fire.  I'm sweating that way.  I'll see you next time.  I'm going to be here.  Hopefully.  I'll see you next time.  I'll see you next time.  I'll see you next time.  guitar solo
