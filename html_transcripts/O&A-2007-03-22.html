<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a boisterous reaction to a fart, involving hosts Opie and Anthony and guest James Norton.  The show quickly transitions to a segment about getting fired, featuring numerous caller anecdotes about unusual and humorous termination experiences.  Bill Burr is a guest in the studio throughout much of the broadcast.  Callers describe being fired without realizing it, or by bosses using implicit dismissal tactics.  One caller even claims they're getting fired *that day* based on the hosts' suggestions. The discussion expands to include signs that one might be about to get fired, prompting more humorous caller stories.  The segment then shifts to life-changing events, including a caller facing divorce and another planning a marriage proposal.  Several news items are mentioned: a video of a Chicago police officer assaulting a woman, a 911 call from a man (Freddie Wilhite) who murdered his wife, claiming she "enticed" him and ridiculed him throughout their marriage (the call is played and discussed at length throughout the show), the death of Larry Bud Melman, and the death of Woody Harrelson's father.  The hosts also lament the difficulties in maintaining their website due to its proximity to pornographic content.

The discussion of Wilhite's 911 call continues, focusing on his calm demeanor.  The conversation abruptly shifts to Sanjaya Malakar from American Idol, and speculation that a crying girl in the audience during his performance was a plant.  A caller, Lindsay from Boston, calls in and suggests the girl was "mildly retarded," sparking an exchange of insults and crude jokes.  Another caller, Bob, announces his plan to break up with his wife of 17 years during lunch, and the hosts encourage him to record the event.  A segment follows where the hosts attempt – and frequently fail – to answer questions from "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?".  More callers share breakup stories, including one describing a physically violent reaction from their ex and another recounting a near-miss involving a loaded gun and their ex-wife.  Celebrity news, including Angelina Jolie's adoption and Britney Spears' release from rehab, is discussed, along with speculation on the collaboration between celebrities and the paparazzi.  The show concludes this segment with further discussion of the Wilhite 911 call and the hosts' firm stance against compromising their style or freedom of speech in a potential merger with Howard Stern's SiriusXM show.  Bill Burr promotes his upcoming stand-up shows.


The next segment centers on marital disputes and public arguments, with numerous caller accounts.  The hosts share a personal story of a public argument, suggesting a rec room as a more appropriate venue for such outbursts. The conversation then veers towards a graphic discussion of a Janice Dickinson photograph from PerezHilton.com, focusing on humorous and vulgar speculation about the darkness of her genitalia.  Several callers share relationship conflict stories, including one who bought a car without his wife's knowledge, leading to a public confrontation and infidelity, and another who fired an employee for downloading inappropriate material.  A “smarter than a fifth-grader” trivia game ensues, punctuated by humorous banter and side discussions.  A listener calls in with a mnemonic device for stalactites and stalagmites. A “MacBook Karaoke” segment features callers singing, with the hosts offering commentary ranging from mild to scathing. More caller stories of marital spats are discussed, along with audio from the Wilhite 911 call and a profanity-laced argument between Lily Tomlin and a director from a behind-the-scenes incident on a movie set. Bill Burr remains a guest throughout the segment.

The show continues with a discussion of a celebrity meltdown involving a thrown halogen lamp, transitioning to amusement park accidents, including a roller coaster collision.  The focus shifts to a YouTube video of a man screaming obscenities at a cat, using phrases like "Get the fuck down!" and "I'll fucking end you!". The hosts speculate on the man’s mental state.  A listener calls in about the Opie and Anthony tour, followed by another playing of the Wilhite 911 call, where the hosts jokingly coin the term "fatal nagging."  Bill Burr and Bob Kelly are mentioned as in-studio guests. A longer version of the 911 call reveals further bizarre statements from Wilhite, including flirtatious remarks.  The conversation turns to a "bad audio" Damon Zek political campaign video, detailing Zek's drug use and criminal activity. A lengthy discussion unfolds about one host's sweatshirt and its possible connection to Jay-Z's fashion choices. Another listener shares a news story about a farmer killing his wife with a tire iron and expressing regret for not prolonging her suffering. The hosts discuss inequities in divorce law, particularly concerning men financially devastated by divorce.  Another caller describes being wrongly arrested after his wife self-harmed to get him removed from their home.  The segment concludes with a song about a "cunt," followed by discussions of gym showers, bacteria, and another Janice Dickinson crotch photo.  The show finishes with a video of a man in a penguin costume verbally abusing children at a youth basketball game.


The segment begins with a discussion of female genitalia, speculating on the effects of frostbite and its implications for tampon use. This evolves into increasingly graphic and vulgar descriptions of female anatomy and sexual acts, including predictions about future pornographic trends.  The conversation then shifts to HPV, prompted by one host's recollection of viewing graphic internet images.  This leads to further descriptions of STDs and their effects.  Steve from Mississippi calls in, recounting financial hardship after Hurricane Katrina, claiming his ex-wife sued him for back child support despite the loss of his records in the storm and alleging she destroyed his belongings. Drew from Baton Rouge complains about guest hosts like Bill Burr dominating the show.  A 911 call from a woman threatening to kill her son with a hammer is played, followed by further discussion and additional vulgar jokes, including a man’s sexual encounter with a dead deer and a severely overweight child. The show concludes with a "Line of the Day" segment featuring more vulgar jokes.  Billy Burr and Bob Kelly's upcoming comedy shows are promoted.

Cleaned up your cubicle  Getting fired always happens around like four o'clock on a Friday  Yeah  For the people who never saw it coming, you know what I mean?  Could I talk to you?  Yeah, and the only positive thing is that you actually get to go home an hour early  Yeah  And you're like, okay, my life hasn't begun to suck yet  You're almost happy though, because you're like, wow, I got out of work early today  I had such crappy jobs that I didn't care when I got fired 
[00:04:30]  It was a relief  It was like, I'm going to have to let you go  And I looked at my watch and I'm like, oh, cool  The rest of the day off  I'm getting paid, you know  You get like paid right there on the spot  And you're out  And now I don't have to work  And I got some money in my pocket  I'm out  I never got fired  It was because I asked for a raise  And I hated the job anyways  And all of a sudden, you know  It's a typical thing, the fat boss  Is there ever an in-shape boss? 
[00:05:00]  No  It's always, you know, fat bastard, right?  And I asked him, you know  Hey, you know, I've been here for a minute  Can you give me an extra quarter an hour?  And he was like ridiculous, right?  Yeah, you used to ask for like  Could I get like 32 cents an hour more?  And you start doing the math?  Yeah  What it's going to figure out too  This is what's going to put me over the top now  Now I can do some living  This is beer money  This is my beer money for Friday night  Mom, Dad, I'm out  Now I'm living  32 cents an hour  Alright, let's wake up the people 
[00:05:30]  That are going to get fired today  Okay  It's the Opie and Anthony Show  Bill Burren  You're playing Carolines all weekend?  Yes, I am  Very, very cool  Caroline's here in New York City  Yeah, tonight through Sunday night  Okay  And our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE  We have lots to do today  We will  I got fired and didn't know I was fired once  I got fired from  How does that happen?  True Mechanical  An air conditioning joint, of course  And, yeah, tell me about it  How many of those places did you work for?  Like five 
[00:06:00]  I can't  It's a rotating staff of the same people  I swear to you  It's this  You go from one company to another  And you meet people that you've worked with two jobs ago  It's like the same people  Just wandering around  Did you have your shirt with the name on it?  At a few companies, yeah  You had to wear their uniform  I always hated like when one of the cool kids down the village or whatever  Would always have like a gas station shirt with like somebody's name on it  Yeah  Just like mocking the fact that they have an awful job 
[00:06:30]  I always wanted that person to run into them on the street  Yeah, this is just an attire for me  It's like a fashion statement  Can you imagine working at a gas station?  It's so ironic  Right  Literally have the guy, Mike, whose name's on it  Just come up and just drill him in the face with like a wrench  Give me my shirt back  I was missing one  I had to pay for that  So how'd you get fired and not know it?  I come in late all the time  That's what I did when I was in construction  Just, it was misery  So I'd be late every day 
[00:07:00]  And I was working in the shop  Which meant I didn't go out to jobs and install it  I was making the duct work in the shop  Yeah, that was another fun, great job  Working with giant pieces of sheet metal  Like razor blades  And bending them and cutting them  In the shop  Yeah, in the shop  I had to work in the shop  And there was a shop steward  And a supervisor  And just all that crap that I never wanted to have to deal with  But there I was dealing with it  And I'd come in late all the time 
[00:07:30]  And then the big boss came in  The guy that owned the company  And he saw that I was coming in late  So he was just like waiting there for me one morning  And I came in  And it was like, you know, quarter after eight  And I'm supposed to be there at eight  And I go to punch in  And he goes  Look, why don't you just go home?  And again, I'm like  Oh, cool  Cool, you're going to be the day off  I could sleep  I was tired or hungover probably  So I went home  Went to sleep  Hung out the rest of the day  And then I'm like thinking  He didn't say I'm fired  He'd just say go home 
[00:08:00]  Was he like punishing me for the day  Or, you know, kind of  You're not going to work if you come in late  But if I come in on time  I'll still be able to work  Are you thinking maybe too many guys showed up  And he just didn't need everyone  Yeah, he didn't need everyone  Plus, your only version of what it's like to get fired  Was like from like the Flintstones  You're fired  Flintstones?  Yeah  You're  You're  You're a big boss  You know, firing you  And it's you're fired  Yeah, you're fired  It's not we got to let you go 
[00:08:30]  Or why don't you go home  Or something like that  Passive aggressive  Yeah, yeah  I was indeed fired  But I wasn't sure  So I had to call up the shop  And ask around  I was like, am I fired?  They're like, oh yeah, dude  You're so fired  You're not only fired  You're so fired  It's been the talk of the shop  You got fired  I was like, oh, just making sure  Thanks  All right  I'd go to some other place  And talk myself up  And BS about my qualifications 
[00:09:00]  And get even more money  That's what you'd do  You would get fired from one place  Go to another air conditioning company  And say, oh yeah  I got all this experience  And you'd learn just enough  To make the next company  Think you know twice as much  As you know  And then they'd give you more money  And then you'd work there  And so you got fired  And then you'd go to another place  And pull the same thing  It was great  I wound up going back  By the way  Wound up going back to True Mechanical  They rehired me  For like twice as much  As I was making  When I got fired  About two years later  Wait, so you got fired again 
[00:09:30]  No, I got rehired  Okay  All right  Let's go to Carl in Pennsylvania  I got it  Carl, what's up?  I think I'm the guy  Getting fired today  See, we might have woke up  Woken up one guy  That is convinced it's today  Why today, Carl?  Because you guys told me  I mean, this guy all week  The boss has been gone all week  And we got a plus job as it is  But this guy's a snitch  Usually the boss has gone  Everybody brings their cars  In to work on them and stuff  And instead of doing work  And this guy's just pissing me off 
[00:10:00]  I thought I could deal with him  But you guys woke me up  You know  I'm getting fired today  I might have to whoop his butt  And what are some of the signs  That you're going to be fired  That maybe some of the listeners  Can look out for?  I think people  People start ignoring you  Talking to you  Yeah  They stop talking to you  Like, because a few of the people know  You're not getting  All the information  From your supervisors  That you are getting  Memos  Things like that  You keep catching people  Staring at you  Yeah  As you look over  There'll be somebody  Way across the room  Just looking like  Wow, he doesn't even know  Two people talking 
[00:10:30]  And then they'll  Both look over at you  And look away  All of a sudden  The supervisor is not  Bothered by you anymore  Like, yeah  Yeah  He's kind of just  Smiling at you  Yeah, what do you want me  To do to bother you?  Whatever you want  Whatever  He's showing a new guy  Around the office  But not quite at your area  But there's a new guy  Walking around  And he's showing him things  Oh, that's great  Yeah, they literally  Have you train him  Yeah  Why don't you show him  The ropes  The one we're going  To hang you with  Let's go to Steve  In Pennsylvania  Right  Steve, what's up? 
[00:11:00]  Hey, good morning, boys  Good morning  I got fired once  Right in the middle  Of getting a promotion  How does that happen?  I got called into  The boss's office  And as I was walking in  My boss was  Pretty much overweight  And he had these  Button front shirts  And they were always  Bulging at the buttons  So I put my safety goggles on  And he called me in  To give me a promotion  And he asked me  Why I had my safety goggles on  And I told him  If one of those buttons  Let go  Would take out an eye  And he fired me  Right there on the spot 
[00:11:30]  Wow, that's not  No sense of humor  On that guy  No sense of humor  At all  Is that a fireable offense  To me?  Could you actually sue?  Like I was doing the job  It's just a joke  Yeah, it was a joke  Joking about your hog  That's it boys  Frunkers  Alright, Frunkers to you  Let's say hi to  Maureen on Long Island  Maureen, what's up?  Hey, how you doing guys?  Alright  I have a story  Similar to the one  That you just told  About coming in late 
[00:12:00]  And then having him  Standing by the time clock  When you walked in  Maureen or Maury?  Maureen  Oh, okay  Alright, Maureen  Thought I'd ask  I know it's early  Okay, you smoke, do you?  No  You got a deeper voice  Wow, you really do  Slightly deeper voice  Especially early in the morning  Yeah  I'm at work already  But anyways  The same thing happened  I used to have to walk  Across Jericho Turnpike  The three lanes of traffic  Going each way  And depending on 
[00:12:30]  How busy the roads were  Depended on what time  I got to work  Oh, is that that street  Out in Queens  Where someone dies  Every three days?  Jericho  They don't make it at all  Quite a way  On Long Island  And some of the areas  Are just impossible  I know  There was no traffic  Light there  So, you know  It depended  Some days I made it earlier  Some days I made it late  And one time  He was standing there  And I had no idea  And I just walked in  And he goes  Don't even bother  Punching in  We got to let you go 
[00:13:00]  You can't keep coming in late  Don't even bother  Punching in  I'm on salary now?  What?  Yeah, I know, right?  You always hope for the best  The optimist  Yeah, the optimist  I did say on their softball team  No, because I used to play softball for them  So I stayed on the team  Until somebody realized  I didn't work for the company anymore  That's great  Yeah, so I did get some fun out of it  All right, thank you, Maureen  We got to go to Pittsburgh  Now they're calling in like crazy here  She was the one cranking home runs  With that voice  Yeah  Oh, man  Stay on the team 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, right?  No kidding  I bet  You suck at that softball  You suck at work  But man, you could hit the ball  Yes, you can pull the ball  We can't lose our cleanup hitter  Let's go to Rick in Pittsburgh  Rick  Yo, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Yeah, I got a similar story to Ants  I was first job fresh out of high school  Cutting grass with some guy  And he'd pick me up every day  Straight from my house  I'm like 18 years old  I kind of messed up the first day on the job  And cut down somebody's bushes with a weed eater 
[00:14:00]  But three days into the job  I'm waiting at like 6 in the morning  And this guy never shows up  And I waited for him for like three hours  Looking out my window like an eager little kid  I called him like three days later  I was like, did you fire me?  I was like, yeah  And the jerk never even paid me for the three days I worked  So they didn't show up to bring you to work?  Yeah, sometimes their bosses have to make it a little more clear  That you're firing people  We really don't want to understand it or accept it 
[00:14:30]  He dropped me off  Like, after work  And said I'll be there tomorrow  And he never showed up  He just ditched you  Oh, it's hilarious  He's sitting there like one of those little kids in that book  Angela's Ashes  Just waiting for Daddy to come home  All right, punch it out  All right, let's go to Boston  Craig, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey  Hey, Annie, can't you go fight?  Because you dream of being a superhero?  No, never dreaming about being a superhero  I used to have superhero dreams at work 
[00:15:00]  No, it was  You would save the world?  I would save the world from alien invasion  Right, right  When you work in the shop, you really  It's mindless work  Oh, you can write a screenplay in your head  That's what I would do  Like, I would stand there  And there was a big stapler  This industrial Bosch stapler  That was as big as I am  And you'd hit a foot pedal to work it  And it could just go right through your hand  With nothing  Like it was nothing  Wouldn't even strain  And you'd staple metal with it 
[00:15:30]  You'd staple like sheet metal  Into these rings  And clinch collars  And things you would need to put together  The air conditioning system  And it was mindless work  You'd have like a thousand  Of these things that needed to be stapled  And you'd just go  All day long  So your head can be somewhere totally different  And I used to imagine that  Aliens came down  And warned us that there was another alien race 
[00:16:00]  That was coming to invade Earth  And gave me all this technology that was needed  And I had to get a group together  To intercept them  And kill them  That's really involved  I used to just have like  Action hero fantasies  Me beating the crap out of like  Five big dangerous guys  And the best looking girl in the company  Seeing it  Oh, there you go  Okay, that's a good one  Even in the fantasy  We still didn't hook up  It was just enough for her to see it  How great is that?  I was such a loser  Even in your fantasies 
[00:16:30]  Even in my fantasy  I didn't get the girl  It was just enough for her to see it  And they had to be detailed  Like it was such mindless work  That all these fantasies  Had to be detailed  Down to like  Every little thing  Had to actually have  Some type of plausibility to it  Oh  I would literally have like  Catch phrases in my head  To impress the girl  The hasta la vista baby line  Or something like that  It was ridiculous  Hey, let's say hi to AJ in Brooklyn  AJ  Listen to this guy  AJ  Good morning

[00:28:00]  About 15 minutes later  And it was his wife  And it went something like this  Hi  I'm calling to say  That Tom won't be in today  Mask why  Girl he's dead  Excuse me  He committed suicide an hour ago  And she called his job  Yeah  What do you say to that  Were your palms even more sweatier 
[00:28:30]  Yeah I kind of said  Will you have a good one  Take care of that  Don't worry about it  We'll cover his shift  I'm sure she took some consolation in that  Wow  At least his shift will be covered  When you get a chance  Return his aprons  Yeah  Could you return his worker smock  Yeah he wasn't wearing that  When he killed himself was he  We could reuse that  Hey Eddie  Be honest  Were you a little relieved  That you didn't have to 
[00:29:00]  Actually fire the guy  Yeah actually a little bit  But that kind of really  Messed me up pretty bad  To try to fire anybody else  Hoping that I didn't get  Those calls again  Right right  Well you guys have a good one  I'm punching out  Alright thank you sir  We got another one coming in  It's Jewish Monkey  From California  We know you  What's up Jewish Monkey  How you boys doing today  I'm doing good  Yeah I'm an employer  Employer out here  And I got an employee  That just can't do math at all  So I was just waiting  To get some resumes in

[00:33:30]  Now how did you get her  To go to Tavern on the Green?  Is it her birthday or something?  No  A couple of weeks ago  I told her that  My other brother  Who's in the Marines  Is coming home  And he wants to go out  And I said  I'm going to take him out  To you know  Out in the city  Tavern on the Green  I think we'll have a good day  And I was like  Do you want to come with us?

Yeah  You knew on your wedding day  That you were making a mistake  An oopsie  An oopsie had been made  Is that what you're thinking  Is she coming down the aisle  Like oh my god  Aisle  Aisle  Coming down the hallway  It was in a basement somewhere  Oh the whole thing 
[00:34:30]  Was just a white trash fest  Awful from beginning to end  You getting married  At like the Knights of Columbus  Or something  I wish  Oh he wish  I got married  At a Justice of the Pieces house  And then the reception  Was at a bar  That is now a strip club  In Comac  Wait which place  Place  Place right where Vets  And Jericho split  Where our old accountant  Yeah  Yeah  That joint  Yep  And I used to go to an accountant 
[00:35:00]  That his office was  Was in the back  Of a strip club  Yeah  It was kind of behind  And underneath the strip club  It was wonderful  I love the guy a lot  And he's probably listened to our show  I'm sure he's a faithful listener  And it was just a little  Made me a little paranoid  Yeah  You know I don't know  If you should have your accountant  Working out of a strip club  But Anthony knows  Exactly  Anthony knows people  Who know people  And we went with this  For a while  I'm like oh man  This is a little too shady  For me man  Yeah I was like  Eh maybe we'll move on 
[00:35:30]  And I'm sure he's on the up and up  But it was just the whole thing  Was a little weird  Because you know  We're doing numbers  And he's like hey  You wanna check out the girls  I'm like oh  Yeah we'll go next door afterwards  And uh  I don't like mixing taxes  With uh boobies  Myself  So uh  I brought back such fond memories  Ah that's where I took my vows  Where the pole is now  Wonderful  And uh  How long did you stay in that  Their marriage  Yeah  Nine years  Yeah  Oh my god 
[00:36:00]  Yeah  Dude  Just built  Just an idiot  Dude  Wedding  Night  A little tear  Oh I was like  Oh my god  Did I make a mistake  Oh did I make a mistake  As his new bride  Was completely passed out  Just  I'm like  Oh what a mistake  Oh my god  Was this a mistake  And then uh  Maybe it'll get better  Nine years  Nine years  Maybe it'll get better  Figured it'll get better  Figured I'd hang out for nine years  Maybe when we go drinking  This St. Patrick's Day  We'll uh  Somehow magically get some chemistry 
[00:36:30]  Well thank god  I got a divorce  And I got divorced  And it's all over  Thank god  There's nothing else  Popping up  Like me being served papers  That I have to be in court  On April 12th  Uh  Because um  They think I'm a liar  Oh god  And I'm not reporting  All the income  That I'm making  What  Why do you owe her any money  You don't have any kids  What  What  What  Bill  You're insane  Bill  Bill  Bill  Why ask questions like that  Bill  You're so glib  Matt  Matt  You're glib 
[00:37:00]  You're glib  I thought  Right  I taught  If you didn't have any kids  Which we didn't  Didn't own any real estate  Didn't own nothing  Beat it  Yeah  I tried the beat it defense  Uh  It didn't work  They beat the money  Out of my wallet  Is what  Why  Why  This is really gonna make me mad  Why is she entitled  To any money  Because I am the one  With male genitalia  And she is the one  With female genitalia  And for some reason  That means you 
[00:37:30]  Have to give her  Boatloads of money  Why  Because that's the way  This country works  Because when you're in a courtroom  In a divorce  No I understand  You live like a caveman  They have caveman rules  When you're in court  Because for every woman  That says  Oh there's a glass ceiling  I can't get as high  As a men can get  In this company  We want our independence  We're powerful  Strong women  Once they get into  A divorce court  They're helpless  Poor things  That can't do anything  And I need his help 
[00:38:00]  Oh there's nothing  For a poor woman  Out there  Get a job  Does she work?  No  Hasn't worked  Since we got a divorce  Doesn't work before it  Doesn't even drive  Ugh  Nothing  Do you ever even talk to her?  No  I don't wanna see her  F-ing face  And I'm gonna have to  In court  I'm gonna have to  Look at her  That's the part  That annoys me the most  Can she even make  Eye contact with you?  I should make a thing  Where we have to be  Like have a wall  Between us  Like the old dating game  How old is she? 
[00:38:30]  I don't know  In her 40s somewhere  Does she have all her digits?  Apparently  Yeah  All festooned  With claws  From the 80s  These long fingernails  That are just  I call them talons  To pull the wallet  Out of my pocket  Wow  Like a bird of prey  She sweeps  Swoops down  Like my wallet's a rabbit  And just  And you're literally  Yeah  You're literally  Scampering across the plane  Like a little brown one  I'm trying to run  I just detect  There's danger 
[00:39:00]  And  What happened to it?  When you go to court  You gotta get one of those  Dog lampshades  Oh like I've been wounded?  No  Just so you don't have  To look at her  Oh  Oh that's a good idea  Or horse blinders  Where I could just  Look at the judge  No I say you just  Walk in with one of those  Lampshade things on  So you can't look  To the side  Yeah apparently  I've been really good  Has the judge  Ever said to the woman  Have you tried  To seek employment?  They don't do that  I wish they did  You know and I said this  During the divorce proceedings  I said you would like to think 
[00:39:30]  That court is like TV  Where every case  Is looked at on its own merits  And at the last minute  A witness barges in  And the judge is listening intently  And you have a story  And they go  Wow that makes sense  Yes  The case dismissed  Or something like that  It's all cookie cutter  It's based on a slide rule formula  And they don't pay attention  They don't listen to you  They don't look at any  Individual facts  It's person A  Versus person B  And here's the math 
[00:40:00]  And here's what happens  Let me get this straight  She doesn't work  Yeah  You're paying her  And  And now I have to go back  I'm trying to get a job  And you have to give her  More money  They don't think  That you're giving her enough  They don't think  I'm giving her enough  Because they think  I'm lying  That I'm not reporting  All the income I'm making  Because apparently  They think we're making  Stern money here  Dude I am never  They are in for a big surprise  Ever  Ever  I'm never getting married  No  Ever  Never  What is in it for the guy  That's what I want to know  I want to know  What exactly  A contract that can only screw you 
[00:40:30]  Other than  My life  My life is over  Yeah  I thought if you didn't have a kid  And you walked away  It was like breaking up  Oh  What are you kidding  It's  It's  It's  Hell  I've heard  People have told me that  Oh yeah dude  You don't have a kid  Alright you're fine  Dude you're fine  No no no  I guess that means  If you don't have a kid  And you're a complete failure  And you're not making any money  Then you're filled  Oh then you're free to go  No kid  No house  No nothing  So marriage is an advocacy  To become a complete loser  Yeah  Yeah 
[00:41:00]  The check he sends her  It would make your head spin  And she like  Signs it on the back  Under protest  She's been doing this for months  Yeah so I knew something  Under protest  I take all this money from you  Under protest  And I gotta look at that  And go like  Oh my god  I'm  I'm fulfilling my obligation here  As per the agreement  I'm fulfilling an obligation  Wow  And I'm getting bitched at  On the back of my own check  And then  I get served with papers saying 
[00:41:30]  Hey  Oh my god  Pretty much  To sum it up saying  Well we don't believe  That you are making  What you say you're making  We think you're making more  So we're gonna drag you  Into court now  And prove it  And you know what  Oh huge surprise  They're in for  Huge surprise  Because if  Now wait  Will she have to pay  Your lawyer fees  For dragging you in  For this frivolous suit  No actually  She's looking  For me  To pay her lawyer fees  Which by the way  You have to do  In a divorce  Men 
[00:42:00]  Have to  Not only pay their own lawyer  But pay the woman's lawyer  So it's like  Could you screw me  And I'll pay you  Is she trying to end up  At the bottom of the lake  In like six different pieces  It's just  You know something  That  That does  You read about that  In the news  And I would never  Advocate anything like that  I'm not that kind of person  I have too much guilt  I'm not like that  But let me  Let me tell you something  You do get a certain  Understanding  Of what these people  Are thinking  Hold on  Speaking of which  Because we do have to 
[00:42:30]  Take a break  We definitely can continue  With this  I can't believe that  This will lead to the guy  Who killed his wife  And we got the 911 call  Oh  You know  Exactly what you're  You're thinking Bill  A guy did it overnight  And this  This is  Priceless audio  We'll play for everybody next  I can't believe  You guys don't have  Kids  You can't even get a damn job  No kids  No  And we didn't have anything  You know the divorce  Took three years  Three years  Like  Like  Like  I'm friggin  Donald Trump  Let me ask you  Where are the pests  In all this

[00:47:30]  Bill Burr in  On his nightmare  That was his marriage  By the way  When it goes down that road  Bill I got to turn around  I can't  I can't  That's the only time  I get uncomfortable  On this show  To see my friend here  Suffer  I was saying during the break  If they made a movie about that  You couldn't do it  Because they would say  That that was  Female bashing  Oh yeah  Woman hating  Misogynistic  Piece of garbage  It's all based in fact  That's what happened  What can I tell you  I got to go back 
[00:48:00]  I got to go back  In there  That idiot  Going to the tavern  On the green  Yeah  Just smack him in the face  And go stop it  Just sitting there  Under the glow  Of those Christmas lights  So you can't even  Like think clearly  Yeah  What a mistake  You're making  It's so beautiful  She's beautiful  My life is going  To be beautiful  You know what  A big rock  You know what  A big diamond ring  Looks like  Under sparkling  Christmas lights  Like tavern on the green  It's like a magical moment  They probably sparkles  Like crazy in that place 
[00:48:30]  Those rings are like that  To hypnotize the guy  Yeah  It's just  Don't care about  Signing a contract  That I wouldn't sign  To sell a car  Meanwhile I'm basing  My entire livelihood  On a contract  That is so one sided  It's a behind the music contract  Yeah  You should sign it  You should get married  Like out in a parking lot  And sign it on like  A 75 Lincoln Continental  Some guy with a big cigar  You're going to be  A big star kid  Let me tell you  You're going to be  A happy couple  Happy couple  He shoves it  In his inside pocket 
[00:49:00]  And walks away  Alright listen  It is one of those contracts  Awful  Let's say hi to Dave  In Pennsylvania  Hey guys  How you doing today  Hey there Dave  Billy I'm coming to see you  This weekend over at  Caroline's on Saturday night  Oh that's great man  Thank you  Yeah you always  Put on a great show  I got to tell you  Really fast you know  I got to kiss Bill's ass  Another one of these comedians  That every time you see him  You get a lot of  Different material  I'm so sick of the guys  They come through  And it's the same stuff  You saw last year 
[00:49:30]  Like what are you doing  Yeah  I don't know  I don't know  I'm so psycho paranoid  It's not even a good work ethic  I just have this  Reoccurring nightmare  Of the whole crowd going  We heard that  Last time  Heard that already  Yeah  So you're going to hear  Different stuff  When you see Bill  At Caroline's  And you're going to  Laugh your ass off  Go ahead Dave  Yeah hey  The topic I was going to  Bring up was  Did you guys hear about  This guy that shot  His wife out there  In Texas with a 38  And then calmly calls up  911  And has no 
[00:50:00]  Has basically no mental thoughts  This guy  Yeah  I think the guy is relieved  This guy is so relieved  He doesn't even care  He probably knows  He's going to prison  But being married to this woman  Was worse than killing her  And going to prison  That's what this guy is thinking  Is it total redneck or what?  Oh, yeah, he sounds a little drunk, too.  Oh, yeah, and he just, the way that he takes care of, you know, calling 911, he's just, well, I did it. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, we got the clip.  I did it.  Yeah, we're going to play the clip.  What's the headline?  He just, I killed my nag wife.  My nag wife, he says.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  And, hey, Ann, can you tell people how to punch out correctly again?  They don't get it.  Thanks.  Bye.  Very good.  Yeah, you can't punch out after you hit the ground.  Yeah, you got to know if something's going really bad on the show, you punch out before you, you go all the way with what you're.  It's like an air show.  I want to talk about it.  Yeah.  You see your little pilot disappear behind the tree line.  Right.  Then he's punched out successfully. 
[00:51:00]  His mugshot, by the way, this guy.  Yeah.  He's an older gentleman.  Of course he is.  He's had years.  He's got a nice smile on his face.  He is so relieved.  He's like, yeah, I did it.  What's it to you?  Yeah, I go to prison for the rest of my life.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I'm hanging out with the guys.  Prison rape cannot compare to what I've been through.  Yeah, to what he's been through.  This is his chance, though, to probably finally hang out with the guys.  Like, he probably wanted to hang out with his friends or something.  It was just like, no, you're not going out.  So he figures, eh, prison. 
[00:51:30]  A bunch of guys would play some cards.  He shot her in the gut, too.  That's like the painful, agonizing death.  But it takes a long time to die.  You're going to be okay.  Come on, say it.  Say the goddamn words.  You're going to be okay.  Let's get into the story.  There's so much here.  You're about to hear one of the most bizarre 911 calls ever.  67-year-old Freddie Wilhite called police.  He calmly told the dispatcher he shot his wife, and he even confessed why he did it. 
[00:52:00]  This is Freddie Wilhite.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach with 38.  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's lying on the floor.  Why did he do this?  She enticed me, and she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  I'll say if she's alive.  Sir?  She's alive. 
[00:52:30]  She's dead.  Are you alive?  Can you believe that?  Or are you dead?  Wilhite surrendered without offering any resistance.  He was charged with murder, and he's being held on $100,000 jail.  As calm as, oh, I think someone's at the door.  I'll be right back.  Yeah, let me see if she's alive.  You alive or are you dead?  Yeah, but you hear it in his voice.  Why did you do it?  She enticed me.  You enticed me.  You enticed me.  My whole life.  And then you hear the female reporter's just like, can you believe that?  What? 
[00:53:00]  Enticed him.  Yeah, they just suck on the news.  That is definitely, that's a big word.  If the man you're with starts saying, you're nagging me, that means like...  You might want to back off.  Yeah, you're beginning the murderous process.  The process of little circuits clicking together in his brain.  Yeah.  We're not good with emotion, and we try to solve problems.  Let's just hear the 911 call again.  Here it is. 
[00:53:30]  Listen for the part.  Are you alive or dead?  This is Freddie Wilhite.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach with 38.  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's lying on the floor.  Why did he do this?  She enticed me, and she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  I'll see if she's alive.  Sir?  She's alive? 
[00:54:00]  She is.  Call ends like that?  Isn't that amazing?  Oh, that's great.  Are you alive or are you dead?  He sounds so relieved.  Yes, when he says enticed me.  For my entire life.  Right.  Like this guy just...  You never did anything with your life.  You're a loser.  You're a bum.  Why did I ever marry you?  And he's just like looking at the 38. 
[00:54:30]  I could do this.  How long do you think he thought about it before he did it?  How many years?  Decades.  Decades, right?  Decades just laying there.  And he waited to the perfect age.  He's probably going to die during the trial.  Yeah.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  He don't care.  All right.  Let's go to Lindsay in Boston.  This is a little one-sided, I think, the way we're looking at this.  Maybe.  Let's go to Lindsay.  What's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on that. 
[00:55:00]  I think she might have been like mildly retarded or something, that girl on American Idol.  Mildly retarded.  Got to love the Boston accent.  The crying girl on American Idol.  Yeah, she's a big star today.  Apparently, she was a little bit of a plant, though, from what I'm hearing.  She's 13 years old.  She cried during Sanjaya's performance.  But, yeah, she was supposed to have tickets for Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?  Yeah.  So she's out there in Hollywood.  And then somehow she gets tickets through that show to see a dress rehearsal, because they do a dress rehearsal before the live version of American Idol. 
[00:55:30]  So she went to the dress rehearsal and burst into tears when Sanjaya came out.  And apparently, you know, the producers of the show go, this is great.  Give her tickets for the real show.  That's why the camera was like, it knew exactly where to go.  Yeah.  It like went to her so many times as he was out there singing, and she's just crying.  And it looked like she was like pushing the tears out at some point.  I don't know.  I know kids like to just burst into tears like that.  We had a dog collar on one of those electric shock collar.  Yeah, they said, could we just put a shock collar on you? 
[00:56:00]  They're just so forcibly trying to make like a Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show.  Yeah, yeah, make a moment like that with a crying girl who can't keep control of herself.  We can't do that because she would complain.  Well, what if the person was mildly rattatted?  Rattatted.  She put him over, though.  Yep.  He made it through again.  He made it through again because of that moment, I think.  And last night's vote-off was really important because now the ten remaining American idols or whatever.  They tour. 
[00:56:30]  They tour the country.  So he's in.  He's set.  You're going to see him in your city this summer.  Thank God.  Oh, I can't wait.  I'm sure Patrice is getting tickets for all the dates.  That's why we're trying to get backstage.  Yeah.  He'll be all giddy meeting them.  Dude, Sanjaya should have been kicked off three, four weeks ago.  During their audition.  And someone is having what?  What was that website?  So you think she was mildly rattatted?  What leads you to believe that?  Lindsay.  Lindsay. 
[00:57:00]  I'm still here.  Yeah.  Yeah, why do you think that?  Think what?  That you're mildly rattatted.  That I'm mildly rattatted?  No, that she's mildly rattatted.  I don't know, guys.  Just whatever.  But no, the girl was mildly rattatted?  Yeah, she looks a little off.  She looks like she had the little downs kind of thing.  She looked like the low eyes and the low set ears and the big mouth.  She looked like a flounder.  She's just a little girl with braces.  A little girl.  She looked like a cop.  Right. 
[00:57:30]  A cop.  A cop.  Not a law enforcement officer.  The fish.  A cop.  She looked like a lobster.  A lobster.  A lobster.  Sanjaya.  Sanjaya, he looks like an Egyptian.  Egyptian lace carrot, if I may.  Egyptian lace carrot.  Wow, did you nail it.  Hey, man, you came back strong just when we were going to hang up on it.  That's good.  She's got it down, man.  He does.  An Egyptian lace carrot.  No, that's perfect. 
[00:58:00]  Punch out right there.  You want to end with a fine line like that.  You've done good.  Starvation for Sanjaya.  MySpace.com, you know, slash starvation for Sanjaya, if you want to check it out for yourself.  About me.  Hi, my name is Jay.  I've always been a big fan of American Idol, so like many people, I was excited for the  sixth season to start this year.  Aside from the initial debacle with contestant Antonella Barber, season six was starting to  look like it may be actually very good.  The big voices, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, it goes on.  All right.  However, there's one hinge in the broad spectrum of talent this year, Sanjaya. 
[00:58:30]  We have no problem with Sanjaya, personally.  He seems like a very personable and charming young man.  However, he does not belong on American Idol.  The judges falter with their decision to place him in the 24, and American Idol voters have  done even worse by keeping him on.  So until the day that Sanjaya is no longer on American Idol, I will be going on a hunger  strike.  All right.  This means I will refuse to eat anything until American Idol voters wise up and stop voting  Sanjaya through each week.  This is why this country is looking like idiots. 
[00:59:00]  Maybe other countries, they go on a hunger strike because some sort of political reason.  It's because there's genocide going on in their country or some kind of important thing.  Some sort of Gandhi-esque thing going on.  Some sort of movement to try to get power to the people.  And we literally have shows here like, Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?  We're literally admitting to our stupidity.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know why everyone else hates Sanj.  I kind of stopped paying attention in the fourth grade.  I think I can take him, though.  He's smarter than a fifth grader. 
[00:59:30]  What exactly are you going to wait?  Is that the moon or is that Pluto?  Oh, God.  We really should get a few of those questions because I would like to know what fifth graders  are knowledgeable in these days.  That's why the show works because it's all that stupid knowledge that you forget about  after you're in fifth grade.  Do you, though?  I think if you got some of those questions, all of us would.  Because I kind of remember all that stuff.  I know.  Well, you're like a weird brain man. 
[01:00:00]  I just forgot high school.  Nothing makes me want to hit a kid like a little precocious kid who's wise beyond his  years.  Yeah.  Hit those little bastards.  They always have them like, they were really bad with the dialogue back in the day in movies.  Like the way they would, they would have kids literally talking like they were in the  middle of like their second marriage.  And they were like in like fifth grade.  And it was supposed to be considered cute.  I always hated those kids.  Even when I was a kid, I just like the dreams of like uppercutting.  Yeah.  Just smack them across the head. 
[01:00:30]  Shut up.  All right.  Hey, we got another life changing moment coming in.  It's Bob.  What's up, Bob?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, and hey.  Hey, what's up, man?  How are you guys doing?  Good.  We're good.  I'm a contractor.  I work about 12, 14 hours a day.  And my old lady does not appreciate anything I do.  And I met somebody else when I was on a job doing a kitchen.  And I am telling my wife today.  Who, the plumber?  Wait, how long have you been together?  17 years. 
[01:01:00]  17 years.  You're telling your wife 17 years what?  Wow.  I have another woman and she's done.  Wow.  That is going down today.  That is going down at lunchtime.  I'm meeting her at lunch.  Does she have any idea?  She has no clue.  Are you guys still living in the same house?  We've been, but she hasn't been putting anything out.  I haven't gotten any.  So wait, last night.  Hold on, hold on.  Because this is what we want to know.  Last night, did you guys watch TV together? 
[01:01:30]  No.  All right.  So you went to bed.  She was sleeping right next to you, right?  Yes.  And you were able to fall asleep knowing that today is the day it ends.  I'm looking forward to today.  Yeah.  I was going to say, how do you feel before the big game?  Oh, I got butterflies.  Did you sleep like a baby or what?  No.  I kind of tossed a little bit, but I'm eating out for lunch.  Anything you're going to try to establish in the first half?  Some sort of running game?  Establish the defense or what? 
[01:02:00]  I just got to cut him and tell her lunch right off the chute.  I'm sure she's not going to stay to eat.  Well, here you go, Bob.  Now, let me give you a little dose of reality here with your pie in the sky little story here.  Where are you going to live after you tell her this?  Do you have a place?  Yes.  Well, I'm moving in with the girl.  Oh, okay.  You're moving in with the girl.  And a nice place or a little apartment?  Actually, she has a nice house.  She's divorced as well.  Oh, right.  And you're giving up your house to your wife? 
[01:02:30]  I'm going to end up having to sign that over to her.  Yeah.  Is it a...  You got to understand, guys.  You got to understand.  When you go through this many years, I'll just...  I should be like that guy with the 38.  She enticed me.  She enticed me.  My entire life.  My entire life.  She ridiculed me.  Hey, Bob, it's a little unorthodox, but can we do it on the air?  Can you wear a wire?  Can we do a little Donnie Bross to wear a wire?  We can put you on hold. 
[01:03:00]  We can get her on the line.  You know what?  We'll make believe she's winning a nice trip to Aruba or something.  I'll tape it.  I'll tape the whole damn thing.  Yeah, do that.  Give me 1130.  All right.  Tape it.  I want to hear this.  I want to hear the misery and the heartbreak in her voice.  Last night, I tried one last time.  Over to dinner, I got home.  I got home.  I took a shower.  I sit down at the dinner table, and it starts again.  And it starts again. 
[01:03:30]  And they just don't want to listen.  What do you mean it starts again?  What is she doing?  Oh, how much money did you make today?  Not how am I doing.  How much money did you make today?  What are you doing?  And you know what?  At nighttime, when I say, hey, how was your day?  Hey, maybe we can get a little busy.  Oh, no, no.  I'm tired.  She does nothing all day long.  My kids are grown.  She does nothing all day long.  How old is she?  43.  43.  43. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Let's be honest with each other, Bob.  Did you let yourself go?  Probably not, because this other woman likes what you got.  Yeah, we got to do some sort of balance here.  Do you feel like you did anything?  How did you contribute to it?  Probably I worked long hours.  I wasn't always there.  Maybe she's going to be relieved today as well.  I doubt it.  She's going to crumble like a deck of cards.  And you're going to do it in public, man.  That could be dangerous.  I'm doing that to keep it calm, to contain the situation. 
[01:04:30]  I did it at home.  This guy thought it out.  What kind of place?  Can you say that much?  I'm meeting her in a diner.  In a diner.  If she wants to make a public spectacle out of herself, I'll get up like a gentleman  and I'll walk out and she'll look like the fool.  She's making me look like a fool for years now.  That's like that part in Goodfellas when De Niro tries to send Ray Liotta down to Florida.  And right there, I knew I was going to whack.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  There's a life-changing moment going down today with Bob. 
[01:05:00]  You really want me to call you back tomorrow if I got the tape?  Yeah, call us later today, whatever.  You got it, guys.  Well, now you're part of the show.  We want to know how this plays out.  So please call back.  I'll call you tomorrow morning.  All right.  Or this afternoon.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, Bob.  Good luck to you.  So long, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jimmy in Philly listening on WYSP.  Jimmy, what's up?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  All right.  He hung up.  Jimmy's gone.  We got questions from Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader, right?  Yeah, we did. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, you got them in front of you?  Yeah.  Oh, there's no answers on this, right?  No.  Okay.  You have the key, the answer key?  Yes.  All right.  I'm done on the first one.  Dude, I'm telling you.  What?  We all fail this.  No.  We all fail this.  No.  I want to take it.  I want to take the test.  All right.  Can you let us try to answer it first?  Because we'll definitely screw it up.  But you'll probably.  All right.  No, I think.  Fifth grade goddamn questions.  Look, I'm tapping out.  I would fail this test. 
[01:06:00]  So let's do this.  We ask you the questions and see if you would fail.  I guarantee I'm going to fail this.  Let's see how far we can get.  Bill, look at these questions.  You can't get seven wrong or you fail.  What is the compound word?  I didn't know this when I was in the fifth grade.  Thank you.  What is the compound word in this sentence?  The bus driver took an alternate route to the airport.  First thing I'm doing is I'm looking for a hyphen and I don't see one.  I will say airport is the compound word air and port. 
[01:06:30]  That's correct.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm just going to go with bus and driver.  They're right next to each other.  Bus driver.  All right.  You know what?  They're right next to each other.  All right.  We'll do it.  That is a tricky question because bus driver, you know.  We got 20 questions.  We'll run through a few here and then we'll take a break.  All right.  And we'll give you your grade at the end of the show.  Oh, good.  True or false?  Carefully, easily, and barely are examples of adjectives.  I will say true.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with true.  Because Anthony said true.  That is false. 
[01:07:00]  Adverbs.  Adverbs.  Horrible in English.  One wrong.  Horrible in English, by the way.  One wrong.  18 questions ago.  Oh, schoolhouse rock.  Hmm.  All right.  How about.  Lolly, lolly, lolly.  Get your adverbs.  It was the adjectives, adverbs.  By the way, you can play a long at home.  If you get more than seven wrong, you would fail this time.  If you like that, right off the second one, I already lose my confidence.  I try to cheat off Anthony's paper.  Now I'm in the hole.  Yeah.  All right.  What is the largest South American country by area? 
[01:07:30]  Brazil.  Yeah.  Correct.  Very good.  Yes.  That was an easy one.  All right.  Let me come with a bad answer first, though.  The cerebrum is the biggest part of what organ in your body?  The brain.  The brain, yes.  All right.  Very good.  The brain.  And the final question before break.  Inca civilizations were concentrated on what continent?  It was in Mexico.  North America?  Or is it South America?  I would say South America. 
[01:08:00]  South America.  All right.  So far, out of the first five, you got one question wrong, Anthony.  I got one wrong.  And let me, I'll confess.  I must confess.  English is, I'm very weak in English.  I've never been, Professor Anthony, where English is concerned.  My spelling is atrocious, and grammar, adjectives, adverbs, that's, I blocked it out.  Diagramming sentences?  Horrid.  Sarah, Jersey.  We got to move forward. 
[01:08:30]  Sarah in Jersey.  Sarah.  What's up?  Hi.  I want to let you guys know, that happened to me.  My ex-fiancé was a plumber, and he met some woman at a job, and he goes and tells me at  a restaurant at night that he's leaving me for some woman.  So I've been through therapy, and this poor woman's going to crumble like a deck of cards  if she does not know what's going on.  I know.  That must have been horrific.  How did you react?  Because you know you want to just start weeping, but you're in a restaurant. 
[01:09:00]  That really is kind of a cheesy, that's a cheesy way to do it.  Don't make a scene.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, at least he paid for dinner first, but I crumbled.  I was crying hysterically.  I wasn't, like, I was upset, but I wasn't screaming or anything.  People are looking at me like I'm crazy because I'm crying hysterically.  He's got this big smile on his face.  All these people are looking, it was terrible.  It was absolutely terrible.  He's got to do it at home at least.  Did you know there were problems with the marriage? 
[01:09:30]  No.  Well, I wasn't married yet.  He was my fiancee.  Okay.  And no, I mean, I put out every other day.  You know, the BJs were great.  Put out.  You know?  I mean, I didn't think anything was wrong.  You know what's funny is it all comes down for guys.  It's the sex.  And for women, it's always the money because at least he paid for dinner.  They always feel like, even if you hook up with the chick, they got to get, like, a T-shirt  or something, it was going to have some sort of, like, parting gift, a box of rice-a-roni.  I don't know. 
[01:10:00]  I felt like I did nothing wrong.  Well, Sarah, this guy's scared to do it at home for some reason.  He wants to do it in public.  I mean, it looks like he left his house for the last time.  He is out of the house already.  He's going to go to this diner.  He's going to say he's leaving her, and that's it.  It's just going to embarrass her so much.  I've been there, and if he loved her for 17 years, at least do it in a private place.  That's all I have to say.  I do it in a private place. 
[01:10:30]  All right, listen, how's your life?  You get it back together?  You got someone else?  What's up?  I recently got married in September to a wonderful man.  I didn't change my last name yet.  I'm too scared.  But I recently got married to a wonderful man, and we have a house and everything.  I just got a great job.  So everything's really looking up.  Wonderful.  All right, there you go.  That's another thing I wish the ex would do.  All right, Sarah.  Dump my last name.  Stop using it.  She uses your last name still? 
[01:11:00]  Yes.  Stop it.  I got to admit, if you're going to do that, you really should do it at home.  I mean, just to end a 17-year-old marriage, leaving your woman face down in a plate.  Yeah.  Pig, you know.  In a diner with a waitress trying to, you know, move you along because they need your table.  Yeah, excuse me.  Are you done?  You guys like to look at the dessert menu?  Right.  We got tea lime pie.  Chick, please.  Just try to, you know, fill up your coffee for the fifth time, and you're in the middle  of this intense situation.  Half-eaten pigs in a blanket just sitting in front of you. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Soon-to-be ex-husband's got powdered sugar on the side of his face.  Yeah, listen.  It's not working out.  You going to eat the rest of that bacon?  Yeah, to eat your whole meal in the middle of that?  Waitress comes over to see how everything's going.  I think if he just orders-  She's all happy.  How are you two doing?  Right.  Yeah, if your husband just orders the English muffin, you know something's going down.  I'm going to eat light. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, that's the nervous stomach.  I'll just have some soup.  All right.  Right on.  Oh, God.  We got some great calls coming in.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  I'm going to be at Caroline's Comedy Club in New York City, March 22nd, 23rd, and 24th.  Call 212-757-4100 for tickets.  That number again is 212-757-4100 for tickets. 
[01:12:30]  Hope to see you there.  God bless.  I was living for a dream  Loving for a moment  Taking on the love  That was just my style  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The show's flying by today. 
[01:13:00]  I thought I could eat.  That's all I want to do is be able to eat a little breakfast in between breaks, but...  Can't even do that.  And hit the can.  Yeah.  You know.  The head.  The head.  I never heard of that one.  The latrine.  The head?  The front of the ship.  The front of the ship.  Is that what it is?  It's old Navy man.  The one they call the bow.  You gotta go hit the bow.  The front of the ship.  Then you would just be going all over the front of the ship.  You'd be coming out in front of your face. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Listen, we started something.  That guy, he's gonna like tell his wife it's over today, 17 years.  Yeah.  Sarah's like, oh man, you gotta do that at home.  She's gonna be just out of her mind, upset, and freaking out, and all that.  And Ken now is commenting about what Sarah said.  It's Ken in California.  Ken, what's up?  Yeah.  You know, I did that with my ex.  I had told her, you know, hey, it's over.  I'm just tired of it.  We'd been together about nine years, and it led to her going way off the handle. 
[01:14:00]  I ended up with a broken toe.  She was smacking me around.  And next thing you know, I'm on top of her choking her out.  And I decided, you know what?  I should have done this at a public place.  Let's see.  Phone call today, right there.  Jody, you're ready, made whore.  How did you get a broken toe?  Yeah, how... 
[01:14:30]  Very good, though.  She was shoving...  She shoved me into the wall.  And, you know, I'd been drinking a little bit, but...  Ah, the old drinking kitchen floor linoleum.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I didn't realize it was broke until it just turned all blue and stuff.  Kind of like her face when I was choking her out.  Why not have a sense of humor?  Do it in a church or something, or a library.  Well, you know, the best part about that...  I knew I should have done it in a public place after the cops showed up. 
[01:15:00]  But they were cool with it.  They understood.  Once they talked to her for a couple minutes.  Yeah, right on.  Thank you, Ken.  All right, punch it out.  We got Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  How's it going, Billy?  What's up, man?  I had to agree with the guy about telling his wife in the diner, because about 12 years ago, I told my ex-wife that it was over with at the house.  And I'm a gun collector. 
[01:15:30]  And she went into my collection, and I've got an authentic 1941 German MP5 Schmeiser.  Oh, wow.  Thank God I had taken the seer pin out of it the night before when I was cleaning it, because it was fully loaded.  And she pulled the trigger, and all she got was a click-click.  And I about had a heart attack right there on the spot.  I should have killed you. 
[01:16:00]  I figure, you know, if you're in a public place, at least if she goes fat-ass on you, somebody can call a cop or something.  You know what I mean?  Good Lord.  Yeah, hell-hats witnesses.  Isn't it amazing?  If a guy did something like that, you'd be in jail for attempted murder.  Women can just do stuff like that.  I was crazy.  I was emotional.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I'm sorry.  It broke my heart.  I got a quick question for Anthony.  Sir?  Do you notice, like, after a while when you got divorced, that your wife might have gotten fatter or uglier? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I noticed that, like, going into the courtroom and stuff, and you've got to see her.  It's just like, ugh.  I haven't seen mine in, like, 10 years, and she looks like a blonde Roseanne Barr now.  Well, good job, my friend.  We got some funny asses.  You bailed out.  Thank you, Max.  All right.  Let's go to Charlie in Jersey now.  Charlie broke up with a girl in public, and it didn't go over so well.  Let's go, Charlie.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, it didn't work out well. 
[01:17:00]  I'm asking you for the same situation.  Like, what's going to happen when a serious buys XM and you have to kiss Howard's ass publicly if he breaks up you and dumps your douchebags?  Well, Charlie, what makes you think that's good?  Oh, and then they hang up.  All right, Charlie.  The worst part of your calls, if you want to call up and try to, like, get to us with something like that, is when you hang up.  I'll confess that.  That's the part that frustrates me the most.  I could care less what you say.  I'd actually like to, you know, talk to you, carry on a little dialogue. 
[01:17:30]  But then they, like, a bunch of faggots just hang up.  Bunch of pussies.  Charlie, you're...  Do you think you got us?  Did you tape it?  Are you going to, like, call Howie now and go, look what I did?  Yeah, fantastic.  Click.  He'll hang up on you.  Yeah, we'll see who kisses whose ass if that goes through.  Exactly.  We'll just wait and see how it plays out.  How about that?  Yeah, how about we all sit back and see how it plays out?  And in the meantime, we're talking to a hell of a lot more people, Charlie. 
[01:18:00]  And as a matter of fact, you're listening to our show.  Right.  Why aren't you listening to your hero?  I never understand that.  Then they hang up.  Oh, you chicken crap bastard.  All right.  Well, we'll just move on.  It's Elise, I guess, in Jersey.  Let's get the female point of view here.  Elise, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was just calling to end.  This is a true story.  I told my ex that I was leaving him at my grandmother's funeral. 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  Why did you choose that?  Basically, we're in the funeral procession going from the church to the cemetery, pouring rain, get lost.  Nice upbeat.  I'm on my next tell with one of my family members trying to, you know, get back together with them.  And all he's doing is cursing me, calling me every name under the sun.  I look at him, and we had been fighting for months and months and months.  And I hadn't had sex with him for about seven or eight months at that point.  And I said, you know something?  This is it.  When you're cursing me out at my grandmother's funeral, I got to go.  I just got to go. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, that's probably the smart move.  Hey, by the way, let's get the women's point of view.  So why did you stop having sex with the guy?  Basically, too abusive.  You know, yelling at me.  Italian guy.  Baby in the family.  Wanted me to be that stay-at-home, cook clean.  I had a career.  I was a breadwinner.  And I just said, you know something?  You're home.  He was unemployed more often than he was working.  I'm like, you're home.  You should be the wife.  I'm out there working in like three hours a week.  Why are you complaining to me when I'm bringing home? 
[01:19:30]  I was bringing home a six-figure salary.  I think anyone would be happy with that.  You should have slapped him around.  I wish I could have.  He was bigger than me.  All right, Elise.  Thank you so much for your call.  Thanks, guys.  Let's go to Queens.  Angelo, what's up?  Yo.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Angelo.  How's it going over there?  All right.  I was wondering, if the merger happens, how are you guys going to be acting in the same  building if you're in the same building?  Are you guys going to give him massages during his breaks?  I don't think so.  No, listen. 
[01:20:00]  I doubt they'll even put us in the same building, to tell you the truth.  We would definitely not be in the same building if the two satellite radio companies merged,  okay?  That's going to be like Bloods and Crips.  Oh, absolutely.  We would probably...  It's totally different than that.  You guys will be friends just over the radio, you know?  No, I don't think so.  We've never been friends with Howard.  Howard, he truly is a real douchebag to other radio guys, a real douchebag to guys he finds  threatening.  But what if you are?  So I was kind of flattering that he's sort of tried, kind of, to take us on, but he kind 
[01:20:30]  of wimped out as far as that goes.  Yeah.  But how do you feel about the rest of his cast?  How about Artie and all of them?  I don't know any of these guys.  We hung out with Boyd Gary back in the day.  He was nothing but nice.  Then we found out he was like a secret agent, double agent douchebag, you know, just trying  to get info for his pal Howie.  And I've met Artie a few times.  He's a nice guy.  I saw Artie at the roast for...  Who the hell was that?  That roast we went to?  Was it Jimmy's?  I don't know.  No, it was at one of those big ones that Voss took us to, I guess. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, the Donald Trump thing?  Yeah, the Trump thing.  Yeah.  I have an idea.  He was really funny.  Yeah, I mean, we're pretty honest on the show.  I have no problems with Artie.  I met him on the street once.  He was nothing but nice.  I saw him at the Brooklyn Diner, I think, with Colin Quinn.  Nothing but nice.  If he crashes us on the show, that's another thing.  I don't know.  I really don't know what he does, but...  You guys should kidnap Beetlejuice and make them pay you ransom.  Yeah, like rival colleges.  Let's take their mascot.  Our freaks are so much better than his freaks. 
[01:21:30]  We don't need Beetlejuice or any of those has-beens.  You know that a lot of his has-beens send in, like, resumes and call and email.  They're all trying to get on our show now.  Oh, if that stupid Kevin Keith Kallenbeck calls or writes one more time.  Yeah, we blow them all off, but they're all trying to get on our show.  I mean, we talked to What's-His-Name, and he was hilarious.  Quick question.  Which one's that?  I forgot his name.  The old dude.  Holy crap.  Oh, Pat Cooper.  Pat Cooper was great on our show.  What? 
[01:22:00]  Are you guys coming to the Greek parade next Sunday or what?  No, no, no.  I don't think so, sir.  No, no, no.  That's too scary.  All right, Angelo.  Thank you.  He likes both shows.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Steve McQueen's.  Or so it said in the comments.  I thought you said Steve McQueen.  Wow, this is a celebrity interview.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, that guy that shot his wife, you think she kept nagging him after she was shot?  You couldn't even shoot me in the heart of the head?  You got me in the gut? 
[01:22:30]  You don't even have the guts to shoot me.  Shoot me properly.  Oh, Harry.  It's been 20 minutes.  We got to play the clip again.  This is the thing everyone's talking about today.  Thank you, Steve.  Thank you.  So, yeah, this old dude, 67, he's had it.  He's had it with his nagging wife, kills her, and calls 911 while she's kind of still alive.  And he's just calm as could be.  You want to hear the news version with the, ooh, oh, my God, or you just want to hear the 911 call? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, let's hear how the stupid news people handle it.  Yeah, they're just lame.  You're about to hear one of the most bizarre 911 calls ever.  67-year-old Freddie Wilhite called police.  He calmly told the dispatcher he shot his wife, and he even confessed why he did it.  This is Freddie Wilhite.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach, but it's 38.  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's lying on the floor. 
[01:23:30]  Why did he do this?  She enticed me, and she would have ridiculed me throughout my lifetime.  I'll say if she's alive.  Sir?  Can you believe that?  Wilhite surrendered without offering any resistance.  He was charged with murder, and he's being held on $100,000 jail.  Can you believe that? 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God.  You know what it is?  I think people just watch all movies, and people are just like, ah, and they kill somebody,  and they're just completely crazy.  Well, you know, there's like probably an element of shock going on.  Yeah.  I did it.  It's over.  Now I'm going to prison, and you just monotone.  It's like, here's what I did.  And it doesn't always seem like these 911 calls, for the most part, when, you know,  whatever the threat or whatever is over, people just sort of have that stunned monotone.  Yeah.  I'm here at the house.  They're all dead.  Everyone.  No, they're all dead. 
[01:24:30]  Their heads are caved in.  Yeah.  At the end of Sling Blade.  That was great about it.  It was just completely calm.  Yeah.  That guy with the Kaiser Blade.  Put some mustard on the potatoes.  French rat potatoes.  That guy was so relieved, though.  I mean, say it at home.  It just feels good.  She enticed me.  Yeah.  My entire life.  My entire life.  My whole lifetime.  My whole lifetime.  She ridiculed me.  Yeah.  You know, it's funny.  If they did that on, like, one of those Oprah shows, and they would just immediately be like, 
[01:25:00]  well, you weren't giving her the emotional support.  It just immediately, it always goes to, like, what the guy is doing.  She couldn't just have been just nagging him relentlessly over decades.  The point that he shot you, you're such a C-note.  Yeah.  You don't think there was warnings before that?  You don't think at some point he said, could you shut up?  Or it probably started off like a nice marriage, the wedding.  We always talk about that.  I wonder.  Da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:25:30]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Hey, baby.  Me and you are going to shake a leg together.  It's going to be great.  Kissing in Times Square.  What do you say?  What do you say we get hitched, doll?  Come on.  Give me a shot.  Come on.  We're here under the bright lights of Times Square.  What do you say?  Me and you.  We'll be an item.  We'll be a team.  We'll move out to the suburbs.  A nice house with a picket fence.  I can see it now, doll.  So what do you say?  Oh, yes.  Ah, you make me the happiest man on earth. 
[01:26:00]  And then a few years later.  Come here, doll.  Fast forward a few decades.  You got the best stems around.  Yeah.  You fast forward a few decades and he's sitting there and it's just.  Yeah.  You got any 1960s music when it starts to fall apart?  Yeah.  It starts falling apart like late 50s.  She loves you.  Yeah.  Early 60s.  Why are you being such a whore lately?  It's just like, could you just give me some time to myself? 
[01:26:30]  I'm just trying to read the paper here.  I don't have to hear about the PTA today.  Maybe I.  I told you not to leave your socks in the foyer.  Yeah.  I always do.  I always have.  It's just something I'm going to do.  So maybe.  Did you ask about the race?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Will she ever shut up?  Holy crap.  Hey, Charlie.  Yes, hold on.  Don't lie to everybody.  You hung up on us.  I'm sorry, man.  Because actually, I got disconnected.  I swear I got to hang up.  You hung up on us.  Listen, I think you guys are funny as hell.  Don't get me wrong. 
[01:27:00]  And there's no doubt about it that you guys.  That we're the better show at this point.  Let's be honest, Charlie.  You know, we sit here and we gave Howard his props.  But even you know his time is way past.  He's calling it in.  He doesn't even work a full work week anymore.  Getting a nice paycheck.  Getting a nice paycheck.  God bless him.  But he's not talking to the same amount of people.  Nowhere's near.  Well, it's because of pay service.  I mean, same thing with him.  Well, hey, that's the choice he made.  We didn't have that choice.  We screwed up our career so bad we had to go to satellite radio. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, we're screw-ups.  And we thank XM for bringing us back from the dead.  Trust me.  And it's worked out fine.  And we're doing great on XM.  But there was something missing.  So when we got the opportunity to go back to regular radio, we were really, really happy.  But can I ask you this, my friends?  Can I ask you this?  Go ahead.  All right.  If you guys, if the merger happens, you go back to satellite radio.  I know you're on half today, whatever.  The freedom of speech is fucking incredible.  Yes.  Hey, but not on this. 
[01:28:00]  But listen, I understandably it's incredible.  And you can say what you want to do.  You guys are so funny.  It's ridiculous.  And will you accept sharing the same satellite wavelength with Howard Stern?  Are you willing to do that?  If the companies merged and we wanted to remain on satellite, we would have to share the same satellite waves.  But we're not going to be kissing anyone's ass.  But it's not going to be an ass kiss session.  You're not going to see us buddying up like Bubba is to him.  It's just not going to happen. 
[01:28:30]  I'd rather retire than have to kiss his ass.  I think we're going to have our own bosses.  He'll have his own bosses because that's what happens with a merger.  You take some of the best people from both companies.  So we feel secure in the fact that we'll have our own people.  And we're not going to be in the same building.  I guarantee that.  If we are, it'll be at the opposite ends of the freaking separate entrance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, of course, Bubba got his head so far up his butt.  Dude, he's a douche.  He sucks.  He's never done anything in radio.  He was a shock jock that couldn't adjust. 
[01:29:00]  That's why we love being back on regular radio because we're convinced that you can still do an entertaining show.  Yeah, but you have to.  Listen, I'm a big fan of yours and Howard, both of you guys.  You guys bring both two different things to the table.  You're doing what Howard can't do, and you do it so much better in a different retrospect.  That's why we take pleasure in this because he bitched and complained for years that he couldn't do a show anymore on regular radio.  When we had the opportunity, we were like, yes, let's do this.  We'll show the world that we can still do it. 
[01:29:30]  Well, I just want to say, if I came across the wrong way the last call, I apologize.  You guys are funny as hell.  I mean, you guys are hilarious, to be honest with you.  And so many different ways, much funnier than Howard.  Hey, Charlie, you know, that's very interesting.  You say we're much funnier than Howard.  Give us a different way.  Hold on, hold on.  Just give us, like, one example of us being much funnier than Howard.  Yeah, what do you like about this show?  FCC web.  Shut up.  Hey, more questions.  We're taking the test today. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, fifth grade.  The fifth grader test.  I already admitted.  Where were we?  I didn't even want to take the test.  I just know I would fail.  We've got 20 questions here.  Anthony answered the first five.  Only got one wrong.  If you get seven questions wrong, you've failed this fifth grade test.  I've gotten two right and three wrong.  Really?  I'm in the hole.  All right.  The next question, which is longer?  And give the people out there, like, just a couple seconds to answer it.  Okay.  Because they're thinking along.  They're sitting in how many they got right as well. 
[01:30:30]  Which is longer, one kilometer or one mile?  Let them think.  You've got to let me go first, because I'm going to get most of these wrong, Anthony.  All right.  We ready?  Yeah, go.  I'm going to go with a mile.  And this is literally the mindset when I used to take these multiple choice questions.  I'm like, kilometer.  That sounds longer.  They're trying to trick me.  I'm going with a mile.  Bill Burr is correct.  A mile is longer than a kilometer.  I'm back to 500. 
[01:31:00]  You both say a mile, and I don't even have to ask that one.  I know.  Yeah.  A heptagon is a shape with how many sides?  Fourteen.  No, I'm going to go with octagon is eight.  Septagon is seven.  Heptagon.  Jesus.  Nine?  Oh, my God.  I have no idea.  Six?  Your original answer of 14.  If you half that, you are correct.  It is seven sides.  I thought that was a septagon.  Dan?  Correct.  Seven.  God, that's good so far. 
[01:31:30]  One wrong out of seven.  Emma has two yardsticks.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Emma, how old is this question?  Oh, boy.  Are they taking trains?  Ebenezer has three apples.  Mildred takes two.  Are they taking trains in opposite directions?  How many will Gertie get?  Yeah.  Emma churns butter for 45 minutes.  Well, Seamus shoes a horse.  If Ulysses...  Oh, I hate these dumb questions. 
[01:32:00]  Although, this one isn't bad.  Emma has two yardsticks.  She also has a 12-inch ruler.  She laid them end-to-end.  How many feet long is the line?  Oh, that's easy.  That's four feet.  Seven feet.  Oh, wait.  No, it's two yardsticks.  It's seven feet.  No, you said four.  Seven feet.  I can't remember.  I knew a yard was three.  I watched football.  I knew that one.  Come on.  You know what a yard is.  It's seven feet.  There you go.  Summer school.  Three out of four years high school.  All right.  Of a drum, violin, or saxophone, which is a woodwind instrument? 
[01:32:30]  Let the audience dwell on that a little.  Drum, violin, saxophone, which is a woodwind instrument?  That's easy.  It's a saxophone.  It is indeed the saxophone.  Very good.  That's doing very well.  True or false, the ostrich is the fastest bird on foot?  It's got those long legs and that big ass.  It's like a track star.  Why am I thinking of road running?  I'm thinking about cartoons. 
[01:33:00]  They're trying to trick me.  Cartoons.  He's thinking of cartoons.  I don't blame them.  I'm going to say, you know what?  They're trying to trick me because it looks like a big lumbering jackass.  I'm going to say an ostrich is the fastest bird on foot.  On foot.  Doesn't have feet, doesn't he?  I would say I'm not sure on this one, but the road runner is a very small bird,  so I don't think just in stride alone, I don't think it could keep up.  Yeah, but it's low to the ground. 
[01:33:30]  Aerodynamics, very small.  It's like those Porsches.  It's not as big as a coyote.  We need an answer.  I will say true.  You are correct.  Yes.  True.  Yes, true.  So, so far, halfway through the test, Anthony only has one wrong.  Ant's going to pass this with flying.  Oh, I hope so.  Hey, we got some great calls.  Broke up with wife in front of girl.  I was leaving her for.  Firing a guy today for looking at inappropriate material on company computer.  We talked to Jeff in Detroit and Tony in Ohio next on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:34:00]  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  We're in the middle of a doozy today. 
[01:34:30]  It is the Opie and Anthony show.  What else is America talking about today?  America.  Our front page has Angelina Jolie with her latest adoption.  Another baby.  Collect them all.  She's really getting like supermodel babies.  This kid is like on the front of the post.  He's like holding a strawberry.  This is like a work of art.  That is not a mother and a child.  Picture the usual mother and a child.  You know what I mean? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, that's like.  Putting a stroller in the mall, you know?  It's kind of creepy though.  They walk into these orphanages and then they pick out the best one.  Yeah.  And all the other kids are just sitting there hoping.  Maybe.  Nah, you're an ugly kid.  You think they make them audition like reading sides and they're like, mama.  Okay, do it again, but this time I want you to feel it.  Yes.  Mama.  All right.  I'll respond to you.  Okay.  What do you need?  Hungry.  No.  No.  We'll call you.  And you know what?  She's got to have the magical poo-ha. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Because what is Brad Pitt thinking at this point?  He's just traveling the globe.  I get the love thing.  I get the having your own kid.  But then when it gets to this point where she's just traveling all over the world to adopt one of each like you guys are saying.  What is he thinking?  She's got to be that damn good to put up with all that crap.  Maybe they're just being nice people.  I'll take the Bill Burr side.  Maybe they're just being nice people.  No, you know what?  I think this is the perfect girl for him because he like, you know, she's not looking to get married. 
[01:36:00]  They're like, you know, we'll get married when people of the same sex are allowed, like some sort of protest.  Yeah.  That is the perfect.  You have a cause as to why you're not going to get married.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Also, Britney Spears out of rehab.  Yeah, I heard that on the news.  And apparently her people put out a press release that she was getting out and to please the press, please respect her privacy. 
[01:36:30]  But she did that by sending out a press release.  She'll be leaving at 220.  It would appreciate it if you guys weren't there snapping pictures.  Every celebrity that gets pictures taken of them for these magazines, somebody in the organization lets them on to it.  And why is rehab only 30 days?  We've seen all the videos and all the stuff she's done in the last few months.  Something tells me 30 days isn't enough.  I think that just scratches the surface. 
[01:37:00]  Also, they sit there and we're trying to find bin Laden.  You know, the world's a big place.  Trying to find one person is really difficult.  And you can't get – you think bin Laden is hugely famous.  Yeah.  But you can't find that guy.  But Britney Spears, it's like the publicists are totally calling.  Yeah, it doesn't matter where she is.  Here she is shopping.  She's getting some Starbucks.  Oh, they're in a bar.  They know exactly where she's going to be at any given moment.  Yeah, I can see like, you know, she's driving out of her driveway and they're like right there. 
[01:37:30]  But like if you ever truly tried to follow somebody, all they got to do is just kind of slow down.  And as the lights turn yellow, they just wait and then they just punch it.  And you're –  No, I'm completely –  You're gone.  I'm convinced that they work together.  They all work together.  Because if you really want to walk around and not be noticed, you can do it.  You really can.  But think about like all like super, super fame.  Like De Niro's like an icon.  I can't remember the last time they had a picture of him going to a Starbucks.  Sure.  Getting a coffee.  All these hugely famous people. 
[01:38:00]  I think the celebrities have people that call the paparazzi and go, well, you know, Britney's going to be at the Starbucks if you're looking for a shot.  And then Britney shows up all annoyed like, oh my God, I can't believe they know I was going to be here today.  They're in cahoots together.  Cahoots.  I guarantee it.  Until it – but I do think that there are times, you know, you shave your head or you do something insane like that, that they are going to go out of their way to follow you or whatever.  But if you – you just keep feeding it. 
[01:38:30]  But in general, most of those, you know, paparazzi shots, they're all – they're just working together for the most part.  Yeah.  I have no doubt in my mind.  The publicists know it's good for their client to get their face in all the publications.  Which I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  But I hate the people who are like – they act like they're annoyed by it.  Right.  Like we were talking earlier, Kate Moss' boyfriend.  Yeah.  He's always like giving the finger and stuff.  Yeah.  Just like –  Yeah, I'm annoyed, man.  We're just trying to be out.  We're partying and having a good time.  And you're in my face. 
[01:39:00]  And he loves having his face blasted all over.  Yeah.  You're the scum of the urge.  Yeah.  And that's part of it too.  So, you know, that's –  You've got to look like the rebel.  Yeah.  You've got to look like you're really –  Like you're not enjoying it.  Wow.  Whose hoo-ha is that?  Um.  Marissa Tomei.  Wow.  What?  Wow.  Look at that.  Monitor.  She's 40.  What'd she do?  God, these girls love showing their –  Oh, E-Rock.  As they're getting out of cars and stuff.  Oh, boy.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[01:39:30]  E-Rock just trying to turn on the monitor.  We're in the middle of a fine discussion and all of a sudden –  That's like the new thing.  He gives me this picture and I'm supposed to continue with our thoughts.  Marissa Tomei getting out of a car showing the hoo-ha.  Is that what she's doing?  She's on a –  She's on like a stoop just sitting on, you know, stairs.  You know what?  A walkway.  I understand perverts now.  They're just guys.  They've gone to strip clubs.  Yeah.  They've spent all their money and then after a while they realize,  You know what?  I can see just as many hoo-hahs if I'm like a parking attendant. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Just walking around the streets.  Yeah.  Just letting girls get out of cars.  There's one.  There's a hoo-ha shot of Janet Dickinson.  I think it's on PerezHilton.com.  Please get that picture.  My girlfriend was convinced that her area was very diseased and I'm not really sure.  I got to look at it again.  It is beyond black and not where it should be black if the girl was not being up on her 
[01:40:30]  hygiene, let's just say.  It looks like the actual is black.  Who is this?  Janet Dickinson.  Janet Dickinson.  Janet.  Janet Dickinson.  Yeah.  We'll find it and then we can find out.  Hey, let's go to Kenny, Missouri.  He's saying that her vagina is a problem there.  Yeah.  We'll get the picture and then we'll discuss. 
[01:41:00]  But let's go to Kenny, Missouri.  But E-Rock just shut down the show.  You got to know when to pop those pictures up.  I have no idea what we were just talking about now.  Kenny, what's up?  You're talking about the paparazzi.  Ah, screw the paparazzi.  Who gives a crap?  We were just trying to kill time till nine.  Who are we kidding?  Uh, Kenny, what's going on?  Kenny.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up?  Oh, not much, man.  You was talking about them wives.  You tell them about to be divorced when they're in their house or at home.  And, and, uh, I told mine in a public place and it went horribly, horribly wrong. 
[01:41:30]  What happened?  Dude, we, we went to a restaurant.  We hadn't been getting along for like seven months.  I said, I said, you know, this is, I took her to a public restaurant.  She said, I told her, I said, well, you know, I think we need to get divorced.  And when women, when women get pissed off, they don't care where they're at.  They don't care if they're in church.  She exploded.  You've been cheating on me.  I know you're a worthless piece of, and just, it was, um. 
[01:42:00]  How do you play that off?  You know, sat there and looked like, I didn't know what to do.  You thought it would be good to do it in public because you thought she wouldn't, uh, you know, go crazy.  Yeah, yeah, you know, at home, you know, we haven't got along for seven months.  I thought, oh, I really don't want to, you know, you always picture them throwing stuff.  I thought, hey, out in public, what's the worst you can do?  Break down a little bit of cotton?  No way.  She, through food, she, she was, I know you're cheating on me, you pig. 
[01:42:30]  I'll take everything you own, you, and, oh, yeah, I love you too, hon.  Yeah, wow.  Go ahead.  Be a murderer like your father.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just throwing stuff.  You can understand why, if I had to live with her for 20 years, I could understand how a 66-year-old man,  she would grind you into the ground.  Eventually, you want the weight off your shoulder.  Please kill her.  Oh, the constant nagging.  Oh, there's no. 
[01:43:00]  The nagging.  The nagging was ungodly.  Did she entass you?  We're trying to find the longer clip.  There's more to that call, by the way.  Hopefully, we'll get it in before 9 o'clock.  So, you suggest you don't do it in public because it doesn't matter.  She's going to lose her ass anyways, right?  Oh, yeah, because women don't care.  When they're mad, they're mad, no matter where they're at.  Right, right.  Yeah, but you know what's funny?  Guys never think to yell back in that situation.  You should have just been yelling back, you've been nagging me.  Yeah.  Something.  You try to stay respectable in a public place, and you think this is going to be the best way to do it. 
[01:43:30]  No.  No.  I should have been at home so we could have just screamed and hollered and threw stuff,  and it would have been at least less embarrassing.  Yeah, you just go downstairs to, like, the rec room.  You've got a couple of beanbags.  You've just got to sit there quiet and let her, like, yell so you could just, you know,  are you done?  Are you done?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you're making a scene.  You're making a scene. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, yeah, that'll work.  And you don't want to ever pull that Tony Montana scene in the restaurant.  There's children here.  Yeah.  There's children here.  You sit down.  You know, the constant nagging.  You don't do this right.  You don't do that right.  And we were only married seven years.  If it was 20, I'd want to shoot her, too.  All right.  Thank you.  We heard that.  See you.  We got it all.  We got it all.  So there's the picture of Janice Dickinson from personal.com.  What the hell's going on there?  Now, my girl thought there was a major problem with her. 
[01:44:30]  You know what?  But I don't know what that is.  Wait.  Is it stocking?  Yeah.  That's part of the stocking.  That's the conclusion I finally came to.  But I'm not positive.  No.  If that is, then her lips are rotting away.  There is a problem there, if that's the case.  Yeah.  But it's not obvious that it's the stocking.  So, I mean, it's got to be, right?  Oh, it has to be.  I pray to God it is.  I wonder if a paparazzi has, like, a slang for that photo. 
[01:45:00]  That shot.  Like, when they call up, you know?  What kind of word?  Jerry, you're not going to believe it.  I got to, you know, whatever they call it.  Yeah, I got to.  Yeah.  They probably do.  You ever seen that movie Snatch?  Code name.  Let's go to Tony in Ohio.  Tony.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, buddy?  Actually, now that I've been sitting here long enough, I've got the best of both worlds.  A good divorce telling story and possibly getting fired.  Okay.  About 10 years ago, me and my ex were having a lot of problems. 
[01:45:30]  And I decided, you know what, we need a new car.  So, I went out and bought it without telling her.  That really made things bad.  And she told me, she was like, you know what, you need to just leave.  I'm done with you.  I'm done.  I was like, all right.  So, I called up a friend of mine.  I was like, hey, can I stay for a few days?  And we decided to go out one Friday night.  And she ran into me when I was out there before I hooked up with this chick.  And she's like, you know, I'm not real sure if I want to leave you this, that, and the other. 
[01:46:00]  And I went on about my night.  And then I wound up hooking up with this chick at this bar.  And I got in the hotel room where I was at because I knew I was going to be trashy when I drive home.  Well, I'm sitting there.  I'm dancing with this chick.  And I'm talking to her.  And we're talking about what we're going to, you know, after the bar closes.  And she comes in and sees me.  And they're talking to this girl, you know, and dance with her and stuff.  And she's all kinds of mad.  She takes me outside of this place and starts just yelling at me and screaming all sorts of things. 
[01:46:30]  And next thing I know, everybody's out there watching.  And that girl comes down.  And I told her, she said, you know what?  I'm done with you.  And I reached in my pocket.  And I had my hotel key.  And I gave it to that girl and says, be here about 3 o'clock.  I'm done with this woman.  I'm out of here.  Did you get the slow applause break?  Yeah.  I love how everyone finally syncs up. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  No one can figure out the slow applause.  But it syncs up eventually.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  I got to move on.  It's hilarious.  Like the guys from The Accused are in the background.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Hit that new one.  Hey, college boy.  You're next.  The slow applause break is so stupid.  It really is.  It's always started by one guy.  Yeah.  Looks around.  He's got to start clapping. 
[01:47:30]  We got an expert on damaged Pooha.  Vinny, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  All right, we're looking at the picture of Janice Dickinson.  You can do this at home later on because a lot of you guys are in your cars now.  PerezHilton.com has it.  You got to search two or three pages in.  Go ahead, Vinny.  All right, I'll check it out.  The only thing I want to tell you is that when a woman's private area gets dark, like  purplish, it usually means that she did a lot of heroin.  No, this is...  No, it's not purple. 
[01:48:00]  You know what it looks like?  Look at that.  It's a close-up.  It looks like...  It's color.  It looks like Petey the dog is peeking out from under her skirt.  I kept looking at Nirvana's song, a heart-shaped box.  And it looks like Petey lost an eye.  Yeah, Petey's...  Something happened.  Stymie's very upset that Petey's eye popped out.  Oh, man.  Petey lost an eye.  All right, guys.  Petey lost an eye.  All right.  I hope all that made the air, but the area is very, very, very black. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  So we're hoping it's just like the pantyhose or...  Because she's wearing fishnets.  Or something.  Or maybe it's panties that are all crumped up and they're crotchless.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Do you ever see when they do the overhead shot of one of those Iraqi caravans after they just  nuked the whole area?  Yeah.  It's like burned out bodies.  It's a recon shot.  The damage assessment.  It used to be a bunker.  Oh, we got to get Jeff on the air here from Detroit.  A lot of phone calls today. 
[01:49:00]  Jeff, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, I'm on my way into our Detroit office today.  I'm supposed to go in and do performance reviews on a bunch of the guys who work for me.  And unfortunately for one gentleman, about three days ago, they found a bunch of inappropriate  material that he's downloading and storing on the company server.  It's some of those clips that went around a few years ago of women doing things with animals.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We remember those.  And he's like a 40-year-old dude, kind of creepy. 
[01:49:30]  One of those guys that if I read in the paper tomorrow that he had like three Boy Scouts  tied up in his basement, I would go, oh, okay.  I can see that.  It's the profile, yeah.  Exactly.  So this guy has no clue.  He thinks he's coming in and going to be told what his raise is going to be this year.  How are you feeling right now?  Are you excited to do this?  Are you loaning it?  Not really.  I mean, I kind of feel bad for the guy a little bit.  You know, he's like at that age where he's 40-something, so he's starting to come into the back part 
[01:50:00]  of his career.  So I think he's going to be pretty screwed here.  But I don't know.  I guess I don't want to be him going home and telling his wife that, hey, you know that  new pool we want to get this summer?  Eh, it's not going to work out.  Yeah, there you go.  I had some thinking above-ground kiddie pool horse videos on my computer.  All right, Jeff.  Good luck to you.  Thanks, Jeff.  All right, we got a girl, another expert on the damaged poo-ha.  Carmen, what's up?  Hi, guys. 
[01:50:30]  What's up, Carmen?  The reason why her poo-ha is dark, it's because she hasn't had enough sex.  Blood circulates through there, and when you have an orgasm, it circulates.  So that means she hasn't had enough, and that's why it's so dark.  No, that's called gangrene.  This is Wesley Snipes.  Yeah.  Carmen, you've got to see the picture.  You know, a little discoloration, and maybe I would go with your theory.  No.  There's a plague going on. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Picture rotting romaine lettuce.  Several orgasms.  All right, enough about the orgasm.  We're trying to get some of this on the air.  She needs to get some.  All right, thank you, Carmen.  Bye.  I have no idea what they dumped out of, but she's going for the, perhaps there's a circulation problem down there because it's not being stimulated enough.  But we're talking rigor mortis.  Yeah.  That is not just somebody not getting enough blood flow down there. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  That's cut off completely.  That's gangrenous feet.  Yeah.  It looks like a foot with frostbite.  That's what it looks like.  Yeah.  Because gangrene, you're in the process.  I figure it's got to be green on some level.  Yeah.  Because I'm smarter than a fifth grader.  It's like it's called gangrene instead of gang black.  I'm just going to shut up.  All right, listen.  We got more questions.  Oh.  If you get more than seven wrong, consider yourself a fifth grade flunk out.  We got 20 questions.  So far, Anthony has one wrong. 
[01:52:00]  One wrong.  This stupid English question got me.  This is a fifth grade test.  Right.  Where are we up to?  Okay.  True or false, the Earth's moon gives off its own light.  The audience.  This is trying to trick me.  The audience.  Because it obviously does not give off light.  It's the sun reflecting off of it.  So I'm going to go with false.  Very good.  False.  False.  All right.  Bam.  We got another one right.  A chimpanzee's natural habitat is on what continent?  Florida.  People. 
[01:52:30]  I'm going to go.  Let the people think.  Oh, sorry.  It's okay.  Chimpanzee continent is?  I'm going to go with Africa.  Of course, the continent of Africa.  Correct.  Yes.  One of those Tarzan movies paid off.  Here's a tricky one.  All right.  True or false, an icicle-shaped mineral deposit hanging from the roof of a cavern is a stalagmite.  Oh, isn't this one of these things?  Now, there's a stalagmite.  Cave or convex.  And a stalactite.  So which one is on the floor and which one is on the ceiling? 
[01:53:00]  I'm going to go with false just because anybody can say true.  An icicle-shaped mineral roof of a cavern is a stalagmite.  I know I used to have a rule for remembering this.  I believe this is true.  I got one.  I might get this wrong.  So I'm going to go with false.  False.  Oh, damn it.  That was a 50-50 shot.  You know what, though?  This is what Bill Burr brought to the table.  Like, this is the stuff they taught us in school. 
[01:53:30]  Like, when would you ever use this knowledge?  Yeah, Donald Trump doesn't know how many sides are on a heptagon of the guy.  Wait.  Did I say false?  You said true.  Oh, I said true.  Okay.  Yeah.  From the roof.  This is info.  What are you going to do with this?  Why are you still on it?  You know what?  He's like that nerdy kid.  Hey, you forgot to give his homework.  No, no.  I got to remember now.  I'll remember it because then if you're walking through a cave, you might trip over one.  That was the rule I had.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, you really are a nerd. 
[01:54:00]  This, like, bothers him.  Yeah.  It did bother me.  Like, that fills him up to be at some sort of dinner party with a smoking jacket on.  It's actually a slag.  That's just a slag might.  A good rule of thumb to remember this is that if you're walking in a cave, you might trip  over it.  An antelope stuffed head is over your right shoulder.  No joke.  He's getting that built.  That's right.  His library.  My library.  He just wants to show people that he's very smart and knowledgeable.  There is no.  It goes back to the fact that he didn't graduate from high school. 
[01:54:30]  Totally does.  And he's the smartest guy in the room.  But there's still something missing because he didn't graduate.  So he just wants to show constantly his knowledge.  He can't let go of the value of that piece of paper.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see.  Too wrong.  How long is one regular term for a U.S. representative?  Ah, let's see.  A senator is six years.  I think this is two.  A rep is in there for two years.  Correct.  Look at me coming on strong.  All right. 
[01:55:00]  True or false?  A turtle is an amphibian.  An amphibian has to be able to breeze on land and in water.  I'm going to go with false.  A turtle is a reptile.  That's right.  That's right.  It is a reptile.  Correct.  And it's doing very well.  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Greg.  Greg, you're on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Greg.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Anthony, the rule that I always learned as a kid is stalactite has a C for ceiling. 
[01:55:30]  Yes, that is what Than just wrote to me.  He said stalagmite is G, ground, stalactite, C, ceiling.  There you go, boys.  Punch it out.  Yuck.  Now, how many of you guys have ever even been in a cave?  So why would we have that?  And do you really need to know that?  Like, you just need to not bump your head or trip over it.  Hey, look, it's one of those things.  Sticking out.  And as a fifth grader, you're stressed over this knowledge.  Like, you're just convinced someday you're going to need this for what? 
[01:56:00]  To save the world or save your family from some horrific thing.  You know how you were saying we were just filling time to get to 9 o'clock?  They're just filling time to get you through high school so they can have you brainwashed  and just go work in a cubicle.  Then I got to tell you real stuff, like how to avoid getting into a bad marriage, not  to get a credit card with 52% annual percentage.  Yeah, there you go.  Then I, a stalagmite or a stalagmite?  Oh, shut up.  All right.  What is the lowest prime number? 
[01:56:30]  Oh, I think that's one.  Yeah.  One.  Three.  Incorrect.  Oh, boy.  Zero or three?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Three wrong.  Is it two?  It was two.  Oh, boy.  Three wrong.  Three wrong.  What's happened?  If I get...  Two's not a prime number.  More than seven wrong.  Can you divide it by one?  Can you divide anything by one?  Right now, you got an 85.  Damn it.  An 85?  If you answer the rest of them.  Oh, my God.  Okay. 
[01:57:00]  In the northern hemisphere, in what month is the autumnal...  Autumnal.  Autumnal Equinox.  February.  No.  September.  Yeah, September.  October.  Correct?  September.  Very good.  Three to go, Ant.  If you have a gross of pencils, how many pencils do you have?  144.  I'm going to go with Price is Right, 145. 
[01:57:30]  144.  Jesus.  Ant.  It's a dozen...  You've got to be kidding me.  What is wrong with you?  Because I used to buy a gross of bottle rockets, and it was 12 packs of 12.  No, you didn't.  You looked these up.  Of 12.  During the break, he went on the internet and looked them up.  I did not.  He started sweating.  You hear how high up his voice just went?  I did not.  I did not.  I totally did.  I swear.  I'm actually this smart.  No, it was because of bottle rockets.  It was 12-12.  All right.  So 12 times 12. 
[01:58:00]  Two to go.  True or false?  In geometry, parallel lines never meet.  Well, if you're drawing them, and you're trying to, like, show the horizon, they come together.  That's not parallel.  Well, I mean, when you drive down the road...  That's perspective.  All right.  I'm going to go with false.  In geometry, parallel lines never meet.  No, no, no.  I mean, yeah.  True.  True.  They true.  That is true.  They never meet.  Very good.  Okay.  And finally, if you add equal amounts of red and blue paint, what color paint do you get?  That's interesting. 
[01:58:30]  Purple?  Yes.  Purple.  I'm going to go with Janice Dickinson's.  Although, it could be, like, lavender.  No.  I will say purple.  Correct.  Correct.  Yeah.  See, I remember.  That was the fun stuff.  Take this stuff and mix it up.  Paint is fun.  Yeah.  Mix it up.  Make different colors.  Oh, yeah.  It was a good time.  Oh, how many did I get wrong?  Three.  Three?  You got an 85.  How about me?  85?  Three out of 20? 
[01:59:00]  I like how I'm so bad, like, nobody even bothered to even keep score.  I know.  Bill did good.  I think he had, like, five, maybe six.  Wrong?  Yeah.  If he had three, I think he had a couple more than him.  I answered the first three out of five wrong.  Well, look real fast.  Oh, this should be riveting radio.  That's why I said fast.  Fast.  Like, real fast.  You missed Heptagon.  I missed.  Okay, number one I missed.  You missed one.  I missed two.  Oh, it started off bad.  I got three.  I got four. 
[01:59:30]  I missed five.  I missed six.  I missed seven.  I screwed up on eight, even though I knew it.  Nine I got.  Ten I got.  Eleven I got.  Twelve I got.  So far, you have six wrong.  Thirteen I got.  Representative I got.  I got the Amphibian.  I missed the prime number.  All right.  Seven.  Gross for pencils.  That's eight wrong.  He's failed.  Eight.  What'd I get?  You failed.  Eight wrong is a failure. 
[02:00:00]  You get seven wrong.  Eight strong words.  Eight wrong.  Do the math.  It's a 60.  It said you flunked fifth grade.  D minus.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm in there, baby.  There might be a curve.  They might be grading on a curve.  Hey, we've been playing this audio all morning long.  Let me play it again.  This is what everyone's talking about today.  The guy that kills his wife and then calls 911.  Just in case you're just waking up, here's just the 911 call.  This is Freddie Will.  Hi.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach. 
[02:00:30]  It was 38.  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's laying on the floor.  Why did you do this?  She enticed me.  And she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  I'll say she's alive.  Sir?  She's alive.  She's alive.  I play that because I hold in my hand the entire phone call.  Oh.  We'll do that next. 
[02:01:00]  And we're giving away two MacBooks today.  MacBook carry on the way.  It's Opie and Anthony.  A prime.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Bill Burr helping us out today.  Playing Carolines in New York City all weekend long.  Tickets, 212-757-4100.  He starts tonight and goes through Sunday, right?  Yep.  Very, very cool.

And then we've got the full-length version of that 911 call we have been playing all morning long.  What's a MacBook?  A word processor?  What is that?  One of those...  What are you, Larry King?  Electric...  Yeah.  It's an electric typewriter?  Is that a laptop?  They call it a MacBook.  Oh, but it is a laptop.  It's a portable...  No, it's not a laptop.  It's a MacBook.  It's a MacBook. 
[02:02:00]  See, they have cooler names for stuff.  Oh, okay.  A laptop might imply that it's a PC.  Oh, okay.  It's a MacBook.  It kind of opens like a book.  You're back to be smarter than a fifth grader question.  Yeah.  So we're doing MacBook karaoke.  So we've got four finalists here.  Two of these people will win a MacBook today.  Two today.  Yes.  That's exciting.  We've got Emily or Emmalyn, I guess.  Emmalyn?  Never heard of that name before.  Sam, quickly, anything good?

Someone swept your heart away.  From the look upon your face,  I see it's true.  Luke?  So tell me all about it.  Tell me about the plans you're making. 
[02:03:00]  Then tell me once and more before I go.  All right, here we go.  Tell me how am I supposed to live without you?  Now that I've been loving you so long.  How am I supposed to live without you? 
[02:03:30]  A little falsetto.  Oh.  How am I supposed to carry on?  Makes me yearn for the Michael Bolton version.  Michael Bolton.  I celebrate his entire catalog.  What do you think?  What do you think?  The two bobs rule.  Any thoughts?  It's there.  I thought the bass player was great.  It's a contestant.  Yeah, the bass player was the standout.

You have a fine energy when you come in here.  All right, thanks for having me.  Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City for Bill Burr.  I must insist you go see Bill Burr this weekend at Caroline's. 
[02:12:00]  I demand you.  Very funny.  There we go.  That's the end of us complimenting each other.  That's awkward.  Mutual admiration crap.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Astoria.  We've got to fill for like 30 seconds.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, I want to play with what I learned today.  Okay.  I learned that Anthony is less of a queer as I am because I had to go to school to learn  what he did from buying fireworks.  Oh, true.  Yeah, yeah, the gross.  I learned how much gross is from buying illegal fireworks. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, this guy's been holding for two and a half hours.  We only do a three-hour show on this side.  He's been holding the whole time.  Frank in Cape Cod, what do you got for the program?  Hey there, Frank.  Hey, how's it going?  I've been on hold for like two hours.  Actually, it's two hours and 30 minutes.  You guys are great.  You know what?  I said I can't hang up because I got no fucking radio.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, boy.  You listened for that long and didn't realize. 
[02:13:00]  Has the phone been to your ear for the last two hours and 30 minutes?  Yeah, I've been on hold.  I got no radio.  I said, you know, this is cool.  I'm laying here staring at the ceiling and listening to you guys.  You guys are great.  That must hurt your ear.  Was that a cell phone, too?  Cooking your brain for two and a half hours?  Oh, my God.  Were you just laying on the cell phone after a while?  No, no.  I'm just chilling.  Hey, I ate breakfast and everything.  Cool breakfast.  Brung the phone with me all over the house.  Check this out.  Do you listen to the show, though, when you're out?  I run to the car. 
[02:13:30]  I run back in the house.  But you can't listen to us in your house?  You don't have a radio, right?  I don't have a radio, though.  All right, well, listen, Frank, he was on hold for two and a half hours.  I mean, he's got, obviously, something that's so important to the Opie and Anthony show that he would wait that long on a phone.  I want to make sure he was a fan.  Yeah, he's definitely a fan.  Oh, okay.  I got fired for drinking too many 40s.  I was working the ice cream truck.  You know, before I went to work, I drank a couple 40s. 
[02:14:00]  I was about 14 years old.  And the guy I was drinking with was about 76 years old.  You know, and he put salt in it.  Hey, Bill, thanks for helping us out today.  We were talking about getting fired at some point on the show.  Yeah, I got fired.  Okay, what happened?  He's 14.  He's driving an ice cream truck.  He's drinking 40s.  I told him, I missed him.  I got to take a leak.  I'll be right back, Dom.  So I'm taking a leak.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Yeah.  Continue, Frank.  Thank you.  So what's the rest of the story?  Then what happened?  Then what happened? 
[02:14:30]  Then what happened?  See you tomorrow.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:15:00]  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:15:30]  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:16:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:16:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.

[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, he did a great job.  The acoustic version.  Still looking for others to come in.  Yeah.  Is that the name of that song?  Ecstasy of Gold, yeah, from the good, the bad, the ugly. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, the graveyard scene.  Yeah, none good enough to throw on the show before we start XM.  Bob Kelly has joined us.  Bill Burr is here.  We got Big Kev.  We got a lot of people did the walkover today, too.  Hanging.  They're coming upstairs as we speak, so.  Josh Snead swung by.  Who's he?  You're trying to put him over.  I don't know how to put him over.  I had to bring him up.  You know what?  Because he's just fucking sitting out there by himself, and I feel like an asshole. 
[02:18:30]  I love this, though.  Jim Norton started it.  Norton started putting guys over.  Like, we didn't know who Rich Voss was.  And all of a sudden, he'd just be hanging out.  Jim's like, and Rich Voss is here.  Like, Rich who?  He goes, who's he?  Is that how Rich got him?  Yes, and half you guys.  I don't know, you know, each individual story, but.  I met you during your dark period after the church incident.  Yeah, the dark days at the cellar.  Yeah.  And Ovi just sitting there talking about all the reading he was doing.  Bill and I, yeah, we hit it off.  But for the most part, Jimmy brought a lot of the, you know, the guys to the table, 
[02:19:00]  and he would try to put these guys over.  So you're trying to put him over.  Like, what is he about?  I'm just.  I know he's a comedian, because you told me that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's in town.  He did a, not like, he's doing the last comic stand.  He's doing audition.  Very cool.  Okay, how do you know him?  Just from the clubs and stuff?  We did Tampa, the improv.  We did Tampa.  We did Tampa together.  Come on, man, we're veterans.  We're in Tampa.  All right.  The Battle of Tampa.  Am I doing Tampa with that kid, too?  I think I am.  Do you know him?  Bob?  No, I never met him in my life.  That kid.  I don't know.  He looks all right.  I like the shirt. 
[02:19:30]  It's all right.  We talked about that shirt on the other show.  Yeah, but he doesn't have an actual name.  We're talking about those people who look, the hipster kids who wear, like, some blue-collar  guy's T-shirt because they bought it in a thrift shop, like, it's kind of funny.  Like, imagine if I actually worked at a gas station on, like, this fucking loser, whatever  his name is.  It's just like, I just wish they would run into the guy who had that job.  And it was actually his shirt, Mike on the thing there, and he runs into Mike, and it's  like, I worked at that gas station.  What, is Rufin funny to you or something?  Yeah, it's funny.  Beat him with his iPod. 
[02:20:00]  I'm a fashion statement.  You fuck?  I worked my ass off in that stupid shirt.  He smashes him with the thing of tile.  Privileged dick.  Bob walked in and goes, please tell me you guys heard the Lily Tomlin.  Absolutely we did.  Yeah.  You haven't heard the full version.  I heard the guy snapping and going, a cunt.  Yeah.  Which makes Lily Tomlin, I just picture that big chair and her acting like a cutie and some  guy going, you cunt.  Doing her Edith Ann operator. 
[02:20:30]  I just love how the guy.  One ringy dingy.  He snapped, like you snap with your chick, because you can't hit her, because you know  she's got older brothers who get arrested, so you just smash everything around her.  Oh, that's what he was doing, yeah.  You smash everything.  That's what I was saying.  The people that fucking, you know, the set dressers must have just lost their fucking  mind.  The continuity people.  Like, we gotta fucking put the stapler back where it was, and you threw it across the  fucking room.  There was a folder of papers that he flung in the air.  It's like, this is gonna be one of those scenes that keep changing. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, this scene's gonna, this scene's gonna look like there's a ghost in the room.  Yeah, Poltergeist is throwing shit around the room.  I'll start the picture, he goes twisted all of a sudden, all of a sudden.  Lily has a smile in one scene, and then a frown in the next.  Just pissed off at the other.  She looks like someone just called her a cunt in another scene.  I have to watch the scene, dude.  I want to go get the movie just to watch that one scene.  It was on TV last night.  It was on TV last night, and I almost, I almost went to it just based on, I want to  see how, like...  If it's affecting her.  Yeah, if it's affecting her performance, I want to see, like, what scene it was.  I'm flipping through my guy, and I'm like, oh my god, that's the movie we're talking 
[02:21:30]  about today.  I just realized you thought about smashing everything around a girl.  I bet knickknacks have saved more guys from a domestic violent suit.  So just popping her in the face.  I got some bric-a-brac to throw around.  I punched a whole tub of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, and it just went everywhere.  That shit will fucking splatter.  Because, you know, you used to, back in the day, your first couple of girlfriends, you'd  punch a wall, and you're like, and then as soon as you're done, you could see, she just  goes, ah.  How quick do you learn not to do that? 
[02:22:00]  I think every guy has punched a wall where years later, like a knuckle will still hurt.  Oh, yeah.  You go, yeah, that was when I punched the wall because of that bitch.  And you never do it with, like, the Bruce Lee knuckles, the index and the middle finger.  No, no.  It's always like the pinky.  Your pinky ring finger knuckle.  Just so your wrist gets all snapped.  Look at my baby pinky.  One's fat and one's thin.  Fucking bitch.  It looks like Bob has a little experience.  You fucking bitch.  Wham, you hit the wall, and as soon as you hit it, she goes, ah-ha.  What the heck? 
[02:22:30]  Great.  You're like, ugh.  You know what?  I think legally right there, you ought to be entitled just one shot.  A jab.  Just something.  A jab.  You should be able to, listen, you should be able to do UFC stuff.  Like, give her an armbar and make her tap out.  Just make her say something.  Like, you're the best.  You're the best.  You're the best.  You're the best.  You're the best.  And then she tapped him.  You heard it, people.  She said, you're the best.  Let's talk to the winner.  Joe Rogan?  Yeah.  Let's go to George in Jersey.  George.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  I need a favor this morning.  Yeah, it seems like a weird favor, so go ahead. 
[02:23:00]  All right.  My 17-year-old son worships you guys.  He's down in a cooking competition in South Jersey.  Wait.  He doesn't realize that if he doesn't win this cooking competition, he doesn't get scholarship  money, and I spent all his college money on a startup business.  Hold on.  I know he's listening to you.  Wait.  You're...  I need you to put the pressure on him.  Wait.  Your son works for us?  He worships you.  Oh.  Worships.  Worships.  I thought you...  That makes more sense.  Oh, okay. 
[02:23:30]  And what is he cooking today?  Pumpkin bread.  He's baking bread.  Oh, my God.  That's his big shot to get into college.  And there's a competition for baking bread.  Like, how do you know yours is better than everyone else's?  Bet you were hoping for a football scholarship when he was born.  Not a baking scholarship.  Dad, I made a sugar sculpture.  Yes, you did, son.  So, George, when did you realize your son was gay? 
[02:24:00]  Probably.  That's a good question.  Yeah.  God bless you, George.  He just ran right into it.  When he was frosting the Pop-Tarts.  I made Pop-Tarts better.  All right.  Well, good luck with the bread baking.  What's his name?  You don't want the G.I. Joe.  You want that easy-bake oven, huh?  Yeah.  G.I. Joe, though, is so much fun.  Huh?  Just give a little shout-out to Max and South Jersey and tell them to do a good job.  All right.  We just did that.  So, there you go. 
[02:24:30]  Good job.  Thank you, George.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Thanks.  That's great.  Max is crying somewhere.  My dad just did a good job.  Okay.  He has a unique style.  He spits the icing out on the cake.  Oh, God damn.  That's such a weird job.  Like, what word you go by.  If you're a chef, you know, maybe you sound, you sound, still sound like you wear clogs.  But if you're a cook, you're like a failure, and you're making, like, pancakes in a waffle  house.  You're a short-order cook.  Yeah, you're in the waffle house making some slinging hash. 
[02:25:00]  Did you say wear clogs?  Slinging hash.  Yeah.  Like Mario Batali.  Oh, you mean?  I was like, why do you wear clogs?  Mario Batali would like it.  The chef pants that they wear, those colorful.  They used to be called Joey Butterfuoco pants.  But now, for some reason, chefs wear them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Those baggy, colorful pants.  It looks like wallpaper from the 70s.  Yeah, yeah.  They made it into pants.  You know what that is?  That's the convicted felon line cook pants.  Yes, chef.  Johnny L. from New York.  What's up, Johnny L.?  Hey, buddy. 
[02:25:30]  Hey.  A couple weeks ago, my best friend shows up at my house.  He's a knock on the door.  He comes in.  He just got in a fight with his old lady, and his right hand is, like, all swollen and messed  up.  And I'm like, dude, you've got to go to the hospital.  And he says, no, no, no.  He ends up leaving.  To make a long story short, he comes back two days later, and his hand looks like a  black catcher's mitt.  Man, this guy is fucked.  And he says, you know what?  Maybe we should go to the hospital.  So I take him over there.  He gets x-rayed.  His hand's busted in 17 different places from hitting a brick wall.  He's got to have surgery.  Wow.  17, Greg.  17 places. 
[02:26:00]  Smack a brick wall.  That's going to happen.  His hand looks like that chick's vagina.  All right, Johnny L.  You know what?  Oh, sorry.  The fact is, is that you're like, now I'm very careful what I break, but even then you  screw up.  I slammed the cabinet just on the other side.  I just went, you know, fuck you, and slammed just the little baby cabinet.  The other side, the wine rack with five bottles of wine, and every wine glass she has just  went, shoosh. 
[02:26:30]  I like how every fight he has is somehow around the kitchen or there's food.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't believe it's...  I have a one-bedroom.  Dude, I uppercut it.  I have a one-bedroom.  I don't have a house.  Yeah, the living room's in the kitchen as well.  Yeah, I have a see-through kitchen into the living room with the house.  Just to make it appear bigger.  I figured there'd be like a coffee table at some point in the store or something.  Just the kitchen.  End table?  I have a coffee store in my house.  I have one room.  But you realize you're getting maybe a little more mature in your fighting when you grab 
[02:27:00]  something.  You go to throw it, and you look at it and start thinking, I do need this.  This does have a value.  I bought this.  And you're holding it there, waiting to throw it down, and then you just place it back down  and go, fuck, I've got to find something else.  I usually just grab something that I know I can't pick up, like the lazy boy.  And just hold on to it.  And just watch me, like the back of my shirt is splitting.  Like I'm turning into the hole.  Yeah, let your face turn really red. 
[02:27:30]  Just fucking leave.  I've literally said that.  You need to leave the fucking room.  You really do.  Because I will pick this up.  Somehow, even though I'm right, I'm going to be in the wrong.  Yeah.  Because you really do deserve this chair over your fucking head right now.  All right.  Sweetheart.  I actually said, try this.  This actually works.  My therapist gave it to me, and I thought it was gay.  But it works.  Ass sex?  No, wow.  No, I actually went to therapy because of ass sex.  Listen, I actually, I said, you know what?  This sounds so gay, but it works because they don't know what to do. 
[02:28:00]  I go, you hurt me.  You think that's going to work?  It works because they don't know what to do.  You go, you know what?  You hurt me.  And they go, I didn't want to hurt you.  And then it's over.  Well, you did.  How about you hurt me?  Yeah, but now it's emotional.  That's ugh.  Or you hurt me.  Well, I didn't hurt you.  It's your own fault.  If you didn't do what you did, you wouldn't have been hurt.  Who the hell were you married to?  Yeah.  Tell me about it.  Jesus.  Don't even get me married to.  Good answer, Eddie.  I got it.  You just mentioned the word. 
[02:28:30]  It's not a half hour.  You're right.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's not a half hour of uncomfortableness for everybody.  I forget every time.  No, dude, this is like, it was brutal.  I know, I know.  You know, if you break up with a girl, and I thought if you didn't have a kid.  He'll learn something today.  If you didn't have a kid.  Bill's going to teach you what he learned.  This is what I didn't know.  I thought if you were married, okay, and you get a divorce, and you didn't have a kid.  I mean, it cost you a little bit of money, but it was just essentially one level beyond  breaking up with somebody.  I thought because there's no kids.  I've always heard that in bars.  Oh, dude, you're fine.  You're fine.  You're not attached.  He's still paying this girl.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Right now?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No kids, Bob.  And you get.  No kids, no house, no possessions.  He has to go to court.  Didn't have anything good.  Didn't have shit.  He has to go to court in April because they think he's lying about how much money he's  making.  Yeah.  They won the lotto.  She doesn't have a job.  Or a lawyer.  She now wants more.  Yeah.  More.  You know, we're going to see an A&E, an A&E, detectives.  Oh, with what's his name?  Who is that guy?  Anthony was on the radio.  Bill Curtis.  Bill Curtis.  Very successful.  When we come back from the break, we'll tell you how it was done. 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  I'm Bill Curtis.  Exactly.  That creepy voice of his.  I hope he's doing interviews.  I don't know.  He was a great guy.  I mean, we went in every day.  He seemed nice.  He was under a lot of pressure.  He wore a jacket like he was in the movie The Thing every day.  Yeah, it's not that cold in here today.  Yeah, it's not bad.  I take care of it today.  Hey, now we might have to play the Lily Tomlin because, you know, you brought it back to the  table.  You haven't heard it?  I haven't heard it.  And Bob only heard the one clip, right?  Lily deserves it. 
[02:30:00]  We got proof that she deserves what she got from the director.  They all deserve it.  This is Lily in a car.  Jesus.  The scene's not going well.  She's beyond pissed off.  She tells everyone to go fuck themselves, including Dustin Hoffman.  Dustin Hoffman.  Really?  Yeah.  This is what you did in here before the director gave it to her.  Is this on video, too?  It's on YouTube, but they keep kind of...  They keep yanking it.  They keep yanking it.  But it's up there.  You can find it if you're really good at that type of thing or whatever.  YouTube-ing?  Yeah, I know.  It's trying to come up as fuck.  Leave me the fuck alone! 
[02:30:30]  Do you know what the fuck is going on, period?  Fuck you!  I've had it up to here.  Who's reacting to what, for God's sakes?  Fuck you, motherfucker!  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!  Get the fucking thing together, fuck you! 
[02:31:00]  Oh, yeah, bullshit.  She's making some good points.  That's right, we spent five or six fucking hours doing something else.  No!  God damn it!  You fucked it up, god damn you!  Now get straight on and help.  If you can't help them, help me!  That's right, fuck you, too.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm sorry.  You don't get out.  I'll break the fucking set apart.  I don't even give a fuck.  That don't matter, because you're there. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, shut up.  You shut the fuck up, too.  I will, but you're still there.  I will.  Shoot the fucking thing right now.  Yeah, let's see.  Oh, yeah, you'll get all this.  I'll be angry as she's angry.  That'll be good.  Poor Dustin Hoffman's got to deal with that shit.  Can you imagine?  Just shoot the thing.  Just shoot the thing.  Fuck me, fine.  Just like, he was in some of the greatest movies ever.  Oh, the guy legend.  Now he's got to deal with this shit.  I figured Dustin would be like, no, fuck you, bitch. 
[02:32:00]  I'm Dustin Hoffman.  He's a broken man.  Yeah, fuck me.  Fuck me.  It came on.  Fuck me.  He just seemed like, yeah, beaten by her.  Yeah.  Like, she's fucking loud.  He's just, I just want to get this done and get this fucking paycheck and leave.  And the best is they're trying to film a comedy.  Just shoot.  How do you get anything funny after this?  Yeah, but if you ever saw that movie, that movie, like, so doesn't make sense in, like,  so many different ways.  Like, I didn't even fucking get what was going on.  I heard the name and said, this is one of those movies I will never, ever see, just  based on the name alone.  There are movies where, just because of the name.  I wish I had that thought. 
[02:32:30]  No, I never fucking will see that.  I was curious last night.  I almost did it, just because of these clips, but, because I want to see her face, like,  just changing.  Like an Ed Wood fucking movie, just completely different.  The sets change.  Let's shoot this fucker.  Fuck Boris Karloff.  Eddie.  Eddie.  Well, now we got the director giving it to Lily.  Yeah, she's a fucker.  Now it's obvious she deserves it, right?  Yeah, she's a cunt.  Well, that's what he likes to call her. 
[02:33:00]  Fuck you.  I'm just trying to fucking help you.  Do you understand me?  No, no, no.  I'm being a fucking collaborator.  I'm just trying to help you figure out the fucking picture.  Hey, bitch.  I'm not here to be fucking yelled at.  I worked on this fucking thing for three fucking years.  I've got some fucking cunt yelling at me from front of the fucking crew.  Well, I'm trying to fucking help you, bitch.  Figure it out yourself.  Well, I have to figure it out.  Yeah, fuck yourself.  Good.  Why don't you fuck your whole movie?  Why don't you fuck your whole movie?  Because that's what you're doing. 
[02:33:30]  I'll be shutting up.  We better get some George and fucking one more show of them.  Look for him.  Oh, by the way, this is a visual, so he's just losing his mind, and then he walks around the  set, and what, he comes in another door?  That's why you hear him in the background, because he's continuing, but he's now walking  around the set.  He comes in the door like a Carol Burnett show, like it's a skit, because it's part 
[02:34:00]  of the set.  Like he's Kramer.  Yeah, exactly.  He comes in like part of the set.  That's exactly right.  He gets an applause break.  He comes in like Kramer, dude, I swear to God.  So you're just seeing it framed out, you know, the camera, so he leaves and walks past  the camera.  So he's out of the shot.  He left forward, but then he just appears out of nowhere through this door, coming back  in screaming.  He comes out of a prop door, and he says, someone should really just put an applause  break right there.  Oh, an applause break would be great there.  Let me go five cents in here. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, no.  I don't really have to.  Yeah, because you hear him screaming as he's walking around, he gets a little loud, and  the door flies open, and he's full volume again.  But I like, he stuck up for himself.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He yelled at me.  Do this shit fuck you, bitch?  Cunt.  Cunt.  In front of everybody?  Maybe it was supposed to be a really good movie.  He just fucked it up.  He fucked up his dream.  Well, this scene was better than anything in the movie.  They should have just stuck with him.  He tells her to go do a one-woman show.  A one-man show.  You hear?  Go do a fucking one-man show.  That's what she does.  She does one-woman shows. 
[02:35:00]  Rascal from Wisconsin.  Rascal.  Hey, how's it going?  What's up?  Hey, yeah.  I was just wanting to point out that she sounds a lot like that drunk guy yelling at  his cat to get the fuck out of the closet.  I love that video.  Do we have the cat audio?  No.  Have you guys heard the cat audio?  Get down.  What is your fucking...  What are you looking at?  I will end you.  What?  I will play for you.  I will end you.  Now he's just videotaping his cat screaming at him. 
[02:35:30]  The cat's just screaming at his fucking cat.  That's one of the greatest YouTube videos ever.  Cat's just on a TV or something minding its own business or on top of a cabinet.  Cat's horrified.  And he's just yelling.  And he's just screaming.  What are you doing?  Stop.  Get down.  Right.  The cat's literally like just...  And then it runs into a closet and goes, get the fuck out of my closet.  The guy is screaming at this poor cat.  All right, hold on.  Too many things going on.  So here's the director.  He leaves the set and now you're going to hear him come back onto the scene to yell some  more.  He came in the door right there. 
[02:36:00]  So he came flying through the door.  A prop door.  He can't fly through the door, dude.  Slides in just like...  Jerry.  Jeff in Ohio.  Hey, you know, you played this shit yesterday.  Thank you. 
[02:36:30]  Fucking grown up.  Act like a grown up.  You're not a baby.  You're a fucking grown up.  I'm here to fucking help you.  That's all I'm doing is trying to help you get rid of your business.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling before right now.  No.  I never fucking yelled at you.  You fucking told me.  That's a yelling standard for the whole set.  What did he throw there?  There was a lamp.  There was a lamp.  There was a lamp next to the door.  Those clip-on things?  No, it was like a halogen.  Like a small halogen.  Like you'd have it in a corner with a long pole and a light on top, and he just grabbed 
[02:37:00]  it and threw it to the floor.  He fucked that set up so bad.  But you know what's great?  You always hear about like these meltdowns of people tipping over the craft service table.  Yeah.  You know, obviously I've done limited amounts of work, but I've never even remotely seen  anybody just lose their shit.  A complete meltdown, yeah.  Oh, man.  I want to see that.  I just want to see somebody.  That'd be great.  Well, at the end of that clip, you see some kind of production person with a headphone  and microphone, and they're just ushering everybody off the set. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Like you just see crowds of people leaving the set.  Like, okay, take five or maybe the longer people.  Like they know something everybody else doesn't.  Like he's going to kill her right now.  Yeah.  Just let them kill her.  Yeah.  We won't be witness to it.  You know like when a ride is broken at the amusement park and they're like, all right, let's go.  Come on, everybody.  Yeah, everybody's just offline.  Someone just got hurt on the ride.  Nothing to see.  You mean every time I've gone to Six Flags?  What?  Someone gets hurt?  Oh.  I went to the one in Springfield.  I got off the ride, and I stood in line, and maybe for five minutes, stood in line for 
[02:38:00]  the next ride over, and all of a sudden, everyone was getting off the roller coaster.  Basically, what happened was, you know, they're loading one roller coaster as the other one  is just pulling in.  Yeah, rolling in.  When it pulled in, it did slow down, and it rear-ended the other one.  And somebody, like, you know, broke their cheekbone.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  A little whiplash.  Oh, yeah.  All right, listen.  He got stuck on a ride.  It's brutal.  We got the cat yelling guy.  Okay.  You really haven't heard of this yet?  I've never heard of it.  Search this out on YouTube, because it's hilarious, because the cat's expressions, and cats don't 
[02:38:30]  make many expressions, but it's like, what the fuck is this?  You can't get the cat's expressions.  Oh, yeah.  You actually get expressions from a cat, which is really hard to do if you think about it.  Poor little guy.  The eyes just got really big, like, just completely confused.  Yeah, and a couple times, it's like, should I leave now?  And then it would just kind of just stay there.  It wants to dart off.  I feel bad for the poor guy.  Get the fuck down! 
[02:39:00]  Fucking jump!  Jump!  Get the fuck down from there!  Fucking jump!  Jump!  Do it, you bitch!  Do it!  Jump!  Jump!  Do it!  You fucking pussy!  Jump! 
[02:39:30]  Obviously, he's really up high on a cabinet or something.  Really high up there.  Yeah, do we know anything about this guy?  We ever find out any of them?  What is wrong with him?  If he's just goofing or if he's just completely psychotic.  I know, but yeah.  I'm not sure on this one if he's just trying to make, you know, himself famous on YouTube  or if he's getting a little nuts.  Now, that rage, that little, that little, I've had that, that rage where he goes,  ah!  And you can't speak.  You just say, you just scream nothing.  We got more.  Look at me.  Look at me. 
[02:40:00]  Up here.  Up here.  What the fuck are you looking at?  Don't fucking run away from me!  I'll end you!  Where'd you fucking go?  You son of a bitch!  Fuck!  Don't fucking go in my closet!  He sets the cat up! 
[02:40:30]  No, he's like, come here.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  What the fuck are you looking at?  I'll end you.  I'll end you.  The cat runs into his closet.  Get the fuck out of my closet!  Cat tears ass out of his closet.  Doesn't know what to do.  They're shitless.  We got more, Bob.  You are a fucking piece of shit!  I'm going to rape you!  Fuck you! 
[02:41:00]  Run!  Fucking run!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  If he's married, he ever gets divorced,  all I gotta do is just play that.  I'll just show that tape.  Your Honor, you can clearly see this man.  He's not mentally stable.  He's yelling at this animal.  And his lawyer's gonna be like,  he was trying to make something for this website.  YouTube.  It was a humorous piece that he did for a website.  YouTube.  He was going for shock. 
[02:41:30]  Yes, yes.  I'll show you a few other examples of what is on this YouTube  to give you a little context.  Lily Tomlin.  Yes, Lily Tomlin.  Bob, there's the cat way up high.  Well, she is a cunt.  Yeah, there's the little cat.  We're just watching the video.  Poor cat's like a little gargoyle up there.  Yeah, he's just as petrified and being yelled at.  And we got one more clip.  It's quick.  Ah, fuck it.  It's just a cat.  Just be scratching my head.  Don't fucking stare at me!  You fucking bitch! 
[02:42:00]  It looks like it's just a cute cat.  It just wants to be held by Travis in a photograph.  It's balancing on a one-inch piece of wood.  Eight feet in the air.  He's getting away from this psycho.  He went through all the hummels, didn't knock one over.  He knows this crazy lunatic will kill him.  Jesus, man.  That type of rage has to be the funniest rage ever.  We need to know more about that guy. 
[02:42:30]  Let's say hi to Brian in New York.  Brian.  Brian.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  We're having a good time today.  Hi, convertible boy.  Hi.  Drop that bit, thank God.  Yeah, you guys are killing me with this shit, man.  That 911 clip, man, I just want to remind you about that.  And I also wanted to ask you if you guys plan to come to New York for any of that O&A virus  tour in New York State, upstate, maybe Buffalo, Syracuse, anything like that. 
[02:43:00]  I personally want to make sure Buffalo happens.  We're working on it, so we'll see what happens.  I guess our press conference will be April 14th at the Vegas show.  All the info is up on opandathlete.com.  One show on sale right now through Ticketmaster.  Bob's playing Vegas, right?  Vegas, yeah.  Vegas is going to be fun, man.  Hard Rock, right?  Yeah, we've got a nice lineup for Vegas.  I used to do that room at the Beaches.  It's great.  That hotel's retarded.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had a great time doing that show.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Sorry, man. 
[02:43:30]  I told you one, though.  That was the precursor to the Philly boo.  Oh, fuck.  That boo, when I was actually sitting there going, when I left, going, why didn't I just  start trashing people in the crowd?  Yeah.  Yeah, and it was a typical nightmare.  Remember, it was like midgets and people.  There was a seven-foot gay Russian sword swallower that went on before Burr and got a standing  O.  Great.  He's literally seven feet, and he's like naked with his perfect ass showing, and he's  and I really robbed him. 
[02:44:00]  I don't remember that.  Oh, wait.  That wasn't.  That was in my dream that night.  No.  Yeah, it was before you.  They're talking about this call.  We got the long version.  Okay.  Just to bring Bob up to speed, this is the clip everyone's talking about today.  Bob, listen.  Guy kills his wife and then calls 911.  You're about to hear one of the most bizarre 911 calls ever.  67-year-old Freddie Wilhite called police.  He calmly told the dispatcher he shot his wife, and he even confessed why he did it.  This is Freddie Wilhite. 
[02:44:30]  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach, but 38.  Is she still there?  Yeah, she's laying on the floor.  Why did he do this?  She enticed me, and she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  I'll see if she's alive.  Sir?  Is he alive?  Can you believe that? 
[02:45:00]  Yes, I can.  Wilhite surrendered without offering any resistance.  He was charged with murder, and he's being held on $100,000 jail.  I don't know where he goes.  Let me see if she's alive.  It just walks off into the other room.  Are you alive or are you dead?  Or dead.  We got the long version of that call after the break.  She enticed.  He said it like a concerned citizen, though.  Yeah, yeah.  He really did.  Like, he found her.  Let me see if she's alive.  I shot her.  Oh, my God.  She ridiculed me.  Yeah, she just nagged him to the point he had to shoot her in the stomach, shoot her in the guts. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, I think the ignorant way to really look at this is just to say, like, oh, that guy's crazy.  Yeah.  It's like, no.  This is what nagging can drive somebody to do.  That's terminal nagging.  Fatal nagging.  Yeah.  He just got a case.  Fatal.  Terminal.  Fatal nagging.  Fatal nagging.  We should actually come up with a disease called fatal nagging.  Then we should try to get it passed.  Or maybe a movie with, like, Glenn Close.  Yeah.  Fatal nagging.  We could get one with Vanessa Holland. 
[02:46:00]  Just stabbing her with that butcher knife.  All right.  We could get one with a black...  We'll take a break.  Bob Kelly's doing a show on 202 Saturday night.  I was going to say something.  Yeah.  It's all right.  I figured it out.  You get a black girl, do it.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  We'll continue.  The long version of that call after the break.  Presenting Opie and Anthony in-studio visitor guidelines.  Number 37.  Don't fuck the underage drunk guests.  Oh, mister, you're so tall.  Shh.  Not on the air.  Stay tuned for more pearls of wisdom from your pals at the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:46:30]  All right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Bill Burr, Bob Kelly helping us out.  Bob Kelly doing a show on 202 this weekend.  Make sure you check that out.  9 o'clock, right?  Saturday night.  Saturday night.  9 o'clock, 9 to 12.  All right.  We've got to get the long version of this audio clip that we just played before break. 
[02:47:00]  The 911 call.  We haven't heard this yet.  We're going into this cold.  He adds a little something extra.  I guess.  I'm hoping.  A little chit-chat.  Maybe they have the gunshot in this one.  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  Maybe some interaction with the wife and him.  Yeah.  Maybe she answers him about being alive or dead.  Right.  Right.  You clean up this blood.  Oh, how great.  If she's still nagging.  Right.  With a fucking bullet hole.  Just ragging on it.  Yeah.  Don't use that dishcloth.  That's my favorite. 
[02:47:30]  What are you doing?  North Richland Hills, 911.  That's it.  Hello?  This is Freddie Wilhite.  How can I help you?  I shot my wife in the stomach with 38.  What address are you at?  84-32.  Is she still there?  Yeah.  She's laying on the floor.  And what is your name?  Freddie Wilhite.  Where's the gun at?  What?  Where's the gun?  How great is it?  Do you hear the...  She's getting all the info. 
[02:48:00]  What did he say when it first started?  Something like, well, that's that or something?  Well, that's that, yeah.  He's like, oh, that's that.  Yeah.  This is what I've been thinking of doing for two decades.  Well, that's that.  That's that.  Two decades.  Easier than I thought it would be.  Gun at.  Listen.  What?  Where's the gun?  It's in the closet.  What is her name?  Donna.  Is there anybody else there with you?  No. 
[02:48:30]  Okay.  Why type?  Why did he do this?  You're recording it.  She enticed me.  And she would ridicule me throughout my lifetime.  Okay.  And you're at 84-32?  That's it, baby.  I'm going to get somebody.  That's it, baby.  That's it, baby.  Why don't you come on over here?  I think I'm going to be free in about three minutes. 
[02:49:00]  I'm going to tell you something, dollface.  I'm single now.  Might as well start right here.  At the rate she's bleeding out, I should be dating in no time, baby.  I got a 38 for you, baby doll.  You got a sexy voice.  You got about in a match there, baby.  Alls are babies.  That's right, baby.  All right, toots.  Okay.  And you're at 84-32?  That's it, baby.  Okay.  I'm going to get somebody out there.  Where out in the house are you right now?  Well, I'm in the dining room. 
[02:49:30]  I don't know if she's dead or not.  How long ago did this happen?  A few minutes.  Okay.  I'll see if she's alive.  Sir?  You're alive?  You're dead.  What?  He said he shot a wife in a stomach. 
[02:50:00]  You there?  You there?  Sir, I'm here.  I think she's dead.  Okay.  Is there anybody else in the house with you?  No.  A total of four units up there and reduce the rest of the other land.  I'm peaceable.  It's okay.  Okay, sir.  It's okay.  I understand.  I've got help coming up there.  I just want to stay on the line with you until they get there.  Okay, okay.  And then I'll go down.  I'm sorry?  I'll go down. 
[02:50:30]  Okay.  Okay.  You all right?  Wow.  And then he's like, you all right?  I love how they just decide.  All right, yeah.  Send four units up there.  What do they have a chart?  Man.  I'll be peaceable.  I'll be peaceable.  I'll go down.  I might as well go down.  All right.  I'll go down.  Give me a Diablo burger and a Dr. Pepper to go.  Make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry. 
[02:51:00]  Thank you, pretty lady.  Yeah.  Thank you, nice lady.  Yoo-hoo, Cheryl.  You shot your wife in the belly.  How unbelievable is that?  Wow.  She really did nag him to that.  I like how he goes.  He doesn't check vital signs.  You alive or you're dead?  I think she's dead.  Maybe she's unconscious.  I bet he kicked her.  I bet he kicked her right in the side.  Choked her.  Just kicked her and she didn't move.  She's dead.  I aim to kill you with it. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  Let's go to Canada.  Don't go too far now.  We can't shoot a cop.  That's an attention getter.  Yeah.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich or Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  I just shot my wife in the belly.  I shot my wife.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.  I'm a peaceable man.  Harley Fine from New York City. 
[02:52:00]  Kind of sounds like the guy.  I earned that turn.  I shot my wife.  I earned that conviction.  This is the way she wanted it.  Right.  Well, she gets it.  And then someone else, Tom from Maryland, how great would it be if you heard, blam?  Yep.  She's dead.  Just one more shot.  Yeah, one more shot.  One more to the face.  She wasn't there.  She is now.  What did he say? 
[02:52:30]  That little whisper, though?  He said a little...  Stupid.  He said something stupid.  You stupid.  Did you hear that?  Yeah, I wasn't really sure what was going on there.  A little whisper just used stupid.  Is it good?  No.  It's not, right?  Oh, no.  I don't think it's the right one, though.  It's not the right one.  It's him sitting at a desk.  If you see one, him sitting at a desk.  Sam, grab a mic.  No, no, no.  If it's him sitting at a desk.  These guys ranting and raving about Damon Zek for president.  I think he got the wrong one.  Public access show right back in the day.  He might have the wrong clip. 
[02:53:00]  I think he has the wrong clip.  Eight to ten years ago, they were so excited.  They made young Sam run around and find audio.  And Sam has now brought the audio in.  And Sam?  Yep.  Bob Kelly said he wanted the speech.  Billy Burr, too.  Billy Burr, too.  While you came in the office.  I did too try.  You're already bailing on this?  You said you wanted the Damon Zeks for president.  Yeah, but I think we got the wrong one.  Now that I think of it, he has to be at a table.  How do you think he's at a table?  I'm sorry.  Was he waving the flag and he had the Hitler cut?  There's a flag in the background.  Was he sitting?  He wasn't sitting.  And that's not it. 
[02:53:30]  That's not it.  That's not it.  Oh, you guys saw it.  Wow.  So what is Damon Zek all about?  Because now we've got to play this really bad audio.  Oh, God, dude.  You're brought to the table.  Come on.  Everybody has bad.  De Niro has bad movies.  Don't judge this guy yet.  I stand by it.  The guy is fucking funny.  You think he's hilarious.  I'll stand by.  Back to the clip we saw back there?  Yeah.  No, you're not.  You already bailed.  You already bailed.  I'm in.  You tried dragging me into it.  All right.  You showed your colors.  I'm sticking by this.  I'm going to take this fucking thrashing.  All right.  I'm going to put them up. 
[02:54:00]  I intend to put the cards on the table for each and every one of you.  I have smoked marijuana.  I have taken LSD.  I got to see it.  I got to see it.  I have snorted cocaine and enjoyed it. 
[02:54:30]  I have stolen 20 pounds of marijuana and sold it for a profit.  I have taken heroin and LSD for the very same time.  VOTE FOR DEMON FUCKING ZETS!  There you go.  And party your fucking ass off!  Well, no, it gets fun.  No, he goes off. 
[02:55:00]  The one we watch.  Like, I will put a fucking hex on any motherfucker.  He says fuck in the middle of a word.  He goes, eh, fuck, duh.  No, this shit was like we used to come home and watch this guy.  I mean, granted, it was like fucking two in the morning.  We were both passing out, and we would just watch this fucking guy.  You're saying.  And you also got to see it with, like, the makeup.  What a disappointment that was.  It wasn't disappointment.  You laughed.  You got to laugh at the end of it.  At the end, it was good.  Yeah.  If there was no one that started going off. 
[02:55:30]  Also, he polluted your thought, and you went in, and you wanted it to be bad.  You were some shithead with a paperclip sweatshirt on it.  The first part was whatever.  When he started yelling at the end, it was good.  Is that what it is?  Because Jay-Z wore it.  That's not why.  Oh.  That's what you told me.  You said Jay-Z wore it.  That's why you put it on.  Mm-hmm.  Well, then why?  Did Cindy Lopper have it on first?  No.  I said I saw Jay-Z wearing it first.  Not I saw Jay-Z wearing it, and that's why I bought it.  Well, that's not the same thing. 
[02:56:00]  It's the same thing.  No.  It's like if you see somebody wearing something.  First of all, open your mouth when you talk.  It's like if you see somebody wearing something and say, I would like to wear that as well.  You don't buy it because they're wearing it.  No, it isn't.  Because I don't have any other articles of clothing that Jay-Z wears.  No.  No, that's not the same thing.  If you just see some random guy walking down the street, that, shut up.  That is the same scenario.  I'm just saying.  I'm not saying you're right or wrong.  You just used a bad example.  Seeing Jay-Z wear it is different than just seeing somebody wearing it.  He's got a clothing line.  I don't have a single item of his clothing line. 
[02:56:30]  So?  So if I wanted to dress like Jay-Z, why wouldn't I buy his clothing line?  No, no.  I said you bought that because Jay-Z was wearing it.  But why this specific one?  I don't know.  You're the guy who bought it.  I bought it because I like the sweatshirt and Jay-Z was wearing it and that's where I  saw it first.  I'm not buying it.  Jay-Z wears a lot of sweatshirts.  Do you have the money to buy all of those?  No, but this was very late in the game for Jay-Z to be wearing a sweatshirt. 
[02:57:00]  This is a very...  I'm so completely not buying it.  If this is a risky choice, if I just want to say I want to wear a sweatshirt that Jay-Z  wears, this is a very risky choice to make if I don't personally like it, regardless  of Jay-Z.  Safety pins all over it.  Yes, I understand.  It's a ridiculous looking sweatshirt that Jay-Z made look good.  You saw it.  You're like, Jay-Z's cool.  It looks cool.  I'm going to buy it.  You actually just were looking, wow, look at the strings on it.  I think that that would snuggle around my head. 
[02:57:30]  Wait a minute, distraction?  Huh?  I don't want to forget about that bomb you guys brought into this show.  That wasn't a bomb.  Stop distracting.  That wasn't a bomb because you laughed in the end.  At the end.  You got to laugh.  Well, that's not a bomb.  And it wasn't the clip that we...  Most people turned off the channel before they got to the laugh, though.  And it was the wrong clip.  What is this?  Someone's phone.  You never answer the phone in this studio.  It's the hottest hoodie on the street. 
[02:58:00]  Hottest hoodie on the street.  That's what he says.  Fucking parking ticket from some fucking animal.  What happened?  I don't know.  I'll get more info in a minute or two.  Yeah, you don't pay.  Fucking assholes.  Are you going to go back and try to find more audio of this guy?  Good luck.  Now that I argued with the guy who's supposed to help me get the evidence to get me off the hook here.  Yeah, now he's just going to get an even worse clip.  All right?  And I like the hoodie on you, cutie. 
[02:58:30]  Don't get the worst clip.  He means it.  You looked good when you were fighting with Bill Burr.  You held your own.  Keep that in mind.  He really didn't.  He really didn't.  No, he didn't.  He just kept saying the same thing over and over again.  It's like, no, Jay-Z wore it, so now you're wearing it.  And he's trying to make it seem like it was just some random person walking down the street.  Oh, that's nice.  Maybe I'll get that.  Like if he would have just seen a random person walking down the street wearing it, do you think he would have went, I'm going to get that?  Yeah, and his defense was that he didn't own every article of clothing in Jay-Z's clothing line. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  So therefore, obviously, he's a discriminating buyer or whatever the fuck you call it.  Yeah, and that thing cost like 10 weeks fucking salary.  How much did that cost?  He's back.  A ridiculous amount of money for him to spend on a fucking hoodie.  It has to be under 100.  I have an equally ridiculous hoodie.  It's aqua blue.  It's got skulls all over it, and it's flocked.  You've got to dry clean it.  You can't even wash it.  I've never seen a celebrity wear it, and I saw a random person wearing it on the street.  And so I looked it up and found it. 
[02:59:30]  I'm not saying that that doesn't happen.  That's happened to me.  But I never looked at like something Madonna was wearing.  I've got to have that bra on the outside of my shirt.  Uncle Sam's getting braver and braver every day.  I love it.  Go ahead, Sam.  You have the upper lip of a lion, too.  Did you know that?  Did you know that?  Watch The Wizard of Oz and look at the lion.  Look at his upper lip.  You have the same upper lip.  Jesus.  All right, young Sam.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Continue.  I'm just saying that, yes, I saw Jay-Z wearing this hoodie and said, I would like to have 
[03:00:00]  that hoodie.  But that does not...  And it has nothing to do with the fact that Jay-Z was wearing it.  No.  No.  It's not.  I didn't say, I want to get that hoodie because Jay-Z is wearing it.  Now I want it.  Did you just like agree with me and then disagree?  You just said yes.  Why don't you just agree to disagree?  Yeah.  You know what?  Yes.  What happened?  Forget it.  What's going on here?  I don't know what happened.  I thought I was in a debate, and then he agreed and disagreed.  That's his tactic.  I agree.  I disagree.  Don't get nervous, Sam.  It's a good debating tactic.  Stop with your little Chris Rock hands.  Stop playing with your fingers.  Just relax. 
[03:00:30]  He's got them long thumbs.  Say what you want to say.  He's doing very well.  Yeah, he's doing good.  I just want to get nervous.  Go ahead.  Say what you're going to say.  What I'm saying is, I'm a Jay-Z fan.  I saw the hoodie on Jay-Z.  You know what?  I'm in this argument, and I don't even care anymore.  You know what?  You're right.  Thank you.  You're right.  Go get very much.  You didn't randomly buy it.  It totally fits in with everything else that you're wearing and the rest of your wardrobe.  Thank you.  Go get the audio.  We allow one phone call from Canada every day. 
[03:01:00]  This is the one.  It's Veronica.  Veronica, what's up?  Hi there.  I have the news story of the day.  What is it?  I barely heard it this morning, but the gist of it is, a farmer killed his wife with a tire  iron, and he was caught on video saying that he was sorry he didn't make her suffer more. 
[03:01:30]  Wow.  Didn't make her suffer more.  And that's all you know so far?  Yeah.  Well, also, there was, supposedly they had a, the marriage was on the rocks, and because  he got a demon computer and gained weight.  Apparently things weren't going so well.  That's what I want to know is, how does it get to that level where it's like, you know  you're going to jail.  Right.  So why would you just, as bad as divorce is?  Why?  Because that's a better option in your head.  You realize, you know what?  I don't give a shit anymore. 
[03:02:00]  Jail is better than this misery I'm in.  You know what it is?  They probably hear, like, the stories you're telling.  Yeah.  And they're just like, no matter what, I'm always going to have to give them money.  I don't care.  That pride thing.  Fuck that.  But see, here's the difference, and we all, we all feel for Anthony and what he's going  to, right?  But thank God he has enough money to still live a very nice life.  We hear the stories from other guys where she takes so much money that, you know, these  guys are now in a one-bedroom apartment.  They used to have a huge spread in the country, and they get the house, the cars. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, there's got to be, they get everything, and after the alimony payments, and after  the kid support and all that, they're left with nothing for themselves, and they're living  like they're just out of college, when they have a nice life for themselves going on.  Yeah, and granted, women do not make as much as a guy does, but gradually it's getting  closer and closer, but those divorce laws are not changing.  That's what I don't understand.  The same archaic laws that pretty much say women cannot survive without a man, and when 
[03:03:00]  they come out and say, you know, they want all kinds of rights for this, that's fine.  But, you know, equal rights means equal burden, too.  So if a divorce happens, you fucking work, I'll fucking work, and you just get out.  It's like when that Beyonce tune, what is that, independent women, and they all go fucking  crazy.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  You just showed a video of that at your trial.  There you go.  Maybe that would help.  Well, where's this woman?  Where's this independent woman?  Who the fuck?  Yeah.  All right, Veronica, anything else? 
[03:03:30]  No, that's all.  Love you guys.  Punching out.  All right, thank you, Veronica.  Punching out.  She had to say that, because she's in Canada, so they got to say out.  I love that you only take one call a day.  One call from Canada.  One.  We just started that today.  I don't even know.  We might take, Joe.  Yeah, we might.  I usually ruin the bit.  Yeah, I know.  It's just an awful bit, so I figured, what the hell?  You can have that one.  It's just a routine call at a youth basketball game, but there's nothing routine about the 
[03:04:00]  man at the top of the screen protesting the call.  Can you see what he's wearing?  Well, this closer look shows you it's a man in a penguin costume.  And at first, the kids were pretty excited, because they thought it was a mascot.  But that idea, Chris Dowell says, went south when the man began verbally assaulting the  young players, even cheering when they fell down.  Where's Norton?  Was Norton doing a gig somewhere?  In a fucking suit.  That's hilarious.  The guy in a penguin suit, they thought it was a mascot, then they realized that they  were the Rams.  And that's when they realized, wait a minute. 
[03:04:30]  What the fuck is a penguin doing?  It's youth basketball, so they're really young.  And they're excited.  They think it's the mascot.  Oh, my God.  They got together.  And he's laughing when they fall down.  And he's mocking, yeah, and heckling of these just young kids trying to play basketball.  What a little up.  What if he's doing it in the penguin, like, yeah?  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  And heckling.  This stupid little kid, like he fell.  Wah, wah, wah.  There's more to the story.  Dowell, a coach on the team catching the abuse, says the man in costume is a league referee  who often let games get too rough. 
[03:05:00]  Dowell filed a complaint late in the season, and the referee wasn't assigned to any more games  involving his team.  Perhaps that's why, once the man was kicked out of the gym on Saturday, he served up choice  words to Dowell, who was standing at the end of the bench.  He made some comments to me that shouldn't be said around kids.  The city's investigated the incident, so there are no judgments yet of what happened in this  gymnasium, but there will be a guiding principle.  The bottom line is here that the leagues are for the kids, and we're here to provide for 
[03:05:30]  them and protect them if need be.  Protection, even if that man you see in the door wearing the penguin suit was joking or  not.  That's just fun, dude.  I would laugh, so if I saw a dude in the pen, going, ah, you suck, you little rug rat.  You little brat.  How to be drunk.  How little kid falls.  You drop the ball, faggot.  Dude, that's just another one of those, like, how do you arrive at that moment? 
[03:06:00]  Like, literally, I can see just flipping out, driving up there.  Fuck you, this guy went somewhere.  Where would you get a penguin suit?  He tried on costumes and decided, in his dopey brain, that the penguin suit would be  the best one for the job.  Not a moose, not a moose.  Moose is not the vibe.  Tries on a rabbit.  Your mother.  Let's see.  A penguin.  A rabbit's too cute.  Right.  He goes, yeah, a penguin is perfect.  Penguin's perfect.  How much is that?  Do you take credit?  That probably came into play.  Credit cards, right?  Huh?  You wanted to be a lion, but it was too much money.  I didn't try it there. 
[03:06:30]  How much for the penguin?  $3.50 for the lion's suit.  Fuck, I can only afford the penguin suit.  All right.  It was either that or be Captain Jack Sparrow.  Right.  Ah, lass.  He drove there, though, like, with that in his head.  Like, he didn't just end up there in a penguin suit.  You think he put it on the parking lot or he actually had the bottom half of the suit  on in the car?  And just the head next to him on the passenger seat.  In a bag and he goes into the bathroom and changes, puts his regular clothes in the vent 
[03:07:00]  in the ceiling.  I don't know.  And at no point is there a voice in the head going, dude, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Just because of the penguin.  Let it go.  Let it go.  So you can curse it, little kid.  In his mind, it all makes sense.  Youth basketball.  This was his moment.  I need to do this.  Cut to him later in a motel room with a hooker and a bottle of gin.  She's wearing the hat.  She's wearing that penguin head.  She's gutted on the bed.  Oh, Jesus.  That'd be great if he called in for that life-changing moment.  If he called the morning of that.  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you about me doing?  Put on a penguin suit.  Scream an eight-year-old. 
[03:07:30]  Sure you are.  Eight-year-old's on a penguin suit.  I'm fully armed, too, but I'm not sure if I'm going to shoot yet.  I just want to protect myself.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Yeah.  Hey, Steve.  What's going on, bros?  What's up, buddy?  Oh, I just wanted to tell...  I wanted to send a nephew out to my freaking ex.  Gave her a million brand new car.  Paid off the freaking house.  Paid for her education.  And I had to live in a basement apartment for a year.  And I still don't have a freaking divorce decree. 
[03:08:00]  Thank you.  Bye-bye now.  And see you later.  That sounds wonderful.  Say he's angry.  That's the people I really feel sorry for.  I do feel sorry for you.  Yeah, but he sounded like he was at the end.  He went...  No, but he's lost everything.  He had a great life and obviously making good money and he lost it all.  I remember what.  He's still not good enough.  Yeah, and if you leave, there should be definitely some sort of...  But it should be more equal as far as...  Yeah, please.  You know what sucks is that it's always the case when the girl...  The next guy the girls meet doesn't have as much money as her and he's living off of 
[03:08:30]  your money.  He's using some of your cash to go to the movies, to get a new jacket.  Yeah, she can do whatever she wants with it.  To pay the bills.  Yeah.  When he wanted internet, Wi-Fi in the room.  I got it.  Don't worry.  No, really?  Anthony has it.  Yep.  They're almost like enticing them to go out and meet a loser.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Meet a loser with a big cock?  That's all you need.  You don't need a fucking breadwinner.  I love that.  How long's your cock?  That's all she's got to fucking ask anybody.  Listeners really helping out. 
[03:09:00]  I got to interrupt.  Hackett from D.C.  Video of the penguin guy.  Got the link.  Got to see what this guy's all about.  When I was a little tater, of course, my parents got divorced.  And I remember the first time I went over to Dad's place after the divorce, it was just  the worst.  He was living in like this little apartment and it was decorated with like shit I think  I made in school at the time. 
[03:09:30]  So it was like a little clay dinosaur that I had made and that.  Yeah, he was doing great.  And he's like fucking chick.  Some chick would come out and she's drunk and half naked.  Ah, this is your boy.  Like guys just using this as a fuck pad.  It's like out of a fucking short Reynolds movie.  Oh, it was awful.  Like he comes out wearing a penguin suit.  Yeah, penguin suit.  But it was just like, oh, look, now he's got to live in there.  Look at this little kitchenette.  He had like a kitchenette. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  With those half a stove.  Yeah, it's half a stove and a sink that's like fucking six inches by six inches.  Yeah, it was just two little.  Single file burners.  Two single file burners.  You can make soup.  And coffee.  That's it.  A little refrigerator.  It was tiny.  And I was a little kid at the time.  And even I realized it was little shit.  Did you have a percolator?  Yeah, probably a percolator.  But it was just the smallest place.  And it's like, oh, you don't live in a nice house.  How come we live in the house?  And you live in this place, you know? 
[03:10:30]  Oh, because your mom's a bitch or something, you know?  You know, they always try to kind of pawn it off on the other one.  I don't mean to laugh at it.  I'm sorry.  Than is giggling over here.  It's a huge penguin suit.  It's not even an in-shape penguin.  Dude, he's just standing up.  There's not many people in the stands because it's youth basketball to begin with.  He's real obvious.  It's going to be a little while now?  All right.  Yeah, it's very obvious.  He just stands up and...  Go ahead, Dan. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, it's like...  It's going to take a second.  Yeah, it's like a tiny high school gym.  So there's 20 people in the bleachers' tops.  And this one guy in a penguin suit.  I'm fucking thinking.  It's not like he'd be hard to spot.  This is going to be great.  Here's the question.  Why didn't one of the fathers just, you know, take him out?  Because he's the mascot.  Knocked out penguin, man.  You really can't fight a mascot.  For one thing, if he's tough and you get your ass kicked by a penguin...  Yeah, then you look real bad.  I ran into that on that tourgasm when I was going to fight that turtle. 
[03:11:30]  I was like, you know what?  Do I really want to roll around with the guy in a turtle suit?  Right.  Because if he beats my ass, it's me getting my ass kicked by a Muppet.  It's the no-win scenario.  Here we go.  Here's the video.  All right.  So, a kid just fell down and now the penguin stands up and he's like...  Was he pointing at him and laughing?  Yeah.  With his little penguin hand?  Can we link this, TopeyandAnthony?  Sure.  Dot com?  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  What was the guy thinking?  Look at him.  And he's fucking zero.  Dude, that's fucking...  He's right in the middle of the crowd.  It's an oversized penguin suit. 
[03:12:00]  These kids are so little.  It's youth basketball.  You know what?  That's like 12-year-olds.  Now, having seen this, this guy's a genius.  I take back everything that I said.  You like him now?  Oh, he's great.  And he didn't bother with the mask part of the penguin suit, either.  Oh, he didn't have the top.  No, the head's off.  He wanted to not preserve his anonymity.  No.  He's a headless penguin mocking children.  That's funny.  And reminding us of global warming.  Right.  This guy's on a couple of different fronts here.  That's what it is. 
[03:12:30]  All right.  And now we've got to move to what Anthony was talking about.  We've got Brother Joe on the line.  He wants in on the conversation.  Brother Joe.  Ah, Joe.  Married for two years and nine months and made to live at my sister's house for almost  three years following-  Oh, you're going-  Oh, I thought you were going with your father, but you're going with your own divorce story.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Two years and nine months, man.  And I ended up living at Dawn's house for three years until the divorce was finalized.  And the reason I wasn't allowed to be in my own home that I was paying the mortgage on, paying 
[03:13:00]  all the utilities, and paying for the fucking dog food was that she whacked herself in the  head and had me removed by the police.  She whacked herself in the lip and made herself bleed, and the cops came and arrested me.  I've never laid... 
[03:13:30]  Guys, you really don't know me from a hole in the wall, but ask Ant.  I have never and would never lay my hands on a woman.  The story's a little better, brother Joe.  You guys are fighting, and she goes, well, watch what I do now.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, we were arguing.  I mean, you know-  They were arguing, and she couldn't get the upper hand, so she picks up the frying pan  right in front of Joe and just starts smacking herself.  And whacked herself in the head.  And I was like, you know, you're fucking crazy.  And I walked outside, and I'm sitting at the curb smoking a butt.  Next thing I know, cops coming up from behind me and going, Mr. Cumia, we have to place 
[03:14:00]  you under arrest.  There was a court order.  It was...  What did they call it?  Contempt of court.  And did you say it all?  No, she just did that to herself.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, no, it doesn't matter, man.  The cops look at that, and they say, you know, they say, I have an order from the court  stating that if anything happens in this household...  My lawyer told me, stay out of the house.  And then at the same time, they tell you that you have to be there to lay claim to the  house, or it's like abandonment. 
[03:14:30]  And so you end up there and placing yourself at risk for getting thrown in jail, and that's  exactly what happened.  She followed her lawyer's advice to the T.  I won't mention the fat fuck's name, but she followed his advice to the T.  And was his advice to smash yourself in the face, or did she come...  Oh, yeah, to get me out of the house.  That's the only way.  Otherwise, in the lawyer's words, he can come in there, he can bring a girl in, he can do 
[03:15:00]  whatever he wants to do.  What kind of a man would tell a woman to do that to another man?  You know what?  A lawyer.  Yeah.  A lawyer.  Fuck.  That's not a man.  I know.  Joe, that's because of what O.J. did, that's why the cops have to just arrest you now.  They can't even mess around.  Well, this was prior to, no, it was after O.J., but that really doesn't matter.  New York State sucks, man.  If the woman says, he threatened me, he verbally threatened to kill me, and there's a, you know, 
[03:15:30]  like, Jesus Christ, I'm going to fucking kill you.  Just like, you know, a comment in passing, just fucking around.  That's it, man.  You get arrested, put in jail, and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, it sucks.  So don't get hurt.  Did it make you want to just get the frying pan and go, all right, well, if I'm getting  arrested, smack her in the head anyways?  Yeah, you know, I mean, it makes you think that way, but, you know, I'm not like that. 
[03:16:00]  You know what it is.  There were 20 guys in the holding cell out in Suffolk that were all there for criminal contempt  for the same thing.  I think two of them were there for, like, shoplifting, one for a Dewey, and 17 guys  that were all in because their wives called the cops while there was an order of protection.  And order of protection is SOP these days for a divorcing couple that has any kind of arguing 
[03:16:30]  going on, any type of, you know, disagreement when it comes to the settlement.  Yeah, they automatically throw an order of protection on, and then the cops can come  and just haul you away.  But you know what it is.  You get a story like the other day where that woman had an order of protection, and she was  raped by that guy.  And the guy came back and slit her throat because she was going to testify against him.  You know, the women are the ones that are victimized.  You know, that's why, that's why, that's why, no matter what happens, you're going to jail. 
[03:17:00]  The authorities would rather err on the side.  This is what you do.  Before you're going to, you're going to break up with your girl.  You go down to the spy shop, and you get some sort of shades that have like a camera in it.  Not, not a bad idea.  The Moe Green glasses?  Yeah.  Hey, draw chips for everybody.  Why are you wearing those glasses?  You know who I am.  I'm Moe Green, and I'm breaking up with you.  I'm going to go out with some dances that'll kick your teeth.  Yeah, and then literally, then you can literally howl with laughter as the girl you fucking hate 
[03:17:30]  now is smashing her own face in with the front pin.  Could you do that again?  Will I really get a good focus on this one?  You think the cops are really going to buy that, huh?  I actually had a neighbor across the street, this woman that the ex used to talk to all  the time, that the ex-wife admitted to this woman that she had whacked herself to get me  out of the house.  And it was tens of thousands of dollars later, I ended up having the case overturned. 
[03:18:00]  I was convicted.  I was told I had to go through anger management courses, that I had community service, all  kinds of shit.  And the fucking DA, man, the dyke cunt, the DA, sorry, that convicted this case, that  convicted me, was like, wouldn't hear a fucking word I or my lawyer had to say.  I mean, it was fucking so one-sided. 
[03:18:30]  Oh my God, I would have gone nuts.  It's always, it's always one-sided.  I would actually, I'd be one of those guys who, I have a temper, I'd probably lose it.  I'd do something, if I knew I was going, if she did something like that.  And you knew that it was bullshit?  I don't know.  I don't know how you just sit there.  So the thing got overturned.  Now, do we have any charges brought up against her for lying?  No, no.  Of course not.  You can just fucking get away with anything.  I was absolutely immune from prosecution having anything to do, they were able to overturn  the case and throw everything out.  I actually accepted an ACOD, which is like not an admission of guilt, but basically saying 
[03:19:00]  that you'll stay out of trouble for six months and everything goes away.  See, I almost bought a ninja suit just because of this.  I'm not even kidding you.  I've actually been this close to buying a ninja outfit for less than this.  If my girl, I would just gear up.  I wanted to just go hide behind a tree at like, and just fucking beat the fuck out of  him.  Just jump out and fucking beat the shit out of him.  Well, I wrote, I wrote a song that was legendary. 
[03:19:30]  I know the cunt song.  I thought that was Anthony's.  Ah, that was his.  Why don't we play that going in a break?  That was a good one.  All right there, Joe.  I'm on my way back from Massachusetts.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  All right, man.  There you go.  I forgot about that one.  Oh, yeah.  He sheds a whole new light on the OJ case, huh?  Yeah, a little bit.  Danny, you got it?  Paying for the house.  He's banging that fucking young dude.  Yeah.  Why don't we play this as we go to break?  I'm just saying, it's like that Chris Rock pick.  I'm not saying it's right, but I understand.  All right, right. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  C is for the way you crap on me.  U is cause you're ugly and so's your peach.  And, but no, I never told you that I railed your sister.  T, thanks for the Hummers. 
[03:20:30]  They were better than your mother's.  Cunt is all you'll ever be.  It's true.  Cunt, you must be more than one.  Cunt is for castration. 
[03:21:00]  Try that on me.  Hey, hey, you.  Well, I urinate and have a shot.  It's free.  Cunt is for some big negro tearing up your leather cheerio team.  You friggin' twat know you will never be forgotten.  Cunt is all you've ever been to me. 
[03:21:30]  A cunt and a really big one.  And all my friends are green.  You're that slang word for vagina.  Can't describe you any finer.  Cunt, the word's just right for you.  Whoa, cunt.  The word was made for you.  And I've been rooting up about my cunt.  The word is made for you. 
[03:22:00]  All I want is to get laid in these sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy.  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when you want to change the locks?  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you, you help me, we all laugh.  Don't worry, we're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweetie.  If you walk past them, it's all my tickets to where you take your purse or whatever, you know.  You have no idea what they are. 
[03:22:30]  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Freaky night.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show?  Okay.  Rock. 
[03:23:00]  I'm telling Bobby about, he moved into my neighborhood.  I'm not going to say where, but we're talking about this gym he wants to go join.  He's like, does he have a steam room?  A steam room?  Why don't you worry about just the workout equipment first, and then the steam room second.  He's already talking about where he can just sit down, sit with naked gentlemen.  I just want to, no, I want to test myself. 
[03:23:30]  I want to sit in there and put a towel right over my little pay you and see if it, just concentrate and see if it, just to make sure it doesn't stick up.  I don't shower in like those gyms, man.  No.  I have to.  Even if people wear like the flip-flops and shit.  No, it's just musty and fucking wet and just bacteria.  You just know bacteria.  That's like the fucking Caribbean for bacteria.  They go there to vacation.  It's so beautiful.  Like the conditions are perfect for them. 
[03:24:00]  There's AIDS on a float with a margarita.  Margarita.  They're just loving life.  It's like, you know, the bar that's in the pool.  They're just sitting on the stool.  They're just sitting on the stool, pissing in the water.  They don't care.  Herpes is jet skiing.  Yeah.  They're all just having a blast.  Athletes' foot fungus all over the beach, sunning.  They don't care.  That fucking shower.  It just got that stink smell of men.  Hepatitis in a hammock.  You don't want to fucking be in the locker room.  And then I love how they always have like those three awful plastic dispensers like conditioner, shampoo, body lotion, body soap. 
[03:24:30]  It's all made by like DuPont.  It's like Agent Orange you're fucking putting in your hair.  Semen.  Yes.  One just filled with semen.  Yeah, just in case there's no other guy's there and you want to pump some into your mouth.  That is awful.  And they got an extension and you just plug right into your ass.  Just punching, punching the button.  Squick, squick, squick. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, that is just awful, those gyms.  You just go work out.  I don't care about the drive home if I'm, you know, sweating.  And then you get home and you shower when you're home.  Can I tell you what?  They're standing there in the nude.  They're shaving and shit.  Like we talked about a naked guy at the gym shower.  I don't get that.  You just don't work.  I'm getting my bathroom.  They're demoing my bathroom.  I'm not going to have a bathroom for three weeks.  So I have to join a gym in the area.  So I wake up and I'll kill two birds with one stone.  I'll go work out.  Are you kidding me?  I'll go in the steam room and I'll take a shower. 
[03:25:30]  You're kidding me, right?  They're demoing my, what am I going to do?  Where am I going to take a shower?  My shower is going to be like they're knocking.  They're literally going in and ripping out the entire bathroom.  I'm not buying into this.  Swear to God.  Where's your girls?  Where's your girl showering?  Well, she works at a gym.  She works at Equinox.  And that's a fancy, fancy gym.  So she works every day.  So she's just going to go to the gym and shower.  Your girlfriend working at a gym.  She does an esthetician.  She does pussy waxing and zit peeling. 
[03:26:00]  She does.  And she tells me about horrid pussies.  She talks about...  Oh, we've got a pussy picture for you.  Maybe you can help us.  What do you mean?  This is one of the most perfect pussies I think I've ever seen.  I actually have.  I have.  Like, you know, like those odorless, just gorgeous fucking pussy.  Check this out.  Odorless?  I'm going to look at it.  Why are you saying...  I know you're lying because you just said odor.  You used the wrong fucking sense, you ass.  Bobby, I wouldn't lie.  No, no, no.  I'm saying like...  He used the sense that you don't use when you look at a picture. 
[03:26:30]  Unless it was a scratch and sniff.  Wait till you see this odorless.  Bob, you've got to trust me on this one.  Have I ever lied to you?  Yes.  My whole body language, I'm not even looking at him.  I know.  His head's sunk into his shoulders.  You completely look like you're lying.  That's great.  It's odorless.  You can't even hear it.  It's an odorless picture.  All right.  I'm finding it here.  Yeah.  I'll be scrolling.  Yeah, my girl talks about...  Look under a cancer box.  Yeah, now we can say a cancer box.  My girl turned me on to this.  We're trying to figure out what's going on here. 
[03:27:00]  It's Janice Dickinson, the ex-model.  I think she was one of the first supermodels.  Janice...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, she was on a real life.  Her pussy looks like if you punched Nipsey Russell right in his mouth.  All right, here you go.  Nipsey Russell, have you punched me in the mouth?  Yeah, here you go.  This is what his...  By the way, my girl was convinced that this was the lips.  I forgot to mention this on the first half of the show.  What do you mean was the lips?  And now I had to tell her I think it might be the crotch of the pantyhose.  Click on it.  Click on it.  It makes it bigger.  Oh, really?  I think so. 
[03:27:30]  That's what Eric said.  You got it.  You lost it.  No?  Okay.  That.  What do you think is going on there?  What the fuck is going on there?  She's getting out of her car, so the paparazzi get the oopsie shot of her crotch.  It's like she's got fucking emo mascara around her pussy.  No, all that is is the nylons.  She's wearing nylons.  That's all it is.  It's nylons.  She doesn't have...  It's not all it is.  It does look like it could be something.  What about it?  It's nylons.  Dude, those are nylons because she can see on her knee she has fishnets on.  There she's got fishnets.  And up there, the crotch, that's there to hold a fucking tampon. 
[03:28:00]  That's what that is.  It looks like her fucking...  Dude, unless...  How would that hold a tampon?  Unless her pussy got frostbite.  That's what we were saying before.  Yeah, that's what we were saying.  No, that's just the...  Sat down, passed out on a block of dry ice one night.  And you know what?  In defense of her, if her pussy did look like that, she'd definitely be wearing panties.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Boxers, I would think.  Yeah.  That's just to hold the tampon.  All right.  That's the nylon.  That is the fucking...  The shot of the 2000s. 
[03:28:30]  That is, like, going to be the shot of the fucking 2000s, is girls getting out and flashing  their snap.  How are they going to beat this?  They'll probably, like, have gaping shots.  I think gaping asshole shots.  F-caves.  Where they actually crawl out of the limo backwards on their hands and knees with their ass taken  up.  Spreading their ass cheek.  So the camera just gets a fucking close-up of their...  Their ass round eye.  Yeah.  The inside.  You got to be...  Yeah.  It's got to be a gaping. 
[03:29:00]  All right.  That's the only way it could go.  You have to see a vein.  They had MTV cribs.  You have to see a vein pulsing in her asshole muscle.  Did you...  I thought you were going to show me, like, that stalactite disease, that dick disease.  What is that?  Awful.  That disease that all guys have.  They don't know they have it, and they give it to girls.  They get cancer and die.  HPV.  Yeah, dude.  Do you ever see...  Google...  Image Google HPV, and look at what happens to your car.  Oh.  Can I tell you something?  This is bringing flashbacks of when me and Bob lived together, and he used to look at 
[03:29:30]  horrific shit on the internet.  Dude, I don't want to see this shit.  Yeah, and he knew it would fuck me up.  What's wrong with you?  This is what he used to do.  Don't Google HPV at home.  It's stalactite cock.  Two, four, six.  The first ten pictures are just beyond horrific.  It looks like the thing's cock.  But this is what...  Holy...  That could happen to your...  Oh, God.  Stop it.  That's it.  That could happen to your cock.  Yeah, dude.  And you don't even know how to have it.  It looks like a boa.  It looks like bread that you left out too long. 
[03:30:00]  Dude, I can't even look at it.  I can't look directly at it.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, wow.  What are you going to do?  You guys can probably just look at it.  How long did...  You know how many other things there ought to look at?  No, somebody told me about this disease that, like, one in three guys have.  One in three guys have cauliflower dick.  You know, that's if you let it go.  Oh.  That's just...  It's if you let it go, it turns into...  Who would let it get to that point?  Yeah, apparently.  He doesn't really know anything about it.  No, he doesn't.  He has barroom medical...  Yeah, absolutely. 
[03:30:30]  Barroom doctor.  Yeah.  If you let it...  Because I've heard conflicting shit...  Well, what the fuck do any of us know about anything, really?  Dr. Blobby.  Who the fuck is an expert on anything in this fucking room?  You're scaring people right now.  Just saying...  What are you an expert on?  One out of three...  The fact that I don't know shit.  All right, well...  All right, listen.  No, but he used to do that shit when we used to live together.  I'd be watching TV.  I remember that.  And he would be sitting there with his laptop, and he would just Google some horrific fat...  Just awful shit.  And then he'd just turn the laptop around.  And I'd be sitting there watching TV, like...  And he'd just be like, hey, Burr. 
[03:31:00]  And I would just look up...  I was just like, some old lady's awful picture.  But one time...  You know what he did?  It was a picture of an old lady's vagina.  It was just hanging like it was melted.  And I was trying to get Burr to look at it, and he just said, no.  No.  And he wouldn't look at it for like days.  I kept trying to do it.  Look at this.  No.  You're not fucking getting me anymore.  I'm still mad about that.  I still want to show Burr that old lady vagina that was sagging.  Next time you guys are in together, we'll figure it out.  Let's say hi to Steve in Mississippi.  Steve.  He's not going to faze me. 
[03:31:30]  Steve?  Steve.  Steve.  Mississippi.  Steve?  Hello?  Hey, you're the guy.  What's up, Steve?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  My phone cut out.  I thought you hung up on me.  No.  You're on.  You're on the air.  What do you got?  I just want to give you all one of the stories, basically getting raped by my ex-wife.  After, I guess, 13 years or 12 years after the divorce, when Hurricane Katrina came through,  I lost everything I had.  And I guess you realize I lost on my record of child support. 
[03:32:00]  She actually took me to court and sued me for 12 years back, child support and medical money.  And you couldn't prove that you paid.  I could not prove that I paid anything.  Don't someone else have records?  Someone else would have.  Yeah.  Didn't someone else have records?  No, because my lawyer's office, I mean, you know, we had just about my entire county was wiped out by the storm.  Yeah, but what about the checks that went to her?  Weren't there canceled checks? 
[03:32:30]  If she had those, you know, she didn't take them in there and I couldn't.  I've been through some of the banks.  No, you'd have them because they were yours.  Yeah, they're your checks.  You know, after five or six years, the banks don't even have copies of that down here no more.  What?  You know, so I couldn't even get them.  I'm kind of believing it, but I'm gullible.  I wouldn't.  Yeah.  So what were you left with?  Well, when we got divorced, I gave her everything.  And then after the storm, the only thing that I had was one car, my kids, and the clothes I had on my back, which were my uniforms for work, and I lost my job, too. 
[03:33:00]  Wow, that blows, man.  It's just a lovely story.  Did the dog die, too?  Yeah.  Wow.  My clothes went to Goodwill.  You're primed for a country song.  They took it off?  No, she dropped them all off.  She burnt all my stuff in a fireplace and then dropped all my clothes off at Goodwill.  And this is the thing.  If you did, if you started burning her shit up, you would be in jail.  They can hit you.  They can do whatever the fuck they want.  And it's just, I don't know.  I don't get that. 
[03:33:30]  No.  That, like, immune to law, like mob wives, like whenever the mobster gets busted, they can always just play out.  I thought he was a banker.  I had no idea.  I didn't know.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Yeah.  You know what he's doing.  There's guys, there's laws for men, too, but you look like a fag when my wife hit me.  You know something?  I would look like a fag then because if there was any recourse, there's none.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The slow clap.  I love the slow clap.  Thank you. 
[03:34:00]  Let's say hi to Drew in Baton Rouge.  What's up, boys?  What's up, Drew?  Love the show.  Obviously, just getting it down here on XM.  Cool.  But I've got one problem, and that is whenever it's anybody but Borton or Patrice sitting in, they overrun the show, and I cannot hear the reason I listen to the show.  Billy Burr and these guys, man, they just run and run and run their mouths. 
[03:34:30]  I keep billing.  We had a great show today, sir.  Bill and Chuck, it's a talk show, you idiot.  We're talking to each other.  We move on to other things, but he wants to say too much Bill and Bob, not enough O&A.  Dude, we have to do 25 hours of radio a week.  We look forward to the days where we can maybe sit back a little bit.  You're right.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  And I'm actually one of Bill's cronies.  I'm not even me.  Yeah.  He goes, Bill and his little things.  Would you call me?  They're right.  Drew, this is a bitch of a thing we have to do every week. 
[03:35:00]  I've been yapping all day.  Yeah, I think so.  Jesus.  We're in there.  I like this guy.  I'm going to shut up.  Yeah, I'm shut up, too.  I'm not going to talk to you.  No, Drew, you're right, Drew.  We're done.  I'm not going to talk to you.  Drew, I'm sorry.  I offended you.  Enjoy the rest of the show, Drew.  What a tool.  We've got to do 25 hours a week.  We need the help.  All right.  Enough.  Fine.  I'll stop talking to you.  Don't talk yet.  But I like talking.  It's a talk show. 
[03:35:30]  We've got one more thing to do.  Another 911 call.  We were supposed to play this yesterday.  I don't think anything's going to beat the guy shooting his wife.  No, that's the big one.  Listen to this.  Black woman calls 911 on her son.  Tells operator they better send somebody quick because she's going to kill the motherfucker with a hammer.  Oh.  Oh.  Listen to that, man.  What emergency?  I need an officer at my house at 4315.  Tell me what's going on.  My son is disrespectful. 
[03:36:00]  He stole my car on Sunday.  He was the officer called me and told me my car was stolen.  He's not coming home from school.  He's just not getting in it.  He's supposed to do volunteer work at the band.  I'm worried sick to death.  He's disrespectful.  I need an officer out here before I be committing to 187 because I'm about to kill this little bitch.  Ma'am, how was your son?  He's 15.  Right?  And if I don't get it, I'm going to kill this motherfucker with this hammer.  And I swear to God, if you don't send a motherfucker out here, I'm going to basically blow up, spatter, 
[03:36:30]  every motherfucker will be an OJ Simpson in this motherfucker's house.  I need an officer, and I need him out here quick.  I'm going to commit to beat his motherfucker's ass, and I hope you recorded everything that I'm saying because I'm sick of a bitch.  Yeah, fuck that.  Huh?  We need the uncensored version.  We're over at XM.  Yeah.  Here it is.  Again, sorry about that.  I need an officer at my house at 4315.  Stay on line.  I need an officer.  Jimmy, what's going on?  My son is disrespectful.  He stole my call on a Sunday. 
[03:37:00]  He was officer calling me and telling him my call was stolen.  He knocked him off before.  He just knocked him in.  He's going to do volunteer work at the band.  I'm worried sick to death here.  Disrespectful, motherfucker.  I need an officer out here before I be committing to 187 because I'm about to kill this little bitch.  Ma'am, tell us your son.  He suits me.  Right?  If I don't get it, I'm going to kill this motherfucker with this hammer.  And I swear to God, if you don't send a motherfucker officer out here, I'm going to be bored, scattered, every motherfucker.  There's going to be an O.J. Simpson in this motherfucking house. 
[03:37:30]  I need an officer, and I need him out here quick.  I'm going to commit to beating his motherfucking ass, and I hope he's recording every fucking thing that I'm saying.  I'm going to be tired of the motherfucking.  Ma'am, what's your name?  Monica Wilson.  Okay, do you have a hammer with you?  I have a hammer with you, sister.  I can't wait.  You're on your motherfucking hand right now, you little bitch.  Okay, can you put the hammer down?  I take me your hammer down.  Get the way you fucking have to kill me out here.  When I want to try to move on, I'm going to be living in a motherfucking kid and get me in jail. 
[03:38:00]  What's that?  Put me in jail.  I'm about to beat this brain out.  I'm bored, never got a precious motherfucking ass out.  Okay, listen.  You're on your ass right here, or I'm going to kill this motherfucker.  and I think I'm better  who I'm lonely.  Listen.  Hey there.  Wow.  Hung up on that bitch.  By the way,  Fast Brady from  Jamaica Station.  How funny would it have been  if she answered  he's six?  Yeah.  Six years old.  I bet her head was  bobbing and weaving  during that call.  That's a good one.  She knows what murder is  at 187. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah.  She's using like  friggin...  Who else knows this?  Codes.  Snoop Dogg made  Snoop Dogg made  that main street.  187.  Sorry about that.  Yo.  Didn't hear that song.  It was in a few  NWA things  and ghetto boys  used to use it a lot.  I think we gotta leave actually.  Yeah, we have  a stupid meeting.  A meeting.  We have a lot of meetings.  We said that yesterday  and then we stayed  We're supposed to leave  at 10.30 yesterday.  Trying to keep my voice down.  What?  Yeah.  Trying to keep the voice down.  Yo, come on.  It's all I'm hearing is Bill. 
[03:39:00]  Now I can take a million phone calls.  Everyone loves you on the show,  loved you on the show.  It's just one guy.  It's a feedback.  They love when you guys are in.  So stop.  It's like that  They're trying to trick me.  They're trying to trick you.  If those guys really love us,  maybe they'll go and kill Drew for us.  There you go.  How's that?  If you love Bill  and want to hear  just his voice without us,  Caroline's.  All this weekend.  Caroline's.  Go down,  check out Bill Burr.  Yes.  And where's Bobby going to be? 
[03:39:30]  Bobby's going to be  on the radio Saturday night.  Saturday night.  And I was doing  my three hour show  and Quinn's not coming.  He refused to show up this time.  What's wrong with him?  I don't know.  Because he doesn't want to show.  Why?  I don't know.  I thought it was a midlife crisis,  but now it's just a crisis  because he's 50 something.  Is he still wearing those glasses  like he's at Belmont  waiting for his horse to come in?  With those big cataract glasses on?  That's how we met him.  We were at N.E.W.  And he was just walking the streets  with a racing form. 
[03:40:00]  Last time we got that  stupid operation for his eyes,  we did a college together  and he had to wear  those stupid glasses.  We were doing like 80 on the highway.  I took him off his face  and threw him out the window.  That's probably why  he had to get a dummy guy.  They're ruined.  See, more people love Bob and Bill.  Give them their own shows.  They do.  I did notice that also  when that woman was making  the 911 call,  what Line 6 is saying.  I think a lot of people  noticed this,  but I definitely noticed. 
[03:40:30]  Hey, HBV from Wisconsin.  Yeah.  How you doing, man?  What was your observation  about that 911 call?  I noticed that she is  the first black woman  or black person  that ever admitted O.J. did it.  I love the slow clap. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, we're going to try that one.  I'm writing that one down.  Slow clap.  We got to balance it out.  What can white people now  admit to publicly?  We admit to everything.  Well, the big conspiracy.  You know the thing  all white people meet about  every few weeks?  Yeah.  Oh, when?  Is that next Tuesday?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to get out of here.  I could be killed for that.  We got a line of the day?  Are you a mason?  Oh, by the way,  really fast, 
[03:41:30]  we talked about this  when it happened.  Remember the guy  that had sex  with the dead deer  on the side of the road?  What?  Who could forget?  What?  Jesus, not rape.  It's dead.  How do you end on that?  A 20-year-old man  received probation.  That's all he got for that.  There's something going on  in this guy's head.  Put him away.  That's called porn.  After he was convicted  of having sexual contact  with a dead deer,  the sentence also requires  blah, blah,  to be evaluated 
[03:42:00]  as a sex offender  and treated at the Institute  for Psychological  and Sexual Health.  The world is not big enough  to run from that story.  You can't be,  ah, move to Colorado.  Yeah.  It'll get you.  God, yeah.  How do you have sex  with a dead deer?  Did you lie down with it  on your side?  Did you find it?  Did you hit it with your car?  Did you roll it over  and hold its legs?  Yeah, what position do you use?  Yeah, it's dead.  It's clumsy and heavy.  I'd say just,  it's on its side.  Yeah, you lie down next to it.  And you kind of just lift the tail  and do it kind of sideways to it.  You know what it is?  It's those doe eyes,  just like that American Idol contestant. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, Bambi.  Oh, you like San Gio?  No, no, the white guy,  the bald guy?  No, the guy that Patrice is obsessed with.  Oh, I love that guy, yes.  Sangria?  Sangria.  Oh, a 254-pound seven-year-old.  Oh, that's adorable.  Oh, my God.  You just love to throw him in a pool.  Look at her.  Why is that kid that fat?  You fucking abusive mother.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He looks like Chubsy Hubsy.  Oh, applesauce, Mary. 
[03:43:00]  Wow.  You gotta like that kid.  I want to have him as a pet.  Yeah.  Would you just like to have him around your house to play with?  Just throw a ball to him.  You want to push him on the floor?  Yeah.  Watch him try to get up?  Get him do shit for donuts,  like get Entenmann's cookies  and make him roll over on the ground  and just giggle.  That's all fucked up.  That is.  I want a little fat kid for a pet.  More to the story.  The same guy was found guilty in April 2005  of felony mistreatment of an animal 
[03:43:30]  after he killed a horse  with the intention of having sex with the horse.  This guy's got a problem.  You can't fuck a horse.  You can have a huge dick to fuck a horse.  You know what the problem is?  He can't hold down what he wants to fuck.  Yeah.  So he has to kill it.  He's gotta kill it.  Yeah.  If he was like into squirrels,  maybe you could choke one of those out.  Who can't?  Right?  Choke a squirrel.  Actually, you couldn't.  Two fingers.  Fuck it like a hand pussy.  Jesus, Bob.  Bobby's ringtone?  What the fuck? 
[03:44:00]  My ringtone.  Got a little Flava Flava on there.  Yeah, boy.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  Sorry.  He can't even defend it.  No, he knows.
