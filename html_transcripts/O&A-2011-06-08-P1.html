<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic discussion about scheduling conflicts.  Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, were furious with their booker, Roland, for the last-minute addition of Andrew Breitbart and the subsequent failure to remove Glenn Close, whom they didn't want to interview.  The hosts expressed their frustration with Roland using numerous expletives, particularly directed at Glenn Close and Roland's booking decisions.  They also revisited a past negative experience with Paris Hilton, blaming Roland for a video Opie filmed without Hilton's consent and criticizing management's handling of the situation.  The hosts voiced their discontent with their treatment at SiriusXM, comparing it unfavorably to the treatment of other, more highly valued, personalities, and even contemplated leaving the show. Opie further detailed his frustrations with SiriusXM’s handling of celebrity photo requests, contrasting the current management’s lack of support with positive past experiences facilitated by former employee Eric Logan (who helped him get pictures with Tom Brady, Lady Gaga, Sting, and Robert Plant). He described the work environment as a "sweatshop".

The broadcast then shifted to a range of topics, including Roland's frustrations (with which Opie expressed solidarity), celebrity gossip (including a contentious Paris Hilton interview, Dakota Fanning’s graduation, and vulgar speculation about Khloe Kardashian's paternity and appearance, along with mentions of Chyna and her pornographic film, "Back Door to China"), Jon Stewart's hand injury, the Ultimate Warrior's feud with Hulk Hogan, and, most prominently, Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal.  A substantial portion of the show involved reading and acting out explicit excerpts from Weiner's online conversations with Lisa Weiss, with a guest reading for Weiss. The hosts offered humorous and vulgar commentary throughout this segment, speculating on Weiner's motivations.

Later, J.D. Williams (Bodie), Chad Coleman (Cutty), and Jamie Hector (Marlo) from *The Wire* joined the show. The conversation moved to their experiences on *The Wire*, their characters, an upcoming listener paintball event benefiting Jamie Hector's youth organization, Moving Mountains Incorporated, and a debate on LeBron James versus Michael Jordan.  They also discussed their post-*Wire* careers and the show's enduring popularity.  Glenn Close's late arrival was mentioned.

Glenn Close finally appeared, discussing her career, her charity work for mental illness ("Bring Change to Mind"), her role in *Fatal Attraction* (including her research process), and the portrayal of mental illness in media.  She also mentioned her pride in being a part of *The Wire*.

Andrew Breitbart then joined, discussing his involvement in the Anthony Weiner scandal, his possession of graphic photos of Weiner, and his reluctance to release them unless the women involved were threatened. He offered explicit sexual descriptions and criticized the media’s handling of the scandal.  He promoted his book, "Righteous Indignation," and mentioned a future reality show idea involving Weiner.  Vincent D’Onofrio’s impending arrival was announced.

Vincent D’Onofrio’s segment began with light banter about his modeling career, shifting to his work on *Law & Order: Criminal Intent*, including an anecdote about his girlfriend appearing in a photograph on set.  He discussed acting techniques, comparing his approach to those of Chris Walken and Robert De Niro, recalling his *Law & Order* audition, and reflecting on his career after *Full Metal Jacket*.  He also discussed various ways movies are framed and presented on different platforms.  The conversation returned to the Anthony Weiner scandal, with Breitbart’s role in breaking the story being discussed, including a reference to a photograph of Weiner’s genitals.  D'Onofrio expressed his opinions on the situation and his own political leanings, while emphasizing his non-partisan approach to work.  The segment concluded with plugs for D’Onofrio’s projects, Breitbart's book and website, and the show itself.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on SiriusXM's Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  I guess my nipples hog, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  By the way, thank you, Larry King, for that fine introduction.  A TV legend, and now you're doing the intro to this fine radio show.  I don't know if that's good or bad.  It's good, I'm retired.  He's not retired, though. He's everywhere.  Oh, whatever he's doing.  He's doing his comedy shtick. 
[00:01:00]  His borscht belt humor.  I bet you it's pretty good.  Yeah, it probably is. He's had a lot of life experiences.  I bet you it finds its audience.  Yeah.  Probably not much of our audience going to see Larry King.  You think it's fogies?  Old fogies?  I would call his audience fuddy-duddies.  Fuddy-duddies.  He's big with the fuddy-duddies.  A lot of money to be made with the fuddy-duddies.  Indeed.  Well.  Indeed.  Yes. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning to everybody.  Morning.  We've got a very busy show.  We have 11 pages of sexting that we have to get through.  Oh, my God. Is it that much?  Very crazy.  And I started traveling, so I'm like, you know, just print out all 11 pages.  What else are we going to do today?  By the way, Andrew Breitbart would like to come in at 9 today.  There's a lot of guests.  A lot of guests.  That messes up everything.  9.  You know how complicated today has become.  I know. 
[00:02:00]  Why would you even suggest that?  Because he's in the news.  We might be able to do 9 as I look at this schedule here.  And I was the one that said keep Glenn Close to fuck off the show today, but oh well.  We got the wire guys.  I don't want her on the fucking show.  We got too many people.  And she's somebody that, if you ask me.  Why didn't you get involved with that email thing that was going around yesterday?  Because yesterday.  But then things changed.  In the hallway.  Things changed after the hallway.  Fuck that. 
[00:02:30]  I said in the hallway yesterday after the show.  Here's my take.  I don't want Glenn Close in here tomorrow.  Too busy.  Call and tell her people we've overbooked and she's welcome to come in at a later date.  So, you don't want her.  I said I don't care at this point.  So, what did Jimmy say?  I said that I would love to talk to her, but today is just too busy.  Still too busy.  Then why the fuck is she coming in?  I heard because the wire guys, we got a bunch of them, but not a lot of them. 
[00:03:00]  So, then it felt like we could kind of squeeze her in, is what I was told.  I'd rather squeeze Breitbart in.  That's in the news.  All those transcripts and everything.  He'll tell you where they came from.  If Glenn Close comes in at 8.30, then Vincent...  D'Onofrio's at 9.30.  9.30.  Breitbart, 9.  He could hang...  Or Breitbart.  Everyone's saying it's Breitbart.  We got to stop.  Breitbart.  I'm fine.  It's Breitbart.  And then maybe he hangs for the rest of the show through the Vincent interview.  Could be. 
[00:03:30]  Or he could stay until fucking, you know, 9 to 9.30.  Either way, Glenn Close is not going to affect the Andrew Breitbart booking.  I just remember...  Because we're only going to do like 15 minutes with that.  We're going to pile up.  Just mark my words.  It's going to be a pile up.  It's not good.  All right.  Cancel Glenn Close.  Because I read...  What I did, I read the time schedule this morning because I had gotten a text from Breitbart  and figured, all right, if Glenn Close is coming in at 8.30, we could have him pop in 
[00:04:00]  at 9, even do a half hour with him, and then D'Onofrio comes in at 9.30.  So it's like, it still works out, but I'd rather have him come in at 8.30, fucking tell  Glenn Close to take a hike like I fucking said in the hallway to Roland, who obviously  didn't even fucking listen to me.  No.  I'm a fucking piece of shit when it comes to Roland.  When it comes to Roland and the guests.  No, man.  I am.  I've said no to so many people, and Roland insists on still booking them. 
[00:04:30]  They still walk through this fucking door.  Well, we all left.  That's exactly what was going to happen.  But then, did you read any of the emails going back and forth?  No, it was settled in the hallway.  It wasn't, though, because then some of the Wire guys weren't going to make it in.  Then there was only a couple guys coming in, and then those guys...  Here's my take.  Are stars, but maybe not huge stars.  So then it was like, okay, maybe we could squeeze her in.  And then I said, I don't care.  That's fine then.  But I'm only one voice.  I didn't care. 
[00:05:00]  Because I don't care.  If we have no guests today.  I would love no guests.  I just didn't want fucking Glenn Close on the show.  How about we all enjoy the fact that we did a great interview with Sugar Ray Leonard yesterday.  Yes, that was superb.  And we don't do guests.  Oh.  I kind of like when we just do a radio show.  Yeah, that's fun.  Instead of these people marching down the hall one by one.  No, I obviously don't mind the Wire, guys.  Now that you finally saw it four years later.  I saw it.  It's great.  Or D'Onofrio, obviously.  D'Onofrio.  Oh, I know. 
[00:05:30]  I'm just fucking around.  These are jokes.  I like that.  Jokes.  Fucking, you know, Breitbart.  He could add some more shit to these texts.  Jamie is coming as well.  Oh.  That's good.  Jamie Hector.  Yes, that's good.  Very good.  So where's Roland?  Uh-oh.  He's going to be doing some emotional eating today, man.  And fucking, like, this Glenn Close thing has been a pariah since her name came up.  Yeah, because we got tricked into thinking that we get excited talking to A-listers.  By the way, she's an A-lister now. 
[00:06:00]  She never won an Oscar.  She's probably down to a B-lister.  I know that Damages is a good show.  I've never seen it, though.  Well, we've never seen it exactly.  I bet she'd fit in great down the hall.  Is he here yet?  Morning mashup would love him.  Love her, right?  Tell him to get an extra breakfast because it's going to be a long day for Roland.  Oh, boy.  But the thing is, we're willing to take her early. 
[00:06:30]  I even said, if we could do her earlier than anybody else, let's get her in and be great.  But she can't come in.  Why don't you talk to Roland?  He's walking down the hall now.  Very busy.  I'll talk to Roland.  Does he even know what's going on?  Not yet.  Bring change to mind strikeout stigma.  It's mental...  We do retard jokes on this show!  What happened?  That's what she's doing.  A charity, by the way.  For the mentally ill.  I did some charity work yesterday.  Roland?  Yes.  Roland, my good friend.  He said he'd be dark. 
[00:07:00]  What happened?  I was...  I was...  Where's my beep?  Yeah.  I was treated like a common person yesterday.  I thought...  I thought yesterday we had gone over the Glenn Close situation and we weren't going to have her on.  I thought her people...  Yeah, that was if the big cast members of the Wires were coming in and they go, it's okay, so...  Because there was no big members, just two...  We got three now.  Now Jamie Hector's coming in.  Now Jamie Hector's coming in also. 
[00:07:30]  And then we got Vincent D'Onofrio.  And now, like Andrew Breitbart wants to come in at nine.  Well, I didn't have a Breitbart.  Well, that was a last minute thing.  Things are...  See, we needed some wiggle room for Breitbart.  When did Breitbart get a hold of you?  Fucking four this morning.  Four this morning.  I got a text for four this morning.  And, you know, we needed that wiggle room.  And I had said yesterday, I did say that Breitbart said he was coming in today.  I didn't know the exact time or anything, but that was the wiggle room we needed, was 
[00:08:00]  the Glenn Close wiggle room.  I didn't hear that.  I said that in the hall yesterday.  I didn't hear Breitbart.  Yeah, I was yelling about Glenn Close and the fact that she probably...  We should call her people and say, bye.  But then there were a lot of emails going back and forth yesterday.  And then...  In all fairness to Roland.  I was in a hotel.  I was watching the news.  I probably read 10 to 12 emails on the Wired thing yesterday, as everyone was giving their  opinions.  I saw some of the Wired... 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, then there were just the two guys, and then Jimmy goes, okay, you can bring her  in, because there's only J.D. Williams and Chad Coleman was only confirmed.  So, I mean, if I would have known that, I would have canceled her.  So, that's...  I'm just doing what the email said.  So, it's like...  Aunt was adamant yesterday.  Like a common...  I've treated.  Like a fucking...  On the street.  But then, Jimmy, you did write, say, okay, don't cancel her, because we only had Chad  and the other guy.  Yeah, I read...  I think Ope said... 
[00:09:00]  I'm not...  I'm just saying, I thought you said, all right, keeper.  And I was like, all right, what about keeper?  Yeah, it's about two.  But like I said, I'm one voice, so...  I thought you said spider.  Yeah.  What if I said one voice, two voice?  I said, after all the emails going around, I'm like, all right, I'm a keeper.  I thought you said you guys said Chad three, so I go, okay, Ope and Jim.  Yeah, but I wasn't thinking Breitbart, honestly.  I didn't even have no idea.  Breitbart.  If I knew about Breitbart...  Just so you don't have to deal with these idiots.  It's Breitbart!  All right.  Breitbart is...  I didn't even know about Breitbart or Breitbart.  He's a bigger get today than she is.  It's...  Yeah, with all the transcripts coming out in the paper. 
[00:09:30]  I mean, it's front page still.  Well, he would come in at nine.  And he might show you a picture.  Huh?  You know, and he might show everybody a picture in here.  That's all I'm saying.  Maybe on Twitter, the picture for you guys.  Huh?  I don't think any pictures are going to be Twittered.  Yeah, but I didn't know about that.  Oh, well.  She'll get over it.  Like, you'll get over the picture?  Come on.  Whoa!  Hey, you didn't get yours either.  I know.  It's the same thing.  Oh, no, trust me.  Please. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, damn.  Trust me.  You know what?  Now, fuck her.  Cancel her.  You're right.  Fuck her.  I would say...  Now, no more going to bat for Glenn Close.  It's easy to just call her people and say...  I'm just doing that.  I know what you're doing, brother.  And you're annoyed that I'm...  I know you're annoyed.  And you know I'm annoyed about yesterday.  So I'm not going to explode about yesterday.  All right.  I apologize to you, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I apologize to you.  Without it, I apologize to you.  I'm just saying things do change on a day-to-day basis with a show and guests.  And we rarely do it.  We rarely change to the point where a guest has to be canceled. 
[00:10:30]  Can I ask, what's the problem with Glenn Close?  There have been many guests that we have said, wow, we've got nothing to say.  But then they come in and it works out to be a great interview.  Hold on.  Hold on.  But going all the way back to the beginning, we all found out that we could get Glenn Close  on the show.  And we all got sort of tricked in a weird way.  And I'm not blaming Roland, by the way.  Like, all of a sudden, it went into our heads like, oh, Glenn Close, without even thinking 
[00:11:00]  about it.  And then you start thinking about it and go, well, why would we ever talk to her?  If you replay the tape of when you wrote it down and you're like, it's an A-list.  Let me write it down.  And you wrote it down and showed me, you'll hear in my voice, I go, oh.  Like, I thought A-lister.  I'm thinking, you know.  Will Smith or somebody?  Will Smith, Tom Cruise.  Will Smith or something like that.  And it was Glenn Close and I'm just kind of like, I don't, I don't care.  I don't watch the show. 
[00:11:30]  I haven't seen a movie she's made in, since they came out.  What was the last movie she did that anyone cared about?  Probably that fucking one with the rabbit.  She's done some stuff.  She's a pretty, she was a lawyer in that other movie, right?  She's a big, Glenn Close is a big name in Hollywood and I would actually, she's somebody I would  want to talk to, because I think she'd be a fun guest.  I met her at Dane Cook's taping.  Yeah.  I'm sure she's not a stiff.  I'm sure she is.  But it's just a busy day. 
[00:12:00]  It's not.  I will bet a lot of money in the end when we talk to Glenn Close today.  I know there's no way to, it's like one of those snowballs rolling down a hill.  There's no way to stop it.  She's pushing a retarded charity, like a charity for mentally ill.  A retarded charity?  No, a charity for retarded people.  Yes.  Yeah, she's throwing the first pitch out at the Mets game.  At Citi Field.  All right, so the people there will enjoy her throwing a ball.  Oh, God.  Great.  We do more fucking retard jokes on this show than anything. 
[00:12:30]  She heard the show.  Does she know about this show?  I don't know.  I don't think she's going to be as upset.  I obviously don't think she'll be that upset.  If we just have our people say, oh, God, one of the shows you're doing today.  Is she doing more shit today?  Obviously, if she couldn't come in earlier, she's doing something.  She's coming in early for us.  And then if it was going to be just 15 minutes, she's probably got something afterwards, right?  She's doing two other shows now.  It's got fucking, look, she's got time to hang out. 
[00:13:00]  Drink some coffee.  Relax a little bit.  Yeah.  Instead of doing this stupid ass fuck show.  I know, but sometimes they get antsy.  Well, I got to tell you, Roland, part of the job, I think, is not only getting the good guests for us, which you have been impeccable at doing,  but it's telling some of the guests, ah, you know, maybe not today.  That's what I think.  That never happens.  I mean, on TV, though, you have a...  People get bumped.  Sure.  People get bumped all the time. 
[00:13:30]  All the time.  Yeah, Letterman bumps people all the time.  Right.  And Letterman bumps comics all the time.  Comics are seen as expendable.  Remember the author on Jerry Langford's show?  I sure do.  No, sir, I don't see the name, sir.  Sorry, it happens.  No, Glenn Close, I don't see your name, Glenn Close.  I'll check again, Glenn Close.  No, Glenn Close, your name is not here, Glenn Close.  Let's be in cahoots with the guys downstairs and make sure her name is not in the system.  Get her name out of the system.  And then we go, ah, I don't know what happened. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Make sure Breitbart's name is in the system.  What time can he come?  He's coming in.  At 9 o'clock.  We're going to see...  I might be able to get him in earlier.  No, you can't do earlier.  No, no.  Did you look at the schedule?  Don't do earlier.  Glenn Close, though.  Oh, okay.  I hear you.  If we nix Glenn Close, then we can push him up.  Maybe we can bring him in 15 minutes earlier.  Yeah, that sounds good.  8.45.  And you know the Wire guy's going to be here a little early, so we'll throw them in as  soon as they get here.  I don't see them being early.  Oh, they'll be early. 
[00:14:30]  They'll be early.  I bet you they're here by 7.45.  Holy moly.  So what do we do with Glenn Close once again?  I say...  Where's Ronnie B to save us?  If she's going to...  Well, if we're the first one she was going to do, I'd say if she's in the building, we  can have her walk in for 10 minutes.  Sure.  But you can't have her come and then not talk to her, but...  Wait, is she doing other interviews here?  Yeah, she's got a couple others, yeah.  Who?  I don't know right now. 
[00:15:00]  Morning mashup?  Yeah, because maybe we just tell her we're big fans, but we're really busy.  Come on in.  Tell us about the charity.  Blah, blah, blah.  Great.  All right, man.  We'll do this again some other day.  A nice long interview.  She's booked for sports, for the Mets Connection, OutQ, and Ron and Fez have her booked.  Ron and Fez!  Oh, so she's going to be on our channel, no matter what.  She's safe.  But he's not coming until later on, Ronnie B.  Yeah, but...  But it's...  Ronnie saves us again. 
[00:15:30]  Ronnie B.  Ronnie saves us again.  Fucking iron horse.  Ronnie putting that cape on and saving us again.  Ronnie B.  Ronnie B.  The big...  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  The big B on his chest.  No, you guys are set for tonight.  Why'd you take that shot at Jimmy?  That was rude.  No, I deeply apologize.  I'm an asshole for that.  No, I admit it.  I was an asshole.  I shouldn't have done it.  Did your claws come out for a second?  No, I just was panicked.  So, you know how it is in here.  You go, ah.  Well, we're all extremely...  And, Roland, this has nothing to do with me and you. 
[00:16:00]  You know I love you.  I know, I know.  I know.  And I know this is a...  It puts a little pressure on you.  It just...  After last week...  After...  What happened last week?  Yeah, what happened last week?  Nothing happened last week.  We had great interviews with everybody, didn't we?  It turns out Paris Hilton was a cunt.  Oh, Paris Hilton, that has nothing to do with anybody.  That has nothing to do with anybody.  I know, but...  She turned out to be a cunt.  None on us.  We were justified in the end.  None on us in that one.  Even if people were suspicious of us last week, it turns out she was a cunt.  How was that on you?  Did they blame you for The View as well?  But she was fucked.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:16:30]  The View and every other show she did that they shit on her?  Are you being blamed for the bad ratings that she's getting?  No, I got blamed for the interview.  How did you get blamed?  Well, whoever blamed you, you send them to me.  I'll fucking take care of it, believe me.  Right.  Yeah, it was an ugly situation, so...  Holy shit, it was an ugly interview.  I know.  And we had nothing to do with it.  I know, nothing to do with you guys, but then for some...  I got blamed, so...  Well, you should march back in there and tell them,  my boys are really pissed off that your client gave them a shitty interview. 
[00:17:00]  Give them shit like you just gave Jimmy.  No.  No, no, no.  It wasn't...  It wasn't most of your people.  Sam's trying to start something.  Whoa, his singular.  Whoa.  Trust me.  My ear here is deaf.  You don't hear Sam, do you?  No, no.  You got your Sam filter on?  Yeah, no, just I get in trouble for that.  What'd you get in trouble for?  And then if she cancels the rest of the platform by not waiting,  then I'll get to double the second time. 
[00:17:30]  What happened?  No, no, no, no, no.  The Paris Hilton turned out to be a cunt.  Everyone knows that.  I know.  Glenn Close gets an extra ten minutes to fucking sit around and have some coffee.  Right.  But she's coming in at like age 20.  What?  No, she comes in early because the publicist told her to come in early.  For what?  They all come in like ten-fifths minutes early.  Where's Glenn Close?  Set up a room with Sam.  She'll never know it's not even on the air.  We got an empty studio around.  Yeah, she's a dummy.  And Sam could go in there and just be like, 
[00:18:00]  Hey, it's Glenn Close.  And then you talk to her.  Go, hey.  Just put a banner behind Sam that says Opie and Anthony.  These people don't know what we look like.  And go, I thought you were a guy.  You know, because of the name.  She'll laugh and then it breaks the ice.  Put her in a room with Bobo.  That's what she deserves.  Get along.  I knew you.  I heard you.  Oh, my God.  Now, that's hilarious.  If you want to do ten minutes, bring her in and say, 
[00:18:30]  Thank you, you're busy.  And then that's...  There's no way to get her off the show, is there?  That's what I said to you.  There's no way to get her off the show.  I'll tell you what happened out there last week.  It was bad.  Who is the person that came to you and said,  You fucked up?  You fucked up.  Baldi?  Now, how the fuck is that you fucking up?  What did you say in your defense?  It was a long story, so I have to start for the week. 
[00:19:00]  And if that motherfucker's coming to you,  then he obviously thinks we did something wrong.  Well, that's...  Well, I want to speak with him.  No, that was a different matter.  What was a different matter?  That's what I try to tell Roland off the air,  that if those guys aren't coming to us directly,  then there's no problems with anything.  Then there's no problem.  There's no problems with anything  unless they come to us and tell us there's a problem.  How would Gary come to you  and give you shit about the Paris interview 
[00:19:30]  when you had nothing to do with anything  that even happened in this studio  where we had nothing to do with it going awry?  And it wasn't necessarily the interview that was the issue.  No, if you're hinting at the video,  I did that on my own.  That has nothing to do with you.  I popped on my camera and I started fucking filming.  I didn't know that she didn't want to be filmed.  Fuck her.  Fuck her.  Fuck her people  and fuck the people that are fucking blaming you.  What, is that you?  You're supposed to fucking come in here  and snatch up all the cameras and everything? 
[00:20:00]  I did the camera thing on my own.  You're okay.  You're on the clear.  I see Paris Hilton sitting literally seven feet away from me.  I'm going to turn on a camera.  Sorry.  And then I fucking posted it.  Yes.  So it's on me, not you.  And that's what I told them off the air.  You can talk about it on the air.  If these assholes come to us directly,  then it's an issue.  Until then, there's no issues.  And secondly, I was talking to Brother Weasel yesterday.  He's like, wow, that Paris Hilton video.  Holy shit, that's a great hit for you guys.  Like, don't they even fucking understand 
[00:20:30]  that's huge to get that shit out there no matter what?  Yeah.  She's known around the fucking world  and we got video of her acting like a cunt.  Believe me, there's video of her sucking cock out there.  Right.  And nothing came of it.  Right.  I think a little bit in this radio station  isn't going to do anything.  And you know what?  I'll speak for Roland.  Fuck it.  Like, I guess she was supposed to sign something  or her people were supposed to sign something, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And for some reason, it's Roland's responsibility  because she marched out without signing anything  because she was pissed off because...  Not Roland's problem. 
[00:21:00]  Because she decided she was going to be a cunt that morning.  Supposed to chase an angry fucking twat  into an elevator to sign something?  Fuck this shit.  And it turns out that she was partying  until three in the morning  even though she's trying to tell us  she's a businesswoman at 30 years old.  That's why she was tired  and gave us a shitty interview that day.  And then she knew she was sucking dick, basically,  and decided I can't be part of this  because I'm not...  I don't have a brain when it comes down to it.  So she marched out of here  fucking the whole company over  and then they turn around  and try to fuck Roland?  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's misplaced fucking anger  and they don't want to come to us.  Roland had no idea  that I turned on my fucking camera and filled.  No one had an idea, really,  until I posted it.  No one who's really to blame  gets blamed around here.  Or no one who...  Not even blame.  That sounds ridiculous.  If there is a discussion  that needs to be had,  it should be between  whoever has the problem  and who they have the problem with.  Not fucking 10 degrees of go-betweens  or, you know, 
[00:22:00]  the guy that's booking the guests  or something.  If there's a problem with something I did,  talk to me.  And know what?  Something that Opie did,  talk to him.  Jimmy, talk to him.  And if we don't hear from...  No, Roland.  Roland, no.  If we don't hear from those guys down the hall,  it's never a problem.  Nope.  Know when the Paris Hilton video  became a problem?  11, I think...  11.30 at night.  Oh, really?  The video was up,  at that point,  probably 12 hours.  Okay?  Yeah.  And then when I did talk to the guy,  I convinced him, 
[00:22:30]  let's keep the video up  until tomorrow morning.  But then at that point,  I decided to make the video private  just to calm people down.  Yeah.  Mostly because Roland was freaking out,  even though I'm like,  there's no reason to freak out  because no one came to me  or Anthony about the video  all day long.  No one.  It was just a bad two days for me.  Yeah, but they're beating you up  for no reason.  I know.  Do you understand that?  I know.  You didn't tell me to make the video?  No.  I didn't tell you I made the video.  I marched out of here  and I fucking uploaded it.  You're supposed to be Kreskin. 
[00:23:00]  Paris Hilton had a bad time on our show  because she just sucks in general  and she's a party girl,  even though she's trying to make believe  she's not anymore.  And she marched out of here  because she knew she was going to  just get fried by every single person  in this place.  And then you're supposed to follow her  and her people  and have her try to sign shit?  Get the fuck out of here.  Do you want her or not?  I'm just so stressed right now.  Roland, are you okay?  I'm just so stressed.  No, calm down.  Calm down. 
[00:23:30]  Roland, it's okay.  We'll get Glenn Close in.  Get Glenn Close.  It's okay.  Shake it off.  Deep breaths.  The stress of this place  is going to kill people.  It's just going to kill people.  There will be corpses  from people just fucking dying of stress.  Well, that's why I'm... 
[00:24:00]  I'm sorry.  That's why I'm out of here in a year.  I have no problem.  It's just fucking...  It's too stressful.  What you're hearing from Roland right now  really is the way every one of us feels  every day here.  Every day of our lives.  Yeah, because the shit that went on yesterday  we'll discuss a little bit too  in a manner that keeps it safe for everybody.  E-Rock, you're not mad at me, Roland, are you?  I'm just fucking defending you.  Roland's not mad.  He's very frustrated.  He's very frustrated.  I'm defending you because if these fucking...  Once again, if these guys don't come down the hall  and talk to me and Ant, 
[00:24:30]  they can't be beating you guys up.  Because it's only a problem when it gets to us.  E-Rock, what were you going to say  that you said in my fucking ear?  There's times throughout the day  that I've overheard and seen  from a variety of people that work here  the shit that Roland has to go through.  What is he going through?  They come in,  they'll talk to him about something  and then they come back in maybe 20 minutes later  on the same subject.  Now it seems to be escalating  and then they'll come back a half an hour again  and it's getting worse. 
[00:25:00]  The guy's giving us great guests.  Details.  Great guests.  E-Rock, you're languishing in vagaries.  Once again, you're vague.  Oh God, you're right.  That's just like the news story.  When you said he calls and goes,  watch the news.  Yeah, E-Rock is the vaguest person I know in my life.  It's so frustrating.  Have some balls.  Say what you fucking want.  He'll start his text messages with,  hey, and then you write back,  hey, what's up?  Can I talk to you for a second?  Yeah.  And then maybe by the third text  he starts telling you what's going on.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:25:30]  So fucking details.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  Go with the Paris Hilton thing  because that's very fresh.  All right, exactly.  With the Paris Hilton thing.  Because now we got Roland fucking crying.  There was like two or three different people  coming into our office  talking to Roland about the release,  the way that she was handled,  the video.  Did anybody talk to Opie about this yet?  And Roland's like,  I tried.  I haven't heard back from him yet.  Well, that's not good enough.  How about they fucking walk in  and talk to Opie?  And let me tell you my world  because I've been at this 
[00:26:00]  a long fucking time.  Roland did get to me.  And I'm like,  I'm not worried about it  until one of the quotes,  and I use quotes,  bosses get to me.  Because it's not a problem  until someone talks to me directly.  Roland's not the in-between  between those guys and us.  No!  Whatsoever.  He books for the show.  They're beating him up  to try to get me  to take down a video,  and I'm walking around New York  going,  I'll fucking take it down  when one of the main guys  finally gets a hold of me.  That's exactly my logic.  Go ahead, E. 
[00:26:30]  Like I said,  it's an impeccable job  of booking for this show,  and he shouldn't take shit  from those fucking guys down the hall.  Because they don't contact you.  Nobody here contacts  the three of you for anything,  and they go right after him.  Well, I spoke to Gary that night.  I called Gary.  It was like 10.30 at night.  It was going on before 11.30.  It might have got to you by 11.30,  but it was happening before that.  It was going on all day,  but my point being,  if Gary or Rob or Steve  don't talk to me,  then I'm fine.  Everyone else should be fine,  by the way,  because I took it upon myself. 
[00:27:00]  Roland didn't say,  hey, make sure you video  and get this up.  No!  I called Gary by that  10 o'clock at night.  I talked to him,  and I'm like,  you know,  you can't.  I'm like,  you know,  because Roland was concerned,  so I just called him.  He didn't answer me.  I just called him.  And Gary's like,  no, no, no, I know.  And he's like,  it was just a release issue.  And I'm like,  well, the release,  there's also a platform-wide release,  which he's not responsible  for getting right  just necessarily before our show.  No!  And he knew that.  And he goes,  you think he's still up?  Like, meaning that he was  in a column,  and I think they talked  the next morning.  But by that point,  he knew,  and it was nothing.  The initial, 
[00:27:30]  all they think of here  is lawsuits.  It's all they think of,  but I'm just...  I know, I know,  and I'm just voicing my fucking...  It's all they think of  is if there's a...  When something happens,  immediately,  every head in this place  on that side  turns to,  there's going to be  a legal issue,  who do we blame,  and how do we not get blamed?  Yes.  That's all it is.  That's all well and good,  but...  So he was the first line  in their mind of defense.  Well, he was supposed  to get this,  which would have fallen apart  completely very quickly.  They should have went  right to me and aunt. 
[00:28:00]  They have a throw  under the bus machine  back there.  They can't fire Roland  or threaten a firing over that.  No.  They can't.  It's not his fucking job  in the end.  Not his job.  It's unbelievable.  What else is he?  So they were beating him up  all day after the Paris Hilton thing?  What you're saying is  they can't fire him  and threaten all that stuff,  but it's being done  in a way  without those words  being directly said,  but everything else  that they're saying  is being implied  that your ass  is on the line for this, 
[00:28:30]  that we can get rid of you  at any time.  Oh, fucking A.  That's impossible.  That is...  Good luck.  That is impossible.  Because Thursday was really bad.  I got a record where  it's still on my phone.  I think Gary finally...  Gary reacted to something  I tweeted that night  because I was starting  to get frustrated  because I knew  I didn't hear  from anyone from the company  and then he's like,  hey, what's up?  I just saw your tweet  or something like that  and that was probably  10.30, 10.45.  Probably.  So then I guess technically 
[00:29:00]  that's when officially  it was a problem,  that video.  God.  That I shot on my own  without telling anybody.  This fucking place.  I just fucking  picked up my new camera  and I set it down  for that interview  because I knew  she was going to be difficult.  It's just...  It's stunning, this place.  Yeah.  It really is.  It never ceases to amaze me  no matter how hard  I try to have loyalty.  Oh.  They managed to do something  to make me regret it.  These guys don't know  how to take care  of their people. 
[00:29:30]  They take care of the one guy  and even the one guy  is fucking pissed.  Even the one guy  is not happy.  Believe me.  He's pissed off at him.  He's got millions  of dollars in issues.  Yeah, he's...  He's not happy.  He's the ultimate pissed off guy  in the room.  Yeah, he's not happy.  Holy shit.  We're going to lose  one of our...  We're going to lose  somebody else soon  because I had a long talk  with somebody else yesterday  about this place.  Yeah.  You're going to write it down?  Is it Glenn Close?  Yeah.  She's being hired  as manager of operations.  I got to write this one down.  Yes, write that down. 
[00:30:00]  For the newer listeners,  don't get frustrated  by us writing shit down.  All this always comes out.  It always comes out.  Believe me.  Almost everything.  Any new listeners  that happen to stumble on it...  What?  I didn't see.  Can I see?  Please don't see.  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  I won't.  But I'll read you  what was sent to me yesterday.  Holy mother...  This is a regular day,  by the way,  after I leave this fucking place.  Yeah.  It's a regular fucking day.  That's why when the 
[00:30:30]  Paris Hilton thing  was going down,  I'm like,  I'm walking around New York  with my kid.  I was at playgrounds.  I was getting fucking treats  and I was just enjoying myself  waiting for those guys  to write me or call me.  Yeah.  Knowing the longer they wait,  that video...  I'll tell you,  that video would get out there.  Mm-hmm.  People would see it  on my channel  and I knew damn well  the pests were going to grab it  and start pushing it there.  Yeah.  You know, to other places.  That's where I happened.  So when I did take my video down,  guess what?  It didn't do anything in the end  because there's 10 to 12 copies 
[00:31:00]  of that thing out there.  Still easily accessible.  So I just walked around  fucking licking ice cream cones  and all that shit  just waiting.  Because I've been at this fucking job  a long time.  I know how this shit works.  And that's why I try to tell Roland.  I'm like,  until they get a hold of me,  I'll say it again,  there's no issue  and certainly no issue with you.  Because if they told you to tell me,  then you did your job.  And they're happy.  We had the three of us  with Blatter  and Roland's name was brought up  and Blatter  had nothing but praise 
[00:31:30]  and said,  no, people are even amazed  how well he works with everybody.  He said,  there hasn't been one complaint  from anybody he's worked.  Yeah.  So like,  behind the scenes,  I think they feel that Roland  is a way to get through  to the show  that's kind of a nicer way.  Leave Roland alone.  He has nothing to do  with fucking anything else  on this program.  He books great guests.  We have great fucking interviews.  They do know that  and his job is,  believe me,  not in any way.  Look at pre-Roland  and post-Roland  as far as guests go on the show  and the quality of interviews go.  It's a big, 
[00:32:00]  it's black and white.  It's a bigger issue.  Management has always tried  this tact over the years.  Try to have all the people  get to us.  Chipping away at the periphery  instead of going for  the fucking,  the three of us  and fucking talking to us.  Look,  put it on record.  Put it on record.  If there's an issue,  you can't,  you got to get to us directly.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  He's stressing out for,  Roland,  I swear to you  and I'm sorry  you broke down this morning.  You're stressing about nothing.  You're doing a great job  for us and this company  and, 
[00:32:30]  and,  and they weren't going to fire you.  They didn't have a case.  Yeah,  but if somebody tells you  you have to,  I mean,  that's why I was like,  okay.  Yeah,  but then you go back to them  and go,  all right,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I did what you said.  She marched out of here,  that twat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She marched out of here.  Were you supposed to tackle her?  And what this company,  what this company should be doing  is getting to her people,  her publicists,  the,  the,  the,  the network she's involved with  and go,  look,  you really fucked over our company  and our guys.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  You know,  they are exactly what you just said.  They are wormy.  And I mean,  the,  the company as a whole is wormy  when it comes to big name talent or names.  They don't,  it's like you have a 20,  million subscription company here.  And that's what?  Two people per sub.  You're talking to 35 to 40 million people.  Listener base.  It's listener base.  You don't have to kiss ass when somebody is atrocious.  Right.  It isn't like Springsteen came to play  and somebody tripped him and broke his guitar  and his fucking shoulder. 
[00:33:30]  It's stupid Paris Hilton.  Within a year,  no one will give a shit about her.  And she was terrible.  Please.  Absolutely.  She didn't walk in and get sandbagged here.  We didn't fucking ambush her.  We were so fucking nice.  She wouldn't have been nicer to her.  That's why I love,  that's why I love that video.  Cause now,  thank God,  there's evidence out there.  Yeah.  There's fucking evidence out there  that we were on our best behavior.  You know,  knowing if we went after,  then they would spin it and go,  wow,  Opie and Anthony haven't learned a thing  in all these years.  And there's still a bunch of twats.  There would have been a problem.  A non-fan of the show. 
[00:34:00]  Not that she doesn't like the show,  but she doesn't listen to it.  Sent me a PM on Twitter.  Megan McCain said,  hey,  I watched that Paris video.  Why was she like that?  You guys were so nice to her.  Dude.  That's what everybody's impression of.  Everyone's calling me.  All my little fucking moles out there  and other radio guys.  I've been getting calls like,  wow,  what a,  congrats.  And we,  we are,  and we're,  they make us feel like shit about it.  Yeah.  I got people calling me from all over the country  going,  wow, 
[00:34:30]  we do great radio every day,  but it's,  it's stuff like this that make people talk  and make people call me personally  and go,  wow,  you guys are onto some shit,  huh?  Anyway.  It's our problem.  She was a fucking piece of shit.  And then this came in yesterday,  which I was dealing with,  not to do with,  it's not Roland or any of the guys in this room,  okay?  Or Iraq,  who's in the other room.  When you're good,  I need to get your advice about the future.  Sirius XM is a very difficult,  difficult entity to stay friendly with.  And boy,  does that say it all. 
[00:35:00]  Boy,  does that say it all.  Difficult entity.  That's what we're finding.  Yeah.  That's what we're finding.  Stupid,  I didn't mean to say stupid.  I don't mean to say stupid.  You know how I do that though.  I'm sorry.  But some people go,  what the fuck?  I'm not offended at all.  Jimmy couldn't get his Lady Gaga picture yesterday.  And it was the way he was told.  Without mentioning names,  the way he was told.  The way I was told  and the way I had been trying to do it.  Makes it sound like  we're some dumb music jock  on a dumb channel  that no one listens to.  Fuck music jock.  That was,  that was, 
[00:35:30]  you were treated like  if a UPS guy came up  and saw that shit was going on  with a celebrity  and was like,  well,  maybe I could get myself an autograph.  And then someone just dismissed you like,  if you think you're getting an autograph,  you best get back in the fucking elevator.  Yeah,  they had,  and the way I was trying to,  like,  as much as I talk shit on this program  about getting photos,  I'm not an idiot.  And I'm not going to,  if Lady Gaga walks in with security people,  I'm not going to stand on the corner  and go,  I'm not that stupid. 
[00:36:00]  And I do know that I'm at work  and I do know it's a special event  that was booked through Harpo,  which is Oprah's company.  I know all of that.  And I know everybody here is nervous  because it's Oprah's booking.  It's not a SiriusXM booking.  None of the bookers could do anything here.  Liam,  Roland,  Spencer,  none of those guys  who would have normally helped me  or Steve could.  So I knew all that.  So what I did was  I texted Elo,  who's the president of Harpo.  The president of Harpo.  Can I stop you for a second?  The only guy  that ever understood the show  and knew how to push it forward.  I have such a love for Eric Logan. 
[00:36:30]  Tremendous love.  He's management in the end  and, you know,  management in general.  But he is by far  the best guy  we've ever worked for.  Yeah.  I mean,  he got it  and understood  our little foibles  and he would understand  Jimmy's picture-taking thing  and what it means to him  and if you could help him out  in some way  it makes him a happier employee  which makes for a better radio show  which makes for a better  fucking company.  But the route I was taking,  and you're right,  and he just understood that,  but I texted Elo 
[00:37:00]  and I also,  my agent knows her agent.  So I said,  look,  can you ask  if it's okay  if I'm introduced to her?  It was a request  that was going to go  directly to her assistant  who was with her  from her agent.  And I also called  the Live Nation guy  in Philly  who I know  who knows her people.  Is it okay?  So it was going to be,  for me to get that photo,  it was going to be okayed  if it happened  by somebody at Harpo  and somebody  who was directly with her. 
[00:37:30]  I was not just going to walk in  like an idiot  and go,  come on.  So I know that.  Again,  I'm really not a dumb guy  and I really don't think  of myself above the company.  I'm not going to do anything  that's going to endanger  the company's relationship  with Harpo  or make SiriusXM look bad.  I'm not a moron.  Of course not.  And so I'm down in the area  with my camera  and I was talking to a couple of guys  from Oprah's channel  who we all know  and I was just approached  by somebody in management  and they said,  you're not going to try  to get a photo today,  are you? 
[00:38:00]  And I'm like,  well,  I didn't have time  to explain  this is what I did  and if it worked out  and they go,  look,  today's not the day,  not the day.  And I'm like,  all right,  well,  I guess I'll just say hi  to Gayle King  because we did  the Tonight Show together  and they said,  I don't know,  she's going to be too stressed.  So I was told  that I couldn't even say hello  to Gayle King  who I did Leno with.  I want to say this carefully.  It was,  you say management.  Yeah.  It's up there,  management.  It has to be said.  It has to be said.  That's all I'll say. 
[00:38:30]  And I was,  I was basically  shooed out of the area  and it was,  again,  I was shocked  but then again,  I wasn't.  Like,  I wasn't even that,  I was angry  but I was like,  I wasn't surprised at all.  No.  When you texted me yesterday,  I'm like,  of course that's how it went down.  Of course that's the way.  I was shocked in that moment  but it's like,  oh yeah,  this is where you work.  Yeah.  Oh,  dumbbell.  Ah,  now I understand.  I forgot for a split second.  I forgot.  What a dummy I am. 
[00:39:00]  It's never going to be  any way but that.  Yeah.  So I didn't go ballistic over it  or,  you know,  I knew what it was  and then I talked to Eric Logan  who actually was coming in.  And once again,  because these people,  you know,  they get a little confused.  Used to be our boss.  Used to be our boss, right.  Moved on to work for Oprah.  He's pretty much Oprah at this point.  I believe he's the president of her company.  If Oprah retires,  then it has,  Eric Logan has to be the new Oprah.  That's how high up in the company  he has become already.  Or there's one under,  over him, 
[00:39:30]  but he's that close.  Oh,  is he the president?  He's co-president.  So,  he was going to walk me in.  He was getting here kind of late.  Lady Gaga was running late.  To be very honest,  I don't know if it would have happened  even with Eric  because she literally came in late  and went right into the fishbowl  and it was probably,  it was one of those things  where I don't even know  if it would have happened with him  because he had to leave for a meeting.  So,  I might not have been here with him.  I just want to stop you,  Jimmy,  but the difference is,  is what he said to you.  That's the difference  and,  and what the other guy said to you.  You know what I mean? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Elo would have tried to help me.  He showed a little respect for you  and,  and the fact that you like  getting pictures with celebrities  and the fact that you're  a big part of this company  even though he doesn't work here anymore.  And,  and,  and that was as a friend as well.  But he actually advised me  not to.  He goes,  look,  if you've been told you shouldn't,  she gave me good advice  and that's why I was texting you.  So I,  I wasn't going to come back.  you could have went over  the other guy's head technically.  I don't even know  if I could have done that  because the way it worked.  Well,  what did he say to you?  Because I thought that was great  and that's why I loved Eric Logan. 
[00:40:30]  Um,  he just said,  look,  I'm like,  because he had called me  and I'm like,  look,  I was kind of asked  not to try to get a picture.  Not to try.  Um,  and he said,  yeah,  you probably,  he goes,  look,  it will happen.  He goes,  I'll,  I'll make a call for you  when,  uh,  if you're ever on the road  and you're in an area she's in,  I'll,  I'll make it happen.  I'll call somebody.  And I'm like,  and I believed him.  And okay,  no problem.  I wasn't going to try to,  I'm not,  I'm not a belligerent idiot.  Like if,  if literally somebody  that hands me my paycheck  says don't do something, 
[00:41:00]  I'm not,  right.  I'm not a lapdog,  but I'm not a dummy.  I'm not career suicide.  And it's just,  from what I heard,  the way it was told to you,  you,  you were treated like  just a piece of fucking shit.  I will,  I'll never forget it.  Uh,  but again,  I'm not going to react  with freaking out.  I did the right thing.  I,  I was shooed away  and I left  and that's it.  Literally shooed away.  But again,  it wasn't,  what annoyed me the most about it  was this lack of faith.  Like,  do you really think,  like,  do you not think I know  anybody else in the business  that I would,  I would just stand here? 
[00:41:30]  Try to blindside somebody.  I really don't do that.  I really don't do that.  And when,  like when Jennifer Lopez  came through by herself,  she had people,  it was a nightmare.  I know not to go out.  I'm not a fucking moron.  No,  you go through the proper channels.  You went through,  we went through everything.  With Kareem,  I went through all the proper channels  and I waited  and he recognized me.  You always go through  the proper channels.  I don't,  I don't,  I just don't get this place,  man.  I mean,  Gayle King,  I guess she's okay  as a broadcaster.  She's,  she's not bringing in  subscribers like we are.  And if we were the ones 
[00:42:00]  that were chosen  in different circumstances  to interview Lady Gaga,  of course they would have  marched Gayle King  right in here  to get a fucking picture taken.  Why are we,  why are we such fucking scum?  We bring in so many  more subscribers  than,  than these people  that they treat  like rock stars.  Like you weren't even allowed  to get close  to Gayle King yesterday.  Why?  And the thing is,  we've done a,  we've done a major show together.  Yeah.  It's almost like  what's so insulting  is to think,  what did you think  I was going to do?  Stand there and pester her?  I was going to say hello to her. 
[00:42:30]  She was very nice to me  the one time I,  I interacted with her.  I said,  oh yeah,  I have a show on,  on a show on SiriusXM.  And we just chatted  for a minute  in the dressing room.  Like,  what did you think  I was going to do?  Yeah.  That's what drives me.  When have I ever done something?  Hey,  could I get a picture?  It boggles my mind  is you get so spoiled  being treated a certain way.  And I mentioned it tonight  just because that's  the one group  I interact with  on a regular basis  that has access  to people like that. 
[00:43:00]  And the way they treat you,  it's like,  oh my God,  oh yeah,  you really get spoiled  and then you come back here  and you're like,  oh right,  right.  I desperately want  out of radio  and the reason  is not because  I don't enjoy  doing the show  with you guys  is that I'm so sick  after all these years  of being just treated  like scum.  Because you see  other guys  that we work with  get treated so well  in other entities  but because we do radio  we're just,  we're supposed to be  treated like scum. 
[00:43:30]  And I fucking have had it  to be honest with you.  I don't have to work anymore  and I don't,  I don't want to put up  with this anymore.  Like yesterday  when you texted me  I was fucking furious.  Yeah,  I was too.  And it's always like,  like,  Gayle King doesn't bring in  the subscribers we do  but they fucking  rope off the area  and this and that  and everything is like,  it gets crazy  when these people  come through.  Keep the scum away.  No offense  but Oprah doesn't bring in  the amount of subscribers  we do,  especially when you start  figuring out contracts  and stuff  and who's more valuable.  But when she comes 
[00:44:00]  to SiriusXM  they set it up  like a president  is walking fucking through.  On TV,  she's huge.  Believe me,  we understand that.  It's huge.  Huge ratings,  everything.  But in this medium,  we do very well.  This is what we do.  Right.  Yet,  we're just fucking  shit on at every turn.  We should have been praised  for the Paris Hilton thing.  We should have been praised  for the video  that got kind of  squeaked out there.  But instead,  and I said this  at the end of that show,  eventually we'll get blamed for it.  Go back to the tape.  I said,  eventually there'll be a problem. 
[00:44:30]  I said it.  It was one of the last things  I said that day.  And here we are.  We have Roland crying over it.  And there is no going  above and beyond  here.  Like,  when you do  in other areas,  it really does  amount to nothing.  None of it means shit.  It really doesn't, man.  And it's frustrating.  It's like,  it drives me nuts.  It's like,  you want to be loyal.  You want to,  like,  I mean,  I'm loyal as far as,  they pay my bills.  I'm not going to not do it.  I'm not going to start  podcasting behind,  you know,  I'm not a fucking,  they just, 
[00:45:00]  there's something  that they don't understand  about dealing with people  who work for them  and whatever.  It is what it is.  And by the way,  we're the voice of pretty much  most of the personalities here.  A lot of people  march these halls  and they are just  fucking fed up  and frustrated.  Yeah.  I can't name names,  that's up to them.  Sure.  But I mean,  that is a very good  look at the vibe  around this place.  And we have an easy job  compared to a lot of people  out there.  But I thought to myself,  like,  I do relate when people  talk about dealing with boss.  It's like,  you guys, 
[00:45:30]  I know we bitch about them a lot,  but it is very frustrating.  And stuff like that  happened.  It's like,  I'm under no illusions  as to where I am  on the entertainment ladder.  Believe me,  I'm not.  But I'm not,  I'm not deluded  as to thinking  that I should be shooed away  when I'm not doing anything wrong.  It wasn't like I was standing there  waving at her  while she's being interviewed.  Then you go get the fuck out of here,  you lunatic.  But I wasn't doing that either.  It's like,  do you not think I've been around  enough of these people  where I'm not going to?  Even when Tom Brady  annoyed me so much, 
[00:46:00]  I would never  have been disrespectful to a,  I just wouldn't do it.  And I wouldn't ask  at a time with,  it drives you crazy.  Like Tribeca,  they took care of you.  Tribeca took great care of me.  They took great care of me.  Of course,  they took care of me.  And of course,  Sharon,  she gives you all access.  And the guy who works for Tribeca  took care of us  because he knew we were promoting it.  They just know what they're doing.  It comes down to  understanding and getting it. 
[00:46:30]  That ain't happening down that end.  That's what I'm saying though.  Getting what your guys are all about.  Doing that little extra thing  to keep them happy.  Believe it or not,  sometimes it's not about the money.  I think we got a really shitty deal.  I'll say it right until  the end of the contract.  But besides that,  it's not about money.  Sometimes it is that little thing.  Sometimes it is that thing going,  oh wait,  Jimmy from Mopey and Anthony.  Wow, yeah,  we all know he really likes  getting pictures with celebrities  and Lady Gaga.  Of course he's going to want one.  You know what?  I'm going to just do the right thing. 
[00:47:00]  And I'm going to make sure this happens.  Eric Logan would have done that.  Or if it can't happen,  how about treating the guy with a little...  But at least he tries.  How about treating the guy  with a little respect  if there's no way it could happen.  And instead of fucking  shooing him away  like a fucking janitor  with a mop  that is standing there  wanting to get a fucking signature  or a picture,  you treat him like  the fucking guy  that's on one of the top shows here.  And let me say too,  I really don't think  that I should be put above 
[00:47:30]  other people in the company  where they go,  you know what?  We said no to everybody,  but fuck them, Jim.  You're...  I understand that too.  But what annoyed me  was the fact  that it's like  I'm not just...  I have for like four days  I have made a couple of phone calls  to do it properly.  It's like I know how to do this.  You know how to play this game.  I know how to do it  where nobody is going to get upset.  Right.  And if it's a no,  it's a no.  I'm not going to stand there  and freak out.  But I was going through  all the proper channels  that had nothing to do  with SiriusXM. 
[00:48:00]  You're not just standing around here  waiting to get a picture.  That's what bothered me.  It's like...  If the person would have said to me  like, look,  today's really tense.  You can't just jump on.  I would have said,  no, no, no.  Here's what I'm doing.  And that would have been that.  I'm not a...  That's what made me so bothered.  What's the problem, man?  Lady Gaga doesn't give a fuck  about SiriusXM.  You got a little nugget  of gold yesterday,  but that's it.  It ends there.  Shoo.  It fucking ends there.  Shoo.  Shoo.  Yeah.  She's making pictures 
[00:48:30]  with her fans, though.  Yeah, yeah.  With the fans contest winners.  And I understand...  Again, you can't have  everybody at the company  lining up for a photo.  I get that.  I also hear that  Shoo Shoo guy  got a picture.  I honestly don't know  who did or didn't.  Right?  Isn't that true?  Oh, yeah, he did.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he did.  The guy that shooed you away,  he managed to get in there  and get a fucking picture.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he did.  Why wouldn't he?  Oh, yeah, he did.  Of course he did.  Do you remember  when Sting did that loot thing  and Elo brought us back there 
[00:49:00]  and it was like...  Literally, we were in and out.  It was a meet and greet.  So we were in and out  in 15 seconds.  Like, literally,  I said,  hide his thing.  A little longer  because my flash didn't go off.  You took an hour  and 20 minutes.  Robert Plant's giant head.  You know what?  Robert Plant,  when he did that thing  and Eric brought me  and you in and goes,  hey, guys,  just sit here and watch.  And it was like...  We didn't annoy Plant.  You and I together  took up about 15  or 20 seconds of his time  and he was fine with it.  We watched him perform.  Let's slow down with that  because it's very important.  Like, I'm a huge Zeppelin fan. 
[00:49:30]  Jimmy not so much  but understands the importance  of Robert Plant  in the music world.  So at the time  we're down in Washington,  we're like,  I asked.  I'm like,  I would love a picture  with Robert Plant  and then they said,  you know what?  They're going to be practicing  before they actually go live  on XM.  Would you guys want  to sit in on this?  And me and Jimmy  are like,  fuck yeah.  So it was just me and Jimmy.  I've told the story  a bunch of times  in two fucking chairs  10 feet from Robert Plant  with his band.  It was just us.  Yeah, that's great.  But Eric Logan went,  this is important  to Opie and Jimmy. 
[00:50:00]  I'm going to make  this happen.  Yeah.  That's what I'm trying  to say today.  And then we did get  our pictures as well.  Instead of being shooed.  Right.  And those little things  really meant a lot to me.  And Elo has been gone  for quite a while  and he's still a guy,  like I'm going to see him  when I'm in Chicago next week.  Him and his wife  are going to come to this show.  Like he's a real friend.  So you're not going to be  that close with everybody  who's in a management position.  Well, we didn't start out  being friends with him.  That's exactly it.  He was management.  We've been trained 
[00:50:30]  our entire careers  to hate management  because if they knew  what they were doing,  they would be doing  their own radio shows,  quite frankly.  But it's something with him  and how he treated us  and understood the show  and understood how  to push it forward  and understood the tiny  little things  that were important to us  went a long way.  Yeah.  And then you got this guy.  This guy.  But people have managed  to make this gig,  which I love.  I love coming here.  Yeah.  They've managed to make it  where I don't want 
[00:51:00]  to do anything extra.  Above and beyond.  Coming in.  It's amazing.  I've never been around  people who,  and I don't like to say  talent because the talent's arrogant,  but people just say  performers that were working for you.  I've never been around people  that reacted this way  to performers.  No.  It's mind-boggling.  I've gotten to the point  where I avoid  that part of the building,  and when I see certain people,  I barely not.  It's a radio sweatshop, 
[00:51:30]  this building.  Yeah.  It's just a sweatshop.  They just want you to come in.  If somebody fucking, you know,  gets their arm caught  in the machinery  and it gets ripped off,  eh, just get somebody else.  They don't care.  There's no real,  there's no real appreciation  for what an individual  does in this place.  No.  It's all about the collective,  and if one piece  of the fucking machine  is broken,  they know they could just go  and pop something else in,  maybe something of inferior quality,  and if that breaks,  they'll just get something else. 
[00:52:00]  That's how it works for you.  Well, that's what's slowly happening  because people  that really do have talent,  and there's still people here  that have talent, by the way,  because this will get around today,  they're leaving.  They're leaving for other gigs  or just saying,  you know what,  I don't need this.  Yeah.  I'll stay home with my family  for a while  until I figure out my next move,  and that's the problem  because then they're replacing  those people with,  you know,  kind of desperate people,  to be quite frank with you.  You know?  Yeah.  And eventually,  you're going to notice that  through your speakers. 
[00:52:30]  You're going to notice  that the quality  is drastically dropped.  Oh, yeah.  I have a solution  to the problem,  but I'm just waiting  for someone to come to me  and ask me.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it has to be,  you know.  One of those guys.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Oh, of course.  And that would solve everything.  But, uh...  Roland, you're all right.  Yeah.  You're all right?  Yeah, he's all right.  We'll talk to Glenn Close.  I told you.  It'll be great.  I told you on the end  we're talking to Glenn Close.  It'll be great.  I think Roland fucking  put some fake tears 
[00:53:00]  in front of us  to get it done.  No, he's frustrated as fuck  with all...  Roland, that's a joke.  And he should be.  All right.  And he should be.  And the Paris Hilton thing,  they should have never  beat you up about that.  You had nothing to do with that.  That's nothing to do with it.  They marched out of here  and fucked over the company  and then they go after you?  Get the fuck out of here.  It really...  The company reacted to that  the way a coyote reacts  when it's caught in a trap  just biting their own leg.  It's like,  how about you attack...  How about, as a group,  you show a little moral courage  and go after the publicist 
[00:53:30]  and say,  you know what?  That was inappropriate today.  Yeah.  We heard the tape.  Those guys did nothing wrong.  Your client came in here  very unwilling to do  a pretty friendly interview  and then marched out in a huff  and we're really aggravated.  And if your clients  are going to behave like that,  we don't want to take them.  How about you act?  Do that.  Why don't you...  Stick up for everybody  in the company.  Why don't you, for once...  Have a little moxie.  Defend your talent.  Defend your own people.  Who didn't do anything wrong. 
[00:54:00]  It's not like she walked in  with, hey, fuck you, porn bitch,  and then expect to be defended.  Right.  But when we don't do anything wrong  and you still  fucking act like you're  cowering before celebrities...  What are you doing?  I don't get that.  Fucking...  I'm a whore for celebrities.  I love them.  I fucking love them.  I know.  You really are.  Believe me,  I'm Arnold Anonymous  in my own mind.  You really are.  If you only knew  what a monumental failure  I feel like all the time.  Why do you think  I get photos with a guy  who did one episode  of Beretta? 
[00:54:30]  You were on Beretta in 76.  Can I bother you  for a picture, please?  Okay, when you're done.  Oh, now we got rolling upset.  This is like the easiest gig  in America.  Yeah, it really is.  But...  We'll be here for a little while.  I'll tell you that much.  We'll be here for a little while.  I honor contracts,  but fuck that.  Unbelievable.  Things will have to  drastically change.  That'll happen.  I'm serious. 
[00:55:00]  I mean, things will  drastically change.  Oh, I know.  That'll happen.  I already know  what this means in the end.  Trust me.  But until then,  we'll have a good time.  You alright, Roland?  Yeah.  Are you going to  power eat today?  Probably.  Pizza party?  Oh, yeah.  Pizza, pizza party.  Piece of ice cream  in my underwear.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds great.  It's fantastic.  Yeah, I gotta eat.  Yeah.  Let's all eat.  Yeah, let's eat.  And we'll come back 
[00:55:30]  and start the  Opie and Anthony show  instead of this  fucking shrink session  with these fucking assholes.  We might have enough  material to do  a cry show.  Really?  I don't know about that.  It always happens  in the first hour, too,  because people are  just waking up.  Hey, you wake up.  You're just fucking...  You're all...  You're just a disaster.  I hear you.  Jesus.  Alright.  Hey, we got a lot  of guests coming in today. 
[00:56:00]  The great Glenn Close  will be on our show today.  Yes.  We'll just do a very quick  Oscar nominee  and Emmy Award winner.  Yeah?  See, she was an Oscar nominee,  yet she won the Emmy.  I think three Emmys, right?  Something like that.  But three Emmys  don't equal one Oscar.  No?  If you melt this down?  Nah.  Who else we got?  She'll be in with the guys  from The Wire.  She'll come in while they're here.  I'm sure they won't mind.  We got The Wire guys  and we got Vincent D'Onofrio. 
[00:56:30]  Is that how you say his name?  D'Onofrio, yeah.  I always have a problem  with that.  It was Pyle from Full Metal Jacket.  He's on Law and Order.  People don't know.  He's been on Law and Order  for probably...  Many years, yeah.  At least ten, right?  I think he's the final season.  Yeah, final season.  He left and then he came back.  Huh?  Yeah.  You're doing a great job.  You shouldn't have to feel like this.  It's amazing.  It really is.  You shouldn't have to feel like this.  You're doing an amazing job.  No, you should never have to feel like this, ever.  And Blatter, we had a meeting with him recently  and he did say how just amazing you are  and how it's been great. 
[00:57:00]  So, all right.  And also, we got Anthony Wiener.  We have 11 pages of shit to go through.  Yeah.  And Andrew Breitbart is going to drop in  and give us a little more insight  on some of these transcripts,  where they came from.  What time is Breitbart coming?  Breitbart.  I believe nine.  I think it's Breitbart.  Yeah.  I think you're right, actually.  I think so.  I believe nine-ish.  And you want to feel old?  Oh, boy.  I'll do this before break.  Dakota Fanning. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah, I saw that.  Believe me.  Please.  Graduated high school.  Yes.  Holy shit.  A high school graduate.  Oh, my God.  And I believe she's pursuing her education  right here in New York.  NYU.  It's always NYU.  So, I got a shot.  Got a shot.  Got a shot.  Wow, she graduated high school.  What the fuck?  I know.  She was just a little tater tot  and now she's a high school graduate.  Her sister is an actress, too.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw her.  She kind of looks like the younger version of... 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  Well.  All right.  Too bad I didn't bring in those.  We could get her on the show.  Too bad I didn't bring in those puffs today, huh, Roland?  No, Dakota Fanning.  Not her 14-year-old sister.  Too bad I didn't bring in the puffs today.  Oh, God.  You would have been all about it.  I ate the whole box in 20 minutes.  I think Roland does a little of that stress eating.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  Stress eating?  Oh, yeah.  That cure whatever ails you.  Yeah, that's for sure.  Roland, you breathe and you go back down that hall. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get in your office, kick your feet up, take a few breaths.  That's right.  Relax.  And that's me that said that.  That's right.  Anyone has a problem, talk to me.  Hi.  When you need radio gold, he's the one that you call.  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small.  The one you can count on the book of guests for a session, but ends every single sentence  he says in a question.  No pronunciation, soft spoken and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic and he crumbles. 
[00:59:00]  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonna deuce, bonna deuce, check him out Friday wide.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, it's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, it's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, it's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, ah.  That's good. I mean, head action, suspense.  You, me, and Anthony, show me the entry of the virus, Sirius XM.  Ah, yes. 
[00:59:30]  That was fast.  It was a fast fucking stop set, as they used to say in the biz.  Threw some grub in my face and finished my V8.  Went back to the gym yesterday, finally.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Gets tougher and tougher, man.  Fucking joints hurt.  Just like, what happened?  Am I going to start looking at joints?  Medicine soon? 
[01:00:00]  My joints hurt.  I lift too much is the problem.  I've got to figure something else out.  Don't lift as much.  I know, but then I feel like nothing's happening.  You know?  But to get that fucking feeling of, I don't know, working out, I'd lift a lot for my stupid body size.  No one wants to hear this.  We got the warrior.  He put out a YouTube video exposing Hulk Hogan.  What?  Is this new?  We love the warrior audio.  Yes.  The ultimate warrior? 
[01:00:30]  Yes.  Jimmy went to the bathroom.  Ultimate warrior.  Do you want to do this, or you want to do, well, Jon Stewart fucking cut his wrist.  I guess that's a huge story now.  Why?  What?  How bad was Jon Stewart's cut last night?  He was doing some kind of bit, and he cut his hand.  Or on young Samuel?  Yeah.  He was doing a wiener bit, and he was doing a press conference, and he broke, he was making  mixed drinks while he was doing the press conference, and he broke one of the glasses,  and it cut, like, the bottom of his hand down to his wrist. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  No, not that far, really.  It was pretty far.  Wait, bottom of his hand...  Oh, you went to the elbow.  No, not to the elbow.  Did you see how Sam did that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So then I'm thinking, all the way to his elbow.  Okay, so the bottom of his hand to the wrist.  To his wrist.  There was probably, like...  Any stitches?  Maybe four inches.  I don't think there were stitches, because he...  Oh, right.  Wait, he scratched himself?  Bandaged it up and continued on with the show, but they left it in.  What audio did you give me?  Him cutting himself on the show?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:01:30]  Watch TV if you want to check that out.  10-10 wins played it.  I thought we should be up on the news, too.  10-10 wins.  You, hear it first.  Is that those guys?  Yeah, 10-10 wins.  You give us 22 minutes.  You give us 22 minutes.  We'll give you the world.  No, thank you.  I got Twitter.  I get my news from Twitter.  I don't need 22 minutes.  Everyone knows 10-10 wins in the whole world, if you watch Goodfellas.  Yeah.  Because that's the news station that's playing when Jimmy robbed the Lufthansa. 
[01:02:00]  That's the thing.  Right.  And Rilliot is in the shower, and he hears it on 10-10 wins.  Because he goes, it could be the biggest robbery ever.  If you come to New York, you're going to think it's like a movie radio station.  Right.  It's fake.  It was real, though.  It actually has been in quite a few movies, 10-10 wins.  Yeah, it's your go-to radio channel.  Yeah, it's your basic news thing.  I always wondered why we were never in a movie.  You guys aren't in an all-news station.  No, man, because they use other radio guys. 
[01:02:30]  I'm talking background shit.  I'm not saying, wow, we should actually be front and center.  But I always wonder why we were never coming out of a radio for a movie.  Well, we can ask a seasoned actress in a little while.  Glenn Close.  Yes.  I know you've been looking forward to that one.  Glenn Close will be on this very program.  Very excited.  I think officially this has become Glenn Closegate.  Glenn Closegate.  You have to add gate to shit, and then people get really interested.  Just call it Closegate.  Although, I really enjoyed when you suggested that I interview her and start with, oh, I 
[01:03:00]  thought you were a guy.  Your name was Glenn.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a good way to break the ice.  And she's older now, so she probably looks more like a male.  Okay, well, I don't know.  That's just...  Well, whatever that...  What is it?  What do they got?  What's their thing?  We got testosterone.  What do they have again?  They have that...  Estrogen.  Estrogen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That shit goes away, and then old women start looking like guys.  Starts to run out.  Oh, yeah, man.  Get on the train on a Wednesday from Huntington to New York City. 
[01:03:30]  For the matinee.  Is today a Wednesday?  Yeah, it's matinee day.  The matinee.  You'll see a lot of older women that I swear are more manly than a lot of guys walking  around New York City.  Oh, we're going tonight, brother.  You're going?  Yes.  Brother.  They gave me a ticket because Josh Gad, who we have tomorrow, wasn't in the one I saw.  But I think...  I mean, I still...  You're going to be the third wheel, though.  I don't think we're sitting together, though.  Why not?  I think this is the way to see...  This is sold out.  They have a line for cancellations.  Can we go down to the theater together? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  All right, good.  Do you think it'd be creepy if you and I sat together and we had your wife sit in the  other row so we could talk and we could laugh together?  Book of Mormon.  We're going again tonight.  Well, I didn't go yet, but Jimmy went.  And I'm happy to see it again.  I loved it.  Is that guy coming in tomorrow?  Josh Gad, yeah, tomorrow.  And he's nominated for Tony.  And he was sick the night I went, the day I went.  And I love the guy who replaced him, but he's supposed to be phenomenal.  What do you mean he's sick?  Oh, I think he has a throat thing with his throat. 
[01:04:30]  A throat thing with his throat?  He has a little coffee.  A foot thing with his foot.  Yeah, it was something to do with the brain.  They cut out a piece.  They gave him the old Nicholson in Cuckoo's Nest.  He had the Randall P. McMurphy.  What do you guys want to do?  Do you want to do Anthony Weiner shit?  Yeah.  Weiner.  And then we'll do the warrior stuff later.  What happened with the warrior?  I want to hear the ultimate warrior.  He's taken to social networks.  He's blaming.  What is he doing?  He doesn't like Hulk Hogan.  And what he said about Macho Megan.  All right, we got to do this now.  Fuck it.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  I really want to hear this.  Well, he started Twitter beef with Hulk Hogan.  Or Twitter beef.  Yes.  Wow, how the time's changed.  Can this guy wrestle anymore?  The warrior?  Yeah, if he had to.  He couldn't really wrestle to begin with, but he could probably do one match if he had to.  He couldn't wrestle to begin with.  No, he could never really wrestle.  But is he still in shape?  He still works out.  And he's still probably overroided up.  And Chyna sort of is wrestling, but now she's doing porn?  The thing about Chyna is...  What did she do?  She did a thing for TNA where she did one TV show and one pay-per-view, I think. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  She didn't look like she used to.  The definition, the muscle tone that...  She used to be ripped.  It's not there anymore.  Oh, wow, really?  She's a big woman, but it's not like...  The muscle tone.  And she wears like...  You know, she used to wear very revealing clothing so you could see all her muscles?  Yeah.  Like long pants and a full...  Oh, yeah.  A little looser now.  Yeah, it's not there.  A little loosey-goosey.  But then she's putting out a porno tape.  You sure that's not Khloe Kardashian?  I'm not. 
[01:06:00]  I can't be, I guess.  Dude, those two are starting to look very much alike.  Really?  Give me a split screen.  Khloe Kardashian, Chyna.  That's that square jaw.  Yeah.  They might be the same person.  She might be a Kardashian, Chyna.  And can we all admit that Khloe has a different father than the rest of them?  She has to.  There's no way.  Why doesn't anyone else in the media talk about this?  Kim and Kourtney.  You don't watch the Kardashians, right?  No.  Kim Kardashian is a small little thing. 
[01:06:30]  You've seen her in person.  How tall is she?  Yeah, she's a fidget.  She's probably 5'1", 5'2".  5'1".  And then you got...  Kourtney.  Kourtney.  How tall is she?  She's probably 5'2", 5'3".  And then Khloe, who looks like Chyna, is pushing six foot tall.  Yeah, 6'4", 200 pounds.  She is so much bigger than the rest of them.  And they're also like...  I wonder where that comes from.  Another father.  Are they going to ever admit that?  The other two are gorgeous and she is not.  What happened?  Just reading. 
[01:07:00]  Okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Those things.  Oof.  All right.  Should we do that instead of Warrior?  Dude, I'm not against Warrior, but Warrior's not about to have to be forced out of office.  Okay.  But before we move on, look at that, Ant.  Yeah, yeah.  Khloe is a head taller than her sisters with different color hair, different skin type.  Different face.  Different everything.  Yeah, that's odd.  I'm going on record.  I think she has a different father.  She's got to.  The other two look like sisters.  How do we get that quote out there? 
[01:07:30]  Huh?  I'll have somebody type up a press release.  And they have a brother that looks like the two sisters.  Yes.  And then you've got Khloe that doesn't look like any of them to that extent.  She looks like the friend that's ruining the picture.  Right.  And looking more and more like Chyna every day.  Lamar Odom likes it, though.  Lamar is pussy whipped.  Yeah, I know.  He really is.  I've seen it on the show.  I watch enough where Khloe's like, oh, you're going to go play that basketball thing?  Okay, have fun.  Have fun.  He plays for the Los Angeles Lakers.  She treats it like a hobby. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Another black guy.  Yeah.  He's.  Oh.  What's going on in there?  No, I was just saying, Khloe had a nip slip on Fox the other day.  I just threw it up on the TV there if she wanted to take a look.  That's racist.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  I got to get it.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Big and pink.  Yeah, but usually you think that's hot.  I just went, ugh.  No, if you chop her head off, and I don't mean like figuratively.  I mean, get an axe to chop her head off.  Oh, she's got the kind of nipple I like.  Yeah, yeah.  They slow fade pink boys.  Yeah, you're slow fade too, right? 
[01:08:30]  Ah, a lot like Tracy Lord tits.  Yeah.  It looks like her fucking, like her tit is wearing a giant pink yarmulka.  Like she has big Jewish breasts.  She's sleeping on the plane.  They're praying at the front of it.  Big, big orthodox tits.  I want to lick them and make yummy noises.  You're right.  If you cut off the china head, that's actually a nice nip.  You're right.  Yeah, that's nice.  Can't hate on that.  No, you can't get on that.  And she's rogue in that family too, which makes me think that she has a different father.  Who do you think the father is?  Maybe Bruce Jenner? 
[01:09:00]  She does look a little more like Bruce Jenner than the others.  So maybe the mom...  How old is she?  She's older than the other two, isn't she?  Yeah, she looks a little older.  So?  Oh, shit.  You think there's some shit going on with Bruce Jenner?  I think something's going on.  It's my dumb opinion.  I don't know shit.  But I think the mainstream media's got to get to the bottom of this.  I'm...  Ant, look at the picture again.  And then we'll get on to Anthony Weiner.  On the screen here with the sisters.  Hang on one sec.  Okay. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, that's Lady Gaga.  Who?  Lady Gaga's nipple slit.  Jesus.  I heard she looked good in her hot shorts yesterday too.  She's alright.  Oh, fuck.  Are you sorry?  Yeah, she wasn't wearing much.  She's sexy, man.  There is a dress code right here.  I'm going to HR.  Yeah.  I'm going to tell them that.  I was offended.  That's hilarious.  By Lady Gaga walking around with nothing on.  My eyes are not garbage cans.  Why is it okay?  Ant, look at that picture.  You're better at shit than me.  Look at this.  Yeah.  Look at the two sisters. 
[01:10:00]  They almost look like twins.  How old is she?  Let me find some ages.  About.  Wow.  Chloe?  Yeah.  Has this ever been brought up on the show?  Not that I've seen.  Really?  Because I'm saying.  Why don't they do a whole season about this?  I'm saying it could be Robert Shapiro.  That's what I'm thinking.  Wow.  Really?  I'm thinking, yeah.  When.  Chloe is 26, it says. 
[01:10:30]  She doesn't.  She looks like an old 26.  Yeah.  I think Kim Kardashian's the oldest.  She's 30, right?  30, 31, maybe?  Yes.  30-ish?  And then.  Maybe OJ.  And Kourtney.  Maybe it's OJ as her father.  OJ slipped it to fucking Kardashian's wife.  Yeah.  Kim is 30.  Mm-hmm.  So Kim and Robert, uh, Kardashians.  Yeah, that, that makes sense.  Oh, I think she's the oldest. 
[01:11:00]  I think Kourtney's the oldest.  Kourtney is 32.  Wow.  So you got a 32-year-old, a 30-year-old, and then a 26-year-old.  Okay, so the 26, okay.  She looks pretty good, though.  Kourtney's the hottest, I think.  I prefer Kim.  I always thought that.  Certainly an argument to have.  I always thought Kourtney was higher.  Certainly an argument to have.  Yeah, it's not undisputed.  But Kourtney is a dud.  As far as personality goes.  There's Gaga showing off her nipples.  Oh, look at that.  Ew.  You know why? 
[01:11:30]  Because she's got that stocking top on, so it looks like crooks when they go to rob a  bank and pull a stocking over their face.  That's what her tits look like.  Ma, give me that money, see?  Ma, get that kid with the camera out of here, see?  It was a bit of a faux pas yesterday, because she was wearing the same wig that she wore  the night before.  Oh, why would she do that?  Is she running out of ideas?  See, that's what she looked like yesterday.  Wow.  Oh, that's from yesterday.  Hey, getting back to China. 
[01:12:00]  Mike from Michigan, Back Door to China is already out.  That's the porn?  That's the porno tape.  He writes, and in scene three, China takes it up the shitter.  Well, that's why it's called Back Door to China.  She takes it up the shitter.  But if your movie's going to be called Back Door to China, wouldn't that be the grand  finale that you finally take it up the shitter?  I guess.  Shoot.  How many scenes are you going to get through?  Yeah.  She's taking it from real porno stars, though, now.  It's not like a homemade tape.  It's like she made a porn movie. 
[01:12:30]  No X-Pac going in there.  X-Pac is not a part of this film.  No.  No.  Where's X-Pac?  X-Pac, there are rumors that he may actually be getting a job with WWE.  Wow.  Working with the developmental kids, the up-and-comers.  Yeah, the up-and-comers.  There's also an article on TMZ that he was molested as a child.  Oh, wow.  But I got the scoop on that.  Look out.  Hey, Anthony Wiener, thank you, sir.  Yeah, the Wiener.  Oh, my God.  But I don't want to forget about Khloe maybe having another father.  I don't think any of us can. 
[01:13:00]  All right, good.  But we got to move on to Anthony Wiener.  This guy is done.  Yeah, these are some of the...  Oh, go ahead, sweetie.  Go ahead, pull it out.  You think he...  There's more transcripts coming out, more sexting, another porn star that can't keep her mouth  shut that ran to TMZ with shit.  Of course.  You think this guy actually had sex with these women?  I don't know.  Because they're all almost laughing at him that he's ruining his life and his career,  and he didn't even have sex with these women.  He's all sexting.  He might not have, because he's such a busy dude, he's always gone. 
[01:13:30]  He might just be a computer jack-off guy.  It's very possible that he's just...  But then again, he's lied before, but he's just a computer jack-off dude.  So he may just be jerking off online.  And there's rumors that his wife and Hillary...  Huh?  Yeah, it's mixed around here and there.  It might be a big cover-up, don't they?  Oh, really?  Well, am I allowed to say what I've read online? 
[01:14:00]  You've read it.  No?  You don't know.  It's allegations.  I don't know.  It's been alleged.  You know what I'm talking about.  By certain publications.  Right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Transcripts from Facebook conversations between Anthony Weiner and Las Vegas blackjack dealer  Lisa Weiss.  We did this one yesterday.  Or is this new shit?  Oh, this is new.  Should we start from the beginning, Jimmy?  You've been reading this.  Yeah, the beginning is not much, although it just makes you hate people because they save  everything and they run to Radar.  Radar Online is corny.  They block out curses, but then they block out things like the word harder. 
[01:14:30]  Come on, you fucking idiots.  Me and Anthony Weiner have something in common.  We've both been fucked over by blackjack dealers.  See, get it?  What do you mean?  He's not getting...  Oh, that's right.  Wow.  Transcripts from Facebook conversations.  Yeah.  It gets really good.  A couple of pages and...  Oh.  Can we start from the top? 
[01:15:00]  We could race through this shit.  Sure.  These are easy pages to read.  Bold text is from Anthony Weiner.  Weiner.  And normal text is from Miss Weiss.  Yeah.  So she starts.  Well, should Miss Weiss read it?  Oh, come on in here.  Does he have a copy?  No.  I got a copy over here.  He could grab mine.  I like the surprise.  I'm not reading it.  It's like a movie.  Ooh. 
[01:15:30]  This worked out great yesterday.  So playing the part of Lisa Weiss will be E-Rock.  The beginning is not really...  It's more her.  He's not saying anything.  No, he's feeling it out.  Yeah.  Feeling it out.  Seeing if it's safe ground.  Putting the old hook in the water, right?  Yes.  Yes.  This is August 13th, 2010.  You don't have to highlight yours.  It's not in bold.  You don't have to be off book. 
[01:16:00]  Highlighting.  Highlighting.  Highlighting.  Yeah, there's no cameras filming you.  Keep your eyeline steady.  I don't want to read 11 pages of it, but it's...  Why not?  Okay.  This is unbelievable.  Okay, go ahead.  I guess we could skip around a little bit.  You're right.  But at least start from the top and then to get a feel for this shit.  Is it actually you?  Am I trying to find the wonderful Anthony Weiner who I fell in love with for yelling at those 
[01:16:30]  damn Republicans the other day?  And you are funny as hell on The Daily Show.  Your friend requests are full.  You must friend me.  You're awesome.  Is this really, Lisa?  It is you.  I am honored to be your Facebook friend.  You are the coolest dem on the planet.  They need to all be as tough as you.  And you are damn funny.  Keep fighting for the sane people in this country.  Thank you, Lisa. 
[01:17:00]  Glad you have my back.  You keeping an eye on that wackadoodle angle for us?  How insane is she?  Who needs Social Security, Medicare, or education?  If this wacko wins my state, I swear I'll have to move.  She may be dumber than plain.  Okay.  Dumber than, okay.  She may be dumber than plain.  Oh, I guess.  She meant Palin.  Oh.  Plain.  Ah, right.  And that is tough to find. 
[01:17:30]  Mm-hmm.  There's nothing here.  It's more just politics.  Okay.  I would like to throw this aside in.  Yeah.  By the way, I believe E-Rock messaged Travis right before this and told him he's got to  take a massive shit.  Yeah.  So E-Rock is doing this with your shit backing up in him.  Don't push.  There's some rumbling going on.  Are you playing bingo in your underpants right now?  I'm following it through the intestinal tract. 
[01:18:00]  You got a stiffy, though, that's having a tough time going around the bend?  It's not stiff.  A lot of gurgling.  Pages of script.  All right.  Let's go.  Oh, God.  This is superhero talk.  All right, Jimmy.  Where should we go?  I would say September 20th, the second page, E-Rock.  All right.  Let's go to that.  The rest of it was politics more or less?  Yeah, it's boring.  It's like, you know, it's like make me an offer I can't refuse.  I'll watch you on the Daily Show, that type of shit.  Go to September 20th, right about there.  Wiener starts. 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  Computer backup.  No sense in you being clever if nobody can read it.  Good morning.  Hi, honey.  Computer's back up.  What's up with you?  Busy saving my country from this fucking teabaggers?  Yep.  Cape tights.  Looking for my sidekick.  Ugh.  Oh.  And then the next day it continues.  Oh.  I bet you look hot in tights.  Can I be your sidekick?  Get your ass to Vegas.  Stop staring at my weapon. 
[01:19:00]  I'm affecting the Vegas trip.  This whole re-election thing is keeping me tied up.  I can't wait to meet you in person.  And I'll stare at your weapon if I want to.  Damn it.  I understand this re-election stuff may take some time.  But I really feel my needs are way more important.  What is kind of funny is that I was looking at my Facebook page for something.  And I had posted that I wanted to bang you like a month ago.  I think it was after you called Lieberman a prick. 
[01:19:30]  Not...  Now that was hot.  I'm all about your needs, believe me.  A month ago, did my moment pass?  No.  That was before I even knew you were so damn funny.  Sign on to Facebook, Chad.  I'm dying of boredom over here.  Plus my tights really itch.  I need a distraction.  Oh, Jesus.  This is...  Next day, right? 
[01:20:00]  Oh, no.  We move forward to the 22nd.  Oh, yeah.  Next day.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  I am drunk and thinking about you.  Oh, no.  Drunken.  What have you done you've done to me?  I am being bold and leaving you my number.  Call me.  I am super drunk right now.  Oops.  And Zoo want to talk to you.  Am I a Facebook stalker?  Am I allowed to drunk dial a congressman? 
[01:20:30]  I think you're so totally hot.  And you're lucky if I don't have your number right now.  Have I missed this chance to rock your world by phone or something?  Give me not a chance.  Stalk me, baby.  Very hot.  23rd.  So glad you were cool with me stalking you.  Didn't want you to call Homeland Security on me.  No, we have a special secret agency that deals with hot women.  Oh, God.  Oh, look at him.  He's using his fucking secret hot agency. 
[01:21:00]  Nothing.  Okay.  Let's go to September 28th, the bottom of the page.  Because he has nothing.  All right.  Whoa.  Super intense dream about you just now.  Woke me up.  Yeah, sure.  That is fucking awesome.  Don't know.  I, you are still up.  But we really need to discuss this further.  That's the sweetest thing anyone has said to me in a while.  Sweet.  Sweet.  Well, she's a blackjack dealer.  They probably say, you cunt. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  And get this bitch out of here.  She's bad luck.  No tip for you.  Anything people say to her is nice.  Hey, I bet your pussy doesn't stink.  Oh, you, you sweetie.  21 again.  21 again?  You fucking piece of shit.  Stalk me, please.  Make me come all over your superhero outfit, please.  Damn.  You either went back to sleep or to work saving the world. 
[01:22:00]  You see why I need your number when you leave me such good messages?  Nope.  Not sweet.  Crazy dirty.  I know.  I want all the dirty details.  Baby, you have to post some fresh pictures.  Ah, yes.  This is all.  The next stuff is not.  It gets kind of dirty.  Wow.  It gets kind of dirty on the next page.  Go to March 3rd.  March 3rd.  March 3rd.  All right.  So there's a pretty big gap.  Yeah.  You on here?  Hey, sexy. 
[01:22:30]  What's up, baby?  Hold on.  Let me look.  Whoa.  Looks like I am.  Want to ride it?  Hard for me?  You like me big and fat?  That should be your line.  Really?  Stupid tubby.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Only your cock.  Your pussy's still tight and wet for me, baby?  Yes.  Getting drunk and about to bang my fuck friend till you get here. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  A fuck friend.  He will take some dirty pics of me.  Think of my rock hard cock.  Practice saying, God, Anthony, I'm coming again.  Ew.  Ew.  Oh, my God.  Ew.  Ew.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  That's rough.  I will do that.  Unless you want to be on this program, then practice saying, God, Anthony, there's so 
[01:23:30]  many Jews in your neighborhood.  What can we do about it?  Sorry.  I will do that for you.  Waiting it out till you get here and fuck the shit out of me.  Where did you go, Anthony?  Shower.  Still hard.  Thinking of you on me while I kiss your tits.  Hold you down and take you deep.  I'm about to bang my friend because you're not here.  We'll call him Anthony.  I hope he has a big cock.  Huge.  You're going to have to up him. 
[01:24:00]  Get here.  You will gag on me before you come with me in you.  Holy shit.  He's so fired.  He's finger fucking right now.  He's finger fucking right now while I type this.  Nose, I love you.  Off to class.  Picks.  Soon.  Get here, god damn it.  I must have your cock.  That was isolated.  He wants some pictures.  Okay, let's go to March 16th. 
[01:24:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  You on here?  Hello, Lisa.  Hey, baby.  Sent you a message the other day, but I think it went to instant chat for some odd reason.  Ah, I missed it.  Sorry, sweetie.  No problem.  I was so psyched to see you on Colbert.  You were so funny.  You watch it naked?  You watch it naked?  What a fucking dope.  Of course.  You need to let me know when you're going to be on TV.  I keep missing you. 
[01:25:00]  You don't get my Twitter feed?  Arrow towards him.  Feelings hurt.  Ew.  Teenage girl.  We have audio from her.  Hey, I'm just calling to apologize.  In a way, thank you.  Sometimes I've been angry and regretted meeting you and the heart that you have caused me and tried to cause me.  But I've decided to take all that and turn it into something good.  And I've met someone who's actually a recovering alcoholic and has given me some insight on myself. 
[01:25:30]  Hey, good.  Shut up.  Right.  No, no.  That's an old one.  I haven't heard from that in probably a month now.  Thank God.  Someone else is burdened with that.  All right.  Go ahead.  Where were we with the...  After feelings hurt.  Yeah.  I do.  And I'm still waiting for your...  I'm still waiting for your bar mitzvah pictures? 
[01:26:00]  Bar mitzvah?  Bar mitzvah.  Bar mitzvah with a B.  I know that.  She made a mistake.  Who is she?  Fucking Webster?  You're acting like she's the be-all end-all in the spelling world.  Whoa.  Hang out.  You guys are supposed to be a couple.  Sorry.  We fight sometimes.  She's literal.  All right.  I do.  And I'm still waiting for your bar mitzvah pics.  But I don't get on Twitter every day.  So I don't always get to catch your hot face on all your shows.  Ah.  Ah.  I ran the bar mitzvah pics by Zeray. 
[01:26:30]  Oh.  I can't wait to see it.  I will go there before bed.  You are so awesome when you yell at those Fox News fucks.  The clips are awesome.  I'm glad you like.  Are you as passionate in the sack as you are about politics?  Oh.  I'm getting bored with my fuck friend.  Baby.  You'd be crawling for the door to prevent me from fucking you silly.  Silly.  I'm going to fuck you until you have googly eyes.  I made that part up. 
[01:27:00]  I'm going to fuck you so much.  Oh my God.  What a hack.  He really is.  Nice.  Just what I'm looking for.  I want to bang the future mayor of New York City.  Make me hard.  I wanted to bang the other one.  But he wanted nothing to do with me because I have a vagina.  Sorry.  Make me hard.  I love that you're always hard when I talk to you.  I'm horny a lot.  Sorry.  Me too.  You have that effect on me.  He makes you cum?  Sometimes. 
[01:27:30]  But he's not as hot as you.  He tells me I'm too wild for him.  He can't handle me.  I bet you can handle anything.  I want to feel you cum with my cock in you.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, I want that so bad.  I'm so attracted to you.  I would probably cum in like five minutes.  When am I going to get some Lisa Pitch to jerk off to?  I think Jimmy's auditioning for our fucking whole producers that might be listening to us right now. 
[01:28:00]  It's hilarious.  He's just yelling.  I love the yelling.  Very angry.  Yelling dirty text.  He wanted to take some the other day, and I was going to send them to you, but it was too dark, and they didn't show up.  I was actually drunk enough to let someone take naked pics of me.  Going to the bathroom mirror now.  I'm like a rock.  You know, I got no camera.  I would touch your giant cock for me.  It needs your pussy juice.  I have lots of that. 
[01:28:30]  This guy is so done.  Ah ha ha.  It needs pussy juice.  Off to the shower.  This thing is bobbing up and down.  Ah, I wish I was in the shower with you to help.  You give good head.  I've been told really good.  I love doing it.  Wow, a Jewish girl who sucks cock.  I think this thing is ready to do damage.  And swallows every drop.  God damn, how do I get you here to fuck me?  Arrow pointing to the left.  Thinking about gagging your hot mouth with my cock? 
[01:29:00]  Well, he's lost all the female potential motors.  Oh, he's so done.  The anticipation of fucking you is driving me crazy.  Come here to Vegas so I can suck your cock for an hour.  You must be in the shower.  I am getting very nice visuals before bed.  I'll probably have some filthy dreams about you.  Again.  Clean, but still hard.  That was fast.  You don't take care of that hard-on for... 
[01:29:30]  You didn't take care of that hard-on for me.  I want to hear...  I want to hear you cum so bad.  I'm pretty chatty.  Noisy in bed.  Me too.  This is such a turn-on to me.  I'll be telling you what dirty things I'm thinking.  I love that.  I talk like a filthy whore in bed.  Even though I'm such a nice, wholesome Jewish girl.  I love when a guy jerks off on the phone for me.  That is so hot.  I at least need to hear your voice when you cum. 
[01:30:00]  You will surely make noise when I take you deep.  I will tell you how tight your pussy feels.  Yes, I will.  And it's very tight.  I hope you can handle that big cock of yours.  I hope I can handle that big cock of yours.  I will be sore for days.  Ridiculous bulge in my shorts right now.  Want to see?  Yeah, can you send a pic?  I want to see your cock so bad right now.  Jeez!  Well, a little... 
[01:30:30]  It's sit.  Oh, I want to sit on your cock so bad right now.  What does that want to shit on your cock?  This isn't from my computer.  Good.  She wants to sit on it, yeah.  Jeez!  I'm rushing!  Let me take a quick pic.  Awesome.  How do I get it?  Right on here?  Where are you going to work?  How are you going to work with a raging heart on?  It won't go away!  And I'm taking pics of it, making me harder still.  So what?  You're making me wet again. 
[01:31:00]  Jeez!  I have to go!  I'll hit you later!  Oh, you better.  And that means he probably...  He blew a load into a napkin and is done with this blackjack-dealing dumbbell.  And before we move on, a question.  You think she was setting him up here, or she was just into this?  No, I think she was probably into it.  I doubt she...  She might have been setting him up, because she keeps asking for pics for video, but she's  obviously lying about having taken pics for him.  That guy was not finger-banging her while she was saying it.  That was all bullshit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was all bullshit to...  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  She was basically talking about him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was bullshit.  In the third party.  All right.  Where are we going now, Jimmy?  April 5th?  Or no?  Um, I would say April...  Oh, 17th.  I see a cock-sucking in there.  That's April 7th.  I mean 7th.  Yeah, go to the bottom.  7th.  Okay.  Catching up on my daily shows, did you know you were the moment of zen?  You were so funny with your wiener-boner joke.  You were too cute.  Bonner. 
[01:32:00]  Go ahead.  Bonner.  Get your ass to work and save my country from these cock-sucking repubs.  I like when you talk about cock-sucking.  These fuckers are pissing me off.  Yep.  I love that you bought the Dr. Seuss book.  Something on my level.  You were so cute.  Will you punch Bonner in the head for me, please?  Tony, where are you?  Sorry.  I was punching the speaker.  He was fucking punching the clown.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  That's it.  Right on.  Have you been up for days?  Will you hire me to be your fluffer?  You would be good at that.  Your little pick makes me hard.  I am so into you.  Ah, my little Japanese girl.  You have no idea.  Oops, my grandma is suffering from my wine.  I love that you're so hot and such a liberal.  I was hoping my fat cock would be the selling point. 
[01:33:00]  Me too.  Yes.  It is so.  Yes, it is.  I so want to fuck the shit out of you.  I want to get you on a plane right now and bang me.  Hard!  Will you call me right now?  And we can have phone sex?  Getting into the shower!  Call me when you get out.  He fucking blew another...  That showers a lot, yeah.  He blew another load.  Blew another load.  He's a little scared of using the phone, I think.  Of course.  He's not...  How much is he...  Because he probably always thought I could just say I was hacked. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Well, there are some emails and whatnot that he told some girl what to say if she was approached  by authorities.  And they were lies.  Okay.  He told her to lie.  Let's just go to the next one.  The 29th?  13th.  13th.  No, 13th.  Hey, you.  Why, hello.  Don't you ever sleep?  Uh, it's nine here.  My Lisa time. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, I love that I need some Anthony time.  You must be working again.  Thought it was my time.  All right, let's go to the 29th.  You on here?  Hey, baby.  Hi, honey.  How have you been?  Out!  About!  The usual!  Miss me?  Yes.  Yes, what are you doing up so late?  Dunno.  Wake up sweat...  Dunno.  Woke up sweaty and hard.  Nice.  Will you have a hot dream?  I don't remember!  But looking down, I'd say yes. 
[01:34:30]  I love that you're always so horny.  Am I ever actually going to get to fuck you?  Would that be good?  I imagine you rocking my world.  I would love to.  The anticipation is killing me.  I keep going back to your page looking for new pics to get off to.  I do need to get some.  I keep seeing you on TV, and you are so sexy.  Hey, are you Facebook two-timing me?  Yeah.  Big time.  You Facebook slut.  Guilty! 
[01:35:00]  I bet you have so many chicks after you.  You are our liberal stud.  Tonight, I'm just a man with a raging hard-on.  I wish I was there to fuck the shit out of you.  I need it.  Do you ever get to Vegas?  I just need to have you for one night.  I have to.  Will you really?  I know you're a great fuck.  I have never wanted to bang someone so bad whom I've never met. 
[01:35:30]  I'm so fucking hard right now.  I want to sit on your big cock.  I hope that's the way you like them.  Of course.  I know you're a huge.  Had so many dirty dreams about you.  Are you jerking off to another Facebook girl?  Maybe we need a Facebook three-way.  Nah.  Actually fading off.  Are you going to sleep without taking care of your cock for me?  Taking him to bed.  Good night, sexy.  Good night, baby.  Get your hot ass to Vegas.  And again, he fucking shot the load. 
[01:36:00]  And again, he just shot the load.  Where's the shooting of the load?  I'm out.  Right before he says goodbye, shower, there's a fire in the hotel room, I have to make a hat.  Listen, I'm polishing my felt hat feather.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.  He said, I hope that's the way you like them.  Big and hard.  Yeah.  And then as she's saying, of course, I know you're huge.  That's when he was blurking.  Believe me.  His fucking knees were hitting the bottom of the desk as he was dumping his load all over.  His Congress belly button.  By the time he said, nah, actually fading off, that means his cock was looking sickly. 
[01:36:30]  Lisa's memories were curled up in a fucking Holiday Inn napkin because he missed the garbage can because he's too tired to make his cumsies going to the garbage can.  Oh, on my birthday.  Oh.  On my birthday, May 23rd.  Oh, it just says, what's up, stranger?  That's it?  That's all I get for my birthday?  Dude, that's a lot of fucking.  But you know what?  As much as this is a lot of stuff.  Oh, wait.  And now she jumps. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, wow.  This is interesting, actually.  May 31st.  Lisa goes, oh, my God, are you OK?  This is when the news broke.  Oh, wow.  With the picture in the shorts.  The first picture, obviously.  Oh, my God.  Are you OK?  So sorry you got hacked.  I know you would never do anything like have Facebook sex or take pics of your cock.  Who is who is the bitch who rad you out?  I am the only Facebook chick you can trust.  Yeah, right.  He never wrote back, obviously.  And then she tried again the next day.  You owe me big time for keeping this all quiet.  Now she's getting pissed. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, shit.  That's why this is important.  June 1st, she writes, you owe me big time for keeping this all quiet.  I'm defending you to the death on every blog and to everyone, telling everyone you would  never send dirty messages to women.  I know you haven't been on here since you were hacked, but I need to talk to you.  Someone contacted me about you.  Call me or something.  And he didn't respond to that.  Oh, boy.  And then all of a sudden, and she's like, well, fuck you.  Fuck you, Wiener.  This is what I do.  She was protecting him.  And then she's the one that ends up making it way worse for him.  You know what, though?  Reading all this stuff is a lot of it. 
[01:38:00]  But none of this is anything other than just guy dirty talk.  What you're seeing this guy in his most private moments.  Right.  There's nothing that dirty.  It's like he just wants to fuck this chick and he's jerking off to her.  People don't like seeing that, though, from their politician.  And they don't like the lying.  Yeah, no, I understand that.  But he's not saying, I wish you were 15.  It's all wrong for some people.  I wish you were 15.  He's not saying that or he's like, you're a little girl.  Let's get an animal in it. 
[01:38:30]  Like, even in his most private moments, for people to throw him under the bus for this  after he admitted it, this is not that bad.  He's just a guy whacking off on the road on a computer.  There's a lot worse than he could be doing.  He could be getting fucking hookers.  He's not getting hookers.  To me, even though it's a lot of dirty stuff, it will probably ultimately hurt him.  It shouldn't.  It's going to.  Yeah, I know.  It shouldn't.  He's done.  It was the lying and saying it was hacked.  I was hacked.  It's not me.  I don't know what happened.  E-Rock, good job.  Good job.  Wow, E-Rock.  Go to the ladies' room.  Look at him running down the hall. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, he's running.  He's sweating.  Drop that fucking pile of stew into the toilet.  He had fucking dump sweats.  Yeah, the whole time.  Dump sweats were flowing.  Wire guys here yet?  No, I don't think so.  I haven't been told.  Oh, boy.  Who said they would be late?  I did.  You're right.  It's 8 o'clock.  Give yourself a fucking bell.  It's 8 o'clock in the morning.  Hit that fucking bell for yourself.  So why don't we take a break?  We got a chance to do that.  Yes, take a quick break.  Back back, we got a bunch of the Wire guys coming by to talk about the paintball Saturday things. 
[01:39:30]  Saturday morning, J.D. Williams, who played Bodie.  Chad Coleman, who played the boxing coach, who was the gangbanger, who wound up not being able to pull the trigger, which was a great moment.  And, of course, Jamie Hector, who is Marla Stanfield.  And a lot of people are asking, why am I not playing paintball with my pals Jimmy and Ann?  I have something else going on this weekend that I can't get out of.  I would love to fucking do that.  He's playing paintball with the Sopranos.  That's right.  I would love to paintball with you guys and the Wire guys.  This sounds like it's going to be great.  I've never played.  And teams should still get involved? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I'm going to see.  We have a couple people on our team, but I'm going to see if maybe we can do something.  We'll have to figure it out where we can maybe get somebody, one of the listeners in with us or two of the listeners in with us.  You should do that.  And as individuals, you can still buy in.  You don't have to be a team to do it.  You don't have to need five friends to do it because they'll just pair you with other people.  They'll put you with a team, yeah.  Yeah.  If you're an individual, you can still join up.  We'll give you all the details.  All right.  We'll figure it all out next.  Stay there.  This is the Opinion Show.  Opinion Show. 
[01:40:30]  Opinion Show.  Opinion Show.  Opinion Show.  Sirius XM.  Way down in a hole.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Fire in the fury.  That's right.  We got the Wire guys.  Yeah, they're probably in the elevator.  On their way up, yo.  So, Jimmy, help me out.  Jamie Hector was Marlo?  Marlo, of course.  Okay, good.  Jamie Williams was up.  Bodie?  Yes.  Wait, I want to go three for three.  Oh, yeah.  Chad Coleman.  This is going to be a tough one.  Politician? 
[01:41:00]  Nope.  Fuck.  He was great.  Yeah.  His name was Cuddy.  Oh, Cuddy.  Yeah.  You remember?  Yeah.  He was a fucking Cuddy.  He was a gangbanger who was sent out to commit a murder, and he just couldn't pull the trigger.  He did it.  Pointed the gun at him.  It's just kind of like, yeah.  That was a great scene.  Well, I'll tell him when he comes in.  I'm just going to wipe repeating myself like an ass.  He should have shot that little motherfucker.  Oh, that fucking fruit. 
[01:41:30]  That kid's name was Fruit.  Fruit.  That he should have shot.  He wasn't.  He got killed anyway, though.  Yeah, yeah.  He did.  He got his comeuppance.  Yes, he did.  Oh, Cuddy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I said yeah without knowing.  I think people knew that.  So I had to Google it.  Yeah, of course I know who he is.  Yes, he's fantastic.  He wasn't in a lot of episodes, and then he was the guy that ran the boxing gym.  Yeah, he was.  Trying to get the kids on the straight and narrow.  Straight and narrow.  I believe he entered in season three.  Fuck yeah, I remember him.  I think he entered season three, or was it season four? 
[01:42:00]  It might have been season four.  I think it was season four.  Oh, great, because I only have season three with me, so he'll be signing season three.  It's all I have.  I just said I think it was season four.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  Well, ask him.  Sometimes I'll luck out.  I don't know why we're speculating when these guys will be here very shortly.  By the way, I was thinking during break, before the Wire guys get in here, if Glenn Close  gives us any bit of attitude today, I feel sorry for Glenn Close.  Yes.  I think she'll be great, but you're right. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, God.  After what we've been through with this booking and all this shit that's been going on, if  she gives us one iota of attitude.  Oh, fuck.  Could you imagine?  No.  The old I don't want to even fucking.  Game over.  If she gives the old I don't want to even fucking be here vibe.  Game over.  Game over.  After all that, and we have to sit through an I don't want to be here vibe.  We will tell her to her face that we didn't even want her on the show. 
[01:43:00]  Oh.  I'll bet you she's great, though.  She'll be good.  The fact that I met her at Dane's thing, at least she's a comedy fan, so.  Was that in Boston?  It was in Boston when he shot, yeah.  You were at that, weren't you?  Yeah.  I guess I don't care as much.  Did we really meet Glenn Close?  I was with you the entire time, so I must have.  Yeah, a couple of the Red Sox were there.  When we went backstage, and it was just a who's who of people checking out Dane Cook's  taping of, was that his first HBO?  I do not know.  That was.  Jimmy was so depressed that day because Dane Cook had two sold out shows at whatever they 
[01:43:30]  call it now.  Boston Garden, yeah.  Yeah, the old Boston Garden.  We're leaving the first show that was just amazing, and there's 15,000 people waiting to  come in.  They're turning around the Boston Garden for a second show on the same night.  Yeah.  He did that at the Garden, too.  He did that a few times, right?  Well, you know what?  A guy like Dane removes your excuses.  Kevin Hart does, too.  So does Aziz.  Guys that are selling 2,000 and above, because every community, Louie is selling everywhere  out.  And we all like to go, well, you know, man, it's the economy. 
[01:44:00]  Really?  What, the Dane's fans don't have to deal with the economy?  Of course they do.  If people want to see you badly enough, they come out to see you.  So when you see that, you realize that people will come out to see a show.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's not like, if you see Dane doing 1,500 people out of 10,000, you look like the economy  is shitting the bed.  Yeah, yeah.  When you see Dane doing 35,000 out of 35,000, it's possible.  It was amazing.  I think...  It was a great show.  Roland is opening the door, and... 
[01:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  What's up, Jamie?  Jamie, how are you doing, man?  Thanks for coming back, Jamie.  Chad, how are you doing?  How are you doing, guys?  Hey, Chad, how are you, brother?  How are you doing, man?  Cutty from The Wire.  Let's keep ready.  And, of course, Marlo from The Wire.  But Jamie Hector and Chad Coleman.  Where's Bodie?  Bodie should be on his way.  Oh, he's on his way.  Okay.  Where are we?  Yeah.  I probably got caught up watching that game last night.  Hold on.  I got to figure out what mic you're on. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  Does that one work for you, Marlo?  Marlo.  Jamie?  Yes.  Yeah, that works for you.  Okay, we good?  All right, we're good.  Now, what were you saying about the game?  I mean, no, J.D.  He probably got caught up watching the game last night.  That's probably why we don't see him right now.  What happened with the game?  Wait, wait, wait.  Miami and...  Please tell me you want Dallas.  You know what?  Oh, God.  No, he don't want Dallas.  Listen, no, no, no.  I'll be riding with you.  You're buying into the LeBron James hype?  That's great.  Yeah, I got to ride with him, brother, because you know everybody's counting on a brother to  count out. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  So I'm saluting my brother.  You're both into the heat winning this thing?  And Dwayne?  I never said that.  Dwayne's my boy.  So I got to ride with you.  You know Dwayne?  I said Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Kiesch who have win championships.  Right.  And Jason Terry.  That's what I'm on.  Well, it's a great series.  Dallas Mavericks.  It's a great series.  It's tied at two now.  Yeah.  It is.  Whoever wins the next game will be in the driver's seat.  Well, I didn't watch last night.  86-83, I think.  What were you doing?  Where were you?  What's going on?  I did a set.  I did a very mediocre set at the Comedy Cellar in the Village. 
[01:46:00]  Well received by some.  Not as well as I had hoped it would go.  And then I wound up going home and I'm masturbating furiously on my computer.  Chad, you asked.  I appreciate your honesty.  I think.  You asked.  I appreciate your honesty.  I think.  Wait, you really want the heat there?  Yeah.  I'm riding with the heat.  Definitely.  Don't you think LeBron just kind of bought into this whole thing and kind of takes away  from it a little bit?  I think he's a magnificent player.  He really does what he's supposed to do on the court.  And at the same time, you know, I mean, I dig Dwayne and Bosh. 
[01:46:30]  And they're putting it together.  They're doing it.  And I think they're going to win several championships.  It's hilarious because the rest of the team just doesn't matter.  No one knows their names.  Come on out like Jordan and Pippen though.  Yeah, I know.  No one knows their names.  They're on the court with the guys, but you barely pay attention to them.  Every once in a while, another guy will score.  And you're like, who is that guy?  Who is he?  It's all about those three.  Do you think it was kind of a dick move when Pippen said that he thinks that LeBron is  better than Jordan?  Was that like a jab at Jordan?  Absolutely.  I'm still trying to figure that one out.  How do you say that?  LeBron hasn't put himself on that level yet.  He could very well, you know, do as well as Jordan did. 
[01:47:00]  Well, I mean, I personally, I think Scottie Pippen probably spent more time with Jordan  than anybody else.  So, and was actually at one point probably the second best player in the NBA.  So, you know, when he speaks, I listen.  You know what I mean?  So, and I believe, I believe when it's all said and done, because if you look at the size  of this guy and his basketball acumen, his abilities on the court, what he's able to 
[01:47:30]  do, left, right, and center, yeah, he could be, he could be, he ain't yet.  We're still waiting, though.  That's true.  Jordan used to light it up.  No, I agree.  And play with the flu, let's not forget.  That's true.  In the playoffs, nobody showed up like Jordan.  There was no excuses for Jordan.  Jordan always showed up, played at a high level, and was incredibly successful.  Six championships.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So, yeah.  I mean, he could get there because he's younger.  You know what I mean? 
[01:48:00]  But I don't think that's, we can move on to other things.  I don't think it was up to Pippen to say that.  That's kind of disrespectful.  Being so close to Jordan all those years.  Why would you do that to Jordan?  Let someone else say that.  But he made a point.  No, I understand what Chad's saying.  He got some resentment, man.  Yes.  Remember the Knicks, when he got that call on, you know, against the Knicks, when Jordan  left the league, that very next year, Scottie was on the way to another championship, and  he got a foul called on him against the Knicks, man.  So, he's still resentful. 
[01:48:30]  So, he's mad.  Do you think he's Jordaned out?  Do you think so?  He's tired of Jordan.  It's like Jordan was the hot chick he was dating for a long time.  Jordan left, and he's sick of hearing about Jordan's tits.  He's like, yeah, she was all right, but I fuck other girls now.  You're right.  You're right.  He won a championship on his own.  Yeah.  That would have been great for him.  Yeah, and it never happened.  Right on.  That was his way of saying, like, I'm not, you know, I'll speak out against Michael.  Michael doesn't, isn't the boss of me.  I think that was probably, he's probably tired of being compared second to Jordan. 
[01:49:00]  You're not the boss of me.  Yeah.  As far as the series goes, it's going to be tough for the Mavs, though.  It's a wonderful series.  It is, but.  It's going to be tough for the Mavs.  You know, the Mavs are tiring out.  Last night, Derek had a cold, and that's probably the reason why he missed most of those shots.  If not for that, then, I mean, he would have been amazing.  Come on, let's do this.  And he still is amazing, but, you know, I'm still in all Miami, you know.  Is Miami that much better?  They're supposed to win this.  Yeah, that's a good question. 
[01:49:30]  I don't really know how to answer that.  They got the big three.  They haven't played together that long, obviously.  You know, I don't watch basketball.  After my good friend left, I just kind of stopped.  I'm just showing him my picture of me and Kareem, where his tie is actually longer than my torso.  But I used to love the Lakers, and a lot of people have said, Matt, we brought this up before.  People have speculated that Magic was better than Jordan as an all-around player, not as a scorer,  because he played better defense, and he could play any position on the court, 
[01:50:00]  and he was the center that year.  I don't know if that's true or not.  Jordan was better at motivating.  I mean, Magic was better at motivating the players around him to play at a higher level.  Jordan scared everybody.  You know, Scotty had headaches at first, so he had to get it together, you know,  because Jordan is the type of dude, you know, he ain't taking no shorts, as they say,  and he's not trying to make you feel comfortable.  Magic was all about making the dudes around him feel comfortable, you know? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Magic was more of, like, the caretaker in the family.  They're like, is everybody okay?  Here, I'll pass it to you.  Just pass it back, and I'll put it back.  Let's not forget, Jordan scored 63 points in a playoff game.  Yes, he did.  That was good.  Awesome.  And it was a loss.  Yeah.  LeBron lost last night.  He had eight points.  Did he have eight points?  Yes.  What happened?  He had eight points.  You said he wasn't.  He wasn't.  He had a bad fucking game last night.  Shut him down.  That's rare.  That's only good if you have 75 assists. 
[01:51:00]  Eight points, 48 rebounds, and 75 assists.  That's one, though.  I think it was eight.  He had a bad game last night.  Wow, yeah.  But obviously, we're big fans.  Chad, we haven't talked to you yet.  We've talked to Jamie before.  We're all huge Wire fans.  You were Cuddy on the show.  Indeed.  Doing the boxing thing.  Cutty from the cut.  We had Sugar Ray Leonard in here yesterday.  Is that right?  Yeah.  He was very nice.  We had him crying.  What did Sugar Ray say?  And Sugar Ray said.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:51:30]  That's good.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know what's wrong with Wiener.  That's exactly.  Goddamn, that's a good Sugar Ray.  Sugar Ray's on tape delay.  Yeah.  I'm just kidding.  Sugar Ray.  Love you, bro.  That's funny, man.  It's all about jokes on this show.  Don't you have to say you're kidding.  Absolutely, man.  That's great.  The Wiener reference, though.  We're obsessed with him.  God, we are.  Isn't he the greatest?  What a Wiener.  Another dope that tripped on his own dick on his way to the White House. 
[01:52:00]  He's got a spit zone speed dial right now.  Yeah.  What do I do?  What do I do?  Yeah, who's your PR people?  Because they really made you.  He's got a fucking television show out of it.  That's not a bad game.  Exactly.  Wiener will be on TV.  He's got that personality.  He's going to be so.  He'll get a TV show.  He's so done, though, man.  He's done, yeah.  He's done.  I don't think he's completely done.  I think the Democrats just as a whole are going to say, look, you've got to go.  Regardless if you want to stay or not, you've got to go.  Everybody's going to target you.  The good of the collective.  I guess Jamie hasn't seen the transcripts that came out today. 
[01:52:30]  He's done.  He's done.  He's talking about mouth-fucking.  Jeez.  I'll go my way here.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a dirty boy, this Anthony Wiener.  There's some dirty stuff that came out today that you can only talk about on satellite, by  the way.  They're not going to mention this on CNN.  We're all filthy.  I understand.  But it's that whole, you know, he was lying thing.  People don't like that shit.  Right, right, right.  Out of eye contact also.  Yeah, yeah.  And the Republicans now can just jump down his throat and be like, you know, hey, this guy 
[01:53:00]  lied.  Get him the fuck out.  And there's a montage of him lying, too.  They showed a montage of him going, not me.  I wouldn't do it.  It's like, you kind of have to the first time lie.  Like, he's almost, if he admits it immediately, he's a psychopath who you don't, you know,  did you sleep, you're married, did you sleep with somebody else?  Yes, I did.  That's not a guy that you want to trust because you're a fucking wacko.  But after the first lie, you had to come clean.  And he just, that was really screwed up.  Yeah, if he would have came clean immediately, it probably would have helped him out a little  more.  Yeah, yeah.  He tried to get some mileage.  He started crying.  You know, they all started crying. 
[01:53:30]  Just cry.  My wife, when he brings up his wife, he's like, I don't know.  Crackles.  His voice starts crackling.  My wife and her long head are overseas right now.  You know what?  There's all these political wives that are lousy in bed.  Let's cut to the chase.  I mean, McGreevy's wife you can't blame.  No.  But I think a lot of it is these are very proper women.  These are very, they're well-educated women.  They probably had good upbringings.  Well, it's a different kind of, it's the flip on the trophy wife for them.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Who I need to represent me in public. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  Let me look good.  Yes.  You know, all of that is going on.  Yeah, yeah.  You go like, wow.  Because the best lays are never the ones you want to bring to the White House Correspondents  dinner.  Like the girl who like jams two fingers in your ass.  You never want to be photographed with the president with that woman.  Because she's a wacko.  But that's the way it is.  I love you, Jimmy.  But the truth, though.  You know what I mean?  Oh, I don't like two fingers.  Random example.  I'm a one finger and then run out the door guy. 
[01:54:30]  You're the one finger key.  Yeah.  By the second finger, I'm like, all right, all right, all right.  I got a point.  This isn't funny.  Come on in a wig, ladies and gentlemen.  Bitch, I'm awake now.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little early, but Jimmy knows how to wake you up.  That's great.  Holy shit.  But that is the way it is.  It's like.  Holy shit is right.  There's no combination of that girl.  On this level of power, you have to.  You need something dirty.  That's why they just do this.  Yeah.  I love talking dirty. 
[01:55:00]  I love it, but I'm not a politician, so it's not going to hurt me.  No, you can say whatever you want.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Oof.  I remember the last time you guys came in, I had yet to even watch The Wire.  Oh, wow.  I was sitting there.  He was the odd man out.  And listening to these guys talk about it was like, holy shit, you got to watch it.  I finally was like, all right, I'm popping in season one.  I pop it in.  I'm like, fuck, for a week straight, it was run home, just watch like episode after episode. 
[01:55:30]  And then I'm thinking, who are these poor motherfuckers that had to wait?  Like, when an episode would end, I'm like, no, remote, next one, next one.  You got the fix.  Fuck the week, then wait a year for the next season.  So I was like, beginning to end, watch the whole thing, and now I'm in these guys' camp.  It's the best show I've ever seen on television.  Thank you.  And just spectacularly acting, the storylines, just amazing.  The language. 
[01:56:00]  Amazing.  Yeah.  The realism was there.  It was just, it was fantastic, you know.  And I wasn't able to say that last time.  I'm just like, hey, what are these motherfuckers?  I didn't know.  Listen, that's the beauty of it, man.  The shelf life of this show is crazy.  Yes.  Because you always get new fans all the time.  Right.  And people are having an amazing experience with DVD and being able to control it.  Yeah.  That's right.  They don't have to wait.  The marathon is the shit, man.  There you go.  When you can just one F to another, and then you're like, you wake up and go, ah, fuck, 
[01:56:30]  I missed half of that episode.  I'll catch it tomorrow.  Absolutely.  You know.  And that's why HBO caught so much attention when they basically allowed you to watch the  next episode at midnight.  Right.  Right.  Oh, right.  That right there turned the game up for them.  That's right.  And that made you go to that part of the service, the HBO.  Was it on demand or whatever?  On demand, right.  It was a brilliant move.  That was a brilliant move.  Yeah, it was.  And then how great of an actor is Jamie?  I know.  That's Marlowe.  I can't believe you're the same guy, man.  Because that was just a ruthless-ass character.  I remember the first time you were coming in here.  We were a little scared.  Like, Marlowe's coming in here, man. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Sociopathic kind of guy.  I mean, absolutely.  It's just fantastic, though.  And Jimmy had brought up the scene before I had seen it.  But that poor dumbass security guy at the store.  Oh.  Oh, you dumbass.  Just shut the fuck up.  That's all you got to do.  You know, it's funny, because when I was doing that scene, right before we shot that scene,  Ed Byrne said, this is when America will hate you.  Yes.  That's what he said.  It's like, because he's a working guy.  He's got to do his job. 
[01:57:30]  You know what, though?  I watched that again, and I'm like, stay in the fucking store.  It's a lollipop.  Exactly.  Stay in your lane, man.  That's the point.  That's right.  It's a lollipop.  But he felt he couldn't be punked out like that.  But he didn't know, you know, who he was dealing with.  Yeah.  He should have brought you more lollipops.  That would have been the...  But then again, he didn't know you just dropped 150K or whatever it was.  It was taken by Omar, yeah, yeah.  Oh, was that right after Omar Rodriguez?  Yeah, that was...  I mean, it was basically...  No, I think that was after you lost a poker game, and you said, one day I'm going to come  back, and I'm going to get the escalator. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  See, look at the...  Oh, yeah.  You're correcting Jamie?  Jimmy will fucking give you transcripts.  Did you just correct Jimmy?  Why?  I know when he lost the money.  Jimmy will describe the blocking for the scene.  Although I did make a mistake when we had Michael Williams in the first time, I thought something  happened in season one that actually happened in season two, and so I made a complete asshole  out of myself.  I'm like, I think that was season two, and they're like, that's the guy.  I'm like, oh, yeah, right.  It was season two.  He started whistling.  Whenever I hear him whistle, I always think the farmer in the down. 
[01:58:30]  The farmer in the down.  What is the song that he's whistling?  It is, I think.  That's it.  Oh, it is that.  Oh, I thought it was another song that had the same...  That's definitely it.  That's what's funny about it, right?  So now, we got paintball coming up Saturday.  Now, this sounds great.  I used to play years ago before the equipment got, like, crazy.  Are you guys experienced in paintball?  Dude, I spent four years in the military. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, shit.  And in 08, remember when the strike happened?  I went back, and that was part of the training.  Oh, shit.  And I'm telling you, man, now, we, right, we can say whatever we want, right?  Yeah.  They waxed our ass, man.  I'm telling you right now.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That was some super paintball stuff.  I mean, we had dudes in there, like, scream.  I'm not kidding, man.  All right, I'm hearing about it.  We told you.  I mean, they just basically set us up.  But is it like that, Jack? 
[01:59:30]  No, yeah.  Because, you know what, last year, Def Jam actually purchased a team, not knowing that  they sent, basically, Marines in Team 6.  Wow.  Team 6.  Look, they hit me.  I mean, I never felt anything like it before, but at the same time, it felt good, you know?  But they hit me so quick in the way that they moved an organization, and they came down  the line.  They cut us off, and they just, rah!  They had me screaming, like, oh, you know, I didn't hit back.  That's why I didn't win last year.  You can't even get a shot off.  You're just done.  If you get shot once, you're done. 
[02:00:00]  Is that how it works?  Well, no.  If you get...  No, they have the rules up there.  But if you get shot once, yeah, if you get shot once, you're actually eliminated.  All right, because I'm going to bring different...  I'm just going to bring outfits and start shedding clothes.  That's not me.  But there's so much protective gear out there and so many things to guard yourself behind  that you can't get shot if you know how to move and maneuver, and your partner  can protect you also.  Unless you get, like, somebody...  Because once they whittle your team down enough, and you could be behind something and just 
[02:00:30]  going, it's just a matter of time.  I'm going to get up and do an Audie Murphy run to the...  The second you stand up, you're just done.  I just don't want to get shot by Chad, because he's going to humiliate me.  Like, you let fruit go, and then I'm going to...  And then he's going to have me in his sights, and he's going to fucking pot me.  Screw you, Jimmy.  That's what I'm saying.  I have to go to Jamie.  Couldn't do it, man.  Couldn't do it.  Why?  I don't know.  The little worm was sitting there asking me to sign a DVD. 
[02:01:00]  Couldn't do it to him.  Couldn't do it, man.  Did you come in season three or four?  Three.  Jamie and I came in the same season.  I thought so.  Okay.  Absolutely, man.  I thought so.  So let me give you that details, too, while we keep talking here.  Just so you know, individuals can come, and we've been saying that people think they have  to bring five people.  If it's just you and one buddy or whatever, you can come by yourself, and they'll put you  on a team.  It's at New York City Paintball, 4711 Van Damme Street.  It's right over the 59th Street Bridge in Queens.  Very easy to get to. 
[02:01:30]  Or you could call...  What's his name, the guy we're calling?  Robert Vesquist.  Oh, Robert, okay.  Call him at 201-852-8777.  That's 201-852-8777.  Or you could email him.  It's ROBKRS10.  Very easy one to remember.  Jesus.  ROBKRS10 at me.com.  And the packages range from $750 to $2,500 per team. 
[02:02:00]  So you won't have to pay that much as an individual.  There are meet and greets in some of the packages.  And all the proceeds, every dollar, goes to Moving Mountains Incorporated.  This is Jamie's non-profit youth organization.  It allows kids to develop their talents as actors.  And, you know, it's a great cause.  And, you know, I certainly could have used something like this when I was young.  You know, just because my acting stinks.  I wish somebody was looking out for me, because now I'm 42.  And I audition.  And they're like, hey, we like your comedy.  And I come in, I'm like...  And they're like, you're fucking horrendous. 
[02:02:30]  What's the charity about?  Well, it's a wonderful organization.  It's basically caters to at-risk youth in Brooklyn.  But the wonderful part about it, we have kids that we service from Harlem, New Jersey, Queens.  And they basically all come into Brooklyn.  And we focus on acting, music.  We have a studio designed for them also.  They can develop and create their own music.  And we have a show every month at the Brooklyn Museum, because they extended their space to us.  So we develop original plays.  And then we go and perform the original plays.  And we raise funding through that also. 
[02:03:00]  As well as dancing.  And at the dance studio down on Fulton in Brooklyn also, we extend space to them.  They extend space to us over there.  And it's just an all-inclusive location where kids can actually come and create.  And it's free of charge.  That's cool.  Did you get involved with somebody else or think this up yourself?  I mean, that's pretty noble.  I was a part of a theater company when I was growing up called Tomorrow's Future Theater Company.  That effectively changed my life.  And basically from that point on, I went and studied at Strasburg, because that was the springboard for me. 
[02:03:30]  Like, I got the acting bug from there.  And then I partnered up with Elaine Roberson and S.A. Overmeyer, and we all came together.  And I just, you know what it was really also?  I was shooting The Wire season three.  Beginning of season four, we had that break.  Like you guys said, the year in between.  And I was walking, and there's a kid that I used to work with in the past.  And he just looked at me and said, Jamie, are you coming back for me?  And I said, wow.  I was like, yeah, we'll be back.  So then from that point on, we went over, we took care of the paperwork, the 501c3 nonprofit, found a location. 
[02:04:00]  Meg Evers College partnered up with us, and they basically extended space to us.  They gave us a location.  So now we're in the process of trying to purchase the building in Brooklyn.  God, I can't even get out of bed.  He's a good guy.  He's working and setting up charities and stuff.  And I'm just like, ah, tomorrow.  You know what?  I felt good about myself because I donated all my baby stuff to a charity yesterday. 
[02:04:30]  I feel like I'm the shit today.  And look what this guy's doing.  But you know what, man?  It's just a powerful testament that arts empower.  The arts change.  As soon as they start cutting something, they want to cut the arts.  But you realize that it's an empowering thing because the most important thing for these kids is to find out their identity and their self-worth.  And when you start creating, something happens inside you that changes the whole, because everybody's really looking at you from the outside and telling you who you are. 
[02:05:00]  And then when you get to start to define yourself, something happens inside you that happened to Jamie.  And he carried forward, and he paid it forward.  Can we cancel history and get rid of history teachers before?  Seriously.  It's always the arts.  You're absolutely right.  Trigonometry?  I've never been with a hooker and said, look, I owe you $50.  I only have two with X to the third power. 
[02:05:30]  But when it comes to theater or music, it's like, yeah, get rid of that.  Who really needs that shit?  And that is the real stuff that can make a difference, where people kind of can go in there, realize who they are, bring out talents they never thought they had.  That along with academics, of course.  Yeah, no doubt.  But that, to not take that away, to not strip that away is key.  And when they have a place to actually come and develop their talents, because there's so many budding talents out there.  When they have a place to come and develop it and grow. 
[02:06:00]  You know what's great, too, though?  It's not like you're going to the government and asking for all kinds of money or trying to get tax money.  You're raising money, and obviously it's good being who you are.  You're recognizable.  And doing stuff like that.  Like I said, I don't get out of bed, and that's a pretty fucking noble thing to do.  You know, I have to say, a lot of red tape with the government, but with the support of my team.  I don't know, yeah.  Chad, Sonya, Michael K. Williams, JD, Snoop, Anwan, Slim Charles, Anwan Glover. 
[02:06:30]  With the whole team, I mean, they support, and we always support each other.  Sonya, where we ride for change, and her organization.  Why do you think that show and the cast, you guys have stayed pretty tight when some shows, they finish up and they never see each other again?  We're in Hollywood, man.  We're very real people.  Yeah.  It was a very real show that demanded very real actors.  You know, so I think for the most part, you know, the quality of that show demanded people who were really about, you know, truth, honesty. 
[02:07:00]  You know, and we're anti-Hollywood, and we were anti-Hollywood.  You know what I'm saying?  And apparently Hollywood was anti-Wire.  That's what I'm talking about.  Not to say we ain't Hollywood.  You know, we're doing our thing, but at the same time, man, like, and Ed Burns will always say, it's like, man, guys, like you and Jamie, you rare.  You rare.  You really do care.  You really do care.  And, you know, I don't know, man.  It's a product of our upbringing, a product of our faith. 
[02:07:30]  You know, it's all the above.  What did you do, Chad, before you acted?  I was a security guard.  Oh, really?  He was a forever actor.  This guy was, I mean, I was a soldier.  I was a soldier.  What branch?  The U.S. Army.  I spent four years in the military as a video cameraman and got to travel all over the world.  Came out, went to New York, doing my thing.  But, you know, I had 15 different jobs trying to make this thing happen.  I think that's the other thing.  A lot of people, if you don't struggle, you know, if you ain't been through nothing, then, you know, it's a little bit surface. 
[02:08:00]  You know, I can't even, I couldn't afford to be surface, man.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a hustle.  It was a grind.  You know what I mean?  So when you get a level of success, you know, you don't forget where you came from.  I mean, I really can't forget it.  That's the, yeah, yeah.  It's like, I love that when people tell me that shit all the time.  They're like, hey, Anthony forgot where he came from.  He's swimming in his pool.  It's like, I lived in my car, motherfucker.  You know?  Believe me.  And I remember it.  I can't look at Wheat Thins anymore because I lived on them for like a month straight. 
[02:08:30]  Just popping these dry-ass Wheat Thins in my drinking water.  And it's like, I forgot where I came from.  Really?  Exactly.  Really?  I can't forget.  Wheat Thins makes me remember.  One time I was having people over and my butler forgot the cheese with the Wheat Thins.  I understand.  Damn it.  Damn it.  You deep, dude.  Oh, man.  It's been a hustle.  You know what?  That's keeping it real and being, you know, where you came from. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, I don't want to one-up everybody, but, you know, please.  All of my guests were mortified.  You are an ass.  Please shoot him a lot Saturday.  Yeah, that's my biggest thing is who do I want to be killed?  Believe me, because I'm going to last about four minutes.  There's really nobody I don't want to be shot.  Any one of these guys, I would be honored.  Or Snoop, or Slip Charles, or any of them.  I would be really happy.  Is Dom playing?  You know what?  Dom is supposed to come down.  Yeah.  Okay, Dom Lombardozzi.  You are going to get welts on that fucking thin, pale-ass skin of yours. 
[02:09:30]  I'm just happy you said thin.  It's great.  No, I bet your skin.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It really is translucent.  It's fucking pale saran wrap.  I look forward to the welts on Monday.  I don't mind a good welt.  Put them in some good places, boys.  I'm going to wear baggy clothes.  You have to wear baggy clothes or better because it absorbs impact.  Right.  Normally, I would wear tight things to show off my body.  Spandex.  White spandex.  With a bag of benedictine.  I don't recommend it for paintball spandex, no. 
[02:10:00]  I wear like a white spandex wrestling onesie.  That's how I go out.  Take a Cialis, go play a little paintball.  Protect the nipples, bro.  Protect the nipples now.  Yeah, that's my sensitive spot.  Do you know how any massage therapists have been creeped out when they're like just doing  the normal chest rub and they brush my nipple and I go like, oh, no.  Jesus, man.  Oh, my God.  That fucking, they're so annoyed when I sexualize the massage and they're not interested in that.  So, you guys, is Glenn Close here or no? 
[02:10:30]  I hear she, you guys know Glenn Close.  Oh, man.  She's running late.  Oh, good, good, good.  After all that, she's running late.  Good, because I have no idea.  The Glenn Close thing has been very complicated.  She would have to come in for these guys.  I like coming up soon.  I'll tell you guys the truth.  We wanted to blow off Glenn Close so we could spend more time with you guys.  That's what we think of the wire and you guys.  We're like, fuck Glenn Close.  She's going to come in here and say, I will not be ignored, Anthony.  Is that the greatest I hate women's statement?  I will not be ignored, Dan. 
[02:11:00]  And you're like, we've all fucked girls like you.  She's coming up now.  It was too late, right?  It was too late.  We've all met girls like you.  Well, I think maybe she could come in and hang with us and then, you know, we'll hang until like 9 o'clock  and then we have Andrew Breitbart coming in or Breitbart, whatever you say his name, right?  Breitbart.  So she'll come in and just do a few minutes.  I was hanging out drinking with that guy the other night.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he's the guy that's got the pictures of Wiener.  Oh, exactly.  All the transcripts and broke the story. 
[02:11:30]  There you go.  Went up for the press conference.  He might have a peck.  And all I know.  He said he demanded an apology.  Yeah, yeah.  Did he get it?  He got it.  He got it.  Wiener would have apologized to anybody who asked that.  At that point, yeah.  He would have apologized to anybody.  He would have apologized for the serial killer lie in season five at the end if you would have asked him to.  Hey, did you tie that ribbon around?  I'm sorry.  I tied the ribbon.  I'm sorry.  Oh, he was in apology mode.  Hey, before Glenn Close gets here, how's Snoop doing?  Snoop is doing okay. 
[02:12:00]  With her legal issues.  She's all right?  Yeah, we spoke to her.  She's going through.  Yeah, everything is turning out well.  I've got a lot of questions on her coming in.  So she's going to be at the paintball?  She's going to be at the paintball.  She's playing.  I haven't met her.  She was in one time doing, I think, Shade next door.  Yeah, yeah.  And Louis C.K. was here.  She don't play.  And she went nuts when she saw Louis, apparently.  She don't play, man.  We were intimidated with her, too.  Yeah, she's so hilarious.  I mean, you get a chance to sit down with her up here.  Yeah.  You guys will fall off your seat.  I would love to talk to her.  Oh, yeah.  We talked to her.  We talked to her.  Yeah, Jimmy just wasn't here that day.  But, wow, she's intimidating. 
[02:12:30]  She was a little Larry King one time.  Yeah.  But she's got a lot.  Yo, you better watch out, bro.  She mad.  She mad right now.  Is she?  With all she got to deal with.  Please, man.  I would love to interview her.  I think she's great.  I'm trying to tell you now.  But watch out tomorrow.  Oh, she's shooting the paintball.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She takes a little ticket.  I probably look like the cop that raided the place.  Little fat-faced idiot.  She's like, oh, this guy is finished.  Are there going to be metal detectors there?  I mean, they... 
[02:13:00]  You guys are using paintball guns, right?  I know.  I know.  We're all thinking Brandon Lee.  Is sure Snoop's not going to get confused?  She's going to...  Not at all.  Not at all.  Not even her character.  She was actually...  It wasn't even true, thank God.  You know, based on everything that she told me.  That's great.  And she told everyone else.  So, it's going to be...  The truth is going to come out at the end.  And we can have Glenn just come in and sit at the end, right?  We can do that with her.  All right.  I don't want you guys to leave.  You don't mind if she comes in and hangs with us.  Let her go.  I'm going to love her clothes.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  I met her one time.  She was very nice.  And she actually looked good. 
[02:13:30]  That's what I'm saying.  She's gorgeous.  Yeah.  In person, she's pretty...  Yeah, she is.  Come on now.  Remember, Jay?  We met her at Travica when we went down for the film festival?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Who was that?  Was that Travica film festival?  Travica, dude.  Yeah.  Have you met Obama yet?  He's a...  It's his favorite program.  Why say program like I'm my fucking aunt?  His favorite show.  Favorite show.  And the attorney general actually said they want it back.  That's right.  They love...  Isn't that something?  The Wire.  Wow.  He came to see me.  I was on Broadway, and Joe Turner's come and gone a couple years ago.  He came to see the show.  Remember that?  That was Date Night for... 
[02:14:00]  Oh, Date Night.  Yeah.  The Broadway Date Night.  Oh, you were in that show?  He came to see you?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That is cool.  That's as close as I got, man.  You didn't get to meet him?  He was gone?  Nah, because it was a small theater.  Only one exit.  They didn't want to wait.  Sure, sure, sure.  It was that type of deal.  That's pretty cool.  Were you nervous?  Nah, man.  You know, like I said, when it's your moment, it's your moment, man.  If you get a chance to perform for the president, it's what you do.  Do your thing.  That's how I felt.  He doesn't turn his phone off.  You got to yell at him.  Yeah.  What is this, man?  The phone's ringing.  Hey, I tell you what, man. 
[02:14:30]  It can't be that important.  People kept applauding.  They would not stop.  It's like, listen, we got to start the show, okay?  You know you love him.  We love him, too.  But can we do the play?  I got a play to put on.  Enough already.  And this is where we're different.  I'm so selfish.  What was the name of your character in the play?  I was Harold Loomis.  I would have stayed as Harold, and somehow I would have walked off the stage as Harold,  and somehow gotten the other character to photograph me in the president.  I would have weaseled it into the script.  Made it somehow part of the play.  He is crazy when it comes to his pictures. 
[02:15:00]  It's amazing how I would have had to.  Let's do your lines in the audience.  That's what I met you at.  I met you at a premiere, right?  Yes, it was for Bored to Death.  I did an episode of Bored, and I was sitting there, I watched, they showed a couple of  episodes, and somebody said, because I had wanted to meet Jamie for so long, he was impossible  to get on the show when season five came out, and somebody goes, I was talking to Jonathan  Ames, and he goes, yeah, it was a great show.  And he goes, yeah, and one of the guys from The Wire was there.  I'm like, who?  And he goes, who?  The guy played Marlo? 
[02:15:30]  I'm like, fucking Jamie Hector?  And I ran outside.  I almost tackled him.  I'm like, hi.  And he's like, hi, you want to the after party?  I'm like, can we have a picture?  And that's why in our picture together, Jamie, he looks like a politician running for office.  He's just kind of shaking my hand.  And I'm such a jizz bag.  I almost went home.  Thank God I didn't humiliate myself like this.  I almost went home and got my season five and went to the after party, but I didn't do  that.  I'm like, all right.  Oh, that would have been horrible.  I didn't do it.  Remember, we just took a picture. 
[02:16:00]  Could you sign me?  Yeah, I happen to have season five in my pocket.  LOL.  But that was a great place I didn't expect to meet.  We had Wendell Pearson and Clark Peterson recently.  Everyone's been on the show.  Yeah, we had Lance Reddick over at K-Rock when the French came out.  Who haven't we had?  It's still on, isn't it?  Who haven't we had?  We've had just about all of them.  We haven't had Bodhi. 
[02:16:30]  We haven't had J.D. Williams.  You know what?  That's what I was looking for.  Yeah, maybe he's overslept or whatever.  He's not here.  Who's outside for us?  Glenn's not here yet?  Is she coming up?  Okay, once she comes up, we'll just walk her right in.  You guys can stay for a few minutes.  After all that, she's late.  Tell her to...  Tell her to...  You have no idea, guys.  Take her.  We've been through with this Glenn Close thing.  Yeah, believe me, the wire took precedent over every other guest.  Believe me, we're going to clear the table.  You want to take a quick break?  I know it.  She's not here yet.  Eh.  Do we need to?  I mean... 
[02:17:00]  No matter to me.  I don't care.  I just wanted to ask...  I know, obviously, you know, the show's been off for a while, but like I said, I just  watched the goddamn thing.  There's got to be a lot of speculation as to what happens to your character after that.  You're just on the corner.  Obviously, you can't deal with that corporate bullshit.  But how long would you speculate that character lived after the show ends if you had, you  know, hypothetically taken it longer?  You know, it's funny because you can basically see what happened to the characters that came 
[02:17:30]  before him and just basically assume what's going to happen to that character.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  His team is gone.  Mm-hmm.  He has the money, but he just needs that power.  He needs that street.  And the young guy's going to come up.  And, you know, I don't want to basically write the story for anybody that's going to probably  write it afterwards, but I would assume that he would probably get fizzled out.  Probably, right?  Probably, because he can't leave the streets.  He can't...  I mean, they gave him everything in a handbasket.  Yeah, it was almost like a, all right, here he is.  He's moving and shaking with the business end of this. 
[02:18:00]  But that's not his...  That's way out of his league.  It's not his scene.  He goes down, and that's all gone, too.  Because they don't remember him.  And you almost...  It's so fucked up how it's such a ruthless guy, but you almost feel bad for the character.  You're like, he's so out of it now.  He's just, you know, passe.  After he gets...  He works so hard for that crown.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the biggest part that bugged him is that Omar was calling him out by name.  That was the only time I think he yelled in the entire series.  He yelled once.  He yelled once, and it was crisp. 
[02:18:30]  But it was a very powerful...  It was like Lance Reddick.  I mean, he played Daniels, for anybody listening who doesn't know.  He yelled maybe once or twice in five seasons about what's my fucking rank.  There wasn't enough gym equipment around for him to...  That's funny, because somebody else was saying that when that happened, you know, it was like,  you knew it was there.  Yeah.  It was like, you can see it in his eyes.  Oh, but he just, you know, he stayed on top of it.  You know, so it's like, okay, that's what got him... 
[02:19:00]  Right, when you see...  You're like, oh, there's the murderer.  Right.  There's the murderer.  Because I figured that the guy who was willing to pull the trigger was there, and that's  the guy.  But then again, the prop Joe, we've talked about this before.  Oh, yeah.  That was a really sad one, and to me, that was one of the...  That was as compassionate as he could be.  Like, he liked Joe.  He didn't want to have to kill him, but it had to be done.  So close your eyes.  We'll shoot you in the back of the head.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Yeah, it'll be able to go fast.  It'll be fast. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, I think, you know, he associated everything, basically, to him was business.  Right, right.  He was business and power.  You know, and it's like, I guess, corporate America, and especially in the prison scene  where he actually lost his cool, I think it's something where, look, if this was...  I think we spoke about this before, also.  If this was Goldman Sachs, I need to know everything that's going on.  Yeah, yeah.  I need to know what's going on, if it's going to affect me drastically.  Yeah, business-wise.  And if it's going to affect me not as drastically, I still need to know what's going on.  But if you don't tell me and I don't know, then it's going to affect...  That's what Warren Buffett said to Homeboy. 
[02:20:00]  I need to know what's going on, man.  You make 50 cents in the box.  You're doing some inside training over here.  I need to know what's happening, man.  Yeah, you know what?  That conversation has probably happened in other boardrooms.  It's just not...  It's just not my name is...  But, you know, my name's on the street.  So, like, he was bad-mouthing me in the boardroom, and I didn't know it.  Well, yeah.  It had to come back.  It's probably the same discussion.  The show did a great job of equating the street-level drug dealing and that whole hierarchy to the political and police department corruption, backroom deals, which was no better than what was going on in the street. 
[02:20:30]  It was just a, you know, legitimate, legal sort of, you know, skirt and the rules.  Yeah, yeah.  And I think that's what made the show so great also, because it showed both sides honestly like that.  But there was no agenda to that show either.  I never watched it feeling like I was being preached to on one side or another. 
[02:21:00]  It was just, hey, this is how it is.  Take it like you will, you know, which is great.  Such just complete...  I call it watchability.  It's just you...  And I know, like I said, it ended a while ago, but that show is one of those that is just going to go on.  You guys are going to be cursed with people constantly coming up.  Because, I mean, during the first run...  It's better than Jimmy Walker, you know?  I don't want to...  You're not screaming dynamite everywhere you go. 
[02:21:30]  I'll take Cuddy for the rest of my life.  Believe me, it is a great thing.  And I didn't mean it like a typecasting thing or anything like that.  I meant like the first run of The Wire when it was being run on HBO.  Yeah.  I don't know how many people watched it or what have you, but so many people are just now getting to watch it.  That's right.  And believe me, years from now, they're still going to be fucking putting in whatever the hell it is, a chip in their head.  And, you know...  Hey, I'm watching The Wire right now! 
[02:22:00]  Dude, I was on Amtrak yesterday, and it's just one of them surreal moments.  I walked past this dude, and he's watching The Wire on his laptop, right?  I'm looking at Bunny Colvin on the screen, so I know it's season three, you know what I mean?  So I walked back, and I just stopped, and I go...  And then I kept walking.  Oh, man.  He said, you...  Yeah, wait a minute.  What the fuck?  But he said the same thing.  It's part of what you're saying.  No good guy, no bad guy. 
[02:22:30]  Everybody's a bit of both.  It's just what it is.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't paint the...  And you can't...  The thing is, you're like, wow, that guy is ruthless, but you can't fault him for being like that.  Right.  There's Glenn Close.  Hi, Glenn.  Look at this.  Look, let's give a round of applause right now.  Yes, yes, of course.  Hi, Glenn.  Hollywood royalty.  Yes, indeed.  We're kind of backed up here.  I apologize, but...  These are the guys from The Wire.  This is surreal right here, y'all.  Marlo is right next to Glenn Close. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  That's a little surreal.  I don't know which one is icier, okay?  You guys, you know, call in.  Oh, man.  You decide.  How are you?  I'm really well, thanks.  You and I met years ago.  I'm sure you don't remember.  It was backstage at Dane Cook's show in Boston.  Oh, yeah.  I remember the show.  I remember meeting you.  Oh, no.  She's a great actress.  That's a great actress.  That is a great actress.  Do you see the real is in there? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  I remind her of the rabbit she killed.  Never going to live that rabbit down.  No, no, no.  I don't think I will.  We were just talking to these guys, too, about being...  You know, The Wire is that show that nobody can ever forget.  Do you find that most people associate you with that?  Is it kind of frustrating to have that one role be so prominent in your kind of identity?  No, actually.  I'm actually pretty proud of it.  I think it's an amazing achievement to have been part of something that actually has become part of our culture.  Absolutely.  And I think The Wire is exactly the same kind of show. 
[02:24:00]  Wow.  You were nominated for Fatal Attraction.  Yes.  And who won that year?  Cher.  For what?  Was it Silkwood?  Moonstruck?  Moonstruck.  Moonstruck.  Oh, that sucked.  We all know that.  When somebody beats you like that, I know on some level you know, like, hey, it's another good performer,  but is it really annoying on some level?  You're like, look, I saw that.  It was like, if you're losing the De Niro for Raging Bull, but when you're losing the Moonstruck,  are you kind of like, eh?  We'll see how she answers this. 
[02:24:30]  I don't know.  I was actually having a great time.  I was almost, I was like eight months pregnant.  I don't know if you remember that.  And Michael Douglas and I came out and gave an award together, and I came out hugely pregnant,  and everybody just laughed, because in the movie, I say that I'm carrying his child.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  It was like proof.  I was telling the truth.  That's amazing.  What is your show now?  Damages.  And that's, it's about an attorney?  Yes.  Yes.  I knew that.  I had to ask this for the audience.  There are a lot more than that. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just about an attorney.  It's correct.  You know how the court goes home.  Guys, you know this.  We were working still at 12 o'clock last night, so I'm looking a little worse for wear.  Wow.  That would be funny.  It was just about a lawyer, but it didn't cover court at all, just about the lawyer  and the car problem she has.  Let's ask one quick question.  Can I ask one quick question?  Sure.  Certainly.  When you were doing Fatal Attraction, did you guys get to improvise at all, or was it  all scripted and set?  It was pretty scripted. 
[02:25:30]  Okay.  It was pretty scripted.  We worked a lot, collaborated a lot on the script before we started.  Okay.  I did a lot of research about that character.  Absolutely.  And there were sometimes, there were some scenes that still, I mean, the scene where  I say I won't be ignored.  We were just talking about that.  We just broke that line.  We were just talking about that.  That was the hardest scene for me to do, and I couldn't figure out, you know, why.  And, you know, it was the kind of thing where they'd ask the whole cast to go away, and  the crew, you know, take a break, and you kind of were there figuring it out. 
[02:26:00]  We cut a lot of lines.  And then I think what had happened when I think back on it, I was wearing that little  teddy.  I felt so vulnerable, and so uncomfortable, and so upset, you know, and so I was actually  going through, as an actor, what the character was kind of going through, and it, you know,  but it wasn't an easy scene.  That line resonates with people.  Oh, yeah.  It's everybody has hooked up with a person like that, male or female, and it's frightening  how good that was. 
[02:26:30]  I won't be ignored, Dan.  You know, at that moment, Dan is in trouble.  Oh, boy, he's in trouble.  Oh, she's not going away quietly.  Did people have trouble shaking that role from you?  And, because you really did come off like a complete psychopath.  You did a great job.  It's interesting.  I mean, it's one of the reasons why I'm here, you know, is to talk about mental illness.  Yeah.  Because we're having this event at the Mets, the Mets game on the 18th. 
[02:27:00]  But I have gotten letters from people saying that it's, that she is, you know, this kind  of behavior, this kind of behavior.  So, now, I had huge empathy for that character because with my research, you know, I came  up with, with psychiatrists with the, with the, with the fact that somebody behaves like  that if they'd been, for example, incested at a very early age, and she has all those  weird things about her father.  Sure.  So, she had secrets that the audience never knew, and it really kind of affected her behavior 
[02:27:30]  and made me really love her.  So, you really did sit down with professionals and say, okay, what, what type of background  would this person have had to have turned out like this?  Absolutely, because if you, if you're going to boil a bunny, you got to know where that  comes from, I guess.  That's so true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I don't know, Thanksgiving, we boil bunnies.  What kind of research did you, did you do?  Because obviously, you know, to play that kind of a ruthless, cold killer, what kind of research 
[02:28:00]  did you have to go through?  You know, it's funny because I, me personally, I kind of threw everything up against the wall,  but also studied the behavior of other people that I knew, and it was just a lot of writing  down also, and just asking a lot of questions, and there was one specific book that I would  always flip a page on, which is what a lot of people tend to read, Art of War and the  48 Laws of Power.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So, I would always basically pull something from that book because it was coming from a  position of power.  Wow, you know, now that you think about it, yeah. 
[02:28:30]  That's sweet.  Was that the book they were referencing?  Yeah, Marlo really did kind of adhere to a lot of those rules.  He really did.  Even if he didn't know that he was adhering to it, he basically, and he didn't, Marlo didn't  actually research the book.  He didn't go and say, okay, I'm going to move.  Right, right.  He's going to live in life.  And I would basically just try to apply it like that.  And also this, you know, you would find people and you would basically study the way that  they move and the way that they think and how they respond to certain things also.  And I would just study it that way. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Well, amazing job.  When you did your, what is the charity for mental illness?  What exactly, you're involved with that?  It's called Bring Change to Mind.  I started this, co-founded this organization.  My sister's bipolar and my nephew is schizoaffective.  So I've seen, you know, what that kind of illness does to people.  And I've also seen how, what stigma, the terrible stigma that really is really rampant still  in this country about people living with mental illness, just so many misconceived ideas about 
[02:29:30]  it.  And so my, as an actor, I know the power of words and that I've had certain jobs in my  career where there's certain words.  I did way, way back, actually with Ted Danson, a movie about incest and I couldn't even say  it, you know.  And I know that if you, for things like schizophrenia or bipolar or borderline personality, all those  scary things, if we, it's a part of being a human being. 
[02:30:00]  I mean, one out of four people is touched in some way by mental illness.  So it's part of being human.  It doesn't separate you from being human.  I'm misrum.  There's a bunch of people without mental illness walking around because the average  in here is, believe me.  Three for three.  Do you find though, because we've all been affected by it on some level, by knowing somebody  or having hooked up with that one person and the frustration that comes is sometimes, like  as a person who is affected by other people having it, I'm like, there is a piece of it 
[02:30:30]  that is very self-centered by that person.  Not the part that they can't help, but the part that's self-centered.  And I'm always like, that's not addressed enough.  And if people just wind up resenting them for being mentally ill, instead of having empathy  for them, because the self-centered part of it isn't addressed.  So you feel like they're being victimized or they're saying they're being victimized,  but they're not kind of owning up to the part of it that is there.  Taking a little responsibility.  Yes.  It's from both sides.  And one of the reasons I never would have done this without my sister and my nephew,  because they're the ones who are living on a daily basis, if they weren't willing to 
[02:31:00]  out themselves nationally, we have this PSA that we did that Ron Howard directed.  I never would have done it because you can't, you have, you know, the people who are living  with it have to be willing to talk about it.  And that, I mean, that's a huge, it's a huge thing because a lot of people are living with  it secretly, they're afraid to talk about it, you know, sometimes with good reason in  the business, you know, in the workplace.  A lot of people think that you can't be ineffective and have a person and have a full life, but 
[02:31:30]  you can.  I know what Jimmy's talking about, too, because we've talked about the show Hoarders.  You watch Hoarders, and obviously these people have mental problems.  They are mentally ill.  Uh, but you sit there and just grind your teeth going, take her out to lunch and burn  the house down.  Just burn the house down with all the junk in it.  Because they're being very like, okay, well you pick out, now everybody, let's make sure 
[02:32:00]  she's only throwing away things she wants to throw away.  And I'm yelling at the TV, why are you coddling this person?  Like a lunatic.  Uh, that's the frustration that comes into play.  And that's the frustration factor with it.  And I guess, is that part of, of, of, uh, you know, the knowledge that you're trying  to get out there?  Like, hey, you know, maybe they can't help it.  Yes.  I mean, I, I think there are very, there are a lot of levels with this.  Um, and I think there's a lot of ignorance.  We toss around words like lunatic and crazy, you know, very, he does. 
[02:32:30]  I don't like those words.  Those words are hurtful.  That's just from where I grew up.  Yeah.  My house was full of lunatics and crazy people.  Believe me.  We have a history of it in my family too, but you know, it was a big deal.  We had no, we had no language for that.  We had no language for it.  My sister was just the wild girl, the wild child, you know, the difficult one.  Would that be fits of rage?  And like bipolar is, cause I know I've known bipolar.  Is that like, well, you're really good one minute and then just in a rage the next, or  is it day to day?  No, I mean, I mean, again, they're, they're, they're, everyone's different, but it basically 
[02:33:00]  you have, you have highs, you have, you know, kind of manic periods where you, if you're  a creative person, you are really at it.  You're creative.  You're on a high and then you have really serious depression.  And so you kind of go in between the both.  I've wondered too many times, obviously, like I go through my highs and lows like every person,  but I mean, you know, like, all right, I want to hang myself.  And then I'm like, Oh my God, I'm fantastic.  They should just film me.  Like, it's like you kind of go through these periods and it's like, I've, you know, I'm 
[02:33:30]  in therapy.  I mean, you know, just, it's not really, but yeah, but it's like, I wonder about medication.  Like I take Sammy, which is like a, like a, like a, a natural thing.  I'm afraid of medication killing creativity or the, uh, or the sex drive.  Well, that's very, that's very interesting.  Cause my sister, who's a writer, um, she, and this is kind of really hopeful because you  can, there are meds that do work and you can, if you're with a real, a good,  doctor, uh, know how to regulate them.  And there are times when she's going into a low or going into a manicure where they have 
[02:34:00]  to have a little bit of a little tweak, and then, you know, they really believe that you  can't lose your creativity.  It is possible to stay creative, but you have to know, you know, how to, to manipulate the  meds.  And that's very, very possible.  And I'm afraid of being lazy, I guess.  Like, like I, I don't smoke pot or drink.  I know, believe me, I'm a bag of shit with teeth, but I'm afraid of being like, so lazy  where like pot makes you lazy mentally.  Like, uh, they say it's not addictive, but like, I know a lot of creative people that smoke 
[02:34:30]  dope and then they just don't work.  And I'm afraid of that, like that lackadaisical or that haze falling over me.  That's why medication scares me.  Yeah.  I think a medication scares a lot of people.  I think it's the reason why a lot of people don't seek help.  Um, there's also the whole world of guys coming back from, and women coming back from  our two wars who are suffering seriously from PTSD, you know, and, and that, you know, they  need help.  But the culture is don't admit that you have a weakness.  Don't admit.  And, and I think that's where we have to have, you know, a real change in our, in our thinking. 
[02:35:00]  And, um, I just want to be able to mention this game, you know, it's on the 18th of June.  It's the day before father days, the evening game, and we have 500, uh, seats to sell and  you can get on bring change to mind.org and click onto the strikeout stigma with the Mets.  And I've been singing the anthem with the Mets for 20 years.  So I'll be singing the anthem again.  And I'm really excited about it.  Cool.  We should get all the plugs out and stuff, right?  Make sure.  But we have to break. 
[02:35:30]  Is Brie better?  Yeah.  I believe so.  We definitely have to break.  Okay.  And, uh, let's, let's, uh, so that's, uh, uh, Glenn's charity.  And then what's the date again?  June 18th.  June 18th.  Uh, it's at Shea Stadium.  It's at.  Or City Field.  City Field.  Okay.  Do you start the anthem real low?  Oh, who's saying?  Oh, who's saying?  Oh, who's saying?  Very low and very fast.  You have a lot of confidence when you start and then you're like, oh, I think I started  too high.  I did that once.  I know what's coming up.  And then I ran off the field and made a gagging motion and it was up on the field.  Oh, really? 
[02:36:00]  Like, ah, cheese that one.  Damn it.  That's great.  It's a hard song.  It's great to know what happens to Glenn Close, too.  And, uh, we have to thank also, uh, uh, Chad and Jamie, of course, and I want to get  out all the information on this, uh, on this, uh, charity event.  Anthony and I are going to be taking part.  It's the Wire Paintball.  It's this Saturday, 8 a.m. to 11.  It's three hours and there's certain meet and greet, uh, possibilities afterwards.  A lot of cast members are going to be there.  I'll be like, break yourself!  Break yourself!  I love that, right? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, I'm so intimidating.  It's, what?  Um, Andrew Breitbart's here now.  Okay, so yeah, we'll take a quick break.  And we're going to have, um, uh, uh, we're going to, uh, you know, Stoops is going to be  there.  Uh, Omar will be there.  I'm just giving you character names, obviously.  Uh, Cuddy Marlow.  It's going to be an amazing event.  It's New York City Paintball.  Call 201-852-8777.  Anthony and I will be there.  And, uh, I'm babbling at this point.  And, uh, we love you guys.  And thank you for coming.  Thank you, Glenn.  We'll be back in two minutes with, uh, with Andrew, uh, Breitbart. 
[02:37:00]  And then we have Vincent D'Onofrio at 930, whatever.  The Virus Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Busy show.  And, of course, once again, we got to say,  yeah, bring in Andrew.  Glenn Close was great, wasn't she, Jimmy?  Yes, she was there.  There he is.  Andrew.  Andrew, how you been?  Good.  Pleasure to meet you finally, sir.  Andrew Breitbart in studio.  Yes.  All day, people have been correcting us.  Is it Breitbart or Breitbart?  It's Breitbart. 
[02:37:30]  It's Breitbart.  I said Breitbart.  I know.  Why do I have to have such a sexy name?  Yeah.  You're, uh, you've been everywhere lately.  I know.  And I've got the sweat to show for it.  Yeah, you're just a sweaty guy.  In my undercarriage and other extremities.  Yeah, you've been, like, walking, I guess, back and forth from news place to news place and shit.  I'm such a pedestrian scandal monger walking around the streets of New York, scandal monger.  Look, yesterday I was in every news studio from Matt Lauer, CBS, CNN, but I know how a news cycle works and, you know, there's nothing new today. 
[02:38:00]  Right.  So now I'm just going person to person on the street to tell them the story.  Just one-on-one and then something else will break.  Ask me anything.  Now, we're seeing a lot more of these transcripts come out about Wiener with the girl in Vegas, I guess.  The blackjack gal. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, the blackjack gal.  And they are a lot more graphic with him talking about, you know, his cock and I want to come inside that pussy, the wet pussy.  He's really getting graphic.  Look, we need to go to America's English grad schools and create a new nomenclature for sex.  You know, I'm sick of that stuff.  I mean, it's just so cliche.  Doesn't it seem like we have to come up with some better dirty language?  Yeah.  You bring up a great point because sometimes you're, you're, uh, because obviously I've done my share of sexting and whatnot. 
[02:39:00]  And you just feel so hack.  It's like, oh God, is your pussy wet again?  I can't, I've been with, I've been with my wife since 1992 where just going through Showtime movie channel and HBO and seeing a boob was my idea of what pornography was.  And to find out that we're in like pornography 75.0.  I mean, it's like the stuff that people are doing to get off now blows my mind. 
[02:39:30]  I just, I just walk in and I'll see like a, the, the side of a boob, not the cleavage because everybody shows the side of the boob and I'm done.  Yeah, that, that for you is still porn.  Yeah.  But you could go on, on the internet and really click, uh, and within, within seconds you're seeing animals fucking, uh, uh, you know, 15 on one.  Sure.  Uh, yeah, that's, uh, sure, sure.  I didn't say I was against that. 
[02:40:00]  No, no.  Well, it is, but he's in a better shape though because I'd rather not be desensitized.  Like, cause I have such a high threshold to, to get me off or whatever, but I would love to just see the side of a breast and still find that erotic.  I tell, like I tell people, I tell young kids when I meet them and I try and be their mentors said, when I was a kid, there was a scene in a movie called mischief, um, in which, uh, uh, Preston, Kelly Preston in this completely, uh, you know, 1950s puritanical scene. 
[02:40:30]  Uh, this guy gets, uh, opens up her bra for the first time and she has the most wonderful breasts in the world.  I go, you have to see this young men.  You have to see that.  Like that to me, mad at like, or, or did you see Lisa Bonet and Mickey Rourke and Angel Heart?  Yeah.  Like just the basics, the basics.  And now we're into this film, not just fucking like back of the ball shot.  And, you know, I can name on my hand, on one hand, the scenes where I saw like the, the, the muff, you know, and that was a special moment in a young boy's life. 
[02:41:00]  It was all right.  I mean, we're seeing inner flappage at this point now.  Well, I remember watching, uh, watching Porky's and, and you would see a shower full of girls, obviously no shaving going on back then, but it was, it was like, like you breathe deep.  Yeah.  That was exciting.  That was more.  That was over the top for even, you got to go back to like fast times.  No, but to me, that was Jennifer Jason Lee. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Or Phoebe Cates coming out of the pool.  Here's a director, here's a director trying to convince Jennifer Jason Lee to take her shirt off.  Uh, Jennifer, yes.  Just come across that way.  Thank you for asking.  No, but Phoebe Cates getting out of the pool shot.  Right.  Where she opens up the.  But that's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  101.  101.  Kids, go back to the basics.  Yeah.  Even the TV version of that scene is unbelievable.  Mm-hmm.  Where she doesn't actually show the tits.  Yeah.  Now, uh, obviously, uh, you, you've had some, uh, uh, photographs and, uh, texts and, and stuff from, uh, uh, Wiener. 
[02:42:00]  Mm-hmm.  Um, what were you feeling when, when you didn't think you'd get any vindication and you were listening to him saying, you know, this is all pretty much bullshit.  I was hacked.  Right.  And the press was.  And the press was buying it.  The press was trying, the press was trying.  Look, we birthed the story.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, we, we made it past Memorial Day weekend.  And that was what they thought that they could get away with was attack me on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. 
[02:42:30]  And that the press would say, we're not touching this story because it's a toxic Breitbart story.  This has been their tactic forever.  And I, I will give credit where credit is due.  Uh, CNN's Dana Bash, who's eight plus months pregnant, and her, uh, producer, Ted Barrett, who Wiener called jackass in that famous debacle.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah.  Uh, that to me was the turning point when anyone on the internet who has a brain, who was paying attention to this scandal, realized that this guy, you know, he went from hack on Friday night to, hey, it's a, uh, it's a prank. 
[02:43:00]  It's a prank.  It's a prank.  It's a prank hack.  It's a prank hack.  Like, I'm going to do a world-class self-investigation into my prank hack.  Self-investigation.  Yeah, right, right, exactly.  Don't bring anyone else in, please.  And I'm like going, okay, this isn't curious.  This guy, on Friday night, after he posted it and unposted it, erased his entire photo cache at the YFrog account.  And simultaneously, the girl in Seattle is getting rid of her Facebook page and her Twitter page. 
[02:43:30]  And all these things are happening furiously, and I'm watching it.  It's a cover-up.  Right, right.  And the press is like, well, we're going to believe the unbelievable here.  And it really was CNN's Dana Bash who, like, said, no, no, no, this doesn't make sense.  Well, when you called out the media and said, do your job, your journalists do your job.  They never do.  They're the worst.  We've talked about that for years.  They're the worst.  They're the worst.  They're the worst.  But you never get that moment of indication.  They're not just the worst. 
[02:44:00]  It's the sanctimony that they swim in.  They're the worst fucking people in the world.  Well, Stunk Wiener was using the word certitude, by the way.  Yes.  When he used the word certitude, I'm like, oh, boy, is this not going to end up with certitude.  Well, right now there's a whole bunch of dangling, as it were, you know, things like the certitude  thing, such as, like, he can't say with certainty that he didn't have communications with girls  who are underage.  What?  You can't make that.  I can.  I really can.  With certainty, I'm not talking dirty with underage girls. 
[02:44:30]  You're not.  What other congressman can make that claim that they're not sure?  Not sure.  How can there not be a Nancy Pelosi going, wait, wait, you're not sure that you are not  doing this type of stuff?  You're not sure with young girls?  Get the fuck out of here.  You psychopath.  He's obviously done now.  Do you think he's finished yet?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The transcript that I reread today is a goof.  It's really dirty, but it didn't show any sexual deviance other than what regular men 
[02:45:00]  think, but the underage thing will murder him.  That's rough for voters.  But also, as a politician, you can't get that part of you out there.  People aren't ready to accept their politicians as saying, I want you to suck my hard cock.  Yeah, yeah, but I'm telling you, the photo that I have, which I'm not releasing.  Right.  Congressman Wiener, if I had released that thing, you wouldn't have resigned.  You would have been running like the roadrunner out of town, okay?  This thing is just the filthiest, filthiest, narcissistic, blue boy, self-gay porn that I've 
[02:45:30]  ever seen.  And use the word narcissistic, this guy loves the attention.  Oh, yeah.  Like that press conference that you obviously, wow, you were great at, his part of it should  have been two minutes.  Say your thing and get the fuck out of there.  You noticed that, too.  40 minutes?  It's, I think it was 40 minutes, what are you doing?  To say the same thing over and over.  Because he loves the spotlight and the attention, but all for the wrong reasons.  Or what about the photos?  Is that the stuff that he's sending to these women, women, this, I didn't realize this until 
[02:46:00]  like I was 20.  I wish somebody could go back to Andrew at 14 and go, they just want to be hugged.  They just want to be told that they're pretty.  Just simple things.  Just like touch their hair, touch their hair, kiss them for two minutes longer than you  want to.  Okay?  Just the basics.  Okay?  They don't want to see a flaming hard cock.  Okay?  When you said that, too.  I'm sorry.  It's...  Oh, shit.  I hope you're wrong, because otherwise I've really upset a lot of people. 
[02:46:30]  Now, I've sent mine out to many folks.  Believe me.  But I want to say this, obviously, carefully.  These pictures that there's rumors about, will they see the light of day?  I've said the only way that I can imagine putting it out, it's an insurance policy for  the women.  I watched what the Clintons did with Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones.  I mean, those were women that he had affairs with and people that he didn't, such as Kathleen 
[02:47:00]  Willie, who he felt up in the White House, and Linda Tripp, who they made fun of her looks  and all that type of stuff.  If, in the pursuit of this investigation, and these women start coming forward, if he  starts releasing information on them, starts showing their photographs for nefarious purposes  as a means to try and intimidate them from coming forward or being forthright, fine.  I have no problem with that.  I hate bullies.  I've always hated bullies.  And if I start seeing these innocent women being brought into this and destroyed, I have 
[02:47:30]  no problem with putting it out.  But I honestly do not want this thing out there.  It really is going to degrade everything and everyone, including in her family.  There's nothing societally to be gained other than a grotesque snicker at his expense.  And let me ask this, too, though, because, again, he is a congressman, and I have to, like,  my standards are different than his, so I get that he's in trouble for this.  It was a dumb thing.  But I do have a problem with the women, not for talking dirty to him, but for now, all 
[02:48:00]  of a sudden, coming out in droves.  Because what happens is, you know, he's already admitted he screwed up.  Sending that picture was enough.  He screwed up.  When they're releasing these chat transcripts, there is a morbidity to that.  There is an attention-seeking, and that's not helping a criminal investigation.  It's not like he's being tried for rape or murder, and they're releasing pertinent facts.  This is morbidity on their part and voyeurism on their part.  So it's like I do kind of have a problem with them for piling on when it was a trusting 
[02:48:30]  between the two of them.  You're a sensitive cat.  No, no, no.  But you know what I'm saying?  I mean, their reasons are not necessarily pure for releasing their information.  Well, what's up with the Seattle girl?  Did she have a dirty talk with Wiener?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  I have no idea.  He had no problem throwing her under the bus.  Did he throw her under the bus, though, or did you say he didn't know?  Yeah, he said something like he didn't know. 
[02:49:00]  What I don't understand is he used the word that he sent it to her as a joke.  Okay, so he's saying I want to come on your forehead and all that type of stuff to everyone else,  but with this girl, he uses his penis as a joke?  Right.  So in this particular instance, he didn't want – I don't even understand that.  I don't either.  The joke, it didn't wash.  Well, he didn't know what –  Boing, boing, boing, boing.  Hey!  Well, when it comes to this, he's not a smart guy.  Let's be buddies. 
[02:49:30]  Let's have beer together.  When I'm in Seattle, I want to have beer with you.  Let's go to a Mariners game.  Yeah, he's –  You're going to be my new best buddy.  I just wanted to show you my funny boner.  He obviously was fishing.  He threw the hook in the water to see if she might be into some of these games he was playing.  She's like, I'm taking off my shirt.  No!  Absolutely not.  I want to go to the Mariners game with you.  That was a funny boner.  Right.  Now, obviously, you have this insurance picture.  Yeah, prove you got this insurance picture.  Can you – or would you describe it? 
[02:50:00]  Like, a lot of people are wondering what it is.  Give us an exclusive.  We've helped out your website over there, sir.  You always for Homeless Charlie.  You know that.  Are we going to get into that?  You always for that.  Come on.  It is satellite radio, so you can be as graphic as you want.  But there's a particular cinematic angle in which you're able to create the perception that something is larger than it actually is. 
[02:50:30]  Force perspective.  Yes.  Okay?  And then, you know, mostly, if I'm holding a camera and I'm looking down, you see something, you know.  But this guy somehow figured out how to do it from the exact opposite angle, looking up towards –  Ah, bottom up.  Yes.  Here's how I – here's what I would –  So it's like standing at the base of the Empire State Building with the camera phasing up.  Here's what I would title it.  If water was leaking off –  If I were to title this, and I'm like a photo editor at the AP, and I needed to come up with a title for it, I would call it TwoBallsOneShaft.jpg. 
[02:51:00]  Okay.  TwoBallsOneShaft.jpg.  TwoBallsOneShaft.jpg.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From the undercarriage perspective.  And is he fully aroused in this photo?  Oh, he's an excited chap.  An excited chap.  Yeah.  And I'm just talking –  I think he's the most heterosexual guy out there, okay? 
[02:51:30]  He really is.  But he's definitely reading all the magazines that give him the tips that will cause the men to go, whoa, this is my kind of guy.  I'm talking this guy, unless he has that hair disease where you don't have hair.  Oh, I got you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where it's –  Completely bald?  Not completely.  There might have been some shaving going on.  There's a bunch of manscaping going on.  There's a bunch of manscaping going on.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, manscaping.  This is Blue Boy Circa 2000 – let me think. 
[02:52:00]  Four-ish.  Blue Boy 2004-ish.  And now, is there a face in it?  Is there any other identifying –  It's the same torso.  Oh.  Okay.  It's like the – you know, it's the same –  There's no doubt.  The shadow of a nose on a wall or something.  And from the whole point, the whole point of all of these photos, including the ones of  him looking down, you know, what a weird, weird, grotesque facial expressions that he's 
[02:52:30]  making.  They're really – they're like narcissism.  Very creepy.  Yeah.  You know what?  It's like American Psycho 3, the congressman.  You know, it's just like, whoa, that's a gnarly look on your face, brother.  Yeah, and that's –  You think he practiced the look a few times until he got one he liked?  Yeah, he took a few shots.  That's not it.  That's not it.  Let me trust you.  The question is, is it him?  On that one, it's so 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999% because you don't see the head. 
[02:53:00]  But yeah.  She says that he sent it, representing it as such.  Right.  And it's clear that he's not sending them to make her aroused or happy.  He's trying to say, I'm 46 years old, and I've got a body that any guy in Greenwich Village, a 25-year-old, would want.  That's what he's trying to say.  It's a narcissistic thing.  So why would he send a picture of a body double when he's trying to say, look at how great looking I am and what great shape I am? 
[02:53:30]  It would make no sense.  I'm sorry.  It showed really bad judgment at the very least because what are you doing doing it from Rep Wiener or from sending it from your real Facebook?  It's like, get a dummy account, you moron.  What's the matter with you?  These are people who are vulnerable, especially if you're married and in an elected position.  It's just dumb.  Have you found out anything about his wife and she wasn't by his side?  All these guys, we've seen the wife by the side. 
[02:54:00]  Who's by his side?  I mean, even when he was in the denial phase and the press was trying to sweep this away, I'm thinking, and Dan Abash, I think, and Ted Barrett at CNN kind of figured out this as well.  Well, if he's an innocent, why isn't there anyone standing by him other than Charlie Rangel went ass?  Oh, yeah, this guy's great.  Well, who is that?  Was it Reed?  Was it Reed?  Me, Charlie Rangel.  Was it Reed?  You only have Rangel on your side.  You're in trouble.  Was it Reed on the news the other day that was talking about how he's not? 
[02:54:30]  Matt Damon's not even standing by him anymore.  He pulled out of a fundraiser that he was going to throw for him.  He did.  Oh, for him.  That's the person I want to have to step down.  Yeah.  I'm going to get Matt Damon to step down back.  Matt Damon to step down as just a human.  As a human.  Yes.  Why?  He's so in touch with the way most people think.  Hey, I got a really good question coming in from James in North Carolina. 
[02:55:00]  We got Andrew Breitbart on the show.  James, go ahead.  Hey, Mr. Breitbart.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  I'm just curious.  I hear fervor and vigor the way you go after the left.  Do you have this hard on for conservatives as well?  I don't quite hear that.  I don't know your opinion.  No, not really.  No, I don't, actually.  The difference between me is that the mainstream media are a bunch of lefties who masquerade  as being neutral, and I think that this entire experience has shown that they're not.  They did everything they could to cover up for a Democrat when they, with zeal, take down 
[02:55:30]  Craig and Foley.  And this is what they do.  And people come to me.  If there is a picture of a Republican congressman, they're not coming to lowly Andrew Breitbart,  who has a couple Internet sites.  They go to ABC, CBS, or NBC.  So these people come to me because they know that the mainstream media is biased, okay?  And I think that we have to move towards a more honest media, like in the United...  Let me finish my answer. 
[02:56:00]  We need to move towards a more honest media, like in the United Kingdom, where you've got  the Telegraph and the Daily Mail.  They're conservative.  And then you've got the Independent and the Guardian, and they're left of center.  I admit my biases here.  Now, if Orrin Hatch came to me with a...  If I had a picture of Orrin Hatch, Republican from Utah, with a raging hard-on, I guarantee  you I would make it news because my news judgment transcends my partisanship and my being a conservative. 
[02:56:30]  I go, but what are you talking about?  But you'd be friggin' tenth person getting that picture.  It would be all over CNN and ABC and NBC.  I'm sorry.  What a great point, too, by the way, that you made is that he's honest about you lean right.  But Fox is much more right-leaning, but everybody knows they are.  It's not a secret, whereas the other media, the media does masquerade as being neutral when  they're not.  Fox, at least, is honest about the fact that they lean right.  It is what it is.  I agree, but I just want to know, you're...  Okay, so you lean right. 
[02:57:00]  If, as a media source, so if somebody came forth with information...  I just said that about Orrin Hatch.  Yeah, he did.  That gives you so much...  I get a whole lot more respect for you right there.  Oh, I hate these people, by the way.  I live in Los Angeles.  I love it when these corrupt bastards go down.  I don't...  I didn't buy into the Clinton.  It's just about the sex.  It's just about the sex.  If you're out there peddling pictures of yourself to absolutely random people, absolutely random 
[02:57:30]  people, like, I have a raging hard-on pic of a congressman, and I don't...  I can't pay my rent.  Don't you think that that...  Don't you think that person could go to that congressman and say, did you see how...  Do you see how hard he's fighting to keep his job now that this information is out here?  My daddy wants you to pass the farm bill, and you're going to say no.  I think you should say yes.  You don't think that these people put themselves into blackmail situations on behalf of the American  people, Republicans and congressmen. 
[02:58:00]  It's not just about the sex.  You're putting the country at risk when you act like an asshole.  Wow.  100%.  But why didn't you go after Bush when he claimed, you know, the whole...  There weren't enough people going after Bush in the mainstream media?  What the hell are you talking about?  You needed one extra person in that pile-on.  Oh, shit.  I'm talking about a neutral person who is actually honest, not bullshit media who, as you said...  I just answered you.  I liked Bush, by the way.  I didn't think he was the devil.  Why didn't you protect Bush when they compared him to Hitler? 
[02:58:30]  Why weren't you there to protect him from the Hitler stuff?  Goes both ways.  All these wars.  Barack Obama's waging these wars right now.  I go, why...  I support anybody who's honest.  All right.  I'm honest.  Then support me.  He's being honest, but he's being honest about what these liberal Democrats are doing.  So what's the problem?  No, no, no.  You're talking about Bush and why I didn't support Bush.  All right.  So you're panicking.  I was happy, by the way.  We cannot get into a Bush.  Larry Craig, I was happy to see Larry Craig go because he legislates against gays, and 
[02:59:00]  I think he's very, very anti-gay.  And it's like, if you're anti-gay, man, you better not be fucking tapping into the men's  room.  And that was hilarious.  I got a lot of material on that.  I love that.  Right.  I go, I love a good scandal.  Excuse me, America.  How does this Wiener thing play out in your eyes now?  Oh, he's...  Look.  When does he resign?  He had two...  His value to the Democratic Party was to the Progressive Caucus. 
[02:59:30]  He was the most charming guy.  They just loved how he was in New York.  He ran around with models and energy.  Right, right.  And all that type of stuff.  And he had a cot at MSNBC where he'd go, Republicans are the worst.  Republicans are the worst.  Republicans are the worst.  And so he was a bulldog and he was the charmer.  I go, right now, in both categories, he's toxic and toxic.  They are going to come to him like Howard Baker in Watergate.  They're going to go to him and they're going to, bye-bye. 
[03:00:00]  Look, yeah.  You're out of here.  I don't care what you want to do.  He is on a strictly pragmatic level.  It is more beneficial for the Republicans for him to stick around between now and 2004.  Is he done for good?  Do you think it's like Spitzer?  He'll be the poster boy.  Will Spitzer come back?  Because people love a good mea culpa.  And again, if you come completely clean and time goes by, I wonder if Spitzer could possibly come back in some capacity now or in a couple of years.  Do you think?  Or is he totally finished?  Are you talking about Wiener? 
[03:00:30]  No, no.  I'm saying Spitzer.  Spitzer at first.  Spitzer.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Wiener?  Wiener's done.  Yeah, and I also will say this to the guy in North Carolina, is that media bias is everything to me.  I've built an entire company on the presumption that the media will not cover with zeal something that hurts the Democratic Party.  It's just a purest axiom.  But there's a huge asterisk next to this in Wikipedia now called, if your name is Wiener and you show you're Wiener, media bias cannot protect you. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, that's true.  God damn.  That's crazy.  They pile on once the story is too big to ignore.  That's so true.  Yeah.  You can't.  He got screwed by nomenclature.  By his name.  Someone wants to know if you were disappointed that O'Reilly didn't ask a lot of good questions last night.  Oh, I thought he asked the best questions. 
[03:01:30]  And my answers were even better.  There you go.  I think we see the picture eventually.  I don't know.  We're in the mop-up.  We're in the mop-up phase, folks.  Mop-up phase, yeah.  Yeah, I'm in a hazmat suit, and you should too.  Does he resign by the end of the week?  How long do you think?  It's just speculative.  He's got to be killed from the inside.  Is it Wednesday?  Thank God I orchestrated this on a Monday. 
[03:02:00]  For the slow burn.  Oh, this poor bastard.  He's hoping for an earthquake or something.  Yeah, I know.  I'd love to know what he was thinking.  Argentina has not had a 7.3 in a long time.  I'd love to know what he was thinking when people went up to him and said,  Wow, Breitbart's out on your fucking podium.  Giving a speech.  He must have gone through his head to either put it off, not show up, but obviously he's too conceded.  Oh, I got a phone call from a network producer that was like, 
[03:02:30]  What the hell were you doing?  Now he's not going to come up there.  That's what people thought.  Yeah.  I was being surrounded.  You can see it in the New York Times in the corner by about 50 reporters.  And they started saying, Go up on the stage.  Go up on the stage.  Talk to the microphone.  Go up on the stage.  And I'm usually not sheepish.  But in this case, I was.  I was like, Really?  Do you think I should?  Do you think?  Oh, okay.  Okay, fine.  I'll go up there. 
[03:03:00]  There's a legitimacy with that podium.  And I did not know until afterwards that this was being carried live.  I just thought that some of those cameras would cut some of that.  Oh, they broke in.  Oh, that freaked me out everywhere.  People were calling me up and going, How did you maintain your calm and your poise up there?  I said, I didn't know I was on live TV.  Which makes it a lot different.  Yeah, I would have been completely frantic and a loser, you know, if I knew that everyone was watching.  The other way, you could see the edits in your head like, Ah, they're not going to use that. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, you're live the whole time.  I'll tell you Wiener's reaction.  When somebody said Breitbart is up at the podium, his first reaction, Who?  Who?  But it goes back to the narcissistic thing.  He couldn't help himself.  He had to come out.  He had to come out.  Can I tell you an idea that I have right now?  Sure.  Let's go.  I want to do a reality show called Road Trip from Hell.  And it's like, I want to pair people like, I don't know, Ted Nugent and Ingrid Newkirk from PETA and force them to run the country. 
[03:04:00]  This is my, this is my, this is my, I will do the pilot with Wiener.  And the two of us will travel the country and I'll show him my America.  He can show me his America.  We'll figure out what we, you know, on Sirius Radio, they'll help sponsor it.  We'll find out what music we have in common.  We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, it'll be sponsored by Hotwire.  We'll pick our hotels as we go around and we'll see whether or not we can bring America back together.  That's a great idea. 
[03:04:30]  I don't see Wiener doing that.  I don't see him being happy.  I'm just that, that offer is out there and I'm saying that utterly seriously.  Congressman Wiener, you and me, Road Trip, we'll go see bands down in the South, bar bands.  We'll do everything.  We'll, we'll go to, uh, baseball games together, sit out in the bleachers.  Who used to tour?  Timothy Leary and, uh, G. Gordon Liddy, I think.  I grew up watching that.  I love street theater.  I love performance art.  Yeah.  Let's do it, baby.  Larry Flint and, um.  Oh, right.  And I think, uh, was it Pat Robertson or it was one of those guys? 
[03:05:00]  No, Jerry Falwell?  Falwell.  I think, uh, and also Larry Flint was involved with Jimmy Carter's sister, I think, who was very  religious and they became good friends because she was totally against what he did and his  pornography, but he heard her and she listened to him and they just became friends.  And yeah, once you sit down and actually talk to these people, that's, that's something,  that's an idea.  Just get them cruising around.  Let's do it.  Like together where they can't, can't really get apart from each other.  You have nothing to lose, Congressman. 
[03:05:30]  Look how happy he is.  You can only go up.  I know.  Well, it was very happy.  Well, I was great, man.  He destroyed my family's Memorial Day weekend when I was being attacked as the hacker.  You were the hacker.  And so, excuse me while I gloat.  When he apologized, yes, I want to apologize to Andrew Breitbart.  You know, that for you must have just been amazing.  By the way, my publicist is listening.  I am the worst in the world.  My book, Righteous Indignation, Excuse Me While I Save the World, tells the story of 
[03:06:00]  what we just went through.  It's how you take on the mainstream media.  I call it the Democrat media complex, the natural alliance of the Democratic Party,  liberal interest groups, and the mainstream media.  And I say, this is how you take them on with new media.  You can beat the old media with the tricks that I did.  This is a how-to book.  This is how we're going to do it.  Buy video cameras, okay, and go out there and expose these corrupt bastards. 
[03:06:30]  And I wish, again, the point is that none of them are honest about being biased.  I argue with people all the time because they're like, why do you go on Fox?  And I'm on Fox a lot.  And it's like, well, they don't censor me there.  Hannity treats me great.  Gutfeld and Red Eye guys treat me great.  Yeah.  They don't fuck with what I'm doing.  How could you go on that network?  I'm like, well, you go on biased networks on CNN.  They just don't think the other networks are biased.  They don't think MSNBC is biased.  I don't get it.  Is that crazy?  I don't think I can live. 
[03:07:00]  I honestly almost want these people who believe that.  I admit that Fox leans to the right, okay?  Why can't they admit that MSNBC is hard left and unapologized?  And if they can't admit that basic thing, I'm not sure that they can drive.  I'm not sure that they can do any handled babies.  Andrew, can we scoot you to that seat?  Because Vincent D'Onofrio is going to be here.  Oh, no.  This guy is a huge fan, I guarantee. 
[03:07:30]  This guy loves conservatives.  We were kind of saying that before you got here.  He's the complete opposite.  Is he conservative?  Is he going to punch me?  He's really left.  Is he?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That should be fun.  No, it'll be fun.  We'll see what he has to say.  Oh, boy.  Hey, look, Fezzy.  Yeah, this, I've never, I actually saw him once at a Q&A after a screening of Full Metal  Jacket.  Wow.  And it was pretty cool. 
[03:08:00]  It was Matthew Modine, him, and one other person, maybe Cowboy or something.  Adam Baldwin is a close, close friend.  Animal Mother.  Animal Mother.  Full Metal Jacket.  He's also in My Bodyguard.  I was stunned.  He follows me on Twitter.  I was like, well, that's the coolest fucking thing.  Animal Mother there.  Oh, does he?  Adam Baldwin?  Yeah, Adam Baldwin.  He's very conservative.  Yeah, really.  I read his stuff and I'm like, wow.  He's an intellect, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He's a self-taught guy.  He was a liberal, too.  Like, like I was. 
[03:08:30]  And he just started reading all this stuff.  Yeah.  Kind of like David Mamet, whose new book just came out.  That is just absolutely, if you're out there and you want to read the best book ever, it's  called The Secret Knowledge.  And it is just one, like, hit to the head after another.  It's just unbelievable.  So you were a liberal initially?  Like, in the shallowest way you possibly could growing up in college where, you know, I just  said the reflexive things that you were supposed to do. 
[03:09:00]  Like, yeah, the man is a racist, you know, you know, just, you know, every single thing  that and I believed it.  All the catchphrases.  Yeah, I just had the catchphrases.  And so when I hear the catchphrases now, I go, I know I used to say them too.  And I didn't even know why I believed them.  You didn't.  You had no idea why you had that mindset.  Well, I mean, there's such a constant reinforcement in that world.  Like, I don't know, women, you know, you're like, yeah, hey, yeah, absolutely, man.  Ben Carter, he's for peace in the Middle East. 
[03:09:30]  And the next thing you know, you're in bed.  You know, how did that happen?  Wow, I never would have had you pegged.  Hi, I'm a conservative and I have strong moral values.  Would you like to sleep with me?  No.  It doesn't work as well.  It just makes you sound like you're going to be a stiff, not literally, you know, figuratively  a stiff in the sack.  Man.  Let's talk about Glenn Close.  Okay.  Okay, Glenn Close is walking around too.  Of course.  Of course.  We're talking about social causes.  Like, let's put our dispossessed people together. 
[03:10:00]  Let's have a mixer.  I'd love to know what that conversation is.  But everybody loves it.  Glenn Close is Glenn Close.  Everybody knows her.  It's like, there's no action that wouldn't stop.  She's really far left too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A lot of people in Hollywood are.  She's a big Obama supporter.  There's a book coming out about.  I've heard that.  I mean, it's bizarre how that mentality is all.  I don't understand why.  I think it's the more out of touch.  I really think the more out of touch you are and the more elitist you are, it just drives 
[03:10:30]  you in that direction.  Now, there's something with the mentality that causes you to go into that job.  It's like a certain part of the brain you use.  I'm not saying a better or worse part.  Oh, you're saying it's the other way around, like that type of thing makes you go into  the arts?  I don't know.  I just don't know.  As it were.  I really don't know.  But there is a reason for it.  Like so many artists or musicians or actors all lean that same way.  See, I used to agree with you on that. 
[03:11:00]  And I wrote a book in 2004 that was like an attack on celebrity culture.  And that's what I thought.  But what I now know, and I know thousands of conservatives in Los Angeles who have started  to find each other, is that conservatives do exist.  There are punk rockers.  There are artists.  There are every possible stripe you can imagine.  Brand names who you perceive to be liberal.  Your brain has tricked you to believe that they're liberal because of something that  they said at an event.  But they are not. 
[03:11:30]  And the reason why is the same reason that you don't hear a lot of people saying they  don't like Castro in Cuba.  They're going to lose their jobs.  You're not allowed to go off the island.  It is a totalitarian system.  Yeah.  Oh, there we go.  Pleasure.  Pleasure.  How are you doing, Vincent?  How are you doing?  How are you?  Wow.  How are you doing?  Hi.  Take a seat.  That's Andrew.  And that's Hopi.  Likewise.  You know Andrew?  Breitbart?  No.  Oh, okay. 
[03:12:00]  Husky male model.  They saw some photos of me in Belgium and they said, we've got to get this guy across  the sea to talk.  Well, you're looking good for a male model.  Yeah.  Big bone.  A little sweaty, but sweaty and big bone.  All right.  It is blazing hot out there.  Vincent D'Onofrio, how are you doing?  Good, I hope.  Good.  What do they got you roaming around for?  The last season?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we shot the last eight episodes.  Last eight episodes, they brought you back? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Which is kind of cool.  What did you leave for in the first place?  I was done.  Were you done?  Yeah.  You had it?  You wanted to move on?  Yeah, but you work for somebody like Dick Wolf for so long and the show was in trouble  and he gave me a call and asked me to come back and finish it off with eight because he  just didn't want it to end in a bad way.  And we shot eight.  They started to air a few weeks ago and we've got some of the highest ratings in cable television.  Wow.  There was a little connection here. 
[03:13:00]  My girlfriend, actually, was in one of the episodes, the one with Jay Moore.  You know what?  Jay Moore played some kind of a lunatic.  Yeah.  Charlie Sheen character.  Yeah, yeah.  He played that lunatic designer guy.  Well, she was actually in one of the photographs that were on the wall.  She was in there.  Yeah, yeah.  She was in for like, she did a whole shoot with Jay Moore and stuff and some of the filming  stuff.  So we were watching and she goes, I end up on a wall in a room. 
[03:13:30]  I was like, yeah, well, that's what happens.  And my connection is I've done half of the things you guys have covered criminally.  I auditioned one time for Law and Order because all comedians have at least gone out for it.  And I had to play like a porno store guy.  How did that work out for you?  Obviously not well.  I didn't get the part.  Couldn't do it.  But yeah, for me not to be able to play that well is just kind of humiliating.  When you moved on from the show, what were you looking to do?  Do you want to get back into movies or just relax?  Yeah, no, I'm going to go off and do a Jennifer Lynch film in a couple of weeks. 
[03:14:00]  And, you know, I'm going to, yeah.  Yeah, you'll still be around, obviously.  So it's tough.  But I guess the idea is to, I sold my first film that I wrote and directed to Tribeca Films,  which will be released in the winter.  And it's called Don't Go in the Woods.  And we're going into pre-production in another one for the next one in September.  So, you know, I'm doing my own thing.  And I'm just going to do what I did before the show is just do character roles in films. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  When you act, it's like acting is, and I talk to all real actors about it.  It's a very hard thing to do.  I mean, you know what's really hard in acting?  Standing and listening to somebody talk.  And making it look authentic.  That's because you do radio, dude.  No, no, no.  You just can sit here.  But I'm a stand-up, and it's like I've gotten plenty of acting auditions.  And it's like when you're talking to somebody, you have to stand and act like you're listening.  You're just like, I'm stiff.  I'm not moving.  I'm dying in the scene.  I'm not doing anything.  It's very hard to do. 
[03:15:00]  It's not that hard.  That's the difference between him and me.  First of all, you don't act like you listen.  You listen.  Just listen.  But how do you listen?  Like right now, we're listening to each other because we're both talking live for the first time.  The key is making it seem like you've never heard it before.  You mean like now?  Right.  That's exactly it.  That's exactly it.  That's the hard part.  Okay.  All right.  We screwed that up.  The key is making it seem like it.  Now look at his hands. 
[03:15:30]  He's doing this.  I'm overdoing it.  I admire great acting.  It's so difficult to do and it looks so easy, but it's those little things that are hard to do.  Well, I actually, I understand what you mean.  I feel similar.  And when I see great actors work, I'm astounded every time.  So I get it.  Vincent, I've always wanted to ask an actor this.  How did Bronson Pinchot do that?  What did he do?  The Bronson Pinchot stuff. 
[03:16:00]  I don't know what you're talking about.  Not only do I not know who you are, I don't know what you're talking about.  Like when we played Bilky or something like, and he was like, eh.  That was his genius.  Yeah.  That was his genius.  I couldn't do that.  I actually worked with him one time.  That's what I was asking.  How did you work with him?  Oh, I see.  Now I get what you're saying.  He did the show once.  Oh, he did?  Okay.  Yeah, that was his thing.  You know, he was able to do all this bizarre stuff and get away with it. 
[03:16:30]  Did he play bad guy?  Yeah, he did.  On the show?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think he really wanted to step away from that Bilky thing.  In acting, can you just simply go in there and be yourself reading yourself and get away with it?  A lot of people do.  A lot of people make careers out of it.  I think Walken does that at this point now where he's such an interesting guy.  Anyway, it's like you don't need to see Walken become somebody else like Gary Oldman.  You see Gary Oldman and it's like he's Oswald or he's this white Jamaican drug dealer.  But Walken almost all is so interesting. 
[03:17:00]  It's like I want to see what Walken does as him.  He's so – you don't look at him to become someone else.  You want to see him doing something.  Does that make any sense?  Yeah, I mean Chris is a good example.  I mean I just did a film with Chris called Kill the Irishman which is out and just did very well in the theaters and just came out on DVD.  And Chris is the kind of guy who has this background of doing incredible performances in his career.  I mean if you think about his performance in Deer Hunter, that's one of the things that inspired me to be an actor was that performance. 
[03:17:30]  There's a scene when he's at the hospital after he gets lindered and he has this monologue.  He's sitting on a fence, a gate of a porch of one of the hospitals and he has this monologue and they're asking him about his mother's name.  They ask him his mother's name.  Oh, right.  Do you remember that?  I can't remember.  Yeah, it's an incredible scene, you know, and so you think – and a lot like De Niro too who landed all these great roles when he was young and did incredible performances. 
[03:18:00]  So you see these guys now and, you know, they don't have the opportunity to do those parts, kind of parts anymore.  But they are still those guys that did those incredible performances that even today nobody can match.  You know, like so when I hang out with Chris Walken, all I see is this artist who did this incredible stuff in his career. 
[03:18:30]  And so he's always that to me.  When you watch a film, I mean, you got – obviously everybody knew you.  The first exposure we had to you was in Full Metal Jacket and it was such a – I mean, it was one of those things where were you afraid you would not be able to be seen as anything but that?  Because it was such a powerful – I mean, it was a Kubrick film and it was such a powerful role.  I mean, that's the most memorable thing in the movie is your behavior, your character.  When I did that part, I was too young to think that deep into it. 
[03:19:00]  Really?  Yeah, honestly, I just thought I was happy for not being fired and I hope I get another job.  But I didn't know what was going on.  I came back here to the city and started bouncing again in bars.  You just didn't think it was going to be a big thing.  By the way, that's exactly what Adam Baldwin said about the part in Full Metal Jacket you were talking about.  Yeah, he said I was too young to even understand what was going on.  Yeah, we were all very young.  Kubrick just grabbed a bunch of kids and threw them in there.  Did you find him as a –  I think the only one that truly understood what was going on was Modine. 
[03:19:30]  Because he had done several really good films before that.  Yeah.  And he's a smart dude.  And he was more experienced with that.  I'll speak for myself.  Definitely more experienced in film than I was at the time.  Was he good to work?  Who do we have in – oh, we had Malcolm McDowell.  Who do we have?  Malcolm.  Who also did my show, Malcolm.  Was he on Law & Order?  Yeah, he did.  Well, sure, everyone.  Everybody has done Law & Order.  He said, though, but he said that the myth about Stanley doing 80 takes or whatever, he said, like, he was talking about the scene in Clockwork, Orange with the Eyes. 
[03:20:00]  He said that did 10 takes, maybe.  He said it wasn't.  Yeah, I don't know where that came.  Well, actually, I do know where it came.  There was an actor, I won't say who, that did 70-something takes on Criminal Intent.  I mean, not on Criminal Intent, I'm sorry, on Full Metal Jacket.  So Stanley – I did see Stanley do that with an actor.  Was it the actor screwing up or was it –  But Matthew and I, I think definitely me, I averaged, you know, from five to seven takes, stuff like that. 
[03:20:30]  I mean, nothing more – nothing out of your –  Nothing crazy.  My favorite unsung hero from Full Metal Jacket who never gets the play he deserves is –  What's that, some tiny thick joke?  That guy was the greatest, that old-school colonel.  So, oh, was he fantastic – was he like a real military guy?  He couldn't be an actor, that guy.  He looks like an old-school military dude.  I think he was like an actor from here, yeah.  And Arlie Ermey was a real D.I., but was he an actor –  Because he did Mississippi Burning after he's done a bunch of stuff. 
[03:21:00]  He had done something before that, too.  Oh, he had Boys and Company C.  Boys and Company C, he did that, and obviously he's playing the D.I.  Yeah, but he started on our show, on Full Metal Jacket, he started as the technical advisor.  And then he just turned out being so good at it.  Right.  I remember seeing you after Full Metal Jacket, and that's all I had seen you in up until then.  And then you were in, I guess, Adventures in Babysitting.  Right.  You played Thor, I guess, with the hammer.  Best movie ever. 
[03:21:30]  I'm not kidding you.  I tell my kids to this day, I can't explain to you why this is the best movie I've ever seen.  It's hilarious.  It's unbelievable.  I couldn't figure out who you were, though.  The Thor girl is unbelievable.  That girl is the best actor I've ever seen.  I don't care what anyone says.  The little girl, you mean.  Yeah, she's unbelievable.  I've never believed a part of my life like that.  And Elizabeth Shubu in that movie is the most attractive person I've ever seen.  She's always been very, very purdy.  I've never been unattractive, Elizabeth Shubu. 
[03:22:00]  No, I know.  Leaving Las Vegas, she was really sexy.  She's always great.  I was looking at you in that, and the face, I was like, I know who that is, but I can't place it.  Right.  Because obviously, did you gain weight for the role?  Yeah, back then, yeah.  But since no one had seen you really that much beforehand, they just knew you as that.  So I'm like, this guy's in shape and everything.  I was like, holy fuck, that's Private Pyle.  Yeah, I did.  I think I did Mystic Pizza before I did Adventures in Babysitting.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  It might have come out first.  I'm not sure which one came out first.  But I waited seven months to take off the weight, and then I started to audition again for... 
[03:22:30]  Was that tough, taking the weight off, or just kids, so you just don't eat and run around?  I think it was I put it on so quickly, and I really knew what to do already to get it off.  So it was hard.  What?  Tell us.  Tell us.  Well, I mean, back then, I was young.  We were all young one time, and it was, you know, I used to run 11 miles like every other day in New York.  Right here in New York, you know?  Really?  I can't even think about doing that now. 
[03:23:00]  I mean, we used to, you know, we had a, you know, I was active.  I was an active guy when I was younger.  And so, you know, it took a while to get it off safely and stuff.  You know, I didn't want to starve myself or anything silly.  So I just did it the right way, and I waited.  And I did get offered a couple of bad guys in films during that period that they wanted that kind of look that was in Full Metal Jacket, but I just didn't do them.  And I waited, and then I got Mystic Pizza, and that was the first part that I got at my normal size. 
[03:23:30]  And I got to play a different kind of character, and then they asked me to do that Thor thing, and then I went and did that.  And then I just started to work steady after that.  Yeah.  Did you, when did everybody start realizing, like, ooh, got something there with Full Metal Jacket?  I think this is going to be a classic.  I think Kubrick pretty much takes care of that.  Yeah.  You know, it's just, you work with him, and you know whether you like the movie or not, it's going to be interesting for sure.  Did you like it?  Full Metal Jacket? 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I love Full Metal Jacket.  Oh, good, good.  I was hoping you would say, because you said that.  I was like, oh, please don't dislike Full Metal Jacket.  Please don't dislike Avengers and Babysitting.  Please tell me you don't like Avengers and Babysitting.  I mean, the Blu-ray one came out.  I do like that movie, actually, yeah.  It's, in fact, it's one of the only ones that my kids can see.  Oh, hey, yeah.  That's true.  How old are they?  Good parenting.  Well, I've got, well, the 19-year-olds.  Do you have them locked up this week in New York over Wienergate?  Oh, geez.  Oh, no.  Well, I don't talk to them about Wienergate at all, no.  No.  How old are they? 
[03:24:30]  Well, I do with my kids.  My daughter's 19.  You're responsible.  But she's in Australia.  She wouldn't know about Wiener.  So, yeah, but I have an 11-year-old son and a 3-year-old son.  How old are they going to see Full Metal Jacket?  Like 16, 17, before you're like, oh, you can...  I think my son, with the video games and everything, will be able to see it next week.  Yeah, Call of Duty.  Start playing Call of Duty.  It's like, ah, don't worry about it.  My 11-year-old has seen it.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  And he loved it.  My father's ex-military, ex-marine.  He goes, bananas for that fucking film.  He just, ah.  Well, it just came out on Blu-ray, and I watched the...  I'm not interested in seeing the first half, because it's...  I just don't like doing that, but...  Which is interesting, because some people watch the first half.  Most people love the first half.  That's weird.  Do you not like watching yourself act...  Yeah, I think it's odd.  I think it's weird to watch yourself do your performance.  It's like, it kind of gives you, like, an ill feeling.  So, but the second half is so amazing, and I remember seeing the first, I remember the 
[03:25:30]  first time I saw it on the big screen, you know, and this Blu-ray version of it is exactly  what I remember seeing.  Because up until this Blu-ray version, I was questioned, I was so...  It was always a question in my mind whether the framing was right, and whether the colorization  was right.  And this second half, for sure, I know, is exactly the way...  It looks to me exactly the way Stanley showed it the first time. 
[03:26:00]  What's the framing, do you mean?  Because didn't he shoot, like, Strangelove in a couple of different ways?  He shot...  It's hard, like, when you watch Letterboxx, sometimes even in a Kubrick Letterboxx, it will  be, like, a full-screen thing.  Well, see, the thing is, is that because of televisions and because of different choices  you get on DVDs to what frame you want to use, people are messing with their own frames  all the time, and a lot of times people don't even know they're seeing a movie because of  their TV is set on the wrong ratio, in the wrong ratio.  They're seeing the movie in the wrong ratio. 
[03:26:30]  Well, the way that I saw it on this DVD Blu-ray, it was the correct ratio, and it was just incredible.  We talk about that all the time, and how a director must want to pull his friggin'  hair out when he looks at what they do to their movies to fit, you know, especially,  you know, old-school 4.3 televisions.  Right.  It's just got to be horrid for a director.  I worked that hard, and you're cutting off both sides of my movie.  It's a tough thing, and like I said, you know, these fancy-schmancy televisions that 
[03:27:00]  are out, you can change the ratio on your screen.  You don't even know that you've done it.  Yeah.  And it's got to be an odd thing, you know.  Did you turn down, it says allegedly, because sometimes our prep sheets are wrong, more times  than not.  Did you turn down a role in The Sopranos?  People say that.  I had talks with David Chase, and I would have loved to have done a role in The Sopranos.  I just couldn't afford to do it.  Oh, the finances weren't right, and you had something else going on? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, I mean, first of all, if I had done that and not done Criminal Intent, I can't imagine  having not done Criminal Intent for 10 years, and so it's a little strange to answer the  question, but there was conversations between David Chase and I, and I, you know, I remember  being very honest with him, you know, because I would have loved to have been on that show.  The writing was so good, especially when it was a young show.  It was amazing.  David Chase was amazing, and whoever he had working for him at the time, it was amazing  stuff, but I remember having a conversation in my kitchen with him, and I just, you know, 
[03:28:00]  HBO wasn't, you know, paying very much.  Yeah.  I would have to sell my house to do that show.  In fact, I think I told him that.  When you do a role, when you look at a script for the first time, do you immediately get  memorized it, and as they say, get off book with it, or a lot of guys don't do that?  Oh, you're using, like, fancy actor terms.  Yeah, that's why I said a lot of guys say off book.  I'm surprised you're not a good actor. 
[03:28:30]  You handled the off book thing really well.  I'm not a bad actor, but no matter what the scene is, I raise my hand in proclamation form  when I'm speaking, and that tends to take a lot of people out of the moment.  Even now it's good.  Yes, a lot of people tell me I wave like royalty.  All right.  Do you, because, like, they say De Niro won't memorize everything, and he won't do it in  character when he's rehearsing because he doesn't want to make, he doesn't want to, like,  ingrain mistakes or ingrain, get a bad habit with a role.  Like, he'll just kind of say it during rehearsals.  Or do you immediately know what you want to do with it and kind of start telling it? 
[03:29:00]  Well, I mean, you have to know the text, obviously.  You have to know the words.  So I guess if you're asking me what I do, I read the script over and over and over again,  and I try not to memorize anything.  And you certainly don't ever memorize a line the way you think you're going to act it,  like with the inflections and everything in it.  You don't do that because then you're locked into a certain way of doing it, and that's  just bad acting.  You know, you want to be, you want to know all the words but not plan too much. 
[03:29:30]  You want to know the history of your character.  You want to know all the words.  You want to, if you're doing a character actor like I do a lot, you want to have all  the layers of your character in you and ready to go, your posture, your voice.  It's, you know, it's like juggling two balls or five balls.  You know, you can pick how many balls you want to juggle while the camera's rolling,  you know?  And so you have all that stuff set.  But as far as actual the words of the author, you wait.  I mean, I wait. 
[03:30:00]  And I know them, but I don't know how I'm going to say them.  I know what they're going to sound like, how my character's going to sound, and how he's  going to move and stuff.  But I don't, if you lock yourself in, you're finished acting.  Like, if you lock yourself into the way you're going to say your line, then your job's over.  You want your job to be evolving the whole time while some, because you have to react.  You don't know how the other actors are going to do what they're going to do and stuff.  I was just thinking about listening.  He said about listening is so important. 
[03:30:30]  If you kind of, I guess, know how you're going to say it, then regardless of what they  say, your reaction is currently built in.  Correct, you also don't know what the director is going to want.  You may know what he wants, kind of, but then when the director sees the scene, I mean,  directors, in my experience, they know more once they've seen it, so they add to it.  Do you like a more hands-on director or somebody that lets you kind of?  I've worked with all the different, I mean, Stanley didn't talk about story or anything 
[03:31:00]  at all.  He didn't say anything.  He just kind of let you do it until he liked what he saw?  Exactly.  He would just say, it's not right.  That's what I heard from, like, even Malcolm said the same thing.  He kind of was hands-off.  He didn't want to talk about anything.  But he would give you clues, you know, like I've told this story before, but when I was  walking, we were going to shoot the bathroom scene in Full Metal Jacket, the big scene  where I killed the sergeant and then myself.  I don't remember that scene.  You just ruined the film for me.  Spoiler alert. 
[03:31:30]  Thanks a lot.  It's only like 20 years old.  I remember going to, walking out into the parking lot.  Stanley was walking to his car and I was walking to mine.  And he said to me, do you know what you're going to do tomorrow?  We were going to shoot the scene the next morning.  And I said, I think so.  And he used to clear his throat.  You know, he was like a Jewish guy from the Bronx.  Yeah.  He was an awesome, smart guy, I got to tell you. 
[03:32:00]  But he would clear, he'd always go, when he talked, you know.  And he said, do you know what you're going to do tomorrow?  And I said, I think so.  And he started to walk away and then he stopped and I could hear his throat clear.  So I knew he was going to say something else.  So I turned and he said, it has to be, whatever you do, it has to be big.  It has to be lawn cheney big.  That's what he said to me.  And he got in his car and he laughed. 
[03:32:30]  Wow, lawn cheney big.  And it kind of comes off a little lawn cheney-ish.  Yeah, so he knew, he definitely knew how to inspire his actors, you know.  But, you know, there are other directors that want to talk about every scene, every little thing and whatever.  And, you know, you use what you understand.  You know, it's hard to understand somebody else's vision.  But you use whatever you can to, you know, try and do that.  That clipped, horrifying speech.  The music they put in, the little, the very low music, whatever they put was a terrible impression of the music. 
[03:33:00]  But it was great, the underlying, but that clipped speech, it was horrifying.  And that combined with the Kubrick look, that whole look he did.  And talk about reading the moment wrong, fucking Sergeant Hartman.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, a little tact.  Boy, did you not realize what, yeah, could you mellow out a little bit, be nice to him for once?  A little tact.  Yeah, that was a guy who really was committed to the cause.  They're saying we have to get, we have to wrap.  Let's promote.  Vincent's obviously here promoting.  The Blu-ray of Full Metal Jacket. 
[03:33:30]  And everybody knows Law & Order, Criminal Intent.  It's the final season.  It's Sundays, 9 o'clock.  The great shows.  On USA.  You're happy with the final eight.  We did eight of the best shows I think we've done.  I know that the crew and the actors and the producer, Mary Rae Thewlis, and the showrunner, Chris Brancato.  It's the most fun that we've had.  Those eight were the most fun we've had in ten years.  That's very cool.  And, of course, Andrew Breitbart, he's the guy that broke open the Wienergate thing. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  Now I know I haven't felt like I liked him the whole time.  My intuition works every time.  I was kind of thinking, it's like, all right, we've got Breitbart in here.  That hardcore leftist intuition works every time.  I was going to scoot my chair over a little bit.  Jesus, I had no idea.  Yeah.  Italians feel it in their left arm, you know, when something's up. 
[03:34:30]  And all the whole time, my left arm is starting to say, something's going on here.  There's something going on there.  You hear that?  Oh, shit.  Now, I'm like the Margaret Mead of liberals.  I could have predicted that response.  Is there a partition that we could slide in here?  Now, obviously, I know through your history and stuff, politically, you're a little more  left-leaning than I would say Andrew is.  Well, I'm actually not that political, but I am on the left side, yeah. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Have you, what about Adam Baldwin?  Have you read any of his stuff on Twitter?  Because he's very conservative.  He's one of my closest friends.  He's a wonderful guy.  Great family guy.  Adam is an awesome guy.  No, and I haven't read anything, and I have no idea what Adam's political stuff is.  It is odd that people can just get along so well with every, you know, with every aspect  except politics.  Well, you know, look, I actually, you know, all joking aside, you know, I do lean to the 
[03:35:30]  left, but I also work with a lot of...  So does Wiener.  Right.  Yeah.  See, I don't find that kind of stuff funny at all.  No.  No, and I just think the whole thing is in poor taste, but my point is this, is that  I work with attorney generals around the country for law enforcement, and a lot of them are  Republicans, and I actually agree with a lot that they're trying to do for law enforcement  and stuff, and I do as much as I can.  I travel all over the country and to Washington. 
[03:36:00]  And you do.  You have a charity, too.  Yeah, the Meth Cops Project.  I also am the face of the National Law Enforcement Museum that they're building in Washington.  I had the campaign with John Shanks on that.  I do a lot of stuff for Republican guys.  You know, I got...  I don't take a stand, and I'm not the kind of actor that's going to speak out about the  Democrats.  Not a Sean Penn type.  No, I'm just...  It's just not my personality to do that.  I like to...  I think of things in a moral way more than I do in a political way. 
[03:36:30]  Didn't you say something untoward things about President Bush?  Who, me?  Yeah.  What did I say?  I just...  I'm just...  I think that there have been a lot of things out there.  I'm just...  I'm just asking you.  I might have when he was...  Who...  Yeah.  I don't know.  What did I say?  I could...  If I said something clever, I want to know what it is.  Because I doubt I said something else.  Something clever like he's equal to Hitler or something cute like that.  Oh, I don't think I said that.  Oh, I know what I did do one time in Australia. 
[03:37:00]  They asked me for a song that I thought related to George Bush.  It was on a radio station.  And I picked They're Coming to Take Me Away.  Do you remember that song?  Yeah.  I think that's the worst thing I ever did.  Yeah.  That's the worst thing I ever did.  Lunatic.  Lunatic.  Yeah.  But if you have better stuff, tell me.  I would.  I'd like to...  I'm going to go get my iPad.  Well, get your...  We have to wrap up, though, unfortunately.  I wish we had that one. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, shit.  What did he say?  He went, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Jesus Christ.  And do you know...  Do you know...  This is what a self-centered asshole I am.  The whole time this is happening is like...  All I care about is I don't want their argument to affect Vincent liking me.  I can't worry.  Vincent will love you.  I'm teasing.  I'm teasing.  No argument.  You guys.  Jesus Christ.  No, you're on opposite ends of the spectrum.  Actors love me.  The spectrum.  Actors love him. 
[03:38:00]  Yes, they do.  They do, Andrew.  I love you.  I'm a comic.  I'm not an actor, but I love you.  Thank you.  I was drinking with Andrew the other night, having a couple of wines after I taped Red Eye,  and, you know, had a few things on the Wiener Gate thing, so, yeah, we had a little  chat about it.  Well, it's definitely a conversation that needs to be had.  Well, you know what?  Definitely does.  I mean, it's not, it's not, it's certainly not something to just...  Just another guy that tripped over his own...  Yeah.  He cannot say with certainty that he wasn't having these conversations with underage girls. 
[03:38:30]  That's deeply problematic.  Well, I, you know, I thought that it was definitely a problem when he started to sound like he  had, like, a catalog of pictures of his thing, but he didn't know how they got to it.  You know, that was the weird thing to me.  That, I thought, I was in Utah at the time.  Yeah.  Doing stuff for law enforcement, and I thought, okay, so tomorrow he's going to admit that  it's his thing.  Right.  You know, like, you knew that it was coming.  Right.  He's got to.  Yeah, I wish that if they, when they get caught doing these silly things, which I think that's 
[03:39:00]  all it really is, it's just silly, I think that they should just admit it because...  The lie is always worse than the event.  Dude, in this day and age, if you're going to do things like that, then you should expect  you're going to get caught, and when you do get caught, fess up right away, and we'll  deal with it a lot easier.  Because now you got that and the lie.  Ah, problem.  Yeah, break down and cry, say you're sorry the minute they catch you, and people, like  Sutherland said in JFK, people are suckers for the truth. 
[03:39:30]  I thought we learned that lesson with Clinton.  Oh my God, it was just a whole line of, oh Jesus.  What?  Did he get something nice?  I think he's got something.  Come on, come on, come on, say it.  No, no, no, is it a photo?  Take a look.  We can just see the photo, I mean, there's no camera.  Let's see Jimmy.  You want it?  Yeah.  That's the famous.  I do.  Let's see, that's the famous.  That's the real one?  Wow.  I think that's really his?  Yeah.  He sent that? 
[03:40:00]  To Andrew.  To Andrew.  Who did he send it to?  To a gal down in Texas.  Wow.  That's a good angle, though.  He's a smart guy, but I think...  He's in very good shape.  All I can say is, from seeing that picture, I want that guy as mayor.  Because he is loaded.  That is what is called the atomic bomb, though.  Yeah, well, that's the one that's going to kill everything.  Has not.  But they can't show that on television, though. 
[03:40:30]  No.  That is true.  They can't.  But on the internet, they could, under an explicit thing.  I think that anybody that sees this photo should elect this guy from New York.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he's definitely well-equipped.  He's well-equipped for the job.  You need a good set when you're running this city.  You do.  Wowee.  Go ahead.  Take a look.  Wowee.  Do you know...  By the way, I'm not releasing it.  I'm not releasing it.  I can't think of any other publication that wouldn't.  I could probably get a gazillion hits off my page. 
[03:41:00]  I'm not doing that to him and his family.  That's my stated position.  You're awesome for that.  Thank you.  Seriously.  Yeah, it's awesome.  You get everybody in trouble.  I have to...  You lunatic.  I got to say...  Yes, Jim, as an expert.  Believe me.  Well, I just want to say it's the second time he's looked at the photo.  No, no, no.  He couldn't easily just pass it all the way back.  All right.  I'm at 17.  What does that mean?  Fair enough.  He makes a good point.  I really did stop and look again like there was a change going to occur. 
[03:41:30]  There really wasn't.  Can I see it?  Can I just got to see it?  Go ahead.  There was a change going to occur.  I just got to see for a second.  It is a good angle, I would say.  It's a good angle.  What would you say?  Oh.  Good angle?  Don't show it anywhere.  No, no.  Good angle?  Oh, you're crazy.  I would think it's...  Because it's underneath.  Here you go.  Yeah.  That is the angle you should...  That is the angle you should take.  Well, I think that that breaches, I think... 
[03:42:00]  I mean, don't we all feel that in the end...  I'm not sure if you feel this way, sir, but I think that most people...  I know that my wife and I, and I think that most husbands and wives and couples and friends  are having the same conversation that we're having right now.  No, they're not.  I think that a lot of people are, actually.  And I think that one of the things that's always said in a conversation like that is,  at some point you have to say, this guy did this stuff, but it is his personal choice to do that stuff. 
[03:42:30]  Vincent, can I pose to you something here?  And I can think, off the top of my head, more Republicans who've engaged in this type of stupidity.  Off the top of my head, Larry Craig and Mark Foley.  And this is not a partisan thing.  I've never bought the, it's just about sex, and tell me where I'm wrong thinking here.  If this girl, or another girl, has this picture from a congressman, a complete stranger, just dissented, 
[03:43:00]  and she now can say to him, do you want this photo to go public?  You can see how he was reacting over the last weeks to try and frantically cover his career.  I need you to vote this way on this bill.  They're putting themselves into a position where they can so easily be blackmailed.  They have to...  So easily, yeah.  Yes, and that's the problem that I have with it.  That is a big problem.  But I will say, though, that, as we all know as grown men, that we don't know the true circumstances that led to any of these photos. 
[03:43:30]  We weren't there in the room when he was communicating with whoever he was communicating with.  The six girls?  We don't know anything about what this guy thinks in his head and how he gets into these conversations.  I don't think it's that deep, though.  I think it's guys.  Why does it matter?  The act itself is manifestly.  I know through my experience in life being an actor and trying to explore people in general, you can't really judge anybody unless you live with them, you know them. 
[03:44:00]  I never lived with Hitler.  You know how that happened.  Yeah, well, I've dated him a few times.  But Hitler didn't send pictures of his penis.  Indeed, he did.  It's different.  Indeed, he did.  Did you ever think you'd have to ever say that?  I know, but it's actually a good line. 
[03:44:30]  It really is.  It'd be a good autobiography for Anthony Weiner.  It's a great title of a book.  Well, look, we've got to wrap up.  Well, Vincent's got to go.  Vincent's got to go.  He's got a lot of places to be.  I do.  I've got to thank you guys so much.  Vincent, thanks so much for coming.  I've been a huge fan, man.  Sunday's 9 o'clock on USA, the final season.  And Vincent shot the final eight episodes, and you could tell that he's genuinely happy  with them.  Absolutely.  And, you know, I don't need to promote Law & Order.  You all know the show.  Yeah. 
[03:45:00]  And, of course, you know Brightbox.  And, Andrew, you want to plug your side?  Righteous Indignation, Excuse Me While I Save the World.  Righteous Indignation, Excuse Me While I Save the World.  My book.  Get it at Amazon or, I'm sure, any book.  And, of course, what website do you want people to check in?  BigGovernment.com, BigJournalism, BigHollywood, where you can read everything you want about  the great Vincent D'Onofrio.  How would you stop it?  I'm serious.  I like this guy.  I like your acting a lot.  I do.  Fantastic.  I know.  All right, gentlemen.  All right. 
[03:45:30]  We got to get out of here.  And the rest of the show, take it easy.  Thank you guys very much.  Take care, man.  Thanks, Vincent.  Andrew, thank you.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Opie and Anthony.  The Anthony and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it. </pre>
